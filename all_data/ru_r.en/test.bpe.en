"B@@ y the end of this year , there &apos;ll be ne@@ arly a billion people on this planet that ac@@ ti@@ vely use social net@@ working sit@@ es ."
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
"Wh@@ ile that might be a some@@ what mor@@ bi@@ d thought , I think it has some really pro@@ found imp@@ lic@@ ations that are wor@@ th expl@@ or@@ ing ."
"What first got me thinking about this was a blo@@ g pos@@ t au@@ th@@ o@@ red ear@@ li@@ er this year by D@@ ere@@ k K@@ . M@@ ill@@ er , who was a science and technology jour@@ nal@@ ist who di@@ ed of cancer ."
And what M@@ ill@@ er did was have his family and friends write a pos@@ t that went out shor@@ tly after he di@@ ed .
Here &apos;s what he w@@ ro@@ te in star@@ ting that out .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m de@@ ad , and this is my last pos@@ t to my blo@@ g ."
"In adv@@ ance , I asked that once my body finally sh@@ ut down from the pu@@ ni@@ sh@@ ments of my cancer , then my family and friends publi@@ sh this pre@@ pa@@ red mes@@ sage I w@@ ro@@ te — the first part of the process of tur@@ ning this from an ac@@ tive we@@ b@@ s@@ ite to an ar@@ chi@@ ve . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a jour@@ nal@@ ist , M@@ ill@@ er &apos;s ar@@ chi@@ ve may have been better writ@@ ten and more care@@ fully cur@@ ated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are cre@@ ating an ar@@ chi@@ ve that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any pre@@ vi@@ ous gener@@ ation ."
Con@@ si@@ der a few stat@@ s for a moment .
R@@ ight now there are 4@@ 8 hours of video being u@@ plo@@ ad@@ ed to Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be every single minut@@ e .
There are 2@@ 00 million T@@ we@@ ets being post@@ ed every day .
And the aver@@ age F@@ ace@@ book us@@ er is cre@@ ating 9@@ 0 pi@@ ec@@ es of con@@ t@@ ent each mon@@ th .
"So when you think about your parents or your gran@@ d@@ parents , at best they may have created some ph@@ ot@@ os or home vide@@ os , or a di@@ ary that lives in a bo@@ x some@@ where ."
"But today we &apos;re all cre@@ ating this incredi@@ bly ri@@ ch dig@@ ital ar@@ chi@@ ve that &apos;s going to live in the cl@@ ou@@ d inde@@ fin@@ it@@ ely , years after we &apos;re gone ."
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredi@@ bly in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing opport@@ unities for tech@@ nologi@@ sts .
"Now to be clear , I &apos;m a jour@@ nal@@ ist and not a technolo@@ g@@ ist , so what I &apos;d like to do bri@@ ef@@ ly is pain@@ t a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like ."
Now we &apos;re already seeing some ser@@ vi@@ ces that are desig@@ ned to let us deci@@ de what happens to our on@@ line prof@@ ile and our social medi@@ a ac@@ coun@@ ts after we die .
"One of them actually , f@@ it@@ tin@@ g@@ ly enough , found me when I ch@@ ec@@ ked into a deli at a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in New York on f@@ our@@ squ@@ are ."
( R@@ ec@@ or@@ ding ) A@@ da@@ m O@@ stro@@ w : H@@ ell@@ o .
De@@ ath : A@@ da@@ m ?
A@@ O : Yeah .
"D@@ e@@ ath : De@@ ath can cat@@ ch you any@@ where , any@@ time , even at the O@@ r@@ g@@ ani@@ c ."
A@@ O : Wh@@ o is this ?
De@@ ath : G@@ o to i@@ fi@@ di@@ e@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too l@@ ate .
"( Laughter ) A@@ da@@ m O@@ stro@@ w : K@@ ind of cre@@ ep@@ y , right ?"
"So what that ser@@ vice does , quite simply , is let you create a mes@@ sage or a video that can be post@@ ed to F@@ ace@@ book after you die ."
"A@@ no@@ ther ser@@ vice right now is called 1@@ ,000 M@@ em@@ ories ."
"And what this l@@ ets you do is create an on@@ line tri@@ bu@@ te to your lov@@ ed ones , compl@@ ete with ph@@ ot@@ os and vide@@ os and stories that they can pos@@ t after you die ."
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
"Now a lot of you are probably famili@@ ar with De@@ b R@@ o@@ y who , back in Mar@@ ch , demon@@ strat@@ ed how he was able to anal@@ y@@ ze more than 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video ."
"I think as mach@@ ines &apos; ability to understand human language and process v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of data contin@@ ues to impro@@ ve , it &apos;s going to become possible to anal@@ y@@ ze an entire life &apos;s wor@@ th of con@@ t@@ ent — the T@@ we@@ ets , the ph@@ ot@@ os , the vide@@ os , the blo@@ g po@@ sts — that we &apos;re produc@@ ing in such mas@@ sive num@@ bers ."
"And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our dig@@ ital person@@ as to contin@@ ue to inter@@ act in the real world long after we &apos;re gone th@@ an@@ ks to the va@@ st@@ ness of the amount of con@@ t@@ ent we &apos;re cre@@ ating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all ."
Now we &apos;re already star@@ ting to see some experim@@ ents here .
"One ser@@ vice called My N@@ ex@@ t T@@ we@@ et anal@@ y@@ z@@ es your entire T@@ w@@ it@@ ter stre@@ am , everything you &apos;ve post@@ ed on@@ to T@@ w@@ it@@ ter , to make some predi@@ ctions as to what you might say next ."
"Well right now , as you can see , the resul@@ ts can be some@@ what com@@ ical ."
"You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our tech@@ ni@@ cal cap@@ abil@@ ities impro@@ ve ."
"Ta@@ king it a step f@@ ur@@ ther , M@@ I@@ T &apos;s medi@@ a la@@ b is working on robot@@ s that can inter@@ act more like humans ."
But what if those robot@@ s were able to inter@@ act based on the uni@@ qu@@ e charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of a speci@@ fic person based on the hun@@ dre@@ ds of thousands of pi@@ ec@@ es of con@@ t@@ ent that person produc@@ es in their li@@ f@@ et@@ im@@ e ?
"F@@ in@@ ally , think back to this fam@@ ous sc@@ en@@ e from elec@@ tion night 200@@ 8 back in the United States , where C@@ N@@ N be@@ am@@ ed a live hol@@ ogra@@ m of hi@@ p ho@@ p art@@ ist w@@ ill@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ am into their studi@@ o for an inter@@ view with An@@ der@@ son C@@ o@@ op@@ er ."
What if we were able to use that same ty@@ pe of technology to be@@ am a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of our lov@@ ed ones into our living ro@@ om@@ s — inter@@ ac@@ ting in a very li@@ fel@@ ike way based on all the con@@ t@@ ent they created while they were ali@@ ve ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re produc@@ ing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both ex@@ p@@ and ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally .
"Now in clo@@ sing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a de@@ fin@@ ition of life and everything that comes after it ."
Thank you very much .

P@@ eople re@@ tur@@ ning to work after a care@@ er bre@@ ak : I call them rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ ers .
"Th@@ ese are people who have taken care@@ er bre@@ ak@@ s for el@@ der care , for chil@@ d@@ care reas@@ ons , pur@@ su@@ ing a pers@@ onal inter@@ est or a pers@@ onal health issue ."
"C@@ lo@@ sel@@ y rel@@ ated are care@@ er trans@@ iti@@ on@@ ers of all kinds : vet@@ er@@ ans , mil@@ it@@ ary spo@@ us@@ es , re@@ ti@@ re@@ es coming out of re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment or re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ating ex@@ pat@@ s ."
R@@ et@@ ur@@ ning to work after a care@@ er bre@@ ak is hard because of a dis@@ conne@@ ct between the em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers and the rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ ers .
"E@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ers can view h@@ ir@@ ing people with a ga@@ p on their re@@ su@@ me as a high@@ -@@ risk pro@@ pos@@ ition , and individu@@ als on care@@ er bre@@ ak can have d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts about their abil@@ ities to rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch their care@@ ers , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally if they &apos;ve been out for a long time ."
This dis@@ conne@@ ct is a problem that I &apos;m trying to help sol@@ ve .
"Now , succ@@ ess@@ ful rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ ers are every@@ where and in every fiel@@ d ."
This is S@@ ami K@@ af@@ ala .
He &apos;s a nu@@ clear physi@@ c@@ ist in the U@@ K who took a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak to be home with his five children .
The S@@ in@@ ga@@ po@@ re pres@@ s rec@@ ently w@@ ro@@ te about n@@ ur@@ ses re@@ tur@@ ning to work after long care@@ er bre@@ ak@@ s .
"And spe@@ a@@ king of long care@@ er bre@@ ak@@ s , this is M@@ imi Ka@@ h@@ n ."
"S@@ he &apos;s a social work@@ er in O@@ ran@@ ge C@@ oun@@ ty , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , who re@@ turned to work in a social ser@@ vi@@ ces organiz@@ ation after a 2@@ 5@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak ."
That &apos;s the lon@@ g@@ est care@@ er bre@@ ak that I &apos;m aw@@ are of .
Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t Ju@@ st@@ ice S@@ an@@ d@@ ra D@@ ay O &apos;@@ Con@@ no@@ r took a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak early in her care@@ er .
"And this is T@@ ra@@ cy S@@ ha@@ pi@@ ro , who took a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak ."
T@@ ra@@ cy ans@@ wer@@ ed a call for es@@ says by the T@@ oday S@@ how from people who were trying to re@@ turn to work but having a difficult time of it .
"T@@ ra@@ cy w@@ ro@@ te in that she was a mom of five who lov@@ ed her time at home , but she had gone through a di@@ vor@@ ce and needed to re@@ turn to work , pl@@ us she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she lov@@ ed working ."
T@@ ra@@ cy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we &apos;ve put in a good day in the job sear@@ ch .
"S@@ he was looking for a fin@@ ance or ac@@ coun@@ ting ro@@ le , and she had just sp@@ ent the last n@@ ine months very d@@ il@@ ig@@ ently resear@@ ching companies on@@ line and ap@@ pl@@ ying for j@@ ob@@ s with no resul@@ ts ."
"I met T@@ ra@@ cy in Ju@@ ne of 20@@ 11 , when the T@@ oday S@@ how asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around ."
The first thing I told T@@ ra@@ cy was she had to get out of the house .
I told her she had to go public with her job sear@@ ch and tell everyone she knew about her inter@@ est in re@@ tur@@ ning to work .
"I also told her , &quot; &quot; You are going to have a lot of con@@ vers@@ ations that don &apos;t go any@@ where ."
"E@@ x@@ pe@@ ct that , and don &apos;t be dis@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed by it ."
"There will be a han@@ d@@ ful that ul@@ tim@@ ately le@@ ad to a job opport@@ unity . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what happened with T@@ ra@@ cy in a little bit , but I want to share with you a discover@@ y that I made when I was re@@ tur@@ ning to work after my own care@@ er bre@@ ak of 11 years out of the ful@@ l@@ -@@ time work@@ for@@ ce ."
"And that is , that people &apos;s view of you is f@@ ro@@ z@@ en in time ."
"What I mean by this is , when you start to get in tou@@ ch with people and you get back in tou@@ ch with those people from the past , the people with wh@@ om you worked or went to school , they are going to remember you as you were before your care@@ er bre@@ ak ."
"And that &apos;s even if your sense of self has d@@ im@@ in@@ ish@@ ed over time , as happens with so many of us the far@@ ther re@@ mo@@ ved we are from our profes@@ si@@ onal id@@ ent@@ ities ."
"So for example , you might think of y@@ ourself as someone who looks like this ."
"This is me , c@@ raz@@ y after a day of dri@@ ving around in my min@@ iv@@ an ."
O@@ r here I am in the kit@@ ch@@ en .
"But those people from the past , they don &apos;t know about any of this ."
"They only remember you as you were , and it &apos;s a great con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence bo@@ o@@ st to be back in tou@@ ch with these people and hear their en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m about your inter@@ est in re@@ tur@@ ning to work ."
There &apos;s one more thing I remember vi@@ vid@@ ly from my own care@@ er bre@@ ak .
And that was that I har@@ dly k@@ ept up with the business news .
"My back@@ ground is in fin@@ ance , and I har@@ dly k@@ ept up with any news when I was home car@@ ing for my four young children ."
So I was af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;d go into an inter@@ view and start talking about a company that didn &apos;t ex@@ ist any@@ more .
So I had to re@@ sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ be to the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ nal and read it for a good six months c@@ over to c@@ over before I felt like I had a han@@ dle on what was going on in the business world again .
"I believe rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ ers are a g@@ em of the work@@ for@@ ce , and here &apos;s why ."
"Th@@ in@@ k about our life stage : for those of us who took care@@ er bre@@ ak@@ s for chil@@ d@@ care reas@@ ons , we have fe@@ wer or no mat@@ ern@@ ity le@@ av@@ es ."
We did that already .
We have fe@@ wer spo@@ us@@ al or part@@ ner job re@@ lo@@ c@@ ations .
We &apos;re in a more set@@ t@@ led time of life .
We have great work experience .
We have a more mat@@ ure perspe@@ ctive .
We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at an em@@ plo@@ y@@ er &apos;s ex@@ pen@@ se .
"P@@ l@@ us we have an energy , an en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m about re@@ tur@@ ning to work pre@@ c@@ is@@ ely because we &apos;ve been away from it for a while ."
"On the f@@ li@@ p side , I speak with em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers , and here are two con@@ cer@@ ns that em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers have about h@@ ir@@ ing rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ ers ."
"The first one is , em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers are wor@@ ri@@ ed that rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ ers are technolo@@ g@@ ically ob@@ sol@@ ete ."
"Now , I can tell you , having been technolo@@ g@@ ically ob@@ sol@@ ete myself at one point , that it &apos;s a tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry cond@@ ition ."
I had done my finan@@ cial anal@@ ys@@ is so long ago that I used L@@ ot@@ us 1@@ -@@ 2@@ -@@ 3 .
"I don &apos;t know if any@@ one can even remember back that far , but I had to re@@ learn it on E@@ x@@ c@@ el ."
It actually wasn &apos;t that hard . A lot of the com@@ man@@ ds are the same .
"I found Po@@ wer@@ Po@@ in@@ t much more chall@@ eng@@ ing , but now I use Po@@ wer@@ Po@@ in@@ t all the time ."
I tell rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ ers that em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers expe@@ ct them to come to the table with a working knowled@@ ge of ba@@ sic off@@ ice manag@@ ement so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
"And if they &apos;re not up to spe@@ ed , then it &apos;s their respon@@ sibil@@ ity to get there ."
And they do .
I tell rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ ers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interest@@ s and sk@@ ill@@ s have changed or have not changed while they have been on care@@ er bre@@ ak .
That &apos;s not the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er &apos;s job .
It &apos;s the rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ er &apos;s respon@@ sibil@@ ity to demon@@ str@@ ate to the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er where they can ad@@ d the most val@@ ue .
B@@ ack in 20@@ 10 I started not@@ ic@@ ing something .
"I had been tra@@ c@@ king re@@ turn to work progra@@ ms since 200@@ 8 , and in 20@@ 10 , I started not@@ ic@@ ing the use of a shor@@ t-@@ ter@@ m pa@@ id work opport@@ unity , whether it was called an inter@@ n@@ ship or not , but an inter@@ n@@ shi@@ p@@ -@@ like experience , as a way for profes@@ sion@@ als to re@@ turn to work ."
I saw G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s and S@@ ar@@ a L@@ ee start cor@@ por@@ ate re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ ms .
"I saw a re@@ tur@@ ning engine@@ er , a no@@ n@@ trad@@ iti@@ onal re@@ ent@@ ry can@@ di@@ d@@ ate , ap@@ ply for an ent@@ ry@@ -@@ level inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ m in the mil@@ it@@ ary , and then get a per@@ man@@ ent job af@@ ter@@ ward ."
I saw two univers@@ ities in@@ te@@ gr@@ ate inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps into mid@@ -@@ care@@ er ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive education progra@@ ms .
"So I w@@ ro@@ te a re@@ port about what I was seeing , and it became this arti@@ cle for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ in@@ ess Re@@ view called &quot; &quot; The 4@@ 0-@@ Y@@ ear@@ -@@ O@@ ld Inter@@ n . &quot; &quot; I have to th@@ ank the ed@@ it@@ ors there for that t@@ it@@ le , and also for this art@@ work where you can see the 4@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old inter@@ n in the mid@@ st of all the colle@@ ge inter@@ ns ."
"And then , cour@@ t@@ es@@ y of F@@ o@@ x B@@ us@@ in@@ ess Ne@@ ws , they called the conc@@ ept &quot; &quot; The 5@@ 0-@@ Y@@ ear@@ -@@ O@@ ld Inter@@ n . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So five of the bi@@ gg@@ est finan@@ cial ser@@ vi@@ ces companies have re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ ms for re@@ tur@@ ning fin@@ ance profes@@ sion@@ als ."
"And at this point , hun@@ dre@@ ds of people have parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated ."
"Th@@ ese inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps are pa@@ id , and the people who move on to per@@ man@@ ent ro@@ les are com@@ man@@ ding comp@@ et@@ itive s@@ al@@ ari@@ es ."
"And now , se@@ ven of the bi@@ gg@@ est engine@@ ering companies are p@@ il@@ ot@@ ing re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ ms for re@@ tur@@ ning engine@@ ers as part of an in@@ iti@@ ative with the So@@ ci@@ ety of W@@ om@@ en En@@ g@@ ine@@ ers ."
"Now , why are companies em@@ bra@@ cing the re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship ?"
"Because the inter@@ n@@ ship allo@@ ws the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er to b@@ ase their h@@ ir@@ ing deci@@ sion on an ac@@ tual work sam@@ ple instead of a seri@@ es of inter@@ vi@@ e@@ ws , and the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er does not have to make that per@@ man@@ ent h@@ ir@@ ing deci@@ sion until the inter@@ n@@ ship period is over ."
"This test@@ ing out period re@@ mo@@ ves the perc@@ ei@@ ved risk that some manag@@ ers atta@@ ch to h@@ ir@@ ing rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ ers , and they are at@@ tra@@ c@@ ting exc@@ ell@@ ent can@@ di@@ dat@@ es who are tur@@ ning into great hi@@ res ."
Th@@ in@@ k about how far we have come .
"B@@ e@@ fore this , most em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers were not interest@@ ed in eng@@ ag@@ ing with rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ ers at all ."
"But now , not only are progra@@ ms being develop@@ ed speci@@ fic@@ ally with rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ ers in mind , but you can &apos;t even ap@@ ply for these progra@@ ms un@@ less you have a ga@@ p on your r@@ é@@ sum@@ é ."
"This is the mar@@ k of real change , of true instit@@ u@@ ti@@ onal shi@@ ft , because if we can sol@@ ve this problem for rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ ers , we can sol@@ ve it for other care@@ er trans@@ iti@@ on@@ ers too ."
"In fact , an em@@ plo@@ y@@ er just told me that their vet@@ er@@ ans re@@ turn to work progra@@ m is based on their re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ m ."
And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a re@@ ti@@ ree inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ m .
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent po@@ ol , same conc@@ ept ."
So let me tell you what happened with T@@ ra@@ cy S@@ ha@@ pi@@ ro .
R@@ em@@ ember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her inter@@ est in re@@ tur@@ ning to work .
"Well , one c@@ rit@@ ical con@@ vers@@ ation with another par@@ ent in her community led to a job off@@ er for T@@ ra@@ cy , and it was an ac@@ coun@@ ting job in a fin@@ ance de@@ part@@ ment ."
But it was a tem@@ p job .
"The company told her there was a pos@@ sibil@@ ity it could turn into something more , but no gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es ."
This was in the f@@ all of 20@@ 11 .
"T@@ ra@@ cy lov@@ ed this company , and she lov@@ ed the people and the off@@ ice was less than 10 minutes from her house ."
"So even though she had a second job off@@ er at another company for a per@@ man@@ ent ful@@ l@@ -@@ time ro@@ le , she decided to take her chan@@ ces with this inter@@ n@@ ship and hope for the best ."
"Well , she en@@ ded up blo@@ wing away all of their expe@@ c@@ t@@ ations , and the company not only made her a per@@ man@@ ent off@@ er at the beginning of 20@@ 12 , but they made it even more interesting and chall@@ eng@@ ing , because they knew what T@@ ra@@ cy could han@@ dle ."
"F@@ ast for@@ ward to 20@@ 15 , T@@ ra@@ cy &apos;s been pro@@ mot@@ ed ."
They &apos;ve pa@@ id for her to get her M@@ B@@ A at night .
She &apos;s even hi@@ red another rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ er to work for her .
"T@@ ra@@ cy &apos;s tem@@ p job was a tr@@ y@@ out , just like an inter@@ n@@ ship , and it en@@ ded up being a w@@ in for both T@@ ra@@ cy and her em@@ plo@@ y@@ er ."
"Now , my go@@ al is to bring the re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship conc@@ ept to more and more em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers ."
"But in the me@@ an@@ time , if you are re@@ tur@@ ning to work after a care@@ er bre@@ ak , don &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to su@@ gg@@ est an inter@@ n@@ ship or an inter@@ n@@ shi@@ p@@ -@@ like ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment to an em@@ plo@@ y@@ er that does not have a form@@ al re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ m ."
"B@@ e their first succ@@ ess story , and you can be the example for more rel@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ ers to come ."
Thank you .

It was an af@@ ter@@ no@@ on in the f@@ all of 200@@ 5 .
I expla@@ ined to Ch@@ ris that I was feel@@ ing a little bit stu@@ ck .
The second quot@@ e is from the head of the U@@ K F@@ in@@ an@@ cial S@@ er@@ vi@@ ces A@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , the answer is yes ."
"Th@@ en , predi@@ ctions can be made and test@@ ed ."
So what do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole is liter@@ ally more than the su@@ m of its parts .
Wh@@ ere are economic net@@ works ?
What we looked at in det@@ a@@ il was ow@@ ner@@ ship net@@ works .
And we also as@@ sig@@ n a val@@ ue to the company given by the oper@@ ating re@@ ven@@ ue .
How are they organiz@@ ed ? A@@ re they is@@ ol@@ ated ?
"Th@@ ese are companies that oper@@ ate in more than one country , and we found 4@@ 3@@ ,000 ."
Let me expla@@ in by gi@@ ving you this anal@@ og@@ y .
"H@@ i . T@@ oday , I &apos;m going to take you through g@@ lim@@ p@@ ses of about e@@ ight of my pro@@ jects , done in col@@ labor@@ ation with D@@ an@@ ish art@@ ist S@@ ore@@ n P@@ ors ."
"We call ourselves P@@ ors and R@@ a@@ o , and we live and work in India ."
"I &apos;d like to beg@@ in with my very first ob@@ ject , which I call &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was in@@ spi@@ red by my un@@ cle &apos;s pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar h@@ ab@@ it of con@@ stan@@ tly as@@ king me to do things for him , almost like I were an ex@@ ten@@ sion of his body — to turn on the li@@ ghts or to bring him a glas@@ s of water , a p@@ ack of ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ t@@ es ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , it became wor@@ se and wor@@ se , And I started to think of it as a form of control ."
"But of course , I could never say anything , because the un@@ cle is a re@@ spe@@ cted figure in the Indi@@ an family ."
And the situ@@ ation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ sti@@ fi@@ ed me the most was his use of a lan@@ dl@@ ine tele@@ phone .
He would h@@ old on to the rec@@ ei@@ ver and expe@@ ct me to di@@ al a number for him .
"And so as a respon@@ se and as a gi@@ ft to my un@@ cle , I made him &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it re@@ qui@@ res two people to use it ."
It &apos;s exactly the way my un@@ cle us@@ es a phone that &apos;s desig@@ ned for one person .
"But the problem is that , when I left home and went to colle@@ ge , I started mis@@ sing his com@@ man@@ ds ."
And so I made him a gol@@ den ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er through which he could dis@@ pen@@ se his com@@ man@@ ds to ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws and ni@@ ec@@ es around the world as an em@@ a@@ il .
"So what he had to do was take a piece of pa@@ per , ro@@ ll it into the car@@ ri@@ age , ty@@ pe his em@@ a@@ il or comm@@ and and pul@@ l the pa@@ per out ."
This de@@ vice would au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally sen@@ d the in@@ ten@@ ded person the let@@ ter as an em@@ a@@ il .
"So here you can see , we em@@ bed@@ ded a lot of elec@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs that under@@ stan@@ ds all of the me@@ chan@@ ical ac@@ tions and con@@ ver@@ ts it to dig@@ ital ."
So my un@@ cle is only de@@ al@@ ing with a me@@ chan@@ ical inter@@ face .
"And of course , the ob@@ ject had to be very gr@@ and and have a sense of rit@@ u@@ al@@ ism , the way my un@@ cle lik@@ es it ."
"The next work is a s@@ oun@@ d-@@ sen@@ s@@ itive inst@@ all@@ ation that we aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately call &quot; &quot; The P@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a not@@ ion of being sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sen@@ s@@ itive and s@@ we@@ et cre@@ at@@ ures ."
"So how it works is we have these pan@@ els , which we have on the w@@ all , and behind them , we have these little cre@@ at@@ ures which hi@@ de ."
"And as so@@ on as it &apos;s sil@@ ent , they sort of cre@@ ep out ."
"And if it &apos;s even more sil@@ ent , they stre@@ t@@ ch their ne@@ cks out ."
"And at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hi@@ de back again ."
So we had these pan@@ els on three w@@ all@@ s of a room .
And we had over 500 of these little py@@ g@@ mi@@ es hi@@ ding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video pro@@ tot@@ y@@ pe .
"So when it &apos;s qui@@ et , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the pan@@ els ."
"And they hear like humans do , or real cre@@ at@@ ures do ."
So they get im@@ mu@@ ne to s@@ oun@@ ds that sc@@ are them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t re@@ act to back@@ ground s@@ oun@@ ds .
You &apos;ll hear a tra@@ in in moment that they don &apos;t re@@ act to .
( N@@ o@@ ise ) But they re@@ act to fore@@ ground s@@ oun@@ ds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( Wh@@ ist@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as li@@ fel@@ ike as possible .
"So each py@@ g@@ my has its own behavi@@ or , p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e , mo@@ od sw@@ ings , person@@ al@@ ities and so on ."
So this is a very early pro@@ tot@@ y@@ pe .
"O@@ f course , it got much better after that ."
"And we made them re@@ act to people , but we found that people were being quite pla@@ y@@ ful and chil@@ d@@ like with them ."
This is a video inst@@ all@@ ation called &quot; &quot; The M@@ is@@ sing Per@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with pla@@ ying with the not@@ ion of in@@ vi@@ sibil@@ ity .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of in@@ vi@@ sibil@@ ity ?
"So we worked with a company that speci@@ aliz@@ es in cam@@ era sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance , and we asked them to devel@@ op a piece of so@@ f@@ tw@@ are with us , using a cam@@ era that could look at people in the room , tra@@ ck them and re@@ place one person with the back@@ ground , ren@@ der@@ ing them in@@ vi@@ sible ."
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early pro@@ tot@@ y@@ pe .
"On the right side you can see my colle@@ ag@@ ue S@@ ore@@ n , who &apos;s actually in the space ."
"And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the proc@@ ess@@ ed video where the cam@@ era has made him in@@ vi@@ sible ."
S@@ ore@@ n en@@ ters the room . Po@@ p ! He goes in@@ vi@@ sible .
And you can see that the cam@@ era is tra@@ c@@ king him and er@@ as@@ ing .
"It &apos;s a very early video , so we hav@@ en &apos;t yet de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty so@@ on , later ."
"So how we used it was in a room where we had a cam@@ era looking into the space , and we had one mon@@ it@@ or , one on each w@@ all ."
"And as people wal@@ ked into the room , they would see themselves in the mon@@ it@@ or , exc@@ ept with one difference : one person was con@@ stan@@ tly in@@ vi@@ sible wh@@ er@@ ever they mo@@ ved in the room ."
"So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Su@@ n S@@ ha@@ do@@ w . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a she@@ et of pa@@ per , like a c@@ ut@@ out of a chil@@ d@@ like dra@@ wing of an oil sp@@ ill or a su@@ n ."
"And from the front , this ob@@ ject appe@@ a@@ red to be very stron@@ g and ro@@ bu@@ st , and from the side , it almost se@@ em@@ ed very we@@ ak ."
"So people would wal@@ king into the room and they &apos;d almost ig@@ no@@ re it , thinking it was some cra@@ p la@@ ying around ."
"But as so@@ on as they pas@@ sed by , it would start to clim@@ b up the w@@ all in j@@ er@@ k@@ y fa@@ shi@@ on ."
"And it would get ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ ed , and it would col@@ la@@ p@@ se every time ."
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ ic@@ ature of an up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down man .
"H@@ is head is so he@@ av@@ y , full of he@@ av@@ y thou@@ ghts , that it &apos;s sort of f@@ all@@ en into his h@@ at , and his body &apos;s gro@@ wn out of him almost like a plant ."
Well what he does is he mo@@ ves around in a very dru@@ n@@ k@@ en fa@@ shi@@ on on his head in a very un@@ predi@@ c@@ table and ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely s@@ low movement .
And it &apos;s kind of con@@ stra@@ ined by that cir@@ cle .
"Because if that cir@@ cle wer@@ en &apos;t there , and the flo@@ or was very even , it would start to wan@@ der about in the space ."
And there &apos;s no wi@@ res .
"So I &apos;ll just show you an in@@ stance — so when people ent@@ er the room , it activ@@ ates this ob@@ ject ."
"And it very slo@@ w@@ ly , over a few minutes , sort of pa@@ inf@@ ul@@ ly goes up , and then it ga@@ ins momen@@ tu@@ m and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to f@@ all ."
"And this is an important moment , because we wanted to inst@@ ill in the vi@@ e@@ wer an inst@@ in@@ ct to almost go and help , or s@@ ave the sub@@ ject ."
"But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ages to pul@@ l itself up ."
"So this work was a real tech@@ ni@@ cal chall@@ enge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the me@@ chan@@ ics right and the equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um and the dy@@ na@@ m@@ ics ."
"And it was very important for us to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh the ex@@ act moment that it would f@@ all , because if we made it in a way that it would to@@ p@@ ple over , then it would dam@@ age itself , and if it didn &apos;t f@@ all enough , it wouldn &apos;t inst@@ ill that f@@ at@@ al@@ ism , or that sense of wan@@ ting to go and help it ."
So I &apos;m going to show you a very qu@@ ick video where we are doing a test sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o — it &apos;s much f@@ aster .
That &apos;s my colle@@ ag@@ ue . He &apos;s let it go .
"Now he &apos;s getting ner@@ v@@ ous , so he &apos;s going to go cat@@ ch it ."
"But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ages to li@@ ft itself up on its own ."
"So this is a work that we were very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with , working with the a@@ es@@ th@@ et@@ ic of fu@@ r em@@ bed@@ ded with thousands of tiny different si@@ z@@ es of fi@@ ber op@@ ti@@ cs , which tw@@ in@@ k@@ le like the night sk@@ y ."
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sk@@ y .
"So we w@@ ra@@ pped this around a bl@@ ob@@ -@@ like form , which is in the sh@@ ape of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which was han@@ ging from the c@@ e@@ il@@ ing ."
"And the idea was to sort of con@@ tra@@ st something very c@@ old and dist@@ ant and ab@@ stra@@ ct like the universe into the famili@@ ar form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which is very com@@ for@@ ting and in@@ tim@@ ate ."
"And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar and you would almost perc@@ ei@@ ve it to be a h@@ ole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing night sk@@ y ."
"So this is the last work , and a work in progres@@ s , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ace F@@ ill@@ er . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you appro@@ ach@@ ed it , it tri@@ ed to in@@ tim@@ id@@ ate you by gro@@ wing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s tw@@ ice its he@@ ight and &#91; e@@ ight &#93; times its vol@@ u@@ me ."
And so this ob@@ ject is con@@ stan@@ tly ex@@ pan@@ ding and con@@ tra@@ c@@ ting to create a dy@@ na@@ mic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conc@@ e@@ al a se@@ cre@@ t within its se@@ am@@ s or something .
"So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gi@@ ves us a lot of pa@@ in in our work over years and years ."
But we use it because we &apos;re interest@@ ed in the way that it can help us to ex@@ pres@@ s the emot@@ i@@ ons and behavi@@ or@@ al patter@@ ns in these cre@@ at@@ ures that we create .
"And once a cre@@ ature po@@ ps into our min@@ ds , it &apos;s almost like the process of cre@@ ation is to disc@@ over the way this cre@@ ature really wan@@ ts to ex@@ ist and what form it wan@@ ts to take and what way it wan@@ ts to move ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m really gla@@ d to be here .
"I &apos;m gla@@ d you &apos;re here , because that would be a little we@@ ird ."
I &apos;m gla@@ d we &apos;re all here .
"And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here ."
O@@ r here .
But here .
I mean Earth .
"And by &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean those of us in this au@@ dit@@ ori@@ um , but life , all life on Earth — ( Laughter ) from complex to sing@@ le@@ -@@ cell@@ ed , from m@@ old to mu@@ sh@@ ro@@ om@@ s to fl@@ ying be@@ ar@@ s . ( Laughter )"
"The interesting thing is , Earth is the only place we know of that has life — 8@@ .@@ 7 million species ."
I@@ s Earth speci@@ al ?
"This is a question I &apos;ve wanted to know the answer to since I was a small child , and I su@@ spe@@ ct 80 percent of this au@@ dit@@ ori@@ um has thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer ."
"To understand whether there are any plan@@ ets — out there in our sol@@ ar system or be@@ y@@ ond — that can sup@@ port life , the first step is to understand what life here re@@ qui@@ res ."
"It turns out , of all of those 8@@ .@@ 7 million species , life only needs three things ."
"On one side , all life on Earth needs energy ."
"C@@ om@@ pl@@ ex life like us der@@ i@@ ves our energy from the su@@ n , but life de@@ ep under@@ ground can get its energy from things like chem@@ ical re@@ ac@@ tions ."
There are a number of different energy sour@@ ces av@@ ail@@ able on all plan@@ ets .
"On the other side , all life needs food or no@@ u@@ ri@@ sh@@ ment ."
"And this se@@ ems like a t@@ all order , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally if you want a su@@ c@@ cul@@ ent tom@@ a@@ to ."
"( Laughter ) H@@ ow@@ ever , all life on Earth der@@ i@@ ves its no@@ u@@ ri@@ sh@@ ment from only six chem@@ ical ele@@ ments , and these ele@@ ments can be found on any plan@@ et@@ ary body in our sol@@ ar system ."
"So that le@@ av@@ es the thing in the middle as the t@@ all po@@ le , the thing that &apos;s har@@ d@@ est to achi@@ eve ."
"N@@ ot mo@@ ose , but water ."
( Laughter ) Al@@ though mo@@ ose would be pretty co@@ ol . ( Laughter )
"And not f@@ ro@@ z@@ en water , and not water in a ga@@ se@@ ous state , but li@@ qu@@ id water ."
"This is what life needs to survi@@ ve , all life ."
"And many sol@@ ar system bod@@ ies don &apos;t have li@@ qu@@ id water , and so we don &apos;t look there ."
"O@@ ther sol@@ ar system bod@@ ies might have ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant li@@ qu@@ id water , even more than Earth , but it &apos;s tra@@ pped ben@@ e@@ ath an ic@@ y sh@@ ell , and so it &apos;s hard to acc@@ ess , it &apos;s hard to get to , it &apos;s hard to even find out if there &apos;s any life there ."
So that le@@ av@@ es a few bod@@ ies that we should think about .
So let &apos;s make the problem sim@@ pl@@ er for ourselves .
Let &apos;s think only about li@@ qu@@ id water on the surface of a planet .
"There are only three bod@@ ies to think about in our sol@@ ar system , with reg@@ ard to li@@ qu@@ id water on the surface of a planet , and in order of di@@ stance from the su@@ n , it &apos;s : V@@ en@@ us , Earth and Mar@@ s ."
You want to have an at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here for water to be li@@ qu@@ id .
You have to be very care@@ ful with that at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here .
"You can &apos;t have too much at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , too th@@ ick or too war@@ m an at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , because then you end up too ho@@ t like V@@ en@@ us , and you can &apos;t have li@@ qu@@ id water ."
"But if you have too little at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here and it &apos;s too th@@ in and too c@@ old , you end up like Mar@@ s , too c@@ old ."
"So V@@ en@@ us is too ho@@ t , Mar@@ s is too c@@ old , and Earth is just right ."
You can look at these images behind me and you can see au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally where life can survi@@ ve in our sol@@ ar system .
"It &apos;s a G@@ ol@@ d@@ il@@ oc@@ k@@ s@@ -@@ ty@@ pe problem , and it &apos;s so simple that a child could understand it ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , I &apos;d like to rem@@ ind you of two things from the G@@ ol@@ d@@ il@@ oc@@ ks story that we may not think about so often but that I think are really re@@ lev@@ ant here ."
"N@@ um@@ ber one : if M@@ am@@ a B@@ e@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too c@@ old when G@@ ol@@ d@@ il@@ oc@@ ks wal@@ ks into the room , does that mean it &apos;s always been too c@@ old ?"
O@@ r could it have been just right at some other time ?
Wh@@ en G@@ ol@@ d@@ il@@ oc@@ ks wal@@ ks into the room det@@ er@@ min@@ es the answer that we get in the story .
And the same is true with plan@@ ets .
They &apos;re not st@@ atic things . They change .
They v@@ ary . They evol@@ ve .
And at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ es do the same .
So let me give you an example .
Here &apos;s one of my fav@@ or@@ ite pic@@ tures of Mar@@ s .
"It &apos;s not the high@@ est re@@ solution image , it &apos;s not the se@@ x@@ i@@ est image , it &apos;s not the most rec@@ ent image , but it &apos;s an image that shows ri@@ ver@@ be@@ ds c@@ ut into the surface of the planet ; ri@@ ver@@ be@@ ds car@@ ved by flo@@ wing , li@@ qu@@ id water ; ri@@ ver@@ be@@ ds that take hun@@ dre@@ ds or thousands or ten@@ s of thousands of years to form ."
This can &apos;t happen on Mar@@ s today .
The at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here of Mar@@ s today is too th@@ in and too c@@ old for water to be st@@ able as a li@@ qu@@ id .
"This one image tel@@ ls you that the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here of Mar@@ s changed , and it changed in big ways ."
"And it changed from a state that we would def@@ ine as h@@ ab@@ it@@ able , because the three re@@ qui@@ remen@@ ts for life were present long ago ."
Wh@@ ere did that at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here go that allo@@ wed water to be li@@ qu@@ id at the surface ?
"Well , one idea is it es@@ cap@@ ed away to space ."
"A@@ t@@ mo@@ sp@@ h@@ eri@@ c parti@@ cl@@ es got enough energy to bre@@ ak free from the g@@ rav@@ ity of the planet , es@@ cap@@ ing away to space , never to re@@ turn ."
And this happens with all bod@@ ies with at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ es .
C@@ om@@ ets have ta@@ il@@ s that are incredi@@ bly vi@@ sible rem@@ in@@ ders of at@@ mo@@ sp@@ h@@ eri@@ c es@@ cap@@ e .
"But V@@ en@@ us also has an at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here that es@@ cap@@ es with time , and Mar@@ s and Earth as well ."
It &apos;s just a matter of de@@ gre@@ e and a matter of scale .
So we &apos;d like to figure out how much es@@ cap@@ ed over time so we can expla@@ in this trans@@ ition .
How do at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ es get their energy for es@@ cap@@ e ?
How do parti@@ cl@@ es get enough energy to es@@ cap@@ e ?
"There are two ways , if we &apos;re going to re@@ du@@ ce things a little bit ."
"N@@ um@@ ber one , su@@ n@@ light ."
L@@ ight em@@ it@@ ted from the su@@ n can be ab@@ sor@@ bed by at@@ mo@@ sp@@ h@@ eri@@ c parti@@ cl@@ es and war@@ m the parti@@ cl@@ es .
"@@ Y@@ es , I &apos;m dan@@ cing , but they — ( Laughter ) Oh my G@@ od , not even at my w@@ ed@@ ding . ( Laughter )"
They get enough energy to es@@ cap@@ e and bre@@ ak free from the g@@ rav@@ ity of the planet just by war@@ ming .
A second way they can get energy is from the sol@@ ar w@@ ind .
"Th@@ ese are parti@@ cl@@ es , mas@@ s , material , sp@@ it out from the surface of the su@@ n , and they go scre@@ am@@ ing through the sol@@ ar system at 4@@ 00 kilomet@@ ers per second , sometimes f@@ aster during sol@@ ar stor@@ ms , and they go h@@ ur@@ t@@ ling through inter@@ plan@@ et@@ ary space to@@ wards plan@@ ets and their at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ es , and they may pro@@ vide energy for at@@ mo@@ sp@@ h@@ eri@@ c parti@@ cl@@ es to es@@ cap@@ e as well ."
"This is something that I &apos;m interest@@ ed in , because it rel@@ ates to h@@ ab@@ it@@ ability ."
"I men@@ tion@@ ed that there were two things about the G@@ ol@@ d@@ il@@ oc@@ ks story that I wanted to bring to your atten@@ tion and rem@@ ind you about , and the second one is a little bit more sub@@ tle ."
"If P@@ ap@@ a B@@ e@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too ho@@ t , and M@@ am@@ a B@@ e@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too c@@ old , sh@@ ouldn &apos;t B@@ ab@@ y B@@ e@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l be even col@@ der if we &apos;re fol@@ lo@@ wing the tr@@ end ?"
"This thing that you &apos;ve acc@@ ep@@ ted your entire life , when you think about it a little bit more , may not be so simple ."
"And of course , di@@ stance of a planet from the su@@ n det@@ er@@ min@@ es its temper@@ ature ."
This has to play into h@@ ab@@ it@@ ability .
But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
"M@@ a@@ ybe it &apos;s the bo@@ w@@ ls themselves that are also hel@@ ping to det@@ er@@ m@@ ine the out@@ come in the story , what is just right ."
"I could talk to you about a lot of different charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of these three plan@@ ets that may inf@@ lu@@ ence h@@ ab@@ it@@ ability , but for sel@@ fish reas@@ ons rel@@ ated to my own research and the fact that I &apos;m standing up here hol@@ ding the c@@ lic@@ k@@ er and you &apos;re not — ( Laughter ) I would like to talk for just a minut@@ e or two about mag@@ net@@ ic fiel@@ ds ."
Earth has one ; V@@ en@@ us and Mar@@ s do not .
M@@ ag@@ net@@ ic fiel@@ ds are gener@@ ated in the de@@ ep inter@@ i@@ or of a planet by electri@@ cally con@@ duc@@ ting ch@@ ur@@ ning f@@ lu@@ id material that cre@@ ates this big old mag@@ net@@ ic fiel@@ d that sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ds Earth .
"If you have a comp@@ as@@ s , you know which way nor@@ th is ."
V@@ en@@ us and Mar@@ s don &apos;t have that .
"If you have a comp@@ as@@ s on V@@ en@@ us and Mar@@ s , con@@ g@@ rat@@ ul@@ ations , you &apos;re lost ."
( Laughter ) D@@ o@@ es this inf@@ lu@@ ence h@@ ab@@ it@@ ability ?
"Well , how might it ?"
"M@@ any scientists think that a mag@@ net@@ ic fiel@@ d of a planet ser@@ ves as a shi@@ el@@ d for the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , de@@ fle@@ c@@ ting sol@@ ar w@@ ind parti@@ cl@@ es around the planet in a bit of a for@@ ce fiel@@ d-@@ ty@@ pe eff@@ ect having to do with electri@@ c ch@@ ar@@ ge of those parti@@ cl@@ es ."
I like to think of it instead as a s@@ al@@ ad b@@ ar s@@ ne@@ ez@@ e gu@@ ard for plan@@ ets .
"O@@ K , so the eff@@ ect , then , is that Earth may have been prote@@ cted for bil@@ li@@ ons of years , because we &apos;ve had a mag@@ net@@ ic fiel@@ d ."
A@@ t@@ mo@@ sp@@ here h@@ asn &apos;t been able to es@@ cap@@ e .
"M@@ ar@@ s , on the other hand , has been un@@ prote@@ cted because of its l@@ ack of mag@@ net@@ ic fiel@@ d , and over bil@@ li@@ ons of years , maybe enough at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here has been stri@@ pped away to ac@@ coun@@ t for a trans@@ ition from a h@@ ab@@ it@@ able planet to the planet that we see today ."
"O@@ ther scientists think that mag@@ net@@ ic fiel@@ ds may act more like the sa@@ il@@ s on a ship , en@@ ab@@ ling the planet to inter@@ act with more energy from the sol@@ ar w@@ ind than the planet would have been able to inter@@ act with by itself ."
The sa@@ il@@ s may ga@@ ther energy from the sol@@ ar w@@ ind .
The mag@@ net@@ ic fiel@@ d may ga@@ ther energy from the sol@@ ar w@@ ind that allo@@ ws even more at@@ mo@@ sp@@ h@@ eri@@ c es@@ cap@@ e to happen .
"It &apos;s an idea that has to be test@@ ed , but the eff@@ ect and how it works se@@ ems ap@@ par@@ ent ."
That &apos;s because we know energy from the sol@@ ar w@@ ind is being de@@ pos@@ ited into our at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here here on Earth .
"That energy is con@@ duc@@ ted along mag@@ net@@ ic fiel@@ d lin@@ es down into the pol@@ ar regi@@ ons , resul@@ ting in incredi@@ bly beautiful au@@ ro@@ ra ."
"If you &apos;ve ever experi@@ en@@ ced them , it &apos;s mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent ."
We know the energy is getting in .
We &apos;re trying to meas@@ ure how many parti@@ cl@@ es are getting out and if the mag@@ net@@ ic fiel@@ d is inf@@ lu@@ en@@ cing this in any way .
"So I &apos;ve posed a problem for you here , but I don &apos;t have a solution yet ."
We don &apos;t have a solution .
But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
"Well , we &apos;ve s@@ ent sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft to all three plan@@ ets ."
"S@@ ome of them are or@@ b@@ iting now , inclu@@ ding the M@@ A@@ V@@ E@@ N sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft which is cur@@ r@@ ently or@@ b@@ iting Mar@@ s , which I &apos;m invol@@ ved with and which is led here , out of the Uni@@ vers@@ ity of C@@ ol@@ or@@ a@@ do ."
It &apos;s desig@@ ned to meas@@ ure at@@ mo@@ sp@@ h@@ eri@@ c es@@ cap@@ e .
We have si@@ mil@@ ar meas@@ u@@ remen@@ ts from V@@ en@@ us and Earth .
"O@@ n@@ ce we have all our meas@@ u@@ remen@@ ts , we can com@@ b@@ ine all these together , and we can understand how all three plan@@ ets inter@@ act with their space environment , with the sur@@ ro@@ un@@ din@@ gs ."
And we can deci@@ de whether mag@@ net@@ ic fiel@@ ds are important for h@@ ab@@ it@@ ability or not .
"O@@ n@@ ce we have that answer , why should you care ?"
"I mean , I care de@@ e@@ ply ..@@ ."
"And finan@@ ci@@ ally as well , but de@@ e@@ ply ."
"( Laughter ) F@@ i@@ rst of all , an answer to this question will te@@ ach us more about these three plan@@ ets , V@@ en@@ us , Earth and Mar@@ s , not only about how they inter@@ act with their environment today , but how they were bil@@ li@@ ons of years ago , whether they were h@@ ab@@ it@@ able long ago or not ."
It will te@@ ach us about at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ es that sur@@ round us and that are close .
"But mo@@ re@@ over , what we learn from these plan@@ ets can be app@@ li@@ ed to at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ es every@@ where , inclu@@ ding plan@@ ets that we &apos;re now ob@@ ser@@ ving around other star@@ s ."
"For example , the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft , which is built and contro@@ l@@ led here in B@@ ou@@ l@@ der , has been ob@@ ser@@ ving a post@@ age st@@ am@@ p@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed regi@@ on of the sk@@ y for a couple years now , and it &apos;s found thousands of plan@@ ets — in one post@@ age st@@ am@@ p@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed regi@@ on of the sk@@ y that we don &apos;t think is any different from any other part of the sk@@ y ."
"We &apos;ve gone , in 20 years , from kno@@ wing of zer@@ o plan@@ ets outside of our sol@@ ar system , to now having so many , that we don &apos;t know which ones to invest@@ ig@@ ate first ."
A@@ ny le@@ ver will help .
"In fact , based on ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ations that K@@ e@@ pl@@ er &apos;s taken and other si@@ mil@@ ar ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ations , we now believe that , of the 2@@ 00 billion star@@ s in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay gal@@ a@@ x@@ y alone , on aver@@ age , every st@@ ar has at least one planet ."
"In add@@ ition to that , est@@ im@@ ates su@@ gg@@ est there are some@@ where between 40 billion and 100 billion of those plan@@ ets that we would def@@ ine as h@@ ab@@ it@@ able in just our gal@@ a@@ x@@ y ."
"We have the ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ations of those plan@@ ets , but we just don &apos;t know which ones are h@@ ab@@ it@@ able yet ."
"It &apos;s a little bit like being tra@@ pped on a red spo@@ t — ( Laughter ) on a stage and kno@@ wing that there are other wor@@ l@@ ds out there and des@@ per@@ ately wan@@ ting to know more about them , wan@@ ting to inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them are a little bit like you ."
"You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet ."
"And so you have to use the to@@ ols that you &apos;ve develop@@ ed around you for V@@ en@@ us , Earth and Mar@@ s , and you have to ap@@ ply them to these other situ@@ ations , and hope that you &apos;re making reas@@ on@@ able in@@ fer@@ ences from the data , and that you &apos;re going to be able to det@@ er@@ m@@ ine the best can@@ di@@ dat@@ es for h@@ ab@@ it@@ able plan@@ ets , and those that are not ."
"In the end , and for now , at least , this is our red spo@@ t , right here ."
"This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s h@@ ab@@ it@@ able , al@@ though very so@@ on we may come to know of more ."
"But for now , this is the only h@@ ab@@ it@@ able planet , and this is our red spo@@ t ."
I &apos;m really gla@@ d we &apos;re here .
Th@@ an@@ ks .
( Applause )
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Th@@ in@@ k about everything it has b@@ rou@@ ght us .
"Th@@ in@@ k about all the ser@@ vi@@ ces we use , all the conne@@ c@@ tiv@@ ity , all the en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , all the business , all the com@@ mer@@ ce ."
And it &apos;s happening during our li@@ f@@ et@@ imes .
"I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writ@@ ing history bo@@ oks hun@@ dre@@ ds of years from now . This time our gener@@ ation will be rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed as the gener@@ ation that got on@@ line , the gener@@ ation that built something really and tru@@ ly global ."
"But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very seri@@ ous problems , problems with se@@ cur@@ ity and problems with priv@@ ac@@ y ."
I &apos;ve sp@@ ent my care@@ er fi@@ gh@@ ting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is B@@ ra@@ in .
This is a flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k — five and a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ ch flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k inf@@ ec@@ ted by B@@ ra@@ in@@ .@@ A@@ .
It &apos;s the first viru@@ s we ever found for P@@ C compu@@ ters .
And we actually know where B@@ ra@@ in came from .
We know because it says so inside the c@@ ode .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
"That &apos;s the bo@@ ot sec@@ tor of an inf@@ ec@@ ted flo@@ pp@@ y , and if we take a clo@@ s@@ er look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to the du@@ n@@ ge@@ on . &quot; &quot; And then it contin@@ ues , saying , 19@@ 8@@ 6 , B@@ a@@ sit and A@@ m@@ ja@@ d ."
"And B@@ a@@ sit and A@@ m@@ ja@@ d are first na@@ m@@ es , P@@ a@@ ki@@ stan@@ i first na@@ m@@ es ."
"In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an add@@ ress in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) Now , 19@@ 8@@ 6 ."
Now it &apos;s 20@@ 11 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The P@@ C viru@@ s problem is 25 years old now .
"So half a year ago , I decided to go to P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an myself ."
"So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of ph@@ ot@@ os I took while I was in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"This is from the city of L@@ a@@ h@@ ore , which is around 3@@ 00 kilomet@@ ers s@@ outh from A@@ b@@ bot@@ ta@@ bad , where B@@ in L@@ ad@@ en was cau@@ ght ."
Here &apos;s a ty@@ p@@ ical stre@@ et view .
"And here &apos;s the stre@@ et or ro@@ ad le@@ ad@@ ing to this building , which is 7@@ 30 N@@ iz@@ am blo@@ ck at Al@@ l@@ am@@ a I@@ q@@ b@@ al T@@ own ."
And I kno@@ c@@ ked on the do@@ or .
( Laughter ) You want to gu@@ ess who op@@ en@@ ed the do@@ or ?
B@@ a@@ sit and A@@ m@@ ja@@ d ; they are still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is B@@ a@@ sit .
S@@ it@@ ting down is his bro@@ ther A@@ m@@ ja@@ d .
These are the guys who w@@ ro@@ te the first P@@ C viru@@ s .
"Now of course , we had a very interesting disc@@ us@@ sion ."
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion from learning that both B@@ a@@ sit and A@@ m@@ ja@@ d had had their compu@@ ters inf@@ ec@@ ted do@@ z@@ ens of times by completely un@@ rel@@ ated other viru@@ ses over these years .
So there is some sort of ju@@ st@@ ice in the world after all .
"Now , the viru@@ ses that we used to see in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s and 199@@ 0s obvi@@ ously are not a problem any more ."
So let me just show you a couple of exam@@ ples of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m ru@@ n@@ ning here is a system that en@@ ab@@ les me to run ag@@ e-@@ old progra@@ ms on a mo@@ der@@ n computer .
So let me just m@@ oun@@ t some dri@@ ves . G@@ o over there .
What we have here is a li@@ st of old viru@@ ses .
So let me just run some viru@@ ses on my computer .
"For example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de viru@@ s first ."
"And you can see at the top of the scre@@ en , there &apos;s a c@@ enti@@ pe@@ de sc@@ ro@@ l@@ ling across your computer when you get inf@@ ec@@ ted by this one ."
You know that you &apos;re inf@@ ec@@ ted because it actually shows up .
"H@@ ere &apos;s another one . This is the viru@@ s called C@@ ras@@ h , inv@@ ented in R@@ us@@ si@@ a in 199@@ 2 ."
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
"( S@@ i@@ re@@ n no@@ ise ) And the last example , gu@@ ess what the W@@ al@@ k@@ er viru@@ s does ?"
"@@ Y@@ es , there &apos;s a guy wal@@ king across your scre@@ en once you get inf@@ ec@@ ted ."
"So it used to be fa@@ ir@@ ly easy to know that you &apos;re inf@@ ec@@ ted by a viru@@ s , when the viru@@ ses were writ@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ by@@ ist@@ s and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ oday , they are no longer being writ@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ by@@ ist@@ s and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ oday , viru@@ ses are a global problem ."
"What we have here in the back@@ ground is an example of our systems that we run in our lab@@ s , where we tra@@ ck viru@@ s inf@@ ec@@ tions wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blo@@ c@@ ked viru@@ ses in S@@ w@@ ed@@ en and Ta@@ i@@ w@@ an and R@@ us@@ si@@ a and el@@ se@@ where .
"In fact , if I just conne@@ ct back to our la@@ b systems through the W@@ e@@ b , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viru@@ ses , how many new exam@@ ples of mal@@ w@@ are we find every single day ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s the l@@ at@@ est viru@@ s we &apos;ve found , in a f@@ ile called S@@ er@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e@@ ."
"And we found it right over here three secon@@ ds ago — the pre@@ vi@@ ous one , six secon@@ ds ago ."
"And if we just sc@@ ro@@ ll around , it &apos;s just mas@@ sive ."
"We find ten@@ s of thousands , even hun@@ dre@@ ds of thousands ."
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of mal@@ w@@ are every single day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
"Well today , it &apos;s the organiz@@ ed cri@@ min@@ al gan@@ gs writ@@ ing these viru@@ ses because they make money with their viru@@ ses ."
It &apos;s gan@@ gs like — let &apos;s go to G@@ ang@@ sta@@ B@@ u@@ ck@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
This is a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite oper@@ ating in M@@ os@@ c@@ ow where these guys are bu@@ ying inf@@ ec@@ ted compu@@ ters .
"So if you are a viru@@ s writ@@ er and you &apos;re cap@@ able of inf@@ ec@@ ting W@@ in@@ do@@ ws compu@@ ters , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can s@@ ell those inf@@ ec@@ ted compu@@ ters — somebody else &apos;s compu@@ ters — to these guys ."
And they &apos;ll actually p@@ ay you money for those compu@@ ters .
So how do these guys then mon@@ et@@ ize those inf@@ ec@@ ted compu@@ ters ?
"Well there &apos;s mul@@ ti@@ ple different ways , such as ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your on@@ line ban@@ king ac@@ coun@@ ts when you do on@@ line ban@@ king , or ke@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers ."
"K@@ e@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers sil@@ ently sit on your computer , h@@ id@@ den from view , and they recor@@ d everything you ty@@ pe ."
So you &apos;re sit@@ ting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google sear@@ ch@@ es .
E@@ very single Google sear@@ ch you ty@@ pe is sav@@ ed and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
E@@ very single em@@ a@@ il you write is sav@@ ed and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
S@@ ame thing with every single pas@@ s@@ word and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are s@@ es@@ sions where you go on@@ line and do on@@ line pur@@ chas@@ es in any on@@ line st@@ ore .
"Because when you do pur@@ chas@@ es in on@@ line sto@@ res , you will be ty@@ ping in your name , the deli@@ very add@@ ress , your cre@@ dit c@@ ard number and the cre@@ dit c@@ ard se@@ cur@@ ity c@@ od@@ es ."
And here &apos;s an example of a f@@ ile we found from a ser@@ ver a couple of we@@ eks ago .
"That &apos;s the cre@@ dit c@@ ard number , that &apos;s the ex@@ pi@@ r@@ ation d@@ ate , that &apos;s the se@@ cur@@ ity c@@ ode , and that &apos;s the name of the ow@@ ner of the c@@ ard ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you ga@@ in acc@@ ess to other people &apos;s cre@@ dit c@@ ard information , you can just go on@@ line and bu@@ y what@@ ever you want with this information ."
"And that , obvi@@ ously , is a problem ."
We now have a whole under@@ ground mark@@ et@@ place and business ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em built around on@@ line cri@@ me .
One example of how these guys actually are cap@@ able of mon@@ et@@ iz@@ ing their oper@@ ations : we go and have a look at the p@@ ages of I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L and sear@@ ch for wanted pers@@ ons .
"We find guys like B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ d@@ in , orig@@ in@@ ally from S@@ w@@ ed@@ en , and his part@@ ner in cri@@ me , also list@@ ed on the I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L wanted p@@ ages , M@@ r@@ . S@@ ha@@ il@@ e@@ sh@@ ku@@ ma@@ r J@@ a@@ in , a U.@@ S. c@@ it@@ iz@@ en ."
"Th@@ ese guys were ru@@ n@@ ning an oper@@ ation called I@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ U@@ . , a cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me oper@@ ation through which they net@@ ted milli@@ ons ."
They are both right now on the run .
N@@ ob@@ ody kno@@ ws where they are .
"U@@ .@@ S. off@@ ici@@ als , just a couple of we@@ eks ago , f@@ ro@@ ze a S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t bel@@ on@@ ging to M@@ r@@ . J@@ a@@ in , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.@@ S. dollars on it ."
So the amount of money on@@ line cri@@ me gener@@ ates is sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant .
And that means that the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als can actually af@@ for@@ d to inv@@ est into their atta@@ cks .
"We know that on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are h@@ ir@@ ing program@@ mer@@ s , h@@ ir@@ ing test@@ ing people , test@@ ing their c@@ ode , having back@@ -@@ end systems with S@@ Q@@ L dat@@ ab@@ ases ."
And they can af@@ for@@ d to wat@@ ch how we work — like how se@@ cur@@ ity people work — and try to work their way around any se@@ cur@@ ity pre@@ cau@@ tions we can build .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their adv@@ anta@@ ge .
"I mean , the Internet is inter@@ national ."
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
"And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the on@@ line world , here &apos;s a video built by C@@ l@@ ari@@ fi@@ ed N@@ et@@ works , which il@@ lu@@ strat@@ es how one single mal@@ w@@ are family is able to move around the world ."
"This oper@@ ation , beli@@ ev@@ ed to be orig@@ in@@ ally from E@@ st@@ on@@ ia , mo@@ ves around from one country to another as so@@ on as the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite is tri@@ ed to sh@@ ut down ."
So you just can &apos;t sh@@ ut these guys down .
"They will sw@@ it@@ ch from one country to another , from one ju@@ ris@@ di@@ ction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability to glob@@ ally poli@@ ce oper@@ ations like this ."
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plan@@ e ti@@ ck@@ ets to all the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als of the world .
"Now , cri@@ min@@ als who wer@@ en &apos;t cap@@ able of re@@ ach@@ ing us before can re@@ ach us ."
So how do you actually go around fin@@ ding on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als ?
How do you actually tra@@ ck them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one ex@@ plo@@ it f@@ ile .
"H@@ ere , I &apos;m looking at the H@@ ex dum@@ p of an image f@@ ile , which con@@ ta@@ ins an ex@@ plo@@ it ."
"And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image f@@ ile on your W@@ in@@ do@@ ws computer , it actually takes over your computer and ru@@ ns c@@ ode ."
"Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image f@@ ile — well there &apos;s the image he@@ ad@@ er , and there the ac@@ tual c@@ ode of the atta@@ ck star@@ ts ."
"And that c@@ ode has been en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted , so let &apos;s dec@@ ry@@ pt it ."
It has been en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted with X@@ O@@ R fun@@ ction 9@@ 7 .
"You just have to believe me , it is , it is ."
And we can go here and actually start dec@@ ry@@ p@@ ting it .
Well the y@@ el@@ low part of the c@@ ode is now dec@@ ry@@ p@@ ted .
"And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the orig@@ in@@ al ."
But just keep star@@ ing at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a W@@ e@@ b add@@ ress : uni@@ on@@ se@@ ek@@ .@@ c@@ om / d / i@@ o@@ o@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad and run that progra@@ m .
And that &apos;s a back@@ do@@ or which will take over your computer .
"But even more interest@@ ing@@ ly , if we contin@@ ue dec@@ ry@@ p@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous str@@ ing , which says O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
That c@@ ode is there under@@ ne@@ ath the en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ tion as some sort of a sig@@ nature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
"And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means ."
So obvi@@ ously I Goog@@ led for it .
I got zer@@ o h@@ its ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I spo@@ ke with the guys at the la@@ b .
"And we have a couple of R@@ us@@ si@@ an guys in our lab@@ s , and one of them men@@ tion@@ ed , well , it ends in R@@ U@@ S like R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
And 7@@ 8 is the city c@@ ode for the city of S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
"For example , you can find it from some phone num@@ bers and car lic@@ en@@ se plat@@ es and stuff like that ."
"So I went looking for con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts in S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g , and through a long ro@@ ad , we ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally found this one particular we@@ b@@ s@@ ite ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s this R@@ us@@ si@@ an guy who &apos;s been oper@@ ating on@@ line for a number of years who ru@@ ns his own we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , and he ru@@ ns a blo@@ g under the popul@@ ar Li@@ ve J@@ our@@ nal ."
"And on this blo@@ g , he blo@@ gs about his life , about his life in S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g — he &apos;s in his early 20@@ s — about his c@@ at , about his gir@@ l@@ friend ."
And he dri@@ ves a very ni@@ ce car .
"In fact , this guy dri@@ ves a M@@ er@@ c@@ ed@@ es@@ -@@ B@@ en@@ z S@@ 6@@ 00 V@@ 12 with a si@@ x@@ -@@ lit@@ er eng@@ ine with more than 4@@ 00 hor@@ se@@ power ."
Now that &apos;s a ni@@ ce car for a 20@@ -@@ something year@@ -@@ old ki@@ d in S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he blo@@ gg@@ ed about the car .
He actually had a car ac@@ ci@@ dent .
"In do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g , he actually cra@@ shed his car into another car ."
And he put blo@@ gg@@ ed images about the car ac@@ ci@@ dent — that &apos;s his M@@ er@@ c@@ ed@@ es — right here is the L@@ a@@ da S@@ am@@ ar@@ a he cra@@ shed into .
And you can actually see that the lic@@ en@@ se pl@@ ate of the S@@ am@@ ar@@ a ends in 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S .
"And if you actually take a look at the sc@@ en@@ e picture , you can see that the pl@@ ate of the M@@ er@@ c@@ ed@@ es is O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
"Now I &apos;m not a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I re@@ st my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are cau@@ ght ?"
Well in most c@@ ases it never gets this far .
"The v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of the on@@ line cri@@ me c@@ ases , we don &apos;t even know which contin@@ ent the atta@@ cks are coming from ."
"And even if we are able to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als , quite often there is no out@@ come ."
"The local poli@@ ce don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evid@@ ence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down ."
I w@@ ish it would be e@@ a@@ si@@ er ; un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately it isn &apos;t .
But things are also chang@@ ing at a very ra@@ p@@ id p@@ ace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like S@@ tu@@ x@@ net .
So if you look at what S@@ tu@@ x@@ net did is that it inf@@ ec@@ ted these .
"That &apos;s a S@@ i@@ e@@ men@@ s S@@ 7@@ -@@ 4@@ 00 P@@ L@@ C , program@@ m@@ able lo@@ gic &#91; contro@@ l@@ l@@ er &#93; ."
And this is what ru@@ ns our infra@@ structure .
This is what ru@@ ns everything around us .
"P@@ L@@ C &apos;s , these small bo@@ x@@ es which have no dis@@ play , no ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard , which are program@@ med , are put in place , and they do their job ."
"For example , the el@@ ev@@ at@@ ors in this building most lik@@ ely are contro@@ l@@ led by one of these ."
"And when S@@ tu@@ x@@ net inf@@ ec@@ ts one of these , that &apos;s a mas@@ sive revol@@ ution on the kinds of ri@@ sk@@ s we have to wor@@ ry about ."
Because everything around us is being run by these .
"I mean , we have c@@ rit@@ ical infra@@ structure ."
"You go to any fac@@ tory , any power plant , any chem@@ ical plant , any food proc@@ ess@@ ing plant , you look around — everything is being run by compu@@ ters ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing is being run by compu@@ ters .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing is reli@@ ant on these compu@@ ters working .
"We have become very reli@@ ant on Internet , on ba@@ sic things like electri@@ city , obvi@@ ously , on compu@@ ters working ."
And this really is something which cre@@ ates completely new problems for us .
We must have some way of contin@@ u@@ ing to work even if compu@@ ters fa@@ il .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So pre@@ pa@@ red@@ ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for gran@@ ted are@@ n &apos;t there .
"It &apos;s actually very ba@@ sic stuff — thinking about contin@@ u@@ ity , thinking about bac@@ ku@@ ps , thinking about the things that actually matter ."
Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
Th@@ in@@ k about all the ser@@ vi@@ ces we have on@@ line .
"Th@@ in@@ k about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another ."
"I see beau@@ ty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we might not see that ."
I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we are ru@@ n@@ ning into problems because of on@@ line cri@@ me .
O@@ n@@ line cri@@ me is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;ve sp@@ ent my life def@@ en@@ ding the Net , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fi@@ ght on@@ line cri@@ me , we are ru@@ n@@ ning a risk of lo@@ sing it all ."
"We have to do this glob@@ ally , and we have to do it right now ."
"What we need is more global , inter@@ national la@@ w en@@ for@@ c@@ ement work to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ al gan@@ gs — these organiz@@ ed gan@@ gs that are making milli@@ ons out of their atta@@ cks ."
That &apos;s much more important than ru@@ n@@ ning anti@@ -@@ viru@@ ses or ru@@ n@@ ning fi@@ re@@ w@@ all@@ s .
"What actually mat@@ ters is actually fin@@ ding the people behind these atta@@ cks , and even more import@@ an@@ tly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this on@@ line world of cri@@ me , but hav@@ en &apos;t yet done it ."
"We have to find the people with the sk@@ ill@@ s , but without the opport@@ unities and give them the opport@@ unities to use their sk@@ ill@@ s for good ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is chang@@ ing with really rem@@ ar@@ ka@@ ble spe@@ ed .
"If you look at the ch@@ art at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 20@@ 25 , these G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s pro@@ jec@@ tions su@@ gg@@ est that the Ch@@ in@@ ese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
"And if you look at the ch@@ art for 20@@ 50 , it &apos;s pro@@ jec@@ ted that the Ch@@ in@@ ese economy will be tw@@ ice the size of the American economy , and the Indi@@ an economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
And we should be@@ ar in mind here that these pro@@ jec@@ tions were dra@@ wn up before the W@@ ester@@ n finan@@ cial cri@@ s@@ is .
"A couple of we@@ eks ago , I was looking at the l@@ at@@ est pro@@ jec@@ tion by B@@ N@@ P P@@ ari@@ b@@ as for when China will have a lar@@ ger economy than the United States ."
G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s pro@@ jec@@ ted 20@@ 2@@ 7 .
The post@@ -@@ cri@@ s@@ is pro@@ jec@@ tion is 20@@ 20 .
That &apos;s just a de@@ ca@@ de away .
China is going to change the world in two fundam@@ en@@ tal re@@ spe@@ c@@ ts .
"F@@ i@@ rst of all , it &apos;s a huge develop@@ ing country with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people , which has been gro@@ wing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year ."
"And within a de@@ ca@@ de , it will have the lar@@ g@@ est economy in the world ."
"N@@ ever before in the mo@@ der@@ n era has the lar@@ g@@ est economy in the world been that of a develop@@ ing country , rather than a develop@@ ed country ."
"Se@@ con@@ dly , for the first time in the mo@@ der@@ n era , the dom@@ in@@ ant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the W@@ est and from very , very different ci@@ viliz@@ ational ro@@ ots ."
"Now , I know it &apos;s a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion in the W@@ est that as countries mo@@ der@@ niz@@ e , they also w@@ est@@ ern@@ ize ."
This is an il@@ lu@@ sion .
"It &apos;s an as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion that mo@@ der@@ n@@ ity is a produc@@ t simply of comp@@ et@@ ition , mark@@ ets and technology ."
It is not . It is also sh@@ ap@@ ed equ@@ ally by history and culture .
"Ch@@ ina is not like the W@@ est , and it will not become like the W@@ est ."
It will re@@ ma@@ in in very fundam@@ en@@ tal re@@ spe@@ c@@ ts very different .
"Now the big question here is obvi@@ ously , how do we make sense of China ?"
How do we try to understand what China is ?
"And the problem we have in the W@@ est at the moment , by and large , is that the con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal appro@@ ach is that we understand it really in W@@ ester@@ n terms , using W@@ ester@@ n ideas ."
We can &apos;t .
"Now I want to off@@ er you three building blo@@ cks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning ."
The first is this : that China is not really a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
"O@@ kay , it &apos;s called itself a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state for the last hun@@ d@@ red years , but everyone who kno@@ ws anything about China kno@@ ws it &apos;s a lot ol@@ der than this ."
This was what China looked like with the vi@@ c@@ tory of the Q@@ in D@@ y@@ na@@ st@@ y in 2@@ 2@@ 1 B@@ .@@ C@@ . at the end of the war@@ r@@ ing@@ -@@ state period — the bir@@ th of mo@@ der@@ n China .
And you can see it against the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es of mo@@ der@@ n China .
"O@@ r im@@ medi@@ ately af@@ ter@@ ward , the H@@ an D@@ y@@ na@@ st@@ y , still 2@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And you can see already it oc@@ cu@@ pi@@ es most of what we now know as E@@ ast@@ er@@ n China , which is where the v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of Ch@@ in@@ ese li@@ ved then and live now ."
"Now what is extra@@ ordin@@ ary about this is , what gi@@ ves China its sense of being China , what gi@@ ves the Ch@@ in@@ ese the sense of what it is to be Ch@@ in@@ ese , comes not from the last hun@@ d@@ red years , not from the n@@ ation@@ -@@ state period , which is what happened in the W@@ est , but from the period , if you like , of the ci@@ viliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
"I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of cu@@ st@@ om@@ s like an@@ c@@ est@@ ral wor@@ ship , of a very dist@@ in@@ ctive not@@ ion of the state , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , a very dist@@ in@@ ctive not@@ ion of the family , social relation@@ shi@@ ps like gu@@ an@@ x@@ i , Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an val@@ ues and so on ."
These are all things that come from the period of the ci@@ viliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
"In other words , China , un@@ like the W@@ ester@@ n stat@@ es and most countries in the world , is sh@@ ap@@ ed by its sense of ci@@ viliz@@ ation , its exist@@ ence as a ci@@ viliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , rather than as a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
"And there &apos;s one other thing to ad@@ d to this , and that is this : O@@ f course we know China &apos;s big , huge , de@@ mog@@ ra@@ ph@@ ically and ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ically , with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people ."
"What we often are@@ n &apos;t really aw@@ are of is the fact that China is ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely di@@ ver@@ se and very pl@@ ur@@ al@@ ist@@ ic , and in many ways very de@@ cent@@ r@@ aliz@@ ed ."
"You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , even though we think this to be the case ."
It &apos;s never been the case .
"So this is China , a ci@@ viliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , rather than a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think it has all sor@@ ts of pro@@ found imp@@ lic@@ ations ."
I &apos;ll give you two qu@@ ick ones .
"The first is that the most important polit@@ ical val@@ ue for the Ch@@ in@@ ese is unity , is the ma@@ in@@ ten@@ ance of Ch@@ in@@ ese ci@@ viliz@@ ation ."
"You know , 2@@ ,000 years ago , Euro@@ pe : bre@@ ak@@ down — the fra@@ g@@ men@@ t@@ ation of the H@@ ol@@ y R@@ om@@ an E@@ m@@ pi@@ re ."
"It di@@ vid@@ ed , and it &apos;s re@@ ma@@ ined di@@ vid@@ ed ever since ."
"Ch@@ ina , over the same time period , went in exactly the op@@ pos@@ ite direc@@ tion , very pa@@ inf@@ ul@@ ly hol@@ ding this huge ci@@ viliz@@ ation , ci@@ viliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , together ."
"The second is maybe more pro@@ sa@@ ic , which is H@@ ong K@@ ong ."
Do you remember the han@@ dov@@ er of H@@ ong K@@ ong by B@@ rit@@ a@@ in to China in 199@@ 7 ?
You may remember what the Ch@@ in@@ ese con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ onal pro@@ pos@@ ition was .
"One country , two systems ."
And I &apos;ll la@@ y a w@@ ag@@ er that b@@ are@@ ly any@@ one in the W@@ est beli@@ ev@@ ed them .
&quot; &quot; W@@ in@@ do@@ w d@@ res@@ sing .
"When China gets its hands on H@@ ong K@@ ong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ir@@ te@@ en years on , the polit@@ ical and leg@@ al system in H@@ ong K@@ ong is as different now as it was in 199@@ 7 ."
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
"We were wrong because we thought , nat@@ ur@@ ally enough , in n@@ ation@@ -@@ state ways ."
"Th@@ in@@ k of Ger@@ man uni@@ fic@@ ation , 199@@ 0 ."
What happened ?
"Well , basically the E@@ ast was s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed by the W@@ est ."
"One n@@ ation , one system ."
That is the n@@ ation@@ -@@ state men@@ tal@@ ity .
"But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a ci@@ viliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , on the bas@@ is of one ci@@ viliz@@ ation , one system ."
It doesn &apos;t work .
"So actually the respon@@ se of China to the question of H@@ ong K@@ ong — as it will be to the question of Ta@@ i@@ w@@ an — was a natural respon@@ se : one ci@@ viliz@@ ation , many systems ."
Let me off@@ er you another building blo@@ ck to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a com@@ for@@ table one .
"The Ch@@ in@@ ese have a very , very different conc@@ ep@@ tion of ra@@ ce to most other countries ."
"D@@ o you know , of the 1@@ .@@ 3 billion Ch@@ in@@ ese , over 9@@ 0 percent of them think they bel@@ ong to the same ra@@ ce , the H@@ an ?"
"Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most popul@@ ous countries ."
"In@@ di@@ a , the United States , In@@ don@@ es@@ ia , B@@ raz@@ il — all of them are mul@@ ti@@ ra@@ cial ."
The Ch@@ in@@ ese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only mul@@ ti@@ ra@@ cial really at the mar@@ g@@ ins .
"So the question is , why ?"
"Well the reason , I think , es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally is , again , back to the ci@@ viliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
"A history of at least 2@@ ,000 years , a history of con@@ qu@@ est , oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ation , ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion , as@@ si@@ mil@@ ation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this not@@ ion of the H@@ an em@@ er@@ g@@ ed — of course , n@@ ur@@ tu@@ red by a gro@@ wing and very powerful sense of cul@@ tu@@ ral id@@ ent@@ ity ."
"Now the great adv@@ anta@@ ge of this hist@@ or@@ ical experience has been that , without the H@@ an , China could never have hel@@ d together ."
The H@@ an id@@ ent@@ ity has been the c@@ ement which has hel@@ d this country together .
The great dis@@ adv@@ anta@@ ge of it is that the H@@ an have a very we@@ ak conc@@ ep@@ tion of cul@@ tu@@ ral difference .
"They really believe in their own su@@ peri@@ or@@ ity , and they are dis@@ re@@ spe@@ c@@ t@@ ful of those who are not ."
"H@@ ence their at@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de , for example , to the U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur@@ s and to the T@@ i@@ bet@@ ans ."
"O@@ r let me give you my third building blo@@ ck , the Ch@@ in@@ ese state ."
Now the relation@@ ship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the W@@ est .
Now we in the W@@ est over@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly se@@ em to think — in these days at least — that the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and leg@@ it@@ im@@ ac@@ y of the state is a fun@@ ction of demo@@ cra@@ cy .
The problem with this pro@@ pos@@ ition is that the Ch@@ in@@ ese state en@@ jo@@ ys more leg@@ it@@ im@@ ac@@ y and more au@@ th@@ or@@ ity am@@ on@@ g@@ st the Ch@@ in@@ ese than is true with any W@@ ester@@ n state .
"And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reas@@ ons , I think ."
"And it &apos;s obvi@@ ously got nothing to do with demo@@ cra@@ cy , because in our terms the Ch@@ in@@ ese cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t have a demo@@ cra@@ cy ."
"And the reason for this is , fi@@ r@@ st@@ ly , because the state in China is given a very speci@@ al — it en@@ jo@@ ys a very speci@@ al sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance as the re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative , the em@@ bod@@ im@@ ent and the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an of Ch@@ in@@ ese ci@@ viliz@@ ation , of the ci@@ viliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
This is as close as China gets to a kind of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual ro@@ le .
"And the second reason is because , wh@@ ere@@ as in Euro@@ pe and Nor@@ th America , the state &apos;s power is contin@@ u@@ ously chall@@ eng@@ ed — I mean in the Euro@@ pe@@ an trad@@ ition , hist@@ or@@ ically against the ch@@ ur@@ ch , against other sec@@ tors of the ari@@ sto@@ cra@@ cy , against mer@@ chan@@ ts and so on — for 1@@ ,000 years , the power of the Ch@@ in@@ ese state has not been chall@@ eng@@ ed ."
It &apos;s had no seri@@ ous ri@@ v@@ als .
So you can see that the way in which power has been con@@ stru@@ cted in China is very different from our experience in W@@ ester@@ n history .
"The resul@@ t , by the way , is that the Ch@@ in@@ ese have a very different view of the state ."
"Wh@@ ere@@ as we t@@ end to view it as an in@@ tru@@ der , a stran@@ ger , cer@@ tain@@ ly an org@@ an wh@@ ose po@@ wers need to be lim@@ ited or de@@ fin@@ ed and con@@ stra@@ ined , the Ch@@ in@@ ese don &apos;t see the state like that at all ."
"The Ch@@ in@@ ese view the state as an in@@ tim@@ ate — not just as an in@@ tim@@ ate actually , as a mem@@ ber of the family — not just in fact as a mem@@ ber of the family , but as the head of the family , the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch of the family ."
"This is the Ch@@ in@@ ese view of the state — very , very different to ours ."
It &apos;s em@@ bed@@ ded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the W@@ est .
"And I would su@@ gg@@ est to you that actually what we are de@@ al@@ ing with here , in the Ch@@ in@@ ese con@@ text , is a new kind of pa@@ radi@@ g@@ m , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past ."
K@@ now that China beli@@ ev@@ es in the market and the state .
"I mean , A@@ da@@ m S@@ m@@ ith , already writ@@ ing in the l@@ ate 1@@ 8@@ th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Ch@@ in@@ ese market is lar@@ ger and more develop@@ ed and more so@@ ph@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated than anything in Euro@@ pe . &quot; &quot; And , a@@ part from the Ma@@ o period , that has re@@ ma@@ ined more or less the case ever since ."
But this is com@@ b@@ ined with an ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely stron@@ g and ubi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous state .
The state is every@@ where in China .
"I mean , it &apos;s le@@ ad@@ ing fi@@ r@@ ms — many of them are still publi@@ c@@ ly ow@@ ned ."
"P@@ ri@@ v@@ ate fi@@ r@@ ms , ho@@ w@@ ever large they are , like L@@ en@@ ov@@ o , de@@ p@@ end in many ways on state pat@@ ro@@ na@@ ge ."
T@@ ar@@ gets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
"And the state , of course , its au@@ th@@ or@@ ity flo@@ ws into lots of other are@@ as — as we are famili@@ ar with — with something like the on@@ e-@@ child po@@ lic@@ y ."
"Mo@@ re@@ over , this is a very old state trad@@ ition , a very old trad@@ ition of stat@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft ."
"I mean , if you want an il@@ lu@@ str@@ ation of this , the Gre@@ at W@@ all is one ."
"But this is another , this is the G@@ r@@ and C@@ an@@ al , which was con@@ stru@@ cted in the first in@@ stance in the fi@@ f@@ th century B@@ .@@ C@@ ."
and was finally complet@@ ed in the se@@ v@@ ent@@ h century A@@ .@@ D@@ .
"It went for 1@@ ,@@ 1@@ 1@@ 4 mil@@ es , lin@@ king B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing with H@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou and Sh@@ an@@ gh@@ a@@ i ."
"So there &apos;s a long history of extra@@ ordin@@ ary state infra@@ struc@@ tu@@ ral pro@@ jects in China , which I sup@@ pose hel@@ ps us to expla@@ in what we see today , which is something like the Th@@ ree G@@ org@@ es D@@ am and many other ex@@ pres@@ sions of state comp@@ et@@ ence within China ."
"So there we have three building blo@@ cks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the ci@@ viliz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , the not@@ ion of ra@@ ce and the nature of the state and its relation@@ ship to society ."
"And yet we still in@@ si@@ st , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply dra@@ wing on W@@ ester@@ n experience , looking at it through W@@ ester@@ n eyes , using W@@ ester@@ n conc@@ ep@@ ts ."
If you want to know why we un@@ er@@ r@@ ing@@ ly se@@ em to get China wrong — our predi@@ ctions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are in@@ cor@@ rec@@ t — this is the reason .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , I think , I have to say that I think at@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de to@@ wards China is that of a kind of little W@@ est@@ ern@@ er men@@ tal@@ ity ."
It &apos;s kind of ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant .
"It &apos;s ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant in the sense that we think that we are best , and th@@ ere@@ fore we have the univers@@ al meas@@ ure ."
"And secon@@ dly , it &apos;s ig@@ no@@ ran@@ t ."
We re@@ fu@@ se to really add@@ ress the issue of difference .
"You know , there &apos;s a very interesting pas@@ sage in a book by P@@ au@@ l C@@ oh@@ en , the American h@@ istori@@ an ."
And P@@ au@@ l C@@ oh@@ en argu@@ es that the W@@ est thin@@ ks of itself as probably the most c@@ os@@ mo@@ polit@@ an of all cul@@ tures .
But it &apos;s not .
"In many ways , it &apos;s the most pa@@ ro@@ chi@@ al , because for 2@@ 00 years , the W@@ est has been so dom@@ in@@ ant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cul@@ tures , other ci@@ viliz@@ ations ."
"Because , at the end of the day , it could , if ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ary by for@@ ce , get its own way ."
"Wh@@ ere@@ as those cul@@ tures — vir@@ tually the re@@ st of the world , in fact , which have been in a far we@@ ak@@ er pos@@ ition , vis@@ -@@ a-@@ v@@ is the W@@ est — have been th@@ ere@@ by for@@ ced to understand the W@@ est , because of the W@@ est &apos;s pres@@ ence in those soci@@ et@@ ies ."
"And th@@ ere@@ fore , they are , as a resul@@ t , more c@@ os@@ mo@@ polit@@ an in many ways than the W@@ est ."
"I mean , take the question of E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a : J@@ ap@@ an , K@@ ore@@ a , China , et@@ c . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there ."
Now the lar@@ g@@ est economic regi@@ on in the world .
"And I &apos;ll tell you now , that E@@ ast A@@ si@@ an@@ ers , people from E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a , are far more knowled@@ ge@@ able about the W@@ est than the W@@ est is about E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"Now this point is very ger@@ man@@ e , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id , to the present ."
"Because what &apos;s happening ? B@@ ack to that ch@@ art at the beginning , the G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s ch@@ art ."
"What is happening is that , very ra@@ pi@@ dly in hist@@ or@@ ical terms , the world is being dri@@ ven and sh@@ ap@@ ed , not by the old develop@@ ed countries , but by the develop@@ ing world ."
"We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G@@ 20 us@@ ur@@ ping very ra@@ pi@@ dly the pos@@ ition of the G@@ 7 , or the G@@ 8 ."
And there are two con@@ sequ@@ ences of this .
"F@@ i@@ rst , the W@@ est is ra@@ pi@@ dly lo@@ sing its inf@@ lu@@ ence in the world ."
"There was a dra@@ m@@ atic il@@ lu@@ str@@ ation of this actually a year ago — C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en , clim@@ ate change con@@ fer@@ ence ."
Euro@@ pe was not at the fin@@ al ne@@ got@@ i@@ ating table .
Wh@@ en did that last happen ?
I would w@@ ag@@ er it was probably about 2@@ 00 years ago .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
"And the second imp@@ lic@@ ation is that the world will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably , as a con@@ sequ@@ ence , become incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly un@@ famili@@ ar to us , because it &apos;ll be sh@@ ap@@ ed by cul@@ tures and experi@@ ences and h@@ istori@@ es that we are not really famili@@ ar with , or con@@ vers@@ ant with ."
"And at last , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id — take Euro@@ pe ; America is sli@@ gh@@ tly different — but Euro@@ pe@@ ans by and large , I have to say , are ig@@ no@@ ran@@ t , are u@@ na@@ w@@ are about the way the world is chang@@ ing ."
"S@@ ome people — I &apos;ve got an En@@ gli@@ sh friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The contin@@ ent is sle@@ ep@@ wal@@ king into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation ."
But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Euro@@ pe is incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly out of tou@@ ch with the world — and that is a sort of lo@@ s@@ s of a sense of the future .
"I mean , Euro@@ pe once , of course , once com@@ man@@ ded the future in its con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence ."
"Ta@@ ke the 19@@ th century , for example ."
"But this , al@@ as , is no longer true ."
"If you want to feel the future , if you want to ta@@ st@@ e the future , try China — there &apos;s old Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us ."
This is a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation the lik@@ es of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation .
This is the new &#91; W@@ u@@ h@@ an &#93; ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation for the high@@ -@@ spe@@ ed tra@@ ins .
China already has a bi@@ g@@ ger net@@ work than any other country in the world and will so@@ on have more than all the re@@ st of the world put together .
"O@@ r take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tri@@ ed out shor@@ tly in a su@@ bur@@ b of B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing ."
"H@@ ere you have a me@@ g@@ ab@@ us , on the u@@ pp@@ er de@@ ck car@@ ri@@ es about 2@@ ,000 people ."
"It trav@@ els on ra@@ il@@ s down a su@@ bur@@ b@@ an ro@@ ad , and the car@@ s trav@@ el under@@ ne@@ ath it ."
And it does spe@@ ed@@ s of up to about 100 mil@@ es an h@@ our .
"Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very speci@@ fic problem , which is different from Euro@@ pe and different from the United States : China has huge num@@ bers of people and no space ."
"So this is a solution to a situ@@ ation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people ."
"O@@ kay , so how would I like to fin@@ ish ?"
"Well , what should our at@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de be to@@ wards this world that we see very ra@@ pi@@ dly develop@@ ing before us ?"
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
"But I want to argu@@ e , ab@@ ov@@ e all , a bi@@ g@@ -@@ picture pos@@ itive for this world ."
"For 2@@ 00 years , the world was es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally gov@@ er@@ ned by a fra@@ g@@ ment of the human population ."
That &apos;s what Euro@@ pe and Nor@@ th America re@@ pres@@ ented .
"The ar@@ ri@@ val of countries like China and India — between them 3@@ 8 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like In@@ don@@ es@@ ia and B@@ raz@@ il and so on , re@@ present the most important single act of demo@@ c@@ rat@@ iz@@ ation in the last 2@@ 00 years ."
"C@@ iv@@ iliz@@ ations and cul@@ tures , which had been ig@@ no@@ red , which had no vo@@ ice , which were not list@@ en@@ ed to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation in this world ."
"As hum@@ ani@@ sts , we must w@@ el@@ come , su@@ rely , this trans@@ form@@ ation , and we will have to learn about these ci@@ viliz@@ ations ."
"This big ship here was the one sa@@ il@@ ed in by Z@@ h@@ en@@ g He in the early 1@@ 5@@ th century on his great vo@@ y@@ ages around the S@@ outh China Se@@ a , the E@@ ast China Se@@ a and across the Indi@@ an O@@ c@@ ean to E@@ ast Africa ."
"The little bo@@ at in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Ch@@ ri@@ sto@@ ph@@ er C@@ ol@@ um@@ bu@@ s c@@ ros@@ sed the A@@ t@@ lan@@ ti@@ c ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ r , look care@@ fully at this sil@@ k sc@@ ro@@ ll made by Z@@ hu@@ Z@@ h@@ ou in 1@@ 3@@ 6@@ 8 ."
I think they &apos;re pla@@ ying gol@@ f .
"Ch@@ ri@@ st , the Ch@@ in@@ ese even inv@@ ented gol@@ f ."
W@@ el@@ come to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to start a revol@@ ution .
"Now before you get up in ar@@ ms , or you bre@@ ak into s@@ ong , or you pic@@ k a fav@@ or@@ ite col@@ or , I want to def@@ ine what I mean by revol@@ ution ."
"B@@ y revol@@ ution , I mean a d@@ rast@@ ic and far@@ -@@ re@@ ach@@ ing change in the way we think and be@@ have — the way we think and the way we be@@ have ."
"Now why , S@@ te@@ ve , why do we need a revol@@ ution ?"
We need a revol@@ ution because things are@@ n &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
And that makes me really sa@@ d because I &apos;m si@@ ck and ti@@ red of things not working .
"You know , I &apos;m si@@ ck and ti@@ red of us not living up to our pot@@ ential ."
I &apos;m si@@ ck and ti@@ red of us being last .
"And we are last place in so many things — for example , social fac@@ tors ."
We &apos;re last place in Euro@@ pe in innov@@ ation .
"There we are right at the end , right at the bot@@ tom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t val@@ ue innov@@ ation ."
"We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ."
"And there we are , not just last in the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , we &apos;re last in Euro@@ pe , at the very bot@@ tom ."
"And wor@@ st of all , it just came out three we@@ eks ago , many of you have seen it , The E@@ co@@ no@@ m@@ ist ."
"We &apos;re the sa@@ d@@ d@@ est place on Earth , rel@@ ative to G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a — the sa@@ d@@ d@@ est place on Earth ."
That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
Wh@@ ere do we ran@@ k three we@@ eks ago in another re@@ port by the O@@ E@@ C@@ D ?
"L@@ ast in read@@ ing , mat@@ h and science . L@@ ast ."
B@@ us@@ in@@ ess : The lo@@ w@@ est perc@@ ep@@ tion in the E@@ .@@ U@@ .
that ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s pro@@ vide ben@@ ef@@ its to society .
"Wh@@ y as a resul@@ t , what happens ?"
The lo@@ w@@ est perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s star@@ ting busin@@ ess@@ es .
And this is des@@ p@@ ite the fact that everybody kno@@ ws that small business is the eng@@ ine of econo@@ mi@@ es .
We hi@@ re the most people ; we create the most ta@@ x@@ es .
"So if our eng@@ ine &apos;s bro@@ k@@ en , gu@@ ess what ?"
L@@ ast in Euro@@ pe G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a .
L@@ ast .
"So it &apos;s no surpri@@ se , guys , that 6@@ 2 percent of B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ ans are not op@@ tim@@ ist@@ ic about the future ."
"We &apos;re un@@ happy , we have bad education , and we have the wor@@ st busin@@ ess@@ es ."
"And these are fac@@ ts , guys ."
This isn &apos;t story tal@@ e ; it &apos;s not mak@@ e-@@ believe .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a con@@ sp@@ ira@@ cy I have got against B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ a . These are fac@@ ts .
"So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is bro@@ k@@ en ."
"The way we think , the way we be@@ have , our oper@@ ating system of be@@ having is bro@@ k@@ en ."
"We need a d@@ rast@@ ic change in the way we think and be@@ have to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ a for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future ."
How did this happen ?
Let &apos;s be pos@@ itive now . We &apos;re going to get pos@@ itive . How did this happen ?
I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be d@@ rast@@ ic to some of you — because we are han@@ di@@ ca@@ pp@@ ing ourselves .
We &apos;re hol@@ ding ourselves back because we don &apos;t val@@ ue play .
"I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right ."
"In case some of you for@@ got what play is , this is what play looks like ."
"B@@ ab@@ ies play , kids play , a@@ du@@ l@@ ts play ."
We don &apos;t val@@ ue play .
"In fact , we de@@ val@@ ue play ."
And we de@@ val@@ ue it in three are@@ as .
Let &apos;s go back to the same three are@@ as .
So@@ cial : 4@@ 5 years of what ?
"O@@ f comm@@ un@@ ism — of val@@ u@@ ing the society and the state over the individu@@ al and squ@@ ash@@ ing , in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently , cre@@ ativ@@ ity , individu@@ al self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion and innov@@ ation ."
"And instead , what do we val@@ ue ?"
"Because it &apos;s sho@@ wn the way we ap@@ ply , gener@@ ate and use knowled@@ ge is aff@@ ec@@ ted by our social and instit@@ u@@ ti@@ onal con@@ text , which told us what in comm@@ un@@ ism ?"
T@@ o be seri@@ ous .
"To be really , really seri@@ ous ."
It did .
( Applause ) B@@ e seri@@ ous .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been s@@ col@@ ded in the par@@ k for let@@ ting my kids play on the ground .
"H@@ e@@ av@@ en for@@ bi@@ d they play in the di@@ r@@ t , the ka@@ l , or even wor@@ se , lo@@ kv@@ i , water — that will k@@ ill them ."
I have been told by bab@@ as and dy@@ a@@ do@@ s that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is seri@@ ous and we need to tra@@ in them for the seri@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess of life .
We have a seri@@ ous mem@@ e ru@@ n@@ ning through .
It &apos;s a social gen@@ e ru@@ n@@ ning through us .
It &apos;s a seri@@ ous gen@@ e .
It &apos;s 4@@ 5 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; bab@@ a fac@@ tor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
"S@@ te@@ p one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a bab@@ y . I@@ s@@ ka@@ m bab@@ y . &quot; &quot; S@@ te@@ p two : we get the bab@@ y . W@@ o@@ o@@ ho@@ o !"
But then what happens in step three ?
I want to go back to work because I need to f@@ ur@@ ther my care@@ er or I just want to go have co@@ ff@@ e@@ es .
I &apos;m going to give be@@ b@@ ko to bab@@ a .
But we need to remember that bab@@ a &apos;s been inf@@ ec@@ ted by the seri@@ ous mem@@ e for 4@@ 5 years .
So what happens ?
"S@@ he pas@@ ses that viru@@ s on to bab@@ y , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the red@@ wo@@ od tre@@ es — for that seri@@ ous mem@@ e to get out of our oper@@ ating system ."
What happens then ?
"It goes into education where we have an anti@@ qu@@ ated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that val@@ ues ro@@ te learning , mem@@ or@@ iz@@ ation and stan@@ dar@@ diz@@ ation , and de@@ val@@ ues self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , self-@@ expl@@ or@@ ation , questi@@ on@@ ing , cre@@ ativ@@ ity and play ."
It &apos;s a cra@@ p system .
T@@ ru@@ e story : I went looking for a school for my ki@@ d .
We went to this pre@@ sti@@ gi@@ ous little school and they say they &apos;re going to study mat@@ h 10 times a week and science e@@ ight times a week and read@@ ing five times a day and all this stuff .
"And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and rec@@ ess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ a . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the sch@@ e@@ du@@ le . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a cri@@ me . What a cri@@ me ."
"And it &apos;s a cri@@ me that our education system is so seri@@ ous because education is seri@@ ous that we &apos;re cre@@ ating min@@ dl@@ ess , robot@@ ic work@@ ers to put bol@@ ts in pre@@ -@@ d@@ r@@ ill@@ ed hol@@ es ."
"But I &apos;m sor@@ ry , the problems of today are not the problems of the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ evol@@ ution ."
"We need ada@@ p@@ ta@@ bil@@ ity , the ability to learn how to be cre@@ ative and innov@@ ative ."
We don &apos;t need me@@ chan@@ iz@@ ed work@@ ers .
"But no , now our mem@@ e goes into work where we don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"We create robot@@ ic work@@ ers that we tre@@ at like as@@ s@@ ets , to le@@ ver and just th@@ row away ."
What are qu@@ al@@ ities of a B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ an work ?
A@@ u@@ to@@ c@@ r@@ atic — do what I say because I &apos;m the che@@ f .
I &apos;m the b@@ os@@ s and I know better than you .
"U@@ n@@ tru@@ st@@ ing — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously a cri@@ min@@ al , so I &apos;m going to inst@@ all cam@@ er@@ as ."
"( Laughter ) Con@@ tro@@ l@@ ling — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously an i@@ di@@ ot , so I &apos;m going to make a z@@ il@@ lion little proc@@ ess@@ es for you to fol@@ low so you don &apos;t step out of the bo@@ x ."

That &apos;s some@@ how un@@ profes@@ si@@ onal and bad .
"And at the end of the day , it &apos;s un@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ing because you &apos;re contro@@ l@@ led , you &apos;re re@@ stri@@ cted , you &apos;re not val@@ u@@ ed and you &apos;re not having any fu@@ n ."
"In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , S@@ te@@ ve . What a dum@@ b idea ."
It can &apos;t be because of play .
"@@ Ju@@ st play , that &apos;s a stup@@ id thing . &quot; &quot; We have the seri@@ ous mem@@ e in us ."
Well I &apos;m going to say no .
"And I will pro@@ ve it to you in the next part of the spe@@ ec@@ h — that play is the cat@@ al@@ y@@ st , it is the revol@@ ution , that we can use to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ a for the better ."
P@@ la@@ y : our bra@@ ins are har@@ d@@ wi@@ red for play .
"E@@ vol@@ ution has sel@@ ec@@ ted , over milli@@ ons and bil@@ li@@ ons of years , for play in animals and in humans ."
And you know what ?
"E@@ vol@@ ution does a really , really good job of des@@ elec@@ ting tra@@ its that are@@ n &apos;t adv@@ anta@@ ge@@ ous to us and sel@@ ec@@ ting tra@@ its for comp@@ et@@ itive adv@@ anta@@ ge ."

But what you may not know is that be@@ ar@@ s that play more survi@@ ve longer .
It &apos;s not the be@@ ar@@ s that learn how to fish better .
It &apos;s the ones that play more .
"And a fin@@ al really interesting study — it &apos;s been sho@@ wn , a cor@@ rel@@ ation between play and brain size ."
"The more you play , the bi@@ g@@ ger the bra@@ ins there are ."
"D@@ ol@@ ph@@ ins , pretty big bra@@ ins , play a lot ."
But who do you think with the bi@@ gg@@ est bra@@ ins are the bi@@ gg@@ est pla@@ y@@ ers ?
Y@@ ours tru@@ ly : humans .
"K@@ i@@ ds play , we play — of every n@@ ation@@ ality , of every ra@@ ce , of every col@@ or , of every religi@@ on ."
It &apos;s a univers@@ al thing — we play .
"And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s a@@ du@@ l@@ ts too ."
Re@@ ally co@@ ol ter@@ m : ne@@ ot@@ eny — the re@@ ten@@ tion of play and ju@@ ven@@ ile tra@@ its in a@@ du@@ l@@ ts .
And who are the bi@@ gg@@ est ne@@ ot@@ eni@@ sts ?
H@@ um@@ ans . We play s@@ por@@ ts .
"We do it for fu@@ n , or as O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ ans , or as profes@@ sion@@ als ."
We play mu@@ si@@ cal instru@@ ments .
"We dan@@ ce , we k@@ is@@ s , we sing , we just go@@ of around ."
We &apos;re desig@@ ned by nature to play from bir@@ th to old age .
We &apos;re desig@@ ned to do that contin@@ u@@ ously — to play and play a lot and not stop pla@@ ying .
It is a huge ben@@ ef@@ it .
"@@ Ju@@ st like there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its to animals , there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its to humans ."
"For example , it &apos;s been sho@@ wn to st@@ im@@ ul@@ ate neu@@ ral growth in the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , in the area where it contro@@ ls emot@@ i@@ ons ."
It &apos;s been sho@@ wn to pro@@ mot@@ e pre@@ -@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ ment where a lot of c@@ og@@ n@@ ition is happening .
"As a resul@@ t , what happens ?"
We devel@@ op more emot@@ i@@ onal mat@@ ur@@ ity if we play more .
We devel@@ op better deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making ability if we play more .
These guys are fac@@ ts .
"It &apos;s not fic@@ tion , it &apos;s not story tal@@ es , it &apos;s not mak@@ e-@@ believe ; it &apos;s c@@ old , hard science ."
These are the ben@@ ef@@ its to play .
"It is a genet@@ ic bir@@ th@@ right that we have , like wal@@ king or spe@@ a@@ king or seeing ."
"And if we han@@ di@@ ca@@ p ourselves with play , we han@@ di@@ ca@@ p ourselves as if we would with any other bir@@ th@@ right that we have ."
We h@@ old ourselves back .
L@@ it@@ tle ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
"I@@ mag@@ ine a world without the@@ ater , without the ar@@ ts , without s@@ ong , without dan@@ cing , without so@@ cc@@ er , without fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all , without l@@ aughter ."
What does this world look like ?
It &apos;s pretty b@@ le@@ ak .
It &apos;s pretty gl@@ um .
Now imagine your work@@ place .
I@@ s it fu@@ n ? I@@ s it pla@@ y@@ ful ?
O@@ r maybe the work@@ place of your friends — here we &apos;re for@@ ward thinking .
I@@ s it fu@@ n ? I@@ s it pla@@ y@@ ful ?
"O@@ r is it cra@@ p ? I@@ s it au@@ to@@ c@@ r@@ atic , contro@@ l@@ ling , re@@ stri@@ ctive and un@@ tru@@ st@@ ing and un@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ing ?"
We have this conc@@ ept that the op@@ pos@@ ite of play is work .
We even feel gu@@ il@@ ty if we &apos;re seen pla@@ ying at work .
"&quot; Oh , my colle@@ ag@@ ues see me l@@ augh@@ ing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hi@@ de because my b@@ os@@ s might see me ."
He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is back@@ wards .
The op@@ pos@@ ite of play is not work . The op@@ pos@@ ite of play
is depres@@ sion . It &apos;s depres@@ sion .
"In fact , play impro@@ ves our work ."
"@@ Ju@@ st like there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its for humans and animals , there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its for play at work ."
"For example , it st@@ im@@ ul@@ ates cre@@ ativ@@ ity ."
It incre@@ ases our op@@ en@@ ness to change .
It impro@@ ves our ability to learn .
"It pro@@ vid@@ es a sense of pur@@ pose and ma@@ st@@ ery — two key mot@@ iv@@ ational things that incre@@ ase produc@@ tiv@@ ity , through play ."
"So before you start thinking of play as just not seri@@ ous , play doesn &apos;t mean fri@@ vol@@ ous ."
"You know , the profes@@ si@@ onal a@@ th@@ l@@ ete that lov@@ es s@@ ki@@ ing , he &apos;s seri@@ ous about it , but he lov@@ es it ."
"He &apos;s having fu@@ n , he &apos;s in the gro@@ ov@@ e , he &apos;s in the f@@ low ."
"A doc@@ tor might be seri@@ ous , but l@@ aughter &apos;s still a great medi@@ c@@ ine ."
O@@ ur thinking is back@@ wards .
We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be feel@@ ing gu@@ il@@ ty .
We should be c@@ ele@@ b@@ rat@@ ing play .
Q@@ u@@ ick example from the cor@@ por@@ ate world .
"F@@ ed@@ E@@ x , easy mot@@ to : people , ser@@ vice , prof@@ it ."
"If you tre@@ at your people like people , if you tre@@ at them great , they &apos;re happ@@ i@@ er , they &apos;re ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ed , they have a sense of ma@@ st@@ ery and pur@@ pose ."
"What happens ? They give better ser@@ vice — not wor@@ se , but better ."
"And when cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers call for ser@@ vice and they &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with happy people that can make deci@@ sions and are ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ed , how do the cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers feel ? They feel great ."
"And what do great cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers do , gre@@ at@@ -@@ feel@@ ing cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ?"
"They bu@@ y more of your ser@@ vice and they tell more of their friends , which lea@@ ds to more prof@@ it ."
"P@@ eople , ser@@ vice , prof@@ it ."
"P@@ la@@ y incre@@ ases produc@@ tiv@@ ity , not de@@ cre@@ ases ."
"And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; G@@ ee , that can work for F@@ ed@@ E@@ x out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ a ."
"No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ a , you guys . T@@ w@@ o reas@@ ons ."
"One , play is univers@@ al ."
"There &apos;s nothing we@@ ird about B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ ans that we can &apos;t play , bes@@ id@@ es the seri@@ ous mem@@ e that we have to k@@ ick out ."
"T@@ w@@ o , I &apos;ve tri@@ ed it . I &apos;ve tri@@ ed at S@@ ci@@ ant ."
"When I got there , we had zer@@ o happy cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ."
N@@ ot one cu@@ st@@ om@@ er would re@@ f@@ er us .
I asked them all .
We had mar@@ g@@ in@@ al prof@@ it — I did .
"We had mar@@ g@@ in@@ al prof@@ its , and we had un@@ happy st@@ ak@@ eh@@ ol@@ ders ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh some ba@@ sic change , change like impro@@ ving tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy , change like pro@@ mot@@ ing self-@@ direc@@ tion and col@@ labor@@ ation , en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging col@@ labor@@ ation , not au@@ to@@ cra@@ cy , the things like having a resul@@ ts@@ -@@ foc@@ us ."
I don &apos;t care when you get in in the mor@@ ning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
I care that your cu@@ st@@ om@@ er and your team is happy and you &apos;re organiz@@ ed with that .
Why do I care if you get in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck ?
B@@ a@@ sically pro@@ mot@@ ing fu@@ n .
"Th@@ rou@@ gh pro@@ mot@@ ing fu@@ n and a great environment , we were able to trans@@ form S@@ ci@@ ant and , in just three shor@@ t years — s@@ oun@@ ds like a long time , but change is s@@ low — every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er , from zer@@ o to every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing us , ab@@ ov@@ e aver@@ age prof@@ its for the indu@@ stry and happy st@@ ak@@ eh@@ ol@@ ders ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did w@@ in , every year that we en@@ ter@@ ed , one of the ran@@ kin@@ gs for best em@@ plo@@ y@@ er for small business ."
In@@ de@@ pen@@ dent anal@@ ys@@ is from an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es on their sur@@ ve@@ ys .
"It does , and it can , work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ a ."
"There &apos;s nothing hol@@ ding us back , exc@@ ept our own men@@ tal@@ ity about play ."
So some step@@ s that we can take — to fin@@ ish up — how to make this revol@@ ution through play .
"F@@ i@@ rst of all , you have to believe me ."
"If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something ."
"Se@@ con@@ d of all , if you don &apos;t have the feel@@ ing of play in you , you need to red@@ is@@ c@@ over play ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever it was that as a ki@@ d you used to en@@ jo@@ y , that you en@@ jo@@ yed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that pro@@ mot@@ ion you can &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y , because you feel like you have to be seri@@ ous , red@@ is@@ c@@ over it ."
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s m@@ oun@@ tain bi@@ king or read@@ ing a book or pla@@ ying a game .
"R@@ ed@@ is@@ c@@ over that because you &apos;re the lea@@ ders , the innov@@ ation lea@@ ders , the thought lea@@ ders ."
You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the off@@ ice or talk to your friends and ig@@ n@@ ite the fi@@ re of change in the play revol@@ ution .
"You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feel@@ ing it , your colle@@ ag@@ ues , your em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es , are@@ n &apos;t going to feel it ."
"You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m going to tru@@ st you . &quot; &quot; W@@ e@@ ird conc@@ ept : I hi@@ red you ; I should tru@@ st you ."
"I &apos;m going to let you make deci@@ sions . I &apos;m going to em@@ power you , and I &apos;m going to del@@ eg@@ ate to the lo@@ w@@ est level , rather than the top ."
I &apos;m going to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge con@@ stru@@ ctive c@@ rit@@ ic@@ ism .
I &apos;m going to let you chall@@ enge au@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
Because it &apos;s by chall@@ eng@@ ing the way things are always done is that we are able to bre@@ ak out of the ru@@ t that we &apos;re in and create innov@@ ative sol@@ utions to problems of today .
We &apos;re not always right as lea@@ ders .
We &apos;re going to er@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ ate fe@@ ar .
F@@ e@@ ar is the en@@ emy of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like el@@ im@@ in@@ ate re@@ stri@@ ctions .
"You know what , let them use their mobil@@ e phone for pers@@ onal call@@ s — he@@ av@@ en for@@ bi@@ d ."
Let them be on the Internet .
Let them be on inst@@ ant mes@@ sen@@ g@@ ers .
Let them take long l@@ un@@ ch@@ es .
L@@ un@@ ch is like the rec@@ ess for work .
"It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you re@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge your brain , you me@@ et your friends , you have a be@@ er , you have some food , you talk , you get some sy@@ ner@@ gy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before ."
"L@@ et them do it . G@@ i@@ ve them some fre@@ e@@ dom , and in gener@@ al , let them play . Let them have fu@@ n at the work@@ place ."
"We spend so much of our lives at the work@@ place , and it &apos;s sup@@ posed to be , what , a mis@@ er@@ able gr@@ ind , so that 20 years from now , we wa@@ ke up and say , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this it ?"
I@@ s that all there was ? &quot; &quot; U@@ na@@ cc@@ ep@@ table . Ne@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
"( Laughter ) So in sum@@ mar@@ y , we need a d@@ rast@@ ic change in the way we think and be@@ have , but we don &apos;t need a work@@ ers &apos; revol@@ ution ."
We don &apos;t need a work@@ ers &apos; revol@@ ution .
What we need is a pla@@ y@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a pla@@ y@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a pla@@ y@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing .
"S@@ eri@@ ously , we need to b@@ and together . T@@ oday is the start of the u@@ pri@@ sing . But what you need to do is f@@ an the fl@@ am@@ es of the revol@@ ution . You need to go and share your ideas and your succ@@ ess st@@ ori@@ es@@ "
"@@ of what worked about re@@ in@@ vi@@ gor@@ ating our lives , our scho@@ ols , and our work with play ; about how play pro@@ mot@@ es a sense of pro@@ mi@@ se and self-@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment ; of how play pro@@ mot@@ es innov@@ ation and produc@@ tiv@@ ity , and , ul@@ tim@@ ately , how play cre@@ ates me@@ an@@ ing ."
"Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ a for the better ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by off@@ ering you a free no-@@ te@@ ch life h@@ ack , and all it re@@ qui@@ res of you is this : that you change your post@@ ure for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ dit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making y@@ ourselves sm@@ all@@ er ?
S@@ omet@@ imes we h@@ old on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ omet@@ imes we s@@ pre@@ ad out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to p@@ ay atten@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re particul@@ arly interest@@ ed in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interest@@ ed in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a sm@@ ile , or a con@@ tem@@ p@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a han@@ d@@ sha@@ ke ."
N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New York T@@ imes .
"So obvi@@ ously when we think about no@@ n@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavi@@ or , or body language — but we call it no@@ n@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communic@@ ation ."
"When we think about communic@@ ation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
"And those ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments can predi@@ ct really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we hi@@ re or pro@@ mot@@ e , who we ask out on a d@@ ate ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ in@@ i A@@ m@@ b@@ ad@@ y , a resear@@ ch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts Uni@@ vers@@ ity , shows that when people wat@@ ch 3@@ 0-@@ second s@@ oun@@ dl@@ ess c@@ li@@ ps of real physi@@ ci@@ an@@ -@@ pati@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the physi@@ ci@@ an &apos;s ni@@ c@@ en@@ ess predi@@ ct whether or not that physi@@ ci@@ an will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . R@@ ight ?"
"We are also inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ced by our no@@ n@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ ghts and our feel@@ ings and our physi@@ olog@@ y ."
So what no@@ n@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ist . I study pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , and I te@@ ach at a comp@@ et@@ itive business school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interest@@ ed in power dy@@ na@@ m@@ ics ."
I became es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally interest@@ ed in no@@ n@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance .
And what are no@@ n@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance ?
"So in the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about ex@@ pan@@ ding ."
"So you make y@@ ourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically op@@ ening up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ ening up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ es@@ si@@ ca T@@ ra@@ cy has studi@@ ed ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really powerful with us , we t@@ end to make ourselves sm@@ all@@ er . We don &apos;t mir@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavi@@ or in the clas@@ s@@ room , and what do I not@@ ice ?"
"When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of s@@ pre@@ ad out ."
"You have other people who are vir@@ tually col@@ la@@ p@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I not@@ ice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more lik@@ ely to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ om@@ en feel ch@@ ro@@ ni@@ cally less powerful than men , so this is not surpri@@ sing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A clas@@ s@@ room , because parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So business scho@@ ols have been stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating ."
There &apos;s some evid@@ ence that they do .
"So , for example , we sm@@ ile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ ced to sm@@ ile by hol@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ et@@ h like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bod@@ ies , but is it also true that our bod@@ ies change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the powerful ver@@ su@@ s the power@@ less look like ?
"So powerful people t@@ end to be , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ dent , more op@@ tim@@ ist@@ ic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to w@@ in even at g@@ am@@ es of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ri@@ sk@@ s .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to st@@ ress ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power le@@ ad@@ er that &apos;s dom@@ in@@ ant , high on test@@ ost@@ er@@ one , but really st@@ ress re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"P@@ rob@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this evid@@ ence , both that the body can sh@@ ape the mind , at least at the fac@@ i@@ al level , and also that ro@@ le changes can sh@@ ape the mind ."
"So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ im@@ al level , like this tiny m@@ ani@@ pul@@ ation , this tiny inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sit@@ ting .
And here are the lo@@ w@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making y@@ ourself small ."
"When you &apos;re tou@@ ching your ne@@ ck , you &apos;re really prote@@ c@@ ting y@@ ourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experim@@ ent .
Here &apos;s what we find on test@@ ost@@ er@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ t@@ is@@ ol .
"So it se@@ ems that our no@@ n@@ ver@@ b@@ als do gov@@ er@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bod@@ ies change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative situ@@ ations , like social thre@@ at situ@@ ations ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to y@@ ourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recor@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is wor@@ se than being h@@ ec@@ kl@@ ed ."
P@@ eople h@@ ate this .
"We then have these c@@ od@@ ers look at these ta@@ p@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is . They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the cond@@ itions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ ec@@ h .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the eff@@ ect , or medi@@ ating the eff@@ ect ."
"So I said , fa@@ ke it t@@ ill you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ post@@ or .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad car ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a car , ro@@ l@@ led sever@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the car .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had id@@ enti@@ fi@@ ed with being sm@@ art , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of colle@@ ge , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish colle@@ ge ."
I am an im@@ post@@ or .
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"L@@ ike , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feel@@ ing ."
"L@@ ike , she can fa@@ ke it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fa@@ ke it t@@ ill you make it ."
F@@ a@@ ke it t@@ ill you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ e .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ iny t@@ we@@ ak@@ s can le@@ ad to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ w@@ o minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your test@@ ost@@ er@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ t@@ is@@ ol down .
"D@@ on &apos;t leave that situ@@ ation feel@@ ing like , o@@ h , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."

"B@@ e@@ a@@ u L@@ ot@@ to : So , this game is very simple ."
All you have to do is read what you see . R@@ ight ?
"So , I &apos;m going to coun@@ t to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together ."
"O@@ kay , one , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ A@@ udi@@ ence : C@@ an you read this ?"
"B@@ L : A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing . What about this one ? One , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ A@@ udi@@ ence : You are not read@@ ing this ."
"B@@ L : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three ."
A@@ udi@@ ence : What are you read@@ ing ?
B@@ L : What are you read@@ ing ? There are no words there .
"I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . R@@ ight ?"
"It liter@@ ally says , &quot; &quot; W@@ at ar ou re@@ a in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) R@@ ight ?"
That &apos;s what you should have said . R@@ ight ? Why is this ?
It &apos;s because perc@@ ep@@ tion is gro@@ un@@ ded in our experience .
"R@@ ight ? The brain takes me@@ an@@ in@@ gl@@ ess information and makes me@@ an@@ ing out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was u@@ se@@ ful to see in the past ."
"A@@ ll right ? Wh@@ ich means , when it comes to perc@@ ep@@ tion , we &apos;re all like this f@@ ro@@ g ."
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s gener@@ ating behavi@@ or that &apos;s u@@ se@@ ful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( V@@ ideo ) M@@ an : O@@ w ! O@@ w ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) B@@ L : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit an@@ no@@ yed , right ?"
"But we &apos;re talking about perc@@ ep@@ tion here , right ?"
"And perc@@ ep@@ tion under@@ p@@ ins everything we think , we know , we believe , our ho@@ p@@ es , our dre@@ am@@ s , the clo@@ th@@ es we we@@ ar , f@@ all@@ ing in love , everything beg@@ ins with perc@@ ep@@ tion ."
"Now if perc@@ ep@@ tion is gro@@ un@@ ded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever respon@@ ding ac@@ cor@@ ding to what we &apos;ve done before ."
"But actually , it &apos;s a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous problem , because how can we ever see differ@@ ently ?"
"Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differ@@ ently , and all new perc@@ ep@@ tions beg@@ in in the same way ."
They beg@@ in with a question .
The problem with questions is they create un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"Now , un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ar@@ ily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a pred@@ ator , it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
O@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) E@@ ven se@@ a@@ si@@ ck@@ ness is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"R@@ ight ? If you go down bel@@ ow on a bo@@ at , your in@@ ner ear@@ s are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Y@@ our eyes , because it &apos;s moving in regi@@ ster with the bo@@ at , say I &apos;m standing still ."
"@@ Y@@ our brain can@@ not de@@ al with the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of that information , and it gets ill ."
"The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dan@@ ger@@ ous things you can do , because it takes you into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ."
"And yet , the i@@ ro@@ ny is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space ."
"So how can we ever do anything new ? Well for@@ tun@@ ately , evol@@ ution has given us an answer , right ?"
And it en@@ ab@@ les us to add@@ ress even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . R@@ ight ?
"It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life beg@@ in , or what ex@@ ten@@ ds be@@ y@@ ond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really ste@@ pp@@ ing into that space ."
So what is evol@@ ution &apos;s answer to the problem of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . E@@ x@@ per@@ ts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
P@@ la@@ y is one of the only human en@@ de@@ av@@ ors where un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is actually c@@ ele@@ b@@ rat@@ ed . U@@ n@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is what makes play fu@@ n .
"R@@ ight ? It &apos;s ada@@ p@@ table to change . R@@ ight ? It op@@ ens pos@@ sibil@@ ity , and it &apos;s co@@ oper@@ ative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social b@@ on@@ ding , and it &apos;s in@@ tr@@ in@@ sically mot@@ iv@@ ated . What that means is that we play to play . P@@ la@@ y is its own re@@ ward ."
"Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the ex@@ act same ways of being you need in order to be a good sci@@ ent@@ ist ."
S@@ ci@@ ence is not de@@ fin@@ ed by the me@@ th@@ od se@@ ction of a pa@@ per .
"It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is cre@@ ative ."
"So if you ad@@ d ru@@ les to play , you have a game ."
That &apos;s actually what an experim@@ ent is .
"So ar@@ med with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experim@@ ents are play , we asked , can any@@ one become a sci@@ ent@@ ist ?"
And who better to ask than 25 ei@@ gh@@ t@@ - to 1@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old children ?
"Because they &apos;re ex@@ per@@ ts in play . So I took my be@@ e ar@@ ena down to a small school in D@@ ev@@ on , and the a@@ im of this was to not just get the kids to see science differ@@ ently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differ@@ ently . R@@ ight ?"
The first step was to ask a question .
"Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get fun@@ ding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a u@@ se@@ ful con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to science , and the teach@@ ers said kids couldn &apos;t do it ."
So we did it any@@ way . R@@ ight ? O@@ f course .
"So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small prin@@ t so you wouldn &apos;t bo@@ ther read@@ ing it . Po@@ in@@ t is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the bas@@ is of science publi@@ c@@ ation the last five to 15 years . R@@ ight ?"
So they were as@@ king questions that were sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant to ex@@ per@@ t scientists .
"Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite speci@@ al . R@@ ight ?"
"S@@ he was one of the young people who was invol@@ ved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youn@@ g@@ est publi@@ shed scientists in the world . R@@ ight ? She will now , once she comes on@@ to stage , will be the youn@@ g@@ est person to ever speak at TED . R@@ ight ?"
"Now , science and as@@ king questions is about cou@@ ra@@ ge ."
"Now she is the person@@ i@@ fic@@ ation of cou@@ ra@@ ge , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all ."
"So A@@ my , would you ple@@ ase come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So A@@ my &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton B@@ e@@ es Pro@@ ject , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go a@@ head , A@@ my ."
"A@@ my O &apos;@@ T@@ o@@ ole : Thank you , B@@ e@@ a@@ u . We thought that it was easy to see the lin@@ k between humans and ap@@ es in the way that we think , because we look ali@@ ke ."
"But we wonder@@ ed if there &apos;s a possible lin@@ k with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and be@@ es thought si@@ mil@@ ar , since they se@@ em so different from us ."
So we asked if humans and be@@ es might sol@@ ve complex problems in the same way .
"R@@ e@@ ally , we wanted to know if be@@ es can also ada@@ pt themselves to new situ@@ ations using pre@@ vi@@ ously learned ru@@ les and cond@@ itions . So what if be@@ es can think like us ?"
"Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an in@@ se@@ ct with only one million brain cells ."
"But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because be@@ es , like us , can recogniz@@ e a good flo@@ wer reg@@ ar@@ dl@@ ess of the time of day , the light , the we@@ a@@ ther , or from any ang@@ le they appro@@ ach it from . ( Applause ) B@@ L : So the next step was to design an experim@@ ent , which is a game . So the kids went off and they desig@@ ned this experim@@ ent , and so — well , game — and so , A@@ my , can you tell us what the game was , and the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le that you set the be@@ es ?"
A@@ O : The pu@@ z@@ z@@ le we came up with was an i@@ f-@@ then ru@@ le .
"We asked the be@@ es to learn not just to go to a certain col@@ or , but to a certain col@@ or flo@@ wer only when it &apos;s in a certain patter@@ n ."
"They were only re@@ war@@ ded if they went to the y@@ el@@ low flo@@ wers if the y@@ el@@ low flo@@ wers were sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by the bl@@ ue , or if the bl@@ ue flo@@ wers were sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by the y@@ el@@ low ."
"Now there &apos;s a number of different ru@@ les the be@@ es can learn to sol@@ ve this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le . The interesting question is , which ?"
"What was really exc@@ iting about this project was we , and B@@ e@@ a@@ u , had no idea whether it would work ."
"It was completely new , and no one had done it before , inclu@@ ding a@@ du@@ l@@ ts . ( Laughter ) B@@ L : In@@ clu@@ ding the teach@@ ers , and that was really hard for the teach@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s easy for a sci@@ ent@@ ist to go in and not have a clu@@ e what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the la@@ b , but for a teach@@ er not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the cre@@ dit goes to D@@ ave S@@ trud@@ w@@ ick , who was the col@@ laborat@@ or on this project . O@@ kay ?"
"So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole det@@ ail@@ s of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ation . So here are some of the students doing the ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ations . They &apos;re recor@@ ding the data of where the be@@ es f@@ ly ."
( V@@ ideo ) D@@ ave S@@ trud@@ w@@ ick : So what we &apos;re going to do — S@@ tu@@ dent : 5@@ C .
D@@ ave S@@ trud@@ w@@ ick : I@@ s she still going up here ? S@@ tu@@ dent : Yeah .
"D@@ ave S@@ trud@@ w@@ ick : So you keep tra@@ ck of e@@ ach@@ .@@ S@@ tu@@ dent : H@@ en@@ ry , can you help me here ?"
"B@@ L : &quot; &quot; C@@ an you help me , H@@ en@@ ry ? &quot; &quot; What good sci@@ ent@@ ist says that , right ?"
S@@ tu@@ dent : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
B@@ L : R@@ ight ? So we &apos;ve got our ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ations . We &apos;ve got our data .
"They do the simple ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs , aver@@ ag@@ ing , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to sub@@ m@@ it this for publi@@ c@@ ation . R@@ ight ? So we have to write it up .
"So we go , of course , to the pu@@ b . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is m@@ ine , o@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a pa@@ per has four different se@@ ctions : an in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion , a me@@ th@@ od@@ s , a resul@@ ts , a disc@@ us@@ sion ."
"The in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion says , what &apos;s the question and why ?"
"M@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s , what did you do ? R@@ es@@ ul@@ ts , what was the ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ation ?"
"And the disc@@ us@@ sion is , who care@@ s ? R@@ ight ?"
"That &apos;s a science pa@@ per , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a nar@@ r@@ ative , which means that this pa@@ per is writ@@ ten in ki@@ d@@ speak ."
"It &apos;s not writ@@ ten by me . It &apos;s writ@@ ten by A@@ my and the other students in the clas@@ s . A@@ s a con@@ sequ@@ ence , this science pa@@ per beg@@ ins , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce u@@ po@@ n a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The resul@@ ts se@@ ction , it says : &quot; &quot; T@@ ra@@ ining p@@ ha@@ se , the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le ... du@@ h du@@ h du@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ? ( Laughter ) And the me@@ th@@ od@@ s , it says , &quot; &quot; Th@@ en we put the be@@ es into the fri@@ d@@ ge ( and made be@@ e pi@@ e ) , &quot; &quot; sm@@ il@@ ey face . R@@ ight ? ( Laughter ) This is a science pa@@ per . We &apos;re going to try to get it publi@@ shed ."
So here &apos;s the t@@ it@@ le p@@ age . We have a number of au@@ th@@ ors there .
All the ones in bol@@ d are e@@ ight to 10 years old .
"The first au@@ th@@ or is B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton Pri@@ mar@@ y S@@ cho@@ ol , because if it were ever re@@ fer@@ en@@ ced , it would be &quot; &quot; B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individu@@ al . So we sub@@ m@@ it it to a public acc@@ ess jour@@ nal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this ."
"&quot; &quot; I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id the pa@@ per fa@@ il@@ s our in@@ iti@@ al qu@@ ality control ch@@ ec@@ ks in sever@@ al different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it star@@ ts off &quot; &quot; once u@@ po@@ n a time , &quot; &quot; the fi@@ gu@@ res are in cra@@ y@@ on , et@@ c . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it re@@ vi@@ e@@ wed . So I s@@ ent it to D@@ ale P@@ ur@@ ves , who is at the N@@ ational A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of S@@ ci@@ ence , one of the le@@ ad@@ ing ne@@ uro@@ scientists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most orig@@ in@@ al science pa@@ per I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it cer@@ tain@@ ly des@@ er@@ ves wi@@ de ex@@ pos@@ ure . &quot;"
"L@@ ar@@ ry M@@ al@@ on@@ ey , ex@@ per@@ t in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The pa@@ per is mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent ."
The work would be publi@@ sh@@ able if done by a@@ du@@ l@@ ts . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We sen@@ d it back to the ed@@ it@@ or .
They say no .
"So we asked L@@ ar@@ ry and N@@ at@@ ali@@ e H@@ em@@ pe@@ l to write a com@@ men@@ t@@ ary situ@@ ating the fin@@ din@@ gs for scientists , right , put@@ ting in the re@@ fer@@ ences , and we sub@@ m@@ it it to Bi@@ olog@@ y L@@ et@@ ters ."
"And there , it was re@@ vi@@ e@@ wed by five inde@@ pen@@ dent re@@ f@@ ere@@ es , and it was publi@@ shed . O@@ kay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it publi@@ shed . ( Laughter ) T@@ y@@ p@@ ical science , actually , right ? So this makes A@@ my and her friends the youn@@ g@@ est publi@@ shed scientists in the world ."
What was the fe@@ ed@@ back like ?
"Well , it was publi@@ shed two days before Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed 3@@ 0,000 times in the first day , right ?"
"It was the E@@ dit@@ ors &apos; C@@ ho@@ ice in S@@ ci@@ ence , which is a top science magaz@@ ine ."
It &apos;s fore@@ ver fre@@ ely acc@@ es@@ sible by Bi@@ olog@@ y L@@ et@@ ters .
It &apos;s the only pa@@ per that will ever be fre@@ ely acc@@ es@@ sible by this jour@@ nal .
"L@@ ast year , it was the secon@@ d-@@ most do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed pa@@ per by Bi@@ olog@@ y L@@ et@@ ters , and the fe@@ ed@@ back from not just scientists and teach@@ ers but the public as well ."
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; &quot; I have read &apos; B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton B@@ e@@ es &apos; rec@@ ently . I don &apos;t have words to expla@@ in exactly how I am feel@@ ing right now .
"What you guys have done is real , true and amazing ."
"C@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , inter@@ est , in@@ no@@ c@@ ence and z@@ e@@ al are the most ba@@ sic and most important things to do science ."
Wh@@ o else can have these qu@@ al@@ ities more than children ?
P@@ le@@ ase con@@ g@@ rat@@ ul@@ ate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to con@@ clu@@ de with a physi@@ cal met@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
"C@@ an I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , come on . Yeah ye@@ ah . O@@ kay ."
"Now , science is about taking ri@@ sk@@ s , so this is an incredi@@ ble risk , right ? ( Laughter ) F@@ or me , not for him . R@@ ight ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?"
"S@@ hi@@ mon S@@ ch@@ oc@@ k@@ en : R@@ ight , but I like myself ."
B@@ L : This is the ep@@ it@@ ome of technology . R@@ ight . O@@ kay .
"Now ... ( Laughter ) O@@ kay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demon@@ str@@ ation , right ?"
"You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me c@@ la@@ pp@@ ing . All right ?"
"( C@@ la@@ pp@@ ing ) ( C@@ la@@ pp@@ ing ) O@@ kay , how about if everyone over there sh@@ ou@@ ts . One , two , three ?"
"A@@ udi@@ ence : ( Sh@@ ou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) ( Sh@@ ou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) B@@ r@@ illi@@ ant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one over there sh@@ out . ( Sh@@ ou@@ ts ) Wh@@ ere &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
"R@@ ight ? We norm@@ ally walk through life respon@@ ding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty . Wh@@ en he op@@ en@@ ed his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way ."
"That &apos;s what science off@@ ers us . It off@@ ers the pos@@ sibil@@ ity to step on un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty through the process of play , right ?"
"Now , true science education I think should be about gi@@ ving people a vo@@ ice and en@@ ab@@ ling to ex@@ pres@@ s that vo@@ ice , so I &apos;ve asked A@@ my to be the last vo@@ ice in this shor@@ t story ."
"So , A@@ my ?"
"A@@ O : This project was really exc@@ iting for me , because it b@@ rou@@ ght the process of discover@@ y to life , and it sho@@ wed me that any@@ one , and I mean any@@ one , has the pot@@ ential to disc@@ over something new , and that a small question can le@@ ad into a big discover@@ y ."
Ch@@ ang@@ ing the way a person thin@@ ks about something can be easy or hard . It all de@@ pen@@ ds on the way the person feel@@ s about change .
"But chang@@ ing the way I thought about science was surpri@@ sing@@ ly easy . O@@ n@@ ce we pla@@ yed the g@@ am@@ es and then started to think about the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a bor@@ ing sub@@ ject , and that any@@ one can disc@@ over something new ."
"You just need an opport@@ unity . My opport@@ unity came in the form of B@@ e@@ a@@ u , and the B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton B@@ ee Pro@@ ject ."
Thank y@@ ou@@ .@@ B@@ L : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the bi@@ gg@@ est problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The S@@ k@@ ep@@ ti@@ cal En@@ vi@@ ron@@ men@@ tal@@ ist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good cho@@ ice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
"And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out p@@ en and pa@@ per because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that ."
So get out your p@@ en and pa@@ per .
"B@@ ot@@ tom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world ."
I &apos;m just going to li@@ st some of them .
There are 8@@ 00 million people star@@ ving .
There &apos;s a billion people without cle@@ an d@@ rin@@ king water .
T@@ w@@ o billion people without san@@ it@@ ation .
There are sever@@ al million people d@@ ying of H@@ I@@ V and A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
The li@@ sts go on and on .
There &apos;s two bil@@ li@@ ons of people who will be sever@@ ely aff@@ ec@@ ted by clim@@ ate change — so on .
"There are many , many problems out there ."
"In an ide@@ al world , we would sol@@ ve them all , but we don &apos;t ."
We don &apos;t actually sol@@ ve all problems .
"And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy s@@ es@@ sion — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start as@@ king ourselves , which ones should we sol@@ ve first ?"
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
"If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?"
"We id@@ enti@@ fi@@ ed 10 of the bi@@ gg@@ est chall@@ eng@@ es in the world , and I will just bri@@ ef@@ ly read them : clim@@ ate change , communic@@ able dise@@ ases , conf@@ lic@@ ts , education , finan@@ cial inst@@ ability , govern@@ ance and cor@@ rup@@ tion , mal@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition and hun@@ ger , population mi@@ gr@@ ation , san@@ it@@ ation and water , and sub@@ si@@ di@@ es and tra@@ de bar@@ ri@@ ers ."
We believe that these in many ways en@@ comp@@ as@@ s the bi@@ gg@@ est problems in the world .
"The obvi@@ ous question would be to ask , what do you think are the bi@@ gg@@ est things ?"
Wh@@ ere should we start on sol@@ ving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in Dav@@ os in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
"But of course , there &apos;s a problem in as@@ king people to foc@@ us on problems ."
Because we can &apos;t sol@@ ve problems .
Su@@ rely the bi@@ gg@@ est problem we have in the world is that we all die .
"But we don &apos;t have a technology to sol@@ ve that , right ?"
"So the point is not to pri@@ or@@ it@@ ize problems , but the point is to pri@@ or@@ it@@ ize sol@@ utions to problems ."
And that would be — of course that gets a little more comp@@ lic@@ ated .
T@@ o clim@@ ate change that would be like K@@ y@@ o@@ to .
"To communic@@ able dise@@ ases , it might be health cl@@ in@@ ics or mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to n@@ ets ."
"To conf@@ lic@@ ts , it would be U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s pe@@ ac@@ ek@@ e@@ ep@@ ing for@@ ces , and so on ."
"The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 secon@@ ds — and I know this is in a sense an im@@ possible ta@@ s@@ k — write down what you think is probably some of the top pri@@ or@@ ities ."
"And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where econo@@ m@@ ics gets e@@ vil — to put down what are the things we should not do , first ."
What should be at the bot@@ tom of the li@@ st ?
"P@@ le@@ ase , just take 30 secon@@ ds , perhaps talk to your ne@@ igh@@ bor , and just figure out what should be the top pri@@ or@@ ities and the bot@@ tom pri@@ or@@ ities of the sol@@ utions that we have to the world &apos;s bi@@ gg@@ est issu@@ es ."
"The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ al amount of my time , right ?"
"I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did ."
"And I also stron@@ g@@ ly en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these disc@@ us@@ sions af@@ ter@@ wards , to think about , how do we actually pri@@ or@@ it@@ ize ?"
"O@@ f course , you have to ask y@@ ourself , why on Earth was such a li@@ st never done before ?"
And one reason is that pri@@ or@@ it@@ iz@@ ation is incredi@@ bly un@@ com@@ for@@ table .
N@@ ob@@ ody wan@@ ts to do this .
"O@@ f course , every organiz@@ ation would love to be on the top of such a li@@ st ."
But every organiz@@ ation would also h@@ ate to be not on the top of the li@@ st .
"And since there are many more not@@ -@@ num@@ ber@@ -@@ one spo@@ ts on the li@@ st than there is number ones , it makes perf@@ ect sense not to want to do such a li@@ st ."
"We &apos;ve had the U.@@ N@@ . for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundam@@ en@@ tal li@@ st of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?"
"So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not pri@@ or@@ it@@ iz@@ ing — any deci@@ sion is a pri@@ or@@ it@@ iz@@ ation , so of course we are still pri@@ or@@ it@@ iz@@ ing , if only imp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly — and that &apos;s un@@ lik@@ ely to be as good as if we actually did the pri@@ or@@ it@@ iz@@ ation , and went in and tal@@ ked about it ."
"So what I &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situ@@ ation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of cho@@ ices ."
"There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the pri@@ ces , no@@ r the si@@ z@@ es ."
We have not had an idea .
"I@@ mag@@ ine going into a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant and getting this big men@@ u c@@ ard , but you have no idea what the pri@@ ce is ."
"You know , you have a p@@ iz@@ za ; you &apos;ve no idea what the pri@@ ce is ."
"It could be at one dolla@@ r ; it could be 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"It could be a fam@@ il@@ y-@@ size p@@ iz@@ za ; it could be a very individu@@ al@@ -@@ size p@@ iz@@ za , right ?"
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s is really trying to do — to try to put pri@@ ces on these issu@@ es .
"And so basically , this has been the C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s &apos; process ."
"We got 30 of the world &apos;s best econo@@ mi@@ sts , three in each area ."
So we have three of world &apos;s top econo@@ mi@@ sts write about clim@@ ate change .
What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the ben@@ ef@@ it of that ?
Li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se in communic@@ able dise@@ ases .
"Th@@ ree of the world &apos;s top ex@@ per@@ ts saying , what can we do ?"
What would be the pri@@ ce ?
"What should we do about it , and what will be the out@@ come ?"
And so on .
"Th@@ en we had some of the world &apos;s top econo@@ mi@@ sts , e@@ ight of the world &apos;s top econo@@ mi@@ sts , inclu@@ ding three N@@ ob@@ el L@@ au@@ re@@ ates , me@@ et in C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en in M@@ ay 200@@ 4 ."
We called them the &quot; &quot; dre@@ am team . &quot; &quot; The C@@ am@@ bri@@ d@@ ge Uni@@ vers@@ ity pre@@ f@@ ec@@ ts decided to call them the Re@@ al M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d of econo@@ m@@ ics .
"That works very well in Euro@@ pe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here ."
And what they basically did was come out with a pri@@ or@@ it@@ iz@@ ed li@@ st .
"And then you ask , why econo@@ mi@@ sts ?"
"And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question ."
"The point is , of course , if you want to know about mal@@ ari@@ a , you ask a mal@@ ari@@ a ex@@ per@@ t ."
"If you want to know about clim@@ ate , you ask a c@@ li@@ mat@@ olog@@ ist ."
"But if you want to know which of the two you should de@@ al with first , you can &apos;t ask ei@@ ther of them , because that &apos;s not what they do ."
That is what econo@@ mi@@ sts do .
They pri@@ or@@ it@@ ize .
"They make that in some ways dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing ta@@ s@@ k of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do af@@ ter@@ wards ?"
"So this is the li@@ st , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you ."
"O@@ f course , you can also see it on the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on ."
"They basically came up with a li@@ st where they said there were bad pro@@ jects — basically , pro@@ jects where if you inv@@ est a dolla@@ r , you get less than a dolla@@ r back ."
"Th@@ en there &apos;s fa@@ ir pro@@ jects , good pro@@ jects and very good pro@@ jects ."
"And of course , it &apos;s the very good pro@@ jects we should start doing ."
I &apos;m going to go from back@@ wards so that we end up with the best pro@@ jects .
These were the bad pro@@ jects .
A@@ s you might see the bot@@ tom of the li@@ st was clim@@ ate change .
"This off@@ ends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t come back , ei@@ ther ."
"And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really cu@@ ri@@ ous ."
Why is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll dis@@ ag@@ ree with on the li@@ st that you w@@ ro@@ te down .
The reason why they came up with saying that K@@ y@@ o@@ to — or doing something more than K@@ y@@ o@@ to — is a bad de@@ al is simply because it &apos;s very in@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent .
It &apos;s not saying that global war@@ ming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
"But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost ."
"What they basically show us , the aver@@ age of all m@@ ac@@ ro@@ economic model@@ s , is that K@@ y@@ o@@ to , if everyone ag@@ re@@ ed , would cost about 1@@ 50 billion dollars a year ."
That &apos;s a sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ al amount of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the global develop@@ ment a@@ id that we give the Th@@ ird Wor@@ ld every year .
Y@@ et it would do very little good .
All model@@ s show it will post@@ po@@ ne war@@ ming for about six years in 2@@ 100 .
So the guy in B@@ an@@ gla@@ des@@ h who gets a flo@@ od in 2@@ 100 can wa@@ it until 2@@ 1@@ 0@@ 6 .
"Wh@@ ich is a little good , but not very much good ."
"So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve sp@@ ent a lot of money doing a little good ."
"And just to give you a sense of re@@ fer@@ ence , the U.@@ N@@ . actually est@@ im@@ ate that for half that amount , for about 7@@ 5 billion dollars a year , we could sol@@ ve all maj@@ or ba@@ sic problems in the world ."
"We could give cle@@ an d@@ rin@@ king water , san@@ it@@ ation , ba@@ sic heal@@ th@@ care and education to every single human being on the planet ."
"So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend tw@@ ice the amount on doing very little good ?"
O@@ r half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it be@@ comes a bad project .
"It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it ."
"But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first pri@@ or@@ ity ."
"The fa@@ ir pro@@ jects — not@@ ice I &apos;m not going to com@@ ment on all these — but communic@@ able dise@@ ases , scale of ba@@ sic health ser@@ vi@@ ces — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of ba@@ sic health ser@@ vi@@ ces is a great thing ."
"It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very co@@ st@@ ly ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , what it tel@@ ls us is sud@@ den@@ ly we start thinking about both sid@@ es of the equ@@ ation ."
"If you look at the good pro@@ jects , a lot of san@@ it@@ ation and water pro@@ jects came in ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , san@@ it@@ ation and water is incredi@@ bly important , but it also co@@ sts a lot of infra@@ structure ."
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four pri@@ or@@ ities which should be at least the first ones that we de@@ al with when we talk about how we should de@@ al with the problems in the world .
The f@@ our@@ th best problem is mal@@ ari@@ a — de@@ al@@ ing with mal@@ ari@@ a .
The in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence of mal@@ ari@@ a is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get inf@@ ec@@ ted every year .
It might even cost up to@@ wards a perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge point of G@@ D@@ P every year for aff@@ ec@@ ted n@@ ations .
"If we invest@@ ed about 1@@ 3 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence down to half ."
"We could av@@ o@@ id about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 people d@@ ying , but perhaps more import@@ an@@ tly , we could av@@ o@@ id about a &#91; million &#93; people getting inf@@ ec@@ ted every year ."
"We would sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly incre@@ ase their ability to de@@ al with many of the other problems that they have to de@@ al with — of course , in the long run , also to de@@ al with global war@@ ming ."
This third best one was free tra@@ de .
"B@@ a@@ sically , the model sho@@ wed that if we could get free tra@@ de , and es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally c@@ ut sub@@ si@@ di@@ es in the U.@@ S. and Euro@@ pe , we could basically en@@ li@@ ven the global economy to an ast@@ oun@@ ding number of about 2@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 billion dollars a year , half of which would acc@@ ru@@ e to the Th@@ ird Wor@@ ld ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , the point is to say that we could actually pul@@ l two to three hun@@ d@@ red million people out of pover@@ ty , very radi@@ cally f@@ ast , in about two to five years ."
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to foc@@ us on mal@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition .
"N@@ ot just mal@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition in gener@@ al , but there &apos;s a very che@@ a@@ p way of de@@ al@@ ing with mal@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition , na@@ m@@ ely , the l@@ ack of micro@@ nu@@ tri@@ ents ."
"B@@ a@@ sically , about half of the world &apos;s population is l@@ ac@@ king in i@@ ro@@ n , z@@ in@@ c , i@@ od@@ ine and v@@ it@@ am@@ in A@@ ."
"If we inv@@ est about 12 billion dollars , we could make a se@@ v@@ ere in@@ ro@@ ad into that problem ."
That would be the second best invest@@ ment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to foc@@ us on H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
"B@@ a@@ sically , if we inv@@ est 2@@ 7 billion dollars over the next e@@ ight years , we could av@@ o@@ id 2@@ 8 new million c@@ ases of H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , what this does and what it foc@@ us@@ es on is saying there are two very different ways that we can de@@ al with H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S ."
One is tre@@ at@@ ment ; the other one is prev@@ en@@ tion .
"And again , in an ide@@ al world , we would do both ."
"But in a world where we don &apos;t do ei@@ ther , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we inv@@ est first ."
"And tre@@ at@@ ment is much , much more ex@@ pen@@ sive than prev@@ en@@ tion ."
"So basically , what this foc@@ us@@ es on is saying , we can do a lot more by invest@@ ing in prev@@ en@@ tion ."
"B@@ a@@ sically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in tre@@ at@@ ment , and 10 times as much good in prev@@ en@@ tion ."
"So again , what we foc@@ us on is prev@@ en@@ tion rather than tre@@ at@@ ment , at first rate ."
What this really does is that it makes us think about our pri@@ or@@ ities .
"I &apos;d like to have you look at your pri@@ or@@ ity li@@ st and say , did you get it right ?"
O@@ r did you get close to what we came up with here ?
"Well , of course , one of the things is clim@@ ate change again ."
"I find a lot of people find it very , very un@@ lik@@ ely that we should do that ."
"We should also do clim@@ ate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem ."
"But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems ."
There are many problems out there in the world .
"And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually foc@@ us on problems , that we foc@@ us on the right ones ."
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
"And I think , actually — Th@@ om@@ as S@@ chel@@ ling , one of the parti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts in the dre@@ am team , he put it very , very well ."
"One of things that people for@@ get , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the clim@@ ate change imp@@ ac@@ ts will be , people will be much , much ri@@ ch@@ er ."
E@@ ven the most pes@@ si@@ mi@@ st@@ ic imp@@ act sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os of the U.@@ N@@ .
est@@ im@@ ate that the aver@@ age person in the develop@@ ing world in 2@@ 100 will be about as ri@@ ch as we are today .
"M@@ u@@ ch more lik@@ ely , they will be two to four times ri@@ ch@@ er than we are ."
"And of course , we &apos;ll be even ri@@ ch@@ er than that ."
"But the point is to say , when we talk about sav@@ ing people , or hel@@ ping people in B@@ an@@ gla@@ des@@ h in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a po@@ or B@@ an@@ gla@@ de@@ sh@@ i ."
We &apos;re actually talking about a fa@@ ir@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ ut@@ ch guy .
"And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money hel@@ ping a little , 100 years from now , a fa@@ ir@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ ut@@ ch guy ?"
"O@@ r do we want to help real po@@ or people , right now , in B@@ an@@ gla@@ des@@ h , who really need the help , and wh@@ om we can help very , very che@@ a@@ ply ?"
"O@@ r as S@@ chel@@ ling put it , imagine if you were a ri@@ ch — as you will be — a ri@@ ch Ch@@ in@@ ese , a ri@@ ch B@@ ol@@ i@@ vi@@ an , a ri@@ ch Con@@ gol@@ ese , in 2@@ 100 , thinking back on 200@@ 5 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How od@@ d that they ca@@ red so much about hel@@ ping me a little bit through clim@@ ate change , and ca@@ red so fa@@ ir@@ ly little about hel@@ ping my gran@@ d@@ father and my great gran@@ d@@ father , wh@@ om they could have hel@@ ped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our pri@@ or@@ ities stra@@ ight ."
E@@ ven if it doesn &apos;t ac@@ cor@@ d to the ty@@ p@@ ical way we see this problem .
"O@@ f course , that &apos;s ma@@ in@@ ly because clim@@ ate change has good pic@@ tures ."
"We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The D@@ ay A@@ f@@ ter T@@ om@@ or@@ row &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?"
"It &apos;s a good fil@@ m in the sense that I cer@@ tain@@ ly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expe@@ ct E@@ m@@ mer@@ ich to c@@ ast B@@ ra@@ d P@@ it@@ t in his next mo@@ vie di@@ gg@@ ing l@@ at@@ rin@@ es in T@@ an@@ z@@ ani@@ a or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a mo@@ vie ."
"So in many ways , I think of the C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s and the whole disc@@ us@@ sion of pri@@ or@@ ities as a def@@ en@@ se for bor@@ ing problems ."
T@@ o make sure that we realiz@@ e it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
"It &apos;s not about making things that have the most medi@@ a atten@@ tion , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good ."
"The other ob@@ jec@@ tions , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m some@@ how — or we are some@@ how — pos@@ iting a f@@ al@@ se cho@@ ice ."
"O@@ f course , we should do all things , in an ide@@ al world — I would cer@@ tain@@ ly ag@@ ree ."
"I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t ."
"In 19@@ 70 , the develop@@ ed world decided we were going to spend tw@@ ice as much as we did , right now , than in 19@@ 70 , on the develop@@ ing world ."
S@@ in@@ ce then our a@@ id has hal@@ ved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the pat@@ h of sud@@ den@@ ly sol@@ ving all big problems .
"L@@ i@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , people are also saying , but what about the I@@ ra@@ q war ?"
"You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?"
I &apos;m all for that .
"If any one of you guys can talk B@@ us@@ h into doing that , that &apos;s f@@ ine ."
"But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?"
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right pri@@ or@@ ities .
"I should just men@@ tion bri@@ ef@@ ly , is this really the right li@@ st that we got out ?"
"You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best econo@@ mi@@ sts , you in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably end up as@@ king old , white American men ."
"And they &apos;re not ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world ."
So we actually inv@@ ited 80 young people from all over the world to come and sol@@ ve the same problem .
"The only two re@@ qui@@ remen@@ ts were that they were stud@@ ying at the univers@@ ity , and they spo@@ ke En@@ gli@@ sh ."
"The maj@@ or@@ ity of them were , first , from develop@@ ing countries ."
"They had all the same material but they could go va@@ st@@ ly outside the sc@@ op@@ e of disc@@ us@@ sion , and they cer@@ tain@@ ly did , to come up with their own li@@ sts ."
And the surpri@@ sing thing was that the li@@ st was very si@@ mil@@ ar — with mal@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition and dise@@ ases at the top and clim@@ ate change at the bot@@ tom .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
"There &apos;s been many other se@@ min@@ ar@@ s and univers@@ ity students , and different things ."
They all come out with very much the same li@@ st .
"And that gi@@ ves me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a pat@@ h a@@ head to get us to start thinking about pri@@ or@@ ities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?"
"O@@ f course , in an ide@@ al world , again we &apos;d love to do everything ."
"But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?"
I see the C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s as a process .
"We did it in 200@@ 4 , and we hope to as@@ sem@@ ble many more people , getting much better information for 200@@ 8 , 20@@ 12 ."
Ma@@ p out the right pat@@ h for the world — but also to start thinking about polit@@ ical tri@@ age .
"To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; A@@ t the end of the day , you can dis@@ ag@@ ree with the disc@@ us@@ sion of how we actually pri@@ or@@ it@@ ize these , but we have to be h@@ on@@ est and f@@ ran@@ k about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do ."
"If we wor@@ ry too much about some things , we end by not wor@@ ry@@ ing about other things ."
"So I hope this will help us make better pri@@ or@@ ities , and think about how we better work for the world ."
Thank you .
The year is 1@@ 8@@ 00 .
A cu@@ ri@@ ous little inv@@ en@@ tion is being tal@@ ked about .
It &apos;s called a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e .
What it allo@@ ws you to do is see tiny little li@@ fe@@ form@@ s that are in@@ vi@@ sible to the na@@ ked e@@ ye .
So@@ on comes the medi@@ cal discover@@ y that many of these li@@ fe@@ form@@ s are actually cau@@ ses of ter@@ ri@@ ble human dise@@ ases .
"I@@ mag@@ ine what happened to the society when they realized that an En@@ gli@@ sh mom in her te@@ ac@@ up actually was d@@ rin@@ king a mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p , not very far from here . This is from Lon@@ don ."
F@@ ast for@@ ward 2@@ 00 years .
"We still have this mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p around , and it &apos;s taken h@@ old in the develop@@ ing countries around the tro@@ p@@ ical bel@@ t ."
"@@ Ju@@ st for mal@@ ari@@ a itself , there are a million de@@ a@@ ths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be test@@ ed because they are at risk for different species of mal@@ ari@@ al inf@@ ec@@ tions ."
Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these mon@@ st@@ ers .
"You take a sta@@ in , like ac@@ ri@@ d@@ ine or@@ an@@ ge or a f@@ lu@@ o@@ res@@ c@@ ent sta@@ in or G@@ i@@ em@@ sa , and a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e , and you look at them ."
They all have fac@@ es .
"Wh@@ y is that so , that A@@ le@@ x in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , F@@ at@@ im@@ a in B@@ an@@ gla@@ des@@ h , N@@ av@@ jo@@ ot in M@@ um@@ ba@@ i , and Ju@@ li@@ e and M@@ ary in U@@ gan@@ da still wa@@ it months to be able to diag@@ no@@ se why they are si@@ ck ?"
And that &apos;s pri@@ mar@@ ily because sc@@ al@@ ability of the diag@@ nost@@ ics is completely out of re@@ ach .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem li@@ es with the micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e itself .
"E@@ ven though the p@@ in@@ na@@ cle of mo@@ der@@ n science , research micro@@ sc@@ op@@ es are not desig@@ ned for fiel@@ d test@@ ing ."
N@@ ei@@ ther were they first desig@@ ned for diag@@ nost@@ ics at all .
"They are he@@ av@@ y , bu@@ l@@ k@@ y , really hard to ma@@ in@@ tain , and cost a lot of money ."
This picture is Ma@@ h@@ at@@ ma G@@ an@@ d@@ h@@ i in the &apos; 4@@ 0s using the ex@@ act same set@@ up that we actually use today for diag@@ no@@ sing T@@ .@@ B@@ . in his ash@@ ra@@ m in Se@@ va@@ gra@@ m in India .
"T@@ w@@ o of my students , J@@ im and J@@ am@@ es , trav@@ el@@ ed around India and Th@@ ail@@ and , star@@ ting to think about this problem a lot ."
We saw all kinds of don@@ ated equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment .
We saw fun@@ g@@ us gro@@ wing on micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e len@@ ses .
And we saw people who had a fun@@ cti@@ onal micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
What gre@@ w out of that work and that tri@@ p was actually the idea of what we call F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es .
So what is a F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ e ?
"A F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ e is a completely fun@@ cti@@ onal micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e , a plat@@ form for f@@ lu@@ o@@ res@@ c@@ ence , bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ fiel@@ d , pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation , pro@@ jec@@ tion , all kinds of adv@@ an@@ ced micro@@ sc@@ op@@ y built pu@@ rely by fol@@ ding pa@@ per ."
"So , now you think , how is that possible ?"
"I &apos;m going to show you some exam@@ ples here , and we will run through some of them ."
It star@@ ts with a single she@@ et of pa@@ per .
What you see here is all the possible com@@ pon@@ ents to build a fun@@ cti@@ onal bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ fiel@@ d and f@@ lu@@ o@@ res@@ c@@ ence micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e .
"So , there are three st@@ ages : There is the op@@ ti@@ cal stage , the ill@@ um@@ in@@ ation stage and the mas@@ k@@ -@@ hol@@ ding stage ."
And there are mic@@ ro op@@ ti@@ cs at the bot@@ tom that &apos;s actually em@@ bed@@ ded in the pa@@ per itself .
"What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are pla@@ ying like a to@@ y , which it is , I ta@@ b it off , and I bre@@ ak it off ."
This pa@@ per has no instru@@ ctions and no langu@@ ages .
"There is a c@@ ode , a col@@ or c@@ ode em@@ bed@@ ded , that tel@@ ls you exactly how to f@@ old that speci@@ fic micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e ."
"When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the fun@@ cti@@ on@@ al@@ ities of a stan@@ d@@ ard micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e , just like an X@@ Y stage , a place where a sam@@ ple sli@@ de could go , for example right here ."
"We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the stan@@ d@@ ard that &apos;s been op@@ tim@@ iz@@ ed for over the years , and many health work@@ ers are actually used to this ."
"So this is what changes , but the stan@@ d@@ ard sta@@ ins all re@@ ma@@ in the same for many different dise@@ ases ."
You po@@ p this in .
"There is an X@@ Y stage , and then there is a foc@@ using stage , which is a fle@@ x@@ ure me@@ chan@@ ism that &apos;s built in pa@@ per itself that allo@@ ws us to move and foc@@ us the len@@ ses by micro@@ n step@@ s ."
"So what &apos;s really interesting about this ob@@ ject , and my students h@@ ate when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this any@@ way , is these are ru@@ gg@@ ed de@@ vi@@ ces ."
I can turn it on and th@@ row it on the flo@@ or and really try to st@@ om@@ p on it .
"And they last , even though they &apos;re desig@@ ned from a very fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble material , like pa@@ per ."
"A@@ no@@ ther fu@@ n fact is , this is what we actually sen@@ d out there as a stan@@ d@@ ard diag@@ nost@@ ic to@@ ol , but here in this en@@ vel@@ op@@ e I have 30 different fol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es of different con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations all in a single fol@@ der ."
And I &apos;m going to pic@@ k one ran@@ dom@@ ly .
"This one , it turns out , is actually desig@@ ned speci@@ fic@@ ally for mal@@ ari@@ a , because it has the f@@ lu@@ o@@ res@@ c@@ ent fil@@ ters built speci@@ fic@@ ally for diag@@ no@@ sing mal@@ ari@@ a ."
So the idea of very speci@@ fic diag@@ nost@@ ic micro@@ sc@@ op@@ es comes out of this .
"So up t@@ ill now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these set@@ u@@ ps ."
"So what I would like to do is , if we could dim the li@@ ghts , ple@@ ase , it turns out fol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es are also pro@@ jec@@ tion micro@@ sc@@ op@@ es ."
"I have these two micro@@ sc@@ op@@ es that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the w@@ all — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see ."
"What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ se@@ ction of a com@@ po@@ u@@ nd e@@ ye , and when I &apos;m going to z@@ o@@ om in clo@@ s@@ er , right there , I am going through the z@@ -@@ a@@ x@@ is ."
"A@@ no@@ ther example , one of my fav@@ or@@ ite in@@ sec@@ ts , I love to h@@ ate this one , is a mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to , and you &apos;re seeing the an@@ ten@@ na of a cu@@ le@@ x pi@@ pi@@ ens ."
R@@ ight there .
All from the simple set@@ up that I actually descri@@ bed .
So my wi@@ fe has been fiel@@ d test@@ ing some of our micro@@ sc@@ op@@ es by wa@@ sh@@ ing my clo@@ th@@ es wh@@ en@@ ever I for@@ get them in the d@@ ry@@ er .
"So it turns out they &apos;re wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just f@@ lu@@ o@@ res@@ c@@ ent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this ."
This also shows you how the pro@@ jec@@ tion sc@@ op@@ e works .
You get to see the be@@ am the way it &apos;s pro@@ jec@@ ted and b@@ ent .
C@@ an we get the li@@ ghts back on again ?
"So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m ru@@ n@@ ning out of time , in terms of how much it co@@ sts for us to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture , the bi@@ gg@@ est idea was ro@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ ro@@ ll man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , so we built this out of 50 c@@ ents of parts and co@@ sts ."
"( Applause ) And what this allo@@ ws us to do is to think about a new pa@@ radi@@ g@@ m in micro@@ sc@@ op@@ y , which we call u@@ se@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ th@@ row micro@@ sc@@ op@@ y ."
I &apos;m going to give you a qu@@ ick s@@ na@@ p@@ sh@@ ot of some of the parts that go in .
Here is a she@@ et of pa@@ per .
This is when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A@@ 4 she@@ et of pa@@ per .
These are the three st@@ ages that you actually see .
"And the op@@ ti@@ cal com@@ pon@@ ents , if you look at the in@@ set up on the right , we had to figure out a way to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture len@@ ses in pa@@ per itself at really high throu@@ gh@@ put@@ s , so it us@@ es a process of self-@@ as@@ sem@@ bly and surface ten@@ sion to build ach@@ rom@@ atic len@@ ses in the pa@@ per itself ."
So that &apos;s where the len@@ ses go .

"So even though this looks like a simple to@@ y , the as@@ pe@@ c@@ ts of engine@@ ering that go in something like this are fa@@ ir@@ ly so@@ ph@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated ."

"There it is , and it survi@@ ves ."

We are star@@ ting at the end of the sum@@ mer .
We are at a stage where we &apos;ll be making thousands of micro@@ sc@@ op@@ es .

O@@ ur world has many super@@ her@@ o@@ es .
And this is how I first met these mar@@ g@@ in@@ aliz@@ ed super@@ her@@ o@@ es .
"But at this time , gi@@ ving vo@@ ice to the cat@@ a@@ do@@ res ."
"So , the thing is , I pl@@ un@@ g@@ ed into this universe and have not sto@@ pped working since ."
"And then I realized that cat@@ a@@ do@@ res , in their in@@ vi@@ sibil@@ ity , are not exc@@ lu@@ sive to B@@ raz@@ il ."
"I met them in Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ ina , Ch@@ ile , B@@ ol@@ i@@ vi@@ a , S@@ outh Africa , T@@ ur@@ key and even in develop@@ ed countries such as the United States and J@@ ap@@ an ."
( Applause ) .
"C@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res are as@@ sist@@ ed by w@@ ell@@ -@@ being profes@@ sion@@ als and heal@@ th@@ care , like physi@@ ci@@ ans , d@@ enti@@ sts , po@@ di@@ atri@@ sts , ha@@ ir st@@ y@@ li@@ sts , mas@@ sage ther@@ ap@@ ist@@ s and much more ."
"Th@@ en , finally , pain@@ ted by a stre@@ et art@@ ist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mobil@@ e art ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition ."

"A@@ b@@ out a year and a half ago , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en L@@ aw@@ l@@ er , who also gave a talk here at TED in 200@@ 7 on V@@ ir@@ tual Earth , b@@ rou@@ ght me over to become the ar@@ chit@@ ect of B@@ ing M@@ ap@@ s , which is M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft &apos;s on@@ lin@@ e-@@ ma@@ pp@@ ing ef@@ for@@ t ."
"In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing the way ma@@ ps work on@@ line ."
And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of ma@@ pp@@ ing and direc@@ tion s@@ ite that one is used to .
"So , the first thing that you might not@@ ice about the ma@@ pp@@ ing s@@ ite is just the f@@ lu@@ id@@ ity of the z@@ o@@ om@@ ing and the pan@@ ning , which , if you &apos;re famili@@ ar at all with Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , that &apos;s where it comes from ."
"M@@ app@@ ing is , of course , not just about car@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ y , it &apos;s also about imag@@ ery ."
"So , as we z@@ o@@ om@@ -@@ in be@@ y@@ ond a certain level this re@@ sol@@ ves into a kind of S@@ im C@@ it@@ y-@@ like vir@@ tual view at 4@@ 5 de@@ gre@@ es ."
"This can be vi@@ e@@ wed from any of the car@@ din@@ al direc@@ tions to show you the 3@@ D structure of the city , all the fac@@ ad@@ es ."
"Now , we see this space , this thre@@ e-@@ d@@ imen@@ si@@ onal environment , as being a can@@ vas on which all sor@@ ts of app@@ lic@@ ations can play out , and ma@@ p &apos;s direc@@ tions are really just one of them ."
"If you c@@ li@@ ck on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve lau@@ n@@ ched ."
"So , for example , a couple of days after the dis@@ aster in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , we had an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke ma@@ p that sho@@ wed before and after pic@@ tures from the sk@@ y ."
"This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hy@@ per@@ -@@ local blo@@ gs in real time and ma@@ pp@@ ing those stories , those ent@@ ri@@ es to the places that are re@@ fer@@ red to on the blo@@ gs ."
It &apos;s wonderful .
But I &apos;m going to show you some more can@@ dy sort of stuff .
"So , we see the imag@@ ery , of course , not sto@@ pp@@ ing at the sk@@ y ."
These little gre@@ en bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es re@@ present ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ ths that us@@ ers have made .
"I &apos;m not going to di@@ ve into them ei@@ ther , but ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ ths are in@@ te@@ g@@ rat@@ ed into the ma@@ p ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing that &apos;s c@@ as@@ ed in bl@@ ue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imag@@ ery on the ground as well .
"And so , when you f@@ ly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . Wh@@ en you f@@ ly down to the ground , and you see this kind of pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ery , the first thing that you might not@@ ice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much thre@@ e-@@ d@@ imen@@ si@@ onal under@@ standing of this environment as there is of the thre@@ e-@@ d@@ imen@@ si@@ onal city from ab@@ ov@@ e , so if I c@@ li@@ ck on something to get a clo@@ s@@ er view of it , then , the fact that that trans@@ ition looks as it does , is a fun@@ ction of all of that ge@@ omet@@ ry , all of that 3@@ D under@@ standing behind this model ."
"Now , I &apos;ll show you a fu@@ n ap@@ p that — we &apos;ve been working on a col@@ labor@@ ation with our friends at F@@ lic@@ k@@ r ."
"This takes F@@ lic@@ k@@ r , ge@@ o@@ regi@@ ster@@ ed imag@@ ery and us@@ es ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ -@@ like proc@@ ess@@ es to conne@@ ct that imag@@ ery to our imag@@ ery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually me@@ ant to pul@@ l up , but — ( Laughter ) But not@@ ice — this is , of course , a popul@@ ar tou@@ ri@@ st s@@ ite , and there are lots of ph@@ ot@@ os around here , and these ph@@ ot@@ os are all taken at different times ."
So this one was taken around five .
"So that &apos;s the F@@ lic@@ k@@ r p@@ ho@@ to , that &apos;s our imag@@ ery ."
"So you really see how this kind of c@@ ro@@ w@@ d-@@ sour@@ ced imag@@ ery is in@@ te@@ g@@ rat@@ ing , in a very de@@ ep way , into the ma@@ p itself ."
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"There are sever@@ al reas@@ ons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time trav@@ el ."
"And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful h@@ istori@@ c imag@@ ery in here , but there are some with hor@@ ses and car@@ ri@@ ages and so on as well ."
"But what &apos;s co@@ ol about this is that , not only is it au@@ g@@ men@@ ting this vis@@ ual re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of the world with things that are coming in from us@@ ers , but it also is the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be sho@@ wing you more of in just a moment ."
Now I just made a trans@@ ition in@@ do@@ ors . That &apos;s also interesting .
"O@@ K , not@@ ice there &apos;s now a ro@@ of ab@@ ov@@ e us ."
We &apos;re inside the P@@ ike P@@ l@@ ace Mar@@ k@@ et .

"And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sor@@ ts of regi@@ str@@ ation , not only of still images , but also of video ."
"So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , tru@@ ly , very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) OK .
"( R@@ ing@@ ing ) All right , guys , are you there ?"
( N@@ o@@ ise ) All right . I &apos;m hit@@ ting it . I &apos;m p@@ un@@ ching play .
I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
"So , these are our friends in P@@ ike P@@ l@@ ace Mar@@ k@@ et , the la@@ b ."
( Applause ) So they &apos;re bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ing this live .
"O@@ K , G@@ e@@ or@@ ge , can you p@@ an back over to the cor@@ ner market ?"
Because I want to show poin@@ ts of inter@@ est .
"No , no . The other way ."
"@@ Yeah , ye@@ ah , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
"O@@ K , OK , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
"O@@ K , never mind ."
"What I wanted to show you was these poin@@ ts of inter@@ est over here on top of the image because what that gi@@ ves you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spo@@ t , you can think about this — this is taking a step in add@@ ition to au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality ."
"What the h@@ ell are you guys — o@@ h , sor@@ ry ."
"( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m han@@ ging up now ."
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is to take that real ...
"( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and th@@ ank the team ."
They &apos;ve done a fanta@@ st@@ ic job of pul@@ ling this together .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to ab@@ an@@ don them now and walk back outside .
"And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just men@@ tion that here we &apos;re using this for tele@@ pres@@ ence , but you can equ@@ ally well use this on the spo@@ t , for au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality ."
"When you use it on the spo@@ t , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that met@@ ad@@ at@@ a and information about the world to you ."
"So here , we &apos;re taking the ex@@ tr@@ a step of also bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ing it ."
"That was being bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast , by the way , on a 4@@ G net@@ work from the market ."
"A@@ ll right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft has given in the past sever@@ al years ."
"And that &apos;s C@@ ur@@ t@@ is W@@ ong , Wor@@ l@@ d@@ W@@ i@@ de T@@ el@@ es@@ c@@ op@@ e ."

This is the in@@ te@@ gr@@ ation of Wor@@ l@@ d@@ W@@ i@@ de T@@ el@@ es@@ c@@ op@@ e into our ma@@ ps .
"( Applause ) This is the cur@@ r@@ ent — th@@ ank you — this is the cur@@ r@@ ent time .

I would like to kind of z@@ o@@ om in on the mo@@ on .
"So , this is an astro@@ no@@ mic@@ ally compl@@ ete re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of the sk@@ y in@@ te@@ g@@ rat@@ ed right into the Earth ."
"A@@ ll right now , I &apos;ve over@@ run my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop ."
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
"I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back ."
And let me start with this .
"This is my bas@@ el@@ ine : This is the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ ean co@@ ast with no fish , b@@ are ro@@ ck and lots of se@@ a ur@@ ch@@ ins that like to e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing like this is what I first saw when I ju@@ mp@@ ed in the water for the first time in the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ ean co@@ ast off Spa@@ in .
"Now , if an ali@@ en came to ear@@ th — let &apos;s call him J@@ oe — what would J@@ oe see ?"
"If J@@ oe ju@@ mp@@ ed in a cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f , there are many things the ali@@ en could see ."
"V@@ ery un@@ lik@@ ely , J@@ oe would ju@@ m@@ p on a pri@@ st@@ ine cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f , a vir@@ g@@ in cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f with lots of cor@@ al , shar@@ ks , c@@ ro@@ c@@ od@@ il@@ es , man@@ at@@ e@@ es , grou@@ per@@ s , tur@@ t@@ les , et@@ c ."
"So , probably , what J@@ oe would see would be in this part , in the gre@@ en@@ ish part of the picture ."
"H@@ ere we have the ex@@ tre@@ me with de@@ ad cor@@ als , micro@@ bi@@ al s@@ ou@@ p and j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish ."
"And where the di@@ ver is , this is probably where most of the re@@ ef@@ s of the world are now , with very few cor@@ als , al@@ ga@@ e over@@ gro@@ wing the cor@@ als , lots of bacter@@ ia , and where the large animals are gone ."
And this is what most mar@@ ine scientists have seen too .
This is their bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what they think is natural because we started mo@@ der@@ n science with sc@@ u@@ ba di@@ ving long after we started de@@ gra@@ ding mar@@ ine ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ ems .
"So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like ."
"And let &apos;s start with this time machine , the L@@ ine I@@ sl@@ an@@ ds , where we have con@@ duc@@ ted a seri@@ es of N@@ ational G@@ e@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ic expe@@ d@@ itions ."
"This se@@ a is an ar@@ chi@@ p@@ el@@ ago bel@@ on@@ ging to K@@ i@@ ri@@ bat@@ i that sp@@ ans across the equ@@ ator and it has sever@@ al un@@ in@@ h@@ ab@@ ited , un@@ fi@@ shed , pri@@ st@@ ine is@@ lan@@ ds and a few in@@ h@@ ab@@ ited is@@ lan@@ ds ."
"So let &apos;s start with the first one : Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as I@@ sl@@ and , over 5@@ ,000 people ."
"Mo@@ st of the re@@ ef@@ s are de@@ ad , most of the cor@@ als are de@@ ad — over@@ gro@@ wn by al@@ ga@@ e — and most of the fish are sm@@ all@@ er than the pen@@ c@@ il@@ s we use to coun@@ t them ."
We did 2@@ 50 hours of di@@ ving here in 200@@ 5 .
We didn &apos;t see a single shar@@ k .
This is the place that C@@ ap@@ tain C@@ o@@ ok discover@@ ed in 1@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7 and he descri@@ bed a huge ab@@ un@@ dan@@ ce of shar@@ ks b@@ iting the rud@@ ders and the o@@ ar@@ s of their small bo@@ ats while they were going ash@@ ore .
Let &apos;s move the di@@ al a little bit to the past .
"F@@ an@@ ning I@@ sl@@ and , 2@@ ,@@ 500 people ."
The cor@@ als are doing better here . L@@ ots of small fish .
This is what many di@@ ver@@ s would consi@@ der pa@@ radi@@ se .
This is where you can see most of the F@@ l@@ ori@@ da K@@ e@@ ys N@@ ational Mar@@ ine S@@ an@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
"And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your bas@@ el@@ ine ."
"If we go back to a place like P@@ al@@ my@@ ra A@@ tol@@ l , where I was with J@@ ere@@ my J@@ ac@@ k@@ son a few years ago , the cor@@ als are doing better and there are shar@@ ks ."
You can see shar@@ ks in every single di@@ ve .
And this is something that is very un@@ u@@ su@@ al in today &apos;s cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s .
"But then , if we shi@@ ft the di@@ al 2@@ 00 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the cor@@ als are absol@@ ut@@ ely heal@@ thy and gor@@ ge@@ ous , form@@ ing spe@@ c@@ ta@@ cul@@ ar struc@@ tures , and where the pred@@ at@@ ors are the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 shar@@ ks per di@@ ve ."
What have we learned from these places ?
This is what we thought was natural .
This is what we call the bi@@ om@@ as@@ s py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d .
"If we get all of the fish of a cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f together and we@@ igh them , this is what we would expe@@ ct ."
"Mo@@ st of the bi@@ om@@ as@@ s is low on the food cha@@ in , the her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , the par@@ rot@@ fish , the sur@@ ge@@ on@@ fish that e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
"Th@@ en the plan@@ k@@ ton fe@@ ed@@ ers , these little dam@@ sel@@ fish , the little animals flo@@ ating in the water ."
"And then we have a lo@@ wer bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , and a lo@@ wer bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of top head , or the shar@@ ks , the large s@@ na@@ p@@ per@@ s , the large grou@@ per@@ s ."
But this is a con@@ sequ@@ ence .
This view of the world is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of having studi@@ ed de@@ gra@@ ded re@@ ef@@ s .
"When we went to pri@@ st@@ ine re@@ ef@@ s , we realized that the natural world was up@@ side down ; this py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d was in@@ ver@@ ted ."
"The top head does ac@@ coun@@ t for most of the bi@@ om@@ as@@ s , in some places up to 8@@ 5 percent , like K@@ ing@@ man Re@@ e@@ f , which is now prote@@ cted ."
"The good news is that , in add@@ ition to having more pred@@ at@@ ors , there &apos;s more of everything ."
The size of these bo@@ x@@ es is bi@@ g@@ ger .
"We have more shar@@ ks , more bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of s@@ na@@ p@@ per@@ s , more bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , too , like these par@@ ro@@ t fish that are like mar@@ ine go@@ ats ."
"They cle@@ an the re@@ e@@ f ; everything that gro@@ ws enough to be seen , they e@@ at , and they keep the re@@ e@@ f cle@@ an and al@@ low the cor@@ als to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish ."
"N@@ ot only do these places — these an@@ ci@@ ent , pri@@ st@@ ine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important com@@ pon@@ ents of the ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em like the gi@@ ant cl@@ am@@ s ; p@@ av@@ e@@ ments of gi@@ ant cl@@ am@@ s in the la@@ go@@ ons , up to 20 , 25 per squ@@ are met@@ er ."
"Th@@ ese have dis@@ appe@@ a@@ red from every in@@ h@@ ab@@ ited re@@ e@@ f in the world , and they fil@@ ter the water ; they keep the water cle@@ an from mic@@ rob@@ es and pa@@ th@@ og@@ ens ."
"But still , now we have global war@@ ming ."
"If we don &apos;t have fi@@ sh@@ ing because these re@@ ef@@ s are prote@@ cted by la@@ w or their rem@@ ot@@ en@@ ess , this is great ."
But the water gets war@@ mer for too long and the cor@@ als die .
"So how are these fish , these pred@@ at@@ ors going to help ?"
"Well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during E@@ l N@@ in@@ o , year &apos; 9@@ 7 , &apos; 9@@ 8 , the water was too war@@ m for too long , and many cor@@ als b@@ le@@ ach@@ ed and many di@@ ed ."
"In Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , where the food we@@ b is really tri@@ m@@ med down , where the large animals are gone , the cor@@ als have not rec@@ over@@ ed ."
"In F@@ an@@ ning I@@ sl@@ and , the cor@@ als are not rec@@ over@@ ed ."
But you see here a big table cor@@ al that di@@ ed and col@@ la@@ p@@ sed .
"And the fish have g@@ raz@@ ed the al@@ ga@@ e , so the tur@@ f of al@@ ga@@ e is a little lo@@ wer ."
"Th@@ en you go to P@@ al@@ my@@ ra A@@ tol@@ l that has more bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , and the de@@ ad cor@@ als are cle@@ an , and the cor@@ als are coming back ."
"And when you go to the pri@@ st@@ ine side , did this ever b@@ le@@ ach ?"
"Th@@ ese places b@@ le@@ ach@@ ed too , but they rec@@ over@@ ed f@@ aster ."
"The more in@@ ta@@ ct , the more compl@@ ete , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food we@@ b , the high@@ er the res@@ ili@@ ence , &#91; and &#93; the more lik@@ ely that the system is going to rec@@ over from the shor@@ t-@@ ter@@ m imp@@ ac@@ ts of war@@ ming ev@@ ents ."
"And that &apos;s good news , so we need to rec@@ over that structure ."
We need to make sure that all of the pi@@ ec@@ es of the ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em are there so the ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em can ada@@ pt to the effec@@ ts of global war@@ ming .
"So if we have to res@@ et the bas@@ el@@ ine , if we have to pus@@ h the ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em back to the left , how can we do it ?"
"Well , there are sever@@ al ways ."
"One very clear way is the mar@@ ine prote@@ cted are@@ as , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally no-@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves that we set a@@ side to al@@ low for the rec@@ over@@ y for mar@@ ine life ."
And let me go back to that image of the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ ean .
This was my bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what I saw when I was a ki@@ d .
"And at the same time I was wat@@ ching J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u &apos;s shows on T@@ V , with all this ri@@ ch@@ ness and ab@@ un@@ dan@@ ce and di@@ vers@@ ity ."
"And I thought that this ri@@ ch@@ ness bel@@ on@@ g@@ ed to tro@@ p@@ ical se@@ as , and that the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ ean was a nat@@ ur@@ ally po@@ or se@@ a ."
"But , little did I know , until I ju@@ mp@@ ed for the first time in a mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve ."
"And this is what I saw , lots of fish ."
"A@@ f@@ ter a few years , between five and se@@ ven years , fish come back , they e@@ at the ur@@ ch@@ ins , and then the al@@ ga@@ e grow again ."
"So you have this little al@@ g@@ al fore@@ st , and in the size of a la@@ p@@ top you can find more than 100 species of al@@ ga@@ e , mo@@ st@@ ly micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic f@@ it hun@@ dre@@ ds of species of little animals that then fe@@ ed the fish , so that the system rec@@ ov@@ ers ."
"And this particular place , the M@@ ed@@ es I@@ sl@@ an@@ ds Mar@@ ine R@@ es@@ er@@ ve , is only 9@@ 4 h@@ ec@@ ta@@ res , and it br@@ ings 6 million e@@ uro@@ s to the local economy , 20 times more than fi@@ sh@@ ing , and it re@@ pres@@ ents 8@@ 8 percent of all the tou@@ ri@@ st re@@ ven@@ ue ."
So these places not only help the ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em but also help the people who can ben@@ ef@@ it from the ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em .
So let me just give you a sum@@ mar@@ y of what no-@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves do .
"Th@@ ese places , when we prote@@ ct them , if we comp@@ are them to un@@ prote@@ cted are@@ as ne@@ ar@@ by , this is what happens ."
"The number of species incre@@ ases 2@@ 1 percent ; so if you have 1@@ ,000 species you would expe@@ ct 2@@ 00 more in a mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve ."
This is very sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ al .
"The size of organ@@ is@@ ms incre@@ ases a third , so your fish are now this big ."
"The ab@@ un@@ dan@@ ce , how many fish you have per squ@@ are met@@ er , incre@@ ases almost 1@@ 70 percent ."
"And the bi@@ om@@ as@@ s — this is the most spe@@ c@@ ta@@ cul@@ ar change — 4@@ .@@ 5 times gre@@ ater bi@@ om@@ as@@ s on aver@@ age , just after five to se@@ ven years ."
In some places up to 10 times lar@@ ger bi@@ om@@ as@@ s inside the re@@ ser@@ ves .
"So we have all these things inside the re@@ ser@@ ve that grow , and what do they do ?"
They re@@ produ@@ ce . That &apos;s population biolog@@ y 1@@ 0@@ 1 .
"If you don &apos;t k@@ ill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow lar@@ ger and they re@@ produ@@ ce a lot ."
And same thing for in@@ ver@@ te@@ b@@ rat@@ es . This is the example .
"Th@@ ese are eg@@ g c@@ ases la@@ id by a s@@ na@@ il off the co@@ ast of Ch@@ ile , and this is how many eg@@ gs they la@@ y on the bot@@ tom ."
"O@@ ut@@ side the re@@ ser@@ ve , you can@@ not even det@@ ect this ."
One point three million eg@@ gs per squ@@ are met@@ er inside the mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve where these s@@ na@@ il@@ s are very ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant .
"So these organ@@ is@@ ms re@@ produ@@ ce , the little lar@@ va@@ e ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es sp@@ ill over , they all sp@@ ill over , and then people can ben@@ ef@@ it from them outside too ."
This is in the B@@ a@@ h@@ am@@ as : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ per .
"H@@ u@@ ge ab@@ un@@ dan@@ ce of grou@@ per@@ s inside the re@@ ser@@ ve , and the clo@@ s@@ er you get to the re@@ ser@@ ve , the more fish you have ."
So the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men are cat@@ ching more .
You can see where the lim@@ its of the re@@ ser@@ ve are because you see the bo@@ ats lin@@ ed up .
"So there is sp@@ ill over ; there are ben@@ ef@@ its be@@ y@@ ond the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es of these re@@ ser@@ ves that help people around them , while at the same time the re@@ ser@@ ve is prote@@ c@@ ting the entire h@@ ab@@ it@@ at . It is building res@@ ili@@ ence ."
So what we have now — or a world without re@@ ser@@ ves — is like a de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ t where we with@@ dra@@ w all the time and we never make any de@@ pos@@ it .
R@@ es@@ er@@ ves are like sav@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts .
"We have this prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al that we don &apos;t tou@@ ch ; that produc@@ es re@@ turns , social , economic and ec@@ olog@@ ical ."
"And if we think about the incre@@ ase of bi@@ om@@ as@@ s inside the re@@ ser@@ ves , this is like com@@ po@@ u@@ nd inter@@ est ."
"T@@ w@@ o exam@@ ples , again , of how these re@@ ser@@ ves can ben@@ ef@@ it people ."
"This is how much fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men get every@@ day in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , fi@@ sh@@ ing over a seri@@ es of years , in a place where there is no prote@@ ction ; it &apos;s a fre@@ e-@@ for@@ -@@ all ."
"O@@ n@@ ce the most de@@ gra@@ ding fi@@ sh@@ ing ge@@ ar , se@@ ine n@@ ets , were re@@ mo@@ ved , the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men were cat@@ ching more ."
"If you fish less , you &apos;re actually cat@@ ching more ."
"But if we ad@@ d the no-@@ take re@@ ser@@ ve on top of that , the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men are still making more money by fi@@ sh@@ ing less around an area that is prote@@ cted ."
A@@ no@@ ther example : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ per@@ s in B@@ el@@ ize in the M@@ es@@ o@@ am@@ er@@ ic@@ an Re@@ e@@ f .
"This is grou@@ per se@@ x , and the grou@@ per@@ s ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate around the full mo@@ ons of D@@ ec@@ ember and J@@ an@@ u@@ ary for a week ."
"They used to ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate up to the ten@@ s of thousands , 3@@ 0,000 grou@@ per@@ s about this big in one h@@ ec@@ t@@ are , in one ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ation ."
"F@@ ish@@ er@@ men knew about these things ; they cau@@ ght them , and they de@@ pl@@ et@@ ed them ."
"When I went there for the first time in 20@@ 00 , there were only 3@@ ,000 grou@@ per@@ s left ."
And the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men were au@@ th@@ or@@ iz@@ ed to cat@@ ch 30 percent of the entire spa@@ w@@ ning population every year .
"So we did a simple anal@@ ys@@ is , and it doesn &apos;t take ro@@ ck@@ et science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fi@@ sh@@ ery is going to col@@ la@@ p@@ se very quickly ."
"And with the fi@@ sh@@ ery , the entire re@@ produc@@ tive ability of the species goes ex@@ tin@@ ct ."
It happened in many places around the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an .
"And they would make 4@@ ,000 dollars per year , tot@@ al , for the entire fi@@ sh@@ ery , sever@@ al fi@@ sh@@ ing bo@@ ats ."
"Now , if you do an economic anal@@ ys@@ is and project what would happen if the fish were not c@@ ut , if we b@@ rou@@ ght just 20 di@@ ver@@ s one mon@@ th per year , the re@@ ven@@ ue would be more than 20 times high@@ er and that would be su@@ sta@@ in@@ able over time ."
So how much of this do we have ?
"If this is so good , if this is such a no-@@ bra@@ in@@ er , how much of this do we have ?"
And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean &apos;s prote@@ cted .
"We &apos;re getting clo@@ s@@ er to one percent now , th@@ an@@ ks to the prote@@ ctions of the C@@ ha@@ go@@ s Ar@@ chi@@ p@@ el@@ ago , and only a fra@@ ction of this is fully prote@@ cted from fi@@ sh@@ ing ."
S@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic studi@@ es re@@ com@@ men@@ d that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be prote@@ cted .
The est@@ im@@ ated ran@@ ge is between 20 and 50 percent for a seri@@ es of go@@ als of bi@@ od@@ i@@ vers@@ ity and fi@@ sh@@ ery en@@ han@@ c@@ ement and res@@ ili@@ ence .
"Now , is this possible ? P@@ eople would ask : How much would that cost ?"
"Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are pa@@ ying now to sub@@ sid@@ ize fi@@ sh@@ ing : 3@@ 5 billion dollars per year ."
M@@ any of these sub@@ si@@ di@@ es go to dest@@ ru@@ ctive fi@@ sh@@ ing pra@@ cti@@ ces .
"Well , there are a couple est@@ im@@ ates of how much it would cost to create a net@@ work of prote@@ cted are@@ as c@@ over@@ ing 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fra@@ ction of what we are now pa@@ ying ; the government hands out to a fi@@ sh@@ ery that is col@@ la@@ p@@ sing ."
P@@ eople are lo@@ sing their j@@ ob@@ s because the fi@@ sh@@ eri@@ es are col@@ la@@ p@@ sing .
A cre@@ ation of a net@@ work of re@@ ser@@ ves would pro@@ vide direc@@ t em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment for more than a million people pl@@ us all the secon@@ d@@ ary j@@ ob@@ s and all the secon@@ d@@ ary ben@@ ef@@ its .
So how can we do that ?
"If it &apos;s so clear that these sav@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?"
And how can we re@@ ach that go@@ al ?
"Well , there are two ways of getting there ."
The tri@@ vi@@ al solution is to create really large prote@@ cted are@@ as like the C@@ ha@@ go@@ s Ar@@ chi@@ p@@ el@@ ago .
"The problem is that we can create these large re@@ ser@@ ves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conf@@ li@@ ct , where the polit@@ ical cost is really low and the economic cost is also low ."
"And a few of us , a few organiz@@ ations in this room and el@@ se@@ where are working on this ."
"But what about the re@@ st of the co@@ ast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fi@@ sh@@ ing ?"
"Well , there are three ma@@ in reas@@ ons why we don &apos;t have ten@@ s of thousands of small re@@ ser@@ ves : The first one is that people have no idea what mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ves do , and fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men t@@ end to be really , really def@@ en@@ sive when it comes to regul@@ ating or clo@@ sing an area , even if it &apos;s small ."
"Se@@ con@@ d , the govern@@ ance is not right because most co@@ ast@@ al comm@@ unities around the world don &apos;t have the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity to mon@@ it@@ or the resour@@ ces to create the re@@ ser@@ ve and en@@ for@@ ce it ."
It &apos;s a top down hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ ical structure where people wa@@ it for government ag@@ ents to come and this is not effec@@ tive . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough resour@@ ces .
"Wh@@ ich takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more re@@ ser@@ ves , is that the fun@@ ding model@@ s have been wrong ."
"N@@ G@@ O@@ s and govern@@ ments spend a lot of time and energy and resour@@ ces in a few small are@@ as , u@@ su@@ ally ."
"So mar@@ ine con@@ ser@@ v@@ ation and co@@ ast@@ al prote@@ ction has become a sin@@ k for government or ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pi@@ c money , and this is not su@@ sta@@ in@@ able ."
So the sol@@ utions are just fi@@ x@@ ing these three issu@@ es .
"F@@ i@@ rst , we need to devel@@ op a global a@@ war@@ en@@ ess cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to in@@ spi@@ re local comm@@ unities and govern@@ ments to create no-@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves that are better than what we have now ."
It &apos;s the sav@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts ver@@ su@@ s the de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ ts with no de@@ pos@@ its .
"Se@@ con@@ d , we need to re@@ design our govern@@ ance so con@@ ser@@ v@@ ation ef@@ for@@ ts can be de@@ cent@@ r@@ aliz@@ ed , so con@@ ser@@ v@@ ation ef@@ for@@ ts don &apos;t de@@ p@@ end on work from N@@ G@@ O@@ s or from government ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es and can be created by the local comm@@ unities , like it happens in the P@@ h@@ ili@@ pp@@ ines and a few other places ."
"And third , and very important , we need to devel@@ op new business model@@ s ."
The ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ py sin@@ k as the only way to create re@@ ser@@ ves is not su@@ sta@@ in@@ able .
"We really need to devel@@ op model@@ s , business model@@ s , where co@@ ast@@ al con@@ ser@@ v@@ ation is an invest@@ ment , because we already know that these mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ves pro@@ vide social , ec@@ olog@@ ical and economic ben@@ ef@@ its ."
"And I &apos;d like to fin@@ ish with one thought , which is that no one organiz@@ ation alone is going to s@@ ave the ocean ."
"There has been a lot of comp@@ et@@ ition in the past , and we need to devel@@ op a new model of part@@ ner@@ ship , tru@@ ly col@@ labor@@ ative , where we are looking for compl@@ e@@ men@@ ting , not sub@@ st@@ it@@ ut@@ ing ."
The st@@ ak@@ es are just too high to contin@@ ue the way we are going .
So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Thank you En@@ ri@@ c .
En@@ ri@@ c S@@ ala : Thank you .
C@@ A : That was a ma@@ ster@@ ful job of pul@@ ling things together .
"F@@ i@@ rst of all , your py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d , your in@@ ver@@ ted py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d , sho@@ wing 8@@ 5 percent bi@@ om@@ as@@ s in the pred@@ at@@ ors , that se@@ ems im@@ possible ."
How could 8@@ 5 percent survi@@ ve on 15 percent ?
"E@@ S : Well , imagine that you have two g@@ ear@@ s of a wat@@ ch , a big one and a small one ."
"The big one is moving very slo@@ w@@ ly , and the small one is moving f@@ ast ."
That &apos;s basically it .
"The animals at the lo@@ wer parts of the food cha@@ in , they re@@ produ@@ ce very f@@ ast ; they grow really f@@ ast ; they produ@@ ce milli@@ ons of eg@@ gs ."
"U@@ p there , you have shar@@ ks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years ."
"They re@@ produ@@ ce very slo@@ w@@ ly ; they have a s@@ low met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ism ; and , basically , they just ma@@ in@@ tain their bi@@ om@@ as@@ s ."
"So , basically , the produc@@ tion sur@@ pl@@ us of these guys down there is enough to ma@@ in@@ tain this bi@@ om@@ as@@ s that is not moving ."
They are like cap@@ ac@@ it@@ ors of the system .
C@@ A : That &apos;s very f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating .
"So , really , our picture of a food py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d is just — we have to change that completely ."
E@@ S : A@@ t least in the se@@ as .
"What we found in cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s is that the in@@ ver@@ ted py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the S@@ er@@ eng@@ eti , with five li@@ ons per w@@ il@@ de@@ be@@ est ."
"And on land , this can@@ not work ."
But at least on cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s are systems where there is a bot@@ tom com@@ pon@@ ent with structure .
We think this is univers@@ al .
But we have started stud@@ ying pri@@ st@@ ine re@@ ef@@ s only very rec@@ ently .
C@@ A : So the num@@ bers you pres@@ ented really are ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing .
You &apos;re saying we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding 3@@ 5 billion dollars now on sub@@ si@@ di@@ es .
It would only cost 1@@ 6 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as mar@@ ine prote@@ cted are@@ as that actually give new living cho@@ ices to the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men as well .
"If the world was a sm@@ ar@@ ter place , we could sol@@ ve this problem for ne@@ g@@ ative 1@@ 9 billion dollars ."
We &apos;ve got 1@@ 9 billion to spend on health care or something .
E@@ S : And then we have the under@@ -@@ per@@ form@@ ance of fi@@ sh@@ eri@@ es that is 50 billion dollars .
"So again , one of the big sol@@ utions is have the Wor@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation shi@@ f@@ ting the sub@@ si@@ di@@ es to su@@ sta@@ in@@ able pra@@ cti@@ ces ."
"C@@ A : O@@ kay , so there &apos;s a lot of exam@@ ples that I &apos;m hear@@ ing out there about en@@ ding this sub@@ si@@ di@@ es ma@@ d@@ ness ."
So th@@ ank you for those num@@ bers .
The last one &apos;s a pers@@ onal question .
"A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oc@@ e@@ ans for a long time has just been seeing this de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting wor@@ se , depres@@ sing ."
T@@ al@@ k to me about the feel@@ ing that you must have experi@@ en@@ ced of going to these pri@@ st@@ ine are@@ as and seeing things coming back .
E@@ S : It is a sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual experience .
"We go there to try to understand the ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ ems , to try to meas@@ ure or coun@@ t fish and shar@@ ks and see how these places are different from the places we know ."
"But the best feel@@ ing is this bi@@ op@@ h@@ ili@@ a that E@@ .@@ O@@ . W@@ il@@ son tal@@ ks about , where humans have this sense of a@@ we and won@@ der in front of un@@ ta@@ med nature , of ra@@ w nature ."
"And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a lar@@ ger thing or of a lar@@ ger global ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em ."
"And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could contin@@ ue doing this job ."
It would be just too depres@@ sing .
"C@@ A : Well , En@@ ri@@ c , th@@ ank you so much for shar@@ ing some of that sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual experience with us all . Thank you ."
E@@ S : Thank you very much .
"So it &apos;s 199@@ 5 , I &apos;m in colle@@ ge , and a friend and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from Pro@@ vid@@ ence , R@@ hod@@ e I@@ sl@@ and to P@@ or@@ t@@ land , O@@ reg@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ yed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ ads through state par@@ ks and national fore@@ sts — basically the lon@@ g@@ est ro@@ ute we can pos@@ si@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of S@@ outh D@@ a@@ kot@@ a , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 mil@@ es ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter I keep seeing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
My friend looks at me tot@@ ally bl@@ an@@ k@@ ly .
There &apos;s actually a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man in the front row who &apos;s doing a perf@@ ect im@@ it@@ ation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sig@@ ns we keep seeing with the Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just st@@ are@@ s at me for a few mo@@ ments , and then she cra@@ cks up , because she fi@@ gu@@ res out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight , the fam@@ ous Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter for pic@@ ni@@ c area . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years of my life thinking about situ@@ ations exactly like this — why we sometimes mis@@ understand the sig@@ ns around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ ris say , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might stri@@ ke you as a stran@@ ge care@@ er move , but it actually has one great adv@@ anta@@ ge : no job comp@@ et@@ ition ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ o@@ id thinking about being wrong , or at least to av@@ o@@ id thinking about the pos@@ sibil@@ ity that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ stra@@ ct .
We all know everybody in this room makes mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es .
"The human species , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — o@@ kay f@@ ine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beli@@ ef@@ s I h@@ old , here in the present ten@@ se , sud@@ den@@ ly all of this ab@@ stra@@ ct ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ bil@@ ity goes out the win@@ do@@ w — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the present ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family v@@ ac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and v@@ ot@@ e in the present ten@@ se .
"So effec@@ ti@@ vely , we all kind of w@@ ind up trav@@ el@@ ing through life , tra@@ pped in this little bu@@ b@@ ble of feel@@ ing very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individu@@ als , in our pers@@ onal and profes@@ si@@ onal lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us colle@@ cti@@ vely as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to con@@ vin@@ ce you that it is possible to step outside of that feel@@ ing and that if you can do so , it is the single gre@@ at@@ est mor@@ al , intel@@ le@@ c@@ tual and cre@@ ative lea@@ p you can make ."
So why do we get stu@@ ck in this feel@@ ing of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feel@@ ing of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emot@@ i@@ on@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ b@@ s down .
"E@@ m@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing . O@@ kay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ um@@ b@@ s down , em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing — th@@ ank you , these are great ans@@ wers , but they &apos;re ans@@ wers to a different question ."
You guys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to realiz@@ e you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing , it can be re@@ vel@@ at@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ ny , like my stup@@ id Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an anal@@ og@@ y .
Do you remember that L@@ o@@ ony T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ th@@ et@@ ic co@@ y@@ ot@@ e who &apos;s always chas@@ ing and never cat@@ ching a ro@@ a@@ dru@@ n@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every ep@@ is@@ ode of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e is chas@@ ing the ro@@ a@@ dru@@ n@@ ner and the ro@@ a@@ dru@@ n@@ ner ru@@ ns off a c@@ li@@ ff , which is f@@ ine — he &apos;s a bir@@ d , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e ru@@ ns off the c@@ li@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ ny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e &apos;s tot@@ ally f@@ ine too .
He just ke@@ ep@@ s ru@@ n@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and realiz@@ es that he &apos;s in mid@@ -@@ air .
That &apos;s when he f@@ all@@ s .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realiz@@ e it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ot@@ e after he &apos;s gone off the c@@ li@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in t@@ rou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on sol@@ id ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ rec@@ t something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feel@@ s like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tu@@ ral reason , why we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r bl@@ in@@ d@@ ness .
"Mo@@ st of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ nal cu@@ e to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing as well — and this one is cul@@ tu@@ ral .
Th@@ in@@ k back for a moment to ele@@ men@@ t@@ ary school .
"You &apos;re sit@@ ting there in clas@@ s , and your teach@@ er is han@@ ding back qu@@ iz pa@@ per@@ s , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not m@@ ine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the ki@@ d who got this pa@@ per ."
"It &apos;s the dum@@ b ki@@ d , the t@@ rou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er , the one who never does his hom@@ e@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ zy , ir@@ respon@@ sible d@@ im@@ w@@ its — and second of all , that the way to succ@@ e@@ ed in life is to never make any mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es ."
We learn these really bad l@@ ess@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I su@@ spe@@ ct , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally a lot of us in this room — de@@ al with them by just be@@ coming perf@@ ect little A students , perf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ist@@ s , over@@ -@@ achi@@ ever@@ s ."
"R@@ ight , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , astro@@ physi@@ c@@ ist , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ ma@@ ra@@ th@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , astro@@ physi@@ ci@@ sts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ ma@@ ra@@ th@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so f@@ ine ."
E@@ x@@ c@@ ept that then we fre@@ ak out at the pos@@ sibil@@ ity that we &apos;ve got@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ si@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel sm@@ art and respon@@ sible and vir@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el De@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ e@@ di@@ cal C@@ ent@@ er for a sur@@ ger@@ y ."
B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ ost@@ on .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing hosp@@ ital for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best hosp@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"S@@ he &apos;s an@@ es@@ th@@ et@@ iz@@ ed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — st@@ it@@ ch@@ es her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the rec@@ over@@ y room ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing se@@ ems to have gone f@@ ine .
"And she w@@ ak@@ es up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in ban@@ da@@ ges ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in ban@@ da@@ ges because the sur@@ ge@@ on has per@@ form@@ ed a maj@@ or oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the vice pre@@ sid@@ ent for health care qu@@ ality at B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el spo@@ ke about this in@@ ci@@ dent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or what@@ ever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply felt that he was on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of the pati@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tru@@ st@@ ing too much in the feel@@ ing of being on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of anything can be very dan@@ ger@@ ous ."
This inter@@ nal sense of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a reli@@ able gu@@ i@@ de to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ nal world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ing the pos@@ sibil@@ ity that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dum@@ ping 2@@ 00 million g@@ all@@ ons of oil into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or tor@@ pe@@ doing the global economy ."
So this is a huge pra@@ cti@@ cal problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Th@@ in@@ k for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beli@@ ef@@ s just perf@@ ec@@ tly re@@ fle@@ ct reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to expla@@ in all of those people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us expla@@ in those people the same way , by res@@ or@@ ting to a seri@@ es of un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ."
The first thing we u@@ su@@ ally do when someone dis@@ ag@@ re@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ig@@ no@@ ran@@ t .
"They don &apos;t have acc@@ ess to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still dis@@ ag@@ ree with us , then we move on to a second as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right pi@@ ec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and they are too mo@@ ro@@ ni@@ c to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty sm@@ art , then we move on to a third as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion : they know the tru@@ th , and they are deli@@ ber@@ ately dist@@ or@@ ting it for their own mal@@ evol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a cat@@ astro@@ p@@ he .
This atta@@ ch@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ke@@ ep@@ s us from prev@@ ent@@ ing mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es when we absol@@ ut@@ ely need to and cau@@ ses us to tre@@ at each other ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most ba@@ ff@@ ling and most tra@@ gic about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these perf@@ ec@@ tly tran@@ sl@@ u@@ c@@ ent win@@ do@@ ws and we just gaz@@ e out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to gaz@@ e out of the same win@@ do@@ w and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The mi@@ ra@@ cle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 2@@ 00 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ t@@ es said his fam@@ ous thing about &quot; &quot; I think th@@ ere@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , S@@ t@@ . A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , s@@ at down and w@@ ro@@ te &quot; &quot; F@@ allo@@ r er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r th@@ ere@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine under@@ sto@@ od that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing def@@ ect in the human system , something we can er@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ ate or over@@ come ."
It &apos;s tot@@ ally fundam@@ en@@ tal to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like G@@ od , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other animals , we are ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with trying to figure it out ."
"To me , this ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion is the sour@@ ce and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ tiv@@ ity and cre@@ ativ@@ ity ."
"L@@ ast year , for vari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found myself list@@ ening to a lot of ep@@ is@@ od@@ es of the P@@ u@@ bli@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o show This American Li@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m list@@ ening and I &apos;m list@@ ening , and at some point , I start feel@@ ing like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the c@@ raz@@ y wron@@ g@@ ness la@@ dy .
"I just imag@@ ined it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ ra G@@ l@@ as@@ s , who &apos;s the ho@@ st of the show ."
"And I men@@ tion@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ af@@ f , we jo@@ ke that every single ep@@ is@@ ode of our show has the same c@@ ry@@ p@@ to@@ -@@ them@@ e ."
"And the c@@ ry@@ p@@ to@@ -@@ them@@ e is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra G@@ l@@ as@@ s , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mo@@ ments of surpri@@ se and re@@ vers@@ al and wron@@ g@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the re@@ st of us , audi@@ ence mem@@ bers , as list@@ en@@ ers , as re@@ a@@ ders , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like pl@@ ot tw@@ ist@@ s and red her@@ r@@ ings and surpri@@ se en@@ din@@ gs .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h thought he was going to in@@ va@@ de I@@ ra@@ q , find a bu@@ n@@ ch of we@@ a@@ pon@@ s of mas@@ s dest@@ ru@@ ction , li@@ ber@@ ate the people and bring demo@@ cra@@ cy to the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ."
And something else happened instead .
"And H@@ os@@ ni Mu@@ ba@@ ra@@ k thought he was going to be the di@@ c@@ tat@@ or of E@@ g@@ y@@ pt for the re@@ st of his life , until he got too old or too si@@ ck and could pas@@ s the re@@ ig@@ ns of power on@@ to his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ we@@ e@@ the@@ art and move back to your hom@@ eto@@ wn and ra@@ ise a bu@@ n@@ ch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writ@@ ing an incredi@@ bly ner@@ dy book about a sub@@ ject everybody h@@ ates for an audi@@ ence that would never materi@@ aliz@@ e .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredi@@ ble stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and ast@@ on@@ ish@@ es us ."
"No off@@ en@@ se , but this entire con@@ fer@@ ence is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ u@@ ment to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just sp@@ ent an entire week talking about innov@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ c@@ e@@ ments and impro@@ ve@@ ments , but you know why we need all of those innov@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ c@@ e@@ ments and impro@@ ve@@ ments ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d-@@ bog@@ gl@@ ing and wor@@ l@@ d-@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TED 199@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) D@@ id@@ n &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"Wh@@ ere &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ack , Ch@@ ris ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We h@@ old another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The them@@ e of this one , as you guys have now heard se@@ ven million times , is the red@@ is@@ c@@ over@@ y of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to red@@ is@@ c@@ over won@@ der , you need to step outside of that tiny , ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed space of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the va@@ st@@ ness and compl@@ ex@@ ity and my@@ st@@ ery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
Ma@@ ybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

N@@ o@@ sa@@ ir would ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally be con@@ vi@@ cted for his invol@@ ve@@ ment in the pl@@ ot .

It wasn &apos;t until I was se@@ ven years old that our family dy@@ na@@ mic started to change .
"My father ex@@ posed me to a side of I@@ s@@ la@@ m that few people , inclu@@ ding the maj@@ or@@ ity of M@@ us@@ li@@ ms , get to see ."
"It &apos;s been my experience that when people take the time to inter@@ act with one another , it doesn &apos;t take long to realiz@@ e that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , in every religi@@ on , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge of people who h@@ old so fer@@ v@@ ently to their beli@@ ef@@ s that they feel they must use any means ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ary to make others live as they do ."
"A few months pri@@ or to his ar@@ re@@ st , he s@@ at me down and expla@@ ined that for the past few we@@ ek@@ ends , he and some friends had been going to a sho@@ ot@@ ing ran@@ ge on L@@ ong I@@ sl@@ and for tar@@ get pra@@ cti@@ ce ."
He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next mor@@ ning .
"We ar@@ ri@@ ved at C@@ al@@ ver@@ ton S@@ ho@@ ot@@ ing R@@ an@@ ge , which un@@ be@@ know@@ n@@ st to our group was being wat@@ ched by the F@@ B@@ I ."
"When it was my turn to sho@@ ot , my father hel@@ ped me h@@ old the ri@@ f@@ le to my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der and expla@@ ined how to a@@ im at the tar@@ get about 30 y@@ ar@@ ds off ."
"That day , the last bu@@ l@@ let I sh@@ ot h@@ it the small or@@ an@@ ge light that s@@ at on top of the tar@@ get and to everyone &apos;s surpri@@ se , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally m@@ ine , the entire tar@@ get bu@@ rst into fl@@ am@@ es ."
"My un@@ cle turned to the other men , and in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c said , &quot; &quot; I@@ b@@ n ab@@ u@@ h . &quot; &quot; L@@ ike father , like son ."
"They all se@@ em@@ ed to get a really big lau@@ gh out of that com@@ ment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully under@@ sto@@ od what they thought was so fun@@ ny ."
They thought they saw in me the same dest@@ ru@@ ction my father was cap@@ able of .
"Th@@ ose men would ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally be con@@ vi@@ cted of plac@@ ing a v@@ an f@@ ill@@ ed with 1@@ ,@@ 500 po@@ un@@ ds of ex@@ plo@@ si@@ ves into the sub@@ -@@ level par@@ king lot of the Wor@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de C@@ ent@@ er &apos;s Nor@@ th T@@ o@@ wer , cau@@ sing an ex@@ plo@@ sion that kill@@ ed six people and in@@ ju@@ red over 1@@ ,000 others ."
These were the men I looked up to .
"Th@@ ese were the men I called am@@ m@@ u , which means un@@ cle ."
"B@@ y the time I turned 1@@ 9 , I had already mo@@ ved 20 times in my life , and that inst@@ ability during my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od didn &apos;t really pro@@ vide an opport@@ unity to make many friends ."
"E@@ ach time I would beg@@ in to feel com@@ for@@ table around someone , it was time to p@@ ack up and move to the next to@@ wn ."
"B@@ eing the per@@ p@@ et@@ ual new face in clas@@ s , I was fre@@ qu@@ ently the tar@@ get of bu@@ l@@ li@@ es ."
"I k@@ ept my id@@ ent@@ ity a se@@ cre@@ t from my clas@@ sm@@ ates to av@@ o@@ id being tar@@ get@@ ed , but as it turns out , being the qui@@ et , chu@@ b@@ by new ki@@ d in clas@@ s was more than enough am@@ m@@ un@@ ition ."
"So for the most part , I sp@@ ent my time at home read@@ ing bo@@ oks and wat@@ ching T@@ V or pla@@ ying video g@@ am@@ es ."
"For those reas@@ ons , my social sk@@ ill@@ s were l@@ ac@@ king , to say the least , and gro@@ wing up in a bi@@ got@@ ed hou@@ se@@ h@@ old , I wasn &apos;t pre@@ pa@@ red for the real world ."
"I &apos;d been ra@@ is@@ ed to ju@@ d@@ ge people based on ar@@ b@@ it@@ ra@@ ry meas@@ u@@ remen@@ ts , like a person &apos;s ra@@ ce or religi@@ on ."
So what op@@ en@@ ed my eyes ?
One of my first experi@@ ences that chall@@ eng@@ ed this way of thinking was during the 20@@ 00 pre@@ sid@@ ential elec@@ tions .
"Th@@ rou@@ gh a colle@@ ge pre@@ p progra@@ m , I was able to take part in the N@@ ational Y@@ outh Con@@ ven@@ tion in P@@ h@@ il@@ a@@ del@@ ph@@ ia ."
"My particular group &apos;s foc@@ us was on y@@ outh viol@@ ence , and having been the vi@@ cti@@ m of bu@@ l@@ l@@ ying for most of my life , this was a sub@@ ject in which I felt particul@@ arly pas@@ sion@@ ate ."
The mem@@ bers of our group came from many different wal@@ ks of life .
"One day to@@ ward the end of the con@@ ven@@ tion , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ en@@ ded was J@@ e@@ w@@ ish ."
"Now , it had taken sever@@ al days for this det@@ a@@ il to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural ani@@ mo@@ s@@ ity between the two of us ."
"I had never had a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish friend before , and f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly I felt a sense of pri@@ de in having been able to over@@ come a bar@@ ri@@ er that for most of my life I had been led to believe was in@@ sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table ."
"A@@ no@@ ther maj@@ or tur@@ ning point came when I found a sum@@ mer job at B@@ us@@ ch G@@ ar@@ den@@ s , an am@@ u@@ se@@ ment par@@ k ."
"There , I was ex@@ posed to people from all sor@@ ts of fa@@ i@@ ths and cul@@ tures , and that experience pro@@ ved to be fundam@@ en@@ tal to the develop@@ ment of my charac@@ ter ."
"Mo@@ st of my life , I &apos;d been ta@@ u@@ ght that ho@@ mo@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ ality was a s@@ in , and by ex@@ ten@@ sion , that all g@@ ay people were a ne@@ g@@ ative inf@@ lu@@ ence ."
"As chan@@ ce would have it , I had the opport@@ unity to work with some of the g@@ ay per@@ for@@ mer@@ s at a show there , and so@@ on found that many were the kin@@ d@@ est , least ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental people I had ever met ."
"B@@ eing bu@@ l@@ li@@ ed as a ki@@ d created a sense of em@@ pa@@ thy in me to@@ ward the su@@ ff@@ ering of others , and it comes very un@@ nat@@ ur@@ ally to me to tre@@ at people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be tre@@ ated ."
"Because of that feel@@ ing , I was able to con@@ tra@@ st the st@@ ere@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es I &apos;d been ta@@ u@@ ght as a child with real life experience and inter@@ action ."
"I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be g@@ ay , but I &apos;m well ac@@ qu@@ a@@ in@@ ted with being ju@@ d@@ g@@ ed for something that &apos;s be@@ y@@ ond my control ."
"Th@@ en there was &quot; &quot; The D@@ a@@ ily S@@ how . &quot; &quot; On a ni@@ gh@@ tly bas@@ is , J@@ on S@@ te@@ war@@ t for@@ ced me to be intel@@ le@@ c@@ tually h@@ on@@ est with myself about my own bi@@ got@@ ry and hel@@ ped me to realiz@@ e that a person &apos;s ra@@ ce , religi@@ on or se@@ x@@ ual ori@@ ent@@ ation had nothing to do with the qu@@ ality of one &apos;s charac@@ ter ."
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in des@@ per@@ ate need of one .
"In@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation can often come from an u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted place , and the fact that a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish com@@ e@@ di@@ an had done more to pos@@ iti@@ vely inf@@ lu@@ ence my wor@@ l@@ dvi@@ ew than my own ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ist father is not lost on me ."
"One day , I had a con@@ vers@@ ation with my mother about how my wor@@ l@@ dvi@@ ew was star@@ ting to change , and she said something to me that I will h@@ old de@@ ar to my heart for as long as I live ."
"S@@ he looked at me with the w@@ ear@@ y eyes of someone who had experi@@ en@@ ced enough do@@ g@@ mat@@ ism to last a li@@ f@@ et@@ im@@ e , and said , &quot; I &apos;m ti@@ red of h@@ ating people . &quot;"
"In that inst@@ ant , I realized how much ne@@ g@@ ative energy it takes to h@@ old that h@@ at@@ red inside of you ."
Z@@ ak E@@ bra@@ him is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end our conne@@ ction with my father and start a new life .
So why would I out myself and pot@@ enti@@ ally put myself in dan@@ ger ?
"Well , that &apos;s simple ."
"I do it in the ho@@ p@@ es that perhaps someone some@@ day who is comp@@ ell@@ ed to use viol@@ ence may hear my story and realiz@@ e that there is a better way , that al@@ though I had been sub@@ jec@@ ted to this viol@@ ent , in@@ tol@@ er@@ ant ide@@ olog@@ y , that I did not become f@@ an@@ ati@@ c@@ iz@@ ed ."
"In@@ st@@ ead , I cho@@ ose to use my experience to fi@@ ght back against ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m , against the bi@@ got@@ ry ."
"I do it for the vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s of ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m and their lov@@ ed ones , for the ter@@ ri@@ ble pa@@ in and lo@@ s@@ s that ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m has for@@ ced u@@ po@@ n their lives ."
"For the vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s of ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m , I will speak out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess ac@@ ts and con@@ de@@ m@@ n my father &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"And with that simple fact , I stand here as pro@@ of that viol@@ ence isn &apos;t in@@ her@@ ent in one &apos;s religi@@ on or ra@@ ce , and the son does not have to fol@@ low the ways of his father ."
I am not my father .
"Th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks a lot . ( Applause )"
I &apos;m del@@ igh@@ ted to be here .
"I &apos;m ho@@ no@@ red by the inv@@ it@@ ation , and th@@ an@@ ks ."
"I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interest@@ ed in , but un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , I su@@ spe@@ ct that what I &apos;m interest@@ ed in won &apos;t inter@@ est many other people ."
"F@@ i@@ rst off , my b@@ ad@@ ge says I &apos;m an astro@@ no@@ mer ."
"I would love to talk about my astro@@ no@@ my , but I su@@ spe@@ ct that the number of people who are interest@@ ed in radi@@ ative trans@@ f@@ er in no@@ n-@@ gra@@ y at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ es and pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation of light in Ju@@ pit@@ er &apos;s u@@ pp@@ er at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here are the number of people who &apos;d f@@ it in a bu@@ s sh@@ el@@ ter ."
So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
"( Laughter ) It would be just as much fu@@ n to talk about some stuff that happened in 19@@ 8@@ 6 and 19@@ 8@@ 7 , when a computer h@@ ac@@ k@@ er is bre@@ a@@ king into our systems over at L@@ aw@@ r@@ ence B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey L@@ ab@@ s ."
"And I cau@@ ght the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the S@@ ov@@ i@@ et K@@ G@@ B , and ste@@ al@@ ing information and sel@@ ling it ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be fu@@ n — but , 20 years later ..@@ ."
"I find computer se@@ cur@@ ity , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , to be kind of bor@@ ing ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science ."
"The second time , it &apos;s engine@@ ering ."
"A third time , it &apos;s just being a tech@@ ni@@ ci@@ an ."
"I &apos;m a sci@@ ent@@ ist . O@@ n@@ ce I do something , I do something else ."
"So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that ."
"N@@ or am I going to talk about what I think are obvi@@ ous stat@@ e@@ ments from my first book , &quot; &quot; S@@ il@@ ic@@ on S@@ na@@ ke O@@ il , &quot; &quot; or my second book , no@@ r am I going to talk about why I believe compu@@ ters don &apos;t bel@@ ong in scho@@ ols ."
I feel that there &apos;s a mas@@ sive and biz@@ ar@@ re idea going around that we have to bring more compu@@ ters into scho@@ ols .
My idea is : no ! No !
"G@@ et them out of scho@@ ols , and keep them out of scho@@ ols ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the argu@@ ment is so obvi@@ ous to any@@ one who &apos;s hun@@ g around a f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de clas@@ s@@ room that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I gu@@ ess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said ."
So don &apos;t go back and read my dis@@ ser@@ t@@ ation .
It probably has li@@ es in it as well .
"H@@ av@@ ing said that , I out@@ lin@@ ed my talk about five minutes ago ."
"( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the ma@@ in thing I w@@ ro@@ te on my th@@ um@@ b was the future ."
"I &apos;m sup@@ posed to talk about the future , yes ?"
"O@@ h , right . And my feel@@ ing is , as@@ king me to talk about the future is biz@@ ar@@ re , because I &apos;ve got gra@@ y ha@@ ir , and so , it &apos;s kind of sil@@ ly for me to talk about the future ."
"In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technolo@@ g@@ ist , a sci@@ ent@@ ist , a physi@@ c@@ ist ."
No ! D@@ on &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writ@@ ing c@@ ode .
"No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teach@@ er ."
They know .
"In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teach@@ er , ask an experi@@ en@@ ced one ."
They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another gener@@ ation .
"I don &apos;t . N@@ or , I su@@ spe@@ ct , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring ."
"C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly , all of us can imagine these co@@ ol new things that are going to be there ."
"But to me , things are@@ n &apos;t the future ."
"What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ ally good at text mes@@ sa@@ ging and spend a huge amount of on@@ -@@ scre@@ en time , but have never gone bo@@ w@@ ling together ?"
"Ch@@ an@@ ge is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in so@@ f@@ tw@@ are ."
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
"I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fu@@ n , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?"
Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . R@@ ight over here .
I@@ s that vi@@ sible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is on@@ e-@@ si@@ ded things .
I would de@@ arly love to talk about things that have one side .
"Because I love M@@ ob@@ i@@ us lo@@ op@@ s . I not only love M@@ ob@@ i@@ us lo@@ op@@ s , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les ."
"R@@ ight away , I hope that all of your eyes gla@@ ze over ."
This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle .
"For those of you in the audi@@ ence who know , you ro@@ ll your eyes and say , y@@ up , I know all about it ."
It &apos;s one si@@ ded . It &apos;s a bot@@ tle wh@@ ose inside is its outside .
It has zer@@ o vol@@ u@@ me . And it &apos;s no@@ n-@@ ori@@ en@@ table .
It has wonderful pro@@ per@@ ti@@ es .
"If you take two M@@ ob@@ i@@ us lo@@ op@@ s and se@@ w their common ed@@ ge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glas@@ s ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : I &apos;ve got a c@@ old . ) H@@ ow@@ ever , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stan@@ ds for design ."
"@@ Ju@@ st two we@@ eks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medi@@ um and big K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les for the tra@@ de ."
"But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m del@@ igh@@ ted to show you , first time in public here ."
"This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle w@@ ine bot@@ tle , which , al@@ though in four d@@ imen@@ sions it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be able to h@@ old any f@@ lu@@ id at all , it &apos;s perf@@ ec@@ tly cap@@ able of doing so because our universe has only three sp@@ ati@@ al d@@ imen@@ sions ."
"And because our universe is only three sp@@ ati@@ al d@@ imen@@ sions , it can h@@ old f@@ lu@@ i@@ ds ."
So it &apos;s high@@ ly — that one &apos;s the co@@ ol one .
That was a mon@@ th of my life .
"But al@@ though I would love to talk about to@@ polo@@ gy with you , I &apos;m not going to ."
"( Laughter ) In@@ st@@ ead , I &apos;m going to men@@ tion my mom , who pas@@ sed away last sum@@ mer ."

"And I looked over her al@@ bu@@ m and she had colle@@ cted a picture of me , standing — well , sit@@ ting — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 , in front of a bu@@ n@@ ch of di@@ als ."

"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve ta@@ u@@ ght gradu@@ ate — I &apos;ve had gradu@@ ate students , I &apos;ve ta@@ u@@ ght under@@ gradu@@ ate clas@@ ses . &quot; &quot; No , they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you a@@ in &apos;t over here on the front lin@@ es ?"
P@@ ut your money where you m@@ outh is . &quot; &quot; I@@ s true . I@@ s true . I te@@ ach ei@@ gh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ de science four days a week .
N@@ ot just sho@@ wing up every now and then .
"No , no , no , no , no . I take atten@@ dan@@ ce ."
"I take l@@ un@@ ch h@@ our . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not c@@ la@@ ps ."
I stron@@ g@@ ly su@@ gg@@ est that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
N@@ ot just show up to clas@@ s every now and then .
"T@@ each a sol@@ id week . O@@ kay , I &apos;m teach@@ ing thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters time , but good enough ."
"One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , I &apos;m going to te@@ ach you colle@@ ge@@ -@@ level physi@@ cs ."
"No cal@@ cul@@ us , I &apos;ll c@@ ut out that ."
You won &apos;t need to know tri@@ g .
"But you will need to know ei@@ gh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ de al@@ ge@@ b@@ ra , and we &apos;re going to do seri@@ ous experim@@ ents ."
N@@ one of this op@@ en@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ cha@@ p@@ ter@@ -@@ se@@ ven@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ do@@ -@@ all@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ od@@ d-@@ proble@@ m@@ -@@ s@@ ets .
We &apos;re going to be doing gen@@ u@@ ine physi@@ cs . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
"( H@@ igh@@ -@@ pit@@ ched t@@ one ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three we@@ eks ago in my clas@@ s — this is through the len@@ s , and one of the things we used a len@@ s for was to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light ."
"My students in E@@ l C@@ er@@ ri@@ to — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very be@@ at up os@@ c@@ il@@ lo@@ sc@@ op@@ e — meas@@ u@@ red the spe@@ ed of light ."
We were off by 25 percent . How many ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ ders do you know of who have meas@@ u@@ red the spe@@ ed of light ?
"In add@@ ition to that , we &apos;ve meas@@ u@@ red the spe@@ ed of sound ."
I &apos;d love to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light here .
"I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; A@@ w man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to im@@ pose u@@ po@@ n the po@@ wers that be , and meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light ."
"And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !"
And there &apos;s no time to do it .
"So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light !"
"But me@@ an@@ while , let &apos;s meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of sound !"
"Well , the obvi@@ ous way to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of sound is to b@@ oun@@ ce sound off something and look at the ech@@ o ."
"But , probably — one of my students , A@@ ri@@ el &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , said , &quot; C@@ ould we meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light using the w@@ ave equ@@ ation ? &quot;"
And all of you know the w@@ ave equ@@ ation is the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy times the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of any w@@ ave ...
"@@ is a con@@ st@@ ant . Wh@@ en the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy goes up , the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th comes down . W@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th goes up , fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy goes down . So , if we have a w@@ ave here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the pit@@ ch goes up , things get clo@@ s@@ er , pit@@ ch goes down , things stre@@ t@@ ch out ."
R@@ ight ? This is simple physi@@ cs .
"A@@ ll of you know this from ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de , remember ?"
"What they didn &apos;t tell you in physi@@ cs — in ei@@ gh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ de physi@@ cs — but they should have , and I w@@ ish they had , was that if you mul@@ ti@@ ply the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy times the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of sound or light , you get a con@@ st@@ ant ."
And that con@@ st@@ ant is the spe@@ ed of sound .
"So , in order to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy . Well , that &apos;s easy ."
I &apos;ve got a fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy coun@@ ter right here .
"S@@ et it up to around A , ab@@ ov@@ e A , ab@@ ov@@ e A@@ . There &apos;s an A , more or less ."
"Now , so I know the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy ."
It &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 kil@@ o@@ her@@ t@@ z . I meas@@ ure its w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th .
"A@@ ll I need now is to f@@ li@@ p on another be@@ am , and the bot@@ tom be@@ am is me talking , right ?"
"So any@@ time I talk , you &apos;d see it on the scre@@ en ."
"I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the sour@@ ce , you &apos;ll not@@ ice the spi@@ ral ."
"The sl@@ in@@ k@@ y mo@@ ves . We &apos;re going through different no@@ des of the w@@ ave , coming out this way ."
"Th@@ ose of you who are physi@@ ci@@ sts , I hear you ro@@ l@@ ling your eyes , but be@@ ar with me . ( Laughter ) T@@ o meas@@ ure the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th , all I need to do is meas@@ ure the di@@ stance from here — one full w@@ ave — over to here ."
F@@ rom here to here is the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of sound .
"So , I &apos;ll put a meas@@ uring ta@@ pe here , meas@@ uring ta@@ pe here , move it back over to here ."
I &apos;ve mo@@ ved the micro@@ phone 20 cent@@ im@@ et@@ ers .
"@@ 0@@ .@@ 2 met@@ ers from here , back to here , 20 cent@@ im@@ et@@ ers ."
"O@@ K , let &apos;s go back to M@@ r@@ . E@@ l@@ mo ."
"And we &apos;ll say the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy is 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 kil@@ o@@ her@@ t@@ z , or 1@@ 7@@ 60 ."
The w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th was 0@@ .@@ 2 met@@ ers .
Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 times 0@@ .@@ 2 over here is 3@@ 5@@ 2 met@@ ers per second .
"If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 3@@ 4@@ 3 ."
"But , here with kl@@ ud@@ gy material , and l@@ ou@@ sy d@@ rin@@ k — we &apos;ve been able to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of sound to — not bad . P@@ ret@@ ty good ."
All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
G@@ o back to this picture of me a million years ago .
"It was 19@@ 7@@ 1 , the V@@ i@@ et@@ nam W@@ ar was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my G@@ od ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m stud@@ ying physi@@ cs : L@@ an@@ da@@ u , Li@@ p@@ sch@@ it@@ z , R@@ es@@ ni@@ ck and H@@ al@@ li@@ day ."
I &apos;m going home for a mid@@ ter@@ m . A ri@@ ot &apos;s going on on cam@@ p@@ us .
"There &apos;s a ri@@ ot ! H@@ ey , E@@ l@@ mo &apos;s done : off ."
"There &apos;s a ri@@ ot going on on cam@@ p@@ us , and the poli@@ ce are chas@@ ing me , right ?"
"I &apos;m wal@@ king across cam@@ p@@ us . C@@ op comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a stud@@ ent . &quot;"
P@@ ul@@ ls out a gu@@ n . Go@@ es bo@@ om !
And a te@@ ar g@@ as c@@ ani@@ ster the size of a P@@ ep@@ s@@ i can goes by my head . W@@ ho@@ os@@ h !
I get a bre@@ ath of te@@ ar g@@ as and I can &apos;t bre@@ a@@ the .
This co@@ p comes after me with a ri@@ f@@ le .
He wan@@ ts to cl@@ un@@ k me over the head !
"I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to clear out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go ru@@ n@@ ning across cam@@ p@@ us qu@@ ick as I can . I duc@@ k into H@@ a@@ yes H@@ all ."
It &apos;s one of these bel@@ l@@ -@@ to@@ wer buil@@ din@@ gs .
The co@@ p &apos;s chas@@ ing me .
"Ch@@ as@@ ing me up the first flo@@ or , second flo@@ or , third flo@@ or ."
Ch@@ ases me into this room .
The ent@@ ran@@ c@@ e@@ way to the b@@ ell to@@ wer .
"I s@@ la@@ m the do@@ or behind me , clim@@ b up , go past this place where I see a pen@@ du@@ lu@@ m ti@@ c@@ king ."
"And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , the squ@@ are ro@@ ot of the len@@ g@@ th is pro@@ por@@ ti@@ onal to its period . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep clim@@ b@@ ing up , go back ."
I go to a place where a do@@ w@@ el s@@ pl@@ its off .
"There &apos;s a clo@@ ck , clo@@ ck , clo@@ ck , clo@@ ck ."
The time &apos;s going back@@ wards because I &apos;m inside of it .
I &apos;m thinking of L@@ or@@ en@@ z con@@ tra@@ ctions and E@@ inst@@ e@@ in@@ i@@ an rel@@ ativ@@ ity .
"I clim@@ b up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you clim@@ b up this wo@@ od@@ en lad@@ der ."
"I po@@ p up the top , and there &apos;s a cu@@ pol@@ a ."
"A d@@ ome , one of these ten@@ -@@ fo@@ ot dom@@ es ."
"I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the c@@ op@@ s ba@@ sh@@ ing students &apos; he@@ ads , sho@@ ot@@ ing te@@ ar g@@ as , and wat@@ ching students th@@ ro@@ wing bri@@ cks ."
"And I &apos;m as@@ king , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I remember what my En@@ gli@@ sh teach@@ er in high school said ."
"N@@ am@@ ely , that when they c@@ ast bel@@ ls , they write in@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tions on them ."
"So , I wi@@ pe the p@@ ig@@ e@@ on man@@ ure off one of the bel@@ ls , and I look at it ."
"I &apos;m as@@ king myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words in@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed u@@ po@@ n the H@@ a@@ yes H@@ all to@@ wer bel@@ ls : &quot; &quot; All tru@@ th is one ."

"It is the vo@@ ice of life , which call@@ s us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much ."
It &apos;s for the number needed to tre@@ at .
Go@@ od mor@@ ning !
A@@ re you a@@ wa@@ ke ?
"They took my name ta@@ g , but I wanted to ask you , did any@@ one here write their name on the ta@@ g in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ?"
"A@@ ny@@ one ! No one ? All right , no problem ."
"O@@ n@@ ce u@@ po@@ n a time , not long ago , I was sit@@ ting in a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant with my friend , or@@ der@@ ing food ."
"So I looked at the wa@@ it@@ er and said , &quot; Do you have a men@@ u ( A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ) ? &quot;"
"He looked at me stran@@ g@@ ely , thinking that he mi@@ sh@@ ear@@ d ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; S@@ or@@ ry ? ( En@@ gli@@ sh ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The men@@ u ( A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ) , ple@@ ase . &quot; &quot; He re@@ pli@@ ed , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; ( En@@ gli@@ sh ) , or &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; ( F@@ ren@@ ch ) . &quot; &quot; I@@ s the F@@ ren@@ ch pro@@ n@@ un@@ ci@@ ation cor@@ rec@@ t ?"
"&quot; &quot; C@@ ome , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the wa@@ it@@ er ."
"He was dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ed when talking to me , as if he was saying to him@@ self , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;"
What &apos;s the me@@ an@@ ing of saying &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ?
T@@ w@@ o words made a Le@@ ban@@ ese young man ju@@ d@@ ge a girl as being back@@ ward and ig@@ no@@ ran@@ t .
How could she speak that way ?
"A@@ t that moment , I started thinking ."
It made me ma@@ d .
It de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely h@@ ur@@ ts !
I &apos;m d@@ eni@@ ed the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
Wh@@ ere could this happen ?
How did we get here ?
"Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would re@@ ach a stage in their lives , where they invol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re mo@@ der@@ n and ci@@ viliz@@ ed ."
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get all my culture , thou@@ ghts , intel@@ le@@ ct and all my mem@@ ories ?"
Ch@@ il@@ d@@ ho@@ od stories might be the best mem@@ ories we have of the war !
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get everything I learned in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c , just to con@@ form ?"
T@@ o be one of them ?
Wh@@ ere &apos;s the lo@@ gic in that ?
"D@@ es@@ p@@ ite all that , I tri@@ ed to understand him ."
I didn &apos;t want to ju@@ d@@ ge him with the same c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty that he ju@@ d@@ g@@ ed me .
The A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language doesn &apos;t s@@ at@@ is@@ fy today &apos;s needs .
"It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in univers@@ ities , a language we use in the work@@ place , a language we rely on if we were to per@@ form an adv@@ an@@ ced research project , and it de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely isn &apos;t a language we use at the air@@ port ."
"If we did so , they &apos;d stri@@ p us of our clo@@ th@@ es ."
"Wh@@ ere can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !"
"So , you want us to use A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c . Wh@@ ere are we to do so ?"
This is one reality .
But we have another more important reality that we ou@@ ght to think about .
A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c is the mother ton@@ gu@@ e .
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch says that ma@@ st@@ ery of other langu@@ ages de@@ man@@ ds ma@@ st@@ ery of the mother ton@@ gu@@ e .
M@@ ast@@ ery of the mother ton@@ gu@@ e is a pr@@ ere@@ qu@@ is@@ ite for cre@@ ative ex@@ pres@@ sion in other langu@@ ages .
How ?
"G@@ i@@ bra@@ n K@@ hal@@ il G@@ i@@ bra@@ n , when he first started writ@@ ing , he used A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ."
"A@@ ll his ideas , imag@@ in@@ ation and ph@@ il@@ oso@@ ph@@ y were in@@ spi@@ red by this little bo@@ y in the v@@ ill@@ age where he gre@@ w up , sm@@ ell@@ ing a speci@@ fic sm@@ ell , hear@@ ing a speci@@ fic vo@@ ice , and thinking a speci@@ fic thought ."
"So , when he started writ@@ ing in En@@ gli@@ sh , he had enough b@@ ag@@ g@@ age ."
"E@@ ven when he w@@ ro@@ te in En@@ gli@@ sh , when you read his writ@@ ings in En@@ gli@@ sh , you sm@@ ell the same sm@@ ell , sense the same feel@@ ing ."
"You can imagine that that &apos;s him writ@@ ing in En@@ gli@@ sh , the same bo@@ y who came from the m@@ oun@@ tain . F@@ rom a v@@ ill@@ age on M@@ oun@@ t Le@@ ban@@ on ."
"So , this is an example no one can argu@@ e with ."
"Se@@ con@@ d , it &apos;s often said that if you want to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , the only way to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , is to k@@ ill its language ."
This is a reality that develop@@ ed soci@@ et@@ ies are aw@@ are of .
"The Ger@@ m@@ ans , F@@ ren@@ ch , J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese and Ch@@ in@@ ese , all these n@@ ations are aw@@ are of this ."
That &apos;s why they leg@@ isl@@ ate to prote@@ ct their language .
They make it s@@ ac@@ red .
"That &apos;s why they use it in produc@@ tion , they p@@ ay a lot of money to devel@@ op it ."
Do we know better than them ?
"A@@ ll right , we are@@ n &apos;t from the develop@@ ed world , this adv@@ an@@ ced thinking h@@ asn &apos;t re@@ ach@@ ed us yet , and we would like to cat@@ ch up with the ci@@ viliz@@ ed world ."
"C@@ oun@@ tries that were once like us , but decided to stri@@ ve for develop@@ ment , do research , and cat@@ ch up with those countries , such as T@@ ur@@ key , M@@ al@@ a@@ ysi@@ a and others , they car@@ ri@@ ed their language with them as they were clim@@ b@@ ing the lad@@ der , prote@@ cted it like a di@@ am@@ ond ."
They k@@ ept it close to them .
"Because if you get any produc@@ t from T@@ ur@@ key or el@@ se@@ where and it &apos;s not lab@@ el@@ ed in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , then it isn &apos;t a local produc@@ t ."
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local produc@@ t .
"They &apos;d go back to being con@@ su@@ mer@@ s , clu@@ el@@ ess con@@ su@@ mer@@ s , like we are most of the time ."
"So , in order for them to innov@@ ate and produ@@ ce , they had to prote@@ ct their language ."
"If I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , sov@@ ere@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , inde@@ pen@@ d@@ ence ( A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ) , &quot; &quot; what does this rem@@ ind you of ?"
"It doesn &apos;t r@@ ing a b@@ ell , does it ?"
"R@@ eg@@ ar@@ dl@@ ess of the who , how and why ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t just for con@@ ver@@ sing , just words coming out of our m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"So when we say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , sov@@ ere@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , inde@@ pen@@ d@@ ence , &quot; &quot; each one of you dra@@ ws a speci@@ fic image in their own mind , there are speci@@ fic feel@@ ings of a speci@@ fic day in a speci@@ fic hist@@ or@@ ical period ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t one , two or three words or let@@ ters put together ."
"It &apos;s an idea inside that rel@@ ates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us ."
What is our intel@@ le@@ ct ?
How do you say whether this guy under@@ stan@@ ds or not ?
"So , if I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , sov@@ ere@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , inde@@ pen@@ d@@ ence ( En@@ gli@@ sh ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; D@@ ad , have you li@@ ved through the period of the fre@@ e@@ dom ( En@@ gli@@ sh ) slo@@ g@@ an ? &quot;"
How would you feel ?
"If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in va@@ in ."
The idea is that these ex@@ pres@@ sions rem@@ ind us of a speci@@ fic thing .
I have a f@@ ran@@ c@@ op@@ h@@ one friend who &apos;s mar@@ ri@@ ed to a F@@ ren@@ ch man .
I asked her once how things were going .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing is f@@ ine , but once , I sp@@ ent a whole night as@@ king and trying to tran@@ sl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of the word &apos; to@@ q@@ bor@@ ni &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The po@@ or woman had mi@@ st@@ ak@@ en@@ ly told him &quot; &quot; to@@ q@@ bor@@ ni , &quot; &quot; and then sp@@ ent the whole night trying to expla@@ in it to him ."
He was pu@@ z@@ z@@ led by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could any@@ one be this c@@ ru@@ el ?
D@@ o@@ es she want to comm@@ it su@@ ici@@ de ?
&apos;@@ B@@ ury me ? &apos; ( En@@ gli@@ sh ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few exam@@ ples .
"It made us feel that she &apos;s u@@ na@@ ble to tell that word to her h@@ us@@ b@@ and , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different ."
"S@@ he said to me , &quot; &quot; He list@@ ens to F@@ a@@ iru@@ z with me , and one night , I tri@@ ed to tran@@ sl@@ ate for him so he can feel what I feel when I list@@ en to F@@ a@@ iru@@ z . &quot; &quot; The po@@ or woman tri@@ ed to tran@@ sl@@ ate this for him : &quot; F@@ rom them I ex@@ ten@@ ded my hands and st@@ ole you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pic@@ k@@ le : &quot; And because you bel@@ ong to them , I re@@ turned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )"
T@@ ran@@ sl@@ ate that for me .
"( Applause ) So , what have we done to prote@@ ct the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language ?"
"We turned this into a con@@ cer@@ n of the ci@@ vil society , and we lau@@ n@@ ched a cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to pre@@ ser@@ ve the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language ."
"E@@ ven though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bo@@ ther ?"
F@@ or@@ get about this he@@ a@@ dach@@ e and go have fu@@ n . &quot; &quot; No problem !
"The cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to pre@@ ser@@ ve A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c lau@@ n@@ ched a slo@@ g@@ an that says , &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ ply from the W@@ est . &quot;"
"We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not acc@@ ept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t a@@ do@@ pt this st@@ y@@ le because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be under@@ sto@@ od ."
"And when someone tal@@ ks to me that way , I h@@ ate the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language ."
"We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be con@@ vin@@ ced in a way that re@@ fle@@ c@@ ts our dre@@ am@@ s , as@@ pi@@ r@@ ations and da@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ day life ."
In a way that d@@ res@@ ses like us and thin@@ ks like we do .
"So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ ply from the W@@ est &quot; &quot; has h@@ it the spo@@ t ."
"S@@ om@@ e@@ thing very easy , yet cre@@ ative and per@@ su@@ a@@ sive ."
"A@@ f@@ ter that , we lau@@ n@@ ched another cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n with sc@@ en@@ es of let@@ ters on the ground ."
"You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a sc@@ en@@ e of a let@@ ter sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by black and y@@ el@@ low ta@@ pe with &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t k@@ ill your language ! &quot; &quot; writ@@ ten on it ."
"Wh@@ y ? S@@ eri@@ ously , don &apos;t k@@ ill your language ."
We really sh@@ ouldn &apos;t k@@ ill our language .
"If we were to k@@ ill the language , we &apos;d have to find an id@@ ent@@ ity ."
We &apos;d have to find an exist@@ ence .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
This is be@@ y@@ ond just mis@@ sing our chan@@ ce of being mo@@ der@@ n and ci@@ viliz@@ ed .
A@@ f@@ ter that we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed ph@@ ot@@ os of guys and gir@@ ls w@@ ear@@ ing the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c let@@ ter .
P@@ hot@@ os of &quot; &quot; co@@ ol &quot; &quot; guys and gir@@ ls .
We are very co@@ ol !
"And to wh@@ o@@ ever might say , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ! You used an En@@ gli@@ sh word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I a@@ do@@ pt the word &apos; co@@ ol . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them ob@@ ject ho@@ w@@ ever they want , but give me a word that &apos;s ni@@ cer and mat@@ ch@@ es the reality better ."
I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wi@@ de we@@ b &quot; &quot; ( L@@ augh@@ s ) Because it doesn &apos;t f@@ it ! We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t ki@@ d ourselves .
"But to re@@ ach this point , we all have to be con@@ vin@@ ced that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t al@@ low any@@ one who is bi@@ g@@ ger or thin@@ ks they have any au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want ."
C@@ re@@ ativ@@ ity is the idea .
"So , if we can &apos;t re@@ ach space or build a ro@@ ck@@ et and so on , we can be cre@@ ative ."
"A@@ t this moment , every one of you is a cre@@ ative project ."
C@@ re@@ ativ@@ ity in your mother ton@@ gu@@ e is the pat@@ h .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
Let &apos;s write a nov@@ el or produ@@ ce a shor@@ t fil@@ m .
A single nov@@ el could make us global again .
It could bring the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language back to being number one .
"So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !"
"But we have to know that , and be con@@ vin@@ ced that a solution exist@@ s , that we have a du@@ ty to be part of that solution ."
"In con@@ clu@@ sion , what can you do today ?"
"Now , t@@ we@@ ets , who &apos;s t@@ we@@ et@@ ing ?"
"P@@ le@@ ase , I be@@ g of you , even though my time has fin@@ ish@@ ed , ei@@ ther A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c , En@@ gli@@ sh , F@@ ren@@ ch or Ch@@ in@@ ese ."
But don &apos;t write A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c with L@@ at@@ in charac@@ ters mi@@ x@@ ed with num@@ bers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a dis@@ aster ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be en@@ ter@@ ing a vir@@ tual world with a vir@@ tual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and ri@@ se .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
"Se@@ con@@ d , there are many other things that we can do ."
We &apos;re not here today to con@@ vin@@ ce each other .
We &apos;re here to bring atten@@ tion to the ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ity of pre@@ ser@@ ving this language .
Now I will tell you a se@@ cre@@ t .
A bab@@ y first id@@ enti@@ fi@@ es its father through language .
"When my d@@ aughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , h@@ on@@ ey ( A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your da@@ d , h@@ on@@ ey ( En@@ gli@@ sh ) . &quot; &quot; And in the super@@ market , I pro@@ mi@@ se my d@@ aughter N@@ o@@ or , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ ks ( A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; D@@ is , &apos; M@@ er@@ c@@ i , M@@ am@@ an , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her ."
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get ri@@ d of this cul@@ tu@@ ral c@@ rin@@ ge . ( Applause )
"S@@ u@@ sta@@ in@@ ability re@@ pres@@ ents the what , the where and the how of what is cau@@ ght ."
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my din@@ ner cho@@ ices .
I want to know how I imp@@ act them .
I want to know how they imp@@ act me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s b@@ oun@@ ty for their living .
U@@ n@@ der@@ standing all of this en@@ ab@@ les us to shi@@ ft our perc@@ ep@@ tion of se@@ a@@ food away from a com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity to an opport@@ unity to re@@ st@@ ore our ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em .
It allo@@ ws for us to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the se@@ a@@ food that we &apos;re also so for@@ tun@@ ate to e@@ at .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ a@@ food .
"Wh@@ ere su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability is the cap@@ ac@@ ity to en@@ d@@ ure and ma@@ in@@ tain , re@@ stor@@ ative is the ability to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish and progres@@ s ."
"R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ a@@ food allo@@ ws for an evol@@ ving and dy@@ na@@ mic system and ac@@ knowled@@ ges our relation@@ ship with the ocean as a resour@@ ce , su@@ gg@@ est@@ ing that we eng@@ age to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the ocean and to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge its res@@ ili@@ en@@ cy ."
"It is a more ho@@ pe@@ ful , it is a more human , and is a more u@@ se@@ ful way of under@@ standing our environment ."
W@@ al@@ let gu@@ id@@ es — stan@@ d@@ ard issue by lots in the mar@@ ine con@@ ser@@ v@@ ation world — are very han@@ dy ; they &apos;re a wonderful to@@ ol .
"G@@ re@@ en , y@@ el@@ low and red li@@ sts &#91; of &#93; se@@ a@@ food species ."
"The as@@ soci@@ ation is very easy : bu@@ y gre@@ en , don &apos;t bu@@ y red , think tw@@ ice about y@@ el@@ low ."
"But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just e@@ at gre@@ en li@@ st ."
We can &apos;t su@@ sta@@ in this without the meas@@ ure of our succ@@ ess really chang@@ ing the f@@ ate of the species in the y@@ el@@ low and the red .
But what if we e@@ at only in the gre@@ en li@@ st ?
You &apos;ve got pole@@ -@@ cau@@ ght y@@ el@@ lo@@ w@@ f@@ in tu@@ na here — comes from su@@ sta@@ in@@ able sto@@ cks .
P@@ ole cau@@ ght — no by@@ cat@@ ch .
Gre@@ at for fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men . L@@ ots of money . S@@ up@@ por@@ ting local econo@@ mi@@ es .
But it &apos;s a lion of the se@@ a . It &apos;s a top pred@@ ator .
What &apos;s the con@@ text of this me@@ al ?
A@@ m I sit@@ ting down in a ste@@ ak@@ house to a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of this ?
Do I do this three times a week ?
"I might still be in the gre@@ en li@@ st , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oc@@ e@@ ans any fav@@ ors ."
"The point is that we have to have a con@@ text , a g@@ au@@ ge for our ac@@ tions in all this ."
E@@ x@@ am@@ ple : I &apos;ve heard that red w@@ ine is great for my health — anti@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ dan@@ ts and min@@ er@@ als — heart heal@@ thy .
That &apos;s great ! I love red w@@ ine !
I &apos;m going to d@@ rin@@ k so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so heal@@ thy .
"Well , how many bot@@ t@@ les is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?"
"Well fol@@ ks , we have a prote@@ in problem ."
"We have lost this sen@@ sibil@@ ity when it reg@@ ar@@ ds our food , and we are pa@@ ying a cost ."
The problem is we are hi@@ ding that cost ben@@ e@@ ath the w@@ av@@ es .
We are hi@@ ding that cost behind the social acc@@ ep@@ t@@ ance of ex@@ pan@@ ding wa@@ ist@@ lin@@ es .
And we are hi@@ ding that cost behind mon@@ ster prof@@ its .
So the first thing about this idea of re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ a@@ food is that it really takes into ac@@ coun@@ t our needs .
"R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ a@@ food might best be re@@ pres@@ ented not by J@@ a@@ ws , or by F@@ li@@ pp@@ er , or the G@@ or@@ don &apos;s fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man , but rather , by the J@@ ol@@ ly Gre@@ en G@@ i@@ ant ."
V@@ e@@ get@@ ab@@ les : they might yet s@@ ave the oc@@ e@@ ans .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a lik@@ es to say that bl@@ ue is the new gre@@ en .
Well I &apos;d like to re@@ spe@@ c@@ t@@ fully sub@@ m@@ it that bro@@ c@@ col@@ i gre@@ en might then be the new bl@@ ue .
"We must contin@@ ue to e@@ at the best se@@ a@@ food possible , if at all ."
But we also must e@@ at it with a ton of ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les .
The best part about re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ a@@ food though is that it comes on the hal@@ f-@@ sh@@ ell with a bot@@ tle of T@@ ab@@ as@@ c@@ o and le@@ mon w@@ ed@@ ges .
"It comes in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of t@@ il@@ ap@@ ia b@@ read@@ ed with D@@ i@@ j@@ on mu@@ star@@ d and cri@@ sp@@ y , bro@@ il@@ ed b@@ read@@ c@@ ru@@ m@@ b@@ s and a ste@@ am@@ ing p@@ ile of pe@@ can qu@@ in@@ o@@ a p@@ il@@ a@@ f with c@@ ru@@ n@@ ch@@ y , gr@@ ill@@ ed bro@@ c@@ col@@ i so so@@ ft and s@@ we@@ et and ch@@ ar@@ red and s@@ mo@@ k@@ y on the outside with just a h@@ in@@ t of ch@@ ili f@@ la@@ ke ."
W@@ ho@@ o@@ o !
This is an easy s@@ ell .
And the best part is all of those in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents are av@@ ail@@ able to every family at the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od W@@ al@@ mar@@ t .
J@@ am@@ ie O@@ li@@ ver is cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ning to s@@ ave America from the way we e@@ at .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a is cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ning to s@@ ave the oc@@ e@@ ans from the way we e@@ at .
There &apos;s a patter@@ n here .
F@@ or@@ get nu@@ clear h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st ; it &apos;s the for@@ k that we have to wor@@ ry about .
We have ra@@ va@@ g@@ ed our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sour@@ ced to han@@ di@@ ca@@ p ourselves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole e@@ ating thing wrong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expe@@ ct from our food .
Su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability is comp@@ lic@@ ated but din@@ ner is a reality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of movement rec@@ ently in gre@@ ening our food systems .
D@@ an B@@ ar@@ ber and A@@ li@@ ce W@@ at@@ ers are le@@ ad@@ ing pas@@ sion@@ ately the gre@@ en food D@@ el@@ ici@@ ous R@@ evol@@ ution .
But gre@@ en fo@@ od@@ s often re@@ present a way for us to dis@@ reg@@ ard the respon@@ sibil@@ ity as e@@ at@@ ers .
Ju@@ st because it comes from a gre@@ en sour@@ ce doesn &apos;t mean we can tre@@ at it with dis@@ reg@@ ard on the pl@@ ate .
We have ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ en@@ dly sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ en@@ dly all@@ -@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ e@@ at sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p bu@@ ff@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t work .
H@@ ear@@ t-@@ heal@@ thy din@@ ner is a very important part of re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ a@@ food .
"Wh@@ ile we try to man@@ age de@@ cl@@ ining mar@@ ine popul@@ ations , the medi@@ a &apos;s re@@ com@@ men@@ ding incre@@ as@@ ed con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion of se@@ a@@ food ."
"S@@ tu@@ di@@ es say that ten@@ s of thousands of American gran@@ d@@ mo@@ thers , gran@@ d@@ fa@@ thers , mo@@ thers and fa@@ thers might be around for another bir@@ th@@ day if we inclu@@ ded more se@@ a@@ food ."
That &apos;s a re@@ ward I am not w@@ ill@@ ing to pas@@ s up .
But it &apos;s not all about the se@@ a@@ food .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our plat@@ es .
"As a che@@ f , I realiz@@ e the e@@ a@@ si@@ est thing for me to do is re@@ du@@ ce the por@@ tion si@@ z@@ es on my pl@@ ate ."
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
"P@@ eople started bu@@ ying app@@ et@@ iz@@ ers and s@@ al@@ ads , because they knew they wer@@ en &apos;t going to f@@ ill up on the ent@@ re@@ es alone ."
"P@@ eople sp@@ ent more time eng@@ ag@@ ing in their me@@ als , eng@@ ag@@ ing with each other over their me@@ als ."
"P@@ eople got , in shor@@ t , more of what they came there for even though they got less prote@@ in ."
They got more cal@@ ories over the course of a di@@ ver@@ si@@ fi@@ ed me@@ al .
They got heal@@ th@@ i@@ er . I made more money .
This is great .
"E@@ n@@ vi@@ ron@@ mental consi@@ der@@ ation was ser@@ ved with every pl@@ ate , but it was ser@@ ved with a he@@ ap@@ ing m@@ ound of consi@@ der@@ ation for human interest@@ s at the same time ."
"One of the other things we did was beg@@ in to di@@ ver@@ si@@ fy the species that we ser@@ ved — small sil@@ ver@@ fish , an@@ ch@@ ov@@ ies , m@@ ac@@ k@@ er@@ el , s@@ ar@@ din@@ es were un@@ common ."
"S@@ h@@ ell@@ fish , m@@ us@@ sel@@ s , o@@ y@@ st@@ ers , cl@@ am@@ s , t@@ il@@ ap@@ ia , ch@@ ar — these were the common species ."
"We were direc@@ ting ta@@ st@@ es to@@ wards more res@@ ili@@ ence , more re@@ stor@@ ative op@@ tions ."
This is what we need to fav@@ or .
This is what the gre@@ en li@@ st says .
But this is also how we can actually beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore our environment .
"But what of those big pred@@ at@@ ors , those fa@@ shi@@ on@@ able species , that gre@@ en li@@ st tu@@ na that I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er ?"
"Well , if you must , I have a re@@ ci@@ pe for you ."
"It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go ."
S@@ t@@ art with a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of big fish .
G@@ et a kni@@ fe . C@@ ut it into four por@@ tions .
P@@ ut it on four plat@@ es .
"M@@ ound up those four plat@@ es with ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les and then open up the very best bot@@ tle of B@@ ur@@ g@@ un@@ dy you have , light the can@@ dl@@ es and c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate it ."
C@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the opport@@ unity you have to e@@ at this .
"In@@ v@@ ite your friends and ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s over and re@@ pe@@ at once a year , maybe ."
I expe@@ ct a lot from food .
I expe@@ ct health and jo@@ y and family and community .
"I expe@@ ct that produc@@ ing in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents , pre@@ par@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es and e@@ ating me@@ als is all part of the com@@ muni@@ on of human interest@@ s ."
I was lu@@ ck@@ y enough that my father was a fanta@@ st@@ ic co@@ ok .
And he ta@@ u@@ ght me very early on about the priv@@ il@@ e@@ ge that e@@ ating re@@ pres@@ ents .
I remember well the me@@ als of my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od .
"They were reas@@ on@@ able por@@ tions of prote@@ in ser@@ ved with c@@ op@@ i@@ ous qu@@ an@@ t@@ ities of ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les and small amoun@@ ts of star@@ ch , u@@ su@@ ally ri@@ ce ."
This is still how I lar@@ g@@ ely e@@ at today .
I get si@@ ck when I go to ste@@ ak@@ hou@@ ses .
I get the me@@ at s@@ we@@ ats .
It &apos;s like a han@@ gov@@ er from prote@@ in .
It &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing .
"But of all the di@@ re news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oc@@ e@@ ans , I have the un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate bur@@ den of deli@@ ver@@ ing to you pos@@ si@@ bly the very wor@@ st of it and that is this whole time your mother was right ."
E@@ at your ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les .
It &apos;s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward .
So what are we looking for in a me@@ al ?
"Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that are good for my body ."
"For jo@@ y , I &apos;m looking for bu@@ t@@ ter and s@@ al@@ t and se@@ x@@ y things that make things ta@@ st@@ e less like pen@@ ance ."
"For family , I &apos;m looking for re@@ ci@@ p@@ es that gen@@ u@@ fle@@ ct to my own pers@@ onal h@@ istori@@ es ."
"For community though , we start at the very beginning ."
There &apos;s no es@@ cap@@ ing the fact that everything we e@@ at has a global imp@@ act .
So try and learn as best you can what that imp@@ act is and then take the first step to min@@ im@@ ize it .
"We &apos;ve seen an image of our bl@@ ue planet , our world b@@ ank ."
But it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our resour@@ ces ; it &apos;s also the global ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y of the com@@ muni@@ on we call din@@ ner .
"So if we all take only what we need , then we can beg@@ in to share the re@@ st , we can beg@@ in to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate , we can beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore ."
We need to sav@@ or ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les .
We need to sav@@ or sm@@ all@@ er por@@ tions of se@@ a@@ food .
And we need to s@@ ave din@@ ner .
Thank you .
( Applause )
H@@ i . I am an ar@@ chit@@ ect .
"I am the only ar@@ chit@@ ect in the world making buil@@ din@@ gs out of pa@@ per like this car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard tu@@ be , and this ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition is the first one I did using pa@@ per tu@@ b@@ es ."
"@@ 19@@ 8@@ 6 , much , much longer before people started talking about ec@@ olog@@ ical issu@@ es and environ@@ mental issu@@ es , I just started test@@ ing the pa@@ per tu@@ be in order to use this as a building structure ."
"It &apos;s very comp@@ lic@@ ated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stron@@ ger than I expe@@ cted , and also it &apos;s very easy to wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and also , because it &apos;s industri@@ al material , it &apos;s also possible to fi@@ re@@ pro@@ of ."
"Th@@ en I built the tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry structure , 199@@ 0 ."
This is the first tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry building made out of pa@@ per .
"There are 3@@ 30 tu@@ b@@ es , di@@ am@@ et@@ er 5@@ 5 &#91; cent@@ im@@ et@@ ers &#93; , there are only 12 tu@@ b@@ es with a di@@ am@@ et@@ er of 1@@ 20 cent@@ im@@ et@@ ers , or four fe@@ et , wi@@ de ."
"As you see it in the p@@ ho@@ to , inside is the to@@ il@@ et ."
"In case you &apos;re fin@@ ish@@ ed with to@@ il@@ et pa@@ per , you can te@@ ar off the inside of the w@@ all . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very u@@ se@@ ful ."
"@@ Ye@@ ar 20@@ 00 , there was a big ex@@ po in Ger@@ many ."
"I was asked to design the building , because the them@@ e of the ex@@ po was environ@@ mental issu@@ es ."
"So I was cho@@ se@@ n to build the p@@ av@@ ili@@ on out of pa@@ per tu@@ b@@ es , rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able pa@@ per ."
My go@@ al of the design is not when it &apos;s complet@@ ed .
"My go@@ al was when the building was de@@ mol@@ ish@@ ed , because each country makes a lot of p@@ av@@ ili@@ ons but after half a year , we create a lot of industri@@ al w@@ ast@@ e , so my building has to be re@@ used or rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
"A@@ f@@ ter , the building was rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
So that was the go@@ al of my design .
Th@@ en I was very lu@@ ck@@ y to w@@ in the comp@@ et@@ ition to build the second P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ ent@@ er in Fran@@ ce in the city of M@@ et@@ z .
"Because I was so po@@ or , I wanted to r@@ ent an off@@ ice in Par@@ is , but I couldn &apos;t af@@ for@@ d it , so I decided to bring my students to Par@@ is to build our off@@ ice on top of the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ ent@@ er in Par@@ is by ourselves ."
So we b@@ rou@@ ght the pa@@ per tu@@ b@@ es and the wo@@ od@@ en jo@@ in@@ ts to compl@@ ete the 3@@ 5@@ -@@ met@@ er@@ -@@ long off@@ ice .
We sta@@ yed there for six years without pa@@ ying any r@@ ent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
"Because we were part of the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to bu@@ y a ti@@ ck@@ et to see me ."
That was the problem .
Th@@ en I complet@@ ed the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ ent@@ er in M@@ et@@ z .
"It &apos;s a very popul@@ ar mu@@ se@@ um now , and I created a big mon@@ u@@ ment for the government ."
"But then I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted at my profes@@ sion as an ar@@ chit@@ ect , because we are not hel@@ ping , we are not working for society , but we are working for priv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed people , ri@@ ch people , government , devel@@ oper@@ s ."
They have money and power .
Th@@ ose are in@@ vi@@ sible .
So they hi@@ re us to vis@@ u@@ aliz@@ e their power and money by making mon@@ u@@ mental ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ture .
"That is our profes@@ sion , even hist@@ or@@ ically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same ."
"So I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their hou@@ ses by natural dis@@ ast@@ ers ."
But I must say they are no longer natural dis@@ ast@@ ers .
"For example , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es never k@@ ill people , but col@@ la@@ p@@ se of the buil@@ din@@ gs k@@ ill people ."
That &apos;s the respon@@ sibil@@ ity of ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ts .
"Th@@ en people need some tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry hou@@ sing , but there are no ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ts working there because we are too bu@@ sy working for priv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed people ."
"So I thought , even as ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ts , we can be invol@@ ved in the re@@ con@@ stru@@ ction of tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry hou@@ sing ."
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in dis@@ aster are@@ as .
"@@ 199@@ 4 , there was a big dis@@ aster in R@@ wan@@ da , Africa ."
"T@@ w@@ o tri@@ b@@ es , H@@ ut@@ u and T@@ u@@ ts@@ i , f@@ ou@@ ght each other ."
O@@ ver two million people became re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
"But I was so surpri@@ sed to see the sh@@ el@@ ter , re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee cam@@ p organiz@@ ed by the U.@@ N@@ ."
"They &apos;re so po@@ or , and they are fre@@ ez@@ ing with bl@@ an@@ k@@ ets during the ra@@ iny se@@ as@@ on , In the sh@@ el@@ ters built by the U.@@ N@@ . , they were just pro@@ vid@@ ing a plast@@ ic she@@ et , and the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es had to c@@ ut the tre@@ es , and just like this ."
But over two million people c@@ ut tre@@ es .
"It just became big , he@@ av@@ y de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation and an environ@@ mental problem ."
"That is why they started pro@@ vid@@ ing al@@ um@@ in@@ um pi@@ p@@ es , al@@ um@@ in@@ um bar@@ ra@@ cks ."
"V@@ ery ex@@ pen@@ sive , they th@@ row them out for money , then c@@ ut@@ ting tre@@ es again ."
"So I pro@@ posed my idea to impro@@ ve the situ@@ ation using these rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed pa@@ per tu@@ b@@ es because this is so che@@ a@@ p and also so stron@@ g , but my bud@@ get is only 50 U.@@ S. dollars per un@@ it ."
"We built 50 un@@ its to do that as a mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing test for the du@@ ra@@ bil@@ ity and mo@@ ist@@ ure and ter@@ m@@ it@@ es , so on ."
"And then , year af@@ ter@@ ward , 199@@ 5 , in K@@ ob@@ e , J@@ ap@@ an , we had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke ."
"N@@ early 7@@ ,000 people were kill@@ ed , and the city like this N@@ ag@@ at@@ a di@@ stri@@ ct , all the city was bur@@ ned in a fi@@ re after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke ."
And also I found out there &apos;s many V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ m@@ ese re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es su@@ ff@@ ering and ga@@ ther@@ ing at a C@@ a@@ th@@ ol@@ ic ch@@ ur@@ ch — all the building was tot@@ ally dest@@ ro@@ yed .
"So I went there and also I pro@@ posed to the pri@@ est@@ s , &quot; Why don &apos;t we re@@ build the ch@@ ur@@ ch out of pa@@ per tu@@ b@@ es ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh G@@ od , are you c@@ raz@@ y ?"
"A@@ f@@ ter a fi@@ re , what are you pro@@ pos@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; So he never tru@@ st@@ ed me , but I didn &apos;t give up ."
"I started com@@ mu@@ ting to K@@ ob@@ e , and I met the society of V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ m@@ ese people ."
They were living like this with very po@@ or plast@@ ic she@@ ets in the par@@ k .
So I pro@@ posed to re@@ build . I ra@@ is@@ ed — did fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing .
"I made a pa@@ per tu@@ be sh@@ el@@ ter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to de@@ mol@@ ish , I used be@@ er c@@ rat@@ es as a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
"I asked the K@@ ir@@ in be@@ er company to pro@@ pose , because at that time , the A@@ sa@@ h@@ i be@@ er company made their plast@@ ic be@@ er c@@ rat@@ es red , which doesn &apos;t go with the col@@ or of the pa@@ per tu@@ b@@ es ."
The col@@ or co@@ ordin@@ ation is very important .
"And also I still remember , we were expe@@ c@@ ting to have a be@@ er inside the plast@@ ic be@@ er c@@ rate , but it came em@@ p@@ ty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting ."
"So during the sum@@ mer with my students , we built over 50 un@@ its of the sh@@ el@@ ters ."
"F@@ in@@ ally the pri@@ est , finally he tru@@ st@@ ed me to re@@ build ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you colle@@ ct money by y@@ ourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we sp@@ ent five we@@ eks re@@ building the ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"It was me@@ ant to st@@ ay there for three years , but actually it sta@@ yed there 10 years because people lov@@ ed it ."
"Th@@ en , in Ta@@ i@@ w@@ an , they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , and we pro@@ posed to don@@ ate this ch@@ ur@@ ch , so we dis@@ man@@ t@@ led them , we s@@ ent them over to be built by vol@@ un@@ te@@ er people ."
It sta@@ yed there in Ta@@ i@@ w@@ an as a per@@ man@@ ent ch@@ ur@@ ch even now .
So this building became a per@@ man@@ ent building .
"Th@@ en I won@@ der , what is a per@@ man@@ ent and what is a tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry building ?"
E@@ ven a building made in pa@@ per can be per@@ man@@ ent as long as people love it .
E@@ ven a con@@ cre@@ te building can be very tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry if that is made to make money .
"In 199@@ 9 , in T@@ ur@@ key , the big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , I went there to use the local material to build a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"@@ 200@@ 1 , in W@@ est India , I built also a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"In 200@@ 4 , in S@@ ri L@@ an@@ ka , after the S@@ um@@ at@@ ra ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke and t@@ su@@ nami , I re@@ built I@@ sl@@ am@@ ic fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men &apos;s v@@ ill@@ ages ."
"And in 200@@ 8 , in Ch@@ eng@@ du , S@@ ich@@ u@@ an area in China , ne@@ arly 7@@ 0,000 people were kill@@ ed , and also es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally many of the scho@@ ols were dest@@ ro@@ yed because of the cor@@ rup@@ tion between the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and the con@@ tra@@ c@@ tor ."
I was asked to re@@ build the tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry ch@@ ur@@ ch .
I b@@ rou@@ ght my J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students to work with the Ch@@ in@@ ese students .
"In one mon@@ th , we complet@@ ed n@@ ine clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s , over 500 squ@@ are met@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s still used , even after the cur@@ r@@ ent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke in China ."
"In 200@@ 9 , in I@@ tal@@ y , L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ ila , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke ."
"And this is a very interesting p@@ ho@@ to : form@@ er Pri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er Pri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er M@@ r@@ . A@@ so — you know , because we have to change the pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er ever year ."
"And they are very kind , af@@ for@@ ding my model ."
"I pro@@ posed a big re@@ building , a tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry music h@@ all , because L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ ila is very fam@@ ous for music and all the con@@ cer@@ t h@@ all@@ s were dest@@ ro@@ yed , so mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans were moving out ."
"So I pro@@ posed to the ma@@ y@@ or , I &apos;d like to re@@ build the tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry au@@ dit@@ ori@@ um ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lu@@ ck@@ y ."
"M@@ r@@ . B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i b@@ rou@@ ght G@@ 8 sum@@ m@@ it , and our form@@ er pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er came , so they hel@@ ped us to colle@@ ct money , and I got half a million e@@ uro@@ s from the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese government to re@@ build this tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry au@@ dit@@ ori@@ um ."
"@@ Ye@@ ar 20@@ 10 in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , there was a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , but it &apos;s im@@ possible to f@@ ly over , so I went to S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go , ne@@ x@@ t-@@ do@@ or country , to dri@@ ve six hours to get to H@@ a@@ it@@ i with the local students in S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go to build 50 un@@ its of sh@@ el@@ ter out of local pa@@ per tu@@ b@@ es ."
"This is what happened in J@@ ap@@ an two years ago , in nor@@ ther@@ n J@@ ap@@ an ."
"A@@ f@@ ter the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke and t@@ su@@ nami , people had to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated in a big room like a g@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um ."
But look at this . There &apos;s no priv@@ ac@@ y .
P@@ eople su@@ ff@@ er men@@ t@@ ally and physi@@ cally .
"So we went there to build part@@ itions with all the stud@@ ent vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with pa@@ per tu@@ b@@ es , just a very simple sh@@ el@@ ter out of the tu@@ be fra@@ me and the cur@@ tain ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , some of the fac@@ il@@ ity au@@ th@@ or@@ ity doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them ."
But it &apos;s really ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough fl@@ at area to build stan@@ d@@ ard government sing@@ le@@ -@@ story hou@@ sing like this one .
"L@@ o@@ ok at this . E@@ ven ci@@ vil government is doing such po@@ or con@@ stru@@ ction of the tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry hou@@ sing , so den@@ se and so mes@@ sy because there is no stor@@ age , nothing , water is lea@@ king , so I thought , we have to make mul@@ ti@@ -@@ story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very com@@ for@@ table ."
So I pro@@ posed to the ma@@ y@@ or while I was making part@@ itions .
F@@ in@@ ally I met a very ni@@ ce ma@@ y@@ or in O@@ na@@ ga@@ w@@ a v@@ ill@@ age in M@@ i@@ y@@ ag@@ i .
He asked me to build thre@@ e-@@ story hou@@ sing on ba@@ se@@ b@@ all &#91; fiel@@ ds &#93; .
"I used the shi@@ pp@@ ing con@@ tain@@ er and also the students hel@@ ped us to make all the building f@@ ur@@ nit@@ ure to make them com@@ for@@ table , within the bud@@ get of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more com@@ for@@ table ."
M@@ any of the people want to st@@ ay here fore@@ ver .
I was very happy to hear that .
"Now I am working in New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"A@@ b@@ out 20 days before the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke happened , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , and many J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students were also kill@@ ed , and the most important ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral of the city , the sym@@ bo@@ l of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch , was tot@@ ally dest@@ ro@@ yed ."
And I was asked to come to re@@ build the tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral .
So this is under con@@ stru@@ ction .
And I &apos;d like to keep building mon@@ u@@ ments that are bel@@ ov@@ ed by people .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What is going on in this bab@@ y &apos;s mind ?
"If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , inclu@@ ding p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ sts , would have said that this bab@@ y was ir@@ r@@ ational , il@@ lo@@ g@@ ical , e@@ go@@ cent@@ ri@@ c — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspe@@ ctive of another person or understand c@@ ause and eff@@ ect ."
"In the last 20 years , develop@@ mental science has completely over@@ turned that picture ."
"So in some ways , we think that this bab@@ y &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most br@@ illi@@ ant scientists ."
Let me give you just one example of this .
"One thing that this bab@@ y could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other bab@@ y ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , one of the things that &apos;s har@@ d@@ est for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feel@@ ing ."
And maybe the har@@ d@@ est thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
A@@ ny@@ one who &apos;s fol@@ lo@@ wed polit@@ ics can t@@ esti@@ fy to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if bab@@ ies and young children could understand this really pro@@ found thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
"B@@ ab@@ ies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year@@ -@@ old to tell you what he thin@@ ks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stre@@ am of consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess mo@@ nolo@@ gu@@ e about po@@ ni@@ es and bir@@ th@@ days and things like that ."
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the se@@ cre@@ t was bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
"What we did — B@@ et@@ ty R@@ a@@ pa@@ ch@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the bab@@ ies two bo@@ w@@ ls of food : one bo@@ w@@ l of ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bo@@ w@@ l of del@@ ici@@ ous gol@@ d@@ fish cra@@ ck@@ ers ."
"Now all of the bab@@ ies , even in B@@ er@@ k@@ le@@ y , like the cra@@ ck@@ ers and don &apos;t like the ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
( Laughter ) But then what B@@ et@@ ty did was to take a little ta@@ st@@ e of food from each bo@@ w@@ l .
And she would act as if she li@@ ked it or she didn &apos;t .
"So half the time , she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the cra@@ ck@@ ers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i — just like a bab@@ y and any other san@@ e person ."
"But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m , bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"I ta@@ st@@ ed the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i . M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the cra@@ ck@@ ers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , y@@ u@@ ck , cra@@ ck@@ ers ."
"I ta@@ st@@ ed the cra@@ ck@@ ers . E@@ w@@ w , y@@ u@@ ck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the op@@ pos@@ ite of what the bab@@ ies wanted ."
We did this with 15 and 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies .
"And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; C@@ an you give me some ? &quot;"
"So the question is : What would the bab@@ y give her , what they li@@ ked or what she li@@ ked ?"
"And the rem@@ ar@@ ka@@ ble thing was that 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies , just b@@ are@@ ly wal@@ king and talking , would give her the cra@@ ck@@ ers if she li@@ ked the cra@@ ck@@ ers , but they would give her the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"On the other hand , 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds would st@@ are at her for a long time if she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out ."
"But then after they sta@@ red for a long time , they would just give her the cra@@ ck@@ ers , what they thought everybody must like ."
So there are two really rem@@ ar@@ ka@@ ble things about this .
"The first one is that these little 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies have already discover@@ ed this really pro@@ found fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing ."
"And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted ."
"E@@ ven more rem@@ ar@@ ka@@ bly though , the fact that 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds didn &apos;t do this su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that these 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds had learned this de@@ ep , pro@@ found fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old ."
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hun@@ dre@@ ds and hun@@ dre@@ ds of studi@@ es over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demon@@ strat@@ ed it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a shor@@ t time ?
"I mean , after all , if you look at bab@@ ies super@@ f@@ ici@@ ally , they se@@ em pretty us@@ el@@ ess ."
"And actually in many ways , they &apos;re wor@@ se than us@@ el@@ ess , because we have to put so much time and energy into just ke@@ ep@@ ing them ali@@ ve ."
"But if we turn to evol@@ ution for an answer to this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of why we spend so much time taking care of us@@ el@@ ess bab@@ ies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer ."
"If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pri@@ mat@@ es , but also inclu@@ ding other mam@@ mal@@ s , bir@@ ds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like kan@@ ga@@ ro@@ os and wom@@ bat@@ s , it turns out that there &apos;s a relation@@ ship between how long a chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od a species has and how big their bra@@ ins are com@@ pa@@ red to their bod@@ ies and how sm@@ art and fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble they are ."
And sort of the post@@ er@@ bir@@ ds for this idea are the bir@@ ds up there .
On one side is a New C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ i@@ an c@@ row .
"And c@@ ro@@ ws and other cor@@ vi@@ da@@ e , rav@@ ens , ro@@ oks and so for@@ th , are incredi@@ bly sm@@ art bir@@ ds ."
They &apos;re as sm@@ art as ch@@ im@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ es in some re@@ spe@@ c@@ ts .
And this is a bir@@ d on the c@@ over of science who &apos;s learned how to use a to@@ ol to get food .
"On the other hand , we have our friend the dom@@ est@@ ic ch@@ ick@@ en ."
And ch@@ ick@@ ens and duc@@ ks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ ke@@ ys are basically as dum@@ b as dum@@ ps .
"So they &apos;re very , very good at pe@@ c@@ king for gra@@ in , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else ."
"Well it turns out that the bab@@ ies , the New C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ i@@ an c@@ row bab@@ ies , are f@@ led@@ gl@@ ings ."
"They de@@ p@@ end on their mo@@ ms to dro@@ p wor@@ ms in their little open m@@ ou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bir@@ d ."
Wh@@ ere@@ as the ch@@ ick@@ ens are actually mat@@ ure within a couple of months .
So chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od is the reason why the c@@ ro@@ ws end up on the c@@ over of S@@ ci@@ ence and the ch@@ ick@@ ens end up in the s@@ ou@@ p po@@ t .
There &apos;s something about that long chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od that se@@ ems to be conne@@ cted to knowled@@ ge and learning .
Well what kind of ex@@ plan@@ ation could we have for this ?
"Well some animals , like the ch@@ ick@@ en , se@@ em to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to doing just one thing very well ."
So they se@@ em to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to pe@@ c@@ king gra@@ in in one environment .
"O@@ ther cre@@ at@@ ures , like the c@@ ro@@ ws , are@@ n &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely good at learning about la@@ ws of different environ@@ ments ."
"And of course , we human be@@ ings are way out on the end of the di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion like the c@@ ro@@ ws ."
We have bi@@ g@@ ger bra@@ ins rel@@ ative to our bod@@ ies by far than any other anim@@ al .
"We &apos;re sm@@ ar@@ ter , we &apos;re more fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble , we can learn more , we survi@@ ve in more different environ@@ ments , we mi@@ g@@ rat@@ ed to c@@ over the world and even go to ou@@ ter space ."
And our bab@@ ies and children are de@@ pen@@ dent on us for much longer than the bab@@ ies of any other species .
My son is 2@@ 3 .
"( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 2@@ 3 , we &apos;re still po@@ pp@@ ing those wor@@ ms into those little open m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"A@@ ll right , why would we see this cor@@ rel@@ ation ?"
"Well an idea is that that strate@@ gy , that learning strate@@ gy , is an ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely powerful , great strate@@ gy for getting on in the world , but it has one big dis@@ adv@@ anta@@ ge ."
"And that one big dis@@ adv@@ anta@@ ge is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be hel@@ pl@@ ess ."
"So you don &apos;t want to have the ma@@ st@@ od@@ on ch@@ ar@@ ging at you and be saying to y@@ ourself , &quot; A sl@@ ing@@ sh@@ ot or maybe a spe@@ ar might work . Wh@@ ich would actually be better ? &quot;"
You want to know all that before the ma@@ st@@ od@@ ons actually show up .
And the way the evol@@ utions se@@ ems to have sol@@ ved that problem is with a kind of di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely prote@@ cted .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
"And then as a@@ du@@ l@@ ts , we can take all those things that we learned when we were bab@@ ies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world ."
So one way of thinking about it is that bab@@ ies and young children are like the research and develop@@ ment di@@ vision of the human species .
"So they &apos;re the prote@@ cted bl@@ ue sk@@ y guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re produc@@ tion and mark@@ et@@ ing ."
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
"A@@ no@@ ther way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of bab@@ ies and children as being like def@@ ec@@ tive grow@@ nu@@ ps , we should think about them as being a different develop@@ mental stage of the same species — kind of like cat@@ er@@ p@@ ill@@ ar@@ s and bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es — exc@@ ept that they &apos;re actually the br@@ illi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es who are f@@ lit@@ ting around the gar@@ den and expl@@ or@@ ing , and we &apos;re the cat@@ er@@ p@@ ill@@ ar@@ s who are in@@ ching along our nar@@ row , grow@@ nu@@ p , a@@ du@@ l@@ t pat@@ h ."
"If this is true , if these bab@@ ies are desig@@ ned to learn — and this evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expe@@ ct that they would have really powerful learning me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms ."
"And in fact , the bab@@ y &apos;s brain se@@ ems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet ."
But real compu@@ ters are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a revol@@ ution in our under@@ standing of machine learning rec@@ ently .
"And it all de@@ pen@@ ds on the ideas of this guy , the R@@ ever@@ end Th@@ om@@ as B@@ a@@ yes , who was a stati@@ st@@ ici@@ an and ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ an in the 1@@ 8@@ th century ."
"And es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally what B@@ a@@ yes did was to pro@@ vide a ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal way using prob@@ ability the@@ ory to charac@@ ter@@ ize , descri@@ be , the way that scientists find out about the world ."
So what scientists do is they have a hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is that they think might be lik@@ ely to start with .
They go out and test it against the evid@@ ence .
The evid@@ ence makes them change that hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is .
Th@@ en they test that new hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is and so on and so for@@ th .
And what B@@ a@@ yes sho@@ wed was a ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal way that you could do that .
And that ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs is at the cor@@ e of the best machine learning progra@@ ms that we have now .
"And some 10 years ago , I su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed that bab@@ ies might be doing the same thing ."
"So if you want to know what &apos;s going on under@@ ne@@ ath those beautiful bro@@ wn eyes , I think it actually looks something like this ."
This is R@@ ever@@ end B@@ a@@ yes &apos;s not@@ e@@ book .
So I think those bab@@ ies are actually making comp@@ lic@@ ated cal@@ cul@@ ations with cond@@ iti@@ onal prob@@ abil@@ ities that they &apos;re re@@ vis@@ ing to figure out how the world works .
"A@@ ll right , now that might se@@ em like an even t@@ all@@ er order to actually demon@@ str@@ ate ."
"Because after all , if you ask even grow@@ nu@@ ps about stati@@ st@@ ics , they look ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely stup@@ id ."
How could it be that children are doing stati@@ st@@ ics ?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the B@@ lic@@ k@@ et D@@ et@@ ec@@ tor .
This is a bo@@ x that li@@ ghts up and pla@@ ys music when you put some things on it and not others .
"And using this very simple machine , my la@@ b and others have done do@@ z@@ ens of studi@@ es sho@@ wing just how good bab@@ ies are at learning about the world ."
"L@@ et me men@@ tion just one that we did with T@@ uma@@ r K@@ ush@@ ner , my stud@@ ent ."
"If I sho@@ wed you this det@@ ec@@ tor , you would be lik@@ ely to think to beg@@ in with that the way to make the det@@ ec@@ tor go would be to put a blo@@ ck on top of the det@@ ec@@ tor ."
"But actually , this det@@ ec@@ tor works in a bit of a stran@@ ge way ."
"Because if you w@@ ave a blo@@ ck over the top of the det@@ ec@@ tor , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to beg@@ in with , the det@@ ec@@ tor will actually activ@@ ate two out of three times ."
"Wh@@ ere@@ as , if you do the lik@@ ely thing , put the blo@@ ck on the det@@ ec@@ tor , it will only activ@@ ate two out of six times ."
So the un@@ lik@@ ely hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is actually has stron@@ ger evid@@ ence .
It looks as if the w@@ av@@ ing is a more effec@@ tive strate@@ gy than the other strate@@ gy .
"So we did just this ; we gave four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds this patter@@ n of evid@@ ence , and we just asked them to make it go ."
"And sure enough , the four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds used the evid@@ ence to w@@ ave the ob@@ ject on top of the det@@ ec@@ tor ."
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
"The first one is , again , remember , these are four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds ."
They &apos;re just learning how to coun@@ t .
"But un@@ consci@@ ously , they &apos;re doing these quite comp@@ lic@@ ated cal@@ cul@@ ations that will give them a cond@@ iti@@ onal prob@@ ability meas@@ ure ."
"And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evid@@ ence to get to an idea , get to a hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is about the world , that se@@ ems very un@@ lik@@ ely to beg@@ in with ."
"And in studi@@ es we &apos;ve just been doing in my la@@ b , si@@ mil@@ ar studi@@ es , we &apos;ve show that four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds are actually better at fin@@ ding out an un@@ lik@@ ely hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is than a@@ du@@ l@@ ts are when we give them exactly the same ta@@ s@@ k ."
"So in these cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces , the children are using stati@@ st@@ ics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experim@@ ents , and we wanted to see if children are doing experim@@ ents ."
Wh@@ en children do experim@@ ents we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; pla@@ ying . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bu@@ n@@ ch of interesting studi@@ es rec@@ ently that have sho@@ wn this pla@@ ying around is really a kind of experim@@ en@@ tal research progra@@ m .
Here &apos;s one from C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine L@@ eg@@ are &apos;s la@@ b .
What C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine did was use our B@@ lic@@ k@@ et D@@ et@@ ec@@ tors .
"And what she did was show children that y@@ el@@ low ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she sho@@ wed them an an@@ om@@ al@@ y ."
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little bo@@ y will go through five hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es in the space of two minutes .
( V@@ ideo ) Bo@@ y : How about this ?
S@@ ame as the other side .
"A@@ li@@ son G@@ op@@ nik : O@@ kay , so his first hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is has just been f@@ al@@ si@@ fi@@ ed ."
"( Laughter ) Bo@@ y : This one li@@ gh@@ ted up , and this one nothing ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , he &apos;s got his experim@@ en@@ tal not@@ e@@ book out ."
Bo@@ y : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
A@@ G : E@@ very sci@@ ent@@ ist will recogniz@@ e that ex@@ pres@@ sion of des@@ pa@@ ir .
"( Laughter ) Bo@@ y : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is two ."
Bo@@ y : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Now this is his next idea .
"He told the experim@@ ent@@ er to do this , to try put@@ ting it out on@@ to the other lo@@ c@@ ation ."
N@@ ot working ei@@ ther .
"B@@ o@@ y : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here ."
"O@@ h , the bot@@ tom of this bo@@ x has electri@@ city in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electri@@ city ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , that &apos;s a f@@ our@@ th hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is ."
Bo@@ y : It &apos;s li@@ gh@@ ting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , there &apos;s his fi@@ f@@ th hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is ."
"Now that is a particul@@ arly — that is a particul@@ arly ad@@ or@@ able and arti@@ cul@@ ate little bo@@ y , but what C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine discover@@ ed is this is actually quite ty@@ p@@ ical ."
"If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to expla@@ in something , what they really do is do a seri@@ es of experim@@ ents ."
This is actually pretty ty@@ p@@ ical of four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds .
"Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of cre@@ ature ?"
What &apos;s it like to be one of these br@@ illi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es who can test five hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es in two minutes ?
"Well , if you go back to those p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ sts and ph@@ il@@ oso@@ ph@@ ers , a lot of them have said that bab@@ ies and young children were b@@ are@@ ly consci@@ ous if they were consci@@ ous at all ."
And I think just the op@@ pos@@ ite is true .
I think bab@@ ies and children are actually more consci@@ ous than we are as a@@ du@@ l@@ ts .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how a@@ du@@ l@@ t consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess works .
And a@@ du@@ l@@ ts &apos; atten@@ tion and consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess look kind of like a s@@ pot@@ light .
"So what happens for a@@ du@@ l@@ ts is we deci@@ de that something &apos;s re@@ lev@@ ant or important , we should p@@ ay atten@@ tion to it ."
"O@@ ur consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess of that thing that we &apos;re atten@@ ding to be@@ comes ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely b@@ right and vi@@ vid , and everything else sort of goes dar@@ k ."
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
"So what happens when we p@@ ay atten@@ tion is that the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x , the sort of ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive part of our bra@@ ins , sen@@ ds a sig@@ nal that makes a little part of our brain much more fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble , more plast@@ ic , better at learning , and sh@@ ut@@ s down activ@@ ity in all the re@@ st of our bra@@ ins ."
"So we have a very foc@@ used , pur@@ pos@@ e-@@ dri@@ ven kind of atten@@ tion ."
"If we look at bab@@ ies and young children , we see something very different ."
I think bab@@ ies and young children se@@ em to have more of a lan@@ ter@@ n of consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess than a s@@ pot@@ light of consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess .
So bab@@ ies and young children are very bad at nar@@ ro@@ wing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sour@@ ces at once .
"And if you actually look in their bra@@ ins , you see that they &apos;re flo@@ od@@ ed with these ne@@ uro@@ tran@@ sm@@ it@@ ters that are really good at in@@ duc@@ ing learning and plast@@ ic@@ ity , and the in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ory parts hav@@ en &apos;t come on yet ."
"So when we say that bab@@ ies and young children are bad at pa@@ ying atten@@ tion , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not pa@@ ying atten@@ tion ."
So they &apos;re bad at getting ri@@ d of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
"That &apos;s the kind of atten@@ tion , the kind of consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess , that we might expe@@ ct from those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es who are desig@@ ned to learn ."
"Well if we want to think about a way of getting a ta@@ st@@ e of that kind of bab@@ y consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess as a@@ du@@ l@@ ts , I think the best thing is think about c@@ ases where we &apos;re put in a new situ@@ ation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we f@@ all in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time ."
"And what happens then is not that our consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts , it ex@@ pan@@ ds , so that those three days in Par@@ is se@@ em to be more full of consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess and experience than all the months of being a wal@@ king , talking , fac@@ ul@@ ty me@@ et@@ ing@@ -@@ atten@@ ding z@@ om@@ bi@@ e back home ."
"And by the way , that co@@ ff@@ ee , that wonderful co@@ ff@@ ee you &apos;ve been d@@ rin@@ king do@@ w@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s , actually m@@ im@@ ics the eff@@ ect of those bab@@ y ne@@ uro@@ tran@@ sm@@ it@@ ters ."
So what &apos;s it like to be a bab@@ y ?
It &apos;s like being in love in Par@@ is for the first time after you &apos;ve had three d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ es@@ pres@@ so@@ s .
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fanta@@ st@@ ic way to be , but it does t@@ end to leave you wa@@ king up c@@ ry@@ ing at three o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the mor@@ ning . ( Laughter )"
Now it &apos;s good to be a grow@@ nu@@ p .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful bab@@ ies are .
It &apos;s good to be a grow@@ nu@@ p .
We can do things like ti@@ e our sho@@ el@@ ac@@ es and c@@ ross the stre@@ et by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of ef@@ for@@ t into making bab@@ ies think like a@@ du@@ l@@ ts do .
"But if what we want is to be like those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es , to have op@@ en@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , open learning , imag@@ in@@ ation , cre@@ ativ@@ ity , innov@@ ation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the a@@ du@@ l@@ ts to start thinking more like children ."

"In N@@ ov@@ ember of 200@@ 3 , I was inv@@ ited to take part in the lau@@ n@@ ch of N@@ el@@ son M@@ an@@ dela &apos;s 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation — that is his H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
And 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 is the number that M@@ an@@ dela had when he was im@@ pri@@ s@@ on@@ ed in R@@ ob@@ b@@ en I@@ sl@@ and .
"And that &apos;s me with Y@@ ous@@ s@@ ou N &apos;@@ D@@ our , on@@ stage , having the time of my life ."
"The next day , all the arti@@ sts were inv@@ ited to jo@@ in M@@ an@@ dela in R@@ ob@@ b@@ en I@@ sl@@ and , where he was going to give a con@@ fer@@ ence to the world &apos;s pres@@ s , standing in front of his form@@ er pri@@ son cell ."
You can see the bar@@ s of the win@@ do@@ w there .
It was quite a momen@@ t@@ ous oc@@ ca@@ sion for all of us .
"In that moment in time , M@@ an@@ dela told the world &apos;s pres@@ s that there was a vir@@ tual gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de taking place in his country ; that post@@ -@@ a@@ par@@ the@@ id R@@ a@@ in@@ b@@ ow N@@ ation , a thou@@ s@@ and people were d@@ ying on a da@@ ily bas@@ is and that the front line vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s , the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able of all , were women and children ."
"This was a huge imp@@ act on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I ha@@ dn &apos;t realized that the H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S pan@@ de@@ mic was direc@@ tly aff@@ ec@@ ting women in such a way ."
"And so I comm@@ it@@ ted — when I left S@@ outh Africa , when I left C@@ ap@@ eto@@ wn , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about ."
"I have to ser@@ ve . &quot; &quot; And so , sub@@ sequ@@ ently I parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated in every single 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent that I could take part in and gave news con@@ fer@@ ences , inter@@ vi@@ e@@ ws , talking and using my plat@@ form as a mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an , with my comm@@ it@@ ment to M@@ an@@ dela — out of re@@ spe@@ ct for the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous , un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able work that he had done ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ one in the world re@@ spe@@ c@@ ts N@@ el@@ son M@@ an@@ dela , everyone re@@ ver@@ es N@@ el@@ son M@@ an@@ dela ."
"But do they all know about what has been taking place in S@@ outh Africa , his country , the country that had one of the high@@ est in@@ ci@@ d@@ ents of tran@@ sm@@ is@@ sion of the viru@@ s ?"
"I think that if I went out into the stre@@ et now and I told people what was happening there , they would be sho@@ c@@ ked ."
"I was very , very for@@ tun@@ ate a couple of years later to have met Z@@ ac@@ kie A@@ ch@@ m@@ at , the f@@ oun@@ der of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , an incredi@@ ble cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ner and activ@@ ist ."
I met him at a 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent .
He was w@@ ear@@ ing a t-@@ shi@@ r@@ t like the one I we@@ ar now .
"This is a to@@ ol — this tel@@ ls you I am in sol@@ id@@ ar@@ ity with people who have H@@ I@@ V , people who are living with H@@ I@@ V ."
"And in a way because of the st@@ ig@@ ma , by w@@ ear@@ ing this t-@@ shi@@ r@@ t I say , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , we can talk about this issue ."
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the clo@@ set . &quot; &quot; I became a mem@@ ber of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n and I &apos;m very pro@@ u@@ d to be a mem@@ ber of that incredi@@ ble organiz@@ ation .
"It &apos;s a g@@ ras@@ s@@ ro@@ ots cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n with 80 percent mem@@ ber@@ ship being women , most of wh@@ om are H@@ I@@ V@@ -@@ pos@@ itive ."
They work in the fiel@@ d .
They have tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous ou@@ tre@@ ach to the people who are living direc@@ tly with the effec@@ ts of the viru@@ s .
They have education progra@@ ms .
They bring out the issu@@ es of st@@ ig@@ ma .
It &apos;s quite extra@@ ordin@@ ary what they do .
"And yes , my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n has sup@@ por@@ ted T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n in the way that I have tri@@ ed to ra@@ ise a@@ war@@ en@@ ess and to try to also ra@@ ise fun@@ ds ."
"A lot of the fun@@ ding that I have manag@@ ed to ra@@ ise has gone direc@@ tly to T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n and the incredi@@ ble work that they do , and are still contin@@ u@@ ing to do in S@@ outh Africa ."
So this is my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to sup@@ port me .
I &apos;ve trav@@ el@@ ed all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
"H@@ ere I am in O@@ sl@@ o in Nor@@ way , getting a ni@@ ce , f@@ at ch@@ ec@@ k ; sing@@ ing in H@@ ong K@@ ong , trying to get people to ra@@ ise money ."
"In J@@ o@@ han@@ nes@@ bur@@ g , I had the opport@@ unity to play to a ma@@ in@@ ly white , mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ clas@@ s S@@ outh Afri@@ can audi@@ ence who en@@ ded up in te@@ ar@@ s because I use fil@@ m c@@ li@@ ps that really tou@@ ch the heart , the whole nature , of this ter@@ ri@@ ble tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y that is taking place , that people are ten@@ ding to av@@ o@@ id , because they are f@@ ati@@ gu@@ ed , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the sol@@ utions are ."
"A@@ a@@ ro@@ n M@@ ot@@ so@@ al@@ ed@@ i , the cur@@ r@@ ent health min@@ ist@@ er , atten@@ ded that con@@ cer@@ t and I had an opport@@ unity to me@@ et with him , and he gave his absol@@ ute comm@@ it@@ ment to try to making a change , which is absol@@ ut@@ ely ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ary ."
This is in the S@@ c@@ ot@@ t@@ ish Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent .
I &apos;ve sub@@ sequ@@ ently become an en@@ vo@@ y for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land and H@@ I@@ V .
"And I was sho@@ wing them my experi@@ ences and trying to , again , ra@@ ise a@@ war@@ en@@ ess ."
"And once again , in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh with the wonderful Afri@@ can Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s C@@ ho@@ ir who I simply ad@@ ore ."
"And it &apos;s children like this , many of wh@@ om have been or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed because of their family being aff@@ ec@@ ted by the A@@ I@@ D@@ S viru@@ s ."
I &apos;m sit@@ ting here in New York with M@@ ich@@ el S@@ i@@ di@@ be — he &apos;s the direc@@ tor of U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
"And I &apos;m very ho@@ no@@ red by the fact that M@@ ich@@ el inv@@ ited me , only a few months ago , to become a U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"And in this way , I &apos;ve been str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening my plat@@ form and bro@@ ad@@ ening my ou@@ tre@@ ach ."
The mes@@ sage that U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S are cur@@ r@@ ently sen@@ ding out to the world is that we would like to see the vir@@ tual el@@ im@@ in@@ ation of the tran@@ sm@@ is@@ sion of the viru@@ s from mother to child by 20@@ 15 .
It &apos;s a very am@@ b@@ iti@@ ous go@@ al but we believe it can be achi@@ ev@@ ed with polit@@ ical will .
This can happen .
"And here I am with a pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant woman , who is H@@ I@@ V pos@@ itive and we &apos;re sm@@ il@@ ing , both of us are sm@@ il@@ ing , because we &apos;re very con@@ fi@@ dent , because we know that that young woman is rec@@ ei@@ ving tre@@ at@@ ment so her life can be ex@@ ten@@ ded to take care of the bab@@ y she &apos;s about to give bir@@ th to ."
"And her bab@@ y will rec@@ ei@@ ve P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , which will mean that that bab@@ y can be born free of the viru@@ s ."
Now that is prev@@ en@@ tion at the very beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to start looking at inter@@ ven@@ tion with the A@@ I@@ D@@ S pan@@ de@@ mic .
"Now , I just would like to fin@@ ish off to tell you the little story about A@@ vel@@ ile ."
This is A@@ vel@@ ile — she goes with me wh@@ er@@ ever I go .
I tell her story to everyone because she re@@ pres@@ ents one of milli@@ ons of H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S or@@ ph@@ ans .
A@@ vel@@ ile &apos;s mother had H@@ I@@ V viru@@ s — she di@@ ed from A@@ I@@ D@@ S@@ -@@ rel@@ ated ill@@ ness .
"A@@ vel@@ ile had the viru@@ s , she was born with the viru@@ s ."
"And here she is at se@@ ven years old , we@@ igh@@ ing no more than a one year@@ -@@ old bab@@ y ."
"A@@ t this point in her life , she &apos;s su@@ ff@@ ering with ful@@ l@@ -@@ blo@@ wn A@@ I@@ D@@ S and had p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia ."
We met her in a hosp@@ ital in the E@@ ast@@ er@@ n C@@ ape and sp@@ ent a whole af@@ ter@@ no@@ on with her — an ad@@ or@@ able child .
The doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses were ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
They put her on very speci@@ al nu@@ tr@@ iti@@ ous di@@ et and took great care of her .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hosp@@ ital — because we fil@@ med her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survi@@ ve .
"So , it was obvi@@ ously — it was a very emot@@ i@@ onal en@@ coun@@ ter and left us feel@@ ing very res@@ on@@ ant with this direc@@ t experience , this one child , you know , that story ."
"F@@ i@@ ve months later , we went back to S@@ outh Africa to me@@ et A@@ vel@@ ile again ."
And I &apos;m getting — the ha@@ ir@@ s on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the ha@@ ir@@ s on my ar@@ ms .
They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the trans@@ form@@ ation that took place .
I@@ s@@ n &apos;t it extra@@ ordin@@ ary ?
( Applause ) That round of ap@@ plause is actually for the doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses of the hosp@@ ital who took care of A@@ vel@@ ile .
And I take it that you ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate that kind of trans@@ form@@ ation .
"So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audi@@ ence , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have acc@@ ess to good nu@@ tr@@ ition and good medi@@ cal care , and you believe that the M@@ il@@ len@@ ni@@ um D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ment Go@@ als , speci@@ fic@@ ally five and six , should be absol@@ ut@@ ely comm@@ it@@ ted to by all govern@@ ments around the world — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ ha@@ ran Africa — could you ple@@ ase stand up ."
"I think that &apos;s fa@@ ir to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the h@@ all ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty years ago in the old S@@ ov@@ i@@ et Uni@@ on , a team of engine@@ ers was se@@ cre@@ tly moving a large ob@@ ject through a des@@ ol@@ ate coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
"W@@ ith it , they were ho@@ ping to cap@@ ture the min@@ ds of people every@@ where by being the first to con@@ qu@@ er ou@@ ter space ."
The ro@@ ck@@ et was huge .
And p@@ ac@@ ked in its no@@ se was a sil@@ ver b@@ all with two radi@@ os inside .
"On O@@ c@@ t@@ ob@@ er 4 , 19@@ 5@@ 7 , they lau@@ n@@ ched their ro@@ ck@@ et ."
One of the R@@ us@@ si@@ an scientists w@@ ro@@ te at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call S@@ put@@ nik .
"In the ol@@ den days , expl@@ or@@ ers like V@@ as@@ c@@ o da G@@ am@@ a and C@@ ol@@ um@@ bu@@ s had the good for@@ tu@@ ne to open up the ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al glob@@ e ."
Now we have the good for@@ tu@@ ne to open up space .
"And it is for those in the future to en@@ vy us our jo@@ y . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wat@@ ching sni@@ pp@@ ets from &quot; &quot; S@@ put@@ nik , &quot; &quot; my fi@@ f@@ th do@@ cu@@ men@@ t@@ ary fe@@ ature , which is just about complet@@ ed ."
"It tel@@ ls the story of S@@ put@@ nik , and the story of what happened to America as a resul@@ t ."
"For days after the lau@@ n@@ ch , S@@ put@@ nik was a wonderful cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity ."
"A man@@ -@@ made mo@@ on vi@@ sible by ordin@@ ary c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens , it in@@ spi@@ red a@@ we and pri@@ de that humans had finally lau@@ n@@ ched an ob@@ ject into space ."
"But just three days later , on a day they called R@@ ed M@@ on@@ day , the medi@@ a and the polit@@ ici@@ ans told us , and we beli@@ ev@@ ed , that S@@ put@@ nik was pro@@ of that our en@@ emy had be@@ at@@ en us in science and technology , and that they could now atta@@ ck us with hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en b@@ om@@ b@@ s , using their S@@ put@@ nik ro@@ ck@@ et as an I@@ B@@ M mis@@ s@@ ile ."
All h@@ ell bro@@ ke lo@@ ose .
S@@ put@@ nik quickly became one of the three great sho@@ cks to h@@ it America — h@@ istori@@ ans say the equ@@ al of P@@ ear@@ l H@@ ar@@ bor or 9 / 11 .
It pro@@ vo@@ ked the mis@@ s@@ ile ga@@ p .
It ex@@ plod@@ ed an ar@@ ms ra@@ ce .
It beg@@ an the space ra@@ ce .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in a year , Con@@ gres@@ s fun@@ ded huge we@@ a@@ pon@@ s incre@@ ases , and we went from 1@@ ,@@ 2@@ 00 nu@@ clear we@@ a@@ pon@@ s to 20@@ ,000 ."
And the re@@ ac@@ tions to S@@ put@@ nik went far be@@ y@@ ond we@@ a@@ pon@@ s incre@@ ases .
"For example , some here will remember this day , Ju@@ ne 19@@ 5@@ 8 , the N@@ ational C@@ i@@ vil D@@ ef@@ en@@ se D@@ r@@ ill , where ten@@ s of milli@@ ons of people in 7@@ 8 cities went under@@ ground ."
"O@@ r the G@@ all@@ up P@@ ol@@ l that sho@@ wed that se@@ ven in 10 Americ@@ ans beli@@ ev@@ ed that a nu@@ clear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be kill@@ ed ."
But S@@ put@@ nik pro@@ vo@@ ked wonderful changes as well .
"For example , some in this room went to school on sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship because of S@@ put@@ nik ."
"S@@ up@@ port for engine@@ ering , mat@@ h and science — education in gener@@ al — bo@@ om@@ ed ."
"And V@@ in@@ t C@@ er@@ f poin@@ ts out that S@@ put@@ nik led direc@@ tly to A@@ R@@ P@@ A , and the Internet , and , of course , N@@ A@@ S@@ A ."
My fe@@ ature do@@ cu@@ men@@ t@@ ary shows how a free society can be st@@ am@@ pe@@ ded by those who know how to use medi@@ a .
"But it also shows how we can turn what appe@@ ar@@ s at first to be a bad situ@@ ation , into something that was over@@ all very good for America ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ put@@ nik &quot; &quot; will so@@ on be re@@ le@@ as@@ ed .
"In clo@@ sing , I would like to take a moment to th@@ ank one of my invest@@ ors : lon@@ g@@ time TE@@ D@@ ster , J@@ ay W@@ al@@ k@@ er ."
And I &apos;d like to th@@ ank you all .
( Applause ) .
"Th@@ ank you , Ch@@ ris ."

I &apos;ve been at M@@ I@@ T for 4@@ 4 years .
And the third is a little bit less obvi@@ ous .
"H@@ ave they all ag@@ re@@ ed ? No , not completely ."
I &apos;ll bu@@ y it . I have so much money .
"I have so much money , it takes me fore@@ ver ."
"I gre@@ w up in Bi@@ ha@@ r , India &apos;s po@@ ore@@ st state , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a car@@ t full of the most del@@ ici@@ ous s@@ we@@ ets at our do@@ or@@ step ."
"My bro@@ thers and I du@@ g in , and that &apos;s when my father came home ."
"He was li@@ vid , and I still remember how we cri@@ ed when that car@@ t with our hal@@ f-@@ e@@ at@@ en s@@ we@@ ets was pul@@ led away from us ."
"L@@ ater , I under@@ sto@@ od why my father got so up@@ set ."
Th@@ ose s@@ we@@ ets were a bri@@ be from a con@@ tra@@ c@@ tor who was trying to get my father to a@@ ward him a government con@@ tra@@ ct .
"My father was respon@@ sible for building ro@@ ads in Bi@@ ha@@ r , and he had develop@@ ed a fi@@ r@@ m stance against cor@@ rup@@ tion , even though he was ha@@ ras@@ sed and thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed ."
"H@@ is was a lon@@ ely stru@@ gg@@ le , because Bi@@ ha@@ r was also India &apos;s most cor@@ ru@@ pt state , where public off@@ ici@@ als were en@@ ri@@ ching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than ser@@ ving the po@@ or who had no means to ex@@ pres@@ s their an@@ gu@@ ish if their children had no food or no scho@@ ol@@ ing ."
And I experi@@ en@@ ced this most vis@@ cer@@ ally when I trav@@ el@@ ed to rem@@ ot@@ e v@@ ill@@ ages to study pover@@ ty .
"And as I went v@@ ill@@ age to v@@ ill@@ age , I remember one day , when I was fam@@ ish@@ ed and ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ ed , and I was almost col@@ la@@ p@@ sing in a sc@@ or@@ ching he@@ at under a tre@@ e , and just at that time , one of the po@@ ore@@ st men in that v@@ ill@@ age inv@@ ited me into his h@@ ut and gra@@ ci@@ ously f@@ ed me ."
O@@ n@@ ly I later realized that what he f@@ ed me was food for his entire family for two days .
This pro@@ found gi@@ ft of gener@@ os@@ ity chall@@ eng@@ ed and changed the very pur@@ pose of my life .
I re@@ sol@@ ved to give back .
"L@@ ater , I jo@@ ined the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank , which s@@ ou@@ ght to fi@@ ght such pover@@ ty by trans@@ fer@@ r@@ ing a@@ id from ri@@ ch to po@@ or countries ."
"My in@@ iti@@ al work foc@@ used on U@@ gan@@ da , where I foc@@ used on ne@@ got@@ i@@ ating re@@ form@@ s with the F@@ in@@ ance M@@ in@@ ist@@ ry of U@@ gan@@ da so they could acc@@ ess our lo@@ ans ."
"But after we dis@@ bur@@ sed the lo@@ ans , I remember a tri@@ p in U@@ gan@@ da where I found ne@@ w@@ ly built scho@@ ols without te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ oks or teach@@ ers , new health cl@@ in@@ ics without dru@@ gs , and the po@@ or once again without any vo@@ ice or re@@ course ."
It was Bi@@ ha@@ r all over again .
Bi@@ ha@@ r re@@ pres@@ ents the chall@@ enge of develop@@ ment : ab@@ ject pover@@ ty sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by cor@@ rup@@ tion .
"G@@ l@@ ob@@ ally , 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people live on less than $ 1@@ .@@ 25 a day , and the work I did in U@@ gan@@ da re@@ pres@@ ents the trad@@ iti@@ onal appro@@ ach to these problems that has been pra@@ cti@@ ced since 19@@ 4@@ 4 , when win@@ n@@ ers of Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I , 500 f@@ oun@@ ding fa@@ thers , and one lon@@ ely f@@ oun@@ ding mother , ga@@ ther@@ ed in New H@@ am@@ p@@ shi@@ re , U@@ S@@ A , to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh the B@@ ret@@ ton W@@ o@@ od@@ s instit@@ utions , inclu@@ ding the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank ."
"And that trad@@ iti@@ onal appro@@ ach to develop@@ ment had three key ele@@ ments . F@@ i@@ rst , trans@@ f@@ er of resour@@ ces from ri@@ ch countries in the Nor@@ th to po@@ ore@@ r countries in the S@@ outh , ac@@ compani@@ ed by re@@ form pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions ."
"Se@@ con@@ d , the develop@@ ment instit@@ utions that chan@@ n@@ el@@ ed these trans@@ f@@ ers were op@@ a@@ qu@@ e , with little tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy of what they finan@@ ced or what resul@@ ts they achi@@ ev@@ ed ."
"And third , the eng@@ ag@@ ement in develop@@ ing countries was with a nar@@ row set of government el@@ it@@ es with little inter@@ action with the c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens , who are the ul@@ tim@@ ate ben@@ ef@@ ici@@ ari@@ es of develop@@ ment as@@ si@@ stance ."
"T@@ oday , each of these ele@@ ments is op@@ ening up du@@ e to dra@@ m@@ atic changes in the global environment ."
"O@@ p@@ en knowled@@ ge , open a@@ id , open govern@@ ance , and together , they re@@ present three key shi@@ f@@ ts that are trans@@ form@@ ing develop@@ ment and that also h@@ old gre@@ ater hope for the problems I w@@ it@@ nes@@ sed in U@@ gan@@ da and in Bi@@ ha@@ r ."
The first key shi@@ ft is open knowled@@ ge .
"You know , develop@@ ing countries today will not simply acc@@ ept sol@@ utions that are han@@ ded down to them by the U.@@ S. , Euro@@ pe or the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank ."
"They get their in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation , their hope , their pra@@ cti@@ cal know@@ -@@ how , from succ@@ ess@@ ful em@@ er@@ ging econo@@ mi@@ es in the S@@ outh ."
"They want to know how China li@@ f@@ ted 500 million people out of pover@@ ty in 30 years , how M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s O@@ por@@ tu@@ ni@@ da@@ des progra@@ m impro@@ ved scho@@ ol@@ ing and nu@@ tr@@ ition for milli@@ ons of children ."
"This is the new ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em of op@@ en@@ -@@ knowled@@ ge flo@@ ws , not just trav@@ el@@ ing Nor@@ th to S@@ outh , but S@@ outh to S@@ outh , and even S@@ outh to Nor@@ th , with M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s O@@ por@@ tu@@ ni@@ da@@ des today in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing New York C@@ ity ."
"And just as these Nor@@ th@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ S@@ outh trans@@ f@@ ers are op@@ ening up , so too are the develop@@ ment instit@@ utions that chan@@ n@@ el@@ ed these trans@@ f@@ ers ."
This is the second shi@@ ft : open a@@ id .
"R@@ ec@@ ently , the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank op@@ en@@ ed its va@@ ul@@ t of data for public use , re@@ le@@ as@@ ing 8@@ ,000 economic and social indi@@ cat@@ ors for 2@@ 00 countries over 50 years , and it lau@@ n@@ ched a global comp@@ et@@ ition to c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ sour@@ ce innov@@ ative app@@ s using this data ."
D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ment instit@@ utions today are also op@@ ening for public sc@@ ru@@ tiny the pro@@ jects they fin@@ ance .
"Ta@@ ke G@@ e@@ o@@ Ma@@ pp@@ ing . In this ma@@ p from K@@ en@@ y@@ a , the red d@@ ots show where all the scho@@ ols finan@@ ced by do@@ nor@@ s are lo@@ c@@ ated , and the dar@@ k@@ er the sha@@ de of gre@@ en , the more the number of out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ school children ."
"So this simple mash@@ up re@@ ve@@ als that do@@ nor@@ s have not finan@@ ced any scho@@ ols in the are@@ as with the most out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ school children , pro@@ vo@@ king new questions . I@@ s develop@@ ment as@@ si@@ stance tar@@ get@@ ing those who most need our help ?"
"In this man@@ ner , the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank has now G@@ e@@ o@@ Ma@@ pped 3@@ 0,000 project activ@@ ities in 1@@ 4@@ 3 countries , and do@@ nor@@ s are using a common plat@@ form to ma@@ p all their pro@@ jects ."
This is a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous lea@@ p for@@ ward in tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy and ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bil@@ ity of a@@ id .
"And this lea@@ ds me to the third , and in my view , the most sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant shi@@ ft in develop@@ ment : open govern@@ ance . G@@ over@@ n@@ ments today are op@@ ening up just as c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens are de@@ man@@ ding vo@@ ice and ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bil@@ ity ."
"F@@ rom the A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing to the An@@ na H@@ az@@ are movement in India , using mobil@@ e ph@@ ones and social medi@@ a not just for polit@@ ical ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bil@@ ity but also for develop@@ ment ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bil@@ ity ."
A@@ re govern@@ ments deli@@ ver@@ ing ser@@ vi@@ ces to the c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens ?
"So for in@@ stance , sever@@ al govern@@ ments in Africa and E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Euro@@ pe are op@@ ening their bud@@ gets to the public ."
"But , you know , there is a big difference between a bud@@ get that &apos;s public and a bud@@ get that &apos;s acc@@ es@@ sible ."
"This is a public bud@@ get . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really acc@@ es@@ sible or under@@ stan@@ d@@ able to an ordin@@ ary c@@ it@@ iz@@ en that is trying to understand how the government is sp@@ en@@ ding its resour@@ ces ."
"To ta@@ ck@@ le this problem , govern@@ ments are using new to@@ ols to vis@@ u@@ aliz@@ e the bud@@ get so it &apos;s more under@@ stan@@ d@@ able to the public ."
"In this ma@@ p from M@@ ol@@ dov@@ a , the gre@@ en col@@ or shows those di@@ stri@@ c@@ ts that have low sp@@ en@@ ding on scho@@ ols but good educ@@ ational out@@ comes , and the red col@@ or shows the op@@ pos@@ ite ."
"T@@ o@@ ols like this help turn a sh@@ el@@ f full of in@@ sc@@ ru@@ table do@@ cu@@ ments into a publi@@ c@@ ly under@@ stan@@ d@@ able vis@@ ual , and what &apos;s exc@@ iting is that with this op@@ en@@ ness , there are today new opport@@ unities for c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens to give fe@@ ed@@ back and eng@@ age with government ."
"So in the P@@ h@@ ili@@ pp@@ ines today , parents and students can give re@@ al@@ -@@ time fe@@ ed@@ back on a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , Ch@@ ec@@ k@@ my@@ scho@@ ol@@ .@@ or@@ g , or using S@@ M@@ S , whether teach@@ ers and te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ oks are sho@@ wing up in school , the same problems I w@@ it@@ nes@@ sed in U@@ gan@@ da and in Bi@@ ha@@ r ."
"And the government is respon@@ sive . So for in@@ stance , when it was re@@ por@@ ted on this we@@ b@@ s@@ ite that 8@@ 00 students were at risk because school re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s had st@@ all@@ ed du@@ e to cor@@ rup@@ tion , the De@@ part@@ ment of E@@ duc@@ ation in the P@@ h@@ ili@@ pp@@ ines took s@@ wi@@ ft action ."
"And you know what &apos;s exc@@ iting is that this innov@@ ation is now s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing S@@ outh to S@@ outh , from the P@@ h@@ ili@@ pp@@ ines to In@@ don@@ es@@ ia , K@@ en@@ y@@ a , M@@ ol@@ dov@@ a and be@@ y@@ ond ."
"In D@@ ar es S@@ al@@ a@@ am , T@@ an@@ z@@ ani@@ a , even an im@@ pover@@ ish@@ ed community was able to use these to@@ ols to vo@@ ice its as@@ pi@@ r@@ ations ."
"This is what the ma@@ p of T@@ an@@ d@@ ale looked like in A@@ u@@ gu@@ st , 20@@ 11 . But within a few we@@ eks , univers@@ ity students were able to use mobil@@ e ph@@ ones and an op@@ en@@ -@@ sour@@ ce plat@@ form to dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally ma@@ p the entire community infra@@ structure ."
"And what is very exc@@ iting is that c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens were then able to give fe@@ ed@@ back as to which health or water poin@@ ts were not working , ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated in the red bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es that you see , which together pro@@ vid@@ es a gra@@ ph@@ ic vis@@ ual of the colle@@ ctive vo@@ ices of the po@@ or ."
"T@@ oday , even Bi@@ ha@@ r is tur@@ ning around and op@@ ening up under a comm@@ it@@ ted lea@@ der@@ ship that is making government tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent , acc@@ es@@ sible and respon@@ sive to the po@@ or ."
"But , you know , in many parts of the world , govern@@ ments are not interest@@ ed in op@@ ening up or in ser@@ ving the po@@ or , and it is a real chall@@ enge for those who want to change the system ."
"Th@@ ese are the lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors like my father and many , many others , and a key fron@@ ti@@ er of develop@@ ment work is to help these lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors jo@@ in hands so they can together over@@ come the od@@ ds ."
"So for in@@ stance , today , in G@@ h@@ ana , cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous re@@ for@@ mer@@ s from ci@@ vil society , Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent and government , have for@@ g@@ ed a co@@ al@@ ition for tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts in the oil sec@@ tor , and , gal@@ v@@ an@@ iz@@ ed by this , re@@ for@@ mer@@ s in Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent are now invest@@ ig@@ ating du@@ bi@@ ous con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts ."
"Th@@ ese exam@@ ples give new hope , new pos@@ sibil@@ ity to the problems I w@@ it@@ nes@@ sed in U@@ gan@@ da or that my father con@@ fron@@ ted in Bi@@ ha@@ r ."
"T@@ w@@ o years ago , on A@@ pri@@ l 8@@ th , 20@@ 10 , I called my father ."
"It was very l@@ ate at night , and at age 80 , he was ty@@ ping a 7@@ 0-@@ p@@ age public inter@@ est l@@ iti@@ g@@ ation against cor@@ rup@@ tion in a ro@@ ad project ."
"Th@@ ough he was no la@@ w@@ y@@ er , he argu@@ ed the case in cour@@ t him@@ self the next day . He won the ru@@ ling , but later that very ev@@ ening , he f@@ ell , and he di@@ ed ."
"He f@@ ou@@ ght t@@ ill the end , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly pas@@ sion@@ ate that to com@@ b@@ at cor@@ rup@@ tion and pover@@ ty , not only did government off@@ ici@@ als need to be h@@ on@@ est , but c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens needed to jo@@ in together to make their vo@@ ices heard ."
"Th@@ ese became the two bo@@ ok@@ ends of his life , and the jour@@ ney he trav@@ el@@ ed in between mir@@ ro@@ red the chang@@ ing develop@@ ment lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape ."
"T@@ oday , I &apos;m in@@ spi@@ red by these changes , and I &apos;m exc@@ ited that at the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank , we are em@@ bra@@ cing these new direc@@ tions , a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant de@@ par@@ ture from my work in U@@ gan@@ da 20 years ago ."
"We need to radi@@ cally open up develop@@ ment so knowled@@ ge flo@@ ws in mul@@ ti@@ ple direc@@ tions , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing pra@@ c@@ t@@ iti@@ on@@ ers , so a@@ id be@@ comes tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent , ac@@ coun@@ table and effec@@ tive , so govern@@ ments open up and c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens are eng@@ ag@@ ed and em@@ power@@ ed with re@@ for@@ mer@@ s in government ."
We need to acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate these shi@@ f@@ ts .
"If we do , we will find that the colle@@ ctive vo@@ ices of the po@@ or will be heard in Bi@@ ha@@ r , in U@@ gan@@ da , and be@@ y@@ ond ."
We will find that te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ oks and teach@@ ers will show up in scho@@ ols for their children .
"We will find that these children , too , have a real chan@@ ce of bre@@ a@@ king their way out of pover@@ ty ."
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
"So imagine that a plan@@ e is about to c@@ ras@@ h with 2@@ 50 children and bab@@ ies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?"
Now imagine that 60 plan@@ es full of bab@@ ies under five c@@ ras@@ h every single day .
That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
6@@ .@@ 6 million children never make it to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
"Mo@@ st of these de@@ a@@ ths are prev@@ en@@ table , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sa@@ d , it makes me ang@@ ry , and it makes me det@@ er@@ min@@ ed ."
"D@@ i@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a and p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia are am@@ ong the top two kill@@ ers of children under five , and what we can do to prev@@ ent these dise@@ ases isn &apos;t some sm@@ art , new technolo@@ g@@ ical innov@@ ations ."
It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s ol@@ d@@ est inv@@ enti@@ ons : a b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p .
"W@@ ash@@ ing hands with so@@ a@@ p , a h@@ ab@@ it we all take for gran@@ ted , can re@@ du@@ ce di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a by half , can re@@ du@@ ce re@@ spi@@ rat@@ ory inf@@ ec@@ tions by one third ."
"H@@ an@@ d@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p can have an imp@@ act on re@@ duc@@ ing fl@@ u , tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a , S@@ A@@ R@@ S , and most rec@@ ently in the case of ch@@ ol@@ era and E@@ bol@@ a out@@ bre@@ ak , one of the key inter@@ v@@ enti@@ ons is han@@ d@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ."
H@@ an@@ d@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ke@@ ep@@ s kids in school .
It sto@@ ps bab@@ ies from d@@ ying .
H@@ an@@ d@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p is one of the most co@@ st@@ -@@ effec@@ tive ways of sav@@ ing children &apos;s lives .
"It can s@@ ave over 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 children every year ."
That &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of sto@@ pp@@ ing 10 ju@@ m@@ bo j@@ ets full of bab@@ ies and children from cra@@ sh@@ ing every single day .
I think you &apos;ll ag@@ ree with me that that &apos;s a pretty u@@ se@@ ful public health inter@@ ven@@ tion .
So now just take a minut@@ e .
I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
Why don &apos;t you just sha@@ ke their hands .
P@@ le@@ ase sha@@ ke their hands .
"A@@ ll right , get to know each other ."
They look really pretty .
All right .
"So what if I told you that the person wh@@ ose hands you just sho@@ ok actually didn &apos;t w@@ ash their hands when they were coming out of the to@@ il@@ et ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty any@@ more , right ?"
"P@@ ret@@ ty y@@ u@@ ck@@ y , you would ag@@ ree with me ."
"Well , stati@@ st@@ ics are actually sho@@ wing that four people out of five don &apos;t w@@ ash their hands when they come out of the to@@ il@@ et , glob@@ ally ."
"And the same way , we don &apos;t do it when we &apos;ve got f@@ an@@ cy to@@ il@@ ets , ru@@ n@@ ning water , and so@@ a@@ p av@@ ail@@ able , it &apos;s the same thing in the countries where child mor@@ tal@@ ity is really high ."
What is it ? I@@ s there no so@@ a@@ p ?
"A@@ c@@ tually , so@@ a@@ p is av@@ ail@@ able ."
"In 9@@ 0 percent of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in India , 9@@ 4 percent of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , you will find so@@ a@@ p ."
"E@@ ven in countries where so@@ a@@ p is the lo@@ w@@ est , like E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia , we are at 50 percent ."
So why is it ?
Why are@@ n &apos;t people wa@@ sh@@ ing their hands ?
"Wh@@ y is it that Ma@@ y@@ ank , this young bo@@ y that I met in India , isn &apos;t wa@@ sh@@ ing his hands ?"
"Well , in Ma@@ y@@ ank &apos;s family , so@@ a@@ p is used for ba@@ thing , so@@ a@@ p is used for lau@@ n@@ d@@ ry , so@@ a@@ p is used for wa@@ sh@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es ."
"H@@ is parents think sometimes it &apos;s a pre@@ ci@@ ous com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cu@@ p@@ bo@@ ard ."
They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t w@@ ast@@ e it .
"On aver@@ age , in Ma@@ y@@ ank &apos;s family , they will use so@@ a@@ p for wa@@ sh@@ ing hands once a day at the very best , and sometimes even once a week for wa@@ sh@@ ing hands with so@@ a@@ p ."
What &apos;s the resul@@ t of that ?
"Ch@@ il@@ dren pic@@ k up disease in the place that &apos;s sup@@ posed to love them and prote@@ ct them the most , in their hom@@ es ."
Th@@ in@@ k about where you learned to w@@ ash your hands .
D@@ id you learn to w@@ ash your hands at home ?
D@@ id you learn to w@@ ash your hands in school ?
I think behavi@@ or@@ al scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the h@@ ab@@ its that you have had early in life .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , we all c@@ op@@ y what everyone else does , and local cul@@ tu@@ ral nor@@ ms are something that sh@@ ape how we change our behavi@@ or , and this is where the priv@@ ate sec@@ tor comes in ."
"E@@ very second in A@@ si@@ a and Africa , 1@@ 11 mo@@ thers will bu@@ y this b@@ ar to prote@@ ct their family ."
"M@@ any women in India will tell you they learned all about hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , dise@@ ases , from this b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p from Li@@ fe@@ bu@@ o@@ y br@@ and ."
I@@ con@@ ic b@@ ran@@ ds like this one have a respon@@ sibil@@ ity to do good in the places where they s@@ ell their produc@@ ts .
"It &apos;s that beli@@ e@@ f , pl@@ us the scale of U@@ n@@ il@@ ever , that allo@@ ws us to keep talking about han@@ d@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p and hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e to these mo@@ thers ."
Bi@@ g busin@@ ess@@ es and b@@ ran@@ ds can change and shi@@ ft those social nor@@ ms and make a difference for those h@@ ab@@ its that are so stu@@ b@@ born .
Th@@ in@@ k about it : Mar@@ k@@ et@@ e@@ ers spend all their time making us sw@@ it@@ ch from one br@@ and to the other .
"And actually , they know how to trans@@ form science and fac@@ ts into comp@@ ell@@ ing mes@@ sa@@ ges ."
"@@ Ju@@ st for a minut@@ e , imagine when they put all their for@@ ces behind a mes@@ sage as powerful as han@@ d@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ."
The prof@@ it mot@@ i@@ ve is trans@@ form@@ ing health out@@ comes in this world .

"L@@ ast week , I was in G@@ h@@ ana with the min@@ ist@@ er of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a ch@@ ol@@ era out@@ bre@@ ak in G@@ h@@ ana at the moment ."
"A hun@@ d@@ red and ei@@ gh@@ te@@ en years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about en@@ sur@@ ing that they have acc@@ ess to this b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop ch@@ ol@@ era from s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing ."
"I think this dri@@ ve for prof@@ it is ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most comm@@ it@@ ted ch@@ ar@@ ity or government ."

"W@@ i@@ th@@ out it , and without talking about it , we can@@ not achi@@ eve the change that we need ."
"L@@ ast week , my team and I sp@@ ent time vis@@ iting mo@@ thers that have all experi@@ en@@ ced the same thing : the de@@ ath of a ne@@ w@@ born ."
I &apos;m a mom . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more pain@@ ful .
This one is from M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r .
"S@@ he had the most beautiful sm@@ ile , the sm@@ ile , I think , that life gi@@ ves you when you &apos;ve had a second chan@@ ce ."
"H@@ er son , M@@ y@@ o , is her second one ."
"S@@ he had a d@@ aughter who pas@@ sed away at three we@@ eks , and we know that the maj@@ or@@ ity of children that actually die die in the first mon@@ th of their life , and we know that if we give a b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p to every sk@@ ill@@ ed bir@@ th atten@@ d@@ ant , and that if so@@ a@@ p is used before tou@@ ching the bab@@ ies , we can re@@ du@@ ce and make a change in terms of those num@@ bers ."
"And that &apos;s what in@@ spi@@ res me , in@@ spi@@ res me to contin@@ ue in this mis@@ sion , to know that I can equ@@ i@@ p her with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing her ne@@ w@@ born ."
"And next time you think of a gi@@ ft for a new mom and her family , don &apos;t look far : bu@@ y her so@@ a@@ p ."
It &apos;s the most beautiful inv@@ en@@ tion in public health .

"Th@@ ese are simple ob@@ jects : clo@@ cks , ke@@ ys , com@@ b@@ s , glas@@ ses ."
They are the things the vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s of gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de in B@@ os@@ ni@@ a car@@ ri@@ ed with them on their fin@@ al jour@@ ney .
"We are all famili@@ ar with these m@@ un@@ dan@@ e , every@@ day ob@@ jects ."
"U@@ su@@ ally , they were told that they were going to be ex@@ changed for pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers of war ."
"Th@@ ese it@@ ems have been rec@@ over@@ ed from nu@@ mer@@ ous mas@@ s g@@ rav@@ es across my hom@@ el@@ and , and as we speak , for@@ en@@ si@@ cs are ex@@ hum@@ ing bod@@ ies from ne@@ w@@ ly discover@@ ed mas@@ s g@@ rav@@ es , 20 years after the war ."
And it is quite pos@@ si@@ bly the lar@@ g@@ est ever discover@@ ed .
"D@@ uring the four years of conf@@ li@@ ct that de@@ va@@ st@@ ated the B@@ os@@ ni@@ an n@@ ation in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s , appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately 3@@ 0,000 c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens , ma@@ in@@ ly ci@@ v@@ ili@@ ans , went mis@@ sing , pre@@ sum@@ ed kill@@ ed , and another 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 were kill@@ ed during com@@ b@@ at oper@@ ations ."
"Mo@@ st of them were kill@@ ed ei@@ ther in the early days of the war or to@@ wards the end of the ho@@ st@@ il@@ ities , when U.@@ N@@ . sa@@ fe z@@ ones like S@@ re@@ br@@ eni@@ ca f@@ ell into the hands of the S@@ er@@ b ar@@ my ."
The inter@@ national cri@@ min@@ al tri@@ bu@@ nal deli@@ ver@@ ed a number of sent@@ ences for cri@@ m@@ es against hum@@ an@@ ity and gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de .
"G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is a syst@@ em@@ atic and deli@@ ber@@ ate dest@@ ru@@ ction of a ra@@ cial , polit@@ ical , religi@@ ous or e@@ th@@ ni@@ c group ."
A@@ s much as gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de is about kill@@ ing .
"It is also about dest@@ ro@@ ying their pro@@ per@@ ty , their cul@@ tu@@ ral her@@ it@@ age , and ul@@ tim@@ ately the very not@@ ion that they ever exist@@ ed ."
G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is not only about the kill@@ ing ; it is about the d@@ eni@@ ed id@@ ent@@ ity .
There are always tra@@ ces — no such thing as a perf@@ ect cri@@ me .
There are always rem@@ nan@@ ts of the per@@ ish@@ ed ones that are more du@@ ra@@ ble than their fra@@ g@@ ile bod@@ ies and our sel@@ ec@@ tive and f@@ ad@@ ing mem@@ ory of them .

Thank you very much .
( Applause )
But that can &apos;t be right .
I am for cho@@ col@@ ate don@@ ut@@ s .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0-@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es .
This was part of a chall@@ enge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that adv@@ ent@@ u@@ rou@@ s before I started my 3@@ 0-@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es .
It &apos;s aw@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fu@@ n ."
( Applause )
"H@@ i . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in progres@@ s ."
"S@@ in@@ ce we are still realiz@@ ing these works , we are lar@@ g@@ ely working within the re@@ al@@ m of in@@ tu@@ ition and my@@ st@@ ery , still ."
So I &apos;m going to try and descri@@ be some of the experi@@ ences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
So the first work is called the I@@ m@@ peri@@ al M@@ ono@@ ch@@ rom@@ es .
"A vi@@ e@@ wer sort of un@@ su@@ spe@@ c@@ tin@@ g@@ ly wal@@ ks into the room , and cat@@ ch@@ es a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of these pan@@ els in a mes@@ sy com@@ pos@@ ition on the w@@ all ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in secon@@ ds , as if the pan@@ els have not@@ ic@@ ed the pres@@ ence of the vi@@ e@@ wer , they appe@@ ar to p@@ ani@@ c and sort of get into a stri@@ ct sym@@ met@@ ry ."
( Laughter ) So this is the sk@@ et@@ ch of the two stat@@ es .
One is tot@@ al cha@@ os . The other is absol@@ ute order .
And we were interest@@ ed in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
This also rem@@ in@@ ded us of two very different pic@@ t@@ ori@@ al trad@@ itions .
"One is the al@@ ta@@ r ta@@ bl@@ ets of the 1@@ 5@@ th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , M@@ al@@ e@@ vi@@ ch &apos;s ab@@ stra@@ ct com@@ pos@@ itions ."
So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
"To give you a sense of scale , the lar@@ g@@ est pan@@ el is about two met@@ ers high ."
That &apos;s about this much . And the sm@@ all@@ est one is an A@@ 4 .
"So a vi@@ e@@ wer en@@ ters the space , and they s@@ na@@ p to atten@@ tion ."
"And after a while , if the vi@@ e@@ wer contin@@ ues to re@@ ma@@ in in the space , the pan@@ els will sort of become im@@ mu@@ ne to the pres@@ ence of the vi@@ e@@ wer and become la@@ x and au@@ to@@ no@@ m@@ ous again , until they sort of sense a pres@@ ence in the room or a movement , when they will again s@@ na@@ p to atten@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) So here it appe@@ ar@@ s as if it &apos;s the vi@@ e@@ wer that &apos;s sort of inst@@ ig@@ ating the sense of order am@@ ong the pan@@ els , but it could also be the other way around , that the pan@@ els are so stu@@ ck within their pre@@ cond@@ iti@@ on@@ ed behavi@@ ors that they sort of th@@ ru@@ st the vi@@ e@@ wer with the ro@@ le of a ty@@ ran@@ t ."
"So this br@@ ings me to a qui@@ et@@ er , small work called H@@ an@@ d@@ hel@@ d ."
"The vi@@ e@@ wer se@@ es a piece of pa@@ per that &apos;s m@@ oun@@ ted on the far end of the w@@ all , but when you go clo@@ s@@ er , you see that it &apos;s a bl@@ ank A@@ 4 , or a let@@ ter@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed piece of pa@@ per , that &apos;s hel@@ d on ei@@ ther side by two small hands that appe@@ ar to be car@@ ved with a great de@@ al of atten@@ tion and care from a small blo@@ ck of wo@@ od ."
"The vi@@ e@@ wer also se@@ es that this entire s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture is sort of moving very sli@@ gh@@ tly , as if these two hands are trying to h@@ old the pa@@ per very still for a long period of time , and some@@ how are not manag@@ ing to ."
So this inst@@ ability in the movement very clo@@ sel@@ y re@@ sem@@ bl@@ es the un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y nature of images seen through a han@@ d@@ hel@@ d cam@@ era .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two tan@@ d@@ em c@@ li@@ ps .
One is through a still cam@@ era and the other is through a han@@ d@@ hel@@ d cam@@ era .
And you im@@ medi@@ ately see how the un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y nature of the video su@@ gg@@ est@@ s the pres@@ ence of an ob@@ ser@@ ver and a sub@@ jec@@ tive point of view .
So we &apos;ve just re@@ mo@@ ved the cam@@ era and trans@@ fer@@ red that movement on@@ to the pan@@ el .
So here &apos;s a video .
You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
"But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to e@@ vo@@ ke a self-@@ eff@@ ac@@ ing g@@ est@@ ure , as if there &apos;s a little person with out@@ stre@@ t@@ ched ar@@ ms behind this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous piece of pa@@ per ."
That sort of lik@@ ens it to the amount of stra@@ in to be at the ser@@ vice of the ob@@ ser@@ ver and present this piece of pa@@ per very del@@ ic@@ ately to the vi@@ e@@ wer in front of them .
The next work is D@@ ec@@ o@@ y .
"This is a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard model , so the ob@@ ject is about as t@@ all as I am ."
"It has a ro@@ un@@ ded body , two ar@@ ms , and a very t@@ all , he@@ ad@@ -@@ like an@@ ten@@ na , and its sol@@ e pur@@ pose is to at@@ tra@@ ct atten@@ tion to@@ wards itself ."
"So when a vi@@ e@@ wer pas@@ ses by , it sort of t@@ il@@ ts from side to side , and mo@@ ves its ar@@ ms more and more f@@ ran@@ ti@@ cally as the person gets clo@@ s@@ er ."
So here is the first test sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
"You see the two move@@ ments in@@ te@@ g@@ rat@@ ed , and the ob@@ ject se@@ ems to be em@@ plo@@ ying its entire being in this ex@@ pres@@ sion of des@@ per@@ ation ."
"But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s atten@@ tion , it &apos;s no longer interest@@ ed , and it looks for the next person wh@@ ose atten@@ tion to get ."
( Laughter ) So this is the fin@@ al f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ated body of the D@@ ec@@ o@@ y .
It appe@@ ar@@ s to be mas@@ s@@ -@@ man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ red like it came out of a fac@@ tory like v@@ ac@@ u@@ um cle@@ an@@ ers and wa@@ sh@@ ing mach@@ ines .
"Because we are always working from a very pers@@ onal space , we like how this con@@ su@@ mer a@@ es@@ th@@ et@@ ic sort of de@@ person@@ aliz@@ es the ob@@ ject and gi@@ ves us a bit of di@@ stance in its appe@@ ar@@ ance , at least ."
"And so to us this is a kind of sin@@ ist@@ er being which is trying to di@@ stra@@ ct you from the things that actually need your atten@@ tion , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help ."
"The next work is an ob@@ ject , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instru@@ ment ."
In the sh@@ ape of an am@@ ph@@ i@@ the@@ ater that &apos;s sc@@ al@@ ed to the size of an audi@@ ence as perc@@ ei@@ ved from somebody from the stage .
"So from where I &apos;m standing , each of you appe@@ ar@@ s to be this big , and the audi@@ ence sort of takes the entire fiel@@ d of my vision ."
Se@@ ated in this audi@@ ence are 9@@ 9@@ 6 small fi@@ gu@@ res .
They &apos;re me@@ chan@@ ically en@@ ab@@ led to c@@ la@@ p of their own free will .
"This means that each of them can deci@@ de if and when they want to c@@ la@@ p , how hard , for how long , how they want to be inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ced by those around them or inf@@ lu@@ ence others , and if they want to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to innov@@ ation ."
"So when the vi@@ e@@ wer step@@ s in front of the audi@@ ence , there will be a respon@@ se ."
"It could be a few c@@ la@@ ps or a stron@@ g ap@@ plause , and then nothing happens until the vi@@ e@@ wer le@@ av@@ es the stage , and again the audi@@ ence will res@@ po@@ nd ."
"It could be anything from a few fe@@ e@@ ble c@@ la@@ ps from mem@@ bers in the audi@@ ence , or it could be a very l@@ ou@@ d ov@@ ation ."
"So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audi@@ ence as its own ob@@ ject or its own organ@@ ism that &apos;s also got a sort of mu@@ si@@ cal@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it , an instru@@ ment ."
"So the vi@@ e@@ wer can play it by el@@ ic@@ iting quite complex and vari@@ ed , nu@@ an@@ ced mu@@ si@@ cal or sound patter@@ ns , but can@@ not really pro@@ vo@@ ke the audi@@ ence into any particular kind of respon@@ se ."
So there &apos;s a sense of ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment and ca@@ pri@@ ci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess and u@@ ne@@ as@@ in@@ ess invol@@ ved .
It also has an all@@ uring and tra@@ p@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it .
So here if you see we &apos;re quite exc@@ ited about the image of the head s@@ pl@@ it@@ ting to form the two hands .
"So here &apos;s a small vis@@ ual anim@@ ation , as if the two sid@@ es of the brain are sort of c@@ la@@ sh@@ ing against each other to kind of make sense of the du@@ ality and the ten@@ sion ."
And here is a pro@@ tot@@ y@@ pe .
So we can &apos;t wa@@ it to be eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed by 9@@ 9@@ 6 of them .
"O@@ kay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the F@@ ra@@ mer@@ un@@ n@@ ers ."
It comes out of the idea of a win@@ do@@ w .
"This is an ac@@ tual win@@ do@@ w in our studi@@ o , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different th@@ ick@@ nes@@ ses of wo@@ od@@ en se@@ ctions ."
So we used the same win@@ do@@ w vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary to con@@ stru@@ ct our own fra@@ me or gri@@ d that &apos;s su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded in the room and that can be vi@@ e@@ wed from two sid@@ es .
This gri@@ d is in@@ h@@ ab@@ ited by a tri@@ be of small fi@@ gu@@ res .
"They &apos;re also made up of three different si@@ z@@ es , as if to su@@ gg@@ est a kind of perspe@@ ctive or lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape on the single pla@@ in ."
E@@ ach of these fi@@ gu@@ res can also run back@@ ward and for@@ ward in the tra@@ ck and hi@@ de behind two ad@@ ja@@ c@@ ent tra@@ cks .
"So in con@@ tra@@ st to this very ti@@ ght gri@@ d , we wanted to give these fi@@ gu@@ res a very com@@ ical and s@@ la@@ p@@ st@@ ick@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality , as if a pu@@ pp@@ et@@ e@@ er has taken them and physi@@ cally anim@@ ated them down the pat@@ h ."
"So we like the idea of these fi@@ gu@@ res sort of s@@ ki@@ pp@@ ing along like they &apos;re ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and care@@ free and happ@@ y-@@ go@@ -@@ lu@@ ck@@ y and con@@ t@@ ent , until they sort of sense a movement from the vi@@ e@@ wer and they will hi@@ de behind the f@@ ast@@ est w@@ all ."
"So to us , this work also pres@@ ents its own con@@ tra@@ di@@ ction ."
"Th@@ ese fi@@ gu@@ res are sort of ent@@ ra@@ pped within this very stron@@ g gri@@ d , which is like a pri@@ son , but also a for@@ tre@@ s@@ s , because it allo@@ ws them to be ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and nai@@ ve and care@@ free and quite ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of the ex@@ ter@@ nal world ."
"So all these real life qu@@ al@@ ities that I talk about are sort of tran@@ sl@@ ated to a very speci@@ fic tech@@ ni@@ cal con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation , and we were very lu@@ ck@@ y to col@@ labor@@ ate with E@@ T@@ H Z@@ u@@ ri@@ ch to devel@@ op the first pro@@ tot@@ y@@ pe ."
So you see they extra@@ cted the mot@@ ion c@@ og@@ s from our anim@@ ations and created a w@@ ig@@ g@@ le that in@@ te@@ g@@ rat@@ ed the he@@ ad@@ -@@ b@@ ob@@ b@@ ing movement and the back@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ for@@ th movement .
So it &apos;s really quite small .
You can see it can f@@ it into the pal@@ m of my hand .
"So imagine our exc@@ it@@ ement when we saw it really working in the studi@@ o , and here it is ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
"So in colle@@ ge , I was a government maj@@ or , which means I had to write a lot of pa@@ per@@ s ."
"Now , when a norm@@ al stud@@ ent writ@@ es a pa@@ per , they might s@@ pre@@ ad the work out a little like this ."
"So , you know — ( Laughter ) you get started maybe a little slo@@ w@@ ly , but you get enough done in the first week that , with some he@@ av@@ i@@ er days later on , everything gets done , things st@@ ay ci@@ vil . ( Laughter )"
And I would want to do that like that .
That would be the plan .
"I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the pa@@ per would come along , and then I would kind of do this ."
( Laughter ) And that would happen every single pa@@ per .
"But then came my 9@@ 0-@@ p@@ age s@@ eni@@ or th@@ es@@ is , a pa@@ per you &apos;re sup@@ posed to spend a year on ."
"And I knew for a pa@@ per like that , my norm@@ al work f@@ low was not an op@@ tion ."
It was way too big a project .
"So I plan@@ ned things out , and I decided I kind of had to go something like this ."
This is how the year would go .
"So I &apos;d start off light , and I &apos;d bu@@ m@@ p it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would k@@ ick it up into high ge@@ ar just like a little sta@@ ir@@ case ."
How hard could it be to walk up the sta@@ ir@@ s ?
"No big de@@ al , right ?"
"But then , the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened ."
Th@@ ose first few months ?
"They came and went , and I couldn &apos;t quite do stuff ."
So we had an aw@@ es@@ ome new re@@ vis@@ ed plan .
"And then two months turned into one mon@@ th , which turned into two we@@ eks ."
I thought that was the end of everything .
"But a week later I get a call , and it &apos;s the school ."
"And they say , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this T@@ im U@@ r@@ b@@ an ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; We need to talk about your th@@ es@@ is . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; It &apos;s the best one we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;"
"It was a very , very bad th@@ es@@ is . ( Laughter )"
"I just wanted to en@@ jo@@ y that one moment when all of you thought , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )"
"No , no , it was very , very bad ."
"A@@ ny@@ way , today I &apos;m a writ@@ er@@ -@@ blo@@ g@@ ger guy ."
I write the blo@@ g W@@ a@@ it But Why .
"And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ation ."
"My behavi@@ or has always per@@ pl@@ ex@@ ed the no@@ n-@@ proc@@ rast@@ in@@ at@@ ors around me , and I wanted to expla@@ in to the no@@ n-@@ proc@@ rast@@ in@@ at@@ ors of the world what goes on in the he@@ ads of proc@@ rast@@ in@@ at@@ ors , and why we are the way we are ."
"Now , I had a hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is that the bra@@ ins of proc@@ rast@@ in@@ at@@ ors were actually different than the bra@@ ins of other people ."
"And to test this , I found an M@@ R@@ I la@@ b that actually let me s@@ can both my brain and the brain of a pro@@ ven no@@ n-@@ proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ator , so I could comp@@ are them ."
I actually b@@ rou@@ ght them here to show you today .
"I know that if you &apos;re not a tra@@ ined brain ex@@ per@@ t , it &apos;s not that obvi@@ ous , but just take a look , OK ?"
( Laughter ) Now ...
here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) There is a difference .
"B@@ ot@@ h bra@@ ins have a R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er in them , but the proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ator &apos;s brain also has an In@@ st@@ ant G@@ r@@ ati@@ fic@@ ation M@@ on@@ key ."
"Now , what does this mean for the proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ator ?"
"Well , it means everything &apos;s f@@ ine until this happens ."
"@@ &#91; This is a perf@@ ect time to get some work done . &#93; &#91; N@@ op@@ e ! &#93; So the R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er will make the r@@ ational deci@@ sion to do something produc@@ tive , but the M@@ on@@ key doesn &apos;t like that plan , so he actually takes the whe@@ el , and he says , &quot; &quot; A@@ c@@ tually , let &apos;s read the entire W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ age of the N@@ an@@ cy K@@ er@@ ri@@ g@@ an / T@@ on@@ y@@ a H@@ ar@@ ding sc@@ an@@ d@@ al , because I just rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed that that happened ."
"( Laughter ) Th@@ en — ( Laughter ) Th@@ en we &apos;re going to go over to the fri@@ d@@ ge , to see if there &apos;s anything new in there since 10 minutes ago ."
"A@@ f@@ ter that , we &apos;re going to go on a Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be spi@@ ral that star@@ ts with vide@@ os of R@@ ich@@ ard F@@ e@@ y@@ n@@ man talking about mag@@ n@@ ets and ends much , much later with us wat@@ ching inter@@ vi@@ e@@ ws with Ju@@ st@@ in Bi@@ e@@ ber &apos;s mom ."
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; All of that &apos;s going to take a while , so we &apos;re not going to really have room on the sch@@ e@@ du@@ le for any work today ."
"S@@ or@@ ry ! &quot; &quot; ( S@@ igh ) Now , what is going on here ?"
The In@@ st@@ ant G@@ r@@ ati@@ fic@@ ation M@@ on@@ key does not se@@ em like a guy you want behind the whe@@ el .
He lives enti@@ rely in the present moment .
"He has no mem@@ ory of the past , no knowled@@ ge of the future , and he only care@@ s about two things : easy and fu@@ n ."
"Now , in the anim@@ al world , that works f@@ ine ."
"If you &apos;re a do@@ g and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fu@@ n things , you &apos;re a huge succ@@ ess !"
"( Laughter ) And to the M@@ on@@ key , humans are just another anim@@ al species ."
"You have to keep w@@ ell@@ -@@ sle@@ pt , w@@ ell@@ -@@ f@@ ed and pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ating into the next gener@@ ation , which in tri@@ b@@ al times might have worked OK ."
"But , if you hav@@ en &apos;t not@@ ic@@ ed , now we &apos;re not in tri@@ b@@ al times ."
"We &apos;re in an adv@@ an@@ ced ci@@ viliz@@ ation , and the M@@ on@@ key does not know what that is ."
"Wh@@ ich is why we have another guy in our brain , the R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er , who gi@@ ves us the ability to do things no other anim@@ al can do ."
We can vis@@ u@@ aliz@@ e the future .
We can see the big picture .
We can make lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m plan@@ s .
And he wan@@ ts to take all of that into ac@@ coun@@ t .
And he wan@@ ts to just have us do what@@ ever makes sense to be doing right now .
"Now , sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fu@@ n , like when you &apos;re having din@@ ner or going to bed or en@@ jo@@ ying w@@ ell@@ -@@ ear@@ ned le@@ is@@ ure time ."
That &apos;s why there &apos;s an over@@ la@@ p .
S@@ omet@@ imes they ag@@ ree .
"But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are har@@ der and less pl@@ eas@@ ant , for the sa@@ ke of the big picture ."
And that &apos;s when we have a conf@@ li@@ ct .
"And for the proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ator , that conf@@ li@@ ct ten@@ ds to end a certain way every time , le@@ av@@ ing him sp@@ en@@ ding a lot of time in this or@@ an@@ ge z@@ one , an easy and fu@@ n place that &apos;s enti@@ rely out of the M@@ ak@@ es S@@ en@@ se cir@@ cle ."
I call it the D@@ ar@@ k P@@ la@@ y@@ ground .
"( Laughter ) Now , the D@@ ar@@ k P@@ la@@ y@@ ground is a place that all of you proc@@ rast@@ in@@ at@@ ors out there know very well ."
It &apos;s where le@@ is@@ ure activ@@ ities happen at times when le@@ is@@ ure activ@@ ities are not sup@@ posed to be happening .
"The fu@@ n you have in the D@@ ar@@ k P@@ la@@ y@@ ground isn &apos;t actually fu@@ n , because it &apos;s completely u@@ ne@@ ar@@ ned , and the air is f@@ ill@@ ed with gu@@ il@@ t , dre@@ ad , an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , self-@@ h@@ at@@ red — all of those good proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ator feel@@ ings ."
"And the question is , in this situ@@ ation , with the M@@ on@@ key behind the whe@@ el , how does the proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ator ever get him@@ self over here to this bl@@ ue z@@ one , a less pl@@ eas@@ ant place , but where really important things happen ?"
"And import@@ an@@ tly , he &apos;s the only thing the M@@ on@@ key is ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed of ."
"( Laughter ) Now , of course , I said yes ."
It &apos;s always been a dre@@ am of m@@ ine to have done a TED T@@ al@@ k in the past .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the middle of all this exc@@ it@@ ement , the R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er se@@ em@@ ed to have something else on his mind ."
"He was saying , &quot; &quot; A@@ re we clear on what we just acc@@ ep@@ ted ?"
Do we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
"As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to re@@ le@@ ase the spe@@ ak@@ ers ."
"And I op@@ en@@ ed up the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , and there was my face star@@ ing right back at me ."
"( Laughter ) So the P@@ ani@@ c M@@ on@@ ster star@@ ts lo@@ sing his mind , and a few secon@@ ds later , the whole system &apos;s in ma@@ y@@ h@@ em . ( Laughter )"
"And the M@@ on@@ key — remember , he &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed of the P@@ ani@@ c M@@ on@@ ster — bo@@ om , he &apos;s up the tre@@ e !"
"And finally , finally , the R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er can take the whe@@ el and I can start working on the talk ."
"Now , the P@@ ani@@ c M@@ on@@ ster expla@@ ins all kinds of pretty in@@ san@@ e proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ator behavi@@ or , like how someone like me could spend two we@@ eks u@@ na@@ ble to start the op@@ ening sent@@ ence of a pa@@ per , and then mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ously find the un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able work e@@ th@@ ic to st@@ ay up all night and write e@@ ight p@@ ages ."
"And this entire situ@@ ation , with the three charac@@ ters — this is the proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ator &apos;s system ."
"It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works ."
This is what I decided to write about on the blo@@ g a couple of years ago .
"When I did , I was amaz@@ ed by the respon@@ se ."
"L@@ it@@ er@@ ally thousands of em@@ ail@@ s came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things ."
"Th@@ ese are people who were n@@ ur@@ ses , ban@@ k@@ ers , pa@@ inter@@ s , engine@@ ers and lots and lots of P@@ h@@ D students ."
"( Laughter ) And they were all writ@@ ing , saying the same thing : &quot; I have this problem too . &quot;"
But what stru@@ ck me was the con@@ tra@@ st between the light t@@ one of the pos@@ t and the he@@ av@@ in@@ ess of these em@@ ail@@ s .
"Th@@ ese people were writ@@ ing with in@@ ten@@ se f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation about what proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ation had done to their lives , about what this M@@ on@@ key had done to them ."
"And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ator &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?"
Why are all of these people in such a dar@@ k place ?
"Well , it turns out that there &apos;s two kinds of proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ation ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about today , the exam@@ ples I &apos;ve given , they all have de@@ a@@ dl@@ ines ."
But there &apos;s a second kind of proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ation that happens in situ@@ ations when there is no de@@ a@@ dl@@ ine .
"So if you wanted a care@@ er where you &apos;re a self-@@ star@@ ter — something in the ar@@ ts , something ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ u@@ ri@@ al — there &apos;s no de@@ a@@ dl@@ ines on those things at first , because nothing &apos;s happening , not until you &apos;ve gone out and done the hard work to get momen@@ tu@@ m , get things going ."
"There &apos;s also all kinds of important things outside of your care@@ er that don &apos;t invol@@ ve any de@@ a@@ dl@@ ines , like seeing your family or ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ ing and taking care of your health , working on your relation@@ ship or getting out of a relation@@ ship that isn &apos;t working ."
"Now if the proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ator &apos;s only me@@ chan@@ ism of doing these hard things is the P@@ ani@@ c M@@ on@@ ster , that &apos;s a problem , because in all of these no@@ n-@@ de@@ a@@ dl@@ ine situ@@ ations , the P@@ ani@@ c M@@ on@@ ster doesn &apos;t show up ."
"He has nothing to wa@@ ke up for , so the effec@@ ts of proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ation , they &apos;re not con@@ ta@@ ined ; they just ex@@ t@@ end ou@@ tw@@ ard fore@@ ver ."
"And it &apos;s this lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m kind of proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ation that &apos;s much less vi@@ sible and much less tal@@ ked about than the fun@@ ni@@ er , shor@@ t-@@ ter@@ m de@@ a@@ dl@@ in@@ e-@@ based kind ."
It &apos;s u@@ su@@ ally su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed qui@@ et@@ ly and priv@@ ately .
"And it can be the sour@@ ce of a huge amount of lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m un@@ happ@@ in@@ ess , and re@@ gre@@ ts ."
"And I thought , that &apos;s why those people are em@@ ail@@ ing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place ."
It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cra@@ m@@ ming for some project .
"It &apos;s that lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ation has made them feel like a spe@@ c@@ tat@@ or , at times , in their own lives ."
The f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation is not that they couldn &apos;t achi@@ eve their dre@@ am@@ s ; it &apos;s that they wer@@ en &apos;t even able to start chas@@ ing them .
So I read these em@@ ail@@ s and I had a little bit of an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any — that I don &apos;t think no@@ n-@@ proc@@ rast@@ in@@ at@@ ors ex@@ ist .
That &apos;s right — I think all of you are proc@@ rast@@ in@@ at@@ ors .
"Now , you might not all be a m@@ ess , like some of us , ( Laughter ) and some of you may have a heal@@ thy relation@@ ship with de@@ a@@ dl@@ ines , but remember : the M@@ on@@ key &apos;s s@@ ne@@ a@@ ki@@ est tri@@ ck is when the de@@ a@@ dl@@ ines are@@ n &apos;t there ."
"Now , I want to show you one last thing ."
I call this a Li@@ fe C@@ al@@ en@@ da@@ r .
That &apos;s one bo@@ x for every week of a 9@@ 0-@@ year life .
"That &apos;s not that many bo@@ x@@ es , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally since we &apos;ve already used a bu@@ n@@ ch of those ."
"So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that cal@@ en@@ da@@ r ."
"We need to think about what we &apos;re really proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ating on , because everyone is proc@@ rast@@ in@@ ating on something in life ."
We need to st@@ ay aw@@ are of the In@@ st@@ ant G@@ r@@ ati@@ fic@@ ation M@@ on@@ key .
That &apos;s a job for all of us .
"And because there &apos;s not that many bo@@ x@@ es on there , it &apos;s a job that should probably start today ."
"Well , maybe not today , but ..@@ ."
( Laughter ) You know .
S@@ omet@@ im@@ e so@@ on .
Thank you .
"There &apos;s a man by the name of C@@ ap@@ tain W@@ illi@@ am S@@ w@@ en@@ son who rec@@ ently was a@@ war@@ ded the con@@ gres@@ si@@ onal M@@ ed@@ al of H@@ ono@@ r for his ac@@ tions on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 8 , 200@@ 9 ."
"On that day , a col@@ um@@ n of American and A@@ f@@ gh@@ an tro@@ op@@ s were making their way through a part of A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an to help prote@@ ct a group of government off@@ ici@@ als , a group of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an government off@@ ici@@ als , who would be me@@ et@@ ing with some local v@@ ill@@ age el@@ ders ."
"The col@@ um@@ n came under am@@ bu@@ sh , and was sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded on three sid@@ es , and am@@ on@@ g@@ st many other things , C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son was recogniz@@ ed for ru@@ n@@ ning into live fi@@ re to res@@ cu@@ e the w@@ oun@@ ded and pul@@ l out the de@@ ad ."
"One of the people he res@@ cu@@ ed was a ser@@ ge@@ ant , and he and a com@@ ra@@ de were making their way to a me@@ de@@ va@@ c hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter ."
"And what was rem@@ ar@@ ka@@ ble about this day is , by she@@ er co@@ in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence , one of the me@@ de@@ va@@ c medi@@ cs happened to have a Go@@ P@@ ro cam@@ era on his hel@@ met and cap@@ tu@@ red the whole sc@@ en@@ e on cam@@ era ."
It shows C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son and his com@@ ra@@ de br@@ ing@@ ing this w@@ oun@@ ded sol@@ di@@ er who had rec@@ ei@@ ved a g@@ un@@ sh@@ ot to the ne@@ ck .
"They put him in the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , and then you see C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son b@@ end over and give him a k@@ is@@ s before he turns around to res@@ cu@@ e more ."
"I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?"
"What is that ? That is some de@@ ep , de@@ ep emot@@ ion , when you would want to do that ."
"There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?"
"You know , in the mil@@ it@@ ary , they give me@@ d@@ als to people who are w@@ ill@@ ing to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice themselves so that others may ga@@ in ."
"In business , we give b@@ on@@ us@@ es to people who are w@@ ill@@ ing to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice others so that we may ga@@ in ."
We have it back@@ wards . R@@ ight ?
"So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?"
And my in@@ iti@@ al con@@ clu@@ sion was that they &apos;re just better people .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re at@@ tra@@ cted to the mil@@ it@@ ary .
These better people are at@@ tra@@ cted to this conc@@ ept of ser@@ vice .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
"What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the cap@@ ac@@ ity to do these rem@@ ar@@ ka@@ ble things , and more import@@ an@@ tly , others have that cap@@ ac@@ ity too ."
"I &apos;ve had the great ho@@ no@@ r of getting to me@@ et some of these , who we would call her@@ o@@ es , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to s@@ ave others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?"
Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s this de@@ ep sense of tru@@ st and co@@ oper@@ ation .
So tru@@ st and co@@ oper@@ ation are really important here .
"The problem with conc@@ ep@@ ts of tru@@ st and co@@ oper@@ ation is that they are feel@@ ings , they are not instru@@ ctions ."
"I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; T@@ ru@@ st me , &quot; &quot; and you will ."
"I can &apos;t simply instru@@ ct two people to co@@ oper@@ ate , and they will ."
It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feel@@ ing .
So where does that feel@@ ing come from ?
"If you go back 5@@ 0,000 years to the P@@ al@@ e@@ ol@@ i@@ th@@ ic era , to the early days of H@@ om@@ o sa@@ pi@@ ens , what we find is that the world was f@@ ill@@ ed with dan@@ ger , all of these for@@ ces working very , very hard to k@@ ill us ."
N@@ o@@ thing pers@@ onal .
"Wh@@ e@@ ther it was the we@@ a@@ ther , l@@ ack of resour@@ ces , maybe a s@@ ab@@ er@@ -@@ to@@ o@@ th@@ ed ti@@ ger , all of these things working to re@@ du@@ ce our li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an ."
"And so we evol@@ ved into social animals , where we li@@ ved together and worked together in what I call a cir@@ cle of sa@@ f@@ ety , inside the tri@@ be , where we felt like we bel@@ on@@ g@@ ed ."
"And when we felt sa@@ fe am@@ on@@ g@@ st our own , the natural re@@ action was tru@@ st and co@@ oper@@ ation ."
There are in@@ her@@ ent ben@@ ef@@ its to this .
It means I can f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep at night and tru@@ st that someone from within my tri@@ be will wat@@ ch for dan@@ ger .
"If we don &apos;t tru@@ st each other , if I don &apos;t tru@@ st you , that means you won &apos;t wat@@ ch for dan@@ ger ."
B@@ ad system of survi@@ val .
The mo@@ der@@ n day is exactly the same thing .
"The world is f@@ ill@@ ed with dan@@ ger , things that are trying to f@@ ru@@ str@@ ate our lives or re@@ du@@ ce our succ@@ ess , re@@ du@@ ce our opport@@ unity for succ@@ ess ."
"It could be the u@@ ps and do@@ w@@ ns in the economy , the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of the sto@@ ck market ."
It could be a new technology that ren@@ ders your business model ob@@ sol@@ ete over@@ night .
O@@ r it could be your comp@@ et@@ ition that is sometimes trying to k@@ ill you .
"It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very min@@ im@@ um is working hard to f@@ ru@@ str@@ ate your growth and ste@@ al your business from you ."
We have no control over these for@@ ces .
"Th@@ ese are a con@@ st@@ ant , and they &apos;re not going away ."
"The only vari@@ able are the cond@@ itions inside the organiz@@ ation , and that &apos;s where lea@@ der@@ ship mat@@ ters , because it &apos;s the le@@ ad@@ er that s@@ ets the t@@ one ."
"When a le@@ ad@@ er makes the cho@@ ice to put the sa@@ f@@ ety and lives of the people inside the organiz@@ ation first , to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice their com@@ for@@ ts and s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice the tan@@ gi@@ ble resul@@ ts , so that the people re@@ ma@@ in and feel sa@@ fe and feel like they bel@@ ong , rem@@ ar@@ ka@@ ble things happen ."
"I was fl@@ ying on a tri@@ p , and I was w@@ it@@ ness to an in@@ ci@@ dent where a pas@@ sen@@ ger at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted to bo@@ ard before their number was called , and I wat@@ ched the g@@ ate ag@@ ent tre@@ at this man like he had bro@@ k@@ en the la@@ w , like a cri@@ min@@ al ."
He was y@@ ell@@ ed at for at@@ tem@@ p@@ ting to bo@@ ard one group too so@@ on .
So I said something .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have tre@@ at us like cat@@ tle ?"
Why can &apos;t you tre@@ at us like human be@@ ings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ ir , if I don &apos;t fol@@ low the ru@@ les , I could get in t@@ rou@@ ble or lo@@ se my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel sa@@ fe . All she was telling me is th@@ at@@ "
she doesn &apos;t tru@@ st her lea@@ ders .
The reason we like fl@@ ying S@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ir@@ lin@@ es is not because they ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily hi@@ re better people .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fe@@ ar their lea@@ ders .
"You see , if the cond@@ itions are wrong , we are for@@ ced to ex@@ p@@ end our own time and energy to prote@@ ct ourselves from each other , and that in@@ her@@ ently we@@ ak@@ ens the organiz@@ ation ."
"When we feel sa@@ fe inside the organiz@@ ation , we will nat@@ ur@@ ally com@@ b@@ ine our tal@@ ents and our str@@ eng@@ ths and work ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly to face the dan@@ g@@ ers outside and se@@ ize the opport@@ unities ."
"The clo@@ s@@ est anal@@ og@@ y I can give to what a great le@@ ad@@ er is , is like being a par@@ ent ."
"If you think about what being a great par@@ ent is , what do you want ? What makes a great par@@ ent ?"
"We want to give our child opport@@ unities , education , dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine them when ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ary , all so that they can grow up and achi@@ eve more than we could for ourselves ."
Gre@@ at lea@@ ders want exactly the same thing .
"They want to pro@@ vide their people opport@@ unity , education , dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine when ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ary , build their self-@@ con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence , give them the opport@@ unity to try and fa@@ il , all so that they could achi@@ eve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves ."
"Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e K@@ im , who &apos;s the C@@ E@@ O of a company called N@@ ex@@ t J@@ um@@ p in New York C@@ ity , a te@@ ch company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consi@@ der la@@ ying off one of your children ?"
We would never do it .
Th@@ en why do we consi@@ der la@@ ying off people inside our organiz@@ ation ?
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e im@@ ple@@ men@@ ted a po@@ lic@@ y of li@@ f@@ et@@ im@@ e em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment .
"If you get a job at N@@ ex@@ t J@@ um@@ p , you can@@ not get fi@@ red for per@@ form@@ ance issu@@ es ."
"In fact , if you have issu@@ es , they will co@@ ach you and they will give you sup@@ port , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school ."
It &apos;s the compl@@ ete op@@ pos@@ ite .
"This is the reason so many people have such a vis@@ cer@@ al h@@ at@@ red , an@@ ger , at some of these ban@@ king C@@ E@@ O@@ s with their dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate s@@ al@@ ari@@ es and b@@ on@@ us struc@@ tures ."
It &apos;s not the num@@ bers .
It &apos;s that they have viol@@ ated the very de@@ fin@@ ition of lea@@ der@@ ship .
They have viol@@ ated this de@@ ep@@ -@@ se@@ ated social con@@ tra@@ ct .
"We know that they allo@@ wed their people to be s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed so they could prote@@ ct their own interest@@ s , or wor@@ se , they s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed their people to prote@@ ct their own interest@@ s ."
"This is what so off@@ ends us , not the num@@ bers ."
W@@ ould any@@ body be off@@ en@@ ded if we gave a $ 1@@ 50 million b@@ on@@ us to G@@ an@@ d@@ h@@ i ?
How about a $ 2@@ 50 million b@@ on@@ us to M@@ other T@@ er@@ es@@ a ?
Do we have an issue with that ? N@@ one at all . N@@ one at all .
Gre@@ at lea@@ ders would never s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice
the people to s@@ ave the num@@ bers .
They would so@@ on@@ er s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice the num@@ bers to s@@ ave the people .
"B@@ ob C@@ ha@@ p@@ man , who ru@@ ns a large man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing company in the M@@ id@@ w@@ est called B@@ ar@@ ry@@ -@@ W@@ eh@@ mil@@ l@@ er , in 200@@ 8 was h@@ it very hard by the rec@@ es@@ sion , and they lost 30 percent of their or@@ ders over@@ night ."
"Now in a large man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing company , this is a big de@@ al , and they could no longer af@@ for@@ d their lab@@ or po@@ ol ."
"They needed to s@@ ave 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the bo@@ ard got together and disc@@ us@@ sed la@@ y@@ off@@ s ."
And B@@ ob re@@ f@@ used .
"You see , B@@ ob doesn &apos;t believe in head coun@@ ts ."
"B@@ ob beli@@ ev@@ es in heart coun@@ ts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply re@@ du@@ ce the heart coun@@ t ."
And so they came up with a f@@ ur@@ l@@ ough progra@@ m .
"E@@ very em@@ plo@@ y@@ ee , from se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary to C@@ E@@ O , was re@@ qui@@ red to take four we@@ eks of un@@ pa@@ id v@@ ac@@ ation ."
"They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it con@@ se@@ cu@@ ti@@ vely ."
But it was how B@@ ob an@@ no@@ un@@ ced the progra@@ m that mat@@ ter@@ ed so much .
"He said , it &apos;s better that we should all su@@ ff@@ er a little than any of us should have to su@@ ff@@ er a lot , and mor@@ ale went up ."
"They sav@@ ed 20 million dollars , and most import@@ an@@ tly , as would be expe@@ cted , when the people feel sa@@ fe and prote@@ cted by the lea@@ der@@ ship in the organiz@@ ation , the natural re@@ action is to tru@@ st and co@@ oper@@ ate ."
"And quite s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously , no@@ body expe@@ cted , people started tra@@ ding with each other ."
Th@@ ose who could af@@ for@@ d it more would tra@@ de with those who could af@@ for@@ d it less .
P@@ eople would take five we@@ eks so that somebody else only had to take three .
Le@@ a@@ der@@ ship is a cho@@ ice . It is not a ran@@ k .
I know many people at the s@@ eni@@ or@@ most le@@ vel@@ s of organiz@@ ations who are absol@@ ut@@ ely not lea@@ ders .
"They are au@@ th@@ or@@ ities , and we do what they say because they have au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over us , but we would not fol@@ low them ."
"And I know many people who are at the bot@@ tom@@ s of organiz@@ ations who have no au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and they are absol@@ ut@@ ely lea@@ ders , and this is because they have cho@@ se@@ n to look after the person to the left of them , and they have cho@@ se@@ n to look after the person to the right of them ."
This is what a le@@ ad@@ er is .
"I heard a story of some Mar@@ ines who were out in the@@ ater , and as is the Mar@@ ine cu@@ sto@@ m , the off@@ ic@@ er ate last , and he let his men e@@ at first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him ."
"And when they went back out in the fiel@@ d , his men b@@ rou@@ ght him some of their food so that he may e@@ at , because that &apos;s what happens ."
We call them lea@@ ders because they go first .
We call them lea@@ ders because they take the risk before any@@ body else does .
"We call them lea@@ ders because they will cho@@ ose to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice so that their people may be sa@@ fe and prote@@ cted and so their people may ga@@ in , and when we do , the natural respon@@ se is that our people will s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice for us ."
"They will give us their blo@@ od and s@@ we@@ at and te@@ ar@@ s to see that their le@@ ad@@ er &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?"
Why would you give your blo@@ od and s@@ we@@ at and te@@ ar@@ s for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
And isn &apos;t that the organiz@@ ation we would all like to work in ?

There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can sol@@ ve — the part of this problem I have sp@@ ent my life working on .
The problem star@@ ts during pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cy .

"A@@ t the moment of bir@@ th , this communic@@ ation needs to stop ."
"If it doesn &apos;t close , the bab@@ y has a h@@ ole in the heart ."
It is cau@@ sed by pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ity and genet@@ ic cond@@ itions .

The only thing that would not bur@@ n in the fi@@ re was a gre@@ en av@@ oc@@ a@@ do b@@ ran@@ ch .

"Mo@@ st patients can@@ not af@@ for@@ d to be tre@@ ated on time , and they die ."
The first co@@ il could succ@@ ess@@ fully tre@@ at only half of the patients in B@@ ol@@ i@@ vi@@ a .
The sear@@ ch started again .
We went back to the dra@@ wing bo@@ ard .
"A@@ f@@ ter many tri@@ als , and with the help of my gran@@ d@@ mother &apos;s indi@@ gen@@ ous friends in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins , we ob@@ ta@@ ined a new de@@ vice ."
"For cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es , indi@@ gen@@ ous women told stories by we@@ av@@ ing complex patter@@ ns on lo@@ om@@ s , and an u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted sk@@ ill hel@@ ped us for the new de@@ vice ."
We take this trad@@ iti@@ onal me@@ th@@ od of we@@ av@@ ing and make a design made by a sm@@ art material that recor@@ ds sh@@ ape .
"It se@@ ems this time , the we@@ av@@ ing allo@@ ws us to create a se@@ am@@ less de@@ vice that doesn &apos;t ru@@ st because it &apos;s made of only one piece ."
It can change by itself into very complex struc@@ tures by a proc@@ ed@@ ure that took dec@@ ad@@ es to devel@@ op .
"As you can see , the de@@ vice en@@ ters the body through the natural chan@@ n@@ els ."
D@@ oc@@ tors have only to close the ca@@ th@@ et@@ er through the h@@ ole .
"O@@ ur de@@ vice ex@@ pan@@ ds , places itself and clo@@ ses the h@@ ole ."
We have this beautiful deli@@ very system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .
No open sur@@ ger@@ y was ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ary .
"( Applause ) A@@ s doc@@ tors , we fi@@ ght with dise@@ ases that take a long time and ef@@ for@@ t to he@@ al — if they do ."
"This is the child from before , after the proc@@ ed@@ ure ."
"As you can see — ( Applause ) A@@ s you can see , once the de@@ vice is in place , the pati@@ ent is 100 percent heal@@ ed ."
"F@@ rom start to fin@@ ish , the whole proc@@ ed@@ ure takes only 30 minutes ."
That &apos;s very re@@ war@@ ding from the medi@@ cal and human point of view .
"We are so pro@@ u@@ d that some of our form@@ er patients are part of our team — a team , th@@ an@@ ks to ad@@ ded close inter@@ action with patients that work with us ."
"T@@ og@@ e@@ ther , we have only one idea : the best sol@@ utions need to be simple ."
We lost the fe@@ ar of cre@@ ating something new .
"The pat@@ h , it &apos;s not easy ."
M@@ any ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les ari@@ se all the time .
But we rec@@ ei@@ ve str@@ eng@@ th from our patients .
Th@@ e@@ ir res@@ ili@@ ence and cou@@ ra@@ ge in@@ spi@@ re our cre@@ ativ@@ ity .
"O@@ ur go@@ al is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or acc@@ ess ."
So we have to start a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation with a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one model .
We will give one de@@ vice for free to make sure that every child is tre@@ ated .
"We are in many countries now , but we need to be every@@ where ."
"This whole thing beg@@ an with one im@@ possible idea as will contin@@ ue it , really : No child is left behind ."
M@@ uch@@ as gra@@ ci@@ as .
( Applause )
"So I gre@@ w up in L@@ im@@ po@@ po , on the bor@@ der of L@@ im@@ po@@ po and M@@ p@@ um@@ al@@ an@@ ga , a little to@@ wn called M@@ ot@@ et@@ em@@ a ."
"W@@ ater and electri@@ city sup@@ ply are as un@@ predi@@ c@@ table as the we@@ a@@ ther , and gro@@ wing up in these t@@ ough situ@@ ations , at the age of 1@@ 7 , I was re@@ la@@ x@@ ing with a couple of friends of m@@ ine in win@@ ter , and we were su@@ n@@ ba@@ thing ."
The L@@ im@@ po@@ po su@@ n gets really ho@@ t in win@@ ter .
"So as we were su@@ n@@ ba@@ thing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , why doesn &apos;t somebody inv@@ ent something that you can just put on your sk@@ in and then you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ? &quot; &quot; And I s@@ at , and I was like , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , I would bu@@ y that , e@@ h ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very sho@@ c@@ king stati@@ st@@ ics ."
O@@ ver 2@@ .@@ 5 billion people in the world today do not have pro@@ per acc@@ ess to water and san@@ it@@ ation .
"F@@ our hun@@ d@@ red and fi@@ f@@ ty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in S@@ outh Africa ."
"V@@ ari@@ ous dise@@ ases th@@ ri@@ ve in this environment , the most d@@ rast@@ ic of which is called tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a ."
T@@ ra@@ ch@@ om@@ a is an inf@@ ec@@ tion of the e@@ ye du@@ e to di@@ r@@ t getting into your e@@ ye . M@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple inf@@ ec@@ tions of tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a can leave you per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ ind .
"The disease le@@ av@@ es e@@ ight million people per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ ind each and every year . The sho@@ c@@ king part about it is that to av@@ o@@ id being inf@@ ec@@ ted with tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a , all you have to do is w@@ ash your face : no medi@@ c@@ ine , no p@@ ill@@ s , no in@@ jec@@ tions ."
"So after seeing these sho@@ c@@ king stati@@ st@@ ics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to ba@@ the , I at least need to do it to try to s@@ ave the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my tru@@ st@@ y little ste@@ ed , my N@@ o@@ ki@@ a 6@@ 2@@ 3@@ 4 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a la@@ p@@ top , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , exc@@ ept for the 20@@ -@@ ran@@ d-@@ an@@ -@@ h@@ our Internet ca@@ fe — I did research on W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a , on Google , about l@@ ot@@ i@@ ons , cre@@ am@@ s , the com@@ pos@@ itions , the mel@@ ting poin@@ ts , the to@@ x@@ ic@@ ities — I did high school science — and I w@@ ro@@ te down a little form@@ ul@@ a on a piece of pa@@ per ,"
"@@ and it looked like the K@@ F@@ C speci@@ al sp@@ ice , you know ?"
"So I was like , o@@ kay , so we &apos;ve got the form@@ ul@@ a ready ."
Now we need to get this thing into pra@@ cti@@ ce .
"F@@ ast for@@ ward four years later , after having writ@@ ten a 4@@ 0-@@ p@@ age business plan on the cell phone , having writ@@ ten my pat@@ ent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youn@@ g@@ est pat@@ ent@@ -@@ hol@@ der in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more ba@@ thing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had inv@@ ented D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath , the world &apos;s first ba@@ th@@ -@@ sub@@ st@@ it@@ ut@@ ing l@@ ot@@ ion ."
"You liter@@ ally put it on your sk@@ in , and you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ."
"( Laughter ) So after having tri@@ ed to make it work in high school with the lim@@ ited resour@@ ces I had , I went to univers@@ ity , met a few people , got it into pra@@ cti@@ ce , and we have a fully fun@@ cti@@ on@@ ing produc@@ t that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually av@@ ail@@ able on the market ."
So we learned a few l@@ ess@@ ons in com@@ mer@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ing and making D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath av@@ ail@@ able .
One of the things we learned was that po@@ or comm@@ unities don &apos;t bu@@ y produc@@ ts in bu@@ l@@ k .
"They bu@@ y produc@@ ts on de@@ m@@ and . A person in A@@ le@@ x doesn &apos;t bu@@ y a bo@@ x of ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ t@@ es . They bu@@ y one ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ te each day , even though it &apos;s more ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
So we p@@ ac@@ ka@@ g@@ ed D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath in these innov@@ ative little sa@@ ch@@ ets .
"You just s@@ na@@ p them in half , and you squ@@ e@@ ez@@ e it out ."
"And the co@@ ol part is , one sa@@ ch@@ et sub@@ st@@ it@@ ut@@ es one b@@ ath for five r@@ and ."
"A@@ f@@ ter cre@@ ating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of im@@ ple@@ men@@ ting the produc@@ t ."
We realized that even ri@@ ch kids from the su@@ bur@@ b@@ s really want D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath . ( Laughter ) A@@ t least once a week .
"A@@ ny@@ way , we realized that we could s@@ ave 80 million lit@@ ers of water on aver@@ age each time they s@@ ki@@ pped a b@@ ath , and also we would s@@ ave two hours a day for kids who are in ru@@ ral are@@ as , two hours more for school , two hours more for hom@@ e@@ work , two hours more to just be a ki@@ d ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seeing that global imp@@ act , we nar@@ ro@@ wed it down to our key val@@ ue pro@@ pos@@ ition , which was cle@@ an@@ lin@@ ess and con@@ v@@ eni@@ ence ."
D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath is a ri@@ ch man &apos;s con@@ v@@ eni@@ ence and a po@@ or man &apos;s li@@ f@@ es@@ av@@ er .
"H@@ av@@ ing put the produc@@ t into pra@@ cti@@ ce , we are actually now on the ver@@ ge of sel@@ ling the produc@@ t on@@ to a mul@@ tin@@ ational to take it to the re@@ ta@@ il market , and one question I have for the audi@@ ence today is , on the g@@ rav@@ el ro@@ ads of L@@ im@@ po@@ po , with an allo@@ wan@@ ce of 50 r@@ and a week , I came up with a way for the world not to ba@@ the ."
What &apos;s sto@@ pp@@ ing you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
"And another key thing that I learned a lot throu@@ gh@@ out this whole process , last year Google na@@ med me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young min@@ ds in the world ."
"I &apos;m also cur@@ r@@ ently the best stud@@ ent ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur in the world , the first Afri@@ can to get that ac@@ col@@ a@@ de , and one thing that really pu@@ z@@ z@@ les me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to ba@@ the . Thank you ."
( Applause . )
"F@@ i@@ ve years ago , I was on a s@@ ab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal , and I re@@ turned to the medi@@ cal univers@@ ity where I studi@@ ed ."
"I saw real patients and I wor@@ e the white co@@ at for the first time in 1@@ 7 years , in fact since I became a manag@@ ement con@@ sul@@ t@@ ant ."
There were two things that surpri@@ sed me during the mon@@ th I sp@@ ent .
"The first one was that the common them@@ e of the disc@@ us@@ sions we had were hosp@@ ital bud@@ gets and co@@ st@@ -@@ c@@ ut@@ ting , and the second thing , which really bo@@ ther@@ ed me , actually , was that sever@@ al of the colle@@ ag@@ ues I met , form@@ er friends from medi@@ cal school , who I knew to be some of the sm@@ ar@@ test , most mot@@ iv@@ ated , eng@@ ag@@ ed and pas@@ sion@@ ate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cy@@ ni@@ cal , dis@@ eng@@ ag@@ ed , or had di@@ stan@@ ced themselves from hosp@@ ital manag@@ ement ."
"So with this foc@@ us on co@@ st@@ -@@ c@@ ut@@ ting , I asked myself , are we for@@ getting the pati@@ ent ?"
M@@ any countries that you re@@ present and where I come from stru@@ gg@@ le with the cost of heal@@ th@@ care .
It &apos;s a big part of the national bud@@ gets .
And many different re@@ form@@ s a@@ im at hol@@ ding back this growth .
"In some countries , we have long wa@@ iting times for patients for sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"In other countries , new dru@@ gs are not being re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , and th@@ ere@@ fore don &apos;t re@@ ach patients ."
"In sever@@ al countries , doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses are the tar@@ gets , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , for the govern@@ ments ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , the co@@ st@@ ly deci@@ sions in health care are taken by doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses ."
"You cho@@ ose an ex@@ pen@@ sive la@@ b test , you cho@@ ose to oper@@ ate on an old and fra@@ il pati@@ ent ."
"So , by lim@@ iting the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom of physi@@ ci@@ ans , this is a way to h@@ old co@@ sts down ."
"And ul@@ tim@@ ately , some physi@@ ci@@ ans will say today that they don &apos;t have the full li@@ ber@@ ty to make the cho@@ ices they think are right for their patients ."
So no won@@ der that some of my old colle@@ ag@@ ues are f@@ ru@@ strat@@ ed .
"A@@ t B@@ C@@ G , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of manag@@ ing heal@@ th@@ care ."
"And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achi@@ eve ? &quot;"
"U@@ l@@ tim@@ ately , in the heal@@ th@@ care system , we &apos;re a@@ im@@ ing at impro@@ ving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a lim@@ ited , or af@@ for@@ d@@ able , cost ."
We call this val@@ u@@ e-@@ based heal@@ th@@ care .
"On the scre@@ en behind me , you see what we mean by val@@ ue : out@@ comes that matter to patients rel@@ ative to the money we spend ."
This was descri@@ bed beauti@@ fully in a book in 200@@ 6 by M@@ i@@ cha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter and E@@ li@@ zab@@ et@@ h T@@ e@@ is@@ ber@@ g .
"On this picture , you have my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by his three beautiful d@@ augh@@ ters ."
"When we started doing our research at B@@ C@@ G , we decided not to look so much at the co@@ sts , but to look at the qu@@ ality instead , and in the research , one of the things that f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated us was the vari@@ ation we saw ."
"You comp@@ are hosp@@ it@@ als in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are va@@ st@@ ly much wor@@ se ."
The differ@@ ences were dra@@ m@@ atic .
"E@@ ri@@ k , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w , he su@@ ff@@ ers from prost@@ ate cancer , and he probably needs sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"Now living in Euro@@ pe , he can cho@@ ose to go to Ger@@ many that has a w@@ ell@@ -@@ re@@ put@@ ed heal@@ th@@ care system ."
"If he goes there and goes to the aver@@ age hosp@@ ital , he will have the risk of be@@ coming in@@ contin@@ ent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start w@@ ear@@ ing di@@ a@@ per@@ s again ."
You f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in . F@@ i@@ f@@ ty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
"If he instead would go to H@@ am@@ bur@@ g , and to a cl@@ in@@ ic called the Mar@@ tin@@ i@@ -@@ K@@ lin@@ i@@ k , the risk would be only one in 20 ."
"E@@ i@@ ther you a f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in , or you have a one in 20 risk ."
"That &apos;s a huge difference , a se@@ ven@@ -@@ f@@ old difference ."
"When we look at many hosp@@ it@@ als for many different dise@@ ases , we see these huge differ@@ ences ."
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
"And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist ."
N@@ ob@@ ody kno@@ ws .
So going the hosp@@ ital is a l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope ."
"In the l@@ ate &apos; 7@@ 0s , there were a group of S@@ w@@ ed@@ ish or@@ th@@ o@@ pe@@ di@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons who met at their an@@ nu@@ al me@@ et@@ ing , and they were disc@@ us@@ sing the different proc@@ e@@ du@@ res they used to oper@@ ate hi@@ p sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"To the left of this sli@@ de , you see a vari@@ ety of met@@ al pi@@ ec@@ es , arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al hi@@ ps that you would use for somebody who needs a new hi@@ p ."
They all realized they had their individu@@ al way of oper@@ ating .
"They all argu@@ ed that , &quot; &quot; My tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e is the best , &quot; &quot; but no@@ ne of them actually knew , and they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that ."
"So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to meas@@ ure qu@@ ality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact sp@@ ent two years de@@ b@@ ating , &quot; So what is qu@@ ality in hi@@ p sur@@ ger@@ y ? &quot;"
"&quot; Oh , we should meas@@ ure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should meas@@ ure that . &quot;"
And they finally ag@@ re@@ ed .
"And once they had ag@@ re@@ ed , they started meas@@ uring , and started shar@@ ing the data ."
"V@@ ery quickly , they found that if you put c@@ ement in the b@@ one of the pati@@ ent before you put the met@@ al sh@@ af@@ t in , it actually la@@ st@@ ed a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on in their li@@ f@@ et@@ im@@ e ."
"They publi@@ shed the data , and it actually trans@@ form@@ ed cl@@ in@@ ical pra@@ cti@@ ce in the country ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body saw this makes a lot of sense .
"S@@ in@@ ce then , they publi@@ sh every year ."
"O@@ n@@ ce a year , they publi@@ sh the le@@ ag@@ ue table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bot@@ tom ?"
"And they vi@@ sit each other to try to learn , so a contin@@ u@@ ous cy@@ cle of impro@@ ve@@ ment ."
"For many years , S@@ w@@ ed@@ ish hi@@ p sur@@ ge@@ ons had the best resul@@ ts in the world , at least for those who actually were meas@@ uring , and many were not ."
Now I found this prin@@ ci@@ ple really exc@@ iting .
"So the physi@@ ci@@ ans get together , they ag@@ ree on what qu@@ ality is , they start meas@@ uring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it ."
Con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous impro@@ ve@@ ment .
"Now , that &apos;s not the only exc@@ iting part ."
That &apos;s exc@@ iting in itself .
"But if you bring back the cost side of the equ@@ ation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have foc@@ used on qu@@ ality , they actually also have the lo@@ w@@ est co@@ sts , al@@ though that &apos;s not been the pur@@ pose in the first place ."
"So if you look at the hi@@ p sur@@ ger@@ y story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they com@@ pa@@ red the U.@@ S. and S@@ w@@ ed@@ en ."
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on se@@ ven years after the first sur@@ ger@@ y .
"In the United States , the number was three times high@@ er than in S@@ w@@ ed@@ en ."
"So many un@@ ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ary sur@@ g@@ eri@@ es , and so much un@@ ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ary su@@ ff@@ ering for all the patients who were oper@@ ated on in that se@@ ven year period ."
"Now , you can imagine how much sav@@ ings there would be for society ."
We did a study where we looked at O@@ E@@ C@@ D data .
"O@@ E@@ C@@ D does , every so often , look at qu@@ ality of care where they can find the data across the mem@@ ber countries ."
"The United States has , for many dise@@ ases , actually a qu@@ ality which is bel@@ ow the aver@@ age in O@@ E@@ C@@ D ."
"Now , if the American heal@@ th@@ care system would foc@@ us a lot more on meas@@ uring qu@@ ality , and ra@@ ise qu@@ ality just to the level of aver@@ age O@@ E@@ C@@ D , it would s@@ ave the American people 500 billion U.@@ S. dollars a year ."
"That &apos;s 20 percent of the bud@@ get , of the heal@@ th@@ care bud@@ get of the country ."
"Now you may say that these num@@ bers are fanta@@ st@@ ic , and it &apos;s all lo@@ g@@ ical , but is it possible ?"
"This would be a pa@@ radi@@ g@@ m shi@@ ft in heal@@ th@@ care , and I would argu@@ e that not only can it be done , but it has to be done ."
The ag@@ ents of change are the doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses in the heal@@ th@@ care system .
"In my pra@@ cti@@ ce as a con@@ sul@@ t@@ ant , I me@@ et probably a hun@@ d@@ red or more than a hun@@ d@@ red doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses and other hosp@@ ital or heal@@ th@@ care st@@ af@@ f every year ."
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achi@@ eve in terms of qu@@ ality for their patients .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans are , like most of you in the audi@@ ence , very comp@@ et@@ itive ."
They were always best in clas@@ s .
We were always best in clas@@ s .
"And if somebody can show them that the resul@@ t they per@@ form for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do what@@ ever it takes to impro@@ ve ."
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physi@@ ci@@ ans have another charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ic .
They actually th@@ ri@@ ve from pe@@ er recog@@ n@@ ition .
"If a car@@ di@@ olog@@ ist call@@ s another car@@ di@@ olog@@ ist in a comp@@ et@@ ing hosp@@ ital and disc@@ us@@ ses why that other hosp@@ ital has so much better resul@@ ts , they will share ."
They will share the information on how to impro@@ ve .
"So it is , by meas@@ uring and cre@@ ating tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy , you get a cy@@ cle of contin@@ u@@ ous impro@@ ve@@ ment , which is what this sli@@ de shows ."
"Now , you may say this is a ni@@ ce idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea ."
This is happening in reality .
"We &apos;re cre@@ ating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to meas@@ ure and comp@@ are what we achi@@ eve ."
"T@@ og@@ e@@ ther with two ac@@ a@@ de@@ mic instit@@ utions , M@@ i@@ cha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ in@@ ess S@@ cho@@ ol , and the Ka@@ ro@@ lin@@ s@@ ka In@@ st@@ it@@ ute in S@@ w@@ ed@@ en , B@@ C@@ G has form@@ ed something we call I@@ C@@ H@@ O@@ M ."
"You may think that &apos;s a s@@ ne@@ ez@@ e , but it &apos;s not a s@@ ne@@ ez@@ e , it &apos;s an ac@@ ro@@ nym ."
It stan@@ ds for the Inter@@ national Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um for H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ ut@@ come M@@ eas@@ u@@ re@@ ment .
"We &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing together le@@ ad@@ ing physi@@ ci@@ ans and patients to disc@@ us@@ s , disease by disease , what is really qu@@ ality , what should we meas@@ ure , and to make those stan@@ dar@@ ds global ."
"They &apos;ve worked — four working grou@@ ps have worked during the past year : cat@@ a@@ rac@@ ts , back pa@@ in , c@@ oro@@ n@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y disease , which is , for in@@ stance , heart atta@@ ck , and prost@@ ate cancer ."
The four grou@@ ps will publi@@ sh their data in N@@ ov@@ ember of this year .
"That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be com@@ par@@ ing ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples , not only within a country , but between countries ."
"N@@ ex@@ t year , we &apos;re plan@@ ning to do e@@ ight dise@@ ases , the year after , 1@@ 6 ."
"In three years &apos; time , we plan to have c@@ over@@ ed 40 percent of the disease bur@@ den ."
C@@ om@@ p@@ are ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples . Wh@@ o &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
"F@@ i@@ ve months ago , I led a work@@ sho@@ p at the lar@@ g@@ est univers@@ ity hosp@@ ital in Nor@@ ther@@ n Euro@@ pe ."
"They have a new C@@ E@@ O , and she has a vision : I want to man@@ age my big instit@@ ution much more on qu@@ ality , out@@ comes that matter to patients ."
"This particular day , we s@@ at in a work@@ sho@@ p together with physi@@ ci@@ ans , n@@ ur@@ ses and other st@@ af@@ f , disc@@ us@@ sing le@@ u@@ k@@ em@@ ia in children ."
"The group disc@@ us@@ sed , how do we meas@@ ure qu@@ ality today ?"
C@@ an we meas@@ ure it better than we do ?
"We disc@@ us@@ sed , how do we tre@@ at these kids , what are important impro@@ ve@@ ments ?"
"And we disc@@ us@@ sed what are the co@@ sts for these patients , can we do tre@@ at@@ ment more eff@@ ici@@ ently ?"
There was an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous energy in the room .
"There were so many ideas , so much en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m ."
"A@@ t the end of the me@@ et@@ ing , the cha@@ ir@@ man of the de@@ part@@ ment , he sto@@ od up ."
"He looked over the group and he said — first he ra@@ is@@ ed his hand , I for@@ got that — he ra@@ is@@ ed his hand , c@@ len@@ ched his f@@ ist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
"Th@@ ank you . T@@ oday , we &apos;re finally disc@@ us@@ sing what this hosp@@ ital does the right way . &quot; &quot; B@@ y meas@@ uring val@@ ue in heal@@ th@@ care , that is not only co@@ sts but out@@ comes that matter to patients , we will make st@@ af@@ f in hosp@@ it@@ als and el@@ se@@ where in the heal@@ th@@ care system not a problem but an important part of the solution ."
"I believe meas@@ uring val@@ ue in heal@@ th@@ care will bring about a revol@@ ution , and I &apos;m con@@ vin@@ ced that the f@@ oun@@ der of mo@@ der@@ n medi@@ c@@ ine , the Gre@@ ek H@@ i@@ p@@ po@@ c@@ rat@@ es , who always put the pati@@ ent at the cent@@ er , he would sm@@ ile in his gra@@ ve ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"I &apos;m really exc@@ ited to share with you some fin@@ din@@ gs that really surpri@@ se me about what makes companies succ@@ e@@ ed the most , what fac@@ tors actually matter the most for star@@ tu@@ p succ@@ ess ."
I believe that the star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation is one of the gre@@ at@@ est form@@ s to make the world a better place .
You get them to achi@@ eve un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able things .
So I looked at these five .
I used to think that the idea was everything .
"But then over time , I came to think that maybe the team , the ex@@ ec@@ ution , ada@@ p@@ ta@@ bil@@ ity , that mat@@ ter@@ ed even more than the idea ."
"I never thought I &apos;d be quot@@ ing bo@@ x@@ er M@@ ike T@@ y@@ son on the TED stage , but he once said , &quot; &quot; E@@ ver@@ y@@ body has a plan , until they get p@@ un@@ ched in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well ."
D@@ o@@ es the company have a very clear pat@@ h gener@@ ating cu@@ st@@ om@@ er re@@ ven@@ ues ?
That started ri@@ sing to the top in my thinking about maybe what mat@@ ter@@ ed most for succ@@ ess .
S@@ omet@@ imes companies rec@@ ei@@ ved in@@ ten@@ se amoun@@ ts of fun@@ ding .
So I tri@@ ed to ran@@ k across all of those at@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ es how I felt those companies s@@ co@@ red on each of those d@@ imen@@ sions .
"And then for no@@ n-@@ I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies , I looked at w@@ il@@ d succ@@ ess@@ es , like A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b and In@@ st@@ ag@@ ra@@ m and U@@ ber and Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be and L@@ in@@ k@@ ed@@ In ."

"I was le@@ av@@ ing a se@@ min@@ ar when it started , hum@@ ming to myself , f@@ um@@ bl@@ ing with my ba@@ g just as I &apos;d done a hun@@ d@@ red times before , when sud@@ den@@ ly I heard a vo@@ ice cal@@ m@@ ly ob@@ ser@@ ve , &quot; She is le@@ av@@ ing the room . &quot;"
"I looked around , and there was no one there , but the c@@ lar@@ ity and deci@@ si@@ ven@@ ess of the com@@ ment was un@@ mi@@ sta@@ ka@@ ble ."
&quot; She is op@@ ening the do@@ or . &quot;
This was the beginning . The vo@@ ice had ar@@ ri@@ ved .
"And the vo@@ ice per@@ sist@@ ed , days and then we@@ eks of it , on and on , nar@@ rat@@ ing everything I did in the third person ."
&quot; She is going to a le@@ c@@ ture . &quot;
"It was ne@@ ut@@ ral , im@@ pas@@ sive and even , after a while , stran@@ g@@ ely compani@@ on@@ ate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , al@@ though I did not@@ ice that its cal@@ m ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or sometimes sli@@ pped and that it oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally mir@@ ro@@ red my own u@@ ne@@ x@@ pres@@ sed emot@@ ion ."
"So , for example , if I was ang@@ ry and had to hi@@ de it , which I often did , being very a@@ de@@ pt at conc@@ e@@ al@@ ing how I really felt , then the vo@@ ice would sound f@@ ru@@ strat@@ ed ."
"A sub@@ tle cond@@ iti@@ on@@ ing process had be@@ gu@@ n , the imp@@ lic@@ ation that norm@@ al people don &apos;t hear vo@@ ices and the fact that I did me@@ ant that something was very seri@@ ously wrong ."
I sp@@ ent some time telling the colle@@ ge G@@ .@@ P@@ .
"And to be fa@@ ir , I was des@@ per@@ ate for inter@@ est and help , and I beg@@ an to tell him about my stran@@ ge com@@ men@@ tat@@ or ."
"For example , I was part of a stud@@ ent T@@ V st@@ ation that bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast news bu@@ l@@ let@@ ins around the cam@@ p@@ us , and during an ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment which was ru@@ n@@ ning very l@@ ate , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , doc@@ tor , I &apos;ve got to go ."
It was at this point that ev@@ ents beg@@ an to ra@@ pi@@ dly over@@ take me .
"A hosp@@ ital ad@@ mis@@ sion fol@@ lo@@ wed , the first of many , a diag@@ nos@@ is of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ eni@@ a came next , and then , wor@@ st of all , a to@@ x@@ ic , tor@@ men@@ ting sense of ho@@ p@@ el@@ es@@ sn@@ ess , hum@@ ili@@ ation and des@@ pa@@ ir about myself and my pro@@ spe@@ c@@ ts ."
"But having been en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to see the vo@@ ice not as an experience but as a sy@@ mp@@ tom , my fe@@ ar and re@@ si@@ stance to@@ wards it in@@ ten@@ si@@ fi@@ ed ."
"Now es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally , this re@@ pres@@ ented taking an ag@@ gres@@ sive stance to@@ wards my own mind , a kind of p@@ sy@@ chi@@ c ci@@ vil war , and in turn this cau@@ sed the number of vo@@ ices to incre@@ ase and grow progres@@ si@@ vely ho@@ st@@ ile and men@@ ac@@ ing ."
You see that glas@@ s of water ?
"In eff@@ ect , a vi@@ ci@@ ous cy@@ cle of fe@@ ar , av@@ o@@ i@@ dan@@ ce , mi@@ stru@@ st and mis@@ under@@ standing had been est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed , and this was a bat@@ tle in which I felt power@@ less and in@@ cap@@ able of est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing any kind of pe@@ ace or re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation ."
"T@@ w@@ o years later , and the det@@ eri@@ or@@ ation was dra@@ m@@ atic ."
"B@@ y now , I had the whole f@@ ren@@ z@@ i@@ ed re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re : ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying vo@@ ices , gro@@ t@@ es@@ qu@@ e vi@@ sions , biz@@ ar@@ re , in@@ tra@@ c@@ table del@@ u@@ sions ."
"Now looking back on the w@@ rec@@ ka@@ ge and des@@ pa@@ ir of those years , it se@@ ems to me now as if someone di@@ ed in that place , and yet , someone else was sav@@ ed ."
"A bro@@ k@@ en and h@@ au@@ n@@ ted person beg@@ an that jour@@ ney , but the person who em@@ er@@ g@@ ed was a survi@@ vo@@ r and would ul@@ tim@@ ately grow into the person I was dest@@ ined to be ."
"M@@ any people have har@@ med me in my life , and I remember them all , but the mem@@ ories grow p@@ ale and fa@@ in@@ t in com@@ par@@ is@@ on with the people who &apos;ve hel@@ ped me ."
I believe that E@@ le@@ an@@ or can get through this .
"S@@ omet@@ imes , you know , it s@@ no@@ ws as l@@ ate as M@@ ay , but sum@@ mer always comes ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ te@@ en minutes is not enough time to fully cre@@ dit those good and gener@@ ous people who f@@ ou@@ ght with me and for me and who wa@@ ited to w@@ el@@ come me back from that ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ed , lon@@ ely place ."
"Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the vo@@ ices appe@@ a@@ red so ho@@ st@@ ile and men@@ ac@@ ing , so in this re@@ spe@@ ct , a v@@ ital first step was learning to se@@ par@@ ate out a met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical me@@ an@@ ing from what I &apos;d pre@@ vi@@ ously inter@@ pre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al tru@@ th ."
"So for example , vo@@ ices which thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to atta@@ ck my home I learned to inter@@ pre@@ t as my own sense of fe@@ ar and in@@ se@@ cur@@ ity in the world , rather than an ac@@ tual , ob@@ jec@@ tive dan@@ ger ."
"Now at first , I would have beli@@ ev@@ ed them ."
"I remember , for example , sit@@ ting up one night on gu@@ ard outside my parents &apos; room to prote@@ ct them from what I thought was a gen@@ u@@ ine thre@@ at from the vo@@ ices ."
"It was like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t m@@ ess with me ."
"I &apos;ve got a plast@@ ic for@@ k , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ at@@ e@@ gic ."

( Applause )
I &apos;m here to share my photogra@@ ph@@ y .
O@@ r is it photogra@@ ph@@ y ?
"Because , of course , this is a photogra@@ ph that you can &apos;t take with your cam@@ era ."
"@@ Y@@ et , my inter@@ est in photogra@@ ph@@ y started as I got my first dig@@ ital cam@@ era at the age of 15 ."
"It mi@@ x@@ ed with my ear@@ li@@ er pas@@ sion for dra@@ wing , but it was a bit different , because using the cam@@ era , the process was in the plan@@ ning instead ."
"And when you take a photogra@@ ph with a cam@@ era , the process ends when you pres@@ s the tri@@ g@@ ger ."
So to me it felt like photogra@@ ph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like any@@ one could do that .
"So I wanted to create something different , something where the process star@@ ts when you pres@@ s the tri@@ g@@ ger ."
P@@ hot@@ os like this : con@@ stru@@ ction going on along a bu@@ sy ro@@ ad .
But it has an u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted tw@@ ist .
"And des@@ p@@ ite that , it re@@ ta@@ ins a level of re@@ al@@ ism ."
"O@@ r ph@@ ot@@ os like these — both dar@@ k and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common go@@ al of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of re@@ al@@ ism ."
"When I say re@@ al@@ ism , I mean ph@@ ot@@ o-@@ re@@ al@@ ism ."
"Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tu@@ red some@@ how as a photogra@@ ph ."
P@@ hot@@ os where you will need a bri@@ e@@ f moment to think to figure out the tri@@ ck .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea than about cap@@ tur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the tri@@ ck that makes it look re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic ?
I@@ s it something about the det@@ ail@@ s or the col@@ ors ?
I@@ s it something about the light ?
What cre@@ ates the il@@ lu@@ sion ?
S@@ omet@@ imes the perspe@@ ctive is the il@@ lu@@ sion .
"But in the end , it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a tw@@ o-@@ d@@ imen@@ si@@ onal surface ."
"It &apos;s not really what is re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic , it &apos;s what we think looks re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic really ."
So I think the ba@@ si@@ cs are quite simple .
I just see it as a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of reality where you can take different pi@@ ec@@ es of reality and put it together to create al@@ ter@@ n@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
"H@@ ere we have three perf@@ ec@@ tly imag@@ in@@ able physi@@ cal ob@@ jects , something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a thre@@ e-@@ d@@ imen@@ si@@ onal world ."
"But com@@ b@@ ined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks thre@@ e-@@ d@@ imen@@ si@@ onal , like it could ex@@ ist ."
"But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t ."
"So we tri@@ ck our bra@@ ins , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t acc@@ ept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense ."
And I see the same process with com@@ bin@@ ing photogra@@ ph@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about com@@ bin@@ ing different re@@ al@@ ities .
"So the things that make a photogra@@ ph look re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our da@@ ily lives ."
"But when com@@ bin@@ ing photogra@@ ph@@ s , this is really important to consi@@ der , because o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se it just looks wrong some@@ how ."
So I would like to say that there are three simple ru@@ les to fol@@ low to achi@@ eve a re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic resul@@ t .
"As you can see , these images are@@ n &apos;t really speci@@ al ."
"But com@@ b@@ ined , they can create something like this ."
So the first ru@@ le is that ph@@ ot@@ os com@@ b@@ ined should have the same perspe@@ ctive .
"Se@@ con@@ dly , ph@@ ot@@ os com@@ b@@ ined should have the same ty@@ pe of light ."
And these two images both ful@@ f@@ ill these two re@@ qui@@ remen@@ ts — sh@@ ot at the same he@@ ight and in the same ty@@ pe of light .
The third one is about making it im@@ possible to dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish where the different images beg@@ in and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
Ma@@ ke it im@@ possible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed .
"So by mat@@ ching col@@ or , con@@ tra@@ st and bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photogra@@ ph@@ ic def@@ ec@@ ts like de@@ p@@ th of fiel@@ d , des@@ at@@ ur@@ ated col@@ ors and no@@ ise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , des@@ p@@ ite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hun@@ dre@@ ds of la@@ y@@ ers basically ."
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape and the lo@@ wer part is what &apos;s m@@ ani@@ pul@@ ated .
But this image is actually enti@@ rely com@@ posed of photogra@@ ph@@ s from different lo@@ c@@ ations .
"I person@@ ally think that it &apos;s e@@ a@@ si@@ er to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se with the ideas in your head ."
But it does re@@ qui@@ re a lot of plan@@ ning .
"And getting this idea during win@@ ter , I knew that I had sever@@ al months to plan it , to find the different lo@@ c@@ ations for the pi@@ ec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le basically ."
"So for example , the fish was cap@@ tu@@ red on a fi@@ sh@@ ing tri@@ p ."
The sho@@ res are from a different lo@@ c@@ ation .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tu@@ red in a st@@ one p@@ it .
"And ye@@ ah , I even turned the house on top of the isl@@ and red to make it look more S@@ w@@ ed@@ ish ."
"So to achi@@ eve a re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic resul@@ t , I think it comes down to plan@@ ning ."
"It always star@@ ts with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea ."
Th@@ en it &apos;s about com@@ bin@@ ing the different photogra@@ ph@@ s .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
"And if you do a good job cap@@ tur@@ ing the ph@@ ot@@ os , the resul@@ t can be quite beautiful and also quite re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic ."
"So all the to@@ ols are out there , and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our imag@@ in@@ ation ."
Thank you .

"@@ &#91; On A@@ pri@@ l 3 , 20@@ 1@@ 6 we saw the lar@@ g@@ est data le@@ ak in history . &#93; &#91; The P@@ an@@ am@@ a P@@ a@@ per@@ s ex@@ posed ri@@ ch and powerful people &#93; &#91; hi@@ ding v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of money in off@@ sh@@ ore ac@@ coun@@ ts . &#93; &#91; What does this mean ? &#93; &#91; We called R@@ ob@@ er@@ t P@@ al@@ mer of G@@ l@@ ob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness to expla@@ in . &#93; This week , there have been a whole sle@@ w and del@@ u@@ ge of stories coming out from the le@@ ak of 11 million do@@ cu@@ ments from a P@@ an@@ am@@ ani@@ an@@ -@@ based la@@ w fi@@ r@@ m called M@@ os@@ s@@ ack F@@ on@@ se@@ ca ."
The re@@ le@@ ase of these pa@@ per@@ s from P@@ an@@ am@@ a li@@ f@@ ts the ve@@ il on a tiny piece of the se@@ cre@@ tive off@@ sh@@ ore world .
"Now , this has already started to have pretty im@@ medi@@ ate re@@ perc@@ us@@ sions ."
The Pri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er of I@@ c@@ el@@ and has re@@ sig@@ ned .
We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the b@@ ru@@ tal S@@ y@@ ri@@ an di@@ c@@ tat@@ or B@@ ash@@ ar Al@@ -@@ A@@ s@@ sa@@ d has also got off@@ sh@@ ore companies .
"There &apos;s been al@@ leg@@ ations of a $ 2 billion money tra@@ il that lea@@ ds back to P@@ re@@ sid@@ ent V@@ lad@@ im@@ ir P@@ ut@@ in of R@@ us@@ si@@ a vi@@ a his close chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od friend , who happens to be a top c@@ el@@ li@@ st ."
And there will be a lot of ri@@ ch individu@@ als out there and others who will be ner@@ v@@ ous about the next set of stories and the next set of le@@ ak@@ ed do@@ cu@@ ments .
"Now , this s@@ oun@@ ds like the pl@@ ot of a sp@@ y th@@ r@@ ill@@ er or a J@@ oh@@ n G@@ ri@@ sh@@ am nov@@ el ."
"It se@@ ems very dist@@ ant from you , me , ordin@@ ary people ."
Why should we care about this ?
"But the tru@@ th is that if ri@@ ch and powerful individu@@ als are able to keep their money off@@ sh@@ ore and not p@@ ay the ta@@ x@@ es that they should , it means that there is less money for v@@ ital public ser@@ vi@@ ces like heal@@ th@@ care , education , ro@@ ads ."
And that aff@@ ec@@ ts all of us .
"Now , for my organiz@@ ation G@@ l@@ ob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this ex@@ pos@@ é has been ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al ."
We have the world &apos;s medi@@ a and polit@@ ical lea@@ ders talking about how individu@@ als can use off@@ sh@@ ore se@@ cre@@ cy to hi@@ de and dis@@ gu@@ ise their as@@ s@@ ets — something we have been talking about and ex@@ pos@@ ing for a de@@ ca@@ de .
"Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world ba@@ ff@@ ling and conf@@ using , and hard to understand how this sort of off@@ sh@@ ore world works ."
I like to think of it a bit like a R@@ us@@ si@@ an dol@@ l .
"So you can have one company st@@ ac@@ ked inside another company , st@@ ac@@ ked inside another company , making it almost im@@ possible to really understand who is behind these struc@@ tures ."
"It can be very difficult for la@@ w en@@ for@@ c@@ ement or ta@@ x au@@ th@@ or@@ ities , jour@@ nal@@ ist@@ s , ci@@ vil society to really understand what &apos;s going on ."
I also think it &apos;s interesting that there &apos;s been less c@@ over@@ age of this issue in the United States .
"And that &apos;s perhaps because some pro@@ min@@ ent U@@ S people just hav@@ en &apos;t fi@@ gu@@ red in this ex@@ pos@@ é , in this sc@@ an@@ d@@ al ."
"Now , that &apos;s not because there are no ri@@ ch Americ@@ ans who are sta@@ sh@@ ing their as@@ s@@ ets off@@ sh@@ ore ."
"It &apos;s just because of the way in which off@@ sh@@ ore works , M@@ os@@ s@@ ack F@@ on@@ se@@ ca has fe@@ wer American c@@ li@@ ents ."
"I think if we saw le@@ ak@@ s from the C@@ a@@ y@@ man I@@ sl@@ an@@ ds or even from D@@ el@@ aw@@ are or W@@ y@@ om@@ ing or Ne@@ va@@ da , you would see many more c@@ ases and exam@@ ples lin@@ king back to Americ@@ ans ."
"In fact , in a number of U@@ S stat@@ es you need less information , you need to pro@@ vide less information to get a company than you do to get a li@@ bra@@ ry c@@ ard ."
That sort of se@@ cre@@ cy in America has allo@@ wed em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es of school di@@ stri@@ c@@ ts to ri@@ p off scho@@ ol@@ children .
It has allo@@ wed sc@@ am@@ mer@@ s to ri@@ p off v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able invest@@ ors .
This is the sort of behavi@@ or that aff@@ ec@@ ts all of us .
"Now , at G@@ l@@ ob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in pra@@ cti@@ ce ."
How does this actually work ?
So what we did is we s@@ ent in an under@@ c@@ over invest@@ ig@@ ator to 1@@ 3 M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ t@@ an la@@ w fi@@ r@@ ms .
"O@@ ur invest@@ ig@@ ator posed as an Afri@@ can min@@ ist@@ er who wanted to move su@@ spe@@ ct fun@@ ds into the United States to bu@@ y a house , a y@@ ach@@ t , a j@@ et ."
"Now , what was tru@@ ly sho@@ c@@ king was that all but one of those la@@ w@@ y@@ ers pro@@ vid@@ ed our invest@@ ig@@ ator with su@@ gg@@ esti@@ ons on how to move those su@@ spe@@ ct fun@@ ds ."
It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individu@@ al c@@ ases .
This is not just about an individu@@ al la@@ w@@ y@@ er who &apos;s spo@@ k@@ en to our under@@ c@@ over invest@@ ig@@ ator and pro@@ vid@@ ed su@@ gg@@ esti@@ ons .
It &apos;s not just about a particular s@@ eni@@ or polit@@ ici@@ an who &apos;s been cau@@ ght up in a sc@@ an@@ d@@ al .
"And in order to ta@@ ck@@ le this , we need to change the game ."
"But as a natural op@@ tim@@ ist , I do see that we are star@@ ting to get some change ."
"O@@ ver the last couple of years , we &apos;ve seen a real pus@@ h to@@ wards gre@@ ater tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy when it comes to company ow@@ ner@@ ship ."

"So we &apos;d really want to see the P@@ an@@ am@@ a le@@ ak@@ s , this huge pe@@ ek into the off@@ sh@@ ore world , be used as a way of op@@ ening up in the U@@ S and around the world ."
"For us at G@@ l@@ ob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this is a moment for change ."
We need ordin@@ ary people to get ang@@ ry at the way in which people can hi@@ de their id@@ ent@@ ity behind se@@ cre@@ t companies .
"We need business lea@@ ders to stand up and say , &quot; S@@ ec@@ rec@@ y like this is not good for business . &quot;"
"We need polit@@ ical lea@@ ders to recogniz@@ e the problem , and to comm@@ it to chang@@ ing the la@@ w to open up this sort of se@@ cre@@ cy ."

C@@ an that pos@@ si@@ bly be true ?
"@@ Ju@@ li@@ an A@@ s@@ san@@ ge : Yeah , can it pos@@ si@@ bly be true ?"
It &apos;s a wor@@ ry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the re@@ st of the world &apos;s medi@@ a is doing such a bad job that a little group of ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts is able to re@@ le@@ ase more of that ty@@ pe of information than the re@@ st of the world pres@@ s com@@ b@@ ined .

"@@ J@@ A : So these are — as far as we can tell — clas@@ si@@ cal wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us ."

This is something you le@@ ak@@ ed a few years ago .

So this was a story in K@@ en@@ y@@ a a few years ago .
C@@ an you tell us what you le@@ ak@@ ed and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ ro@@ ll Re@@ port .
This was a se@@ cre@@ t intellig@@ ence re@@ port comm@@ is@@ sion@@ ed by the K@@ en@@ y@@ an government after its elec@@ tion in 200@@ 4 .
"P@@ ri@@ or to 200@@ 4 , K@@ en@@ y@@ a was ru@@ led by D@@ ani@@ el a@@ ra@@ p Mo@@ i for about 18 years ."
He was a so@@ ft di@@ c@@ tat@@ or of K@@ en@@ y@@ a .

"And then the government s@@ at on it and used it for polit@@ ical le@@ ver@@ age on Mo@@ i , who was the ri@@ ches@@ t man — still is the ri@@ ches@@ t man — in K@@ en@@ y@@ a ."
It &apos;s the H@@ ol@@ y G@@ ra@@ il of K@@ en@@ y@@ an jour@@ nal@@ ism .
"So I went there in 200@@ 7 , and we manag@@ ed to get h@@ old of this just pri@@ or to the elec@@ tion — the national elec@@ tion , D@@ ec@@ ember 2@@ 8 ."
"When we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed that re@@ port , we did so three days after the new pre@@ sid@@ ent , K@@ i@@ ba@@ ki , had decided to p@@ al up with the man that he was going to cle@@ an out , D@@ ani@@ el a@@ ra@@ p Mo@@ i , so this re@@ port then became a de@@ ad al@@ bat@@ ross around P@@ re@@ sid@@ ent K@@ i@@ ba@@ ki &apos;s ne@@ ck ."
"C@@ A : And — I mean , to c@@ ut a long story shor@@ t — word of the re@@ port le@@ ak@@ ed into K@@ en@@ y@@ a , not from the off@@ ici@@ al medi@@ a , but indi@@ rec@@ tly , and in your op@@ in@@ ion , it actually shi@@ f@@ ted the elec@@ tion ."
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . So this became front p@@ age of the G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an and was then prin@@ ted in all the sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding countries of K@@ en@@ y@@ a , in T@@ an@@ z@@ ani@@ an and S@@ outh Afri@@ can pres@@ s ."
And so it came in from the outside .
"And that , after a couple of days , made the K@@ en@@ y@@ an pres@@ s feel sa@@ fe to talk about it ."
"And it ran for 20 ni@@ ghts stra@@ ight on K@@ en@@ y@@ an T@@ V , shi@@ f@@ ted the v@@ ot@@ e by 10 percent , ac@@ cor@@ ding to a K@@ en@@ y@@ an intellig@@ ence re@@ port , which changed the resul@@ t of the elec@@ tion ."
"C@@ A : W@@ ow , so your le@@ ak really sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally changed the world ?"
J@@ A : Y@@ ep .
( Applause ) C@@ A : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a shor@@ t c@@ li@@ p from this B@@ a@@ gh@@ da@@ d air@@ stri@@ ke video .
"The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a shor@@ t c@@ li@@ p ."
"This is — this is in@@ ten@@ se material , I should war@@ n you ."
"R@@ a@@ di@@ o : ... just fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up ."
"I see your ele@@ ment , u@@ h , got about four H@@ um@@ ve@@ es , u@@ h , out along ..@@ ."
You &apos;re clear . All right . F@@ ir@@ ing .
Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s sho@@ ot .
L@@ ight &apos; em all up .
"@@ C &apos;@@ mon , fi@@ re !"
( M@@ ach@@ ine gu@@ n fi@@ re ) K@@ e@@ ep sho@@ ot &apos; n . K@@ e@@ ep sho@@ ot &apos; n . ( M@@ ach@@ ine gu@@ n fi@@ re ) K@@ e@@ ep sho@@ ot &apos; n .
"H@@ ot@@ el ... B@@ ush@@ ma@@ ster T@@ w@@ o-@@ S@@ i@@ x , B@@ ush@@ ma@@ ster T@@ w@@ o-@@ S@@ i@@ x ,"
"@@ we need to move , time now !"
"A@@ ll right , we just eng@@ ag@@ ed all e@@ ight individu@@ als ."
"@@ Yeah , we see two bir@@ ds &#91; hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters &#93; , and we &apos;re still fi@@ r@@ ing ."
R@@ og@@ er . I got &apos; em .
"T@@ w@@ o-@@ S@@ i@@ x , this is T@@ w@@ o-@@ S@@ i@@ x , we &apos;re mobil@@ e ."
"O@@ op@@ s , I &apos;m sor@@ ry . What was going on ?"
"G@@ od dam@@ n it , K@@ y@@ le . All right , ha@@ ha@@ ha . I h@@ it &apos; em ."
"C@@ A : So , what was the imp@@ act of that ?"
J@@ A : The imp@@ act on the people who worked on it was se@@ v@@ ere .
We en@@ ded up sen@@ ding two people to B@@ a@@ gh@@ da@@ d to f@@ ur@@ ther research that story .
So this is just the first of three atta@@ cks that oc@@ cur@@ red in that sc@@ en@@ e .
"C@@ A : So , I mean , 11 people di@@ ed in that atta@@ ck , right , inclu@@ ding two Re@@ u@@ ters em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . T@@ w@@ o Re@@ u@@ ters em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es , two young children were w@@ oun@@ ded ."
There were between 18 and 2@@ 6 people kill@@ ed all together .
C@@ A : And re@@ le@@ as@@ ing this cau@@ sed wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ou@@ tra@@ ge .
"What was the key ele@@ ment of this that actually cau@@ sed the ou@@ tra@@ ge , do you think ?"
J@@ A : I don &apos;t know . I gu@@ ess people can see the gro@@ s@@ s dis@@ par@@ ity in for@@ ce .
"You have guys wal@@ king in a re@@ la@@ x@@ ed way down the stre@@ et , and then an A@@ pa@@ ch@@ e hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter sit@@ ting up at one kilomet@@ er fi@@ r@@ ing 3@@ 0-@@ milli@@ met@@ er can@@ no@@ n sh@@ ell@@ s on everyone — looking for any exc@@ use to do so — and kill@@ ing people res@@ cu@@ ing the w@@ oun@@ ded ."
And there was two jour@@ nal@@ ist@@ s invol@@ ved that c@@ lear@@ ly wer@@ en &apos;t in@@ sur@@ g@@ ents because that &apos;s their ful@@ l@@ -@@ time job .
"C@@ A : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.@@ S. intellig@@ ence anal@@ y@@ st , B@@ ra@@ d@@ le@@ y M@@ an@@ ning , ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed , and it &apos;s al@@ leg@@ ed that he conf@@ ess@@ ed in a ch@@ at room to have le@@ ak@@ ed this video to you , along with 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 clas@@ si@@ fi@@ ed U.@@ S. em@@ bas@@ sy c@@ ab@@ les ."
"I mean , did he ?"
J@@ A : We have d@@ eni@@ ed rec@@ ei@@ ving those c@@ ab@@ les .
"He has been ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ed , about five days ago , with ob@@ tain@@ ing 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 c@@ ab@@ les and re@@ le@@ as@@ ing 50 ."
"Now , we had re@@ le@@ as@@ ed , early in the year , a c@@ able from the Re@@ y@@ k@@ ja@@ vi@@ k U.@@ S. em@@ bas@@ sy , but this is not ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily conne@@ cted ."
"I mean , I was a known vis@@ it@@ or of that em@@ bas@@ sy ."
"C@@ A : I mean , if you did rec@@ ei@@ ve thousands of U.@@ S. em@@ bas@@ sy di@@ pl@@ om@@ atic c@@ ab@@ les ..@@ ."
"@@ J@@ A : We would have re@@ le@@ as@@ ed them . ( C@@ A : You would ? ) J@@ A : Yeah . ( C@@ A : Because ? ) J@@ A : Well , because these sort of things re@@ ve@@ al what the true state of , say , A@@ ra@@ b govern@@ ments are like , the true hum@@ an@@ -@@ ri@@ ghts ab@@ us@@ es in those govern@@ ments ."
"If you look at de@@ clas@@ si@@ fi@@ ed c@@ ab@@ les , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there ."
C@@ A : So let &apos;s talk a little more bro@@ ad@@ ly about this .
"I mean , in gener@@ al , what &apos;s your ph@@ il@@ oso@@ ph@@ y ?"
Why is it right to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge lea@@ king of se@@ cre@@ t information ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achi@@ eve re@@ form ."
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
"So information that organiz@@ ations are sp@@ en@@ ding economic ef@@ for@@ t into conc@@ e@@ al@@ ing , that &apos;s a really good sig@@ nal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organiz@@ ations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are sp@@ en@@ ding work to conc@@ e@@ al it ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in pra@@ cti@@ ce , and that &apos;s what the history of jour@@ nal@@ ism is ."
"C@@ A : But are there ri@@ sk@@ s with that , ei@@ ther to the individu@@ als con@@ cer@@ ned or inde@@ ed to society at large , where lea@@ king can actually have an un@@ in@@ ten@@ ded con@@ sequ@@ ence ?"
J@@ A : N@@ ot that we have seen with anything we have re@@ le@@ as@@ ed .
"I mean , we have a har@@ m im@@ m@@ un@@ iz@@ ation po@@ lic@@ y ."
We have a way of de@@ al@@ ing with information that has sort of pers@@ onal — person@@ ally id@@ enti@@ f@@ ying information in it .
"But there are leg@@ it@@ im@@ ate se@@ cre@@ ts — you know , your recor@@ ds with your doc@@ tor ; that &apos;s a leg@@ it@@ im@@ ate se@@ cre@@ t — but we de@@ al with wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers that are coming for@@ ward that are really sort of w@@ ell@@ -@@ mot@@ iv@@ ated ."
C@@ A : So they are w@@ ell@@ -@@ mot@@ iv@@ ated .
"And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the par@@ ent of someone wh@@ ose son is out ser@@ ving the U.@@ S. mil@@ it@@ ary , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an in@@ c@@ enti@@ ve to put out ."
It shows a U.@@ S. sol@@ di@@ er l@@ augh@@ ing at people d@@ ying .
"That gi@@ ves the im@@ pres@@ sion , has given the im@@ pres@@ sion , to milli@@ ons of people around the world that U.@@ S. sol@@ di@@ ers are in@@ human people ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How d@@ are you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , we do get a lot of that ."
"But remember , the people in B@@ a@@ gh@@ da@@ d , the people in I@@ ra@@ q , the people in A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day ."
So it &apos;s not going to change their op@@ in@@ ion . It &apos;s not going to change their perc@@ ep@@ tion .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
"It will change the perc@@ ep@@ tion and op@@ in@@ ion of the people who are pa@@ ying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope ."
C@@ A : So you found a way to sh@@ ine light into what you see as these sort of dar@@ k se@@ cre@@ ts in companies and in government .
L@@ ight is good .
"But do you see any i@@ ro@@ ny in the fact that , in order for you to sh@@ ine that light , you have to , y@@ ourself , create se@@ cre@@ cy around your sour@@ ces ?"
"@@ J@@ A : N@@ ot really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any W@@ i@@ ki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s dis@@ sid@@ ents yet ."
We don &apos;t have sour@@ ces who are dis@@ sid@@ ents on other sour@@ ces .
"S@@ h@@ ould they come for@@ ward , that would be a tri@@ ck@@ y situ@@ ation for us , but we &apos;re pre@@ sum@@ ably ac@@ ting in such a way that people feel mor@@ ally comp@@ ell@@ ed to contin@@ ue our mis@@ sion , not to scre@@ w it up ."
"C@@ A : I &apos;d actually be interest@@ ed , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous as to the op@@ in@@ ion in the TED audi@@ ence ."
"You know , there might be a couple of vi@@ e@@ ws of W@@ i@@ ki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s and of Ju@@ li@@ an ."
"You know , her@@ o — people &apos;s her@@ o — br@@ ing@@ ing this important light ."
D@@ an@@ ger@@ ous t@@ rou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er .
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the her@@ o view ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the dan@@ ger@@ ous t@@ rou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er view ?
"@@ J@@ A : Oh , come on . There must be some ."
"C@@ A : It &apos;s a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d , Ju@@ li@@ an , a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
"Now here &apos;s something that you hav@@ en &apos;t yet le@@ ak@@ ed , but I think for TED you are ."
"I mean it &apos;s an in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?"
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a sam@@ ple of what we do sort of every day .
"So l@@ ate last year — in N@@ ov@@ ember last year — there was a seri@@ es of well blo@@ w@@ ou@@ ts in Al@@ b@@ ani@@ a , like the well blo@@ w@@ out in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , but not quite as big ."
"And we got a re@@ port — a sort of engine@@ ering anal@@ ys@@ is into what happened — saying that , in fact , se@@ cur@@ ity gu@@ ar@@ ds from some ri@@ val , vari@@ ous comp@@ et@@ ing oil fi@@ r@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked tru@@ cks there and blo@@ wn them up ."
"And part of the Al@@ b@@ ani@@ an government was in this , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
"And the engine@@ ering re@@ port had nothing on the top of it , so it was an ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely difficult do@@ cu@@ ment for us ."
We couldn &apos;t ver@@ i@@ fy it because we didn &apos;t know who w@@ ro@@ te it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of sk@@ ep@@ ti@@ cal that maybe it was a comp@@ et@@ ing oil fi@@ r@@ m just sort of pla@@ ying the issue up .
"So under that bas@@ is , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , we &apos;re sk@@ ep@@ ti@@ cal about this thing ."
"We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?"
"The material looks good , it feel@@ s right , but we just can &apos;t ver@@ i@@ fy it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a let@@ ter just this week from the company who w@@ ro@@ te it , wan@@ ting to tra@@ ck down the sour@@ ce — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , we want to tra@@ ck down the sour@@ ce . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more ."
"What do@@ cu@@ ment is it , pre@@ c@@ is@@ ely , you &apos;re talking about ?"
C@@ an you show that you had leg@@ al au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over that do@@ cu@@ ment ?
I@@ s it really y@@ ours ? &quot; &quot; So they s@@ ent us this scre@@ en sh@@ ot with the au@@ th@@ or in the M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft Wor@@ d I@@ D .
Yeah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
"This is like one of our me@@ th@@ od@@ s of id@@ enti@@ f@@ ying , of ver@@ i@@ f@@ ying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write let@@ ters ."
C@@ A : Yeah . H@@ ave you had information from inside B@@ P ?
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are under@@ going a sort of seri@@ ous fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing and engine@@ ering ef@@ for@@ t ."
So our publi@@ c@@ ation rate over the past few months has been sort of min@@ im@@ iz@@ ed while we &apos;re re@@ -@@ engine@@ ering our back systems for the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al public inter@@ est that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
"I mean , like any sort of gro@@ wing star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation , we are sort of over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting en@@ or@@ m@@ ous qu@@ an@@ t@@ ity of wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer dis@@ clo@@ su@@ res of a very high c@@ ali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and v@@ et this information ."
"C@@ A : So that &apos;s the key bot@@ t@@ len@@ ec@@ k , basically jour@@ nal@@ ist@@ ic vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and / or the fun@@ ding of jour@@ nal@@ ist@@ ic s@@ al@@ ari@@ es ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ ep . Yeah , and tru@@ st@@ ed people ."
"I mean , we &apos;re an organiz@@ ation that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we de@@ al with , so we have to re@@ structure in order to have people who will de@@ al with the high@@ est national se@@ cur@@ ity stuff , and then lo@@ wer se@@ cur@@ ity c@@ ases ."
C@@ A : So help us understand a bit about you person@@ ally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a ki@@ d you went to 3@@ 7 different scho@@ ols .
C@@ an that be right ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , my parents were in the mo@@ vie business and then on the run from a cul@@ t , so the com@@ bin@@ ation between the two ..@@ ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A : I mean , a p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ist might say that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ pe for bre@@ ed@@ ing par@@ an@@ o@@ ia ."
"@@ J@@ A : What , the mo@@ vie business ?"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) C@@ A : And you were also — I mean , you were also a h@@ ac@@ k@@ er at an early age and ran into the au@@ th@@ or@@ ities early on ."
"@@ J@@ A : Well , I was a jour@@ nal@@ ist ."
"You know , I was a very young jour@@ nal@@ ist activ@@ ist at an early age ."
"I w@@ ro@@ te a magaz@@ ine , was pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed for it when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er ."
So you have to be care@@ ful with h@@ ac@@ k@@ er .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a me@@ th@@ od that can be de@@ plo@@ yed for vari@@ ous things .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , at the moment , it &apos;s mo@@ st@@ ly de@@ plo@@ yed by the R@@ us@@ si@@ an ma@@ fi@@ a in order to ste@@ al your gran@@ d@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts ."
"So this ph@@ ra@@ se is not , not as ni@@ ce as it used to be ."
"C@@ A : Yeah , well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ al@@ ing any@@ one &apos;s gran@@ d@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t , but what about your cor@@ e val@@ ues ?"
C@@ an you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some in@@ ci@@ dent in your life that hel@@ ped det@@ er@@ m@@ ine them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure about the in@@ ci@@ dent .
"But the cor@@ e val@@ ues : well , cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s ; they n@@ ur@@ ture vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s ."
"And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men that have been in my life ."
"C@@ A : C@@ ap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s ; they n@@ ur@@ ture vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a com@@ b@@ ative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the n@@ ur@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s , which is to poli@@ ce per@@ p@@ et@@ rat@@ ors of cri@@ me ."
And so that is something that has been in my charac@@ ter for a long time .
"C@@ A : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minut@@ e , the story : what happened in I@@ c@@ el@@ and ?"
"You basically publi@@ shed something there , ran into t@@ rou@@ ble with a b@@ ank , then the news ser@@ vice there was in@@ ju@@ n@@ cted from ru@@ n@@ ning the story ."
"In@@ st@@ ead , they publi@@ c@@ iz@@ ed your side ."
That made you very high@@ -@@ prof@@ ile in I@@ c@@ el@@ and . What happened next ?
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , this is a great case , you know ."
I@@ c@@ el@@ and went through this finan@@ cial cri@@ s@@ is .
It was the har@@ d@@ est h@@ it of any country in the world .
I@@ ts ban@@ king sec@@ tor was 10 times the G@@ D@@ P of the re@@ st of the economy .
"A@@ ny@@ way , so we re@@ le@@ ase this re@@ port in Ju@@ ly last year ."
"And the national T@@ V st@@ ation was in@@ ju@@ n@@ cted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a mo@@ vie : in@@ ju@@ n@@ ction lan@@ ded on the news des@@ k , and the news read@@ er was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;"
"Well , we just show the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite instead , for all that time , as a f@@ ill@@ er , and we became very fam@@ ous in I@@ c@@ el@@ and , went to I@@ c@@ el@@ and and spo@@ ke about this issue ."
"And there was a feel@@ ing in the community that that should never happen again , and as a resul@@ t , working with I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c polit@@ ici@@ ans and some other inter@@ national leg@@ al ex@@ per@@ ts , we put together a new sort of p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ge of leg@@ isl@@ ation for I@@ c@@ el@@ and to sort of become an off@@ sh@@ ore hav@@ en for the free pres@@ s , with the stron@@ g@@ est jour@@ nal@@ ist@@ ic prote@@ ctions in the world , with a new N@@ ob@@ el Pri@@ ze for fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ ec@@ h ."
"I@@ c@@ el@@ and &apos;s a Nor@@ di@@ c country , so , like Nor@@ way , it &apos;s able to ta@@ p into the system ."
"And just a mon@@ th ago , this was pas@@ sed by the I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ am@@ ent un@@ anim@@ ously ."
C@@ A : W@@ ow .
"( Applause ) L@@ ast question , Ju@@ li@@ an ."
"When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more lik@@ ely to be Bi@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther ex@@ er@@ ting more control , more se@@ cre@@ cy , or us wat@@ ching Bi@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther , or it &apos;s just all to be pla@@ yed for ei@@ ther way ?"
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
"I mean , there &apos;s en@@ or@@ m@@ ous pres@@ su@@ res to har@@ mon@@ ize fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ ec@@ h leg@@ isl@@ ation and tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy leg@@ isl@@ ation around the world — within the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , between China and the United States ."
Wh@@ ich way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
"That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of ef@@ for@@ t , we can shi@@ ft it one way or the other ."
"C@@ A : Well , it looks like I &apos;m re@@ fle@@ c@@ ting the audi@@ ence &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion to say , Ju@@ li@@ an , be care@@ ful , and all power to you ."
"@@ J@@ A : Thank you , Ch@@ ris . ( C@@ A : Thank you . ) ( Applause )"
I feel incredi@@ bly lu@@ ck@@ y to be from a country that &apos;s gener@@ ally consi@@ der@@ ed to be the best place in the world to be a woman .
"In 19@@ 7@@ 5 , when I was se@@ ven years old , women in I@@ c@@ el@@ and went on a stri@@ ke ."
"They did no work that day , whether they hel@@ d profes@@ si@@ onal j@@ ob@@ s or had the work of the home ."
They mar@@ ched into the cent@@ er of Re@@ y@@ k@@ ja@@ v@@ í@@ k — 9@@ 0 percent of women parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated — and pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly and in sol@@ id@@ ar@@ ity asked for equ@@ ality .
"N@@ o@@ thing worked in I@@ c@@ el@@ and that day , because nothing works when women are not at work ."
"( Applause ) F@@ i@@ ve years later , I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ ders had the cou@@ ra@@ ge to be the first country in the world to demo@@ c@@ r@@ ati@@ cally elec@@ t a woman as their pre@@ sid@@ ent ."
"I will never for@@ get this day , that P@@ re@@ sid@@ ent V@@ ig@@ d@@ í@@ s , as we know her by her first name , ste@@ pped out on the bal@@ con@@ y of her own home , a single mom with her d@@ aughter by her side as she had won ."
"( Applause ) This woman was an incredi@@ ble ro@@ le model for me and everyone gro@@ wing up at that time , inclu@@ ding bo@@ ys ."
Wh@@ o am I to be pre@@ sid@@ ent ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less lik@@ ely to consi@@ der ru@@ n@@ ning than men .
"So a study done in the U@@ S in 20@@ 11 sho@@ wed that 6@@ 2 percent of men had consi@@ der@@ ed ru@@ n@@ ning for off@@ ice , but 4@@ 5 percent of women ."
"That &apos;s ga@@ p of 1@@ 6 perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge poin@@ ts , and it &apos;s the same ga@@ p that exist@@ ed a de@@ ca@@ de ear@@ li@@ er ."
"And it really is a sh@@ ame , because I am so con@@ vin@@ ced that the world is in real need for women lea@@ ders and more prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ e-@@ based lea@@ der@@ ship in gener@@ al ."
"So my deci@@ sion to run ul@@ tim@@ ately came down to the fact that I felt that I had to do my bit , even if I had no polit@@ ical experience , to step up and try to be part of cre@@ ating the world that will make sense and be su@@ sta@@ in@@ able for our kids , and a world where we tru@@ ly al@@ low both our bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls to be all they can be ."
And it was the jour@@ ney of my life .
It was amazing .
The jour@@ ney started with pot@@ enti@@ ally as many as 20 can@@ di@@ dat@@ es .
"It bo@@ il@@ ed down to n@@ ine can@@ di@@ dat@@ es qu@@ ali@@ f@@ ying , and ul@@ tim@@ ately the ra@@ ce came down to four of us , three men and me ."
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not all the dra@@ ma yet .
"You may think you have dra@@ ma in the U@@ S , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can as@@ sure you we had our own dra@@ ma in I@@ c@@ el@@ and ."
"So our sit@@ ting pre@@ sid@@ ent of 20 years an@@ no@@ un@@ ced in@@ iti@@ ally that he was not going to run , which is probably what gave ri@@ se to so many can@@ di@@ dat@@ es consi@@ der@@ ing ru@@ n@@ ning ."
Th@@ en later he changed his mind when our pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er re@@ sig@@ ned fol@@ lo@@ wing the in@@ fam@@ ous P@@ an@@ am@@ a P@@ a@@ per@@ s that imp@@ lic@@ ated him and his family .
"And there was a popul@@ ar pro@@ test in I@@ c@@ el@@ and , so the sit@@ ting pre@@ sid@@ ent thought they needed a tru@@ st@@ ed le@@ ad@@ er ."
"A few days later , rel@@ ations to his wi@@ fe and her family &apos;s companies were also discover@@ ed in the P@@ an@@ am@@ a P@@ a@@ per@@ s , and so he with@@ dre@@ w from the ra@@ ce again ."
"B@@ e@@ fore doing so , he said he was doing that because now there were two qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ed men who he felt could f@@ ill his sho@@ es ru@@ n@@ ning for off@@ ice ."
"So on M@@ ay 9 , 4@@ 5 days before elec@@ tion day , it was not looking too good for me ."
I did not even make the gra@@ ph in the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er .
"The pol@@ ls had me at 1 percent , but that was still the high@@ est that any woman an@@ no@@ un@@ cing her can@@ di@@ d@@ ac@@ y had ear@@ ned ."
"I found out on the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on of the first T@@ V de@@ b@@ ate that I would parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate along with the three men , and I found out on live T@@ V that I came in at exactly 2@@ .@@ 5 percent on the day of the first T@@ V de@@ b@@ ate ."
"( Applause ) So , chall@@ eng@@ es ."
"The fore@@ most chall@@ eng@@ es I had to face and over@@ come on this jour@@ ney had to do with medi@@ a , m@@ us@@ cle and money ."
Let &apos;s start with medi@@ a .
I can &apos;t say that I ag@@ ree .
It pro@@ ved har@@ der for me to both get acc@@ ess and air@@ time in medi@@ a .
"As a matter of fact , the le@@ ad@@ ing can@@ di@@ d@@ ate appe@@ a@@ red in bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast medi@@ a 8@@ 7 times in the months le@@ ad@@ ing up to the elec@@ tions , wh@@ ere@@ as I appe@@ a@@ red 3@@ 1 times ."
And I am not saying medi@@ a is doing this consci@@ ously .
"I think lar@@ g@@ ely this has to do with un@@ consci@@ ous bi@@ as , because in medi@@ a , much like every@@ where else , we have both consci@@ ous and un@@ consci@@ ous bi@@ as , and we need to have the cou@@ ra@@ ge to talk about it if we want to change it ."
"When I finally got acc@@ ess to T@@ V , the first question I got was , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you going to qu@@ it ? &quot; &quot; And that was a hard one ."
"But of course , with 1 percent to 2@@ .@@ 5 percent in the pol@@ ls , maybe it &apos;s under@@ stan@@ d@@ able ."
"But medi@@ a really mat@@ ters , and every time I appe@@ a@@ red on T@@ V , we saw and experi@@ en@@ ced a ri@@ se in the pol@@ ls , so I know fi@@ r@@ s@@ th@@ and how much this mat@@ ters and why we have to talk about it ."
I was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other can@@ di@@ dat@@ es and out of c@@ over@@ age about the elec@@ tions .
"So I did face this , but I will say this to comp@@ li@@ ment the I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c medi@@ a ."
I got few if any com@@ ments about my ha@@ ir and pan@@ t@@ su@@ it .
( Applause ) So ku@@ do@@ s to them .
But there is another experience that &apos;s very important .
"I ran as an inde@@ pen@@ dent can@@ di@@ d@@ ate , not with any polit@@ ical par@@ ty or m@@ us@@ cle behind me ."
"That l@@ ack of experience and l@@ ack of acc@@ ess to resour@@ ces probably came at a cost to our cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , but it also allo@@ wed us to innov@@ ate and do polit@@ ics differ@@ ently ."
"We ran a pos@@ itive cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , and we probably changed the t@@ one of the elec@@ tion for others by doing that ."
"It may be the reason why I had less air@@ time on T@@ V , because I wanted to show other con@@ ten@@ ders re@@ spe@@ ct ."
"When acc@@ ess to medi@@ a pro@@ ved to be so difficult , we ran our own medi@@ a ."
I ran live F@@ ace@@ book s@@ es@@ sions where I took questions from v@@ ot@@ ers on anything and respon@@ ded on the spo@@ t .
And we put all the questions I got and all the ans@@ wers on an open F@@ ace@@ book because we thought tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy is important if you want to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh tru@@ st .
"And when re@@ ach@@ ing young v@@ ot@@ ers pro@@ ved to be chall@@ eng@@ ing , I became a S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at@@ ter ."
"I got young people to te@@ ach me how to do that , and I used every fil@@ ter on S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at during the last part of the cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n ."
"And I actually had to use a lot of hu@@ mo@@ r and hum@@ il@@ ity , as I was very bad at it ."
But we gre@@ w the fol@@ lo@@ wing am@@ on@@ g@@ st young people by doing that .
So it &apos;s possible to run a different ty@@ pe of cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
"But un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , one can@@ not talk about polit@@ ics without men@@ tion@@ ing money ."
"I am sa@@ d that it is that way , but it &apos;s true , and we had less finan@@ cial resour@@ ces than the other can@@ di@@ dat@@ es ."
This probably was par@@ tly du@@ e to the fact that I think I had a har@@ der time as@@ king for finan@@ cial sup@@ port .
And maybe I also had the am@@ b@@ ition to do more with less .
S@@ ome would call that very wom@@ an@@ ly of me .
"But even with one third the medi@@ a , one third the finan@@ cial resour@@ ces , and only an ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ u@@ ri@@ al team , but an amazing team , we manag@@ ed to surpri@@ se everyone on elec@@ tion night , when the first num@@ bers came in ."
"I surpri@@ sed myself , as you may see in that p@@ ho@@ to ."
"( Laughter ) So the first num@@ bers , I came in ne@@ ck to ne@@ ck to the le@@ ad@@ ing can@@ di@@ d@@ ate ."
"( Ch@@ e@@ ers ) Well , too early , because I didn &apos;t quite pul@@ l that , but I came in second , and we went a long way from the one percent , with ne@@ arly a third of the v@@ ot@@ e , and we be@@ at the pol@@ ls by an un@@ pre@@ c@@ ed@@ ented mar@@ g@@ in , or 10 perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge poin@@ ts ab@@ ov@@ e what the last pol@@ l came in at ."
"S@@ ome people call me the real win@@ ner of the elec@@ tion because of this , and there are many people who en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed me to run again ."
"But what really makes me pro@@ u@@ d is to know that I ear@@ ned pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately high@@ er perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge sup@@ port from the young people , and a lot of people en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed my d@@ aughter to run in 20@@ 40 ."
"( Applause ) She is 1@@ 3 , and she had never been on T@@ V before ."
"And on elec@@ tion day , I ob@@ ser@@ ved her on T@@ V re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly , and she was sm@@ art , she was self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dent , she was sin@@ c@@ ere , and she was sup@@ por@@ tive of her mother ."
This was probably the high@@ light of my cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
A@@ udi@@ ence : A@@ w !
This picture was really enough of a w@@ in for me .
"What we see , we can be ."
So scre@@ w fe@@ ar and chall@@ eng@@ es .
"( Applause ) It mat@@ ters that women run , and it &apos;s time for women to run for off@@ ice , be it the off@@ ice of the C@@ E@@ O or the off@@ ice of the pre@@ sid@@ ent ."
"I also manag@@ ed to put an im@@ pres@@ sion on your very own &quot; &quot; New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er . &quot; &quot; I ear@@ ned a new t@@ it@@ le , &quot; &quot; A living e@@ mo@@ j@@ i of sin@@ cer@@ ity . &quot; &quot; ( Ch@@ e@@ ers ) It is pos@@ si@@ bly my pro@@ ud@@ est t@@ it@@ le yet , and the reason is that women too often get pen@@ aliz@@ ed for using what I call their emot@@ i@@ onal cap@@ ital , but I know from experience that we become so good when we do just that ."
( Applause ) And we need more of that .
"We c@@ ele@@ b@@ rat@@ ed as if we had won on elec@@ tion night , because that &apos;s how we felt ."
So you don &apos;t ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily have to re@@ ach that off@@ ice .
"You just have to go for it , and you , your family , your friends , everyone working with you , if you do it well , you will grow be@@ y@@ ond anything you will experience before ."
"So we had a good time , and I learned a lot on this jour@@ ney , probably more l@@ ess@@ ons than I can share here in the time we have today ."
"But re@@ st as@@ su@@ red , it was hard work ."
I lost a lot of sle@@ ep during those months .
"It took res@@ ili@@ ence and per@@ sever@@ ance to not qu@@ it , but I learned something that I knew before on the one percent day , and that is that you can only be good when you are tru@@ ly , au@@ th@@ enti@@ cally list@@ ening to your own vo@@ ice and working in al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment with that ."
"As a good sist@@ er of m@@ ine sometimes says , you may che@@ at on your in@@ tu@@ ition , but your in@@ tu@@ ition never che@@ ats on you ."
"I think it &apos;s also very important , and you all know this , that on any jour@@ ney you go on , it &apos;s the team you take along ."
"It &apos;s having people around you who share your val@@ ues , your vision , but are different in every other way ."
"That &apos;s the form@@ ul@@ a for succ@@ ess for me , and I am bl@@ ess@@ ed with an amazing h@@ us@@ b@@ and , here today , an incredi@@ ble family — ( Applause ) and great friends , and we came together as ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s in the polit@@ ical ar@@ ena , and pul@@ led something off that everyone said would be im@@ possible ."
"As a matter of fact , the le@@ ad@@ ing P@@ R ex@@ per@@ t told me before I made my deci@@ sion that I would do well to get se@@ ven percent ."
"I ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated his perspe@@ ctive , because he was probably right , and he was bas@@ ing it on val@@ u@@ able experience ."
"But on the one percent day , I decided here to show him that he was wrong ."
"It &apos;s very important to men@@ tion this , because I did lo@@ se a lot of sle@@ ep , and I worked hard , and so did the people with me ."
We can never go the di@@ stance if we for@@ get to take care of ourselves .
"And it &apos;s two things that I think are very important in that , in sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding y@@ ourself with people and pra@@ cti@@ ces that no@@ u@@ ri@@ sh you , but it &apos;s equ@@ ally important , maybe even more important , to have the cou@@ ra@@ ge to get ri@@ d of people and pra@@ cti@@ ces that take away your energy , inclu@@ ding the wonderful blo@@ gg@@ ers and com@@ men@@ tat@@ ors ."
"I took a lot of sup@@ port from others in doing this , and I made the deci@@ sion to go high when others went low , and that &apos;s par@@ tly how I k@@ ept my energy going throu@@ gh@@ out all of this ."
"And when I lost my energy for a moment — and I did from time to time , it wasn &apos;t easy — I went back to why I decided to run , and how I had decided to run my own ra@@ ce ."
"I called it a 4@@ G cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , the G &apos;s re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing the I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c words ."
"And the first one is called &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n . &quot; &quot; I ran to do good , to be of ser@@ vice , and I wanted ser@@ v@@ ant lea@@ der@@ ship to be at the cent@@ er of how I worked and everybody else in the cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n ."
"Se@@ con@@ d one is &quot; &quot; G@@ le@@ ð@@ i , &quot; &quot; or jo@@ y ."
I decided to en@@ jo@@ y the jour@@ ney .
And I tri@@ ed my ut@@ most to in@@ spi@@ re others to do so as well .
Th@@ ird is &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n@@ s@@ æ@@ i . &quot; &quot; I was open to any questions .
"I k@@ ept no se@@ cre@@ ts , and it was all open , on F@@ ace@@ book and we@@ b@@ sit@@ es ."
"Because I think if you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing your pre@@ sid@@ ent , you des@@ er@@ ve ans@@ wers to your questions ."
"L@@ ast but not least , I don &apos;t need to expla@@ in that in this room , we ran on the prin@@ ci@@ ple of G@@ ir@@ l@@ power ."
"( Ch@@ e@@ ers ) I am incredi@@ bly gla@@ d that I had the cou@@ ra@@ ge to run , to risk fa@@ il@@ ure but rec@@ ei@@ ve succ@@ ess on so many le@@ vel@@ s ."
"I can &apos;t tell you that it was easy , but I can tell you , and I think my entire team will ag@@ ree with me , that it was wor@@ th it ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
P@@ at M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell : I &apos;m not let@@ ting you go yet . H@@ all@@ a T@@ ó@@ mas@@ d@@ ó@@ t@@ ti@@ r : What a great c@@ ro@@ w@@ d . P@@ M : I can &apos;t let you go without saying
that probably everybody in the room is ready to move to I@@ c@@ el@@ and and v@@ ot@@ e for you .
"I mean , I &apos;m old enough to remember 19@@ 7@@ 5 when all the I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c women wal@@ ked out , and that really was a very big fac@@ tor in lau@@ n@@ ching the women &apos;s movement ."
You made a re@@ fer@@ ence to it ear@@ li@@ er . I &apos;d love to bring the picture back up and just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a stan@@ d@@ still .
"And then what you may not know because our American medi@@ a did not re@@ port it , the I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c women wal@@ ked out again on M@@ on@@ day . R@@ ight ?"
"H@@ T : Y@@ es , they did . P@@ M : C@@ an you tell us about that ?"
"H@@ T : Y@@ es , so 4@@ 1 years after the orig@@ in@@ al stri@@ ke , we may be the best place in the world to be a woman , but our work isn &apos;t done ."
"So at 2 : 3@@ 8@@ p@@ m on M@@ on@@ day , women in I@@ c@@ el@@ and left work , because that &apos;s when they had ear@@ ned their day &apos;s s@@ al@@ ary ."
"( Applause ) What &apos;s really co@@ ol about this is that young women and men parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated in gre@@ ater num@@ bers than before , because it is time that we close the p@@ ay ga@@ p ."
"P@@ M : So I &apos;m not going to ask H@@ all@@ a to comm@@ it right now to what she &apos;s doing next , but I will say that you &apos;d have a very large vol@@ un@@ te@@ er ar@@ my should you deci@@ de to do that again ."
Thank you H@@ all@@ a .
H@@ T : Thank you all .
( Applause )
"As a matter of fact , I was trying to think about my care@@ er since I left the Wh@@ ite H@@ ou@@ se , and the best example I have is a car@@ to@@ on in The New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er a couple of years ago ."
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , when I grow up , I want to be a form@@ er pre@@ sid@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great bl@@ ess@@ ing as a form@@ er pre@@ sid@@ ent , because I have had an acc@@ ess that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"N@@ ot only am I famili@@ ar with the 50 stat@@ es in the United States , but also my wi@@ fe and I have vis@@ ited more than 1@@ 4@@ 5 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ ent@@ er has had ful@@ l@@ -@@ time progra@@ ms in 80 n@@ ations on Earth ."
"And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the me@@ et the king or the pre@@ sid@@ ent , but we also me@@ et the v@@ ill@@ ag@@ ers who live in the most rem@@ ot@@ e are@@ as of Africa ."
"So our over@@ all comm@@ it@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ ent@@ er is to pro@@ mot@@ e human ri@@ ghts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equ@@ i@@ vo@@ c@@ ation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ ghts on Earth is , stran@@ g@@ ely , not add@@ res@@ sed quite often , is the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to beg@@ in with .
"F@@ i@@ rst of all is the mis@@ inter@@ pret@@ ation of religi@@ ous sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures , hol@@ y sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures , in the Bi@@ ble , O@@ ld T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , Q@@ u@@ ran and so for@@ th , and these have been mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ c@@ en@@ d@@ ant pos@@ itions in the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gu@@ es and the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es and in the mo@@ squ@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these ru@@ les to make sure that women are ordin@@ ar@@ ily re@@ leg@@ ated to a secon@@ d@@ ary pos@@ ition com@@ pa@@ red to men in the eyes of G@@ od .
This is a very seri@@ ous problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ ar@@ ily not add@@ res@@ sed .
"A number of years ago , in the year 20@@ 00 , I had been a B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist , a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist for 70 years — I tell you , I still te@@ ach S@@ un@@ day school every S@@ un@@ day ; I &apos;ll be teach@@ ing this S@@ un@@ day as well — but the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist Con@@ ven@@ tion in the year 20@@ 00 decided that women should play a secon@@ d@@ ary pos@@ ition , a sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent pos@@ ition to men ."
"So they issu@@ ed an e@@ di@@ ct , in eff@@ ect , that prev@@ ents women from being pri@@ est@@ s , pa@@ st@@ ors , de@@ ac@@ ons in the ch@@ ur@@ ch , or cha@@ pla@@ ins in the mil@@ it@@ ary , and if a woman teach@@ es a clas@@ s@@ room in a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist se@@ min@@ ary , they can@@ not te@@ ach if a bo@@ y is in the room , because you can find ver@@ ses in the Bi@@ ble , there &apos;s over 3@@ 0,000 ver@@ ses in the Bi@@ ble , that say that a woman sh@@ ouldn &apos;t te@@ ach a man , and so for@@ th ."
But the ba@@ sic thing is the sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures are mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ c@@ en@@ d@@ ant pos@@ ition .
"That is an all@@ -@@ per@@ va@@ sive problem , because men can ex@@ er@@ t that power and if an ab@@ u@@ sive h@@ us@@ b@@ and or an em@@ plo@@ y@@ er , for in@@ stance , wan@@ ts to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equ@@ al in the eyes of G@@ od , why should I tre@@ at them as equ@@ als myself ?"
Why should I p@@ ay them equ@@ al p@@ ay for doing the same kind of work ?
"The other very seri@@ ous bli@@ ght that cau@@ ses this problem is the exc@@ es@@ sive res@@ or@@ t to viol@@ ence , and that is incre@@ as@@ ing tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously around the world ."
"In the United States of America , for in@@ stance , we have had an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous incre@@ ase in ab@@ use of po@@ or people , mo@@ st@@ ly black people and min@@ or@@ ities , by put@@ ting them in pri@@ son ."
"When I was in off@@ ice as gov@@ er@@ no@@ r of G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans were in pri@@ son ."
"N@@ o@@ wa@@ days , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pri@@ son ."
That &apos;s a se@@ ven@@ f@@ old incre@@ ase .
"And since I left the Wh@@ ite H@@ ou@@ se , there &apos;s been an 8@@ 00 percent incre@@ ase in the number of women who are black who are in pri@@ son ."
We also have &#91; one of the only countries &#93; on Earth that still has the de@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty that is a develop@@ ed country .
And we ran@@ k right al@@ on@@ g@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ u@@ sive in all ele@@ ments of human ri@@ ghts in en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging the de@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty .
"We &apos;re in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a now , and I fi@@ gu@@ red out the other day that C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a has sp@@ ent four billion dollars in con@@ vi@@ c@@ ting 1@@ 3 people for the de@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty ."
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it co@@ sts C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a to sen@@ d a person to be ex@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed ."
"Ne@@ b@@ ras@@ ka this week just pas@@ sed a la@@ w ab@@ ol@@ ish@@ ing the de@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty , because it co@@ sts so much . ( Applause ) So the res@@ or@@ t to viol@@ ence and ab@@ use of po@@ or people and hel@@ pl@@ ess people is another c@@ ause of the incre@@ ase in ab@@ use of women ."
"L@@ et me just go down a very few ab@@ us@@ es of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fa@@ ir@@ ly bri@@ e@@ f , because I have a lim@@ ited amount of time , as you know ."
"G@@ en@@ ital mu@@ t@@ il@@ ation is hor@@ ri@@ ble and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a girl , very so@@ on in her life , her gen@@ it@@ als are completely c@@ ut away by a so@@ -@@ called c@@ ut@@ ter who has a raz@@ or bla@@ de and , in a no@@ n-@@ ster@@ iliz@@ ed way , they re@@ move the ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or parts of a woman &apos;s gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a ."
"And sometimes , in more ex@@ tre@@ me c@@ ases but not very ra@@ re c@@ ases , they se@@ w the ori@@ f@@ ice up so the girl can just ur@@ in@@ ate or men@@ stru@@ ate ."
"And then later , when she gets mar@@ ri@@ ed , the same c@@ ut@@ ter goes in and op@@ ens the ori@@ f@@ ice up so she can have se@@ x ."
"This is not a ra@@ re thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , for in@@ stance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the f@@ em@@ al@@ es that live in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt today have been se@@ x@@ u@@ ally mu@@ t@@ il@@ ated in that way ."
"In some countries , it &apos;s more than 9@@ 8 percent of the women are c@@ ut that way before they re@@ ach mat@@ ur@@ ity ."
This is a hor@@ ri@@ ble aff@@ lic@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
"A@@ no@@ ther very seri@@ ous thing is ho@@ no@@ r kill@@ ings , where a family with mis@@ inter@@ pret@@ ation , again , of a hol@@ y sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ture — there &apos;s nothing in the Q@@ u@@ ran that man@@ dat@@ es this — will ex@@ ec@@ ute a girl in their family if she is ra@@ ped or if she mar@@ ri@@ es a man that her father does not appro@@ ve , or sometimes even if she w@@ ear@@ s in@@ appro@@ pri@@ ate clo@@ thing ."
"And this is done by mem@@ bers of her own family , so the family be@@ comes m@@ ur@@ der@@ ers when the girl br@@ ings so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gra@@ ce to the family ."
"A@@ n anal@@ ys@@ is was done in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt not so long ago by the United N@@ ations and it sho@@ wed that 7@@ 5 percent of these m@@ ur@@ ders of a girl are per@@ p@@ et@@ rat@@ ed by the father , the un@@ cle or the bro@@ ther , but 25 percent of the m@@ ur@@ ders are con@@ duc@@ ted by women ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that rel@@ ates to women particul@@ arly is sl@@ av@@ ery , or human tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ wa@@ days ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people sol@@ d from Africa into sl@@ av@@ ery in the New Wor@@ ld back in the 19@@ th century and the 1@@ 8@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now living in sl@@ av@@ ery .
"The United States De@@ part@@ ment of S@@ t@@ ate now has a man@@ d@@ ate from Con@@ gres@@ s to give a re@@ port every year , and the S@@ t@@ ate De@@ part@@ ment re@@ por@@ ts that 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people are sol@@ d across inter@@ national bor@@ ders every year into sl@@ av@@ ery , and that 80 percent of those sol@@ d are women , into se@@ x@@ ual sl@@ av@@ ery ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are living in human b@@ on@@ da@@ ge , or sl@@ av@@ ery ."
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ ent@@ er is lo@@ c@@ ated and where I te@@ ach at E@@ mor@@ y Uni@@ vers@@ ity , they have between 2@@ 00 and 3@@ 00 women , people sol@@ d into sl@@ av@@ ery every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the n@@ ation because of that .
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta has the bu@@ si@@ est air@@ port in the world , and they also have a lot of pas@@ sen@@ g@@ ers that come from the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n H@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere ."
"If a bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner wan@@ ts to bu@@ y a girl that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ it@@ e-@@ sk@@ in@@ ned girl br@@ ings sever@@ al times more than that , and the aver@@ age bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per sl@@ ave ."
"The se@@ x tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , exc@@ e@@ ed@@ s the tot@@ al drug tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a ."
"So this is another very seri@@ ous problem , and the ba@@ sic problem is prost@@ it@@ ution , because there &apos;s not a wh@@ ore@@ house in America that &apos;s not known by the local off@@ ici@@ als , the local po@@ lic@@ em@@ en , or the chi@@ e@@ f of poli@@ ce or the ma@@ y@@ or and so for@@ th ."
"And this lea@@ ds to one of the wor@@ st problems , and that is that women are b@@ ou@@ ght incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly and put into se@@ x@@ ual sl@@ av@@ ery in all countries in the world ."
S@@ w@@ ed@@ en has got a good appro@@ ach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , S@@ w@@ ed@@ en decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed if they are in se@@ x@@ ual sl@@ av@@ ery , but the bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ n@@ ers and the p@@ im@@ ps and the mal@@ e cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed , and — ( Applause ) — prost@@ it@@ ution has gone down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite pos@@ ition ."
"For every mal@@ e ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed for il@@ leg@@ al se@@ x tra@@ de , 25 women are ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed in the United States of America ."
"C@@ an@@ a@@ da , I@@ rel@@ and , I &apos;ve already said S@@ w@@ ed@@ en , Fran@@ ce , and other countries are moving now to@@ wards this so@@ -@@ called S@@ w@@ ed@@ ish model ."
That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
We have two great instit@@ utions in this country that all of us ad@@ mire : our mil@@ it@@ ary and our great univers@@ ity system .
"In the mil@@ it@@ ary , they are now anal@@ y@@ z@@ ing how many se@@ x@@ ual as@@ s@@ au@@ l@@ ts take place ."
"The last re@@ port I got , there were 2@@ 6@@ ,000 se@@ x@@ ual as@@ s@@ au@@ l@@ ts that took place in the mil@@ it@@ ary — 2@@ 6@@ ,000 ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed , and the reason is that the com@@ man@@ ding off@@ ic@@ er of any organiz@@ ation — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a bat@@ tal@@ ion in the Ar@@ my or a company in the Mar@@ ines — the com@@ man@@ ding off@@ ic@@ er has the right under la@@ w to deci@@ de whether to pro@@ sec@@ ute a ra@@ pis@@ t or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their comm@@ and , se@@ x@@ ual as@@ s@@ au@@ l@@ ts are taking place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w needs to be changed .
"A@@ b@@ out one out of four gir@@ ls who ent@@ er American univers@@ ities will be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally as@@ s@@ au@@ l@@ ted before she gradu@@ ates , and this is now getting a lot of publi@@ city , parti@@ ally because of my book , but other things , and so 8@@ 9 univers@@ ities in America are now con@@ de@@ m@@ ned by the De@@ part@@ ment of E@@ duc@@ ation under T@@ it@@ le I@@ X because the off@@ ici@@ als of the univers@@ ities are not taking care of the women to prote@@ ct them from se@@ x@@ ual as@@ s@@ au@@ l@@ t ."
"The De@@ part@@ ment of Ju@@ st@@ ice says that more than half of the ra@@ p@@ es on a colle@@ ge cam@@ p@@ us take place by seri@@ al ra@@ p@@ ist@@ s , because outside of the univers@@ ity system , if they ra@@ pe somebody , they &apos;ll be pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed , but when they get on a univers@@ ity cam@@ p@@ us , they can ra@@ pe with imp@@ unity ."
They &apos;re not pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very seri@@ ous about the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls is the l@@ ack of equ@@ al p@@ ay for equ@@ al work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is sometimes mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted , but for ful@@ l@@ -@@ time em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I became pre@@ sid@@ ent , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
"So we &apos;ve made some progres@@ s , parti@@ ally because I was pre@@ sid@@ ent and so for@@ th — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no progres@@ s made , so it &apos;s been just about 2@@ 3 or 2@@ 4 percent difference for the last 15 years ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ or@@ tu@@ ne 500 companies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 500 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an aver@@ age than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like n@@ ation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the Se@@ con@@ d Wor@@ ld W@@ ar .
"S@@ omet@@ imes , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground fi@@ gh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been fl@@ ying over@@ head dro@@ pp@@ ing b@@ om@@ b@@ s on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have d@@ ron@@ es that atta@@ ck people and so for@@ th ."
We &apos;ve been at war with 25 different countries or more since the Se@@ con@@ d Wor@@ ld W@@ ar .
"There was four years , I won &apos;t say which ones , where we didn &apos;t — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t dro@@ p a b@@ om@@ b , we didn &apos;t lau@@ n@@ ch a mis@@ s@@ ile , we didn &apos;t fi@@ re a bu@@ l@@ let ."
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the res@@ or@@ t to viol@@ ence and the mis@@ inter@@ pret@@ ation of the hol@@ y sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures are what cau@@ ses , are the ba@@ sic cau@@ ses , of ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls ."
"There &apos;s one more ba@@ sic c@@ ause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a dam@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The aver@@ age man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls qui@@ et@@ ly acc@@ ep@@ ts the priv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed pos@@ ition that we oc@@ cu@@ py , and this is very si@@ mil@@ ar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ par@@ ate but equ@@ al had exist@@ ed ."
"R@@ ac@@ i@@ al dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation , leg@@ ally , had exist@@ ed for 100 years , from 1@@ 8@@ 6@@ 5 at the end of the W@@ ar B@@ et@@ ween the States , the C@@ i@@ vil W@@ ar , all the way up to the 19@@ 6@@ 0s , when L@@ y@@ n@@ don J@@ oh@@ n@@ son got the bil@@ ls pas@@ sed for equ@@ al ri@@ ghts ."
"But during that time , there were many white people that didn &apos;t think that ra@@ cial dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation was o@@ kay , but they sta@@ yed qui@@ et , because they en@@ jo@@ yed the priv@@ il@@ eg@@ es of better j@@ ob@@ s , uni@@ qu@@ e acc@@ ess to ju@@ ry du@@ ty , better scho@@ ols , and everything else , and that &apos;s the same thing that exist@@ s today , because the aver@@ age man really doesn &apos;t care ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation against gir@@ ls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ jo@@ y a priv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed pos@@ ition ."
"And it &apos;s very difficult to get the maj@@ or@@ ity of men who control the univers@@ ity system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the mil@@ it@@ ary system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the govern@@ ments of the world , and the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the great religi@@ ons ."
So what is the ba@@ sic thing that we need to do today ?
"I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful n@@ ations like this one , and where you come from , Euro@@ pe and so for@@ th , who have inf@@ lu@@ ence and who have fre@@ e@@ dom to speak and to act , need to take the respon@@ sibil@@ ity on y@@ ourselves to be more for@@ c@@ e@@ ful in de@@ man@@ ding an end to ra@@ cial dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation against gir@@ ls and women all over the world ."
The aver@@ age woman in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt doesn &apos;t have much to say about her d@@ augh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ t@@ il@@ ated and so for@@ th .
I didn &apos;t even go down to det@@ a@@ il about that .
"But I hope that out of this con@@ fer@@ ence , that every woman here will get your h@@ us@@ ban@@ ds to realiz@@ e that these ab@@ us@@ es on the colle@@ ge cam@@ pus@@ es and the mil@@ it@@ ary and so for@@ th and in the future job market , need to prote@@ ct your d@@ augh@@ ters and your gran@@ d@@ d@@ augh@@ ters ."
"I have 12 gran@@ d@@ children , four children , and 10 gre@@ at@@ -@@ gran@@ d@@ children , and I think often about them and about the p@@ light that they will face in America , not only if they li@@ ved in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt or a fore@@ ig@@ n country , in having equ@@ al ri@@ ghts , and I hope that all of you will jo@@ in me in being a ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on for women and gir@@ ls around the world and prote@@ ct their human ri@@ ghts ."
Thank you very much .

Li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an is up by 30 percent in my li@@ f@@ et@@ im@@ e .
Ch@@ il@@ d mor@@ tal@@ ity is down by tw@@ o-@@ th@@ ir@@ ds .
Per@@ -@@ cap@@ it@@ a food produc@@ tion is up by a third .
And all this at a time when the population has d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed .
"H@@ ow did we achi@@ eve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?"
How did we achi@@ eve that ?
How did we become the only species that be@@ comes more pros@@ per@@ ous as it be@@ comes more popul@@ ous ?
"The size of the blo@@ b in this gra@@ ph re@@ pres@@ ents the size of the population , and the level of the gra@@ ph re@@ pres@@ ents G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a ."
"I think to answer that question you need to understand how human be@@ ings bring together their bra@@ ins and en@@ able their ideas to com@@ b@@ ine and re@@ com@@ b@@ ine , to me@@ et and , inde@@ ed , to m@@ ate ."
"In other words , you need to understand how ideas have se@@ x ."
I want you to imagine how we got from making ob@@ jects like this to making ob@@ jects like this .
These are both real ob@@ jects .
One is an A@@ che@@ u@@ le@@ an hand a@@ x@@ e from half a million years ago of the kind made by H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s .
The other is obvi@@ ously a computer m@@ ou@@ se .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and sh@@ ape to an un@@ can@@ ny de@@ gre@@ e .
"I &apos;ve tri@@ ed to work out which is bi@@ g@@ ger , and it &apos;s almost im@@ possible ."
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both desig@@ ned to f@@ it the human hand .
"They &apos;re both tech@@ nologi@@ es . In the end , their si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ity is not that interesting ."
It just tel@@ ls you they were both desig@@ ned to f@@ it the human hand .
"The differ@@ ences are what inter@@ est me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty un@@ v@@ ar@@ ying design for about a million years — from on@@ e-@@ an@@ d-@@ a-@@ half million years ago to half a million years ago ."
"H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s made the same to@@ ol for 3@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations ."
"O@@ f course there were a few changes , but to@@ ols changed slo@@ wer than sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons in those days ."
"There was no progres@@ s , no innov@@ ation ."
"It &apos;s an extra@@ ordin@@ ary ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on , but it &apos;s true ."
Wh@@ ere@@ as the ob@@ ject on the right is ob@@ sol@@ ete after five years .
"And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the ob@@ ject on the left is made from one sub@@ stance ."
"The ob@@ ject on the right is made from a conf@@ ec@@ tion of different sub@@ stan@@ ces , from sil@@ ic@@ on and met@@ al and plast@@ ic and so on ."
"And more than that , it &apos;s a conf@@ ec@@ tion of different ideas , the idea of plast@@ ic , the idea of a l@@ as@@ er , the idea of tran@@ sist@@ ors ."
They &apos;ve all been com@@ b@@ ined together in this technology .
"And it &apos;s this com@@ bin@@ ation , this c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative technology , that in@@ tri@@ gu@@ es me , because I think it &apos;s the se@@ cre@@ t to under@@ standing what &apos;s happening in the world ."
"My body &apos;s an acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ation of ideas too : the idea of sk@@ in cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of li@@ ver cells ."
They &apos;ve come together .
"H@@ ow does evol@@ ution do c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative , com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al things ?"
"Well , it us@@ es se@@ x@@ ual re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"In an a@@ se@@ x@@ ual species , if you get two different mu@@ t@@ ations in different cre@@ at@@ ures , a gre@@ en one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other ."
One goes ex@@ tin@@ ct for the other to survi@@ ve .
"But if you have a se@@ x@@ ual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individu@@ al to in@@ her@@ it both mu@@ t@@ ations from different lin@@ e@@ ages ."
So what se@@ x does is it en@@ ab@@ les the individu@@ al to dra@@ w u@@ po@@ n the genet@@ ic innov@@ ations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not con@@ fin@@ ed to its own lin@@ e@@ age .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same eff@@ ect in cul@@ tu@@ ral evol@@ ution as se@@ x is having in biolog@@ ical evol@@ ution ?
"And I think the answer is ex@@ change , the h@@ ab@@ it of ex@@ chang@@ ing one thing for another ."
It &apos;s a uni@@ qu@@ e human fe@@ ature .
No other anim@@ al does it .
You can te@@ ach them in the laborat@@ ory to do a little bit of ex@@ change — and inde@@ ed there &apos;s re@@ ci@@ proc@@ ity in other animals — But the ex@@ change of one ob@@ ject for another never happens .
"As A@@ da@@ m S@@ m@@ ith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a do@@ g make a fa@@ ir ex@@ change of a b@@ one with another do@@ g . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without ex@@ change ."
"You can have , as it were , a@@ se@@ x@@ ual culture ."
"Ch@@ im@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ es , kill@@ er wh@@ al@@ es , these kinds of cre@@ at@@ ures , they have culture ."
They te@@ ach each other trad@@ itions which are han@@ ded down from par@@ ent to off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing .
"In this case , ch@@ im@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ es teach@@ ing each other how to cra@@ ck nu@@ ts with ro@@ cks ."
"But the difference is that these cul@@ tures never ex@@ p@@ and , never grow , never acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate , never become com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al , and the reason is because there is no se@@ x , as it were , there is no ex@@ change of ideas ."
Ch@@ im@@ pan@@ z@@ ee tro@@ op@@ s have different cul@@ tures in different tro@@ op@@ s .
There &apos;s no ex@@ change of ideas between them .
And why does ex@@ change ra@@ ise living stan@@ dar@@ ds ?
"Well , the answer came from Dav@@ id R@@ ic@@ ar@@ do in 1@@ 8@@ 1@@ 7 ."
"And here is a S@@ t@@ one A@@ ge ver@@ sion of his story , al@@ though he told it in terms of tra@@ de between countries ."
A@@ da@@ m takes four hours to make a spe@@ ar and three hours to make an a@@ x@@ e .
O@@ z takes one h@@ our to make a spe@@ ar and two hours to make an a@@ x@@ e .
So O@@ z is better at both spe@@ ar@@ s and a@@ x@@ es than A@@ da@@ m .
He doesn &apos;t need A@@ da@@ m .
He can make his own spe@@ ar@@ s and a@@ x@@ es .
"Well no , because if you think about it , if O@@ z makes two spe@@ ar@@ s and A@@ da@@ m make two a@@ x@@ es , and then they tra@@ de , then they will each have sav@@ ed an h@@ our of work ."
"And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better A@@ da@@ m is going to get at making a@@ x@@ es and the better O@@ z is going to get at making spe@@ ar@@ s ."
So the ga@@ ins from tra@@ de are only going to grow .
"And this is one of the beauti@@ es of ex@@ change , is it actually cre@@ ates the momen@@ tu@@ m for more speci@@ aliz@@ ation , which cre@@ ates the momen@@ tu@@ m for more ex@@ change and so on ."
A@@ da@@ m and O@@ z both sav@@ ed an h@@ our of time .
"That is pros@@ per@@ ity , the sav@@ ing of time in s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ ying your needs ."
A@@ s@@ k y@@ ourself how long you would have to work to pro@@ vide for y@@ ourself an h@@ our of read@@ ing light this ev@@ ening to read a book by .
"If you had to start from sc@@ rat@@ ch , let &apos;s say you go out into the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
You find a she@@ ep . You k@@ ill it . You get the f@@ at out of it .
"You ren@@ der it down . You make a can@@ dle , et@@ c@@ . et@@ c ."
How long is it going to take you ? Q@@ u@@ ite a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to ear@@ n an h@@ our of read@@ ing light if you &apos;re on the aver@@ age w@@ age in B@@ rit@@ a@@ in today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
"B@@ ack in 19@@ 50 , you would have had to work for e@@ ight secon@@ ds on the aver@@ age w@@ age to ac@@ qui@@ re that much light ."
"And that &apos;s se@@ ven and a half secon@@ ds of pros@@ per@@ ity that you &apos;ve ga@@ ined since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s se@@ ven and a half secon@@ ds in which you can do something else , or you can ac@@ qui@@ re another good or ser@@ vice ."
"And back in 1@@ 8@@ 80 , it would have been 15 minutes to ear@@ n that amount of light on the aver@@ age w@@ age ."
"B@@ ack in 1@@ 8@@ 00 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to ear@@ n a can@@ dle that could bur@@ n for an h@@ our ."
"In other words , the aver@@ age person on the aver@@ age w@@ age could not af@@ for@@ d a can@@ dle in 1@@ 8@@ 00 ."
"G@@ o back to this image of the a@@ x@@ e and the m@@ ou@@ se , and ask y@@ ourself : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The st@@ one a@@ x@@ e was made by someone for him@@ self ."
It was self-@@ su@@ ff@@ ici@@ en@@ cy .
We call that pover@@ ty these days .
But the ob@@ ject on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
T@@ ens ? H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds ? Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds ?
"You know , I think it &apos;s probably milli@@ ons ."
"Because you &apos;ve got to inclu@@ de the man who gre@@ w the co@@ ff@@ ee , which was bre@@ wed for the man who was on the oil ri@@ g , who was d@@ r@@ ill@@ ing for oil , which was going to be made into the plast@@ ic , et@@ c ."
"They were all working for me , to make a m@@ ou@@ se for me ."
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achi@@ ev@@ ed as a species .
"In the old days , if you were ri@@ ch , you liter@@ ally had people working for you ."
That &apos;s how you got to be ri@@ ch ; you em@@ plo@@ yed them .
L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V had a lot of people working for him .
"They made his sil@@ ly out@@ f@@ its , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his sil@@ ly ha@@ ir@@ st@@ y@@ les , or what@@ ever ."
He had 4@@ 9@@ 8 people to pre@@ p@@ are his din@@ ner every night .
"But a mo@@ der@@ n tou@@ ri@@ st going around the pal@@ ace of V@@ er@@ sa@@ ill@@ es and looking at L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V &apos;s pic@@ tures , he has 4@@ 9@@ 8 people doing his din@@ ner ton@@ ight too ."
"They &apos;re in bi@@ stro@@ s and c@@ af@@ es and re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts and sh@@ op@@ s all over Par@@ is , and they &apos;re all ready to ser@@ ve you at an h@@ our &apos;s not@@ ice with an exc@@ ell@@ ent me@@ al that &apos;s probably got high@@ er qu@@ ality than L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V even had ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other ."
We &apos;re able to dra@@ w u@@ po@@ n speci@@ aliz@@ ation and ex@@ change to ra@@ ise each other &apos;s living stan@@ dar@@ ds .
"Now , you do get other animals working for each other too ."
An@@ ts are a clas@@ sic example ; work@@ ers work for qu@@ e@@ ens and qu@@ e@@ ens work for work@@ ers .
"But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the col@@ ony ."
There &apos;s no working for each other across the col@@ on@@ ies .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a re@@ produc@@ tive di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
"That is to say , they speci@@ aliz@@ e with re@@ spe@@ ct to re@@ produc@@ tion ."
The qu@@ e@@ en does it all .
"In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that ."
"It &apos;s the one thing we in@@ si@@ st on doing for ourselves , is re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven in En@@ gl@@ and , we don &apos;t leave re@@ produc@@ tion to the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en ."
( Applause ) So when did this h@@ ab@@ it start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think , probably , the ol@@ d@@ est ver@@ sion of this is probably the se@@ x@@ ual di@@ vision of lab@@ or ."
But I &apos;ve got no evid@@ ence for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work mal@@ e for f@@ em@@ ale and f@@ em@@ ale for mal@@ e .
"In all hun@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ er soci@@ et@@ ies today , there &apos;s a for@@ ag@@ ing di@@ vision of lab@@ or between , on the whole , hun@@ ting mal@@ es and ga@@ ther@@ ing f@@ em@@ al@@ es ."
"It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a dist@@ in@@ ction between speci@@ aliz@@ ed ro@@ les for mal@@ es and f@@ em@@ al@@ es ."
And the beau@@ ty of this system is that it ben@@ ef@@ its both sid@@ es .
"The woman kno@@ ws that , in the H@@ ad@@ z@@ as &apos; case here — di@@ gg@@ ing ro@@ ots to share with men in ex@@ change for me@@ at — she kno@@ ws that all she has to do to get acc@@ ess to prote@@ in is to di@@ g some ex@@ tr@@ a ro@@ ots and tra@@ de them for me@@ at ."
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ ing hun@@ t and try and k@@ ill a war@@ th@@ o@@ g .
And the man kno@@ ws that he doesn &apos;t have to do any di@@ gg@@ ing to get ro@@ ots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he kill@@ s a war@@ th@@ o@@ g it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both sid@@ es ra@@ ise each other &apos;s stan@@ dar@@ ds of living through the se@@ x@@ ual di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
"When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do this ."
They were a high@@ ly co@@ oper@@ ative species .
They were a high@@ ly intellig@@ ent species .
"Th@@ e@@ ir bra@@ ins on aver@@ age , by the end , were bi@@ g@@ ger than y@@ ours and m@@ ine in this room today ."
They were imag@@ in@@ ative . They bu@@ ri@@ ed their de@@ ad .
"They had language , probably , because we know they had the F@@ O@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gen@@ e of the same kind as us , which was discover@@ ed here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d ."
And so it looks like they probably had lin@@ gu@@ ist@@ ic sk@@ ill@@ s .
They were br@@ illi@@ ant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als .
But there &apos;s no evid@@ ence of a se@@ x@@ ual di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
There &apos;s no evid@@ ence of ga@@ ther@@ ing behavi@@ or by f@@ em@@ al@@ es .
It looks like the f@@ em@@ al@@ es were co@@ oper@@ ative hun@@ ters with the men .
"And the other thing there &apos;s no evid@@ ence for is ex@@ change between grou@@ ps , because the ob@@ jects that you find in Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al re@@ ma@@ ins , the to@@ ols they made , are always made from local materi@@ als ."
"For example , in the C@@ au@@ c@@ as@@ us there &apos;s a s@@ ite where you find local Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al to@@ ols ."
They &apos;re always made from local cher@@ t .
"In the same val@@ le@@ y there are mo@@ der@@ n human re@@ ma@@ ins from about the same d@@ ate , 3@@ 0,000 years ago , and some of those are from local cher@@ t , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ si@@ di@@ an from a long way away ."
"And when human be@@ ings beg@@ an moving ob@@ jects around like this , it was evid@@ ence that they were ex@@ chang@@ ing between grou@@ ps ."
T@@ ra@@ de is 10 times as old as far@@ ming .
P@@ eople for@@ get that . P@@ eople think of tra@@ de as a mo@@ der@@ n thing .
E@@ x@@ change between grou@@ ps has been going on for a hun@@ d@@ red thou@@ s@@ and years .
"And the ear@@ li@@ est evid@@ ence for it c@@ ro@@ ps up some@@ where between 80 and 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ago in Africa , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and ja@@ sp@@ er and other things moving long di@@ stan@@ ces in E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia ."
You also see se@@ ash@@ ell@@ s — as discover@@ ed by a team here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d — moving 1@@ 25 mil@@ es in@@ land from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ ean in Al@@ g@@ eri@@ a .
And that &apos;s evid@@ ence that people have started ex@@ chang@@ ing between grou@@ ps .
And that will have led to speci@@ aliz@@ ation .
How do you know that lon@@ g@@ -@@ di@@ stance movement means tra@@ de rather than mi@@ gr@@ ation ?
"Well , you look at mo@@ der@@ n hun@@ ter ga@@ ther@@ ers like ab@@ orig@@ in@@ als , who qu@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed for st@@ one a@@ x@@ es at a place called M@@ oun@@ t I@@ sa , which was a qu@@ ar@@ ry ow@@ ned by the K@@ al@@ ka@@ do@@ on tri@@ be ."
"They tra@@ ded them with their ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s for things like st@@ in@@ gra@@ y bar@@ b@@ s , and the con@@ sequ@@ ence was that st@@ one a@@ x@@ es en@@ ded up over a large part of A@@ u@@ str@@ ali@@ a ."
"So lon@@ g@@ -@@ di@@ stance movement of to@@ ols is a sig@@ n of tra@@ de , not mi@@ gr@@ ation ."
"What happens when you c@@ ut people off from ex@@ change , from the ability to ex@@ change and speci@@ aliz@@ e ?"
"And the answer is that not only do you s@@ low down technolo@@ g@@ ical progres@@ s , you can actually th@@ row it into re@@ ver@@ se ."
A@@ n example is T@@ as@@ m@@ ani@@ a .
"When the se@@ a level ro@@ se and T@@ as@@ m@@ ani@@ a became an isl@@ and 1@@ 0,000 years ago , the people on it not only experi@@ en@@ ced slo@@ wer progres@@ s than people on the ma@@ in@@ land , they actually experi@@ en@@ ced re@@ gres@@ s ."
"They gave up the ability to make st@@ one to@@ ols and fi@@ sh@@ ing equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment and clo@@ thing because the population of about 4@@ ,000 people was simply not large enough to ma@@ in@@ tain the speci@@ aliz@@ ed sk@@ ill@@ s ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ary to keep the technology they had ."
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a des@@ er@@ t isl@@ and .
"H@@ ow many of the things in our po@@ ck@@ ets could we contin@@ ue to make after 1@@ 0,000 years ?"
"It didn &apos;t happen in T@@ i@@ er@@ ra del F@@ u@@ ego — si@@ mil@@ ar isl@@ and , si@@ mil@@ ar people ."
"The reason : because T@@ i@@ er@@ ra del F@@ u@@ ego is se@@ par@@ ated from S@@ outh America by a much nar@@ ro@@ wer stra@@ ight , and there was tra@@ ding con@@ ta@@ ct across that stra@@ ight throu@@ gh@@ out 1@@ 0,000 years ."
The T@@ as@@ m@@ ani@@ ans were is@@ ol@@ ated .
"G@@ o back to this image again and ask y@@ ourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it ."
"In the case of the st@@ one a@@ x@@ e , the man who made it knew how to make it ."
But who kno@@ ws how to make a computer m@@ ou@@ se ?
"N@@ ob@@ ody , liter@@ ally no@@ body ."
There is no@@ body on the planet who kno@@ ws how to make a computer m@@ ou@@ se .
I mean this quite seri@@ ously .
The pre@@ sid@@ ent of the computer m@@ ou@@ se company doesn &apos;t know .
He just kno@@ ws how to run a company .
"The person on the as@@ sem@@ bly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to d@@ r@@ ill an oil well to get oil out to make plast@@ ic , and so on ."
"We all know little b@@ its , but no@@ ne of us kno@@ ws the whole ."
"I am of course quot@@ ing from a fam@@ ous es@@ say by Le@@ on@@ ard R@@ ead , the econo@@ m@@ ist in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , called &quot; &quot; I , P@@ en@@ ci@@ l &quot; &quot; in which he w@@ ro@@ te about how a pen@@ ci@@ l came to be made , and how no@@ body kno@@ ws even how to make a pen@@ ci@@ l , because the people who as@@ sem@@ ble it don &apos;t know how to m@@ ine gra@@ ph@@ ite , and they don &apos;t know how to f@@ ell tre@@ es and that kind of thing ."
"And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through ex@@ change and speci@@ aliz@@ ation , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand ."
It &apos;s not the same with language .
W@@ ith language we have to trans@@ f@@ er ideas that we understand with each other .
"But with technology , we can actually do things that are be@@ y@@ ond our cap@@ abil@@ ities ."
We &apos;ve gone be@@ y@@ ond the cap@@ ac@@ ity of the human mind to an extra@@ ordin@@ ary de@@ gre@@ e .
"And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons that I &apos;m not interest@@ ed in the de@@ b@@ ate about I@@ .@@ Q@@ . , about whether some grou@@ ps have high@@ er I@@ .@@ Q@@ .@@ s than other grou@@ ps ."
It &apos;s completely ir@@ re@@ lev@@ ant .
"What &apos;s re@@ lev@@ ant to a society is how well people are communic@@ ating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re co@@ oper@@ ating , not how cle@@ ver the individu@@ als are ."
So we &apos;ve created something called the colle@@ ctive brain .
We &apos;re just the no@@ des in the net@@ work .
We &apos;re the neu@@ ron@@ s in this brain .
"It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the me@@ et@@ ing and mat@@ ing of ideas between them , that is cau@@ sing technolo@@ g@@ ical progres@@ s , incre@@ men@@ t@@ ally , bit by bit ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , bad things happen ."
"And in the future , as we go for@@ ward , we will , of course , experience ter@@ ri@@ ble things ."
There will be war@@ s ; there will be depres@@ sions ; there will be natural dis@@ ast@@ ers .
"A@@ w@@ ful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absol@@ ut@@ ely sure ."
"But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the conne@@ ctions people are making , and the ability of ideas to me@@ et and to m@@ ate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will adv@@ ance , and th@@ ere@@ fore living stan@@ dar@@ ds will adv@@ ance ."
"Because through the cl@@ ou@@ d , through c@@ ro@@ w@@ d sour@@ cing , through the bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the el@@ it@@ es but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them me@@ et and m@@ ate , we are su@@ rely acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating the rate of innov@@ ation ."

And it took 18 months .
"A lot of fu@@ n , ne@@ got@@ i@@ ations and stories , I can tell you , with 1@@ 7 very interesting mu@@ se@@ um@@ s from n@@ ine countries ."
But I &apos;m going to foc@@ us on the de@@ mo .
There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
"I think my pers@@ onal story is expla@@ ined very simply on the sli@@ de , and it &apos;s acc@@ ess ."
And I gre@@ w up in India .
I had a great education — I &apos;m not com@@ pla@@ ining — but I didn &apos;t have acc@@ ess to a lot of these mu@@ se@@ um@@ s and these art@@ works .
"And so when I started trav@@ el@@ ing and going to these mu@@ se@@ um@@ s , I started learning a lot ."
"And while working at Google , I tri@@ ed to put this des@@ i@@ re to make it more acc@@ es@@ sible with technology together ."
"So we form@@ ed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this ."
I &apos;m going to probably get into the de@@ mo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since lau@@ n@@ ch .

I see this pl@@ us sig@@ n .

And I get a lot of people as@@ king me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
You can z@@ o@@ om around very simply .
You see some fu@@ n stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his ex@@ pres@@ sion is pri@@ c@@ el@@ ess .

"And so I started pla@@ ying around , and I found something going on over here ."

"This is &quot; &quot; The S@@ tar@@ ry N@@ ight , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before ."
I &apos;m going to show you my other fav@@ or@@ ite fe@@ ature .
"There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time ."
This is the real co@@ ol part . It &apos;s called C@@ ol@@ le@@ ctions .
"A@@ ny one of you , any@@ body — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re ri@@ ch , if you &apos;re po@@ or , if you have a f@@ an@@ cy house — doesn &apos;t matter ."
You can go and create your own mu@@ se@@ um on@@ line — create your own colle@@ ction across all these images .

"It doesn &apos;t , in my op@@ in@@ ion , even come from the mu@@ se@@ um@@ s ."
I probably sh@@ ouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these arti@@ sts .
And that &apos;s been my hum@@ bl@@ ing experience in this .
"I mean , I hope in this dig@@ ital medi@@ um that we do ju@@ st@@ ice to their art@@ work and re@@ present it pro@@ per@@ ly on@@ line ."
"And the bi@@ gg@@ est question I get asked no@@ wa@@ days is , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you do this to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate the experience of going to a mu@@ se@@ um ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no ."
It &apos;s to sup@@ pl@@ ement the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ er .
"That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , writ@@ ing nov@@ els — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of stor@@ y@@ telling and also some super@@ natural cre@@ at@@ ures called the d@@ j@@ in@@ ni ."
"But before I go there , ple@@ ase al@@ low me to share with you g@@ lim@@ p@@ ses of my pers@@ onal story ."
"I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a ge@@ omet@@ ri@@ cal sh@@ ape , the cir@@ cle , so throu@@ gh@@ out my talk , you will come across sever@@ al cir@@ cl@@ es ."
"I was born in S@@ t@@ ras@@ b@@ our@@ g , Fran@@ ce to T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish parents ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , my parents got se@@ par@@ ated , and I came to T@@ ur@@ key with my mom ."
"F@@ rom then on , I was ra@@ is@@ ed as a single child by a single mother ."
"Now in the early 19@@ 7@@ 0s , in An@@ kar@@ a , that was a bit un@@ u@@ su@@ al ."
"O@@ ur ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od was full of large famili@@ es , where fa@@ thers were the he@@ ads of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , so I gre@@ w up seeing my mother as a di@@ vor@@ c@@ ee in a pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch@@ al environment ."
"In fact , I gre@@ w up ob@@ ser@@ ving two different kinds of wom@@ an@@ ho@@ od ."
"On the one hand was my mother , a w@@ ell@@ -@@ educ@@ ated , se@@ cul@@ ar , mo@@ der@@ n , w@@ est@@ ern@@ iz@@ ed , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman ."
"On the other hand was my gran@@ d@@ mother , who also took care of me and was more sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual , less educ@@ ated and de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely less r@@ ational ."
This was a woman who read co@@ ff@@ ee gro@@ un@@ ds to see the future and mel@@ ted le@@ ad into my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous sh@@ ap@@ es to f@@ end off the e@@ vil e@@ ye .
"M@@ any people vis@@ ited my gran@@ d@@ mother , people with se@@ v@@ ere ac@@ ne on their fac@@ es or war@@ ts on their hands ."
"E@@ ach time , my gran@@ d@@ mother would ut@@ ter some words in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c , take a red ap@@ ple and sta@@ b it with as many ro@@ se th@@ or@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to re@@ move ."
"Th@@ en one by one , she would en@@ cir@@ cle these th@@ or@@ ns with dar@@ k in@@ k ."
"A week later , the pati@@ ent would come back for a fol@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ up exam@@ in@@ ation ."
"Now , I &apos;m aw@@ are that I should not be saying such things in front of an audi@@ ence of sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s and scientists , but the tru@@ th is , of all the people who vis@@ ited my gran@@ d@@ mother for their sk@@ in cond@@ itions , I did not see any@@ one go back un@@ happy or un@@ heal@@ ed ."
I asked her how she did this . W@@ as it the power of pra@@ ying ?
"In respon@@ se she said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , pra@@ ying is effec@@ tive , but also be@@ w@@ are of the power of cir@@ cl@@ es . &quot; &quot; F@@ rom her , I learned , am@@ on@@ g@@ st many other things , one very pre@@ ci@@ ous les@@ son — that if you want to dest@@ ro@@ y something in this life , be it an ac@@ ne , a b@@ le@@ m@@ ish or the human s@@ ou@@ l , all you need to do is to sur@@ round it with th@@ ick w@@ all@@ s ."
It will d@@ ry up inside .
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cul@@ tu@@ ral cir@@ cle .
We all do .
"We &apos;re born into a certain family , n@@ ation , clas@@ s ."
"But if we have no conne@@ ction what@@ so@@ ever with the wor@@ l@@ ds be@@ y@@ ond the one we take for gran@@ ted , then we too run the risk of d@@ ry@@ ing up inside ."
"O@@ ur imag@@ in@@ ation might sh@@ rin@@ k ; our hear@@ ts might d@@ win@@ dle , and our hum@@ an@@ ness might wi@@ ther if we st@@ ay for too long inside our cul@@ tu@@ ral co@@ co@@ ons ."
"O@@ ur friends , ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s , colle@@ ag@@ ues , family — if all the people in our in@@ ner cir@@ cle re@@ sem@@ ble us , it means we are sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded with our mir@@ ro@@ r image ."
Now one other thing women like my gran@@ d@@ ma do in T@@ ur@@ key is to c@@ over mir@@ ro@@ r@@ s with vel@@ v@@ et or to han@@ g them on the w@@ all@@ s with their bac@@ ks fac@@ ing out .
It &apos;s an old E@@ ast@@ er@@ n trad@@ ition based on the knowled@@ ge that it &apos;s not heal@@ thy for a human being to spend too much time star@@ ing at his own re@@ fle@@ ction .
"I@@ ro@@ ni@@ cally , &#91; living in &#93; comm@@ unities of the lik@@ e-@@ min@@ ded is one of the gre@@ at@@ est dan@@ g@@ ers of today &apos;s glob@@ aliz@@ ed world ."
"And it &apos;s happening every@@ where , am@@ ong li@@ ber@@ als and con@@ ser@@ v@@ ati@@ ves , ag@@ nost@@ ics and beli@@ ever@@ s , the ri@@ ch and the po@@ or , E@@ ast and W@@ est ali@@ ke ."
"We t@@ end to form clu@@ st@@ ers based on si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ity , and then we produ@@ ce st@@ ere@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es about other clu@@ st@@ ers of people ."
"In my op@@ in@@ ion , one way of tran@@ sc@@ en@@ ding these cul@@ tu@@ ral gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is through the art of stor@@ y@@ telling ."
"S@@ t@@ ories can@@ not de@@ mol@@ ish fron@@ ti@@ ers , but they can p@@ un@@ ch hol@@ es in our mental w@@ all@@ s ."
"And through those hol@@ es , we can get a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of the other , and sometimes even like what we see ."
I started writ@@ ing fic@@ tion at the age of e@@ ight .
My mother came home one day with a tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise not@@ e@@ book and asked me if I &apos;d be interest@@ ed in ke@@ ep@@ ing a pers@@ onal jour@@ nal .
"In re@@ tro@@ spe@@ ct , I think she was sli@@ gh@@ tly wor@@ ri@@ ed about my san@@ ity ."
"I was con@@ stan@@ tly telling stories at home , which was good , exc@@ ept I told this to imag@@ in@@ ary friends around me , which was not so good ."
"I was an in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted child , to the point of communic@@ ating with col@@ o@@ red cra@@ y@@ ons and a@@ polo@@ g@@ iz@@ ing to ob@@ jects when I bu@@ mp@@ ed into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my da@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ day experi@@ ences and emot@@ i@@ ons ."
"What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was ter@@ ri@@ bly bor@@ ing , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself ."
"In@@ st@@ ead , I beg@@ an to write about people other than me and things that never really happened ."
And th@@ us beg@@ an my li@@ fe@@ -@@ long pas@@ sion for writ@@ ing fic@@ tion .
"So from the very beginning , fic@@ tion for me was less of an au@@ t@@ ob@@ i@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ical m@@ ani@@ f@@ est@@ ation than a tran@@ sc@@ en@@ den@@ tal jour@@ ney into other lives , other pos@@ sibil@@ ities ."
And ple@@ ase be@@ ar with me : I &apos;ll dra@@ w a cir@@ cle and come back to this point .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at .
"So from this small , super@@ st@@ iti@@ ous , mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ clas@@ s ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od of my gran@@ d@@ mother , I was z@@ o@@ om@@ ed into this pos@@ h , inter@@ national school &#91; in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d &#93; , where I was the only T@@ ur@@ k ."
"It was here that I had my first en@@ coun@@ ter with what I call the &quot; &quot; re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative fore@@ ig@@ ner . &quot; &quot; In our clas@@ s@@ room , there were children from all n@@ ation@@ al@@ ities , yet this di@@ vers@@ ity did not ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily le@@ ad to a c@@ os@@ mo@@ polit@@ an , eg@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an clas@@ s@@ room demo@@ cra@@ cy ."
"In@@ st@@ ead , it gener@@ ated an at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here in which each child was seen — not as an individu@@ al on his own , but as the re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative of something lar@@ ger ."
"We were like a min@@ i@@ ature United N@@ ations , which was fu@@ n , exc@@ ept wh@@ en@@ ever something ne@@ g@@ ative , with reg@@ ar@@ ds to a n@@ ation or a religi@@ on , took place ."
"The child who re@@ pres@@ ented it was mo@@ c@@ ked , ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ed and bu@@ l@@ li@@ ed en@@ dl@@ ess@@ ly ."
"And I should know , because during the time I atten@@ ded that school , a mil@@ it@@ ary tak@@ e@@ over happened in my country , a g@@ un@@ man of my n@@ ation@@ ality ne@@ arly kill@@ ed the P@@ op@@ e , and T@@ ur@@ key got zer@@ o poin@@ ts in &#91; the &#93; Euro@@ vision S@@ ong Con@@ test ."
( Laughter ) I s@@ ki@@ pped school often and dre@@ am@@ ed of be@@ coming a sa@@ il@@ or during those days .
I also had my first ta@@ st@@ e of cul@@ tu@@ ral st@@ ere@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es there .
"The other children asked me about the mo@@ vie &quot; &quot; M@@ id@@ night E@@ x@@ pres@@ s , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they in@@ qui@@ red how many ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ t@@ es a day I s@@ mo@@ ked , because they thought all T@@ ur@@ ks were he@@ av@@ y s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers , and they wonder@@ ed at what age I would start c@@ over@@ ing my ha@@ ir ."
"I came to learn that these were the three ma@@ in st@@ ere@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es about my country : polit@@ ics , ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ t@@ es and the ve@@ il ."
"A@@ f@@ ter Spa@@ in , we went to J@@ or@@ d@@ an , Ger@@ many and An@@ kar@@ a again ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ where I went , I felt like my imag@@ in@@ ation was the only su@@ it@@ case I could take with me ."
"S@@ t@@ ories gave me a sense of cent@@ er , contin@@ u@@ ity and co@@ her@@ ence , the three big C@@ s that I o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se l@@ ac@@ ked ."
"In my mid@@ -@@ tw@@ enti@@ es , I mo@@ ved to I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , the city I ad@@ ore ."
"I li@@ ved in a very vi@@ b@@ ran@@ t , di@@ ver@@ se ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od where I w@@ ro@@ te sever@@ al of my nov@@ els ."
I was in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l when the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke h@@ it in 199@@ 9 .
"When I ran out of the building at three in the mor@@ ning , I saw something that sto@@ pped me in my tra@@ cks ."
"There was the local gro@@ cer there — a gru@@ m@@ py , old man who didn &apos;t s@@ ell al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and didn &apos;t speak to mar@@ g@@ in@@ als ."
He was sit@@ ting next to a tran@@ sv@@ est@@ ite with a long black wi@@ g and mas@@ car@@ a ru@@ n@@ ning down her che@@ eks .
"I wat@@ ched the man open a p@@ ack of ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ t@@ es with t@@ rem@@ bl@@ ing hands and off@@ er one to her , and that is the image of the night of the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke in my mind today — a con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative gro@@ cer and a c@@ ry@@ ing tran@@ sv@@ est@@ ite s@@ mo@@ king together on the si@@ de@@ walk ."
"In the face of de@@ ath and dest@@ ru@@ ction , our m@@ un@@ dan@@ e differ@@ ences e@@ va@@ por@@ ated , and we all became one even if for a few hours ."
"But I &apos;ve always beli@@ ev@@ ed that stories , too , have a si@@ mil@@ ar eff@@ ect on us ."
"I &apos;m not saying that fic@@ tion has the mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de of an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , but when we are read@@ ing a good nov@@ el , we leave our small , co@@ zy a@@ part@@ ments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been bi@@ as@@ ed against ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , I went to a women &apos;s colle@@ ge in B@@ ost@@ on , then M@@ ich@@ ig@@ an ."
"I experi@@ en@@ ced this , not so much as a ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ical shi@@ ft , as a lin@@ gu@@ ist@@ ic one ."
I started writ@@ ing fic@@ tion in En@@ gli@@ sh .
"I &apos;m not an im@@ mi@@ gran@@ t , re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee or ex@@ ile — they ask me why I do this — but the com@@ mu@@ te between langu@@ ages gi@@ ves me the chan@@ ce to re@@ create myself ."
"I love writ@@ ing in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , which to me is very po@@ et@@ ic and very emot@@ i@@ onal , and I love writ@@ ing in En@@ gli@@ sh , which to me is very ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal and c@@ ere@@ bra@@ l ."
So I feel conne@@ cted to each language in a different way .
"For me , like milli@@ ons of other people around the world today , En@@ gli@@ sh is an ac@@ qui@@ red language ."
"When you &apos;re a l@@ at@@ e@@ com@@ er to a language , what happens is you live there with a contin@@ u@@ ous and per@@ p@@ et@@ ual f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation ."
"As l@@ at@@ e@@ com@@ ers , we always want to say more , you know , cra@@ ck better j@@ ok@@ es , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a ga@@ p between the mind and the ton@@ gu@@ e ."
And that ga@@ p is very in@@ tim@@ id@@ ating .
"But if we man@@ age not to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed by it , it &apos;s also st@@ im@@ ul@@ ating ."
And this is what I discover@@ ed in B@@ ost@@ on — that f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation was very st@@ im@@ ul@@ ating .
"A@@ t this stage , my gran@@ d@@ mother , who had been wat@@ ching the course of my life with incre@@ as@@ ing an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , started to inclu@@ de in her da@@ ily pra@@ y@@ ers that I ur@@ g@@ ently get mar@@ ri@@ ed so that I could set@@ tle down once and for all ."
"And because G@@ od lov@@ es her , I did get mar@@ ri@@ ed ."
"( Laughter ) But instead of set@@ t@@ ling down , I went to A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona ."
"And since my h@@ us@@ b@@ and is in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , I started com@@ mu@@ ting between A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona and I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l — the two places on the surface of ear@@ th that couldn &apos;t be more different ."
"I gu@@ ess one part of me has always been a no@@ ma@@ d , physi@@ cally and sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ ally ."
"S@@ t@@ ories ac@@ company me , ke@@ ep@@ ing my pi@@ ec@@ es and mem@@ ories together , like an exist@@ ential gl@@ ue ."
"@@ Y@@ et as much as I love stories , rec@@ ently , I &apos;ve also be@@ gu@@ n to think that they lo@@ se their ma@@ gic if and when a story is seen as more than a story ."
And this is a sub@@ ject that I would love to think about together .
"When my first nov@@ el writ@@ ten in En@@ gli@@ sh came out in America , I heard an interesting rem@@ ar@@ k from a liter@@ ary c@@ r@@ iti@@ c ."
"&quot; I li@@ ked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I w@@ ish you had writ@@ ten it differ@@ ently . &quot;"
( Laughter ) I asked him what he me@@ ant by that .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many S@@ pan@@ ish , American , H@@ is@@ p@@ ani@@ c charac@@ ters in it , but there &apos;s only one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish charac@@ ter and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the nov@@ el took place on a univers@@ ity cam@@ p@@ us in B@@ ost@@ on , so to me , it was norm@@ al that there be more inter@@ national charac@@ ters in it than T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish charac@@ ters , but I under@@ sto@@ od what my c@@ r@@ iti@@ c was looking for ."
And I also under@@ sto@@ od that I would keep dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting him .
He wanted to see the m@@ ani@@ f@@ est@@ ation of my id@@ ent@@ ity .
He was looking for a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
"We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of id@@ ent@@ ity polit@@ ics aff@@ ec@@ ts the way stories are being cir@@ cul@@ ated , read and re@@ vi@@ e@@ wed ."
"M@@ any au@@ th@@ ors feel this pres@@ sure , but no@@ n-@@ W@@ ester@@ n au@@ th@@ ors feel it more he@@ av@@ ily ."
"If you &apos;re a woman writ@@ er from the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , like me , then you are expe@@ cted to write the stories of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women and , pre@@ fer@@ ably , the un@@ happy stories of un@@ happy M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"You &apos;re expe@@ cted to write inform@@ ative , po@@ ig@@ n@@ ant and charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ic stories and leave the experim@@ en@@ tal and av@@ an@@ t-@@ gar@@ de to your W@@ ester@@ n colle@@ ag@@ ues ."
What I experi@@ en@@ ced as a child in that school in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d is happening in the liter@@ ary world today .
"W@@ rit@@ ers are not seen as cre@@ ative individu@@ als on their own , but as the re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ati@@ ves of their re@@ spe@@ ctive cul@@ tures : a few au@@ th@@ ors from China , a few from T@@ ur@@ key , a few from N@@ ig@@ eri@@ a ."
"We &apos;re all thought to have something very dist@@ in@@ ctive , if not pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ."
The writ@@ er and com@@ mu@@ ter J@@ am@@ es B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in gave an inter@@ view in 19@@ 8@@ 4 in which he was re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly asked about his ho@@ mo@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ ality .
"When the inter@@ vi@@ e@@ wer tri@@ ed to p@@ ig@@ e@@ on@@ h@@ ole him as a g@@ ay writ@@ er , B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in sto@@ pped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en id@@ ent@@ ity polit@@ ics tries to put lab@@ els on us , it is our fre@@ e@@ dom of imag@@ in@@ ation that is in dan@@ ger ."
There &apos;s a fu@@ z@@ zy cat@@ eg@@ ory called mul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral liter@@ ature in which all au@@ th@@ ors from outside the W@@ ester@@ n world are l@@ um@@ ped together .
"I never for@@ get my first mul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral read@@ ing , in H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard S@@ qu@@ are about 10 years ago ."
"We were three writ@@ ers , one from the P@@ h@@ ili@@ pp@@ ines , one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish and one In@@ don@@ es@@ i@@ an — like a jo@@ ke , you know ."
( Laughter ) And the reason why we were b@@ rou@@ ght together was not because we sha@@ red an arti@@ st@@ ic st@@ y@@ le or a liter@@ ary ta@@ st@@ e .
It was only because of our pas@@ s@@ por@@ ts .
"M@@ ul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral writ@@ ers are expe@@ cted to tell real stories , not so much the imag@@ in@@ ary ."
A fun@@ ction is at@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted to fic@@ tion .
"In this way , not only the writ@@ ers themselves , but also their fic@@ ti@@ onal charac@@ ters become the re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ati@@ ves of something lar@@ ger ."
But I must quickly ad@@ d that this ten@@ den@@ cy to see a story as more than a story does not sol@@ ely come from the W@@ est .
It comes from every@@ where .
And I experi@@ en@@ ced this fi@@ r@@ s@@ th@@ and when I was put on tri@@ al in 200@@ 5 for the words my fic@@ ti@@ onal charac@@ ters ut@@ ter@@ ed in a nov@@ el .
"I had in@@ ten@@ ded to write a con@@ stru@@ ctive , mul@@ ti@@ -@@ la@@ y@@ er@@ ed nov@@ el about an Ar@@ m@@ eni@@ an and a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish family through the eyes of women ."
My mic@@ ro story became a m@@ ac@@ ro issue when I was pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed .
"S@@ ome people c@@ rit@@ ic@@ iz@@ ed , others pra@@ is@@ ed me for writ@@ ing about the T@@ ur@@ ki@@ sh@@ -@@ Ar@@ m@@ eni@@ an conf@@ li@@ ct ."
But there were times when I wanted to rem@@ ind both sid@@ es that this was fic@@ tion .
It was just a story .
"And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to bel@@ it@@ tle my work ."
"I want to love and c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate fic@@ tion for what it is , not as a means to an end ."
"W@@ rit@@ ers are ent@@ it@@ led to their polit@@ ical op@@ in@@ i@@ ons , and there are good polit@@ ical nov@@ els out there , but the language of fic@@ tion is not the language of da@@ ily polit@@ ics ."
"Ch@@ ek@@ ho@@ v said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the cor@@ rec@@ t way of pos@@ ing the question are two completely se@@ par@@ ate things ."
And only the l@@ at@@ ter is an art@@ ist &apos;s respon@@ sibil@@ ity . &quot; &quot; I@@ d@@ ent@@ ity polit@@ ics di@@ vid@@ es us . F@@ ic@@ tion conne@@ c@@ ts .
One is interest@@ ed in s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing gener@@ aliz@@ ations .
"The other , in nu@@ an@@ ces ."
One dra@@ ws b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es .
The other recogniz@@ es no fron@@ ti@@ ers .
I@@ d@@ ent@@ ity polit@@ ics is made of sol@@ id bri@@ cks .
F@@ ic@@ tion is flo@@ wing water .
"In the Ot@@ tom@@ an times , there were it@@ in@@ er@@ ant stor@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ ers called &quot; &quot; me@@ d@@ da@@ h . &quot; &quot; They would go to co@@ ff@@ ee hou@@ ses , where they would tell a story in front of an audi@@ ence , often impro@@ vis@@ ing ."
"W@@ ith each new person in the story , the me@@ d@@ da@@ h would change his vo@@ ice , im@@ person@@ ating that charac@@ ter ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body could go and list@@ en , you know — ordin@@ ary people , even the sul@@ t@@ an , M@@ us@@ li@@ ms and no@@ n-@@ M@@ us@@ li@@ ms ."
"S@@ t@@ ories c@@ ut across all b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es , like &quot; &quot; The T@@ al@@ es of N@@ as@@ red@@ d@@ in H@@ od@@ ja , &quot; &quot; which were very popul@@ ar throu@@ gh@@ out the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast , Nor@@ th Africa , the B@@ al@@ k@@ ans and A@@ si@@ a ."
"T@@ oday , stories contin@@ ue to tran@@ sc@@ end bor@@ ders ."
"When P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ i@@ an and I@@ s@@ ra@@ eli polit@@ ici@@ ans talk , they u@@ su@@ ally don &apos;t list@@ en to each other , but a P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ i@@ an read@@ er still re@@ ads a nov@@ el by a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish au@@ th@@ or , and vice ver@@ sa , conne@@ c@@ ting and em@@ pa@@ th@@ iz@@ ing with the nar@@ rat@@ or ."
L@@ it@@ er@@ ature has to take us be@@ y@@ ond .
"If it can@@ not take us there , it is not good liter@@ ature ."
"B@@ o@@ oks have sav@@ ed the in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted , tim@@ id child that I was — that I once was ."
But I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the dan@@ ger of f@@ et@@ ish@@ iz@@ ing them .
"When the po@@ et and my@@ st@@ ic , R@@ u@@ mi , met his sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual compani@@ on , Sh@@ am@@ s of T@@ ab@@ ri@@ z , one of the first things the l@@ at@@ ter did was to to@@ s@@ s R@@ u@@ mi &apos;s bo@@ oks into water and wat@@ ch the let@@ ters dis@@ sol@@ ve ."
"The Su@@ f@@ is say , &quot; &quot; K@@ no@@ w@@ led@@ ge that takes you not be@@ y@@ ond y@@ ourself is far wor@@ se than ig@@ no@@ ran@@ ce . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cul@@ tu@@ ral gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is not l@@ ack of knowled@@ ge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowled@@ ge that takes us not be@@ y@@ ond ourselves : it makes us el@@ it@@ ist , dist@@ ant and dis@@ conne@@ cted ."
There &apos;s a met@@ ap@@ h@@ or which I love : living like a dra@@ wing comp@@ as@@ s .
"As you know , one le@@ g of the comp@@ as@@ s is st@@ atic , ro@@ ot@@ ed in a place ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the other le@@ g dra@@ ws a wi@@ de cir@@ cle , con@@ stan@@ tly moving ."
"L@@ ike that , my fic@@ tion as well ."
"One part of it is ro@@ ot@@ ed in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , with stron@@ g T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish ro@@ ots , but the other part trav@@ els the world , conne@@ c@@ ting to different cul@@ tures ."
"In that sense , I like to think of my fic@@ tion as both local and univers@@ al , both from here and every@@ where ."
"Now those of you who have been to I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l have probably seen T@@ op@@ ka@@ p@@ i P@@ al@@ ace , which was the re@@ sid@@ ence of Ot@@ tom@@ an sul@@ t@@ ans for more than 4@@ 00 years ."
"In the pal@@ ace , just outside the qu@@ ar@@ ters of the fav@@ or@@ ite con@@ cu@@ b@@ ines , there &apos;s an area called The G@@ a@@ ther@@ ing P@@ l@@ ace of the D@@ j@@ in@@ n ."
It &apos;s between buil@@ din@@ gs .
I &apos;m in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by this conc@@ ept .
We u@@ su@@ ally di@@ stru@@ st those are@@ as that f@@ all in between things .
"We see them as the dom@@ a@@ in of super@@ natural cre@@ at@@ ures like the d@@ j@@ in@@ n , who are made of s@@ mo@@ k@@ el@@ ess fi@@ re and are the sym@@ bo@@ l of el@@ u@@ si@@ ven@@ ess ."
But my point is perhaps that el@@ u@@ sive space is what writ@@ ers and arti@@ sts need most .
Wh@@ en I write fic@@ tion I cher@@ ish el@@ u@@ si@@ ven@@ ess and chan@@ ge@@ ability .
I like not kno@@ wing what will happen 10 p@@ ages later .
I like it when my charac@@ ters surpri@@ se me .
"I might write about a M@@ us@@ li@@ m woman in one nov@@ el , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a han@@ d@@ some , g@@ ay prof@@ ess@@ or in Nor@@ way ."
"As long as it comes from our hear@@ ts , we can write about anything and everything ."
"A@@ ud@@ re L@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; &quot; The white fa@@ thers ta@@ u@@ ght us to say , &apos; I think , th@@ ere@@ fore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed , &quot; &quot; I feel , th@@ ere@@ fore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful pa@@ radi@@ g@@ m shi@@ ft ."
"And yet , why is it that , in cre@@ ative writ@@ ing cour@@ ses today , the very first thing we te@@ ach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?"
Per@@ haps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
I@@ mag@@ in@@ ative liter@@ ature is not ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily about writ@@ ing who we are or what we know or what our id@@ ent@@ ity is about .
We should te@@ ach young people and ourselves to ex@@ p@@ and our hear@@ ts and write what we can feel .
We should get out of our cul@@ tu@@ ral gh@@ et@@ to and go vi@@ sit the next one and the next .
"In the end , stories move like wh@@ ir@@ ling der@@ vi@@ sh@@ es , dra@@ wing cir@@ cl@@ es be@@ y@@ ond cir@@ cl@@ es ."
"They conne@@ ct all hum@@ an@@ ity , reg@@ ar@@ dl@@ ess of id@@ ent@@ ity polit@@ ics , and that is the good news ."
"And I would like to fin@@ ish with an old Su@@ f@@ i po@@ em : &quot; &quot; C@@ ome , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lov@@ ers and lov@@ ed ones ; the ear@@ th sh@@ all be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m J@@ ane M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game desig@@ ner .
We do achi@@ eve more in game wor@@ l@@ ds .
"So , so far , colle@@ cti@@ vely all the Wor@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have sp@@ ent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tual problems of A@@ zer@@ ot@@ h ."
"Now , that &apos;s not ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily a bad thing ."
We &apos;re evol@@ ving to be a more col@@ labor@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
And we actually build stron@@ ger social relation@@ shi@@ ps as a resul@@ t .
F@@ i@@ ve million people use it every mon@@ th .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to sol@@ ve .
H@@ is work is br@@ illi@@ ant .
"But it is not , by any means , an op@@ tim@@ al situ@@ ation ."
We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
"B@@ e@@ fore we had aw@@ es@@ ome game contro@@ l@@ l@@ ers , we had she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ c@@ kl@@ es ."
P@@ eople were su@@ ff@@ ering . P@@ eople were fi@@ gh@@ ting .
This is really exc@@ iting .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al di@@ ce game ."
"We want to imagine e@@ pi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to achi@@ eve the e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in ."
We made this game in 200@@ 7 .
This is an amazing story and adv@@ ent@@ ure for you to go on .
"We &apos;ve got a gra@@ ph@@ ic nov@@ el , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in sk@@ ill@@ s like local in@@ si@@ ght , knowled@@ ge net@@ working , su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability , vision and resour@@ c@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness ."
"The &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; cre@@ w and I were called to a little to@@ wn in C@@ ol@@ or@@ a@@ do , called C@@ ra@@ i@@ g ."
It &apos;s only a couple do@@ z@@ en squ@@ are mil@@ es . It &apos;s in the R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es .
And the job in question was she@@ ep ran@@ ch@@ er .
"My ro@@ le on the show , for those of you who hav@@ en &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple ."
"I &apos;m an ap@@ pr@@ enti@@ ce , and I work with the people who actually do the j@@ ob@@ s in question ."
"And my respon@@ sibil@@ ities are to simply try and keep up and give an h@@ on@@ est ac@@ coun@@ t of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life ."
The job in question : her@@ ding she@@ ep . Gre@@ at .
We go to C@@ ra@@ i@@ g and we ch@@ ec@@ k in to a hotel and I realiz@@ e the next day that c@@ ast@@ r@@ ation is going to be an absol@@ ute part of this work .
"So , norm@@ ally , I never do any research at all ."
"But , this is a tou@@ ch@@ y sub@@ ject , and I work for the D@@ is@@ c@@ over@@ y Ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l , and we want to por@@ tra@@ y acc@@ ur@@ ately what@@ ever it is we do , and we cer@@ tain@@ ly want to do it with a lot of re@@ spe@@ ct for the animals ."
"So I called the H@@ um@@ ane So@@ ci@@ ety and I say , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , I &apos;m going to be c@@ ast@@ rat@@ ing some l@@ am@@ b@@ s , C@@ an you tell me the de@@ al ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward . &quot; &quot; They use a b@@ and — basically a ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and , like this , only a little sm@@ all@@ er ."
"This one was actually around the pla@@ ying car@@ ds I got y@@ ester@@ day , but it had a certain famili@@ ar@@ ity to it ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The b@@ and is app@@ li@@ ed to the ta@@ il , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
"And then another b@@ and is app@@ li@@ ed to the sc@@ ro@@ tu@@ m , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
B@@ lo@@ od f@@ low is slo@@ w@@ ly ret@@ ar@@ ded ; a week later the parts in question f@@ all off .
&quot; Gre@@ at — got it . &quot;
"O@@ K , I call the S@@ P@@ C@@ A to con@@ fi@@ r@@ m this — they con@@ fi@@ r@@ m it ."
"I also call P@@ E@@ T@@ A , just for fu@@ n , and they don &apos;t like it — but they con@@ fi@@ r@@ m it ."
"O@@ K , that &apos;s basically how you do it ."
So the next day I go out .
"And I &apos;m given a hor@@ se and we go get the l@@ am@@ b@@ s and we take them to a p@@ en that we built , and we go about the business of anim@@ al h@@ us@@ ban@@ d@@ ry ."
M@@ el@@ anie is the wi@@ fe of Al@@ ber@@ t .
Al@@ ber@@ t is the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d in question .
"M@@ el@@ anie pic@@ ks up the l@@ am@@ b — two hands — one hand on both le@@ gs on the right , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se on the left ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the pos@@ t , she op@@ ens it up ."
Al@@ right . Gre@@ at .
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t goes in , I fol@@ low Al@@ ber@@ t , the cre@@ w is around ."
I always wat@@ ch the process done the first time before I try it .
"B@@ eing an ap@@ pr@@ enti@@ ce , you know , you do that ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t re@@ ach@@ es in his po@@ ck@@ et to pul@@ l out , you know , this black ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and but what comes out instead is a kni@@ fe ."
"And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not ru@@ b@@ ber at all , you know ."
"And he kind of f@@ lic@@ ked it open in a way that cau@@ ght the su@@ n that was just coming over the R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es , it was very — it was , it was im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"In the space of about two secon@@ ds , Al@@ ber@@ t had the kni@@ fe between the car@@ t@@ il@@ age of the ta@@ il , right next to the bu@@ t@@ t of the l@@ am@@ b , and very quickly the ta@@ il was gone and in the bu@@ ck@@ et that I was hol@@ ding ."
"A second later , with a big th@@ um@@ b and a well call@@ ou@@ sed fore@@ fin@@ ger , he had the sc@@ ro@@ tu@@ m fi@@ r@@ m@@ ly in his g@@ ras@@ p ."
"And he pul@@ led it to@@ ward him , like so , and he took the kni@@ fe and he put it on the ti@@ p ."
"Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , M@@ i@@ cha@@ el — you don &apos;t , OK ?"

C@@ an we ro@@ ll the video ?
No I &apos;m ki@@ d@@ ding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pic@@ tures .

How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those mo@@ ments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and sud@@ den@@ ly , I &apos;m standing there , in the R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es , and all I can think of is the A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ el@@ i@@ an de@@ fin@@ ition of a tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y ."

And they are an@@ ag@@ no@@ ris@@ is and peri@@ p@@ et@@ ei@@ a .
A@@ na@@ g@@ no@@ ris@@ is and peri@@ p@@ et@@ ei@@ a .
A@@ na@@ g@@ no@@ ris@@ is is the Gre@@ ek word for discover@@ y .
"L@@ it@@ er@@ ally , the trans@@ ition from ig@@ no@@ ran@@ ce to knowled@@ ge is an@@ ag@@ no@@ ris@@ is ."
It &apos;s what our net@@ work does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; is .

"The other word , peri@@ p@@ et@@ ei@@ a , that &apos;s the moment in the great tra@@ ge@@ di@@ es , you know — E@@ u@@ ri@@ pi@@ des and S@@ op@@ ho@@ cl@@ es — the moment where O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us has his moment , where he sud@@ den@@ ly realiz@@ es that ho@@ t ch@@ ick he &apos;s been sle@@ ep@@ ing with and having bab@@ ies with is his mother .

That &apos;s peri@@ p@@ ety or peri@@ p@@ et@@ ei@@ a .

"L@@ o@@ oking at that po@@ or other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was stru@@ ck by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a liter@@ al way , what other peri@@ pat@@ et@@ ic mis@@ conc@@ ep@@ tions might I be able to com@@ ment u@@ po@@ n ?"
"Because , look , I &apos;m not a social an@@ th@@ ro@@ polo@@ g@@ ist but I have a friend who is ."
And I talk to him .
"( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey M@@ ike ."
"L@@ o@@ ok , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interest@@ ed in this sort of thing or not , but do you realiz@@ e you &apos;ve sh@@ ot in every state ?"
"You &apos;ve worked in min@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in fi@@ sh@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in ste@@ el , you &apos;ve worked in every maj@@ or indu@@ stry ."

"&quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thou@@ ghts , colle@@ cti@@ vely , it might be time to think about it ."
"Because , du@@ de , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , test@@ ic@@ les are on my ch@@ in , thou@@ ghts are b@@ oun@@ cing around ."
"And , after that sho@@ ot , D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , person@@ ally ."
"And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 19@@ 0 like it ."
"I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other not@@ i@@ ons of work that I &apos;ve just been as@@ sum@@ ing are s@@ ac@@ ros@@ an@@ ct , and they &apos;re not ."

"And I don &apos;t want to start wh@@ ist@@ ling &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok for the Uni@@ on L@@ a@@ be@@ l , &quot; &quot; and all that happy work@@ er cra@@ p ."
I &apos;m just telling you that these are bal@@ an@@ ced people who do un@@ thin@@ ka@@ ble work .
R@@ o@@ ad@@ k@@ ill pic@@ k@@ er@@ -@@ up@@ per@@ s wh@@ ist@@ le while they work . I s@@ we@@ ar to G@@ od — I did it with them .
They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of sym@@ met@@ ry to their life .
And I see it over and over and over again .
So I started to won@@ der what would happen if we chall@@ eng@@ ed some of these s@@ ac@@ red co@@ ws .
F@@ ol@@ low your pas@@ sion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 3@@ 6 hours .
F@@ ol@@ low your pas@@ sion — what could pos@@ si@@ bly be wrong with that ?
P@@ rob@@ ably the wor@@ st ad@@ vice I ever got .
"( Laughter ) You know , fol@@ low your dre@@ am@@ s and go bro@@ ke , right ?"
"I mean , that &apos;s all I heard gro@@ wing up ."
"I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you fol@@ low your pas@@ sion , it &apos;s going to work out ."
"I can give you 30 exam@@ ples , right now — B@@ ob C@@ om@@ b@@ s , the pi@@ g far@@ mer in L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as who colle@@ c@@ ts the u@@ ne@@ at@@ en sc@@ ra@@ ps of food from the c@@ as@@ in@@ os and fe@@ ed@@ s them them to his sw@@ ine ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because there &apos;s so much prote@@ in in the stuff we don &apos;t e@@ at his p@@ ig@@ s grow at tw@@ ice the norm@@ al spe@@ ed , and he is one ri@@ ch pi@@ g far@@ mer , and he is good for the environment , and he sp@@ ends his days doing this incredi@@ ble ser@@ vice , and he sm@@ ell@@ s like h@@ ell , but G@@ od bl@@ ess him ."
He &apos;s making a great living .
"You ask him , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you fol@@ low your pas@@ sion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d lau@@ gh at you ."
"The guy &apos;s wor@@ th — he just got off@@ er@@ ed like 60 million dollars for his far@@ m and turned it down , outside of V@@ eg@@ as ."
He didn &apos;t fol@@ low his pas@@ sion .
He ste@@ pped back and he wat@@ ched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
And I hear that story over and over .
"M@@ at@@ t F@@ ro@@ ind , a da@@ i@@ ry far@@ mer in New C@@ an@@ a@@ an , Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ c@@ ut , who wo@@ ke up one day and realized the cra@@ p from his co@@ ws was wor@@ th more than their mil@@ k , if he could use it to make these bi@@ od@@ e@@ gra@@ d@@ able flo@@ wer po@@ ts ."
"Now , he &apos;s sel@@ ling them to W@@ al@@ mar@@ t ."
F@@ ol@@ low his pas@@ sion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
"So I started to look at pas@@ sion , I started to look at eff@@ ici@@ en@@ cy ver@@ su@@ s effec@@ tiv@@ en@@ ess — as T@@ im tal@@ ked about ear@@ li@@ er , that &apos;s a huge dist@@ in@@ ction ."
"I started to look at te@@ am@@ work and det@@ er@@ min@@ ation , and basically all those plat@@ it@@ ud@@ es they call &quot; &quot; succ@@ ess@@ ories &quot; &quot; that han@@ g with that sch@@ mal@@ t@@ zy art in bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om@@ s around the world right now ."
That stuff — it &apos;s sud@@ den@@ ly all been turned on its head .
S@@ af@@ ety — sa@@ f@@ ety first ?
"G@@ o@@ ing back to , you know , O@@ S@@ H@@ A and P@@ E@@ T@@ A and the H@@ um@@ ane So@@ ci@@ ety : what if O@@ S@@ H@@ A got it wrong ?"
"I mean — this is her@@ es@@ y , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really sa@@ f@@ ety third ?"
R@@ ight ?
"( Laughter ) No , I mean really ."
"What I mean to say is I val@@ ue my sa@@ f@@ ety on these c@@ raz@@ y j@@ ob@@ s as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about sa@@ f@@ ety first ."
"They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done ."
"And I &apos;ll never for@@ get , up in the B@@ ering Se@@ a , I was on a cra@@ b bo@@ at with the &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ li@@ est C@@ at@@ ch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first se@@ as@@ on ."
"We &apos;re about 100 mil@@ es off the co@@ ast of R@@ us@@ si@@ a : 5@@ 0-@@ fo@@ ot se@@ as , big w@@ av@@ es , gre@@ en water coming over the whe@@ el@@ house , right ?"
"Mo@@ st ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d@@ ous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , la@@ sh@@ ing the po@@ ts down ."
"So , I &apos;m 40 fe@@ et off the de@@ ck , which is like looking down at the top of your sho@@ e , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean ."
U@@ n@@ spe@@ a@@ ka@@ bly dan@@ ger@@ ous .

"And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ S@@ H@@ A ? O@@ c@@ ean . &quot; &quot; And he poin@@ ts out there ."
"( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated in the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 ."
It can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated on any fac@@ tory flo@@ or or any con@@ stru@@ ction s@@ ite .
"But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ on &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he call@@ s me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; S@@ on , I &apos;m a cap@@ tain of a cra@@ b bo@@ at ."
My respon@@ sibil@@ ity is not to get you home ali@@ ve .
"My respon@@ sibil@@ ity is to get you home ri@@ ch . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home ali@@ ve , that &apos;s on you ."
"And for the re@@ st of that day , sa@@ f@@ ety first ."
"I was like — So , the idea that we create this f@@ al@@ se — this sense of compl@@ ac@@ en@@ cy when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s respon@@ sibil@@ ity as though it &apos;s our own , and vice ver@@ sa ."
"A@@ ny@@ how , a whole lot of things ."
I could talk at len@@ g@@ th about the many little dist@@ in@@ ctions we made and the en@@ dl@@ ess li@@ st of ways that I got it wrong .
"But , what it all comes down to is this ."
"I form@@ ed a the@@ ory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my re@@ ma@@ ining two minutes and 30 secon@@ ds ."
"It goes like this — we &apos;ve dec@@ la@@ red war on work , as a society , all of us ."
It &apos;s a ci@@ vil war .
"It &apos;s a c@@ old war , really ."
"We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t tw@@ ist our mu@@ sta@@ ch@@ e in some Ma@@ chi@@ av@@ el@@ li@@ an way , but we &apos;ve done it ."
"And we &apos;ve w@@ ag@@ ed this war on at least four fron@@ ts , cer@@ tain@@ ly in H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wo@@ od ."
The way we por@@ tra@@ y working people on T@@ V — it &apos;s l@@ augh@@ able .
"If there &apos;s a pl@@ um@@ ber , he &apos;s 3@@ 00 po@@ un@@ ds and he &apos;s got a gi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ t cra@@ ck . A@@ d@@ m@@ it it ."
You see him all the time .
"That &apos;s what pl@@ um@@ bers look like , right ?"
"We turn them into her@@ o@@ es , or we turn them into p@@ un@@ ch lin@@ es ."
That &apos;s what T@@ V does .
"We try hard on &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t che@@ at ."
"But , we &apos;ve w@@ ag@@ ed this war on M@@ ad@@ is@@ on A@@ ven@@ ue ."
"I mean , so many of the com@@ mer@@ ci@@ als that come out there — in the way of a mes@@ sage , what &apos;s really being said ?"
"@@ Y@@ our life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little ear@@ li@@ er , if you could re@@ ti@@ re a little f@@ aster , if you could p@@ un@@ ch out a little so@@ on@@ er — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again ."
W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton ? I can &apos;t even beg@@ in to talk about the de@@ als and poli@@ ci@@ es in place that aff@@ ect the bot@@ tom line reality of the av@@ ail@@ able j@@ ob@@ s because I don &apos;t really know .
I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
"And right here guys , S@@ il@@ ic@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y , I mean — how many people have an i@@ P@@ h@@ one on them right now ?"
How many people have their B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ ri@@ es ?
We &apos;re pl@@ u@@ gg@@ ed in ; we &apos;re conne@@ cted .
I would never su@@ gg@@ est for a second that something bad has come out of the te@@ ch revol@@ ution .
"G@@ o@@ od gri@@ e@@ f , not to this c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
( Laughter ) But I would su@@ gg@@ est that innov@@ ation without im@@ it@@ ation is a compl@@ ete w@@ ast@@ e of time .
And no@@ body c@@ ele@@ b@@ rat@@ es im@@ it@@ ation the way &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
"@@ Y@@ our i@@ P@@ h@@ one without those people making the same inter@@ face , the same cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry , the same bo@@ ard , over and over ?"
All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equ@@ ally as possible as the g@@ eni@@ us that goes inside of it .
"So , we &apos;ve got this new to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x , you know ."
O@@ ur to@@ ols today don &apos;t look like sh@@ ov@@ els and pic@@ ks .
They look like the stuff we walk around with .
And so the colle@@ ctive eff@@ ect of all of that has been this mar@@ g@@ in@@ aliz@@ ation of lots and lots of j@@ ob@@ s .
"And I realized , probably too l@@ ate in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 2@@ 00 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can ."
"And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the test@@ ic@@ les on my ch@@ in ."
I got a lot wrong .
"So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a P@@ R cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n for work , man@@ ual lab@@ or , sk@@ ill@@ ed lab@@ or ."
S@@ om@@ e@@ body needs to be out there talking about the for@@ got@@ ten ben@@ ef@@ its .
"I &apos;m talking about gran@@ d@@ father stuff , the stuff a lot us probably gre@@ w up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little ."
B@@ a@@ ra@@ ck wan@@ ts to create two and a half million j@@ ob@@ s .
The infra@@ structure is a huge de@@ al .
"This war on work , that I sup@@ pose exist@@ s , has c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ti@@ es like any other war ."
The infra@@ structure &apos;s the first one ; de@@ cl@@ ining tra@@ de@@ -@@ school en@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ ments are the second one .
"E@@ very single year : fe@@ wer electri@@ ci@@ ans , fe@@ wer car@@ pen@@ ters , fe@@ wer pl@@ um@@ bers , fe@@ wer w@@ el@@ ders , fe@@ wer pi@@ pe@@ f@@ it@@ ters , fe@@ wer ste@@ am@@ f@@ it@@ ters ."
"The infra@@ structure j@@ ob@@ s that everybody is talking about cre@@ ating are those guys — the ones that have been in de@@ cl@@ ine , over and over ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , we &apos;ve got two tr@@ il@@ lion dollars — at a min@@ im@@ um , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the American So@@ ci@@ ety of C@@ i@@ vil En@@ g@@ ine@@ ers — that we need to ex@@ p@@ end to even make a dent in the infra@@ structure , which is cur@@ r@@ ently rat@@ ed at a D min@@ us ."
"So , if I were ru@@ n@@ ning for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to make and the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to create are@@ n &apos;t going to st@@ ick un@@ less they &apos;re j@@ ob@@ s that people want ."
"And I know the point of this con@@ fer@@ ence is to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate things that are ne@@ ar and de@@ ar to us , but I also know that cle@@ an and di@@ r@@ ty are@@ n &apos;t op@@ pos@@ it@@ es ."
"They &apos;re two sid@@ es of the same co@@ in , just like innov@@ ation and im@@ it@@ ation , like risk and respon@@ sibil@@ ity , like peri@@ p@@ et@@ ia and an@@ ag@@ no@@ ris@@ is , like that po@@ or little l@@ am@@ b , who I hope isn &apos;t qui@@ ver@@ ing any@@ more , and like my time that &apos;s gone ."
"It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?"
( Applause )
"My big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lo@@ ck bil@@ li@@ ons of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ or@@ m@@ ant inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is sle@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of ty@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room

"I h@@ it my head on my des@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ ek@@ b@@ one , I got five st@@ it@@ ch@@ es on my right e@@ ye ."

"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about e@@ ight o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re lik@@ ely to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck is too l@@ ate for me , but that &apos;s o@@ kay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence call@@ s and me@@ et you at e@@ ight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly bu@@ sy and produc@@ tive , but the tru@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had br@@ illi@@ ant lea@@ ders in business , in fin@@ ance , in polit@@ ics , making ter@@ ri@@ ble deci@@ sions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good le@@ ad@@ er , because the ess@@ ence of lea@@ der@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ ani@@ c ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs hit@@ ting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ics .
"In fact , I have a feel@@ ing that if L@@ eh@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was L@@ eh@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ ist@@ ers , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ ile all the bro@@ thers were bu@@ sy just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ conne@@ cted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a sist@@ er would have not@@ ic@@ ed the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g , because she would have w@@ ok@@ en up from a se@@ ven@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f@@ - or ei@@ gh@@ t-@@ h@@ our sle@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the mul@@ ti@@ ple cri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a pers@@ onal level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , g@@ rat@@ it@@ u@@ de , effec@@ tiv@@ en@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your eyes and disc@@ over the great ideas that li@@ e inside us , to sh@@ ut your eng@@ ines and disc@@ over the power of sle@@ ep ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Well , as Ch@@ ris poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the fun@@ ctions and structure of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a minut@@ e about what this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
"H@@ ere is this mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly , thre@@ e-@@ po@@ u@@ nd mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly you can h@@ old in the pal@@ m of your hand , and it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the va@@ st@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ la@@ r space ."
It can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate itself con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating on the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the hol@@ y gra@@ il of ne@@ uro@@ science , of ne@@ uro@@ lo@@ gy , and ho@@ pe@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous org@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little w@@ is@@ ps of pro@@ to@@ pl@@ as@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this activ@@ ity em@@ er@@ ges the whole spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of abil@@ ities that we call human nature and human consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the fun@@ ctions of the human brain ."
"One appro@@ ach , the one we use ma@@ in@@ ly , is to look at patients with su@@ sta@@ ined dam@@ age to a small regi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a genet@@ ic change in a small regi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an ac@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ ities , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your c@@ og@@ n@@ itive ability ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly sel@@ ec@@ tive lo@@ s@@ s of one fun@@ ction , with other fun@@ ctions being pre@@ ser@@ ved in@@ ta@@ ct , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how invol@@ ved in medi@@ ating that fun@@ ction ."
"So you can then ma@@ p fun@@ ction on@@ to structure , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular fun@@ ction ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king exam@@ ples of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m gi@@ ving you three exam@@ ples , six minutes each , during this talk ."
The first example is an extra@@ ordin@@ ary sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me called C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the tem@@ po@@ ral l@@ ob@@ es , fron@@ tal l@@ ob@@ es , par@@ i@@ et@@ al l@@ ob@@ es , OK — the l@@ ob@@ es that con@@ st@@ it@@ ute the brain ."
"And if you look , tu@@ c@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner surface of the tem@@ po@@ ral l@@ ob@@ es — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s dam@@ ag@@ ed , you can no longer recogniz@@ e people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still recogniz@@ e them from their vo@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , that &apos;s J@@ oe , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even recogniz@@ e y@@ ourself in the mir@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you win@@ k and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mir@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really recogniz@@ e y@@ ourself as y@@ ourself ."
OK . Now that sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me is well known as cau@@ sed by dam@@ age to the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s .
"But there &apos;s another ra@@ re sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me , so ra@@ re , in fact , that very few physi@@ ci@@ ans have heard about it , not even ne@@ uro@@ lo@@ gi@@ sts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s del@@ u@@ sion , and that is a pati@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely norm@@ al , has had a head in@@ ju@@ ry , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely norm@@ al , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ post@@ or ."
"S@@ he &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is perf@@ ec@@ tly lu@@ ci@@ d and intellig@@ ent in all other re@@ spe@@ c@@ ts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his del@@ u@@ sion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pret@@ ation of this , which you find in all the p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ oks , is a F@@ re@@ udi@@ an view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same argu@@ ment app@@ li@@ es to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys ."
"When you &apos;re a little bab@@ y , a young bab@@ y , you had a stron@@ g se@@ x@@ ual at@@ tra@@ ction to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us complex of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the stan@@ d@@ ard F@@ re@@ udi@@ an view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ x@@ ual ur@@ ges to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank G@@ od , or you would all be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally a@@ ro@@ used when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , dam@@ ag@@ ing the cor@@ te@@ x , allo@@ wing these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ x@@ ual ur@@ ges to em@@ er@@ ge , fl@@ am@@ ing to the surface , and sud@@ den@@ ly and in@@ ex@@ p@@ lic@@ ably you find y@@ ourself being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally a@@ ro@@ used by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; My G@@ od , if this is my mom , how come I &apos;m being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ post@@ or . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pret@@ ation that makes sense to your dam@@ ag@@ ed brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this argu@@ ment ."
"It &apos;s very ing@@ eni@@ ous , as all F@@ re@@ udi@@ an argu@@ ments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same del@@ u@@ sion , a pati@@ ent having the same del@@ u@@ sion , about his p@@ et po@@ od@@ le . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ i@@ f@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ i@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ udi@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the l@@ at@@ ent b@@ esti@@ ality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to expla@@ in this cu@@ ri@@ ous dis@@ order , we look at the structure and fun@@ ctions of the norm@@ al vis@@ ual pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , vis@@ ual sig@@ n@@ als come in , into the e@@ ye@@ b@@ all@@ s , go to the vis@@ ual are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vision , and after proc@@ ess@@ ing all that , the mes@@ sage goes to a small structure called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s , where you perc@@ ei@@ ve fac@@ es ."
There are neu@@ ron@@ s there that are sen@@ s@@ itive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that area &apos;s dam@@ ag@@ ed , you lo@@ se the ability to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that area , the mes@@ sage c@@ as@@ c@@ ad@@ es into a structure called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emot@@ i@@ onal cor@@ e of the brain , and that structure , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , g@@ au@@ ges the emot@@ i@@ onal sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pred@@ ator ? I@@ s it m@@ ate ?
"O@@ r is it something absol@@ ut@@ ely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of lin@@ t , or a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? OK ?"
Wh@@ ich you can completely ig@@ no@@ re .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is exc@@ ited , and this is something important , the mes@@ sa@@ ges then c@@ as@@ ca@@ de into the au@@ to@@ no@@ mic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating f@@ aster .
You start s@@ we@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from m@@ us@@ cul@@ ar ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ tun@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ tro@@ des on your pal@@ m and meas@@ ure the change in sk@@ in re@@ si@@ stance produc@@ ed by s@@ we@@ ating ."
"So I can det@@ er@@ m@@ ine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exc@@ ited or whether you &apos;re a@@ ro@@ used , or not , OK ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minut@@ e .
"So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an ob@@ ject , when he looks at his — any ob@@ ject for that matter , it goes to the vis@@ ual are@@ as and , ho@@ w@@ ever , and it &apos;s proc@@ ess@@ ed in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and you recogniz@@ e it as a pe@@ a plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?"
"And then the mes@@ sage c@@ as@@ c@@ ad@@ es into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , and then goes down the au@@ to@@ no@@ mic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that wi@@ re that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emot@@ i@@ onal cor@@ e of the brain , is c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So because the fu@@ si@@ form is in@@ ta@@ ct , the cha@@ p can still recogniz@@ e his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wi@@ re is c@@ ut to the emot@@ i@@ onal c@@ en@@ ters , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? R@@ ight ?"
"( Laughter ) And th@@ ere@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ ex@@ p@@ lic@@ able l@@ ack of emot@@ i@@ ons ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some stran@@ ge woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a scre@@ en , and meas@@ ure your gal@@ v@@ ani@@ c sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can meas@@ ure how you s@@ we@@ at when you see an ob@@ ject , like a table or an um@@ b@@ rel@@ la . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t s@@ we@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a lion , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start s@@ we@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about norm@@ al people — you start s@@ we@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ w@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this pati@@ ent ?"
You take the pati@@ ent and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and meas@@ ure his gal@@ v@@ ani@@ c sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and cha@@ ir@@ s and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in norm@@ al people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the gal@@ v@@ ani@@ c sk@@ in respon@@ se is fl@@ at ."
"There &apos;s no emot@@ i@@ onal re@@ action to his mother , because that wi@@ re going from the vis@@ ual are@@ as to the emot@@ i@@ onal c@@ en@@ ters is c@@ ut ."
"So his vision is norm@@ al because the vis@@ ual are@@ as are norm@@ al , his emot@@ i@@ ons are norm@@ al — he &apos;ll lau@@ gh , he &apos;ll c@@ ry , so on and so for@@ th — but the wi@@ re from vision to emot@@ i@@ ons is c@@ ut and th@@ ere@@ fore he has this del@@ u@@ sion that his mother is an im@@ post@@ or ."
"It &apos;s a lov@@ ely example of the sort of thing we do : take a biz@@ ar@@ re , se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sible , neu@@ ral p@@ sy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me and say that the stan@@ d@@ ard F@@ re@@ udi@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a pre@@ ci@@ se ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known neu@@ ral an@@ atom@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pati@@ ent then goes , and mother ph@@ ones from an ad@@ ja@@ c@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pic@@ ks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mom , how are you ? Wh@@ ere are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no del@@ u@@ sion through the phone ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate pa@@ th@@ way going from the hear@@ ing c@@ en@@ ters in the brain to the emot@@ i@@ onal c@@ en@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So this expla@@ ins why through the phone he recogniz@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ post@@ or ."
"O@@ K , how is all this complex cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we appro@@ ach this problem by consi@@ der@@ ing another cu@@ ri@@ ous sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me called ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ put@@ ated , or a le@@ g is am@@ put@@ ated , for gan@@ g@@ ren@@ e , or you lo@@ se it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a seri@@ ous problem — you contin@@ ue to vi@@ vid@@ ly feel the pres@@ ence of that mis@@ sing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ tom le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ tom with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ el@@ i@@ eve it or not , even with inter@@ nal vis@@ cer@@ a ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the u@@ ter@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ ster@@ ec@@ tom@@ y — who have a ph@@ an@@ tom u@@ ter@@ us , inclu@@ ding ph@@ an@@ tom men@@ stru@@ al cra@@ m@@ ps at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stud@@ ent asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get ph@@ an@@ tom P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ pe for scienti@@ fic en@@ qui@@ ry , but we hav@@ en &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s by doing experim@@ ents ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s c@@ la@@ im that they can move the ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll w@@ ave go@@ od@@ by@@ e ."
"Th@@ ese are very comp@@ ell@@ ing , vi@@ vid sen@@ s@@ ations ."
The pati@@ ent &apos;s not del@@ u@@ si@@ onal .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , it &apos;s a comp@@ ell@@ ing sen@@ s@@ ory experience for the pati@@ ent ."
"But ho@@ w@@ ever , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a c@@ len@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pa@@ in will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ?"
It s@@ oun@@ ds like an o@@ x@@ y@@ mo@@ ro@@ n .
"But when we were looking at the case she@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s , the orig@@ in@@ al ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed because of the peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ ju@@ ry ."
"The ac@@ tual ner@@ ve sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m was sever@@ ed , was c@@ ut , by say , a mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So the pati@@ ent had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a sl@@ ing for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ id@@ ed at@@ tem@@ pt to get ri@@ d of the pa@@ in in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ put@@ ates the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m with the same pa@@ ins , right ?"
And this is a seri@@ ous cl@@ in@@ ical problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become depres@@ sed .
"S@@ ome of them are dri@@ ven to su@@ ici@@ de , OK ?"
"So , how do you tre@@ at this sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case she@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m had been c@@ ut , and the ac@@ tual ar@@ m had been par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , and l@@ ying in a sl@@ ing for sever@@ al months before the am@@ put@@ ation , and this pa@@ in then gets car@@ ri@@ ed over into the ph@@ an@@ tom itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was in@@ ta@@ ct , but par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , the brain sen@@ ds com@@ man@@ ds to the ar@@ m , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; M@@ ov@@ e , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vis@@ ual fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; M@@ ov@@ e . No . M@@ ov@@ e . No . M@@ ov@@ e . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , OK ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ e@@ b@@ bi@@ an , as@@ soci@@ ative lin@@ k , that the mere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ s@@ ation of a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ put@@ ated the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is car@@ ri@@ es over into your body image and into your ph@@ an@@ tom , OK ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"H@@ ow do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , so you can reli@@ eve him of this exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating , c@@ len@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now sen@@ d the comm@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ tom , but give him vis@@ ual fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s ob@@ e@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ a@@ ybe you can reli@@ eve the ph@@ an@@ tom pa@@ in , the ph@@ an@@ tom cra@@ m@@ p ."
"H@@ ow do you do that ? Well , vir@@ tual reality ."
But that co@@ sts milli@@ ons of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fun@@ ding ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard bo@@ x with a mir@@ ro@@ r in the middle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ tom — so my first pati@@ ent , D@@ ere@@ k , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ put@@ ated 10 years ago .
"He had a bra@@ chi@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were c@@ ut and the ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , l@@ ying in a sl@@ ing for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ put@@ ated ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m , exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a mir@@ ro@@ r like that , in a bo@@ x , which I call a mir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x , right ?"
"And the pati@@ ent put@@ s his ph@@ an@@ tom left ar@@ m , which is c@@ len@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the mir@@ ro@@ r , and the norm@@ al hand on the right side of the mir@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same post@@ ure , the c@@ len@@ ched post@@ ure , and looks inside the mir@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ tom being resur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ fle@@ ction of the norm@@ al ar@@ m in the mir@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ tom has been resur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , w@@ ig@@ g@@ le your ph@@ an@@ tom — your real fin@@ g@@ ers , or move your real fin@@ g@@ ers while looking in the mir@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vis@@ ual im@@ pres@@ sion that the ph@@ an@@ tom is moving , right ?"
"That &apos;s obvi@@ ous , but the ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing thing is , the pati@@ ent then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is moving again , and the pa@@ in , the c@@ len@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first pati@@ ent who came in — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) My first pati@@ ent came in , and he looked in the mir@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok at your re@@ fle@@ ction of your ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ g@@ gl@@ ing , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stup@@ id . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a mir@@ ro@@ r re@@ fle@@ ction , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vid sen@@ s@@ ory experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ov@@ e your norm@@ al hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ tom . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ov@@ e your norm@@ al hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !"
And my pa@@ in is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ lo@@ se your eyes . &quot; &quot; He clo@@ ses his eyes ."
&quot; And move your norm@@ al hand . &quot;
"&quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s c@@ len@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;"
"&quot; Oh my G@@ od , o@@ h my G@@ od , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a ki@@ d in a can@@ dy st@@ ore ."
"So , I said , OK , this pro@@ ves my the@@ ory about learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is and the c@@ rit@@ ical ro@@ le of vis@@ ual in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a N@@ ob@@ el Pri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely us@@ el@@ ess ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started realiz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of par@@ al@@ ys@@ is that you see in ne@@ uro@@ lo@@ gy , like stro@@ ke , fo@@ cal dy@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ as — there may be a learned com@@ pon@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple de@@ vice of using a mir@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , D@@ ere@@ k &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ ry@@ ing a mir@@ ro@@ r to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his pa@@ in — I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , D@@ ere@@ k , take it home and pra@@ cti@@ ce with it for a week or two ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe , after a period of pra@@ cti@@ ce , you can dis@@ pen@@ se with the mir@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and start moving your par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m , and then , reli@@ eve y@@ ourself of pa@@ in . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . Ta@@ ke it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two we@@ eks , he ph@@ ones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x was gone ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ tom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s dis@@ appe@@ a@@ red . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ri@@ ed , I said , my G@@ od , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human sub@@ jects , e@@ th@@ ics and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ere@@ k , does this bo@@ ther you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m and th@@ ere@@ fore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ b@@ ow pa@@ in , no c@@ len@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ tom fore@@ ar@@ m pa@@ in , all those pa@@ ins are gone away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers dan@@ gl@@ ing from the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and your bo@@ x doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my fore@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and el@@ im@@ in@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of mag@@ ici@@ an ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sen@@ s@@ ory conf@@ li@@ ct .
It &apos;s getting mes@@ sa@@ ges from vision saying the ph@@ an@@ tom is back .
"On the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ oc@@ ep@@ tion , m@@ us@@ cle sig@@ n@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your mot@@ or comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this conf@@ li@@ ct , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ tom , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of d@@ eni@@ al — it g@@ ates the sig@@ n@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s , the b@@ on@@ us is , the pa@@ in dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s because you can &apos;t have di@@ sem@@ bod@@ i@@ ed pa@@ in flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the b@@ on@@ us ."
"Now , this tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e has been tri@@ ed on do@@ z@@ ens of patients by other grou@@ ps in H@@ el@@ sin@@ ki , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a tre@@ at@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ tom pa@@ in , and inde@@ ed , people have tri@@ ed it for stro@@ ke re@@ h@@ abil@@ it@@ ation ."
"S@@ tro@@ ke you norm@@ ally think of as dam@@ age to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some com@@ pon@@ ent of stro@@ ke par@@ al@@ ys@@ is is also learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and maybe that com@@ pon@@ ent can be over@@ come using mir@@ ro@@ r@@ s ."
"This has also gone through cl@@ in@@ ical tri@@ als , hel@@ ping lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me sw@@ it@@ ch g@@ ear@@ s now to the third part of my talk , which is about another cu@@ ri@@ ous ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called sy@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
This was discover@@ ed by Fran@@ c@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the n@@ in@@ et@@ e@@ ent@@ h century .
He was a cou@@ s@@ in of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely norm@@ al , had the fol@@ lo@@ wing pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s col@@ o@@ red ."
"F@@ i@@ ve is bl@@ ue , se@@ ven is y@@ el@@ low , e@@ ight is ch@@ ar@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is indi@@ go , OK ?"
"B@@ e@@ ar in mind , these people are completely norm@@ al in other re@@ spe@@ c@@ ts ."
"O@@ r C shar@@ p — sometimes , t@@ ones e@@ vo@@ ke col@@ or ."
"@@ C shar@@ p is bl@@ ue , F shar@@ p is gre@@ en , another t@@ one might be y@@ el@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called sy@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia . G@@ al@@ ton called it sy@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia , a min@@ gl@@ ing of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dist@@ in@@ ct ."
These people mu@@ d@@ dle up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ pe@@ c@@ ts of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia ru@@ ns in famili@@ es , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a her@@ ed@@ it@@ ary bas@@ is , a genet@@ ic bas@@ is ."
"Se@@ con@@ dly , sy@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the ma@@ in them@@ e of this le@@ c@@ ture , which is about cre@@ ativ@@ ity — sy@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia is e@@ ight times more common am@@ ong arti@@ sts , po@@ ets , nov@@ el@@ ist@@ s and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia ? What cau@@ ses it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ ories ."
One the@@ ory is they &apos;re just c@@ raz@@ y .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scienti@@ fic the@@ ory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther the@@ ory is they are ac@@ id ju@@ n@@ ki@@ es and po@@ the@@ ads , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tru@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an D@@ i@@ ego ."
"( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third the@@ ory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia . All right ?"
"So , we found that the col@@ or area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tal c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing between col@@ or and num@@ bers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be c@@ ros@@ sed wi@@ res in some people ?
R@@ em@@ ember I said it ru@@ ns in famili@@ es ?
That gi@@ ves you the clu@@ e .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ norm@@ al gen@@ e , a mu@@ t@@ ation in the gen@@ e that cau@@ ses this ab@@ norm@@ al c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain regi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other regi@@ on , and these are tri@@ m@@ med down to create the charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ic mo@@ du@@ la@@ r ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ture of the a@@ du@@ l@@ t brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e cau@@ sing this tri@@ m@@ ming and if that gen@@ e mu@@ tates , then you get def@@ ici@@ ent tri@@ m@@ ming between ad@@ ja@@ c@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and col@@ or , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ col@@ or sy@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and col@@ or , you get ton@@ e-@@ col@@ or sy@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pres@@ sed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ conne@@ cted ?"
"Well , think about what arti@@ sts , nov@@ el@@ ist@@ s and po@@ ets have in common , the ability to eng@@ age in met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking , lin@@ king se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly un@@ rel@@ ated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the e@@ ast , and Ju@@ li@@ et is the Su@@ n . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Ju@@ li@@ et is the su@@ n , does that mean she &apos;s a g@@ lo@@ wing b@@ all of fi@@ re ?"
"I mean , sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ eni@@ cs do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"N@@ or@@ m@@ al people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the su@@ n , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the su@@ n , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the su@@ n ."
"In@@ stan@@ tly , you &apos;ve found the lin@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this gre@@ ater c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing and conc@@ ep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a gre@@ ater pro@@ pen@@ s@@ ity to@@ wards met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking and cre@@ ativ@@ ity in people with sy@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
"And , h@@ ence , the e@@ ight times more common in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence of sy@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia am@@ ong po@@ ets , arti@@ sts and nov@@ el@@ ist@@ s ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ ren@@ olog@@ ical view of sy@@ nes@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
The last demon@@ str@@ ation — can I take one minut@@ e ?
"( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all sy@@ nes@@ th@@ et@@ es , but you &apos;re in d@@ eni@@ al about it ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s what I call Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et . Ju@@ st like your al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent sh@@ ap@@ es for different ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , right ?"
"H@@ ere , you &apos;ve got Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et ."
"One of them is K@@ i@@ ki , one of them is B@@ ou@@ ba ."
Wh@@ ich one is K@@ i@@ ki and which one is B@@ ou@@ ba ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ i@@ ki and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ ba ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two mu@@ tan@@ ts ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ ba , that &apos;s K@@ i@@ ki ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands ."
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ n@@ ine percent of you .
"Now , no@@ ne of you is a Mar@@ ti@@ an . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ model sy@@ nes@@ th@@ et@@ ic ab@@ stra@@ ction , me@@ an@@ ing you &apos;re saying that that shar@@ p inf@@ le@@ ction — ki@@ -@@ ki , in your au@@ dit@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x , the ha@@ ir cells being exc@@ ited — K@@ i@@ ki , m@@ im@@ ics the vis@@ ual inf@@ le@@ ction , sud@@ den inf@@ le@@ ction of that ja@@ gg@@ ed sh@@ ape ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is eng@@ ag@@ ing in a pri@@ m@@ itive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a sil@@ ly il@@ lu@@ sion , but these ph@@ ot@@ ons in your e@@ ye are doing this sh@@ ape , and ha@@ ir cells in your e@@ ar are exc@@ iting the au@@ dit@@ ory patter@@ n , but the brain is able to extra@@ ct the common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator ."
"It &apos;s a pri@@ m@@ itive form of ab@@ stra@@ ction , and we now know this happens in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s of the brain , because when that &apos;s dam@@ ag@@ ed , these people lo@@ se the ability to eng@@ age in B@@ ou@@ ba K@@ i@@ ki , but they also lo@@ se the ability to eng@@ age in met@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that gl@@ it@@ ters is not g@@ old , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The pati@@ ent says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s met@@ al@@ li@@ c and sh@@ iny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s g@@ old ."
"You have to meas@@ ure its speci@@ fic g@@ rav@@ ity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely mis@@ s the met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical me@@ an@@ ing ."
"So , this area is about e@@ ight times the size in high@@ er — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in humans — as in lo@@ wer pri@@ mat@@ es ."
"S@@ om@@ e@@ thing very interesting is going on here in the ang@@ ul@@ ar g@@ y@@ ru@@ s , because it &apos;s the c@@ ros@@ s@@ ro@@ ads between hear@@ ing , vision and tou@@ ch , and it became en@@ or@@ m@@ ous in humans . And something very interesting is going on ."
"And I think it &apos;s a bas@@ is of many uni@@ qu@@ ely human abil@@ ities like ab@@ stra@@ ction , met@@ ap@@ h@@ or and cre@@ ativ@@ ity ."
"A@@ ll of these questions that ph@@ il@@ oso@@ ph@@ ers have been stud@@ ying for mil@@ len@@ ni@@ a , we scientists can beg@@ in to expl@@ ore by doing brain imag@@ ing , and by stud@@ ying patients and as@@ king the right questions ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) S@@ or@@ ry about that .

This story is about taking imag@@ in@@ ation seri@@ ously .
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I first en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed this ordin@@ ary material , fi@@ sh@@ net , used the same way for cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es ."
"T@@ oday , I &apos;m using it to create per@@ man@@ ent , bil@@ lo@@ wing , vol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous form@@ s the scale of har@@ d-@@ ed@@ g@@ ed buil@@ din@@ gs in cities around the world ."
I was an un@@ lik@@ ely person to be doing this .
"I never studi@@ ed s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture , engine@@ ering or ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ture ."
"In fact , after colle@@ ge I app@@ li@@ ed to se@@ ven art scho@@ ols and was re@@ jec@@ ted by all se@@ ven ."
"I went off on my own to become an art@@ ist , and I pain@@ ted for 10 years , when I was off@@ er@@ ed a F@@ ul@@ b@@ right to India ."
"P@@ ro@@ mis@@ ing to give ex@@ hi@@ b@@ itions of pain@@ tin@@ gs , I shi@@ pped my pain@@ ts and ar@@ ri@@ ved in Ma@@ h@@ ab@@ ali@@ pu@@ ra@@ m ."
The de@@ a@@ dl@@ ine for the show ar@@ ri@@ ved — my pain@@ ts didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fi@@ sh@@ ing v@@ ill@@ age was fam@@ ous for s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture .
So I tri@@ ed b@@ ron@@ ze c@@ ast@@ ing .
But to make large form@@ s was too he@@ av@@ y and ex@@ pen@@ sive .
"I went for a walk on the be@@ ach , wat@@ ching the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men bu@@ n@@ dle their n@@ ets into m@@ oun@@ ds on the s@@ and ."
"I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differ@@ ently — a new appro@@ ach to s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture , a way to make vol@@ um@@ et@@ ri@@ c form without he@@ av@@ y sol@@ id materi@@ als ."
My first s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ ying s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture was made in col@@ labor@@ ation with these fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men .
It &apos;s a self-@@ por@@ tra@@ it t@@ it@@ led &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ de H@@ i@@ ps . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We ho@@ ist@@ ed them on pol@@ es to photogra@@ ph .
I discover@@ ed their so@@ ft sur@@ fac@@ es re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed every ri@@ p@@ ple of w@@ ind in con@@ stan@@ tly chang@@ ing patter@@ ns .
I was mes@@ mer@@ iz@@ ed .
"I contin@@ u@@ ed stud@@ ying cra@@ ft trad@@ itions and col@@ labor@@ ating with art@@ is@@ ans , next in Li@@ th@@ u@@ ani@@ a with l@@ ace mak@@ ers ."
"I li@@ ked the f@@ ine det@@ a@@ il it gave my work , but I wanted to make them lar@@ ger — to shi@@ ft from being an ob@@ ject you look at to something you could get lost in ."
"R@@ et@@ ur@@ ning to India to work with those fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men , we made a net of a million and a half han@@ d-@@ ti@@ ed k@@ not@@ s — inst@@ all@@ ed bri@@ ef@@ ly in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d ."
"Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds of people saw it , and one of them was the ur@@ ban@@ ist M@@ an@@ ual S@@ ol@@ a-@@ M@@ or@@ al@@ es who was re@@ desig@@ ning the wat@@ er@@ front in P@@ or@@ to , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al ."
He asked if I could build this as a per@@ man@@ ent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and pre@@ ser@@ ve my art .
"D@@ u@@ ra@@ ble , engine@@ er@@ ed , per@@ man@@ ent — those are in op@@ pos@@ ition to i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ c@@ r@@ atic , del@@ ic@@ ate and e@@ ph@@ em@@ er@@ al ."
"For two years , I sear@@ ched for a fi@@ ber that could survi@@ ve ul@@ tra@@ viol@@ et ra@@ ys , s@@ al@@ t , air , pol@@ lu@@ tion , and at the same time re@@ ma@@ in so@@ ft enough to move f@@ lu@@ id@@ ly in the w@@ ind ."
We needed something to h@@ old the net up out there in the middle of the tra@@ f@@ fic cir@@ cle .
"So we ra@@ is@@ ed this 4@@ 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ po@@ u@@ nd ste@@ el r@@ ing ."
We had to engine@@ er it to move gra@@ c@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly in an aver@@ age bre@@ ez@@ e and survi@@ ve in h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e win@@ ds .
But there was no engine@@ ering so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to model something po@@ rou@@ s and moving .
I found a br@@ illi@@ ant a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ ti@@ cal engine@@ er who desig@@ ns sa@@ il@@ s for America &apos;s C@@ up rac@@ ing y@@ ach@@ ts na@@ med P@@ et@@ er H@@ ep@@ pe@@ l .
He hel@@ ped me ta@@ ck@@ le the tw@@ in chall@@ eng@@ es of pre@@ ci@@ se sh@@ ape and g@@ ent@@ le movement .
I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because han@@ d-@@ ti@@ ed k@@ not@@ s wer@@ en &apos;t going to with@@ stand a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e .
"So I develop@@ ed a relation@@ ship with an industri@@ al fi@@ sh@@ net fac@@ tory , learned the vari@@ ab@@ les of their mach@@ ines , and fi@@ gu@@ red out a way to make l@@ ace with them ."
"There was no language to tran@@ sl@@ ate this an@@ ci@@ ent , i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ c@@ r@@ atic han@@ d@@ cra@@ ft into something machine oper@@ at@@ ors could produ@@ ce ."
So we had to create one .
"Th@@ ree years and two children later , we ra@@ is@@ ed this 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ squ@@ are@@ -@@ fo@@ ot l@@ ace net ."
"It was hard to believe that what I had imag@@ ined was now built , per@@ man@@ ent and had lost nothing in tran@@ sl@@ ation ."
( Applause ) This inter@@ se@@ ction had been bl@@ and and an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I wal@@ ked under@@ ne@@ ath it for the first time .
"As I wat@@ ched the w@@ ind &apos;s cho@@ re@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y un@@ f@@ old , I felt sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed and , at the same time , conne@@ cted to lim@@ it@@ less sk@@ y ."
My life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these o@@ ases of s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture in sp@@ ac@@ es of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share two direc@@ tions that are new in my work .
"H@@ istori@@ c P@@ h@@ il@@ a@@ del@@ ph@@ ia C@@ ity H@@ all : its pla@@ za , I felt , needed a material for s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture that was li@@ gh@@ ter than net@@ ting ."
"So we experim@@ ented with tiny atom@@ iz@@ ed water parti@@ cl@@ es to create a d@@ ry m@@ ist that is sh@@ ap@@ ed by the w@@ ind and in test@@ ing , discover@@ ed that it can be sh@@ ap@@ ed by people who can inter@@ act and move through it without getting w@@ et ."
I &apos;m using this s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture material to tra@@ ce the pa@@ ths of sub@@ way tra@@ ins ab@@ ov@@ e ground in real time — like an X@@ -@@ ra@@ y of the city &apos;s cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory system un@@ fol@@ ding .
"N@@ ex@@ t chall@@ enge , the Bi@@ en@@ ni@@ al of the Americ@@ as in D@@ en@@ ver asked , could I re@@ present the 3@@ 5 n@@ ations of the W@@ ester@@ n h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere and their inter@@ conne@@ c@@ te@@ d@@ ness in a s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ?"
"( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to beg@@ in , but I said yes ."
I read about the rec@@ ent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke in Ch@@ ile and the t@@ su@@ nami that ri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed across the entire P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic O@@ c@@ ean .
"It shi@@ f@@ ted the Earth &apos;s te@@ c@@ ton@@ ic plat@@ es , sp@@ ed up the planet &apos;s rot@@ ation and liter@@ ally shor@@ ten@@ ed the len@@ g@@ th of the day ."
"So I con@@ ta@@ cted N@@ O@@ A@@ A , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the t@@ su@@ nami , and tran@@ sl@@ ated it into this ."
I@@ ts t@@ it@@ le : &quot; &quot; 1@@ .@@ 2@@ 6 &quot; &quot; re@@ f@@ ers to the number of micro@@ secon@@ ds that the Earth &apos;s day was shor@@ ten@@ ed .
"I couldn &apos;t build this with a ste@@ el r@@ ing , the way I knew ."
I@@ ts sh@@ ape was too complex now .
"So I re@@ plac@@ ed the met@@ al ar@@ mat@@ ure with a so@@ ft , f@@ ine mes@@ h of a fi@@ ber 15 times stron@@ ger than ste@@ el ."
"The s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture could now be enti@@ rely so@@ ft , which made it so light it could ti@@ e in to exist@@ ing buil@@ din@@ gs — liter@@ ally be@@ coming part of the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the city ."
There was no so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that could ex@@ tru@@ de these complex net form@@ s and model them with g@@ rav@@ ity .
So we had to create it .
Th@@ en I got a call from New York C@@ ity as@@ king if I could ada@@ pt these conc@@ ep@@ ts to T@@ imes S@@ qu@@ are or the H@@ igh L@@ ine .
This new so@@ ft struc@@ tu@@ ral me@@ th@@ od en@@ ab@@ les me to model these and build these s@@ cul@@ p@@ tures at the scale of sk@@ y@@ sc@@ ra@@ per@@ s .
"They don &apos;t have fun@@ ding yet , but I dre@@ am now of br@@ ing@@ ing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed ."
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I sear@@ ched for beau@@ ty in the trad@@ iti@@ onal things , in cra@@ ft form@@ s ."
"Now I com@@ b@@ ine them with hi@@ -@@ te@@ ch materi@@ als and engine@@ ering to create vol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous , bil@@ lo@@ wing form@@ s the scale of buil@@ din@@ gs ."
My arti@@ st@@ ic hor@@ iz@@ ons contin@@ ue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x .
"A@@ n at@@ tor@@ ney in the off@@ ice who &apos;d never been interest@@ ed in art , never vis@@ ited the local art mu@@ se@@ um , dra@@ gg@@ ed everyone she could from the building and got them outside to li@@ e down under@@ ne@@ ath the s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ."
"There they were in their business su@@ its , la@@ ying in the g@@ ras@@ s , not@@ ic@@ ing the chang@@ ing patter@@ ns of w@@ ind bes@@ i@@ de people they didn &apos;t know , shar@@ ing the red@@ is@@ c@@ over@@ y of won@@ der ."

The way to read this sli@@ de is to look at your age on the hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal a@@ x@@ is .
"A@@ f@@ ter pu@@ ber@@ ty , we f@@ all off the ma@@ p ."
She &apos;s a si@@ x@@ -@@ mon@@ ther .
( Applause )
So when I was a ki@@ d ...
this was my team .
( Laughter ) I st@@ un@@ k at s@@ por@@ ts .
"I didn &apos;t like to play them , I didn &apos;t like to wat@@ ch them ."
So this is what I did . I went fi@@ sh@@ ing .
"And for all of my gro@@ wing up I fi@@ shed on the sho@@ res of Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ c@@ ut , and these are the cre@@ at@@ ures that I saw on a regul@@ ar bas@@ is ."
"But after I gre@@ w up and went to colle@@ ge , and I came home in the early 9@@ 0 &apos;s , this is what I found ."
My team had sh@@ ru@@ n@@ k .
It was like liter@@ ally having your rost@@ er de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
"And as I sort of looked into that , from a very pers@@ onal point of view as a fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man , I started to kind of figure out , well , what was the re@@ st of the world thinking about it ?"
F@@ i@@ rst place I started to look was fish mark@@ ets .
"And when I went to fish mark@@ ets , in sp@@ ite of where I was — whether I was in Nor@@ th C@@ a@@ ro@@ l@@ ina , or Par@@ is , or Lon@@ don , or wh@@ er@@ ever — I k@@ ept seeing this we@@ ir@@ dly re@@ pe@@ ating tro@@ pe of four cre@@ at@@ ures , again and again — on the men@@ us , on ice — sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , tu@@ na , s@@ al@@ mon and c@@ od ."
"And I thought this was pretty stran@@ ge , and as I looked at it , I was wonder@@ ing , did any@@ one else not@@ ice this sort of sh@@ rin@@ king of the market ?"
"Well , when I looked into it , I realized that people didn &apos;t look at it as their team ."
"O@@ r@@ din@@ ary people , the way they looked at se@@ a@@ food was like this ."
It &apos;s not an un@@ u@@ su@@ al human charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ic to re@@ du@@ ce the natural world down to very few ele@@ ments .

"If you look at fi@@ re p@@ its from 1@@ 0,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see rac@@ co@@ ons , you &apos;ll see , you know , w@@ ol@@ ves , you &apos;ll see all kinds of different cre@@ at@@ ures ."
"It &apos;s true of bir@@ ds , too ."
"You look at the men@@ us in New York C@@ ity re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts 1@@ 50 years ago , 2@@ 00 years ago , you &apos;ll see sni@@ pe , wo@@ od@@ co@@ ck , grou@@ se , do@@ z@@ ens of duc@@ ks , do@@ z@@ ens of ge@@ ese ."
"But tel@@ es@@ c@@ op@@ e a@@ head to the age of mo@@ der@@ n anim@@ al h@@ us@@ ban@@ d@@ ry , and you &apos;ll see four : tur@@ ke@@ ys , duc@@ ks , ch@@ ick@@ en and ge@@ ese ."
So it makes sense that we &apos;ve he@@ ad@@ ed in this direc@@ tion .
But how have we he@@ ad@@ ed in this direc@@ tion ?
Well ...
"@@ first it &apos;s a very , very new problem ."
Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I was a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous in@@ c@@ enti@@ ve to ar@@ m ourselves in a war against fish .
"A@@ ll of the technology that we perf@@ ec@@ ted during Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I — s@@ on@@ ar , li@@ gh@@ t@@ we@@ ight pol@@ y@@ mer@@ s — all these things were re@@ direc@@ ted to@@ wards fish ."
"And so you see this tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous buil@@ du@@ p in fi@@ sh@@ ing cap@@ ac@@ ity , qu@@ a@@ dru@@ pl@@ ing in the course of time , from the end of Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I to the present time ."
And right now that means we &apos;re taking between 80 and 9@@ 0 million met@@ ri@@ c t@@ ons out of the se@@ a every year .
That &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the human we@@ ight of China taken out of the se@@ a every year .
And it &apos;s no co@@ in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence that I use China as the example because China is now the lar@@ g@@ est fi@@ sh@@ ing n@@ ation in the world .
"Well , that &apos;s only half the story ."
"The other half of the story is this incredi@@ ble bo@@ om in fish far@@ ming and a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , which is now , only in the last year or two , star@@ ting to exc@@ e@@ ed the amount of w@@ il@@ d fish that we produ@@ ce ."
"So that if you ad@@ d w@@ il@@ d fish and far@@ med fish together , you get the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of two Ch@@ in@@ as created from the ocean each and every year ."
"And again , it &apos;s not a co@@ in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence that I use China as the example , because China , in add@@ ition to being the bi@@ gg@@ est cat@@ ch@@ er of fish , is also the bi@@ gg@@ est far@@ mer of fish ."
So let &apos;s look though at the four cho@@ ices we are making right now .
"The first one — by far the most con@@ sum@@ ed se@@ a@@ food in America and in much of the W@@ est , is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p ."
Sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p in the w@@ il@@ d — as a w@@ il@@ d produc@@ t — is a ter@@ ri@@ ble produc@@ t .
"@@ 5 , 10 , 15 po@@ un@@ ds of w@@ il@@ d fish are regul@@ arly kill@@ ed to bring one po@@ u@@ nd of sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p to the market ."
They &apos;re also incredi@@ bly fu@@ el in@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent to bring to the market .
"In a rec@@ ent study that was produc@@ ed out of D@@ al@@ hou@@ si@@ e Uni@@ vers@@ ity , it was found that dra@@ gg@@ ing for sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p is one of the most car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive ways of fi@@ sh@@ ing that you can find ."
"So you can far@@ m them , and people do far@@ m them , and they far@@ m them a lot in this very area ."
Pro@@ bl@@ em is ...
the place where you far@@ m sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p is in these w@@ il@@ d h@@ ab@@ it@@ ats — in man@@ gro@@ ve fore@@ sts .
Now look at those lov@@ ely ro@@ ots coming down .
"Th@@ ose are the things that h@@ old so@@ il together , prote@@ ct co@@ ast@@ s , create h@@ ab@@ it@@ ats for all sor@@ ts of young fish , young sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , all sor@@ ts of things that are important to this environment ."
"Well , this is what happens to a lot of co@@ ast@@ al man@@ gro@@ ve fore@@ sts ."
"That rate of dest@@ ru@@ ction has slo@@ wed , but we &apos;re still in a maj@@ or man@@ gro@@ ve de@@ fic@@ it ."
"The other thing that &apos;s going on here is a ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on that the fil@@ m@@ mak@@ er Mar@@ k B@@ en@@ ja@@ m@@ in called &quot; &quot; G@@ rin@@ ding N@@ em@@ o . &quot; &quot; This ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on is very , very re@@ lev@@ ant to anything that you &apos;ve ever seen on a tro@@ p@@ ical re@@ e@@ f ."
"Because what &apos;s going on right now , we have sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p dra@@ gg@@ ers dra@@ gg@@ ing for sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , cat@@ ching a huge amount of by@@ cat@@ ch , that by@@ cat@@ ch in turn gets ground up and turned into sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p food ."
So tu@@ na is this ul@@ tim@@ ate global fish .
These huge manag@@ ement are@@ as have to be ob@@ ser@@ ved in order for tu@@ na to be well manag@@ ed .
"The great nat@@ ur@@ al@@ ist C@@ ar@@ l S@@ a@@ fin@@ a once called it , &quot; The Inter@@ national Con@@ sp@@ ira@@ cy to C@@ at@@ ch all the T@@ u@@ nas . &quot;"
"O@@ f course we &apos;ve seen incredi@@ ble impro@@ ve@@ ment in I@@ C@@ C@@ A@@ T in the last few years , there is tot@@ al room for impro@@ ve@@ ment , but it re@@ ma@@ ins to be said that tu@@ na is a global fish , and to man@@ age it , we have to man@@ age the glob@@ e ."
"Well , we could also try to grow tu@@ na but tu@@ na is a spe@@ c@@ ta@@ cul@@ arly bad anim@@ al for a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture ."
M@@ any people don &apos;t know this but tu@@ na are war@@ m@@ -@@ blo@@ od@@ ed .
"They can he@@ at their bod@@ ies 20 de@@ gre@@ es ab@@ ov@@ e am@@ bi@@ ent temper@@ ature , they can sw@@ im at over 40 mil@@ es an h@@ our ."
"So that pretty much el@@ im@@ in@@ ates all the adv@@ anta@@ ges of far@@ ming a fish , right ?"
"A far@@ med fish is — or a fish is col@@ d-@@ blo@@ od@@ ed , it doesn &apos;t move too much ."
That &apos;s a great thing for gro@@ wing prote@@ in .
"But if you &apos;ve got this c@@ raz@@ y , w@@ il@@ d cre@@ ature that sw@@ im@@ s at 40 mil@@ es an h@@ our and he@@ ats its blo@@ od — not a great can@@ di@@ d@@ ate for a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture ."
The next cre@@ ature — most con@@ sum@@ ed se@@ a@@ food in America and throu@@ gh@@ out the W@@ est — is s@@ al@@ mon .
"Now s@@ al@@ mon got its pl@@ under@@ ing , too , but it didn &apos;t really ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily happen through fi@@ sh@@ ing ."
This is my home state of Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ c@@ ut .
Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ c@@ ut used to be home to a lot of w@@ il@@ d s@@ al@@ mon .
"But if you look at this ma@@ p of Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ c@@ ut , every do@@ t on that ma@@ p is a da@@ m ."
"There are over 3@@ ,000 dam@@ s in the state of Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ c@@ ut ."
"I often say this is why people in Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ c@@ ut are so up@@ ti@@ ght — ( Laughter ) If somebody could just un@@ blo@@ ck Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ c@@ ut &apos;s chi , I feel that we could have an in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely better world ."
"But I made this particular com@@ ment at a con@@ ven@@ tion once of national par@@ ks off@@ ic@@ ers , and this guy from Nor@@ th C@@ a@@ ro@@ l@@ ina si@@ dl@@ ed up to me , he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you ou@@ gh@@ t@@ n &apos;t be so hard on your Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ c@@ ut , c@@ ause we here in Nor@@ th C@@ a@@ ro@@ l@@ ina , we got 3@@ 5@@ ,000 dam@@ s . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s a national ep@@ ide@@ mic , it &apos;s an inter@@ national ep@@ ide@@ mic ."
"And there are dam@@ s every@@ where , and these are pre@@ c@@ is@@ ely the things that stop w@@ il@@ d s@@ al@@ mon from re@@ ach@@ ing their spa@@ w@@ ning gro@@ un@@ ds ."
"So as a resul@@ t , we &apos;ve turned to a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , and s@@ al@@ mon is one the most succ@@ ess@@ ful , at least from a num@@ bers point of view ."
"When they first started far@@ ming s@@ al@@ mon , it could take as many as six po@@ un@@ ds of w@@ il@@ d fish to make a single po@@ u@@ nd of s@@ al@@ mon ."
"The indu@@ stry has , to its cre@@ dit , gre@@ at@@ ly impro@@ ved ."
Th@@ ose p@@ ell@@ ets are in turn re@@ duc@@ ed fish .
"So the ac@@ tual — what &apos;s called the F@@ I@@ F@@ O , the fish in and the fish out — kind of hard to say ."
"But in any case , cre@@ dit to the indu@@ stry , it has lo@@ wer@@ ed the amount of fish per po@@ u@@ nd of s@@ al@@ mon ."
Pro@@ bl@@ em is we &apos;ve also gone c@@ raz@@ y with the amount of s@@ al@@ mon that we &apos;re produc@@ ing .
A@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture is the f@@ ast@@ est gro@@ wing food system on the planet .
It &apos;s gro@@ wing at something like se@@ ven percent per year .
"And so even though we &apos;re doing less per fish to bring it to the market , we &apos;re still kill@@ ing a lot of these little fish ."
"And it &apos;s not just fish that we &apos;re fe@@ ed@@ ing fish to , we &apos;re also fe@@ ed@@ ing fish to ch@@ ick@@ ens and p@@ ig@@ s ."
"So we &apos;ve got ch@@ ick@@ ens and they &apos;re e@@ ating fish , but we@@ ir@@ dly , we also have fish that are e@@ ating ch@@ ick@@ ens ."
"Because the by@@ produc@@ ts of ch@@ ick@@ ens — fe@@ a@@ thers , blo@@ od , b@@ one — get ground up and f@@ ed to fish ."
"So I often won@@ der , is there a fish that ate a ch@@ ick@@ en that ate a fish ?"
"It &apos;s sort of a re@@ working of the ch@@ ick@@ en and eg@@ g thing . A@@ ny@@ way — ( Laughter ) All together , though , it resul@@ ts in a ter@@ ri@@ ble m@@ ess ."
What you &apos;re talking about is something between 20 and 30 million met@@ ri@@ c t@@ ons of w@@ il@@ d cre@@ at@@ ures that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up .
"That &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a third of a China , or of an entire United States of humans that &apos;s taken out of the se@@ a each and every year ."
The last of the four is a kind of am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous thing .
"It &apos;s what the indu@@ stry call@@ s &quot; &quot; wh@@ it@@ ef@@ ish . &quot; &quot; There are many fish that get cy@@ cl@@ ed into this wh@@ it@@ ef@@ ish thing but the way to kind of tell the story , I think , is through that clas@@ sic piece of American cul@@ in@@ ary innov@@ ation , the F@@ ilet@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ ish san@@ d@@ w@@ ich ."
So the F@@ ilet@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ ish san@@ d@@ w@@ ich actually started as h@@ ali@@ but .
"Because it was a C@@ a@@ th@@ ol@@ ic community , they needed fish ."
"So he went to R@@ ay K@@ ro@@ c and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to bring you a fish san@@ d@@ w@@ ich , going to be made out of h@@ ali@@ but . &quot;"
"But let &apos;s do this , let &apos;s have a b@@ et ."
"W@@ ho@@ se@@ ver san@@ d@@ w@@ ich sel@@ ls more , that will be the win@@ ning san@@ d@@ w@@ ich . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s kind of sa@@ d for the ocean that the H@@ ul@@ a B@@ ur@@ ger didn &apos;t w@@ in ."
So he made his h@@ ali@@ but san@@ d@@ w@@ ich .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately though , the san@@ d@@ w@@ ich came in at 30 c@@ ents ."
"R@@ ay wanted the san@@ d@@ w@@ ich to come in at 25 c@@ ents , so he turned to A@@ t@@ lan@@ ti@@ c c@@ od ."
We all know what happened to A@@ t@@ lan@@ ti@@ c c@@ od in New En@@ gl@@ and .
"So now the F@@ ilet@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ ish san@@ d@@ w@@ ich is made out of Al@@ as@@ ka pol@@ lo@@ ck , it &apos;s the lar@@ g@@ est f@@ in fish fi@@ sh@@ ery in the United States , 2 to 3 billion po@@ un@@ ds of fish taken out of the se@@ a every single year ."
"If we go through the pol@@ lo@@ ck , the next cho@@ ice is probably going to be t@@ il@@ ap@@ ia ."
T@@ il@@ ap@@ ia is one of those fish no@@ body ever heard of 20 years ago .
"It &apos;s actually a very eff@@ ici@@ ent con@@ ver@@ ter of plant prote@@ in into anim@@ al prote@@ in , and it &apos;s been a god@@ sen@@ d to the third world ."
So what do we do ?
"I mean , first of all , what about this po@@ or fish , the clu@@ pe@@ i@@ ds ?"
The fish that re@@ present a huge part of that 20 to 30 million met@@ ri@@ c t@@ ons .
"Well , one pos@@ sibil@@ ity that a lot of con@@ ser@@ v@@ ation@@ ist@@ s have ra@@ is@@ ed is could we e@@ at them ?"
C@@ ould we e@@ at them direc@@ tly instead of fe@@ ed@@ ing them to s@@ al@@ mon ?
There are argu@@ ments for it .
"They are tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously fu@@ el eff@@ ici@@ ent to bring to market , a fra@@ ction of the fu@@ el cost of say , sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , and at the very top of the car@@ b@@ on eff@@ ici@@ en@@ cy scale ."
"They also are om@@ e@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 ri@@ ch , a great sour@@ ce for E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A ."
So that is a pot@@ ential .
"And if we were to go down that ro@@ ute what I would say is , instead of pa@@ ying a few bu@@ cks a po@@ u@@ nd — or a few bu@@ cks a ton , really — and making it into a@@ qu@@ a@@ fe@@ ed , could we hal@@ ve the cat@@ ch and d@@ ou@@ ble the pri@@ ce for the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men and make that our way of tre@@ ating these particular fish ?"
"O@@ ther pos@@ sibil@@ ity though , which is much more interesting , is looking at bi@@ val@@ ves , particul@@ arly m@@ us@@ sel@@ s ."
"Now , m@@ us@@ sel@@ s are very high in E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A , they &apos;re si@@ mil@@ ar to can@@ ned tu@@ na ."
They &apos;re also ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely fu@@ el eff@@ ici@@ ent .
T@@ o bring a po@@ u@@ nd of m@@ us@@ sel@@ s to market is about a th@@ ir@@ ti@@ et@@ h of the car@@ b@@ on as re@@ qui@@ red to bring be@@ e@@ f to market .
"They re@@ qui@@ re no for@@ age fish , they actually get their om@@ e@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s by fil@@ ter@@ ing the water of micro@@ al@@ ga@@ e ."
"In fact , that &apos;s where om@@ e@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s come from , they don &apos;t come from fish ."
"M@@ ic@@ ro@@ al@@ ga@@ e make the om@@ e@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s , they &apos;re only bi@@ o@@ con@@ cent@@ rat@@ ed in fish ."
M@@ us@@ sel@@ s and other bi@@ val@@ ves do tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous amoun@@ ts of water fil@@ tr@@ ation .
A single m@@ us@@ se@@ l can fil@@ ter do@@ z@@ ens of g@@ all@@ ons every single day .
And this is incredi@@ bly important when we look at the world .
"R@@ ight now , nit@@ ri@@ fic@@ ation , over@@ use of p@@ hosp@@ h@@ ates in our wat@@ er@@ ways are cau@@ sing tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous al@@ g@@ al blo@@ om@@ s ."
"O@@ ver 4@@ 00 new de@@ ad z@@ ones have been created in the last 20 years , tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sour@@ ces of mar@@ ine life de@@ ath ."
We also could look at not a fish at all .
They fil@@ ter the water just like m@@ us@@ sel@@ s do .
"And we@@ ir@@ dly enough , it turns out that you can actually fe@@ ed this to co@@ ws ."
"Now , I &apos;m not a big f@@ an of cat@@ tle ."
"But if you wanted to keep gro@@ wing cat@@ tle in a time and place where water resour@@ ces are lim@@ ited , you &apos;re gro@@ wing se@@ a@@ we@@ ed in the water , you don &apos;t have to water it — maj@@ or consi@@ der@@ ation ."
And the last fish is a question mar@@ k .
We have the ability to create a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ tu@@ red fish that cre@@ ates a net ga@@ in of mar@@ ine prote@@ in for us .
This exist@@ s kind of on pa@@ per .
I have been re@@ por@@ ting on these sub@@ jects for 15 years .
"E@@ very time I do a new story , somebody tel@@ ls me , &quot; &quot; We can do all that . We can do it . We &apos;ve fi@@ gu@@ red it all out ."
We can produ@@ ce a fish that &apos;s a net ga@@ in of mar@@ ine prote@@ in and has om@@ e@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s . &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at .
It doesn &apos;t se@@ em to be getting sc@@ al@@ ed up .
It is time to scale this up .
"If we do , 30 million met@@ ri@@ c t@@ ons of se@@ a@@ food , a third of the world cat@@ ch , sta@@ ys in the water ."
So I gu@@ ess what I &apos;m saying is this is what we &apos;ve been going with .
We t@@ end to go with our app@@ et@@ it@@ es rather than our min@@ ds .
"But if we went with this , or some con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation of it , we might have a little more of this ."
Thank you .
