"When I was 11 , I remember wa@@ king up one mor@@ ning to the sound of jo@@ y in my house ."
"My father was list@@ ening to B@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws on his small , gra@@ y radi@@ o ."
"There was a big sm@@ ile on his face which was un@@ u@@ su@@ al then , because the news mo@@ st@@ ly depres@@ sed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an and made it il@@ leg@@ al for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I d@@ res@@ sed as a bo@@ y to es@@ cor@@ t my ol@@ der sist@@ er , who was no longer allo@@ wed to be outside alone , to a se@@ cre@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be educ@@ ated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different ro@@ ute so that no one would su@@ spe@@ ct where we were going ."
We would c@@ over our bo@@ oks in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would se@@ em we were just out sh@@ op@@ ping .
"The school was in a house , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small living room ."
It was co@@ zy in win@@ ter but ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely ho@@ t in sum@@ mer .
"We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the teach@@ er , the students and our parents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would sud@@ den@@ ly be can@@ c@@ el@@ ed for a week because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were su@@ sp@@ ici@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being fol@@ lo@@ wed ?
Do they know where we live ?
"We were sc@@ a@@ red , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very lu@@ ck@@ y to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ z@@ ed and d@@ augh@@ ters were tre@@ as@@ u@@ red .
My gran@@ d@@ father was an extra@@ ordin@@ ary man for his time .
"A tot@@ al m@@ aver@@ ick from a rem@@ ot@@ e pro@@ vin@@ ce of A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an , he in@@ sist@@ ed that his d@@ aughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was dis@@ ow@@ ned by his father ."
But my educ@@ ated mother became a teach@@ er .
There she is .
"S@@ he re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for gir@@ ls and women in our ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to rec@@ ei@@ ve an education .
"There was no question that his children would rec@@ ei@@ ve an education , inclu@@ ding his d@@ augh@@ ters , des@@ p@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , des@@ p@@ ite the ri@@ sk@@ s ."
"To him , there was gre@@ ater risk in not educ@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ uring T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years , I remember there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ strat@@ ed by our life and always being sc@@ a@@ red and not seeing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , my d@@ aughter , you can lo@@ se everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be stol@@ en . You can be for@@ ced to leave your home during a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to s@@ ell our blo@@ od to p@@ ay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to contin@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; T@@ oday I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in a country that has been dest@@ ro@@ yed by dec@@ ad@@ es of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ y@@ ond high school , and had my family not been so comm@@ it@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"In@@ st@@ ead , I stand here a pro@@ u@@ d gradu@@ ate of M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ bu@@ ry C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ en I re@@ turned to A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an , my gran@@ d@@ father , the one ex@@ il@@ ed from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his d@@ augh@@ ters , was am@@ ong the first to con@@ g@@ rat@@ ul@@ ate me ."
"He not only bra@@ gs about my colle@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l ."
( Applause ) My family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ am@@ s even bi@@ g@@ ger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 1@@ 0@@ x@@ 10 , a global cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to educ@@ ate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for gir@@ ls in A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an , a country where it &apos;s still ri@@ sk@@ y for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
The exc@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with am@@ b@@ ition gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing at opport@@ unity .
"And I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate for them , des@@ p@@ ite and even in the face of d@@ au@@ n@@ ting op@@ pos@@ ition ."
"L@@ ike A@@ h@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I can@@ not show you his face , but A@@ h@@ med is the father of one of my students ."
"L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his d@@ aughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their v@@ ill@@ age , and they liter@@ ally mis@@ sed being kill@@ ed by a ro@@ ad@@ side b@@ om@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ ri@@ ved home , the phone ran@@ g , a vo@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he s@@ ent his d@@ aughter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my d@@ aughter &apos;s future because of your old and back@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realiz@@ e about A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an , and this is something that is often dis@@ mis@@ sed in the W@@ est , that behind most of us who succ@@ e@@ ed is a father who recogniz@@ es the val@@ ue in his d@@ aughter and who se@@ es that her succ@@ ess is his succ@@ ess ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mo@@ thers are@@ n &apos;t key in our succ@@ ess .
"In fact , they &apos;re often the in@@ iti@@ al and con@@ vin@@ cing ne@@ got@@ i@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their d@@ augh@@ ters , but in the con@@ text of a society like in A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an , we must have the sup@@ port of men ."
"U@@ n@@ der the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , gir@@ ls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hun@@ dre@@ ds — remember , it was il@@ leg@@ al ."
"But today , more than three million gir@@ ls are in school in A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an ."
( Applause ) A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americ@@ ans see the fra@@ g@@ il@@ ity in changes .
I fe@@ ar that these changes will not last much be@@ y@@ ond the U.@@ S. tro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an , when I see the students in my school and their parents who ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate for them , who en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge them , I see a pro@@ mis@@ ing future and la@@ st@@ ing change ."
"To me , A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an is a country of hope and b@@ oun@@ dl@@ ess pos@@ sibil@@ ities , and every single day the gir@@ ls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A rem@@ ind me of that ."
"L@@ ike me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
And you &apos;ll now see the y@@ ol@@ k and the white have se@@ par@@ ated .
And sli@@ gh@@ tly more complex things appe@@ ar .
That &apos;s tw@@ ice as long as humans have been on this planet .
"And de@@ ep ben@@ e@@ ath those oc@@ e@@ ans , at cra@@ cks in the Earth &apos;s c@@ ru@@ st , you &apos;ve got he@@ at se@@ ep@@ ing up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great di@@ vers@@ ity of ele@@ ments ."
"But of course , life is more than just ex@@ ot@@ ic chem@@ ist@@ ry ."
H@@ um@@ an be@@ ings start put@@ ting each other into bo@@ x@@ es the second that they see each other — I@@ s that person dan@@ ger@@ ous ? A@@ re they at@@ tra@@ ctive ?
A@@ re they a pot@@ ential m@@ ate ? A@@ re they a pot@@ ential net@@ working opport@@ unity ?
We do this little inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation when we me@@ et people to make a mental re@@ su@@ me for them .
What &apos;s your name ? Wh@@ ere are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Th@@ en we get more pers@@ onal with it .
H@@ ave you ever had any dise@@ ases ?
H@@ ave you ever been di@@ vor@@ ced ?
D@@ o@@ es your bre@@ ath sm@@ ell bad while you &apos;re ans@@ wer@@ ing my inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation right now ?
What are you into ? Wh@@ o are you into ?
What gen@@ der do you like to sle@@ ep with ?
I get it .
We are ne@@ uro@@ lo@@ g@@ ically har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to se@@ ek out people like ourselves .
We start form@@ ing c@@ li@@ qu@@ es as so@@ on as we &apos;re old enough to know what acc@@ ep@@ t@@ ance feel@@ s like .
"We b@@ ond together based on anything that we can — music pre@@ fer@@ ence , ra@@ ce , gen@@ der , the blo@@ ck that we gre@@ w up on ."
We se@@ ek out environ@@ ments that re@@ in@@ for@@ ce our pers@@ onal cho@@ ices .
"S@@ omet@@ imes , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s op@@ ening a tiny little bo@@ x and as@@ king you to squ@@ e@@ ez@@ e y@@ ourself inside of it ."
"Because the cat@@ eg@@ ories , I &apos;ve found , are too lim@@ iting ."
The bo@@ x@@ es are too nar@@ row .
And this can get really dan@@ ger@@ ous .
"So here &apos;s a disc@@ la@@ im@@ er about me , though , before we get too de@@ ep into this ."
I gre@@ w up in a very sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed environment .
"I was ra@@ is@@ ed in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ t@@ an in the early 19@@ 8@@ 0s , two blo@@ cks from the ep@@ ic@@ ent@@ er of p@@ un@@ k music ."
I was shi@@ el@@ ded from the pa@@ ins of bi@@ got@@ ry and the social re@@ stri@@ ctions of a religi@@ ou@@ sl@@ y-@@ based up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing .
"Wh@@ ere I come from , if you wer@@ en &apos;t a dra@@ g qu@@ e@@ en or a radi@@ cal thin@@ k@@ er or a per@@ form@@ ance art@@ ist of some kind , you were the we@@ ir@@ do ."
"( Laughter ) It was an u@@ nor@@ th@@ od@@ o@@ x up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing , but as a ki@@ d on the stre@@ ets of New York , you learn how to tru@@ st your own inst@@ in@@ c@@ ts , you learn how to go with your own ideas ."
"So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a bo@@ y ."
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play bas@@ k@@ et@@ b@@ all with them .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let gir@@ ls play .
"So I went home , and I sh@@ av@@ ed my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a bo@@ y . &quot; &quot; I mean , who kno@@ ws , right ?"
"When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that ."
"I didn &apos;t want any@@ one to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t ."
I k@@ ept up the cha@@ ra@@ de for e@@ ight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was pla@@ ying a ki@@ d na@@ med W@@ al@@ ter in a mo@@ vie called &quot; &quot; Ju@@ li@@ an P@@ o . &quot; &quot; I was a little stre@@ et t@@ ough that fol@@ lo@@ wed Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an S@@ later around and b@@ ad@@ ger@@ ed him .
"S@@ ee , I was also a child ac@@ tor , which d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed up the la@@ y@@ ers of the per@@ form@@ ance of my id@@ ent@@ ity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really pla@@ ying a bo@@ y ."
"In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teach@@ ers at school , not my friends , not the direc@@ tors that I worked with ."
K@@ i@@ ds would often come up to me in clas@@ s and gra@@ b me by the th@@ ro@@ at to ch@@ ec@@ k for an A@@ da@@ m &apos;s ap@@ ple or gra@@ b my c@@ rot@@ ch to ch@@ ec@@ k what I was working with .
"When I would go to the ba@@ th@@ room , I would turn my sho@@ es around in the st@@ all@@ s so that it looked like I was pe@@ eing standing up ."
A@@ t sle@@ e@@ pover@@ s I would have p@@ ani@@ c atta@@ cks trying to bre@@ ak it to gir@@ ls that they didn &apos;t want to k@@ is@@ s me without ou@@ ting myself .
It &apos;s wor@@ th men@@ tion@@ ing though that I didn &apos;t h@@ ate my body or my gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was per@@ form@@ ing this el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ed as trans@@ gen@@ der .
"If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in ther@@ ap@@ y , they probably would have diag@@ no@@ sed me as something like gen@@ der d@@ ys@@ mor@@ ph@@ ic and put me on hor@@ mon@@ es to stav@@ e off pu@@ ber@@ ty ."
"But in my particular case , I just wo@@ ke up one day when I was 1@@ 4 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again ."
"P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty had h@@ it , and I had no idea what being a girl me@@ ant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was ."
"When a ki@@ d behav@@ es like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?"
No one is exactly sho@@ c@@ ked .
( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to def@@ ine myself by my parents .
"When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had f@@ all@@ en in love , it was the last thing on ei@@ ther of our min@@ ds to disc@@ us@@ s what the con@@ sequ@@ ences were of the fact that my first love was a girl ."
"Th@@ ree years later , when I f@@ ell in love with a man , ne@@ i@@ ther of my parents bat@@ ted an e@@ y@@ el@@ ash ei@@ ther ."
"S@@ ee , it &apos;s one of the great bl@@ es@@ sin@@ gs of my very u@@ nor@@ th@@ od@@ o@@ x chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to def@@ ine myself as any one thing at any point ."
"I was just allo@@ wed to be me , gro@@ wing and chang@@ ing in every moment ."
"So four , almost five years ago , Pro@@ pos@@ ition 8 , the great mar@@ ri@@ age equ@@ ality de@@ b@@ ate , was ra@@ is@@ ing a lot of du@@ st around this country ."
"And at the time , getting mar@@ ri@@ ed wasn &apos;t really something I sp@@ ent a lot of time thinking about ."
"But I was stru@@ ck by the fact that America , a country with such a tar@@ ni@@ shed ci@@ vil ri@@ ghts recor@@ d , could be re@@ pe@@ ating its mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es so bl@@ at@@ an@@ tly ."
"And I remember wat@@ ching the disc@@ us@@ sion on tele@@ vision and thinking how interesting it was that the se@@ par@@ ation of ch@@ ur@@ ch and state was es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally dra@@ wing ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ical b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es throu@@ gh@@ out this country , between places where people beli@@ ev@@ ed in it and places where people didn &apos;t ."
"And then , that this disc@@ us@@ sion was dra@@ wing ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ical b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es around me ."
"If this was a war with two dis@@ par@@ ate sid@@ es , I , by def@@ au@@ l@@ t , f@@ ell on team g@@ ay , because I cer@@ tain@@ ly wasn &apos;t 100 percent stra@@ ight ."
"A@@ t the time I was just beginning to em@@ er@@ ge from this ei@@ gh@@ t-@@ year pers@@ onal id@@ ent@@ ity cri@@ s@@ is z@@ ig@@ za@@ g that saw me go from being a bo@@ y to being this aw@@ k@@ ward girl that looked like a bo@@ y in girl &apos;s clo@@ th@@ es to the op@@ pos@@ ite ex@@ tre@@ me of this su@@ per sk@@ imp@@ y , over@@ -@@ comp@@ en@@ s@@ ating , bo@@ y-@@ chas@@ ing gir@@ l@@ y-@@ girl to finally just a h@@ es@@ it@@ ant expl@@ or@@ ation of what I actually was , a tom@@ bo@@ y@@ ish girl who li@@ ked both bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls de@@ pen@@ ding on the person ."
"I had sp@@ ent a year photogra@@ ph@@ ing this new gener@@ ation of gir@@ ls , much like myself , who f@@ ell kind of bet@@ we@@ en@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ lin@@ es — gir@@ ls who sk@@ at@@ e@@ bo@@ ar@@ ded but did it in l@@ ac@@ y under@@ we@@ ar , gir@@ ls who had bo@@ ys &apos; ha@@ ir@@ c@@ ut@@ s but wor@@ e gir@@ ly na@@ il poli@@ sh , gir@@ ls who had e@@ ye@@ sha@@ do@@ w to mat@@ ch their sc@@ ra@@ ped k@@ ne@@ es , gir@@ ls who li@@ ked gir@@ ls and bo@@ ys who all li@@ ked bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls who all h@@ ated being bo@@ x@@ ed in to anything ."
"I lov@@ ed these people , and I ad@@ mi@@ red their fre@@ e@@ dom , but I wat@@ ched as the world outside of our u@@ to@@ pi@@ an bu@@ b@@ ble ex@@ plod@@ ed into these ra@@ ging de@@ b@@ ates where p@@ un@@ d@@ its started lik@@ ening our love to b@@ esti@@ ality on national tele@@ vision ."
"And this powerful a@@ war@@ en@@ ess ro@@ l@@ led in over me that I was a min@@ or@@ ity , and in my own home country , based on one fac@@ et of my charac@@ ter ."
I was leg@@ ally and in@@ dis@@ pu@@ ta@@ bly a secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s c@@ it@@ iz@@ en .
I was not an activ@@ ist .
I w@@ ave no fl@@ ag@@ s in my own life .
But I was pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed by this question : How could any@@ one v@@ ot@@ e to stri@@ p the ri@@ ghts of the v@@ ast vari@@ ety of people that I knew based on one ele@@ ment of their charac@@ ter ?
How could they say that we as a group were not des@@ er@@ ving of equ@@ al ri@@ ghts as somebody else ?
W@@ ere we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even consci@@ ously met a vi@@ cti@@ m of their dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation ?
D@@ id they know who they were v@@ ot@@ ing against and what the imp@@ act was ?
"And then it oc@@ cur@@ red to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were c@@ ast@@ ing into secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s c@@ it@@ iz@@ en@@ ship it might make it har@@ der for them to do ."
It might give them p@@ ause .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same din@@ ner par@@ ty , so I fi@@ gu@@ red out a way where I could in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce them to each other photogra@@ ph@@ ically without any arti@@ f@@ ice , without any li@@ gh@@ ting , or without any m@@ ani@@ pul@@ ation of any kind on my part ."
Because in a photogra@@ ph you can exam@@ ine a lion &apos;s wh@@ isk@@ ers without the fe@@ ar of him ri@@ pp@@ ing your face off .
"For me , photogra@@ ph@@ y is not just about ex@@ pos@@ ing fil@@ m , it &apos;s about ex@@ pos@@ ing the vi@@ e@@ wer to something new , a place they hav@@ en &apos;t gone before , but most import@@ an@@ tly , to people that they might be af@@ ra@@ id of ."
"L@@ i@@ fe magaz@@ ine in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed gener@@ ations of people to dist@@ ant , far@@ -@@ off cul@@ tures they never knew exist@@ ed through pic@@ tures ."
"So I decided to make a seri@@ es of very simple por@@ tra@@ its , mu@@ g@@ sh@@ ots if you will ."
"And I basically decided to photogra@@ ph any@@ one in this country that was not 100 percent stra@@ ight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a lim@@ it@@ less number of people ."
"( Laughter ) So this was a very large under@@ taking , and to do it we needed some help ."
"So I ran out in the fre@@ ez@@ ing c@@ old , and I photogra@@ ph@@ ed every single person that I knew that I could get to in F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary of about two years ago ."
"And I took those photogra@@ ph@@ s , and I went to the H@@ R@@ C and I asked them for some help ."
And they fun@@ ded two we@@ eks of sho@@ ot@@ ing in New York .
And then we made this .
"( Mu@@ sic ) V@@ ideo : I &apos;m i@@ O T@@ ill@@ et@@ t W@@ right , and I &apos;m an art@@ ist born and ra@@ is@@ ed in New York C@@ ity . ( Mu@@ sic )"
S@@ el@@ f E@@ vid@@ ent T@@ ru@@ ths is a photogra@@ ph@@ ic recor@@ d of L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q America today .

"A@@ l@@ most 8@@ 5@@ ,000 people wat@@ ched that video , and then they started em@@ ail@@ ing us from all over the country , as@@ king us to come to their to@@ w@@ ns and help them to show their fac@@ es ."
And a lot more people wanted to show their fac@@ es than I had anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated .

"That video was made in the sp@@ r@@ ing of 20@@ 11 , and as of today I have trav@@ el@@ ed to almost 20 cities and photogra@@ ph@@ ed almost 2@@ ,000 people ."
"I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minut@@ e of just qui@@ et and have you just look at these fac@@ es because there is nothing that I can say that will ad@@ d to them ."
"Because if a picture is wor@@ th a thou@@ s@@ and words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary ."
"So after trav@@ el@@ ing and talking to people in places like O@@ kla@@ hom@@ a or sm@@ all@@ -@@ to@@ wn T@@ ex@@ as , we found evid@@ ence that the in@@ iti@@ al pre@@ mi@@ se was de@@ ad on ."
V@@ i@@ sibil@@ ity really is key .

"O@@ f course , there were lots of people who op@@ ted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much lar@@ ger pro@@ por@@ tion of people id@@ enti@@ fi@@ ed as something that was much more nu@@ an@@ ced ."
I found that most people f@@ all on a spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of what I have come to re@@ f@@ er to as &quot; &quot; Gre@@ y . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that pre@@ fer@@ ence doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
"And I am not even going to add@@ ress the issue of cho@@ ice ver@@ su@@ s biolog@@ ical im@@ per@@ ative , because if any of you happen to be of the beli@@ e@@ f that se@@ x@@ ual ori@@ ent@@ ation is a cho@@ ice , I inv@@ ite you to go out and try to be gre@@ y ."
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human be@@ ings are not on@@ e-@@ d@@ imen@@ si@@ onal .
"The most important thing to take from the perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge system is this : If you have g@@ ay people over here and you have stra@@ ight people over here , and while we recogniz@@ e that most people id@@ enti@@ fy as some@@ where clo@@ s@@ er to one bin@@ ary or another , there is this v@@ ast spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of people that ex@@ ist in between ."
And the reality that this pres@@ ents is a comp@@ lic@@ ated one .
"Because , for example , if you pas@@ s a la@@ w that allo@@ ws a b@@ os@@ s to fi@@ re an em@@ plo@@ y@@ ee for ho@@ mo@@ se@@ x@@ ual behavi@@ or , where exactly do you dra@@ w the line ?"
"I@@ s it over here , by the people who have had one or two h@@ et@@ er@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ ual experi@@ ences so far ?"
O@@ r is it over here by the people who have only had one or two ho@@ mo@@ se@@ x@@ ual experi@@ ences th@@ us far ?
Wh@@ ere exactly does one become a secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s c@@ it@@ iz@@ en ?
A@@ no@@ ther interesting thing that I learned from my project and my trav@@ els is just what a po@@ or bin@@ ding ag@@ ent se@@ x@@ ual ori@@ ent@@ ation is .
"A@@ f@@ ter trav@@ el@@ ing so much and me@@ et@@ ing so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many j@@ er@@ ks and s@@ we@@ e@@ the@@ ar@@ ts and De@@ mo@@ c@@ rat@@ s and Re@@ publi@@ c@@ ans and j@@ oc@@ ks and qu@@ e@@ ens and every other pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation you can pos@@ si@@ bly think of within the L@@ G@@ B@@ T community as there are within the human ra@@ ce ."
"A@@ side from the fact that we play with one leg@@ al hand ti@@ ed behind our bac@@ ks , and once you get past the sha@@ red nar@@ r@@ ative of pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce and stru@@ gg@@ le , just being other than stra@@ ight doesn &apos;t ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily mean that we have anything in common ."
"So in the en@@ dl@@ ess pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of fac@@ es that S@@ el@@ f E@@ vid@@ ent T@@ ru@@ ths is always be@@ coming , as it ho@@ pe@@ fully appe@@ ar@@ s across more and more plat@@ form@@ s , bu@@ s sh@@ el@@ ters , bil@@ l@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , F@@ ace@@ book p@@ ages , scre@@ en sav@@ ers , perhaps in wat@@ ching this proc@@ es@@ sion of hum@@ an@@ ity , something interesting and u@@ se@@ ful will beg@@ in to happen ."
"H@@ o@@ pe@@ fully these cat@@ eg@@ ories , these bin@@ ari@@ es , these over@@ -@@ sim@@ pli@@ fi@@ ed bo@@ x@@ es will beg@@ in to become us@@ el@@ ess and they &apos;ll beg@@ in to f@@ all away ."
"Because really , they descri@@ be nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are ."
What we see are human be@@ ings in all their mul@@ ti@@ p@@ lic@@ ity .
And seeing them makes it har@@ der to d@@ eny their hum@@ an@@ ity .
A@@ t the very least I hope it makes it har@@ der to d@@ eny their human ri@@ ghts .
"So is it me particul@@ arly that you would cho@@ ose to d@@ eny the right to hou@@ sing , the right to a@@ do@@ pt children , the right to mar@@ ri@@ age , the fre@@ e@@ dom to sho@@ p here , live here , bu@@ y here ?"
"A@@ m I the one that you cho@@ ose to dis@@ own as your child or your bro@@ ther or your sist@@ er or your mother or your father , your ne@@ igh@@ bor , your cou@@ s@@ in , your un@@ cle , the pre@@ sid@@ ent , your poli@@ ce woman or the fi@@ rem@@ an ?"
It &apos;s too l@@ ate .
Because I already am all of those things .
"We already are all of those things , and we always have been ."
"So ple@@ ase don &apos;t gre@@ et us as stran@@ g@@ ers , gre@@ et us as your fel@@ low human be@@ ings , period ."

"In India and N@@ ep@@ al , I was in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed to the bri@@ ck kil@@ ns ."
This stran@@ ge and aw@@ es@@ ome si@@ ght was like wal@@ king into an@@ ci@@ ent E@@ g@@ y@@ pt or D@@ an@@ te &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
"E@@ n@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in temper@@ at@@ ures of 1@@ 30 de@@ gre@@ es , men , women , children , entire famili@@ es in fact , were clo@@ ak@@ ed in a he@@ av@@ y bl@@ an@@ k@@ et of du@@ st , while me@@ chan@@ ically st@@ ac@@ king bri@@ cks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and car@@ ry@@ ing them from the sc@@ or@@ ching kil@@ ns to tru@@ cks hun@@ dre@@ ds of y@@ ar@@ ds away ."
"D@@ e@@ ad@@ en@@ ed by mon@@ ot@@ ony and ex@@ h@@ au@@ sti@@ on , they work sil@@ ently , doing this ta@@ s@@ k over and over for 1@@ 6 or 1@@ 7 hours a day ."
"There were no bre@@ ak@@ s for food , no water bre@@ ak@@ s , and the se@@ v@@ ere de@@ hy@@ d@@ r@@ ation made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ con@@ sequ@@ ential ."
So per@@ va@@ sive was the he@@ at and the du@@ st that my cam@@ era became too ho@@ t to even tou@@ ch and c@@ eas@@ ed working .
"E@@ very 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our c@@ ru@@ is@@ er to cle@@ an out my ge@@ ar and run it under an air cond@@ iti@@ on@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it , and as I s@@ at there , I thought , my cam@@ era is getting far better tre@@ at@@ ment than these people ."
"B@@ ack in the kil@@ ns , I wanted to c@@ ry , but the ab@@ ol@@ iti@@ on@@ ist next to me quickly gra@@ b@@ bed me and he said , &quot; &quot; L@@ is@@ a , don &apos;t do that .

I couldn &apos;t off@@ er them any direc@@ t help .
"I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing ."
I wasn &apos;t a c@@ it@@ iz@@ en of that country .
I could get them in a wor@@ se situ@@ ation than they were already in .
"I &apos;d have to rely on F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ av@@ es to work within the system for their li@@ ber@@ ation , and I tru@@ st@@ ed that they would ."
"As for me , I &apos;d have to wa@@ it until I got home to really feel my hear@@ t@@ bre@@ ak ."
"In the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as , I found children car@@ ry@@ ing st@@ one for mil@@ es down m@@ oun@@ tain@@ ous ter@@ ra@@ in to tru@@ cks wa@@ iting at ro@@ ads bel@@ ow ."
"The big she@@ ets of sl@@ ate were he@@ av@@ i@@ er than the children car@@ ry@@ ing them , and the kids ho@@ ist@@ ed them from their he@@ ads using these han@@ d@@ made har@@ nes@@ ses of st@@ ic@@ ks and ro@@ pe and tor@@ n cl@@ ot@@ h ."
It &apos;s difficult to w@@ it@@ ness something so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
"H@@ ow can we aff@@ ect something so in@@ si@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ va@@ sive ?"
"S@@ ome don &apos;t even know they &apos;re en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed , people working 1@@ 6 , 1@@ 7 hours a day without any p@@ ay , because this has been the case all their lives ."
They have nothing to comp@@ are it to .
"When these v@@ ill@@ ag@@ ers c@@ la@@ im@@ ed their fre@@ e@@ dom , the sl@@ av@@ eh@@ ol@@ ders bur@@ ned down all of their hou@@ ses ."
"I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so p@@ et@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the cent@@ er r@@ al@@ li@@ ed for them to per@@ se@@ v@@ ere , and ab@@ ol@@ iti@@ on@@ ist@@ s on the ground hel@@ ped them get a qu@@ ar@@ ry le@@ ase of their own , so that now they do the same back@@ -@@ bre@@ a@@ king work , but they do it for themselves , and they get pa@@ id for it , and they do it in fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"Se@@ x tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word sl@@ av@@ ery , and because of this wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work sa@@ f@@ ely within this particular indu@@ stry ."
"In Ka@@ th@@ man@@ du , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had pre@@ vi@@ ously been se@@ x sl@@ av@@ es themselves ."
"They ush@@ er@@ ed me down a nar@@ row set of sta@@ ir@@ s that led to this di@@ r@@ ty , d@@ im@@ ly f@@ lu@@ o@@ res@@ c@@ ent li@@ t ba@@ se@@ ment ."
"This wasn &apos;t a bro@@ the@@ l , per se ."
It was more like a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant .
"C@@ ab@@ in re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts , as they &apos;re known in the tra@@ de , are ven@@ ues for for@@ ced prost@@ it@@ ution ."
"E@@ ach has small , priv@@ ate ro@@ om@@ s , where the sl@@ av@@ es , women , along with young gir@@ ls and bo@@ ys , some as young as se@@ ven years old , are for@@ ced to en@@ ter@@ tain the c@@ li@@ ents , en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging them to bu@@ y more food and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ."
"E@@ ach cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le is dar@@ k and din@@ gy , id@@ enti@@ fi@@ ed with a pain@@ ted number on the w@@ all , and part@@ iti@@ on@@ ed by pl@@ y@@ wo@@ od and a cur@@ tain ."
The work@@ ers here often en@@ d@@ ure tra@@ gic se@@ x@@ ual ab@@ use at the hands of their cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers .
"S@@ tan@@ ding in the ne@@ ar dar@@ k@@ ness , I remember feel@@ ing this qu@@ ick , ho@@ t fe@@ ar , and in that inst@@ ant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be tra@@ pped in that h@@ ell ."
I had only one way out : the sta@@ ir@@ s from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back do@@ ors .
There were no win@@ do@@ ws large enough to clim@@ b through .
"Th@@ ese people have no es@@ cap@@ e at all , and as we take in such a difficult sub@@ ject , it &apos;s important to not@@ e that sl@@ av@@ ery , inclu@@ ding se@@ x tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king , oc@@ cur@@ s in our own back@@ y@@ ard as well ."
"T@@ ens of hun@@ dre@@ ds of people are en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed in ag@@ ri@@ culture , in re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts , in dom@@ est@@ ic ser@@ v@@ it@@ u@@ de , and the li@@ st can go on ."
"R@@ ec@@ ently , the New York T@@ imes re@@ por@@ ted that between 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 and 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 American children are sol@@ d into se@@ x sl@@ av@@ ery every year ."
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The te@@ x@@ t@@ ile indu@@ stry is another one we often think of when we hear about sl@@ ave lab@@ or .
I vis@@ ited v@@ ill@@ ages in India where entire famili@@ es were en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed in the sil@@ k tra@@ de .
This is a family por@@ tra@@ it .
"The dy@@ ed black hands are the father , while the bl@@ ue and red hands are his s@@ ons ."
"They mi@@ x d@@ ye in these big bar@@ rel@@ s , and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the sil@@ k into the li@@ qu@@ id up to their el@@ bo@@ ws , but the d@@ ye is to@@ x@@ ic ."
My inter@@ pre@@ ter told me their stories .
"&quot; &quot; We have no fre@@ e@@ dom , &quot; &quot; they said ."
"&quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get pa@@ id for our d@@ ye@@ ing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s est@@ im@@ ated that more than 4@@ ,000 children are en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed on L@@ a@@ ke V@@ ol@@ ta , the lar@@ g@@ est man@@ -@@ made la@@ ke in the world ."
"When we first ar@@ ri@@ ved , I went to have a qu@@ ick look ."
"I saw what se@@ em@@ ed to be a family fi@@ sh@@ ing on a bo@@ at , two ol@@ der bro@@ thers , some youn@@ ger kids , makes sense right ?"
W@@ ron@@ g . They were all en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed .
"Ch@@ il@@ dren are taken from their famili@@ es and tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ ked and v@@ ani@@ shed , and they &apos;re for@@ ced to work en@@ dl@@ ess hours on these bo@@ ats on the la@@ ke , even though they do not know how to sw@@ im ."
This young child is e@@ ight years old .
"He was t@@ rem@@ bl@@ ing when our bo@@ at appro@@ ach@@ ed , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed it would run over his tiny can@@ oe ."
He was p@@ et@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed he would be kno@@ c@@ ked in the water .

"@@ in the c@@ old , win@@ dy night ."
And it &apos;s important to not@@ e that these n@@ ets we@@ igh more than a thou@@ s@@ and po@@ un@@ ds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was res@@ cu@@ ed from a fi@@ sh@@ ing v@@ ill@@ age .
I met him at a sh@@ el@@ ter where F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ av@@ es re@@ h@@ abil@@ it@@ ates vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s of sl@@ av@@ ery .
"H@@ ere he &apos;s seen taking a b@@ ath at the well , po@@ uring big bu@@ ck@@ ets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sit@@ ting here talking today , K@@ of@@ i has been re@@ un@@ ited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given to@@ ols to make a living and to keep their children sa@@ fe ."
K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bod@@ im@@ ent of pos@@ sibil@@ ity .
Wh@@ o will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
"D@@ ri@@ ving down a ro@@ ad in G@@ h@@ ana with part@@ n@@ ers of F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ av@@ es , a fel@@ low ab@@ ol@@ iti@@ on@@ ist on a mo@@ ped sud@@ den@@ ly sp@@ ed up to our c@@ ru@@ is@@ er and ta@@ pped on the win@@ do@@ w ."
He told us to fol@@ low him down a di@@ r@@ t ro@@ ad into the ju@@ n@@ g@@ le .

"M@@ any women had children stra@@ pped to their bac@@ ks while they were pan@@ ning for g@@ old , w@@ ad@@ ing in water pois@@ on@@ ed by mer@@ cur@@ y ."

"We started experim@@ ent@@ ing , as you can see , in terms of sh@@ ap@@ es , form@@ s . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our p@@ et project . It &apos;s succ@@ ess@@ ful , it &apos;s been ru@@ n@@ ning for 12 years . And we sup@@ ply the Con@@ ran sh@@ op@@ s , and D@@ on@@ na Ka@@ ran , and so it &apos;s kind of great ."
"This is our group , our ma@@ in group of we@@ av@@ ers ."
They come on a we@@ ek@@ ly bas@@ is to D@@ ur@@ b@@ an .
They all have b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts .
They &apos;ve all mo@@ ved back to the ru@@ ral area where they came from .
It &apos;s a we@@ ek@@ ly tur@@ na@@ round of produc@@ tion .
This is the community that I orig@@ in@@ ally sho@@ wed you the sli@@ de of .

"In an age of global stri@@ fe and clim@@ ate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is se@@ x so dam@@ n good ?"
"If you &apos;re l@@ augh@@ ing , you know what I mean ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s why . B@@ ack in univers@@ ity , we had a qu@@ ick project to design some sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed clo@@ cks ."
Here &apos;s my clo@@ ck .
"It us@@ es something called the d@@ war@@ f su@@ n@@ flo@@ wer , which gro@@ ws to about 12 in@@ ch@@ es in he@@ ight ."
"Now , as you know , su@@ n@@ flo@@ wers tra@@ ck the su@@ n during the course of the day ."
"So in the mor@@ ning , you see which direc@@ tion the su@@ n@@ flo@@ wer is fac@@ ing , and you mar@@ k it on the bl@@ ank area in the b@@ ase ."
"A@@ t no@@ on , you mar@@ k the changed pos@@ ition of the su@@ n@@ flo@@ wer , and in the ev@@ ening again , and that &apos;s your clo@@ ck ."
"Now , I know my clo@@ ck doesn &apos;t tell you the ex@@ act time , but it does give you a gener@@ al idea using a flo@@ wer ."
"So , in my completely un@@ bi@@ as@@ ed , sub@@ jec@@ tive op@@ in@@ ion , it &apos;s br@@ illi@@ ant ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , here &apos;s Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck ."
It &apos;s five mag@@ ni@@ f@@ ying glas@@ ses with a sh@@ ot glas@@ s under each one .
In each sh@@ ot glas@@ s is a different sc@@ ented oil .
"In the mor@@ ning , the su@@ n@@ light will sh@@ ine down on the first mag@@ ni@@ f@@ ying glas@@ s , foc@@ using a be@@ am of light on the sh@@ ot glas@@ s under@@ ne@@ ath ."
"This will war@@ m up the sc@@ ented oil inside , and a particular sm@@ ell will be em@@ it@@ ted ."
"So during the course of the day , five different sm@@ ell@@ s are dis@@ per@@ sed throu@@ gh@@ out that environment ."
A@@ ny@@ one living in that house can tell the time just by the sm@@ ell .
You can see why I h@@ ate Ch@@ ris .
One thing you have to know about me is I h@@ ate to lo@@ se .
This problem &apos;s been bu@@ gg@@ ing me for well over a de@@ ca@@ de .
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why se@@ x is so good ."
"M@@ any years after the sol@@ ar power@@ ed clo@@ cks project , a young la@@ dy I knew su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed maybe se@@ x is so good because of the five sen@@ ses ."
"And when she said this , I had an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any ."
So I decided to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate different experi@@ ences I had in my life from the point of view of the five sen@@ ses .
"To do this , I de@@ vis@@ ed something called the five sen@@ ses gra@@ ph ."
"A@@ long the y-@@ a@@ x@@ is , you have a scale from zer@@ o to 10 , and along the x@@ -@@ a@@ x@@ is , you have , of course , the five sen@@ ses ."
"A@@ ny@@ time I had a mem@@ or@@ able experience in my life , I would recor@@ d it on this gra@@ ph like a five sen@@ ses di@@ ary ."
Here &apos;s a qu@@ ick video to show you how it works .
"B@@ ike desig@@ ner : This is &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , cu@@ sto@@ m bi@@ ke desig@@ ner ."
( M@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ le re@@ v@@ ving ) &#91; S@@ ound &#93; &#91; T@@ ou@@ ch &#93; &#91; S@@ ight &#93; &#91; S@@ m@@ ell &#93; &#91; T@@ ast@@ e &#93; J@@ L : And that &apos;s how the five sen@@ ses gra@@ ph works .
So here are some other resul@@ ts .
The first is for inst@@ ant no@@ od@@ les .
"Now obvi@@ ously , ta@@ st@@ e and sm@@ ell are quite high , but not@@ ice sound is at three ."
"You know . ( S@@ l@@ ur@@ ps ) Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , I no longer d@@ ine with these people ."
"O@@ K , next , clu@@ b@@ b@@ ing ."
These people I still do han@@ g out with .
"A@@ ll right , and s@@ mo@@ king ."
"H@@ ere I found tou@@ ch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reas@@ ons is that s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers told me the sen@@ s@@ ation of hol@@ ding a ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ te and br@@ ing@@ ing it up to your li@@ ps is a big part of the s@@ mo@@ king experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of sc@@ ary to think how well ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ t@@ es are desig@@ ned by the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers ."
"O@@ K . Now , what would the perf@@ ect experience look like on the five sen@@ ses gra@@ ph ?"
"It would , of course , be a hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal line along the top ."
"Now you can see , not even as in@@ ten@@ se an experience as ri@@ ding a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke comes close ."
"In fact , in the years that I ga@@ ther@@ ed data , only one experience came close to being the perf@@ ect one ."
"That is , of course , se@@ x . Gre@@ at se@@ x ."
R@@ es@@ pon@@ d@@ ents said that great se@@ x h@@ its all of the five sen@@ ses at an ex@@ tre@@ me level .
So the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory does help expla@@ in why se@@ x is so good .
"Now in the middle of all this five sen@@ ses work , I sud@@ den@@ ly rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed the sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed clo@@ cks project from my y@@ outh ."
And I realized this the@@ ory also expla@@ ins why Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck is so much better than m@@ ine .
"You see , my clo@@ ck only foc@@ us@@ es on si@@ ght , and a little bit of tou@@ ch ."
Here &apos;s Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck .
It &apos;s the first clo@@ ck ever that us@@ es sm@@ ell to tell the time .
"In fact , in terms of the five sen@@ ses , Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck is a revol@@ ution ."
And that &apos;s what this the@@ ory ta@@ u@@ ght me about my fiel@@ d .
"You see , up t@@ ill now , us desig@@ n@@ ers , we &apos;ve ma@@ in@@ ly foc@@ used on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of tou@@ ch , which means we &apos;ve ig@@ no@@ red the other three sen@@ ses ."
Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck shows us that even ra@@ is@@ ing just one of those other sen@@ ses can make for a br@@ illi@@ ant produc@@ t .
So what if we started using the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory in all of our desig@@ ns ?
Here &apos;s three qu@@ ick ideas I came up with .
"We could call this &quot; &quot; the perf@@ um@@ ator . &quot; &quot; All right , next ."
"So I b@@ ru@@ sh my te@@ et@@ h tw@@ ice a day , and what if we had a to@@ o@@ th@@ b@@ ru@@ sh that ta@@ st@@ es like can@@ dy , and when the ta@@ st@@ e of can@@ dy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your to@@ o@@ th@@ b@@ ru@@ sh ?"
"F@@ in@@ ally , I have a thing for the ke@@ ys on a fl@@ ute or a c@@ lar@@ in@@ et ."
"It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you pres@@ s down on them ."
"Now , I don &apos;t play the fl@@ ute or the c@@ lar@@ in@@ et , so I decided to com@@ b@@ ine these ke@@ ys with an instru@@ ment I do play : the tele@@ vision rem@@ ot@@ e control ."
"Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll not@@ ice that the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these produc@@ ts but also the way they look ."
"Now , I realiz@@ e the five sen@@ ses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting ."
There &apos;s also the six emot@@ i@@ ons and that el@@ u@@ sive x@@ -@@ fac@@ tor .
Ma@@ ybe that could be the to@@ pi@@ c of my next talk .
"U@@ n@@ til then , ple@@ ase have fu@@ n using the five sen@@ ses in your own lives and your own desig@@ ns ."
"O@@ h , one last thing before I leave ."
And the best way to do that is with free can@@ dy .
You guys ready ?
All right .
( Applause )
"When I was six years old , I rec@@ ei@@ ved my gi@@ f@@ ts ."
My first gra@@ de teach@@ er had this br@@ illi@@ ant idea .
She wanted us to experience rec@@ ei@@ ving gi@@ f@@ ts but also learning the vir@@ tu@@ e of comp@@ li@@ men@@ ting each other .
"So she had all of us come to the front of the clas@@ s@@ room , and she b@@ ou@@ ght all of us gi@@ f@@ ts and st@@ ac@@ ked them in the cor@@ ner ."
"And she said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we just stand here and comp@@ li@@ ment each other ?"
"If you hear your name called , go and pic@@ k up your gi@@ ft and sit down . &quot; &quot; What a wonderful idea , right ?"
What could go wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Well , there were 40 of us to start with , and every time I heard someone &apos;s name called , I would give out the hear@@ ti@@ est che@@ er ."
"And then there were 20 people left , and 10 people left , and five left ..@@ ."
and three left .
And I was one of them .
And the comp@@ li@@ ments sto@@ pped .
"Well , at that moment , I was c@@ ry@@ ing ."
And the teach@@ er was fre@@ a@@ king out .
"S@@ he was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , would any@@ one say anything ni@@ ce about these people ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; No one ? OK , why don &apos;t you go get your gi@@ ft and sit down ."
But I don &apos;t know who felt wor@@ se that day .
W@@ as it me or the teach@@ er ?
She must have realized that she turned a te@@ am@@ -@@ building ev@@ ent into a public ro@@ ast for three si@@ x@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds .
And without the hu@@ mo@@ r .
"You know , when you see people get ro@@ ast@@ ed on T@@ V , it was fun@@ ny ."
There was nothing fun@@ ny about that day .
"So that was one ver@@ sion of me , and I would die to av@@ o@@ id being in that situ@@ ation again — to get re@@ jec@@ ted in public again ."
That &apos;s one ver@@ sion .
Th@@ en f@@ ast@@ -@@ for@@ ward e@@ ight years .
"B@@ ill G@@ ates came to my hom@@ eto@@ wn — B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , China — to speak , and I saw his mes@@ sage ."
I f@@ ell in love with that guy .
"I thought , w@@ ow , I know what I want to do now ."
"That night I w@@ ro@@ te a let@@ ter to my family telling them : &quot; &quot; B@@ y age 25 , I will build the bi@@ gg@@ est company in the world , and that company will bu@@ y M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I tot@@ ally em@@ bra@@ ced this idea of con@@ qu@@ ering the world — dom@@ in@@ ation , right ?"
"And I didn &apos;t make this up , I did write that let@@ ter ."
"And here it is — ( Laughter ) You don &apos;t have to read this through — ( Laughter ) This is also bad han@@ d@@ writ@@ ing , but I did high@@ light some key words ."
You get the idea .
( Laughter ) So ...
that was another ver@@ sion of me : one who will con@@ qu@@ er the world .
"Well , then two years later , I was pres@@ ented with the opport@@ unity to come to the United States ."
"I ju@@ mp@@ ed on it , because that was where B@@ ill G@@ ates li@@ ved , right ?"
( Laughter ) I thought that was the start of my ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur jour@@ ney .
"Th@@ en , f@@ ast@@ -@@ for@@ ward another 1@@ 4 years ."
I was 30 .
"N@@ op@@ e , I didn &apos;t build that company ."
I didn &apos;t even start .
I was actually a mark@@ et@@ ing manag@@ er for a F@@ or@@ tu@@ ne 500 company .
And I felt I was stu@@ ck ; I was st@@ ag@@ n@@ ant .
Why is that ?
Wh@@ ere is that 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old who w@@ ro@@ te that let@@ ter ?
It &apos;s not because he didn &apos;t try .
One wanted to con@@ qu@@ er the world — make a difference — another was af@@ ra@@ id of re@@ jec@@ tion .
And every time that si@@ x@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old won .
And this fe@@ ar even per@@ sist@@ ed after I started my own company .
"I mean , I started my own company when I was 30 — if you want to be B@@ ill G@@ ates , you &apos;ve got to start so@@ on@@ er or later , right ?"
"When I was an ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur , I was pres@@ ented with an invest@@ ment opport@@ unity , and then I was turned down ."
And that re@@ jec@@ tion h@@ ur@@ t me .
It h@@ ur@@ t me so bad that I wanted to qu@@ it right there .
"But then I thought , h@@ ey , would B@@ ill G@@ ates qu@@ it after a simple invest@@ ment re@@ jec@@ tion ?"
W@@ ould any succ@@ ess@@ ful ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur qu@@ it like that ?
No way .
And this is where it c@@ lic@@ ked for me .
"O@@ K , I can build a better company ."
"I can build a better team or better produc@@ t , but one thing for sure : I &apos;ve got to be a better le@@ ad@@ er ."
I &apos;ve got to be a better person .
I can@@ not let that si@@ x@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old keep di@@ c@@ tat@@ ing my life any@@ more .
I have to put him back in his place .
So this is where I went on@@ line and looked for help .
Google was my friend .
"( Laughter ) I sear@@ ched , &quot; &quot; How do I over@@ come the fe@@ ar of re@@ jec@@ tion ? &quot; &quot; I came up with a bu@@ n@@ ch of p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ y arti@@ cl@@ es about where the fe@@ ar and pa@@ in are coming from ."
"Th@@ en I came up with a bu@@ n@@ ch of &quot; &quot; ra@@ h@@ -@@ ra@@ h &quot; &quot; in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ational arti@@ cl@@ es about &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t take it person@@ ally , just over@@ come it . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o doesn &apos;t know that ?"
( Laughter ) But why was I still so sc@@ a@@ red ?
Th@@ en I found this we@@ b@@ s@@ ite by lu@@ ck .
H@@ is name is J@@ as@@ on C@@ om@@ ely .
"And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for re@@ jec@@ tion , and every day get re@@ jec@@ ted at something , and then by the end , you des@@ en@@ sit@@ ize y@@ ourself from the pa@@ in ."
And I lov@@ ed that idea .
"( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? I &apos;m going to do this ."
And so here &apos;s what I did .
This is what the blo@@ g looked like .
D@@ ay One ...
( Laughter ) B@@ or@@ row 100 dollars from a stran@@ ger .
So this is where I went to where I was working .
I came do@@ w@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s and I saw this big guy sit@@ ting behind a des@@ k .
He looked like a se@@ cur@@ ity gu@@ ard .
So I just appro@@ ach@@ ed him .
"And I was just wal@@ king and that was the lon@@ g@@ est walk of my life — ha@@ ir on the back of my ne@@ ck standing up , I was s@@ we@@ ating and my heart was po@@ un@@ ding ."
"( Laughter ) And he looked up , he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot;"
"And I just said , &quot; &quot; No ? I &apos;m sor@@ ry . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I turned around , and I just ran ."
( Laughter ) I felt so em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sed .
"But because I fil@@ med myself — so that night I was wat@@ ching myself getting re@@ jec@@ ted , I just saw how sc@@ a@@ red I was ."
I looked like this ki@@ d in &quot; &quot; The S@@ i@@ x@@ th S@@ en@@ se . &quot; &quot; I saw de@@ ad people .
( Laughter ) But then I saw this guy .
"You know , he wasn &apos;t that men@@ ac@@ ing ."
"He was a chu@@ b@@ by , lov@@ e@@ able guy , and he even asked me , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; In fact , he inv@@ ited me to expla@@ in myself ."
And I could &apos;ve said many things .
"I could &apos;ve expla@@ ined , I could &apos;ve ne@@ got@@ i@@ ated ."
I didn &apos;t do any of that .
All I did was run .
"I felt , w@@ ow , this is like a micro@@ c@@ os@@ m of my life ."
"E@@ very time I felt the sli@@ gh@@ test re@@ jec@@ tion , I would just run as f@@ ast as I could ."
And you know what ?
"The next day , no matter what happens , I &apos;m not going to run ."
I &apos;ll st@@ ay eng@@ ag@@ ed .
"D@@ ay T@@ w@@ o : R@@ equ@@ est a &quot; &quot; bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s when I went to a bur@@ ger jo@@ in@@ t , I fin@@ ish@@ ed l@@ un@@ ch , and I went to the ca@@ shi@@ er and said , &quot; H@@ i , can I get a bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill ? &quot; ( Laughter )"
"He was all conf@@ used , like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s just like a d@@ rin@@ k re@@ f@@ ill but with a bur@@ ger . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ or@@ ry , we don &apos;t do bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill , man . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So this is where re@@ jec@@ tion happened and I could have run , but I sta@@ yed ."
"And by the way , I don &apos;t think they &apos;ve ever done bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill ."
( Laughter ) I think they &apos;re still there .
"But the life and de@@ ath feel@@ ing I was feel@@ ing the first time was no longer there , just because I sta@@ yed eng@@ ag@@ ed — because I didn &apos;t run ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , great , I &apos;m already learning things ."
This is where my life was turned up@@ side down .
I went to a K@@ ri@@ sp@@ y K@@ re@@ me .
"I &apos;m sure they have some here , too ."
"And I went in , I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you make me d@@ ou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts that look like O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c sym@@ bol@@ s ?"
"B@@ a@@ sically , you inter@@ lin@@ k five d@@ ou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts together ... &quot; &quot; I mean there &apos;s no way they could say yes , right ?"
The d@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut mak@@ er took me so seri@@ ously .
"( Laughter ) So she put out pa@@ per , started j@@ ot@@ ting down the col@@ ors and the r@@ ings , and is like , &quot; &quot; How can I make this ? &quot; &quot; And then 15 minutes later , she came out with a bo@@ x that looked like O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c r@@ ings ."
And I was so tou@@ ched .
I just couldn &apos;t believe it .
And that video got over five million vi@@ e@@ ws on Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be .
The world couldn &apos;t believe that ei@@ ther .
"( Laughter ) You know , because of that I was in ne@@ w@@ spa@@ per@@ s , in talk shows , in everything ."
And I became fam@@ ous .
"A lot of people started writ@@ ing em@@ ail@@ s to me and saying , &quot; &quot; What you &apos;re doing is aw@@ es@@ ome . &quot; &quot; But you know , f@@ ame and not@@ ori@@ ety did not do anything to me ."
"What I really wanted to do was learn , and to change myself ."
So I turned the re@@ st of my 100 days of re@@ jec@@ tion into this pla@@ y@@ ground — into this research project .
I wanted to see what I could learn .
I discover@@ ed so many se@@ cre@@ ts .
"( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; But before he could leave I said , &quot; H@@ ey , can I know why ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I have this do@@ g that would di@@ g up anything I put in the back@@ y@@ ard ."
I don &apos;t want to w@@ ast@@ e your flo@@ wer .
"If you want to do this , go across the stre@@ et and talk to Con@@ nie ."
She lov@@ es flo@@ wers . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
I went across and kno@@ c@@ ked on Con@@ nie &apos;s do@@ or .
And she was so happy to see me .
"( Laughter ) And then half an h@@ our later , there was this flo@@ wer in Con@@ nie &apos;s back@@ y@@ ard ."
I &apos;m sure it looks better now .
It was no@@ ne of those .
It was because what I off@@ er@@ ed did not f@@ it what he wanted .
I con@@ ver@@ ted a re@@ fer@@ ral .
"And he was like , &quot; &quot; Oh &quot; &quot; — ye@@ ah , this is how he looked , his name is E@@ ri@@ c — and he was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; This is how he was hear@@ ing me . &quot; &quot; N@@ ot sure . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I ask him , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that we@@ ird ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s really we@@ ird , man . &quot; &quot; But as so@@ on as he said that , his whole de@@ me@@ an@@ or changed ."
It &apos;s as if he &apos;s put@@ ting all the d@@ ou@@ b@@ t on the flo@@ or .
"I said &quot; &quot; h@@ i &quot; &quot; to every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er that wal@@ ked in , and gave them hol@@ i@@ day che@@ ers ."
"B@@ y the way , I don &apos;t know what your care@@ er tra@@ jec@@ tory is , don &apos;t be a gre@@ et@@ er ."
"But then I found I could do this because I men@@ tion@@ ed , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that we@@ ird ? &quot; &quot; I men@@ tion@@ ed the d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that he was having ."
"And because I men@@ tion@@ ed , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that we@@ ird ? &quot; &quot; , that means I wasn &apos;t we@@ ird ."
"That means I was actually thinking just like him , seeing this as a we@@ ird thing ."
P@@ eople were more lik@@ ely to say yes to me .
And then I learned I could ful@@ f@@ ill my life dre@@ am ...
by as@@ king .
But because I didn &apos;t run — I k@@ ept doing it — and on the third try the prof@@ ess@@ or was very im@@ pres@@ sed .
"He said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I can use this ."
Why don &apos;t you come back in two months ? I &apos;ll f@@ it you in my cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um . &quot; &quot; And two months later I was teach@@ ing a clas@@ s .
"This is me — you probably can &apos;t see , this is a bad picture ."
"You know , sometimes you get re@@ jec@@ ted by li@@ gh@@ ting , you know ?"
"And in that picture , which you can &apos;t see , I quot@@ ed Mar@@ t@@ in L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world , who change the way we live and the way we think , are the people who were met with in@@ iti@@ al and often viol@@ ent re@@ jec@@ tions ."
"P@@ eople like Mar@@ t@@ in L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r . , like Ma@@ h@@ at@@ ma G@@ an@@ d@@ h@@ i , N@@ el@@ son M@@ an@@ dela , or even J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ ri@@ st ."
These people did not let re@@ jec@@ tion def@@ ine them .
They let their own re@@ action after re@@ jec@@ tion def@@ ine themselves .
And they em@@ bra@@ ced re@@ jec@@ tion .
"And we don &apos;t have to be those people to learn about re@@ jec@@ tion , and in my case , re@@ jec@@ tion was my cur@@ se , was my bo@@ og@@ e@@ y@@ man ."
It has bo@@ ther@@ ed me my whole life because I was ru@@ n@@ ning away from it .
Th@@ en I started em@@ bra@@ cing it .
I turned that into the bi@@ gg@@ est gi@@ ft in my life .
I started teach@@ ing people how to turn re@@ jec@@ tions into opport@@ unities .
"I use my blo@@ g , I use my talk , I use the book I just publi@@ shed , and I &apos;m even building technology to help people over@@ come their fe@@ ar of re@@ jec@@ tion ."
"When you get re@@ jec@@ ted in life , when you are fac@@ ing the next ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le or next fa@@ il@@ ure , consi@@ der the pos@@ sibil@@ ities ."
"If you just em@@ bra@@ ce them , they might become your gi@@ f@@ ts as well ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
So I gu@@ ess I was the lu@@ ck@@ y one .
My mother had 1@@ 6 pre@@ g@@ nan@@ ci@@ es .
"F@@ rom 1@@ 6 pre@@ g@@ nan@@ ci@@ es , five of us are ali@@ ve ."
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
I wanted to be a doc@@ tor to help women and children .
"So I complet@@ ed my education , but I wanted to go to univers@@ ity ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a d@@ or@@ m@@ it@@ ory for gir@@ ls , so I was acc@@ ep@@ ted in medi@@ cal school , but I could not go there ."
"So as a resul@@ t , my father s@@ ent me to America ."
I came to America .
I complet@@ ed my education .
"Wh@@ ile I was complet@@ ing my education , my country was in@@ va@@ ded by R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
"And do you know that at the time I was complet@@ ing my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country ."
"There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it ."
My family was in a re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee cam@@ p .
"So as so@@ on as I complet@@ ed my education , I b@@ rou@@ ght my family to America ."
I wanted them to be sa@@ fe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an .
"D@@ ay after day , when I list@@ en@@ ed to the news , when I fol@@ lo@@ wed what was going on with my country , my heart was bre@@ a@@ king up ."
"I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me ."
I had a good job .
I was a prof@@ ess@@ or at a univers@@ ity .
I ear@@ ned good money .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
But I wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back home .
So I went to the re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee cam@@ p .
"And when I went to the re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee cam@@ p in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an , there were 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es . 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
"A@@ b@@ out 9@@ 0 percent of them were women and children . Mo@@ st of the men have been kill@@ ed or they were in war . And you know , in the re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee cam@@ p ,"
"@@ when I went da@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ day to do a sur@@ v@@ ey , I found things you never could imagine ."
I saw a wi@@ do@@ w with five to e@@ ight children sit@@ ting there and we@@ ep@@ ing and not kno@@ wing what to do .
"I saw a young woman have no way to go any@@ where , no education , no en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , no place to even live ."
"I saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are sup@@ por@@ ting the family as a 1@@ 0-@@ to@@ -@@ 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year old bo@@ y — being the head of the hou@@ se@@ h@@ old , trying to prote@@ ct their sist@@ er and their mother and their children ."
So it was a very de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing situ@@ ation .
"My heart was be@@ ating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do ."
"A@@ t that moment , we talk about momen@@ tu@@ m ."
"A@@ t that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?"
How could I help these people ?
I am one individu@@ al . What can I do for them ?
"But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life ."
It trans@@ form@@ ed me . It gave me stat@@ us .
It gave me con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence . It gave me a care@@ er .
"It hel@@ ped me to sup@@ port my family , to bring my family to another country , to be sa@@ fe ."
"And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after ."
But do you think it was easy ?
"No , because at that time , education was ban@@ ned for gir@@ ls , completely ."
"And also , by R@@ us@@ si@@ a in@@ va@@ ding A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an , people were not tru@@ st@@ ing any@@ one ."
"It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o am I ?"
S@@ om@@ e@@ body who comes from the United States .
S@@ om@@ e@@ body who got educ@@ ated here .
D@@ id they tru@@ st me ? O@@ f course not .
So I really needed to build the tru@@ st in this community .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and sur@@ ve@@ yed and looked and looked .
I asked .
"F@@ in@@ ally , I found one man ."
He was 80 years old .
He was a mul@@ la@@ h .
"I went to his t@@ ent in the cam@@ p , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a teach@@ er . &quot;"
"And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; C@@ raz@@ y woman , c@@ raz@@ y woman , how do you think I can be a teach@@ er ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a teach@@ er . &quot; &quot; F@@ in@@ ally , he acc@@ ep@@ ted my off@@ er , and once I started a clas@@ s in his com@@ po@@ u@@ nd , the word s@@ pre@@ ad all over ."
"In a matter of one year , we had 25 scho@@ ols set up , 1@@ 5@@ ,000 children going to school , and it was amazing ."
"But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were gi@@ ving teach@@ er tra@@ ining . We were tra@@ ining women &apos;s ri@@ ghts , human ri@@ ghts , demo@@ cra@@ cy , ru@@ le of la@@ w . We were gi@@ ving all kinds of tra@@ ining . And one day , I tell you ,"
"@@ one day I was in the off@@ ice in P@@ e@@ sha@@ war , P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"A@@ ll of a sud@@ den , I saw my st@@ af@@ f ru@@ n@@ ning to ro@@ om@@ s and lo@@ c@@ king the do@@ ors and telling me , &quot; &quot; R@@ u@@ n away , hi@@ de ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a le@@ ad@@ er , what do you do ?"
You &apos;re sc@@ a@@ red . You know it &apos;s dan@@ ger@@ ous .
You know your life is on the line .
"But as a le@@ ad@@ er , you have to h@@ old it together ."
You have to h@@ old it together and show str@@ eng@@ th .
"So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were po@@ uring into my off@@ ice ."
So I inv@@ ited them to the off@@ ice .
"They came , and there were n@@ ine of them — n@@ ine T@@ ali@@ b@@ an ."
And I inv@@ ited them to have a se@@ at and have te@@ a .
They said no . They are not going to d@@ rin@@ k te@@ a .
"And of course , with the t@@ one of vo@@ ice they were using , it was very sc@@ ary , but I was really sha@@ king up ."
"But also I was stron@@ g , hol@@ ding myself up ."
"And , of course , by that time , you know how I d@@ ress — I d@@ ress from head to to@@ e in a black hi@@ ja@@ b ."
"The only thing you could see , my eyes ."
"They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?"
D@@ on &apos;t you know that school is ban@@ ned for gir@@ ls ?
"What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? Wh@@ ere is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teach@@ ing gir@@ ls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody ."
"We have some students coming , and they are all learning K@@ or@@ an , H@@ ol@@ y Bo@@ ok ."
"They tal@@ ked to each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go , leave her alone , she &apos;s OK . &quot; &quot; And you know , this time , I off@@ er@@ ed them te@@ a again , and they took a si@@ p and they left ."
"B@@ y that time , my st@@ af@@ f po@@ u@@ red into my off@@ ice ."
They were sc@@ a@@ red to de@@ ath .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t k@@ ill me .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
But everybody was happy to see me .
"V@@ ery happy , and I was happy to be ali@@ ve , of course ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ f course , I was happy to be ali@@ ve ."
"W@@ ith the f@@ all of the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , we went into the country , and we op@@ en@@ ed school after school ."
We op@@ en@@ ed women &apos;s learning cent@@ er .
We contin@@ u@@ ously op@@ en@@ ed cl@@ in@@ ics .
We worked with mo@@ thers and children .
I was very happy . I was del@@ igh@@ ted with the out@@ come of my work .
"And one day , with four tra@@ in@@ ers and one bod@@ y@@ gu@@ ard , I was going up nor@@ th of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l , and all of a sud@@ den , again , I was sto@@ pped in the middle of the ro@@ ad by 1@@ 9 young men ."
"R@@ i@@ f@@ les on their sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders , they blo@@ c@@ ked the ro@@ ad ."
"I am very sh@@ ak@@ en up , and I told myself , this is it ."
"This time , we all are going to be kill@@ ed ."
There is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t in my mind .
"But still , the moment comes , and you take str@@ eng@@ th from what@@ ever you believe and what@@ ever you do ."
It &apos;s in your heart .
So I just h@@ old myself on the side of the car .
"My le@@ g was sha@@ king , and I got outside ."
"And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?"
"They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are ."
We know where you are going .
E@@ very day you go up nor@@ th here and there .
"You build their sk@@ ill@@ s . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?"
That &apos;s all we know . &quot; &quot; And you know what that means .
"It &apos;s a tra@@ p to me , of course ."
"So I walk out of there . They said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go , go . &quot; &quot; And so I wal@@ ked into the car , I sit in the car , and I told the dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; T@@ ur@@ n around and go back to the off@@ ice . &quot; &quot; A@@ t that time , we only were sup@@ por@@ ting gir@@ ls ."
"We only had money for women to tra@@ in them , to sen@@ d them to school , and nothing else ."
"B@@ y the time I came to the off@@ ice , of course my tra@@ in@@ ers were gone ."
They ran away home . N@@ ob@@ ody sta@@ yed there .
"My bod@@ y@@ gu@@ ard was the only one there , and my vo@@ ice was completely gone ."
"I was sh@@ ak@@ en up , and I s@@ at on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to sol@@ ve this problem ?"
Because we had tra@@ ining going on up nor@@ th already .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of women were there coming to get tra@@ ining .
"So I was sit@@ ting there , all of a sud@@ den , at this moment , talking about momen@@ tu@@ m , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful do@@ nor@@ s called me about a re@@ port ."
"And she asked me , &quot; &quot; S@@ ak@@ ena ? &quot; &quot; And I ans@@ wer@@ ed her ."
"No matter what I tri@@ ed to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again ."
"&quot; OK , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;"
I told her the whole story .
"A@@ t that time , she said , &quot; &quot; OK , you go next time , and you will help them ."
"You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same ro@@ ute , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back f@@ ur@@ ther , the same young men , standing up there and hol@@ ding the ri@@ f@@ le and poin@@ ting to us to stop the car ."
"I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; OK , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; On one cond@@ ition , that what@@ ever I say , you acc@@ ept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , yes , they do ."
"So I took them to the mo@@ squ@@ e , and to make a long story shor@@ t , I told them I &apos;d give them teach@@ ers ."
"T@@ oday , they are the best tra@@ in@@ ers ."
"They learn En@@ gli@@ sh , they learn how to be teach@@ ers , they learn compu@@ ters , and they are my gu@@ id@@ es ."
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That tel@@ ls you that education trans@@ form@@ s people .
"So we are contin@@ u@@ ously gi@@ ving tra@@ ining to men , and I really believe stron@@ g@@ ly ."
I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
I just want to share this with you .
"It was a beautiful country , beautiful , pe@@ ace@@ ful country ."
We were going every@@ where .
"W@@ om@@ en were getting education : la@@ w@@ y@@ er , engine@@ er , teach@@ er , and we were going from house to house ."
We never lo@@ c@@ ked our do@@ ors .
But we want the same A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an we had before .
And I want to tell you the other side .
"T@@ oday , the women of A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ st@@ an are working very , very hard ."
They are ear@@ ning de@@ gre@@ es . They are tra@@ ining to be la@@ w@@ y@@ ers .
"They are tra@@ ining to be doc@@ tors , back again ."
"They are tra@@ ining to be teach@@ ers , and they are ru@@ n@@ ning busin@@ ess@@ es ."
"So it is so wonderful to see people like that re@@ ach their compl@@ ete pot@@ ential , and all of this is going to happen ."
"I want to share this with you , because of love , because of comp@@ as@@ sion , and because of tru@@ st and h@@ on@@ est@@ y ."
"If you have these few things with you , you will ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh ."
"We have one po@@ et , Ma@@ w@@ l@@ ā@@ n@@ ā R@@ ū@@ m@@ ī ."
"He said that by having comp@@ as@@ sion and having love , you can con@@ qu@@ er the world ."
"Th@@ ank you very , very much ."
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
"This is where I live . I live in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , at the s@@ outh parts of the Na@@ i@@ rob@@ i N@@ ational Par@@ k ."
"Th@@ ose are my da@@ d &apos;s co@@ ws at the back , and behind the co@@ ws , that &apos;s the Na@@ i@@ rob@@ i N@@ ational Par@@ k ."
"Na@@ i@@ rob@@ i N@@ ational Par@@ k is not f@@ en@@ ced in the s@@ outh wi@@ del@@ y , which means w@@ il@@ d animals like z@@ e@@ bra@@ s mi@@ gr@@ ate out of the par@@ k fre@@ ely ."
"So pred@@ at@@ ors like li@@ ons fol@@ low them , and this is what they do ."
They k@@ ill our li@@ vest@@ o@@ ck .
"This is one of the co@@ ws which was kill@@ ed at night , and I just wo@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning and I found it de@@ ad , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bu@@ ll we had ."
"My community , the Ma@@ as@@ a@@ i , we believe that we came from he@@ av@@ en with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we val@@ ue them so much ."
So I gre@@ w up h@@ ating li@@ ons so much .
"The mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who prote@@ ct our community and the li@@ vest@@ o@@ ck , and they &apos;re also up@@ set about this problem ."
So they k@@ ill the li@@ ons .
It &apos;s one of the six li@@ ons which were kill@@ ed in Na@@ i@@ rob@@ i .
And I think this is why the Na@@ i@@ rob@@ i N@@ ational Par@@ k li@@ ons are few .
"So a bo@@ y , from six to n@@ ine years old , in my community is respon@@ sible for his da@@ d &apos;s co@@ ws , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me ."
So I had to find a way of sol@@ ving this problem .
"And the first idea I got was to use fi@@ re , because I thought li@@ ons were sc@@ a@@ red of fi@@ re ."
"But I came to realiz@@ e that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even hel@@ ping the li@@ ons to see through the co@@ w@@ shed ."
So I didn &apos;t give up . I contin@@ u@@ ed .
And a second idea I got was to use a sc@@ a@@ rec@@ row .
I was trying to tri@@ ck the li@@ ons &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing ne@@ ar the co@@ w@@ shed .
"But li@@ ons are very cle@@ ver . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the sc@@ a@@ rec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he ju@@ m@@ ps in and kill@@ s the animals ."
"So one night , I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ shed with a tor@@ ch , and that day , the li@@ ons didn &apos;t come ."
And I discover@@ ed that li@@ ons are af@@ ra@@ id of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
"S@@ in@@ ce I was a small bo@@ y , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took a@@ part my mom &apos;s new radi@@ o , and that day she almost kill@@ ed me , but I learned a lot about elec@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car bat@@ ter@@ y , an indi@@ cat@@ or bo@@ x . It &apos;s a small de@@ vice found in a mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle , and it hel@@ ps mot@@ or@@ ist@@ s when they want to turn right or left . It bl@@ in@@ ks ."
"And I got a sw@@ it@@ ch where I can sw@@ it@@ ch on the li@@ ghts , on and off ."
And that &apos;s a small tor@@ ch from a bro@@ k@@ en f@@ la@@ sh@@ light .
So I set up everything .
"As you can see , the sol@@ ar pan@@ el ch@@ ar@@ ges the bat@@ ter@@ y , and the bat@@ ter@@ y su@@ pp@@ li@@ es the power to the small indi@@ cat@@ or bo@@ x . I call it a trans@@ form@@ er ."
And the indi@@ cat@@ or bo@@ x makes the li@@ ghts fl@@ ash .
"As you can see , the bu@@ l@@ b@@ s face outside , because that &apos;s where the li@@ ons come from ."
And that &apos;s how it looks to li@@ ons when they come at night .
"The li@@ ghts fl@@ ash and tri@@ ck the li@@ ons into thinking I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sle@@ ep@@ ing in my bed ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks .
"So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experi@@ en@@ ced any problem with li@@ ons ."
And my ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing hom@@ es heard about this idea .
One of them was this gran@@ d@@ mother .
"S@@ he had a lot of her animals being kill@@ ed by li@@ ons , and she asked me if I could put the li@@ ghts for her ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; So I put the li@@ ghts . You can see at the back , those are the lion li@@ ghts ."
"S@@ in@@ ce now , I &apos;ve set up se@@ ven hom@@ es around my community , and they &apos;re really working ."
"And my idea is also being used now all over K@@ en@@ y@@ a for sc@@ ar@@ ing other pred@@ at@@ ors like hy@@ en@@ as , le@@ op@@ ar@@ ds , and it &apos;s also being used to sc@@ are ele@@ ph@@ an@@ ts away from people &apos;s far@@ ms ."
"Because of this inv@@ en@@ tion , I was lu@@ ck@@ y to get a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best scho@@ ols in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , B@@ ro@@ ok@@ house Inter@@ national S@@ cho@@ ol , and I &apos;m really exc@@ ited about this ."
My new school now is coming in and hel@@ ping by fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing and cre@@ ating an a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
"I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing the li@@ ghts to the hom@@ es which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teach@@ ing them how to put them ."
"So one year ago , I was just a bo@@ y in the sav@@ an@@ na g@@ ras@@ sl@@ and her@@ ding my father &apos;s co@@ ws , and I used to see plan@@ es fl@@ ying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside ."
And here I am today .
I got a chan@@ ce to come by plan@@ e for my first time for TED .
So my big dre@@ am is to become an air@@ cra@@ ft engine@@ er and p@@ il@@ ot when I grow up .
"I used to h@@ ate li@@ ons , but now because my inv@@ en@@ tion is sav@@ ing my father &apos;s co@@ ws and the li@@ ons , we are able to st@@ ay with the li@@ ons without any conf@@ li@@ ct ."
"A@@ sh@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n . It means in my language , th@@ ank you very much ."

"A@@ t that age , I also learned about what an anim@@ ator was ."
There was a progra@@ m on T@@ V about j@@ ob@@ s most kids don &apos;t know about .

A@@ nim@@ ation and art has always been my first love .
"It was my love for technology that sp@@ ar@@ ked the idea for &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ ici@@ ous D@@ ish@@ es . &quot; &quot; There was a viru@@ s on my computer , and I was trying to get ri@@ d of it , and all of a sud@@ den , I just thought , what if viru@@ ses have their own little world inside the computer ?"
Ma@@ ybe a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant where they me@@ et up and do viru@@ sy things ?
"And th@@ us , &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ ici@@ ous D@@ ish@@ es &quot; &quot; was born ."
"A@@ t four years old , my da@@ d sho@@ wed me how to take a@@ part a computer and put it back together again ."
That started my love for technology .
"I built my first we@@ b@@ s@@ ite myself in H@@ T@@ M@@ L , and I &apos;m learning J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt and P@@ y@@ th@@ on ."
I &apos;m also working on an anim@@ ated seri@@ es called &quot; &quot; The P@@ ol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about be@@ es and other pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
"If plan@@ ts are@@ n &apos;t pol@@ lin@@ ated by the pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors , then all cre@@ at@@ ures , inclu@@ ding ourselves , that de@@ p@@ end on these plan@@ ts , would star@@ ve ."

"( Mu@@ sic ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my anim@@ ations start with ideas , but what are ideas ?"
I@@ de@@ as can sp@@ ar@@ k a movement .
I@@ de@@ as are opport@@ unities and innov@@ ation .
I@@ de@@ as tru@@ ly are what make the world go round .
"If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , medi@@ c@@ ine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives ."
"A@@ t e@@ ight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called Ma@@ y@@ a &apos;s I@@ de@@ as , and my no@@ n@@ prof@@ it , Ma@@ y@@ a &apos;s I@@ de@@ as for the P@@ lan@@ et ."
( Laughter ) And I make ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ en@@ dly clo@@ thing and acc@@ ess@@ ories .

"I was gre@@ at@@ ly inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ced by art , and I wanted to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate it in everything I did , even my business ."
"I would find different f@@ ab@@ ri@@ cs around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a sc@@ ar@@ f or a h@@ at , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for desig@@ ns ."
"I not@@ ic@@ ed when I wor@@ e my cre@@ ations , people would stop me and say , &quot; W@@ ow , that &apos;s really c@@ ute . Wh@@ ere can I get one ? &quot;"
"And I thought , I can start my own business ."
Now I didn &apos;t have any business plan@@ s at only e@@ ight years old .
I only knew I wanted to make pretty cre@@ ations that were sa@@ fe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
"My mom ta@@ u@@ ght me how to se@@ w , and on my back por@@ ch , I would sit and make little he@@ ad@@ ban@@ ds out of ri@@ b@@ b@@ on , and I would write down the na@@ m@@ es and the pri@@ ce of each it@@ em ."

"S@@ o@@ on , my business really started to take off ."
"Th@@ en one day , F@@ or@@ b@@ es magaz@@ ine con@@ ta@@ cted me when I was 10 years old ."
( Laughter ) They wanted to fe@@ ature me and my company in their arti@@ cle .
"Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ en@@ dly ?"
I &apos;ve had a pas@@ sion for prote@@ c@@ ting the environment and its cre@@ at@@ ures since I was little .
My parents ta@@ u@@ ght me at an early age about gi@@ ving back and being a good ste@@ ward to the environment .
"I heard about how the d@@ yes in some clo@@ thing or the process of even making the it@@ ems was har@@ m@@ ful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I discover@@ ed that even after d@@ ye@@ ing has being complet@@ ed , there is a w@@ ast@@ e issue that gi@@ ves a ne@@ g@@ ative imp@@ act on the environment ."
"For example , the g@@ rin@@ ding of materi@@ als , or the dum@@ ping of dri@@ ed po@@ w@@ der materi@@ als ."
"Th@@ ese ac@@ tions can pol@@ l@@ ute the air , making it to@@ x@@ ic to any@@ one or anything that in@@ hal@@ es it ."
"So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my it@@ ems had to be ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ en@@ dly , and 10 to 20 percent of the prof@@ its I made went to local and global ch@@ ar@@ ities and environ@@ mental organiz@@ ations ."
"( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new w@@ ave of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s that not only se@@ eks to have a succ@@ ess@@ ful business , but also a su@@ sta@@ in@@ able future ."
I feel that I can me@@ et the needs of my cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers without com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ing the ability of future gener@@ ations to live in a gre@@ en@@ er tom@@ or@@ row .
"We live in a big , di@@ ver@@ se and beautiful world , and that makes me even more pas@@ sion@@ ate to s@@ ave it ."
But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your he@@ ads about the things that are happening in our world .
"It takes to get it through your hear@@ ts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when move@@ ments are sp@@ ar@@ ked ."
"That is when opport@@ unities and innov@@ ation are created , and that is why ideas come to life ."
"Th@@ ank you , and pe@@ ace and bl@@ es@@ sin@@ gs ."
"( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) P@@ at M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell : So , you heard Ma@@ y@@ a talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredi@@ ble woman . Wh@@ ere are they ?"
"P@@ le@@ ase , M@@ r@@ . and M@@ r@@ s@@ . P@@ en@@ n . W@@ ould you just — A@@ h !"
( Applause )
"You know , one of the in@@ ten@@ se pl@@ eas@@ ures of trav@@ el and one of the deli@@ ghts of e@@ th@@ no@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic research is the opport@@ unity to live am@@ on@@ g@@ st those who have not for@@ got@@ ten the old ways , who still feel their past in the w@@ ind , tou@@ ch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by ra@@ in , ta@@ st@@ e it in the b@@ it@@ ter le@@ av@@ es of plan@@ ts ."
"@@ Ju@@ st to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still jour@@ ney be@@ y@@ ond the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the I@@ nu@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with me@@ an@@ ing , or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ a , the B@@ ud@@ d@@ hist@@ s still pur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the cent@@ ral re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ polo@@ gy , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some absol@@ ute sense , but is just one model of reality , the con@@ sequ@@ ence of one particular set of ada@@ p@@ tive cho@@ ices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it succ@@ ess@@ fully , many gener@@ ations ago ."
"And of course , we all share the same ada@@ p@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ ves ."
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through in@@ iti@@ ation rit@@ es .
"We have to de@@ al with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of de@@ ath , so it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t surpri@@ se us that we all sing , we all dan@@ ce , we all have art ."
"But what &apos;s interesting is the uni@@ qu@@ e c@@ ad@@ ence of the s@@ ong , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the dan@@ ce in every culture ."
"And whether it is the P@@ en@@ an in the fore@@ sts of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the Vo@@ od@@ o@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the Ka@@ is@@ ut des@@ er@@ t of Nor@@ ther@@ n K@@ en@@ y@@ a , the C@@ ur@@ an@@ der@@ o in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ des , or a ca@@ rav@@ an@@ ser@@ a@@ i in the middle of the S@@ a@@ har@@ a — this is in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally the fel@@ low that I trav@@ el@@ ed into the des@@ er@@ t with a mon@@ th ago — or inde@@ ed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the slo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , E@@ ver@@ est , the god@@ d@@ ess mother of the world ."
"A@@ ll of these pe@@ o@@ ples te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing y@@ ourself in the Earth ."
"And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only f@@ ill you with hope ."
"Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a we@@ b of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual life and cul@@ tu@@ ral life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the planet , and is as important to the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the planet as inde@@ ed is the biolog@@ ical we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere ."
"And you might think of this cul@@ tu@@ ral we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here , and you might def@@ ine the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here as being the su@@ m tot@@ al of all thou@@ ghts and dre@@ am@@ s , my@@ ths , ideas , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ations , in@@ tu@@ itions b@@ rou@@ ght into being by the human imag@@ in@@ ation since the da@@ wn of consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess ."
The e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here is hum@@ an@@ ity &apos;s great leg@@ ac@@ y .
It &apos;s the sym@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qu@@ is@@ itive species .
"And just as the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere has been sever@@ ely er@@ od@@ ed , so too is the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here — and , if anything , at a far gre@@ ater rate ."
"No biologi@@ sts , for example , would d@@ are su@@ gg@@ est that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ in@@ k of ex@@ tin@@ ction because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most a@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ c sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the re@@ al@@ m of biolog@@ ical di@@ vers@@ ity — sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely appro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ tim@@ ist@@ ic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the re@@ al@@ m of cul@@ tu@@ ral di@@ vers@@ ity ."
"And the great indi@@ cat@@ or of that , of course , is language lo@@ s@@ s ."
"When each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages spo@@ k@@ en on the planet ."
"Now , a language is not just a body of vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ m@@ ati@@ cal ru@@ les ."
A language is a fl@@ ash of the human spi@@ ri@@ t .
It &apos;s a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
"E@@ very language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth fore@@ st of the mind , a wat@@ ersh@@ ed , a thought , an ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual pos@@ sibil@@ ities ."
"And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages , as we sit here today in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ pered into the ear@@ s of children ."
"They &apos;re no longer being ta@@ u@@ ght to bab@@ ies , which means , effec@@ ti@@ vely , un@@ less something changes , they &apos;re already de@@ ad ."
"What could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pas@@ s on the w@@ is@@ dom of the an@@ c@@ est@@ ors or anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate the pro@@ mi@@ se of the children ?"
"And yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is inde@@ ed the p@@ light of somebody some@@ where on Earth rou@@ gh@@ ly every two we@@ eks , because every two we@@ eks , some el@@ der di@@ es and car@@ ri@@ es with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ l@@ lab@@ les of an an@@ ci@@ ent ton@@ gu@@ e ."
"And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spo@@ ke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at , let &apos;s make that language Y@@ oru@@ ba . Let &apos;s make it C@@ an@@ ton@@ ese ."
Let &apos;s make it K@@ og@@ i . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll sud@@ den@@ ly disc@@ over what it would be like to be u@@ na@@ ble to speak your own language .
"And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here , a bri@@ e@@ f jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here , to try to beg@@ in to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost ."
"Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being ."
"Ta@@ ke , for example , this child of a B@@ a@@ ras@@ ana in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ olog@@ ically they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the e@@ ast in the bel@@ ly of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ na@@ k@@ es ."
"Now , this is a people who c@@ og@@ n@@ iti@@ vely do not dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish the col@@ or bl@@ ue from the col@@ or gre@@ en because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the fore@@ st u@@ po@@ n which the people de@@ p@@ end ."
They have a cu@@ ri@@ ous language and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called &quot; &quot; lin@@ gu@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ og@@ a@@ my : &quot; &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spe@@ ak@@ s a different language .
"And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ olog@@ ical past , yet the cu@@ ri@@ ous thing is in these long hou@@ ses , where there are six or se@@ ven langu@@ ages spo@@ k@@ en because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never hear any@@ one pra@@ cti@@ cing a language ."
They simply list@@ en and then beg@@ in to speak .
"O@@ r , one of the most f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating tri@@ b@@ es I ever li@@ ved with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing people first con@@ ta@@ cted pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly in 19@@ 5@@ 8 ."
"In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ ari@@ es at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted con@@ ta@@ ct and made a c@@ rit@@ ical mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
"They dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 g@@ lo@@ s@@ sy photogra@@ ph@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be fri@@ en@@ dly g@@ est@@ ures , for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st had never seen anything tw@@ o-@@ d@@ imen@@ si@@ onal in their lives ."
"They pic@@ ked up these photogra@@ ph@@ s from the fore@@ st flo@@ or , tri@@ ed to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and con@@ clu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the de@@ vil , so they spe@@ a@@ red the five mis@@ sion@@ ari@@ es to de@@ ath ."
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar outsi@@ ders .
They spe@@ a@@ red each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them spe@@ ar@@ ing each other .
"We tra@@ ced gen@@ e@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back e@@ ight gener@@ ations , and we found two in@@ stan@@ ces of natural de@@ ath and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had got@@ ten so old that he di@@ ed getting old , so we spe@@ a@@ red him any@@ way . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ i@@ ous knowled@@ ge of the fore@@ st that was ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing ."
Th@@ e@@ ir hun@@ ters could sm@@ ell anim@@ al ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
"In the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , I had a really ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment when I was asked by my prof@@ ess@@ or at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard if I was interest@@ ed in going down to H@@ a@@ it@@ i , inf@@ il@@ tr@@ ating the se@@ cre@@ t soci@@ et@@ ies which were the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of D@@ uv@@ ali@@ er &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ on@@ ton M@@ ac@@ out@@ es , and se@@ cur@@ ing the pois@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es ."
"In order to make sense out of sen@@ s@@ ation , of course , I had to understand something about this rem@@ ar@@ ka@@ ble fa@@ ith of V@@ od@@ ou@@ n . And Vo@@ od@@ o@@ o is not a black ma@@ gic cul@@ t ."
"On the con@@ tra@@ ry , it &apos;s a complex met@@ ap@@ h@@ ysi@@ cal wor@@ l@@ dvi@@ ew ."
It &apos;s interesting .
"If I asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?"
"Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , I@@ s@@ la@@ m , B@@ ud@@ d@@ h@@ ism , Ju@@ da@@ ism , what@@ ever ."
"There &apos;s always one contin@@ ent left out , the as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ ha@@ ran Africa had no religi@@ ous beli@@ ef@@ s . Well , of course , they did and Vo@@ od@@ o@@ o is simply the dist@@ ill@@ ation of these very pro@@ found religi@@ ous ideas that came over during the tra@@ gic D@@ i@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sl@@ av@@ ery era ."
"But , what makes Vo@@ od@@ o@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relation@@ ship between the living and the de@@ ad ."
"So , the living give bir@@ th to the sp@@ ir@@ its ."
"The sp@@ ir@@ its can be in@@ vo@@ ked from ben@@ e@@ ath the Gre@@ at W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the dan@@ ce to momen@@ tar@@ ily dis@@ place the s@@ ou@@ l of the living , so that for that bri@@ e@@ f sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te be@@ comes the god ."
That &apos;s why the Vo@@ od@@ o@@ o@@ ist@@ s like to say that &quot; &quot; You white people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and speak about G@@ od .
"We dan@@ ce in the tem@@ ple and become G@@ od . &quot; &quot; And because you are pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed , you are taken by the spi@@ ri@@ t — how can you be har@@ med ?"
"So you see these ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing demon@@ str@@ ations : Vo@@ od@@ o@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es in a state of tran@@ ce han@@ dl@@ ing bur@@ ning em@@ bers with imp@@ unity , a rather ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing demon@@ str@@ ation of the ability of the mind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ar@@ s it when cat@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed in the state of ex@@ tre@@ me exc@@ it@@ ation ."
"Now , of all the pe@@ o@@ ples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extra@@ ordin@@ ary are the K@@ og@@ i of the S@@ i@@ er@@ ra Ne@@ va@@ da de S@@ an@@ ta Mar@@ ta in nor@@ ther@@ n C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a ."
"D@@ es@@ c@@ en@@ dan@@ ts of the an@@ ci@@ ent Ta@@ i@@ ro@@ na ci@@ viliz@@ ation which once car@@ p@@ et@@ ed the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a , in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ c@@ ani@@ c mas@@ si@@ f that so@@ ar@@ s ab@@ ov@@ e the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in ."
"In a blo@@ od@@ sta@@ ined contin@@ ent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed by the S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"To this day , they re@@ ma@@ in ru@@ led by a rit@@ ual pri@@ es@@ th@@ o@@ od but the tra@@ ining for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ o@@ od is rather extra@@ ordin@@ ary ."
"The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es are taken away from their famili@@ es at the age of three and four , sequ@@ ester@@ ed in a sha@@ do@@ w@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one h@@ ut@@ s at the b@@ ase of gl@@ ac@@ i@@ ers for 18 years : two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year peri@@ od@@ s deli@@ ber@@ ately cho@@ se@@ n to m@@ im@@ ic the n@@ ine months of g@@ est@@ ation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother ."
"And for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ ues of their society , val@@ ues that ma@@ in@@ tain the pro@@ pos@@ ition that their pra@@ y@@ ers and their pra@@ y@@ ers alone ma@@ in@@ tain the c@@ os@@ mic — or we might say the ec@@ olog@@ ical — bal@@ ance ."
"And at the end of this amazing in@@ iti@@ ation , one day they &apos;re sud@@ den@@ ly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a su@@ n@@ ri@@ se . And in that c@@ ry@@ stal moment of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first light as the Su@@ n beg@@ ins to ba@@ the the slo@@ p@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly beautiful lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape , sud@@ den@@ ly everything they have learned in the ab@@ stra@@ ct is af@@ fi@@ r@@ med in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ ory . And the pri@@ est step@@ s back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you ."
"It is that beautiful . It is y@@ ours to prote@@ ct . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; el@@ der bro@@ thers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the youn@@ ger bro@@ thers , are the ones respon@@ sible for dest@@ ro@@ ying the world ."
"Now , this level of in@@ tu@@ ition be@@ comes very important ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape , we ei@@ ther in@@ vo@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; &quot; no@@ ble sav@@ age , &quot; &quot; which is an idea rac@@ ist in its sim@@ p@@ lic@@ ity , or al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ vely , we in@@ vo@@ ke Th@@ ore@@ a@@ u and say these people are clo@@ s@@ er to the Earth than we are ."
"Well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther sent@@ imen@@ tal no@@ r we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by nost@@ al@@ gi@@ a ."
"There &apos;s not a lot of room for ei@@ ther in the mal@@ ari@@ al sw@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing win@@ ds of T@@ i@@ b@@ et , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , through time and rit@@ ual , for@@ g@@ ed a trad@@ iti@@ onal my@@ sti@@ qu@@ e of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ l@@ er in@@ tu@@ ition : the idea that the Earth itself can only ex@@ ist because it is bre@@ a@@ th@@ ed into being by human consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess ."
"Now , what does that mean ?"
It means that a young ki@@ d from the An@@ des who &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that m@@ oun@@ tain is an Ap@@ u spi@@ ri@@ t that will direc@@ t his or her dest@@ iny will be a prof@@ oun@@ dly different human being and have a different relation@@ ship to that resour@@ ce or that place than a young ki@@ d from M@@ on@@ t@@ ana ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a m@@ oun@@ tain is a p@@ ile of ro@@ ck ready to be min@@ ed .
Wh@@ e@@ ther it &apos;s the ab@@ ode of a spi@@ ri@@ t or a p@@ ile of ore is ir@@ re@@ lev@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or that de@@ fin@@ es the relation@@ ship between the individu@@ al and the natural world .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the fore@@ sts of B@@ rit@@ ish C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those fore@@ sts exist@@ ed to be c@@ ut .
"That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ g@@ st the K@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those fore@@ sts were the ab@@ ode of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ ok@@ ed B@@ e@@ ak of H@@ e@@ av@@ en and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al sp@@ ir@@ its that d@@ w@@ ell@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the world , sp@@ ir@@ its they would have to eng@@ age during their H@@ am@@ at@@ sa in@@ iti@@ ation ."
"Now , if you beg@@ in to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different re@@ al@@ ities , you could beg@@ in to understand some of their extra@@ ordin@@ ary disc@@ ov@@ eri@@ es . Ta@@ ke this plant here ."
It &apos;s a photogra@@ ph I took in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pri@@ l .
"This is a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ac@@ tive pre@@ par@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re ."
"What makes a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating is not the she@@ er ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ olog@@ ical pot@@ ential of this pre@@ par@@ ation , but the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sour@@ ces : on the one hand , this wo@@ ody li@@ ana which has in it a seri@@ es of bet@@ a-@@ car@@ bol@@ ines , har@@ m@@ ine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ og@@ eni@@ c — to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of bl@@ ue ha@@ zy s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess — but it &apos;s mi@@ x@@ ed with the le@@ av@@ es of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ ee family called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is ."
"This plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ min@@ es , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , d@@ ime@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ m@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ d@@ ime@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ m@@ ine ."
"If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ ses , that sub@@ stance they make from a different set of species also con@@ ta@@ ins me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ d@@ ime@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ m@@ ine ."
T@@ o have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your no@@ se is rather like being sh@@ ot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with ba@@ ro@@ qu@@ e pain@@ tin@@ gs and lan@@ ding on a se@@ a of electri@@ city . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the dist@@ or@@ tion of reality ; it cre@@ ates the dis@@ solution of reality .
"In fact , I used to argu@@ e with my prof@@ ess@@ or , R@@ ich@@ ard E@@ v@@ an Sh@@ ul@@ t@@ es — who is a man who sp@@ ar@@ ked the p@@ sy@@ che@@ del@@ ic era with his discover@@ y of the ma@@ gic mu@@ sh@@ ro@@ om@@ s in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s — I used to argu@@ e that you couldn &apos;t clas@@ si@@ fy these tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ min@@ es as h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ og@@ eni@@ c because by the time you &apos;re under the effec@@ ts there &apos;s no one home any@@ more to experience a h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ ation . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ min@@ es is they can@@ not be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an en@@ zy@@ me found nat@@ ur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mo@@ no@@ am@@ ine o@@ x@@ i@@ da@@ se ."
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ ju@@ n@@ ction with some other chem@@ ical that den@@ at@@ ures the M@@ A@@ O .
"Now , the f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating things are that the bet@@ a-@@ car@@ bol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ors of the pre@@ ci@@ se sort ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ary to pot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ p@@ ta@@ m@@ ine . So you ask y@@ ourself a question ."
"H@@ ow , in a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0,000 species of v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar plan@@ ts , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ olog@@ ically un@@ rel@@ ated plan@@ ts that when com@@ b@@ ined in this way , created a kind of bi@@ och@@ em@@ ical ver@@ sion of the whole being gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the parts ?"
"Well , we use that great e@@ u@@ ph@@ em@@ ism , &quot; &quot; tri@@ al and er@@ ro@@ r , &quot; &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be me@@ an@@ in@@ gl@@ ess ."
"But you ask the Indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; &quot; The plan@@ ts talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?"
"This tri@@ be , the C@@ of@@ an , has 1@@ 7 vari@@ et@@ ies of a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish a great di@@ stance in the fore@@ st , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our e@@ ye as one species ."
"And then you ask them how they est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh their ta@@ x@@ ono@@ my and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about plan@@ ts ."
"I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 vari@@ et@@ ies in the night of a full mo@@ on , and it sin@@ gs to you in a different key ."
"Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ ens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ th@@ et@@ ic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ a@@ in@@ t and col@@ or@@ ful but some@@ how re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , me@@ an@@ ing our world , mo@@ ves on ."
"Well , the tru@@ th is the 20@@ th century , 3@@ 00 years from now , is not going to be rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed for its war@@ s or its technolo@@ g@@ ical innov@@ ations , but rather as the era in which we sto@@ od by and ei@@ ther ac@@ ti@@ vely en@@ d@@ or@@ sed or pas@@ si@@ vely acc@@ ep@@ ted the mas@@ sive dest@@ ru@@ ction of both biolog@@ ical and cul@@ tu@@ ral di@@ vers@@ ity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change ."
All cul@@ tures through all time have con@@ stan@@ tly been eng@@ ag@@ ed in a dan@@ ce with new pos@@ sibil@@ ities of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .

So I started plan@@ ning how to help them es@@ cap@@ e .
I was so surpri@@ sed that a tot@@ al stran@@ ger ca@@ red enough to ask .
I realized that this was a sym@@ bol@@ ic moment in my life .
( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause )
This is a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten we desig@@ ned in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten to be a cir@@ cle .
It &apos;s a kind of en@@ dl@@ ess cir@@ cul@@ ation on top of the ro@@ of .
"If you are a par@@ ent , you know that kids love to keep making cir@@ cl@@ es ."
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we design this ?
"The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al of this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a han@@ dra@@ il . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ sist@@ ed : &quot; &quot; How about having a net st@@ ic@@ king out from the ed@@ ge of the ro@@ of ?"
"So that it can cat@@ ch the children f@@ all@@ ing off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government off@@ ici@@ al said , &quot; O@@ f course you have to have a han@@ dra@@ il . &quot;"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es po@@ pp@@ ing through .
And we were allo@@ wed to call this ro@@ pe as a han@@ dra@@ il .
"But of course , ro@@ pe has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ omet@@ imes 40 children are around a tre@@ e .
"The bo@@ y on the b@@ ran@@ ch , he lov@@ es the tre@@ e so he is e@@ ating the tre@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they sit on the ed@@ ge ."
It looks so ni@@ ce from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys in the z@@ o@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ ed@@ ing time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the c@@ e@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g wa@@ sh@@ ing place — there are many kinds of water ta@@ ps .
"You see with the fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble tu@@ b@@ es , you want to spra@@ y water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in front is quite norm@@ al ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not wa@@ sh@@ ing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s put@@ ting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
So there is no ac@@ ou@@ st@@ ic bar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qui@@ et bo@@ x , some of them get really ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ v@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary .
"And the prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to st@@ ay in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally , because it &apos;s a cir@@ cle , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of oc@@ ca@@ sion , u@@ su@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ dly , we consi@@ der no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children sle@@ ep better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t sle@@ ep in a qui@@ et space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , these children show amazing con@@ cent@@ r@@ ation in clas@@ s ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the ju@@ n@@ g@@ le with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not sup@@ posed to be in sil@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control ."
"You know , it &apos;s completely open ."
And you should know that we can go s@@ ki@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in win@@ ter .
In sum@@ mer you go sw@@ im@@ ming .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
"And also , you should know that you are wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of ."
You never mel@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are sup@@ posed to be outside ."
So that is how we should tre@@ at them .
This is how they di@@ vide clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
They are sup@@ posed to help teach@@ ers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A clas@@ s@@ room .
And a wa@@ sh@@ bas@@ in .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the clas@@ s@@ room .
A mon@@ key trying to fish another mon@@ key from ab@@ ov@@ e .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each clas@@ s@@ room has at least one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ an@@ ta C@@ lau@@ s comes down at the time of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that ov@@ al@@ -@@ sh@@ ap@@ ed kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten ."
The building is only five met@@ ers t@@ all with se@@ ven flo@@ ors .
"And of course , the c@@ e@@ il@@ ing he@@ ight is very low ."
So you have to consi@@ der sa@@ f@@ ety .
"So , we put our children , a d@@ aughter and a son ."
They tri@@ ed to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s o@@ kay . H@@ is sk@@ ul@@ l is quite stron@@ g .
He is res@@ ili@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to ju@@ m@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ f@@ fic jam is aw@@ ful in T@@ ok@@ y@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in front , she needs to learn how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now these days , kids need a small do@@ sage of dan@@ ger ."
"And in this kind of oc@@ ca@@ sion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of opport@@ unity we are lo@@ sing these days .
"Now , this dra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the movement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
And the cir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence of this building is 1@@ 8@@ 3 met@@ ers .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 met@@ ers in the mor@@ ning ."
But the surpri@@ se is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 met@@ ers on aver@@ age ."
And these children have the high@@ est a@@ th@@ let@@ ic abil@@ ities am@@ ong many kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ s .
"The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
Ju@@ st like she@@ ep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep ru@@ n@@ ning . ( Laughter )
"My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t prote@@ ct them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble sometimes ."
They need to get some in@@ ju@@ ry .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
"I think ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ture is cap@@ able of chang@@ ing this world , and people &apos;s lives ."
And this is one of the at@@ tem@@ p@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Here are some images of clu@@ st@@ ers of gal@@ a@@ x@@ ies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
"They are these huge colle@@ ctions of gal@@ a@@ x@@ ies , b@@ ound together by their mu@@ tual g@@ rav@@ ity ."
"So most of the poin@@ ts that you see on the scre@@ en are not individu@@ al star@@ s , but colle@@ ctions of star@@ s , or gal@@ a@@ x@@ ies ."
"Now , by sho@@ wing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that gal@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are these beautiful ob@@ jects , but more than that , I think gal@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous , they are surpri@@ sing , and they &apos;re u@@ se@@ ful ."
U@@ se@@ ful as the universe &apos;s most mas@@ sive laborat@@ ories .
"And as laborat@@ ories , to descri@@ be gal@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers is to descri@@ be the experim@@ ents that you can do with them ."
"And I think there are four maj@@ or ty@@ p@@ es , and the first ty@@ pe that I want to descri@@ be is prob@@ ing the very big ."
"So , how big ?"
"Well , here is an image of a particular gal@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster ."
"It is so mas@@ sive that the light pas@@ sing through it is being b@@ ent , it &apos;s being dist@@ or@@ ted by the ex@@ tre@@ me g@@ rav@@ ity of this clu@@ ster ."
"And , in fact , if you look very care@@ fully you &apos;ll be able to see r@@ ings around this clu@@ ster ."
"Now , to give you a number , this particular gal@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster has a mas@@ s of over one million billion su@@ ns ."
It &apos;s just min@@ d-@@ bog@@ gl@@ ing how mas@@ sive these systems can get .
"But more than their mas@@ s , they have this add@@ iti@@ onal fe@@ ature ."
"They are es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally is@@ ol@@ ated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sion of the entire universe ."
"And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large sc@@ al@@ es , such as , how does g@@ rav@@ ity work ?"
might be ans@@ wer@@ ed by stud@@ ying these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very ho@@ t .
"O@@ kay , if I take an image of a gal@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster , and I sub@@ tra@@ ct away all of the star@@ light , what I &apos;m left with is this big , bl@@ ue blo@@ b ."
This is in f@@ al@@ se col@@ or .
It &apos;s actually X@@ -@@ ra@@ y light that we &apos;re seeing .
"And the question is , if it &apos;s not gal@@ a@@ x@@ ies , what is em@@ it@@ ting this light ?"
"The answer is ho@@ t g@@ as , milli@@ on@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e g@@ as — in fact , it &apos;s pl@@ as@@ ma ."
And the reason why it &apos;s so ho@@ t goes back to the pre@@ vi@@ ous sli@@ de .
"The ex@@ tre@@ me g@@ rav@@ ity of these systems is acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating parti@@ cl@@ es of g@@ as to great spe@@ ed@@ s , and great spe@@ ed@@ s means great temper@@ at@@ ures ."
"So this is the ma@@ in idea , but science is a rou@@ gh dra@@ ft ."
"There are many ba@@ sic pro@@ per@@ ti@@ es about this pl@@ as@@ ma that still con@@ fu@@ se us , still pu@@ z@@ z@@ le us , and still pus@@ h our under@@ standing of the physi@@ cs of the very ho@@ t ."
Th@@ ird thing : prob@@ ing the very small .
"Now , to expla@@ in this , I need to tell you a very dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing fact ."
Mo@@ st of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of atom@@ s .
You were li@@ ed to .
"Mo@@ st of it is made up of something very , very my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous , which we call dar@@ k matter ."
"D@@ ar@@ k matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to inter@@ act very much , exc@@ ept through g@@ rav@@ ity , and of course we would like to learn more about it ."
"If you &apos;re a parti@@ cle physi@@ c@@ ist , you want to know what happens when we sm@@ ash things together ."
And dar@@ k matter is no exc@@ ep@@ tion .
"Well , how do we do this ?"
"To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when gal@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers col@@ li@@ de ?"
Here is an image .
"S@@ in@@ ce gal@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative sli@@ ces of the universe , sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sions ."
"They are mo@@ st@@ ly made up of dar@@ k matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this bl@@ u@@ ish pur@@ ple ."
"The red re@@ pres@@ ents the ho@@ t g@@ as , and , of course , you can see many gal@@ a@@ x@@ ies ."
"What &apos;s happened is a parti@@ cle acc@@ el@@ er@@ ator at a huge , huge scale ."
"And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effec@@ ts that might be difficult to det@@ ect in the la@@ b , might be com@@ po@@ un@@ ded and com@@ po@@ un@@ ded into something that we could pos@@ si@@ bly ob@@ ser@@ ve in nature ."
"So , it &apos;s very fun@@ ny ."
"The reason why gal@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers can te@@ ach us about dar@@ k matter , the reason why gal@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers can te@@ ach us about the physi@@ cs of the very small , is pre@@ c@@ is@@ ely because they are so very big ."
F@@ our@@ th thing : the physi@@ cs of the very stran@@ ge .
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly what I &apos;ve said so far is c@@ raz@@ y .
"O@@ kay , if there &apos;s anything stran@@ ger I think it has to be dar@@ k energy ."
"If I th@@ row a b@@ all into the air , I expe@@ ct it to go up ."
What I don &apos;t expe@@ ct is that it go up at an ever@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing rate .
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , c@@ os@@ m@@ ologi@@ sts understand why the universe is ex@@ pan@@ ding ."
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s ex@@ pan@@ ding at an ever@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing rate .
"They give the c@@ ause of this acc@@ el@@ er@@ ated ex@@ pan@@ sion a name , and they call it dar@@ k energy ."
"And , again , we want to learn more about it ."
"So , one particular question that we have is , how does dar@@ k energy aff@@ ect the universe at the lar@@ g@@ est sc@@ al@@ es ?"
"D@@ ep@@ en@@ ding on how stron@@ g it is , maybe structure form@@ s f@@ aster or slo@@ wer ."
"Well , the problem with the lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ bly comp@@ lic@@ ated ."
Here is a computer sim@@ ul@@ ation .
And we need a way to sim@@ pli@@ fy it .
"Well , I like to think about this using an anal@@ og@@ y ."
"If I want to understand the sin@@ king of the T@@ it@@ ani@@ c , the most important thing to do is not to model the little pos@@ itions of every single little piece of the bo@@ at that bro@@ ke off ."
The most important thing to do is to tra@@ ck the two bi@@ gg@@ est parts .
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the lar@@ g@@ est sc@@ al@@ es by tra@@ c@@ king its bi@@ gg@@ est pi@@ ec@@ es and those bi@@ gg@@ est pi@@ ec@@ es are clu@@ st@@ ers of gal@@ a@@ x@@ ies ."
"So , as I come to a close , you might feel sli@@ gh@@ tly che@@ ated ."
"I mean , I beg@@ an by talking about how gal@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are u@@ se@@ ful , and I &apos;ve given some reas@@ ons , but what is their use really ?"
"Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quot@@ e by H@@ en@@ ry F@@ or@@ d when he was asked about car@@ s ."

"A@@ t the time , I was car@@ di@@ olog@@ ist at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , speci@@ aliz@@ ing in car@@ di@@ a@@ c imag@@ ing tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es ."
The call came from a vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ an at the L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es Z@@ o@@ o .
A@@ n el@@ der@@ ly f@@ em@@ ale ch@@ im@@ pan@@ z@@ ee had w@@ ok@@ en up with a fac@@ i@@ al dro@@ op and the vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were wor@@ ri@@ ed that she &apos;d had a stro@@ ke .
They asked if I &apos;d come to the z@@ o@@ o and image the anim@@ al &apos;s heart to look for a possible car@@ di@@ a@@ c c@@ ause .
"Now , to be clear , Nor@@ th American z@@ o@@ os are sta@@ ff@@ ed by high@@ ly qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ed , bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans who take out@@ standing care of their anim@@ al patients ."
"But oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally , they do re@@ ach into the human medi@@ cal community , particul@@ arly for some speci@@ ality con@@ sul@@ t@@ ation , and I was one of the lu@@ ck@@ y physi@@ ci@@ ans who was inv@@ ited in to help ."
"I had a chan@@ ce to ru@@ le out a stro@@ ke in this ch@@ im@@ pan@@ z@@ ee and make sure that this gor@@ ill@@ a didn &apos;t have a tor@@ n a@@ or@@ ta , ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate this m@@ ac@@ a@@ w for a heart m@@ ur@@ mu@@ r , make sure that this C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a se@@ a lion &apos;s par@@ ic@@ ar@@ di@@ um wasn &apos;t inf@@ l@@ am@@ ed , and in this picture , I &apos;m list@@ ening to the heart of a lion after a li@@ f@@ es@@ av@@ ing , col@@ labor@@ ative proc@@ ed@@ ure with vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans and physi@@ ci@@ ans where we dra@@ ined 7@@ 00 c@@ c &apos;s of f@@ lu@@ id from the sa@@ c in which this lion &apos;s heart was con@@ ta@@ ined ."
"And this proc@@ ed@@ ure , which I have done on many human patients , was id@@ enti@@ cal , with the exc@@ ep@@ tion of that pa@@ w and that ta@@ il ."
"Now most of the time , I was working at U@@ C@@ L@@ A M@@ e@@ di@@ cal C@@ ent@@ er with physi@@ ci@@ ans , disc@@ us@@ sing sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s and diag@@ no@@ ses and tre@@ at@@ ments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es Z@@ o@@ o with vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans , disc@@ us@@ sing sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s and diag@@ no@@ ses and tre@@ at@@ ments for their anim@@ al patients ."
"And oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally , on the very same day , I went on ro@@ un@@ ds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A M@@ e@@ di@@ cal C@@ ent@@ er and at the L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es Z@@ o@@ o ."
And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear foc@@ us for me .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans and vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally taking care of the same dis@@ or@@ ders in their anim@@ al and human patients : con@@ g@@ esti@@ ve heart fa@@ il@@ ure , brain tu@@ mor@@ s , le@@ u@@ k@@ em@@ ia , di@@ ab@@ et@@ es , ar@@ th@@ rit@@ is , A@@ L@@ S , bre@@ ast cancer , even p@@ sy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dro@@ m@@ es like depres@@ sion , an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , comp@@ ul@@ sions , e@@ ating dis@@ or@@ ders and self-@@ in@@ ju@@ ry ."
"Now , I &apos;ve got a conf@@ es@@ sion to make ."
"E@@ ven though I studi@@ ed com@@ par@@ ative physi@@ olog@@ y and evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary biolog@@ y as an under@@ gra@@ d — I had even writ@@ ten my s@@ eni@@ or th@@ es@@ is on D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ an the@@ ory — learning about the sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant over@@ la@@ p between the dis@@ or@@ ders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed w@@ ak@@ e-@@ up call for me ."
"So I started wonder@@ ing , with all of these over@@ la@@ ps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ an , or con@@ sul@@ t the vet@@ er@@ in@@ ary liter@@ ature , for in@@ si@@ ghts into one of my human patients ?"
"Wh@@ y had I never , no@@ r had any of my physi@@ ci@@ an friends and colle@@ ag@@ ues wh@@ om I asked , ever atten@@ ded a vet@@ er@@ in@@ ary con@@ fer@@ ence ?"
"For that matter , why was any of this a surpri@@ se ?"
"I mean , look , every single physi@@ ci@@ an acc@@ ep@@ ts some biolog@@ ical conne@@ ction between animals and humans ."
E@@ very medi@@ c@@ ation that we pres@@ cri@@ be or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our famili@@ es has first been test@@ ed on an anim@@ al .
But there &apos;s something very different about gi@@ ving an anim@@ al a medi@@ c@@ ation or a human disease and the anim@@ al develop@@ ing con@@ g@@ esti@@ ve heart fa@@ il@@ ure or di@@ ab@@ et@@ es or bre@@ ast cancer on their own .
"Now , maybe some of the surpri@@ se comes from the incre@@ as@@ ing se@@ par@@ ation in our world between the ur@@ b@@ an and the no@@ n@@ ur@@ b@@ an ."
"You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wo@@ ol gro@@ ws on tre@@ es or that che@@ ese comes from a plant ."
"Well , today &apos;s human hosp@@ it@@ als , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly , are tur@@ ning into these g@@ le@@ am@@ ing ca@@ the@@ d@@ r@@ als of technology ."
And this cre@@ ates a p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical di@@ stance between the human patients who are being tre@@ ated there and anim@@ al patients who are living in oc@@ e@@ ans and far@@ ms and ju@@ n@@ gl@@ es .
But I think there &apos;s an even de@@ ep@@ er reason .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans and scientists , we acc@@ ept intel@@ le@@ c@@ tually that our species , H@@ om@@ o sa@@ pi@@ ens , is mer@@ ely one species , no more uni@@ qu@@ e or speci@@ al than any other ."
"But in our hear@@ ts , we don &apos;t completely believe that ."
I feel it myself when I &apos;m list@@ ening to M@@ oz@@ art or looking at pic@@ tures of the Mar@@ s R@@ over on my M@@ ac@@ Bo@@ ok .
"I feel that tu@@ g of human exc@@ ep@@ tion@@ al@@ ism , even as I recogniz@@ e the scienti@@ fic@@ ally is@@ ol@@ ating cost of seeing ourselves as a su@@ peri@@ or species , a@@ part ."
"Well , I &apos;m trying these days ."
"When I see a human pati@@ ent now , I always ask , what do the anim@@ al doc@@ tors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?"
"And , might I be taking better care of my human pati@@ ent if I saw them as a human anim@@ al pati@@ ent ?"
Here are a few exam@@ ples of the kind of exc@@ iting conne@@ ctions that this kind of thinking has led me to .
F@@ ear@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed heart fa@@ il@@ ure .
"A@@ round the year 20@@ 00 , human car@@ di@@ ologi@@ sts &quot; &quot; discover@@ ed &quot; &quot; emot@@ i@@ on@@ ally in@@ duc@@ ed heart fa@@ il@@ ure ."
"It was descri@@ bed in a g@@ am@@ bl@@ ing father who had lost his life &apos;s sav@@ ings with a ro@@ ll of the di@@ ce , in a bri@@ de who &apos;d been left at the al@@ ter ."
"But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diag@@ nos@@ is was ne@@ i@@ ther new , no@@ r was it uni@@ qu@@ ely human ."
"V@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans had been diag@@ no@@ sing , tre@@ ating and even prev@@ ent@@ ing emot@@ i@@ on@@ ally in@@ duc@@ ed sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s in animals ran@@ ging from mon@@ ke@@ ys to fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , from to de@@ er to rab@@ b@@ its , since the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
How many human lives might have been sav@@ ed if this vet@@ er@@ in@@ ary knowled@@ ge had been put into the hands of E@@ .@@ R@@ . do@@ cs and car@@ di@@ ologi@@ sts ?
S@@ el@@ f-@@ in@@ ju@@ ry .
S@@ ome human patients har@@ m themselves .
"S@@ ome pl@@ u@@ ck out pat@@ ch@@ es of ha@@ ir , others actually c@@ ut themselves ."
S@@ ome anim@@ al patients also har@@ m themselves .
There are bir@@ ds that pl@@ u@@ ck out fe@@ a@@ thers .
There are st@@ al@@ li@@ ons that re@@ p@@ et@@ iti@@ vely b@@ ite their f@@ lan@@ ks until they b@@ le@@ ed .
But vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have very speci@@ fic and very effec@@ tive ways of tre@@ ating and even prev@@ ent@@ ing self-@@ in@@ ju@@ ry in their self-@@ in@@ ju@@ r@@ ing animals .
Sh@@ ouldn &apos;t this vet@@ er@@ in@@ ary knowled@@ ge be put into the hands of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ther@@ ap@@ ist@@ s and parents and patients stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with self-@@ in@@ ju@@ ry ?
P@@ ost@@ par@@ tu@@ m depres@@ sion and post@@ par@@ tu@@ m p@@ sy@@ ch@@ os@@ is .
"S@@ omet@@ imes , so@@ on after gi@@ ving bir@@ th , some women become depres@@ sed , and sometimes they become seri@@ ously depres@@ sed and even p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ic ."
"They may ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct their ne@@ w@@ born , and in some ex@@ tre@@ me c@@ ases , even har@@ m the child ."
"E@@ qu@@ ine vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans also know that oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally , a m@@ are , so@@ on after gi@@ ving bir@@ th , will ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct the fo@@ al , re@@ f@@ using to n@@ ur@@ se , and in some in@@ stan@@ ces , k@@ ick the fo@@ al , even to de@@ ath ."
But vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have de@@ vis@@ ed an inter@@ ven@@ tion to de@@ al with this fo@@ al re@@ jec@@ tion sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me that invol@@ ves incre@@ as@@ ing o@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in in the m@@ are .
"O@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in is the b@@ on@@ ding hor@@ m@@ one , and this lea@@ ds to ren@@ e@@ wed inter@@ est , on the part of the m@@ are , in her fo@@ al ."
Sh@@ ouldn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of ob / g@@ y@@ n &apos;s and family doc@@ tors and patients who are stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with post@@ par@@ tu@@ m depres@@ sion and p@@ sy@@ ch@@ os@@ is ?
"Well , des@@ p@@ ite all of this pro@@ mi@@ se , un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately the g@@ ul@@ f between our fiel@@ ds re@@ ma@@ ins large ."
"To expla@@ in it , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;m going to have to air some di@@ r@@ ty lau@@ n@@ d@@ ry ."
S@@ ome physi@@ ci@@ ans can be real s@@ no@@ b@@ s about doc@@ tors who are not M@@ .@@ D@@ . &apos; s .
"I &apos;m talking about d@@ enti@@ sts and op@@ tom@@ et@@ ri@@ sts and p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ sts , but maybe es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally anim@@ al doc@@ tors ."
"O@@ f course , most physi@@ ci@@ ans don &apos;t realiz@@ e that it is har@@ der to get into v@@ et school these days than medi@@ cal school , and that when we go to medi@@ cal school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , H@@ om@@ o sa@@ pi@@ ens , but vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans need to learn about health and disease in mam@@ mal@@ s , am@@ ph@@ i@@ bi@@ ans , re@@ pt@@ il@@ es , fish and bir@@ ds ."
So I don &apos;t bl@@ ame the v@@ ets for feel@@ ing an@@ no@@ yed by my profes@@ sion &apos;s con@@ des@@ c@@ en@@ sion and ig@@ no@@ ran@@ ce .
But here &apos;s one from the v@@ ets : What do you call a vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ an who can only take care of one species ?
"A physi@@ ci@@ an . ( Laughter ) C@@ lo@@ sing the ga@@ p has become a pas@@ sion for me , and I &apos;m doing this through progra@@ ms like D@@ ar@@ w@@ in on R@@ oun@@ ds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , where we &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing anim@@ al ex@@ per@@ ts and evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary biologi@@ sts and em@@ bed@@ ding them on our medi@@ cal te@@ am@@ s with our inter@@ ns and our re@@ sid@@ ents ."
"And through Z@@ o@@ ob@@ i@@ qu@@ ity con@@ fer@@ ences , where we bring medi@@ cal scho@@ ols together with vet@@ er@@ in@@ ary scho@@ ols for col@@ labor@@ tive disc@@ us@@ sions of the sha@@ red dise@@ ases and dis@@ or@@ ders of anim@@ al and human patients ."
"A@@ t Z@@ o@@ ob@@ i@@ qu@@ ity con@@ fer@@ ences , parti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts learn how tre@@ ating bre@@ ast cancer in a ti@@ ger can help us better tre@@ at bre@@ ast cancer in a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teach@@ er ; how under@@ standing pol@@ y@@ cy@@ st@@ ic ov@@ eri@@ es in a H@@ ol@@ ste@@ in c@@ ow can help us better take care of a dan@@ ce in@@ struc@@ tor with pain@@ ful peri@@ od@@ s ; and how better under@@ standing the tre@@ at@@ ment of se@@ par@@ ation an@@ x@@ i@@ ety in a high@@ -@@ stru@@ n@@ g Sh@@ el@@ ti@@ e can help an an@@ x@@ i@@ ous young child stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with his first days of school ."
"In the United States and now inter@@ n@@ ation@@ ally , at Z@@ o@@ ob@@ i@@ qu@@ ity con@@ fer@@ ences physi@@ ci@@ ans and vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans ch@@ ec@@ k their at@@ t@@ it@@ ud@@ es and their pre@@ conc@@ ep@@ tions at the do@@ or and come together as colle@@ ag@@ ues , as pe@@ ers , as doc@@ tors ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , we humans are animals , too , and it &apos;s time for us physi@@ ci@@ ans to em@@ bra@@ ce our patients &apos; and our own anim@@ al nat@@ ures and jo@@ in vet@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans in a speci@@ es@@ -@@ sp@@ an@@ ning appro@@ ach to health ."
"Because it turns out , some of the best and most hum@@ ani@@ st@@ ic medi@@ c@@ ine is being pra@@ cti@@ ced by doc@@ tors wh@@ ose patients are@@ n &apos;t human ."
"And one of the best ways we can take care of the human pati@@ ent is by pa@@ ying close atten@@ tion to how all the other patients on the planet live , grow , get si@@ ck and he@@ al ."

C@@ an ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ic information make you heal@@ thy ?
In 200@@ 1 I got h@@ it by a tra@@ in .
My tra@@ in was a heart atta@@ ck .
"I found myself in a hosp@@ ital in an in@@ ten@@ si@@ ve@@ -@@ care ward , rec@@ u@@ per@@ ating from em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy sur@@ ger@@ y ."
And I sud@@ den@@ ly realized something : that I was completely in the dar@@ k .

&quot; C@@ ould my doc@@ tor have war@@ ned me ? &quot;

"G@@ en@@ et@@ ics , li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le and environment ."

And you know why I understand that ?
Because my physi@@ ci@@ ans con@@ stan@@ tly ask me questions about this .

"I mean , if you &apos;re lu@@ ck@@ y enough you get to do it more than once , right ?"
"( Laughter ) Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le and your family history , your medi@@ c@@ ation history , your sur@@ g@@ ical history , your all@@ er@@ gy history ... did I for@@ get any history ?"
"But this part of the equ@@ ation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physi@@ ci@@ ans really get this part of the equ@@ ation ."
"What does that mean , my environment ?"
"Well , it can mean a lot of things ."
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
Wh@@ ile I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you li@@ ved ?
"@@ Ju@@ st think about that , you know , wan@@ der through your life thinking about this ."
And you realiz@@ e that you spend it in a vari@@ ety of different places .
You spend it at re@@ st and you spend it at work .
"And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an air@@ plan@@ e a good por@@ tion of your time trav@@ el@@ ing some place ."
"So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody as@@ ks you , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?"
"And where do you ex@@ pose y@@ ourselves to ri@@ sk@@ s that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the con@@ clu@@ sion that I spend about 7@@ 5 percent of my time rel@@ ati@@ vely in a small number of places ."
"And I don &apos;t wan@@ der far from that place for a maj@@ or@@ ity of my time , even though I &apos;m an ex@@ ten@@ sive global tre@@ k@@ k@@ er ."
"Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little jour@@ ney here ."
"I started off in S@@ c@@ ran@@ ton , P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ani@@ a ."
"I don &apos;t know if any@@ body might ha@@ il from nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ani@@ a , but this is where I sp@@ ent my first 1@@ 9 years with my little young l@@ un@@ gs ."
"You know , bre@@ a@@ thing high con@@ cent@@ r@@ ations here of sul@@ fu@@ r di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de , car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de and me@@ th@@ ane g@@ as , in u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al qu@@ an@@ t@@ ities — 1@@ 9 years of this ."
"And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those p@@ il@@ es of bur@@ ning , sm@@ ol@@ der@@ ing co@@ al w@@ ast@@ e look like ."
"So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid@@ -@@ w@@ est ."
"O@@ K , so I en@@ ded up in L@@ ou@@ is@@ v@@ il@@ le , K@@ ent@@ u@@ ck@@ y ."
"Well , I decided to be ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s to a place called R@@ ub@@ ber@@ to@@ wn ."
They man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture plast@@ ics . They use large qu@@ an@@ t@@ ities ch@@ lo@@ ro@@ pr@@ en@@ e and ben@@ z@@ en@@ e .
"O@@ kay , I sp@@ ent 25 years , in my mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ age l@@ un@@ gs now , bre@@ a@@ thing vari@@ ous con@@ cent@@ r@@ ations of that ."
"And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it ."
It was in@@ si@@ di@@ ous and it was really happening .

And I mo@@ ved to R@@ ed@@ lan@@ ds C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
"V@@ ery ni@@ ce , and there my ol@@ der , s@@ eni@@ or l@@ un@@ gs , as I like to call them , I f@@ ill@@ ed with particul@@ ate matter , car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de and very high do@@ ses of oz@@ one ."
O@@ kay ? Al@@ most like the high@@ est in the n@@ ation .
"A@@ l@@ right , this is what it looks like on a good day ."
"If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about ."
"So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?"
"Well , the picture is , there is a huge ga@@ p here ."
The one thing that never happens in my doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice : They never ask me about my place history .
"No doc@@ tor , can I remember , ever as@@ king me , &quot; Wh@@ ere have you li@@ ved ? &quot;"
They hav@@ en &apos;t asked me what kind of the qu@@ ality of the d@@ rin@@ king water that I put in my m@@ outh or the food that I ing@@ est into my st@@ om@@ ach .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s mis@@ sing .
L@@ o@@ ok at the kind of data that &apos;s av@@ ail@@ able .
This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend bil@@ li@@ ons of dollars invest@@ ing in this kind of research .
"Now , I &apos;ve cir@@ cl@@ ed the places where I &apos;ve been ."
"Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart atta@@ ck I &apos;d been in the right places . R@@ ight ?"
"So , how many people are in the white ?"
How many people in the room have sp@@ ent the maj@@ or@@ ity of their life in the white space ?
A@@ ny@@ body ? Bo@@ y you &apos;re lu@@ ck@@ y .
How many have sp@@ ent it in the red places ?
"O@@ h , not so lu@@ ck@@ y ."
There are thousands of these kinds of ma@@ ps that are dis@@ pla@@ yed in at@@ l@@ ases all over the world .
They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our tra@@ in w@@ rec@@ k .
But no@@ ne of that &apos;s in my medi@@ cal recor@@ d .
And it &apos;s not in y@@ ours ei@@ ther .
"So , here &apos;s my friend P@@ au@@ l ."
"He &apos;s a colle@@ ag@@ ue . He allo@@ wed his cell phone to be tra@@ c@@ ked every two hours , 2@@ 4 / 7 , 3@@ 6@@ 5 days out of the year for the last two years , every@@ where he went ."
And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
And this is where he has sp@@ ent most of his time .
If you really studi@@ ed that you might have some clu@@ es as to what P@@ au@@ l lik@@ es to do .
A@@ ny@@ body got any clu@@ es ? S@@ ki . R@@ ight .
"We can z@@ o@@ om in here , and we sud@@ den@@ ly see that now we see where P@@ au@@ l has really sp@@ ent a maj@@ or@@ ity of his time ."
And all of those black d@@ ots are all of the to@@ x@@ ic re@@ le@@ ase inv@@ ent@@ ories that are mon@@ it@@ o@@ red by the E@@ P@@ A .
D@@ id you know that data exist@@ ed ?
"For every community in the United States , you could have your own person@@ aliz@@ ed ma@@ p of that ."
"So , our cell ph@@ ones can now build a place history ."
This is how P@@ au@@ l did it . He did it with his i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
This might be what we end up with .
This is what the physi@@ ci@@ an would have in front of him and her when we ent@@ er that ex@@ am room instead of just the p@@ in@@ k sli@@ p that said I pa@@ id at the coun@@ ter . R@@ ight ?
This could be my little as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment .
"And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ho@@ a B@@ ill , I su@@ gg@@ est that maybe you not deci@@ de , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , and it &apos;s war@@ m every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck at night ."
"I &apos;d su@@ gg@@ est that that &apos;s a bad idea B@@ ill , because of this re@@ port . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions ."
"O@@ kay , number one is , we must te@@ ach physi@@ ci@@ ans about the val@@ ue of ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ical information ."
It &apos;s called ge@@ om@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ ine . There are about a half a do@@ z@@ en progra@@ ms in the world right now that are foc@@ used on this .
And they &apos;re in the early st@@ ages of develop@@ ment .
"Th@@ ese progra@@ ms need to be sup@@ por@@ ted , and we need to te@@ ach our future doc@@ tors of the world the import@@ ance of some of the information I &apos;ve sha@@ red here with you today ."
"The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding bil@@ li@@ ons and bil@@ li@@ ons of dollars all over the world building an elec@@ tro@@ ni@@ c health recor@@ d , we make sure we put a place history inside that medi@@ cal recor@@ d ."
It not only will be important for the physi@@ ci@@ an ; it will be important for the resear@@ ch@@ ers that now will have huge sam@@ ples to dra@@ w u@@ po@@ n .
But it will also be u@@ se@@ ful for us .
"I could have made the deci@@ sion , if I had this information , not to move to the oz@@ one cap@@ ital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that deci@@ sion ."
O@@ r I could ne@@ got@@ i@@ ate with my em@@ plo@@ y@@ er to make that deci@@ sion in the best inter@@ est of myself and my company .
"W@@ ith that , I would like to just say that J@@ ack L@@ or@@ d said this almost 10 years ago ."
Ju@@ st look at that for a minut@@ e .
"That was what the con@@ clu@@ sion of the D@@ art@@ m@@ outh A@@ t@@ l@@ as of H@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ care was about , was saying that we can expla@@ in the ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ic vari@@ ations that oc@@ cu@@ r in disease , in ill@@ ness , in w@@ ell@@ ness , and how our heal@@ th@@ care system actually oper@@ ates ."
That was what he was talking about on that quot@@ e .
And I would say he got it right almost a de@@ ca@@ de ago .
"So , I &apos;d very much like to see us beg@@ in to really se@@ ize this as an opport@@ unity to get this into our medi@@ cal recor@@ ds ."
"So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : G@@ e@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y always mat@@ ters ."
And I believe that ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ic information can make both you and me very heal@@ thy . Thank you .

"So I was tra@@ ined to become a g@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ st for two years in H@@ u@@ na@@ n , China in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
"When I was in the first gra@@ de , the government wanted to trans@@ f@@ er me to a school for a@@ th@@ let@@ es , all ex@@ pen@@ ses pa@@ id ."
"But my ti@@ ger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engine@@ er like them ."

It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dre@@ am was to become a Ch@@ in@@ ese oper@@ a sin@@ ger .
That is me pla@@ ying my imag@@ in@@ ary pi@@ ano .
"A@@ n oper@@ a sin@@ ger must start tra@@ ining young to learn ac@@ rob@@ ati@@ cs , so I tri@@ ed everything I could to go to oper@@ a school ."
I even w@@ ro@@ te to the school prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al and the ho@@ st of a radi@@ o show .
But no a@@ du@@ l@@ ts li@@ ked the idea .
No a@@ du@@ l@@ ts beli@@ ev@@ ed I was seri@@ ous .
"O@@ n@@ ly my friends sup@@ por@@ ted me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was ."
"So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be tra@@ ined ."
My dre@@ am would never come true .
I was af@@ ra@@ id that for the re@@ st of my life some secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s happ@@ in@@ ess would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so un@@ fa@@ ir .
So I was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to find another call@@ ing .
N@@ ob@@ ody around to te@@ ach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to bo@@ oks .
I s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed my hun@@ ger for par@@ en@@ tal ad@@ vice from this book by a family of writ@@ ers and mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ or@@ respon@@ d@@ ence in the F@@ am@@ ily of F@@ ou Le@@ i &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my ro@@ le model of an inde@@ pen@@ dent woman when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an trad@@ ition re@@ qui@@ res ob@@ e@@ di@@ ence . &#91; &quot; &quot; J@@ ane E@@ y@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be eff@@ ici@@ ent from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er by the D@@ oz@@ en &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was in@@ spi@@ red to study ab@@ ro@@ ad after read@@ ing these .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ om@@ pl@@ ete Wor@@ ks of S@@ an@@ ma@@ o &quot; &quot; ( a@@ ka E@@ ch@@ o Ch@@ an ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ ess@@ ons F@@ rom H@@ ist@@ ory &quot; &quot; by N@@ an H@@ u@@ a@@ i@@ j@@ in &#93; I came to the U.@@ S. in 199@@ 5 , so which bo@@ oks did I read here first ?"
"B@@ o@@ oks ban@@ ned in China , of course ."
&quot; &quot; The Go@@ od Earth &quot; &quot; is about Ch@@ in@@ ese pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not con@@ v@@ eni@@ ent for pro@@ p@@ ag@@ an@@ da . G@@ ot it .
"The Bi@@ ble is interesting , but stran@@ ge ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a to@@ pi@@ c for a different day .
But the fi@@ f@@ th com@@ man@@ d@@ ment gave me an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any : &quot; You sh@@ all ho@@ no@@ r your father and mother . &quot;
"&quot; &quot; H@@ ono@@ r , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than ob@@ ey . &quot; &quot; So it be@@ comes my to@@ ol to clim@@ b out of this Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an gu@@ il@@ t tra@@ p and to re@@ start my relation@@ ship with my parents ."
En@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing a new culture also started my h@@ ab@@ it of com@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing .
It off@@ ers many in@@ si@@ ghts .
"For example , I found this ma@@ p out of place at first because this is what Ch@@ in@@ ese students gre@@ w up with ."
"It had never oc@@ cur@@ red to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the cent@@ er of the world ."
A ma@@ p actually car@@ ri@@ es somebody &apos;s view .
C@@ om@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a stan@@ d@@ ard pra@@ cti@@ ce in the ac@@ a@@ de@@ mic world .
There are even research fiel@@ ds such as com@@ par@@ ative religi@@ on and com@@ par@@ ative liter@@ ature .
C@@ om@@ p@@ are and con@@ tra@@ st gi@@ ves sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s a more compl@@ ete under@@ standing of a to@@ pi@@ c .
"So I thought , well , if com@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing works for research , why not do it in da@@ ily life too ?"
So I started read@@ ing bo@@ oks in pa@@ ir@@ s .
"So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; B@@ en@@ ja@@ m@@ in Fran@@ kl@@ in &quot; &quot; by W@@ al@@ ter I@@ sa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; J@@ oh@@ n A@@ dam@@ s &quot; &quot; by Dav@@ id M@@ c@@ C@@ ul@@ l@@ ough &#93; — who are invol@@ ved in the same ev@@ ent , or friends with sha@@ red experi@@ ences ."

"For the Ch@@ ri@@ st , the tem@@ pt@@ ations are economic , polit@@ ical and sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual ."
"For the B@@ ud@@ d@@ ha , they are all p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical : lu@@ st , fe@@ ar and social du@@ ty — interesting ."
"So if you know a fore@@ ig@@ n language , it &apos;s also fu@@ n to read your fav@@ or@@ ite bo@@ oks in two langu@@ ages ."
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; The W@@ ay of Ch@@ u@@ an@@ g T@@ z@@ u &quot; &quot; Th@@ om@@ as M@@ er@@ ton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Ta@@ o : The W@@ at@@ er@@ course W@@ ay &quot; &quot; Al@@ an W@@ at@@ ts &#93; In@@ st@@ ead of lost in tran@@ sl@@ ation , I found there is much to ga@@ in ."

&quot; &quot; B@@ ri@@ de &quot; &quot; in Ch@@ in@@ ese liter@@ ally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; U@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h .
( Laughter ) Bo@@ oks have given me a ma@@ gic por@@ tal to conne@@ ct with people of the past and the present .
I know I sh@@ all never feel lon@@ ely or power@@ less again .
H@@ av@@ ing a dre@@ am sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed really is nothing com@@ pa@@ red to what many others have su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed .
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only pur@@ pose of a dre@@ am .
"I@@ ts most important pur@@ pose is to get us in tou@@ ch with where dre@@ am@@ s come from , where pas@@ sion comes from , where happ@@ in@@ ess comes from ."
E@@ ven a sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed dre@@ am can do that for you .
"So because of bo@@ oks , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a pur@@ pose and a c@@ lar@@ ity , most of the time ."
So may bo@@ oks be always with you .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"I &apos;m an American , which means , gener@@ ally , I ig@@ no@@ re fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all un@@ less it invol@@ ves guys my size or B@@ ru@@ no &apos;s size ru@@ n@@ ning into each other at ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely high spe@@ ed@@ s ."
"That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ig@@ no@@ re fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all for the last couple of we@@ eks ."
"I go on@@ to T@@ w@@ it@@ ter , there are all these stran@@ ge words that I &apos;ve never heard before : F@@ I@@ F@@ A , v@@ uv@@ u@@ z@@ el@@ a , we@@ ird j@@ ok@@ es about oc@@ to@@ p@@ i ."
"But the one that &apos;s really been sort of st@@ res@@ sing me out , that I hav@@ en &apos;t been able to figure out , is this ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve gone on@@ to T@@ w@@ it@@ ter in the last couple of we@@ eks , you &apos;ve probably seen this ."
It &apos;s been a maj@@ or tr@@ en@@ ding to@@ pi@@ c .
"B@@ eing a mo@@ no@@ lin@@ gu@@ al American , I obvi@@ ously don &apos;t know what the ph@@ ra@@ se means ."
"So I went on@@ to T@@ w@@ it@@ ter , and I asked some people if they could expla@@ in to me &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And for@@ tun@@ ately , my B@@ raz@@ ili@@ an friends were more than ready to help ."
"They expla@@ ined that the G@@ al@@ va@@ o bir@@ d is a ra@@ re and en@@ dan@@ ger@@ ed par@@ ro@@ t that &apos;s in ter@@ ri@@ ble , ter@@ ri@@ ble dan@@ ger ."
"In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it ."
"N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : A word about G@@ al@@ va@@ o , a very ra@@ re kind of bir@@ d n@@ ative to B@@ raz@@ il ."
"E@@ very year , more than 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 G@@ al@@ va@@ o bir@@ ds are kill@@ ed during C@@ ar@@ ni@@ val para@@ des ."
"E@@ than Z@@ u@@ ck@@ er@@ man : O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , this is a tra@@ gic situ@@ ation , and it actually gets wor@@ se ."
"It turns out that , not only is the G@@ al@@ va@@ o par@@ ro@@ t very at@@ tra@@ ctive , u@@ se@@ ful for he@@ add@@ res@@ ses , it evid@@ ently has certain h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ og@@ eni@@ c pro@@ per@@ ti@@ es , which means that there &apos;s a ter@@ ri@@ ble problem with G@@ al@@ va@@ o ab@@ use ."
S@@ ome si@@ ck and tw@@ ist@@ ed people have found themselves s@@ nor@@ ting G@@ al@@ va@@ o .
And it &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ bly en@@ dan@@ ger@@ ed .
"The good news about this is that the global community — again , my B@@ raz@@ ili@@ an friends tell me — is pit@@ ching in to help out ."
"It turns out that L@@ ad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a has re@@ le@@ as@@ ed a new single — actually five or six new sin@@ gl@@ es , as ne@@ ar as I can tell — t@@ it@@ led &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And my B@@ raz@@ ili@@ an friends tell me that if I just t@@ we@@ et the ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o , &quot; &quot; 10 c@@ ents will be given to a global cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to s@@ ave this ra@@ re and beautiful bir@@ d ."
"Now , most of you have fi@@ gu@@ red out that this was a p@@ ran@@ k , and actually a very , very good one ."
"&quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o &quot; &quot; actually means something very different ."
"In P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ ese , it means &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ut your m@@ outh , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And it speci@@ fic@@ ally re@@ f@@ ers to this guy , G@@ al@@ va@@ o B@@ u@@ eno , who &apos;s the le@@ ad so@@ cc@@ er com@@ men@@ tat@@ or for Re@@ de G@@ l@@ ob@@ o ."
And what I understand from my B@@ raz@@ ili@@ an friends is that this guy is just a c@@ lich@@ e machine .
He can ru@@ in the most interesting mat@@ ch by just spo@@ ut@@ ing c@@ lich@@ e again and again and again .
"So B@@ raz@@ ili@@ ans went to that first mat@@ ch against Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , put up this ban@@ ner , started a T@@ w@@ it@@ ter cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n and tri@@ ed to con@@ vin@@ ce the re@@ st of us to t@@ we@@ et the ph@@ ra@@ se : &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so succ@@ ess@@ ful at this that it to@@ pped T@@ w@@ it@@ ter for two we@@ eks ."
Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of l@@ ess@@ ons that you can take from this .
"And the first les@@ son , which I think is a wor@@ th@@ while one , is that you can@@ not go wrong as@@ king people to be ac@@ tive on@@ line , so long as activ@@ ism just means ret@@ we@@ et@@ ing a ph@@ ra@@ se ."
"So as long as activ@@ ism is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with ."
"The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of B@@ raz@@ ili@@ ans on T@@ w@@ it@@ ter ."
There &apos;s more than five million of them .
"As far as national re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation , 11 percent of B@@ raz@@ ili@@ an inter@@ net us@@ ers are on T@@ w@@ it@@ ter ."
That &apos;s a much high@@ er number than in the U.@@ S. or U.@@ K@@ .
"N@@ ex@@ t to J@@ ap@@ an , it &apos;s the second most re@@ pres@@ ented by population ."
"Now if you &apos;re using T@@ w@@ it@@ ter or other social net@@ works , and you didn &apos;t realiz@@ e this was a space with a lot of B@@ raz@@ ili@@ ans in it , you &apos;re like most of us ."
Because what happens on a social net@@ work is you inter@@ act with the people that you have cho@@ se@@ n to inter@@ act with .
"And if you are like me , a big , ge@@ ek@@ y , white , American guy , you t@@ end to inter@@ act with a lot of other ge@@ ek@@ y , white , American guys ."
And you don &apos;t ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily have the sense that T@@ w@@ it@@ ter is in fact a very he@@ av@@ ily B@@ raz@@ ili@@ an space .
"It &apos;s also ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely surpri@@ sing to many Americ@@ ans , a he@@ av@@ ily Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American space ."
T@@ w@@ it@@ ter rec@@ ently did some research .
They looked at their local population .
They believe that 2@@ 4 percent of American T@@ w@@ it@@ ter us@@ ers are Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American .
That &apos;s about tw@@ ice as high as Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Americ@@ ans are re@@ pres@@ ented in the population .
"And again , that was very sho@@ c@@ king to many T@@ w@@ it@@ ter us@@ ers , but it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be ."
And the reason it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into T@@ ren@@ ding T@@ op@@ ics .
And you t@@ end to find to@@ pic@@ s that are almost enti@@ rely Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American con@@ vers@@ ations .
"This was a vis@@ u@@ aliz@@ ation done by F@@ ern@@ an@@ do V@@ i@@ eg@@ as and Mar@@ t@@ in W@@ atten@@ ber@@ g , two amazing vis@@ u@@ aliz@@ ation desig@@ n@@ ers , who looked at a we@@ ek@@ end &apos;s wor@@ th of T@@ w@@ it@@ ter tra@@ f@@ fic and es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally found that a lot of these tr@@ en@@ ding to@@ pic@@ s were basically se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated con@@ vers@@ ations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expe@@ ct ."
"It turns out that oil sp@@ ill is a mo@@ st@@ ly white con@@ vers@@ ation , that co@@ ok@@ out is a mo@@ st@@ ly black con@@ vers@@ ation ."
"And what &apos;s c@@ raz@@ y about this is that if you wanted to mi@@ x up who you were seeing on T@@ w@@ it@@ ter , it &apos;s liter@@ ally a qu@@ ick c@@ li@@ ck away ."
"You c@@ li@@ ck on that co@@ ok@@ out ta@@ g , there an enti@@ rely different con@@ vers@@ ation with different people parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating in it ."
"But gener@@ ally spe@@ a@@ king , most of us don &apos;t ."
"We end up within these fil@@ ter bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es , as my friend E@@ li Par@@ is@@ er call@@ s them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are si@@ mil@@ ar to the people we already know ."
And we t@@ end not to see that w@@ id@@ er picture .
"Now for me , I &apos;m surpri@@ sed by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the inter@@ net was sup@@ posed to be ."
"If you go back into the early days of the inter@@ net , when cy@@ ber@@ -@@ u@@ to@@ pi@@ ans like N@@ ick Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te were writ@@ ing big bo@@ oks like &quot; &quot; B@@ eing D@@ ig@@ ital , &quot; &quot; the predi@@ ction was that the inter@@ net was going to be an incredi@@ bly powerful for@@ ce to s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h out cul@@ tu@@ ral differ@@ ences , to put us all on a common fiel@@ d of one fa@@ shi@@ on or another ."
Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te started his book with a story about how hard it is to build conne@@ ctions in the world of atom@@ s .
He &apos;s at a technology con@@ fer@@ ence in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da .
"And he &apos;s looking at something really , tru@@ ly ab@@ sur@@ d , which is bot@@ t@@ les of E@@ vi@@ an water on the table ."
And Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te says this is c@@ raz@@ y .
This is the old economy .
"It &apos;s the economy of moving these he@@ av@@ y , s@@ low atom@@ s over long di@@ stan@@ ces that &apos;s very difficult to do ."
"We &apos;re he@@ ad@@ ing to the future of b@@ its , where everything is spe@@ ed@@ y , it &apos;s we@@ igh@@ t@@ less ."
It can be any@@ where in the world at any time .
And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
"Now , Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te has been right about a lot of things ."
He &apos;s tot@@ ally wrong about this one .
It turns out that in many c@@ ases atom@@ s are much more mobil@@ e than b@@ its .
"If I walk into a st@@ ore in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to bu@@ y water that &apos;s bot@@ t@@ led in F@@ i@@ j@@ i , shi@@ pped at great ex@@ pen@@ se to the United States ."
It &apos;s actually surpri@@ sing@@ ly hard for me to see a F@@ i@@ j@@ i@@ an fe@@ ature fil@@ m .
It &apos;s really difficult for me to list@@ en to F@@ i@@ j@@ i@@ an music .
"It &apos;s ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely difficult for me to get F@@ i@@ j@@ i@@ an news , which is stran@@ ge , because actually there &apos;s an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount going on in F@@ i@@ j@@ i ."
There &apos;s a cou@@ p government . There &apos;s a mil@@ it@@ ary government .
There &apos;s cra@@ ck@@ do@@ w@@ ns on the pres@@ s .
It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be pa@@ ying atten@@ tion to at the moment .
Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
I think that we t@@ end to look a lot at the infra@@ structure of glob@@ aliz@@ ation .
We look at the fra@@ me@@ work that makes it possible to live in this conne@@ cted world .
And that &apos;s a fra@@ me@@ work that inclu@@ des things like air@@ line ro@@ ut@@ es .
It inclu@@ des things like the Internet c@@ ab@@ les .
"We look at a ma@@ p like this one , and it looks like the entire world is fl@@ at because everything is a ho@@ p or two away ."
"You can get on a f@@ light in Lon@@ don , you can end up in B@@ ang@@ al@@ ore later today ."
"T@@ w@@ o ho@@ ps , you &apos;re in Su@@ va , the cap@@ it@@ ol of F@@ i@@ j@@ i ."
It &apos;s all right there .
"When you start looking at what actually flo@@ ws on top of these net@@ works , you get a very different picture ."
"You start looking at how the global plan@@ e f@@ li@@ ghts move , and you sud@@ den@@ ly disc@@ over that the world isn &apos;t even close to fl@@ at ."
It &apos;s ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely l@@ um@@ py .
"There are parts of the world that are very , very well conne@@ cted ."
There &apos;s basically a gi@@ ant pa@@ th@@ way in the sk@@ y between Lon@@ don and New York .
"@@ but look at this ma@@ p , and you can wat@@ ch this for , you know , two or three minutes ."
You won &apos;t see very many plan@@ es go from S@@ outh America to Africa .
And you &apos;ll disc@@ over that there are parts of the glob@@ e that are syst@@ emati@@ cally c@@ ut off .
"When we stop looking at the infra@@ structure that makes conne@@ ction possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realiz@@ ing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does ."
So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interest@@ ed in in the last de@@ ca@@ de or so .
"The world is , in fact , getting more global ."
It &apos;s getting more conne@@ cted .
M@@ ore of problems are global in scale .
M@@ ore of our econo@@ m@@ ics is global in scale .
And our medi@@ a is less global by the day .
"If you wat@@ ched a tele@@ vision bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast in the United States in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , 3@@ 5 to 40 percent of it would have been inter@@ national news on a ni@@ gh@@ tly new bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast ."
That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
And this ten@@ ds to give us a very dist@@ or@@ ted view of the world .
Here &apos;s a sli@@ de that A@@ li@@ sa M@@ ill@@ er sho@@ wed at a pre@@ vi@@ ous TED T@@ al@@ k .
A@@ li@@ sa &apos;s the pre@@ sid@@ ent of P@@ u@@ bli@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o Inter@@ national .
"And she made a car@@ to@@ gra@@ m , which is basically a dist@@ or@@ ted ma@@ p based on what American tele@@ vision news c@@ ast@@ s looked at for a mon@@ th ."
"And you see that when you dist@@ or@@ t a ma@@ p based on atten@@ tion , the world within American tele@@ vision news is basically re@@ duc@@ ed to this gi@@ ant blo@@ ated U.@@ S@@ ."
and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve in@@ va@@ ded .
And that &apos;s basically what our medi@@ a is about .
"And before you con@@ clu@@ de that this is just a fun@@ ction of American T@@ V news — which is dre@@ ad@@ ful , and I ag@@ ree that it &apos;s dre@@ ad@@ ful — I &apos;ve been ma@@ pp@@ ing el@@ ite medi@@ a like the New York T@@ imes , and I get the same thing ."
"When you look at the New York T@@ imes , you look at other el@@ ite medi@@ a , what you lar@@ g@@ ely get are pic@@ tures of very we@@ al@@ thy n@@ ations and the n@@ ations we &apos;ve in@@ va@@ ded ."
It turns out that new medi@@ a isn &apos;t ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily hel@@ ping us all that much .
Here &apos;s a ma@@ p made by Mar@@ k G@@ ra@@ ha@@ m who &apos;s down the stre@@ et at the O@@ x@@ for@@ d Internet In@@ st@@ it@@ ute .
A this is a ma@@ p of arti@@ cl@@ es in W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a that have been ge@@ o-@@ c@@ od@@ ed .
And you &apos;ll not@@ ice that there &apos;s a very he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ wards Nor@@ th America and W@@ ester@@ n Euro@@ pe .
"E@@ ven within W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ as , where we &apos;re cre@@ ating their own con@@ t@@ ent on@@ line , there &apos;s a he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ wards the place where a lot of the W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a au@@ th@@ ors are based , rather than to the re@@ st of the world ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , you can get up , you can pic@@ k up your computer when you get out of this s@@ es@@ sion , you could read a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er from India or from A@@ u@@ str@@ ali@@ a , from C@@ an@@ a@@ da , G@@ od for@@ bi@@ d from the U.@@ S@@ ."
You probably won &apos;t .
"If you look at on@@ line medi@@ a con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion — in this case , in the top 10 us@@ ers of the inter@@ net — more than 9@@ 5 percent of the news re@@ a@@ der@@ ship is on dom@@ est@@ ic news sit@@ es ."
"It &apos;s one of these ra@@ re c@@ ases where the U.@@ S. is actually sli@@ gh@@ tly better than &#91; the U.@@ K@@ . &#93; , because we actually like read@@ ing your medi@@ a , rather than vice ver@@ sa ."
So all of this star@@ ts le@@ ad@@ ing me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I re@@ f@@ er to as imag@@ in@@ ary c@@ os@@ mo@@ polit@@ an@@ ism .
We look at the inter@@ net .
We think we &apos;re getting this wi@@ de view of the glob@@ e .
"We oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally stu@@ m@@ ble on@@ to a p@@ age in Ch@@ in@@ ese , and we deci@@ de that we do in fact have the gre@@ at@@ est technology ever built to conne@@ ct us to the re@@ st of the world ."
And we for@@ get that most of the time we &apos;re ch@@ ec@@ king B@@ ost@@ on R@@ ed So@@ x s@@ co@@ res .
"So this is a real problem — not just because the R@@ ed So@@ x are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re disc@@ us@@ sing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to sol@@ ve are global in scale and sc@@ op@@ e , they re@@ qui@@ re global con@@ vers@@ ations to get to global sol@@ utions ."
This is a problem we have to sol@@ ve .
So here &apos;s the good news .
"For six years , I &apos;ve been han@@ ging out with these guys ."
This is a group called G@@ l@@ ob@@ al Vo@@ ices .
This is a team of blo@@ gg@@ ers from around the world .
O@@ ur mis@@ sion was to fi@@ x the world &apos;s medi@@ a .
We started in 200@@ 4 .
"You might have not@@ ic@@ ed , we hav@@ en &apos;t done all that well so far ."
"N@@ or do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to sol@@ ve the problem ."
"But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting l@@ ess@@ ons for how we would re@@ wi@@ re if we we wanted to use the we@@ b to have a w@@ id@@ er world ."
The first thing you have to consi@@ der is that there are parts of the world that are dar@@ k spo@@ ts in terms of atten@@ tion .
In this case — the ma@@ p of the world at night by N@@ A@@ S@@ A — they &apos;re dar@@ k liter@@ ally because of l@@ ack of electri@@ city .
And I used to think that a dar@@ k spo@@ t on this ma@@ p basically me@@ ant you &apos;re not going to get medi@@ a from there because there are more ba@@ sic needs .
"What I &apos;m star@@ ting to realiz@@ e is that you can get medi@@ a , it &apos;s just an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of work , and you need an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ment ."
"One of those dar@@ k spo@@ ts is Ma@@ da@@ g@@ as@@ car , a country which is gener@@ ally better known for the D@@ re@@ am@@ works fil@@ m than it is actually known for the lov@@ ely people who live there ."
And so the people who f@@ oun@@ ded F@@ o@@ ko C@@ lu@@ b in Ma@@ da@@ g@@ as@@ car wer@@ en &apos;t actually con@@ cer@@ ned with trying to change the image of their country .
They were doing something much sim@@ pl@@ er .
It was a clu@@ b to learn En@@ gli@@ sh and to learn compu@@ ters and the inter@@ net .
but what happened was that Ma@@ da@@ g@@ as@@ car went through a viol@@ ent cou@@ p .
Mo@@ st inde@@ pen@@ dent medi@@ a was sh@@ ut down .
"And the high school students who were learning to blo@@ g through F@@ o@@ ko C@@ lu@@ b sud@@ den@@ ly found themselves talking to an inter@@ national audi@@ ence about the demon@@ str@@ ations , the viol@@ ence , everything that was going on within this country ."
"So a very , very small progra@@ m desig@@ ned to get people in front of compu@@ ters , publi@@ sh@@ ing their own thou@@ ghts , publi@@ sh@@ ing inde@@ pen@@ dent medi@@ a , en@@ ded up having a huge imp@@ act on what we know about this country ."
Now the tri@@ ck with this is that I &apos;m gu@@ ess@@ ing most people here don &apos;t speak M@@ al@@ ag@@ as@@ y .
"I &apos;m also gu@@ ess@@ ing that most of you don &apos;t even speak Ch@@ in@@ ese — which is sort of sa@@ d if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most re@@ pres@@ ented language on the inter@@ net ."
F@@ or@@ tun@@ ately people are trying to figure out how to fi@@ x this .
"If you &apos;re using Google Ch@@ ro@@ me and you go to a Ch@@ in@@ ese language s@@ ite , you not@@ ice this really c@@ ute bo@@ x at the top , which au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally det@@ ec@@ ts that the p@@ age is in Ch@@ in@@ ese and very quickly at a m@@ ou@@ se c@@ li@@ ck will give you a tran@@ sl@@ ation of the p@@ age ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it &apos;s a machine tran@@ sl@@ ation of the p@@ age ."
"And while Google is very , very good with some langu@@ ages , it &apos;s actually pretty dre@@ ad@@ ful with Ch@@ in@@ ese ."
And the resul@@ ts can be pretty fun@@ ny .
"What you really want — what I really want , is ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally the ability to pus@@ h a bu@@ t@@ ton and have this qu@@ e@@ u@@ ed so a human being can tran@@ sl@@ ate this ."
"And if you think this is ab@@ sur@@ d , it &apos;s not ."
There &apos;s a group right now in China called Ye@@ e@@ y@@ an .
"And Ye@@ e@@ y@@ an is a group of 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers who get on@@ line every day ."
They look for the most interesting con@@ t@@ ent in the En@@ gli@@ sh language .
"They tran@@ sl@@ ate rou@@ gh@@ ly 100 arti@@ cl@@ es a day from maj@@ or ne@@ w@@ spa@@ per@@ s , maj@@ or we@@ b@@ sit@@ es ."
They put it on@@ line for free .
"It &apos;s the project of a guy na@@ med Z@@ han@@ g Le@@ i , who was living in the United States during the L@@ h@@ as@@ a ri@@ ots and who couldn &apos;t believe how bi@@ as@@ ed American medi@@ a c@@ over@@ age was ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start tran@@ sl@@ ating , so that people between these countries start under@@ standing each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Ye@@ e@@ y@@ an can line up 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 people to tran@@ sl@@ ate the En@@ gli@@ sh inter@@ net into Ch@@ in@@ ese , where &apos;s the En@@ gli@@ sh language Ye@@ e@@ y@@ an ?"
"Wh@@ o &apos;s going after Ch@@ in@@ ese , which now has 4@@ 00 million inter@@ net us@@ ers out there ?"
My gu@@ ess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
"So even if we can find a way to tran@@ sl@@ ate from Ch@@ in@@ ese , there &apos;s no gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e that we &apos;re going to find it ."
"When we look for information on@@ line , we basically have two strate@@ gi@@ es ."
We use a lot of sear@@ ch .
And sear@@ ch is ter@@ ri@@ fic if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
"But if what you &apos;re looking for is ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity , if you want to stu@@ m@@ ble on@@ to something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our ma@@ in ph@@ il@@ oso@@ ph@@ y is to look to our social net@@ works , to look for our friends ."
What are they looking at ? Ma@@ ybe we should be looking at it .
The problem with this is that es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally what you end up getting after a while is the w@@ is@@ dom of the flo@@ ck .
"You end up flo@@ c@@ king with a lot of people who are probably si@@ mil@@ ar to you , who have si@@ mil@@ ar interest@@ s ."
"And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other flo@@ cks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interest@@ s ."
"To do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bu@@ m@@ p you out of your flo@@ ck and into another flo@@ ck ."
You need a gu@@ i@@ de .
So this is A@@ mi@@ ra A@@ l H@@ us@@ sa@@ in@@ i . She is the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ed@@ it@@ or for G@@ l@@ ob@@ al Vo@@ ices .
She has one of the har@@ d@@ est j@@ ob@@ s in the world .
"N@@ ot only does she have to keep our I@@ s@@ ra@@ eli and P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ i@@ an con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tors from kill@@ ing each other , she has to figure out what is going to inter@@ est you about the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ."
"And in that sense of trying to get you out of your norm@@ al or@@ bit , and to try to get you to p@@ ay atten@@ tion to a story about someone who &apos;s given up s@@ mo@@ king for the mon@@ th of R@@ am@@ ad@@ an , she has to know something about a global audi@@ ence ."
She has to know something about what stories are av@@ ail@@ able .
"B@@ a@@ sically , she &apos;s a de@@ e@@ ja@@ y ."
"S@@ he &apos;s a sk@@ ill@@ ed human cur@@ ator who kno@@ ws what material is av@@ ail@@ able to her , who &apos;s able to list@@ en to the audi@@ ence , and who &apos;s able to make a sel@@ ec@@ tion and pus@@ h people for@@ ward in one fa@@ shi@@ on or another ."
I don &apos;t think this is ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mic process .
I think what &apos;s great about the inter@@ net is that it actually makes it much e@@ a@@ si@@ er for de@@ e@@ ja@@ ys to re@@ ach a w@@ id@@ er audi@@ ence .
I know A@@ mi@@ ra .
I can ask her what to read .
"But with the inter@@ net , she &apos;s in a pos@@ ition where she can tell a lot of people what to read ."
"And you can list@@ en to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interest@@ ed in having your we@@ b w@@ id@@ en@@ ed ."
"So once you start w@@ id@@ ening like this , once you start li@@ gh@@ ting up vo@@ ices in the dar@@ k spo@@ ts , once you start tran@@ sl@@ ating , once you start cur@@ ating , you end up in some really we@@ ird places ."
"This is an image from pretty much my fav@@ or@@ ite blo@@ g , which is Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get ."
And Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get is a blo@@ g that looks at technology in an Africa con@@ text .
"And speci@@ fic@@ ally , it &apos;s looking at a bl@@ ac@@ k@@ sm@@ ith in K@@ i@@ ber@@ a in Na@@ i@@ rob@@ i , who is tur@@ ning the sh@@ af@@ t of a L@@ an@@ d@@ rov@@ er into a c@@ old chi@@ se@@ l ."
"And when you look at this image , you might find y@@ ourself going , &quot; Why would I conc@@ ei@@ v@@ ably care about this ? &quot;"
"And the tru@@ th is , this guy can probably expla@@ in this to you ."
This is E@@ ri@@ k H@@ er@@ sm@@ an . You guys may have seen him around the con@@ fer@@ ence .
He goes by the mon@@ ik@@ er Wh@@ ite Afri@@ can .
"He &apos;s both a very well known American ge@@ ek , but he &apos;s also K@@ en@@ y@@ an ; he was born in S@@ ud@@ an , gre@@ w up in K@@ en@@ y@@ a ."
He is a bri@@ d@@ ge figure .
"He is someone who liter@@ ally has fe@@ et in both wor@@ l@@ ds — one in the world of the Afri@@ can technology community , one in the world of the American technology community ."
"And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this bl@@ ac@@ k@@ sm@@ ith in K@@ i@@ ber@@ a and turn it into a story about re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ing technology , about innov@@ ating from con@@ stra@@ in@@ t , about looking for in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation based on re@@ using materi@@ als ."
"He kno@@ ws one world , and he &apos;s fin@@ ding a way to communic@@ ate it to another world , both of which he has de@@ ep conne@@ ctions to ."
"Th@@ ese bri@@ d@@ ge fi@@ gu@@ res , I &apos;m pretty well con@@ vin@@ ced , are the future of how we try to make the world w@@ id@@ er through using the we@@ b ."
"But the tri@@ ck with bri@@ d@@ ges is , ul@@ tim@@ ately , you need someone to c@@ ross them ."
And that &apos;s where we start talking about x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ es .
"So if I found myself in the N@@ F@@ L , I su@@ spe@@ ct I would spend my off@@ -@@ se@@ as@@ on n@@ ur@@ sing my w@@ oun@@ ds , en@@ jo@@ ying my house , so on and so for@@ th — pos@@ si@@ bly recor@@ ding a hi@@ p@@ -@@ ho@@ p al@@ bu@@ m ."
"D@@ han@@ i J@@ ones , who is the middle lin@@ e@@ back@@ er for the C@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ nat@@ i B@@ eng@@ als , has a sli@@ gh@@ tly different appro@@ ach to the off@@ -@@ se@@ as@@ on ."
D@@ han@@ i has a tele@@ vision show .
"It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; D@@ han@@ i T@@ ac@@ kl@@ es the G@@ l@@ ob@@ e . &quot; &quot; And every week on this tele@@ vision show , D@@ han@@ i trav@@ els to a different n@@ ation of the world ."
He fin@@ ds a local s@@ por@@ ting team .
"He tra@@ ins with them for a week , and he pla@@ ys a mat@@ ch with them ."
And his reason for this is not just that he wan@@ ts to ma@@ ster Mu@@ ay Th@@ a@@ i bo@@ x@@ ing .
"It &apos;s because , for him , s@@ port is the language that allo@@ ws him to en@@ coun@@ ter the full w@@ id@@ th and won@@ der of the world ."
F@@ or some of us it might be music . F@@ or some of us it might be food .
F@@ or a lot of us it might be liter@@ ature or writ@@ ing .
But there are all these different tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that al@@ low you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
The go@@ al of my T@@ al@@ k here is not to per@@ su@@ a@@ de the people in this room to em@@ bra@@ ce your x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ ili@@ a .
"My gu@@ ess — given that you &apos;re at a con@@ fer@@ ence called TE@@ D@@ G@@ l@@ ob@@ al — is that most of you are x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ es , whether or not you use that ter@@ m ."
My chall@@ enge instead is this .
It &apos;s not enough to make the pers@@ onal deci@@ sion that you want a w@@ id@@ er world .
We have to figure out how to re@@ wi@@ re the systems that we have .
We have to fi@@ x our medi@@ a .
We have to fi@@ x the inter@@ net . We have to fi@@ x our education .
We have to fi@@ x our im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation po@@ lic@@ y .
"We need to look at ways of cre@@ ating ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity , of making tran@@ sl@@ ation per@@ va@@ sive , and we need to find ways to em@@ bra@@ ce and c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate these bri@@ d@@ ge fi@@ gu@@ res ."
And we need to figure out how to cul@@ tiv@@ ate x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ es .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
( Applause )
"B@@ a@@ sically , there &apos;s a maj@@ or de@@ mog@@ ra@@ ph@@ ic ev@@ ent going on ."
And it may be that pas@@ sing the 50 percent ur@@ b@@ an point is an economic ti@@ pp@@ ing point . So the world now is a ma@@ p of conne@@ c@@ tiv@@ ity .
It used to be that Par@@ is and Lon@@ don and New York were the lar@@ g@@ est cities .
What we have now is the end of the ri@@ se of the W@@ est . That &apos;s over .
The ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate num@@ bers are over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
"So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , v@@ ill@@ ages of the world are em@@ pt@@ ying out ."
"The question is , why ?"
"And here &apos;s the un@@ ro@@ man@@ ti@@ c tru@@ th — and the city air makes you free , they said in R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance Ger@@ many . So some people go to places like Sh@@ an@@ gh@@ a@@ i but most go to the squ@@ at@@ ter cities where a@@ es@@ th@@ et@@ ics ru@@ le ."
And these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed by pover@@ ty .
They &apos;re people getting out of pover@@ ty as f@@ ast as they can .
"They &apos;re the dom@@ in@@ ant buil@@ ders and to a large ex@@ t@@ ent , the dom@@ in@@ ant desig@@ n@@ ers ."
They have hom@@ e-@@ bre@@ wed infra@@ structure and vi@@ b@@ ran@@ t ur@@ b@@ an life .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ si@@ x@@ th of the G@@ D@@ P in India is coming out of M@@ um@@ ba@@ i .
"They are con@@ stan@@ tly up@@ gra@@ ding , and in a few c@@ ases , the government hel@@ ps ."
E@@ duc@@ ation is the ma@@ in ev@@ ent that can happen in cities .
What &apos;s going on in the stre@@ et in M@@ um@@ ba@@ i ?
A@@ l G@@ ore kno@@ ws . It &apos;s basically everything .
There &apos;s no u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment in squ@@ at@@ ter cities . E@@ ver@@ y@@ one works .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ si@@ x@@ th of hum@@ an@@ ity is there . It &apos;s so@@ on going to be more than that .
So here &apos;s the first p@@ un@@ ch line : cities have def@@ used the population b@@ om@@ b .
And here &apos;s the second p@@ un@@ ch line .
That &apos;s the news from do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn . Here it is in perspe@@ ctive .
S@@ tar@@ s have sh@@ ined down on ear@@ th &apos;s life for bil@@ li@@ ons of years .
Now we &apos;re sh@@ ining right back up .
Thank you .
"The night before I was he@@ ad@@ ing for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land , I was inv@@ ited to ho@@ st the fin@@ al of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s G@@ ot T@@ al@@ ent &quot; &quot; show in Sh@@ an@@ gh@@ a@@ i with the 8@@ 0,000 live audi@@ ence in the sta@@ di@@ um ."
G@@ u@@ ess who was the per@@ form@@ ing gu@@ est ?
S@@ us@@ an Bo@@ y@@ le .
"And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to S@@ c@@ ot@@ land the next day . &quot; &quot; She san@@ g beauti@@ fully , and she even manag@@ ed to say a few words in Ch@@ in@@ ese : 送@@ 你@@ 葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; h@@ ell@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; th@@ ank you , &quot; &quot; that ordin@@ ary stuff ."
It means &quot; &quot; gre@@ en on@@ ion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
"Because it was a line from our Ch@@ in@@ ese par@@ al@@ le@@ l S@@ us@@ an Bo@@ y@@ le — a 5@@ 0-@@ some year@@ -@@ old woman , a ve@@ get@@ able ven@@ d@@ or in Sh@@ an@@ gh@@ a@@ i , who lov@@ es sing@@ ing W@@ ester@@ n oper@@ a , but she didn &apos;t understand any En@@ gli@@ sh or F@@ ren@@ ch or I@@ tal@@ i@@ an , so she manag@@ ed to f@@ ill in the ly@@ ri@@ cs with ve@@ get@@ able na@@ m@@ es in Ch@@ in@@ ese ."
"( Laughter ) And the last sent@@ ence of N@@ es@@ su@@ n D@@ or@@ ma that she was sing@@ ing in the sta@@ di@@ um was &quot; &quot; gre@@ en on@@ ion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; S@@ us@@ an Bo@@ y@@ le was saying that , 8@@ 0,000 live audi@@ ence san@@ g together ."
That was h@@ il@@ ari@@ ous .
So I gu@@ ess both S@@ us@@ an Bo@@ y@@ le and this ve@@ get@@ able ven@@ d@@ or in Sh@@ an@@ gh@@ a@@ i bel@@ on@@ g@@ ed to o@@ th@@ ern@@ ess .
"They were the least expe@@ cted to be succ@@ ess@@ ful in the business called en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , yet their cou@@ ra@@ ge and tal@@ ent b@@ rou@@ ght them through ."
And a show and a plat@@ form gave them the stage to realiz@@ e their dre@@ am@@ s .
"Well , being different is not that difficult ."
We are all different from different perspe@@ cti@@ ves .
"But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view ."
You may have the chan@@ ce to make a difference .
"My gener@@ ation has been very for@@ tun@@ ate to w@@ it@@ ness and parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in the h@@ istori@@ c trans@@ form@@ ation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years ."
"I remember that in the year of 199@@ 0 , when I was gradu@@ ating from colle@@ ge , I was ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job in the s@@ al@@ es de@@ part@@ ment of the first fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar hotel in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , Gre@@ at W@@ all Sh@@ er@@ at@@ on — it &apos;s still there ."
"So after being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated by this J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese manag@@ er for a half an h@@ our , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , M@@ is@@ s Y@@ an@@ g , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I sum@@ mon@@ ed my cou@@ ra@@ ge and po@@ ise and said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , but could you let me know , what actually do you s@@ ell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a clu@@ e what a s@@ al@@ es de@@ part@@ ment was about in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar hotel ."
That was the first day I set my fo@@ ot in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar hotel .
"A@@ round the same time , I was going through an au@@ d@@ ition — the first ever open au@@ d@@ ition by national tele@@ vision in China — with another thou@@ s@@ and colle@@ ge gir@@ ls ."
"The produc@@ er told us they were looking for some s@@ we@@ et , in@@ no@@ c@@ ent and beautiful f@@ res@@ h face ."
"So when it was my turn , I sto@@ od up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s person@@ al@@ ities on tele@@ vision always have to be beautiful , s@@ we@@ et , in@@ no@@ c@@ ent and , you know , sup@@ por@@ tive ?"
Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own vo@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of off@@ en@@ ded them .
"But actually , they were im@@ pres@@ sed by my words ."
"And so I was in the second round of comp@@ et@@ ition , and then the third and the f@@ our@@ th ."
"A@@ f@@ ter se@@ ven ro@@ un@@ ds of comp@@ et@@ ition , I was the last one to survi@@ ve it ."
So I was on a national tele@@ vision pri@@ me@@ -@@ time show .
"And believe it or not , that was the first show on Ch@@ in@@ ese tele@@ vision that allo@@ wed its ho@@ sts to speak out of their own min@@ ds without read@@ ing an appro@@ ved sc@@ ri@@ pt ."
( Applause ) And my we@@ ek@@ ly audi@@ ence at that time was between 2@@ 00 to 3@@ 00 million people .
"Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.@@ S. and C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a Uni@@ vers@@ ity to pur@@ su@@ e my post@@ gradu@@ ate studi@@ es , and then started my own medi@@ a company , which was un@@ thought of during the years that I started my care@@ er ."
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve inter@@ vi@@ e@@ wed more than a thou@@ s@@ and people in the past .
"And sometimes I have young people appro@@ ach@@ ing me say , &quot; &quot; L@@ an , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel pro@@ u@@ d of that ."
But then we are also so for@@ tun@@ ate to w@@ it@@ ness the trans@@ form@@ ation of the whole country .
I was in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing &apos;s bi@@ d@@ ding for the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c G@@ am@@ es .
I was re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing the Sh@@ an@@ gh@@ a@@ i E@@ x@@ po .
I saw China em@@ bra@@ cing the world and vice ver@@ sa .
"But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young gener@@ ation up to ?"
"H@@ ow are they different , and what are the differ@@ ences they are going to make to sh@@ ape the future of China , or at large , the world ?"
So today I want to talk about young people through the plat@@ form of social medi@@ a .
"F@@ i@@ rst of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?"
"Well this is a girl called G@@ u@@ o M@@ e@@ ime@@ i — 20 years old , beautiful ."
"S@@ he sho@@ wed off her ex@@ pen@@ sive b@@ ag@@ s , clo@@ th@@ es and car on her micro@@ blo@@ g , which is the Ch@@ in@@ ese ver@@ sion of T@@ w@@ it@@ ter ."
And she c@@ la@@ im@@ ed to be the gener@@ al manag@@ er of R@@ ed C@@ ross at the Ch@@ am@@ ber of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce .
"S@@ he didn &apos;t realiz@@ e that she ste@@ pped on a sen@@ s@@ itive ner@@ ve and a@@ ro@@ used national questi@@ on@@ ing , almost a tur@@ mo@@ il , against the cre@@ di@@ bil@@ ity of R@@ ed C@@ ross ."
"The contro@@ ver@@ sy was so he@@ ated that the R@@ ed C@@ ross had to open a pres@@ s con@@ fer@@ ence to cl@@ ari@@ fy it , and the invest@@ ig@@ ation is going on ."
"So far , as of today , we know that she her@@ self made up that t@@ it@@ le — probably because she feel@@ s pro@@ u@@ d to be as@@ soci@@ ated with ch@@ ar@@ ity ."
"A@@ ll those ex@@ pen@@ sive it@@ ems were given to her as gi@@ f@@ ts by her bo@@ y@@ friend , who used to be a bo@@ ard mem@@ ber in a sub@@ di@@ vision of R@@ ed C@@ ross at Ch@@ am@@ ber of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce ."
It &apos;s very comp@@ lic@@ ated to expla@@ in .
"But any@@ way , the public still doesn &apos;t bu@@ y it ."
It is still bo@@ il@@ ing .
"It shows us a gener@@ al mi@@ stru@@ st of government or govern@@ men@@ t-@@ bac@@ ked instit@@ utions , which l@@ ac@@ ked tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy in the past ."
And also it sho@@ wed us the power and the imp@@ act of social medi@@ a as micro@@ blo@@ g .
"M@@ ic@@ ro@@ blo@@ g bo@@ om@@ ed in the year of 20@@ 10 , with vis@@ it@@ ors d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed and time sp@@ ent on it tri@@ pl@@ ed ."
"S@@ in@@ a@@ .@@ c@@ om , a maj@@ or news por@@ tal , alone has more than 1@@ 40 million micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ers ."
"On T@@ en@@ c@@ ent , 2@@ 00 million ."
"The most popul@@ ar blo@@ g@@ ger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a mo@@ vie st@@ ar , and she has more than 9@@ .@@ 5 million fol@@ lo@@ wers , or f@@ ans ."
"A@@ b@@ out 80 percent of those micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ers are young people , under 30 years old ."
"And because , as you know , the trad@@ iti@@ onal medi@@ a is still he@@ av@@ ily contro@@ l@@ led by the government , social medi@@ a off@@ ers an op@@ ening to let the ste@@ am out a little bit ."
"But because you don &apos;t have many other op@@ en@@ ings , the he@@ at coming out of this op@@ ening is sometimes very stron@@ g , ac@@ tive and even viol@@ ent ."
"So through micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ing , we are able to understand Ch@@ in@@ ese y@@ outh even better ."
So how are they different ?
"F@@ i@@ rst of all , most of them were born in the 8@@ 0s and 9@@ 0s , under the on@@ e-@@ child po@@ lic@@ y ."
"And because of sel@@ ec@@ ted ab@@ or@@ tion by famili@@ es who fav@@ o@@ red bo@@ ys to gir@@ ls , now we have en@@ ded up with 30 million more young men than women ."
"That could pose a pot@@ ential dan@@ ger to the society , but who kno@@ ws ; we &apos;re in a glob@@ aliz@@ ed world , so they can look for gir@@ l@@ friends from other countries ."
Mo@@ st of them have fa@@ ir@@ ly good education .
The il@@ liter@@ ac@@ y rate in China am@@ ong this gener@@ ation is under one percent .
"In cities , 80 percent of kids go to colle@@ ge ."
"But they are fac@@ ing an ag@@ ing China with a population ab@@ ov@@ e 6@@ 5 years old coming up with se@@ ven@@ -@@ poin@@ t-@@ some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 20@@ 30 ."
"And you know we have the trad@@ ition that youn@@ ger gener@@ ations sup@@ port the el@@ ders finan@@ ci@@ ally , and taking care of them when they &apos;re si@@ ck ."
So it means young cou@@ ples will have to sup@@ port four parents who have a life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy of 7@@ 3 years old .
So making a living is not that easy for young people .
C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge gradu@@ ates are not in shor@@ t sup@@ ply .
"In ur@@ b@@ an are@@ as , colle@@ ge gradu@@ ates find the star@@ ting s@@ al@@ ary is about 4@@ 00 U.@@ S. dollars a mon@@ th , while the aver@@ age r@@ ent is ab@@ ov@@ e $ 500 ."
"So what do they do ? They have to share space — squ@@ e@@ ez@@ ed in very lim@@ ited space to s@@ ave money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tri@@ be of an@@ ts . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get mar@@ ri@@ ed and bu@@ y their a@@ part@@ ment , they fi@@ gu@@ red out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to af@@ for@@ d their first a@@ part@@ ment ."
"That r@@ ati@@ o in America would only cost a couple five years to ear@@ n , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the sk@@ y@@ ro@@ ck@@ et@@ ing real est@@ ate pri@@ ce ."
"A@@ mon@@ g the 2@@ 00 million mi@@ gran@@ t work@@ ers , 60 percent of them are young people ."
They find themselves sort of san@@ d@@ w@@ ich@@ ed between the ur@@ b@@ an are@@ as and the ru@@ ral are@@ as .
"Mo@@ st of them don &apos;t want to go back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , but they don &apos;t have the sense of bel@@ on@@ ging ."
"They work for longer hours with less in@@ come , less social w@@ el@@ f@@ are ."
"And they &apos;re more v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able to job lo@@ s@@ ses , sub@@ ject to inf@@ l@@ ation , ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing lo@@ ans from ban@@ ks , ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of the ren@@ min@@ b@@ i , or de@@ cl@@ ine of de@@ m@@ and from Euro@@ pe or America for the produc@@ ts they produ@@ ce ."
"L@@ ast year , though , an app@@ all@@ ing in@@ ci@@ dent in a s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n O@@ E@@ M man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing com@@ po@@ u@@ nd in China : 1@@ 3 young work@@ ers in their l@@ ate te@@ ens and early 20@@ s comm@@ it@@ ted su@@ ici@@ de , just one by one like cau@@ sing a con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous disease ."
But they di@@ ed because of all different pers@@ onal reas@@ ons .
"But this whole in@@ ci@@ dent a@@ ro@@ used a huge out@@ c@@ ry from society about the is@@ ol@@ ation , both physi@@ cal and mental , of these mi@@ gran@@ t work@@ ers ."
"For those who do re@@ turn back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , they find themselves very w@@ el@@ come lo@@ cally , because with the knowled@@ ge , sk@@ ill@@ s and net@@ works they have learned in the cities , with the as@@ si@@ stance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more j@@ ob@@ s , up@@ gra@@ de local ag@@ ri@@ culture and create new business in the less develop@@ ed market ."
"So for the past few years , the co@@ ast@@ al are@@ as , they found themselves in a shor@@ ta@@ ge of lab@@ or ."
These diag@@ ra@@ ms show a more gener@@ al social back@@ ground .
"The first one is the En@@ g@@ els co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent , which expla@@ ins that the cost of da@@ ily ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ities has dro@@ pped its perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge all through the past de@@ ca@@ de , in terms of family in@@ come , to about 3@@ 7@@ -@@ some percent ."
"But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 3@@ 9 percent , indi@@ c@@ ating a ri@@ sing living cost ."
The G@@ in@@ i co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent has already pas@@ sed the dan@@ ger@@ ous line of 0@@ .@@ 4 .
Now it &apos;s 0@@ .@@ 5 — even wor@@ se than that in America — sho@@ wing us the in@@ come in@@ equ@@ ality .
And so you see this whole society getting f@@ ru@@ strat@@ ed about lo@@ sing some of its mobil@@ ity .
"And also , the b@@ it@@ ter@@ ness and even res@@ ent@@ ment to@@ wards the ri@@ ch and the powerful is quite wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ."
So any acc@@ us@@ ations of cor@@ rup@@ tion or back@@ do@@ or de@@ al@@ ings between au@@ th@@ or@@ ities or business would a@@ rou@@ se a social out@@ c@@ ry or even un@@ re@@ st .
"So through some of the hot@@ test to@@ pic@@ s on micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ing , we can see what young people care most about ."
So@@ cial ju@@ st@@ ice and government ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bil@@ ity ru@@ ns the first in what they de@@ m@@ and .
"For the past de@@ ca@@ de or so , a mas@@ sive ur@@ ban@@ iz@@ ation and develop@@ ment have let us w@@ it@@ ness a lot of re@@ por@@ ts on the for@@ ced de@@ mol@@ ition of priv@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ty ."
And it has a@@ ro@@ used huge an@@ ger and f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation am@@ ong our young gener@@ ation .
"S@@ omet@@ imes people get kill@@ ed , and sometimes people set themselves on fi@@ re to pro@@ test ."
"So when these in@@ ci@@ d@@ ents are re@@ por@@ ted more and more fre@@ qu@@ ently on the Internet , people c@@ ry for the government to take ac@@ tions to stop this ."
"So the good news is that ear@@ li@@ er this year , the state coun@@ ci@@ l pas@@ sed a new regul@@ ation on house re@@ qu@@ is@@ ition and de@@ mol@@ ition and pas@@ sed the right to order for@@ ced de@@ mol@@ ition from local govern@@ ments to the cour@@ t ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , many other issu@@ es con@@ cer@@ ning public sa@@ f@@ ety is a ho@@ t to@@ pi@@ c on the Internet ."
"We heard about pol@@ l@@ ut@@ ed air , pol@@ l@@ ut@@ ed water , pois@@ on@@ ed food ."
"And gu@@ ess what , we have fak@@ ed be@@ e@@ f ."
"They have sor@@ ts of in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that you b@@ ru@@ sh on a piece of ch@@ ick@@ en or fish , and it turns it to look like be@@ e@@ f ."
"And then l@@ ately , people are very con@@ cer@@ ned about co@@ oking oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; re@@ fin@@ ing &#93; co@@ oking oil from re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant slo@@ p ."
So all these things have a@@ ro@@ used a huge out@@ c@@ ry from the Internet .
"And for@@ tun@@ ately , we have seen the government respon@@ ding more tim@@ ely and also more fre@@ qu@@ ently to the public con@@ cer@@ ns ."
"Wh@@ ile young people se@@ em to be very sure about their parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation in public po@@ lic@@ y-@@ making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their pers@@ onal life ."
China is so@@ on to pas@@ s the U.@@ S.
as the number one market for lu@@ x@@ ury b@@ ran@@ ds — that &apos;s not inclu@@ ding the Ch@@ in@@ ese ex@@ pen@@ dit@@ ures in Euro@@ pe and el@@ se@@ where .
"But you know what , half of those con@@ su@@ mer@@ s are ear@@ ning a s@@ al@@ ary bel@@ ow 2@@ ,000 U.@@ S. dollars ."
They &apos;re not ri@@ ch at all .
They &apos;re taking those b@@ ag@@ s and clo@@ th@@ es as a sense of id@@ ent@@ ity and social stat@@ us .
And this is a girl ex@@ p@@ lic@@ it@@ ly saying on a T@@ V dat@@ ing show that she would rather c@@ ry in a B@@ M@@ W than sm@@ ile on a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
"But of course , we do have young people who would still pre@@ f@@ er to sm@@ ile , whether in a B@@ M@@ W or &#91; on &#93; a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle ."
"So in the next picture , you see a very popul@@ ar ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called &quot; &quot; na@@ ked &quot; &quot; w@@ ed@@ ding , or &quot; &quot; na@@ ked &quot; &quot; mar@@ ri@@ age ."
"It does not mean they will we@@ ar nothing in the w@@ ed@@ ding , but it shows that these young cou@@ ples are ready to get mar@@ ri@@ ed without a house , without a car , without a di@@ am@@ ond r@@ ing and without a w@@ ed@@ ding ban@@ qu@@ et , to show their comm@@ it@@ ment to true love ."
"And also , people are doing good through social medi@@ a ."
And the first picture sho@@ wed us that a tru@@ ck c@@ ag@@ ing 500 hom@@ el@@ ess and ki@@ d@@ na@@ pped do@@ gs for food proc@@ ess@@ ing was s@@ pot@@ ted and sto@@ pped on the high@@ way with the whole country wat@@ ching through micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ing .
"P@@ eople were don@@ ating money , do@@ g food and off@@ ering vol@@ un@@ te@@ er work to stop that tru@@ ck ."
"And after hours of ne@@ got@@ i@@ ation , 500 do@@ gs were res@@ cu@@ ed ."
And here also people are hel@@ ping to find mis@@ sing children .
A father post@@ ed his son &apos;s picture on@@ to the Internet .
"A@@ f@@ ter thousands of re@@ sen@@ ds in re@@ la@@ y , the child was found , and we w@@ it@@ nes@@ sed the re@@ uni@@ on of the family through micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ing ."
So happ@@ in@@ ess is the most popul@@ ar word we have heard through the past two years .
"H@@ app@@ in@@ ess is not only rel@@ ated to pers@@ onal experi@@ ences and pers@@ onal val@@ ues , but also , it &apos;s about the environment ."
P@@ eople are thinking about the fol@@ lo@@ wing questions : A@@ re we going to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice our environment f@@ ur@@ ther to produ@@ ce high@@ er G@@ D@@ P ?
"H@@ ow are we going to per@@ form our social and polit@@ ical re@@ form to keep p@@ ace with economic growth , to keep su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability and st@@ ability ?"
"And also , how cap@@ able is the system of self-@@ cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness to keep more people con@@ t@@ ent with all sor@@ ts of fri@@ ction going on at the same time ?"
I gu@@ ess these are the questions people are going to answer .
And our youn@@ ger gener@@ ation are going to trans@@ form this country while at the same time being trans@@ form@@ ed themselves .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
This back here was my brain cancer .
I@@ s@@ n &apos;t it ni@@ ce ?
"( Laughter ) The key ph@@ ra@@ se is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; ph@@ ew ."
"( Applause ) H@@ av@@ ing brain cancer was really , as you can imagine , sho@@ c@@ king news for me ."
I knew nothing about cancer .
"In W@@ ester@@ n cul@@ tures , when you have cancer , it &apos;s as if you dis@@ appe@@ ar in a way ."
"@@ Y@@ our life as a complex human being is re@@ plac@@ ed by medi@@ cal data : Y@@ our images , your exam@@ s , your la@@ b val@@ ues , a li@@ st of medi@@ c@@ ines ."
And everyone changes as well .
You sud@@ den@@ ly become a disease on le@@ gs .
D@@ oc@@ tors start spe@@ a@@ king a language which you don &apos;t understand .
They start poin@@ ting their fin@@ g@@ ers at your body and your images .
"P@@ eople start chang@@ ing as well because they start de@@ al@@ ing with the disease , instead of with the human being ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; What did the doc@@ tor say ? &quot; &quot; before even saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ell@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in the me@@ an@@ while , you &apos;re left with questions to which no@@ body gi@@ ves an answer ."
These are the &quot; &quot; C@@ an I ? &quot; &quot; questions : C@@ an I work while I have cancer ?
C@@ an I study ? C@@ an I make love ? C@@ an I be cre@@ ative ?
"And you won@@ der , &quot; &quot; What have I done to des@@ er@@ ve this ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I change something about my li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I do something ?"
"A@@ re there any other op@@ tions ? &quot; &quot; And , obvi@@ ously , doc@@ tors are the good guys in all these sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os , because they are very profes@@ si@@ onal and de@@ di@@ c@@ ated to cur@@ ing you ."
"But they also are very used to having to de@@ al with patients , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes lo@@ se the idea that this is tor@@ ture for you and that you become , liter@@ ally , a pati@@ ent — &quot; pati@@ ent &quot; means &quot; the one who wa@@ its . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) Th@@ ings are chang@@ ing , but clas@@ sically , they t@@ end to not eng@@ age you in any way to learn about your cond@@ ition , to get your friends and family eng@@ ag@@ ed , or sho@@ wing you ways in which you can change your li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le to min@@ im@@ ize the ri@@ sk@@ s of what you &apos;re going through ."
"But instead , you &apos;re for@@ ced there to wa@@ it in the hands of a seri@@ es of very profes@@ si@@ onal stran@@ g@@ ers ."
"Wh@@ ile I was in the hosp@@ ital , I asked for a prin@@ te@@ d-@@ out picture of my cancer and I spo@@ ke with it ."
"It was really hard to ob@@ tain , because it &apos;s not common pra@@ cti@@ ce to ask for a picture of your own cancer ."
"I tal@@ ked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me ."
There &apos;s more to me .
"A c@@ ure , wh@@ ich@@ ever it is , will have to de@@ al with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the hosp@@ ital against medi@@ cal ad@@ vice ."
I was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to change my relation@@ ship with the cancer and I was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as d@@ rast@@ ic as a sur@@ ger@@ y .
"I &apos;m an art@@ ist , I use sever@@ al form@@ s of op@@ en@@ -@@ sour@@ ce tech@@ nologi@@ es and open information in my pra@@ cti@@ ce ."
"So my best b@@ et was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be acc@@ ess@@ ed by any@@ one ."
"So I created a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , which is called L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a , on which I put my medi@@ cal data , on@@ line ."
I actually had to h@@ ack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another spe@@ ec@@ h .
"( Laughter ) I ch@@ ose this word , L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a — L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a in I@@ tal@@ i@@ an means &quot; &quot; the c@@ ure &quot; &quot; — because in many different cul@@ tures , the word &quot; &quot; c@@ ure &quot; &quot; can mean many different things ."
"In our W@@ ester@@ n cul@@ tures , it means er@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ ating or re@@ ver@@ sing a disease , but in different cul@@ tures , for example , a culture from A@@ si@@ a , from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ ean , from L@@ at@@ in countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things ."
"O@@ f course , I was interest@@ ed in the op@@ in@@ i@@ ons of doc@@ tors and heal@@ th@@ care pro@@ vi@@ ders , but I was also interest@@ ed in the c@@ ure of the art@@ ist , of the po@@ et , of the desig@@ ner , of , who kno@@ ws , the mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans ."
"I was interest@@ ed in the social c@@ ure , I was interest@@ ed in the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical c@@ ure , I was interest@@ ed in the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual c@@ ure , I was interest@@ ed in the emot@@ i@@ onal c@@ ure , I was interest@@ ed in any form of c@@ ure ."
"And , it worked ."
The L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite went vi@@ ral .
"I rec@@ ei@@ ved lots of medi@@ a atten@@ tion from I@@ tal@@ y and from ab@@ ro@@ ad and I quickly rec@@ ei@@ ved more than 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts — em@@ ail@@ s , social net@@ working — most of them were a su@@ gg@@ esti@@ on on how to c@@ ure my cancer , but more of them were about how to c@@ ure myself as a full individu@@ al ."
"For example , many thousands of vide@@ os , images , pic@@ tures , art per@@ form@@ an@@ ces were produc@@ ed for L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a ."
"For example , here we see Fran@@ c@@ es@@ ca F@@ in@@ i in her per@@ form@@ ance ."
"O@@ r , as art@@ ist P@@ atri@@ ck L@@ ich@@ ty has done : He produc@@ ed a 3@@ D s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture of my tu@@ mo@@ r and put it on s@@ ale on Th@@ in@@ gi@@ ver@@ se ."
"Now you can have my cancer , too !"
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich is a ni@@ ce thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer ."
"And this was going on — scientists , the trad@@ iti@@ onal medi@@ c@@ ine ex@@ per@@ ts , sever@@ al resear@@ ch@@ ers , doc@@ tors — all conne@@ cted with me to give ad@@ vice ."
"W@@ ith all this information and sup@@ port , I was able to form a team of sever@@ al ne@@ uro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons , trad@@ iti@@ onal doc@@ tors , on@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ sts , and sever@@ al hun@@ d@@ red vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with wh@@ om I was able to disc@@ us@@ s the information I was rec@@ ei@@ ving , which is very important ."
"And together , we were able to form a strate@@ gy for my own c@@ ure in many langu@@ ages , ac@@ cor@@ ding to many cul@@ tures ."
"And the cur@@ r@@ ent strate@@ gy sp@@ ans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite rem@@ ar@@ ka@@ ble for me ."
"@@ &#91; S@@ ur@@ ger@@ y &#93; The fol@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ up M@@ R@@ I@@ s sho@@ wed , lu@@ ck@@ ily , little to no growth of the cancer ."
So I was able to take my time and cho@@ ose .
"I ch@@ ose the doc@@ tor I wanted to work with , I ch@@ ose the hosp@@ ital I wanted to st@@ ay in , and in the me@@ an@@ while , I was sup@@ por@@ ted by thousands of people , no@@ ne of wh@@ om felt p@@ ity for me ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ one felt like they could take an ac@@ tive ro@@ le in hel@@ ping me to get well , and this was the most important part of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a ."
What are the out@@ comes ?
"I &apos;m f@@ ine , as you can see , pretty f@@ ine ."
"( Applause ) I had exc@@ ell@@ ent news after the sur@@ ger@@ y — I have — I had a very lo@@ w@@ -@@ gra@@ de gli@@ om@@ a , which is a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; kind of cancer which doesn &apos;t grow a lot ."
I have completely changed my life and my li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing I did was thou@@ gh@@ t@@ fully desig@@ ned to get me eng@@ ag@@ ed .
"U@@ p until the very last few minutes of the sur@@ ger@@ y , which was very in@@ ten@@ se , a mat@@ ri@@ x of elec@@ tro@@ des was im@@ plan@@ ted in my brain from this side , to be able to build a fun@@ cti@@ onal ma@@ p of what the brain contro@@ ls ."
"And right before the oper@@ ation , we were able to disc@@ us@@ s the fun@@ cti@@ onal ma@@ p of my brain with the doc@@ tor , to understand which ri@@ sk@@ s I was ru@@ n@@ ning into and if there were any I wanted to av@@ o@@ id ."
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , there were ."
&#91; O@@ p@@ en &#93; And this op@@ en@@ ness was really the fundam@@ en@@ tal part of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a .
"Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds of people sha@@ red their stories , their experi@@ ences ."
D@@ oc@@ tors got to talk with people they don &apos;t u@@ su@@ ally con@@ sul@@ t when they think about cancer .
"I &apos;m a self-@@ f@@ oun@@ ding , contin@@ u@@ ous state of tran@@ sl@@ ation am@@ ong many different langu@@ ages , in which science me@@ ets emot@@ ion and con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal research me@@ ets trad@@ iti@@ onal research ."
&#91; So@@ ci@@ ety &#93; The most important thing of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a was to feel like a part of a really eng@@ ag@@ ed and conne@@ cted society wh@@ ose w@@ ell@@ ness really de@@ pen@@ ds on the w@@ ell@@ ness of all of its com@@ pon@@ ents .
This global per@@ form@@ ance is my op@@ en@@ -@@ sour@@ ce c@@ ure for cancer .
"And from what I feel , it &apos;s a c@@ ure for me , but for us all ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
"A big chall@@ enge is , how should the i@@ P@@ ads be used , and what app@@ s should we put on the i@@ P@@ ads ?"
H@@ i everybody . So my name is Ma@@ c .
"I write children &apos;s bo@@ oks , and there &apos;s a quot@@ e from P@@ ab@@ lo P@@ ic@@ as@@ so , &quot; &quot; We all know that Ar@@ t is not tru@@ th ."
Ar@@ t is a li@@ e that makes us realiz@@ e tru@@ th or at least the tru@@ th that is given us to understand .
"The art@@ ist must know the man@@ ner wh@@ ere@@ by to con@@ vin@@ ce others of the tru@@ th@@ ful@@ ness of his li@@ es . &quot; &quot; I first heard this when I was a ki@@ d , and I lov@@ ed it , but I had no idea what it me@@ ant ."
"( Laughter ) So I thought , you know what , it &apos;s what I &apos;m here to talk to you today about , though , tru@@ th and li@@ es , fic@@ tion and reality ."
So how could I un@@ tan@@ g@@ le this k@@ not@@ ted bu@@ n@@ ch of sent@@ ences ?
"And I said , I &apos;ve got Po@@ wer@@ Po@@ in@@ t . Let &apos;s do a V@@ en@@ n diag@@ ra@@ m ."

"We &apos;ve got tru@@ th and li@@ es and then there &apos;s this little space , the ed@@ ge , in the middle ."
"That li@@ min@@ al space , that &apos;s art ."
All right . V@@ en@@ n diag@@ ra@@ m . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very hel@@ p@@ ful ei@@ ther .
"The thing that made me understand that quot@@ e and really kind of what art , at least the art of fic@@ tion , was , was working with kids ."
I used to be a sum@@ mer cam@@ p coun@@ sel@@ or .
"I would do it on my sum@@ mer@@ s off from colle@@ ge , and I lov@@ ed it ."
It was a s@@ por@@ ts sum@@ mer cam@@ p for f@@ our@@ - to si@@ x@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds .
"I was in ch@@ ar@@ ge of the f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds , which is good , because f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds can &apos;t play s@@ por@@ ts , and ne@@ i@@ ther can I@@ ."
"I would tell them about how , on the we@@ ek@@ ends , I would go home and I would sp@@ y for the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of En@@ gl@@ and ."
"And so@@ on , other kids who wer@@ en &apos;t even in my group of kids , they would come up to me , and they would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re Ma@@ c B@@ ar@@ net@@ t , right ?"
You &apos;re the guy who sp@@ ies for the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of En@@ gl@@ and . &quot; &quot; And I had been wa@@ iting my whole life for stran@@ g@@ ers to come up and ask me that question .
"In my fanta@@ sy , they were s@@ vel@@ te R@@ us@@ si@@ an women , but , you know , f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds — you take what you can get in B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was famili@@ ar to me and really exc@@ iting .
"I think the p@@ in@@ na@@ cle of this for me — I &apos;ll never for@@ get this — there was this little girl na@@ med R@@ il@@ ey . She was tiny , and she used to always take out her l@@ un@@ ch every day and she would th@@ row out her f@@ ru@@ it ."
"S@@ he would just take her f@@ ru@@ it , her mom p@@ ac@@ ked her a mel@@ on every day , and she would just th@@ row it in the i@@ vy and then she would e@@ at f@@ ru@@ it s@@ na@@ cks and pu@@ d@@ ding cu@@ ps , and I was like , &quot; &quot; R@@ il@@ ey , you can &apos;t do that , you have to e@@ at the f@@ ru@@ it . &quot; &quot; And she was like , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , when you th@@ row the f@@ ru@@ it in the i@@ vy , pretty so@@ on , it &apos;s going to be over@@ gro@@ wn with mel@@ ons , &quot; &quot; which is why I think I en@@ ded up telling stories to children and not being a nu@@ tr@@ iti@@ on@@ ist for children ."
"And so R@@ il@@ ey was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen ."
"That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot; &quot; And so , on the last day of cam@@ p , I got up early and I got a big can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe from the gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore and I h@@ id it in the i@@ vy , and then at l@@ un@@ cht@@ im@@ e , I was like , &quot; R@@ il@@ ey , why don &apos;t you go over there and see what you &apos;ve done . &quot;"
"And — ( Laughter ) — she went trud@@ ging through the i@@ vy , and then her eyes just got so wi@@ de , and she poin@@ ted out this mel@@ on that was bi@@ g@@ ger than her head , and then all the kids ran over there and ru@@ shed around her , and one of the kids was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why is there a st@@ ick@@ er on this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; That is also why I say do not th@@ row your st@@ ick@@ ers in the i@@ vy ."
"P@@ ut them in the t@@ ras@@ h can . It ru@@ ins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And R@@ il@@ ey car@@ ri@@ ed that mel@@ on around with her all day , and she was so pro@@ u@@ d ."
"And R@@ il@@ ey knew she didn &apos;t grow a mel@@ on in se@@ ven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a we@@ ird place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to ."
It &apos;s anything . Ar@@ t can get us to that place .
"S@@ he was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fic@@ tion ."
I &apos;m going to call it won@@ der .
"It &apos;s what C@@ ol@@ eri@@ d@@ ge called the w@@ ill@@ ing su@@ sp@@ en@@ sion of dis@@ beli@@ e@@ f or po@@ et@@ ic fa@@ ith , for those mo@@ ments where a story , no matter how stran@@ ge , has some sem@@ bl@@ ance of the tru@@ th , and then you &apos;re able to believe it ."
It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
"A@@ du@@ l@@ ts can too , and we get there when we read ."

"K@@ i@@ ds can get there a lot more eas@@ ily than a@@ du@@ l@@ ts can , and that &apos;s why I love writ@@ ing for kids ."
I think kids are the best audi@@ ence for seri@@ ous liter@@ ary fic@@ tion .

And I was con@@ vin@@ ced that se@@ cre@@ t do@@ ors really did ex@@ ist and I would look for them and try to go through them .
"I wanted to live and c@@ ross over into that fic@@ ti@@ onal world , which is — I would always just open people &apos;s clo@@ set do@@ ors . ( Laughter ) I would just go through my mom &apos;s bo@@ y@@ friend &apos;s clo@@ set , and there was not a se@@ cre@@ t mag@@ ical land there ."
There was some other we@@ ird stuff that I think my mom should know about .
( Laughter ) And I was happy to tell her all about it .
"A@@ f@@ ter colle@@ ge , my first job was working behind one of these se@@ cre@@ t do@@ ors ."
This is a place called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a .
"It &apos;s at 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a S@@ tre@@ et in the M@@ is@@ sion in S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , and when I worked there , there was a publi@@ sh@@ ing company he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ed there called M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s , a no@@ n@@ prof@@ it writ@@ ing cent@@ er called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a , but then the front of it was a stran@@ ge sho@@ p ."
"You see , this place was z@@ on@@ ed re@@ ta@@ il , and in S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , they were not going to give us a vari@@ ance , and so the writ@@ er who f@@ oun@@ ded it , a writ@@ er na@@ med D@@ ave E@@ gg@@ ers , to come into comp@@ li@@ ance with c@@ ode , he said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine , I &apos;m just going to build a pi@@ rate sup@@ ply st@@ ore . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what he did . ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s all wo@@ od ."
There &apos;s dra@@ wers you can pul@@ l out and get c@@ it@@ ru@@ s so you don &apos;t get sc@@ ur@@ vy .
"They have e@@ y@@ ep@@ at@@ ch@@ es in lots of col@@ ors , because when it &apos;s sp@@ r@@ ing@@ time , pi@@ rat@@ es want to go w@@ il@@ d ."

"And the st@@ ore , stran@@ g@@ ely , people came to them and b@@ ou@@ ght things , and they en@@ ded up pa@@ ying the r@@ ent for our tu@@ tor@@ ing cent@@ er , which was behind it , but to me , more important was the fact that I think the qu@@ ality of work you do , kids would come and get instru@@ ction in writ@@ ing , and when you have to walk this we@@ ird , li@@ min@@ al , fic@@ ti@@ onal space like this to go do your writ@@ ing , it &apos;s going to aff@@ ect the kind of work that you make ."
It &apos;s a se@@ cre@@ t do@@ or that you can walk through .
"So I ran the 8@@ 2@@ 6 in L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es , and it was my job to build the st@@ ore down there ."
So we have The E@@ ch@@ o Par@@ k T@@ im@@ e T@@ rav@@ el Mar@@ t .

"And V@@ i@@ king Od@@ or@@ ant , which comes in lots of great sc@@ ents : to@@ en@@ ail@@ s , s@@ we@@ at and rot@@ ten ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les , py@@ re ash ."
"Because we believe that A@@ x@@ e B@@ ody S@@ pra@@ y is something that you should only find on the bat@@ t@@ le@@ fiel@@ d , not under your ar@@ ms . ( Laughter ) And these are robot emot@@ ion chi@@ ps , so robot@@ s can feel love or fe@@ ar ."
"O@@ ur bi@@ gg@@ est sel@@ l@@ er is S@@ cha@@ den@@ fre@@ u@@ de , which we did not expe@@ ct ."
( Laughter ) We did not think that was going to happen .
"But there &apos;s a no@@ n@@ prof@@ it behind it , and kids go through a do@@ or that says &quot; &quot; E@@ m@@ plo@@ ye@@ es O@@ n@@ ly &quot; &quot; and they end up in this space where they do hom@@ e@@ work and write stories and make fil@@ ms and this is a book re@@ le@@ ase par@@ ty where kids will read ."
"There &apos;s a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly that &apos;s publi@@ shed with just writ@@ ing that &apos;s done by the kids who come every day after school , and we have re@@ le@@ ase parti@@ es and they e@@ at ca@@ ke and read for their parents and d@@ rin@@ k mil@@ k out of ch@@ am@@ p@@ ag@@ ne glas@@ ses ."
"And it &apos;s a very speci@@ al space , because it &apos;s this we@@ ird space in the front ."
The jo@@ ke isn &apos;t a jo@@ ke .
"You can &apos;t find the se@@ am@@ s on the fic@@ tion , and I love that . It &apos;s this little bit of fic@@ tion that &apos;s col@@ on@@ iz@@ ed the real world ."
I see it as kind of a book in three d@@ imen@@ sions .
"There &apos;s a ter@@ m called met@@ af@@ ic@@ tion , and that &apos;s just stories about stories , and met@@ a &apos;s having a moment now ."
"I@@ ts last big moment was probably in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s with nov@@ el@@ ist@@ s like J@@ oh@@ n B@@ ar@@ th and W@@ illi@@ am G@@ add@@ is , but it &apos;s been around ."
It &apos;s almost as old as stor@@ y@@ telling itself .
And one met@@ af@@ ic@@ tive tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e is bre@@ a@@ king the f@@ our@@ th w@@ all . R@@ ight ?
"It &apos;s when an ac@@ tor will turn to the audi@@ ence and say , &quot; &quot; I am an ac@@ tor , these are just ra@@ f@@ ters . &quot; &quot; And even that sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly h@@ on@@ est moment , I would argu@@ e , is in ser@@ vice of the li@@ e , but it &apos;s sup@@ posed to fore@@ ground the arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ality of the fic@@ tion ."
"For me , I kind of pre@@ f@@ er the op@@ pos@@ ite ."
"If I &apos;m going to bre@@ ak down the f@@ our@@ th w@@ all , I want fic@@ tion to es@@ cap@@ e and come into the real world ."
I want a book to be a se@@ cre@@ t do@@ or that op@@ ens and l@@ ets the stories out into reality .
And so I try to do this in my bo@@ oks .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; B@@ il@@ ly T@@ w@@ it@@ ters and his B@@ lu@@ e Wh@@ ale Pro@@ bl@@ em . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s about a ki@@ d who gets a bl@@ ue wh@@ ale as a p@@ et but it &apos;s a pu@@ ni@@ sh@@ ment and it ru@@ ins his life .
So it &apos;s deli@@ ver@@ ed over@@ night by F@@ ed@@ U@@ p .
( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
He lives in S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o — very t@@ ough city to own a bl@@ ue wh@@ ale in .
"A lot of h@@ ill@@ s , real est@@ ate is at a pre@@ mi@@ um ."
"This market &apos;s c@@ raz@@ y , everybody ."
"But under@@ ne@@ ath the ja@@ ck@@ et is this case , and that &apos;s the c@@ over under@@ ne@@ ath the book , the ja@@ ck@@ et , and there &apos;s an ad that off@@ ers a free 3@@ 0-@@ day ri@@ sk@@ -@@ free tri@@ al for a bl@@ ue wh@@ ale ."
And you can just sen@@ d in a self-@@ add@@ res@@ sed st@@ am@@ ped en@@ vel@@ op@@ e and we &apos;ll sen@@ d you a wh@@ ale .
And kids do write in .
"So here &apos;s a let@@ ter . It says , &quot; &quot; De@@ ar people , I b@@ et you 10 bu@@ cks you won &apos;t sen@@ d me a bl@@ ue wh@@ ale ."
"E@@ li@@ ot G@@ an@@ no@@ n ( age 6 ) . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So what E@@ li@@ ot and the other kids who sen@@ d these in get back is a let@@ ter in very small prin@@ t from a Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an la@@ w fi@@ r@@ m — ( Laughter ) — that says that du@@ e to a change in cu@@ st@@ om@@ s la@@ ws , their wh@@ ale has been hel@@ d up in S@@ og@@ nef@@ j@@ or@@ d , which is a very lov@@ ely f@@ j@@ or@@ d , and then it just kind of tal@@ ks about S@@ og@@ nef@@ j@@ or@@ d and Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an food for a little while . It di@@ gres@@ ses . ( Laughter )"
But it fin@@ ish@@ es off by saying that your wh@@ ale would love to hear from you .
"He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a mes@@ sage ."
"And when you call and leave him a mes@@ sage , you just , on the out@@ going mes@@ sage , it &apos;s just wh@@ ale s@@ oun@@ ds and then a be@@ ep , which actually s@@ oun@@ ds a lot like a wh@@ ale sound ."
And they get a picture of their wh@@ ale too .
"So this is R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph , and R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph bel@@ on@@ gs to a ki@@ d na@@ med N@@ ic@@ o who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s mes@@ sage ."
This is the first mes@@ sage I ever got from N@@ ic@@ o .
"( A@@ udi@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ ell@@ o , this is N@@ ic@@ o ."
"I am your ow@@ ner , R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph . H@@ ell@@ o ."
"So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you so@@ on another day . B@@ ye ."
"M@@ a@@ c B@@ ar@@ net@@ t : So N@@ ic@@ o called back , like , an h@@ our later ."
( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s mes@@ sa@@ ges .
"( A@@ udi@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ ell@@ o , R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph , this is N@@ ic@@ o ."
"I hav@@ en &apos;t tal@@ ked to you for a long time , but I tal@@ ked to you on S@@ at@@ ur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , ye@@ ah , S@@ at@@ ur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , so now I &apos;m call@@ ing you again to say h@@ ell@@ o and I won@@ der what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tom@@ or@@ row or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . B@@ ye ."
"M@@ B : So he did , he called back that day again ."
He &apos;s left over 25 mes@@ sa@@ ges for R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph over four years .
"You find out all about him and the gran@@ d@@ ma that he lov@@ es and the gran@@ d@@ ma that he lik@@ es a little bit less — ( Laughter ) — and the c@@ ros@@ s@@ word pu@@ z@@ z@@ les that he does , and this is — I &apos;ll play you one more mes@@ sage from N@@ ic@@ o ."
This is the Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as mes@@ sage from N@@ ic@@ o .
"@@ &#91; B@@ e@@ ep &#93; ( A@@ udi@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ ell@@ o , R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph , sor@@ ry I hav@@ en &apos;t tal@@ ked to you in a long time ."
"It &apos;s just that I &apos;ve been so bu@@ sy because school started , as you might not know , probably , since you &apos;re a wh@@ ale , you don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m call@@ ing you to just say , to w@@ ish you a mer@@ ry Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as ."
"So have a ni@@ ce Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , and by@@ e-@@ by@@ e , R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph . Go@@ od@@ by@@ e ."
"M@@ B : I actually got N@@ ic@@ o , I ha@@ dn &apos;t heard from in 18 months , and he just left a mes@@ sage two days ago ."
"H@@ is vo@@ ice is completely different , but he put his bab@@ y@@ sit@@ ter on the phone , and she was very ni@@ ce to R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph as well ."
But N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s the best read@@ er I could hope for .
I would want any@@ one I was writ@@ ing for to be in that place emot@@ i@@ on@@ ally with the things that I create .
"I feel lu@@ ck@@ y . K@@ i@@ ds like N@@ ic@@ o are the best re@@ a@@ ders , and they des@@ er@@ ve the best stories we can give them ."
Thank you very much .

"And then I &apos;ll kind of be like — ( V@@ v@@ v@@ w@@ ow ! ) — and then they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; W@@ ho@@ a ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m sure you &apos;re trying to figure out , &quot; Well , how does this thing work ? &quot;"
"Well , what I &apos;m doing is contro@@ l@@ ling the pit@@ ch with my left hand ."
"S@@ ee , the clo@@ s@@ er I get to this an@@ ten@@ na , the high@@ er the not@@ e gets — ( P@@ or@@ ta@@ men@@ to ) — and you can get it really low ."

"( T@@ ones ) So basically , with both of your hands you &apos;re contro@@ l@@ ling pit@@ ch and vol@@ u@@ me and kind of trying to create the il@@ lu@@ sion that you &apos;re doing se@@ par@@ ate not@@ es , when really it &apos;s contin@@ u@@ ously going ..@@ ."

"( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are com@@ mon@@ ly asked ; there are so many ."
"And ... Well , I gu@@ ess I could tell you a little of the history of the ther@@ em@@ in ."
"It was inv@@ ented around the 19@@ 20@@ s , and the inv@@ en@@ tor , L@@ é@@ on Th@@ er@@ em@@ in — he also was a mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an bes@@ id@@ es an inv@@ en@@ tor — he came up with the idea for making the ther@@ em@@ in , I think , when he was working on some shor@@ tw@@ ave radi@@ os ."
"And there &apos;d be that sound in the sig@@ nal — it &apos;s like ( S@@ cre@@ ech@@ ing ) — and he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instru@@ ment , because there are pit@@ ch@@ es in it . &quot; &quot; And so some@@ how through develop@@ ing that , he ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally came to make the ther@@ em@@ in the way it is now ."
"And a lot of times , even kids no@@ wa@@ days , they &apos;ll make re@@ fer@@ ence to a ther@@ em@@ in by going , &quot; &quot; W@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 5@@ 0s it was used in the sci@@ -@@ f@@ i hor@@ ro@@ r mo@@ vi@@ es , that sound that &apos;s like ...

"And sometimes if I have too much co@@ ff@@ ee , then my vi@@ bra@@ to gets out of hand ."
You &apos;re really sen@@ s@@ itive to your body and its fun@@ ctions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
You have to st@@ ay so still if you want to have the most control .
"It rem@@ in@@ ds me of the bal@@ an@@ cing act ear@@ li@@ er on — what M@@ i@@ cha@@ el was doing — because you &apos;re fi@@ gh@@ ting so hard to keep the bal@@ ance with what you &apos;re pla@@ ying with and st@@ ay in tu@@ ne , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to foc@@ us so much on being in tu@@ ne all the time ; you want to be feel@@ ing the music ."
"And then also , you &apos;re trying to st@@ ay very , very , very still because little move@@ ments with other parts of your body will aff@@ ect the pit@@ ch , or sometimes if you &apos;re hol@@ ding a low not@@ e — ( T@@ one ri@@ sing out of key ) — and bre@@ a@@ thing will make it ..@@ ."
( Laughter ) If I pas@@ s out on the next s@@ ong ... ( Laughter )
"I think of it almost like like a y@@ og@@ a instru@@ ment because it makes you so aw@@ are of every little c@@ raz@@ y thing your body is doing , or just aw@@ are of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re pla@@ ying ; you don &apos;t want to have any sud@@ den move@@ ments ."
"And if I go to a clu@@ b and play a gi@@ g , people are like , &quot; Here , have some d@@ rin@@ ks on us ! &quot;"
"And it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m about to go on so@@ on ; I don &apos;t want to be like — ( T@@ e@@ et@@ ering t@@ ones ) — you know ? &quot; &quot; It really does re@@ fle@@ ct the mo@@ od that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ..@@ ."
"@@ it &apos;s si@@ mil@@ ar to being a vo@@ cal@@ ist , exc@@ ept instead of it coming out of your th@@ ro@@ at , you &apos;re contro@@ l@@ ling it just in the air and you don &apos;t really have a point of re@@ fer@@ ence ; you &apos;re always rel@@ ying on your ear@@ s and ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ing con@@ stan@@ tly ."

"In Par@@ is , from the U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O H@@ e@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters to a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
And students both in S@@ w@@ it@@ zer@@ land and fav@@ el@@ as in R@@ i@@ o de J@@ an@@ e@@ ir@@ o .
"A@@ ll kinds of beli@@ ef@@ s , gen@@ der id@@ ent@@ ities or physi@@ cal im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ments , a ne@@ w@@ born or ter@@ min@@ ally ill ."
We all together build H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e .
Th@@ ose por@@ tra@@ its make us re@@ think how we see each other .
"When mo@@ der@@ n science is questi@@ on@@ ing the ra@@ ce conc@@ ept , what does it mean for us to be black , white , y@@ el@@ low , red ?"
"I@@ s it the e@@ ye , the no@@ se , the m@@ outh , the ha@@ ir ?"
"O@@ r does it have to do with our orig@@ in , n@@ ation@@ ality or b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t ?"
This pers@@ onal ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se turned out to be a discover@@ y .
S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly I realized that H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e was u@@ se@@ ful for many people .
It re@@ pres@@ ents a sort of mir@@ ro@@ r for those who can@@ not find themselves re@@ fle@@ cted in any la@@ be@@ l .
It was amazing that people started to share their thou@@ ghts about the work with me .
"I have hun@@ dre@@ ds of that , I will share with you , too ."
"A mother of 11 years — A mother of an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old girl w@@ ro@@ te me , &quot; &quot; V@@ ery good for me as a to@@ ol to work on her con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence , as this past we@@ ek@@ end one of her gir@@ l@@ friends argu@@ ed with her that she does not bel@@ ong and should not be allo@@ wed to live in Nor@@ way ."
"So your work has a very speci@@ al place in my heart and it &apos;s very important for me . &quot; &quot; A woman sha@@ red her por@@ tra@@ it on F@@ ace@@ book and w@@ ro@@ te , &quot; &quot; All my life , people from across the glob@@ e had difficul@@ ti@@ es to place me in a group , a st@@ ere@@ ot@@ y@@ pe , a bo@@ x ."
Per@@ haps we should stop .
"In@@ st@@ ead of fra@@ ming , ask the individu@@ al , &apos; How would you la@@ be@@ l y@@ ourself ? &apos; Th@@ en I would say , &apos; H@@ i . I &apos;m M@@ as@@ si@@ el ."
"I &apos;m a D@@ om@@ in@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ D@@ ut@@ ch , I gre@@ w up in a mi@@ x@@ ed family and I &apos;m a bi@@ se@@ x@@ ual woman . &apos; &quot; &quot; B@@ es@@ id@@ es these u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted and tou@@ ching re@@ ac@@ tions , H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e fin@@ ds a new life in a different vari@@ ety of fiel@@ ds ."
"@@ Ju@@ st to show you some exam@@ ples , il@@ lu@@ strat@@ ors and art students using it as a re@@ fer@@ ence for their sk@@ et@@ ch@@ es and their studi@@ es ."
It &apos;s a colle@@ ction of fac@@ es .

"One of the most important imp@@ ac@@ ts of the project is that H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e was cho@@ se@@ n to be the c@@ over of F@@ ore@@ ig@@ n A@@ ff@@ air@@ s , one of the most re@@ lev@@ ant polit@@ ical publi@@ c@@ ations ."
"And talking about fore@@ ig@@ n aff@@ air@@ s , I found the perf@@ ect am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors for my project ..@@ ."
teach@@ ers .
They are the ones that use H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e as a to@@ ol for educ@@ ational pur@@ pos@@ es .
"Th@@ e@@ ir pas@@ sion en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ges me to go back to dra@@ wing clas@@ ses , but this time as a teach@@ er myself ."
"My students , both a@@ du@@ l@@ ts and kids , pain@@ t their self-@@ por@@ tra@@ its , trying to disc@@ over their own uni@@ qu@@ e col@@ or ."
"As a photogra@@ ph@@ er , I realiz@@ e that I can be a chan@@ ne@@ l for others to communic@@ ate ."
"As an individu@@ al , as An@@ g@@ é@@ lic@@ a , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sit@@ ting in front of a ther@@ ap@@ ist ."
"A@@ ll the f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation , fe@@ ar and lon@@ el@@ in@@ ess that I once felt ..@@ ."
be@@ comes love .
"The last country — the last country in the world who ab@@ ol@@ ish@@ ed sl@@ av@@ ery is the country where I was born , B@@ raz@@ il ."
We still have to work hard to ab@@ ol@@ ish dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation .
"That re@@ ma@@ ins a common pra@@ cti@@ ce wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de , and that will not dis@@ appe@@ ar by itself ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
I &apos;m very for@@ tun@@ ate to be here .
I feel so for@@ tun@@ ate .
I &apos;ve been so im@@ pres@@ sed by the kin@@ d@@ ness ex@@ pres@@ sed to me .
"I called my wi@@ fe L@@ es@@ li@@ e , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good ."
It feel@@ s like I &apos;ve lan@@ ded in a col@@ ony of ang@@ els . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true feel@@ ing .
But let me get to the talk — I see the clo@@ ck is ru@@ n@@ ning .
"I &apos;m a public school teach@@ er , and I just want to share a story of my super@@ in@@ ten@@ dent ."
"H@@ er name is P@@ am M@@ or@@ an in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty , V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , the fo@@ o@@ th@@ ill@@ s of the B@@ lu@@ e R@@ id@@ ge M@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ."
And she &apos;s a very high@@ -@@ te@@ ch super@@ in@@ ten@@ dent .
"S@@ he us@@ es sm@@ art bo@@ ar@@ ds , she blo@@ gs , she T@@ we@@ ets , she does F@@ ace@@ book , she does all this sort of high@@ -@@ te@@ ch stuff ."
She &apos;s a technology le@@ ad@@ er and instru@@ cti@@ onal le@@ ad@@ er .
"But in her off@@ ice , there &apos;s this old wo@@ od@@ en , we@@ a@@ ther@@ -@@ wor@@ n table , kit@@ ch@@ en table — pe@@ el@@ ing gre@@ en pain@@ t , it &apos;s kind of ri@@ ck@@ ety ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ am , you &apos;re such a mo@@ der@@ n , c@@ ut@@ tin@@ g@@ -@@ ed@@ ge person ."
"Wh@@ y is this old table in your off@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I gre@@ w up in S@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ ester@@ n V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , in the co@@ al min@@ es and the far@@ m@@ lan@@ ds of ru@@ ral V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , and this table was in my gran@@ d@@ father &apos;s kit@@ ch@@ en ."
"And we &apos;d come in from pla@@ ying , he &apos;d come in from plo@@ wing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , I heard so much knowled@@ ge and so many in@@ si@@ ghts and so much w@@ is@@ dom come out around this table , I beg@@ an to call it the w@@ is@@ dom table ."
"And when he pas@@ sed on , I took this table with me and b@@ rou@@ ght it to my off@@ ice , and it rem@@ in@@ ds me of him ."
"It rem@@ in@@ ds me of what goes on around an em@@ p@@ ty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the Wor@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace G@@ ame , and es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally it is also an em@@ p@@ ty space ."
"And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 2@@ 1@@ st century w@@ is@@ dom table , really ."
It all started back in 19@@ 7@@ 7 .
"I was a young man , and I had been dro@@ pp@@ ing in and out of colle@@ ge ."
"And my parents were very pati@@ ent , but I had been doing inter@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ent so@@ jour@@ ns to India on a my@@ st@@ ical qu@@ est ."
"And I remember the last time I came back from India — in my long white flo@@ wing rob@@ es and my big be@@ ard and my J@@ oh@@ n L@@ en@@ no@@ n glas@@ ses — and I said to my father , &quot; D@@ ad , I think I &apos;ve just about found sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , da@@ d ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they ple@@ ad@@ ed with me to get a de@@ gre@@ e in something ."
So I got a de@@ gre@@ e and it turned out to be education .
It was an experim@@ en@@ tal education progra@@ m .
"It could have been d@@ enti@@ stry , but the word &quot; &quot; experim@@ en@@ tal &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for ."
"And I went in for a job inter@@ view in the R@@ ich@@ mon@@ d P@@ u@@ bli@@ c S@@ cho@@ ols in V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , the cap@@ ital city , b@@ ou@@ ght a thre@@ e-@@ piece su@@ it — my conc@@ es@@ sion to con@@ ven@@ tion — k@@ ept my long be@@ ard and my af@@ ro and my plat@@ form sho@@ es — at the time it was the &apos; 7@@ 0s — and I wal@@ ked in , and I s@@ at down and had an inter@@ view ."
"And I gu@@ ess they were hard up for teach@@ ers because the super@@ vis@@ or , her name was An@@ na Ar@@ o , said I had the job teach@@ ing gi@@ f@@ ted children ."
"And I was so sho@@ c@@ ked , so st@@ un@@ ned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , th@@ ank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) G@@ i@@ f@@ ted education ha@@ dn &apos;t really taken h@@ old too much ."
There wer@@ en &apos;t really many materi@@ als or things to use .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer sho@@ c@@ ked me . It st@@ un@@ ned me ."
H@@ er answer set the tem@@ pl@@ ate for the entire care@@ er I was to have after that .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question cle@@ a@@ red the space ."
"There was no progra@@ m direc@@ tive , no man@@ ual to fol@@ low , no stan@@ dar@@ ds in gi@@ f@@ ted education in that way ."
"And she cle@@ a@@ red such a space that I en@@ de@@ av@@ o@@ red from then on to clear a space for my students , an em@@ p@@ ty space , wh@@ ere@@ by they could create and make me@@ an@@ ing out of their own under@@ standing ."
"So this happened in 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and I was teach@@ ing many years later , and a friend of m@@ ine in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed me to a young fil@@ m@@ mak@@ er ."
H@@ is name is Ch@@ ris F@@ ar@@ ina .
Ch@@ ris F@@ ar@@ ina is here today at his own cost .
"Ch@@ ris , could you stand up and let them see you — a young , vi@@ sion@@ ary fil@@ m@@ mak@@ er who &apos;s made a fil@@ m ."
( Applause ) This fil@@ m is called &quot; &quot; Wor@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace and O@@ ther 4@@ th G@@ ra@@ de A@@ chi@@ ev@@ e@@ ments . &quot; &quot; He pro@@ posed the fil@@ m to me — it &apos;s a great t@@ it@@ le .
"He pro@@ posed the fil@@ m to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local T@@ V , and we can say h@@ i to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the fil@@ m has really gone places ."
"Now it &apos;s still in de@@ b@@ t , but Ch@@ ris has manag@@ ed , through his own s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice , to get this fil@@ m out ."
"So we made a fil@@ m and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teach@@ er ."
It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a test@@ am@@ ent to teach@@ ing and teach@@ ers .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
"And the stran@@ ge thing is , when I wat@@ ch the fil@@ m — I have the e@@ eri@@ e sen@@ s@@ ation of seeing it — I saw myself liter@@ ally dis@@ appe@@ ar ."
What I saw was my teach@@ ers coming through me .
"I saw my ge@@ omet@@ ry teach@@ er in high school , M@@ r@@ . R@@ u@@ cell &apos;s w@@ ry sm@@ ile under his han@@ d@@ le@@ b@@ ar mu@@ sta@@ ch@@ e ."
That &apos;s the sm@@ ile I use — that &apos;s his sm@@ ile .
I saw J@@ an P@@ ol@@ o &apos;s f@@ la@@ sh@@ ing eyes .
"And they wer@@ en &apos;t f@@ la@@ sh@@ ing in an@@ ger , they were f@@ la@@ sh@@ ing in love , in@@ ten@@ se love for her students ."
And I have that kind of fl@@ ash sometimes .
And I saw M@@ is@@ s E@@ the@@ l J@@ . B@@ an@@ ks who wor@@ e pe@@ ar@@ ls and high@@ -@@ he@@ els to ele@@ men@@ t@@ ary school every day .
"And you know , she had that ol@@ d-@@ school teach@@ er st@@ are ."
You know the one .
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that teach@@ er ?"
"I didn &apos;t use that st@@ are very often , but I do have it in my re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re ."
And M@@ is@@ s B@@ an@@ ks was there as a great men@@ tor for me .
"And then I saw my own parents , my first teach@@ ers ."
"My father , very inv@@ enti@@ ve , sp@@ ati@@ al thin@@ k@@ er ."
That &apos;s my bro@@ ther M@@ al@@ col@@ m there on the right .
"And my mother , who ta@@ u@@ ght me in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de in se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated scho@@ ols in V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , who was my in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation ."
"And really , I feel as though , when I see the fil@@ m — I have a g@@ est@@ ure she does , like this — I feel like I am a contin@@ u@@ ation of her g@@ est@@ ure ."
I am one of her teach@@ ing g@@ est@@ ures .
"And the beautiful thing was , I got to te@@ ach my d@@ aughter in ele@@ men@@ t@@ ary school , Ma@@ del@@ ine ."
And so that g@@ est@@ ure of my mother &apos;s contin@@ ues through many gener@@ ations .
It &apos;s an amazing feel@@ ing to have that lin@@ e@@ age .
And so I &apos;m here standing on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders of many people .
I &apos;m not here alone .
There are many people on this stage right now .
And so this Wor@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace G@@ ame I &apos;d like to tell you about .
"It started out like this : it &apos;s just a f@@ our@@ -@@ fo@@ ot by fi@@ ve@@ -@@ fo@@ ot pl@@ y@@ wo@@ od bo@@ ard in an in@@ ner@@ -@@ city ur@@ b@@ an school , 19@@ 7@@ 8 ."
I was cre@@ ating a les@@ son for students on Africa .
"We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them sol@@ ve it ."
I didn &apos;t want to le@@ c@@ ture or have just book read@@ ing .
I wanted to have them be im@@ mer@@ sed and learn the feel@@ ing of learning through their bod@@ ies .
"So I thought , well they like to play g@@ am@@ es ."
I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say inter@@ ac@@ tive ; we didn &apos;t have that ter@@ m in 19@@ 7@@ 8 — but something inter@@ ac@@ tive .
"And so we made the game , and it has since evol@@ ved to a f@@ our@@ -@@ fo@@ ot by f@@ our@@ -@@ fo@@ ot by f@@ our@@ -@@ fo@@ ot P@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ glas@@ s structure ."
And it has four P@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ glas@@ s la@@ y@@ ers .
There &apos;s an ou@@ ter space la@@ y@@ er with black hol@@ es and s@@ atel@@ lit@@ es and research s@@ atel@@ lit@@ es and ast@@ er@@ o@@ id min@@ ing .
"There &apos;s an air and space level with cl@@ ou@@ ds that are big pu@@ ff@@ s of c@@ ot@@ ton we pus@@ h around and ter@@ rit@@ ori@@ al air sp@@ ac@@ es and air for@@ ces , a ground and se@@ a level with thousands of game pi@@ ec@@ es on it — even an under@@ se@@ a level with sub@@ mar@@ ines and under@@ se@@ a min@@ ing ."
There are four countries around the bo@@ ard .
The kids make up the na@@ m@@ es of the countries — some are ri@@ ch ; some are po@@ or .
"They have different as@@ s@@ ets , com@@ mer@@ cial and mil@@ it@@ ary ."
And each country has a c@@ ab@@ in@@ et .
"There &apos;s a Pri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er , S@@ ec@@ ret@@ ary of S@@ t@@ ate , M@@ in@@ ist@@ er of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se and a C@@ F@@ O , or C@@ om@@ p@@ tro@@ l@@ l@@ er ."
I cho@@ ose the Pri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er based on my relation@@ ship with them .
"I off@@ er them the job , they can turn it down , and then they cho@@ ose their own c@@ ab@@ in@@ et ."
"There &apos;s a Wor@@ ld B@@ ank , ar@@ ms de@@ al@@ ers and a United N@@ ations ."
There &apos;s also a we@@ a@@ ther god@@ d@@ ess who contro@@ ls a ran@@ dom sto@@ ck market and ran@@ dom we@@ a@@ ther .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
And then there &apos;s a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ p@@ age cri@@ s@@ is do@@ cu@@ ment with 50 inter@@ lo@@ c@@ king problems .
"So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes ."
"I th@@ row them into this complex mat@@ ri@@ x , and they tru@@ st me because we have a de@@ ep , ri@@ ch relation@@ ship together ."
"And so with all these cri@@ ses , we have — let &apos;s see — e@@ th@@ ni@@ c and min@@ or@@ ity ten@@ sions ; we have chem@@ ical and nu@@ clear sp@@ ill@@ s , nu@@ clear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s oil sp@@ ill@@ s , environ@@ mental dis@@ ast@@ ers , water ri@@ ghts dis@@ put@@ es , bre@@ a@@ ka@@ way re@@ publi@@ cs , fam@@ ine , en@@ dan@@ ger@@ ed species and global war@@ ming ."
"If A@@ l G@@ ore is here , I &apos;m going to sen@@ d my f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders from A@@ g@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t and V@@ en@@ able scho@@ ols to you because they sol@@ ved global war@@ ming in a week ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it sever@@ al times too . ( Laughter )
"So I also have in the game a s@@ ab@@ ot@@ e@@ ur — some child — it &apos;s basically a t@@ rou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er — and I have my t@@ rou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to s@@ ave the world and their pos@@ ition in the game ."
But they &apos;re also trying to under@@ m@@ ine everything in the game .
"And they do it se@@ cre@@ tly through mis@@ information and am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ities and ir@@ re@@ lev@@ an@@ ci@@ es , trying to c@@ ause everyone to think more de@@ e@@ ply ."
"The s@@ ab@@ ot@@ e@@ ur is there , and we also read from Su@@ n T@@ z@@ u &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Ar@@ t of W@@ ar . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders understand it — n@@ ine years old — and they han@@ dle that and use that to understand how to , not fol@@ low — at first they do — the pa@@ ths to power and dest@@ ru@@ ction , the pat@@ h to war ."
"They learn to over@@ look shor@@ t-@@ si@@ gh@@ ted re@@ ac@@ tions and im@@ pul@@ sive thinking , to think in a lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m , more con@@ sequ@@ ential way ."
"S@@ te@@ war@@ t B@@ r@@ and is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a C@@ o@@ E@@ vol@@ ution Q@@ u@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly arti@@ cle on a pe@@ ace for@@ ce ."
"And in the game , sometimes students actually form a pe@@ ace for@@ ce ."
I &apos;m just a clo@@ ck wat@@ ch@@ er .
I &apos;m just a cl@@ ari@@ fi@@ er . I &apos;m just a fac@@ il@@ it@@ ator .
The students run the game .
I have no chan@@ ce to make any po@@ lic@@ y what@@ so@@ ever once they start pla@@ ying .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
( V@@ ideo ) Bo@@ y : The Wor@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace G@@ ame is seri@@ ous .
You &apos;re actually getting ta@@ u@@ ght something like how to take care of the world .
"S@@ ee , M@@ r@@ . H@@ un@@ ter is doing that because he says his time has m@@ ess@@ ed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fi@@ x that problem ."
"@@ J@@ oh@@ n H@@ un@@ ter : I off@@ er@@ ed them a — ( Applause ) A@@ c@@ tually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer ."
And I ad@@ m@@ it the tru@@ th to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
"And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to di@@ g up the answer ."
And so I a@@ polo@@ g@@ ize to them as well .
"I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sor@@ ry , bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls , but the tru@@ th is we have left this world to you in such a sa@@ d and ter@@ ri@@ ble sh@@ ape , and we hope you can fi@@ x it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sin@@ c@@ ere a@@ polo@@ gy , and they take it very seri@@ ously ."
Now you may be wonder@@ ing what all this compl@@ ex@@ ity looks like .
"Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see ."
"( V@@ ideo ) J@@ H : All right , we &apos;re going into ne@@ got@@ i@@ ations as of now . G@@ o ."
"( Ch@@ at@@ ter ) J@@ H : My question to you is , who &apos;s in ch@@ ar@@ ge of that clas@@ s@@ room ?"
It &apos;s a seri@@ ous question : who is really in ch@@ ar@@ ge ?
I &apos;ve learned to c@@ e@@ de control of the clas@@ s@@ room over to the students over time .
There &apos;s a tru@@ st and an under@@ standing and a de@@ di@@ c@@ ation to an ide@@ al that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teach@@ er : control every con@@ vers@@ ation and respon@@ se in the clas@@ s@@ room .
"It &apos;s im@@ possible . Th@@ e@@ ir colle@@ ctive w@@ is@@ dom is much gre@@ ater than m@@ ine , and I ad@@ m@@ it it to them op@@ en@@ ly ."
So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some mag@@ ical things that have happened .
"In this game we had a little girl , and she was the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ ist@@ er of the po@@ ore@@ st n@@ ation ."
And the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ ist@@ er — she had the t@@ ank cor@@ ps and A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce and so for@@ th .
"And she was next do@@ or to a very we@@ al@@ thy , o@@ il@@ -@@ ri@@ ch ne@@ igh@@ bor ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ out pro@@ vo@@ c@@ ation , sud@@ den@@ ly she atta@@ c@@ ked , against her Pri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er &apos;s or@@ ders , the ne@@ x@@ t-@@ do@@ or ne@@ igh@@ bor &apos;s oil fiel@@ ds ."
"S@@ he mar@@ ched into the oil fiel@@ d re@@ ser@@ ves , sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded it , without fi@@ r@@ ing a sh@@ ot , and se@@ cu@@ red it and hel@@ d it ."
And that ne@@ igh@@ bor was u@@ na@@ ble to con@@ duc@@ t any mil@@ it@@ ary oper@@ ations because their fu@@ el sup@@ ply was lo@@ c@@ ked up .
"We were all up@@ set with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?"
"This is the Wor@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace G@@ ame . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at n@@ ine years old , she hel@@ d her pi@@ ec@@ es and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; T@@ o her gir@@ l@@ friends she said that ."
That &apos;s a bre@@ ach there .
"And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to c@@ ross a n@@ ine year@@ -@@ old girl with tan@@ ks ."
( Laughter ) They are the tou@@ gh@@ est op@@ pon@@ ents .
And we were very up@@ set .
I thought I was fa@@ il@@ ing as a teach@@ er . Why would she do this ?
"But come to find out , a few game days later — and there are turns where we take ne@@ got@@ i@@ ation from a team — actually there &apos;s a ne@@ got@@ i@@ ation period with all te@@ am@@ s , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in ne@@ got@@ i@@ ation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day ."
So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this maj@@ or country was plan@@ ning a mil@@ it@@ ary off@@ en@@ sive to dom@@ in@@ ate the entire world .
"H@@ ad they had their fu@@ el su@@ pp@@ li@@ es , they would have done it ."
She was able to see the v@@ ec@@ tors and tr@@ end lin@@ es and in@@ t@@ enti@@ ons long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a ph@@ il@@ oso@@ ph@@ ical deci@@ sion to atta@@ ck in a pe@@ ace game .
"Now she used a small war to aver@@ t a lar@@ ger war , so we sto@@ pped and had a very good ph@@ il@@ oso@@ ph@@ ical disc@@ us@@ sion about whether that was right , cond@@ iti@@ onal good , or not right ."
"That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situ@@ ations ."
I could not have desig@@ ned that in teach@@ ing it .
It came about s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously through their colle@@ ctive w@@ is@@ dom .
"( Applause ) A@@ no@@ ther example , a beautiful thing happened ."
We have a let@@ ter in the game .
"If you &apos;re a mil@@ it@@ ary com@@ man@@ der and you w@@ age tro@@ op@@ s — the little plast@@ ic to@@ ys on the bo@@ ard — and you lo@@ se them , I put in a let@@ ter ."
You have to write a let@@ ter to their parents — the fic@@ ti@@ onal parents of your fic@@ ti@@ onal tro@@ op@@ s — expla@@ ining what happened and off@@ ering your con@@ dol@@ ences .
So you have a little bit more thought before you comm@@ it to com@@ b@@ at .
"And so we had this situ@@ ation come up — last sum@@ mer actually , at A@@ g@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t S@@ cho@@ ol in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty — and one of our mil@@ it@@ ary com@@ man@@ ders got up to read that let@@ ter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; M@@ r@@ . H@@ un@@ ter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a par@@ ent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a par@@ ent vis@@ iting that day , just sit@@ ting in the back of the room ."
&quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the let@@ ter .
"It &apos;ll be more re@@ al@@ er if she re@@ ads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she g@@ am@@ ely pic@@ ked up the let@@ ter ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ ure . &quot; &quot; She started read@@ ing . She read one sent@@ ence .
She read two sent@@ ences .
"B@@ y the third sent@@ ence , she was in te@@ ar@@ s ."
I was in te@@ ar@@ s .
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body under@@ sto@@ od that when we lo@@ se somebody , the win@@ n@@ ers are not g@@ lo@@ ating ."
We all lo@@ se .
And it was an amazing oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ence and an amazing under@@ standing .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend Dav@@ id says about this .
He &apos;s been in many bat@@ t@@ les .
( V@@ ideo ) Dav@@ id : We &apos;ve really had enough of people atta@@ c@@ king .
"I mean , we &apos;ve been lu@@ ck@@ y &#91; most of &#93; the time ."
But now I &apos;m feel@@ ing really we@@ ird because I &apos;m living what Su@@ n T@@ z@@ u said one week .
"One week he said , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose who go into bat@@ tle and w@@ in will want to go back , and those who lo@@ se in bat@@ tle will want to go back and w@@ in . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been win@@ ning bat@@ t@@ les , so I &apos;m going into bat@@ t@@ les , more bat@@ t@@ les ."
And I think it &apos;s sort of we@@ ird to be living what Su@@ n T@@ z@@ u said .
J@@ H : I get ch@@ ill@@ s every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of eng@@ ag@@ ement you want to have happen .
"And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that ."
But it &apos;s self-@@ evid@@ ent as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment .
We know that &apos;s an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of learning .
"We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go be@@ y@@ ond data with the real tru@@ th of what &apos;s going on ."
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend B@@ ren@@ na@@ n .
"We had pla@@ yed the game one s@@ es@@ sion after school for many we@@ eks , about se@@ ven we@@ eks , and we had es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally sol@@ ved all 50 of the inter@@ lo@@ c@@ king cri@@ ses ."
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be sol@@ ved and every country &apos;s as@@ set val@@ ue has to be incre@@ as@@ ed ab@@ ov@@ e its star@@ ting point .
"S@@ ome are po@@ or , some are we@@ al@@ thy . There are bil@@ li@@ ons ."
The Wor@@ ld B@@ ank pre@@ sid@@ ent was a th@@ ir@@ d-@@ gra@@ der one time .
"He says , &quot; &quot; How many zer@@ os in a tr@@ il@@ lion ? I &apos;ve got to cal@@ cul@@ ate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was set@@ ting f@@ is@@ cal po@@ lic@@ y in that game for high school pla@@ y@@ ers who were pla@@ ying with him ."
So the team that was the po@@ ore@@ st had got@@ ten even po@@ ore@@ r .
There was no way they could w@@ in .
"And we were appro@@ ach@@ ing four o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck , our c@@ ut@@ -@@ off time — there was about a minut@@ e left — and des@@ pa@@ ir just set@@ t@@ led over the room ."
"I thought , I &apos;m fa@@ il@@ ing as a teach@@ er ."
I should have got@@ ten it so they could have won .
They sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be fa@@ il@@ ing like this .
I &apos;ve fa@@ il@@ ed them .
And I was just feel@@ ing so sa@@ d and de@@ j@@ ec@@ ted .
"And sud@@ den@@ ly , B@@ ren@@ na@@ n wal@@ ked over to my cha@@ ir and he gra@@ b@@ bed the b@@ ell , the b@@ ell I r@@ ing to sig@@ nal a change or a re@@ con@@ ven@@ ing of c@@ ab@@ in@@ ets , and he ran back to his se@@ at , ran@@ g the b@@ ell ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body ran to his cha@@ ir : there was scre@@ am@@ ing ; there was y@@ ell@@ ing , w@@ av@@ ing of their do@@ s@@ si@@ ers ."
They get these do@@ s@@ si@@ ers full of se@@ cre@@ t do@@ cu@@ ments .
They were g@@ est@@ icul@@ ating ; they were ru@@ n@@ ning around .
I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my clas@@ s@@ room .
"P@@ rin@@ ci@@ p@@ al wal@@ ks in , I &apos;m out of a job ."
The parents were looking in the win@@ do@@ w .
And B@@ ren@@ na@@ n ru@@ ns back to his se@@ at . E@@ ver@@ y@@ body ru@@ ns back to their se@@ at .
"He r@@ ings the b@@ ell again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 secon@@ ds left on the clo@@ ck — &quot; &quot; we have , all n@@ ations , po@@ ol@@ ed all our fun@@ ds together ."
And we &apos;ve got 6@@ 00 billion dollars .
We &apos;re going to off@@ er it as a don@@ ation to this po@@ or country .
"And if they acc@@ ept it , it &apos;ll ra@@ ise their as@@ set val@@ ue and we can w@@ in the game ."
W@@ ill you acc@@ ept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three secon@@ ds left on the clo@@ ck .
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body looks at this pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; And the game is won ."
"S@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous comp@@ as@@ sion that could not be plan@@ ned for , that was u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted and un@@ predi@@ c@@ table ."
E@@ very game we play is different .
"S@@ ome g@@ am@@ es are more about social issu@@ es , some are more about economic issu@@ es ."
S@@ ome g@@ am@@ es are more about war@@ f@@ are .
But I don &apos;t try to d@@ eny them that reality of being human .
"I al@@ low them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a blo@@ od@@ less way , how not to do what they consi@@ der to be the wrong thing ."
"And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves ."
"And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pic@@ k up a c@@ rit@@ ical thinking to@@ ol or cre@@ ative thinking to@@ ol from this game and le@@ ver@@ age something good for the world , they may s@@ ave us all ."
If only .
"And on be@@ half of all of my teach@@ ers on wh@@ ose sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders I &apos;m standing , th@@ ank you . Thank you . Thank you ."
( Applause )
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small to@@ wn ki@@ d .
"I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story ."
He lives in a small v@@ ill@@ age in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ om@@ ali@@ a .
H@@ is v@@ ill@@ age is ne@@ ar M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
D@@ rou@@ ght dri@@ ves the small v@@ ill@@ age into pover@@ ty and to the br@@ in@@ k of star@@ v@@ ation .
"W@@ ith nothing left for him there , he le@@ av@@ es for the big city , in this case , M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u , the cap@@ ital of S@@ om@@ ali@@ a ."
"When he ar@@ ri@@ ves , there are no opport@@ unities , no j@@ ob@@ s , no way for@@ ward ."
He ends up living in a t@@ ent city on the ou@@ ts@@ ki@@ r@@ ts of M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
"M@@ a@@ ybe a year pas@@ ses , nothing ."
"One day , he &apos;s appro@@ ach@@ ed by a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man who off@@ ers to take him to l@@ un@@ ch , then to din@@ ner , to bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast ."
"He me@@ ets this dy@@ na@@ mic group of people , and they give him a bre@@ ak ."
"He &apos;s given a bit of money to bu@@ y him@@ self some new clo@@ th@@ es , money to sen@@ d back home to his family ."
He is in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed to this young woman .
He ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally gets mar@@ ri@@ ed .
He star@@ ts this new life .
He has a pur@@ pose in life .
"One beautiful day in M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u , under an az@@ ure bl@@ ue sk@@ y , a car b@@ om@@ b goes off ."
"That small to@@ wn ki@@ d with the big city dre@@ am@@ s was the su@@ ici@@ de b@@ om@@ ber , and that dy@@ na@@ mic group of people were al Sh@@ ab@@ a@@ a@@ b , a ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ st organiz@@ ation lin@@ ked to al Q@@ a@@ e@@ da ."
So how does the story of a small to@@ wn ki@@ d just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blo@@ wing him@@ self up ?
He was wa@@ iting .
"He was wa@@ iting for an opport@@ unity , wa@@ iting to beg@@ in his future , wa@@ iting for a way for@@ ward , and this was the first thing that came along ."
This was the first thing that pul@@ led him out of what we call wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od .
And his story re@@ pe@@ ats itself in ur@@ b@@ an c@@ en@@ ters around the world .
"It is the story of the dis@@ en@@ f@@ ran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed , u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ yed ur@@ b@@ an y@@ outh who sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ ots in J@@ o@@ han@@ nes@@ bur@@ g , sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ ots in Lon@@ don , who re@@ ach@@ es out for something other than wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od ."
"For young people , the pro@@ mi@@ se of the city , the big city dre@@ am is that of opport@@ unity , of j@@ ob@@ s , of we@@ al@@ th , but young people are not shar@@ ing in the pros@@ per@@ ity of their cities ."
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s y@@ outh who su@@ ff@@ er from the high@@ est u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment rat@@ es .
"B@@ y 20@@ 30 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 ."
"If we do not inclu@@ de young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not pro@@ vide them opport@@ unities , the story of wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od , the g@@ at@@ e@@ way to ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m , to viol@@ ence , to gan@@ gs , will be the story of cities 2@@ .@@ 0 ."
"And in my city of bir@@ th , M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u , 70 percent of young people su@@ ff@@ er from u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment ."
"@@ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school ."
They pretty much do nothing .
"I went back to M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u last mon@@ th , and I went to vi@@ sit M@@ ad@@ ina H@@ os@@ pit@@ al , the hosp@@ ital I was born in ."
"I remember standing in front of that bu@@ l@@ let@@ -@@ ri@@ d@@ den hosp@@ ital thinking , what if I had never left ?"
What if I had been for@@ ced into that same state of wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od ?
W@@ ould I have become a ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ st ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
My reason for being in M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u that mon@@ th was actually to ho@@ st a y@@ outh lea@@ der@@ ship and ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ ship sum@@ m@@ it .
I b@@ rou@@ ght together about 9@@ 0 young S@@ om@@ ali lea@@ ders .
We s@@ at down and bra@@ inst@@ or@@ med on sol@@ utions to the bi@@ gg@@ est chall@@ eng@@ es fac@@ ing their city .
One of the young men in the room was A@@ den .
"He went to univers@@ ity in M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u , gradu@@ ated ."
"There were no j@@ ob@@ s , no opport@@ unities ."
"I remember him telling me , because he was a colle@@ ge gradu@@ ate , u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ yed , f@@ ru@@ strat@@ ed , that he was the perf@@ ect tar@@ get for al Sh@@ ab@@ a@@ a@@ b and other ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ st organiz@@ ations , to be rec@@ ru@@ ited ."
They s@@ ou@@ ght people like him out .
But his story takes a different ro@@ ute .
"In M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u , the bi@@ gg@@ est bar@@ ri@@ er to getting from point A to point B are the ro@@ ads ."
"T@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ three years of ci@@ vil war have completely dest@@ ro@@ yed the ro@@ ad system , and a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke can be the e@@ a@@ si@@ est way to get around ."
A@@ den saw an opport@@ unity and se@@ iz@@ ed it .
He started a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke company .
He beg@@ an r@@ ent@@ ing out mot@@ or@@ bi@@ k@@ es to local re@@ sid@@ ents who couldn &apos;t norm@@ ally af@@ for@@ d them .
"He b@@ ou@@ ght 10 bi@@ k@@ es , with the help of family and friends , and his dre@@ am is to ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally ex@@ p@@ and to sever@@ al hun@@ d@@ red within the next three years ."
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to id@@ enti@@ fy and se@@ ize a new opport@@ unity .
"It &apos;s ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ ship , and I believe ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ ship can be the most powerful to@@ ol against wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od ."
It em@@ po@@ wers young people to be the cre@@ at@@ ors of the very economic opport@@ unities they are so des@@ per@@ ately se@@ ek@@ ing .
And you can tra@@ in young people to be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s .
"I want to talk to you about a young man who atten@@ ded one of my me@@ et@@ ings , Mo@@ h@@ am@@ ed Mo@@ h@@ am@@ ou@@ d , a fl@@ or@@ ist ."
He was hel@@ ping me tra@@ in some of the young people at the sum@@ m@@ it in ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ ship and how to be innov@@ ative and how to create a culture of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ ship .
"He &apos;s actually the first fl@@ or@@ ist M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u has seen in over 2@@ 2 years , and until rec@@ ently , until Mo@@ h@@ am@@ ed came along , if you wanted flo@@ wers at your w@@ ed@@ ding , you used plast@@ ic b@@ ou@@ qu@@ ets shi@@ pped from ab@@ ro@@ ad ."
"If you asked someone , &quot; Wh@@ en was the last time you saw f@@ res@@ h flo@@ wers ? &quot;"
"@@ for many who gre@@ w up under ci@@ vil war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever . &quot; &quot; So Mo@@ h@@ am@@ ed saw an opport@@ unity ."
He started a lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ ing and design fl@@ or@@ al company .
"He created a far@@ m right outside of M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u , and started gro@@ wing tu@@ li@@ ps and l@@ ili@@ es , which he said could survi@@ ve the har@@ sh M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u clim@@ ate ."
"And he beg@@ an deli@@ ver@@ ing flo@@ wers to w@@ ed@@ din@@ gs , cre@@ ating gar@@ den@@ s at hom@@ es and busin@@ ess@@ es around the city , and he &apos;s now working on cre@@ ating M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u &apos;s first public par@@ k in 2@@ 2 years ."
There &apos;s no public par@@ k in M@@ og@@ a@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
"He wan@@ ts to create a space where famili@@ es , young people , can come together , and , as he says , sm@@ ell the prover@@ bi@@ al ros@@ es ."
"And he doesn &apos;t grow ros@@ es because they use too much water , by the way ."
"So the first step is to in@@ spi@@ re young people , and in that room , Mo@@ h@@ am@@ ed &apos;s pres@@ ence had a really pro@@ found imp@@ act on the y@@ outh in that room ."
They had never really thought about star@@ ting up a business .
"They &apos;ve thought about working for an N@@ G@@ O , working for the government , but his story , his innov@@ ation , really had a stron@@ g imp@@ act on them ."
He for@@ ced them to look at their city as a place of opport@@ unity .
"He em@@ power@@ ed them to believe that they could be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s , that they could be change mak@@ ers ."
"B@@ y the end of the day , they were coming up with innov@@ ative sol@@ utions to some of the bi@@ gg@@ est chall@@ eng@@ es fac@@ ing their city ."
They came up with ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ u@@ ri@@ al sol@@ utions to local problems .
"So in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing young people and cre@@ ating a culture of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ ship is a really great step , but young people need cap@@ ital to make their ideas a reality ."
They need ex@@ per@@ ti@@ se and men@@ tor@@ ship to gu@@ i@@ de them in develop@@ ing and lau@@ n@@ ching their busin@@ ess@@ es .
"C@@ on@@ ne@@ ct young people with the resour@@ ces they need , pro@@ vide them the sup@@ port they need to go from ide@@ ation to cre@@ ation , and you will create cat@@ al@@ y@@ sts for ur@@ b@@ an growth ."
"For me , ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ ship is more than just star@@ ting up a business ."
It &apos;s about cre@@ ating a social imp@@ act .
Mo@@ h@@ am@@ ed is not simply sel@@ ling flo@@ wers .
I believe he is sel@@ ling hope .
"H@@ is P@@ e@@ ace Par@@ k , and that &apos;s what he call@@ s it , when it &apos;s created , will actually trans@@ form the way people see their city ."
A@@ den hi@@ red stre@@ et kids to help r@@ ent out and ma@@ in@@ tain those bi@@ k@@ es for him .
He gave them the opport@@ unity to es@@ cap@@ e the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is of wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od .
These young ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s are having a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous imp@@ act in their cities .
"So my su@@ gg@@ esti@@ on is , turn y@@ outh into ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s , in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate and n@@ ur@@ ture their in@@ her@@ ent innov@@ ation , and you will have more stories of flo@@ wers and P@@ e@@ ace Par@@ ks than of car b@@ om@@ b@@ s and wa@@ i@@ th@@ o@@ od ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"O@@ kay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play ."
I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
I didn &apos;t realiz@@ e there was going to be a little music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
"( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause ) O@@ kay , so first of all , let &apos;s w@@ el@@ come M@@ r@@ . J@@ am@@ i@@ re W@@ illi@@ am@@ s on the dru@@ ms , ( Applause ) B@@ ur@@ n@@ is@@ s T@@ rav@@ is on the bas@@ s , ( Applause ) and M@@ r@@ . Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an S@@ an@@ ds on the pi@@ ano . ( Applause )"
"So the ban@@ d@@ stand , as we call it , this is an incredi@@ ble space ."
It is really a s@@ ac@@ red space .
"And one of the things that is really s@@ ac@@ red about it is that you have no opport@@ unity to think about the future , or the past ."
You really are ali@@ ve right here in this moment .
There are so many deci@@ sions being made when you walk on the ban@@ d@@ stand .
We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
"In the middle , we sort of made our way into a s@@ ong called &quot; &quot; T@@ it@@ i Bo@@ om . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one &apos;s list@@ ening . We &apos;re respon@@ ding .
You have no time for pro@@ jec@@ ted ideas .
"So the idea of a mi@@ sta@@ ke : F@@ rom the perspe@@ ctive of a jaz@@ z mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an , it &apos;s e@@ a@@ si@@ er to talk about someone else &apos;s mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
"So the way I perc@@ ei@@ ve a mi@@ sta@@ ke when I &apos;m on the ban@@ d@@ stand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
The only mi@@ sta@@ ke li@@ es in that I &apos;m not able to perc@@ ei@@ ve what it is that someone else did .
E@@ very &quot; &quot; mi@@ sta@@ ke &quot; &quot; is an opport@@ unity in jaz@@ z .
So it &apos;s hard to even descri@@ be what a fun@@ ny not@@ e would be .
"So for example , if I pla@@ yed a col@@ or , like we were pla@@ ying on a pal@@ et@@ te , that s@@ oun@@ ded like this ..@@ ."
( Mu@@ sic ) So if Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an pla@@ yed a not@@ e — like play an F@@ . ( Mu@@ sic )
"S@@ ee , these are all right inside of the col@@ or pal@@ et@@ te ."
If you pla@@ yed an E@@ .
"S@@ ee , these all li@@ e right inside of this gener@@ al emot@@ i@@ onal pal@@ et@@ te that we were pain@@ ting ."
"If you pla@@ yed an F # though , ( D@@ is@@ s@@ on@@ ance ) to most people &apos;s ear@@ s , they would perc@@ ei@@ ve that as a mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
"So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second ."
And we &apos;re going to play on this pal@@ et@@ te .
"And at some point , Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an will in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce this not@@ e ."
And we won &apos;t re@@ act to it .
"He &apos;ll in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second ."
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this pal@@ et@@ te .
( Mu@@ sic ) So someone could conc@@ ep@@ tually perc@@ ei@@ ve that as a mi@@ sta@@ ke .
The only way that I would say it was a mi@@ sta@@ ke is in that we didn &apos;t re@@ act to it .
It was an opport@@ unity that was mis@@ sed .
So it &apos;s un@@ predi@@ c@@ table . We &apos;ll pain@@ t this pal@@ et@@ te again .
"He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll re@@ act to it , but something will change ."
"We &apos;ll all acc@@ ept his ideas , or not ."
"( Mu@@ sic ) So you see , he pla@@ yed this not@@ e ."
I en@@ ded up cre@@ ating a mel@@ ody out of it .
The te@@ x@@ ture changed in the dru@@ ms this time .
"It got a little bit more r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic , a little bit more in@@ ten@@ se in respon@@ se to how I respon@@ ded to it ."
So there is no mi@@ sta@@ ke .
"The only mi@@ sta@@ ke is if I &apos;m not aw@@ are , if each individu@@ al mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an is not aw@@ are and acc@@ ep@@ ting enough of his fel@@ low b@@ and mem@@ ber to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate the idea and we don &apos;t al@@ low for cre@@ ativ@@ ity ."
"So jaz@@ z , this ban@@ d@@ stand is absol@@ ut@@ ely amazing ."
It &apos;s a very pu@@ ri@@ f@@ ying experience .
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for gran@@ ted .
We know that to be able to come on the ban@@ d@@ stand and play music is a bl@@ ess@@ ing .
So how does this all rel@@ ate to behavi@@ or@@ al fin@@ ance ?
"Well we &apos;re jaz@@ z mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans , so st@@ ere@@ ot@@ y@@ pic@@ ally we don &apos;t have a great relation@@ ship to fin@@ ance ."
"( Laughter ) A@@ ny@@ way , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we han@@ dle it ."
And the other dy@@ na@@ mic of it is that we don &apos;t micro@@ man@@ age in jaz@@ z .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually lim@@ its the arti@@ st@@ ic pos@@ sibil@@ ities .
"If I come up and I di@@ c@@ t@@ ate to the b@@ and that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just ju@@ m@@ p right in ..@@ ."
"@@ ready , just play some time ."
"One , two , one , two , three , four ."
( Mu@@ sic ) It &apos;s kind of cha@@ ot@@ ic because I &apos;m bu@@ l@@ l@@ ying my ideas .
"I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to list@@ en ."
This is a science of list@@ ening .
It has far more to do with what I can perc@@ ei@@ ve than what it is that I can do .
"So if I want the music to get to a certain level of in@@ ten@@ s@@ ity , the first step for me is to be pati@@ ent , to list@@ en to what &apos;s going on and pul@@ l from something that &apos;s going on around me ."
"When you do that , you eng@@ age and in@@ spi@@ re the other mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans and they give you more , and gradu@@ ally it buil@@ ds ."
"W@@ at@@ ch . One , two , a one , two , three , four ."
( Mu@@ sic ) T@@ ot@@ ally different experience when I &apos;m pul@@ ling ideas .
It &apos;s much more org@@ ani@@ c . It &apos;s much more nu@@ an@@ ced .
It &apos;s not about bu@@ l@@ l@@ ying my vision or anything like that .
"It &apos;s about being here in the moment , acc@@ ep@@ ting one another and allo@@ wing cre@@ ativ@@ ity to f@@ low ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real chall@@ eng@@ es is to innov@@ ate fundam@@ ent@@ ally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ th@@ r@@ all@@ ed to in education ."
This one teach@@ er didn &apos;t take it seri@@ ously .
"I want to say that really and tru@@ ly , after these incredi@@ ble spe@@ ech@@ es and ideas that are being s@@ pre@@ ad , I am in the aw@@ k@@ ward pos@@ ition of being here to talk to you today about tele@@ vision ."
So most everyone wat@@ ch@@ es T@@ V .
We like it . We like some parts of it .
"H@@ ere in America , people actually love T@@ V ."
The aver@@ age American wat@@ ch@@ es T@@ V for almost 5 hours a day .
O@@ kay ?
"Now I happen to make my living these days in tele@@ vision , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing ."
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
"They , in fact , ber@@ ate it ."
"They call it stup@@ id , and wor@@ se , believe me ."
"My mother , gro@@ wing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; i@@ di@@ ot bo@@ x . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to de@@ b@@ ate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good T@@ V or bad T@@ V ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe tele@@ vision has a con@@ science ."
"So why I believe that tele@@ vision has a con@@ science is that I actually believe that tele@@ vision direc@@ tly re@@ fle@@ c@@ ts the mor@@ al , polit@@ ical , social and emot@@ i@@ onal need stat@@ es of our n@@ ation — that tele@@ vision is how we actually dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate our entire val@@ ue system ."
"So all these things are uni@@ qu@@ ely human , and they all ad@@ d up to our idea of con@@ science ."
"Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad T@@ V ."
We &apos;re talking about popul@@ ar T@@ V .
We &apos;re talking about to@@ p@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ rat@@ ed shows over the course of 50 years .
"H@@ ow do these N@@ i@@ el@@ se@@ n rat@@ ings re@@ fle@@ ct not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , colle@@ ctive un@@ consci@@ ous , but how do these to@@ p@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ rat@@ ed shows over 50 years re@@ fle@@ ct the idea of our social con@@ science ?"
"H@@ ow does tele@@ vision evol@@ ve over time , and what does this say about our society ?"
"Now spe@@ a@@ king of evol@@ ution , from ba@@ sic biolog@@ y , you probably remember that the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom , inclu@@ ding humans , have four ba@@ sic pri@@ m@@ al inst@@ in@@ c@@ ts ."
You have hun@@ ger ; you have se@@ x ; you have power ; and you have the ur@@ ge for ac@@ qu@@ is@@ iti@@ ven@@ ess .
"As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve develop@@ ed , we &apos;ve evol@@ ved over time to tem@@ per , or ta@@ me , these ba@@ sic anim@@ al inst@@ in@@ c@@ ts ."
We have the cap@@ ac@@ ity to lau@@ gh and c@@ ry .
"We feel a@@ we , we feel p@@ ity ."
That is se@@ par@@ ate and a@@ part from the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom .
The other thing about human be@@ ings is that we love to be en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ined .
We love to wat@@ ch T@@ V .
This is something that c@@ lear@@ ly se@@ par@@ ates us from the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom .
"A@@ nim@@ als might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to wat@@ ch ."
So I had an am@@ b@@ ition to disc@@ over what could be under@@ sto@@ od from this uni@@ qu@@ ely human relation@@ ship between tele@@ vision progra@@ ms and the human consci@@ ous .
Why has tele@@ vision en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment evol@@ ved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this car@@ to@@ on de@@ vil or ang@@ el sit@@ ting on our sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders .
"I@@ s tele@@ vision liter@@ ally fun@@ cti@@ on@@ ing as our con@@ science , tem@@ p@@ ting us and re@@ war@@ ding us at the same time ?"
"So to beg@@ in to answer these questions , we did a research study ."
We went back 50 years to the 19@@ 5@@ 9 / 19@@ 60 tele@@ vision se@@ as@@ on .
We sur@@ ve@@ yed the to@@ p@@ -@@ 20 N@@ i@@ el@@ se@@ n shows every year for 50 years — a thou@@ s@@ and shows .
"We tal@@ ked to over 3@@ ,000 individu@@ als — almost 3@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 — ag@@ ed 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emot@@ i@@ on@@ ally ."
How did you feel wat@@ ching every single one of these shows ?
D@@ id you feel a sense of mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity ?
D@@ id you feel ou@@ tra@@ ge ? D@@ id you lau@@ gh ?
What did this mean for you ?
"So to our global TED audi@@ ences , I want to say that this was a U.@@ S. sam@@ ple ."
"But as you can see , these emot@@ i@@ onal need stat@@ es are tru@@ ly univers@@ al ."
"And on a fac@@ tual bas@@ is , over 80 percent of the U.@@ S. &apos; s most popul@@ ar shows are ex@@ por@@ ted around the world ."
So I really hope our global audi@@ ences can rel@@ ate .
"T@@ w@@ o ac@@ knowled@@ g@@ ments before our first data sli@@ de : F@@ or in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing me to even think about the idea of con@@ science and the tri@@ cks that con@@ science can play on us on a da@@ ily bas@@ is , I th@@ ank le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary rab@@ b@@ i , J@@ ack S@@ ter@@ n ."
"And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to th@@ ank TED community super@@ st@@ ar H@@ ans R@@ os@@ ling , who you may have just seen ."
"O@@ kay , here we go ."
"So here you see , from 19@@ 60 to 20@@ 10 , the 50 years of our study ."
"T@@ w@@ o things we &apos;re going to start with — the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation state and the mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity state , which , for this pur@@ pose , we de@@ fin@@ ed in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation as tele@@ vision shows that up@@ li@@ ft me , that make me feel much more pos@@ itive about the world ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity are tele@@ vi@@ sions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
"As we start , you see in 19@@ 60 in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation is hol@@ ding ste@@ ad@@ y ."
That &apos;s what we &apos;re wat@@ ching T@@ V for .
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity star@@ ts to clim@@ b .
"R@@ ight at the end of the 6@@ 0s , mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity is going up , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation is kind of on the wan@@ e ."
Why ?
"The C@@ ub@@ an M@@ is@@ s@@ ile C@@ ris@@ is , J@@ F@@ K is sh@@ ot , the C@@ i@@ vil R@@ i@@ ghts movement , ra@@ ce ri@@ ots , the V@@ i@@ et@@ nam W@@ ar , M@@ L@@ K is sh@@ ot , B@@ ob@@ by K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy is sh@@ ot , W@@ at@@ er@@ g@@ ate ."
L@@ o@@ ok what happens .
"In 19@@ 70 , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation pl@@ um@@ m@@ ets ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity takes off .
"They c@@ ross , but R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an , a tel@@ eg@@ eni@@ c pre@@ sid@@ ent , is in off@@ ice ."
It &apos;s trying to rec@@ over .
"But look , it can &apos;t : A@@ I@@ D@@ S , I@@ ran@@ -@@ Con@@ tr@@ a , the Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ger dis@@ aster , Ch@@ er@@ no@@ byl ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity be@@ comes the dom@@ in@@ ant mem@@ e in tele@@ vision from 199@@ 0 for the next 20 years .
Ta@@ ke a look at this .
This ch@@ art is going to do@@ cu@@ ment a very si@@ mil@@ ar tr@@ end .
"But in this case , we have com@@ for@@ t — the bu@@ b@@ ble in red — social com@@ men@@ t@@ ary and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence in bl@@ ue and gre@@ en ."
"Now this time on T@@ V you have &quot; &quot; B@@ on@@ an@@ za , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t for@@ get , you have &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith , &quot; &quot; you have dom@@ est@@ ic shows all about com@@ for@@ t ."
This is ri@@ sing . C@@ om@@ for@@ t sta@@ ys whole .
I@@ r@@ re@@ ver@@ ence star@@ ts to ri@@ se .
So@@ cial com@@ men@@ t@@ ary is all of a sud@@ den spi@@ king up .
"You get to 19@@ 6@@ 9 , and look what happens ."
"You have com@@ for@@ t , ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence , and social com@@ men@@ t@@ ary , not only bat@@ t@@ ling it out in our society , but you liter@@ ally have two est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment shows — &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; G@@ om@@ er P@@ y@@ le &quot; &quot; — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 are the num@@ ber@@ -@@ tw@@ o@@ - and num@@ ber@@ -@@ thre@@ e-@@ rat@@ ed tele@@ vision shows ."
What &apos;s number one ?
"The soci@@ ally ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent hi@@ pp@@ ie show , &quot; R@@ ow@@ an and Mar@@ t@@ in &apos;s L@@ augh@@ -@@ In . &quot;"
"They &apos;re all living together , right ."
V@@ i@@ e@@ wers had respon@@ ded dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally .
L@@ o@@ ok at this gre@@ en sp@@ ike in 19@@ 6@@ 6 to a bel@@ l@@ we@@ ther show .
"When you guys hear this indu@@ stry ter@@ m , a bre@@ ak@@ out h@@ it , what does that mean ?"
"It means in the 19@@ 6@@ 6 tele@@ vision se@@ as@@ on , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mo@@ thers B@@ ro@@ thers &quot; &quot; came out of no@@ where ."
"This was the first show that allo@@ wed vi@@ e@@ wers to say , &quot; &quot; My G@@ od , I can com@@ ment on how I feel about the V@@ i@@ et@@ nam W@@ ar , about the pre@@ si@@ den@@ cy , through tele@@ vision ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a bre@@ ak@@ out show ."
"So then , just like the last ch@@ art , look what happens ."
"In 19@@ 70 , the da@@ m bur@@ sts . The da@@ m bur@@ sts ."
C@@ om@@ for@@ t is no longer why we wat@@ ch tele@@ vision .
So@@ cial com@@ men@@ t@@ ary and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence ri@@ se throu@@ gh@@ out the 7@@ 0s .
Now look at this .
The 7@@ 0s means who ? Nor@@ man Le@@ ar .
"You have &quot; &quot; All in the F@@ am@@ ily , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ an@@ for@@ d and S@@ on , &quot; &quot; and the dom@@ in@@ ant show — in the to@@ p@@ -@@ 10 for the entire 7@@ 0s — &quot; M@@ A@@ S * H@@ . &quot;"
"In the entire 50 years of tele@@ vision that we studi@@ ed , se@@ ven of 10 shows ran@@ ked most high@@ ly for ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence appe@@ a@@ red on air during the V@@ i@@ et@@ nam W@@ ar , five of the to@@ p@@ -@@ 10 during the N@@ i@@ x@@ on ad@@ min@@ ist@@ r@@ ation ."
"O@@ n@@ ly one gener@@ ation , 20 years in , and we discover@@ ed , W@@ ow ! T@@ V can do that ?"
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
"So to this very , very sav@@ vy c@@ ro@@ w@@ d , I also want to not@@ e the dig@@ ital fol@@ ks did not inv@@ ent dis@@ rup@@ tive ."
Ar@@ chi@@ e B@@ un@@ k@@ er was sh@@ ov@@ ed out of his easy cha@@ ir along with the re@@ st of us 40 years ago .
"This is a qu@@ ick ch@@ art . Here &apos;s another at@@ tri@@ bu@@ te : fanta@@ sy and imag@@ in@@ ation , which are shows de@@ fin@@ ed as , &quot; takes me out of my every@@ day re@@ al@@ m &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ma@@ pped against the red do@@ t , u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment , which is a simple B@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u of L@@ ab@@ or De@@ part@@ ment stati@@ st@@ ic ."
"You &apos;ll see that every time fanta@@ sy and imag@@ in@@ ation shows ri@@ se , it ma@@ ps to a sp@@ ike in u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment ."
Do we want to see shows about people sav@@ ing money and being u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ yed ?
"No . In the 7@@ 0s you have the bel@@ l@@ we@@ ther show &quot; &quot; The Bi@@ on@@ ic W@@ om@@ an &quot; &quot; that ro@@ ck@@ et@@ ed into the to@@ p@@ -@@ 10 in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , fol@@ lo@@ wed by the &quot; &quot; S@@ i@@ x M@@ illi@@ on@@ -@@ D@@ ol@@ la@@ r M@@ an &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e &apos;s An@@ g@@ els . &quot; &quot; A@@ no@@ ther sp@@ ike in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s — another sp@@ ike in shows about control and power ."
What were those shows ?
G@@ la@@ mo@@ rou@@ s and ri@@ ch .
"&quot; D@@ all@@ as , &quot; &quot; F@@ anta@@ sy I@@ sl@@ and . &quot;"
In@@ cre@@ di@@ ble ma@@ pp@@ ing of our national p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e with some hard and f@@ ast fac@@ ts : u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment .
"So here you are , in my fav@@ or@@ ite ch@@ art , because this is our last 20 years ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther or not you &apos;re in my business , you have su@@ rely heard or read of the de@@ cl@@ ine of the thing called the thre@@ e-@@ cam@@ era sit@@ c@@ om and the ri@@ se of reality T@@ V ."
"Well , as we say in the business , X mar@@ ks the spo@@ t ."
"The 9@@ 0s — the big bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es of hu@@ mo@@ r — we &apos;re wat@@ ching &quot; &quot; F@@ ri@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ra@@ si@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ e@@ ers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ el@@ d . &quot; &quot; E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing &apos;s good , low u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment ."
But look : X mar@@ ks the spo@@ t .
"In 200@@ 1 , the S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 200@@ 1 tele@@ vision se@@ as@@ on , hu@@ mo@@ r succ@@ um@@ b@@ s to ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment once and for all ."
Why not ?
We had a 20@@ 00 pre@@ sid@@ ential elec@@ tion decided by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
We had the bur@@ st@@ ing of the te@@ ch bu@@ b@@ ble .
We had 9 / 11 .
An@@ th@@ ra@@ x be@@ comes part of the social le@@ x@@ ic@@ on .
L@@ o@@ ok what happens when we keep going .
"A@@ t the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality tele@@ vision has taken h@@ old ."
What do people want in their T@@ V then ?
I would have thought re@@ ven@@ ge or nost@@ al@@ gi@@ a .
G@@ i@@ ve me some com@@ for@@ t ; my world is f@@ all@@ ing a@@ part .
"No , they want ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment ."
I can v@@ ot@@ e you off the isl@@ and .
I can keep S@@ a@@ ra@@ h P@@ al@@ in &apos;s d@@ aughter dan@@ cing .
I can cho@@ ose the next American I@@ do@@ l . You &apos;re fi@@ red .
"That &apos;s all great , right ?"
"So as dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally different as these tele@@ vision shows , p@@ ure en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one ba@@ sic inst@@ in@@ ct re@@ ma@@ ins ."
"We &apos;re animals , we need our mo@@ ms ."
"There has not been a de@@ ca@@ de of tele@@ vision without a de@@ fin@@ itive , dom@@ in@@ ant T@@ V mom ."
"The 19@@ 5@@ 0s : Ju@@ ne C@@ le@@ ever in the orig@@ in@@ al com@@ for@@ t show , &quot; &quot; Le@@ ave it to B@@ e@@ av@@ er . &quot; &quot; L@@ u@@ c@@ il@@ le B@@ all k@@ ept us l@@ augh@@ ing through the ri@@ se of social consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess in the 6@@ 0s ."
"M@@ au@@ de F@@ in@@ dl@@ ay , the ep@@ it@@ ome of the ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent 19@@ 7@@ 0s , who ta@@ c@@ kl@@ ed ab@@ or@@ tion , di@@ vor@@ ce , even men@@ op@@ ause on T@@ V ."
"The 19@@ 8@@ 0s , our first cou@@ g@@ ar was given to us in the form of A@@ le@@ x@@ is C@@ ar@@ r@@ ing@@ ton ."
M@@ ur@@ ph@@ y B@@ ro@@ wn took on a vice pre@@ sid@@ ent when she took on the idea of single par@@ en@@ th@@ o@@ od .
"This era &apos;s mom , B@@ ree V@@ an de K@@ am@@ p ."
"Now I don &apos;t know if this is the de@@ vil or the ang@@ el sit@@ ting on our con@@ science , sit@@ ting on tele@@ vision &apos;s sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders , but I do know that I absol@@ ut@@ ely love this image ."
"So to you all , the women of TE@@ D@@ W@@ om@@ en , the men of TE@@ D@@ W@@ om@@ en , the global audi@@ ences of TE@@ D@@ W@@ om@@ en , th@@ ank you for let@@ ting me present my idea about the con@@ science of tele@@ vision ."
But let me also th@@ ank the incredi@@ ble cre@@ at@@ ors who get up every@@ day to put their ideas on our tele@@ vision scre@@ ens throu@@ gh@@ out all these ages of tele@@ vision .
"They give it life on tele@@ vision , for sure , but it &apos;s you as vi@@ e@@ wers , through your colle@@ ctive social consci@@ ences , that give it life , lon@@ g@@ ev@@ ity , power or not ."
So th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause )
"Well we all know the Wor@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b has absol@@ ut@@ ely trans@@ form@@ ed publi@@ sh@@ ing , bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ing , com@@ mer@@ ce and social conne@@ c@@ tiv@@ ity , but where did it all come from ?"
"And I &apos;ll quot@@ e three people : V@@ an@@ ne@@ va@@ r B@@ us@@ h , D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art and T@@ im B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ L@@ ee ."
So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
This is V@@ an@@ ne@@ va@@ r B@@ us@@ h .
V@@ an@@ ne@@ va@@ r B@@ us@@ h was the U.@@ S. government &apos;s chi@@ e@@ f scienti@@ fic ad@@ vis@@ er during the war .
"And in 19@@ 4@@ 5 , he publi@@ shed an arti@@ cle in a magaz@@ ine called A@@ t@@ lan@@ ti@@ c M@@ on@@ th@@ ly ."
And the arti@@ cle was called &quot; &quot; A@@ s We M@@ ay Th@@ in@@ k . &quot; &quot; And what V@@ an@@ ne@@ va@@ r B@@ us@@ h was saying was the way we use information is bro@@ k@@ en .
We don &apos;t work in terms of li@@ bra@@ ri@@ es and cat@@ al@@ o@@ g systems and so for@@ th .
The brain works by as@@ soci@@ ation .
"W@@ ith one it@@ em in its thought , it s@@ na@@ ps in@@ stan@@ tly to the next it@@ em ."
And the way information is struc@@ tu@@ red is tot@@ ally in@@ cap@@ able of ke@@ ep@@ ing up with this process .
"And so he su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed a machine , and he called it the mem@@ ex ."
"And the mem@@ ex would lin@@ k information , one piece of information to a rel@@ ated piece of information and so for@@ th ."
Now this was in 19@@ 4@@ 5 .
A computer in those days was something the se@@ cre@@ t ser@@ vi@@ ces used to use for c@@ ode bre@@ a@@ king .
And no@@ body knew anything about it .
So this was before the computer was inv@@ ented .
And he pro@@ posed this machine called the mem@@ ex .
"And he had a plat@@ form where you lin@@ ked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will ."
"So sp@@ inning for@@ ward , one of the guys who read this arti@@ cle was a guy called D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art , and he was a U.@@ S. A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce off@@ ic@@ er ."
And he was read@@ ing it in their li@@ bra@@ ry in the F@@ ar E@@ ast .
"And he was so in@@ spi@@ red by this arti@@ cle , it kind of direc@@ ted the re@@ st of his life ."
"And by the mid@@ -@@ 6@@ 0s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the S@@ tan@@ for@@ d R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch L@@ a@@ b in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
He built a system .
"The system was desig@@ ned to au@@ g@@ ment human intellig@@ ence , it was called ."
"And in a pre@@ mon@@ ition of today &apos;s world of cl@@ ou@@ d comp@@ ut@@ ing and so@@ f@@ tw@@ are@@ s of ser@@ vice , his system was called N@@ L@@ S for o@@ N@@ -@@ L@@ ine S@@ y@@ st@@ em ."
And this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art .
He was gi@@ ving a pres@@ ent@@ ation at the F@@ all J@@ o@@ in@@ t C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter Con@@ fer@@ ence in 19@@ 6@@ 8 .
"What he sho@@ wed — he s@@ at on a stage like this , and he demon@@ strat@@ ed this system ."
He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
And he works this system .
"And you can see , he &apos;s working between do@@ cu@@ ments and gra@@ ph@@ ics and so for@@ th ."
"And he &apos;s dri@@ ving it all with this plat@@ form here , with a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ fin@@ ger ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard and the world &apos;s first computer m@@ ou@@ se , which he speci@@ ally desig@@ ned in order to do this system ."
So this is where the m@@ ou@@ se came from as well .
So this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art .
The t@@ rou@@ ble with D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art &apos;s system was that the compu@@ ters in those days cost sever@@ al million po@@ un@@ ds .
"So for a pers@@ onal computer , a few million po@@ un@@ ds was like having a pers@@ onal j@@ et plan@@ e ; it wasn &apos;t really very pra@@ cti@@ cal ."
"But sp@@ in on to the 8@@ 0s when pers@@ onal compu@@ ters did ar@@ ri@@ ve , then there was room for this kind of system on pers@@ onal compu@@ ters ."
"And my company , O@@ W@@ L built a system called G@@ u@@ i@@ de for the Ap@@ ple M@@ ac@@ in@@ to@@ sh ."
And we deli@@ ver@@ ed the world &apos;s first hy@@ per@@ text system .
And this beg@@ an to get a head of ste@@ am .
"A@@ p@@ ple in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed a thing called H@@ y@@ per@@ C@@ ard , and they made a bit of a f@@ us@@ s about it ."
They had a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ p@@ age sup@@ pl@@ ement in the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ nal the day it lau@@ n@@ ched .
The magaz@@ ines started to c@@ over it .
B@@ y@@ te magaz@@ ine and C@@ om@@ munic@@ ations at the A@@ C@@ M had speci@@ al issu@@ es c@@ over@@ ing hy@@ per@@ text .
We develop@@ ed a P@@ C ver@@ sion of this produc@@ t as well as the M@@ ac@@ in@@ to@@ sh ver@@ sion .
And our P@@ C ver@@ sion became quite mat@@ ure .
These are some exam@@ ples of this system in action in the l@@ ate 8@@ 0s .
"You were able to deli@@ ver do@@ cu@@ ments , were able to do it over net@@ works ."
We develop@@ ed a system such that it had a mark@@ up language based on h@@ t@@ m@@ l .
We called it h@@ m@@ l : hy@@ per@@ text mark@@ up language .
"And the system was cap@@ able of doing very , very large do@@ cu@@ men@@ t@@ ation systems over computer net@@ works ."
So I took this system to a tra@@ de show in V@@ er@@ sa@@ ill@@ es ne@@ ar Par@@ is in l@@ ate N@@ ov@@ ember 199@@ 0 .
"And I was appro@@ ach@@ ed by a ni@@ ce young man called T@@ im B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ L@@ ee who said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you I@@ an R@@ it@@ chi@@ e ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his pro@@ posed system called the Wor@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b ."
"And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pret@@ enti@@ ous name , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally since the whole system ran on his computer in his off@@ ice ."
But he was completely con@@ vin@@ ced that his Wor@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b would take over the world one day .
"And he tri@@ ed to per@@ su@@ a@@ de me to write the bro@@ w@@ s@@ er for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any gra@@ ph@@ ics or f@@ on@@ ts or la@@ y@@ out or anything ; it was just pla@@ in text ."
"I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from C@@ E@@ R@@ N , he &apos;s not going to do this ."
So we didn &apos;t do it .
"In the next couple of years , the hy@@ per@@ text community didn &apos;t recogniz@@ e him ei@@ ther ."
"In 199@@ 2 , his pa@@ per was re@@ jec@@ ted for the H@@ y@@ per@@ text Con@@ fer@@ ence ."
"In 199@@ 3 , there was a table at the con@@ fer@@ ence in Se@@ at@@ tle , and a guy called Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ es@@ se@@ n was demon@@ strat@@ ing his little bro@@ w@@ s@@ er for the Wor@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b ."
"And I saw it , and I thought , ye@@ p , that &apos;s it ."
"And the very next year , in 199@@ 4 , we had the con@@ fer@@ ence here in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh , and I had no op@@ pos@@ ition in having T@@ im B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ L@@ ee as the ke@@ y@@ not@@ e spe@@ ak@@ er ."
So that put@@ s me in pretty il@@ lu@@ stri@@ ous company .
There was a guy called D@@ ick R@@ o@@ we who was at D@@ ec@@ ca R@@ ec@@ or@@ ds and turned down The B@@ e@@ at@@ les .
"There was a guy called G@@ ary K@@ il@@ d@@ all who went fl@@ ying his plan@@ e when I@@ B@@ M came looking for an oper@@ ating system for the I@@ B@@ M P@@ C , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see B@@ ill G@@ ates ."
"And the 12 publi@@ sh@@ ers who turned down J@@ .@@ K@@ . R@@ ow@@ ling &apos;s H@@ ar@@ ry P@@ ot@@ ter , I gu@@ ess ."
"On the other hand , there &apos;s Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ es@@ se@@ n who w@@ ro@@ te the world &apos;s first bro@@ w@@ s@@ er for the Wor@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b ."
"And ac@@ cor@@ ding to F@@ or@@ tu@@ ne magaz@@ ine , he &apos;s wor@@ th 7@@ 00 million dollars ."
But is he happy ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
"In 199@@ 4 , I wal@@ ked into a pri@@ son in C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia , and I met a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y who had been tor@@ tu@@ red and was d@@ eni@@ ed acc@@ ess to coun@@ se@@ l ."
"And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hun@@ dre@@ ds of let@@ ters I had writ@@ ten for polit@@ ical pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers , that I would never have writ@@ ten a let@@ ter for him , because he was not a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y who had done something important for any@@ body ."
He was not a polit@@ ical pri@@ s@@ on@@ er .
He was a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y who had stol@@ en a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
"What I also realized at that point was that it was not only C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia , but of the 1@@ 1@@ 3 develop@@ ing countries that tor@@ ture , 9@@ 3 of these countries have all pas@@ sed la@@ ws that say you have a right to a la@@ w@@ y@@ er and you have a right not to be tor@@ tu@@ red ."
And what I recogniz@@ ed was that there was an incredi@@ ble win@@ do@@ w of opport@@ unity for us as a world community to come together and end tor@@ ture as an invest@@ ig@@ ative to@@ ol .
"We often think of tor@@ ture as being polit@@ ical tor@@ ture or re@@ ser@@ ved for just the wor@@ st , but , in fact , 9@@ 5 percent of tor@@ ture today is not for polit@@ ical pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers ."
"It is for people who are in bro@@ k@@ en@@ -@@ down leg@@ al systems , and un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately because tor@@ ture is the che@@ ap@@ est form of invest@@ ig@@ ation — it &apos;s che@@ ap@@ er than having a leg@@ al system , che@@ ap@@ er than having a la@@ w@@ y@@ er and early acc@@ ess to coun@@ se@@ l — it is what happens most of the time ."
"I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a deci@@ sion , to come together and end tor@@ ture as an invest@@ ig@@ ative to@@ ol in our li@@ f@@ et@@ im@@ e , but it will re@@ qui@@ re three things ."
"F@@ i@@ rst is the tra@@ ining , em@@ power@@ ment , and conne@@ ction of def@@ en@@ ders wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
The second is in@@ sur@@ ing that there is syst@@ em@@ atic early acc@@ ess to coun@@ se@@ l .
And the third is comm@@ it@@ ment .
"So in the year 20@@ 00 , I beg@@ an to won@@ der , what if we came together ?"
C@@ ould we do something for these 9@@ 3 countries ?
And I f@@ oun@@ ded Inter@@ national B@@ ri@@ d@@ ges to Ju@@ st@@ ice which has a speci@@ fic mis@@ sion of en@@ ding tor@@ ture as an invest@@ ig@@ ative to@@ ol and im@@ ple@@ men@@ ting du@@ e process ri@@ ghts in the 9@@ 3 countries by plac@@ ing tra@@ ined la@@ w@@ y@@ ers at an early stage in poli@@ ce st@@ ations and in cour@@ tro@@ om@@ s .
"My first experi@@ ences , though , did come from C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia , and at the time I remember first coming to C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia and there were , in 199@@ 4 , still less than 10 at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys in the country because the K@@ h@@ mer R@@ ou@@ ge had kill@@ ed them all ."
"And even 20 years later , there was only 10 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers in the country , so con@@ sequ@@ ently you &apos;d walk into a pri@@ son and not only would you me@@ et 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ ys , you &apos;d me@@ et women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; W@@ om@@ en would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my h@@ us@@ b@@ and comm@@ it@@ ted a cri@@ me , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no ru@@ le of la@@ w ."
"The first group of def@@ en@@ ders came together and I still remember , as I was tra@@ ining , I said , &quot; O@@ kay , what do you do for an invest@@ ig@@ ation ? &quot;"
"And there was sil@@ ence in the clas@@ s , and finally one woman sto@@ od up , &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ re@@ w , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teach@@ er . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have def@@ en@@ ded more than a hun@@ d@@ red people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any invest@@ ig@@ ation , because they all come with conf@@ es@@ sions . &quot; &quot; And we tal@@ ked about , as a clas@@ s , the fact that number one , the conf@@ es@@ sions might not be reli@@ able , but number two , we did not want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the poli@@ ce to keep doing this , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally as it was now against the la@@ w ."
And it took a lot of cou@@ ra@@ ge for these def@@ en@@ ders to deci@@ de that they would beg@@ in to stand up and sup@@ port each other in im@@ ple@@ men@@ ting these la@@ ws .
"And I still remember the first c@@ ases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would sup@@ port her , and the ju@@ d@@ ges k@@ ept saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the ex@@ act same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perf@@ ect case came , and it was a woman who was a ve@@ get@@ able sel@@ l@@ er , she was sit@@ ting outside of a house ."
"S@@ he said she actually saw the person run out who she thin@@ ks st@@ ole what@@ ever the j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry was , but the poli@@ ce came , they got her , there was nothing on her ."
She was pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant at the time . She had ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ te bur@@ ns on her . She &apos;d mis@@ car@@ ri@@ ed .
"And when they b@@ rou@@ ght her case to the ju@@ d@@ ge , for the first time he sto@@ od up and he said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , there &apos;s no evid@@ ence exc@@ ept for your tor@@ ture conf@@ es@@ sion and you will be re@@ le@@ as@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And the def@@ en@@ ders beg@@ an to take c@@ ases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step beg@@ an to change the course of history in C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia ."
But C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia is not alone .
"I used to think , well is it C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia ?"
O@@ r is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
"In B@@ u@@ ru@@ n@@ di I wal@@ ked into a pri@@ son and it wasn &apos;t a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y , it was an 8@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y for ste@@ al@@ ing a mobil@@ e phone ."
"O@@ r a woman , I pic@@ ked up her bab@@ y , really c@@ ute bab@@ y , I said &quot; &quot; Y@@ our bab@@ y is so c@@ ute . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a bab@@ y , she was three ."
"And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was acc@@ used of ste@@ al@@ ing two di@@ a@@ per@@ s and an i@@ ro@@ n for her bab@@ y and still had been in pri@@ son ."
"And when I wal@@ ked up to the pri@@ son direc@@ tor , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out ."
"A ju@@ d@@ ge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , we can talk about it , but look at my pri@@ son . E@@ igh@@ ty percent of the two thou@@ s@@ and people here are without a la@@ w@@ y@@ er . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So la@@ w@@ y@@ ers beg@@ an to cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously stand up together to organiz@@ e a system where they can take c@@ ases ."
"But we realized that it &apos;s not only the tra@@ ining of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , but the conne@@ ction of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers that makes a difference ."
"For example , in C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia , it was that &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; did not go alone but she had 2@@ 4 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers with her who sto@@ od up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a f@@ res@@ h w@@ ind in the des@@ er@@ t when we can come together . &quot; &quot; O@@ r in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , where I remember In@@ no@@ c@@ ent , after coming out of a pri@@ son where everybody sto@@ od up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , e@@ ight years , 12 years without a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a tra@@ ining together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people mu@@ m@@ bl@@ ing@@ "
"@@ and gru@@ m@@ bl@@ ing — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we can@@ not help to create ju@@ st@@ ice because we do not have the resour@@ ces . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the l@@ ack of resour@@ ces is never an exc@@ use for in@@ ju@@ st@@ ice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he succ@@ ess@@ fully organiz@@ ed 6@@ 8 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers who have been syst@@ emati@@ cally taking the c@@ ases ."
"The key that we see , though , is tra@@ ining and then early acc@@ ess ."
"I was rec@@ ently in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , and was in@@ spi@@ red to me@@ et with another group of la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , look , we don &apos;t have poli@@ ce on the stre@@ ets now . The poli@@ ce are one of the ma@@ in reas@@ ons why we had the revol@@ ution . They were tor@@ tur@@ ing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been ten@@ s of milli@@ ons of dollars that have rec@@ ently gone in to the develop@@ ment of the leg@@ al system here ."
"What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the develop@@ ment ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es , and they were tra@@ ining pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors and ju@@ d@@ ges , which is the norm@@ al bi@@ as , as op@@ posed to def@@ en@@ ders ."
And they sho@@ wed me a man@@ ual which actually was an exc@@ ell@@ ent man@@ ual .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m g@@ on@@ na c@@ op@@ y this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . L@@ aw@@ y@@ ers can come at the poli@@ ce st@@ ation . It was perf@@ ect ."
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors were perf@@ ec@@ tly tra@@ ined .
"But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a p@@ ause , they said , &quot; They had been tor@@ tu@@ red . &quot;"
"So the pi@@ ec@@ es are , not only the tra@@ ining of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , but us fin@@ ding a way to syst@@ emati@@ cally im@@ pl@@ ement early acc@@ ess to coun@@ se@@ l , because they are the sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard in the system for people who are being tor@@ tu@@ red ."
"And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the fact that it s@@ oun@@ ds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , o@@ kay , it s@@ oun@@ ds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it s@@ oun@@ ds big ."
And there are many reas@@ ons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of cre@@ ating mi@@ ra@@ cl@@ es because of their comm@@ it@@ ment .
"It &apos;s not only In@@ no@@ c@@ ent , who I told you about in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , but def@@ en@@ ders all over the world who are looking for these pi@@ ec@@ es ."
"We have a progra@@ m called Ju@@ st@@ ic@@ e@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , and we realized there are people that are cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous and want to do things , but how can we sup@@ port them ?"
So it &apos;s an on@@ line con@@ test where it &apos;s only five thou@@ s@@ and dollars if you come up with and innov@@ ative way of im@@ ple@@ men@@ ting ju@@ st@@ ice .
"And there are 30 Ju@@ st@@ ic@@ e@@ M@@ ak@@ ers throu@@ gh@@ out the world , from S@@ ri L@@ an@@ ka to S@@ w@@ az@@ il@@ and to the D@@ R@@ C , who with five thou@@ s@@ and dollars do amazing things , through S@@ M@@ S progra@@ ms , through par@@ al@@ eg@@ al progra@@ ms , through what@@ ever they can do ."
"And it &apos;s not only these Ju@@ st@@ ic@@ e@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , but people we cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously see figure out who their net@@ works are and how they can move it for@@ ward ."
"So in China , for in@@ stance , great la@@ ws came out where it says poli@@ ce can@@ not tor@@ ture people or they will be pu@@ ni@@ shed ."
"And I was sit@@ ting side by side with one of our very cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is im@@ ple@@ men@@ ted ?"
"This is fanta@@ st@@ ic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s o@@ kay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on D@@ ec@@ ember 4 , he organiz@@ ed three thou@@ s@@ and mem@@ bers of the Y@@ outh C@@ om@@ m@@ un@@ ist Le@@ ag@@ ue , from 1@@ 4 of the top la@@ w scho@@ ols , who organiz@@ ed themselves , develop@@ ed post@@ ers with the new la@@ ws , and went to the poli@@ ce st@@ ations and beg@@ an what he says is a no@@ n-@@ viol@@ ent leg@@ al revol@@ ution to prote@@ ct c@@ it@@ iz@@ en ri@@ ghts ."
So I tal@@ ked about the fact that we need to tra@@ in and sup@@ port def@@ en@@ ders .
We need to syst@@ emati@@ cally im@@ pl@@ ement early acc@@ ess to coun@@ se@@ l .
But the third and most important thing is that we make a comm@@ it@@ ment to this .
"And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s w@@ il@@ dly ide@@ al@@ ist@@ ic ."
"N@@ ever going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end sl@@ av@@ ery , or end a@@ par@@ the@@ id ."
It beg@@ an with a small group of people who decided they would comm@@ it .
"Now , there &apos;s one of our fav@@ or@@ ite po@@ ems from the def@@ en@@ ders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; Ta@@ ke cou@@ ra@@ ge friends , the ro@@ ad is often long , the pat@@ h is never clear , and the st@@ ak@@ es are very high , but de@@ ep down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to sup@@ port not only def@@ en@@ ders , but also everyone in the system who is looking to@@ wards it , we can end tor@@ ture as an invest@@ ig@@ ative to@@ ol ."
"I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . F@@ i@@ rst of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of V@@ ish@@ na , who actually was my in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation for star@@ ting Inter@@ national B@@ ri@@ d@@ ges to Ju@@ st@@ ice ."
"V@@ ish@@ na was a 4@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y when I met him who was born in a C@@ am@@ bod@@ i@@ an pri@@ son in K@@ an@@ d@@ al P@@ rov@@ in@@ ce . But because he was born in the pri@@ son , everybody lov@@ ed him , inclu@@ ding the gu@@ ar@@ ds , so he was the only one who was allo@@ wed to come in and out of the bar@@ s ."
"So , you know , there &apos;s bar@@ s . And by the time that V@@ ish@@ na was getting bi@@ g@@ ger , which means what gets bi@@ g@@ ger ? Y@@ our head gets bi@@ g@@ ger ."
"So he would come to the first b@@ ar , the second b@@ ar and then the third b@@ ar , and then really slo@@ w@@ ly move his head so he could f@@ it through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would gra@@ b my p@@ in@@ kie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go vi@@ sit ."
"You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to vi@@ sit all 1@@ 5@@ 6 pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers . And I would li@@ ft him , and he would put his fin@@ g@@ ers through ."
"O@@ r if they were dar@@ k cells , it was like i@@ ro@@ n cor@@ ru@@ g@@ ated , and he would put his fin@@ g@@ ers through ."
"And most of the pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers said that he was their gre@@ at@@ est jo@@ y and their su@@ n@@ sh@@ ine , and they looked for@@ ward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s V@@ ish@@ na . He &apos;s a 4@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y ."
"He was born in a pri@@ son with almost nothing , no material go@@ od@@ s , but he had a sense of his own her@@ o@@ ic jour@@ ney , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; P@@ rob@@ ably I can &apos;t do everything ."
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
"And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I th@@ ank you for having the pro@@ ph@@ et@@ ic imag@@ in@@ ation to imagine the sh@@ ap@@ ing of a new world with us together , and inv@@ ite you into this jour@@ ney with us ."
Thank you .

And I &apos;m talking about something far more val@@ u@@ able than off@@ ice f@@ ur@@ nit@@ ure .
I &apos;m talking about time . Y@@ our time .
"In fact , I believe that we are in the middle of a global ep@@ ide@@ mic of a ter@@ ri@@ ble new ill@@ ness known as M@@ A@@ S : M@@ in@@ dl@@ ess A@@ cc@@ ept S@@ y@@ n@@ dro@@ me ."

"And a w@@ ell@@ -@@ run me@@ et@@ ing can y@@ i@@ el@@ d really pos@@ itive , ac@@ tion@@ able resul@@ ts ."
"But between glob@@ aliz@@ ation and per@@ va@@ sive information technology , the way that we work has really changed dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally over the last few years ."
"And we &apos;re mis@@ er@@ able . ( Laughter ) And we &apos;re mis@@ er@@ able not because the other guy can &apos;t run a good me@@ et@@ ing , it &apos;s because of M@@ A@@ S , our M@@ in@@ dl@@ ess A@@ cc@@ ept S@@ y@@ n@@ dro@@ me , which is a self-@@ inf@@ lic@@ ted w@@ ound ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , I have evid@@ ence to pro@@ ve that M@@ A@@ S is a global ep@@ ide@@ mic ."

"A couple of years ago , I put a video on Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be , and in the video , I ac@@ ted out every ter@@ ri@@ ble con@@ fer@@ ence call you &apos;ve ever been on ."
"It goes on for about five minutes , and it has all the things that we h@@ ate about really bad me@@ et@@ ings ."
There &apos;s the mo@@ der@@ ator who has no idea how to run the me@@ et@@ ing .

"( V@@ ideo ) S@@ ir K@@ en R@@ ob@@ in@@ son : My con@@ ten@@ tion is that cre@@ ativ@@ ity now is as important in education as liter@@ ac@@ y , and we should tre@@ at it with the same stat@@ us ."
Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : E@@ l@@ ora H@@ ar@@ dy — building from b@@ am@@ bo@@ o is beautiful .
"( V@@ ideo ) E@@ l@@ ora H@@ ar@@ dy : It is gro@@ wing all around us , it &apos;s stron@@ g , it &apos;s ele@@ g@@ ant , it &apos;s ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ e-@@ re@@ sist@@ ant ."
C@@ A : Ch@@ im@@ am@@ an@@ da A@@ di@@ chi@@ e — people are more than a single id@@ ent@@ ity .
"C@@ A : Y@@ our mind is te@@ em@@ ing with ideas , and not just ran@@ dom@@ ly ."
They &apos;re care@@ fully lin@@ ked together .
C@@ ol@@ le@@ cti@@ vely they form an amaz@@ ing@@ ly complex structure that is your pers@@ onal wor@@ l@@ dvi@@ ew .
It &apos;s your brain &apos;s oper@@ ating system .
It &apos;s how you na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate the world .
And it is built up out of milli@@ ons of individu@@ al ideas .
"So , for example , if one little com@@ pon@@ ent of your wor@@ l@@ dvi@@ ew is the idea that kit@@ ten@@ s are ad@@ or@@ able , then when you see this , you &apos;ll re@@ act like this ."
"But if another com@@ pon@@ ent of your wor@@ l@@ dvi@@ ew is the idea that le@@ op@@ ar@@ ds are dan@@ ger@@ ous , then when you see this , you &apos;ll re@@ act a little bit differ@@ ently ."
"So , it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous why the ideas that make up your wor@@ l@@ dvi@@ ew are c@@ ru@@ cial ."
"You need them to be as reli@@ able as possible — a gu@@ i@@ de , to the sc@@ ary but wonderful real world out there ."
"Now , different people &apos;s wor@@ l@@ dvi@@ e@@ ws can be dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally different ."
"For example , how does your wor@@ l@@ dvi@@ ew re@@ act when you see this image : ( V@@ ideo ) D@@ ali@@ a M@@ og@@ a@@ h@@ ed : What do you think when you look at me ?"
"&quot; &quot; A woman of fa@@ ith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ex@@ per@@ t , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a sist@@ er &quot; &quot; ?"
"O@@ r &quot; &quot; op@@ pres@@ sed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bra@@ in@@ wa@@ shed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ st &quot; &quot; ?"
"C@@ A : Wh@@ at@@ ever your answer , there are milli@@ ons of people out there who would re@@ act very differ@@ ently ."
So that &apos;s why ideas really matter .
"If communic@@ ated pro@@ per@@ ly , they &apos;re cap@@ able of chang@@ ing , fore@@ ver , how someone thin@@ ks about the world , and sh@@ ap@@ ing their ac@@ tions both now and well into the future ."
I@@ de@@ as are the most powerful for@@ ce sh@@ ap@@ ing human culture .
"So if you acc@@ ept that your number one ta@@ s@@ k as a spe@@ ak@@ er is to build an idea inside the min@@ ds of your audi@@ ence , here are four gu@@ i@@ del@@ ines for how you should go about that ta@@ s@@ k : One , lim@@ it your talk to just one maj@@ or idea ."
"I@@ de@@ as are complex things ; you need to sl@@ ash back your con@@ t@@ ent so that you can foc@@ us on the single idea you &apos;re most pas@@ sion@@ ate about , and give y@@ ourself a chan@@ ce to expla@@ in that one thing pro@@ per@@ ly ."
"You have to give con@@ text , share exam@@ ples , make it vi@@ vid ."
"So pic@@ k one idea , and make it the throu@@ gh@@ -@@ line ru@@ n@@ ning through your entire talk , so that everything you say lin@@ ks back to it in some way ."
"T@@ w@@ o , give your list@@ en@@ ers a reason to care ."
"B@@ e@@ fore you can start building things inside the min@@ ds of your audi@@ ence , you have to get their per@@ mis@@ sion to w@@ el@@ come you in ."
And the ma@@ in to@@ ol to achi@@ eve that ?
C@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
S@@ ti@@ r your audi@@ ence &apos;s cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
"U@@ se in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing , pro@@ vo@@ c@@ ative questions to id@@ enti@@ fy why something doesn &apos;t make sense and needs expla@@ ining ."
"If you can re@@ ve@@ al a dis@@ conne@@ ction in someone &apos;s wor@@ l@@ dvi@@ ew , they &apos;ll feel the need to bri@@ d@@ ge that knowled@@ ge ga@@ p ."
"And once you &apos;ve sp@@ ar@@ ked that des@@ i@@ re , it will be so much e@@ a@@ si@@ er to start building your idea ."
"Th@@ ree , build your idea , piece by piece , out of conc@@ ep@@ ts that your audi@@ ence already under@@ stan@@ ds ."
"You use the power of language to we@@ ave together conc@@ ep@@ ts that already ex@@ ist in your list@@ en@@ ers &apos; min@@ ds — but not your language , their language ."
You start where they are .
"Now , met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors can play a c@@ ru@@ cial ro@@ le in sho@@ wing how the pi@@ ec@@ es f@@ it together , because they re@@ ve@@ al the des@@ i@@ red sh@@ ape of the patter@@ n , based on an idea that the list@@ en@@ er already under@@ stan@@ ds ."
"For example , when J@@ en@@ ni@@ f@@ er Ka@@ h@@ n wanted to expla@@ in the incredi@@ ble new bi@@ ot@@ ech@@ nolo@@ gy called C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R , she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s as if , for the first time , you had a word proc@@ ess@@ or to ed@@ it DN@@ A ."
"C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R allo@@ ws you to c@@ ut and pa@@ st@@ e genet@@ ic information really eas@@ ily . &quot; &quot; Now , a vi@@ vid ex@@ plan@@ ation like that deli@@ ver@@ s a s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ ying a@@ ha moment as it s@@ na@@ ps into place in our min@@ ds ."
"It &apos;s important , th@@ ere@@ fore , to test your talk on tru@@ st@@ ed friends , and find out which parts they get conf@@ used by ."
"F@@ our , here &apos;s the fin@@ al ti@@ p : Ma@@ ke your idea wor@@ th shar@@ ing ."
"B@@ y that I mean , ask y@@ ourself the question : &quot; Wh@@ o does this idea ben@@ ef@@ it ? &quot;"
And I need you to be h@@ on@@ est with the answer .
"If the idea only ser@@ ves you or your organiz@@ ation , then , I &apos;m sor@@ ry to say , it &apos;s probably not wor@@ th shar@@ ing ."
The audi@@ ence will see right through you .
"But if you believe that the idea has the pot@@ ential to bri@@ gh@@ ten up someone else &apos;s day or change someone else &apos;s perspe@@ ctive for the better or in@@ spi@@ re someone to do something differ@@ ently , then you have the cor@@ e in@@ gre@@ di@@ ent to a tru@@ ly great talk , one that can be a gi@@ ft to them and to all of us ."
"C@@ an I ask you to ple@@ ase rec@@ all a time when you really lov@@ ed something — a mo@@ vie , an al@@ bu@@ m , a s@@ ong or a book — and you re@@ com@@ men@@ ded it wh@@ ol@@ e@@ hear@@ te@@ dly to someone you also really li@@ ked , and you anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated that re@@ action , you wa@@ ited for it , and it came back , and the person h@@ ated it ?"
"So , by way of in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I sp@@ ent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school mat@@ h ."
"I s@@ ell a produc@@ t to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ ced by la@@ w to bu@@ y it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a lo@@ sing pro@@ pos@@ ition ."
"So there &apos;s a u@@ se@@ ful st@@ ere@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about students that I see , a u@@ se@@ ful st@@ ere@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about you all ."
"I could give you guys an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would expe@@ ct no high@@ er than a 25 percent pas@@ s rate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call mat@@ h education in the U.@@ S. today .
"To start with , I &apos;d like to bre@@ ak mat@@ h down into two cat@@ eg@@ ories ."
One is comp@@ ut@@ ation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ got@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ tor@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ati@@ cs with le@@ ad@@ ing co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ents gre@@ ater than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , pro@@ vid@@ ed you have a really stron@@ g gro@@ un@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the app@@ lic@@ ation of mat@@ h proc@@ ess@@ es to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.@@ S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a mat@@ h teach@@ er ."
"So first , five sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s that you &apos;re doing mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your clas@@ s@@ room ."
One is a l@@ ack of in@@ iti@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your le@@ c@@ ture blo@@ ck and im@@ medi@@ ately you have five hands going up as@@ king you to re@@ -@@ expla@@ in the entire thing at their des@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents l@@ ack per@@ sever@@ ance .
"They l@@ ack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find y@@ ourself re@@ -@@ expla@@ ining conc@@ ep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ale ."
"There &apos;s an aver@@ sion to word problems , which descri@@ b@@ es 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the form@@ ul@@ a to ap@@ ply in that situ@@ ation .
This is really dest@@ ru@@ ctive .
"D@@ av@@ id M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ ator of &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ wo@@ od &quot; &quot; and other amazing T@@ V shows , has a really good descri@@ p@@ tion for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating con@@ tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry dra@@ ma , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ re@@ spe@@ ct , it sh@@ ap@@ es the neu@@ ral pa@@ th@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they expe@@ ct simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an im@@ pati@@ ence with ir@@ re@@ solution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re im@@ pati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t re@@ sol@@ ve quickly ."
"You expe@@ ct sit@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three com@@ mer@@ cial bre@@ ak@@ s and a lau@@ gh tra@@ ck ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and w@@ ell@@ -@@ being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ oks — particul@@ arly mas@@ s@@ -@@ a@@ do@@ p@@ ted te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ oks — te@@ ach mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s fun@@ cti@@ on@@ ally equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and call@@ ing it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all seri@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess . Here &apos;s an example from a physi@@ cs te@@ x@@ t@@ book .
It app@@ li@@ es equ@@ ally to mat@@ h .
"N@@ ot@@ ice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pi@@ ec@@ es of information there , each of which will figure into a form@@ ul@@ a some@@ where , ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally , which the stud@@ ent will then comp@@ ute ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask y@@ ourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the given information in adv@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ pl@@ us of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have su@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the te@@ x@@ t@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s h@@ am@@ str@@ ing@@ ing students because , wat@@ ch this , this is the pra@@ cti@@ ce problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ wa@@ pp@@ ing out num@@ bers and t@@ we@@ a@@ king the con@@ text a little bit ."
"And if the stud@@ ent still doesn &apos;t recogniz@@ e the st@@ am@@ p this was mol@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ fully expla@@ ins to you what sam@@ ple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the form@@ ul@@ a ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , pas@@ s this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any physi@@ cs , just kno@@ wing how to dec@@ ode a te@@ x@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a sh@@ ame ."
So I can diag@@ no@@ se the problem a little more speci@@ fic@@ ally in mat@@ h .
Here &apos;s a really co@@ ol problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about de@@ fin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and slo@@ pe using a s@@ ki li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers , and I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers and , particul@@ arly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pres@@ sed together and pres@@ ented to the stud@@ ent all at once , how that cre@@ ates this im@@ pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll def@@ ine them here : You have the vis@@ ual .
"You also have the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal structure , talking about gri@@ ds , meas@@ u@@ remen@@ ts , lab@@ els , poin@@ ts , a@@ x@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ step@@ s , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which se@@ ction is the ste@@ ep@@ est ."
So I hope you can see .
"I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a comp@@ ell@@ ing question , a comp@@ ell@@ ing answer , but we &apos;re p@@ av@@ ing a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , stra@@ ight pat@@ h from one to the other and con@@ g@@ rat@@ ul@@ ating our students for how well they can step over the small cra@@ cks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the vis@@ ual , and I im@@ medi@@ ately ask the question : Wh@@ ich se@@ ction is the ste@@ ep@@ est ?"
And this star@@ ts con@@ vers@@ ation because the vis@@ ual is created in such a way where you can def@@ end two ans@@ wers .
"So you get people argu@@ ing against each other , friend ver@@ su@@ s friend , in pa@@ ir@@ s , jour@@ nal@@ ing , what@@ ever ."
And then ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally we realiz@@ e it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the s@@ ki@@ er in the lo@@ wer le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the s@@ ki@@ er just ab@@ ov@@ e the mi@@ d line .
"And we realiz@@ e how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D lab@@ els to talk about them more eas@@ ily ."
"And then as we start to def@@ ine what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realiz@@ e it would be ni@@ ce to have some meas@@ u@@ remen@@ ts to really nar@@ row it down , speci@@ fic@@ ally what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ row down that ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal structure ."
"The mat@@ h ser@@ ves the con@@ vers@@ ation , the con@@ vers@@ ation doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the mat@@ h ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 clas@@ ses are good to go on the whole slo@@ pe , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then devel@@ op those sub@@ step@@ s together ."
"D@@ o you guys see how this , right here , com@@ pa@@ red to that — which one cre@@ ates that pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , that mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been obvi@@ ous in my pra@@ cti@@ ce , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ i@@ el@@ d the flo@@ or here for a second to E@@ inst@@ e@@ in , who , I believe , has pa@@ id his du@@ es ."
"He tal@@ ked about the form@@ ul@@ ation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my pra@@ cti@@ ce , in the U.@@ S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t invol@@ ve them in the form@@ ul@@ ation of the problem ."
So 9@@ 0 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ ell@@ ing ele@@ ments of problems like this from my te@@ x@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that sup@@ por@@ ts mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water t@@ ank .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ i@@ rst things first , we el@@ im@@ in@@ ate all the sub@@ step@@ s ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents have to devel@@ op those , they have to form@@ ul@@ ate those ."
And then not@@ ice that all the information writ@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"N@@ one of it &apos;s a di@@ stra@@ c@@ tor , so we lo@@ se that ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents need to deci@@ de , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the col@@ or of the val@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; Su@@ ch an under@@ re@@ pres@@ ented question in mat@@ h cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .
So now we have a water t@@ ank .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or c@@ li@@ p art that you so often see in te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ oks , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real de@@ al .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone f@@ ill@@ ing it up ."
"And it &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ing up slo@@ w@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly slo@@ w@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents are looking at their wat@@ ch@@ es , ro@@ l@@ ling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ ited the ho@@ ok , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fu@@ n for me because , like the in@@ tr@@ o , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a con@@ vers@@ ation about mat@@ h because someone else has the form@@ ul@@ a ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the form@@ ul@@ a better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stud@@ ent is on a level pla@@ ying fiel@@ d of in@@ tu@@ ition ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ one &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ed something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cally and con@@ vers@@ ation@@ ally in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated jo@@ ining the con@@ vers@@ ation ."
"We put na@@ m@@ es on the bo@@ ard , atta@@ ch them to gu@@ ess@@ es , and kids have b@@ ou@@ ght in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve descri@@ bed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teach@@ er &apos;s ed@@ ition ."
"We , instead , just wat@@ ch the end of the mo@@ vie ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ ore@@ ti@@ cal model@@ s that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teach@@ er &apos;s ed@@ ition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s sc@@ ary to talk about sour@@ ces of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ ore@@ ti@@ cal does not mat@@ ch up with the pra@@ cti@@ cal ."
"But those con@@ vers@@ ations have been so val@@ u@@ able , am@@ ong the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ port some really fu@@ n g@@ am@@ es with students who come pre@@ -@@ inst@@ all@@ ed with these viru@@ ses day one of the clas@@ s .
"Th@@ ese are the kids who now , one se@@ mest@@ er in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , tot@@ ally new , tot@@ ally fore@@ ig@@ n , and they &apos;ll have a con@@ vers@@ ation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fu@@ n ."
"We &apos;re no longer aver@@ se to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ de@@ fin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated by mat@@ h , because we &apos;re slo@@ w@@ ly re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing what mat@@ h is ."
This has been a lot of fu@@ n .
"I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge mat@@ h teach@@ ers I talk to to use mul@@ tim@@ e@@ di@@ a , because it br@@ ings the real world into your clas@@ s@@ room in high re@@ solution and full col@@ or ; to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge stud@@ ent in@@ tu@@ ition for that level pla@@ ying fiel@@ d ; to ask the shor@@ test question you pos@@ si@@ bly can and let those more speci@@ fic questions come out in con@@ vers@@ ation ; to let students build the problem , because E@@ inst@@ e@@ in said so ; and to finally , in tot@@ al , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the te@@ x@@ t@@ book is hel@@ ping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ lig@@ ation , for pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving and mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an amazing time to be a mat@@ h teach@@ er right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um in our front po@@ ck@@ et .
"It &apos;s ubi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fa@@ ir@@ ly che@@ a@@ p , and the to@@ ols to di@@ stri@@ bu@@ te it fre@@ ely under open lic@@ en@@ ses has also never been che@@ ap@@ er or more ubi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a video seri@@ es on my blo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vi@@ e@@ ws in two we@@ eks ."
"I get em@@ ail@@ s still from teach@@ ers in countries I &apos;ve never vis@@ ited saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ ah . We had a good con@@ vers@@ ation about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow ."
"I put this problem on my blo@@ g rec@@ ently : In a gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore , which line do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 1@@ 9 it@@ ems or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one it@@ ems ."
"And the lin@@ e@@ ar model@@ ing invol@@ ved in that was some good stuff for my clas@@ s@@ room , but it ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally got me on &quot; &quot; Go@@ od M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few we@@ eks later , which is just biz@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ clu@@ de that people , not just students , are really hun@@ g@@ ry for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary for your own in@@ tu@@ ition .
"So I just really en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , what@@ ever your sta@@ ke is in education — whether you &apos;re a stud@@ ent , par@@ ent , teach@@ er , po@@ lic@@ y mak@@ er , what@@ ever — in@@ si@@ st on better mat@@ h cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um ."
We need more pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
It means to play so@@ f@@ tly .
"If you &apos;re pla@@ ying a mu@@ si@@ cal instru@@ ment and you not@@ ice a &quot; &quot; p &quot; &quot; in the sc@@ ore , you need to play so@@ f@@ ter ."
T@@ w@@ o p &apos;s — even so@@ f@@ ter .
F@@ our p &apos;s — ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely so@@ ft .
"This is my dra@@ wing of a p@@ -@@ tre@@ e , which demon@@ strat@@ es no matter how many thousands u@@ po@@ n thousands of p &apos;s there may be , you &apos;ll never re@@ ach compl@@ ete sil@@ ence ."
That &apos;s my cur@@ r@@ ent de@@ fin@@ ition of sil@@ ence : a very ob@@ sc@@ ure sound .
"I &apos;d like to share a little bit about the history of American S@@ ig@@ n L@@ an@@ gu@@ age , A@@ S@@ L , pl@@ us a bit of my own back@@ ground ."
"F@@ ren@@ ch sig@@ n language was b@@ rou@@ ght to America during the early 1@@ 8@@ 0@@ 0s , and as time went by , mi@@ x@@ ed with local sig@@ ns , it evol@@ ved into the language we know today as A@@ S@@ L ."
So it has a history of about 2@@ 00 years .
"I was born de@@ a@@ f , and I was ta@@ u@@ ght to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life ."
And I beli@@ ev@@ ed it to be true .
"@@ Y@@ et , I realiz@@ e now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all ."
"S@@ ound was very much a part of my life , really , on my mind every day ."
"As a De@@ a@@ f person living in a world of sound , it &apos;s as if I was living in a fore@@ ig@@ n country , bl@@ in@@ dly fol@@ lo@@ wing its ru@@ les , cu@@ st@@ om@@ s , behavi@@ ors and nor@@ ms without ever questi@@ on@@ ing them ."
So how is it that I understand sound ?
"Well , I wat@@ ch how people be@@ have and res@@ po@@ nd to sound ."
"You people are like my l@@ ou@@ d@@ spe@@ ak@@ ers , and am@@ pli@@ fy sound ."
I learn and mir@@ ro@@ r that behavi@@ or .
"A@@ t the same time , I &apos;ve learned that I create sound , and I &apos;ve seen how people res@@ po@@ nd to me ."
"Th@@ us I &apos;ve learned , for example ..@@ ."
&quot; D@@ on &apos;t s@@ la@@ m the do@@ or ! &quot;
&quot; D@@ on &apos;t make too much no@@ ise when you &apos;re e@@ ating from the pot@@ at@@ o-@@ chi@@ p ba@@ g ! &quot;
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t bur@@ p , and when you &apos;re e@@ ating , make sure you don &apos;t sc@@ ra@@ pe your ut@@ en@@ sil@@ s on the pl@@ ate . &quot; &quot; All of these things I ter@@ m &quot; &quot; sound et@@ i@@ qu@@ et@@ te . &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ybe I think about sound et@@ i@@ qu@@ et@@ te more than the aver@@ age hear@@ ing person does ."
I &apos;m hy@@ per@@ -@@ vi@@ g@@ il@@ ant around sound .
"And I &apos;m always wa@@ iting in e@@ ag@@ er ner@@ v@@ ous anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation around sound , about what &apos;s to come next ."
"H@@ ence , this dra@@ wing ."
"T@@ B@@ D , to be decided ."
"T@@ B@@ C , to be contin@@ u@@ ed ."
"T@@ B@@ A , to be an@@ no@@ un@@ ced ."
And you not@@ ice the st@@ af@@ f — there are no not@@ es con@@ ta@@ ined in the lin@@ es .
That &apos;s because the lin@@ es already con@@ tain sound through the sub@@ tle s@@ mu@@ d@@ ges and s@@ me@@ ar@@ s .
"In De@@ a@@ f culture , movement is equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to sound ."
This is a sig@@ n for &quot; &quot; st@@ af@@ f &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
A ty@@ p@@ ical st@@ af@@ f con@@ ta@@ ins five lin@@ es .
"@@ Y@@ et for me , sig@@ ning it with my th@@ um@@ b st@@ ic@@ king up like that doesn &apos;t feel natural ."
"That &apos;s why you &apos;ll not@@ ice in my dra@@ w@@ ings , I st@@ ick to four lin@@ es on pa@@ per ."
"In the year 200@@ 8 , I had the opport@@ unity to trav@@ el to B@@ er@@ l@@ in , Ger@@ many , for an art@@ ist re@@ si@@ den@@ cy there ."
"P@@ ri@@ or to this time , I had been working as a pain@@ ter ."
"D@@ uring this sum@@ mer , I vis@@ ited different mu@@ se@@ um@@ s and g@@ all@@ ery sp@@ ac@@ es , and as I went from one place to the next , I not@@ ic@@ ed there was no vis@@ ual art there ."
"A@@ t that time , sound was tr@@ en@@ ding , and this stru@@ ck me ..@@ ."
"@@ there was no vis@@ ual art , everything was au@@ dit@@ ory ."
Now sound has come into my art ter@@ rit@@ ory .
I@@ s it going to f@@ ur@@ ther di@@ stance me from art ?
I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
I actually know sound .
I know it so well that it doesn &apos;t have to be something just experi@@ en@@ ced through the ear@@ s .
"It could be felt ta@@ c@@ tually , or experi@@ en@@ ced as a vis@@ ual , or even as an idea ."
So I decided to rec@@ la@@ im ow@@ ner@@ ship of sound and to put it into my art pra@@ cti@@ ce .
"And everything that I had been ta@@ u@@ ght reg@@ ar@@ ding sound , I decided to do away with and un@@ learn ."
I started cre@@ ating a new body of work .
"And when I pres@@ ented this to the art community , I was blo@@ wn away with the amount of sup@@ port and atten@@ tion I rec@@ ei@@ ved ."
"I realized : sound is like money , power , control — social cur@@ ren@@ cy ."
"In the back of my mind , I &apos;ve always felt that sound was your thing , a hear@@ ing person &apos;s thing ."
"And sound is so powerful that it could ei@@ ther di@@ sem@@ power me and my art@@ work , or it could em@@ power me ."
I ch@@ ose to be em@@ power@@ ed .
There &apos;s a mas@@ sive culture around spo@@ k@@ en language .
"And just because I don &apos;t use my liter@@ al vo@@ ice to communic@@ ate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a vo@@ ice at all ."
So I need to work with individu@@ als who can sup@@ port me as an equ@@ al and become my vo@@ ice .
"And that way , I &apos;m able to ma@@ in@@ tain re@@ lev@@ an@@ cy in society today ."
"So at school , at work and instit@@ utions , I work with many different A@@ S@@ L inter@@ pre@@ ters ."
And their vo@@ ice be@@ comes my vo@@ ice and id@@ ent@@ ity .
They help me to be heard .
And their vo@@ ices h@@ old val@@ ue and cur@@ ren@@ cy .
"I@@ ro@@ ni@@ cally , by bor@@ ro@@ wing out their vo@@ ices , I &apos;m able to ma@@ in@@ tain a tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry form of cur@@ ren@@ cy , kind of like taking out a lo@@ an with a very high inter@@ est rate ."
"If I didn &apos;t contin@@ ue this pra@@ cti@@ ce , I feel that I could just fa@@ de off into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on and not ma@@ in@@ tain any form of social cur@@ ren@@ cy ."
"So with sound as my new art medi@@ um , I del@@ ved into the world of music ."
And I was surpri@@ sed to see the si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ities between music and A@@ S@@ L .
"For example , a mu@@ si@@ cal not@@ e can@@ not be fully cap@@ tu@@ red and ex@@ pres@@ sed on pa@@ per ."
And the same hol@@ ds true for a conc@@ ept in A@@ S@@ L .
They &apos;re both high@@ ly sp@@ ati@@ al and high@@ ly inf@@ le@@ cted — me@@ an@@ ing that sub@@ tle changes can aff@@ ect the entire me@@ an@@ ing of both sig@@ ns and s@@ oun@@ ds .
"I &apos;d like to share with you a pi@@ ano met@@ ap@@ h@@ or , to have you have a better under@@ standing of how A@@ S@@ L works ."
"So , envi@@ sion a pi@@ ano ."
A@@ S@@ L is bro@@ k@@ en down into many different gra@@ m@@ m@@ ati@@ cal para@@ met@@ ers .
"If you as@@ sig@@ n a different para@@ met@@ er to each fin@@ ger as you play the pi@@ ano — such as fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sion , body movement , spe@@ ed , hand sh@@ ape and so on , as you play the pi@@ ano — En@@ gli@@ sh is a lin@@ e@@ ar language , as if one key is being pres@@ sed at a time ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , A@@ S@@ L is more like a ch@@ or@@ d — all 10 fin@@ g@@ ers need to come down sim@@ ul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously to ex@@ pres@@ s a clear conc@@ ept or idea in A@@ S@@ L ."
"If just one of those ke@@ ys were to change the ch@@ or@@ d , it would create a completely different me@@ an@@ ing ."
"The same app@@ li@@ es to music in reg@@ ar@@ ds to pit@@ ch , t@@ one and vol@@ u@@ me ."
"In A@@ S@@ L , by pla@@ ying around with these different gra@@ m@@ m@@ ati@@ cal para@@ met@@ ers , you can ex@@ pres@@ s different ideas ."
"For example , take the sig@@ n T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T ."
This is the sig@@ n T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T .
I &apos;m looking at you .
S@@ tar@@ ing at you .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Oh — bu@@ st@@ ed . ( Laughter )
U@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h .
What are you looking at ?
"A@@ w , stop ."
"( Laughter ) I then started thinking , &quot; What if I was to look at A@@ S@@ L through a mu@@ si@@ cal len@@ s ? &quot;"
"If I was to create a sig@@ n and re@@ pe@@ at it over and over , it could become like a piece of vis@@ ual music ."
"For example , this is the sig@@ n for &quot; &quot; day , &quot; &quot; as the su@@ n ri@@ ses and s@@ ets ."
"This is &quot; &quot; all day . &quot; &quot; If I was to re@@ pe@@ at it and s@@ low it down , vis@@ u@@ ally it looks like a piece of music ."
All ... day .
I feel the same hol@@ ds true for &quot; &quot; all night . &quot; &quot; &quot; All night . &quot;
"This is A@@ L@@ L@@ -@@ N@@ I@@ G@@ H@@ T , re@@ pres@@ ented in this dra@@ wing ."
"And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of ni@@ ghts : &quot; last night , &quot; &quot; over@@ night , &quot; ( S@@ ings ) &quot; &quot; all night long . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I feel like the third one has a lot more mu@@ si@@ c@@ ality than the other two . ( Laughter )"
This re@@ pres@@ ents how time is ex@@ pres@@ sed in A@@ S@@ L and how the di@@ stance from your body can ex@@ pres@@ s the changes in time .
"For example , 1@@ H is one hand , 2@@ H is two hand , present ten@@ se happens clo@@ s@@ est and in front of the body , future is in front of the body and the past is to your back ."
"So , the first example is &quot; &quot; a long time ago . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en &quot; &quot; past , &quot; &quot; &quot; used to &quot; and the last one , which is my fav@@ or@@ ite , with the very ro@@ man@@ ti@@ c and dra@@ m@@ atic not@@ ion to it , &quot; once u@@ po@@ n a time . &quot;"
( Laughter ) &quot; C@@ om@@ mon time &quot; is a mu@@ si@@ cal ter@@ m with a speci@@ fic time sig@@ nature of four be@@ ats per meas@@ ure .
"@@ Y@@ et when I see the word &quot; &quot; common time , &quot; &quot; what au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally comes to mind for me is &quot; &quot; at the same time . &quot; &quot; So not@@ ice R@@ H : right hand , L@@ H : left hand ."
We have the st@@ af@@ f across the head and the ches@@ t .
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body , hands up ."
"Now we &apos;re going to do it in both the head and the ches@@ t , kind of like &quot; &quot; common time &quot; &quot; or at the same time ."
"@@ Y@@ es , got it ."
That means &quot; &quot; to f@@ all in love &quot; &quot; in Inter@@ national &#91; S@@ ig@@ n &#93; .
"( Laughter ) Inter@@ national &#91; S@@ ig@@ n &#93; , as a not@@ e , is a vis@@ ual to@@ ol to help communic@@ ate across cul@@ tures and sig@@ n langu@@ ages around the world ."
The second one I &apos;d like to demon@@ str@@ ate is this — ple@@ ase fol@@ low along with me again .
And now this .
This is &quot; &quot; col@@ on@@ iz@@ ation &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
( Laughter ) Now the third — ple@@ ase fol@@ low along again .
And again .
This is &quot; &quot; en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
So let &apos;s do all three together .
"&quot; F@@ all in love , &quot; &quot; col@@ on@@ iz@@ ation &quot; and &quot; &quot; en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot; &quot; Go@@ od job , everyone ."
"( Laughter ) N@@ ot@@ ice how all three sig@@ ns are very si@@ mil@@ ar , they all happen at the head and the ches@@ t , but they con@@ v@@ ey quite different me@@ an@@ ings ."
"So it &apos;s amazing to see how A@@ S@@ L is ali@@ ve and th@@ ri@@ ving , just like music is ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , in this day and age , we live in a very audi@@ o-@@ cent@@ ri@@ c world ."
"And just because A@@ S@@ L has no sound to it , it au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally hol@@ ds no social cur@@ ren@@ cy ."
We need to start thinking har@@ der about what de@@ fin@@ es social cur@@ ren@@ cy and al@@ low A@@ S@@ L to devel@@ op its own form of cur@@ ren@@ cy — without sound .
And this could pos@@ si@@ bly be a step to le@@ ad to a more inclu@@ sive society .
"And maybe people will understand that you don &apos;t need to be de@@ a@@ f to learn A@@ S@@ L , no@@ r do you have to be hear@@ ing to learn music ."
A@@ S@@ L is such a ri@@ ch tre@@ as@@ ure that I &apos;d like you to have the same experience .
"And I &apos;d like to inv@@ ite you to open your ear@@ s , to open your eyes , take part in our culture and experience our vis@@ ual language ."
"And you never know , you might just f@@ all in love with us ."
( Applause ) Thank you .
"D@@ eni@@ se Ka@@ h@@ l@@ er@@ -@@ B@@ ra@@ at@@ en : H@@ ey , that &apos;s me ."
( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ ro C@@ or@@ por@@ ation of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of plast@@ ic with a R@@ a@@ di@@ o Sh@@ ack an@@ ten@@ na atta@@ ched to it .
So that &apos;s just a fu@@ n little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ or@@ t of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing comp@@ ati@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a B@@ u@@ ick hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ al@@ il@@ e@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his tel@@ es@@ c@@ op@@ e to S@@ at@@ ur@@ n ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the side of a glas@@ s win@@ do@@ w in S@@ a@@ o P@@ au@@ lo .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
"H@@ ere &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the back@@ side , which they started to wi@@ pe off ."
I was born and ra@@ is@@ ed in Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a .
"A@@ l@@ though my family con@@ stan@@ tly stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ed against pover@@ ty , I was always lov@@ ed and ca@@ red for first , because I was the only son and the youn@@ g@@ est of two in the family ."
But then the great fam@@ ine beg@@ an in 199@@ 4 .
I was four years old .
My sist@@ er and I would go sear@@ ching for fi@@ re@@ wo@@ od star@@ ting at 5 in the mor@@ ning and come back after mid@@ night .
"I would wan@@ der the stre@@ ets sear@@ ching for food , and I remember seeing a small child ti@@ ed to a mother &apos;s back e@@ ating chi@@ ps , and wan@@ ting to ste@@ al them from him ."
H@@ un@@ ger is hum@@ ili@@ ation . H@@ un@@ ger is ho@@ p@@ el@@ es@@ sn@@ ess .
"For a hun@@ g@@ ry child , polit@@ ics and fre@@ e@@ dom are not even thought of ."
"On my n@@ in@@ th bir@@ th@@ day , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to e@@ at ."
"But even as a child , I could feel the he@@ av@@ in@@ ess in their hear@@ ts ."
"O@@ ver a million Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ ans di@@ ed of star@@ v@@ ation in that time , and in 200@@ 3 , when I was 1@@ 3 years old , my father became one of them ."
I saw my father wi@@ ther away and die .
"In the same year , my mother dis@@ appe@@ a@@ red one day , and then my sist@@ er told me that she was going to China to ear@@ n money , but that she would re@@ turn with money and food so@@ on ."
"S@@ in@@ ce we had never been se@@ par@@ ated , and I thought we would be together fore@@ ver , I didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g when she left ."
It was the bi@@ gg@@ est mi@@ sta@@ ke I have ever made in my life .
"But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long go@@ od@@ by@@ e ."
I have not seen my mom or my sist@@ er since then .
"S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly , I became an or@@ ph@@ an and hom@@ el@@ ess ."
"My da@@ ily life became very hard , but very simple ."
My go@@ al was to find a du@@ st@@ y piece of bre@@ ad in the t@@ ras@@ h .
But that is no way to survi@@ ve .
"I started to realiz@@ e , beg@@ ging would not be the solution ."
So I started to ste@@ al from food car@@ ts in il@@ leg@@ al mark@@ ets .
"S@@ omet@@ imes , I found small j@@ ob@@ s in ex@@ change for food ."
"O@@ n@@ ce , I even sp@@ ent two months in the win@@ ter working in a co@@ al m@@ ine , 3@@ 3 met@@ ers under@@ ground without any prote@@ ction for up to 1@@ 6 hours a day ."
I was not un@@ common .
"M@@ any other or@@ ph@@ ans survi@@ ved this way , or wor@@ se ."
"When I could not f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep from b@@ it@@ ter c@@ old or hun@@ ger pa@@ ins , I ho@@ ped that , the next mor@@ ning , my sist@@ er would come back to wa@@ ke me up with my fav@@ or@@ ite food ."
That hope k@@ ept me ali@@ ve .
"I don &apos;t mean big , gr@@ and hope ."
"I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next t@@ ras@@ h can had bre@@ ad , even though it u@@ su@@ ally didn &apos;t ."
"But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die ."
H@@ op@@ e k@@ ept me ali@@ ve .
"E@@ very day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live ."
"A@@ f@@ ter three years of wa@@ iting for my sist@@ er &apos;s re@@ turn , I decided to go to China to look for her myself ."
I realized I couldn &apos;t survi@@ ve much longer this way .
"I knew the jour@@ ney would be ri@@ sk@@ y , but I would be ris@@ king my life ei@@ ther way ."
"I could die of star@@ v@@ ation like my father in Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , or at least I could try for a better life by es@@ cap@@ ing to China ."
I had learned that many people tri@@ ed to c@@ ross the bor@@ der to China in the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time to av@@ o@@ id being seen .
Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ an bor@@ der gu@@ ar@@ ds often sho@@ ot and k@@ ill people trying to c@@ ross the bor@@ der without per@@ mis@@ sion .
"Ch@@ in@@ ese sol@@ di@@ ers will cat@@ ch and sen@@ d back Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ ans , where they face se@@ v@@ ere pu@@ ni@@ sh@@ ment ."
"I decided to c@@ ross during the day , first because I was still a ki@@ d and sc@@ a@@ red of the dar@@ k , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tri@@ ed to c@@ ross during the day , I thought I might be able to c@@ ross without being seen by any@@ one ."
"I made it to China on F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary 15 , 200@@ 6 ."
I was 1@@ 6 years old .
"I thought things in China would be e@@ a@@ si@@ er , since there was more food ."
I thought more people would help me .
"But it was har@@ der than living in Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , because I was not free ."
I was always wor@@ ri@@ ed about being cau@@ ght and s@@ ent back .
"B@@ y a mi@@ ra@@ cle , some months later , I met someone who was ru@@ n@@ ning an under@@ ground sh@@ el@@ ter for Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ ans , and was allo@@ wed to live there and e@@ at regul@@ ar me@@ als for the first time in many years ."
"L@@ ater that year , an activ@@ ist hel@@ ped me es@@ cap@@ e China and go to the United States as a re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee ."
"I went to America without kno@@ wing a word of En@@ gli@@ sh , yet my social work@@ er told me that I had to go to high school ."
"E@@ ven in Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , I was an F stud@@ ent ."
( Laughter ) And I b@@ are@@ ly fin@@ ish@@ ed ele@@ men@@ t@@ ary school .
And I remember I f@@ ou@@ ght in school more than once a day .
T@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ oks and the li@@ bra@@ ry were not my pla@@ y@@ ground .
"My father tri@@ ed very hard to mot@@ iv@@ ate me into stud@@ ying , but it didn &apos;t work ."
"A@@ t one point , my father gave up on me ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son any@@ more . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it h@@ ur@@ t me de@@ e@@ ply ."
"But ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , my level of mot@@ iv@@ ation still didn &apos;t change before he di@@ ed ."
"So in America , it was kind of ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous that they said I should go to high school ."
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
"I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much ."
"But one day , I came home and my fo@@ ster mother had made ch@@ ick@@ en w@@ ings for din@@ ner ."
"And during din@@ ner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it ."
"When I looked down at my pl@@ ate , I saw the last ch@@ ick@@ en wing , that my fo@@ ster father had given me his ."
I was so happy .
I looked at him sit@@ ting next to me .
"He just looked back at me very war@@ m@@ ly , but said no words ."
S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly I rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed my biolog@@ ical father .
"My fo@@ ster father &apos;s small act of love rem@@ in@@ ded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hun@@ g@@ ry , even if he was star@@ ving ."
"I felt so su@@ ff@@ oc@@ ated that I had so much food in America , yet my father di@@ ed of star@@ v@@ ation ."
"My only w@@ ish that night was to co@@ ok a me@@ al for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to ho@@ no@@ r him ."
And my answer was to pro@@ mi@@ se to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to ho@@ no@@ r his s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice .
"I took school seri@@ ously , and for the first time ever in my life , I rec@@ ei@@ ved an ac@@ a@@ de@@ mic a@@ ward for exc@@ ell@@ ence , and made de@@ an &apos;s li@@ st from the first se@@ mest@@ er in high school ."
( Applause ) That ch@@ ick@@ en wing changed my life .
( Laughter ) H@@ op@@ e is pers@@ onal . H@@ op@@ e is something that no one can give to you .
You have to cho@@ ose to believe in hope .
You have to make it y@@ ourself .
"In Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , I made it myself ."
H@@ op@@ e b@@ rou@@ ght me to America .
"But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"My fo@@ ster father at that din@@ ner gave me a direc@@ tion , and he mot@@ iv@@ ated me and gave me a pur@@ pose to live in America ."
I did not come here by myself .
"I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough ."
M@@ any people hel@@ ped me along the way to get here .
Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ ans are fi@@ gh@@ ting hard to survi@@ ve .
"They have to for@@ ce themselves to survi@@ ve , have hope to survi@@ ve , but they can@@ not make it without help ."
This is my mes@@ sage to you .
"H@@ ave hope for y@@ ourself , but also help each other ."
"L@@ i@@ fe can be hard for everyone , wh@@ er@@ ever you live ."
My fo@@ ster father didn &apos;t in@@ t@@ end to change my life .
"In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the sm@@ all@@ est act of love ."
"A piece of bre@@ ad can s@@ at@@ is@@ fy your hun@@ ger , and having the hope will bring you bre@@ ad to keep you ali@@ ve ."
But I con@@ fi@@ d@@ ently believe that your act of love and car@@ ing can also s@@ ave another J@@ o@@ se@@ ph &apos;s life and change thousands of other J@@ o@@ se@@ ph@@ s who are still having hope to survi@@ ve .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) A@@ dri@@ an H@@ ong : J@@ o@@ se@@ ph , th@@ ank you for shar@@ ing that very pers@@ onal and speci@@ al story with us ."
"I know you hav@@ en &apos;t seen your sist@@ er for , you said , it was almost exactly a de@@ ca@@ de , and in the off chan@@ ce that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opport@@ unity to sen@@ d her a mes@@ sage ."

"I just wanted to say that I mis@@ s you , and I love you , and ple@@ ase come back to me and st@@ ay ali@@ ve ."
"And I — o@@ h , go@@ sh ."
I still hav@@ en &apos;t given up my hope to see you .

"( Laughter ) Y@@ es , I &apos;m just looking for@@ ward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day ."
And can I also make a small mes@@ sage to my mom ?
"A@@ H : S@@ ure , ple@@ ase ."
"@@ J@@ K : I hav@@ en &apos;t sp@@ ent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pra@@ y for me and think about me ."
I just wanted to say th@@ ank you for let@@ ting me be in this world .
Thank you .
( Applause )
How many of you had to f@@ ill out some sort of we@@ b form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a dist@@ or@@ ted sequ@@ ence of charac@@ ters like this ?
"H@@ ow many of you found it really , really an@@ no@@ ying ?"
"O@@ kay , out@@ standing . So I inv@@ ented that ."
( Laughter ) O@@ r I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
"And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the ent@@ ity f@@ ill@@ ing out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer progra@@ m that was writ@@ ten to sub@@ m@@ it the form milli@@ ons and milli@@ ons of times ."
"The reason it works is because humans , at least no@@ n-@@ vis@@ u@@ all@@ y-@@ im@@ pa@@ i@@ red humans , have no t@@ rou@@ ble read@@ ing these dist@@ or@@ ted squ@@ ig@@ g@@ ly charac@@ ters , wh@@ ere@@ as computer progra@@ ms simply can &apos;t do it as well yet ."
"So for example , in the case of T@@ ick@@ et@@ ma@@ ster , the reason you have to ty@@ pe these dist@@ or@@ ted charac@@ ters is to prev@@ ent sc@@ al@@ per@@ s from writ@@ ing a progra@@ m that can bu@@ y milli@@ ons of ti@@ ck@@ ets , two at a time ."
C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are used all over the Internet .
"And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the pre@@ ci@@ se sequ@@ ence of ran@@ dom charac@@ ters that is sho@@ wn to the us@@ er is not so for@@ tun@@ ate ."
So this is an example from the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o regi@@ str@@ ation p@@ age .
"The ran@@ dom charac@@ ters that happened to be sho@@ wn to the us@@ er were W , A , I , T , which , of course , sp@@ ell a word ."
But the best part is the mes@@ sage that the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o help des@@ k got about 20 minutes later .
"T@@ ex@@ t : &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ p ! I &apos;ve been wa@@ iting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wa@@ it ."
"This of course , is not as bad as this po@@ or person ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A Pro@@ ject is something that we did here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gie M@@ ell@@ l@@ on over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used every@@ where ."
"L@@ et me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evol@@ ution of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"This is a project that we call re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , which is something that we started here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gie M@@ ell@@ on , then we turned it into a star@@ tu@@ p company ."
"And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually ac@@ qui@@ red this company ."
So let me tell you what this project started .
So this project started from the fol@@ lo@@ wing realiz@@ ation : It turns out that appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately 2@@ 00 million C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are ty@@ ped every@@ day by people around the world .
"When I first heard this , I was quite pro@@ u@@ d of myself ."
"I thought , look at the imp@@ act that my research has had ."
But then I started feel@@ ing bad .
"S@@ ee here &apos;s the thing , each time you ty@@ pe a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally you w@@ ast@@ e 10 secon@@ ds of your time ."
"And if you mul@@ ti@@ ply that by 2@@ 00 million , you get that hum@@ an@@ ity as a whole is w@@ ast@@ ing about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 hours every day ty@@ ping these an@@ no@@ ying C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s ."
So then I started feel@@ ing bad .
"( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get ri@@ d of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s , because the se@@ cur@@ ity of the W@@ e@@ b sort of de@@ pen@@ ds on them ."
"But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this ef@@ for@@ t for something that is good for hum@@ an@@ ity ?"
"So see , here &apos;s the thing ."
"Wh@@ ile you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , during those 10 secon@@ ds , your brain is doing something amazing ."
Y@@ our brain is doing something that compu@@ ters can@@ not yet do .
So can we get you to do u@@ se@@ ful work for those 10 secon@@ ds ?
"A@@ no@@ ther way of put@@ ting it is , is there some hum@@ on@@ g@@ ous problem that we can@@ not yet get compu@@ ters to sol@@ ve , yet we can sp@@ li@@ t into tiny 1@@ 0-@@ second ch@@ un@@ ks such that each time somebody sol@@ ves a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A they sol@@ ve a little bit of this problem ?"
"And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now ."
"So what you may not know is that no@@ wa@@ days while you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , not only are you au@@ th@@ enti@@ c@@ ating y@@ ourself as a human , but in add@@ ition you &apos;re actually hel@@ ping us to dig@@ it@@ ize bo@@ oks ."
So let me expla@@ in how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of pro@@ jects out there trying to dig@@ it@@ ize bo@@ oks .
Google has one . The Internet Ar@@ chi@@ ve has one .
"A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , now with the K@@ in@@ dle , is trying to dig@@ it@@ ize bo@@ oks ."
B@@ a@@ sically the way this works is you start with an old book .
"You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? L@@ ike a book ?"
"( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you s@@ can it ."
Now sc@@ an@@ ning a book is like taking a dig@@ ital photogra@@ ph of every p@@ age of the book .
It gi@@ ves you an image for every p@@ age of the book .
This is an image with text for every p@@ age of the book .
The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to deci@@ ph@@ er all of the words in this image .
"That &apos;s using a technology called O@@ C@@ R , for op@@ ti@@ cal charac@@ ter recog@@ n@@ ition , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there ."
Now the problem is that O@@ C@@ R is not perf@@ ect .
"E@@ speci@@ ally for ol@@ der bo@@ oks where the in@@ k has f@@ ad@@ ed and the p@@ ages have turned y@@ el@@ low , O@@ C@@ R can@@ not recogniz@@ e a lot of the words ."
"For example , for things that were writ@@ ten more than 50 years ago , the computer can@@ not recogniz@@ e about 30 percent of the words ."
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer can@@ not recogniz@@ e and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A on the Internet .
"So the next time you ty@@ pe a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , these words that you &apos;re ty@@ ping are actually words that are coming from bo@@ oks that are being dig@@ it@@ iz@@ ed that the computer could not recogniz@@ e ."
"And now the reason we have two words no@@ wa@@ days instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you ."
"But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it can@@ not gra@@ de it for you ."
"So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer ."
"We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , ple@@ ase ty@@ pe both ."
"And if you ty@@ pe the cor@@ rec@@ t word for the one for which the system already kno@@ ws the answer , it as@@ sum@@ es you are human , and it also gets some con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence that you ty@@ ped the other word cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And if we re@@ pe@@ at this process to like 10 different people and all of them ag@@ ree on what the new word is , then we get one more word dig@@ it@@ iz@@ ed acc@@ ur@@ ately ."
So this is how the system works .
"And basically , since we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed it about three or four years ago , a lot of we@@ b@@ sit@@ es have started sw@@ it@@ ching from the old C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people w@@ ast@@ ed their time to the new C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people are hel@@ ping to dig@@ it@@ ize bo@@ oks ."
"So for example , T@@ ick@@ et@@ ma@@ ster ."
"So every time you bu@@ y ti@@ ck@@ ets on T@@ ick@@ et@@ ma@@ ster , you help to dig@@ it@@ ize a book ."
"F@@ ace@@ book : E@@ very time you ad@@ d a friend or po@@ ke somebody , you help to dig@@ it@@ ize a book ."
"T@@ w@@ it@@ ter and about 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 other sit@@ es are all using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"And in fact , the number of sit@@ es that are using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re dig@@ it@@ iz@@ ing per day is really , really large ."
"It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of about two and a half million bo@@ oks a year ."
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people ty@@ ping C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s on the Internet .
"( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , fun@@ ny things can happen ."
And this is es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally true because now we &apos;re gi@@ ving people two ran@@ dom@@ ly cho@@ se@@ n En@@ gli@@ sh words next to each other .
So fun@@ ny things can happen .
"For example , we pres@@ ented this word ."
It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
"But if you present it along with another ran@@ dom@@ ly cho@@ se@@ n word , bad things can happen ."
"So we get this . ( T@@ ex@@ t : bad ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans ) But it &apos;s even wor@@ se , because the particular we@@ b@@ s@@ ite where we sho@@ wed this actually happened to be called The E@@ m@@ bas@@ sy of the K@@ ing@@ dom of G@@ od ."
( Laughter ) O@@ op@@ s . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
J@@ oh@@ n@@ E@@ d@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .@@ c@@ om ( T@@ ex@@ t : D@@ am@@ n li@@ ber@@ al ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on in@@ sul@@ ting people left and right every@@ day .
"Now , of course , we &apos;re not just in@@ sul@@ ting people ."
"S@@ ee here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re pres@@ ent@@ ing two ran@@ dom@@ ly cho@@ se@@ n words , interesting things can happen ."
"So this actually has given ri@@ se to a really big Internet mem@@ e that ten@@ s of thousands of people have parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated in , which is called C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A art ."
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
"I@@ mag@@ ine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A that you think is some@@ what pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , like this C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A . ( T@@ ex@@ t : in@@ vi@@ sible to@@ aster ) Th@@ en what you &apos;re sup@@ posed to do is you take a scre@@ en sh@@ ot of it ."
"Th@@ en of course , you f@@ ill out the C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A because you help us dig@@ it@@ ize a book ."
"But then , first you take a scre@@ en sh@@ ot , and then you dra@@ w something that is rel@@ ated to it ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
There are ten@@ s of thousands of these .
S@@ ome of them are very c@@ ute . ( T@@ ex@@ t : c@@ len@@ ched it ) ( Laughter ) S@@ ome of them are fun@@ ni@@ er .
"( T@@ ex@@ t : st@@ on@@ ed f@@ oun@@ ders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ olog@@ ical sh@@ vis@@ le , they con@@ tain S@@ no@@ op D@@ og@@ g . ( Laughter )"
"O@@ kay , so this is my fav@@ or@@ ite number of re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
So this is the fav@@ or@@ ite thing that I like about this whole project .
"This is the number of dist@@ in@@ ct people that have hel@@ ped us dig@@ it@@ ize at least one word out of a book through re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A : 7@@ 50 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has hel@@ ped us dig@@ it@@ ize human knowled@@ ge ."
And it is num@@ bers like these that mot@@ iv@@ ate my research ag@@ en@@ da .
"So the question that mot@@ i@@ vat@@ es my research is the fol@@ lo@@ wing : If you look at hum@@ an@@ ity &apos;s lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale achi@@ ev@@ e@@ ments , these really big things that hum@@ an@@ ity has got@@ ten together and done hist@@ or@@ ically — like for example , building the py@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds of E@@ g@@ y@@ pt or the P@@ an@@ am@@ a C@@ an@@ al or put@@ ting a man on the Mo@@ on — there is a cu@@ ri@@ ous fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people ."
"It &apos;s we@@ ird ; they were all done with about 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 people ."
"And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , co@@ ordin@@ ating more than 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 people , let alone pa@@ ying them , was es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally im@@ possible ."
"But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just sho@@ wn you a project where we &apos;ve got@@ ten 7@@ 50 million people to help us dig@@ it@@ ize human knowled@@ ge ."
"So the question that mot@@ i@@ vat@@ es my research is , if we can put a man on the Mo@@ on with 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?"
"So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different pro@@ jects that we &apos;ve been working on ."
Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most exc@@ ited about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been se@@ mi@@ -@@ qui@@ et@@ ly working on for the last year and a half or so .
It h@@ asn &apos;t yet been lau@@ n@@ ched . It &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"S@@ in@@ ce it h@@ asn &apos;t been lau@@ n@@ ched , sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h !"
"( Laughter ) Yeah , I can tru@@ st you &apos;ll do that ."
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
"It started with me pos@@ ing a question to my gradu@@ ate stud@@ ent , S@@ ever@@ in H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s S@@ ever@@ in H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
So I posed the question to my gradu@@ ate stud@@ ent .
"B@@ y the way , you did hear me cor@@ rec@@ tly ; his last name is H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people tran@@ sl@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free ?
"O@@ kay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question ."
"F@@ i@@ rst of all , tran@@ sl@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b ."
So right now the W@@ e@@ b is part@@ iti@@ on@@ ed into mul@@ ti@@ ple langu@@ ages .
A large fra@@ ction of it is in En@@ gli@@ sh .
"If you don &apos;t know any En@@ gli@@ sh , you can &apos;t acc@@ ess it ."
"But there &apos;s large fra@@ ctions in other different langu@@ ages , and if you don &apos;t know those langu@@ ages , you can &apos;t acc@@ ess it ."
"So I would like to tran@@ sl@@ ate all of the W@@ e@@ b , or at least most of the W@@ e@@ b , into every maj@@ or language ."
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
"Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use compu@@ ters to tran@@ sl@@ ate ?"
Why can &apos;t we use machine tran@@ sl@@ ation ?
M@@ ach@@ ine tran@@ sl@@ ation no@@ wa@@ days is star@@ ting to tran@@ sl@@ ate some sent@@ ences here and there .
Why can &apos;t we use it to tran@@ sl@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b ?
Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
It makes a lot of mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es .
"E@@ ven when it doesn &apos;t make a mi@@ sta@@ ke , since it makes so many mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es , you don &apos;t know whether to tru@@ st it or not ."
So let me show you an example of something that was tran@@ sl@@ ated with a machine .
A@@ c@@ tually it was a for@@ um pos@@ t .
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt .
It was tran@@ sl@@ ated from J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese into En@@ gli@@ sh .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
This person star@@ ts a@@ polo@@ g@@ iz@@ ing for the fact that it &apos;s tran@@ sl@@ ated with a computer .
So the next sent@@ ence is is going to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to the question .
So he &apos;s just expla@@ ining something .
"R@@ em@@ ember , it &apos;s a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : A@@ t often , the go@@ at@@ -@@ time inst@@ all a er@@ ro@@ r is v@@ om@@ it . ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes the first part of the question ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : How many times like the w@@ ind , a po@@ le , and the dra@@ g@@ on ? ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes my fav@@ or@@ ite part of the question ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : This in@@ sul@@ t to father &apos;s st@@ ones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the en@@ ding , which is my fav@@ or@@ ite part of the whole thing ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : P@@ le@@ ase a@@ polo@@ g@@ ize for your stu@@ pi@@ d@@ ity . There are a many th@@ ank you . ) ( Laughter ) O@@ kay , so computer tran@@ sl@@ ation , not yet good enough ."
So back to the question .
So we need people to tran@@ sl@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b .
"So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just p@@ ay people to do this ?"
We could p@@ ay profes@@ si@@ onal language tran@@ sl@@ at@@ ors to tran@@ sl@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b .
We could do that .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it would be ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
"For example , tran@@ sl@@ ating a tiny , tiny fra@@ ction of the whole W@@ e@@ b , W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a , into one other language , S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a exist@@ s in S@@ pan@@ ish , but it &apos;s very small com@@ pa@@ red to the size of En@@ gli@@ sh ."
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of En@@ gli@@ sh .
"If we wanted to tran@@ sl@@ ate the other 80 percent into S@@ pan@@ ish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most ex@@ plo@@ ited , ou@@ ts@@ our@@ cing country out there ."
So it would be very ex@@ pen@@ sive .
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people tran@@ sl@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free .
"Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realiz@@ e you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big h@@ ur@@ dl@@ es , two big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les ."
The first one is a l@@ ack of bil@@ in@@ gu@@ als .
So I don &apos;t even know if there exist@@ s 100 million people out there using the W@@ e@@ b who are bil@@ in@@ gu@@ al enough to help us tran@@ sl@@ ate .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a l@@ ack of mot@@ iv@@ ation .
How are we going to mot@@ iv@@ ate people to actually tran@@ sl@@ ate the W@@ e@@ b for free ?
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , you have to p@@ ay people to do this ."
So how are we going to mot@@ iv@@ ate them to do it for free ?
"Now when we were star@@ ting to think about this , we were blo@@ c@@ ked by these two things ."
"But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to sol@@ ve both these problems with the same solution ."
There &apos;s a way to k@@ ill two bir@@ ds with one st@@ one .
"And that is to trans@@ form language tran@@ sl@@ ation into something that milli@@ ons of people want to do , and that also hel@@ ps with the problem of l@@ ack of bil@@ in@@ gu@@ als , and that is language education ."
"So it turns out that today , there are over 1@@ .@@ 2 billion people learning a fore@@ ig@@ n language ."
"P@@ eople really , really want to learn a fore@@ ig@@ n language ."
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being for@@ ced to do so in school .
"For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have pa@@ id over $ 500 for so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to learn a new language ."
"So people really , really want to learn a new language ."
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new we@@ b@@ s@@ ite — it &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go — where the ba@@ sic idea is people learn a new language for free while sim@@ ul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously tran@@ sl@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
"So the way this works is wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re a just a beg@@ in@@ ner , we give you very , very simple sent@@ ences ."
"There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sent@@ ences on the W@@ e@@ b ."
"We give you very , very simple sent@@ ences along with what each word means ."
"And as you tran@@ sl@@ ate them , and as you see how other people tran@@ sl@@ ate them , you start learning the language ."
"And as you get more and more adv@@ an@@ ced , we give you more and more complex sent@@ ences to tran@@ sl@@ ate ."
"But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing ."
Now the c@@ raz@@ y thing about this me@@ th@@ od is that it actually really works .
"F@@ i@@ rst of all , people are really , really learning a language ."
"We &apos;re mo@@ st@@ ly done building it , and now we &apos;re test@@ ing it ."
P@@ eople really can learn a language with it .
And they learn it about as well as the le@@ ad@@ ing language learning so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
So people really do learn a language .
"And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting ."
"Because you see with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , people are actually learning with real con@@ t@@ ent ."
"As op@@ posed to learning with ma@@ de@@ -@@ up sent@@ ences , people are learning with real con@@ t@@ ent , which is in@@ her@@ ently interesting ."
So people really do learn a language .
"But perhaps more surpri@@ sing@@ ly , the tran@@ sl@@ ations that we get from people using the s@@ ite , even though they &apos;re just beg@@ in@@ n@@ ers , the tran@@ sl@@ ations that we get are as acc@@ ur@@ ate as those of profes@@ si@@ onal language tran@@ sl@@ at@@ ors , which is very surpri@@ sing ."
So let me show you one example .
This is a sent@@ ence that was tran@@ sl@@ ated from Ger@@ man into En@@ gli@@ sh .
The top is the Ger@@ man .
The middle is an En@@ gli@@ sh tran@@ sl@@ ation that was done by somebody who was a profes@@ si@@ onal En@@ gli@@ sh tran@@ sl@@ ator who we pa@@ id 20 c@@ ents a word for this tran@@ sl@@ ation .
"And the bot@@ tom is a tran@@ sl@@ ation by us@@ ers of D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , no@@ ne of wh@@ om knew any Ger@@ man before they started using the s@@ ite ."
"You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perf@@ ect ."
"Now of course , we play a tri@@ ck here to make the tran@@ sl@@ ations as good as profes@@ si@@ onal language tran@@ sl@@ at@@ ors ."
We com@@ b@@ ine the tran@@ sl@@ ations of mul@@ ti@@ ple beg@@ in@@ n@@ ers to get the qu@@ ality of a single profes@@ si@@ onal tran@@ sl@@ ator .
"Now even though we &apos;re com@@ bin@@ ing the tran@@ sl@@ ations , the s@@ ite actually can tran@@ sl@@ ate pretty f@@ ast ."
"So let me show you , this is our est@@ im@@ ates of how f@@ ast we could tran@@ sl@@ ate W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a from En@@ gli@@ sh into S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"R@@ em@@ ember , this is 50 million dollar@@ s@@ -@@ wor@@ th of val@@ ue ."
"So if we wanted to tran@@ sl@@ ate W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a into S@@ pan@@ ish , we could do it in five we@@ eks with 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 ac@@ tive us@@ ers ."
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million ac@@ tive us@@ ers .
"S@@ in@@ ce all the pro@@ jects that my group has worked on so far have got@@ ten milli@@ ons of us@@ ers , we &apos;re ho@@ pe@@ ful that we &apos;ll be able to tran@@ sl@@ ate ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely f@@ ast with this project ."
Now the thing that I &apos;m most exc@@ ited about with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think this pro@@ vid@@ es a fa@@ ir business model for language education .
"So here &apos;s the thing : The cur@@ r@@ ent business model for language education is the stud@@ ent pa@@ ys , and in particular , the stud@@ ent pa@@ ys R@@ os@@ et@@ ta S@@ t@@ one 500 dollars ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the cur@@ r@@ ent business model .
The problem with this business model is that 9@@ 5 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
So it &apos;s ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely un@@ fa@@ ir to@@ wards the po@@ or .
This is tot@@ ally bi@@ as@@ ed to@@ wards the ri@@ ch .
"Now see , in D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , because while you learn you &apos;re actually cre@@ ating val@@ ue , you &apos;re tran@@ sl@@ ating stuff — which for example , we could ch@@ ar@@ ge somebody for tran@@ sl@@ ations ."
So this is how we could mon@@ et@@ ize this .
"S@@ in@@ ce people are cre@@ ating val@@ ue while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to p@@ ay their money , they p@@ ay with their time ."
"But the mag@@ ical thing here is that they &apos;re pa@@ ying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been sp@@ ent any@@ ways learning the language ."
So the ni@@ ce thing about D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think it pro@@ vid@@ es a fa@@ ir business model — one that doesn &apos;t dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ate against po@@ or people .
So here &apos;s the s@@ ite . Thank you .
( Applause ) So here &apos;s the s@@ ite .
"We hav@@ en &apos;t yet lau@@ n@@ ched , but if you go there , you can sig@@ n up to be part of our priv@@ ate bet@@ a , which is probably going to start in about three or four we@@ eks ."
We hav@@ en &apos;t yet lau@@ n@@ ched this D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"B@@ y the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is the work of a really aw@@ es@@ ome team , some of wh@@ om are here ."
So th@@ ank you .

"In O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , there was a fanta@@ st@@ ic doc@@ tor , who was very un@@ u@@ su@@ al , na@@ med A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ war@@ t ."

The hard problem that A@@ li@@ ce ch@@ ose was the ri@@ sing in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od can@@ c@@ ers .

"And it fle@@ w in the face of doc@@ tors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who hel@@ ped patients , they didn &apos;t har@@ m them ."
"N@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess , A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ war@@ t ru@@ shed to publi@@ sh her pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary fin@@ din@@ gs in The L@@ an@@ c@@ et in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"P@@ eople got very exc@@ ited , there was talk of the N@@ ob@@ el Pri@@ ze , and A@@ li@@ ce really was in a big h@@ ur@@ ry to try to study all the c@@ ases of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od cancer she could find before they dis@@ appe@@ a@@ red ."
"In fact , she need not have h@@ ur@@ ri@@ ed ."
It was fully 25 years before the B@@ rit@@ ish and medi@@ cal — B@@ rit@@ ish and American medi@@ cal est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ments ab@@ an@@ don@@ ed the pra@@ cti@@ ce of X@@ -@@ ra@@ ying pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant women .
"The data was out there , it was open , it was fre@@ ely av@@ ail@@ able , but no@@ body wanted to know ."
"A child a week was d@@ ying , but nothing changed ."
O@@ pen@@ ness alone can &apos;t dri@@ ve change .
So for 25 years A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ war@@ t had a very big fi@@ ght on her hands .
"So , how did she know that she was right ?"
"Well , she had a fanta@@ st@@ ic model for thinking ."
"S@@ he worked with a stati@@ st@@ ici@@ an na@@ med G@@ e@@ or@@ ge K@@ ne@@ ale , and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge was pretty much everything that A@@ li@@ ce wasn &apos;t ."
"So , A@@ li@@ ce was very out@@ going and soci@@ able , and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge was a rec@@ lu@@ se ."
"A@@ li@@ ce was very war@@ m , very em@@ pa@@ th@@ et@@ ic with her patients ."
G@@ e@@ or@@ ge f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly pre@@ fer@@ red num@@ bers to people .
But he said this fanta@@ st@@ ic thing about their working relation@@ ship .
"He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to pro@@ ve D@@ r@@ . S@@ te@@ war@@ t wrong . &quot; &quot; He ac@@ ti@@ vely s@@ ou@@ ght dis@@ con@@ fi@@ r@@ m@@ ation ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent ways of looking at her model@@ s , at her stati@@ st@@ ics , different ways of c@@ ru@@ n@@ ching the data in order to dis@@ pro@@ ve her ."
He saw his job as cre@@ ating conf@@ li@@ ct around her the@@ ories .
"Because it was only by not being able to pro@@ ve that she was wrong , that G@@ e@@ or@@ ge could give A@@ li@@ ce the con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence she needed to know that she was right ."
It &apos;s a fanta@@ st@@ ic model of col@@ labor@@ ation — thinking part@@ n@@ ers who are@@ n &apos;t ech@@ o ch@@ am@@ bers .
"I won@@ der how many of us have , or d@@ are to have , such col@@ laborat@@ ors ."
A@@ li@@ ce and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge were very good at conf@@ li@@ ct .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of con@@ stru@@ ctive conf@@ li@@ ct re@@ qui@@ re ?
"Well , first of all , it re@@ qui@@ res that we find people who are very different from ourselves ."
"That means we have to re@@ si@@ st the ne@@ uro@@ biolog@@ ical dri@@ ve , which means that we really pre@@ f@@ er people mo@@ st@@ ly like ourselves , and it means we have to se@@ ek out people with different back@@ gro@@ un@@ ds , different dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to eng@@ age with them ."
That re@@ qui@@ res a lot of pati@@ ence and a lot of energy .
"And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love ."
Because you simply won &apos;t comm@@ it that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
And it also means that we have to be pre@@ pa@@ red to change our min@@ ds .
"A@@ li@@ ce &apos;s d@@ aughter told me that every time A@@ li@@ ce went he@@ ad@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ head with a fel@@ low sci@@ ent@@ ist , they made her think and think and think again ."
"&quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y a fi@@ ght , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one relation@@ ship ."
"But it stri@@ k@@ es me that the bi@@ gg@@ est problems we face , many of the bi@@ gg@@ est dis@@ ast@@ ers that we &apos;ve experi@@ en@@ ced , mo@@ st@@ ly hav@@ en &apos;t come from individu@@ als , they &apos;ve come from organiz@@ ations , some of them bi@@ g@@ ger than countries , many of them cap@@ able of aff@@ ec@@ ting hun@@ dre@@ ds , thousands , even milli@@ ons of lives ."
So how do organiz@@ ations think ?
"Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t ."
"And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t ."
And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too af@@ ra@@ id of conf@@ li@@ ct .
"In sur@@ ve@@ ys of Euro@@ pe@@ an and American ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ti@@ ves , fully 8@@ 5 percent of them ac@@ knowled@@ g@@ ed that they had issu@@ es or con@@ cer@@ ns at work that they were af@@ ra@@ id to ra@@ ise ."
"A@@ fra@@ id of the conf@@ li@@ ct that that would pro@@ vo@@ ke , af@@ ra@@ id to get em@@ bro@@ il@@ ed in argu@@ ments that they did not know how to man@@ age , and felt that they were b@@ ound to lo@@ se ."
E@@ igh@@ ty@@ -@@ five percent is a really big number .
It means that organiz@@ ations mo@@ st@@ ly can &apos;t do what G@@ e@@ or@@ ge and A@@ li@@ ce so tri@@ um@@ ph@@ an@@ tly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
"And it means that people like many of us , who have run organiz@@ ations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mo@@ st@@ ly fa@@ il to get the best out of them ."
So how do we devel@@ op the sk@@ ill@@ s that we need ?
"Because it does take sk@@ ill and pra@@ cti@@ ce , too ."
"If we are@@ n &apos;t going to be af@@ ra@@ id of conf@@ li@@ ct , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it ."
"So , rec@@ ently , I worked with an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive na@@ med J@@ oe , and J@@ oe worked for a medi@@ cal de@@ vice company ."
And J@@ oe was very wor@@ ri@@ ed about the de@@ vice that he was working on .
He thought that it was too comp@@ lic@@ ated and he thought that its compl@@ ex@@ ity created mar@@ g@@ ins of er@@ ro@@ r that could really h@@ ur@@ t people .
He was af@@ ra@@ id of doing dam@@ age to the patients he was trying to help .
"But when he looked around his organiz@@ ation , no@@ body else se@@ em@@ ed to be at all wor@@ ri@@ ed ."
"So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t ."
Ma@@ ybe he &apos;d look stup@@ id .
"But he k@@ ept wor@@ ry@@ ing about it , and he wor@@ ri@@ ed about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he lov@@ ed ."
"In the end , J@@ oe and I found a way for him to ra@@ ise his con@@ cer@@ ns ."
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situ@@ ation .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts .
So now J@@ oe had al@@ li@@ es . They could think together .
"And yes , there was a lot of conf@@ li@@ ct and de@@ b@@ ate and argu@@ ment , but that allo@@ wed everyone around the table to be cre@@ ative , to sol@@ ve the problem , and to change the de@@ vice ."
"@@ J@@ oe was what a lot of people might think of as a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ -@@ blo@@ wer , exc@@ ept that like almost all wh@@ ist@@ le@@ -@@ blo@@ wers , he wasn &apos;t a c@@ ran@@ k at all , he was pas@@ sion@@ ately dev@@ ot@@ ed to the organiz@@ ation and the high@@ er pur@@ pos@@ es that that organiz@@ ation ser@@ ved ."
"But he had been so af@@ ra@@ id of conf@@ li@@ ct , until finally he became more af@@ ra@@ id of the sil@@ ence ."
"And when he da@@ red to speak , he discover@@ ed much more inside him@@ self and much more give in the system than he had ever imag@@ ined ."
And his colle@@ ag@@ ues don &apos;t think of him as a c@@ ran@@ k .
They think of him as a le@@ ad@@ er .
"So , how do we have these con@@ vers@@ ations more eas@@ ily and more often ?"
"Well , the Uni@@ vers@@ ity of D@@ el@@ ft re@@ qui@@ res that its P@@ h@@ D students have to sub@@ m@@ it five stat@@ e@@ ments that they &apos;re pre@@ pa@@ red to def@@ end ."
"It doesn &apos;t really matter what the stat@@ e@@ ments are about , what mat@@ ters is that the can@@ di@@ dat@@ es are w@@ ill@@ ing and able to stand up to au@@ th@@ or@@ ity ."
"I think it &apos;s a fanta@@ st@@ ic system , but I think le@@ av@@ ing it to P@@ h@@ D can@@ di@@ dat@@ es is far too few people , and way too l@@ ate in life ."
"I think we need to be teach@@ ing these sk@@ ill@@ s to kids and a@@ du@@ l@@ ts at every stage of their develop@@ ment , if we want to have thinking organiz@@ ations and a thinking society ."
The fact is that most of the bi@@ gg@@ est cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es that we &apos;ve w@@ it@@ nes@@ sed ra@@ rely come from information that is se@@ cre@@ t or h@@ id@@ den .
"It comes from information that is fre@@ ely av@@ ail@@ able and out there , but that we are w@@ ill@@ fully bl@@ ind to , because we can &apos;t han@@ dle , don &apos;t want to han@@ dle , the conf@@ li@@ ct that it pro@@ vo@@ k@@ es ."
"But when we d@@ are to bre@@ ak that sil@@ ence , or when we d@@ are to see , and we create conf@@ li@@ ct , we en@@ able ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking ."
"O@@ p@@ en information is fanta@@ st@@ ic , open net@@ works are es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al ."
But the tru@@ th won &apos;t set us free until we devel@@ op the sk@@ ill@@ s and the h@@ ab@@ it and the tal@@ ent and the mor@@ al cou@@ ra@@ ge to use it .
O@@ pen@@ ness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .

"T@@ w@@ o years ago , I sto@@ od on the TED stage in A@@ rush@@ a , T@@ an@@ z@@ ani@@ a ."
I spo@@ ke very bri@@ ef@@ ly about one of my pro@@ ud@@ est cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
"B@@ e@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in M@@ al@@ aw@@ i ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
"On the stage that day , I was so ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"My En@@ gli@@ sh lost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by so many az@@ un@@ gu , white people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feel@@ ing good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have se@@ ven children in my family .
"A@@ ll sist@@ ers , exc@@ ep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my da@@ d when I was a little bo@@ y .
"B@@ e@@ fore I discover@@ ed the won@@ ders of science , I was just a simple far@@ mer in a country of po@@ or far@@ mer@@ s ."
"L@@ ike everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ ize ."
One year our for@@ tu@@ ne turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we experi@@ en@@ ced an aw@@ ful fam@@ ine .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five months all M@@ al@@ a@@ wi@@ ans beg@@ an to star@@ ve to de@@ ath .
"My family ate one me@@ al per day , at night ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ si@@ ma for each one of us .
The food pas@@ ses through our bod@@ ies .
We dro@@ p down to nothing .
"In M@@ al@@ aw@@ i , the secon@@ d@@ ary school , you have to p@@ ay school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the hun@@ ger , I was for@@ ced to dro@@ p out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t acc@@ ept .
"I felt very happy to be at the secon@@ d@@ ary school , so I was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to rec@@ ei@@ ve education ."
So I went to a li@@ bra@@ ry .
"I read bo@@ oks , science bo@@ oks , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally physi@@ cs ."
I couldn &apos;t read En@@ gli@@ sh that well .
I used diag@@ ra@@ ms and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that knowled@@ ge in my hands .
It said a win@@ d@@ m@@ ill could p@@ um@@ p water and gener@@ ate electri@@ city .
"P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , a def@@ en@@ se against hun@@ ger , which we were experi@@ en@@ cing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one win@@ d@@ m@@ ill for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a sc@@ ra@@ p y@@ ard where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , inclu@@ ding my mother , said I was c@@ raz@@ y ."

"U@@ sing a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle fra@@ me and an old b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle dy@@ na@@ mo , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four li@@ ghts , with sw@@ it@@ ch@@ es , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it bre@@ ak@@ er , model@@ ed after an electri@@ c b@@ ell ."
A@@ no@@ ther machine p@@ um@@ ps water for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .

I had never seen an air@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never sle@@ pt in a hotel .
"So , on stage that day in A@@ rush@@ a , my En@@ gli@@ sh lost , I said something like , &quot; I tri@@ ed . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Afri@@ c@@ ans , and the po@@ or who are stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with your dre@@ am@@ s ."

"In the 19@@ 8@@ 0s in the comm@@ un@@ ist E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Ger@@ many , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government ."
You had to regi@@ ster a sam@@ ple she@@ et of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er .
And this was done so the government could tra@@ ck where text was coming from .
"If they found a pa@@ per which had the wrong kind of thought , they could tra@@ ck down who created that thought ."
"And we in the W@@ est couldn &apos;t understand how any@@ body could do this , how much this would re@@ stri@@ ct fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ ec@@ h ."
We would never do that in our own countries .
"But today in 20@@ 11 , if you go and bu@@ y a col@@ or l@@ as@@ er prin@@ ter from any maj@@ or l@@ as@@ er prin@@ ter man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ re@@ r and prin@@ t a p@@ age , that p@@ age will end up having sli@@ ght y@@ el@@ low d@@ ots prin@@ ted on every single p@@ age in a patter@@ n which makes the p@@ age uni@@ qu@@ e to you and to your prin@@ ter ."
This is happening to us today .
And no@@ body se@@ ems to be making a f@@ us@@ s about it .
"And this is an example of the ways that our own govern@@ ments are using technology against us , the c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens ."
And this is one of the ma@@ in three sour@@ ces of on@@ line problems today .
"If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the on@@ line world , we can group the atta@@ cks based on the atta@@ ck@@ ers ."
We have three ma@@ in grou@@ ps .
We have on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als .
"L@@ ike here , we have M@@ r@@ . D@@ im@@ it@@ ry G@@ ol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of K@@ i@@ ev in U@@ kra@@ ine ."
And the mot@@ i@@ ves of on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
"They use on@@ line atta@@ cks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it ."
"We actually have sever@@ al c@@ ases of milli@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ res on@@ line , mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ res , who made money with their atta@@ cks ."
Here &apos;s V@@ lad@@ im@@ ir T@@ sa@@ st@@ s@@ in form T@@ ar@@ tu in E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z .
This is S@@ te@@ ph@@ en W@@ at@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ d@@ in .
"This is M@@ at@@ the@@ w An@@ der@@ son , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ D@@ a@@ our and so on and so on ."
"Th@@ ese guys make their for@@ tun@@ es on@@ line , but they make it through the il@@ leg@@ al means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts while we do on@@ line ban@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers to colle@@ ct our cre@@ dit c@@ ard information while we are doing on@@ line sh@@ op@@ ping from an inf@@ ec@@ ted computer ."
"The U.@@ S. S@@ ec@@ re@@ t S@@ er@@ vice , two months ago , f@@ ro@@ ze the S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t of M@@ r@@ . S@@ am J@@ a@@ in right here , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.@@ S. dollars on it when it was f@@ ro@@ z@@ en ."
M@@ r@@ . J@@ a@@ in him@@ self is on the lo@@ ose ; no@@ body kno@@ ws where he is .
And I c@@ la@@ im it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more lik@@ ely for any of us to become the vi@@ cti@@ m of a cri@@ me on@@ line than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvi@@ ous that this is only going to get wor@@ se .
"In the future , the maj@@ or@@ ity of cri@@ me will be happening on@@ line ."
The second maj@@ or group of atta@@ ck@@ ers that we are wat@@ ching today are not mot@@ iv@@ ated by money .
"They &apos;re mot@@ iv@@ ated by something else — mot@@ iv@@ ated by pro@@ test@@ s , mot@@ iv@@ ated by an op@@ in@@ ion , mot@@ iv@@ ated by the l@@ augh@@ s ."
G@@ rou@@ ps like A@@ no@@ ny@@ m@@ ous have ri@@ se@@ n up over the last 12 months and have become a maj@@ or pla@@ y@@ er in the fiel@@ d of on@@ line atta@@ cks .
"So those are the three ma@@ in atta@@ ck@@ ers : cri@@ min@@ als who do it for the money , h@@ ac@@ kti@@ vi@@ sts like A@@ no@@ ny@@ m@@ ous doing it for the pro@@ test , but then the last group are n@@ ation stat@@ es , govern@@ ments doing the atta@@ cks ."
And then we look at c@@ ases like what happened in D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a pri@@ me example of what happens when govern@@ ments atta@@ ck against their own c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens .
"D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate A@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity from The Ne@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds — or actually , it was ."
It was ru@@ n@@ ning into ban@@ kru@@ pt@@ cy last f@@ all because they were h@@ ac@@ ked into .
S@@ om@@ e@@ body bro@@ ke in and they h@@ ac@@ ked it th@@ o@@ rou@@ gh@@ ly .
"And I asked last week in a me@@ et@@ ing with D@@ ut@@ ch government re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ati@@ ves , I asked one of the lea@@ ders of the team whether he found pl@@ au@@ sible that people di@@ ed because of the D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar h@@ ack ."
And his answer was yes .
So how do people die as the resul@@ t of a h@@ ack like this ?
Well D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .@@ A@@ .
They s@@ ell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
"Well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite that has h@@ t@@ t@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted ser@@ vi@@ ces , ser@@ vi@@ ces like G@@ ma@@ il ."
"Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ ma@@ il or one of their comp@@ et@@ it@@ ors , but these ser@@ vi@@ ces are es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally popul@@ ar in tot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an stat@@ es like I@@ ran , where dis@@ sid@@ ents use fore@@ ig@@ n ser@@ vi@@ ces like G@@ ma@@ il because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local ser@@ vi@@ ces and they are en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L conne@@ ctions , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their disc@@ us@@ sions ."
E@@ x@@ c@@ ept they can if they h@@ ack into a fore@@ ig@@ n C@@ .@@ A@@ .
and issue ro@@ gu@@ e cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
"What about A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt ?"
"Well in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of the E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an se@@ cre@@ t poli@@ ce in A@@ pri@@ l 20@@ 11 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of pa@@ per@@ s ."
"A@@ mon@@ g those pa@@ per@@ s , was this bin@@ der ent@@ it@@ led &quot; &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And within that bin@@ der were not@@ es from a company based in Ger@@ many which had sol@@ d the E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an government a set of to@@ ols for inter@@ c@@ ep@@ ting — and in very large scale — all the communic@@ ation of the c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens of the country ."
"They had sol@@ d this to@@ ol for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 Euro@@ s to the E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an government ."
The company he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters are right here .
So W@@ ester@@ n govern@@ ments are pro@@ vid@@ ing tot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an govern@@ ments with to@@ ols to do this against their own c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens .
But W@@ ester@@ n govern@@ ments are doing it to themselves as well .
"For example , in Ger@@ many , just a couple of we@@ eks ago the so@@ -@@ called S@@ t@@ ate T@@ ro@@ ja@@ n was found , which was a tro@@ ja@@ n used by Ger@@ man government off@@ ici@@ als to invest@@ ig@@ ate their own c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens ."
"If you are a su@@ spe@@ ct in a cri@@ min@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous , your phone will be ta@@ pped ."
"But today , it goes be@@ y@@ ond that ."
They will ta@@ p your Internet conne@@ ction .
"They will even use to@@ ols like S@@ t@@ ate T@@ ro@@ ja@@ n to inf@@ ect your computer with a tro@@ ja@@ n , which en@@ ab@@ les them to wat@@ ch all your communic@@ ation , to list@@ en to your on@@ line disc@@ us@@ sions , to colle@@ ct your pas@@ s@@ words ."
"Now when we think de@@ ep@@ er about things like these , the obvi@@ ous respon@@ se from people should be that , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , that s@@ oun@@ ds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really aff@@ ect me because I &apos;m a leg@@ al c@@ it@@ iz@@ en ."
Why should I wor@@ ry ?
"Because I have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot; &quot; And this is an argu@@ ment , which doesn &apos;t make sense ."
Pri@@ v@@ ac@@ y is imp@@ li@@ ed .
Pri@@ v@@ ac@@ y is not up for disc@@ us@@ sion .
This is not a question between priv@@ ac@@ y against se@@ cur@@ ity .
It &apos;s a question of fre@@ e@@ dom against control .
"And while we might tru@@ st our govern@@ ments right now , right here in 20@@ 11 , any right we give away will be given away for good ."
"And do we tru@@ st , do we bl@@ in@@ dly tru@@ st , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?"
And these are the questions that we have to wor@@ ry about for the next 50 years .
We re@@ tain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying m@@ un@@ dan@@ e s@@ oun@@ ds .
"This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble d@@ ry@@ er ."
"Now sound is my pas@@ sion , it &apos;s my life ."
( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause ) ( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to speak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ ues .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally under@@ sto@@ od that questions of mor@@ ality — questions of good and e@@ vil and right and wrong — are questions about which science off@@ ici@@ ally has no op@@ in@@ ion ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we val@@ ue , but it can never tell us what we ou@@ ght to val@@ ue ."
"And , con@@ sequ@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ st@@ it@@ ut@@ es a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to argu@@ e that this is an il@@ lu@@ sion — that the se@@ par@@ ation between science and human val@@ ues is an il@@ lu@@ sion — and actually quite a dan@@ ger@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s often said that science can@@ not give us a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ ues se@@ em to bel@@ ong to different sp@@ her@@ es ."
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ p@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ou@@ ght to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ ues are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of consci@@ ous cre@@ at@@ ures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ th@@ ical ob@@ lig@@ ations to@@ ward ro@@ cks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel comp@@ as@@ sion for ro@@ cks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ cks can su@@ ff@@ er . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our fel@@ low pri@@ mat@@ es than we are about in@@ sec@@ ts , as inde@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ posed to a gre@@ ater ran@@ ge of pot@@ ential happ@@ in@@ ess and su@@ ff@@ ering ."
"Now , the c@@ ru@@ cial thing to not@@ ice here is that this is a fac@@ tual c@@ la@@ im : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ stru@@ ed the relation@@ ship between biolog@@ ical compl@@ ex@@ ity and the pos@@ sibil@@ ities of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ sec@@ ts ."
"And there &apos;s no not@@ ion , no ver@@ sion of human mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about consci@@ ous experience and its possible changes ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ ues from religi@@ on , even if you think that good and e@@ vil ul@@ tim@@ ately rel@@ ate to cond@@ itions after de@@ ath — ei@@ ther to an et@@ ern@@ ity of happ@@ in@@ ess with G@@ od or an et@@ ern@@ ity of su@@ ff@@ ering in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can per@@ si@@ st after de@@ ath is itself a fac@@ tual c@@ la@@ im , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to speak about the cond@@ itions of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a contin@@ u@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fa@@ il@@ ed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mo@@ thers can@@ not fe@@ ed their children , where stran@@ g@@ ers can@@ not find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ace@@ ful col@@ labor@@ ation , where people are m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in@@ dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this contin@@ u@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more id@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a con@@ fer@@ ence like this is even conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ wers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ era to the water be a good idea ?
P@@ rob@@ ably not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the e@@ vil e@@ ye , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ ately bl@@ ame their ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s ? P@@ rob@@ ably not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human comm@@ unities fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And mor@@ ality rel@@ ates to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ ues we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our situ@@ ation in the world can be under@@ sto@@ od at many le@@ vel@@ s — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic systems and polit@@ ical ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being we are , of ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — what@@ ever happens after de@@ ath .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ ici@@ de b@@ om@@ ber does get 7@@ 2 vir@@ g@@ ins in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his person@@ ality — his rather un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate person@@ ality — is the produc@@ t of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as inde@@ ed it does , it changes us by chang@@ ing our bra@@ ins ."
"And so th@@ ere@@ fore what@@ ever cul@@ tu@@ ral vari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh can , at least in prin@@ ci@@ ple , be under@@ sto@@ od in the con@@ text of a mat@@ uring science of the mind — ne@@ uro@@ science , p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ y , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m argu@@ ing is that val@@ ue &apos;s re@@ duc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the consci@@ ous experience of consci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can th@@ ere@@ fore vis@@ u@@ aliz@@ e a space of possible changes in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a mor@@ al lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape , with pe@@ ak@@ s and val@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ res@@ po@@ nd to differ@@ ences in the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of consci@@ ous cre@@ at@@ ures , both pers@@ onal and colle@@ ctive ."
"And one thing to not@@ ice is that perhaps there are stat@@ es of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being that we ra@@ rely acc@@ ess , that few people acc@@ ess ."
And these a@@ wa@@ it our discover@@ y .
Per@@ haps some of these stat@@ es can be appro@@ pri@@ ately called my@@ st@@ ical or sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual .
Per@@ haps there are other stat@@ es that we can &apos;t acc@@ ess because of how our min@@ ds are struc@@ tu@@ red but other min@@ ds pos@@ si@@ bly could acc@@ ess them .
"Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to ma@@ p this space , or that we will have scienti@@ fic ans@@ wers to every conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able mor@@ al question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for in@@ stance , that you will one day con@@ sul@@ t a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should b@@ om@@ b I@@ ran &apos;s nu@@ clear fac@@ il@@ ities , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the full cost of TED as a business ex@@ pen@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions aff@@ ect human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being then they do have ans@@ wers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting this — just ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting that there are right and wrong ans@@ wers to the question of how humans fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh — will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our expe@@ c@@ t@@ ations of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For in@@ stance , there are 2@@ 1 stat@@ es in our country where cor@@ po@@ ral pu@@ ni@@ sh@@ ment in the clas@@ s@@ room is leg@@ al , where it is leg@@ al for a teach@@ er to be@@ at a child with a wo@@ od@@ en bo@@ ard , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing large b@@ ru@@ is@@ es and bli@@ st@@ ers and even bre@@ a@@ king the sk@@ in ."
"And hun@@ dre@@ ds of thousands of children , in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , are sub@@ jec@@ ted to this every year ."
"The lo@@ c@@ ations of these en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed di@@ stri@@ c@@ ts , I think , will fa@@ il to surpri@@ se you ."
We &apos;re not talking about Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ c@@ ut .
And the r@@ ation@@ ale for this behavi@@ or is ex@@ p@@ lic@@ it@@ ly religi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ ator of the universe him@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , l@@ est we spo@@ il the child — this is in Pro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the obvi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally spe@@ a@@ king , to sub@@ ject children to pa@@ in and viol@@ ence and public hum@@ ili@@ ation as a way of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging heal@@ thy emot@@ i@@ onal develop@@ ment and good behavi@@ or ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the not@@ ion of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being is tru@@ ly un@@ de@@ fin@@ ed , and se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ally open to be re@@ -@@ con@@ stru@@ ed ."
"And so , how th@@ ere@@ fore can there be an ob@@ jec@@ tive not@@ ion of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ?"
"Well , consi@@ der by anal@@ og@@ y , the conc@@ ept of physi@@ cal health ."
The conc@@ ept of physi@@ cal health is un@@ de@@ fin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from M@@ i@@ cha@@ el S@@ pe@@ c@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
Wh@@ en this stat@@ ue was car@@ ved the aver@@ age life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the develop@@ ed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ d@@ dle with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to run a ma@@ ra@@ th@@ on at age 2@@ 00 will be consi@@ der@@ ed a pro@@ found dis@@ ability .
P@@ eople will sen@@ d you don@@ ations when you &apos;re in that cond@@ ition .
"( Laughter ) N@@ ot@@ ice that the fact that the conc@@ ept of health is open , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely open for re@@ vision , does not make it v@@ ac@@ u@@ ous ."
The dist@@ in@@ ction between a heal@@ thy person and a de@@ ad one is about as clear and con@@ sequ@@ ential as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to not@@ ice is there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the mor@@ al lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape : There may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to organiz@@ e a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ m@@ ine an ob@@ jec@@ tive mor@@ ality ?"
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tem@@ p@@ ted to argu@@ e to you that there must be one right food to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a ran@@ ge of materi@@ als that con@@ st@@ it@@ ute heal@@ thy food .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess a clear dist@@ in@@ ction between food and pois@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ wers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tem@@ pt us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human nu@@ tr@@ ition ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a univers@@ al mor@@ ality would re@@ qui@@ re mor@@ al pre@@ c@@ ep@@ ts that ad@@ m@@ it of no exc@@ ep@@ tions .
"So , for in@@ stance , if it &apos;s really wrong to li@@ e , it must always be wrong to li@@ e , and if you can find an exc@@ ep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as mor@@ al tru@@ th ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , by anal@@ og@@ y , the game of ches@@ s ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to play good ches@@ s , a prin@@ ci@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t lo@@ se your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its some exc@@ ep@@ tions .
There are mo@@ ments when lo@@ sing your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en is a br@@ illi@@ ant thing to do .
There are mo@@ ments when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ches@@ s is a dom@@ a@@ in of perf@@ ect ob@@ jec@@ tiv@@ ity ."
The fact that there are exc@@ ep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this br@@ ings us to the sor@@ ts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the mor@@ al sp@@ here ."
Con@@ si@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bod@@ ies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can c@@ over them up .
"Now , it is the pos@@ ition , gener@@ ally spe@@ a@@ king , of our intel@@ le@@ c@@ tual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ ost@@ on or P@@ alo Al@@ to , who are we to say that the pro@@ u@@ d d@@ eni@@ z@@ ens of an an@@ ci@@ ent culture are wrong to for@@ ce their wi@@ ves and d@@ augh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with len@@ g@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or th@@ row bat@@ ter@@ y ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they de@@ cl@@ ine the priv@@ il@@ e@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pret@@ end that we know so little about human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being that we have to be no@@ n-@@ ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental about a pra@@ cti@@ ce like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary w@@ ear@@ ing of a ve@@ il — women should be able to we@@ ar what@@ ever they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary mean in a community where , when a girl gets ra@@ ped , her father &apos;s first im@@ pul@@ se , rather often , is to m@@ ur@@ der her out of sh@@ ame ?"
"@@ Ju@@ st let that fact det@@ on@@ ate in your brain for a minut@@ e : Y@@ our d@@ aughter gets ra@@ ped , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ pres@@ ents a pe@@ ak of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perf@@ ect solution in our own society ."
"For in@@ stance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ stand almost any@@ where in the ci@@ viliz@@ ed world ."
"Now , gran@@ ted , for many men it may re@@ qui@@ re a de@@ gre@@ e in ph@@ il@@ oso@@ ph@@ y to see something wrong with these images ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ fle@@ ctive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the perf@@ ect ex@@ pres@@ sion of p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical bal@@ ance with re@@ spe@@ ct to vari@@ ab@@ les like y@@ outh and beau@@ ty and women &apos;s bod@@ ies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ tim@@ al environment in which to ra@@ ise our children ?"
"P@@ rob@@ ably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m between these two ex@@ t@@ rem@@ es that re@@ pres@@ ents a place of better bal@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) Per@@ haps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the mor@@ al lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape ."
But the thing to not@@ ice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ ak .
"Now the i@@ ro@@ ny , from my perspe@@ ctive , is that the only people who se@@ em to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ wers to mor@@ al questions are religi@@ ous de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ wers to mor@@ al questions because they got these ans@@ wers from a vo@@ ice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ w@@ ind , not because they made an intellig@@ ent anal@@ ys@@ is of the cau@@ ses and cond@@ ition of human and anim@@ al w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ."
"In fact , the en@@ d@@ ur@@ ance of religi@@ on as a len@@ s through which most people view mor@@ al questions has se@@ par@@ ated most mor@@ al talk from real questions of human and anim@@ al su@@ ff@@ ering ."
This is why we spend our time talking about things like g@@ ay mar@@ ri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or nu@@ clear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or pover@@ ty or any other hu@@ g@@ ely con@@ sequ@@ ential issue .
But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : We need a univers@@ al conc@@ ep@@ tion of human val@@ ues .
"Now , what stan@@ ds in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to not@@ ice is that we do something different when talking about mor@@ ality — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally se@@ cul@@ ar , ac@@ a@@ de@@ mic , sci@@ ent@@ ist ty@@ p@@ es ."
Wh@@ en talking about mor@@ ality we val@@ ue differ@@ ences of op@@ in@@ ion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
"So , for in@@ stance the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ am@@ a gets up every mor@@ ning medit@@ ating on comp@@ as@@ sion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ ping other human be@@ ings is an in@@ te@@ gra@@ l com@@ pon@@ ent of human happ@@ in@@ ess ."
"On the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy ; T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy was very f@@ ond of ab@@ duc@@ ting and ra@@ ping and tor@@ tur@@ ing and kill@@ ing young women ."
"So , we appe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ in@@ ion about how to prof@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) Mo@@ st W@@ ester@@ n intel@@ le@@ c@@ tu@@ als look at this situ@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ am@@ a to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real argu@@ ment that pot@@ enti@@ ally f@@ all@@ s within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He lik@@ es cho@@ col@@ ate , he lik@@ es v@@ an@@ ill@@ a ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ a@@ de the other . &quot; &quot; N@@ ot@@ ice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
On the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a str@@ ing the@@ or@@ ist .
"If you ask the sm@@ ar@@ test physi@@ ci@@ sts around who is the sm@@ ar@@ test physi@@ c@@ ist around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I sho@@ wed up at a physi@@ cs con@@ fer@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing the@@ ory is bog@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t res@@ on@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small scale .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physi@@ c@@ ist ; I don &apos;t understand str@@ ing the@@ ory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy of str@@ ing the@@ ory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to bel@@ ong to any str@@ ing the@@ ory clu@@ b that would have me as a mem@@ ber .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ in@@ i@@ ons must be exc@@ lu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a dom@@ a@@ in of ex@@ per@@ ti@@ se .
That is what it is for knowled@@ ge to coun@@ t .
"H@@ ow have we con@@ vin@@ ced ourselves that in the mor@@ al sp@@ here there is no such thing as mor@@ al ex@@ per@@ ti@@ se , or mor@@ al tal@@ ent , or mor@@ al g@@ eni@@ us even ? How have we con@@ vin@@ ced our@@ sel@@ ves@@ "
that every op@@ in@@ ion has to coun@@ t ? How have we con@@ vin@@ ced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ jects wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ?
D@@ o@@ es the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an have a point of view on physi@@ cs that is wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ig@@ no@@ ran@@ ce any less obvi@@ ous on the sub@@ ject of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now ."
"It needs people like ourselves to ad@@ m@@ it that there are right and wrong ans@@ wers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing , and mor@@ ality rel@@ ates to that dom@@ a@@ in of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for individu@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beli@@ ef@@ s and des@@ i@@ res that reli@@ ably le@@ ad to need@@ less human su@@ ff@@ ering ."
Ju@@ st ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting this will trans@@ form our dis@@ course about mor@@ ality .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es between n@@ ations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world f@@ ill@@ ed with dest@@ ru@@ ctive technology , and this technology can@@ not be un@@ inv@@ ented ; it will always be e@@ a@@ si@@ er to bre@@ ak things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It se@@ ems to me , th@@ ere@@ fore , pat@@ ently obvi@@ ous that we can no more re@@ spe@@ ct and tol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in not@@ i@@ ons of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being than we can re@@ spe@@ ct or tol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in the not@@ i@@ ons about how disease s@@ pre@@ ads , or in the sa@@ f@@ ety stan@@ dar@@ ds of buil@@ din@@ gs and air@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must con@@ ver@@ ge on the ans@@ wers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ m@@ it that these questions have ans@@ wers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble material there ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther in this audi@@ ence or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , hear@@ ing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ ra@@ ge thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age se@@ ems to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women d@@ res@@ sed in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , spo@@ k@@ en with a lot of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a c@@ ele@@ br@@ ation of f@@ em@@ ale speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a resul@@ t of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is argu@@ ably a so@@ ph@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical view — &quot; that mal@@ e lu@@ st is not to be tru@@ st@@ ed . &quot;"
"I mean , can you eng@@ age in a con@@ vers@@ ation with that kind of woman without se@@ em@@ ing kind of cul@@ tu@@ ral im@@ peri@@ al@@ ist ?"
"S@@ am H@@ ar@@ ris : Yeah , well I think I tri@@ ed to bro@@ ach this in a sent@@ ence , wat@@ ching the clo@@ ck ti@@ c@@ king , but the question is : What is vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary in a con@@ text where men have certain expe@@ c@@ t@@ ations , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il y@@ ourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to we@@ ar a ve@@ il , or a very fun@@ ny h@@ at , or tat@@ too their face — I think we should be free to vol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily do what@@ ever we want , but we have to be h@@ on@@ est about the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that these women are plac@@ ed under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ag@@ er to always take their word for it , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re w@@ ear@@ ing a full bur@@ q@@ a ."
C@@ A : A lot of people want to believe in this conc@@ ept of mor@@ al progres@@ s .
But can you re@@ conc@@ ile that ?
"I think I under@@ sto@@ od you to say that you could re@@ conc@@ ile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one d@@ imen@@ si@@ onal , where we all have to think the same ."
"P@@ a@@ in@@ t your picture of what ro@@ l@@ ling the clo@@ ck 50 years for@@ ward , 100 years for@@ ward , how you would like to think of the world , bal@@ an@@ cing mor@@ al progres@@ s with ri@@ ch@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ m@@ it that we are on the pat@@ h to@@ ward under@@ standing our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important det@@ a@@ il , then you have to ad@@ m@@ it that we are going to understand all of the pos@@ itive and ne@@ g@@ ative qu@@ al@@ ities of ourselves in much gre@@ ater det@@ a@@ il ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand pos@@ itive social emot@@ ion like em@@ pa@@ thy and comp@@ as@@ sion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge it — whether they &apos;re genet@@ ic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and in@@ so@@ far as we beg@@ in to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably going to con@@ ver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gra@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my d@@ aughter from bir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ fi@@ dent and w@@ ell@@ -@@ educ@@ ated in the con@@ text of men who do des@@ i@@ re women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gran@@ t to know that comp@@ ul@@ s@@ ory ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone invol@@ ved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
Do people love their d@@ augh@@ ters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ wers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the resul@@ ts come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ pa@@ red to shi@@ ft your inst@@ in@@ ctive cur@@ r@@ ent ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these issu@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well ye@@ ah , mo@@ du@@ lo one obvi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the con@@ text of a tru@@ ly del@@ u@@ si@@ onal beli@@ e@@ f system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my g@@ ay son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a bo@@ y@@ friend , I ch@@ op@@ ped his head off . And that was the most comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts al@@ ig@@ ned , yes I think you could probably be feel@@ ing the emot@@ ion of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about w@@ ell@@ -@@ being in a lar@@ ger con@@ text ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feel@@ ing ec@@ st@@ as@@ y and then blo@@ wing him@@ self up on a bu@@ s ."
"C@@ A : S@@ am , this is a con@@ vers@@ ation I would actually love to contin@@ ue for hours ."
"We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED ."

"S@@ ch@@ lau@@ g found that his stro@@ ke vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s who were ap@@ ha@@ sic , could not form sent@@ ences of thre@@ e@@ - or f@@ our@@ -@@ word sent@@ ences , but they could still sing the ly@@ ri@@ cs to a s@@ ong , whether it was &quot; &quot; H@@ app@@ y B@@ ir@@ th@@ day T@@ o You &quot; &quot; or their fav@@ or@@ ite s@@ ong by the E@@ ag@@ les or the R@@ ol@@ ling S@@ t@@ ones ."
"And after 70 hours of in@@ ten@@ sive sing@@ ing l@@ ess@@ ons , he found that the music was able to liter@@ ally re@@ wi@@ re the bra@@ ins of his patients and create a hom@@ olog@@ ous spe@@ ec@@ h cent@@ er in their right h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere to comp@@ en@@ s@@ ate for the left h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere &apos;s dam@@ age ."
"When I was 1@@ 7 , I vis@@ ited D@@ r@@ . S@@ ch@@ lau@@ g &apos;s la@@ b , and in one af@@ ter@@ no@@ on he wal@@ ked me through some of the le@@ ad@@ ing research on music and the brain — how mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans had fundam@@ ent@@ ally different brain structure than no@@ n-@@ mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans , how music , and list@@ ening to music , could just light up the entire brain , from our pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x all the way back to our c@@ ere@@ bel@@ lu@@ m , how music was be@@ coming a ne@@ uro@@ p@@ sy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c mo@@ d@@ ality to help children with au@@ t@@ ism , to help people stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with st@@ ress and an@@ x@@ i@@ ety and depres@@ sion , how de@@ e@@ ply Par@@ kin@@ s@@ on@@ i@@ an patients would find that their tre@@ mo@@ r and their ga@@ it would ste@@ ad@@ y when they list@@ en@@ ed to music ,"
"@@ and how l@@ at@@ e-@@ stage Al@@ zh@@ e@@ im@@ er &apos;s patients , wh@@ ose de@@ men@@ ti@@ a was so far progres@@ sed that they could no longer recogniz@@ e their family , could still pic@@ k out a tu@@ ne by C@@ ho@@ p@@ in at the pi@@ ano that they had learned when they were children ."
"But I had an ul@@ ter@@ i@@ or mot@@ i@@ ve of vis@@ iting G@@ ot@@ t@@ fri@@ ed S@@ ch@@ lau@@ g , and it was this : that I was at a c@@ ros@@ s@@ ro@@ ads in my life , trying to cho@@ ose between music and medi@@ c@@ ine ."
"I had just complet@@ ed my under@@ gradu@@ ate , and I was working as a research as@@ sist@@ ant at the la@@ b of D@@ en@@ n@@ is S@@ el@@ ko@@ e , stud@@ ying Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , and I had f@@ all@@ en in love with ne@@ uro@@ science . I wanted to become a sur@@ ge@@ on ."
"I wanted to become a doc@@ tor like P@@ au@@ l F@@ ar@@ mer or R@@ ick H@@ od@@ es , these kind of f@@ ear@@ less men who go into places like H@@ a@@ it@@ i or E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia and work with A@@ I@@ D@@ S patients with mul@@ ti@@ drug@@ -@@ re@@ sist@@ ant tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ s@@ is , or with children with dis@@ fig@@ uring can@@ c@@ ers ."
"I wanted to become that kind of R@@ ed C@@ ross doc@@ tor , that doc@@ tor without bor@@ ders ."
"On the other hand , I had pla@@ yed the viol@@ in my entire life ."
Mu@@ sic for me was more than a pas@@ sion . It was ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion .
"It was o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en . I was lu@@ ck@@ y enough to have studi@@ ed at the Ju@@ illi@@ ard S@@ cho@@ ol in M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ t@@ an , and to have pla@@ yed my de@@ but with Z@@ ub@@ in M@@ eh@@ ta and the I@@ s@@ ra@@ eli ph@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra in T@@ el A@@ vi@@ v , and it turned out that G@@ ot@@ t@@ fri@@ ed S@@ ch@@ lau@@ g had studi@@ ed as an organ@@ ist at the V@@ i@@ en@@ na Con@@ ser@@ vat@@ ory , but had given up his love for music to pur@@ su@@ e a care@@ er in medi@@ c@@ ine . And that af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , I had to ask him , &quot; How was it for you making that deci@@ sion ? &quot;"
"And he said that there were still times when he wi@@ shed he could go back and play the org@@ an the way he used to , and that for me , medi@@ cal school could wa@@ it , but that the viol@@ in simply would not ."
"And after two more years of stud@@ ying music , I decided to sho@@ ot for the im@@ possible before taking the M@@ C@@ A@@ T and ap@@ pl@@ ying to medi@@ cal school like a good Indi@@ an son to become the next D@@ r@@ . G@@ up@@ ta . ( Laughter ) And I decided to sho@@ ot for the im@@ possible and I took an au@@ d@@ ition for the est@@ e@@ em@@ ed L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es P@@ h@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic ."
"It was my first au@@ d@@ ition , and after three days of pla@@ ying behind a scre@@ en in a tri@@ al week , I was off@@ er@@ ed the pos@@ ition ."
"And it was a dre@@ am . It was a w@@ il@@ d dre@@ am to per@@ form in an or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra , to per@@ form in the ic@@ on@@ ic W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ney Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all in an or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra con@@ duc@@ ted now by the fam@@ ous G@@ u@@ stav@@ o D@@ ud@@ am@@ el , but much more import@@ an@@ tly to me to be sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans and men@@ tors that became my new family , my new mu@@ si@@ cal home ."
"But a year later , I met another mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an who had also studi@@ ed at Ju@@ illi@@ ard , one who prof@@ oun@@ dly hel@@ ped me find my vo@@ ice and sh@@ ap@@ ed my id@@ ent@@ ity as a mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an ."
"Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el A@@ y@@ ers was a d@@ ou@@ ble bas@@ si@@ st at Ju@@ illi@@ ard , but he su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed a seri@@ es of p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ic ep@@ is@@ od@@ es in his early 20@@ s , was tre@@ ated with th@@ or@@ az@@ ine at B@@ el@@ lev@@ ue , and en@@ ded up living hom@@ el@@ ess on the stre@@ ets of S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es 30 years later ."
"Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el &apos;s story has become a be@@ ac@@ on for hom@@ el@@ es@@ sn@@ ess and mental health ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ac@@ y throu@@ gh@@ out the United States , as told through the book and the mo@@ vie &quot; &quot; The S@@ olo@@ ist , &quot; &quot; but I became his friend , and I became his viol@@ in teach@@ er , and I told him that wh@@ er@@ ever he had his viol@@ in , and wh@@ er@@ ever I had m@@ ine , I would play a les@@ son with him ."
"And on the many times I saw Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el on S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow , I w@@ it@@ nes@@ sed how music was able to bring him back from his very dar@@ k@@ est mo@@ ments , from what se@@ em@@ ed to me in my un@@ tra@@ ined e@@ ye to be the beg@@ in@@ n@@ ings of a sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ eni@@ c ep@@ is@@ ode ."
"P@@ la@@ ying for Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el , the music took on a de@@ ep@@ er me@@ an@@ ing , because now it was about communic@@ ation , a communic@@ ation where words fa@@ il@@ ed , a communic@@ ation of a mes@@ sage that went de@@ ep@@ er than words , that regi@@ ster@@ ed at a fundam@@ ent@@ ally pri@@ m@@ al level in Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el &apos;s p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e , yet came as a true mu@@ si@@ cal off@@ ering from me ."
"I found myself gro@@ wing ou@@ tra@@ g@@ ed that someone like Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el could have ever been hom@@ el@@ ess on S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow because of his mental ill@@ ness , yet how many ten@@ s of thousands of others there were out there on S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow alone who had stories as tra@@ gic as his , but were never going to have a book or a mo@@ vie made about them that got them off the stre@@ ets ?"
"And at the very cor@@ e of this cri@@ s@@ is of m@@ ine , I felt some@@ how the life of music had cho@@ se@@ n me , where some@@ how , perhaps pos@@ si@@ bly in a very nai@@ ve sense , I felt what S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow really needed was somebody like P@@ au@@ l F@@ ar@@ mer and not another clas@@ si@@ cal mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an pla@@ ying on B@@ un@@ k@@ er H@@ ill ."
"But in the end , it was Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el who sho@@ wed me that if I was tru@@ ly pas@@ sion@@ ate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the perf@@ ect instru@@ ment to do it , that music was the bri@@ d@@ ge that conne@@ cted my world and his ."
"There &apos;s a beautiful quot@@ e by the R@@ om@@ anti@@ c Ger@@ man com@@ pos@@ er R@@ ob@@ er@@ t S@@ ch@@ um@@ an@@ n , who said , &quot; &quot; T@@ o sen@@ d light into the dar@@ k@@ ness of men &apos;s hear@@ ts , such is the du@@ ty of the art@@ ist . &quot; &quot; And this is a particul@@ arly po@@ ig@@ n@@ ant quot@@ e because S@@ ch@@ um@@ an@@ n him@@ self su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed from sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ eni@@ a and di@@ ed in as@@ y@@ lu@@ m ."
"And in@@ spi@@ red by what I learned from Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el , I started an organiz@@ ation on S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow of mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans called S@@ tre@@ et S@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ ony , br@@ ing@@ ing the light of music into the very dar@@ k@@ est places , per@@ form@@ ing for the hom@@ el@@ ess and men@@ t@@ ally ill at sh@@ el@@ ters and cl@@ in@@ ics on S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow , per@@ form@@ ing for com@@ b@@ at vet@@ er@@ ans with post@@ -@@ tra@@ um@@ atic st@@ ress dis@@ order , and for the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated and those lab@@ el@@ ed as cri@@ min@@ ally in@@ san@@ e ."
"A@@ f@@ ter one of our ev@@ ents at the P@@ at@@ ton S@@ t@@ ate H@@ os@@ pit@@ al in S@@ an B@@ er@@ nar@@ din@@ o , a woman wal@@ ked up to us and she had te@@ ar@@ s stre@@ am@@ ing down her face , and she had a pal@@ sy , she was sha@@ king , and she had this gor@@ ge@@ ous sm@@ ile , and she said that she had never heard clas@@ si@@ cal music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a viol@@ in before , but that hear@@ ing this music was like hear@@ ing the su@@ n@@ sh@@ ine , and that no@@ body ever came to vi@@ sit them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she sto@@ pped sha@@ king without medi@@ c@@ ation ."
"S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly , what we &apos;re fin@@ ding with these con@@ cer@@ ts , away from the stage , away from the fo@@ ot@@ li@@ ghts , out of the tu@@ x@@ e@@ do ta@@ il@@ s , the mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans become the con@@ du@@ it for deli@@ ver@@ ing the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ ti@@ c ben@@ ef@@ its of music on the brain to an audi@@ ence that would never have acc@@ ess to this room , would never have acc@@ ess to the kind of music that we make ."
"@@ Ju@@ st as medi@@ c@@ ine ser@@ ves to he@@ al more than the building blo@@ cks of the body alone , the power and beau@@ ty of music tran@@ sc@@ ends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our bel@@ ov@@ ed ac@@ ro@@ nym ."
Mu@@ sic tran@@ sc@@ ends the a@@ es@@ th@@ et@@ ic beau@@ ty alone .
"The sy@@ n@@ ch@@ ro@@ ny of emot@@ i@@ ons that we experience when we hear an oper@@ a by W@@ ag@@ ner , or a sym@@ ph@@ ony by B@@ ra@@ h@@ ms , or ch@@ am@@ ber music by B@@ e@@ e@@ th@@ ov@@ en , comp@@ els us to remember our sha@@ red , common hum@@ an@@ ity , the de@@ e@@ ply com@@ mu@@ nal conne@@ cted consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess , the em@@ pa@@ th@@ ic consci@@ ou@@ sn@@ ess that ne@@ uro@@ p@@ sy@@ chi@@ atri@@ st I@@ a@@ in M@@ c@@ G@@ il@@ ch@@ ri@@ st says is har@@ d-@@ wi@@ red into our brain &apos;s right h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere ."
"And for those living in the most de@@ hum@@ an@@ iz@@ ing cond@@ itions of mental ill@@ ness within hom@@ el@@ es@@ sn@@ ess and in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , the music and the beau@@ ty of music off@@ ers a chan@@ ce for them to tran@@ sc@@ end the world around them , to remember that they still have the cap@@ ac@@ ity to experience something beautiful and that hum@@ an@@ ity has not for@@ got@@ ten them ."
"And the sp@@ ar@@ k of that beau@@ ty , the sp@@ ar@@ k of that hum@@ an@@ ity trans@@ form@@ s into hope , and we know , whether we cho@@ ose the pat@@ h of music or of medi@@ c@@ ine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must inst@@ ill within our comm@@ unities , within our audi@@ ences , if we want to in@@ spi@@ re heal@@ ing from within ."
"I &apos;d like to end with a quot@@ e by J@@ oh@@ n K@@ e@@ ats , the R@@ om@@ anti@@ c En@@ gli@@ sh po@@ et , a very fam@@ ous quot@@ e that I &apos;m sure all of you know ."
"K@@ e@@ ats him@@ self had also given up a care@@ er in medi@@ c@@ ine to pur@@ su@@ e po@@ et@@ ry , but he di@@ ed when he was a year ol@@ der than me ."
"And K@@ e@@ ats said , &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ au@@ ty is tru@@ th , and tru@@ th beau@@ ty ."
"That is all ye know on Earth , and all ye need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause )"
"Th@@ ank you so much everyone from TED , and Ch@@ ris and A@@ my in particular ."
I can@@ not believe I &apos;m here .
I have not sle@@ pt in we@@ eks .
"Ne@@ il and I were sit@@ ting there com@@ par@@ ing how little we &apos;ve sle@@ pt in anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation for this . I &apos;ve never been so ner@@ v@@ ous — and I do this when I &apos;m ner@@ v@@ ous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organiz@@ ation called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might jo@@ in in and do si@@ mil@@ ar things ."
"B@@ ack in about 20@@ 00 , I was living in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , I was trying to fin@@ ish my first book , I was wan@@ der@@ ing around da@@ z@@ ed every day because I w@@ ro@@ te from 12 a@@ .@@ m@@ . to 5 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
So I would walk around in a da@@ ze during the day .
"I had no mental ac@@ u@@ ity to speak of during the day , but I had fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble hours ."
"In the B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od that I li@@ ved in , Par@@ k S@@ lo@@ pe , there are a lot of writ@@ ers — it &apos;s like a very high per cap@@ it@@ a r@@ ati@@ o of writ@@ ers to norm@@ al people ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , I had gro@@ wn up around a lot of teach@@ ers ."
"My mom was a teach@@ er , my sist@@ er became a teach@@ er and after colle@@ ge so many of my friends went into teach@@ ing ."
"And so I was always hear@@ ing them talk about their lives and how in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing they were , and they were really sort of the most har@@ d-@@ working and con@@ stan@@ tly in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing people I knew ."
"But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the stru@@ g@@ gl@@ es they were de@@ al@@ ing with ."
"And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teach@@ ing in city scho@@ ols were having t@@ rou@@ ble with their students ke@@ ep@@ ing up at gra@@ de level , in their read@@ ing and writ@@ ing in particular ."
"Now , so many of these students had come from hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds where En@@ gli@@ sh isn &apos;t spo@@ k@@ en in the home , where a lot of them have different speci@@ al needs , learning dis@@ abil@@ ities . And of course they &apos;re working in scho@@ ols which sometimes and very often are under@@ -@@ fun@@ ded ."
"And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bod@@ ies , more on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion , more hours , more ex@@ per@@ ti@@ se from people that have sk@@ ill@@ s in En@@ gli@@ sh and can work with these students on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five clas@@ ses of 30 to 40 students each ."
"This can le@@ ad up to 1@@ 50 , 1@@ 80 , 2@@ 00 students a day ."
How can we pos@@ si@@ bly give each stud@@ ent even one h@@ our a week of on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to gre@@ at@@ ly mul@@ ti@@ ply the work@@ week and cl@@ one the teach@@ ers .
And so we started talking about this .
"And at the same time , I thought about this mas@@ sive group of people I knew : writ@@ ers , ed@@ it@@ ors , jour@@ nal@@ ist@@ s , gradu@@ ate students , as@@ sist@@ ant profes@@ sor@@ s , you name it ."
"A@@ ll these people that had sort of fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble da@@ ily hours and an inter@@ est in the En@@ gli@@ sh word — I hope to have an inter@@ est in the En@@ gli@@ sh language , but I &apos;m not spe@@ a@@ king it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clo@@ ck has got me ."
"But everyone that I knew had an inter@@ est in the pri@@ m@@ ac@@ y of the writ@@ ten word in terms of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing a demo@@ cra@@ cy , n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing an en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed life ."
"And so they had , you know , their time and their inter@@ est , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a con@@ du@@ it that I knew of in my community to bring these two comm@@ unities together ."
"So when I mo@@ ved back to S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , we r@@ ented this building ."
"And the idea was to put M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s — M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s Q@@ u@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly , that we publi@@ shed tw@@ ice or three times a year , and a few other magaz@@ ines — we were going to move it into an off@@ ice for the first time ."
It used to be in my kit@@ ch@@ en in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n .
"We were going to move it into an off@@ ice , and we were going to actually share space with a tu@@ tor@@ ing cent@@ er ."
"So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writ@@ ers and ed@@ it@@ ors and everybody — sort of a writ@@ ing community — coming into the off@@ ice every day any@@ way , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get ex@@ tr@@ a help on their writ@@ ten hom@@ e@@ work , so you have basically no bor@@ der between these two comm@@ unities ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on what@@ ever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . the students f@@ low in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you tra@@ de , or you work a little bit later or what@@ ever it is ."
You give those hours in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on to the students in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od .
"So , we had this place , we r@@ ented it , the lan@@ dl@@ or@@ d was all for it . We did this mu@@ ral , that &apos;s a Ch@@ ris W@@ are mu@@ ral , that basically expla@@ ins the entire history of the prin@@ ted word , in mu@@ ral form — it takes a long time to dig@@ est and you have to stand in the middle of the ro@@ ad ."
So we r@@ ented this space .
"And everything was great exc@@ ept the lan@@ dl@@ or@@ d said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is z@@ on@@ ed for re@@ ta@@ il ; you have to come up with something ."
You &apos;ve got@@ ta s@@ ell something .
"You can &apos;t just have a tu@@ tor@@ ing cent@@ er . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ha ! Re@@ ally ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily to s@@ ell , but we did all the ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ary research ."
"It used to be a we@@ ight room , so there were ru@@ b@@ ber flo@@ ors bel@@ ow , ac@@ ou@@ st@@ ic t@@ ile c@@ e@@ il@@ ings and f@@ lu@@ o@@ res@@ c@@ ent li@@ ghts ."
"We took all that down , and we found beautiful wo@@ od@@ en flo@@ ors , wh@@ it@@ e@@ wa@@ shed be@@ am@@ s and it had the look — while we were ren@@ ov@@ ating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the h@@ ul@@ l of a ship . &quot;"
"And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should s@@ ell su@@ pp@@ li@@ es to the working bu@@ c@@ can@@ e@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody lau@@ gh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that ."
Let &apos;s s@@ ell pi@@ rate su@@ pp@@ li@@ es . &quot; &quot; This is the pi@@ rate sup@@ ply st@@ ore .
"You see , this is sort of a sk@@ et@@ ch I did on a na@@ p@@ k@@ in ."
"A great car@@ p@@ ent@@ er built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pi@@ rate sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ like ."
Here you see plan@@ ks sol@@ d by the fo@@ ot and we have su@@ pp@@ li@@ es to com@@ b@@ at sc@@ ur@@ vy .
"We have the pe@@ g le@@ gs there , that are all han@@ d@@ made and f@@ it@@ ted to you ."
"U@@ p at the top , you see the e@@ y@@ ep@@ at@@ ch dis@@ play , which is the black col@@ um@@ n there for every@@ day use for your e@@ y@@ ep@@ at@@ ch , and then you have the pa@@ st@@ el and other col@@ ors for ste@@ pp@@ ing out at night — speci@@ al oc@@ ca@@ sions , b@@ ar m@@ it@@ z@@ va@@ h@@ s and what@@ ever ."
So we op@@ en@@ ed this place . And this is a v@@ at that we f@@ ill with tre@@ as@@ ures that students di@@ g in .
This is re@@ plac@@ ement eyes in case you lo@@ se one .
These are some sig@@ ns that we have all over the place : &quot; P@@ ra@@ cti@@ cal J@@ oking with P@@ i@@ rat@@ es . &quot;
"Wh@@ ile you &apos;re read@@ ing the sig@@ n , we pul@@ l a ro@@ pe behind the coun@@ ter and e@@ ight mo@@ p he@@ ads dro@@ p on your head ."
That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that dro@@ ps on people &apos;s he@@ ads .
"It became mo@@ p he@@ ads . And this is the fish the@@ ater , which is just a s@@ al@@ tw@@ ater t@@ ank with three se@@ ats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tu@@ tor@@ ing cent@@ er ."
"So right there is the tu@@ tor@@ ing cent@@ er , and then behind the cur@@ tain were the M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s off@@ ices , where all of us would be working on the magaz@@ ine and book ed@@ iting and things like that ."
The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
"We set the place up , we op@@ en@@ ed up , we sp@@ ent months and months ren@@ ov@@ ating this place ."
"We had ta@@ bl@@ es , cha@@ ir@@ s , compu@@ ters , everything ."
I went to a d@@ ot@@ -@@ c@@ om au@@ ction at a H@@ ol@@ i@@ day In@@ n in P@@ alo Al@@ to and I b@@ ou@@ ght 11 G@@ 4@@ s with a stro@@ ke of a pad@@ dle .
"A@@ ny@@ way , we b@@ ou@@ ght &apos; em , we set everything up and then we wa@@ ited ."
"It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writ@@ ers in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
"And we s@@ at . And at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . we put a san@@ d@@ w@@ ich bo@@ ard out on the front si@@ de@@ walk and it just said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree T@@ ut@@ or@@ ing for Y@@ our En@@ gli@@ sh@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated and W@@ rit@@ ing@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated Ne@@ ed@@ s — Ju@@ st C@@ ome In , It &apos;s All F@@ ree . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to stor@@ m the g@@ ates , they &apos;re g@@ on@@ na love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t ."
"And so we wa@@ ited , we s@@ at at the ta@@ bl@@ es , we wa@@ ited and wa@@ ited ."
"And everybody was be@@ coming very dis@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed because it was we@@ eks and we@@ eks that we wa@@ ited , really , where no@@ body came in ."
"And then somebody al@@ er@@ ted us to the fact that maybe there was a tru@@ st ga@@ p , because we were oper@@ ating behind a pi@@ rate sup@@ ply st@@ ore . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?"
"And so then , around that time , I per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed a woman na@@ med N@@ in@@ ev@@ e@@ h C@@ al@@ ig@@ ar@@ i , a lon@@ g@@ time S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o educ@@ ator — she was teach@@ ing in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity , she had all the experience ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ary , knew everything about education , was conne@@ cted with all the teach@@ ers and community mem@@ bers in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od — I con@@ vin@@ ced her to move up from M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity where she was teach@@ ing ."
She took over as ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive direc@@ tor .
"I@@ m@@ medi@@ ately , she made the in@@ ro@@ ads with the teach@@ ers and the parents and the students and everything , and so sud@@ den@@ ly it was actually full every day ."
And what we were trying to off@@ er every day was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion .
The go@@ al was to have a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one r@@ ati@@ o with every one of these students .
"You know , it &apos;s been pro@@ ven that 3@@ 5 to 40 hours a year with on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion , a stud@@ ent can get one gra@@ de level high@@ er ."
"And so most of these students , En@@ gli@@ sh is not spo@@ k@@ en in the home ."
"They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a ch@@ ur@@ ch pe@@ w that I b@@ ou@@ ght in a B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey au@@ ction right there — the parents will sometimes wat@@ ch while their kids are being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"So that was the bas@@ is of it , was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion ."
And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
"If you &apos;re on V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a S@@ tre@@ et within those few blo@@ cks at around 2 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big back@@ p@@ ac@@ ks , or what@@ ever , actually ru@@ n@@ ning to this space , which is very stran@@ ge , because it &apos;s school , in a way ."
But there was something p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical happening there that was just a little bit different .
"And the other thing was , there was no st@@ ig@@ ma ."
"K@@ i@@ ds wer@@ en &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; C@@ en@@ ter@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ K@@ id@@ s@@ -@@ Th@@ at@@ -@@ Ne@@ ed@@ -@@ Mo@@ re@@ -@@ H@@ el@@ p , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a ."
"F@@ i@@ rst of all , it was a pi@@ rate sup@@ ply st@@ ore , which is in@@ san@@ e ."
"And then secon@@ dly , there &apos;s a publi@@ sh@@ ing company in the back ."
"And so our inter@@ ns were actually working at the same ta@@ bl@@ es very often , and sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , compu@@ ter@@ -@@ ne@@ x@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ computer with the students ."
"And so it became a tu@@ tor@@ ing cent@@ er — publi@@ sh@@ ing cent@@ er , is what we called it — and a writ@@ ing cent@@ er ."
"They go in , and they might be working with a high school stud@@ ent actually working on a nov@@ el — because we had very gi@@ f@@ ted kids , too ."
So there &apos;s no st@@ ig@@ ma .
They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a cre@@ ative en@@ de@@ av@@ or .
They &apos;re seeing a@@ du@@ l@@ ts . They &apos;re model@@ ing their behavi@@ or .
"Th@@ ese a@@ du@@ l@@ ts , they &apos;re working in their fiel@@ d ."
"They can le@@ an over , ask a question of one of these a@@ du@@ l@@ ts and it all sort of fe@@ ed@@ s on each other ."
"There &apos;s a lot of c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ pol@@ lin@@ ation . The only problem , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally for the a@@ du@@ l@@ ts working at M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s who ha@@ dn &apos;t ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily b@@ ou@@ ght into all of this when they sig@@ ned up , was that there was just the one ba@@ th@@ room . ( Laughter ) W@@ ith like 60 kids a day , this is a problem ."
"But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids fin@@ ish@@ ing their hom@@ e@@ work in a given day , working on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one , getting all this atten@@ tion — they go home , they &apos;re fin@@ ish@@ ed . They don &apos;t st@@ all ."
They don &apos;t do their hom@@ e@@ work in front of the T@@ V .
"They &apos;re allo@@ wed to go home at 5 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , en@@ jo@@ y their family , en@@ jo@@ y other h@@ ob@@ bi@@ es , get outside , play ."
And that makes a happy family .
A bu@@ n@@ ch of happy famili@@ es in a ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od is a happy community .
A bu@@ n@@ ch of happy comm@@ unities ti@@ ed together is a happy city and a happy world .
"So the key to it all is hom@@ e@@ work ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion ."
"So we started off with about 12 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hun@@ d@@ red ."
"And we now have 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers on our rost@@ er ."
And we make it incredi@@ bly easy to vol@@ un@@ te@@ er .
"The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a mon@@ th , those two hours sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , next to one stud@@ ent , con@@ cent@@ rat@@ ed atten@@ tion , sh@@ ining this be@@ am of light on their work , on their thou@@ ghts and their self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , is going to be absol@@ ut@@ ely trans@@ form@@ ative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before ."
"So we said , &quot; &quot; E@@ ven if you have two hours one S@@ un@@ day every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s par@@ tly why the tu@@ tor cor@@ ps gre@@ w so f@@ ast ."
"Th@@ en we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . ? &quot; &quot; So we started br@@ ing@@ ing in clas@@ ses during the day ."
"So every day , there &apos;s a fiel@@ d tri@@ p where they together create a book — you can see it being ty@@ ped up ab@@ ov@@ e ."
This is one of the clas@@ ses getting way too exc@@ ited about writ@@ ing .
"You just point a cam@@ era at a clas@@ s , and it always looks like this ."
So this is one of the bo@@ oks that they do .
"N@@ ot@@ ice the t@@ it@@ le of the book , &quot; The Bo@@ ok That W@@ as N@@ ever Ch@@ ec@@ ked O@@ ut : T@@ it@@ ani@@ c . &quot;"
"And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce there was a book na@@ med C@@ in@@ dy that was about the T@@ it@@ ani@@ c . &quot; &quot; So , me@@ an@@ while , there &apos;s an a@@ du@@ l@@ t in the back ty@@ ping this up , taking it completely seri@@ ously , which blo@@ ws their mind ."
So then we still had more tu@@ tors to use .
This is a sh@@ ot of just some of the tu@@ tors during one of the ev@@ ents .
The teach@@ ers that we work with — and everything is different to teach@@ ers — they tell us what to do .
"We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ul@@ tim@@ ately , completely mal@@ le@@ able . You &apos;re going to tell us ."
"The ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us ."
"The teach@@ ers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most u@@ se@@ ful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the scho@@ ols ?"
"Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily , who don &apos;t have really ac@@ tive parents that are br@@ ing@@ ing them in , or are@@ n &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 people on our tu@@ tor rost@@ er ."
"L@@ et &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teach@@ er will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tu@@ tors for the next five S@@ un@@ days ."
"We &apos;re working on our colle@@ ge es@@ says . S@@ end them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wi@@ re : 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 tu@@ tors ."
W@@ ho@@ ever can make it sig@@ ns up . They go in about a half an h@@ our before the clas@@ s .
"The teach@@ er tel@@ ls them what to do , how to do it , what their tra@@ ining is , what their project is so far ."
"They work under the teach@@ er &apos;s gu@@ i@@ de , and it &apos;s all in one big room ."
"And that &apos;s actually the b@@ ru@@ n@@ t of what we do is , people going stra@@ ight from their work@@ place , stra@@ ight from home , stra@@ ight into the clas@@ s@@ room and working direc@@ tly with the students ."
So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
"Th@@ en another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a clas@@ s@@ room and you can st@@ af@@ f it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the E@@ ver@@ et@@ t M@@ id@@ dle S@@ cho@@ ol W@@ rit@@ ers &apos; R@@ o@@ om , where we de@@ cor@@ ated it in bu@@ c@@ can@@ e@@ er st@@ y@@ le ."
It &apos;s right off the li@@ bra@@ ry . And there we ser@@ ve all 5@@ 2@@ 9 kids in this middle school .
"This is their ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er , the &quot; &quot; S@@ tra@@ igh@@ t-@@ U@@ p Ne@@ ws , &quot; &quot; that has an on@@ going col@@ um@@ n from Ma@@ y@@ or G@@ av@@ in Ne@@ w@@ som in both langu@@ ages — En@@ gli@@ sh and S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"So then one day I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ len@@ de w@@ ro@@ te to us and said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why don &apos;t you as@@ sig@@ n a book with high school students ?"
"I want them to write about how to achi@@ eve pe@@ ace in a viol@@ ent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Th@@ ur@@ good Mar@@ sh@@ all H@@ igh S@@ cho@@ ol , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment to the students ."
"And we said , &quot; &quot; I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ len@@ de is going to read all your es@@ says at the end ."
She &apos;s going to publi@@ sh them in a book .
She &apos;s going to s@@ pon@@ s@@ or the prin@@ ting of this book in pa@@ per@@ back form .
"It &apos;s going to be av@@ ail@@ able in all the bo@@ ok@@ sto@@ res in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a and throu@@ gh@@ out the world , on A@@ ma@@ z@@ on and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audi@@ ence , there was I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ len@@ de on the other end ."
I think we had about 1@@ 70 tu@@ tors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredi@@ bly well .
We had a big par@@ ty at the end .
This is a book that you can find any@@ where . So that led to a seri@@ es of these .
"You can see A@@ my T@@ an s@@ pon@@ so@@ red the next one , &quot; I M@@ ight G@@ et S@@ om@@ e@@ where . &quot;"
And this became an on@@ going thing . M@@ ore and more bo@@ oks .
Now we &apos;re sort of ad@@ di@@ cted to the book thing .
"The kids will work har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be per@@ man@@ ent , know it &apos;s going to be on a sh@@ el@@ f , know that no@@ body can d@@ im@@ in@@ ish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve ho@@ no@@ red their words , ho@@ no@@ red their thou@@ ghts with hun@@ dre@@ ds of hours of five dra@@ f@@ ts , six dra@@ f@@ ts — all this atten@@ tion that we give to their thou@@ ghts ."
"And once they achi@@ eve that level , once they &apos;ve writ@@ ten at that level , they can never go back ."
It &apos;s absol@@ ut@@ ely trans@@ form@@ ative .
And so then they &apos;re all sol@@ d in the st@@ ore . This is ne@@ ar the plan@@ ks .
We s@@ ell all the stud@@ ent bo@@ oks .
"Wh@@ ere else would you put them , right ?"
"So we s@@ ell &apos; em , and then something we@@ ird had been happening with the sto@@ res . The st@@ ore , actually — even though we started out as just a ga@@ g — the st@@ ore actually made money ."
So it was pa@@ ying the r@@ ent .
"And maybe this is just a S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to ju@@ d@@ ge ."
But people would come in — and this was before the pi@@ rate mo@@ vi@@ es and everything !
"It was making a lot of money . N@@ ot a lot of money , but it was pa@@ ying the r@@ ent , pa@@ ying a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time st@@ af@@ f mem@@ ber there ."
There &apos;s the ocean ma@@ ps you can see on the left .
And it became a g@@ at@@ e@@ way to the community .
"P@@ eople would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?"
What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to s@@ we@@ ar on the we@@ b . ( Laughter ) I@@ s that a ru@@ le ? I don &apos;t know .
"They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it ."
"And then right be@@ y@@ ond — there &apos;s u@@ su@@ ally a little cha@@ in there — right be@@ y@@ ond , they would see the kids being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"This is a fiel@@ d tri@@ p going on . And so they would be sh@@ op@@ ping , and they might be more lik@@ ely to bu@@ y some l@@ ard , or mil@@ let for their par@@ ro@@ t , or , you know , a ho@@ ok , or ho@@ ok prote@@ c@@ tor for ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time , all of these things we s@@ ell ."
So the st@@ ore actually did really well .
"But it b@@ rou@@ ght in so many people — teach@@ ers , do@@ nor@@ s , vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , everybody — because it was stre@@ et level . It was open to the public ."
"It wasn &apos;t a no@@ n-@@ prof@@ it bu@@ ri@@ ed , you know , on the 3@@ 0@@ th flo@@ or of some building do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn . It was right in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od that it was ser@@ ving , and it was open all the time to the public ."
"So , it became this sort of we@@ ird , happy ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So all the people I used to know in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;"
"And a lot of them had been form@@ er educ@@ at@@ ors or w@@ ou@@ l@@ d-@@ be educ@@ at@@ ors , so they com@@ b@@ ined with a lot of local desig@@ n@@ ers , local writ@@ ers , and they just took the idea inde@@ pen@@ d@@ ently and they did their own thing ."
They didn &apos;t want to s@@ ell pi@@ rate su@@ pp@@ li@@ es .
They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
"So , kno@@ wing the cri@@ me@@ -@@ fi@@ gh@@ ting community in New York , they op@@ en@@ ed the B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n Su@@ per@@ her@@ o S@@ up@@ ply C@@ om@@ p@@ any ."
This is S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts &apos; great design that did this .
"And this was to make it look sort of like one of those ke@@ y@@ sm@@ ith &apos;s sh@@ op@@ s that has to have every ser@@ vice they &apos;ve ever off@@ er@@ ed , you know , all over there ."
"So they op@@ en@@ ed this place . In@@ side , it &apos;s like a C@@ ost@@ c@@ o for super@@ her@@ o@@ es — all the su@@ pp@@ li@@ es in kind of ba@@ sic form ."
These are all han@@ d@@ made .
"Th@@ ese are all sort of re@@ pur@@ posed other produc@@ ts , or what@@ ever ."
All the p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ging is done by S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts .
"So then you have the v@@ il@@ la@@ in con@@ tain@@ ment un@@ it , where kids put their parents . You have the off@@ ice ."
"This is a little va@@ ul@@ t — you have to put your produc@@ t in there , it goes up an electri@@ c li@@ ft and then the guy behind the coun@@ ter tel@@ ls you that you have to rec@@ ite the vo@@ w of her@@ o@@ ism , which you do , if you want to bu@@ y anything . And it lim@@ its , really , their s@@ al@@ es ."
"Per@@ s@@ on@@ ally , I think it &apos;s a problem ."
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
These are some of the produc@@ ts . These are all han@@ d@@ made .
This is a se@@ cre@@ t id@@ ent@@ ity k@@ it .
"If you want to take on the id@@ ent@@ ity of S@@ ha@@ ro@@ n Bo@@ one , one American f@@ em@@ ale mark@@ et@@ ing ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive from H@@ ob@@ ok@@ en , New J@@ er@@ se@@ y . It &apos;s a full do@@ s@@ si@@ er on everything you would need to know about S@@ ha@@ ro@@ n Bo@@ one ."
"So , this is the ca@@ per@@ y where you get f@@ it@@ ted for your cap@@ e , and then you walk up these three ste@@ el@@ -@@ gra@@ ded step@@ s and then we turn on three hy@@ dra@@ u@@ li@@ c f@@ ans from every side and then you can see the cap@@ e in action ."
"There &apos;s nothing wor@@ se than , you know , getting up there and the cap@@ e is bu@@ n@@ ching up or something like that ."
"So then , the se@@ cre@@ t do@@ or — this is one of the sh@@ el@@ ves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slo@@ w@@ ly op@@ ens ."
You can see it there in the middle next to all the gra@@ p@@ pl@@ ing ho@@ oks .
It op@@ ens and then this is the tu@@ tor@@ ing cent@@ er in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full eff@@ ect !
"But this is — I just want to em@@ p@@ ha@@ size — lo@@ cally fun@@ ded , lo@@ cally built ."
"A@@ ll the desig@@ n@@ ers , all of the buil@@ ders , everybody was local , all the time was pro@@ -@@ b@@ ono ."
"I just came and vis@@ ited and said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or what@@ ever . That was it . You can see the time in all five bo@@ rou@@ gh@@ s of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tu@@ tor@@ ing hours ."
"It &apos;s very bu@@ sy . S@@ ame prin@@ ci@@ ples : on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion , compl@@ ete dev@@ ot@@ ion to the students &apos; work and a b@@ oun@@ dl@@ ess op@@ tim@@ ism and sort of a pos@@ sibil@@ ity of cre@@ ativ@@ ity and ideas ."
"And this sw@@ it@@ ch is f@@ lic@@ ked in their he@@ ads when they walk through those 18 fe@@ et of this biz@@ ar@@ re st@@ ore , right ?"
"So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school ."
"It &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly not school , even though they &apos;re working sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der on ta@@ bl@@ es , pen@@ c@@ il@@ s and pa@@ per@@ s , what@@ ever ."
"This is one of the students , K@@ hal@@ ed H@@ am@@ d@@ an ."
You can read this quot@@ e .
A@@ d@@ di@@ cted to video g@@ am@@ es and T@@ V . C@@ ouldn &apos;t con@@ cent@@ rate at home .
C@@ ame in . G@@ ot this con@@ cent@@ rat@@ ed atten@@ tion .
And he couldn &apos;t es@@ cap@@ e it .
"So , so@@ on enough , he was writ@@ ing . He would fin@@ ish his hom@@ e@@ work early — got really ad@@ di@@ cted to fin@@ ish@@ ing his hom@@ e@@ work early ."
"It &apos;s an ad@@ di@@ ctive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it ch@@ ec@@ ked , and to know he &apos;s going to achi@@ eve the next thing and be pre@@ pa@@ red for school the next day ."
"So he got ho@@ ok@@ ed on that , and then he started doing other things ."
He &apos;s now been publi@@ shed in five bo@@ oks .
"He co@@ -@@ w@@ ro@@ te a mo@@ c@@ ku@@ men@@ t@@ ary about fa@@ il@@ ed super@@ her@@ o@@ es called &quot; &quot; Su@@ per@@ -@@ H@@ as@@ -@@ B@@ e@@ ens . &quot; &quot; He w@@ ro@@ te a seri@@ es on &quot; &quot; P@@ en@@ gu@@ in B@@ al@@ bo@@ a , &quot; &quot; which is a fi@@ gh@@ ting — a bo@@ x@@ ing — pen@@ gu@@ in ."
"And then he read al@@ ou@@ d just a few we@@ eks ago to 500 people at S@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ ony S@@ p@@ ace , at a ben@@ ef@@ it for 8@@ 2@@ 6 New York . So he &apos;s there every day ."
He &apos;s ev@@ ang@@ el@@ ical about it . He br@@ ings his cou@@ sin@@ s in now .
There &apos;s four family mem@@ bers that come in every day .
"So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly ."
"This is L@@ .@@ A@@ . , The E@@ ch@@ o Par@@ k T@@ im@@ e T@@ rav@@ el Mar@@ t : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en@@ ever You A@@ re , We &apos;re Al@@ ready Th@@ en . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven for time trav@@ el@@ ers ."
So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven would be .
Le@@ ech@@ es . M@@ am@@ mot@@ h ch@@ un@@ ks . They even have their own S@@ l@@ ur@@ pe@@ e machine : &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of O@@ r@@ der . C@@ ome B@@ ack Y@@ ester@@ day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) A@@ ny@@ way . So I &apos;m going to ju@@ m@@ p a@@ head .

Now I &apos;m going to the TED W@@ ish — is that o@@ kay ?
"A@@ ll right , I &apos;ve got a minut@@ e . So , the TED W@@ ish : I w@@ ish that you — you person@@ ally and every cre@@ ative individu@@ al and organiz@@ ation you know — will find a way to direc@@ tly eng@@ age with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got invol@@ ved , so that within a year we have a thou@@ s@@ and exam@@ ples — a thou@@ s@@ and ! — of trans@@ form@@ ative part@@ ner@@ shi@@ ps ."
Pro@@ found le@@ ap@@ s for@@ ward !
And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
"I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and in@@ spi@@ re others on the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite ."
We created a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite .
"I &apos;m going to sw@@ it@@ ch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the atten@@ de@@ es of this con@@ fer@@ ence will ush@@ er in a new era of parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation in our public scho@@ ols ."
We hope that you will take the le@@ ad in part@@ ner@@ ing your innov@@ ative spi@@ ri@@ t and ex@@ per@@ ti@@ se with that of innov@@ ative educ@@ at@@ ors in your community .
Al@@ ways let the teach@@ ers le@@ ad the way .
They will tell you how to be u@@ se@@ ful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
There are a million ways .
You can walk up to your local school and con@@ sul@@ t with the teach@@ ers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
"So , this is with H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o in S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , they did this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al job ."
"This we@@ b@@ s@@ ite is already up , it &apos;s already got a bu@@ n@@ ch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce U@@ po@@ n a S@@ cho@@ ol , &quot; &quot; which is a great t@@ it@@ le , I think ."
"This s@@ ite will do@@ cu@@ ment every story , every project that comes out of this con@@ fer@@ ence and around the world . So you go to the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , you see a bu@@ n@@ ch of ideas you can be in@@ spi@@ red by and then you ad@@ d your own pro@@ jects once you get started ."
"H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o did a great job in a very ti@@ ght de@@ a@@ dl@@ ine . So , vi@@ sit the s@@ ite ."
"If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our direc@@ tor of national progra@@ ms . He &apos;ll be on the phone ."
"You em@@ a@@ il him , he &apos;ll answer any question you pos@@ si@@ bly want ."
And he &apos;ll get you in@@ spi@@ red and get you going and gu@@ i@@ de you through the process so that you can aff@@ ect change .
And it can be fu@@ n ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it need@@ n &apos;t be ster@@ ile . It need@@ n &apos;t be bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ r@@ ati@@ cally un@@ ten@@ able .
You can do and use the sk@@ ill@@ s that you have .
The scho@@ ols need you . The teach@@ ers need you .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents and parents need you . They need your ac@@ tual person : your physi@@ cal person@@ ho@@ od and your open min@@ ds and open ear@@ s and b@@ oun@@ dl@@ ess comp@@ as@@ sion , sit@@ ting next to them , list@@ ening and no@@ d@@ ding and as@@ king questions for hours at a time ."
S@@ ome of these kids just don &apos;t pla@@ in know how good they are : how sm@@ art and how much they have to say .
"You can tell them . You can sh@@ ine that light on them , one human inter@@ action at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll jo@@ in us ."
Thank you so much .
( Mu@@ sic ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
And I say &quot; &quot; th@@ ank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was sil@@ ent for 1@@ 7 years .
"And the first words that I spo@@ ke were in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , on the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth D@@ ay ."
And my family and friends had ga@@ ther@@ ed there to hear me speak .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audi@@ ence , she ju@@ mp@@ ed up , &quot; H@@ all@@ el@@ u@@ jah , J@@ oh@@ n@@ ny ’ s talking ! &quot;"
"( Laughter ) I@@ mag@@ ine if you were qui@@ et for 1@@ 7 years and your mother was out in the audi@@ ence , say ."
"My da@@ d said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll expla@@ in that ."
But I turned around because I didn ’ t recogniz@@ e where my vo@@ ice was coming from .
"I ha@@ dn ’ t heard my vo@@ ice in 1@@ 7 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; G@@ od , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;"
"And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of l@@ augh@@ ed ."
"And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is c@@ raz@@ y . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this jour@@ ney ."
"And the jour@@ ney , I believe , is a met@@ ap@@ h@@ or for all of our jour@@ ne@@ ys ."
"E@@ ven though this one is kind of un@@ u@@ su@@ al , I want you to think about your own jour@@ ney ."
"My jour@@ ney beg@@ an in 19@@ 7@@ 1 when I w@@ it@@ nes@@ sed two oil tan@@ k@@ ers col@@ li@@ de ben@@ e@@ ath the G@@ ol@@ den G@@ ate , and a half a million g@@ all@@ ons of oil sp@@ ill@@ ed into the b@@ ay ."
It dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in mot@@ or@@ iz@@ ed ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les .
That ’ s a big thing in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
"And it was a big thing in my little community of Po@@ in@@ t Re@@ yes S@@ t@@ ation in In@@ ver@@ ness , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , because there were only about 3@@ 50 people there in the win@@ ter – this was back in &apos; 7@@ 1 now ."
"And so when I came in and I started wal@@ king around , people — they just knew what was going on ."
"And people would dri@@ ve up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; J@@ oh@@ n , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m wal@@ king for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re wal@@ king to make us look bad , right ?"
"You ’ re wal@@ king to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some tru@@ th to that , because I thought that if I started wal@@ king , everyone would fol@@ low ."
"Because of the oil , everybody tal@@ ked about the pol@@ l@@ lu@@ tion ."
"And so I argu@@ ed with people about that , I argu@@ ed and I argu@@ ed ."
I called my parents up .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in car@@ s . &quot; &quot; My da@@ d said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 1@@ 6 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then ."
They ’ re back in P@@ h@@ il@@ a@@ del@@ ph@@ ia .
"And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ thers are like that ."
"And so , on my 2@@ 7@@ th bir@@ th@@ day I decided , because I argu@@ ed so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop spe@@ a@@ king for just one day — one day — to give it a re@@ st ."
And so I did .
I got up in the mor@@ ning and I didn ’ t say a word .
"And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I beg@@ an list@@ ening — in a long time ."
"And what I heard , it kind of dist@@ ur@@ bed me ."
"Because what I used to do , when I thought I was list@@ ening , was I would list@@ en just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I sto@@ pped list@@ ening ."
"And in my mind , I just kind of ra@@ ced a@@ head and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still fin@@ ish@@ ing up ."
And then I would lau@@ n@@ ch in .
"Well , that just en@@ ded communic@@ ation ."
So on this first day I actually list@@ en@@ ed .
"And it was very sa@@ d for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning ."
I was 2@@ 7 . I thought I knew everything .
I didn ’ t .
"And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I pro@@ mis@@ ed myself for a year I would keep qui@@ et because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more ."
"So for a year I said I would keep qui@@ et , and then on my bir@@ th@@ day I would reas@@ s@@ ess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again ."
"Well , that la@@ st@@ ed 1@@ 7 years ."
"Now during that time — those 1@@ 7 years — I wal@@ ked and I pla@@ yed the ban@@ j@@ o and I pain@@ ted and I w@@ ro@@ te in my jour@@ nal , and I tri@@ ed to study the environment by read@@ ing bo@@ oks ."
And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
"I wal@@ ked up to A@@ shl@@ and , O@@ reg@@ on , where they were off@@ ering an environ@@ mental studi@@ es de@@ gre@@ e ."
It ’ s only 500 mil@@ es .
"And I went into the Re@@ gi@@ stra@@ r ’ s off@@ ice and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;"
I had a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er c@@ li@@ pp@@ ing .
"&quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?"
You don ’ t … ?
We have a speci@@ al progra@@ m for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
"And in those two years , I gradu@@ ated with my first de@@ gre@@ e — a ba@@ chel@@ or ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ."
"And my father came out , he was so pro@@ u@@ d ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , we ’ re really pro@@ u@@ d of you son , but what are you going to do with a ba@@ chel@@ or ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ?"
"You don ’ t ri@@ de in car@@ s , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hun@@ ched my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , I pic@@ ked my back@@ p@@ ack up again and I started wal@@ king ."
"I wal@@ ked all the way up to P@@ or@@ t T@@ ow@@ n@@ sen@@ d , W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , where I built a wo@@ od@@ en bo@@ at , ro@@ de it across P@@ u@@ get S@@ ound and wal@@ ked across W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton &#91; to &#93; I@@ da@@ ho and down to M@@ is@@ s@@ ou@@ la , M@@ on@@ t@@ ana ."
I had writ@@ ten the Uni@@ vers@@ ity of M@@ on@@ t@@ ana two years ear@@ li@@ er and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
( Laughter ) And I was there . I sho@@ wed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really hel@@ ped me .
There are two stories in M@@ on@@ t@@ ana .
The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sig@@ n I used a lot .
"And they said , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that . &quot; &quot; The direc@@ tor of the progra@@ m said , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome back tom@@ or@@ row . &quot; &quot; He gave me 1@@ 50 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Re@@ gi@@ ster for one cre@@ dit ."
"You ’ re going to go to S@@ outh America , are@@ n ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — R@@ i@@ ver@@ s and la@@ k@@ es , the hy@@ dro@@ lo@@ g@@ ical systems , S@@ outh America ."
So I did that .
"He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK J@@ oh@@ n , now that you &apos;ve regi@@ ster@@ ed for that one cre@@ dit , you can have a key to an off@@ ice , you can mat@@ ri@@ cul@@ ate — you ’ re mat@@ ri@@ cul@@ ating , so you can use the li@@ bra@@ ry ."
"And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the profes@@ sor@@ s al@@ low you to go to clas@@ s ."
"They ’ re going to s@@ ave your gra@@ de , and when we figure out how to get you the re@@ st of the money , then you can regi@@ ster for that clas@@ s and they ’ ll give you the gra@@ de . &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , they don ’ t do that in gradu@@ ate scho@@ ols , I don ’ t think ."
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
"They saw that I was really interest@@ ed in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way ."
"And during that time , I actually ta@@ u@@ ght clas@@ ses without spe@@ a@@ king ."
I had 1@@ 3 students when I first wal@@ ked into the clas@@ s .
"I expla@@ ined , with a friend who could inter@@ pre@@ t my sig@@ n language , that I was J@@ oh@@ n Fran@@ c@@ is , I was wal@@ king around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here inter@@ pre@@ ting for me ."
All the students s@@ at around and they went ...
"( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the sch@@ e@@ du@@ le , to see when they could get out ."
They had to take that clas@@ s with me .
"T@@ w@@ o we@@ eks later , everyone was trying to get into our clas@@ s ."
And I learned in that clas@@ s — because I would do things like this ...
"@@ and they were all ga@@ ther@@ ed around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear c@@ ut@@ ting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear c@@ ut@@ ting . &quot;"
"&quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear c@@ ut@@ ting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a han@@ d@@ saw . &quot;"
"&quot; Well , you can ’ t c@@ lear@@ c@@ ut with a ... &quot;"
"&quot; Y@@ es , you can clear c@@ ut ... &quot;"
"&quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about sel@@ ec@@ tive fore@@ stry . &quot;"
Now this was a disc@@ us@@ sion clas@@ s and we were having a disc@@ us@@ sion .
"I just bac@@ ked out of that , you know , and I just kind of k@@ ept the fi@@ sts from fl@@ ying ."
"But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sig@@ n and they said things that I absol@@ ut@@ ely did not mean , but I should have ."
"And so what came to me is , if you were a teach@@ er and you were teach@@ ing , if you wer@@ en ’ t learning you probably wer@@ en ’ t teach@@ ing very well ."
And so I went on .
"My da@@ d came out to see me gradu@@ ate and , you know , I did the de@@ al , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really pro@@ u@@ d of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving and start talking ."
"What are you going to do with a ma@@ ster ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ? &quot; &quot; I hun@@ ched my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , I got my back@@ p@@ ack and I went on to the Uni@@ vers@@ ity of W@@ is@@ con@@ s@@ in ."
I sp@@ ent two years there writ@@ ing on oil sp@@ ill@@ s .
No one was interest@@ ed in oil sp@@ ill@@ s .
But something happened — E@@ x@@ x@@ on V@@ al@@ de@@ z .
And I was the only one in the United States writ@@ ing on oil sp@@ ill@@ s .
My da@@ d came out again .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ri@@ de in car@@ s , you don ’ t talk ."
"My sist@@ er said maybe I should leave you alone , because you se@@ em to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my back@@ p@@ ack again ."
"I put my ban@@ j@@ o on and I wal@@ ked all the way to the E@@ ast C@@ o@@ ast , put my fo@@ ot in the A@@ t@@ lan@@ ti@@ c O@@ c@@ ean — it was se@@ ven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States ."
"And on Earth D@@ ay , 199@@ 0 — the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth D@@ ay — that ’ s when I beg@@ an to speak ."
"And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that tre@@ e in the fore@@ st f@@ all@@ ing ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?"
"And I ’ m th@@ an@@ king you , and I &apos;m th@@ an@@ king my family because they had come to hear me speak ."
And that ’ s communic@@ ation .
And they also ta@@ u@@ ght me about list@@ ening — that they list@@ en@@ ed to me .
"And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the sil@@ ence , the list@@ ening to each other ."
"R@@ e@@ ally , very important — we need to list@@ en to each other ."
"Well , my jour@@ ney k@@ ept going on ."
"My da@@ d said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go ."
"I worked for the C@@ o@@ ast@@ gu@@ ard , was made a U.@@ N@@ . Go@@ od@@ will A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"I w@@ ro@@ te regul@@ ations for the United States — I mean , I w@@ ro@@ te oil sp@@ ill regul@@ ations ."
"@@ 20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; J@@ oh@@ n , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;"
"&quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; You just start wal@@ king e@@ ast ; get out of your car and just start wal@@ king e@@ ast . &quot; &quot; And as I wal@@ ked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and sh@@ ut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , bud@@ dy . &quot;"
"H@@ ow could that be , how could that be ?"
How could doing such a simple thing like wal@@ king and not talking make a difference ?
"Well , my time at the C@@ o@@ ast G@@ u@@ ard was a really good time ."
"And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at and I sa@@ il@@ ed down to the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , and wal@@ ked through all of the is@@ lan@@ ds , and to V@@ en@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ a ."
"And you know , I for@@ got the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you ."
I started talking because I had studi@@ ed environment .
"I ’ d studi@@ ed environment at this form@@ al level , but there was this inform@@ al level ."
"And the inform@@ al level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are ."
And environment changed from just being about tre@@ es and bir@@ ds and en@@ dan@@ ger@@ ed species to being about how we tre@@ ated each other .
"Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we tre@@ at ourselves and how we tre@@ at each other ."
And so that ’ s the mes@@ sage that I had .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to s@@ pre@@ ad that mes@@ sage . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at , sa@@ il@@ ed all the way through the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an — it wasn &apos;t really my sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at , I kind of worked on that bo@@ at — got to V@@ en@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ a and I started wal@@ king ."
"This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ri@@ de in mot@@ or@@ iz@@ ed ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les ."
"I was wal@@ king through E@@ l D@@ or@@ a@@ do — it &apos;s a pri@@ son to@@ wn , fam@@ ous pri@@ son , or in@@ fam@@ ous pri@@ son — in V@@ en@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ a , and I don ’ t know what pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed me , because this was not like me ."
"There I am , wal@@ king past the gu@@ ard g@@ ate and the gu@@ ard sto@@ ps and says , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ a@@ por@@ te , pas@@ a@@ por@@ te , &quot; &quot; and with an M@@ 1@@ 6 poin@@ ted at me ."
"And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ s@@ port , hu@@ h ?"
I don &apos;t need to show you my pas@@ s@@ port . It ’ s in the back of my p@@ ack .
I &apos;m D@@ r@@ . Fran@@ c@@ is ; I &apos;m a U.@@ N@@ . A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or and I &apos;m wal@@ king around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started wal@@ king off .
What pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed me to say this thing ?
The ro@@ ad turned into the ju@@ n@@ g@@ le .
I didn ’ t get sh@@ ot .
"And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree at last — th@@ ank G@@ od Al@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?"
"It took me 100 mil@@ es to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a pri@@ s@@ on@@ er ."
I was a pri@@ s@@ on@@ er and I needed to es@@ cap@@ e .
The pri@@ son that I was in was the fact that I did not dri@@ ve or use mot@@ or@@ iz@@ ed ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les .
Now how could that be ?
"Because when I started , it se@@ em@@ ed very appro@@ pri@@ ate to me not to use mot@@ or@@ iz@@ ed ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les ."
"But the thing that was different was that every bir@@ th@@ day , I asked myself about sil@@ ence , but I never asked myself about my deci@@ sion to just use my fe@@ et ."
I had no idea I was going to become a U.@@ N@@ . A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or .
I had no idea I would have a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ .
"And so I realized that I had a respon@@ sibil@@ ity to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change ."
"You know , we can do it ."
I was going to have to change .
"And I was af@@ ra@@ id to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just wal@@ ked ."
I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
But I know I needed to .
"I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today ."
"And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve got@@ ten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go ."
"And we kind of have to leave behind the se@@ cur@@ ity of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are be@@ coming ."
"And so , I want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you to go to that next place , to let y@@ ourself out of any pri@@ son that you might find y@@ ourself in , as com@@ for@@ table as it may be , because we have to do something now ."
We have to change now .
"As our form@@ er V@@ ice P@@ re@@ sid@@ ent said , we have to become ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts ."
"So if my vo@@ ice can tou@@ ch you , if my ac@@ tions can tou@@ ch you , if my being here can tou@@ ch you , ple@@ ase let it be ."
And I know that all of you have tou@@ ched me while I ’ ve been here .
"So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this car@@ ing , this love , this re@@ spe@@ ct that we ’ ve sho@@ wn each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world ."
"Because we are the environment , and how we tre@@ at each other is really how we ’ re going to tre@@ at the environment ."
So I want to th@@ ank you for being here and I want to end this in five secon@@ ds of sil@@ ence .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the l@@ at@@ est ep@@ is@@ ode of India &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — lon@@ g@@ est ru@@ n@@ ning so@@ a@@ p oper@@ a , which is cri@@ ck@@ et ."
"And may it run fore@@ ver , because it gi@@ ves people like me a living ."
"It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a norm@@ al so@@ a@@ p oper@@ a to want : It &apos;s got love , jo@@ y , happ@@ in@@ ess , sa@@ d@@ ness , te@@ ar@@ s , l@@ aughter , lots of dec@@ e@@ it , in@@ tri@@ gu@@ e ."
"And like all good so@@ ap@@ s , it ju@@ m@@ ps 20 years when the audi@@ ence inter@@ est changes ."
And that &apos;s exactly what cri@@ ck@@ et has done .
It &apos;s ju@@ mp@@ ed 20 years into 20@@ -@@ over game .
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change lea@@ ds to a very big revol@@ ution ."
But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
C@@ ri@@ ck@@ et wasn &apos;t always this spe@@ ed@@ -@@ dri@@ ven gener@@ ations game .
"There was a time when you pla@@ yed cri@@ ck@@ et , you pla@@ yed tim@@ el@@ ess test mat@@ ch@@ es , when you pla@@ yed on t@@ ill the game got over ."
And there was this game in Mar@@ ch 19@@ 3@@ 9 that started on the third of Mar@@ ch and en@@ ded on the 1@@ 4@@ th of Mar@@ ch .
"And it only en@@ ded because the En@@ gli@@ sh cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ers had to go from D@@ ur@@ b@@ an to C@@ ape T@@ own , which is a tw@@ o-@@ h@@ our tra@@ in jour@@ ney , to cat@@ ch the ship that left on the 1@@ 7@@ th , because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time ."
"So , the mat@@ ch was en@@ ded in between ."
"And one of the En@@ gli@@ sh bat@@ sm@@ en said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
A@@ no@@ ther half an h@@ our and we would have won . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A@@ no@@ ther half an h@@ our after 12 days .
"There were two S@@ un@@ days in between . But of course , S@@ un@@ days are ch@@ ur@@ ch days , so you don &apos;t play on S@@ un@@ days . And one day it ra@@ ined , so they all s@@ at around making friends with each other ."
But there is a reason why India f@@ ell in love with cri@@ ck@@ et : because we had about the same p@@ ace of life .
"( Laughter ) The Ma@@ h@@ ab@@ har@@ at@@ a was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?"
"You f@@ ou@@ ght by day , then it was su@@ n@@ set , so everyone went back home ."
"And then you worked out your strate@@ gy , and you came and f@@ ou@@ ght the next day , and you went back home again ."
"The only difference between the Ma@@ h@@ ab@@ har@@ at@@ a and our cri@@ ck@@ et was that in cri@@ ck@@ et , everybody was ali@@ ve to come back and fi@@ ght the next day ."
"P@@ rin@@ ces pat@@ ron@@ ize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ing@@ r@@ ati@@ ating themselves to the B@@ rit@@ ish ru@@ l@@ ers ."
"But there is one other reason why India f@@ ell in love with cri@@ ck@@ et , which was , all you needed was a plan@@ k of wo@@ od and a ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ all , and any number of people could play it any@@ where ."
"Ta@@ ke a look : You could play it in the dum@@ p with some ro@@ cks over there , you could play it in a little al@@ le@@ y — you couldn &apos;t h@@ it squ@@ are any@@ where , because the b@@ at h@@ it the w@@ all ; don &apos;t for@@ get the air cond@@ iti@@ on@@ ing and the c@@ able wi@@ res ."
( Laughter ) You could play it on the ban@@ ks of the G@@ ang@@ es — that &apos;s as cle@@ an as the G@@ ang@@ es has been for a long time .
"O@@ r you could play many g@@ am@@ es in one small pat@@ ch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in ."
"( Laughter ) A@@ s you can see , you can play any@@ where ."
"But slo@@ w@@ ly the game mo@@ ved on , you know , finally ."
"You don &apos;t always have five days . So , we mo@@ ved on , and we started pla@@ ying 5@@ 0-@@ over cri@@ ck@@ et ."
And then an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous ac@@ ci@@ dent took place .
"In Indi@@ an s@@ port we don &apos;t make things happen , ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes ."
And we won this Wor@@ ld C@@ up in 19@@ 8@@ 3 .
"And sud@@ den@@ ly we f@@ ell in love with the 5@@ 0-@@ over game , and we pla@@ yed it vir@@ tually every day ."
There was more 5@@ 0-@@ over cri@@ ck@@ et than any@@ where .
But there was another big d@@ ate .
19@@ 8@@ 3 was when we won the Wor@@ ld C@@ up .
"@@ 199@@ 1 , &apos; 9@@ 2 , we found a fin@@ ance min@@ ist@@ er and a pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er w@@ ill@@ ing to let the world look at India , rather than be this great country of in@@ tri@@ gu@@ e and my@@ st@@ ery in this clo@@ sed country ."
And so we allo@@ wed mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als into India .
"We c@@ ut cu@@ st@@ om@@ s du@@ ti@@ es , we re@@ duc@@ ed im@@ port du@@ ti@@ es , and we got all the mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als coming in , with mul@@ tin@@ ational bud@@ gets , who looked at per@@ -@@ cap@@ it@@ a in@@ come and got very exc@@ ited about the pos@@ sibil@@ ities in India , and were looking for a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le to re@@ ach every Indi@@ an ."
"And there are only two ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les in India — one real , one sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ted ."
"The sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ted one is what you see in the mo@@ vi@@ es , the real one was cri@@ ck@@ et ."
"And so one of my friends sit@@ ting right here in front of me , R@@ av@@ i D@@ h@@ ari@@ w@@ al from P@@ ep@@ s@@ i , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world ."
"And P@@ ep@@ s@@ i was this big revol@@ ution , because they started taking cri@@ ck@@ et all over ."
And so cri@@ ck@@ et started be@@ coming big ; cri@@ ck@@ et started br@@ ing@@ ing ri@@ ch@@ es in .
"T@@ ele@@ vision started c@@ over@@ ing cri@@ ck@@ et . F@@ or a long time tele@@ vision said , &quot; &quot; We won &apos;t c@@ over cri@@ ck@@ et un@@ less you p@@ ay us to c@@ over it . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en they said , &quot; &quot; OK , the next ri@@ ghts are sol@@ d for 5@@ 5 million dollars ."
"The next ri@@ ghts are sol@@ d for 6@@ 12 million dollars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a cur@@ ve , that ."
And then another big ac@@ ci@@ dent happened in our cri@@ ck@@ et .
"E@@ n@@ gl@@ and inv@@ ented 20 ov@@ ers cri@@ ck@@ et , and said , &quot; &quot; The world must play 20 ov@@ ers cri@@ ck@@ et . &quot; &quot; Ju@@ st as En@@ gl@@ and inv@@ ented cri@@ ck@@ et , and made the re@@ st of the world play it ."
Thank G@@ od for them .
"( Laughter ) And so , India had to go and play the T@@ 20 Wor@@ ld C@@ up , you see ."
India didn &apos;t want to play the T@@ 20 Wor@@ ld C@@ up .
But we were for@@ ced to play it by an 8@@ -@@ 1 mar@@ g@@ in .
And then something very dra@@ m@@ atic happened .
"We got to the fin@@ al , and then this moment , that will re@@ ma@@ in en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed fore@@ ver , for everybody , take a look ."
( C@@ ro@@ w@@ d che@@ ering ) The P@@ a@@ ki@@ stan@@ i bat@@ sm@@ an trying to clear the fiel@@ der .
An@@ no@@ un@@ cer : And Z@@ ish@@ an takes it ! India w@@ ins !
What a mat@@ ch for a T@@ w@@ ent@@ y@@ 20 fin@@ al .
"In@@ di@@ a , the world ch@@ am@@ pi@@ ons ."
"( Ch@@ e@@ ering ) India , T@@ 20 ch@@ am@@ pi@@ ons ."
"But what a game we had , M@@ . S. D@@ h@@ oni got it right in the air , but M@@ is@@ ba@@ h@@ -@@ ul@@ -@@ H@@ a@@ q , what a pla@@ y@@ er ."
"A mas@@ sive , mas@@ sive succ@@ ess : India , the world T@@ T ch@@ am@@ pi@@ ons ."
H@@ ar@@ sh@@ a B@@ ho@@ g@@ le : S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly India discover@@ ed this power of 20@@ -@@ ov@@ ers cri@@ ck@@ et .
"The ac@@ ci@@ dent , of course , there , was that the bat@@ sm@@ an thought the bo@@ w@@ l@@ er was bo@@ w@@ ling f@@ ast ."
"( Laughter ) If he had bo@@ w@@ led f@@ ast , the b@@ all would have gone where it was me@@ ant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we sud@@ den@@ ly discover@@ ed that we could be good at this game ."
And what it also did was it led to a certain pri@@ de in the fact that India could be the best in the world .
"It was at a time when invest@@ ment was coming in , India was feel@@ ing a little more con@@ fi@@ dent about itself ."
And so there was a feel@@ ing that there was great pri@@ de in what we can do .
"And th@@ an@@ k@@ fully for all of us , the En@@ gli@@ sh are very good at inv@@ ent@@ ing things , and then the gra@@ ci@@ ous people that they are , they let the world become very good at it ."
"( Laughter ) And so En@@ gl@@ and inv@@ ented T@@ 20 cri@@ ck@@ et , and allo@@ wed India to hi@@ ja@@ ck it ."
"It was not like re@@ engine@@ ering that we do in medi@@ c@@ ine , we just took it stra@@ ight away , as is ."
"( Laughter ) And so , we lau@@ n@@ ched our own T@@ 20 le@@ ag@@ ue ."
"S@@ i@@ x we@@ eks , city ver@@ su@@ s city ."
"It was a new thing for us . We had only ever sup@@ por@@ ted our country — the only two are@@ as in which India was very pro@@ u@@ d about their country , re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing itself on the fiel@@ d ."
"One was war , the Indi@@ an ar@@ my , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often ."
The other was Indi@@ an cri@@ ck@@ et .
"Now , sud@@ den@@ ly we had to sup@@ port city le@@ ag@@ ues ."
But the people getting into these city le@@ ag@@ ues were people who were taking their cu@@ es from the W@@ est .
"A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a is a home of le@@ ag@@ ues . And they said , &quot; R@@ ight , we &apos;ll build some gl@@ it@@ zy le@@ ag@@ ues here in India . &quot;"
But was India ready for it ?
"Because cri@@ ck@@ et , for a long time in India was always organiz@@ ed ."
"It was never pro@@ mot@@ ed , it was never sol@@ d — it was organiz@@ ed ."
"And look what they did with our beautiful , ni@@ ce , simple family game ."
"A@@ ll of a sud@@ den , you had that happening ."
( Mu@@ sic ) A@@ n op@@ ening cer@@ em@@ ony to mat@@ ch every other .
This was an India that was bu@@ ying C@@ or@@ vet@@ t@@ es . This was an India that was bu@@ ying J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar .
This was an India that was ad@@ ding more mobil@@ e ph@@ ones per mon@@ th than New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and &apos;s population tw@@ ice over .
"So , it was a different India ."
"But it was also a sli@@ gh@@ tly more or@@ th@@ od@@ o@@ x India that was very happy to be mo@@ der@@ n , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people ."
"And so , they were a@@ gh@@ ast when the che@@ er@@ lea@@ ders ar@@ ri@@ ved ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ one se@@ cre@@ tly wat@@ ched them , but everyone c@@ la@@ im@@ ed not to ."
( Mu@@ sic ) ( Laughter ) The new ow@@ n@@ ers of Indi@@ an cri@@ ck@@ et were not the old prin@@ ces .
They were not bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ rat@@ s who were for@@ ced into s@@ port because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who ran seri@@ ous companies .
"And so they started pro@@ mot@@ ing cri@@ ck@@ et big time , started pro@@ mot@@ ing clu@@ b@@ s big time ."
And they &apos;ve started pro@@ mot@@ ing them with huge money behind it .
"I mean the I@@ P@@ L had 2@@ .@@ 3 billion dollars before a b@@ all was bo@@ w@@ led , 1@@ .@@ 6 billion dollars for tele@@ vision re@@ ven@@ ue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars pl@@ us from all these f@@ ran@@ ch@@ is@@ es that were put@@ ting in money . And then they had to appe@@ al to their cities , but they had to do it like the W@@ est , right ? Because we are set@@ ting up le@@ ag@@ ues ."
But what they were very good at doing was making it very lo@@ c@@ aliz@@ ed .
"So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not M@@ an@@ ch@@ est@@ er United st@@ y@@ le pro@@ mot@@ ion , but very M@@ um@@ ba@@ i st@@ y@@ le pro@@ mot@@ ion . Ta@@ ke a look ."
"( Mu@@ sic ) O@@ f course , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ybe they dan@@ ce better than they play . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cri@@ ck@@ et ."
"A@@ ll along , if you wanted a young cri@@ ck@@ et@@ er , you pic@@ ked him up from the byl@@ an@@ es of your own little lo@@ c@@ ality , your own city , and you were very pro@@ u@@ d of the system that produc@@ ed those cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ers ."
"Now , all of the sud@@ den , if you were to bo@@ w@@ l a sh@@ ot — if M@@ um@@ ba@@ i were to bo@@ w@@ l a sh@@ ot , for example , they need@@ n &apos;t go to K@@ al@@ ba@@ dev@@ i or S@@ hi@@ va@@ j@@ i Par@@ k or some@@ where to sour@@ ce them , they could go to T@@ rin@@ i@@ da@@ d ."
"This was the new India , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can sour@@ ce from any@@ where as long as you get the best produc@@ t at the best pri@@ ce ."
"And all of a sud@@ den , Indi@@ an s@@ port had aw@@ ak@@ en@@ ed to the reality that you can sour@@ ce the best produc@@ t for the best pri@@ ce any@@ where in the world ."
"So , the M@@ um@@ ba@@ i Indi@@ ans fle@@ w in D@@ wa@@ y@@ ne B@@ rav@@ o from T@@ rin@@ i@@ da@@ d and T@@ ob@@ ago , over@@ night . And when he had to go back to re@@ present the W@@ est Indi@@ es , they asked him , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en do you have to re@@ ach ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I have to be there by a certain time , so I have to leave today . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . It &apos;s not about when you have to leave ; it &apos;s about when do you have to re@@ ach there ? &quot; &quot; And so he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to re@@ ach on d@@ ate X@@ . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine , you play to d@@ ate X , min@@ us one . &quot; &quot; So , he pla@@ yed in H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , went , stra@@ ight after the game ,"
"@@ went from the sta@@ di@@ um to H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad air@@ port , s@@ at in a priv@@ ate cor@@ por@@ ate j@@ et — first re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing in P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al , second re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing in B@@ raz@@ il ; he was in W@@ est Indi@@ es in time ."
( Laughter ) N@@ ever would India have thought on this scale before .
"N@@ ever would India have said , &quot; &quot; I want a pla@@ y@@ er to play one game for me , and I will use a cor@@ por@@ ate j@@ et to sen@@ d him all the way back to K@@ ing@@ st@@ on , J@@ am@@ a@@ ic@@ a to play a game . &quot; &quot; And I just thought to myself , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , we &apos;ve ar@@ ri@@ ved some@@ where in the world , you know ?"
"We have ar@@ ri@@ ved some@@ where . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started mar@@ ry@@ ing the two most important things in Indi@@ an cri@@ ck@@ et , which is cri@@ ck@@ et and the mo@@ vi@@ es in Indi@@ an en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment ."
There is cri@@ ck@@ et and the mo@@ vi@@ es .
And they came together because people in the mo@@ vi@@ es now started ow@@ ning clu@@ b@@ s .
"And so , people started going to the cri@@ ck@@ et to wat@@ ch P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta ."
They started going to the cri@@ ck@@ et to wat@@ ch S@@ ha@@ h R@@ u@@ k@@ h K@@ h@@ an .
And something very interesting happened .
We started getting s@@ ong and dan@@ ce in Indi@@ an cri@@ ck@@ et .
And so it started re@@ sem@@ bl@@ ing the Indi@@ an mo@@ vi@@ es more and more .
"And of course , if you were on P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta &apos;s team — as you will see on the c@@ li@@ p that fol@@ lo@@ ws — if you did well , you got a hu@@ g from P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta ."
So that was the ul@@ tim@@ ate reason to do well . Ta@@ ke a look — everyone &apos;s wat@@ ching P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta .
( Mu@@ sic ) And then of course there was S@@ ha@@ h R@@ u@@ k@@ h pla@@ ying the K@@ ol@@ kat@@ a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d .
"We &apos;d all seen mat@@ ch@@ es in K@@ ol@@ kat@@ a , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : S@@ ha@@ h R@@ u@@ k@@ h , with the B@@ eng@@ ali s@@ ong , getting the audi@@ ences all worked up for K@@ ol@@ kat@@ a — not for India , but for K@@ ol@@ kat@@ a ."
But take a look at this .
( Mu@@ sic ) A@@ n Indi@@ an fil@@ m st@@ ar hu@@ gg@@ ing a P@@ a@@ ki@@ stan@@ i cri@@ ck@@ et@@ er because they &apos;d won in K@@ ol@@ kat@@ a .
C@@ an you imagine ?
And do you know what the P@@ a@@ ki@@ stan@@ i cri@@ ck@@ et@@ er said ?
( Applause ) &quot; I w@@ ish I was pla@@ ying for P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta &apos;s team . &quot;
( Laughter ) But I thought I &apos;d take this opport@@ unity — there &apos;s a few people from P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an in here .
"I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?"
"We can play cri@@ ck@@ et together , we can be friends ."
"So th@@ ank you very much for coming , all of you from P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"( Applause ) There was c@@ rit@@ ic@@ ism too because they said , &quot; &quot; P@@ la@@ y@@ ers are being b@@ ou@@ ght and sol@@ d ?"
A@@ re they gra@@ in ?
"A@@ re they cat@@ tle ? &quot; &quot; Because we had this au@@ ction , you see ."
How do you fi@@ x a pri@@ ce for a pla@@ y@@ er ?
"And so the au@@ ction that fol@@ lo@@ wed liter@@ ally had people saying , &quot; B@@ an@@ g ! so many million dollars for so@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ so pla@@ y@@ er . &quot;"
There it is .
"( Mu@@ sic ) A@@ u@@ cti@@ on@@ e@@ er : Go@@ ing at 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars . Ch@@ en@@ na@@ i ."
"S@@ han@@ e W@@ ar@@ ne sol@@ d for 4@@ 5@@ 0,000 dollars ."
"H@@ B : S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly , a game which ear@@ ned its pla@@ y@@ ers 50 ru@@ pe@@ es a day — so 2@@ 50 ru@@ pe@@ es for a test mat@@ ch , but if you fin@@ ish in four days you only got 2@@ 00 ."
"The best Indi@@ an pla@@ y@@ ers who pla@@ yed every test mat@@ ch — every one of the inter@@ n@@ ation@@ als , the top of the line pla@@ y@@ ers — stan@@ d@@ ard con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts are 2@@ 20@@ ,000 dollars in a whole year ."
"Now they were getting 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 for six days &apos; work ."
"Th@@ en An@@ dre@@ w F@@ lin@@ to@@ ff came by from En@@ gl@@ and , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or four we@@ eks , I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than Fran@@ k L@@ am@@ par@@ d and S@@ te@@ ven Ger@@ ra@@ r@@ d , and I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than the fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all@@ ers , w@@ ow . &quot; &quot; And where was he ear@@ ning it from ? F@@ rom a little clu@@ b in India ."
C@@ ould you have imag@@ ined that day would come ?
One and a half million dollars for six we@@ eks &apos; work .
"That &apos;s not bad , is it ?"
"So , at 2@@ .@@ 3 billion dollars before the first b@@ all was bo@@ w@@ led ."
"What India was doing , though , was ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge br@@ and ."
L@@ al@@ it M@@ od@@ i was on the c@@ over of B@@ us@@ in@@ ess T@@ oday .
"I@@ P@@ L became the bi@@ gg@@ est br@@ and in India and , because our elec@@ tions , had to be mo@@ ved to S@@ outh Africa , and we had to start the t@@ our@@ na@@ ment in three we@@ eks ."
M@@ ov@@ e a whole t@@ our@@ na@@ ment to S@@ outh Africa in three we@@ eks .
But we did it . You know why ?
"Because no country works as slo@@ w@@ ly as we do t@@ ill three we@@ eks before an ev@@ ent , and no@@ body works f@@ ast as we do in the last three we@@ eks ."
"( Applause ) O@@ ur population , which for a long time we thought was a problem , sud@@ den@@ ly became our bi@@ gg@@ est as@@ set because there were more people wat@@ ching — the huge con@@ sum@@ ing clas@@ s — everybody came to wat@@ ch the cri@@ ck@@ et ."
"We &apos;d also made cri@@ ck@@ et the only s@@ port in India , which is a p@@ ity , but in India every other s@@ port pu@@ sh@@ es cri@@ ck@@ et to become big , which is a bit of a tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y of our times ."
"Now , this last minut@@ e before I go — there &apos;s a couple of side effec@@ ts of all this ."
"For a long time , India was this country of pover@@ ty , du@@ st , beg@@ gar@@ s , s@@ na@@ ke ch@@ ar@@ mer@@ s , fil@@ th , D@@ el@@ h@@ i bel@@ ly — people heard D@@ el@@ h@@ i bel@@ ly stories before they came ."
"And , all of a sud@@ den , India was this land of opport@@ unity ."
"C@@ ri@@ ck@@ et@@ ers all over the world said , &quot; You know , we love India . We love to play in India . &quot;"
"And that felt good , you know ?"
"We said , &quot; &quot; The dolla@@ r &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot; &quot; C@@ an you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dolla@@ r on view and there &apos;s no D@@ el@@ h@@ i bel@@ ly in there any@@ more ."
"There &apos;s no fil@@ th , there &apos;s no beg@@ gar@@ s , all the s@@ na@@ ke ch@@ ar@@ mer@@ s have v@@ ani@@ shed , everybody &apos;s gone . This tel@@ ls you how the cap@@ it@@ al@@ ist world ru@@ les ."
"R@@ ight so , finally , an En@@ gli@@ sh game that India us@@ ur@@ ped a little bit , but T@@ 20 is going to be the next mis@@ sion@@ ary in the world ."
"If you want to take the game around the world , it &apos;s got to be the shor@@ test form of the game ."
"You can &apos;t take a tim@@ el@@ ess test to China and sit through 1@@ 4 days with no resul@@ t in the end , or you can &apos;t take it all over the world ."
So that &apos;s what T@@ 20 is doing .
"H@@ o@@ pe@@ fully , it &apos;ll make everyone ri@@ ch@@ er , ho@@ pe@@ fully it &apos;ll make the game bi@@ g@@ ger and ho@@ pe@@ fully it &apos;ll give cri@@ ck@@ et com@@ men@@ tat@@ ors more time in the business ."
Thank you very much . Thank you .
( Applause )
"So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a stre@@ et any@@ where in America and a J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese man comes up to you and says , &quot; E@@ x@@ c@@ use me , what is the name of this blo@@ ck ? &quot;"

B@@ lo@@ cks have na@@ m@@ es .

The first house ever built on a blo@@ ck is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
"Th@@ ird is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvi@@ ous . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the op@@ pos@@ ite side of the world to realiz@@ e as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realiz@@ e that the op@@ pos@@ ite of them may also be true ."
"So , for example , there are doc@@ tors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you heal@@ thy ."
"So , any mon@@ th you are heal@@ thy you p@@ ay them , and when you &apos;re si@@ ck you don &apos;t have to p@@ ay them because they fa@@ il@@ ed at their job . They get ri@@ ch when you &apos;re heal@@ thy , not si@@ ck ."
"( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the do@@ w@@ n@@ be@@ at , the beginning of the mu@@ si@@ cal ph@@ ra@@ se : one , two , three , four ."
"But in W@@ est Afri@@ can music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the ph@@ ra@@ se , like the period at the end of a sent@@ ence ."

D@@ om@@ o ar@@ ig@@ a@@ to go@@ za@@ im@@ ash@@ it@@ a .
"So I started working with re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es because I wanted to make a difference , and making a difference star@@ ts with telling their stories ."
"So when I me@@ et re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , I always ask them questions ."
Wh@@ o b@@ om@@ bed your house ?
Wh@@ o kill@@ ed your son ?
D@@ id the re@@ st of your family make it out ali@@ ve ?
How are you c@@ op@@ ing in your life in ex@@ ile ?
"But there &apos;s one question that always se@@ ems to me to be most re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing , and that is : What did you take ?"
"What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the b@@ om@@ b@@ s were ex@@ plod@@ ing in your to@@ wn , and the ar@@ med gan@@ gs were appro@@ ach@@ ing your house ?"
A S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee bo@@ y I know told me that he didn &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate when his life was in im@@ min@@ ent dan@@ ger .
"He took his high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a , and later he told me why ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I took my high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a because my life de@@ pen@@ ded on it . &quot; &quot; And he would risk his life to get that di@@ pl@@ om@@ a ."
"On his way to school , he would d@@ od@@ ge sni@@ per@@ s ."
"H@@ is clas@@ s@@ room sometimes sho@@ ok with the sound of b@@ om@@ b@@ s and sh@@ ell@@ ing , and his mother told me , &quot; &quot; E@@ very day , I would say to him every mor@@ ning , &apos; H@@ on@@ ey , ple@@ ase don &apos;t go to school . &apos; &quot; &quot; And when he in@@ sist@@ ed , she said , &quot; I would hu@@ g him as if it were for the last time . &quot;"
"But he said to his mother , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re all af@@ ra@@ id , but our det@@ er@@ min@@ ation to gradu@@ ate is stron@@ ger than our fe@@ ar . &quot; &quot; But one day , the family got ter@@ ri@@ ble news ."
"H@@ any &apos;s au@@ n@@ t , his un@@ cle and his cou@@ s@@ in were m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in their hom@@ es for re@@ f@@ using to leave their house ."
Th@@ e@@ ir th@@ ro@@ ats were sli@@ t .
It was time to fle@@ e .
"They left that day , right away , in their car , H@@ any h@@ id@@ den in the back because they were fac@@ ing ch@@ ec@@ k@@ poin@@ ts of men@@ ac@@ ing sol@@ di@@ ers ."
"And they would c@@ ross the bor@@ der into Le@@ ban@@ on , where they would find pe@@ ace ."
But they would beg@@ in a life of gru@@ el@@ ing har@@ d@@ ship and mon@@ ot@@ ony .
"They had no cho@@ ice but to build a sh@@ ack on the side of a mu@@ d@@ dy fiel@@ d , and this is H@@ any &apos;s bro@@ ther A@@ sh@@ ra@@ f , who pla@@ ys outside ."
"And that day , they jo@@ ined the bi@@ gg@@ est population of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es in the world , in a country , Le@@ ban@@ on , that is tiny ."
"It only has four million c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens , and there are one million S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es living there ."
"There &apos;s not a to@@ wn , a city or a v@@ ill@@ age that is not ho@@ st to S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
This is gener@@ os@@ ity and hum@@ an@@ ity that is rem@@ ar@@ ka@@ ble .
"Th@@ in@@ k about it this way , pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately ."
"It would be as if the entire population of Ger@@ many , 80 million people , would fle@@ e to the United States in just three years ."
"H@@ al@@ f of the entire population of S@@ y@@ ri@@ a is now u@@ pro@@ ot@@ ed , most of them inside the country ."
S@@ i@@ x and a half million people have fl@@ ed for their lives .
"O@@ ver and well over three million people have c@@ ros@@ sed the bor@@ ders and have found san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing countries , and only a small pro@@ por@@ tion , as you see , have mo@@ ved on to Euro@@ pe ."
What I find most wor@@ ry@@ ing is that half of all S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es are children .
I took this picture of this little girl .
It was just two hours after she had ar@@ ri@@ ved after a long tre@@ k from S@@ y@@ ri@@ a into J@@ or@@ d@@ an .
And most t@@ rou@@ bl@@ ing of all is that only 20 percent of S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee children are in school in Le@@ ban@@ on .
"And yet , S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee children , all re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives ."
Why ? Because it allo@@ ws them to think of their future rather than the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are of their past .
It allo@@ ws them to think of hope rather than h@@ at@@ red .
"I &apos;m rem@@ in@@ ded of a rec@@ ent vi@@ sit I took to a S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee cam@@ p in nor@@ ther@@ n I@@ ra@@ q , and I met this girl , and I thought , &quot; &quot; She &apos;s beautiful , &quot; &quot; and I went up to her and asked her , &quot; C@@ an I take your picture ? &quot;"
"And she said yes , but she re@@ f@@ used to sm@@ ile ."
"I think she couldn &apos;t , because I think she must realiz@@ e that she re@@ pres@@ ents a lost gener@@ ation of S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee children , a gener@@ ation is@@ ol@@ ated and f@@ ru@@ strat@@ ed ."
"And yet , look at what they fl@@ ed : ut@@ ter dest@@ ru@@ ction , buil@@ din@@ gs , industri@@ es , scho@@ ols , ro@@ ads , hom@@ es ."
H@@ any &apos;s home was also dest@@ ro@@ yed .
"This will need to be re@@ built by ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ts , by engine@@ ers , by electri@@ ci@@ ans ."
C@@ om@@ m@@ unities will need teach@@ ers and la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and polit@@ ici@@ ans interest@@ ed in re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation and not re@@ ven@@ ge .
"S@@ hou@@ ldn &apos;t this be re@@ built by the people with the lar@@ g@@ est sta@@ ke , the soci@@ et@@ ies in ex@@ ile , the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ?"
Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es have a lot of time to pre@@ p@@ are for their re@@ turn .
You might imagine that being a re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee is just a tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry state .
Well far from it .
"W@@ ith war@@ s going on and on , the aver@@ age time a re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee will spend in ex@@ ile is 1@@ 7 years ."
"H@@ any was into his second year in lim@@ bo when I went to vi@@ sit him rec@@ ently , and we con@@ duc@@ ted our entire con@@ vers@@ ation in En@@ gli@@ sh , which he conf@@ ess@@ ed to me he learned from read@@ ing all of D@@ an B@@ ro@@ wn &apos;s nov@@ els and from list@@ ening to American ra@@ p ."
We also sp@@ ent some ni@@ ce mo@@ ments of l@@ aughter and fu@@ n with his bel@@ ov@@ ed bro@@ ther A@@ sh@@ ra@@ f .
But I &apos;ll never for@@ get what he told me when we en@@ ded our con@@ vers@@ ation that day .
"He said to me , &quot; If I am not a stud@@ ent , I am nothing . &quot;"
H@@ any is one of 50 million people u@@ pro@@ ot@@ ed in this world today .
N@@ ever since Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I have so many people been for@@ ci@@ bly dis@@ plac@@ ed .
"So while we &apos;re making s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing progres@@ s in human health , in technology , in education and design , we are doing dan@@ ger@@ ously little to help the vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s and we are doing far too little to stop and prev@@ ent the war@@ s that are dri@@ ving them from their hom@@ es ."
And there are more and more vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s .
"E@@ very day , on aver@@ age , by the end of this day , 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people will be for@@ ci@@ bly dis@@ plac@@ ed from their hom@@ es — 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people ."
They fle@@ e across bor@@ ders like this one .
"We cap@@ tu@@ red this on the S@@ y@@ ri@@ an bor@@ der to J@@ or@@ d@@ an , and this is a ty@@ p@@ ical day ."
"O@@ r they fle@@ e on un@@ se@@ a@@ wor@@ thy and over@@ c@@ ro@@ w@@ ded bo@@ ats , ris@@ king their lives in this case just to re@@ ach sa@@ f@@ ety in Euro@@ pe ."
"This S@@ y@@ ri@@ an young man survi@@ ved one of these bo@@ ats that cap@@ si@@ z@@ ed — most of the people dro@@ w@@ ned — and he told us , &quot; &quot; S@@ y@@ ri@@ ans are just looking for a qui@@ et place where no@@ body h@@ ur@@ ts you , where no@@ body hum@@ ili@@ ates you , and where no@@ body kill@@ s you . &quot; &quot; Well , I think that should be the min@@ im@@ um ."
"H@@ ow about a place of heal@@ ing , of learning , and even opport@@ unity ?"
"A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans and Euro@@ pe@@ ans have the im@@ pres@@ sion that pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ally huge num@@ bers of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es are coming to their country , but the reality is that 8@@ 6 percent , the v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , are living in the develop@@ ing world , in countries stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with their own in@@ se@@ cur@@ ity , with their own issu@@ es of hel@@ ping their own popul@@ ations and pover@@ ty ."
So we@@ al@@ thy countries in the world should recogniz@@ e the hum@@ an@@ ity and the gener@@ os@@ ity of the countries that are ho@@ st@@ ing so many re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
And all countries should make sure that no one fle@@ eing war and per@@ se@@ cu@@ tion ar@@ ri@@ ves at a clo@@ sed bor@@ der .
( Applause ) Thank you .
But there is something more that we can do than just simply hel@@ ping re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es survi@@ ve .
We can help them th@@ ri@@ ve .
We should think of re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee cam@@ ps and comm@@ unities as more than just tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry population c@@ en@@ ters where people langu@@ ish wa@@ iting for the war to end .
"R@@ a@@ ther , as c@@ en@@ ters of exc@@ ell@@ ence , where re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es can tri@@ um@@ ph over their tra@@ um@@ a and tra@@ in for the day that they can go home as ag@@ ents of pos@@ itive change and social trans@@ form@@ ation ."
"It makes so much sense , but I &apos;m rem@@ in@@ ded of the ter@@ ri@@ ble war in S@@ om@@ ali@@ a that has been ra@@ ging on for 2@@ 2 years ."
And imagine living in this cam@@ p .
I vis@@ ited this cam@@ p .
"It &apos;s in D@@ j@@ i@@ b@@ ou@@ ti , ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing S@@ om@@ ali@@ a , and it was so rem@@ ot@@ e that we had to take a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter to f@@ ly there ."
It was du@@ st@@ y and it was ter@@ ri@@ bly ho@@ t .
"And we went to vi@@ sit a school and started talking to the children , and then I saw this girl across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own d@@ aughter , and I went up and tal@@ ked to her ."
"And I asked her the questions that grow@@ n-@@ u@@ ps ask kids , like , &quot; &quot; What is your fav@@ or@@ ite sub@@ ject ? &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot; &quot; And this is when her face turned bl@@ ank , and she said to me , &quot; &quot; I have no future ."
"My scho@@ ol@@ ing days are over . &quot; &quot; And I thought , there must be some mis@@ under@@ standing , so I turned to my colle@@ ag@@ ue and she con@@ fi@@ r@@ med to me there is no fun@@ ding for secon@@ d@@ ary education in this cam@@ p ."
"And how I wi@@ shed at that moment that I could say to her , &quot; We will build you a school . &quot;"
"And I also thought , what a w@@ ast@@ e ."
She should be and she is the future of S@@ om@@ ali@@ a .
"A bo@@ y na@@ med J@@ ac@@ ob A@@ tem had a different chan@@ ce , but not before he experi@@ en@@ ced ter@@ ri@@ bly tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y ."
"He wat@@ ched — this is in S@@ ud@@ an — as his v@@ ill@@ age — he was only se@@ ven years old — bur@@ ned to the ground , and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family were kill@@ ed that day ."
"O@@ n@@ ly his cou@@ s@@ in survi@@ ved , and the two of them wal@@ ked for se@@ ven months — this is bo@@ ys like him — chas@@ ed and pur@@ su@@ ed by w@@ il@@ d animals and ar@@ med gan@@ gs , and they finally made it to re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee cam@@ ps where they found sa@@ f@@ ety , and he would spend the next se@@ ven years in K@@ en@@ y@@ a in a re@@ fu@@ g@@ ee cam@@ p ."
"But his life changed when he got the chan@@ ce to be res@@ et@@ t@@ led to the United States , and he found love in a fo@@ ster family and he was able to go to school , and he wanted me to share with you this pro@@ u@@ d moment when he gradu@@ ated from univers@@ ity ."
"( Applause ) I spo@@ ke to him on S@@ k@@ y@@ pe the other day , and he was in his new univers@@ ity in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da pur@@ su@@ ing his P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . in public health , and he pro@@ ud@@ ly told me how he was able to ra@@ ise enough fun@@ ds from the American public to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh a health cl@@ in@@ ic back in his v@@ ill@@ age back home ."
So I want to take you back to H@@ any .
"When I told him I was going to have the chan@@ ce to speak to you here on the TED stage , he allo@@ wed me to read you a po@@ em that he s@@ ent in an em@@ a@@ il to me ."
"He w@@ ro@@ te : &quot; &quot; I mis@@ s myself , my friends , times of read@@ ing nov@@ els or writ@@ ing po@@ ems , bir@@ ds and te@@ a in the mor@@ ning ."
"My room , my bo@@ oks , myself , and everything that was making me sm@@ ile ."
"O@@ h , o@@ h , I had so many dre@@ am@@ s that were about to be realized . &quot; &quot; So here is my point : N@@ ot invest@@ ing in re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es is a huge mis@@ sed opport@@ unity ."
"L@@ e@@ ave them ab@@ an@@ don@@ ed , and they risk ex@@ plo@@ it@@ ation and ab@@ use , and leave them un@@ sk@@ ill@@ ed and u@@ ne@@ duc@@ ated , and del@@ ay by years the re@@ turn to pe@@ ace and pros@@ per@@ ity in their countries ."
I believe how we tre@@ at the u@@ pro@@ ot@@ ed will sh@@ ape the future of our world .
"The vi@@ c@@ tim@@ s of war can h@@ old the ke@@ ys to la@@ st@@ ing pe@@ ace , and it &apos;s the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es who can stop the cy@@ cle of viol@@ ence ."
H@@ any is at a ti@@ pp@@ ing point .
"We would love to help him go to univers@@ ity and to become an engine@@ er , but our fun@@ ds are pri@@ or@@ it@@ iz@@ ed for the ba@@ si@@ cs in life : t@@ ents and bl@@ an@@ k@@ ets and mat@@ tre@@ s@@ ses and kit@@ ch@@ en s@@ ets , food r@@ ations and a bit of medi@@ c@@ ine ."
Uni@@ vers@@ ity is a lu@@ x@@ ury .
"But leave him to langu@@ ish in this mu@@ d@@ dy fiel@@ d , and he will become a mem@@ ber of a lost gener@@ ation ."
"H@@ any &apos;s story is a tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y , but it doesn &apos;t have to end that way ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"B@@ el@@ i@@ eve me or not , I come off@@ ering a solution to a very important part of this lar@@ ger problem , with the re@@ qu@@ is@@ ite foc@@ us on clim@@ ate ."
"And the solution I off@@ er is to the bi@@ gg@@ est cul@@ pri@@ t in this mas@@ sive mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of the ear@@ th by hum@@ an@@ kind , and the resul@@ ting de@@ cl@@ ine of the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere ."
"That cul@@ pri@@ t is business and indu@@ stry , which happens to be where I have sp@@ ent the last 5@@ 2 years since my gradu@@ ation from G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a T@@ ec@@ h in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"As an industri@@ al engine@@ er , c@@ um as@@ pi@@ r@@ ing and then succ@@ ess@@ ful ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur ."
"A@@ f@@ ter f@@ oun@@ ding my company , Inter@@ face , from sc@@ rat@@ ch in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , 3@@ 6 years ago , to produ@@ ce car@@ p@@ et t@@ il@@ es in America for the business and instit@@ ution mark@@ ets , and she@@ ph@@ er@@ ding it through star@@ t-@@ up and survi@@ val to pros@@ per@@ ity and global dom@@ in@@ ance in its fiel@@ d , I read P@@ au@@ l H@@ aw@@ k@@ en &apos;s book , &quot; The E@@ col@@ og@@ y of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce , &quot; the sum@@ mer of 199@@ 4 ."
"In his book , P@@ au@@ l ch@@ ar@@ ges business and indu@@ stry as , one , the maj@@ or cul@@ pri@@ t in cau@@ sing the de@@ cl@@ ine of the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere , and , two , the only instit@@ ution that is large enough , and per@@ va@@ sive enough , and powerful enough , to really le@@ ad hum@@ an@@ kind out of this m@@ ess ."
And by the way he con@@ vi@@ cted me as a pl@@ under@@ er of the ear@@ th .
"And I then chall@@ eng@@ ed the people of Inter@@ face , my company , to le@@ ad our company and the entire industri@@ al world to su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability , which we de@@ fin@@ ed as ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally oper@@ ating our p@@ et@@ ro@@ le@@ um@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive company in such a way as to take from the ear@@ th only what can be ren@@ e@@ wed by the ear@@ th , nat@@ ur@@ ally and ra@@ pi@@ dly — not another f@@ res@@ h dro@@ p of oil — and to do no har@@ m to the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere ."
Ta@@ ke nothing : do no har@@ m .
"I simply said , &quot; &quot; If H@@ aw@@ k@@ en is right and business and indu@@ stry must le@@ ad , who will le@@ ad business and indu@@ stry ?"
"U@@ n@@ less somebody lea@@ ds , no@@ body will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a@@ x@@ i@@ om@@ atic . Why not us ?"
"And th@@ an@@ ks to the people of Inter@@ face , I have become a rec@@ over@@ ing pl@@ under@@ er ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a F@@ or@@ tu@@ ne M@@ ag@@ az@@ ine writ@@ er that some@@ day people like me would go to ja@@ il .
And that became the he@@ a@@ dl@@ ine of a F@@ or@@ tu@@ ne arti@@ cle .
They went on to descri@@ be me as America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O .
"F@@ rom pl@@ under@@ er to rec@@ over@@ ing pl@@ under@@ er , to America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O in five years — that , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , was a pretty sa@@ d com@@ men@@ t@@ ary on American C@@ E@@ O@@ s in 199@@ 9 ."
"A@@ sk@@ ed later in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an do@@ cu@@ men@@ t@@ ary , &quot; &quot; The C@@ or@@ por@@ ation , &quot; &quot; what I me@@ ant by the &quot; &quot; go to ja@@ il &quot; &quot; rem@@ ar@@ k , I off@@ er@@ ed that the@@ ft is a cri@@ me ."
And the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future would some@@ day be a cri@@ me .
"But I realized , for that to be true — for the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future to be a cri@@ me — there must be a clear , demon@@ stra@@ ble al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative to the tak@@ e-@@ mak@@ e-@@ w@@ ast@@ e industri@@ al system that so dom@@ in@@ ates our ci@@ viliz@@ ation , and is the maj@@ or cul@@ pri@@ t , ste@@ al@@ ing our children &apos;s future , by di@@ gg@@ ing up the ear@@ th and con@@ ver@@ ting it to produc@@ ts that quickly become w@@ ast@@ e in a lan@@ d@@ f@@ ill or an in@@ c@@ in@@ er@@ ator — in shor@@ t , di@@ gg@@ ing up the ear@@ th and con@@ ver@@ ting it to pol@@ lu@@ tion ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch and a w@@ ell@@ -@@ known environ@@ mental imp@@ act equ@@ ation , imp@@ act — a bad thing — is the produc@@ t of population , aff@@ lu@@ ence and technology ."
"That is , imp@@ act is gener@@ ated by people , what they con@@ su@@ me in their aff@@ lu@@ ence , and how it is produc@@ ed ."
"And though the equ@@ ation is lar@@ g@@ ely sub@@ jec@@ tive , you can perhaps qu@@ anti@@ fy people , and perhaps qu@@ anti@@ fy aff@@ lu@@ ence , but technology is ab@@ u@@ sive in too many ways to qu@@ anti@@ fy ."
So the equ@@ ation is conc@@ ep@@ tual .
S@@ t@@ ill it works to help us understand the problem .
"So we set out at Inter@@ face , in 199@@ 4 , to create an example : to trans@@ form the way we made car@@ p@@ et , a p@@ et@@ ro@@ le@@ um@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive produc@@ t for materi@@ als as well as energy , and to trans@@ form our tech@@ nologi@@ es so they d@@ im@@ in@@ ish@@ ed environ@@ mental imp@@ act , rather than mul@@ ti@@ pli@@ ed it ."
"P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch &apos;s environ@@ mental imp@@ act equ@@ ation : I is equ@@ al to P times A times T : population , aff@@ lu@@ ence and technology ."
I wanted Inter@@ face to re@@ write that equ@@ ation so that it read I equ@@ als P times A di@@ vid@@ ed by T@@ .
"Now , the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ call@@ y-@@ min@@ ded will see im@@ medi@@ ately that T in the nu@@ mer@@ ator incre@@ ases imp@@ act — a bad thing — but T in the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator de@@ cre@@ ases imp@@ act ."
"So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the nu@@ mer@@ ator — call it T@@ 1 — where it incre@@ ases imp@@ act , to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator — call it T@@ 2 — where it re@@ duc@@ es imp@@ act ?"
"I thought about the charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of first industri@@ al revol@@ ution , T@@ 1 , as we pra@@ cti@@ ced it at Inter@@ face , and it had the fol@@ lo@@ wing charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics ."
E@@ x@@ tra@@ ctive : taking ra@@ w materi@@ als from the ear@@ th .
"L@@ ine@@ ar : take , make , w@@ ast@@ e ."
Po@@ wer@@ ed by f@@ os@@ sil fu@@ el@@ -@@ der@@ i@@ ved energy .
W@@ ast@@ e@@ ful : ab@@ u@@ sive and foc@@ used on lab@@ or produc@@ tiv@@ ity .
M@@ ore car@@ p@@ et per man@@ -@@ h@@ our .
"Th@@ in@@ king it through , I realized that all those at@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ es must be changed to move T to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator ."
"In the new industri@@ al revol@@ ution extra@@ ctive must be re@@ plac@@ ed by ren@@ e@@ w@@ able ; lin@@ e@@ ar by cy@@ c@@ li@@ cal ; f@@ os@@ sil fu@@ el energy by ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy , su@@ n@@ light ; w@@ ast@@ e@@ ful by w@@ ast@@ e-@@ free ; and ab@@ u@@ sive by b@@ eni@@ g@@ n ; and lab@@ or produc@@ tiv@@ ity by resour@@ ce produc@@ tiv@@ ity ."
"And I reas@@ on@@ ed that if we could make those trans@@ form@@ ative changes , and get ri@@ d of T@@ 1 al@@ together , we could re@@ du@@ ce our imp@@ act to zer@@ o , inclu@@ ding our imp@@ act on the clim@@ ate ."
"And that became the Inter@@ face plan in 199@@ 5 , and has been the plan ever since ."
We have meas@@ u@@ red our progres@@ s very ri@@ goro@@ us@@ ly .
So I can tell you how far we have come in the en@@ su@@ ing 12 years .
Net gre@@ en@@ house g@@ as em@@ is@@ sions down 8@@ 2 percent in absol@@ ute ton@@ na@@ ge .
( Applause ) O@@ ver the same sp@@ an of time s@@ al@@ es have incre@@ as@@ ed by tw@@ o-@@ th@@ ir@@ ds and prof@@ its have d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed .
So an 8@@ 2 percent absol@@ ute re@@ duc@@ tion tran@@ sl@@ ates into a 9@@ 0 percent re@@ duc@@ tion in gre@@ en@@ house g@@ as in@@ ten@@ s@@ ity rel@@ ative to s@@ al@@ es .
This is the mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de of the re@@ duc@@ tion the entire global tech@@ no@@ sp@@ here must realiz@@ e by 20@@ 50 to av@@ o@@ id cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ic clim@@ ate dis@@ rup@@ tion — so the scientists are telling us .
"F@@ os@@ sil fu@@ el u@@ sage is down 60 percent per un@@ it of produc@@ tion , du@@ e to eff@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es in ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les ."
"The che@@ ap@@ est , most sec@@ ure bar@@ re@@ l of oil there is is the one not used through eff@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
W@@ ater u@@ sage is down 7@@ 5 percent in our wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de car@@ p@@ et t@@ ile business .
"D@@ own 40 percent in our bro@@ ad@@ lo@@ om car@@ p@@ et business , which we ac@@ qui@@ red in 199@@ 3 right here in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , C@@ ity of In@@ du@@ stry , where water is so pre@@ ci@@ ous ."
"R@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able or rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able materi@@ als are 25 percent of the tot@@ al , and gro@@ wing ra@@ pi@@ dly ."
"R@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy is 2@@ 7 percent of our tot@@ al , going for 100 percent ."
"We have di@@ ver@@ ted 1@@ 4@@ 8 million po@@ un@@ ds — that &apos;s 7@@ 4@@ ,000 t@@ ons — of used car@@ p@@ et from lan@@ d@@ f@@ ill@@ s , clo@@ sing the lo@@ op on material flo@@ ws through re@@ ver@@ se lo@@ gi@@ st@@ ics and post@@ -@@ con@@ su@@ mer rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing tech@@ nologi@@ es that did not ex@@ ist when we started 1@@ 4 years ago ."

We call it C@@ o@@ ol C@@ ar@@ p@@ et .
"And it has been a powerful mark@@ et@@ place differ@@ enti@@ ator , incre@@ as@@ ing s@@ al@@ es and prof@@ its ."
"Th@@ ree years ago we lau@@ n@@ ched car@@ p@@ et t@@ ile for the home , under the br@@ and F@@ lo@@ r , mis@@ sp@@ ell@@ ed F@@ -@@ L@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ R ."
You can point and c@@ li@@ ck today at F@@ l@@ or@@ .@@ c@@ om and have C@@ o@@ ol C@@ ar@@ p@@ et deli@@ ver@@ ed to your front do@@ or in five days .
"It is pra@@ cti@@ cal , and pretty too ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We rec@@ k@@ on that we are a bit over hal@@ f@@ way to our go@@ al : zer@@ o imp@@ act , zer@@ o fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t ."
"We &apos;ve set 20@@ 20 as our tar@@ get year for zer@@ o , for re@@ ach@@ ing the top , the sum@@ m@@ it of M@@ oun@@ t Su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability ."
We call this M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o .
And this is perhaps the most important fac@@ et : we have found M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o to be incredi@@ bly good for business .
"A better business model , a better way to bi@@ g@@ ger prof@@ its ."
Here is the business case for su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability .
"F@@ rom real life experience , co@@ sts are down , not up , re@@ fle@@ c@@ ting some 4@@ 00 million dollars of av@@ o@@ id@@ ed co@@ sts in pur@@ su@@ it of zer@@ o w@@ ast@@ e — the first face of M@@ oun@@ t Su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability ."
This has pa@@ id all the co@@ sts for the trans@@ form@@ ation of Inter@@ face .
"And this dis@@ p@@ els a my@@ th too , this f@@ al@@ se cho@@ ice between the environment and the economy ."
"O@@ ur produc@@ ts are the best they &apos;ve ever been , in@@ spi@@ red by design for su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability , an u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted w@@ ell@@ sp@@ r@@ ing of innov@@ ation ."
O@@ ur people are gal@@ v@@ an@@ iz@@ ed around this sha@@ red high@@ er pur@@ pose .
You can@@ not be@@ at it for at@@ tra@@ c@@ ting the best people and br@@ ing@@ ing them together .
And the go@@ od@@ will of the mark@@ et@@ place is ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing .
"No amount of ad@@ ver@@ t@@ is@@ ing , no cle@@ ver mark@@ et@@ ing cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , at any pri@@ ce , could have produc@@ ed or created this much go@@ od@@ will ."
"C@@ o@@ sts , produc@@ ts , people , mark@@ et@@ places — what else is there ?"
It is a better business model .
And here is our 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year recor@@ d of s@@ al@@ es and prof@@ its .
"There is a di@@ p there , from 200@@ 1 to 200@@ 3 : a di@@ p when our s@@ al@@ es , over a thre@@ e-@@ year period , were down 1@@ 7 percent ."
But the mark@@ et@@ place was down 3@@ 6 percent .
We liter@@ ally ga@@ ined market share .
We might not have survi@@ ved that rec@@ es@@ sion but for the adv@@ anta@@ ges of su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability .
"If every business were pur@@ su@@ ing Inter@@ face plan@@ s , would that sol@@ ve all our problems ?"
I don &apos;t think so .
"I re@@ ma@@ in t@@ rou@@ bl@@ ed by the re@@ vis@@ ed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch equ@@ ation , I equ@@ als P times A di@@ vid@@ ed by T@@ 2 ."
"That A is a cap@@ ital A , su@@ gg@@ est@@ ing that aff@@ lu@@ ence is an end in itself ."
But what if we re@@ fra@@ med E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch f@@ ur@@ ther ?
"And what if we made A a lo@@ wer@@ case &apos; a , &apos; su@@ gg@@ est@@ ing that it is a means to an end , and that end is happ@@ in@@ ess — more happ@@ in@@ ess with less stuff ."
"You know that would re@@ fra@@ me ci@@ viliz@@ ation itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of econo@@ m@@ ics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succ@@ e@@ ed@@ s us : the su@@ sta@@ in@@ able species , living on a fin@@ ite ear@@ th , e@@ th@@ ically , happ@@ ily and ec@@ olog@@ ically in bal@@ ance with nature and all her natural systems for a thou@@ s@@ and gener@@ ations , or 1@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations — that is to say , into the inde@@ fin@@ ite future ."
But does the ear@@ th have to wa@@ it for our ex@@ tin@@ ction as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
"A@@ t Inter@@ face we really in@@ t@@ end to bring this pro@@ tot@@ y@@ p@@ ical su@@ sta@@ in@@ able , zer@@ o-@@ fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t industri@@ al company fully into exist@@ ence by 20@@ 20 ."
"We can see our way now , clear to the top of that m@@ oun@@ tain ."
And now the chall@@ enge is in ex@@ ec@@ ution .
"And as my good friend and ad@@ vis@@ er A@@ mor@@ y L@@ ov@@ ins says , &quot; If something exist@@ s , it must be possible . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible ."
"If we , a p@@ et@@ ro@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive company can do it , any@@ body can ."

"H@@ aw@@ k@@ en ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ed business and indu@@ stry , le@@ ad@@ ing hum@@ an@@ kind away from the ab@@ ys@@ s because , with contin@@ u@@ ed un@@ ch@@ ec@@ ked de@@ cl@@ ine of the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere , a very de@@ ar person is at risk here — f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , an u@@ na@@ cc@@ ep@@ table risk ."
Wh@@ o is that person ?
N@@ ot you . N@@ ot I@@ .
But let me in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to the one who is most at risk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this m@@ oun@@ tain clim@@ b .
"On a T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ ning in Mar@@ ch of 199@@ 6 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opport@@ unity back then , br@@ ing@@ ing them along and often not kno@@ wing whether I was conne@@ c@@ ting ."
"But about five days later back in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , I rec@@ ei@@ ved an em@@ a@@ il from G@@ len@@ n Th@@ om@@ as , one of my people in the C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a me@@ et@@ ing ."
He was sen@@ ding me an orig@@ in@@ al po@@ em that he had com@@ posed after our T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ ning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most up@@ li@@ f@@ ting mo@@ ments of my life .
"Because it told me , by G@@ od , one person got it ."
"H@@ ere is what G@@ len@@ n w@@ ro@@ te . And here is that person , most at risk ."
"P@@ le@@ ase me@@ et &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ out a name , an un@@ seen face , and kno@@ wing not your time or place , T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , though yet un@@ born , I met you first last T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ n ."
A wi@@ se friend in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed us two .
"And through his sob@@ ering point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me ."
K@@ no@@ wing you has changed my thinking .
"For I never had an in@@ kl@@ ing that perhaps the things I do might some@@ day , some@@ how thre@@ at@@ en you ."
"T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , my d@@ aughter , son , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;ve just be@@ gu@@ n to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should ."
"B@@ eg@@ in , I will ."
"The way the cost of what I squ@@ an@@ der , what is lost , if ever I for@@ get that you will some@@ day come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ d &quot; &quot; has spo@@ k@@ en to me with one simple but pro@@ found mes@@ sage , which I pre@@ su@@ me to share with you ."
"We are , each and every one , a part of the we@@ b of life ."
