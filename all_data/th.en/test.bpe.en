"B@@ y the end of this year , there &apos;ll be ne@@ arly a billion people on this planet that acti@@ vely use social net@@ working sit@@ es ."
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to di@@ e .
"W@@ hi@@ le that might be a some@@ what mor@@ b@@ id thought , I think it has some really pro@@ found imp@@ li@@ ca@@ tions that are wor@@ th expl@@ or@@ ing ."
"What first got me thinking about this was a blo@@ g p@@ ost au@@ th@@ o@@ red ear@@ li@@ er this year by D@@ er@@ e@@ k K@@ . M@@ ill@@ er , who was a science and technology jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st who died of cancer ."
And what M@@ ill@@ er did was have his family and friends wr@@ ite a p@@ ost that went out sh@@ ort@@ ly after he died .
Here &apos;s what he wr@@ ote in star@@ ting that out .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m de@@ ad , and this is my last p@@ ost to my blo@@ g ."
"In adv@@ ance , I asked that once my body finally sh@@ ut down from the p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ments of my cancer , then my family and friends publi@@ sh this pre@@ par@@ ed messa@@ ge I wr@@ ote — the first part of the process of tur@@ ning this from an ac@@ tive we@@ b@@ s@@ ite to an arch@@ i@@ ve . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st , M@@ ill@@ er &apos;s arch@@ i@@ ve may have been better wr@@ it@@ ten and more care@@ fully cur@@ ated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are cre@@ ating an arch@@ i@@ ve that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any pre@@ vi@@ ous gener@@ ation ."
Con@@ si@@ der a few st@@ ats for a moment .
R@@ ight now there are 4@@ 8 hours of video being up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed to Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be every single min@@ u@@ te .
There are 200 million T@@ wee@@ ts being pos@@ ted every day .
And the a@@ verage F@@ ace@@ book us@@ er is cre@@ ating 9@@ 0 piec@@ es of cont@@ ent each mon@@ th .
"So when you think about your parents or your gr@@ and@@ parents , at best they may have created some phot@@ os or home vide@@ os , or a di@@ ary that lives in a box some@@ where ."
"But today we &apos;re all cre@@ ating this incredi@@ bly ri@@ ch di@@ g@@ ital arch@@ i@@ ve that &apos;s going to live in the cl@@ ou@@ d in@@ defin@@ it@@ ely , years after we &apos;re g@@ one ."
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredi@@ bly in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing opport@@ uni@@ ties for techno@@ logi@@ sts .
"Now to be cle@@ ar , I &apos;m a jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st and not a techno@@ logi@@ st , so what I &apos;d like to do bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly is pa@@ int a picture of what the pres@@ ent and the future are going to look like ."
Now we &apos;re already seeing some serv@@ ices that are design@@ ed to let us deci@@ de what happens to our on@@ line pro@@ fi@@ le and our social media ac@@ coun@@ ts after we di@@ e .
"One of them actually , f@@ it@@ t@@ ing@@ ly enough , found me when I ch@@ ec@@ ked into a d@@ el@@ i at a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in New York on f@@ our@@ squ@@ are ."
( R@@ ec@@ or@@ ding ) A@@ d@@ am O@@ st@@ row : H@@ ell@@ o .
D@@ e@@ ath : A@@ d@@ am ?
A@@ O : Y@@ eah .
"D@@ e@@ ath : D@@ e@@ ath can ca@@ t@@ ch you any@@ where , any@@ time , even at the O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ ic ."
A@@ O : Wh@@ o is this ?
D@@ e@@ ath : G@@ o to i@@ fi@@ di@@ e@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too l@@ ate .
"( Laughter ) A@@ d@@ am O@@ st@@ row : K@@ ind of cre@@ ep@@ y , right ?"
"So what that serv@@ ice does , quite simply , is let you create a messa@@ ge or a video that can be pos@@ ted to F@@ ace@@ book after you di@@ e ."
"A@@ no@@ ther serv@@ ice right now is called 1@@ ,000 M@@ em@@ or@@ ies ."
"And what this le@@ ts you do is create an on@@ line tri@@ bu@@ te to your lo@@ ved ones , comple@@ te with phot@@ os and vide@@ os and stories that they can p@@ ost after you di@@ e ."
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
"Now a lot of you are probably fami@@ li@@ ar with D@@ e@@ b R@@ o@@ y who , back in Mar@@ ch , de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated how he was able to anal@@ y@@ ze more than 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video ."
"I think as mach@@ ines &apos; ability to understand human language and process va@@ st amoun@@ ts of data contin@@ ues to im@@ pro@@ ve , it &apos;s going to become possible to anal@@ y@@ ze an entire life &apos;s wor@@ th of cont@@ ent — the T@@ wee@@ ts , the phot@@ os , the vide@@ os , the blo@@ g pos@@ ts — that we &apos;re produc@@ ing in such ma@@ ssi@@ ve numbers ."
"And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our di@@ g@@ ital pers@@ on@@ as to contin@@ ue to inter@@ act in the real world long after we &apos;re g@@ one th@@ an@@ ks to the va@@ st@@ ness of the amount of cont@@ ent we &apos;re cre@@ ating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all ."
Now we &apos;re already star@@ ting to see some exper@@ im@@ ents here .
"One serv@@ ice called My N@@ ext T@@ we@@ et anal@@ y@@ z@@ es your entire T@@ wit@@ ter stre@@ am , everything you &apos;ve pos@@ ted on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , to make some predic@@ tions as to what you might say next ."
"Well right now , as you can see , the resul@@ ts can be some@@ what com@@ i@@ cal ."
"You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our tech@@ ni@@ cal cap@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties im@@ pro@@ ve ."
"T@@ a@@ king it a ste@@ p f@@ ur@@ ther , M@@ I@@ T &apos;s media la@@ b is working on ro@@ bot@@ s that can inter@@ act more like humans ."
But what if those ro@@ bot@@ s were able to inter@@ act based on the uni@@ que char@@ acter@@ is@@ tics of a speci@@ fic person based on the hund@@ reds of thousands of piec@@ es of cont@@ ent that person produc@@ es in their li@@ fe@@ time ?
"F@@ in@@ ally , think back to this fa@@ mous sc@@ en@@ e from elec@@ tion night 200@@ 8 back in the United States , where C@@ N@@ N be@@ am@@ ed a live ho@@ lo@@ gra@@ m of hi@@ p h@@ op arti@@ st w@@ ill@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ am into their stu@@ di@@ o for an inter@@ view with An@@ der@@ son C@@ o@@ op@@ er ."
What if we were able to use that same typ@@ e of technology to be@@ am a re@@ pre@@ sen@@ tation of our lo@@ ved ones into our living ro@@ om@@ s — inter@@ ac@@ ting in a very li@@ fe@@ like way based on all the cont@@ ent they created while they were ali@@ ve ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re produc@@ ing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both exp@@ and exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally .
"Now in clos@@ ing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a defin@@ ition of life and everything that comes after it ."
Thank you very much .

People re@@ tur@@ ning to work after a care@@ er brea@@ k : I call them rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers .
"Th@@ ese are people who have taken care@@ er brea@@ ks for el@@ der care , for chil@@ d@@ care reas@@ ons , pur@@ su@@ ing a pers@@ onal inter@@ est or a pers@@ onal health issu@@ e ."
"C@@ l@@ os@@ ely re@@ l@@ ated are care@@ er tran@@ si@@ tion@@ ers of all kinds : ve@@ ter@@ ans , mil@@ it@@ ary sp@@ ous@@ es , re@@ ti@@ re@@ es coming out of re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment or re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ating exp@@ ats ."
Re@@ tur@@ ning to work after a care@@ er brea@@ k is hard because of a dis@@ con@@ n@@ ect between the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers and the rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers .
"E@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers can view h@@ ir@@ ing people with a ga@@ p on their re@@ su@@ me as a high@@ -@@ risk pro@@ pos@@ ition , and individu@@ als on care@@ er brea@@ k can have d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts about their ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties to rela@@ unch their care@@ ers , esp@@ eci@@ ally if they &apos;ve been out for a long time ."
This dis@@ con@@ n@@ ect is a problem that I &apos;m trying to help solve .
"Now , suc@@ cess@@ ful rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are every@@ where and in every field ."
This is S@@ am@@ i K@@ af@@ al@@ a .
He &apos;s a n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar physi@@ ci@@ st in the U@@ K who took a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year care@@ er brea@@ k to be home with his five children .
The S@@ ing@@ ap@@ ore pre@@ ss rec@@ ently wr@@ ote about n@@ ur@@ ses re@@ tur@@ ning to work after long care@@ er brea@@ ks .
"And spea@@ king of long care@@ er brea@@ ks , this is M@@ im@@ i K@@ a@@ h@@ n ."
"S@@ he &apos;s a social wor@@ ker in O@@ ran@@ ge C@@ oun@@ ty , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , who re@@ turned to work in a social serv@@ ices organ@@ ization after a 2@@ 5@@ -@@ year care@@ er brea@@ k ."
That &apos;s the lon@@ gest care@@ er brea@@ k that I &apos;m aw@@ are of .
S@@ u@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce S@@ and@@ r@@ a D@@ ay O &apos;@@ Con@@ n@@ or took a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year care@@ er brea@@ k early in her care@@ er .
"And this is T@@ r@@ acy S@@ h@@ ap@@ ir@@ o , who took a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ year care@@ er brea@@ k ."
T@@ r@@ acy ans@@ wer@@ ed a call for es@@ says by the T@@ o@@ day S@@ how from people who were trying to re@@ turn to work but having a difficult time of it .
"T@@ r@@ acy wr@@ ote in that she was a mo@@ m of five who lo@@ ved her time at home , but she had g@@ one through a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce and needed to re@@ turn to work , pl@@ us she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she lo@@ ved working ."
T@@ r@@ acy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we &apos;ve put in a good day in the job search .
"S@@ he was looking for a fin@@ ance or ac@@ coun@@ ting ro@@ le , and she had just spent the last n@@ ine months very di@@ li@@ g@@ ently re@@ sear@@ ching companies on@@ line and ap@@ pl@@ ying for j@@ ob@@ s with no resul@@ ts ."
"I met T@@ r@@ acy in J@@ un@@ e of 20@@ 11 , when the T@@ o@@ day S@@ how asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around ."
The first thing I told T@@ r@@ acy was she had to get out of the house .
I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her inter@@ est in re@@ tur@@ ning to work .
"I also told her , &quot; &quot; You are going to have a lot of conver@@ sa@@ tions that don &apos;t go any@@ where ."
"E@@ x@@ p@@ ect that , and don &apos;t be di@@ sc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged by it ."
"There will be a h@@ and@@ ful that ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely le@@ ad to a job opport@@ unity . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what happened with T@@ r@@ acy in a little bit , but I want to share with you a disco@@ very that I made when I was re@@ tur@@ ning to work after my own care@@ er brea@@ k of 11 years out of the ful@@ l@@ -@@ time wor@@ k@@ for@@ ce ."
"And that is , that people &apos;s view of you is f@@ ro@@ z@@ en in time ."
"What I mean by this is , when you start to get in tou@@ ch with people and you get back in tou@@ ch with those people from the past , the people with wh@@ om you worked or went to school , they are going to remember you as you were before your care@@ er brea@@ k ."
"And that &apos;s even if your sense of self has di@@ min@@ i@@ shed over time , as happens with so many of us the far@@ ther re@@ mo@@ ved we are from our prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal identi@@ ties ."
"So for example , you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this ."
"This is me , cra@@ z@@ y after a day of dri@@ ving around in my min@@ i@@ v@@ an ."
O@@ r here I am in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en .
"But those people from the past , they don &apos;t know about any of this ."
"They only remember you as you were , and it &apos;s a great con@@ fi@@ dence bo@@ ost to be back in tou@@ ch with these people and hear their en@@ th@@ usi@@ as@@ m about your inter@@ est in re@@ tur@@ ning to work ."
There &apos;s one more thing I remember vi@@ vi@@ d@@ ly from my own care@@ er brea@@ k .
And that was that I har@@ d@@ ly ke@@ pt up with the business news .
"M@@ y b@@ ack@@ ground is in fin@@ ance , and I har@@ d@@ ly ke@@ pt up with any news when I was home car@@ ing for my four young children ."
So I was af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;d go into an inter@@ view and start talking about a company that didn &apos;t ex@@ ist any@@ more .
So I had to re@@ sub@@ scri@@ be to the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ n@@ al and read it for a good six months co@@ ver to co@@ ver before I felt like I had a h@@ and@@ le on what was going on in the business world again .
"I believe rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are a ge@@ m of the wor@@ k@@ for@@ ce , and here &apos;s why ."
"Th@@ ink about our life st@@ age : for those of us who took care@@ er brea@@ ks for chil@@ d@@ care reas@@ ons , we have fe@@ wer or no mat@@ er@@ n@@ ity lea@@ ves ."
We did that already .
We have fe@@ wer sp@@ ous@@ al or par@@ t@@ ner job re@@ lo@@ ca@@ tions .
We &apos;re in a more se@@ t@@ t@@ led time of life .
We have great work experience .
We have a more mat@@ ure per@@ spec@@ tive .
We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er &apos;s exp@@ en@@ se .
"P@@ l@@ us we have an energy , an en@@ th@@ usi@@ as@@ m about re@@ tur@@ ning to work pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly because we &apos;ve been away from it for a while ."
"O@@ n the f@@ li@@ p side , I speak with emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers , and here are two con@@ cer@@ ns that emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers have about h@@ ir@@ ing rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers ."
"The first one is , emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers are wor@@ ri@@ ed that rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are techno@@ lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ."
"Now , I can tell you , having been techno@@ lo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally ob@@ so@@ le@@ te myself at one point , that it &apos;s a te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary condi@@ tion ."
I had done my fin@@ anci@@ al anal@@ y@@ s@@ is so long ago that I used L@@ ot@@ us 1@@ -@@ 2@@ -@@ 3 .
"I don &apos;t know if any@@ one can even remember back that far , but I had to re@@ learn it on E@@ x@@ ce@@ l ."
It actually wasn &apos;t that hard . A lot of the comm@@ ands are the same .
"I found P@@ o@@ wer@@ P@@ o@@ int much more challen@@ ging , but now I use P@@ o@@ wer@@ P@@ o@@ int all the time ."
I tell rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers that emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers exp@@ ect them to come to the table with a working knowle@@ dge of ba@@ si@@ c off@@ ice man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
"And if they &apos;re not up to spe@@ ed , then it &apos;s their respon@@ si@@ bility to get there ."
And they do .
The second are@@ a of con@@ cer@@ n that emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers have about rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers is they &apos;re wor@@ ri@@ ed that rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers don &apos;t know what they want to do .
I tell rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interest@@ s and sk@@ ill@@ s have changed or have not changed while they have been on care@@ er brea@@ k .
That &apos;s not the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er &apos;s job .
It &apos;s the rela@@ un@@ ch@@ er &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility to de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate to the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er where they can ad@@ d the most val@@ ue .
B@@ ack in 20@@ 10 I started not@@ ic@@ ing something .
"I had been trac@@ king re@@ turn to work progra@@ ms since 200@@ 8 , and in 20@@ 10 , I started not@@ ic@@ ing the use of a sh@@ ort@@ -@@ ter@@ m pa@@ id work opport@@ unity , whether it was called an inter@@ n@@ ship or not , but an inter@@ n@@ shi@@ p@@ -@@ like experience , as a way for prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als to re@@ turn to work ."
I saw G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s and S@@ ar@@ a L@@ e@@ e start cor@@ por@@ ate re@@ en@@ try inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ ms .
"I saw a re@@ tur@@ ning engine@@ er , a non@@ tra@@ di@@ tional re@@ en@@ try can@@ di@@ d@@ ate , app@@ ly for an en@@ tr@@ y-@@ level inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ m in the mil@@ it@@ ary , and then get a per@@ man@@ ent job af@@ ter@@ ward ."
I saw two univer@@ si@@ ties in@@ te@@ gr@@ ate inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps into mi@@ d-@@ care@@ er ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive education progra@@ ms .
"So I wr@@ ote a re@@ p@@ ort about what I was seeing , and it became this ar@@ tic@@ le for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ iness Re@@ view called &quot; &quot; The 4@@ 0@@ -@@ Y@@ ear@@ -@@ O@@ ld Inter@@ n . &quot; &quot; I have to th@@ ank the ed@@ it@@ ors there for that ti@@ tle , and also for this ar@@ t@@ work where you can see the 4@@ 0@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old inter@@ n in the mi@@ d@@ st of all the colle@@ ge inter@@ ns ."
"And then , cour@@ t@@ es@@ y of F@@ o@@ x B@@ us@@ iness N@@ e@@ ws , they called the con@@ cept &quot; &quot; The 5@@ 0@@ -@@ Y@@ ear@@ -@@ O@@ ld Inter@@ n . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So five of the big@@ gest fin@@ anci@@ al serv@@ ices companies have re@@ en@@ try inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ ms for re@@ tur@@ ning fin@@ ance prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als ."
"And at this point , hund@@ reds of people have par@@ tici@@ p@@ ated ."
"Th@@ ese inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps are pa@@ id , and the people who move on to per@@ man@@ ent ro@@ les are comm@@ anding com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies ."
"And now , seven of the big@@ gest engine@@ ering companies are p@@ il@@ ot@@ ing re@@ en@@ try inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ ms for re@@ tur@@ ning engine@@ ers as part of an ini@@ ti@@ ative with the S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety of W@@ om@@ en En@@ gin@@ e@@ ers ."
"Now , why are companies em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing the re@@ en@@ try inter@@ n@@ ship ?"
"Because the inter@@ n@@ ship allo@@ ws the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er to ba@@ se their h@@ ir@@ ing deci@@ sion on an ac@@ tual work sa@@ mple instead of a ser@@ ies of inter@@ vi@@ e@@ ws , and the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er does not have to make that per@@ man@@ ent h@@ ir@@ ing deci@@ sion until the inter@@ n@@ ship per@@ i@@ od is over ."
"This te@@ sting out per@@ i@@ od re@@ mo@@ ves the per@@ cei@@ ved risk that some man@@ ag@@ ers att@@ ach to h@@ ir@@ ing rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers , and they are at@@ trac@@ ting exc@@ ell@@ ent can@@ di@@ d@@ ates who are tur@@ ning into great hi@@ res ."
Th@@ ink about how far we have come .
"@@ Be@@ fore this , most emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers were not interest@@ ed in eng@@ ag@@ ing with rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers at all ."
"But now , not only are progra@@ ms being develop@@ ed speci@@ fic@@ ally with rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers in mind , but you can &apos;t even app@@ ly for these progra@@ ms un@@ less you have a ga@@ p on your r@@ é@@ su@@ m@@ é ."
"This is the mar@@ k of real change , of true in@@ stitu@@ tional shi@@ ft , because if we can solve this problem for rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers , we can solve it for other care@@ er tran@@ si@@ tion@@ ers too ."
"In fact , an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er just told me that their ve@@ ter@@ ans re@@ turn to work progra@@ m is based on their re@@ en@@ try inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ m ."
And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a re@@ ti@@ ree inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ m .
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent p@@ ool , same con@@ cept ."
So let me tell you what happened with T@@ r@@ acy S@@ h@@ ap@@ ir@@ o .
Re@@ member that she had to tell everyone she knew about her inter@@ est in re@@ tur@@ ning to work .
"Well , one cri@@ tical conver@@ sa@@ tion with another par@@ ent in her community led to a job off@@ er for T@@ r@@ acy , and it was an ac@@ coun@@ ting job in a fin@@ ance de@@ par@@ t@@ ment ."
But it was a te@@ m@@ p job .
"The company told her there was a pos@@ si@@ bility it could turn into something more , but no gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es ."
This was in the f@@ all of 20@@ 11 .
"T@@ r@@ acy lo@@ ved this company , and she lo@@ ved the people and the off@@ ice was less than 10 minutes from her house ."
"So even though she had a second job off@@ er at another company for a per@@ man@@ ent ful@@ l@@ -@@ time ro@@ le , she decided to take her chan@@ ces with this inter@@ n@@ ship and hope for the best ."
"Well , she en@@ ded up blo@@ wing away all of their exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions , and the company not only made her a per@@ man@@ ent off@@ er at the begin@@ ning of 20@@ 12 , but they made it even more interesting and challen@@ ging , because they knew what T@@ r@@ acy could h@@ and@@ le ."
"F@@ ast for@@ ward to 20@@ 15 , T@@ r@@ acy &apos;s been pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ed ."
They &apos;ve pa@@ id for her to get her M@@ B@@ A at night .
She &apos;s even hi@@ red another rela@@ un@@ ch@@ er to work for her .
"T@@ r@@ acy &apos;s te@@ m@@ p job was a tr@@ y@@ out , just like an inter@@ n@@ ship , and it en@@ ded up being a w@@ in for both T@@ r@@ acy and her emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er ."
"Now , my go@@ al is to bring the re@@ en@@ try inter@@ n@@ ship con@@ cept to more and more emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers ."
"But in the me@@ an@@ time , if you are re@@ tur@@ ning to work after a care@@ er brea@@ k , don &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to su@@ g@@ gest an inter@@ n@@ ship or an inter@@ n@@ shi@@ p@@ -@@ like ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment to an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er that does not have a forma@@ l re@@ en@@ try inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ m ."
"B@@ e their first suc@@ cess story , and you can be the example for more rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers to come ."
Thank you .

It was an af@@ ter@@ no@@ on in the f@@ all of 200@@ 5 .
I was working at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U as the organ@@ ization &apos;s science ad@@ vi@@ s@@ or .
"I really , really lo@@ ved my job , but I was having one of those days where I was feel@@ ing just a little bit di@@ sc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged ."
So I w@@ and@@ ered down the h@@ all@@ way to my colle@@ ag@@ ue Ch@@ r@@ is H@@ ans@@ en &apos;s off@@ ice .
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is had been at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U for more than 30 years , so he had de@@ ep in@@ stitu@@ tional knowle@@ dge and in@@ si@@ ghts ."
I expla@@ ined to Ch@@ r@@ is that I was feel@@ ing a little bit st@@ uc@@ k .
I had been inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ating a number of issu@@ es at the inter@@ sec@@ tion of science and ci@@ vi@@ l li@@ ber@@ ties — su@@ per interesting .
"But I wanted the A@@ C@@ L@@ U to eng@@ age these issu@@ es in a much big@@ ger way , in a way that could really make a difference ."
"So Ch@@ r@@ is c@@ ut right to the cha@@ se , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the issu@@ es you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;"
"@@ &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s gen@@ e@@ tic di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation , and re@@ produc@@ tive techno@@ logi@@ es , and bi@@ ob@@ an@@ king , and ..@@ ."
"@@ o@@ h , there &apos;s this really c@@ ool issu@@ e , fun@@ c@@ tional M@@ R@@ I and using it for li@@ e de@@ t@@ ection , and ..@@ ."
"@@ o@@ h , and of course , there &apos;s gen@@ e pat@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ents ? &quot;"
"@@ &quot; Y@@ es , you know , pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; No !
You &apos;re telling me that the U@@ S government has been issu@@ ing pat@@ ents on part of the human body ?
That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my off@@ ice and s@@ ent Ch@@ r@@ is three arti@@ cl@@ es .
"And 20 minutes later , he came bur@@ sting in my off@@ ice ."
&quot; O@@ h my go@@ d ! You &apos;re right ! Wh@@ o can we su@@ e ? &quot;
"( Laughter ) Now Ch@@ r@@ is is a really bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant la@@ w@@ y@@ er , but he knew almost nothing about pat@@ ent la@@ w and cer@@ tain@@ ly nothing about gen@@ e@@ tics ."
"I knew something about gen@@ e@@ tics , but I wasn &apos;t even a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , let alone a pat@@ ent la@@ w@@ y@@ er ."
So c@@ lear@@ ly we had a lot to learn before we could fi@@ le a la@@ w@@ su@@ it .
"F@@ ir@@ st , we needed to understand exactly what was pat@@ en@@ ted when someone pat@@ en@@ ted a gen@@ e ."
"@@ G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ents t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally con@@ tain do@@ z@@ ens of cla@@ i@@ ms , but the most contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al of these are to so@@ -@@ called &quot; &quot; is@@ ol@@ ated DNA &quot; &quot; — na@@ me@@ ly , a piece of DNA that has been re@@ mo@@ ved from a cell ."
"@@ G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ent pro@@ p@@ on@@ ents say , &quot; &quot; S@@ e@@ e ? We didn &apos;t pat@@ ent the gen@@ e in your body , we pat@@ en@@ ted an is@@ ol@@ ated gen@@ e . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s true , but the problem is that any use of the gen@@ e requ@@ i@@ res that it be is@@ ol@@ ated ."
"And the pat@@ ents wer@@ en &apos;t just to a particular gen@@ e that they is@@ ol@@ ated , but on every possible ver@@ sion of that gen@@ e ."
So what does that mean ?
"That means that you can &apos;t give your gen@@ e to your doc@@ tor and ask him or her to look at it , say , to see if it has any mu@@ ta@@ tions , without per@@ mis@@ sion of the pat@@ ent hol@@ der ."
It also means that the pat@@ ent hol@@ der has the right to stop any@@ one from using that gen@@ e in research or cl@@ ini@@ cal te@@ sting .
"A@@ l@@ lo@@ wing pat@@ ent hol@@ ders , often pri@@ v@@ ate companies , to lo@@ ck up stre@@ t@@ ch@@ es of the human gen@@ ome was har@@ m@@ ing patients ."
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il , a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old with long Q@@ T sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , a ser@@ i@@ ous heart condi@@ tion that , if left un@@ tre@@ ated , can resul@@ t in su@@ dd@@ en de@@ ath ."
The company that ob@@ ta@@ ined a pat@@ ent on two gen@@ es as@@ soci@@ ated with this condi@@ tion develop@@ ed a test to di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome .
But then they went ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt and they never off@@ ered it .
"So another la@@ b tried to off@@ er the test , but the company that hel@@ d the pat@@ ents thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to su@@ e the la@@ b for pat@@ ent inf@@ r@@ in@@ ge@@ ment ."
"So as a resul@@ t , for 2 years , no test was a@@ va@@ il@@ able ."
"D@@ uring that time , A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il died of un@@ di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ed long Q@@ T ."
G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ents c@@ lear@@ ly were a problem and were har@@ m@@ ing patients .
But was there a way we could challenge them ?
"T@@ ur@@ ns out that the S@@ u@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t has made cle@@ ar through a long line of ca@@ ses , that certain things are not pat@@ ent e@@ li@@ gi@@ ble ."
"You can &apos;t pat@@ ent produc@@ ts of nature — the air , the water , min@@ er@@ als , el@@ em@@ ents of the per@@ i@@ o@@ di@@ c table ."
"And you can &apos;t pat@@ ent la@@ ws of nature — the la@@ w of gra@@ vity , E = m@@ c@@ 2 ."
These things are just too fundam@@ ental and must re@@ ma@@ in free to all and re@@ ser@@ ved ex@@ cl@@ usi@@ vely to n@@ one .
"It se@@ em@@ ed to us that DNA , the most fundam@@ ental structure of life , that co@@ des for the produc@@ tion of all of our prot@@ e@@ ins , is both a produc@@ t of nature and a la@@ w of nature , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of whether it &apos;s in our bo@@ dies or sit@@ ting in the bot@@ to@@ m of a test tu@@ be ."
"As we d@@ el@@ ved into this issu@@ e , we tra@@ vel@@ ed all over the country to speak with many different exper@@ ts — scientists , medi@@ cal prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , pat@@ ent la@@ w@@ y@@ ers ."
"M@@ ost of them ag@@ re@@ ed that we were right as a matter of poli@@ cy , and , at least in the@@ ory , as a matter of la@@ w ."
All of them thought our chan@@ ces of win@@ ning a gen@@ e-@@ pat@@ ent challenge were about z@@ er@@ o .
Why is that ?
"Well , the pat@@ ent off@@ ice had been issu@@ ing these pat@@ ents for more than 20 years ."
There were liter@@ ally thousands of pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es .
"The pat@@ ent b@@ ar was de@@ ep@@ ly en@@ tr@@ en@@ ched in the st@@ at@@ us qu@@ o , the bi@@ ot@@ ec@@ h indu@@ stry had gro@@ wn up around this pr@@ acti@@ ce , and le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation to b@@ an gen@@ e pat@@ ents had been int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed year after year in Con@@ gre@@ ss , and had g@@ one ab@@ solu@@ tely no@@ where ."
So the bot@@ to@@ m line : cour@@ ts just wer@@ en &apos;t going to be w@@ ill@@ ing to over@@ turn these pat@@ ents .
"Now , ne@@ i@@ ther Ch@@ r@@ is n@@ or I were the typ@@ e to sh@@ y away from a challenge , and hear@@ ing , &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; se@@ em@@ ed all the more reason to take on this fi@@ ght ."
So we set out to build our case .
"Now , pat@@ ent ca@@ ses t@@ end to be : C@@ om@@ p@@ any A su@@ es C@@ om@@ p@@ any B over some really n@@ ar@@ row , ob@@ sc@@ ure tech@@ ni@@ cal issu@@ e ."
"We wer@@ en &apos;t really interest@@ ed in that kind of case , and we thought this case was much big@@ ger than that ."
"This was about scienti@@ fic f@@ ree@@ dom , medi@@ cal pro@@ gre@@ ss , the ri@@ ghts of patients ."
So we decided we were going to devel@@ op a case that was not like your t@@ y@@ pi@@ cal pat@@ ent case — more like a ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts case .
We set out to identi@@ f@@ y a gen@@ e-@@ pat@@ ent hol@@ der that was vi@@ g@@ or@@ ously en@@ for@@ c@@ ing its pat@@ ents and then to organ@@ ize a bro@@ ad co@@ ali@@ tion of pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff@@ s and exper@@ ts that could tell the cour@@ t about all the ways that these pat@@ ents were har@@ m@@ ing patients and inno@@ v@@ ation .
"We found the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ d@@ ate to su@@ e in M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad G@@ ene@@ tics , a company that &apos;s based in S@@ al@@ t L@@ a@@ ke C@@ ity , U@@ ta@@ h ."
"M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad hel@@ d pat@@ ents on two gen@@ es , the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 1 and the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 2 gen@@ es ."
W@@ om@@ en with certain mu@@ ta@@ tions along these gen@@ es are consi@@ der@@ ed to be at a sign@@ i@@ fic@@ antly incre@@ ased risk of develop@@ ing brea@@ st and o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad had used its pat@@ ents to ma@@ in@@ tain a comple@@ te mon@@ op@@ o@@ ly on B@@ R@@ C@@ A te@@ sting in the United States .
It had for@@ c@@ ed mul@@ ti@@ ple l@@ ab@@ s that were off@@ ering B@@ R@@ C@@ A te@@ sting to stop .
"It char@@ ged a lot of money for its test — over 3@@ ,000 dollars ."
It had st@@ opp@@ ed shar@@ ing its cl@@ ini@@ cal data with the inter@@ national scienti@@ fic community .
"And perhaps wor@@ st of all , for a per@@ i@@ od of se@@ ver@@ al years , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad re@@ f@@ used to up@@ d@@ ate its test to inclu@@ de ad@@ di@@ tional mu@@ ta@@ tions that had been identi@@ fied by a team of re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers in F@@ r@@ ance ."
"It has been es@@ tim@@ ated that during that per@@ i@@ od , for se@@ ver@@ al years , as many as 12 percent of women under@@ going te@@ sting re@@ cei@@ ved the wrong answer — a ne@@ g@@ ative test resul@@ t that should have been pos@@ i@@ tive ."
This is K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en Ma@@ x@@ i@@ an .
K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s si@@ ster E@@ i@@ le@@ en develop@@ ed brea@@ st cancer at age 40 and she was te@@ sted by M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
The test was ne@@ g@@ ative .
The family was reli@@ ev@@ ed .
"That me@@ ant that E@@ i@@ le@@ en &apos;s cancer most like@@ ly didn &apos;t run in the family , and that other mem@@ bers of her family didn &apos;t need to be te@@ sted ."
"But two years later , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en was di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ed with adv@@ an@@ ce@@ d-@@ st@@ age o@@ vari@@ an cancer ."
It turned out that K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s si@@ ster was am@@ ong the 12 percent who re@@ cei@@ ved a f@@ al@@ se@@ -@@ ne@@ g@@ ative test resul@@ t .
"H@@ ad E@@ i@@ le@@ en re@@ cei@@ ved the pro@@ per resul@@ t , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en would have then been te@@ sted , and her o@@ vari@@ an cancer could have been pre@@ ven@@ ted ."
"O@@ n@@ ce we se@@ t@@ t@@ led on M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad , we then had to form a co@@ ali@@ tion of pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff@@ s and exper@@ ts that could ill@@ um@@ in@@ ate these problems ."
"We en@@ ded up with 20 high@@ ly comm@@ it@@ ted pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff@@ s : gen@@ e@@ tic coun@@ sel@@ ors , gen@@ e@@ tici@@ sts who had re@@ cei@@ ved c@@ ea@@ se and desi@@ st le@@ t@@ ters , ad@@ vo@@ ca@@ cy organ@@ iz@@ ations , four maj@@ or scienti@@ fic organ@@ iz@@ ations that coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted more than 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 scientists and medi@@ cal prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als , and individu@@ al women who either couldn &apos;t aff@@ ord M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s test , or who wanted to ob@@ tain a second op@@ ini@@ on but could not , as a resul@@ t of the pat@@ ents ."
One of the maj@@ or challen@@ ges we had in pre@@ par@@ ing the case was fig@@ uring out how best to communi@@ cate the science .
"So in order to ar@@ gu@@ e that what M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did was not an inv@@ en@@ tion , and that is@@ ol@@ ated B@@ R@@ C@@ A gen@@ es were produc@@ ts of nature , we had to expla@@ in a couple of ba@@ si@@ c con@@ cep@@ ts , like : What &apos;s a gen@@ e ? What &apos;s DNA ?"
"@@ How is DNA is@@ ol@@ ated , and why isn &apos;t that an inv@@ en@@ tion ?"
"We spent hours and hours with our pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff@@ s and exper@@ ts , trying to come up with ways of expla@@ ining these con@@ cep@@ ts simply yet ac@@ cur@@ ately ."
"And we en@@ ded up re@@ l@@ ying hea@@ vi@@ ly on the use of me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors , like go@@ ld ."
So is@@ ol@@ ating DNA — it &apos;s like ex@@ trac@@ ting go@@ ld from a m@@ oun@@ tain or taking it out of a stre@@ am bed .
"You might be able to pat@@ ent the process for min@@ ing the go@@ ld , but you can &apos;t pat@@ ent the go@@ ld itself ."
"It might &apos;ve taken a lot of hard work and eff@@ ort to di@@ g the go@@ ld out of the m@@ oun@@ tain ; you still can &apos;t pat@@ ent it , it &apos;s still go@@ ld ."
"And the go@@ ld , once it &apos;s ex@@ trac@@ ted , can c@@ lear@@ ly be used for all sor@@ ts of things that it couldn &apos;t be used for when it was in the m@@ oun@@ tain ; you can make j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry out of it for example — still can &apos;t pat@@ ent the go@@ ld , it &apos;s still go@@ ld ."
"So now it &apos;s 200@@ 9 , and we &apos;re ready to fi@@ le our case ."
"We fil@@ ed in fe@@ der@@ al cour@@ t in the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n D@@ i@@ stri@@ c@@ t of New York , and the case was r@@ and@@ om@@ ly as@@ sign@@ ed to J@@ u@@ dge R@@ ob@@ er@@ t S@@ we@@ et ."
"In Mar@@ ch 20@@ 10 , J@@ u@@ dge S@@ we@@ et issu@@ ed his op@@ ini@@ on — 1@@ 5@@ 2 p@@ ages — and a comple@@ te v@@ ic@@ t@@ ory for our side ."
"In read@@ ing the op@@ ini@@ on , we could not get over how el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently he descri@@ bed the science in the case ."
"I mean , our bri@@ e@@ f — it was pretty good , but not this good ."
How did he devel@@ op such a de@@ ep underst@@ anding of this issu@@ e in such a sh@@ ort time ?
We just could not com@@ pre@@ h@@ end how this had happened .
"So it turned out , J@@ u@@ dge S@@ we@@ et &apos;s cl@@ er@@ k working for him at the time , was not just a la@@ w@@ y@@ er — he was a scienti@@ st ."
He was not just a scienti@@ st — he had a P@@ h@@ D in m@@ olec@@ ular bio@@ logy .
( Laughter ) What an incredi@@ ble st@@ ro@@ ke of l@@ uc@@ k !
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad then appe@@ al@@ ed to the U@@ S C@@ our@@ t of A@@ p@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ e@@ der@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it .
And here things got really interesting .
"F@@ ir@@ st , in a pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al moment of this case , the U@@ S government s@@ wit@@ ched si@@ des ."
So in the di@@ stri@@ c@@ t cour@@ t the government sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted a bri@@ e@@ f on M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s side .
"But now in direc@@ t op@@ pos@@ ition to its own pat@@ ent off@@ ice , the U@@ S government fil@@ es a bri@@ e@@ f that st@@ ates that is has re@@ consi@@ der@@ ed this issu@@ e in light of the di@@ stri@@ c@@ t cour@@ t &apos;s op@@ ini@@ on , and has con@@ clu@@ ded that is@@ ol@@ ated DNA is not pat@@ ent e@@ li@@ gi@@ ble ."
"This was a really big de@@ al , t@@ ot@@ ally u@@ nex@@ p@@ ected ."
"The C@@ our@@ t of A@@ p@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ e@@ der@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it hear@@ s all pat@@ ent ca@@ ses , and it has a re@@ pu@@ tation for being very , very pro@@ -@@ pat@@ ent ."
"So even with this re@@ mark@@ able develop@@ ment , we exp@@ ected to l@@ ose ."
And we did .
S@@ ort of .
"E@@ n@@ ds up sp@@ li@@ t deci@@ sion , 2 to 1 ."
"But the two ju@@ d@@ ges who r@@ ul@@ ed against us , did so for completely different reas@@ ons ."
"The first one , J@@ u@@ dge L@@ ou@@ ri@@ e , made up his own no@@ vel , bio@@ logical the@@ ory — t@@ ot@@ ally wrong ."
( Laughter ) He decided M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad had created a new che@@ mi@@ cal — made ab@@ solu@@ tely no sense .
"M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad didn &apos;t even ar@@ gu@@ e this , so it came out of the bl@@ ue ."
"The other , J@@ u@@ dge M@@ o@@ ore , said she basically ag@@ re@@ ed with us that is@@ ol@@ ated DNA is a produc@@ t of nature ."
"But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to sha@@ ke up the bi@@ ot@@ ec@@ h indu@@ stry . &quot; &quot; The third , J@@ u@@ dge B@@ r@@ y@@ son , ag@@ re@@ ed with us ."
So now we s@@ ou@@ ght re@@ view by the S@@ u@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
"And when you pe@@ ti@@ tion the S@@ u@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , you have to pres@@ ent a question that you want the C@@ our@@ t to answer ."
"@@ U@@ su@@ ally these questions take the form of a super@@ -@@ long par@@ ag@@ r@@ ap@@ h , like a whole p@@ age long with lots and lots of cla@@ uses , &quot; wh@@ er@@ e@@ in this &quot; and &quot; ther@@ e@@ fore that . &quot;"
We sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted perhaps the sh@@ or@@ test question pre@@ sen@@ ted ever .
F@@ our words : A@@ re human gen@@ es pat@@ ent@@ able ?
"Now when Ch@@ r@@ is first asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know ."
"I think you have to say , &apos; I@@ s is@@ ol@@ ated DNA pat@@ ent@@ able ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ op@@ e ."
"I want the j@@ us@@ tic@@ es to have the very same re@@ action that I had when you b@@ rought this issu@@ e to me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly couldn &apos;t ar@@ gu@@ e with that ."
"The S@@ u@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t only hear@@ s about one percent of the ca@@ ses that it re@@ cei@@ ves , and it ag@@ re@@ ed to hear ours ."
"The day of the or@@ al ar@@ gu@@ ment ar@@ ri@@ ves , and it was really , really exc@@ iting — long line of people outside , people had been st@@ anding in line since 2 : 30 in the mor@@ ning to try to get into the cour@@ thou@@ se ."
"T@@ w@@ o brea@@ st cancer organ@@ iz@@ ations , B@@ rea@@ st C@@ anc@@ er A@@ c@@ tion and F@@ O@@ R@@ C@@ E , had organ@@ ized a de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion on the cour@@ thou@@ se ste@@ ps ."
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is and I s@@ at qu@@ i@@ e@@ tly in the h@@ all@@ way , mom@@ ents before he was to walk in and ar@@ gu@@ e the most important case of his care@@ er ."
I was c@@ lear@@ ly more ner@@ v@@ ous than he was .
"But any re@@ ma@@ ining p@@ an@@ ic sub@@ si@@ ded as I wal@@ ked into the cour@@ t@@ room and looked around at a se@@ a of fri@@ end@@ ly fac@@ es : our individu@@ al women c@@ li@@ ents who had shar@@ ed their de@@ ep@@ ly pers@@ onal stories , the gen@@ e@@ tici@@ sts who had taken huge ch@@ un@@ ks of time out of their bus@@ y care@@ ers to de@@ di@@ cate themselves to this fi@@ ght and re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves from a di@@ ver@@ se ar@@ r@@ ay of medi@@ cal , pati@@ ent ad@@ vo@@ ca@@ cy , environ@@ mental and reli@@ gi@@ ous organ@@ iz@@ ations , who had sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted friend of the cour@@ t bri@@ e@@ f@@ s in the case ."
"A@@ l@@ so in the room were three lead@@ ers of the H@@ u@@ man G@@ en@@ ome P@@ ro@@ ject , inclu@@ ding the co@@ -@@ disco@@ ver@@ er of DNA hi@@ m@@ self , J@@ am@@ es W@@ at@@ son , who had sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted a bri@@ e@@ f to the cour@@ t , where he re@@ fer@@ red to gen@@ e pat@@ en@@ ting as &quot; &quot; l@@ un@@ acy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The di@@ ver@@ sity of the communi@@ ties re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted in this room and the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions each had made to make this day a reality sp@@ o@@ ke v@@ ol@@ um@@ es to what was at sta@@ ke ."
The ar@@ gu@@ ment itself was ri@@ ve@@ ting .
Ch@@ r@@ is ar@@ gu@@ ed bri@@ l@@ li@@ antly .
"But for me , the most th@@ ri@@ l@@ ling as@@ p@@ ect was wat@@ ching the S@@ u@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t j@@ us@@ tic@@ es gr@@ app@@ le with is@@ ol@@ ated DNA , through a ser@@ ies of col@@ or@@ ful anal@@ o@@ gi@@ es and fe@@ ist@@ y ex@@ chan@@ ges , very much the same way as our le@@ g@@ al team had done for the past seven years ."
J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce K@@ ag@@ an li@@ k@@ en@@ ed is@@ ol@@ ating DNA to ex@@ trac@@ ting a medi@@ c@@ in@@ al pl@@ ant from the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on .
J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce R@@ ob@@ er@@ ts dist@@ in@@ gu@@ i@@ shed it from car@@ ving a ba@@ se@@ b@@ all b@@ at from a t@@ ree .
"And in one of my ab@@ solu@@ tely fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite mom@@ ents , J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce S@@ ot@@ om@@ a@@ y@@ or pro@@ cla@@ im@@ ed is@@ ol@@ ated DNA to be &quot; &quot; just nature sit@@ ting there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt pretty con@@ fi@@ dent lea@@ ving the cour@@ t@@ room that day , but I could never have an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated the out@@ come : n@@ ine to z@@ er@@ o ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; A nat@@ ur@@ ally oc@@ curr@@ ing DNA se@@ g@@ ment is a produc@@ t of nature , and not pat@@ ent@@ -@@ e@@ li@@ gi@@ ble mer@@ ely because it has been is@@ ol@@ ated ."
"And f@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did not create anything . &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ in 2@@ 4 hours of the deci@@ sion , five l@@ ab@@ s had an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ed that they would beg@@ in to off@@ er te@@ sting for the B@@ R@@ C@@ A gen@@ es ."
S@@ ome of them pr@@ om@@ is@@ ed to off@@ er the te@@ sts at a lo@@ wer pri@@ ce than M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s .
S@@ ome pr@@ om@@ is@@ ed to provi@@ de a more com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sive test than the one M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad was off@@ ering .
But of course the deci@@ sion goes far be@@ y@@ on@@ d M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
It ends a 2@@ 5@@ -@@ year pr@@ acti@@ ce of allo@@ wing pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es in the United States .
It c@@ lear@@ s a sign@@ i@@ fic@@ ant bar@@ ri@@ er to bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal disco@@ very and inno@@ v@@ ation .
"And it hel@@ ps to en@@ sure that patients like A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en and E@@ i@@ le@@ en have ac@@ cess to the te@@ sts that they need ."
"A few weeks after the cour@@ t issu@@ ed its deci@@ sion , I re@@ cei@@ ved a small p@@ ack@@ age in the ma@@ il ."
"It was from B@@ o@@ b C@@ oo@@ k@@ -@@ D@@ e@@ e@@ g@@ an , a prof@@ ess@@ or at D@@ u@@ ke U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sity and one the very first people Ch@@ r@@ is and I went to vi@@ s@@ it when we started to consi@@ der whether to bring this case ."
I op@@ en@@ ed it up to find a small stu@@ ff@@ ed an@@ ima@@ l .
( Laughter ) We took a big risk in taking this case .
P@@ art of what gave us the cou@@ ra@@ ge to take that risk was kno@@ wing that we were doing the right thing .
"The process took ne@@ arly e@@ ight years from the start to fin@@ ish , with many tw@@ i@@ sts and turns along the way ."
"A little l@@ uc@@ k cer@@ tain@@ ly help@@ ed , but it was the communi@@ ties that we bri@@ d@@ ged , the al@@ li@@ anc@@ es that we created , that made pi@@ gs f@@ ly ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
The second quot@@ e is from the head of the U@@ K F@@ in@@ anci@@ al S@@ er@@ v@@ ices Au@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , the answer is y@@ es ."
"Th@@ en , predic@@ tions can be made and te@@ sted ."
So what do we know about comple@@ x systems ?
So the whole is liter@@ ally more than the su@@ m of its parts .
Wh@@ ere are econom@@ ic net@@ works ?
What we looked at in de@@ ta@@ il was o@@ w@@ ner@@ ship net@@ works .
And we also as@@ si@@ gn a val@@ ue to the company given by the oper@@ ating re@@ ven@@ ue .
How are they organ@@ ized ? A@@ re they is@@ ol@@ ated ?
"Th@@ ese are companies that oper@@ ate in more than one country , and we found 4@@ 3@@ ,000 ."
Let me expla@@ in by giving you this anal@@ o@@ gy .
"H@@ i . T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m going to take you through g@@ li@@ mp@@ ses of about e@@ ight of my pro@@ jects , done in coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation with D@@ an@@ ish arti@@ st S@@ o@@ re@@ n P@@ ors ."
"We call ourselves P@@ ors and R@@ a@@ o , and we live and work in In@@ dia ."
"I &apos;d like to beg@@ in with my very first ob@@ ject , which I call &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was insp@@ i@@ red by my un@@ cle &apos;s p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar ha@@ bit of con@@ st@@ antly as@@ king me to do things for him , almost like I were an ex@@ ten@@ sion of his body — to turn on the li@@ ghts or to bring him a g@@ la@@ ss of water , a p@@ ack of ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ t@@ es ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , it became wor@@ se and wor@@ se , And I started to think of it as a form of control ."
"But of course , I could never say anything , because the un@@ cle is a re@@ spec@@ ted figure in the In@@ di@@ an family ."
And the situ@@ ation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ sti@@ fied me the most was his use of a l@@ and@@ line t@@ ele@@ phone .
He would h@@ old on to the re@@ cei@@ ver and exp@@ ect me to di@@ al a number for him .
"And so as a respon@@ se and as a gi@@ ft to my un@@ cle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requ@@ i@@ res two people to use it ."
It &apos;s exactly the way my un@@ cle uses a phone that &apos;s design@@ ed for one person .
"But the problem is that , when I left home and went to colle@@ ge , I started mi@@ ssing his comm@@ ands ."
And so I made him a go@@ l@@ den t@@ y@@ pe@@ wr@@ it@@ er through which he could di@@ sp@@ en@@ se his comm@@ ands to ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws and ni@@ ec@@ es around the world as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So what he had to do was take a piece of p@@ aper , ro@@ ll it into the car@@ ri@@ age , typ@@ e his e@@ ma@@ il or comm@@ and and pul@@ l the p@@ aper out ."
This dev@@ ice would au@@ tom@@ ati@@ c@@ ally s@@ end the in@@ ten@@ ded person the le@@ tter as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So here you can see , we em@@ be@@ d@@ ded a lot of elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics that underst@@ ands all of the m@@ ech@@ an@@ i@@ cal ac@@ tions and conver@@ ts it to di@@ g@@ ital ."
So my un@@ cle is only de@@ al@@ ing with a m@@ ech@@ an@@ i@@ cal inter@@ face .
"And of course , the ob@@ ject had to be very gr@@ and and have a sense of r@@ it@@ u@@ al@@ ism , the way my un@@ cle li@@ kes it ."
"The next work is a s@@ oun@@ d-@@ sen@@ si@@ tive inst@@ al@@ lation that we aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately call &quot; &quot; The P@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a n@@ oti@@ on of being sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sen@@ si@@ tive and s@@ we@@ et cre@@ at@@ u@@ res ."
"So how it works is we have these p@@ an@@ els , which we have on the w@@ all , and behind them , we have these little cre@@ at@@ u@@ res which hi@@ de ."
"And as so@@ on as it &apos;s si@@ l@@ ent , they sort of cre@@ ep out ."
"And if it &apos;s even more si@@ l@@ ent , they stre@@ t@@ ch their nec@@ ks out ."
"And at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hi@@ de back again ."
So we had these p@@ an@@ els on three w@@ all@@ s of a room .
And we had over 5@@ 00 of these little p@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es hi@@ ding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"So when it &apos;s qu@@ i@@ et , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the p@@ an@@ els ."
"And they hear like humans do , or real cre@@ at@@ u@@ res do ."
So they get im@@ m@@ un@@ e to s@@ ounds that sc@@ are them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t re@@ act to b@@ ack@@ ground s@@ ounds .
You &apos;ll hear a tra@@ in in moment that they don &apos;t re@@ act to .
( N@@ o@@ ise ) But they re@@ act to fore@@ ground s@@ ounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( W@@ hi@@ st@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as li@@ fe@@ like as possible .
"So each p@@ y@@ g@@ my has its own behavi@@ or , p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e , m@@ ood s@@ w@@ ings , pers@@ on@@ ali@@ ties and so on ."
So this is a very early prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"O@@ f course , it got much better after that ."
"And we made them re@@ act to people , but we found that people were being quite pla@@ y@@ ful and chil@@ d@@ like with them ."
This is a video inst@@ al@@ lation called &quot; &quot; The M@@ is@@ sing P@@ er@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with pla@@ ying with the n@@ oti@@ on of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility ?
"So we worked with a company that speci@@ al@@ iz@@ es in camer@@ a sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance , and we asked them to devel@@ op a piece of so@@ f@@ tw@@ are with us , using a camer@@ a that could look at people in the room , tr@@ ack them and re@@ place one person with the b@@ ack@@ ground , r@@ en@@ der@@ ing them in@@ vi@@ sible ."
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"O@@ n the right side you can see my colle@@ ag@@ ue S@@ o@@ re@@ n , who &apos;s actually in the space ."
"And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the pro@@ cess@@ ed video where the camer@@ a has made him in@@ vi@@ sible ."
S@@ o@@ re@@ n en@@ ters the room . P@@ op ! He goes in@@ vi@@ sible .
And you can see that the camer@@ a is trac@@ king him and er@@ as@@ ing .
"It &apos;s a very early video , so we ha@@ ven &apos;t yet de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty so@@ on , later ."
"So how we used it was in a room where we had a camer@@ a looking into the space , and we had one mon@@ it@@ or , one on each w@@ all ."
"And as people wal@@ ked into the room , they would see themselves in the mon@@ it@@ or , ex@@ cept with one difference : one person was con@@ st@@ antly in@@ vi@@ sible wh@@ er@@ ever they mo@@ ved in the room ."
"So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The S@@ u@@ n S@@ ha@@ d@@ ow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sh@@ e@@ et of p@@ aper , like a cu@@ t@@ out of a chil@@ d@@ like dra@@ wing of an o@@ il sp@@ ill or a su@@ n ."
"And from the front , this ob@@ ject appe@@ ar@@ ed to be very str@@ ong and ro@@ b@@ ust , and from the side , it almost se@@ em@@ ed very w@@ ea@@ k ."
"So people would wal@@ king into the room and they &apos;d almost i@@ gn@@ ore it , thinking it was some cra@@ p la@@ ying around ."
"But as so@@ on as they pas@@ sed by , it would start to clim@@ b up the w@@ all in j@@ er@@ k@@ y fa@@ shi@@ on ."
"And it would get ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted , and it would coll@@ ap@@ se every time ."
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ i@@ ca@@ ture of an up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down man .
"H@@ is head is so hea@@ v@@ y , full of hea@@ v@@ y thou@@ ghts , that it &apos;s sort of f@@ all@@ en into his h@@ at , and his body &apos;s gro@@ wn out of him almost like a pl@@ ant ."
Well what he does is he mo@@ ves around in a very dr@@ un@@ ken fa@@ shi@@ on on his head in a very un@@ predic@@ table and extre@@ me@@ ly s@@ low move@@ ment .
And it &apos;s kind of con@@ stra@@ ined by that cir@@ cle .
"Because if that cir@@ cle wer@@ en &apos;t there , and the flo@@ or was very even , it would start to wan@@ der about in the space ."
And there &apos;s no wi@@ res .
"So I &apos;ll just show you an inst@@ ance — so when people en@@ ter the room , it acti@@ v@@ ates this ob@@ ject ."
"And it very s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , over a few minutes , sort of pa@@ in@@ fully goes up , and then it ga@@ ins mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to f@@ all ."
"And this is an important moment , because we wanted to in@@ still in the vi@@ e@@ wer an inst@@ inc@@ t to almost go and help , or sa@@ ve the sub@@ ject ."
"But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ages to pul@@ l itself up ."
"So this work was a real tech@@ ni@@ cal challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the m@@ ech@@ an@@ ics right and the equ@@ i@@ li@@ bri@@ um and the d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
"And it was very important for us to est@@ ab@@ lish the ex@@ act moment that it would f@@ all , because if we made it in a way that it would t@@ opp@@ le over , then it would da@@ ma@@ ge itself , and if it didn &apos;t f@@ all enough , it w@@ ouldn &apos;t in@@ still that f@@ at@@ al@@ ism , or that sense of wan@@ ting to go and help it ."
So I &apos;m going to show you a very quic@@ k video where we are doing a test sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o — it &apos;s much fa@@ ster .
That &apos;s my colle@@ ag@@ ue . He &apos;s let it go .
"Now he &apos;s getting ner@@ v@@ ous , so he &apos;s going to go ca@@ t@@ ch it ."
"But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ages to li@@ ft itself up on its own ."
"So this is a work that we were very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with , working with the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic of fu@@ r em@@ be@@ d@@ ded with thousands of tin@@ y different si@@ z@@ es of fi@@ ber op@@ tics , which tw@@ in@@ k@@ le like the night sk@@ y ."
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sk@@ y .
"So we wr@@ app@@ ed this around a b@@ lob@@ -@@ like form , which is in the sh@@ ape of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which was h@@ an@@ ging from the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
"And the idea was to sort of con@@ tra@@ st something very co@@ ld and dist@@ ant and ab@@ str@@ act like the universe into the fami@@ li@@ ar form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which is very com@@ for@@ ting and in@@ tim@@ ate ."
"And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar and you would almost per@@ cei@@ ve it to be a h@@ ole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling night sk@@ y ."
"So this is the last work , and a work in pro@@ gre@@ ss , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ace F@@ ill@@ er . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big st@@ anding in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you appro@@ ach@@ ed it , it tried to in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ate you by gro@@ wing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s tw@@ ice its he@@ ight and &#91; e@@ ight &#93; times its v@@ olu@@ me ."
And so this ob@@ ject is con@@ st@@ antly exp@@ anding and con@@ trac@@ ting to create a d@@ y@@ na@@ mic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a sec@@ re@@ t within its se@@ a@@ ms or something .
"So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gi@@ ves us a lot of pa@@ in in our work over years and years ."
But we use it because we &apos;re interest@@ ed in the way that it can help us to ex@@ pre@@ ss the emoti@@ ons and behavi@@ or@@ al pat@@ ter@@ ns in these cre@@ at@@ u@@ res that we create .
"And once a cre@@ ature pop@@ s into our min@@ ds , it &apos;s almost like the process of cre@@ ation is to disco@@ ver the way this cre@@ ature really wan@@ ts to ex@@ ist and what form it wan@@ ts to take and what way it wan@@ ts to move ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m really g@@ la@@ d to be here .
"I &apos;m g@@ la@@ d you &apos;re here , because that would be a little we@@ ird ."
I &apos;m g@@ la@@ d we &apos;re all here .
"And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here ."
O@@ r here .
But here .
I mean Earth .
"And by &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean those of us in this au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um , but life , all life on Earth — ( Laughter ) from comple@@ x to sing@@ le@@ -@@ c@@ ell@@ ed , from mo@@ ld to mu@@ sh@@ ro@@ om@@ s to fl@@ ying be@@ ar@@ s . ( Laughter )@@ "
"The interesting thing is , Earth is the only place we know of that has life — 8@@ .@@ 7 million species ."
"We &apos;ve looked other places , maybe not as hard as we should or we could , but we &apos;ve looked and ha@@ ven &apos;t found any ; Earth is the only place we know of with life ."
I@@ s Earth speci@@ al ?
"This is a question I &apos;ve wanted to know the answer to since I was a small child , and I su@@ sp@@ ect 80 percent of this au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um has thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer ."
"T@@ o understand whether there are any plan@@ ets — out there in our so@@ lar system or be@@ y@@ on@@ d — that can supp@@ ort life , the first ste@@ p is to understand what life here requ@@ i@@ res ."
"It turns out , of all of those 8@@ .@@ 7 million species , life only needs three things ."
"O@@ n one side , all life on Earth needs energy ."
"C@@ om@@ p@@ le@@ x life like us der@@ i@@ ves our energy from the su@@ n , but life de@@ ep under@@ ground can get its energy from things like che@@ mi@@ cal re@@ ac@@ tions ."
There are a number of different energy sources a@@ va@@ il@@ able on all plan@@ ets .
"O@@ n the other side , all life needs food or n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ment ."
"And this see@@ ms like a t@@ all order , esp@@ eci@@ ally if you want a suc@@ cul@@ ent tom@@ a@@ to ."
"( Laughter ) H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , all life on Earth der@@ i@@ ves its n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ment from only six che@@ mi@@ cal el@@ em@@ ents , and these el@@ em@@ ents can be found on any plan@@ et@@ ary body in our so@@ lar system ."
"So that lea@@ ves the thing in the middle as the t@@ all po@@ le , the thing that &apos;s har@@ de@@ st to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve ."
"N@@ ot mo@@ ose , but water ."
( Laughter ) Al@@ though mo@@ ose would be pretty c@@ ool . ( Laughter )
"And not f@@ ro@@ z@@ en water , and not water in a ga@@ se@@ ous state , but li@@ qu@@ id water ."
"This is what life needs to survi@@ ve , all life ."
"And many so@@ lar system bo@@ dies don &apos;t have li@@ qu@@ id water , and so we don &apos;t look there ."
"O@@ ther so@@ lar system bo@@ dies might have ab@@ und@@ ant li@@ qu@@ id water , even more than Earth , but it &apos;s tr@@ app@@ ed b@@ ene@@ ath an ic@@ y sh@@ ell , and so it &apos;s hard to ac@@ cess , it &apos;s hard to get to , it &apos;s hard to even find out if there &apos;s any life there ."
So that lea@@ ves a few bo@@ dies that we should think about .
So let &apos;s make the problem simp@@ l@@ er for ourselves .
Let &apos;s think only about li@@ qu@@ id water on the sur@@ face of a planet .
"There are only three bo@@ dies to think about in our so@@ lar system , with re@@ g@@ ard to li@@ qu@@ id water on the sur@@ face of a planet , and in order of dist@@ ance from the su@@ n , it &apos;s : V@@ en@@ us , Earth and Mar@@ s ."
You want to have an at@@ m@@ osp@@ here for water to be li@@ qu@@ id .
You have to be very care@@ ful with that at@@ m@@ osp@@ here .
"You can &apos;t have too much at@@ m@@ osp@@ here , too th@@ ic@@ k or too war@@ m an at@@ m@@ osp@@ here , because then you end up too h@@ ot like V@@ en@@ us , and you can &apos;t have li@@ qu@@ id water ."
"But if you have too little at@@ m@@ osp@@ here and it &apos;s too th@@ in and too co@@ ld , you end up like Mar@@ s , too co@@ ld ."
"So V@@ en@@ us is too h@@ ot , Mar@@ s is too co@@ ld , and Earth is just right ."
You can look at these images behind me and you can see au@@ tom@@ ati@@ c@@ ally where life can survi@@ ve in our so@@ lar system .
"It &apos;s a G@@ ol@@ di@@ lo@@ ck@@ s@@ -@@ typ@@ e problem , and it &apos;s so simple that a child could understand it ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , I &apos;d like to re@@ mind you of two things from the G@@ ol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks story that we may not think about so often but that I think are really re@@ le@@ v@@ ant here ."
"N@@ um@@ ber one : if M@@ am@@ a B@@ ear &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too co@@ ld when G@@ ol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks wal@@ ks into the room , does that mean it &apos;s always been too co@@ ld ?"
O@@ r could it have been just right at some other time ?
Wh@@ en G@@ ol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks wal@@ ks into the room de@@ ter@@ min@@ es the answer that we get in the story .
And the same is true with plan@@ ets .
They &apos;re not st@@ ati@@ c things . They change .
They v@@ ary . They ev@@ ol@@ ve .
And at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ es do the same .
So let me give you an example .
Here &apos;s one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite pic@@ tures of Mar@@ s .
"It &apos;s not the high@@ est re@@ solu@@ tion image , it &apos;s not the se@@ x@@ i@@ est image , it &apos;s not the most rec@@ ent image , but it &apos;s an image that sho@@ ws ri@@ ver@@ be@@ ds c@@ ut into the sur@@ face of the planet ; ri@@ ver@@ be@@ ds car@@ ved by flo@@ wing , li@@ qu@@ id water ; ri@@ ver@@ be@@ ds that take hund@@ reds or thousands or ten@@ s of thousands of years to form ."
This can &apos;t happen on Mar@@ s today .
The at@@ m@@ osp@@ here of Mar@@ s today is too th@@ in and too co@@ ld for water to be st@@ able as a li@@ qu@@ id .
"This one image t@@ ells you that the at@@ m@@ osp@@ here of Mar@@ s changed , and it changed in big ways ."
"And it changed from a state that we would de@@ f@@ ine as ha@@ b@@ it@@ able , because the three requ@@ i@@ re@@ ments for life were pres@@ ent long ago ."
Wh@@ ere did that at@@ m@@ osp@@ here go that allo@@ wed water to be li@@ qu@@ id at the sur@@ face ?
"Well , one idea is it es@@ cap@@ ed away to space ."
"A@@ t@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ ic par@@ ti@@ cl@@ es got enough energy to brea@@ k free from the gra@@ vity of the planet , es@@ cap@@ ing away to space , never to re@@ turn ."
And this happens with all bo@@ dies with at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ es .
C@@ ome@@ ts have ta@@ il@@ s that are incredi@@ bly vi@@ sible re@@ min@@ ders of at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ ic es@@ cap@@ e .
"But V@@ en@@ us also has an at@@ m@@ osp@@ here that es@@ cap@@ es with time , and Mar@@ s and Earth as well ."
It &apos;s just a matter of de@@ gre@@ e and a matter of scale .
So we &apos;d like to figure out how much es@@ cap@@ ed over time so we can expla@@ in this tran@@ si@@ tion .
How do at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ es get their energy for es@@ cap@@ e ?
How do par@@ ti@@ cl@@ es get enough energy to es@@ cap@@ e ?
"There are two ways , if we &apos;re going to re@@ duce things a little bit ."
"N@@ um@@ ber one , s@@ un@@ light ."
L@@ ight em@@ it@@ ted from the su@@ n can be ab@@ sor@@ bed by at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ ic par@@ ti@@ cl@@ es and war@@ m the par@@ ti@@ cl@@ es .
"@@ Y@@ es , I &apos;m d@@ anc@@ ing , but they — ( Laughter ) O@@ h my G@@ od , not even at my we@@ d@@ ding . ( Laughter )@@ "
They get enough energy to es@@ cap@@ e and brea@@ k free from the gra@@ vity of the planet just by war@@ m@@ ing .
A second way they can get energy is from the so@@ lar w@@ ind .
"Th@@ ese are par@@ ti@@ cl@@ es , ma@@ ss , materi@@ al , sp@@ it out from the sur@@ face of the su@@ n , and they go scre@@ am@@ ing through the so@@ lar system at 4@@ 00 k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters per second , sometimes fa@@ ster during so@@ lar stor@@ ms , and they go h@@ ur@@ t@@ ling through inter@@ plan@@ et@@ ary space to@@ wards plan@@ ets and their at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ es , and they may provi@@ de energy for at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ ic par@@ ti@@ cl@@ es to es@@ cap@@ e as well ."
"This is something that I &apos;m interest@@ ed in , because it re@@ l@@ ates to ha@@ b@@ it@@ ability ."
"I m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed that there were two things about the G@@ ol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks story that I wanted to bring to your atten@@ tion and re@@ mind you about , and the second one is a little bit more sub@@ tle ."
"If P@@ ap@@ a B@@ ear &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too h@@ ot , and M@@ am@@ a B@@ ear &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too co@@ ld , sh@@ ouldn &apos;t B@@ ab@@ y B@@ ear &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l be even col@@ der if we &apos;re follo@@ wing the tr@@ end ?"
"This thing that you &apos;ve ac@@ cep@@ ted your entire life , when you think about it a little bit more , may not be so simple ."
"And of course , dist@@ ance of a planet from the su@@ n de@@ ter@@ min@@ es its te@@ m@@ per@@ ature ."
This has to play into ha@@ b@@ it@@ ability .
But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
"M@@ a@@ ybe it &apos;s the bo@@ w@@ ls themselves that are also help@@ ing to de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine the out@@ come in the story , what is just right ."
"I could talk to you about a lot of different char@@ acter@@ is@@ tics of these three plan@@ ets that may in@@ flu@@ ence ha@@ b@@ it@@ ability , but for sel@@ fish reas@@ ons re@@ l@@ ated to my own research and the fact that I &apos;m st@@ anding up here hol@@ ding the c@@ lic@@ ker and you &apos;re not — ( Laughter ) I would like to talk for just a min@@ u@@ te or two about ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds ."
Earth has one ; V@@ en@@ us and Mar@@ s do not .
M@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds are gener@@ ated in the de@@ ep inter@@ i@@ or of a planet by electri@@ c@@ ally con@@ duc@@ ting ch@@ ur@@ ning flu@@ id materi@@ al that cre@@ ates this big old ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic field that sur@@ r@@ ounds Earth .
"If you have a comp@@ as@@ s , you know which way nor@@ th is ."
V@@ en@@ us and Mar@@ s don &apos;t have that .
"If you have a comp@@ as@@ s on V@@ en@@ us and Mar@@ s , con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ la@@ tions , you &apos;re lost ."
( Laughter ) D@@ o@@ es this in@@ flu@@ ence ha@@ b@@ it@@ ability ?
"Well , how might it ?"
"M@@ any scientists think that a ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic field of a planet ser@@ ves as a shi@@ el@@ d for the at@@ m@@ osp@@ here , de@@ fl@@ ec@@ ting so@@ lar w@@ ind par@@ ti@@ cl@@ es around the planet in a bit of a for@@ ce fiel@@ d-@@ typ@@ e eff@@ ect having to do with electri@@ c char@@ ge of those par@@ ti@@ cl@@ es ."
I like to think of it instead as a s@@ al@@ ad b@@ ar s@@ nee@@ ze gu@@ ard for plan@@ ets .
"( Laughter ) And y@@ es , my colle@@ ag@@ ues who wat@@ ch this later will real@@ ize this is the first time in the history of our community that the so@@ lar w@@ ind has been equ@@ ated with m@@ uc@@ us . ( Laughter )@@ "
"O@@ K , so the eff@@ ect , then , is that Earth may have been prot@@ ected for b@@ illions of years , because we &apos;ve had a ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic field ."
A@@ t@@ m@@ osp@@ here ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t been able to es@@ cap@@ e .
"M@@ ar@@ s , on the other hand , has been un@@ prot@@ ected because of its l@@ ack of ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic field , and over b@@ illions of years , maybe enough at@@ m@@ osp@@ here has been stri@@ pp@@ ed away to ac@@ coun@@ t for a tran@@ si@@ tion from a ha@@ b@@ it@@ able planet to the planet that we see today ."
"O@@ ther scientists think that ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds may act more like the sa@@ il@@ s on a ship , en@@ ab@@ ling the planet to inter@@ act with more energy from the so@@ lar w@@ ind than the planet would have been able to inter@@ act with by itself ."
The sa@@ il@@ s may ga@@ ther energy from the so@@ lar w@@ ind .
The ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic field may ga@@ ther energy from the so@@ lar w@@ ind that allo@@ ws even more at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ ic es@@ cap@@ e to happen .
"It &apos;s an idea that has to be te@@ sted , but the eff@@ ect and how it works see@@ ms ap@@ par@@ ent ."
That &apos;s because we know energy from the so@@ lar w@@ ind is being de@@ pos@@ ited into our at@@ m@@ osp@@ here here on Earth .
"That energy is con@@ duc@@ ted along ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic field l@@ ines down into the po@@ lar regi@@ ons , resul@@ ting in incredi@@ bly beautiful a@@ ur@@ or@@ a ."
"If you &apos;ve ever experi@@ enc@@ ed them , it &apos;s ma@@ gn@@ i@@ fic@@ ent ."
We know the energy is getting in .
We &apos;re trying to meas@@ ure how many par@@ ti@@ cl@@ es are getting out and if the ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic field is in@@ flu@@ enc@@ ing this in any way .
"So I &apos;ve pos@@ ed a problem for you here , but I don &apos;t have a solu@@ tion yet ."
We don &apos;t have a solu@@ tion .
But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
"Well , we &apos;ve s@@ ent sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft to all three plan@@ ets ."
"S@@ ome of them are or@@ b@@ iting now , inclu@@ ding the M@@ A@@ V@@ E@@ N sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft which is curr@@ ently or@@ b@@ iting Mar@@ s , which I &apos;m inv@@ olved with and which is led here , out of the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sity of C@@ ol@@ or@@ a@@ do ."
It &apos;s design@@ ed to meas@@ ure at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ ic es@@ cap@@ e .
We have si@@ mil@@ ar meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments from V@@ en@@ us and Earth .
"O@@ n@@ ce we have all our meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , we can com@@ b@@ ine all these together , and we can understand how all three plan@@ ets inter@@ act with their space environment , with the sur@@ r@@ ound@@ ings ."
And we can deci@@ de whether ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds are important for ha@@ b@@ it@@ ability or not .
"O@@ n@@ ce we have that answer , why should you care ?"
"I mean , I care de@@ ep@@ ly ..@@ ."
"And fin@@ anci@@ ally as well , but de@@ ep@@ ly ."
"( Laughter ) F@@ ir@@ st of all , an answer to this question will te@@ ach us more about these three plan@@ ets , V@@ en@@ us , Earth and Mar@@ s , not only about how they inter@@ act with their environment today , but how they were b@@ illions of years ago , whether they were ha@@ b@@ it@@ able long ago or not ."
It will te@@ ach us about at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ es that sur@@ r@@ ound us and that are close .
"But mo@@ re@@ over , what we learn from these plan@@ ets can be app@@ li@@ ed to at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ es every@@ where , inclu@@ ding plan@@ ets that we &apos;re now ob@@ ser@@ ving around other star@@ s ."
"For example , the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft , which is built and contro@@ l@@ led here in B@@ ou@@ l@@ der , has been ob@@ ser@@ ving a pos@@ ta@@ ge sta@@ mp@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed regi@@ on of the sk@@ y for a couple years now , and it &apos;s found thousands of plan@@ ets — in one pos@@ ta@@ ge sta@@ mp@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed regi@@ on of the sk@@ y that we don &apos;t think is any different from any other part of the sk@@ y ."
"We &apos;ve g@@ one , in 20 years , from kno@@ wing of z@@ er@@ o plan@@ ets outside of our so@@ lar system , to now having so many , that we don &apos;t know which ones to inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate first ."
An@@ y le@@ ver will help .
"In fact , based on ob@@ serv@@ ations that K@@ e@@ pl@@ er &apos;s taken and other si@@ mil@@ ar ob@@ serv@@ ations , we now believe that , of the 200 billion star@@ s in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y alone , on a@@ verage , every st@@ ar has at least one planet ."
"In ad@@ di@@ tion to that , es@@ ti@@ mat@@ es su@@ g@@ gest there are some@@ where between 40 billion and 100 billion of those plan@@ ets that we would de@@ f@@ ine as ha@@ b@@ it@@ able in just our g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y ."
"We have the ob@@ serv@@ ations of those plan@@ ets , but we just don &apos;t know which ones are ha@@ b@@ it@@ able yet ."
"It &apos;s a little bit like being tr@@ app@@ ed on a red sp@@ ot — ( Laughter ) on a st@@ age and kno@@ wing that there are other wor@@ l@@ ds out there and de@@ s@@ per@@ ately wan@@ ting to know more about them , wan@@ ting to inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them are a little bit like you ."
"You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet ."
"And so you have to use the to@@ ols that you &apos;ve develop@@ ed around you for V@@ en@@ us , Earth and Mar@@ s , and you have to app@@ ly them to these other situ@@ ations , and hope that you &apos;re making reas@@ on@@ able inf@@ er@@ ences from the data , and that you &apos;re going to be able to de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine the best can@@ di@@ d@@ ates for ha@@ b@@ it@@ able plan@@ ets , and those that are not ."
"In the end , and for now , at least , this is our red sp@@ ot , right here ."
"This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s ha@@ b@@ it@@ able , al@@ though very so@@ on we may come to know of more ."
"But for now , this is the only ha@@ b@@ it@@ able planet , and this is our red sp@@ ot ."
I &apos;m really g@@ la@@ d we &apos;re here .
Th@@ an@@ ks .
( Applause )
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Th@@ ink about everything it has b@@ rought us .
"Th@@ ink about all the serv@@ ices we use , all the connec@@ ti@@ vity , all the en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , all the business , all the comm@@ er@@ ce ."
And it &apos;s happening during our li@@ fe@@ times .
"I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be wr@@ iting history boo@@ ks hund@@ reds of years from now . This time our gener@@ ation will be re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed as the gener@@ ation that got on@@ line , the gener@@ ation that built something really and tru@@ ly global ."
"But y@@ es , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very ser@@ i@@ ous problems , problems with sec@@ ur@@ ity and problems with pri@@ v@@ acy ."
I &apos;ve spent my care@@ er fi@@ gh@@ ting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is B@@ ra@@ in .
This is a flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k — five and a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ ch flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k inf@@ ected by B@@ ra@@ in@@ .@@ A@@ .
It &apos;s the first vir@@ us we ever found for P@@ C compu@@ ters .
And we actually know where B@@ ra@@ in came from .
We know because it says so inside the co@@ de .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
"That &apos;s the boo@@ t sec@@ tor of an inf@@ ected flo@@ pp@@ y , and if we take a clos@@ er look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on . &quot; &quot; And then it contin@@ ues , saying , 19@@ 8@@ 6 , B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ."
"And B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad are first nam@@ es , P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an@@ i first nam@@ es ."
"In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an ad@@ dre@@ ss in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) Now , 19@@ 8@@ 6 ."
Now it &apos;s 20@@ 11 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The P@@ C vir@@ us problem is 25 years old now .
"So half a year ago , I decided to go to P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an myself ."
"So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of phot@@ os I took while I was in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"This is from the city of L@@ a@@ h@@ ore , which is around 3@@ 00 k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters s@@ outh from A@@ b@@ bot@@ t@@ ab@@ ad , where B@@ in L@@ ad@@ en was ca@@ ught ."
Here &apos;s a t@@ y@@ pi@@ cal stre@@ et view .
"And here &apos;s the stre@@ et or ro@@ ad lead@@ ing to this building , which is 7@@ 30 N@@ iz@@ am blo@@ ck at Al@@ la@@ m@@ a I@@ q@@ b@@ al T@@ own ."
And I kno@@ c@@ ked on the do@@ or .
( Laughter ) You want to gu@@ ess who op@@ en@@ ed the do@@ or ?
B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ; they are still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here st@@ anding up is B@@ as@@ it .
S@@ it@@ ting down is his bro@@ ther A@@ m@@ j@@ ad .
These are the guys who wr@@ ote the first P@@ C vir@@ us .
"Now of course , we had a very interesting di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion from learning that both B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad had had their compu@@ ters inf@@ ected do@@ z@@ ens of times by completely un@@ re@@ l@@ ated other vir@@ uses over these years .
So there is some sort of j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce in the world after all .
"Now , the vir@@ uses that we used to see in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s and 199@@ 0s obvi@@ ously are not a problem any more ."
So let me just show you a couple of exa@@ mp@@ les of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m run@@ ning here is a system that en@@ ab@@ les me to run a@@ ge@@ -@@ old progra@@ ms on a mo@@ der@@ n computer .
So let me just m@@ oun@@ t some dri@@ ves . G@@ o over there .
What we have here is a li@@ st of old vir@@ uses .
So let me just run some vir@@ uses on my computer .
"For example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de vir@@ us first ."
"And you can see at the top of the scre@@ en , there &apos;s a c@@ enti@@ pe@@ de sc@@ ro@@ l@@ ling across your computer when you get inf@@ ected by this one ."
You know that you &apos;re inf@@ ected because it actually sho@@ ws up .
"H@@ ere &apos;s another one . This is the vir@@ us called C@@ ra@@ sh , inv@@ en@@ ted in R@@ us@@ si@@ a in 199@@ 2 ."
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
"( S@@ i@@ re@@ n no@@ ise ) And the last example , gu@@ ess what the W@@ al@@ ker vir@@ us does ?"
"@@ Y@@ es , there &apos;s a guy wal@@ king across your scre@@ en once you get inf@@ ected ."
"So it used to be fa@@ ir@@ ly easy to know that you &apos;re inf@@ ected by a vir@@ us , when the vir@@ uses were wr@@ it@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ b@@ y@@ i@@ sts and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are no longer being wr@@ it@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ b@@ y@@ i@@ sts and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , vir@@ uses are a global problem ."
"What we have here in the b@@ ack@@ ground is an example of our systems that we run in our l@@ ab@@ s , where we tr@@ ack vir@@ us inf@@ ec@@ tions wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blo@@ c@@ ked vir@@ uses in S@@ we@@ den and T@@ ai@@ w@@ an and R@@ us@@ si@@ a and el@@ se@@ where .
"In fact , if I just con@@ n@@ ect back to our la@@ b systems through the W@@ e@@ b , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many vir@@ uses , how many new exa@@ mp@@ les of mal@@ w@@ are we find every single day ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s the l@@ ate@@ st vir@@ us we &apos;ve found , in a fi@@ le called S@@ er@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e@@ ."
"And we found it right over here three secon@@ ds ago — the pre@@ vi@@ ous one , six secon@@ ds ago ."
"And if we just sc@@ ro@@ ll around , it &apos;s just ma@@ ssi@@ ve ."
"We find ten@@ s of thousands , even hund@@ reds of thousands ."
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of mal@@ w@@ are every single day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
"Well today , it &apos;s the organ@@ ized cri@@ min@@ al g@@ an@@ gs wr@@ iting these vir@@ uses because they make money with their vir@@ uses ."
It &apos;s g@@ an@@ gs like — let &apos;s go to G@@ ang@@ sta@@ B@@ uc@@ k@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
This is a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite oper@@ ating in M@@ os@@ c@@ ow where these guys are bu@@ ying inf@@ ected compu@@ ters .
"So if you are a vir@@ us wr@@ it@@ er and you &apos;re cap@@ able of inf@@ ec@@ ting W@@ in@@ do@@ ws compu@@ ters , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can s@@ ell those inf@@ ected compu@@ ters — somebody else &apos;s compu@@ ters — to these guys ."
And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those compu@@ ters .
So how do these guys then mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze those inf@@ ected compu@@ ters ?
"Well there &apos;s mul@@ ti@@ ple different ways , such as ban@@ king t@@ ro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your on@@ line ban@@ king ac@@ coun@@ ts when you do on@@ line ban@@ king , or ke@@ y@@ lo@@ g@@ g@@ ers ."
"@@ K@@ ey@@ lo@@ g@@ g@@ ers si@@ l@@ ently s@@ it on your computer , hi@@ dd@@ en from view , and they rec@@ ord everything you typ@@ e ."
So you &apos;re sit@@ ting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Goo@@ gle sear@@ ch@@ es .
E@@ very single Goo@@ gle search you typ@@ e is sa@@ ved and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
E@@ very single e@@ ma@@ il you wr@@ ite is sa@@ ved and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
S@@ a@@ me thing with every single pas@@ s@@ word and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are se@@ ssi@@ ons where you go on@@ line and do on@@ line pur@@ cha@@ ses in any on@@ line st@@ ore .
"Because when you do pur@@ cha@@ ses in on@@ line st@@ o@@ res , you will be typ@@ ing in your name , the deli@@ very ad@@ dre@@ ss , your cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard number and the cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard sec@@ ur@@ ity co@@ des ."
And here &apos;s an example of a fi@@ le we found from a ser@@ ver a couple of weeks ago .
"That &apos;s the cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard number , that &apos;s the exp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion d@@ ate , that &apos;s the sec@@ ur@@ ity co@@ de , and that &apos;s the name of the o@@ w@@ ner of the c@@ ard ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you ga@@ in ac@@ cess to other people &apos;s cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard information , you can just go on@@ line and bu@@ y wh@@ ate@@ ver you want with this information ."
"And that , obvi@@ ously , is a problem ."
We now have a whole under@@ ground mar@@ ke@@ t@@ place and business ec@@ os@@ y@@ ste@@ m built around on@@ line cri@@ me .
One example of how these guys actually are cap@@ able of mon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing their oper@@ ations : we go and have a look at the p@@ ages of I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L and search for wanted pers@@ ons .
"We find guys like B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ und@@ in , ori@@ gin@@ ally from S@@ we@@ den , and his par@@ t@@ ner in cri@@ me , also list@@ ed on the I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L wanted p@@ ages , M@@ r@@ . S@@ ha@@ i@@ le@@ sh@@ k@@ u@@ ma@@ r J@@ a@@ in , a U.@@ S@@ . ci@@ tiz@@ en ."
"Th@@ ese guys were run@@ ning an oper@@ ation called I@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ U@@ . , a cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me oper@@ ation through which they net@@ ted m@@ illions ."
They are both right now on the run .
N@@ o@@ body kno@@ ws where they are .
"@@ U.@@ S@@ . off@@ ici@@ als , just a couple of weeks ago , f@@ ro@@ ze a S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t b@@ el@@ on@@ ging to M@@ r@@ . J@@ a@@ in , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.@@ S@@ . dollars on it ."
So the amount of money on@@ line cri@@ me gener@@ ates is sign@@ i@@ fic@@ ant .
And that means that the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als can actually aff@@ ord to inve@@ st into their att@@ ac@@ ks .
"We know that on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are h@@ ir@@ ing progra@@ mm@@ ers , h@@ ir@@ ing te@@ sting people , te@@ sting their co@@ de , having b@@ ack@@ -@@ end systems with S@@ Q@@ L dat@@ ab@@ ases ."
And they can aff@@ ord to wat@@ ch how we work — like how sec@@ ur@@ ity people work — and try to work their way around any sec@@ ur@@ ity pre@@ ca@@ u@@ tions we can build .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge .
"I mean , the Internet is inter@@ national ."
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
"And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the on@@ line world , here &apos;s a video built by C@@ lar@@ i@@ fied N@@ et@@ works , which ill@@ u@@ str@@ ates how one single mal@@ w@@ are family is able to move around the world ."
"This oper@@ ation , beli@@ ev@@ ed to be ori@@ gin@@ ally from E@@ st@@ on@@ ia , mo@@ ves around from one country to another as so@@ on as the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite is tried to sh@@ ut down ."
So you just can &apos;t sh@@ ut these guys down .
"They will s@@ wit@@ ch from one country to another , from one ju@@ ris@@ dic@@ tion to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability to glob@@ ally poli@@ ce oper@@ ations like this ."
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plan@@ e tic@@ ke@@ ts to all the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als of the world .
"Now , cri@@ min@@ als who wer@@ en &apos;t cap@@ able of re@@ ach@@ ing us before can re@@ ach us ."
So how do you actually go around fin@@ ding on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als ?
How do you actually tr@@ ack them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one exp@@ lo@@ it fi@@ le .
"H@@ ere , I &apos;m looking at the H@@ e@@ x d@@ um@@ p of an image fi@@ le , which con@@ ta@@ ins an exp@@ lo@@ it ."
"And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image fi@@ le on your W@@ in@@ do@@ ws computer , it actually takes over your computer and run@@ s co@@ de ."
"Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image fi@@ le — well there &apos;s the image hea@@ der , and there the ac@@ tual co@@ de of the att@@ ack star@@ ts ."
"And that co@@ de has been enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted , so let &apos;s dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t it ."
It has been enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted with X@@ O@@ R fun@@ c@@ tion 9@@ 7 .
"You just have to believe me , it is , it is ."
And we can go here and actually start dec@@ r@@ yp@@ ting it .
Well the y@@ el@@ low part of the co@@ de is now dec@@ r@@ yp@@ ted .
"And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the ori@@ gin@@ al ."
But just keep star@@ ing at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a W@@ e@@ b ad@@ dre@@ ss : uni@@ on@@ see@@ k@@ .@@ co@@ m / d / i@@ oo@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad and run that progra@@ m .
And that &apos;s a b@@ ack@@ do@@ or which will take over your computer .
"But even more interest@@ ing@@ ly , if we contin@@ ue dec@@ r@@ yp@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous str@@ ing , which says O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
That co@@ de is there under@@ ne@@ ath the enc@@ r@@ yp@@ tion as some sort of a sign@@ ature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
"And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means ."
So obvi@@ ously I Goo@@ g@@ led for it .
I got z@@ er@@ o h@@ its ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I sp@@ o@@ ke with the guys at the la@@ b .
"And we have a couple of R@@ us@@ si@@ an guys in our l@@ ab@@ s , and one of them m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed , well , it ends in R@@ U@@ S like R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
And 7@@ 8 is the city co@@ de for the city of St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
"For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car li@@ cen@@ se pl@@ ates and stuff like that ."
"So I went looking for cont@@ ac@@ ts in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , and through a long ro@@ ad , we ev@@ en@@ tually found this one particular we@@ b@@ s@@ ite ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s this R@@ us@@ si@@ an guy who &apos;s been oper@@ ating on@@ line for a number of years who run@@ s his own we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , and he run@@ s a blo@@ g under the pop@@ ular L@@ i@@ ve J@@ our@@ n@@ al ."
"And on this blo@@ g , he blo@@ gs about his life , about his life in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g — he &apos;s in his early 20@@ s — about his c@@ at , about his gir@@ l@@ friend ."
And he dri@@ ves a very n@@ ice car .
"In fact , this guy dri@@ ves a M@@ er@@ ce@@ de@@ s@@ -@@ B@@ en@@ z S@@ 6@@ 00 V@@ 12 with a si@@ x@@ -@@ lit@@ er en@@ gine with more than 4@@ 00 hor@@ se@@ power ."
Now that &apos;s a n@@ ice car for a 20@@ -@@ something year@@ -@@ old k@@ id in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he blo@@ g@@ ged about the car .
He actually had a car ac@@ ci@@ dent .
"In do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , he actually cra@@ shed his car into another car ."
And he put blo@@ g@@ ged images about the car ac@@ ci@@ dent — that &apos;s his M@@ er@@ ce@@ des — right here is the L@@ ad@@ a S@@ am@@ ar@@ a he cra@@ shed into .
And you can actually see that the li@@ cen@@ se pl@@ ate of the S@@ am@@ ar@@ a ends in 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S .
"And if you actually take a look at the sc@@ en@@ e picture , you can see that the pl@@ ate of the M@@ er@@ ce@@ des is O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
"Now I &apos;m not a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are ca@@ ught ?"
Well in most ca@@ ses it never gets this far .
"The va@@ st maj@@ or@@ ity of the on@@ line cri@@ me ca@@ ses , we don &apos;t even know which contin@@ ent the att@@ ac@@ ks are coming from ."
"And even if we are able to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als , quite often there is no out@@ come ."
"The lo@@ cal poli@@ ce don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evi@@ dence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down ."
I w@@ ish it would be ea@@ si@@ er ; un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately it isn &apos;t .
But things are also chan@@ ging at a very r@@ ap@@ id p@@ ace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like S@@ tu@@ x@@ net .
So if you look at what S@@ tu@@ x@@ net did is that it inf@@ ected these .
"That &apos;s a S@@ i@@ em@@ ens S@@ 7@@ -@@ 4@@ 00 P@@ L@@ C , progra@@ m@@ ma@@ ble logi@@ c &#91; contro@@ l@@ l@@ er &#93; ."
And this is what run@@ s our inf@@ ra@@ structure .
This is what run@@ s everything around us .
"P@@ L@@ C &apos;s , these small bo@@ x@@ es which have no di@@ sp@@ l@@ ay , no ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard , which are progra@@ mm@@ ed , are put in place , and they do their job ."
"For example , the el@@ ev@@ at@@ ors in this building most like@@ ly are contro@@ l@@ led by one of these ."
"And when S@@ tu@@ x@@ net inf@@ ects one of these , that &apos;s a ma@@ ssi@@ ve re@@ v@@ olution on the kinds of ris@@ ks we have to wor@@ ry about ."
Because everything around us is being run by these .
"I mean , we have cri@@ tical inf@@ ra@@ structure ."
"You go to any fac@@ t@@ ory , any power pl@@ ant , any che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant , any food pro@@ cess@@ ing pl@@ ant , you look around — everything is being run by compu@@ ters ."
E@@ very@@ thing is being run by compu@@ ters .
E@@ very@@ thing is reli@@ ant on these compu@@ ters working .
"We have become very reli@@ ant on Internet , on ba@@ si@@ c things like electri@@ city , obvi@@ ously , on compu@@ ters working ."
And this really is something which cre@@ ates completely new problems for us .
We must have some way of contin@@ u@@ ing to work even if compu@@ ters fa@@ il .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So pre@@ par@@ ed@@ ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for gr@@ an@@ ted ar@@ en &apos;t there .
"It &apos;s actually very ba@@ si@@ c stuff — thinking about contin@@ u@@ ity , thinking about b@@ ack@@ u@@ ps , thinking about the things that actually matter ."
Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
Th@@ ink about all the serv@@ ices we have on@@ line .
"Th@@ ink about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another ."
"I see beau@@ ty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we might not see that ."
I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we are run@@ ning into problems because of on@@ line cri@@ me .
O@@ n@@ line cri@@ me is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life de@@ f@@ ending the N@@ et , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fi@@ ght on@@ line cri@@ me , we are run@@ ning a risk of l@@ os@@ ing it all ."
"We have to do this glob@@ ally , and we have to do it right now ."
"What we need is more global , inter@@ national la@@ w en@@ for@@ ce@@ ment work to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ al g@@ an@@ gs — these organ@@ ized g@@ an@@ gs that are making m@@ illions out of their att@@ ac@@ ks ."
That &apos;s much more important than run@@ ning anti@@ -@@ vir@@ uses or run@@ ning fi@@ re@@ w@@ all@@ s .
"What actually mat@@ ters is actually fin@@ ding the people behind these att@@ ac@@ ks , and even more import@@ antly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this on@@ line world of cri@@ me , but ha@@ ven &apos;t yet done it ."
"We have to find the people with the sk@@ ill@@ s , but without the opport@@ uni@@ ties and give them the opport@@ uni@@ ties to use their sk@@ ill@@ s for good ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by off@@ ering you a free no@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h life h@@ ack , and all it requ@@ i@@ res of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ d@@ it of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making y@@ ourselves sm@@ all@@ er ?
S@@ ome@@ times we h@@ old on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we sp@@ read out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay atten@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re partic@@ ul@@ arly interest@@ ed in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interest@@ ed in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a s@@ mi@@ le , or a con@@ te@@ mp@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward w@@ ink , or maybe even something like a h@@ and@@ sha@@ ke ."
N@@ ar@@ r@@ ator : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New York T@@ im@@ es .
"So obvi@@ ously when we think about non@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavi@@ or , or body language — but we call it non@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communi@@ cation ."
"When we think about communi@@ cation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ wee@@ p@@ ing ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments and inf@@ er@@ ences from body language .
"And those ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments can predic@@ t really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we h@@ ire or pr@@ om@@ ote , who we ask out on a d@@ ate ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ in@@ i A@@ m@@ b@@ ad@@ y , a re@@ sear@@ ch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sity , sho@@ ws that when people wat@@ ch 3@@ 0@@ -@@ second s@@ ound@@ less c@@ li@@ ps of real physi@@ ci@@ an@@ -@@ pati@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the physi@@ ci@@ an &apos;s n@@ ic@@ en@@ ess predic@@ t whether or not that physi@@ ci@@ an will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . R@@ ight ?"
"We are also in@@ flu@@ enc@@ ed by our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ ghts and our feel@@ ings and our physi@@ o@@ logy ."
So what non@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ st . I study pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , and I te@@ ach at a com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive business school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interest@@ ed in power d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
I became esp@@ eci@@ ally interest@@ ed in non@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pre@@ ssi@@ ons of power and dom@@ in@@ ance .
And what are non@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pre@@ ssi@@ ons of power and dom@@ in@@ ance ?
"So in the an@@ ima@@ l k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about exp@@ anding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically op@@ ening up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ ening up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ es@@ sic@@ a T@@ r@@ acy has stu@@ died ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really powerful with us , we t@@ end to make ourselves sm@@ all@@ er . We don &apos;t m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavi@@ or in the cla@@ ss@@ room , and what do I not@@ ice ?"
"When they s@@ it down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ read out ."
"You have other people who are vir@@ tually coll@@ ap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I not@@ ice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more like@@ ly to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ om@@ en feel ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ ally less powerful than men , so this is not surpri@@ sing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A cla@@ ss@@ room , because par@@ tici@@ p@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So business sch@@ o@@ ols have been str@@ ug@@ g@@ ling with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re par@@ tici@@ p@@ ating ."
There &apos;s some evi@@ dence that they do .
"So , for example , we s@@ mi@@ le when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ c@@ ed to s@@ mi@@ le by hol@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ e@@ th like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ dies , but is it also true that our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the powerful ver@@ su@@ s the power@@ less look like ?
"So powerful people t@@ end to be , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ dent , more op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to w@@ in even at g@@ am@@ es of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ris@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to stre@@ ss ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power lead@@ er that &apos;s dom@@ in@@ ant , high on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one , but really stre@@ ss re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this evi@@ dence , both that the body can sh@@ ape the mind , at least at the fac@@ i@@ al level , and also that ro@@ le chan@@ ges can sh@@ ape the mind ."
"So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ ima@@ l level , like this tin@@ y man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation , this tin@@ y inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be st@@ anding or you can be sit@@ ting .
And here are the lo@@ w@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re tou@@ ching your nec@@ k , you &apos;re really prot@@ ec@@ ting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experi@@ ment .
Here &apos;s what we find on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these chan@@ ges ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
"So it see@@ ms that our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als do go@@ ver@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative situ@@ ations , like social thre@@ at situ@@ ations ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being rec@@ or@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is wor@@ se than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led ."
People h@@ ate this .
"We then have these co@@ ders look at these t@@ ap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is . They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the condi@@ tions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ ec@@ h .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the eff@@ ect , or medi@@ ating the eff@@ ect ."
"So I said , fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an imp@@ os@@ tor .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad car ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a car , ro@@ l@@ led se@@ ver@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the car .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had identi@@ fied with being smar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of colle@@ ge , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish colle@@ ge ."
I am an imp@@ os@@ tor .
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feel@@ ing ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , she can fa@@ ke it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it ."
F@@ a@@ ke it ti@@ ll you become it .
D@@ o it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ al@@ ize .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y tw@@ ea@@ ks can le@@ ad to big chan@@ ges .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ w@@ o minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
"D@@ on &apos;t leave that situ@@ ation feel@@ ing like , o@@ h , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .

C@@ re@@ ati@@ vity is the me@@ me@@ -@@ ma@@ ker that pu@@ ts s@@ lo@@ g@@ ans on our t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts and ph@@ ra@@ ses on our li@@ ps .
It &apos;s the pa@@ th@@ fin@@ der that sho@@ ws us a simple ro@@ ad through an imp@@ ene@@ tr@@ able mor@@ al ma@@ ze .
"S@@ ci@@ ence is cle@@ ver , but great cre@@ ati@@ vity is something less know@@ able , more ma@@ gi@@ cal . And now we need that ma@@ gi@@ c ."
This is a time of need .
"O@@ ur climate is chan@@ ging quickly , too quickly ."
And great cre@@ ati@@ vity is needed to do what it does so well : to pro@@ vo@@ ke us to think differ@@ ently with dra@@ ma@@ tic cre@@ ative st@@ ate@@ ments .
T@@ o te@@ mp@@ t us to act differ@@ ently with deli@@ gh@@ t@@ ful cre@@ ative sc@@ r@@ aps .
Here is one such sc@@ ra@@ p from an ini@@ ti@@ ative I &apos;m inv@@ olved in using cre@@ ati@@ vity to insp@@ ire people to be gre@@ en@@ er .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : You know , rather than dri@@ ve today , I &apos;m going to walk ."
"N@@ ar@@ r@@ ator : And so he wal@@ ked , and as he wal@@ ked he saw things ."
S@@ tran@@ ge and wonder@@ ful things he would not o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se have seen .
A de@@ er with an it@@ ch@@ y le@@ g . A fl@@ ying m@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle .
A father and d@@ aughter se@@ par@@ ated from a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle by a my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous w@@ all .
And then he st@@ opp@@ ed . W@@ al@@ king in front of him was her .
The woman who as a child had s@@ ki@@ pp@@ ed with him through fiel@@ ds and bro@@ ken his heart .
"S@@ ure , she had ag@@ ed a little ."
"In fact , she had ag@@ ed a lot ."
But he felt all his old pas@@ sion for her re@@ turn .
"@@ &quot; &quot; F@@ ord , &quot; &quot; he called so@@ f@@ tly . F@@ or that was her name ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t say another word , G@@ u@@ st@@ y , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; I know a t@@ ent next to a car@@ a@@ v@@ an , exactly 3@@ 00 y@@ ar@@ ds from here ."
"@@ Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the t@@ ent . &quot; &quot; F@@ ord und@@ re@@ ssed . She sp@@ read one le@@ g , and then the other ."
"@@ G@@ u@@ st@@ y en@@ ter@@ ed her b@@ ol@@ d@@ ly and made love to her r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic@@ ally while she fil@@ med him , because she was a ke@@ en am@@ ate@@ ur por@@ no@@ grap@@ her ."
The ear@@ th mo@@ ved for both of them .
And they li@@ ved together happ@@ i@@ ly ever after .
And all because he decided to walk that day .
"( Applause ) An@@ dy H@@ ob@@ s@@ ba@@ w@@ m : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the de@@ b@@ ate ."
The mor@@ al im@@ per@@ ative is on the table .
"@@ G@@ re@@ at cre@@ ati@@ vity is needed to take it all , make it simple and shar@@ p ."
T@@ o make it con@@ n@@ ect . T@@ o make it make people want to act .
"So this is a call , a p@@ le@@ a , to the incredi@@ bly tal@@ en@@ ted TED community ."
Let &apos;s get cre@@ ative against climate change .
And let &apos;s do it so@@ on . Thank you .
( Applause )
"B@@ ea@@ u L@@ ot@@ to : So , this ga@@ me is very simple ."
All you have to do is read what you see . R@@ ight ?
"So , I &apos;m going to coun@@ t to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together ."
"O@@ kay , one , two , th@@ ree@@ .@@ Au@@ di@@ ence : C@@ an you read this ?"
"B@@ L : A@@ ma@@ zing . What about this one ? One , two , th@@ ree@@ .@@ Au@@ di@@ ence : You are not read@@ ing this ."
"B@@ L : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three ."
Au@@ di@@ ence : What are you read@@ ing ?
B@@ L : What are you read@@ ing ? There are no words there .
"I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . R@@ ight ?"
"It liter@@ ally says , &quot; &quot; W@@ at ar ou re@@ a in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) R@@ ight ?"
That &apos;s what you should have said . R@@ ight ? Why is this ?
It &apos;s because per@@ cep@@ tion is gr@@ oun@@ ded in our experience .
"@@ R@@ ight ? The brain takes me@@ an@@ ing@@ less information and makes me@@ an@@ ing out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was u@@ se@@ ful to see in the past ."
"A@@ ll right ? Wh@@ ich means , when it comes to per@@ cep@@ tion , we &apos;re all like this f@@ ro@@ g ."
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s gener@@ ating behavi@@ or that &apos;s u@@ se@@ ful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : O@@ w ! O@@ w ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) B@@ L : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit an@@ no@@ yed , right ?"
"But we &apos;re talking about per@@ cep@@ tion here , right ?"
"And per@@ cep@@ tion under@@ p@@ ins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hop@@ es , our dre@@ a@@ ms , the c@@ lo@@ th@@ es we w@@ ear , f@@ all@@ ing in love , everything begin@@ s with per@@ cep@@ tion ."
"Now if per@@ cep@@ tion is gr@@ oun@@ ded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever respon@@ ding ac@@ cor@@ ding to what we &apos;ve done before ."
"But actually , it &apos;s a tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous problem , because how can we ever see differ@@ ently ?"
"Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differ@@ ently , and all new per@@ cep@@ tions beg@@ in in the same way ."
They beg@@ in with a question .
The problem with questions is they create un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"Now , un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ari@@ ly a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a pre@@ dat@@ or , it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
O@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) E@@ ven se@@ a@@ sic@@ k@@ ness is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"@@ R@@ ight ? If you go down b@@ el@@ ow on a bo@@ at , your in@@ ner ear@@ s are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Y@@ our eyes , because it &apos;s moving in regi@@ ster with the bo@@ at , say I &apos;m st@@ anding still ."
"@@ Y@@ our brain cannot de@@ al with the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of that information , and it gets ill ."
"The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous things you can do , because it takes you into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ."
"And yet , the ir@@ on@@ y is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to ste@@ p into that space ."
"So how can we ever do anything new ? Well for@@ tun@@ ately , ev@@ olution has given us an answer , right ?"
And it en@@ ab@@ les us to ad@@ dre@@ ss even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . R@@ ight ?
"It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life beg@@ in , or what ex@@ ten@@ ds be@@ y@@ on@@ d the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really ste@@ pp@@ ing into that space ."
So what is ev@@ olution &apos;s answer to the problem of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . E@@ x@@ per@@ ts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
P@@ l@@ ay is one of the only human en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ ors where un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is actually c@@ ele@@ br@@ ated . Un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is what makes play fu@@ n .
"@@ R@@ ight ? It &apos;s ad@@ ap@@ table to change . R@@ ight ? It op@@ ens pos@@ si@@ bility , and it &apos;s co@@ oper@@ ative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social b@@ on@@ ding , and it &apos;s in@@ tr@@ in@@ sically m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated . What that means is that we play to play . P@@ l@@ ay is its own re@@ ward ."
"Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the ex@@ act same ways of being you need in order to be a good scienti@@ st ."
S@@ ci@@ ence is not defin@@ ed by the me@@ th@@ od sec@@ tion of a p@@ aper .
"It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is cre@@ ative ."
"So if you ad@@ d r@@ ules to play , you have a ga@@ me ."
That &apos;s actually what an experi@@ ment is .
"So ar@@ med with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and exper@@ im@@ ents are play , we asked , can any@@ one become a scienti@@ st ?"
And who better to ask than 25 e@@ igh@@ t@@ - to 1@@ 0@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old children ?
"Because they &apos;re exper@@ ts in play . So I took my be@@ e ar@@ en@@ a down to a small school in D@@ ev@@ on , and the ai@@ m of this was to not just get the kids to see science differ@@ ently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differ@@ ently . R@@ ight ?"
The first ste@@ p was to ask a question .
"Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get fund@@ ing for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a u@@ se@@ ful con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to science , and the teach@@ ers said kids couldn &apos;t do it ."
So we did it any@@ way . R@@ ight ? O@@ f course .
"So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small pr@@ int so you w@@ ouldn &apos;t b@@ other read@@ ing it . P@@ o@@ int is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the b@@ as@@ is of science publi@@ cation the last five to 15 years . R@@ ight ?"
So they were as@@ king questions that were sign@@ i@@ fic@@ ant to exper@@ t scientists .
"Now here , I want to share the st@@ age with someone quite speci@@ al . R@@ ight ?"
"S@@ he was one of the young people who was inv@@ olved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youn@@ gest publi@@ shed scientists in the world . R@@ ight ? She will now , once she comes on@@ to st@@ age , will be the youn@@ gest person to ever speak at TED . R@@ ight ?"
"Now , science and as@@ king questions is about cou@@ ra@@ ge ."
"Now she is the pers@@ on@@ i@@ fi@@ cation of cou@@ ra@@ ge , because she &apos;s going to st@@ and up here and talk to you all ."
"So A@@ my , would you p@@ lease come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So A@@ my &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ es P@@ ro@@ ject , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go a@@ head , A@@ my ."
"A@@ my O &apos;@@ T@@ oo@@ le : Thank you , B@@ ea@@ u . We thought that it was easy to see the l@@ ink between humans and ap@@ es in the way that we think , because we look ali@@ ke ."
"But we wonder@@ ed if there &apos;s a possible l@@ ink with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and be@@ es thought si@@ mil@@ ar , since they see@@ m so different from us ."
So we asked if humans and be@@ es might solve comple@@ x problems in the same way .
"@@ Re@@ ally , we wanted to know if be@@ es can also ad@@ ap@@ t themselves to new situ@@ ations using pre@@ vi@@ ously learned r@@ ules and condi@@ tions . So what if be@@ es can think like us ?"
"Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an in@@ s@@ ect with only one million brain cells ."
"But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because be@@ es , like us , can recogn@@ ize a good flo@@ wer re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the time of day , the light , the w@@ ea@@ ther , or from any ang@@ le they appro@@ ach it from . ( Applause ) B@@ L : So the next ste@@ p was to design an experi@@ ment , which is a ga@@ me . So the kids went off and they design@@ ed this experi@@ ment , and so — well , ga@@ me — and so , A@@ my , can you tell us what the ga@@ me was , and the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le that you set the be@@ es ?"
A@@ O : The pu@@ z@@ z@@ le we came up with was an i@@ f-@@ then ru@@ le .
"We asked the be@@ es to learn not just to go to a certain col@@ or , but to a certain col@@ or flo@@ wer only when it &apos;s in a certain pat@@ ter@@ n ."
"They were only re@@ war@@ ded if they went to the y@@ el@@ low flo@@ w@@ ers if the y@@ el@@ low flo@@ w@@ ers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the bl@@ ue , or if the bl@@ ue flo@@ w@@ ers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the y@@ el@@ low ."
"Now there &apos;s a number of different r@@ ules the be@@ es can learn to solve this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le . The interesting question is , which ?"
"What was really exc@@ iting about this project was we , and B@@ ea@@ u , had no idea whether it would work ."
"It was completely new , and no one had done it before , inclu@@ ding ad@@ ul@@ ts . ( Laughter ) B@@ L : In@@ clu@@ ding the teach@@ ers , and that was really hard for the teach@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s easy for a scienti@@ st to go in and not have a cl@@ ue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the la@@ b , but for a te@@ ac@@ her not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the cre@@ d@@ it goes to D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ k , who was the coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ator on this project . O@@ kay ?"
"So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next ste@@ p is ob@@ serv@@ ation . So here are some of the students doing the ob@@ serv@@ ations . They &apos;re rec@@ or@@ ding the data of where the be@@ es f@@ ly ."
( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ k : So what we &apos;re going to do — S@@ tu@@ dent : 5@@ C .
D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ k : I@@ s she still going up here ? S@@ tu@@ dent : Y@@ eah .
"D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ k : So you keep tr@@ ack of e@@ ach@@ .@@ S@@ tu@@ dent : H@@ en@@ ry , can you help me here ?"
"B@@ L : &quot; &quot; C@@ an you help me , H@@ en@@ ry ? &quot; &quot; What good scienti@@ st says that , right ?"
S@@ tu@@ dent : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
B@@ L : R@@ ight ? So we &apos;ve got our ob@@ serv@@ ations . We &apos;ve got our data .
"They do the simple ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics , a@@ ver@@ ag@@ ing , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next ste@@ p .
So we &apos;re going to wr@@ ite this up and try to sub@@ m@@ it this for publi@@ cation . R@@ ight ? So we have to wr@@ ite it up .
"So we go , of course , to the pu@@ b . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is m@@ ine , o@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a p@@ aper has four different sec@@ tions : an int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion , a me@@ th@@ o@@ ds , a resul@@ ts , a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
"The int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion says , what &apos;s the question and why ?"
"M@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ds , what did you do ? R@@ es@@ ul@@ ts , what was the ob@@ serv@@ ation ?"
"And the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion is , who car@@ es ? R@@ ight ?"
"That &apos;s a science p@@ aper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive , which means that this p@@ aper is wr@@ it@@ ten in ki@@ d@@ speak ."
"It &apos;s not wr@@ it@@ ten by me . It &apos;s wr@@ it@@ ten by A@@ my and the other students in the cla@@ ss . A@@ s a con@@ sequ@@ ence , this science p@@ aper begin@@ s , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce up@@ on a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The resul@@ ts sec@@ tion , it says : &quot; &quot; T@@ ra@@ ining p@@ ha@@ se , the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le ... du@@ h du@@ h du@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ? ( Laughter ) And the me@@ th@@ o@@ ds , it says , &quot; &quot; Th@@ en we put the be@@ es into the fri@@ dge ( and made be@@ e pi@@ e ) , &quot; &quot; s@@ mi@@ le@@ y face . R@@ ight ? ( Laughter ) This is a science p@@ aper . We &apos;re going to try to get it publi@@ shed ."
So here &apos;s the ti@@ tle p@@ age . We have a number of au@@ th@@ ors there .
All the ones in bo@@ ld are e@@ ight to 10 years old .
"The first au@@ th@@ or is B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton P@@ ri@@ mar@@ y S@@ ch@@ ool , because if it were ever re@@ fer@@ enc@@ ed , it would be &quot; &quot; B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individu@@ al . So we sub@@ m@@ it it to a public ac@@ cess jour@@ n@@ al , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id the p@@ aper fa@@ il@@ s our ini@@ ti@@ al qu@@ ality control ch@@ ec@@ ks in se@@ ver@@ al different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it star@@ ts off &quot; &quot; once up@@ on a time , &quot; &quot; the fi@@ gu@@ res are in cra@@ y@@ on , et@@ c . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it re@@ vi@@ e@@ wed . So I s@@ ent it to D@@ ale P@@ ur@@ ves , who is at the N@@ ational A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of S@@ ci@@ ence , one of the lead@@ ing neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most ori@@ gin@@ al science p@@ aper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it cer@@ tain@@ ly de@@ ser@@ ves wi@@ de ex@@ pos@@ ure . &quot;"
"L@@ ar@@ ry M@@ al@@ on@@ ey , exper@@ t in vi@@ sion , says , &quot; &quot; The p@@ aper is ma@@ gn@@ i@@ fic@@ ent ."
The work would be publi@@ sha@@ ble if done by ad@@ ul@@ ts . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We s@@ end it back to the ed@@ it@@ or .
They say no .
"So we asked L@@ ar@@ ry and N@@ at@@ ali@@ e H@@ em@@ pe@@ l to wr@@ ite a comm@@ ent@@ ary situ@@ ating the fin@@ d@@ ings for scientists , right , pu@@ tting in the re@@ fer@@ ences , and we sub@@ m@@ it it to B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters ."
"And there , it was re@@ vi@@ e@@ wed by five in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent re@@ fer@@ e@@ es , and it was publi@@ shed . O@@ kay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it publi@@ shed . ( Laughter ) T@@ y@@ pi@@ cal science , actually , right ? So this makes A@@ my and her friends the youn@@ gest publi@@ shed scientists in the world ."
What was the fe@@ ed@@ back like ?
"Well , it was publi@@ shed two days before Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed 3@@ 0,000 times in the first day , right ?"
"It was the E@@ d@@ it@@ ors &apos; Ch@@ o@@ ice in S@@ ci@@ ence , which is a top science ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine ."
It &apos;s fore@@ ver f@@ ree@@ ly acc@@ es@@ sible by B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters .
It &apos;s the only p@@ aper that will ever be f@@ ree@@ ly acc@@ es@@ sible by this jour@@ n@@ al .
"L@@ ast year , it was the secon@@ d-@@ most do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed p@@ aper by B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters , and the fe@@ ed@@ back from not just scientists and teach@@ ers but the public as well ."
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; &quot; I have read &apos; B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ es &apos; rec@@ ently . I don &apos;t have words to expla@@ in exactly how I am feel@@ ing right now .
"What you guys have done is real , true and amazing ."
"C@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , inter@@ est , inno@@ c@@ ence and z@@ e@@ al are the most ba@@ si@@ c and most important things to do science ."
Wh@@ o else can have these qu@@ ali@@ ties more than children ?
P@@ lease con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to con@@ clu@@ de with a physi@@ cal me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
"C@@ an I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) O@@ h y@@ eah , y@@ eah , y@@ eah , come on . Y@@ eah y@@ eah . O@@ kay ."
"Now , science is about taking ris@@ ks , so this is an incredi@@ ble risk , right ? ( Laughter ) F@@ or me , not for him . R@@ ight ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?"
"S@@ hi@@ m@@ on S@@ cho@@ c@@ ken : R@@ ight , but I like myself ."
B@@ L : This is the ep@@ it@@ ome of technology . R@@ ight . O@@ kay .
"Now ... ( Laughter ) O@@ kay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion , right ?"
"You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me cl@@ app@@ ing . All right ?"
"( C@@ l@@ app@@ ing ) ( C@@ l@@ app@@ ing ) O@@ kay , how about if everyone over there sh@@ ou@@ ts . One , two , three ?"
"A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) B@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time ."
E@@ very@@ one over there sh@@ out . ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) Wh@@ ere &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
"@@ R@@ ight ? We nor@@ m@@ ally walk through life respon@@ ding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to ste@@ p into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty . Wh@@ en he op@@ en@@ ed his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way ."
"That &apos;s what science off@@ ers us . It off@@ ers the pos@@ si@@ bility to ste@@ p on un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty through the process of play , right ?"
"Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a vo@@ ice and en@@ ab@@ ling to ex@@ pre@@ ss that vo@@ ice , so I &apos;ve asked A@@ my to be the last vo@@ ice in this sh@@ ort story ."
"So , A@@ my ?"
"A@@ O : This project was really exc@@ iting for me , because it b@@ rought the process of disco@@ very to life , and it sho@@ wed me that any@@ one , and I mean any@@ one , has the pot@@ ential to disco@@ ver something new , and that a small question can le@@ ad into a big disco@@ very ."
Ch@@ an@@ ging the way a person thin@@ ks about something can be easy or hard . It all dep@@ ends on the way the person fe@@ els about change .
"But chan@@ ging the way I thought about science was surpri@@ sing@@ ly easy . O@@ n@@ ce we pla@@ yed the g@@ am@@ es and then started to think about the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a bor@@ ing sub@@ ject , and that any@@ one can disco@@ ver something new ."
"You just need an opport@@ unity . My opport@@ unity came in the form of B@@ ea@@ u , and the B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ e P@@ ro@@ ject ."
Thank y@@ ou@@ .@@ B@@ L : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the big@@ gest problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tical En@@ viron@@ m@@ ent@@ ali@@ st &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good cho@@ ice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
"And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out p@@ en and p@@ aper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that ."
So get out your p@@ en and p@@ aper .
"B@@ ot@@ to@@ m line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world ."
I &apos;m just going to li@@ st some of them .
There are 8@@ 00 million people star@@ ving .
There &apos;s a billion people without cle@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water .
T@@ w@@ o billion people without s@@ an@@ it@@ ation .
There are se@@ ver@@ al million people d@@ ying of H@@ I@@ V and A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
The li@@ sts go on and on .
There &apos;s two b@@ illions of people who will be se@@ ver@@ ely aff@@ ected by climate change — so on .
"There are many , many problems out there ."
"In an ide@@ al world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t ."
We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
"And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the econom@@ y se@@ s@@ sion — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start as@@ king ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?"
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
"If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?"
"We identi@@ fied 10 of the big@@ gest challen@@ ges in the world , and I will just bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly read them : climate change , communi@@ ca@@ ble dise@@ ases , conf@@ lic@@ ts , education , fin@@ anci@@ al inst@@ ability , govern@@ ance and cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion , mal@@ n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion and h@@ un@@ ger , population mi@@ gra@@ tion , s@@ an@@ it@@ ation and water , and sub@@ si@@ dies and tra@@ de bar@@ ri@@ ers ."
We believe that these in many ways en@@ comp@@ as@@ s the big@@ gest problems in the world .
"The obvi@@ ous question would be to ask , what do you think are the big@@ gest things ?"
Wh@@ ere should we start on sol@@ ving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in D@@ a@@ vo@@ s in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
"But of course , there &apos;s a problem in as@@ king people to foc@@ us on problems ."
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
S@@ u@@ re@@ ly the big@@ gest problem we have in the world is that we all di@@ e .
"But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?"
"So the point is not to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze problems , but the point is to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze solu@@ tions to problems ."
And that would be — of course that gets a little more comp@@ li@@ cated .
T@@ o climate change that would be like K@@ y@@ ot@@ o .
"T@@ o communi@@ ca@@ ble dise@@ ases , it might be health cl@@ in@@ ics or m@@ os@@ qu@@ i@@ to ne@@ ts ."
"T@@ o conf@@ lic@@ ts , it would be U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s pe@@ ace@@ ke@@ ep@@ ing for@@ ces , and so on ."
"The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 secon@@ ds — and I know this is in a sense an imp@@ os@@ sible t@@ ask — wr@@ ite down what you think is probably some of the top pri@@ ori@@ ties ."
"And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where econom@@ ics gets evi@@ l — to put down what are the things we should not do , first ."
What should be at the bot@@ to@@ m of the li@@ st ?
"P@@ lease , just take 30 secon@@ ds , perhaps talk to your ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or , and just figure out what should be the top pri@@ ori@@ ties and the bot@@ to@@ m pri@@ ori@@ ties of the solu@@ tions that we have to the world &apos;s big@@ gest issu@@ es ."
"The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 1@@ 8 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al amount of my time , right ?"
"I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did ."
"And I also str@@ on@@ g@@ ly enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions af@@ ter@@ wards , to think about , how do we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze ?"
"O@@ f course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a li@@ st never done before ?"
And one reason is that pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ation is incredi@@ bly un@@ com@@ for@@ table .
N@@ o@@ body wan@@ ts to do this .
"O@@ f course , every organ@@ ization would love to be on the top of such a li@@ st ."
But every organ@@ ization would also h@@ ate to be not on the top of the li@@ st .
"And since there are many more not@@ -@@ num@@ ber@@ -@@ one sp@@ ots on the li@@ st than there is number ones , it makes per@@ f@@ ect sense not to want to do such a li@@ st ."
"We &apos;ve had the U.@@ N@@ . for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundam@@ ental li@@ st of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?"
"So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing — any deci@@ sion is a pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ation , so of course we are still pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing , if only imp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly — and that &apos;s un@@ like@@ ly to be as good as if we actually did the pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ation , and went in and tal@@ ked about it ."
"So what I &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situ@@ ation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of cho@@ ices ."
"There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the pri@@ ces , n@@ or the si@@ z@@ es ."
We have not had an idea .
"I@@ ma@@ gine going into a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant and getting this big men@@ u c@@ ard , but you have no idea what the pri@@ ce is ."
"You know , you have a p@@ iz@@ z@@ a ; you &apos;ve no idea what the pri@@ ce is ."
"It could be at one dol@@ lar ; it could be 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"It could be a fa@@ mil@@ y-@@ size p@@ iz@@ z@@ a ; it could be a very individu@@ al@@ -@@ size p@@ iz@@ z@@ a , right ?"
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s is really trying to do — to try to put pri@@ ces on these issu@@ es .
"And so basically , this has been the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s &apos; process ."
"We got 30 of the world &apos;s best econom@@ i@@ sts , three in each are@@ a ."
So we have three of world &apos;s top econom@@ i@@ sts wr@@ ite about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the b@@ ene@@ f@@ it of that ?
L@@ i@@ ke@@ wi@@ se in communi@@ ca@@ ble dise@@ ases .
"Th@@ ree of the world &apos;s top exper@@ ts saying , what can we do ?"
What would be the pri@@ ce ?
"What should we do about it , and what will be the out@@ come ?"
And so on .
"Th@@ en we had some of the world &apos;s top econom@@ i@@ sts , e@@ ight of the world &apos;s top econom@@ i@@ sts , inclu@@ ding three N@@ o@@ be@@ l L@@ au@@ re@@ ates , me@@ et in C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en in M@@ ay 200@@ 4 ."
We called them the &quot; &quot; dre@@ am team . &quot; &quot; The C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sity pre@@ f@@ ects decided to call them the Re@@ al M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d of econom@@ ics .
"That works very well in Eu@@ rop@@ e , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here ."
And what they basically did was come out with a pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ed li@@ st .
"And then you ask , why econom@@ i@@ sts ?"
"And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question ."
"The point is , of course , if you want to know about mal@@ ari@@ a , you ask a mal@@ ari@@ a exper@@ t ."
"If you want to know about climate , you ask a c@@ li@@ mat@@ o@@ logi@@ st ."
"But if you want to know which of the two you should de@@ al with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do ."
That is what econom@@ i@@ sts do .
They pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze .
"They make that in some ways dis@@ gu@@ sting t@@ ask of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do af@@ ter@@ wards ?"
"So this is the li@@ st , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you ."
"O@@ f course , you can also see it on the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on ."
"They basically came up with a li@@ st where they said there were bad pro@@ jects — basically , pro@@ jects where if you inve@@ st a dol@@ lar , you get less than a dol@@ lar back ."
"Th@@ en there &apos;s fa@@ ir pro@@ jects , good pro@@ jects and very good pro@@ jects ."
"And of course , it &apos;s the very good pro@@ jects we should start doing ."
I &apos;m going to go from b@@ ack@@ wards so that we end up with the best pro@@ jects .
These were the bad pro@@ jects .
A@@ s you might see the bot@@ to@@ m of the li@@ st was climate change .
"This off@@ ends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t come back , either ."
"And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really cu@@ ri@@ ous ."
Why is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with on the li@@ st that you wr@@ ote down .
The reason why they came up with saying that K@@ y@@ ot@@ o — or doing something more than K@@ y@@ ot@@ o — is a bad de@@ al is simply because it &apos;s very in@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent .
It &apos;s not saying that global war@@ m@@ ing is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
"But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost ."
"What they basically show us , the a@@ verage of all m@@ ac@@ ro@@ econom@@ ic mo@@ d@@ els , is that K@@ y@@ ot@@ o , if everyone ag@@ re@@ ed , would cost about 1@@ 50 billion dollars a year ."
That &apos;s a sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al amount of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the global develop@@ ment a@@ id that we give the Th@@ ird Wor@@ ld every year .
Y@@ et it would do very little good .
All mo@@ d@@ els show it will pos@@ t@@ p@@ one war@@ m@@ ing for about six years in 2@@ 100 .
So the guy in B@@ ang@@ la@@ de@@ sh who gets a f@@ loo@@ d in 2@@ 100 can wa@@ it until 2@@ 1@@ 0@@ 6 .
"Wh@@ ich is a little good , but not very much good ."
"So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good ."
"And just to give you a sense of re@@ fer@@ ence , the U.@@ N@@ . actually es@@ tim@@ ate that for half that amount , for about 7@@ 5 billion dollars a year , we could solve all maj@@ or ba@@ si@@ c problems in the world ."
"We could give cle@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water , s@@ an@@ it@@ ation , ba@@ si@@ c heal@@ th@@ care and education to every single human being on the planet ."
"So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend tw@@ ice the amount on doing very little good ?"
O@@ r half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it be@@ comes a bad project .
"It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we w@@ ouldn &apos;t want to do it ."
"But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first pri@@ or@@ ity ."
"The fa@@ ir pro@@ jects — not@@ ice I &apos;m not going to com@@ ment on all these — but communi@@ ca@@ ble dise@@ ases , scale of ba@@ si@@ c health serv@@ ices — just made it , simply because , y@@ es , scale of ba@@ si@@ c health serv@@ ices is a great thing ."
"It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very cos@@ tly ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , what it t@@ ells us is su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly we start thinking about both si@@ des of the equ@@ ation ."
"If you look at the good pro@@ jects , a lot of s@@ an@@ it@@ ation and water pro@@ jects came in ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , s@@ an@@ it@@ ation and water is incredi@@ bly important , but it also cos@@ ts a lot of inf@@ ra@@ structure ."
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four pri@@ ori@@ ties which should be at least the first ones that we de@@ al with when we talk about how we should de@@ al with the problems in the world .
The f@@ our@@ th best problem is mal@@ ari@@ a — de@@ al@@ ing with mal@@ ari@@ a .
The in@@ ci@@ dence of mal@@ ari@@ a is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get inf@@ ected every year .
It might even cost up to@@ wards a per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge point of G@@ D@@ P every year for aff@@ ected n@@ ations .
"If we inve@@ sted about 1@@ 3 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that in@@ ci@@ dence down to half ."
"We could a@@ vo@@ id about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 people d@@ ying , but perhaps more import@@ antly , we could a@@ vo@@ id about a &#91; million &#93; people getting inf@@ ected every year ."
"We would sign@@ i@@ fic@@ antly incre@@ ase their ability to de@@ al with many of the other problems that they have to de@@ al with — of course , in the long run , also to de@@ al with global war@@ m@@ ing ."
This third best one was free tra@@ de .
"B@@ a@@ sically , the model sho@@ wed that if we could get free tra@@ de , and esp@@ eci@@ ally c@@ ut sub@@ si@@ dies in the U.@@ S@@ . and Eu@@ rop@@ e , we could basically en@@ li@@ ven the global econom@@ y to an a@@ st@@ oun@@ ding number of about 2@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 billion dollars a year , half of which would acc@@ ru@@ e to the Th@@ ird Wor@@ ld ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , the point is to say that we could actually pul@@ l two to three hund@@ red million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty , very ra@@ dic@@ ally fa@@ st , in about two to five years ."
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to foc@@ us on mal@@ n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion .
"N@@ ot just mal@@ n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion in gener@@ al , but there &apos;s a very ch@@ ea@@ p way of de@@ al@@ ing with mal@@ n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion , na@@ me@@ ly , the l@@ ack of mic@@ ron@@ u@@ tri@@ ents ."
"B@@ a@@ sically , about half of the world &apos;s population is l@@ ac@@ king in ir@@ on , z@@ in@@ c , i@@ o@@ d@@ ine and v@@ it@@ am@@ in A@@ ."
"If we inve@@ st about 12 billion dollars , we could make a se@@ v@@ ere in@@ ro@@ ad into that problem ."
That would be the second best inve@@ st@@ ment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to foc@@ us on H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
"B@@ a@@ sically , if we inve@@ st 2@@ 7 billion dollars over the next e@@ ight years , we could a@@ vo@@ id 2@@ 8 new million ca@@ ses of H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , what this does and what it foc@@ uses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can de@@ al with H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S ."
One is tre@@ at@@ ment ; the other one is pre@@ ven@@ tion .
"And again , in an ide@@ al world , we would do both ."
"But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we inve@@ st first ."
"And tre@@ at@@ ment is much , much more exp@@ en@@ sive than pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"So basically , what this foc@@ uses on is saying , we can do a lot more by inve@@ sting in pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"B@@ a@@ sically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in tre@@ at@@ ment , and 10 times as much good in pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"So again , what we foc@@ us on is pre@@ ven@@ tion rather than tre@@ at@@ ment , at first r@@ ate ."
What this really does is that it makes us think about our pri@@ ori@@ ties .
"I &apos;d like to have you look at your pri@@ or@@ ity li@@ st and say , did you get it right ?"
O@@ r did you get close to what we came up with here ?
"Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again ."
"I find a lot of people find it very , very un@@ like@@ ly that we should do that ."
"We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem ."
"But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems ."
There are many problems out there in the world .
"And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually foc@@ us on problems , that we foc@@ us on the right ones ."
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
"And I think , actually — Th@@ om@@ as S@@ ch@@ elling , one of the par@@ tici@@ p@@ ants in the dre@@ am team , he put it very , very well ."
"One of things that people for@@ get , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change imp@@ ac@@ ts will be , people will be much , much ri@@ ch@@ er ."
E@@ ven the most pe@@ ssi@@ mi@@ stic imp@@ act sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os of the U.@@ N@@ .
es@@ tim@@ ate that the a@@ verage person in the develop@@ ing world in 2@@ 100 will be about as ri@@ ch as we are today .
"M@@ uch more like@@ ly , they will be two to four times ri@@ ch@@ er than we are ."
"And of course , we &apos;ll be even ri@@ ch@@ er than that ."
"But the point is to say , when we talk about sa@@ ving people , or help@@ ing people in B@@ ang@@ la@@ de@@ sh in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor B@@ ang@@ la@@ de@@ sh@@ i ."
We &apos;re actually talking about a fa@@ ir@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ ut@@ ch guy .
"And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money help@@ ing a little , 100 years from now , a fa@@ ir@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ ut@@ ch guy ?"
"O@@ r do we want to help real poor people , right now , in B@@ ang@@ la@@ de@@ sh , who really need the help , and wh@@ om we can help very , very che@@ ap@@ ly ?"
"O@@ r as S@@ ch@@ elling put it , imagine if you were a ri@@ ch — as you will be — a ri@@ ch Chin@@ ese , a ri@@ ch B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ an , a ri@@ ch Con@@ go@@ le@@ se , in 2@@ 100 , thinking back on 200@@ 5 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How o@@ d@@ d that they car@@ ed so much about help@@ ing me a little bit through climate change , and car@@ ed so fa@@ ir@@ ly little about help@@ ing my gr@@ and@@ father and my great gr@@ and@@ father , wh@@ om they could have help@@ ed so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our pri@@ ori@@ ties stra@@ ight ."
E@@ ven if it doesn &apos;t ac@@ cor@@ d to the t@@ y@@ pi@@ cal way we see this problem .
"O@@ f course , that &apos;s ma@@ in@@ ly because climate change has good pic@@ tures ."
"We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The D@@ ay A@@ f@@ ter T@@ om@@ or@@ row &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?"
"It &apos;s a good fil@@ m in the sense that I cer@@ tain@@ ly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t exp@@ ect E@@ m@@ mer@@ ich to ca@@ st B@@ ra@@ d P@@ it@@ t in his next mo@@ vi@@ e di@@ g@@ ging l@@ at@@ r@@ ines in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a mo@@ vi@@ e ."
"So in many ways , I think of the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s and the whole di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion of pri@@ ori@@ ties as a de@@ f@@ en@@ se for bor@@ ing problems ."
T@@ o make sure that we real@@ ize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
"It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media atten@@ tion , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good ."
"The other ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tions , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m some@@ how — or we are some@@ how — pos@@ iting a f@@ al@@ se cho@@ ice ."
"O@@ f course , we should do all things , in an ide@@ al world — I would cer@@ tain@@ ly ag@@ ree ."
"I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t ."
"In 19@@ 70 , the develop@@ ed world decided we were going to spend tw@@ ice as much as we did , right now , than in 19@@ 70 , on the develop@@ ing world ."
S@@ ince then our a@@ id has hal@@ ved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the p@@ ath of su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly sol@@ ving all big problems .
"L@@ i@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , people are also saying , but what about the I@@ ra@@ q war ?"
"You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?"
I &apos;m all for that .
"If any one of you guys can talk B@@ us@@ h into doing that , that &apos;s f@@ ine ."
"But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?"
So the real issu@@ e here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right pri@@ ori@@ ties .
"I should just men@@ tion bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly , is this really the right li@@ st that we got out ?"
"You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best econom@@ i@@ sts , you in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably end up as@@ king old , wh@@ ite American men ."
"And they &apos;re not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world ."
So we actually inv@@ ited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
"The only two requ@@ i@@ re@@ ments were that they were stud@@ ying at the univer@@ sity , and they sp@@ o@@ ke Eng@@ lish ."
"The maj@@ or@@ ity of them were , first , from develop@@ ing countries ."
"They had all the same materi@@ al but they could go va@@ st@@ ly outside the sc@@ op@@ e of di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion , and they cer@@ tain@@ ly did , to come up with their own li@@ sts ."
And the surpri@@ sing thing was that the li@@ st was very si@@ mil@@ ar — with mal@@ n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion and dise@@ ases at the top and climate change at the bot@@ to@@ m .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
"There &apos;s been many other se@@ min@@ ar@@ s and univer@@ sity students , and different things ."
They all come out with very much the same li@@ st .
"And that gi@@ ves me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a p@@ ath a@@ head to get us to start thinking about pri@@ ori@@ ties , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?"
"O@@ f course , in an ide@@ al world , again we &apos;d love to do everything ."
"But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?"
I see the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s as a process .
"We did it in 200@@ 4 , and we hope to as@@ se@@ m@@ ble many more people , getting much better information for 200@@ 8 , 20@@ 12 ."
Ma@@ p out the right p@@ ath for the world — but also to start thinking about political tri@@ age .
"T@@ o start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an en@@ or@@ mous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; A@@ t the end of the day , you can di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion of how we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze these , but we have to be hon@@ est and f@@ r@@ ank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do ."
"If we wor@@ ry too much about some things , we end by not wor@@ r@@ ying about other things ."
"So I hope this will help us make better pri@@ ori@@ ties , and think about how we better work for the world ."
Thank you .
The year is 18@@ 00 .
A cu@@ ri@@ ous little inv@@ en@@ tion is being tal@@ ked about .
It &apos;s called a mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e .
What it allo@@ ws you to do is see tin@@ y little li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms that are in@@ vi@@ sible to the na@@ ked ey@@ e .
S@@ o@@ on comes the medi@@ cal disco@@ very that many of these li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms are actually ca@@ uses of ter@@ ri@@ ble human dise@@ ases .
"I@@ ma@@ gine what happened to the society when they realized that an Eng@@ lish mo@@ m in her te@@ ac@@ up actually was dr@@ in@@ king a mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p , not very far from here . This is from L@@ on@@ don ."
F@@ ast for@@ ward 200 years .
"We still have this mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p around , and it &apos;s taken h@@ old in the develop@@ ing countries around the t@@ ro@@ pi@@ cal b@@ el@@ t ."
"@@ J@@ ust for mal@@ ari@@ a itself , there are a million de@@ a@@ ths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be te@@ sted because they are at risk for different species of mal@@ ari@@ al inf@@ ec@@ tions ."
Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these mon@@ st@@ ers .
"You take a sta@@ in , like ac@@ ri@@ d@@ ine or@@ an@@ ge or a flu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent sta@@ in or G@@ i@@ em@@ s@@ a , and a mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e , and you look at them ."
They all have fac@@ es .
"Wh@@ y is that so , that A@@ le@@ x in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , F@@ ati@@ m@@ a in B@@ ang@@ la@@ de@@ sh , N@@ a@@ v@@ j@@ oo@@ t in M@@ um@@ ba@@ i , and J@@ u@@ li@@ e and M@@ ary in U@@ g@@ and@@ a still wa@@ it months to be able to di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose why they are si@@ ck ?"
And that &apos;s pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly because sc@@ al@@ ability of the di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tics is completely out of re@@ ach .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem lies with the mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e itself .
"E@@ ven though the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of mo@@ der@@ n science , research mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es are not design@@ ed for field te@@ sting ."
N@@ either were they first design@@ ed for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tics at all .
"They are hea@@ v@@ y , b@@ ul@@ k@@ y , really hard to ma@@ in@@ tain , and cost a lot of money ."
This picture is Ma@@ h@@ at@@ m@@ a G@@ and@@ h@@ i in the &apos; 4@@ 0s using the ex@@ act same se@@ tu@@ p that we actually use today for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing T@@ .@@ B@@ . in his a@@ sh@@ ra@@ m in S@@ ev@@ ag@@ ra@@ m in In@@ dia .
"T@@ w@@ o of my students , J@@ i@@ m and J@@ am@@ es , tra@@ vel@@ ed around In@@ dia and T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , star@@ ting to think about this problem a lot ."
We saw all kinds of d@@ on@@ ated equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment .
We saw fun@@ g@@ us gro@@ wing on mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e l@@ en@@ ses .
And we saw people who had a fun@@ c@@ tional mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
What gre@@ w out of that work and that tri@@ p was actually the idea of what we call F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es .
So what is a F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ e ?
"A F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ e is a completely fun@@ c@@ tional mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e , a pl@@ at@@ form for flu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ence , bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ field , pol@@ ar@@ ization , pro@@ j@@ ection , all kinds of adv@@ anc@@ ed mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ y built pu@@ re@@ ly by fol@@ ding p@@ aper ."
"So , now you think , how is that possible ?"
"I &apos;m going to show you some exa@@ mp@@ les here , and we will run through some of them ."
It star@@ ts with a single sh@@ e@@ et of p@@ aper .
What you see here is all the possible comp@@ on@@ ents to build a fun@@ c@@ tional bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ field and flu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ence mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e .
"So , there are three st@@ ages : There is the op@@ tical st@@ age , the ill@@ um@@ in@@ ation st@@ age and the ma@@ sk@@ -@@ hol@@ ding st@@ age ."
And there are mic@@ r@@ o op@@ tics at the bot@@ to@@ m that &apos;s actually em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the p@@ aper itself .
"What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are pla@@ ying like a to@@ y , which it is , I ta@@ b it off , and I brea@@ k it off ."
This p@@ aper has no in@@ struc@@ tions and no langu@@ ages .
"There is a co@@ de , a col@@ or co@@ de em@@ be@@ d@@ ded , that t@@ ells you exactly how to fo@@ ld that speci@@ fic mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e ."
"When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ali@@ ties of a st@@ and@@ ard mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e , just like an X@@ Y st@@ age , a place where a sa@@ mple sli@@ de could go , for example right here ."
"We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the st@@ and@@ ard that &apos;s been op@@ ti@@ mi@@ z@@ ed for over the years , and many health wor@@ kers are actually used to this ."
"So this is what chan@@ ges , but the st@@ and@@ ard sta@@ ins all re@@ ma@@ in the same for many different dise@@ ases ."
You po@@ p this in .
"There is an X@@ Y st@@ age , and then there is a foc@@ using st@@ age , which is a f@@ le@@ x@@ ure m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism that &apos;s built in p@@ aper itself that allo@@ ws us to move and foc@@ us the l@@ en@@ ses by mic@@ r@@ on ste@@ ps ."
"So what &apos;s really interesting about this ob@@ ject , and my students h@@ ate when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this any@@ way , is these are ru@@ g@@ ged dev@@ ices ."
I can turn it on and th@@ row it on the flo@@ or and really try to st@@ om@@ p on it .
"And they last , even though they &apos;re design@@ ed from a very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble materi@@ al , like p@@ aper ."
"A@@ no@@ ther fu@@ n fact is , this is what we actually s@@ end out there as a st@@ and@@ ard di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic too@@ l , but here in this en@@ vel@@ op@@ e I have 30 different fol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es of different con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations all in a single fol@@ der ."
And I &apos;m going to pic@@ k one r@@ and@@ om@@ ly .
"This one , it turns out , is actually design@@ ed speci@@ fic@@ ally for mal@@ ari@@ a , because it has the flu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent fil@@ ters built speci@@ fic@@ ally for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing mal@@ ari@@ a ."
So the idea of very speci@@ fic di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es comes out of this .
"So up ti@@ ll now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these se@@ tu@@ ps ."
"So what I would like to do is , if we could di@@ m the li@@ ghts , p@@ lease , it turns out fol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es are also pro@@ j@@ ection mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es ."
"I have these two mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the w@@ all — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see ."
"What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ sec@@ tion of a comp@@ ound ey@@ e , and when I &apos;m going to z@@ oo@@ m in clos@@ er , right there , I am going through the z@@ -@@ a@@ x@@ is ."
You actually see how the l@@ en@@ ses are c@@ ut together in the c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ sec@@ tion pat@@ ter@@ n .
"A@@ no@@ ther example , one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite in@@ s@@ ects , I love to h@@ ate this one , is a m@@ os@@ qu@@ i@@ to , and you &apos;re seeing the an@@ ten@@ n@@ a of a cu@@ le@@ x pi@@ pi@@ ens ."
R@@ ight there .
All from the simple se@@ tu@@ p that I actually descri@@ bed .
So my wi@@ fe has been field te@@ sting some of our mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es by wa@@ shing my c@@ lo@@ th@@ es wh@@ en@@ ever I for@@ get them in the dr@@ y@@ er .
"So it turns out they &apos;re wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just flu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this ."
This also sho@@ ws you how the pro@@ j@@ ection sc@@ op@@ e works .
You get to see the be@@ am the way it &apos;s pro@@ j@@ ected and b@@ ent .
C@@ an we get the li@@ ghts back on again ?
"So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time , in terms of how much it cos@@ ts for us to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture , the big@@ gest idea was ro@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ ro@@ ll man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , so we built this out of 50 c@@ ents of parts and cos@@ ts ."
"( Applause ) And what this allo@@ ws us to do is to think about a new par@@ a@@ di@@ g@@ m in mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ y , which we call u@@ se@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ th@@ row mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ y ."
I &apos;m going to give you a quic@@ k s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some of the parts that go in .
Here is a sh@@ e@@ et of p@@ aper .
This is when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A@@ 4 sh@@ e@@ et of p@@ aper .
These are the three st@@ ages that you actually see .
"And the op@@ tical comp@@ on@@ ents , if you look at the in@@ set up on the right , we had to figure out a way to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture l@@ en@@ ses in p@@ aper itself at really high throu@@ gh@@ pu@@ ts , so it uses a process of self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ bly and sur@@ face ten@@ sion to build ach@@ r@@ om@@ ati@@ c l@@ en@@ ses in the p@@ aper itself ."
So that &apos;s where the l@@ en@@ ses go .
There are some light sources .
"And ess@@ enti@@ ally , in the end , all the parts line up because of ori@@ g@@ am@@ i , because of the fact that ori@@ g@@ am@@ i allo@@ ws us mic@@ ron@@ -@@ scale pre@@ ci@@ sion of op@@ tical ali@@ gn@@ ment ."
"So even though this looks like a simple to@@ y , the as@@ p@@ ects of engine@@ ering that go in something like this are fa@@ ir@@ ly s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ cated ."
"So here is another obvi@@ ous thing that we would do , t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally , if I was going to show that these mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es are ro@@ b@@ ust , is go to the third flo@@ or and dro@@ p it from the flo@@ or itself ."
"There it is , and it survi@@ ves ."
"So for us , the next ste@@ p actually is really fin@@ i@@ shing our field tri@@ als ."
We are star@@ ting at the end of the su@@ mm@@ er .
We are at a st@@ age where we &apos;ll be making thousands of mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es .
That would be the first time where we would be doing field tri@@ als with the high@@ est den@@ sity of mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es ever at a given place .
"We &apos;ve started coll@@ ec@@ ting data for mal@@ ari@@ a , C@@ ha@@ g@@ as disease and gi@@ ar@@ dia from patients themselves ."
And I want to leave you with this picture .
"I had not an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated this before , but a really interesting l@@ ink between h@@ and@@ s@@ -@@ on science education and global health ."
What are the to@@ ols that we &apos;re actually provi@@ ding the kids who are going to fi@@ ght this mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p for tom@@ or@@ row ?
I would love for them to be able to just pr@@ int out a F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ e and car@@ ry them around in their po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts .
Thank you .

O@@ ur world has many super@@ her@@ o@@ es .
But they have the wor@@ st of all super@@ po@@ w@@ ers : in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility .
"For example , the ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res , wor@@ kers who coll@@ ect rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able materi@@ als for a living ."
"C@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res e@@ mer@@ ged from social in@@ equ@@ ality , u@@ ne@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , and the ab@@ und@@ ance of so@@ li@@ d wa@@ st@@ e from the de@@ f@@ ici@@ enc@@ y of the wa@@ st@@ e coll@@ ection system ."
"C@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res provi@@ de a hea@@ v@@ y , hon@@ est and ess@@ ential work that b@@ ene@@ f@@ its the entire population . But they are not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged for it ."
"H@@ ere in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , they coll@@ ect 9@@ 0 percent of all the wa@@ st@@ e that &apos;s actually rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
"M@@ ost of the ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res work in@@ dep@@ end@@ ently , pic@@ king wa@@ st@@ e from the st@@ ree@@ ts and sel@@ ling to j@@ un@@ k y@@ ar@@ ds at very low pri@@ ces ."
"They may coll@@ ect over 3@@ 00 ki@@ lo@@ s in their ba@@ gs , sh@@ opp@@ ing car@@ ts , b@@ ic@@ y@@ cl@@ es and car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as ."
"C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are car@@ ts built from w@@ ood or me@@ t@@ al and found in se@@ ver@@ al st@@ ree@@ ts in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , much like gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i and stre@@ et art ."
And this is how I first met these mar@@ gin@@ al@@ ized super@@ her@@ o@@ es .
"I am a gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i arti@@ st and acti@@ vi@@ st and my art is social , environ@@ mental and political in nature ."
"In 200@@ 7 , I took my work be@@ y@@ on@@ d w@@ all@@ s and on@@ to the car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , as a new ur@@ b@@ an supp@@ ort for my messa@@ ge ."
"But at this time , giving vo@@ ice to the ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res ."
"B@@ y ad@@ ding art and hum@@ or to the cause , it became more appe@@ al@@ ing , which help@@ ed call atten@@ tion to the ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res and im@@ pro@@ ve their self-@@ e@@ ste@@ e@@ m ."
"And also , they are fa@@ mous now on the st@@ ree@@ ts , on ma@@ ss media and social ."
"So , the thing is , I pl@@ un@@ ged into this universe and have not st@@ opp@@ ed working since ."
I have pa@@ in@@ ted over 200 car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as in many cities and have been inv@@ ited to do ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions and tri@@ ps wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de .
"And then I realized that ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res , in their in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility , are not ex@@ cl@@ usi@@ ve to B@@ ra@@ z@@ il ."
"I met them in Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ in@@ a , C@@ hi@@ le , B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ a , S@@ outh Africa , T@@ ur@@ key and even in develop@@ ed countries such as the United States and J@@ ap@@ an ."
And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people jo@@ in the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
"And then , I created a coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative move@@ ment called P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a — ( Laughter ) — which is a large c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ fund@@ ed ev@@ ent ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
So P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a is a large c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ fund@@ ed ev@@ ent to help ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res and their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
"C@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res are as@@ sist@@ ed by w@@ ell@@ -@@ being prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als and heal@@ th@@ care , like physi@@ ci@@ ans , d@@ enti@@ sts , po@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ sts , ha@@ ir st@@ y@@ li@@ sts , ma@@ s@@ sa@@ ge ther@@ ap@@ i@@ sts and much more ."
"But also , they also re@@ cei@@ ve sa@@ fe@@ ty sh@@ ir@@ ts , g@@ lo@@ ves , ra@@ in@@ co@@ ats and ey@@ e@@ g@@ la@@ ss@@ es to see in high@@ -@@ defin@@ ition the city , while their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are r@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ ated by our incredi@@ ble v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers ."
"And then they re@@ cei@@ ve sa@@ fe@@ ty it@@ e@@ ms , too : re@@ fl@@ ective t@@ ap@@ es , hor@@ ns and m@@ ir@@ r@@ ors ."
"Th@@ en , finally , pa@@ in@@ ted by a stre@@ et arti@@ st and become part of part of this huge , amazing mo@@ bi@@ le art ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion ."
"P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a took to the st@@ ree@@ ts of S@@ ã@@ o P@@ a@@ ul@@ o , R@@ i@@ o de J@@ an@@ e@@ ir@@ o and C@@ u@@ ri@@ ti@@ b@@ a ."
"But to me@@ et the de@@ m@@ and in other cities , inclu@@ ding outside of B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , we have created P@@ imp@@ x , which is insp@@ i@@ red by TE@@ D@@ x , and it &apos;s a simp@@ li@@ fied , do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself , c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ fund@@ ed e@@ di@@ tion of P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a ."
So now everybody can jo@@ in .
"In two years , over 1@@ 70 ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res , 8@@ 00 v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and 200 stre@@ et arti@@ sts and more than 1@@ ,000 d@@ on@@ ors have been inv@@ olved in the P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a move@@ ment , wh@@ ose ac@@ tions have even been used in teach@@ ing rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing at a lo@@ cal school ."
So ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res are lea@@ ving in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility behind and be@@ coming incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly re@@ spec@@ ted and val@@ u@@ ed .
"Because of their p@@ imp@@ ed car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , they are able to fi@@ ght back to pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , incre@@ ase their in@@ come and their inter@@ action with society ."
"So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging the ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res and other in@@ vi@@ sible super@@ her@@ o@@ es from your city ."
"T@@ ry to see the world as one , without b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies or fron@@ ti@@ ers ."
"@@ Be@@ li@@ e@@ ve it or not , there are over 20 million ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
"So next time you see one , recogn@@ ize them as a v@@ ital part of our society ."
"M@@ u@@ i@@ to ob@@ ri@@ ga@@ do , th@@ ank you ."
( Applause ) .
"So it &apos;s 199@@ 5 , I &apos;m in colle@@ ge , and a friend and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from P@@ ro@@ vi@@ dence , R@@ ho@@ de Is@@ land to P@@ ort@@ land , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and u@@ ne@@ mp@@ lo@@ yed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ a@@ ds through state par@@ ks and national fore@@ sts — basically the lon@@ gest rou@@ te we can pos@@ si@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of S@@ outh D@@ a@@ k@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 mil@@ es ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter I keep seeing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
My friend looks at me t@@ ot@@ ally bl@@ an@@ kly .
There &apos;s actually a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man in the front row who &apos;s doing a per@@ f@@ ect im@@ it@@ ation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sign@@ s we keep seeing with the Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few mom@@ ents , and then she cr@@ ac@@ ks up , because she fi@@ gu@@ res out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight , the fa@@ mous Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter for pic@@ n@@ ic are@@ a . ( Laughter )@@ "
"I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situ@@ ations exactly like this — why we sometimes mis@@ understand the sign@@ s around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ r@@ is say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might stri@@ ke you as a str@@ an@@ ge care@@ er move , but it actually has one great adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge : no job com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to a@@ vo@@ id thinking about being wrong , or at least to a@@ vo@@ id thinking about the pos@@ si@@ bility that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ str@@ act .
We all know everybody in this room makes mi@@ sta@@ kes .
"The human species , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — o@@ kay f@@ ine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the belie@@ f@@ s I h@@ old , here in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly all of this ab@@ str@@ act ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ bility goes out the win@@ d@@ ow — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the pres@@ ent ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se ; we go on family va@@ ca@@ tions in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and v@@ ote in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se .
"So eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely , we all kind of w@@ ind up tra@@ vel@@ ing through life , tr@@ app@@ ed in this little bu@@ b@@ ble of feel@@ ing very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individu@@ als , in our pers@@ onal and prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to conv@@ ince you that it is possible to ste@@ p outside of that feel@@ ing and that if you can do so , it is the single gre@@ ate@@ st mor@@ al , int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual and cre@@ ative lea@@ p you can make ."
So why do we get st@@ uc@@ k in this feel@@ ing of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feel@@ ing of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emoti@@ on@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ b@@ s down .
"E@@ m@@ bar@@ ra@@ ssing . O@@ kay , wonder@@ ful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ um@@ b@@ s down , em@@ bar@@ ra@@ ssing — th@@ ank you , these are great ans@@ w@@ ers , but they &apos;re ans@@ w@@ ers to a different question ."
You guys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to real@@ ize you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ al@@ iz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be de@@ va@@ st@@ ating , it can be re@@ vel@@ at@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ n@@ y , like my stu@@ p@@ id Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an anal@@ o@@ gy .
D@@ o you remember that L@@ o@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ y@@ ote who &apos;s always cha@@ sing and never ca@@ t@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ote is cha@@ sing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a c@@ li@@ ff , which is f@@ ine — he &apos;s a b@@ ird , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ote run@@ s off the c@@ li@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ n@@ y — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ote &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally f@@ ine too .
He just ke@@ e@@ ps run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and real@@ iz@@ es that he &apos;s in mi@@ d-@@ air .
That &apos;s when he f@@ all@@ s .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we real@@ ize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ote after he &apos;s g@@ one off the c@@ li@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in tr@@ ou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ rec@@ t something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it fe@@ els like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tur@@ al reason , why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r bl@@ in@@ d@@ ness .
"M@@ ost of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ n@@ al c@@ ue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing as well — and this one is cul@@ tur@@ al .
Th@@ ink back for a moment to el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school .
"You &apos;re sit@@ ting there in cla@@ ss , and your te@@ ac@@ her is h@@ anding back qu@@ i@@ z p@@ ap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not m@@ ine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the k@@ id who got this p@@ aper ."
"It &apos;s the d@@ um@@ b k@@ id , the tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker , the one who never does his h@@ ome@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ z@@ y , ir@@ respon@@ sible di@@ m@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to suc@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any mi@@ sta@@ kes ."
We learn these really bad le@@ ss@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I su@@ sp@@ ect , esp@@ eci@@ ally a lot of us in this room — de@@ al with them by just be@@ coming per@@ f@@ ect little A students , per@@ f@@ ec@@ tion@@ i@@ sts , over@@ -@@ ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ver@@ s ."
"@@ R@@ ight , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , a@@ st@@ ro@@ physi@@ ci@@ st , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , a@@ st@@ ro@@ physi@@ ci@@ sts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so f@@ ine ."
E@@ x@@ cept that then we f@@ rea@@ k out at the pos@@ si@@ bility that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ si@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smar@@ t and respon@@ sible and vir@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Be@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el D@@ e@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ e@@ di@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter for a sur@@ g@@ ery ."
Be@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ ton .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing h@@ osp@@ ital for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best h@@ osp@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"S@@ he &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ tiz@@ ed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ch@@ es her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the reco@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing see@@ ms to have g@@ one f@@ ine .
"And she wa@@ kes up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in b@@ and@@ ages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in b@@ and@@ ages because the sur@@ ge@@ on has per@@ form@@ ed a maj@@ or oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the v@@ ice pre@@ si@@ dent for health care qu@@ ality at Be@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el sp@@ o@@ ke about this in@@ ci@@ dent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or wh@@ ate@@ ver reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply felt that he was on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of the pati@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tru@@ sting too much in the feel@@ ing of being on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of anything can be very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ."
This inter@@ n@@ al sense of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a reli@@ able gu@@ i@@ de to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ining the pos@@ si@@ bility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like du@@ mp@@ ing 200 million g@@ all@@ ons of o@@ il into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or t@@ or@@ pe@@ doing the global econom@@ y ."
So this is a huge pr@@ ac@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Th@@ ink for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your belie@@ f@@ s just per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly re@@ fl@@ ect reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to expla@@ in all of those people who di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us expla@@ in those people the same way , by re@@ sor@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions ."
The first thing we u@@ su@@ ally do when someone di@@ sa@@ gre@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re i@@ gn@@ or@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have ac@@ cess to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with us , then we move on to a second as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right piec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and they are too mor@@ on@@ ic to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty smar@@ t , then we move on to a third as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion : they know the tru@@ th , and they are deli@@ ber@@ ately di@@ stor@@ ting it for their own mal@@ ev@@ ol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a ca@@ ta@@ st@@ rop@@ he .
This att@@ ach@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ke@@ e@@ ps us from pre@@ ven@@ ting mi@@ sta@@ kes when we ab@@ solu@@ tely need to and ca@@ uses us to tre@@ at each other ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most ba@@ ff@@ ling and most tra@@ gi@@ c about this is that it mi@@ ss@@ es the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly trans@@ l@@ uc@@ ent win@@ do@@ ws and we just ga@@ ze out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to ga@@ ze out of the same win@@ d@@ ow and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And y@@ eah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ t@@ es said his fa@@ mous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St@@ . Au@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , s@@ at down and wr@@ ote &quot; &quot; F@@ all@@ or er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine underst@@ ood that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ ra@@ ssing de@@ f@@ ect in the human system , something we can er@@ a@@ di@@ cate or over@@ come ."
It &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally fundam@@ ental to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like G@@ od , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other animals , we are ob@@ se@@ ssed with trying to figure it out ."
"T@@ o me , this ob@@ se@@ s@@ sion is the source and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ ti@@ vity and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"L@@ ast year , for vari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found myself list@@ ening to a lot of ep@@ is@@ o@@ des of the P@@ u@@ bli@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o show This American L@@ i@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m list@@ ening and I &apos;m list@@ ening , and at some point , I start feel@@ ing like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the cra@@ z@@ y wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness la@@ dy .
"I just ima@@ gin@@ ed it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ r@@ a G@@ la@@ ss , who &apos;s the h@@ ost of the show ."
"And I m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ af@@ f , we jo@@ ke that every single ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of our show has the same cr@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the cr@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ r@@ a G@@ la@@ ss , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mom@@ ents of surpri@@ se and re@@ ver@@ s@@ al and wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , au@@ di@@ ence mem@@ bers , as list@@ en@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot tw@@ i@@ sts and red her@@ r@@ ings and surpri@@ se end@@ ings .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"@@ G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h thought he was going to inv@@ a@@ de I@@ ra@@ q , find a b@@ unch of we@@ ap@@ ons of ma@@ ss de@@ struc@@ tion , li@@ ber@@ ate the people and bring demo@@ cr@@ acy to the M@@ i@@ ddle E@@ ast ."
And something else happened instead .
"And H@@ os@@ n@@ i M@@ u@@ bar@@ a@@ k thought he was going to be the dic@@ t@@ ator of E@@ g@@ yp@@ t for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too si@@ ck and could pas@@ s the re@@ i@@ gn@@ s of power on@@ to his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ wee@@ the@@ art and move back to your h@@ ome@@ to@@ wn and ra@@ ise a b@@ unch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was wr@@ iting an incredi@@ bly ner@@ dy book about a sub@@ ject everybody h@@ ates for an au@@ di@@ ence that would never materi@@ al@@ ize .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredi@@ ble stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ es us ."
"N@@ o off@@ en@@ se , but this entire conf@@ er@@ ence is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ u@@ ment to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just spent an entire week talking about inno@@ v@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ ce@@ ments and im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ments , but you know why we need all of those inno@@ v@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ ce@@ ments and im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ments ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d-@@ bo@@ g@@ g@@ ling and wor@@ l@@ d-@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TED 199@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) D@@ i@@ dn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )@@ "
"Wh@@ ere &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ack , Ch@@ r@@ is ? ( Laughter )@@ "
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We h@@ old another conf@@ er@@ ence .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disco@@ ver won@@ der , you need to ste@@ p outside of that tin@@ y , ter@@ ri@@ fied space of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the va@@ st@@ ness and comple@@ x@@ ity and my@@ st@@ ery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
Ma@@ ybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

N@@ os@@ air would ev@@ en@@ tually be conv@@ ic@@ ted for his inv@@ ol@@ ve@@ ment in the p@@ lot .
E@@ l@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ y@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air is my father .
It wasn &apos;t until I was seven years old that our family d@@ y@@ na@@ mic started to change .
"M@@ y father ex@@ pos@@ ed me to a side of Is@@ la@@ m that few people , inclu@@ ding the maj@@ or@@ ity of M@@ us@@ li@@ ms , get to see ."
"It &apos;s been my experience that when people take the time to inter@@ act with one another , it doesn &apos;t take long to real@@ ize that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , in every reli@@ gi@@ on , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of people who h@@ old so fer@@ v@@ ently to their belie@@ f@@ s that they feel they must use any means nec@@ ess@@ ary to make others live as they do ."
"A few months pri@@ or to his ar@@ rest , he s@@ at me down and expla@@ ined that for the past few wee@@ k@@ ends , he and some friends had been going to a sho@@ ot@@ ing ran@@ ge on L@@ ong Is@@ land for t@@ ar@@ get pr@@ acti@@ ce ."
He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next mor@@ ning .
"We ar@@ ri@@ ved at C@@ al@@ ver@@ ton S@@ ho@@ ot@@ ing R@@ an@@ ge , which un@@ be@@ know@@ n@@ st to our group was being wat@@ ched by the F@@ B@@ I ."
"When it was my turn to sh@@ oo@@ t , my father help@@ ed me h@@ old the ri@@ f@@ le to my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der and expla@@ ined how to ai@@ m at the t@@ ar@@ get about 30 y@@ ar@@ ds off ."
"That day , the last b@@ ul@@ let I sho@@ t h@@ it the small or@@ an@@ ge light that s@@ at on top of the t@@ ar@@ get and to everyone &apos;s surpri@@ se , esp@@ eci@@ ally m@@ ine , the entire t@@ ar@@ get bur@@ st into f@@ la@@ m@@ es ."
"M@@ y un@@ cle turned to the other men , and in Ar@@ ab@@ ic said , &quot; &quot; I@@ b@@ n ab@@ u@@ h . &quot; &quot; L@@ i@@ ke father , like son ."
"They all se@@ em@@ ed to get a really big la@@ u@@ gh out of that com@@ ment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully underst@@ ood what they thought was so fun@@ n@@ y ."
They thought they saw in me the same de@@ struc@@ tion my father was cap@@ able of .
"Th@@ ose men would ev@@ en@@ tually be conv@@ ic@@ ted of plac@@ ing a v@@ an f@@ ill@@ ed with 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 p@@ ounds of expl@@ os@@ i@@ ves into the sub@@ -@@ level par@@ king lot of the Wor@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter &apos;s Nor@@ th T@@ o@@ wer , ca@@ using an expl@@ os@@ i@@ on that kill@@ ed six people and in@@ ju@@ red over 1@@ ,000 others ."
These were the men I looked up to .
"Th@@ ese were the men I called am@@ m@@ u , which means un@@ cle ."
"B@@ y the time I turned 1@@ 9 , I had already mo@@ ved 20 times in my life , and that inst@@ ability during my chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood didn &apos;t really provi@@ de an opport@@ unity to make many friends ."
"E@@ ach time I would beg@@ in to feel com@@ for@@ table around someone , it was time to p@@ ack up and move to the next to@@ wn ."
"@@ Be@@ ing the per@@ pe@@ tual new face in cla@@ ss , I was f@@ requ@@ ently the t@@ ar@@ get of b@@ ul@@ lies ."
"I ke@@ pt my identi@@ ty a sec@@ re@@ t from my cla@@ ss@@ mat@@ es to a@@ vo@@ id being t@@ ar@@ ge@@ ted , but as it turns out , being the qu@@ i@@ et , ch@@ u@@ b@@ by new k@@ id in cla@@ ss was more than enough am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion ."
"So for the most part , I spent my time at home read@@ ing boo@@ ks and wat@@ ching T@@ V or pla@@ ying video g@@ am@@ es ."
"For those reas@@ ons , my social sk@@ ill@@ s were l@@ ac@@ king , to say the least , and gro@@ wing up in a big@@ ot@@ ed h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ old , I wasn &apos;t pre@@ par@@ ed for the real world ."
"I &apos;d been ra@@ is@@ ed to ju@@ dge people based on ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , like a person &apos;s r@@ ace or reli@@ gi@@ on ."
So what op@@ en@@ ed my eyes ?
One of my first experi@@ ences that challen@@ ged this way of thinking was during the 2@@ 000 pre@@ si@@ d@@ ential elec@@ tions .
"Th@@ rou@@ gh a colle@@ ge pre@@ p progra@@ m , I was able to take part in the N@@ ational Y@@ outh Con@@ ven@@ tion in P@@ h@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ p@@ hi@@ a ."
"M@@ y particular group &apos;s foc@@ us was on y@@ outh viol@@ ence , and having been the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying for most of my life , this was a sub@@ ject in which I felt partic@@ ul@@ arly pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate ."
The mem@@ bers of our group came from many different wal@@ ks of life .
"One day to@@ ward the end of the con@@ ven@@ tion , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ en@@ ded was J@@ e@@ w@@ ish ."
"I had never had a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish friend before , and f@@ ran@@ kly I felt a sense of pri@@ de in having been able to over@@ come a bar@@ ri@@ er that for most of my life I had been led to believe was in@@ sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table ."
"A@@ no@@ ther maj@@ or tur@@ ning point came when I found a su@@ mm@@ er job at B@@ us@@ ch G@@ ar@@ d@@ ens , an am@@ u@@ se@@ ment par@@ k ."
"There , I was ex@@ pos@@ ed to people from all sor@@ ts of fa@@ i@@ ths and cul@@ tures , and that experience pro@@ ved to be fundam@@ ental to the develop@@ ment of my char@@ ac@@ ter ."
"M@@ ost of my life , I &apos;d been ta@@ ught that h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ ality was a s@@ in , and by ex@@ ten@@ sion , that all g@@ ay people were a ne@@ g@@ ative in@@ flu@@ ence ."
"As chan@@ ce would have it , I had the opport@@ unity to work with some of the g@@ ay per@@ form@@ ers at a show there , and so@@ on found that many were the kin@@ de@@ st , least ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental people I had ever met ."
"@@ Be@@ ing b@@ ul@@ li@@ ed as a k@@ id created a sense of emp@@ a@@ thy in me to@@ ward the su@@ ff@@ ering of others , and it comes very un@@ nat@@ ur@@ ally to me to tre@@ at people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be tre@@ ated ."
"Because of that feel@@ ing , I was able to con@@ tra@@ st the st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es I &apos;d been ta@@ ught as a child with real life experience and inter@@ action ."
"Th@@ en there was &quot; &quot; The D@@ ai@@ ly S@@ how . &quot; &quot; O@@ n a ni@@ gh@@ tly b@@ as@@ is , J@@ on S@@ te@@ war@@ t for@@ c@@ ed me to be int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tually hon@@ est with myself about my own big@@ ot@@ ry and help@@ ed me to real@@ ize that a person &apos;s r@@ ace , reli@@ gi@@ on or se@@ x@@ u@@ al ori@@ en@@ tation had nothing to do with the qu@@ ality of one &apos;s char@@ ac@@ ter ."
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in de@@ s@@ per@@ ate need of one .
"I@@ n@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion can often come from an u@@ nex@@ p@@ ected place , and the fact that a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish com@@ e@@ di@@ an had done more to pos@@ i@@ ti@@ vely in@@ flu@@ ence my wor@@ l@@ d@@ view than my own extre@@ mi@@ st father is not lost on me ."
"One day , I had a conver@@ sa@@ tion with my mother about how my wor@@ l@@ d@@ view was star@@ ting to change , and she said something to me that I will h@@ old de@@ ar to my heart for as long as I live ."
"S@@ he looked at me with the w@@ ear@@ y eyes of someone who had experi@@ enc@@ ed enough do@@ g@@ ma@@ tis@@ m to last a li@@ fe@@ time , and said , &quot; I &apos;m ti@@ red of h@@ ating people . &quot;"
"In that inst@@ ant , I realized how much ne@@ g@@ ative energy it takes to h@@ old that h@@ at@@ red inside of you ."
Z@@ a@@ k E@@ bra@@ him is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end our connec@@ tion with my father and start a new life .
So why would I out myself and pot@@ enti@@ ally put myself in d@@ an@@ ger ?
"Well , that &apos;s simple ."
"I do it in the hop@@ es that perhaps someone some@@ day who is comp@@ ell@@ ed to use viol@@ ence may hear my story and real@@ ize that there is a better way , that al@@ though I had been sub@@ j@@ ected to this viol@@ ent , int@@ ol@@ er@@ ant ide@@ o@@ logy , that I did not become f@@ an@@ ati@@ ci@@ z@@ ed ."
"I@@ n@@ st@@ ead , I cho@@ ose to use my experience to fi@@ ght back against ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , against the big@@ ot@@ ry ."
"I do it for the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism and their lo@@ ved ones , for the ter@@ ri@@ ble pa@@ in and l@@ os@@ s that ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism has for@@ c@@ ed up@@ on their lives ."
"For the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , I will speak out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess ac@@ ts and con@@ de@@ m@@ n my father &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"And with that simple fact , I st@@ and here as pro@@ of that viol@@ ence isn &apos;t in@@ her@@ ent in one &apos;s reli@@ gi@@ on or r@@ ace , and the son does not have to fol@@ low the ways of his father ."
I am not my father .
"Th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks a lot . ( Applause )@@ "
"A few years ago , I bro@@ ke into my own house ."
"I had just dri@@ ven home , it was around mi@@ d@@ night in the de@@ ad of M@@ on@@ tre@@ al win@@ ter , I had been vi@@ sit@@ ing my friend , J@@ e@@ ff , across to@@ wn , and the ther@@ mom@@ e@@ ter on the front por@@ ch read min@@ us 40 de@@ gre@@ es — and don &apos;t b@@ other as@@ king if that &apos;s C@@ el@@ si@@ us or F@@ a@@ h@@ r@@ en@@ he@@ it , min@@ us 40 is where the two sc@@ al@@ es me@@ et — it was very co@@ ld ."
"And as I st@@ ood on the front por@@ ch fu@@ m@@ bl@@ ing in my po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts , I found I didn &apos;t have my ke@@ ys ."
"In fact , I could see them through the win@@ d@@ ow , l@@ ying on the din@@ ing room table where I had left them ."
"So I quickly r@@ an around and tried all the other do@@ ors and win@@ do@@ ws , and they were lo@@ c@@ ked ti@@ ght ."
"I thought about call@@ ing a lo@@ ck@@ sm@@ ith — at least I had my c@@ ell@@ phone , but at mi@@ d@@ night , it could take a while for a lo@@ ck@@ sm@@ ith to show up , and it was co@@ ld ."
"I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend J@@ e@@ ff &apos;s house for the night because I had an early f@@ light to Eu@@ rop@@ e the next mor@@ ning , and I needed to get my pas@@ sp@@ ort and my su@@ it@@ case ."
"So , de@@ s@@ per@@ ate and f@@ ree@@ zing co@@ ld , I found a large ro@@ ck and I bro@@ ke through the ba@@ se@@ ment win@@ d@@ ow , c@@ lear@@ ed out the shar@@ ds of g@@ la@@ ss , I cra@@ w@@ led through , I found a piece of car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard and t@@ ap@@ ed it up over the op@@ ening , fig@@ uring that in the mor@@ ning , on the way to the a@@ ir@@ p@@ ort , I could call my con@@ trac@@ tor and ask him to fi@@ x it ."
"This was going to be exp@@ en@@ sive , but probably no more exp@@ en@@ sive than a mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ night lo@@ ck@@ sm@@ ith , so I fi@@ gu@@ red , under the cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es , I was coming out even ."
"Now , I &apos;m a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ st by tra@@ ining and I know a little bit about how the brain per@@ for@@ ms under stre@@ ss ."
"It re@@ le@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l that ra@@ is@@ es your heart r@@ ate , it mo@@ d@@ ul@@ ates ad@@ r@@ en@@ al@@ ine le@@ vel@@ s and it cl@@ ou@@ ds your thinking ."
"So the next mor@@ ning , when I w@@ o@@ ke up on too little s@@ le@@ ep , wor@@ r@@ ying about the h@@ ole in the win@@ d@@ ow , and a mental not@@ e that I had to call my con@@ trac@@ tor , and the f@@ ree@@ zing te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res , and the me@@ et@@ ings I had up@@ coming in Eu@@ rop@@ e , and , you know , with all the cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l in my brain , my thinking was cl@@ ou@@ dy , but I didn &apos;t know it was cl@@ ou@@ dy because my thinking was cl@@ ou@@ dy ."
"( Laughter ) And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the a@@ ir@@ p@@ ort ch@@ ec@@ k@@ -@@ in coun@@ ter , that I realized I didn &apos;t have my pas@@ sp@@ ort . ( Laughter )@@ "
"So I r@@ ac@@ ed home in the s@@ now and ice , 40 minutes , got my pas@@ sp@@ ort , r@@ ac@@ ed back to the a@@ ir@@ p@@ ort , I made it just in time , but they had given away my se@@ at to someone else , so I got st@@ uc@@ k in the back of the plan@@ e , next to the ba@@ th@@ ro@@ om@@ s , in a se@@ at that w@@ ouldn &apos;t re@@ cl@@ ine , on an e@@ igh@@ t-@@ h@@ our f@@ light ."
"Well , I had a lot of time to think during those e@@ ight hours and no s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Laughter ) And I started wonder@@ ing , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will pre@@ v@@ ent bad things from happening ?"
"O@@ r at least if bad things happen , will min@@ i@@ mi@@ ze the like@@ li@@ h@@ ood of it being a t@@ ot@@ al ca@@ ta@@ st@@ rop@@ he ."
"So I started thinking about that , but my thou@@ ghts didn &apos;t cr@@ y@@ st@@ al@@ li@@ ze until about a mon@@ th later ."
"I was having din@@ ner with my colle@@ ag@@ ue , D@@ an@@ n@@ y K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man , the N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze win@@ ner , and I some@@ what em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ se@@ d@@ ly told him about having bro@@ ken my win@@ d@@ ow , and , you know , for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten my pas@@ sp@@ ort , and D@@ an@@ n@@ y shar@@ ed with me that he &apos;d been pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing something called pr@@ osp@@ ective h@@ in@@ d@@ si@@ ght ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he had g@@ ot@@ ten from the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ st G@@ ary K@@ le@@ in , who had wr@@ it@@ ten about it a few years before , also called the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m ."
"Now , you all know what the pos@@ t@@ mor@@ te@@ m is ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever there &apos;s a di@@ sa@@ ster , a team of exper@@ ts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?"
"Well , in the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m , D@@ an@@ n@@ y expla@@ ined , you look a@@ head and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to pre@@ v@@ ent those things from happening , or to min@@ i@@ mi@@ ze the da@@ ma@@ ge ."
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
"S@@ ome of them are obvi@@ ous , some of them are not so obvi@@ ous ."
I &apos;ll start with the obvi@@ ous ones .
"A@@ r@@ ound the home , design@@ ate a place for things that are ea@@ si@@ ly lost ."
"Now , this s@@ ounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our sp@@ ati@@ al mem@@ ory works ."
"There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hi@@ p@@ po@@ ca@@ mp@@ us , that ev@@ olved over ten@@ s of thousands of years , to keep tr@@ ack of the lo@@ ca@@ tions of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that st@@ and of f@@ ru@@ it tre@@ es , where the fri@@ end@@ ly and ene@@ my tri@@ b@@ es live ."
The hi@@ p@@ po@@ ca@@ mp@@ us is the part of the brain that in L@@ on@@ don ta@@ x@@ i@@ ca@@ b dri@@ ver@@ s be@@ comes en@@ lar@@ ged .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allo@@ ws squ@@ ir@@ re@@ ls to find their n@@ u@@ ts .
"And if you &apos;re wonder@@ ing , somebody actually did the experi@@ ment where they c@@ ut off the ol@@ fac@@ t@@ ory sense of the squ@@ ir@@ re@@ ls , and they could still find their n@@ u@@ ts ."
"They wer@@ en &apos;t using sm@@ ell , they were using the hi@@ p@@ po@@ ca@@ mp@@ us , this ex@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ ely ev@@ olved m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism in the brain for fin@@ ding things ."
"But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around ."
So this is why we l@@ ose car ke@@ ys and read@@ ing g@@ la@@ ss@@ es and pas@@ sp@@ or@@ ts .
"So in the home , design@@ ate a sp@@ ot for your ke@@ ys — a h@@ oo@@ k by the do@@ or , maybe a dec@@ or@@ ative bo@@ w@@ l ."
"For your pas@@ sp@@ ort , a particular dra@@ wer ."
"For your read@@ ing g@@ la@@ ss@@ es , a particular table ."
"If you design@@ ate a sp@@ ot and you &apos;re sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them ."
What about tra@@ vel ?
"T@@ a@@ ke a cell phone picture of your cre@@ d@@ it car@@ ds , your dri@@ ver &apos;s li@@ cen@@ se , your pas@@ sp@@ ort , ma@@ il it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cl@@ ou@@ d ."
"If these things are lost or st@@ ol@@ en , you can fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate re@@ plac@@ e@@ ment ."
Now these are some rather obvi@@ ous things .
"@@ Re@@ member , when you &apos;re under stre@@ ss , the brain re@@ le@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l ."
"C@@ or@@ ti@@ so@@ l is to@@ x@@ ic , and it ca@@ uses cl@@ ou@@ dy thinking ."
"So part of the pr@@ acti@@ ce of the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to recogn@@ ize that under stre@@ ss you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place ."
And there &apos;s perhaps no more stre@@ ss@@ ful a situ@@ ation than when you &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with a medi@@ cal deci@@ sion to make .
"And at some point , all of us are going to be in that pos@@ ition , where we have to make a very important deci@@ sion about the future of our medi@@ cal care or that of a lo@@ ved one , to help them with a deci@@ sion ."
And so I want to talk about that .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medi@@ cal condi@@ tion .
"But this st@@ ands as a pro@@ x@@ y for all kinds of medi@@ cal deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making , and in@@ de@@ ed for fin@@ anci@@ al deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making , and social deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making — any kind of deci@@ sion you have to make that would b@@ ene@@ f@@ it from a ra@@ tional as@@ se@@ ss@@ ment of the fac@@ ts ."
"So supp@@ ose you go to your doc@@ tor and the doc@@ tor says , &quot; I just got your la@@ b work back , your cho@@ le@@ st@@ er@@ o@@ l &apos;s a little high . &quot;"
"Now , you all know that high cho@@ le@@ st@@ er@@ o@@ l is as@@ soci@@ ated with an incre@@ ased risk of car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar disease , heart att@@ ack , st@@ ro@@ ke ."
It &apos;s for the number needed to tre@@ at .
"Now , what is this , the N@@ N@@ T ?"
It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a dru@@ g or under@@ go a sur@@ g@@ ery or any medi@@ cal pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure before one person is help@@ ed .
"And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of cra@@ z@@ y st@@ ati@@ stic is that ?"
The number should be one .
My doc@@ tor w@@ ouldn &apos;t pre@@ scri@@ be something to me if it &apos;s not going to help .
"But actually , medi@@ cal pr@@ acti@@ ce doesn &apos;t work that way ."
"And it &apos;s not the doc@@ tor &apos;s fa@@ ult , if it &apos;s any@@ body &apos;s fa@@ ult , it &apos;s the fa@@ ult of scientists like me ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t fi@@ gu@@ red out the under@@ l@@ ying m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ ms well enough .
But G@@ la@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mi@@ th@@ K@@ line es@@ ti@@ mat@@ es that 9@@ 0 percent of the dru@@ gs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
"So the number needed to tre@@ at for the most wi@@ de@@ ly pre@@ scri@@ bed st@@ ati@@ n , what do you supp@@ ose it is ?"
How many people have to take it before one person is help@@ ed ?
3@@ 00 .
I r@@ an through the numbers myself .
"@@ 3@@ 00 people have to take the dru@@ g for a year before one heart att@@ ack , st@@ ro@@ ke or other ad@@ ver@@ se ev@@ ent is pre@@ ven@@ ted ."
"Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , O@@ K , one in 3@@ 00 chan@@ ce of lo@@ wer@@ ing my cho@@ le@@ st@@ er@@ o@@ l ."
"Wh@@ y not , do@@ c ? G@@ i@@ ve me the pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tion any@@ way . &quot; &quot; But you should ask at this point for another st@@ ati@@ stic , and that is , &quot; &quot; T@@ ell me about the side eff@@ ects . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"So for this particular dru@@ g , the side eff@@ ects oc@@ cu@@ r in five percent of the patients ."
"And they inclu@@ de ter@@ ri@@ ble things — de@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ ating m@@ us@@ cle and jo@@ int pa@@ in , ga@@ st@@ ro@@ in@@ te@@ st@@ in@@ al di@@ stre@@ ss — but now you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; F@@ i@@ ve percent , not very like@@ ly it &apos;s going to happen to me , I &apos;ll still take the dru@@ g . &quot; &quot; But wa@@ it a min@@ u@@ te ."
Re@@ member under stre@@ ss you &apos;re not thinking c@@ lear@@ ly .
"So think about how you &apos;re going to work through this a@@ head of time , so you don &apos;t have to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture the cha@@ in of reas@@ on@@ ing on the sp@@ ot ."
"@@ 3@@ 00 people take the dru@@ g , right ? One person &apos;s help@@ ed , five percent of those 3@@ 00 have side eff@@ ects , that &apos;s 15 people ."
You &apos;re 15 times more like@@ ly to be har@@ med by the dru@@ g than you are to be help@@ ed by the dru@@ g .
"Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the st@@ ati@@ n or not ."
I &apos;m just saying you should have this conver@@ sa@@ tion with your doc@@ tor .
"M@@ e@@ di@@ cal e@@ th@@ ics requ@@ i@@ res it , it &apos;s part of the prin@@ ci@@ ple of in@@ form@@ ed con@@ s@@ ent ."
You have the right to have ac@@ cess to this kind of information to beg@@ in the conver@@ sa@@ tion about whether you want to take the ris@@ ks or not .
"Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve pul@@ led this number out of the air for sho@@ ck val@@ ue , but in fact it &apos;s rather t@@ y@@ pi@@ cal , this number needed to tre@@ at ."
"For the most wi@@ de@@ ly per@@ form@@ ed sur@@ g@@ ery on men over the age of 50 , re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of the pr@@ os@@ t@@ ate for cancer , the number needed to tre@@ at is 4@@ 9 ."
"That &apos;s right , 4@@ 9 sur@@ g@@ er@@ ies are done for every one person who &apos;s help@@ ed ."
And the side eff@@ ects in that case oc@@ cu@@ r in 50 percent of the patients .
"They inclu@@ de imp@@ ot@@ ence , er@@ ec@@ ti@@ le d@@ y@@ s@@ fun@@ c@@ tion , ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence , rec@@ t@@ al t@@ ear@@ ing , fe@@ cal in@@ contin@@ ence ."
"And if you &apos;re l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two ."
So the idea of the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to think a@@ head of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will p@@ us@@ h the conver@@ sa@@ tion for@@ ward .
You don &apos;t want to have to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture all of this on the sp@@ ot .
And you also want to think about things like qu@@ ality of life .
"Because you have a cho@@ ice of@@ t@@ enti@@ m@@ es , do you I want a sh@@ or@@ ter life that &apos;s pa@@ in@@ -@@ free , or a longer life that might have a great de@@ al of pa@@ in to@@ wards the end ?"
"Th@@ ese are things to talk about and think about now , with your family and your lo@@ ved ones ."
"You might change your mind in the he@@ at of the moment , but at least you &apos;re pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed with this kind of thinking ."
"@@ Re@@ member , our brain under stre@@ ss re@@ le@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole b@@ unch on systems sh@@ ut down ."
There &apos;s an ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary reason for this .
"F@@ ace@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ face with a pre@@ dat@@ or , you don &apos;t need your di@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve system , or your li@@ bi@@ do , or your im@@ m@@ un@@ e system , because if you &apos;re body is exp@@ ending me@@ t@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ s@@ m on those things and you don &apos;t re@@ act quickly , you might become the li@@ on &apos;s l@@ unch , and then n@@ one of those things matter ."
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , one of the things that goes out the win@@ d@@ ow during those times of stre@@ ss is ra@@ tional , logical thinking , as D@@ an@@ n@@ y K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man and his colle@@ ag@@ ues have sh@@ own ."
So we need to tra@@ in ourselves to think a@@ head to these kinds of situ@@ ations .
I think the important point here is recogn@@ iz@@ ing that all of us are f@@ la@@ wed .
We all are going to fa@@ il now and then .
"The idea is to think a@@ head to what those fa@@ il@@ u@@ res might be , to put systems in place that will help min@@ i@@ mi@@ ze the da@@ ma@@ ge , or to pre@@ v@@ ent the bad things from happening in the first place ."
"@@ G@@ e@@ tting back to that s@@ no@@ w@@ y night in M@@ on@@ tre@@ al , when I got back from my tri@@ p , I had my con@@ trac@@ tor inst@@ all a com@@ b@@ in@@ ation lo@@ ck next to the do@@ or , with a key to the front do@@ or in it , an easy to remember com@@ b@@ in@@ ation ."
"And I have to ad@@ m@@ it , I still have p@@ il@@ es of ma@@ il that ha@@ ven &apos;t been sor@@ ted , and p@@ il@@ es of e@@ ma@@ il@@ s that I ha@@ ven &apos;t g@@ one through ."
"So I &apos;m not completely organ@@ ized , but I see organ@@ ization as a gra@@ du@@ al process , and I &apos;m getting there ."
Thank you very much .

"S@@ u@@ sta@@ in@@ ability re@@ pres@@ ents the what , the where and the how of what is ca@@ ught ."
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my din@@ ner cho@@ ices .
I want to know how I imp@@ act them .
I want to know how they imp@@ act me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they re@@ ly on the water &apos;s b@@ oun@@ ty for their living .
Un@@ der@@ st@@ anding all of this en@@ ab@@ les us to shi@@ ft our per@@ cep@@ tion of se@@ af@@ ood away from a com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity to an opport@@ unity to re@@ st@@ ore our ec@@ os@@ y@@ ste@@ m .
It allo@@ ws for us to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the se@@ af@@ ood that we &apos;re also so for@@ tun@@ ate to e@@ at .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood .
"Wh@@ ere su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability is the cap@@ ac@@ ity to end@@ ure and ma@@ in@@ tain , re@@ stor@@ ative is the ability to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish and pro@@ gre@@ ss ."
"@@ R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood allo@@ ws for an ev@@ ol@@ ving and d@@ y@@ na@@ mic system and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges our relation@@ ship with the oce@@ an as a re@@ source , su@@ g@@ ge@@ sting that we eng@@ age to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the oce@@ an and to enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge its re@@ si@@ li@@ enc@@ y ."
"It is a more hop@@ e@@ ful , it is a more human , and is a more u@@ se@@ ful way of underst@@ anding our environment ."
W@@ al@@ let gu@@ i@@ des — st@@ and@@ ard issu@@ e by lots in the mar@@ ine con@@ serv@@ ation world — are very h@@ an@@ dy ; they &apos;re a wonder@@ ful too@@ l .
"@@ G@@ re@@ en , y@@ el@@ low and red li@@ sts &#91; of &#93; se@@ af@@ ood species ."
"The as@@ soci@@ ation is very easy : bu@@ y green , don &apos;t bu@@ y red , think tw@@ ice about y@@ el@@ low ."
"But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just e@@ at green li@@ st ."
We can &apos;t su@@ sta@@ in this without the meas@@ ure of our suc@@ cess really chan@@ ging the f@@ ate of the species in the y@@ el@@ low and the red .
But what if we e@@ at only in the green li@@ st ?
You &apos;ve got po@@ le@@ -@@ ca@@ ught y@@ el@@ lo@@ w@@ f@@ in tun@@ a here — comes from su@@ sta@@ in@@ able st@@ oc@@ ks .
P@@ ole ca@@ ught — no b@@ y@@ ca@@ t@@ ch .
G@@ re@@ at for fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men . L@@ ots of money . S@@ u@@ pp@@ or@@ ting lo@@ cal econom@@ ies .
But it &apos;s a li@@ on of the se@@ a . It &apos;s a top pre@@ dat@@ or .
What &apos;s the cont@@ ext of this me@@ al ?
A@@ m I sit@@ ting down in a st@@ ea@@ k@@ house to a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of this ?
D@@ o I do this three times a week ?
"I might still be in the green li@@ st , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oce@@ ans any fa@@ v@@ ors ."
"The point is that we have to have a cont@@ ext , a g@@ au@@ ge for our ac@@ tions in all this ."
E@@ x@@ a@@ mple : I &apos;ve heard that red w@@ ine is great for my health — anti@@ o@@ x@@ id@@ ants and min@@ er@@ als — heart heal@@ thy .
That &apos;s great ! I love red w@@ ine !
I &apos;m going to dr@@ ink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so heal@@ thy .
"Well , how many bot@@ t@@ les is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?"
"Well fol@@ ks , we have a prot@@ e@@ in problem ."
"We have lost this sen@@ si@@ bility when it re@@ gar@@ ds our food , and we are pa@@ ying a cost ."
The problem is we are hi@@ ding that cost b@@ ene@@ ath the wa@@ ves .
We are hi@@ ding that cost behind the social ac@@ cep@@ t@@ ance of exp@@ anding wa@@ ist@@ l@@ ines .
And we are hi@@ ding that cost behind mon@@ ster prof@@ its .
So the first thing about this idea of re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood is that it really takes into ac@@ coun@@ t our needs .
"@@ R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood might best be re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted not by J@@ a@@ ws , or by F@@ li@@ pp@@ er , or the G@@ or@@ don &apos;s fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man , but rather , by the J@@ ol@@ ly G@@ re@@ en G@@ i@@ ant ."
V@@ e@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les : they might yet sa@@ ve the oce@@ ans .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a li@@ kes to say that bl@@ ue is the new green .
Well I &apos;d like to re@@ spec@@ t@@ fully sub@@ m@@ it that bro@@ c@@ col@@ i green might then be the new bl@@ ue .
"We must contin@@ ue to e@@ at the best se@@ af@@ ood possible , if at all ."
But we also must e@@ at it with a ton of ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
The best part about re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood though is that it comes on the hal@@ f-@@ sh@@ ell with a bot@@ tle of T@@ ab@@ as@@ c@@ o and le@@ m@@ on we@@ d@@ ges .
"It comes in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of ti@@ l@@ ap@@ ia b@@ read@@ ed with D@@ i@@ j@@ on mu@@ star@@ d and cri@@ sp@@ y , bro@@ il@@ ed b@@ read@@ cr@@ um@@ b@@ s and a st@@ ea@@ m@@ ing pi@@ le of pe@@ can qu@@ in@@ o@@ a p@@ il@@ a@@ f with cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y , g@@ ri@@ l@@ led bro@@ c@@ col@@ i so so@@ ft and s@@ we@@ et and char@@ red and s@@ mo@@ k@@ y on the outside with just a h@@ int of chil@@ i f@@ la@@ ke ."
Wh@@ oo@@ o !
This is an easy s@@ ell .
And the best part is all of those in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents are a@@ va@@ il@@ able to every family at the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood W@@ al@@ mar@@ t .
J@@ a@@ mi@@ e O@@ li@@ ver is ca@@ mp@@ ai@@ gn@@ ing to sa@@ ve America from the way we e@@ at .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a is ca@@ mp@@ ai@@ gn@@ ing to sa@@ ve the oce@@ ans from the way we e@@ at .
There &apos;s a pat@@ ter@@ n here .
F@@ or@@ get n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar ho@@ lo@@ ca@@ ust ; it &apos;s the for@@ k that we have to wor@@ ry about .
We have ra@@ v@@ ag@@ ed our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sour@@ c@@ ed to h@@ an@@ di@@ ca@@ p ourselves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole e@@ ating thing wrong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we exp@@ ect from our food .
S@@ u@@ sta@@ in@@ ability is comp@@ li@@ cated but din@@ ner is a reality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of move@@ ment rec@@ ently in gre@@ ening our food systems .
D@@ an B@@ ar@@ ber and A@@ li@@ ce W@@ at@@ ers are lead@@ ing pas@@ si@@ on@@ ately the green food D@@ e@@ li@@ ci@@ ous R@@ ev@@ olution .
But green f@@ oo@@ ds often re@@ pres@@ ent a way for us to dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard the respon@@ si@@ bility as e@@ at@@ ers .
J@@ ust because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can tre@@ at it with dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard on the pl@@ ate .
We have ec@@ o@@ -@@ fri@@ end@@ ly sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any ec@@ o@@ -@@ fri@@ end@@ ly all@@ -@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ e@@ at sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p bu@@ ff@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t work .
H@@ ear@@ t-@@ heal@@ thy din@@ ner is a very important part of re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood .
"W@@ hi@@ le we try to man@@ age dec@@ l@@ ining mar@@ ine pop@@ u@@ la@@ tions , the media &apos;s re@@ comm@@ ending incre@@ ased con@@ su@@ mp@@ tion of se@@ af@@ ood ."
"S@@ tu@@ dies say that ten@@ s of thousands of American gr@@ and@@ mo@@ thers , gr@@ and@@ fa@@ thers , mo@@ thers and fa@@ thers might be around for another bir@@ th@@ day if we inclu@@ ded more se@@ af@@ ood ."
That &apos;s a re@@ ward I am not w@@ ill@@ ing to pas@@ s up .
But it &apos;s not all about the se@@ af@@ ood .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our pl@@ ates .
"As a che@@ f , I real@@ ize the ea@@ si@@ est thing for me to do is re@@ duce the por@@ tion si@@ z@@ es on my pl@@ ate ."
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
"@@ People started bu@@ ying appe@@ tiz@@ ers and s@@ al@@ a@@ ds , because they knew they wer@@ en &apos;t going to f@@ ill up on the ent@@ re@@ es alone ."
"@@ People spent more time eng@@ ag@@ ing in their me@@ als , eng@@ ag@@ ing with each other over their me@@ als ."
"@@ People got , in sh@@ ort , more of what they came there for even though they got less prot@@ e@@ in ."
They got more cal@@ or@@ ies over the course of a di@@ ver@@ si@@ fied me@@ al .
They got heal@@ th@@ i@@ er . I made more money .
This is great .
"E@@ n@@ viron@@ mental consi@@ der@@ ation was ser@@ ved with every pl@@ ate , but it was ser@@ ved with a he@@ ap@@ ing m@@ ound of consi@@ der@@ ation for human interest@@ s at the same time ."
"One of the other things we did was beg@@ in to di@@ ver@@ si@@ f@@ y the species that we ser@@ ved — small si@@ l@@ ver@@ fish , an@@ cho@@ vi@@ es , m@@ ack@@ er@@ el , s@@ ar@@ d@@ ines were un@@ common ."
"S@@ h@@ ell@@ fish , m@@ us@@ sel@@ s , o@@ y@@ st@@ ers , cla@@ ms , ti@@ l@@ ap@@ ia , cha@@ r — these were the common species ."
"We were direc@@ ting ta@@ st@@ es to@@ wards more re@@ si@@ li@@ ence , more re@@ stor@@ ative op@@ tions ."
This is what we need to fa@@ v@@ or .
This is what the green li@@ st says .
But this is also how we can actually beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore our environment .
"But what of those big pre@@ dat@@ ors , those fa@@ shi@@ on@@ able species , that green li@@ st tun@@ a that I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er ?"
"Well , if you must , I have a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for you ."
"It pretty much works with any big fish in the oce@@ an , so here we go ."
St@@ art with a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of big fish .
G@@ et a k@@ ni@@ fe . C@@ ut it into four por@@ tions .
P@@ ut it on four pl@@ ates .
"M@@ ound up those four pl@@ ates with ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les and then open up the very best bot@@ tle of B@@ ur@@ g@@ und@@ y you have , light the c@@ and@@ les and c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate it ."
C@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the opport@@ unity you have to e@@ at this .
"I@@ n@@ v@@ ite your friends and ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors over and re@@ pe@@ at once a year , maybe ."
I exp@@ ect a lot from food .
I exp@@ ect health and jo@@ y and family and community .
"I exp@@ ect that produc@@ ing in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents , pre@@ par@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es and e@@ ating me@@ als is all part of the communi@@ on of human interest@@ s ."
I was l@@ uc@@ k@@ y enough that my father was a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic c@@ oo@@ k .
And he ta@@ ught me very early on about the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge that e@@ ating re@@ pres@@ ents .
I remember well the me@@ als of my chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood .
"They were reas@@ on@@ able por@@ tions of prot@@ e@@ in ser@@ ved with cop@@ i@@ ous qu@@ anti@@ ties of ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les and small amoun@@ ts of star@@ ch , u@@ su@@ ally ri@@ ce ."
This is still how I lar@@ ge@@ ly e@@ at today .
I get si@@ ck when I go to st@@ ea@@ k@@ h@@ ous@@ es .
I get the me@@ at s@@ we@@ ats .
It &apos;s like a h@@ an@@ go@@ ver from prot@@ e@@ in .
It &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ sting .
"But of all the di@@ re news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oce@@ ans , I have the un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate bur@@ den of deli@@ ver@@ ing to you pos@@ si@@ bly the very wor@@ st of it and that is this whole time your mother was right ."
E@@ at your ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
It &apos;s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward .
So what are we looking for in a me@@ al ?
"Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wh@@ o@@ le@@ some in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that are good for my body ."
"For jo@@ y , I &apos;m looking for bu@@ tter and s@@ al@@ t and se@@ x@@ y things that make things ta@@ st@@ e less like p@@ en@@ ance ."
"For family , I &apos;m looking for re@@ ci@@ p@@ es that gen@@ u@@ fl@@ ect to my own pers@@ onal hi@@ stories ."
"For community though , we start at the very begin@@ ning ."
There &apos;s no es@@ cap@@ ing the fact that everything we e@@ at has a global imp@@ act .
So try and learn as best you can what that imp@@ act is and then take the first ste@@ p to min@@ i@@ mi@@ ze it .
"We &apos;ve seen an image of our bl@@ ue planet , our world b@@ ank ."
But it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our re@@ sources ; it &apos;s also the global ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ y of the communi@@ on we call din@@ ner .
"So if we all take only what we need , then we can beg@@ in to share the rest , we can beg@@ in to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate , we can beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore ."
We need to sa@@ v@@ or ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
We need to sa@@ v@@ or sm@@ all@@ er por@@ tions of se@@ af@@ ood .
And we need to sa@@ ve din@@ ner .
Thank you .
( Applause )
H@@ i . I am an archit@@ ect .
"I am the only archit@@ ect in the world making buil@@ d@@ ings out of p@@ aper like this car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard tu@@ be , and this ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion is the first one I did using p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es ."
"@@ 19@@ 8@@ 6 , much , much longer before people started talking about ec@@ o@@ logical issu@@ es and environ@@ mental issu@@ es , I just started te@@ sting the p@@ aper tu@@ be in order to use this as a building structure ."
"It &apos;s very comp@@ li@@ cated to test the new materi@@ al for the building , but this is much str@@ on@@ ger than I exp@@ ected , and also it &apos;s very easy to wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and also , because it &apos;s indu@@ stri@@ al materi@@ al , it &apos;s also possible to fi@@ re@@ pro@@ of ."
"Th@@ en I built the te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary structure , 199@@ 0 ."
This is the first te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary building made out of p@@ aper .
"There are 3@@ 30 tu@@ b@@ es , di@@ a@@ me@@ ter 5@@ 5 &#91; c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters &#93; , there are only 12 tu@@ b@@ es with a di@@ a@@ me@@ ter of 1@@ 20 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters , or four fe@@ et , wi@@ de ."
"As you see it in the phot@@ o , inside is the to@@ i@@ let ."
"In case you &apos;re fin@@ i@@ shed with to@@ i@@ let p@@ aper , you can t@@ ear off the inside of the w@@ all . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very u@@ se@@ ful ."
"@@ Y@@ ear 2@@ 000 , there was a big exp@@ o in G@@ er@@ many ."
"I was asked to design the building , because the the@@ me of the exp@@ o was environ@@ mental issu@@ es ."
"So I was ch@@ os@@ en to build the pa@@ vi@@ li@@ on out of p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es , rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able p@@ aper ."
My go@@ al of the design is not when it &apos;s comple@@ ted .
"M@@ y go@@ al was when the building was demo@@ li@@ shed , because each country makes a lot of pa@@ vi@@ li@@ ons but after half a year , we create a lot of indu@@ stri@@ al wa@@ st@@ e , so my building has to be re@@ used or rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
"A@@ f@@ ter , the building was rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
So that was the go@@ al of my design .
Th@@ en I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to w@@ in the com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion to build the second P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in F@@ r@@ ance in the city of M@@ et@@ z .
"Because I was so poor , I wanted to r@@ ent an off@@ ice in P@@ ar@@ is , but I couldn &apos;t aff@@ ord it , so I decided to bring my students to P@@ ar@@ is to build our off@@ ice on top of the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in P@@ ar@@ is by ourselves ."
So we b@@ rought the p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es and the w@@ oo@@ den jo@@ in@@ ts to comple@@ te the 3@@ 5@@ -@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ long off@@ ice .
We sta@@ yed there for six years without pa@@ ying any r@@ ent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
"Because we were part of the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to bu@@ y a tic@@ k@@ et to see me ."
That was the problem .
Th@@ en I comple@@ ted the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in M@@ et@@ z .
"It &apos;s a very pop@@ ular mu@@ se@@ um now , and I created a big mon@@ u@@ ment for the government ."
"But then I was very dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ted at my prof@@ es@@ sion as an archit@@ ect , because we are not help@@ ing , we are not working for society , but we are working for pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged people , ri@@ ch people , government , develop@@ ers ."
They have money and power .
Th@@ ose are in@@ vi@@ sible .
So they h@@ ire us to vi@@ su@@ al@@ ize their power and money by making mon@@ um@@ ental archit@@ ec@@ ture .
"That is our prof@@ es@@ sion , even hi@@ stor@@ ic@@ ally it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same ."
"So I was very dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ted that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their h@@ ous@@ es by natural di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers ."
But I must say they are no longer natural di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers .
"For example , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ kes never k@@ ill people , but coll@@ ap@@ se of the buil@@ d@@ ings k@@ ill people ."
That &apos;s the respon@@ si@@ bility of archit@@ ects .
"Th@@ en people need some te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing , but there are no archit@@ ects working there because we are too bus@@ y working for pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged people ."
"So I thought , even as archit@@ ects , we can be inv@@ olved in the re@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing ."
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in di@@ sa@@ ster are@@ as .
"@@ 199@@ 4 , there was a big di@@ sa@@ ster in R@@ w@@ and@@ a , Africa ."
"T@@ w@@ o tri@@ b@@ es , H@@ ut@@ u and T@@ ut@@ s@@ i , f@@ ou@@ ght each other ."
O@@ ver two million people became re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
"But I was so surpri@@ sed to see the sh@@ el@@ ter , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ m@@ p organ@@ ized by the U.@@ N@@ ."
"They &apos;re so poor , and they are f@@ ree@@ zing with bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ts during the ra@@ in@@ y se@@ as@@ on , In the sh@@ el@@ ters built by the U.@@ N@@ . , they were just provi@@ ding a pla@@ stic sh@@ e@@ et , and the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es had to c@@ ut the tre@@ es , and just like this ."
But over two million people c@@ ut tre@@ es .
"It just became big , hea@@ v@@ y de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation and an environ@@ mental problem ."
"That is why they started provi@@ ding al@@ um@@ in@@ um pi@@ p@@ es , al@@ um@@ in@@ um bar@@ r@@ ac@@ ks ."
"@@ V@@ ery exp@@ en@@ sive , they th@@ row them out for money , then cu@@ tting tre@@ es again ."
"So I pro@@ pos@@ ed my idea to im@@ pro@@ ve the situ@@ ation using these rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es because this is so ch@@ ea@@ p and also so str@@ ong , but my bu@@ d@@ get is only 50 U.@@ S@@ . dollars per un@@ it ."
"We built 50 un@@ its to do that as a mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing test for the d@@ ur@@ ability and mo@@ ist@@ ure and ter@@ m@@ it@@ es , so on ."
"And then , year af@@ ter@@ ward , 199@@ 5 , in K@@ o@@ be , J@@ ap@@ an , we had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke ."
"N@@ early 7@@ ,000 people were kill@@ ed , and the city like this N@@ ag@@ at@@ a di@@ stri@@ c@@ t , all the city was bur@@ ned in a fir@@ e after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke ."
And also I found out there &apos;s many V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ me@@ se re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es su@@ ff@@ ering and ga@@ ther@@ ing at a C@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c ch@@ ur@@ ch — all the building was t@@ ot@@ ally de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed .
"So I went there and also I pro@@ pos@@ ed to the pri@@ est@@ s , &quot; Why don &apos;t we re@@ build the ch@@ ur@@ ch out of p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; O@@ h G@@ od , are you cra@@ z@@ y ?"
"A@@ f@@ ter a fir@@ e , what are you pro@@ pos@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; So he never tru@@ sted me , but I didn &apos;t give up ."
"I started comm@@ u@@ ting to K@@ o@@ be , and I met the society of V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ me@@ se people ."
They were living like this with very poor pla@@ stic sh@@ e@@ ets in the par@@ k .
So I pro@@ pos@@ ed to re@@ build . I ra@@ is@@ ed — did fund@@ ra@@ is@@ ing .
"I made a p@@ aper tu@@ be sh@@ el@@ ter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demo@@ lish , I used be@@ er cr@@ ates as a f@@ ound@@ ation ."
"I asked the K@@ ir@@ in be@@ er company to pro@@ p@@ ose , because at that time , the A@@ sa@@ h@@ i be@@ er company made their pla@@ stic be@@ er cr@@ ates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the col@@ or of the p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es ."
The col@@ or co@@ ordin@@ ation is very important .
"And also I still remember , we were exp@@ ec@@ ting to have a be@@ er inside the pla@@ stic be@@ er cr@@ ate , but it came emp@@ ty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ting ."
"So during the su@@ mm@@ er with my students , we built over 50 un@@ its of the sh@@ el@@ ters ."
"F@@ in@@ ally the pri@@ est , finally he tru@@ sted me to re@@ build ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you coll@@ ect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks re@@ building the ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"It was me@@ ant to st@@ ay there for three years , but actually it sta@@ yed there 10 years because people lo@@ ved it ."
"Th@@ en , in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an , they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , and we pro@@ pos@@ ed to d@@ on@@ ate this ch@@ ur@@ ch , so we dis@@ man@@ t@@ led them , we s@@ ent them over to be built by v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er people ."
It sta@@ yed there in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an as a per@@ man@@ ent ch@@ ur@@ ch even now .
So this building became a per@@ man@@ ent building .
"Th@@ en I won@@ der , what is a per@@ man@@ ent and what is a te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary building ?"
E@@ ven a building made in p@@ aper can be per@@ man@@ ent as long as people love it .
E@@ ven a con@@ cre@@ te building can be very te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary if that is made to make money .
"In 199@@ 9 , in T@@ ur@@ key , the big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , I went there to use the lo@@ cal materi@@ al to build a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"@@ 200@@ 1 , in W@@ est In@@ dia , I built also a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"In 200@@ 4 , in S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ k@@ a , after the S@@ um@@ at@@ r@@ a ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke and t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i , I re@@ built Is@@ la@@ mic fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men &apos;s v@@ il@@ la@@ ges ."
"And in 200@@ 8 , in Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u , S@@ ic@@ hu@@ an are@@ a in China , ne@@ arly 7@@ 0,000 people were kill@@ ed , and also esp@@ eci@@ ally many of the sch@@ o@@ ols were de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed because of the cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion between the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and the con@@ trac@@ tor ."
I was asked to re@@ build the te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary ch@@ ur@@ ch .
I b@@ rought my J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students to work with the Chin@@ ese students .
"In one mon@@ th , we comple@@ ted n@@ ine cla@@ ss@@ ro@@ om@@ s , over 5@@ 00 squ@@ are me@@ ters ."
"It &apos;s still used , even after the curr@@ ent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke in China ."
"In 200@@ 9 , in I@@ tal@@ y , L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke ."
"And this is a very interesting phot@@ o : form@@ er P@@ ri@@ me M@@ ini@@ ster B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er P@@ ri@@ me M@@ ini@@ ster M@@ r@@ . A@@ so — you know , because we have to change the pri@@ me min@@ i@@ ster ever year ."
"And they are very kind , aff@@ or@@ ding my model ."
"I pro@@ pos@@ ed a big re@@ building , a te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary music h@@ all , because L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a is very fa@@ mous for music and all the con@@ cer@@ t h@@ all@@ s were de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed , so m@@ usi@@ ci@@ ans were moving out ."
"So I pro@@ pos@@ ed to the ma@@ y@@ or , I &apos;d like to re@@ build the te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ."
"M@@ r@@ . B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i b@@ rought G@@ 8 su@@ mm@@ it , and our form@@ er pri@@ me min@@ i@@ ster came , so they help@@ ed us to coll@@ ect money , and I got half a million e@@ u@@ ro@@ s from the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese government to re@@ build this te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um ."
"@@ Y@@ ear 20@@ 10 in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , there was a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , but it &apos;s imp@@ os@@ sible to f@@ ly over , so I went to S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go , nex@@ t-@@ do@@ or country , to dri@@ ve six hours to get to H@@ a@@ it@@ i with the lo@@ cal students in S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go to build 50 un@@ its of sh@@ el@@ ter out of lo@@ cal p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es ."
"This is what happened in J@@ ap@@ an two years ago , in nor@@ ther@@ n J@@ ap@@ an ."
"A@@ f@@ ter the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke and t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i , people had to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated in a big room like a g@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um ."
But look at this . There &apos;s no pri@@ v@@ acy .
People su@@ ff@@ er m@@ ent@@ ally and phy@@ sically .
"So we went there to build par@@ ti@@ tions with all the stud@@ ent v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es , just a very simple sh@@ el@@ ter out of the tu@@ be fra@@ me and the cur@@ tain ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , some of the fac@@ ility au@@ th@@ or@@ ity doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them ."
But it &apos;s really nec@@ ess@@ ary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough fl@@ at are@@ a to build st@@ and@@ ard government sing@@ le@@ -@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing like this one .
"L@@ oo@@ k at this . E@@ ven ci@@ vi@@ l government is doing such poor con@@ struc@@ tion of the te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing , so den@@ se and so m@@ ess@@ y because there is no stor@@ age , nothing , water is lea@@ king , so I thought , we have to make mul@@ ti@@ -@@ story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very com@@ for@@ table ."
So I pro@@ pos@@ ed to the ma@@ y@@ or while I was making par@@ ti@@ tions .
F@@ in@@ ally I met a very n@@ ice ma@@ y@@ or in O@@ n@@ aga@@ w@@ a v@@ il@@ la@@ ge in M@@ i@@ y@@ ag@@ i .
He asked me to build th@@ ree@@ -@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing on ba@@ se@@ b@@ all &#91; fiel@@ ds &#93; .
"I used the shi@@ pp@@ ing con@@ tain@@ er and also the students help@@ ed us to make all the building f@@ ur@@ n@@ it@@ ure to make them com@@ for@@ table , within the bu@@ d@@ get of the government but also the are@@ a of the house is exactly the same , but much more com@@ for@@ table ."
M@@ any of the people want to st@@ ay here fore@@ ver .
I was very happy to hear that .
"Now I am working in New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"A@@ b@@ out 20 days before the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke happened , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , and many J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students were also kill@@ ed , and the most important ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al of the city , the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch , was t@@ ot@@ ally de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed ."
And I was asked to come to re@@ build the te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al .
So this is under con@@ struc@@ tion .
And I &apos;d like to keep building mon@@ um@@ ents that are b@@ el@@ o@@ ved by people .
Thank you very much .

"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty years ago in the old S@@ o@@ vi@@ et U@@ ni@@ on , a team of engine@@ ers was sec@@ re@@ tly moving a large ob@@ ject through a de@@ sol@@ ate coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
"W@@ ith it , they were hop@@ ing to cap@@ ture the min@@ ds of people every@@ where by being the first to con@@ qu@@ er ou@@ ter space ."
The ro@@ ck@@ et was huge .

"O@@ n O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 4 , 19@@ 5@@ 7 , they la@@ un@@ ched their ro@@ ck@@ et ."
One of the R@@ us@@ si@@ an scientists wr@@ ote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k .
"In the ol@@ den days , expl@@ or@@ ers like V@@ as@@ c@@ o d@@ a G@@ am@@ a and C@@ ol@@ um@@ b@@ us had the good for@@ tun@@ e to open up the ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al g@@ lo@@ be ."
Now we have the good for@@ tun@@ e to open up space .

"It t@@ ells the story of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , and the story of what happened to America as a resul@@ t ."
"For days after the la@@ unch , S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was a wonder@@ ful cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity ."
"A man@@ -@@ made mo@@ on vi@@ sible by ordin@@ ary ci@@ tiz@@ ens , it insp@@ i@@ red a@@ we and pri@@ de that humans had finally la@@ un@@ ched an ob@@ ject into space ."
"But just three days later , on a day they called R@@ ed M@@ on@@ day , the media and the poli@@ tici@@ ans told us , and we beli@@ ev@@ ed , that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was pro@@ of that our ene@@ my had be@@ at@@ en us in science and technology , and that they could now att@@ ack us with hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en b@@ om@@ b@@ s , using their S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k ro@@ ck@@ et as an I@@ B@@ M mi@@ ssi@@ le ."
All h@@ ell bro@@ ke lo@@ ose .
S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k quickly became one of the three great sho@@ cks to h@@ it America — hi@@ st@@ ori@@ ans say the equ@@ al of P@@ ear@@ l H@@ ar@@ b@@ or or 9 / 11 .
It pro@@ vo@@ ked the mi@@ ssi@@ le ga@@ p .
It exp@@ lo@@ ded an ar@@ ms r@@ ace .

And the re@@ ac@@ tions to S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k went far be@@ y@@ on@@ d we@@ ap@@ ons incre@@ ases .

But S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k pro@@ vo@@ ked wonder@@ ful chan@@ ges as well .
"For example , some in this room went to school on sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship because of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k ."
"S@@ u@@ pp@@ ort for engine@@ ering , mat@@ h and science — education in gener@@ al — bo@@ om@@ ed ."
"And V@@ int C@@ er@@ f po@@ in@@ ts out that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k led direc@@ tly to A@@ R@@ P@@ A , and the Internet , and , of course , N@@ A@@ S@@ A ."
My fe@@ ature doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary sho@@ ws how a free society can be st@@ am@@ pe@@ ded by those who know how to use media .
"But it also sho@@ ws how we can turn what appe@@ ar@@ s at first to be a bad situ@@ ation , into something that was over@@ all very good for America ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k &quot; &quot; will so@@ on be re@@ le@@ ased .
"In clos@@ ing , I would like to take a moment to th@@ ank one of my inve@@ st@@ ors : lon@@ g@@ time TE@@ D@@ ster , J@@ ay W@@ al@@ ker ."

I think you &apos;ll ag@@ ree with me that that &apos;s a pretty u@@ se@@ ful public health inter@@ ven@@ tion .
So now just take a min@@ u@@ te .
I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
Why don &apos;t you just sha@@ ke their hands .
P@@ lease sha@@ ke their hands .
"A@@ ll right , get to know each other ."
They look really pretty .
All right .
"So what if I told you that the person wh@@ ose hands you just sh@@ oo@@ k actually didn &apos;t was@@ h their hands when they were coming out of the to@@ i@@ let ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty any@@ more , right ?"
"P@@ re@@ tty y@@ uc@@ k@@ y , you would ag@@ ree with me ."
"Well , st@@ ati@@ sti@@ c@@ s are actually sho@@ wing that four people out of five don &apos;t was@@ h their hands when they come out of the to@@ i@@ let , glob@@ ally ."
"And the same way , we don &apos;t do it when we &apos;ve got f@@ anc@@ y to@@ i@@ le@@ ts , run@@ ning water , and so@@ a@@ p a@@ va@@ il@@ able , it &apos;s the same thing in the countries where child mor@@ tal@@ ity is really high ."
What is it ? I@@ s there no so@@ a@@ p ?

Why ar@@ en &apos;t people wa@@ shing their hands ?
"Wh@@ y is it that Ma@@ y@@ ank , this young bo@@ y that I met in In@@ dia , isn &apos;t wa@@ shing his hands ?"
"Well , in Ma@@ y@@ ank &apos;s family , so@@ a@@ p is used for ba@@ thing , so@@ a@@ p is used for la@@ und@@ ry , so@@ a@@ p is used for wa@@ shing di@@ sh@@ es ."
"H@@ is parents think sometimes it &apos;s a pre@@ ci@@ ous com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cu@@ p@@ bo@@ ard ."
They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t wa@@ st@@ e it .
"O@@ n a@@ verage , in Ma@@ y@@ ank &apos;s family , they will use so@@ a@@ p for wa@@ shing hands once a day at the very best , and sometimes even once a week for wa@@ shing hands with so@@ a@@ p ."
What &apos;s the resul@@ t of that ?
"@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren pic@@ k up disease in the place that &apos;s supp@@ os@@ ed to love them and prot@@ ect them the most , in their h@@ om@@ es ."
Th@@ ink about where you learned to was@@ h your hands .
D@@ id you learn to was@@ h your hands at home ?
D@@ id you learn to was@@ h your hands in school ?
I think behavi@@ or@@ al scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the ha@@ b@@ its that you have had early in life .
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , we all cop@@ y what everyone else does , and lo@@ cal cul@@ tur@@ al nor@@ ms are something that sh@@ ape how we change our behavi@@ or , and this is where the pri@@ v@@ ate sec@@ tor comes in ."
"E@@ very second in A@@ si@@ a and Africa , 1@@ 11 mo@@ thers will bu@@ y this b@@ ar to prot@@ ect their family ."
"M@@ any women in In@@ dia will tell you they learned all about hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , dise@@ ases , from this b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p from L@@ i@@ fe@@ bu@@ o@@ y br@@ and ."
I@@ con@@ ic br@@ ands like this one have a respon@@ si@@ bility to do good in the places where they s@@ ell their produc@@ ts .
"It &apos;s that belie@@ f , pl@@ us the scale of U@@ ni@@ le@@ ver , that allo@@ ws us to keep talking about h@@ and@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ a@@ p and hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e to these mo@@ thers ."
B@@ i@@ g bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es and br@@ ands can change and shi@@ ft those social nor@@ ms and make a difference for those ha@@ b@@ its that are so stu@@ b@@ born .
Th@@ ink about it : Mar@@ ke@@ te@@ ers spend all their time making us s@@ wit@@ ch from one br@@ and to the other .
"And actually , they know how to trans@@ form science and fac@@ ts into comp@@ elling messa@@ ges ."
"@@ J@@ ust for a min@@ u@@ te , imagine when they put all their for@@ ces behind a messa@@ ge as powerful as h@@ and@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ a@@ p ."
The prof@@ it m@@ oti@@ ve is trans@@ form@@ ing health out@@ comes in this world .
But it &apos;s been happening for cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es : the L@@ i@@ fe@@ bu@@ o@@ y br@@ and was la@@ un@@ ched in 18@@ 9@@ 4 in V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ an Eng@@ land to actually com@@ b@@ at ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a .
"L@@ ast week , I was in G@@ h@@ an@@ a with the min@@ i@@ ster of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a out@@ brea@@ k in G@@ h@@ an@@ a at the moment ."
"A hund@@ red and e@@ igh@@ te@@ en years later , the solu@@ tion is exactly the same : It &apos;s about en@@ sur@@ ing that they have ac@@ cess to this b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a from sp@@ read@@ ing ."
"I think this dri@@ ve for prof@@ it is extre@@ me@@ ly powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most comm@@ it@@ ted char@@ ity or government ."
"@@ G@@ o@@ vern@@ ment is doing what they can , esp@@ eci@@ ally in terms of the p@@ an@@ de@@ m@@ ics and ep@@ ide@@ m@@ ics such as ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a , or E@@ b@@ ol@@ a at the moment , but with com@@ pe@@ ting pri@@ ori@@ ties ."
The bu@@ d@@ get is not always there .
"And when you think about this , you think about what is requ@@ i@@ red to make h@@ and@@ wa@@ shing a da@@ i@@ ly ha@@ bit , it requ@@ i@@ res su@@ sta@@ ined fund@@ ing to re@@ f@@ ine this behavi@@ or ."
"In sh@@ ort , those that fi@@ ght for public health are actually dep@@ end@@ ent up@@ on the so@@ a@@ p companies to keep pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing h@@ and@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ a@@ p ."
"We have friends like U@@ S@@ A@@ I@@ D , the G@@ lob@@ al P@@ u@@ bli@@ c@@ -@@ P@@ ri@@ v@@ ate P@@ ar@@ t@@ ner@@ ship for H@@ and@@ wa@@ shing with S@@ o@@ a@@ p , L@@ on@@ don S@@ ch@@ ool of H@@ y@@ gi@@ en@@ e and T@@ ro@@ pi@@ cal M@@ e@@ dic@@ ine , P@@ l@@ an , W@@ at@@ er@@ A@@ id , that all believe for a win@@ -@@ win@@ -@@ w@@ in par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship ."
"W@@ in for the public sec@@ tor , because we help them re@@ ach their t@@ ar@@ gets ."
"W@@ in for the pri@@ v@@ ate sec@@ tor , because we build new gener@@ ations of future h@@ and@@ wa@@ sh@@ ers ."
"And most import@@ antly , w@@ in for the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able ."
"O@@ n O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 15 , we will c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate G@@ lob@@ al H@@ and@@ wa@@ shing D@@ ay ."
"Th@@ ese are simple ob@@ jects : c@@ lo@@ cks , ke@@ ys , com@@ b@@ s , g@@ la@@ ss@@ es ."
They are the things the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de in B@@ os@@ ni@@ a car@@ ri@@ ed with them on their fin@@ al jour@@ ney .
"We are all fami@@ li@@ ar with these m@@ und@@ an@@ e , every@@ day ob@@ jects ."
The fact that some of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms car@@ ri@@ ed pers@@ onal it@@ e@@ ms such as too@@ th@@ pa@@ st@@ e and a too@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h is a cle@@ ar si@@ gn they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
"@@ U@@ su@@ ally , they were told that they were going to be ex@@ changed for pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers of war ."
"Th@@ ese it@@ e@@ ms have been reco@@ vered from num@@ er@@ ous ma@@ ss gra@@ ves across my h@@ om@@ el@@ and , and as we speak , for@@ en@@ sic@@ s are ex@@ hum@@ ing bo@@ dies from ne@@ w@@ ly disco@@ vered ma@@ ss gra@@ ves , 20 years after the war ."
And it is quite pos@@ si@@ bly the lar@@ gest ever disco@@ vered .
"D@@ uring the four years of conf@@ lic@@ t that de@@ va@@ st@@ ated the B@@ os@@ ni@@ an n@@ ation in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s , appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately 3@@ 0,000 ci@@ tiz@@ ens , ma@@ in@@ ly ci@@ vi@@ li@@ ans , went mi@@ ssing , pre@@ su@@ med kill@@ ed , and another 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 were kill@@ ed during com@@ b@@ at oper@@ ations ."
"M@@ ost of them were kill@@ ed either in the early days of the war or to@@ wards the end of the h@@ os@@ ti@@ li@@ ties , when U.@@ N@@ . sa@@ fe z@@ ones like S@@ re@@ br@@ en@@ ic@@ a f@@ ell into the hands of the S@@ er@@ b ar@@ my ."
The inter@@ national cri@@ min@@ al tri@@ b@@ un@@ al deli@@ vered a number of s@@ ent@@ ences for cri@@ m@@ es against human@@ ity and gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de .
"@@ G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is a syste@@ ma@@ tic and deli@@ ber@@ ate de@@ struc@@ tion of a r@@ ac@@ i@@ al , political , reli@@ gi@@ ous or e@@ th@@ n@@ ic group ."
A@@ s much as gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de is about kill@@ ing .
"It is also about de@@ st@@ ro@@ ying their pro@@ per@@ ty , their cul@@ tur@@ al her@@ it@@ age , and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely the very n@@ oti@@ on that they ever ex@@ ist@@ ed ."
G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is not only about the kill@@ ing ; it is about the den@@ i@@ ed identi@@ ty .
There are always trac@@ es — no such thing as a per@@ f@@ ect cri@@ me .
There are always re@@ m@@ n@@ ants of the per@@ i@@ shed ones that are more d@@ ur@@ able than their fra@@ gi@@ le bo@@ dies and our sel@@ ective and f@@ ad@@ ing mem@@ ory of them .
"Th@@ ese it@@ e@@ ms are reco@@ vered from num@@ er@@ ous ma@@ ss gra@@ ves , and the ma@@ in go@@ al of this coll@@ ection of the it@@ e@@ ms is a uni@@ que process of identi@@ f@@ ying those who dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed in the kill@@ ings , the first act of gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de on Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an so@@ il since the H@@ o@@ lo@@ ca@@ ust ."
N@@ ot a single body should re@@ ma@@ in un@@ disco@@ vered or uni@@ d@@ enti@@ fied .
"O@@ n@@ ce reco@@ vered , these it@@ e@@ ms that the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms car@@ ri@@ ed with them on their way to ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion are care@@ fully cle@@ an@@ ed , anal@@ y@@ z@@ ed , ca@@ tal@@ o@@ gu@@ ed and st@@ o@@ red ."
Th@@ ous@@ ands of arti@@ fac@@ ts are p@@ ac@@ ked in wh@@ ite pla@@ stic ba@@ gs just like the ones you see on C@@ S@@ I .
"Th@@ ese ob@@ jects are used as a for@@ en@@ si@@ c too@@ l in vi@@ su@@ al identi@@ fi@@ cation of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , but they are also used as very val@@ u@@ able for@@ en@@ si@@ c evi@@ dence in the on@@ going war cri@@ m@@ es tri@@ als ."
"S@@ ur@@ vi@@ v@@ ors are oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally called to try to identi@@ f@@ y these it@@ e@@ ms phy@@ sically , but physi@@ cal bro@@ w@@ sing is extre@@ me@@ ly difficult , an in@@ eff@@ ective and pa@@ in@@ ful process ."
"O@@ n@@ ce the for@@ en@@ sic@@ s and doc@@ tors and la@@ w@@ y@@ ers are done with these ob@@ jects , they become or@@ ph@@ ans of the n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive ."
"M@@ any of them get de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed , believe it or not , or they get simply sh@@ el@@ ved , out of si@@ ght and out of mind ."
I decided a few years ago to photograp@@ h every single ex@@ hum@@ ed it@@ e@@ m in order to create a vi@@ su@@ al arch@@ i@@ ve that survi@@ v@@ ors could ea@@ si@@ ly bro@@ w@@ se .
"As a stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ er , I like to give back to the community ."
I like to move be@@ y@@ on@@ d ra@@ is@@ ing a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
"And in this case , someone may recogn@@ ize these it@@ e@@ ms or at least their photograp@@ h@@ s will re@@ ma@@ in as a per@@ man@@ ent , un@@ bi@@ ased and ac@@ cur@@ ate re@@ min@@ der of what happened ."
"P@@ h@@ ot@@ ograp@@ h@@ y is about emp@@ a@@ thy , and the fami@@ li@@ ar@@ ity of these it@@ e@@ ms gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e emp@@ a@@ thy ."
"In this case , I am mer@@ ely a too@@ l , a for@@ en@@ si@@ c , if you like , and the resul@@ t is a photograp@@ h@@ y that is as close as possible of being a do@@ cu@@ ment ."
"O@@ n@@ ce all the mi@@ ssing pers@@ ons are identi@@ fied , only deca@@ ying bo@@ dies in their gra@@ ves and these every@@ day it@@ e@@ ms will re@@ ma@@ in ."
"In all their simp@@ li@@ city , these it@@ e@@ ms are the last te@@ sta@@ ment to the identi@@ ty of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , the last per@@ man@@ ent re@@ min@@ der that these people ever ex@@ ist@@ ed ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challen@@ ges .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous before I started my 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challen@@ ges .
It &apos;s aw@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fu@@ n ."
( Applause )
"So in colle@@ ge , I was a government maj@@ or , which means I had to wr@@ ite a lot of p@@ ap@@ ers ."
"Now , when a nor@@ mal stud@@ ent wr@@ it@@ es a p@@ aper , they might sp@@ read the work out a little like this ."
"So , you know — ( Laughter ) you get started maybe a little s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , but you get enough done in the first week that , with some hea@@ vi@@ er days later on , everything gets done , things st@@ ay ci@@ vi@@ l . ( Laughter )@@ "
And I would want to do that like that .
That would be the pl@@ an .
"I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the p@@ aper would come along , and then I would kind of do this ."
( Laughter ) And that would happen every single p@@ aper .
"But then came my 9@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ age sen@@ i@@ or the@@ s@@ is , a p@@ aper you &apos;re supp@@ os@@ ed to spend a year on ."
"And I knew for a p@@ aper like that , my nor@@ mal work f@@ low was not an op@@ tion ."
It was way too big a project .
"So I plan@@ ned things out , and I decided I kind of had to go something like this ."
This is how the year would go .
"So I &apos;d start off light , and I &apos;d b@@ um@@ p it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would k@@ ic@@ k it up into high ge@@ ar just like a little sta@@ ir@@ case ."
How hard could it be to walk up the sta@@ ir@@ s ?
"N@@ o big de@@ al , right ?"
"But then , the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened ."
Th@@ ose first few months ?
"They came and went , and I couldn &apos;t quite do stuff ."
So we had an aw@@ es@@ ome new re@@ vi@@ sed pl@@ an .
"( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then those middle months actually went by , and I didn &apos;t really wr@@ ite words , and so we were here ."
"And then two months turned into one mon@@ th , which turned into two weeks ."
"And one day I w@@ o@@ ke up with three days until the de@@ ad@@ line , still not having wr@@ it@@ ten a word , and so I did the only thing I could : I wr@@ ote 9@@ 0 p@@ ages over 7@@ 2 hours , pul@@ ling not one but two all@@ -@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters — humans are not supp@@ os@@ ed to pul@@ l two all@@ -@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters — sp@@ r@@ in@@ ted across ca@@ mp@@ us , do@@ ve in s@@ low m@@ oti@@ on , and got it in just at the de@@ ad@@ line ."
I thought that was the end of everything .
"But a week later I get a call , and it &apos;s the school ."
"And they say , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this T@@ i@@ m U@@ r@@ b@@ an ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; We need to talk about your the@@ s@@ is . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; It &apos;s the best one we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That did not happen . ( Laughter )
"It was a very , very bad the@@ s@@ is . ( Laughter )@@ "
"I just wanted to en@@ jo@@ y that one moment when all of you thought , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )@@ "
"N@@ o , no , it was very , very bad ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , today I &apos;m a wr@@ it@@ er@@ -@@ blo@@ g@@ ger guy ."
I wr@@ ite the blo@@ g W@@ a@@ it But Why .
"And a couple of years ago , I decided to wr@@ ite about pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ation ."
"M@@ y behavi@@ or has always per@@ p@@ le@@ x@@ ed the non@@ -@@ pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors around me , and I wanted to expla@@ in to the non@@ -@@ pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors of the world what goes on in the hea@@ ds of pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors , and why we are the way we are ."
"Now , I had a hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is that the bra@@ ins of pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors were actually different than the bra@@ ins of other people ."
"And to test this , I found an M@@ R@@ I la@@ b that actually let me s@@ can both my brain and the brain of a pro@@ ven non@@ -@@ pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator , so I could comp@@ are them ."
I actually b@@ rought them here to show you today .
I want you to take a look care@@ fully to see if you can not@@ ice a difference .
"I know that if you &apos;re not a tra@@ ined brain exper@@ t , it &apos;s not that obvi@@ ous , but just take a look , O@@ K ?"
So here &apos;s the brain of a non@@ -@@ pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator .
( Laughter ) Now ...
here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) There is a difference .
"B@@ ot@@ h bra@@ ins have a R@@ ational D@@ eci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ Ma@@ ker in them , but the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator &apos;s brain also has an In@@ st@@ ant G@@ ra@@ ti@@ fi@@ cation M@@ on@@ key ."
"Now , what does this mean for the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator ?"
"Well , it means everything &apos;s f@@ ine until this happens ."
"@@ &#91; This is a per@@ f@@ ect time to get some work done . &#93; &#91; N@@ op@@ e ! &#93; So the R@@ ational D@@ eci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ Ma@@ ker will make the ra@@ tional deci@@ sion to do something produc@@ tive , but the M@@ on@@ key doesn &apos;t like that pl@@ an , so he actually takes the whe@@ el , and he says , &quot; &quot; A@@ c@@ tually , let &apos;s read the entire W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia p@@ age of the N@@ anc@@ y K@@ er@@ ri@@ g@@ an / T@@ on@@ y@@ a H@@ ar@@ ding sc@@ and@@ al , because I just re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed that that happened ."
"( Laughter ) Th@@ en — ( Laughter ) Th@@ en we &apos;re going to go over to the fri@@ dge , to see if there &apos;s anything new in there since 10 minutes ago ."
"A@@ f@@ ter that , we &apos;re going to go on a Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be sp@@ ir@@ al that star@@ ts with vide@@ os of R@@ ic@@ hard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man talking about ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ts and ends much , much later with us wat@@ ching inter@@ vi@@ e@@ ws with J@@ us@@ ti@@ n B@@ i@@ e@@ ber &apos;s mo@@ m ."
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; All of that &apos;s going to take a while , so we &apos;re not going to really have room on the sch@@ edu@@ le for any work today ."
"S@@ or@@ ry ! &quot; &quot; ( S@@ i@@ gh ) Now , what is going on here ?"
The In@@ st@@ ant G@@ ra@@ ti@@ fi@@ cation M@@ on@@ key does not see@@ m like a guy you want behind the whe@@ el .
He lives enti@@ re@@ ly in the pres@@ ent moment .
"He has no mem@@ ory of the past , no knowle@@ dge of the future , and he only car@@ es about two things : easy and fu@@ n ."
"Now , in the an@@ ima@@ l world , that works f@@ ine ."
"If you &apos;re a do@@ g and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fu@@ n things , you &apos;re a huge suc@@ cess !@@ "
"( Laughter ) And to the M@@ on@@ key , humans are just another an@@ ima@@ l species ."
"You have to keep w@@ ell@@ -@@ s@@ le@@ pt , w@@ ell@@ -@@ f@@ ed and pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ating into the next gener@@ ation , which in tri@@ b@@ al times might have worked O@@ K ."
"But , if you ha@@ ven &apos;t not@@ ic@@ ed , now we &apos;re not in tri@@ b@@ al times ."
"We &apos;re in an adv@@ anc@@ ed ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , and the M@@ on@@ key does not know what that is ."
"Wh@@ ich is why we have another guy in our brain , the R@@ ational D@@ eci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ Ma@@ ker , who gi@@ ves us the ability to do things no other an@@ ima@@ l can do ."
We can vi@@ su@@ al@@ ize the future .
We can see the big picture .
We can make lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m pl@@ ans .
And he wan@@ ts to take all of that into ac@@ coun@@ t .
And he wan@@ ts to just have us do wh@@ ate@@ ver makes sense to be doing right now .
"Now , sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fu@@ n , like when you &apos;re having din@@ ner or going to bed or en@@ jo@@ ying w@@ ell@@ -@@ ear@@ ned le@@ is@@ ure time ."
That &apos;s why there &apos;s an over@@ la@@ p .
S@@ ome@@ times they ag@@ ree .
"But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are har@@ der and less p@@ le@@ as@@ ant , for the sa@@ ke of the big picture ."
And that &apos;s when we have a conf@@ lic@@ t .
"And for the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator , that conf@@ lic@@ t ten@@ ds to end a certain way every time , lea@@ ving him sp@@ ending a lot of time in this or@@ an@@ ge z@@ one , an easy and fu@@ n place that &apos;s enti@@ re@@ ly out of the Ma@@ kes S@@ en@@ se cir@@ cle ."
I call it the D@@ ark P@@ la@@ y@@ ground .
"( Laughter ) Now , the D@@ ark P@@ la@@ y@@ ground is a place that all of you pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors out there know very well ."
It &apos;s where le@@ is@@ ure acti@@ vi@@ ties happen at times when le@@ is@@ ure acti@@ vi@@ ties are not supp@@ os@@ ed to be happening .
"The fu@@ n you have in the D@@ ark P@@ la@@ y@@ ground isn &apos;t actually fu@@ n , because it &apos;s completely u@@ ne@@ ar@@ ned , and the air is f@@ ill@@ ed with gu@@ il@@ t , dre@@ ad , an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , self-@@ h@@ at@@ red — all of those good pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator feel@@ ings ."
"And the question is , in this situ@@ ation , with the M@@ on@@ key behind the whe@@ el , how does the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator ever get hi@@ m@@ self over here to this bl@@ ue z@@ one , a less p@@ le@@ as@@ ant place , but where really important things happen ?"
"Well , turns out the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator has a gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an an@@ ge@@ l , someone who &apos;s always looking down on him and wat@@ ching over him in his d@@ ar@@ ke@@ st mom@@ ents — someone called the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster ."
"( Laughter ) Now , the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster is d@@ or@@ m@@ ant most of the time , but he su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly wa@@ kes up any@@ time a de@@ ad@@ line gets too close or there &apos;s d@@ an@@ ger of public em@@ bar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ment , a care@@ er di@@ sa@@ ster or some other sc@@ ary con@@ sequ@@ ence ."
"And import@@ antly , he &apos;s the only thing the M@@ on@@ key is ter@@ ri@@ fied of ."
"Now , he became very re@@ le@@ v@@ ant in my life pretty rec@@ ently , because the people of TED re@@ ach@@ ed out to me about six months ago and inv@@ ited me to do a TED T@@ al@@ k ."
"( Laughter ) Now , of course , I said y@@ es ."
It &apos;s always been a dre@@ am of m@@ ine to have done a TED T@@ al@@ k in the past .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the middle of all this exc@@ it@@ e@@ ment , the R@@ ational D@@ eci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ Ma@@ ker se@@ em@@ ed to have something else on his mind ."
"He was saying , &quot; &quot; A@@ re we cle@@ ar on what we just ac@@ cep@@ ted ?"
D@@ o we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
"We need to s@@ it down and work on this right now . &quot; &quot; And the M@@ on@@ key said , &quot; &quot; T@@ ot@@ ally ag@@ ree , but let &apos;s just open Goo@@ gle Earth and z@@ oo@@ m in to the bot@@ to@@ m of In@@ dia , like 200 fe@@ et ab@@ o@@ ve the ground , and sc@@ ro@@ ll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country , so we can get a better feel for In@@ dia . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what we did that day . ( Laughter )@@ "
"As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to re@@ lease the spea@@ kers ."
"And I op@@ en@@ ed up the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , and there was my face star@@ ing right back at me ."
And gu@@ ess who w@@ o@@ ke up ?
"( Laughter ) So the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster star@@ ts l@@ os@@ ing his mind , and a few secon@@ ds later , the whole system &apos;s in ma@@ y@@ he@@ m . ( Laughter )@@ "
"And the M@@ on@@ key — remember , he &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ fied of the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster — boo@@ m , he &apos;s up the t@@ ree !@@ "
"And finally , finally , the R@@ ational D@@ eci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ Ma@@ ker can take the whe@@ el and I can start working on the talk ."
"Now , the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster expla@@ ins all kinds of pretty in@@ s@@ an@@ e pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator behavi@@ or , like how someone like me could spend two weeks un@@ able to start the op@@ ening s@@ ent@@ ence of a p@@ aper , and then m@@ ir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously find the un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able work e@@ th@@ ic to st@@ ay up all night and wr@@ ite e@@ ight p@@ ages ."
"And this entire situ@@ ation , with the three char@@ ac@@ ters — this is the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator &apos;s system ."
"It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works ."
This is what I decided to wr@@ ite about on the blo@@ g a couple of years ago .
"When I did , I was ama@@ z@@ ed by the respon@@ se ."
"L@@ it@@ er@@ ally thousands of e@@ ma@@ il@@ s came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things ."
"Th@@ ese are people who were n@@ ur@@ ses , ban@@ kers , pa@@ inter@@ s , engine@@ ers and lots and lots of P@@ h@@ D students ."
"( Laughter ) And they were all wr@@ iting , saying the same thing : &quot; I have this problem too . &quot;"
But what struc@@ k me was the con@@ tra@@ st between the light t@@ one of the p@@ ost and the hea@@ v@@ iness of these e@@ ma@@ il@@ s .
"Th@@ ese people were wr@@ iting with in@@ ten@@ se f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion about what pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ation had done to their lives , about what this M@@ on@@ key had done to them ."
"And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?"
Why are all of these people in such a d@@ ark place ?
"Well , it turns out that there &apos;s two kinds of pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ation ."
"E@@ very@@ thing I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about today , the exa@@ mp@@ les I &apos;ve given , they all have de@@ ad@@ l@@ ines ."
"And when there &apos;s de@@ ad@@ l@@ ines , the eff@@ ects of pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ation are con@@ ta@@ ined to the sh@@ ort ter@@ m because the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster gets inv@@ olved ."
But there &apos;s a second kind of pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ation that happens in situ@@ ations when there is no de@@ ad@@ line .
"So if you wanted a care@@ er where you &apos;re a self-@@ star@@ ter — something in the ar@@ ts , something ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ u@@ ri@@ al — there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ l@@ ines on those things at first , because nothing &apos;s happening , not until you &apos;ve g@@ one out and done the hard work to get mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m , get things going ."
"There &apos;s also all kinds of important things outside of your care@@ er that don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve any de@@ ad@@ l@@ ines , like seeing your family or ex@@ er@@ ci@@ sing and taking care of your health , working on your relation@@ ship or getting out of a relation@@ ship that isn &apos;t working ."
"Now if the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator &apos;s only m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism of doing these hard things is the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster , that &apos;s a problem , because in all of these non@@ -@@ de@@ ad@@ line situ@@ ations , the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster doesn &apos;t show up ."
"He has nothing to wa@@ ke up for , so the eff@@ ects of pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ation , they &apos;re not con@@ ta@@ ined ; they just ex@@ t@@ end ou@@ tw@@ ard fore@@ ver ."
"And it &apos;s this lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m kind of pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ation that &apos;s much less vi@@ sible and much less tal@@ ked about than the fun@@ ni@@ er , sh@@ ort@@ -@@ ter@@ m de@@ ad@@ l@@ in@@ e-@@ based kind ."
It &apos;s u@@ su@@ ally su@@ ff@@ ered qu@@ i@@ e@@ tly and pri@@ v@@ ately .
"And it can be the source of a huge amount of lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m un@@ happ@@ iness , and re@@ gre@@ ts ."
"And I thought , that &apos;s why those people are e@@ ma@@ il@@ ing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place ."
It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cra@@ mm@@ ing for some project .
"It &apos;s that lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ation has made them feel like a spec@@ t@@ ator , at times , in their own lives ."
The f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion is not that they couldn &apos;t ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve their dre@@ a@@ ms ; it &apos;s that they wer@@ en &apos;t even able to start cha@@ sing them .
So I read these e@@ ma@@ il@@ s and I had a little bit of an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any — that I don &apos;t think non@@ -@@ pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors ex@@ ist .

"Now , I want to show you one last thing ."
I call this a L@@ i@@ fe C@@ al@@ end@@ ar .
That &apos;s one box for every week of a 9@@ 0@@ -@@ year life .
"That &apos;s not that many bo@@ x@@ es , esp@@ eci@@ ally since we &apos;ve already used a b@@ unch of those ."
"So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that cal@@ end@@ ar ."
"We need to think about what we &apos;re really pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ating on , because everyone is pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ating on something in life ."
We need to st@@ ay aw@@ are of the In@@ st@@ ant G@@ ra@@ ti@@ fi@@ cation M@@ on@@ key .
That &apos;s a job for all of us .

"Well , maybe not today , but ..@@ ."
( Laughter ) You know .

"There &apos;s a man by the name of C@@ ap@@ tain W@@ illi@@ am S@@ w@@ en@@ son who rec@@ ently was a@@ war@@ ded the con@@ gre@@ ssi@@ onal M@@ ed@@ al of H@@ on@@ or for his ac@@ tions on S@@ ep@@ te@@ m@@ ber 8 , 200@@ 9 ."
"O@@ n that day , a col@@ um@@ n of American and A@@ f@@ g@@ ha@@ n t@@ ro@@ op@@ s were making their way through a part of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an to help prot@@ ect a group of government off@@ ici@@ als , a group of A@@ f@@ g@@ ha@@ n government off@@ ici@@ als , who would be me@@ e@@ ting with some lo@@ cal v@@ il@@ la@@ ge el@@ ders ."
"The col@@ um@@ n came under am@@ bus@@ h , and was sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded on three si@@ des , and am@@ on@@ g@@ st many other things , C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son was recogn@@ ized for run@@ ning into live fir@@ e to re@@ sc@@ ue the w@@ oun@@ ded and pul@@ l out the de@@ ad ."
"One of the people he re@@ sc@@ u@@ ed was a ser@@ ge@@ ant , and he and a com@@ ra@@ de were making their way to a me@@ de@@ va@@ c he@@ li@@ cop@@ ter ."
"And what was re@@ mark@@ able about this day is , by sh@@ e@@ er co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence , one of the me@@ de@@ va@@ c medi@@ c@@ s happened to have a G@@ o@@ P@@ r@@ o camer@@ a on his hel@@ met and cap@@ tu@@ red the whole sc@@ en@@ e on camer@@ a ."
It sho@@ ws C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son and his com@@ ra@@ de br@@ ing@@ ing this w@@ oun@@ ded sol@@ di@@ er who had re@@ cei@@ ved a g@@ un@@ sho@@ t to the nec@@ k .
"They put him in the he@@ li@@ cop@@ ter , and then you see C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son b@@ end over and give him a k@@ is@@ s before he turns around to re@@ sc@@ ue more ."
"I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?"
"What is that ? That is some de@@ ep , de@@ ep emoti@@ on , when you would want to do that ."
"There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?"
"You know , in the mil@@ it@@ ary , they give me@@ d@@ als to people who are w@@ ill@@ ing to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice themselves so that others may ga@@ in ."
"In business , we give b@@ on@@ uses to people who are w@@ ill@@ ing to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice others so that we may ga@@ in ."
We have it b@@ ack@@ wards . R@@ ight ?
"So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?"
And my ini@@ ti@@ al con@@ clu@@ sion was that they &apos;re just better people .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re at@@ trac@@ ted to the mil@@ it@@ ary .
These better people are at@@ trac@@ ted to this con@@ cept of serv@@ ice .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
"What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the cap@@ ac@@ ity to do these re@@ mark@@ able things , and more import@@ antly , others have that cap@@ ac@@ ity too ."
"I &apos;ve had the great hon@@ or of getting to me@@ et some of these , who we would call her@@ o@@ es , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to sa@@ ve others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?"
"The problem with con@@ cep@@ ts of tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation is that they are feel@@ ings , they are not in@@ struc@@ tions ."
"I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; T@@ r@@ ust me , &quot; &quot; and you will ."
"I can &apos;t simply in@@ struc@@ t two people to co@@ oper@@ ate , and they will ."
It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feel@@ ing .
So where does that feel@@ ing come from ?
"If you go back 5@@ 0,000 years to the P@@ al@@ e@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic er@@ a , to the early days of H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , what we find is that the world was f@@ ill@@ ed with d@@ an@@ ger , all of these for@@ ces working very , very hard to k@@ ill us ."
N@@ o@@ thing pers@@ onal .
"Wh@@ e@@ ther it was the w@@ ea@@ ther , l@@ ack of re@@ sources , maybe a s@@ ab@@ er@@ -@@ too@@ th@@ ed ti@@ ger , all of these things working to re@@ duce our li@@ f@@ esp@@ an ."
"And so we ev@@ olved into social animals , where we li@@ ved together and worked together in what I call a cir@@ cle of sa@@ fe@@ ty , inside the tri@@ be , where we felt like we b@@ el@@ on@@ ged ."
"And when we felt sa@@ fe am@@ on@@ g@@ st our own , the natural re@@ action was tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation ."
There are in@@ her@@ ent b@@ ene@@ f@@ its to this .
It means I can f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep at night and tr@@ ust that someone from within my tri@@ be will wat@@ ch for d@@ an@@ ger .
B@@ ad system of survi@@ v@@ al .
The mo@@ der@@ n day is exactly the same thing .
"The world is f@@ ill@@ ed with d@@ an@@ ger , things that are trying to f@@ ru@@ str@@ ate our lives or re@@ duce our suc@@ cess , re@@ duce our opport@@ unity for suc@@ cess ."
"It could be the u@@ ps and do@@ w@@ ns in the econom@@ y , the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of the st@@ o@@ ck market ."
It could be a new technology that r@@ end@@ ers your business model ob@@ so@@ le@@ te over@@ night .
O@@ r it could be your com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion that is sometimes trying to k@@ ill you .
"It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very min@@ im@@ um is working hard to f@@ ru@@ str@@ ate your gro@@ w@@ th and ste@@ al your business from you ."
We have no control over these for@@ ces .
"Th@@ ese are a con@@ st@@ ant , and they &apos;re not going away ."
"The only vari@@ able are the condi@@ tions inside the organ@@ ization , and that &apos;s where lead@@ er@@ ship mat@@ ters , because it &apos;s the lead@@ er that se@@ ts the t@@ one ."
"When a lead@@ er makes the cho@@ ice to put the sa@@ fe@@ ty and lives of the people inside the organ@@ ization first , to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice their com@@ for@@ ts and s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice the t@@ an@@ gi@@ ble resul@@ ts , so that the people re@@ ma@@ in and feel sa@@ fe and feel like they b@@ el@@ ong , re@@ mark@@ able things happen ."
"I was fl@@ ying on a tri@@ p , and I was wit@@ ness to an in@@ ci@@ dent where a pas@@ sen@@ ger at@@ te@@ mp@@ ted to bo@@ ard before their number was called , and I wat@@ ched the g@@ ate ag@@ ent tre@@ at this man like he had bro@@ ken the la@@ w , like a cri@@ min@@ al ."
He was y@@ ell@@ ed at for at@@ te@@ mp@@ ting to bo@@ ard one group too so@@ on .
So I said something .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have tre@@ at us like ca@@ t@@ tle ?"
Why can &apos;t you tre@@ at us like human be@@ ings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ ir , if I don &apos;t fol@@ low the r@@ ules , I could get in tr@@ ou@@ ble or l@@ ose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel sa@@ fe . All she was telling me is th@@ at@@ "
she doesn &apos;t tr@@ ust her lead@@ ers .
The reason we like fl@@ ying S@@ ou@@ th@@ we@@ st A@@ ir@@ l@@ ines is not because they nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly h@@ ire better people .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t f@@ ear their lead@@ ers .
"You see , if the condi@@ tions are wrong , we are for@@ c@@ ed to exp@@ end our own time and energy to prot@@ ect ourselves from each other , and that in@@ her@@ ently w@@ ea@@ k@@ ens the organ@@ ization ."
"When we feel sa@@ fe inside the organ@@ ization , we will nat@@ ur@@ ally com@@ b@@ ine our tal@@ ents and our str@@ eng@@ ths and work ti@@ re@@ le@@ ss@@ ly to face the d@@ ang@@ ers outside and se@@ ize the opport@@ uni@@ ties ."
"The clos@@ est anal@@ o@@ gy I can give to what a great lead@@ er is , is like being a par@@ ent ."
"If you think about what being a great par@@ ent is , what do you want ? What makes a great par@@ ent ?"
"We want to give our child opport@@ uni@@ ties , education , di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine them when nec@@ ess@@ ary , all so that they can grow up and ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve more than we could for ourselves ."
G@@ re@@ at lead@@ ers want exactly the same thing .
"They want to provi@@ de their people opport@@ unity , education , di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine when nec@@ ess@@ ary , build their self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dence , give them the opport@@ unity to try and fa@@ il , all so that they could ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves ."
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e K@@ i@@ m , who &apos;s the C@@ E@@ O of a company called N@@ ext J@@ um@@ p in New York C@@ ity , a t@@ ec@@ h company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consi@@ der la@@ ying off one of your children ?"
We would never do it .
Th@@ en why do we consi@@ der la@@ ying off people inside our organ@@ ization ?
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e imp@@ le@@ men@@ ted a poli@@ cy of li@@ fe@@ time emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .
"If you get a job at N@@ ext J@@ um@@ p , you cannot get fi@@ red for per@@ form@@ ance issu@@ es ."
It &apos;s the comple@@ te op@@ pos@@ ite .
"This is the reason so many people have such a vi@@ sc@@ er@@ al h@@ at@@ red , an@@ ger , at some of these ban@@ king C@@ E@@ O@@ s with their dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies and b@@ on@@ us struc@@ tures ."
It &apos;s not the numbers .
It &apos;s that they have viol@@ ated the very defin@@ ition of lead@@ er@@ ship .
They have viol@@ ated this de@@ ep@@ -@@ se@@ ated social con@@ tr@@ act .
"This is what so off@@ ends us , not the numbers ."
W@@ ould any@@ body be off@@ en@@ ded if we gave a $ 1@@ 50 million b@@ on@@ us to G@@ and@@ h@@ i ?
How about a $ 2@@ 50 million b@@ on@@ us to M@@ other T@@ er@@ es@@ a ?
D@@ o we have an issu@@ e with that ? N@@ one at all . N@@ one at all .
G@@ re@@ at lead@@ ers would never s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice
the people to sa@@ ve the numbers .
They would so@@ on@@ er s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice the numbers to sa@@ ve the people .
"Now in a large man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing company , this is a big de@@ al , and they could no longer aff@@ ord their l@@ ab@@ or p@@ ool ."
"They needed to sa@@ ve 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the bo@@ ard got together and di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed la@@ y@@ off@@ s ."
And B@@ o@@ b re@@ f@@ used .
"You see , B@@ o@@ b doesn &apos;t believe in head coun@@ ts ."
"B@@ o@@ b beli@@ ev@@ es in heart coun@@ ts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply re@@ duce the heart coun@@ t ."
And so they came up with a f@@ ur@@ l@@ ough progra@@ m .
"E@@ very emp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ e , from sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary to C@@ E@@ O , was requ@@ i@@ red to take four weeks of un@@ pa@@ id va@@ cation ."
"They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it con@@ sec@@ u@@ ti@@ vely ."
"He said , it &apos;s better that we should all su@@ ff@@ er a little than any of us should have to su@@ ff@@ er a lot , and mor@@ ale went up ."
"They sa@@ ved 20 million dollars , and most import@@ antly , as would be exp@@ ected , when the people feel sa@@ fe and prot@@ ected by the lead@@ er@@ ship in the organ@@ ization , the natural re@@ action is to tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ate ."
"And quite sp@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously , no@@ body exp@@ ected , people started tra@@ ding with each other ."
Th@@ ose who could aff@@ ord it more would tra@@ de with those who could aff@@ ord it less .
People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
L@@ ea@@ der@@ ship is a cho@@ ice . It is not a r@@ ank .
I know many people at the sen@@ i@@ or@@ most le@@ vel@@ s of organ@@ iz@@ ations who are ab@@ solu@@ tely not lead@@ ers .
"And I know many people who are at the bot@@ tom@@ s of organ@@ iz@@ ations who have no au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and they are ab@@ solu@@ tely lead@@ ers , and this is because they have ch@@ os@@ en to look after the person to the left of them , and they have ch@@ os@@ en to look after the person to the right of them ."
This is what a lead@@ er is .
"I heard a story of some Mar@@ ines who were out in the@@ ater , and as is the Mar@@ ine cu@@ st@@ om , the off@@ ic@@ er ate last , and he let his men e@@ at first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him ."
"And when they went back out in the field , his men b@@ rought him some of their food so that he may e@@ at , because that &apos;s what happens ."
We call them lead@@ ers because they go first .
We call them lead@@ ers because they take the risk before any@@ body else does .
"They will give us their bloo@@ d and s@@ we@@ at and t@@ ear@@ s to see that their lead@@ er &apos;s vi@@ sion comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?"
Why would you give your bloo@@ d and s@@ we@@ at and t@@ ear@@ s for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
Thank you very much .

"The most comple@@ x problems in our time can be sol@@ ved with simple tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es , if we are able to dre@@ am ."
"As a child , I disco@@ vered that cre@@ ati@@ vity is the key to c@@ ross from dre@@ a@@ ms to reality ."
"I learned this from my gr@@ and@@ mother , D@@ r@@ . R@@ u@@ th T@@ ic@@ ha@@ u@@ er , a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e that se@@ t@@ t@@ led in the heart of the An@@ des ."

"So part of my education inclu@@ ded help@@ ing her in re@@ m@@ ote , in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous communi@@ ties ."

"D@@ uring those tri@@ ps , my gr@@ and@@ mother used to rec@@ ite a K@@ i@@ pl@@ ing po@@ e@@ m : &quot; &quot; S@@ ome@@ thing hi@@ dd@@ en . G@@ o and find it ."
G@@ o and look behind the M@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins .
S@@ ome@@ thing lost behind the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins .
"L@@ ost and wa@@ iting for you . G@@ o ! &quot; &quot; In the coming years , I became a medi@@ cal stud@@ ent ."
One of every hund@@ red children born wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de has some kind of heart disease .
There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can solve — the part of this problem I have spent my life working on .
The problem star@@ ts during pre@@ gn@@ anc@@ y .
The fe@@ tu@@ s needs to survi@@ ve inside the mother .
"A@@ t the moment of bir@@ th , this communi@@ cation needs to stop ."
"If it doesn &apos;t close , the bab@@ y has a h@@ ole in the heart ."
It is ca@@ used by pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ity and gen@@ e@@ tic condi@@ tions .
But what we know today is that a l@@ ack of o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en is also one of the ca@@ uses .
"As you can see in the ch@@ art , the f@@ requ@@ enc@@ y of this kind of h@@ ole dra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally incre@@ ases with al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de ."
"@@ V@@ ide@@ o : ( B@@ ab@@ y cr@@ ying ) Wh@@ en you look at patients with this condi@@ tion , they see@@ m de@@ s@@ per@@ ate to brea@@ the ."
"T@@ o close the h@@ ole , maj@@ or sur@@ g@@ ery used to be the only solu@@ tion ."
"One night , my friend M@@ al@@ te , were ca@@ mp@@ ing in the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on regi@@ on ."
Th@@ en came a moment of insp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion .
So we used the br@@ an@@ ch as a mo@@ ld for our first inv@@ en@@ tion .
The hol@@ es in children &apos;s hear@@ ts can be clos@@ ed with it .
A co@@ il is a piece of w@@ ire wr@@ app@@ ed on@@ to itself .
"It maybe doesn &apos;t look so f@@ anc@@ y to you now , but that was our first suc@@ cess@@ ful at@@ te@@ mp@@ t to create a dev@@ ice for this maj@@ or problem ."
"In this video , we can see how a very tin@@ y ca@@ the@@ ter takes the co@@ il to the heart ."
The co@@ il then clos@@ es the h@@ ole .
"A@@ f@@ ter that moment of insp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion , there came a very long time of eff@@ ort develop@@ ing a prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e ."
In v@@ it@@ r@@ o and in vi@@ v@@ o stu@@ dies took thousands of hours of work in the la@@ b .
"I re@@ turned from G@@ er@@ many to B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ a , thinking that wh@@ er@@ ever we go , we have the opport@@ unity to make a difference ."
"W@@ ith my wi@@ fe and par@@ t@@ ner , D@@ r@@ . A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ r@@ a H@@ e@@ ath , we started to see patients ."
"A@@ f@@ ter suc@@ cess@@ fully tre@@ ating patients with our co@@ il , we felt really en@@ th@@ usi@@ as@@ tic ."
"But we live in a place that is 1@@ 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et high ."
"And , the patients there need a speci@@ al dev@@ ice to solve their heart condi@@ tion ."
"M@@ ost patients cannot aff@@ ord to be tre@@ ated on time , and they di@@ e ."
The first co@@ il could suc@@ cess@@ fully tre@@ at only half of the patients in B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ a .
The search started again .
We went back to the dra@@ wing bo@@ ard .
"A@@ f@@ ter many tri@@ als , and with the help of my gr@@ and@@ mother &apos;s in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous friends in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins , we ob@@ ta@@ ined a new dev@@ ice ."
"For cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es , in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous women told stories by w@@ ea@@ ving comple@@ x pat@@ ter@@ ns on lo@@ om@@ s , and an u@@ nex@@ p@@ ected sk@@ ill help@@ ed us for the new dev@@ ice ."
"It see@@ ms this time , the w@@ ea@@ ving allo@@ ws us to create a se@@ am@@ less dev@@ ice that doesn &apos;t r@@ ust because it &apos;s made of only one piece ."
It can change by itself into very comple@@ x struc@@ tures by a pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure that took deca@@ des to devel@@ op .
"As you can see , the dev@@ ice en@@ ters the body through the natural chan@@ n@@ els ."
D@@ oc@@ tors have only to close the ca@@ the@@ ter through the h@@ ole .
"O@@ ur dev@@ ice exp@@ ands , places itself and clos@@ es the h@@ ole ."
We have this beautiful deli@@ very system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .
No open sur@@ g@@ ery was nec@@ ess@@ ary .
"( Applause ) A@@ s doc@@ tors , we fi@@ ght with dise@@ ases that take a long time and eff@@ ort to he@@ al — if they do ."
"This is the child from before , after the pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure ."
"As you can see — ( Applause ) A@@ s you can see , once the dev@@ ice is in place , the pati@@ ent is 100 percent heal@@ ed ."
"F@@ rom start to fin@@ ish , the whole pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure takes only 30 minutes ."
That &apos;s very re@@ war@@ ding from the medi@@ cal and human point of view .
"We are so p@@ rou@@ d that some of our form@@ er patients are part of our team — a team , th@@ an@@ ks to ad@@ ded close inter@@ action with patients that work with us ."
"T@@ o@@ gether , we have only one idea : the best solu@@ tions need to be simple ."
We lost the f@@ ear of cre@@ ating something new .
"The p@@ ath , it &apos;s not easy ."
M@@ any ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les ari@@ se all the time .
But we re@@ cei@@ ve str@@ eng@@ th from our patients .
"O@@ ur go@@ al is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or ac@@ cess ."
So we have to start a f@@ ound@@ ation with a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one model .
We will give one dev@@ ice for free to make sure that every child is tre@@ ated .
"This whole thing began with one imp@@ os@@ sible idea as will contin@@ ue it , really : No child is left behind ."

"So I gre@@ w up in L@@ imp@@ op@@ o , on the bor@@ der of L@@ imp@@ op@@ o and M@@ p@@ um@@ al@@ ang@@ a , a little to@@ wn called M@@ ot@@ e@@ te@@ m@@ a ."
"W@@ ater and electri@@ city supp@@ ly are as un@@ predic@@ table as the w@@ ea@@ ther , and gro@@ wing up in these t@@ ough situ@@ ations , at the age of 1@@ 7 , I was rela@@ x@@ ing with a couple of friends of m@@ ine in win@@ ter , and we were s@@ un@@ ba@@ thing ."
The L@@ imp@@ op@@ o su@@ n gets really h@@ ot in win@@ ter .
"So as we were s@@ un@@ ba@@ thing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , why doesn &apos;t somebody inv@@ ent something that you can just put on your sk@@ in and then you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ? &quot; &quot; And I s@@ at , and I was like , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , I would bu@@ y that , e@@ h ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very sho@@ c@@ king st@@ ati@@ sti@@ c@@ s ."
O@@ ver 2@@ .@@ 5 billion people in the world today do not have pro@@ per ac@@ cess to water and s@@ an@@ it@@ ation .
"F@@ our hund@@ red and fi@@ f@@ ty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in S@@ outh Africa ."
"@@ V@@ ari@@ ous dise@@ ases th@@ ri@@ ve in this environment , the most dra@@ stic of which is called tr@@ ach@@ om@@ a ."
T@@ r@@ ach@@ om@@ a is an inf@@ ection of the ey@@ e du@@ e to di@@ r@@ t getting into your ey@@ e . M@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple inf@@ ec@@ tions of tr@@ ach@@ om@@ a can leave you per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ ind .
"The disease lea@@ ves e@@ ight million people per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ ind each and every year . The sho@@ c@@ king part about it is that to a@@ vo@@ id being inf@@ ected with tr@@ ach@@ om@@ a , all you have to do is was@@ h your face : no medi@@ c@@ ine , no p@@ ill@@ s , no in@@ j@@ ec@@ tions ."
"So after seeing these sho@@ c@@ king st@@ ati@@ sti@@ c@@ s , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to ba@@ the , I at least need to do it to try to sa@@ ve the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my tru@@ st@@ y little ste@@ ed , my N@@ o@@ ki@@ a 6@@ 2@@ 3@@ 4 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a l@@ ap@@ top , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , ex@@ cept for the 20@@ -@@ r@@ and@@ -@@ an@@ -@@ h@@ our Internet ca@@ fe — I did research on W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia , on Goo@@ gle , about l@@ oti@@ ons , cre@@ a@@ ms , the comp@@ os@@ i@@ tions , the m@@ el@@ ting po@@ in@@ ts , the to@@ x@@ ici@@ ties — I did high school science — and I wr@@ ote down a little form@@ ul@@ a on a piece of p@@ aper ,@@ "
"@@ and it looked like the K@@ F@@ C speci@@ al sp@@ ice , you know ?"

It &apos;s actually a@@ va@@ il@@ able on the market ."
So we learned a few le@@ ss@@ ons in comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al@@ iz@@ ing and making D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath a@@ va@@ il@@ able .
One of the things we learned was that poor communi@@ ties don &apos;t bu@@ y produc@@ ts in b@@ ul@@ k .
"They bu@@ y produc@@ ts on de@@ m@@ and . A person in A@@ le@@ x doesn &apos;t bu@@ y a box of ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ t@@ es . They bu@@ y one ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ te each day , even though it &apos;s more exp@@ en@@ sive ."
So we p@@ ack@@ ag@@ ed D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath in these inno@@ v@@ ative little s@@ ac@@ he@@ ts .
"You just s@@ na@@ p them in half , and you squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze it out ."
"And the c@@ ool part is , one s@@ ach@@ et sub@@ stitu@@ t@@ es one b@@ ath for five r@@ and ."
"A@@ f@@ ter cre@@ ating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting the produc@@ t ."
We realized that even ri@@ ch kids from the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s really want D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath . ( Laughter ) A@@ t least once a week .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , we realized that we could sa@@ ve 80 million lit@@ ers of water on a@@ verage each time they s@@ ki@@ pp@@ ed a b@@ ath , and also we would sa@@ ve two hours a day for kids who are in r@@ ural are@@ as , two hours more for school , two hours more for h@@ ome@@ work , two hours more to just be a k@@ id ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seeing that global imp@@ act , we n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wed it down to our key val@@ ue pro@@ pos@@ ition , which was cle@@ an@@ l@@ iness and con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence ."
D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath is a ri@@ ch man &apos;s con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence and a poor man &apos;s li@@ f@@ es@@ a@@ ver .
"H@@ a@@ ving put the produc@@ t into pr@@ acti@@ ce , we are actually now on the ver@@ ge of sel@@ ling the produc@@ t on@@ to a mul@@ tin@@ ational to take it to the re@@ ta@@ il market , and one question I have for the au@@ di@@ ence today is , on the gra@@ vel ro@@ a@@ ds of L@@ imp@@ op@@ o , with an allo@@ w@@ ance of 50 r@@ and a week , I came up with a way for the world not to ba@@ the ."
What &apos;s st@@ opp@@ ing you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
"And another key thing that I learned a lot throu@@ gh@@ out this whole process , last year Goo@@ gle nam@@ ed me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young min@@ ds in the world ."
"I &apos;m also curr@@ ently the best stud@@ ent ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur in the world , the first Afri@@ can to get that ac@@ co@@ la@@ de , and one thing that really pu@@ z@@ z@@ les me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to ba@@ the . Thank you ."
( Applause . )
"F@@ i@@ ve years ago , I was on a s@@ ab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal , and I re@@ turned to the medi@@ cal univer@@ sity where I stu@@ died ."
"I saw real patients and I wor@@ e the wh@@ ite co@@ at for the first time in 1@@ 7 years , in fact since I became a man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment con@@ sul@@ t@@ ant ."
There were two things that surpri@@ sed me during the mon@@ th I spent .
"The first one was that the common the@@ me of the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions we had were h@@ osp@@ ital bu@@ d@@ gets and cos@@ t-@@ cu@@ tting , and the second thing , which really bo@@ ther@@ ed me , actually , was that se@@ ver@@ al of the colle@@ ag@@ ues I met , form@@ er friends from medi@@ cal school , who I knew to be some of the smar@@ test , most m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated , eng@@ ag@@ ed and pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cy@@ ni@@ cal , dis@@ eng@@ ag@@ ed , or had dist@@ anc@@ ed themselves from h@@ osp@@ ital man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment ."
"So with this foc@@ us on cos@@ t-@@ cu@@ tting , I asked myself , are we for@@ getting the pati@@ ent ?"
M@@ any countries that you re@@ pres@@ ent and where I come from str@@ ug@@ gle with the cost of heal@@ th@@ care .
It &apos;s a big part of the national bu@@ d@@ gets .
And many different re@@ for@@ ms ai@@ m at hol@@ ding back this gro@@ w@@ th .
"In some countries , we have long wa@@ iting times for patients for sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"In other countries , new dru@@ gs are not being re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , and ther@@ e@@ fore don &apos;t re@@ ach patients ."
"In se@@ ver@@ al countries , doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses are the t@@ ar@@ gets , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , for the govern@@ ments ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , the cos@@ tly deci@@ sions in health care are taken by doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses ."
"You cho@@ ose an exp@@ en@@ sive la@@ b test , you cho@@ ose to oper@@ ate on an old and fra@@ il pati@@ ent ."
"So , by lim@@ iting the de@@ gre@@ es of f@@ ree@@ dom of physi@@ ci@@ ans , this is a way to h@@ old cos@@ ts down ."
"And ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , some physi@@ ci@@ ans will say today that they don &apos;t have the full li@@ ber@@ ty to make the cho@@ ices they think are right for their patients ."
So no won@@ der that some of my old colle@@ ag@@ ues are f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated .
"A@@ t B@@ C@@ G , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of man@@ ag@@ ing heal@@ th@@ care ."
"And so we took a ste@@ p back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve ? &quot;"
"@@ U@@ l@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , in the heal@@ th@@ care system , we &apos;re a@@ im@@ ing at im@@ pro@@ ving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a lim@@ ited , or aff@@ or@@ d@@ able , cost ."
We call this val@@ u@@ e-@@ based heal@@ th@@ care .
"O@@ n the scre@@ en behind me , you see what we mean by val@@ ue : out@@ comes that matter to patients rela@@ tive to the money we spend ."
This was descri@@ bed beauti@@ fully in a book in 200@@ 6 by M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter and E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th T@@ e@@ is@@ ber@@ g .
"O@@ n this picture , you have my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by his three beautiful d@@ augh@@ ters ."
"When we started doing our research at B@@ C@@ G , we decided not to look so much at the cos@@ ts , but to look at the qu@@ ality instead , and in the research , one of the things that f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated us was the vari@@ ation we saw ."
"You comp@@ are h@@ osp@@ it@@ als in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extre@@ me@@ ly good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are va@@ st@@ ly much wor@@ se ."
The differ@@ ences were dra@@ ma@@ tic .
"E@@ ri@@ k , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w , he su@@ ff@@ ers from pr@@ os@@ t@@ ate cancer , and he probably needs sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"Now living in Eu@@ rop@@ e , he can cho@@ ose to go to G@@ er@@ many that has a w@@ ell@@ -@@ re@@ pu@@ ted heal@@ th@@ care system ."
"If he goes there and goes to the a@@ verage h@@ osp@@ ital , he will have the risk of be@@ coming in@@ contin@@ ent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start w@@ ear@@ ing di@@ ap@@ ers again ."
You f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in . F@@ i@@ f@@ ty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
"If he instead would go to H@@ am@@ bur@@ g , and to a cl@@ in@@ ic called the Mar@@ t@@ ini@@ -@@ K@@ l@@ ini@@ k , the risk would be only one in 20 ."
"E@@ i@@ ther you a f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in , or you have a one in 20 risk ."
"That &apos;s a huge difference , a se@@ ven@@ -@@ fo@@ ld difference ."
"When we look at many h@@ osp@@ it@@ als for many different dise@@ ases , we see these huge differ@@ ences ."
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
"And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist ."
N@@ o@@ body kno@@ ws .
So going the h@@ osp@@ ital is a l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope ."
"In the l@@ ate &apos; 7@@ 0s , there were a group of S@@ we@@ dis@@ h or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons who met at their an@@ n@@ u@@ al me@@ e@@ ting , and they were di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing the different pro@@ ce@@ du@@ res they used to oper@@ ate hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"T@@ o the left of this sli@@ de , you see a vari@@ ety of me@@ t@@ al piec@@ es , arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al hi@@ ps that you would use for somebody who needs a new hi@@ p ."
They all realized they had their individu@@ al way of oper@@ ating .
"They all ar@@ gu@@ ed that , &quot; &quot; My tech@@ ni@@ que is the best , &quot; &quot; but n@@ one of them actually knew , and they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that ."
"So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to meas@@ ure qu@@ ality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years de@@ b@@ ating , &quot; So what is qu@@ ality in hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery ? &quot;"
"@@ &quot; O@@ h , we should meas@@ ure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should meas@@ ure that . &quot;"
And they finally ag@@ re@@ ed .
"And once they had ag@@ re@@ ed , they started meas@@ uring , and started shar@@ ing the data ."
"@@ V@@ ery quickly , they found that if you put ce@@ ment in the b@@ one of the pati@@ ent before you put the me@@ t@@ al sha@@ ft in , it actually la@@ sted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on in their li@@ fe@@ time ."
"They publi@@ shed the data , and it actually trans@@ form@@ ed cl@@ ini@@ cal pr@@ acti@@ ce in the country ."
E@@ very@@ body saw this makes a lot of sense .
"S@@ ince then , they publi@@ sh every year ."
"O@@ n@@ ce a year , they publi@@ sh the le@@ ag@@ ue table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bot@@ to@@ m ?"
"And they vi@@ s@@ it each other to try to learn , so a contin@@ u@@ ous cy@@ cle of im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ment ."
"For many years , S@@ we@@ dis@@ h hi@@ p sur@@ ge@@ ons had the best resul@@ ts in the world , at least for those who actually were meas@@ uring , and many were not ."
Now I found this prin@@ ci@@ ple really exc@@ iting .
"So the physi@@ ci@@ ans get together , they ag@@ ree on what qu@@ ality is , they start meas@@ uring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it ."
Con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ment .
"Now , that &apos;s not the only exc@@ iting part ."
That &apos;s exc@@ iting in itself .
"But if you bring back the cost side of the equ@@ ation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have foc@@ used on qu@@ ality , they actually also have the lo@@ we@@ st cos@@ ts , al@@ though that &apos;s not been the pur@@ p@@ ose in the first place ."
"So if you look at the hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they com@@ par@@ ed the U.@@ S@@ . and S@@ we@@ den ."
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on seven years after the first sur@@ g@@ ery .
"In the United States , the number was three times high@@ er than in S@@ we@@ den ."
"So many un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary sur@@ g@@ er@@ ies , and so much un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary su@@ ff@@ ering for all the patients who were oper@@ ated on in that seven year per@@ i@@ od ."
"Now , you can imagine how much sa@@ v@@ ings there would be for society ."
We did a study where we looked at O@@ E@@ C@@ D data .
"O@@ E@@ C@@ D does , every so often , look at qu@@ ality of care where they can find the data across the member countries ."
"The United States has , for many dise@@ ases , actually a qu@@ ality which is b@@ el@@ ow the a@@ verage in O@@ E@@ C@@ D ."
"Now , if the American heal@@ th@@ care system would foc@@ us a lot more on meas@@ uring qu@@ ality , and ra@@ ise qu@@ ality just to the level of a@@ verage O@@ E@@ C@@ D , it would sa@@ ve the American people 5@@ 00 billion U.@@ S@@ . dollars a year ."
"That &apos;s 20 percent of the bu@@ d@@ get , of the heal@@ th@@ care bu@@ d@@ get of the country ."
"Now you may say that these numbers are f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?"
"This would be a par@@ a@@ di@@ g@@ m shi@@ ft in heal@@ th@@ care , and I would ar@@ gu@@ e that not only can it be done , but it has to be done ."
The ag@@ ents of change are the doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses in the heal@@ th@@ care system .
"In my pr@@ acti@@ ce as a con@@ sul@@ t@@ ant , I me@@ et probably a hund@@ red or more than a hund@@ red doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses and other h@@ osp@@ ital or heal@@ th@@ care st@@ af@@ f every year ."
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve in terms of qu@@ ality for their patients .
"P@@ hy@@ si@@ ci@@ ans are , like most of you in the au@@ di@@ ence , very com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive ."
They were always best in cla@@ ss .
We were always best in cla@@ ss .
"And if somebody can show them that the resul@@ t they per@@ form for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do wh@@ ate@@ ver it takes to im@@ pro@@ ve ."
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physi@@ ci@@ ans have another char@@ acter@@ is@@ tic .
They actually th@@ ri@@ ve from pe@@ er recogn@@ ition .
"If a car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ st call@@ s another car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ st in a com@@ pe@@ ting h@@ osp@@ ital and di@@ sc@@ us@@ ses why that other h@@ osp@@ ital has so much better resul@@ ts , they will share ."
They will share the information on how to im@@ pro@@ ve .
"So it is , by meas@@ uring and cre@@ ating transp@@ ar@@ enc@@ y , you get a cy@@ cle of contin@@ u@@ ous im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ment , which is what this sli@@ de sho@@ ws ."
"Now , you may say this is a n@@ ice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea ."
This is happening in reality .
"We &apos;re cre@@ ating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to meas@@ ure and comp@@ are what we ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve ."
"T@@ o@@ gether with two a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic in@@ stitu@@ tions , M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ iness S@@ ch@@ ool , and the K@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a In@@ stitu@@ te in S@@ we@@ den , B@@ C@@ G has form@@ ed something we call I@@ C@@ H@@ O@@ M ."
"You may think that &apos;s a s@@ nee@@ ze , but it &apos;s not a s@@ nee@@ ze , it &apos;s an ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m ."
It st@@ ands for the Inter@@ national Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um for H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ ut@@ come M@@ e@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ ment .
"We &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing together lead@@ ing physi@@ ci@@ ans and patients to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s , disease by disease , what is really qu@@ ality , what should we meas@@ ure , and to make those st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds global ."
"They &apos;ve worked — four working grou@@ ps have worked during the past year : ca@@ t@@ ar@@ ac@@ ts , back pa@@ in , cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y disease , which is , for inst@@ ance , heart att@@ ack , and pr@@ os@@ t@@ ate cancer ."
The four grou@@ ps will publi@@ sh their data in N@@ o@@ ve@@ m@@ ber of this year .
"That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be com@@ par@@ ing ap@@ pl@@ es to ap@@ pl@@ es , not only within a country , but between countries ."
"N@@ ext year , we &apos;re plan@@ ning to do e@@ ight dise@@ ases , the year after , 1@@ 6 ."
"In three years &apos; time , we pl@@ an to have co@@ vered 40 percent of the disease bur@@ den ."
C@@ om@@ p@@ are ap@@ pl@@ es to ap@@ pl@@ es . Wh@@ o &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
"F@@ i@@ ve months ago , I led a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p at the lar@@ gest univer@@ sity h@@ osp@@ ital in Nor@@ ther@@ n Eu@@ rop@@ e ."
"They have a new C@@ E@@ O , and she has a vi@@ sion : I want to man@@ age my big in@@ stitu@@ tion much more on qu@@ ality , out@@ comes that matter to patients ."
"This particular day , we s@@ at in a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p together with physi@@ ci@@ ans , n@@ ur@@ ses and other st@@ af@@ f , di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing le@@ u@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children ."
"The group di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed , how do we meas@@ ure qu@@ ality today ?"
C@@ an we meas@@ ure it better than we do ?
"We di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed , how do we tre@@ at these kids , what are important im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ments ?"
"And we di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed what are the cos@@ ts for these patients , can we do tre@@ at@@ ment more eff@@ ici@@ ently ?"
There was an en@@ or@@ mous energy in the room .
"There were so many ideas , so much en@@ th@@ usi@@ as@@ m ."
"A@@ t the end of the me@@ e@@ ting , the cha@@ ir@@ man of the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment , he st@@ ood up ."
"He looked over the group and he said — first he ra@@ is@@ ed his hand , I for@@ got that — he ra@@ is@@ ed his hand , cl@@ en@@ ched his fi@@ st , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
"Th@@ ank you . T@@ o@@ day , we &apos;re finally di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing what this h@@ osp@@ ital does the right way . &quot; &quot; B@@ y meas@@ uring val@@ ue in heal@@ th@@ care , that is not only cos@@ ts but out@@ comes that matter to patients , we will make st@@ af@@ f in h@@ osp@@ it@@ als and el@@ se@@ where in the heal@@ th@@ care system not a problem but an important part of the solu@@ tion ."
"I believe meas@@ uring val@@ ue in heal@@ th@@ care will bring about a re@@ v@@ olution , and I &apos;m conv@@ inc@@ ed that the f@@ oun@@ der of mo@@ der@@ n medi@@ c@@ ine , the G@@ ree@@ k H@@ i@@ p@@ po@@ cr@@ ates , who always put the pati@@ ent at the cen@@ ter , he would s@@ mi@@ le in his gra@@ ve ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"I &apos;m really exc@@ ited to share with you some fin@@ d@@ ings that really surpri@@ se me about what makes companies suc@@ ce@@ ed the most , what fac@@ tors actually matter the most for star@@ tu@@ p suc@@ cess ."
I believe that the star@@ tu@@ p organ@@ ization is one of the gre@@ ate@@ st for@@ ms to make the world a better place .
"If you take a group of people with the right equ@@ ity inc@@ enti@@ ves and organ@@ ize them in a star@@ tu@@ p , you can un@@ lo@@ ck human pot@@ ential in a way never before possible ."
You get them to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able things .
"But if the star@@ tu@@ p organ@@ ization is so great , why do so many fa@@ il ?"
That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
I wanted to find out what actually mat@@ ters most for star@@ tu@@ p suc@@ cess .
"And I wanted to try to be syste@@ ma@@ tic about it , a@@ vo@@ id some of my inst@@ inc@@ ts and maybe mis@@ per@@ cep@@ tions I have from so many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years ."
"I wanted to know this because I &apos;ve been star@@ ting bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es since I was 12 years old when I so@@ ld can@@ dy at the b@@ us stop in j@@ uni@@ or high school , to high school , when I made so@@ lar energy dev@@ ices , to colle@@ ge , when I made l@@ ou@@ d@@ spea@@ kers ."
"And when I gra@@ du@@ ated from colle@@ ge , I started so@@ f@@ tw@@ are companies ."
"And 20 years ago , I started I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b , and in the last 20 years , we started more than 100 companies , many suc@@ cess@@ es , and many big fa@@ il@@ u@@ res ."
We learned a lot from those fa@@ il@@ u@@ res .
So I tried to look across what fac@@ tors ac@@ coun@@ ted the most for company suc@@ cess and fa@@ il@@ ure .
So I looked at these five .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the idea ."
I used to think that the idea was everything .
I nam@@ ed my company I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b for how much I wor@@ ship the &quot; &quot; a@@ h@@ a ! &quot; &quot; moment when you first come up with the idea .
"But then over time , I came to think that maybe the team , the ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion , ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ability , that mat@@ ter@@ ed even more than the idea ."
"I never thought I &apos;d be quot@@ ing bo@@ x@@ er M@@ i@@ ke T@@ y@@ son on the TED st@@ age , but he once said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ body has a pl@@ an , until they get p@@ un@@ ched in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well ."
So much about a team &apos;s ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion is its ability to ad@@ ap@@ t to getting p@@ un@@ ched in the face by the cu@@ st@@ om@@ er .
The cu@@ st@@ om@@ er is the true reality .
And that &apos;s why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing .
Th@@ en I started looking at the business model .
D@@ o@@ es the company have a very cle@@ ar p@@ ath gener@@ ating cu@@ st@@ om@@ er re@@ ven@@ ues ?
That started ris@@ ing to the top in my thinking about maybe what mat@@ ter@@ ed most for suc@@ cess .
Th@@ en I looked at the fund@@ ing .
S@@ ome@@ times companies re@@ cei@@ ved in@@ ten@@ se amoun@@ ts of fund@@ ing .
Ma@@ ybe that &apos;s the most important thing ?
"And then of course , the tim@@ ing ."
I@@ s the idea way too early and the world &apos;s not ready for it ?
"I@@ s it early , as in , you &apos;re in adv@@ ance and you have to edu@@ cate the world ?"
I@@ s it just right ?
"O@@ r is it too l@@ ate , and there &apos;s already too many com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tors ?"
So I tried to look very care@@ fully at these five fac@@ tors across many companies .
"And I looked across all 100 I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies , and 100 non@@ -@@ I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies to try and come up with something scienti@@ fic about it ."
"So first , on these I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies , the top five companies — C@@ it@@ y@@ search , C@@ ar@@ s@@ D@@ i@@ rec@@ t , G@@ o@@ T@@ o , N@@ et@@ Z@@ er@@ o , T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m — those all became b@@ illi@@ on@@ -@@ dol@@ lar suc@@ cess@@ es ."
"And the five companies on the bot@@ to@@ m — Z@@ .@@ co@@ m , In@@ si@@ der P@@ ages , M@@ y@@ L@@ i@@ fe , D@@ es@@ k@@ top F@@ ac@@ t@@ ory , Pe@@ op@@ l@@ el@@ ink — we all had high hop@@ es for , but didn &apos;t suc@@ ce@@ ed ."
So I tried to r@@ ank across all of those at@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ es how I felt those companies s@@ co@@ red on each of those di@@ men@@ sions .
"And then for non@@ -@@ I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies , I looked at wi@@ ld suc@@ cess@@ es , like A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b and In@@ st@@ ag@@ ra@@ m and U@@ ber and Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be and L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In ."
"And some fa@@ il@@ u@@ res : W@@ e@@ b@@ v@@ an , K@@ o@@ z@@ m@@ o , P@@ et@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m F@@ loo@@ z and F@@ ri@@ end@@ ster ."
"The bot@@ to@@ m companies had in@@ ten@@ se fund@@ ing , they even had business mo@@ d@@ els in some ca@@ ses , but they didn &apos;t suc@@ ce@@ ed ."
"I tried to look at what fac@@ tors actually ac@@ coun@@ ted the most for suc@@ cess and fa@@ il@@ ure across all of these companies , and the resul@@ ts really surpri@@ sed me ."
The number one thing was tim@@ ing .
T@@ im@@ ing ac@@ coun@@ ted for 4@@ 2 percent of the difference between suc@@ cess and fa@@ il@@ ure .
"T@@ ea@@ m and ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion came in second , and the idea , the differ@@ enti@@ ability of the idea , the uni@@ qu@@ en@@ ess of the idea , that actually came in third ."
"Now , this isn &apos;t ab@@ solu@@ tely defin@@ i@@ tive , it &apos;s not to say that the idea isn &apos;t important , but it very much surpri@@ sed me that the idea wasn &apos;t the most important thing ."
S@@ ome@@ times it mat@@ ter@@ ed more when it was actually tim@@ ed .
"The last two , business model and fund@@ ing , made sense to me actually ."
I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and ad@@ d one later if your cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are de@@ man@@ ding what you &apos;re cre@@ ating .
"And fund@@ ing , I think as well , if you &apos;re under@@ fund@@ ed at first but you &apos;re ga@@ ining tr@@ action , esp@@ eci@@ ally in today &apos;s age , it &apos;s very , very easy to get in@@ ten@@ se fund@@ ing ."
So now let me give you some speci@@ fic exa@@ mp@@ les about each of these .
So take a wi@@ ld suc@@ cess like A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b that everybody kno@@ ws about .
"Well , that company was fa@@ m@@ ously pas@@ sed on by many smar@@ t inve@@ st@@ ors because people thought , &quot; No one &apos;s going to r@@ ent out a space in their home to a str@@ an@@ ger . &quot;"
"O@@ f course , people pro@@ ved that wrong ."
"But one of the reas@@ ons it suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ded , a@@ side from a good business model , a good idea , great ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion , is the tim@@ ing ."
"That company came out right during the he@@ ight of the rec@@ es@@ sion when people really needed ex@@ tr@@ a money , and that maybe help@@ ed people over@@ come their ob@@ j@@ ection to r@@ en@@ ting out their own home to a str@@ an@@ ger ."
S@@ a@@ me thing with U@@ ber .
"@@ U@@ ber came out , incredi@@ ble company , incredi@@ ble business model , great ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion , too ."
But the tim@@ ing was so per@@ f@@ ect for their need to get dri@@ ver@@ s into the system .
"D@@ ri@@ ver@@ s were looking for ex@@ tr@@ a money ; it was very , very important ."
"S@@ ome of our early suc@@ cess@@ es , C@@ it@@ y@@ search , came out when people needed we@@ b p@@ ages ."
"@@ G@@ o@@ T@@ o@@ .@@ co@@ m , which we an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ed actually at TED in 199@@ 8 , was when companies were looking for cos@@ t-@@ eff@@ ective ways to get tra@@ ff@@ ic ."
"We thought the idea was so great , but actually , the tim@@ ing was probably maybe more important ."
And then some of our fa@@ il@@ u@@ res .
"We started a company called Z@@ .@@ co@@ m , it was an on@@ line en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment company ."
"We were so exc@@ ited about it — we ra@@ is@@ ed enough money , we had a great business model , we even sign@@ ed incredi@@ bly great H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ ood tal@@ ent to jo@@ in the company ."
But bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and p@@ ene@@ tra@@ tion was too low in 199@@ 9@@ -@@ 2@@ 000 .

The day I left home for the first time to go to univer@@ sity was a b@@ right day bri@@ mm@@ ing with hope and op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m .
"I &apos;d done well at school . E@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions for me were high , and I g@@ le@@ e@@ fully en@@ ter@@ ed the stud@@ ent life of l@@ ec@@ tures , par@@ ties and tra@@ ff@@ ic c@@ one the@@ ft ."
"Now appe@@ ar@@ anc@@ es , of course , can be dec@@ ep@@ tive , and to an ex@@ t@@ ent , this fe@@ ist@@ y , ener@@ ge@@ tic pers@@ on@@ a of l@@ ec@@ tu@@ re@@ -@@ going and tra@@ ff@@ ic c@@ one ste@@ al@@ ing was a v@@ ene@@ er , al@@ be@@ it a very w@@ ell@@ -@@ cra@@ f@@ ted and conv@@ inc@@ ing one ."
"@@ Un@@ der@@ ne@@ ath , I was actually de@@ ep@@ ly un@@ happy , in@@ sec@@ ure and fundam@@ ent@@ ally fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of other people , of the future , of fa@@ il@@ ure and of the emp@@ t@@ iness that I felt was within me ."
"I was lea@@ ving a se@@ min@@ ar when it started , hum@@ m@@ ing to myself , fu@@ m@@ bl@@ ing with my ba@@ g just as I &apos;d done a hund@@ red times before , when su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I heard a vo@@ ice cal@@ m@@ ly ob@@ ser@@ ve , &quot; She is lea@@ ving the room . &quot;"
"I looked around , and there was no one there , but the cl@@ ar@@ ity and deci@@ si@@ ven@@ ess of the com@@ ment was un@@ mi@@ sta@@ k@@ able ."
&quot; She is op@@ ening the do@@ or . &quot;
This was the begin@@ ning . The vo@@ ice had ar@@ ri@@ ved .
"And the vo@@ ice per@@ sist@@ ed , days and then weeks of it , on and on , n@@ ar@@ r@@ ating everything I did in the third person ."
&quot; She is going to a l@@ ec@@ ture . &quot;
"It was ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al , imp@@ as@@ sive and even , after a while , str@@ an@@ ge@@ ly compan@@ i@@ on@@ ate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , al@@ though I did not@@ ice that its cal@@ m ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or sometimes sli@@ pp@@ ed and that it oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally m@@ ir@@ ro@@ red my own u@@ nex@@ pre@@ ssed emoti@@ on ."
"So , for example , if I was an@@ gr@@ y and had to hi@@ de it , which I often did , being very a@@ dep@@ t at con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing how I really felt , then the vo@@ ice would sound f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated ."
"Now it was then that I made a f@@ at@@ al mi@@ sta@@ ke , in that I told a friend about the vo@@ ice , and she was hor@@ ri@@ fied ."
"A sub@@ tle condi@@ tion@@ ing process had be@@ gu@@ n , the imp@@ li@@ cation that nor@@ mal people don &apos;t hear vo@@ ices and the fact that I did me@@ ant that something was very ser@@ i@@ ously wrong ."
I spent some time telling the colle@@ ge G@@ .@@ P@@ .
"And to be fa@@ ir , I was de@@ s@@ per@@ ate for inter@@ est and help , and I began to tell him about my str@@ an@@ ge comm@@ ent@@ ator ."
"For example , I was part of a stud@@ ent T@@ V st@@ ation that bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st news b@@ ul@@ le@@ t@@ ins around the ca@@ mp@@ us , and during an ap@@ po@@ int@@ ment which was run@@ ning very l@@ ate , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , doc@@ tor , I &apos;ve got to go ."
It was at this point that ev@@ ents began to r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly over@@ take me .
"A h@@ osp@@ ital ad@@ mis@@ sion follo@@ wed , the first of many , a di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ en@@ ia came next , and then , wor@@ st of all , a to@@ x@@ ic , t@@ or@@ men@@ ting sense of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation and de@@ sp@@ air about myself and my pr@@ osp@@ ects ."
"But having been enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged to see the vo@@ ice not as an experience but as a sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m , my f@@ ear and re@@ sist@@ ance to@@ wards it in@@ ten@@ si@@ fied ."
"Now ess@@ enti@@ ally , this re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted taking an ag@@ gre@@ ssi@@ ve st@@ ance to@@ wards my own mind , a kind of p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ic ci@@ vi@@ l war , and in turn this ca@@ used the number of vo@@ ices to incre@@ ase and grow pro@@ gre@@ ssi@@ vely h@@ os@@ ti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing ."
You see that g@@ la@@ ss of water ?
"In eff@@ ect , a v@@ ici@@ ous cy@@ cle of f@@ ear , a@@ vo@@ id@@ ance , mi@@ str@@ ust and mis@@ underst@@ anding had been est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed , and this was a b@@ at@@ tle in which I felt power@@ less and in@@ cap@@ able of est@@ ab@@ li@@ shing any kind of pe@@ ace or re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ."
"T@@ w@@ o years later , and the de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ation was dra@@ ma@@ tic ."
"B@@ y now , I had the whole f@@ r@@ en@@ z@@ i@@ ed re@@ per@@ to@@ ire : ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying vo@@ ices , gr@@ ot@@ es@@ que vi@@ sions , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , in@@ trac@@ table d@@ el@@ usi@@ ons ."
"Now looking back on the w@@ rec@@ k@@ age and de@@ sp@@ air of those years , it see@@ ms to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was sa@@ ved ."
"A bro@@ ken and ha@@ un@@ ted person began that jour@@ ney , but the person who e@@ mer@@ ged was a survi@@ v@@ or and would ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely grow into the person I was de@@ st@@ ined to be ."
"M@@ any people have har@@ med me in my life , and I remember them all , but the mem@@ or@@ ies grow p@@ ale and fa@@ int in com@@ par@@ is@@ on with the people who &apos;ve help@@ ed me ."
I believe that E@@ le@@ an@@ or can get through this .
"S@@ ome@@ times , you know , it s@@ no@@ ws as l@@ ate as M@@ ay , but su@@ mm@@ er always comes ev@@ en@@ tually . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ te@@ en minutes is not enough time to fully cre@@ d@@ it those good and gener@@ ous people who f@@ ou@@ ght with me and for me and who wa@@ ited to w@@ el@@ come me back from that ag@@ on@@ ized , lon@@ ely place ."
"Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the vo@@ ices appe@@ ar@@ ed so h@@ os@@ ti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing , so in this resp@@ ect , a v@@ ital first ste@@ p was learning to se@@ par@@ ate out a me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ori@@ cal me@@ an@@ ing from what I &apos;d pre@@ vi@@ ously inter@@ pre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al tru@@ th ."
"So for example , vo@@ ices which thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to att@@ ack my home I learned to inter@@ pre@@ t as my own sense of f@@ ear and in@@ sec@@ ur@@ ity in the world , rather than an ac@@ tual , ob@@ j@@ ective d@@ an@@ ger ."
"Now at first , I would have beli@@ ev@@ ed them ."
"I remember , for example , sit@@ ting up one night on gu@@ ard outside my parents &apos; room to prot@@ ect them from what I thought was a gen@@ u@@ ine thre@@ at from the vo@@ ices ."
"It was like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t m@@ ess with me ."
"I &apos;ve got a pla@@ stic for@@ k , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ate@@ gi@@ c ."
"But a later respon@@ se , and much more u@@ se@@ ful , would be to try and d@@ econ@@ struc@@ t the messa@@ ge behind the words , so when the vo@@ ices war@@ ned me not to leave the house , then I would th@@ ank them for dra@@ wing my atten@@ tion to how un@@ sa@@ fe I felt — because if I was aw@@ are of it , then I could do something pos@@ i@@ tive about it — but go on to reas@@ sure both them and myself that we were sa@@ fe and didn &apos;t need to feel fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed any@@ more ."
"It was ar@@ med with this knowle@@ dge that ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely I would ga@@ ther together my sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed self , each fra@@ g@@ ment re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted by a different vo@@ ice , gra@@ du@@ ally with@@ dra@@ w from all my medi@@ cation , and re@@ turn to p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ry , only this time from the other side ."
"I &apos;m now very p@@ rou@@ d to be a part of Inter@@ vo@@ ice , the organ@@ iz@@ ational body of the Inter@@ national H@@ ear@@ ing V@@ o@@ ices M@@ o@@ ve@@ ment , an ini@@ ti@@ ative insp@@ i@@ red by the work of P@@ ro@@ f@@ ess@@ or M@@ ari@@ us R@@ om@@ me and D@@ r@@ .

I &apos;m here to share my photograp@@ h@@ y .
O@@ r is it photograp@@ h@@ y ?
"Because , of course , this is a photograp@@ h that you can &apos;t take with your camer@@ a ."
"@@ Y@@ et , my inter@@ est in photograp@@ h@@ y started as I got my first di@@ g@@ ital camer@@ a at the age of 15 ."
"It mi@@ x@@ ed with my ear@@ li@@ er pas@@ sion for dra@@ wing , but it was a bit different , because using the camer@@ a , the process was in the plan@@ ning instead ."
"And when you take a photograp@@ h with a camer@@ a , the process ends when you pre@@ ss the tri@@ g@@ ger ."
So to me it felt like photograp@@ h@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like any@@ one could do that .
"So I wanted to create something different , something where the process star@@ ts when you pre@@ ss the tri@@ g@@ ger ."
P@@ h@@ ot@@ os like this : con@@ struc@@ tion going on along a bus@@ y ro@@ ad .
But it has an u@@ nex@@ p@@ ected tw@@ ist .
"And de@@ sp@@ ite that , it re@@ ta@@ ins a level of real@@ ism ."
"O@@ r phot@@ os like these — both d@@ ark and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common go@@ al of re@@ ta@@ ining the level of real@@ ism ."
"When I say real@@ ism , I mean phot@@ o@@ -@@ real@@ ism ."
"Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tu@@ red some@@ how as a photograp@@ h ."
P@@ h@@ ot@@ os where you will need a bri@@ e@@ f moment to think to figure out the tri@@ ck .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea than about cap@@ tur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the tri@@ ck that makes it look real@@ is@@ tic ?
I@@ s it something about the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s or the col@@ ors ?
I@@ s it something about the light ?
What cre@@ ates the ill@@ u@@ sion ?
S@@ ome@@ times the per@@ spec@@ tive is the ill@@ u@@ sion .
"But in the end , it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a tw@@ o@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal sur@@ face ."
"It &apos;s not really what is real@@ is@@ tic , it &apos;s what we think looks real@@ is@@ tic really ."
So I think the ba@@ sic@@ s are quite simple .
I just see it as a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of reality where you can take different piec@@ es of reality and put it together to create al@@ ter@@ n@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
"H@@ ere we have three per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly ima@@ gin@@ able physi@@ cal ob@@ jects , something we all can re@@ l@@ ate to living in a th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal world ."
"But com@@ b@@ ined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal , like it could ex@@ ist ."
"But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t ."
"So we tri@@ ck our bra@@ ins , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t ac@@ cept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense ."
And I see the same process with com@@ b@@ ining photograp@@ h@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about com@@ b@@ ining different real@@ i@@ ties .
"So the things that make a photograp@@ h look real@@ is@@ tic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our da@@ i@@ ly lives ."
"But when com@@ b@@ ining photograp@@ h@@ s , this is really important to consi@@ der , because o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se it just looks wrong some@@ how ."
So I would like to say that there are three simple r@@ ules to fol@@ low to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve a real@@ is@@ tic resul@@ t .
"As you can see , these images ar@@ en &apos;t really speci@@ al ."
"But com@@ b@@ ined , they can create something like this ."
So the first ru@@ le is that phot@@ os com@@ b@@ ined should have the same per@@ spec@@ tive .
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , phot@@ os com@@ b@@ ined should have the same typ@@ e of light ."
And these two images both ful@@ f@@ ill these two requ@@ i@@ re@@ ments — sho@@ t at the same he@@ ight and in the same typ@@ e of light .
The third one is about making it imp@@ os@@ sible to dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish where the different images beg@@ in and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
Ma@@ ke it imp@@ os@@ sible to say how the image actually was comp@@ os@@ ed .
"So by mat@@ ching col@@ or , con@@ tra@@ st and bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photograp@@ hi@@ c de@@ f@@ ects like dep@@ th of field , de@@ s@@ at@@ ur@@ ated col@@ ors and no@@ ise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , de@@ sp@@ ite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hund@@ reds of la@@ y@@ ers basically ."
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape and the lo@@ wer part is what &apos;s man@@ i@@ pul@@ ated .
But this image is actually enti@@ re@@ ly comp@@ os@@ ed of photograp@@ h@@ s from different lo@@ ca@@ tions .
"I pers@@ on@@ ally think that it &apos;s ea@@ si@@ er to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to comp@@ r@@ om@@ ise with the ideas in your head ."
But it does requ@@ ire a lot of plan@@ ning .
"And getting this idea during win@@ ter , I knew that I had se@@ ver@@ al months to pl@@ an it , to find the different lo@@ ca@@ tions for the piec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le basically ."
"So for example , the fish was cap@@ tu@@ red on a fi@@ shing tri@@ p ."
The sho@@ res are from a different lo@@ cation .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tu@@ red in a st@@ one p@@ it .
"And y@@ eah , I even turned the house on top of the is@@ land red to make it look more S@@ we@@ dis@@ h ."
"So to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve a real@@ is@@ tic resul@@ t , I think it comes down to plan@@ ning ."
"It always star@@ ts with a s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch , an idea ."
Th@@ en it &apos;s about com@@ b@@ ining the different photograp@@ h@@ s .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
"And if you do a good job cap@@ tur@@ ing the phot@@ os , the resul@@ t can be quite beautiful and also quite real@@ is@@ tic ."
"So all the to@@ ols are out there , and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our ima@@ gin@@ ation ."
Thank you .

"@@ &#91; O@@ n A@@ pri@@ l 3 , 20@@ 1@@ 6 we saw the lar@@ gest data lea@@ k in history . &#93; &#91; The P@@ an@@ am@@ a P@@ ap@@ ers ex@@ pos@@ ed ri@@ ch and powerful people &#93; &#91; hi@@ ding va@@ st amoun@@ ts of money in off@@ sh@@ ore ac@@ coun@@ ts . &#93; &#91; What does this mean ? &#93; &#91; We called R@@ ob@@ er@@ t P@@ al@@ m@@ er of G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness to expla@@ in . &#93; This week , there have been a whole s@@ le@@ w and d@@ el@@ u@@ ge of stories coming out from the lea@@ k of 11 million doc@@ um@@ ents from a P@@ an@@ am@@ an@@ i@@ an@@ -@@ based la@@ w fir@@ m called M@@ os@@ s@@ ack F@@ on@@ sec@@ a ."
The re@@ lease of these p@@ ap@@ ers from P@@ an@@ am@@ a li@@ f@@ ts the ve@@ il on a tin@@ y piece of the sec@@ re@@ tive off@@ sh@@ ore world .
"We get an in@@ si@@ ght into how c@@ li@@ ents and ban@@ ks and la@@ w@@ y@@ ers go to companies like M@@ os@@ s@@ ack F@@ on@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , we want an an@@ on@@ y@@ mous company , can you give us one ? &quot; &quot; So you actually get to see the e@@ ma@@ il@@ s , you get to see the ex@@ chan@@ ges of messa@@ ges , you get to see the m@@ ech@@ an@@ ics of how this works , how this oper@@ ates ."
"Now , this has already started to have pretty im@@ medi@@ ate re@@ per@@ c@@ us@@ sions ."
The P@@ ri@@ me M@@ ini@@ ster of I@@ c@@ el@@ and has re@@ sign@@ ed .
We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the b@@ ru@@ t@@ al S@@ y@@ ri@@ an dic@@ t@@ ator B@@ as@@ ha@@ r Al@@ -@@ A@@ s@@ sa@@ d has also got off@@ sh@@ ore companies .
"There &apos;s been al@@ le@@ ga@@ tions of a $ 2 billion money tra@@ il that lea@@ ds back to P@@ re@@ si@@ dent V@@ la@@ di@@ mi@@ r P@@ u@@ ti@@ n of R@@ us@@ si@@ a vi@@ a his close chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood friend , who happens to be a top c@@ elli@@ st ."
And there will be a lot of ri@@ ch individu@@ als out there and others who will be ner@@ v@@ ous about the next set of stories and the next set of lea@@ ked doc@@ um@@ ents .
"Now , this s@@ ounds like the p@@ lot of a sp@@ y th@@ ri@@ l@@ l@@ er or a Jo@@ h@@ n G@@ ris@@ ha@@ m no@@ vel ."
"It see@@ ms very dist@@ ant from you , me , ordin@@ ary people ."
Why should we care about this ?
"But the tru@@ th is that if ri@@ ch and powerful individu@@ als are able to keep their money off@@ sh@@ ore and not pay the ta@@ x@@ es that they should , it means that there is less money for v@@ ital public serv@@ ices like heal@@ th@@ care , education , ro@@ a@@ ds ."
And that aff@@ ects all of us .
"Now , for my organ@@ ization G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this ex@@ pos@@ é has been ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al ."
We have the world &apos;s media and political lead@@ ers talking about how individu@@ als can use off@@ sh@@ ore sec@@ rec@@ y to hi@@ de and dis@@ gu@@ ise their as@@ se@@ ts — something we have been talking about and ex@@ pos@@ ing for a deca@@ de .
"Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world ba@@ ff@@ ling and conf@@ using , and hard to understand how this sort of off@@ sh@@ ore world works ."
I like to think of it a bit like a R@@ us@@ si@@ an dol@@ l .
"So you can have one company st@@ ac@@ ked inside another company , st@@ ac@@ ked inside another company , making it almost imp@@ os@@ sible to really understand who is behind these struc@@ tures ."
"It can be very difficult for la@@ w en@@ for@@ ce@@ ment or ta@@ x au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties , jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sts , ci@@ vi@@ l society to really understand what &apos;s going on ."
I also think it &apos;s interesting that there &apos;s been less co@@ verage of this issu@@ e in the United States .
"And that &apos;s perhaps because some pr@@ om@@ in@@ ent U@@ S people just ha@@ ven &apos;t fi@@ gu@@ red in this ex@@ pos@@ é , in this sc@@ and@@ al ."
"Now , that &apos;s not because there are no ri@@ ch Americ@@ ans who are sta@@ shing their as@@ se@@ ts off@@ sh@@ ore ."
"It &apos;s just because of the way in which off@@ sh@@ ore works , M@@ os@@ s@@ ack F@@ on@@ sec@@ a has fe@@ wer American c@@ li@@ ents ."
"I think if we saw lea@@ ks from the C@@ a@@ y@@ man Is@@ lan@@ ds or even from D@@ el@@ aw@@ are or W@@ y@@ om@@ ing or N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a , you would see many more ca@@ ses and exa@@ mp@@ les l@@ in@@ king back to Americ@@ ans ."
"In fact , in a number of U@@ S st@@ ates you need less information , you need to provi@@ de less information to get a company than you do to get a li@@ br@@ ary c@@ ard ."
That sort of sec@@ rec@@ y in America has allo@@ wed emp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ es of school di@@ stri@@ c@@ ts to ri@@ p off sch@@ o@@ ol@@ children .
It has allo@@ wed s@@ ca@@ mm@@ ers to ri@@ p off v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able inve@@ st@@ ors .
This is the sort of behavi@@ or that aff@@ ects all of us .
"Now , at G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in pr@@ acti@@ ce ."
How does this actually work ?
So what we did is we s@@ ent in an under@@ co@@ ver inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ator to 1@@ 3 M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an la@@ w fir@@ ms .
"O@@ ur inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ator pos@@ ed as an Afri@@ can min@@ i@@ ster who wanted to move su@@ sp@@ ect fun@@ ds into the United States to bu@@ y a house , a y@@ ach@@ t , a j@@ et ."
"Now , what was tru@@ ly sho@@ c@@ king was that all but one of those la@@ w@@ y@@ ers provi@@ ded our inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ator with su@@ g@@ ge@@ s@@ tions on how to move those su@@ sp@@ ect fun@@ ds ."
"Th@@ ese were all pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary me@@ et@@ ings , and n@@ one of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers took us on as a c@@ li@@ ent and of course no money mo@@ ved hands , but it really sho@@ ws the problem with the system ."
It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individu@@ al ca@@ ses .
This is not just about an individu@@ al la@@ w@@ y@@ er who &apos;s sp@@ o@@ ken to our under@@ co@@ ver inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ator and provi@@ ded su@@ g@@ ge@@ s@@ tions .
It &apos;s not just about a particular sen@@ i@@ or poli@@ tici@@ an who &apos;s been ca@@ ught up in a sc@@ and@@ al .
"This is about how a system works , that en@@ tr@@ en@@ ch@@ es cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion , ta@@ x ev@@ a@@ sion , po@@ ver@@ ty and inst@@ ability ."
"And in order to t@@ ack@@ le this , we need to change the ga@@ me ."
We need to change the r@@ ules of the ga@@ me to make this sort of behavi@@ or har@@ der .
"This may see@@ m like do@@ om and g@@ loo@@ m , like there &apos;s nothing we can do about it , like nothing has ever changed , like there will always be ri@@ ch and powerful individu@@ als ."
"But as a natural op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st , I do see that we are star@@ ting to get some change ."
"O@@ ver the last couple of years , we &apos;ve seen a real p@@ us@@ h to@@ wards gre@@ ater transp@@ ar@@ enc@@ y when it comes to company o@@ w@@ ner@@ ship ."
This issu@@ e was put on the political ag@@ end@@ a by the U@@ K P@@ ri@@ me M@@ ini@@ ster D@@ a@@ vi@@ d C@@ am@@ er@@ on at a big G@@ 8 S@@ um@@ m@@ it that was hel@@ d in Nor@@ ther@@ n I@@ re@@ land in 20@@ 1@@ 3 .
"And since then , the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on is going to be cre@@ ating cen@@ tr@@ al regi@@ st@@ ers at a national level of who really o@@ w@@ ns and contro@@ ls companies across Eu@@ rop@@ e ."
"One of the things that is sa@@ d is that , actually , the U@@ S is la@@ g@@ ging behind ."
"There &apos;s bi@@ par@@ tis@@ an le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation that had been int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed in the H@@ ouse and the S@@ en@@ ate , but it isn &apos;t making as much pro@@ gre@@ ss as we &apos;d like to see ."
"So we &apos;d really want to see the P@@ an@@ am@@ a lea@@ ks , this huge pe@@ e@@ k into the off@@ sh@@ ore world , be used as a way of op@@ ening up in the U@@ S and around the world ."
"For us at G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this is a moment for change ."
We need ordin@@ ary people to get an@@ gr@@ y at the way in which people can hi@@ de their identi@@ ty behind sec@@ re@@ t companies .
"We need business lead@@ ers to st@@ and up and say , &quot; S@@ ec@@ rec@@ y like this is not good for business . &quot;"
"We need political lead@@ ers to recogn@@ ize the problem , and to comm@@ it to chan@@ ging the la@@ w to open up this sort of sec@@ rec@@ y ."
"T@@ o@@ gether , we can end the sec@@ rec@@ y that is curr@@ ently allo@@ wing ta@@ x ev@@ a@@ sion , cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion , money la@@ under@@ ing to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh ."
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : J@@ u@@ li@@ an , w@@ el@@ come ."
"It &apos;s been re@@ por@@ ted that W@@ i@@ ki@@ L@@ ea@@ ks , your bab@@ y , has , in the last few years has re@@ le@@ ased more cla@@ ssi@@ fied doc@@ um@@ ents than the rest of the world &apos;s media com@@ b@@ ined ."
C@@ an that pos@@ si@@ bly be true ?
"@@ J@@ u@@ li@@ an A@@ ss@@ an@@ ge : Y@@ eah , can it pos@@ si@@ bly be true ?"
It &apos;s a wor@@ ry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of acti@@ vi@@ sts is able to re@@ lease more of that typ@@ e of information than the rest of the world pre@@ ss com@@ b@@ ined .
C@@ A : How does it work ?
How do people re@@ lease the doc@@ um@@ ents ?
And how do you sec@@ ure their pri@@ v@@ acy ?
"@@ J@@ A : So these are — as far as we can tell — cla@@ ssi@@ cal whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ w@@ ers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us ."
"So we use this st@@ ate@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art enc@@ r@@ yp@@ tion to b@@ oun@@ ce stuff around the Internet , to hi@@ de tra@@ il@@ s , pas@@ s it through le@@ g@@ al ju@@ ris@@ dic@@ tions like S@@ we@@ den and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those le@@ g@@ al prot@@ ec@@ tions ."
"We get information in the ma@@ il , the re@@ gu@@ lar pos@@ t@@ al ma@@ il , enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted or not , v@@ et it like a re@@ gu@@ lar news organ@@ ization , form@@ at it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about gi@@ ant dat@@ ab@@ ases of information — re@@ lease it to the public and then de@@ f@@ end ourselves against the in@@ ev@@ it@@ able le@@ g@@ al and political att@@ ac@@ ks ."
"C@@ A : So you make an eff@@ ort to en@@ sure the doc@@ um@@ ents are le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate , but you actually almost never know who the identi@@ ty of the source is ?"
"@@ J@@ A : That &apos;s right , y@@ eah . V@@ ery r@@ are@@ ly do we ever know , and if we find out at some st@@ age then we de@@ st@@ ro@@ y that information as so@@ on as possible ."
( P@@ h@@ one r@@ ing ) G@@ od d@@ am@@ n it .
( Laughter ) C@@ A : I think that &apos;s the C@@ I@@ A as@@ king what the co@@ de is for a TED mem@@ ber@@ ship . ( Laughter )
"So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually ."
This is something you lea@@ ked a few years ago .
If we can have this do@@ cu@@ ment up ...
So this was a story in K@@ en@@ y@@ a a few years ago .
C@@ an you tell us what you lea@@ ked and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ ro@@ ll R@@ ep@@ ort .
This was a sec@@ re@@ t int@@ elli@@ g@@ ence re@@ p@@ ort com@@ mi@@ ssi@@ on@@ ed by the K@@ en@@ y@@ an government after its elec@@ tion in 200@@ 4 .
"P@@ ri@@ or to 200@@ 4 , K@@ en@@ y@@ a was r@@ ul@@ ed by D@@ an@@ i@@ el ar@@ a@@ p M@@ o@@ i for about 1@@ 8 years ."
He was a so@@ ft dic@@ t@@ ator of K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
"And when K@@ i@@ ba@@ k@@ i got into power — through a co@@ ali@@ tion of for@@ ces that were trying to cle@@ an up cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion in K@@ en@@ y@@ a — they com@@ mi@@ ssi@@ on@@ ed this re@@ p@@ ort , spent about two million p@@ ounds on this and an as@@ soci@@ ated re@@ p@@ ort ."
"And then the government s@@ at on it and used it for political le@@ verage on M@@ o@@ i , who was the ri@@ ch@@ est man — still is the ri@@ ch@@ est man — in K@@ en@@ y@@ a ."
It &apos;s the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il of K@@ en@@ y@@ an jour@@ n@@ al@@ ism .
"So I went there in 200@@ 7 , and we man@@ ag@@ ed to get h@@ old of this just pri@@ or to the elec@@ tion — the national elec@@ tion , D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 8 ."
"When we re@@ le@@ ased that re@@ p@@ ort , we did so three days after the new pre@@ si@@ dent , K@@ i@@ ba@@ k@@ i , had decided to p@@ al up with the man that he was going to cle@@ an out , D@@ an@@ i@@ el ar@@ a@@ p M@@ o@@ i , so this re@@ p@@ ort then became a de@@ ad al@@ b@@ at@@ ross around P@@ re@@ si@@ dent K@@ i@@ ba@@ k@@ i &apos;s nec@@ k ."
"C@@ A : And — I mean , to c@@ ut a long story sh@@ ort — word of the re@@ p@@ ort lea@@ ked into K@@ en@@ y@@ a , not from the off@@ ici@@ al media , but in@@ direc@@ tly , and in your op@@ ini@@ on , it actually shi@@ f@@ ted the elec@@ tion ."
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ eah . So this became front p@@ age of the G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an and was then prin@@ ted in all the sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding countries of K@@ en@@ y@@ a , in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ an and S@@ outh Afri@@ can pre@@ ss ."
And so it came in from the outside .
"And that , after a couple of days , made the K@@ en@@ y@@ an pre@@ ss feel sa@@ fe to talk about it ."
"And it r@@ an for 20 ni@@ ghts stra@@ ight on K@@ en@@ y@@ an T@@ V , shi@@ f@@ ted the v@@ ote by 10 percent , ac@@ cor@@ ding to a K@@ en@@ y@@ an int@@ elli@@ g@@ ence re@@ p@@ ort , which changed the resul@@ t of the elec@@ tion ."
"C@@ A : W@@ ow , so your lea@@ k really sub@@ st@@ anti@@ ally changed the world ?"
J@@ A : Y@@ ep .
( Applause ) C@@ A : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a sh@@ ort c@@ li@@ p from this B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad a@@ ir@@ stri@@ ke video .
"The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a sh@@ ort c@@ li@@ p ."
"This is — this is in@@ ten@@ se materi@@ al , I should war@@ n you ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ di@@ o : ... just f@@ uc@@ k@@ in &apos; , once you get on &apos; e@@ m just open &apos; e@@ m up ."
"I see your ele@@ ment , u@@ h , got about four H@@ um@@ ve@@ es , u@@ h , out along ..@@ ."
You &apos;re cle@@ ar . All right . F@@ ir@@ ing .
Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s sh@@ oo@@ t .
L@@ ight &apos; e@@ m all up .
"@@ C &apos;@@ m@@ on , fir@@ e !@@ "
( M@@ ach@@ ine gu@@ n fir@@ e ) K@@ e@@ ep sh@@ oo@@ t &apos; n . K@@ e@@ ep sh@@ oo@@ t &apos; n . ( M@@ ach@@ ine gu@@ n fir@@ e ) K@@ e@@ ep sh@@ oo@@ t &apos; n .
"H@@ ot@@ el ... B@@ u@@ sh@@ ma@@ ster T@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ S@@ i@@ x , B@@ u@@ sh@@ ma@@ ster T@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ S@@ i@@ x ,@@ "
"@@ we need to move , time now !@@ "
"A@@ ll right , we just eng@@ ag@@ ed all e@@ ight individu@@ als ."
"@@ Y@@ eah , we see two bir@@ ds &#91; he@@ li@@ cop@@ ters &#93; , and we &apos;re still fir@@ ing ."
R@@ o@@ ger . I got &apos; e@@ m .
"T@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ S@@ i@@ x , this is T@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ S@@ i@@ x , we &apos;re mo@@ bi@@ le ."
"O@@ op@@ s , I &apos;m sor@@ ry . What was going on ?"
"@@ G@@ od d@@ am@@ n it , K@@ y@@ le . All right , ha@@ ha@@ h@@ a . I h@@ it &apos; e@@ m ."
"C@@ A : So , what was the imp@@ act of that ?"
J@@ A : The imp@@ act on the people who worked on it was se@@ v@@ ere .
We en@@ ded up sen@@ ding two people to B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad to f@@ ur@@ ther research that story .
So this is just the first of three att@@ ac@@ ks that oc@@ cur@@ red in that sc@@ en@@ e .
"C@@ A : So , I mean , 11 people died in that att@@ ack , right , inclu@@ ding two Re@@ u@@ ters emp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ es ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ eah . T@@ w@@ o Re@@ u@@ ters emp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ es , two young children were w@@ oun@@ ded ."
There were between 1@@ 8 and 2@@ 6 people kill@@ ed all together .
C@@ A : And re@@ le@@ as@@ ing this ca@@ used wi@@ de@@ sp@@ read ou@@ tra@@ ge .
"What was the key ele@@ ment of this that actually ca@@ used the ou@@ tra@@ ge , do you think ?"
J@@ A : I don &apos;t know . I gu@@ ess people can see the gr@@ os@@ s di@@ sp@@ ar@@ ity in for@@ ce .
"You have guys wal@@ king in a rela@@ x@@ ed way down the stre@@ et , and then an A@@ p@@ ac@@ he he@@ li@@ cop@@ ter sit@@ ting up at one k@@ il@@ ome@@ ter fir@@ ing 3@@ 0@@ -@@ m@@ illi@@ me@@ ter can@@ n@@ on sh@@ ells on everyone — looking for any exc@@ use to do so — and kill@@ ing people re@@ sc@@ u@@ ing the w@@ oun@@ ded ."
And there was two jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sts inv@@ olved that c@@ lear@@ ly wer@@ en &apos;t in@@ sur@@ g@@ ents because that &apos;s their ful@@ l@@ -@@ time job .
"C@@ A : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.@@ S@@ . int@@ elli@@ g@@ ence anal@@ y@@ st , B@@ ra@@ d@@ le@@ y M@@ an@@ ning , ar@@ re@@ sted , and it &apos;s al@@ le@@ ged that he conf@@ ess@@ ed in a ch@@ at room to have lea@@ ked this video to you , along with 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 cla@@ ssi@@ fied U.@@ S@@ . em@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y ca@@ bl@@ es ."
"I mean , did he ?"
J@@ A : We have den@@ i@@ ed re@@ cei@@ ving those ca@@ bl@@ es .
"He has been char@@ ged , about five days ago , with ob@@ ta@@ ining 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 ca@@ bl@@ es and re@@ le@@ as@@ ing 50 ."
"Now , we had re@@ le@@ ased , early in the year , a ca@@ ble from the R@@ ey@@ k@@ j@@ a@@ vi@@ k U.@@ S@@ . em@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y , but this is not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly connec@@ ted ."
"I mean , I was a known vi@@ sit@@ or of that em@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y ."
"C@@ A : I mean , if you did re@@ cei@@ ve thousands of U.@@ S@@ . em@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y di@@ pl@@ om@@ ati@@ c ca@@ bl@@ es ..@@ ."
"@@ J@@ A : We would have re@@ le@@ ased them . ( C@@ A : You would ? ) J@@ A : Y@@ eah . ( C@@ A : Because ? ) J@@ A : Well , because these sort of things re@@ ve@@ al what the true state of , say , A@@ ra@@ b govern@@ ments are like , the true human@@ -@@ ri@@ ghts ab@@ uses in those govern@@ ments ."
"If you look at dec@@ la@@ ssi@@ fied ca@@ bl@@ es , that &apos;s the sort of materi@@ al that &apos;s there ."
C@@ A : So let &apos;s talk a little more bro@@ ad@@ ly about this .
"I mean , in gener@@ al , what &apos;s your ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y ?"
Why is it right to enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge lea@@ king of sec@@ re@@ t information ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve re@@ form ."
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
"So information that organ@@ iz@@ ations are sp@@ ending econom@@ ic eff@@ ort into con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing , that &apos;s a really good sign@@ al that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organ@@ iz@@ ations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are sp@@ ending work to con@@ ce@@ al it ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in pr@@ acti@@ ce , and that &apos;s what the history of jour@@ n@@ al@@ ism is ."
"C@@ A : But are there ris@@ ks with that , either to the individu@@ als con@@ cer@@ ned or in@@ de@@ ed to society at large , where lea@@ king can actually have an un@@ in@@ ten@@ ded con@@ sequ@@ ence ?"
J@@ A : N@@ ot that we have seen with anything we have re@@ le@@ ased .
"I mean , we have a har@@ m im@@ m@@ un@@ ization poli@@ cy ."
We have a way of de@@ al@@ ing with information that has sort of pers@@ onal — pers@@ on@@ ally identi@@ f@@ ying information in it .
"But there are le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate sec@@ re@@ ts — you know , your rec@@ or@@ ds with your doc@@ tor ; that &apos;s a le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate sec@@ re@@ t — but we de@@ al with whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ w@@ ers that are coming for@@ ward that are really sort of w@@ ell@@ -@@ m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated ."
C@@ A : So they are w@@ ell@@ -@@ m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated .
"And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the par@@ ent of someone wh@@ ose son is out ser@@ ving the U.@@ S@@ . mil@@ it@@ ary , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an inc@@ enti@@ ve to put out ."
It sho@@ ws a U.@@ S@@ . sol@@ di@@ er la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing at people d@@ ying .
"That gi@@ ves the imp@@ re@@ s@@ sion , has given the imp@@ re@@ s@@ sion , to m@@ illions of people around the world that U.@@ S@@ . sol@@ di@@ ers are in@@ human people ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How d@@ are you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ eah , we do get a lot of that ."
"But remember , the people in B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad , the people in I@@ ra@@ q , the people in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day ."
So it &apos;s not going to change their op@@ ini@@ on . It &apos;s not going to change their per@@ cep@@ tion .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
"It will change the per@@ cep@@ tion and op@@ ini@@ on of the people who are pa@@ ying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope ."
C@@ A : So you found a way to sh@@ ine light into what you see as these sort of d@@ ark sec@@ re@@ ts in companies and in government .
L@@ ight is good .
"But do you see any ir@@ on@@ y in the fact that , in order for you to sh@@ ine that light , you have to , yourself , create sec@@ rec@@ y around your sources ?"
"@@ J@@ A : N@@ ot really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any W@@ i@@ ki@@ L@@ ea@@ ks dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents yet ."
We don &apos;t have sources who are dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents on other sources .
"S@@ h@@ ould they come for@@ ward , that would be a tri@@ ck@@ y situ@@ ation for us , but we &apos;re pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly ac@@ ting in such a way that people feel mor@@ ally comp@@ ell@@ ed to contin@@ ue our mis@@ sion , not to scre@@ w it up ."
"C@@ A : I &apos;d actually be interest@@ ed , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous as to the op@@ ini@@ on in the TED au@@ di@@ ence ."
"You know , there might be a couple of vi@@ e@@ ws of W@@ i@@ ki@@ L@@ ea@@ ks and of J@@ u@@ li@@ an ."
"You know , her@@ o — people &apos;s her@@ o — br@@ ing@@ ing this important light ."
D@@ ang@@ er@@ ous tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker .
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the her@@ o view ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker view ?
"@@ J@@ A : O@@ h , come on . There must be some ."
"C@@ A : It &apos;s a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d , J@@ u@@ li@@ an , a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
"Now here &apos;s something that you ha@@ ven &apos;t yet lea@@ ked , but I think for TED you are ."
"I mean it &apos;s an in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?"
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a sa@@ mple of what we do sort of every day .
"So l@@ ate last year — in N@@ o@@ ve@@ m@@ ber last year — there was a ser@@ ies of well blo@@ w@@ ou@@ ts in Al@@ ban@@ ia , like the well blo@@ w@@ out in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , but not quite as big ."
"And we got a re@@ p@@ ort — a sort of engine@@ ering anal@@ y@@ s@@ is into what happened — saying that , in fact , sec@@ ur@@ ity gu@@ ar@@ ds from some ri@@ v@@ al , vari@@ ous com@@ pe@@ ting o@@ il fir@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked tr@@ uc@@ ks there and blo@@ wn them up ."
"And part of the Al@@ ban@@ i@@ an government was in this , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
"And the engine@@ ering re@@ p@@ ort had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extre@@ me@@ ly difficult do@@ cu@@ ment for us ."
We couldn &apos;t ver@@ i@@ f@@ y it because we didn &apos;t know who wr@@ ote it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical that maybe it was a com@@ pe@@ ting o@@ il fir@@ m just sort of pla@@ ying the issu@@ e up .
"So under that b@@ as@@ is , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , we &apos;re s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical about this thing ."
"We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?"
"The materi@@ al looks good , it fe@@ els right , but we just can &apos;t ver@@ i@@ f@@ y it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a le@@ tter just this week from the company who wr@@ ote it , wan@@ ting to tr@@ ack down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , we want to tr@@ ack down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , tell us more ."
"What do@@ cu@@ ment is it , pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly , you &apos;re talking about ?"
C@@ an you show that you had le@@ g@@ al au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over that do@@ cu@@ ment ?
I@@ s it really y@@ ours ? &quot; &quot; So they s@@ ent us this scre@@ en sho@@ t with the au@@ th@@ or in the M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t W@@ ord I@@ D .
Y@@ eah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
"This is like one of our me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of identi@@ f@@ ying , of ver@@ i@@ f@@ ying , what a materi@@ al is , is to try and get these guys to wr@@ ite le@@ t@@ ters ."
C@@ A : Y@@ eah . H@@ a@@ ve you had information from inside B@@ P ?
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ eah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are under@@ going a sort of ser@@ i@@ ous fund@@ ra@@ is@@ ing and engine@@ ering eff@@ ort ."
So our publi@@ cation r@@ ate over the past few months has been sort of min@@ i@@ mi@@ z@@ ed while we &apos;re re@@ -@@ engine@@ ering our back systems for the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al public inter@@ est that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
"I mean , like any sort of gro@@ wing star@@ tu@@ p organ@@ ization , we are sort of over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by our gro@@ w@@ th , and that means we &apos;re getting en@@ or@@ mous qu@@ anti@@ ty of whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer di@@ sc@@ l@@ os@@ u@@ res of a very high c@@ ali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and v@@ et this information ."
"C@@ A : So that &apos;s the key bot@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ k , basically jour@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and / or the fund@@ ing of jour@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ ep . Y@@ eah , and tru@@ sted people ."
"I mean , we &apos;re an organ@@ ization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of materi@@ al we de@@ al with , so we have to re@@ structure in order to have people who will de@@ al with the high@@ est national sec@@ ur@@ ity stuff , and then lo@@ wer sec@@ ur@@ ity ca@@ ses ."
C@@ A : So help us understand a bit about you pers@@ on@@ ally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a k@@ id you went to 3@@ 7 different sch@@ o@@ ols .
C@@ an that be right ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , my parents were in the mo@@ vi@@ e business and then on the run from a cul@@ t , so the com@@ b@@ in@@ ation between the two ..@@ ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A : I mean , a p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ st might say that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for b@@ ree@@ ding par@@ an@@ o@@ ia ."
"@@ J@@ A : What , the mo@@ vi@@ e business ?"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) C@@ A : And you were also — I mean , you were also a h@@ ack@@ er at an early age and r@@ an into the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties early on ."
"@@ J@@ A : Well , I was a jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st ."
"You know , I was a very young jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st acti@@ vi@@ st at an early age ."
"I wr@@ ote a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine , was pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted for it when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er ."
So you have to be care@@ ful with h@@ ack@@ er .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a me@@ th@@ od that can be dep@@ lo@@ yed for vari@@ ous things .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , at the moment , it &apos;s m@@ os@@ tly dep@@ lo@@ yed by the R@@ us@@ si@@ an ma@@ fi@@ a in order to ste@@ al your gr@@ and@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts ."
"So this ph@@ ra@@ se is not , not as n@@ ice as it used to be ."
"C@@ A : Y@@ eah , well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ al@@ ing any@@ one &apos;s gr@@ and@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t , but what about your c@@ ore val@@ ues ?"
C@@ an you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some in@@ ci@@ dent in your life that help@@ ed de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure about the in@@ ci@@ dent .
"But the c@@ ore val@@ ues : well , cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ."
"And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men that have been in my life ."
"C@@ A : C@@ ap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ eah . And you know , I &apos;m a com@@ b@@ ative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the n@@ ur@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , which is to poli@@ ce per@@ pe@@ tr@@ at@@ ors of cri@@ me ."
And so that is something that has been in my char@@ ac@@ ter for a long time .
"C@@ A : So just tell us , very quickly in the last min@@ u@@ te , the story : what happened in I@@ c@@ el@@ and ?"
"You basically publi@@ shed something there , r@@ an into tr@@ ou@@ ble with a b@@ ank , then the news serv@@ ice there was in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ ted from run@@ ning the story ."
"I@@ n@@ st@@ ead , they publi@@ ci@@ z@@ ed your side ."
That made you very high@@ -@@ pro@@ fi@@ le in I@@ c@@ el@@ and . What happened next ?
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ eah , this is a great case , you know ."
I@@ c@@ el@@ and went through this fin@@ anci@@ al c@@ ris@@ is .
It was the har@@ de@@ st h@@ it of any country in the world .
I@@ ts ban@@ king sec@@ tor was 10 times the G@@ D@@ P of the rest of the econom@@ y .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , so we re@@ lease this re@@ p@@ ort in J@@ u@@ ly last year ."
"And the national T@@ V st@@ ation was in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ ted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a mo@@ vi@@ e : in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion lan@@ ded on the news de@@ s@@ k , and the news read@@ er was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;"
"Well , we just show the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite instead , for all that time , as a f@@ ill@@ er , and we became very fa@@ mous in I@@ c@@ el@@ and , went to I@@ c@@ el@@ and and sp@@ o@@ ke about this issu@@ e ."
"And there was a feel@@ ing in the community that that should never happen again , and as a resul@@ t , working with I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c poli@@ tici@@ ans and some other inter@@ national le@@ g@@ al exper@@ ts , we put together a new sort of p@@ ack@@ age of le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation for I@@ c@@ el@@ and to sort of become an off@@ sh@@ ore ha@@ ven for the free pre@@ ss , with the str@@ on@@ gest jour@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic prot@@ ec@@ tions in the world , with a new N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for f@@ ree@@ dom of spe@@ ec@@ h ."
"I@@ c@@ el@@ and &apos;s a Nor@@ di@@ c country , so , like Nor@@ way , it &apos;s able to ta@@ p into the system ."
"And just a mon@@ th ago , this was pas@@ sed by the I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ a@@ ment un@@ anim@@ ously ."
C@@ A : W@@ ow .
"( Applause ) L@@ ast question , J@@ u@@ li@@ an ."
"When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more like@@ ly to be B@@ i@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther ex@@ er@@ ting more control , more sec@@ rec@@ y , or us wat@@ ching B@@ i@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther , or it &apos;s just all to be pla@@ yed for either way ?"
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
"I mean , there &apos;s en@@ or@@ mous pres@@ su@@ res to har@@ mon@@ ize f@@ ree@@ dom of spe@@ ec@@ h le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation and transp@@ ar@@ enc@@ y le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation around the world — within the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , between China and the United States ."
Wh@@ ich way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
"That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of eff@@ ort , we can shi@@ ft it one way or the other ."
"C@@ A : Well , it looks like I &apos;m re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ting the au@@ di@@ ence &apos;s op@@ ini@@ on to say , J@@ u@@ li@@ an , be care@@ ful , and all power to you ."
"@@ J@@ A : Thank you , Ch@@ r@@ is . ( C@@ A : Thank you . ) ( Applause )@@ "
"As a matter of fact , I was trying to think about my care@@ er since I left the Wh@@ ite H@@ ouse , and the best example I have is a car@@ to@@ on in The New Yor@@ ker a couple of years ago ."
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , when I grow up , I want to be a form@@ er pre@@ si@@ dent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great b@@ le@@ ssing as a form@@ er pre@@ si@@ dent , because I have had an ac@@ cess that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"N@@ ot only am I fami@@ li@@ ar with the 50 st@@ ates in the United States , but also my wi@@ fe and I have vi@@ s@@ ited more than 1@@ 4@@ 5 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter has had ful@@ l@@ -@@ time progra@@ ms in 80 n@@ ations on Earth ."
"And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the me@@ et the king or the pre@@ si@@ dent , but we also me@@ et the v@@ il@@ la@@ g@@ ers who live in the most re@@ m@@ ote are@@ as of Africa ."
"So our over@@ all comm@@ it@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is to pr@@ om@@ ote human ri@@ ghts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equ@@ i@@ vo@@ cation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ ghts on Earth is , str@@ an@@ ge@@ ly , not ad@@ dre@@ ssed quite often , is the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to beg@@ in with .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all is the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation of reli@@ gi@@ ous scri@@ p@@ tures , ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ tures , in the B@@ i@@ ble , O@@ ld T@@ est@@ a@@ ment , New T@@ est@@ a@@ ment , Q@@ ur@@ an and so for@@ th , and these have been mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ c@@ end@@ ant pos@@ i@@ tions in the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gu@@ es and the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es and in the m@@ os@@ qu@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these r@@ ules to make sure that women are ordin@@ ari@@ ly re@@ le@@ g@@ ated to a secon@@ d@@ ary pos@@ ition com@@ par@@ ed to men in the eyes of G@@ od .
This is a very ser@@ i@@ ous problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ ari@@ ly not ad@@ dre@@ ssed .
"A number of years ago , in the year 2@@ 000 , I had been a B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st , a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st for 70 years — I tell you , I still te@@ ach S@@ un@@ day school every S@@ un@@ day ; I &apos;ll be teach@@ ing this S@@ un@@ day as well — but the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st Con@@ ven@@ tion in the year 2@@ 000 decided that women should play a secon@@ d@@ ary pos@@ ition , a sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent pos@@ ition to men ."
"So they issu@@ ed an e@@ dic@@ t , in eff@@ ect , that pre@@ v@@ ents women from being pri@@ est@@ s , pa@@ st@@ ors , de@@ ac@@ ons in the ch@@ ur@@ ch , or ch@@ ap@@ la@@ ins in the mil@@ it@@ ary , and if a woman teach@@ es a cla@@ ss@@ room in a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st se@@ min@@ ary , they cannot te@@ ach if a bo@@ y is in the room , because you can find ver@@ ses in the B@@ i@@ ble , there &apos;s over 3@@ 0,000 ver@@ ses in the B@@ i@@ ble , that say that a woman sh@@ ouldn &apos;t te@@ ach a man , and so for@@ th ."
But the ba@@ si@@ c thing is the scri@@ p@@ tures are mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ c@@ end@@ ant pos@@ ition .
"That is an all@@ -@@ per@@ va@@ sive problem , because men can ex@@ er@@ t that power and if an ab@@ usi@@ ve h@@ us@@ b@@ and or an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er , for inst@@ ance , wan@@ ts to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equ@@ al in the eyes of G@@ od , why should I tre@@ at them as equ@@ als myself ?"
Why should I pay them equ@@ al pay for doing the same kind of work ?
"The other very ser@@ i@@ ous bli@@ ght that ca@@ uses this problem is the exc@@ es@@ sive re@@ sort to viol@@ ence , and that is incre@@ as@@ ing tre@@ m@@ end@@ ously around the world ."
"In the United States of America , for inst@@ ance , we have had an en@@ or@@ mous incre@@ ase in ab@@ use of poor people , m@@ os@@ tly black people and min@@ ori@@ ties , by pu@@ tting them in pri@@ son ."
"When I was in off@@ ice as govern@@ or of G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans were in pri@@ son ."
"N@@ o@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pri@@ son ."
That &apos;s a se@@ ven@@ fo@@ ld incre@@ ase .
"And since I left the Wh@@ ite H@@ ouse , there &apos;s been an 8@@ 00 percent incre@@ ase in the number of women who are black who are in pri@@ son ."
We also have &#91; one of the only countries &#93; on Earth that still has the de@@ ath p@@ en@@ al@@ ty that is a develop@@ ed country .
And we r@@ ank right al@@ on@@ g@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ usi@@ ve in all el@@ em@@ ents of human ri@@ ghts in enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ging the de@@ ath p@@ en@@ al@@ ty .
"We &apos;re in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a now , and I fi@@ gu@@ red out the other day that C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a has spent four billion dollars in conv@@ ic@@ ting 1@@ 3 people for the de@@ ath p@@ en@@ al@@ ty ."
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it cos@@ ts C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a to s@@ end a person to be ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted ."
"N@@ e@@ bra@@ sk@@ a this week just pas@@ sed a la@@ w ab@@ o@@ li@@ shing the de@@ ath p@@ en@@ al@@ ty , because it cos@@ ts so much . ( Applause ) So the re@@ sort to viol@@ ence and ab@@ use of poor people and help@@ less people is another cause of the incre@@ ase in ab@@ use of women ."
"@@ Let me just go down a very few ab@@ uses of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fa@@ ir@@ ly bri@@ e@@ f , because I have a lim@@ ited amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ lation .
"@@ G@@ en@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ lation is hor@@ ri@@ ble and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a gir@@ l , very so@@ on in her life , her gen@@ it@@ als are completely c@@ ut away by a so@@ -@@ called cu@@ tter who has a ra@@ z@@ or b@@ la@@ de and , in a non@@ -@@ st@@ eri@@ li@@ z@@ ed way , they re@@ move the ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or parts of a woman &apos;s gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a ."
"And sometimes , in more extre@@ me ca@@ ses but not very r@@ are ca@@ ses , they se@@ w the ori@@ f@@ ice up so the gir@@ l can just ur@@ in@@ ate or men@@ str@@ u@@ ate ."
"And then later , when she gets mar@@ ri@@ ed , the same cu@@ tter goes in and op@@ ens the ori@@ f@@ ice up so she can have se@@ x ."
"This is not a r@@ are thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , for inst@@ ance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the fe@@ mal@@ es that live in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t today have been se@@ x@@ u@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated in that way ."
"In some countries , it &apos;s more than 9@@ 8 percent of the women are c@@ ut that way before they re@@ ach mat@@ ur@@ ity ."
This is a hor@@ ri@@ ble aff@@ lic@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
"A@@ no@@ ther very ser@@ i@@ ous thing is hon@@ or kill@@ ings , where a family with mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation , again , of a ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ ture — there &apos;s nothing in the Q@@ ur@@ an that m@@ and@@ ates this — will ex@@ ec@@ u@@ te a gir@@ l in their family if she is r@@ ap@@ ed or if she mar@@ ri@@ es a man that her father does not appro@@ ve , or sometimes even if she w@@ ear@@ s in@@ appro@@ pri@@ ate c@@ lo@@ thing ."
"And this is done by mem@@ bers of her own family , so the family be@@ comes m@@ ur@@ der@@ ers when the gir@@ l br@@ ings so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gr@@ ace to the family ."
"A@@ n anal@@ y@@ s@@ is was done in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t not so long ago by the United N@@ ations and it sho@@ wed that 7@@ 5 percent of these m@@ ur@@ ders of a gir@@ l are per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ated by the father , the un@@ cle or the bro@@ ther , but 25 percent of the m@@ ur@@ ders are con@@ duc@@ ted by women ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that re@@ l@@ ates to women partic@@ ul@@ arly is s@@ la@@ very , or human tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people so@@ ld from Africa into s@@ la@@ very in the New Wor@@ ld back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now living in s@@ la@@ very .
"The United States D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment of St@@ ate now has a m@@ and@@ ate from Con@@ gre@@ ss to give a re@@ p@@ ort every year , and the St@@ ate D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment re@@ por@@ ts that 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people are so@@ ld across inter@@ national bor@@ ders every year into s@@ la@@ very , and that 80 percent of those so@@ ld are women , into se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are living in human b@@ on@@ d@@ age , or s@@ la@@ very ."
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is lo@@ cated and where I te@@ ach at E@@ m@@ ory U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sity , they have between 200 and 3@@ 00 women , people so@@ ld into s@@ la@@ very every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the n@@ ation because of that .
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a has the bu@@ si@@ est a@@ ir@@ p@@ ort in the world , and they also have a lot of pas@@ sen@@ g@@ ers that come from the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n H@@ e@@ mi@@ sp@@ here ."
"If a bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ ner wan@@ ts to bu@@ y a gir@@ l that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ it@@ e-@@ sk@@ in@@ ned gir@@ l br@@ ings se@@ ver@@ al times more than that , and the a@@ verage bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ ner in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per s@@ la@@ ve ."
"The se@@ x tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds the t@@ ot@@ al dru@@ g tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a ."
"So this is another very ser@@ i@@ ous problem , and the ba@@ si@@ c problem is pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion , because there &apos;s not a wh@@ o@@ re@@ house in America that &apos;s not known by the lo@@ cal off@@ ici@@ als , the lo@@ cal poli@@ ce@@ men , or the ch@@ i@@ e@@ f of poli@@ ce or the ma@@ y@@ or and so for@@ th ."
"And this lea@@ ds to one of the wor@@ st problems , and that is that women are b@@ ou@@ ght incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly and put into se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very in all countries in the world ."
S@@ we@@ den has got a good appro@@ ach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , S@@ we@@ den decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted if they are in se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very , but the bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ n@@ ers and the p@@ imp@@ s and the m@@ ale cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , and — ( Applause ) — pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion has g@@ one down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite pos@@ ition ."
"For every m@@ ale ar@@ re@@ sted for il@@ le@@ g@@ al se@@ x tra@@ de , 25 women are ar@@ re@@ sted in the United States of America ."
"C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , I@@ re@@ land , I &apos;ve already said S@@ we@@ den , F@@ r@@ ance , and other countries are moving now to@@ wards this so@@ -@@ called S@@ we@@ dis@@ h model ."
That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
We have two great in@@ stitu@@ tions in this country that all of us ad@@ m@@ ire : our mil@@ it@@ ary and our great univer@@ sity system .
"In the mil@@ it@@ ary , they are now anal@@ y@@ zing how many se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts take place ."
"The last re@@ p@@ ort I got , there were 2@@ 6@@ ,000 se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts that took place in the mil@@ it@@ ary — 2@@ 6@@ ,000 ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , and the reason is that the comm@@ anding off@@ ic@@ er of any organ@@ ization — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a b@@ at@@ tal@@ i@@ on in the Ar@@ my or a company in the Mar@@ ines — the comm@@ anding off@@ ic@@ er has the right under la@@ w to deci@@ de whether to pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ te a r@@ ap@@ ist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their comm@@ and , se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts are taking place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w needs to be changed .
"A@@ b@@ out one out of four gir@@ ls who en@@ ter American univer@@ si@@ ties will be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted before she gra@@ du@@ ates , and this is now getting a lot of publi@@ city , par@@ ti@@ ally because of my book , but other things , and so 8@@ 9 univer@@ si@@ ties in America are now con@@ de@@ m@@ ned by the D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment of E@@ du@@ cation under T@@ it@@ le I@@ X because the off@@ ici@@ als of the univer@@ si@@ ties are not taking care of the women to prot@@ ect them from se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ ult ."
"The D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment of J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce says that more than half of the r@@ ap@@ es on a colle@@ ge ca@@ mp@@ us take place by ser@@ i@@ al r@@ ap@@ i@@ sts , because outside of the univer@@ sity system , if they r@@ ape somebody , they &apos;ll be pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , but when they get on a univer@@ sity ca@@ mp@@ us , they can r@@ ape with imp@@ unity ."
They &apos;re not pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very ser@@ i@@ ous about the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls is the l@@ ack of equ@@ al pay for equ@@ al work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is sometimes mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted , but for ful@@ l@@ -@@ time emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I became pre@@ si@@ dent , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
"So we &apos;ve made some pro@@ gre@@ ss , par@@ ti@@ ally because I was pre@@ si@@ dent and so for@@ th — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no pro@@ gre@@ ss made , so it &apos;s been just about 2@@ 3 or 2@@ 4 percent difference for the last 15 years ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ ort@@ un@@ e 5@@ 00 companies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 5@@ 00 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an a@@ verage than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like n@@ ation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d Wor@@ ld W@@ ar .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground fi@@ gh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been fl@@ ying over@@ head dro@@ pp@@ ing b@@ om@@ b@@ s on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have dr@@ ones that att@@ ack people and so for@@ th ."
We &apos;ve been at war with 25 different countries or more since the S@@ econ@@ d Wor@@ ld W@@ ar .
"There was four years , I won &apos;t say which ones , where we didn &apos;t — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t dro@@ p a b@@ om@@ b , we didn &apos;t la@@ unch a mi@@ ssi@@ le , we didn &apos;t fir@@ e a b@@ ul@@ let ."
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the re@@ sort to viol@@ ence and the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation of the ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ tures are what ca@@ uses , are the ba@@ si@@ c ca@@ uses , of ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls ."
"There &apos;s one more ba@@ si@@ c cause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a d@@ am@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The a@@ verage man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls qu@@ i@@ e@@ tly ac@@ cep@@ ts the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged pos@@ ition that we oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y , and this is very si@@ mil@@ ar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ par@@ ate but equ@@ al had ex@@ ist@@ ed ."
"@@ R@@ ac@@ i@@ al di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation , le@@ g@@ ally , had ex@@ ist@@ ed for 100 years , from 18@@ 6@@ 5 at the end of the W@@ ar Be@@ tween the States , the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar , all the way up to the 19@@ 6@@ 0s , when L@@ y@@ n@@ don Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son got the b@@ ill@@ s pas@@ sed for equ@@ al ri@@ ghts ."
"But during that time , there were many wh@@ ite people that didn &apos;t think that r@@ ac@@ i@@ al di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation was o@@ kay , but they sta@@ yed qu@@ i@@ et , because they en@@ jo@@ yed the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ges of better j@@ ob@@ s , uni@@ que ac@@ cess to j@@ ury du@@ ty , better sch@@ o@@ ols , and everything else , and that &apos;s the same thing that ex@@ i@@ sts today , because the a@@ verage man really doesn &apos;t care ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation against gir@@ ls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ jo@@ y a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged pos@@ ition ."
"And it &apos;s very difficult to get the maj@@ or@@ ity of men who control the univer@@ sity system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the mil@@ it@@ ary system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the govern@@ ments of the world , and the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the great reli@@ gi@@ ons ."
So what is the ba@@ si@@ c thing that we need to do today ?
"I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful n@@ ations like this one , and where you come from , Eu@@ rop@@ e and so for@@ th , who have in@@ flu@@ ence and who have f@@ ree@@ dom to speak and to act , need to take the respon@@ si@@ bility on y@@ ourselves to be more for@@ ce@@ ful in de@@ man@@ ding an end to r@@ ac@@ i@@ al di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation against gir@@ ls and women all over the world ."
The a@@ verage woman in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t doesn &apos;t have much to say about her d@@ augh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated and so for@@ th .
I didn &apos;t even go down to de@@ ta@@ il about that .
"But I hope that out of this conf@@ er@@ ence , that every woman here will get your h@@ us@@ b@@ ands to real@@ ize that these ab@@ uses on the colle@@ ge ca@@ mp@@ uses and the mil@@ it@@ ary and so for@@ th and in the future job market , need to prot@@ ect your d@@ augh@@ ters and your gr@@ and@@ d@@ augh@@ ters ."
"I have 12 gr@@ and@@ children , four children , and 10 gre@@ at@@ -@@ gr@@ and@@ children , and I think often about them and about the p@@ light that they will face in America , not only if they li@@ ved in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t or a fore@@ i@@ gn country , in having equ@@ al ri@@ ghts , and I hope that all of you will jo@@ in me in being a cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on for women and gir@@ ls around the world and prot@@ ect their human ri@@ ghts ."
Thank you very much .

I had a great education — I &apos;m not comp@@ la@@ ining — but I didn &apos;t have ac@@ cess to a lot of these mu@@ se@@ um@@ s and these ar@@ t@@ works .
"And so when I started tra@@ vel@@ ing and going to these mu@@ se@@ um@@ s , I started learning a lot ."
"And while working at Goo@@ gle , I tried to put this desi@@ re to make it more acc@@ es@@ sible with technology together ."
"So we form@@ ed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this ."
I &apos;m going to probably get into the de@@ m@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since la@@ unch .
"So , simple : you come to Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Ar@@ t@@ P@@ ro@@ j@@ ec@@ t@@ .@@ com@@ ."
You look around at all these mu@@ se@@ um@@ s here .
"You &apos;ve got the U@@ ff@@ iz@@ i , you &apos;ve got the M@@ o@@ M@@ A , the H@@ er@@ m@@ it@@ age , the R@@ i@@ j@@ ks , the V@@ an G@@ o@@ gh ."
"I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ it@@ es , the M@@ et@@ rop@@ ol@@ it@@ an M@@ u@@ se@@ um of Ar@@ t in New York ."
T@@ w@@ o ways of going in — very simple .
"C@@ li@@ ck and , ban@@ g , you &apos;re in this mu@@ se@@ um ."
"It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — B@@ om@@ b@@ ay , M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , it doesn &apos;t really matter ."
"You move around , you have fu@@ n ."
You want to na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate around the mu@@ se@@ um ?
"O@@ p@@ en the pl@@ an up , and , in one c@@ li@@ ck , j@@ um@@ p ."
"You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or ."
K@@ e@@ ep going . H@@ a@@ ve fu@@ n .
E@@ x@@ pl@@ ore .
( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks . I ha@@ ven &apos;t come to the best part .
"( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite pa@@ int@@ ings , &quot; &quot; The H@@ ar@@ ve@@ st@@ ers &quot; &quot; by P@@ i@@ e@@ ter B@@ ru@@ e@@ ge@@ l at the M@@ et ."
I see this pl@@ us si@@ gn .
"If the mu@@ se@@ um has given us the image , you c@@ li@@ ck on it ."
Now this is one of the images .
So this is all of the me@@ ta@@ -@@ data information .
"For those of you who are tru@@ ly interest@@ ed in art , you can c@@ li@@ ck this — but I &apos;m going to c@@ li@@ ck this off right now ."
And this is one of these images that we cap@@ tu@@ red in what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
"So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ."
And I get a lot of people as@@ king me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
You can z@@ oo@@ m around very simply .
You see some fu@@ n stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his ex@@ pres@@ sion is pri@@ c@@ el@@ ess .
But then you really want to go de@@ ep .
"And so I started pla@@ ying around , and I found something going on over here ."
"And I was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ old on . That s@@ ounds interesting . &quot; &quot; W@@ ent in , and I started not@@ ic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something ."
"I did a little research , sp@@ o@@ ke to a couple of my cont@@ ac@@ ts at the M@@ et , and actually found out that this is a ga@@ me called squ@@ all , which inv@@ ol@@ ves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a sti@@ ck on S@@ h@@ ro@@ ve T@@ u@@ es@@ day ."
And ap@@ par@@ ently it was quite pop@@ ular .
"I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it ."
"Now just to get really de@@ ep in , you can really get to the cr@@ ac@@ ks ."
"Now just to give you some per@@ spec@@ tive , I &apos;m going to z@@ oo@@ m out so you really see what you get ."
"H@@ ere is where we were , and this is the pa@@ in@@ ting ."
( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
"So now let &apos;s just quickly j@@ um@@ p into the M@@ o@@ M@@ A , again in New York ."
"So another one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ it@@ es , &quot; &quot; The St@@ ar@@ ry N@@ ight . &quot; &quot; Now the example I sho@@ wed you was all about fin@@ ding de@@ ta@@ il@@ s ."
But what if you want to see br@@ us@@ h st@@ ro@@ kes ?
And what if you want to see how V@@ an G@@ o@@ gh actually created this ma@@ st@@ er@@ piece ?
You z@@ oo@@ m in . You really go in .
"I &apos;m going to go to one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite parts in this pa@@ in@@ ting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cr@@ ac@@ ks ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The St@@ ar@@ ry N@@ ight , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before ."
I &apos;m going to show you my other fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite fe@@ ature .
"There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time ."
This is the real c@@ ool part . It &apos;s called C@@ ol@@ l@@ ec@@ tions .
"A@@ n@@ y one of you , any@@ body — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re ri@@ ch , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a f@@ anc@@ y house — doesn &apos;t matter ."
You can go and create your own mu@@ se@@ um on@@ line — create your own coll@@ ection across all these images .
"@@ V@@ ery simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The P@@ o@@ wer of Z@@ oo@@ m — you can just z@@ oo@@ m around ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The A@@ m@@ b@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ ors , &quot; &quot; based in the N@@ ational G@@ all@@ ery ."
"You can an@@ not@@ ate the stuff , s@@ end it to your friends and really get a conver@@ sa@@ tion going about what you &apos;re feel@@ ing when you go through these ma@@ st@@ er@@ piec@@ es ."
"So I think , in con@@ clu@@ sion , for me , the ma@@ in thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Goo@@ gle ."
"It doesn &apos;t , in my op@@ ini@@ on , even come from the mu@@ se@@ um@@ s ."
I probably sh@@ ouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these arti@@ sts .
And that &apos;s been my hum@@ bl@@ ing experience in this .
"I mean , I hope in this di@@ g@@ ital medi@@ um that we do j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce to their ar@@ t@@ work and re@@ pres@@ ent it pro@@ per@@ ly on@@ line ."
"And the big@@ gest question I get asked no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys is , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you do this to re@@ p@@ li@@ cate the experience of going to a mu@@ se@@ um ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no ."
It &apos;s to supp@@ le@@ ment the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m J@@ an@@ e M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ i@@ g@@ al . I &apos;m a ga@@ me design@@ er .
We do ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve more in ga@@ me wor@@ l@@ ds .
"So , so far , coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely all the Wor@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tual problems of A@@ z@@ er@@ ot@@ h ."
"Now , that &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly a bad thing ."
We &apos;re ev@@ ol@@ ving to be a more coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
And we actually build str@@ on@@ ger social relation@@ shi@@ ps as a resul@@ t .
F@@ i@@ ve million people use it every mon@@ th .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
H@@ is work is bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant .
"But it is not , by any means , an op@@ ti@@ mal situ@@ ation ."
We have to start making the real world work more like a ga@@ me .
"@@ Be@@ fore we had aw@@ es@@ ome ga@@ me contro@@ l@@ l@@ ers , we had sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ les ."
People were su@@ ff@@ ering . People were fi@@ gh@@ ting .
This is really exc@@ iting .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , after 1@@ 8 years the fa@@ m@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al di@@ ce ga@@ me ."
"We want to imagine ep@@ ic w@@ ins , and then give people the means to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve the ep@@ ic w@@ in ."
We made this ga@@ me in 200@@ 7 .
This is an amazing story and adv@@ ent@@ ure for you to go on .
"We &apos;ve got a grap@@ hi@@ c no@@ vel , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in sk@@ ill@@ s like lo@@ cal in@@ si@@ ght , knowle@@ dge net@@ working , su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability , vi@@ sion and re@@ sour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness ."
"M@@ y big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lo@@ ck b@@ illions of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ or@@ m@@ ant inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of t@@ y@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved women .
"And I learned the hard way , the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ ep ."
"T@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years ago , I fa@@ in@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my de@@ s@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ e@@ k@@ b@@ one , I got five sti@@ t@@ ch@@ es on my right ey@@ e ."
And I began the jour@@ ney of re@@ disco@@ ver@@ ing the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I stu@@ died , I met with medi@@ cal doc@@ tors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more insp@@ i@@ red , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new re@@ v@@ olution , this new fe@@ min@@ ist issu@@ e ."
"We are liter@@ ally going to s@@ le@@ ep our way to the top , liter@@ ally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately for men , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation has become a vi@@ ri@@ l@@ ity sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l ."
I was rec@@ ently having din@@ ner with a guy who bra@@ g@@ ged that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four hours s@@ le@@ ep the night before .
"And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this din@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a brea@@ k@@ fa@@ st d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about e@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re like@@ ly to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck is too l@@ ate for me , but that &apos;s o@@ kay , I can get a ga@@ me of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few conf@@ er@@ ence call@@ s and me@@ et you at e@@ ight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly bus@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the tru@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant lead@@ ers in business , in fin@@ ance , in poli@@ tics , making ter@@ ri@@ ble deci@@ sions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good lead@@ er , because the ess@@ ence of lead@@ er@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs h@@ it@@ ting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ics .
"In fact , I have a feel@@ ing that if L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ ist@@ ers , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) W@@ hi@@ le all the bro@@ thers were bus@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ connec@@ ted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a si@@ ster would have not@@ ic@@ ed the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g , because she would have w@@ o@@ ken up from a se@@ ven@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or e@@ igh@@ t-@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the mul@@ ti@@ ple cri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a pers@@ onal level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , gra@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your eyes and disco@@ ver the great ideas that li@@ e inside us , to sh@@ ut your engin@@ es and disco@@ ver the power of s@@ le@@ ep ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Well , as Ch@@ r@@ is po@@ in@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the fun@@ c@@ tions and structure of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a min@@ u@@ te about what this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
"H@@ ere is this ma@@ ss of j@@ el@@ ly , th@@ ree@@ -@@ p@@ ound ma@@ ss of j@@ el@@ ly you can h@@ old in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand , and it can con@@ te@@ mp@@ l@@ ate the va@@ st@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ lar space ."
It can con@@ te@@ mp@@ l@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can con@@ te@@ mp@@ l@@ ate itself con@@ te@@ mp@@ l@@ ating on the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the ho@@ ly gra@@ il of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , of ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logy , and hop@@ e@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous org@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little wi@@ sp@@ s of prot@@ op@@ la@@ s@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this acti@@ vity e@@ mer@@ ges the whole spec@@ tr@@ um of ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties that we call human nature and human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the fun@@ c@@ tions of the human brain ."
"One appro@@ ach , the one we use ma@@ in@@ ly , is to look at patients with su@@ sta@@ ined da@@ ma@@ ge to a small regi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gen@@ e@@ tic change in a small regi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an ac@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your co@@ gn@@ i@@ tive ability ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly sel@@ ective l@@ os@@ s of one fun@@ c@@ tion , with other fun@@ c@@ tions being pre@@ ser@@ ved int@@ act , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ dence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how inv@@ olved in medi@@ ating that fun@@ c@@ tion ."
"So you can then ma@@ p fun@@ c@@ tion on@@ to structure , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular fun@@ c@@ tion ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king exa@@ mp@@ les of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m giving you three exa@@ mp@@ les , six minutes each , during this talk ."
The first example is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the te@@ mp@@ or@@ al lob@@ es , fron@@ t@@ al lob@@ es , par@@ i@@ et@@ al lob@@ es , O@@ K — the lob@@ es that con@@ stitu@@ te the brain ."
"And if you look , tu@@ c@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner sur@@ face of the te@@ mp@@ or@@ al lob@@ es — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face are@@ a in the brain , because when it &apos;s da@@ ma@@ ged , you can no longer recogn@@ ize people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still recogn@@ ize them from their vo@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h y@@ eah , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even recogn@@ ize yourself in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you w@@ ink and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really recogn@@ ize yourself as yourself ."
O@@ K . Now that sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is well known as ca@@ used by da@@ ma@@ ge to the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few physi@@ ci@@ ans have heard about it , not even ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logi@@ sts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , and that is a pati@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ mal , has had a head in@@ j@@ ury , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ mal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an imp@@ os@@ tor ."
"S@@ he &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly l@@ u@@ ci@@ d and int@@ elli@@ g@@ ent in all other re@@ spec@@ ts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his d@@ el@@ u@@ sion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pre@@ tation of this , which you find in all the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ry t@@ ex@@ t@@ boo@@ ks , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same ar@@ gu@@ ment app@@ lies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys ."
"When you &apos;re a little bab@@ y , a young bab@@ y , you had a str@@ ong se@@ x@@ u@@ al at@@ tr@@ action to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us comple@@ x of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the st@@ and@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank G@@ od , or you would all be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , da@@ ma@@ ging the cor@@ te@@ x , allo@@ wing these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to e@@ mer@@ ge , f@@ la@@ m@@ ing to the sur@@ face , and su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly and in@@ exp@@ li@@ ca@@ bly you find yourself being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; My G@@ od , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an imp@@ os@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pre@@ tation that makes sense to your da@@ ma@@ ged brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this ar@@ gu@@ ment ."
"It &apos;s very in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , a pati@@ ent having the same d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , about his pe@@ t p@@ oo@@ d@@ le . ( Laughter )@@ "
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ i@@ f@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ i@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the l@@ at@@ ent be@@ sti@@ ality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to expla@@ in this cu@@ ri@@ ous dis@@ order , we look at the structure and fun@@ c@@ tions of the nor@@ mal vi@@ su@@ al pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , vi@@ su@@ al sign@@ als come in , into the ey@@ e@@ b@@ all@@ s , go to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vi@@ sion , and after pro@@ cess@@ ing all that , the messa@@ ge goes to a small structure called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , where you per@@ cei@@ ve fac@@ es ."
There are neur@@ ons there that are sen@@ si@@ tive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face are@@ a of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that are@@ a &apos;s da@@ ma@@ ged , you l@@ ose the ability to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that are@@ a , the messa@@ ge ca@@ s@@ ca@@ des into a structure called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emoti@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , and that structure , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , g@@ au@@ ges the emoti@@ onal sign@@ i@@ fic@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ dat@@ or ? I@@ s it m@@ ate ?
"O@@ r is it something ab@@ solu@@ tely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of l@@ int , or a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? O@@ K ?"
Wh@@ ich you can completely i@@ gn@@ ore .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is exc@@ ited , and this is something important , the messa@@ ges then ca@@ s@@ ca@@ de into the au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fa@@ ster .
You start s@@ we@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from m@@ us@@ cu@@ lar ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ tun@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ t@@ ro@@ des on your p@@ al@@ m and meas@@ ure the change in sk@@ in re@@ sist@@ ance produc@@ ed by s@@ we@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exc@@ ited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ous@@ ed , or not , O@@ K ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a min@@ u@@ te .
"So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an ob@@ ject , when he looks at his — any ob@@ ject for that matter , it goes to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as and , ho@@ we@@ ver , and it &apos;s pro@@ cess@@ ed in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , and you recogn@@ ize it as a pe@@ a pl@@ ant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , O@@ K ?"
"And then the messa@@ ge ca@@ s@@ ca@@ des into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , and then goes down the au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that w@@ ire that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emoti@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , is c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So because the fu@@ si@@ form is int@@ act , the cha@@ p can still recogn@@ ize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h y@@ eah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the w@@ ire is c@@ ut to the emoti@@ onal cen@@ ters , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? R@@ ight ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ exp@@ li@@ ca@@ ble l@@ ack of emoti@@ ons ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some str@@ an@@ ge woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a scre@@ en , and meas@@ ure your g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can meas@@ ure how you s@@ we@@ at when you see an ob@@ ject , like a table or an um@@ b@@ re@@ l@@ l@@ a . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t s@@ we@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a li@@ on , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start s@@ we@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about nor@@ mal people — you start s@@ we@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ w@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this pati@@ ent ?"
You take the pati@@ ent and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and meas@@ ure his g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and cha@@ ir@@ s and l@@ int , nothing happens , as in nor@@ mal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is fl@@ at ."
"There &apos;s no emoti@@ onal re@@ action to his mother , because that w@@ ire going from the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as to the emoti@@ onal cen@@ ters is c@@ ut ."
"So his vi@@ sion is nor@@ mal because the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as are nor@@ mal , his emoti@@ ons are nor@@ mal — he &apos;ll la@@ u@@ gh , he &apos;ll c@@ ry , so on and so for@@ th — but the w@@ ire from vi@@ sion to emoti@@ ons is c@@ ut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this d@@ el@@ u@@ sion that his mother is an imp@@ os@@ tor ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ vely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , see@@ min@@ g@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sible , ne@@ ural p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome and say that the st@@ and@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a pre@@ ci@@ se ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known ne@@ ural an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pati@@ ent then goes , and mother ph@@ ones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pic@@ ks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? Wh@@ ere are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no d@@ el@@ u@@ sion through the phone ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate pa@@ th@@ way going from the hear@@ ing cen@@ ters in the brain to the emoti@@ onal cen@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So this expla@@ ins why through the phone he recogn@@ iz@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an imp@@ os@@ tor ."
"O@@ K , how is all this comple@@ x cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we appro@@ ach this problem by consi@@ der@@ ing another cu@@ ri@@ ous sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is a@@ mp@@ ut@@ ated , or a le@@ g is a@@ mp@@ ut@@ ated , for g@@ an@@ gr@@ en@@ e , or you l@@ ose it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a ser@@ i@@ ous problem — you contin@@ ue to vi@@ vi@@ d@@ ly feel the pres@@ ence of that mi@@ ssing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m with almost any part of the body ."
"@@ Be@@ li@@ e@@ ve it or not , even with inter@@ n@@ al vi@@ sc@@ er@@ a ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the u@@ ter@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ st@@ er@@ ec@@ tom@@ y — who have a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m u@@ ter@@ us , inclu@@ ding ph@@ an@@ to@@ m men@@ str@@ u@@ al cra@@ mp@@ s at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stud@@ ent asked me the other day , &quot; D@@ o they get ph@@ an@@ to@@ m P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ p@@ e for scienti@@ fic en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b@@ s by doing exper@@ im@@ ents ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b@@ s cla@@ i@@ m that they can move the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll wa@@ ve go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
"Th@@ ese are very comp@@ elling , vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sa@@ tions ."
The pati@@ ent &apos;s not d@@ el@@ usi@@ onal .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s a comp@@ elling sen@@ s@@ ory experience for the pati@@ ent ."
"But ho@@ we@@ ver , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a cl@@ en@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pa@@ in@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pa@@ in will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ?"
It s@@ ounds like an o@@ x@@ y@@ mor@@ on .
"But when we were looking at the case sh@@ e@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b@@ s , the ori@@ gin@@ al ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed because of the per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ j@@ ury ."
"The ac@@ tual ner@@ ve su@@ p@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m was se@@ vered , was c@@ ut , by say , a m@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So the pati@@ ent had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , which is pa@@ in@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ i@@ ded at@@ te@@ mp@@ t to get ri@@ d of the pa@@ in in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on a@@ mp@@ ut@@ ates the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m with the same pa@@ ins , right ?"
And this is a ser@@ i@@ ous cl@@ ini@@ cal problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become de@@ pre@@ ssed .
"S@@ ome of them are dri@@ ven to su@@ ici@@ de , O@@ K ?"
"So , how do you tre@@ at this sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case sh@@ e@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves su@@ p@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m had been c@@ ut , and the ac@@ tual ar@@ m had been par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , and l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for se@@ ver@@ al months before the a@@ mp@@ u@@ tation , and this pa@@ in then gets car@@ ri@@ ed over into the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was int@@ act , but par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , the brain sen@@ ds comm@@ ands to the ar@@ m , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve . No . M@@ o@@ ve . No . M@@ o@@ ve . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , O@@ K ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ e@@ b@@ bi@@ an , as@@ soci@@ ative l@@ ink , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ sa@@ tion of a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve a@@ mp@@ ut@@ ated the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is car@@ ri@@ es over into your body image and into your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m , O@@ K ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"@@ How do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , so you can reli@@ e@@ ve him of this exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating , cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now s@@ end the comm@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m , but give him vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ a@@ ybe you can reli@@ e@@ ve the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m pa@@ in , the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m cra@@ m@@ p ."
"@@ How do you do that ? Well , vir@@ tual reality ."
But that cos@@ ts m@@ illions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fund@@ ing ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) O@@ K ? What you do is you create what I call a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r box .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard box with a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r in the middle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m — so my first pati@@ ent , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m a@@ mp@@ ut@@ ated 10 years ago .
"He had a br@@ ac@@ hi@@ al a@@ v@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were c@@ ut and the ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was a@@ mp@@ ut@@ ated ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m , exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pa@@ in@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r like that , in a box , which I call a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r box , right ?"
"And the pati@@ ent pu@@ ts his ph@@ an@@ to@@ m left ar@@ m , which is cl@@ en@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and the nor@@ mal hand on the right side of the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the cl@@ en@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m being re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ fl@@ ection of the nor@@ mal ar@@ m in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ to@@ m has been re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wi@@ g@@ gle your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m — your real fin@@ g@@ ers , or move your real fin@@ g@@ ers while looking in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vi@@ su@@ al imp@@ re@@ s@@ sion that the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is moving , right ?"
"That &apos;s obvi@@ ous , but the a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ shing thing is , the pati@@ ent then says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is moving again , and the pa@@ in , the cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first pati@@ ent who came in — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) My first pati@@ ent came in , and he looked in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k at your re@@ fl@@ ection of your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ g@@ g@@ ling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ p@@ id . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r re@@ fl@@ ection , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ s@@ ory experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve your nor@@ mal hand and ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . You know that . It &apos;s pa@@ in@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve your nor@@ mal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !@@ "
And my pa@@ in is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ l@@ ose your eyes . &quot; &quot; He clos@@ es his eyes ."
&quot; And move your nor@@ mal hand . &quot;
"@@ &quot; O@@ h , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ en@@ ched again . &quot;"
"@@ &quot; O@@ K , open your eyes . &quot;"
"@@ &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , o@@ h my G@@ od , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a k@@ id in a can@@ dy st@@ ore ."
"So , I said , O@@ K , this pro@@ ves my the@@ ory about learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is and the cri@@ tical ro@@ le of vi@@ su@@ al in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely us@@ el@@ ess ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )@@ "
"But then I started real@@ iz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is that you see in ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logy , like st@@ ro@@ ke , fo@@ cal d@@ y@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ as — there may be a learned comp@@ on@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple dev@@ ice of using a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , D@@ er@@ e@@ k &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his pa@@ in — I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , take it home and pr@@ acti@@ ce with it for a week or two ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe , after a per@@ i@@ od of pr@@ acti@@ ce , you can di@@ sp@@ en@@ se with the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , and start moving your par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m , and then , reli@@ e@@ ve yourself of pa@@ in . &quot; &quot; So he said O@@ K , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ a@@ ke it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he ph@@ ones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s g@@ one . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s g@@ one ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r box was g@@ one ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ to@@ m I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ri@@ ed , I said , my G@@ od , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human sub@@ jects , e@@ th@@ ics and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ er@@ e@@ k , does this b@@ other you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no ph@@ an@@ to@@ m el@@ b@@ ow pa@@ in , no cl@@ en@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ to@@ m fore@@ ar@@ m pa@@ in , all those pa@@ ins are g@@ one away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m fin@@ g@@ ers d@@ ang@@ ling from the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and your box doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my fore@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and e@@ li@@ min@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m fin@@ g@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of ma@@ g@@ ici@@ an ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous sen@@ s@@ ory conf@@ lic@@ t .
It &apos;s getting messa@@ ges from vi@@ sion saying the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , m@@ us@@ cle sign@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this conf@@ lic@@ t , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ to@@ m , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of den@@ i@@ al — it g@@ ates the sign@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s , the b@@ on@@ us is , the pa@@ in dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s because you can &apos;t have dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died pa@@ in flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the b@@ on@@ us ."
"Now , this tech@@ ni@@ que has been tried on do@@ z@@ ens of patients by other grou@@ ps in H@@ el@@ s@@ in@@ k@@ i , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a tre@@ at@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ to@@ m pa@@ in , and in@@ de@@ ed , people have tried it for st@@ ro@@ ke re@@ ha@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ ation ."
"S@@ t@@ ro@@ ke you nor@@ m@@ ally think of as da@@ ma@@ ge to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some comp@@ on@@ ent of st@@ ro@@ ke par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is is also learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , and maybe that comp@@ on@@ ent can be over@@ come using m@@ ir@@ r@@ ors ."
"This has also g@@ one through cl@@ ini@@ cal tri@@ als , help@@ ing lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ wit@@ ch ge@@ ar@@ s now to the third part of my talk , which is about another cu@@ ri@@ ous ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
This was disco@@ vered by F@@ r@@ anc@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the n@@ in@@ e@@ te@@ en@@ th century .
He was a cou@@ s@@ in of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in .
"He po@@ in@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ mal , had the follo@@ wing p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s co@@ lo@@ red ."
"F@@ i@@ ve is bl@@ ue , seven is y@@ el@@ low , e@@ ight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is in@@ di@@ go , O@@ K ?"
"B@@ ear in mind , these people are completely nor@@ mal in other re@@ spec@@ ts ."
"O@@ r C shar@@ p — sometimes , t@@ ones ev@@ o@@ ke col@@ or ."
"@@ C shar@@ p is bl@@ ue , F shar@@ p is green , another t@@ one might be y@@ el@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a . G@@ al@@ ton called it sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a , a min@@ g@@ ling of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dist@@ inc@@ t ."
These people mu@@ ddle up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ p@@ ects of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a run@@ s in fami@@ lies , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a her@@ ed@@ it@@ ary b@@ as@@ is , a gen@@ e@@ tic b@@ as@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the ma@@ in the@@ me of this l@@ ec@@ ture , which is about cre@@ ati@@ vity — sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a is e@@ ight times more common am@@ ong arti@@ sts , po@@ ets , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ? What ca@@ uses it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ or@@ ies ."
One the@@ ory is they &apos;re just cra@@ z@@ y .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scienti@@ fic the@@ ory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther the@@ ory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ k@@ ies and po@@ the@@ a@@ ds , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tru@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an D@@ i@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ K . Now , the third the@@ ory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a . All right ?"
"So , we found that the col@@ or are@@ a and the number are@@ a are right next to each other in the brain , in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ental c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing between col@@ or and numbers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be c@@ ros@@ sed wi@@ res in some people ?
Re@@ member I said it run@@ s in fami@@ lies ?
That gi@@ ves you the cl@@ ue .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ nor@@ mal gen@@ e , a mu@@ tation in the gen@@ e that ca@@ uses this ab@@ nor@@ mal c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain regi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other regi@@ on , and these are tri@@ mm@@ ed down to create the char@@ acter@@ is@@ tic mo@@ du@@ lar archit@@ ec@@ ture of the ad@@ ult brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e ca@@ using this tri@@ mm@@ ing and if that gen@@ e m@@ ut@@ ates , then you get de@@ f@@ ici@@ ent tri@@ mm@@ ing between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and col@@ or , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ col@@ or sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and col@@ or , you get t@@ on@@ e-@@ col@@ or sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pre@@ ssed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ connec@@ ted ?"
"Well , think about what arti@@ sts , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and po@@ ets have in common , the ability to eng@@ age in me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ori@@ cal thinking , l@@ in@@ king see@@ min@@ g@@ ly un@@ re@@ l@@ ated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the ea@@ st , and J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the S@@ u@@ n . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the su@@ n , does that mean she &apos;s a g@@ lo@@ wing b@@ all of fir@@ e ?"
"I mean , sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ en@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"N@@ or@@ mal people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the su@@ n , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the su@@ n , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the su@@ n ."
"I@@ n@@ st@@ antly , you &apos;ve found the l@@ in@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this gre@@ ater c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a gre@@ ater pro@@ p@@ en@@ sity to@@ wards me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ori@@ cal thinking and cre@@ ati@@ vity in people with sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"And , h@@ ence , the e@@ ight times more common in@@ ci@@ dence of sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a am@@ ong po@@ ets , arti@@ sts and no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ r@@ en@@ o@@ logical view of sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
The last de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion — can I take one min@@ u@@ te ?
"( Applause ) O@@ K . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ t@@ es , but you &apos;re in den@@ i@@ al about it ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s what I call Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t . J@@ ust like your al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent sh@@ ap@@ es for different ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , right ?"
"H@@ ere , you &apos;ve got Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t ."
"One of them is K@@ i@@ k@@ i , one of them is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ."
Wh@@ ich one is K@@ i@@ k@@ i and which one is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ i@@ k@@ i and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two m@@ ut@@ ants ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a , that &apos;s K@@ i@@ k@@ i ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands ."
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ n@@ ine percent of you .
"Now , n@@ one of you is a Mar@@ ti@@ an . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ model sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ tic ab@@ str@@ action , me@@ an@@ ing you &apos;re saying that that shar@@ p in@@ fl@@ ection — ki@@ -@@ k@@ i , in your au@@ d@@ it@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x , the ha@@ ir cells being exc@@ ited — K@@ i@@ k@@ i , mi@@ m@@ ics the vi@@ su@@ al in@@ fl@@ ection , su@@ dd@@ en in@@ fl@@ ection of that j@@ ag@@ ged sh@@ ape ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is eng@@ ag@@ ing in a pri@@ mi@@ tive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a si@@ l@@ ly ill@@ u@@ sion , but these phot@@ ons in your ey@@ e are doing this sh@@ ape , and ha@@ ir cells in your ear are exc@@ iting the au@@ d@@ it@@ ory pat@@ ter@@ n , but the brain is able to ex@@ tr@@ act the common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator ."
"It &apos;s a pri@@ mi@@ tive form of ab@@ str@@ action , and we now know this happens in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us of the brain , because when that &apos;s da@@ ma@@ ged , these people l@@ ose the ability to eng@@ age in B@@ ou@@ b@@ a K@@ i@@ k@@ i , but they also l@@ ose the ability to eng@@ age in me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that g@@ lit@@ ters is not go@@ ld , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The pati@@ ent says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s me@@ tal@@ li@@ c and sh@@ in@@ y , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s go@@ ld ."
"You have to meas@@ ure its speci@@ fic gra@@ vity , O@@ K ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely mi@@ ss the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ori@@ cal me@@ an@@ ing ."
"So , this are@@ a is about e@@ ight times the size in high@@ er — esp@@ eci@@ ally in humans — as in lo@@ wer pri@@ mat@@ es ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very interesting is going on here in the an@@ gu@@ lar g@@ y@@ r@@ us , because it &apos;s the c@@ ros@@ s@@ ro@@ a@@ ds between hear@@ ing , vi@@ sion and tou@@ ch , and it became en@@ or@@ mous in humans . And something very interesting is going on ."
"And I think it &apos;s a b@@ as@@ is of many uni@@ qu@@ ely human ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties like ab@@ str@@ action , me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"A@@ ll of these questions that ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ers have been stud@@ ying for m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ a , we scientists can beg@@ in to expl@@ ore by doing brain ima@@ ging , and by stud@@ ying patients and as@@ king the right questions ."

"P@@ r@@ om@@ is@@ ing to give ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions of pa@@ int@@ ings , I shi@@ pp@@ ed my pa@@ in@@ ts and ar@@ ri@@ ved in Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ ali@@ pur@@ am ."
The de@@ ad@@ line for the show ar@@ ri@@ ved — my pa@@ in@@ ts didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fi@@ shing v@@ il@@ la@@ ge was fa@@ mous for sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture .
So I tried br@@ on@@ ze ca@@ sting .
But to make large for@@ ms was too hea@@ v@@ y and exp@@ en@@ sive .
"I went for a walk on the be@@ ach , wat@@ ching the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men b@@ und@@ le their ne@@ ts into m@@ ounds on the s@@ and ."
"I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differ@@ ently — a new appro@@ ach to sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture , a way to make v@@ olu@@ me@@ tri@@ c form without hea@@ v@@ y so@@ li@@ d materi@@ als ."
My first sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture was made in coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation with these fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men .
It &apos;s a self-@@ por@@ tra@@ it ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ de H@@ i@@ ps . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We ho@@ ist@@ ed them on pol@@ es to photograp@@ h .
I disco@@ vered their so@@ ft sur@@ fac@@ es re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed every ri@@ pp@@ le of w@@ ind in con@@ st@@ antly chan@@ ging pat@@ ter@@ ns .
I was mes@@ mer@@ ized .
"I contin@@ u@@ ed stud@@ ying cra@@ ft tra@@ di@@ tions and coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ating with ar@@ tis@@ ans , next in L@@ i@@ th@@ u@@ an@@ ia with l@@ ace ma@@ kers ."
"I li@@ ked the f@@ ine de@@ ta@@ il it gave my work , but I wanted to make them lar@@ ger — to shi@@ ft from being an ob@@ ject you look at to something you could get lost in ."
"@@ Re@@ tur@@ ning to In@@ dia to work with those fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men , we made a net of a million and a half h@@ and@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots — inst@@ all@@ ed bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d ."
"Th@@ ous@@ ands of people saw it , and one of them was the ur@@ ban@@ ist M@@ an@@ u@@ al S@@ o@@ la@@ -@@ M@@ or@@ al@@ es who was re@@ design@@ ing the wat@@ er@@ front in P@@ or@@ to , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al ."
He asked if I could build this as a per@@ man@@ ent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and pre@@ ser@@ ve my art .
"D@@ ur@@ able , engine@@ ered , per@@ man@@ ent — those are in op@@ pos@@ ition to i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ cra@@ tic , deli@@ cate and e@@ ph@@ e@@ mer@@ al ."
"For two years , I sear@@ ched for a fi@@ ber that could survi@@ ve ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ra@@ ys , s@@ al@@ t , air , pol@@ l@@ u@@ tion , and at the same time re@@ ma@@ in so@@ ft enough to move flu@@ id@@ ly in the w@@ ind ."
We needed something to h@@ old the net up out there in the middle of the tra@@ ff@@ ic cir@@ cle .
"So we ra@@ is@@ ed this 4@@ 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ ound ste@@ el r@@ ing ."
We had to engine@@ er it to move gr@@ ace@@ fully in an a@@ verage b@@ ree@@ ze and survi@@ ve in h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e win@@ ds .
But there was no engine@@ ering so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to model something por@@ ous and moving .
I found a bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical engine@@ er who design@@ s sa@@ il@@ s for America &apos;s C@@ up r@@ ac@@ ing y@@ ach@@ ts nam@@ ed Pe@@ ter H@@ ep@@ pe@@ l .
He help@@ ed me t@@ ack@@ le the tw@@ in challen@@ ges of pre@@ ci@@ se sh@@ ape and g@@ ent@@ le move@@ ment .
I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because h@@ and@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots wer@@ en &apos;t going to with@@ st@@ and a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e .
"So I develop@@ ed a relation@@ ship with an indu@@ stri@@ al fi@@ sh@@ net fac@@ t@@ ory , learned the vari@@ ab@@ les of their mach@@ ines , and fi@@ gu@@ red out a way to make l@@ ace with them ."
"There was no language to trans@@ l@@ ate this anci@@ ent , i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ cra@@ tic h@@ and@@ cra@@ ft into something machine oper@@ at@@ ors could pro@@ duce ."
So we had to create one .
"Th@@ ree years and two children later , we ra@@ is@@ ed this 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ squ@@ are@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t l@@ ace net ."
"It was hard to believe that what I had ima@@ gin@@ ed was now built , per@@ man@@ ent and had lost nothing in trans@@ lation ."
( Applause ) This inter@@ sec@@ tion had been bl@@ and and an@@ on@@ y@@ mous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I wal@@ ked under@@ ne@@ ath it for the first time .
"As I wat@@ ched the w@@ ind &apos;s cho@@ re@@ ograp@@ h@@ y un@@ fo@@ ld , I felt sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed and , at the same time , connec@@ ted to lim@@ it@@ less sk@@ y ."
My life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these o@@ ases of sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture in sp@@ ac@@ es of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share two direc@@ tions that are new in my work .
"H@@ i@@ stor@@ ic P@@ h@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ p@@ hi@@ a C@@ ity H@@ all : its pla@@ z@@ a , I felt , needed a materi@@ al for sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture that was li@@ gh@@ ter than ne@@ tting ."
"So we exper@@ im@@ en@@ ted with tin@@ y at@@ om@@ ized water par@@ ti@@ cl@@ es to create a d@@ ry mi@@ st that is sh@@ ap@@ ed by the w@@ ind and in te@@ sting , disco@@ vered that it can be sh@@ ap@@ ed by people who can inter@@ act and move through it without getting w@@ et ."
I &apos;m using this sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture materi@@ al to tr@@ ace the pa@@ ths of sub@@ way tra@@ ins ab@@ o@@ ve ground in real time — like an X@@ -@@ r@@ ay of the city &apos;s cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory system un@@ fol@@ ding .
"N@@ ext challenge , the B@@ i@@ en@@ ni@@ al of the Amer@@ i@@ ca@@ s in D@@ en@@ ver asked , could I re@@ pres@@ ent the 3@@ 5 n@@ ations of the W@@ est@@ er@@ n he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here and their inter@@ connec@@ te@@ d@@ ness in a sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture ?"
"( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to beg@@ in , but I said y@@ es ."
I read about the rec@@ ent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke in C@@ hi@@ le and the t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i that ri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed across the entire P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic O@@ ce@@ an .
"It shi@@ f@@ ted the Earth &apos;s t@@ ec@@ t@@ on@@ ic pl@@ ates , sp@@ ed up the planet &apos;s r@@ ot@@ ation and liter@@ ally sh@@ ort@@ en@@ ed the l@@ eng@@ th of the day ."
"So I cont@@ ac@@ ted N@@ O@@ A@@ A , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i , and trans@@ l@@ ated it into this ."
I@@ ts ti@@ tle : &quot; &quot; 1@@ .@@ 2@@ 6 &quot; &quot; re@@ f@@ ers to the number of mic@@ ros@@ econ@@ ds that the Earth &apos;s day was sh@@ ort@@ en@@ ed .
"I couldn &apos;t build this with a ste@@ el r@@ ing , the way I knew ."
I@@ ts sh@@ ape was too comple@@ x now .
"So I re@@ plac@@ ed the me@@ t@@ al ar@@ mat@@ ure with a so@@ ft , f@@ ine mes@@ h of a fi@@ ber 15 times str@@ on@@ ger than ste@@ el ."
"The sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture could now be enti@@ re@@ ly so@@ ft , which made it so light it could ti@@ e in to ex@@ ist@@ ing buil@@ d@@ ings — liter@@ ally be@@ coming part of the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the city ."
There was no so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that could ex@@ tru@@ de these comple@@ x net for@@ ms and model them with gra@@ vity .
So we had to create it .
Th@@ en I got a call from New York C@@ ity as@@ king if I could ad@@ ap@@ t these con@@ cep@@ ts to T@@ im@@ es S@@ qu@@ are or the H@@ i@@ gh L@@ ine .
This new so@@ ft struc@@ tur@@ al me@@ th@@ od en@@ ab@@ les me to model these and build these sc@@ ul@@ p@@ tures at the scale of sk@@ y@@ sc@@ r@@ ap@@ ers .
"They don &apos;t have fund@@ ing yet , but I dre@@ am now of br@@ ing@@ ing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed ."
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I sear@@ ched for beau@@ ty in the tra@@ di@@ tional things , in cra@@ ft for@@ ms ."
"Now I com@@ b@@ ine them with hi@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h materi@@ als and engine@@ ering to create v@@ olu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous , b@@ il@@ lo@@ wing for@@ ms the scale of buil@@ d@@ ings ."
My arti@@ stic hor@@ iz@@ ons contin@@ ue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x .
"A@@ n att@@ or@@ ney in the off@@ ice who &apos;d never been interest@@ ed in art , never vi@@ s@@ ited the lo@@ cal art mu@@ se@@ um , dra@@ g@@ ged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to li@@ e down under@@ ne@@ ath the sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture ."
"There they were in their business su@@ its , la@@ ying in the gra@@ ss , not@@ ic@@ ing the chan@@ ging pat@@ ter@@ ns of w@@ ind be@@ side people they didn &apos;t know , shar@@ ing the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The way to read this sli@@ de is to look at your age on the hor@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ al a@@ x@@ is .
"A@@ f@@ ter pu@@ ber@@ ty , we f@@ all off the ma@@ p ."
She &apos;s a si@@ x@@ -@@ mon@@ ther .
( Applause )
So when I was a k@@ id ...
this was my team .
( Laughter ) I st@@ un@@ k at sp@@ or@@ ts .
"I didn &apos;t like to play them , I didn &apos;t like to wat@@ ch them ."
So this is what I did . I went fi@@ shing .
"And for all of my gro@@ wing up I fi@@ shed on the sho@@ res of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut , and these are the cre@@ at@@ u@@ res that I saw on a re@@ gu@@ lar b@@ as@@ is ."
"But after I gre@@ w up and went to colle@@ ge , and I came home in the early 9@@ 0 &apos;s , this is what I found ."
My team had sh@@ run@@ k .
It was like liter@@ ally having your ros@@ ter de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
"And as I sort of looked into that , from a very pers@@ onal point of view as a fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man , I started to kind of figure out , well , what was the rest of the world thinking about it ?"
F@@ ir@@ st place I started to look was fish mar@@ ke@@ ts .
"And when I went to fish mar@@ ke@@ ts , in sp@@ ite of where I was — whether I was in Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ a , or P@@ ar@@ is , or L@@ on@@ don , or wh@@ er@@ ever — I ke@@ pt seeing this we@@ ir@@ d@@ ly re@@ pe@@ ating t@@ rop@@ e of four cre@@ at@@ u@@ res , again and again — on the men@@ us , on ice — sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , tun@@ a , s@@ al@@ m@@ on and co@@ d ."
"And I thought this was pretty str@@ an@@ ge , and as I looked at it , I was wonder@@ ing , did any@@ one else not@@ ice this sort of sh@@ r@@ in@@ king of the market ?"
"Well , when I looked into it , I realized that people didn &apos;t look at it as their team ."
"O@@ r@@ din@@ ary people , the way they looked at se@@ af@@ ood was like this ."
It &apos;s not an un@@ u@@ su@@ al human char@@ acter@@ is@@ tic to re@@ duce the natural world down to very few el@@ em@@ ents .
"We did it before , 1@@ 0,000 years ago , when we came out of our ca@@ ves ."
"If you look at fir@@ e p@@ its from 1@@ 0,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see r@@ ac@@ co@@ ons , you &apos;ll see , you know , w@@ ol@@ ves , you &apos;ll see all kinds of different cre@@ at@@ u@@ res ."
"But if you t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e to the age of — you know , 2@@ ,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see these four ma@@ mm@@ als : pi@@ gs , co@@ ws , sh@@ e@@ ep and go@@ ats ."
"It &apos;s true of bir@@ ds , too ."
"You look at the men@@ us in New York C@@ ity re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ants 1@@ 50 years ago , 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see s@@ ni@@ p@@ e , w@@ oo@@ d@@ co@@ ck , grou@@ se , do@@ z@@ ens of duc@@ ks , do@@ z@@ ens of ge@@ ese ."
"But t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e a@@ head to the age of mo@@ der@@ n an@@ ima@@ l h@@ us@@ b@@ and@@ ry , and you &apos;ll see four : tur@@ ke@@ ys , duc@@ ks , ch@@ ic@@ ken and ge@@ ese ."
So it makes sense that we &apos;ve hea@@ ded in this direc@@ tion .
But how have we hea@@ ded in this direc@@ tion ?
Well ...
"@@ first it &apos;s a very , very new problem ."
This is the way we &apos;ve been fi@@ shing the oce@@ ans over the last 50 years .
Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I was a tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous inc@@ enti@@ ve to ar@@ m ourselves in a war against fish .
"A@@ ll of the technology that we per@@ f@@ ected during Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I — s@@ on@@ ar , li@@ gh@@ twe@@ ight pol@@ y@@ m@@ ers — all these things were re@@ direc@@ ted to@@ wards fish ."
"And so you see this tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous buil@@ d@@ up in fi@@ shing cap@@ ac@@ ity , qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ pl@@ ing in the course of time , from the end of Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I to the pres@@ ent time ."
And right now that means we &apos;re taking between 80 and 9@@ 0 million me@@ tri@@ c t@@ ons out of the se@@ a every year .
That &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the human we@@ ight of China taken out of the se@@ a every year .
And it &apos;s no co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence that I use China as the example because China is now the lar@@ gest fi@@ shing n@@ ation in the world .
"Well , that &apos;s only half the story ."
"The other half of the story is this incredi@@ ble boo@@ m in fish far@@ m@@ ing and a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , which is now , only in the last year or two , star@@ ting to ex@@ ce@@ ed the amount of wi@@ ld fish that we pro@@ duce ."
"So that if you ad@@ d wi@@ ld fish and far@@ med fish together , you get the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of two Chin@@ as created from the oce@@ an each and every year ."
"And again , it &apos;s not a co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence that I use China as the example , because China , in ad@@ di@@ tion to being the big@@ gest ca@@ t@@ ch@@ er of fish , is also the big@@ gest far@@ m@@ er of fish ."
So let &apos;s look though at the four cho@@ ices we are making right now .
"The first one — by far the most con@@ su@@ med se@@ af@@ ood in America and in much of the W@@ est , is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p ."
S@@ h@@ ri@@ m@@ p in the wi@@ ld — as a wi@@ ld produc@@ t — is a ter@@ ri@@ ble produc@@ t .
"@@ 5 , 10 , 15 p@@ ounds of wi@@ ld fish are re@@ g@@ ul@@ arly kill@@ ed to bring one p@@ ound of sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p to the market ."
They &apos;re also incredi@@ bly fu@@ el in@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent to bring to the market .
"In a rec@@ ent study that was produc@@ ed out of D@@ al@@ h@@ ou@@ si@@ e U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sity , it was found that dra@@ g@@ ging for sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p is one of the most car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive ways of fi@@ shing that you can find ."
"So you can far@@ m them , and people do far@@ m them , and they far@@ m them a lot in this very are@@ a ."
P@@ ro@@ b@@ le@@ m is ...
the place where you far@@ m sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p is in these wi@@ ld ha@@ b@@ it@@ ats — in man@@ gro@@ ve fore@@ sts .
Now look at those lo@@ vely ro@@ ots coming down .
"Th@@ ose are the things that h@@ old so@@ il together , prot@@ ect co@@ a@@ sts , create ha@@ b@@ it@@ ats for all sor@@ ts of young fish , young sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , all sor@@ ts of things that are important to this environment ."
"Well , this is what happens to a lot of co@@ a@@ st@@ al man@@ gro@@ ve fore@@ sts ."
We &apos;ve lost m@@ illions of ac@@ res of co@@ a@@ st@@ al man@@ gro@@ ves over the last 30 or 40 years .
"That r@@ ate of de@@ struc@@ tion has s@@ lo@@ wed , but we &apos;re still in a maj@@ or man@@ gro@@ ve de@@ fic@@ it ."
"The other thing that &apos;s going on here is a ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on that the fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker Mar@@ k B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in called &quot; &quot; G@@ r@@ in@@ ding N@@ em@@ o . &quot; &quot; This ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on is very , very re@@ le@@ v@@ ant to anything that you &apos;ve ever seen on a t@@ ro@@ pi@@ cal ree@@ f ."
"Because what &apos;s going on right now , we have sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p dra@@ g@@ g@@ ers dra@@ g@@ ging for sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , ca@@ t@@ ching a huge amount of b@@ y@@ ca@@ t@@ ch , that b@@ y@@ ca@@ t@@ ch in turn gets ground up and turned into sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p food ."
"And sometimes , many of these v@@ es@@ sel@@ s — man@@ ned by s@@ la@@ ves — are ca@@ t@@ ching these so@@ -@@ called &quot; &quot; tra@@ sh fish , &quot; &quot; fish that we would love to see on a ree@@ f , gr@@ in@@ ding them up and tur@@ ning them into sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p fe@@ ed — an ec@@ os@@ y@@ ste@@ m liter@@ ally e@@ ating itself and sp@@ it@@ ting out sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p ."
"The next most con@@ su@@ med se@@ af@@ ood in America , and also throu@@ gh@@ out the W@@ est , is tun@@ a ."
So tun@@ a is this ul@@ tim@@ ate global fish .
These huge man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment are@@ as have to be ob@@ ser@@ ved in order for tun@@ a to be well man@@ ag@@ ed .
"O@@ ur own man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment are@@ a , called a Re@@ gi@@ onal F@@ i@@ sh@@ er@@ ies M@@ an@@ a@@ ge@@ ment O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ ization , is called I@@ C@@ C@@ A@@ T , the Inter@@ national C@@ om@@ mis@@ sion for the Con@@ serv@@ ation of A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic T@@ un@@ as ."
"O@@ f course we &apos;ve seen incredi@@ ble im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ment in I@@ C@@ C@@ A@@ T in the last few years , there is t@@ ot@@ al room for im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ment , but it re@@ ma@@ ins to be said that tun@@ a is a global fish , and to man@@ age it , we have to man@@ age the g@@ lo@@ be ."
"Well , we could also try to grow tun@@ a but tun@@ a is a spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ arly bad an@@ ima@@ l for a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture ."
M@@ any people don &apos;t know this but tun@@ a are war@@ m@@ -@@ bloo@@ ded .
"They can he@@ at their bo@@ dies 20 de@@ gre@@ es ab@@ o@@ ve am@@ bi@@ ent te@@ m@@ per@@ ature , they can s@@ wi@@ m at over 40 mil@@ es an h@@ our ."
"So that pretty much e@@ li@@ min@@ ates all the adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ges of far@@ m@@ ing a fish , right ?"
"A far@@ med fish is — or a fish is col@@ d-@@ bloo@@ ded , it doesn &apos;t move too much ."
That &apos;s a great thing for gro@@ wing prot@@ e@@ in .
The next cre@@ ature — most con@@ su@@ med se@@ af@@ ood in America and throu@@ gh@@ out the W@@ est — is s@@ al@@ m@@ on .
"Now s@@ al@@ m@@ on got its pl@@ under@@ ing , too , but it didn &apos;t really nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly happen through fi@@ shing ."
This is my home state of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut .
Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut used to be home to a lot of wi@@ ld s@@ al@@ m@@ on .
"But if you look at this ma@@ p of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut , every do@@ t on that ma@@ p is a d@@ am ."
"There are over 3@@ ,000 da@@ ms in the state of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut ."
"I often say this is why people in Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut are so up@@ ti@@ ght — ( Laughter ) If somebody could just un@@ blo@@ ck Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut &apos;s ch@@ i , I feel that we could have an in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely better world ."
"But I made this particular com@@ ment at a con@@ ven@@ tion once of national par@@ ks off@@ ic@@ ers , and this guy from Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ a si@@ d@@ led up to me , he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you ou@@ gh@@ t@@ n &apos;t be so hard on your Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut , cause we here in Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ a , we got 3@@ 5@@ ,000 da@@ ms . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s a national ep@@ ide@@ mic , it &apos;s an inter@@ national ep@@ ide@@ mic ."
"And there are da@@ ms every@@ where , and these are pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly the things that stop wi@@ ld s@@ al@@ m@@ on from re@@ ach@@ ing their sp@@ aw@@ ning gr@@ ounds ."
Th@@ ose p@@ el@@ le@@ ts are in turn re@@ duc@@ ed fish .
"So the ac@@ tual — what &apos;s called the F@@ I@@ F@@ O , the fish in and the fish out — kind of hard to say ."
"But in any case , cre@@ d@@ it to the indu@@ stry , it has lo@@ wer@@ ed the amount of fish per p@@ ound of s@@ al@@ m@@ on ."
P@@ ro@@ b@@ le@@ m is we &apos;ve also g@@ one cra@@ z@@ y with the amount of s@@ al@@ m@@ on that we &apos;re produc@@ ing .
A@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture is the fa@@ ste@@ st gro@@ wing food system on the planet .
It &apos;s gro@@ wing at something like seven percent per year .
"And so even though we &apos;re doing less per fish to bring it to the market , we &apos;re still kill@@ ing a lot of these little fish ."
"And it &apos;s not just fish that we &apos;re fe@@ e@@ ding fish to , we &apos;re also fe@@ e@@ ding fish to ch@@ ic@@ k@@ ens and pi@@ gs ."
"So we &apos;ve got ch@@ ic@@ k@@ ens and they &apos;re e@@ ating fish , but we@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , we also have fish that are e@@ ating ch@@ ic@@ k@@ ens ."
"Because the b@@ y@@ produc@@ ts of ch@@ ic@@ k@@ ens — f@@ ea@@ thers , bloo@@ d , b@@ one — get ground up and f@@ ed to fish ."
What you &apos;re talking about is something between 20 and 30 million me@@ tri@@ c t@@ ons of wi@@ ld cre@@ at@@ u@@ res that are taken from the oce@@ an and used and ground up .
"That &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a third of a China , or of an entire United States of humans that &apos;s taken out of the se@@ a each and every year ."
The last of the four is a kind of am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous thing .
"It &apos;s what the indu@@ stry call@@ s &quot; &quot; wh@@ it@@ e@@ fish . &quot; &quot; There are many fish that get cy@@ cl@@ ed into this wh@@ it@@ e@@ fish thing but the way to kind of tell the story , I think , is through that cla@@ ssi@@ c piece of American cul@@ in@@ ary inno@@ v@@ ation , the F@@ i@@ le@@ t-@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ ish s@@ and@@ w@@ ich ."
So the F@@ i@@ le@@ t-@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ ish s@@ and@@ w@@ ich actually started as h@@ ali@@ but .
"And it started because a lo@@ cal f@@ ran@@ ch@@ ise o@@ w@@ ner found that when he ser@@ ved his M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s on F@@ ri@@ day , no@@ body came ."
"Because it was a C@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c community , they needed fish ."
"So he went to R@@ ay K@@ ro@@ c and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to bring you a fish s@@ and@@ w@@ ich , going to be made out of h@@ ali@@ but . &quot;"
"@@ R@@ ay K@@ ro@@ c said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to work ."
"I want to do a H@@ ul@@ a B@@ ur@@ ger , and there &apos;s going to be a sli@@ ce of p@@ in@@ e@@ app@@ le on a bu@@ n ."
"But let &apos;s do this , let &apos;s have a be@@ t ."
"Wh@@ os@@ ever s@@ and@@ w@@ ich sel@@ ls more , that will be the win@@ ning s@@ and@@ w@@ ich . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s kind of sa@@ d for the oce@@ an that the H@@ ul@@ a B@@ ur@@ ger didn &apos;t w@@ in ."
So he made his h@@ ali@@ but s@@ and@@ w@@ ich .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately though , the s@@ and@@ w@@ ich came in at 30 c@@ ents ."
"@@ R@@ ay wanted the s@@ and@@ w@@ ich to come in at 25 c@@ ents , so he turned to A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic co@@ d ."
We all know what happened to A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic co@@ d in New Eng@@ land .
"So now the F@@ i@@ le@@ t-@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ ish s@@ and@@ w@@ ich is made out of A@@ la@@ sk@@ a pol@@ lo@@ ck , it &apos;s the lar@@ gest f@@ in fish fi@@ sh@@ ery in the United States , 2 to 3 billion p@@ ounds of fish taken out of the se@@ a every single year ."
"If we go through the pol@@ lo@@ ck , the next cho@@ ice is probably going to be ti@@ l@@ ap@@ ia ."
T@@ il@@ ap@@ ia is one of those fish no@@ body ever heard of 20 years ago .
"It &apos;s actually a very eff@@ ici@@ ent conver@@ ter of pl@@ ant prot@@ e@@ in into an@@ ima@@ l prot@@ e@@ in , and it &apos;s been a go@@ d@@ s@@ end to the third world ."
"It &apos;s actually a tre@@ m@@ end@@ ously su@@ sta@@ in@@ able solu@@ tion , it goes from an e@@ g@@ g to an ad@@ ult in n@@ ine months ."
It really doesn &apos;t have what &apos;s called an o@@ i@@ ly fish pro@@ fi@@ le .
It doesn &apos;t have the E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s that we all think are going to make us live fore@@ ver .
So what do we do ?
"I mean , first of all , what about this poor fish , the clu@@ pe@@ i@@ ds ?"
The fish that re@@ pres@@ ent a huge part of that 20 to 30 million me@@ tri@@ c t@@ ons .
C@@ ould we e@@ at them direc@@ tly instead of fe@@ e@@ ding them to s@@ al@@ m@@ on ?
"They are tre@@ m@@ end@@ ously fu@@ el eff@@ ici@@ ent to bring to market , a f@@ r@@ action of the fu@@ el cost of say , sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , and at the very top of the car@@ b@@ on eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y scale ."
"They also are ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 ri@@ ch , a great source for E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A ."
So that is a pot@@ ential .
"And if we were to go down that rou@@ te what I would say is , instead of pa@@ ying a few b@@ uc@@ ks a p@@ ound — or a few b@@ uc@@ ks a ton , really — and making it into a@@ qu@@ a@@ fe@@ ed , could we hal@@ ve the ca@@ t@@ ch and d@@ ou@@ ble the pri@@ ce for the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men and make that our way of tre@@ ating these particular fish ?"
"O@@ ther pos@@ si@@ bility though , which is much more interesting , is looking at bi@@ val@@ ves , partic@@ ul@@ arly m@@ us@@ sel@@ s ."
"Now , m@@ us@@ sel@@ s are very high in E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A , they &apos;re si@@ mil@@ ar to can@@ ned tun@@ a ."
They &apos;re also extre@@ me@@ ly fu@@ el eff@@ ici@@ ent .
T@@ o bring a p@@ ound of m@@ us@@ sel@@ s to market is about a th@@ ir@@ ti@@ e@@ th of the car@@ b@@ on as requ@@ i@@ red to bring be@@ e@@ f to market .
"They requ@@ ire no for@@ age fish , they actually get their ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s by fil@@ ter@@ ing the water of micro@@ al@@ ga@@ e ."
"In fact , that &apos;s where ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s come from , they don &apos;t come from fish ."
"M@@ ic@@ ro@@ al@@ ga@@ e make the ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s , they &apos;re only bio@@ con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated in fish ."
M@@ us@@ sel@@ s and other bi@@ val@@ ves do tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous amoun@@ ts of water fil@@ tra@@ tion .
A single m@@ us@@ se@@ l can fil@@ ter do@@ z@@ ens of g@@ all@@ ons every single day .
And this is incredi@@ bly important when we look at the world .
"@@ R@@ ight now , n@@ it@@ ri@@ fi@@ cation , over@@ use of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ ates in our wat@@ er@@ ways are ca@@ using tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous al@@ g@@ al blo@@ om@@ s ."
"O@@ ver 4@@ 00 new de@@ ad z@@ ones have been created in the last 20 years , tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous sources of mar@@ ine life de@@ ath ."
We also could look at not a fish at all .
We could look at a ve@@ ge@@ table .
"We could look at se@@ a@@ we@@ ed , the k@@ el@@ ps , all these different vari@@ e@@ ties of things that can be high in ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s , can be high in prot@@ e@@ ins , tre@@ m@@ end@@ ously good things ."
They fil@@ ter the water just like m@@ us@@ sel@@ s do .
"And we@@ ir@@ d@@ ly enough , it turns out that you can actually fe@@ ed this to co@@ ws ."
"Now , I &apos;m not a big f@@ an of ca@@ t@@ tle ."
"But if you wanted to keep gro@@ wing ca@@ t@@ tle in a time and place where water re@@ sources are lim@@ ited , you &apos;re gro@@ wing se@@ a@@ we@@ ed in the water , you don &apos;t have to water it — maj@@ or consi@@ der@@ ation ."
And the last fish is a question mar@@ k .
We have the ability to create a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ tu@@ red fish that cre@@ ates a net ga@@ in of mar@@ ine prot@@ e@@ in for us .
"This cre@@ ature would have to be ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ari@@ an , it would have to be fa@@ st gro@@ wing , it would have to be ad@@ ap@@ table to a chan@@ ging climate and it would have to have that o@@ i@@ ly fish pro@@ fi@@ le , that E@@ P@@ A , D@@ H@@ A , ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty ac@@ id pro@@ fi@@ le that we &apos;re looking for ."
This ex@@ i@@ sts kind of on p@@ aper .
I have been re@@ por@@ ting on these sub@@ jects for 15 years .
"E@@ very time I do a new story , somebody t@@ ells me , &quot; &quot; We can do all that . We can do it . We &apos;ve fi@@ gu@@ red it all out ."
We can pro@@ duce a fish that &apos;s a net ga@@ in of mar@@ ine prot@@ e@@ in and has ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s . &quot; &quot; G@@ re@@ at .
It doesn &apos;t see@@ m to be getting sc@@ al@@ ed up .
It is time to scale this up .
"If we do , 30 million me@@ tri@@ c t@@ ons of se@@ af@@ ood , a third of the world ca@@ t@@ ch , sta@@ ys in the water ."
So I gu@@ ess what I &apos;m saying is this is what we &apos;ve been going with .
We t@@ end to go with our appe@@ ti@@ t@@ es rather than our min@@ ds .
"But if we went with this , or some con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation of it , we might have a little more of this ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I ess@@ enti@@ ally became an inf@@ ant in a woman &apos;s body .
"If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvi@@ ous that the two he@@ mi@@ sp@@ her@@ es are completely se@@ par@@ ate from one another ."
E@@ x@@ c@@ use me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a jo@@ y .
"I@@ n@@ formation , in the form of energy , st@@ rea@@ ms in si@@ mul@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously through all of our sen@@ s@@ ory systems and then it exp@@ lo@@ des into this en@@ or@@ mous col@@ la@@ ge of what this pres@@ ent moment looks like , what this pres@@ ent moment sm@@ ells like and ta@@ st@@ es like , what it fe@@ els like and what it s@@ ounds like ."
I am an ener@@ g@@ y-@@ being connec@@ ted to the energy all around me through the con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness of my right he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here .
"And in this moment we are per@@ f@@ ect , we are whole and we are beautiful ."
"M@@ y left he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here , our left he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here , is a very different place ."
O@@ ur left he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here thin@@ ks l@@ in@@ early and me@@ th@@ o@@ dic@@ ally .
And our left he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here thin@@ ks in language .
And all I could de@@ t@@ ect was this energy — energy .
"And I &apos;m as@@ king myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?"
And I felt li@@ gh@@ ter in my body .
