"When I was 11 , I remember w@@ aking up one mor@@ ning to the sound of j@@ oy in my house ."
"My father was lis@@ ten@@ ing to B@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws on his small , gra@@ y ra@@ dio ."
"There was a big s@@ mil@@ e on his face which was un@@ usu@@ al then , because the news mo@@ st@@ ly de@@ pres@@ sed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ ban are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ ban took over Af@@ gh@@ anis@@ tan and made it il@@ leg@@ al for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I dre@@ s@@ sed as a bo@@ y to es@@ cor@@ t my ol@@ der sis@@ ter , who was no longer allo@@ wed to be outside alone , to a se@@ cre@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be educ@@ ated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different ro@@ u@@ te so that no one would su@@ spe@@ ct where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our books in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would see@@ m we were just out sho@@ p@@ ping .
"The school was in a house , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small living room ."
It was co@@ z@@ y in win@@ ter but extre@@ me@@ ly ho@@ t in sum@@ mer .
"We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the teach@@ er , the students and our parents ."
"F@@ ro@@ m time to time , the school would su@@ d@@ den@@ ly be can@@ c@@ ele@@ d for a week because T@@ ali@@ ban were su@@ spi@@ ci@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being follo@@ wed ?
D@@ o they know where we live ?
"We were s@@ car@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ z@@ ed and d@@ augh@@ ters were tre@@ asu@@ red .
My grand@@ father was an extra@@ ordin@@ ary man for his time .
"A to@@ tal ma@@ ver@@ ic@@ k from a re@@ m@@ ote pro@@ vin@@ ce of Af@@ gh@@ anis@@ tan , he in@@ sis@@ ted that his d@@ aughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was dis@@ ow@@ ned by his father ."
But my educ@@ ated mother became a teach@@ er .
There she is .
"She re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for gir@@ ls and women in our n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to rec@@ ei@@ ve an education .
"There was no question that his children would rec@@ ei@@ ve an education , inclu@@ ding his d@@ augh@@ ters , de@@ sp@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ ban , de@@ sp@@ ite the ris@@ ks ."
"To him , there was gre@@ ater ris@@ k in not educ@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ u@@ ring T@@ ali@@ ban years , I remember there were times I would get so f@@ rus@@ tra@@ ted by our life and always being s@@ car@@ ed and not seeing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ is@@ ten , my d@@ aughter , you can lo@@ se everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be sto@@ le@@ n . You can be for@@ ced to leave your home during a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to se@@ ll our bloo@@ d to p@@ ay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to contin@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in a country that has been de@@ st@@ roy@@ ed by dec@@ ades of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ y@@ ond high school , and had my family not been so comm@@ it@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"In@@ stead , I stand here a pro@@ u@@ d gra@@ du@@ ate of M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ bu@@ ry C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ en I re@@ turned to Af@@ gh@@ anis@@ tan , my grand@@ father , the one ex@@ i@@ led from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his d@@ augh@@ ters , was a@@ mon@@ g the first to con@@ gra@@ tu@@ late me ."
"He not only b@@ rag@@ s about my colle@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l ."
( Applause ) My family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ am@@ s even big@@ ger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n to educ@@ ate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for gir@@ ls in Af@@ gh@@ anis@@ tan , a country where it &apos;s still ris@@ k@@ y for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
The exci@@ ting thing is that I see students at my school with am@@ bi@@ tion gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing at opportunity .
"And I see their parents and their f@@ ath@@ ers who , like my own , ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate for them , de@@ sp@@ ite and even in the face of d@@ au@@ n@@ ting op@@ posi@@ tion ."
"L@@ ike A@@ h@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ med is the father of one of my students ."
"L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his d@@ aughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their v@@ ill@@ age , and they liter@@ ally mis@@ sed being kil@@ led by a ro@@ ad@@ side b@@ om@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ riv@@ ed home , the phone ran@@ g , a voice war@@ ning him that if he s@@ ent his d@@ aughter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my d@@ aughter &apos;s future because of your old and bac@@ k@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about Af@@ gh@@ anis@@ tan , and this is something that is often dis@@ mis@@ sed in the W@@ est , that behind most of us who suc@@ ce@@ ed is a father who reco@@ gn@@ iz@@ es the val@@ ue in his d@@ aughter and who se@@ es that her suc@@ cess is his suc@@ cess ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mo@@ th@@ ers ar@@ en &apos;t key in our suc@@ cess .
"In fact , they &apos;re often the in@@ iti@@ al and con@@ vin@@ cing ne@@ go@@ ti@@ a@@ tors of a b@@ right future for their d@@ augh@@ ters , but in the con@@ text of a society like in Af@@ gh@@ anis@@ tan , we must have the sup@@ port of men ."
"U@@ n@@ der the T@@ ali@@ ban , gir@@ ls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hundre@@ ds — remember , it was il@@ leg@@ al ."
"But today , more than three million gir@@ ls are in school in Af@@ gh@@ anis@@ tan ."
( Applause ) Af@@ gh@@ anis@@ tan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americ@@ ans see the f@@ rag@@ ility in changes .
I fe@@ ar that these changes will not last much be@@ y@@ ond the U.S. tro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in Af@@ gh@@ anis@@ tan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate for them , who en@@ cou@@ rag@@ e them , I see a pro@@ mis@@ ing future and las@@ ting change ."
"To me , Af@@ gh@@ anis@@ tan is a country of hope and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties , and every single day the gir@@ ls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"L@@ ike me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
And you &apos;ll now see the y@@ ol@@ k and the wh@@ ite have se@@ para@@ ted .
And sli@@ gh@@ tly more complex things appe@@ ar .
That &apos;s tw@@ ice as long as humans have been on this planet .
"And de@@ ep ben@@ e@@ ath those oc@@ e@@ ans , at cra@@ cks in the Earth &apos;s c@@ r@@ ust , you &apos;ve got he@@ at se@@ ep@@ ing up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great di@@ versity of ele@@ ments ."
"But of course , life is more than just ex@@ oti@@ c che@@ mis@@ try ."
H@@ u@@ man be@@ ings start pu@@ tting each other into bo@@ x@@ es the second that they see each other — I@@ s that person dang@@ er@@ ous ? A@@ re they at@@ tra@@ ctive ?
A@@ re they a poten@@ tial mate ? A@@ re they a poten@@ tial net@@ working opportunity ?
We do this little inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation when we me@@ et people to make a mental re@@ su@@ me for them .
What &apos;s your name ? Wh@@ ere are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Th@@ en we get more person@@ al with it .
H@@ ave you ever had any dis@@ eas@@ es ?
H@@ ave you ever been di@@ v@@ or@@ ced ?
D@@ o@@ es your bre@@ ath s@@ me@@ ll bad while you &apos;re ans@@ wer@@ ing my inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation right now ?
What are you into ? Wh@@ o are you into ?
What gen@@ der do you like to s@@ le@@ ep with ?
I get it .
We are neuro@@ log@@ ically har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to see@@ k out people like ourselves .
We start for@@ ming cli@@ qu@@ es as so@@ on as we &apos;re old enough to know what ac@@ cep@@ tance feel@@ s like .
"We b@@ ond together based on anything that we can — music pre@@ fer@@ ence , ra@@ ce , gen@@ der , the blo@@ ck that we gre@@ w up on ."
We see@@ k out environ@@ ments that re@@ in@@ for@@ ce our person@@ al cho@@ ices .
"S@@ ome@@ times , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s open@@ ing a tin@@ y little box and as@@ king you to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze yourself inside of it ."
"Because the ca@@ te@@ gor@@ ies , I &apos;ve found , are too li@@ mi@@ ting ."
The bo@@ x@@ es are too nar@@ row .
And this can get really dang@@ er@@ ous .
"So here &apos;s a dis@@ cl@@ ai@@ mer about me , though , before we get too de@@ ep into this ."
I gre@@ w up in a very sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed environment .
"I was ra@@ is@@ ed in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn Man@@ ha@@ t@@ tan in the early 19@@ 8@@ 0s , two blo@@ cks from the ep@@ ic@@ en@@ ter of p@@ un@@ k music ."
I was shi@@ el@@ ded from the pa@@ ins of big@@ ot@@ ry and the social re@@ stri@@ ctions of a reli@@ gi@@ ous@@ ly@@ -@@ based up@@ b@@ rin@@ ging .
"Wh@@ ere I come from , if you wer@@ en &apos;t a dra@@ g qu@@ e@@ en or a ra@@ di@@ cal thin@@ ker or a perfor@@ man@@ ce arti@@ st of some kind , you were the w@@ ei@@ r@@ do ."
"( Laughter ) It was an un@@ orth@@ o@@ do@@ x up@@ b@@ rin@@ ging , but as a ki@@ d on the stre@@ ets of New York , you learn how to tr@@ ust your own in@@ s@@ tin@@ cts , you learn how to go with your own ideas ."
"So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a bo@@ y ."
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play bas@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ all with them .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let gir@@ ls play .
"So I went home , and I s@@ ha@@ ved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a bo@@ y . &quot; &quot; I mean , who kno@@ ws , right ?"
"When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that ."
"I didn &apos;t want any@@ one to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t ."
I kep@@ t up the char@@ ad@@ e for eight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was pla@@ ying a ki@@ d na@@ med W@@ al@@ ter in a movi@@ e called &quot; &quot; J@@ u@@ li@@ an P@@ o . &quot; &quot; I was a little stre@@ et to@@ ugh that follo@@ wed Chris@@ ti@@ an S@@ later around and b@@ ad@@ ger@@ ed him .
"S@@ e@@ e , I was also a child ac@@ tor , which d@@ ou@@ b@@ led up the la@@ y@@ ers of the perfor@@ man@@ ce of my identi@@ ty , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really pla@@ ying a bo@@ y ."
"In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teach@@ ers at school , not my friends , not the direc@@ tors that I worked with ."
K@@ i@@ ds would often come up to me in clas@@ s and gra@@ b me by the thro@@ at to che@@ ck for an A@@ da@@ m &apos;s ap@@ ple or gra@@ b my cro@@ t@@ ch to che@@ ck what I was working with .
"When I would go to the ba@@ thro@@ om , I would turn my sho@@ es around in the st@@ alls so that it looked like I was pe@@ e@@ ing standing up ."
A@@ t s@@ le@@ epo@@ ver@@ s I would have pan@@ ic atta@@ cks trying to bre@@ ak it to gir@@ ls that they didn &apos;t want to k@@ is@@ s me without ou@@ ting myself .
It &apos;s wor@@ th men@@ tion@@ ing though that I didn &apos;t ha@@ te my body or my gen@@ it@@ alia .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was perfor@@ ming this el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ed as trans@@ gen@@ der .
"If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therap@@ y , they probably would have diagno@@ sed me as something like gen@@ der dy@@ s@@ mor@@ ph@@ ic and put me on hor@@ mon@@ es to sta@@ ve off pu@@ ber@@ ty ."
"But in my particular case , I just wo@@ ke up one day when I was 1@@ 4 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again ."
"P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty had h@@ it , and I had no idea what being a girl me@@ ant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was ."
"When a ki@@ d beha@@ ves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?"
No one is exactly sho@@ c@@ ked .
( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to defin@@ e myself by my parents .
"When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fal@@ le@@ n in love , it was the last thing on either of our min@@ ds to dis@@ cus@@ s what the con@@ sequ@@ ences were of the fact that my first love was a girl ."
"Th@@ ree years later , when I f@@ ell in love with a man , n@@ either of my parents bat@@ ted an ey@@ el@@ as@@ h either ."
"S@@ e@@ e , it &apos;s one of the great b@@ le@@ ss@@ ings of my very un@@ orth@@ o@@ do@@ x chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to defin@@ e myself as any one thing at any point ."
"I was just allo@@ wed to be me , growing and chan@@ ging in every moment ."
"So four , almost five years ago , Pro@@ posi@@ tion 8 , the great mar@@ ri@@ age equ@@ ality de@@ b@@ ate , was ra@@ is@@ ing a lot of d@@ ust around this country ."
"And at the time , getting mar@@ ried wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about ."
"But I was struc@@ k by the fact that America , a country with such a tar@@ nis@@ hed civi@@ l ri@@ ghts recor@@ d , could be re@@ pe@@ ating its mis@@ takes so b@@ la@@ tan@@ tly ."
"And I remember wat@@ ching the dis@@ cus@@ sion on tele@@ vision and thinking how interesting it was that the se@@ par@@ ation of ch@@ ur@@ ch and state was es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally dra@@ wing ge@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ical b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies thro@@ ugh@@ out this country , between places where people beli@@ ev@@ ed in it and places where people didn &apos;t ."
"And then , that this dis@@ cus@@ sion was dra@@ wing ge@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ical b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies around me ."
"If this was a war with two dis@@ par@@ ate si@@ des , I , by de@@ f@@ au@@ l@@ t , f@@ ell on team g@@ ay , because I cer@@ tain@@ ly wasn &apos;t 100 percent stra@@ i@@ ght ."
"A@@ t the time I was just beginning to e@@ mer@@ ge from this eigh@@ t-@@ year person@@ al identi@@ ty c@@ risis z@@ ig@@ z@@ a@@ g that saw me go from being a bo@@ y to being this aw@@ k@@ ward girl that looked like a bo@@ y in girl &apos;s clo@@ thes to the op@@ pos@@ ite extre@@ me of this su@@ per sk@@ im@@ py , over@@ -@@ com@@ pen@@ sa@@ ting , b@@ oy@@ -@@ chas@@ ing gir@@ ly@@ -@@ girl to finally just a h@@ es@@ it@@ ant expl@@ or@@ ation of what I actually was , a tom@@ b@@ oy@@ ish girl who lik@@ ed both b@@ oys and gir@@ ls depen@@ ding on the person ."
"I had spent a year photograp@@ hing this new gener@@ ation of gir@@ ls , much like myself , who f@@ ell kind of be@@ twe@@ en@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ lin@@ es — gir@@ ls who s@@ kate@@ bo@@ ar@@ ded but did it in l@@ ac@@ y under@@ we@@ ar , gir@@ ls who had b@@ oys &apos; h@@ air@@ cu@@ ts but wor@@ e gir@@ ly n@@ ai@@ l pol@@ ish , gir@@ ls who had ey@@ es@@ ha@@ do@@ w to mat@@ ch their s@@ c@@ rap@@ ed k@@ nees , gir@@ ls who lik@@ ed gir@@ ls and b@@ oys who all lik@@ ed b@@ oys and gir@@ ls who all ha@@ ted being bo@@ x@@ ed in to anything ."
"I lo@@ ved these people , and I ad@@ mi@@ red their fre@@ e@@ dom , but I wat@@ ched as the world outside of our u@@ to@@ pi@@ an bu@@ b@@ ble ex@@ plo@@ ded into these rag@@ ing de@@ b@@ ates where p@@ un@@ d@@ its started lik@@ en@@ ing our love to be@@ sti@@ ality on national tele@@ vision ."
"And this powerful a@@ war@@ en@@ ess ro@@ l@@ led in over me that I was a min@@ or@@ ity , and in my own home country , based on one fac@@ et of my charac@@ ter ."
I was leg@@ ally and in@@ dis@@ pu@@ ta@@ bly a secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s ci@@ tiz@@ en .
I was not an ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ t .
I wa@@ ve no fl@@ ag@@ s in my own life .
But I was pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed by this question : How could any@@ one v@@ ote to stri@@ p the ri@@ ghts of the vas@@ t vari@@ e@@ ty of people that I knew based on one ele@@ ment of their charac@@ ter ?
How could they say that we as a group were not de@@ ser@@ ving of equ@@ al ri@@ ghts as somebody else ?
W@@ ere we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even consci@@ ously met a v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of their dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation ?
Di@@ d they know who they were vo@@ ting against and what the imp@@ act was ?
"And then it oc@@ cur@@ red to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were cas@@ ting into secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s ci@@ tiz@@ en@@ ship it might make it har@@ der for them to do ."
It might give them p@@ ause .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same din@@ ner par@@ ty , so I figu@@ red out a way where I could in@@ tro@@ duce them to each other photograp@@ h@@ ically without any arti@@ f@@ ice , without any li@@ gh@@ ting , or without any man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation of any kind on my part ."
Because in a photograp@@ h you can exam@@ ine a lion &apos;s wh@@ is@@ k@@ ers without the fe@@ ar of him ri@@ p@@ ping your face off .
"For me , photograp@@ h@@ y is not just about ex@@ pos@@ ing film , it &apos;s about ex@@ pos@@ ing the vie@@ wer to something new , a place they ha@@ ven &apos;t gone before , but most impor@@ tan@@ tly , to people that they might be af@@ ra@@ id of ."
"L@@ i@@ fe mag@@ az@@ ine in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed gener@@ ations of people to dis@@ tant , far@@ -@@ off cul@@ tures they never knew exis@@ ted through pic@@ tures ."
"So I decided to make a ser@@ ies of very simple por@@ tra@@ its , mu@@ g@@ sh@@ ots if you will ."
"And I basically decided to photograp@@ h any@@ one in this country that was not 100 percent stra@@ i@@ ght , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a li@@ mit@@ less number of people ."
"( Laughter ) So this was a very large under@@ taking , and to do it we needed some help ."
"So I ran out in the fre@@ ez@@ ing col@@ d , and I photograp@@ hed every single person that I knew that I could get to in F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary of about two years ago ."
"And I took those photograp@@ h@@ s , and I went to the H@@ R@@ C and I asked them for some help ."
And they fun@@ ded two we@@ eks of sho@@ o@@ ting in New York .
And then we made this .
"( Music ) V@@ ide@@ o : I &apos;m i@@ O T@@ il@@ le@@ t@@ t W@@ right , and I &apos;m an arti@@ st born and ra@@ is@@ ed in New York C@@ ity . ( Music )"
S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is a photograp@@ hi@@ c recor@@ d of L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q America today .
My ai@@ m is to take a simple por@@ tra@@ it of any@@ one who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent stra@@ i@@ ght or feel@@ s like they f@@ all in the L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q spe@@ c@@ tr@@ um in any way .
My go@@ al is to show the human@@ ity that exis@@ ts in every one of us through the sim@@ pli@@ city of a face .
( Music ) &quot; We hold these tru@@ ths to be self-@@ evi@@ dent that all men are created equ@@ al . &quot;
It &apos;s w@@ rit@@ ten in the De@@ c@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ depen@@ dence .
We are fa@@ il@@ ing as a n@@ ation to up@@ hold the mor@@ als upo@@ n which we were f@@ oun@@ ded .
There is no equ@@ ality in the United States .

&#91; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o is respon@@ si@@ ble for equ@@ ality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundre@@ ds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all respon@@ si@@ ble for equ@@ ality . &quot;
So far we &apos;ve sho@@ t 3@@ 00 fac@@ es in New York C@@ ity .
And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the gener@@ ous sup@@ port of the H@@ u@@ man Ri@@ ghts C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n .
I want to take the project across the country .
"I want to vis@@ it 25 American cities , and I want to sho@@ ot 4@@ ,000 or 5@@ ,000 people ."
This is my con@@ tribu@@ tion to the civi@@ l ri@@ ghts fi@@ ght of my gener@@ ation .
I challenge you to look into the fac@@ es of these people and tell them that they de@@ ser@@ ve less than any other human being .
"( Music ) &#91; &quot; &quot; S@@ el@@ f evi@@ dent tru@@ ths &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; 4@@ ,000 fac@@ es across America &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Music ) ( Applause ) i@@ O T@@ il@@ le@@ t@@ t W@@ right : A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely nothing could have pre@@ par@@ ed us for what happened after that ."
"A@@ l@@ most 8@@ 5@@ ,000 people wat@@ ched that video , and then they started ema@@ il@@ ing us from all over the country , as@@ king us to come to their to@@ w@@ ns and help them to show their fac@@ es ."
And a lot more people wanted to show their fac@@ es than I had anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted .
"So I changed my im@@ me@@ dia@@ te go@@ al to 10@@ ,000 fac@@ es ."
"That video was made in the sp@@ ring of 20@@ 11 , and as of today I have tra@@ v@@ ele@@ d to almost 20 cities and photograp@@ hed almost 2@@ ,000 people ."
"I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minu@@ te of just qui@@ et and have you just look at these fac@@ es because there is nothing that I can say that will ad@@ d to them ."
"Because if a picture is wor@@ th a thous@@ and words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vo@@ c@@ ab@@ u@@ lar@@ y ."
"So after tra@@ vel@@ ing and talking to people in places like O@@ k@@ la@@ h@@ oma or sm@@ all@@ -@@ to@@ wn T@@ ex@@ as , we found evi@@ dence that the in@@ iti@@ al pre@@ mis@@ e was de@@ ad on ."
V@@ is@@ i@@ bility really is key .
F@@ a@@ mi@@ li@@ ar@@ ity really is the ga@@ te@@ way dru@@ g to em@@ path@@ y .
"O@@ n@@ ce an issu@@ e po@@ ps up in your own bac@@ ky@@ ard or a@@ mon@@ g@@ st your own family , you &apos;re far more lik@@ ely to expl@@ ore sym@@ path@@ y for it or expl@@ ore a new per@@ spe@@ ctive on it ."
"O@@ f course , in my tra@@ vel@@ s I met people who leg@@ ally di@@ v@@ or@@ ced their children for being other than stra@@ i@@ ght , but I also met people who were S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ tists who s@@ wit@@ ched ch@@ u@@ rch@@ es because their child was a le@@ s@@ bi@@ an ."
S@@ par@@ king em@@ path@@ y had become the bac@@ k@@ b@@ one of S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths .
But here &apos;s what I was star@@ ting to learn that was really interesting : S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths doesn &apos;t er@@ ase the differ@@ ences between us .
"In fact , on the con@@ tr@@ ary , it high@@ li@@ ghts them ."
"It presen@@ ts , not just the comple@@ xi@@ ties found in a pro@@ ces@@ sion of different human be@@ ings , but the comple@@ xi@@ ties found within each individu@@ al person ."
"It wasn &apos;t that we had too many bo@@ x@@ es , it was that we had too few ."
"A@@ t some point I realized that my mis@@ sion to photograp@@ h &quot; &quot; ga@@ ys &quot; &quot; was in@@ her@@ ently f@@ la@@ wed , because there were a million different s@@ ha@@ des of g@@ ay ."
"@@ Here I was trying to help , and I had per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated the very thing I had spent my life trying to av@@ o@@ id — yet another box ."
A@@ t some point I ad@@ ded a question to the rele@@ ase form that asked people to qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent g@@ ay .
And I wat@@ ched so many exis@@ ten@@ tial c@@ ris@@ es un@@ f@@ old in front of me .
( Laughter ) Pe@@ ople didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presen@@ ted with the op@@ tion before .
C@@ an you qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y your open@@ ness ?
"O@@ n@@ ce they got over the sho@@ ck , though , by and large people op@@ ted for some@@ where between 70 to 9@@ 5 percent or the 3 to 20 percent mar@@ ks ."
"O@@ f course , there were lots of people who op@@ ted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much lar@@ ger pro@@ por@@ tion of people identi@@ fi@@ ed as something that was much more nu@@ an@@ ced ."
I found that most people f@@ all on a spe@@ c@@ tr@@ um of what I have come to re@@ fer to as &quot; &quot; Gre@@ y . &quot; &quot; Let me be cle@@ ar though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that pre@@ fer@@ ence doesn &apos;t exis@@ t .
"And I am not even going to ad@@ dre@@ ss the issu@@ e of choice ver@@ su@@ s bi@@ olog@@ ical im@@ per@@ a@@ tive , because if any of you happen to be of the beli@@ ef that sex@@ ual or@@ i@@ en@@ tation is a choice , I inv@@ ite you to go out and try to be gre@@ y ."
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human be@@ ings are not on@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al .
"The most important thing to take from the per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge system is this : If you have g@@ ay people over here and you have stra@@ i@@ ght people over here , and while we reco@@ gn@@ ize that most people identi@@ f@@ y as some@@ where clo@@ ser to one b@@ in@@ ary or another , there is this vas@@ t spe@@ c@@ tr@@ um of people that exis@@ t in between ."
And the reality that this presen@@ ts is a com@@ plic@@ ated one .
"Because , for example , if you pas@@ s a la@@ w that allo@@ ws a b@@ os@@ s to fi@@ re an em@@ ploy@@ e@@ e for ho@@ mo@@ sex@@ ual behavior , where exactly do you dra@@ w the line ?"
"I@@ s it over here , by the people who have had one or two he@@ tero@@ sex@@ ual experi@@ ences so far ?"
O@@ r is it over here by the people who have only had one or two ho@@ mo@@ sex@@ ual experi@@ ences th@@ us far ?
Wh@@ ere exactly does one become a secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s ci@@ tiz@@ en ?
A@@ no@@ ther interesting thing that I learned from my project and my tra@@ vel@@ s is just what a po@@ or b@@ in@@ ding ag@@ ent sex@@ ual or@@ i@@ en@@ tation is .
"A@@ f@@ ter tra@@ vel@@ ing so much and me@@ e@@ ting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many j@@ er@@ ks and s@@ we@@ e@@ the@@ ar@@ ts and De@@ mo@@ cra@@ ts and R@@ ep@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ans and j@@ oc@@ ks and qu@@ e@@ ens and every other pol@@ ar@@ ization you can possi@@ bly think of within the L@@ G@@ B@@ T community as there are within the human ra@@ ce ."
"A@@ side from the fact that we play with one leg@@ al hand ti@@ ed behind our bac@@ ks , and once you get past the shar@@ ed nar@@ ra@@ tive of pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce and str@@ ug@@ g@@ le , just being other than stra@@ i@@ ght doesn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly mean that we have anything in common ."
"So in the en@@ d@@ less pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of fac@@ es that S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is always be@@ coming , as it ho@@ pe@@ fully appe@@ ars across more and more pl@@ at@@ for@@ ms , b@@ us sh@@ el@@ ters , bil@@ l@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , F@@ ace@@ book pag@@ es , scre@@ en sa@@ ver@@ s , perhaps in wat@@ ching this pro@@ ces@@ sion of human@@ ity , something interesting and u@@ se@@ ful will beg@@ in to happen ."
"H@@ o@@ pe@@ fully these ca@@ te@@ gor@@ ies , these b@@ in@@ ar@@ ies , these over@@ -@@ sim@@ pli@@ fi@@ ed bo@@ x@@ es will beg@@ in to become u@@ se@@ less and they &apos;ll beg@@ in to f@@ all away ."
"Because really , they descri@@ be nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are ."
What we see are human be@@ ings in all their mul@@ ti@@ pli@@ city .
And seeing them makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their human@@ ity .
A@@ t the very least I hope it makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their human ri@@ ghts .
"So is it me particu@@ lar@@ ly that you would cho@@ ose to den@@ y the right to h@@ ous@@ ing , the right to a@@ do@@ pt children , the right to mar@@ ri@@ age , the fre@@ e@@ dom to sho@@ p here , live here , bu@@ y here ?"
"A@@ m I the one that you cho@@ ose to dis@@ own as your child or your bro@@ ther or your sis@@ ter or your mother or your father , your n@@ eigh@@ b@@ or , your cou@@ s@@ in , your un@@ cle , the pre@@ si@@ dent , your poli@@ ce woman or the fi@@ re@@ man ?"
It &apos;s too late .
Because I already am all of those things .
"We already are all of those things , and we always have been ."
"So ple@@ ase don &apos;t gre@@ et us as str@@ ang@@ ers , gre@@ et us as your fel@@ low human be@@ ings , peri@@ od ."

"M@@ any have been tri@@ c@@ ked by fal@@ se pro@@ mis@@ es of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re for@@ ced to work without p@@ ay under the thre@@ at of violence , and they cannot walk away ."
"T@@ o@@ day &apos;s s@@ la@@ very is about com@@ mer@@ ce , so the go@@ ods that en@@ s@@ la@@ ved people pro@@ duce have val@@ ue , but the people produc@@ ing them are dis@@ pos@@ able ."
"S@@ la@@ very exis@@ ts every@@ where , ne@@ ar@@ ly , in the world , and yet it is il@@ leg@@ al every@@ where in the world ."
"In India and N@@ ep@@ al , I was in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed to the bri@@ ck kil@@ ns ."
This str@@ an@@ ge and aw@@ es@@ ome si@@ ght was like wal@@ king into an@@ ci@@ ent E@@ gy@@ pt or D@@ an@@ te &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
"En@@ velo@@ ped in tem@@ per@@ a@@ tures of 1@@ 30 de@@ gre@@ es , men , women , children , entire fami@@ lies in fact , were clo@@ ak@@ ed in a he@@ av@@ y b@@ lan@@ ke@@ t of d@@ ust , while me@@ chan@@ ically sta@@ c@@ king bri@@ cks on their head , up to 1@@ 8 at a time , and car@@ r@@ ying them from the s@@ cor@@ ching kil@@ ns to tr@@ uc@@ ks hundre@@ ds of y@@ ar@@ ds away ."
"D@@ e@@ ad@@ en@@ ed by mon@@ o@@ ton@@ y and ex@@ h@@ au@@ s@@ tion , they work si@@ len@@ tly , doing this tas@@ k over and over for 1@@ 6 or 1@@ 7 hours a day ."
"There were no bre@@ ak@@ s for food , no water bre@@ ak@@ s , and the se@@ v@@ ere de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion made u@@ rin@@ ating pretty much in@@ con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al ."
So per@@ vas@@ i@@ ve was the he@@ at and the d@@ ust that my ca@@ mera became too ho@@ t to even to@@ uch and c@@ eas@@ ed working .
"E@@ very 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our c@@ ru@@ is@@ er to cle@@ an out my ge@@ ar and run it under an air condi@@ tion@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it , and as I s@@ at there , I thought , my ca@@ mera is getting far better tre@@ at@@ ment than these people ."
"B@@ ack in the kil@@ ns , I wanted to c@@ ry , but the ab@@ o@@ li@@ tion@@ ist next to me quickly gra@@ b@@ bed me and he said , &quot; &quot; L@@ isa , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very c@@ lear@@ ly expl@@ ain@@ ed to me that emo@@ tional dis@@ pla@@ ys are very dang@@ er@@ ous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them ."
I couldn &apos;t of@@ fer them any di@@ re@@ ct help .
"I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing ."
I wasn &apos;t a ci@@ tiz@@ en of that country .
I could get them in a wor@@ se sit@@ u@@ ation than they were already in .
"I &apos;d have to re@@ ly on F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves to work within the system for their li@@ ber@@ ation , and I tr@@ us@@ ted that they would ."
"As for me , I &apos;d have to wa@@ it until I got home to really feel my hear@@ t@@ bre@@ ak ."
"In the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as , I found children car@@ r@@ ying sto@@ ne for mil@@ es down m@@ oun@@ tain@@ ous ter@@ ra@@ in to tr@@ uc@@ ks w@@ ai@@ ting at ro@@ ad@@ s be@@ low ."
"The big sh@@ e@@ ets of s@@ late were he@@ a@@ vi@@ er than the children car@@ r@@ ying them , and the kids ho@@ is@@ ted them from their head@@ s using these h@@ and@@ made har@@ ne@@ s@@ ses of sti@@ cks and ro@@ pe and tor@@ n cl@@ ot@@ h ."
It &apos;s difficult to wit@@ ness something so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
"@@ How can we af@@ fect something so in@@ si@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ vas@@ i@@ ve ?"
"S@@ ome don &apos;t even know they &apos;re en@@ s@@ la@@ ved , people working 1@@ 6 , 1@@ 7 hours a day without any p@@ ay , because this has been the case all their lives ."
They have nothing to com@@ par@@ e it to .
"When these v@@ ill@@ ag@@ ers cl@@ ai@@ med their fre@@ e@@ dom , the s@@ la@@ ve@@ h@@ ol@@ ders bur@@ ned down all of their h@@ ou@@ ses ."
"I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so pe@@ tri@@ fi@@ ed , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the cen@@ ter r@@ alli@@ ed for them to per@@ se@@ v@@ ere , and ab@@ o@@ li@@ tion@@ is@@ ts on the ground hel@@ ped them get a qu@@ ar@@ ry le@@ ase of their own , so that now they do the same bac@@ k@@ -@@ bre@@ aking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get pai@@ d for it , and they do it in fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"S@@ e@@ x tra@@ f@@ fic@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word s@@ la@@ very , and because of this wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work sa@@ fe@@ ly within this particular indus@@ try ."
"In K@@ ath@@ man@@ d@@ u , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had pre@@ vi@@ ously been sex s@@ la@@ ves themselves ."
"They us@@ her@@ ed me down a nar@@ row set of sta@@ ir@@ s that led to this di@@ r@@ ty , di@@ m@@ ly flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent li@@ t bas@@ e@@ ment ."
"This wasn &apos;t a bro@@ the@@ l , per se ."
It was more like a re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant .
"C@@ ab@@ in re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts , as they &apos;re known in the tra@@ de , are ven@@ ues for for@@ ced pro@@ stitu@@ tion ."
"E@@ ach has small , p@@ riv@@ ate ro@@ om@@ s , where the s@@ la@@ ves , women , along with young gir@@ ls and b@@ oys , some as young as seven years old , are for@@ ced to en@@ ter@@ tain the cli@@ ents , en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ing them to bu@@ y more food and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ."
"E@@ ach cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le is dar@@ k and din@@ g@@ y , identi@@ fi@@ ed with a pain@@ ted number on the w@@ all , and parti@@ tion@@ ed by pl@@ y@@ wo@@ od and a cur@@ tain ."
The wor@@ k@@ ers here often en@@ du@@ re tra@@ gic sex@@ ual ab@@ use at the hands of their cus@@ to@@ mers .
"S@@ tan@@ ding in the ne@@ ar d@@ ark@@ ness , I remember feel@@ ing this quic@@ k , ho@@ t fe@@ ar , and in that in@@ st@@ ant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be trap@@ ped in that h@@ ell ."
I had only one way out : the sta@@ ir@@ s from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back do@@ ors .
There were no win@@ do@@ ws large enough to cli@@ m@@ b through .
"Th@@ ese people have no es@@ cap@@ e at all , and as we take in such a difficult sub@@ ject , it &apos;s important to n@@ ote that s@@ la@@ very , inclu@@ ding sex tra@@ f@@ fic@@ king , oc@@ cur@@ s in our own bac@@ ky@@ ard as well ."
"T@@ ens of hundre@@ ds of people are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in ag@@ ri@@ culture , in re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts , in do@@ me@@ sti@@ c serv@@ it@@ u@@ de , and the lis@@ t can go on ."
"@@ Re@@ cen@@ tly , the New York T@@ imes re@@ por@@ ted that between 10@@ 0,000 and 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 American children are sol@@ d into sex s@@ la@@ very every year ."
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The te@@ x@@ ti@@ le indus@@ try is another one we often think of when we hear about s@@ la@@ ve lab@@ or .
I visi@@ ted v@@ ill@@ ages in India where entire fami@@ lies were en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in the sil@@ k tra@@ de .
This is a family por@@ tra@@ it .
"The dy@@ ed black hands are the father , while the blu@@ e and red hands are his s@@ ons ."
"They mi@@ x dy@@ e in these big bar@@ re@@ ls , and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the sil@@ k into the li@@ qui@@ d up to their el@@ bo@@ ws , but the dy@@ e is to@@ x@@ ic ."
My inter@@ pre@@ ter told me their stories .
"&quot; &quot; We have no fre@@ e@@ dom , &quot; &quot; they said ."
"&quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get pai@@ d for our dy@@ e@@ ing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that more than 4@@ ,000 children are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved on L@@ ake V@@ ol@@ ta , the lar@@ gest man@@ -@@ made l@@ ake in the world ."
"When we first ar@@ riv@@ ed , I went to have a quic@@ k look ."
"I saw what see@@ med to be a family fis@@ hing on a bo@@ at , two ol@@ der bro@@ th@@ ers , some youn@@ ger kids , makes sense right ?"
W@@ rong . They were all en@@ s@@ la@@ ved .
"@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren are taken from their fami@@ lies and tra@@ f@@ fic@@ ked and van@@ is@@ hed , and they &apos;re for@@ ced to work en@@ d@@ less hours on these bo@@ a@@ ts on the l@@ ake , even though they do not know how to s@@ wi@@ m ."
This young child is eight years old .
"He was tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling when our bo@@ at appro@@ ach@@ ed , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed it would run over his tin@@ y c@@ ano@@ e ."
He was pe@@ tri@@ fi@@ ed he would be kno@@ c@@ ked in the water .

M@@ any of them dro@@ wn .
"For as long as he can re@@ call , he &apos;s been for@@ ced to work on the l@@ ake ."
"T@@ er@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed of his mas@@ ter , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been tre@@ ated with c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty all his life , he pas@@ ses that down to the youn@@ ger s@@ la@@ ves that he man@@ ages ."
"I met these b@@ oys at five in the mor@@ ning , when they were h@@ au@@ ling in the last of their ne@@ ts , but they had been working since 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
"@@ in the col@@ d , win@@ dy night ."
And it &apos;s important to n@@ ote that these ne@@ ts w@@ ei@@ gh more than a thous@@ and po@@ un@@ ds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to in@@ tro@@ duce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was res@@ cu@@ ed from a fis@@ hing v@@ ill@@ age .
I met him at a sh@@ el@@ ter where F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves re@@ ha@@ bil@@ it@@ ates v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of s@@ la@@ very .
"@@ Here he &apos;s seen taking a b@@ ath at the well , po@@ u@@ ring big b@@ uc@@ ke@@ ts of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , K@@ of@@ i has been re@@ uni@@ ted with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children saf@@ e ."
K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of possi@@ bility .
Wh@@ o will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
"D@@ ri@@ ving down a ro@@ ad in G@@ h@@ ana with par@@ t@@ ners of F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves , a fel@@ low ab@@ o@@ li@@ tion@@ ist on a mo@@ ped su@@ d@@ den@@ ly spe@@ d up to our c@@ ru@@ is@@ er and tap@@ ped on the win@@ do@@ w ."
He told us to fol@@ low him down a di@@ r@@ t ro@@ ad into the j@@ un@@ g@@ le .
"A@@ t the end of the ro@@ ad , he u@@ rg@@ ed us out of the car , and told the dri@@ ver to quickly leave ."
"Th@@ en he poin@@ ted to@@ ward this b@@ are@@ ly visi@@ ble fo@@ ot@@ pa@@ th , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the pa@@ th , this is the pa@@ th .

"A@@ f@@ ter another two hours of h@@ ik@@ ing , the win@@ ding tra@@ il ab@@ ru@@ p@@ tly en@@ ded at a c@@ lear@@ ing , and before us was a mas@@ s of h@@ oles that could f@@ it into the size of a fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all field , and all of them were full of en@@ s@@ la@@ ved people lab@@ or@@ ing ."
"M@@ any women had children str@@ ap@@ ped to their bac@@ ks while they were pan@@ ning for g@@ old , w@@ ad@@ ing in water po@@ is@@ on@@ ed by mer@@ cu@@ ry ."
M@@ er@@ cu@@ ry is used in the extra@@ ction process .

"In an age of global stri@@ fe and cli@@ mate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is sex so d@@ am@@ n good ?"
"If you &apos;re l@@ augh@@ ing , you know what I mean ."
"@@ Here &apos;s why . B@@ ack in uni@@ versity , we had a quic@@ k project to design some sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed clo@@ cks ."
Here &apos;s my clo@@ ck .
"It us@@ es something called the d@@ war@@ f sun@@ flo@@ wer , which gro@@ ws to about 12 in@@ ches in h@@ eight ."
"Now , as you know , sun@@ flo@@ wers tra@@ ck the su@@ n during the course of the day ."
"So in the mor@@ ning , you see which di@@ re@@ ction the sun@@ flo@@ wer is fac@@ ing , and you mar@@ k it on the b@@ lan@@ k area in the b@@ ase ."
"A@@ t no@@ on , you mar@@ k the changed posi@@ tion of the sun@@ flo@@ wer , and in the ev@@ en@@ ing again , and that &apos;s your clo@@ ck ."
"Now , I know my clo@@ ck doesn &apos;t tell you the ex@@ act time , but it does give you a gener@@ al idea using a flo@@ wer ."
"So , in my completely un@@ bi@@ as@@ ed , sub@@ je@@ ctive op@@ in@@ ion , it &apos;s bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , here &apos;s Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck ."
It &apos;s five mag@@ ni@@ f@@ ying g@@ las@@ ses with a sho@@ t g@@ las@@ s under each one .
In each sho@@ t g@@ las@@ s is a different s@@ cen@@ ted o@@ il .
"In the mor@@ ning , the sun@@ light will sh@@ ine down on the first mag@@ ni@@ f@@ ying g@@ las@@ s , fo@@ c@@ using a be@@ am of light on the sho@@ t g@@ las@@ s under@@ ne@@ ath ."
"This will war@@ m up the s@@ cen@@ ted o@@ il inside , and a particular s@@ me@@ ll will be em@@ it@@ ted ."
"So during the course of the day , five different s@@ mel@@ ls are dis@@ per@@ sed thro@@ ugh@@ out that environment ."
An@@ y@@ one living in that house can tell the time just by the s@@ me@@ ll .
You can see why I ha@@ te Ch@@ ris .
One thing you have to know about me is I ha@@ te to lo@@ se .
This problem &apos;s been bu@@ g@@ ging me for well over a dec@@ ad@@ e .
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why sex is so good ."
"M@@ any years after the sol@@ ar power@@ ed clo@@ cks project , a young la@@ dy I knew sug@@ g@@ es@@ ted maybe sex is so good because of the five sen@@ ses ."
"And when she said this , I had an epi@@ ph@@ any ."
So I decided to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate different experi@@ ences I had in my life from the point of view of the five sen@@ ses .
"To do this , I de@@ vis@@ ed something called the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h ."
"A@@ long the y@@ -@@ ax@@ is , you have a scale from z@@ ero to 10 , and along the x@@ -@@ ax@@ is , you have , of course , the five sen@@ ses ."
"A@@ ny@@ time I had a memor@@ able experience in my life , I would recor@@ d it on this grap@@ h like a five sen@@ ses di@@ ary ."
Here &apos;s a quic@@ k video to show you how it works .
"B@@ ike desig@@ ner : This is &#91; un@@ cle@@ ar &#93; , cus@@ to@@ m b@@ ike desig@@ ner ."
( Mo@@ tor@@ cy@@ le re@@ v@@ ving ) &#91; S@@ ound &#93; &#91; T@@ ou@@ ch &#93; &#91; Si@@ ght &#93; &#91; S@@ me@@ ll &#93; &#91; T@@ as@@ te &#93; J@@ L : And that &apos;s how the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h works .
So here are some other resul@@ ts .
The first is for in@@ st@@ ant no@@ od@@ les .
"Now obvi@@ ously , tas@@ te and s@@ me@@ ll are quite high , but no@@ tice sound is at three ."
"You know . ( S@@ lu@@ r@@ ps ) Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , I no longer d@@ ine with these people ."
"O@@ K , next , clu@@ b@@ b@@ ing ."
These people I still do h@@ an@@ g out with .
"A@@ ll right , and s@@ mo@@ king ."
"@@ Here I found to@@ uch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reas@@ ons is that s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers told me the sen@@ s@@ ation of h@@ ol@@ ding a ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ te and b@@ rin@@ ging it up to your li@@ ps is a big part of the s@@ mo@@ king experience , which sho@@ ws , it &apos;s kind of s@@ car@@ y to think how well ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ tes are desig@@ ned by the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers ."
"O@@ K . Now , what would the per@@ fect experience look like on the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h ?"
"It would , of course , be a hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal line along the top ."
"Now you can see , not even as in@@ ten@@ se an experience as ri@@ ding a mo@@ tor@@ b@@ ike comes close ."
"In fact , in the years that I ga@@ ther@@ ed data , only one experience came close to being the per@@ fect one ."
"That is , of course , sex . Gre@@ at sex ."
R@@ es@@ pon@@ dents said that great sex h@@ its all of the five sen@@ ses at an extre@@ me level .
So the five sen@@ ses theor@@ y does help expl@@ ain why sex is so good .
"Now in the middle of all this five sen@@ ses work , I su@@ d@@ den@@ ly remem@@ ber@@ ed the sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed clo@@ cks project from my y@@ outh ."
And I realized this theor@@ y also expl@@ ain@@ s why Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck is so much better than min@@ e .
"You see , my clo@@ ck only fo@@ cus@@ es on si@@ ght , and a little bit of to@@ uch ."
Here &apos;s Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck .
It &apos;s the first clo@@ ck ever that us@@ es s@@ me@@ ll to tell the time .
"In fact , in terms of the five sen@@ ses , Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck is a re@@ vol@@ ution ."
And that &apos;s what this theor@@ y tau@@ ght me about my field .
"You see , up ti@@ ll now , us desig@@ ners , we &apos;ve main@@ ly focu@@ sed on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of to@@ uch , which means we &apos;ve ig@@ nor@@ ed the other three sen@@ ses ."
Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck sho@@ ws us that even ra@@ is@@ ing just one of those other sen@@ ses can make for a bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant produc@@ t .
So what if we started using the five sen@@ ses theor@@ y in all of our desig@@ ns ?
Here &apos;s three quic@@ k ideas I came up with .
"We could call this &quot; &quot; the per@@ fu@@ ma@@ tor . &quot; &quot; All right , next ."
"So I b@@ rus@@ h my te@@ e@@ th tw@@ ice a day , and what if we had a to@@ oth@@ b@@ rus@@ h that tas@@ tes like can@@ dy , and when the tas@@ te of can@@ dy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your to@@ oth@@ b@@ rus@@ h ?"
"F@@ in@@ ally , I have a thing for the ke@@ ys on a flu@@ te or a c@@ lar@@ in@@ et ."
"It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you pre@@ ss down on them ."
"Now , I don &apos;t play the flu@@ te or the c@@ lar@@ in@@ et , so I decided to com@@ b@@ ine these ke@@ ys with an in@@ str@@ u@@ ment I do play : the tele@@ vision re@@ m@@ ote control ."
"Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll no@@ tice that the five sen@@ ses theor@@ y doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these produc@@ ts but also the way they look ."
"Now , I realize the five sen@@ ses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting ."
There &apos;s also the six emo@@ tions and that el@@ u@@ sive x@@ -@@ fac@@ tor .
M@@ ay@@ be that could be the to@@ pi@@ c of my next talk .
"U@@ n@@ til then , ple@@ ase have fu@@ n using the five sen@@ ses in your own lives and your own desig@@ ns ."
"O@@ h , one last thing before I leave ."
And the best way to do that is with free can@@ dy .
You guys ready ?
All right .
( Applause )
My first gra@@ de teach@@ er had this bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant idea .
She wanted us to experience rec@@ ei@@ ving gi@@ f@@ ts but also learning the vir@@ tu@@ e of com@@ pli@@ men@@ ting each other .
"So she had all of us come to the front of the clas@@ s@@ room , and she b@@ ou@@ ght all of us gi@@ f@@ ts and sta@@ c@@ ked them in the cor@@ ner ."
"If you hear your name called , go and pi@@ ck up your gi@@ ft and si@@ t down . &quot; &quot; What a wonderful idea , right ?"
"And then there were 20 people left , and 10 people left , and five left ..@@ ."
and three left .
And I was one of them .
And the com@@ pli@@ ments sto@@ pped .
"Well , at that moment , I was c@@ r@@ ying ."
And the teach@@ er was fre@@ aking out .
But I don &apos;t know who felt wor@@ se that day .
W@@ as it me or the teach@@ er ?
And without the hu@@ mor .
That &apos;s one ver@@ sion .
Th@@ en fas@@ t-@@ forward eight years .
I f@@ ell in love with that guy .
"I thought , w@@ ow , I know what I want to do now ."
"That night I w@@ ro@@ te a le@@ tter to my family telling them : &quot; &quot; B@@ y age 25 , I will build the big@@ gest company in the world , and that company will bu@@ y M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I to@@ tally em@@ bra@@ ced this idea of con@@ qu@@ er@@ ing the world — dom@@ in@@ ation , right ?"
"And I didn &apos;t make this up , I did write that le@@ tter ."
"And here it is — ( Laughter ) You don &apos;t have to read this through — ( Laughter ) This is also bad h@@ and@@ wri@@ ting , but I did high@@ light some key words ."
You get the idea .
( Laughter ) So ...
that was another ver@@ sion of me : one who will con@@ qu@@ er the world .
"Well , then two years later , I was presen@@ ted with the opportunity to come to the United States ."
"I j@@ um@@ ped on it , because that was where B@@ ill G@@ ates li@@ ved , right ?"
( Laughter ) I thought that was the start of my en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r jour@@ ney .
"Th@@ en , fas@@ t-@@ forward another 1@@ 4 years ."
I was 30 .
"N@@ o@@ pe , I didn &apos;t build that company ."
I didn &apos;t even start .
I was actually a marke@@ ting man@@ ag@@ er for a For@@ tu@@ ne 500 company .
And I felt I was stu@@ ck ; I was sta@@ gn@@ ant .
Why is that ?
Wh@@ ere is that 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year-@@ old who w@@ ro@@ te that le@@ tter ?
It &apos;s not because he didn &apos;t try .
One wanted to con@@ qu@@ er the world — make a difference — another was af@@ ra@@ id of re@@ je@@ ction .
And every time that si@@ x@@ -@@ year-@@ old won .
And this fe@@ ar even per@@ sis@@ ted after I started my own company .
"When I was an en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r , I was presen@@ ted with an inv@@ es@@ t@@ ment opportunity , and then I was turned down ."
And that re@@ je@@ ction hu@@ r@@ t me .
It hu@@ r@@ t me so bad that I wanted to qu@@ it right there .
"But then I thought , h@@ ey , would B@@ ill G@@ ates qu@@ it after a simple inv@@ es@@ t@@ ment re@@ je@@ ction ?"
W@@ ould any suc@@ cess@@ ful en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r qu@@ it like that ?
And this is where it cli@@ c@@ ked for me .
"O@@ K , I can build a better company ."
"I can build a better team or better produc@@ t , but one thing for sure : I &apos;ve got to be a better le@@ a@@ der ."
I &apos;ve got to be a better person .
I cannot let that si@@ x@@ -@@ year-@@ old keep dic@@ ta@@ ting my life any@@ more .
I have to put him back in his place .
So this is where I went on@@ line and looked for help .
Google was my friend .
"( Laughter ) I se@@ arch@@ ed , &quot; &quot; How do I over@@ come the fe@@ ar of re@@ je@@ ction ? &quot; &quot; I came up with a b@@ un@@ ch of psy@@ cho@@ logy ar@@ tic@@ les about where the fe@@ ar and pa@@ in are coming from ."
"Th@@ en I came up with a b@@ un@@ ch of &quot; &quot; ra@@ h@@ -@@ ra@@ h &quot; &quot; inspi@@ ra@@ tional ar@@ tic@@ les about &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t take it person@@ ally , just over@@ come it . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o doesn &apos;t know that ?"
( Laughter ) But why was I still so s@@ car@@ ed ?
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Re@@ je@@ ction Th@@ er@@ ap@@ y &quot; &quot; was this game inven@@ ted by this C@@ ana@@ di@@ an en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r .
H@@ is name is J@@ as@@ on C@@ ome@@ ly .
"And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for re@@ je@@ ction , and every day get re@@ je@@ cted at something , and then by the end , you de@@ sen@@ si@@ ti@@ ze yourself from the pa@@ in ."
And I lo@@ ved that idea .
"( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? I &apos;m going to do this ."
"And I &apos;ll feel myself getting re@@ je@@ cted 100 days . &quot; &quot; And I came up with my own re@@ je@@ ction ideas , and I made a video blo@@ g out of it ."
And so here &apos;s what I did .
This is what the blo@@ g looked like .
D@@ ay One ...
( Laughter ) Bor@@ row 100 dollars from a str@@ ang@@ er .
So this is where I went to where I was working .
I came do@@ w@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s and I saw this big guy sitting behind a des@@ k .
He looked like a se@@ cur@@ ity gu@@ ard .
So I just appro@@ ach@@ ed him .
"And I was just wal@@ king and that was the lon@@ gest walk of my life — h@@ air on the back of my ne@@ ck standing up , I was s@@ we@@ ating and my heart was po@@ un@@ ding ."
"And I got there and said , &quot; H@@ ey , si@@ r , can I bor@@ row 100 dollars from you ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) And he looked up , he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot;"
( Laughter ) I felt so em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sed .
"But because I fil@@ med myself — so that night I was wat@@ ching myself getting re@@ je@@ cted , I just saw how s@@ car@@ ed I was ."
I looked like this ki@@ d in &quot; &quot; The S@@ ix@@ th S@@ en@@ se . &quot; &quot; I saw de@@ ad people .
( Laughter ) But then I saw this guy .
"You know , he wasn &apos;t that men@@ ac@@ ing ."
"He was a ch@@ u@@ b@@ by , lo@@ ve@@ able guy , and he even asked me , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; In fact , he in@@ vi@@ ted me to expl@@ ain myself ."
And I could &apos;ve said many things .
"I could &apos;ve expl@@ ain@@ ed , I could &apos;ve ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ated ."
I didn &apos;t do any of that .
All I did was run .
"I felt , w@@ ow , this is like a micro@@ cos@@ m of my life ."
"E@@ very time I felt the sli@@ gh@@ test re@@ je@@ ction , I would just run as f@@ ast as I could ."
And you know what ?
"The next day , no matter what happens , I &apos;m not going to run ."
I &apos;ll sta@@ y eng@@ ag@@ ed .
"D@@ ay T@@ w@@ o : R@@ equ@@ est a &quot; &quot; bu@@ rg@@ er re@@ f@@ ill . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s when I went to a bu@@ rg@@ er jo@@ in@@ t , I fin@@ is@@ hed l@@ un@@ ch , and I went to the cas@@ hi@@ er and said , &quot; H@@ i , can I get a bu@@ rg@@ er re@@ f@@ ill ? &quot; ( Laughter )"
"He was all con@@ fu@@ sed , like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a bu@@ rg@@ er re@@ f@@ ill ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s just like a d@@ rin@@ k re@@ f@@ ill but with a bu@@ rg@@ er . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ or@@ ry , we don &apos;t do bu@@ rg@@ er re@@ f@@ ill , man . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So this is where re@@ je@@ ction happened and I could have run , but I sta@@ y@@ ed ."
"And by the way , I don &apos;t think they &apos;ve ever done bu@@ rg@@ er re@@ f@@ ill ."
( Laughter ) I think they &apos;re still there .
"I said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , great , I &apos;m already learning things ."
Gre@@ at . &quot; &quot; And then D@@ ay Th@@ ree : G@@ e@@ tting O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c D@@ ou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts .
This is where my life was turned up@@ side down .
I went to a K@@ ris@@ py K@@ re@@ me .
"I &apos;m sure they have some here , too ."
"And I went in , I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you make me d@@ ou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts that look like O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c sym@@ b@@ ols ?"
"B@@ as@@ ically , you inter@@ lin@@ k five d@@ ou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts together ... &quot; &quot; I mean there &apos;s no way they could say y@@ es , right ?"
The d@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut mak@@ er took me so ser@@ i@@ ously .
"( Laughter ) So she put out pap@@ er , started j@@ ot@@ ting down the col@@ ors and the rin@@ gs , and is like , &quot; &quot; How can I make this ? &quot; &quot; And then 15 minutes later , she came out with a box that looked like O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c rin@@ gs ."
And I was so to@@ uch@@ ed .
I just couldn &apos;t believe it .
And that video got over five million vie@@ ws on Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be .
The world couldn &apos;t believe that either .
And I became f@@ am@@ ous .
"A lot of people started wri@@ ting ema@@ il@@ s to me and saying , &quot; &quot; What you &apos;re doing is aw@@ es@@ ome . &quot; &quot; But you know , f@@ ame and no@@ to@@ ri@@ e@@ ty did not do anything to me ."
I wanted to see what I could learn .
And then I learned a lot of things .
I disco@@ vered so many se@@ cre@@ ts .
"( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; But before he could leave I said , &quot; H@@ ey , can I know why ? &quot;"
I went across and kno@@ c@@ ked on Con@@ ni@@ e &apos;s do@@ or .
And she was so happy to see me .
"( Laughter ) And then half an h@@ our later , there was this flo@@ wer in Con@@ ni@@ e &apos;s bac@@ ky@@ ard ."
It was n@@ one of those .
It was because what I of@@ fer@@ ed did not f@@ it what he wanted .
"And he tr@@ us@@ ted me enough to of@@ fer me a re@@ fer@@ ral , using a sal@@ es ter@@ m ."
I con@@ ver@@ ted a re@@ fer@@ ral .
Th@@ en one day — and I also learned that I can actually say certain things and ma@@ xi@@ miz@@ e my chan@@ ce to get a y@@ es .
"So for example , one day I went to a S@@ tar@@ b@@ uc@@ ks , and asked the man@@ ag@@ er , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , can I be a S@@ tar@@ b@@ uc@@ ks gre@@ e@@ ter ? &quot; &quot; He was like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a S@@ tar@@ b@@ uc@@ ks gre@@ e@@ ter ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o you know those W@@ al@@ mar@@ t gre@@ e@@ ters ?"
"You know , those people who say &apos; h@@ i &apos; to you before you walk in the sto@@ re , and make sure you don &apos;t ste@@ al stuff , basically ?"
"I want to give a W@@ al@@ mar@@ t experience to S@@ tar@@ b@@ uc@@ ks cus@@ to@@ mers . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s a good thing , actually — A@@ c@@ tually , I &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s a bad thing ."
"And he was like , &quot; &quot; Oh &quot; &quot; — ye@@ ah , this is how he looked , his name is E@@ ri@@ c — and he was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; This is how he was hear@@ ing me . &quot; &quot; N@@ ot sure . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I ask him , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that w@@ ei@@ r@@ d ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s really w@@ ei@@ r@@ d , man . &quot; &quot; But as so@@ on as he said that , his whole de@@ me@@ an@@ or changed ."
It &apos;s as if he &apos;s pu@@ tting all the d@@ ou@@ b@@ t on the flo@@ or .
"I said &quot; &quot; h@@ i &quot; &quot; to every cus@@ to@@ mer that wal@@ ked in , and gave them ho@@ li@@ day che@@ ers ."
"But then I found I could do this because I men@@ tion@@ ed , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that w@@ ei@@ r@@ d ? &quot; &quot; I men@@ tion@@ ed the d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that he was having ."
"And because I men@@ tion@@ ed , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that w@@ ei@@ r@@ d ? &quot; &quot; , that means I wasn &apos;t w@@ ei@@ r@@ d ."
"That means I was actually thinking just like him , seeing this as a w@@ ei@@ r@@ d thing ."
And then I learned I could ful@@ f@@ ill my life dre@@ am ...
"You know , I came from four gener@@ ations of teach@@ ers , and my grand@@ ma has always told me , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey J@@ ia , you can do anything you want , but it &apos;d be great if you became a teach@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But I wanted to be an en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r , so I didn &apos;t ."
But it has always been my dre@@ am to actually te@@ ach something .
But because I didn &apos;t run — I kep@@ t doing it — and on the third try the pro@@ fes@@ s@@ or was very im@@ pres@@ sed .
"He was like , &quot; &quot; No one has done this before . &quot; &quot; And I came in pre@@ par@@ ed with power@@ poin@@ ts and my le@@ s@@ son ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I can use this ."
Why don &apos;t you come back in two months ? I &apos;ll f@@ it you in my cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m . &quot; &quot; And two months later I was teach@@ ing a clas@@ s .
"This is me — you probably can &apos;t see , this is a bad picture ."
"You know , sometimes you get re@@ je@@ cted by li@@ gh@@ ting , you know ?"
"I used to think I have to ac@@ com@@ pl@@ ish all these things — have to be a great en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r , or get a P@@ h@@ D to te@@ ach — but no , I just asked , and I could te@@ ach ."
"And in that picture , which you can &apos;t see , I quot@@ ed Mar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world , who change the way we live and the way we think , are the people who were met with in@@ iti@@ al and often viol@@ ent re@@ je@@ ctions ."
"P@@ e@@ ople like Mar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r . , like Ma@@ ha@@ t@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i , N@@ el@@ son Man@@ de@@ la , or even J@@ e@@ su@@ s Chris@@ t ."
These people did not let re@@ je@@ ction defin@@ e them .
They let their own re@@ action after re@@ je@@ ction defin@@ e themselves .
And they em@@ bra@@ ced re@@ je@@ ction .
It has bo@@ ther@@ ed me my whole life because I was run@@ ning away from it .
Th@@ en I started em@@ bra@@ cing it .
I turned that into the big@@ gest gi@@ ft in my life .
I started teach@@ ing people how to turn re@@ je@@ ctions into oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties .
"When you get re@@ je@@ cted in life , when you are fac@@ ing the next ob@@ sta@@ cle or next fa@@ il@@ u@@ re , consi@@ der the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties ."
D@@ on &apos;t run .
"If you just em@@ bra@@ ce them , they might become your gi@@ f@@ ts as well ."
Thank you .
I came to America .
"B@@ y that time , my sta@@ ff po@@ u@@ red into my off@@ ice ."
They were s@@ car@@ ed to death .
I was very happy . I was deli@@ gh@@ ted with the out@@ come of my work .
"This time , we all are going to be kil@@ led ."
"A@@ t that time , she said , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , you go next time , and you will help them ."
We were going every@@ where .
But you know what happened to my country .
"T@@ o@@ day , people cannot walk out of their do@@ or without se@@ cur@@ ity issu@@ es ."
"They are tra@@ in@@ ing to be doc@@ tors , back again ."
"And I tell you , we could ."
"Th@@ ank you very , very much ."
"This is where I live . I live in Ken@@ y@@ a , at the s@@ outh parts of the N@@ ai@@ ro@@ bi Na@@ tional Par@@ k ."
"Th@@ ose are my d@@ ad &apos;s co@@ ws at the back , and behind the co@@ ws , that &apos;s the N@@ ai@@ ro@@ bi Na@@ tional Par@@ k ."
"N@@ ai@@ ro@@ bi Na@@ tional Par@@ k is not f@@ en@@ ced in the s@@ outh w@@ ide@@ ly , which means wil@@ d animals like z@@ eb@@ ras mi@@ gra@@ te out of the par@@ k fre@@ ely ."
"So pre@@ da@@ tors like lions fol@@ low them , and this is what they do ."
They k@@ ill our li@@ v@@ es@@ to@@ ck .
"This is one of the co@@ ws which was kil@@ led at night , and I just wo@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning and I found it de@@ ad , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bu@@ ll we had ."
"My community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from he@@ av@@ en with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we val@@ ue them so much ."
So I gre@@ w up ha@@ ting lions so much .
"The mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who prote@@ ct our community and the li@@ v@@ es@@ to@@ ck , and they &apos;re also up@@ set about this problem ."
So they k@@ ill the lions .
It &apos;s one of the six lions which were kil@@ led in N@@ ai@@ ro@@ bi .
And I think this is why the N@@ ai@@ ro@@ bi Na@@ tional Par@@ k lions are few .
"So a bo@@ y , from six to n@@ ine years old , in my community is respon@@ si@@ ble for his d@@ ad &apos;s co@@ ws , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me ."
So I had to find a way of sol@@ ving this problem .
"And the first idea I got was to use fi@@ re , because I thought lions were s@@ car@@ ed of fi@@ re ."
"But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even hel@@ ping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed ."
So I didn &apos;t give up . I contin@@ u@@ ed .
And a second idea I got was to use a s@@ care@@ cro@@ w .
I was trying to tri@@ ck the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing ne@@ ar the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed .
"But lions are very cle@@ ver . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the s@@ care@@ cro@@ w , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he j@@ um@@ ps in and kil@@ ls the animals ."
"So one night , I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed with a tor@@ ch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come ."
And I disco@@ vered that lions are af@@ ra@@ id of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
"S@@ in@@ ce I was a small bo@@ y , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took ap@@ art my mo@@ m &apos;s new ra@@ dio , and that day she almost kil@@ led me , but I learned a lot about elec@@ tron@@ ics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car bat@@ ter@@ y , an in@@ dic@@ ato@@ r box . It &apos;s a small dev@@ ice found in a mo@@ tor@@ cy@@ cle , and it hel@@ ps mo@@ to@@ ris@@ ts when they want to turn right or left . It blin@@ ks ."
"And I got a s@@ wit@@ ch where I can s@@ wit@@ ch on the li@@ ghts , on and off ."
And that &apos;s a small tor@@ ch from a bro@@ k@@ en f@@ las@@ h@@ light .
So I set up everything .
"As you can see , the sol@@ ar pan@@ el char@@ ges the bat@@ ter@@ y , and the bat@@ ter@@ y sup@@ pli@@ es the power to the small in@@ dic@@ ato@@ r box . I call it a trans@@ for@@ mer ."
And the in@@ dic@@ ato@@ r box makes the li@@ ghts f@@ las@@ h .
"As you can see , the bu@@ l@@ bs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from ."
And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
"The li@@ ghts f@@ las@@ h and tri@@ ck the lions into thinking I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed , but I was s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing in my bed ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks .
"So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experi@@ en@@ ced any problem with lions ."
And my n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ing h@@ om@@ es heard about this idea .
One of them was this grand@@ mother .
"She had a lot of her animals being kil@@ led by lions , and she asked me if I could put the li@@ ghts for her ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the li@@ ghts . You can see at the back , those are the lion li@@ ghts ."
"S@@ in@@ ce now , I &apos;ve set up seven h@@ om@@ es around my community , and they &apos;re really working ."
"And my idea is also being used now all over Ken@@ y@@ a for s@@ car@@ ing other pre@@ da@@ tors like hy@@ enas , le@@ o@@ par@@ ds , and it &apos;s also being used to s@@ care ele@@ ph@@ an@@ ts away from people &apos;s far@@ ms ."
"Because of this inven@@ tion , I was l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to get a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best scho@@ ols in Ken@@ y@@ a , B@@ ro@@ ok@@ house In@@ ter@@ national S@@ cho@@ ol , and I &apos;m really exci@@ ted about this ."
My new school now is coming in and hel@@ ping by fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing and cre@@ ating an a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
"I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re in@@ st@@ all@@ ing the li@@ ghts to the h@@ om@@ es which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teach@@ ing them how to put them ."
"So one year ago , I was just a bo@@ y in the sav@@ an@@ na g@@ ras@@ s@@ land her@@ ding my father &apos;s co@@ ws , and I used to see plan@@ es fl@@ ying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside ."
And here I am today .
I got a chan@@ ce to come by plan@@ e for my first time for TED .
So my big dre@@ am is to become an air@@ cra@@ ft engine@@ er and pi@@ lot when I grow up .
"I used to ha@@ te lions , but now because my inven@@ tion is sav@@ ing my father &apos;s co@@ ws and the lions , we are able to sta@@ y with the lions without any con@@ fli@@ ct ."
"A@@ sh@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n . It means in my language , than@@ k you very much ."
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : You have no idea how exci@@ ting it is to hear a story like y@@ ours .
So you got this sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p@@ .@@ Ri@@ char@@ d T@@ ur@@ ere : Y@@ ep .
C@@ A : You &apos;re working on other electri@@ cal inven@@ tions .

"@@ R@@ T : But I know electri@@ c f@@ ences are already inven@@ ted , but I want to make min@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A : You already tried it once , right , and you — R@@ T : I tried it before , but I sto@@ pped because it gave me a sho@@ ck . ( Laughter ) C@@ A : In the tr@@ en@@ ches . Ri@@ char@@ d T@@ ur@@ ere , you are something else ."
"We &apos;re going to che@@ er you on every step of the way , my friend ."

Y@@ our food will be ser@@ ved shor@@ tly .
"( Applause ) M@@ ay@@ a P@@ en@@ n : I &apos;ve been dra@@ wing ever since I could hold a cra@@ y@@ on , and I &apos;ve been making anima@@ ted fli@@ p books since I was three years old ."
"A@@ t that age , I also learned about what an anima@@ tor was ."
There was a program on T@@ V about j@@ ob@@ s most kids don &apos;t know about .
"When I under@@ sto@@ od that an anima@@ tor makes the car@@ to@@ ons I saw on T@@ V , I im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I want to be . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said it men@@ tally or out l@@ ou@@ d , but that was a gre@@ at@@ ly defin@@ ing moment in my life ."
A@@ ni@@ ma@@ tion and art has always been my first love .
"It was my love for technology that s@@ par@@ ked the idea for &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ ic@@ i@@ ous D@@ is@@ h@@ es . &quot; &quot; There was a vir@@ us on my computer , and I was trying to get ri@@ d of it , and all of a su@@ d@@ den , I just thought , what if vi@@ rus@@ es have their own little world inside the computer ?"
M@@ ay@@ be a re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant where they me@@ et up and do vi@@ rus@@ y things ?
"And th@@ us , &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ ic@@ i@@ ous D@@ is@@ h@@ es &quot; &quot; was born ."
"A@@ t four years old , my d@@ ad sho@@ wed me how to take ap@@ art a computer and put it back together again ."
That started my love for technology .
"I built my first w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite myself in H@@ T@@ M@@ L , and I &apos;m learning J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt and P@@ y@@ thon ."
I &apos;m also working on an anima@@ ted ser@@ ies called &quot; &quot; The P@@ ol@@ lin@@ a@@ tors . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about be@@ es and other pol@@ lin@@ a@@ tors in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
"If plan@@ ts ar@@ en &apos;t pol@@ lin@@ ated by the pol@@ lin@@ a@@ tors , then all crea@@ tures , inclu@@ ding ourselves , that depen@@ d on these plan@@ ts , would star@@ ve ."
So I decided to take these co@@ ol crea@@ tures and make a super@@ her@@ o team .
( Applause ) ( F@@ o@@ ot sto@@ m@@ p ) ( Music ) ( R@@ o@@ ar ) P@@ ol@@ lin@@ ato@@ r : De@@ for@@ es@@ ts@@ au@@ r@@ us ! I should have known !
I need to call on the rest of the P@@ ol@@ lin@@ a@@ tors !
"( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my anima@@ tions start with ideas , but what are ideas ?"
I@@ de@@ as can s@@ par@@ k a movement .
I@@ de@@ as are oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties and innov@@ ation .
I@@ de@@ as tru@@ ly are what make the world go ro@@ und .
"If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , me@@ dic@@ ine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives ."
"A@@ t eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called M@@ ay@@ a &apos;s I@@ de@@ as , and my non@@ pro@@ f@@ it , M@@ ay@@ a &apos;s I@@ de@@ as for the P@@ lan@@ et ."
( Laughter ) And I make e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly clo@@ thing and ac@@ ces@@ sor@@ ies .
"I &apos;m 1@@ 3 now , and al@@ though I started my business in 200@@ 8 , my arti@@ sti@@ c jour@@ ney started way before then ."
"I was gre@@ at@@ ly in@@ flu@@ en@@ ced by art , and I wanted to in@@ cor@@ po@@ rate it in everything I did , even my business ."
"I would find different f@@ ab@@ ri@@ cs around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a s@@ car@@ f or a h@@ at , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for desig@@ ns ."
"I no@@ tic@@ ed when I wor@@ e my cre@@ ations , people would stop me and say , &quot; W@@ ow , that &apos;s really cu@@ te . Wh@@ ere can I get one ? &quot;"
"And I thought , I can start my own business ."
Now I didn &apos;t have any business plan@@ s at only eight years old .
I only knew I wanted to make pretty cre@@ ations that were saf@@ e for the environment and I wanted to give back .
"My mo@@ m tau@@ ght me how to se@@ w , and on my back por@@ ch , I would si@@ t and make little head@@ b@@ ands out of ri@@ b@@ b@@ on , and I would write down the n@@ ames and the pri@@ ce of each ite@@ m ."
"I started making more ite@@ ms like ha@@ ts , s@@ car@@ ves and b@@ ag@@ s ."
"S@@ o@@ on , my ite@@ ms began sel@@ ling all over the world , and I had cus@@ to@@ mers in D@@ en@@ mar@@ k , I@@ tal@@ y , Aus@@ tr@@ alia , C@@ an@@ ada and more ."
"Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like b@@ ran@@ ding and marke@@ ting , sta@@ ying eng@@ ag@@ ed with my cus@@ to@@ mers , and seeing what sol@@ d the most and the least ."
"S@@ o@@ on , my business really started to take off ."
"Th@@ en one day , For@@ bes mag@@ az@@ ine con@@ ta@@ cted me when I was 10 years old ."
( Laughter ) They wanted to fe@@ a@@ ture me and my company in their ar@@ tic@@ le .
"Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly ?"
I &apos;ve had a passion for prote@@ cting the environment and its crea@@ tures since I was little .
My parents tau@@ ght me at an early age about giving back and being a good ste@@ ward to the environment .
"I heard about how the dy@@ es in some clo@@ thing or the process of even making the ite@@ ms was har@@ m@@ ful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I disco@@ vered that even after dy@@ e@@ ing has being comple@@ ted , there is a was@@ te issu@@ e that gi@@ ves a ne@@ ga@@ tive imp@@ act on the environment ."
"For example , the g@@ rin@@ ding of materi@@ als , or the du@@ m@@ ping of dri@@ ed po@@ w@@ der materi@@ als ."
"Th@@ ese ac@@ tions can pol@@ lu@@ te the air , making it to@@ x@@ ic to any@@ one or anything that in@@ hal@@ es it ."
"So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my ite@@ ms had to be e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly , and 10 to 20 percent of the pro@@ f@@ its I made went to local and global char@@ i@@ ties and environ@@ mental organ@@ iz@@ ations ."
"( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new wa@@ ve of en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ s that not only se@@ eks to have a suc@@ cess@@ ful business , but also a susta@@ in@@ able future ."
I feel that I can me@@ et the needs of my cus@@ to@@ mers without com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ing the ability of future gener@@ ations to live in a gre@@ en@@ er to@@ mor@@ row .
"We live in a big , di@@ verse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more pas@@ sion@@ ate to sa@@ ve it ."
But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your head@@ s about the things that are happening in our world .
"It takes to get it through your hear@@ ts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when move@@ ments are s@@ par@@ ked ."
"That is when oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties and innov@@ ation are created , and that is why ideas come to life ."
"Th@@ ank you , and pe@@ ace and b@@ le@@ ss@@ ings ."
"( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) P@@ at M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell : So , you heard M@@ ay@@ a talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredi@@ ble woman . Wh@@ ere are they ?"
"P@@ le@@ ase , M@@ r. and M@@ r@@ s@@ . P@@ en@@ n . W@@ ould you just — A@@ h !"
( Applause )
"When I was seven years old , I saw my first public exe@@ cu@@ tion ."
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a Nor@@ th Kor@@ ean re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e .
"If anything see@@ med un@@ natural , I could be im@@ pris@@ on@@ ed and re@@ pa@@ tri@@ ated ."
"E@@ ven though I was really for@@ tun@@ ate to get out , many other Nor@@ th Kor@@ e@@ ans have not been so l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ."
"E@@ ven after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned up@@ side down in an in@@ st@@ ant ."
"We are all Kor@@ ean , but inside , we have become very different , du@@ e to 6@@ 7 years of di@@ vision ."
A@@ m I S@@ outh Kor@@ ean or Nor@@ th Kor@@ ean ?
So I started plan@@ ning how to help them es@@ cap@@ e .
I was so surpris@@ ed that a to@@ tal str@@ ang@@ er car@@ ed enough to ask .
I realized that this was a sym@@ bo@@ lic moment in my life .
This is a kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten we desig@@ ned in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten to be a cir@@ cle .
It &apos;s a kind of en@@ d@@ less cir@@ cu@@ lation on top of the ro@@ of .
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we design this ?
"The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al of this kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ sis@@ ted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sti@@ c@@ king out from the ed@@ ge of the ro@@ of ?"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es po@@ p@@ ping through .
And we were allo@@ wed to call this ro@@ pe as a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il .
"But of course , ro@@ pe has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times 40 children are around a tre@@ e .
"The bo@@ y on the b@@ ran@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the tre@@ e so he is e@@ ating the tre@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they si@@ t on the ed@@ ge ."
It looks so n@@ ice from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys in the zo@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ e@@ ding time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the c@@ ei@@ ling ."
And the le@@ g was@@ hing place — there are many kinds of water tap@@ s .
"You see with the f@@ lex@@ i@@ ble tu@@ bes , you want to sp@@ ra@@ y water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in front is quite nor@@ mal ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not was@@ hing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s pu@@ tting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this archite@@ c@@ ture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
So there is no ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ c bar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qui@@ et box , some of them get really ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ v@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary .
"And the prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to sta@@ y in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back ev@@ en@@ tually , because it &apos;s a cir@@ cle , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of oc@@ cas@@ ion , usu@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ dly , we consi@@ der no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qui@@ et space .
"And in this kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten , these children show amazing con@@ cen@@ tra@@ tion in clas@@ s ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the j@@ un@@ g@@ le with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not sup@@ posed to be in sil@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control ."
"You know , it &apos;s completely open ."
And you should know that we can go sk@@ i@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in win@@ ter .
In sum@@ mer you go s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
You never mel@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are sup@@ posed to be outside ."
So that is how we should tre@@ at them .
This is how they divi@@ de clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
They are sup@@ posed to help teach@@ ers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A clas@@ s@@ room .
And a was@@ h@@ bas@@ in .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the clas@@ s@@ room .
A mon@@ key trying to fish another mon@@ key from ab@@ o@@ ve .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each clas@@ s@@ room has at least one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ anta C@@ lau@@ s comes down at the time of Chris@@ t@@ mas .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ shap@@ ed kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten ."
The building is only five me@@ ters t@@ all with seven flo@@ ors .
"And of course , the c@@ ei@@ ling h@@ eight is very low ."
So you have to consi@@ der sa@@ fe@@ ty .
"So , we put our children , a d@@ aughter and a son ."
They tried to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s o@@ kay . H@@ is sk@@ u@@ ll is quite st@@ rong .
He is re@@ si@@ li@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is saf@@ e to j@@ um@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ f@@ fic j@@ am is aw@@ ful in T@@ o@@ ky@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in front , she needs to learn how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now these days , kids need a small dos@@ age of dang@@ er ."
"And in this kind of oc@@ cas@@ ion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are lo@@ sing these days .
"Now , this dra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the movement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 me@@ ters in the mor@@ ning ."
But the surpris@@ e is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 me@@ ters on a@@ verage ."
And these children have the high@@ est ath@@ le@@ tic ab@@ ili@@ ties a@@ mon@@ g many kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten@@ s .
"The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
"My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t prote@@ ct them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble sometimes ."
They need to get some in@@ ju@@ ry .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
"I think archite@@ c@@ ture is cap@@ able of chan@@ ging this world , and people &apos;s lives ."
And this is one of the at@@ tem@@ p@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Here are some images of cl@@ us@@ ters of gal@@ ax@@ ies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
"They are these huge colle@@ ctions of gal@@ ax@@ ies , b@@ ound together by their mu@@ tual gra@@ v@@ ity ."
"So most of the poin@@ ts that you see on the scre@@ en are not individu@@ al star@@ s , but colle@@ ctions of star@@ s , or gal@@ ax@@ ies ."
"Now , by sho@@ wing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that gal@@ ax@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters are these beautiful ob@@ jects , but more than that , I think gal@@ ax@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters are my@@ s@@ teri@@ ous , they are surpris@@ ing , and they &apos;re u@@ se@@ ful ."
U@@ se@@ ful as the universe &apos;s most mas@@ sive lab@@ or@@ ato@@ ries .
"And as lab@@ or@@ ato@@ ries , to descri@@ be gal@@ ax@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters is to descri@@ be the experi@@ ments that you can do with them ."
"And I think there are four maj@@ or ty@@ pes , and the first ty@@ pe that I want to descri@@ be is prob@@ ing the very big ."
"So , how big ?"
"Well , here is an image of a particular gal@@ ax@@ y cl@@ us@@ ter ."
"It is so mas@@ sive that the light pas@@ sing through it is being b@@ ent , it &apos;s being dis@@ tor@@ ted by the extre@@ me gra@@ v@@ ity of this cl@@ us@@ ter ."
"And , in fact , if you look very care@@ fully you &apos;ll be able to see rin@@ gs around this cl@@ us@@ ter ."
"Now , to give you a number , this particular gal@@ ax@@ y cl@@ us@@ ter has a mas@@ s of over one million billion sun@@ s ."
It &apos;s just min@@ d-@@ bo@@ g@@ g@@ ling how mas@@ sive these systems can get .
"But more than their mas@@ s , they have this ad@@ di@@ tional fe@@ a@@ ture ."
"They are es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally is@@ ol@@ ated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scal@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sion of the entire universe ."
"And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scal@@ es , such as , how does gra@@ v@@ ity work ?"
might be ans@@ wer@@ ed by stu@@ dy@@ ing these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very ho@@ t .
"O@@ kay , if I take an image of a gal@@ ax@@ y cl@@ us@@ ter , and I sub@@ tra@@ ct away all of the star@@ light , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blu@@ e blo@@ b ."
This is in fal@@ se co@@ lor .
It &apos;s actually X@@ -@@ ra@@ y light that we &apos;re seeing .
"And the question is , if it &apos;s not gal@@ ax@@ ies , what is em@@ it@@ ting this light ?"
"The answer is ho@@ t g@@ as , mil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e g@@ as — in fact , it &apos;s plas@@ ma ."
And the reason why it &apos;s so ho@@ t goes back to the pre@@ vi@@ ous sli@@ de .
"The extre@@ me gra@@ v@@ ity of these systems is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating par@@ tic@@ les of g@@ as to great spe@@ e@@ ds , and great spe@@ e@@ ds means great tem@@ per@@ a@@ tures ."
"So this is the ma@@ in idea , but science is a ro@@ ugh dra@@ ft ."
"There are many bas@@ ic pro@@ per@@ ties about this plas@@ ma that still con@@ fu@@ se us , still pu@@ z@@ z@@ le us , and still pus@@ h our under@@ standing of the physi@@ cs of the very ho@@ t ."
Th@@ ird thing : prob@@ ing the very small .
"Now , to expl@@ ain this , I need to tell you a very dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing fact ."
M@@ os@@ t of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of ato@@ ms .
You were li@@ ed to .
"M@@ os@@ t of it is made up of something very , very my@@ s@@ teri@@ ous , which we call dar@@ k matter ."
"D@@ ar@@ k matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to inter@@ act very much , ex@@ cept through gra@@ v@@ ity , and of course we would like to learn more about it ."
"If you &apos;re a par@@ tic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist , you want to know what happens when we s@@ mas@@ h things together ."
And dar@@ k matter is no ex@@ cep@@ tion .
"Well , how do we do this ?"
"To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when gal@@ ax@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters col@@ li@@ de ?"
Here is an image .
"S@@ in@@ ce gal@@ ax@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters are re@@ presen@@ ta@@ tive sli@@ ces of the universe , scal@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sions ."
"They are mo@@ st@@ ly made up of dar@@ k matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this blu@@ ish pur@@ ple ."
"The red re@@ presen@@ ts the ho@@ t g@@ as , and , of course , you can see many gal@@ ax@@ ies ."
"What &apos;s happened is a par@@ tic@@ le ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ato@@ r at a huge , huge scale ."
"And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effe@@ cts that might be difficult to de@@ te@@ ct in the la@@ b , might be com@@ po@@ un@@ ded and com@@ po@@ un@@ ded into something that we could possi@@ bly ob@@ ser@@ ve in nature ."
"So , it &apos;s very fun@@ n@@ y ."
"The reason why gal@@ ax@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters can te@@ ach us about dar@@ k matter , the reason why gal@@ ax@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters can te@@ ach us about the physi@@ cs of the very small , is pre@@ c@@ is@@ ely because they are so very big ."
F@@ our@@ th thing : the physi@@ cs of the very str@@ an@@ ge .
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly what I &apos;ve said so far is cra@@ z@@ y .
"O@@ kay , if there &apos;s anything str@@ ang@@ er I think it has to be dar@@ k energy ."
"If I thro@@ w a b@@ all into the air , I expe@@ ct it to go up ."
What I don &apos;t expe@@ ct is that it go up at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing rate .
"S@@ im@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , cos@@ mo@@ logis@@ ts understand why the universe is ex@@ pan@@ ding ."
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s ex@@ pan@@ ding at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing rate .
"They give the cause of this ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated ex@@ pan@@ sion a name , and they call it dar@@ k energy ."
"And , again , we want to learn more about it ."
"So , one particular question that we have is , how does dar@@ k energy af@@ fect the universe at the lar@@ gest scal@@ es ?"
"D@@ epen@@ ding on how st@@ rong it is , maybe struc@@ ture for@@ ms fas@@ ter or s@@ lo@@ wer ."
"Well , the problem with the lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale struc@@ ture of the universe is that it &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ bly com@@ plic@@ ated ."
Here is a computer si@@ mu@@ lation .
And we need a way to sim@@ pli@@ f@@ y it .
"Well , I like to think about this using an anal@@ og@@ y ."
"If I want to understand the sin@@ king of the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little posi@@ tions of every single little piece of the bo@@ at that bro@@ ke off ."
The most important thing to do is to tra@@ ck the two big@@ gest parts .
"S@@ im@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the lar@@ gest scal@@ es by tra@@ c@@ king its big@@ gest pie@@ ces and those big@@ gest pie@@ ces are cl@@ us@@ ters of gal@@ ax@@ ies ."
"So , as I come to a close , you might feel sli@@ gh@@ tly che@@ ated ."
"I mean , I began by talking about how gal@@ ax@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters are u@@ se@@ ful , and I &apos;ve given some reas@@ ons , but what is their use really ?"
"Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quot@@ e by H@@ en@@ ry For@@ d when he was asked about cars ."
"He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said fas@@ ter hor@@ ses . &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day , we as a society are fac@@ ed with many , many difficult problems ."
And the solu@@ tions to these problems are not obvi@@ ous .
They are not fas@@ ter hor@@ ses .
They will re@@ qui@@ re an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of scienti@@ fic in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity .
"So , y@@ es , we need to focu@@ s , y@@ es , we need to con@@ cen@@ tra@@ te , but we also need to remember that innov@@ ation , in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity , inspi@@ ra@@ tion — these things come when we bro@@ a@@ den our field of vision when we step back when we zo@@ om out ."
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by stu@@ dy@@ ing the universe around us . Th@@ an@@ ks .

"A@@ t the time , I was car@@ dio@@ logis@@ t at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , speci@@ al@@ iz@@ ing in car@@ dia@@ c ima@@ ging tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es ."
The call came from a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an at the L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es Z@@ o@@ o .
An el@@ der@@ ly fe@@ mal@@ e chim@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ e had wo@@ k@@ en up with a fac@@ i@@ al dro@@ o@@ p and the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were wor@@ ried that she &apos;d had a stro@@ ke .
"And oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally , on the very same day , I went on ro@@ un@@ ds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A Me@@ di@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter and at the L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es Z@@ o@@ o ."
And here &apos;s what started coming into very cle@@ ar focu@@ s for me .
"E@@ ven though I stu@@ died com@@ para@@ tive physi@@ o@@ logy and evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary bio@@ logy as an under@@ gra@@ d — I had even w@@ rit@@ ten my sen@@ i@@ or the@@ sis on D@@ ar@@ win@@ ian theor@@ y — learning about the sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant over@@ la@@ p between the dis@@ or@@ ders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed w@@ ak@@ e-@@ up call for me ."
"For that matter , why was any of this a surpris@@ e ?"
"I mean , look , every single physi@@ ci@@ an ac@@ cep@@ ts some bi@@ olog@@ ical conne@@ ction between animals and humans ."
"Now , maybe some of the surpris@@ e comes from the incre@@ as@@ ing se@@ par@@ ation in our world between the ur@@ ban and the non@@ ur@@ ban ."
"You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wo@@ ol gro@@ ws on tre@@ es or that che@@ ese comes from a pl@@ ant ."
"Well , today &apos;s human hos@@ p@@ it@@ als , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly , are tur@@ ning into these g@@ le@@ am@@ ing ca@@ the@@ d@@ r@@ als of technology ."
But I think there &apos;s an even de@@ ep@@ er reason .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans and scientists , we ac@@ cept intel@@ le@@ c@@ tually that our species , H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , is mer@@ ely one species , no more uni@@ qu@@ e or speci@@ al than any other ."
"But in our hear@@ ts , we don &apos;t completely believe that ."
I feel it myself when I &apos;m lis@@ ten@@ ing to Mo@@ z@@ art or looking at pic@@ tures of the Mar@@ s R@@ over on my M@@ ac@@ Bo@@ ok .
"I feel that tu@@ g of human ex@@ cep@@ tion@@ alis@@ m , even as I reco@@ gn@@ ize the scienti@@ fic@@ ally is@@ ol@@ ating cost of seeing ourselves as a su@@ peri@@ or species , ap@@ art ."
"Well , I &apos;m trying these days ."
"And , might I be taking better care of my human pati@@ ent if I saw them as a human anima@@ l pati@@ ent ?"
Here are a few exam@@ ples of the kind of exci@@ ting conne@@ ctions that this kind of thinking has led me to .
F@@ ear@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed heart fa@@ il@@ u@@ re .
How many human lives might have been sav@@ ed if this ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary knowledge had been put into the hands of E@@ .@@ R@@ . do@@ cs and car@@ dio@@ logis@@ ts ?
S@@ el@@ f-@@ in@@ ju@@ ry .
S@@ ome human pati@@ ents har@@ m themselves .
"S@@ ome pl@@ uc@@ k out pa@@ t@@ ches of h@@ air , others actually c@@ ut themselves ."
There are bir@@ ds that pl@@ uc@@ k out fe@@ ath@@ ers .
There are st@@ alli@@ ons that re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tively b@@ ite their f@@ lan@@ ks until they b@@ le@@ ed .
P@@ os@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pres@@ sion and po@@ st@@ par@@ tu@@ m psy@@ ch@@ osis .
"S@@ ome@@ times , so@@ on after giving bir@@ th , some women become de@@ pres@@ sed , and sometimes they become ser@@ i@@ ously de@@ pres@@ sed and even psy@@ ch@@ oti@@ c ."
"They may ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct their ne@@ w@@ born , and in some extre@@ me cas@@ es , even har@@ m the child ."
"E@@ qu@@ ine ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans also know that oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally , a m@@ are , so@@ on after giving bir@@ th , will ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct the fo@@ al , re@@ fus@@ ing to n@@ ur@@ se , and in some in@@ stan@@ ces , k@@ ic@@ k the fo@@ al , even to death ."
But ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have de@@ vis@@ ed an inter@@ ven@@ tion to deal with this fo@@ al re@@ je@@ ction syn@@ dro@@ me that invol@@ ves incre@@ as@@ ing ox@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in in the m@@ are .
"O@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in is the b@@ on@@ ding hor@@ m@@ one , and this lead@@ s to ren@@ e@@ wed inter@@ est , on the part of the m@@ are , in her fo@@ al ."
S@@ h@@ ouldn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of o@@ b / gy@@ n &apos;s and family doc@@ tors and pati@@ ents who are str@@ ug@@ g@@ ling with po@@ st@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pres@@ sion and psy@@ ch@@ osis ?
S@@ ome physi@@ ci@@ ans can be real s@@ no@@ bs about doc@@ tors who are not M@@ .@@ D@@ . &apos; s .
"O@@ f course , most physi@@ ci@@ ans don &apos;t realize that it is har@@ der to get into ve@@ t school these days than medi@@ cal school , and that when we go to medi@@ cal school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , but ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans need to learn about health and disease in ma@@ m@@ m@@ als , am@@ ph@@ i@@ bi@@ ans , re@@ p@@ ti@@ les , fish and bir@@ ds ."
So I don &apos;t bl@@ ame the ve@@ ts for feel@@ ing an@@ noy@@ ed by my pro@@ fes@@ sion &apos;s con@@ des@@ cen@@ sion and ig@@ nor@@ ance .
But here &apos;s one from the ve@@ ts : What do you call a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an who can only take care of one species ?
"And through Z@@ o@@ o@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity con@@ fer@@ ences , where we bring medi@@ cal scho@@ ols together with ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary scho@@ ols for col@@ lab@@ or@@ tive dis@@ cus@@ sions of the shar@@ ed dis@@ eas@@ es and dis@@ or@@ ders of anima@@ l and human pati@@ ents ."
"Because it turns out , some of the best and most human@@ is@@ tic me@@ dic@@ ine is being prac@@ tic@@ ed by doc@@ tors wh@@ ose pati@@ ents ar@@ en &apos;t human ."
Thank you .
C@@ an ge@@ og@@ rap@@ hi@@ c information make you heal@@ th@@ y ?
In 200@@ 1 I got h@@ it by a tra@@ in .
My tra@@ in was a heart atta@@ ck .
"I found myself in a hos@@ p@@ ital in an in@@ ten@@ si@@ ve@@ -@@ care ward , re@@ cu@@ per@@ ating from e@@ mer@@ gen@@ cy sur@@ ger@@ y ."
And I su@@ d@@ den@@ ly realized something : that I was completely in the dar@@ k .
"I started as@@ king my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;"
&quot; C@@ ould my doc@@ tor have war@@ ned me ? &quot;
"So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the for@@ mu@@ la for life and good health ."
"G@@ en@@ e@@ tics , li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le and environment ."
"That &apos;s going to sort of con@@ tain our ris@@ ks , and if we man@@ age those ris@@ ks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good heal@@ th@@ y life ."
"Well , I understand the gene@@ tics and li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le part ."
And you know why I understand that ?
Because my physi@@ ci@@ ans con@@ stan@@ tly ask me questions about this .
"H@@ ave you ever had to f@@ ill out those long , le@@ gal@@ -@@ size for@@ ms in your doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice ?"
"I mean , if you &apos;re l@@ uc@@ k@@ y enough you get to do it more than once , right ?"
"( Laughter ) D@@ o it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le and your family history , your me@@ dic@@ ation history , your sur@@ g@@ ical history , your all@@ erg@@ y history ... did I for@@ get any history ?"
"But this part of the equ@@ ation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physi@@ ci@@ ans really get this part of the equ@@ ation ."
"What does that mean , my environment ?"
"Well , it can mean a lot of things ."
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
Wh@@ ile I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you li@@ ved ?
"@@ Just think about that , you know , wan@@ der through your life thinking about this ."
And you realize that you spend it in a vari@@ e@@ ty of different places .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
"And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an air@@ plan@@ e a good por@@ tion of your time tra@@ vel@@ ing some place ."
"So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody as@@ ks you , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?"
"And where do you ex@@ pose y@@ ourselves to ris@@ ks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the con@@ clu@@ sion that I spend about 7@@ 5 percent of my time rela@@ tively in a small number of places ."
"And I don &apos;t wan@@ der far from that place for a maj@@ or@@ ity of my time , even though I &apos;m an ex@@ ten@@ sive global tre@@ k@@ ker ."
"Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little jour@@ ney here ."
"I started off in S@@ c@@ ran@@ ton , P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia ."
"I don &apos;t know if any@@ body might h@@ ai@@ l from nor@@ the@@ as@@ ter@@ n P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , but this is where I spent my first 1@@ 9 years with my little young l@@ un@@ gs ."
"You know , bre@@ a@@ thing high con@@ cen@@ tra@@ tions here of sul@@ fu@@ r dio@@ xi@@ de , car@@ b@@ on dio@@ xi@@ de and me@@ than@@ e g@@ as , in u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al qu@@ anti@@ ties — 1@@ 9 years of this ."
"And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those p@@ il@@ es of bur@@ ning , s@@ mo@@ l@@ der@@ ing co@@ al was@@ te look like ."
"So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mi@@ d-@@ w@@ est ."
"O@@ K , so I en@@ ded up in L@@ ou@@ is@@ v@@ il@@ le , Ken@@ tu@@ ck@@ y ."
"Well , I decided to be n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ s to a place called R@@ u@@ b@@ ber@@ to@@ wn ."
They man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture plas@@ tics . They use large qu@@ anti@@ ties ch@@ lo@@ ro@@ p@@ ren@@ e and ben@@ z@@ en@@ e .
"O@@ kay , I spent 25 years , in my midd@@ le@@ -@@ age l@@ un@@ gs now , bre@@ a@@ thing vari@@ ous con@@ cen@@ tra@@ tions of that ."
"And on a cle@@ ar day it always looked like this , so you never saw it ."
It was in@@ si@@ di@@ ous and it was really happening .
"Th@@ en I decided I had to get really smar@@ t , I would take this job in the W@@ est C@@ o@@ ast ."
And I mo@@ ved to R@@ ed@@ lan@@ ds C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia .
"V@@ er@@ y n@@ ice , and there my ol@@ der , sen@@ i@@ or l@@ un@@ gs , as I like to call them , I fil@@ led with particu@@ late matter , car@@ b@@ on dio@@ xi@@ de and very high dos@@ es of o@@ z@@ one ."
Okay ? Al@@ most like the high@@ est in the n@@ ation .
"A@@ l@@ right , this is what it looks like on a good day ."
"If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about ."
"So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?"
"Well , the picture is , there is a huge g@@ ap here ."
The one thing that never happens in my doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice : They never ask me about my place history .
"N@@ o doc@@ tor , can I remember , ever as@@ king me , &quot; Wh@@ ere have you li@@ ved ? &quot;"
They ha@@ ven &apos;t asked me what kind of the qu@@ ality of the d@@ rin@@ king water that I put in my m@@ outh or the food that I ing@@ est into my sto@@ ma@@ ch .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s m@@ iss@@ ing .
Lo@@ ok at the kind of data that &apos;s av@@ ail@@ able .
This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend bil@@ lions of dollars inv@@ es@@ ting in this kind of research .
"Now , I &apos;ve cir@@ c@@ led the places where I &apos;ve been ."
"Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart atta@@ ck I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?"
"So , how many people are in the wh@@ ite ?"
How many people in the room have spent the maj@@ or@@ ity of their life in the wh@@ ite space ?
An@@ y@@ body ? B@@ oy you &apos;re l@@ uc@@ k@@ y .
How many have spent it in the red places ?
"O@@ h , not so l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ."
There are thousands of these kinds of ma@@ ps that are dis@@ play@@ ed in at@@ las@@ es all over the world .
They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our tra@@ in w@@ re@@ ck .
But n@@ one of that &apos;s in my medi@@ cal recor@@ d .
And it &apos;s not in y@@ ours either .
"So , here &apos;s my friend P@@ au@@ l ."
"He &apos;s a colle@@ ag@@ ue . He allo@@ wed his cell phone to be tra@@ c@@ ked every two hours , 2@@ 4 / 7 , 3@@ 6@@ 5 days out of the year for the last two years , every@@ where he went ."
And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
And this is where he has spent most of his time .
If you really stu@@ died that you might have some clu@@ es as to what P@@ au@@ l lik@@ es to do .
An@@ y@@ body got any clu@@ es ? S@@ ki . Right .
"We can zo@@ om in here , and we su@@ d@@ den@@ ly see that now we see where P@@ au@@ l has really spent a maj@@ or@@ ity of his time ."
And all of those black d@@ ots are all of the to@@ x@@ ic rele@@ ase inven@@ to@@ ries that are mon@@ i@@ to@@ red by the E@@ P@@ A .
Di@@ d you know that data exis@@ ted ?
"For every community in the United States , you could have your own person@@ al@@ ized ma@@ p of that ."
"So , our cell ph@@ ones can now build a place history ."
This is how P@@ au@@ l did it . He did it with his iP@@ h@@ one .
This might be what we end up with .
This is what the physi@@ ci@@ an would have in front of him and her when we en@@ ter that ex@@ am room instead of just the pin@@ k sli@@ p that said I pai@@ d at the coun@@ ter . Right ?
This could be my little as@@ se@@ ss@@ ment .
"And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ho@@ a B@@ ill , I sug@@ gest that maybe you not deci@@ de , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia , and it &apos;s war@@ m every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck at night ."
"I &apos;d sug@@ gest that that &apos;s a bad idea B@@ ill , because of this re@@ port . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions ."
"O@@ kay , number one is , we must te@@ ach physi@@ ci@@ ans about the val@@ ue of ge@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ical information ."
It &apos;s called ge@@ ome@@ dic@@ ine . There are about a half a do@@ z@@ en progra@@ ms in the world right now that are focu@@ sed on this .
And they &apos;re in the early sta@@ ges of develo@@ pment .
"Th@@ ese progra@@ ms need to be sup@@ por@@ ted , and we need to te@@ ach our future doc@@ tors of the world the impor@@ tance of some of the information I &apos;ve shar@@ ed here with you today ."
"The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re spen@@ ding bil@@ lions and bil@@ lions of dollars all over the world building an elec@@ tron@@ ic health recor@@ d , we make sure we put a place history inside that medi@@ cal recor@@ d ."
It not only will be important for the physi@@ ci@@ an ; it will be important for the rese@@ arch@@ ers that now will have huge s@@ am@@ ples to dra@@ w upo@@ n .
But it will also be u@@ se@@ ful for us .
"I could have made the decis@@ ion , if I had this information , not to move to the o@@ z@@ one cap@@ ital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that decis@@ ion ."
O@@ r I could ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate with my em@@ ploy@@ er to make that decis@@ ion in the best inter@@ est of myself and my company .
"W@@ ith that , I would like to just say that J@@ ack L@@ or@@ d said this almost 10 years ago ."
Just look at that for a minu@@ te .
"That was what the con@@ clu@@ sion of the D@@ ar@@ t@@ m@@ outh A@@ t@@ l@@ as of H@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ care was about , was saying that we can expl@@ ain the ge@@ og@@ rap@@ hi@@ c vari@@ ations that oc@@ cu@@ r in disease , in ill@@ ness , in wel@@ l@@ ness , and how our heal@@ th@@ care system actually oper@@ ates ."
That was what he was talking about on that quot@@ e .
And I would say he got it right almost a dec@@ ad@@ e ago .
"So , I &apos;d very much like to see us beg@@ in to really sei@@ ze this as an opportunity to get this into our medi@@ cal recor@@ ds ."
"So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : G@@ e@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ y always mat@@ ters ."
And I believe that ge@@ og@@ rap@@ hi@@ c information can make both you and me very heal@@ th@@ y . Thank you .

"So I was tra@@ ined to become a gy@@ mn@@ ast for two years in H@@ un@@ an , China in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
"When I was in the first gra@@ de , the government wanted to trans@@ fer me to a school for ath@@ le@@ tes , all ex@@ pen@@ ses pai@@ d ."

It is not important if I like the job or not .

That is me pla@@ ying my ima@@ gin@@ ary pi@@ ano .
"An oper@@ a sing@@ er must start tra@@ in@@ ing young to learn ac@@ ro@@ ba@@ tics , so I tried everything I could to go to oper@@ a school ."
I even w@@ ro@@ te to the school prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al and the hos@@ t of a ra@@ dio show .
But no ad@@ ul@@ ts lik@@ ed the idea .
No ad@@ ul@@ ts beli@@ ev@@ ed I was ser@@ i@@ ous .
"O@@ n@@ ly my friends sup@@ por@@ ted me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was ."
"So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be tra@@ ined ."
My dre@@ am would never come true .
I was af@@ ra@@ id that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s hap@@ pin@@ ess would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so un@@ fai@@ r .
So I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to find another c@@ all@@ ing .
No@@ body around to te@@ ach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to books .
I sa@@ tis@@ fi@@ ed my hun@@ ger for par@@ en@@ tal ad@@ v@@ ice from this book by a family of w@@ rit@@ ers and mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ or@@ respon@@ dence in the F@@ a@@ mi@@ ly of F@@ ou L@@ ei &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my ro@@ le model of an in@@ depen@@ dent woman when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an tradi@@ tion re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es o@@ be@@ dience . &#91; &quot; &quot; J@@ ane E@@ y@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be ef@@ fici@@ ent from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er by the D@@ o@@ z@@ en &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspi@@ red to study ab@@ ro@@ ad after read@@ ing these .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ om@@ ple@@ te Wor@@ ks of S@@ an@@ ma@@ o &quot; &quot; ( aka E@@ cho Ch@@ an ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ es@@ s@@ ons F@@ ro@@ m H@@ is@@ tory &quot; &quot; by N@@ an H@@ u@@ ai@@ j@@ in &#93; I came to the U.S. in 199@@ 5 , so which books did I read here first ?"
"B@@ o@@ o@@ ks ban@@ ned in China , of course ."
&quot; &quot; The Go@@ od Earth &quot; &quot; is about Ch@@ in@@ ese pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent for pro@@ pag@@ an@@ da . Go@@ t it .
"The B@@ i@@ ble is interesting , but str@@ an@@ ge ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a to@@ pi@@ c for a different day .
But the fi@@ f@@ th com@@ man@@ d@@ ment gave me an epi@@ ph@@ any : &quot; You sh@@ all hon@@ or your father and mother . &quot;
"&quot; &quot; H@@ on@@ or , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than o@@ be@@ y . &quot; &quot; So it be@@ comes my to@@ ol to cli@@ m@@ b out of this Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an gu@@ il@@ t tra@@ p and to re@@ start my relation@@ ship with my parents ."
En@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing a new culture also started my ha@@ bit of com@@ para@@ tive read@@ ing .

"It had never oc@@ cur@@ red to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the cen@@ ter of the world ."
A ma@@ p actually car@@ ries somebody &apos;s view .
C@@ om@@ para@@ tive read@@ ing actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a stan@@ d@@ ard prac@@ tice in the ac@@ ade@@ mic world .

C@@ om@@ par@@ e and con@@ tr@@ ast gi@@ ves sch@@ ol@@ ars a more comple@@ te under@@ standing of a to@@ pi@@ c .
"So I thought , well , if com@@ para@@ tive read@@ ing works for research , why not do it in dai@@ ly life too ?"
So I started read@@ ing books in pair@@ s .
"So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in Fran@@ kl@@ in &quot; &quot; by W@@ al@@ ter I@@ sa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ h@@ n A@@ d@@ am@@ s &quot; &quot; by D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ c@@ C@@ ul@@ l@@ ough &#93; — who are invol@@ ved in the same ev@@ ent , or friends with shar@@ ed experi@@ ences ."

"For the B@@ u@@ dd@@ h@@ a , they are all psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ical : l@@ ust , fe@@ ar and social du@@ ty — interesting ."
"So if you know a for@@ ei@@ g@@ n language , it &apos;s also fu@@ n to read your fav@@ or@@ ite books in two langu@@ ages ."

"I &apos;m an American , which means , gener@@ ally , I ig@@ nor@@ e fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all un@@ less it invol@@ ves guys my size or B@@ run@@ o &apos;s size run@@ ning into each other at extre@@ me@@ ly high spe@@ e@@ ds ."
"That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ig@@ nor@@ e fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all for the last couple of we@@ eks ."
"I go on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , there are all these str@@ an@@ ge words that I &apos;ve never heard before : F@@ I@@ F@@ A , v@@ u@@ v@@ u@@ z@@ el@@ a , w@@ ei@@ r@@ d jo@@ kes about oc@@ to@@ pi ."

It &apos;s been a maj@@ or tr@@ en@@ ding to@@ pi@@ c .
"B@@ e@@ ing a mon@@ ol@@ in@@ gu@@ al American , I obvi@@ ously don &apos;t know what the ph@@ ras@@ e means ."
"So I went on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , and I asked some people if they could expl@@ ain to me &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And for@@ tu@@ na@@ tely , my Bra@@ zi@@ li@@ an friends were more than ready to help ."
"They expl@@ ain@@ ed that the G@@ al@@ va@@ o b@@ ird is a r@@ are and en@@ dang@@ er@@ ed par@@ ro@@ t that &apos;s in terri@@ ble , terri@@ ble dang@@ er ."
"In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it ."
"N@@ ar@@ ra@@ tor : A word about G@@ al@@ va@@ o , a very r@@ are kind of b@@ ird na@@ tive to Bra@@ zi@@ l ."
"E@@ very year , more than 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 G@@ al@@ va@@ o bir@@ ds are kil@@ led during C@@ ar@@ ni@@ v@@ al par@@ ades ."
"E@@ than Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ man : O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , this is a tra@@ gic sit@@ u@@ ation , and it actually gets wor@@ se ."
"It turns out that , not only is the G@@ al@@ va@@ o par@@ ro@@ t very at@@ tra@@ ctive , u@@ se@@ ful for head@@ dre@@ s@@ ses , it evi@@ den@@ tly has certain h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic pro@@ per@@ ties , which means that there &apos;s a terri@@ ble problem with G@@ al@@ va@@ o ab@@ use ."
S@@ ome si@@ ck and tw@@ is@@ ted people have found themselves s@@ nor@@ ting G@@ al@@ va@@ o .
And it &apos;s terri@@ bly en@@ dang@@ er@@ ed .
"The good news about this is that the global community — again , my Bra@@ zi@@ li@@ an friends tell me — is p@@ it@@ ching in to help out ."
"It turns out that L@@ ad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a has rele@@ as@@ ed a new single — actually five or six new sing@@ les , as ne@@ ar as I can tell — ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And my Bra@@ zi@@ li@@ an friends tell me that if I just twe@@ et the ph@@ ras@@ e &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o , &quot; &quot; 10 cen@@ ts will be given to a global cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n to sa@@ ve this r@@ are and beautiful b@@ ird ."
"Now , most of you have figu@@ red out that this was a p@@ ran@@ k , and actually a very , very good one ."
"&quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o &quot; &quot; actually means something very different ."
"In P@@ or@@ tu@@ ge@@ se , it means &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ut your m@@ outh , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And it speci@@ fic@@ ally re@@ fer@@ s to this guy , G@@ al@@ va@@ o B@@ u@@ eno , who &apos;s the le@@ ad so@@ c@@ cer com@@ men@@ ta@@ tor for Re@@ de G@@ lo@@ b@@ o ."
And what I understand from my Bra@@ zi@@ li@@ an friends is that this guy is just a cli@@ ch@@ e machine .
He can ru@@ in the most interesting mat@@ ch by just spo@@ u@@ ting cli@@ ch@@ e again and again and again .
"So Bra@@ zi@@ li@@ ans went to that first mat@@ ch against Nor@@ th Kor@@ ea , put up this ban@@ ner , started a T@@ wit@@ ter cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n and tried to con@@ vin@@ ce the rest of us to twe@@ et the ph@@ ras@@ e : &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so suc@@ cess@@ ful at this that it top@@ ped T@@ wit@@ ter for two we@@ eks ."
Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of le@@ ss@@ ons that you can take from this .
"And the first le@@ s@@ son , which I think is a wor@@ th@@ while one , is that you cannot go wrong as@@ king people to be ac@@ tive on@@ line , so long as ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m just means re@@ twe@@ e@@ ting a ph@@ ras@@ e ."
"So as long as ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with ."
"The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of Bra@@ zi@@ li@@ ans on T@@ wit@@ ter ."
There &apos;s more than five million of them .
"As far as national re@@ presen@@ tation , 11 percent of Bra@@ zi@@ li@@ an inter@@ net us@@ ers are on T@@ wit@@ ter ."
That &apos;s a much high@@ er number than in the U.S. or U.@@ K@@ .
"N@@ ex@@ t to J@@ ap@@ an , it &apos;s the second most re@@ presen@@ ted by population ."
"Now if you &apos;re using T@@ wit@@ ter or other social net@@ works , and you didn &apos;t realize this was a space with a lot of Bra@@ zi@@ li@@ ans in it , you &apos;re like most of us ."
Because what happens on a social net@@ work is you inter@@ act with the people that you have cho@@ se@@ n to inter@@ act with .
"And if you are like me , a big , ge@@ ek@@ y , wh@@ ite , American guy , you ten@@ d to inter@@ act with a lot of other ge@@ ek@@ y , wh@@ ite , American guys ."
And you don &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly have the sense that T@@ wit@@ ter is in fact a very he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly Bra@@ zi@@ li@@ an space .
"It &apos;s also extre@@ me@@ ly surpris@@ ing to many Americ@@ ans , a he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American space ."
T@@ wit@@ ter re@@ cen@@ tly did some research .
They looked at their local population .
They believe that 2@@ 4 percent of American T@@ wit@@ ter us@@ ers are Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American .
That &apos;s about tw@@ ice as high as Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Americ@@ ans are re@@ presen@@ ted in the population .
"And again , that was very sho@@ c@@ king to many T@@ wit@@ ter us@@ ers , but it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be ."
And the reason it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into T@@ ren@@ ding T@@ o@@ pic@@ s .
And you ten@@ d to find to@@ pic@@ s that are almost enti@@ re@@ ly Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions .
"This was a vis@@ u@@ al@@ ization done by F@@ er@@ n@@ an@@ do Vi@@ eg@@ as and Mar@@ tin W@@ atten@@ ber@@ g , two amazing vis@@ u@@ al@@ ization desig@@ ners , who looked at a we@@ ek@@ end &apos;s wor@@ th of T@@ wit@@ ter tra@@ f@@ fic and es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally found that a lot of these tr@@ en@@ ding to@@ pic@@ s were basically se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expe@@ ct ."
"It turns out that o@@ il sp@@ ill is a mo@@ st@@ ly wh@@ ite con@@ vers@@ ation , that co@@ ok@@ out is a mo@@ st@@ ly black con@@ vers@@ ation ."
"And what &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y about this is that if you wanted to mi@@ x up who you were seeing on T@@ wit@@ ter , it &apos;s liter@@ ally a quic@@ k cli@@ ck away ."
"You cli@@ ck on that co@@ ok@@ out ta@@ g , there an enti@@ re@@ ly different con@@ vers@@ ation with different people parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ting in it ."
"But gener@@ ally spe@@ aking , most of us don &apos;t ."
"We end up within these fil@@ ter bu@@ b@@ b@@ les , as my friend E@@ li Par@@ is@@ er c@@ alls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are si@@ mil@@ ar to the people we already know ."
And we ten@@ d not to see that w@@ ide@@ r picture .
"Now for me , I &apos;m surpris@@ ed by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the inter@@ net was sup@@ posed to be ."
"If you go back into the early days of the inter@@ net , when cy@@ ber@@ -@@ u@@ to@@ pi@@ ans like N@@ ic@@ k N@@ eg@@ ro@@ pon@@ te were wri@@ ting big books like &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing D@@ ig@@ ital , &quot; &quot; the pre@@ di@@ ction was that the inter@@ net was going to be an incredi@@ bly powerful for@@ ce to s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h out cul@@ tural differ@@ ences , to put us all on a common field of one fas@@ h@@ ion or another ."
N@@ eg@@ ro@@ pon@@ te started his book with a story about how hard it is to build conne@@ ctions in the world of ato@@ ms .
He &apos;s at a technology con@@ fer@@ ence in F@@ l@@ or@@ ida .
"And he &apos;s looking at something really , tru@@ ly ab@@ sur@@ d , which is bot@@ t@@ les of E@@ vi@@ an water on the table ."
And N@@ eg@@ ro@@ pon@@ te says this is cra@@ z@@ y .
This is the old economy .
"It &apos;s the economy of moving these he@@ av@@ y , s@@ low ato@@ ms over long dis@@ tan@@ ces that &apos;s very difficult to do ."
"We &apos;re head@@ ing to the future of b@@ its , where everything is spe@@ e@@ dy , it &apos;s w@@ eigh@@ t@@ less ."
It can be any@@ where in the world at any time .
And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
"Now , N@@ eg@@ ro@@ pon@@ te has been right about a lot of things ."
He &apos;s to@@ tally wrong about this one .
It turns out that in many cas@@ es ato@@ ms are much more mo@@ bil@@ e than b@@ its .
"If I walk into a sto@@ re in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to bu@@ y water that &apos;s bot@@ t@@ led in F@@ i@@ j@@ i , shi@@ pped at great ex@@ pen@@ se to the United States ."
It &apos;s actually surpris@@ ing@@ ly hard for me to see a F@@ i@@ j@@ ian fe@@ a@@ ture film .
It &apos;s really difficult for me to lis@@ ten to F@@ i@@ j@@ ian music .
"It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly difficult for me to get F@@ i@@ j@@ ian news , which is str@@ an@@ ge , because actually there &apos;s an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount going on in F@@ i@@ j@@ i ."
There &apos;s a cou@@ p government . There &apos;s a mil@@ it@@ ary government .
There &apos;s cra@@ ck@@ do@@ w@@ ns on the pre@@ ss .
It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be pa@@ ying atten@@ tion to at the moment .
Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
I think that we ten@@ d to look a lot at the in@@ fras@@ tr@@ uc@@ ture of glo@@ bal@@ ization .
We look at the fra@@ me@@ work that makes it possible to live in this conne@@ cted world .
And that &apos;s a fra@@ me@@ work that inclu@@ des things like air@@ line ro@@ u@@ tes .
It inclu@@ des things like the Internet c@@ ab@@ les .
"We look at a ma@@ p like this one , and it looks like the entire world is fl@@ at because everything is a ho@@ p or two away ."
"You can get on a f@@ light in Lon@@ don , you can end up in B@@ an@@ gal@@ ore later today ."
"T@@ w@@ o ho@@ ps , you &apos;re in Su@@ va , the cap@@ i@@ to@@ l of F@@ i@@ j@@ i ."
It &apos;s all right there .
"When you start looking at what actually flo@@ ws on top of these net@@ works , you get a very different picture ."
"You start looking at how the global plan@@ e fli@@ ghts move , and you su@@ d@@ den@@ ly disco@@ ver that the world isn &apos;t even close to fl@@ at ."
It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly lu@@ m@@ py .
"There are parts of the world that are very , very well conne@@ cted ."
There &apos;s basically a gi@@ ant path@@ way in the sk@@ y between Lon@@ don and New York .
"@@ but look at this ma@@ p , and you can wat@@ ch this for , you know , two or three minutes ."
You won &apos;t see very many plan@@ es go from S@@ outh America to Africa .
And you &apos;ll disco@@ ver that there are parts of the glo@@ be that are syste@@ mati@@ cally c@@ ut off .
"When we stop looking at the in@@ fras@@ tr@@ uc@@ ture that makes conne@@ ction possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start real@@ iz@@ ing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does ."
So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last dec@@ ad@@ e or so .
"The world is , in fact , getting more global ."
It &apos;s getting more conne@@ cted .
M@@ ore of problems are global in scale .
M@@ ore of our econom@@ ics is global in scale .
And our media is less global by the day .
"If you wat@@ ched a tele@@ vision bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast in the United States in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , 3@@ 5 to 40 percent of it would have been inter@@ national news on a ni@@ gh@@ tly new bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast ."
That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
And this ten@@ ds to give us a very dis@@ tor@@ ted view of the world .
Here &apos;s a sli@@ de that A@@ lis@@ a Mil@@ ler sho@@ wed at a pre@@ vi@@ ous TED T@@ al@@ k .
A@@ lis@@ a &apos;s the pre@@ si@@ dent of P@@ u@@ b@@ lic R@@ a@@ dio In@@ ter@@ national .
"And she made a car@@ to@@ gra@@ m , which is basically a dis@@ tor@@ ted ma@@ p based on what American tele@@ vision news cas@@ ts looked at for a mon@@ th ."
"And you see that when you dis@@ tor@@ t a ma@@ p based on atten@@ tion , the world within American tele@@ vision news is basically re@@ duc@@ ed to this gi@@ ant blo@@ ated U.S@@ ."
and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve in@@ va@@ ded .
And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
"And before you con@@ clu@@ de that this is just a fun@@ ction of American T@@ V news — which is dre@@ ad@@ ful , and I ag@@ ree that it &apos;s dre@@ ad@@ ful — I &apos;ve been ma@@ p@@ ping el@@ ite media like the New York T@@ imes , and I get the same thing ."
"When you look at the New York T@@ imes , you look at other el@@ ite media , what you lar@@ ge@@ ly get are pic@@ tures of very we@@ al@@ th@@ y na@@ tions and the na@@ tions we &apos;ve in@@ va@@ ded ."
It turns out that new media isn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly hel@@ ping us all that much .
Here &apos;s a ma@@ p made by Mar@@ k G@@ ra@@ ha@@ m who &apos;s down the stre@@ et at the O@@ x@@ for@@ d Internet In@@ stitu@@ te .
A this is a ma@@ p of ar@@ tic@@ les in W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia that have been ge@@ o-@@ co@@ ded .
And you &apos;ll no@@ tice that there &apos;s a very he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ wards Nor@@ th America and W@@ ester@@ n Euro@@ pe .
"E@@ ven within W@@ iki@@ pe@@ di@@ as , where we &apos;re cre@@ ating their own con@@ tent on@@ line , there &apos;s a he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ wards the place where a lot of the W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia au@@ th@@ ors are based , rather than to the rest of the world ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , you can get up , you can pi@@ ck up your computer when you get out of this se@@ s@@ sion , you could read a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er from India or from Aus@@ tr@@ alia , from C@@ an@@ ada , God for@@ bi@@ d from the U.S@@ ."
You probably won &apos;t .
"If you look at on@@ line media con@@ sum@@ ption — in this case , in the top 10 us@@ ers of the inter@@ net — more than 9@@ 5 percent of the news read@@ er@@ ship is on do@@ me@@ sti@@ c news s@@ ites ."
"It &apos;s one of these r@@ are cas@@ es where the U.S. is actually sli@@ gh@@ tly better than &#91; the U.@@ K@@ . &#93; , because we actually like read@@ ing your media , rather than v@@ ice ver@@ sa ."
So all of this star@@ ts lead@@ ing me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I re@@ fer to as ima@@ gin@@ ary cos@@ mo@@ pol@@ it@@ anis@@ m .
We look at the inter@@ net .
We think we &apos;re getting this wi@@ de view of the glo@@ be .
"We oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally stu@@ m@@ ble on@@ to a p@@ age in Ch@@ in@@ ese , and we deci@@ de that we do in fact have the gre@@ a@@ test technology ever built to conne@@ ct us to the rest of the world ."
And we for@@ get that most of the time we &apos;re che@@ c@@ king B@@ os@@ ton R@@ ed So@@ x s@@ cor@@ es .
"So this is a real problem — not just because the R@@ ed So@@ x are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re dis@@ cus@@ sing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and s@@ co@@ pe , they re@@ qui@@ re global con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions to get to global solu@@ tions ."
This is a problem we have to solve .
So here &apos;s the good news .
"For six years , I &apos;ve been h@@ ang@@ ing out with these guys ."
This is a group called G@@ lo@@ bal V@@ o@@ ices .
This is a team of b@@ log@@ g@@ ers from around the world .
O@@ ur mis@@ sion was to fi@@ x the world &apos;s media .
We started in 200@@ 4 .
"You might have no@@ tic@@ ed , we ha@@ ven &apos;t done all that well so far ."
"N@@ or do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem ."
"But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting le@@ ss@@ ons for how we would re@@ wi@@ re if we we wanted to use the we@@ b to have a w@@ ide@@ r world ."
The first thing you have to consi@@ der is that there are parts of the world that are dar@@ k spo@@ ts in terms of atten@@ tion .
In this case — the ma@@ p of the world at night by N@@ A@@ SA — they &apos;re dar@@ k liter@@ ally because of l@@ ack of electri@@ city .
And I used to think that a dar@@ k spo@@ t on this ma@@ p basically me@@ ant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more bas@@ ic needs .
"What I &apos;m star@@ ting to realize is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of work , and you need an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ment ."
"One of those dar@@ k spo@@ ts is M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ car , a country which is gener@@ ally better known for the D@@ re@@ am@@ works film than it is actually known for the lo@@ vely people who live there ."
And so the people who f@@ oun@@ ded F@@ o@@ ko C@@ lu@@ b in M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ car wer@@ en &apos;t actually con@@ cer@@ ned with trying to change the image of their country .
They were doing something much sim@@ ple@@ r .
It was a clu@@ b to learn Eng@@ lish and to learn compu@@ ters and the inter@@ net .
but what happened was that M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ car went through a viol@@ ent cou@@ p .
M@@ os@@ t in@@ depen@@ dent media was sh@@ ut down .
"And the high school students who were learning to blo@@ g through F@@ o@@ ko C@@ lu@@ b su@@ d@@ den@@ ly found themselves talking to an inter@@ national au@@ dience about the de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tions , the violence , everything that was going on within this country ."
"So a very , very small program desig@@ ned to get people in front of compu@@ ters , pub@@ lis@@ hing their own thou@@ ghts , pub@@ lis@@ hing in@@ depen@@ dent media , en@@ ded up having a huge imp@@ act on what we know about this country ."
Now the tri@@ ck with this is that I &apos;m gu@@ es@@ sing most people here don &apos;t speak M@@ al@@ ag@@ as@@ y .
"I &apos;m also gu@@ es@@ sing that most of you don &apos;t even speak Ch@@ in@@ ese — which is sort of s@@ ad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most re@@ presen@@ ted language on the inter@@ net ."
For@@ tu@@ na@@ tely people are trying to figure out how to fi@@ x this .
"If you &apos;re using Google Ch@@ ro@@ me and you go to a Ch@@ in@@ ese language s@@ ite , you no@@ tice this really cu@@ te box at the top , which auto@@ mati@@ cally de@@ te@@ cts that the p@@ age is in Ch@@ in@@ ese and very quickly at a m@@ ouse cli@@ ck will give you a trans@@ lation of the p@@ age ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ na@@ tely , it &apos;s a machine trans@@ lation of the p@@ age ."
"And while Google is very , very good with some langu@@ ages , it &apos;s actually pretty dre@@ ad@@ ful with Ch@@ in@@ ese ."
And the resul@@ ts can be pretty fun@@ n@@ y .
"What you really want — what I really want , is ev@@ en@@ tually the ability to pus@@ h a bu@@ t@@ ton and have this qu@@ eu@@ ed so a human being can trans@@ late this ."
"And if you think this is ab@@ sur@@ d , it &apos;s not ."
There &apos;s a group right now in China called Ye@@ ey@@ an .
"And Ye@@ ey@@ an is a group of 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers who get on@@ line every day ."
They look for the most interesting con@@ tent in the Eng@@ lish language .
"They trans@@ late ro@@ ugh@@ ly 100 ar@@ tic@@ les a day from maj@@ or ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers , maj@@ or w@@ eb@@ s@@ ites ."
They put it on@@ line for free .
"It &apos;s the project of a guy na@@ med Z@@ h@@ an@@ g L@@ ei , who was living in the United States during the L@@ h@@ as@@ a ri@@ ots and who couldn &apos;t believe how bi@@ as@@ ed American media co@@ verage was ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start trans@@ la@@ ting , so that people between these countries start under@@ standing each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Ye@@ ey@@ an can line up 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 people to trans@@ late the Eng@@ lish inter@@ net into Ch@@ in@@ ese , where &apos;s the Eng@@ lish language Ye@@ ey@@ an ?"
"Wh@@ o &apos;s going after Ch@@ in@@ ese , which now has 4@@ 00 million inter@@ net us@@ ers out there ?"
My gu@@ ess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
"So even if we can find a way to trans@@ late from Ch@@ in@@ ese , there &apos;s no gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e that we &apos;re going to find it ."
"When we look for information on@@ line , we basically have two stra@@ te@@ gies ."
We use a lot of se@@ arch .
And se@@ arch is terri@@ fic if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
"But if what you &apos;re looking for is ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity , if you want to stu@@ m@@ ble on@@ to something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our ma@@ in ph@@ i@@ loso@@ ph@@ y is to look to our social net@@ works , to look for our friends ."
What are they looking at ? M@@ ay@@ be we should be looking at it .
The problem with this is that es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally what you end up getting after a while is the w@@ is@@ dom of the flo@@ ck .
"You end up flo@@ c@@ king with a lot of people who are probably si@@ mil@@ ar to you , who have si@@ mil@@ ar interes@@ ts ."
"And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other flo@@ cks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interes@@ ts ."
"To do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bu@@ m@@ p you out of your flo@@ ck and into another flo@@ ck ."
You need a gu@@ i@@ de .
So this is A@@ mi@@ ra A@@ l H@@ us@@ s@@ ain@@ i . She is the M@@ id@@ d@@ le E@@ ast e@@ di@@ tor for G@@ lo@@ bal V@@ o@@ ices .
She has one of the har@@ de@@ st j@@ ob@@ s in the world .
"N@@ ot only does she have to keep our Isra@@ el@@ i and P@@ al@@ es@@ tin@@ ian con@@ tribu@@ tors from kil@@ ling each other , she has to figure out what is going to inter@@ est you about the M@@ id@@ d@@ le E@@ ast ."
"And in that sense of trying to get you out of your nor@@ mal or@@ bit , and to try to get you to p@@ ay atten@@ tion to a story about someone who &apos;s given up s@@ mo@@ king for the mon@@ th of R@@ a@@ ma@@ d@@ an , she has to know something about a global au@@ dience ."
She has to know something about what stories are av@@ ail@@ able .
"B@@ as@@ ically , she &apos;s a de@@ e@@ j@@ ay ."
"She &apos;s a sk@@ il@@ led human cu@@ ra@@ tor who kno@@ ws what materi@@ al is av@@ ail@@ able to her , who &apos;s able to lis@@ ten to the au@@ dience , and who &apos;s able to make a se@@ le@@ ction and pus@@ h people forward in one fas@@ h@@ ion or another ."
I don &apos;t think this is ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly an algorith@@ mic process .
I think what &apos;s great about the inter@@ net is that it actually makes it much eas@@ i@@ er for de@@ e@@ j@@ a@@ ys to re@@ ach a w@@ ide@@ r au@@ dience .
I know A@@ mi@@ ra .
I can ask her what to read .
"But with the inter@@ net , she &apos;s in a posi@@ tion where she can tell a lot of people what to read ."
"And you can lis@@ ten to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your we@@ b w@@ id@@ en@@ ed ."
"So once you start w@@ id@@ en@@ ing like this , once you start li@@ gh@@ ting up vo@@ ices in the dar@@ k spo@@ ts , once you start trans@@ la@@ ting , once you start cu@@ ra@@ ting , you end up in some really w@@ ei@@ r@@ d places ."
"This is an image from pretty much my fav@@ or@@ ite blo@@ g , which is Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get ."
And Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get is a blo@@ g that looks at technology in an Africa con@@ text .
"And speci@@ fic@@ ally , it &apos;s looking at a bl@@ ac@@ k@@ sm@@ ith in K@@ i@@ b@@ era in N@@ ai@@ ro@@ bi , who is tur@@ ning the s@@ ha@@ ft of a L@@ an@@ dro@@ ver into a col@@ d chis@@ el ."
"And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I con@@ c@@ ei@@ v@@ ably care about this ? &quot;"
"And the tru@@ th is , this guy can probably expl@@ ain this to you ."
This is E@@ ri@@ k H@@ er@@ s@@ man . You guys may have seen him around the con@@ fer@@ ence .
He goes by the mon@@ ik@@ er Wh@@ ite Afri@@ can .
"He &apos;s both a very well known American ge@@ ek , but he &apos;s also Ken@@ y@@ an ; he was born in Su@@ d@@ an , gre@@ w up in Ken@@ y@@ a ."
He is a bri@@ dge figure .
"He is someone who liter@@ ally has fe@@ et in both wor@@ l@@ ds — one in the world of the Afri@@ can technology community , one in the world of the American technology community ."
"And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this bl@@ ac@@ k@@ sm@@ ith in K@@ i@@ b@@ era and turn it into a story about re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ing technology , about innov@@ ating from con@@ stra@@ in@@ t , about looking for inspi@@ ra@@ tion based on re@@ using materi@@ als ."
"He kno@@ ws one world , and he &apos;s fin@@ ding a way to communic@@ ate it to another world , both of which he has de@@ ep conne@@ ctions to ."
"Th@@ ese bri@@ dge figu@@ res , I &apos;m pretty well con@@ vin@@ ced , are the future of how we try to make the world w@@ ide@@ r through using the we@@ b ."
"But the tri@@ ck with bri@@ d@@ ges is , ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely , you need someone to cro@@ ss them ."
And that &apos;s where we start talking about xen@@ o@@ ph@@ il@@ es .
"So if I found myself in the N@@ F@@ L , I su@@ spe@@ ct I would spend my of@@ f-@@ se@@ as@@ on n@@ ur@@ sing my w@@ oun@@ ds , en@@ j@@ oy@@ ing my house , so on and so for@@ th — possi@@ bly recor@@ ding a hi@@ p@@ -@@ ho@@ p al@@ bu@@ m ."

D@@ h@@ an@@ i has a tele@@ vision show .
"It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; D@@ h@@ an@@ i T@@ ac@@ k@@ les the G@@ lo@@ be . &quot; &quot; And every week on this tele@@ vision show , D@@ h@@ an@@ i tra@@ vel@@ s to a different n@@ ation of the world ."
He fin@@ ds a local s@@ por@@ ting team .
"He tra@@ ins with them for a week , and he pla@@ ys a mat@@ ch with them ."
And his reason for this is not just that he wan@@ ts to mas@@ ter Mu@@ ay Th@@ ai bo@@ x@@ ing .
"It &apos;s because , for him , s@@ port is the language that allo@@ ws him to en@@ coun@@ ter the full w@@ id@@ th and won@@ der of the world ."
F@@ or some of us it might be music . F@@ or some of us it might be food .
F@@ or a lot of us it might be liter@@ a@@ ture or wri@@ ting .
But there are all these different tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that al@@ low you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
The go@@ al of my T@@ al@@ k here is not to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the people in this room to em@@ bra@@ ce your xen@@ o@@ ph@@ ilia .
"My gu@@ ess — given that you &apos;re at a con@@ fer@@ ence called TE@@ D@@ G@@ lo@@ bal — is that most of you are xen@@ o@@ ph@@ il@@ es , whether or not you use that ter@@ m ."
My challenge instead is this .
It &apos;s not enough to make the person@@ al decis@@ ion that you want a w@@ ide@@ r world .
We have to figure out how to re@@ wi@@ re the systems that we have .
We have to fi@@ x our media .
We have to fi@@ x the inter@@ net . We have to fi@@ x our education .
We have to fi@@ x our im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion poli@@ cy .
"We need to look at ways of cre@@ ating ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity , of making trans@@ lation per@@ vas@@ i@@ ve , and we need to find ways to em@@ bra@@ ce and c@@ ele@@ bra@@ te these bri@@ dge figu@@ res ."
And we need to figure out how to cul@@ tiv@@ ate xen@@ o@@ ph@@ il@@ es .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
( Applause )
"B@@ as@@ ically , there &apos;s a maj@@ or demo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c ev@@ ent going on ."
And it may be that pas@@ sing the 50 percent ur@@ ban point is an economic ti@@ p@@ ping point . So the world now is a ma@@ p of conne@@ c@@ tivity .
It used to be that Par@@ is and Lon@@ don and New York were the lar@@ gest cities .
What we have now is the end of the ris@@ e of the W@@ est . That &apos;s over .
The ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate numbers are over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
"So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , v@@ ill@@ ages of the world are em@@ p@@ ty@@ ing out ."
"The question is , why ?"
"And here &apos;s the un@@ ro@@ man@@ tic tru@@ th — and the city air makes you free , they said in R@@ en@@ a@@ iss@@ ance Ger@@ many . So some people go to places like S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai but most go to the squ@@ at@@ ter cities where a@@ es@@ the@@ tics ru@@ le ."
And these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed by po@@ ver@@ ty .
They &apos;re people getting out of po@@ ver@@ ty as f@@ ast as they can .
"They &apos;re the dom@@ in@@ ant buil@@ ders and to a large ex@@ tent , the dom@@ in@@ ant desig@@ ners ."
They have ho@@ me@@ -@@ bre@@ wed in@@ fras@@ tr@@ uc@@ ture and vi@@ br@@ ant ur@@ ban life .

E@@ duc@@ ation is the ma@@ in ev@@ ent that can happen in cities .
What &apos;s going on in the stre@@ et in M@@ um@@ b@@ ai ?
A@@ l G@@ ore kno@@ ws . It &apos;s basically everything .
There &apos;s no u@@ ne@@ m@@ ploy@@ ment in squ@@ at@@ ter cities . E@@ very@@ one works .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ si@@ x@@ th of human@@ ity is there . It &apos;s so@@ on going to be more than that .
So here &apos;s the first p@@ un@@ ch line : cities have de@@ fu@@ sed the population b@@ om@@ b .
And here &apos;s the second p@@ un@@ ch line .
That &apos;s the news from do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn . Here it is in per@@ spe@@ ctive .
S@@ tar@@ s have sh@@ ined down on ear@@ th &apos;s life for bil@@ lions of years .

"The night before I was head@@ ing for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land , I was in@@ vi@@ ted to hos@@ t the fin@@ al of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s Go@@ t T@@ al@@ ent &quot; &quot; show in S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai with the 8@@ 0,000 live au@@ dience in the sta@@ di@@ um ."
G@@ u@@ ess who was the perfor@@ ming gu@@ est ?
S@@ us@@ an B@@ oy@@ le .
"And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to S@@ c@@ ot@@ land the next day . &quot; &quot; She s@@ an@@ g beauti@@ fully , and she even man@@ ag@@ ed to say a few words in Ch@@ in@@ ese : 送@@ 你@@ 葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hel@@ lo &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; than@@ k you , &quot; &quot; that ordin@@ ary stuff ."
It means &quot; &quot; green on@@ ion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
"Because it was a line from our Ch@@ in@@ ese paral@@ le@@ l S@@ us@@ an B@@ oy@@ le — a 5@@ 0@@ -@@ some year-@@ old woman , a ve@@ ge@@ table ven@@ d@@ or in S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai , who lo@@ ves sing@@ ing W@@ ester@@ n oper@@ a , but she didn &apos;t understand any Eng@@ lish or F@@ ren@@ ch or I@@ tal@@ ian , so she man@@ ag@@ ed to f@@ ill in the ly@@ ri@@ cs with ve@@ ge@@ table n@@ ames in Ch@@ in@@ ese ."
"( Laughter ) And the last sen@@ t@@ ence of N@@ es@@ su@@ n D@@ or@@ ma that she was sing@@ ing in the sta@@ di@@ um was &quot; &quot; green on@@ ion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; S@@ us@@ an B@@ oy@@ le was saying that , 8@@ 0,000 live au@@ dience s@@ an@@ g together ."
That was h@@ il@@ ari@@ ous .
So I gu@@ ess both S@@ us@@ an B@@ oy@@ le and this ve@@ ge@@ table ven@@ d@@ or in S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai be@@ lon@@ ged to o@@ ther@@ ness .
"They were the least expe@@ cted to be suc@@ cess@@ ful in the business called en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , yet their cou@@ rag@@ e and tal@@ ent bro@@ ught them through ."
And a show and a pl@@ at@@ form gave them the sta@@ ge to realize their dre@@ am@@ s .
"Well , being different is not that difficult ."
We are all different from different per@@ spe@@ c@@ tives .
"But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view ."
You may have the chan@@ ce to make a difference .
"My gener@@ ation has been very for@@ tun@@ ate to wit@@ ness and parti@@ ci@@ pate in the h@@ isto@@ ri@@ c trans@@ formation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years ."
"I remember that in the year of 19@@ 90 , when I was gra@@ du@@ ating from colle@@ ge , I was ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job in the sal@@ es de@@ par@@ t@@ ment of the first fi@@ ve@@ -@@ sta@@ r h@@ ot@@ el in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , Gre@@ at W@@ all S@@ her@@ a@@ ton — it &apos;s still there ."
"So after being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated by this J@@ apan@@ ese man@@ ag@@ er for a half an h@@ our , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , M@@ is@@ s Y@@ an@@ g , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I sum@@ mon@@ ed my cou@@ rag@@ e and po@@ ise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you se@@ ll ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a clu@@ e what a sal@@ es de@@ par@@ t@@ ment was about in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ sta@@ r h@@ ot@@ el ."
That was the first day I set my fo@@ ot in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ sta@@ r h@@ ot@@ el .
"A@@ ro@@ und the same time , I was going through an au@@ di@@ tion — the first ever open au@@ di@@ tion by national tele@@ vision in China — with another thous@@ and colle@@ ge gir@@ ls ."
"The produc@@ er told us they were looking for some s@@ we@@ et , inno@@ cent and beautiful f@@ res@@ h face ."
"So when it was my turn , I sto@@ od up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s person@@ ali@@ ties on tele@@ vision always have to be beautiful , s@@ we@@ et , inno@@ cent and , you know , sup@@ por@@ tive ?"
Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own voice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of off@@ en@@ ded them .
"But actually , they were im@@ pres@@ sed by my words ."
"And so I was in the second ro@@ und of compe@@ ti@@ tion , and then the third and the f@@ our@@ th ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seven ro@@ un@@ ds of compe@@ ti@@ tion , I was the last one to sur@@ vi@@ ve it ."
So I was on a national tele@@ vision pri@@ me@@ -@@ time show .
"And believe it or not , that was the first show on Ch@@ in@@ ese tele@@ vision that allo@@ wed its hos@@ ts to speak out of their own min@@ ds without read@@ ing an appro@@ ved s@@ cri@@ pt ."
( Applause ) And my we@@ ek@@ ly au@@ dience at that time was between 200 to 3@@ 00 million people .
"Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and C@@ ol@@ um@@ b@@ ia Uni@@ versity to pur@@ su@@ e my po@@ st@@ gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ dies , and then started my own media company , which was un@@ thought of during the years that I started my care@@ er ."
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve inter@@ vie@@ wed more than a thous@@ and people in the past .
"And sometimes I have young people appro@@ ach@@ ing me say , &quot; &quot; L@@ an , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel pro@@ u@@ d of that ."
But then we are also so for@@ tun@@ ate to wit@@ ness the trans@@ formation of the whole country .
I was in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing &apos;s b@@ id@@ ding for the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c G@@ ames .
I was re@@ presen@@ ting the S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai Ex@@ po .
I saw China em@@ bra@@ cing the world and v@@ ice ver@@ sa .
"But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young gener@@ ation up to ?"
"@@ How are they different , and what are the differ@@ ences they are going to make to shap@@ e the future of China , or at large , the world ?"
So today I want to talk about young people through the pl@@ at@@ form of social media .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?"
"Well this is a girl called G@@ u@@ o M@@ ei@@ m@@ ei — 20 years old , beautiful ."
"She sho@@ wed off her ex@@ pen@@ sive b@@ ag@@ s , clo@@ thes and car on her micro@@ blo@@ g , which is the Ch@@ in@@ ese ver@@ sion of T@@ wit@@ ter ."
And she cl@@ ai@@ med to be the gener@@ al man@@ ag@@ er of R@@ ed C@@ ross at the C@@ ha@@ m@@ ber of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce .
"She didn &apos;t realize that she ste@@ pped on a sen@@ si@@ tive ner@@ ve and aro@@ used national ques@@ tion@@ ing , almost a tur@@ mo@@ il , against the cre@@ di@@ bility of R@@ ed C@@ ross ."
"The contro@@ vers@@ y was so he@@ ated that the R@@ ed C@@ ross had to open a pre@@ ss con@@ fer@@ ence to c@@ lar@@ i@@ f@@ y it , and the inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ation is going on ."
"So far , as of today , we know that she her@@ self made up that ti@@ tle — probably because she feel@@ s pro@@ u@@ d to be as@@ soci@@ ated with char@@ ity ."
"A@@ ll those ex@@ pen@@ sive ite@@ ms were given to her as gi@@ f@@ ts by her b@@ oy@@ friend , who used to be a bo@@ ard mem@@ ber in a sub@@ di@@ vision of R@@ ed C@@ ross at C@@ ha@@ m@@ ber of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce ."
It &apos;s very com@@ plic@@ ated to expl@@ ain .
"But any@@ way , the public still doesn &apos;t bu@@ y it ."
It is still bo@@ il@@ ing .
"It sho@@ ws us a gener@@ al mis@@ tr@@ ust of government or govern@@ men@@ t-@@ bac@@ ked institu@@ tions , which l@@ ac@@ ked trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy in the past ."
And also it sho@@ wed us the power and the imp@@ act of social media as micro@@ blo@@ g .
"M@@ ic@@ ro@@ blo@@ g boo@@ med in the year of 20@@ 10 , with visi@@ tors d@@ ou@@ b@@ led and time spent on it tri@@ ple@@ d ."
"S@@ in@@ a@@ .@@ co@@ m , a maj@@ or news por@@ tal , alone has more than 1@@ 40 million micro@@ b@@ log@@ g@@ ers ."
"O@@ n T@@ en@@ cent , 200 million ."
"The most popu@@ lar b@@ log@@ ger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movi@@ e sta@@ r , and she has more than 9@@ .@@ 5 million follo@@ wers , or fan@@ s ."
"A@@ b@@ out 80 percent of those micro@@ b@@ log@@ g@@ ers are young people , under 30 years old ."
"And because , as you know , the tradi@@ tional media is still he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly contro@@ l@@ led by the government , social media of@@ fer@@ s an open@@ ing to let the ste@@ am out a little bit ."
"But because you don &apos;t have many other open@@ ings , the he@@ at coming out of this open@@ ing is sometimes very st@@ rong , ac@@ tive and even viol@@ ent ."
"So through micro@@ b@@ log@@ ging , we are able to understand Ch@@ in@@ ese y@@ outh even better ."
So how are they different ?
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , most of them were born in the 8@@ 0s and 9@@ 0s , under the on@@ e-@@ child poli@@ cy ."
"And because of se@@ le@@ cted ab@@ or@@ tion by fami@@ lies who fav@@ or@@ ed b@@ oys to gir@@ ls , now we have en@@ ded up with 30 million more young men than women ."
"That could pose a poten@@ tial dang@@ er to the society , but who kno@@ ws ; we &apos;re in a glo@@ bal@@ ized world , so they can look for gir@@ l@@ friends from other countries ."
M@@ os@@ t of them have fai@@ r@@ ly good education .
The il@@ liter@@ ac@@ y rate in China a@@ mon@@ g this gener@@ ation is under one percent .
"In cities , 80 percent of kids go to colle@@ ge ."
"But they are fac@@ ing an ag@@ ing China with a population ab@@ o@@ ve 6@@ 5 years old coming up with se@@ ven@@ -@@ poin@@ t-@@ some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 20@@ 30 ."
"And you know we have the tradi@@ tion that youn@@ ger gener@@ ations sup@@ port the el@@ ders fin@@ an@@ ci@@ ally , and taking care of them when they &apos;re si@@ ck ."
So it means young cou@@ ples will have to sup@@ port four parents who have a life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy of 7@@ 3 years old .
So making a living is not that easy for young people .
C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ates are not in shor@@ t sup@@ ply .
"In ur@@ ban are@@ as , colle@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ates find the star@@ ting sal@@ ary is about 4@@ 00 U.S. dollars a mon@@ th , while the a@@ verage r@@ ent is ab@@ o@@ ve $ 500 ."
"So what do they do ? They have to share space — squ@@ e@@ ez@@ ed in very li@@ mi@@ ted space to sa@@ ve money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tri@@ be of an@@ ts . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get mar@@ ried and bu@@ y their apar@@ t@@ ment , they figu@@ red out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to af@@ for@@ d their first apar@@ t@@ ment ."
"That ra@@ tio in America would only cost a couple five years to ear@@ n , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the sk@@ y@@ ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ting real es@@ ta@@ te pri@@ ce ."
"A@@ mon@@ g the 200 million mi@@ g@@ r@@ ant wor@@ k@@ ers , 60 percent of them are young people ."
They find themselves sort of s@@ and@@ w@@ ich@@ ed between the ur@@ ban are@@ as and the ru@@ ral are@@ as .
"M@@ os@@ t of them don &apos;t want to go back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , but they don &apos;t have the sense of be@@ lon@@ ging ."
"They work for longer hours with less in@@ come , less social wel@@ f@@ are ."
"And they &apos;re more v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able to job lo@@ s@@ ses , sub@@ ject to in@@ f@@ lation , ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing lo@@ ans from ban@@ ks , ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of the ren@@ min@@ bi , or dec@@ line of de@@ m@@ and from Euro@@ pe or America for the produc@@ ts they pro@@ duce ."
"L@@ ast year , though , an ap@@ p@@ all@@ ing in@@ ci@@ dent in a s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n O@@ E@@ M man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing com@@ po@@ und in China : 1@@ 3 young wor@@ k@@ ers in their late te@@ ens and early 20@@ s comm@@ it@@ ted su@@ ic@@ i@@ de , just one by one like cau@@ sing a con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous disease ."
But they died because of all different person@@ al reas@@ ons .
"But this whole in@@ ci@@ dent aro@@ used a huge out@@ c@@ ry from society about the is@@ ol@@ ation , both physical and mental , of these mi@@ g@@ r@@ ant wor@@ k@@ ers ."
"For those who do re@@ turn back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , they find themselves very wel@@ come lo@@ cally , because with the knowledge , sk@@ il@@ ls and net@@ works they have learned in the cities , with the as@@ sis@@ tance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more j@@ ob@@ s , up@@ gra@@ de local ag@@ ri@@ culture and create new business in the less developed market ."
"So for the past few years , the co@@ as@@ tal are@@ as , they found themselves in a shor@@ ta@@ ge of lab@@ or ."
These diag@@ ra@@ ms show a more gener@@ al social bac@@ k@@ ground .
"The first one is the Eng@@ el@@ s co@@ ef@@ fici@@ ent , which expl@@ ain@@ s that the cost of dai@@ ly ne@@ ces@@ si@@ ties has dro@@ pped its per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge all through the past dec@@ ad@@ e , in terms of family in@@ come , to about 3@@ 7@@ -@@ some percent ."
"But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 3@@ 9 percent , in@@ dic@@ ating a ris@@ ing living cost ."
The G@@ ini co@@ ef@@ fici@@ ent has already pas@@ sed the dang@@ er@@ ous line of 0@@ .@@ 4 .
Now it &apos;s 0@@ .@@ 5 — even wor@@ se than that in America — sho@@ wing us the in@@ come in@@ equ@@ ality .
And so you see this whole society getting f@@ rus@@ tra@@ ted about lo@@ sing some of its mo@@ bility .
"And also , the b@@ it@@ ter@@ ness and even re@@ sen@@ t@@ ment to@@ wards the ri@@ ch and the powerful is quite w@@ ide@@ spre@@ ad ."
So any ac@@ cus@@ ations of cor@@ ru@@ ption or bac@@ k@@ do@@ or de@@ al@@ ings between au@@ thor@@ i@@ ties or business would aro@@ use a social out@@ c@@ ry or even un@@ rest .
"So through some of the h@@ ot@@ test to@@ pic@@ s on micro@@ b@@ log@@ ging , we can see what young people care most about ."
So@@ cial j@@ us@@ tice and government ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility run@@ s the first in what they de@@ m@@ and .
"For the past dec@@ ad@@ e or so , a mas@@ sive ur@@ ban@@ ization and develo@@ pment have let us wit@@ ness a lot of re@@ por@@ ts on the for@@ ced demo@@ li@@ tion of p@@ riv@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ty ."
And it has aro@@ used huge ang@@ er and f@@ rus@@ tra@@ tion a@@ mon@@ g our young gener@@ ation .
"S@@ ome@@ times people get kil@@ led , and sometimes people set themselves on fi@@ re to prote@@ st ."
"So when these in@@ ci@@ dents are re@@ por@@ ted more and more fre@@ qu@@ ently on the Internet , people c@@ ry for the government to take ac@@ tions to stop this ."
"So the good news is that ear@@ li@@ er this year , the state coun@@ ci@@ l pas@@ sed a new re@@ gu@@ lation on house re@@ qu@@ is@@ i@@ tion and demo@@ li@@ tion and pas@@ sed the right to order for@@ ced demo@@ li@@ tion from local govern@@ ments to the cour@@ t ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , many other issu@@ es con@@ cer@@ ning public sa@@ fe@@ ty is a ho@@ t to@@ pi@@ c on the Internet ."
"We heard about pol@@ lu@@ ted air , pol@@ lu@@ ted water , po@@ is@@ on@@ ed food ."
"And gu@@ ess what , we have f@@ ak@@ ed be@@ ef ."
"They have sor@@ ts of in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that you b@@ rus@@ h on a piece of ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en or fish , and it turns it to look like be@@ ef ."
"And then la@@ tely , people are very con@@ cer@@ ned about co@@ o@@ king o@@ il , because thousands of people have been found &#91; re@@ fin@@ ing &#93; co@@ o@@ king o@@ il from re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant s@@ lo@@ p ."
So all these things have aro@@ used a huge out@@ c@@ ry from the Internet .
"And for@@ tu@@ na@@ tely , we have seen the government respon@@ ding more ti@@ me@@ ly and also more fre@@ qu@@ ently to the public con@@ cer@@ ns ."
"Wh@@ ile young people see@@ m to be very sure about their parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion in public poli@@ cy@@ -@@ making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their person@@ al life ."
China is so@@ on to pas@@ s the U.S.
as the number one market for lu@@ x@@ u@@ ry b@@ ran@@ ds — that &apos;s not inclu@@ ding the Ch@@ in@@ ese ex@@ pen@@ d@@ it@@ u@@ res in Euro@@ pe and el@@ se@@ where .
"But you know what , half of those con@@ su@@ mers are ear@@ ning a sal@@ ary be@@ low 2@@ ,000 U.S. dollars ."
They &apos;re not ri@@ ch at all .
They &apos;re taking those b@@ ag@@ s and clo@@ thes as a sense of identi@@ ty and social sta@@ tu@@ s .
And this is a girl ex@@ plic@@ it@@ ly saying on a T@@ V da@@ ting show that she would rather c@@ ry in a B@@ M@@ W than s@@ mil@@ e on a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
"But of course , we do have young people who would still pre@@ fer to s@@ mil@@ e , whether in a B@@ M@@ W or &#91; on &#93; a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle ."
"So in the next picture , you see a very popu@@ lar ph@@ en@@ omenon called &quot; &quot; n@@ ak@@ ed &quot; &quot; we@@ d@@ ding , or &quot; &quot; n@@ ak@@ ed &quot; &quot; mar@@ ri@@ age ."
"It does not mean they will we@@ ar nothing in the we@@ d@@ ding , but it sho@@ ws that these young cou@@ ples are ready to get mar@@ ried without a house , without a car , without a dia@@ mon@@ d ring and without a we@@ d@@ ding ban@@ qu@@ et , to show their comm@@ it@@ ment to true love ."
"And also , people are doing good through social media ."
And the first picture sho@@ wed us that a tr@@ uc@@ k c@@ ag@@ ing 500 ho@@ me@@ less and k@@ id@@ n@@ ap@@ ped do@@ gs for food pro@@ cess@@ ing was spo@@ t@@ ted and sto@@ pped on the high@@ way with the whole country wat@@ ching through micro@@ b@@ log@@ ging .
"P@@ e@@ ople were don@@ ating money , do@@ g food and of@@ fer@@ ing vol@@ un@@ te@@ er work to stop that tr@@ uc@@ k ."
"And after hours of ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation , 500 do@@ gs were res@@ cu@@ ed ."
And here also people are hel@@ ping to find m@@ iss@@ ing children .
A father pos@@ ted his son &apos;s picture on@@ to the Internet .
"A@@ f@@ ter thousands of re@@ sen@@ ds in rela@@ y , the child was found , and we wit@@ ne@@ s@@ sed the re@@ un@@ ion of the family through micro@@ b@@ log@@ ging ."
So hap@@ pin@@ ess is the most popu@@ lar word we have heard through the past two years .
"H@@ ap@@ pin@@ ess is not only rela@@ ted to person@@ al experi@@ ences and person@@ al val@@ ues , but also , it &apos;s about the environment ."
Pe@@ ople are thinking about the follo@@ wing questions : A@@ re we going to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice our environment fu@@ r@@ ther to pro@@ duce high@@ er G@@ D@@ P ?
"@@ How are we going to per@@ form our social and political re@@ form to keep p@@ ace with economic growth , to keep susta@@ in@@ ability and sta@@ bility ?"
"And also , how cap@@ able is the system of self-@@ cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness to keep more people con@@ tent with all sor@@ ts of fri@@ ction going on at the same time ?"
I gu@@ ess these are the questions people are going to answer .
And our youn@@ ger gener@@ ation are going to trans@@ form this country while at the same time being trans@@ for@@ med themselves .
Thank you very much .

This back here was my brain cancer .
Is@@ n &apos;t it n@@ ice ?
"( Laughter ) The key ph@@ ras@@ e is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; p@@ he@@ w ."
"In W@@ ester@@ n cul@@ tures , when you have cancer , it &apos;s as if you dis@@ appe@@ ar in a way ."
"@@ Y@@ our life as a complex human being is re@@ plac@@ ed by medi@@ cal data : Y@@ our images , your exam@@ s , your la@@ b val@@ ues , a lis@@ t of me@@ dic@@ ines ."
And everyone changes as well .
You su@@ d@@ den@@ ly become a disease on le@@ gs .
D@@ oc@@ tors start spe@@ aking a language which you don &apos;t understand .
They start poin@@ ting their fin@@ g@@ ers at your body and your images .
"P@@ e@@ ople start chan@@ ging as well because they start de@@ al@@ ing with the disease , instead of with the human being ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; What did the doc@@ tor say ? &quot; &quot; before even saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ lo . &quot; &quot; And in the me@@ an@@ while , you &apos;re left with questions to which no@@ body gi@@ ves an answer ."
These are the &quot; &quot; C@@ an I ? &quot; &quot; questions : C@@ an I work while I have cancer ?
C@@ an I study ? C@@ an I make love ? C@@ an I be crea@@ tive ?
"And you won@@ der , &quot; &quot; What have I done to de@@ ser@@ ve this ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I change something about my li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I do something ?"
"A@@ re there any other op@@ tions ? &quot; &quot; And , obvi@@ ously , doc@@ tors are the good guys in all these s@@ cen@@ ar@@ ios , because they are very pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ al and de@@ dic@@ ated to cu@@ ring you ."
"But they also are very used to having to deal with pati@@ ents , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes lo@@ se the idea that this is tor@@ ture for you and that you become , liter@@ ally , a pati@@ ent — &quot; pati@@ ent &quot; means &quot; the one who wa@@ its . &quot;"
"But instead , you &apos;re for@@ ced there to wa@@ it in the hands of a ser@@ ies of very pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ al str@@ ang@@ ers ."
"Wh@@ ile I was in the hos@@ p@@ ital , I asked for a prin@@ te@@ d-@@ out picture of my cancer and I spo@@ ke with it ."
"It was really hard to ob@@ tain , because it &apos;s not common prac@@ tice to ask for a picture of your own cancer ."
"I tal@@ ked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me ."
There &apos;s more to me .
"A cu@@ re , wh@@ ich@@ ever it is , will have to deal with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the hos@@ p@@ ital against medi@@ cal ad@@ v@@ ice ."
I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to change my relation@@ ship with the cancer and I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as dras@@ tic as a sur@@ ger@@ y .
"So my best be@@ t was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be ac@@ ces@@ sed by any@@ one ."
"So I created a w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite , which is called L@@ a C@@ u@@ ra , on which I put my medi@@ cal data , on@@ line ."
I actually had to h@@ ack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another spe@@ e@@ ch .
"( Laughter ) I ch@@ ose this word , L@@ a C@@ u@@ ra — L@@ a C@@ u@@ ra in I@@ tal@@ ian means &quot; &quot; the cu@@ re &quot; &quot; — because in many different cul@@ tures , the word &quot; &quot; cu@@ re &quot; &quot; can mean many different things ."
"In our W@@ ester@@ n cul@@ tures , it means er@@ a@@ dic@@ ating or re@@ vers@@ ing a disease , but in different cul@@ tures , for example , a culture from A@@ sia , from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ ean , from La@@ tin countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things ."
"I was interested in the social cu@@ re , I was interested in the psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ical cu@@ re , I was interested in the spi@@ rit@@ ual cu@@ re , I was interested in the emo@@ tional cu@@ re , I was interested in any form of cu@@ re ."
"And , it worked ."
The L@@ a C@@ u@@ ra w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite went vi@@ ral .
"For example , many thousands of vide@@ os , images , pic@@ tures , art perfor@@ man@@ ces were produc@@ ed for L@@ a C@@ u@@ ra ."
"For example , here we see Fran@@ ces@@ ca F@@ ini in her perfor@@ man@@ ce ."
"O@@ r , as arti@@ st P@@ a@@ tri@@ ck L@@ ich@@ ty has done : He produc@@ ed a 3@@ D s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture of my tu@@ mor and put it on sal@@ e on Th@@ in@@ gi@@ verse ."
"Now you can have my cancer , too !"
"And this was going on — scientists , the tradi@@ tional me@@ dic@@ ine ex@@ per@@ ts , se@@ ver@@ al rese@@ arch@@ ers , doc@@ tors — all conne@@ cted with me to give ad@@ v@@ ice ."
"And together , we were able to form a stra@@ te@@ g@@ y for my own cu@@ re in many langu@@ ages , ac@@ cor@@ ding to many cul@@ tures ."
"And the cur@@ r@@ ent stra@@ te@@ g@@ y s@@ pan@@ s the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble for me ."
"@@ &#91; Su@@ rg@@ er@@ y &#93; The follo@@ w@@ -@@ up M@@ R@@ I@@ s sho@@ wed , l@@ uc@@ ki@@ ly , little to no growth of the cancer ."
So I was able to take my time and cho@@ ose .
"I ch@@ ose the doc@@ tor I wanted to work with , I ch@@ ose the hos@@ p@@ ital I wanted to sta@@ y in , and in the me@@ an@@ while , I was sup@@ por@@ ted by thousands of people , n@@ one of wh@@ om felt p@@ ity for me ."
"E@@ very@@ one felt like they could take an ac@@ tive ro@@ le in hel@@ ping me to get well , and this was the most important part of L@@ a C@@ u@@ ra ."
What are the out@@ comes ?
"I &apos;m fin@@ e , as you can see , pretty fin@@ e ."
"( Applause ) I had ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent news after the sur@@ ger@@ y — I have — I had a very lo@@ w@@ -@@ gra@@ de g@@ li@@ oma , which is a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; kind of cancer which doesn &apos;t grow a lot ."
I have completely changed my life and my li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le .
E@@ very@@ thing I did was thou@@ gh@@ t@@ fully desig@@ ned to get me eng@@ ag@@ ed .
"U@@ p until the very last few minutes of the sur@@ ger@@ y , which was very in@@ ten@@ se , a ma@@ tri@@ x of elec@@ tro@@ des was im@@ plan@@ ted in my brain from this side , to be able to build a fun@@ c@@ tional ma@@ p of what the brain contro@@ ls ."
"And right before the oper@@ ation , we were able to dis@@ cus@@ s the fun@@ c@@ tional ma@@ p of my brain with the doc@@ tor , to understand which ris@@ ks I was run@@ ning into and if there were any I wanted to av@@ o@@ id ."
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , there were ."
&#91; O@@ pen &#93; And this open@@ ness was really the fun@@ da@@ mental part of L@@ a C@@ u@@ ra .
"Th@@ ous@@ ands of people shar@@ ed their stories , their experi@@ ences ."
D@@ oc@@ tors got to talk with people they don &apos;t usu@@ ally con@@ sul@@ t when they think about cancer .
"I &apos;m a self-@@ f@@ oun@@ ding , contin@@ u@@ ous state of trans@@ lation a@@ mon@@ g many different langu@@ ages , in which science me@@ ets emo@@ tion and con@@ ven@@ tional research me@@ ets tradi@@ tional research ."
&#91; So@@ ci@@ e@@ ty &#93; The most important thing of L@@ a C@@ u@@ ra was to feel like a part of a really eng@@ ag@@ ed and conne@@ cted society wh@@ ose wel@@ l@@ ness really depen@@ ds on the wel@@ l@@ ness of all of its com@@ pon@@ ents .
This global perfor@@ man@@ ce is my open@@ -@@ sour@@ ce cu@@ re for cancer .
"And from what I feel , it &apos;s a cu@@ re for me , but for us all ."
Thank you .

"A big challenge is , how should the iP@@ ad@@ s be used , and what ap@@ ps should we put on the iP@@ ad@@ s ?"

All right . V@@ en@@ n diag@@ ra@@ m . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very hel@@ p@@ ful either .
"The thing that made me understand that quot@@ e and really kind of what art , at least the art of fic@@ tion , was , was working with kids ."
I used to be a sum@@ mer cam@@ p coun@@ se@@ lor .

"I would tell them about how , on the we@@ ek@@ ends , I would go home and I would sp@@ y for the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of Eng@@ land ."
You &apos;re the guy who spi@@ es for the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of Eng@@ land . &quot; &quot; And I had been w@@ ai@@ ting my whole life for str@@ ang@@ ers to come up and ask me that question .
"And so Ri@@ le@@ y was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen ."
"And Ri@@ le@@ y knew she didn &apos;t grow a mel@@ on in seven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a w@@ ei@@ r@@ d place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to ."
It &apos;s anything . Ar@@ t can get us to that place .
"She was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fic@@ tion ."
I &apos;m going to call it won@@ der .
It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
"It &apos;s why in two days , people will be des@@ cen@@ ding on D@@ u@@ bl@@ in to take the wal@@ king to@@ ur of B@@ lo@@ om@@ s@@ day and see everything that happened in &quot; &quot; U@@ ly@@ s@@ ses , &quot; &quot; even though n@@ one of that happened ."
"K@@ i@@ ds can get there a lot more eas@@ i@@ ly than ad@@ ul@@ ts can , and that &apos;s why I love wri@@ ting for kids ."

I would like to talk to you about a story about a small to@@ wn ki@@ d .
"I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story ."
He lives in a small v@@ ill@@ age in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ om@@ alia .
H@@ is v@@ ill@@ age is ne@@ ar M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u .
D@@ ro@@ ught dri@@ ves the small v@@ ill@@ age into po@@ ver@@ ty and to the b@@ rin@@ k of star@@ v@@ ation .
"W@@ ith nothing left for him there , he le@@ av@@ es for the big city , in this case , M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u , the cap@@ ital of S@@ om@@ alia ."
"When he ar@@ ri@@ ves , there are no oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties , no j@@ ob@@ s , no way forward ."
He ends up living in a tent city on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u .
"M@@ ay@@ be a year pas@@ ses , nothing ."
"One day , he &apos;s appro@@ ach@@ ed by a gen@@ t@@ le@@ man who of@@ fer@@ s to take him to l@@ un@@ ch , then to din@@ ner , to bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast ."
"He me@@ ets this dy@@ na@@ mic group of people , and they give him a bre@@ ak ."
"He &apos;s given a bit of money to bu@@ y h@@ im@@ self some new clo@@ thes , money to sen@@ d back home to his family ."
He is in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed to this young woman .
He ev@@ en@@ tually gets mar@@ ried .
He star@@ ts this new life .
He has a pur@@ pose in life .
"One beautiful day in M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u , under an az@@ u@@ re blu@@ e sk@@ y , a car b@@ om@@ b goes off ."
"That small to@@ wn ki@@ d with the big city dre@@ am@@ s was the su@@ ic@@ i@@ de b@@ om@@ ber , and that dy@@ na@@ mic group of people were al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b , a ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ t organ@@ ization lin@@ ked to al Q@@ a@@ e@@ da ."
So how does the story of a small to@@ wn ki@@ d just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blo@@ wing h@@ im@@ self up ?
He was w@@ ai@@ ting .
"He was w@@ ai@@ ting for an opportunity , w@@ ai@@ ting to beg@@ in his future , w@@ ai@@ ting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along ."
This was the first thing that pu@@ l@@ led him out of what we call w@@ ai@@ th@@ o@@ od .
And his story re@@ pe@@ a@@ ts itself in ur@@ ban cen@@ ters around the world .
"It is the story of the dis@@ en@@ f@@ ran@@ chis@@ ed , u@@ ne@@ m@@ ploy@@ ed ur@@ ban y@@ outh who s@@ par@@ ks ri@@ ots in Jo@@ h@@ an@@ ne@@ s@@ bur@@ g , s@@ par@@ ks ri@@ ots in Lon@@ don , who re@@ ach@@ es out for something other than w@@ ai@@ th@@ o@@ od ."
"For young people , the pro@@ mis@@ e of the city , the big city dre@@ am is that of opportunity , of j@@ ob@@ s , of we@@ al@@ th , but young people are not shar@@ ing in the pros@@ per@@ ity of their cities ."
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s y@@ outh who su@@ f@@ fer from the high@@ est u@@ ne@@ m@@ ploy@@ ment ra@@ tes .
"B@@ y 20@@ 30 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 1@@ 8 ."
"If we do not inclu@@ de young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provi@@ de them oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties , the story of w@@ ai@@ th@@ o@@ od , the ga@@ te@@ way to ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m , to violence , to gan@@ gs , will be the story of cities 2@@ .@@ 0 ."
"And in my city of bir@@ th , M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u , 70 percent of young people su@@ f@@ fer from u@@ ne@@ m@@ ploy@@ ment ."
"@@ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school ."
They pretty much do nothing .
"I went back to M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u last mon@@ th , and I went to vis@@ it M@@ ad@@ ina H@@ os@@ p@@ ital , the hos@@ p@@ ital I was born in ."
"I remember standing in front of that bu@@ l@@ le@@ t-@@ ri@@ d@@ den hos@@ p@@ ital thinking , what if I had never left ?"
What if I had been for@@ ced into that same state of w@@ ai@@ th@@ o@@ od ?
W@@ ould I have become a ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ t ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
My reason for being in M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u that mon@@ th was actually to hos@@ t a y@@ outh lead@@ er@@ ship and en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship sum@@ m@@ it .
I bro@@ ught together about 90 young S@@ om@@ al@@ i lead@@ ers .
We s@@ at down and bra@@ in@@ s@@ tor@@ med on solu@@ tions to the big@@ gest challen@@ ges fac@@ ing their city .
One of the young men in the room was A@@ den .
"He went to uni@@ versity in M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u , gra@@ du@@ ated ."
"There were no j@@ ob@@ s , no oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties ."
"I remember him telling me , because he was a colle@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ate , u@@ ne@@ m@@ ploy@@ ed , f@@ rus@@ tra@@ ted , that he was the per@@ fect tar@@ get for al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b and other ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ t organ@@ iz@@ ations , to be rec@@ ru@@ i@@ ted ."
They s@@ ou@@ ght people like him out .
But his story takes a different ro@@ u@@ te .
"In M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u , the big@@ gest bar@@ ri@@ er to getting from point A to point B are the ro@@ ad@@ s ."
"T@@ w@@ en@@ ty@@ -@@ three years of civi@@ l war have completely de@@ st@@ roy@@ ed the ro@@ ad system , and a mo@@ tor@@ b@@ ike can be the eas@@ i@@ est way to get around ."
A@@ den saw an opportunity and sei@@ z@@ ed it .
He started a mo@@ tor@@ b@@ ike company .
He began ren@@ ting out mo@@ tor@@ b@@ ikes to local re@@ si@@ dents who couldn &apos;t nor@@ m@@ ally af@@ for@@ d them .
"He b@@ ou@@ ght 10 b@@ ikes , with the help of family and friends , and his dre@@ am is to ev@@ en@@ tually ex@@ p@@ and to se@@ ver@@ al hundre@@ d within the next three years ."
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to identi@@ f@@ y and sei@@ ze a new opportunity .
"It &apos;s en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship , and I believe en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship can be the most powerful to@@ ol against w@@ ai@@ th@@ o@@ od ."
It em@@ po@@ wers young people to be the crea@@ tors of the very economic oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties they are so des@@ per@@ a@@ tely se@@ ek@@ ing .
And you can tra@@ in young people to be en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ s .
"I want to talk to you about a young man who atten@@ ded one of my me@@ e@@ tin@@ gs , Mo@@ ha@@ med Mo@@ ha@@ m@@ ou@@ d , a fl@@ oris@@ t ."
He was hel@@ ping me tra@@ in some of the young people at the sum@@ m@@ it in en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship and how to be inno@@ va@@ tive and how to create a culture of en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship .
"He &apos;s actually the first fl@@ oris@@ t M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u has seen in over 2@@ 2 years , and until re@@ cen@@ tly , until Mo@@ ha@@ med came along , if you wanted flo@@ wers at your we@@ d@@ ding , you used plas@@ tic b@@ ou@@ qu@@ ets shi@@ pped from ab@@ ro@@ ad ."
"If you asked someone , &quot; Wh@@ en was the last time you saw f@@ res@@ h flo@@ wers ? &quot;"
"@@ for many who gre@@ w up under civi@@ l war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever . &quot; &quot; So Mo@@ ha@@ med saw an opportunity ."
He started a lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ ing and design fl@@ or@@ al company .
"He created a far@@ m right outside of M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u , and started growing tu@@ li@@ ps and li@@ lies , which he said could sur@@ vi@@ ve the har@@ s@@ h M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u cli@@ mate ."
"And he began deli@@ ver@@ ing flo@@ wers to we@@ d@@ din@@ gs , cre@@ ating gar@@ den@@ s at h@@ om@@ es and busin@@ es@@ ses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on cre@@ ating M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u &apos;s first public par@@ k in 2@@ 2 years ."
There &apos;s no public par@@ k in M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ h@@ u .
"He wan@@ ts to create a space where fami@@ lies , young people , can come together , and , as he says , s@@ me@@ ll the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ro@@ ses ."
"And he doesn &apos;t grow ro@@ ses because they use too much water , by the way ."
"So the first step is to inspi@@ re young people , and in that room , Mo@@ ha@@ med &apos;s pres@@ ence had a really pro@@ found imp@@ act on the y@@ outh in that room ."
They had never really thought about star@@ ting up a business .
"They &apos;ve thought about working for an N@@ G@@ O , working for the government , but his story , his innov@@ ation , really had a st@@ rong imp@@ act on them ."
He for@@ ced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
"He em@@ power@@ ed them to believe that they could be en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ s , that they could be change mak@@ ers ."
"B@@ y the end of the day , they were coming up with inno@@ va@@ tive solu@@ tions to some of the big@@ gest challen@@ ges fac@@ ing their city ."
They came up with en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al solu@@ tions to local problems .
"So inspi@@ ring young people and cre@@ ating a culture of en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship is a really great step , but young people need cap@@ ital to make their ideas a reality ."
They need ex@@ per@@ tise and men@@ tor@@ ship to gu@@ i@@ de them in develo@@ ping and lau@@ n@@ ching their busin@@ es@@ ses .
"C@@ on@@ ne@@ ct young people with the resour@@ ces they need , provi@@ de them the sup@@ port they need to go from ide@@ ation to cre@@ ation , and you will create ca@@ tal@@ y@@ s@@ ts for ur@@ ban growth ."
"For me , en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship is more than just star@@ ting up a business ."
It &apos;s about cre@@ ating a social imp@@ act .
Mo@@ ha@@ med is not simply sel@@ ling flo@@ wers .
I believe he is sel@@ ling hope .
"H@@ is Pe@@ ace Par@@ k , and that &apos;s what he c@@ alls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually trans@@ form the way people see their city ."
A@@ den hi@@ red stre@@ et kids to help r@@ ent out and main@@ tain those b@@ ikes for him .
He gave them the opportunity to es@@ cap@@ e the paral@@ y@@ sis of w@@ ai@@ th@@ o@@ od .
These young en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ s are having a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous imp@@ act in their cities .
"So my sug@@ g@@ es@@ tion is , turn y@@ outh into en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ s , in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate and n@@ ur@@ ture their in@@ her@@ ent innov@@ ation , and you will have more stories of flo@@ wers and Pe@@ ace Par@@ ks than of car b@@ om@@ bs and w@@ ai@@ th@@ o@@ od ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real challen@@ ges is to innov@@ ate fun@@ da@@ men@@ tally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enth@@ r@@ al@@ led to in education ."
This one teach@@ er didn &apos;t take it ser@@ i@@ ously .
"I want to say that really and tru@@ ly , after these incredi@@ ble spe@@ ech@@ es and ideas that are being spre@@ ad , I am in the aw@@ k@@ ward posi@@ tion of being here to talk to you today about tele@@ vision ."
So most everyone wat@@ ches T@@ V .
We like it . We like some parts of it .
"@@ Here in America , people actually love T@@ V ."
The a@@ verage American wat@@ ches T@@ V for almost 5 hours a day .
Okay ?
"Now I happen to make my living these days in tele@@ vision , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing ."
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
"They , in fact , ber@@ ate it ."
"They call it stu@@ pi@@ d , and wor@@ se , believe me ."
"My mother , growing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; idi@@ ot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to de@@ b@@ ate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good T@@ V or bad T@@ V ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe tele@@ vision has a con@@ science ."
"So why I believe that tele@@ vision has a con@@ science is that I actually believe that tele@@ vision direc@@ tly re@@ fle@@ cts the mor@@ al , political , social and emo@@ tional need sta@@ tes of our n@@ ation — that tele@@ vision is how we actually dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate our entire val@@ ue system ."
"So all these things are uni@@ qu@@ ely human , and they all ad@@ d up to our idea of con@@ science ."
"Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad T@@ V ."
We &apos;re talking about popu@@ lar T@@ V .
We &apos;re talking about top@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ ra@@ ted sho@@ ws over the course of 50 years .
"@@ How do these N@@ i@@ el@@ se@@ n ra@@ tin@@ gs re@@ fle@@ ct not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , colle@@ ctive un@@ consci@@ ous , but how do these top@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ ra@@ ted sho@@ ws over 50 years re@@ fle@@ ct the idea of our social con@@ science ?"
"@@ How does tele@@ vision evol@@ ve over time , and what does this say about our society ?"
"Now spe@@ aking of evol@@ ution , from bas@@ ic bio@@ logy , you probably remember that the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , inclu@@ ding humans , have four bas@@ ic pri@@ mal in@@ s@@ tin@@ cts ."
You have hun@@ ger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the ur@@ ge for ac@@ qu@@ is@@ iti@@ ven@@ ess .
"As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evol@@ ved over time to tem@@ per , or ta@@ me , these bas@@ ic anima@@ l in@@ s@@ tin@@ cts ."
We have the cap@@ ac@@ ity to lau@@ gh and c@@ ry .
"We feel a@@ we , we feel p@@ ity ."
That is se@@ par@@ ate and ap@@ art from the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom .
The other thing about human be@@ ings is that we love to be en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ed .
We love to wat@@ ch T@@ V .
This is something that c@@ lear@@ ly se@@ para@@ tes us from the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom .
"An@@ im@@ als might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to wat@@ ch ."
So I had an am@@ bi@@ tion to disco@@ ver what could be under@@ sto@@ od from this uni@@ qu@@ ely human relation@@ ship between tele@@ vision progra@@ ms and the human consci@@ ous .
Why has tele@@ vision en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment evol@@ ved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this car@@ to@@ on de@@ vi@@ l or an@@ ge@@ l sitting on our sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders .
"I@@ s tele@@ vision liter@@ ally fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing as our con@@ science , tem@@ p@@ ting us and re@@ war@@ ding us at the same time ?"
"So to beg@@ in to answer these questions , we did a research study ."
We went back 50 years to the 19@@ 5@@ 9 / 19@@ 60 tele@@ vision se@@ as@@ on .
We sur@@ ve@@ y@@ ed the top@@ -@@ 20 N@@ i@@ el@@ se@@ n sho@@ ws every year for 50 years — a thous@@ and sho@@ ws .
"We tal@@ ked to over 3@@ ,000 individu@@ als — almost 3@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 — ag@@ ed 1@@ 8 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emo@@ tion@@ ally ."
How did you feel wat@@ ching every single one of these sho@@ ws ?
Di@@ d you feel a sense of mor@@ al am@@ big@@ u@@ ity ?
Di@@ d you feel out@@ rag@@ e ? Di@@ d you lau@@ gh ?
What did this mean for you ?
"So to our global TED au@@ di@@ ences , I want to say that this was a U.S. s@@ am@@ ple ."
"But as you can see , these emo@@ tional need sta@@ tes are tru@@ ly uni@@ vers@@ al ."
"And on a fac@@ tual bas@@ is , over 80 percent of the U.S. &apos; s most popu@@ lar sho@@ ws are ex@@ por@@ ted around the world ."
So I really hope our global au@@ di@@ ences can rela@@ te .
"T@@ w@@ o ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ments before our first data sli@@ de : F@@ or inspi@@ ring me to even think about the idea of con@@ science and the tri@@ cks that con@@ science can play on us on a dai@@ ly bas@@ is , I than@@ k le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary ra@@ b@@ bi , J@@ ack S@@ ter@@ n ."
"And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to than@@ k TED community super@@ sta@@ r H@@ ans R@@ os@@ ling , who you may have just seen ."
"O@@ kay , here we go ."
"So here you see , from 19@@ 60 to 20@@ 10 , the 50 years of our study ."
"T@@ w@@ o things we &apos;re going to start with — the inspi@@ ra@@ tion state and the mor@@ al am@@ big@@ u@@ ity state , which , for this pur@@ pose , we defin@@ ed inspi@@ ra@@ tion as tele@@ vision sho@@ ws that u@@ pli@@ ft me , that make me feel much more posi@@ tive about the world ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ big@@ u@@ ity are tele@@ visi@@ ons sho@@ ws in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
"As we start , you see in 19@@ 60 inspi@@ ra@@ tion is h@@ ol@@ ding ste@@ ad@@ y ."
That &apos;s what we &apos;re wat@@ ching T@@ V for .
M@@ or@@ al am@@ big@@ u@@ ity star@@ ts to cli@@ m@@ b .
"@@ Right at the end of the 6@@ 0s , mor@@ al am@@ big@@ u@@ ity is going up , inspi@@ ra@@ tion is kind of on the wan@@ e ."
Why ?
"The C@@ u@@ ban M@@ is@@ si@@ le C@@ risis , J@@ F@@ K is sho@@ t , the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l Ri@@ ghts movement , ra@@ ce ri@@ ots , the Vi@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ m W@@ ar , M@@ L@@ K is sho@@ t , B@@ ob@@ by Ken@@ ne@@ dy is sho@@ t , W@@ a@@ ter@@ g@@ ate ."
Lo@@ ok what happens .
"In 19@@ 70 , inspi@@ ra@@ tion pl@@ um@@ me@@ ts ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ big@@ u@@ ity takes off .
"They cro@@ ss , but R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an , a tele@@ gen@@ ic pre@@ si@@ dent , is in off@@ ice ."
It &apos;s trying to reco@@ ver .
"But look , it can &apos;t : A@@ I@@ D@@ S , I@@ ran@@ -@@ Con@@ tra , the Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ger dis@@ as@@ ter , Ch@@ er@@ no@@ by@@ l ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ big@@ u@@ ity be@@ comes the dom@@ in@@ ant me@@ me in tele@@ vision from 19@@ 90 for the next 20 years .
T@@ ake a look at this .
This char@@ t is going to do@@ cu@@ ment a very si@@ mil@@ ar tr@@ end .
"But in this case , we have com@@ for@@ t — the bu@@ b@@ ble in red — social com@@ men@@ tar@@ y and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence in blu@@ e and green ."
"Now this time on T@@ V you have &quot; &quot; B@@ on@@ an@@ z@@ a , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t for@@ get , you have &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ f@@ f@@ ith , &quot; &quot; you have do@@ me@@ sti@@ c sho@@ ws all about com@@ for@@ t ."
This is ris@@ ing . C@@ om@@ for@@ t sta@@ ys whole .
I@@ r@@ re@@ ver@@ ence star@@ ts to ris@@ e .
So@@ cial com@@ men@@ tar@@ y is all of a su@@ d@@ den sp@@ ik@@ ing up .
"You get to 19@@ 6@@ 9 , and look what happens ."
"You have com@@ for@@ t , ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence , and social com@@ men@@ tar@@ y , not only bat@@ t@@ ling it out in our society , but you liter@@ ally have two es@@ tab@@ lis@@ h@@ ment sho@@ ws — &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Go@@ mer P@@ y@@ le &quot; &quot; — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 are the num@@ ber@@ -@@ tw@@ o@@ - and num@@ ber@@ -@@ thre@@ e-@@ ra@@ ted tele@@ vision sho@@ ws ."
What &apos;s number one ?
"The soci@@ ally ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent hi@@ p@@ pi@@ e show , &quot; R@@ ow@@ an and Mar@@ tin &apos;s L@@ augh@@ -@@ In . &quot;"
"They &apos;re all living together , right ."
Vi@@ e@@ wers had respon@@ ded dra@@ mati@@ cally .
Lo@@ ok at this green sp@@ ike in 19@@ 6@@ 6 to a be@@ l@@ l@@ we@@ ther show .
"When you guys hear this indus@@ try ter@@ m , a bre@@ ak@@ out h@@ it , what does that mean ?"
"It means in the 19@@ 6@@ 6 tele@@ vision se@@ as@@ on , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mo@@ th@@ ers B@@ ro@@ th@@ ers &quot; &quot; came out of no@@ where ."
"This was the first show that allo@@ wed vie@@ wers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can com@@ ment on how I feel about the Vi@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ m W@@ ar , about the pre@@ si@@ den@@ cy , through tele@@ vision ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a bre@@ ak@@ out show ."
"So then , just like the last char@@ t , look what happens ."
"In 19@@ 70 , the da@@ m bur@@ s@@ ts . The da@@ m bur@@ s@@ ts ."
C@@ om@@ for@@ t is no longer why we wat@@ ch tele@@ vision .
So@@ cial com@@ men@@ tar@@ y and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence ris@@ e thro@@ ugh@@ out the 7@@ 0s .
Now look at this .
The 7@@ 0s means who ? Nor@@ man Le@@ ar .
"You have &quot; &quot; All in the F@@ a@@ mi@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ an@@ for@@ d and S@@ on , &quot; &quot; and the dom@@ in@@ ant show — in the top@@ -@@ 10 for the entire 7@@ 0s — &quot; M@@ A@@ S * H@@ . &quot;"
"In the entire 50 years of tele@@ vision that we stu@@ died , seven of 10 sho@@ ws ran@@ ked most high@@ ly for ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence appe@@ ar@@ ed on air during the Vi@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ m W@@ ar , five of the top@@ -@@ 10 during the N@@ ix@@ on ad@@ min@@ is@@ tra@@ tion ."
"O@@ n@@ ly one gener@@ ation , 20 years in , and we disco@@ vered , W@@ ow ! T@@ V can do that ?"
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
"So to this very , very sav@@ v@@ y cro@@ w@@ d , I also want to n@@ ote the digital fol@@ ks did not inv@@ ent dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tive ."
Ar@@ chi@@ e B@@ un@@ ker was sho@@ ved out of his easy ch@@ air along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
"This is a quic@@ k char@@ t . Here &apos;s another at@@ tribu@@ te : fantas@@ y and ima@@ gin@@ ation , which are sho@@ ws defin@@ ed as , &quot; takes me out of my every@@ day real@@ m &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ma@@ pped against the red do@@ t , u@@ ne@@ m@@ ploy@@ ment , which is a simple B@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u of L@@ ab@@ or D@@ ep@@ ar@@ t@@ ment sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ c ."
"You &apos;ll see that every time fantas@@ y and ima@@ gin@@ ation sho@@ ws ris@@ e , it ma@@ ps to a sp@@ ike in u@@ ne@@ m@@ ploy@@ ment ."
D@@ o we want to see sho@@ ws about people sav@@ ing money and being u@@ ne@@ m@@ ploy@@ ed ?
"N@@ o . In the 7@@ 0s you have the be@@ l@@ l@@ we@@ ther show &quot; &quot; The B@@ ion@@ ic W@@ o@@ man &quot; &quot; that ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ted into the top@@ -@@ 10 in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , follo@@ wed by the &quot; &quot; Si@@ x Mil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ D@@ ol@@ lar M@@ an &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Char@@ li@@ e &apos;s An@@ gel@@ s . &quot; &quot; A@@ no@@ ther sp@@ ike in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s — another sp@@ ike in sho@@ ws about control and power ."
What were those sho@@ ws ?
G@@ la@@ mo@@ ro@@ us and ri@@ ch .
"&quot; D@@ all@@ as , &quot; &quot; F@@ antas@@ y Is@@ land . &quot;"
In@@ cre@@ di@@ ble ma@@ p@@ ping of our national psy@@ ch@@ e with some hard and f@@ ast fac@@ ts : u@@ ne@@ m@@ ploy@@ ment .
"So here you are , in my fav@@ or@@ ite char@@ t , because this is our last 20 years ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther or not you &apos;re in my business , you have su@@ re@@ ly heard or read of the dec@@ line of the thing called the thre@@ e-@@ ca@@ mera sit@@ co@@ m and the ris@@ e of reality T@@ V ."
"Well , as we say in the business , X mar@@ ks the spo@@ t ."
"The 9@@ 0s — the big bu@@ b@@ b@@ les of hu@@ mor — we &apos;re wat@@ ching &quot; &quot; F@@ ri@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ras@@ i@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ e@@ ers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; S@@ e@@ in@@ fel@@ d . &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing &apos;s good , low u@@ ne@@ m@@ ploy@@ ment ."
But look : X mar@@ ks the spo@@ t .
"In 200@@ 1 , the S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 200@@ 1 tele@@ vision se@@ as@@ on , hu@@ mor suc@@ cu@@ m@@ bs to ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment once and for all ."
Why not ?
We had a 2@@ 000 pre@@ si@@ den@@ tial ele@@ ction decided by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
We had the bur@@ s@@ ting of the te@@ ch bu@@ b@@ ble .
We had 9 / 11 .
An@@ th@@ ra@@ x be@@ comes part of the social lex@@ ic@@ on .
Lo@@ ok what happens when we keep going .
"A@@ t the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality tele@@ vision has taken hold ."
What do people want in their T@@ V then ?
I would have thought re@@ ven@@ ge or no@@ st@@ al@@ gia .
Gi@@ ve me some com@@ for@@ t ; my world is f@@ all@@ ing ap@@ art .
"N@@ o , they want ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment ."
I can v@@ ote you off the is@@ land .
I can keep S@@ ar@@ ah P@@ al@@ in &apos;s d@@ aughter dan@@ cing .
I can cho@@ ose the next American I@@ do@@ l . You &apos;re fi@@ red .
"That &apos;s all great , right ?"
"So as dra@@ mati@@ cally different as these tele@@ vision sho@@ ws , pu@@ re en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one bas@@ ic in@@ s@@ tin@@ ct re@@ ma@@ ins ."
"We &apos;re animals , we need our mo@@ ms ."
"There has not been a dec@@ ad@@ e of tele@@ vision without a defin@@ i@@ tive , dom@@ in@@ ant T@@ V mo@@ m ."
"The 19@@ 5@@ 0s : J@@ un@@ e C@@ le@@ ever in the orig@@ in@@ al com@@ for@@ t show , &quot; &quot; Le@@ ave it to Be@@ a@@ ver . &quot; &quot; L@@ uc@@ il@@ le B@@ all kep@@ t us l@@ augh@@ ing through the ris@@ e of social consci@@ ous@@ ness in the 6@@ 0s ."

"The 19@@ 8@@ 0s , our first cou@@ g@@ ar was given to us in the form of A@@ lex@@ is C@@ ar@@ rin@@ g@@ ton ."

"This era &apos;s mo@@ m , B@@ ree V@@ an de K@@ am@@ p ."
"Now I don &apos;t know if this is the de@@ vi@@ l or the an@@ ge@@ l sitting on our con@@ science , sitting on tele@@ vision &apos;s sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders , but I do know that I absolu@@ tely love this image ."
"So to you all , the women of TE@@ D@@ W@@ o@@ men , the men of TE@@ D@@ W@@ o@@ men , the global au@@ di@@ ences of TE@@ D@@ W@@ o@@ men , than@@ k you for le@@ tting me present my idea about the con@@ science of tele@@ vision ."
But let me also than@@ k the incredi@@ ble crea@@ tors who get up every@@ day to put their ideas on our tele@@ vision scre@@ ens thro@@ ugh@@ out all these ages of tele@@ vision .
"They give it life on tele@@ vision , for sure , but it &apos;s you as vie@@ wers , through your colle@@ ctive social consci@@ ences , that give it life , lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity , power or not ."
So than@@ ks very much .
( Applause )
"Well we all know the Wor@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b has absolu@@ tely trans@@ for@@ med pub@@ lis@@ hing , bro@@ ad@@ cas@@ ting , com@@ mer@@ ce and social conne@@ c@@ tivity , but where did it all come from ?"
"And I &apos;ll quot@@ e three people : V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h , D@@ ou@@ g Eng@@ el@@ b@@ art and T@@ i@@ m B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ Le@@ e ."
So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
This is V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h .
V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h was the U.S. government &apos;s chi@@ ef scienti@@ fic ad@@ vis@@ er during the war .
"And in 19@@ 4@@ 5 , he pub@@ lis@@ hed an ar@@ tic@@ le in a mag@@ az@@ ine called A@@ t@@ l@@ anti@@ c M@@ on@@ th@@ ly ."
And the ar@@ tic@@ le was called &quot; &quot; As We M@@ ay Th@@ in@@ k . &quot; &quot; And what V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h was saying was the way we use information is bro@@ k@@ en .
We don &apos;t work in terms of li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies and ca@@ tal@@ o@@ g systems and so for@@ th .
The brain works by as@@ soci@@ ation .
"W@@ ith one ite@@ m in its thought , it s@@ n@@ ap@@ s in@@ stan@@ tly to the next ite@@ m ."
And the way information is struc@@ tu@@ red is to@@ tally in@@ cap@@ able of ke@@ ep@@ ing up with this process .
"And so he sug@@ g@@ es@@ ted a machine , and he called it the me@@ me@@ x ."
"And the me@@ me@@ x would lin@@ k information , one piece of information to a rela@@ ted piece of information and so for@@ th ."
Now this was in 19@@ 4@@ 5 .
A computer in those days was something the se@@ cre@@ t serv@@ ices used to use for co@@ de bre@@ aking .
And no@@ body knew anything about it .
So this was before the computer was inven@@ ted .
And he pro@@ posed this machine called the me@@ me@@ x .
"And he had a pl@@ at@@ form where you lin@@ ked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will ."
"So sp@@ in@@ ning forward , one of the guys who read this ar@@ tic@@ le was a guy called D@@ ou@@ g Eng@@ el@@ b@@ art , and he was a U.S. A@@ i@@ r For@@ ce of@@ fic@@ er ."
And he was read@@ ing it in their li@@ br@@ ary in the F@@ ar E@@ ast .
"And he was so inspi@@ red by this ar@@ tic@@ le , it kind of di@@ re@@ cted the rest of his life ."
"And by the mi@@ d-@@ 6@@ 0s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the S@@ tan@@ for@@ d Re@@ se@@ arch La@@ b in C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia ."
He built a system .
"The system was desig@@ ned to au@@ g@@ ment human intel@@ li@@ gence , it was called ."
"And in a pre@@ mon@@ i@@ tion of today &apos;s world of cl@@ ou@@ d compu@@ ting and so@@ f@@ tw@@ ar@@ es of serv@@ ice , his system was called N@@ L@@ S for o@@ N@@ -@@ L@@ ine S@@ y@@ ste@@ m ."
And this is D@@ ou@@ g Eng@@ el@@ b@@ art .
He was giving a presen@@ tation at the F@@ all Jo@@ in@@ t C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter Con@@ fer@@ ence in 19@@ 6@@ 8 .
"What he sho@@ wed — he s@@ at on a sta@@ ge like this , and he de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ted this system ."
He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
And he works this system .
"And you can see , he &apos;s working between do@@ cu@@ ments and grap@@ h@@ ics and so for@@ th ."
"And he &apos;s dri@@ ving it all with this pl@@ at@@ form here , with a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ fin@@ ger ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard and the world &apos;s first computer m@@ ouse , which he speci@@ ally desig@@ ned in order to do this system ."
So this is where the m@@ ouse came from as well .
So this is D@@ ou@@ g Eng@@ el@@ b@@ art .
The tro@@ u@@ ble with D@@ ou@@ g Eng@@ el@@ b@@ art &apos;s system was that the compu@@ ters in those days cost se@@ ver@@ al million po@@ un@@ ds .
"So for a person@@ al computer , a few million po@@ un@@ ds was like having a person@@ al j@@ et plan@@ e ; it wasn &apos;t really very prac@@ tical ."
"But sp@@ in on to the 8@@ 0s when person@@ al compu@@ ters did ar@@ ri@@ ve , then there was room for this kind of system on person@@ al compu@@ ters ."
"And my company , O@@ W@@ L built a system called G@@ u@@ i@@ de for the Ap@@ ple M@@ ac@@ in@@ to@@ s@@ h ."
And we deli@@ vered the world &apos;s first hy@@ per@@ text system .
And this began to get a head of ste@@ am .
"A@@ p@@ ple in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed a thing called H@@ y@@ per@@ C@@ ard , and they made a bit of a fus@@ s about it ."
They had a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ p@@ age sup@@ ple@@ ment in the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ n@@ al the day it lau@@ n@@ ched .
The mag@@ az@@ ines started to co@@ ver it .
B@@ y@@ te mag@@ az@@ ine and C@@ om@@ m@@ un@@ ic@@ ations at the A@@ C@@ M had speci@@ al issu@@ es co@@ ver@@ ing hy@@ per@@ text .
We developed a P@@ C ver@@ sion of this produc@@ t as well as the M@@ ac@@ in@@ to@@ s@@ h ver@@ sion .
And our P@@ C ver@@ sion became quite ma@@ ture .
These are some exam@@ ples of this system in action in the late 8@@ 0s .
"You were able to deli@@ ver do@@ cu@@ ments , were able to do it over net@@ works ."
We developed a system such that it had a mar@@ k@@ up language based on h@@ t@@ m@@ l .
We called it h@@ m@@ l : hy@@ per@@ text mar@@ k@@ up language .
"And the system was cap@@ able of doing very , very large do@@ cu@@ men@@ tation systems over computer net@@ works ."
So I took this system to a tra@@ de show in V@@ er@@ sa@@ il@@ les ne@@ ar Par@@ is in late No@@ ve@@ m@@ ber 19@@ 90 .
"And I was appro@@ ach@@ ed by a n@@ ice young man called T@@ i@@ m B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ Le@@ e who said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you I@@ an R@@ it@@ chi@@ e ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his pro@@ posed system called the Wor@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b ."
"And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pre@@ ten@@ ti@@ ous name , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally since the whole system ran on his computer in his off@@ ice ."
But he was completely con@@ vin@@ ced that his Wor@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b would take over the world one day .
"And he tried to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e me to write the bro@@ w@@ ser for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any grap@@ h@@ ics or fon@@ ts or la@@ y@@ out or anything ; it was just pl@@ ain text ."
"I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from C@@ E@@ R@@ N , he &apos;s not going to do this ."
So we didn &apos;t do it .
"In the next couple of years , the hy@@ per@@ text community didn &apos;t reco@@ gn@@ ize him either ."
"In 199@@ 2 , his pap@@ er was re@@ je@@ cted for the H@@ y@@ per@@ text Con@@ fer@@ ence ."
"In 199@@ 3 , there was a table at the con@@ fer@@ ence in S@@ e@@ at@@ tle , and a guy called Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ es@@ se@@ n was de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ting his little bro@@ w@@ ser for the Wor@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b ."
"And I saw it , and I thought , ye@@ p , that &apos;s it ."
"And the very next year , in 199@@ 4 , we had the con@@ fer@@ ence here in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh , and I had no op@@ posi@@ tion in having T@@ i@@ m B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ Le@@ e as the ke@@ yn@@ ote spe@@ ak@@ er ."
So that pu@@ ts me in pretty ill@@ us@@ tri@@ ous company .
There was a guy called D@@ ic@@ k R@@ o@@ we who was at De@@ c@@ ca Re@@ cor@@ ds and turned down The Be@@ at@@ les .
"There was a guy called G@@ ary K@@ il@@ d@@ all who went fl@@ ying his plan@@ e when I@@ B@@ M came looking for an oper@@ ating system for the I@@ B@@ M P@@ C , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see B@@ ill G@@ ates ."
"And the 12 pub@@ lis@@ h@@ ers who turned down J@@ .@@ K@@ . R@@ ow@@ ling &apos;s H@@ ar@@ ry P@@ ot@@ ter , I gu@@ ess ."
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ es@@ se@@ n who w@@ ro@@ te the world &apos;s first bro@@ w@@ ser for the Wor@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b ."
"And ac@@ cor@@ ding to For@@ tu@@ ne mag@@ az@@ ine , he &apos;s wor@@ th 7@@ 00 million dollars ."
But is he happy ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
"P@@ ic@@ ture this : It &apos;s M@@ on@@ day mor@@ ning , you &apos;re at the off@@ ice , you &apos;re se@@ t@@ t@@ ling in for the day at work , and this guy that you sort of reco@@ gn@@ ize from down the h@@ all , wal@@ ks right into your cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le and he ste@@ als your ch@@ air ."
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t give you any information about why he took your ch@@ air out of all the other ch@@ air@@ s that are out there .
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t ac@@ knowledge the fact that you might need your ch@@ air to get some work done today .
You wouldn &apos;t stand for it . You &apos;d make a s@@ tin@@ k .
But there &apos;s no ag@@ en@@ da .
"And a wel@@ l@@ -@@ run me@@ e@@ ting can y@@ i@@ el@@ d really posi@@ tive , ac@@ tion@@ able resul@@ ts ."
There are the parti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts who have no idea why they &apos;re there .
It &apos;s kind of fun@@ n@@ y .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) O@@ ur go@@ al today is to come to an ag@@ re@@ e@@ ment on a very important pro@@ pos@@ al .
"As a group , we need to deci@@ de if — bloo@@ p bloo@@ p — H@@ i , who just jo@@ ined ?"
"And three years later , it &apos;s still getting thousands of vie@@ ws every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s close to about a million right now .
&quot; This is my life . &quot;
"E@@ eri@@ ly , s@@ ad@@ ly , de@@ pre@@ ss@@ ing@@ ly true ."
It made me lau@@ gh until I cri@@ ed .
"In fact , the cu@@ re for M@@ A@@ S is right here in our hands ."
"It &apos;s right at our fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps , liter@@ ally ."
It &apos;s something that I call ¡ No M@@ A@@ S !
It &apos;s right next to the ac@@ cept bu@@ t@@ ton .
"Th@@ en , get in to@@ uch with the person who asked you to the me@@ e@@ ting ."
"And if we do this often enough , and we do it re@@ spe@@ c@@ t@@ fully , people might start to be a little bit more thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful about the way they put together me@@ e@@ ting inv@@ it@@ ations ."
And you can make more thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful decis@@ i@@ ons about ac@@ cep@@ ting it .
Pe@@ ople just might start to change their behavior because you changed y@@ ours .
Thank you .
And even blin@@ d bab@@ ies s@@ mil@@ e to the sound of the human voice .
"C@@ an I ask you to ple@@ ase re@@ call a time when you really lo@@ ved something — a movi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a son@@ g or a book — and you re@@ com@@ men@@ ded it wh@@ o@@ le@@ hear@@ te@@ dly to someone you also really lik@@ ed , and you anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted that re@@ action , you w@@ ai@@ ted for it , and it came back , and the person ha@@ ted it ?"
"So , by way of in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school ma@@ th ."
"I se@@ ll a produc@@ t to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ ced by la@@ w to bu@@ y it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a lo@@ sing pro@@ posi@@ tion ."
"So there &apos;s a u@@ se@@ ful ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about students that I see , a u@@ se@@ ful ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about you all ."
"I could give you guys an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would expe@@ ct no high@@ er than a 25 percent pas@@ s rate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call ma@@ th education in the U.S. today .
"To start with , I &apos;d like to bre@@ ak ma@@ th down into two ca@@ te@@ gor@@ ies ."
One is compu@@ tation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ tor@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ tics with lead@@ ing co@@ ef@@ fici@@ ents gre@@ ater than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , provi@@ ded you have a really st@@ rong gro@@ un@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the ap@@ plic@@ ation of ma@@ th pro@@ ces@@ ses to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathe@@ mati@@ cal fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.S@@ ."
all but en@@ sur@@ es they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a ma@@ th teach@@ er ."
"So first , five sym@@ pto@@ ms that you &apos;re doing ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your clas@@ s@@ room ."
One is a l@@ ack of in@@ iti@@ a@@ tive ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your le@@ c@@ ture blo@@ ck and im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely you have five hands going up as@@ king you to re@@ -@@ expl@@ ain the entire thing at their de@@ sk@@ s .
S@@ tu@@ dents l@@ ack per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
"They l@@ ack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find yourself re@@ -@@ expl@@ ain@@ ing con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ o@@ le@@ sal@@ e ."
"There &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ sion to word problems , which descri@@ bes 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the for@@ mu@@ la to ap@@ ply in that sit@@ u@@ ation .
This is really de@@ struc@@ tive .
"D@@ a@@ vi@@ d Mil@@ ch , cre@@ ato@@ r of &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ wo@@ od &quot; &quot; and other amazing T@@ V sho@@ ws , has a really good descri@@ ption for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary dra@@ ma , sho@@ ws set in the present day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ re@@ spe@@ ct , it shap@@ es the neu@@ ral path@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they expe@@ ct simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an im@@ pati@@ ence with ir@@ re@@ solution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re im@@ pati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t re@@ solve quickly ."
"You expe@@ ct sit@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three com@@ mer@@ cial bre@@ ak@@ s and a lau@@ gh tra@@ ck ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and wel@@ l@@ -@@ being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our te@@ x@@ t@@ books — particu@@ lar@@ ly mas@@ s@@ -@@ a@@ do@@ p@@ ted te@@ x@@ t@@ books — te@@ ach ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ally e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and c@@ all@@ ing it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a physi@@ cs te@@ x@@ t@@ book .
It ap@@ pli@@ es equ@@ ally to ma@@ th .
"N@@ oti@@ ce , first of all here , that you have exactly three pie@@ ces of information there , each of which will figure into a for@@ mu@@ la some@@ where , ev@@ en@@ tually , which the stu@@ dent will then compu@@ te ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the given information in advan@@ ce ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ pl@@ us of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have su@@ f@@ fici@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the te@@ x@@ t@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s ha@@ m@@ str@@ ing@@ ing students because , wat@@ ch this , this is the prac@@ tice problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ w@@ ap@@ ping out numbers and twe@@ aking the con@@ text a little bit ."
"And if the stu@@ dent still doesn &apos;t reco@@ gn@@ ize the sta@@ m@@ p this was mo@@ l@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ fully expl@@ ain@@ s to you what s@@ am@@ ple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the for@@ mu@@ la ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , pas@@ s this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any physi@@ cs , just kno@@ wing how to de@@ co@@ de a te@@ x@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a s@@ ha@@ me ."
So I can diagno@@ se the problem a little more speci@@ fic@@ ally in ma@@ th .
Here &apos;s a really co@@ ol problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ pe using a sk@@ i li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers , and I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers and , particu@@ lar@@ ly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pres@@ sed together and presen@@ ted to the stu@@ dent all at once , how that cre@@ ates this im@@ pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll defin@@ e them here : You have the vis@@ ual .
"You also have the mathe@@ mati@@ cal struc@@ ture , talking about gri@@ ds , measu@@ re@@ ments , la@@ be@@ ls , poin@@ ts , ax@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ ste@@ ps , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which se@@ ction is the ste@@ ep@@ est ."
So I hope you can see .
"I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compe@@ l@@ ling question , a compe@@ l@@ ling answer , but we &apos;re pa@@ ving a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , stra@@ i@@ ght pa@@ th from one to the other and con@@ gra@@ tu@@ la@@ ting our students for how well they can step over the small cra@@ cks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the vis@@ ual , and I im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely ask the question : Wh@@ ich se@@ ction is the ste@@ ep@@ est ?"
And this star@@ ts con@@ vers@@ ation because the vis@@ ual is created in such a way where you can de@@ f@@ end two ans@@ wers .
"So you get people argu@@ ing against each other , friend ver@@ su@@ s friend , in pair@@ s , jour@@ n@@ al@@ ing , whatever ."
And then ev@@ en@@ tually we realize it &apos;s getting an@@ noy@@ ing to talk about the sk@@ i@@ er in the lo@@ wer le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the sk@@ i@@ er just ab@@ o@@ ve the mi@@ d line .
"And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D la@@ be@@ ls to talk about them more eas@@ i@@ ly ."
"And then as we start to defin@@ e what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realize it would be n@@ ice to have some measu@@ re@@ ments to really nar@@ row it down , speci@@ fic@@ ally what that means ."
"And then and only then , we thro@@ w down that mathe@@ mati@@ cal struc@@ ture ."
"The ma@@ th ser@@ ves the con@@ vers@@ ation , the con@@ vers@@ ation doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the ma@@ th ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 clas@@ ses are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ pe , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then develo@@ p those sub@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"D@@ o you guys see how this , right here , com@@ par@@ ed to that — which one cre@@ ates that pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , that ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been obvi@@ ous in my prac@@ tice , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ i@@ el@@ d the flo@@ or here for a second to E@@ in@@ ste@@ in , who , I believe , has pai@@ d his du@@ es ."
"He tal@@ ked about the for@@ mu@@ lation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my prac@@ tice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t invol@@ ve them in the for@@ mu@@ lation of the problem ."
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fai@@ r@@ ly compe@@ l@@ ling ele@@ ments of problems like this from my te@@ x@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that sup@@ por@@ ts ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tan@@ k .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ ir@@ st things first , we eli@@ min@@ ate all the sub@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents have to develo@@ p those , they have to for@@ mu@@ late those ."
And then no@@ tice that all the information w@@ rit@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"N@@ one of it &apos;s a dis@@ tra@@ c@@ tor , so we lo@@ se that ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents need to deci@@ de , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the h@@ eight matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the co@@ lor of the val@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; S@@ uch an under@@ re@@ presen@@ ted question in ma@@ th cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m .
So now we have a water tan@@ k .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or cli@@ p art that you so often see in te@@ x@@ t@@ books , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone fil@@ ling it up ."
"And it &apos;s fil@@ ling up s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ dents are looking at their wat@@ ches , ro@@ l@@ ling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve b@@ ai@@ ted the ho@@ ok , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fu@@ n for me because , like the in@@ tro , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a con@@ vers@@ ation about ma@@ th because someone else has the for@@ mu@@ la ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the for@@ mu@@ la better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stu@@ dent is on a level pla@@ ying field of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion ."
"E@@ very@@ one &apos;s fil@@ led something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are mathe@@ mati@@ cally and con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion@@ ally in@@ ti@@ mi@@ da@@ ted jo@@ in@@ ing the con@@ vers@@ ation ."
"We put n@@ ames on the bo@@ ard , atta@@ ch them to gu@@ es@@ ses , and kids have b@@ ou@@ ght in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve descri@@ bed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teach@@ er &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion ."
"We , instead , just wat@@ ch the end of the movi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terri@@ f@@ ying , because the theor@@ e@@ tical mode@@ ls that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teach@@ er &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s s@@ car@@ y to talk about sour@@ ces of er@@ ro@@ r when the theor@@ e@@ tical does not mat@@ ch up with the prac@@ tical ."
"But those con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions have been so val@@ u@@ able , a@@ mon@@ g the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ port some really fu@@ n g@@ ames with students who come pre@@ -@@ in@@ st@@ al@@ led with these vi@@ rus@@ es day one of the clas@@ s .
"Th@@ ese are the kids who now , one se@@ me@@ s@@ ter in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , to@@ tally new , to@@ tally for@@ ei@@ g@@ n , and they &apos;ll have a con@@ vers@@ ation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fu@@ n ."
"We &apos;re no longer a@@ verse to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ ti@@ mi@@ da@@ ted by ma@@ th , because we &apos;re s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ defin@@ ing what ma@@ th is ."
This has been a lot of fu@@ n .
"I en@@ cou@@ rag@@ e ma@@ th teach@@ ers I talk to to use mul@@ ti@@ media , because it b@@ rin@@ gs the real world into your clas@@ s@@ room in high re@@ solution and full co@@ lor ; to en@@ cou@@ rag@@ e stu@@ dent in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion for that level pla@@ ying field ; to ask the shor@@ test question you possi@@ bly can and let those more speci@@ fic questions come out in con@@ vers@@ ation ; to let students build the problem , because E@@ in@@ ste@@ in said so ; and to finally , in to@@ tal , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the te@@ x@@ t@@ book is hel@@ ping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ lig@@ ation , for pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving and ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an amazing time to be a ma@@ th teach@@ er right now is because we have the tools to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m in our front po@@ c@@ ke@@ t .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qui@@ to@@ us and fai@@ r@@ ly che@@ ap , and the tools to dis@@ tribu@@ te it fre@@ ely under open li@@ cen@@ ses has also never been che@@ ap@@ er or more u@@ bi@@ qui@@ to@@ us ."
"I put a video ser@@ ies on my blo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vie@@ ws in two we@@ eks ."
"I get ema@@ il@@ s still from teach@@ ers in countries I &apos;ve never visi@@ ted saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ ah . We had a good con@@ vers@@ ation about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow ."
"I put this problem on my blo@@ g re@@ cen@@ tly : In a gro@@ cer@@ y sto@@ re , which line do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 1@@ 9 ite@@ ms or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one ite@@ ms ."
"And the lin@@ e@@ ar mode@@ ling invol@@ ved in that was some good stuff for my clas@@ s@@ room , but it ev@@ en@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; Go@@ od M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few we@@ eks later , which is just b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ clu@@ de that people , not just students , are really hun@@ g@@ ry for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the vo@@ c@@ ab@@ u@@ lar@@ y for your own in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion .
"So I just really en@@ cou@@ rag@@ e you , whatever your sta@@ ke is in education — whether you &apos;re a stu@@ dent , par@@ ent , teach@@ er , poli@@ cy mak@@ er , whatever — in@@ sis@@ t on better ma@@ th cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m ."
We need more pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
"In@@ ter@@ pre@@ ter : P@@ i@@ ano , &quot; &quot; p , &quot; &quot; is my fav@@ or@@ ite mu@@ si@@ cal sym@@ bo@@ l ."
It means to play so@@ f@@ tly .
T@@ w@@ o p &apos;s — even so@@ f@@ ter .
F@@ our p &apos;s — extre@@ me@@ ly so@@ ft .
So it has a history of about 200 years .
"I was born de@@ a@@ f , and I was tau@@ ght to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life ."
And I beli@@ ev@@ ed it to be true .
"@@ Y@@ et , I realize now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all ."
So how is it that I understand sound ?
"You people are like my l@@ ou@@ d@@ spe@@ ak@@ ers , and am@@ pli@@ f@@ y sound ."
"Th@@ us I &apos;ve learned , for example ..@@ ."
&quot; D@@ on &apos;t make too much no@@ ise when you &apos;re e@@ ating from the po@@ ta@@ to@@ -@@ chi@@ p ba@@ g ! &quot;
"T@@ B@@ D , to be decided ."
"T@@ B@@ C , to be contin@@ u@@ ed ."
"T@@ B@@ A , to be an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced ."
"In De@@ a@@ f culture , movement is e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent to sound ."
This is a sig@@ n for &quot; &quot; sta@@ ff &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
"P@@ ri@@ or to this time , I had been working as a pain@@ ter ."
"A@@ t that time , sound was tr@@ en@@ ding , and this struc@@ k me ..@@ ."
Now sound has come into my art terri@@ tory .
I@@ s it going to fu@@ r@@ ther dis@@ tance me from art ?
I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
I started cre@@ ating a new body of work .
I ch@@ ose to be em@@ power@@ ed .
There &apos;s a mas@@ sive culture around spo@@ k@@ en language .
"And that way , I &apos;m able to main@@ tain rele@@ van@@ cy in society today ."
And their voice be@@ comes my voice and identi@@ ty .
They help me to be heard .
And their vo@@ ices hold val@@ ue and cur@@ ren@@ cy .
And I was surpris@@ ed to see the si@@ mil@@ ari@@ ties between music and A@@ S@@ L .
And the same h@@ ol@@ ds true for a con@@ cept in A@@ S@@ L .
A@@ S@@ L is bro@@ k@@ en down into many different gram@@ mati@@ cal para@@ me@@ ters .
"The same ap@@ pli@@ es to music in re@@ gar@@ ds to p@@ it@@ ch , ton@@ e and vol@@ u@@ me ."
I &apos;m looking at you .
S@@ tar@@ ing at you .
U@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h .
What are you looking at ?
"A@@ w , stop ."
All ... day .
"This is A@@ L@@ L@@ -@@ N@@ I@@ G@@ H@@ T , re@@ presen@@ ted in this dra@@ wing ."
We have the sta@@ ff across the head and the ch@@ est .
"E@@ very@@ body , hands up ."
"@@ Yes , got it ."
That means &quot; &quot; to f@@ all in love &quot; &quot; in In@@ ter@@ national &#91; S@@ ig@@ n &#93; .
And now this .
This is &quot; &quot; col@@ on@@ ization &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
And again .
This is &quot; &quot; en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
"&quot; F@@ all in love , &quot; &quot; col@@ on@@ ization &quot; and &quot; &quot; en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot; &quot; Go@@ od job , everyone ."
And this could possi@@ bly be a step to le@@ ad to a more inclu@@ sive society .
( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ ro C@@ or@@ po@@ ra@@ tion of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of plas@@ tic with a R@@ a@@ dio S@@ h@@ ack an@@ ten@@ na at@@ tach@@ ed to it .
So that &apos;s just a fu@@ n little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ or@@ t of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing com@@ pati@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a B@@ u@@ ic@@ k hu@@ b@@ c@@ ap , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ c@@ ap ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ ali@@ leo , he had two problems when he turned his tele@@ s@@ co@@ pe to Sa@@ turn ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the side of a g@@ las@@ s win@@ do@@ w in S@@ ao P@@ au@@ lo .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
"@@ Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the bac@@ k@@ side , which they started to wi@@ pe off ."
I was born and ra@@ is@@ ed in Nor@@ th Kor@@ ea .
"A@@ l@@ though my family con@@ stan@@ tly str@@ ug@@ g@@ led against po@@ ver@@ ty , I was always lo@@ ved and car@@ ed for first , because I was the only son and the youn@@ gest of two in the family ."
But then the great f@@ am@@ ine began in 199@@ 4 .
I was four years old .
My sis@@ ter and I would go se@@ arch@@ ing for fi@@ re@@ wo@@ od star@@ ting at 5 in the mor@@ ning and come back after mi@@ d@@ night .
"I would wan@@ der the stre@@ ets se@@ arch@@ ing for food , and I remember seeing a small child ti@@ ed to a mother &apos;s back e@@ ating chi@@ ps , and wan@@ ting to ste@@ al them from him ."
H@@ un@@ ger is hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation . H@@ un@@ ger is ho@@ pe@@ le@@ ss@@ ness .
"For a hun@@ g@@ ry child , poli@@ tics and fre@@ e@@ dom are not even thought of ."
"O@@ n my n@@ in@@ th bir@@ th@@ day , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to e@@ at ."
"But even as a child , I could feel the he@@ av@@ in@@ ess in their hear@@ ts ."
"O@@ ver a million Nor@@ th Kor@@ e@@ ans died of star@@ v@@ ation in that time , and in 200@@ 3 , when I was 1@@ 3 years old , my father became one of them ."
I saw my father wi@@ ther away and die .
"In the same year , my mother dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed one day , and then my sis@@ ter told me that she was going to China to ear@@ n money , but that she would re@@ turn with money and food so@@ on ."
"S@@ in@@ ce we had never been se@@ para@@ ted , and I thought we would be together for@@ ever , I didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g when she left ."
It was the big@@ gest mis@@ take I have ever made in my life .
"But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long go@@ od@@ by@@ e ."
I have not seen my mo@@ m or my sis@@ ter since then .
"S@@ u@@ d@@ den@@ ly , I became an or@@ ph@@ an and ho@@ me@@ less ."
"My dai@@ ly life became very hard , but very simple ."
My go@@ al was to find a dus@@ ty piece of bre@@ ad in the tr@@ as@@ h .
But that is no way to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
"I started to realize , beg@@ ging would not be the solution ."
So I started to ste@@ al from food car@@ ts in il@@ leg@@ al marke@@ ts .
"S@@ ome@@ times , I found small j@@ ob@@ s in ex@@ change for food ."
"O@@ n@@ ce , I even spent two months in the win@@ ter working in a co@@ al min@@ e , 3@@ 3 me@@ ters un@@ d@@ erg@@ ro@@ und without any prote@@ ction for up to 1@@ 6 hours a day ."
I was not un@@ common .
"M@@ any other or@@ ph@@ ans sur@@ vi@@ ved this way , or wor@@ se ."
"When I could not f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep from b@@ it@@ ter col@@ d or hun@@ ger pa@@ ins , I ho@@ ped that , the next mor@@ ning , my sis@@ ter would come back to w@@ ake me up with my fav@@ or@@ ite food ."
That hope kep@@ t me ali@@ ve .
"I don &apos;t mean big , g@@ r@@ and hope ."
"I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next tr@@ as@@ h can had bre@@ ad , even though it usu@@ ally didn &apos;t ."
"But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die ."
H@@ o@@ pe kep@@ t me ali@@ ve .
"E@@ very day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live ."
"A@@ f@@ ter three years of w@@ ai@@ ting for my sis@@ ter &apos;s re@@ turn , I decided to go to China to look for her myself ."
I realized I couldn &apos;t sur@@ vi@@ ve much longer this way .
"I knew the jour@@ ney would be ris@@ k@@ y , but I would be ris@@ king my life either way ."
"I could die of star@@ v@@ ation like my father in Nor@@ th Kor@@ ea , or at least I could try for a better life by es@@ cap@@ ing to China ."
I had learned that many people tried to cro@@ ss the bor@@ der to China in the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time to av@@ o@@ id being seen .
Nor@@ th Kor@@ ean bor@@ der gu@@ ar@@ ds often sho@@ ot and k@@ ill people trying to cro@@ ss the bor@@ der without per@@ mis@@ sion .
"@@ Ch@@ in@@ ese sol@@ di@@ ers will c@@ at@@ ch and sen@@ d back Nor@@ th Kor@@ e@@ ans , where they face se@@ v@@ ere p@@ un@@ is@@ h@@ ment ."
"I decided to cro@@ ss during the day , first because I was still a ki@@ d and s@@ car@@ ed of the dar@@ k , second because I knew I was already taking a ris@@ k , and since not many people tried to cro@@ ss during the day , I thought I might be able to cro@@ ss without being seen by any@@ one ."
"I made it to China on F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary 15 , 200@@ 6 ."
I was 1@@ 6 years old .
"I thought things in China would be eas@@ i@@ er , since there was more food ."
I thought more people would help me .
"But it was har@@ der than living in Nor@@ th Kor@@ ea , because I was not free ."
I was always wor@@ ried about being cau@@ ght and s@@ ent back .
"B@@ y a mi@@ ra@@ cle , some months later , I met someone who was run@@ ning an un@@ d@@ erg@@ ro@@ und sh@@ el@@ ter for Nor@@ th Kor@@ e@@ ans , and was allo@@ wed to live there and e@@ at re@@ gu@@ lar me@@ als for the first time in many years ."
"L@@ ater that year , an ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ t hel@@ ped me es@@ cap@@ e China and go to the United States as a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ."
"I went to America without kno@@ wing a word of Eng@@ lish , yet my social wor@@ ker told me that I had to go to high school ."
"E@@ ven in Nor@@ th Kor@@ ea , I was an F stu@@ dent ."
( Laughter ) And I b@@ are@@ ly fin@@ is@@ hed ele@@ men@@ tar@@ y school .
And I remember I f@@ ou@@ ght in school more than once a day .
T@@ ex@@ t@@ books and the li@@ br@@ ary were not my play@@ ground .
"My father tried very hard to motiv@@ ate me into stu@@ dy@@ ing , but it didn &apos;t work ."
"A@@ t one point , my father gave up on me ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son any@@ more . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it hu@@ r@@ t me de@@ ep@@ ly ."
"But ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , my level of motiv@@ ation still didn &apos;t change before he died ."
"So in America , it was kind of ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous that they said I should go to high school ."
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
"I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much ."
"But one day , I came home and my f@@ os@@ ter mother had made ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en win@@ gs for din@@ ner ."
"And during din@@ ner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it ."
"When I looked down at my pl@@ ate , I saw the last ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en wing , that my f@@ os@@ ter father had given me his ."
I was so happy .
I looked at him sitting next to me .
"He just looked back at me very war@@ m@@ ly , but said no words ."
Su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I remem@@ ber@@ ed my bi@@ olog@@ ical father .
"My f@@ os@@ ter father &apos;s small act of love re@@ min@@ ded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hun@@ g@@ ry , even if he was star@@ ving ."
"I felt so su@@ f@@ fo@@ c@@ ated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of star@@ v@@ ation ."
"My only w@@ ish that night was to co@@ ok a me@@ al for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to hon@@ or him ."
And my answer was to pro@@ mis@@ e to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to hon@@ or his s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice .
"I took school ser@@ i@@ ously , and for the first time ever in my life , I rec@@ ei@@ ved an ac@@ ade@@ mic a@@ ward for ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ence , and made de@@ an &apos;s lis@@ t from the first se@@ me@@ s@@ ter in high school ."
( Applause ) That ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en wing changed my life .
( Laughter ) H@@ o@@ pe is person@@ al . H@@ o@@ pe is something that no one can give to you .
You have to cho@@ ose to believe in hope .
You have to make it yourself .
"In Nor@@ th Kor@@ ea , I made it myself ."
H@@ o@@ pe bro@@ ught me to America .
"But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"My f@@ os@@ ter father at that din@@ ner gave me a di@@ re@@ ction , and he motiv@@ ated me and gave me a pur@@ pose to live in America ."
I did not come here by myself .
"I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough ."
M@@ any people hel@@ ped me along the way to get here .
Nor@@ th Kor@@ e@@ ans are fi@@ gh@@ ting hard to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
"They have to for@@ ce themselves to sur@@ vi@@ ve , have hope to sur@@ vi@@ ve , but they cannot make it without help ."
This is my mess@@ age to you .
"H@@ ave hope for yourself , but also help each other ."
"L@@ i@@ fe can be hard for everyone , wh@@ er@@ ever you live ."
My f@@ os@@ ter father didn &apos;t in@@ ten@@ d to change my life .
"In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the sm@@ al@@ le@@ st act of love ."
"A piece of bre@@ ad can sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y your hun@@ ger , and having the hope will bring you bre@@ ad to keep you ali@@ ve ."
But I con@@ fi@@ den@@ tly believe that your act of love and car@@ ing can also sa@@ ve another Jo@@ se@@ p@@ h &apos;s life and change thousands of other Jo@@ se@@ ph@@ s who are still having hope to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) A@@ dri@@ an H@@ on@@ g : Jo@@ se@@ p@@ h , than@@ k you for shar@@ ing that very person@@ al and speci@@ al story with us ."
"I know you ha@@ ven &apos;t seen your sis@@ ter for , you said , it was almost exactly a dec@@ ad@@ e , and in the off chan@@ ce that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to sen@@ d her a mess@@ age ."
Jo@@ se@@ p@@ h K@@ i@@ m : In Kor@@ ean ?
"A@@ H : You can do Eng@@ lish , then Kor@@ ean as well ."
"( Laughter ) J@@ K : Okay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in Kor@@ ean because I don &apos;t think I can make it without te@@ ar@@ ing up ."
"N@@ u@@ na , it has been already 10 years that I ha@@ ven ’ t seen you ."
"I just wanted to say that I mis@@ s you , and I love you , and ple@@ ase come back to me and sta@@ y ali@@ ve ."
"And I — o@@ h , g@@ os@@ h ."
I still ha@@ ven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
"I will live my life hap@@ pi@@ ly and study hard until I see you , and I pro@@ mis@@ e I will not c@@ ry again ."
"( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day ."
And can I also make a small mess@@ age to my mo@@ m ?
"A@@ H : Su@@ re , ple@@ ase ."
"@@ J@@ K : I ha@@ ven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pra@@ y for me and think about me ."
I just wanted to say than@@ k you for le@@ tting me be in this world .
Thank you .
( Applause )
How many of you had to f@@ ill out some sort of we@@ b form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a dis@@ tor@@ ted sequ@@ ence of charac@@ ters like this ?
"@@ How many of you found it really , really an@@ noy@@ ing ?"
"O@@ kay , out@@ standing . So I inven@@ ted that ."
( Laughter ) O@@ r I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
"And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the enti@@ ty fil@@ ling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was w@@ rit@@ ten to sub@@ m@@ it the form mil@@ lions and mil@@ lions of times ."
"The reason it works is because humans , at least non@@ -@@ vis@@ u@@ all@@ y@@ -@@ im@@ pai@@ red humans , have no tro@@ u@@ ble read@@ ing these dis@@ tor@@ ted squ@@ ig@@ g@@ ly charac@@ ters , wh@@ ere@@ as computer progra@@ ms simply can &apos;t do it as well yet ."
"So for example , in the case of T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ mas@@ ter , the reason you have to ty@@ pe these dis@@ tor@@ ted charac@@ ters is to pre@@ v@@ ent scal@@ per@@ s from wri@@ ting a program that can bu@@ y mil@@ lions of tic@@ ke@@ ts , two at a time ."
C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As are used all over the Internet .
"And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the pre@@ c@@ ise sequ@@ ence of ran@@ dom charac@@ ters that is sho@@ wn to the u@@ ser is not so for@@ tun@@ ate ."
So this is an example from the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o re@@ g@@ is@@ tra@@ tion p@@ age .
"The ran@@ dom charac@@ ters that happened to be sho@@ wn to the u@@ ser were W , A , I , T , which , of course , spe@@ ll a word ."
But the best part is the mess@@ age that the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o help des@@ k got about 20 minutes later .
"T@@ ex@@ t : &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ p ! I &apos;ve been w@@ ai@@ ting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wa@@ it ."
"This of course , is not as bad as this po@@ or person ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A Pro@@ ject is something that we did here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ el@@ l@@ lon over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used every@@ where ."
"L@@ et me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evol@@ ution of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"This is a project that we call re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , which is something that we started here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ el@@ lon , then we turned it into a star@@ tu@@ p company ."
"And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually ac@@ qui@@ red this company ."
So let me tell you what this project started .
So this project started from the follo@@ wing real@@ ization : It turns out that appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 200 million C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As are ty@@ ped every@@ day by people around the world .
"When I first heard this , I was quite pro@@ u@@ d of myself ."
"I thought , look at the imp@@ act that my research has had ."
But then I started feel@@ ing bad .
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , each time you ty@@ pe a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally you was@@ te 10 secon@@ ds of your time ."
"And if you mul@@ ti@@ ply that by 200 million , you get that human@@ ity as a whole is was@@ ting about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 hours every day ty@@ ping these an@@ noy@@ ing C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As ."
So then I started feel@@ ing bad .
"( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get ri@@ d of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As , because the se@@ cur@@ ity of the W@@ e@@ b sort of depen@@ ds on them ."
"But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this ef@@ for@@ t for something that is good for human@@ ity ?"
"So see , here &apos;s the thing ."
"Wh@@ ile you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , during those 10 secon@@ ds , your brain is doing something amazing ."
Y@@ our brain is doing something that compu@@ ters cannot yet do .
So can we get you to do u@@ se@@ ful work for those 10 secon@@ ds ?
"A@@ no@@ ther way of pu@@ tting it is , is there some hu@@ mon@@ g@@ ous problem that we cannot yet get compu@@ ters to solve , yet we can s@@ pli@@ t into tin@@ y 10@@ -@@ second ch@@ un@@ ks such that each time somebody sol@@ ves a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A they solve a little bit of this problem ?"
"And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; y@@ es , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now ."
"So what you may not know is that no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys while you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , not only are you au@@ th@@ enti@@ c@@ ating yourself as a human , but in ad@@ di@@ tion you &apos;re actually hel@@ ping us to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books ."
So let me expl@@ ain how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of pro@@ jects out there trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books .
Google has one . The Internet Ar@@ chi@@ ve has one .
"A@@ maz@@ on , now with the Kin@@ d@@ le , is trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books ."
B@@ as@@ ically the way this works is you start with an old book .
"You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? L@@ ike a book ?"
"( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you s@@ can it ."
Now s@@ can@@ ning a book is like taking a digital photograp@@ h of every p@@ age of the book .
It gi@@ ves you an image for every p@@ age of the book .
This is an image with text for every p@@ age of the book .
The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to deci@@ ph@@ er all of the words in this image .
"That &apos;s using a technology called O@@ C@@ R , for op@@ tical charac@@ ter reco@@ g@@ ni@@ tion , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there ."
Now the problem is that O@@ C@@ R is not per@@ fect .
"E@@ speci@@ ally for ol@@ der books where the in@@ k has fa@@ ded and the pag@@ es have turned y@@ el@@ low , O@@ C@@ R cannot reco@@ gn@@ ize a lot of the words ."
"For example , for things that were w@@ rit@@ ten more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot reco@@ gn@@ ize about 30 percent of the words ."
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot reco@@ gn@@ ize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A on the Internet .
"So the next time you ty@@ pe a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , these words that you &apos;re ty@@ ping are actually words that are coming from books that are being di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ed that the computer could not reco@@ gn@@ ize ."
"And now the reason we have two words no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you ."
"But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot gra@@ de it for you ."
"So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer ."
"We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , ple@@ ase ty@@ pe both ."
"And if you ty@@ pe the cor@@ re@@ ct word for the one for which the system already kno@@ ws the answer , it as@@ su@@ mes you are human , and it also gets some con@@ fi@@ dence that you ty@@ ped the other word cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And if we re@@ pe@@ at this process to like 10 different people and all of them ag@@ ree on what the new word is , then we get one more word di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ed ac@@ cu@@ ra@@ tely ."
So this is how the system works .
"And basically , since we rele@@ as@@ ed it about three or four years ago , a lot of w@@ eb@@ s@@ ites have started s@@ wit@@ ching from the old C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people was@@ ted their time to the new C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people are hel@@ ping to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books ."
"So for example , T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ mas@@ ter ."
"So every time you bu@@ y tic@@ ke@@ ts on T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ mas@@ ter , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"F@@ ace@@ book : E@@ very time you ad@@ d a friend or po@@ ke somebody , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"T@@ wit@@ ter and about 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 other s@@ ites are all using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"And in fact , the number of s@@ ites that are using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ing per day is really , really large ."
"It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of about two and a half million books a year ."
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people ty@@ ping C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As on the Internet .
"( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , fun@@ n@@ y things can happen ."
And this is es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally true because now we &apos;re giving people two ran@@ dom@@ ly cho@@ se@@ n Eng@@ lish words next to each other .
So fun@@ n@@ y things can happen .
"For example , we presen@@ ted this word ."
It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Chris@@ ti@@ ans &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
"But if you present it along with another ran@@ dom@@ ly cho@@ se@@ n word , bad things can happen ."
"So we get this . ( T@@ ex@@ t : bad ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ ans ) But it &apos;s even wor@@ se , because the particular w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite where we sho@@ wed this actually happened to be called The E@@ m@@ bas@@ s@@ y of the K@@ ing@@ dom of God ."
( Laughter ) O@@ op@@ s . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
Jo@@ h@@ n@@ E@@ d@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m ( T@@ ex@@ t : D@@ am@@ n li@@ ber@@ al ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on in@@ sul@@ ting people left and right every@@ day .
"Now , of course , we &apos;re not just in@@ sul@@ ting people ."
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re presen@@ ting two ran@@ dom@@ ly cho@@ se@@ n words , interesting things can happen ."
"So this actually has given ris@@ e to a really big Internet me@@ me that ten@@ s of thousands of people have parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted in , which is called C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A art ."
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
"I@@ ma@@ gine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A that you think is some@@ what pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , like this C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A . ( T@@ ex@@ t : in@@ visi@@ ble to@@ as@@ ter ) Th@@ en what you &apos;re sup@@ posed to do is you take a scre@@ en sho@@ t of it ."
"Th@@ en of course , you f@@ ill out the C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A because you help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"But then , first you take a scre@@ en sho@@ t , and then you dra@@ w something that is rela@@ ted to it ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
There are ten@@ s of thousands of these .
S@@ ome of them are very cu@@ te . ( T@@ ex@@ t : c@@ len@@ ched it ) ( Laughter ) S@@ ome of them are fun@@ ni@@ er .
"( T@@ ex@@ t : sto@@ ned f@@ oun@@ ders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like pal@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ log@@ ical sh@@ vis@@ le , they con@@ tain S@@ no@@ o@@ p D@@ og@@ g . ( Laughter )"
"O@@ kay , so this is my fav@@ or@@ ite number of re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
So this is the fav@@ or@@ ite thing that I like about this whole project .
"This is the number of dis@@ tin@@ ct people that have hel@@ ped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze at least one word out of a book through re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A : 7@@ 50 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has hel@@ ped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human knowledge ."
And it is numbers like these that motiv@@ ate my research ag@@ en@@ da .
"So the question that motiv@@ ates my research is the follo@@ wing : If you look at human@@ ity &apos;s lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale ach@@ i@@ ev@@ e@@ ments , these really big things that human@@ ity has g@@ ot@@ ten together and done h@@ isto@@ ri@@ cally — like for example , building the p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds of E@@ gy@@ pt or the P@@ ana@@ ma C@@ an@@ al or pu@@ tting a man on the Mo@@ on — there is a cu@@ ri@@ ous fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people ."
"It &apos;s w@@ ei@@ r@@ d ; they were all done with about 10@@ 0,000 people ."
"And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , co@@ ordin@@ ating more than 10@@ 0,000 people , let alone pa@@ ying them , was es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally im@@ possible ."
"But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just sho@@ wn you a project where we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten 7@@ 50 million people to help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human knowledge ."
"So the question that motiv@@ ates my research is , if we can put a man on the Mo@@ on with 10@@ 0,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?"
"So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different pro@@ jects that we &apos;ve been working on ."
Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most exci@@ ted about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been se@@ mi@@ -@@ qui@@ e@@ tly working on for the last year and a half or so .
It h@@ as@@ n &apos;t yet been lau@@ n@@ ched . It &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"S@@ in@@ ce it h@@ as@@ n &apos;t been lau@@ n@@ ched , sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h !"
"( Laughter ) Yeah , I can tr@@ ust you &apos;ll do that ."
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
"It started with me pos@@ ing a question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ dent , S@@ e@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ ker ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s S@@ e@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ ker ."
So I posed the question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ dent .
"B@@ y the way , you did hear me cor@@ rec@@ tly ; his last name is H@@ ac@@ ker ."
So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people trans@@ la@@ ting the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free ?
"O@@ kay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , trans@@ la@@ ting the W@@ e@@ b ."
So right now the W@@ e@@ b is parti@@ tion@@ ed into mul@@ ti@@ ple langu@@ ages .
A large fra@@ ction of it is in Eng@@ lish .
"If you don &apos;t know any Eng@@ lish , you can &apos;t access it ."
"But there &apos;s large fra@@ ctions in other different langu@@ ages , and if you don &apos;t know those langu@@ ages , you can &apos;t access it ."
"So I would like to trans@@ late all of the W@@ e@@ b , or at least most of the W@@ e@@ b , into every maj@@ or language ."
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
"Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use compu@@ ters to trans@@ late ?"
Why can &apos;t we use machine trans@@ lation ?
M@@ ach@@ ine trans@@ lation no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys is star@@ ting to trans@@ late some sen@@ ten@@ ces here and there .
Why can &apos;t we use it to trans@@ late the whole W@@ e@@ b ?
Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
It makes a lot of mis@@ takes .
"E@@ ven when it doesn &apos;t make a mis@@ take , since it makes so many mis@@ takes , you don &apos;t know whether to tr@@ ust it or not ."
So let me show you an example of something that was trans@@ la@@ ted with a machine .
A@@ c@@ tually it was a for@@ um po@@ st .
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt .
It was trans@@ la@@ ted from J@@ apan@@ ese into Eng@@ lish .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
This person star@@ ts apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ z@@ ing for the fact that it &apos;s trans@@ la@@ ted with a computer .
So the next sen@@ t@@ ence is is going to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to the question .
So he &apos;s just expl@@ ain@@ ing something .
"@@ Re@@ mem@@ ber , it &apos;s a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : A@@ t often , the go@@ at@@ -@@ time in@@ st@@ all a er@@ ro@@ r is v@@ om@@ it . ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes the first part of the question ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : How many times like the win@@ d , a po@@ le , and the d@@ rag@@ on ? ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes my fav@@ or@@ ite part of the question ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : This in@@ sul@@ t to father &apos;s sto@@ n@@ es ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the en@@ ding , which is my fav@@ or@@ ite part of the whole thing ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : P@@ le@@ ase apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze for your stu@@ pi@@ d@@ ity . There are a many than@@ k you . ) ( Laughter ) Okay , so computer trans@@ lation , not yet good enough ."
So back to the question .
So we need people to trans@@ late the whole W@@ e@@ b .
"So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just p@@ ay people to do this ?"
We could p@@ ay pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ al language trans@@ la@@ tors to trans@@ late the whole W@@ e@@ b .
We could do that .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ na@@ tely , it would be extre@@ me@@ ly ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
"For example , trans@@ la@@ ting a tin@@ y , tin@@ y fra@@ ction of the whole W@@ e@@ b , W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia , into one other language , S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia exis@@ ts in S@@ pan@@ ish , but it &apos;s very small com@@ par@@ ed to the size of Eng@@ lish ."
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of Eng@@ lish .
"If we wanted to trans@@ late the other 80 percent into S@@ pan@@ ish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most ex@@ plo@@ i@@ ted , out@@ sour@@ cing country out there ."
So it would be very ex@@ pen@@ sive .
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people trans@@ la@@ ting the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free .
"Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hu@@ r@@ d@@ les , two big ob@@ sta@@ c@@ les ."
The first one is a l@@ ack of bil@@ in@@ gu@@ als .
So I don &apos;t even know if there exis@@ ts 100 million people out there using the W@@ e@@ b who are bil@@ in@@ gu@@ al enough to help us trans@@ late .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a l@@ ack of motiv@@ ation .
How are we going to motiv@@ ate people to actually trans@@ late the W@@ e@@ b for free ?
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , you have to p@@ ay people to do this ."
So how are we going to motiv@@ ate them to do it for free ?
"Now when we were star@@ ting to think about this , we were blo@@ c@@ ked by these two things ."
"But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution ."
There &apos;s a way to k@@ ill two bir@@ ds with one sto@@ ne .
"And that is to trans@@ form language trans@@ lation into something that mil@@ lions of people want to do , and that also hel@@ ps with the problem of l@@ ack of bil@@ in@@ gu@@ als , and that is language education ."
"So it turns out that today , there are over 1@@ .@@ 2 billion people learning a for@@ ei@@ g@@ n language ."
"P@@ e@@ ople really , really want to learn a for@@ ei@@ g@@ n language ."
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being for@@ ced to do so in school .
"For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have pai@@ d over $ 500 for so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to learn a new language ."
"So people really , really want to learn a new language ."
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite — it &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go — where the bas@@ ic idea is people learn a new language for free while si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously trans@@ la@@ ting the W@@ e@@ b .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
"So the way this works is wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re a just a begin@@ ner , we give you very , very simple sen@@ ten@@ ces ."
"There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sen@@ ten@@ ces on the W@@ e@@ b ."
"We give you very , very simple sen@@ ten@@ ces along with what each word means ."
"And as you trans@@ late them , and as you see how other people trans@@ late them , you start learning the language ."
"And as you get more and more advan@@ ced , we give you more and more complex sen@@ ten@@ ces to trans@@ late ."
"But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing ."
Now the cra@@ z@@ y thing about this meth@@ od is that it actually really works .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , people are really , really learning a language ."
"We &apos;re mo@@ st@@ ly done building it , and now we &apos;re tes@@ ting it ."
Pe@@ ople really can learn a language with it .
And they learn it about as well as the lead@@ ing language learning so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
So people really do learn a language .
"And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting ."
"Because you see with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , people are actually learning with real con@@ tent ."
"As op@@ posed to learning with ma@@ de@@ -@@ up sen@@ ten@@ ces , people are learning with real con@@ tent , which is in@@ her@@ ently interesting ."
So people really do learn a language .
"But perhaps more surpris@@ ing@@ ly , the trans@@ la@@ tions that we get from people using the s@@ ite , even though they &apos;re just begin@@ ners , the trans@@ la@@ tions that we get are as ac@@ cu@@ rate as those of pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ al language trans@@ la@@ tors , which is very surpris@@ ing ."
So let me show you one example .
This is a sen@@ t@@ ence that was trans@@ la@@ ted from Ger@@ man into Eng@@ lish .
The top is the Ger@@ man .
The middle is an Eng@@ lish trans@@ lation that was done by somebody who was a pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ al Eng@@ lish trans@@ la@@ tor who we pai@@ d 20 cen@@ ts a word for this trans@@ lation .
"And the bot@@ to@@ m is a trans@@ lation by us@@ ers of D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , n@@ one of wh@@ om knew any Ger@@ man before they started using the s@@ ite ."
"You can see , it &apos;s pretty much per@@ fect ."
"Now of course , we play a tri@@ ck here to make the trans@@ la@@ tions as good as pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ al language trans@@ la@@ tors ."
We com@@ b@@ ine the trans@@ la@@ tions of mul@@ ti@@ ple begin@@ ners to get the qu@@ ality of a single pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ al trans@@ la@@ tor .
"Now even though we &apos;re com@@ b@@ in@@ ing the trans@@ la@@ tions , the s@@ ite actually can trans@@ late pretty f@@ ast ."
"So let me show you , this is our esti@@ ma@@ tes of how f@@ ast we could trans@@ late W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia from Eng@@ lish into S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"@@ Re@@ mem@@ ber , this is 50 million dollar@@ s@@ -@@ wor@@ th of val@@ ue ."
"So if we wanted to trans@@ late W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia into S@@ pan@@ ish , we could do it in five we@@ eks with 10@@ 0,000 ac@@ tive us@@ ers ."
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million ac@@ tive us@@ ers .
"S@@ in@@ ce all the pro@@ jects that my group has worked on so far have g@@ ot@@ ten mil@@ lions of us@@ ers , we &apos;re ho@@ pe@@ ful that we &apos;ll be able to trans@@ late extre@@ me@@ ly f@@ ast with this project ."
Now the thing that I &apos;m most exci@@ ted about with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think this provi@@ des a fai@@ r business model for language education .
"So here &apos;s the thing : The cur@@ r@@ ent business model for language education is the stu@@ dent pa@@ ys , and in particular , the stu@@ dent pa@@ ys R@@ o@@ se@@ t@@ ta S@@ ton@@ e 500 dollars ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the cur@@ r@@ ent business model .
The problem with this business model is that 9@@ 5 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
So it &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly un@@ fai@@ r to@@ wards the po@@ or .
This is to@@ tally bi@@ as@@ ed to@@ wards the ri@@ ch .
"Now see , in D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , because while you learn you &apos;re actually cre@@ ating val@@ ue , you &apos;re trans@@ la@@ ting stuff — which for example , we could char@@ ge somebody for trans@@ la@@ tions ."
So this is how we could mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze this .
"S@@ in@@ ce people are cre@@ ating val@@ ue while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to p@@ ay their money , they p@@ ay with their time ."
"But the mag@@ ical thing here is that they &apos;re pa@@ ying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent any@@ ways learning the language ."
So the n@@ ice thing about D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think it provi@@ des a fai@@ r business model — one that doesn &apos;t dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ate against po@@ or people .
So here &apos;s the s@@ ite . Thank you .
( Applause ) So here &apos;s the s@@ ite .
"We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet lau@@ n@@ ched , but if you go there , you can sig@@ n up to be part of our p@@ riv@@ ate be@@ ta , which is probably going to start in about three or four we@@ eks ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet lau@@ n@@ ched this D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"B@@ y the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is the work of a really aw@@ es@@ ome team , some of wh@@ om are here ."
So than@@ k you .
( Applause )
"In O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , there was a fantas@@ tic doc@@ tor , who was very un@@ usu@@ al , na@@ med A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ war@@ t ."
"And A@@ li@@ ce was un@@ usu@@ al par@@ tly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty r@@ are in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s ."
"And she was bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant , she was one of the , at the time , the youn@@ gest F@@ el@@ low to be ele@@ cted to the R@@ oy@@ al C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge of P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans ."
"She was un@@ usu@@ al too because she contin@@ u@@ ed to work after she got mar@@ ried , after she had kids , and even after she got di@@ v@@ or@@ ced and was a single par@@ ent , she contin@@ u@@ ed her medi@@ cal work ."
"And she was un@@ usu@@ al because she was really interested in a new science , the e@@ mer@@ ging field of epi@@ de@@ mi@@ o@@ logy , the study of patter@@ ns in disease ."
"But like every scienti@@ st , she ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated that to make her mar@@ k , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it ."
The hard problem that A@@ li@@ ce ch@@ ose was the ris@@ ing in@@ ci@@ dence of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od can@@ c@@ ers .
"M@@ os@@ t disease is cor@@ rela@@ ted with po@@ ver@@ ty , but in the case of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od can@@ c@@ ers , the children who were dy@@ ing see@@ med mo@@ st@@ ly to come from af@@ flu@@ ent fami@@ lies ."
"So , what , she wanted to know , could expl@@ ain this an@@ om@@ al@@ y ?"
"Now , A@@ li@@ ce had tro@@ u@@ ble getting fun@@ ding for her research ."
"In the end , she got just 1@@ ,000 po@@ un@@ ds from the L@@ ad@@ y T@@ ata Me@@ mor@@ i@@ al pri@@ ze ."
And that me@@ ant she knew she only had one sho@@ t at colle@@ cting her data .
"Now , she had no idea what to look for ."
"This really was a ne@@ ed@@ le in a ha@@ y@@ sta@@ ck sort of se@@ arch , so she asked everything she could think of ."
H@@ ad the children e@@ a@@ ten bo@@ i@@ led s@@ we@@ ets ?
H@@ ad they con@@ su@@ med col@@ or@@ ed d@@ rin@@ ks ?
Di@@ d they e@@ at fish and chi@@ ps ?
Di@@ d they have in@@ do@@ or or out@@ do@@ or pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
"And when her car@@ b@@ on co@@ pi@@ ed ques@@ tion@@ n@@ ai@@ re started to come back , one thing and one thing only j@@ um@@ ped out with the sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cal c@@ lar@@ ity of a kind that most scientists can only dre@@ am of ."
"B@@ y a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mo@@ th@@ ers who had been X@@ -@@ ra@@ y@@ ed when pre@@ gn@@ ant ."
Now that fin@@ ding fle@@ w in the face of con@@ ven@@ tional w@@ is@@ dom .
"C@@ on@@ ven@@ tional w@@ is@@ dom hel@@ d that everything was saf@@ e up to a point , a thre@@ sh@@ old ."
"It fle@@ w in the face of con@@ ven@@ tional w@@ is@@ dom , which was huge en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m for the co@@ ol new technology of that age , which was the X@@ -@@ ra@@ y machine ."
"And it fle@@ w in the face of doc@@ tors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who hel@@ ped pati@@ ents , they didn &apos;t har@@ m them ."
"N@@ e@@ ver@@ the@@ less , A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ war@@ t rus@@ hed to pub@@ lish her pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary fin@@ din@@ gs in The L@@ an@@ c@@ et in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"P@@ e@@ ople got very exci@@ ted , there was talk of the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze , and A@@ li@@ ce really was in a big hu@@ r@@ ry to try to study all the cas@@ es of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od cancer she could find before they dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed ."
"In fact , she need not have hu@@ r@@ ried ."
It was fully 25 years before the B@@ ri@@ tis@@ h and medi@@ cal — B@@ ri@@ tis@@ h and American medi@@ cal es@@ tab@@ lis@@ h@@ ments ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed the prac@@ tice of X@@ -@@ ra@@ ying pre@@ gn@@ ant women .
"The data was out there , it was open , it was fre@@ ely av@@ ail@@ able , but no@@ body wanted to know ."
"A child a week was dy@@ ing , but nothing changed ."
O@@ pen@@ ness alone can &apos;t dri@@ ve change .
So for 25 years A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ war@@ t had a very big fi@@ ght on her hands .
"So , how did she know that she was right ?"
"Well , she had a fantas@@ tic model for thinking ."
"She worked with a sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ an na@@ med G@@ e@@ or@@ ge K@@ ne@@ al@@ e , and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge was pretty much everything that A@@ li@@ ce wasn &apos;t ."
"So , A@@ li@@ ce was very out@@ going and soci@@ able , and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge was a rec@@ lu@@ se ."
"A@@ li@@ ce was very war@@ m , very em@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with her pati@@ ents ."
G@@ e@@ or@@ ge f@@ ran@@ kly pre@@ fer@@ red numbers to people .
But he said this fantas@@ tic thing about their working relation@@ ship .
"He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to pro@@ ve D@@ r. S@@ te@@ war@@ t wrong . &quot; &quot; He ac@@ tively s@@ ou@@ ght dis@@ con@@ fir@@ ma@@ tion ."
"Di@@ f@@ fer@@ ent ways of looking at her mode@@ ls , at her sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs , different ways of c@@ run@@ ching the data in order to dis@@ pro@@ ve her ."
He saw his job as cre@@ ating con@@ fli@@ ct around her theor@@ ies .
"Because it was only by not being able to pro@@ ve that she was wrong , that G@@ e@@ or@@ ge could give A@@ li@@ ce the con@@ fi@@ dence she needed to know that she was right ."
It &apos;s a fantas@@ tic model of col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation — thinking par@@ t@@ ners who ar@@ en &apos;t echo cham@@ bers .
"I won@@ der how many of us have , or d@@ are to have , such col@@ lab@@ ora@@ tors ."
A@@ li@@ ce and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge were very good at con@@ fli@@ ct .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of con@@ struc@@ tive con@@ fli@@ ct re@@ qui@@ re ?
"Well , first of all , it re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es that we find people who are very different from ourselves ."
"That means we have to res@@ ist the neuro@@ bi@@ olog@@ ical dri@@ ve , which means that we really pre@@ fer people mo@@ st@@ ly like ourselves , and it means we have to see@@ k out people with different bac@@ k@@ gro@@ un@@ ds , different dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to eng@@ age with them ."
That re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es a lot of pati@@ ence and a lot of energy .
"And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love ."
Because you simply won &apos;t comm@@ it that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
And it also means that we have to be pre@@ par@@ ed to change our min@@ ds .
"A@@ li@@ ce &apos;s d@@ aughter told me that every time A@@ li@@ ce went head@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ head with a fel@@ low scienti@@ st , they made her think and think and think again ."
"&quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t en@@ j@@ oy a fi@@ ght , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one relation@@ ship ."
"But it str@@ ikes me that the big@@ gest problems we face , many of the big@@ gest dis@@ as@@ ters that we &apos;ve experi@@ en@@ ced , mo@@ st@@ ly ha@@ ven &apos;t come from individu@@ als , they &apos;ve come from organ@@ iz@@ ations , some of them big@@ ger than countries , many of them cap@@ able of af@@ fe@@ cting hundre@@ ds , thousands , even mil@@ lions of lives ."
So how do organ@@ iz@@ ations think ?
"Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t ."
"And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t ."
And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too af@@ ra@@ id of con@@ fli@@ ct .
"In sur@@ ve@@ ys of Euro@@ pe@@ an and American exe@@ cu@@ tives , fully 8@@ 5 percent of them ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged that they had issu@@ es or con@@ cer@@ ns at work that they were af@@ ra@@ id to ra@@ ise ."
"A@@ fra@@ id of the con@@ fli@@ ct that that would pro@@ vo@@ ke , af@@ ra@@ id to get em@@ bro@@ i@@ led in argu@@ ments that they did not know how to man@@ age , and felt that they were b@@ ound to lo@@ se ."
Ei@@ gh@@ ty@@ -@@ five percent is a really big number .
It means that organ@@ iz@@ ations mo@@ st@@ ly can &apos;t do what G@@ e@@ or@@ ge and A@@ li@@ ce so tri@@ um@@ ph@@ an@@ tly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
"And it means that people like many of us , who have run organ@@ iz@@ ations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mo@@ st@@ ly fai@@ l to get the best out of them ."
So how do we develo@@ p the sk@@ il@@ ls that we need ?
"Because it does take sk@@ ill and prac@@ tice , too ."
"If we ar@@ en &apos;t going to be af@@ ra@@ id of con@@ fli@@ ct , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it ."
"So , re@@ cen@@ tly , I worked with an exe@@ cu@@ tive na@@ med Jo@@ e , and Jo@@ e worked for a medi@@ cal dev@@ ice company ."
And Jo@@ e was very wor@@ ried about the dev@@ ice that he was working on .
He thought that it was too com@@ plic@@ ated and he thought that its comple@@ x@@ ity created mar@@ gin@@ s of er@@ ro@@ r that could really hu@@ r@@ t people .
He was af@@ ra@@ id of doing da@@ ma@@ ge to the pati@@ ents he was trying to help .
"But when he looked around his organ@@ ization , no@@ body else see@@ med to be at all wor@@ ried ."
"So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t ."
M@@ ay@@ be he &apos;d look stu@@ pi@@ d .
"But he kep@@ t wor@@ r@@ ying about it , and he wor@@ ried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he lo@@ ved ."
"In the end , Jo@@ e and I found a way for him to ra@@ ise his con@@ cer@@ ns ."
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this sit@@ u@@ ation .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts .
So now Jo@@ e had alli@@ es . They could think together .
"And y@@ es , there was a lot of con@@ fli@@ ct and de@@ b@@ ate and argu@@ ment , but that allo@@ wed everyone around the table to be crea@@ tive , to solve the problem , and to change the dev@@ ice ."
"@@ Jo@@ e was what a lot of people might think of as a wh@@ is@@ t@@ le@@ -@@ blo@@ wer , ex@@ cept that like almost all wh@@ is@@ t@@ le@@ -@@ blo@@ wers , he wasn &apos;t a c@@ ran@@ k at all , he was pas@@ sion@@ a@@ tely dev@@ ot@@ ed to the organ@@ ization and the high@@ er pur@@ pos@@ es that that organ@@ ization ser@@ ved ."
"But he had been so af@@ ra@@ id of con@@ fli@@ ct , until finally he became more af@@ ra@@ id of the sil@@ ence ."
"And when he dar@@ ed to speak , he disco@@ vered much more inside h@@ im@@ self and much more give in the system than he had ever ima@@ gin@@ ed ."
And his colle@@ ag@@ ues don &apos;t think of him as a c@@ ran@@ k .
They think of him as a le@@ a@@ der .
"So , how do we have these con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions more eas@@ i@@ ly and more often ?"
"Well , the Uni@@ versity of D@@ el@@ ft re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es that its P@@ h@@ D students have to sub@@ m@@ it five sta@@ te@@ ments that they &apos;re pre@@ par@@ ed to de@@ f@@ end ."
"It doesn &apos;t really matter what the sta@@ te@@ ments are about , what mat@@ ters is that the can@@ di@@ da@@ tes are wil@@ ling and able to stand up to au@@ thor@@ ity ."
"I think it &apos;s a fantas@@ tic system , but I think le@@ av@@ ing it to P@@ h@@ D can@@ di@@ da@@ tes is far too few people , and way too late in life ."
"I think we need to be teach@@ ing these sk@@ il@@ ls to kids and ad@@ ul@@ ts at every sta@@ ge of their develo@@ pment , if we want to have thinking organ@@ iz@@ ations and a thinking society ."
The fact is that most of the big@@ gest ca@@ tas@@ tro@@ ph@@ es that we &apos;ve wit@@ ne@@ s@@ sed r@@ are@@ ly come from information that is se@@ cre@@ t or h@@ id@@ den .
"It comes from information that is fre@@ ely av@@ ail@@ able and out there , but that we are w@@ ill@@ fully blin@@ d to , because we can &apos;t h@@ and@@ le , don &apos;t want to h@@ and@@ le , the con@@ fli@@ ct that it pro@@ vo@@ kes ."
"But when we d@@ are to bre@@ ak that sil@@ ence , or when we d@@ are to see , and we create con@@ fli@@ ct , we en@@ able ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking ."
"O@@ pen information is fantas@@ tic , open net@@ works are es@@ sen@@ tial ."
But the tru@@ th won &apos;t set us free until we develo@@ p the sk@@ il@@ ls and the ha@@ bit and the tal@@ ent and the mor@@ al cou@@ rag@@ e to use it .
O@@ pen@@ ness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .

"T@@ w@@ o years ago , I sto@@ od on the TED sta@@ ge in A@@ rus@@ h@@ a , T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia ."
I spo@@ ke very bri@@ ef@@ ly about one of my pro@@ u@@ de@@ st cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .

I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
"O@@ n the sta@@ ge that day , I was so ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"My Eng@@ lish lost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by so many az@@ un@@ g@@ u , wh@@ ite people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feel@@ ing good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"A@@ ll sis@@ ters , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my d@@ ad when I was a little bo@@ y .
"B@@ e@@ fore I disco@@ vered the won@@ ders of science , I was just a simple far@@ mer in a country of po@@ or far@@ mers ."
"L@@ ike everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ ize ."
One year our for@@ tu@@ ne turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we experi@@ en@@ ced an aw@@ ful f@@ am@@ ine .
W@@ ith@@ in five months all M@@ al@@ a@@ wi@@ ans began to star@@ ve to death .
"My family ate one me@@ al per day , at night ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ w@@ allo@@ ws of n@@ si@@ ma for each one of us .
The food pas@@ ses through our bo@@ dies .
We dro@@ p down to nothing .
"In M@@ al@@ aw@@ i , the secon@@ d@@ ary school , you have to p@@ ay school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the hun@@ ger , I was for@@ ced to dro@@ p out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I felt very happy to be at the secon@@ d@@ ary school , so I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to rec@@ ei@@ ve education ."
So I went to a li@@ br@@ ary .
"I read books , science books , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally physi@@ cs ."
I couldn &apos;t read Eng@@ lish that well .
I used diag@@ ra@@ ms and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that knowledge in my hands .
It said a win@@ d@@ mil@@ l could pu@@ m@@ p water and gener@@ ate electri@@ city .
"P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , a de@@ f@@ en@@ se against hun@@ ger , which we were experi@@ en@@ cing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one win@@ d@@ mil@@ l for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a s@@ cra@@ p y@@ ard where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , inclu@@ ding my mother , said I was cra@@ z@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) I found a tra@@ c@@ tor f@@ an , sho@@ ck ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ pes ."
"U@@ sing a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle fra@@ me and an old b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle dy@@ na@@ mo , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four li@@ ghts , with s@@ wit@@ ches , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it bre@@ ak@@ er , mode@@ led after an electri@@ c be@@ ll ."
A@@ no@@ ther machine pu@@ m@@ ps water for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .
Q@@ u@@ eu@@ es of people start lin@@ ing up at my house ( Laughter ) to char@@ ge their mo@@ bil@@ e phone .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the re@@ por@@ ters came too , which le@@ ad to b@@ log@@ g@@ ers and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an air@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ lep@@ t in a h@@ ot@@ el .
"So , on sta@@ ge that day in A@@ rus@@ h@@ a , my Eng@@ lish lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Afri@@ c@@ ans , and the po@@ or who are str@@ ug@@ g@@ ling with your dre@@ am@@ s ."
God b@@ less .
M@@ ay@@ be one day you will wat@@ ch this on the Internet .
"I say to you , tr@@ ust yourself and believe ."
"W@@ ha@@ te@@ ver happens , don &apos;t give up ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"In the 19@@ 8@@ 0s in the commun@@ ist E@@ as@@ ter@@ n Ger@@ many , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ wri@@ ter , you had to re@@ g@@ is@@ ter it with the government ."
You had to re@@ g@@ is@@ ter a s@@ am@@ ple sh@@ e@@ et of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ wri@@ ter .
And this was done so the government could tra@@ ck where text was coming from .
"If they found a pap@@ er which had the wrong kind of thought , they could tra@@ ck down who created that thought ."
"And we in the W@@ est couldn &apos;t understand how any@@ body could do this , how much this would re@@ stri@@ ct fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ e@@ ch ."
We would never do that in our own countries .
"But today in 20@@ 11 , if you go and bu@@ y a co@@ lor las@@ er prin@@ ter from any maj@@ or las@@ er prin@@ ter man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ re@@ r and prin@@ t a p@@ age , that p@@ age will end up having s@@ light y@@ el@@ low d@@ ots prin@@ ted on every single p@@ age in a patter@@ n which makes the p@@ age uni@@ qu@@ e to you and to your prin@@ ter ."
This is happening to us today .
And no@@ body see@@ ms to be making a fus@@ s about it .
"And this is an example of the ways that our own govern@@ ments are using technology against us , the ci@@ tiz@@ ens ."
And this is one of the ma@@ in three sour@@ ces of on@@ line problems today .
"If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the on@@ line world , we can group the atta@@ cks based on the atta@@ ck@@ ers ."
We have three ma@@ in gro@@ up@@ s .
We have on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als .
"L@@ ike here , we have M@@ r. D@@ im@@ it@@ ry G@@ ol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of K@@ i@@ e@@ v in U@@ kra@@ ine ."
And the mo@@ tives of on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
"They use on@@ line atta@@ cks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it ."
"We actually have se@@ ver@@ al cas@@ es of mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res on@@ line , mul@@ ti@@ mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res , who made money with their atta@@ cks ."
Here &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ mi@@ r T@@ s@@ as@@ ts@@ in form T@@ ar@@ t@@ u in E@@ sto@@ nia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z .
This is S@@ te@@ ph@@ en W@@ at@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ di@@ n .
"This is M@@ at@@ the@@ w An@@ der@@ son , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ D@@ a@@ our and so on and so on ."
"Th@@ ese guys make their for@@ tun@@ es on@@ line , but they make it through the il@@ leg@@ al means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts while we do on@@ line ban@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ log@@ g@@ ers to colle@@ ct our cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d information while we are doing on@@ line sho@@ p@@ ping from an in@@ fe@@ cted computer ."
"The U.S. S@@ e@@ cre@@ t S@@ er@@ v@@ ice , two months ago , fro@@ ze the S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t of M@@ r. S@@ am J@@ ain right here , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was fro@@ z@@ en ."
M@@ r. J@@ ain h@@ im@@ self is on the loo@@ se ; no@@ body kno@@ ws where he is .
And I cl@@ ai@@ m it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more lik@@ ely for any of us to become the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of a cri@@ me on@@ line than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvi@@ ous that this is only going to get wor@@ se .
"In the future , the maj@@ or@@ ity of cri@@ me will be happening on@@ line ."
The second maj@@ or group of atta@@ ck@@ ers that we are wat@@ ching today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
"They &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else — motiv@@ ated by pro@@ tes@@ ts , motiv@@ ated by an op@@ in@@ ion , motiv@@ ated by the l@@ augh@@ s ."
G@@ ro@@ up@@ s like An@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a maj@@ or play@@ er in the field of on@@ line atta@@ cks .
"So those are the three ma@@ in atta@@ ck@@ ers : cri@@ min@@ als who do it for the money , h@@ ac@@ k@@ ti@@ vis@@ ts like An@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous doing it for the prote@@ st , but then the last group are n@@ ation sta@@ tes , govern@@ ments doing the atta@@ cks ."
And then we look at cas@@ es like what happened in Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a pri@@ me example of what happens when govern@@ ments atta@@ ck against their own ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
"Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate Au@@ thor@@ ity from The Ne@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds — or actually , it was ."
It was run@@ ning into ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ cy last f@@ all because they were h@@ ac@@ ked into .
S@@ ome@@ body bro@@ ke in and they h@@ ac@@ ked it th@@ o@@ ro@@ ugh@@ ly .
"And I asked last week in a me@@ e@@ ting with D@@ u@@ t@@ ch government re@@ presen@@ ta@@ tives , I asked one of the lead@@ ers of the team whether he found pl@@ au@@ si@@ ble that people died because of the Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar h@@ ack ."
And his answer was y@@ es .
So how do people die as the resul@@ t of a h@@ ack like this ?
Well Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .@@ A@@ .
They se@@ ll cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
"Well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite that has h@@ t@@ t@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted serv@@ ices , serv@@ ices like G@@ ma@@ il ."
"Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ ma@@ il or one of their compe@@ ti@@ tors , but these serv@@ ices are es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally popu@@ lar in to@@ tal@@ it@@ ari@@ an sta@@ tes like I@@ ran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use for@@ ei@@ g@@ n serv@@ ices like G@@ ma@@ il because they know they are more tr@@ us@@ t@@ wor@@ th@@ y than the local serv@@ ices and they are en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L conne@@ ctions , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ o@@ p on their dis@@ cus@@ sions ."
Ex@@ cept they can if they h@@ ack into a for@@ ei@@ g@@ n C@@ .@@ A@@ .
and issu@@ e ro@@ gu@@ e cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
"What about A@@ ra@@ b S@@ p@@ ring and things that have been happening , for example , in E@@ gy@@ pt ?"
"Well in E@@ gy@@ pt , the ri@@ oter@@ s lo@@ ot@@ ed the head@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of the E@@ gy@@ p@@ ti@@ an se@@ cre@@ t poli@@ ce in Ap@@ ri@@ l 20@@ 11 , and when they were loo@@ ting the building they found lots of pap@@ ers ."
"A@@ mon@@ g those pap@@ ers , was this b@@ in@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And within that b@@ in@@ der were n@@ otes from a company based in Ger@@ many which had sol@@ d the E@@ gy@@ p@@ ti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting — and in very large scale — all the communic@@ ation of the ci@@ tiz@@ ens of the country ."
"They had sol@@ d this to@@ ol for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 Eu@@ ros to the E@@ gy@@ p@@ ti@@ an government ."
The company head@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters are right here .
So W@@ ester@@ n govern@@ ments are provi@@ ding to@@ tal@@ it@@ ari@@ an govern@@ ments with tools to do this against their own ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
But W@@ ester@@ n govern@@ ments are doing it to themselves as well .
"For example , in Ger@@ many , just a couple of we@@ eks ago the so@@ -@@ called Sta@@ te T@@ ro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by Ger@@ man government of@@ fici@@ als to inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ate their own ci@@ tiz@@ ens ."
"If you are a su@@ spe@@ ct in a cri@@ min@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous , your phone will be tap@@ ped ."
"But today , it goes be@@ y@@ ond that ."
They will ta@@ p your Internet conne@@ ction .
"They will even use tools like Sta@@ te T@@ ro@@ j@@ an to in@@ fect your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ab@@ les them to wat@@ ch all your communic@@ ation , to lis@@ ten to your on@@ line dis@@ cus@@ sions , to colle@@ ct your pas@@ s@@ words ."
"Now when we think de@@ ep@@ er about things like these , the obvi@@ ous respon@@ se from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that soun@@ ds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really af@@ fect me because I &apos;m a leg@@ al ci@@ tiz@@ en ."
Why should I wor@@ ry ?
"Because I have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot; &quot; And this is an argu@@ ment , which doesn &apos;t make sense ."
P@@ riv@@ ac@@ y is im@@ pli@@ ed .
P@@ riv@@ ac@@ y is not up for dis@@ cus@@ sion .
This is not a question between p@@ riv@@ ac@@ y against se@@ cur@@ ity .
It &apos;s a question of fre@@ e@@ dom against control .
"And while we might tr@@ ust our govern@@ ments right now , right here in 20@@ 11 , any right we give away will be given away for good ."
"And do we tr@@ ust , do we blin@@ dly tr@@ ust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?"
And these are the questions that we have to wor@@ ry about for the next 50 years .
We re@@ tain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ j@@ oy@@ ing m@@ un@@ d@@ ane soun@@ ds .
"This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble d@@ ry@@ er ."
"Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life ."
( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to speak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ ues .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally under@@ sto@@ od that questions of mor@@ ality — questions of good and evi@@ l and right and wrong — are questions about which science of@@ fici@@ ally has no op@@ in@@ ion ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we val@@ ue , but it can never tell us what we ou@@ ght to val@@ ue ."
"And , con@@ sequ@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th dy@@ ing for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ stitu@@ tes a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to argu@@ e that this is an il@@ lu@@ sion — that the se@@ par@@ ation between science and human val@@ ues is an il@@ lu@@ sion — and actually quite a dang@@ er@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ ues see@@ m to be@@ long to different sp@@ her@@ es ."
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ ption of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ou@@ ght to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ ues are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the wel@@ l@@ -@@ being of consci@@ ous crea@@ tures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have eth@@ ical ob@@ lig@@ ations to@@ ward ro@@ cks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel com@@ passion for ro@@ cks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ cks can su@@ f@@ fer . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our fel@@ low pri@@ ma@@ tes than we are about in@@ se@@ cts , as in@@ de@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ posed to a gre@@ ater ran@@ ge of poten@@ tial hap@@ pin@@ ess and su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing ."
"Now , the c@@ ru@@ cial thing to no@@ tice here is that this is a fac@@ tual cl@@ ai@@ m : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed the relation@@ ship between bi@@ olog@@ ical comple@@ x@@ ity and the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ se@@ cts ."
"And there &apos;s no no@@ tion , no ver@@ sion of human mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about consci@@ ous experience and its possible changes ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ ues from reli@@ gion , even if you think that good and evi@@ l ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely rela@@ te to condi@@ tions after death — either to an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of hap@@ pin@@ ess with God or an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about consci@@ ous@@ ness and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can per@@ sis@@ t after death is itself a fac@@ tual cl@@ ai@@ m , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to speak about the condi@@ tions of wel@@ l@@ -@@ being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a contin@@ u@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fai@@ led state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mo@@ th@@ ers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where str@@ ang@@ ers cannot find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ace@@ ful col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation , where people are mu@@ r@@ der@@ ed in@@ dis@@ cri@@ min@@ a@@ tely ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this contin@@ u@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more i@@ dy@@ l@@ lic , to a place where a con@@ fer@@ ence like this is even con@@ c@@ ei@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ wers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ era to the water be a good idea ?
Pro@@ b@@ ably not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evi@@ l ey@@ e , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely bl@@ ame their n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ s ? Pro@@ b@@ ably not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human comm@@ uni@@ ties fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And mor@@ ality rela@@ tes to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ ues we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our sit@@ u@@ ation in the world can be under@@ sto@@ od at many le@@ vel@@ s — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic systems and political ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human wel@@ l@@ -@@ being we are , of ne@@ cess@@ ity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ ic@@ i@@ de b@@ om@@ ber does get 7@@ 2 vir@@ gin@@ s in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his person@@ ality — his rather un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate person@@ ality — is the produc@@ t of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tribu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as in@@ de@@ ed it does , it changes us by chan@@ ging our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ e@@ fore whatever cul@@ tural vari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h can , at least in prin@@ ci@@ ple , be under@@ sto@@ od in the con@@ text of a ma@@ tur@@ ing science of the mind — neuro@@ science , psy@@ cho@@ logy , e@@ t@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m argu@@ ing is that val@@ ue &apos;s re@@ duc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the consci@@ ous experience of consci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can ther@@ e@@ fore vis@@ u@@ al@@ ize a space of possible changes in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a mor@@ al lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e , with pe@@ ak@@ s and val@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ res@@ po@@ nd to differ@@ ences in the wel@@ l@@ -@@ being of consci@@ ous crea@@ tures , both person@@ al and colle@@ ctive ."
"And one thing to no@@ tice is that perhaps there are sta@@ tes of human wel@@ l@@ -@@ being that we r@@ are@@ ly access , that few people access ."
And these a@@ wa@@ it our disco@@ very .
Per@@ haps some of these sta@@ tes can be appro@@ pri@@ a@@ tely called my@@ sti@@ cal or spi@@ rit@@ ual .
Per@@ haps there are other sta@@ tes that we can &apos;t access because of how our min@@ ds are struc@@ tu@@ red but other min@@ ds possi@@ bly could access them .
"Now , let me be cle@@ ar about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to ma@@ p this space , or that we will have scienti@@ fic ans@@ wers to every con@@ c@@ ei@@ v@@ able mor@@ al question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for in@@ stan@@ ce , that you will one day con@@ sul@@ t a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should b@@ om@@ b I@@ ran &apos;s n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar fac@@ ili@@ ties , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the full cost of TED as a business ex@@ pen@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions af@@ fect human wel@@ l@@ -@@ being then they do have ans@@ wers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ mit@@ ting this — just ad@@ mit@@ ting that there are right and wrong ans@@ wers to the question of how humans fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h — will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our expe@@ c@@ ta@@ tions of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For in@@ stan@@ ce , there are 2@@ 1 sta@@ tes in our country where cor@@ po@@ ral p@@ un@@ is@@ h@@ ment in the clas@@ s@@ room is leg@@ al , where it is leg@@ al for a teach@@ er to be@@ at a child with a wo@@ o@@ den bo@@ ard , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing large b@@ ru@@ is@@ es and b@@ lis@@ ters and even bre@@ aking the sk@@ in ."
"And hundre@@ ds of thousands of children , in@@ ci@@ den@@ tally , are sub@@ je@@ cted to this every year ."
"The lo@@ c@@ ations of these en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed dis@@ tri@@ cts , I think , will fai@@ l to surpris@@ e you ."
We &apos;re not talking about Con@@ ne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut .
And the ra@@ tion@@ al@@ e for this behavior is ex@@ plic@@ it@@ ly reli@@ gi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ ato@@ r of the universe h@@ im@@ self has told us not to s@@ par@@ e the ro@@ d , le@@ st we s@@ poi@@ l the child — this is in Pro@@ ver@@ bs 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the obvi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally spe@@ aking , to sub@@ ject children to pa@@ in and violence and public hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation as a way of en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ing heal@@ th@@ y emo@@ tional develo@@ pment and good behavior ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the no@@ tion of wel@@ l@@ -@@ being is tru@@ ly un@@ defin@@ ed , and see@@ min@@ g@@ ly per@@ pe@@ tually open to be re@@ -@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed ."
"And so , how ther@@ e@@ fore can there be an ob@@ je@@ ctive no@@ tion of wel@@ l@@ -@@ being ?"
"Well , consi@@ der by anal@@ og@@ y , the con@@ cept of physical health ."
The con@@ cept of physical health is un@@ defin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from M@@ ich@@ a@@ el S@@ pe@@ c@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
Wh@@ en this sta@@ tu@@ e was car@@ ved the a@@ verage life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ dd@@ le with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to run a mar@@ ath@@ on at age 200 will be consi@@ der@@ ed a pro@@ found dis@@ ability .
Pe@@ ople will sen@@ d you don@@ ations when you &apos;re in that condi@@ tion .
"( Laughter ) N@@ oti@@ ce that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is open , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely open for re@@ vision , does not make it v@@ ac@@ u@@ ous ."
The dis@@ tin@@ ction between a heal@@ th@@ y person and a de@@ ad one is about as cle@@ ar and con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to no@@ tice is there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the mor@@ al lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e : There may be e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent ways to organ@@ ize a human society so as to ma@@ xi@@ miz@@ e human fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ hing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ min@@ e an ob@@ je@@ ctive mor@@ ality ?"
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tem@@ p@@ ted to argu@@ e to you that there must be one right food to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a ran@@ ge of materi@@ als that con@@ stitu@@ te heal@@ th@@ y food .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less a cle@@ ar dis@@ tin@@ ction between food and po@@ is@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ wers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tem@@ pt us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human nu@@ tri@@ tion ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a uni@@ vers@@ al mor@@ ality would re@@ qui@@ re mor@@ al pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ m@@ it of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for in@@ stan@@ ce , if it &apos;s really wrong to li@@ e , it must always be wrong to li@@ e , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as mor@@ al tru@@ th ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , by anal@@ og@@ y , the game of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to play good ch@@ ess , a prin@@ ci@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t lo@@ se your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mo@@ ments when lo@@ sing your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en is a bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant thing to do .
There are mo@@ ments when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a doma@@ in of per@@ fect ob@@ je@@ c@@ tivity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this b@@ rin@@ gs us to the sor@@ ts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the mor@@ al sp@@ here ."
Con@@ si@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ dies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can co@@ ver them up .
"Now , it is the posi@@ tion , gener@@ ally spe@@ aking , of our intel@@ le@@ c@@ tual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ os@@ ton or P@@ alo Al@@ to , who are we to say that the pro@@ u@@ d den@@ iz@@ ens of an an@@ ci@@ ent culture are wrong to for@@ ce their wi@@ ves and d@@ augh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with l@@ eng@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or thro@@ w bat@@ ter@@ y ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they dec@@ line the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pre@@ ten@@ d that we know so little about human wel@@ l@@ -@@ being that we have to be non@@ -@@ ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental about a prac@@ tice like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about vol@@ un@@ tar@@ y w@@ ear@@ ing of a v@@ ei@@ l — women should be able to we@@ ar whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does vol@@ un@@ tar@@ y mean in a community where , when a girl gets rap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first im@@ pu@@ l@@ se , rather often , is to mu@@ r@@ der her out of s@@ ha@@ me ?"
"@@ Just let that fact de@@ ton@@ ate in your brain for a minu@@ te : Y@@ our d@@ aughter gets rap@@ ed , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ presen@@ ts a pe@@ ak of human fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ hing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the per@@ fect solution in our own society ."
"For in@@ stan@@ ce , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ stand almost any@@ where in the civi@@ liz@@ ed world ."
"Now , gran@@ ted , for many men it may re@@ qui@@ re a de@@ gre@@ e in ph@@ i@@ loso@@ ph@@ y to see something wrong with these images ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ fle@@ ctive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the per@@ fect ex@@ pres@@ sion of psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ical bal@@ ance with re@@ spe@@ ct to vari@@ ab@@ les like y@@ outh and beau@@ ty and women &apos;s bo@@ dies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ ti@@ mal environment in which to ra@@ ise our children ?"
"Pro@@ b@@ ably not . O@@ K , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spe@@ c@@ tr@@ um between these two extre@@ mes that re@@ presen@@ ts a place of better bal@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) Per@@ haps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the mor@@ al lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e ."
But the thing to no@@ tice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ ak .
"Now the i@@ ron@@ y , from my per@@ spe@@ ctive , is that the only people who see@@ m to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ wers to mor@@ al questions are reli@@ gi@@ ous de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ wers to mor@@ al questions because they got these ans@@ wers from a voice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ win@@ d , not because they made an intel@@ lig@@ ent analy@@ sis of the cau@@ ses and condi@@ tion of human and anima@@ l wel@@ l@@ -@@ being ."
"In fact , the en@@ du@@ ran@@ ce of reli@@ gion as a len@@ s through which most people view mor@@ al questions has se@@ para@@ ted most mor@@ al talk from real questions of human and anima@@ l su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing ."
This is why we spend our time talking about things like g@@ ay mar@@ ri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or po@@ ver@@ ty or any other hu@@ ge@@ ly con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al issu@@ e .
But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : We need a uni@@ vers@@ al con@@ cep@@ tion of human val@@ ues .
"Now , what stan@@ ds in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to no@@ tice is that we do something different when talking about mor@@ ality — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally se@@ cu@@ lar , ac@@ ade@@ mic , scienti@@ st ty@@ pes ."
Wh@@ en talking about mor@@ ality we val@@ ue differ@@ ences of op@@ in@@ ion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
"So , for in@@ stan@@ ce the D@@ al@@ ai La@@ ma gets up every mor@@ ning me@@ d@@ it@@ ating on com@@ passion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ ping other human be@@ ings is an in@@ te@@ gra@@ l com@@ pon@@ ent of human hap@@ pin@@ ess ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy ; T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy was very fon@@ d of ab@@ duc@@ ting and rap@@ ing and tor@@ tur@@ ing and kil@@ ling young women ."
"So , we appe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ in@@ ion about how to pro@@ f@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ os@@ t W@@ ester@@ n intel@@ le@@ c@@ tu@@ als look at this sit@@ u@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ al@@ ai La@@ ma to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real argu@@ ment that poten@@ ti@@ ally f@@ alls within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He lik@@ es cho@@ col@@ ate , he lik@@ es van@@ il@@ la ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the other . &quot; &quot; N@@ oti@@ ce that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .

"If you ask the smar@@ test physi@@ c@@ is@@ ts around who is the smar@@ test physi@@ c@@ ist around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I sho@@ wed up at a physi@@ cs con@@ fer@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing theor@@ y is bo@@ g@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t res@@ on@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small scale .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physi@@ c@@ ist ; I don &apos;t understand str@@ ing theor@@ y ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy of str@@ ing theor@@ y .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to be@@ long to any str@@ ing theor@@ y clu@@ b that would have me as a mem@@ ber .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ in@@ i@@ ons must be ex@@ clu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a doma@@ in of ex@@ per@@ tise .
That is what it is for knowledge to coun@@ t .
"@@ How have we con@@ vin@@ ced ourselves that in the mor@@ al sp@@ here there is no such thing as mor@@ al ex@@ per@@ tise , or mor@@ al tal@@ ent , or mor@@ al gen@@ i@@ us even ? How have we con@@ vin@@ ced our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ in@@ ion has to coun@@ t ? How have we con@@ vin@@ ced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ jects wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ?
D@@ o@@ es the T@@ ali@@ ban have a point of view on physi@@ cs that is wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ig@@ nor@@ ance any less obvi@@ ous on the sub@@ ject of human wel@@ l@@ -@@ being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now ."
"It needs people like ourselves to ad@@ m@@ it that there are right and wrong ans@@ wers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ hing , and mor@@ ality rela@@ tes to that doma@@ in of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for individu@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beli@@ ef@@ s and de@@ si@@ res that reli@@ ably le@@ ad to ne@@ ed@@ less human su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing ."
Just ad@@ mit@@ ting this will trans@@ form our dis@@ course about mor@@ ality .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies between na@@ tions mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world fil@@ led with de@@ struc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ inven@@ ted ; it will always be eas@@ i@@ er to bre@@ ak things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It see@@ ms to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , pa@@ ten@@ tly obvi@@ ous that we can no more re@@ spe@@ ct and to@@ l@@ er@@ ate vas@@ t differ@@ ences in no@@ tions of human wel@@ l@@ -@@ being than we can re@@ spe@@ ct or to@@ l@@ er@@ ate vas@@ t differ@@ ences in the no@@ tions about how disease spre@@ ad@@ s , or in the sa@@ fe@@ ty stan@@ dar@@ ds of buil@@ din@@ gs and air@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must con@@ ver@@ ge on the ans@@ wers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ m@@ it that these questions have ans@@ wers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ bus@@ ti@@ ble materi@@ al there ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther in this au@@ dience or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , hear@@ ing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ rag@@ e thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age see@@ ms to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the v@@ ei@@ l , you &apos;re talking about women dre@@ s@@ sed in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , spo@@ k@@ en with a lot of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a c@@ ele@@ bra@@ tion of fe@@ mal@@ e speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a resul@@ t of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is argu@@ ably a so@@ ph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ical view — &quot; that mal@@ e l@@ ust is not to be tr@@ us@@ ted . &quot;"
"I mean , can you eng@@ age in a con@@ vers@@ ation with that kind of woman without se@@ em@@ ing kind of cul@@ tural im@@ peri@@ alis@@ t ?"
"S@@ am H@@ ar@@ ris : Yeah , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a sen@@ t@@ ence , wat@@ ching the clo@@ ck tic@@ king , but the question is : What is vol@@ un@@ tar@@ y in a con@@ text where men have certain expe@@ c@@ ta@@ tions , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t v@@ ei@@ l yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to we@@ ar a v@@ ei@@ l , or a very fun@@ n@@ y h@@ at , or ta@@ t@@ too their face — I think we should be free to vol@@ un@@ tar@@ i@@ ly do whatever we want , but we have to be hon@@ est about the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that these women are plac@@ ed under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ag@@ er to always take their word for it , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re w@@ ear@@ ing a full bur@@ q@@ a ."
C@@ A : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of mor@@ al pro@@ gre@@ ss .
But can you re@@ con@@ c@@ ile that ?
"I think I under@@ sto@@ od you to say that you could re@@ con@@ c@@ ile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one di@@ men@@ sion@@ al , where we all have to think the same ."
"P@@ ain@@ t your picture of what ro@@ l@@ ling the clo@@ ck 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , bal@@ an@@ cing mor@@ al pro@@ gre@@ ss with ri@@ ch@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ m@@ it that we are on the pa@@ th to@@ ward under@@ standing our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important de@@ tai@@ l , then you have to ad@@ m@@ it that we are going to understand all of the posi@@ tive and ne@@ ga@@ tive qu@@ ali@@ ties of ourselves in much gre@@ ater de@@ tai@@ l ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand posi@@ tive social emo@@ tion like em@@ path@@ y and com@@ passion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that en@@ cou@@ rag@@ e it — whether they &apos;re gene@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and in@@ so@@ far as we beg@@ in to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably going to con@@ ver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gra@@ bs ."
It &apos;s not going to be like v@@ ei@@ ling my d@@ aughter from bir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ fi@@ dent and wel@@ l@@ -@@ educ@@ ated in the con@@ text of men who do de@@ si@@ re women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F g@@ r@@ ant to know that compu@@ l@@ sor@@ y v@@ ei@@ ling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone invol@@ ved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
D@@ o people love their d@@ augh@@ ters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ wers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the resul@@ ts come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ par@@ ed to shi@@ ft your in@@ s@@ tin@@ ctive cur@@ r@@ ent ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these issu@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well ye@@ ah , mo@@ du@@ lo one obvi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the con@@ text of a tru@@ ly de@@ lu@@ sion@@ al beli@@ ef system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my g@@ ay son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a b@@ oy@@ friend , I cho@@ pped his head off . And that was the most com@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts al@@ ig@@ ned , y@@ es I think you could probably be feel@@ ing the emo@@ tion of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about wel@@ l@@ -@@ being in a lar@@ ger con@@ text ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feel@@ ing e@@ c@@ st@@ as@@ y and then blo@@ wing h@@ im@@ self up on a b@@ us ."

"B@@ ack in about 2@@ 000 , I was living in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , I was trying to fin@@ ish my first book , I was wan@@ der@@ ing around d@@ az@@ ed every day because I w@@ ro@@ te from 12 a@@ .@@ m@@ . to 5 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
So I would walk around in a d@@ az@@ e during the day .
"I had no mental ac@@ u@@ ity to speak of during the day , but I had f@@ lex@@ i@@ ble hours ."
"In the B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od that I li@@ ved in , Par@@ k S@@ lo@@ pe , there are a lot of w@@ rit@@ ers — it &apos;s like a very high per cap@@ ita ra@@ tio of w@@ rit@@ ers to nor@@ mal people ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , I had gro@@ wn up around a lot of teach@@ ers ."
"My mo@@ m was a teach@@ er , my sis@@ ter became a teach@@ er and after colle@@ ge so many of my friends went into teach@@ ing ."
"And so I was always hear@@ ing them talk about their lives and how inspi@@ ring they were , and they were really sort of the most har@@ d-@@ working and con@@ stan@@ tly inspi@@ ring people I knew ."
"But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the str@@ ug@@ g@@ les they were de@@ al@@ ing with ."
"And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teach@@ ing in city scho@@ ols were having tro@@ u@@ ble with their students ke@@ ep@@ ing up at gra@@ de level , in their read@@ ing and wri@@ ting in particular ."
"Now , so many of these students had come from h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ ds where Eng@@ lish isn &apos;t spo@@ k@@ en in the home , where a lot of them have different speci@@ al needs , learning dis@@ ab@@ ili@@ ties . And of course they &apos;re working in scho@@ ols which sometimes and very often are under@@ -@@ fun@@ ded ."
"And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bo@@ dies , more on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion , more hours , more ex@@ per@@ tise from people that have sk@@ il@@ ls in Eng@@ lish and can work with these students on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five clas@@ ses of 30 to 40 students each ."
"This can le@@ ad up to 1@@ 50 , 1@@ 80 , 200 students a day ."
How can we possi@@ bly give each stu@@ dent even one h@@ our a week of on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to gre@@ at@@ ly mul@@ ti@@ ply the wor@@ k@@ week and cl@@ one the teach@@ ers .
And so we started talking about this .
"And at the same time , I thought about this mas@@ sive group of people I knew : w@@ rit@@ ers , e@@ di@@ tors , jour@@ n@@ alis@@ ts , gra@@ du@@ ate students , as@@ sis@@ tant pro@@ fes@@ sor@@ s , you name it ."
"A@@ ll these people that had sort of f@@ lex@@ i@@ ble dai@@ ly hours and an inter@@ est in the Eng@@ lish word — I hope to have an inter@@ est in the Eng@@ lish language , but I &apos;m not spe@@ aking it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clo@@ ck has got me ."
"But everyone that I knew had an inter@@ est in the pri@@ ma@@ cy of the w@@ rit@@ ten word in terms of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing a democra@@ cy , n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing an en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed life ."
"And so they had , you know , their time and their inter@@ est , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a con@@ du@@ it that I knew of in my community to bring these two comm@@ uni@@ ties together ."
"So when I mo@@ ved back to S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , we ren@@ ted this building ."
"And the idea was to put M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s — M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s Q@@ u@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly , that we pub@@ lis@@ hed tw@@ ice or three times a year , and a few other mag@@ az@@ ines — we were going to move it into an off@@ ice for the first time ."
It used to be in my k@@ it@@ ch@@ en in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n .
"We were going to move it into an off@@ ice , and we were going to actually share space with a tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter ."
"So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these w@@ rit@@ ers and e@@ di@@ tors and everybody — sort of a wri@@ ting community — coming into the off@@ ice every day any@@ way , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get ex@@ tra help on their w@@ rit@@ ten ho@@ me@@ work , so you have basically no bor@@ der between these two comm@@ uni@@ ties ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . the students f@@ low in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you tra@@ de , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is ."
You give those hours in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on to the students in the n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od .
"So , we had this place , we ren@@ ted it , the lan@@ d@@ l@@ or@@ d was all for it . We did this mu@@ ral , that &apos;s a Ch@@ ris W@@ are mu@@ ral , that basically expl@@ ain@@ s the entire history of the prin@@ ted word , in mu@@ ral form — it takes a long time to di@@ gest and you have to stand in the middle of the ro@@ ad ."
So we ren@@ ted this space .
"And everything was great ex@@ cept the lan@@ d@@ l@@ or@@ d said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is zon@@ ed for re@@ tai@@ l ; you have to come up with something ."
You &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ta se@@ ll something .
"You can &apos;t just have a tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; H@@ a h@@ a ! Re@@ ally ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly to se@@ ll , but we did all the ne@@ cess@@ ary research ."
"It used to be a w@@ eight room , so there were ru@@ b@@ ber flo@@ ors be@@ low , ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ c ti@@ le c@@ ei@@ lin@@ gs and flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent li@@ ghts ."
"We took all that down , and we found beautiful wo@@ o@@ den flo@@ ors , wh@@ ite@@ was@@ hed be@@ am@@ s and it had the look — while we were ren@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hu@@ ll of a ship . &quot;"
"And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should se@@ ll sup@@ pli@@ es to the working b@@ uc@@ can@@ e@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody lau@@ gh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that ."
Let &apos;s se@@ ll pi@@ rate sup@@ pli@@ es . &quot; &quot; This is the pi@@ rate sup@@ ply sto@@ re .
"You see , this is sort of a s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch I did on a n@@ ap@@ k@@ in ."
"A great car@@ pen@@ ter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pi@@ rate sup@@ pl@@ y@@ -@@ like ."
Here you see plan@@ ks sol@@ d by the fo@@ ot and we have sup@@ pli@@ es to com@@ b@@ at s@@ cur@@ v@@ y .
"We have the pe@@ g le@@ gs there , that are all h@@ and@@ made and f@@ it@@ ted to you ."
"U@@ p at the top , you see the ey@@ ep@@ at@@ ch dis@@ play , which is the black col@@ um@@ n there for every@@ day use for your ey@@ ep@@ at@@ ch , and then you have the pas@@ te@@ l and other col@@ ors for ste@@ p@@ ping out at night — speci@@ al oc@@ cas@@ i@@ ons , b@@ ar mit@@ z@@ va@@ h@@ s and whatever ."
So we open@@ ed this place . And this is a v@@ at that we f@@ ill with tre@@ asu@@ res that students di@@ g in .
This is re@@ plac@@ e@@ ment eyes in case you lo@@ se one .
These are some sig@@ ns that we have all over the place : &quot; P@@ ra@@ c@@ tical Jo@@ king with P@@ i@@ ra@@ tes . &quot;
"Wh@@ ile you &apos;re read@@ ing the sig@@ n , we pu@@ ll a ro@@ pe behind the coun@@ ter and eight mo@@ p head@@ s dro@@ p on your head ."
That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that dro@@ ps on people &apos;s head@@ s .
"It became mo@@ p head@@ s . And this is the fish the@@ ater , which is just a sal@@ tw@@ ater tan@@ k with three se@@ a@@ ts , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter ."
"So right there is the tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter , and then behind the cur@@ tain were the M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s of@@ fic@@ es , where all of us would be working on the mag@@ az@@ ine and book e@@ di@@ ting and things like that ."
The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
"We set the place up , we open@@ ed up , we spent months and months ren@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place ."
"We had tab@@ les , ch@@ air@@ s , compu@@ ters , everything ."
I went to a d@@ ot@@ -@@ co@@ m au@@ ction at a H@@ o@@ li@@ day In@@ n in P@@ alo Al@@ to and I b@@ ou@@ ght 11 G@@ 4@@ s with a stro@@ ke of a pa@@ dd@@ le .
"A@@ ny@@ way , we b@@ ou@@ ght &apos; e@@ m , we set everything up and then we w@@ ai@@ ted ."
"It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were w@@ rit@@ ers in the n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
"And we s@@ at . And at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . we put a s@@ and@@ w@@ ich bo@@ ard out on the front si@@ de@@ walk and it just said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree T@@ u@@ tor@@ ing for Y@@ our Eng@@ lis@@ h@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated and W@@ ri@@ tin@@ g@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated Ne@@ e@@ ds — Just C@@ ome In , It &apos;s All F@@ ree . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to s@@ tor@@ m the ga@@ tes , they &apos;re gon@@ na love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t ."
"And so we w@@ ai@@ ted , we s@@ at at the tab@@ les , we w@@ ai@@ ted and w@@ ai@@ ted ."
"And everybody was be@@ coming very dis@@ cou@@ rag@@ ed because it was we@@ eks and we@@ eks that we w@@ ai@@ ted , really , where no@@ body came in ."
"And then somebody al@@ er@@ ted us to the fact that maybe there was a tr@@ ust g@@ ap , because we were oper@@ ating behind a pi@@ rate sup@@ ply sto@@ re . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?"
"And so then , around that time , I per@@ su@@ a@@ ded a woman na@@ med N@@ in@@ ev@@ e@@ h C@@ al@@ ig@@ ari , a lon@@ g@@ time S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o educ@@ ato@@ r — she was teach@@ ing in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity , she had all the experience ne@@ cess@@ ary , knew everything about education , was conne@@ cted with all the teach@@ ers and community mem@@ bers in the n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od — I con@@ vin@@ ced her to move up from M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity where she was teach@@ ing ."
She took over as exe@@ cu@@ tive direc@@ tor .
"I@@ m@@ me@@ dia@@ tely , she made the in@@ ro@@ ad@@ s with the teach@@ ers and the parents and the students and everything , and so su@@ d@@ den@@ ly it was actually full every day ."
And what we were trying to of@@ fer every day was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion .
The go@@ al was to have a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one ra@@ tio with every one of these students .
"You know , it &apos;s been pro@@ ven that 3@@ 5 to 40 hours a year with on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion , a stu@@ dent can get one gra@@ de level high@@ er ."
"And so most of these students , Eng@@ lish is not spo@@ k@@ en in the home ."
"They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a ch@@ ur@@ ch pe@@ w that I b@@ ou@@ ght in a B@@ er@@ ke@@ le@@ y au@@ ction right there — the parents will sometimes wat@@ ch while their kids are being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"So that was the bas@@ is of it , was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion ."
And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
"If you &apos;re on V@@ al@@ en@@ c@@ ia S@@ tre@@ et within those few blo@@ cks at around 2 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big bac@@ k@@ p@@ ac@@ ks , or whatever , actually run@@ ning to this space , which is very str@@ an@@ ge , because it &apos;s school , in a way ."
But there was something psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ical happening there that was just a little bit different .
"And the other thing was , there was no stig@@ ma ."
"K@@ i@@ ds wer@@ en &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; C@@ en@@ ter@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ K@@ id@@ s@@ -@@ Th@@ at@@ -@@ Ne@@ ed@@ -@@ M@@ or@@ e-@@ H@@ el@@ p , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ c@@ ia ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it was a pi@@ rate sup@@ ply sto@@ re , which is in@@ s@@ ane ."
"And then secon@@ dly , there &apos;s a pub@@ lis@@ hing company in the back ."
"And so our inter@@ ns were actually working at the same tab@@ les very often , and sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , compu@@ ter@@ -@@ ne@@ x@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ computer with the students ."
"And so it became a tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter — pub@@ lis@@ hing cen@@ ter , is what we called it — and a wri@@ ting cen@@ ter ."
"They go in , and they might be working with a high school stu@@ dent actually working on a no@@ vel — because we had very gi@@ f@@ ted kids , too ."
So there &apos;s no stig@@ ma .
They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a crea@@ tive en@@ de@@ av@@ or .
They &apos;re seeing ad@@ ul@@ ts . They &apos;re mode@@ ling their behavior .
"Th@@ ese ad@@ ul@@ ts , they &apos;re working in their field ."
"They can le@@ an over , ask a question of one of these ad@@ ul@@ ts and it all sort of fe@@ e@@ ds on each other ."
"There &apos;s a lot of cro@@ ss@@ -@@ pol@@ lin@@ ation . The only problem , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally for the ad@@ ul@@ ts working at M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s who ha@@ dn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly b@@ ou@@ ght into all of this when they sig@@ ned up , was that there was just the one ba@@ thro@@ om . ( Laughter ) W@@ ith like 60 kids a day , this is a problem ."
"But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids fin@@ is@@ hing their ho@@ me@@ work in a given day , working on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one , getting all this atten@@ tion — they go home , they &apos;re fin@@ is@@ hed . They don &apos;t st@@ all ."
They don &apos;t do their ho@@ me@@ work in front of the T@@ V .
"They &apos;re allo@@ wed to go home at 5 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , en@@ j@@ oy their family , en@@ j@@ oy other ho@@ b@@ b@@ ies , get outside , play ."
And that makes a happy family .
A b@@ un@@ ch of happy fami@@ lies in a n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od is a happy community .
A b@@ un@@ ch of happy comm@@ uni@@ ties ti@@ ed together is a happy city and a happy world .
"So the key to it all is ho@@ me@@ work ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion ."
"So we started off with about 12 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundre@@ d ."
"And we now have 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers on our ros@@ ter ."
And we make it incredi@@ bly easy to vol@@ un@@ te@@ er .
"The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a mon@@ th , those two hours sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , next to one stu@@ dent , con@@ cen@@ tra@@ ted atten@@ tion , sh@@ in@@ ing this be@@ am of light on their work , on their thou@@ ghts and their self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , is going to be absolu@@ tely trans@@ for@@ mati@@ ve , because so many of the students have not had that ever before ."
"So we said , &quot; &quot; E@@ ven if you have two hours one S@@ un@@ day every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s par@@ tly why the tu@@ tor cor@@ ps gre@@ w so f@@ ast ."
"Th@@ en we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . ? &quot; &quot; So we started b@@ rin@@ ging in clas@@ ses during the day ."
"So every day , there &apos;s a field tri@@ p where they together create a book — you can see it being ty@@ ped up ab@@ o@@ ve ."
This is one of the clas@@ ses getting way too exci@@ ted about wri@@ ting .
"You just point a ca@@ mera at a clas@@ s , and it always looks like this ."
So this is one of the books that they do .
"N@@ oti@@ ce the ti@@ tle of the book , &quot; The Bo@@ ok That W@@ as N@@ ever Ch@@ e@@ c@@ ked O@@ ut : T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot;"
"And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce there was a book na@@ med C@@ in@@ dy that was about the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot; &quot; So , me@@ an@@ while , there &apos;s an ad@@ ult in the back ty@@ ping this up , taking it completely ser@@ i@@ ously , which blo@@ ws their mind ."
So then we still had more tu@@ tors to use .
This is a sho@@ t of just some of the tu@@ tors during one of the ev@@ ents .
The teach@@ ers that we work with — and everything is different to teach@@ ers — they tell us what to do .
"We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely , completely mal@@ le@@ able . You &apos;re going to tell us ."
"The n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us ."
"The teach@@ ers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most u@@ se@@ ful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the scho@@ ols ?"
"Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly , who don &apos;t have really ac@@ tive parents that are b@@ rin@@ ging them in , or ar@@ en &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 people on our tu@@ tor ros@@ ter ."
"L@@ et &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teach@@ er will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tu@@ tors for the next five S@@ un@@ days ."
"We &apos;re working on our colle@@ ge es@@ says . S@@ end them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wi@@ re : 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 tu@@ tors ."
W@@ ho@@ ever can make it sig@@ ns up . They go in about a half an h@@ our before the clas@@ s .
"The teach@@ er tel@@ ls them what to do , how to do it , what their tra@@ in@@ ing is , what their project is so far ."
"They work under the teach@@ er &apos;s gu@@ i@@ de , and it &apos;s all in one big room ."
"And that &apos;s actually the b@@ run@@ t of what we do is , people going stra@@ i@@ ght from their wor@@ k@@ place , stra@@ i@@ ght from home , stra@@ i@@ ght into the clas@@ s@@ room and working direc@@ tly with the students ."
So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
"Th@@ en another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a clas@@ s@@ room and you can sta@@ ff it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the E@@ ver@@ e@@ t@@ t M@@ id@@ d@@ le S@@ cho@@ ol W@@ rit@@ ers &apos; R@@ o@@ om , where we de@@ cor@@ ated it in b@@ uc@@ can@@ e@@ er st@@ y@@ le ."
It &apos;s right off the li@@ br@@ ary . And there we ser@@ ve all 5@@ 2@@ 9 kids in this middle school .
"This is their ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er , the &quot; &quot; S@@ tra@@ i@@ gh@@ t-@@ U@@ p Ne@@ ws , &quot; &quot; that has an on@@ going col@@ um@@ n from M@@ ay@@ or G@@ av@@ in Ne@@ w@@ so@@ m in both langu@@ ages — Eng@@ lish and S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"So then one day I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ len@@ de w@@ ro@@ te to us and said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why don &apos;t you as@@ sig@@ n a book with high school students ?"
"I want them to write about how to ach@@ i@@ eve pe@@ ace in a viol@@ ent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Th@@ ur@@ good Mar@@ sh@@ all H@@ igh S@@ cho@@ ol , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment to the students ."
"And we said , &quot; &quot; I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ len@@ de is going to read all your es@@ says at the end ."
She &apos;s going to pub@@ lish them in a book .
She &apos;s going to s@@ pon@@ s@@ or the prin@@ ting of this book in pap@@ er@@ back form .
"It &apos;s going to be av@@ ail@@ able in all the bo@@ ok@@ s@@ tor@@ es in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a and thro@@ ugh@@ out the world , on A@@ maz@@ on and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside au@@ dience , there was I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ len@@ de on the other end ."
I think we had about 1@@ 70 tu@@ tors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredi@@ bly well .
We had a big par@@ ty at the end .
This is a book that you can find any@@ where . So that led to a ser@@ ies of these .
"You can see A@@ my T@@ an s@@ pon@@ sor@@ ed the next one , &quot; I M@@ i@@ ght G@@ et S@@ ome@@ where . &quot;"
And this became an on@@ going thing . M@@ ore and more books .
Now we &apos;re sort of ad@@ di@@ cted to the book thing .
"The kids will work har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be per@@ man@@ ent , know it &apos;s going to be on a sh@@ el@@ f , know that no@@ body can di@@ min@@ ish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve hon@@ or@@ ed their words , hon@@ or@@ ed their thou@@ ghts with hundre@@ ds of hours of five dra@@ f@@ ts , six dra@@ f@@ ts — all this atten@@ tion that we give to their thou@@ ghts ."
"And once they ach@@ i@@ eve that level , once they &apos;ve w@@ rit@@ ten at that level , they can never go back ."
It &apos;s absolu@@ tely trans@@ for@@ mati@@ ve .
And so then they &apos;re all sol@@ d in the sto@@ re . This is ne@@ ar the plan@@ ks .
We se@@ ll all the stu@@ dent books .
"Wh@@ ere else would you put them , right ?"
"So we se@@ ll &apos; e@@ m , and then something w@@ ei@@ r@@ d had been happening with the s@@ tor@@ es . The sto@@ re , actually — even though we started out as just a ga@@ g — the sto@@ re actually made money ."
So it was pa@@ ying the r@@ ent .
"And maybe this is just a S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to ju@@ dge ."
But people would come in — and this was before the pi@@ rate movi@@ es and everything !
"It was making a lot of money . N@@ ot a lot of money , but it was pa@@ ying the r@@ ent , pa@@ ying a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time sta@@ ff mem@@ ber there ."
There &apos;s the oc@@ ean ma@@ ps you can see on the left .
And it became a ga@@ te@@ way to the community .
"P@@ e@@ ople would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?"
What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to s@@ we@@ ar on the we@@ b . ( Laughter ) I@@ s that a ru@@ le ? I don &apos;t know .
"They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it ."
"And then right be@@ y@@ ond — there &apos;s usu@@ ally a little ch@@ ain there — right be@@ y@@ ond , they would see the kids being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"This is a field tri@@ p going on . And so they would be sho@@ p@@ ping , and they might be more lik@@ ely to bu@@ y some lar@@ d , or mil@@ let for their par@@ ro@@ t , or , you know , a ho@@ ok , or ho@@ ok prote@@ c@@ tor for ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time , all of these things we se@@ ll ."
So the sto@@ re actually did really well .
"But it bro@@ ught in so many people — teach@@ ers , don@@ ors , vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , everybody — because it was stre@@ et level . It was open to the public ."
"It wasn &apos;t a non@@ -@@ pro@@ f@@ it bu@@ ried , you know , on the 3@@ 0@@ th flo@@ or of some building do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn . It was right in the n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od that it was ser@@ ving , and it was open all the time to the public ."
"So , it became this sort of w@@ ei@@ r@@ d , happy ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So all the people I used to know in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;"
"And a lot of them had been for@@ mer educ@@ a@@ tors or w@@ ou@@ l@@ d-@@ be educ@@ a@@ tors , so they com@@ b@@ ined with a lot of local desig@@ ners , local w@@ rit@@ ers , and they just took the idea in@@ depen@@ den@@ tly and they did their own thing ."
They didn &apos;t want to se@@ ll pi@@ rate sup@@ pli@@ es .
They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
"So , kno@@ wing the cri@@ me@@ -@@ fi@@ gh@@ ting community in New York , they open@@ ed the B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n S@@ uper@@ her@@ o S@@ up@@ ply C@@ om@@ pan@@ y ."
This is S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts &apos; great design that did this .
"And this was to make it look sort of like one of those ke@@ y@@ sm@@ ith &apos;s sho@@ ps that has to have every serv@@ ice they &apos;ve ever of@@ fer@@ ed , you know , all over there ."
"So they open@@ ed this place . In@@ side , it &apos;s like a C@@ os@@ t@@ c@@ o for super@@ her@@ o@@ es — all the sup@@ pli@@ es in kind of bas@@ ic form ."
These are all h@@ and@@ made .
"Th@@ ese are all sort of re@@ pur@@ posed other produc@@ ts , or whatever ."
All the p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ging is done by S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts .
"So then you have the v@@ il@@ la@@ in con@@ tain@@ ment un@@ it , where kids put their parents . You have the off@@ ice ."
"This is a little v@@ au@@ l@@ t — you have to put your produc@@ t in there , it goes up an electri@@ c li@@ ft and then the guy behind the coun@@ ter tel@@ ls you that you have to rec@@ ite the v@@ ow of her@@ o@@ ism , which you do , if you want to bu@@ y anything . And it lim@@ its , really , their sal@@ es ."
"P@@ er@@ son@@ ally , I think it &apos;s a problem ."
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
These are some of the produc@@ ts . These are all h@@ and@@ made .
This is a se@@ cre@@ t identi@@ ty k@@ it .
"If you want to take on the identi@@ ty of S@@ ha@@ ron Bo@@ one , one American fe@@ mal@@ e marke@@ ting exe@@ cu@@ tive from H@@ o@@ bo@@ k@@ en , New J@@ er@@ se@@ y . It &apos;s a full dos@@ si@@ er on everything you would need to know about S@@ ha@@ ron Bo@@ one ."
"So , this is the cap@@ er@@ y where you get f@@ it@@ ted for your cap@@ e , and then you walk up these three ste@@ el@@ -@@ gra@@ ded ste@@ ps and then we turn on three hy@@ d@@ r@@ au@@ lic fan@@ s from every side and then you can see the cap@@ e in action ."
"There &apos;s nothing wor@@ se than , you know , getting up there and the cap@@ e is b@@ un@@ ching up or something like that ."
"So then , the se@@ cre@@ t do@@ or — this is one of the sh@@ el@@ ves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly open@@ s ."
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grap@@ pl@@ ing ho@@ o@@ ks .
It open@@ s and then this is the tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full effe@@ ct !
"But this is — I just want to em@@ ph@@ as@@ ize — lo@@ cally fun@@ ded , lo@@ cally built ."
"A@@ ll the desig@@ ners , all of the buil@@ ders , everybody was local , all the time was pro@@ -@@ b@@ ono ."
"I just came and visi@@ ted and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five bo@@ ro@@ ugh@@ s of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tu@@ tor@@ ing hours ."
"It &apos;s very bus@@ y . S@@ ame prin@@ ci@@ ples : on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion , comple@@ te de@@ vo@@ tion to the students &apos; work and a b@@ oun@@ d@@ less op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m and sort of a possi@@ bility of crea@@ tivity and ideas ."
"And this s@@ wit@@ ch is fli@@ c@@ ked in their head@@ s when they walk through those 1@@ 8 fe@@ et of this b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re sto@@ re , right ?"
"So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school ."
"It &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly not school , even though they &apos;re working sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der on tab@@ les , pen@@ c@@ il@@ s and pap@@ ers , whatever ."
"This is one of the students , K@@ hal@@ ed H@@ am@@ d@@ an ."

A@@ d@@ di@@ cted to video g@@ ames and T@@ V . C@@ ouldn &apos;t con@@ cen@@ tra@@ te at home .
C@@ ame in . Go@@ t this con@@ cen@@ tra@@ ted atten@@ tion .
And he couldn &apos;t es@@ cap@@ e it .
"So , so@@ on enough , he was wri@@ ting . He would fin@@ ish his ho@@ me@@ work early — got really ad@@ di@@ cted to fin@@ is@@ hing his ho@@ me@@ work early ."
"It &apos;s an ad@@ dic@@ tive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it che@@ c@@ ked , and to know he &apos;s going to ach@@ i@@ eve the next thing and be pre@@ par@@ ed for school the next day ."
"So he got ho@@ o@@ ked on that , and then he started doing other things ."
He &apos;s now been pub@@ lis@@ hed in five books .

"And then he read al@@ ou@@ d just a few we@@ eks ago to 500 people at S@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y S@@ p@@ ace , at a ben@@ ef@@ it for 8@@ 2@@ 6 New York . So he &apos;s there every day ."
He &apos;s ev@@ an@@ ge@@ li@@ cal about it . He b@@ rin@@ gs his cou@@ s@@ ins in now .
There &apos;s four family mem@@ bers that come in every day .

So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven would be .
Le@@ ech@@ es . M@@ am@@ m@@ ot@@ h ch@@ un@@ ks . They even have their own S@@ lu@@ r@@ pe@@ e machine : &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of O@@ r@@ der . C@@ ome B@@ ack Y@@ ester@@ day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) An@@ y@@ way . So I &apos;m going to j@@ um@@ p a@@ head .

Now I &apos;m going to the TED W@@ ish — is that o@@ kay ?
"A@@ ll right , I &apos;ve got a minu@@ te . So , the TED W@@ ish : I w@@ ish that you — you person@@ ally and every crea@@ tive individu@@ al and organ@@ ization you know — will find a way to direc@@ tly eng@@ age with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got invol@@ ved , so that within a year we have a thous@@ and exam@@ ples — a thous@@ and ! — of trans@@ for@@ mati@@ ve par@@ t@@ ner@@ shi@@ ps ."
Pro@@ found le@@ ap@@ s forward !
And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
"I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and inspi@@ re others on the w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite ."
We created a w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite .
"I &apos;m going to s@@ wit@@ ch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the atten@@ de@@ es of this con@@ fer@@ ence will us@@ her in a new era of parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion in our public scho@@ ols ."
We hope that you will take the le@@ ad in par@@ t@@ ner@@ ing your inno@@ va@@ tive spi@@ ri@@ t and ex@@ per@@ tise with that of inno@@ va@@ tive educ@@ a@@ tors in your community .
Al@@ ways let the teach@@ ers le@@ ad the way .
They will tell you how to be u@@ se@@ ful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
There are a million ways .
You can walk up to your local school and con@@ sul@@ t with the teach@@ ers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
"So , this is with H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ dio in S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , they did this ph@@ en@@ omen@@ al job ."
"This w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite is already up , it &apos;s already got a b@@ un@@ ch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce U@@ po@@ n a S@@ cho@@ ol , &quot; &quot; which is a great ti@@ tle , I think ."
"This s@@ ite will do@@ cu@@ ment every story , every project that comes out of this con@@ fer@@ ence and around the world . So you go to the w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite , you see a b@@ un@@ ch of ideas you can be inspi@@ red by and then you ad@@ d your own pro@@ jects once you get started ."
"H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ dio did a great job in a very ti@@ ght de@@ ad@@ line . So , vis@@ it the s@@ ite ."
"If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our direc@@ tor of national progra@@ ms . He &apos;ll be on the phone ."
"You ema@@ il him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possi@@ bly want ."
And he &apos;ll get you inspi@@ red and get you going and gu@@ i@@ de you through the process so that you can af@@ fect change .
And it can be fu@@ n ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it nee@@ dn &apos;t be ster@@ ile . It nee@@ dn &apos;t be bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic@@ ally un@@ ten@@ able .
You can do and use the sk@@ il@@ ls that you have .
The scho@@ ols need you . The teach@@ ers need you .
"S@@ tu@@ dents and parents need you . They need your ac@@ tual person : your physical person@@ ho@@ od and your open min@@ ds and open ear@@ s and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less com@@ passion , sitting next to them , lis@@ ten@@ ing and no@@ d@@ ding and as@@ king questions for hours at a time ."
S@@ ome of these kids just don &apos;t pl@@ ain know how good they are : how smar@@ t and how much they have to say .
"You can tell them . You can sh@@ ine that light on them , one human inter@@ action at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll jo@@ in us ."
Thank you so much .
"So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a stre@@ et any@@ where in America and a J@@ apan@@ ese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Ex@@ cu@@ se me , what is the name of this blo@@ ck ? &quot;"
"And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , well , this is O@@ ak S@@ tre@@ et , that &apos;s E@@ l@@ m S@@ tre@@ et ."

"So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a stre@@ et , any@@ where in J@@ ap@@ an , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Ex@@ cu@@ se me , what is the name of this stre@@ et ? &quot;"
"They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 and this is B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 6 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but what is the name of this stre@@ et ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , stre@@ ets don &apos;t have n@@ ames ."
B@@ lo@@ cks have n@@ ames .
"@@ Just look at Google M@@ ap@@ s here . There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 4 , 15 , 1@@ 6 , 1@@ 7 , 1@@ 8 , 1@@ 9 ."
"A@@ ll of these blo@@ cks have n@@ ames , and the stre@@ ets are just the un@@ na@@ med sp@@ ac@@ es in between the blo@@ cks ."
"And you say then , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , then how do you know your home ad@@ dre@@ ss ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is D@@ is@@ tri@@ ct Ei@@ ght ."
"There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but wal@@ king around the n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od , I no@@ tic@@ ed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ f course they do . They go in the order in which they were built ."
The first house ever built on a blo@@ ck is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
"Th@@ ird is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvi@@ ous . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the op@@ pos@@ ite side of the world to realize as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the op@@ pos@@ ite of them may also be true ."
"So , for example , there are doc@@ tors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you heal@@ th@@ y ."
"So , any mon@@ th you are heal@@ th@@ y you p@@ ay them , and when you &apos;re si@@ ck you don &apos;t have to p@@ ay them because they fai@@ led at their job . They get ri@@ ch when you &apos;re heal@@ th@@ y , not si@@ ck ."
"( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the do@@ w@@ n@@ be@@ at , the beginning of the mu@@ si@@ cal ph@@ ras@@ e : one , two , three , four ."
"But in W@@ est Afri@@ can music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the ph@@ ras@@ e , like the peri@@ od at the end of a sen@@ t@@ ence ."
"So , you can hear it not just in the ph@@ ras@@ ing , but the way they coun@@ t off their music : two , three , four , one ."
And this ma@@ p is also ac@@ cu@@ rate .

D@@ om@@ o ar@@ ig@@ a@@ to go@@ z@@ ai@@ mas@@ hi@@ ta .
Wh@@ o b@@ om@@ bed your house ?
Wh@@ o kil@@ led your son ?
Di@@ d the rest of your family make it out ali@@ ve ?
How are you co@@ ping in your life in ex@@ ile ?
"But there &apos;s one question that always see@@ ms to me to be most re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing , and that is : What did you take ?"
"What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the b@@ om@@ bs were ex@@ plo@@ ding in your to@@ wn , and the ar@@ med gan@@ gs were appro@@ ach@@ ing your house ?"
A S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e bo@@ y I know told me that he didn &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate when his life was in im@@ min@@ ent dang@@ er .
"He took his high school diplo@@ ma , and later he told me why ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I took my high school diplo@@ ma because my life depen@@ ded on it . &quot; &quot; And he would ris@@ k his life to get that diplo@@ ma ."
"O@@ n his way to school , he would do@@ dge s@@ ni@@ per@@ s ."
"H@@ is clas@@ s@@ room sometimes sho@@ ok with the sound of b@@ om@@ bs and sh@@ el@@ ling , and his mother told me , &quot; &quot; E@@ very day , I would say to him every mor@@ ning , &apos; H@@ on@@ ey , ple@@ ase don &apos;t go to school . &apos; &quot; &quot; And when he in@@ sis@@ ted , she said , &quot; I would hu@@ g him as if it were for the last time . &quot;"
"But he said to his mother , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re all af@@ ra@@ id , but our de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation to gra@@ du@@ ate is st@@ ron@@ ger than our fe@@ ar . &quot; &quot; But one day , the family got terri@@ ble news ."
"H@@ any &apos;s au@@ nt , his un@@ cle and his cou@@ s@@ in were mu@@ r@@ der@@ ed in their h@@ om@@ es for re@@ fus@@ ing to leave their house ."
It was time to fle@@ e .
"They left that day , right away , in their car , H@@ any h@@ id@@ den in the back because they were fac@@ ing che@@ ck@@ poin@@ ts of men@@ ac@@ ing sol@@ di@@ ers ."
"And they would cro@@ ss the bor@@ der into L@@ eb@@ an@@ on , where they would find pe@@ ace ."
But they would beg@@ in a life of g@@ ru@@ el@@ ing har@@ d@@ ship and mon@@ o@@ ton@@ y .
"They had no choice but to build a sh@@ ack on the side of a mu@@ d@@ dy field , and this is H@@ any &apos;s bro@@ ther A@@ sh@@ ra@@ f , who pla@@ ys outside ."
"And that day , they jo@@ ined the big@@ gest population of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es in the world , in a country , L@@ eb@@ an@@ on , that is tin@@ y ."
"It only has four million ci@@ tiz@@ ens , and there are one million S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es living there ."
"There &apos;s not a to@@ wn , a city or a v@@ ill@@ age that is not hos@@ t to S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
"Th@@ in@@ k about it this way , pro@@ por@@ tion@@ a@@ tely ."
"It would be as if the entire population of Ger@@ many , 80 million people , would fle@@ e to the United States in just three years ."
"H@@ al@@ f of the entire population of S@@ y@@ ria is now u@@ pro@@ ot@@ ed , most of them inside the country ."
Si@@ x and a half million people have f@@ led for their lives .
"O@@ ver and well over three million people have cro@@ s@@ sed the bor@@ ders and have found s@@ an@@ c@@ tu@@ ary in the n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ing countries , and only a small pro@@ por@@ tion , as you see , have mo@@ ved on to Euro@@ pe ."
What I find most wor@@ r@@ ying is that half of all S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es are children .
I took this picture of this little girl .
It was just two hours after she had ar@@ riv@@ ed after a long tre@@ k from S@@ y@@ ria into J@@ or@@ d@@ an .
And most tro@@ u@@ b@@ ling of all is that only 20 percent of S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children are in school in L@@ eb@@ an@@ on .
"And yet , S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children , all re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives ."
Why ? Because it allo@@ ws them to think of their future rather than the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are of their past .
It allo@@ ws them to think of hope rather than ha@@ tre@@ d .
"I &apos;m re@@ min@@ ded of a re@@ cent vis@@ it I took to a S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p in nor@@ ther@@ n I@@ ra@@ q , and I met this girl , and I thought , &quot; &quot; She &apos;s beautiful , &quot; &quot; and I went up to her and asked her , &quot; C@@ an I take your picture ? &quot;"
"And she said y@@ es , but she re@@ fu@@ sed to s@@ mil@@ e ."
"And yet , look at what they f@@ led : u@@ tter de@@ struc@@ tion , buil@@ din@@ gs , indus@@ tries , scho@@ ols , ro@@ ad@@ s , h@@ om@@ es ."
H@@ any &apos;s home was also de@@ st@@ roy@@ ed .
"This will need to be re@@ built by archite@@ cts , by engine@@ ers , by electri@@ ci@@ ans ."
C@@ om@@ m@@ uni@@ ties will need teach@@ ers and la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans interested in re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation and not re@@ ven@@ ge .
"S@@ h@@ ouldn &apos;t this be re@@ built by the people with the lar@@ gest sta@@ ke , the socie@@ ties in ex@@ ile , the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ?"
Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es have a lot of time to pre@@ par@@ e for their re@@ turn .
You might imagine that being a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e is just a tem@@ por@@ ary state .
Well far from it .
"W@@ ith war@@ s going on and on , the a@@ verage time a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e will spend in ex@@ ile is 1@@ 7 years ."
We also spent some n@@ ice mo@@ ments of l@@ aughter and fu@@ n with his be@@ lo@@ ved bro@@ ther A@@ sh@@ ra@@ f .
But I &apos;ll never for@@ get what he told me when we en@@ ded our con@@ vers@@ ation that day .
"He said to me , &quot; If I am not a stu@@ dent , I am nothing . &quot;"
H@@ any is one of 50 million people u@@ pro@@ ot@@ ed in this world today .
N@@ ever since Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I have so many people been for@@ ci@@ bly dis@@ plac@@ ed .
"So while we &apos;re making s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing pro@@ gre@@ ss in human health , in technology , in education and design , we are doing dang@@ er@@ ously little to help the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms and we are doing far too little to stop and pre@@ v@@ ent the war@@ s that are dri@@ ving them from their h@@ om@@ es ."
And there are more and more v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms .
"E@@ very day , on a@@ verage , by the end of this day , 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people will be for@@ ci@@ bly dis@@ plac@@ ed from their h@@ om@@ es — 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people ."
They fle@@ e across bor@@ ders like this one .
"We cap@@ tu@@ red this on the S@@ y@@ ri@@ an bor@@ der to J@@ or@@ d@@ an , and this is a ty@@ pi@@ cal day ."
"O@@ r they fle@@ e on un@@ se@@ a@@ wor@@ th@@ y and over@@ cro@@ w@@ ded bo@@ a@@ ts , ris@@ king their lives in this case just to re@@ ach sa@@ fe@@ ty in Euro@@ pe ."
"This S@@ y@@ ri@@ an young man sur@@ vi@@ ved one of these bo@@ a@@ ts that cap@@ si@@ z@@ ed — most of the people dro@@ w@@ ned — and he told us , &quot; &quot; S@@ y@@ ri@@ ans are just looking for a qui@@ et place where no@@ body hu@@ r@@ ts you , where no@@ body hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ates you , and where no@@ body kil@@ ls you . &quot; &quot; Well , I think that should be the min@@ im@@ um ."
"@@ How about a place of heal@@ ing , of learning , and even opportunity ?"
"A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans and Euro@@ pe@@ ans have the im@@ pres@@ sion that pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ally huge numbers of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es are coming to their country , but the reality is that 8@@ 6 percent , the vas@@ t maj@@ or@@ ity of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , are living in the develo@@ ping world , in countries str@@ ug@@ g@@ ling with their own in@@ se@@ cur@@ ity , with their own issu@@ es of hel@@ ping their own popu@@ la@@ tions and po@@ ver@@ ty ."
So we@@ al@@ th@@ y countries in the world should reco@@ gn@@ ize the human@@ ity and the gener@@ os@@ ity of the countries that are hos@@ ting so many re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
And all countries should make sure that no one fle@@ e@@ ing war and per@@ se@@ cu@@ tion ar@@ ri@@ ves at a clo@@ sed bor@@ der .
( Applause ) Thank you .
But there is something more that we can do than just simply hel@@ ping re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es sur@@ vi@@ ve .
We can help them th@@ ri@@ ve .
We should think of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps and comm@@ uni@@ ties as more than just tem@@ por@@ ary population cen@@ ters where people langu@@ ish w@@ ai@@ ting for the war to end .
"@@ R@@ a@@ ther , as cen@@ ters of ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ence , where re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es can tri@@ um@@ p@@ h over their tr@@ au@@ ma and tra@@ in for the day that they can go home as ag@@ ents of posi@@ tive change and social trans@@ formation ."
"It makes so much sense , but I &apos;m re@@ min@@ ded of the terri@@ ble war in S@@ om@@ alia that has been rag@@ ing on for 2@@ 2 years ."
And imagine living in this cam@@ p .
I visi@@ ted this cam@@ p .
"It &apos;s in D@@ j@@ i@@ b@@ ou@@ ti , n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ing S@@ om@@ alia , and it was so re@@ m@@ ote that we had to take a he@@ li@@ co@@ p@@ ter to f@@ ly there ."
It was dus@@ ty and it was terri@@ bly ho@@ t .
"And we went to vis@@ it a school and started talking to the children , and then I saw this girl across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own d@@ aughter , and I went up and tal@@ ked to her ."
"And how I w@@ is@@ hed at that moment that I could say to her , &quot; We will build you a school . &quot;"
"And I also thought , what a was@@ te ."
"A bo@@ y na@@ med J@@ ac@@ o@@ b A@@ te@@ m had a different chan@@ ce , but not before he experi@@ en@@ ced terri@@ bly tra@@ ge@@ dy ."
"( Applause ) I spo@@ ke to him on S@@ ky@@ pe the other day , and he was in his new uni@@ versity in F@@ l@@ or@@ ida pur@@ su@@ ing his P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . in public health , and he pro@@ u@@ dly told me how he was able to ra@@ ise enough fun@@ ds from the American public to es@@ tab@@ lish a health c@@ lin@@ ic back in his v@@ ill@@ age back home ."
So I want to take you back to H@@ any .
"When I told him I was going to have the chan@@ ce to speak to you here on the TED sta@@ ge , he allo@@ wed me to read you a po@@ e@@ m that he s@@ ent in an ema@@ il to me ."
"He w@@ ro@@ te : &quot; &quot; I mis@@ s myself , my friends , times of read@@ ing no@@ vel@@ s or wri@@ ting po@@ e@@ ms , bir@@ ds and te@@ a in the mor@@ ning ."
"My room , my books , myself , and everything that was making me s@@ mil@@ e ."
"O@@ h , o@@ h , I had so many dre@@ am@@ s that were about to be realized . &quot; &quot; So here is my point : N@@ ot inv@@ es@@ ting in re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es is a huge mis@@ sed opportunity ."
"L@@ e@@ ave them ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed , and they ris@@ k ex@@ plo@@ it@@ ation and ab@@ use , and leave them un@@ sk@@ il@@ led and u@@ ne@@ duc@@ ated , and de@@ la@@ y by years the re@@ turn to pe@@ ace and pros@@ per@@ ity in their countries ."
I believe how we tre@@ at the u@@ pro@@ ot@@ ed will shap@@ e the future of our world .
"The v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of war can hold the ke@@ ys to las@@ ting pe@@ ace , and it &apos;s the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es who can stop the cy@@ cle of violence ."
H@@ any is at a ti@@ p@@ ping point .
"We would love to help him go to uni@@ versity and to become an engine@@ er , but our fun@@ ds are pri@@ or@@ iti@@ z@@ ed for the bas@@ ics in life : ten@@ ts and b@@ lan@@ ke@@ ts and mat@@ tre@@ s@@ ses and k@@ it@@ ch@@ en se@@ ts , food ra@@ tions and a bit of me@@ dic@@ ine ."
Uni@@ versity is a lu@@ x@@ u@@ ry .
"But leave him to langu@@ ish in this mu@@ d@@ dy field , and he will become a mem@@ ber of a lost gener@@ ation ."
"H@@ any &apos;s story is a tra@@ ge@@ dy , but it doesn &apos;t have to end that way ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"That cul@@ pri@@ t is business and indus@@ try , which happens to be where I have spent the last 5@@ 2 years since my gra@@ du@@ ation from G@@ e@@ or@@ gia T@@ e@@ ch in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."

"I thought about the charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of first indus@@ tri@@ al re@@ vol@@ ution , T@@ 1 , as we prac@@ tic@@ ed it at In@@ ter@@ face , and it had the follo@@ wing charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics ."
Ex@@ tra@@ ctive : taking ra@@ w materi@@ als from the ear@@ th .
"L@@ in@@ e@@ ar : take , make , was@@ te ."
Po@@ wer@@ ed by f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ el@@ -@@ der@@ i@@ ved energy .
W@@ as@@ te@@ ful : ab@@ u@@ sive and focu@@ sed on lab@@ or produc@@ tivity .
M@@ ore car@@ pe@@ t per man@@ -@@ h@@ our .
We have measu@@ red our pro@@ gre@@ ss very ri@@ go@@ ro@@ us@@ ly .
So I can tell you how far we have come in the en@@ su@@ ing 12 years .
N@@ et gre@@ en@@ house g@@ as e@@ mis@@ sions down 8@@ 2 percent in absolu@@ te ton@@ n@@ age .
( Applause ) O@@ ver the same sp@@ an of time sal@@ es have incre@@ as@@ ed by tw@@ o-@@ th@@ ir@@ ds and pro@@ f@@ its have d@@ ou@@ b@@ led .
"@@ R@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able or rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able materi@@ als are 25 percent of the to@@ tal , and growing rap@@ id@@ ly ."
"And it has been a powerful marke@@ t@@ place differ@@ enti@@ ato@@ r , incre@@ as@@ ing sal@@ es and pro@@ f@@ its ."
We call this M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ ero .
And this is perhaps the most important fac@@ et : we have found M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ ero to be incredi@@ bly good for business .
This has pai@@ d all the cos@@ ts for the trans@@ formation of In@@ ter@@ face .
"And this dis@@ pe@@ ls a my@@ th too , this fal@@ se choice between the environment and the economy ."
And the go@@ od@@ will of the marke@@ t@@ place is as@@ ton@@ is@@ hing .
"N@@ o amount of ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ing , no cle@@ ver marke@@ ting cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n , at any pri@@ ce , could have produc@@ ed or created this much go@@ od@@ will ."
It is a better business model .
But the marke@@ t@@ place was down 3@@ 6 percent .
We liter@@ ally g@@ ain@@ ed market share .
"If every business were pur@@ su@@ ing In@@ ter@@ face plan@@ s , would that solve all our problems ?"
I don &apos;t think so .
"That A is a cap@@ ital A , sug@@ g@@ es@@ ting that af@@ flu@@ ence is an end in itself ."
But what if we re@@ fra@@ med E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch fu@@ r@@ ther ?
But does the ear@@ th have to wa@@ it for our ex@@ tin@@ ction as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
"We can see our way now , cle@@ ar to the top of that m@@ oun@@ tain ."
And now the challenge is in exe@@ cu@@ tion .
"And as my good friend and ad@@ vis@@ er A@@ mor@@ y Lo@@ vin@@ s says , &quot; If something exis@@ ts , it must be possible . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible ."
"If we , a pe@@ tro@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive company can do it , any@@ body can ."
But let me in@@ tro@@ duce you to the one who is most at ris@@ k here .
"@@ Here is what G@@ len@@ n w@@ ro@@ te . And here is that person , most at ris@@ k ."
A w@@ ise friend in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed us two .
"And through his so@@ ber@@ ing point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me ."
K@@ no@@ wing you has changed my thinking .
"B@@ eg@@ in , I will ."
"The way the cost of what I squ@@ an@@ der , what is lost , if ever I for@@ get that you will some@@ day come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; T@@ omor@@ row &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ d &quot; &quot; has spo@@ k@@ en to me with one simple but pro@@ found mess@@ age , which I pre@@ su@@ me to share with you ."
"The contin@@ u@@ um of human@@ ity , sure , but in a lar@@ ger sense , the we@@ b of life itself ."
"For you , it &apos;s your call ."
Thank you .
