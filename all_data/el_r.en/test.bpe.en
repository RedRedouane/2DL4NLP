"B@@ y the end of this year , there &apos;ll be ne@@ ar@@ ly a billion people on this planet that ac@@ tively use social net@@ working s@@ ites ."
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
"Wh@@ ile that might be a some@@ what mor@@ bi@@ d thought , I think it has some really pro@@ found im@@ plic@@ ations that are wor@@ th expl@@ or@@ ing ."
"What first got me thinking about this was a blo@@ g po@@ st au@@ thor@@ ed ear@@ li@@ er this year by D@@ ere@@ k K@@ . Mil@@ ler , who was a science and technology jour@@ n@@ alis@@ t who died of cancer ."
And what Mil@@ ler did was have his family and friends write a po@@ st that went out shor@@ tly after he died .
Here &apos;s what he w@@ ro@@ te in star@@ ting that out .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m de@@ ad , and this is my last po@@ st to my blo@@ g ."
"In advan@@ ce , I asked that once my body finally sh@@ ut down from the p@@ un@@ is@@ h@@ ments of my cancer , then my family and friends pub@@ lish this pre@@ par@@ ed mess@@ age I w@@ ro@@ te — the first part of the process of tur@@ ning this from an ac@@ tive w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite to an arch@@ i@@ ve . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a jour@@ n@@ alis@@ t , Mil@@ ler &apos;s arch@@ i@@ ve may have been better w@@ rit@@ ten and more care@@ fully cu@@ ra@@ ted than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are cre@@ ating an arch@@ i@@ ve that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any pre@@ vi@@ ous gener@@ ation ."
Con@@ si@@ der a few sta@@ ts for a moment .
Right now there are 4@@ 8 hours of video being up@@ lo@@ a@@ ded to Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be every single minu@@ te .
There are 200 million T@@ we@@ ets being pos@@ ted every day .
And the a@@ verage F@@ ace@@ book u@@ ser is cre@@ ating 90 pie@@ ces of con@@ tent each mon@@ th .
"So when you think about your parents or your grand@@ parents , at best they may have created some pho@@ tos or home vide@@ os , or a di@@ ary that lives in a box some@@ where ."
"But today we &apos;re all cre@@ ating this incredi@@ bly ri@@ ch digital arch@@ i@@ ve that &apos;s going to live in the cl@@ ou@@ d in@@ defin@@ i@@ tely , years after we &apos;re gone ."
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredi@@ bly in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties for techno@@ logis@@ ts .
"Now to be cle@@ ar , I &apos;m a jour@@ n@@ alis@@ t and not a techno@@ logis@@ t , so what I &apos;d like to do bri@@ ef@@ ly is pain@@ t a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like ."
Now we &apos;re already seeing some serv@@ ices that are desig@@ ned to let us deci@@ de what happens to our on@@ line pro@@ fil@@ e and our social media ac@@ coun@@ ts after we die .
"One of them actually , f@@ it@@ tin@@ g@@ ly enough , found me when I che@@ c@@ ked into a de@@ li at a re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant in New York on f@@ our@@ squ@@ are ."
( Re@@ cor@@ ding ) A@@ da@@ m O@@ stro@@ w : H@@ el@@ lo .
De@@ ath : A@@ da@@ m ?
A@@ O : Yeah .
"D@@ e@@ ath : De@@ ath can c@@ at@@ ch you any@@ where , any@@ time , even at the O@@ r@@ gan@@ ic ."
A@@ O : Wh@@ o is this ?
De@@ ath : G@@ o to i@@ fi@@ di@@ e@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too late .
"( Laughter ) A@@ da@@ m O@@ stro@@ w : K@@ ind of cre@@ ep@@ y , right ?"
"So what that serv@@ ice does , quite simply , is let you create a mess@@ age or a video that can be pos@@ ted to F@@ ace@@ book after you die ."
"A@@ no@@ ther serv@@ ice right now is called 1@@ ,000 Me@@ mor@@ ies ."
"And what this le@@ ts you do is create an on@@ line tribu@@ te to your lo@@ ved ones , comple@@ te with pho@@ tos and vide@@ os and stories that they can po@@ st after you die ."
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
"Now a lot of you are probably fami@@ li@@ ar with De@@ b R@@ oy who , back in Mar@@ ch , de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ted how he was able to analy@@ ze more than 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video ."
"I think as mach@@ ines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vas@@ t amoun@@ ts of data contin@@ ues to impro@@ ve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analy@@ ze an entire life &apos;s wor@@ th of con@@ tent — the T@@ we@@ ets , the pho@@ tos , the vide@@ os , the blo@@ g pos@@ ts — that we &apos;re produc@@ ing in such mas@@ sive numbers ."
"And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital person@@ as to contin@@ ue to inter@@ act in the real world long after we &apos;re gone than@@ ks to the vas@@ t@@ ness of the amount of con@@ tent we &apos;re cre@@ ating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all ."
Now we &apos;re already star@@ ting to see some experi@@ ments here .
"One serv@@ ice called My N@@ ex@@ t T@@ we@@ et analy@@ z@@ es your entire T@@ wit@@ ter stre@@ am , everything you &apos;ve pos@@ ted on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , to make some pre@@ dic@@ tions as to what you might say next ."
"Well right now , as you can see , the resul@@ ts can be some@@ what com@@ ical ."
"You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our techn@@ ical cap@@ ab@@ ili@@ ties impro@@ ve ."
"T@@ aking it a step fu@@ r@@ ther , M@@ I@@ T &apos;s media la@@ b is working on ro@@ bot@@ s that can inter@@ act more like humans ."
But what if those ro@@ bot@@ s were able to inter@@ act based on the uni@@ qu@@ e charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of a speci@@ fic person based on the hundre@@ ds of thousands of pie@@ ces of con@@ tent that person produc@@ es in their li@@ fe@@ time ?
"F@@ in@@ ally , think back to this f@@ am@@ ous s@@ cen@@ e from ele@@ ction night 200@@ 8 back in the United States , where C@@ N@@ N be@@ a@@ med a live ho@@ log@@ ra@@ m of hi@@ p ho@@ p arti@@ st w@@ ill@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ am into their stu@@ dio for an inter@@ view with An@@ der@@ son C@@ o@@ o@@ per ."
What if we were able to use that same ty@@ pe of technology to be@@ am a re@@ presen@@ tation of our lo@@ ved ones into our living ro@@ om@@ s — inter@@ ac@@ ting in a very li@@ fel@@ ike way based on all the con@@ tent they created while they were ali@@ ve ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re produc@@ ing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both ex@@ p@@ and ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally .
"Now in clo@@ sing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a defin@@ i@@ tion of life and everything that comes after it ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
T@@ o@@ day I &apos;m going to talk about u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted disco@@ ver@@ ies .
Now I work in the sol@@ ar technology indus@@ try .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to for@@ ce ourselves into the environment by pa@@ ying atten@@ tion to ...
... pa@@ ying atten@@ tion to cro@@ w@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
It &apos;s just a quic@@ k video of what we do .
H@@ u@@ h . H@@ an@@ g on a moment .
It might take a moment to lo@@ ad .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just sk@@ i@@ p — I &apos;ll just sk@@ i@@ p through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
S@@ ol@@ ar technology is ...
"O@@ h , that &apos;s all my time ?"
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It was an af@@ ter@@ no@@ on in the f@@ all of 200@@ 5 .
I was working at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U as the organ@@ ization &apos;s science ad@@ vis@@ or .
So I wan@@ der@@ ed down the h@@ all@@ way to my colle@@ ag@@ ue Ch@@ ris H@@ an@@ se@@ n &apos;s off@@ ice .
"@@ Ch@@ ris had been at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U for more than 30 years , so he had de@@ ep institu@@ tional knowledge and in@@ si@@ ghts ."
I expl@@ ain@@ ed to Ch@@ ris that I was feel@@ ing a little bit stu@@ ck .
"So Ch@@ ris c@@ ut right to the ch@@ ase , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the issu@@ es you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s gene@@ tic dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation , and re@@ produc@@ tive technologies , and bi@@ ob@@ an@@ king , and ..@@ ."
"&quot; Yes , you know , pa@@ ten@@ ts on human gen@@ es . &quot;"
"And 20 minutes later , he came bur@@ s@@ ting in my off@@ ice ."
So c@@ lear@@ ly we had a lot to learn before we could fil@@ e a la@@ w@@ su@@ it .
So what does that mean ?
It also means that the pa@@ tent h@@ ol@@ der has the right to stop any@@ one from using that gen@@ e in research or c@@ lin@@ ical tes@@ ting .
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der A@@ big@@ ai@@ l , a 10@@ -@@ year-@@ old with long Q@@ T syn@@ dro@@ me , a ser@@ i@@ ous heart condi@@ tion that , if left un@@ tre@@ ated , can resul@@ t in su@@ d@@ den death ."
But then they went ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt and they never of@@ fer@@ ed it .
G@@ en@@ e pa@@ ten@@ ts c@@ lear@@ ly were a problem and were har@@ ming pati@@ ents .
"You can &apos;t pa@@ tent produc@@ ts of nature — the air , the water , min@@ er@@ als , ele@@ ments of the peri@@ odi@@ c table ."
Why is that ?
"Well , the pa@@ tent off@@ ice had been issu@@ ing these pa@@ ten@@ ts for more than 20 years ."
There were liter@@ ally thousands of pa@@ ten@@ ts on human gen@@ es .
So the bot@@ to@@ m line : cour@@ ts just wer@@ en &apos;t going to be wil@@ ling to over@@ turn these pa@@ ten@@ ts .
"Now , n@@ either Ch@@ ris no@@ r I were the ty@@ pe to sh@@ y away from a challenge , and hear@@ ing , &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; see@@ med all the more reason to take on this fi@@ ght ."
So we set out to build our case .
It had for@@ ced mul@@ ti@@ ple lab@@ s that were of@@ fer@@ ing B@@ R@@ C@@ A tes@@ ting to stop .
This is K@@ ath@@ le@@ en M@@ ax@@ ian .
The test was ne@@ ga@@ tive .
The family was reli@@ ev@@ ed .
It turned out that K@@ ath@@ le@@ en &apos;s sis@@ ter was a@@ mon@@ g the 12 percent who rec@@ ei@@ ved a fal@@ se@@ -@@ ne@@ ga@@ tive test resul@@ t .
One of the maj@@ or challen@@ ges we had in pre@@ par@@ ing the case was figu@@ ring out how best to communic@@ ate the science .
"So now it &apos;s 200@@ 9 , and we &apos;re ready to fil@@ e our case ."
"We fi@@ led in fe@@ der@@ al cour@@ t in the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n D@@ is@@ tri@@ ct of New York , and the case was ran@@ dom@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned to J@@ u@@ dge R@@ ob@@ er@@ t S@@ we@@ et ."
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad then appe@@ al@@ ed to the U@@ S C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ e@@ der@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it .
And here things got really interesting .
"F@@ ir@@ st , in a pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al moment of this case , the U@@ S government s@@ wit@@ ched si@@ des ."
So in the dis@@ tri@@ ct cour@@ t the government sub@@ mit@@ ted a bri@@ ef on M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s side .
S@@ or@@ t of .
"En@@ ds up s@@ pli@@ t decis@@ ion , 2 to 1 ."
So now we s@@ ou@@ ght re@@ view by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
We sub@@ mit@@ ted perhaps the shor@@ test question presen@@ ted ever .
F@@ our words : A@@ re human gen@@ es pa@@ ten@@ table ?
I was c@@ lear@@ ly more ner@@ v@@ ous than he was .
The argu@@ ment itself was ri@@ ve@@ ting .
Ch@@ ris argu@@ ed bri@@ l@@ li@@ an@@ tly .
J@@ us@@ tice K@@ ag@@ an lik@@ en@@ ed is@@ ol@@ ating DNA to extra@@ cting a me@@ dic@@ in@@ al pl@@ ant from the A@@ maz@@ on .
J@@ us@@ tice R@@ ob@@ er@@ ts dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ is@@ hed it from car@@ ving a bas@@ eb@@ all b@@ at from a tre@@ e .
S@@ ome of them pro@@ mis@@ ed to of@@ fer the tes@@ ts at a lo@@ wer pri@@ ce than M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s .
But of course the decis@@ ion goes far be@@ y@@ ond M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
It c@@ lear@@ s a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant bar@@ ri@@ er to bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal disco@@ very and innov@@ ation .
"And it hel@@ ps to en@@ sure that pati@@ ents like A@@ big@@ ai@@ l , K@@ ath@@ le@@ en and Ei@@ le@@ en have access to the tes@@ ts that they need ."
"A few we@@ eks after the cour@@ t issu@@ ed its decis@@ ion , I rec@@ ei@@ ved a small p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ge in the ma@@ il ."
I open@@ ed it up to find a small stu@@ f@@ f@@ ed anima@@ l .
( Laughter ) We took a big ris@@ k in taking this case .
The second quot@@ e is from the head of the U@@ K F@@ in@@ an@@ cial S@@ er@@ v@@ ices Au@@ thor@@ ity .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ na@@ tely , the answer is y@@ es ."
"Th@@ en , pre@@ dic@@ tions can be made and tes@@ ted ."
So what do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole is liter@@ ally more than the su@@ m of its parts .
Wh@@ ere are economic net@@ works ?
What we looked at in de@@ tai@@ l was ow@@ ner@@ ship net@@ works .
And we also as@@ sig@@ n a val@@ ue to the company given by the oper@@ ating re@@ ven@@ ue .
How are they organ@@ ized ? A@@ re they is@@ ol@@ ated ?
"Th@@ ese are companies that oper@@ ate in more than one country , and we found 4@@ 3@@ ,000 ."
Let me expl@@ ain by giving you this anal@@ og@@ y .
"H@@ i . T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m going to take you through g@@ lim@@ ps@@ es of about eight of my pro@@ jects , done in col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation with D@@ anis@@ h arti@@ st S@@ or@@ en P@@ ors ."
"We call ourselves P@@ ors and R@@ ao , and we live and work in India ."
"I &apos;d like to beg@@ in with my very first ob@@ ject , which I call &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was inspi@@ red by my un@@ cle &apos;s pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ha@@ bit of con@@ stan@@ tly as@@ king me to do things for him , almost like I were an ex@@ ten@@ sion of his body — to turn on the li@@ ghts or to bring him a g@@ las@@ s of water , a p@@ ack of ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ tes ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , it became wor@@ se and wor@@ se , And I started to think of it as a form of control ."
"But of course , I could never say anything , because the un@@ cle is a re@@ spe@@ cted figure in the In@@ di@@ an family ."
And the sit@@ u@@ ation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ sti@@ fi@@ ed me the most was his use of a lan@@ d@@ line tele@@ phone .
He would hold on to the rec@@ ei@@ ver and expe@@ ct me to di@@ al a number for him .
"And so as a respon@@ se and as a gi@@ ft to my un@@ cle , I made him &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es two people to use it ."
It &apos;s exactly the way my un@@ cle us@@ es a phone that &apos;s desig@@ ned for one person .
"But the problem is that , when I left home and went to colle@@ ge , I started m@@ iss@@ ing his com@@ man@@ ds ."
And so I made him a g@@ ol@@ den ty@@ pe@@ wri@@ ter through which he could dis@@ pen@@ se his com@@ man@@ ds to n@@ ep@@ he@@ ws and ni@@ e@@ ces around the world as an ema@@ il .
"So what he had to do was take a piece of pap@@ er , ro@@ ll it into the car@@ ri@@ age , ty@@ pe his ema@@ il or comm@@ and and pu@@ ll the pap@@ er out ."
This dev@@ ice would auto@@ mati@@ cally sen@@ d the in@@ ten@@ ded person the le@@ tter as an ema@@ il .
"So here you can see , we em@@ be@@ d@@ ded a lot of elec@@ tron@@ ics that under@@ stan@@ ds all of the me@@ chan@@ ical ac@@ tions and con@@ ver@@ ts it to digital ."
So my un@@ cle is only de@@ al@@ ing with a me@@ chan@@ ical inter@@ face .
"And of course , the ob@@ ject had to be very g@@ r@@ and and have a sense of rit@@ u@@ alis@@ m , the way my un@@ cle lik@@ es it ."
"The next work is a soun@@ d-@@ sen@@ si@@ tive in@@ st@@ alla@@ tion that we af@@ fe@@ c@@ tion@@ a@@ tely call &quot; &quot; The P@@ yg@@ mi@@ es . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a no@@ tion of being sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sen@@ si@@ tive and s@@ we@@ et crea@@ tures ."
"So how it works is we have these pan@@ el@@ s , which we have on the w@@ all , and behind them , we have these little crea@@ tures which hi@@ de ."
"And as so@@ on as it &apos;s sil@@ ent , they sort of cre@@ ep out ."
"And if it &apos;s even more sil@@ ent , they stre@@ t@@ ch their ne@@ cks out ."
"And at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hi@@ de back again ."
So we had these pan@@ el@@ s on three w@@ alls of a room .
And we had over 500 of these little p@@ yg@@ mi@@ es h@@ id@@ ing behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video proto@@ ty@@ pe .
"So when it &apos;s qui@@ et , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the pan@@ el@@ s ."
"And they hear like humans do , or real crea@@ tures do ."
So they get im@@ m@@ un@@ e to soun@@ ds that s@@ care them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t re@@ act to bac@@ k@@ ground soun@@ ds .
You &apos;ll hear a tra@@ in in moment that they don &apos;t re@@ act to .
( No@@ ise ) But they re@@ act to for@@ eg@@ ro@@ und soun@@ ds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( Wh@@ is@@ t@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as li@@ fel@@ ike as possible .
"So each p@@ yg@@ my has its own behavior , psy@@ ch@@ e , mo@@ od s@@ win@@ gs , person@@ ali@@ ties and so on ."
So this is a very early proto@@ ty@@ pe .
"O@@ f course , it got much better after that ."
"And we made them re@@ act to people , but we found that people were being quite play@@ ful and chil@@ d@@ like with them ."
This is a video in@@ st@@ alla@@ tion called &quot; &quot; The M@@ iss@@ ing Per@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with pla@@ ying with the no@@ tion of in@@ visi@@ bility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of in@@ visi@@ bility ?
"So we worked with a company that speci@@ al@@ iz@@ es in ca@@ mera sur@@ v@@ ei@@ l@@ lan@@ ce , and we asked them to develo@@ p a piece of so@@ f@@ tw@@ are with us , using a ca@@ mera that could look at people in the room , tra@@ ck them and re@@ place one person with the bac@@ k@@ ground , ren@@ der@@ ing them in@@ visi@@ ble ."
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early proto@@ ty@@ pe .
"O@@ n the right side you can see my colle@@ ag@@ ue S@@ or@@ en , who &apos;s actually in the space ."
"And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the pro@@ ces@@ sed video where the ca@@ mera has made him in@@ visi@@ ble ."
S@@ or@@ en en@@ ters the room . Po@@ p ! He goes in@@ visi@@ ble .
And you can see that the ca@@ mera is tra@@ c@@ king him and eras@@ ing .
"It &apos;s a very early video , so we ha@@ ven &apos;t yet de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty so@@ on , later ."
"So how we used it was in a room where we had a ca@@ mera looking into the space , and we had one mon@@ i@@ tor , one on each w@@ all ."
"And as people wal@@ ked into the room , they would see themselves in the mon@@ i@@ tor , ex@@ cept with one difference : one person was con@@ stan@@ tly in@@ visi@@ ble wh@@ er@@ ever they mo@@ ved in the room ."
"So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Su@@ n S@@ ha@@ do@@ w . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sh@@ e@@ et of pap@@ er , like a cu@@ to@@ ut of a chil@@ d@@ like dra@@ wing of an o@@ il sp@@ ill or a su@@ n ."
"And from the front , this ob@@ ject appe@@ ar@@ ed to be very st@@ rong and ro@@ b@@ ust , and from the side , it almost see@@ med very we@@ ak ."
"So people would wal@@ king into the room and they &apos;d almost ig@@ nor@@ e it , thinking it was some cra@@ p la@@ ying around ."
"But as so@@ on as they pas@@ sed by , it would start to cli@@ m@@ b up the w@@ all in j@@ er@@ k@@ y fas@@ h@@ ion ."
"And it would get ex@@ h@@ au@@ s@@ ted , and it would col@@ lap@@ se every time ."
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ ic@@ a@@ ture of an upsi@@ de@@ -@@ down man .
"H@@ is head is so he@@ av@@ y , full of he@@ av@@ y thou@@ ghts , that it &apos;s sort of fal@@ le@@ n into his h@@ at , and his body &apos;s gro@@ wn out of him almost like a pl@@ ant ."
Well what he does is he mo@@ ves around in a very d@@ run@@ k@@ en fas@@ h@@ ion on his head in a very un@@ pre@@ dic@@ table and extre@@ me@@ ly s@@ low movement .
And it &apos;s kind of con@@ stra@@ ined by that cir@@ cle .
"Because if that cir@@ cle wer@@ en &apos;t there , and the flo@@ or was very even , it would start to wan@@ der about in the space ."
And there &apos;s no w@@ ir@@ es .
"So I &apos;ll just show you an in@@ stan@@ ce — so when people en@@ ter the room , it ac@@ tiv@@ ates this ob@@ ject ."
"And it very s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , over a few minutes , sort of pain@@ fully goes up , and then it g@@ ain@@ s mo@@ men@@ tu@@ m and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to f@@ all ."
"And this is an important moment , because we wanted to in@@ still in the vie@@ wer an in@@ s@@ tin@@ ct to almost go and help , or sa@@ ve the sub@@ ject ."
"But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ages to pu@@ ll itself up ."
"So this work was a real techn@@ ical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the me@@ chan@@ ics right and the equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um and the dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs ."
"And it was very important for us to es@@ tab@@ lish the ex@@ act moment that it would f@@ all , because if we made it in a way that it would top@@ ple over , then it would da@@ ma@@ ge itself , and if it didn &apos;t f@@ all enough , it wouldn &apos;t in@@ still that fa@@ tal@@ ism , or that sense of wan@@ ting to go and help it ."
So I &apos;m going to show you a very quic@@ k video where we are doing a test s@@ cen@@ ar@@ io — it &apos;s much fas@@ ter .
That &apos;s my colle@@ ag@@ ue . He &apos;s let it go .
"Now he &apos;s getting ner@@ v@@ ous , so he &apos;s going to go c@@ at@@ ch it ."
"But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ages to li@@ ft itself up on its own ."
"So this is a work that we were very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with , working with the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic of fu@@ r em@@ be@@ d@@ ded with thousands of tin@@ y different si@@ z@@ es of fi@@ ber op@@ tics , which tw@@ in@@ k@@ le like the night sk@@ y ."
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sk@@ y .
"So we w@@ rap@@ ped this around a blo@@ b@@ -@@ like form , which is in the shap@@ e of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which was h@@ ang@@ ing from the c@@ ei@@ ling ."
"And the idea was to sort of con@@ tr@@ ast something very col@@ d and dis@@ tant and ab@@ stra@@ ct like the universe into the fami@@ li@@ ar form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which is very com@@ for@@ ting and in@@ ti@@ mate ."
"And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar and you would almost per@@ c@@ ei@@ ve it to be a h@@ ole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling night sk@@ y ."
"So this is the last work , and a work in pro@@ gre@@ ss , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ace F@@ il@@ ler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you appro@@ ach@@ ed it , it tried to in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ate you by growing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s tw@@ ice its h@@ eight and &#91; eight &#93; times its vol@@ u@@ me ."
And so this ob@@ ject is con@@ stan@@ tly ex@@ pan@@ ding and con@@ tra@@ cting to create a dy@@ na@@ mic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a se@@ cre@@ t within its se@@ am@@ s or something .
"So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gi@@ ves us a lot of pa@@ in in our work over years and years ."
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to ex@@ pre@@ ss the emo@@ tions and behavi@@ or@@ al patter@@ ns in these crea@@ tures that we create .
"And once a crea@@ ture po@@ ps into our min@@ ds , it &apos;s almost like the process of cre@@ ation is to disco@@ ver the way this crea@@ ture really wan@@ ts to exis@@ t and what form it wan@@ ts to take and what way it wan@@ ts to move ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m really g@@ la@@ d to be here .
I &apos;m g@@ la@@ d we &apos;re all here .
"And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here ."
"The interesting thing is , Earth is the only place we know of that has life — 8@@ .@@ 7 million species ."
I@@ s Earth speci@@ al ?
"O@@ n one side , all life on Earth needs energy ."
"C@@ om@@ ple@@ x life like us der@@ i@@ ves our energy from the su@@ n , but life de@@ ep un@@ d@@ erg@@ ro@@ und can get its energy from things like che@@ mi@@ cal re@@ ac@@ tions ."
"And this see@@ ms like a t@@ all order , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally if you want a suc@@ cul@@ ent to@@ ma@@ to ."
"So that le@@ av@@ es the thing in the middle as the t@@ all po@@ le , the thing that &apos;s har@@ de@@ st to ach@@ i@@ eve ."
"N@@ ot mo@@ ose , but water ."
( Laughter ) Al@@ though mo@@ ose would be pretty co@@ ol . ( Laughter )
"And not fro@@ z@@ en water , and not water in a g@@ as@@ e@@ ous state , but li@@ qui@@ d water ."
"This is what life needs to sur@@ vi@@ ve , all life ."
"And many sol@@ ar system bo@@ dies don &apos;t have li@@ qui@@ d water , and so we don &apos;t look there ."
So that le@@ av@@ es a few bo@@ dies that we should think about .
So let &apos;s make the problem sim@@ ple@@ r for ourselves .
Let &apos;s think only about li@@ qui@@ d water on the sur@@ face of a planet .
You want to have an at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here for water to be li@@ qui@@ d .
"You can &apos;t have too much at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , too th@@ ic@@ k or too war@@ m an at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , because then you end up too ho@@ t like V@@ en@@ us , and you can &apos;t have li@@ qui@@ d water ."
"But if you have too little at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here and it &apos;s too th@@ in and too col@@ d , you end up like Mar@@ s , too col@@ d ."
"So V@@ en@@ us is too ho@@ t , Mar@@ s is too col@@ d , and Earth is just right ."
You can look at these images behind me and you can see auto@@ mati@@ cally where life can sur@@ vi@@ ve in our sol@@ ar system .
O@@ r could it have been just right at some other time ?
Wh@@ en G@@ ol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks wal@@ ks into the room de@@ ter@@ mines the answer that we get in the story .
And the same is true with plan@@ ets .
They &apos;re not sta@@ tic things . They change .
And at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ es do the same .
So let me give you an example .
This can &apos;t happen on Mar@@ s today .
"This one image tel@@ ls you that the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here of Mar@@ s changed , and it changed in big ways ."
"And it changed from a state that we would defin@@ e as ha@@ b@@ it@@ able , because the three re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments for life were present long ago ."
And this happens with all bo@@ dies with at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ es .
C@@ ome@@ ts have ta@@ il@@ s that are incredi@@ bly visi@@ ble re@@ min@@ ders of at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic es@@ cap@@ e .
"But V@@ en@@ us also has an at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here that es@@ cap@@ es with time , and Mar@@ s and Earth as well ."
It &apos;s just a matter of de@@ gre@@ e and a matter of scale .
"@@ Yes , I &apos;m dan@@ cing , but they — ( Laughter ) Oh my God , not even at my we@@ d@@ ding . ( Laughter )"
A second way they can get energy is from the sol@@ ar win@@ d .
"If P@@ ap@@ a Be@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too ho@@ t , and Ma@@ ma Be@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too col@@ d , sh@@ ouldn &apos;t B@@ ab@@ y Be@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l be even col@@ der if we &apos;re follo@@ wing the tr@@ end ?"
"This thing that you &apos;ve ac@@ cep@@ ted your entire life , when you think about it a little bit more , may not be so simple ."
"And of course , dis@@ tance of a planet from the su@@ n de@@ ter@@ mines its tem@@ per@@ a@@ ture ."
This has to play into ha@@ b@@ it@@ ability .
But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
Earth has one ; V@@ en@@ us and Mar@@ s do not .
M@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds are gener@@ ated in the de@@ ep inter@@ i@@ or of a planet by electri@@ cally con@@ duc@@ ting ch@@ ur@@ ning flu@@ id materi@@ al that cre@@ ates this big old mag@@ ne@@ tic field that sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ds Earth .
"If you have a com@@ pas@@ s , you know which way nor@@ th is ."
( Laughter ) D@@ o@@ es this in@@ flu@@ ence ha@@ b@@ it@@ ability ?
"Well , how might it ?"
I like to think of it instead as a sal@@ ad b@@ ar s@@ nee@@ ze gu@@ ard for plan@@ ets .
A@@ t@@ mo@@ sp@@ here h@@ as@@ n &apos;t been able to es@@ cap@@ e .
"If you &apos;ve ever experi@@ en@@ ced them , it &apos;s mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent ."
We know the energy is getting in .
We &apos;re trying to measu@@ re how many par@@ tic@@ les are getting out and if the mag@@ ne@@ tic field is in@@ flu@@ en@@ cing this in any way .
We don &apos;t have a solution .
But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
"Well , we &apos;ve s@@ ent sp@@ ace@@ cra@@ ft to all three plan@@ ets ."
We have si@@ mil@@ ar measu@@ re@@ ments from V@@ en@@ us and Earth .
"O@@ n@@ ce we have that answer , why should you care ?"
"And fin@@ an@@ ci@@ ally as well , but de@@ ep@@ ly ."
It will te@@ ach us about at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ es that sur@@ ro@@ und us and that are close .
"In ad@@ di@@ tion to that , esti@@ ma@@ tes sug@@ gest there are some@@ where between 40 billion and 100 billion of those plan@@ ets that we would defin@@ e as ha@@ b@@ it@@ able in just our gal@@ ax@@ y ."
"You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet ."
"This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s ha@@ b@@ it@@ able , al@@ though very so@@ on we may come to know of more ."
I &apos;m really g@@ la@@ d we &apos;re here .
Th@@ an@@ ks .
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Th@@ in@@ k about everything it has bro@@ ught us .
"Th@@ in@@ k about all the serv@@ ices we use , all the conne@@ c@@ tivity , all the en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , all the business , all the com@@ mer@@ ce ."
And it &apos;s happening during our li@@ fe@@ times .
"I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be wri@@ ting history books hundre@@ ds of years from now . This time our gener@@ ation will be remem@@ ber@@ ed as the gener@@ ation that got on@@ line , the gener@@ ation that built something really and tru@@ ly global ."
"But y@@ es , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very ser@@ i@@ ous problems , problems with se@@ cur@@ ity and problems with p@@ riv@@ ac@@ y ."
I &apos;ve spent my care@@ er fi@@ gh@@ ting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is Bra@@ in .
This is a flo@@ p@@ py dis@@ k — five and a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ ch flo@@ p@@ py dis@@ k in@@ fe@@ cted by Bra@@ in@@ .@@ A@@ .
It &apos;s the first vir@@ us we ever found for P@@ C compu@@ ters .
And we actually know where Bra@@ in came from .
We know because it says so inside the co@@ de .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
"That &apos;s the bo@@ ot se@@ c@@ tor of an in@@ fe@@ cted flo@@ p@@ py , and if we take a clo@@ ser look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to the dun@@ ge@@ on . &quot; &quot; And then it contin@@ ues , saying , 19@@ 8@@ 6 , B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ."
"And B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad are first n@@ ames , P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan@@ i first n@@ ames ."
"In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an ad@@ dre@@ ss in P@@ ak@@ istan ."
"( Laughter ) Now , 19@@ 8@@ 6 ."
Now it &apos;s 20@@ 11 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The P@@ C vir@@ us problem is 25 years old now .
"So half a year ago , I decided to go to P@@ ak@@ istan myself ."
"So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of pho@@ tos I took while I was in P@@ ak@@ istan ."
"This is from the city of La@@ hor@@ e , which is around 3@@ 00 ki@@ lo@@ me@@ ters s@@ outh from A@@ b@@ bot@@ ta@@ bad , where B@@ in La@@ den was cau@@ ght ."
Here &apos;s a ty@@ pi@@ cal stre@@ et view .
"And here &apos;s the stre@@ et or ro@@ ad lead@@ ing to this building , which is 7@@ 30 N@@ iz@@ am blo@@ ck at Al@@ la@@ ma I@@ q@@ bal T@@ own ."
And I kno@@ c@@ ked on the do@@ or .
( Laughter ) You want to gu@@ ess who open@@ ed the do@@ or ?
B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ; they are still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is B@@ as@@ it .
S@@ it@@ ting down is his bro@@ ther A@@ m@@ j@@ ad .
These are the guys who w@@ ro@@ te the first P@@ C vir@@ us .
"Now of course , we had a very interesting dis@@ cus@@ sion ."
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion from learning that both B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad had had their compu@@ ters in@@ fe@@ cted do@@ z@@ ens of times by completely un@@ rela@@ ted other vi@@ rus@@ es over these years .
So there is some sort of j@@ us@@ tice in the world after all .
"Now , the vi@@ rus@@ es that we used to see in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s and 199@@ 0s obvi@@ ously are not a problem any more ."
So let me just show you a couple of exam@@ ples of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m run@@ ning here is a system that en@@ ab@@ les me to run ag@@ e-@@ old progra@@ ms on a mo@@ der@@ n computer .
So let me just m@@ oun@@ t some dri@@ ves . G@@ o over there .
What we have here is a lis@@ t of old vi@@ rus@@ es .
So let me just run some vi@@ rus@@ es on my computer .
"For example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de vir@@ us first ."
"And you can see at the top of the scre@@ en , there &apos;s a cen@@ ti@@ pe@@ de s@@ cro@@ l@@ ling across your computer when you get in@@ fe@@ cted by this one ."
You know that you &apos;re in@@ fe@@ cted because it actually sho@@ ws up .
"@@ Here &apos;s another one . This is the vir@@ us called C@@ ras@@ h , inven@@ ted in R@@ us@@ sia in 199@@ 2 ."
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
"( Si@@ re@@ n no@@ ise ) And the last example , gu@@ ess what the W@@ al@@ ker vir@@ us does ?"
"@@ Yes , there &apos;s a guy wal@@ king across your scre@@ en once you get in@@ fe@@ cted ."
"So it used to be fai@@ r@@ ly easy to know that you &apos;re in@@ fe@@ cted by a vir@@ us , when the vi@@ rus@@ es were w@@ rit@@ ten by ho@@ b@@ by@@ is@@ ts and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are no longer being w@@ rit@@ ten by ho@@ b@@ by@@ is@@ ts and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , vi@@ rus@@ es are a global problem ."
"What we have here in the bac@@ k@@ ground is an example of our systems that we run in our lab@@ s , where we tra@@ ck vir@@ us in@@ fe@@ ctions wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blo@@ c@@ ked vi@@ rus@@ es in S@@ we@@ den and T@@ ai@@ w@@ an and R@@ us@@ sia and el@@ se@@ where .
"In fact , if I just conne@@ ct back to our la@@ b systems through the W@@ e@@ b , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many vi@@ rus@@ es , how many new exam@@ ples of mal@@ w@@ are we find every single day ."
"@@ Here &apos;s the la@@ test vir@@ us we &apos;ve found , in a fil@@ e called S@@ er@@ ver@@ .@@ exe@@ ."
"And we found it right over here three secon@@ ds ago — the pre@@ vi@@ ous one , six secon@@ ds ago ."
"And if we just s@@ cro@@ ll around , it &apos;s just mas@@ sive ."
"We find ten@@ s of thousands , even hundre@@ ds of thousands ."
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of mal@@ w@@ are every single day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
"Well today , it &apos;s the organ@@ ized cri@@ min@@ al gan@@ gs wri@@ ting these vi@@ rus@@ es because they make money with their vi@@ rus@@ es ."
It &apos;s gan@@ gs like — let &apos;s go to G@@ ang@@ sta@@ B@@ uc@@ k@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
This is a w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite oper@@ ating in M@@ os@@ co@@ w where these guys are bu@@ ying in@@ fe@@ cted compu@@ ters .
"So if you are a vir@@ us wri@@ ter and you &apos;re cap@@ able of in@@ fe@@ cting W@@ in@@ do@@ ws compu@@ ters , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can se@@ ll those in@@ fe@@ cted compu@@ ters — somebody else &apos;s compu@@ ters — to these guys ."
And they &apos;ll actually p@@ ay you money for those compu@@ ters .
So how do these guys then mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze those in@@ fe@@ cted compu@@ ters ?
"Well there &apos;s mul@@ ti@@ ple different ways , such as ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your on@@ line ban@@ king ac@@ coun@@ ts when you do on@@ line ban@@ king , or ke@@ y@@ log@@ g@@ ers ."
"K@@ ey@@ log@@ g@@ ers si@@ len@@ tly si@@ t on your computer , h@@ id@@ den from view , and they recor@@ d everything you ty@@ pe ."
So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google se@@ arch@@ es .
E@@ very single Google se@@ arch you ty@@ pe is sav@@ ed and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
E@@ very single ema@@ il you write is sav@@ ed and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
S@@ ame thing with every single pas@@ s@@ word and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are se@@ s@@ sions where you go on@@ line and do on@@ line pu@@ rch@@ as@@ es in any on@@ line sto@@ re .
"Because when you do pu@@ rch@@ as@@ es in on@@ line s@@ tor@@ es , you will be ty@@ ping in your name , the deli@@ very ad@@ dre@@ ss , your cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d number and the cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d se@@ cur@@ ity co@@ des ."
And here &apos;s an example of a fil@@ e we found from a ser@@ ver a couple of we@@ eks ago .
"That &apos;s the cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d number , that &apos;s the ex@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion d@@ ate , that &apos;s the se@@ cur@@ ity co@@ de , and that &apos;s the name of the ow@@ ner of the car@@ d ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you g@@ ain access to other people &apos;s cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d information , you can just go on@@ line and bu@@ y whatever you want with this information ."
"And that , obvi@@ ously , is a problem ."
We now have a whole un@@ d@@ erg@@ ro@@ und marke@@ t@@ place and business e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m built around on@@ line cri@@ me .
One example of how these guys actually are cap@@ able of mon@@ e@@ tiz@@ ing their oper@@ ations : we go and have a look at the pag@@ es of I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L and se@@ arch for wanted per@@ s@@ ons .
"We find guys like B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ di@@ n , orig@@ in@@ ally from S@@ we@@ den , and his par@@ t@@ ner in cri@@ me , also lis@@ ted on the I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L wanted pag@@ es , M@@ r. S@@ h@@ ai@@ le@@ sh@@ ku@@ ma@@ r J@@ ain , a U.S. ci@@ tiz@@ en ."
"Th@@ ese guys were run@@ ning an oper@@ ation called I@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ U@@ . , a cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me oper@@ ation through which they net@@ ted mil@@ lions ."
They are both right now on the run .
No@@ body kno@@ ws where they are .
"@@ U.S. of@@ fici@@ als , just a couple of we@@ eks ago , fro@@ ze a S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t be@@ lon@@ ging to M@@ r. J@@ ain , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it ."
So the amount of money on@@ line cri@@ me gener@@ ates is sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant .
And that means that the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als can actually af@@ for@@ d to inv@@ est into their atta@@ cks .
"We know that on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are h@@ ir@@ ing program@@ mers , h@@ ir@@ ing tes@@ ting people , tes@@ ting their co@@ de , having bac@@ k@@ -@@ end systems with S@@ Q@@ L da@@ ta@@ bas@@ es ."
And they can af@@ for@@ d to wat@@ ch how we work — like how se@@ cur@@ ity people work — and try to work their way around any se@@ cur@@ ity pre@@ cau@@ tions we can build .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advan@@ ta@@ ge .
"I mean , the Internet is inter@@ national ."
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
"And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the on@@ line world , here &apos;s a video built by C@@ lar@@ i@@ fi@@ ed Ne@@ t@@ works , which ill@@ us@@ tra@@ tes how one single mal@@ w@@ are family is able to move around the world ."
"This oper@@ ation , beli@@ ev@@ ed to be orig@@ in@@ ally from E@@ sto@@ nia , mo@@ ves around from one country to another as so@@ on as the w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite is tried to sh@@ ut down ."
So you just can &apos;t sh@@ ut these guys down .
"They will s@@ wit@@ ch from one country to another , from one ju@@ ris@@ di@@ ction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability to glo@@ b@@ ally poli@@ ce oper@@ ations like this ."
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plan@@ e tic@@ ke@@ ts to all the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als of the world .
"Now , cri@@ min@@ als who wer@@ en &apos;t cap@@ able of re@@ ach@@ ing us before can re@@ ach us ."
So how do you actually go around fin@@ ding on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als ?
How do you actually tra@@ ck them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one ex@@ plo@@ it fil@@ e .
"@@ Here , I &apos;m looking at the H@@ e@@ x du@@ m@@ p of an image fil@@ e , which con@@ tain@@ s an ex@@ plo@@ it ."
"And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image fil@@ e on your W@@ in@@ do@@ ws computer , it actually takes over your computer and run@@ s co@@ de ."
"Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image fil@@ e — well there &apos;s the image he@@ a@@ der , and there the ac@@ tual co@@ de of the atta@@ ck star@@ ts ."
"And that co@@ de has been en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted , so let &apos;s dec@@ ry@@ pt it ."
It has been en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted with X@@ O@@ R fun@@ ction 9@@ 7 .
"You just have to believe me , it is , it is ."
And we can go here and actually start dec@@ ry@@ p@@ ting it .
Well the y@@ el@@ low part of the co@@ de is now dec@@ ry@@ p@@ ted .
"And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the orig@@ in@@ al ."
But just keep star@@ ing at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a W@@ e@@ b ad@@ dre@@ ss : uni@@ on@@ se@@ ek@@ .@@ co@@ m / d / io@@ o@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad and run that program .
And that &apos;s a bac@@ k@@ do@@ or which will take over your computer .
"But even more interes@@ tin@@ g@@ ly , if we contin@@ ue dec@@ ry@@ p@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this my@@ s@@ teri@@ ous str@@ ing , which says O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
That co@@ de is there under@@ ne@@ ath the en@@ c@@ ry@@ ption as some sort of a sig@@ nature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
"And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means ."
So obvi@@ ously I Goog@@ led for it .
I got z@@ ero h@@ its ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I spo@@ ke with the guys at the la@@ b .
"And we have a couple of R@@ us@@ si@@ an guys in our lab@@ s , and one of them men@@ tion@@ ed , well , it ends in R@@ U@@ S like R@@ us@@ sia ."
And 7@@ 8 is the city co@@ de for the city of S@@ t@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
"For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car li@@ cen@@ se pl@@ ates and stuff like that ."
"So I went looking for con@@ ta@@ cts in S@@ t@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , and through a long ro@@ ad , we ev@@ en@@ tually found this one particular w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite ."
"@@ Here &apos;s this R@@ us@@ si@@ an guy who &apos;s been oper@@ ating on@@ line for a number of years who run@@ s his own w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite , and he run@@ s a blo@@ g under the popu@@ lar Li@@ ve J@@ our@@ n@@ al ."
"And on this blo@@ g , he b@@ log@@ s about his life , about his life in S@@ t@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g — he &apos;s in his early 20@@ s — about his c@@ at , about his gir@@ l@@ friend ."
And he dri@@ ves a very n@@ ice car .
"In fact , this guy dri@@ ves a M@@ er@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ B@@ en@@ z S@@ 6@@ 00 V@@ 12 with a si@@ x@@ -@@ li@@ ter en@@ gine with more than 4@@ 00 hor@@ se@@ power ."
Now that &apos;s a n@@ ice car for a 20@@ -@@ something year-@@ old ki@@ d in S@@ t@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he b@@ log@@ ged about the car .
He actually had a car ac@@ ci@@ dent .
"In do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn S@@ t@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , he actually c@@ ras@@ hed his car into another car ."
And he put b@@ log@@ ged images about the car ac@@ ci@@ dent — that &apos;s his M@@ er@@ ce@@ des — right here is the L@@ ada S@@ am@@ ara he c@@ ras@@ hed into .
And you can actually see that the li@@ cen@@ se pl@@ ate of the S@@ am@@ ara ends in 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S .
"And if you actually take a look at the s@@ cen@@ e picture , you can see that the pl@@ ate of the M@@ er@@ ce@@ des is O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
"Now I &apos;m not a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are cau@@ ght ?"
Well in most cas@@ es it never gets this far .
"The vas@@ t maj@@ or@@ ity of the on@@ line cri@@ me cas@@ es , we don &apos;t even know which contin@@ ent the atta@@ cks are coming from ."
"And even if we are able to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als , quite often there is no out@@ come ."
"The local poli@@ ce don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evi@@ dence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down ."
I w@@ ish it would be eas@@ i@@ er ; un@@ for@@ tu@@ na@@ tely it isn &apos;t .
But things are also chan@@ ging at a very rap@@ id p@@ ace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like S@@ tu@@ x@@ net .
So if you look at what S@@ tu@@ x@@ net did is that it in@@ fe@@ cted these .
"That &apos;s a Si@@ e@@ men@@ s S@@ 7@@ -@@ 4@@ 00 P@@ L@@ C , program@@ ma@@ ble lo@@ gic &#91; contro@@ l@@ ler &#93; ."
And this is what run@@ s our in@@ fras@@ tr@@ uc@@ ture .
This is what run@@ s everything around us .
"P@@ L@@ C &apos;s , these small bo@@ x@@ es which have no dis@@ play , no ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard , which are program@@ med , are put in place , and they do their job ."
"For example , the ele@@ va@@ tors in this building most lik@@ ely are contro@@ l@@ led by one of these ."
"And when S@@ tu@@ x@@ net in@@ fe@@ cts one of these , that &apos;s a mas@@ sive re@@ vol@@ ution on the kinds of ris@@ ks we have to wor@@ ry about ."
Because everything around us is being run by these .
"I mean , we have cri@@ tical in@@ fras@@ tr@@ uc@@ ture ."
"You go to any fac@@ tory , any power pl@@ ant , any che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant , any food pro@@ cess@@ ing pl@@ ant , you look around — everything is being run by compu@@ ters ."
E@@ very@@ thing is being run by compu@@ ters .
E@@ very@@ thing is reli@@ ant on these compu@@ ters working .
"We have become very reli@@ ant on Internet , on bas@@ ic things like electri@@ city , obvi@@ ously , on compu@@ ters working ."
And this really is something which cre@@ ates completely new problems for us .
We must have some way of contin@@ u@@ ing to work even if compu@@ ters fai@@ l .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So pre@@ par@@ ed@@ ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for gran@@ ted ar@@ en &apos;t there .
"It &apos;s actually very bas@@ ic stuff — thinking about contin@@ u@@ ity , thinking about bac@@ k@@ up@@ s , thinking about the things that actually matter ."
Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
Th@@ in@@ k about all the serv@@ ices we have on@@ line .
"Th@@ in@@ k about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another ."
"I see beau@@ ty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m wor@@ ried that we might not see that ."
I &apos;m wor@@ ried that we are run@@ ning into problems because of on@@ line cri@@ me .
O@@ n@@ line cri@@ me is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life de@@ f@@ en@@ ding the N@@ et , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fi@@ ght on@@ line cri@@ me , we are run@@ ning a ris@@ k of lo@@ sing it all ."
"We have to do this glo@@ b@@ ally , and we have to do it right now ."
"What we need is more global , inter@@ national la@@ w en@@ for@@ ce@@ ment work to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ al gan@@ gs — these organ@@ ized gan@@ gs that are making mil@@ lions out of their atta@@ cks ."
That &apos;s much more important than run@@ ning anti@@ -@@ vi@@ rus@@ es or run@@ ning fi@@ re@@ w@@ alls .
"What actually mat@@ ters is actually fin@@ ding the people behind these atta@@ cks , and even more impor@@ tan@@ tly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this on@@ line world of cri@@ me , but ha@@ ven &apos;t yet done it ."
"We have to find the people with the sk@@ il@@ ls , but without the oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties and give them the oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties to use their sk@@ il@@ ls for good ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is chan@@ ging with really re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble spe@@ ed .
"If you look at the char@@ t at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 20@@ 25 , these G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s pro@@ je@@ ctions sug@@ gest that the Ch@@ in@@ ese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
"And if you look at the char@@ t for 20@@ 50 , it &apos;s pro@@ je@@ cted that the Ch@@ in@@ ese economy will be tw@@ ice the size of the American economy , and the In@@ di@@ an economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
And we should be@@ ar in mind here that these pro@@ je@@ ctions were dra@@ wn up before the W@@ ester@@ n fin@@ an@@ cial c@@ risis .
"A couple of we@@ eks ago , I was looking at the la@@ test pro@@ je@@ ction by B@@ N@@ P Par@@ i@@ b@@ as for when China will have a lar@@ ger economy than the United States ."
G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s pro@@ je@@ cted 20@@ 2@@ 7 .
The po@@ st@@ -@@ c@@ risis pro@@ je@@ ction is 20@@ 20 .
That &apos;s just a dec@@ ad@@ e away .
China is going to change the world in two fun@@ da@@ mental re@@ spe@@ cts .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s a huge develo@@ ping country with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year ."
"And within a dec@@ ad@@ e , it will have the lar@@ gest economy in the world ."
"N@@ ever before in the mo@@ der@@ n era has the lar@@ gest economy in the world been that of a develo@@ ping country , rather than a developed country ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , for the first time in the mo@@ der@@ n era , the dom@@ in@@ ant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the W@@ est and from very , very different civi@@ liz@@ a@@ tional ro@@ ots ."
"Now , I know it &apos;s a w@@ ide@@ spre@@ ad as@@ sum@@ ption in the W@@ est that as countries mo@@ der@@ n@@ ize , they also w@@ ester@@ n@@ ize ."
This is an il@@ lu@@ sion .
"It &apos;s an as@@ sum@@ ption that mo@@ der@@ n@@ ity is a produc@@ t simply of compe@@ ti@@ tion , marke@@ ts and technology ."
It is not . It is also shap@@ ed equ@@ ally by history and culture .
"@@ China is not like the W@@ est , and it will not become like the W@@ est ."
It will re@@ ma@@ in in very fun@@ da@@ mental re@@ spe@@ cts very different .
"Now the big question here is obvi@@ ously , how do we make sense of China ?"
How do we try to understand what China is ?
"And the problem we have in the W@@ est at the moment , by and large , is that the con@@ ven@@ tional appro@@ ach is that we understand it really in W@@ ester@@ n terms , using W@@ ester@@ n ideas ."
We can &apos;t .
"Now I want to of@@ fer you three building blo@@ cks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning ."
The first is this : that China is not really a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state .
"O@@ kay , it &apos;s called itself a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state for the last hundre@@ d years , but everyone who kno@@ ws anything about China kno@@ ws it &apos;s a lot ol@@ der than this ."
This was what China looked like with the v@@ ic@@ tory of the Q@@ in D@@ yn@@ as@@ ty in 2@@ 2@@ 1 B@@ .@@ C@@ . at the end of the war@@ rin@@ g@@ -@@ state peri@@ od — the bir@@ th of mo@@ der@@ n China .
And you can see it against the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies of mo@@ der@@ n China .
"O@@ r im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely af@@ ter@@ ward , the H@@ an D@@ yn@@ as@@ ty , still 2@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And you can see already it oc@@ cu@@ pi@@ es most of what we now know as E@@ as@@ ter@@ n China , which is where the vas@@ t maj@@ or@@ ity of Ch@@ in@@ ese li@@ ved then and live now ."
"Now what is extra@@ ordin@@ ary about this is , what gi@@ ves China its sense of being China , what gi@@ ves the Ch@@ in@@ ese the sense of what it is to be Ch@@ in@@ ese , comes not from the last hundre@@ d years , not from the na@@ tion@@ -@@ state peri@@ od , which is what happened in the W@@ est , but from the peri@@ od , if you like , of the civi@@ liz@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
"I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of cus@@ to@@ ms like an@@ ces@@ tra@@ l wor@@ ship , of a very dis@@ tin@@ ctive no@@ tion of the state , lik@@ e@@ w@@ ise , a very dis@@ tin@@ ctive no@@ tion of the family , social relation@@ shi@@ ps like gu@@ an@@ xi , Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an val@@ ues and so on ."
These are all things that come from the peri@@ od of the civi@@ liz@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state .
"In other words , China , un@@ like the W@@ ester@@ n sta@@ tes and most countries in the world , is shap@@ ed by its sense of civi@@ liz@@ ation , its exis@@ t@@ ence as a civi@@ liz@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state , rather than as a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
"And there &apos;s one other thing to ad@@ d to this , and that is this : O@@ f course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demo@@ grap@@ h@@ ically and ge@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ically , with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people ."
"What we often ar@@ en &apos;t really aw@@ are of is the fact that China is extre@@ me@@ ly di@@ verse and very pl@@ ur@@ alis@@ tic , and in many ways very de@@ cen@@ tr@@ al@@ ized ."
"You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , even though we think this to be the case ."
It &apos;s never been the case .
"So this is China , a civi@@ liz@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state , rather than a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think it has all sor@@ ts of pro@@ found im@@ plic@@ ations ."
I &apos;ll give you two quic@@ k ones .
"The first is that the most important political val@@ ue for the Ch@@ in@@ ese is un@@ ity , is the main@@ ten@@ ance of Ch@@ in@@ ese civi@@ liz@@ ation ."
"You know , 2@@ ,000 years ago , Euro@@ pe : bre@@ ak@@ down — the f@@ rag@@ men@@ tation of the H@@ o@@ ly R@@ o@@ man E@@ m@@ pi@@ re ."
"It divi@@ ded , and it &apos;s re@@ ma@@ ined divi@@ ded ever since ."
"@@ China , over the same time peri@@ od , went in exactly the op@@ pos@@ ite di@@ re@@ ction , very pain@@ fully h@@ ol@@ ding this huge civi@@ liz@@ ation , civi@@ liz@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state , together ."
"The second is maybe more pros@@ ai@@ c , which is H@@ on@@ g K@@ on@@ g ."
D@@ o you remember the h@@ an@@ do@@ ver of H@@ on@@ g K@@ on@@ g by B@@ rit@@ ain to China in 199@@ 7 ?
You may remember what the Ch@@ in@@ ese con@@ stitu@@ tional pro@@ posi@@ tion was .
"One country , two systems ."
And I &apos;ll la@@ y a w@@ ag@@ er that b@@ are@@ ly any@@ one in the W@@ est beli@@ ev@@ ed them .
&quot; &quot; W@@ in@@ do@@ w dre@@ ss@@ ing .
"When China gets its hands on H@@ on@@ g K@@ on@@ g , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ir@@ te@@ en years on , the political and leg@@ al system in H@@ on@@ g K@@ on@@ g is as different now as it was in 199@@ 7 ."
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
"We were wrong because we thought , na@@ tur@@ ally enough , in na@@ tion@@ -@@ state ways ."
"Th@@ in@@ k of Ger@@ man uni@@ fic@@ ation , 19@@ 90 ."
What happened ?
"Well , basically the E@@ ast was s@@ w@@ allo@@ wed by the W@@ est ."
"One n@@ ation , one system ."
That is the na@@ tion@@ -@@ state men@@ tal@@ ity .
"But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civi@@ liz@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state , on the bas@@ is of one civi@@ liz@@ ation , one system ."
It doesn &apos;t work .
"So actually the respon@@ se of China to the question of H@@ on@@ g K@@ on@@ g — as it will be to the question of T@@ ai@@ w@@ an — was a natural respon@@ se : one civi@@ liz@@ ation , many systems ."
Let me of@@ fer you another building blo@@ ck to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a com@@ for@@ table one .
"The Ch@@ in@@ ese have a very , very different con@@ cep@@ tion of ra@@ ce to most other countries ."
"D@@ o you know , of the 1@@ .@@ 3 billion Ch@@ in@@ ese , over 90 percent of them think they be@@ long to the same ra@@ ce , the H@@ an ?"
"Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most popu@@ l@@ ous countries ."
"In@@ dia , the United States , In@@ don@@ es@@ ia , Bra@@ zi@@ l — all of them are mul@@ ti@@ ra@@ cial ."
The Ch@@ in@@ ese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only mul@@ ti@@ ra@@ cial really at the mar@@ gin@@ s .
"So the question is , why ?"
"Well the reason , I think , es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally is , again , back to the civi@@ liz@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
"A history of at least 2@@ ,000 years , a history of con@@ qu@@ est , oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tion , ab@@ sor@@ ption , as@@ si@@ mil@@ ation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this no@@ tion of the H@@ an e@@ mer@@ ged — of course , n@@ ur@@ tu@@ red by a growing and very powerful sense of cul@@ tural identi@@ ty ."
"Now the great advan@@ ta@@ ge of this h@@ isto@@ ri@@ cal experience has been that , without the H@@ an , China could never have hel@@ d together ."
The H@@ an identi@@ ty has been the ce@@ ment which has hel@@ d this country together .
The great dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ge of it is that the H@@ an have a very we@@ ak con@@ cep@@ tion of cul@@ tural difference .
"They really believe in their own su@@ peri@@ or@@ ity , and they are dis@@ re@@ spe@@ c@@ t@@ ful of those who are not ."
"H@@ ence their at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , for example , to the U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur@@ s and to the T@@ i@@ be@@ tan@@ s ."
"O@@ r let me give you my third building blo@@ ck , the Ch@@ in@@ ese state ."
Now the relation@@ ship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the W@@ est .
Now we in the W@@ est over@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly see@@ m to think — in these days at least — that the au@@ thor@@ ity and le@@ gi@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy of the state is a fun@@ ction of democra@@ cy .
The problem with this pro@@ posi@@ tion is that the Ch@@ in@@ ese state en@@ j@@ oys more le@@ gi@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy and more au@@ thor@@ ity a@@ mon@@ g@@ st the Ch@@ in@@ ese than is true with any W@@ ester@@ n state .
"And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reas@@ ons , I think ."
"And it &apos;s obvi@@ ously got nothing to do with democra@@ cy , because in our terms the Ch@@ in@@ ese cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t have a democra@@ cy ."
"And the reason for this is , fir@@ st@@ ly , because the state in China is given a very speci@@ al — it en@@ j@@ oys a very speci@@ al sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance as the re@@ presen@@ ta@@ tive , the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment and the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an of Ch@@ in@@ ese civi@@ liz@@ ation , of the civi@@ liz@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
This is as close as China gets to a kind of spi@@ rit@@ ual ro@@ le .
"And the second reason is because , wh@@ ere@@ as in Euro@@ pe and Nor@@ th America , the state &apos;s power is contin@@ u@@ ously chall@@ eng@@ ed — I mean in the Euro@@ pe@@ an tradi@@ tion , h@@ isto@@ ri@@ cally against the ch@@ ur@@ ch , against other se@@ c@@ tors of the ar@@ isto@@ cra@@ cy , against mer@@ chan@@ ts and so on — for 1@@ ,000 years , the power of the Ch@@ in@@ ese state has not been chall@@ eng@@ ed ."
It &apos;s had no ser@@ i@@ ous ri@@ val@@ s .
So you can see that the way in which power has been con@@ struc@@ ted in China is very different from our experience in W@@ ester@@ n history .
"The resul@@ t , by the way , is that the Ch@@ in@@ ese have a very different view of the state ."
"Wh@@ ere@@ as we ten@@ d to view it as an in@@ tru@@ der , a str@@ ang@@ er , cer@@ tain@@ ly an or@@ g@@ an wh@@ ose po@@ wers need to be li@@ mi@@ ted or defin@@ ed and con@@ stra@@ ined , the Ch@@ in@@ ese don &apos;t see the state like that at all ."
"The Ch@@ in@@ ese view the state as an in@@ ti@@ mate — not just as an in@@ ti@@ mate actually , as a mem@@ ber of the family — not just in fact as a mem@@ ber of the family , but as the head of the family , the pa@@ tri@@ arch of the family ."
"This is the Ch@@ in@@ ese view of the state — very , very different to ours ."
It &apos;s em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the W@@ est .
"And I would sug@@ gest to you that actually what we are de@@ al@@ ing with here , in the Ch@@ in@@ ese con@@ text , is a new kind of para@@ dig@@ m , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past ."
K@@ now that China beli@@ ev@@ es in the market and the state .
"I mean , A@@ da@@ m S@@ mit@@ h , already wri@@ ting in the late 18@@ th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Ch@@ in@@ ese market is lar@@ ger and more developed and more so@@ ph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated than anything in Euro@@ pe . &quot; &quot; And , ap@@ art from the M@@ ao peri@@ od , that has re@@ ma@@ ined more or less the case ever since ."
But this is com@@ b@@ ined with an extre@@ me@@ ly st@@ rong and u@@ bi@@ qui@@ to@@ us state .
The state is every@@ where in China .
"I mean , it &apos;s lead@@ ing fir@@ ms — many of them are still pub@@ li@@ c@@ ly ow@@ ned ."
"P@@ riv@@ ate fir@@ ms , ho@@ w@@ ever large they are , like L@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ o , depen@@ d in many ways on state pa@@ tron@@ age ."
T@@ ar@@ gets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
"And the state , of course , its au@@ thor@@ ity flo@@ ws into lots of other are@@ as — as we are fami@@ li@@ ar with — with something like the on@@ e-@@ child poli@@ cy ."
"M@@ or@@ e@@ over , this is a very old state tradi@@ tion , a very old tradi@@ tion of sta@@ te@@ cra@@ ft ."
"I mean , if you want an ill@@ us@@ tra@@ tion of this , the Gre@@ at W@@ all is one ."
"But this is another , this is the G@@ r@@ and C@@ an@@ al , which was con@@ struc@@ ted in the first in@@ stan@@ ce in the fi@@ f@@ th century B@@ .@@ C@@ ."
and was finally comple@@ ted in the se@@ ven@@ th century A@@ .@@ D@@ .
"It went for 1@@ ,@@ 1@@ 1@@ 4 mil@@ es , lin@@ king B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing with H@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou and S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai ."
"So there &apos;s a long history of extra@@ ordin@@ ary state in@@ fras@@ tr@@ uc@@ tural pro@@ jects in China , which I sup@@ pose hel@@ ps us to expl@@ ain what we see today , which is something like the Th@@ ree G@@ or@@ ges D@@ am and many other ex@@ pres@@ sions of state compe@@ t@@ ence within China ."
"So there we have three building blo@@ cks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civi@@ liz@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state , the no@@ tion of ra@@ ce and the nature of the state and its relation@@ ship to society ."
"And yet we still in@@ sis@@ t , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply dra@@ wing on W@@ ester@@ n experience , looking at it through W@@ ester@@ n eyes , using W@@ ester@@ n con@@ cep@@ ts ."
If you want to know why we un@@ er@@ rin@@ g@@ ly see@@ m to get China wrong — our pre@@ dic@@ tions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are in@@ cor@@ re@@ ct — this is the reason .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ na@@ tely , I think , I have to say that I think at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de to@@ wards China is that of a kind of little W@@ ester@@ ner men@@ tal@@ ity ."
It &apos;s kind of ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant .
"It &apos;s ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant in the sense that we think that we are best , and ther@@ e@@ fore we have the uni@@ vers@@ al measu@@ re ."
"And secon@@ dly , it &apos;s ig@@ nor@@ ant ."
We re@@ fu@@ se to really ad@@ dre@@ ss the issu@@ e of difference .
"You know , there &apos;s a very interesting pas@@ s@@ age in a book by P@@ au@@ l C@@ o@@ h@@ en , the American h@@ isto@@ ri@@ an ."
And P@@ au@@ l C@@ o@@ h@@ en argu@@ es that the W@@ est thin@@ ks of itself as probably the most cos@@ mo@@ pol@@ itan of all cul@@ tures .
But it &apos;s not .
"In many ways , it &apos;s the most paro@@ chi@@ al , because for 200 years , the W@@ est has been so dom@@ in@@ ant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cul@@ tures , other civi@@ liz@@ ations ."
"Because , at the end of the day , it could , if ne@@ cess@@ ary by for@@ ce , get its own way ."
"Wh@@ ere@@ as those cul@@ tures — vir@@ tually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far we@@ ak@@ er posi@@ tion , vis@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ v@@ is the W@@ est — have been ther@@ e@@ by for@@ ced to understand the W@@ est , because of the W@@ est &apos;s pres@@ ence in those socie@@ ties ."
"And ther@@ e@@ fore , they are , as a resul@@ t , more cos@@ mo@@ pol@@ itan in many ways than the W@@ est ."
"I mean , take the question of E@@ ast A@@ sia ."
"E@@ ast A@@ sia : J@@ ap@@ an , Kor@@ ea , China , e@@ t@@ c . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there ."
Now the lar@@ gest economic re@@ gion in the world .
"And I &apos;ll tell you now , that E@@ ast A@@ si@@ an@@ ers , people from E@@ ast A@@ sia , are far more knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able about the W@@ est than the W@@ est is about E@@ ast A@@ sia ."
"Now this point is very ger@@ man@@ e , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id , to the present ."
"Because what &apos;s happening ? B@@ ack to that char@@ t at the beginning , the G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s char@@ t ."
"What is happening is that , very rap@@ id@@ ly in h@@ isto@@ ri@@ cal terms , the world is being d@@ riv@@ en and shap@@ ed , not by the old developed countries , but by the develo@@ ping world ."
"We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G@@ 20 u@@ sur@@ ping very rap@@ id@@ ly the posi@@ tion of the G@@ 7 , or the G@@ 8 ."
And there are two con@@ sequ@@ ences of this .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the W@@ est is rap@@ id@@ ly lo@@ sing its in@@ flu@@ ence in the world ."
"There was a dra@@ mati@@ c ill@@ us@@ tra@@ tion of this actually a year ago — C@@ open@@ h@@ ag@@ en , cli@@ mate change con@@ fer@@ ence ."
Euro@@ pe was not at the fin@@ al ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating table .
Wh@@ en did that last happen ?
I would w@@ ag@@ er it was probably about 200 years ago .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
"And the second im@@ plic@@ ation is that the world will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably , as a con@@ sequ@@ ence , become incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly un@@ fami@@ li@@ ar to us , because it &apos;ll be shap@@ ed by cul@@ tures and experi@@ ences and h@@ istories that we are not really fami@@ li@@ ar with , or con@@ vers@@ ant with ."
"And at last , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id — take Euro@@ pe ; America is sli@@ gh@@ tly different — but Euro@@ pe@@ ans by and large , I have to say , are ig@@ nor@@ ant , are una@@ w@@ are about the way the world is chan@@ ging ."
"S@@ ome people — I &apos;ve got an Eng@@ lish friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The contin@@ ent is s@@ le@@ ep@@ wal@@ king into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation ."
But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Euro@@ pe is incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly out of to@@ uch with the world — and that is a sort of lo@@ ss of a sense of the future .
"I mean , Euro@@ pe once , of course , once com@@ man@@ ded the future in its con@@ fi@@ dence ."
"T@@ ake the 19@@ th century , for example ."
"But this , al@@ as , is no longer true ."
"If you want to feel the future , if you want to tas@@ te the future , try China — there &apos;s old Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us ."
This is a ra@@ il@@ way sta@@ tion the lik@@ es of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a ra@@ il@@ way sta@@ tion .
This is the new &#91; W@@ u@@ h@@ an &#93; ra@@ il@@ way sta@@ tion for the high@@ -@@ spe@@ ed tra@@ ins .
China already has a big@@ ger net@@ work than any other country in the world and will so@@ on have more than all the rest of the world put together .
"O@@ r take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out shor@@ tly in a su@@ bur@@ b of B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing ."
"@@ Here you have a me@@ g@@ ab@@ us , on the up@@ per de@@ ck car@@ ries about 2@@ ,000 people ."
"It tra@@ vel@@ s on ra@@ il@@ s down a su@@ bur@@ ban ro@@ ad , and the cars tra@@ vel under@@ ne@@ ath it ."
And it does spe@@ e@@ ds of up to about 100 mil@@ es an h@@ our .
"Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very speci@@ fic problem , which is different from Euro@@ pe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space ."
"So this is a solution to a sit@@ u@@ ation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people ."
"O@@ kay , so how would I like to fin@@ ish ?"
"Well , what should our at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de be to@@ wards this world that we see very rap@@ id@@ ly develo@@ ping before us ?"
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
"But I want to argu@@ e , ab@@ o@@ ve all , a big@@ -@@ picture posi@@ tive for this world ."
"For 200 years , the world was es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally go@@ ver@@ ned by a f@@ rag@@ ment of the human population ."
That &apos;s what Euro@@ pe and Nor@@ th America re@@ presen@@ ted .
"The ar@@ riv@@ al of countries like China and India — between them 3@@ 8 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like In@@ don@@ es@@ ia and Bra@@ zi@@ l and so on , re@@ present the most important single act of democra@@ tiz@@ ation in the last 200 years ."
"C@@ i@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and cul@@ tures , which had been ig@@ nor@@ ed , which had no voice , which were not lis@@ ten@@ ed to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of re@@ presen@@ tation in this world ."
"As human@@ is@@ ts , we must wel@@ come , su@@ re@@ ly , this trans@@ formation , and we will have to learn about these civi@@ liz@@ ations ."
"This big ship here was the one s@@ ai@@ led in by Z@@ h@@ en@@ g He in the early 1@@ 5@@ th century on his great voy@@ ages around the S@@ outh China S@@ ea , the E@@ ast China S@@ ea and across the In@@ di@@ an O@@ c@@ ean to E@@ ast Africa ."
"The little bo@@ at in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Chris@@ to@@ ph@@ er C@@ ol@@ um@@ b@@ us cro@@ s@@ sed the A@@ t@@ l@@ anti@@ c ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ r , look care@@ fully at this sil@@ k s@@ cro@@ ll made by Z@@ hu@@ Z@@ h@@ ou in 1@@ 3@@ 6@@ 8 ."
I think they &apos;re pla@@ ying g@@ ol@@ f .

W@@ el@@ come to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to start a re@@ vol@@ ution .
"Now before you get up in ar@@ ms , or you bre@@ ak into son@@ g , or you pi@@ ck a fav@@ or@@ ite co@@ lor , I want to defin@@ e what I mean by re@@ vol@@ ution ."
"B@@ y re@@ vol@@ ution , I mean a dras@@ tic and far@@ -@@ re@@ ach@@ ing change in the way we think and be@@ have — the way we think and the way we be@@ have ."
"Now why , S@@ te@@ ve , why do we need a re@@ vol@@ ution ?"
We need a re@@ vol@@ ution because things ar@@ en &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
And that makes me really s@@ ad because I &apos;m si@@ ck and ti@@ red of things not working .
"You know , I &apos;m si@@ ck and ti@@ red of us not living up to our poten@@ tial ."
I &apos;m si@@ ck and ti@@ red of us being last .
"And we are last place in so many things — for example , social fac@@ tors ."
We &apos;re last place in Euro@@ pe in innov@@ ation .
"There we are right at the end , right at the bot@@ to@@ m , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t val@@ ue innov@@ ation ."
"We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of wel@@ l@@ -@@ being ."
"And there we are , not just last in the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , we &apos;re last in Euro@@ pe , at the very bot@@ to@@ m ."
"And wor@@ st of all , it just came out three we@@ eks ago , many of you have seen it , The E@@ con@@ om@@ ist ."
"We &apos;re the s@@ ad@@ de@@ st place on Earth , rela@@ tive to G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ ita — the s@@ ad@@ de@@ st place on Earth ."
That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
Wh@@ ere do we ran@@ k three we@@ eks ago in another re@@ port by the O@@ E@@ C@@ D ?
"L@@ ast in read@@ ing , ma@@ th and science . L@@ ast ."

that en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ s provi@@ de ben@@ ef@@ its to society .
"Wh@@ y as a resul@@ t , what happens ?"
The lo@@ w@@ est per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r@@ s star@@ ting busin@@ es@@ ses .
And this is de@@ sp@@ ite the fact that everybody kno@@ ws that small business is the en@@ gine of econom@@ ies .

"So if our en@@ gine &apos;s bro@@ k@@ en , gu@@ ess what ?"
L@@ ast in Euro@@ pe G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ ita .
L@@ ast .
"So it &apos;s no surpris@@ e , guys , that 6@@ 2 percent of B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ ans are not op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic about the future ."
"We &apos;re un@@ happy , we have bad education , and we have the wor@@ st busin@@ es@@ ses ."
"And these are fac@@ ts , guys ."
This isn &apos;t story tal@@ e ; it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy I have got against B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria . These are fac@@ ts .
"So I think it should be really , really cle@@ ar that our system is bro@@ k@@ en ."
"The way we think , the way we be@@ have , our oper@@ ating system of be@@ having is bro@@ k@@ en ."
"We need a dras@@ tic change in the way we think and be@@ have to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future ."
How did this happen ?
Let &apos;s be posi@@ tive now . We &apos;re going to get posi@@ tive . How did this happen ?
I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be dras@@ tic to some of you — because we are h@@ an@@ di@@ cap@@ ping ourselves .
We &apos;re h@@ ol@@ ding ourselves back because we don &apos;t val@@ ue play .
"I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right ."
"In case some of you for@@ got what play is , this is what play looks like ."
"B@@ ab@@ ies play , kids play , ad@@ ul@@ ts play ."
We don &apos;t val@@ ue play .
"In fact , we de@@ val@@ ue play ."
And we de@@ val@@ ue it in three are@@ as .
Let &apos;s go back to the same three are@@ as .
So@@ cial : 4@@ 5 years of what ?
"O@@ f commun@@ ism — of val@@ u@@ ing the society and the state over the individu@@ al and squ@@ as@@ hing , in@@ ad@@ ver@@ ten@@ tly , crea@@ tivity , individu@@ al self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion and innov@@ ation ."
"And instead , what do we val@@ ue ?"
"Because it &apos;s sho@@ wn the way we ap@@ ply , gener@@ ate and use knowledge is af@@ fe@@ cted by our social and institu@@ tional con@@ text , which told us what in commun@@ ism ?"
To be ser@@ i@@ ous .
"To be really , really ser@@ i@@ ous ."
It did .
( Applause ) B@@ e ser@@ i@@ ous .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been s@@ col@@ ded in the par@@ k for le@@ tting my kids play on the ground .
"H@@ e@@ av@@ en for@@ bi@@ d they play in the di@@ r@@ t , the ka@@ l , or even wor@@ se , lo@@ k@@ v@@ i , water — that will k@@ ill them ."
I have been told by bab@@ as and dy@@ ad@@ os that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is ser@@ i@@ ous and we need to tra@@ in them for the ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness of life .
We have a ser@@ i@@ ous me@@ me run@@ ning through .
It &apos;s a social gen@@ e run@@ ning through us .
It &apos;s a ser@@ i@@ ous gen@@ e .
It &apos;s 4@@ 5 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; bab@@ a fac@@ tor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
"S@@ te@@ p one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a bab@@ y . Is@@ ka@@ m bab@@ y . &quot; &quot; S@@ te@@ p two : we get the bab@@ y . W@@ o@@ o@@ ho@@ o !"
But then what happens in step three ?
I want to go back to work because I need to fu@@ r@@ ther my care@@ er or I just want to go have co@@ f@@ fe@@ es .
I &apos;m going to give be@@ b@@ ko to bab@@ a .
But we need to remember that bab@@ a &apos;s been in@@ fe@@ cted by the ser@@ i@@ ous me@@ me for 4@@ 5 years .
So what happens ?
"She pas@@ ses that vir@@ us on to bab@@ y , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the re@@ d@@ wo@@ od tre@@ es — for that ser@@ i@@ ous me@@ me to get out of our oper@@ ating system ."
What happens then ?
"It goes into education where we have an anti@@ qu@@ ated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that val@@ ues ro@@ te learning , memor@@ ization and stan@@ dar@@ di@@ z@@ ation , and de@@ val@@ ues self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , self-@@ expl@@ or@@ ation , ques@@ tion@@ ing , crea@@ tivity and play ."
It &apos;s a cra@@ p system .
T@@ ru@@ e story : I went looking for a school for my ki@@ d .
We went to this pre@@ sti@@ gi@@ ous little school and they say they &apos;re going to study ma@@ th 10 times a week and science eight times a week and read@@ ing five times a day and all this stuff .
"And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and re@@ cess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ a . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the sche@@ du@@ le . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a cri@@ me . What a cri@@ me ."
"And it &apos;s a cri@@ me that our education system is so ser@@ i@@ ous because education is ser@@ i@@ ous that we &apos;re cre@@ ating min@@ d@@ less , robo@@ tic wor@@ k@@ ers to put b@@ ol@@ ts in pre@@ -@@ dri@@ l@@ led h@@ oles ."
"But I &apos;m sor@@ ry , the problems of today are not the problems of the In@@ dus@@ tri@@ al R@@ evol@@ ution ."
"We need ad@@ ap@@ ta@@ bility , the ability to learn how to be crea@@ tive and inno@@ va@@ tive ."
We don &apos;t need me@@ chan@@ ized wor@@ k@@ ers .
"But no , now our me@@ me goes into work where we don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"We create robo@@ tic wor@@ k@@ ers that we tre@@ at like as@@ se@@ ts , to le@@ ver and just thro@@ w away ."
What are qu@@ ali@@ ties of a B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ an work ?
Au@@ to@@ cra@@ tic — do what I say because I &apos;m the che@@ f .
I &apos;m the b@@ os@@ s and I know better than you .
"U@@ n@@ tr@@ us@@ ting — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously a cri@@ min@@ al , so I &apos;m going to in@@ st@@ all ca@@ mer@@ as ."
"( Laughter ) Con@@ tro@@ l@@ ling — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously an idi@@ ot , so I &apos;m going to make a z@@ il@@ lion little pro@@ ces@@ ses for you to fol@@ low so you don &apos;t step out of the box ."
"So they &apos;re re@@ stri@@ ctive — don &apos;t use your mo@@ bil@@ e phone , don &apos;t use your lap@@ top , don &apos;t se@@ arch the Internet , don &apos;t be on I@@ .@@ M@@ ."
That &apos;s some@@ how un@@ pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ al and bad .
"And at the end of the day , it &apos;s un@@ ful@@ fil@@ ling because you &apos;re contro@@ l@@ led , you &apos;re re@@ stri@@ cted , you &apos;re not val@@ u@@ ed and you &apos;re not having any fu@@ n ."
"In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , S@@ te@@ ve . What a du@@ m@@ b idea ."
It can &apos;t be because of play .
"@@ Just play , that &apos;s a stu@@ pi@@ d thing . &quot; &quot; We have the ser@@ i@@ ous me@@ me in us ."
Well I &apos;m going to say no .
"And I will pro@@ ve it to you in the next part of the spe@@ e@@ ch — that play is the ca@@ tal@@ y@@ st , it is the re@@ vol@@ ution , that we can use to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria for the better ."
P@@ la@@ y : our bra@@ ins are har@@ d@@ wi@@ red for play .
"E@@ vol@@ ution has se@@ le@@ cted , over mil@@ lions and bil@@ lions of years , for play in animals and in humans ."
And you know what ?
"E@@ vol@@ ution does a really , really good job of de@@ se@@ le@@ cting tra@@ its that ar@@ en &apos;t advan@@ ta@@ ge@@ ous to us and se@@ le@@ cting tra@@ its for compe@@ ti@@ tive advan@@ ta@@ ge ."
"N@@ a@@ ture isn &apos;t stu@@ pi@@ d , and it se@@ le@@ cted for play ."
"Th@@ ro@@ ugh@@ out the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , for example : an@@ ts . An@@ ts play ."
M@@ ay@@ be you didn &apos;t know that .
"But when they &apos;re pla@@ ying , they &apos;re learning the social order and dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs of things ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ ts play , but what you might not have known is that ra@@ ts that play more have big@@ ger bra@@ ins and they learn tas@@ ks better , sk@@ il@@ ls ."
K@@ it@@ ten@@ s play . We all know k@@ it@@ ten@@ s play .
But what you may not know is that k@@ it@@ ten@@ s de@@ p@@ riv@@ ed of play are un@@ able to inter@@ act soci@@ ally .
"They can still hun@@ t , but they can &apos;t be social ."
B@@ ear@@ s play .
But what you may not know is that be@@ ars that play more sur@@ vi@@ ve longer .
It &apos;s not the be@@ ars that learn how to fish better .
It &apos;s the ones that play more .
"And a fin@@ al really interesting study — it &apos;s been sho@@ wn , a cor@@ rela@@ tion between play and brain size ."
"The more you play , the big@@ ger the bra@@ ins there are ."
"D@@ ol@@ ph@@ ins , pretty big bra@@ ins , play a lot ."
But who do you think with the big@@ gest bra@@ ins are the big@@ gest play@@ ers ?
Y@@ ours tru@@ ly : humans .
"K@@ i@@ ds play , we play — of every na@@ tion@@ ality , of every ra@@ ce , of every co@@ lor , of every reli@@ gion ."
It &apos;s a uni@@ vers@@ al thing — we play .
"And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s ad@@ ul@@ ts too ."
Re@@ ally co@@ ol ter@@ m : ne@@ ot@@ en@@ y — the re@@ ten@@ tion of play and ju@@ ven@@ ile tra@@ its in ad@@ ul@@ ts .
And who are the big@@ gest ne@@ ot@@ en@@ is@@ ts ?
H@@ u@@ man@@ s . We play s@@ por@@ ts .
"We do it for fu@@ n , or as O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ ans , or as pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ als ."
We play mu@@ si@@ cal in@@ str@@ u@@ ments .
"We d@@ ance , we k@@ is@@ s , we sing , we just go@@ of around ."
We &apos;re desig@@ ned by nature to play from bir@@ th to old age .
We &apos;re desig@@ ned to do that contin@@ u@@ ously — to play and play a lot and not stop pla@@ ying .
It is a huge ben@@ ef@@ it .
"@@ Just like there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its to animals , there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its to humans ."
"For example , it &apos;s been sho@@ wn to sti@@ mu@@ late neu@@ ral growth in the am@@ yg@@ d@@ al@@ a , in the area where it contro@@ ls emo@@ tions ."
It &apos;s been sho@@ wn to pro@@ m@@ ote pre@@ -@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x develo@@ pment where a lot of co@@ g@@ ni@@ tion is happening .
"As a resul@@ t , what happens ?"
We develo@@ p more emo@@ tional ma@@ tur@@ ity if we play more .
We develo@@ p better decis@@ ion@@ -@@ making ability if we play more .
These guys are fac@@ ts .
"It &apos;s not fic@@ tion , it &apos;s not story tal@@ es , it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe ; it &apos;s col@@ d , hard science ."
These are the ben@@ ef@@ its to play .
"It is a gene@@ tic bir@@ th@@ right that we have , like wal@@ king or spe@@ aking or seeing ."
"And if we h@@ an@@ dic@@ ap ourselves with play , we h@@ an@@ dic@@ ap ourselves as if we would with any other bir@@ th@@ right that we have ."
We hold ourselves back .
L@@ it@@ tle ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
"I@@ ma@@ gine a world without the@@ ater , without the ar@@ ts , without son@@ g , without dan@@ cing , without so@@ c@@ cer , without fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all , without l@@ aughter ."
What does this world look like ?
It &apos;s pretty b@@ le@@ ak .
It &apos;s pretty g@@ lu@@ m .
Now imagine your wor@@ k@@ place .
I@@ s it fu@@ n ? I@@ s it play@@ ful ?
O@@ r maybe the wor@@ k@@ place of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
I@@ s it fu@@ n ? I@@ s it play@@ ful ?
"O@@ r is it cra@@ p ? I@@ s it auto@@ cra@@ tic , contro@@ l@@ ling , re@@ stri@@ ctive and un@@ tr@@ us@@ ting and un@@ ful@@ fil@@ ling ?"
We have this con@@ cept that the op@@ pos@@ ite of play is work .
We even feel gu@@ il@@ ty if we &apos;re seen pla@@ ying at work .
"&quot; Oh , my colle@@ ag@@ ues see me l@@ augh@@ ing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hi@@ de because my b@@ os@@ s might see me ."
He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is bac@@ k@@ wards .
The op@@ pos@@ ite of play is not work . The op@@ pos@@ ite of play
is de@@ pres@@ sion . It &apos;s de@@ pres@@ sion .
"In fact , play impro@@ ves our work ."
"@@ Just like there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its for humans and animals , there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its for play at work ."
"For example , it sti@@ mu@@ la@@ tes crea@@ tivity ."
It incre@@ as@@ es our open@@ ness to change .
It impro@@ ves our ability to learn .
"It provi@@ des a sense of pur@@ pose and mas@@ ter@@ y — two key motiv@@ a@@ tional things that incre@@ ase produc@@ tivity , through play ."
"So before you start thinking of play as just not ser@@ i@@ ous , play doesn &apos;t mean f@@ riv@@ ol@@ ous ."
"You know , the pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ al ath@@ le@@ te that lo@@ ves sk@@ i@@ ing , he &apos;s ser@@ i@@ ous about it , but he lo@@ ves it ."
"He &apos;s having fu@@ n , he &apos;s in the gro@@ o@@ ve , he &apos;s in the f@@ low ."
"A doc@@ tor might be ser@@ i@@ ous , but l@@ aughter &apos;s still a great me@@ dic@@ ine ."
O@@ ur thinking is bac@@ k@@ wards .
We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be feel@@ ing gu@@ il@@ ty .
We should be c@@ ele@@ bra@@ ting play .
Q@@ u@@ ic@@ k example from the cor@@ po@@ rate world .
"F@@ ed@@ E@@ x , easy m@@ ot@@ to : people , serv@@ ice , pro@@ f@@ it ."
"If you tre@@ at your people like people , if you tre@@ at them great , they &apos;re hap@@ pi@@ er , they &apos;re ful@@ fil@@ led , they have a sense of mas@@ ter@@ y and pur@@ pose ."
"What happens ? They give better serv@@ ice — not wor@@ se , but better ."
"And when cus@@ to@@ mers call for serv@@ ice and they &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with happy people that can make decis@@ i@@ ons and are ful@@ fil@@ led , how do the cus@@ to@@ mers feel ? They feel great ."
"And what do great cus@@ to@@ mers do , gre@@ at@@ -@@ feel@@ ing cus@@ to@@ mers ?"
"They bu@@ y more of your serv@@ ice and they tell more of their friends , which lead@@ s to more pro@@ f@@ it ."
"P@@ e@@ ople , serv@@ ice , pro@@ f@@ it ."
"P@@ la@@ y incre@@ as@@ es produc@@ tivity , not de@@ cre@@ as@@ es ."
"And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; G@@ e@@ e , that can work for F@@ ed@@ E@@ x out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria ."
"N@@ o way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria , you guys . T@@ w@@ o reas@@ ons ."
"One , play is uni@@ vers@@ al ."
"There &apos;s nothing w@@ ei@@ r@@ d about B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ ans that we can &apos;t play , be@@ si@@ des the ser@@ i@@ ous me@@ me that we have to k@@ ic@@ k out ."
"T@@ w@@ o , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at S@@ ci@@ ant ."
"When I got there , we had z@@ ero happy cus@@ to@@ mers ."
N@@ ot one cus@@ to@@ mer would re@@ fer us .
I asked them all .
We had mar@@ gin@@ al pro@@ f@@ it — I did .
"We had mar@@ gin@@ al pro@@ f@@ its , and we had un@@ happy sta@@ ke@@ h@@ ol@@ ders ."
"Th@@ ro@@ ugh some bas@@ ic change , change like impro@@ ving trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy , change like pro@@ mo@@ ting self-@@ di@@ re@@ ction and col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation , en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ing col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation , not auto@@ cra@@ cy , the things like having a resul@@ ts@@ -@@ focu@@ s ."
I don &apos;t care when you get in in the mor@@ ning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
I care that your cus@@ to@@ mer and your team is happy and you &apos;re organ@@ ized with that .
Why do I care if you get in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck ?
B@@ as@@ ically pro@@ mo@@ ting fu@@ n .
"Th@@ ro@@ ugh pro@@ mo@@ ting fu@@ n and a great environment , we were able to trans@@ form S@@ ci@@ ant and , in just three shor@@ t years — soun@@ ds like a long time , but change is s@@ low — every cus@@ to@@ mer , from z@@ ero to every cus@@ to@@ mer re@@ fer@@ ring us , ab@@ o@@ ve a@@ verage pro@@ f@@ its for the indus@@ try and happy sta@@ ke@@ h@@ ol@@ ders ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did w@@ in , every year that we en@@ ter@@ ed , one of the ran@@ kin@@ gs for best em@@ ploy@@ er for small business ."
In@@ depen@@ dent analy@@ sis from an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous em@@ ploy@@ e@@ es on their sur@@ ve@@ ys .
"It does , and it can , work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria ."
"There &apos;s nothing h@@ ol@@ ding us back , ex@@ cept our own men@@ tal@@ ity about play ."
So some ste@@ ps that we can take — to fin@@ ish up — how to make this re@@ vol@@ ution through play .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , you have to believe me ."
"If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something ."
"S@@ econ@@ d of all , if you don &apos;t have the feel@@ ing of play in you , you need to re@@ disco@@ ver play ."
"W@@ ha@@ te@@ ver it was that as a ki@@ d you used to en@@ j@@ oy , that you en@@ j@@ oy@@ ed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that pro@@ mo@@ tion you can &apos;t en@@ j@@ oy , because you feel like you have to be ser@@ i@@ ous , re@@ disco@@ ver it ."
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s m@@ oun@@ tain b@@ ik@@ ing or read@@ ing a book or pla@@ ying a game .
"@@ Re@@ disco@@ ver that because you &apos;re the lead@@ ers , the innov@@ ation lead@@ ers , the thought lead@@ ers ."
You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the off@@ ice or talk to your friends and ig@@ n@@ ite the fi@@ re of change in the play re@@ vol@@ ution .
"You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feel@@ ing it , your colle@@ ag@@ ues , your em@@ ploy@@ e@@ es , ar@@ en &apos;t going to feel it ."
"You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m going to tr@@ ust you . &quot; &quot; W@@ ei@@ r@@ d con@@ cept : I hi@@ red you ; I should tr@@ ust you ."
"I &apos;m going to let you make decis@@ i@@ ons . I &apos;m going to em@@ power you , and I &apos;m going to de@@ leg@@ ate to the lo@@ w@@ est level , rather than the top ."
I &apos;m going to en@@ cou@@ rag@@ e con@@ struc@@ tive cri@@ tic@@ ism .
I &apos;m going to let you challenge au@@ thor@@ ity .
Because it &apos;s by chall@@ eng@@ ing the way things are always done is that we are able to bre@@ ak out of the r@@ ut that we &apos;re in and create inno@@ va@@ tive solu@@ tions to problems of today .
We &apos;re not always right as lead@@ ers .
We &apos;re going to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate fe@@ ar .
F@@ e@@ ar is the en@@ e@@ my of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like eli@@ min@@ ate re@@ stri@@ ctions .
"You know what , let them use their mo@@ bil@@ e phone for person@@ al c@@ alls — he@@ av@@ en for@@ bi@@ d ."
Let them be on the Internet .
Let them be on in@@ st@@ ant me@@ s@@ sen@@ g@@ ers .
Let them take long l@@ un@@ ches .
L@@ un@@ ch is like the re@@ cess for work .
"It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you re@@ char@@ ge your brain , you me@@ et your friends , you have a be@@ er , you have some food , you talk , you get some syn@@ erg@@ y of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before ."
"L@@ et them do it . Gi@@ ve them some fre@@ e@@ dom , and in gener@@ al , let them play . Let them have fu@@ n at the wor@@ k@@ place ."
"We spend so much of our lives at the wor@@ k@@ place , and it &apos;s sup@@ posed to be , what , a mis@@ er@@ able g@@ rin@@ d , so that 20 years from now , we w@@ ake up and say , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this it ?"
I@@ s that all there was ? &quot; &quot; U@@ n@@ ac@@ cep@@ table . N@@ ep@@ ri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
"( Laughter ) So in sum@@ mar@@ y , we need a dras@@ tic change in the way we think and be@@ have , but we don &apos;t need a wor@@ k@@ ers &apos; re@@ vol@@ ution ."
We don &apos;t need a wor@@ k@@ ers &apos; re@@ vol@@ ution .
What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; up@@ ris@@ ing . What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; up@@ ris@@ ing . What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; up@@ ris@@ ing .
"S@@ eri@@ ously , we need to b@@ and together . T@@ o@@ day is the start of the up@@ ris@@ ing . But what you need to do is f@@ an the f@@ la@@ mes of the re@@ vol@@ ution . You need to go and share your ideas and your suc@@ cess sto@@ ri@@ es@@ "
"@@ of what worked about re@@ in@@ vi@@ gor@@ ating our lives , our scho@@ ols , and our work with play ; about how play pro@@ m@@ otes a sense of pro@@ mis@@ e and self-@@ ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment ; of how play pro@@ m@@ otes innov@@ ation and produc@@ tivity , and , ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely , how play cre@@ ates me@@ an@@ ing ."
"Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria for the better ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by of@@ fer@@ ing you a free no@@ -@@ te@@ ch life h@@ ack , and all it re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ di@@ t of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making y@@ ourselves sm@@ al@@ ler ?
S@@ ome@@ times we hold on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we spre@@ ad out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to p@@ ay atten@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re particu@@ lar@@ ly interested in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a s@@ mil@@ e , or a con@@ tem@@ p@@ tu@@ ous g@@ lan@@ ce , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a h@@ and@@ sh@@ ake ."
N@@ ar@@ ra@@ tor : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New York T@@ imes .
"So obvi@@ ously when we think about non@@ ver@@ bal behavior , or body language — but we call it non@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communic@@ ation ."
"When we think about communic@@ ation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
"And those ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments can pre@@ di@@ ct really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we hi@@ re or pro@@ m@@ ote , who we ask out on a d@@ ate ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ ini A@@ m@@ b@@ ad@@ y , a rese@@ arch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts Uni@@ versity , sho@@ ws that when people wat@@ ch 3@@ 0@@ -@@ second soun@@ d@@ less cli@@ ps of real physi@@ ci@@ an@@ -@@ pati@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the physi@@ ci@@ an &apos;s n@@ ic@@ en@@ ess pre@@ di@@ ct whether or not that physi@@ ci@@ an will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . Right ?"
"We are also in@@ flu@@ en@@ ced by our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ ghts and our feel@@ ings and our physi@@ o@@ logy ."
So what non@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psy@@ cho@@ logis@@ t . I study pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , and I te@@ ach at a compe@@ ti@@ tive business school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interested in power dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs ."
I became es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally interested in non@@ ver@@ bal ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance .
And what are non@@ ver@@ bal ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance ?
"So in the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , they are about ex@@ pan@@ ding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically open@@ ing up ."
It &apos;s about open@@ ing up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ es@@ si@@ ca T@@ ra@@ cy has stu@@ died ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really powerful with us , we ten@@ d to make ourselves sm@@ al@@ ler . We don &apos;t mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavior in the clas@@ s@@ room , and what do I no@@ tice ?"
"When they si@@ t down , they &apos;re sort of spre@@ ad out ."
"You have other people who are vir@@ tually col@@ lap@@ sing when they come in . As so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I no@@ tice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more lik@@ ely to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ o@@ men feel chron@@ ically less powerful than men , so this is not surpris@@ ing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A clas@@ s@@ room , because parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So business scho@@ ols have been str@@ ug@@ g@@ ling with this gen@@ der gra@@ de g@@ ap .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ting ."
There &apos;s some evi@@ dence that they do .
"So , for example , we s@@ mil@@ e when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ ced to s@@ mil@@ e by h@@ ol@@ ding a pen in our te@@ e@@ th like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ dies , but is it also true that our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the powerful ver@@ su@@ s the power@@ less look like ?
"So powerful people ten@@ d to be , not surpris@@ ing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ dent , more op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to w@@ in even at g@@ ames of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ris@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to stre@@ ss ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power le@@ a@@ der that &apos;s dom@@ in@@ ant , high on te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but really stre@@ ss re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"Pro@@ b@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this evi@@ dence , both that the body can shap@@ e the mind , at least at the fac@@ i@@ al level , and also that ro@@ le changes can shap@@ e the mind ."
"So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ ima@@ l level , like this tin@@ y man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation , this tin@@ y inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the lo@@ w@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re to@@ uch@@ ing your ne@@ ck , you &apos;re really prote@@ cting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experi@@ ment .
Here &apos;s what we find on te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
"So it see@@ ms that our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als do go@@ ver@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ a@@ tive sit@@ u@@ ations , like social thre@@ at sit@@ u@@ ations ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recor@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is wor@@ se than being he@@ ck@@ led ."
Pe@@ ople ha@@ te this .
"We then have these co@@ ders look at these tap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re blin@@ d to the hy@@ pothe@@ sis . They &apos;re blin@@ d to the condi@@ tions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re b@@ rin@@ ging to the spe@@ e@@ ch .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the effe@@ ct , or me@@ dia@@ ting the effe@@ ct ."
"So I said , f@@ ake it ti@@ ll you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a f@@ r@@ au@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ po@@ sto@@ r .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad car ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I was thro@@ wn out of a car , ro@@ l@@ led se@@ ver@@ al times ."
I was thro@@ wn from the car .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had identi@@ fi@@ ed with being smar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of colle@@ ge , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish colle@@ ge ."
I am an im@@ po@@ sto@@ r .
"You &apos;re going to sta@@ y , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"L@@ ike , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feel@@ ing ."
"L@@ ike , she can f@@ ake it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t f@@ ake it ti@@ ll you make it ."
F@@ ake it ti@@ ll you become it .
D@@ o it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ al@@ ize .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y twe@@ ak@@ s can le@@ ad to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ w@@ o minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
"D@@ on &apos;t leave that sit@@ u@@ ation feel@@ ing like , o@@ h , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .
"G@@ re@@ at crea@@ tivity . In times of need , we need great crea@@ tivity ."
"D@@ is@@ cus@@ s . Gre@@ at crea@@ tivity is as@@ ton@@ is@@ h@@ ing@@ ly , ab@@ sur@@ dly , ra@@ tion@@ ally , ir@@ ra@@ tion@@ ally powerful ."
"G@@ re@@ at crea@@ tivity can spre@@ ad to@@ l@@ er@@ ance , cham@@ pi@@ on fre@@ e@@ dom , make education see@@ m like a b@@ right idea ."
"( Laughter ) Gre@@ at crea@@ tivity can turn a spo@@ t@@ light on de@@ p@@ riv@@ ation , or show that de@@ p@@ riv@@ ation ain &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly so ."
"G@@ re@@ at crea@@ tivity can make poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans elec@@ table , or par@@ ties u@@ ne@@ le@@ c@@ table ."
It can make war see@@ m like tra@@ ge@@ dy or far@@ ce .
C@@ re@@ a@@ tivity is the me@@ me@@ -@@ mak@@ er that pu@@ ts s@@ log@@ ans on our t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts and ph@@ ras@@ es on our li@@ ps .
It &apos;s the path@@ fin@@ der that sho@@ ws us a simple ro@@ ad through an im@@ pen@@ e@@ tra@@ ble mor@@ al maz@@ e .
"S@@ ci@@ ence is cle@@ ver , but great crea@@ tivity is something less know@@ able , more mag@@ ical . And now we need that ma@@ gic ."
This is a time of need .
"O@@ ur cli@@ mate is chan@@ ging quickly , too quickly ."
And great crea@@ tivity is needed to do what it does so well : to pro@@ vo@@ ke us to think differ@@ ently with dra@@ mati@@ c crea@@ tive sta@@ te@@ ments .
To tem@@ pt us to act differ@@ ently with deli@@ gh@@ t@@ ful crea@@ tive s@@ c@@ rap@@ s .
Here is one such s@@ cra@@ p from an in@@ iti@@ a@@ tive I &apos;m invol@@ ved in using crea@@ tivity to inspi@@ re people to be gre@@ en@@ er .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : You know , rather than dri@@ ve today , I &apos;m going to walk ."
"N@@ ar@@ ra@@ tor : And so he wal@@ ked , and as he wal@@ ked he saw things ."
S@@ tr@@ an@@ ge and wonderful things he would not o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise have seen .
A de@@ er with an it@@ ch@@ y le@@ g . A fl@@ ying mo@@ tor@@ cy@@ cle .
A father and d@@ aughter se@@ para@@ ted from a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle by a my@@ s@@ teri@@ ous w@@ all .
And then he sto@@ pped . W@@ al@@ king in front of him was her .
The woman who as a child had sk@@ i@@ pped with him through fiel@@ ds and bro@@ k@@ en his heart .
"S@@ u@@ re , she had ag@@ ed a little ."
"In fact , she had ag@@ ed a lot ."
But he felt all his old passion for her re@@ turn .
"&quot; &quot; For@@ d , &quot; &quot; he called so@@ f@@ tly . F@@ or that was her name ."
"&quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t say another word , G@@ us@@ ty , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name ."
"&quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a car@@ av@@ an , exactly 3@@ 00 y@@ ar@@ ds from here ."
"L@@ et &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; For@@ d un@@ dre@@ s@@ sed . She spre@@ ad one le@@ g , and then the other ."

The ear@@ th mo@@ ved for both of them .
And they li@@ ved together hap@@ pi@@ ly ever after .
And all because he decided to walk that day .
"( Applause ) An@@ dy H@@ ob@@ s@@ b@@ aw@@ m : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the de@@ b@@ ate ."
The mor@@ al im@@ per@@ a@@ tive is on the table .
"G@@ re@@ at crea@@ tivity is needed to take it all , make it simple and shar@@ p ."
To make it conne@@ ct . To make it make people want to act .
"So this is a call , a ple@@ a , to the incredi@@ bly tal@@ en@@ ted TED community ."
Let &apos;s get crea@@ tive against cli@@ mate change .
And let &apos;s do it so@@ on . Thank you .
( Applause )
"B@@ e@@ a@@ u L@@ ot@@ to : So , this game is very simple ."
All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
"So , I &apos;m going to coun@@ t to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together ."
"O@@ kay , one , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ Au@@ dience : C@@ an you read this ?"
"B@@ L : A@@ maz@@ ing . What about this one ? One , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ Au@@ dience : You are not read@@ ing this ."
"B@@ L : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three ."
Au@@ dience : What are you read@@ ing ?
B@@ L : What are you read@@ ing ? There are no words there .
"I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?"
"It liter@@ ally says , &quot; &quot; W@@ at ar ou re@@ a in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?"
That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
It &apos;s because per@@ cep@@ tion is gro@@ un@@ ded in our experience .
"@@ Right ? The brain takes me@@ an@@ ing@@ less information and makes me@@ an@@ ing out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was u@@ se@@ ful to see in the past ."
"A@@ ll right ? Wh@@ ich means , when it comes to per@@ cep@@ tion , we &apos;re all like this fro@@ g ."
"( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s gener@@ ating behavior that &apos;s u@@ se@@ ful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : O@@ w ! O@@ w ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) B@@ L : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit an@@ noy@@ ed , right ?"
"But we &apos;re talking about per@@ cep@@ tion here , right ?"
"And per@@ cep@@ tion under@@ pin@@ s everything we think , we know , we believe , our ho@@ pes , our dre@@ am@@ s , the clo@@ thes we we@@ ar , f@@ all@@ ing in love , everything begin@@ s with per@@ cep@@ tion ."
"Now if per@@ cep@@ tion is gro@@ un@@ ded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever respon@@ ding ac@@ cor@@ ding to what we &apos;ve done before ."
"But actually , it &apos;s a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous problem , because how can we ever see differ@@ ently ?"
"Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differ@@ ently , and all new per@@ cep@@ tions beg@@ in in the same way ."
They beg@@ in with a question .
The problem with questions is they create un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"Now , un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ari@@ ly a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a pre@@ da@@ tor , it &apos;s too late ."
Okay ? ( Laughter ) E@@ ven se@@ as@@ ic@@ k@@ ness is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"@@ Right ? If you go down be@@ low on a bo@@ at , your in@@ ner ear@@ s are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Y@@ our eyes , because it &apos;s moving in re@@ g@@ is@@ ter with the bo@@ at , say I &apos;m standing still ."
"@@ Y@@ our brain cannot deal with the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of that information , and it gets ill ."
"The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dang@@ er@@ ous things you can do , because it takes you into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ."
"And yet , the i@@ ron@@ y is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space ."
"So how can we ever do anything new ? Well for@@ tu@@ na@@ tely , evol@@ ution has given us an answer , right ?"
And it en@@ ab@@ les us to ad@@ dre@@ ss even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
"It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life beg@@ in , or what ex@@ ten@@ ds be@@ y@@ ond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really ste@@ p@@ ping into that space ."
So what is evol@@ ution &apos;s answer to the problem of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . Ex@@ per@@ ts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
P@@ la@@ y is one of the only human en@@ de@@ av@@ ors where un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is actually c@@ ele@@ bra@@ ted . U@@ n@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is what makes play fu@@ n .
"@@ Right ? It &apos;s ad@@ ap@@ table to change . Right ? It open@@ s possi@@ bility , and it &apos;s co@@ oper@@ a@@ tive . It &apos;s actually how we do our social b@@ on@@ ding , and it &apos;s in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ cally motiv@@ ated . What that means is that we play to play . P@@ la@@ y is its own re@@ ward ."
"Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the ex@@ act same ways of being you need in order to be a good scienti@@ st ."
S@@ ci@@ ence is not defin@@ ed by the meth@@ od se@@ ction of a pap@@ er .
"It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is crea@@ tive ."
"So if you ad@@ d ru@@ les to play , you have a game ."
That &apos;s actually what an experi@@ ment is .
"So ar@@ med with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experi@@ ments are play , we asked , can any@@ one become a scienti@@ st ?"
And who better to ask than 25 eigh@@ t@@ - to 10@@ -@@ year-@@ old children ?
"Because they &apos;re ex@@ per@@ ts in play . So I took my be@@ e ar@@ ena down to a small school in D@@ ev@@ on , and the ai@@ m of this was to not just get the kids to see science differ@@ ently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differ@@ ently . Right ?"
The first step was to ask a question .
"Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get fun@@ ding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a u@@ se@@ ful con@@ tribu@@ tion to science , and the teach@@ ers said kids couldn &apos;t do it ."
So we did it any@@ way . Right ? O@@ f course .
"So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small prin@@ t so you wouldn &apos;t bo@@ ther read@@ ing it . Po@@ in@@ t is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the bas@@ is of science pub@@ li@@ c@@ ation the last five to 15 years . Right ?"
So they were as@@ king questions that were sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant to ex@@ per@@ t scientists .
"Now here , I want to share the sta@@ ge with someone quite speci@@ al . Right ?"
"She was one of the young people who was invol@@ ved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youn@@ gest pub@@ lis@@ hed scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes on@@ to sta@@ ge , will be the youn@@ gest person to ever speak at TED . Right ?"
"Now , science and as@@ king questions is about cou@@ rag@@ e ."
"Now she is the person@@ i@@ fic@@ ation of cou@@ rag@@ e , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all ."
"So A@@ my , would you ple@@ ase come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So A@@ my &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton Be@@ es Pro@@ ject , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go a@@ head , A@@ my ."
"A@@ my O &apos;@@ T@@ o@@ ole : Thank you , Be@@ a@@ u . We thought that it was easy to see the lin@@ k between humans and ap@@ es in the way that we think , because we look al@@ ike ."
"But we wonder@@ ed if there &apos;s a possible lin@@ k with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and be@@ es thought si@@ mil@@ ar , since they see@@ m so different from us ."
So we asked if humans and be@@ es might solve complex problems in the same way .
"@@ Re@@ ally , we wanted to know if be@@ es can also ad@@ ap@@ t themselves to new sit@@ u@@ ations using pre@@ vi@@ ously learned ru@@ les and condi@@ tions . So what if be@@ es can think like us ?"
"Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an in@@ se@@ ct with only one million brain cells ."
"But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because be@@ es , like us , can reco@@ gn@@ ize a good flo@@ wer re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the time of day , the light , the we@@ a@@ ther , or from any ang@@ le they appro@@ ach it from . ( Applause ) B@@ L : So the next step was to design an experi@@ ment , which is a game . So the kids went off and they desig@@ ned this experi@@ ment , and so — well , game — and so , A@@ my , can you tell us what the game was , and the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le that you set the be@@ es ?"
A@@ O : The pu@@ z@@ z@@ le we came up with was an i@@ f-@@ then ru@@ le .
"We asked the be@@ es to learn not just to go to a certain co@@ lor , but to a certain co@@ lor flo@@ wer only when it &apos;s in a certain patter@@ n ."
"They were only re@@ war@@ ded if they went to the y@@ el@@ low flo@@ wers if the y@@ el@@ low flo@@ wers were sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by the blu@@ e , or if the blu@@ e flo@@ wers were sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by the y@@ el@@ low ."
"Now there &apos;s a number of different ru@@ les the be@@ es can learn to solve this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le . The interesting question is , which ?"
"What was really exci@@ ting about this project was we , and Be@@ a@@ u , had no idea whether it would work ."
"It was completely new , and no one had done it before , inclu@@ ding ad@@ ul@@ ts . ( Laughter ) B@@ L : In@@ clu@@ ding the teach@@ ers , and that was really hard for the teach@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s easy for a scienti@@ st to go in and not have a clu@@ e what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the la@@ b , but for a teach@@ er not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the cre@@ di@@ t goes to D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ k , who was the col@@ lab@@ or@@ ato@@ r on this project . Okay ?"
"So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is ob@@ serv@@ ation . So here are some of the students doing the ob@@ serv@@ ations . They &apos;re recor@@ ding the data of where the be@@ es f@@ ly ."
( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ k : So what we &apos;re going to do — S@@ tu@@ dent : 5@@ C .
D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ k : I@@ s she still going up here ? S@@ tu@@ dent : Yeah .
"D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ k : So you keep tra@@ ck of e@@ ach@@ .@@ S@@ tu@@ dent : H@@ en@@ ry , can you help me here ?"
"B@@ L : &quot; &quot; C@@ an you help me , H@@ en@@ ry ? &quot; &quot; What good scienti@@ st says that , right ?"
S@@ tu@@ dent : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
B@@ L : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our ob@@ serv@@ ations . We &apos;ve got our data .
"They do the simple mathe@@ mati@@ cs , a@@ ver@@ ag@@ ing , e@@ t@@ c . , e@@ t@@ c ."
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to sub@@ m@@ it this for pub@@ li@@ c@@ ation . Right ? So we have to write it up .
"So we go , of course , to the pu@@ b . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is min@@ e , o@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a pap@@ er has four different se@@ ctions : an in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion , a meth@@ ods , a resul@@ ts , a dis@@ cus@@ sion ."
"The in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion says , what &apos;s the question and why ?"
"M@@ eth@@ ods , what did you do ? Re@@ sul@@ ts , what was the ob@@ serv@@ ation ?"
"And the dis@@ cus@@ sion is , who car@@ es ? Right ?"
"That &apos;s a science pap@@ er , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a nar@@ ra@@ tive , which means that this pap@@ er is w@@ rit@@ ten in k@@ id@@ speak ."
"It &apos;s not w@@ rit@@ ten by me . It &apos;s w@@ rit@@ ten by A@@ my and the other students in the clas@@ s . As a con@@ sequ@@ ence , this science pap@@ er begin@@ s , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce upo@@ n a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The resul@@ ts se@@ ction , it says : &quot; &quot; T@@ ra@@ in@@ ing ph@@ ase , the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le ... du@@ h du@@ h du@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the meth@@ ods , it says , &quot; &quot; Th@@ en we put the be@@ es into the fri@@ dge ( and made be@@ e pi@@ e ) , &quot; &quot; s@@ mi@@ le@@ y face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science pap@@ er . We &apos;re going to try to get it pub@@ lis@@ hed ."
So here &apos;s the ti@@ tle p@@ age . We have a number of au@@ th@@ ors there .
All the ones in b@@ old are eight to 10 years old .
"The first au@@ th@@ or is B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton P@@ ri@@ mar@@ y S@@ cho@@ ol , because if it were ever re@@ fer@@ en@@ ced , it would be &quot; &quot; B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individu@@ al . So we sub@@ m@@ it it to a public access jour@@ n@@ al , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this ."
"&quot; &quot; I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id the pap@@ er fa@@ il@@ s our in@@ iti@@ al qu@@ ality control che@@ cks in se@@ ver@@ al different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it star@@ ts off &quot; &quot; once upo@@ n a time , &quot; &quot; the figu@@ res are in cra@@ y@@ on , e@@ t@@ c . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it re@@ vie@@ wed . So I s@@ ent it to D@@ al@@ e P@@ ur@@ ves , who is at the Na@@ tional A@@ c@@ ade@@ my of S@@ ci@@ ence , one of the lead@@ ing neuro@@ scientists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most orig@@ in@@ al science pap@@ er I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it cer@@ tain@@ ly de@@ ser@@ ves wi@@ de ex@@ po@@ sure . &quot;"
"L@@ ar@@ ry M@@ alon@@ ey , ex@@ per@@ t in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The pap@@ er is mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent ."
The work would be pub@@ lis@@ ha@@ ble if done by ad@@ ul@@ ts . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We sen@@ d it back to the e@@ di@@ tor .
They say no .
"So we asked L@@ ar@@ ry and Na@@ tal@@ i@@ e H@@ em@@ pe@@ l to write a com@@ men@@ tar@@ y sit@@ u@@ ating the fin@@ din@@ gs for scientists , right , pu@@ tting in the re@@ fer@@ ences , and we sub@@ m@@ it it to B@@ io@@ logy Le@@ t@@ ters ."
"And there , it was re@@ vie@@ wed by five in@@ depen@@ dent re@@ fer@@ e@@ es , and it was pub@@ lis@@ hed . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it pub@@ lis@@ hed . ( Laughter ) T@@ y@@ pi@@ cal science , actually , right ? So this makes A@@ my and her friends the youn@@ gest pub@@ lis@@ hed scientists in the world ."
What was the fe@@ ed@@ back like ?
"Well , it was pub@@ lis@@ hed two days before Chris@@ t@@ mas , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ a@@ ded 3@@ 0,000 times in the first day , right ?"
"It was the E@@ di@@ tors &apos; C@@ ho@@ ice in S@@ ci@@ ence , which is a top science mag@@ az@@ ine ."
It &apos;s for@@ ever fre@@ ely ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble by B@@ io@@ logy Le@@ t@@ ters .
It &apos;s the only pap@@ er that will ever be fre@@ ely ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble by this jour@@ n@@ al .
"L@@ ast year , it was the secon@@ d-@@ most do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ a@@ ded pap@@ er by B@@ io@@ logy Le@@ t@@ ters , and the fe@@ ed@@ back from not just scientists and teach@@ ers but the public as well ."
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; &quot; I have read &apos; B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton Be@@ es &apos; re@@ cen@@ tly . I don &apos;t have words to expl@@ ain exactly how I am feel@@ ing right now .
"What you guys have done is real , true and amazing ."
"C@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , inter@@ est , inno@@ c@@ ence and z@@ e@@ al are the most bas@@ ic and most important things to do science ."
Wh@@ o else can have these qu@@ ali@@ ties more than children ?
P@@ le@@ ase con@@ gra@@ tu@@ late your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to con@@ clu@@ de with a physical me@@ tap@@ h@@ or .
"C@@ an I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , come on . Yeah ye@@ ah . Okay ."
"Now , science is about taking ris@@ ks , so this is an incredi@@ ble ris@@ k , right ? ( Laughter ) F@@ or me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?"
"S@@ h@@ im@@ on S@@ cho@@ ck@@ en : Right , but I like myself ."
B@@ L : This is the epi@@ to@@ me of technology . Right . Okay .
"Now ... ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion , right ?"
"You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me c@@ lap@@ ping . All right ?"
"( C@@ lap@@ ping ) ( C@@ lap@@ ping ) Okay , how about if everyone over there sh@@ ou@@ ts . One , two , three ?"
"Au@@ dience : ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) B@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time ."
E@@ very@@ one over there sh@@ out . ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) Wh@@ ere &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
"@@ Right ? We nor@@ m@@ ally walk through life respon@@ ding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty . Wh@@ en he open@@ ed his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way ."
"That &apos;s what science of@@ fer@@ s us . It of@@ fer@@ s the possi@@ bility to step on un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty through the process of play , right ?"
"Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and en@@ ab@@ ling to ex@@ pre@@ ss that voice , so I &apos;ve asked A@@ my to be the last voice in this shor@@ t story ."
"So , A@@ my ?"
"A@@ O : This project was really exci@@ ting for me , because it bro@@ ught the process of disco@@ very to life , and it sho@@ wed me that any@@ one , and I mean any@@ one , has the poten@@ tial to disco@@ ver something new , and that a small question can le@@ ad into a big disco@@ very ."
Ch@@ ang@@ ing the way a person thin@@ ks about something can be easy or hard . It all depen@@ ds on the way the person feel@@ s about change .
"But chan@@ ging the way I thought about science was surpris@@ ing@@ ly easy . O@@ n@@ ce we play@@ ed the g@@ ames and then started to think about the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a bor@@ ing sub@@ ject , and that any@@ one can disco@@ ver something new ."
"You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of Be@@ a@@ u , and the B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton Be@@ e Pro@@ ject ."
Thank y@@ ou@@ .@@ B@@ L : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
The year is 18@@ 00 .
A cu@@ ri@@ ous little inven@@ tion is being tal@@ ked about .
It &apos;s called a micro@@ s@@ co@@ pe .
What it allo@@ ws you to do is see tin@@ y little li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms that are in@@ visi@@ ble to the n@@ ak@@ ed ey@@ e .
So@@ on comes the medi@@ cal disco@@ very that many of these li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms are actually cau@@ ses of terri@@ ble human dis@@ eas@@ es .
"I@@ ma@@ gine what happened to the society when they realized that an Eng@@ lish mo@@ m in her te@@ ac@@ up actually was d@@ rin@@ king a mon@@ s@@ ter s@@ ou@@ p , not very far from here . This is from Lon@@ don ."
F@@ ast forward 200 years .

"You take a sta@@ in , like ac@@ ri@@ d@@ ine or@@ an@@ ge or a flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent sta@@ in or Gi@@ em@@ sa , and a micro@@ s@@ co@@ pe , and you look at them ."
They all have fac@@ es .
"Wh@@ y is that so , that A@@ le@@ x in Ken@@ y@@ a , F@@ a@@ tima in B@@ ang@@ la@@ des@@ h , N@@ av@@ jo@@ ot in M@@ um@@ b@@ ai , and J@@ u@@ li@@ e and M@@ ary in U@@ gan@@ da still wa@@ it months to be able to diagno@@ se why they are si@@ ck ?"
And that &apos;s pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly because scal@@ ability of the diagno@@ sti@@ cs is completely out of re@@ ach .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem lies with the micro@@ s@@ co@@ pe itself .
"E@@ ven though the pin@@ n@@ ac@@ le of mo@@ der@@ n science , research micro@@ s@@ co@@ pes are not desig@@ ned for field tes@@ ting ."
N@@ either were they first desig@@ ned for diagno@@ sti@@ cs at all .
"They are he@@ av@@ y , bu@@ l@@ k@@ y , really hard to main@@ tain , and cost a lot of money ."
This picture is Ma@@ ha@@ t@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i in the &apos; 4@@ 0s using the ex@@ act same se@@ tu@@ p that we actually use today for diagno@@ sing T@@ .@@ B@@ . in his as@@ h@@ ra@@ m in S@@ ev@@ ag@@ ra@@ m in India .
"T@@ w@@ o of my students , J@@ i@@ m and J@@ ames , tra@@ v@@ ele@@ d around India and Th@@ ail@@ and , star@@ ting to think about this problem a lot ."
We saw all kinds of don@@ ated e@@ qui@@ pment .
We saw fun@@ g@@ us growing on micro@@ s@@ co@@ pe len@@ ses .
And we saw people who had a fun@@ c@@ tional micro@@ s@@ co@@ pe but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
What gre@@ w out of that work and that tri@@ p was actually the idea of what we call F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ co@@ pes .
So what is a F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ co@@ pe ?
"A F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ co@@ pe is a completely fun@@ c@@ tional micro@@ s@@ co@@ pe , a pl@@ at@@ form for flu@@ or@@ es@@ c@@ ence , bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ field , pol@@ ar@@ ization , pro@@ je@@ ction , all kinds of advan@@ ced micro@@ s@@ co@@ py built pu@@ re@@ ly by fol@@ ding pap@@ er ."
"So , now you think , how is that possible ?"
"I &apos;m going to show you some exam@@ ples here , and we will run through some of them ."
It star@@ ts with a single sh@@ e@@ et of pap@@ er .
What you see here is all the possible com@@ pon@@ ents to build a fun@@ c@@ tional bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ field and flu@@ or@@ es@@ c@@ ence micro@@ s@@ co@@ pe .
"So , there are three sta@@ ges : There is the op@@ tical sta@@ ge , the il@@ lu@@ min@@ ation sta@@ ge and the mas@@ k@@ -@@ h@@ ol@@ ding sta@@ ge ."
And there are mi@@ c@@ ro op@@ tics at the bot@@ to@@ m that &apos;s actually em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the pap@@ er itself .
"What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are pla@@ ying like a toy , which it is , I ta@@ b it off , and I bre@@ ak it off ."
This pap@@ er has no in@@ struc@@ tions and no langu@@ ages .
"There is a co@@ de , a co@@ lor co@@ de em@@ be@@ d@@ ded , that tel@@ ls you exactly how to f@@ old that speci@@ fic micro@@ s@@ co@@ pe ."
"When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ali@@ ties of a stan@@ d@@ ard micro@@ s@@ co@@ pe , just like an X@@ Y sta@@ ge , a place where a s@@ am@@ ple sli@@ de could go , for example right here ."
"We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the stan@@ d@@ ard that &apos;s been op@@ ti@@ miz@@ ed for over the years , and many health wor@@ k@@ ers are actually used to this ."
"So this is what changes , but the stan@@ d@@ ard sta@@ ins all re@@ ma@@ in the same for many different dis@@ eas@@ es ."
You po@@ p this in .
"There is an X@@ Y sta@@ ge , and then there is a fo@@ c@@ using sta@@ ge , which is a f@@ lex@@ u@@ re me@@ chan@@ ism that &apos;s built in pap@@ er itself that allo@@ ws us to move and focu@@ s the len@@ ses by mi@@ c@@ ron ste@@ ps ."
"So what &apos;s really interesting about this ob@@ ject , and my students ha@@ te when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this any@@ way , is these are ru@@ g@@ ged dev@@ ices ."
I can turn it on and thro@@ w it on the flo@@ or and really try to sto@@ m@@ p on it .
"And they last , even though they &apos;re desig@@ ned from a very f@@ lex@@ i@@ ble materi@@ al , like pap@@ er ."
"A@@ no@@ ther fu@@ n fact is , this is what we actually sen@@ d out there as a stan@@ d@@ ard diagno@@ sti@@ c to@@ ol , but here in this en@@ velo@@ pe I have 30 different fol@@ d@@ s@@ co@@ pes of different con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions all in a single fol@@ der ."
And I &apos;m going to pi@@ ck one ran@@ dom@@ ly .
"This one , it turns out , is actually desig@@ ned speci@@ fic@@ ally for mal@@ aria , because it has the flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent fil@@ ters built speci@@ fic@@ ally for diagno@@ sing mal@@ aria ."
So the idea of very speci@@ fic diagno@@ sti@@ c micro@@ s@@ co@@ pes comes out of this .
"So up ti@@ ll now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these se@@ tu@@ ps ."
"So what I would like to do is , if we could di@@ m the li@@ ghts , ple@@ ase , it turns out fol@@ d@@ s@@ co@@ pes are also pro@@ je@@ ction micro@@ s@@ co@@ pes ."
"I have these two micro@@ s@@ co@@ pes that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the w@@ all — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see ."
"What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cro@@ ss@@ -@@ se@@ ction of a com@@ po@@ und ey@@ e , and when I &apos;m going to zo@@ om in clo@@ ser , right there , I am going through the z@@ -@@ ax@@ is ."
You actually see how the len@@ ses are c@@ ut together in the cro@@ ss@@ -@@ se@@ ction patter@@ n .
"A@@ no@@ ther example , one of my fav@@ or@@ ite in@@ se@@ cts , I love to ha@@ te this one , is a mos@@ qui@@ to , and you &apos;re seeing the an@@ ten@@ na of a cu@@ le@@ x pi@@ pi@@ ens ."
Right there .
All from the simple se@@ tu@@ p that I actually descri@@ bed .
So my wi@@ fe has been field tes@@ ting some of our micro@@ s@@ co@@ pes by was@@ hing my clo@@ thes wh@@ en@@ ever I for@@ get them in the d@@ ry@@ er .
"So it turns out they &apos;re wa@@ ter@@ pro@@ of , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this ."
This also sho@@ ws you how the pro@@ je@@ ction s@@ co@@ pe works .
You get to see the be@@ am the way it &apos;s pro@@ je@@ cted and b@@ ent .
C@@ an we get the li@@ ghts back on again ?
"So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time , in terms of how much it cos@@ ts for us to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture , the big@@ gest idea was ro@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ ro@@ ll man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , so we built this out of 50 cen@@ ts of parts and cos@@ ts ."
"( Applause ) And what this allo@@ ws us to do is to think about a new para@@ dig@@ m in micro@@ s@@ co@@ py , which we call u@@ se@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ thro@@ w micro@@ s@@ co@@ py ."
I &apos;m going to give you a quic@@ k s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some of the parts that go in .
Here is a sh@@ e@@ et of pap@@ er .
This is when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A@@ 4 sh@@ e@@ et of pap@@ er .
These are the three sta@@ ges that you actually see .
"And the op@@ tical com@@ pon@@ ents , if you look at the in@@ set up on the right , we had to figure out a way to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture len@@ ses in pap@@ er itself at really high thro@@ ugh@@ pu@@ ts , so it us@@ es a process of self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ bly and sur@@ face ten@@ sion to build ach@@ ro@@ mati@@ c len@@ ses in the pap@@ er itself ."
So that &apos;s where the len@@ ses go .
There are some light sour@@ ces .
"And es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally , in the end , all the parts line up because of orig@@ ami , because of the fact that orig@@ ami allo@@ ws us mi@@ c@@ ron@@ -@@ scale pre@@ c@@ is@@ ion of op@@ tical al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment ."
"So even though this looks like a simple toy , the as@@ pe@@ cts of engine@@ er@@ ing that go in something like this are fai@@ r@@ ly so@@ ph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated ."
"So here is another obvi@@ ous thing that we would do , ty@@ pic@@ ally , if I was going to show that these micro@@ s@@ co@@ pes are ro@@ b@@ ust , is go to the third flo@@ or and dro@@ p it from the flo@@ or itself ."
"There it is , and it sur@@ vi@@ ves ."
"So for us , the next step actually is really fin@@ is@@ hing our field tri@@ als ."
We are star@@ ting at the end of the sum@@ mer .
We are at a sta@@ ge where we &apos;ll be making thousands of micro@@ s@@ co@@ pes .
That would be the first time where we would be doing field tri@@ als with the high@@ est den@@ s@@ ity of micro@@ s@@ co@@ pes ever at a given place .
"We &apos;ve started colle@@ cting data for mal@@ aria , Ch@@ ag@@ as disease and gi@@ ar@@ dia from pati@@ ents themselves ."
And I want to leave you with this picture .
"I had not anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted this before , but a really interesting lin@@ k between h@@ and@@ s@@ -@@ on science education and global health ."
What are the tools that we &apos;re actually provi@@ ding the kids who are going to fi@@ ght this mon@@ s@@ ter s@@ ou@@ p for to@@ mor@@ row ?
I would love for them to be able to just prin@@ t out a F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ co@@ pe and car@@ ry them around in their po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts .
Thank you .
( Applause )
O@@ ur world has many super@@ her@@ o@@ es .
But they have the wor@@ st of all super@@ po@@ wers : in@@ visi@@ bility .
"For example , the ca@@ ta@@ dor@@ es , wor@@ k@@ ers who colle@@ ct rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able materi@@ als for a living ."
"C@@ a@@ ta@@ dor@@ es e@@ mer@@ ged from social in@@ equ@@ ality , u@@ ne@@ m@@ ploy@@ ment , and the ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance of so@@ li@@ d was@@ te from the de@@ fici@@ en@@ cy of the was@@ te colle@@ ction system ."
"C@@ a@@ ta@@ dor@@ es provi@@ de a he@@ av@@ y , hon@@ est and es@@ sen@@ tial work that ben@@ ef@@ its the entire population . But they are not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged for it ."
"@@ Here in Bra@@ zi@@ l , they colle@@ ct 90 percent of all the was@@ te that &apos;s actually rec@@ y@@ c@@ led ."
"M@@ os@@ t of the ca@@ ta@@ dor@@ es work in@@ depen@@ den@@ tly , pic@@ king was@@ te from the stre@@ ets and sel@@ ling to j@@ un@@ k y@@ ar@@ ds at very low pri@@ ces ."
"They may colle@@ ct over 3@@ 00 ki@@ los in their b@@ ag@@ s , sho@@ p@@ ping car@@ ts , b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ les and car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as ."
"C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are car@@ ts built from wo@@ od or meta@@ l and found in se@@ ver@@ al stre@@ ets in Bra@@ zi@@ l , much like graf@@ f@@ iti and stre@@ et art ."
And this is how I first met these mar@@ gin@@ al@@ ized super@@ her@@ o@@ es .
"I am a graf@@ f@@ iti arti@@ st and ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ t and my art is social , environ@@ mental and political in nature ."
"But at this time , giving voice to the ca@@ ta@@ dor@@ es ."
"B@@ y ad@@ ding art and hu@@ mor to the cause , it became more appe@@ al@@ ing , which hel@@ ped call atten@@ tion to the ca@@ ta@@ dor@@ es and impro@@ ve their self-@@ es@@ te@@ e@@ m ."
"And also , they are f@@ am@@ ous now on the stre@@ ets , on mas@@ s media and social ."
"So , the thing is , I pl@@ un@@ ged into this universe and have not sto@@ pped working since ."
I have pain@@ ted over 200 car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as in many cities and have been in@@ vi@@ ted to do ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions and tri@@ ps wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de .
"And then I realized that ca@@ ta@@ dor@@ es , in their in@@ visi@@ bility , are not ex@@ clu@@ sive to Bra@@ zi@@ l ."
"I met them in Ar@@ gen@@ ti@@ na , Ch@@ ile , Bo@@ li@@ via , S@@ outh Africa , T@@ ur@@ key and even in developed countries such as the United States and J@@ ap@@ an ."
And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people jo@@ in the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
"And then , I created a col@@ lab@@ ora@@ tive movement called P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a — ( Laughter ) — which is a large cro@@ w@@ d@@ fun@@ ded ev@@ ent ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
So P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a is a large cro@@ w@@ d@@ fun@@ ded ev@@ ent to help ca@@ ta@@ dor@@ es and their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
"C@@ a@@ ta@@ dor@@ es are as@@ sis@@ ted by wel@@ l@@ -@@ being pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ als and heal@@ th@@ care , like physi@@ ci@@ ans , den@@ tists , po@@ dia@@ tr@@ is@@ ts , h@@ air st@@ y@@ lis@@ ts , mas@@ s@@ age therap@@ is@@ ts and much more ."
"But also , they also rec@@ ei@@ ve sa@@ fe@@ ty sh@@ ir@@ ts , glo@@ ves , ra@@ in@@ co@@ a@@ ts and ey@@ eg@@ las@@ ses to see in high@@ -@@ defin@@ i@@ tion the city , while their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are ren@@ o@@ v@@ ated by our incredi@@ ble vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers ."
"And then they rec@@ ei@@ ve sa@@ fe@@ ty ite@@ ms , too : re@@ fle@@ ctive tap@@ es , hor@@ ns and mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r@@ s ."
"Th@@ en , finally , pain@@ ted by a stre@@ et arti@@ st and become part of part of this huge , amazing mo@@ bil@@ e art ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion ."
"P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a took to the stre@@ ets of S@@ ã@@ o P@@ au@@ lo , R@@ io de J@@ an@@ ei@@ ro and C@@ u@@ ri@@ ti@@ b@@ a ."
So ca@@ ta@@ dor@@ es are le@@ av@@ ing in@@ visi@@ bility behind and be@@ coming incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly re@@ spe@@ cted and val@@ u@@ ed .
"Because of their pi@@ m@@ ped car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , they are able to fi@@ ght back to pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , incre@@ ase their in@@ come and their inter@@ action with society ."
"T@@ ry to see the world as one , without b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies or fron@@ ti@@ ers ."
"B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , there are over 20 million ca@@ ta@@ dor@@ es wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
"So next time you see one , reco@@ gn@@ ize them as a v@@ ital part of our society ."
"M@@ u@@ ito ob@@ ri@@ ga@@ do , than@@ k you ."
"A@@ b@@ out a year and a half ago , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en L@@ aw@@ ler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 200@@ 7 on V@@ ir@@ tual Earth , bro@@ ught me over to become the archite@@ ct of B@@ ing M@@ ap@@ s , which is M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft &apos;s on@@ lin@@ e-@@ ma@@ p@@ ping ef@@ for@@ t ."
"In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on re@@ defin@@ ing the way ma@@ ps work on@@ line ."
And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of ma@@ p@@ ping and di@@ re@@ ction s@@ ite that one is used to .
"So , the first thing that you might no@@ tice about the ma@@ p@@ ping s@@ ite is just the flu@@ id@@ ity of the zo@@ om@@ ing and the pan@@ ning , which , if you &apos;re fami@@ li@@ ar at all with S@@ e@@ ad@@ rag@@ on , that &apos;s where it comes from ."
"M@@ ap@@ ping is , of course , not just about car@@ to@@ grap@@ h@@ y , it &apos;s also about ima@@ ger@@ y ."
"So , as we zo@@ om@@ -@@ in be@@ y@@ ond a certain level this re@@ sol@@ ves into a kind of Si@@ m C@@ it@@ y@@ -@@ like vir@@ tual view at 4@@ 5 de@@ gre@@ es ."
"This can be vie@@ wed from any of the car@@ din@@ al direc@@ tions to show you the 3@@ D struc@@ ture of the city , all the fac@@ ades ."
"Now , we see this space , this thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al environment , as being a can@@ v@@ as on which all sor@@ ts of ap@@ plic@@ ations can play out , and ma@@ p &apos;s direc@@ tions are really just one of them ."
"If you cli@@ ck on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve lau@@ n@@ ched ."
"So , for example , a couple of days after the dis@@ as@@ ter in H@@ a@@ iti , we had an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ma@@ p that sho@@ wed before and after pic@@ tures from the sk@@ y ."
"This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hy@@ per@@ -@@ local b@@ log@@ s in real time and ma@@ p@@ ping those stories , those en@@ tries to the places that are re@@ fer@@ red to on the b@@ log@@ s ."
It &apos;s wonderful .
But I &apos;m going to show you some more can@@ dy sort of stuff .
"So , we see the ima@@ ger@@ y , of course , not sto@@ p@@ ping at the sk@@ y ."
These little green bu@@ b@@ b@@ les re@@ present photo@@ syn@@ ths that us@@ ers have made .
"I &apos;m not going to di@@ ve into them either , but photo@@ syn@@ ths are in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted into the ma@@ p ."
E@@ very@@ thing that &apos;s cas@@ ed in blu@@ e is an area where we &apos;ve taken ima@@ ger@@ y on the ground as well .
"And so , when you f@@ ly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . Wh@@ en you f@@ ly down to the ground , and you see this kind of pan@@ ora@@ mic ima@@ ger@@ y , the first thing that you might no@@ tice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al under@@ standing of this environment as there is of the thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al city from ab@@ o@@ ve , so if I cli@@ ck on something to get a clo@@ ser view of it , then , the fact that that tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion looks as it does , is a fun@@ ction of all of that ge@@ ome@@ try , all of that 3@@ D under@@ standing behind this model ."
"Now , I &apos;ll show you a fu@@ n ap@@ p that — we &apos;ve been working on a col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation with our friends at F@@ li@@ ck@@ r ."
"This takes F@@ li@@ ck@@ r , ge@@ or@@ eg@@ is@@ ter@@ ed ima@@ ger@@ y and us@@ es photo@@ syn@@ th@@ -@@ like pro@@ ces@@ ses to conne@@ ct that ima@@ ger@@ y to our ima@@ ger@@ y , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually me@@ ant to pu@@ ll up , but — ( Laughter ) But no@@ tice — this is , of course , a popu@@ lar to@@ u@@ ris@@ t s@@ ite , and there are lots of pho@@ tos around here , and these pho@@ tos are all taken at different times ."
So this one was taken around five .
"So that &apos;s the F@@ li@@ ck@@ r pho@@ to , that &apos;s our ima@@ ger@@ y ."
"So you really see how this kind of cro@@ w@@ d-@@ sour@@ ced ima@@ ger@@ y is in@@ te@@ gra@@ ting , in a very de@@ ep way , into the ma@@ p itself ."
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"There are se@@ ver@@ al reas@@ ons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time tra@@ vel ."
"And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful h@@ isto@@ ri@@ c ima@@ ger@@ y in here , but there are some with hor@@ ses and car@@ ri@@ ages and so on as well ."
"But what &apos;s co@@ ol about this is that , not only is it au@@ g@@ men@@ ting this vis@@ ual re@@ presen@@ tation of the world with things that are coming in from us@@ ers , but it also is the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be sho@@ wing you more of in just a moment ."
Now I just made a tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion in@@ do@@ ors . That &apos;s also interesting .
"O@@ K , no@@ tice there &apos;s now a ro@@ of ab@@ o@@ ve us ."
We &apos;re inside the P@@ ike P@@ l@@ ace M@@ arke@@ t .
"And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a bac@@ k@@ p@@ ack ca@@ mera , so , we &apos;re now not only ima@@ ging in the stre@@ et with this ca@@ mera on to@@ ps of cars , but we &apos;re also ima@@ ging inside ."
"And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sor@@ ts of re@@ g@@ is@@ tra@@ tion , not only of still images , but also of video ."
"So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , tru@@ ly , very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) O@@ K .
"( R@@ ing@@ ing ) All right , guys , are you there ?"
( No@@ ise ) All right . I &apos;m h@@ it@@ ting it . I &apos;m p@@ un@@ ching play .
I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
"So , these are our friends in P@@ ike P@@ l@@ ace M@@ arke@@ t , the la@@ b ."
( Applause ) So they &apos;re bro@@ ad@@ cas@@ ting this live .
"O@@ K , G@@ e@@ or@@ ge , can you pan back over to the cor@@ ner market ?"
Because I want to show poin@@ ts of inter@@ est .
"N@@ o , no . The other way ."
"@@ Yeah , ye@@ ah , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
"O@@ K , O@@ K , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
"O@@ K , never mind ."
"What I wanted to show you was these poin@@ ts of inter@@ est over here on top of the image because what that gi@@ ves you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spo@@ t , you can think about this — this is taking a step in ad@@ di@@ tion to au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality ."
"What the h@@ ell are you guys — o@@ h , sor@@ ry ."
"( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — O@@ K , I &apos;m h@@ ang@@ ing up now ."
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is to take that real ...
"( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and than@@ k the team ."
They &apos;ve done a fantas@@ tic job of pu@@ l@@ ling this together .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to ab@@ an@@ don them now and walk back outside .
"And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just men@@ tion that here we &apos;re using this for tele@@ pres@@ ence , but you can equ@@ ally well use this on the spo@@ t , for au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality ."
"When you use it on the spo@@ t , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that meta@@ data and information about the world to you ."
"So here , we &apos;re taking the ex@@ tra step of also bro@@ ad@@ cas@@ ting it ."
"That was being bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast , by the way , on a 4@@ G net@@ work from the market ."
"A@@ ll right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft has given in the past se@@ ver@@ al years ."
"And that &apos;s C@@ ur@@ tis W@@ on@@ g , Wor@@ l@@ d@@ W@@ i@@ de T@@ ele@@ s@@ co@@ pe ."
"So , we &apos;re going to head over to the du@@ m@@ ps@@ ters , where it &apos;s tradi@@ tional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a bre@@ ak , but also st@@ are up at the sk@@ y ."
This is the in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion of Wor@@ l@@ d@@ W@@ i@@ de T@@ ele@@ s@@ co@@ pe into our ma@@ ps .
"( Applause ) This is the cur@@ r@@ ent — than@@ k you — this is the cur@@ r@@ ent time . If we s@@ c@@ ru@@ b the time , then we can see how the sk@@ y will look at different times , and we can get all of this very de@@ tai@@ led information about different times , different da@@ tes : Let &apos;s move the mo@@ on a little high@@ er in the sk@@ y , maybe change the d@@ ate ."
I would like to kind of zo@@ om in on the mo@@ on .
"So , this is an as@@ tro@@ no@@ mi@@ cally comple@@ te re@@ presen@@ tation of the sk@@ y in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted right into the Earth ."
"A@@ ll right now , I &apos;ve over@@ run my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop ."
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
"I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back ."
And let me start with this .
"This is my bas@@ el@@ ine : This is the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ ean co@@ ast with no fish , b@@ are ro@@ ck and lots of se@@ a u@@ rch@@ ins that like to e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
S@@ ome@@ thing like this is what I first saw when I j@@ um@@ ped in the water for the first time in the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ ean co@@ ast off S@@ pa@@ in .
"Now , if an ali@@ en came to ear@@ th — let &apos;s call him Jo@@ e — what would Jo@@ e see ?"
"If Jo@@ e j@@ um@@ ped in a cor@@ al re@@ ef , there are many things the ali@@ en could see ."
"V@@ er@@ y un@@ lik@@ ely , Jo@@ e would j@@ um@@ p on a pris@@ tin@@ e cor@@ al re@@ ef , a vi@@ rg@@ in cor@@ al re@@ ef with lots of cor@@ al , shar@@ ks , cro@@ co@@ di@@ les , man@@ ate@@ es , gro@@ uper@@ s , tur@@ t@@ les , e@@ t@@ c ."
"So , probably , what Jo@@ e would see would be in this part , in the gre@@ en@@ ish part of the picture ."
"@@ Here we have the extre@@ me with de@@ ad cor@@ als , micro@@ bi@@ al s@@ ou@@ p and j@@ el@@ ly@@ fish ."
"And where the di@@ ver is , this is probably where most of the re@@ ef@@ s of the world are now , with very few cor@@ als , al@@ ga@@ e over@@ growing the cor@@ als , lots of bac@@ teria , and where the large animals are gone ."
And this is what most mar@@ ine scientists have seen too .
This is their bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what they think is natural because we started mo@@ der@@ n science with s@@ cu@@ b@@ a di@@ ving long after we started de@@ gra@@ ding mar@@ ine e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ ms .
"So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the oc@@ ean was like ."
"And let &apos;s start with this time machine , the L@@ ine Is@@ lan@@ ds , where we have con@@ duc@@ ted a ser@@ ies of Na@@ tional G@@ e@@ og@@ rap@@ hi@@ c expe@@ di@@ tions ."
"This se@@ a is an arch@@ i@@ pe@@ l@@ ago be@@ lon@@ ging to K@@ i@@ ri@@ b@@ ati that s@@ pan@@ s across the equ@@ ato@@ r and it has se@@ ver@@ al un@@ in@@ ha@@ bi@@ ted , un@@ fis@@ hed , pris@@ tin@@ e is@@ lan@@ ds and a few in@@ ha@@ bi@@ ted is@@ lan@@ ds ."
"So let &apos;s start with the first one : Chris@@ t@@ mas Is@@ land , over 5@@ ,000 people ."
"M@@ os@@ t of the re@@ ef@@ s are de@@ ad , most of the cor@@ als are de@@ ad — over@@ gro@@ wn by al@@ ga@@ e — and most of the fish are sm@@ al@@ ler than the pen@@ c@@ il@@ s we use to coun@@ t them ."
We did 2@@ 50 hours of di@@ ving here in 200@@ 5 .
We didn &apos;t see a single shar@@ k .
This is the place that C@@ ap@@ tain C@@ o@@ ok disco@@ vered in 1@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7 and he descri@@ bed a huge ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance of shar@@ ks bi@@ ting the ru@@ dd@@ ers and the o@@ ars of their small bo@@ a@@ ts while they were going as@@ hor@@ e .
Let &apos;s move the di@@ al a little bit to the past .
"F@@ an@@ ning Is@@ land , 2@@ ,@@ 500 people ."
The cor@@ als are doing better here . L@@ ots of small fish .
This is what many di@@ ver@@ s would consi@@ der par@@ ad@@ ise .
This is where you can see most of the F@@ l@@ or@@ ida K@@ e@@ ys Na@@ tional Mar@@ ine S@@ an@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
"And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your bas@@ el@@ ine ."
"If we go back to a place like P@@ al@@ my@@ ra A@@ to@@ ll , where I was with J@@ ere@@ my J@@ ac@@ k@@ son a few years ago , the cor@@ als are doing better and there are shar@@ ks ."
You can see shar@@ ks in every single di@@ ve .
And this is something that is very un@@ usu@@ al in today &apos;s cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s .
"But then , if we shi@@ ft the di@@ al 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the cor@@ als are absolu@@ tely heal@@ th@@ y and gor@@ ge@@ ous , for@@ ming spe@@ c@@ ta@@ cu@@ lar struc@@ tures , and where the pre@@ da@@ tors are the most con@@ spi@@ cu@@ ous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 shar@@ ks per di@@ ve ."
What have we learned from these places ?
This is what we thought was natural .
This is what we call the bio@@ mas@@ s p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ d .
"If we get all of the fish of a cor@@ al re@@ ef together and w@@ ei@@ gh them , this is what we would expe@@ ct ."
"M@@ os@@ t of the bio@@ mas@@ s is low on the food ch@@ ain , the her@@ bi@@ v@@ ores , the par@@ ro@@ t@@ fish , the sur@@ ge@@ on@@ fish that e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
"Th@@ en the plan@@ k@@ ton fe@@ ed@@ ers , these little d@@ am@@ sel@@ fish , the little animals flo@@ ating in the water ."
"And then we have a lo@@ wer bio@@ mas@@ s of car@@ ni@@ v@@ ores , and a lo@@ wer bio@@ mas@@ s of top head , or the shar@@ ks , the large s@@ n@@ ap@@ per@@ s , the large gro@@ uper@@ s ."
But this is a con@@ sequ@@ ence .
This view of the world is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of having stu@@ died de@@ gra@@ ded re@@ ef@@ s .
"When we went to pris@@ tin@@ e re@@ ef@@ s , we realized that the natural world was up@@ side down ; this p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ d was in@@ ver@@ ted ."
"The top head does ac@@ coun@@ t for most of the bio@@ mas@@ s , in some places up to 8@@ 5 percent , like K@@ ing@@ man Re@@ ef , which is now prote@@ cted ."
"The good news is that , in ad@@ di@@ tion to having more pre@@ da@@ tors , there &apos;s more of everything ."
The size of these bo@@ x@@ es is big@@ ger .
"We have more shar@@ ks , more bio@@ mas@@ s of s@@ n@@ ap@@ per@@ s , more bio@@ mas@@ s of her@@ bi@@ v@@ ores , too , like these par@@ ro@@ t fish that are like mar@@ ine go@@ a@@ ts ."
"They cle@@ an the re@@ ef ; everything that gro@@ ws enough to be seen , they e@@ at , and they keep the re@@ ef cle@@ an and al@@ low the cor@@ als to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish ."
"N@@ ot only do these places — these an@@ ci@@ ent , pris@@ tin@@ e places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important com@@ pon@@ ents of the e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m like the gi@@ ant c@@ la@@ ms ; pa@@ ve@@ ments of gi@@ ant c@@ la@@ ms in the l@@ ag@@ o@@ ons , up to 20 , 25 per squ@@ are me@@ ter ."
"Th@@ ese have dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed from every in@@ ha@@ bi@@ ted re@@ ef in the world , and they fil@@ ter the water ; they keep the water cle@@ an from micro@@ bes and path@@ o@@ gen@@ s ."
"But still , now we have global war@@ ming ."
"If we don &apos;t have fis@@ hing because these re@@ ef@@ s are prote@@ cted by la@@ w or their re@@ m@@ ot@@ en@@ ess , this is great ."
But the water gets war@@ mer for too long and the cor@@ als die .
"So how are these fish , these pre@@ da@@ tors going to help ?"
"Well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during E@@ l N@@ ino , year &apos; 9@@ 7 , &apos; 9@@ 8 , the water was too war@@ m for too long , and many cor@@ als b@@ le@@ ach@@ ed and many died ."
"In Chris@@ t@@ mas , where the food we@@ b is really tri@@ m@@ med down , where the large animals are gone , the cor@@ als have not reco@@ vered ."
"In F@@ an@@ ning Is@@ land , the cor@@ als are not reco@@ vered ."
But you see here a big table cor@@ al that died and col@@ lap@@ sed .
"And the fish have gra@@ z@@ ed the al@@ ga@@ e , so the tur@@ f of al@@ ga@@ e is a little lo@@ wer ."
"Th@@ en you go to P@@ al@@ my@@ ra A@@ to@@ ll that has more bio@@ mas@@ s of her@@ bi@@ v@@ ores , and the de@@ ad cor@@ als are cle@@ an , and the cor@@ als are coming back ."
"And when you go to the pris@@ tin@@ e side , did this ever b@@ le@@ ach ?"
"Th@@ ese places b@@ le@@ ach@@ ed too , but they reco@@ vered fas@@ ter ."
"The more in@@ ta@@ ct , the more comple@@ te , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food we@@ b , the high@@ er the re@@ si@@ li@@ ence , &#91; and &#93; the more lik@@ ely that the system is going to reco@@ ver from the shor@@ t-@@ ter@@ m imp@@ ac@@ ts of war@@ ming ev@@ ents ."
"And that &apos;s good news , so we need to reco@@ ver that struc@@ ture ."
We need to make sure that all of the pie@@ ces of the e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m are there so the e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m can ad@@ ap@@ t to the effe@@ cts of global war@@ ming .
"So if we have to re@@ set the bas@@ el@@ ine , if we have to pus@@ h the e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m back to the left , how can we do it ?"
"Well , there are se@@ ver@@ al ways ."
"One very cle@@ ar way is the mar@@ ine prote@@ cted are@@ as , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves that we set as@@ i@@ de to al@@ low for the reco@@ very for mar@@ ine life ."
And let me go back to that image of the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ ean .
This was my bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what I saw when I was a ki@@ d .
"And at the same time I was wat@@ ching J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u &apos;s sho@@ ws on T@@ V , with all this ri@@ ch@@ ness and ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance and di@@ versity ."
"And I thought that this ri@@ ch@@ ness be@@ lon@@ ged to tro@@ pi@@ cal se@@ as , and that the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ ean was a na@@ tur@@ ally po@@ or se@@ a ."
"But , little did I know , until I j@@ um@@ ped for the first time in a mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve ."
"And this is what I saw , lots of fish ."
"A@@ f@@ ter a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they e@@ at the u@@ rch@@ ins , and then the al@@ ga@@ e grow again ."
"So you have this little al@@ g@@ al for@@ est , and in the size of a lap@@ top you can find more than 100 species of al@@ ga@@ e , mo@@ st@@ ly micro@@ s@@ co@@ pi@@ c f@@ it hundre@@ ds of species of little animals that then fe@@ ed the fish , so that the system reco@@ ver@@ s ."
"And this particular place , the Me@@ des Is@@ lan@@ ds Mar@@ ine R@@ es@@ er@@ ve , is only 9@@ 4 he@@ c@@ tar@@ es , and it b@@ rin@@ gs 6 million eu@@ ros to the local economy , 20 times more than fis@@ hing , and it re@@ presen@@ ts 8@@ 8 percent of all the to@@ u@@ ris@@ t re@@ ven@@ ue ."
So these places not only help the e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m but also help the people who can ben@@ ef@@ it from the e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m .
So let me just give you a sum@@ mar@@ y of what no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves do .
"Th@@ ese places , when we prote@@ ct them , if we com@@ par@@ e them to un@@ prote@@ cted are@@ as ne@@ ar@@ by , this is what happens ."
"The number of species incre@@ as@@ es 2@@ 1 percent ; so if you have 1@@ ,000 species you would expe@@ ct 200 more in a mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve ."
This is very sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al .
"The size of organis@@ ms incre@@ as@@ es a third , so your fish are now this big ."
"The ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance , how many fish you have per squ@@ are me@@ ter , incre@@ as@@ es almost 1@@ 70 percent ."
"And the bio@@ mas@@ s — this is the most spe@@ c@@ ta@@ cu@@ lar change — 4@@ .@@ 5 times gre@@ ater bio@@ mas@@ s on a@@ verage , just after five to seven years ."
In some places up to 10 times lar@@ ger bio@@ mas@@ s inside the re@@ ser@@ ves .
"So we have all these things inside the re@@ ser@@ ve that grow , and what do they do ?"
They re@@ pro@@ duce . That &apos;s population bio@@ logy 10@@ 1 .
"If you don &apos;t k@@ ill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow lar@@ ger and they re@@ pro@@ duce a lot ."
And same thing for in@@ ver@@ te@@ bra@@ tes . This is the example .
"Th@@ ese are eg@@ g cas@@ es l@@ aid by a s@@ n@@ ai@@ l off the co@@ ast of Ch@@ ile , and this is how many eg@@ gs they la@@ y on the bot@@ to@@ m ."
"O@@ u@@ t@@ side the re@@ ser@@ ve , you cannot even de@@ te@@ ct this ."
One point three million eg@@ gs per squ@@ are me@@ ter inside the mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve where these s@@ na@@ il@@ s are very ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant .
"So these organis@@ ms re@@ pro@@ duce , the little lar@@ va@@ e ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es sp@@ ill over , they all sp@@ ill over , and then people can ben@@ ef@@ it from them outside too ."
This is in the B@@ a@@ ha@@ mas : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u gro@@ u@@ per .
"H@@ u@@ ge ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance of gro@@ uper@@ s inside the re@@ ser@@ ve , and the clo@@ ser you get to the re@@ ser@@ ve , the more fish you have ."
So the fis@@ her@@ men are c@@ at@@ ching more .
You can see where the lim@@ its of the re@@ ser@@ ve are because you see the bo@@ a@@ ts lin@@ ed up .
"So there is sp@@ ill over ; there are ben@@ ef@@ its be@@ y@@ ond the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies of these re@@ ser@@ ves that help people around them , while at the same time the re@@ ser@@ ve is prote@@ cting the entire ha@@ b@@ it@@ at . It is building re@@ si@@ li@@ ence ."
So what we have now — or a world without re@@ ser@@ ves — is like a de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ t where we with@@ dra@@ w all the time and we never make any de@@ posi@@ t .
R@@ es@@ er@@ ves are like sav@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts .
"We have this prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al that we don &apos;t to@@ uch ; that produc@@ es re@@ turns , social , economic and e@@ co@@ log@@ ical ."
"And if we think about the incre@@ ase of bio@@ mas@@ s inside the re@@ ser@@ ves , this is like com@@ po@@ und inter@@ est ."
"T@@ w@@ o exam@@ ples , again , of how these re@@ ser@@ ves can ben@@ ef@@ it people ."
"This is how much fis@@ her@@ men get every@@ day in Ken@@ y@@ a , fis@@ hing over a ser@@ ies of years , in a place where there is no prote@@ ction ; it &apos;s a fre@@ e-@@ for@@ -@@ all ."
"O@@ n@@ ce the most de@@ gra@@ ding fis@@ hing ge@@ ar , se@@ ine ne@@ ts , were re@@ mo@@ ved , the fis@@ her@@ men were c@@ at@@ ching more ."
"If you fish less , you &apos;re actually c@@ at@@ ching more ."
"But if we ad@@ d the no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ve on top of that , the fis@@ her@@ men are still making more money by fis@@ hing less around an area that is prote@@ cted ."
A@@ no@@ ther example : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u gro@@ uper@@ s in B@@ eli@@ ze in the M@@ es@@ o@@ a@@ mer@@ ic@@ an Re@@ ef .
"This is gro@@ u@@ per sex , and the gro@@ uper@@ s ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate around the full mo@@ ons of De@@ c@@ em@@ ber and J@@ an@@ u@@ ary for a week ."
"They used to ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate up to the ten@@ s of thousands , 3@@ 0,000 gro@@ uper@@ s about this big in one he@@ c@@ t@@ are , in one ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ation ."
"F@@ is@@ her@@ men knew about these things ; they cau@@ ght them , and they de@@ ple@@ ted them ."
"When I went there for the first time in 2@@ 000 , there were only 3@@ ,000 gro@@ uper@@ s left ."
And the fis@@ her@@ men were au@@ thor@@ ized to c@@ at@@ ch 30 percent of the entire s@@ pa@@ w@@ ning population every year .
"So we did a simple analy@@ sis , and it doesn &apos;t take ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fis@@ her@@ y is going to col@@ lap@@ se very quickly ."
"And with the fis@@ her@@ y , the entire re@@ produc@@ tive ability of the species goes ex@@ tin@@ ct ."
It happened in many places around the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an .
"And they would make 4@@ ,000 dollars per year , to@@ tal , for the entire fis@@ her@@ y , se@@ ver@@ al fis@@ hing bo@@ a@@ ts ."
"Now , if you do an economic analy@@ sis and project what would happen if the fish were not c@@ ut , if we bro@@ ught just 20 di@@ ver@@ s one mon@@ th per year , the re@@ ven@@ ue would be more than 20 times high@@ er and that would be susta@@ in@@ able over time ."
So how much of this do we have ?
"If this is so good , if this is such a no@@ -@@ bra@@ in@@ er , how much of this do we have ?"
And you already heard that less than one percent of the oc@@ ean &apos;s prote@@ cted .
"We &apos;re getting clo@@ ser to one percent now , than@@ ks to the prote@@ ctions of the Ch@@ ag@@ os Ar@@ chi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago , and only a fra@@ ction of this is fully prote@@ cted from fis@@ hing ."
S@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic stu@@ dies re@@ com@@ men@@ d that at least 20 percent of the oc@@ ean should be prote@@ cted .
The esti@@ ma@@ ted ran@@ ge is between 20 and 50 percent for a ser@@ ies of go@@ als of bi@@ odi@@ versity and fis@@ her@@ y en@@ h@@ an@@ ce@@ ment and re@@ si@@ li@@ ence .
"Now , is this possible ? Pe@@ ople would ask : How much would that cost ?"
"Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are pa@@ ying now to sub@@ si@@ di@@ ze fis@@ hing : 3@@ 5 billion dollars per year ."
M@@ any of these sub@@ si@@ dies go to de@@ struc@@ tive fis@@ hing prac@@ ti@@ ces .
"Well , there are a couple esti@@ ma@@ tes of how much it would cost to create a net@@ work of prote@@ cted are@@ as co@@ ver@@ ing 20 percent of the oc@@ ean that would be only a fra@@ ction of what we are now pa@@ ying ; the government hands out to a fis@@ her@@ y that is col@@ lap@@ sing ."
Pe@@ ople are lo@@ sing their j@@ ob@@ s because the fis@@ her@@ ies are col@@ lap@@ sing .
A cre@@ ation of a net@@ work of re@@ ser@@ ves would provi@@ de di@@ re@@ ct em@@ ploy@@ ment for more than a million people pl@@ us all the secon@@ d@@ ary j@@ ob@@ s and all the secon@@ d@@ ary ben@@ ef@@ its .
So how can we do that ?
"If it &apos;s so cle@@ ar that these sav@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the oc@@ ean ?"
And how can we re@@ ach that go@@ al ?
"Well , there are two ways of getting there ."
The tri@@ vi@@ al solution is to create really large prote@@ cted are@@ as like the Ch@@ ag@@ os Ar@@ chi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago .
"The problem is that we can create these large re@@ ser@@ ves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social con@@ fli@@ ct , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low ."
"And a few of us , a few organ@@ iz@@ ations in this room and el@@ se@@ where are working on this ."
"But what about the rest of the co@@ ast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fis@@ hing ?"
"Well , there are three ma@@ in reas@@ ons why we don &apos;t have ten@@ s of thousands of small re@@ ser@@ ves : The first one is that people have no idea what mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ves do , and fis@@ her@@ men ten@@ d to be really , really de@@ f@@ en@@ sive when it comes to re@@ gu@@ la@@ ting or clo@@ sing an area , even if it &apos;s small ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , the govern@@ ance is not right because most co@@ as@@ tal comm@@ uni@@ ties around the world don &apos;t have the au@@ thor@@ ity to mon@@ i@@ tor the resour@@ ces to create the re@@ ser@@ ve and en@@ for@@ ce it ."
It &apos;s a top down hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical struc@@ ture where people wa@@ it for government ag@@ ents to come and this is not effe@@ ctive . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough resour@@ ces .
"Wh@@ ich takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more re@@ ser@@ ves , is that the fun@@ ding mode@@ ls have been wrong ."
"N@@ G@@ O@@ s and govern@@ ments spend a lot of time and energy and resour@@ ces in a few small are@@ as , usu@@ ally ."
"So mar@@ ine con@@ serv@@ ation and co@@ as@@ tal prote@@ ction has become a sin@@ k for government or ph@@ il@@ anthro@@ pi@@ c money , and this is not susta@@ in@@ able ."
So the solu@@ tions are just fi@@ x@@ ing these three issu@@ es .
"F@@ ir@@ st , we need to develo@@ p a global a@@ war@@ en@@ ess cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n to inspi@@ re local comm@@ uni@@ ties and govern@@ ments to create no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves that are better than what we have now ."
It &apos;s the sav@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts ver@@ su@@ s the de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ ts with no de@@ pos@@ its .
"S@@ econ@@ d , we need to re@@ design our govern@@ ance so con@@ serv@@ ation ef@@ for@@ ts can be de@@ cen@@ tr@@ al@@ ized , so con@@ serv@@ ation ef@@ for@@ ts don &apos;t depen@@ d on work from N@@ G@@ O@@ s or from government ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es and can be created by the local comm@@ uni@@ ties , like it happens in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ pin@@ es and a few other places ."
"And third , and very important , we need to develo@@ p new business mode@@ ls ."
The ph@@ il@@ anthro@@ py sin@@ k as the only way to create re@@ ser@@ ves is not susta@@ in@@ able .
"We really need to develo@@ p mode@@ ls , business mode@@ ls , where co@@ as@@ tal con@@ serv@@ ation is an inv@@ es@@ t@@ ment , because we already know that these mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ves provi@@ de social , e@@ co@@ log@@ ical and economic ben@@ ef@@ its ."
"And I &apos;d like to fin@@ ish with one thought , which is that no one organ@@ ization alone is going to sa@@ ve the oc@@ ean ."
"There has been a lot of compe@@ ti@@ tion in the past , and we need to develo@@ p a new model of par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship , tru@@ ly col@@ lab@@ ora@@ tive , where we are looking for comple@@ men@@ ting , not sub@@ stitu@@ ting ."
The sta@@ kes are just too high to contin@@ ue the way we are going .
So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Thank you En@@ ri@@ c .
En@@ ri@@ c S@@ al@@ a : Thank you .
C@@ A : That was a mas@@ ter@@ ful job of pu@@ l@@ ling things together .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , your p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ d , your in@@ ver@@ ted p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ d , sho@@ wing 8@@ 5 percent bio@@ mas@@ s in the pre@@ da@@ tors , that see@@ ms im@@ possible ."
How could 8@@ 5 percent sur@@ vi@@ ve on 15 percent ?
"E@@ S : Well , imagine that you have two ge@@ ars of a wat@@ ch , a big one and a small one ."
"The big one is moving very s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , and the small one is moving f@@ ast ."
That &apos;s basically it .
"The animals at the lo@@ wer parts of the food ch@@ ain , they re@@ pro@@ duce very f@@ ast ; they grow really f@@ ast ; they pro@@ duce mil@@ lions of eg@@ gs ."
"U@@ p there , you have shar@@ ks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years ."
"They re@@ pro@@ duce very s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ; they have a s@@ low meta@@ b@@ ol@@ ism ; and , basically , they just main@@ tain their bio@@ mas@@ s ."
"So , basically , the produc@@ tion sur@@ pl@@ us of these guys down there is enough to main@@ tain this bio@@ mas@@ s that is not moving ."
They are like cap@@ ac@@ i@@ tors of the system .
C@@ A : That &apos;s very fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating .
"So , really , our picture of a food p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ d is just — we have to change that completely ."
E@@ S : A@@ t least in the se@@ as .
"What we found in cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s is that the in@@ ver@@ ted p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ d is the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of the S@@ er@@ en@@ ge@@ ti , with five lions per wil@@ de@@ be@@ est ."
"And on land , this cannot work ."
But at least on cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s are systems where there is a bot@@ to@@ m com@@ pon@@ ent with struc@@ ture .
We think this is uni@@ vers@@ al .
But we have started stu@@ dy@@ ing pris@@ tin@@ e re@@ ef@@ s only very re@@ cen@@ tly .
C@@ A : So the numbers you presen@@ ted really are as@@ ton@@ is@@ hing .
You &apos;re saying we &apos;re spen@@ ding 3@@ 5 billion dollars now on sub@@ si@@ dies .
It would only cost 1@@ 6 billion to set up 20 percent of the oc@@ ean as mar@@ ine prote@@ cted are@@ as that actually give new living cho@@ ices to the fis@@ her@@ men as well .
"If the world was a smar@@ ter place , we could solve this problem for ne@@ ga@@ tive 1@@ 9 billion dollars ."
We &apos;ve got 1@@ 9 billion to spend on health care or something .
E@@ S : And then we have the under@@ -@@ perfor@@ man@@ ce of fis@@ her@@ ies that is 50 billion dollars .
"So again , one of the big solu@@ tions is have the Wor@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ gan@@ ization shi@@ f@@ ting the sub@@ si@@ dies to susta@@ in@@ able prac@@ ti@@ ces ."
"C@@ A : Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of exam@@ ples that I &apos;m hear@@ ing out there about en@@ ding this sub@@ si@@ dies ma@@ d@@ ness ."
So than@@ k you for those numbers .
The last one &apos;s a person@@ al question .
"A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oc@@ e@@ ans for a long time has just been seeing this de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting wor@@ se , de@@ pre@@ ss@@ ing ."
T@@ al@@ k to me about the feel@@ ing that you must have experi@@ en@@ ced of going to these pris@@ tin@@ e are@@ as and seeing things coming back .
E@@ S : It is a spi@@ rit@@ ual experience .
"We go there to try to understand the e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ ms , to try to measu@@ re or coun@@ t fish and shar@@ ks and see how these places are different from the places we know ."
"But the best feel@@ ing is this bio@@ ph@@ ilia that E@@ .@@ O@@ . W@@ il@@ son tal@@ ks about , where humans have this sense of a@@ we and won@@ der in front of un@@ ta@@ med nature , of ra@@ w nature ."
"And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a lar@@ ger thing or of a lar@@ ger global e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m ."
"And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could contin@@ ue doing this job ."
It would be just too de@@ pre@@ ss@@ ing .
"C@@ A : Well , En@@ ri@@ c , than@@ k you so much for shar@@ ing some of that spi@@ rit@@ ual experience with us all . Thank you ."
E@@ S : Thank you very much .
"So it &apos;s 199@@ 5 , I &apos;m in colle@@ ge , and a friend and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from Pro@@ vi@@ dence , R@@ ho@@ de Is@@ land to P@@ or@@ t@@ land , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and u@@ ne@@ m@@ ploy@@ ed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ ad@@ s through state par@@ ks and national for@@ es@@ ts — basically the lon@@ gest ro@@ u@@ te we can possi@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of S@@ outh D@@ ak@@ ota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 mil@@ es ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter I keep seeing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
My friend looks at me to@@ tally b@@ lan@@ kly .
There &apos;s actually a gen@@ t@@ le@@ man in the front row who &apos;s doing a per@@ fect im@@ it@@ ation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sig@@ ns we keep seeing with the Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few mo@@ ments , and then she cra@@ cks up , because she figu@@ res out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) Right , the f@@ am@@ ous Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter for pic@@ ni@@ c area . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about sit@@ u@@ ations exactly like this — why we sometimes mis@@ understand the sig@@ ns around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ ris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might str@@ ike you as a str@@ an@@ ge care@@ er move , but it actually has one great advan@@ ta@@ ge : no job compe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ o@@ id thinking about being wrong , or at least to av@@ o@@ id thinking about the possi@@ bility that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ stra@@ ct .
We all know everybody in this room makes mis@@ takes .
"The human species , in gener@@ al , is fal@@ li@@ ble — o@@ kay fin@@ e ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beli@@ ef@@ s I hold , here in the present ten@@ se , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly all of this ab@@ stra@@ ct ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of fal@@ li@@ bility goes out the win@@ do@@ w — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the present ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ e@@ tin@@ gs in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family v@@ ac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and v@@ ote in the present ten@@ se .
"So effe@@ c@@ tively , we all kind of win@@ d up tra@@ vel@@ ing through life , trap@@ ped in this little bu@@ b@@ ble of feel@@ ing very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individu@@ als , in our person@@ al and pro@@ fes@@ sion@@ al lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us colle@@ c@@ tively as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to con@@ vin@@ ce you that it is possible to step outside of that feel@@ ing and that if you can do so , it is the single gre@@ a@@ test mor@@ al , intel@@ le@@ c@@ tual and crea@@ tive le@@ ap you can make ."
So why do we get stu@@ ck in this feel@@ ing of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feel@@ ing of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emo@@ tion@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ bs down .
"E@@ m@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing . Okay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ um@@ bs down , em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing — than@@ k you , these are great ans@@ wers , but they &apos;re ans@@ wers to a different question ."
You guys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ al@@ iz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be de@@ vas@@ ta@@ ting , it can be re@@ vel@@ a@@ tory , it can actually be quite fun@@ n@@ y , like my stu@@ pi@@ d Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter mis@@ take ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an anal@@ og@@ y .
D@@ o you remember that Lo@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic c@@ oy@@ ote who &apos;s always chas@@ ing and never c@@ at@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every epis@@ o@@ de of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the c@@ oy@@ ote is chas@@ ing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a cli@@ ff , which is fin@@ e — he &apos;s a b@@ ird , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the c@@ oy@@ ote run@@ s off the cli@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ n@@ y — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the c@@ oy@@ ote &apos;s to@@ tally fin@@ e too .
He just ke@@ ep@@ s run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and real@@ iz@@ es that he &apos;s in mi@@ d-@@ air .
That &apos;s when he f@@ alls .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that c@@ oy@@ ote after he &apos;s gone off the cli@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in tro@@ u@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ re@@ ct something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feel@@ s like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tural reason , why we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r blin@@ d@@ ness .
"M@@ os@@ t of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ n@@ al cu@@ e to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing as well — and this one is cul@@ tural .
Th@@ in@@ k back for a moment to ele@@ men@@ tar@@ y school .
"You &apos;re sitting there in clas@@ s , and your teach@@ er is h@@ an@@ ding back qui@@ z pap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not min@@ e , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the ki@@ d who got this pap@@ er ."
"It &apos;s the du@@ m@@ b ki@@ d , the tro@@ u@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er , the one who never does his ho@@ me@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ z@@ y , ir@@ respon@@ si@@ ble di@@ m@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to suc@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any mis@@ takes ."
We learn these really bad le@@ ss@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I su@@ spe@@ ct , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just be@@ coming per@@ fect little A students , per@@ fe@@ c@@ tion@@ is@@ ts , over@@ -@@ ach@@ i@@ e@@ ver@@ s ."
"@@ Right , M@@ r. C@@ F@@ O , as@@ tro@@ physi@@ c@@ ist , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ ath@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , as@@ tro@@ physi@@ c@@ is@@ ts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ ath@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so fin@@ e ."
Ex@@ cept that then we fre@@ ak out at the possi@@ bility that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ sis@@ t that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smar@@ t and respon@@ si@@ ble and vir@@ tu@@ ous and saf@@ e ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Be@@ th Isra@@ el De@@ ac@@ on@@ ess Me@@ di@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter for a sur@@ ger@@ y ."
Be@@ th Isra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ ton .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing hos@@ p@@ ital for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best hos@@ p@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"She &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ tiz@@ ed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ches her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the reco@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing see@@ ms to have gone fin@@ e .
"And she w@@ akes up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in b@@ and@@ ages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in b@@ and@@ ages because the sur@@ ge@@ on has perfor@@ med a maj@@ or oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the v@@ ice pre@@ si@@ dent for health care qu@@ ality at Be@@ th Isra@@ el spo@@ ke about this in@@ ci@@ dent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or whatever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply felt that he was on the cor@@ re@@ ct side of the pati@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tr@@ us@@ ting too much in the feel@@ ing of being on the cor@@ re@@ ct side of anything can be very dang@@ er@@ ous ."
This inter@@ n@@ al sense of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a reli@@ able gu@@ i@@ de to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ing the possi@@ bility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like du@@ m@@ ping 200 million g@@ all@@ ons of o@@ il into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or tor@@ pe@@ doing the global economy ."
So this is a huge prac@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Th@@ in@@ k for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beli@@ ef@@ s just per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly re@@ fle@@ ct reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to expl@@ ain all of those people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us expl@@ ain those people the same way , by res@@ or@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ."
The first thing we usu@@ ally do when someone dis@@ ag@@ re@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ig@@ nor@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still dis@@ ag@@ ree with us , then we move on to a second as@@ sum@@ ption , which is that they &apos;re idi@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right pie@@ ces of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and they are too mo@@ ron@@ ic to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty smar@@ t , then we move on to a third as@@ sum@@ ption : they know the tru@@ th , and they are deli@@ ber@@ a@@ tely dis@@ tor@@ ting it for their own mal@@ evol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a ca@@ tas@@ tro@@ p@@ he .
This at@@ tach@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ke@@ ep@@ s us from pre@@ ven@@ ting mis@@ takes when we absolu@@ tely need to and cau@@ ses us to tre@@ at each other terri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most b@@ af@@ f@@ ling and most tra@@ gic about this is that it m@@ iss@@ es the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly trans@@ l@@ uc@@ ent win@@ do@@ ws and we just g@@ az@@ e out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to g@@ az@@ e out of the same win@@ do@@ w and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The mi@@ ra@@ cle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ tes said his f@@ am@@ ous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , S@@ t@@ . Au@@ g@@ us@@ tin@@ e , s@@ at down and w@@ ro@@ te &quot; &quot; F@@ allo@@ r ergo su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"Au@@ g@@ us@@ tin@@ e under@@ sto@@ od that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing de@@ fect in the human system , something we can er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate or over@@ come ."
It &apos;s to@@ tally fun@@ da@@ mental to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other animals , we are ob@@ se@@ s@@ sed with trying to figure it out ."
"To me , this ob@@ se@@ s@@ sion is the sour@@ ce and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ tivity and crea@@ tivity ."
"L@@ ast year , for vari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found myself lis@@ ten@@ ing to a lot of epis@@ o@@ des of the P@@ u@@ b@@ lic R@@ a@@ dio show This American Li@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m lis@@ ten@@ ing and I &apos;m lis@@ ten@@ ing , and at some point , I start feel@@ ing like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the cra@@ z@@ y w@@ ron@@ g@@ ness la@@ dy .
"I just ima@@ gin@@ ed it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ ra G@@ las@@ s , who &apos;s the hos@@ t of the show ."
"And I men@@ tion@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a sta@@ ff , we jo@@ ke that every single epis@@ o@@ de of our show has the same c@@ ry@@ pto@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the c@@ ry@@ pto@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra G@@ las@@ s , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mo@@ ments of surpris@@ e and re@@ vers@@ al and w@@ ron@@ g@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , au@@ dience mem@@ bers , as lis@@ ten@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot tw@@ is@@ ts and red her@@ rin@@ gs and surpris@@ e en@@ din@@ gs .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h thought he was going to inv@@ ad@@ e I@@ ra@@ q , find a b@@ un@@ ch of we@@ apo@@ ns of mas@@ s de@@ struc@@ tion , li@@ ber@@ ate the people and bring democra@@ cy to the M@@ id@@ d@@ le E@@ ast ."
And something else happened instead .
"And H@@ os@@ n@@ i Mu@@ bar@@ ak thought he was going to be the dic@@ ta@@ tor of E@@ gy@@ pt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too si@@ ck and could pas@@ s the re@@ ig@@ ns of power on@@ to his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ we@@ e@@ the@@ art and move back to your ho@@ meto@@ wn and ra@@ ise a b@@ un@@ ch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was wri@@ ting an incredi@@ bly ner@@ dy book about a sub@@ ject everybody ha@@ tes for an au@@ dience that would never materi@@ al@@ ize .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredi@@ ble stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and as@@ ton@@ is@@ h@@ es us ."
"N@@ o off@@ en@@ se , but this entire con@@ fer@@ ence is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ u@@ ment to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just spent an entire week talking about innov@@ ations and advan@@ ce@@ ments and impro@@ ve@@ ments , but you know why we need all of those innov@@ ations and advan@@ ce@@ ments and impro@@ ve@@ ments ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d-@@ bo@@ g@@ g@@ ling and wor@@ l@@ d-@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TED 199@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) D@@ id@@ n &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"Wh@@ ere &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ack , Ch@@ ris ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disco@@ ver won@@ der , you need to step outside of that tin@@ y , terri@@ fi@@ ed space of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the vas@@ t@@ ness and comple@@ x@@ ity and my@@ ster@@ y of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
M@@ ay@@ be I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

N@@ os@@ air would ev@@ en@@ tually be con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted for his invol@@ ve@@ ment in the p@@ lot .
E@@ l@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air is my father .
It wasn &apos;t until I was seven years old that our family dy@@ na@@ mic started to change .
"A few months pri@@ or to his ar@@ rest , he s@@ at me down and expl@@ ain@@ ed that for the past few we@@ ek@@ ends , he and some friends had been going to a sho@@ o@@ ting ran@@ ge on Lon@@ g Is@@ land for tar@@ get prac@@ tice ."
He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next mor@@ ning .
"My un@@ cle turned to the other men , and in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c said , &quot; &quot; I@@ b@@ n ab@@ u@@ h . &quot; &quot; L@@ ike father , like son ."
"They all see@@ med to get a really big lau@@ gh out of that com@@ ment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully under@@ sto@@ od what they thought was so fun@@ n@@ y ."
They thought they saw in me the same de@@ struc@@ tion my father was cap@@ able of .
"Th@@ ose men would ev@@ en@@ tually be con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted of plac@@ ing a v@@ an fil@@ led with 1@@ ,@@ 500 po@@ un@@ ds of ex@@ plo@@ si@@ ves into the sub@@ -@@ level par@@ king lot of the Wor@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter &apos;s Nor@@ th T@@ o@@ wer , cau@@ sing an ex@@ plo@@ sion that kil@@ led six people and in@@ ju@@ red over 1@@ ,000 others ."
These were the men I looked up to .
"Th@@ ese were the men I called am@@ m@@ u , which means un@@ cle ."
"E@@ ach time I would beg@@ in to feel com@@ for@@ table around someone , it was time to p@@ ack up and move to the next to@@ wn ."
"B@@ e@@ ing the per@@ pe@@ tual new face in clas@@ s , I was fre@@ qu@@ ently the tar@@ get of bu@@ l@@ lies ."
So what open@@ ed my eyes ?
One of my first experi@@ ences that chall@@ eng@@ ed this way of thinking was during the 2@@ 000 pre@@ si@@ den@@ tial elec@@ tions .
"One day to@@ ward the end of the con@@ ven@@ tion , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ en@@ ded was J@@ e@@ w@@ ish ."
"A@@ no@@ ther maj@@ or tur@@ ning point came when I found a sum@@ mer job at B@@ us@@ ch G@@ ar@@ den@@ s , an am@@ u@@ se@@ ment par@@ k ."
"There , I was ex@@ posed to people from all sor@@ ts of fai@@ ths and cul@@ tures , and that experience pro@@ ved to be fun@@ da@@ mental to the develo@@ pment of my charac@@ ter ."
"Because of that feel@@ ing , I was able to con@@ tr@@ ast the ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es I &apos;d been tau@@ ght as a child with real life experience and inter@@ action ."
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in des@@ per@@ ate need of one .
"In that in@@ st@@ ant , I realized how much ne@@ ga@@ tive energy it takes to hold that ha@@ tre@@ d inside of you ."
Z@@ ak E@@ bra@@ him is not my real name .
So why would I out myself and poten@@ ti@@ ally put myself in dang@@ er ?
"Well , that &apos;s simple ."
"In@@ stead , I cho@@ ose to use my experience to fi@@ ght back against ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m , against the big@@ ot@@ ry ."
"For the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m , I will speak out against these sen@@ se@@ less ac@@ ts and con@@ de@@ m@@ n my father &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"And with that simple fact , I stand here as pro@@ of that violence isn &apos;t in@@ her@@ ent in one &apos;s reli@@ gion or ra@@ ce , and the son does not have to fol@@ low the ways of his father ."
I am not my father .
"Th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks a lot . ( Applause )"
I &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to be here .
"I &apos;m hon@@ or@@ ed by the inv@@ it@@ ation , and than@@ ks ."
"I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but un@@ for@@ tu@@ na@@ tely , I su@@ spe@@ ct that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t inter@@ est many other people ."
"( Laughter ) It would be just as much fu@@ n to talk about some stuff that happened in 19@@ 8@@ 6 and 19@@ 8@@ 7 , when a computer h@@ ac@@ ker is bre@@ aking into our systems over at L@@ aw@@ r@@ ence B@@ er@@ ke@@ le@@ y L@@ ab@@ s ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"A third time , it &apos;s just being a techn@@ ic@@ ian ."
"I &apos;m a scienti@@ st . O@@ n@@ ce I do something , I do something else ."
"So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that ."
"N@@ or am I going to talk about what I think are obvi@@ ous sta@@ te@@ ments from my first book , &quot; &quot; S@@ ili@@ c@@ on S@@ n@@ ake O@@ il , &quot; &quot; or my second book , no@@ r am I going to talk about why I believe compu@@ ters don &apos;t be@@ long in scho@@ ols ."
I feel that there &apos;s a mas@@ sive and b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re idea going around that we have to bring more compu@@ ters into scho@@ ols .
My idea is : no ! No !
"G@@ et them out of scho@@ ols , and keep them out of scho@@ ols ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the argu@@ ment is so obvi@@ ous to any@@ one who &apos;s hun@@ g around a f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de clas@@ s@@ room that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I gu@@ ess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said ."
So don &apos;t go back and read my dis@@ ser@@ tation .
It probably has lies in it as well .
"H@@ av@@ ing said that , I out@@ lin@@ ed my talk about five minutes ago ."
"( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the ma@@ in thing I w@@ ro@@ te on my th@@ um@@ b was the future ."
"I &apos;m sup@@ posed to talk about the future , y@@ es ?"
No ! D@@ on &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s wri@@ ting co@@ de .
They know .
"In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten teach@@ er , ask an experi@@ en@@ ced one ."
They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another gener@@ ation .
"I don &apos;t . N@@ or , I su@@ spe@@ ct , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring ."
"C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly , all of us can imagine these co@@ ol new things that are going to be there ."

"@@ Ch@@ an@@ ge is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in so@@ f@@ tw@@ are ."
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
"I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fu@@ n , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?"
Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
I@@ s that visi@@ ble ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is on@@ e-@@ si@@ ded things .
I would de@@ ar@@ ly love to talk about things that have one side .
"Because I love Mo@@ bi@@ us loo@@ ps . I not only love Mo@@ bi@@ us loo@@ ps , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les ."
"@@ Right away , I hope that all of your eyes g@@ la@@ ze over ."
This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle .
"For those of you in the au@@ dience who know , you ro@@ ll your eyes and say , y@@ up , I know all about it ."
It &apos;s one si@@ ded . It &apos;s a bot@@ tle wh@@ ose inside is its outside .

It has wonderful pro@@ per@@ ties .
"If you take two Mo@@ bi@@ us loo@@ ps and se@@ w their common ed@@ ge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of g@@ las@@ s ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : I &apos;ve got a col@@ d . ) H@@ ow@@ ever , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stan@@ ds for design ."

"And because our universe is only three s@@ pati@@ al di@@ men@@ sions , it can hold flu@@ i@@ ds ."
So it &apos;s high@@ ly — that one &apos;s the co@@ ol one .

"( H@@ i@@ gh@@ -@@ p@@ it@@ ched ton@@ e ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three we@@ eks ago in my clas@@ s — this is through the len@@ s , and one of the things we used a len@@ s for was to measu@@ re the spe@@ ed of light ."
"My students in E@@ l C@@ er@@ ri@@ to — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very be@@ at up os@@ c@@ il@@ lo@@ s@@ co@@ pe — measu@@ red the spe@@ ed of light ."
We were off by 25 percent . How many eigh@@ th gra@@ ders do you know of who have measu@@ red the spe@@ ed of light ?
"In ad@@ di@@ tion to that , we &apos;ve measu@@ red the spe@@ ed of sound ."
I &apos;d love to measu@@ re the spe@@ ed of light here .

"And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !"
And there &apos;s no time to do it .
"So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measu@@ re the spe@@ ed of light !"
"But me@@ an@@ while , let &apos;s measu@@ re the spe@@ ed of sound !"
"Well , the obvi@@ ous way to measu@@ re the spe@@ ed of sound is to b@@ oun@@ ce sound off something and look at the echo ."
"But , probably — one of my students , A@@ ri@@ el &#91; un@@ cle@@ ar &#93; , said , &quot; C@@ ould we measu@@ re the spe@@ ed of light using the wa@@ ve equ@@ ation ? &quot;"
And all of you know the wa@@ ve equ@@ ation is the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy times the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of any wa@@ ve ...
"@@ is a con@@ st@@ ant . Wh@@ en the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy goes up , the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th comes down . W@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th goes up , fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy goes down .

Right ? This is simple physi@@ cs .

"What they didn &apos;t tell you in physi@@ cs — in eigh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ de physi@@ cs — but they should have , and I w@@ ish they had , was that if you mul@@ ti@@ ply the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy times the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of sound or light , you get a con@@ st@@ ant ."
And that con@@ st@@ ant is the spe@@ ed of sound .
"So , in order to measu@@ re the spe@@ ed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy . Well , that &apos;s easy ."
I &apos;ve got a fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy coun@@ ter right here .

It &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 ki@@ lo@@ her@@ t@@ z . I measu@@ re its w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th .

"A@@ t that moment , I started thinking ."
It made me ma@@ d .
It defin@@ i@@ tely hu@@ r@@ ts !
I &apos;m den@@ i@@ ed the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
Wh@@ ere could this happen ?
How did we get here ?
"Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would re@@ ach a sta@@ ge in their lives , where they invol@@ un@@ tar@@ i@@ ly give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re mo@@ der@@ n and civi@@ liz@@ ed ."
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get all my culture , thou@@ ghts , intel@@ le@@ ct and all my memor@@ ies ?"
Ch@@ il@@ d@@ ho@@ od stories might be the best memor@@ ies we have of the war !
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get everything I learned in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c , just to con@@ form ?"
To be one of them ?
Wh@@ ere &apos;s the lo@@ gic in that ?
"D@@ es@@ p@@ ite all that , I tried to understand him ."
I didn &apos;t want to ju@@ dge him with the same c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty that he ju@@ d@@ ged me .
The A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language doesn &apos;t sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y today &apos;s needs .
"It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties , a language we use in the wor@@ k@@ place , a language we re@@ ly on if we were to per@@ form an advan@@ ced research project , and it defin@@ i@@ tely isn &apos;t a language we use at the air@@ port ."
"If we did so , they &apos;d stri@@ p us of our clo@@ thes ."
"Wh@@ ere can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !"
"So , you want us to use A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c . Wh@@ ere are we to do so ?"
This is one reality .
But we have another more important reality that we ou@@ ght to think about .
A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c is the mother ton@@ gu@@ e .
Re@@ se@@ arch says that mas@@ ter@@ y of other langu@@ ages de@@ man@@ ds mas@@ ter@@ y of the mother ton@@ gu@@ e .
M@@ as@@ ter@@ y of the mother ton@@ gu@@ e is a p@@ r@@ ere@@ qu@@ is@@ ite for crea@@ tive ex@@ pres@@ sion in other langu@@ ages .
How ?
"Gi@@ b@@ ran K@@ h@@ ali@@ l Gi@@ b@@ ran , when he first started wri@@ ting , he used A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ."
"A@@ ll his ideas , ima@@ gin@@ ation and ph@@ i@@ loso@@ ph@@ y were inspi@@ red by this little bo@@ y in the v@@ ill@@ age where he gre@@ w up , s@@ mel@@ ling a speci@@ fic s@@ me@@ ll , hear@@ ing a speci@@ fic voice , and thinking a speci@@ fic thought ."
"So , when he started wri@@ ting in Eng@@ lish , he had enough b@@ ag@@ g@@ age ."
"E@@ ven when he w@@ ro@@ te in Eng@@ lish , when you read his wri@@ tin@@ gs in Eng@@ lish , you s@@ me@@ ll the same s@@ me@@ ll , sense the same feel@@ ing ."
"You can imagine that that &apos;s him wri@@ ting in Eng@@ lish , the same bo@@ y who came from the m@@ oun@@ tain . F@@ ro@@ m a v@@ ill@@ age on M@@ oun@@ t L@@ eb@@ an@@ on ."
"So , this is an example no one can argu@@ e with ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , it &apos;s often said that if you want to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , the only way to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , is to k@@ ill its language ."
This is a reality that developed socie@@ ties are aw@@ are of .
"The Ger@@ man@@ s , F@@ ren@@ ch , J@@ apan@@ ese and Ch@@ in@@ ese , all these na@@ tions are aw@@ are of this ."
That &apos;s why they leg@@ is@@ late to prote@@ ct their language .
They make it s@@ ac@@ red .
"That &apos;s why they use it in produc@@ tion , they p@@ ay a lot of money to develo@@ p it ."
D@@ o we know better than them ?
"A@@ ll right , we ar@@ en &apos;t from the developed world , this advan@@ ced thinking h@@ as@@ n &apos;t re@@ ach@@ ed us yet , and we would like to c@@ at@@ ch up with the civi@@ liz@@ ed world ."
"C@@ oun@@ tries that were once like us , but decided to stri@@ ve for develo@@ pment , do research , and c@@ at@@ ch up with those countries , such as T@@ ur@@ key , M@@ al@@ ay@@ sia and others , they car@@ ried their language with them as they were cli@@ m@@ b@@ ing the la@@ d@@ der , prote@@ cted it like a dia@@ mon@@ d ."
They kep@@ t it close to them .
"Because if you get any produc@@ t from T@@ ur@@ key or el@@ se@@ where and it &apos;s not la@@ be@@ led in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , then it isn &apos;t a local produc@@ t ."
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local produc@@ t .
"They &apos;d go back to being con@@ su@@ mers , clu@@ ele@@ ss con@@ su@@ mers , like we are most of the time ."
"So , in order for them to innov@@ ate and pro@@ duce , they had to prote@@ ct their language ."
"If I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty , in@@ depen@@ dence ( A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ) , &quot; &quot; what does this re@@ mind you of ?"
"It doesn &apos;t ring a be@@ ll , does it ?"
"@@ R@@ eg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the who , how and why ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t just for con@@ vers@@ ing , just words coming out of our m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age re@@ presen@@ ts speci@@ fic sta@@ ges in our lives , and ter@@ min@@ o@@ logy that is lin@@ ked to our emo@@ tions ."
"So when we say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty , in@@ depen@@ dence , &quot; &quot; each one of you dra@@ ws a speci@@ fic image in their own mind , there are speci@@ fic feel@@ ings of a speci@@ fic day in a speci@@ fic h@@ isto@@ ri@@ cal peri@@ od ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t one , two or three words or le@@ t@@ ters put together ."
"It &apos;s an idea inside that rela@@ tes to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us ."
What is our intel@@ le@@ ct ?
How do you say whether this guy under@@ stan@@ ds or not ?
"So , if I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty , in@@ depen@@ dence ( Eng@@ lish ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; D@@ ad , have you li@@ ved through the peri@@ od of the fre@@ e@@ dom ( Eng@@ lish ) s@@ log@@ an ? &quot;"
How would you feel ?
"If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in v@@ ain ."
The idea is that these ex@@ pres@@ sions re@@ mind us of a speci@@ fic thing .
I have a f@@ ran@@ co@@ phone friend who &apos;s mar@@ ried to a F@@ ren@@ ch man .
I asked her once how things were going .
"She said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing is fin@@ e , but once , I spent a whole night as@@ king and trying to trans@@ late the me@@ an@@ ing of the word &apos; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The po@@ or woman had mis@@ tak@@ en@@ ly told him &quot; &quot; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to expl@@ ain it to him ."
He was pu@@ z@@ z@@ led by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could any@@ one be this c@@ ru@@ el ?
D@@ o@@ es she want to comm@@ it su@@ ic@@ i@@ de ?
&apos;@@ B@@ u@@ ry me ? &apos; ( Eng@@ lish ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few exam@@ ples .
"It made us feel that she &apos;s un@@ able to tell that word to her h@@ us@@ b@@ and , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different ."
"She said to me , &quot; &quot; He lis@@ ten@@ s to F@@ ai@@ ru@@ z with me , and one night , I tried to trans@@ late for him so he can feel what I feel when I lis@@ ten to F@@ ai@@ ru@@ z . &quot; &quot; The po@@ or woman tried to trans@@ late this for him : &quot; F@@ ro@@ m them I ex@@ ten@@ ded my hands and sto@@ le you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pic@@ k@@ le : &quot; And because you be@@ long to them , I re@@ turned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )"
T@@ ran@@ s@@ late that for me .
"( Applause ) So , what have we done to prote@@ ct the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language ?"
"We turned this into a con@@ cer@@ n of the civi@@ l society , and we lau@@ n@@ ched a cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n to pre@@ ser@@ ve the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language ."
"E@@ ven though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bo@@ ther ?"
For@@ get about this head@@ ach@@ e and go have fu@@ n . &quot; &quot; No problem !
"The cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n to pre@@ ser@@ ve A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c lau@@ n@@ ched a s@@ log@@ an that says , &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ ply from the W@@ est . &quot;"
"We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not ac@@ cept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t a@@ do@@ pt this st@@ y@@ le because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be under@@ sto@@ od ."
"And when someone tal@@ ks to me that way , I ha@@ te the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language ."
"We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be con@@ vin@@ ced in a way that re@@ fle@@ cts our dre@@ am@@ s , as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions and da@@ y@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day life ."
In a way that dre@@ s@@ ses like us and thin@@ ks like we do .
"So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ ply from the W@@ est &quot; &quot; has h@@ it the spo@@ t ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very easy , yet crea@@ tive and per@@ su@@ as@@ i@@ ve ."
"A@@ f@@ ter that , we lau@@ n@@ ched another cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n with s@@ cen@@ es of le@@ t@@ ters on the ground ."
"You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a s@@ cen@@ e of a le@@ tter sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by black and y@@ el@@ low tap@@ e with &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t k@@ ill your language ! &quot; &quot; w@@ rit@@ ten on it ."
"Wh@@ y ? S@@ eri@@ ously , don &apos;t k@@ ill your language ."
We really sh@@ ouldn &apos;t k@@ ill our language .
"If we were to k@@ ill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identi@@ ty ."
We &apos;d have to find an exis@@ t@@ ence .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
This is be@@ y@@ ond just m@@ iss@@ ing our chan@@ ce of being mo@@ der@@ n and civi@@ liz@@ ed .
Af@@ ter that we rele@@ as@@ ed pho@@ tos of guys and gir@@ ls w@@ ear@@ ing the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c le@@ tter .
P@@ ho@@ tos of &quot; &quot; co@@ ol &quot; &quot; guys and gir@@ ls .
We are very co@@ ol !
"And to wh@@ o@@ ever might say , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ! You used an Eng@@ lish word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I a@@ do@@ pt the word &apos; co@@ ol . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them ob@@ ject ho@@ w@@ ever they want , but give me a word that &apos;s n@@ ic@@ er and mat@@ ches the reality better ."
I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wi@@ de we@@ b &quot; &quot; ( L@@ augh@@ s ) Because it doesn &apos;t f@@ it ! We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t ki@@ d ourselves .

C@@ re@@ a@@ tivity is the idea .
"So , if we can &apos;t re@@ ach space or build a ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t and so on , we can be crea@@ tive ."
"A@@ t this moment , every one of you is a crea@@ tive project ."
C@@ re@@ a@@ tivity in your mother ton@@ gu@@ e is the pa@@ th .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
Let &apos;s write a no@@ vel or pro@@ duce a shor@@ t film .
A single no@@ vel could make us global again .
It could bring the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language back to being number one .
"So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !"
"But we have to know that , and be con@@ vin@@ ced that a solution exis@@ ts , that we have a du@@ ty to be part of that solution ."
"In con@@ clu@@ sion , what can you do today ?"
"Now , twe@@ ets , who &apos;s twe@@ e@@ ting ?"
"P@@ le@@ ase , I be@@ g of you , even though my time has fin@@ is@@ hed , either A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c , Eng@@ lish , F@@ ren@@ ch or Ch@@ in@@ ese ."
But don &apos;t write A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c with La@@ tin charac@@ ters mi@@ x@@ ed with numbers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a dis@@ as@@ ter ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be en@@ ter@@ ing a vir@@ tual world with a vir@@ tual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and ris@@ e .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
"S@@ econ@@ d , there are many other things that we can do ."
We &apos;re not here today to con@@ vin@@ ce each other .
We &apos;re here to bring atten@@ tion to the ne@@ cess@@ ity of pre@@ ser@@ ving this language .
Now I will tell you a se@@ cre@@ t .
A bab@@ y first identi@@ fi@@ es its father through language .
"When my d@@ aughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , hon@@ ey ( A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your d@@ ad , hon@@ ey ( Eng@@ lish ) . &quot; &quot; And in the super@@ market , I pro@@ mis@@ e my d@@ aughter No@@ or , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ ks ( A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; D@@ is , &apos; M@@ er@@ c@@ i , Ma@@ man , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her ."
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get ri@@ d of this cul@@ tural c@@ rin@@ ge . ( Applause )
"S@@ us@@ tain@@ ability re@@ presen@@ ts the what , the where and the how of what is cau@@ ght ."
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my din@@ ner cho@@ ices .
I want to know how I imp@@ act them .
I want to know how they imp@@ act me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they re@@ ly on the water &apos;s b@@ oun@@ ty for their living .
U@@ n@@ der@@ standing all of this en@@ ab@@ les us to shi@@ ft our per@@ cep@@ tion of se@@ af@@ o@@ od away from a com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity to an opportunity to re@@ sto@@ re our e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m .
It allo@@ ws for us to c@@ ele@@ bra@@ te the se@@ af@@ o@@ od that we &apos;re also so for@@ tun@@ ate to e@@ at .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it re@@ sto@@ ra@@ tive se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
"Wh@@ ere susta@@ in@@ ability is the cap@@ ac@@ ity to en@@ du@@ re and main@@ tain , re@@ sto@@ ra@@ tive is the ability to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish and pro@@ gre@@ ss ."
"@@ R@@ es@@ to@@ ra@@ tive se@@ af@@ o@@ od allo@@ ws for an evol@@ ving and dy@@ na@@ mic system and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges our relation@@ ship with the oc@@ ean as a resour@@ ce , sug@@ g@@ es@@ ting that we eng@@ age to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the oc@@ ean and to en@@ cou@@ rag@@ e its re@@ si@@ li@@ en@@ cy ."
"It is a more ho@@ pe@@ ful , it is a more human , and is a more u@@ se@@ ful way of under@@ standing our environment ."
W@@ al@@ let gu@@ ides — stan@@ d@@ ard issu@@ e by lots in the mar@@ ine con@@ serv@@ ation world — are very h@@ an@@ dy ; they &apos;re a wonderful to@@ ol .
"G@@ re@@ en , y@@ el@@ low and red lis@@ ts &#91; of &#93; se@@ af@@ o@@ od species ."
"The as@@ soci@@ ation is very easy : bu@@ y green , don &apos;t bu@@ y red , think tw@@ ice about y@@ el@@ low ."
"But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just e@@ at green lis@@ t ."
We can &apos;t susta@@ in this without the measu@@ re of our suc@@ cess really chan@@ ging the f@@ ate of the species in the y@@ el@@ low and the red .
But what if we e@@ at only in the green lis@@ t ?
You &apos;ve got po@@ le@@ -@@ cau@@ ght y@@ el@@ lo@@ w@@ f@@ in tu@@ na here — comes from susta@@ in@@ able sto@@ cks .
P@@ ole cau@@ ght — no by@@ c@@ at@@ ch .
Gre@@ at for fis@@ her@@ men . L@@ ots of money . S@@ up@@ por@@ ting local econom@@ ies .
But it &apos;s a lion of the se@@ a . It &apos;s a top pre@@ da@@ tor .
What &apos;s the con@@ text of this me@@ al ?
A@@ m I sitting down in a ste@@ ak@@ house to a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of this ?
D@@ o I do this three times a week ?
"I might still be in the green lis@@ t , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oc@@ e@@ ans any fav@@ ors ."
"The point is that we have to have a con@@ text , a g@@ au@@ ge for our ac@@ tions in all this ."
Ex@@ am@@ ple : I &apos;ve heard that red w@@ ine is great for my health — anti@@ ox@@ id@@ an@@ ts and min@@ er@@ als — heart heal@@ th@@ y .
That &apos;s great ! I love red w@@ ine !
I &apos;m going to d@@ rin@@ k so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so heal@@ th@@ y .
"Well , how many bot@@ t@@ les is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?"
"Well fol@@ ks , we have a prote@@ in problem ."
"We have lost this sen@@ si@@ bility when it re@@ gar@@ ds our food , and we are pa@@ ying a cost ."
The problem is we are h@@ id@@ ing that cost ben@@ e@@ ath the w@@ av@@ es .
We are h@@ id@@ ing that cost behind the social ac@@ cep@@ tance of ex@@ pan@@ ding wa@@ is@@ t@@ lin@@ es .
And we are h@@ id@@ ing that cost behind mon@@ s@@ ter pro@@ f@@ its .
So the first thing about this idea of re@@ sto@@ ra@@ tive se@@ af@@ o@@ od is that it really takes into ac@@ coun@@ t our needs .
"@@ R@@ es@@ to@@ ra@@ tive se@@ af@@ o@@ od might best be re@@ presen@@ ted not by J@@ a@@ ws , or by F@@ li@@ p@@ per , or the G@@ or@@ don &apos;s fis@@ her@@ man , but rather , by the J@@ ol@@ ly Gre@@ en Gi@@ ant ."
V@@ e@@ ge@@ tab@@ les : they might yet sa@@ ve the oc@@ e@@ ans .
S@@ y@@ l@@ via lik@@ es to say that blu@@ e is the new green .
Well I &apos;d like to re@@ spe@@ c@@ t@@ fully sub@@ m@@ it that bro@@ c@@ col@@ i green might then be the new blu@@ e .
"We must contin@@ ue to e@@ at the best se@@ af@@ o@@ od possible , if at all ."
But we also must e@@ at it with a ton of ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les .
The best part about re@@ sto@@ ra@@ tive se@@ af@@ o@@ od though is that it comes on the hal@@ f-@@ sh@@ ell with a bot@@ tle of T@@ ab@@ as@@ c@@ o and le@@ mon we@@ d@@ ges .
"It comes in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of ti@@ lap@@ ia bre@@ a@@ ded with Di@@ j@@ on mus@@ tar@@ d and c@@ ris@@ py , bro@@ i@@ led b@@ read@@ c@@ ru@@ m@@ bs and a ste@@ am@@ ing p@@ ile of pe@@ can qu@@ in@@ o@@ a p@@ il@@ a@@ f with c@@ run@@ ch@@ y , gri@@ l@@ led bro@@ c@@ col@@ i so so@@ ft and s@@ we@@ et and char@@ red and s@@ mo@@ k@@ y on the outside with just a h@@ in@@ t of chil@@ i fl@@ ake ."
W@@ ho@@ o@@ o !
This is an easy se@@ ll .
And the best part is all of those in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents are av@@ ail@@ able to every family at the n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od W@@ al@@ mar@@ t .
J@@ a@@ mi@@ e O@@ li@@ ver is cam@@ pai@@ g@@ ning to sa@@ ve America from the way we e@@ at .
S@@ y@@ l@@ via is cam@@ pai@@ g@@ ning to sa@@ ve the oc@@ e@@ ans from the way we e@@ at .
There &apos;s a patter@@ n here .
For@@ get n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar ho@@ lo@@ cau@@ st ; it &apos;s the for@@ k that we have to wor@@ ry about .
We have ra@@ v@@ ag@@ ed our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sour@@ ced to h@@ an@@ dic@@ ap ourselves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole e@@ ating thing wrong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expe@@ ct from our food .
S@@ us@@ tain@@ ability is com@@ plic@@ ated but din@@ ner is a reality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of movement re@@ cen@@ tly in gre@@ en@@ ing our food systems .
D@@ an B@@ ar@@ ber and A@@ li@@ ce W@@ a@@ ters are lead@@ ing pas@@ sion@@ a@@ tely the green food D@@ eli@@ ci@@ ous R@@ evol@@ ution .
But green fo@@ ods often re@@ present a way for us to dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard the respon@@ si@@ bility as e@@ a@@ ters .
Just because it comes from a green sour@@ ce doesn &apos;t mean we can tre@@ at it with dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard on the pl@@ ate .
We have e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly all@@ -@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ e@@ at sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p bu@@ f@@ fe@@ t .
It doesn &apos;t work .
H@@ ear@@ t-@@ heal@@ th@@ y din@@ ner is a very important part of re@@ sto@@ ra@@ tive se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
"Wh@@ ile we try to man@@ age dec@@ lin@@ ing mar@@ ine popu@@ la@@ tions , the media &apos;s re@@ com@@ men@@ ding incre@@ as@@ ed con@@ sum@@ ption of se@@ af@@ o@@ od ."
"S@@ tu@@ dies say that ten@@ s of thousands of American grand@@ mo@@ th@@ ers , grand@@ f@@ ath@@ ers , mo@@ th@@ ers and f@@ ath@@ ers might be around for another bir@@ th@@ day if we inclu@@ ded more se@@ af@@ o@@ od ."
That &apos;s a re@@ ward I am not wil@@ ling to pas@@ s up .
But it &apos;s not all about the se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our pl@@ ates .
"As a che@@ f , I realize the eas@@ i@@ est thing for me to do is re@@ duce the por@@ tion si@@ z@@ es on my pl@@ ate ."
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
"P@@ e@@ ople started bu@@ ying appe@@ tiz@@ ers and sal@@ ad@@ s , because they knew they wer@@ en &apos;t going to f@@ ill up on the en@@ tre@@ es alone ."
"P@@ e@@ ople spent more time eng@@ ag@@ ing in their me@@ als , eng@@ ag@@ ing with each other over their me@@ als ."
"P@@ e@@ ople got , in shor@@ t , more of what they came there for even though they got less prote@@ in ."
They got more cal@@ or@@ ies over the course of a di@@ ver@@ si@@ fi@@ ed me@@ al .
They got heal@@ th@@ i@@ er . I made more money .
This is great .
"En@@ viron@@ mental consi@@ der@@ ation was ser@@ ved with every pl@@ ate , but it was ser@@ ved with a he@@ ap@@ ing m@@ ound of consi@@ der@@ ation for human interes@@ ts at the same time ."
"One of the other things we did was beg@@ in to di@@ ver@@ si@@ f@@ y the species that we ser@@ ved — small sil@@ ver@@ fish , an@@ cho@@ vi@@ es , ma@@ c@@ ker@@ el , s@@ ar@@ din@@ es were un@@ common ."
"S@@ hel@@ l@@ fish , mus@@ sel@@ s , oys@@ ters , c@@ la@@ ms , ti@@ lap@@ ia , ch@@ ar — these were the common species ."
"We were direc@@ ting tas@@ tes to@@ wards more re@@ si@@ li@@ ence , more re@@ sto@@ ra@@ tive op@@ tions ."
This is what we need to fav@@ or .
This is what the green lis@@ t says .
But this is also how we can actually beg@@ in to re@@ sto@@ re our environment .
"But what of those big pre@@ da@@ tors , those fas@@ hi@@ on@@ able species , that green lis@@ t tu@@ na that I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er ?"
"Well , if you must , I have a re@@ ci@@ pe for you ."
"It pretty much works with any big fish in the oc@@ ean , so here we go ."
S@@ tar@@ t with a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of big fish .
G@@ et a k@@ ni@@ fe . C@@ ut it into four por@@ tions .
P@@ ut it on four pl@@ ates .
"M@@ ound up those four pl@@ ates with ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les and then open up the very best bot@@ tle of B@@ u@@ rg@@ un@@ dy you have , light the can@@ d@@ les and c@@ ele@@ bra@@ te it ."
C@@ ele@@ bra@@ te the opportunity you have to e@@ at this .
"In@@ v@@ ite your friends and n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ s over and re@@ pe@@ at once a year , maybe ."
I expe@@ ct a lot from food .
I expe@@ ct health and j@@ oy and family and community .
"I expe@@ ct that produc@@ ing in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents , pre@@ par@@ ing dis@@ h@@ es and e@@ ating me@@ als is all part of the commun@@ ion of human interes@@ ts ."
I was l@@ uc@@ k@@ y enough that my father was a fantas@@ tic co@@ ok .
And he tau@@ ght me very early on about the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge that e@@ ating re@@ presen@@ ts .
I remember well the me@@ als of my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od .
"They were reas@@ on@@ able por@@ tions of prote@@ in ser@@ ved with co@@ pi@@ ous qu@@ anti@@ ties of ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les and small amoun@@ ts of star@@ ch , usu@@ ally ri@@ ce ."
This is still how I lar@@ ge@@ ly e@@ at today .
I get si@@ ck when I go to ste@@ ak@@ h@@ ou@@ ses .
I get the me@@ at s@@ we@@ a@@ ts .
It &apos;s like a h@@ an@@ go@@ ver from prote@@ in .
It &apos;s dis@@ g@@ us@@ ting .
"But of all the di@@ re news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oc@@ e@@ ans , I have the un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate bur@@ den of deli@@ ver@@ ing to you possi@@ bly the very wor@@ st of it and that is this whole time your mother was right ."
E@@ at your ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les .
It &apos;s pretty stra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ forward .
So what are we looking for in a me@@ al ?
"Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wh@@ o@@ le@@ some in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that are good for my body ."
"For j@@ oy , I &apos;m looking for bu@@ tter and sal@@ t and sex@@ y things that make things tas@@ te less like pen@@ ance ."
"For family , I &apos;m looking for re@@ ci@@ pes that gen@@ u@@ fle@@ ct to my own person@@ al h@@ istories ."
"For community though , we start at the very beginning ."
There &apos;s no es@@ cap@@ ing the fact that everything we e@@ at has a global imp@@ act .
So try and learn as best you can what that imp@@ act is and then take the first step to min@@ i@@ miz@@ e it .
"We &apos;ve seen an image of our blu@@ e planet , our world b@@ ank ."
But it is more than just a re@@ posi@@ tory of our resour@@ ces ; it &apos;s also the global ge@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ y of the commun@@ ion we call din@@ ner .
"So if we all take only what we need , then we can beg@@ in to share the rest , we can beg@@ in to c@@ ele@@ bra@@ te , we can beg@@ in to re@@ sto@@ re ."
We need to sav@@ or ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les .
We need to sav@@ or sm@@ al@@ ler por@@ tions of se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
And we need to sa@@ ve din@@ ner .
Thank you .
( Applause )
H@@ i . I am an archite@@ ct .
"I am the only archite@@ ct in the world making buil@@ din@@ gs out of pap@@ er like this car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard tu@@ be , and this ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion is the first one I did using pap@@ er tu@@ bes ."
"@@ 19@@ 8@@ 6 , much , much longer before people started talking about e@@ co@@ log@@ ical issu@@ es and environ@@ mental issu@@ es , I just started tes@@ ting the pap@@ er tu@@ be in order to use this as a building struc@@ ture ."
"It &apos;s very com@@ plic@@ ated to test the new materi@@ al for the building , but this is much st@@ ron@@ ger than I expe@@ cted , and also it &apos;s very easy to wa@@ ter@@ pro@@ of , and also , because it &apos;s indus@@ tri@@ al materi@@ al , it &apos;s also possible to fi@@ re@@ pro@@ of ."
"Th@@ en I built the tem@@ por@@ ary struc@@ ture , 19@@ 90 ."
This is the first tem@@ por@@ ary building made out of pap@@ er .
"There are 3@@ 30 tu@@ bes , dia@@ me@@ ter 5@@ 5 &#91; cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ters &#93; , there are only 12 tu@@ bes with a dia@@ me@@ ter of 1@@ 20 cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ters , or four fe@@ et , wi@@ de ."
"As you see it in the pho@@ to , inside is the to@@ i@@ let ."
"In case you &apos;re fin@@ is@@ hed with to@@ i@@ let pap@@ er , you can te@@ ar off the inside of the w@@ all . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very u@@ se@@ ful ."
"@@ Ye@@ ar 2@@ 000 , there was a big ex@@ po in Ger@@ many ."
"I was asked to design the building , because the the@@ me of the ex@@ po was environ@@ mental issu@@ es ."
"So I was cho@@ se@@ n to build the pa@@ vi@@ lion out of pap@@ er tu@@ bes , rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able pap@@ er ."
My go@@ al of the design is not when it &apos;s comple@@ ted .
"My go@@ al was when the building was demo@@ lis@@ hed , because each country makes a lot of pa@@ vi@@ lions but after half a year , we create a lot of indus@@ tri@@ al was@@ te , so my building has to be re@@ used or rec@@ y@@ c@@ led ."
"A@@ f@@ ter , the building was rec@@ y@@ c@@ led ."
So that was the go@@ al of my design .
Th@@ en I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to w@@ in the compe@@ ti@@ tion to build the second P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in Fran@@ ce in the city of Me@@ t@@ z .
"Because I was so po@@ or , I wanted to r@@ ent an off@@ ice in Par@@ is , but I couldn &apos;t af@@ for@@ d it , so I decided to bring my students to Par@@ is to build our off@@ ice on top of the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in Par@@ is by ourselves ."
So we bro@@ ught the pap@@ er tu@@ bes and the wo@@ o@@ den jo@@ in@@ ts to comple@@ te the 3@@ 5@@ -@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ long off@@ ice .
We sta@@ y@@ ed there for six years without pa@@ ying any r@@ ent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
"Because we were part of the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to bu@@ y a tic@@ ke@@ t to see me ."
That was the problem .
Th@@ en I comple@@ ted the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in Me@@ t@@ z .
"It &apos;s a very popu@@ lar mu@@ se@@ um now , and I created a big mon@@ u@@ ment for the government ."
"But then I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted at my pro@@ fes@@ sion as an archite@@ ct , because we are not hel@@ ping , we are not working for society , but we are working for pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed people , ri@@ ch people , government , develo@@ per@@ s ."
They have money and power .
Th@@ ose are in@@ visi@@ ble .
So they hi@@ re us to vis@@ u@@ al@@ ize their power and money by making mon@@ u@@ mental archite@@ c@@ ture .
"That is our pro@@ fes@@ sion , even h@@ isto@@ ri@@ cally it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same ."
"So I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their h@@ ou@@ ses by natural dis@@ as@@ ters ."
But I must say they are no longer natural dis@@ as@@ ters .
"For example , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ akes never k@@ ill people , but col@@ lap@@ se of the buil@@ din@@ gs k@@ ill people ."
That &apos;s the respon@@ si@@ bility of archite@@ cts .
"Th@@ en people need some tem@@ por@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing , but there are no archite@@ cts working there because we are too bus@@ y working for pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed people ."
"So I thought , even as archite@@ cts , we can be invol@@ ved in the re@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of tem@@ por@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing ."
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in dis@@ as@@ ter are@@ as .
"@@ 199@@ 4 , there was a big dis@@ as@@ ter in R@@ wan@@ da , Africa ."
"T@@ w@@ o tri@@ bes , H@@ u@@ t@@ u and T@@ u@@ tsi , f@@ ou@@ ght each other ."
O@@ ver two million people became re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
"But I was so surpris@@ ed to see the sh@@ el@@ ter , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p organ@@ ized by the U.@@ N@@ ."
"They &apos;re so po@@ or , and they are fre@@ ez@@ ing with b@@ lan@@ ke@@ ts during the ra@@ in@@ y se@@ as@@ on , In the sh@@ el@@ ters built by the U.@@ N@@ . , they were just provi@@ ding a plas@@ tic sh@@ e@@ et , and the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es had to c@@ ut the tre@@ es , and just like this ."
But over two million people c@@ ut tre@@ es .
"It just became big , he@@ av@@ y de@@ for@@ es@@ tation and an environ@@ mental problem ."
"That is why they started provi@@ ding al@@ u@@ minu@@ m pi@@ pes , al@@ u@@ minu@@ m bar@@ ra@@ cks ."
"V@@ er@@ y ex@@ pen@@ sive , they thro@@ w them out for money , then cu@@ tting tre@@ es again ."
"So I pro@@ posed my idea to impro@@ ve the sit@@ u@@ ation using these rec@@ y@@ c@@ led pap@@ er tu@@ bes because this is so che@@ ap and also so st@@ rong , but my bu@@ d@@ get is only 50 U.S. dollars per un@@ it ."
"We built 50 un@@ its to do that as a mon@@ i@@ tor@@ ing test for the du@@ ra@@ bility and mo@@ is@@ ture and ter@@ m@@ ites , so on ."
"And then , year af@@ ter@@ ward , 199@@ 5 , in Ko@@ be , J@@ ap@@ an , we had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"N@@ early 7@@ ,000 people were kil@@ led , and the city like this N@@ ag@@ ata dis@@ tri@@ ct , all the city was bur@@ ned in a fi@@ re after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
And also I found out there &apos;s many Vi@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ me@@ se re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing and ga@@ ther@@ ing at a C@@ ath@@ o@@ lic ch@@ ur@@ ch — all the building was to@@ tally de@@ st@@ roy@@ ed .
"So I went there and also I pro@@ posed to the pri@@ es@@ ts , &quot; Why don &apos;t we re@@ build the ch@@ ur@@ ch out of pap@@ er tu@@ bes ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you cra@@ z@@ y ?"
"A@@ f@@ ter a fi@@ re , what are you pro@@ pos@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; So he never tr@@ us@@ ted me , but I didn &apos;t give up ."
"I started com@@ mu@@ ting to Ko@@ be , and I met the society of Vi@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ me@@ se people ."
They were living like this with very po@@ or plas@@ tic sh@@ e@@ ets in the par@@ k .
So I pro@@ posed to re@@ build . I ra@@ is@@ ed — did fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing .
"I made a pap@@ er tu@@ be sh@@ el@@ ter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demo@@ lish , I used be@@ er cra@@ tes as a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
"I asked the K@@ ir@@ in be@@ er company to pro@@ pose , because at that time , the A@@ sa@@ h@@ i be@@ er company made their plas@@ tic be@@ er cra@@ tes red , which doesn &apos;t go with the co@@ lor of the pap@@ er tu@@ bes ."
The co@@ lor co@@ ordin@@ ation is very important .
"And also I still remember , we were expe@@ cting to have a be@@ er inside the plas@@ tic be@@ er cra@@ te , but it came em@@ p@@ ty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting ."
"So during the sum@@ mer with my students , we built over 50 un@@ its of the sh@@ el@@ ters ."
"F@@ in@@ ally the pri@@ est , finally he tr@@ us@@ ted me to re@@ build ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you colle@@ ct money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five we@@ eks re@@ building the ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"It was me@@ ant to sta@@ y there for three years , but actually it sta@@ y@@ ed there 10 years because people lo@@ ved it ."
"Th@@ en , in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an , they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and we pro@@ posed to don@@ ate this ch@@ ur@@ ch , so we dis@@ man@@ t@@ led them , we s@@ ent them over to be built by vol@@ un@@ te@@ er people ."
It sta@@ y@@ ed there in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an as a per@@ man@@ ent ch@@ ur@@ ch even now .
So this building became a per@@ man@@ ent building .
"Th@@ en I won@@ der , what is a per@@ man@@ ent and what is a tem@@ por@@ ary building ?"
E@@ ven a building made in pap@@ er can be per@@ man@@ ent as long as people love it .
E@@ ven a con@@ cre@@ te building can be very tem@@ por@@ ary if that is made to make money .
"In 199@@ 9 , in T@@ ur@@ key , the big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , I went there to use the local materi@@ al to build a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"@@ 200@@ 1 , in W@@ est India , I built also a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"In 200@@ 4 , in S@@ ri L@@ an@@ ka , after the Su@@ ma@@ tra ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ sun@@ ami , I re@@ built Is@@ la@@ mic fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s v@@ ill@@ ages ."
"And in 200@@ 8 , in Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u , S@@ ich@@ u@@ an area in China , ne@@ ar@@ ly 7@@ 0,000 people were kil@@ led , and also es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally many of the scho@@ ols were de@@ st@@ roy@@ ed because of the cor@@ ru@@ ption between the au@@ thor@@ ity and the con@@ tra@@ c@@ tor ."
I was asked to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary ch@@ ur@@ ch .
I bro@@ ught my J@@ apan@@ ese students to work with the Ch@@ in@@ ese students .
"In one mon@@ th , we comple@@ ted n@@ ine clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s , over 500 squ@@ are me@@ ters ."
"It &apos;s still used , even after the cur@@ r@@ ent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in China ."
"In 200@@ 9 , in I@@ tal@@ y , L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"And this is a very interesting pho@@ to : for@@ mer P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ is@@ ter B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i and J@@ apan@@ ese for@@ mer for@@ mer for@@ mer for@@ mer P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ is@@ ter M@@ r. A@@ so — you know , because we have to change the pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter ever year ."
"And they are very kind , af@@ for@@ ding my model ."
"I pro@@ posed a big re@@ building , a tem@@ por@@ ary music h@@ all , because L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a is very f@@ am@@ ous for music and all the con@@ cer@@ t h@@ alls were de@@ st@@ roy@@ ed , so mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans were moving out ."
"So I pro@@ posed to the may@@ or , I &apos;d like to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary au@@ di@@ to@@ ri@@ um ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ."
"M@@ r. B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i bro@@ ught G@@ 8 sum@@ m@@ it , and our for@@ mer pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter came , so they hel@@ ped us to colle@@ ct money , and I got half a million eu@@ ros from the J@@ apan@@ ese government to re@@ build this tem@@ por@@ ary au@@ di@@ to@@ ri@@ um ."
"@@ Ye@@ ar 20@@ 10 in H@@ a@@ iti , there was a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but it &apos;s im@@ possible to f@@ ly over , so I went to S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go , ne@@ x@@ t-@@ do@@ or country , to dri@@ ve six hours to get to H@@ a@@ iti with the local students in S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go to build 50 un@@ its of sh@@ el@@ ter out of local pap@@ er tu@@ bes ."
"This is what happened in J@@ ap@@ an two years ago , in nor@@ ther@@ n J@@ ap@@ an ."
"A@@ f@@ ter the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ sun@@ ami , people had to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated in a big room like a gy@@ mn@@ as@@ i@@ um ."
But look at this . There &apos;s no p@@ riv@@ ac@@ y .
Pe@@ ople su@@ f@@ fer men@@ tally and physi@@ cally .
"So we went there to build parti@@ tions with all the stu@@ dent vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with pap@@ er tu@@ bes , just a very simple sh@@ el@@ ter out of the tu@@ be fra@@ me and the cur@@ tain ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , some of the fac@@ ility au@@ thor@@ ity doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them ."
But it &apos;s really ne@@ cess@@ ary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough fl@@ at area to build stan@@ d@@ ard government sing@@ le@@ -@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing like this one .
"L@@ o@@ ok at this . E@@ ven civi@@ l government is doing such po@@ or con@@ struc@@ tion of the tem@@ por@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing , so den@@ se and so mess@@ y because there is no sto@@ rag@@ e , nothing , water is le@@ aking , so I thought , we have to make mul@@ ti@@ -@@ story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very com@@ for@@ table ."
So I pro@@ posed to the may@@ or while I was making parti@@ tions .
F@@ in@@ ally I met a very n@@ ice may@@ or in O@@ n@@ ag@@ aw@@ a v@@ ill@@ age in M@@ i@@ y@@ ag@@ i .
He asked me to build thre@@ e-@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing on bas@@ eb@@ all &#91; fiel@@ ds &#93; .
"I used the shi@@ p@@ ping con@@ tain@@ er and also the students hel@@ ped us to make all the building fu@@ r@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ re to make them com@@ for@@ table , within the bu@@ d@@ get of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more com@@ for@@ table ."
M@@ any of the people want to sta@@ y here for@@ ever .
I was very happy to hear that .
"Now I am working in New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Chris@@ t@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"A@@ b@@ out 20 days before the J@@ apan@@ ese ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake happened , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and many J@@ apan@@ ese students were also kil@@ led , and the most important ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral of the city , the sym@@ bo@@ l of Chris@@ t@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch , was to@@ tally de@@ st@@ roy@@ ed ."
And I was asked to come to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral .
So this is under con@@ struc@@ tion .
And I &apos;d like to keep building mon@@ u@@ ments that are be@@ lo@@ ved by people .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What is going on in this bab@@ y &apos;s mind ?
"If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , inclu@@ ding psy@@ cho@@ logis@@ ts , would have said that this bab@@ y was ir@@ ra@@ tional , il@@ log@@ ical , e@@ go@@ cen@@ tri@@ c — that he couldn &apos;t take the per@@ spe@@ ctive of another person or understand cause and effe@@ ct ."
"In the last 20 years , develo@@ p@@ mental science has completely over@@ turned that picture ."
"So in some ways , we think that this bab@@ y &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant scientists ."
Let me give you just one example of this .
"One thing that this bab@@ y could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other bab@@ y ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , one of the things that &apos;s har@@ de@@ st for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feel@@ ing ."
And maybe the har@@ de@@ st thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
An@@ y@@ one who &apos;s follo@@ wed poli@@ tics can te@@ sti@@ f@@ y to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if bab@@ ies and young children could understand this really pro@@ found thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
"B@@ ab@@ ies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-@@ old to tell you what he thin@@ ks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stre@@ am of consci@@ ous@@ ness mon@@ olog@@ ue about pon@@ ies and bir@@ th@@ days and things like that ."
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the se@@ cre@@ t was bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
"What we did — Be@@ tty R@@ ap@@ ach@@ oli , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the bab@@ ies two bo@@ w@@ ls of food : one bo@@ w@@ l of ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bo@@ w@@ l of deli@@ ci@@ ous g@@ ol@@ d@@ fish cra@@ ck@@ ers ."
"Now all of the bab@@ ies , even in B@@ er@@ kle@@ y , like the cra@@ ck@@ ers and don &apos;t like the ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
( Laughter ) But then what Be@@ tty did was to take a little tas@@ te of food from each bo@@ w@@ l .
And she would act as if she lik@@ ed it or she didn &apos;t .
"So half the time , she ac@@ ted as if she lik@@ ed the cra@@ ck@@ ers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i — just like a bab@@ y and any other s@@ ane person ."
"But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m , bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"I tas@@ ted the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i . M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the cra@@ ck@@ ers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uc@@ k , cra@@ ck@@ ers ."
"I tas@@ ted the cra@@ ck@@ ers . E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uc@@ k . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the op@@ pos@@ ite of what the bab@@ ies wanted ."
We did this with 15 and 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies .
"And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; C@@ an you give me some ? &quot;"
"So the question is : What would the bab@@ y give her , what they lik@@ ed or what she lik@@ ed ?"
"And the re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble thing was that 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies , just b@@ are@@ ly wal@@ king and talking , would give her the cra@@ ck@@ ers if she lik@@ ed the cra@@ ck@@ ers , but they would give her the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i if she lik@@ ed the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"O@@ n the other hand , 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds would st@@ are at her for a long time if she ac@@ ted as if she lik@@ ed the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out ."
"But then after they star@@ ed for a long time , they would just give her the cra@@ ck@@ ers , what they thought everybody must like ."
So there are two really re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble things about this .
"The first one is that these little 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies have already disco@@ vered this really pro@@ found fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing ."
"And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted ."
"E@@ ven more re@@ mar@@ ka@@ bly though , the fact that 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds didn &apos;t do this sug@@ g@@ es@@ ts that these 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds had learned this de@@ ep , pro@@ found fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old ."
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hundre@@ ds and hundre@@ ds of stu@@ dies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ted it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a shor@@ t time ?
"I mean , after all , if you look at bab@@ ies super@@ fici@@ ally , they see@@ m pretty u@@ se@@ less ."
"And actually in many ways , they &apos;re wor@@ se than u@@ se@@ less , because we have to put so much time and energy into just ke@@ ep@@ ing them ali@@ ve ."
"But if we turn to evol@@ ution for an answer to this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of why we spend so much time taking care of u@@ se@@ less bab@@ ies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer ."
"If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pri@@ ma@@ tes , but also inclu@@ ding other ma@@ m@@ m@@ als , bir@@ ds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like kan@@ g@@ aro@@ os and w@@ om@@ ba@@ ts , it turns out that there &apos;s a relation@@ ship between how long a chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od a species has and how big their bra@@ ins are com@@ par@@ ed to their bo@@ dies and how smar@@ t and f@@ lex@@ i@@ ble they are ."
And sort of the pos@@ ter@@ bir@@ ds for this idea are the bir@@ ds up there .
O@@ n one side is a New C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ ian cro@@ w .
"And cro@@ ws and other cor@@ vi@@ da@@ e , ra@@ ven@@ s , ro@@ o@@ ks and so for@@ th , are incredi@@ bly smar@@ t bir@@ ds ."
They &apos;re as smar@@ t as chim@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ es in some re@@ spe@@ cts .
And this is a b@@ ird on the co@@ ver of science who &apos;s learned how to use a to@@ ol to get food .
"O@@ n the other hand , we have our friend the do@@ me@@ sti@@ c ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en ."
And ch@@ ic@@ ken@@ s and duc@@ ks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ ke@@ ys are basically as du@@ m@@ b as du@@ m@@ ps .
"So they &apos;re very , very good at pe@@ c@@ king for gra@@ in , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else ."
"Well it turns out that the bab@@ ies , the New C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ ian cro@@ w bab@@ ies , are fle@@ d@@ g@@ lin@@ gs ."
"They depen@@ d on their mo@@ ms to dro@@ p wor@@ ms in their little open m@@ ou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a b@@ ird ."
Wh@@ ere@@ as the ch@@ ic@@ ken@@ s are actually ma@@ ture within a couple of months .
So chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od is the reason why the cro@@ ws end up on the co@@ ver of S@@ ci@@ ence and the ch@@ ic@@ ken@@ s end up in the s@@ ou@@ p po@@ t .
There &apos;s something about that long chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od that see@@ ms to be conne@@ cted to knowledge and learning .
Well what kind of ex@@ plan@@ ation could we have for this ?
"Well some animals , like the ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en , see@@ m to be beauti@@ fully su@@ i@@ ted to doing just one thing very well ."
So they see@@ m to be beauti@@ fully su@@ i@@ ted to pe@@ c@@ king gra@@ in in one environment .
"O@@ ther crea@@ tures , like the cro@@ ws , ar@@ en &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extre@@ me@@ ly good at learning about la@@ ws of different environ@@ ments ."
"And of course , we human be@@ ings are way out on the end of the dis@@ tribu@@ tion like the cro@@ ws ."
We have big@@ ger bra@@ ins rela@@ tive to our bo@@ dies by far than any other anima@@ l .
"We &apos;re smar@@ ter , we &apos;re more f@@ lex@@ i@@ ble , we can learn more , we sur@@ vi@@ ve in more different environ@@ ments , we mi@@ gra@@ ted to co@@ ver the world and even go to ou@@ ter space ."
And our bab@@ ies and children are depen@@ dent on us for much longer than the bab@@ ies of any other species .
My son is 2@@ 3 .
"( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 2@@ 3 , we &apos;re still po@@ p@@ ping those wor@@ ms into those little open m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"A@@ ll right , why would we see this cor@@ rela@@ tion ?"
"Well an idea is that that stra@@ te@@ g@@ y , that learning stra@@ te@@ g@@ y , is an extre@@ me@@ ly powerful , great stra@@ te@@ g@@ y for getting on in the world , but it has one big dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ge ."
"And that one big dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ge is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be hel@@ ple@@ ss ."
"So you don &apos;t want to have the mas@@ to@@ don char@@ ging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A s@@ lin@@ g@@ sho@@ t or maybe a spe@@ ar might work . Wh@@ ich would actually be better ? &quot;"
You want to know all that before the mas@@ to@@ d@@ ons actually show up .
And the way the evol@@ u@@ tions see@@ ms to have sol@@ ved that problem is with a kind of di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
So the idea is that we have this early peri@@ od when we &apos;re completely prote@@ cted .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
"And then as ad@@ ul@@ ts , we can take all those things that we learned when we were bab@@ ies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world ."
So one way of thinking about it is that bab@@ ies and young children are like the research and develo@@ pment di@@ vision of the human species .
"So they &apos;re the prote@@ cted blu@@ e sk@@ y guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re produc@@ tion and marke@@ ting ."
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
"A@@ no@@ ther way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of bab@@ ies and children as being like de@@ fe@@ ctive grow@@ n@@ up@@ s , we should think about them as being a different develo@@ p@@ mental sta@@ ge of the same species — kind of like ca@@ ter@@ p@@ il@@ lar@@ s and bu@@ tter@@ f@@ lies — ex@@ cept that they &apos;re actually the bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant bu@@ tter@@ f@@ lies who are f@@ lit@@ ting around the gar@@ den and expl@@ or@@ ing , and we &apos;re the ca@@ ter@@ p@@ il@@ lar@@ s who are in@@ ching along our nar@@ row , grow@@ n@@ up , ad@@ ult pa@@ th ."
"If this is true , if these bab@@ ies are desig@@ ned to learn — and this evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expe@@ ct that they would have really powerful learning me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms ."
"And in fact , the bab@@ y &apos;s brain see@@ ms to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet ."
But real compu@@ ters are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a re@@ vol@@ ution in our under@@ standing of machine learning re@@ cen@@ tly .
"And it all depen@@ ds on the ideas of this guy , the Re@@ ver@@ end Th@@ o@@ mas B@@ ay@@ es , who was a sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ an and mathe@@ mati@@ ci@@ an in the 18@@ th century ."
"And es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally what B@@ ay@@ es did was to provi@@ de a mathe@@ mati@@ cal way using prob@@ ability theor@@ y to charac@@ ter@@ ize , descri@@ be , the way that scientists find out about the world ."
So what scientists do is they have a hy@@ pothe@@ sis that they think might be lik@@ ely to start with .
They go out and test it against the evi@@ dence .
The evi@@ dence makes them change that hy@@ pothe@@ sis .
Th@@ en they test that new hy@@ pothe@@ sis and so on and so for@@ th .
And what B@@ ay@@ es sho@@ wed was a mathe@@ mati@@ cal way that you could do that .
And that mathe@@ mati@@ cs is at the cor@@ e of the best machine learning progra@@ ms that we have now .
"And some 10 years ago , I sug@@ g@@ es@@ ted that bab@@ ies might be doing the same thing ."
"So if you want to know what &apos;s going on under@@ ne@@ ath those beautiful bro@@ wn eyes , I think it actually looks something like this ."
This is Re@@ ver@@ end B@@ ay@@ es &apos;s n@@ ot@@ e@@ book .
So I think those bab@@ ies are actually making com@@ plic@@ ated cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions with condi@@ tional prob@@ ab@@ ili@@ ties that they &apos;re re@@ vis@@ ing to figure out how the world works .
"A@@ ll right , now that might see@@ m like an even tal@@ ler order to actually de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te ."
"Because after all , if you ask even grow@@ n@@ up@@ s about sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs , they look extre@@ me@@ ly stu@@ pi@@ d ."
How could it be that children are doing sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs ?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the B@@ li@@ c@@ ke@@ t De@@ te@@ c@@ tor .
This is a box that li@@ ghts up and pla@@ ys music when you put some things on it and not others .
"And using this very simple machine , my la@@ b and others have done do@@ z@@ ens of stu@@ dies sho@@ wing just how good bab@@ ies are at learning about the world ."
"L@@ et me men@@ tion just one that we did with T@@ u@@ ma@@ r K@@ us@@ h@@ ner , my stu@@ dent ."
"If I sho@@ wed you this de@@ te@@ c@@ tor , you would be lik@@ ely to think to beg@@ in with that the way to make the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor go would be to put a blo@@ ck on top of the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor ."
"But actually , this de@@ te@@ c@@ tor works in a bit of a str@@ an@@ ge way ."
"Because if you wa@@ ve a blo@@ ck over the top of the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to beg@@ in with , the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor will actually ac@@ tiv@@ ate two out of three times ."
"Wh@@ ere@@ as , if you do the lik@@ ely thing , put the blo@@ ck on the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor , it will only ac@@ tiv@@ ate two out of six times ."
So the un@@ lik@@ ely hy@@ pothe@@ sis actually has st@@ ron@@ ger evi@@ dence .
It looks as if the w@@ av@@ ing is a more effe@@ ctive stra@@ te@@ g@@ y than the other stra@@ te@@ g@@ y .
"So we did just this ; we gave four year-@@ ol@@ ds this patter@@ n of evi@@ dence , and we just asked them to make it go ."
"And sure enough , the four year-@@ ol@@ ds used the evi@@ dence to wa@@ ve the ob@@ ject on top of the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor ."
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
"The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-@@ ol@@ ds ."
They &apos;re just learning how to coun@@ t .
"But un@@ consci@@ ously , they &apos;re doing these quite com@@ plic@@ ated cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions that will give them a condi@@ tional prob@@ ability measu@@ re ."
"And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evi@@ dence to get to an idea , get to a hy@@ pothe@@ sis about the world , that see@@ ms very un@@ lik@@ ely to beg@@ in with ."
"And in stu@@ dies we &apos;ve just been doing in my la@@ b , si@@ mil@@ ar stu@@ dies , we &apos;ve show that four year-@@ ol@@ ds are actually better at fin@@ ding out an un@@ lik@@ ely hy@@ pothe@@ sis than ad@@ ul@@ ts are when we give them exactly the same tas@@ k ."
"So in these cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces , the children are using sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experi@@ ments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experi@@ ments ."
Wh@@ en children do experi@@ ments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; pla@@ ying . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a b@@ un@@ ch of interesting stu@@ dies re@@ cen@@ tly that have sho@@ wn this pla@@ ying around is really a kind of experi@@ mental research program .
Here &apos;s one from C@@ ris@@ tin@@ e L@@ eg@@ are &apos;s la@@ b .
What C@@ ris@@ tin@@ e did was use our B@@ li@@ c@@ ke@@ t De@@ te@@ c@@ tors .
"And what she did was show children that y@@ el@@ low ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she sho@@ wed them an an@@ om@@ al@@ y ."
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little bo@@ y will go through five hy@@ pothe@@ ses in the space of two minutes .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) B@@ oy : How about this ?
S@@ ame as the other side .
"A@@ lis@@ on G@@ op@@ ni@@ k : Okay , so his first hy@@ pothe@@ sis has just been fal@@ si@@ fi@@ ed ."
"( Laughter ) B@@ oy : This one li@@ gh@@ ted up , and this one nothing ."
"A@@ G : Okay , he &apos;s got his experi@@ mental n@@ ot@@ e@@ book out ."
B@@ oy : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
A@@ G : E@@ very scienti@@ st will reco@@ gn@@ ize that ex@@ pres@@ sion of des@@ pai@@ r .
"( Laughter ) B@@ oy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this ."
"A@@ G : Okay , hy@@ pothe@@ sis two ."
B@@ oy : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Now this is his next idea .
"He told the experi@@ men@@ ter to do this , to try pu@@ tting it out on@@ to the other lo@@ c@@ ation ."
N@@ ot working either .
"B@@ oy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here ."
"O@@ h , the bot@@ to@@ m of this box has electri@@ city in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electri@@ city ."
"A@@ G : Okay , that &apos;s a f@@ our@@ th hy@@ pothe@@ sis ."
B@@ oy : It &apos;s li@@ gh@@ ting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
"A@@ G : Okay , there &apos;s his fi@@ f@@ th hy@@ pothe@@ sis ."
"Now that is a particu@@ lar@@ ly — that is a particu@@ lar@@ ly ad@@ or@@ able and arti@@ cu@@ late little bo@@ y , but what C@@ ris@@ tin@@ e disco@@ vered is this is actually quite ty@@ pi@@ cal ."
"If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to expl@@ ain something , what they really do is do a ser@@ ies of experi@@ ments ."
This is actually pretty ty@@ pi@@ cal of four year-@@ ol@@ ds .
"Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of crea@@ ture ?"
What &apos;s it like to be one of these bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant bu@@ tter@@ f@@ lies who can test five hy@@ pothe@@ ses in two minutes ?
"Well , if you go back to those psy@@ cho@@ logis@@ ts and ph@@ i@@ loso@@ ph@@ ers , a lot of them have said that bab@@ ies and young children were b@@ are@@ ly consci@@ ous if they were consci@@ ous at all ."
And I think just the op@@ pos@@ ite is true .
I think bab@@ ies and children are actually more consci@@ ous than we are as ad@@ ul@@ ts .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how ad@@ ult consci@@ ous@@ ness works .
And ad@@ ul@@ ts &apos; atten@@ tion and consci@@ ous@@ ness look kind of like a spo@@ t@@ light .
"So what happens for ad@@ ul@@ ts is we deci@@ de that something &apos;s rele@@ v@@ ant or important , we should p@@ ay atten@@ tion to it ."
"O@@ ur consci@@ ous@@ ness of that thing that we &apos;re atten@@ ding to be@@ comes extre@@ me@@ ly b@@ right and vi@@ vi@@ d , and everything else sort of goes dar@@ k ."
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
"So what happens when we p@@ ay atten@@ tion is that the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x , the sort of exe@@ cu@@ tive part of our bra@@ ins , sen@@ ds a sig@@ n@@ al that makes a little part of our brain much more f@@ lex@@ i@@ ble , more plas@@ tic , better at learning , and sh@@ u@@ ts down ac@@ tivity in all the rest of our bra@@ ins ."
"So we have a very focu@@ sed , pur@@ po@@ se@@ -@@ d@@ riv@@ en kind of atten@@ tion ."
"If we look at bab@@ ies and young children , we see something very different ."
I think bab@@ ies and young children see@@ m to have more of a lan@@ ter@@ n of consci@@ ous@@ ness than a spo@@ t@@ light of consci@@ ous@@ ness .
So bab@@ ies and young children are very bad at nar@@ ro@@ wing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sour@@ ces at once .
"And if you actually look in their bra@@ ins , you see that they &apos;re f@@ loo@@ ded with these neuro@@ trans@@ mit@@ ters that are really good at in@@ duc@@ ing learning and plas@@ tic@@ ity , and the in@@ hi@@ bi@@ tory parts ha@@ ven &apos;t come on yet ."
"So when we say that bab@@ ies and young children are bad at pa@@ ying atten@@ tion , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not pa@@ ying atten@@ tion ."
So they &apos;re bad at getting ri@@ d of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
"That &apos;s the kind of atten@@ tion , the kind of consci@@ ous@@ ness , that we might expe@@ ct from those bu@@ tter@@ f@@ lies who are desig@@ ned to learn ."
"Well if we want to think about a way of getting a tas@@ te of that kind of bab@@ y consci@@ ous@@ ness as ad@@ ul@@ ts , I think the best thing is think about cas@@ es where we &apos;re put in a new sit@@ u@@ ation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we f@@ all in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time ."
"And what happens then is not that our consci@@ ous@@ ness con@@ tra@@ cts , it ex@@ pan@@ ds , so that those three days in Par@@ is see@@ m to be more full of consci@@ ous@@ ness and experience than all the months of being a wal@@ king , talking , fac@@ ul@@ ty me@@ e@@ tin@@ g@@ -@@ atten@@ ding z@@ om@@ bi@@ e back home ."
"And by the way , that co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , that wonderful co@@ f@@ fe@@ e you &apos;ve been d@@ rin@@ king do@@ w@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s , actually mi@@ mi@@ cs the effe@@ ct of those bab@@ y neuro@@ trans@@ mit@@ ters ."
So what &apos;s it like to be a bab@@ y ?
It &apos;s like being in love in Par@@ is for the first time after you &apos;ve had three d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ es@@ pre@@ ss@@ os .
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantas@@ tic way to be , but it does ten@@ d to leave you w@@ aking up c@@ r@@ ying at three o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the mor@@ ning . ( Laughter )"
Now it &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful bab@@ ies are .
It &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
We can do things like ti@@ e our sho@@ el@@ ac@@ es and cro@@ ss the stre@@ et by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of ef@@ for@@ t into making bab@@ ies think like ad@@ ul@@ ts do .
"But if what we want is to be like those bu@@ tter@@ f@@ lies , to have open@@ -@@ min@@ ded@@ ness , open learning , ima@@ gin@@ ation , crea@@ tivity , innov@@ ation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the ad@@ ul@@ ts to start thinking more like children ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S cam@@ pai@@ g@@ ner .
And this is the name of my cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n : S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n .
"In No@@ ve@@ m@@ ber of 200@@ 3 , I was in@@ vi@@ ted to take part in the lau@@ n@@ ch of N@@ el@@ son Man@@ de@@ la &apos;s 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation — that is his H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
And 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 is the number that Man@@ de@@ la had when he was im@@ pris@@ on@@ ed in R@@ ob@@ be@@ n Is@@ land .
"And that &apos;s me with Y@@ ou@@ ss@@ ou N &apos;@@ D@@ our , on@@ sta@@ ge , having the time of my life ."
"The next day , all the ar@@ tists were in@@ vi@@ ted to jo@@ in Man@@ de@@ la in R@@ ob@@ be@@ n Is@@ land , where he was going to give a con@@ fer@@ ence to the world &apos;s pre@@ ss , standing in front of his for@@ mer pris@@ on cell ."
You can see the bar@@ s of the win@@ do@@ w there .
It was quite a mo@@ men@@ to@@ us oc@@ cas@@ ion for all of us .
"In that moment in time , Man@@ de@@ la told the world &apos;s pre@@ ss that there was a vir@@ tual gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de taking place in his country ; that po@@ st@@ -@@ apar@@ thei@@ d R@@ ain@@ bo@@ w N@@ ation , a thous@@ and people were dy@@ ing on a dai@@ ly bas@@ is and that the front line v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able of all , were women and children ."
"This was a huge imp@@ act on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I ha@@ dn &apos;t realized that the H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S pan@@ de@@ mic was direc@@ tly af@@ fe@@ cting women in such a way ."
"And so I comm@@ it@@ ted — when I left S@@ outh Africa , when I left C@@ ap@@ eto@@ wn , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about ."
"I have to ser@@ ve . &quot; &quot; And so , sub@@ sequ@@ ently I parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted in every single 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent that I could take part in and gave news con@@ fer@@ ences , inter@@ vie@@ ws , talking and using my pl@@ at@@ form as a mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an , with my comm@@ it@@ ment to Man@@ de@@ la — out of re@@ spe@@ ct for the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous , un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able work that he had done ."
"E@@ very@@ one in the world re@@ spe@@ cts N@@ el@@ son Man@@ de@@ la , everyone re@@ ver@@ es N@@ el@@ son Man@@ de@@ la ."
"But do they all know about what has been taking place in S@@ outh Africa , his country , the country that had one of the high@@ est in@@ ci@@ dents of trans@@ mis@@ sion of the vir@@ us ?"
"I think that if I went out into the stre@@ et now and I told people what was happening there , they would be sho@@ c@@ ked ."
"I was very , very for@@ tun@@ ate a couple of years later to have met Z@@ ac@@ ki@@ e A@@ ch@@ ma@@ t , the f@@ oun@@ der of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n , an incredi@@ ble cam@@ pai@@ g@@ ner and ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ t ."
I met him at a 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent .
He was w@@ ear@@ ing a t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t like the one I we@@ ar now .
"This is a to@@ ol — this tel@@ ls you I am in so@@ li@@ dar@@ ity with people who have H@@ I@@ V , people who are living with H@@ I@@ V ."
"And in a way because of the stig@@ ma , by w@@ ear@@ ing this t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issu@@ e ."
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the clo@@ set . &quot; &quot; I became a mem@@ ber of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n and I &apos;m very pro@@ u@@ d to be a mem@@ ber of that incredi@@ ble organ@@ ization .
"It &apos;s a g@@ ras@@ s@@ ro@@ ots cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n with 80 percent mem@@ ber@@ ship being women , most of wh@@ om are H@@ I@@ V@@ -@@ posi@@ tive ."
They work in the field .
They have tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous ou@@ tre@@ ach to the people who are living direc@@ tly with the effe@@ cts of the vir@@ us .
They have education progra@@ ms .
They bring out the issu@@ es of stig@@ ma .
It &apos;s quite extra@@ ordin@@ ary what they do .
"And y@@ es , my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n has sup@@ por@@ ted T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n in the way that I have tried to ra@@ ise a@@ war@@ en@@ ess and to try to also ra@@ ise fun@@ ds ."
"A lot of the fun@@ ding that I have man@@ ag@@ ed to ra@@ ise has gone direc@@ tly to T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n and the incredi@@ ble work that they do , and are still contin@@ u@@ ing to do in S@@ outh Africa ."
So this is my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n .
S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to sup@@ port me .
I &apos;ve tra@@ v@@ ele@@ d all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
"@@ Here I am in O@@ s@@ lo in Nor@@ way , getting a n@@ ice , f@@ at che@@ ck ; sing@@ ing in H@@ on@@ g K@@ on@@ g , trying to get people to ra@@ ise money ."
"In Jo@@ h@@ an@@ ne@@ s@@ bur@@ g , I had the opportunity to play to a main@@ ly wh@@ ite , midd@@ le@@ -@@ clas@@ s S@@ outh Afri@@ can au@@ dience who en@@ ded up in te@@ ars because I use film cli@@ ps that really to@@ uch the heart , the whole nature , of this terri@@ ble tra@@ ge@@ dy that is taking place , that people are ten@@ ding to av@@ o@@ id , because they are fa@@ ti@@ gu@@ ed , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solu@@ tions are ."
"A@@ aro@@ n M@@ ot@@ so@@ al@@ e@@ di , the cur@@ r@@ ent health min@@ is@@ ter , atten@@ ded that con@@ cer@@ t and I had an opportunity to me@@ et with him , and he gave his absolu@@ te comm@@ it@@ ment to try to making a change , which is absolu@@ tely ne@@ cess@@ ary ."
This is in the S@@ c@@ ot@@ tis@@ h Par@@ li@@ a@@ ment .
I &apos;ve sub@@ sequ@@ ently become an en@@ v@@ oy for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land and H@@ I@@ V .
"And I was sho@@ wing them my experi@@ ences and trying to , again , ra@@ ise a@@ war@@ en@@ ess ."
"And once again , in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh with the wonderful Afri@@ can Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s C@@ ho@@ i@@ r who I simply ad@@ ore ."
"And it &apos;s children like this , many of wh@@ om have been or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed because of their family being af@@ fe@@ cted by the A@@ I@@ D@@ S vir@@ us ."
I &apos;m sitting here in New York with M@@ ich@@ el S@@ idi@@ be — he &apos;s the direc@@ tor of U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
"And I &apos;m very hon@@ or@@ ed by the fact that M@@ ich@@ el in@@ vi@@ ted me , only a few months ago , to become a U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ or ."
"And in this way , I &apos;ve been str@@ eng@@ then@@ ing my pl@@ at@@ form and bro@@ ad@@ en@@ ing my ou@@ tre@@ ach ."
The mess@@ age that U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S are cur@@ ren@@ tly sen@@ ding out to the world is that we would like to see the vir@@ tual eli@@ min@@ ation of the trans@@ mis@@ sion of the vir@@ us from mother to child by 20@@ 15 .
It &apos;s a very am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous go@@ al but we believe it can be ach@@ i@@ ev@@ ed with political will .
This can happen .
"And here I am with a pre@@ gn@@ ant woman , who is H@@ I@@ V posi@@ tive and we &apos;re s@@ mil@@ ing , both of us are s@@ mil@@ ing , because we &apos;re very con@@ fi@@ dent , because we know that that young woman is rec@@ ei@@ ving tre@@ at@@ ment so her life can be ex@@ ten@@ ded to take care of the bab@@ y she &apos;s about to give bir@@ th to ."
"And her bab@@ y will rec@@ ei@@ ve P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , which will mean that that bab@@ y can be born free of the vir@@ us ."
Now that is pre@@ ven@@ tion at the very beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to start looking at inter@@ ven@@ tion with the A@@ I@@ D@@ S pan@@ de@@ mic .
"Now , I just would like to fin@@ ish off to tell you the little story about A@@ ve@@ li@@ le ."
This is A@@ ve@@ li@@ le — she goes with me wh@@ er@@ ever I go .
I tell her story to everyone because she re@@ presen@@ ts one of mil@@ lions of H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S or@@ ph@@ ans .
A@@ ve@@ li@@ le &apos;s mother had H@@ I@@ V vir@@ us — she died from A@@ I@@ D@@ S@@ -@@ rela@@ ted ill@@ ness .
"A@@ ve@@ li@@ le had the vir@@ us , she was born with the vir@@ us ."
"And here she is at seven years old , w@@ eigh@@ ing no more than a one year-@@ old bab@@ y ."
"A@@ t this point in her life , she &apos;s su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing with ful@@ l@@ -@@ blo@@ wn A@@ I@@ D@@ S and had p@@ neu@@ mon@@ ia ."
We met her in a hos@@ p@@ ital in the E@@ as@@ ter@@ n C@@ ap@@ e and spent a whole af@@ ter@@ no@@ on with her — an ad@@ or@@ able child .
The doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses were ph@@ en@@ omen@@ al .
They put her on very speci@@ al nu@@ tri@@ ti@@ ous di@@ et and took great care of her .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hos@@ p@@ ital — because we fil@@ med her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
"So , it was obvi@@ ously — it was a very emo@@ tional en@@ coun@@ ter and left us feel@@ ing very res@@ on@@ ant with this di@@ re@@ ct experience , this one child , you know , that story ."
"F@@ i@@ ve months later , we went back to S@@ outh Africa to me@@ et A@@ ve@@ li@@ le again ."
And I &apos;m getting — the h@@ air@@ s on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the h@@ air@@ s on my ar@@ ms .
They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the trans@@ formation that took place .
Is@@ n &apos;t it extra@@ ordin@@ ary ?
( Applause ) That ro@@ und of ap@@ plause is actually for the doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses of the hos@@ p@@ ital who took care of A@@ ve@@ li@@ le .
And I take it that you ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate that kind of trans@@ formation .
"So , I would like to say to you , each one in the au@@ dience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nu@@ tri@@ tion and good medi@@ cal care , and you believe that the Mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ pment Go@@ als , speci@@ fic@@ ally five and six , should be absolu@@ tely comm@@ it@@ ted to by all govern@@ ments around the world — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in sub@@ -@@ Sa@@ har@@ an Africa — could you ple@@ ase stand up ."
"I think that &apos;s fai@@ r to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the h@@ all ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty years ago in the old So@@ vi@@ et Uni@@ on , a team of engine@@ ers was se@@ cre@@ tly moving a large ob@@ ject through a de@@ sol@@ ate coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
"W@@ ith it , they were ho@@ ping to cap@@ ture the min@@ ds of people every@@ where by being the first to con@@ qu@@ er ou@@ ter space ."
The ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t was huge .
And p@@ ac@@ ked in its no@@ se was a sil@@ ver b@@ all with two ra@@ di@@ os inside .
"O@@ n O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 4 , 19@@ 5@@ 7 , they lau@@ n@@ ched their ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t ."
One of the R@@ us@@ si@@ an scientists w@@ ro@@ te at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k .
"In the ol@@ den days , expl@@ or@@ ers like V@@ as@@ c@@ o da G@@ a@@ ma and C@@ ol@@ um@@ b@@ us had the good for@@ tu@@ ne to open up the ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al glo@@ be ."
Now we have the good for@@ tu@@ ne to open up space .
"And it is for those in the future to en@@ v@@ y us our j@@ oy . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wat@@ ching s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts from &quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , &quot; &quot; my fi@@ f@@ th do@@ cu@@ men@@ tar@@ y fe@@ a@@ ture , which is just about comple@@ ted ."
"It tel@@ ls the story of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , and the story of what happened to America as a resul@@ t ."
"For days after the lau@@ n@@ ch , S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was a wonderful cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity ."
"A man@@ -@@ made mo@@ on visi@@ ble by ordin@@ ary ci@@ tiz@@ ens , it inspi@@ red a@@ we and pri@@ de that humans had finally lau@@ n@@ ched an ob@@ ject into space ."
"But just three days later , on a day they called R@@ ed M@@ on@@ day , the media and the poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans told us , and we beli@@ ev@@ ed , that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was pro@@ of that our en@@ e@@ my had be@@ a@@ ten us in science and technology , and that they could now atta@@ ck us with hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en b@@ om@@ bs , using their S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t as an I@@ B@@ M mis@@ si@@ le ."
All h@@ ell bro@@ ke loo@@ se .
S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k quickly became one of the three great sho@@ cks to h@@ it America — h@@ isto@@ ri@@ ans say the equ@@ al of P@@ ear@@ l H@@ ar@@ b@@ or or 9 / 11 .
It pro@@ vo@@ ked the mis@@ si@@ le g@@ ap .
It ex@@ plo@@ ded an ar@@ ms ra@@ ce .
It began the space ra@@ ce .
"W@@ ith@@ in a year , Con@@ gre@@ ss fun@@ ded huge we@@ apo@@ ns incre@@ as@@ es , and we went from 1@@ ,@@ 200 n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar we@@ apo@@ ns to 20@@ ,000 ."
And the re@@ ac@@ tions to S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k went far be@@ y@@ ond we@@ apo@@ ns incre@@ as@@ es .
"For example , some here will remember this day , J@@ un@@ e 19@@ 5@@ 8 , the Na@@ tional C@@ i@@ vi@@ l D@@ ef@@ en@@ se D@@ ri@@ ll , where ten@@ s of mil@@ lions of people in 7@@ 8 cities went un@@ d@@ erg@@ ro@@ und ."
"O@@ r the G@@ all@@ up P@@ ol@@ l that sho@@ wed that seven in 10 Americ@@ ans beli@@ ev@@ ed that a n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be kil@@ led ."
But S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k pro@@ vo@@ ked wonderful changes as well .
"For example , some in this room went to school on sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship because of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k ."
"S@@ up@@ port for engine@@ er@@ ing , ma@@ th and science — education in gener@@ al — boo@@ med ."
"And V@@ in@@ t C@@ er@@ f poin@@ ts out that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k led direc@@ tly to A@@ R@@ P@@ A , and the Internet , and , of course , N@@ A@@ SA ."
My fe@@ a@@ ture do@@ cu@@ men@@ tar@@ y sho@@ ws how a free society can be sta@@ m@@ pe@@ ded by those who know how to use media .
"But it also sho@@ ws how we can turn what appe@@ ars at first to be a bad sit@@ u@@ ation , into something that was over@@ all very good for America ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k &quot; &quot; will so@@ on be rele@@ as@@ ed .
"In clo@@ sing , I would like to take a moment to than@@ k one of my inv@@ es@@ tors : lon@@ g@@ time TE@@ D@@ s@@ ter , J@@ ay W@@ al@@ ker ."
And I &apos;d like to than@@ k you all .

"Th@@ ank you , Ch@@ ris ."
"G@@ o@@ od mor@@ ning . So ma@@ gic is an ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent way for sta@@ ying a@@ head of the reality cur@@ ve , to make possible today what science will make a reality to@@ mor@@ row ."
"As a cy@@ ber@@ -@@ mag@@ ic@@ ian , I com@@ b@@ ine ele@@ ments of il@@ lu@@ sion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experi@@ en@@ ced ."
You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Pro@@ ject G@@ las@@ s .
"It &apos;s new technology . You look through them and the world you see is au@@ g@@ men@@ ted with data : n@@ ames of places , mon@@ u@@ ments , buil@@ din@@ gs , maybe one day even the n@@ ames of the str@@ ang@@ ers that pas@@ s you on the stre@@ et ."
So these are my il@@ lu@@ sion g@@ las@@ ses .
They &apos;re a little big@@ ger . They &apos;re a proto@@ ty@@ pe .
"And when you look through them , you get a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se into the mind of the cy@@ ber@@ -@@ il@@ lu@@ sion@@ ist ."
Let me show you what I mean .
All we need is a pla@@ ying car@@ d . An@@ y car@@ d will do .
L@@ ike this . And let me mar@@ k it so we can reco@@ gn@@ ize it when we see it again .
All right . V@@ er@@ y sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant mar@@ k .

I &apos;ve been at M@@ I@@ T for 4@@ 4 years .
And the third is a little bit less obvi@@ ous .
"H@@ ave they all ag@@ re@@ ed ? No , not completely ."
I &apos;ll bu@@ y it . I have so much money .

"L@@ ater , I under@@ sto@@ od why my father got so up@@ set ."
Th@@ ose s@@ we@@ ets were a bri@@ be from a con@@ tra@@ c@@ tor who was trying to get my father to a@@ ward him a government con@@ tra@@ ct .
"My father was respon@@ si@@ ble for building ro@@ ad@@ s in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r , and he had developed a fir@@ m stan@@ ce against cor@@ ru@@ ption , even though he was har@@ as@@ sed and thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed ."

O@@ n@@ ly I later realized that what he f@@ ed me was food for his entire family for two days .
This pro@@ found gi@@ ft of gener@@ os@@ ity chall@@ eng@@ ed and changed the very pur@@ pose of my life .
I re@@ sol@@ ved to give back .

It was B@@ i@@ ha@@ r all over again .

"And third , the eng@@ ag@@ e@@ ment in develo@@ ping countries was with a nar@@ row set of government el@@ ites with little inter@@ action with the ci@@ tiz@@ ens , who are the ul@@ ti@@ mate ben@@ ef@@ ic@@ i@@ ar@@ ies of develo@@ pment as@@ sis@@ tance ."
"T@@ o@@ day , each of these ele@@ ments is open@@ ing up du@@ e to dra@@ mati@@ c changes in the global environment ."
"O@@ pen knowledge , open aid , open govern@@ ance , and together , they re@@ present three key shi@@ f@@ ts that are trans@@ for@@ ming develo@@ pment and that also hold gre@@ ater hope for the problems I wit@@ ne@@ s@@ sed in U@@ gan@@ da and in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r ."
The first key shi@@ ft is open knowledge .
"They get their inspi@@ ra@@ tion , their hope , their prac@@ tical know@@ -@@ how , from suc@@ cess@@ ful e@@ mer@@ ging econom@@ ies in the S@@ outh ."
"And just as these Nor@@ th@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ S@@ outh trans@@ fer@@ s are open@@ ing up , so too are the develo@@ pment institu@@ tions that chan@@ ne@@ led these trans@@ fer@@ s ."
D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ pment institu@@ tions today are also open@@ ing for public s@@ c@@ ru@@ tin@@ y the pro@@ jects they fin@@ ance .
"In this man@@ ner , the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank has now G@@ e@@ o@@ M@@ ap@@ ped 3@@ 0,000 project ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties in 1@@ 4@@ 3 countries , and don@@ ors are using a common pl@@ at@@ form to ma@@ p all their pro@@ jects ."
This is a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous le@@ ap forward in trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy and ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility of aid .
"F@@ ro@@ m the A@@ ra@@ b S@@ p@@ ring to the An@@ na H@@ az@@ are movement in India , using mo@@ bil@@ e ph@@ ones and social media not just for political ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility but also for develo@@ pment ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility ."
A@@ re govern@@ ments deli@@ ver@@ ing serv@@ ices to the ci@@ tiz@@ ens ?
"So for in@@ stan@@ ce , se@@ ver@@ al govern@@ ments in Africa and E@@ as@@ ter@@ n Euro@@ pe are open@@ ing their bu@@ d@@ gets to the public ."
"This is a public bu@@ d@@ get . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble or under@@ stan@@ d@@ able to an ordin@@ ary ci@@ tiz@@ en that is trying to understand how the government is spen@@ ding its resour@@ ces ."
"To ta@@ ck@@ le this problem , govern@@ ments are using new tools to vis@@ u@@ al@@ ize the bu@@ d@@ get so it &apos;s more under@@ stan@@ d@@ able to the public ."
"In this ma@@ p from M@@ ol@@ do@@ va , the green co@@ lor sho@@ ws those dis@@ tri@@ cts that have low spen@@ ding on scho@@ ols but good educ@@ a@@ tional out@@ comes , and the red co@@ lor sho@@ ws the op@@ pos@@ ite ."
"T@@ o@@ ols like this help turn a sh@@ el@@ f full of in@@ s@@ c@@ ru@@ table do@@ cu@@ ments into a pub@@ li@@ c@@ ly under@@ stan@@ d@@ able vis@@ ual , and what &apos;s exci@@ ting is that with this open@@ ness , there are today new oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties for ci@@ tiz@@ ens to give fe@@ ed@@ back and eng@@ age with government ."
"So in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ pin@@ es today , parents and students can give real@@ -@@ time fe@@ ed@@ back on a w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite , Ch@@ e@@ ck@@ my@@ scho@@ ol@@ .@@ or@@ g , or using S@@ M@@ S , whether teach@@ ers and te@@ x@@ t@@ books are sho@@ wing up in school , the same problems I wit@@ ne@@ s@@ sed in U@@ gan@@ da and in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r ."
"And you know what &apos;s exci@@ ting is that this innov@@ ation is now spre@@ ad@@ ing S@@ outh to S@@ outh , from the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ pin@@ es to In@@ don@@ es@@ ia , Ken@@ y@@ a , M@@ ol@@ do@@ va and be@@ y@@ ond ."
"Th@@ ese are the lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors like my father and many , many others , and a key fron@@ ti@@ er of develo@@ pment work is to help these lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors jo@@ in hands so they can together over@@ come the od@@ ds ."
"Th@@ ese exam@@ ples give new hope , new possi@@ bility to the problems I wit@@ ne@@ s@@ sed in U@@ gan@@ da or that my father con@@ fron@@ ted in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r ."
"T@@ w@@ o years ago , on Ap@@ ri@@ l 8@@ th , 20@@ 10 , I called my father ."
"It was very late at night , and at age 80 , he was ty@@ ping a 7@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ age public inter@@ est li@@ ti@@ g@@ ation against cor@@ ru@@ ption in a ro@@ ad project ."
"He f@@ ou@@ ght ti@@ ll the end , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly pas@@ sion@@ ate that to com@@ b@@ at cor@@ ru@@ ption and po@@ ver@@ ty , not only did government of@@ fici@@ als need to be hon@@ est , but ci@@ tiz@@ ens needed to jo@@ in together to make their vo@@ ices heard ."
"Th@@ ese became the two boo@@ ken@@ ds of his life , and the jour@@ ney he tra@@ v@@ ele@@ d in between mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red the chan@@ ging develo@@ pment lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m inspi@@ red by these changes , and I &apos;m exci@@ ted that at the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank , we are em@@ bra@@ cing these new direc@@ tions , a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant de@@ par@@ ture from my work in U@@ gan@@ da 20 years ago ."
"We need to ra@@ dic@@ ally open up develo@@ pment so knowledge flo@@ ws in mul@@ ti@@ ple direc@@ tions , inspi@@ ring prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers , so aid be@@ comes trans@@ par@@ ent , ac@@ coun@@ table and effe@@ ctive , so govern@@ ments open up and ci@@ tiz@@ ens are eng@@ ag@@ ed and em@@ power@@ ed with re@@ for@@ mers in government ."
We need to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate these shi@@ f@@ ts .
"If we do , we will find that the colle@@ ctive vo@@ ices of the po@@ or will be heard in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r , in U@@ gan@@ da , and be@@ y@@ ond ."
It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s ol@@ de@@ st inven@@ tions : a b@@ ar of so@@ ap .
H@@ and@@ was@@ hing with so@@ ap ke@@ ep@@ s kids in school .
It sto@@ ps bab@@ ies from dy@@ ing .
"It can sa@@ ve over 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 children every year ."
I think you &apos;ll ag@@ ree with me that that &apos;s a pretty u@@ se@@ ful public health inter@@ ven@@ tion .
"A@@ ll right , get to know each other ."
"P@@ re@@ tty y@@ uc@@ k@@ y , you would ag@@ ree with me ."
What is it ? I@@ s there no so@@ ap ?
"A@@ c@@ tually , so@@ ap is av@@ ail@@ able ."
"In 90 percent of h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ ds in India , 9@@ 4 percent of h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ ds in Ken@@ y@@ a , you will find so@@ ap ."
"E@@ ven in countries where so@@ ap is the lo@@ w@@ est , like E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia , we are at 50 percent ."
So why is it ?
"Wh@@ y is it that M@@ ay@@ ank , this young bo@@ y that I met in India , isn &apos;t was@@ hing his hands ?"
"Well , in M@@ ay@@ ank &apos;s family , so@@ ap is used for ba@@ thing , so@@ ap is used for lau@@ n@@ d@@ ry , so@@ ap is used for was@@ hing dis@@ h@@ es ."
"H@@ is parents think sometimes it &apos;s a pre@@ ci@@ ous com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cu@@ p@@ bo@@ ard ."
They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t was@@ te it .
What &apos;s the resul@@ t of that ?
Th@@ in@@ k about where you learned to was@@ h your hands .
Di@@ d you learn to was@@ h your hands at home ?
Di@@ d you learn to was@@ h your hands in school ?
I think behavi@@ or@@ al scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the ha@@ b@@ its that you have had early in life .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , we all co@@ py what everyone else does , and local cul@@ tural nor@@ ms are something that shap@@ e how we change our behavior , and this is where the p@@ riv@@ ate se@@ c@@ tor comes in ."
I@@ con@@ ic b@@ ran@@ ds like this one have a respon@@ si@@ bility to do good in the places where they se@@ ll their produc@@ ts .
Th@@ in@@ k about it : M@@ arke@@ te@@ ers spend all their time making us s@@ wit@@ ch from one br@@ and to the other .
"And actually , they know how to trans@@ form science and fac@@ ts into compe@@ l@@ ling mess@@ ages ."
"A hundre@@ d and eigh@@ te@@ en years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about en@@ sur@@ ing that they have access to this b@@ ar of so@@ ap , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop ch@@ ol@@ era from spre@@ ad@@ ing ."
The bu@@ d@@ get is not always there .
"In shor@@ t , those that fi@@ ght for public health are actually depen@@ dent upo@@ n the so@@ ap companies to keep pro@@ mo@@ ting h@@ and@@ was@@ hing with so@@ ap ."
We &apos;ve had over 30 million vie@@ ws .
"I come from M@@ al@@ i , one of the world &apos;s po@@ or@@ est countries ."
I gre@@ w up in a family where every din@@ ner con@@ vers@@ ation was around social j@@ us@@ tice .
We &apos;ve re@@ ach@@ ed over 18@@ 3 million people in 1@@ 6 countries .
"L@@ ast week , my team and I spent time visi@@ ting mo@@ th@@ ers that have all experi@@ en@@ ced the same thing : the death of a ne@@ w@@ born ."
"She had the most beautiful s@@ mil@@ e , the s@@ mil@@ e , I think , that life gi@@ ves you when you &apos;ve had a second chan@@ ce ."
"H@@ er son , M@@ yo , is her second one ."
"And next time you think of a gi@@ ft for a new mo@@ m and her family , don &apos;t look far : bu@@ y her so@@ ap ."
It &apos;s the most beautiful inven@@ tion in public health .
"We are all fami@@ li@@ ar with these m@@ un@@ d@@ ane , every@@ day ob@@ jects ."
And it is quite possi@@ bly the lar@@ gest ever disco@@ vered .
The inter@@ national cri@@ min@@ al tri@@ b@@ un@@ al deli@@ vered a number of sen@@ ten@@ ces for cri@@ mes against human@@ ity and gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de .
"It is also about de@@ st@@ roy@@ ing their pro@@ per@@ ty , their cul@@ tural her@@ it@@ age , and ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely the very no@@ tion that they ever exis@@ ted ."
G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is not only about the kil@@ ling ; it is about the den@@ i@@ ed identi@@ ty .
"P@@ ho@@ to@@ grap@@ h@@ y is about em@@ path@@ y , and the fami@@ li@@ ar@@ ity of these ite@@ ms gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e em@@ path@@ y ."
( Applause )
Th@@ in@@ k of a hard choice you &apos;ll face in the ne@@ ar future .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challen@@ ges .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ ro@@ us before I started my 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challen@@ ges .
It &apos;s aw@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fu@@ n ."
( Applause )
( Laughter ) So this is the s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch of the two sta@@ tes .
One is to@@ tal cha@@ os . The other is absolu@@ te order .
This also re@@ min@@ ded us of two very different pic@@ to@@ ri@@ al tradi@@ tions .
"So this b@@ rin@@ gs me to a qui@@ e@@ ter , small work called H@@ and@@ hel@@ d ."
So here is the first test s@@ cen@@ ar@@ io .
In the shap@@ e of an am@@ ph@@ ithe@@ ater that &apos;s scal@@ ed to the size of an au@@ dience as per@@ c@@ ei@@ ved from somebody from the sta@@ ge .
S@@ e@@ ated in this au@@ dience are 9@@ 9@@ 6 small figu@@ res .
They &apos;re me@@ chan@@ ically en@@ ab@@ led to c@@ la@@ p of their own free will .
It also has an all@@ u@@ ring and trap@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it .
So we can &apos;t wa@@ it to be en@@ gu@@ l@@ f@@ ed by 9@@ 9@@ 6 of them .
"So to us , this work also presen@@ ts its own con@@ tradi@@ ction ."
( Applause )
"So in colle@@ ge , I was a government maj@@ or , which means I had to write a lot of pap@@ ers ."
And I would want to do that like that .
That would be the pl@@ an .
"I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the pap@@ er would come along , and then I would kind of do this ."
( Laughter ) And that would happen every single pap@@ er .
"But then came my 9@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ age sen@@ i@@ or the@@ sis , a pap@@ er you &apos;re sup@@ posed to spend a year on ."
"And I knew for a pap@@ er like that , my nor@@ mal work f@@ low was not an op@@ tion ."
It was way too big a project .
"So I plan@@ ned things out , and I decided I kind of had to go something like this ."
This is how the year would go .
"So I &apos;d start off light , and I &apos;d bu@@ m@@ p it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would k@@ ic@@ k it up into high ge@@ ar just like a little sta@@ ir@@ case ."
How hard could it be to walk up the sta@@ ir@@ s ?
"N@@ o big deal , right ?"
"But then , the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened ."
Th@@ ose first few months ?
"And then two months turned into one mon@@ th , which turned into two we@@ eks ."
I thought that was the end of everything .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That did not happen . ( Laughter )
"It was a very , very bad the@@ sis . ( Laughter )"
"I just wanted to en@@ j@@ oy that one moment when all of you thought , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )"
"N@@ o , no , it was very , very bad ."
"A@@ ny@@ way , today I &apos;m a w@@ rit@@ er@@ -@@ b@@ log@@ ger guy ."
I write the blo@@ g W@@ a@@ it But Why .
"And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation ."
"And to test this , I found an M@@ R@@ I la@@ b that actually let me s@@ can both my brain and the brain of a pro@@ ven non@@ -@@ pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ato@@ r , so I could com@@ par@@ e them ."
( Laughter ) Now ...
here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) There is a difference .
"Now , what does this mean for the pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ato@@ r ?"
"Well , it means everything &apos;s fin@@ e until this happens ."
"@@ &#91; This is a per@@ fect time to get some work done . &#93; &#91; No@@ pe ! &#93; So the R@@ a@@ tional De@@ c@@ is@@ ion@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er will make the ra@@ tional decis@@ ion to do something produc@@ tive , but the M@@ on@@ key doesn &apos;t like that pl@@ an , so he actually takes the whe@@ el , and he says , &quot; &quot; A@@ c@@ tually , let &apos;s read the entire W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia p@@ age of the N@@ an@@ cy K@@ er@@ ri@@ g@@ an / T@@ on@@ y@@ a H@@ ar@@ ding s@@ can@@ d@@ al , because I just remem@@ ber@@ ed that that happened ."
"Now , in the anima@@ l world , that works fin@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And to the M@@ on@@ key , humans are just another anima@@ l species ."
"But , if you ha@@ ven &apos;t no@@ tic@@ ed , now we &apos;re not in tri@@ bal times ."
"We &apos;re in an advan@@ ced civi@@ liz@@ ation , and the M@@ on@@ key does not know what that is ."
And he wan@@ ts to take all of that into ac@@ coun@@ t .
And he wan@@ ts to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now .
"But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are har@@ der and less ple@@ as@@ ant , for the s@@ ake of the big picture ."
And that &apos;s when we have a con@@ fli@@ ct .
I call it the D@@ ar@@ k P@@ la@@ y@@ ground .
"And the question is , in this sit@@ u@@ ation , with the M@@ on@@ key behind the whe@@ el , how does the pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ato@@ r ever get h@@ im@@ self over here to this blu@@ e z@@ one , a less ple@@ as@@ ant place , but where really important things happen ?"
"Well , turns out the pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ato@@ r has a gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an an@@ ge@@ l , someone who &apos;s always looking down on him and wat@@ ching over him in his d@@ ark@@ est mo@@ ments — someone called the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ s@@ ter ."
"And impor@@ tan@@ tly , he &apos;s the only thing the M@@ on@@ key is terri@@ fi@@ ed of ."
It &apos;s always been a dre@@ am of min@@ e to have done a TED T@@ al@@ k in the past .
D@@ o we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
"As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to rele@@ ase the spe@@ ak@@ ers ."
"And I open@@ ed up the w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite , and there was my face star@@ ing right back at me ."
"And finally , finally , the R@@ a@@ tional De@@ c@@ is@@ ion@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er can take the whe@@ el and I can start working on the talk ."
"It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works ."
This is what I decided to write about on the blo@@ g a couple of years ago .
"When I did , I was amaz@@ ed by the respon@@ se ."
"L@@ it@@ er@@ ally thousands of ema@@ il@@ s came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things ."
"Th@@ ese are people who were n@@ ur@@ ses , ban@@ k@@ ers , pa@@ inter@@ s , engine@@ ers and lots and lots of P@@ h@@ D students ."
But what struc@@ k me was the con@@ tr@@ ast between the light ton@@ e of the po@@ st and the he@@ av@@ in@@ ess of these ema@@ il@@ s .
"And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ato@@ r &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?"
Why are all of these people in such a dar@@ k place ?
"Well , it turns out that there &apos;s two kinds of pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation ."
"So if you wanted a care@@ er where you &apos;re a self-@@ star@@ ter — something in the ar@@ ts , something en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al — there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es on those things at first , because nothing &apos;s happening , not until you &apos;ve gone out and done the hard work to get mo@@ men@@ tu@@ m , get things going ."
"And it &apos;s this lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m kind of pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation that &apos;s much less visi@@ ble and much less tal@@ ked about than the fun@@ ni@@ er , shor@@ t-@@ ter@@ m de@@ ad@@ lin@@ e-@@ based kind ."
It &apos;s usu@@ ally su@@ f@@ fer@@ ed qui@@ e@@ tly and p@@ riv@@ a@@ tely .
"And it can be the sour@@ ce of a huge amount of lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m un@@ hap@@ pin@@ ess , and re@@ gre@@ ts ."
"And I thought , that &apos;s why those people are ema@@ il@@ ing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place ."
It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cra@@ m@@ ming for some project .
"It &apos;s that lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation has made them feel like a spe@@ c@@ ta@@ tor , at times , in their own lives ."
That &apos;s right — I think all of you are pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ a@@ tors .
"Now , you might not all be a me@@ ss , like some of us , ( Laughter ) and some of you may have a heal@@ th@@ y relation@@ ship with de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es , but remember : the M@@ on@@ key &apos;s s@@ ne@@ ak@@ i@@ est tri@@ ck is when the de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es ar@@ en &apos;t there ."
"Now , I want to show you one last thing ."
I call this a Li@@ fe C@@ al@@ en@@ d@@ ar .
That &apos;s one box for every week of a 9@@ 0@@ -@@ year life .
"So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that cal@@ en@@ d@@ ar ."
"We need to think about what we &apos;re really pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ating on , because everyone is pro@@ c@@ ras@@ tin@@ ating on something in life ."
We need to sta@@ y aw@@ are of the In@@ st@@ ant G@@ ra@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation M@@ on@@ key .
That &apos;s a job for all of us .
"And because there &apos;s not that many bo@@ x@@ es on there , it &apos;s a job that should probably start today ."
( Laughter ) You know .
S@@ ome@@ time so@@ on .
Thank you .
"One of the people he res@@ cu@@ ed was a ser@@ ge@@ ant , and he and a com@@ ra@@ de were making their way to a me@@ de@@ va@@ c he@@ li@@ co@@ p@@ ter ."
"I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?"
"What is that ? That is some de@@ ep , de@@ ep emo@@ tion , when you would want to do that ."
"There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?"
We have it bac@@ k@@ wards . Right ?
Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s this de@@ ep sense of tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation .
"I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; T@@ r@@ ust me , &quot; &quot; and you will ."
So where does that feel@@ ing come from ?
No@@ thing person@@ al .
"And so we evol@@ ved into social animals , where we li@@ ved together and worked together in what I call a cir@@ cle of sa@@ fe@@ ty , inside the tri@@ be , where we felt like we be@@ lon@@ ged ."
"And when we felt saf@@ e a@@ mon@@ g@@ st our own , the natural re@@ action was tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation ."
The mo@@ der@@ n day is exactly the same thing .
We have no control over these for@@ ces .
"Th@@ ese are a con@@ st@@ ant , and they &apos;re not going away ."
So I said something .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have tre@@ at us like c@@ at@@ tle ?"
Why can &apos;t you tre@@ at us like human be@@ ings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
"She said , &quot; &quot; Si@@ r , if I don &apos;t fol@@ low the ru@@ les , I could get in tro@@ u@@ ble or lo@@ se my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel saf@@ e . All she was telling me is th@@ at@@ "
she doesn &apos;t tr@@ ust her lead@@ ers .
The reason we like fl@@ ying S@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ir@@ lin@@ es is not because they ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly hi@@ re better people .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fe@@ ar their lead@@ ers .
"The clo@@ se@@ st anal@@ og@@ y I can give to what a great le@@ a@@ der is , is like being a par@@ ent ."
We would never do it .
It &apos;s the comple@@ te op@@ pos@@ ite .
It &apos;s not the numbers .
It &apos;s that they have viol@@ ated the very defin@@ i@@ tion of lead@@ er@@ ship .
They have viol@@ ated this de@@ ep@@ -@@ se@@ ated social con@@ tra@@ ct .
How about a $ 2@@ 50 million b@@ on@@ us to M@@ other T@@ er@@ es@@ a ?
D@@ o we have an issu@@ e with that ? N@@ one at all . N@@ one at all .
Gre@@ at lead@@ ers would never s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice
And Bo@@ b re@@ fu@@ sed .
"You see , Bo@@ b doesn &apos;t believe in head coun@@ ts ."
"B@@ o@@ b beli@@ ev@@ es in heart coun@@ ts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply re@@ duce the heart coun@@ t ."
And so they came up with a fu@@ r@@ l@@ ough program .
"They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it con@@ se@@ cu@@ tively ."
Th@@ ose who could af@@ for@@ d it more would tra@@ de with those who could af@@ for@@ d it less .
Le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship is a choice . It is not a ran@@ k .
"They are au@@ thor@@ i@@ ties , and we do what they say because they have au@@ thor@@ ity over us , but we would not fol@@ low them ."
"I heard a story of some Mar@@ ines who were out in the@@ ater , and as is the Mar@@ ine cus@@ to@@ m , the of@@ fic@@ er ate last , and he let his men e@@ at first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him ."
"And when they went back out in the field , his men bro@@ ught him some of their food so that he may e@@ at , because that &apos;s what happens ."
We call them lead@@ ers because they go first .
"They will give us their bloo@@ d and s@@ we@@ at and te@@ ars to see that their le@@ a@@ der &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?"
Why would you give your bloo@@ d and s@@ we@@ at and te@@ ars for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
And isn &apos;t that the organ@@ ization we would all like to work in ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"So I gre@@ w up in L@@ im@@ po@@ po , on the bor@@ der of L@@ im@@ po@@ po and M@@ pu@@ mal@@ ang@@ a , a little to@@ wn called M@@ ot@@ e@@ te@@ ma ."

"So I was like , o@@ kay , so we &apos;ve got the for@@ mu@@ la ready ."
Now we need to get this thing into prac@@ tice .
"F@@ ast forward four years later , after having w@@ rit@@ ten a 4@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ age business pl@@ an on the cell phone , having w@@ rit@@ ten my pa@@ tent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youn@@ gest pa@@ ten@@ t-@@ h@@ ol@@ der in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more ba@@ thing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had inven@@ ted D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath , the world &apos;s first b@@ ath@@ -@@ sub@@ stitu@@ ting lo@@ tion ."
"You liter@@ ally put it on your sk@@ in , and you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ."
"( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the li@@ mi@@ ted resour@@ ces I had , I went to uni@@ versity , met a few people , got it into prac@@ tice , and we have a fully fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing produc@@ t that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually av@@ ail@@ able on the market ."
So we learned a few le@@ ss@@ ons in com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al@@ iz@@ ing and making D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath av@@ ail@@ able .
One of the things we learned was that po@@ or comm@@ uni@@ ties don &apos;t bu@@ y produc@@ ts in bu@@ l@@ k .
So we p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ged D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath in these inno@@ va@@ tive little s@@ ach@@ ets .
"You just s@@ na@@ p them in half , and you squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze it out ."
"And the co@@ ol part is , one s@@ ach@@ et sub@@ stitu@@ tes one b@@ ath for five r@@ and ."
"A@@ f@@ ter cre@@ ating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of im@@ ple@@ men@@ ting the produc@@ t ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seeing that global imp@@ act , we nar@@ ro@@ wed it down to our key val@@ ue pro@@ posi@@ tion , which was cle@@ an@@ lin@@ ess and con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence ."
D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath is a ri@@ ch man &apos;s con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence and a po@@ or man &apos;s li@@ fes@@ a@@ ver .
"H@@ av@@ ing put the produc@@ t into prac@@ tice , we are actually now on the ver@@ ge of sel@@ ling the produc@@ t on@@ to a mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tional to take it to the re@@ tai@@ l market , and one question I have for the au@@ dience today is , on the gra@@ vel ro@@ ad@@ s of L@@ im@@ po@@ po , with an allo@@ wan@@ ce of 50 r@@ and a week , I came up with a way for the world not to ba@@ the ."
What &apos;s sto@@ p@@ ping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
"And another key thing that I learned a lot thro@@ ugh@@ out this whole process , last year Google na@@ med me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young min@@ ds in the world ."
"I &apos;m also cur@@ ren@@ tly the best stu@@ dent en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r in the world , the first Afri@@ can to get that ac@@ col@@ ad@@ e , and one thing that really pu@@ z@@ z@@ les me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to ba@@ the . Thank you ."
( Applause . )
"F@@ i@@ ve years ago , I was on a s@@ ab@@ ba@@ tical , and I re@@ turned to the medi@@ cal uni@@ versity where I stu@@ died ."
"I saw real pati@@ ents and I wor@@ e the wh@@ ite co@@ at for the first time in 1@@ 7 years , in fact since I became a man@@ ag@@ e@@ ment con@@ sul@@ tant ."
There were two things that surpris@@ ed me during the mon@@ th I spent .
"The first one was that the common the@@ me of the dis@@ cus@@ sions we had were hos@@ p@@ ital bu@@ d@@ gets and cos@@ t-@@ cu@@ tting , and the second thing , which really bo@@ ther@@ ed me , actually , was that se@@ ver@@ al of the colle@@ ag@@ ues I met , for@@ mer friends from medi@@ cal school , who I knew to be some of the smar@@ test , most motiv@@ ated , eng@@ ag@@ ed and pas@@ sion@@ ate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned c@@ yn@@ ical , dis@@ eng@@ ag@@ ed , or had dis@@ tan@@ ced themselves from hos@@ p@@ ital man@@ ag@@ e@@ ment ."
"So with this focu@@ s on cos@@ t-@@ cu@@ tting , I asked myself , are we for@@ getting the pati@@ ent ?"
M@@ any countries that you re@@ present and where I come from str@@ ug@@ g@@ le with the cost of heal@@ th@@ care .
It &apos;s a big part of the national bu@@ d@@ gets .
And many different re@@ for@@ ms ai@@ m at h@@ ol@@ ding back this growth .
"In some countries , we have long w@@ ai@@ ting times for pati@@ ents for sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"In other countries , new dru@@ gs are not being re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , and ther@@ e@@ fore don &apos;t re@@ ach pati@@ ents ."
"In se@@ ver@@ al countries , doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses are the tar@@ gets , to some ex@@ tent , for the govern@@ ments ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , the cos@@ tly decis@@ i@@ ons in health care are taken by doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses ."
"You cho@@ ose an ex@@ pen@@ sive la@@ b test , you cho@@ ose to oper@@ ate on an old and fra@@ il pati@@ ent ."
"So , by li@@ mi@@ ting the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom of physi@@ ci@@ ans , this is a way to hold cos@@ ts down ."
"And ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely , some physi@@ ci@@ ans will say today that they don &apos;t have the full li@@ ber@@ ty to make the cho@@ ices they think are right for their pati@@ ents ."
So no won@@ der that some of my old colle@@ ag@@ ues are f@@ rus@@ tra@@ ted .
"A@@ t B@@ C@@ G , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of man@@ ag@@ ing heal@@ th@@ care ."
"And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to ach@@ i@@ eve ? &quot;"
"U@@ l@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely , in the heal@@ th@@ care system , we &apos;re ai@@ ming at impro@@ ving health for the pati@@ ents , and we need to do so at a li@@ mi@@ ted , or af@@ for@@ d@@ able , cost ."
We call this val@@ u@@ e-@@ based heal@@ th@@ care .
"O@@ n the scre@@ en behind me , you see what we mean by val@@ ue : out@@ comes that matter to pati@@ ents rela@@ tive to the money we spend ."
This was descri@@ bed beauti@@ fully in a book in 200@@ 6 by M@@ ich@@ a@@ el P@@ or@@ ter and E@@ liz@@ a@@ be@@ th T@@ eis@@ ber@@ g .
"O@@ n this picture , you have my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by his three beautiful d@@ augh@@ ters ."
"When we started doing our research at B@@ C@@ G , we decided not to look so much at the cos@@ ts , but to look at the qu@@ ality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated us was the vari@@ ation we saw ."
"You com@@ par@@ e hos@@ p@@ it@@ als in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extre@@ me@@ ly good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are vas@@ tly much wor@@ se ."
The differ@@ ences were dra@@ mati@@ c .
"E@@ ri@@ k , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w , he su@@ f@@ fer@@ s from prosta@@ te cancer , and he probably needs sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"Now living in Euro@@ pe , he can cho@@ ose to go to Ger@@ many that has a wel@@ l@@ -@@ re@@ pu@@ ted heal@@ th@@ care system ."
"If he goes there and goes to the a@@ verage hos@@ p@@ ital , he will have the ris@@ k of be@@ coming in@@ contin@@ ent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start w@@ ear@@ ing diap@@ ers again ."
You fli@@ p a co@@ in . F@@ i@@ f@@ ty percent ris@@ k . That &apos;s quite a lot .
"If he instead would go to H@@ am@@ bur@@ g , and to a c@@ lin@@ ic called the Mar@@ tin@@ i@@ -@@ K@@ lin@@ i@@ k , the ris@@ k would be only one in 20 ."
"Ei@@ ther you a fli@@ p a co@@ in , or you have a one in 20 ris@@ k ."
"That &apos;s a huge difference , a se@@ ven@@ -@@ f@@ old difference ."
"When we look at many hos@@ p@@ it@@ als for many different dis@@ eas@@ es , we see these huge differ@@ ences ."
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
"And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exis@@ t ."
No@@ body kno@@ ws .
So going the hos@@ p@@ ital is a l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope ."
"In the late &apos; 7@@ 0s , there were a group of S@@ we@@ dis@@ h orth@@ o@@ pe@@ di@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons who met at their an@@ n@@ ual me@@ e@@ ting , and they were dis@@ cus@@ sing the different pro@@ ce@@ du@@ res they used to oper@@ ate hi@@ p sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"To the left of this sli@@ de , you see a vari@@ e@@ ty of meta@@ l pie@@ ces , arti@@ fici@@ al hi@@ ps that you would use for somebody who needs a new hi@@ p ."
They all realized they had their individu@@ al way of oper@@ ating .
"They all argu@@ ed that , &quot; &quot; My tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e is the best , &quot; &quot; but n@@ one of them actually knew , and they ad@@ mit@@ ted that ."
"So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to measu@@ re qu@@ ality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years de@@ b@@ ating , &quot; So what is qu@@ ality in hi@@ p sur@@ ger@@ y ? &quot;"
"&quot; Oh , we should measu@@ re this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measu@@ re that . &quot;"
And they finally ag@@ re@@ ed .
"And once they had ag@@ re@@ ed , they started measu@@ ring , and started shar@@ ing the data ."
"V@@ er@@ y quickly , they found that if you put ce@@ ment in the b@@ one of the pati@@ ent before you put the meta@@ l s@@ ha@@ ft in , it actually las@@ ted a lot longer , and most pati@@ ents would never have to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on in their li@@ fe@@ time ."
"They pub@@ lis@@ hed the data , and it actually trans@@ for@@ med c@@ lin@@ ical prac@@ tice in the country ."
E@@ very@@ body saw this makes a lot of sense .
"S@@ in@@ ce then , they pub@@ lish every year ."
"O@@ n@@ ce a year , they pub@@ lish the le@@ ag@@ ue table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bot@@ to@@ m ?"
"And they vis@@ it each other to try to learn , so a contin@@ u@@ ous cy@@ cle of impro@@ ve@@ ment ."
"For many years , S@@ we@@ dis@@ h hi@@ p sur@@ ge@@ ons had the best resul@@ ts in the world , at least for those who actually were measu@@ ring , and many were not ."
Now I found this prin@@ ci@@ ple really exci@@ ting .
"So the physi@@ ci@@ ans get together , they ag@@ ree on what qu@@ ality is , they start measu@@ ring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it ."
Con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous impro@@ ve@@ ment .
"Now , that &apos;s not the only exci@@ ting part ."
That &apos;s exci@@ ting in itself .
"But if you bring back the cost side of the equ@@ ation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focu@@ sed on qu@@ ality , they actually also have the lo@@ w@@ est cos@@ ts , al@@ though that &apos;s not been the pur@@ pose in the first place ."
"So if you look at the hi@@ p sur@@ ger@@ y story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they com@@ par@@ ed the U.S. and S@@ we@@ den ."
They looked at how many pati@@ ents have needed to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on seven years after the first sur@@ ger@@ y .
"In the United States , the number was three times high@@ er than in S@@ we@@ den ."
"So many un@@ ne@@ cess@@ ary sur@@ ger@@ ies , and so much un@@ ne@@ cess@@ ary su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing for all the pati@@ ents who were oper@@ ated on in that seven year peri@@ od ."
"Now , you can imagine how much sav@@ ings there would be for society ."
We did a study where we looked at O@@ E@@ C@@ D data .
"O@@ E@@ C@@ D does , every so often , look at qu@@ ality of care where they can find the data across the mem@@ ber countries ."
"The United States has , for many dis@@ eas@@ es , actually a qu@@ ality which is be@@ low the a@@ verage in O@@ E@@ C@@ D ."
"Now , if the American heal@@ th@@ care system would focu@@ s a lot more on measu@@ ring qu@@ ality , and ra@@ ise qu@@ ality just to the level of a@@ verage O@@ E@@ C@@ D , it would sa@@ ve the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year ."
"That &apos;s 20 percent of the bu@@ d@@ get , of the heal@@ th@@ care bu@@ d@@ get of the country ."
"Now you may say that these numbers are fantas@@ tic , and it &apos;s all log@@ ical , but is it possible ?"
"This would be a para@@ dig@@ m shi@@ ft in heal@@ th@@ care , and I would argu@@ e that not only can it be done , but it has to be done ."
The ag@@ ents of change are the doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses in the heal@@ th@@ care system .
"In my prac@@ tice as a con@@ sul@@ tant , I me@@ et probably a hundre@@ d or more than a hundre@@ d doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses and other hos@@ p@@ ital or heal@@ th@@ care sta@@ ff every year ."
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they ach@@ i@@ eve in terms of qu@@ ality for their pati@@ ents .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans are , like most of you in the au@@ dience , very compe@@ ti@@ tive ."
They were always best in clas@@ s .
We were always best in clas@@ s .
"And if somebody can show them that the resul@@ t they per@@ form for their pati@@ ents is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to impro@@ ve ."
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physi@@ ci@@ ans have another charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic .
They actually th@@ ri@@ ve from pe@@ er reco@@ g@@ ni@@ tion .
"If a car@@ dio@@ logis@@ t c@@ alls another car@@ dio@@ logis@@ t in a compe@@ ting hos@@ p@@ ital and dis@@ cus@@ ses why that other hos@@ p@@ ital has so much better resul@@ ts , they will share ."
They will share the information on how to impro@@ ve .
"So it is , by measu@@ ring and cre@@ ating trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy , you get a cy@@ cle of contin@@ u@@ ous impro@@ ve@@ ment , which is what this sli@@ de sho@@ ws ."
"Now , you may say this is a n@@ ice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea ."
This is happening in reality .
"We &apos;re cre@@ ating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to measu@@ re and com@@ par@@ e what we ach@@ i@@ eve ."
"T@@ o@@ gether with two ac@@ ade@@ mic institu@@ tions , M@@ ich@@ a@@ el P@@ or@@ ter at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ in@@ ess S@@ cho@@ ol , and the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ sk@@ a In@@ stitu@@ te in S@@ we@@ den , B@@ C@@ G has for@@ med something we call I@@ C@@ H@@ O@@ M ."
"You may think that &apos;s a s@@ nee@@ ze , but it &apos;s not a s@@ nee@@ ze , it &apos;s an ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m ."
It stan@@ ds for the In@@ ter@@ national Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um for H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ u@@ t@@ come M@@ eas@@ u@@ re@@ ment .
"We &apos;re b@@ rin@@ ging together lead@@ ing physi@@ ci@@ ans and pati@@ ents to dis@@ cus@@ s , disease by disease , what is really qu@@ ality , what should we measu@@ re , and to make those stan@@ dar@@ ds global ."
"They &apos;ve worked — four working gro@@ up@@ s have worked during the past year : c@@ at@@ ar@@ ac@@ ts , back pa@@ in , co@@ ron@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y disease , which is , for in@@ stan@@ ce , heart atta@@ ck , and prosta@@ te cancer ."
The four gro@@ up@@ s will pub@@ lish their data in No@@ ve@@ m@@ ber of this year .
"That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be com@@ par@@ ing ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples , not only within a country , but between countries ."
"N@@ ex@@ t year , we &apos;re plan@@ ning to do eight dis@@ eas@@ es , the year after , 1@@ 6 ."
"In three years &apos; time , we pl@@ an to have co@@ vered 40 percent of the disease bur@@ den ."
C@@ om@@ par@@ e ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples . Wh@@ o &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
"F@@ i@@ ve months ago , I led a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p at the lar@@ gest uni@@ versity hos@@ p@@ ital in Nor@@ ther@@ n Euro@@ pe ."
"They have a new C@@ E@@ O , and she has a vision : I want to man@@ age my big institu@@ tion much more on qu@@ ality , out@@ comes that matter to pati@@ ents ."
"This particular day , we s@@ at in a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p together with physi@@ ci@@ ans , n@@ ur@@ ses and other sta@@ ff , dis@@ cus@@ sing leu@@ ke@@ mia in children ."
"The group dis@@ cus@@ sed , how do we measu@@ re qu@@ ality today ?"
C@@ an we measu@@ re it better than we do ?
"We dis@@ cus@@ sed , how do we tre@@ at these kids , what are important impro@@ ve@@ ments ?"
"And we dis@@ cus@@ sed what are the cos@@ ts for these pati@@ ents , can we do tre@@ at@@ ment more ef@@ fici@@ ently ?"
There was an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous energy in the room .
"There were so many ideas , so much en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m ."
"A@@ t the end of the me@@ e@@ ting , the ch@@ air@@ man of the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment , he sto@@ od up ."
"He looked over the group and he said — first he ra@@ is@@ ed his hand , I for@@ got that — he ra@@ is@@ ed his hand , c@@ len@@ ched his fis@@ t , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
"Th@@ ank you . T@@ o@@ day , we &apos;re finally dis@@ cus@@ sing what this hos@@ p@@ ital does the right way . &quot; &quot; B@@ y measu@@ ring val@@ ue in heal@@ th@@ care , that is not only cos@@ ts but out@@ comes that matter to pati@@ ents , we will make sta@@ ff in hos@@ p@@ it@@ als and el@@ se@@ where in the heal@@ th@@ care system not a problem but an important part of the solution ."
"I believe measu@@ ring val@@ ue in heal@@ th@@ care will bring about a re@@ vol@@ ution , and I &apos;m con@@ vin@@ ced that the f@@ oun@@ der of mo@@ der@@ n me@@ dic@@ ine , the Gre@@ ek H@@ i@@ p@@ po@@ cra@@ tes , who always put the pati@@ ent at the cen@@ ter , he would s@@ mil@@ e in his gra@@ ve ."
Thank you .

I believe that the star@@ tu@@ p organ@@ ization is one of the gre@@ a@@ test for@@ ms to make the world a better place .

I wanted to find out what actually mat@@ ters most for star@@ tu@@ p suc@@ cess .
"And when I gra@@ du@@ ated from colle@@ ge , I started so@@ f@@ tw@@ are companies ."
We learned a lot from those fa@@ il@@ u@@ res .

"U@@ n@@ der@@ ne@@ ath , I was actually de@@ ep@@ ly un@@ happy , in@@ se@@ cu@@ re and fun@@ da@@ men@@ tally fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of other people , of the future , of fa@@ il@@ u@@ re and of the em@@ p@@ ti@@ ness that I felt was within me ."
"I was le@@ av@@ ing a se@@ min@@ ar when it started , hu@@ m@@ ming to myself , fu@@ m@@ b@@ ling with my ba@@ g just as I &apos;d done a hundre@@ d times before , when su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I heard a voice cal@@ m@@ ly ob@@ ser@@ ve , &quot; She is le@@ av@@ ing the room . &quot;"
"I looked around , and there was no one there , but the c@@ lar@@ ity and decis@@ i@@ ven@@ ess of the com@@ ment was un@@ mis@@ ta@@ ka@@ ble ."
&quot; She is open@@ ing the do@@ or . &quot;
This was the beginning . The voice had ar@@ riv@@ ed .
"And the voice per@@ sis@@ ted , days and then we@@ eks of it , on and on , nar@@ ra@@ ting everything I did in the third person ."
&quot; She is going to a le@@ c@@ ture . &quot;
"It was neu@@ tra@@ l , im@@ pas@@ sive and even , after a while , str@@ an@@ ge@@ ly compan@@ ion@@ ate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , al@@ though I did no@@ tice that its cal@@ m ex@@ teri@@ or sometimes sli@@ pped and that it oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red my own u@@ ne@@ x@@ pres@@ sed emo@@ tion ."
"So , for example , if I was ang@@ ry and had to hi@@ de it , which I often did , being very ade@@ pt at con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing how I really felt , then the voice would sound f@@ rus@@ tra@@ ted ."
"A sub@@ tle condi@@ tion@@ ing process had be@@ gu@@ n , the im@@ plic@@ ation that nor@@ mal people don &apos;t hear vo@@ ices and the fact that I did me@@ ant that something was very ser@@ i@@ ously wrong ."
I spent some time telling the colle@@ ge G@@ .@@ P@@ .
"And to be fai@@ r , I was des@@ per@@ ate for inter@@ est and help , and I began to tell him about my str@@ an@@ ge com@@ men@@ ta@@ tor ."
"For example , I was part of a stu@@ dent T@@ V sta@@ tion that bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast news bu@@ l@@ le@@ tin@@ s around the cam@@ p@@ us , and during an ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment which was run@@ ning very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , doc@@ tor , I &apos;ve got to go ."
It was at this point that ev@@ ents began to rap@@ id@@ ly over@@ take me .
"A hos@@ p@@ ital ad@@ mis@@ sion follo@@ wed , the first of many , a diagno@@ sis of sch@@ iz@@ o@@ ph@@ ren@@ ia came next , and then , wor@@ st of all , a to@@ x@@ ic , tor@@ men@@ ting sense of ho@@ pe@@ le@@ ss@@ ness , hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation and des@@ pai@@ r about myself and my pros@@ pe@@ cts ."
"But having been en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ed to see the voice not as an experience but as a sym@@ pto@@ m , my fe@@ ar and res@@ is@@ tance to@@ wards it in@@ ten@@ si@@ fi@@ ed ."
"Now es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally , this re@@ presen@@ ted taking an ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sive stan@@ ce to@@ wards my own mind , a kind of psy@@ chi@@ c civi@@ l war , and in turn this cau@@ sed the number of vo@@ ices to incre@@ ase and grow pro@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vely hos@@ ti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing ."
You see that g@@ las@@ s of water ?
"In effe@@ ct , a v@@ ic@@ i@@ ous cy@@ cle of fe@@ ar , av@@ o@@ id@@ ance , mis@@ tr@@ ust and mis@@ under@@ standing had been es@@ tab@@ lis@@ hed , and this was a bat@@ tle in which I felt power@@ less and in@@ cap@@ able of es@@ tab@@ lis@@ hing any kind of pe@@ ace or re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ."
"T@@ w@@ o years later , and the de@@ teri@@ or@@ ation was dra@@ mati@@ c ."
"B@@ y now , I had the whole f@@ ren@@ zi@@ ed re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re : terri@@ f@@ ying vo@@ ices , gro@@ tes@@ qu@@ e visi@@ ons , b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re , in@@ tra@@ c@@ table de@@ lu@@ sions ."
"Now looking back on the w@@ rec@@ ka@@ ge and des@@ pai@@ r of those years , it see@@ ms to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was sav@@ ed ."
"A bro@@ k@@ en and h@@ au@@ n@@ ted person began that jour@@ ney , but the person who e@@ mer@@ ged was a sur@@ viv@@ or and would ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely grow into the person I was de@@ sti@@ ned to be ."
"M@@ any people have har@@ med me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memor@@ ies grow pal@@ e and fain@@ t in com@@ par@@ is@@ on with the people who &apos;ve hel@@ ped me ."
I believe that E@@ le@@ an@@ or can get through this .
"S@@ ome@@ times , you know , it s@@ no@@ ws as late as M@@ ay , but sum@@ mer always comes ev@@ en@@ tually . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ te@@ en minutes is not enough time to fully cre@@ di@@ t those good and gener@@ ous people who f@@ ou@@ ght with me and for me and who w@@ ai@@ ted to wel@@ come me back from that ag@@ on@@ ized , lon@@ ely place ."
"Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the vo@@ ices appe@@ ar@@ ed so hos@@ ti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing , so in this re@@ spe@@ ct , a v@@ ital first step was learning to se@@ par@@ ate out a me@@ tap@@ hor@@ ical me@@ an@@ ing from what I &apos;d pre@@ vi@@ ously inter@@ pre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al tru@@ th ."
"So for example , vo@@ ices which thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to atta@@ ck my home I learned to inter@@ pre@@ t as my own sense of fe@@ ar and in@@ se@@ cur@@ ity in the world , rather than an ac@@ tual , ob@@ je@@ ctive dang@@ er ."
"Now at first , I would have beli@@ ev@@ ed them ."
"I remember , for example , sitting up one night on gu@@ ard outside my parents &apos; room to prote@@ ct them from what I thought was a gen@@ u@@ ine thre@@ at from the vo@@ ices ."
"It was like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t me@@ ss with me ."
"I &apos;ve got a plas@@ tic for@@ k , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; S@@ tra@@ te@@ gic ."

T@@ ell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to share my photograp@@ h@@ y .
O@@ r is it photograp@@ h@@ y ?
"Because , of course , this is a photograp@@ h that you can &apos;t take with your ca@@ mera ."
"@@ Y@@ et , my inter@@ est in photograp@@ h@@ y started as I got my first digital ca@@ mera at the age of 15 ."
"It mi@@ x@@ ed with my ear@@ li@@ er passion for dra@@ wing , but it was a bit different , because using the ca@@ mera , the process was in the plan@@ ning instead ."
"And when you take a photograp@@ h with a ca@@ mera , the process ends when you pre@@ ss the tri@@ g@@ ger ."
So to me it felt like photograp@@ h@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like any@@ one could do that .
"So I wanted to create something different , something where the process star@@ ts when you pre@@ ss the tri@@ g@@ ger ."
P@@ ho@@ tos like this : con@@ struc@@ tion going on along a bus@@ y ro@@ ad .
But it has an u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted tw@@ ist .
"And de@@ sp@@ ite that , it re@@ tain@@ s a level of real@@ ism ."
"O@@ r pho@@ tos like these — both dar@@ k and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common go@@ al of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of real@@ ism ."
"When I say real@@ ism , I mean photo@@ -@@ real@@ ism ."
"Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tu@@ red some@@ how as a photograp@@ h ."
P@@ ho@@ tos where you will need a bri@@ ef moment to think to figure out the tri@@ ck .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea than about cap@@ tur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the tri@@ ck that makes it look real@@ is@@ tic ?
I@@ s it something about the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s or the col@@ ors ?
I@@ s it something about the light ?
What cre@@ ates the il@@ lu@@ sion ?
S@@ ome@@ times the per@@ spe@@ ctive is the il@@ lu@@ sion .
"But in the end , it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a tw@@ o-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al sur@@ face ."
"It &apos;s not really what is real@@ is@@ tic , it &apos;s what we think looks real@@ is@@ tic really ."
So I think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
I just see it as a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of reality where you can take different pie@@ ces of reality and put it together to create al@@ ter@@ n@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
"@@ Here we have three per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly ima@@ gin@@ able physical ob@@ jects , something we all can rela@@ te to living in a thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al world ."
"But com@@ b@@ ined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al , like it could exis@@ t ."
"But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t ."
"So we tri@@ ck our bra@@ ins , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t ac@@ cept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense ."
And I see the same process with com@@ b@@ in@@ ing photograp@@ h@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about com@@ b@@ in@@ ing different re@@ ali@@ ties .
"So the things that make a photograp@@ h look real@@ is@@ tic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our dai@@ ly lives ."
"But when com@@ b@@ in@@ ing photograp@@ h@@ s , this is really important to consi@@ der , because o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise it just looks wrong some@@ how ."
So I would like to say that there are three simple ru@@ les to fol@@ low to ach@@ i@@ eve a real@@ is@@ tic resul@@ t .
"As you can see , these images ar@@ en &apos;t really speci@@ al ."
"But com@@ b@@ ined , they can create something like this ."
So the first ru@@ le is that pho@@ tos com@@ b@@ ined should have the same per@@ spe@@ ctive .
"S@@ econ@@ dly , pho@@ tos com@@ b@@ ined should have the same ty@@ pe of light ."
And these two images both ful@@ f@@ ill these two re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments — sho@@ t at the same h@@ eight and in the same ty@@ pe of light .
The third one is about making it im@@ possible to dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish where the different images beg@@ in and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
M@@ ake it im@@ possible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed .
"So by mat@@ ching co@@ lor , con@@ tr@@ ast and bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photograp@@ hi@@ c de@@ fe@@ cts like de@@ p@@ th of field , de@@ sa@@ tu@@ ra@@ ted col@@ ors and no@@ ise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , de@@ sp@@ ite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundre@@ ds of la@@ y@@ ers basically ."
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e and the lo@@ wer part is what &apos;s man@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ ted .
But this image is actually enti@@ re@@ ly com@@ posed of photograp@@ h@@ s from different lo@@ c@@ ations .
"I person@@ ally think that it &apos;s eas@@ i@@ er to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ pro@@ mis@@ e with the ideas in your head ."
But it does re@@ qui@@ re a lot of plan@@ ning .
"And getting this idea during win@@ ter , I knew that I had se@@ ver@@ al months to pl@@ an it , to find the different lo@@ c@@ ations for the pie@@ ces of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le basically ."
"So for example , the fish was cap@@ tu@@ red on a fis@@ hing tri@@ p ."
The shor@@ es are from a different lo@@ c@@ ation .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tu@@ red in a sto@@ ne p@@ it .
"And ye@@ ah , I even turned the house on top of the is@@ land red to make it look more S@@ we@@ dis@@ h ."
"So to ach@@ i@@ eve a real@@ is@@ tic resul@@ t , I think it comes down to plan@@ ning ."
"It always star@@ ts with a s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch , an idea ."
Th@@ en it &apos;s about com@@ b@@ in@@ ing the different photograp@@ h@@ s .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
"And if you do a good job cap@@ tur@@ ing the pho@@ tos , the resul@@ t can be quite beautiful and also quite real@@ is@@ tic ."
"So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our ima@@ gin@@ ation ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
This is the sort of behavior that af@@ fe@@ cts all of us .
"For us at G@@ lo@@ bal W@@ it@@ ness , this is a moment for change ."
"@@ Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : J@@ u@@ li@@ an , wel@@ come ."
"It &apos;s been re@@ por@@ ted that W@@ iki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s , your bab@@ y , has , in the last few years has rele@@ as@@ ed more clas@@ si@@ fi@@ ed do@@ cu@@ ments than the rest of the world &apos;s media com@@ b@@ ined ."
C@@ an that possi@@ bly be true ?
"@@ J@@ u@@ li@@ an A@@ ss@@ an@@ ge : Yeah , can it possi@@ bly be true ?"
It &apos;s a wor@@ ry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ ts is able to rele@@ ase more of that ty@@ pe of information than the rest of the world pre@@ ss com@@ b@@ ined .
C@@ A : How does it work ?
How do people rele@@ ase the do@@ cu@@ ments ?
And how do you se@@ cu@@ re their p@@ riv@@ ac@@ y ?
"@@ J@@ A : So these are — as far as we can tell — clas@@ si@@ cal wh@@ is@@ t@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us ."
"So we use this sta@@ te@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art en@@ c@@ ry@@ ption to b@@ oun@@ ce stuff around the Internet , to hi@@ de tra@@ il@@ s , pas@@ s it through leg@@ al ju@@ ris@@ dic@@ tions like S@@ we@@ den and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those leg@@ al prote@@ ctions ."
"We get information in the ma@@ il , the re@@ gu@@ lar po@@ sta@@ l ma@@ il , en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted or not , ve@@ t it like a re@@ gu@@ lar news organ@@ ization , forma@@ t it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about gi@@ ant da@@ ta@@ bas@@ es of information — rele@@ ase it to the public and then de@@ f@@ end ourselves against the in@@ ev@@ it@@ able leg@@ al and political atta@@ cks ."
"C@@ A : So you make an ef@@ for@@ t to en@@ sure the do@@ cu@@ ments are le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate , but you actually almost never know who the identi@@ ty of the sour@@ ce is ?"
"@@ J@@ A : That &apos;s right , ye@@ ah . V@@ er@@ y r@@ are@@ ly do we ever know , and if we find out at some sta@@ ge then we de@@ st@@ roy that information as so@@ on as possible ."
( P@@ h@@ one ring ) God d@@ am@@ n it .
( Laughter ) C@@ A : I think that &apos;s the C@@ I@@ A as@@ king what the co@@ de is for a TED mem@@ ber@@ ship . ( Laughter )
"So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually ."
This is something you le@@ ak@@ ed a few years ago .
If we can have this do@@ cu@@ ment up ...
So this was a story in Ken@@ y@@ a a few years ago .
C@@ an you tell us what you le@@ ak@@ ed and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ ro@@ ll Re@@ port .
This was a se@@ cre@@ t intel@@ li@@ gence re@@ port com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed by the Ken@@ y@@ an government after its ele@@ ction in 200@@ 4 .
"P@@ ri@@ or to 200@@ 4 , Ken@@ y@@ a was ru@@ led by D@@ an@@ i@@ el ar@@ ap M@@ oi for about 1@@ 8 years ."
He was a so@@ ft dic@@ ta@@ tor of Ken@@ y@@ a .
"And when K@@ i@@ b@@ aki got into power — through a co@@ ali@@ tion of for@@ ces that were trying to cle@@ an up cor@@ ru@@ ption in Ken@@ y@@ a — they com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed this re@@ port , spent about two million po@@ un@@ ds on this and an as@@ soci@@ ated re@@ port ."
"And then the government s@@ at on it and used it for political le@@ verage on M@@ oi , who was the ri@@ ch@@ est man — still is the ri@@ ch@@ est man — in Ken@@ y@@ a ."
It &apos;s the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il of Ken@@ y@@ an jour@@ n@@ alis@@ m .
"So I went there in 200@@ 7 , and we man@@ ag@@ ed to get hold of this just pri@@ or to the ele@@ ction — the national ele@@ ction , De@@ c@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 8 ."
"When we rele@@ as@@ ed that re@@ port , we did so three days after the new pre@@ si@@ dent , K@@ i@@ b@@ aki , had decided to p@@ al up with the man that he was going to cle@@ an out , D@@ an@@ i@@ el ar@@ ap M@@ oi , so this re@@ port then became a de@@ ad al@@ ba@@ tro@@ ss around P@@ re@@ si@@ dent K@@ i@@ b@@ aki &apos;s ne@@ ck ."
"C@@ A : And — I mean , to c@@ ut a long story shor@@ t — word of the re@@ port le@@ ak@@ ed into Ken@@ y@@ a , not from the of@@ fici@@ al media , but in@@ direc@@ tly , and in your op@@ in@@ ion , it actually shi@@ f@@ ted the ele@@ ction ."
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . So this became front p@@ age of the G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an and was then prin@@ ted in all the sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding countries of Ken@@ y@@ a , in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ian and S@@ outh Afri@@ can pre@@ ss ."
And so it came in from the outside .
"And that , after a couple of days , made the Ken@@ y@@ an pre@@ ss feel saf@@ e to talk about it ."
"And it ran for 20 ni@@ ghts stra@@ i@@ ght on Ken@@ y@@ an T@@ V , shi@@ f@@ ted the v@@ ote by 10 percent , ac@@ cor@@ ding to a Ken@@ y@@ an intel@@ li@@ gence re@@ port , which changed the resul@@ t of the ele@@ ction ."
"C@@ A : W@@ ow , so your le@@ ak really sub@@ st@@ anti@@ ally changed the world ?"
J@@ A : Y@@ ep .
( Applause ) C@@ A : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a shor@@ t cli@@ p from this B@@ ag@@ h@@ d@@ ad air@@ str@@ ike video .
"The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a shor@@ t cli@@ p ."
"This is — this is in@@ ten@@ se materi@@ al , I should war@@ n you ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ dio : ... just fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; , once you get on &apos; e@@ m just open &apos; e@@ m up ."
"I see your ele@@ ment , u@@ h , got about four H@@ u@@ mv@@ e@@ es , u@@ h , out along ..@@ ."
You &apos;re cle@@ ar . All right . F@@ ir@@ ing .
Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s sho@@ ot .

"H@@ ot@@ el ... B@@ us@@ h@@ mas@@ ter T@@ wo@@ -@@ Si@@ x , B@@ us@@ h@@ mas@@ ter T@@ wo@@ -@@ Si@@ x ,"
"@@ we need to move , time now !"
"A@@ ll right , we just eng@@ ag@@ ed all eight individu@@ als ."
"@@ Yeah , we see two bir@@ ds &#91; he@@ li@@ co@@ p@@ ters &#93; , and we &apos;re still fir@@ ing ."
R@@ og@@ er . I got &apos; e@@ m .
"T@@ wo@@ -@@ Si@@ x , this is T@@ wo@@ -@@ Si@@ x , we &apos;re mo@@ bil@@ e ."
"O@@ op@@ s , I &apos;m sor@@ ry . What was going on ?"
"G@@ od d@@ am@@ n it , K@@ y@@ le . All right , ha@@ ha@@ h@@ a . I h@@ it &apos; e@@ m ."
"C@@ A : So , what was the imp@@ act of that ?"
J@@ A : The imp@@ act on the people who worked on it was se@@ v@@ ere .
We en@@ ded up sen@@ ding two people to B@@ ag@@ h@@ d@@ ad to fu@@ r@@ ther research that story .
So this is just the first of three atta@@ cks that oc@@ cur@@ red in that s@@ cen@@ e .
"C@@ A : So , I mean , 11 people died in that atta@@ ck , right , inclu@@ ding two R@@ eu@@ ters em@@ ploy@@ e@@ es ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . T@@ w@@ o R@@ eu@@ ters em@@ ploy@@ e@@ es , two young children were w@@ oun@@ ded ."
There were between 1@@ 8 and 2@@ 6 people kil@@ led all together .
C@@ A : And rele@@ as@@ ing this cau@@ sed w@@ ide@@ spre@@ ad out@@ rag@@ e .
"What was the key ele@@ ment of this that actually cau@@ sed the out@@ rag@@ e , do you think ?"
J@@ A : I don &apos;t know . I gu@@ ess people can see the gro@@ ss dis@@ par@@ ity in for@@ ce .
"You have guys wal@@ king in a rela@@ x@@ ed way down the stre@@ et , and then an A@@ pa@@ ch@@ e he@@ li@@ co@@ p@@ ter sitting up at one ki@@ lo@@ me@@ ter fir@@ ing 3@@ 0@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ me@@ ter can@@ n@@ on sh@@ el@@ ls on everyone — looking for any ex@@ cu@@ se to do so — and kil@@ ling people res@@ cu@@ ing the w@@ oun@@ ded ."
And there was two jour@@ n@@ alis@@ ts invol@@ ved that c@@ lear@@ ly wer@@ en &apos;t in@@ sur@@ gen@@ ts because that &apos;s their ful@@ l@@ -@@ time job .
"C@@ A : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intel@@ li@@ gence analy@@ st , Bra@@ d@@ le@@ y Man@@ ning , ar@@ res@@ ted , and it &apos;s al@@ leg@@ ed that he con@@ fes@@ sed in a ch@@ at room to have le@@ ak@@ ed this video to you , along with 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 clas@@ si@@ fi@@ ed U.S. em@@ bas@@ s@@ y c@@ ab@@ les ."
"I mean , did he ?"
J@@ A : We have den@@ i@@ ed rec@@ ei@@ ving those c@@ ab@@ les .
"He has been char@@ ged , about five days ago , with ob@@ tain@@ ing 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 c@@ ab@@ les and rele@@ as@@ ing 50 ."
"Now , we had rele@@ as@@ ed , early in the year , a c@@ able from the R@@ eyk@@ j@@ a@@ vi@@ k U.S. em@@ bas@@ s@@ y , but this is not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly conne@@ cted ."
"I mean , I was a known visi@@ tor of that em@@ bas@@ s@@ y ."
"C@@ A : I mean , if you did rec@@ ei@@ ve thousands of U.S. em@@ bas@@ s@@ y diplo@@ mati@@ c c@@ ab@@ les ..@@ ."
"@@ J@@ A : We would have rele@@ as@@ ed them . ( C@@ A : You would ? ) J@@ A : Yeah . ( C@@ A : Because ? ) J@@ A : Well , because these sort of things re@@ ve@@ al what the true state of , say , A@@ ra@@ b govern@@ ments are like , the true human@@ -@@ ri@@ ghts ab@@ us@@ es in those govern@@ ments ."
"If you look at dec@@ las@@ si@@ fi@@ ed c@@ ab@@ les , that &apos;s the sort of materi@@ al that &apos;s there ."
C@@ A : So let &apos;s talk a little more bro@@ ad@@ ly about this .
"I mean , in gener@@ al , what &apos;s your ph@@ i@@ loso@@ ph@@ y ?"
Why is it right to en@@ cou@@ rag@@ e le@@ aking of se@@ cre@@ t information ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can ach@@ i@@ eve re@@ form ."
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
"So information that organ@@ iz@@ ations are spen@@ ding economic ef@@ for@@ t into con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing , that &apos;s a really good sig@@ n@@ al that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organ@@ iz@@ ations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spen@@ ding work to con@@ ce@@ al it ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in prac@@ tice , and that &apos;s what the history of jour@@ n@@ alis@@ m is ."
"C@@ A : But are there ris@@ ks with that , either to the individu@@ als con@@ cer@@ ned or in@@ de@@ ed to society at large , where le@@ aking can actually have an un@@ in@@ ten@@ ded con@@ sequ@@ ence ?"
J@@ A : N@@ ot that we have seen with anything we have rele@@ as@@ ed .
"I mean , we have a har@@ m im@@ m@@ un@@ ization poli@@ cy ."
We have a way of de@@ al@@ ing with information that has sort of person@@ al — person@@ ally identi@@ f@@ ying information in it .
"But there are le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate se@@ cre@@ ts — you know , your recor@@ ds with your doc@@ tor ; that &apos;s a le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate se@@ cre@@ t — but we deal with wh@@ is@@ t@@ le@@ blo@@ wers that are coming forward that are really sort of wel@@ l@@ -@@ motiv@@ ated ."
C@@ A : So they are wel@@ l@@ -@@ motiv@@ ated .
"And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the par@@ ent of someone wh@@ ose son is out ser@@ ving the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an in@@ cen@@ tive to put out ."
It sho@@ ws a U.S. sol@@ di@@ er l@@ augh@@ ing at people dy@@ ing .
"That gi@@ ves the im@@ pres@@ sion , has given the im@@ pres@@ sion , to mil@@ lions of people around the world that U.S. sol@@ di@@ ers are in@@ human people ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How d@@ are you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , we do get a lot of that ."
"But remember , the people in B@@ ag@@ h@@ d@@ ad , the people in I@@ ra@@ q , the people in Af@@ gh@@ anis@@ tan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day ."
So it &apos;s not going to change their op@@ in@@ ion . It &apos;s not going to change their per@@ cep@@ tion .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
"It will change the per@@ cep@@ tion and op@@ in@@ ion of the people who are pa@@ ying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope ."
C@@ A : So you found a way to sh@@ ine light into what you see as these sort of dar@@ k se@@ cre@@ ts in companies and in government .
Li@@ ght is good .
"But do you see any i@@ ron@@ y in the fact that , in order for you to sh@@ ine that light , you have to , yourself , create se@@ cre@@ cy around your sour@@ ces ?"
"@@ J@@ A : N@@ ot really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any W@@ iki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s dis@@ si@@ dents yet ."
We don &apos;t have sour@@ ces who are dis@@ si@@ dents on other sour@@ ces .
"S@@ h@@ ould they come forward , that would be a tri@@ ck@@ y sit@@ u@@ ation for us , but we &apos;re pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly ac@@ ting in such a way that people feel mor@@ ally compe@@ l@@ led to contin@@ ue our mis@@ sion , not to scre@@ w it up ."
"C@@ A : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous as to the op@@ in@@ ion in the TED au@@ dience ."
"You know , there might be a couple of vie@@ ws of W@@ iki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s and of J@@ u@@ li@@ an ."
"You know , her@@ o — people &apos;s her@@ o — b@@ rin@@ ging this important light ."
D@@ ang@@ er@@ ous tro@@ u@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er .
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the her@@ o view ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the dang@@ er@@ ous tro@@ u@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er view ?
"@@ J@@ A : Oh , come on . There must be some ."
"C@@ A : It &apos;s a so@@ ft cro@@ w@@ d , J@@ u@@ li@@ an , a so@@ ft cro@@ w@@ d ."
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
"Now here &apos;s something that you ha@@ ven &apos;t yet le@@ ak@@ ed , but I think for TED you are ."
"I mean it &apos;s an in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?"
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a s@@ am@@ ple of what we do sort of every day .
"So late last year — in No@@ ve@@ m@@ ber last year — there was a ser@@ ies of well blo@@ w@@ ou@@ ts in Al@@ ban@@ ia , like the well blo@@ w@@ out in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , but not quite as big ."
"And we got a re@@ port — a sort of engine@@ er@@ ing analy@@ sis into what happened — saying that , in fact , se@@ cur@@ ity gu@@ ar@@ ds from some riv@@ al , vari@@ ous compe@@ ting o@@ il fir@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked tr@@ uc@@ ks there and blo@@ wn them up ."
"And part of the Al@@ ban@@ ian government was in this , e@@ t@@ c . , e@@ t@@ c ."
"And the engine@@ er@@ ing re@@ port had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extre@@ me@@ ly difficult do@@ cu@@ ment for us ."
We couldn &apos;t ver@@ i@@ f@@ y it because we didn &apos;t know who w@@ ro@@ te it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of skep@@ tical that maybe it was a compe@@ ting o@@ il fir@@ m just sort of pla@@ ying the issu@@ e up .
"So under that bas@@ is , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , we &apos;re skep@@ tical about this thing ."
"We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?"
"The materi@@ al looks good , it feel@@ s right , but we just can &apos;t ver@@ i@@ f@@ y it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a le@@ tter just this week from the company who w@@ ro@@ te it , wan@@ ting to tra@@ ck down the sour@@ ce — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , we want to tra@@ ck down the sour@@ ce . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more ."
"What do@@ cu@@ ment is it , pre@@ c@@ is@@ ely , you &apos;re talking about ?"
C@@ an you show that you had leg@@ al au@@ thor@@ ity over that do@@ cu@@ ment ?
I@@ s it really y@@ ours ? &quot; &quot; So they s@@ ent us this scre@@ en sho@@ t with the au@@ th@@ or in the M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft Wor@@ d I@@ D .
Yeah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
"This is like one of our meth@@ ods of identi@@ f@@ ying , of ver@@ i@@ f@@ ying , what a materi@@ al is , is to try and get these guys to write le@@ t@@ ters ."
C@@ A : Yeah . H@@ ave you had information from inside B@@ P ?
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are under@@ going a sort of ser@@ i@@ ous fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing and engine@@ er@@ ing ef@@ for@@ t ."
So our pub@@ li@@ c@@ ation rate over the past few months has been sort of min@@ i@@ miz@@ ed while we &apos;re re@@ -@@ engine@@ er@@ ing our back systems for the ph@@ en@@ omen@@ al public inter@@ est that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
"I mean , like any sort of growing star@@ tu@@ p organ@@ ization , we are sort of over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting en@@ or@@ m@@ ous qu@@ anti@@ ty of wh@@ is@@ t@@ le@@ blo@@ wer dis@@ clo@@ sur@@ es of a very high cal@@ i@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and ve@@ t this information ."
"C@@ A : So that &apos;s the key bot@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ ck , basically jour@@ n@@ alis@@ tic vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and / or the fun@@ ding of jour@@ n@@ alis@@ tic sal@@ ar@@ ies ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ ep . Yeah , and tr@@ us@@ ted people ."
"I mean , we &apos;re an organ@@ ization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of materi@@ al we deal with , so we have to re@@ struc@@ ture in order to have people who will deal with the high@@ est national se@@ cur@@ ity stuff , and then lo@@ wer se@@ cur@@ ity cas@@ es ."
C@@ A : So help us understand a bit about you person@@ ally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a ki@@ d you went to 3@@ 7 different scho@@ ols .
C@@ an that be right ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , my parents were in the movi@@ e business and then on the run from a cul@@ t , so the com@@ b@@ in@@ ation between the two ..@@ ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A : I mean , a psy@@ cho@@ logis@@ t might say that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ pe for bre@@ e@@ ding par@@ ano@@ ia ."
"@@ J@@ A : What , the movi@@ e business ?"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) C@@ A : And you were also — I mean , you were also a h@@ ac@@ ker at an early age and ran into the au@@ thor@@ i@@ ties early on ."
"@@ J@@ A : Well , I was a jour@@ n@@ alis@@ t ."
"You know , I was a very young jour@@ n@@ alis@@ t ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ t at an early age ."
"I w@@ ro@@ te a mag@@ az@@ ine , was prose@@ cu@@ ted for it when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er ."
So you have to be care@@ ful with h@@ ac@@ ker .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a meth@@ od that can be de@@ ploy@@ ed for vari@@ ous things .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ na@@ tely , at the moment , it &apos;s mo@@ st@@ ly de@@ ploy@@ ed by the R@@ us@@ si@@ an ma@@ fia in order to ste@@ al your grand@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts ."
"So this ph@@ ras@@ e is not , not as n@@ ice as it used to be ."
"C@@ A : Yeah , well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ al@@ ing any@@ one &apos;s grand@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t , but what about your cor@@ e val@@ ues ?"
C@@ an you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some in@@ ci@@ dent in your life that hel@@ ped de@@ ter@@ min@@ e them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure about the in@@ ci@@ dent .
"But the cor@@ e val@@ ues : well , cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ."
"And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men that have been in my life ."
"C@@ A : C@@ ap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a com@@ ba@@ tive person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the n@@ ur@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , which is to poli@@ ce per@@ pe@@ tra@@ tors of cri@@ me ."
And so that is something that has been in my charac@@ ter for a long time .
"C@@ A : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minu@@ te , the story : what happened in I@@ cel@@ and ?"
"You basically pub@@ lis@@ hed something there , ran into tro@@ u@@ ble with a b@@ ank , then the news serv@@ ice there was in@@ j@@ un@@ cted from run@@ ning the story ."
"In@@ stead , they pub@@ li@@ ci@@ z@@ ed your side ."
That made you very high@@ -@@ pro@@ fil@@ e in I@@ cel@@ and . What happened next ?
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , this is a great case , you know ."
I@@ cel@@ and went through this fin@@ an@@ cial c@@ risis .
It was the har@@ de@@ st h@@ it of any country in the world .
I@@ ts ban@@ king se@@ c@@ tor was 10 times the G@@ D@@ P of the rest of the economy .
"A@@ ny@@ way , so we rele@@ ase this re@@ port in J@@ u@@ ly last year ."
"And the national T@@ V sta@@ tion was in@@ j@@ un@@ cted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movi@@ e : in@@ j@@ un@@ ction lan@@ ded on the news des@@ k , and the news re@@ a@@ der was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;"
"Well , we just show the w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite instead , for all that time , as a fil@@ ler , and we became very f@@ am@@ ous in I@@ cel@@ and , went to I@@ cel@@ and and spo@@ ke about this issu@@ e ."
"And there was a feel@@ ing in the community that that should never happen again , and as a resul@@ t , working with I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans and some other inter@@ national leg@@ al ex@@ per@@ ts , we put together a new sort of p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ge of leg@@ is@@ lation for I@@ cel@@ and to sort of become an off@@ shor@@ e ha@@ ven for the free pre@@ ss , with the st@@ ron@@ gest jour@@ n@@ alis@@ tic prote@@ ctions in the world , with a new No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ e@@ ch ."
"I@@ cel@@ and &apos;s a Nor@@ di@@ c country , so , like Nor@@ way , it &apos;s able to ta@@ p into the system ."
"And just a mon@@ th ago , this was pas@@ sed by the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ a@@ ment un@@ anim@@ ously ."
C@@ A : W@@ ow .
"( Applause ) L@@ ast question , J@@ u@@ li@@ an ."
"When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more lik@@ ely to be B@@ i@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther ex@@ er@@ ting more control , more se@@ cre@@ cy , or us wat@@ ching B@@ i@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther , or it &apos;s just all to be play@@ ed for either way ?"
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
"I mean , there &apos;s en@@ or@@ m@@ ous pres@@ sur@@ es to har@@ mon@@ ize fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ e@@ ch leg@@ is@@ lation and trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy leg@@ is@@ lation around the world — within the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , between China and the United States ."
Wh@@ ich way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
"That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of ef@@ for@@ t , we can shi@@ ft it one way or the other ."
"C@@ A : Well , it looks like I &apos;m re@@ fle@@ cting the au@@ dience &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion to say , J@@ u@@ li@@ an , be care@@ ful , and all power to you ."
"@@ J@@ A : Thank you , Ch@@ ris . ( C@@ A : Thank you . ) ( Applause )"
"As a matter of fact , I was trying to think about my care@@ er since I left the Wh@@ ite H@@ ouse , and the best example I have is a car@@ to@@ on in The New Yor@@ ker a couple of years ago ."
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , when I grow up , I want to be a for@@ mer pre@@ si@@ dent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great b@@ le@@ ss@@ ing as a for@@ mer pre@@ si@@ dent , because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"N@@ ot only am I fami@@ li@@ ar with the 50 sta@@ tes in the United States , but also my wi@@ fe and I have visi@@ ted more than 1@@ 4@@ 5 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter has had ful@@ l@@ -@@ time progra@@ ms in 80 na@@ tions on Earth ."
"So our over@@ all comm@@ it@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is to pro@@ m@@ ote human ri@@ ghts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any e@@ qui@@ vo@@ c@@ ation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ ghts on Earth is , str@@ an@@ ge@@ ly , not ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed quite often , is the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to beg@@ in with .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all is the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation of reli@@ gi@@ ous s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures , ho@@ ly s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures , in the B@@ i@@ ble , O@@ ld T@@ es@@ ta@@ ment , New T@@ es@@ ta@@ ment , Q@@ ur@@ an and so for@@ th , and these have been mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant posi@@ tions in the syn@@ ag@@ o@@ gu@@ es and the ch@@ u@@ rch@@ es and in the mo@@ squ@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these ru@@ les to make sure that women are ordin@@ ari@@ ly re@@ leg@@ ated to a secon@@ d@@ ary posi@@ tion com@@ par@@ ed to men in the eyes of God .
This is a very ser@@ i@@ ous problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ ari@@ ly not ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed .
But the bas@@ ic thing is the s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures are mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant posi@@ tion .
"That is an all@@ -@@ per@@ vas@@ i@@ ve problem , because men can ex@@ er@@ t that power and if an ab@@ u@@ sive h@@ us@@ b@@ and or an em@@ ploy@@ er , for in@@ stan@@ ce , wan@@ ts to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equ@@ al in the eyes of God , why should I tre@@ at them as equ@@ als myself ?"
Why should I p@@ ay them equ@@ al p@@ ay for doing the same kind of work ?
"The other very ser@@ i@@ ous b@@ light that cau@@ ses this problem is the ex@@ ces@@ sive res@@ or@@ t to violence , and that is incre@@ as@@ ing tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously around the world ."
"When I was in off@@ ice as go@@ ver@@ no@@ r of G@@ e@@ or@@ gia , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans were in pris@@ on ."
"N@@ ow@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pris@@ on ."
That &apos;s a se@@ ven@@ f@@ old incre@@ ase .
And we ran@@ k right alon@@ g@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ u@@ sive in all ele@@ ments of human ri@@ ghts in en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ing the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it cos@@ ts C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia to sen@@ d a person to be exe@@ cu@@ ted ."
"L@@ et me just go down a very few ab@@ us@@ es of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fai@@ r@@ ly bri@@ ef , because I have a li@@ mi@@ ted amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ lation .
"And sometimes , in more extre@@ me cas@@ es but not very r@@ are cas@@ es , they se@@ w the or@@ i@@ f@@ ice up so the girl can just u@@ rin@@ ate or men@@ str@@ u@@ ate ."
"This is not a r@@ are thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ gy@@ pt , for in@@ stan@@ ce , 9@@ 1 percent of all the fe@@ mal@@ es that live in E@@ gy@@ pt today have been sex@@ u@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ la@@ ted in that way ."
This is a hor@@ ri@@ ble af@@ fli@@ ction on all women that live in those countries .
"And this is done by mem@@ bers of her own family , so the family be@@ comes mu@@ r@@ der@@ ers when the girl b@@ rin@@ gs so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gra@@ ce to the family ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that rela@@ tes to women particu@@ lar@@ ly is s@@ la@@ very , or human tra@@ f@@ fic@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people sol@@ d from Africa into s@@ la@@ very in the New Wor@@ ld back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now living in s@@ la@@ very .
"The United States D@@ ep@@ ar@@ t@@ ment of Sta@@ te now has a man@@ d@@ ate from Con@@ gre@@ ss to give a re@@ port every year , and the Sta@@ te D@@ ep@@ ar@@ t@@ ment re@@ por@@ ts that 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people are sol@@ d across inter@@ national bor@@ ders every year into s@@ la@@ very , and that 80 percent of those sol@@ d are women , into sex@@ ual s@@ la@@ very ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are living in human b@@ on@@ d@@ age , or s@@ la@@ very ."
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ gia , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is lo@@ c@@ ated and where I te@@ ach at E@@ mor@@ y Uni@@ versity , they have between 200 and 3@@ 00 women , people sol@@ d into s@@ la@@ very every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the n@@ ation because of that .
"If a bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner wan@@ ts to bu@@ y a girl that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ ite@@ -@@ skin@@ ned girl b@@ rin@@ gs se@@ ver@@ al times more than that , and the a@@ verage bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per s@@ la@@ ve ."
"The sex tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ gia , ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds the to@@ tal dru@@ g tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ gia ."
S@@ we@@ den has got a good appro@@ ach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , S@@ we@@ den decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer prose@@ cu@@ ted if they are in sex@@ ual s@@ la@@ very , but the bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ners and the pi@@ m@@ ps and the mal@@ e cus@@ to@@ mers are prose@@ cu@@ ted , and — ( Applause ) — pro@@ stitu@@ tion has gone down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite posi@@ tion ."
"For every mal@@ e ar@@ res@@ ted for il@@ leg@@ al sex tra@@ de , 25 women are ar@@ res@@ ted in the United States of America ."
"In the mil@@ it@@ ary , they are now analy@@ z@@ ing how many sex@@ ual as@@ s@@ au@@ l@@ ts take place ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually prose@@ cu@@ ted , and the reason is that the com@@ man@@ ding of@@ fic@@ er of any organ@@ ization — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a bat@@ tal@@ ion in the Ar@@ my or a company in the Mar@@ ines — the com@@ man@@ ding of@@ fic@@ er has the right under la@@ w to deci@@ de whether to prose@@ cu@@ te a rap@@ ist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their comm@@ and , sex@@ ual as@@ s@@ au@@ l@@ ts are taking place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w needs to be changed .
They &apos;re not prose@@ cu@@ ted .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very ser@@ i@@ ous about the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls is the l@@ ack of equ@@ al p@@ ay for equ@@ al work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is sometimes mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted , but for ful@@ l@@ -@@ time em@@ ploy@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I became pre@@ si@@ dent , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the For@@ tu@@ ne 500 companies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 500 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an a@@ verage than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like n@@ ation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d Wor@@ ld W@@ ar .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground fi@@ gh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been fl@@ ying over@@ head dro@@ p@@ ping b@@ om@@ bs on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have d@@ ron@@ es that atta@@ ck people and so for@@ th ."
We &apos;ve been at war with 25 different countries or more since the S@@ econ@@ d Wor@@ ld W@@ ar .
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the res@@ or@@ t to violence and the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation of the ho@@ ly s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures are what cau@@ ses , are the bas@@ ic cau@@ ses , of ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls ."
"There &apos;s one more bas@@ ic cause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a d@@ am@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The a@@ verage man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls qui@@ e@@ tly ac@@ cep@@ ts the pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed posi@@ tion that we oc@@ cu@@ py , and this is very si@@ mil@@ ar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ par@@ ate but equ@@ al had exis@@ ted ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation against gir@@ ls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ j@@ oy a pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed posi@@ tion ."
So what is the bas@@ ic thing that we need to do today ?
"I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful na@@ tions like this one , and where you come from , Euro@@ pe and so for@@ th , who have in@@ flu@@ ence and who have fre@@ e@@ dom to speak and to act , need to take the respon@@ si@@ bility on y@@ ourselves to be more for@@ ce@@ ful in de@@ man@@ ding an end to ra@@ cial dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation against gir@@ ls and women all over the world ."
The a@@ verage woman in E@@ gy@@ pt doesn &apos;t have much to say about her d@@ augh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ la@@ ted and so for@@ th .
"But I hope that out of this con@@ fer@@ ence , that every woman here will get your h@@ us@@ b@@ ands to realize that these ab@@ us@@ es on the colle@@ ge cam@@ pus@@ es and the mil@@ it@@ ary and so for@@ th and in the future job market , need to prote@@ ct your d@@ augh@@ ters and your gran@@ dd@@ augh@@ ters ."

One is an A@@ ch@@ eu@@ le@@ an hand ax@@ e from half a million years ago of the kind made by H@@ om@@ o ere@@ c@@ tu@@ s .
The other is obvi@@ ously a computer m@@ ouse .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shap@@ e to an un@@ can@@ n@@ y de@@ gre@@ e .
"I &apos;ve tried to work out which is big@@ ger , and it &apos;s almost im@@ possible ."
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both desig@@ ned to f@@ it the human hand .
"They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ity is not that interesting ."
It just tel@@ ls you they were both desig@@ ned to f@@ it the human hand .
"The differ@@ ences are what inter@@ est me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty un@@ var@@ ying design for about a million years — from on@@ e-@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half million years ago to half a million years ago ."
"H@@ om@@ o ere@@ c@@ tu@@ s made the same to@@ ol for 3@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations ."
"O@@ f course there were a few changes , but tools changed s@@ lo@@ wer than s@@ ke@@ le@@ ton@@ s in those days ."
"There was no pro@@ gre@@ ss , no innov@@ ation ."
"It &apos;s an extra@@ ordin@@ ary ph@@ en@@ omenon , but it &apos;s true ."
Wh@@ ere@@ as the ob@@ ject on the right is ob@@ so@@ le@@ te after five years .
"And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the ob@@ ject on the left is made from one sub@@ stan@@ ce ."
"The ob@@ ject on the right is made from a con@@ fe@@ ction of different sub@@ stan@@ ces , from si@@ li@@ c@@ on and meta@@ l and plas@@ tic and so on ."
"And more than that , it &apos;s a con@@ fe@@ ction of different ideas , the idea of plas@@ tic , the idea of a las@@ er , the idea of trans@@ istor@@ s ."
They &apos;ve all been com@@ b@@ ined together in this technology .
"And it &apos;s this com@@ b@@ in@@ ation , this cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive technology , that in@@ tri@@ gu@@ es me , because I think it &apos;s the se@@ cre@@ t to under@@ standing what &apos;s happening in the world ."
"My body &apos;s an ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ lation of ideas too : the idea of sk@@ in cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of li@@ ver cells ."
They &apos;ve come together .
"@@ How does evol@@ ution do cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive , com@@ b@@ in@@ ato@@ ri@@ al things ?"
"Well , it us@@ es sex@@ ual re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"In an as@@ ex@@ ual species , if you get two different mu@@ ta@@ tions in different crea@@ tures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other ."
One goes ex@@ tin@@ ct for the other to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
"But if you have a sex@@ ual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individu@@ al to in@@ her@@ it both mu@@ ta@@ tions from different lin@@ e@@ ages ."
So what sex does is it en@@ ab@@ les the individu@@ al to dra@@ w upo@@ n the gene@@ tic innov@@ ations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not con@@ fin@@ ed to its own lin@@ e@@ age .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effe@@ ct in cul@@ tural evol@@ ution as sex is having in bi@@ olog@@ ical evol@@ ution ?
"And I think the answer is ex@@ change , the ha@@ bit of ex@@ chan@@ ging one thing for another ."
It &apos;s a uni@@ qu@@ e human fe@@ a@@ ture .
No other anima@@ l does it .
You can te@@ ach them in the lab@@ ora@@ tory to do a little bit of ex@@ change — and in@@ de@@ ed there &apos;s re@@ ci@@ pro@@ city in other animals — But the ex@@ change of one ob@@ ject for another never happens .
"As A@@ da@@ m S@@ mit@@ h said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a do@@ g make a fai@@ r ex@@ change of a b@@ one with another do@@ g . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without ex@@ change ."
"You can have , as it were , as@@ ex@@ ual culture ."
"@@ Ch@@ im@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ es , kil@@ ler wh@@ al@@ es , these kinds of crea@@ tures , they have culture ."
They te@@ ach each other tradi@@ tions which are h@@ an@@ ded down from par@@ ent to off@@ sp@@ ring .
"In this case , chim@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ es teach@@ ing each other how to cra@@ ck nu@@ ts with ro@@ cks ."
"But the difference is that these cul@@ tures never ex@@ p@@ and , never grow , never ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ late , never become com@@ b@@ in@@ ato@@ ri@@ al , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no ex@@ change of ideas ."
Ch@@ im@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ e tro@@ op@@ s have different cul@@ tures in different tro@@ op@@ s .
There &apos;s no ex@@ change of ideas between them .
And why does ex@@ change ra@@ ise living stan@@ dar@@ ds ?
"Well , the answer came from D@@ a@@ vi@@ d R@@ ic@@ ar@@ do in 18@@ 1@@ 7 ."
"And here is a S@@ ton@@ e A@@ ge ver@@ sion of his story , al@@ though he told it in terms of tra@@ de between countries ."
A@@ da@@ m takes four hours to make a spe@@ ar and three hours to make an ax@@ e .
O@@ z takes one h@@ our to make a spe@@ ar and two hours to make an ax@@ e .
So O@@ z is better at both spe@@ ars and ax@@ es than A@@ da@@ m .
He doesn &apos;t need A@@ da@@ m .
He can make his own spe@@ ars and ax@@ es .
"Well no , because if you think about it , if O@@ z makes two spe@@ ars and A@@ da@@ m make two ax@@ es , and then they tra@@ de , then they will each have sav@@ ed an h@@ our of work ."
"And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better A@@ da@@ m is going to get at making ax@@ es and the better O@@ z is going to get at making spe@@ ars ."
So the g@@ ain@@ s from tra@@ de are only going to grow .
"And this is one of the beau@@ ties of ex@@ change , is it actually cre@@ ates the mo@@ men@@ tu@@ m for more speci@@ al@@ ization , which cre@@ ates the mo@@ men@@ tu@@ m for more ex@@ change and so on ."
A@@ da@@ m and O@@ z both sav@@ ed an h@@ our of time .
"That is pros@@ per@@ ity , the sav@@ ing of time in sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying your needs ."
A@@ s@@ k yourself how long you would have to work to provi@@ de for yourself an h@@ our of read@@ ing light this ev@@ en@@ ing to read a book by .
"If you had to start from s@@ cra@@ t@@ ch , let &apos;s say you go out into the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
You find a sh@@ e@@ ep . You k@@ ill it . You get the f@@ at out of it .
"You ren@@ der it down . You make a can@@ d@@ le , e@@ t@@ c@@ . e@@ t@@ c ."
How long is it going to take you ? Q@@ u@@ ite a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to ear@@ n an h@@ our of read@@ ing light if you &apos;re on the a@@ verage w@@ age in B@@ rit@@ ain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
"B@@ ack in 19@@ 50 , you would have had to work for eight secon@@ ds on the a@@ verage w@@ age to ac@@ qui@@ re that much light ."
"And that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds of pros@@ per@@ ity that you &apos;ve g@@ ain@@ ed since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds in which you can do something else , or you can ac@@ qui@@ re another good or serv@@ ice ."
"And back in 18@@ 80 , it would have been 15 minutes to ear@@ n that amount of light on the a@@ verage w@@ age ."
"B@@ ack in 18@@ 00 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to ear@@ n a can@@ d@@ le that could bur@@ n for an h@@ our ."
"In other words , the a@@ verage person on the a@@ verage w@@ age could not af@@ for@@ d a can@@ d@@ le in 18@@ 00 ."
"G@@ o back to this image of the ax@@ e and the m@@ ouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The sto@@ ne ax@@ e was made by someone for h@@ im@@ self ."
It was self-@@ su@@ f@@ fici@@ en@@ cy .
We call that po@@ ver@@ ty these days .
But the ob@@ ject on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
T@@ ens ? H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds ? Th@@ ous@@ ands ?
"You know , I think it &apos;s probably mil@@ lions ."
"Because you &apos;ve got to inclu@@ de the man who gre@@ w the co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , which was bre@@ wed for the man who was on the o@@ il ri@@ g , who was dri@@ l@@ ling for o@@ il , which was going to be made into the plas@@ tic , e@@ t@@ c ."
"They were all working for me , to make a m@@ ouse for me ."
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve ach@@ i@@ ev@@ ed as a species .
"In the old days , if you were ri@@ ch , you liter@@ ally had people working for you ."
That &apos;s how you got to be ri@@ ch ; you em@@ ploy@@ ed them .
L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V had a lot of people working for him .
"They made his sil@@ ly out@@ f@@ its , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his sil@@ ly h@@ air@@ st@@ y@@ les , or whatever ."
He had 4@@ 9@@ 8 people to pre@@ par@@ e his din@@ ner every night .
"But a mo@@ der@@ n to@@ u@@ ris@@ t going around the pal@@ ace of V@@ er@@ sa@@ il@@ les and looking at L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V &apos;s pic@@ tures , he has 4@@ 9@@ 8 people doing his din@@ ner to@@ night too ."
"They &apos;re in b@@ is@@ tro@@ s and c@@ af@@ es and re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts and sho@@ ps all over Par@@ is , and they &apos;re all ready to ser@@ ve you at an h@@ our &apos;s no@@ tice with an ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent me@@ al that &apos;s probably got high@@ er qu@@ ality than L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V even had ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other ."
We &apos;re able to dra@@ w upo@@ n speci@@ al@@ ization and ex@@ change to ra@@ ise each other &apos;s living stan@@ dar@@ ds .
"Now , you do get other animals working for each other too ."
An@@ ts are a clas@@ sic example ; wor@@ k@@ ers work for qu@@ e@@ ens and qu@@ e@@ ens work for wor@@ k@@ ers .
"But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the col@@ on@@ y ."
There &apos;s no working for each other across the col@@ on@@ ies .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a re@@ produc@@ tive di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
"That is to say , they speci@@ al@@ ize with re@@ spe@@ ct to re@@ produc@@ tion ."
The qu@@ e@@ en does it all .
"In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that ."
"It &apos;s the one thing we in@@ sis@@ t on doing for ourselves , is re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven in Eng@@ land , we don &apos;t leave re@@ produc@@ tion to the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en ."
( Applause ) So when did this ha@@ bit start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think , probably , the ol@@ de@@ st ver@@ sion of this is probably the sex@@ ual di@@ vision of lab@@ or ."
But I &apos;ve got no evi@@ dence for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work mal@@ e for fe@@ mal@@ e and fe@@ mal@@ e for mal@@ e .
"In all hun@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ er socie@@ ties today , there &apos;s a for@@ ag@@ ing di@@ vision of lab@@ or between , on the whole , hun@@ ting mal@@ es and ga@@ ther@@ ing fe@@ mal@@ es ."
"It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a dis@@ tin@@ ction between speci@@ al@@ ized ro@@ les for mal@@ es and fe@@ mal@@ es ."
And the beau@@ ty of this system is that it ben@@ ef@@ its both si@@ des .
"The woman kno@@ ws that , in the H@@ ad@@ z@@ as &apos; case here — dig@@ ging ro@@ ots to share with men in ex@@ change for me@@ at — she kno@@ ws that all she has to do to get access to prote@@ in is to di@@ g some ex@@ tra ro@@ ots and tra@@ de them for me@@ at ."
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an ex@@ h@@ au@@ s@@ ting hun@@ t and try and k@@ ill a war@@ th@@ o@@ g .
And the man kno@@ ws that he doesn &apos;t have to do any dig@@ ging to get ro@@ ots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he kil@@ ls a war@@ th@@ o@@ g it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both si@@ des ra@@ ise each other &apos;s stan@@ dar@@ ds of living through the sex@@ ual di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
"When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do this ."
They were a high@@ ly co@@ oper@@ a@@ tive species .
They were a high@@ ly intel@@ lig@@ ent species .
"Th@@ ei@@ r bra@@ ins on a@@ verage , by the end , were big@@ ger than y@@ ours and min@@ e in this room today ."
They were ima@@ gin@@ a@@ tive . They bu@@ ried their de@@ ad .
"They had language , probably , because we know they had the F@@ O@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gen@@ e of the same kind as us , which was disco@@ vered here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d ."
And so it looks like they probably had lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tic sk@@ il@@ ls .
They were bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als .
But there &apos;s no evi@@ dence of a sex@@ ual di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
There &apos;s no evi@@ dence of ga@@ ther@@ ing behavior by fe@@ mal@@ es .
It looks like the fe@@ mal@@ es were co@@ oper@@ a@@ tive hun@@ ters with the men .
"And the other thing there &apos;s no evi@@ dence for is ex@@ change between gro@@ up@@ s , because the ob@@ jects that you find in Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al re@@ ma@@ ins , the tools they made , are always made from local materi@@ als ."
"For example , in the C@@ au@@ cas@@ us there &apos;s a s@@ ite where you find local Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al tools ."
They &apos;re always made from local cher@@ t .
"In the same val@@ le@@ y there are mo@@ der@@ n human re@@ ma@@ ins from about the same d@@ ate , 3@@ 0,000 years ago , and some of those are from local cher@@ t , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ si@@ di@@ an from a long way away ."
"And when human be@@ ings began moving ob@@ jects around like this , it was evi@@ dence that they were ex@@ chan@@ ging between gro@@ up@@ s ."
T@@ ra@@ de is 10 times as old as far@@ ming .
Pe@@ ople for@@ get that . Pe@@ ople think of tra@@ de as a mo@@ der@@ n thing .
Ex@@ change between gro@@ up@@ s has been going on for a hundre@@ d thous@@ and years .
"And the ear@@ li@@ est evi@@ dence for it cro@@ ps up some@@ where between 80 and 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ago in Africa , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and j@@ as@@ per and other things moving long dis@@ tan@@ ces in E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia ."
You also see se@@ as@@ hel@@ ls — as disco@@ vered by a team here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d — moving 1@@ 25 mil@@ es in@@ land from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ ean in Al@@ ger@@ ia .
And that &apos;s evi@@ dence that people have started ex@@ chan@@ ging between gro@@ up@@ s .
And that will have led to speci@@ al@@ ization .
How do you know that lon@@ g@@ -@@ dis@@ tance movement means tra@@ de rather than mi@@ gra@@ tion ?
"Well , you look at mo@@ der@@ n hun@@ ter ga@@ ther@@ ers like ab@@ orig@@ in@@ als , who qu@@ ar@@ ried for sto@@ ne ax@@ es at a place called M@@ oun@@ t I@@ sa , which was a qu@@ ar@@ ry ow@@ ned by the K@@ al@@ ka@@ do@@ on tri@@ be ."
"They tra@@ ded them with their n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ s for things like s@@ tin@@ gra@@ y bar@@ bs , and the con@@ sequ@@ ence was that sto@@ ne ax@@ es en@@ ded up over a large part of Aus@@ tr@@ alia ."
"So lon@@ g@@ -@@ dis@@ tance movement of tools is a sig@@ n of tra@@ de , not mi@@ gra@@ tion ."
"What happens when you c@@ ut people off from ex@@ change , from the ability to ex@@ change and speci@@ al@@ ize ?"
"And the answer is that not only do you s@@ low down techno@@ log@@ ical pro@@ gre@@ ss , you can actually thro@@ w it into re@@ verse ."
An example is T@@ as@@ man@@ ia .
"When the se@@ a level ro@@ se and T@@ as@@ man@@ ia became an is@@ land 10@@ ,000 years ago , the people on it not only experi@@ en@@ ced s@@ lo@@ wer pro@@ gre@@ ss than people on the main@@ land , they actually experi@@ en@@ ced re@@ gre@@ ss ."
"They gave up the ability to make sto@@ ne tools and fis@@ hing e@@ qui@@ pment and clo@@ thing because the population of about 4@@ ,000 people was simply not large enough to main@@ tain the speci@@ al@@ ized sk@@ il@@ ls ne@@ cess@@ ary to keep the technology they had ."
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a de@@ ser@@ t is@@ land .
"@@ How many of the things in our po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts could we contin@@ ue to make after 10@@ ,000 years ?"
"It didn &apos;t happen in T@@ i@@ er@@ ra de@@ l F@@ u@@ ego — si@@ mil@@ ar is@@ land , si@@ mil@@ ar people ."
"The reason : because T@@ i@@ er@@ ra de@@ l F@@ u@@ ego is se@@ para@@ ted from S@@ outh America by a much nar@@ ro@@ wer stra@@ i@@ ght , and there was tra@@ ding con@@ ta@@ ct across that stra@@ i@@ ght thro@@ ugh@@ out 10@@ ,000 years ."
The T@@ as@@ man@@ i@@ ans were is@@ ol@@ ated .
"G@@ o back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it ."
"In the case of the sto@@ ne ax@@ e , the man who made it knew how to make it ."
But who kno@@ ws how to make a computer m@@ ouse ?
"N@@ o@@ body , liter@@ ally no@@ body ."
There is no@@ body on the planet who kno@@ ws how to make a computer m@@ ouse .
I mean this quite ser@@ i@@ ously .
The pre@@ si@@ dent of the computer m@@ ouse company doesn &apos;t know .
He just kno@@ ws how to run a company .
"The person on the as@@ se@@ m@@ bly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to dri@@ ll an o@@ il well to get o@@ il out to make plas@@ tic , and so on ."
"We all know little b@@ its , but n@@ one of us kno@@ ws the whole ."
"I am of course qu@@ o@@ ting from a f@@ am@@ ous es@@ say by Le@@ on@@ ard Re@@ ad , the econom@@ ist in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , called &quot; &quot; I , P@@ en@@ ci@@ l &quot; &quot; in which he w@@ ro@@ te about how a pen@@ ci@@ l came to be made , and how no@@ body kno@@ ws even how to make a pen@@ ci@@ l , because the people who as@@ se@@ m@@ ble it don &apos;t know how to min@@ e grap@@ h@@ ite , and they don &apos;t know how to f@@ ell tre@@ es and that kind of thing ."
"And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through ex@@ change and speci@@ al@@ ization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand ."
It &apos;s not the same with language .
W@@ ith language we have to trans@@ fer ideas that we understand with each other .
"But with technology , we can actually do things that are be@@ y@@ ond our cap@@ ab@@ ili@@ ties ."
We &apos;ve gone be@@ y@@ ond the cap@@ ac@@ ity of the human mind to an extra@@ ordin@@ ary de@@ gre@@ e .
"And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons that I &apos;m not interested in the de@@ b@@ ate about I@@ .@@ Q@@ . , about whether some gro@@ up@@ s have high@@ er I@@ .@@ Q@@ .@@ s than other gro@@ up@@ s ."
It &apos;s completely ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant .
"What &apos;s rele@@ v@@ ant to a society is how well people are communic@@ ating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re co@@ oper@@ ating , not how cle@@ ver the individu@@ als are ."
So we &apos;ve created something called the colle@@ ctive brain .
We &apos;re just the no@@ des in the net@@ work .
We &apos;re the neuron@@ s in this brain .
"It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the me@@ e@@ ting and ma@@ ting of ideas between them , that is cau@@ sing techno@@ log@@ ical pro@@ gre@@ ss , incre@@ men@@ tally , bit by bit ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , bad things happen ."
"And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terri@@ ble things ."
There will be war@@ s ; there will be de@@ pres@@ sions ; there will be natural dis@@ as@@ ters .
"A@@ w@@ ful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolu@@ tely sure ."
"But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the conne@@ ctions people are making , and the ability of ideas to me@@ et and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will advan@@ ce , and ther@@ e@@ fore living stan@@ dar@@ ds will advan@@ ce ."
"Because through the cl@@ ou@@ d , through cro@@ w@@ d sour@@ cing , through the bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the el@@ ites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them me@@ et and mate , we are su@@ re@@ ly ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating the rate of innov@@ ation ."
Thank you .

So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ el@@ s .
You can zo@@ om around very simply .
You see some fu@@ n stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his ex@@ pres@@ sion is pri@@ c@@ ele@@ ss .
But then you really want to go de@@ ep .
"And so I started pla@@ ying around , and I found something going on over here ."
"And I was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ old on . That soun@@ ds interesting . &quot; &quot; W@@ ent in , and I started no@@ tic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something ."
"I did a little research , spo@@ ke to a couple of my con@@ ta@@ cts at the M@@ et , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which invol@@ ves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a sti@@ ck on S@@ h@@ ro@@ ve T@@ u@@ es@@ day ."
And ap@@ par@@ ently it was quite popu@@ lar .
"I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it ."
"Now just to get really de@@ ep in , you can really get to the cra@@ cks ."
"Now just to give you some per@@ spe@@ ctive , I &apos;m going to zo@@ om out so you really see what you get ."
"@@ Here is where we were , and this is the pain@@ ting ."
( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
"So now let &apos;s just quickly j@@ um@@ p into the Mo@@ M@@ A , again in New York ."
"So another one of my fav@@ or@@ ites , &quot; &quot; The S@@ tar@@ ry N@@ i@@ ght . &quot; &quot; Now the example I sho@@ wed you was all about fin@@ ding de@@ ta@@ il@@ s ."
But what if you want to see b@@ rus@@ h stro@@ kes ?
And what if you want to see how V@@ an Go@@ gh actually created this mas@@ ter@@ piece ?
You zo@@ om in . You really go in .
"I &apos;m going to go to one of my fav@@ or@@ ite parts in this pain@@ ting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cra@@ cks ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The S@@ tar@@ ry N@@ i@@ ght , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before ."
I &apos;m going to show you my other fav@@ or@@ ite fe@@ a@@ ture .
"There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time ."
This is the real co@@ ol part . It &apos;s called C@@ ol@@ le@@ ctions .
"An@@ y one of you , any@@ body — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re ri@@ ch , if you &apos;re po@@ or , if you have a fan@@ cy house — doesn &apos;t matter ."
You can go and create your own mu@@ se@@ um on@@ line — create your own colle@@ ction across all these images .
"V@@ er@@ y simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Po@@ wer of Z@@ o@@ om — you can just zo@@ om around ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The A@@ m@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ ors , &quot; &quot; based in the Na@@ tional G@@ all@@ er@@ y ."
"You can an@@ n@@ ot@@ ate the stuff , sen@@ d it to your friends and really get a con@@ vers@@ ation going about what you &apos;re feel@@ ing when you go through these mas@@ ter@@ pie@@ ces ."
"So I think , in con@@ clu@@ sion , for me , the ma@@ in thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google ."
"It doesn &apos;t , in my op@@ in@@ ion , even come from the mu@@ se@@ u@@ ms ."
I probably sh@@ ouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these ar@@ tists .
And that &apos;s been my hu@@ m@@ b@@ ling experience in this .
"I mean , I hope in this digital medi@@ um that we do j@@ us@@ tice to their ar@@ t@@ work and re@@ present it pro@@ per@@ ly on@@ line ."
"And the big@@ gest question I get asked no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys is , &quot; &quot; Di@@ d you do this to re@@ plic@@ ate the experience of going to a mu@@ se@@ um ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no ."
It &apos;s to sup@@ ple@@ ment the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a s@@ tor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler .
"That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , wri@@ ting no@@ vel@@ s — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of s@@ tor@@ y@@ telling and also some super@@ natural crea@@ tures called the d@@ j@@ in@@ n@@ i ."
"But before I go there , ple@@ ase al@@ low me to share with you g@@ lim@@ ps@@ es of my person@@ al story ."
"I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a ge@@ ome@@ tri@@ cal shap@@ e , the cir@@ cle , so thro@@ ugh@@ out my talk , you will come across se@@ ver@@ al cir@@ c@@ les ."
"I was born in S@@ tr@@ as@@ b@@ our@@ g , Fran@@ ce to T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish parents ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , my parents got se@@ para@@ ted , and I came to T@@ ur@@ key with my mo@@ m ."
"F@@ ro@@ m then on , I was ra@@ is@@ ed as a single child by a single mother ."
"Now in the early 19@@ 7@@ 0s , in An@@ kar@@ a , that was a bit un@@ usu@@ al ."
"O@@ ur n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od was full of large fami@@ lies , where f@@ ath@@ ers were the head@@ s of h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ ds , so I gre@@ w up seeing my mother as a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce@@ e in a pa@@ tri@@ arch@@ al environment ."
"In fact , I gre@@ w up ob@@ ser@@ ving two different kinds of w@@ om@@ an@@ ho@@ od ."
"O@@ n the one hand was my mother , a wel@@ l@@ -@@ educ@@ ated , se@@ cu@@ lar , mo@@ der@@ n , w@@ ester@@ n@@ ized , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman ."
"O@@ n the other hand was my grand@@ mother , who also took care of me and was more spi@@ rit@@ ual , less educ@@ ated and defin@@ i@@ tely less ra@@ tional ."
This was a woman who read co@@ f@@ fe@@ e gro@@ un@@ ds to see the future and mel@@ ted le@@ ad into my@@ s@@ teri@@ ous shap@@ es to f@@ end off the evi@@ l ey@@ e .
"M@@ any people visi@@ ted my grand@@ mother , people with se@@ v@@ ere ac@@ ne on their fac@@ es or war@@ ts on their hands ."
"E@@ ach time , my grand@@ mother would u@@ tter some words in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c , take a red ap@@ ple and sta@@ b it with as many ro@@ se thor@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to re@@ move ."
"Th@@ en one by one , she would en@@ cir@@ cle these thor@@ ns with dar@@ k in@@ k ."
"A week later , the pati@@ ent would come back for a follo@@ w@@ -@@ up exam@@ in@@ ation ."
"Now , I &apos;m aw@@ are that I should not be saying such things in front of an au@@ dience of sch@@ ol@@ ars and scientists , but the tru@@ th is , of all the people who visi@@ ted my grand@@ mother for their sk@@ in condi@@ tions , I did not see any@@ one go back un@@ happy or un@@ heal@@ ed ."
I asked her how she did this . W@@ as it the power of pra@@ ying ?
"In respon@@ se she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , pra@@ ying is effe@@ ctive , but also be@@ w@@ are of the power of cir@@ c@@ les . &quot; &quot; F@@ ro@@ m her , I learned , a@@ mon@@ g@@ st many other things , one very pre@@ ci@@ ous le@@ s@@ son — that if you want to de@@ st@@ roy something in this life , be it an ac@@ ne , a b@@ le@@ mis@@ h or the human s@@ ou@@ l , all you need to do is to sur@@ ro@@ und it with th@@ ic@@ k w@@ alls ."
It will d@@ ry up inside .
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cul@@ tural cir@@ cle .
We all do .
"We &apos;re born into a certain family , n@@ ation , clas@@ s ."
"But if we have no conne@@ ction wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever with the wor@@ l@@ ds be@@ y@@ ond the one we take for gran@@ ted , then we too run the ris@@ k of d@@ r@@ ying up inside ."
"O@@ ur ima@@ gin@@ ation might sh@@ rin@@ k ; our hear@@ ts might d@@ win@@ d@@ le , and our human@@ ness might wi@@ ther if we sta@@ y for too long inside our cul@@ tural co@@ co@@ ons ."
"O@@ ur friends , n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ s , colle@@ ag@@ ues , family — if all the people in our in@@ ner cir@@ cle rese@@ m@@ ble us , it means we are sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded with our mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r image ."
Now one other thing women like my grand@@ ma do in T@@ ur@@ key is to co@@ ver mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r@@ s with vel@@ ve@@ t or to h@@ an@@ g them on the w@@ alls with their bac@@ ks fac@@ ing out .
It &apos;s an old E@@ as@@ ter@@ n tradi@@ tion based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not heal@@ th@@ y for a human being to spend too much time star@@ ing at his own re@@ fle@@ ction .
"I@@ ron@@ ically , &#91; living in &#93; comm@@ uni@@ ties of the lik@@ e-@@ min@@ ded is one of the gre@@ a@@ test dang@@ ers of today &apos;s glo@@ bal@@ ized world ."
"And it &apos;s happening every@@ where , a@@ mon@@ g li@@ ber@@ als and con@@ ser@@ va@@ tives , agno@@ sti@@ cs and beli@@ e@@ ver@@ s , the ri@@ ch and the po@@ or , E@@ ast and W@@ est al@@ ike ."
"We ten@@ d to form cl@@ us@@ ters based on si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ity , and then we pro@@ duce ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about other cl@@ us@@ ters of people ."
"In my op@@ in@@ ion , one way of trans@@ cen@@ ding these cul@@ tural gh@@ e@@ t@@ tos is through the art of s@@ tor@@ y@@ telling ."
"S@@ to@@ ries cannot demo@@ lish fron@@ ti@@ ers , but they can p@@ un@@ ch h@@ oles in our mental w@@ alls ."
"And through those h@@ oles , we can get a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of the other , and sometimes even like what we see ."
I started wri@@ ting fic@@ tion at the age of eight .
My mother came home one day with a tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise n@@ ot@@ e@@ book and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in ke@@ ep@@ ing a person@@ al jour@@ n@@ al .
"In re@@ tro@@ spe@@ ct , I think she was sli@@ gh@@ tly wor@@ ried about my s@@ an@@ ity ."
"I was con@@ stan@@ tly telling stories at home , which was good , ex@@ cept I told this to ima@@ gin@@ ary friends around me , which was not so good ."
"I was an in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted child , to the point of communic@@ ating with col@@ or@@ ed cra@@ y@@ ons and apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ z@@ ing to ob@@ jects when I bu@@ m@@ ped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my da@@ y@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day experi@@ ences and emo@@ tions ."
"What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terri@@ bly bor@@ ing , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself ."
"In@@ stead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened ."
And th@@ us began my li@@ fe@@ -@@ long passion for wri@@ ting fic@@ tion .
"So from the very beginning , fic@@ tion for me was less of an auto@@ bi@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ical man@@ i@@ fes@@ tation than a trans@@ cen@@ den@@ tal jour@@ ney into other lives , other possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties ."
And ple@@ ase be@@ ar with me : I &apos;ll dra@@ w a cir@@ cle and come back to this point .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a diplo@@ ma@@ t .
"So from this small , super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous , midd@@ le@@ -@@ clas@@ s n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od of my grand@@ mother , I was zo@@ o@@ med into this pos@@ h , inter@@ national school &#91; in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d &#93; , where I was the only T@@ ur@@ k ."
"It was here that I had my first en@@ coun@@ ter with what I call the &quot; &quot; re@@ presen@@ ta@@ tive for@@ ei@@ g@@ ner . &quot; &quot; In our clas@@ s@@ room , there were children from all na@@ tion@@ ali@@ ties , yet this di@@ versity did not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly le@@ ad to a cos@@ mo@@ pol@@ itan , e@@ gal@@ it@@ ari@@ an clas@@ s@@ room democra@@ cy ."
"In@@ stead , it gener@@ ated an at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here in which each child was seen — not as an individu@@ al on his own , but as the re@@ presen@@ ta@@ tive of something lar@@ ger ."
"We were like a min@@ ia@@ ture United N@@ ations , which was fu@@ n , ex@@ cept wh@@ en@@ ever something ne@@ ga@@ tive , with re@@ gar@@ ds to a n@@ ation or a reli@@ gion , took place ."
"The child who re@@ presen@@ ted it was mo@@ c@@ ked , ri@@ di@@ cu@@ led and bu@@ l@@ li@@ ed en@@ d@@ le@@ ss@@ ly ."
"And I should know , because during the time I atten@@ ded that school , a mil@@ it@@ ary ta@@ ke@@ over happened in my country , a g@@ un@@ man of my na@@ tion@@ ality ne@@ ar@@ ly kil@@ led the Po@@ pe , and T@@ ur@@ key got z@@ ero poin@@ ts in &#91; the &#93; Euro@@ vision S@@ on@@ g Con@@ test ."
( Laughter ) I sk@@ i@@ pped school often and dre@@ a@@ med of be@@ coming a s@@ ai@@ lor during those days .
I also had my first tas@@ te of cul@@ tural ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es there .
"The other children asked me about the movi@@ e &quot; &quot; M@@ id@@ night Ex@@ pre@@ ss , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they in@@ qui@@ red how many ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ tes a day I s@@ mo@@ ked , because they thought all T@@ ur@@ ks were he@@ av@@ y s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers , and they wonder@@ ed at what age I would start co@@ ver@@ ing my h@@ air ."
"I came to learn that these were the three ma@@ in ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about my country : poli@@ tics , ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ tes and the v@@ ei@@ l ."
"A@@ f@@ ter S@@ pa@@ in , we went to J@@ or@@ d@@ an , Ger@@ many and An@@ kar@@ a again ."
"E@@ very@@ where I went , I felt like my ima@@ gin@@ ation was the only su@@ it@@ case I could take with me ."
"S@@ to@@ ries gave me a sense of cen@@ ter , contin@@ u@@ ity and co@@ her@@ ence , the three big C@@ s that I o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise l@@ ac@@ ked ."
"In my mi@@ d-@@ tw@@ en@@ ties , I mo@@ ved to I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , the city I ad@@ ore ."
"I li@@ ved in a very vi@@ br@@ ant , di@@ verse n@@ eigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od where I w@@ ro@@ te se@@ ver@@ al of my no@@ vel@@ s ."
I was in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l when the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake h@@ it in 199@@ 9 .
"When I ran out of the building at three in the mor@@ ning , I saw something that sto@@ pped me in my tra@@ cks ."
"There was the local gro@@ cer there — a g@@ ru@@ m@@ py , old man who didn &apos;t se@@ ll al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and didn &apos;t speak to mar@@ gin@@ als ."
He was sitting next to a trans@@ v@@ esti@@ te with a long black wi@@ g and mas@@ car@@ a run@@ ning down her che@@ eks .
"I wat@@ ched the man open a p@@ ack of ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ tes with tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling hands and of@@ fer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in my mind today — a con@@ ser@@ va@@ tive gro@@ cer and a c@@ r@@ ying trans@@ v@@ esti@@ te s@@ mo@@ king together on the si@@ de@@ walk ."
"In the face of death and de@@ struc@@ tion , our m@@ un@@ d@@ ane differ@@ ences ev@@ apo@@ ra@@ ted , and we all became one even if for a few hours ."
"But I &apos;ve always beli@@ ev@@ ed that stories , too , have a si@@ mil@@ ar effe@@ ct on us ."
"I &apos;m not saying that fic@@ tion has the mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de of an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but when we are read@@ ing a good no@@ vel , we leave our small , co@@ z@@ y apar@@ t@@ ments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been bi@@ as@@ ed against ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , I went to a women &apos;s colle@@ ge in B@@ os@@ ton , then M@@ ich@@ ig@@ an ."
"I experi@@ en@@ ced this , not so much as a ge@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ical shi@@ ft , as a lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tic one ."
I started wri@@ ting fic@@ tion in Eng@@ lish .
"I &apos;m not an im@@ mi@@ g@@ r@@ ant , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e or ex@@ ile — they ask me why I do this — but the com@@ mu@@ te between langu@@ ages gi@@ ves me the chan@@ ce to re@@ create myself ."
"I love wri@@ ting in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , which to me is very po@@ e@@ tic and very emo@@ tional , and I love wri@@ ting in Eng@@ lish , which to me is very mathe@@ mati@@ cal and cer@@ eb@@ ral ."
So I feel conne@@ cted to each language in a different way .
"For me , like mil@@ lions of other people around the world today , Eng@@ lish is an ac@@ qui@@ red language ."
"When you &apos;re a la@@ te@@ co@@ mer to a language , what happens is you live there with a contin@@ u@@ ous and per@@ pe@@ tual f@@ rus@@ tra@@ tion ."
"As la@@ te@@ com@@ ers , we always want to say more , you know , cra@@ ck better jo@@ kes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a g@@ ap between the mind and the ton@@ gu@@ e ."
And that g@@ ap is very in@@ ti@@ mi@@ da@@ ting .
"But if we man@@ age not to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed by it , it &apos;s also sti@@ mu@@ la@@ ting ."
And this is what I disco@@ vered in B@@ os@@ ton — that f@@ rus@@ tra@@ tion was very sti@@ mu@@ la@@ ting .
"A@@ t this sta@@ ge , my grand@@ mother , who had been wat@@ ching the course of my life with incre@@ as@@ ing an@@ xi@@ e@@ ty , started to inclu@@ de in her dai@@ ly pra@@ y@@ ers that I ur@@ gen@@ tly get mar@@ ried so that I could se@@ t@@ tle down once and for all ."
"And because God lo@@ ves her , I did get mar@@ ried ."
"( Laughter ) But instead of se@@ t@@ t@@ ling down , I went to A@@ riz@@ ona ."
"And since my h@@ us@@ b@@ and is in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , I started com@@ mu@@ ting between A@@ riz@@ ona and I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l — the two places on the sur@@ face of ear@@ th that couldn &apos;t be more different ."
"I gu@@ ess one part of me has always been a no@@ ma@@ d , physi@@ cally and spi@@ rit@@ u@@ ally ."
"S@@ to@@ ries ac@@ company me , ke@@ ep@@ ing my pie@@ ces and memor@@ ies together , like an exis@@ ten@@ tial g@@ lu@@ e ."
"@@ Y@@ et as much as I love stories , re@@ cen@@ tly , I &apos;ve also be@@ gu@@ n to think that they lo@@ se their ma@@ gic if and when a story is seen as more than a story ."
And this is a sub@@ ject that I would love to think about together .
"When my first no@@ vel w@@ rit@@ ten in Eng@@ lish came out in America , I heard an interesting re@@ mar@@ k from a liter@@ ary cri@@ tic ."
"&quot; I lik@@ ed your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I w@@ ish you had w@@ rit@@ ten it differ@@ ently . &quot;"
( Laughter ) I asked him what he me@@ ant by that .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many S@@ pan@@ ish , American , H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic charac@@ ters in it , but there &apos;s only one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish charac@@ ter and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the no@@ vel took place on a uni@@ versity cam@@ p@@ us in B@@ os@@ ton , so to me , it was nor@@ mal that there be more inter@@ national charac@@ ters in it than T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish charac@@ ters , but I under@@ sto@@ od what my cri@@ tic was looking for ."
And I also under@@ sto@@ od that I would keep dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting him .
He wanted to see the man@@ i@@ fes@@ tation of my identi@@ ty .
He was looking for a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
"We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identi@@ ty poli@@ tics af@@ fe@@ cts the way stories are being cir@@ cu@@ la@@ ted , read and re@@ vie@@ wed ."
"M@@ any au@@ th@@ ors feel this pres@@ sure , but non@@ -@@ W@@ ester@@ n au@@ th@@ ors feel it more he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly ."
"If you &apos;re a woman wri@@ ter from the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , like me , then you are expe@@ cted to write the stories of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women and , pre@@ fer@@ ably , the un@@ happy stories of un@@ happy M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"You &apos;re expe@@ cted to write in@@ for@@ mati@@ ve , poi@@ gn@@ ant and charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic stories and leave the experi@@ mental and av@@ an@@ t-@@ gar@@ de to your W@@ ester@@ n colle@@ ag@@ ues ."
What I experi@@ en@@ ced as a child in that school in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d is happening in the liter@@ ary world today .
"W@@ rit@@ ers are not seen as crea@@ tive individu@@ als on their own , but as the re@@ presen@@ ta@@ tives of their re@@ spe@@ ctive cul@@ tures : a few au@@ th@@ ors from China , a few from T@@ ur@@ key , a few from N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia ."
"We &apos;re all thought to have something very dis@@ tin@@ ctive , if not pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ."
The wri@@ ter and com@@ mu@@ ter J@@ ames B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in gave an inter@@ view in 19@@ 8@@ 4 in which he was re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly asked about his ho@@ mo@@ sex@@ u@@ ality .
"When the inter@@ vie@@ wer tried to pi@@ ge@@ on@@ h@@ ole him as a g@@ ay wri@@ ter , B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in sto@@ pped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en identi@@ ty poli@@ tics tries to put la@@ be@@ ls on us , it is our fre@@ e@@ dom of ima@@ gin@@ ation that is in dang@@ er ."
There &apos;s a fu@@ z@@ z@@ y ca@@ te@@ gor@@ y called mul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tural liter@@ a@@ ture in which all au@@ th@@ ors from outside the W@@ ester@@ n world are lu@@ m@@ ped together .
"I never for@@ get my first mul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tural read@@ ing , in H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard S@@ qu@@ are about 10 years ago ."
"We were three w@@ rit@@ ers , one from the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ pin@@ es , one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish and one In@@ don@@ e@@ si@@ an — like a jo@@ ke , you know ."
( Laughter ) And the reason why we were bro@@ ught together was not because we shar@@ ed an arti@@ sti@@ c st@@ y@@ le or a liter@@ ary tas@@ te .
It was only because of our pas@@ s@@ por@@ ts .
"M@@ ul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tural w@@ rit@@ ers are expe@@ cted to tell real stories , not so much the ima@@ gin@@ ary ."
A fun@@ ction is at@@ tribu@@ ted to fic@@ tion .
"In this way , not only the w@@ rit@@ ers themselves , but also their fic@@ tional charac@@ ters become the re@@ presen@@ ta@@ tives of something lar@@ ger ."
But I must quickly ad@@ d that this ten@@ den@@ cy to see a story as more than a story does not so@@ le@@ ly come from the W@@ est .
It comes from every@@ where .
And I experi@@ en@@ ced this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and when I was put on tri@@ al in 200@@ 5 for the words my fic@@ tional charac@@ ters u@@ tter@@ ed in a no@@ vel .
"I had in@@ ten@@ ded to write a con@@ struc@@ tive , mul@@ ti@@ -@@ la@@ y@@ er@@ ed no@@ vel about an Ar@@ men@@ ian and a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish family through the eyes of women ."
My mi@@ c@@ ro story became a ma@@ c@@ ro issu@@ e when I was prose@@ cu@@ ted .
"S@@ ome people cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed , others pra@@ is@@ ed me for wri@@ ting about the T@@ ur@@ k@@ is@@ h@@ -@@ Ar@@ men@@ ian con@@ fli@@ ct ."
But there were times when I wanted to re@@ mind both si@@ des that this was fic@@ tion .
It was just a story .
"And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to be@@ little my work ."
"I want to love and c@@ ele@@ bra@@ te fic@@ tion for what it is , not as a means to an end ."
"W@@ rit@@ ers are enti@@ t@@ led to their political op@@ in@@ i@@ ons , and there are good political no@@ vel@@ s out there , but the language of fic@@ tion is not the language of dai@@ ly poli@@ tics ."
"@@ Ch@@ ek@@ ho@@ v said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the cor@@ re@@ ct way of pos@@ ing the question are two completely se@@ par@@ ate things ."
And only the la@@ tter is an arti@@ st &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility . &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ ti@@ ty poli@@ tics divi@@ des us . F@@ ic@@ tion conne@@ cts .
One is interested in s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing gener@@ al@@ iz@@ ations .
"The other , in nu@@ an@@ ces ."
One dra@@ ws b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies .
The other reco@@ gn@@ iz@@ es no fron@@ ti@@ ers .
I@@ den@@ ti@@ ty poli@@ tics is made of so@@ li@@ d bri@@ cks .
F@@ ic@@ tion is flo@@ wing water .
"In the O@@ t@@ to@@ man times , there were i@@ tin@@ er@@ ant s@@ tor@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ ers called &quot; &quot; me@@ d@@ da@@ h . &quot; &quot; They would go to co@@ f@@ fe@@ e h@@ ou@@ ses , where they would tell a story in front of an au@@ dience , often impro@@ vis@@ ing ."
"W@@ ith each new person in the story , the me@@ d@@ da@@ h would change his voice , im@@ person@@ ating that charac@@ ter ."
"E@@ very@@ body could go and lis@@ ten , you know — ordin@@ ary people , even the sul@@ tan , M@@ us@@ li@@ ms and non@@ -@@ M@@ us@@ li@@ ms ."
"S@@ to@@ ries c@@ ut across all b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies , like &quot; &quot; The T@@ al@@ es of N@@ as@@ re@@ d@@ di@@ n H@@ od@@ j@@ a , &quot; &quot; which were very popu@@ lar thro@@ ugh@@ out the M@@ id@@ d@@ le E@@ ast , Nor@@ th Africa , the B@@ al@@ kan@@ s and A@@ sia ."
"T@@ o@@ day , stories contin@@ ue to trans@@ cen@@ d bor@@ ders ."
"When P@@ al@@ es@@ tin@@ ian and Isra@@ el@@ i poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans talk , they usu@@ ally don &apos;t lis@@ ten to each other , but a P@@ al@@ es@@ tin@@ ian re@@ a@@ der still read@@ s a no@@ vel by a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish au@@ th@@ or , and v@@ ice ver@@ sa , conne@@ cting and em@@ path@@ iz@@ ing with the nar@@ ra@@ tor ."
L@@ it@@ er@@ a@@ ture has to take us be@@ y@@ ond .
"If it cannot take us there , it is not good liter@@ a@@ ture ."
"B@@ o@@ o@@ ks have sav@@ ed the in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted , ti@@ mi@@ d child that I was — that I once was ."
But I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the dang@@ er of fe@@ tis@@ h@@ iz@@ ing them .
"When the po@@ et and my@@ sti@@ c , R@@ u@@ mi , met his spi@@ rit@@ ual compan@@ ion , S@@ ha@@ ms of T@@ ab@@ ri@@ z , one of the first things the la@@ tter did was to to@@ ss R@@ u@@ mi &apos;s books into water and wat@@ ch the le@@ t@@ ters dis@@ solve ."
"The Su@@ f@@ is say , &quot; &quot; K@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ dge that takes you not be@@ y@@ ond yourself is far wor@@ se than ig@@ nor@@ ance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cul@@ tural gh@@ e@@ t@@ tos is not l@@ ack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not be@@ y@@ ond ourselves : it makes us eli@@ ti@@ st , dis@@ tant and dis@@ conne@@ cted ."
There &apos;s a me@@ tap@@ h@@ or which I love : living like a dra@@ wing com@@ pas@@ s .
"As you know , one le@@ g of the com@@ pas@@ s is sta@@ tic , ro@@ ot@@ ed in a place ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the other le@@ g dra@@ ws a wi@@ de cir@@ cle , con@@ stan@@ tly moving ."
"L@@ ike that , my fic@@ tion as well ."
"One part of it is ro@@ ot@@ ed in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , with st@@ rong T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish ro@@ ots , but the other part tra@@ vel@@ s the world , conne@@ cting to different cul@@ tures ."
"In that sense , I like to think of my fic@@ tion as both local and uni@@ vers@@ al , both from here and every@@ where ."
"Now those of you who have been to I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l have probably seen T@@ op@@ kap@@ i P@@ al@@ ace , which was the re@@ si@@ dence of O@@ t@@ to@@ man sul@@ tan@@ s for more than 4@@ 00 years ."
"In the pal@@ ace , just outside the qu@@ ar@@ ters of the fav@@ or@@ ite con@@ cu@@ b@@ ines , there &apos;s an area called The G@@ a@@ ther@@ ing P@@ l@@ ace of the D@@ j@@ in@@ n ."
It &apos;s between buil@@ din@@ gs .
I &apos;m in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by this con@@ cept .
We usu@@ ally dis@@ tr@@ ust those are@@ as that f@@ all in between things .
"We see them as the doma@@ in of super@@ natural crea@@ tures like the d@@ j@@ in@@ n , who are made of s@@ mo@@ ke@@ less fi@@ re and are the sym@@ bo@@ l of el@@ u@@ si@@ ven@@ ess ."
But my point is perhaps that el@@ u@@ sive space is what w@@ rit@@ ers and ar@@ tists need most .
Wh@@ en I write fic@@ tion I cher@@ ish el@@ u@@ si@@ ven@@ ess and chan@@ ge@@ ability .
I like not kno@@ wing what will happen 10 pag@@ es later .
I like it when my charac@@ ters surpris@@ e me .
"I might write about a M@@ us@@ li@@ m woman in one no@@ vel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a h@@ and@@ some , g@@ ay pro@@ fes@@ s@@ or in Nor@@ way ."
"As long as it comes from our hear@@ ts , we can write about anything and everything ."
"Au@@ d@@ re L@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; &quot; The wh@@ ite f@@ ath@@ ers tau@@ ght us to say , &apos; I think , ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She sug@@ g@@ es@@ ted , &quot; &quot; I feel , ther@@ e@@ fore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful para@@ dig@@ m shi@@ ft ."
"And yet , why is it that , in crea@@ tive wri@@ ting cour@@ ses today , the very first thing we te@@ ach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?"
Per@@ haps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
I@@ ma@@ gin@@ a@@ tive liter@@ a@@ ture is not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly about wri@@ ting who we are or what we know or what our identi@@ ty is about .
We should te@@ ach young people and ourselves to ex@@ p@@ and our hear@@ ts and write what we can feel .
We should get out of our cul@@ tural gh@@ e@@ t@@ to and go vis@@ it the next one and the next .
"In the end , stories move like wh@@ ir@@ ling der@@ vis@@ h@@ es , dra@@ wing cir@@ c@@ les be@@ y@@ ond cir@@ c@@ les ."
"They conne@@ ct all human@@ ity , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of identi@@ ty poli@@ tics , and that is the good news ."
"And I would like to fin@@ ish with an old Su@@ fi po@@ e@@ m : &quot; &quot; C@@ ome , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lo@@ ver@@ s and lo@@ ved ones ; the ear@@ th sh@@ all be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m J@@ ane M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game desig@@ ner .
We do ach@@ i@@ eve more in game wor@@ l@@ ds .
"So , so far , colle@@ c@@ tively all the Wor@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft ga@@ mers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tual problems of A@@ z@@ er@@ ot@@ h ."
"Now , that &apos;s not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly a bad thing ."
We &apos;re evol@@ ving to be a more col@@ lab@@ ora@@ tive and hear@@ ty species .
And we actually build st@@ ron@@ ger social relation@@ shi@@ ps as a resul@@ t .
F@@ i@@ ve million people use it every mon@@ th .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
H@@ is work is bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant .
"But it is not , by any means , an op@@ ti@@ mal sit@@ u@@ ation ."
We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
"B@@ e@@ fore we had aw@@ es@@ ome game contro@@ l@@ l@@ ers , we had sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ les ."
Pe@@ ople were su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing . Pe@@ ople were fi@@ gh@@ ting .
This is really exci@@ ting .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 1@@ 8 years the f@@ am@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al di@@ ce game ."
"We want to imagine epi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to ach@@ i@@ eve the epi@@ c w@@ in ."
We made this game in 200@@ 7 .
This is an amazing story and ad@@ ven@@ ture for you to go on .
"We &apos;ve got a grap@@ hi@@ c no@@ vel , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in sk@@ il@@ ls like local in@@ si@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , susta@@ in@@ ability , vision and resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness ."
"The &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; cre@@ w and I were called to a little to@@ wn in C@@ ol@@ ora@@ do , called C@@ ra@@ i@@ g ."
It &apos;s only a couple do@@ z@@ en squ@@ are mil@@ es . It &apos;s in the R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies .
And the job in question was sh@@ e@@ ep ran@@ ch@@ er .
"My ro@@ le on the show , for those of you who ha@@ ven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple ."
"I &apos;m an ap@@ p@@ r@@ enti@@ ce , and I work with the people who actually do the j@@ ob@@ s in question ."
"And my respon@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties are to simply try and keep up and give an hon@@ est ac@@ coun@@ t of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life ."
The job in question : her@@ ding sh@@ e@@ ep . Gre@@ at .
We go to C@@ ra@@ i@@ g and we che@@ ck in to a h@@ ot@@ el and I realize the next day that cas@@ tra@@ tion is going to be an absolu@@ te part of this work .
"So , nor@@ m@@ ally , I never do any research at all ."
"But , this is a to@@ uch@@ y sub@@ ject , and I work for the D@@ is@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l , and we want to por@@ tra@@ y ac@@ cu@@ ra@@ tely whatever it is we do , and we cer@@ tain@@ ly want to do it with a lot of re@@ spe@@ ct for the animals ."
"So I called the H@@ u@@ man@@ e So@@ ci@@ e@@ ty and I say , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , I &apos;m going to be cas@@ tra@@ ting some la@@ m@@ bs , C@@ an you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty stra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ forward . &quot; &quot; They use a b@@ and — basically a ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and , like this , only a little sm@@ al@@ ler ."
"This one was actually around the pla@@ ying car@@ ds I got y@@ ester@@ day , but it had a certain fami@@ li@@ ar@@ ity to it ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The b@@ and is ap@@ pli@@ ed to the tai@@ l , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
"And then another b@@ and is ap@@ pli@@ ed to the s@@ cro@@ tu@@ m , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
B@@ loo@@ d f@@ low is s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ tar@@ ded ; a week later the parts in question f@@ all off .
&quot; Gre@@ at — got it . &quot;
"O@@ K , I call the S@@ P@@ C@@ A to con@@ fir@@ m this — they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"I also call P@@ E@@ T@@ A , just for fu@@ n , and they don &apos;t like it — but they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"O@@ K , that &apos;s basically how you do it ."
So the next day I go out .
"And I &apos;m given a hor@@ se and we go get the la@@ m@@ bs and we take them to a pen that we built , and we go about the business of anima@@ l h@@ us@@ b@@ and@@ ry ."
M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e is the wi@@ fe of Al@@ ber@@ t .
Al@@ ber@@ t is the sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d in question .
"M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e pic@@ ks up the la@@ m@@ b — two hands — one hand on both le@@ gs on the right , lik@@ e@@ w@@ ise on the left ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the po@@ st , she open@@ s it up ."
Al@@ right . Gre@@ at .
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t goes in , I fol@@ low Al@@ ber@@ t , the cre@@ w is around ."
I always wat@@ ch the process done the first time before I try it .
"B@@ e@@ ing an ap@@ p@@ r@@ enti@@ ce , you know , you do that ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t re@@ ach@@ es in his po@@ c@@ ke@@ t to pu@@ ll out , you know , this black ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and but what comes out instead is a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not ru@@ b@@ ber at all , you know ."
"And he kind of fli@@ c@@ ked it open in a way that cau@@ ght the su@@ n that was just coming over the R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies , it was very — it was , it was im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"In the space of about two secon@@ ds , Al@@ ber@@ t had the k@@ ni@@ fe between the car@@ ti@@ l@@ age of the tai@@ l , right next to the bu@@ t@@ t of the la@@ m@@ b , and very quickly the tai@@ l was gone and in the b@@ uc@@ ke@@ t that I was h@@ ol@@ ding ."
"A second later , with a big th@@ um@@ b and a well c@@ all@@ ou@@ sed for@@ e@@ fin@@ ger , he had the s@@ cro@@ tu@@ m fir@@ m@@ ly in his g@@ ras@@ p ."
"And he pu@@ l@@ led it to@@ ward him , like so , and he took the k@@ ni@@ fe and he put it on the ti@@ p ."
"Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , M@@ ich@@ a@@ el — you don &apos;t , O@@ K ?"
"He s@@ ni@@ ps it , thro@@ ws the ti@@ p over his sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and then gra@@ bs the s@@ cro@@ tu@@ m and pus@@ h@@ es it up@@ ward , and then his head di@@ ps down , ob@@ s@@ cu@@ ring my view , but what I hear is a s@@ lu@@ r@@ ping sound , and a no@@ ise that soun@@ ds like V@@ el@@ c@@ ro being y@@ an@@ ked off a sti@@ ck@@ y w@@ all and I am not even k@@ id@@ ding ."
C@@ an we ro@@ ll the video ?
No I &apos;m k@@ id@@ ding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pic@@ tures .
"So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; sho@@ ot , ever ."
"I say , &quot; &quot; T@@ i@@ me out . S@@ top . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two ."
"There &apos;s no wri@@ ting , there &apos;s no s@@ cri@@ p@@ ting , there &apos;s no non@@ sense ."
"We don &apos;t fo@@ ol around , we don &apos;t re@@ hear@@ se — we sho@@ ot what we get !"
"I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ top . This is nu@@ ts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know ."
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is cra@@ z@@ y .
"We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Al@@ ber@@ t &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are te@@ sti@@ c@@ les in this b@@ uc@@ ke@@ t and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him expl@@ ain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ ands . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; L@@ ike the H@@ u@@ man@@ e So@@ ci@@ e@@ ty ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the H@@ u@@ man@@ e So@@ ci@@ e@@ ty ."
"L@@ et &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the la@@ m@@ b squ@@ e@@ al and b@@ le@@ ed — we &apos;re on in five contin@@ ents , du@@ de ."
"We &apos;re on tw@@ ice a day on the D@@ is@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ K . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he pu@@ l@@ ls out a ba@@ g of these little ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ ands ."
"M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e pic@@ ks up another la@@ m@@ b , pu@@ ts it on the po@@ st , b@@ and goes on the tai@@ l , b@@ and goes on the s@@ cro@@ tu@@ m ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the ground , la@@ m@@ b takes two ste@@ ps , f@@ alls down , gets up , sh@@ akes a little , takes another couple ste@@ ps , f@@ alls down ."
"I &apos;m like , this is not a good sig@@ n for this la@@ m@@ b , at all ."
"G@@ ets up , wal@@ ks to the cor@@ ner , it &apos;s qui@@ ver@@ ing , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvi@@ ous dis@@ tre@@ ss ."
"And I &apos;m looking at the la@@ m@@ b and I say , &quot; &quot; Al@@ ber@@ t , how long ?"
"When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to f@@ all off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;"
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the la@@ m@@ b that he had just did his little pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re on is , you know , he &apos;s just p@@ ran@@ cing around , b@@ le@@ e@@ ding sto@@ pped ."
"He &apos;s , you know , ni@@ b@@ b@@ ling on some g@@ ras@@ s , fro@@ li@@ c@@ king ."
"And I was just so blo@@ wn away at how wrong I was , in that second ."
"And I was re@@ min@@ ded how u@@ tter@@ ly wrong I am , so much of the time ."
"( Laughter ) And I was es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally re@@ min@@ ded of what an ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ously shor@@ t stra@@ w I had that day because now I had to do what Al@@ ber@@ t had just done , and there are like 100 of these la@@ m@@ bs in the pen , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly this whole thing &apos;s star@@ ting to feel like a Ger@@ man por@@ no , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e pic@@ ks up the la@@ m@@ b , pu@@ ts it on the po@@ st , open@@ s it up ."
Al@@ ber@@ t hands me the k@@ ni@@ fe .
"I go in , tai@@ l comes off ."
"I go in , I gra@@ b the s@@ cro@@ tu@@ m , ti@@ p comes off ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t in@@ struc@@ ts , &quot; &quot; P@@ us@@ h it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do ."
&quot; P@@ us@@ h it fu@@ r@@ ther . &quot;
I do .
"The te@@ sti@@ c@@ les e@@ mer@@ ge — they look like th@@ um@@ bs , coming right at you — and he says , &quot; &quot; B@@ ite &apos; e@@ m ."
"@@ Just b@@ ite &apos; e@@ m off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words ."
"( Laughter ) L@@ ike , how did — how did I get here ?"
How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those mo@@ ments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , I &apos;m standing there , in the R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies , and all I can think of is the A@@ ris@@ to@@ te@@ li@@ an defin@@ i@@ tion of a tra@@ ge@@ dy ."
"You know , A@@ ris@@ to@@ tle says a tra@@ ge@@ dy is that moment when the her@@ o comes face to face with his true identi@@ ty ."
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this j@@ ac@@ ke@@ d-@@ up me@@ tap@@ h@@ or ?"
"I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my si@@ ght , so I did what I had to do ."
I went in and I took them .
"I took them like this , and I y@@ an@@ ked my face back ."
And I &apos;m standing there with two te@@ sti@@ c@@ les on my ch@@ in .
( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t sh@@ ake the me@@ tap@@ h@@ or .
"O@@ K , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; Po@@ e@@ tics , &quot; &quot; in A@@ ris@@ to@@ tle , and I &apos;m thinking — out of no@@ where , two terms come c@@ ras@@ hing into my head that I ha@@ ven &apos;t heard since my clas@@ si@@ cs pro@@ fes@@ s@@ or in colle@@ ge dri@@ l@@ led them there ."
And they are anag@@ nor@@ isis and peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
An@@ ag@@ nor@@ isis and peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
An@@ ag@@ nor@@ isis is the Gre@@ ek word for disco@@ very .
"L@@ it@@ er@@ ally , the tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion from ig@@ nor@@ ance to knowledge is anag@@ nor@@ isis ."
It &apos;s what our net@@ work does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; is .
And I &apos;m up to my ne@@ ck in anag@@ nor@@ is@@ es every single day .
Gre@@ at .
"The other word , peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tra@@ ge@@ dies , you know — Eu@@ ri@@ pi@@ des and S@@ op@@ ho@@ c@@ les — the moment where O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us has his moment , where he su@@ d@@ den@@ ly real@@ iz@@ es that ho@@ t ch@@ ic@@ k he &apos;s been s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing with and having bab@@ ies with is his mother . O@@ K ."
That &apos;s peri@@ pe@@ ty or peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
And this me@@ tap@@ h@@ or in my head — I got anag@@ nor@@ isis and peri@@ pe@@ tia on my ch@@ in .
"( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great dev@@ ice though ."
"When you start to look for peri@@ pe@@ tia , you find it every@@ where ."
"I mean , B@@ ru@@ ce W@@ il@@ lis in &quot; &quot; The S@@ ix@@ th S@@ en@@ se , &quot; &quot; right ?"
"S@@ pen@@ ds the whole movi@@ e trying to help the little ki@@ d who se@@ es de@@ ad people , and then , bo@@ om — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m de@@ ad &quot; &quot; — peri@@ pe@@ tia ."
You know ?
It &apos;s c@@ rus@@ hing when the au@@ dience se@@ es it the right way .
"N@@ e@@ o in &quot; &quot; The Ma@@ tri@@ x , &quot; &quot; you know ?"
"&quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s w@@ ei@@ r@@ d ."
"Th@@ ese disco@@ ver@@ ies that le@@ ad to su@@ d@@ den real@@ iz@@ ations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 di@@ r@@ ty j@@ ob@@ s , I have them all the time , but that one — that one dri@@ l@@ led something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t pre@@ par@@ ed for ."
"And , as I sto@@ od there , looking at the happy la@@ m@@ b that I had just de@@ fi@@ led — but it looked O@@ K ."
"L@@ o@@ o@@ king at that po@@ or other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struc@@ k by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a liter@@ al way , what other peri@@ pa@@ te@@ tic mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tions might I be able to com@@ ment upo@@ n ?"
"Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropo@@ logis@@ t but I have a friend who is ."
And I talk to him .
"( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey M@@ ike ."
"L@@ o@@ ok , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve sho@@ t in every state ?"
"You &apos;ve worked in min@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in fis@@ hing , you &apos;ve worked in ste@@ el , you &apos;ve worked in every maj@@ or indus@@ try ."
"You &apos;ve had your back sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der to sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der with these guys that our poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans are des@@ per@@ ate to rela@@ te to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see H@@ il@@ lar@@ y doing the sh@@ ots of ry@@ e , dri@@ b@@ b@@ ling down her ch@@ in , with the ste@@ el wor@@ k@@ ers ."
"I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day ."
"&quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thou@@ ghts , colle@@ c@@ tively , it might be time to think about it ."
"Because , du@@ de , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , te@@ sti@@ c@@ les are on my ch@@ in , thou@@ ghts are b@@ oun@@ cing around ."
"And , after that sho@@ ot , D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , person@@ ally ."
"And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 19@@ 0 like it ."
"I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other no@@ tions of work that I &apos;ve just been as@@ sum@@ ing are s@@ ac@@ ros@@ an@@ ct , and they &apos;re not ."
Pe@@ ople with di@@ r@@ ty j@@ ob@@ s are hap@@ pi@@ er than you think .
"As a group , they &apos;re the hap@@ pi@@ est people I know ."
"And I don &apos;t want to start wh@@ is@@ t@@ ling &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok for the Uni@@ on La@@ be@@ l , &quot; &quot; and all that happy wor@@ ker cra@@ p ."
I &apos;m just telling you that these are bal@@ an@@ ced people who do un@@ thin@@ ka@@ ble work .
R@@ o@@ ad@@ k@@ ill pic@@ ker@@ -@@ up@@ per@@ s wh@@ is@@ tle while they work . I s@@ we@@ ar to God — I did it with them .
They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of sym@@ me@@ try to their life .
And I see it over and over and over again .
So I started to won@@ der what would happen if we chall@@ eng@@ ed some of these s@@ ac@@ red co@@ ws .
F@@ ol@@ low your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 3@@ 6 hours .
F@@ ol@@ low your passion — what could possi@@ bly be wrong with that ?
Pro@@ b@@ ably the wor@@ st ad@@ v@@ ice I ever got .
"( Laughter ) You know , fol@@ low your dre@@ am@@ s and go bro@@ ke , right ?"
"I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up ."
"I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you fol@@ low your passion , it &apos;s going to work out ."
"I can give you 30 exam@@ ples , right now — Bo@@ b C@@ om@@ bs , the pi@@ g far@@ mer in L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as who colle@@ cts the u@@ ne@@ a@@ ten s@@ c@@ rap@@ s of food from the cas@@ in@@ os and fe@@ e@@ ds them them to his s@@ w@@ ine ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because there &apos;s so much prote@@ in in the stuff we don &apos;t e@@ at his pi@@ gs grow at tw@@ ice the nor@@ mal spe@@ ed , and he is one ri@@ ch pi@@ g far@@ mer , and he is good for the environment , and he spen@@ ds his days doing this incredi@@ ble serv@@ ice , and he s@@ mel@@ ls like h@@ ell , but God b@@ less him ."
He &apos;s making a great living .
"You ask him , &quot; &quot; Di@@ d you fol@@ low your passion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d lau@@ gh at you ."
"The guy &apos;s wor@@ th — he just got of@@ fer@@ ed like 60 million dollars for his far@@ m and turned it down , outside of V@@ eg@@ as ."
He didn &apos;t fol@@ low his passion .
He ste@@ pped back and he wat@@ ched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
And I hear that story over and over .
"M@@ at@@ t F@@ ro@@ ind , a dai@@ ry far@@ mer in New C@@ ana@@ an , Con@@ ne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut , who wo@@ ke up one day and realized the cra@@ p from his co@@ ws was wor@@ th more than their mil@@ k , if he could use it to make these bi@@ ode@@ gra@@ d@@ able flo@@ wer po@@ ts ."
"Now , he &apos;s sel@@ ling them to W@@ al@@ mar@@ t ."
F@@ ol@@ low his passion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
"So I started to look at passion , I started to look at ef@@ fici@@ en@@ cy ver@@ su@@ s effe@@ c@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess — as T@@ i@@ m tal@@ ked about ear@@ li@@ er , that &apos;s a huge dis@@ tin@@ ction ."
"I started to look at te@@ am@@ work and de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation , and basically all those pla@@ ti@@ tu@@ des they call &quot; &quot; suc@@ ces@@ sor@@ ies &quot; &quot; that h@@ an@@ g with that sch@@ mal@@ tz@@ y art in bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om@@ s around the world right now ."
That stuff — it &apos;s su@@ d@@ den@@ ly all been turned on its head .
Sa@@ fe@@ ty — sa@@ fe@@ ty first ?
"G@@ o@@ ing back to , you know , O@@ S@@ H@@ A and P@@ E@@ T@@ A and the H@@ u@@ man@@ e So@@ ci@@ e@@ ty : what if O@@ S@@ H@@ A got it wrong ?"
"I mean — this is her@@ es@@ y , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really sa@@ fe@@ ty third ?"
Right ?
"( Laughter ) No , I mean really ."
"What I mean to say is I val@@ ue my sa@@ fe@@ ty on these cra@@ z@@ y j@@ ob@@ s as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about sa@@ fe@@ ty first ."
"They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done ."
"And I &apos;ll never for@@ get , up in the B@@ er@@ ing S@@ ea , I was on a cra@@ b bo@@ at with the &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ li@@ est C@@ at@@ ch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first se@@ as@@ on ."
"We &apos;re about 100 mil@@ es off the co@@ ast of R@@ us@@ sia : 5@@ 0@@ -@@ fo@@ ot se@@ as , big w@@ av@@ es , green water coming over the whe@@ el@@ house , right ?"
"M@@ os@@ t ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d@@ ous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , las@@ hing the po@@ ts down ."
"So , I &apos;m 40 fe@@ et off the de@@ ck , which is like looking down at the top of your sho@@ e , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the oc@@ ean ."
U@@ n@@ spe@@ a@@ ka@@ bly dang@@ er@@ ous .
"I s@@ cam@@ per down , I go into the whe@@ el@@ house and I say , with some level of incre@@ du@@ l@@ ity , &quot; C@@ ap@@ tain , O@@ S@@ H@@ A . &quot;"
"And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ S@@ H@@ A ? O@@ c@@ ean . &quot; &quot; And he poin@@ ts out there ."
"( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated in the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 ."
It can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated on any fac@@ tory flo@@ or or any con@@ struc@@ tion s@@ ite .
"But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ on &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he c@@ alls me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; S@@ on , I &apos;m a cap@@ tain of a cra@@ b bo@@ at ."
My respon@@ si@@ bility is not to get you home ali@@ ve .
"My respon@@ si@@ bility is to get you home ri@@ ch . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home ali@@ ve , that &apos;s on you ."
"And for the rest of that day , sa@@ fe@@ ty first ."
"I was like — So , the idea that we create this fal@@ se — this sense of com@@ plac@@ en@@ cy when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility as though it &apos;s our own , and v@@ ice ver@@ sa ."
"A@@ ny@@ how , a whole lot of things ."
I could talk at l@@ eng@@ th about the many little dis@@ tin@@ ctions we made and the en@@ d@@ less lis@@ t of ways that I got it wrong .
"But , what it all comes down to is this ."
"I for@@ med a theor@@ y , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my re@@ main@@ ing two minutes and 30 secon@@ ds ."
"It goes like this — we &apos;ve dec@@ lar@@ ed war on work , as a society , all of us ."
It &apos;s a civi@@ l war .
"It &apos;s a col@@ d war , really ."
"We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t tw@@ ist our mus@@ tach@@ e in some M@@ ach@@ i@@ av@@ el@@ li@@ an way , but we &apos;ve done it ."
"And we &apos;ve w@@ ag@@ ed this war on at least four fron@@ ts , cer@@ tain@@ ly in H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wo@@ od ."
The way we por@@ tra@@ y working people on T@@ V — it &apos;s lau@@ g@@ ha@@ ble .
"If there &apos;s a pl@@ um@@ ber , he &apos;s 3@@ 00 po@@ un@@ ds and he &apos;s got a gi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ t cra@@ ck . A@@ d@@ m@@ it it ."
You see him all the time .
"That &apos;s what pl@@ um@@ bers look like , right ?"
"We turn them into her@@ o@@ es , or we turn them into p@@ un@@ ch lin@@ es ."
That &apos;s what T@@ V does .
"We try hard on &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t che@@ at ."
"But , we &apos;ve w@@ ag@@ ed this war on M@@ ad@@ is@@ on A@@ ven@@ ue ."
"I mean , so many of the com@@ mer@@ ci@@ als that come out there — in the way of a mess@@ age , what &apos;s really being said ?"
"@@ Y@@ our life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little ear@@ li@@ er , if you could re@@ ti@@ re a little fas@@ ter , if you could p@@ un@@ ch out a little so@@ on@@ er — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again ."
W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton ? I can &apos;t even beg@@ in to talk about the de@@ als and poli@@ ci@@ es in place that af@@ fect the bot@@ to@@ m line reality of the av@@ ail@@ able j@@ ob@@ s because I don &apos;t really know .
I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
"And right here guys , S@@ ili@@ c@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y , I mean — how many people have an iP@@ h@@ one on them right now ?"
How many people have their B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ ries ?
We &apos;re pl@@ ug@@ ged in ; we &apos;re conne@@ cted .
I would never sug@@ gest for a second that something bad has come out of the te@@ ch re@@ vol@@ ution .
"G@@ o@@ od gri@@ ef , not to this cro@@ w@@ d ."
( Laughter ) But I would sug@@ gest that innov@@ ation without im@@ it@@ ation is a comple@@ te was@@ te of time .
And no@@ body c@@ ele@@ bra@@ tes im@@ it@@ ation the way &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
"@@ Y@@ our iP@@ h@@ one without those people making the same inter@@ face , the same cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry , the same bo@@ ard , over and over ?"
All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equ@@ ally as possible as the gen@@ i@@ us that goes inside of it .
"So , we &apos;ve got this new to@@ ol@@ box , you know ."
O@@ ur tools today don &apos;t look like sho@@ vel@@ s and pic@@ ks .
They look like the stuff we walk around with .
And so the colle@@ ctive effe@@ ct of all of that has been this mar@@ gin@@ al@@ ization of lots and lots of j@@ ob@@ s .
"And I realized , probably too late in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can ."
"And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the te@@ sti@@ c@@ les on my ch@@ in ."
I got a lot wrong .
"So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a P@@ R cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n for work , man@@ ual lab@@ or , sk@@ il@@ led lab@@ or ."
S@@ ome@@ body needs to be out there talking about the for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten ben@@ ef@@ its .
"I &apos;m talking about grand@@ father stuff , the stuff a lot us probably gre@@ w up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little ."
B@@ ar@@ ack wan@@ ts to create two and a half million j@@ ob@@ s .
The in@@ fras@@ tr@@ uc@@ ture is a huge deal .
"This war on work , that I sup@@ pose exis@@ ts , has c@@ asu@@ al@@ ties like any other war ."
The in@@ fras@@ tr@@ uc@@ ture &apos;s the first one ; dec@@ lin@@ ing tra@@ de@@ -@@ school en@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ ments are the second one .
"E@@ very single year : fe@@ wer electri@@ ci@@ ans , fe@@ wer car@@ pen@@ ters , fe@@ wer pl@@ um@@ bers , fe@@ wer wel@@ ders , fe@@ wer pi@@ pe@@ f@@ it@@ ters , fe@@ wer ste@@ am@@ f@@ it@@ ters ."
"The in@@ fras@@ tr@@ uc@@ ture j@@ ob@@ s that everybody is talking about cre@@ ating are those guys — the ones that have been in dec@@ line , over and over ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , we &apos;ve got two tri@@ l@@ lion dollars — at a min@@ im@@ um , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the American So@@ ci@@ e@@ ty of C@@ i@@ vi@@ l En@@ gin@@ e@@ ers — that we need to ex@@ pen@@ d to even make a dent in the in@@ fras@@ tr@@ uc@@ ture , which is cur@@ ren@@ tly ra@@ ted at a D min@@ us ."
"So , if I were run@@ ning for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to make and the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to create ar@@ en &apos;t going to sti@@ ck un@@ less they &apos;re j@@ ob@@ s that people want ."
"And I know the point of this con@@ fer@@ ence is to c@@ ele@@ bra@@ te things that are ne@@ ar and de@@ ar to us , but I also know that cle@@ an and di@@ r@@ ty ar@@ en &apos;t op@@ pos@@ ites ."
"They &apos;re two si@@ des of the same co@@ in , just like innov@@ ation and im@@ it@@ ation , like ris@@ k and respon@@ si@@ bility , like peri@@ pe@@ tia and anag@@ nor@@ isis , like that po@@ or little la@@ m@@ b , who I hope isn &apos;t qui@@ ver@@ ing any@@ more , and like my time that &apos;s gone ."
"It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?"
( Applause )
"My big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lo@@ ck bil@@ lions of big ideas that are at the moment dor@@ man@@ t inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of ty@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ p@@ riv@@ ed women .
"And I learned the hard way , the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ ep ."

"I h@@ it my head on my des@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ ek@@ b@@ one , I got five sti@@ t@@ ches on my right ey@@ e ."
And I began the jour@@ ney of re@@ disco@@ ver@@ ing the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I stu@@ died , I met with medi@@ cal doc@@ tors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more inspi@@ red , more j@@ oy@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new re@@ vol@@ ution , this new fe@@ min@@ ist issu@@ e ."
"We are liter@@ ally going to s@@ le@@ ep our way to the top , liter@@ ally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ tu@@ na@@ tely for men , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ p@@ riv@@ ation has become a vi@@ ri@@ l@@ ity sym@@ bo@@ l ."
I was re@@ cen@@ tly having din@@ ner with a guy who b@@ rag@@ ged that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four hours s@@ le@@ ep the night before .
"And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this din@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ p@@ riv@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re lik@@ ely to tell you , &quot; &quot; Ei@@ ght o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck is too late for me , but that &apos;s o@@ kay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence c@@ alls and me@@ et you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly bus@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the tru@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant lead@@ ers in business , in fin@@ ance , in poli@@ tics , making terri@@ ble decis@@ i@@ ons ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good le@@ a@@ der , because the es@@ s@@ ence of lead@@ er@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ eb@@ er@@ gs h@@ it@@ ting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ics .
"In fact , I have a feel@@ ing that if Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ th@@ ers was Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ th@@ ers and S@@ is@@ ters , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ ile all the bro@@ th@@ ers were bus@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ conne@@ cted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a sis@@ ter would have no@@ tic@@ ed the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g , because she would have wo@@ k@@ en up from a se@@ ven@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or eigh@@ t-@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."

"Well , as Ch@@ ris poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the fun@@ ctions and struc@@ ture of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a minu@@ te about what this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
"@@ Here is this mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly , thre@@ e-@@ po@@ und mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly you can hold in the pal@@ m of your hand , and it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the vas@@ t@@ ness of inter@@ ste@@ l@@ lar space ."
It can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate itself con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating on the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar re@@ cur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the ho@@ ly gra@@ il of neuro@@ science , of neuro@@ logy , and ho@@ pe@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ s@@ teri@@ ous or@@ g@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little w@@ is@@ ps of proto@@ plas@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this ac@@ tivity e@@ mer@@ ges the whole spe@@ c@@ tr@@ um of ab@@ ili@@ ties that we call human nature and human consci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the fun@@ ctions of the human brain ."
"One appro@@ ach , the one we use main@@ ly , is to look at pati@@ ents with susta@@ ined da@@ ma@@ ge to a small re@@ gion of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gene@@ tic change in a small re@@ gion of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an ac@@ ro@@ ss@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your co@@ g@@ ni@@ tive ability ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly se@@ le@@ ctive lo@@ ss of one fun@@ ction , with other fun@@ ctions being pre@@ ser@@ ved in@@ ta@@ ct , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ dence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how invol@@ ved in me@@ dia@@ ting that fun@@ ction ."
"So you can then ma@@ p fun@@ ction on@@ to struc@@ ture , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular fun@@ ction ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few str@@ ik@@ ing exam@@ ples of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m giving you three exam@@ ples , six minutes each , during this talk ."
The first example is an extra@@ ordin@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ me called C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras syn@@ dro@@ me .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ bes , fron@@ tal lo@@ bes , par@@ i@@ e@@ tal lo@@ bes , O@@ K — the lo@@ bes that con@@ stitu@@ te the brain ."
"And if you look , tu@@ c@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner sur@@ face of the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ bes — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little struc@@ ture called the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you can no longer reco@@ gn@@ ize people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still reco@@ gn@@ ize them from their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even reco@@ gn@@ ize yourself in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you win@@ k and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really reco@@ gn@@ ize yourself as yourself ."
O@@ K . Now that syn@@ dro@@ me is well known as cau@@ sed by da@@ ma@@ ge to the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are syn@@ dro@@ me , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few physi@@ ci@@ ans have heard about it , not even neuro@@ logis@@ ts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras de@@ lu@@ sion , and that is a pati@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise completely nor@@ mal , has had a head in@@ ju@@ ry , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise completely nor@@ mal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ po@@ sto@@ r ."
"She &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly lu@@ ci@@ d and intel@@ lig@@ ent in all other re@@ spe@@ cts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his de@@ lu@@ sion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pre@@ tation of this , which you find in all the psy@@ chi@@ a@@ try te@@ x@@ t@@ books , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this ch@@ ap — and the same argu@@ ment ap@@ pli@@ es to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys ."
"When you &apos;re a little bab@@ y , a young bab@@ y , you had a st@@ rong sex@@ ual at@@ tra@@ ction to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us complex of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the stan@@ d@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develo@@ ps , and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its these la@@ tent sex@@ ual u@@ rg@@ es to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank God , or you would all be sex@@ u@@ ally aro@@ used when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , da@@ mag@@ ing the cor@@ te@@ x , allo@@ wing these la@@ tent sex@@ ual u@@ rg@@ es to e@@ mer@@ ge , f@@ la@@ ming to the sur@@ face , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly and in@@ ex@@ plic@@ ably you find yourself being sex@@ u@@ ally aro@@ used by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being sex@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ po@@ sto@@ r . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pre@@ tation that makes sense to your da@@ mag@@ ed brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this argu@@ ment ."
"It &apos;s very in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an argu@@ ments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same de@@ lu@@ sion , a pati@@ ent having the same de@@ lu@@ sion , about his pe@@ t po@@ od@@ le . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ i@@ fi . It looks exactly like F@@ i@@ fi , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; Right ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the la@@ tent be@@ sti@@ ality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to expl@@ ain this cu@@ ri@@ ous dis@@ order , we look at the struc@@ ture and fun@@ ctions of the nor@@ mal vis@@ ual path@@ ways in the brain ."
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , vis@@ ual sig@@ n@@ als come in , into the ey@@ eb@@ alls , go to the vis@@ ual are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vision , and after pro@@ cess@@ ing all that , the mess@@ age goes to a small struc@@ ture called the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us , where you per@@ c@@ ei@@ ve fac@@ es ."
There are neuron@@ s there that are sen@@ si@@ tive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that area &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you lo@@ se the ability to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that area , the mess@@ age cas@@ c@@ ades into a struc@@ ture called the am@@ yg@@ d@@ al@@ a in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emo@@ tional cor@@ e of the brain , and that struc@@ ture , called the am@@ yg@@ d@@ al@@ a , g@@ au@@ ges the emo@@ tional sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ da@@ tor ? I@@ s it mate ?
"O@@ r is it something absolu@@ tely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of lin@@ t , or a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? O@@ K ?"
Wh@@ ich you can completely ig@@ nor@@ e .
"So if the am@@ yg@@ d@@ al@@ a is exci@@ ted , and this is something important , the mess@@ ages then cas@@ c@@ ad@@ e into the auto@@ no@@ mic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fas@@ ter .
You start s@@ we@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ pate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cu@@ lar ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ tun@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ tro@@ des on your pal@@ m and measu@@ re the change in sk@@ in res@@ is@@ tance produc@@ ed by s@@ we@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ min@@ e , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exci@@ ted or whether you &apos;re aro@@ used , or not , O@@ K ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minu@@ te .
"So my idea was , when this ch@@ ap looks at an ob@@ ject , when he looks at his — any ob@@ ject for that matter , it goes to the vis@@ ual are@@ as and , ho@@ w@@ ever , and it &apos;s pro@@ ces@@ sed in the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us , and you reco@@ gn@@ ize it as a pe@@ a pl@@ ant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , O@@ K ?"
"And then the mess@@ age cas@@ c@@ ades into the am@@ yg@@ d@@ al@@ a , and then goes down the auto@@ no@@ mic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this ch@@ ap , that wi@@ re that goes from the am@@ yg@@ d@@ al@@ a to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emo@@ tional cor@@ e of the brain , is c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So because the fu@@ si@@ form is in@@ ta@@ ct , the ch@@ ap can still reco@@ gn@@ ize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wi@@ re is c@@ ut to the emo@@ tional cen@@ ters , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? Right ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ ex@@ plic@@ able l@@ ack of emo@@ tions ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some str@@ an@@ ge woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a scre@@ en , and measu@@ re your gal@@ van@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can measu@@ re how you s@@ we@@ at when you see an ob@@ ject , like a table or an um@@ bre@@ lla . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t s@@ we@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a lion , or a ti@@ ger , or a pin@@ up , you start s@@ we@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about nor@@ mal people — you start s@@ we@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ w@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this pati@@ ent ?"
You take the pati@@ ent and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and measu@@ re his gal@@ van@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and ch@@ air@@ s and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in nor@@ mal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the gal@@ van@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is fl@@ at ."
"There &apos;s no emo@@ tional re@@ action to his mother , because that wi@@ re going from the vis@@ ual are@@ as to the emo@@ tional cen@@ ters is c@@ ut ."
"So his vision is nor@@ mal because the vis@@ ual are@@ as are nor@@ mal , his emo@@ tions are nor@@ mal — he &apos;ll lau@@ gh , he &apos;ll c@@ ry , so on and so for@@ th — but the wi@@ re from vision to emo@@ tions is c@@ ut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this de@@ lu@@ sion that his mother is an im@@ po@@ sto@@ r ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ vely example of the sort of thing we do : take a b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re , see@@ min@@ g@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble , neu@@ ral psy@@ chi@@ a@@ tri@@ c syn@@ dro@@ me and say that the stan@@ d@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a pre@@ c@@ ise ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known neu@@ ral anato@@ my of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pati@@ ent then goes , and mother ph@@ ones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pic@@ ks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? Wh@@ ere are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no de@@ lu@@ sion through the phone ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate path@@ way going from the hear@@ ing cen@@ ters in the brain to the emo@@ tional cen@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So this expl@@ ain@@ s why through the phone he reco@@ gn@@ iz@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ po@@ sto@@ r ."
"O@@ K , how is all this complex cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we appro@@ ach this problem by consi@@ der@@ ing another cu@@ ri@@ ous syn@@ dro@@ me called ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted , or a le@@ g is am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted , for gan@@ g@@ ren@@ e , or you lo@@ se it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a ser@@ i@@ ous problem — you contin@@ ue to vi@@ vi@@ dly feel the pres@@ ence of that m@@ iss@@ ing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , even with inter@@ n@@ al vis@@ c@@ era ."
"I &apos;ve had pati@@ ents with the u@@ ter@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ ster@@ e@@ c@@ to@@ my — who have a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m u@@ ter@@ us , inclu@@ ding ph@@ an@@ to@@ m men@@ str@@ ual cra@@ m@@ ps at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stu@@ dent asked me the other day , &quot; D@@ o they get ph@@ an@@ to@@ m P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ pe for scienti@@ fic en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ bs by doing experi@@ ments ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the pati@@ ents with ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ bs cl@@ ai@@ m that they can move the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rin@@ gs , it &apos;ll wa@@ ve go@@ od@@ by@@ e ."
"Th@@ ese are very compe@@ l@@ ling , vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sa@@ tions ."
The pati@@ ent &apos;s not de@@ lu@@ sion@@ al .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s a compe@@ l@@ ling sen@@ sor@@ y experience for the pati@@ ent ."
"But ho@@ w@@ ever , about half the pati@@ ents , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b is paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a c@@ len@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s ex@@ c@@ ru@@ ci@@ a@@ tin@@ g@@ ly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pa@@ in will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b be paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed ?"
It soun@@ ds like an ox@@ y@@ mo@@ ron .
"But when we were looking at the case sh@@ e@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ bs , the orig@@ in@@ al ar@@ m was paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed because of the peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ ju@@ ry ."
"The ac@@ tual ner@@ ve sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m was se@@ vered , was c@@ ut , by say , a mo@@ tor@@ cy@@ cle ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So the pati@@ ent had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ ide@@ d at@@ tem@@ pt to get ri@@ d of the pa@@ in in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ pu@@ ta@@ tes the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m with the same pa@@ ins , right ?"
And this is a ser@@ i@@ ous c@@ lin@@ ical problem .
P@@ a@@ ti@@ ents become de@@ pres@@ sed .
"S@@ ome of them are d@@ riv@@ en to su@@ ic@@ i@@ de , O@@ K ?"
"So , how do you tre@@ at this syn@@ dro@@ me ?"
"Now , why do you get a paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case sh@@ e@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m had been c@@ ut , and the ac@@ tual ar@@ m had been paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed , and l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for se@@ ver@@ al months before the am@@ pu@@ tation , and this pa@@ in then gets car@@ ried over into the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was in@@ ta@@ ct , but paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed , the brain sen@@ ds com@@ man@@ ds to the ar@@ m , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vis@@ ual fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned paral@@ y@@ sis , O@@ K ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ eb@@ bi@@ an , as@@ soci@@ a@@ tive lin@@ k , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ s@@ ation of a paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted the ar@@ m , this learned paral@@ y@@ sis car@@ ries over into your body image and into your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m , O@@ K ?"
"Now , how do you help these pati@@ ents ?"
"@@ How do you un@@ learn the learned paral@@ y@@ sis , so you can reli@@ eve him of this ex@@ c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating , c@@ len@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now sen@@ d the comm@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m , but give him vis@@ ual fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ ay@@ be you can reli@@ eve the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m pa@@ in , the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m cra@@ m@@ p ."
"@@ How do you do that ? Well , vir@@ tual reality ."
But that cos@@ ts mil@@ lions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fun@@ ding ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) O@@ K ? What you do is you create what I call a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r box .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard box with a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r in the middle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m — so my first pati@@ ent , D@@ ere@@ k , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted 10 years ago .
"He had a bra@@ chi@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were c@@ ut and the ar@@ m was paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed , l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m , ex@@ c@@ ru@@ ci@@ a@@ tin@@ g@@ ly pain@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r like that , in a box , which I call a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r box , right ?"
"And the pati@@ ent pu@@ ts his ph@@ an@@ to@@ m left ar@@ m , which is c@@ len@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and the nor@@ mal hand on the right side of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the c@@ len@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m being re@@ sur@@ re@@ cted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ fle@@ ction of the nor@@ mal ar@@ m in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ to@@ m has been re@@ sur@@ re@@ cted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , w@@ ig@@ g@@ le your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m — your real fin@@ g@@ ers , or move your real fin@@ g@@ ers while looking in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vis@@ ual im@@ pres@@ sion that the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is moving , right ?"
"That &apos;s obvi@@ ous , but the as@@ ton@@ is@@ hing thing is , the pati@@ ent then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is moving again , and the pa@@ in , the c@@ len@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first pati@@ ent who came in — ( Applause ) — than@@ k you . ( Applause ) My first pati@@ ent came in , and he looked in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok at your re@@ fle@@ ction of your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ g@@ g@@ ling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ pi@@ d . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r re@@ fle@@ ction , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sor@@ y experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your nor@@ mal hand and ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your nor@@ mal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !"
And my pa@@ in is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ lo@@ se your eyes . &quot; &quot; He clo@@ ses his eyes ."
&quot; And move your nor@@ mal hand . &quot;
"&quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s c@@ len@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ K , open your eyes . &quot;"
"&quot; Oh my God , o@@ h my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a ki@@ d in a can@@ dy sto@@ re ."
"So , I said , O@@ K , this pro@@ ves my theor@@ y about learned paral@@ y@@ sis and the cri@@ tical ro@@ le of vis@@ ual in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely u@@ se@@ less ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started real@@ iz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of paral@@ y@@ sis that you see in neuro@@ logy , like stro@@ ke , fo@@ cal dy@@ sto@@ ni@@ as — there may be a learned com@@ pon@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple dev@@ ice of using a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ ere@@ k &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his pa@@ in — I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ ere@@ k , take it home and prac@@ tice with it for a week or two ."
"M@@ ay@@ be , after a peri@@ od of prac@@ tice , you can dis@@ pen@@ se with the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the paral@@ y@@ sis , and start moving your paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m , and then , reli@@ eve yourself of pa@@ in . &quot; &quot; So he said O@@ K , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ ake it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two we@@ eks , he ph@@ ones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r box was gone ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ to@@ m I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human sub@@ jects , eth@@ ics and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ere@@ k , does this bo@@ ther you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no ph@@ an@@ to@@ m el@@ bo@@ w pa@@ in , no c@@ len@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ to@@ m for@@ ear@@ m pa@@ in , all those pa@@ ins are gone away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m fin@@ g@@ ers dang@@ ling from the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and your box doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my for@@ e@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and eli@@ min@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m fin@@ g@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of mag@@ ic@@ ian ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sen@@ sor@@ y con@@ fli@@ ct .
It &apos;s getting mess@@ ages from vision saying the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , mus@@ cle sig@@ n@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your mo@@ tor comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this con@@ fli@@ ct , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ to@@ m , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of den@@ i@@ al — it ga@@ tes the sig@@ n@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m dis@@ appe@@ ars , the b@@ on@@ us is , the pa@@ in dis@@ appe@@ ars because you can &apos;t have dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died pa@@ in flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the b@@ on@@ us ."
"Now , this tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e has been tried on do@@ z@@ ens of pati@@ ents by other gro@@ up@@ s in H@@ el@@ sin@@ ki , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a tre@@ at@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ to@@ m pa@@ in , and in@@ de@@ ed , people have tried it for stro@@ ke re@@ ha@@ bil@@ it@@ ation ."
"S@@ tro@@ ke you nor@@ m@@ ally think of as da@@ ma@@ ge to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some com@@ pon@@ ent of stro@@ ke paral@@ y@@ sis is also learned paral@@ y@@ sis , and maybe that com@@ pon@@ ent can be over@@ come using mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r@@ s ."
"This has also gone through c@@ lin@@ ical tri@@ als , hel@@ ping lots and lots of pati@@ ents ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ wit@@ ch ge@@ ars now to the third part of my talk , which is about another cu@@ ri@@ ous ph@@ en@@ omenon called sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
This was disco@@ vered by Fran@@ c@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the n@@ in@@ e@@ te@@ en@@ th century .
He was a cou@@ s@@ in of Char@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise completely nor@@ mal , had the follo@@ wing pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s col@@ or@@ ed ."
"F@@ i@@ ve is blu@@ e , seven is y@@ el@@ low , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is in@@ di@@ go , O@@ K ?"
"B@@ e@@ ar in mind , these people are completely nor@@ mal in other re@@ spe@@ cts ."
"O@@ r C shar@@ p — sometimes , ton@@ es ev@@ ok@@ e co@@ lor ."
"@@ C shar@@ p is blu@@ e , F shar@@ p is green , another ton@@ e might be y@@ el@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia . G@@ al@@ ton called it sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia , a min@@ g@@ ling of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dis@@ tin@@ ct ."
These people mu@@ dd@@ le up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ pe@@ cts of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia run@@ s in fami@@ lies , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a h@@ ere@@ d@@ it@@ ary bas@@ is , a gene@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the ma@@ in the@@ me of this le@@ c@@ ture , which is about crea@@ tivity — sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia is eight times more common a@@ mon@@ g ar@@ tists , po@@ ets , no@@ vel@@ is@@ ts and other crea@@ tive people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ? What cau@@ ses it ?"
"Well , there are many theor@@ ies ."
One theor@@ y is they &apos;re just cra@@ z@@ y .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scienti@@ fic theor@@ y , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther theor@@ y is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ k@@ ies and pothe@@ ad@@ s , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tru@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an Di@@ ego ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ K . Now , the third theor@@ y is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia . All right ?"
"So , we found that the co@@ lor area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tal cro@@ ss w@@ ir@@ ing between co@@ lor and numbers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding co@@ lor , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be cro@@ s@@ sed w@@ ir@@ es in some people ?
Re@@ mem@@ ber I said it run@@ s in fami@@ lies ?
That gi@@ ves you the clu@@ e .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ nor@@ mal gen@@ e , a mu@@ tation in the gen@@ e that cau@@ ses this ab@@ nor@@ mal cro@@ ss w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain re@@ gion is wi@@ red to every other re@@ gion , and these are tri@@ m@@ med down to create the charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic mo@@ du@@ lar archite@@ c@@ ture of the ad@@ ult brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e cau@@ sing this tri@@ m@@ ming and if that gen@@ e mu@@ ta@@ tes , then you get de@@ fici@@ ent tri@@ m@@ ming between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and co@@ lor , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ co@@ lor sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
"If it &apos;s between ton@@ e and co@@ lor , you get to@@ ne@@ -@@ co@@ lor sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pres@@ sed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is cro@@ ss@@ -@@ conne@@ cted ?"
"Well , think about what ar@@ tists , no@@ vel@@ is@@ ts and po@@ ets have in common , the ability to eng@@ age in me@@ tap@@ hor@@ ical thinking , lin@@ king see@@ min@@ g@@ ly un@@ rela@@ ted ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the e@@ ast , and J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the Su@@ n . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the su@@ n , does that mean she &apos;s a glo@@ wing b@@ all of fi@@ re ?"
"I mean , sch@@ iz@@ o@@ ph@@ ren@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"N@@ or@@ mal people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the su@@ n , she &apos;s ra@@ di@@ ant like the su@@ n , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the su@@ n ."
"In@@ stan@@ tly , you &apos;ve found the lin@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this gre@@ ater cro@@ ss w@@ ir@@ ing and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a gre@@ ater pro@@ pen@@ s@@ ity to@@ wards me@@ tap@@ hor@@ ical thinking and crea@@ tivity in people with sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
"And , h@@ ence , the eight times more common in@@ ci@@ dence of sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia a@@ mon@@ g po@@ ets , ar@@ tists and no@@ vel@@ is@@ ts ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ ren@@ olog@@ ical view of sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
The last de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion — can I take one minu@@ te ?
"( Applause ) O@@ K . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ tes , but you &apos;re in den@@ i@@ al about it ."
"@@ Here &apos;s what I call Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t . Just like your al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"Di@@ f@@ fer@@ ent shap@@ es for different ph@@ on@@ e@@ mes , right ?"
"@@ Here , you &apos;ve got Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t ."
"One of them is K@@ iki , one of them is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ."
Wh@@ ich one is K@@ iki and which one is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ iki and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two mu@@ tan@@ ts ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a , that &apos;s K@@ iki ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands ."
N@@ in@@ e@@ ty@@ -@@ n@@ ine percent of you .
"Now , n@@ one of you is a Mar@@ ti@@ an . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cro@@ ss@@ -@@ model sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ tic ab@@ stra@@ ction , me@@ an@@ ing you &apos;re saying that that shar@@ p in@@ fle@@ ction — ki@@ -@@ ki , in your au@@ di@@ tory cor@@ te@@ x , the h@@ air cells being exci@@ ted — K@@ iki , mi@@ mi@@ cs the vis@@ ual in@@ fle@@ ction , su@@ d@@ den in@@ fle@@ ction of that j@@ ag@@ ged shap@@ e ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is eng@@ ag@@ ing in a pri@@ mi@@ tive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a sil@@ ly il@@ lu@@ sion , but these pho@@ ton@@ s in your ey@@ e are doing this shap@@ e , and h@@ air cells in your e@@ ar are exci@@ ting the au@@ di@@ tory patter@@ n , but the brain is able to extra@@ ct the common den@@ om@@ in@@ ato@@ r ."
"It &apos;s a pri@@ mi@@ tive form of ab@@ stra@@ ction , and we now know this happens in the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us of the brain , because when that &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , these people lo@@ se the ability to eng@@ age in B@@ ou@@ b@@ a K@@ iki , but they also lo@@ se the ability to eng@@ age in me@@ tap@@ h@@ or ."
"If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that g@@ lit@@ ters is not g@@ old , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The pati@@ ent says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s me@@ tal@@ lic and sh@@ in@@ y , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s g@@ old ."
"You have to measu@@ re its speci@@ fic gra@@ v@@ ity , O@@ K ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely mis@@ s the me@@ tap@@ hor@@ ical me@@ an@@ ing ."
"So , this area is about eight times the size in high@@ er — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in humans — as in lo@@ wer pri@@ ma@@ tes ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very interesting is going on here in the an@@ gu@@ lar gy@@ r@@ us , because it &apos;s the cro@@ ss@@ ro@@ ad@@ s between hear@@ ing , vision and to@@ uch , and it became en@@ or@@ m@@ ous in humans . And something very interesting is going on ."
"And I think it &apos;s a bas@@ is of many uni@@ qu@@ ely human ab@@ ili@@ ties like ab@@ stra@@ ction , me@@ tap@@ h@@ or and crea@@ tivity ."
"A@@ ll of these questions that ph@@ i@@ loso@@ ph@@ ers have been stu@@ dy@@ ing for mil@@ len@@ nia , we scientists can beg@@ in to expl@@ ore by doing brain ima@@ ging , and by stu@@ dy@@ ing pati@@ ents and as@@ king the right questions ."

I disco@@ vered their so@@ ft sur@@ fac@@ es re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed every ri@@ p@@ ple of win@@ d in con@@ stan@@ tly chan@@ ging patter@@ ns .
I was me@@ s@@ mer@@ ized .
"I contin@@ u@@ ed stu@@ dy@@ ing cra@@ ft tradi@@ tions and col@@ lab@@ or@@ ating with ar@@ tis@@ ans , next in L@@ ith@@ u@@ an@@ ia with l@@ ace mak@@ ers ."
"I lik@@ ed the fin@@ e de@@ tai@@ l it gave my work , but I wanted to make them lar@@ ger — to shi@@ ft from being an ob@@ ject you look at to something you could get lost in ."
"@@ Re@@ tur@@ ning to India to work with those fis@@ her@@ men , we made a net of a million and a half h@@ and@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots — in@@ st@@ al@@ led bri@@ ef@@ ly in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d ."
"Th@@ ous@@ ands of people saw it , and one of them was the ur@@ b@@ anis@@ t Man@@ ual S@@ ol@@ a@@ -@@ M@@ or@@ al@@ es who was re@@ desig@@ ning the wa@@ ter@@ front in P@@ or@@ to , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al ."
He asked if I could build this as a per@@ man@@ ent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and pre@@ ser@@ ve my art .
"D@@ u@@ ra@@ ble , engine@@ er@@ ed , per@@ man@@ ent — those are in op@@ posi@@ tion to idi@@ os@@ yn@@ cra@@ tic , deli@@ c@@ ate and ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al ."
"For two years , I se@@ arch@@ ed for a fi@@ ber that could sur@@ vi@@ ve ul@@ tra@@ vio@@ let ra@@ ys , sal@@ t , air , pol@@ lu@@ tion , and at the same time re@@ ma@@ in so@@ ft enough to move flu@@ id@@ ly in the win@@ d ."
We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the tra@@ f@@ fic cir@@ cle .
"So we ra@@ is@@ ed this 4@@ 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ po@@ und ste@@ el ring ."
We had to engine@@ er it to move gra@@ ce@@ fully in an a@@ verage bre@@ e@@ ze and sur@@ vi@@ ve in hu@@ r@@ ri@@ can@@ e win@@ ds .
But there was no engine@@ er@@ ing so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to model something po@@ ro@@ us and moving .
I found a bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical engine@@ er who desig@@ ns sa@@ il@@ s for America &apos;s C@@ up ra@@ cing y@@ ach@@ ts na@@ med Pe@@ ter H@@ ep@@ pe@@ l .
He hel@@ ped me ta@@ ck@@ le the tw@@ in challen@@ ges of pre@@ c@@ ise shap@@ e and gen@@ tle movement .
I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because h@@ and@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots wer@@ en &apos;t going to with@@ stand a hu@@ r@@ ri@@ can@@ e .
"So I developed a relation@@ ship with an indus@@ tri@@ al fis@@ h@@ net fac@@ tory , learned the vari@@ ab@@ les of their mach@@ ines , and figu@@ red out a way to make l@@ ace with them ."
"There was no language to trans@@ late this an@@ ci@@ ent , idi@@ os@@ yn@@ cra@@ tic h@@ and@@ cra@@ ft into something machine oper@@ a@@ tors could pro@@ duce ."
So we had to create one .
"Th@@ ree years and two children later , we ra@@ is@@ ed this 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ squ@@ are@@ -@@ fo@@ ot l@@ ace net ."
"It was hard to believe that what I had ima@@ gin@@ ed was now built , per@@ man@@ ent and had lost nothing in trans@@ lation ."
( Applause ) This inter@@ se@@ ction had been b@@ land and an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I wal@@ ked under@@ ne@@ ath it for the first time .
"As I wat@@ ched the win@@ d &apos;s chor@@ e@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ y un@@ f@@ old , I felt sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed and , at the same time , conne@@ cted to li@@ mit@@ less sk@@ y ."
My life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these o@@ as@@ es of s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture in sp@@ ac@@ es of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share two direc@@ tions that are new in my work .
"H@@ isto@@ ri@@ c P@@ h@@ il@@ adel@@ ph@@ ia C@@ ity H@@ all : its pl@@ az@@ a , I felt , needed a materi@@ al for s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture that was li@@ gh@@ ter than ne@@ tting ."
"So we experi@@ men@@ ted with tin@@ y ato@@ miz@@ ed water par@@ tic@@ les to create a d@@ ry mis@@ t that is shap@@ ed by the win@@ d and in tes@@ ting , disco@@ vered that it can be shap@@ ed by people who can inter@@ act and move through it without getting w@@ et ."
I &apos;m using this s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture materi@@ al to tra@@ ce the path@@ s of sub@@ way tra@@ ins ab@@ o@@ ve ground in real time — like an X@@ -@@ ra@@ y of the city &apos;s cir@@ cu@@ la@@ tory system un@@ fol@@ ding .
"N@@ ex@@ t challenge , the B@@ i@@ en@@ ni@@ al of the Americ@@ as in D@@ en@@ ver asked , could I re@@ present the 3@@ 5 na@@ tions of the W@@ ester@@ n he@@ mis@@ p@@ here and their inter@@ conne@@ c@@ te@@ d@@ ness in a s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ?"
"( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to beg@@ in , but I said y@@ es ."
I read about the re@@ cent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in Ch@@ ile and the t@@ sun@@ ami that ri@@ p@@ ple@@ d across the entire P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic O@@ c@@ ean .
"It shi@@ f@@ ted the Earth &apos;s te@@ c@@ to@@ ni@@ c pl@@ ates , spe@@ d up the planet &apos;s ro@@ tation and liter@@ ally shor@@ ten@@ ed the l@@ eng@@ th of the day ."
"So I con@@ ta@@ cted N@@ O@@ A@@ A , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the t@@ sun@@ ami , and trans@@ la@@ ted it into this ."
I@@ ts ti@@ tle : &quot; &quot; 1@@ .@@ 2@@ 6 &quot; &quot; re@@ fer@@ s to the number of micro@@ secon@@ ds that the Earth &apos;s day was shor@@ ten@@ ed .
"I couldn &apos;t build this with a ste@@ el ring , the way I knew ."
I@@ ts shap@@ e was too complex now .
"So I re@@ plac@@ ed the meta@@ l ar@@ ma@@ ture with a so@@ ft , fin@@ e me@@ s@@ h of a fi@@ ber 15 times st@@ ron@@ ger than ste@@ el ."
"The s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture could now be enti@@ re@@ ly so@@ ft , which made it so light it could ti@@ e in to exis@@ ting buil@@ din@@ gs — liter@@ ally be@@ coming part of the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the city ."
There was no so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that could ex@@ tru@@ de these complex net for@@ ms and model them with gra@@ v@@ ity .
So we had to create it .
Th@@ en I got a call from New York C@@ ity as@@ king if I could ad@@ ap@@ t these con@@ cep@@ ts to T@@ imes S@@ qu@@ are or the H@@ igh L@@ ine .
This new so@@ ft struc@@ tural meth@@ od en@@ ab@@ les me to model these and build these s@@ cul@@ p@@ tures at the scale of sk@@ y@@ s@@ c@@ rap@@ ers .
"They don &apos;t have fun@@ ding yet , but I dre@@ am now of b@@ rin@@ ging these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed ."
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I se@@ arch@@ ed for beau@@ ty in the tradi@@ tional things , in cra@@ ft for@@ ms ."
"Now I com@@ b@@ ine them with hi@@ -@@ te@@ ch materi@@ als and engine@@ er@@ ing to create vol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous , bil@@ lo@@ wing for@@ ms the scale of buil@@ din@@ gs ."
My arti@@ sti@@ c hor@@ iz@@ ons contin@@ ue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x .
"An at@@ tor@@ ney in the off@@ ice who &apos;d never been interested in art , never visi@@ ted the local art mu@@ se@@ um , d@@ rag@@ ged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to li@@ e down under@@ ne@@ ath the s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ."
"There they were in their business su@@ its , la@@ ying in the g@@ ras@@ s , no@@ tic@@ ing the chan@@ ging patter@@ ns of win@@ d be@@ side people they didn &apos;t know , shar@@ ing the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The way to read this sli@@ de is to look at your age on the hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal ax@@ is .
"A@@ f@@ ter pu@@ ber@@ ty , we f@@ all off the ma@@ p ."
She &apos;s a si@@ x@@ -@@ mon@@ ther .
( Applause )
I es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally became an in@@ f@@ ant in a woman &apos;s body .
"If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvi@@ ous that the two he@@ mis@@ ph@@ er@@ es are completely se@@ par@@ ate from one another ."
Ex@@ cu@@ se me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a j@@ oy .
"In@@ formation , in the form of energy , stre@@ am@@ s in si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously through all of our sen@@ sor@@ y systems and then it ex@@ plo@@ des into this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous col@@ l@@ age of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment s@@ mel@@ ls like and tas@@ tes like , what it feel@@ s like and what it soun@@ ds like ."
I am an energ@@ y@@ -@@ being conne@@ cted to the energy all around me through the consci@@ ous@@ ness of my right he@@ mis@@ p@@ here .
"And in this moment we are per@@ fect , we are whole and we are beautiful ."
"My left he@@ mis@@ p@@ here , our left he@@ mis@@ p@@ here , is a very different place ."
O@@ ur left he@@ mis@@ p@@ here thin@@ ks lin@@ early and meth@@ odi@@ cally .
And our left he@@ mis@@ p@@ here thin@@ ks in language .
And all I could de@@ te@@ ct was this energy — energy .
"And I &apos;m as@@ king myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?"
And I felt li@@ gh@@ ter in my body .
