"When I was 1@@ 1 , I remem@@ ber w@@ ak@@ ing up one mor@@ ning to the sound of jo@@ y in my h@@ ou@@ se ."
"M@@ y father was l@@ ist@@ ening to B@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws on his small , gra@@ y radi@@ o ."
"There was a big s@@ mil@@ e on his face which was un@@ us@@ ual then , because the news mo@@ st@@ ly depres@@ sed him ."
&quot; &quot; The Tal@@ ib@@ an are g@@ one ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the Tal@@ ib@@ an took over A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan and made it il@@ le@@ ga@@ l for girls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I d@@ res@@ sed as a bo@@ y to es@@ cor@@ t my ol@@ der sis@@ ter , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a sec@@ ret school ."
It was the only way we both could be educ@@ ated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different ro@@ ute so that no one would sus@@ p@@ ect where we were going ."
We would c@@ over our bo@@ o@@ ks in gro@@ c@@ ery b@@ ag@@ s so it would seem we were just out sh@@ op@@ ping .
"The school was in a h@@ ou@@ se , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small liv@@ ing room ."
It was co@@ z@@ y in w@@ in@@ ter but extre@@ m@@ ely h@@ ot in s@@ um@@ m@@ er .
"We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the teacher , the students and our par@@ ents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would su@@ d@@ den@@ ly be can@@ cel@@ ed for a wee@@ k because Tal@@ ib@@ an were sus@@ pic@@ i@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being follo@@ wed ?
Do they know where we live ?
"We were sc@@ ar@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ z@@ ed and dau@@ gh@@ ters were tre@@ as@@ ured .
M@@ y grand@@ father was an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary man for his time .
"A tot@@ al ma@@ ver@@ ic@@ k from a re@@ mo@@ te pro@@ vin@@ ce of A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan , he in@@ sis@@ ted that his daughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was dis@@ ow@@ ned by his father ."
But my educ@@ ated mother bec@@ ame a teacher .
There she is .
"She re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our h@@ ou@@ se into a school for girls and women in our ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to re@@ ce@@ ive an education .
"There was no question that his children would re@@ ce@@ ive an education , in@@ cl@@ ud@@ ing his dau@@ gh@@ ters , des@@ p@@ ite the Tal@@ ib@@ an , des@@ p@@ ite the ris@@ ks ."
"T@@ o him , there was gre@@ ater ris@@ k in not educ@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ uring Tal@@ ib@@ an years , I remem@@ ber there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted by our life and always being sc@@ ar@@ ed and not see@@ ing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , my daughter , you can l@@ ose everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be for@@ ced to leave your home d@@ uring a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to s@@ ell our blo@@ od to pa@@ y your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to contin@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; To@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ ised in a country that has been des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed by dec@@ ad@@ es of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ y@@ ond high school , and had my family not been so com@@ mit@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I st@@ and here a pro@@ u@@ d grad@@ u@@ ate of M@@ id@@ d@@ l@@ eb@@ ur@@ y C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ en I re@@ turned to A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan , my grand@@ father , the one ex@@ il@@ ed from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his dau@@ gh@@ ters , was amo@@ n@@ g the first to con@@ gra@@ tul@@ ate me ."
"He not only bra@@ gs about my college de@@ g@@ ree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dr@@ ive him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ ul ."
( Applause ) M@@ y family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ ams even big@@ ger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global amb@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global cam@@ pa@@ ign to educ@@ ate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ ou@@ nd@@ ed S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan , a country where it &apos;s still ris@@ k@@ y for girls to go to school ."
The exc@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with amb@@ ition gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing at op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity .
"And I see their par@@ ents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , des@@ p@@ ite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ position ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e A@@ h@@ m@@ ed . That &apos;s not his real na@@ me , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ m@@ ed is the father of one of my students ."
"@@ L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his daughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their village , and they liter@@ ally mis@@ sed being kil@@ led by a ro@@ ad@@ side bom@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ r@@ iv@@ ed home , the ph@@ one ran@@ g , a vo@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he s@@ ent his daughter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and bac@@ k@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to real@@ ize about A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan , and this is something that is of@@ ten dis@@ mis@@ sed in the W@@ est , that be@@ h@@ ind most of us who suc@@ ce@@ ed is a father who recogni@@ z@@ es the val@@ ue in his daughter and who se@@ es that her success is his success ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers ar@@ en &apos;t k@@ ey in our success .
"In fact , they &apos;re of@@ ten the in@@ iti@@ al and con@@ vin@@ c@@ ing ne@@ g@@ ot@@ i@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their dau@@ gh@@ ters , but in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a society like in A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan , we must have the sup@@ port of men ."
"@@ U@@ nd@@ er the Tal@@ ib@@ an , girls who went to school numb@@ er@@ ed in the hund@@ re@@ ds — remem@@ ber , it was il@@ le@@ ga@@ l ."
"But today , more than three million girls are in school in A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan ."
( Applause ) A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americ@@ ans see the fra@@ g@@ il@@ ity in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much be@@ y@@ ond the U.S. tro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan , when I see the students in my school and their par@@ ents who adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , who en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge them , I see a p@@ rom@@ is@@ ing future and las@@ ting change ."
"T@@ o me , A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan is a country of hop@@ e and b@@ ou@@ nd@@ less possibil@@ ities , and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"@@ Just absol@@ ut@@ ely ama@@ zing , every single d@@ ive ."
D@@ i@@ sa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars right into the bac@@ k@@ ground .
"So , he &apos;s bl@@ uf@@ f@@ ing . Let &apos;s do it bac@@ k@@ wards ."
"One , two , three ."
"When I was seven years old , I saw my first publi@@ c ex@@ ec@@ ution ."
"If anything se@@ em@@ ed un@@ natural , I could be im@@ pris@@ on@@ ed and re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated ."
"E@@ v@@ en though I was really for@@ tun@@ ate to get out , many other N@@ or@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ ans have not been so l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ."
"E@@ v@@ en after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned up@@ side down in an inst@@ ant ."
"We are all K@@ or@@ e@@ an , but inside , we have become very different , d@@ ue to 6@@ 7 years of div@@ is@@ ion ."
A@@ m I S@@ ou@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ an or N@@ or@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ an ?
So I started plan@@ ning how to help them es@@ cap@@ e .
I was so sur@@ pris@@ ed that a tot@@ al stran@@ ger car@@ ed enough to ask .
I realiz@@ ed that this was a sym@@ bol@@ ic moment in my life .
This is a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten we des@@ ign@@ ed in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten to be a cir@@ cle .
It &apos;s a kind of en@@ dl@@ ess cir@@ cul@@ ation on top of the ro@@ of .
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we des@@ ign this ?
"The princip@@ al of this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ sis@@ ted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net s@@ tic@@ king out from the edge of the ro@@ of ?"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es po@@ p@@ ping through .
And we were allowed to call this rop@@ e as a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il .
"But of course , rop@@ e has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times 40 children are around a tree .
"The bo@@ y on the br@@ an@@ ch , he lov@@ es the tree so he is e@@ ating the tree ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they s@@ it on the edge ."
It looks so n@@ ice from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ k@@ ey@@ s in the zo@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ ed@@ ing time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g wa@@ sh@@ ing place — there are many kinds of water t@@ aps .
"You see with the fle@@ x@@ ible t@@ ub@@ es , you want to sp@@ ra@@ y water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in fron@@ t is quite nor@@ mal ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not wa@@ sh@@ ing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s p@@ ut@@ ting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten is complet@@ ely op@@ en , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y between inside and outside .
So it means basically this arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y between clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms .
So there is no ac@@ ous@@ tic bar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qu@@ iet bo@@ x , some of them get really nerv@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , there is no reason they get nerv@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y .
"And the princip@@ al says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to st@@ ay in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back ev@@ ent@@ ually , because it &apos;s a cir@@ cle , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of occ@@ as@@ ion , us@@ ually children try to h@@ ide some@@ where ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ d@@ ly , we cons@@ ider no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qu@@ iet space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , these children show ama@@ zing con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion in clas@@ s ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the j@@ un@@ g@@ le with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not sup@@ posed to be in sil@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under contro@@ l ."
"You know , it &apos;s complet@@ ely op@@ en ."
And you should know that we can go sk@@ i@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in w@@ in@@ ter .
In s@@ um@@ m@@ er you go s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
You never mel@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are sup@@ posed to be outside ."
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they div@@ ide clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms .
They are sup@@ posed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A clas@@ s@@ room .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the clas@@ s@@ room .
A mon@@ k@@ ey trying to f@@ ish another mon@@ k@@ ey from ab@@ ove .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ k@@ ey@@ s . ( Laughter )
And each clas@@ s@@ room has at le@@ ast one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ an@@ ta C@@ la@@ us comes down at the time of Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ mas .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x buil@@ ding , right next to that ov@@ al-@@ shap@@ ed kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten ."
The buil@@ ding is only five met@@ ers t@@ all with seven flo@@ ors .
"And of course , the ce@@ il@@ ing he@@ ight is very low ."
So you have to cons@@ ider saf@@ ety .
"So , we put our children , a daughter and a son ."
They tried to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s ok@@ ay . H@@ is sk@@ ul@@ l is quite strong .
He is res@@ il@@ i@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to j@@ um@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The t@@ raf@@ f@@ ic j@@ am is a@@ w@@ ful in To@@ k@@ y@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The driv@@ er in fron@@ t , she need@@ s to learn how to dr@@ ive ."
"Now these days , kids need a small do@@ sage of dan@@ ger ."
"And in this kind of occ@@ as@@ ion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity we are l@@ os@@ ing these days .
"Now , this dra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the movement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 met@@ ers in the mor@@ ning ."
But the sur@@ pr@@ ise is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 met@@ ers on average ."
And these children have the high@@ est a@@ th@@ le@@ tic abil@@ ities amo@@ n@@ g many kin@@ der@@ gar@@ t@@ ens .
"The princip@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
"M@@ y point is don &apos;t contro@@ l them , don &apos;t pro@@ t@@ ect them too much , and they need to tum@@ ble some@@ times ."
They need to get some in@@ j@@ ur@@ y .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
And this is one of the att@@ emp@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real challen@@ g@@ es is to in@@ nov@@ ate fundam@@ ent@@ ally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ th@@ ral@@ led to in education ."
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seri@@ ously .
"C@@ an I ask you to pl@@ ease rec@@ all a time when you really lov@@ ed something — a mo@@ vi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a son@@ g or a bo@@ ok — and you re@@ com@@ men@@ ded it wh@@ ol@@ e@@ he@@ art@@ ed@@ ly to someone you also really li@@ ked , and you an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated that re@@ action , you wa@@ ited for it , and it came back , and the person h@@ ated it ?"
"So , by way of int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I sp@@ ent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school mat@@ h ."
"I s@@ ell a produc@@ t to a mark@@ et that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ ced by la@@ w to buy it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a l@@ os@@ ing pro@@ position ."
"So there &apos;s a us@@ e@@ ful st@@ ere@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about students that I see , a us@@ e@@ ful st@@ ere@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about you all ."
"I could give you gu@@ ys an alg@@ eb@@ ra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would exp@@ ect no high@@ er than a 2@@ 5 percent pas@@ s ra@@ te ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call mat@@ h education in the U.S. today .
"T@@ o start with , I &apos;d like to bre@@ ak mat@@ h down into two cat@@ eg@@ ories ."
One is comput@@ ation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ t@@ or@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ tics with lead@@ ing co@@ ef@@ fici@@ ents gre@@ ater than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to rel@@ ear@@ n , pro@@ vid@@ ed you have a really strong gro@@ und@@ ing in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the ap@@ plic@@ ation of mat@@ h proc@@ ess@@ es to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.S@@ ."
all but en@@ sur@@ es they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to cl@@ ose with , why this is an ama@@ zing time to be a mat@@ h teacher ."
"So first , five sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms that you &apos;re doing mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your clas@@ s@@ room ."
One is a l@@ ack of in@@ iti@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your lec@@ ture b@@ loc@@ k and im@@ medi@@ ately you have five h@@ ands going up asking you to re@@ -@@ explain the enti@@ re thing at their des@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ dents l@@ ack per@@ s@@ ever@@ ance .
"They l@@ ack re@@ t@@ en@@ tion ; you find yourself re@@ -@@ expl@@ ain@@ ing con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ ol@@ e@@ sa@@ le ."
"There &apos;s an aver@@ sion to word problems , which describ@@ es 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the form@@ ul@@ a to ap@@ ply in that sit@@ u@@ ation .
This is really des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tive .
"D@@ av@@ id M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ at@@ or of &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ad@@ w@@ ood &quot; &quot; and other ama@@ zing T@@ V sho@@ ws , has a really good descri@@ p@@ tion for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary dra@@ ma , sho@@ ws set in the pres@@ ent day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four h@@ ours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ re@@ sp@@ ect , it shap@@ es the ne@@ ural pa@@ th@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they exp@@ ect simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an im@@ pati@@ ence with ir@@ res@@ ol@@ ution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re im@@ pati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t res@@ ol@@ ve quickly ."
"You exp@@ ect sit@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three com@@ mer@@ cial bre@@ ak@@ s and a l@@ au@@ gh trac@@ k ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ v@@ ing is that simple ."
I am very con@@ c@@ er@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will ru@@ n .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our t@@ ext@@ bo@@ o@@ ks — particul@@ arly mas@@ s@@ -@@ ad@@ op@@ ted t@@ ext@@ bo@@ o@@ ks — te@@ ach mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ v@@ ing , it &apos;s fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ally equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent to turn@@ ing on &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and call@@ ing it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all seri@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics t@@ ext@@ bo@@ ok .
It app@@ lies equ@@ ally to mat@@ h .
"@@ N@@ ot@@ ice , first of all here , that you have exactly three piec@@ es of information there , each of which will fig@@ ure into a form@@ ul@@ a some@@ where , ev@@ ent@@ ually , which the stud@@ ent will then comput@@ e ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ v@@ ing where you knew all of the giv@@ en information in adv@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ pl@@ us of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have suf@@ fici@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ v@@ ing is like that .
"And the t@@ ext@@ bo@@ ok , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s h@@ am@@ str@@ ing@@ ing students because , watch this , this is the pra@@ c@@ tice problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tu@@ al problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ w@@ app@@ ing out numbers and tw@@ e@@ ak@@ ing the cont@@ ex@@ t a little bit ."
"And if the stud@@ ent still doesn &apos;t recogni@@ ze the st@@ am@@ p this was mo@@ l@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ fully expl@@ ains to you what sam@@ ple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the form@@ ul@@ a ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , pas@@ s this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any physics , just kno@@ wing how to dec@@ od@@ e a t@@ ext@@ bo@@ ok . That &apos;s a sh@@ ame ."
So I can diag@@ n@@ ose the problem a little more speci@@ fic@@ ally in mat@@ h .
Here &apos;s a really co@@ ol problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ p@@ e using a s@@ ki li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers , and I &apos;m cur@@ i@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers and , particul@@ arly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pres@@ sed together and pres@@ ent@@ ed to the stud@@ ent all at once , how that cre@@ ates this im@@ pati@@ ent problem sol@@ v@@ ing ."
I &apos;ll defin@@ e them here : You have the vis@@ ual .
"You also have the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical struc@@ ture , talking about gr@@ id@@ s , meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , lab@@ els , poin@@ ts , ax@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ ste@@ ps , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which sec@@ tion is the ste@@ e@@ p@@ est ."
So I hop@@ e you can see .
"I really hop@@ e you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is tak@@ ing a comp@@ elling question , a comp@@ elling answer , but we &apos;re p@@ av@@ ing a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , stra@@ ight pat@@ h from one to the other and con@@ gra@@ tul@@ ating our students for how well they can ste@@ p over the small cra@@ c@@ ks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of pati@@ ent problem sol@@ v@@ ing ."
"So right here I start with the vis@@ ual , and I im@@ medi@@ ately ask the question : Wh@@ ich sec@@ tion is the ste@@ e@@ p@@ est ?"
And this star@@ ts con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion because the vis@@ ual is created in such a way where you can de@@ f@@ end two ans@@ w@@ ers .
"So you get people arg@@ u@@ ing against each other , fri@@ end ver@@ s@@ us fri@@ end , in pa@@ ir@@ s , jour@@ n@@ al@@ ing , wh@@ at@@ ever ."
And then ev@@ ent@@ ually we real@@ ize it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the sk@@ i@@ er in the lower le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the sk@@ i@@ er just ab@@ ove the mi@@ d line .
"And we real@@ ize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D lab@@ els to talk about them more eas@@ ily ."
"And then as we start to defin@@ e what does ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness mean , we real@@ ize it would be n@@ ice to have some meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments to really nar@@ row it down , speci@@ fic@@ ally what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ row down that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical struc@@ ture ."
"The mat@@ h ser@@ ves the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the mat@@ h ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 clas@@ ses are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ p@@ e , ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then devel@@ op those sub@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"@@ Do you gu@@ ys see how this , right here , com@@ par@@ ed to that — which one cre@@ ates that pati@@ ent problem sol@@ v@@ ing , that mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been ob@@ vi@@ ous in my pra@@ c@@ tice , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ i@@ el@@ d the flo@@ or here for a second to E@@ instein , who , I believe , has pa@@ id his d@@ ues ."
"He tal@@ ked about the form@@ ul@@ ation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my pra@@ c@@ tice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve them in the form@@ ul@@ ation of the problem ."
So 9@@ 0 percent of what I do with my five h@@ ours of pre@@ p time per wee@@ k is to take fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ elling el@@ ements of problems like this from my t@@ ext@@ bo@@ ok and reb@@ u@@ il@@ d them in a way that sup@@ por@@ ts mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ v@@ ing .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tan@@ k .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ irst things first , we el@@ im@@ in@@ ate all the sub@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents have to devel@@ op those , they have to form@@ ul@@ ate those ."
And then not@@ ice that all the information writ@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"@@ N@@ one of it &apos;s a dis@@ trac@@ tor , so we l@@ ose that ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents need to dec@@ ide , &quot; &quot; A@@ ll right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the col@@ or of the val@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; S@@ uch an under@@ re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ed question in mat@@ h cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um .
So now we have a water tan@@ k .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or cli@@ p art that you so of@@ ten see in t@@ ext@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real de@@ al .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone fil@@ l@@ ing it up ."
"And it &apos;s fil@@ l@@ ing up s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ dents are looking at their wat@@ ch@@ es , ro@@ l@@ l@@ ing their ey@@ es , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve b@@ a@@ ited the h@@ ook , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fu@@ n for me because , like the int@@ ro , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about mat@@ h because someone else has the form@@ ul@@ a ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the form@@ ul@@ a better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stud@@ ent is on a level pl@@ a@@ ying field of in@@ tu@@ ition ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ one &apos;s fil@@ led something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tically and con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion@@ ally in@@ ti@@ mi@@ da@@ ted jo@@ in@@ ing the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"We put nam@@ es on the bo@@ ard , att@@ ach them to gu@@ ess@@ es , and kids have b@@ ou@@ ght in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve describ@@ ed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer k@@ ey in the back of the teacher &apos;s ed@@ ition ."
"We , instead , just watch the end of the mo@@ vi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ or@@ e@@ tical mod@@ els that always work out in the answer k@@ ey in the back of a teacher &apos;s ed@@ ition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s sc@@ ary to talk about s@@ our@@ ces of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ or@@ e@@ tical does not mat@@ ch up with the pra@@ c@@ tical ."
"But those con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions have been so val@@ u@@ able , amo@@ n@@ g the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ port some really fu@@ n gam@@ es with students who come pre@@ -@@ inst@@ all@@ ed with these vir@@ us@@ es day one of the clas@@ s .
"Th@@ ese are the kids who now , one s@@ em@@ es@@ ter in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , tot@@ ally new , tot@@ ally for@@ e@@ ign , and they &apos;ll have a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fu@@ n ."
"We &apos;re no longer aver@@ se to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ ti@@ mi@@ da@@ ted by mat@@ h , because we &apos;re s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ defin@@ ing what mat@@ h is ."
This has been a lot of fu@@ n .
"I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge mat@@ h teachers I talk to to use multi@@ med@@ ia , because it br@@ ings the real world into your clas@@ s@@ room in high res@@ ol@@ ution and ful@@ l col@@ or ; to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge stud@@ ent in@@ tu@@ ition for that level pl@@ a@@ ying field ; to ask the shor@@ test question you possi@@ bly can and let those more spec@@ if@@ ic questions come out in con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ; to let students build the problem , because E@@ instein said so ; and to finally , in tot@@ al , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the t@@ ext@@ bo@@ ok is hel@@ ping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tion , for pati@@ ent problem sol@@ v@@ ing and mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an ama@@ zing time to be a mat@@ h teacher right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um in our fron@@ t po@@ c@@ k@@ et .
"It &apos;s ub@@ i@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fa@@ ir@@ ly che@@ a@@ p , and the to@@ ols to dis@@ trib@@ ute it fre@@ ely under op@@ en l@@ ic@@ en@@ ses has also never been che@@ ap@@ er or more ub@@ i@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a video ser@@ ies on my blo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vie@@ ws in two weeks ."
"I get e@@ ma@@ ils still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never vis@@ ited saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ ah . We had a good con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow ."
"I put this problem on my blo@@ g rec@@ ently : In a gro@@ c@@ ery st@@ ore , which line do you get into , the one that has one c@@ art and 1@@ 9 it@@ ems or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one it@@ ems ."
"And the l@@ in@@ e@@ ar mod@@ el@@ ing inv@@ ol@@ ved in that was some good stuff for my clas@@ s@@ room , but it ev@@ ent@@ ually got me on &quot; &quot; G@@ ood M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just biz@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ cl@@ u@@ de that people , not just students , are really h@@ un@@ gr@@ y for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary for your own in@@ tu@@ ition .
"So I just really en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , wh@@ at@@ ever your st@@ ake is in education — whether you &apos;re a stud@@ ent , par@@ ent , teacher , pol@@ ic@@ y mak@@ er , wh@@ at@@ ever — in@@ s@@ ist on better mat@@ h cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um ."
We need more pati@@ ent problem sol@@ v@@ ers . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ ro C@@ or@@ por@@ ation of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of pl@@ as@@ tic with a R@@ a@@ di@@ o S@@ h@@ ack ant@@ en@@ na att@@ ach@@ ed to it .
So that &apos;s just a fu@@ n little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ or@@ t of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and pl@@ umb@@ ing comp@@ ati@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a B@@ u@@ ic@@ k h@@ ub@@ c@@ a@@ p , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a h@@ ub@@ c@@ a@@ p ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ al@@ il@@ e@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e to S@@ at@@ ur@@ n ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
There was a lot of people there .
"@@ Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the bac@@ k@@ side , which they started to wi@@ p@@ e off ."
Thank you .
"T@@ w@@ o years ago , I st@@ ood on the TE@@ D st@@ age in Ar@@ ush@@ a , T@@ an@@ z@@ ania ."
I sp@@ o@@ ke very bri@@ ef@@ ly about one of my pro@@ ud@@ est cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
"B@@ e@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in M@@ al@@ a@@ w@@ i ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Inter@@ net .
"O@@ n the st@@ age that day , I was so nerv@@ ous ."
"M@@ y English lost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed by so many az@@ un@@ g@@ u , wh@@ ite people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feel@@ ing good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"A@@ ll s@@ ist@@ ers , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my da@@ d when I was a little bo@@ y .
"B@@ e@@ fore I disc@@ over@@ ed the won@@ d@@ ers of science , I was just a simple far@@ m@@ er in a country of poor far@@ m@@ ers ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ ize ."
One year our for@@ tun@@ e turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we experienc@@ ed an a@@ w@@ ful fam@@ ine .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five months all M@@ al@@ a@@ wi@@ ans be@@ gan to star@@ ve to de@@ ath .
"M@@ y family ate one me@@ al per day , at ni@@ ght ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ si@@ ma for each one of us .
The f@@ ood pas@@ ses through our bo@@ di@@ es .
We drop down to nothing .
"In M@@ al@@ a@@ w@@ i , the secon@@ dar@@ y school , you have to pa@@ y school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the h@@ un@@ ger , I was for@@ ced to drop out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those dr@@ y fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I c@@ ouldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I f@@ el@@ t very happy to be at the secon@@ dar@@ y school , so I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to re@@ ce@@ ive education ."
So I went to a li@@ br@@ ary .
"I read bo@@ o@@ ks , science bo@@ o@@ ks , es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally physics ."
I c@@ ouldn &apos;t read English that well .
I used diag@@ ram@@ s and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ n@@ other bo@@ ok put that kno@@ w@@ l@@ edge in my h@@ ands .
It said a w@@ ind@@ m@@ ill could p@@ um@@ p water and gener@@ ate elec@@ tric@@ ity .
"@@ P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ ga@@ tion , a de@@ f@@ en@@ se against h@@ un@@ ger , which we were experiencing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one w@@ ind@@ m@@ ill for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a sc@@ ra@@ p yar@@ d where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , in@@ cl@@ ud@@ ing my mother , said I was cra@@ z@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) I found a trac@@ tor f@@ an , sh@@ ock ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ p@@ es ."
"@@ U@@ sing a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle fra@@ me and an old b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle d@@ y@@ nam@@ o , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four li@@ ghts , with s@@ wit@@ ch@@ es , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it bre@@ ak@@ er , mod@@ el@@ ed after an elec@@ tri@@ c b@@ ell ."
A@@ n@@ other machine p@@ um@@ ps water for ir@@ ri@@ ga@@ tion .
Q@@ u@@ e@@ ues of people start l@@ in@@ ing up at my h@@ ou@@ se ( Laughter ) to ch@@ arg@@ e their mobil@@ e ph@@ one .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the re@@ por@@ ters came too , which le@@ ad to b@@ log@@ g@@ ers and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TE@@ D ."
I had never seen an air@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ le@@ p@@ t in a h@@ ot@@ el .
"So , on st@@ age that day in Ar@@ ush@@ a , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the A@@ fr@@ ic@@ ans , and the poor who are str@@ ug@@ gl@@ ing with your dre@@ ams ."
G@@ od bl@@ ess .
M@@ aybe one day you will watch this on the Inter@@ net .
"I say to you , trust yourself and believe ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever happens , don &apos;t give up ."
Thank you .

We re@@ tain just 2@@ 5 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying m@@ und@@ ane s@@ oun@@ ds .
"This , for example , is my tum@@ ble dr@@ y@@ er ."
"Now sound is my pas@@ sion , it &apos;s my life ."
I &apos;m going to speak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ ues .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally underst@@ ood that questions of moral@@ ity — questions of good and ev@@ il and right and wrong — are questions about which science of@@ fici@@ ally has no op@@ in@@ ion ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we val@@ ue , but it can never tell us what we ou@@ ght to val@@ ue ."
"And , con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th liv@@ ing for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ st@@ it@@ utes a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to arg@@ ue that this is an ill@@ us@@ ion — that the se@@ par@@ ation between science and human val@@ ues is an ill@@ us@@ ion — and actually quite a dan@@ ger@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s of@@ ten said that science cannot give us a f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion for moral@@ ity and human val@@ ues , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ ues seem to b@@ el@@ ong to different sp@@ her@@ es ."
It &apos;s of@@ ten thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ p@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ou@@ ght to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ ues are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the well-being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ th@@ ical ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tions to@@ ward ro@@ c@@ ks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for ro@@ c@@ ks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ c@@ ks can suf@@ fer . And if we &apos;re more con@@ c@@ er@@ ned about our f@@ ell@@ ow pri@@ mat@@ es than we are about in@@ sec@@ ts , as inde@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ posed to a gre@@ ater ran@@ ge of p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al happiness and suf@@ fer@@ ing ."
"Now , the c@@ ru@@ cial thing to not@@ ice here is that this is a fac@@ tu@@ al cl@@ a@@ im : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed the relation@@ ship between bi@@ ological compl@@ ex@@ ity and the possibil@@ ities of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ sec@@ ts ."
"And there &apos;s no not@@ ion , no ver@@ sion of human moral@@ ity and human val@@ ues that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble to a con@@ c@@ er@@ n about con@@ sci@@ ous experience and its possible changes ."
"E@@ v@@ en if you get your val@@ ues from relig@@ ion , even if you think that good and ev@@ il ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely rel@@ ate to con@@ diti@@ ons after de@@ ath — e@@ i@@ ther to an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of happiness with G@@ od or an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of suf@@ fer@@ ing in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ c@@ er@@ ned about con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can per@@ s@@ ist after de@@ ath is itself a fac@@ tu@@ al cl@@ a@@ im , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to speak about the con@@ diti@@ ons of well-being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a contin@@ u@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fail@@ ed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where str@@ ang@@ ers cannot find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful col@@ labor@@ ation , where people are m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in@@ dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this contin@@ u@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more id@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a con@@ fer@@ ence like this is even con@@ ce@@ iv@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a to the water be a good idea ?
P@@ rob@@ ably not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the ev@@ il ey@@ e , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ ately bl@@ ame their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors ? P@@ rob@@ ably not ."
"There are tr@@ u@@ ths to be known about how human commun@@ ities fl@@ our@@ ish , whether or not we understand these tr@@ u@@ ths ."
And moral@@ ity rel@@ ates to these tr@@ u@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ ues we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our sit@@ u@@ ation in the world can be underst@@ ood at many lev@@ els — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic sy@@ st@@ ems and political ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ements ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of nec@@ ess@@ ity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realiz@@ ed in the brain — wh@@ at@@ ever happens after de@@ ath .
"E@@ v@@ en if the su@@ ic@@ ide bomb@@ er does get 7@@ 2 vir@@ gin@@ s in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his person@@ ality — his rather un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate person@@ ality — is the produc@@ t of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as inde@@ ed it does , it changes us by chang@@ ing our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ e@@ fore wh@@ at@@ ever cul@@ t@@ ural vari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ our@@ ish can , at le@@ ast in princi@@ ple , be underst@@ ood in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a mat@@ uring science of the mind — neuro@@ science , psych@@ ology , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m arg@@ u@@ ing is that val@@ ue &apos;s re@@ duc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the con@@ sci@@ ous experience of con@@ sci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can ther@@ e@@ fore vis@@ u@@ al@@ ize a space of possible changes in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a moral l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , with pe@@ ak@@ s and val@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ respon@@ d to differ@@ ences in the well-being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atures , both per@@ s@@ onal and col@@ lec@@ tive ."
"And one thing to not@@ ice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we r@@ ar@@ ely acc@@ ess , that few people acc@@ ess ."
And these a@@ wa@@ it our disc@@ ov@@ ery .
P@@ er@@ h@@ aps some of these states can be appro@@ pri@@ ately called my@@ s@@ tical or sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual .
P@@ er@@ h@@ aps there are other states that we can &apos;t acc@@ ess because of how our min@@ ds are struc@@ tu@@ red but other min@@ ds possi@@ bly could acc@@ ess them .
"Now , let me be c@@ lear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to ma@@ p this space , or that we will have sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic ans@@ w@@ ers to every con@@ ce@@ iv@@ able moral question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for inst@@ ance , that you will one day con@@ sul@@ t a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bom@@ b I@@ ra@@ n &apos;s n@@ uc@@ lear fac@@ il@@ ities , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the ful@@ l cost of TE@@ D as a b@@ usiness exp@@ en@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions af@@ fect human well-being then they do have ans@@ w@@ ers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ mit@@ ting this — just ad@@ mit@@ ting that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to the question of how hum@@ ans fl@@ our@@ ish — will change the way we talk about moral@@ ity , and will change our expec@@ t@@ ations of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For inst@@ ance , there are 2@@ 1 states in our country where cor@@ por@@ al p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment in the clas@@ s@@ room is le@@ ga@@ l , where it is le@@ ga@@ l for a teacher to be@@ at a child with a wo@@ od@@ en bo@@ ard , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing large br@@ u@@ is@@ es and bl@@ ist@@ ers and even bre@@ ak@@ ing the sk@@ in ."
"And hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of children , inc@@ id@@ ent@@ ally , are sub@@ jec@@ ted to this every year ."
"The loc@@ ations of these en@@ li@@ gh@@ t@@ en@@ ed dis@@ tric@@ ts , I think , will fa@@ il to sur@@ pr@@ ise you ."
We &apos;re not talking about Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut .
And the ra@@ tion@@ ale for this behav@@ ior is expl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly religi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ at@@ or of the universe h@@ im@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , l@@ est we sp@@ oil the child — this is in P@@ ro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the ob@@ vi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally speak@@ ing , to sub@@ ject children to pain and violence and publi@@ c hum@@ il@@ i@@ ation as a way of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging heal@@ thy emo@@ tional develop@@ ment and good behav@@ ior ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the not@@ ion of well-being is truly un@@ defin@@ ed , and se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly per@@ p@@ et@@ ually op@@ en to be re@@ -@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed ."
"And so , how ther@@ e@@ fore can there be an ob@@ jec@@ tive not@@ ion of well-being ?"
"Well , cons@@ ider by anal@@ og@@ y , the con@@ cept of physical health ."
The con@@ cept of physical health is un@@ defin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from M@@ i@@ cha@@ el S@@ p@@ ec@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
Wh@@ en this stat@@ ue was car@@ ved the average life expec@@ tan@@ cy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 8@@ 0 in the developed world .
There may come a time when we med@@ dle with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to ru@@ n a mar@@ a@@ th@@ on at age 200 will be cons@@ id@@ er@@ ed a pro@@ found di@@ sa@@ bil@@ ity .
People will sen@@ d you don@@ ations when you &apos;re in that con@@ d@@ ition .
"( Laughter ) N@@ ot@@ ice that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is op@@ en , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely op@@ en for re@@ vision , does not make it vac@@ u@@ ous ."
The dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between a heal@@ thy person and a de@@ ad one is about as c@@ lear and con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al as any we make in science .
A@@ n@@ other thing to not@@ ice is there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the moral l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e : There may be equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent ways to th@@ r@@ ive ; there may be equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent ways to organ@@ ize a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ min@@ e an ob@@ jec@@ tive moral@@ ity ?"
Well think of how we talk about f@@ ood : I would never be tem@@ p@@ ted to arg@@ ue to you that there must be one right f@@ ood to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a ran@@ ge of materi@@ als that con@@ st@@ it@@ ute heal@@ thy f@@ ood .
But there &apos;s n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess a c@@ lear dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between f@@ ood and po@@ is@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ w@@ ers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is f@@ ood ? &quot; &quot; does not tem@@ p@@ t us to say that there are no tr@@ u@@ ths to be known about human n@@ ut@@ r@@ ition ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a univer@@ sa@@ l moral@@ ity would requ@@ ire moral pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ mit of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for inst@@ ance , if it &apos;s really wrong to li@@ e , it must always be wrong to li@@ e , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral tr@@ uth ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ s@@ ider , by anal@@ og@@ y , the game of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to pl@@ ay good ch@@ ess , a princi@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t l@@ ose your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mo@@ ments when l@@ os@@ ing your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en is a br@@ il@@ li@@ ant thing to do .
There are mo@@ ments when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a do@@ ma@@ in of per@@ fect ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this br@@ ings us to the sor@@ ts of mov@@ es that people are ap@@ t to make in the moral sp@@ here ."
Con@@ s@@ ider the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ di@@ es : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can c@@ over them up .
"Now , it is the position , gener@@ ally speak@@ ing , of our int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ al commun@@ ity that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ os@@ ton or P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , who are we to say that the pro@@ u@@ d den@@ iz@@ ens of an an@@ ci@@ ent culture are wrong to force their w@@ iv@@ es and dau@@ gh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with l@@ en@@ g@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or th@@ row b@@ att@@ ery ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they de@@ cl@@ ine the pr@@ ivil@@ e@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pret@@ end that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be n@@ on@@ -@@ j@@ ud@@ g@@ mental about a pra@@ c@@ tice like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary we@@ ar@@ ing of a ve@@ il — women should be able to we@@ ar wh@@ at@@ ever they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ c@@ er@@ ned ."
"But what does vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary mean in a commun@@ ity where , when a girl gets ra@@ ped , her father &apos;s first im@@ pul@@ se , rather of@@ ten , is to m@@ ur@@ der her out of sh@@ ame ?"
"@@ Just let that fact det@@ on@@ ate in your brain for a min@@ ute : Y@@ our daughter gets ra@@ ped , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ pres@@ ents a pe@@ ak of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the per@@ fect sol@@ ution in our own society ."
"For inst@@ ance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a new@@ s@@ st@@ and almost any@@ where in the civiliz@@ ed world ."
"Now , gr@@ an@@ ted , for many men it may requ@@ ire a de@@ g@@ ree in ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ y to see something wrong with these imag@@ es ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the per@@ fect ex@@ pres@@ sion of psych@@ ological bal@@ ance with re@@ sp@@ ect to vari@@ ab@@ les like y@@ ou@@ th and be@@ a@@ ut@@ y and women &apos;s bo@@ di@@ es ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ ti@@ mal environ@@ ment in which to ra@@ ise our children ?"
"@@ P@@ rob@@ ably not . O@@ K , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spec@@ tr@@ um between these two extre@@ m@@ es that re@@ pres@@ ents a place of better bal@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ h@@ aps there are many such plac@@ es — again , giv@@ en other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the moral l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e ."
But the thing to not@@ ice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ ak .
"Now the i@@ ron@@ y , from my per@@ spec@@ tive , is that the only people who seem to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions are religi@@ ous de@@ mag@@ og@@ ues of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions because they got these ans@@ w@@ ers from a vo@@ ice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ w@@ ind , not because they made an intellig@@ ent anal@@ y@@ sis of the c@@ a@@ us@@ es and con@@ d@@ ition of human and an@@ ima@@ l well-being ."
"In fact , the end@@ ur@@ ance of relig@@ ion as a l@@ ens through which most people view moral questions has se@@ par@@ ated most moral talk from real questions of human and an@@ ima@@ l suf@@ fer@@ ing ."
This is why we sp@@ end our time talking about things like ga@@ y marri@@ age and not about gen@@ oc@@ ide or n@@ uc@@ lear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or pov@@ erty or any other hu@@ g@@ ely con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al issue .
But the de@@ mag@@ og@@ ues are right about one thing : We need a univer@@ sa@@ l con@@ cep@@ tion of human val@@ ues .
"Now , what st@@ ands in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to not@@ ice is that we do something different when talking about moral@@ ity — es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally sec@@ ul@@ ar , ac@@ ade@@ mic , scient@@ ist typ@@ es ."
Wh@@ en talking about moral@@ ity we val@@ ue differ@@ ences of op@@ in@@ ion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other are@@ a of our lives .
"So , for inst@@ ance the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ am@@ a gets up every mor@@ ning med@@ it@@ ating on compassion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ ping other human be@@ ings is an in@@ te@@ gra@@ l comp@@ on@@ ent of human happiness ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y ; T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y was very f@@ ond of ab@@ duc@@ ting and ra@@ ping and t@@ or@@ tur@@ ing and kil@@ l@@ ing young women ."
"So , we ap@@ pe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ in@@ ion about how to prof@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ ost W@@ es@@ tern int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ als look at this sit@@ u@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ am@@ a to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real arg@@ ument that p@@ ot@@ enti@@ ally f@@ all@@ s within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He lik@@ es ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate , he lik@@ es v@@ an@@ il@@ la ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the other . &quot; &quot; N@@ ot@@ ice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a string the@@ or@@ ist .
"If you ask the s@@ mart@@ est physic@@ ists around who is the s@@ mart@@ est physic@@ ist around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics con@@ fer@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing theory is b@@ og@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t res@@ on@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small sc@@ ale .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physic@@ ist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y of string theory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to b@@ el@@ ong to any string theory cl@@ u@@ b that would have me as a mem@@ ber .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ in@@ ions must be ex@@ cl@@ ud@@ ed .
That is what it is to have a do@@ ma@@ in of exp@@ ert@@ ise .
That is what it is for kno@@ w@@ l@@ edge to coun@@ t .
"@@ How have we con@@ vin@@ ced ourselves that in the moral sp@@ here there is no such thing as moral exp@@ ert@@ ise , or moral tal@@ ent , or moral gen@@ i@@ us even ? How have we con@@ vin@@ ced our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ in@@ ion has to coun@@ t ? How have we con@@ vin@@ ced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ jects wor@@ th cons@@ id@@ er@@ ing ?
D@@ o@@ es the Tal@@ ib@@ an have a point of view on physics that is wor@@ th cons@@ id@@ er@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ign@@ or@@ ance any less ob@@ vi@@ ous on the sub@@ ject of human well-being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world need@@ s now ."
"It need@@ s people like ourselves to ad@@ mit that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing , and moral@@ ity rel@@ ates to that do@@ ma@@ in of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for individ@@ u@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beli@@ ef@@ s and des@@ ir@@ es that rel@@ i@@ ably le@@ ad to need@@ less human suf@@ fer@@ ing ."
Just ad@@ mit@@ ting this will trans@@ form our dis@@ course about moral@@ ity .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies between na@@ tions mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world fil@@ led with des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ inv@@ ent@@ ed ; it will always be eas@@ i@@ er to bre@@ ak things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It seems to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , pat@@ ently ob@@ vi@@ ous that we can no more re@@ sp@@ ect and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in not@@ ions of human well-being than we can re@@ sp@@ ect or t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in the not@@ ions about how disease sp@@ read@@ s , or in the saf@@ ety stan@@ dar@@ ds of buil@@ d@@ ings and air@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must con@@ ver@@ ge on the ans@@ w@@ ers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ mit that these questions have ans@@ w@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris A@@ nd@@ er@@ son : So , some com@@ b@@ us@@ ti@@ ble material there ."
"Wh@@ ether in this audi@@ ence or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , he@@ ar@@ ing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ ra@@ ge thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age seems to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women d@@ res@@ sed in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ."
"I &apos;ve liv@@ ed in the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , sp@@ o@@ ken with a lot of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a cel@@ eb@@ ra@@ tion of f@@ em@@ ale speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a res@@ ult of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is arg@@ u@@ ably a so@@ ph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated psych@@ ological view — &quot; that mal@@ e l@@ ust is not to be tr@@ ust@@ ed . &quot;"
"S@@ am H@@ ar@@ ris : Y@@ e@@ ah , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a s@@ ent@@ ence , wat@@ ch@@ ing the c@@ loc@@ k tic@@ king , but the question is : What is vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary in a cont@@ ex@@ t where men have certain expec@@ t@@ ations , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to we@@ ar a ve@@ il , or a very fun@@ ny h@@ at , or t@@ at@@ too their face — I think we should be f@@ ree to vol@@ un@@ t@@ ar@@ ily do wh@@ at@@ ever we want , but we have to be hon@@ est about the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that these women are plac@@ ed under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ag@@ er to always take their word for it , es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re we@@ ar@@ ing a ful@@ l bur@@ q@@ a ."
C@@ A : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of moral progress .
But can you re@@ con@@ c@@ ile that ?
"I think I underst@@ ood you to say that you could re@@ con@@ c@@ ile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimen@@ si@@ onal , where we all have to think the same ."
"@@ P@@ ain@@ t your picture of what ro@@ l@@ l@@ ing the c@@ loc@@ k 50 years for@@ ward , 100 years for@@ ward , how you would like to think of the world , bal@@ an@@ c@@ ing moral progress with ri@@ chn@@ ess ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ mit that we are on the pat@@ h to@@ ward understanding our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important deta@@ il , then you have to ad@@ mit that we are going to understand all of the positive and nega@@ tive qu@@ al@@ ities of ourselves in much gre@@ ater deta@@ il ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emo@@ tion like em@@ pa@@ thy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge it — whether they &apos;re gen@@ e@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic sy@@ st@@ ems , and in@@ sof@@ ar as we be@@ g@@ in to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably going to con@@ ver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gra@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my daughter from bir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ f@@ ident and well-@@ educ@@ ated in the cont@@ ex@@ t of men who do des@@ ire women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that com@@ pul@@ s@@ ory ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone inv@@ ol@@ ved and actually inter@@ ro@@ ga@@ te them .
Do people love their dau@@ gh@@ ters just as much in these sy@@ st@@ ems ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ w@@ ers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ par@@ ed to shi@@ ft your inst@@ inc@@ tive cur@@ r@@ ent j@@ ud@@ g@@ ment on some of these issu@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well ye@@ ah , mod@@ ul@@ o one ob@@ vi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a truly del@@ us@@ i@@ onal beli@@ ef system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my ga@@ y son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a bo@@ y@@ fri@@ end , I ch@@ op@@ ped his head off . And that was the most compas@@ sion@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; I@@ f you get all those parts al@@ ign@@ ed , y@@ es I think you could probably be feel@@ ing the emo@@ tion of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larg@@ er cont@@ ex@@ t ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feel@@ ing ec@@ st@@ as@@ y and then blo@@ wing h@@ im@@ self up on a b@@ us ."
"C@@ A : S@@ am , this is a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion I would actually love to contin@@ ue for h@@ ours ."
"We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TE@@ D ."

The first h@@ ou@@ se ever built on a b@@ loc@@ k is h@@ ou@@ se number one .
The second h@@ ou@@ se ever built is h@@ ou@@ se number two .
"Th@@ ir@@ d is h@@ ou@@ se number three . It &apos;s easy .
