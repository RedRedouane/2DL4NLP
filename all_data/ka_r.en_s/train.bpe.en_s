"We live in difficult and challen@@ ging economic times , of course ."
"And one of the first vic@@ tim@@ s of difficult economic times , I think , is publi@@ c sp@@ end@@ ing of any kind , but cert@@ ain@@ ly in the fir@@ ing line at the moment is publi@@ c sp@@ end@@ ing for science , and particul@@ arly cur@@ i@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ led science and expl@@ or@@ ation ."
So I want to try and con@@ vin@@ ce you in about 15 minutes that that &apos;s a r@@ id@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous and l@@ ud@@ ic@@ ro@@ us thing to do .
"But I think to set the scen@@ e , I want to show — the next sl@@ ide is not my att@@ emp@@ t to show the wor@@ st TE@@ D sl@@ ide in the history of TE@@ D , but it is a bit of a m@@ ess ."
"( Laughter ) But actually , it &apos;s not my fa@@ ult ; it &apos;s from the G@@ uar@@ dian new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ."
And it &apos;s actually a beautiful demon@@ stra@@ tion of how much science c@@ os@@ ts .
"Because , if I &apos;m going to make the case for contin@@ u@@ ing to sp@@ end on cur@@ i@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ driv@@ en science and expl@@ or@@ ation , I should tell you how much it c@@ os@@ ts ."
So this is a game called &quot; &quot; sp@@ ot the science b@@ ud@@ gets . &quot; &quot; This is the U.@@ K@@ . govern@@ ment sp@@ end .
"You see there , it &apos;s about 6@@ 20 billion a year ."
"The science b@@ ud@@ get is actually — if you look to your left , there &apos;s a pur@@ ple set of bl@@ obs and then y@@ ell@@ ow set of bl@@ obs ."
And it &apos;s one of the y@@ ell@@ ow set of bl@@ obs around the big y@@ ell@@ ow blo@@ b .
It &apos;s about 3@@ .@@ 3 billion p@@ oun@@ ds per year out of 6@@ 20 billion .
That fun@@ ds everything in the U.@@ K@@ .
"@@ from med@@ ical research , space expl@@ or@@ ation , where I work , at C@@ E@@ R@@ N in G@@ en@@ eva , partic@@ le physics , engine@@ er@@ ing , even ar@@ ts and hum@@ an@@ ities , f@@ und@@ ed from the science b@@ ud@@ get , which is that 3@@ .@@ 3 billion , that little , tiny y@@ ell@@ ow blo@@ b around the or@@ an@@ ge blo@@ b at the top left of the scre@@ en ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arg@@ u@@ ing about .
"That per@@ cent@@ age , by the way , is about the same in the U.S. and G@@ er@@ many and F@@ ran@@ ce ."
"@@ R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; D in tot@@ al in the econom@@ y , publ@@ ic@@ ly f@@ und@@ ed , is about 0@@ .@@ 6 percent of G@@ D@@ P ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arg@@ u@@ ing about .
"The first thing I want to say , and this is stra@@ ight from &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem , &quot; &quot; is that our expl@@ or@@ ation of the solar system and the universe has sho@@ wn us that it is in@@ describ@@ ably beautiful ."
"This is a picture that actually was s@@ ent back by the C@@ as@@ s@@ ini space pro@@ be around S@@ at@@ ur@@ n , after we &apos;d fin@@ i@@ shed fil@@ ming &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem . &quot; &quot; So it isn &apos;t in the ser@@ ies ."
It &apos;s of the moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
"So that big s@@ wee@@ ping , wh@@ ite sp@@ here in the cor@@ ner is S@@ at@@ ur@@ n , which is actually in the bac@@ k@@ ground of the picture ."
"And that c@@ res@@ cent there is the moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , which is about as big as the Brit@@ ish I@@ s@@ les ."
It &apos;s about 5@@ 00 kilo@@ met@@ ers in di@@ ame@@ ter .
"So , tiny moon ."
What &apos;s fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating and beautiful ...
"@@ this an un@@ proc@@ ess@@ ed picture , by the way , I should say , it &apos;s black and wh@@ ite , stra@@ ight from S@@ at@@ ur@@ ni@@ an or@@ bit ."
"What &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the lim@@ b there some f@@ ain@@ t , sort of , w@@ is@@ ps of almost s@@ mo@@ ke ris@@ ing up from the lim@@ b ."
This is how we vis@@ u@@ al@@ ize that in &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful gra@@ ph@@ ic .
What we found out were that those f@@ ain@@ t w@@ is@@ ps are actually f@@ oun@@ t@@ ains of ice ris@@ ing up from the sur@@ face of this tiny moon .
"That &apos;s fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the me@@ chan@@ ism for po@@ wer@@ ing those f@@ oun@@ t@@ ains requ@@ ir@@ es there to be l@@ ak@@ es of li@@ qu@@ id water ben@@ e@@ ath the sur@@ face of this moon ."
"And what &apos;s important about that is that , on our planet , on Earth , wh@@ er@@ ever we find li@@ qu@@ id water , we find life ."
"So , to find strong evidence of li@@ qu@@ id , po@@ ols of li@@ qu@@ id , ben@@ e@@ ath the sur@@ face of a moon 7@@ 50 million mil@@ es away from the Earth is really quite ast@@ ou@@ nd@@ ing ."
"So what we &apos;re saying , essenti@@ ally , is maybe that &apos;s a h@@ ab@@ it@@ at for life in the solar system ."
"Well , let me just say , that was a gra@@ ph@@ ic . I just want to show this picture ."
That &apos;s one more picture of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
This is when C@@ as@@ s@@ ini fle@@ w ben@@ e@@ ath En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
"So it made a very low pas@@ s , just a few hundred kilo@@ met@@ ers ab@@ ove the sur@@ face ."
"And so this , again , a real picture of the ice f@@ oun@@ t@@ ains ris@@ ing up into space , absol@@ ut@@ ely beautiful ."
But that &apos;s not the pri@@ me can@@ dida@@ te for life in the solar system .
"That &apos;s probably this place , which is a moon of J@@ up@@ it@@ er , Eu@@ rop@@ a ."
"And again , we had to f@@ ly to the J@@ ov@@ ian system to get any sense that this moon , as most mo@@ ons , was anything other than a de@@ ad b@@ all of ro@@ c@@ k ."
It &apos;s actually an ice moon .
"So what you &apos;re looking at is the sur@@ face of the moon Eu@@ rop@@ a , which is a th@@ ic@@ k she@@ et of ice , probably a hundred kilo@@ met@@ ers th@@ ic@@ k ."
"But by meas@@ uring the way that Eu@@ rop@@ a inter@@ ac@@ ts with the magnetic field of J@@ up@@ it@@ er , and looking at how those cra@@ c@@ ks in the ice that you can see there on that gra@@ ph@@ ic move around , we &apos;ve in@@ fer@@ red very st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly that there &apos;s an oc@@ e@@ an of li@@ qu@@ id sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing the enti@@ re sur@@ face of Eu@@ rop@@ a ."
"So b@@ el@@ ow the ice , there &apos;s an oc@@ e@@ an of li@@ qu@@ id around the whole moon ."
"It could be hund@@ re@@ ds of kilo@@ met@@ ers de@@ ep , we think ."
"We think it &apos;s sal@@ tw@@ ater , and that would mean that there &apos;s more water on that moon of J@@ up@@ it@@ er than there is in all the oc@@ e@@ ans of the Earth com@@ b@@ ined ."
"So that place , a little moon around J@@ up@@ it@@ er , is probably the pri@@ me can@@ dida@@ te for fin@@ ding life on a moon or a body outside the Earth , that we know of ."
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous and beautiful disc@@ ov@@ ery .
O@@ ur expl@@ or@@ ation of the solar system has t@@ au@@ ght us that the solar system is beautiful .
"It may also have poin@@ ted the way to ans@@ wer@@ ing one of the most pro@@ found questions that you can possi@@ bly ask , which is : &quot; &quot; A@@ re we alone in the universe ? &quot; &quot; I@@ s there any other use to expl@@ or@@ ation and science , other than just a sense of won@@ der ?"
"Well , there is ."
"This is a very famo@@ us picture taken , actually , on my first Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ mas E@@ ve , D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 4@@ th , 19@@ 6@@ 8 , when I was about eight months old ."
It was taken by Ap@@ ol@@ lo 8 as it went around the back of the moon .
Ear@@ th@@ r@@ ise from Ap@@ ol@@ lo 8 .
"A famo@@ us picture ; many people have said that it &apos;s the picture that sav@@ ed 19@@ 6@@ 8 , which was a tur@@ b@@ ul@@ ent year — the stud@@ ent ri@@ ots in P@@ aris , the he@@ ight of the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am War ."
"The reason many people think that about this picture , and A@@ l G@@ ore has said it many times , actually , on the st@@ age at TE@@ D , is that this picture , arg@@ u@@ ably , was the beginning of the environ@@ mental movement ."
"Because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a sol@@ id , im@@ mov@@ able , kind of in@@ des@@ tr@@ uc@@ ti@@ ble place , but as a very small , fra@@ g@@ il@@ e-@@ looking world just h@@ ang@@ ing against the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ ness of space ."
"What &apos;s also not of@@ ten said about the space expl@@ or@@ ation , about the Ap@@ ol@@ lo prog@@ ram , is the economic con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion it made ."
"I mean while you can make arg@@ um@@ ents that it was wonderful and a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous achi@@ ev@@ ement and del@@ iver@@ ed pic@@ tures like this , it cost a lot , didn &apos;t it ?"
"Well , actually , many studies have been done about the economic ef@@ fec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess , the economic im@@ p@@ act of Ap@@ ol@@ lo ."
The big@@ gest one was in 19@@ 7@@ 5 by Ch@@ ase E@@ con@@ ome@@ tr@@ ics .
"And it showed that for every $ 1 sp@@ ent on Ap@@ ol@@ lo , 14 came back into the U.S. econom@@ y ."
"So the Ap@@ ol@@ lo prog@@ ram pa@@ id for itself in in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion , in engine@@ er@@ ing , achi@@ ev@@ ement and , I think , in in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing young scient@@ ists and engine@@ ers 14 times over ."
So expl@@ or@@ ation can pa@@ y for itself .
What about sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic disc@@ ov@@ ery ?
What about driv@@ ing in@@ nov@@ ation ?
"Well , this looks like a picture of vir@@ tually nothing ."
"What it is , is a picture of the spec@@ tr@@ um of hy@@ d@@ rog@@ en ."
"S@@ e@@ e , back in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s , 18@@ 9@@ 0s , many scient@@ ists , many observ@@ ers , looked at the light giv@@ en off from atoms ."
And they saw strange pic@@ tures like this .
"What you &apos;re see@@ ing when you put it through a pris@@ m is that you he@@ at hy@@ d@@ rog@@ en up and it doesn &apos;t just gl@@ ow like a wh@@ ite light , it just em@@ its light at particular col@@ ors , a red one , a light bl@@ ue one , some dark bl@@ ue ones ."
Now that led to an understanding of at@@ omi@@ c struc@@ ture because the way that &apos;s expl@@ ained is atoms are a single n@@ uc@@ le@@ us with elec@@ t@@ rons going around them .
And the elec@@ t@@ rons can only be in particular plac@@ es .
"And when they j@@ um@@ p up to the next place they can be , and f@@ all back down again , they em@@ it light at particular col@@ ors ."
"And so the fact that atoms , when you he@@ at them up , only em@@ it light at very spec@@ if@@ ic col@@ ors , was one of the k@@ ey driv@@ ers that led to the develop@@ ment of the quantum theory , the theory of the struc@@ ture of atoms ."
I just wanted to show this picture because this is re@@ mark@@ able .
This is actually a picture of the spec@@ tr@@ um of the Sun .
"And now , this is a picture of atoms in the Sun &apos;s at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing light ."
"And again , they only ab@@ sor@@ b light at particular col@@ ors when elec@@ t@@ rons j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down , j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down ."
But look at the number of black l@@ ines in that spec@@ tr@@ um .
And the el@@ ement h@@ eli@@ um was disc@@ over@@ ed just by star@@ ing at the light from the Sun because some of those black l@@ ines were found that cor@@ respon@@ ded to no known el@@ ement .
And that &apos;s why h@@ eli@@ um &apos;s called h@@ eli@@ um .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; h@@ eli@@ os &quot; &quot; — h@@ eli@@ os from the Sun .
"Now , that s@@ oun@@ ds es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic , and inde@@ ed it was an es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic pur@@ su@@ it , but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behav@@ i@@ ors of elec@@ t@@ rons in materi@@ als like sil@@ ic@@ on , for example ."
"The way that sil@@ ic@@ on behav@@ es , the fact that you can build trans@@ ist@@ ors , is a pur@@ ely quantum ph@@ enom@@ en@@ on ."
"So without that cur@@ i@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ driv@@ en understanding of the struc@@ ture of atoms , which led to this rather es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic theory , quantum me@@ chan@@ ics , then we wouldn &apos;t have trans@@ ist@@ ors , we wouldn &apos;t have sil@@ ic@@ on ch@@ i@@ ps , we wouldn &apos;t have pretty much the bas@@ is of our modern econom@@ y ."
"There &apos;s one more , I think , wonderful tw@@ ist to that tal@@ e ."
"In &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem , &quot; &quot; we ke@@ p@@ t em@@ ph@@ as@@ iz@@ ing the la@@ ws of physics are univer@@ sa@@ l ."
"It &apos;s one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth , is you can tr@@ an@@ spor@@ t it , not only to the planets , but to the most dis@@ tant stars and galaxies ."
"And one of the ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing predic@@ tions of quantum me@@ chan@@ ics , just by looking at the struc@@ ture of atoms — the same theory that describ@@ es trans@@ ist@@ ors — is that there can be no stars in the universe that have re@@ ach@@ ed the end of their life that are big@@ ger than , quite speci@@ fic@@ ally , 1@@ .@@ 4 times the mas@@ s of the Sun ."
That &apos;s a lim@@ it im@@ posed on the mas@@ s of stars .
"You can work it out on a piece of p@@ ap@@ er in a labor@@ at@@ ory , get a t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e , s@@ wing it to the sk@@ y , and you find that there are no de@@ ad stars big@@ ger than 1@@ .@@ 4 times the mas@@ s of the Sun ."
That &apos;s quite an incredible predic@@ tion .
What happens when you have a star that &apos;s right on the edge of that mas@@ s ?
"Well , this is a picture of it ."
"This is the picture of a galax@@ y , a common &quot; &quot; our gar@@ den &quot; &quot; galax@@ y with , what , 100 billion stars like our Sun in it ."
It &apos;s just one of bil@@ lions of galaxies in the universe .
"There are a billion stars in the gal@@ ac@@ tic cor@@ e , which is why it &apos;s shin@@ ing out so bri@@ gh@@ tly ."
"This is about 50 million light years away , so one of our ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing galaxies ."
But that b@@ right star there is actually one of the stars in the galax@@ y .
So that star is also 50 million light years away .
"It &apos;s part of that galax@@ y , and it &apos;s shin@@ ing as bri@@ gh@@ tly as the center of the galax@@ y with a billion s@@ un@@ s in it ."
That &apos;s a T@@ yp@@ e I@@ a super@@ nov@@ a expl@@ os@@ ion .
"Now that &apos;s an incredible ph@@ enom@@ ena , because it &apos;s a star that s@@ its there ."
It &apos;s called a car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ oxy@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f .
"It s@@ its there about , say , 1@@ .@@ 3 times the mas@@ s of the Sun ."
"And it has a b@@ in@@ ary comp@@ an@@ ion that goes around it , so a big star , a big b@@ all of ga@@ s ."
"And what it does is it suc@@ ks ga@@ s off its comp@@ an@@ ion star , until it gets to this lim@@ it called the Ch@@ and@@ ra@@ se@@ khar lim@@ it , and then it expl@@ odes ."
"And it expl@@ odes , and it shin@@ es as bri@@ gh@@ tly as a billion s@@ un@@ s for about two weeks , and rel@@ eas@@ es , not only energy , but a hu@@ ge amount of chem@@ ical el@@ ements into the universe ."
"In fact , that one is a car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ oxy@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f ."
"Now , there was no car@@ b@@ on and oxy@@ g@@ en in the universe at the Big Bang ."
And there was no car@@ b@@ on and oxy@@ g@@ en in the universe throu@@ gh@@ out the first gener@@ ation of stars .
"It was made in stars like that , loc@@ ked away and then re@@ turned to the universe in expl@@ os@@ ions like that in order to re@@ con@@ den@@ se into planets , stars , new solar sy@@ st@@ ems and , inde@@ ed , people like us ."
"I think that &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ able demon@@ stra@@ tion of the power and be@@ a@@ ut@@ y and universal@@ ity of the la@@ ws of physics , because we understand that process , because we understand the struc@@ ture of atoms here on Earth ."
"This is a beautiful quot@@ e that I found — we &apos;re talking about ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity there — from A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ er F@@ l@@ em@@ ing : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en I wo@@ ke up just after da@@ wn on S@@ e@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 2@@ 8 , 19@@ 2@@ 8 , I cert@@ ain@@ ly didn &apos;t pl@@ an to re@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ ize all medicine by disc@@ over@@ ing the world &apos;s first an@@ ti@@ bi@@ ot@@ ic . &quot; &quot; Now , the expl@@ or@@ ers of the world of the at@@ om did not int@@ end to inv@@ ent the trans@@ ist@@ or ."
"And they cert@@ ain@@ ly didn &apos;t int@@ end to descri@@ be the me@@ chan@@ ics of super@@ nov@@ a expl@@ os@@ ions , which ev@@ ent@@ ually told us where the buil@@ ding b@@ loc@@ ks of life were sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ ed in the universe ."
"So , I think science can be — ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity is important ."
It can be beautiful . It can re@@ ve@@ al quite ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing things .
"It can also , I think , finally re@@ ve@@ al the most pro@@ found ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the val@@ ue of our home planet ."
This is a spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar picture of our home planet .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet ."
"It looks like S@@ at@@ ur@@ n because , of course , it is ."
It was taken by the C@@ as@@ s@@ ini space pro@@ be .
"But it &apos;s a famo@@ us picture , not because of the be@@ a@@ ut@@ y and ma@@ j@@ es@@ ty of S@@ at@@ ur@@ n &apos;s r@@ ings , but actually because of a tiny , f@@ ain@@ t blo@@ b just h@@ ang@@ ing under@@ ne@@ ath one of the r@@ ings ."
"And if I bl@@ ow it up there , you see it ."
"It looks like a moon , but in fact , it &apos;s a picture of Earth ."
It was a picture of Earth cap@@ tu@@ red in that fra@@ me of S@@ at@@ ur@@ n .
That &apos;s our planet from 7@@ 50 million mil@@ es away .
"I think the Earth has got a strange pro@@ p@@ erty that the far@@ ther away you get from it , the more beautiful it seems ."
But that is not the most dis@@ tant or most famo@@ us picture of our planet .
"It was taken by this thing , which is called the V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ raf@@ t ."
And that &apos;s a picture of me in fron@@ t of it for sc@@ ale .
The V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er is a tiny machine .
"It &apos;s cur@@ r@@ ently 10 billion mil@@ es away from Earth , trans@@ mit@@ ting with that dis@@ h , with the power of 20 wat@@ ts , and we &apos;re still in cont@@ act with it ."
"But it vis@@ ited J@@ up@@ it@@ er , S@@ at@@ ur@@ n , U@@ ran@@ us and Ne@@ p@@ tun@@ e ."
"And after it vis@@ ited all four of those planets , C@@ ar@@ l S@@ a@@ gan , who &apos;s one of my great her@@ o@@ es , had the wonderful idea of turn@@ ing V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er around and tak@@ ing a picture of every planet it had vis@@ ited ."
And it took this picture of Earth .
"Now it &apos;s very hard to see the Earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; P@@ ale B@@ l@@ ue D@@ ot &quot; &quot; picture , but Earth is sus@@ p@@ end@@ ed in that red sh@@ af@@ t of light ."
That &apos;s Earth from four billion mil@@ es away .
"And I &apos;d like to read you what S@@ a@@ gan w@@ ro@@ te about it , just to fin@@ ish , because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to descri@@ be what he saw in that picture that he had taken ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Con@@ s@@ ider again that d@@ ot ."
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
"O@@ n it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was liv@@ ed out their lives ."
"The ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ t@@ es of jo@@ y and suf@@ fer@@ ing thousands of con@@ f@@ ident religi@@ ons , ide@@ olog@@ ies and economic doc@@ tr@@ ines , every h@@ un@@ ter and for@@ ag@@ er , every h@@ ero and co@@ ward , every cre@@ at@@ or and des@@ tro@@ y@@ er of civiliz@@ ation , every king and pe@@ as@@ ant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , h@@ o@@ pe@@ ful child , inv@@ ent@@ or and expl@@ or@@ er , every teacher of moral@@ s , every cor@@ r@@ up@@ t polit@@ ic@@ ian , every super@@ star , every su@@ pre@@ me lead@@ er , every sa@@ in@@ t and sin@@ ner in the history of our spec@@ ies , liv@@ ed there , on a mo@@ te of d@@ ust , sus@@ p@@ end@@ ed in a s@@ un@@ be@@ am ."
It &apos;s been said that ast@@ ronom@@ y &apos;s a hum@@ bl@@ ing and char@@ ac@@ ter@@ -@@ buil@@ ding experience .
There is perhaps no better demon@@ stra@@ tion of the fol@@ ly of human con@@ ce@@ its than this dis@@ tant imag@@ e of our tiny world .
"T@@ o me , it under@@ sc@@ or@@ es our responsi@@ bil@@ ity to de@@ al more kin@@ d@@ ly with one another and to pres@@ er@@ ve and cher@@ ish the p@@ ale bl@@ ue d@@ ot , the only home we &apos;ve ever known . &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ auti@@ ful words about the power of science and expl@@ or@@ ation ."
"The arg@@ ument has always been made , and it will always be made , that we know enough about the universe ."
You could have made it in the 19@@ 20@@ s ; you wouldn &apos;t have had pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
You could have made it in the 18@@ 9@@ 0s ; you wouldn &apos;t have the trans@@ ist@@ or .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
"S@@ ur@@ ely , we know enough ."
We don &apos;t need to disc@@ over anything else about our universe .
"@@ Let me leave the last words to someone who &apos;s ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly becom@@ ing a h@@ ero of min@@ e , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who did his science at the turn of the 19@@ th century ."
He was c@@ lear@@ ly under as@@ sa@@ ult all the time .
&quot; &quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19@@ th century .
"@@ Just expl@@ o@@ it it ; just build things . &quot; &quot; He said this , he said , &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ thing is more f@@ at@@ al to the progress of the human mind than to pres@@ u@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ ti@@ mate , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complet@@ e , that there are no my@@ st@@ er@@ ies in nature , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."

"I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the Un@@ iver@@ s@@ ity of C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia ."
Just think about this problem for a second .
"@@ Here is a l@@ um@@ p of fl@@ esh , about three p@@ oun@@ ds , which you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand ."
But it can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ ell@@ ar space .
"It can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity , ask questions about the me@@ an@@ ing of its own ex@@ ist@@ ence , about the nature of G@@ od ."
And this is truly the most ama@@ zing thing in the world .
It &apos;s the gre@@ at@@ est my@@ st@@ ery con@@ fron@@ ting human be@@ ings : How does this all come about ?
"Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons ."
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the ad@@ ult human brain .
"And each neuro@@ n makes something like 1@@ ,000 to 1@@ 0,000 cont@@ ac@@ ts with other neurons in the brain ."
"And based on this , people have cal@@ cul@@ ated that the number of per@@ m@@ ut@@ ations and com@@ b@@ in@@ ations of brain acti@@ vity ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ s the number of el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary particles in the universe ."
"So , how do you go about stud@@ ying the brain ?"
"One approach is to look at patients who had les@@ ions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behav@@ ior ."
This is what I sp@@ o@@ ke about in the last TE@@ D .
"@@ To@@ day I &apos;ll talk about a different approach , which is to put elec@@ tro@@ des in different parts of the brain , and actually rec@@ or@@ d the acti@@ vity of individ@@ ual ner@@ ve cells in the brain ."
S@@ or@@ t of e@@ av@@ es@@ drop on the acti@@ vity of ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
"Now , one rec@@ ent disc@@ ov@@ ery that has been made by rese@@ arch@@ ers in I@@ tal@@ y , in P@@ ar@@ ma , by G@@ i@@ ac@@ omo R@@ iz@@ z@@ ol@@ at@@ ti and his colle@@ ag@@ ues , is a group of neurons called mir@@ ro@@ r neurons , which are on the fron@@ t of the brain in the fron@@ t@@ al l@@ ob@@ es ."
"Now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary mo@@ tor com@@ m@@ and neurons in the fron@@ t of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years ."
These neurons will fire when a person per@@ for@@ ms a spec@@ if@@ ic action .
"For example , if I do that , and re@@ ach and gra@@ b an ap@@ ple , a mo@@ tor com@@ m@@ and neuro@@ n in the fron@@ t of my brain will fire ."
"If I re@@ ach out and pul@@ l an ob@@ ject , another neuro@@ n will fire , com@@ man@@ ding me to pul@@ l that ob@@ ject ."
These are called mo@@ tor com@@ m@@ and neurons that have been known for a long time .
"But what R@@ iz@@ z@@ ol@@ at@@ ti found was a sub@@ set of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when I &apos;m looking at somebody else per@@ form@@ ing the same action ."
"So , here is a neuro@@ n that fir@@ es when I re@@ ach and gra@@ b something , but it also fir@@ es when I watch Jo@@ e re@@ ach@@ ing and gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing something ."
And this is truly ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing .
Because it &apos;s as though this neuro@@ n is ad@@ op@@ ting the other person &apos;s point of view .
It &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s per@@ form@@ ing a vir@@ tu@@ al reality sim@@ ul@@ ation of the other person &apos;s action .
"Now , what is the sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance of these mir@@ ro@@ r neurons ?"
F@@ or one thing they must be inv@@ ol@@ ved in things like im@@ itation and em@@ ul@@ ation .
Because to im@@ it@@ ate a compl@@ e@@ x act requ@@ ir@@ es my brain to ad@@ op@@ t the other person &apos;s point of view .
"So , this is important for im@@ itation and em@@ ul@@ ation ."
"Well , why is that important ?"
"Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next sl@@ ide ."
"So , how do you do im@@ itation ? Why is im@@ itation important ?"
"M@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons and im@@ itation , em@@ ul@@ ation ."
"Now , let &apos;s look at culture , the ph@@ enom@@ en@@ on of human culture ."
"If you go back in time about &#91; 7@@ 5@@ ,000 &#93; to 10@@ 0,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 7@@ 5@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And that is , there is a su@@ d@@ den emer@@ g@@ ence and ra@@ p@@ id sp@@ read of a number of sk@@ il@@ ls that are uni@@ qu@@ e to human be@@ ings like to@@ ol use , the use of fire , the use of sh@@ el@@ ters , and , of course , language , and the abil@@ ity to read somebody else &apos;s mind and inter@@ pre@@ t that person &apos;s behav@@ ior ."
A@@ ll of that happened relati@@ vely quickly .
"E@@ v@@ en though the human brain had achi@@ ev@@ ed its pres@@ ent si@@ ze almost three or four hundred thou@@ s@@ and years ago , 10@@ 0,000 years ago all of this happened very , very quickly ."
"And I cl@@ a@@ im that what happened was the su@@ d@@ den emer@@ g@@ ence of a so@@ ph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated mir@@ ro@@ r neuro@@ n system , which allowed you to em@@ ul@@ ate and im@@ it@@ ate other people &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"So that when there was a su@@ d@@ den acc@@ id@@ ental disc@@ ov@@ ery by one mem@@ ber of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular typ@@ e of to@@ ol , instead of d@@ ying out , this sp@@ read ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly , horiz@@ on@@ t@@ ally across the population , or was trans@@ mit@@ ted ver@@ tically , down the gener@@ ations ."
"So , this made evolution su@@ d@@ den@@ ly L@@ am@@ ar@@ c@@ k@@ ian , instead of D@@ ar@@ w@@ in@@ ian ."
D@@ ar@@ w@@ in@@ ian evolution is s@@ low ; it takes hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of years .
"A pol@@ ar be@@ ar , to evol@@ ve a co@@ at , will take thousands of gener@@ ations , maybe 10@@ 0,000 years ."
"A human being , a child , can just watch its par@@ ent k@@ ill another pol@@ ar be@@ ar , and sk@@ in it and put the sk@@ in on its body , f@@ ur on the body , and learn it in one ste@@ p . What the pol@@ ar be@@ ar took 10@@ 0,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes ."
And then once it &apos;s learned this it sp@@ read@@ s in ge@@ ome@@ tri@@ c pro@@ por@@ tion across a population .
This is the bas@@ is . The im@@ itation of compl@@ e@@ x sk@@ il@@ ls is what we call culture and is the bas@@ is of civiliz@@ ation .
"Now there is another kind of mir@@ ro@@ r neuro@@ n , which is inv@@ ol@@ ved in something quite different ."
"And that is , there are mir@@ ro@@ r neurons , just as there are mir@@ ro@@ r neurons for action , there are mir@@ ro@@ r neurons for tou@@ ch ."
"In other words , if somebody tou@@ ch@@ es me , my hand , neuro@@ n in the so@@ mat@@ os@@ en@@ s@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x in the sen@@ s@@ ory regi@@ on of the brain fir@@ es ."
"But the same neuro@@ n , in some c@@ as@@ es , will fire when I simply watch another person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , it &apos;s em@@ pa@@ th@@ iz@@ ing the other person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , most of them will fire when I &apos;m tou@@ ched in different loc@@ ations . D@@ if@@ fer@@ ent neurons for different loc@@ ations ."
But a sub@@ set of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being tou@@ ched in the same loc@@ ation .
"So , here again you have neurons which are en@@ ro@@ l@@ led in em@@ pa@@ thy ."
"Now , the question then aris@@ es : I@@ f I simply watch another person being tou@@ ched , why do I not get con@@ f@@ used and liter@@ ally feel that tou@@ ch sen@@ sa@@ tion mer@@ ely by wat@@ ch@@ ing somebody being tou@@ ched ?"
"I mean , I em@@ pa@@ th@@ ize with that person but I don &apos;t liter@@ ally feel the tou@@ ch ."
"Well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got re@@ cep@@ tors in your sk@@ in , tou@@ ch and pain re@@ cep@@ tors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry , you &apos;re not being tou@@ ched ."
"So , em@@ pa@@ th@@ ize , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the tou@@ ch , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise you &apos;ll get con@@ f@@ used and mud@@ dl@@ ed . &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , so there is a fe@@ ed@@ back sign@@ al that v@@ et@@ o@@ es the sign@@ al of the mir@@ ro@@ r neuro@@ n pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing you from con@@ sci@@ ously experiencing that tou@@ ch ."
"But if you re@@ move the ar@@ m , you simply an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze my ar@@ m , so you put an in@@ jec@@ tion into my ar@@ m , an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze the bra@@ ch@@ i@@ al pl@@ ex@@ us , so the ar@@ m is n@@ um@@ b , and there is no sen@@ sa@@ tions coming in , if I now watch you being tou@@ ched , I liter@@ ally feel it in my hand ."
"In other words , you have dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings ."
"So , I call them G@@ and@@ h@@ i neurons , or em@@ pa@@ thy neurons ."
( Laughter ) And this is not in some ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical sense .
"A@@ ll that &apos;s se@@ par@@ ating you from him , from the other person , is your sk@@ in ."
"@@ R@@ emo@@ ve the sk@@ in , you experience that person &apos;s tou@@ ch in your mind ."
You &apos;ve dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings .
"And this , of course , is the bas@@ is of much of E@@ as@@ tern ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ y , and that is there is no real inde@@ p@@ end@@ ent self , al@@ o@@ of from other human be@@ ings , in@@ spec@@ ting the world , in@@ spec@@ ting other people ."
"You are , in fact , connec@@ ted not just v@@ ia F@@ ac@@ eb@@ ook and Inter@@ net , you &apos;re actually quite liter@@ ally connec@@ ted by your neurons ."
"And there is whole ch@@ ains of neurons around this room , talking to each other ."
And there is no real dis@@ tin@@ c@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess of your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness from somebody else &apos;s con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
And this is not m@@ um@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ umb@@ o ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ y .
It emer@@ g@@ es from our understanding of bas@@ ic neuro@@ science .
"So , you have a pati@@ ent with a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b . I@@ f the ar@@ m has been re@@ mov@@ ed and you have a ph@@ an@@ tom , and you watch somebody else being tou@@ ched , you feel it in your ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"Now the ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing thing is , if you have pain in your ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b , you squ@@ e@@ eze the other person &apos;s hand , mas@@ sage the other person &apos;s hand , that rel@@ i@@ ev@@ es the pain in your ph@@ an@@ tom hand , almost as though the neuro@@ n were ob@@ t@@ ain@@ ing rel@@ i@@ ef from mer@@ ely wat@@ ch@@ ing somebody else being mas@@ sa@@ g@@ ed ."
"So , here you have my last sl@@ ide ."
F@@ or the lon@@ gest time people have re@@ gar@@ ded science and hum@@ an@@ ities as being dis@@ tin@@ c@@ t .
"C@@ .@@ P@@ . S@@ now sp@@ o@@ ke of the two cul@@ tures : science on the one hand , hum@@ an@@ ities on the other ; never the t@@ wa@@ in sh@@ all me@@ et ."
"So , I &apos;m saying the mir@@ ro@@ r neuro@@ n system under@@ lies the inter@@ face allo@@ wing you to re@@ think about issu@@ es like con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of self , what se@@ par@@ ates you from other human be@@ ings , what allo@@ ws you to em@@ pa@@ th@@ ize with other human be@@ ings , and also even things like the emer@@ g@@ ence of culture and civiliz@@ ation , which is uni@@ qu@@ e to human be@@ ings . Thank you ."

"It &apos;s a great hon@@ or today to share with you The D@@ ig@@ ital Un@@ iver@@ se , which was created for hum@@ an@@ ity to really see where we are in the universe ."
And so I think we can ro@@ ll the video that we have .
&#91; The H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as . &#93; ( M@@ us@@ ic ) The fl@@ at horiz@@ on that we &apos;ve evol@@ ved with has been a met@@ ap@@ h@@ or for the in@@ fin@@ ite : un@@ b@@ ou@@ nd@@ ed resour@@ ces and un@@ lim@@ ited cap@@ ac@@ ity for dis@@ po@@ sa@@ l of was@@ te .
"It wasn &apos;t until we really left Earth , got ab@@ ove the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here and had seen the horiz@@ on b@@ end back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a lim@@ ited con@@ d@@ ition ."
The D@@ ig@@ ital Un@@ iver@@ se A@@ t@@ l@@ as has been built at the American M@@ us@@ e@@ um of N@@ at@@ ural H@@ ist@@ ory over the past 12 years .
"We main@@ tain that , put that together as a project to really ch@@ art the universe across all sc@@ al@@ es ."
"What we see here are sat@@ el@@ lit@@ es around the Earth and the Earth in pro@@ per re@@ g@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion against the universe , as we see ."
N@@ A@@ S@@ A sup@@ por@@ ted this work 12 years ago as part of the reb@@ u@@ il@@ ding of the H@@ ay@@ den P@@ lan@@ et@@ ari@@ um so that we would share this with the world .
The D@@ ig@@ ital Un@@ iver@@ se is the bas@@ is of our space show produc@@ tions that we do — our ma@@ in space sho@@ ws in the do@@ me .
"But what you see here is the res@@ ult of , actually , inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps that we h@@ os@@ ted with L@@ in@@ k@@ op@@ ing Un@@ iver@@ s@@ ity in Swed@@ en ."
"I &apos;ve had 12 students work on this for their grad@@ u@@ ate work , and the res@@ ult has been this sof@@ tw@@ are called Un@@ iv@@ i@@ ew and a comp@@ any called S@@ C@@ I@@ S@@ S in Swed@@ en ."
"This sof@@ tw@@ are allo@@ ws inter@@ ac@@ tive use , so this ac@@ tu@@ al f@@ light pat@@ h and mo@@ vi@@ e that we see here was actually flo@@ wn live ."
"I cap@@ tu@@ red this live from my l@@ ap@@ top in a c@@ af@@ e called Earth M@@ att@@ ers on the L@@ o@@ wer E@@ ast S@@ ide of M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ tan , where I live , and it was done as a col@@ labor@@ ative project with the R@@ ub@@ in M@@ us@@ e@@ um of H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ an Ar@@ t for an ex@@ h@@ ib@@ it on com@@ par@@ ative c@@ osmo@@ log@@ y ."
"And so as we move out , we see contin@@ u@@ ously from our planet all the way out into the real@@ m of galaxies , as we see here , li@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ tr@@ av@@ el time , giving you a sense of how far away we are ."
"As we move out , the light from these dis@@ tant galaxies have taken so long , we &apos;re essenti@@ ally bac@@ king up into the past ."
We back so far up we &apos;re finally see@@ ing a cont@@ ain@@ ment around us — the af@@ ter@@ gl@@ ow of the Big Bang .
This is the W@@ M@@ A@@ P mic@@ ro@@ w@@ ave bac@@ k@@ ground that we see .
"We &apos;ll f@@ ly outside it here , just to see this sort of cont@@ ain@@ ment ."
"If we were outside this , it would almost be me@@ an@@ ing@@ less , in the sense as before time ."
But this our cont@@ ain@@ ment of the vis@@ ible universe .
We know the universe is big@@ ger than that which we can see .
"C@@ om@@ ing back quickly , we see here the radi@@ o sp@@ here that we j@@ um@@ ped out of in the beginning , but these are pos@@ iti@@ ons , the l@@ at@@ est pos@@ iti@@ ons of ex@@ o@@ planets that we &apos;ve ma@@ pped , and our su@@ n here , ob@@ vi@@ ously , with our own solar system ."
"What you &apos;re going to see — we &apos;re going to have to j@@ um@@ p in here pretty quickly between s@@ ever@@ al ord@@ ers of mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de to get down to where we see the solar system — these are the pa@@ ths of V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er 1 , V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er 2 , P@@ ion@@ e@@ er 1@@ 1 and P@@ ion@@ e@@ er 10 , the first four sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ raf@@ t to have left the solar system ."
"C@@ om@@ ing in cl@@ os@@ er , pic@@ king up Earth , or@@ bit of the M@@ o@@ on , and we see the Earth ."
"This ma@@ p can be up@@ da@@ ted , and we can ad@@ d in new data ."
I know D@@ r@@ . C@@ ar@@ ol@@ y@@ n P@@ or@@ c@@ o is the c@@ amer@@ a P@@ .@@ I@@ .
for the C@@ as@@ s@@ ini mis@@ sion .
"But here we see the compl@@ e@@ x tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory of the C@@ as@@ s@@ ini mis@@ sion col@@ or cod@@ ed for different mis@@ sion ph@@ as@@ es , ing@@ en@@ i@@ ously developed so that 45 en@@ coun@@ ters with the larg@@ est moon , T@@ it@@ an , which is larg@@ er that the planet M@@ er@@ cur@@ y , div@@ ert@@ s the or@@ bit into different parts of mis@@ sion ph@@ ase ."
This sof@@ tw@@ are allo@@ ws us to come cl@@ ose and look at parts of this .
This sof@@ tw@@ are can also be n@@ et@@ worked between dom@@ es .
"We have a gro@@ wing us@@ er b@@ ase of this , and we n@@ et@@ work dom@@ es ."
And we can n@@ et@@ work between dom@@ es and clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms .
We &apos;re actually shar@@ ing t@@ ours of the universe with the first sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an plan@@ et@@ ari@@ um in G@@ h@@ ana as well as new li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies that have been built in the gh@@ et@@ t@@ os in C@@ ol@@ umb@@ ia and a high school in C@@ amb@@ od@@ ia .

"This is an imag@@ e from S@@ at@@ ur@@ day , ph@@ ot@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ ed by the A@@ qu@@ a sat@@ el@@ lit@@ e , but through the Un@@ iv@@ i@@ ew sof@@ tw@@ are ."
So you &apos;re see@@ ing the edge of the Earth .
This is Ne@@ p@@ al .
"This is , in fact , right here is the val@@ ley of L@@ h@@ asa , right here in T@@ ib@@ et ."
But we can see the h@@ aze from fir@@ es and so for@@ th in the G@@ ang@@ es val@@ ley down b@@ el@@ ow in India .
This is Ne@@ p@@ al and T@@ ib@@ et .
"And just in cl@@ os@@ ing , I &apos;d just like to say this beautiful world that we live on — here we see a bit of the s@@ now that some of you may have had to br@@ ave in coming out — so I &apos;d like to just say that what the world need@@ s now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larg@@ er con@@ d@@ ition now and a much larg@@ er sense of what home is ."
"Because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essenti@@ ally ."
We car@@ ry that in us .
"And to be able to see our cont@@ ex@@ t in this larg@@ er sense at all sc@@ al@@ es hel@@ ps us all , I think , in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe ."

"And S@@ mit@@ h says , how would you respon@@ d ?"
How do they dif@@ fer from the rest of us ?
"In two of the three great ar@@ en@@ as of life , by the time L@@ en was 30 , L@@ en was en@@ or@@ mo@@ us@@ ly successful ."
"B@@ y the time he was 20 , he was an op@@ tions trad@@ er ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , in pl@@ ay , he &apos;s a national ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on br@@ id@@ ge play@@ er ."
"And the reason he was , was that L@@ en is a c@@ old f@@ ish ."
What you get out of that is not s@@ mil@@ ey@@ -@@ ness .
"So , that &apos;s the second pat@@ h ."
"This is the most v@@ ener@@ able of the happ@@ in@@ ess@@ es , trad@@ iti@@ on@@ ally ."
"Now , O@@ K , you can op@@ en your ey@@ es ."
"And we ask the question as a fun@@ c@@ tion of the three different lives , how much life sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion do you get ?"
The pur@@ su@@ it of me@@ an@@ ing is the st@@ ron@@ gest .
There &apos;s a group of people in K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
People c@@ ross oc@@ e@@ ans to go see them .
These people are t@@ all .
They j@@ um@@ p high . They we@@ ar red .
And they k@@ ill lions .
"You might be wonder@@ ing , who are these people ?"
These are the M@@ a@@ a@@ sa@@ is .
And you know what &apos;s co@@ ol ? I &apos;m actually one of them .
"The M@@ a@@ a@@ sa@@ is , the bo@@ ys are b@@ rou@@ ght up to be war@@ ri@@ ors ."
The girls are b@@ rou@@ ght up to be mothers .
"When I was five years old , I found out that I was en@@ gag@@ ed to be marri@@ ed as so@@ on as I re@@ ach@@ ed pub@@ erty ."
"M@@ y mother , my grand@@ mother , my a@@ un@@ ties , they con@@ stan@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me that your h@@ us@@ b@@ and just pas@@ sed by ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ o@@ ol , ye@@ ah ?"
And everything I had to do from that moment was to pre@@ p@@ are me to be a per@@ fect woman at age 12 .
"M@@ y day started at 5 in the mor@@ ning , mil@@ king the co@@ ws , s@@ wee@@ ping the h@@ ou@@ se , co@@ o@@ king for my si@@ bl@@ ings , col@@ lec@@ ting water , fi@@ re@@ w@@ ood ."
I did everything that I needed to do to become a per@@ fect wife .
I went to school not because the M@@ a@@ a@@ sa@@ is &apos; women or girls were going to school .
"It &apos;s because my mother was den@@ i@@ ed an education , and she con@@ stan@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me and my si@@ bl@@ ings that she never wanted us to live the life she was liv@@ ing ."
Why did she say that ?
M@@ y father worked as a pol@@ ic@@ e@@ man in the c@@ ity .
He came home once a year .
We didn &apos;t see him for some@@ times even two years .
"And wh@@ en@@ ever he came home , it was a different case ."
M@@ y mother worked hard in the far@@ m to grow c@@ rop@@ s so that we can e@@ at .
She re@@ ar@@ ed the co@@ ws and the go@@ at@@ s so that she can care for us .
"But when my father came , he would s@@ ell the co@@ ws , he would s@@ ell the produc@@ ts we had , and he went and dr@@ ank with his friends in the b@@ ars ."
"Because my mother was a woman , she was not allowed to own any pro@@ p@@ erty , and by de@@ fa@@ ult , everything in my family any@@ way b@@ el@@ on@@ gs to my father , so he had the right ."
"And if my mother ever ques@@ tion@@ ed him , he be@@ at her , ab@@ used her , and really it was difficult ."
"When I went to school , I had a dre@@ am ."
I wanted to become a teacher .
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers looked n@@ ice .
"They we@@ ar n@@ ice d@@ res@@ ses , high@@ -@@ he@@ el@@ ed sho@@ es ."
"I found out later that they are un@@ com@@ for@@ table , but I ad@@ mi@@ red it ."
"( Laughter ) But most of all , the teacher was just writ@@ ing on the bo@@ ard — not hard work , that &apos;s what I thought , com@@ par@@ ed to what I was doing in the far@@ m ."
So I wanted to become a teacher .
"I worked hard in school , but when I was in e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , it was a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ing fac@@ tor ."
"In our trad@@ ition , there is a c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y that girls have to under@@ go to become women , and it &apos;s a r@@ ite of pas@@ sage to w@@ om@@ an@@ h@@ ood ."
"And then I was just fin@@ ish@@ ing my e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , and that was a trans@@ ition for me to go to high school ."
This was the c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ad .
"O@@ n@@ ce I go through this trad@@ ition , I was going to become a wife ."
"Well , my dre@@ am of becom@@ ing a teacher will not come to pas@@ s ."
So I tal@@ ked — I had to come up with a pl@@ an to fig@@ ure these things out .
I tal@@ ked to my father . I did something that most girls have never done .
"I told my father , &quot; &quot; I will only go through this c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y if you let me go back to school . &quot; &quot; The reason why , if I ra@@ n away , my father will have a s@@ ti@@ g@@ ma , people will be call@@ ing him the father of that girl who didn &apos;t go through the c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y ."
It was a sh@@ ame@@ ful thing for him to car@@ ry the rest of his life .
"So he fig@@ ured out . &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; ok@@ ay , you &apos;ll go to school after the c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y . &quot; &quot; I did . The c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y happened ."
It &apos;s a whole wee@@ k long of exc@@ it@@ ement .
It &apos;s a c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y . People are en@@ jo@@ ying it .
"And the day before the ac@@ tu@@ al c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y happens , we were dan@@ c@@ ing , having exc@@ it@@ ement , and through all the ni@@ ght we did not s@@ le@@ ep ."
"The ac@@ tu@@ al day came , and we wal@@ ked out of the h@@ ou@@ se that we were dan@@ c@@ ing in . Y@@ es , we dan@@ ced and dan@@ ced ."
"We wal@@ ked out to the cou@@ rt@@ yar@@ d , and there were a bun@@ ch of people wa@@ iting ."
They were all in a cir@@ cle .
"And as we dan@@ ced and dan@@ ced , and we appro@@ ach@@ ed this cir@@ cle of women , men , women , children , everybody was there ."
"There was a woman sit@@ ting in the middle of it , and this woman was wa@@ iting to hold us ."
"I was the first . There were my s@@ ist@@ ers and a couple of other girls , and as I appro@@ ach@@ ed her , she looked at me , and I sa@@ t down ."
"And I sa@@ t down , and I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ gs ."
"As I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ g , another woman came , and this woman was car@@ r@@ ying a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And as she car@@ ri@@ ed the k@@ ni@@ fe , she wal@@ ked to@@ ward me and she hel@@ d the cl@@ it@@ or@@ is , and she c@@ ut it off ."
"As you can imagine , I bl@@ ed . I bl@@ ed ."
"A@@ f@@ ter b@@ le@@ ed@@ ing for a while , I f@@ ain@@ ted ther@@ e@@ after ."
"It &apos;s something that so many girls — I &apos;m l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , I never di@@ ed — but many di@@ e ."
"It &apos;s pra@@ c@@ tic@@ ed , it &apos;s no an@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia , it &apos;s a ru@@ st@@ y old k@@ ni@@ fe , and it was difficult ."
"I was l@@ uc@@ k@@ y because one , also , my mo@@ m did something that most women don &apos;t do ."
"Th@@ ree days later , after everybody has left the home , my mo@@ m went and b@@ rou@@ ght a n@@ ur@@ se ."
We were taken care of .
"Th@@ ree weeks later , I was heal@@ ed , and I was back in high school ."
I was so de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family .
"Well , while I was in high school , something happened ."
I met a young g@@ ent@@ le@@ man from our village who had been to the Un@@ iver@@ s@@ ity of O@@ re@@ g@@ on .
"This man was we@@ ar@@ ing a wh@@ ite t@@ -@@ shir@@ t , j@@ e@@ ans , c@@ amer@@ a , wh@@ ite s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers — and I &apos;m talking about wh@@ ite s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers ."
"There is something about c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , I think , and sho@@ es ."
"They were s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers , and this is in a village that doesn &apos;t even have p@@ av@@ ed ro@@ ad@@ s . It was quite at@@ trac@@ tive ."
"I told him , &quot; &quot; Well , I want to go to where you are , &quot; &quot; because this man looked very happy , and I ad@@ mi@@ red that ."
"And he told me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you mean , you want to go ?"
"D@@ on &apos;t you have a h@@ us@@ b@@ and wa@@ iting for you ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that part ."
"@@ Just tell me how to get there . &quot; &quot; This g@@ ent@@ le@@ man , he hel@@ ped me ."
"Wh@@ ile I was in high school also , my da@@ d was sic@@ k ."
"He got a st@@ ro@@ ke , and he was really , really sic@@ k , so he really c@@ ouldn &apos;t tell me what to do next ."
"But the problem is , my father is not the only father I have ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body who is my da@@ d &apos;s age , mal@@ e in the commun@@ ity , is my father by de@@ fa@@ ult — my un@@ cles , all of them — and they dic@@ t@@ ate what my future is ."
"So the news came , I app@@ li@@ ed to school and I was ac@@ cep@@ ted to R@@ and@@ ol@@ ph@@ -@@ M@@ ac@@ on W@@ o@@ man &apos;s C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in L@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ bur@@ g , V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , and I c@@ ouldn &apos;t come without the sup@@ port of the village , because I needed to ra@@ ise money to buy the air tic@@ k@@ et ."
I got a s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship but I needed to get myself here .
"But I needed the sup@@ port of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had g@@ ot@@ ten an op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity to go to school , they said , &quot; &quot; What a lost op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity ."
This should have been giv@@ en to a bo@@ y . We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; So I went back and I had to go back to the trad@@ ition .
There &apos;s a beli@@ ef amo@@ n@@ g our people that mor@@ ning br@@ ings good news .
"So I had to come up with something to do with the mor@@ ning , because there &apos;s good news in the mor@@ ning ."
"And in the village also , there is one ch@@ i@@ ef , an el@@ der , who if he says y@@ es , everybody will fol@@ low him ."
"So I went to him very early in the mor@@ ning , as the su@@ n ro@@ se ."
"The first thing he se@@ es when he op@@ ens his do@@ or is , it &apos;s me ."
"&quot; M@@ y child , what are you doing here ? &quot;"
"&quot; Well , D@@ ad , I need help . Can you sup@@ port me to go to America ? &quot;"
"I p@@ rom@@ ised him that I would be the best girl , I will come back , anything they wanted after that , I will do it for them ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , but I can &apos;t do it alone . &quot; &quot; He gave me a l@@ ist of another 15 men that I went — 1@@ 6 more men — every single mor@@ ning I went and vis@@ ited them ."
They all came together .
"The village , the women , the men , everybody came together to sup@@ port me to come to get an education ."
"I ar@@ r@@ iv@@ ed in America . A@@ s you can imagine , what did I find ?"
I found s@@ now !
"I found W@@ al-@@ Mar@@ ts , vac@@ u@@ um c@@ le@@ an@@ ers , and lots of f@@ ood in the c@@ af@@ et@@ eria ."
I was in a l@@ and of pl@@ ent@@ y .
"I en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed myself , but d@@ uring that moment while I was here , I disc@@ over@@ ed a lot of things ."
"I learned that that c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y that I went through when I was 1@@ 3 years old , it was called f@@ em@@ ale gen@@ ital m@@ ut@@ il@@ ation ."
I learned that it was against the la@@ w in K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
I learned that I did not have to tra@@ de part of my body to get an education . I had a right .
"And as we speak right now , three million girls in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a are at ris@@ k of going through this m@@ ut@@ il@@ ation ."
I learned that my mo@@ m had a right to own pro@@ p@@ erty .
I learned that she did not have to be ab@@ used because she is a woman .
Th@@ ose things made me an@@ gr@@ y .
I wanted to do something .
"As I went back , every time I went , I found that my ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors &apos; girls were getting marri@@ ed ."
"They were getting m@@ ut@@ il@@ ated , and here , after I grad@@ u@@ ated from here , I worked at the U.@@ N@@ . , I went back to school to get my grad@@ u@@ ate work , the con@@ st@@ ant c@@ ry of these girls was in my face ."
I had to do something .
"As I went back , I started talking to the men , to the village , and mothers , and I said , &quot; &quot; I want to give back the way I had p@@ rom@@ ised you that I would come back and help you . What do you need ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s I sp@@ o@@ ke to the women , they told me , &quot; You know what we need ? We really need a school for girls . &quot;"
Because there had not been any school for girls .
"And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is ra@@ ped when she &apos;s walking to school , the mother is bl@@ amed for that ."
"If she got pre@@ gn@@ ant before she got marri@@ ed , the mother is bl@@ amed for that , and she &apos;s p@@ uni@@ shed ."
She &apos;s be@@ at@@ en .
"They said , &quot; &quot; We wanted to put our girls in a sa@@ fe place . &quot; &quot; A@@ s we mov@@ ed , and I went to talk to the fa@@ thers , the fa@@ thers , of course , you can imagine what they said : &quot; We want a school for bo@@ ys . &quot;"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have g@@ ot@@ ten an education ."
"Wh@@ y can &apos;t they build a school for bo@@ ys , and I &apos;ll build a school for girls ? &quot; &quot; That made sense . And they ag@@ re@@ ed ."
"And I told them , I wanted them to show me a sig@@ n of com@@ mit@@ ment ."
And they did . They don@@ ated l@@ and where we built the girls &apos; school .
We have .
I want you to me@@ et one of the girls in that school .
"A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ ine came to ap@@ ply for the school , and she did not me@@ et any c@@ rit@@ eria that we had ."
"She &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an . Y@@ es , we could have taken her for that ."
"But she was ol@@ der . She was 12 years old , and we were tak@@ ing girls who were in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
"A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ ine had been mov@@ ing from one place — because she &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an , she has no mother , she has no father — mov@@ ing from one grand@@ mother &apos;s h@@ ou@@ se to another one , from a@@ un@@ ties to a@@ un@@ ties . She had no st@@ abil@@ ity in her life ."
"And I looked at her , I remem@@ ber that day , and I saw something be@@ y@@ ond what I was see@@ ing in A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ ine ."
"And y@@ es , she was ol@@ der to be in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
We gave her the op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity to come to the clas@@ s .
"F@@ ive months later , that is A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ ine ."
A trans@@ forma@@ tion had be@@ gu@@ n in her life .
A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ ine wan@@ ts to be a p@@ il@@ ot so she can f@@ ly around the world and make a difference .
She was not the top stud@@ ent when we took her .
"Now she &apos;s the best stud@@ ent , not just in our school , but in the enti@@ re div@@ is@@ ion that we are in ."
That &apos;s S@@ har@@ on . That &apos;s five years later .
"That &apos;s E@@ vel@@ y@@ n . F@@ ive months later , that is the difference that we are making ."
"As a new da@@ wn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening ."
"As we speak right now , 1@@ 2@@ 5 girls will never be m@@ ut@@ il@@ ated ."
One hundred tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five girls will not be marri@@ ed when they &apos;re 12 years old .
One hundred tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five girls are cre@@ ating and achi@@ ev@@ ing their dre@@ ams .
"This is the thing that we are doing , giving them op@@ por@@ tun@@ ities where they can r@@ ise ."
"As we speak right now , women are not being be@@ at@@ en because of the re@@ vol@@ u@@ tions we &apos;ve started in our commun@@ ity ."
( Applause ) I want to challenge you today .
"You are l@@ ist@@ ening to me because you are here , very op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic ."
You are somebody who is so pas@@ sion@@ ate .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see a better world .
"You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see that war ends , no pov@@ erty ."
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make a difference .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make our to@@ mor@@ row better .
"I want to challenge you today that to be the first , because people will fol@@ low you ."
B@@ e the first . People will fol@@ low you .
B@@ e b@@ old . St@@ and up . B@@ e fe@@ ar@@ less . B@@ e con@@ f@@ ident .
"M@@ ove out , because as you change your world , as you change your commun@@ ity , as we believe that we are im@@ p@@ ac@@ ting one girl , one family , one village , one country at a time ."
"We are making a difference , so if you change your world , you are going to change your commun@@ ity , you are going to change your country , and think about that . I@@ f you do that , and I do that , ar@@ en &apos;t we going to create a better future for our children , for your children , for our grand@@ children ?"
And we will live in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful world . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I have a question for you : A@@ re you religi@@ ous ?
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religi@@ ous person .
"@@ Let &apos;s see , I &apos;d say about three or four percent ."
I had no idea there were so many beli@@ ev@@ ers at a TE@@ D Con@@ fer@@ ence .
"( Laughter ) O@@ kay , here &apos;s another question : Do you think of yourself as sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual in any way , shape or form ? R@@ a@@ ise your hand ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s the ma@@ jor@@ ity ."
M@@ y Tal@@ k today is about self-@@ trans@@ cen@@ den@@ ce .
It &apos;s just a bas@@ ic fact about being human that some@@ times the self seems to just mel@@ t away .
"And when that happens , the feel@@ ing is ec@@ st@@ ati@@ c and we re@@ ach for met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors of up and down to explain these feel@@ ings ."
We talk about being up@@ lif@@ ted or el@@ ev@@ ated .
Now it &apos;s really hard to think about anything ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t like this without a good con@@ cre@@ te met@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
So here &apos;s the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or I &apos;m of@@ fer@@ ing today .
"Th@@ ink about the mind as being like a h@@ ou@@ se with many ro@@ oms , most of which we &apos;re very famil@@ i@@ ar with ."
But some@@ times it &apos;s as though a do@@ or@@ way ap@@ pe@@ ars from out of no@@ where and it op@@ ens on@@ to a stair@@ case .
We c@@ lim@@ b the stair@@ case and experience a state of al@@ tered con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
"In 19@@ 0@@ 2 , the great American psych@@ olog@@ ist W@@ il@@ li@@ am J@@ am@@ es w@@ ro@@ te about the many vari@@ eties of religi@@ ous experience ."
He col@@ lec@@ ted all kinds of case studies .
"One of the most exc@@ iting to me is this young man , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ rad@@ ley , had an en@@ coun@@ ter , he thought , with J@@ es@@ us in 18@@ 20 ."
And here &apos;s what B@@ rad@@ ley said about it .
"( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ rad@@ ley : I thought I saw the sa@@ vi@@ or in human shape for about one second in the room , with ar@@ ms ext@@ end@@ ed , ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ing to say to me , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome . &quot; &quot; The next day I re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ing ."
M@@ y happiness was so great that I said I wanted to di@@ e .
This world had no place in my af@@ fec@@ tions .
"@@ P@@ re@@ vi@@ ous to this time , I was very sel@@ f@@ ish and self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous ."
"But now I des@@ i@@ red the w@@ el@@ f@@ are of all man@@ kind and could , with a feel@@ ing heart , for@@ give my wor@@ st en@@ e@@ mi@@ es ."
"@@ J@@ H : So not@@ e how B@@ rad@@ ley &apos;s p@@ et@@ ty , moral@@ is@@ tic self just di@@ es on the way up the stair@@ case ."
And on this high@@ er level he becom@@ es lov@@ ing and for@@ giving .
The world &apos;s many religi@@ ons have found so many ways to help people c@@ lim@@ b the stair@@ case .
O@@ thers use psych@@ ed@@ el@@ ic dru@@ gs .
This is from a 1@@ 6@@ th century A@@ z@@ te@@ c sc@@ ro@@ ll sho@@ wing a man about to e@@ at a p@@ sil@@ oc@@ y@@ b@@ in m@@ ush@@ room and at the same moment get y@@ an@@ ked up the stair@@ case by a g@@ od .
L@@ ots of people find self-@@ trans@@ cen@@ den@@ ce in nature .
O@@ thers over@@ come their self at rav@@ es .
But here &apos;s the we@@ ir@@ d@@ est place of all : war .
"So many bo@@ o@@ ks about war say the same thing , that nothing br@@ ings people together like war ."
And that br@@ ing@@ ing them together op@@ ens up the possibil@@ ity of ex@@ tra@@ ordinary self-@@ trans@@ c@@ end@@ ent experi@@ ences .
I &apos;m going to pl@@ ay for you an exc@@ er@@ p@@ t from this bo@@ ok by G@@ l@@ en@@ n G@@ ra@@ y .
G@@ ra@@ y was a sol@@ di@@ er in the American ar@@ my in World War I@@ I .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) G@@ l@@ en@@ n G@@ ra@@ y : M@@ any v@@ et@@ er@@ ans will ad@@ mit that the experience of commun@@ al ef@@ for@@ t in b@@ at@@ tle has been the high point of their lives .
"&quot; I &quot; pas@@ ses in@@ sen@@ si@@ bly into a &quot; we , &quot; &quot; my &quot; becom@@ es &quot; our &quot; and individ@@ ual fa@@ it@@ h l@@ os@@ es its cent@@ ral impor@@ tan@@ ce ."
I believe that it is nothing less than the as@@ sur@@ ance of im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality that makes self-@@ sa@@ cri@@ fic@@ e at these mo@@ ments so relati@@ vely easy .
"I may f@@ all , but I do not di@@ e , for that which is real in me goes for@@ ward and lives on in the com@@ rad@@ es for wh@@ om I gave up my life ."
It fe@@ els some@@ how up@@ lif@@ ting .
This idea that we move up was cent@@ ral in the writ@@ ing of the great F@@ r@@ en@@ ch soci@@ olog@@ ist E@@ mil@@ e D@@ ur@@ khe@@ im .
"D@@ ur@@ khe@@ im even called us H@@ omo du@@ pl@@ e@@ x , or tw@@ o-@@ level man ."
The lower level he called the level of the prof@@ ane .
Now prof@@ ane is the op@@ pos@@ ite of sa@@ cre@@ d .
It just means ordinary or common .
And in our ordinary lives we ex@@ ist as individ@@ u@@ als .
We want to sat@@ is@@ f@@ y our individ@@ ual des@@ ir@@ es .
We pur@@ su@@ e our individ@@ ual go@@ als .
But some@@ times something happens that tri@@ g@@ g@@ ers a ph@@ ase change .
"I@@ nd@@ ivid@@ u@@ als un@@ ite into a te@@ am , a movement or a na@@ tion , which is far more than the su@@ m of its parts ."
"D@@ ur@@ khe@@ im called this level the level of the sa@@ cre@@ d because he beli@@ ev@@ ed that the fun@@ c@@ tion of relig@@ ion was to un@@ ite people into a group , into a moral commun@@ ity ."
D@@ ur@@ khe@@ im beli@@ ev@@ ed that anything that un@@ it@@ es us takes on an air of sa@@ cre@@ d@@ ness .
"And once people cir@@ cle around some sa@@ cre@@ d ob@@ ject or val@@ ue , they &apos;ll then work as a te@@ am and fi@@ ght to de@@ f@@ end it ."
"D@@ ur@@ khe@@ im w@@ ro@@ te about a set of int@@ en@@ se col@@ lec@@ tive emo@@ tions that ac@@ compl@@ ish this mi@@ ra@@ cle of E pl@@ ur@@ ib@@ us un@@ um , of making a group out of individ@@ u@@ als ."
Th@@ ink of the col@@ lec@@ tive jo@@ y in Brit@@ ain on the day World War I@@ I end@@ ed .
"Th@@ ink of the col@@ lec@@ tive an@@ ger in T@@ a@@ h@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are , which b@@ rou@@ ght down a dic@@ t@@ at@@ or ."
So let me s@@ um@@ mar@@ ize where we are .
I &apos;m of@@ fer@@ ing the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or of a stair@@ case in the mind .
I &apos;m saying we are H@@ omo du@@ pl@@ e@@ x and this stair@@ case takes us up from the prof@@ ane level to the level of the sa@@ cre@@ d .
So here &apos;s the mil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ doll@@ ar question for social scient@@ ists like me : I@@ s the stair@@ case a fe@@ ature of our evolu@@ tion@@ ary des@@ ign ?
"I@@ s it a produc@@ t of natural sel@@ ec@@ tion , like our h@@ ands ?"
Well many scient@@ ists who study relig@@ ion take this view .
"The New A@@ the@@ ists , for example , arg@@ ue that relig@@ ion is a set of mem@@ es , sort of par@@ as@@ it@@ ic mem@@ es , that get inside our min@@ ds and make us do all kinds of cra@@ z@@ y religi@@ ous stuff , self-@@ des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tive stuff , like su@@ ic@@ ide bomb@@ ing ."
"And after all , how could it ever be good for us to l@@ ose ourselves ?"
How could it ever be adap@@ tive for any organ@@ ism to over@@ come self-@@ inter@@ est ?
Well let me show you .
"In &quot; &quot; The D@@ es@@ cent of M@@ an , &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in w@@ ro@@ te a great de@@ al about the evolution of moral@@ ity — where did it come from , why do we have it ."
"D@@ ar@@ w@@ in not@@ ed that many of our vir@@ tu@@ es are of very little use to ourselves , but they &apos;re of great use to our groups ."
But really the way to think about this is as mul@@ t@@ il@@ ev@@ el sel@@ ec@@ tion .
So look at it this way : You &apos;ve got comp@@ et@@ ition going on within groups and across groups .
So here &apos;s a group of gu@@ ys on a college cre@@ w te@@ am .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in this te@@ am there &apos;s comp@@ et@@ ition .
There are gu@@ ys comp@@ et@@ ing with each other .
"The s@@ lo@@ w@@ est ro@@ w@@ ers , the we@@ ak@@ est ro@@ w@@ ers , are going to get c@@ ut from the te@@ am ."
And only a few of these gu@@ ys are going to go on in the spor@@ t .
"So within the te@@ am , their interes@@ ts are actually p@@ it@@ ted against each other ."
And some@@ times it would be adv@@ ant@@ ag@@ e@@ ous for one of these gu@@ ys to try to sa@@ bot@@ age the other gu@@ ys .
M@@ aybe he &apos;ll b@@ ad@@ mo@@ uth his ch@@ i@@ ef r@@ iv@@ al to the co@@ ach .
"But while that comp@@ et@@ ition is going on within the bo@@ at , this comp@@ et@@ ition is going on across bo@@ at@@ s ."
They can only w@@ in if they all pul@@ l together as a te@@ am .
"I mean , these things sound tr@@ ite , but they are de@@ ep evolu@@ tion@@ ary tr@@ u@@ ths ."
Let me ill@@ u@@ stra@@ te this for you .
"S@@ up@@ pose we &apos;ve got a group of little organ@@ is@@ ms — they can be bac@@ ter@@ ia , they can be h@@ am@@ st@@ ers ; it doesn &apos;t matter what — and let &apos;s sup@@ pose that this little group here , they evol@@ ved to be co@@ oper@@ ative ."
"And as you &apos;ll see in this sim@@ ul@@ ation , as they inter@@ act they ga@@ in poin@@ ts , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed in si@@ ze , you &apos;ll see them s@@ pl@@ it , and that &apos;s how they re@@ produce and the population gro@@ ws ."
"We start with just one gre@@ en , and as it inter@@ ac@@ ts it ga@@ ins we@@ al@@ th or poin@@ ts or f@@ ood ."
"And in shor@@ t order , the co@@ oper@@ at@@ ors are done for ."
The fre@@ e-@@ r@@ id@@ ers have taken over .
I@@ f a group cannot sol@@ ve the fre@@ e-@@ r@@ ider problem then it cannot re@@ a@@ p the ben@@ ef@@ its of co@@ oper@@ ation and group sel@@ ec@@ tion cannot get started .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
"In fact , nature has sol@@ ved it many , many times ."
And nature &apos;s fav@@ or@@ ite sol@@ ution is to put everyone in the same bo@@ at .
"For example , why is it that the mit@@ o@@ ch@@ on@@ dr@@ ia in every cell has its own D@@ N@@ A , tot@@ ally se@@ par@@ ate from the D@@ N@@ A in the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us ?"
It &apos;s because they used to be se@@ par@@ ate fre@@ e-@@ liv@@ ing bac@@ ter@@ ia and they came together and bec@@ ame a super@@ organ@@ ism .
A super@@ organ@@ ism can basically take what it wan@@ ts .
And pretty so@@ on the whole population is actually com@@ posed of these new super@@ organ@@ is@@ ms .
What I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you here is some@@ times called a ma@@ j@@ or trans@@ ition in evolu@@ tion@@ ary history .
"D@@ ar@@ w@@ in &apos;s la@@ ws don &apos;t change , but now there &apos;s a new kind of play@@ er on the field and things be@@ g@@ in to look very different ."
"It happened again about 1@@ 20 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some sol@@ it@@ ary was@@ ps be@@ gan cre@@ ating little simple , pri@@ mit@@ ive n@@ es@@ ts , or h@@ iv@@ es ."
"And it happened again , even more spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ arly , in the last hal@@ f-@@ million years when our own an@@ c@@ est@@ ors bec@@ ame cul@@ t@@ ural cre@@ atures , they came together around a he@@ ar@@ th or a cam@@ p@@ fire , they d@@ ivid@@ ed lab@@ or , they be@@ gan pain@@ ting their bo@@ di@@ es , they sp@@ o@@ ke their own di@@ al@@ ec@@ ts , and ev@@ ent@@ ually they wor@@ shi@@ ped their own g@@ od@@ s ."
"O@@ n@@ ce they were all in the same tri@@ be , they could keep the ben@@ ef@@ its of co@@ oper@@ ation loc@@ ked inside ."
"And they un@@ loc@@ ked the most po@@ wer@@ ful force ever known on this planet , which is human co@@ oper@@ ation — a force for con@@ struc@@ tion and des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion ."
L@@ ook at the people in these ph@@ ot@@ os I &apos;ve been sho@@ wing you .
Do you think they &apos;re there pur@@ su@@ ing their self-@@ inter@@ est ?
"O@@ r are they pur@@ su@@ ing commun@@ al inter@@ est , which requ@@ ir@@ es them to l@@ ose themselves and become simply a part of a whole ?"
"O@@ kay , so that was my Tal@@ k del@@ iver@@ ed in the stan@@ dar@@ d TE@@ D way ."
And now I &apos;m going to give the whole Tal@@ k over again in three minutes in a more ful@@ l@@ -@@ spec@@ tr@@ um sort of way .
"( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) J@@ on@@ a@@ than H@@ a@@ id@@ t : We hum@@ ans have many vari@@ eties of religi@@ ous experience , as W@@ il@@ li@@ am J@@ am@@ es expl@@ ained ."
One of the most common is c@@ lim@@ b@@ ing the sec@@ ret stair@@ case and l@@ os@@ ing ourselves .
"The stair@@ case takes us from the experience of life as prof@@ ane or ordinary up@@ wards to the experience of life as sa@@ cre@@ d , or de@@ e@@ ply inter@@ connec@@ ted ."
"We are H@@ omo du@@ pl@@ e@@ x , as D@@ ur@@ khe@@ im expl@@ ained ."
"And we are H@@ omo du@@ pl@@ e@@ x because we evol@@ ved by mul@@ t@@ il@@ ev@@ el sel@@ ec@@ tion , as D@@ ar@@ w@@ in expl@@ ained ."
"If it is an adap@@ t@@ ation , then we evol@@ ved to be religi@@ ous ."
"I mean that we evol@@ ved to see sa@@ cre@@ d@@ ness all around us and to jo@@ in with others into te@@ ams and cir@@ cle around sa@@ cre@@ d ob@@ jects , people and ideas ."
This is why polit@@ ics is so trib@@ al .
"@@ P@@ ol@@ it@@ ics is par@@ tly prof@@ ane , it &apos;s par@@ tly about self-@@ inter@@ est , but polit@@ ics is also about sa@@ cre@@ d@@ ness ."
It &apos;s about jo@@ in@@ ing with others to pur@@ su@@ e moral ideas .
"It &apos;s about the et@@ er@@ n@@ al str@@ ug@@ g@@ le between good and ev@@ il , and we all believe we &apos;re on the good te@@ am ."
"And most impor@@ tan@@ tly , if the stair@@ case is real , it expl@@ ains the per@@ s@@ ist@@ ent under@@ cur@@ r@@ ent of dis@@ sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion in modern life ."
"Because human be@@ ings are , to some ext@@ ent , h@@ iv@@ ish cre@@ atures like be@@ es ."
We &apos;re be@@ es . We bu@@ st@@ ed out of the h@@ ive d@@ uring the En@@ li@@ gh@@ t@@ en@@ ment .
We bro@@ ke down the old inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions and b@@ rou@@ ght li@@ b@@ erty to the op@@ pres@@ sed .
N@@ ow@@ ada@@ ys we f@@ ly around like individ@@ ual be@@ es ex@@ ul@@ ting in our fre@@ ed@@ om .
But some@@ times we won@@ der : I@@ s this all there is ?
What should I do with my life ?
What &apos;s mis@@ sing ?
"What &apos;s mis@@ sing is that we are H@@ omo du@@ pl@@ e@@ x , but modern , sec@@ ul@@ ar society was built to sat@@ is@@ f@@ y our lower , prof@@ ane selves ."
It &apos;s really com@@ for@@ table down here on the lower level .
"C@@ ome , have a se@@ at in my home ent@@ ert@@ ain@@ ment center ."
One great challenge of modern life is to find the stair@@ case ami@@ d all the cl@@ ut@@ ter and then to do something good and nob@@ le once you c@@ lim@@ b to the top .
I see this des@@ ire in my students at the Un@@ iver@@ s@@ ity of V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
They all want to find a cause or call@@ ing that they can th@@ row themselves into .
They &apos;re all se@@ arch@@ ing for their stair@@ case .
M@@ ost people long to over@@ come p@@ et@@ t@@ iness and become part of something larg@@ er .
And this expl@@ ains the ex@@ tra@@ ordinary res@@ on@@ ance of this simple met@@ ap@@ h@@ or con@@ j@@ ured up ne@@ arly 4@@ 00 years ago .
&quot; &quot; No man is an is@@ l@@ and enti@@ re of itself .
"E@@ very man is a piece of the contin@@ ent , a part of the ma@@ in . &quot; &quot; J@@ H : Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk today about the pleas@@ ures of every@@ day life .
But I want to be@@ g@@ in with a story of an un@@ us@@ ual and ter@@ ri@@ ble man .
This is H@@ er@@ man@@ n Go@@ er@@ ing .
"@@ Go@@ er@@ ing was H@@ it@@ l@@ er &apos;s second in com@@ m@@ and in World War I@@ I , his des@@ ign@@ ated success@@ or ."
"And like H@@ it@@ l@@ er , Go@@ er@@ ing f@@ an@@ ci@@ ed h@@ im@@ self a col@@ lec@@ tor of art ."
"H@@ it@@ l@@ er had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any ."
And it was his fav@@ or@@ ite art@@ work ever .
"@@ World War I@@ I came to an end , and Go@@ er@@ ing was cap@@ tu@@ red , tried at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely s@@ ent@@ enc@@ ed to de@@ ath ."
Th@@ en the Al@@ li@@ ed for@@ ces went through his col@@ lec@@ tions and found the pain@@ t@@ ings and went after the people who s@@ old it to him .
"@@ V@@ an M@@ e@@ e@@ ger@@ en was ch@@ arg@@ ed with the cri@@ me of tre@@ as@@ on , which is itself p@@ un@@ ish@@ able by de@@ ath ."
"S@@ i@@ x weeks into his pris@@ on s@@ ent@@ ence , v@@ an M@@ e@@ e@@ ger@@ en con@@ f@@ ess@@ ed ."
But he didn &apos;t con@@ f@@ ess to tre@@ as@@ on .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I did not s@@ ell a great ma@@ st@@ er@@ piece to that N@@ az@@ i ."
I pain@@ ted it myself ; I &apos;m a for@@ ger . &quot; &quot; Now nob@@ ody beli@@ ev@@ ed him .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll pro@@ ve it ."
"B@@ r@@ ing me a can@@ v@@ as and some pain@@ t , and I will pain@@ t a V@@ er@@ me@@ er much better than I s@@ old that dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing N@@ az@@ i ."
He pain@@ ted a beautiful V@@ er@@ me@@ er .
And then the ch@@ arg@@ es of tre@@ as@@ on were dro@@ pped .
"He had a l@@ ess@@ er ch@@ arg@@ e of for@@ g@@ ery , got a year s@@ ent@@ ence and di@@ ed a h@@ ero to the D@@ ut@@ ch people ."
"There &apos;s a lot more to be said about v@@ an M@@ e@@ e@@ ger@@ en , but I want to turn now to Go@@ er@@ ing , who &apos;s pic@@ tu@@ red here being inter@@ ro@@ ga@@ ted at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g ."
"Now Go@@ er@@ ing was , by all ac@@ coun@@ ts , a ter@@ ri@@ ble man ."
H@@ is American inter@@ ro@@ ga@@ tors describ@@ ed him as an am@@ ic@@ able psych@@ op@@ ath .
He had disc@@ over@@ ed after all that the pain@@ ting he thought was this was actually that .
It wasn &apos;t just him who was in for a sh@@ ock .
"In particular , &quot; &quot; The S@@ up@@ per at E@@ m@@ ma@@ us &quot; &quot; which was vie@@ wed as V@@ er@@ me@@ er &apos;s fin@@ est ma@@ st@@ er@@ piece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a for@@ g@@ ery ."
"It was not that pain@@ ting , but that pain@@ ting ."
"And when that was disc@@ over@@ ed , it lost all its val@@ ue and was taken away from the mus@@ e@@ um ."
Why does this matter ?
I &apos;m a psych@@ olog@@ ists — why do or@@ ig@@ ins matter so much ?
Why do we respon@@ d so much to our kno@@ w@@ l@@ edge of where something comes from ?
Well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
"M@@ any soci@@ olog@@ ists like V@@ ebl@@ en and W@@ ol@@ fe would arg@@ ue that the reason why we take or@@ ig@@ ins so seri@@ ously is because we &apos;re s@@ n@@ obs , because we &apos;re f@@ oc@@ used on stat@@ us ."
"A@@ mon@@ g other things , if you want to show off how rich you are , how po@@ wer@@ ful you are , it &apos;s always better to own an or@@ ig@@ in@@ al than a for@@ g@@ ery because there &apos;s always going to be fe@@ wer or@@ ig@@ in@@ als than for@@ ger@@ ies ."
"@@ that hum@@ ans are , to some ext@@ ent , natural born essenti@@ al@@ ists ."
"What I mean by this is we don &apos;t just respon@@ d to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ ther , our respon@@ se is con@@ diti@@ on@@ ed on our beli@@ ef@@ s , about what they really are , what they came from , what they &apos;re made of , what their h@@ id@@ den nature is ."
"I want to su@@ g@@ gest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we re@@ act to things ."
"So I want to su@@ g@@ gest that pleas@@ ure is de@@ ep — and that this isn &apos;t true just for high@@ er level pleas@@ ures like art , but even the most se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly simple pleas@@ ures are af@@ fec@@ ted by our beli@@ ef@@ s about h@@ id@@ den es@@ sen@@ ces ."
So take f@@ ood .
W@@ ould you e@@ at this ?
"Well , a good answer is , &quot; &quot; It dep@@ ends . What is it ? &quot; &quot; S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s por@@ k , but not be@@ ef ."
F@@ ew of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s a r@@ at or a human .
S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it only if it &apos;s a str@@ ang@@ ely col@@ or@@ ed piece of to@@ f@@ u .
That &apos;s not so sur@@ pris@@ ing .
But what &apos;s more interesting is how it t@@ ast@@ es to you will dep@@ end c@@ rit@@ ically on what you think you &apos;re e@@ ating .
So one demon@@ stra@@ tion of this was done with young children .
"@@ How do you make children not just be more lik@@ ely to e@@ at car@@ ro@@ ts and dr@@ ink mil@@ k , but to get more pleas@@ ure from e@@ ating car@@ ro@@ ts and dr@@ in@@ king mil@@ k — to think they t@@ as@@ te better ?"
How do you get ad@@ ults to really en@@ jo@@ y w@@ ine ?
This was rec@@ ently done with a neuro@@ sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic tw@@ ist .
In fron@@ t of them on a scre@@ en is information about the w@@ ine .
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body , of course , dr@@ in@@ ks exactly the same w@@ ine ."
"But if you believe you &apos;re dr@@ in@@ king exp@@ en@@ sive stuff , parts of the brain as@@ soci@@ ated with pleas@@ ure and re@@ ward light up like a Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ mas tree ."
"It &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more pleas@@ ura@@ ble , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way ."
O@@ r take sex .
These are s@@ tim@@ uli I &apos;ve used in some of my studies .
"And if you simply show people these pic@@ tures , they &apos;ll say these are fa@@ ir@@ ly at@@ trac@@ tive people ."
"You probably think the picture on the left is mal@@ e , the one on the right is f@@ em@@ ale ."
"If that beli@@ ef turns out to be mis@@ taken , it will make a difference ."
"It will make a difference if you were to disc@@ over that the person you &apos;re looking at with l@@ ust is actually a dis@@ gu@@ ised ver@@ sion of your son or daughter , your mother or father ."
"If you like somebody , they look better to you ."
This is why sp@@ ous@@ es in happy marri@@ ages t@@ end to think that their h@@ us@@ b@@ and or wife looks much better than any@@ one else thin@@ ks that they do .
( Laughter ) A particul@@ arly dra@@ ma@@ tic example of this comes from a neuro@@ log@@ ical dis@@ order known as C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
So C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me is a dis@@ order where you get a spec@@ if@@ ic del@@ us@@ ion .
"Now of@@ ten , a res@@ ult of C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me is tra@@ g@@ ic ."
But there &apos;s at le@@ ast one case where C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me had a happy end@@ ing .
This was rec@@ ord@@ ed in 19@@ 3@@ 1 .
The golf cl@@ ub@@ s were ow@@ ned by Jo@@ h@@ n F@@ . K@@ en@@ n@@ ed@@ y and s@@ old for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ art@@ ers of a million dollars at auc@@ tion .
The bub@@ ble gu@@ m was che@@ wed up by po@@ p star Brit@@ ney S@@ pe@@ ars and s@@ old for s@@ ever@@ al hund@@ re@@ ds of dollars .
"And in fact , there &apos;s a th@@ r@@ iv@@ ing mark@@ et in the parti@@ ally e@@ at@@ en f@@ ood of b@@ el@@ ov@@ ed people ."
( Laughter ) The sho@@ es are perhaps the most val@@ u@@ able of all .
"A@@ c@@ c@@ ord@@ ing to an un@@ con@@ fir@@ m@@ ed re@@ port , a S@@ au@@ di mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e of@@ fer@@ ed 10 million dollars for this pa@@ ir of sho@@ es ."
They were the ones th@@ ro@@ wn at G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ ush at an I@@ ra@@ q@@ i pres@@ s con@@ fer@@ ence s@@ ever@@ al years ago .
"W@@ it@@ h my colle@@ ag@@ ues G@@ e@@ or@@ ge Ne@@ w@@ man and G@@ il D@@ i@@ es@@ en@@ dr@@ uc@@ k , we &apos;ve looked to see what sort of fac@@ tors , what sort of history , mat@@ ters for the ob@@ jects that people like ."
"So in one of our experim@@ ents , we asked people to na@@ me a famo@@ us person who they ad@@ or@@ ed , a liv@@ ing person they ad@@ or@@ ed ."
So one answer was G@@ e@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey .
"Th@@ en we asked them , &quot; How much would you pa@@ y for G@@ e@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey &apos;s swe@@ ater ? &quot;"
And the answer is a fa@@ ir amount — more than you would pa@@ y for a brand new swe@@ ater or a swe@@ ater ow@@ ned by somebody who you didn &apos;t ad@@ ore .
Th@@ en we asked other groups of sub@@ jects — we gave them different re@@ str@@ ic@@ tions and different con@@ diti@@ ons .
"So for inst@@ ance , we told some people , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , you can buy the swe@@ ater , but you can &apos;t tell any@@ body you own it , and you can &apos;t res@@ ell it . &quot; &quot; That dro@@ ps the val@@ ue of it , su@@ g@@ g@@ es@@ ting that that &apos;s one reason why we like it ."
"But what really c@@ a@@ us@@ es an ef@@ fect is you tell people , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , you could res@@ ell it , you could bo@@ ast about it , but before it gets to you , it &apos;s th@@ o@@ rou@@ gh@@ ly wa@@ shed . &quot; &quot; That c@@ a@@ us@@ es a hu@@ ge drop in the val@@ ue ."
"As my wife put it , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve wa@@ shed away the C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey co@@ ot@@ ies . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s go back to art ."
"But I don &apos;t want a du@@ plic@@ ate , even if I can &apos;t tell the difference ."
"That &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , I &apos;m a s@@ nob and want to bo@@ ast about having an or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ."
Wh@@ o here lik@@ es the work of J@@ ac@@ k@@ son P@@ ol@@ loc@@ k ?
"O@@ kay . Wh@@ o here , it does nothing for them ?"
They just don &apos;t like it .
And they then re@@ por@@ ted that her father was co@@ ach@@ ing her .
"When this came out on t@@ el@@ ev@@ is@@ ion , the val@@ ue of her art dro@@ pped to nothing ."
"It was the same art , physic@@ ally , but the history had changed ."
So he got Jo@@ shu@@ a B@@ ell to take his million doll@@ ar viol@@ in down to a W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ . sub@@ way st@@ ation and st@@ and in the cor@@ ner and see how much money he would make .
And here &apos;s a bri@@ ef cli@@ p of this .
"( V@@ i@@ ol@@ in music ) A@@ f@@ ter being there for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ art@@ ers of an h@@ our , he made 3@@ 2 dollars ."
Not bad . It &apos;s also not good .
"@@ Ap@@ par@@ ently to really en@@ jo@@ y the music of Jo@@ shu@@ a B@@ ell , you have to know you &apos;re l@@ ist@@ ening to Jo@@ shu@@ a B@@ ell ."
Because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the video — she comes up .
So she &apos;s st@@ un@@ ned that he &apos;s st@@ anding in a sub@@ way st@@ ation .
So she &apos;s struc@@ k with p@@ ity .
She re@@ ach@@ es into her pur@@ se and h@@ ands him a 20 .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The second example from music is from Jo@@ h@@ n C@@ age &apos;s moder@@ n@@ ist com@@ position , &quot; 4 &apos; 3@@ 3 &quot; . &quot;"
And people have different vie@@ ws on this .
But what I want to point out is you can buy this from iT@@ un@@ es .
"( Laughter ) F@@ or a doll@@ ar 9@@ 9 , you can l@@ ist@@ en to that sil@@ ence , which is different than other for@@ ms of sil@@ ence . ( Laughter )"
"Now I &apos;ve been talking so far about pleas@@ ure , but what I want to su@@ g@@ gest is that everything I &apos;ve said app@@ lies as well to pain ."
"And how you think about what you &apos;re experiencing , your beli@@ ef@@ s about the ess@@ ence of it , af@@ fect how it h@@ ur@@ ts ."
One lov@@ ely experiment was done by K@@ ur@@ t G@@ ra@@ y and D@@ an W@@ e@@ gn@@ er .
And they gave them a ser@@ ies of pain@@ ful elec@@ tri@@ c sh@@ oc@@ ks .
So it was a ser@@ ies of five pain@@ ful sh@@ oc@@ ks .
"The second sh@@ ock fe@@ els less pain@@ ful , because you get a bit used to it ."
"The th@@ ir@@ d dro@@ ps , the f@@ our@@ th , the fi@@ f@@ th ."
The pain gets less .
"In the other con@@ d@@ ition , they &apos;re told that the person in the next room is sh@@ oc@@ king them on pur@@ pose — kno@@ ws they &apos;re sh@@ oc@@ king them ."
The first sh@@ ock h@@ ur@@ ts like h@@ ell .
"The second sh@@ ock h@@ ur@@ ts just as much , and the th@@ ir@@ d and the f@@ our@@ th and the fi@@ f@@ th ."
"The most extre@@ me example of this is that in some c@@ as@@ es , pain under the right cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces can trans@@ form into pleas@@ ure ."
"The point was n@@ ic@@ ely s@@ um@@ mar@@ iz@@ ed by the po@@ et Jo@@ h@@ n M@@ il@@ ton who w@@ ro@@ te , &quot; &quot; The mind is its own place , and in itself can make a he@@ aven of h@@ ell , a h@@ ell of he@@ aven . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ll end with that . Thank you ."
( Applause )
And finally I end@@ ed up en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing psych@@ ology by chan@@ ce .
"I was at a s@@ ki res@@ or@@ t in S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ l@@ and without any money to actually en@@ jo@@ y myself , because the s@@ now had mel@@ ted and I didn &apos;t have money to go to a mo@@ vi@@ e . But I found that on the — I read in the new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers that there was to be a pres@@ ent@@ ation by someone in a place that I &apos;d seen in the center of Z@@ ur@@ ich , and it was about fl@@ ying sa@@ uc@@ ers &#91; that &#93; he was going to talk ."
And the man who tal@@ ked at that ev@@ ening lec@@ ture was very interesting .
And this se@@ em@@ ed very interesting to me .
And I started read@@ ing his bo@@ o@@ ks after that lec@@ ture .
"And that was C@@ ar@@ l J@@ un@@ g , wh@@ ose na@@ me or work I had no idea about ."
Th@@ en I came to this country to study psych@@ ology and I started trying to understand the ro@@ ots of happiness .
"This is a typ@@ ical res@@ ult that many people have pres@@ ent@@ ed , and there are many vari@@ ations on it ."
"But this , for inst@@ ance , sho@@ ws that about 30 percent of the people surv@@ ey@@ ed in the United States since 19@@ 5@@ 6 say that their life is very happy ."
And that h@@ as@@ n &apos;t changed at all .
"Wh@@ ere@@ as the per@@ s@@ onal income , on a sc@@ ale that has been hel@@ d con@@ st@@ ant to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ da@@ te for in@@ fl@@ ation , has more than d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed , almost tri@@ pl@@ ed , in that peri@@ od ."
"But you find essenti@@ ally the same results , nam@@ ely , that after a certain bas@@ ic point — which cor@@ respon@@ ds more or less to just a few 1@@ ,000 dollars ab@@ ove the min@@ im@@ um pov@@ erty level — increas@@ es in material well-being don &apos;t seem to af@@ fect how happy people are ."
"In fact , you can find that the l@@ ack of bas@@ ic resour@@ ces , material resour@@ ces , con@@ trib@@ utes to un@@ happiness , but the increase in material resour@@ ces does not increase happiness ."
"So my research has been f@@ oc@@ used more on — after fin@@ ding out these things that actually cor@@ respon@@ ded to my own experience , I tried to understand : where — in every@@ day life , in our nor@@ mal experience — do we feel really happy ?"
"And to start those studies about 40 years ago , I be@@ gan to look at cre@@ ative people — first art@@ ists and scient@@ ists , and so for@@ th — trying to understand what made them feel that it was wor@@ th essenti@@ ally sp@@ end@@ ing their life doing things for which many of them didn &apos;t exp@@ ect e@@ i@@ ther f@@ ame or for@@ tun@@ e , but which made their life me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful and wor@@ th doing ."
This was one of the lead@@ ing com@@ pos@@ ers of American music back in the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
And the inter@@ view was 40 p@@ ages long .
But this little exc@@ er@@ p@@ t is a very good s@@ um@@ mar@@ y of what he was saying d@@ uring the inter@@ view .
And it describ@@ es how he fe@@ els when com@@ pos@@ ing is going well .
And he says by describ@@ ing it as an ec@@ st@@ ati@@ c state .
"Now , &quot; &quot; ec@@ st@@ as@@ y &quot; &quot; in G@@ re@@ e@@ k me@@ ant simply to st@@ and to the side of something ."
And then it bec@@ ame essenti@@ ally an anal@@ og@@ y for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary every@@ day ro@@ ut@@ ines .
So ec@@ st@@ as@@ y is essenti@@ ally a ste@@ p@@ ping into an al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive reality .
"And it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civiliz@@ ations that we look up to as having been p@@ in@@ nac@@ les of human achi@@ ev@@ ement — whether it &apos;s China , G@@ re@@ ec@@ e , the H@@ ind@@ u civiliz@@ ation , or the M@@ ay@@ as , or E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ ans — what we know about them is really about their ec@@ st@@ as@@ ies , not about their every@@ day life ."
"We know the tem@@ pl@@ es they built , where people could come to experience a different reality ."
"We know about the cir@@ c@@ us@@ es , the ar@@ en@@ as , the the@@ at@@ ers ."
"Th@@ ese are the re@@ main@@ s of civiliz@@ ations and they are the plac@@ es that people went to experience life in a more con@@ cent@@ ra@@ ted , more ord@@ er@@ ed form ."
"Now , this man doesn &apos;t need to go to a place like this , which is also — this place , this ar@@ ena , which is built like a G@@ re@@ e@@ k am@@ ph@@ i@@ the@@ at@@ re , is a place for ec@@ st@@ as@@ y also ."
We are parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating in a reality that is different from that of the every@@ day life that we &apos;re used to .
But this man doesn &apos;t need to go there .
"He need@@ s just a piece of p@@ ap@@ er where he can put down little mar@@ ks , and as he does that , he can imagine s@@ oun@@ ds that had not ex@@ is@@ ted before in that particular com@@ b@@ in@@ ation ."
"So once he gets to that point of beginning to create , like J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer did in her impro@@ vi@@ sa@@ tion , a new reality — that is , a moment of ec@@ st@@ as@@ y — he ent@@ ers that different reality ."
Now he says also that this is so int@@ en@@ se an experience that it fe@@ els almost as if he didn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
And that s@@ oun@@ ds like a kind of a rom@@ an@@ tic ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation .
"But actually , our nerv@@ ous system is in@@ cap@@ able of proc@@ ess@@ ing more than about 1@@ 10 b@@ its of information per second ."
"And in order to hear me and understand what I &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 b@@ its per second ."
That &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear more than two people .
You can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
"Well , when you are really inv@@ ol@@ ved in this complet@@ ely en@@ gag@@ ing process of cre@@ ating something new , as this man is , he doesn &apos;t have enough att@@ en@@ tion left over to mon@@ it@@ or how his body fe@@ els , or his problems at home ."
He can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s h@@ un@@ gr@@ y or ti@@ red .
"H@@ is body di@@ sa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars , his id@@ ent@@ ity di@@ sa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars from his con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , because he doesn &apos;t have enough att@@ en@@ tion , like n@@ one of us do , to really do well something that requ@@ ir@@ es a lot of con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion , and at the same time to feel that he ex@@ ists ."
So ex@@ ist@@ ence is tem@@ por@@ ar@@ ily sus@@ p@@ end@@ ed .
And he says that his hand seems to be mov@@ ing by itself .
"Now , I could look at my hand for two weeks , and I wouldn &apos;t feel any a@@ we or won@@ der , because I can &apos;t comp@@ ose . ( Laughter ) So what it &apos;s telling you here is that ob@@ vi@@ ously this a@@ ut@@ o@@ ma@@ tic , spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous process that he &apos;s describ@@ ing can only happen to someone who is very well tra@@ ined and who has developed te@@ ch@@ ni@@ qu@@ e ."
And it has become a kind of a tr@@ u@@ ism in the study of cre@@ ati@@ vity that you can &apos;t be cre@@ ating anything with less than 10 years of techn@@ ic@@ al-@@ kno@@ w@@ l@@ edge im@@ mer@@ sion in a particular field .
"Wh@@ ether it &apos;s ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics or music , it takes that long to be able to be@@ g@@ in to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before ."
"Now , when that happens , he says the music just flo@@ ws out ."
And because all of these people I started inter@@ vie@@ wing — this was an inter@@ view which is over 30 years old — so many of the people describ@@ ed this as a spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous flow that I called this typ@@ e of experience the &quot; &quot; flow experience . &quot; &quot; And it happens in different real@@ ms .
"For inst@@ ance , a po@@ et describ@@ es it in this form ."
This is by a stud@@ ent of min@@ e who inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the lead@@ ing writ@@ ers and po@@ ets in the United States .
"And it describ@@ es the same ef@@ for@@ t@@ less , spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous feel@@ ing that you get when you en@@ ter into this ec@@ st@@ ati@@ c state ."
"This po@@ et describ@@ es it as op@@ ening a do@@ or that flo@@ at@@ s in the sk@@ y — a very si@@ mil@@ ar descri@@ p@@ tion to what Al@@ b@@ ert E@@ instein gave as to how he imag@@ ined the for@@ ces of relati@@ vity , when he was str@@ ug@@ gl@@ ing with trying to understand how it worked ."
But it happens in other acti@@ v@@ ities .
"For inst@@ ance , this is another stud@@ ent of min@@ e , Su@@ sa@@ n J@@ ac@@ k@@ son from A@@ ust@@ ral@@ ia , who did work with some of the lead@@ ing a@@ th@@ l@@ et@@ es in the world ."
"And you see here in this descri@@ p@@ tion of an O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ ic sk@@ ater , the same essenti@@ al descri@@ p@@ tion of the ph@@ enom@@ en@@ ology of the in@@ ner state of the person ."
"You don &apos;t think ; it goes a@@ ut@@ o@@ ma@@ tically , if you mer@@ ge yourself with the music , and so for@@ th ."
"It happens also , actually , in the most rec@@ ent bo@@ ok I w@@ ro@@ te , called &quot; &quot; G@@ ood B@@ usiness , &quot; &quot; where I inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had been n@@ om@@ in@@ ated by their pe@@ ers as being both very successful and very e@@ th@@ ical , very soci@@ ally responsi@@ ble ."
You see that these people defin@@ e success as something that hel@@ ps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .
"And like all of these successful and responsi@@ ble C@@ E@@ O@@ s say , you can &apos;t have just one of these things be successful if you want a me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful and successful job ."
A@@ n@@ it@@ a R@@ od@@ dic@@ k is another one of these C@@ E@@ O@@ s we inter@@ vie@@ wed .
"She is the f@@ ou@@ nd@@ er of B@@ ody S@@ h@@ op , the natural c@@ os@@ me@@ tics king ."
It &apos;s kind of a pas@@ sion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you &apos;re working .
"This is an interesting little quot@@ e from M@@ as@@ ar@@ u I@@ b@@ uk@@ a , who was at that time star@@ ting out S@@ on@@ y without any money , without a produc@@ t — they didn &apos;t have a produc@@ t , they didn &apos;t have anything , but they had an idea ."
"And the idea he had was to est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish a place of work where engine@@ ers can feel the jo@@ y of techn@@ ological in@@ nov@@ ation , be a@@ w@@ are of their mis@@ sion to society and work to their heart &apos;s cont@@ ent ."
I c@@ ouldn &apos;t impro@@ ve on this as a good example of how flow ent@@ ers the work@@ place .
"Now , when we do studies — we have , with other colle@@ ag@@ ues around the world , done over 8@@ ,000 inter@@ vie@@ ws of people — from D@@ om@@ in@@ ic@@ an mon@@ ks , to bl@@ ind n@@ un@@ s , to H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ an c@@ lim@@ b@@ ers , to N@@ av@@ a@@ j@@ o she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds — who en@@ jo@@ y their work ."
"And re@@ gar@@ dl@@ ess of the culture , re@@ gar@@ dl@@ ess of education or wh@@ at@@ ever , there are these seven con@@ diti@@ ons that seem to be there when a person is in flow ."
"You know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time di@@ sa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars , you for@@ get yourself , you feel part of something larg@@ er ."
"And once the con@@ diti@@ ons are pres@@ ent , what you are doing becom@@ es wor@@ th doing for its own sa@@ ke ."
"In our studies , we re@@ pres@@ ent the every@@ day life of people in this simple s@@ che@@ me ."
"And we can measure this very prec@@ is@@ ely , actually , because we give people elec@@ t@@ ron@@ ic p@@ ag@@ ers that go off 10 times a day , and wh@@ en@@ ever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about ."
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of sk@@ ill that they feel they have at that moment .
"So for each person we can est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish an average , which is the center of the diag@@ ram ."
"That would be your mean level of challenge and sk@@ ill , which will be different from that of any@@ body else ."
"But you have a kind of a set point there , which would be in the middle ."
"If we know what that set point is , we can predic@@ t fa@@ ir@@ ly acc@@ ura@@ t@@ ely when you will be in flow , and it will be when your challen@@ g@@ es are high@@ er than average and sk@@ il@@ ls are high@@ er than average ."
And then the other are@@ as become less and less positive .
A@@ rou@@ sa@@ l is still good because you are over@@ -@@ challen@@ g@@ ed there .
"C@@ on@@ tro@@ l is also a good place to be , because there you feel com@@ for@@ table , but not very exc@@ ited ."
It &apos;s not very challen@@ ging any more .
"And if you want to en@@ ter flow from contro@@ l , you have to increase the challen@@ g@@ es ."
So those two are ide@@ al and compl@@ em@@ ent@@ ary are@@ as from which flow is easy to go into .
The other com@@ b@@ in@@ ations of challenge and sk@@ ill become progres@@ si@@ vely less op@@ ti@@ mal .
"B@@ or@@ ed@@ om begin@@ s to be very aver@@ sive and ap@@ a@@ thy becom@@ es very nega@@ tive : you don &apos;t feel that you &apos;re doing anything , you don &apos;t use your sk@@ il@@ ls , there &apos;s no challenge ."
"The larg@@ est single con@@ trib@@ ut@@ or to that experience is wat@@ ch@@ ing t@@ el@@ ev@@ is@@ ion ; the next one is being in the b@@ a@@ th@@ room , sit@@ ting ."
"E@@ v@@ en though some@@ times wat@@ ch@@ ing t@@ el@@ ev@@ is@@ ion about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that &apos;s when you cho@@ ose a prog@@ ram you really want to watch and you get fe@@ ed@@ back from it ."
So the question we are trying to ad@@ d@@ ress — and I &apos;m way over time — is how to put more and more of every@@ day life in that flow chan@@ ne@@ l .
And that is the kind of challenge that we &apos;re trying to understand .
"And some of you ob@@ vi@@ ously know how to do that spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously without any ad@@ vic@@ e , but un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately a lot of people don &apos;t ."
"And that &apos;s what our man@@ da@@ te is , in a way , to do ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I have an inter@@ est in education .
S@@ h@@ ak@@ es@@ pe@@ are being seven ?
"I &apos;ve got two kids ; he &apos;s 2@@ 1 now , my daughter &apos;s 1@@ 6 ."
He didn &apos;t want to come to L@@ os A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ es .
"They &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life ."
The brain isn &apos;t d@@ ivid@@ ed into com@@ par@@ t@@ ments .
"Because you are , ar@@ en &apos;t you ?"
"If I &apos;m co@@ o@@ king , the do@@ or is sh@@ ut , the kids are out , the ph@@ one &apos;s on the h@@ ook , if she comes in I get an@@ no@@ y@@ ed ."
"T@@ ake her to a dan@@ ce school . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What happened ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; She did . I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was ."
We wal@@ ked in this room and it was ful@@ l of people like me .
People who had to move to think . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o had to move to think .
"We are built out of very small stuff , and we are em@@ bed@@ ded in a very large c@@ osmo@@ s , and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality at e@@ i@@ ther of those sc@@ al@@ es , and that &apos;s because our bra@@ ins hav@@ en &apos;t evol@@ ved to understand the world at that sc@@ ale ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , we &apos;re tra@@ pped on this very th@@ in sl@@ ice of per@@ cep@@ tion right in the middle ."
So take the col@@ ors of our world .
But we &apos;re not see@@ ing all the w@@ av@@ es out there .
"In fact , what we see is less than a 10 tr@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ th of what &apos;s out there ."
"Now , it &apos;s not that these things are in@@ her@@ ently un@@ see@@ able ."
"S@@ nak@@ es in@@ cl@@ u@@ de some in@@ fr@@ ar@@ ed in their reality , and hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es in@@ cl@@ u@@ de ul@@ tr@@ av@@ i@@ ol@@ et in their view of the world , and of course we build ma@@ chin@@ es in the da@@ sh@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds of our c@@ ars to pic@@ k up on signals in the radi@@ o fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy ran@@ ge , and we built ma@@ chin@@ es in h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als to pic@@ k up on the X@@ -@@ ra@@ y ran@@ ge ."
"But you can &apos;t sense any of those by yourself , at le@@ ast not yet , because you don &apos;t come equ@@ ip@@ ped with the pro@@ per sen@@ s@@ ors ."
"Now , what this means is that our experience of reality is con@@ stra@@ ined by our bi@@ ology , and that goes against the common sense not@@ ion that our ey@@ es and our e@@ ars and our f@@ ing@@ erti@@ ps are just pic@@ king up the ob@@ jec@@ tive reality that &apos;s out there ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , our bra@@ ins are sam@@ pl@@ ing just a little bit of the world ."
"So in the bl@@ ind and de@@ a@@ f world of the tic@@ k , the important signals are tem@@ per@@ ature and b@@ ut@@ y@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id ; in the world of the black gh@@ ost k@@ ni@@ fe@@ f@@ ish , its sen@@ s@@ ory world is l@@ av@@ ish@@ ly col@@ or@@ ed by elec@@ tr@@ ical fiel@@ ds ; and for the e@@ ch@@ ol@@ oc@@ ating b@@ at , its reality is con@@ struc@@ ted out of air com@@ pres@@ sion w@@ av@@ es ."
"That &apos;s the sl@@ ice of their ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem that they can pic@@ k up on , and we have a word for this in science ."
"Now , pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly , every an@@ ima@@ l as@@ s@@ um@@ es that its um@@ w@@ el@@ t is the enti@@ re ob@@ jec@@ tive reality out there , because why would you ever stop to imagine that there &apos;s something be@@ y@@ ond what we can sense ."
Let &apos;s do a con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ er on this .
I@@ mag@@ ine that you are a blo@@ od@@ h@@ ound do@@ g .
Y@@ our whole world is about sm@@ elling .
"You &apos;ve got a long s@@ n@@ out that has 200 million sc@@ ent re@@ cep@@ tors in it , and you have w@@ et nos@@ tr@@ ils that at@@ trac@@ t and tra@@ p sc@@ ent molecul@@ es , and your nos@@ tr@@ ils even have s@@ lit@@ s so you can take big nos@@ ef@@ uls of air ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing is about sm@@ ell for you .
"So one day , you stop in your trac@@ ks with a re@@ vel@@ ation ."
"You look at your human ow@@ ner and you think , &quot; &quot; What is it like to have the p@@ iti@@ ful , im@@ p@@ over@@ i@@ shed n@@ ose of a human ?"
( Laughter ) What is it like when you take a fe@@ eb@@ le little nos@@ e@@ ful of air ?
"@@ How can you not know that there &apos;s a c@@ at 100 yar@@ ds away , or that your ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or was on this very sp@@ ot six h@@ ours ago ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So because we &apos;re hum@@ ans , we &apos;ve never experienc@@ ed that world of sm@@ ell , so we don &apos;t mis@@ s it , because we are fir@@ m@@ ly s@@ et@@ t@@ led into our um@@ w@@ el@@ t ."
"But the question is , do we have to be st@@ uc@@ k there ?"
"So as a neuro@@ scient@@ ist , I &apos;m interes@@ ted in the way that technology might exp@@ and our um@@ w@@ el@@ t , and how that &apos;s going to change the experience of being human ."
"So the way this works is , you take a mic@@ ro@@ ph@@ one and you di@@ g@@ iti@@ ze the sign@@ al , and you put an elec@@ tro@@ de st@@ ri@@ p direc@@ tly into the in@@ ner e@@ ar ."
"Wh@@ y ? It &apos;s because these techn@@ olog@@ ies speak the language of S@@ il@@ ic@@ on V@@ al@@ ley , and it &apos;s not exactly the same di@@ al@@ ect as our natural bi@@ ological sense organ@@ s ."
But the fact is that it works ; the brain fig@@ ures out how to use the signals just fin@@ e .
"Now , how do we understand that ?"
"Well , here &apos;s the big sec@@ ret : Y@@ our brain is not he@@ ar@@ ing or see@@ ing any of this ."
Y@@ our brain is loc@@ ked in a va@@ ult of sil@@ ence and dar@@ k@@ ness inside your sk@@ ul@@ l .
"A@@ ll it ever se@@ es are elec@@ tro@@ chem@@ ical signals that come in along different data c@@ ab@@ les , and this is all it has to work with , and nothing more ."
And this is a very ef@@ fici@@ ent kind of machine .
"It &apos;s essenti@@ ally a gener@@ al pur@@ pose comput@@ ing dev@@ ice , and it just takes in everything and fig@@ ures out what it &apos;s going to do with it , and that , I think , fre@@ es up M@@ other N@@ ature to tin@@ k@@ er around with different sor@@ ts of in@@ put chan@@ nel@@ s ."
The brain fig@@ ures out what to do with the data that comes in .
"And when you look across the an@@ ima@@ l k@@ ing@@ dom , you find lots of peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al dev@@ ices ."
"So s@@ nak@@ es have he@@ at p@@ its with which to det@@ ect in@@ fr@@ ar@@ ed , and the gh@@ ost k@@ ni@@ fe@@ f@@ ish has elec@@ tro@@ re@@ cep@@ tors , and the star@@ -@@ nos@@ ed mo@@ le has this app@@ en@@ da@@ ge with 2@@ 2 f@@ ing@@ ers on it with which it fe@@ els around and con@@ struc@@ ts a 3@@ D mo@@ de@@ l of the world , and many bir@@ ds have mag@@ n@@ et@@ ite so they can ori@@ ent to the magnetic field of the planet ."
So what this means is that nature doesn &apos;t have to contin@@ ually re@@ des@@ ign the brain .
"In@@ ste@@ ad , with the princi@@ pl@@ es of brain oper@@ ation est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed , all nature has to wor@@ ry about is des@@ ig@@ ning new peri@@ ph@@ er@@ als ."
O@@ kay . So what this means is this : The les@@ son that sur@@ fac@@ es is that there &apos;s nothing really speci@@ al or fundam@@ ental about the bi@@ ology that we come to the table with .
It &apos;s just what we have in@@ her@@ ited from a compl@@ e@@ x ro@@ ad of evolution .
"But it &apos;s not what we have to s@@ tic@@ k with , and our best pro@@ of of princi@@ ple of this comes from what &apos;s called sen@@ s@@ ory sub@@ st@@ it@@ ution ."
"Now , that might sound spec@@ ul@@ ative , but the first p@@ ap@@ er demon@@ stra@@ ting this was published in the jour@@ n@@ al N@@ ature in 19@@ 6@@ 9 ."
Why the for@@ e@@ head ? Because you &apos;re not using it for much else .
"The most modern in@@ car@@ na@@ tion is called the bra@@ in@@ port , and this is a little elec@@ t@@ rog@@ ri@@ d that s@@ its on your t@@ on@@ gu@@ e , and the video fe@@ ed gets turned into these little elec@@ tro@@ t@@ ac@@ t@@ ile signals , and bl@@ ind people get so good at using this that they can th@@ row a b@@ all into a bas@@ k@@ et , or they can nav@@ i@@ ga@@ te compl@@ e@@ x ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le cour@@ ses ."
They can come to see through their t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
"Now , that s@@ oun@@ ds complet@@ ely in@@ san@@ e , right ?"
"But remem@@ ber , all vision ever is is elec@@ tro@@ chem@@ ical signals cour@@ sing around in your brain ."
Y@@ our brain doesn &apos;t know where the signals come from .
It just fig@@ ures out what to do with them .
"And we wanted to do this , giv@@ en the power and ub@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of por@@ table comput@@ ing , we wanted to make sure that this would ru@@ n on cell ph@@ ones and t@@ ab@@ l@@ ets , and also we wanted to make this a we@@ ar@@ able , something that you could we@@ ar under your c@@ lo@@ thing ."
So here &apos;s the con@@ cept .
"So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing , my sound is getting cap@@ tu@@ red by the t@@ ab@@ let , and then it &apos;s getting ma@@ pped on@@ to a v@@ est that &apos;s c@@ over@@ ed in vibra@@ t@@ ory mo@@ tors , just like the mo@@ tors in your cell ph@@ one . So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing ,"
the sound is getting trans@@ l@@ ated to a pat@@ tern of vibra@@ tion on the v@@ est .
"Now , this is not just con@@ cep@@ tu@@ al : this t@@ ab@@ let is trans@@ mit@@ ting B@@ l@@ u@@ et@@ o@@ ot@@ h , and I &apos;m we@@ ar@@ ing the v@@ est right now ."
So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing — ( Applause ) — the sound is getting trans@@ l@@ ated into d@@ y@@ na@@ mic pat@@ ter@@ n@@ s of vibra@@ tion .
I &apos;m feel@@ ing the son@@ ic world around me .
"So , we &apos;ve been t@@ es@@ ting this with de@@ a@@ f people now , and it turns out that after just a little bit of time , people can start feel@@ ing , they can start understanding the language of the v@@ est ."
So this is J@@ on@@ a@@ than . He &apos;s 3@@ 7 years old . He has a ma@@ st@@ er &apos;s de@@ g@@ ree .
"He was born prof@@ ou@@ nd@@ ly de@@ a@@ f , which means that there &apos;s a part of his um@@ w@@ el@@ t that &apos;s un@@ av@@ a@@ il@@ able to him ."
"So we had J@@ on@@ a@@ than tra@@ in with the v@@ est for four days , two h@@ ours a day , and here he is on the fi@@ f@@ th day ."
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t N@@ ov@@ ich : You .
S@@ N : Wh@@ ere . Wh@@ ere .
D@@ E : J@@ on@@ a@@ than is able to trans@@ l@@ ate this compl@@ ic@@ ated pat@@ tern of vibra@@ tions into an understanding of what &apos;s being said .
S@@ N : T@@ ou@@ ch . T@@ ou@@ ch .
"Now , this technology has the p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al to be a game@@ -@@ chan@@ ger , because the only other sol@@ ution for de@@ af@@ ness is a co@@ ch@@ lear im@@ pl@@ ant , and that requ@@ ir@@ es an inv@@ as@@ ive sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"And this can be built for 40 times che@@ ap@@ er than a co@@ ch@@ lear im@@ pl@@ ant , which op@@ ens up this technology glob@@ ally , even for the poor@@ est countries ."
"Now , we &apos;ve been very en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed by our results with sen@@ s@@ ory sub@@ st@@ it@@ ution , but what we &apos;ve been thinking a lot about is sen@@ s@@ ory ad@@ d@@ ition ."
"@@ How could we use a technology like this to ad@@ d a complet@@ ely new kind of sense , to exp@@ and the human um@@ vel@@ t ?"
"For example , could we fe@@ ed real@@ -@@ time data from the Inter@@ net direc@@ tly into somebody &apos;s brain , and can they devel@@ op a direc@@ t per@@ cep@@ tu@@ al experience ?"
So here &apos;s an experiment we &apos;re doing in the la@@ b .
"Th@@ en , two b@@ ut@@ t@@ ons ap@@ pe@@ ar , and he has to make a cho@@ ice ."
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
"He doesn &apos;t know that what we &apos;re fe@@ ed@@ ing is real@@ -@@ time data from the st@@ ock mark@@ et , and he &apos;s making buy and s@@ ell dec@@ is@@ ions ."
( Laughter ) And the fe@@ ed@@ back is telling him whether he did the right thing or not .
"And what we &apos;re see@@ ing is , can we exp@@ and the human um@@ vel@@ t so that he comes to have , after s@@ ever@@ al weeks , a direc@@ t per@@ cep@@ tu@@ al experience of the economic mov@@ ements of the planet ."
So we &apos;ll re@@ port on that later to see how well this goes .
"( Laughter ) Here &apos;s another thing we &apos;re doing : D@@ uring the tal@@ ks this mor@@ ning , we &apos;ve been a@@ ut@@ o@@ ma@@ tically sc@@ ra@@ ping T@@ wit@@ ter for the TE@@ D@@ 20@@ 15 h@@ ash@@ ta@@ g , and we &apos;ve been doing an a@@ ut@@ o@@ mat@@ ed senti@@ ment anal@@ y@@ sis , which means , are people using positive words or nega@@ tive words or ne@@ ut@@ ral ?"
"And while this has been going on , I have been feel@@ ing this , and so I am pl@@ ug@@ g@@ ed in to the ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ te emo@@ tion of thousands of people in real time , and that &apos;s a new kind of human experience , because now I can know how everyone &apos;s doing and how much you &apos;re lov@@ ing this ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a big@@ ger experience than a human can nor@@ m@@ ally have .
We &apos;re also exp@@ anding the um@@ vel@@ t of p@@ il@@ ots .
"So in this case , the v@@ est is stre@@ am@@ ing n@@ ine different meas@@ ures from this qu@@ ad@@ cop@@ ter , so p@@ it@@ ch and y@@ a@@ w and ro@@ ll and ori@@ ent@@ ation and he@@ ad@@ ing , and that impro@@ ves this p@@ il@@ ot &apos;s abil@@ ity to f@@ ly it ."
"It &apos;s essenti@@ ally like he &apos;s ext@@ end@@ ing his sk@@ in up there , far away ."
And that &apos;s just the beginning .
"What we &apos;re en@@ vis@@ ion@@ ing is tak@@ ing a modern co@@ c@@ k@@ p@@ it ful@@ l of ga@@ ug@@ es and instead of trying to read the whole thing , you feel it ."
"We live in a world of information now , and there is a difference between acc@@ ess@@ ing big data and experiencing it ."
So I think there &apos;s really no end to the possibil@@ ities on the horiz@@ on for human ex@@ pan@@ sion .
"@@ Just imagine an ast@@ ro@@ na@@ ut being able to feel the over@@ all health of the Inter@@ national S@@ p@@ ace St@@ ation , or , for that matter , having you feel the inv@@ is@@ ible states of your own health , like your blo@@ od su@@ ga@@ r and the state of your mic@@ rob@@ i@@ ome , or having 3@@ 6@@ 0-@@ de@@ g@@ ree vision or see@@ ing in in@@ fr@@ ar@@ ed or ul@@ tr@@ av@@ i@@ ol@@ et ."
"So the k@@ ey is this : A@@ s we move into the future , we &apos;re going to increas@@ ing@@ ly be able to cho@@ ose our own peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al dev@@ ices ."
"We no longer have to wa@@ it for M@@ other N@@ ature &apos;s sen@@ s@@ ory gi@@ f@@ ts on her tim@@ es@@ cal@@ es , but instead , like any good par@@ ent , she &apos;s giv@@ en us the to@@ ols that we need to go out and defin@@ e our own tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory ."
"So the question now is , how do you want to go out and experience your universe ?"
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris A@@ nd@@ er@@ son : Can you feel it ? D@@ E : Y@@ e@@ ah .
"A@@ c@@ tually , this was the first time I f@@ el@@ t ap@@ plause on the v@@ est ."
It &apos;s n@@ ice . It &apos;s like a mas@@ sage . ( Laughter ) C@@ A : T@@ wit@@ ter &apos;s going cra@@ z@@ y . T@@ wit@@ ter &apos;s going mad .
So that st@@ ock mark@@ et experiment .
"D@@ E : Well , that &apos;s right , I wouldn &apos;t have to w@@ r@@ ite to N@@ I@@ H any@@ more ."
So what that t@@ ells us is that the cor@@ te@@ x is kind of a on@@ e-@@ tric@@ k pon@@ y .
It just run@@ s certain kinds of comput@@ ations on things .
"And when we look around at things like bra@@ il@@ le , for example , people are getting information through b@@ um@@ ps on their f@@ ing@@ ers ."
So I don &apos;t think we have any reason to think there &apos;s a the@@ or@@ e@@ tical lim@@ it that we know the edge of .
"C@@ A : I@@ f this ch@@ ec@@ ks out , you &apos;re going to be del@@ ug@@ ed ."
There are so many possible ap@@ plic@@ ations for this .
"A@@ re you ready for this ? What are you most exc@@ ited about , the direc@@ tion it might go ?"
"So this is a way of just feel@@ ing the state of something , just like the way you know the state of your body as you &apos;re st@@ anding around ."
"So I think he@@ av@@ y ma@@ chin@@ ery , saf@@ ety , feel@@ ing the state of a fac@@ t@@ ory , of your equ@@ ip@@ ment , that &apos;s one place it &apos;ll go right away ."
"C@@ A : D@@ av@@ id E@@ ag@@ le@@ man , that was one min@@ d@@ -@@ blo@@ wing talk . Thank you very much ."
"D@@ E : Thank you , Ch@@ ris . ( Applause )"
It &apos;s really a fail@@ ure to det@@ ect a certain kind of dan@@ ger .
And that respon@@ se is part of the problem .
"I am un@@ able to mar@@ sh@@ al this respon@@ se , and I &apos;m giving this talk ."
It &apos;s as though we st@@ and before two do@@ ors .
O@@ ur computer har@@ d@@ w@@ are and sof@@ tw@@ are just st@@ op@@ s getting better for some reason .
Now take a moment to cons@@ ider why this might happen .
What could stop us from doing this ?
A ful@@ l@@ -@@ sc@@ ale n@@ uc@@ lear war ?
A global pan@@ de@@ mic ?
A@@ n as@@ ter@@ o@@ id im@@ p@@ act ?
J@@ us@@ tin Bi@@ eb@@ er becom@@ ing pres@@ ident of the United States ?
But that isn &apos;t the most lik@@ ely scen@@ ari@@ o .
It &apos;s not that our ma@@ chin@@ es will become spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously mal@@ evol@@ ent .
Just think about how we rel@@ ate to an@@ ts .
We don &apos;t h@@ ate them .
"Now , I sus@@ p@@ ect this seems far@@ -@@ f@@ et@@ ched to many of you ."
And there are only three of them .
In@@ t@@ ellig@@ ence is a matter of information proc@@ ess@@ ing in physical sy@@ st@@ ems .
The second as@@ s@@ um@@ p@@ tion is that we will keep going .
We will contin@@ ue to impro@@ ve our intellig@@ ent ma@@ chin@@ es .
We want to c@@ ure dis@@ eas@@ es like Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s and can@@ cer .
We want to understand economic sy@@ st@@ ems . We want to impro@@ ve our cli@@ mate science .
"So we will do this , if we can ."
"Now , just cons@@ ider the s@@ mart@@ est person who has ever liv@@ ed ."
O@@ n almost everyone &apos;s shor@@ t@@ l@@ ist here is Jo@@ h@@ n v@@ on Ne@@ um@@ an@@ n .
Here we have Jo@@ h@@ n v@@ on Ne@@ um@@ an@@ n .
And then we have you and me .
And it &apos;s important to recogni@@ ze that this is true by vir@@ tu@@ e of spe@@ ed alone .
So we &apos;re talking about the end of human dr@@ ud@@ g@@ ery .
We &apos;re also talking about the end of most int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ al work .
So what would ap@@ es like ourselves do in this cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance ?
"Well , we &apos;d be f@@ ree to pl@@ ay F@@ ris@@ be@@ e and give each other mas@@ sa@@ g@@ es ."
This is a w@@ in@@ ner@@ -@@ tak@@ e-@@ all scen@@ ari@@ o .
"And if you hav@@ en &apos;t not@@ ic@@ ed , 50 years is not what it used to be ."
This is how long we &apos;ve had the i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
This is how long &quot; &quot; The S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ ons &quot; &quot; has been on t@@ el@@ ev@@ is@@ ion .
G@@ et ready . &quot; &quot; And now we &apos;re just coun@@ ting down the months until the mo@@ ther@@ ship lan@@ ds ?
We would feel a little more ur@@ gen@@ cy than we do .
"&quot; O@@ h , you &apos;re feel@@ ing depres@@ sed ? Just sh@@ ake it off ; it &apos;s all in your head . &quot;"
"Now , ad@@ ults get tric@@ ked this way as well , all the time ."
"You see , that &apos;s why so many people fun@@ c@@ tion b@@ el@@ ow their ac@@ tu@@ al p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al ."
Why ? Because of poor emo@@ tional hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e .
T@@ o r@@ um@@ in@@ ate means to ch@@ ew over .
He had vis@@ ible tu@@ mor@@ s all over his body .
And he had to start a h@@ ars@@ h course of ch@@ emo@@ ther@@ ap@@ y .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
I want to make a case .
He created this experiment that is used in many other experim@@ ents in behav@@ i@@ or@@ al science .
I bring you into a room .
"He ga@@ ther@@ ed his parti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts and said : &quot; I &apos;m going to time you , how quickly you can sol@@ ve this problem . &quot;"
In@@ c@@ enti@@ vi@@ ze them .
It d@@ ul@@ ls thinking and b@@ loc@@ ks cre@@ ati@@ vity .
"And I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even cl@@ ose ."
"@@ R@@ e@@ wards , by their very nature , nar@@ row our f@@ oc@@ us , con@@ cent@@ ra@@ te the mind ; that &apos;s why they work in so many c@@ as@@ es ."
Let me tell you why this is so important .
"I &apos;m not telling a story , I &apos;m making a case ."
Do you know who spon@@ sor@@ ed this research ?
The good news is that the scient@@ ists who &apos;ve been stud@@ ying mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation have giv@@ en us this new approach .
A@@ ut@@ on@@ om@@ y : the ur@@ ge to direc@@ t our own lives .
M@@ ast@@ ery : the des@@ ire to get better and better at something that mat@@ ters .
I want to talk today only about a@@ ut@@ on@@ om@@ y .
"In the 20@@ th century , we came up with this idea of man@@ ag@@ ement ."
M@@ an@@ ag@@ ement did not em@@ an@@ ate from nature .
S@@ omebody inv@@ ent@@ ed it .
"But if you want en@@ gag@@ ement , self-@@ direc@@ tion works better ."
How many of you have heard of the comp@@ any A@@ t@@ las@@ si@@ an ?
And they do something incredi@@ bly co@@ ol .
"A@@ ut@@ on@@ om@@ y , ma@@ st@@ ery and pur@@ pose , the buil@@ ding b@@ loc@@ ks of a new way of doing things ."
"A few years later , another enc@@ y@@ c@@ lo@@ p@@ ed@@ ia got started ."
The dr@@ ive to do things cause they matter .
And here &apos;s the best part .
We already know this .
Jo@@ e K@@ ow@@ an : I have st@@ age f@@ right .
"I &apos;ve always had st@@ age f@@ right , and not just a little bit , it &apos;s a big bit ."
And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 2@@ 7 .
I had this ir@@ ra@@ tional fear .
There were like 20 people there .
"But I took a de@@ ep bre@@ ath , and I sign@@ ed up to pl@@ ay , and I f@@ el@@ t pretty good ."
"Now , when you experience fear , your sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic nerv@@ ous system k@@ ic@@ ks in ."
"I mean , your nerv@@ ous system is an id@@ iot ."
And something good did happen — I had the tin@@ i@@ est little g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of that audi@@ ence connec@@ tion that I was hop@@ ing for .
And I wanted more . But I knew I had to get past this nerv@@ ous@@ ness .
"That only seems au@@ th@@ en@@ tic when I have st@@ age f@@ right , and the more nerv@@ ous I was , the better the son@@ g would be . E@@ as@@ y ."
"B@@ y having a son@@ g that expl@@ ained what was happening to me , while it was happening , that gave the audi@@ ence per@@ mis@@ sion to think about it ."
"And ev@@ ent@@ ually , over time , I didn &apos;t have to pl@@ ay the st@@ age f@@ right son@@ g at all ."
"E@@ x@@ cept for when I was really nerv@@ ous , like now . ( Laughter ) W@@ ould it be ok@@ ay if I play@@ ed the st@@ age f@@ right son@@ g for you ?"
( Applause ) Can I have a si@@ p of water ?
"I@@ mag@@ ine , if you will — a gi@@ ft ."
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
It &apos;s not too big — about the si@@ ze of a golf b@@ all .
So en@@ vision what it looks like all w@@ ra@@ pped up .
"But before I show you what &apos;s inside , I will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredible things for you ."
It will bring all of your family together .
You will feel lov@@ ed and app@@ re@@ ci@@ ated like never before and re@@ con@@ n@@ ect with friends and ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces you hav@@ en &apos;t heard from in years .
A@@ d@@ or@@ ation and ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ tion will over@@ wh@@ el@@ m you .
It will rec@@ alib@@ ra@@ te what &apos;s most important in your life .
It will re@@ defin@@ e your sense of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ ality and fa@@ it@@ h .
You &apos;ll have a new understanding and trust in your body .
You &apos;ll have un@@ sur@@ pas@@ sed v@@ it@@ ality and energy .
"You &apos;ll exp@@ and your v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary , me@@ et new people , and you &apos;ll have a heal@@ th@@ i@@ er lif@@ est@@ y@@ le ."
And get this — you &apos;ll have an e@@ igh@@ t@@ -@@ wee@@ k vac@@ ation of doing absol@@ ut@@ ely nothing .
You &apos;ll e@@ at coun@@ t@@ less g@@ our@@ met me@@ als .
F@@ lo@@ w@@ ers will ar@@ r@@ ive by the tr@@ uc@@ k@@ lo@@ ad .
"@@ People will say to you , &quot; You look great . H@@ ave you had any work done ? &quot;"
And you &apos;ll have a li@@ fe@@ time sup@@ ply of good dru@@ gs .
"You &apos;ll be challen@@ g@@ ed , in@@ sp@@ i@@ red , mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated and hum@@ bl@@ ed ."
Y@@ our life will have new me@@ an@@ ing .
"@@ Pe@@ ace , health , ser@@ en@@ ity , happiness , n@@ ir@@ v@@ ana ."
The pr@@ ice ?
"@@ $ 5@@ 5@@ ,000 , and that &apos;s an incredible de@@ al ."
B@@ y now I know you &apos;re d@@ ying to know what it is and where you can get one .
D@@ o@@ es A@@ maz@@ on car@@ ry it ?
D@@ o@@ es it have the Ap@@ ple lo@@ go on it ?
I@@ s there a wa@@ iting l@@ ist ?
Not lik@@ ely .
This gi@@ ft came to me about five months ago .
It looked more like this when it was all w@@ ra@@ pped up — not quite so pretty .
"And this , and then this ."
"It was a r@@ are ge@@ m — a brain tu@@ mo@@ r , h@@ em@@ an@@ gi@@ ob@@ las@@ t@@ om@@ a — the gi@@ ft that ke@@ e@@ ps on giving ."
"And while I &apos;m ok@@ ay now , I wouldn &apos;t w@@ ish this gi@@ ft for you ."
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
It prof@@ ou@@ nd@@ ly al@@ tered my life in ways I didn &apos;t exp@@ ect in all the ways I just shar@@ ed with you .
"So the next time you &apos;re fac@@ ed with something that &apos;s un@@ expec@@ ted , un@@ wanted and un@@ certain , cons@@ ider that it just may be a gi@@ ft ."
( Applause )
( Laughter ) I was af@@ ra@@ id of w@@ om@@ an@@ h@@ ood .
"@@ Not that I &apos;m not af@@ ra@@ id now , but I &apos;ve learned to pret@@ end ."
I &apos;ve learned to be fle@@ x@@ ible .
"In fact , I &apos;ve developed some interesting to@@ ols to help me de@@ al with this fear ."
Let me explain .
"B@@ ack in the &apos; 5@@ 0s and &apos; 6@@ 0s , when I was gro@@ wing up , little girls were sup@@ posed to be kind and thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful and pretty and g@@ ent@@ le and sof@@ t , and we were sup@@ posed to f@@ it into ro@@ les that were sort of sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ y — really not quite c@@ lear what we were sup@@ posed to be ."
( Laughter ) There were pl@@ ent@@ y of ro@@ le mod@@ els all around us .
"We had our mothers , our a@@ un@@ ts , our cou@@ sin@@ s , our s@@ ist@@ ers , and of course , the ever@@ -@@ pres@@ ent med@@ ia bomb@@ ar@@ ding us with imag@@ es and words , telling us how to be ."
Now my mother was different .
"She was a h@@ ome@@ mak@@ er , but she and I didn &apos;t go out and do gir@@ li@@ e things together , and she didn &apos;t buy me p@@ ink ou@@ t@@ f@@ its ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , she knew what I needed , and she b@@ ou@@ ght me a bo@@ ok of car@@ to@@ ons ."
And I just ate it up .
"I dre@@ w , and I dre@@ w , and since I knew that hu@@ mo@@ r was ac@@ cep@@ table in my family , I could dra@@ w , do what I wanted to do , and not have to per@@ form , not have to speak — I was very sh@@ y — and I could still get appro@@ v@@ al ."
I was la@@ un@@ ched as a car@@ to@@ on@@ ist .
"Now when we &apos;re young , we don &apos;t always know . We know there are rul@@ es out there , but we don &apos;t always know — we don &apos;t per@@ form them right , even though we are im@@ prin@@ ted at bir@@ th with these things , and we &apos;re told what the most important col@@ or in the world is ."
We &apos;re told what shape we &apos;re sup@@ posed to be in .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re told what to we@@ ar — ( Laughter ) — and how to do our h@@ air — ( Laughter ) — and how to be@@ have .
Now the rul@@ es that I &apos;m talking about are con@@ stan@@ tly being mon@@ it@@ or@@ ed by the culture .
"We &apos;re being cor@@ rec@@ ted , and the pri@@ mar@@ y pol@@ ic@@ em@@ en are women , because we are the car@@ ri@@ ers of the trad@@ ition ."
We pas@@ s it down from gener@@ ation to gener@@ ation .
Not only that — we always have this v@@ ag@@ ue not@@ ion that something &apos;s expec@@ ted of us .
"And on top of all off these rul@@ es , they keep chang@@ ing ."
"( Laughter ) We don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on half the time , so it p@@ ut@@ s us in a very t@@ en@@ u@@ ous position . ( Laughter )"
"Now if you don &apos;t like these rul@@ es , and many of us don &apos;t — I know I didn &apos;t , and I still don &apos;t , even though I fol@@ low them half the time , not quite a@@ w@@ are that I &apos;m follo@@ wing them — what better way than to change them &#91; than &#93; with hu@@ mo@@ r ?"
H@@ u@@ mo@@ r rel@@ ies on the trad@@ iti@@ ons of a society .
"It takes what we know , and it tw@@ ists it ."
"It takes the cod@@ es of behav@@ ior and the cod@@ es of d@@ ress , and it makes it un@@ expec@@ ted , and that &apos;s what el@@ ic@@ its a l@@ au@@ gh ."
Now what if you put together women and hu@@ mo@@ r ?
I think you can get change .
"Because women are on the ground flo@@ or , and we know the trad@@ iti@@ ons so well , we can bring a different vo@@ ice to the table ."
Now I started dra@@ wing in the middle of a lot of cha@@ os .
I gre@@ w up not far from here in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ .
"@@ d@@ uring the C@@ iv@@ il R@@ igh@@ ts movement , the as@@ sas@@ sin@@ ations , the W@@ at@@ er@@ ga@@ te he@@ ar@@ ings and then the f@@ em@@ in@@ ist movement , and I think I was dra@@ wing , trying to fig@@ ure out what was going on ."
"And then also my family was in cha@@ os , and I dre@@ w to try to bring my family together — ( Laughter ) — try to bring my family together with l@@ au@@ ghter ."
It didn &apos;t work .
"M@@ y par@@ ents got div@@ or@@ ced , and my sis@@ ter was ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed ."
But I found my place .
"I found that I didn &apos;t have to we@@ ar high he@@ els , I didn &apos;t have to we@@ ar p@@ ink , and I could feel like I f@@ it in ."
"Now when I was a little ol@@ der , in my 20@@ s , I realiz@@ ed there are not many women in car@@ to@@ on@@ ing ."
"And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe I can bre@@ ak the little gl@@ as@@ s ce@@ il@@ ing of car@@ to@@ on@@ ing , &quot; &quot; and so I did . I bec@@ ame a car@@ to@@ on@@ ist ."
"And then I thought — in my 4@@ 0s I started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t I do something ?"
"I always lov@@ ed political car@@ to@@ ons , so why don &apos;t I do something with the cont@@ ent of my car@@ to@@ ons to make people think about the st@@ up@@ id rul@@ es that we &apos;re follo@@ wing as well as l@@ au@@ gh ? &quot; &quot; Now my per@@ spec@@ tive is a particul@@ arly — ( Laughter ) — my per@@ spec@@ tive is a particul@@ arly American per@@ spec@@ tive ."
I can &apos;t help it . I live here .
"E@@ v@@ en though I &apos;ve tr@@ av@@ el@@ ed a lot , I still think like an American woman ."
"But I believe that the rul@@ es that I &apos;m talking about are univer@@ sa@@ l , of course — that each culture has its different cod@@ es of behav@@ ior and d@@ ress and trad@@ iti@@ ons , and each woman has to de@@ al with these same things that we do here in the U.S@@ ."
"C@@ on@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , we have ."
"W@@ omen , because we &apos;re on the ground , we know the trad@@ ition ."
We have ama@@ zing ant@@ en@@ na@@ e .
"Now my work l@@ ately has been to col@@ labor@@ ate with inter@@ national car@@ to@@ on@@ ists , which I so en@@ jo@@ y , and it &apos;s giv@@ en me a gre@@ ater app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation for the power of car@@ to@@ ons to get at the tr@@ uth , to get at the issu@@ es quickly and succ@@ inc@@ tly ."
"And not only that , it can get to the vie@@ wer through not only the int@@ ell@@ ect , but through the heart ."
"M@@ y work also has allowed me to col@@ labor@@ ate with women car@@ to@@ on@@ ists from across the world — countries such as S@@ au@@ di A@@ ra@@ b@@ ia , I@@ ra@@ n , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey , Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ ina , F@@ ran@@ ce — and we have sa@@ t together and l@@ au@@ gh@@ ed and tal@@ ked and shar@@ ed our diffic@@ ul@@ ties ."
And these women are working so hard to get their vo@@ ices heard in some very difficult cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces .
But I feel bl@@ ess@@ ed to be able to work with them .
"And we talk about how women have such strong per@@ cep@@ tions , because of our t@@ en@@ u@@ ous position and our ro@@ le as trad@@ iti@@ on@@ -@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s , that we can have the great p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al to be chan@@ ge@@ -@@ ag@@ ents ."
"And I think , I truly believe , that we can change this thing one l@@ au@@ gh at a time ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Applause ) ( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( Applause )
But what we &apos;re going to talk about in this is how we &apos;re going to the next level .
"We st@@ um@@ bl@@ ed on your video on de@@ ci@@ m@@ als , and it got through ."
The ones I started were much more pri@@ mit@@ ive .
And the K@@ h@@ an A@@ c@@ ade@@ my vide@@ os are there .
G@@ re@@ en means the stud@@ ent &apos;s already pro@@ fici@@ ent .
T@@ ell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
( Applause )
What are the mes@@ sa@@ g@@ es we tell the women that work with and for us ?
"I left S@@ an F@@ ran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , where I live , on M@@ on@@ day , and I was getting on the plan@@ e for this con@@ fer@@ ence ."
The three of us take this clas@@ s together .
W@@ omen do not ne@@ g@@ ot@@ i@@ ate for themselves in the work@@ force .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously . Why are you even asking ? &quot; &quot; I@@ f you ask women why they did a good job , what they &apos;ll say is someone hel@@ ped them , they got l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , they worked really hard ."
"B@@ o@@ y , it mat@@ ters a lot ."
But it &apos;s not that simple .
"And he gave the case out , both of them , to two groups of students ."
But that one word made a really big difference .
The bad news was that everyone li@@ ked H@@ o@@ ward .
This is the compl@@ ic@@ ation .
The data sho@@ ws this very c@@ lear@@ ly .
P@@ hy@@ l@@ lis R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ e@@ z : We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people cons@@ ider an un@@ us@@ ual fri@@ end@@ ship .
And it is .
"And yet , it fe@@ els natural to us now ."
"I first learned that my son had been in the World Tra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter on the mor@@ ning of S@@ e@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 1@@ th , 200@@ 1 ."
We didn &apos;t know if he had peri@@ shed yet until 3@@ 6 h@@ ours later .
"A@@ t the time , we knew that it was political ."
"We were af@@ ra@@ id of what our country was going to do in the na@@ me of our son — my h@@ us@@ b@@ and , O@@ r@@ lan@@ do , and I and our family ."
"And when I saw it — and yet , through the sh@@ ock , the ter@@ ri@@ ble sh@@ ock , and the ter@@ ri@@ ble expl@@ os@@ ion in our lives , liter@@ ally , we were not ven@@ ge@@ ful ."
"And a couple of weeks later when Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as M@@ ous@@ sa@@ ou@@ i was ind@@ ic@@ ted on six coun@@ ts of con@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ cy to com@@ mit ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m , and the U.S. govern@@ ment called for a de@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty for him , if con@@ vic@@ ted , my h@@ us@@ b@@ and and I sp@@ o@@ ke out in op@@ position to that , publ@@ ic@@ ly ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh that and through human ri@@ ghts groups , we were b@@ rou@@ ght together with s@@ ever@@ al other vic@@ tim@@ s &apos; famil@@ ies ."
"When I saw A@@ ich@@ a in the med@@ ia , coming over when her son was ind@@ ic@@ ted , and I thought , &quot; &quot; What a br@@ ave woman ."
S@@ ome@@ day I want to me@@ et that woman when I &apos;m st@@ ron@@ ger . &quot; &quot; I was still in de@@ ep g@@ ri@@ ef ; I knew I didn &apos;t have the str@@ en@@ g@@ th .
"I knew I would find her some@@ day , or we would find each other ."
"Because , when people heard that my son was a vic@@ ti@@ m , I got im@@ medi@@ ate sym@@ pa@@ thy ."
"But when people learned what her son was acc@@ used of , she didn &apos;t get that sym@@ pa@@ thy ."
But her suf@@ fer@@ ing is equal to min@@ e .
"So we met in N@@ ov@@ em@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and A@@ ich@@ a will now tell you how that came about ."
"( Trans@@ l@@ at@@ or ) A@@ ich@@ a el@@ -@@ W@@ af@@ i : G@@ ood af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , la@@ di@@ es and g@@ ent@@ l@@ em@@ en ."
I am the mother of Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as M@@ ous@@ sa@@ ou@@ i .
And I asked the O@@ r@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation of H@@ u@@ man R@@ igh@@ ts to put me in tou@@ ch with the par@@ ents of the vic@@ tim@@ s .
So they int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed me to five famil@@ ies .
"And I saw P@@ hy@@ l@@ lis , and I wat@@ ched her ."
She was the only mother in the group .
"The others were bro@@ thers , s@@ ist@@ ers ."
"And I saw in her ey@@ es that she was a mother , just like me ."
I suf@@ fer@@ ed a lot as a mother .
I was marri@@ ed when I was 14 .
"I lost a child when I was 15 , a second child when I was 1@@ 6 ."
So the story with Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as was too much really .
"And I still suf@@ fer , because my son is like he &apos;s bur@@ i@@ ed al@@ ive ."
I know she really cri@@ ed for her son .
But she kno@@ ws where he is .
"M@@ y son , I don &apos;t know where he is ."
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s al@@ ive . I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s t@@ or@@ tu@@ red .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
"So that &apos;s why I decided to tell my story , so that my suf@@ fer@@ ing is something positive for other women ."
"For all the women , all the mothers that give life , you can give back , you can change ."
"It &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children ."
We must be h@@ and@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ hand and do something together .
"It &apos;s not against women , it &apos;s for us , for us women , for our children ."
"I talk against violence , against ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m ."
"I go to schools to talk to young , M@@ us@@ li@@ m girls so they don &apos;t ac@@ cept to be marri@@ ed against their will very young ."
"So if I can sa@@ ve one of the young girls , and av@@ o@@ id that they get marri@@ ed and suf@@ fer as much as I did , well this is something good ."
This is why I &apos;m here in fron@@ t of you .
"@@ P@@ R : I would like to say that I have learned so much from A@@ ich@@ a , star@@ ting with that day we had our very first me@@ et@@ ing with other family mem@@ b@@ ers — which was a very pr@@ iv@@ ate me@@ et@@ ing with sec@@ ur@@ ity , because it was N@@ ov@@ em@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and , fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly , we were af@@ ra@@ id of the super@@ -@@ pat@@ ri@@ ot@@ ism of that time in the country — those of us family mem@@ b@@ ers ."
But we were all so nerv@@ ous .
&quot; Why does she want to me@@ et us ? &quot;
And then she was nerv@@ ous .
&quot; Why did we want to me@@ et her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
"B@@ e@@ fore we knew each others &apos; nam@@ es , or anything , we had em@@ bra@@ ced and we@@ p@@ t ."
"Th@@ en we sa@@ t in a cir@@ cle with sup@@ port , with help , from people experienc@@ ed in this kind of re@@ con@@ cil@@ i@@ ation ."
"And A@@ ich@@ a started , and she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if my son is gu@@ il@@ ty or in@@ n@@ oc@@ ent , but I want to tell you how sor@@ ry I am for what happened to your famil@@ ies ."
"I know what it is to suf@@ fer , and I feel that if there is a cri@@ me , a person should be tried fa@@ ir@@ ly and p@@ uni@@ shed . &quot; &quot; But she re@@ ach@@ ed out to us in that way , and it was , I &apos;d like to say , it was an ic@@ e-@@ bre@@ ak@@ er ."
"And what happened then is we all told our stories , and we all connec@@ ted as human be@@ ings ."
B@@ y the end of the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on — it was about three h@@ ours after l@@ un@@ ch — we &apos;d f@@ el@@ t as if we &apos;d known each other forever .
"Now what I learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so gener@@ ous under these pres@@ ent cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had ."
"I never had met someone with such a hard life , from such a tot@@ ally different culture and environ@@ ment from my own ."
"And I feel that we have a speci@@ al connec@@ tion , which I val@@ ue very much ."
"And I think it &apos;s all about being af@@ ra@@ id of the other , but making that ste@@ p and then realiz@@ ing , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , this wasn &apos;t so hard ."
"Wh@@ o else can I me@@ et that I don &apos;t know , or that I &apos;m so different from ? &quot; &quot; So , A@@ ich@@ a , do you have a couple of words for con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion ?"
Because our time is up .
"( Laughter ) ( Trans@@ l@@ at@@ or ) A@@ W : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other ."
"You have to be gener@@ ous , and your he@@ ar@@ ts must be gener@@ ous , your mind must be gener@@ ous ."
You must be t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant .
You have to fi@@ ght against violence .
And I hop@@ e that some@@ day we &apos;ll all live together in pe@@ ace and re@@ spec@@ ting each other .
This is what I wanted to say .

"In 200@@ 8 , C@@ y@@ cl@@ one N@@ arg@@ is dev@@ ast@@ ated M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r ."
M@@ il@@ lions of people were in s@@ ev@@ ere need of help .
The U.@@ N@@ . wanted to r@@ ush people and sup@@ p@@ lies to the are@@ a .
"But there were no ma@@ ps , no ma@@ ps of ro@@ ad@@ s , no ma@@ ps sho@@ wing h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als , no way for help to re@@ ach the c@@ y@@ cl@@ one vic@@ tim@@ s ."
"When we look at a ma@@ p of L@@ os A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ es or L@@ on@@ don , it is hard to believe that as of 200@@ 5 , only 15 percent of the world was ma@@ pped to a ge@@ o-@@ co@@ da@@ ble level of deta@@ il ."
The U.@@ N@@ . ra@@ n he@@ ad@@ first into a problem that the ma@@ jor@@ ity of the world &apos;s popul@@ ous fac@@ es : not having deta@@ il@@ ed ma@@ ps .
But help was coming .
"A@@ t Go@@ og@@ le , 40 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers used a new sof@@ tw@@ are to ma@@ p 1@@ 20@@ ,000 kilo@@ met@@ ers of ro@@ ad@@ s , 3@@ ,000 h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als , log@@ is@@ tics and rel@@ i@@ ef poin@@ ts ."
And it took them four days .
The new sof@@ tw@@ are they used ? Go@@ og@@ le M@@ ap@@ mak@@ er .
Go@@ og@@ le M@@ ap@@ mak@@ er is a technology that em@@ po@@ w@@ ers each of us to ma@@ p what we know loc@@ ally .

"In the last year alone , thousands of us@@ ers in 1@@ 70 countries have ma@@ pped mil@@ lions of piec@@ es of information , and created a ma@@ p of a level of deta@@ il never thought vi@@ able ."

"So , I was in the h@@ os@@ p@@ ital for a long time ."
"And a few years after I left , I went back , and the ch@@ air@@ man of the bur@@ n de@@ par@@ t@@ ment was very exc@@ ited to see me — said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , I have a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic new treat@@ ment for you . &quot; &quot; I was very exc@@ ited .

"And he expl@@ ained to me that , when I sh@@ ave , I have little black d@@ ots on the left side of my face where the h@@ air is , but on the right side of my face I was b@@ ad@@ ly b@@ urn@@ ed so I have no h@@ air , and this cre@@ ates l@@ ack of sym@@ me@@ try ."
And what &apos;s the br@@ il@@ li@@ ant idea he had ?
He was going to t@@ at@@ too little black d@@ ots on the right side of my face and make me look very sym@@ me@@ tri@@ c .
It s@@ ou@@ nd@@ ed interesting . He asked me to go and sh@@ ave .
"@@ Let me tell you , this was a strange way to sh@@ ave , because I thought about it and I realiz@@ ed that the way I was sh@@ av@@ ing then would be the way I would sh@@ ave for the rest of my life — because I had to keep the w@@ id@@ th the same ."
"When I got back to his of@@ fic@@ e , I wasn &apos;t really sure ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Can I see some evidence for this ? &quot; &quot; So he showed me some pic@@ tures of little che@@ e@@ ks with little black d@@ ots — not very informa@@ tive ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; What happens when I grow ol@@ der and my h@@ air becom@@ es wh@@ ite ?"
"What would happen then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , don &apos;t wor@@ ry about it , &quot; &quot; he said ."
&quot; We have las@@ ers ; we can wh@@ it@@ en it out . &quot;
"But I was still con@@ c@@ er@@ ned , so I said , &quot; &quot; You know what , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; And then came one of the big@@ gest gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ ps of my life ."
"This is coming from a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish guy , all right , so that means a lot ."
"( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , what &apos;s wrong with you ?"
Do you en@@ jo@@ y looking n@@ on@@ -@@ sym@@ me@@ tri@@ c ?
Do you have some kind of per@@ v@@ ert@@ ed pleas@@ ure from this ?
Do women feel p@@ ity for you and have sex with you more fre@@ qu@@ ently ? &quot; &quot; N@@ one of those happened .
"And this was very sur@@ pris@@ ing to me , because I &apos;ve g@@ one through many treat@@ ments — there were many treat@@ ments I decided not to do — and I never got this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p to this ext@@ ent ."
But I decided not to have this treat@@ ment .
"And I went to his dep@@ ut@@ y and asked him , &quot; &quot; What was going on ?"
"Wh@@ ere was this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p coming from ? &quot; &quot; And he expl@@ ained that they have done this proc@@ ed@@ ure on two patients already , and they need the th@@ ir@@ d pati@@ ent for a p@@ ap@@ er they were writ@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a s@@ ch@@ m@@ uc@@ k .
"@@ R@@ ight , that &apos;s what he seems like ."
But let me give you a different per@@ spec@@ tive on the same story .
"A few years ago , I was run@@ ning some of my own experim@@ ents in the la@@ b ."
"And when we ru@@ n experim@@ ents , we us@@ ually hop@@ e that one group will be@@ have differ@@ ently than another ."
"So we had one group that I hop@@ ed their per@@ for@@ man@@ ce would be very high , another group that I thought their per@@ for@@ man@@ ce would be very low , and when I got the results , that &apos;s what we got — I was very happy — as@@ ide from one person ."
There was one person in the group that was sup@@ posed to have very high per@@ for@@ man@@ ce that was actually per@@ form@@ ing ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"And he pul@@ led the whole mean down , des@@ tro@@ ying my stat@@ is@@ tical sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance of the test ."
So I looked c@@ are@@ fully at this guy .
He was 20@@ -@@ some years ol@@ der than any@@ body else in the sam@@ ple .
And I remem@@ ber@@ ed that the old and dr@@ un@@ ken guy came one day to the la@@ b wan@@ ting to make some easy c@@ as@@ h and this was the guy .
&quot; &quot; F@@ ant@@ as@@ tic ! &quot; &quot; I thought . &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s th@@ row him out .
"Wh@@ o would ever in@@ cl@@ u@@ de a dr@@ un@@ ken guy in a sam@@ ple ? &quot; &quot; But a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; &quot; What would have happened if this dr@@ un@@ ken guy was not in that con@@ d@@ ition ?"
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
"W@@ ould we have th@@ ro@@ wn him out then ? &quot; &quot; We probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ant@@ as@@ tic ! What a s@@ mart guy who is per@@ form@@ ing this low , &quot; &quot; because he would have pul@@ led the mean of the group lower , giving us even st@@ ron@@ ger stat@@ is@@ tical results than we could ."
So we decided not to th@@ row the guy out and to r@@ er@@ u@@ n the experiment .
"But you know , these stories , and lots of other experim@@ ents that we &apos;ve done on con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ts of inter@@ est , basically kind of bring two poin@@ ts to the for@@ e@@ ground for me ."
"The first one is that in life we en@@ coun@@ ter many people who , in some way or another , try to t@@ at@@ too our fac@@ es ."
They just have the inc@@ enti@@ ves that get them to be bl@@ ind@@ ed to reality and give us ad@@ vic@@ e that is in@@ her@@ ently bi@@ as@@ ed .
"And I &apos;m sure that it &apos;s something that we all recogni@@ ze , and we see that it happens ."
"M@@ aybe we don &apos;t recogni@@ ze it every time , but we understand that it happens ."
"The most difficult thing , of course , is to recogni@@ ze that some@@ times we too are bl@@ ind@@ ed by our own inc@@ enti@@ ves ."
"And that &apos;s a much , much more difficult les@@ son to take into ac@@ coun@@ t ."
Because we don &apos;t see how con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ts of inter@@ est work on us .
"When I was doing these experim@@ ents , in my mind , I was hel@@ ping science ."
I was el@@ im@@ in@@ ating the data to get the true pat@@ tern of the data to sh@@ ine through .
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
"In my mind , I was actually a k@@ ni@@ ght trying to help science move along ."
But this was not the case .
I was actually inter@@ fer@@ ing with the process with lots of good int@@ en@@ tions .
"And I think the real challenge is to fig@@ ure out where are the c@@ as@@ es in our lives where con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ts of inter@@ est work on us , and try not to trust our own in@@ tu@@ ition to over@@ come it , but to try to do things that pre@@ v@@ ent us from f@@ all@@ ing pre@@ y to these behav@@ i@@ ors , because we can create lots of und@@ es@@ i@@ ra@@ ble cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces ."
I do want to leave you with one positive thought .
"I mean , this is all very depres@@ sing , right — people have con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ts of inter@@ est , we don &apos;t see it , and so on ."
"The positive per@@ spec@@ tive , I think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the de@@ ep me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms of why we fa@@ il and where we fa@@ il , we can actually hop@@ e to fi@@ x things ."
"And that , I think , is the hop@@ e . Thank you very much ."
( Applause )
You all know the tr@@ uth of what I &apos;m going to say .
I think the in@@ tu@@ ition that inequ@@ ality is div@@ is@@ ive and soci@@ ally cor@@ ro@@ sive has been around since before the F@@ r@@ en@@ ch R@@ evolution .
"What &apos;s changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can comp@@ are societies , more and less equal societies , and see what inequ@@ ality does ."
I &apos;m going to take you through that data and then explain why the l@@ in@@ ks I &apos;m going to be sho@@ wing you ex@@ ist .
"But first , see what a mis@@ er@@ able lot we are ."
( Laughter ) I want to start though with a par@@ ad@@ o@@ x .
This sho@@ ws you life expec@@ tan@@ cy against gro@@ ss national income — how rich countries are on average .
"And you see the countries on the right , like N@@ or@@ way and the U@@ S@@ A , are tw@@ ice as rich as I@@ s@@ ra@@ el , G@@ re@@ ec@@ e , P@@ or@@ tu@@ ga@@ l on the left ."
And it makes no difference to their life expec@@ tan@@ cy at all .
There &apos;s no su@@ g@@ g@@ es@@ tion of a relation@@ ship there .
"But if we look within our societies , there are ex@@ tra@@ ordinary social gra@@ di@@ ents in health run@@ ning right across society ."
"This , again , is life expec@@ tan@@ cy ."
"Th@@ ese are small are@@ as of Engl@@ and and W@@ al@@ es — the poor@@ est on the right , the ri@@ ch@@ est on the left ."
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .
E@@ v@@ en the people just b@@ el@@ ow the top have less good health than the people at the top .
"So income means something very important within our societies , and nothing between them ."
"The ex@@ plan@@ ation of that par@@ ad@@ o@@ x is that , within our societies , we &apos;re looking at relati@@ ve income or social position , social stat@@ us — where we are in rel@@ ation to each other and the si@@ ze of the g@@ aps between us ."
"And as so@@ on as you &apos;ve got that idea , you should im@@ medi@@ ately won@@ der : what happens if we w@@ id@@ en the differ@@ ences , or com@@ pres@@ s them , make the income differ@@ ences big@@ ger or sm@@ all@@ er ?"
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m not using any hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical data .
I &apos;m tak@@ ing data from the U.@@ N@@ . — it &apos;s the same as the World B@@ ank has — on the sc@@ ale of income differ@@ ences in these rich developed mark@@ et democra@@ ci@@ es .
"The measure we &apos;ve used , because it &apos;s easy to understand and you can do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad it , is how much ri@@ ch@@ er the top 20 percent than the bot@@ tom 20 percent in each country ."
"And you see in the more equal countries on the left — Japan , F@@ in@@ l@@ and , N@@ or@@ way , Swed@@ en — the top 20 percent are about three and a half , four times as rich as the bot@@ tom 20 percent ."
"But on the more un@@ equal end — U.@@ K@@ . , P@@ or@@ tu@@ ga@@ l , U@@ S@@ A , S@@ ing@@ ap@@ ore — the differ@@ ences are tw@@ ice as big ."
"O@@ n that measure , we are tw@@ ice as un@@ equal as some of the other successful mark@@ et democra@@ ci@@ es ."
Now I &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
"We col@@ lec@@ ted data on problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents , the kind of problems that are more common at the bot@@ tom of the social l@@ ad@@ der ."
"In@@ ter@@ na@@ tion@@ ally com@@ par@@ able data on life expec@@ tan@@ cy , on kids &apos; ma@@ ths and liter@@ ac@@ y sc@@ or@@ es , on in@@ f@@ ant mo@@ rt@@ ality ra@@ t@@ es , h@@ om@@ ic@@ ide ra@@ t@@ es , pro@@ por@@ tion of the population in pris@@ on , te@@ en@@ age bir@@ th@@ ra@@ t@@ es , lev@@ els of trust , ob@@ es@@ ity , mental ill@@ ness — which in stan@@ dar@@ d diag@@ nos@@ tic clas@@ si@@ fic@@ ation in@@ cl@@ ud@@ es dru@@ g and al@@ co@@ h@@ ol ad@@ dic@@ tion — and social mobil@@ ity ."
We put them all in one inde@@ x .
They &apos;re all we@@ igh@@ ted equ@@ ally .
Wh@@ ere a country is is a sort of average sc@@ ore on these things .
"And there , you see it in rel@@ ation to the measure of inequ@@ ality I &apos;ve just sho@@ wn you , which I sh@@ all use over and over again in the data ."
The more un@@ equal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
It &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily cl@@ ose cor@@ rel@@ ation .
"But if you look at that same inde@@ x of health and social problems in rel@@ ation to G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a , gro@@ ss national income , there &apos;s nothing there , no cor@@ rel@@ ation any@@ more ."
"We were a little bit wor@@ ri@@ ed that people might think we &apos;d been cho@@ os@@ ing problems to su@@ it our arg@@ ument and just man@@ uf@@ ac@@ tu@@ red this evidence , so we also did a p@@ ap@@ er in the Brit@@ ish M@@ ed@@ ical J@@ our@@ n@@ al on the U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F inde@@ x of child well-being ."
It has 40 different comp@@ on@@ ents put together by other people .
"It cont@@ ains whether kids can talk to their par@@ ents , whether they have bo@@ o@@ ks at home , what im@@ mun@@ iz@@ ation ra@@ t@@ es are like , whether there &apos;s b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying at school ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing goes into it .
Here it is in rel@@ ation to that same measure of inequ@@ ality .
K@@ id@@ s do worse in the more un@@ equal societies .
H@@ igh@@ ly sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant relation@@ ship .
"But once again , if you look at that measure of child well-being , in rel@@ ation to national income per person , there &apos;s no relation@@ ship , no su@@ g@@ g@@ es@@ tion of a relation@@ ship ."
What all the data I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you so far says is the same thing .
The average well-being of our societies is not dep@@ end@@ ent any longer on national income and economic growth .
"That &apos;s very important in poor@@ er countries , but not in the rich developed world ."
But the differ@@ ences between us and where we are in rel@@ ation to each other now matter very much .
I &apos;m going to show you some of the se@@ par@@ ate b@@ its of our inde@@ x .
"@@ Here , for inst@@ ance , is trust ."
It &apos;s simply the pro@@ por@@ tion of the population who ag@@ ree most people can be tr@@ ust@@ ed .
It comes from the World V@@ al@@ ues S@@ ur@@ v@@ ey .
"You see , at the more un@@ equal end , it &apos;s about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others ."
"But in the more equal societies , it ris@@ es to 60 or 6@@ 5 percent ."
"And if you look at meas@@ ures of inv@@ ol@@ v@@ ement in commun@@ ity life or social cap@@ ital , very si@@ mil@@ ar relation@@ shi@@ ps cl@@ os@@ ely rel@@ ated to inequ@@ ality ."
"I may say , we did all this work tw@@ ice ."
"We did it first on these rich , developed countries , and then as a se@@ par@@ ate test b@@ ed , we re@@ pe@@ ated it all on the 50 American states — asking just the same question : do the more un@@ equal states do worse on all these kinds of meas@@ ures ?"
So here is trust from a gener@@ al social surv@@ ey of the f@@ ed@@ er@@ al govern@@ ment rel@@ ated to inequ@@ ality .
V@@ ery si@@ mil@@ ar sc@@ at@@ ter over a si@@ mil@@ ar ran@@ ge of lev@@ els of trust .
S@@ ame thing is going on .
B@@ as@@ ically we found that almost anything that &apos;s rel@@ ated to trust inter@@ na@@ tion@@ ally is rel@@ ated to trust amo@@ n@@ g@@ st the 50 states in that se@@ par@@ ate test b@@ ed .
We &apos;re not just talking about a flu@@ ke .
This is mental ill@@ ness .
W@@ H@@ O put together fig@@ ures using the same diag@@ nos@@ tic inter@@ vie@@ ws on ran@@ dom sam@@ pl@@ es of the population to allow us to comp@@ are ra@@ t@@ es of mental ill@@ ness in each society .
This is the percent of the population with any mental ill@@ ness in the prec@@ ed@@ ing year .
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that — whole societies with three times the level of mental ill@@ ness of others .
"And again , cl@@ os@@ ely rel@@ ated to inequ@@ ality ."
This is violence .
"Th@@ ese red d@@ ots are American states , and the bl@@ ue tri@@ an@@ gl@@ es are C@@ an@@ a@@ dian pro@@ vin@@ ces ."
But look at the sc@@ ale of the differ@@ ences .
It goes from 15 h@@ om@@ ic@@ id@@ es per million up to 150 .
This is the pro@@ por@@ tion of the population in pris@@ on .
"There &apos;s a about a t@@ en@@ f@@ old difference there , lo@@ g sc@@ ale up the side ."
But it goes from about 40 to 4@@ 00 people in pris@@ on .
That relation@@ ship is not main@@ ly driv@@ en by more cri@@ me .
"In some plac@@ es , that &apos;s part of it ."
"But most of it is about more p@@ un@@ itive s@@ ent@@ enc@@ ing , har@@ sh@@ er s@@ ent@@ enc@@ ing ."
And the more un@@ equal societies are more lik@@ ely also to re@@ tain the de@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty .
Here we have children dro@@ p@@ ping out of high school .
"A@@ ga@@ in , quite big differ@@ ences ."
"E@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily da@@ mag@@ ing , if you &apos;re talking about using the tal@@ ents of the population ."
This is social mobil@@ ity .
It &apos;s actually a measure of mobil@@ ity based on income .
"B@@ as@@ ically , it &apos;s asking : do rich fa@@ thers have rich s@@ ons and poor fa@@ thers have poor s@@ ons , or is there no relation@@ ship between the two ?"
"And at the more un@@ equal end , fa@@ thers &apos; income is much more important — in the U.@@ K@@ . , U@@ S@@ A ."
"And in S@@ c@@ and@@ in@@ av@@ ian countries , fa@@ thers &apos; income is much less important ."
There &apos;s more social mobil@@ ity .
"And as we like to say — and I know there are a lot of Americ@@ ans in the audi@@ ence here — if Americ@@ ans want to live the American dre@@ am , they should go to D@@ en@@ mar@@ k ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you just a few things in it@@ al@@ ics here .
I could have sho@@ wn a number of other problems .
They &apos;re all problems that t@@ end to be more common at the bot@@ tom of the social gra@@ di@@ ent .
"But there are en@@ dl@@ ess problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents that are worse in more un@@ equal countries — not just a little bit worse , but anything from tw@@ ice as common to 10 times as common ."
"Th@@ ink of the exp@@ en@@ se , the human cost of that ."
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you ear@@ li@@ er where we put it all together to make two poin@@ ts .
"One is that , in graph after graph , we find the countries that do worse , wh@@ at@@ ever the ou@@ t@@ come , seem to be the more un@@ equal ones , and the ones that do well seem to be the N@@ or@@ di@@ c countries and Japan ."
So what we &apos;re looking at is gener@@ al social dis@@ fun@@ c@@ tion rel@@ ated to inequ@@ ality .
"It &apos;s not just one or two things that go wrong , it &apos;s most things ."
"The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that , if you look at the bot@@ tom , Swed@@ en and Japan , they &apos;re very different countries in all sor@@ ts of ways ."
"The position of women , how cl@@ os@@ ely they keep to the n@@ uc@@ lear family , are on op@@ pos@@ ite ends of the pol@@ es in terms of the rich developed world ."
But another really important difference is how they get their gre@@ ater equ@@ ality .
"S@@ wed@@ en has hu@@ ge differ@@ ences in ear@@ n@@ ings , and it nar@@ ro@@ ws the ga@@ p through ta@@ x@@ ation , gener@@ al w@@ el@@ f@@ are state , gener@@ ous ben@@ ef@@ its and so on ."
Japan is rather different though .
It star@@ ts off with much sm@@ all@@ er differ@@ ences in ear@@ n@@ ings before ta@@ x .
It has lower ta@@ x@@ es .
It has a sm@@ all@@ er w@@ el@@ f@@ are state .
"And in our anal@@ y@@ sis of the American states , we find rather the same con@@ tra@@ st ."
"There are some states that do well through re@@ dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion , some states that do well because they have sm@@ all@@ er income differ@@ ences before ta@@ x ."
"So we con@@ cl@@ u@@ de that it doesn &apos;t much matter how you get your gre@@ ater equ@@ ality , as long as you get there some@@ how ."
"I am not talking about per@@ fect equ@@ ality , I &apos;m talking about what ex@@ ists in rich developed mark@@ et democra@@ ci@@ es ."
A@@ n@@ other really sur@@ pris@@ ing part of this picture is that it &apos;s not just the poor who are af@@ fec@@ ted by inequ@@ ality .
There seems to be some tr@@ uth in Jo@@ h@@ n D@@ on@@ ne &apos;s &quot; No man is an is@@ l@@ and . &quot;
"And in a number of studies , it &apos;s possible to comp@@ are how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social h@@ ier@@ arch@@ y ."
This is just one example .
It &apos;s in@@ f@@ ant mo@@ rt@@ ality .
S@@ ome Swed@@ es very kin@@ d@@ ly clas@@ si@@ fied a lot of their in@@ f@@ ant de@@ a@@ ths acc@@ ord@@ ing to the Brit@@ ish re@@ g@@ is@@ ter of gener@@ al soci@@ o@@ economic clas@@ si@@ fic@@ ation .
"And so it &apos;s an@@ ach@@ ron@@ is@@ tically a clas@@ si@@ fic@@ ation by fa@@ thers &apos; occ@@ up@@ ations , so single par@@ ents go on their own ."
"But then where it says &quot; &quot; low social clas@@ s , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s un@@ sk@@ il@@ led man@@ ual occ@@ up@@ ations ."
"It goes through to@@ wards the sk@@ il@@ led man@@ ual occ@@ up@@ ations in the middle , then the j@@ un@@ ior n@@ on@@ -@@ man@@ ual , going up high to the profes@@ si@@ onal occ@@ up@@ ations — doc@@ tors , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , direc@@ tors of larg@@ er comp@@ an@@ ies ."
You see there that Swed@@ en does better than Brit@@ ain all the way across the social h@@ ier@@ arch@@ y .
The big@@ gest differ@@ ences are at the bot@@ tom of society .
"But even at the top , there seems to be a small ben@@ ef@@ it to being in a more equal society ."
We show that on about five different s@@ ets of data c@@ over@@ ing educ@@ ati@@ onal ou@@ t@@ comes and health in the United States and inter@@ na@@ tion@@ ally .
"And that seems to be the gener@@ al picture — that gre@@ ater equ@@ ality makes most difference at the bot@@ tom , but has some ben@@ ef@@ its even at the top ."
But I should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
I think I &apos;m looking and talking about the psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial ef@@ fec@@ ts of inequ@@ ality .
"M@@ ore to do with feel@@ ings of super@@ i@@ or@@ ity and in@@ fer@@ i@@ or@@ ity , of being val@@ u@@ ed and dev@@ al@@ u@@ ed , re@@ spec@@ ted and dis@@ re@@ spec@@ ted ."
"And of course , those feel@@ ings of the stat@@ us comp@@ et@@ ition that comes out of that driv@@ es the cons@@ um@@ er@@ ism in our society ."
It also lead@@ s to stat@@ us in@@ sec@@ ur@@ ity .
"We wor@@ ry more about how we &apos;re j@@ ud@@ g@@ ed and seen by others , whether we &apos;re re@@ gar@@ ded as at@@ trac@@ tive , cl@@ ever , all that kind of thing ."
"The soci@@ al-@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments increase , the fear of those soci@@ al-@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments ."
"In@@ ter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , some par@@ al@@ le@@ l work going on in social psych@@ ology : some people re@@ vie@@ wed 20@@ 8 different studies in which vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers had been inv@@ ited into a psych@@ ological labor@@ at@@ ory and had their st@@ ress hor@@ mon@@ es , their respon@@ ses to doing st@@ res@@ s@@ ful t@@ as@@ ks , meas@@ ured ."
"And in the re@@ view , what they were interes@@ ted in see@@ ing is what kind of st@@ res@@ ses most rel@@ i@@ ably ra@@ ise lev@@ els of cor@@ t@@ is@@ ol , the cent@@ ral st@@ ress hor@@ mon@@ e ."
And the con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion was it was t@@ as@@ ks that in@@ cl@@ ud@@ ed soci@@ al-@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative thre@@ at — thre@@ at@@ s to self-@@ es@@ te@@ em or social stat@@ us in which others can nega@@ ti@@ vely j@@ ud@@ ge your per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
Th@@ ose kind of st@@ res@@ ses have a very particular ef@@ fect on the ph@@ y@@ si@@ ology of st@@ ress .
Now we have been c@@ rit@@ ic@@ iz@@ ed .
"O@@ f course , there are people who dis@@ like this stuff and people who find it very sur@@ pris@@ ing ."
"I should tell you though that when people c@@ rit@@ ici@@ ze us for pic@@ king and cho@@ os@@ ing data , we never pic@@ k and cho@@ ose data ."
"We have an absol@@ ute rul@@ e that if our data s@@ our@@ ce has data for one of the countries we &apos;re looking at , it goes into the anal@@ y@@ sis ."
"O@@ ur data s@@ our@@ ce decid@@ es whether it &apos;s rel@@ i@@ able data , we don &apos;t ."
O@@ ther@@ w@@ ise that would int@@ ro@@ duc@@ e bi@@ as .
What about other countries ?
There are 200 studies of health in rel@@ ation to income and equ@@ ality in the ac@@ ade@@ mic pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed jour@@ n@@ als .
"This isn &apos;t con@@ fin@@ ed to these countries here , h@@ id@@ ing a very simple demon@@ stra@@ tion ."
"The same countries , the same measure of inequ@@ ality , one problem after another ."
Why don &apos;t we contro@@ l for other fac@@ tors ?
Well we &apos;ve sho@@ wn you that G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a doesn &apos;t make any difference .
"And of course , others using more so@@ ph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated me@@ th@@ od@@ s in the liter@@ ature have contro@@ l@@ led for pov@@ erty and education and so on ."
What about c@@ au@@ sal@@ ity ?
C@@ or@@ rel@@ ation in itself doesn &apos;t pro@@ ve c@@ au@@ sal@@ ity .
We sp@@ end a good bit of time .
"And inde@@ ed , people know the c@@ au@@ sa@@ l l@@ in@@ ks quite well in some of these ou@@ t@@ comes ."
"The big change in our understanding of driv@@ ers of ch@@ ron@@ ic health in the rich developed world is how important ch@@ ron@@ ic st@@ ress from social s@@ our@@ ces is af@@ fec@@ ting the im@@ mun@@ e system , the car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ar system ."
"O@@ r for inst@@ ance , the reason why violence becom@@ es more common in more un@@ equal societies is because people are sen@@ s@@ itive to being looked down on ."
"I should say that to de@@ al with this , we &apos;ve got to de@@ al with the pos@@ t@@ -@@ ta@@ x things and the pre@@ -@@ ta@@ x things ."
"We &apos;ve got to con@@ stra@@ in income , the b@@ on@@ us culture in@@ comes at the top ."
I think we must make our b@@ os@@ ses ac@@ coun@@ table to their em@@ pl@@ o@@ ye@@ es in any way we can .
I think the tak@@ e-@@ home message though is that we can impro@@ ve the real qu@@ ality of human life by re@@ duc@@ ing the differ@@ ences in in@@ comes between us .
"S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly we have a h@@ and@@ le on the psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial well-being of whole societies , and that &apos;s exc@@ iting ."
Thank you .

"It may seem like we &apos;re quite re@@ mo@@ te from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the bas@@ ic ma@@ chin@@ ery of our cells is pretty much the same ."
Do you real@@ ize that we can take adv@@ ant@@ age and com@@ man@@ de@@ er the ma@@ chin@@ ery of a common bac@@ teri@@ um to produce the pro@@ te@@ in of human in@@ sul@@ in used to treat diab@@ e@@ tics ?
This is not like human in@@ sul@@ in ; this is the same pro@@ te@@ in that is chem@@ ically in@@ dis@@ t@@ ing@@ u@@ ish@@ able from what comes out of your pan@@ cre@@ as .
"And speak@@ ing of bac@@ ter@@ ia , do you real@@ ize that each of us car@@ ri@@ es in our g@@ ut more bac@@ ter@@ ia than there are cells in the rest of our body ?"
M@@ aybe 10 times more .
"I mean think of it , when A@@ n@@ t@@ on@@ i@@ o D@@ ama@@ si@@ o as@@ ks about your self-@@ imag@@ e , do you think about the bac@@ ter@@ ia ?"
O@@ ur g@@ ut is a wonder@@ fully h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ able environ@@ ment for those bac@@ ter@@ ia .
"It &apos;s war@@ m , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s mo@@ ist , it &apos;s very co@@ z@@ y ."
And you &apos;re going to pro@@ v@@ ide all the n@@ ut@@ r@@ ition that they could possi@@ bly want with no ef@@ for@@ t on their part .
"It &apos;s really like an E@@ as@@ y S@@ tre@@ et for bac@@ ter@@ ia , with the occ@@ asi@@ onal inter@@ r@@ up@@ tion of the un@@ int@@ end@@ ed for@@ ced r@@ ush to the ex@@ it ."
"But o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise , you are a wonderful environ@@ ment for those bac@@ ter@@ ia , just as they are essenti@@ al to your life ."
"They help in the di@@ g@@ es@@ tion of essenti@@ al n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ents , and they pro@@ t@@ ect you against certain dis@@ eas@@ es ."
But what will come in the future ?
A@@ re we at some kind of evolu@@ tion@@ ary equ@@ i@@ po@@ ise as a spec@@ ies ?
"O@@ r , are we des@@ tin@@ ed to become something different — something , perhaps , even better adap@@ ted to the environ@@ ment ?"
"Now let &apos;s take a ste@@ p back in time to the Big Bang , 14 billion years ago — the Earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years — the first sign@@ s of pro@@ to@@ -@@ life , maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth — the first multi@@ -@@ c@@ ell@@ ed organ@@ is@@ ms , perhaps as much as 8@@ 00 or a billion years ago — and then the human spec@@ ies , finally emer@@ ging in the last 1@@ 3@@ 0,000 years ."
"In this v@@ ast un@@ fin@@ i@@ shed sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y of the universe , life on Earth is like a bri@@ ef measure ; the an@@ ima@@ l k@@ ing@@ dom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small gra@@ ce not@@ e ."
That was us .
"That also con@@ st@@ it@@ utes the ent@@ ert@@ ain@@ ment por@@ tion of this talk , so I hop@@ e you en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed it ."
"( Laughter ) Now when I was a fre@@ sh@@ man in college , I took my first bi@@ ology clas@@ s ."
I was fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated by the el@@ e@@ gan@@ ce and be@@ a@@ ut@@ y of bi@@ ology .
"I bec@@ ame en@@ amo@@ red of the power of evolution , and I realiz@@ ed something very fundam@@ ental : in most of the ex@@ ist@@ ence of life in sing@@ le@@ -@@ c@@ ell@@ ed organ@@ is@@ ms , each cell simply d@@ ivid@@ es , and all of the gen@@ e@@ tic energy of that cell is car@@ ri@@ ed on in both daughter cells ."
"But at the time multi@@ -@@ c@@ ell@@ ed organ@@ is@@ ms come on@@ line , things start to change ."
S@@ ex@@ ual re@@ produc@@ tion ent@@ ers the picture .
"And very impor@@ tan@@ tly , with the int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion of s@@ ex@@ ual re@@ produc@@ tion that pas@@ ses on the gen@@ ome , the rest of the body becom@@ es exp@@ en@@ da@@ ble ."
"In fact , you could say that the in@@ ev@@ it@@ abil@@ ity of the de@@ ath of our bo@@ di@@ es ent@@ ers in evolu@@ tion@@ ary time at the same moment as s@@ ex@@ ual re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"Now I have to con@@ f@@ ess , when I was a college under@@ grad@@ u@@ ate , I thought , ok@@ ay , sex / de@@ ath , sex / de@@ ath , de@@ ath for sex — it se@@ em@@ ed pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with each pas@@ sing year , I &apos;ve come to have increas@@ ing d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts ."
"I &apos;ve come to understand the senti@@ ments of G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ urn@@ s , who was per@@ form@@ ing still in L@@ as V@@ e@@ ga@@ s well into his 9@@ 0s ."
"And one ni@@ ght , there &apos;s a k@@ n@@ ock at his h@@ ot@@ el room do@@ or ."
He ans@@ w@@ ers the do@@ or .
"S@@ tan@@ ding before him is a g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous , sc@@ ant@@ ily cl@@ ad sho@@ w@@ girl ."
"She looks at him and says , &quot; I &apos;m here for sup@@ er sex . &quot;"
"&quot; That &apos;s fin@@ e , &quot; says G@@ e@@ or@@ ge , &quot; I &apos;ll take the s@@ ou@@ p . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) I came to real@@ ize , as a physic@@ ian , that I was working to@@ ward a go@@ al which was different from the go@@ al of evolution — not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily cont@@ rad@@ ic@@ t@@ ory , just different ."
I was trying to pres@@ er@@ ve the body .
I wanted to keep us heal@@ thy .
I wanted to re@@ st@@ ore health from disease .
I wanted us to live long and heal@@ thy lives .
"E@@ vol@@ ution is all about pas@@ sing on the gen@@ ome to the next gener@@ ation , adap@@ ting and surviv@@ ing through gener@@ ation after gener@@ ation ."
"F@@ rom an evolu@@ tion@@ ary point of view , you and I are like the bo@@ os@@ ter ro@@ c@@ ket@@ s des@@ ign@@ ed to sen@@ d the gen@@ e@@ tic pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad into the next level of or@@ bit and then drop off into the se@@ a ."
"I think we would all understand the senti@@ ment that W@@ o@@ ody Al@@ l@@ en ex@@ pres@@ sed when he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to achi@@ eve im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality through my work ."
I want to achi@@ eve it through not d@@ ying . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ vol@@ ution does not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily fav@@ or the lon@@ g@@ est@@ -@@ liv@@ ed .
"It doesn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily fav@@ or the big@@ gest or the st@@ ron@@ gest or the fas@@ test , and not even the s@@ mart@@ est ."
E@@ vol@@ ution fav@@ ors those cre@@ atures best adap@@ ted to their environ@@ ment .
That is the sol@@ e test of surviv@@ al and success .
"A@@ t the bot@@ tom of the oc@@ e@@ an , bac@@ ter@@ ia that are ther@@ mo@@ ph@@ il@@ ic and can surv@@ ive at the ste@@ am v@@ ent he@@ at that would o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise produce , if f@@ ish were there , s@@ ous@@ -@@ v@@ ide co@@ o@@ ked f@@ ish , n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess , have man@@ ag@@ ed to make that a h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ able environ@@ ment for them ."
"So what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of hum@@ ans in evolution , and particul@@ arly as we look a@@ head to the next ph@@ ase , I would say that there are a number of possibil@@ ities ."
The first is that we will not evol@@ ve .
We have re@@ ach@@ ed a kind of equ@@ i@@ po@@ ise .
"And the reas@@ on@@ ing be@@ h@@ ind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , man@@ ag@@ ed to pres@@ er@@ ve a lot of gen@@ es that would o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise be sel@@ ec@@ ted out and be re@@ mov@@ ed from the population ."
"And secon@@ d@@ ly , we as a spec@@ ies have so con@@ fig@@ ured our environ@@ ment that we have man@@ ag@@ ed to make it adap@@ t to us as well as we adap@@ t to it ."
"And by the way , we im@@ mi@@ gra@@ te and cir@@ cul@@ ate and inter@@ mi@@ x so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the is@@ ol@@ ation that is nec@@ ess@@ ary for evolution to take place ."
"A second possibil@@ ity is that there will be evolution of the trad@@ iti@@ onal kind , natural , im@@ posed by the for@@ ces of nature ."
"And the arg@@ ument here would be that the wh@@ e@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able ."
"And as far as is@@ ol@@ ation goes , when we as a spec@@ ies do col@@ on@@ ize dis@@ tant planets , there will be the is@@ ol@@ ation and the environ@@ mental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way ."
"But there &apos;s a th@@ ir@@ d possibil@@ ity , an en@@ tic@@ ing , in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ gh@@ t@@ ening possibil@@ ity ."
"I call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution — the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gu@@ id@@ ed and ch@@ os@@ en by us as individ@@ u@@ als in the cho@@ ices that we will make ."
Now how could this come about ?
How could it be possible that we would do this ?
"C@@ on@@ s@@ ider , first , the reality that people today , in some cul@@ tures , are making cho@@ ices about their of@@ f@@ sp@@ r@@ ing ."
"They &apos;re , in some cul@@ tures , cho@@ os@@ ing to have more mal@@ es than f@@ em@@ al@@ es ."
"It &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individ@@ ual and the family are cho@@ os@@ ing ."
"Th@@ ink also , if it were possible ever for you to cho@@ ose , not simply to cho@@ ose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the gen@@ e@@ tic ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments that would c@@ ure or pre@@ v@@ ent dis@@ eas@@ es ."
What if you could make the gen@@ e@@ tic changes to el@@ im@@ in@@ ate diab@@ et@@ es or Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s or re@@ duc@@ e the ris@@ k of can@@ cer or el@@ im@@ in@@ ate st@@ ro@@ ke ?
W@@ ouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your gen@@ es ?
"If we look a@@ head , these kind of changes are going to be increas@@ ing@@ ly possible ."
"The H@@ u@@ man G@@ en@@ ome P@@ ro@@ ject started in 19@@ 9@@ 0 , and it took 1@@ 3 years ."
It cost 2@@ .@@ 7 billion dollars .
"The year after it was fin@@ i@@ shed in 200@@ 4 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months ."
"@@ To@@ day , you can have a complet@@ e se@@ qu@@ ence of the three billion b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s in the human gen@@ ome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a wee@@ k ."
"It won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ doll@@ ar human gen@@ ome , and it will be increas@@ ing@@ ly av@@ a@@ il@@ able for everyone ."
"@@ Just a wee@@ k ago , the N@@ ati@@ onal A@@ c@@ ade@@ my of En@@ gine@@ er@@ ing a@@ war@@ ded its D@@ ra@@ per P@@ ri@@ ze to F@@ ran@@ c@@ is Ar@@ n@@ old and W@@ il@@ le@@ m St@@ em@@ m@@ er , two scient@@ ists who inde@@ pen@@ den@@ tly developed te@@ ch@@ ni@@ qu@@ es to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the natural process of evolution to work fas@@ ter and to le@@ ad to des@@ i@@ ra@@ ble pro@@ te@@ ins in a more ef@@ fici@@ ent way — what F@@ ran@@ ces Ar@@ n@@ old call@@ s &quot; &quot; direc@@ ted evolution . &quot; &quot; A couple of years ago , the L@@ ask@@ er P@@ ri@@ ze was a@@ war@@ ded to the scient@@ ist S@@ h@@ in@@ y@@ a Y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took an ad@@ ult sk@@ in cell , a f@@ ib@@ rob@@ last , and by man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating just four gen@@ es , he in@@ duc@@ ed that cell to re@@ v@@ ert to a pl@@ ur@@ ip@@ ot@@ enti@@ al stem cell — a cell p@@ ot@@ enti@@ ally cap@@ ab@@ le@@ "
of becom@@ ing any cell in your body .
These changes are coming .
"The same technology that has produc@@ ed the human in@@ sul@@ in in bac@@ ter@@ ia can make vir@@ us@@ es that will not only pro@@ t@@ ect you against themselves , but in@@ duc@@ e im@@ mun@@ ity against other vir@@ us@@ es ."
"B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , there &apos;s an experim@@ ental tri@@ al going on with v@@ acc@@ ine against in@@ flu@@ en@@ z@@ a that has been gro@@ wn in the cells of a t@@ ob@@ acc@@ o pl@@ ant ."
Can you imagine something good coming out of t@@ ob@@ acc@@ o ?
"Th@@ ese are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be ever@@ more possible ."
I@@ mag@@ ine then just two other little changes .
"You can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your of@@ f@@ sp@@ r@@ ing ?"
"What if you could change the s@@ per@@ m and the ov@@ a , or change the new@@ ly f@@ ert@@ il@@ iz@@ ed eg@@ g , and give your of@@ f@@ sp@@ r@@ ing a better chan@@ ce at a heal@@ th@@ i@@ er life — el@@ im@@ in@@ ate the diab@@ et@@ es , el@@ im@@ in@@ ate the he@@ mo@@ ph@@ ilia , re@@ duc@@ e the ris@@ k of can@@ cer ?"
Wh@@ o doesn &apos;t want heal@@ th@@ i@@ er children ?
"And then , that same anal@@ y@@ tic technology , that same en@@ g@@ ine of science that can produce the changes to pre@@ v@@ ent disease , will also en@@ able us to ad@@ op@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ trib@@ utes , hy@@ per@@ -@@ cap@@ ac@@ ities — that better me@@ mor@@ y ."
"Wh@@ y not have the quic@@ k w@@ it of a K@@ en J@@ en@@ n@@ ings , es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally if you can au@@ g@@ ment it with the next gener@@ ation of the W@@ ats@@ on machine ?"
Why not have the quic@@ k t@@ wit@@ ch mus@@ cle that will en@@ able you to ru@@ n fas@@ ter and longer ?
Why not live longer ?
These will be ir@@ res@@ is@@ ti@@ ble .
"And when we are at a position where we can pas@@ s it on to the next gener@@ ation , and we can ad@@ op@@ t the at@@ trib@@ utes we want , we will have con@@ v@@ ert@@ ed ol@@ d@@ -@@ st@@ y@@ le evolution into ne@@ o-@@ evolution ."
"We &apos;ll take a process that nor@@ m@@ ally might requ@@ ire 10@@ 0,000 years , and we can com@@ pres@@ s it down to a thou@@ s@@ and years — and maybe even in the next 100 years ."
"Th@@ ese are cho@@ ices that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them ."
"W@@ ill we use these cho@@ ices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kin@@ der ?"
"O@@ r , will we sel@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely cho@@ ose different at@@ trib@@ utes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?"
"W@@ ill we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more uni@@ form , or more rob@@ ust and more ver@@ sat@@ ile ?"
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
"And most prof@@ ou@@ nd@@ ly of all , will we ever be able to devel@@ op the w@@ is@@ dom , and to in@@ her@@ it the w@@ is@@ dom , that we &apos;ll need to make these cho@@ ices w@@ is@@ ely ?"
"For better or worse , and so@@ on@@ er than you may think , these cho@@ ices will be up to us ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"One thing the world need@@ s , one thing this country des@@ per@@ ately need@@ s is a better way of conduc@@ ting our political deb@@ ates ."
We need to re@@ disc@@ over the lost art of democra@@ tic arg@@ ument .
I have a su@@ g@@ g@@ es@@ tion .
But we too r@@ ar@@ ely ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ate and de@@ f@@ end and arg@@ ue about those big moral questions in our polit@@ ics .
So what I would like to do today is have something of a disc@@ us@@ sion .
"F@@ irst , let me take a famo@@ us ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ er who w@@ ro@@ te about those questions of j@@ us@@ tice and moral@@ ity , give you a very shor@@ t lec@@ ture on Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le of an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ ens , Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le &apos;s theory of j@@ us@@ tice , and then have a disc@@ us@@ sion here to see whether Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le &apos;s ideas actually in@@ form the way we think and arg@@ ue about questions today ."
"So , are you ready for the lec@@ ture ?"
"A@@ c@@ c@@ ord@@ ing to Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le , j@@ us@@ tice means giving people what they des@@ er@@ ve ."
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the lec@@ ture .
"( Laughter ) Now , you may say , well , that &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous enough ."
The real questions be@@ g@@ in when it comes to arg@@ u@@ ing about who des@@ er@@ ves what and why .
T@@ ake the example of fl@@ utes .
S@@ up@@ pose we &apos;re dis@@ trib@@ ut@@ ing fl@@ utes .
Wh@@ o should get the best ones ?
Let &apos;s see what people — What would you say ?
Wh@@ o should get the best fl@@ ute ?
You can just call it out .
( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : R@@ an@@ dom . ) M@@ i@@ cha@@ el S@@ an@@ de@@ l : A@@ t ran@@ dom . You would do it by l@@ ot@@ t@@ ery .
O@@ r by the first person to r@@ ush into the h@@ all to get them .
How many say the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers ?
( Laughter ) But here &apos;s a har@@ der question .
"Wh@@ y do you think , those of you who v@@ ot@@ ed this way , that the best fl@@ utes should go to the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers ?"
P@@ et@@ er : The gre@@ at@@ est ben@@ ef@@ it to all .
M@@ S : The gre@@ at@@ est ben@@ ef@@ it to all .
We &apos;ll hear better music if the best fl@@ utes should go to the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers .
That &apos;s P@@ et@@ er ? ( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : P@@ et@@ er . ) M@@ S : A@@ ll right .
"Well , it &apos;s a good reason ."
We &apos;ll all be better off if good music is play@@ ed rather than ter@@ ri@@ ble music .
"But P@@ et@@ er , Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le doesn &apos;t ag@@ ree with you that that &apos;s the reason ."
That &apos;s all right .
Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le had a different reason for saying the best fl@@ utes should go to the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers .
"He says that to reason about just dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion of a thing , we have to reason about , and some@@ times arg@@ ue about , the pur@@ pose of the thing , or the social acti@@ vity — in this case , mus@@ ical per@@ for@@ man@@ ce ."
"And the point , the essenti@@ al nature , of mus@@ ical per@@ for@@ man@@ ce is to produce exc@@ ell@@ ent music ."
It &apos;ll be a happy b@@ y@@ produc@@ t that we &apos;ll all ben@@ ef@@ it .
"But when we think about j@@ us@@ tice , Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le says , what we really need to think about is the essenti@@ al nature of the acti@@ vity in question and the qu@@ al@@ ities that are wor@@ th hon@@ or@@ ing and ad@@ mir@@ ing and recogni@@ zing ."
"Now , fl@@ utes may seem ... the dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion of fl@@ utes may seem a tr@@ iv@@ i@@ al case ."
Let &apos;s take a cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary example of the dis@@ p@@ ute about j@@ us@@ tice .
It had to do with golf .
"C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ tin — a few years ago , C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ tin — did any of you hear about him ?"
"He was a very good golf@@ er , but he had a di@@ sa@@ bil@@ ity ."
"He had a bad le@@ g , a cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory problem , that made it very pain@@ ful for him to wal@@ k the course ."
"In fact , it car@@ ri@@ ed ris@@ k of in@@ j@@ ur@@ y ."
"He asked the P@@ G@@ A , the P@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ onal G@@ ol@@ fer@@ s &apos; A@@ s@@ soci@@ ation , for per@@ mis@@ sion to use a golf c@@ art in the P@@ G@@ A t@@ our@@ nam@@ ents ."
"They said , &quot; &quot; No ."
"Now that would give you an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ ant@@ age . &quot; &quot; He su@@ ed , and his case went all the way to the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , believe it or not , the case over the golf c@@ art , because the la@@ w says that the di@@ sa@@ bl@@ ed must be ac@@ com@@ mo@@ da@@ ted , pro@@ vid@@ ed the ac@@ com@@ mo@@ da@@ tion does not change the essenti@@ al nature of the acti@@ vity ."
"He says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a great golf@@ er ."
I want to comp@@ et@@ e .
But I need a golf c@@ art to get from one h@@ ole to the next . &quot; &quot; S@@ up@@ pose you were on the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
S@@ up@@ pose you were decid@@ ing the j@@ us@@ tice of this case .
How many here would say that C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ tin does have a right to use a golf c@@ art ?
"And how many say , no , he doesn &apos;t ?"
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s take a pol@@ l , show of h@@ ands ."
How many would rul@@ e in fav@@ or of C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ tin ?
And how many would not ? How many would say he doesn &apos;t ?
"A@@ ll right , we have a good div@@ is@@ ion of op@@ in@@ ion here ."
"S@@ ome@@ one who would not gr@@ ant C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ tin the right to a golf c@@ art , what would be your reason ?"
"@@ R@@ a@@ ise your hand , and we &apos;ll try to get you a mic@@ ro@@ ph@@ one ."
( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : It &apos;d be an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ ant@@ age . ) M@@ S : It would be an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ ant@@ age if he gets to r@@ ide in a golf c@@ art .
"A@@ ll right , those of you , I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf c@@ art wor@@ ry about an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ ant@@ age ."
How would you answer the ob@@ jec@@ tion ?
"@@ Y@@ es , all right ."
A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : The c@@ art &apos;s not part of the game .
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e : The c@@ art &apos;s not part of the game .
M@@ S : But what about walking from h@@ ole to h@@ ole ?
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e : It doesn &apos;t matter ; it &apos;s not part of the game .
M@@ S : W@@ al@@ king the course is not part of the game of golf ?
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e : Not in my bo@@ ok , it isn &apos;t ."
"M@@ S : A@@ ll right . S@@ ta@@ y there , Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ o has an answer for Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e ?
"A@@ ll right , who has an answer for Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e ?"
What would you say ?
"A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : The end@@ ur@@ ance el@@ ement is a very important part of the game , walking all those hol@@ es ."
M@@ S : W@@ al@@ king all those hol@@ es ?
That &apos;s part of the game of golf ? ( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely . ) M@@ S : What &apos;s your na@@ me ? ( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : W@@ ar@@ r@@ en . ) M@@ S : W@@ ar@@ r@@ en .
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e , what do you say to W@@ ar@@ r@@ en ?"
Ch@@ ar@@ ley : I &apos;ll s@@ tic@@ k to my or@@ ig@@ in@@ al th@@ esis .
W@@ ar@@ r@@ en : I am not a golf@@ er .
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ ley : And I am . ( M@@ S : O@@ kay . ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , it &apos;s interesting ."
"In the case , in the lower cour@@ t , they b@@ rou@@ ght in golf@@ ing gre@@ at@@ s to t@@ es@@ ti@@ f@@ y on this very issue ."
I@@ s walking the course essenti@@ al to the game ?
And they b@@ rou@@ ght in J@@ ack N@@ ic@@ k@@ la@@ us and Ar@@ n@@ old P@@ al@@ m@@ er .
And what do you sup@@ pose they all said ?
Y@@ es . They ag@@ re@@ ed with W@@ ar@@ r@@ en .
"They said , y@@ es , walking the course is str@@ en@@ u@@ ous physical ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise ."
The f@@ ati@@ gu@@ e fac@@ tor is an important part of golf .
And so it would change the fundam@@ ental nature of the game to give him the golf c@@ art .
"Now , not@@ ice , something interesting — Well , I should tell you about the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t first ."
The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t decided .
What do you sup@@ pose they said ?
"They said y@@ es , that C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ tin must be pro@@ vid@@ ed a golf c@@ art ."
"S@@ even to two , they rul@@ ed ."
"What was interesting about their rul@@ ing and about the disc@@ us@@ sion we &apos;ve just had is that the disc@@ us@@ sion about the right , the j@@ us@@ tice , of the matter dep@@ end@@ ed on fig@@ uring out what is the essenti@@ al nature of golf ."
And the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t j@@ us@@ tic@@ es w@@ re@@ st@@ led with that question .
"And J@@ us@@ tice St@@ ev@@ ens , writ@@ ing for the ma@@ jor@@ ity , said he had read all about the history of golf , and the essenti@@ al point of the game is to get very small b@@ all from one place into a h@@ ole in as few st@@ ro@@ k@@ es as possible , and that walking was not essenti@@ al , but inc@@ id@@ ental ."
"Now , there were two dis@@ s@@ ent@@ ers , one of wh@@ om was J@@ us@@ tice S@@ cal@@ ia ."
"He wouldn &apos;t have gr@@ an@@ ted the c@@ art , and he had a very interesting dis@@ s@@ ent ."
It &apos;s interesting because he re@@ jec@@ ted the Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ el@@ ian pre@@ mis@@ e under@@ l@@ ying the ma@@ jor@@ ity &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
&quot; &quot; T@@ o say that something is essenti@@ al is ordin@@ ar@@ ily to say that it is nec@@ ess@@ ary to the achi@@ ev@@ ement of a certain ob@@ ject .
J@@ us@@ tice S@@ cal@@ ia &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion is ques@@ tion@@ able for two reas@@ ons .
"F@@ irst , no real spor@@ ts f@@ an would talk that way ."
"( Laughter ) I@@ f we had thought that the rul@@ es of the spor@@ ts we care about are mer@@ ely ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary , rather than des@@ ign@@ ed to call for@@ th the vir@@ tu@@ es and the exc@@ ell@@ ences that we think are wor@@ thy of ad@@ mir@@ ing , we wouldn &apos;t care about the ou@@ t@@ come of the game ."
It &apos;s also ob@@ jec@@ tion@@ able on a second ground .
"O@@ n the face of it , it se@@ em@@ ed to be — this deb@@ ate about the golf c@@ art — an arg@@ ument about fa@@ ir@@ ness , what &apos;s an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ ant@@ age ."
"But if fa@@ ir@@ ness were the only thing at st@@ ake , there would have been an easy and ob@@ vi@@ ous sol@@ ution ."
"But l@@ etting everyone r@@ ide in a c@@ art would have been , I sus@@ p@@ ect , more an@@ a@@ them@@ a to the golf@@ ing gre@@ at@@ s and to the P@@ G@@ A , even than making an ex@@ cep@@ tion for C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ tin ."
Why ?
Let me put the point as del@@ ic@@ ately as possible : G@@ ol@@ fer@@ s are a little sen@@ s@@ itive about the a@@ th@@ le@@ tic stat@@ us of their game .

"So if golf@@ ing is the kind of game that can be play@@ ed while r@@ id@@ ing around in a golf c@@ art , it would be hard to con@@ fer on the golf@@ ing gre@@ at@@ s the stat@@ us that we con@@ fer , the hon@@ or and rec@@ ognition that goes to truly great a@@ th@@ l@@ et@@ es ."
"That ill@@ u@@ stra@@ t@@ es that with golf , as with fl@@ utes , it &apos;s hard to dec@@ ide the question of what j@@ us@@ tice requ@@ ir@@ es , without grap@@ pl@@ ing with the question , &quot; &quot; What is the essenti@@ al nature of the acti@@ vity in question , and what qu@@ al@@ ities , what exc@@ ell@@ ences connec@@ ted with that acti@@ vity , are wor@@ thy of hon@@ or and rec@@ ognition ? &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s take a fin@@ al example that &apos;s p@@ rom@@ in@@ ent in cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary political deb@@ ate : sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ."
"There are those who fav@@ or state rec@@ ognition only of trad@@ iti@@ onal marri@@ age between one man and one woman , and there are those who fav@@ or state rec@@ ognition of sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ."
How many here fav@@ or the first pol@@ ic@@ y : the state should recogni@@ ze trad@@ iti@@ onal marri@@ age only ?
"And how many fav@@ or the second , sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ?"
"The op@@ pon@@ ents of sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age say that the pur@@ pose of marri@@ age , fundam@@ ent@@ ally , is pro@@ cre@@ ation , and that &apos;s what &apos;s wor@@ thy of hon@@ or@@ ing and recogni@@ zing and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging ."
"So with fl@@ utes , with golf car@@ ts , and even with a f@@ ier@@ c@@ ely cont@@ es@@ ted question like sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age , Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le has a point ."
V@@ ery hard to arg@@ ue about j@@ us@@ tice without first arg@@ u@@ ing about the pur@@ pose of social inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions and about what qu@@ al@@ ities are wor@@ thy of hon@@ or and rec@@ ognition .

"Now look , you &apos;re a pi@@ on@@ e@@ er of op@@ en education ."
Y@@ our lec@@ ture ser@@ ies was one of the first to do it big .
What &apos;s your vision for the next ph@@ ase of this ?
"M@@ S : Well , I think that it is possible ."
"C@@ A : So you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , inv@@ iting questions , but with people from China and India jo@@ in@@ ing in ?"
"M@@ S : R@@ ight . We did a little bit of it here with 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 people in L@@ ong B@@ each , and we do it in a clas@@ s@@ room at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard with about 1@@ ,000 students ."
"W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arg@@ u@@ ing , en@@ gag@@ ing seri@@ ously with big moral questions , expl@@ or@@ ing cul@@ t@@ ural differ@@ ences and con@@ n@@ ect through a live video h@@ o@@ ok@@ up , students in B@@ e@@ ij@@ ing and M@@ umb@@ ai and in C@@ am@@ br@@ id@@ ge , M@@ as@@ sa@@ ch@@ us@@ et@@ ts and create a global clas@@ s@@ room ."
That &apos;s what I would love to do .
"So I work in market@@ ing , which I love , but my first pas@@ sion was physics , a pas@@ sion b@@ rou@@ ght to me by a wonderful school teacher , when I had a little less gra@@ y h@@ air ."
So he t@@ au@@ ght me that physics is co@@ ol because it teach@@ es us so much about the world around us .
So quic@@ k show of h@@ ands — who studi@@ ed some market@@ ing in univer@@ s@@ ity ?
Wh@@ o studi@@ ed some physics in univer@@ s@@ ity ?
P@@ re@@ t@@ ty good . And at school ?
"O@@ kay , lots of you ."
"So , h@@ o@@ pe@@ fully this will bring back some happy , or possi@@ bly some s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es ."
"So , physics and market@@ ing ."
We &apos;ll start with something very simple — Ne@@ w@@ ton &apos;s L@@ a@@ w : &quot; The force equ@@ als mas@@ s times acc@@ el@@ er@@ ation . &quot;
This is something that perhaps T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish A@@ ir@@ l@@ ines should have studi@@ ed a bit more c@@ are@@ fully before they ra@@ n this cam@@ pa@@ ign .
"( Laughter ) But if we re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge this form@@ ul@@ a quickly , we can get to acc@@ el@@ er@@ ation equ@@ als force over mas@@ s , which means that for a larg@@ er partic@@ le — a larg@@ er mas@@ s — it requ@@ ir@@ es more force to change its direc@@ tion ."
"It &apos;s the same with br@@ ands : the more mas@@ sive a brand , the more b@@ ag@@ ga@@ ge it has , the more force is needed to change its pos@@ iti@@ on@@ ing ."
And that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons why Ar@@ th@@ ur A@@ nd@@ er@@ s@@ en ch@@ ose to la@@ un@@ ch A@@ c@@ cent@@ ure rather than try to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the world that A@@ nd@@ er@@ s@@ en &apos;s could st@@ and for something other than ac@@ coun@@ tan@@ cy .
"It expl@@ ains why H@@ o@@ over found it very difficult to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the world that it was more than vac@@ u@@ um c@@ le@@ an@@ ers , and why comp@@ an@@ ies like Un@@ il@@ ever and P &@@ am@@ p@@ ; G keep br@@ ands se@@ par@@ ate , like A@@ ri@@ el and P@@ r@@ ing@@ les and D@@ ove rather than having one gi@@ ant par@@ ent brand ."
"The market@@ ing is , the big@@ ger a brand , the more difficult it is to re@@ position it ."
So think about a por@@ t@@ fol@@ i@@ o of br@@ ands or maybe new br@@ ands for new v@@ ent@@ ures .
"Now , who remem@@ b@@ ers H@@ e@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g &apos;s un@@ cert@@ ain@@ ty princi@@ ple ?"
G@@ etting a little more techn@@ ical now .
"So this says that it &apos;s im@@ possible , by defin@@ ition , to measure exactly the state — i@@ .@@ e@@ . , the position — and the mom@@ ent@@ um of a partic@@ le , because the act of meas@@ uring it , by defin@@ ition , changes it ."
"So to explain that — if you &apos;ve got an el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary partic@@ le and you sh@@ ine a light on it , then the ph@@ ot@@ on of light has mom@@ ent@@ um , which k@@ n@@ oc@@ ks the partic@@ le , so you don &apos;t know where it was before you looked at it ."
"B@@ y meas@@ uring it , the act of meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment changes it ."
The act of observ@@ ation changes it .
It &apos;s the same in market@@ ing .
"So with the act of observ@@ ing cons@@ um@@ ers , changes their behav@@ ior ."
"Th@@ ink about the group of mo@@ ms who are talking about their wonderful children in a f@@ oc@@ us group , and almost n@@ one of them buy lots of j@@ un@@ k f@@ ood ."
"And yet , M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s sel@@ ls hund@@ re@@ ds of mil@@ lions of bur@@ g@@ ers every year ."
"@@ Y@@ et , at Go@@ og@@ le , we know it &apos;s the numb@@ er@@ -@@ one se@@ arch@@ ed for cat@@ eg@@ ory ."
"So l@@ uc@@ k@@ ily , the science — no , sor@@ ry — the market@@ ing is getting eas@@ i@@ er ."
"@@ L@@ uc@@ k@@ ily , with now better poin@@ t@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ sa@@ le trac@@ king , more di@@ g@@ ital med@@ ia cons@@ um@@ p@@ tion , you can measure more what cons@@ um@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they do ."
"So the physics is you can never acc@@ ura@@ t@@ ely and exactly measure a partic@@ le , because the observ@@ ation changes it ."
"The market@@ ing is — the message for market@@ ing is — that try to measure what cons@@ um@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate they &apos;ll do ."
"What this means is you can ga@@ ther more and more data around a hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis or a pos@@ iti@@ on@@ ing , and it will str@@ en@@ g@@ then it , but it will not con@@ cl@@ us@@ iv@@ ely pro@@ ve it ."
And only one con@@ tr@@ ary data point can bl@@ ow your theory out of the water .
So if we take an example — P@@ t@@ ol@@ em@@ y had do@@ z@@ ens of data poin@@ ts to sup@@ port his theory that the planets would ro@@ t@@ ate around the Earth .
It only took one rob@@ ust observ@@ ation from C@@ oper@@ n@@ ic@@ us to bl@@ ow that idea out of the water .
"T@@ ake B@@ P — they sp@@ ent mil@@ lions of p@@ oun@@ ds over many years buil@@ ding up its cre@@ den@@ ti@@ als as an environ@@ m@@ ent@@ ally fri@@ end@@ ly brand , but then one little acc@@ ident ."
Th@@ ink about To@@ y@@ ot@@ a .
"It was , for a long time , re@@ ver@@ ed as the most rel@@ i@@ able of c@@ ars , and then they had the big rec@@ all inc@@ ident ."
"And T@@ ig@@ er W@@ o@@ od@@ s , for a long time , the per@@ fect brand amb@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"Well , you know the story ."
"( Laughter ) So the physics is that you cannot pro@@ ve a hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis , but it &apos;s easy to dis@@ pro@@ ve it — any hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis is sh@@ ak@@ y ."
"And the market@@ ing is that not matter how much you &apos;ve inv@@ es@@ ted in your brand , one bad wee@@ k can under@@ min@@ e dec@@ ad@@ es of good work ."
So be really c@@ are@@ ful to try and av@@ o@@ id the scre@@ w@@ -@@ ups that can under@@ min@@ e your brand .
"And las@@ tly , to the s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly ob@@ sc@@ ure world of entropy — the second la@@ w of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
"This says that entropy , which is a measure of the dis@@ order of a system , will always increase ."
The same is true of market@@ ing .
"If we go back 20 years , the one message pretty much contro@@ l@@ led by one market@@ ing man@@ ag@@ er could pretty much defin@@ e a brand ."
"But where we are today , things have changed ."
You can get a strong brand imag@@ e or a message and put it out there like the Con@@ serv@@ ative P@@ ar@@ ty did ear@@ li@@ er this year with their elec@@ tion pos@@ ter .
But then you l@@ ose contro@@ l of it .
"W@@ it@@ h the kind of di@@ g@@ ital com@@ ment cre@@ ation and dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to@@ ols that are av@@ a@@ il@@ able now to every cons@@ um@@ er , it &apos;s im@@ possible to contro@@ l where it goes ."
"@@ Y@@ our brand star@@ ts being dis@@ per@@ sed , ( Laughter ) it gets more cha@@ ot@@ ic . ( Laughter )"
It &apos;s out of your contro@@ l . ( Laughter )
I actually saw him speak — he did a good job .
"But while this may be un@@ s@@ et@@ t@@ l@@ ing for market@@ ers , it &apos;s actually a good thing ."
"This dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion of brand energy gets your brand cl@@ os@@ er to the people , more in with the people ."
"It makes this dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion of energy a democra@@ ti@@ zing force , which is ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely good for your brand ."
"So , the les@@ son from physics is that entropy will always increase ; it &apos;s a fundam@@ ental la@@ w ."
The message for market@@ ing is that your brand is more dis@@ per@@ sed .
"You can &apos;t fi@@ ght it , so em@@ bra@@ ce it and find a way to work with it ."
Thank you .

"We are going to take a quic@@ k vo@@ y@@ age over the c@@ ogn@@ itive history of the 20@@ th century , because d@@ uring that century , our min@@ ds have al@@ tered dra@@ ma@@ tically ."
"As you all know , the c@@ ars that people drove in 19@@ 00 have al@@ tered because the ro@@ ad@@ s are better and because of technology ."
"And our min@@ ds have al@@ tered , too ."
"Now , this dra@@ ma@@ tic change was dra@@ wn to my att@@ en@@ tion through mas@@ sive I@@ .@@ Q@@ . ga@@ ins over time , and these have been truly mas@@ sive ."
"That is , we don &apos;t just get a few more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . t@@ es@@ ts ."
We get far more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . t@@ es@@ ts than each suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing gener@@ ation back to the time that they were inv@@ ent@@ ed .
"In@@ de@@ ed , if you sc@@ ore the people a century ago against modern nor@@ ms , they would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 70 ."
"If you sc@@ ore us against their nor@@ ms , we would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 1@@ 30 ."
Now this has ra@@ ised all sor@@ ts of questions .
W@@ ere our im@@ medi@@ ate an@@ c@@ est@@ ors on the ver@@ ge of mental re@@ t@@ ar@@ da@@ tion ?
Because 70 is nor@@ m@@ ally the sc@@ ore for mental re@@ t@@ ar@@ da@@ tion .
O@@ r are we on the ver@@ ge of all being gi@@ f@@ ted ?
Because 1@@ 30 is the c@@ ut@@ ting line for gi@@ f@@ t@@ ed@@ ness .
"Now I &apos;m going to try and arg@@ ue for a th@@ ir@@ d al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive that &apos;s much more ill@@ um@@ in@@ ating than e@@ i@@ ther of those , and to put this into per@@ spec@@ tive , let &apos;s imagine that a Mar@@ ti@@ an came down to Earth and found a ru@@ ined civiliz@@ ation ."
"And this Mar@@ ti@@ an was an arch@@ a@@ e@@ olog@@ ist , and they found sc@@ or@@ es , t@@ arg@@ et sc@@ or@@ es , that people had used for sho@@ ot@@ ing ."
"And first they looked at 18@@ 6@@ 5 , and they found that in a min@@ ute , people had only put one b@@ ul@@ let in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e ."
"And then they found , in 18@@ 9@@ 8 , that they &apos;d put about five b@@ ul@@ l@@ ets in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e in a min@@ ute ."
And then about 19@@ 1@@ 8 they put a hundred b@@ ul@@ l@@ ets in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e .
"And in@@ iti@@ ally , that arch@@ a@@ e@@ olog@@ ist would be b@@ af@@ fl@@ ed ."
"They would say , look , these t@@ es@@ ts were des@@ ign@@ ed to find out how much people were ste@@ ad@@ y of hand , how ke@@ en their ey@@ es@@ ight was , whether they had contro@@ l of their we@@ ap@@ on ."
How could these per@@ for@@ man@@ ces have es@@ cal@@ ated to this en@@ or@@ mo@@ us de@@ g@@ ree ?
"Well we now know , of course , the answer ."
"And , in other words , it was the equ@@ ip@@ ment that was in the h@@ ands of the average sol@@ di@@ er that was responsi@@ ble , not gre@@ ater ke@@ en@@ ness of ey@@ e or ste@@ ad@@ iness of hand ."
"Now what we have to imagine is the mental art@@ ill@@ ery that we have pic@@ ked up over those hundred years , and I think again that another thin@@ k@@ er will help us here , and that &apos;s L@@ uria ."
"He found that they were res@@ ist@@ ant to de@@ duc@@ ing the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical , to spec@@ ul@@ ating about what might be , and he found finally that they didn &apos;t de@@ al well with ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tions or using log@@ ic on those ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tions ."
Now let me give you a sam@@ ple of some of his inter@@ vie@@ ws .
He tal@@ ked to the head man of a person in r@@ ural R@@ us@@ s@@ ia .
"They &apos;d only had , as people had in 19@@ 00 , about four years of scho@@ ol@@ ing ."
"And he asked that particular person , what do c@@ ro@@ ws and f@@ ish have in common ?"
"And the f@@ ell@@ ow said , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely nothing ."
"You know , I can e@@ at a f@@ ish . I can &apos;t e@@ at a c@@ row ."
A c@@ row can p@@ ec@@ k at a f@@ ish .
"The other is a bir@@ d . &quot; &quot; And he was interes@@ ted , ef@@ fec@@ ti@@ vely , in what he could do with those con@@ cre@@ te ob@@ jects ."
"And then L@@ uria went to another person , and he said to them , &quot; &quot; There are no cam@@ els in G@@ er@@ many ."
H@@ amb@@ ur@@ g is a c@@ ity in G@@ er@@ many .
"And L@@ uria said , &quot; &quot; But what do my words im@@ ply ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s a small village , and there &apos;s no room for cam@@ els . &quot; &quot; In other words , he was un@@ w@@ ill@@ ing to treat this as anything but a con@@ cre@@ te problem , and he was used to cam@@ els being in vill@@ ages , and he was quite un@@ able to use the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical , to ask h@@ im@@ self what if there were no cam@@ els in G@@ er@@ many ."
"And L@@ uria said , &quot; &quot; A@@ t the N@@ or@@ th P@@ ole , there is always s@@ now ."
"Wh@@ er@@ ever there is always s@@ now , the be@@ ars are wh@@ ite ."
"What col@@ or are the be@@ ars at the N@@ or@@ th P@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; And the respon@@ se was , &quot; &quot; S@@ uch a thing is to be s@@ et@@ t@@ led by t@@ es@@ ti@@ mon@@ y ."
They wer@@ en &apos;t w@@ ill@@ ing to en@@ ga@@ ge in this .
"One of them said to L@@ uria , &quot; &quot; How can we sol@@ ve things that ar@@ en &apos;t real problems ?"
N@@ one of these problems are real .
And let me give you a few ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tions .
"F@@ irst , almost all of us today get a high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a ."
"That is , we &apos;ve g@@ one from four to eight years of education to 12 years of forma@@ l education , and 5@@ 2 percent of Americ@@ ans have actually experienc@@ ed some typ@@ e of ter@@ ti@@ ary education ."
You can &apos;t do science without pro@@ pos@@ ing hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es .
You can &apos;t do science without making it log@@ ically cons@@ ist@@ ent .
"They were things like , what are the cap@@ it@@ als of the 4@@ 4 or 45 states that ex@@ is@@ ted at that time ?"
"When they looked at the exam@@ s that the state of O@@ h@@ i@@ o gave in 19@@ 9@@ 0 , they were all about ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tions ."
"They were things like , why is the larg@@ est c@@ ity of a state r@@ ar@@ ely the cap@@ ital ?"
They put it in H@@ ar@@ ris@@ bur@@ g rather than P@@ h@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ ph@@ ia .
So the t@@ en@@ or of education has changed .
"We are educ@@ ating people to take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical seri@@ ously , to use ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tions , and to l@@ ink them log@@ ically ."
What about em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ ment ?
"Well , in 19@@ 00 , three percent of Americ@@ ans pra@@ c@@ tic@@ ed profes@@ sions that were c@@ ogn@@ it@@ iv@@ ely de@@ man@@ ding ."
O@@ n@@ ly three percent were la@@ w@@ y@@ ers or doc@@ tors or teachers .
"@@ To@@ day , 3@@ 5 percent of Americ@@ ans pra@@ c@@ tice c@@ ogn@@ it@@ iv@@ ely de@@ man@@ ding profes@@ sions , not only to the profes@@ sions pro@@ per like la@@ w@@ y@@ er or doc@@ tor or scient@@ ist or lec@@ tu@@ re@@ r , but many , many sub@@ -@@ profes@@ sions having to do with being a techn@@ ic@@ ian , a computer program@@ m@@ er ."
A whole ran@@ ge of profes@@ sions now make c@@ ogn@@ itive de@@ man@@ ds .
And it &apos;s not just that we have many more people in c@@ ogn@@ it@@ iv@@ ely de@@ man@@ ding profes@@ sions .
The profes@@ sions have been up@@ grad@@ ed .
"C@@ om@@ p@@ are the doc@@ tor in 19@@ 00 , who really had only a few tric@@ ks up his s@@ le@@ eve , with the modern gener@@ al pra@@ c@@ t@@ iti@@ on@@ er or speci@@ al@@ ist , with years of sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic tra@@ in@@ ing ."
They went far be@@ y@@ ond that 19@@ 00 ban@@ k@@ er .
They had to get compl@@ ic@@ ated C@@ D@@ O@@ -@@ squ@@ ar@@ ed in order to b@@ und@@ le d@@ ebt together and make d@@ ebt look as if it were actually a prof@@ it@@ able as@@ set .
O@@ r take a far@@ m@@ er today .
I take the far@@ m man@@ ag@@ er of today as very different from the far@@ m@@ er of 19@@ 00 .
It &apos;s also been the up@@ grad@@ ing of t@@ as@@ ks like la@@ w@@ y@@ er and doc@@ tor and what have you that have made de@@ man@@ ds on our c@@ ogn@@ itive fac@@ ul@@ ties .
But I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about education and em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ ment .
I &apos;m pri@@ mar@@ ily a moral ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ er .
"Now over the last century , in developed na@@ tions like America , moral deb@@ ate has es@@ cal@@ ated because we take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical seri@@ ously , and we also take univer@@ sa@@ ls seri@@ ously and look for log@@ ical connec@@ tions ."
"When I came home in 19@@ 5@@ 5 from univer@@ s@@ ity at the time of Mar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , a lot of people came home at that time and started having arg@@ um@@ ents with their par@@ ents and grand@@ par@@ ents ."
"M@@ y father was born in 18@@ 8@@ 5 , and he was mil@@ d@@ ly ra@@ ci@@ ally bi@@ as@@ ed ."
( Laughter ) But he did have a sense that black people were in@@ fer@@ ior .
"And when we said to our par@@ ents and grand@@ par@@ ents , &quot; How would you feel if to@@ mor@@ row mor@@ ning you wo@@ ke up black ? &quot;"
they said that is the d@@ umb@@ est thing you &apos;ve ever said .
"In other words , they were fi@@ x@@ ed in the con@@ cre@@ te mor@@ es and at@@ tit@@ ud@@ es they had in@@ her@@ ited ."
How would you feel about that ?
"And if someone of the ol@@ der gener@@ ation says , well , our govern@@ ment takes care of us , and it &apos;s up to their govern@@ ment to take care of them , they &apos;re just not w@@ ill@@ ing to take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical seri@@ ously ."
"O@@ r take an I@@ sla@@ mic father wh@@ ose daughter has been ra@@ ped , and he fe@@ els he &apos;s hon@@ or@@ -@@ b@@ ound to k@@ ill her ."
They &apos;re just in@@ her@@ ited mor@@ es .
"@@ To@@ day we would say something like , well , imagine you were k@@ n@@ oc@@ ked un@@ con@@ sci@@ ous and so@@ do@@ miz@@ ed ."
"And he would say , well that &apos;s not in the K@@ or@@ an ."
That &apos;s not one of the princi@@ pl@@ es I &apos;ve got .
"Well you , today , univer@@ sa@@ li@@ ze your princi@@ pl@@ es ."
You state them as ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tions and you use log@@ ic on them .
"You have to say , well , bl@@ ac@@ k@@ ness of sk@@ in , you c@@ ouldn &apos;t suf@@ fer just for that ."
It must be that bl@@ ac@@ ks are some@@ how t@@ ain@@ ted .
"And you can get moral arg@@ ument off the ground , then , because you &apos;re not tre@@ ating moral princi@@ pl@@ es as con@@ cre@@ te ent@@ ities ."
"You &apos;re tre@@ ating them as univer@@ sa@@ ls , to be r@@ end@@ er@@ ed cons@@ ist@@ ent by log@@ ic ."
That &apos;s what in@@ iti@@ ally got me going on c@@ ogn@@ itive history .
"If you look at the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test , you find the ga@@ ins have been gre@@ at@@ est in certain are@@ as ."
There are other parts of the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test b@@ att@@ ery that are about using log@@ ic on ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tions .
"And in 19@@ 00 , people could do simple anal@@ og@@ ies ."
"That is , if you said to them , cat@@ s are like w@@ il@@ d@@ cat@@ s ."
What are do@@ gs like ?
They would say w@@ ol@@ ves .
"But by 19@@ 60 , people could att@@ ack R@@ aven &apos;s on a much more so@@ ph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated level ."
"If you said , we &apos;ve got two squ@@ ar@@ es follo@@ wed by a tri@@ ang@@ le , what follo@@ ws two cir@@ cles ?"
They could say a s@@ em@@ ic@@ ir@@ cle .
"@@ Just as a tri@@ ang@@ le is half of a squ@@ are , a s@@ em@@ ic@@ ir@@ cle is half of a cir@@ cle ."
"B@@ y 20@@ 10 , college grad@@ u@@ ates , if you said two cir@@ cles follo@@ wed by a s@@ em@@ ic@@ ir@@ cle , two si@@ x@@ te@@ ens follo@@ wed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 1@@ 6 ."
"Now , I should say one thing that &apos;s very di@@ she@@ art@@ ening ."
We hav@@ en &apos;t made progress on all fron@@ ts .
"We &apos;ve not@@ ic@@ ed , in a tr@@ end amo@@ n@@ g young Americ@@ ans , that they read less history and less liter@@ ature and less material about for@@ e@@ ign lan@@ ds , and they &apos;re essenti@@ ally a@@ hist@@ or@@ ical ."
They live in the bub@@ ble of the pres@@ ent .
They don &apos;t know the K@@ or@@ e@@ an War from the war in V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am .
They don &apos;t know who was an ally of America in World War I@@ I .
"Th@@ ink how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fi@@ f@@ th time W@@ es@@ tern ar@@ mi@@ es have g@@ one to A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan to put its h@@ ou@@ se in order , and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four pre@@ vi@@ ous occ@@ asi@@ ons ."
"( Laughter ) And that is , they had bar@@ ely left , and there wasn &apos;t a tra@@ ce in the s@@ and ."
O@@ r imagine how different things would be if most Americ@@ ans knew that we had been li@@ ed into four of our last six w@@ ars .
But I don &apos;t want to end on a p@@ es@@ si@@ mis@@ tic not@@ e .
"@@ L@@ or@@ d C@@ ur@@ z@@ on once said he saw people b@@ a@@ thing in the N@@ or@@ th S@@ ea , and he said , &quot; &quot; Why did no one tell me what wh@@ ite bo@@ di@@ es the lower ord@@ ers have ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s if they were a re@@ p@@ t@@ ile ."
"A@@ n imag@@ e is wor@@ th more than a thou@@ s@@ and words , so I &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few imag@@ es that I rec@@ ently cap@@ tu@@ red ."
"So by now , my talk is already 6@@ ,000 words long , and I feel like I should stop here ."
"What I am trying to do as a ph@@ ot@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ er , as an art@@ ist , is to bring the world of art and science together ."
"Wh@@ ether it is an imag@@ e of a so@@ a@@ p bub@@ ble cap@@ tu@@ red at the very moment where it &apos;s bur@@ st@@ ing , as you can see in this imag@@ e , whether it &apos;s a universe made of tiny little be@@ ad@@ s of oil pain@@ t , strange li@@ qu@@ id@@ s that be@@ have in very p@@ ec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar ways , or pain@@ t that is mod@@ el@@ ed by cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ga@@ l for@@ ces , I &apos;m always trying to l@@ ink those two fiel@@ ds together ."
"And yet , they do it in a very different way ."
Let me demon@@ stra@@ te this based on three pro@@ jects .
The first one has to do with making sound vis@@ ible .
"Now as you may know , sound tr@@ av@@ els in w@@ av@@ es , so if you have a speak@@ er , a speak@@ er actually does nothing else than tak@@ ing the audi@@ o sign@@ al , trans@@ form it into a vibra@@ tion , which is then tr@@ an@@ spor@@ ted through the air , is cap@@ tu@@ red by our e@@ ar , and trans@@ form@@ ed into an audi@@ o sign@@ al again ."
"Now I was thinking , how can I make those sound w@@ av@@ es vis@@ ible ?"
So I came up with the follo@@ wing s@@ et@@ up .
"I took a speak@@ er , I plac@@ ed a th@@ in fo@@ il of pl@@ as@@ tic on top of that speak@@ er , and then I ad@@ ded tiny little c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ als on top of that speak@@ er ."
"And now , if I would pl@@ ay a sound through that speak@@ er , it would cause the c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ als to move up and down ."
"Now this happens very fas@@ t , in the bl@@ ink of an ey@@ e , so , together with L@@ G , we cap@@ tu@@ red this mo@@ tion with a c@@ amer@@ a that is able to cap@@ ture more than 3@@ ,000 f@@ rames per second ."
Let me show you what this looks like .
( M@@ us@@ ic : &quot; &quot; T@@ ear@@ drop &quot; &quot; by M@@ as@@ sive A@@ t@@ t@@ ack ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much .
"I ag@@ ree , it looks pretty ama@@ zing ."
But I have to tell you a fun@@ ny story .
I got an indo@@ or s@@ un@@ bur@@ n doing this while sho@@ ot@@ ing in L@@ os A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ es .
"Now in L@@ os A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ es , you could get a de@@ cent s@@ un@@ bur@@ n just on any of the be@@ ach@@ es , but I got min@@ e indo@@ ors , and what happened is that , if you &apos;re sho@@ ot@@ ing at 3@@ ,000 f@@ rames per second , you need to have a sil@@ ly amount of light , lots of li@@ ghts ."
"What was so fun@@ ny about it was that the speak@@ er was only coming from the right side , so the right side of my face was complet@@ ely red and I looked like the P@@ h@@ an@@ tom of the O@@ per@@ a for the rest of the wee@@ k ."
Let me now turn to another project which inv@@ ol@@ ves less har@@ m@@ ful sub@@ stan@@ ces .
H@@ as any@@ one of you heard of fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ?
"A@@ h , some of you have . E@@ x@@ c@@ ell@@ ent ."
S@@ h@@ ould I sk@@ i@@ p that part ?
( Laughter ) F@@ er@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has a very strange behav@@ ior .
It &apos;s a li@@ qu@@ id that is complet@@ ely black .
It &apos;s got an o@@ ily cons@@ ist@@ en@@ cy .
"And it &apos;s got tiny little particles of met@@ al in it , which makes it magnetic ."
"So if I now put this li@@ qu@@ id into a magnetic field , it would change its ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance ."
Now I &apos;ve got a live demon@@ stra@@ tion over here to show this to you .
"So I &apos;ve got a c@@ amer@@ a poin@@ ting down at this pl@@ ate , and under@@ ne@@ ath that pl@@ ate , there is a mag@@ net ."
Now I &apos;m going to ad@@ d some of that fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id to that mag@@ net .
Let &apos;s just s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly move it to the right and maybe f@@ oc@@ us it a little bit more . E@@ x@@ c@@ ell@@ ent .
So what you can see now is that the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has form@@ ed sp@@ ik@@ es .
Th@@ ose are just stan@@ dar@@ d wat@@ er@@ col@@ ors that you would pain@@ t with .
"So what happened now is , when the wat@@ er@@ col@@ or was flo@@ wing into the struc@@ ture , the wat@@ er@@ col@@ ors do not mi@@ x with the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ."
That &apos;s because the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id itself is hy@@ dro@@ ph@@ ob@@ ic .
That means it doesn &apos;t mi@@ x with the water .
So that was the second project .
"Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?"
D@@ id he dr@@ ink half a bot@@ tle of wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey and then dra@@ w the h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ation he got from being dr@@ un@@ k on@@ to p@@ ap@@ er ?
"M@@ aybe you have experienc@@ ed some of those pro@@ per@@ ties before , but I am talking about the physical pro@@ per@@ ties , not the other ones ."
"So when I op@@ en the bot@@ tle , the al@@ co@@ h@@ ol molecul@@ es would sp@@ read in the air , and that &apos;s because al@@ co@@ h@@ ol is a very vol@@ at@@ ile sub@@ st@@ ance ."
"And at the same time , al@@ co@@ h@@ ol is high@@ ly fl@@ am@@ ma@@ ble ."
And it was with those two pro@@ per@@ ties that I was able to create the imag@@ es that you &apos;re see@@ ing right now .
Let me demon@@ stra@@ te this over here .
And what I have here is an emp@@ ty gl@@ as@@ s v@@ es@@ se@@ l .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
And now I &apos;m going to f@@ ill it with oxy@@ g@@ en and wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey .
A@@ d@@ d some more .
Now we just wa@@ it for a few secon@@ ds for the molecul@@ es to sp@@ read inside the bot@@ tle .
"It goes really fas@@ t , and it &apos;s not that im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"So the imag@@ es that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a fl@@ ame st@@ op@@ ped in time while it is tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing through the bot@@ tle , and you have to imagine it was fli@@ pped around 18@@ 0 de@@ gre@@ es ."
So that &apos;s how those imag@@ es were made .
( Applause ) Thank you .
"So , I have now showed you three pro@@ jects , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?"
What &apos;s the idea be@@ h@@ ind it ?
I@@ s it just a was@@ te of wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey ?
"Th@@ ose three pro@@ jects , they &apos;re based on very simple sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic ph@@ enom@@ ena , such as mag@@ n@@ et@@ ism , the sound w@@ av@@ es , or over here , the physical pro@@ per@@ ties of a sub@@ st@@ ance , and what I &apos;m trying to do is I &apos;m trying to use these ph@@ enom@@ ena and show them in a po@@ e@@ tic and un@@ seen way , and ther@@ e@@ fore inv@@ ite the vie@@ wer to p@@ ause for a moment and think about all the be@@ a@@ ut@@ y that is con@@ stan@@ tly sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing us ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"O@@ n@@ ce up@@ on a time , at the age of 2@@ 4 , I was a stud@@ ent at St@@ . Jo@@ h@@ n &apos;s M@@ ed@@ ical C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in B@@ an@@ gal@@ ore ."
I was a gu@@ est stud@@ ent d@@ uring one mon@@ th of a publi@@ c health course .
And that changed my min@@ d@@ set forever .
"The course was good , but it was not the course cont@@ ent in itself that changed the min@@ d@@ set ."
"It was the br@@ ut@@ al realiz@@ ation , the first mor@@ ning , that the In@@ dian students were better than me ."
"( Laughter ) You see , I was a study ner@@ d ."
I lov@@ ed stat@@ is@@ tics from a young age .
And I studi@@ ed very much in Swed@@ en .
I used to be in the up@@ per qu@@ ar@@ ter of all cour@@ ses I att@@ end@@ ed .
"But in St@@ . Jo@@ h@@ n &apos;s , I was in the lower qu@@ ar@@ ter ."
And the fact was that In@@ dian students studi@@ ed har@@ der than we did in Swed@@ en .
"They read the t@@ ext@@ bo@@ ok tw@@ ice , or three times or four times ."
In Swed@@ en we read it once and then we went par@@ t@@ ying .
"( Lau@@ gh@@ er ) And that , to me , that per@@ s@@ onal experience was the first time in my life that the min@@ d@@ set I gre@@ w up with was changed ."
And I realiz@@ ed that perhaps the W@@ es@@ tern world will not contin@@ ue to domin@@ ate the world forever .
And I think many of you have the same sort of per@@ s@@ onal experience .
It &apos;s that realiz@@ ation of someone you me@@ et that really made you change your ideas about the world .
"It &apos;s not the stat@@ is@@ tics , al@@ though I tried to make it fun@@ ny ."
"And I will now , here , on@@ st@@ age , try to predic@@ t when that will happen — that A@@ s@@ ia will re@@ ga@@ in its domin@@ ant position as the lead@@ ing part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years ."
"And I will do that by trying to predic@@ t prec@@ is@@ ely at what year the average income per person in India , in China , will re@@ ach that of the W@@ est ."
"And I don &apos;t mean the whole econom@@ y , because to grow an econom@@ y of India to the si@@ ze of U.@@ K@@ . — that &apos;s a piece of c@@ ake , with one billion people ."
"But I want to see when will the average pa@@ y , the money for each person , per mon@@ th , in India and China , when will that have re@@ ach@@ ed that of U.@@ K@@ . and the United States ?"
But I will start with a hist@@ or@@ ical bac@@ k@@ ground .
And you can see my ma@@ p if I get it up here . You know ?
I will start at 1858 .
1858 was a year of great techn@@ ological adv@@ an@@ c@@ ement in the W@@ est .
"That was the year when Q@@ u@@ e@@ en V@@ ic@@ t@@ oria was able , for the first time , to commun@@ ic@@ ate with P@@ res@@ ident B@@ u@@ chan@@ an , through the T@@ ran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Tel@@ e@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic C@@ able ."
And they were the first to &quot; &quot; T@@ wit@@ ter &quot; &quot; tr@@ an@@ sat@@ lan@@ tically .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;ve been able , through this wonderful Go@@ og@@ le and Inter@@ net , to find the t@@ ex@@ t of the t@@ el@@ eg@@ ram s@@ ent back from P@@ res@@ ident B@@ u@@ chan@@ an to Q@@ u@@ e@@ en V@@ ic@@ t@@ oria ."
"And it ends like this : &quot; &quot; This t@@ el@@ e@@ graph is a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic in@@ str@@ ument to dif@@ f@@ use relig@@ ion , civiliz@@ ation , li@@ b@@ erty and la@@ w throu@@ gh@@ out the world . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose are n@@ ice words . But I got sort of cur@@ i@@ ous of what he me@@ ant with li@@ b@@ erty , and li@@ b@@ erty for wh@@ om ."
And we will think about that when we look at the w@@ ider picture of the world in 1858 .
Because 1858 was also wat@@ er@@ shed year in the history of A@@ s@@ ia .
1858 was the year when the cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous up@@ ris@@ ing against the for@@ e@@ ign occ@@ up@@ ation of India was de@@ fe@@ ated by the Brit@@ ish for@@ ces .
And India was up to 8@@ 9 years more of for@@ e@@ ign domin@@ ation .
1858 in China was the vic@@ t@@ ory in the O@@ pi@@ um War by the Brit@@ ish for@@ ces .
"And that me@@ ant that for@@ e@@ ign@@ ers , as it said in the treat@@ y , were allowed to tra@@ de fre@@ ely in China ."
It me@@ ant pa@@ ying with o@@ pi@@ um for Ch@@ in@@ ese go@@ od@@ s .
And 1858 in Japan was the year when Japan had to sig@@ n the H@@ ar@@ ris T@@ re@@ at@@ y and ac@@ cept tra@@ de on fav@@ or@@ able con@@ d@@ ition for the U.S.
"And they were thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by those black shi@@ ps there , that had been in To@@ k@@ y@@ o har@@ b@@ or over the last year ."
"But , Japan , in con@@ tra@@ st to India and China , ma@@ int@@ ained its national s@@ over@@ e@@ ign@@ ty ."
And let &apos;s see how much difference that can make .
"And I will do that by br@@ ing@@ ing these bub@@ bl@@ es back to a G@@ ap@@ min@@ der graph here , where you can see each bub@@ ble is a country ."
The si@@ ze of the bub@@ ble here is the population .
"O@@ n this ax@@ is , as I used to have income per person in com@@ par@@ able doll@@ ar ."
"And on that ax@@ is I have life expec@@ tan@@ cy , the health of people ."
And I also bring an in@@ nov@@ ation here .
"I have trans@@ form@@ ed the las@@ er be@@ am into an ec@@ ological , rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able ver@@ sion here , in gre@@ en India ."
"( Applause ) And we will see , you know ."
"@@ L@@ ook here , 1858 , India was here , China was here , Japan was there , United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom was ri@@ ch@@ er over there ."
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
"A@@ c@@ tually if we go back into the hist@@ or@@ ical rec@@ or@@ d , there was a time hund@@ re@@ ds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even ab@@ ove that of Eu@@ rop@@ e ."
"But 18@@ 50 had already been many , many years of for@@ e@@ ign domin@@ ation , and India had been de@@ -@@ ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ aliz@@ ed ."
And you can see that the countries who were gro@@ wing their econom@@ y was United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom .
"And they were also , by the end of the century , getting heal@@ thy , and Japan was star@@ ting to cat@@ ch up ."
India was trying down here .
Can you see how it star@@ ts to move there ?
"But really , really natural s@@ over@@ e@@ ign@@ ty was good for Japan ."
And Japan is trying to move up there .
"And it &apos;s the new century now . H@@ e@@ al@@ th is getting better , United K@@ ing@@ dom , United States ."
But c@@ are@@ ful now — we are appro@@ ach@@ ing the F@@ irst World War .
"And the F@@ irst World War , you know , we &apos;ll see a lot of de@@ a@@ ths and econom@@ ical problems here ."
United K@@ ing@@ dom is going down .
And now comes the S@@ pan@@ ish fl@@ u also .
"And then after the F@@ irst World War , they contin@@ ue up ."
"S@@ t@@ ill under for@@ e@@ ign domin@@ ation , and without s@@ over@@ e@@ ign@@ ty , India and China are down in the cor@@ ner ."
Not much has happened .
They have gro@@ wn their population but not much more .
"In the 19@@ 30 &apos;s now , you can see that Japan is going to a peri@@ od of war , with lower life expec@@ tan@@ cy ."
"And the S@@ econ@@ d World War was really a ter@@ ri@@ ble ev@@ ent , also econom@@ ically for Japan ."
But they did rec@@ over quite fas@@ t af@@ ter@@ wards .
And we are mov@@ ing into the new world .
In 19@@ 4@@ 7 India finally ga@@ ined its inde@@ pen@@ den@@ ce .
"And they could ra@@ ise the In@@ dian fl@@ a@@ g and become a s@@ over@@ e@@ ign na@@ tion , but in very big diffic@@ ul@@ ties down there ."
( Applause ) In 19@@ 4@@ 9 we saw the emer@@ g@@ ence of the modern China in a way which sur@@ pris@@ ed the world .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after inde@@ pen@@ den@@ ce ?
You can see that the health started to impro@@ ve .
Ch@@ il@@ dren started to go to school .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th ser@@ vic@@ es were pro@@ vid@@ ed .
"This is the G@@ re@@ at Le@@ a@@ p F@@ or@@ ward , when China f@@ ell down ."
It was cent@@ ral plan@@ ning by M@@ a@@ o T@@ se T@@ un@@ g .
"@@ China rec@@ over@@ ed . Th@@ en they said , &quot; N@@ ever@@ more , st@@ up@@ id cent@@ ral plan@@ ning . &quot;"
"But they went up here , and India was trying to fol@@ low ."
And they were cat@@ ch@@ ing up inde@@ ed .
"And both countries had the better health , but still a very low econom@@ y ."
"And we came to 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and M@@ a@@ o T@@ se T@@ un@@ g di@@ ed , and a new guy turned up from the left ."
And it was D@@ en@@ g X@@ i@@ a@@ op@@ ing coming out here .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t matter if a c@@ at is wh@@ ite or black , as long as it cat@@ ch@@ es m@@ ice . &quot; &quot; Because cat@@ ch@@ ing m@@ ice is what the two cat@@ s wanted to do ."
"And you can see the two cat@@ s being here , China and India , wan@@ ting to cat@@ ch the mic@@ es over there , you know ."
"And they decided to go not only for health and education , but also star@@ ting to grow their econom@@ y ."
And the mark@@ et re@@ form@@ er was successful there .
In &apos; 9@@ 2 India follo@@ ws with a mark@@ et re@@ form .
"And they go quite cl@@ os@@ ely together , and you can see that the si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ity with India and China , in many ways , are gre@@ ater than the differ@@ ences with them ."
And here they mar@@ ch on . And will they cat@@ ch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Now what does it mean that the — ( Applause ) the aver@@ ages there — this is the average of China .
"If I would s@@ pl@@ it China , look here , S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai has already cat@@ ched up ."
S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai is already there .
And it &apos;s heal@@ th@@ i@@ er than the United States .
"But on the other hand , G@@ u@@ izh@@ ou , one of the poor@@ est in@@ l@@ and pro@@ vin@@ ces of China , is there ."
"And if I s@@ pl@@ it G@@ u@@ izh@@ ou into ur@@ b@@ an and r@@ ural , the r@@ ural part of G@@ u@@ izh@@ ou goes down there ."
"You see this en@@ or@@ mo@@ us inequ@@ ity in China , in the mid@@ st of fas@@ t economic growth ."
"And if I would also look at India , you have another typ@@ e of inequ@@ ity , actually , in India ."
"The ge@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ ical , ma@@ c@@ ro@@ -@@ ge@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ ical difference is not so big ."
"@@ U@@ t@@ t@@ ar P@@ rad@@ esh , the big@@ gest of the states here , is poor@@ er and has a lower health than the rest of India ."
"@@ K@@ er@@ ala is fl@@ ying on top there , mat@@ ch@@ ing United States in health , but not in econom@@ y ."
"And here , M@@ a@@ har@@ ash@@ t@@ ra , with M@@ umb@@ ai , is for@@ ging for@@ ward ."
"Now in India , the big inequ@@ ities are within the state , rather than between the states ."
"And that is not a bad thing , in itself ."
"If you have a lot inequ@@ ity , ma@@ c@@ ro@@ -@@ ge@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ ical inequ@@ ities can be more difficult in the long ter@@ m to de@@ al with , than if it is in the same are@@ a where you have a growth center relati@@ vely cl@@ ose to where poor people are liv@@ ing ."
"@@ No , there is one more inequ@@ ity . L@@ ook there , United States ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , they bro@@ ke my fra@@ me ."
"W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . went out here ."
M@@ y friends at G@@ ap@@ min@@ der wanted me to show this because there is a new lead@@ er in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton who is really con@@ c@@ er@@ ned about the health system .
"And I can understand him , because W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ ."
is so rich over there but they are not as heal@@ thy as K@@ er@@ ala .
"It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?"
"( Applause ) I can see a b@@ usiness op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity for K@@ er@@ ala , hel@@ ping fi@@ x the health system in the United States ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now here we have the whole world . You have the le@@ g@@ end down there .
"And when you see the two gi@@ ant cat@@ s here , p@@ ush@@ ing for@@ ward , you see that in between them and a@@ head of them , is the whole emer@@ ging economi@@ es of the world , which Th@@ o@@ mas F@@ ri@@ ed@@ man so cor@@ rec@@ tly called the &quot; &quot; fl@@ at world . &quot; &quot; You can see that in health and education , a large part of the world population is p@@ ut@@ ting for@@ ward , but in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , and other parts , as in r@@ ural G@@ u@@ izh@@ ou in China , there is still people with low health and very low econom@@ y ."
We have an en@@ or@@ mo@@ us dis@@ par@@ ity in the world .
But most of the world in the middle are p@@ ush@@ ing for@@ wards very fas@@ t .
"Now , back to my pro@@ jec@@ tions ."
Wh@@ en will it cat@@ ch up ? I have to go back to very con@@ ven@@ tional graph .
"I will show income per person on this ax@@ is instead , poor down here , rich up there ."
"And then time here , from 1858 I start the world ."
And we sh@@ all see what will happen with these countries .
"You see , China under for@@ e@@ ign domin@@ ation actually lo@@ wer@@ ed their income and came down to the In@@ dian level here ."
Wh@@ ere@@ as U.@@ K@@ . and United States is getting ri@@ ch@@ er and ri@@ ch@@ er .
"And after S@@ econ@@ d World War , United States is ri@@ ch@@ er than U.@@ K@@ ."
But inde@@ pen@@ den@@ ce is coming here .
"@@ G@@ ro@@ wth is star@@ ting , economic re@@ form ."
"@@ G@@ ro@@ wth is fas@@ ter , and with pro@@ jec@@ tion from I@@ M@@ F you can see where you exp@@ ect them to be in 20@@ 14 ."
"Now , the question is , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en will the cat@@ ch up take place ? &quot; &quot; L@@ ook at , look at the United States ."
Can you see the bub@@ ble ?
"The bub@@ bl@@ es , not my bub@@ bl@@ es , but the fin@@ an@@ cial bub@@ bl@@ es ."
That &apos;s the d@@ ot co@@ m bub@@ ble . This is the Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers do@@ or@@ ste@@ p there .
You see it came down there .
"And it seems this is another ro@@ c@@ k coming down there , you know ."
"So they doesn &apos;t seem to go this way , these countries ."
"They seem to go in a more hum@@ ble growth way , you know ."
And people interes@@ ted in growth are turn@@ ing their ey@@ es to@@ wards A@@ s@@ ia .
I can comp@@ are to Japan . This is Japan coming up .
"You see , Japan did it like that ."
We ad@@ d Japan to it .
And there is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that fas@@ t cat@@ ch up can take place .
Can you see here what Japan did ?
"@@ Japan did it like this , until ful@@ l cat@@ ch up , and then they fol@@ low with the other high@@ -@@ income economi@@ es ."
"But the real pro@@ jec@@ tions for those ones , I would like to give it like this ."
"C@@ an be worse , can be better ."
"It &apos;s always difficult to predic@@ t , es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally about the future ."
"Now , a hist@@ or@@ ian t@@ ells me it &apos;s even more difficult to predic@@ t about the past ."
( Laughter ) I think I &apos;m in a difficult position here .
"I@@ ne@@ qu@@ al@@ ities in China and India I cons@@ ider really the big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le because to bring the enti@@ re population into growth and pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity is what will create a domestic mark@@ et , what will av@@ o@@ id social inst@@ abil@@ ity , and which will make use of the enti@@ re cap@@ ac@@ ity of the population ."
"So , social inv@@ est@@ ments in health , education and in@@ fra@@ struc@@ ture , and elec@@ tric@@ ity is really what is needed in India and China ."
"You know the cli@@ mate . We have great inter@@ national exp@@ ert@@ s within India telling us that the cli@@ mate is chang@@ ing , and ac@@ tions has to be taken , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise China and India would be the countries most to suf@@ fer from cli@@ mate change ."
And I cons@@ ider India and China the best par@@ t@@ n@@ ers in the world in a good global cli@@ mate pol@@ ic@@ y .
"But they ain &apos;t going to pa@@ y for what others , who have more money , have larg@@ ely created , and I can ag@@ ree on that ."
But what I &apos;m really wor@@ ri@@ ed about is war .
"W@@ ill the form@@ er rich countries really ac@@ cept a complet@@ ely changed world econom@@ y , and a shi@@ ft of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years , back to A@@ s@@ ia ?"
"And will A@@ s@@ ia be able to h@@ and@@ le that new position of being in ch@@ arg@@ e of being the most migh@@ ty , and the govern@@ ors of the world ?"
"So , always av@@ o@@ id war , because that always p@@ ush@@ es human be@@ ings bac@@ k@@ ward ."
"Now if these inequ@@ al@@ ities , cli@@ mate and war can be av@@ o@@ id@@ ed , get ready for a world in equ@@ ity , because this is what seems to be happening ."
"And that vision that I got as a young stud@@ ent , 19@@ 7@@ 2 , that In@@ di@@ ans can be much better than Swed@@ es , is just about to happen ."
"And it will happen prec@@ is@@ ely the year 20@@ 4@@ 8 in the later part of the s@@ um@@ m@@ er , in J@@ uly , more prec@@ is@@ ely , the 2@@ 7@@ th of J@@ uly ."
"( Applause ) The 2@@ 7@@ th of J@@ uly , 20@@ 4@@ 8 is my 10@@ 0@@ th bir@@ th@@ day ."
( Laughter ) And I exp@@ ect to speak in the first s@@ es@@ sion of the 3@@ 9@@ th TE@@ D India .
G@@ et your bo@@ ok@@ ings in time . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"H@@ i . So , this cha@@ p here , he thin@@ ks he can tell you the future ."
"H@@ is na@@ me is N@@ os@@ tra@@ dam@@ us , al@@ though here the Sun have made him look a little bit like S@@ e@@ an Con@@ n@@ ery . ( Laughter ) And like most of you , I sus@@ p@@ ect , I don &apos;t really believe that people can see into the future ."
"I don &apos;t believe in prec@@ ognition , and every now and then , you hear that somebody has been able to predic@@ t something that happened in the future , and that &apos;s probably because it was a flu@@ ke , and we only hear about the fl@@ uk@@ es and about the fre@@ ak@@ s ."
We don &apos;t hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong .
"Now we exp@@ ect that to happen with sil@@ ly stories about prec@@ ognition , but the problem is , we have exactly the same problem in ac@@ ade@@ mi@@ a and in medicine , and in this environ@@ ment , it c@@ os@@ ts lives ."
"So fir@@ st@@ ly , thinking just about prec@@ ognition , as it turns out , just last year a rese@@ arch@@ er called D@@ ar@@ y@@ l B@@ em conduc@@ ted a piece of research where he found evidence of prec@@ ogn@@ itive po@@ w@@ ers in under@@ grad@@ u@@ ate students , and this was published in a pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ ade@@ mic jour@@ n@@ al and most of the people who read this just said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , well , fa@@ ir enough , but I think that &apos;s a flu@@ ke , that &apos;s a fre@@ ak , because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that under@@ grad@@ u@@ ate students had prec@@ ogn@@ itive po@@ w@@ ers , it probably wouldn &apos;t get published in a jour@@ n@@ al ."
"And in fact , we know that that &apos;s true , because s@@ ever@@ al different groups of research scient@@ ists tried to re@@ plic@@ ate the fin@@ d@@ ings of this prec@@ ognition study , and when they sub@@ mit@@ ted it to the ex@@ act same jour@@ n@@ al , the jour@@ n@@ al said , &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;re not interes@@ ted in publi@@ sh@@ ing re@@ plic@@ ation . We &apos;re not interes@@ ted in your nega@@ tive data . &quot; &quot; So this is already evidence of how , in the ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature , we will see a bi@@ as@@ ed sam@@ ple of the true picture of all of the sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic studies that have been conduc@@ ted ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the dr@@ y ac@@ ade@@ mic field of psych@@ ology .
"It also happens in , for example , can@@ cer research ."
"So in Mar@@ ch , 20@@ 12 , just one mon@@ th ago , some rese@@ arch@@ ers re@@ por@@ ted in the jour@@ n@@ al N@@ ature how they had tried to re@@ plic@@ ate 5@@ 3 different bas@@ ic science studies looking at p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al treat@@ ment t@@ arg@@ ets in can@@ cer , and out of those 5@@ 3 studies , they were only able to success@@ fully re@@ plic@@ ate six ."
F@@ or@@ t@@ y-@@ seven out of those 5@@ 3 were un@@ re@@ plic@@ able .
And they say in their disc@@ us@@ sion that this is very lik@@ ely because fre@@ ak@@ s get published .
"@@ People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies , and the occ@@ asi@@ ons when it works they will publ@@ ish , and the ones where it doesn &apos;t work they won &apos;t ."
"And their first re@@ com@@ men@@ da@@ tion of how to fi@@ x this problem , because it is a problem , because it sen@@ ds us all down bl@@ ind al@@ le@@ ys , their first re@@ com@@ men@@ da@@ tion of how to fi@@ x this problem is to make it eas@@ i@@ er to publ@@ ish nega@@ tive results in science , and to change the inc@@ enti@@ ves so that scient@@ ists are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to pos@@ t more of their nega@@ tive results in publi@@ c ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the very dr@@ y world of pre@@ cl@@ in@@ ical bas@@ ic science can@@ cer research .
"It also happens in the very real , fl@@ esh and blo@@ od of ac@@ ade@@ mic medicine . So in 198@@ 0 , some rese@@ arch@@ ers did a study on a dru@@ g called l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ ide , and this was an an@@ ti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic dru@@ g , a dru@@ g that sup@@ pres@@ ses ab@@ nor@@ mal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , and the idea was , after people have had a heart att@@ ack , they &apos;re quite lik@@ ely to have ab@@ nor@@ mal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , so if we give them a dru@@ g that sup@@ pres@@ ses ab@@ nor@@ mal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , this will increase the chan@@ ces of them surviv@@ ing ."
"@@ Ear@@ ly on its develop@@ ment , they did a very small tri@@ al , just under a hundred patients ."
"F@@ if@@ ty patients got l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ ide , and of those patients , 10 di@@ ed ."
"A@@ n@@ other 50 patients got a d@@ um@@ my plac@@ ebo su@@ ga@@ r p@@ ill with no ac@@ tive ing@@ re@@ di@@ ent , and only one of them di@@ ed ."
"So they ri@@ gh@@ tly re@@ gar@@ ded this dru@@ g as a fail@@ ure , and its com@@ mer@@ cial develop@@ ment was st@@ op@@ ped , and because its com@@ mer@@ cial develop@@ ment was st@@ op@@ ped , this tri@@ al was never published ."
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , over the course of the next five , 10 years , other comp@@ an@@ ies had the same idea about dru@@ gs that would pre@@ v@@ ent ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ as in people who have had heart att@@ ac@@ ks ."
"Th@@ ese dru@@ gs were b@@ rou@@ ght to mark@@ et . They were pres@@ cri@@ b@@ ed very w@@ id@@ ely because heart att@@ ac@@ ks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these dru@@ gs also c@@ a@@ used an increas@@ ed ra@@ te of de@@ ath that before we det@@ ec@@ ted that saf@@ ety sign@@ al , over 10@@ 0,000 people di@@ ed un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily in America from the pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion of an@@ ti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic dru@@ gs ."
"Now actually , in 19@@ 9@@ 3 , the rese@@ arch@@ ers who did that 198@@ 0 study , that early study , published a me@@ a cul@@ p@@ a , an ap@@ ology to the sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic commun@@ ity , in which they said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en we car@@ ri@@ ed out our study in 198@@ 0 , we thought that the increas@@ ed de@@ ath ra@@ te that oc@@ cur@@ red in the l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ ide group was an ef@@ fect of chan@@ ce . &quot; &quot; The develop@@ ment of l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ ide was ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed for com@@ mer@@ cial reas@@ ons , and this study was never published ; it &apos;s now a good example of publ@@ ic@@ ation bi@@ as ."
"That &apos;s the techn@@ ical ter@@ m for the ph@@ enom@@ en@@ on where un@@ fl@@ at@@ ter@@ ing data gets lost , gets un@@ published , is left mis@@ sing in action , and they say the results describ@@ ed here &quot; might have pro@@ vid@@ ed an early war@@ ning of tro@@ ub@@ le a@@ head . &quot;"
Now these are stories from bas@@ ic science .
"Th@@ ese are stories from 20 , 30 years ago ."
The ac@@ ade@@ mic publi@@ sh@@ ing environ@@ ment is very different now .
"There are ac@@ ade@@ mic jour@@ n@@ als like &quot; &quot; T@@ ri@@ als , &quot; &quot; the op@@ en acc@@ ess jour@@ n@@ al , which will publ@@ ish any tri@@ al conduc@@ ted in hum@@ ans re@@ gar@@ dl@@ ess of whether it has a positive or a nega@@ tive res@@ ult ."
But this problem of nega@@ tive results that go mis@@ sing in action is still very pre@@ val@@ ent . In fact it &apos;s so pre@@ val@@ ent that it c@@ ut@@ s to the cor@@ e of ev@@ id@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ based medicine .
"So this is a dru@@ g called reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , and this is a dru@@ g that I myself have pres@@ cri@@ b@@ ed . It &apos;s an an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant ."
"And I &apos;m a very ner@@ d@@ y doc@@ tor , so I read all of the studies that I could on this dru@@ g . I read the one study that was published that showed that reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine was better than plac@@ ebo , and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine was just as good as any other an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant , and because this pati@@ ent h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t done well on those other an@@ ti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts , I thought , well , reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine is just as good . It &apos;s one to try ."
"But it turned out that I was mis@@ led . In fact , seven trials were conduc@@ ted com@@ par@@ ing reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine against a d@@ um@@ my plac@@ ebo su@@ ga@@ r p@@ ill . One of them was positive and that was published , but six of them were nega@@ tive and they were left un@@ published ."
"Th@@ ree trials were published com@@ par@@ ing reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine against other an@@ ti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts in which reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine was just as good , and they were published , but three times as many patients &apos; wor@@ th of data was col@@ lec@@ ted which showed that reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine was worse than those other treat@@ ments , and those trials were not published ."
I f@@ el@@ t mis@@ led .
"Now you might say , well , that &apos;s an extre@@ m@@ ely un@@ us@@ ual example , and I wouldn &apos;t want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of the same kind of cher@@ r@@ y-@@ pic@@ king and sel@@ ec@@ tive re@@ fer@@ enc@@ ing that I &apos;m acc@@ using other people of ."
"But it turns out that this ph@@ enom@@ en@@ on of publ@@ ic@@ ation bi@@ as has actually been very , very well studi@@ ed ."
So here is one example of how you approach it .
"The clas@@ si@@ c mo@@ de@@ l is , you get a bun@@ ch of studies where you know that they &apos;ve been conduc@@ ted and complet@@ ed , and then you go and see if they &apos;ve been published any@@ where in the ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature . So this took all of the trials that had ever been conduc@@ ted on an@@ ti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts that were appro@@ ved over a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ year peri@@ od by the F@@ D@@ A ."
They took all of the trials which were sub@@ mit@@ ted to the F@@ D@@ A as part of the appro@@ v@@ al p@@ ac@@ k@@ age .
"So that &apos;s not all of the trials that were ever conduc@@ ted on these dru@@ gs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conduc@@ ted in order to get the market@@ ing au@@ th@@ or@@ iz@@ ation ."
And then they went to see if these trials had been published in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature . And this is what they found .
"It was pretty much a 5@@ 0-@@ 50 s@@ pl@@ it . H@@ al@@ f of these trials were positive , half of them were nega@@ tive , in reality ."
"But when they went to look for these trials in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature , what they found was a very different picture ."
"O@@ n@@ ly three of the nega@@ tive trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published ."
"Now if we just fl@@ ic@@ k back and for@@ th between those two , you can see what a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing difference there was between reality and what doc@@ tors , patients , com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ers of health ser@@ vic@@ es , and ac@@ ade@@ m@@ ics were able to see in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature ."
"We were mis@@ led , and this is a sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic fl@@ a@@ w in the cor@@ e of medicine ."
"In fact , there have been so many studies conduc@@ ted on publ@@ ic@@ ation bi@@ as now , over a hundred , that they &apos;ve been col@@ lec@@ ted in a sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic re@@ view , published in 20@@ 10 , that took every single study on publ@@ ic@@ ation bi@@ as that they could find ."
P@@ ub@@ l@@ ic@@ ation bi@@ as af@@ fec@@ ts every field of medicine .
"A@@ b@@ out half of all trials , on average , go mis@@ sing in action , and we know that positive fin@@ d@@ ings are around tw@@ ice as lik@@ ely to be published as nega@@ tive fin@@ d@@ ings ."
This is a can@@ cer at the cor@@ e of ev@@ id@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ based medicine .
"If I fli@@ pped a co@@ in 100 times but then with@@ hel@@ d the results from you from half of those t@@ os@@ ses , I could make it look as if I had a co@@ in that always came up he@@ ad@@ s ."
But that wouldn &apos;t mean that I had a tw@@ o-@@ he@@ ad@@ ed co@@ in .
That would mean that I was a chan@@ cer and you were an id@@ iot for l@@ etting me get away with it . ( Laughter ) But this is exactly what we bl@@ ind@@ ly t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate in the whole of ev@@ id@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ based medicine .
"And to me , this is research mis@@ conduc@@ t ."
"If I conduc@@ ted one study and I with@@ hel@@ d half of the data poin@@ ts from that one study , you would ri@@ gh@@ tly acc@@ use me , essenti@@ ally , of research fra@@ u@@ d ."
"And yet , for some reason , if somebody conduc@@ ts 10 studies but only publi@@ sh@@ es the five that give the res@@ ult that they want , we don &apos;t cons@@ ider that to be research mis@@ conduc@@ t ."
"And when that responsi@@ bil@@ ity is dif@@ f@@ used between a whole n@@ et@@ work of rese@@ arch@@ ers , ac@@ ade@@ m@@ ics , ind@@ u@@ str@@ y spon@@ s@@ ors , jour@@ n@@ al ed@@ it@@ ors , for some reason we find it more ac@@ cep@@ table , but the ef@@ fect on patients is dam@@ ning ."
"And this is happening right now , today ."
"This is a dru@@ g called T@@ ami@@ fl@@ u . T@@ ami@@ fl@@ u is a dru@@ g which govern@@ ments around the world have sp@@ ent bil@@ lions and bil@@ lions of dollars on st@@ oc@@ k@@ p@@ il@@ ing , and we &apos;ve st@@ oc@@ k@@ p@@ il@@ ed T@@ ami@@ fl@@ u in pan@@ ic , in the beli@@ ef that it will re@@ duc@@ e the ra@@ te of compl@@ ic@@ ations of in@@ flu@@ en@@ z@@ a ."
"C@@ om@@ plic@@ ations is a med@@ ical e@@ u@@ ph@@ em@@ ism for p@@ neu@@ mon@@ ia and de@@ ath . ( Laughter ) Now when the C@@ o@@ ch@@ ran@@ e sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic re@@ vie@@ w@@ ers were trying to col@@ l@@ ect together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been conduc@@ ted on whether T@@ ami@@ fl@@ u actually did this or not , they found that s@@ ever@@ al of those trials were un@@ published ."
The results were un@@ av@@ a@@ il@@ able to them .
"And when they started ob@@ t@@ ain@@ ing the writ@@ e@@ ups of those trials through vari@@ ous different means , through F@@ re@@ ed@@ om of In@@ forma@@ tion A@@ c@@ t re@@ ques@@ ts , through h@@ aras@@ sing vari@@ ous different organiz@@ ations , what they found was in@@ cons@@ ist@@ ent ."
"And when they tried to get a hold of the cl@@ in@@ ical study re@@ por@@ ts , the 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ p@@ age long doc@@ um@@ ents that have the best possible r@@ end@@ ition of the information , they were told they wer@@ en &apos;t allowed to have them ."
"And if you want to read the ful@@ l cor@@ respon@@ den@@ ce and the exc@@ us@@ es and the ex@@ plan@@ ations giv@@ en by the dru@@ g comp@@ any , you can see that writ@@ ten up in this wee@@ k &apos;s ed@@ ition of P@@ L@@ O@@ S M@@ ed@@ ic@@ ine ."
"And the most st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recogni@@ ze that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suf@@ fer f@@ ake fi@@ x@@ es ."
We &apos;ve had people pret@@ end that this is a problem that &apos;s been fi@@ x@@ ed .
"F@@ irst of all , we had trials re@@ g@@ ist@@ ers , and everybody said , o@@ h , it &apos;s ok@@ ay . We &apos;ll get everyone to re@@ g@@ is@@ ter their trials , they &apos;ll pos@@ t the pro@@ to@@ co@@ l , they &apos;ll say what they &apos;re going to do before they do it , and then af@@ ter@@ wards we &apos;ll be able to ch@@ ec@@ k and see if all the trials which have been conduc@@ ted and complet@@ ed have been published ."
But people didn &apos;t b@@ other to use those re@@ g@@ ist@@ ers .
"And so then the Inter@@ national C@@ om@@ mit@@ te@@ e of M@@ ed@@ ical J@@ our@@ n@@ al E@@ d@@ it@@ ors came along , and they said , o@@ h , well , we will hold the line ."
"We won &apos;t publ@@ ish any jour@@ n@@ als , we won &apos;t publ@@ ish any trials , un@@ less they &apos;ve been re@@ g@@ is@@ tered before they be@@ gan ."
"But they didn &apos;t hold the line . In 200@@ 8 , a study was conduc@@ ted which showed that half of all of trials published by jour@@ n@@ als ed@@ ited by mem@@ b@@ ers of the I@@ C@@ M@@ J@@ E wer@@ en &apos;t pro@@ per@@ ly re@@ g@@ is@@ tered , and a qu@@ ar@@ ter of them wer@@ en &apos;t re@@ g@@ is@@ tered at all ."
"And then finally , the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ c@@ t was pas@@ sed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conduc@@ ts a tri@@ al must pos@@ t the results of that tri@@ al within one year ."
"And in the B@@ M@@ J , in the first ed@@ ition of J@@ an@@ u@@ ary , 20@@ 12 , you can see a study which looks to see if people ke@@ p@@ t to that rul@@ ing , and it turns out that only one in five have done so ."
This is a di@@ sa@@ st@@ er .
We cannot know the true ef@@ fec@@ ts of the medic@@ ines that we pres@@ cri@@ be if we do not have acc@@ ess to all of the information .
And this is not a difficult problem to fi@@ x .
"We need to force people to publ@@ ish all trials conduc@@ ted in hum@@ ans , in@@ cl@@ ud@@ ing the ol@@ der trials , because the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ c@@ t only as@@ ks that you publ@@ ish the trials conduc@@ ted after 200@@ 8 , and I don &apos;t know what world it is in which we &apos;re only pra@@ c@@ tic@@ ing medicine on the bas@@ is of trials that complet@@ ed in the past two years ."
"We need to publ@@ ish all trials in hum@@ ans , in@@ cl@@ ud@@ ing the ol@@ der trials , for all dru@@ gs in cur@@ r@@ ent use , and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fi@@ x@@ ed ."
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
P@@ ul@@ l the k@@ not .
The ph@@ enom@@ en@@ on you saw here for a bri@@ ef moment is called quantum lev@@ itation and quantum loc@@ king .
And the ob@@ ject that was lev@@ it@@ ating here is called a superconductor .
"S@@ u@@ per@@ conduc@@ ti@@ vity is a quantum state of matter , and it oc@@ cur@@ s only b@@ el@@ ow a certain c@@ rit@@ ical tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"Now , it &apos;s quite an old ph@@ enom@@ en@@ on ; it was disc@@ over@@ ed 100 years ago ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , only rec@@ ently , d@@ ue to s@@ ever@@ al techn@@ ological adv@@ an@@ cem@@ ents , we are now able to demon@@ stra@@ te to you quantum lev@@ itation and quantum loc@@ king ."
"So , a superconductor is defin@@ ed by two pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"The first is z@@ ero elec@@ tr@@ ical res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce , and the second is the ex@@ pul@@ sion of a magnetic field from the inter@@ ior of the superconductor ."
"That s@@ oun@@ ds compl@@ ic@@ ated , right ?"
But what is elec@@ tr@@ ical res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce ?
"So , elec@@ tric@@ ity is the flow of elec@@ t@@ rons inside a material ."
"And these elec@@ t@@ rons , while flo@@ wing , they col@@ l@@ ide with the atoms , and in these col@@ lis@@ ions they l@@ ose a certain amount of energy ."
"And they dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate this energy in the form of he@@ at , and you know that ef@@ fect ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , inside a superconductor there are no col@@ lis@@ ions , so there is no energy dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation ."
It &apos;s quite re@@ mark@@ able . Th@@ ink about it .
"In clas@@ sic@@ al physics , there is always some fr@@ ic@@ tion , some energy l@@ os@@ s ."
"But not here , because it is a quantum ef@@ fect ."
"But that &apos;s not all , because superconduc@@ tors don &apos;t like magnetic fiel@@ ds ."
"So a superconductor will try to ex@@ pe@@ l magnetic field from the inside , and it has the means to do that by cir@@ cul@@ ating cur@@ r@@ ents ."
"Now , the com@@ b@@ in@@ ation of both ef@@ fec@@ ts — the ex@@ pul@@ sion of magnetic fiel@@ ds and z@@ ero elec@@ tr@@ ical res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce — is exactly a superconductor ."
"But the picture isn &apos;t always per@@ fect , as we all know , and some@@ times str@@ ands of magnetic field re@@ ma@@ in inside the superconductor ."
"Now , under pro@@ per con@@ diti@@ ons , which we have here , these str@@ ands of magnetic field can be tra@@ pped inside the superconductor ."
"And these str@@ ands of magnetic field inside the superconductor , they come in dis@@ cre@@ te quan@@ t@@ ities ."
Why ? Because it is a quantum ph@@ enom@@ en@@ on . It &apos;s quantum physics .
And it turns out that they be@@ have like quantum particles .
"In this mo@@ vi@@ e here , you can see how they flow one by one dis@@ cre@@ t@@ ely ."
"This is str@@ ands of magnetic field . These are not particles , but they be@@ have like particles ."
"So , this is why we call this ef@@ fect quantum lev@@ itation and quantum loc@@ king ."
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field ?
"Well , first there are str@@ ands of magnetic field left inside , but now the superconductor doesn &apos;t like them mov@@ ing around , because their mov@@ ements dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate energy , which bre@@ ak@@ s the superconduc@@ ti@@ vity state ."
"So what it actually does , it loc@@ ks these str@@ ands , which are called flu@@ x@@ ons , and it loc@@ ks these flu@@ x@@ ons in place ."
"And by doing that , what it actually does is loc@@ king itself in place ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place , will change their con@@ figura@@ tion ."
So we get quantum loc@@ king . And let me show you how this works .
"I have here a superconductor , which I w@@ ra@@ pped up so it &apos;d st@@ ay c@@ old long enough ."
"And when I place it on top of a re@@ gul@@ ar mag@@ net , it just st@@ a@@ ys loc@@ ked in mi@@ da@@ ir ."
"( Applause ) Now , this is not just lev@@ itation . It &apos;s not just re@@ pul@@ sion ."
"I can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the flu@@ x@@ ons , and it will be loc@@ ked in this new con@@ figura@@ tion ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e this , or move it s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly to the right or to the left ."
"So , this is quantum loc@@ king — actually loc@@ king — thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal loc@@ king of the superconductor ."
"O@@ f course , I can turn it up@@ side down , and it will re@@ ma@@ in loc@@ ked ."
"Now , now that we understand that this so@@ -@@ called lev@@ itation is actually loc@@ king , Y@@ e@@ ah , we understand that ."
"You won &apos;t be sur@@ pris@@ ed to hear that if I take this cir@@ cul@@ ar mag@@ net , in which the magnetic field is the same all around , the superconductor will be able to fre@@ ely ro@@ t@@ ate around the ax@@ is of the mag@@ net ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because as long as it ro@@ t@@ ates , the loc@@ king is ma@@ int@@ ained ."
You see ? I can ad@@ just and I can ro@@ t@@ ate the superconductor .
"We have fr@@ ic@@ tion@@ less mo@@ tion . It is still lev@@ it@@ ating , but can move fre@@ ely all around ."
"So , we have quantum loc@@ king and we can lev@@ it@@ ate it on top of this mag@@ net ."
"But how many flu@@ x@@ ons , how many magnetic str@@ ands are there in a single dis@@ k like this ?"
"Well , we can cal@@ cul@@ ate it , and it turns out , quite a lot ."
One hundred billion str@@ ands of magnetic field inside this thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch dis@@ k .
"But that &apos;s not the ama@@ zing part yet , because there is something I hav@@ en &apos;t told you yet ."
"And , ye@@ ah , the ama@@ zing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a mic@@ ro@@ n th@@ ic@@ k . It &apos;s extre@@ m@@ ely th@@ in ."
"And this extre@@ m@@ ely th@@ in la@@ y@@ er is able to lev@@ it@@ ate more than 7@@ 0,000 times its own we@@ ight ."
It &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ able ef@@ fect . It &apos;s very strong .
"Now , I can ext@@ end this cir@@ cul@@ ar mag@@ net , and make wh@@ at@@ ever trac@@ k I want ."
"For example , I can make a large cir@@ cul@@ ar ra@@ il here ."
"And when I place the superconduc@@ ting dis@@ k on top of this ra@@ il , it mov@@ es fre@@ ely ."
"( Applause ) And again , that &apos;s not all . I can ad@@ just its position like this , and ro@@ t@@ ate , and it fre@@ ely mov@@ es in this new position ."
And I can even try a new thing ; let &apos;s try it for the first time .
"I can take this dis@@ k and put it here , and while it st@@ a@@ ys here — don &apos;t move — I will try to ro@@ t@@ ate the trac@@ k , and h@@ o@@ pe@@ fully , if I did it cor@@ rec@@ tly , it st@@ a@@ ys sus@@ p@@ end@@ ed ."
"( Applause ) You see , it &apos;s quantum loc@@ king , not lev@@ itation ."
"Now , while I &apos;ll let it cir@@ cul@@ ate for a little more , let me tell you a little bit about superconduc@@ tors ."
"Now — ( Laughter ) — So we now know that we are able to trans@@ fer en@@ or@@ mo@@ us amount of cur@@ r@@ ents inside superconduc@@ tors , so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fiel@@ ds , such as needed in M@@ R@@ I ma@@ chin@@ es , partic@@ le acc@@ el@@ er@@ at@@ ors and so on ."
"But we can also st@@ ore energy using superconduc@@ tors , because we have no dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation ."
"And we could also produce power c@@ ab@@ les , to trans@@ fer en@@ or@@ mo@@ us amoun@@ ts of cur@@ r@@ ent between power st@@ ations ."
I@@ mag@@ ine you could back up a single power st@@ ation with a single superconduc@@ ting c@@ able .
But what is the future of quantum lev@@ itation and quantum loc@@ king ?
"Well , let me answer this simple question by giving you an example ."
"I@@ mag@@ ine you would have a dis@@ k si@@ mil@@ ar to the one I have here in my hand , thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch di@@ ame@@ ter , with a single difference ."
"The superconduc@@ ting la@@ y@@ er , instead of being half a mic@@ ro@@ n th@@ in , being two mil@@ li@@ met@@ ers th@@ in , quite th@@ in ."
"This tw@@ o-@@ mil@@ li@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ th@@ in superconduc@@ ting la@@ y@@ er could hold 1@@ ,000 kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s , a small c@@ ar , in my hand ."
A@@ maz@@ ing . Thank you .

"I &apos;m here today to talk about a dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing question , which has an equ@@ ally dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing answer ."
"M@@ y to@@ p@@ ic is the sec@@ re@@ ts of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le is the one question everyone always as@@ ks : Why does she st@@ ay ?"
Why would any@@ one st@@ ay with a man who be@@ at@@ s her ?
"I &apos;m not a psych@@ i@@ at@@ ris@@ t , a social work@@ er or an exper@@ t in domestic violence ."
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 2@@ 2 . I had just grad@@ u@@ ated from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge .
I had mov@@ ed to New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity for my first job as a writ@@ er and ed@@ it@@ or at S@@ ev@@ en@@ te@@ en ma@@ gaz@@ ine .
"I had my first ap@@ art@@ ment , my first little gre@@ en American E@@ x@@ pres@@ s c@@ ard , and I had a very big sec@@ ret ."
"M@@ y sec@@ ret was that I had this gu@@ n lo@@ ad@@ ed with hol@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ point b@@ ul@@ l@@ ets poin@@ ted at my head by the man who I thought was my so@@ ul@@ mate , many , many times ."
The man who I lov@@ ed more than any@@ body on Earth hel@@ d a gu@@ n to my head and thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill me more times than I can even remem@@ ber .
"I &apos;m here to tell you the story of cra@@ z@@ y love , a psych@@ ological tra@@ p dis@@ gu@@ ised as love , one that mil@@ lions of women and even a few men f@@ all into every year ."
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typ@@ ical domestic violence surviv@@ or .
"I have a B@@ .@@ A@@ . in English from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , an M@@ B@@ A in market@@ ing from Wh@@ art@@ on B@@ usiness S@@ cho@@ ol ."
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent most of my c@@ are@@ er working for F@@ or@@ tun@@ e 5@@ 00 comp@@ an@@ ies in@@ cl@@ ud@@ ing Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son &@@ am@@ p@@ ; Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son , Le@@ o B@@ urn@@ et@@ t and The W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton P@@ ost ."
I &apos;ve been marri@@ ed for almost 20 years to my second h@@ us@@ b@@ and and we have three kids together .
"M@@ y do@@ g is a black la@@ b , and I dr@@ ive a H@@ on@@ da O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ y min@@ iv@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone — all ra@@ ces , all religi@@ ons , all income and education lev@@ els ."
It &apos;s every@@ where .
"And my second message is that everyone thin@@ ks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue ."
Not exactly .
"O@@ ver 8@@ 5 percent of ab@@ us@@ ers are men , and domestic ab@@ use happens only in in@@ ti@@ mate , inter@@ dep@@ end@@ ent , lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m relation@@ shi@@ ps , in other words , in famil@@ ies , the last place we would want or exp@@ ect to find violence , which is one reason domestic ab@@ use is so con@@ f@@ using ."
"I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would st@@ ay with a man who be@@ at@@ s me , but in fact I was a very typ@@ ical vic@@ ti@@ m because of my age ."
"I was 2@@ 2 , and in the United States , women ages 1@@ 6 to 2@@ 4 are three times as lik@@ ely to be domestic violence vic@@ tim@@ s as women of other ages , and over 5@@ 00 women and girls this age are kil@@ led every year by ab@@ us@@ ive par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , bo@@ y@@ friends , and h@@ us@@ b@@ ands in the United States ."
"I was also a very typ@@ ical vic@@ ti@@ m because I knew nothing about domestic violence , its war@@ ning sign@@ s or its pat@@ ter@@ n@@ s ."
"I met Con@@ or on a c@@ old , ra@@ in@@ y J@@ an@@ u@@ ary ni@@ ght ."
"He sa@@ t next to me on the New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity sub@@ way , and he started ch@@ at@@ ting me up ."
He told me two things .
"One was that he , too , had just grad@@ u@@ ated from an I@@ v@@ y Le@@ ag@@ ue school , and that he worked at a very im@@ pres@@ sive W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et b@@ ank ."
But what made the big@@ gest im@@ pres@@ sion on me that first me@@ et@@ ing was that he was s@@ mart and fun@@ ny and he looked like a far@@ m bo@@ y .
"He had these big che@@ e@@ ks , these big ap@@ ple che@@ e@@ ks and this wh@@ e@@ at@@ -@@ bl@@ ond h@@ air , and he se@@ em@@ ed so swe@@ et ."
"One of the s@@ mart@@ est things Con@@ or did , from the very beginning , was to create the ill@@ us@@ ion that I was the domin@@ ant par@@ t@@ ner in the relation@@ ship ."
He did this es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally at the beginning by id@@ ol@@ iz@@ ing me .
"We started da@@ ting , and he lov@@ ed everything about me , that I was s@@ mart , that I &apos;d g@@ one to H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , that I was pas@@ sion@@ ate about hel@@ ping te@@ en@@ age girls , and my job ."
He wanted to know everything about my family and my chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood and my hop@@ es and dre@@ ams .
"C@@ on@@ or beli@@ ev@@ ed in me , as a writ@@ er and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had ."
"And he also created a mag@@ ical at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here of trust between us by con@@ f@@ ess@@ ing his sec@@ ret , which was that , as a very young bo@@ y star@@ ting at age four , he had been sav@@ ag@@ ely and re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly physic@@ ally ab@@ used by his ste@@ p@@ father , and the ab@@ use had g@@ ot@@ ten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , even though he was very s@@ mart , and he &apos;d sp@@ ent almost 20 years reb@@ u@@ il@@ ding his life ."
Wh@@ ich is why that I@@ v@@ y Le@@ ag@@ ue de@@ g@@ ree and the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et job and his b@@ right shin@@ y future me@@ ant so much to him .
"If you had told me that this s@@ mart , fun@@ ny , sen@@ s@@ itive man who ad@@ or@@ ed me would one day dic@@ t@@ ate whether or not I wor@@ e ma@@ ke@@ up , how shor@@ t my sk@@ ir@@ ts were , where I liv@@ ed , what j@@ obs I took , who my friends were and where I sp@@ ent Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ mas , I would have l@@ au@@ gh@@ ed at you , because there was not a h@@ in@@ t of violence or contro@@ l or an@@ ger in Con@@ or at the beginning ."
I didn &apos;t know that the first st@@ age in any domestic violence relation@@ ship is to s@@ educ@@ e and char@@ m the vic@@ ti@@ m .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second ste@@ p is to is@@ ol@@ ate the vic@@ ti@@ m .
"Now , Con@@ or did not come home one day and an@@ n@@ oun@@ ce , &quot; &quot; You know , he@@ y , all this R@@ ome@@ o and J@@ ul@@ iet stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next ph@@ ase where I is@@ ol@@ ate you and I ab@@ use you &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; &quot; so I need to get you out of this ap@@ art@@ ment where the ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors can hear you scre@@ am and out of this c@@ ity where you have friends and family and co@@ work@@ ers who can see the br@@ u@@ is@@ es . &quot; &quot; In@@ ste@@ ad , Con@@ or came home one F@@ ri@@ day ev@@ ening and he told me that he had qu@@ it his job that day , his dre@@ am job , and he said that he had qu@@ it his job because of me ,"
"@@ because I had made him feel so sa@@ fe and lov@@ ed that he didn &apos;t need to pro@@ ve h@@ im@@ self on W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et any@@ more , and he just wanted to get out of the c@@ ity and away from his ab@@ us@@ ive , d@@ y@@ s@@ fun@@ c@@ tional family , and move to a tiny to@@ wn in New Engl@@ and where he could start his life over with me by his side ."
"Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New Y@@ or@@ k , and my dre@@ am job , but I thought you made sa@@ cri@@ fic@@ es for your so@@ ul@@ mate , so I ag@@ re@@ ed , and I qu@@ it my job , and Con@@ or and I left M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ tan together ."
"I had no idea I was f@@ all@@ ing into cra@@ z@@ y love , that I was walking he@@ ad@@ first into a c@@ are@@ fully la@@ id physical , fin@@ an@@ cial and psych@@ ological tra@@ p ."
The next ste@@ p in the domestic violence pat@@ tern is to int@@ ro@@ duc@@ e the thre@@ at of violence and see how she re@@ ac@@ ts .
And here &apos;s where those gun@@ s come in .
"As so@@ on as we mov@@ ed to New Engl@@ and — you know , that place where Con@@ n@@ or was sup@@ posed to feel so sa@@ fe — he b@@ ou@@ ght three gun@@ s ."
He ke@@ p@@ t one in the gl@@ ove com@@ par@@ t@@ ment of our c@@ ar .
"He ke@@ p@@ t one under the p@@ il@@ lo@@ ws on our b@@ ed , and the th@@ ir@@ d one he ke@@ p@@ t in his po@@ c@@ k@@ et at all times ."
And he said that he needed those gun@@ s because of the tra@@ um@@ a he &apos;d experienc@@ ed as a young bo@@ y .
He needed them to feel pro@@ t@@ ec@@ ted .
"But those gun@@ s were really a message for me , and even though he h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t ra@@ ised a hand to me , my life was already in gr@@ ave dan@@ ger every min@@ ute of every day ."
Con@@ or first physic@@ ally att@@ ac@@ ked me five days before our wed@@ ding .
It was 7 a@@ .@@ m@@ . I still had on my ni@@ gh@@ t@@ go@@ wn .
"I was working on my computer trying to fin@@ ish a fre@@ el@@ ance writ@@ ing as@@ sign@@ ment , and I got f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted , and Con@@ or used my an@@ ger as an exc@@ use to put both of his h@@ ands around my nec@@ k and to squ@@ e@@ eze so ti@@ gh@@ tly that I could not bre@@ a@@ the or scre@@ am , and he used the cho@@ ke@@ hold to h@@ it my head re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly against the w@@ all ."
"F@@ ive days later , the ten br@@ u@@ is@@ es on my nec@@ k had just f@@ ad@@ ed , and I put on my mother &apos;s wed@@ ding d@@ ress , and I marri@@ ed him ."
"D@@ es@@ p@@ ite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happ@@ ily ever after , because I lov@@ ed him , and he lov@@ ed me so much ."
"And he was very , very sor@@ ry ."
He had just been really st@@ res@@ sed out by the wed@@ ding and by becom@@ ing a family with me .
"It was an is@@ ol@@ ated inc@@ ident , and he was never going to h@@ ur@@ t me again ."
It happened tw@@ ice more on the hon@@ ey@@ moon .
"The first time , I was driv@@ ing to find a sec@@ ret be@@ ach and I got lost , and he p@@ un@@ ched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly h@@ it the driv@@ er &apos;s side w@@ ind@@ ow ."
"And then a few days later , driv@@ ing home from our hon@@ ey@@ moon , he got f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted by t@@ raf@@ f@@ ic , and he thre@@ w a c@@ old Big M@@ ac in my face ."
Con@@ or pro@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed to be@@ at me once or tw@@ ice a wee@@ k for the next two and a half years of our marri@@ age .
I was mis@@ taken in thinking that I was uni@@ qu@@ e and alone in this sit@@ u@@ ation .
"One in three American women experi@@ ences domestic violence or st@@ al@@ king at some point in her life , and the C@@ D@@ C re@@ por@@ ts that 15 million children are ab@@ used every year , 15 million ."
"So actually , I was in very good comp@@ any ."
B@@ ack to my question : Why did I st@@ ay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was ab@@ using me .
"E@@ v@@ en though he hel@@ d those lo@@ ad@@ ed gun@@ s to my head , p@@ u@@ shed me down stair@@ s , thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill our do@@ g , pul@@ led the k@@ ey out of the c@@ ar ign@@ ition as I drove down the high@@ way , p@@ ou@@ red co@@ f@@ fe@@ e gr@@ in@@ ds on my head as I d@@ res@@ sed for a job inter@@ view , I never once thought of myself as a b@@ at@@ tered wife ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I was a very strong woman in love with a de@@ e@@ ply tro@@ ub@@ led man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Con@@ or face his demon@@ s ."
"The other question everybody as@@ ks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
Why didn &apos;t I wal@@ k out ? I could have left any time .
"T@@ o me , this is the sa@@ d@@ d@@ est and most pain@@ ful question that people ask , because we vic@@ tim@@ s know something you us@@ ually don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredi@@ bly dan@@ ger@@ ous to leave an ab@@ us@@ er ."
Because the fin@@ al ste@@ p in the domestic violence pat@@ tern is k@@ ill her .
"O@@ ver 70 percent of domestic violence m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers happen after the vic@@ ti@@ m has end@@ ed the relation@@ ship , after she &apos;s g@@ ot@@ ten out , because then the ab@@ us@@ er has nothing left to l@@ ose ."
"O@@ ther ou@@ t@@ comes in@@ cl@@ u@@ de lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m st@@ al@@ king , even after the ab@@ us@@ er re@@ marri@@ es ; den@@ i@@ al of fin@@ an@@ cial resour@@ ces ; and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ation of the family cour@@ t system to ter@@ ri@@ f@@ y the vic@@ ti@@ m and her children , who are re@@ gul@@ arly for@@ ced by family cour@@ t j@@ ud@@ g@@ es to sp@@ end un@@ super@@ vis@@ ed time with the man who be@@ at their mother ."
"And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
"I was able to leave , because of one fin@@ al , sa@@ dis@@ tic be@@ ating that bro@@ ke through my den@@ i@@ al ."
I realiz@@ ed that the man who I lov@@ ed so much was going to k@@ ill me if I let him .
So I bro@@ ke the sil@@ ence .
"I told everyone : the pol@@ ice , my ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors , my friends and family , tot@@ al str@@ ang@@ ers , and I &apos;m here today because you all hel@@ ped me ."
"We t@@ end to st@@ ere@@ ot@@ yp@@ e vic@@ tim@@ s as gr@@ is@@ ly he@@ ad@@ l@@ ines , self-@@ des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tive women , da@@ mag@@ ed go@@ od@@ s ."
"The question , &quot; &quot; Why does she st@@ ay ? &quot; &quot; is cod@@ e for some people for , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s her fa@@ ult for st@@ a@@ ying , &quot; &quot; as if vic@@ tim@@ s int@@ enti@@ on@@ ally cho@@ ose to f@@ all in love with men int@@ ent up@@ on des@@ tro@@ ying us ."
"But since publi@@ sh@@ ing &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ z@@ y L@@ ove , &quot; &quot; I have heard hund@@ re@@ ds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an in@@ val@@ u@@ able life les@@ son from what happened , and who reb@@ u@@ il@@ t lives — jo@@ y@@ ous , happy lives — as em@@ pl@@ o@@ ye@@ es , w@@ iv@@ es and mothers , lives complet@@ ely f@@ ree of violence , like me ."
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very typ@@ ical domestic violence vic@@ ti@@ m and a typ@@ ical domestic violence surviv@@ or .
"I re@@ marri@@ ed a kind and g@@ ent@@ le man , and we have those three kids ."
"I have that black la@@ b , and I have that min@@ iv@@ an ."
"What I will never have again , ever , is a lo@@ ad@@ ed gu@@ n hel@@ d to my head by someone who says that he lov@@ es me ."
"@@ R@@ ight now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; W@@ ow , this is fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , how st@@ up@@ id was she , &quot; &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you ."
I p@@ rom@@ ise you there are s@@ ever@@ al people l@@ ist@@ ening to me right now who are cur@@ r@@ ently being ab@@ used or who were ab@@ used as children or who are ab@@ us@@ ers themselves .
"A@@ b@@ use could be af@@ fec@@ ting your daughter , your sis@@ ter , your best fri@@ end right now ."
I was able to end my own cra@@ z@@ y love story by bre@@ ak@@ ing the sil@@ ence .
I &apos;m still bre@@ ak@@ ing the sil@@ ence today .
"It &apos;s my way of hel@@ ping other vic@@ tim@@ s , and it &apos;s my fin@@ al requ@@ est of you ."
Tal@@ k about what you heard here .
A@@ b@@ use th@@ r@@ iv@@ es only in sil@@ ence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shin@@ ing a sp@@ ot@@ light on it .
We vic@@ tim@@ s need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the sec@@ re@@ ts of domestic violence .
"S@@ how ab@@ use the light of day by talking about it with your children , your co@@ work@@ ers , your friends and family ."
"@@ R@@ ec@@ ast surviv@@ ors as wonderful , lov@@ able people with ful@@ l fut@@ ures ."
"@@ R@@ ec@@ ogni@@ ze the early sign@@ s of violence and con@@ sci@@ enti@@ ously inter@@ ven@@ e , de@@ es@@ cal@@ ate it , show vic@@ tim@@ s a sa@@ fe way out ."
"T@@ ogether we can make our bed@@ s , our din@@ ner t@@ ab@@ les and our famil@@ ies the sa@@ fe and pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful o@@ as@@ es they should be ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"This , I think , is so de@@ e@@ ply em@@ bed@@ ded in the water sup@@ ply that it wouldn &apos;t occ@@ ur to any@@ one to question it ."
This is my super@@ mark@@ et .
"One con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the ph@@ one never bro@@ ke ."
"We now have an almost un@@ lim@@ ited vari@@ ety of ph@@ ones , es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally in the world of cell ph@@ ones ."
These are cell ph@@ ones of the future .
"M@@ y fav@@ or@@ ite is the middle one — the M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er , n@@ ose h@@ air tri@@ m@@ m@@ er , and c@@ r@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e t@@ or@@ ch ."
So par@@ al@@ y@@ sis is a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of having too many cho@@ ices .
Th@@ ir@@ d : es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ t@@ ations .
You want b@@ ut@@ ton f@@ ly or z@@ ip@@ per f@@ ly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ wa@@ shed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ wa@@ shed ?
"I had very low , no particular expec@@ t@@ ations when they only came in one fl@@ av@@ or ."
I c@@ ouldn &apos;t have done better .
"W@@ it@@ h a hundred different kinds of j@@ e@@ ans on dis@@ pl@@ ay , there is no exc@@ use for fail@@ ure ."
"And so the net res@@ ult is that we do better in gener@@ al , ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vely , and we feel worse ."
So let me re@@ mind you .
There &apos;s some mag@@ ical amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
They actually make us worse off .
Thank you very much .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body tal@@ ks about happiness these days .
"There is a hu@@ ge w@@ ave of inter@@ est in happiness , amo@@ n@@ g rese@@ arch@@ ers ."
There is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body would like to make people happ@@ i@@ er .
And my talk today will be mo@@ st@@ ly about these c@@ ogn@@ itive tra@@ ps .
"This app@@ lies to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as m@@ ess@@ ed up as any@@ body else is ."
The first of these tra@@ ps is a rel@@ uc@@ tan@@ ce to ad@@ mit compl@@ ex@@ ity .
"It turns out that the word &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; is just not a us@@ e@@ ful word any@@ more , because we ap@@ ply it to too many different things ."
"And those are two very different con@@ cep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both l@@ um@@ ped in the not@@ ion of happiness ."
"I mean , this is a real c@@ ogn@@ itive tra@@ p ."
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
"Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a ques@@ tion@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ answer s@@ es@@ sion after one of my lec@@ tures re@@ por@@ ted a story , and that was a story — He said he &apos;d been l@@ ist@@ ening to a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y , and it was absol@@ ut@@ ely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the rec@@ ord@@ ing , there was a d@@ read@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ch@@ ing sound ."
"And then he ad@@ ded , really quite emo@@ tion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience ."
But it h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ ined were the me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous music .
"They coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a me@@ mor@@ y ; the me@@ mor@@ y was ru@@ ined , and the me@@ mor@@ y was all that he had g@@ ot@@ ten to keep ."
"There is an experiencing self , who lives in the pres@@ ent and kno@@ ws the pres@@ ent , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ liv@@ ing the past , but basically it has only the pres@@ ent ."
"It &apos;s the experiencing self that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es — you know , when the doc@@ tor as@@ ks , &quot; D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I tou@@ ch you here ? &quot;"
"And then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ e@@ ps sc@@ ore , and ma@@ int@@ ains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feel@@ ing l@@ ately ? &quot;"
or &quot; &quot; How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; &quot; or something like that .
"Th@@ ose are two very different ent@@ ities , the experiencing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting con@@ f@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the not@@ ion of happiness ."
"Now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a st@@ or@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ er ."
And that really star@@ ts with a bas@@ ic respon@@ se of our me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es — it star@@ ts im@@ medi@@ ately .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
And let me be@@ g@@ in with one example .
They were asked to re@@ port on their pain every 60 secon@@ ds .
"@@ Here are two patients , those are their rec@@ ord@@ ings ."
"And you are asked , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o of them suf@@ fer@@ ed more ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a very easy question ."
"C@@ lear@@ ly , P@@ ati@@ ent B suf@@ fer@@ ed more — his col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y was longer , and every min@@ ute of pain that P@@ ati@@ ent A had , P@@ ati@@ ent B had , and more ."
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suf@@ fer@@ ed ? &quot;
And here is a sur@@ pr@@ ise .
The sur@@ pr@@ ise is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much worse me@@ mor@@ y of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
"The stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ pi@@ es were different , and because a very c@@ rit@@ ical part of the story is how it ends ."
And nei@@ ther of these stories is very in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing or great — but one of them is this dis@@ tin@@ c@@ t ... ( Laughter ) but one of them is dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tly worse than the other .
And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its pe@@ ak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
"Because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in tot@@ al ? &quot;"
"And it was much worse for A than for B , in me@@ mor@@ y ."
Now this is a direc@@ t con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t between the experiencing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experiencing self , c@@ lear@@ ly , B had a worse time ."
"Now , what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A , and we actually ra@@ n cl@@ in@@ ical experim@@ ents , and it has been done , and it does work — you could actually ext@@ end the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ e@@ ping the tu@@ be in without j@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing it too much ."
"That will cause the pati@@ ent to suf@@ fer , but just a little and much less than before ."
"And that is true of the stories that me@@ mor@@ y del@@ iv@@ ers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up ."
"What defin@@ es a story are changes , sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant mo@@ ments and end@@ ings ."
"E@@ nd@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the end@@ ing domin@@ ated ."
"Now , the experiencing self lives its life contin@@ u@@ ously ."
"It has mo@@ ments of experience , one after the other ."
And you can ask : What happens to these mo@@ ments ?
And the answer is really stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward : They are lost forever .
M@@ ost of them are complet@@ ely ign@@ or@@ ed by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"And yet , some@@ how you get the sense that they should coun@@ t , that what happens d@@ uring these mo@@ ments of experience is our life ."
It &apos;s the fin@@ ite resour@@ ce that we &apos;re sp@@ end@@ ing while we &apos;re on this ear@@ th .
"And how to sp@@ end it would seem to be rel@@ ev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self ke@@ e@@ ps for us ."
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second wee@@ k is just as good as the first , then the tw@@ o-@@ wee@@ k vac@@ ation is tw@@ ice as good as the on@@ e-@@ wee@@ k vac@@ ation ."
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
The experiencing self has no vo@@ ice in this cho@@ ice .
"We actually don &apos;t cho@@ ose between experi@@ ences , we cho@@ ose between me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es of experi@@ ences ."
"And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future nor@@ m@@ ally as experi@@ ences ."
We think of our future as an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es .
"I have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very fre@@ qu@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large ext@@ ent , in the ser@@ vic@@ e of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self ."
And this is a bit hard to j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y I think .
"I mean , how much do we con@@ su@@ me our me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es ?"
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is giv@@ en for the domin@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an h@@ our and a half ."
There seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy .
"Now , I may be a bit extre@@ me , you know , in how little app@@ et@@ ite I have for cons@@ um@@ ing me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : Why do we put so much we@@ ight on me@@ mor@@ y relati@@ ve to the we@@ ight that we put on experi@@ ences ?"
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
"I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pic@@ tures will be des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic dru@@ g so that you won &apos;t remem@@ ber anything ."
Why do we pic@@ k the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a cho@@ ice between the two selves .
"Now , the two selves bring up two not@@ ions of happiness ."
"There are really two con@@ cep@@ ts of happiness that we can ap@@ ply , one per self ."
So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the mo@@ ments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all — happiness for mo@@ ments is a fa@@ ir@@ ly compl@@ ic@@ ated process .
What are the emo@@ tions that can be meas@@ ured ?
"And , by the way , now we are cap@@ able of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time ."
It is about how sat@@ is@@ fied or pleas@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life .
V@@ ery different not@@ ion .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ one who doesn &apos;t dis@@ t@@ ing@@ u@@ ish those not@@ ions is going to m@@ ess up the study of happiness , and I b@@ el@@ ong to a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d of students of well-being , who &apos;ve been m@@ ess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in prec@@ is@@ ely this way ."
"The dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between the happiness of the experiencing self and the sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ z@@ ed in rec@@ ent years , and there are now ef@@ for@@ ts to measure the two se@@ par@@ ately ."
"So in rec@@ ent years , we have be@@ gu@@ n to learn about the happiness of the two selves ."
And the ma@@ in les@@ son I think that we have learned is they are really different .
"@@ Just to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation , the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5 ."
"What that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; &quot; O@@ h his father is six fe@@ et t@@ all , &quot; &quot; how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?"
You have that much un@@ cert@@ ain@@ ty .
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low .
We know something about what contro@@ ls sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
"We know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important ."
"We know that happiness is main@@ ly being sat@@ is@@ fied with people that we like , sp@@ end@@ ing time with people that we like ."
"There are other pleas@@ ures , but this is domin@@ ant ."
The bot@@ tom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ st@@ it@@ ute for well-being .
It is a complet@@ ely different not@@ ion .
"Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think stra@@ ight about happiness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live ."
"So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t answer ."
"Well , it turns out that cli@@ mate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive self that decid@@ es how happy people are ."
We know that .
"It is very difficult to think stra@@ ight about well-being , and I hop@@ e I have giv@@ en you a sense of how difficult it is ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris A@@ nd@@ er@@ son : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
"Now , when we were on the ph@@ one a few weeks ago , you men@@ tion@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting res@@ ult came out of that G@@ all@@ up surv@@ ey ."
"When we looked at how feel@@ ings , v@@ ary with income ."
"And it turns out that , b@@ el@@ ow an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for Americ@@ ans — and that &apos;s a very large sam@@ ple of Americ@@ ans , like 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , so it &apos;s a large re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple — b@@ el@@ ow an income of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year ..@@ ."
"C@@ A : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"D@@ K : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"( Laughter ) 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get progres@@ si@@ vely un@@ happ@@ i@@ er the poor@@ er they get ."
"A@@ b@@ ove that , we get an absol@@ ut@@ ely fl@@ at line ."
I mean I &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen l@@ ines so fl@@ at .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ enti@@ al happiness , but l@@ ack of money cert@@ ain@@ ly bu@@ ys you mis@@ ery , and we can measure that mis@@ ery very , very c@@ lear@@ ly ."
"In terms of the other self , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story ."
"The more money you ear@@ n , the more sat@@ is@@ fied you are ."
That does not hold for emo@@ tions .
"C@@ A : But D@@ an@@ ny , the whole American en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about life , li@@ b@@ erty , the pur@@ su@@ it of happiness ."
"If people took seri@@ ously that fin@@ ding , I mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation pol@@ ic@@ y and so for@@ th ."
People are recogni@@ zing that they ou@@ ght to be thinking of happiness when they think of publi@@ c pol@@ ic@@ y .
"This is going to in@@ flu@@ ence pol@@ ic@@ y , I think , in years to come ."
"This is going to be , I think , within the next dec@@ ad@@ e or two , part of national stat@@ is@@ tics ."
"C@@ A : Well , it seems to me that this issue will — or at le@@ ast should be — the most interesting pol@@ ic@@ y disc@@ us@@ sion to trac@@ k over the next few years ."
"For the next few minutes we &apos;re going to talk about energy , and it &apos;s going to be a bit of a vari@@ ed talk ."
"I &apos;ll try to sp@@ in a story about energy , and oil &apos;s a con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent star@@ ting place ."
"The talk will be bro@@ ad@@ ly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start ."
And one of the reas@@ ons is this is re@@ mark@@ able stuff .
"You take about eight or so car@@ b@@ on atoms , about 20 hy@@ d@@ rog@@ en atoms , you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this mar@@ vel@@ ous li@@ qu@@ id : very energ@@ y-@@ den@@ se and very easy to re@@ fin@@ e into a number of very us@@ e@@ ful produc@@ ts and fu@@ els ."
It &apos;s great stuff .
"Now , as far as it goes , there &apos;s a lot of oil out there in the world ."
Here &apos;s my little po@@ c@@ k@@ et ma@@ p of where it &apos;s all loc@@ ated .
A big@@ ger one for you to look at .
"But this is it , this is the oil in the world ."
G@@ e@@ olog@@ ists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is .
This is about 100 tr@@ il@@ lion g@@ all@@ ons of c@@ ru@@ de oil still to be developed and produc@@ ed in the world today .
"Now , that &apos;s just one story about oil , and we could end it there and say , &quot; &quot; Well , oil &apos;s going to last forever because , well , there &apos;s just a lot of it . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s actually more to the story than that ."
"O@@ h , by the way , if you think you &apos;re very far from some of this oil , 1@@ 000 met@@ ers b@@ el@@ ow where you &apos;re all sit@@ ting is one of the larg@@ est produc@@ ing oil fiel@@ ds in the world ."
"C@@ ome talk to me about it , I &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the deta@@ ils if you want ."
"So , that &apos;s one of the stories of oil ; there &apos;s just a lot of it ."
But what about oil ? Wh@@ ere is it in the energy system ?
"@@ Here &apos;s a little s@@ n@@ ap@@ sh@@ ot of 150 years of oil , and it &apos;s been a domin@@ ant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years ."
"Now , here &apos;s another little sec@@ ret I &apos;m going to tell you about : F@@ or the last 2@@ 5 years , oil has been pl@@ a@@ ying less and less of a ro@@ le in global energy sy@@ st@@ ems ."
"There was one kind of pe@@ ak oil in 198@@ 5 , when oil re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ed 50 percent of global energy sup@@ ply ."
"Now , it &apos;s about 3@@ 5 percent ."
It &apos;s been de@@ cl@@ in@@ ing and I believe it will contin@@ ue to de@@ cl@@ ine .
G@@ as@@ ol@@ ine cons@@ um@@ p@@ tion in the U.S. probably pe@@ ak@@ ed in 200@@ 7 and is de@@ cl@@ in@@ ing .
So oil is pl@@ a@@ ying a less sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant ro@@ le every year .
"And so , 2@@ 5 years ago , there was a pe@@ ak oil ; just like , in the 19@@ 20@@ s , there was a pe@@ ak co@@ al ; and a hundred years before that , there was a pe@@ ak w@@ ood ."
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy sy@@ st@@ ems .
And what &apos;s been tak@@ ing up the sl@@ ack in the last few dec@@ ad@@ es ?
"Well , a lot of natural ga@@ s and a little bit of n@@ uc@@ lear , for star@@ ters ."
And what goes on in the future ?
"Well , I think out a@@ head of us a few dec@@ ad@@ es is pe@@ ak ga@@ s , and be@@ y@@ ond that , pe@@ ak r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les ."
"Now , I &apos;ll tell you another little , very important story about this picture ."
"Now , I &apos;m not pret@@ end@@ ing that energy use in tot@@ al isn &apos;t increas@@ ing , it is — that &apos;s another part of the story . C@@ ome talk to me about it , we &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the deta@@ ils — but there &apos;s a very important message here : This is 200 years of history , and for 200 years we &apos;ve been sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tically dec@@ ar@@ b@@ on@@ iz@@ ing our energy system ."
"E@@ ner@@ g@@ y sy@@ st@@ ems of the world becom@@ ing progres@@ si@@ vely — year on year , dec@@ ad@@ e on dec@@ ad@@ e , century on century — becom@@ ing less car@@ b@@ on int@@ en@@ se ."
"And that contin@@ ues into the future with the r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les that we &apos;re develop@@ ing today , re@@ ach@@ ing maybe 30 percent of pri@@ mar@@ y energy by mi@@ d century ."
"Now that might be the end of the story — O@@ kay , we just re@@ place it all with con@@ ven@@ tional r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les — but I think , actually , there &apos;s more to the story than that ."
And to tell the next part of the story — and this is looking out say 2@@ 100 and be@@ y@@ ond .
"What is the future of truly su@@ st@@ ain@@ able , car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ f@@ ree energy ?"
"Well , we have to take a little ex@@ cur@@ sion , and we &apos;ll start in cent@@ ral T@@ ex@@ as ."
Here &apos;s a piece of lim@@ est@@ one .
"I pic@@ ked it up outside of Mar@@ ble F@@ all@@ s , T@@ ex@@ as ."
It &apos;s about 4@@ 00 million years old .
"And it &apos;s just lim@@ est@@ one , nothing really speci@@ al about it ."
"Now , here &apos;s a piece of ch@@ al@@ k ."
I pic@@ ked this up at M@@ I@@ T . It &apos;s a little youn@@ ger .
"And it &apos;s different than this lim@@ est@@ one , you can see that ."
"You wouldn &apos;t build a buil@@ ding out of this stuff , and you wouldn &apos;t try to give a lec@@ ture and w@@ r@@ ite on the ch@@ al@@ k@@ bo@@ ard with this ."
"@@ Y@@ e@@ ah , it &apos;s very different — no , it &apos;s not different ."
"It &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate , cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate ."
What &apos;s different is how the molecul@@ es are put together .
"Now , if you think that &apos;s kind of ne@@ at , the story gets really ne@@ at right now ."
O@@ f@@ f the co@@ ast of C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia comes this : It &apos;s an ab@@ alone sh@@ ell .
"Now , mil@@ lions of ab@@ alone every year make this sh@@ ell ."
"O@@ h , by the way , just in case you wer@@ en &apos;t already gu@@ ess@@ ing , it &apos;s cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate ."
It &apos;s the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this .
But it &apos;s not the same stuff ; it &apos;s different .
"It &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3@@ ,000 times tou@@ gh@@ er than this ."
"And why ? Because the lo@@ w@@ ly ab@@ alone is able to la@@ y down the cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ als in la@@ y@@ ers , making this beautiful , ir@@ id@@ es@@ cent mother of pe@@ ar@@ l ."
"@@ V@@ ery speci@@ aliz@@ ed material that the ab@@ alone self-@@ as@@ s@@ em@@ bl@@ es , mil@@ lions of ab@@ alone , all the time , every day , every year ."
This is pretty incredible stuff .
"A@@ ll the same , what &apos;s different ?"
How the molecul@@ es are put together .
"Now , what does this have to do with energy ?"
Here &apos;s a piece of co@@ al .
And I &apos;ll su@@ g@@ gest that this co@@ al is about as exc@@ iting as this ch@@ al@@ k .
"Now , whether we &apos;re talking about fu@@ els or energy car@@ ri@@ ers , or perhaps nov@@ el materi@@ als for b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies or fu@@ el cells , nature h@@ as@@ n &apos;t ever built those per@@ fect materi@@ als yet because nature didn &apos;t need to ."
"@@ N@@ ature didn &apos;t need to because , un@@ like the ab@@ alone sh@@ ell , the surviv@@ al of a spec@@ ies didn &apos;t dep@@ end on buil@@ ding those materi@@ als , until maybe now when it might just matter ."
"So , when we think about the future of energy , imagine what would it be like if instead of this , we could build the energy equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent of this just by re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging the molecul@@ es differ@@ ently ."
And so that is my story .
The oil will never ru@@ n out .
It &apos;s not because we have a lot of it .
It &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a b@@ a@@ j@@ il@@ lion w@@ ind@@ mil@@ ls .
"It &apos;s because , well , thousands of years ago , people inv@@ ent@@ ed ideas — they had ideas , in@@ nov@@ ations , technology — and the St@@ one A@@ ge end@@ ed , not because we ra@@ n out of st@@ ones ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s ideas , it &apos;s in@@ nov@@ ation , it &apos;s technology that will end the age of oil , long before we ru@@ n out of oil ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Thank you . I have to tell you I &apos;m both challen@@ g@@ ed and exc@@ ited .
T@@ R : Th@@ an@@ ks for the inter@@ action on a high level there .
"But if you ask people , why didn &apos;t you achi@@ eve something ?"
"S@@ omebody who &apos;s working for you , or a par@@ t@@ ner , or even yourself ."
( Applause ) ( Laughter ) And you cor@@ rec@@ t me if I &apos;m wrong .
"Wh@@ o &apos;s been there ? S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : A@@ y@@ e ."
We need vari@@ ety . We need sur@@ pr@@ ise .
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day .
"In my own hum@@ an@@ ity and mis@@ takes , I &apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried ."
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been pre@@ par@@ ing for it our whole lives .
How do you explain when things don &apos;t go as we as@@ su@@ me ?
"O@@ r better , how do you explain when others are able to achi@@ eve things that seem to de@@ f@@ y all of the as@@ s@@ um@@ p@@ tions ?"
F@@ or example : Why is Ap@@ ple so in@@ nov@@ ative ?
"@@ Y@@ e@@ ar after year , after year , they &apos;re more in@@ nov@@ ative than all their comp@@ et@@ ition ."
"And yet , they &apos;re just a computer comp@@ any ."
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
Why is it that Mar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing led the C@@ iv@@ il R@@ igh@@ ts M@@ ov@@ ement ?
"He wasn &apos;t the only man who suf@@ fer@@ ed in pre@@ -@@ c@@ iv@@ il ri@@ ghts America , and he cert@@ ain@@ ly wasn &apos;t the only great or@@ at@@ or of the day ."
"And this disc@@ ov@@ ery prof@@ ou@@ nd@@ ly changed my view on how I thought the world worked , and it even prof@@ ou@@ nd@@ ly changed the way in which I oper@@ ate in it ."
"As it turns out , there &apos;s a pat@@ tern ."
And it &apos;s the complet@@ e op@@ pos@@ ite to everyone else .
"A@@ ll I did was co@@ dif@@ y it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s sim@@ pl@@ est idea ."
I call it the gol@@ den cir@@ cle .
This little idea expl@@ ains why some organiz@@ ations and some lead@@ ers are able to in@@ sp@@ ire where others ar@@ en &apos;t .
Let me defin@@ e the terms really quickly .
"E@@ very single person , every single organiz@@ ation on the planet kno@@ ws what they do , 100 percent ."
"But very , very few people or organiz@@ ations know why they do what they do ."
"B@@ y &quot; &quot; why , &quot; &quot; I mean : What &apos;s your pur@@ pose ?"
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your beli@@ ef ?
Why do you get out of b@@ ed in the mor@@ ning ?
I use Ap@@ ple because they &apos;re easy to understand and everybody gets it .
"They &apos;re beauti@@ fully des@@ ign@@ ed , simple to use and us@@ er fri@@ end@@ ly ."
Here &apos;s how Ap@@ ple actually commun@@ ic@@ ates .
"&quot; &quot; E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing we do , we believe in challen@@ ging the stat@@ us qu@@ o ."
We believe in thinking differ@@ ently .
We just happen to make great comput@@ ers .
"But we &apos;re also per@@ fec@@ tly com@@ for@@ table bu@@ ying an M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er from Ap@@ ple , or a ph@@ one from Ap@@ ple , or a D@@ V@@ R from Ap@@ ple ."
Th@@ e@@ ir comp@@ et@@ it@@ ors are equ@@ ally qu@@ ali@@ fied to make all of these produc@@ ts .
"A few years ago , G@@ at@@ e@@ way came out with fl@@ at@@ -@@ scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s ."
They &apos;re em@@ in@@ ently qu@@ ali@@ fied to make fl@@ at@@ -@@ scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s .
N@@ ob@@ ody b@@ ou@@ ght one .
It &apos;s all gro@@ und@@ ed in the t@@ en@@ ets of bi@@ ology .
"@@ Not psych@@ ology , bi@@ ology ."
"O@@ ur new@@ est brain , our H@@ omo sa@@ pi@@ en brain , our ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x , cor@@ respon@@ ds with the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; level ."
The ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x is responsi@@ ble for all of our ra@@ tional and anal@@ y@@ tical thought and language .
"The middle two sec@@ tions make up our lim@@ b@@ ic bra@@ ins , and our lim@@ b@@ ic bra@@ ins are responsi@@ ble for all of our feel@@ ings , like trust and lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty ."
It just doesn &apos;t dr@@ ive behav@@ ior .
This is where g@@ ut dec@@ is@@ ions come from .
The go@@ al is not just to h@@ ire people who need a job ; it &apos;s to h@@ ire people who believe what you believe .
M@@ ost people don &apos;t know about S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ ier@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley .
"And S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ ier@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley had , what we as@@ su@@ me , to be the re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for success ."
M@@ on@@ ey was no problem .
He h@@ i@@ red the best min@@ ds money could find and the mark@@ et con@@ diti@@ ons were f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic .
"The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es follo@@ wed him around every@@ where , and everyone was ro@@ ot@@ ing for L@@ ang@@ ley ."
Th@@ en how come we &apos;ve never heard of S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ ier@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley ?
"The difference was , O@@ r@@ vil@@ le and W@@ il@@ b@@ ur were driv@@ en by a cause , by a pur@@ pose , by a beli@@ ef ."
"They beli@@ ev@@ ed that if they could fig@@ ure out this fl@@ ying machine , it &apos;ll change the course of the world ."
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the res@@ ult .
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the ri@@ ch@@ es .
"And lo and be@@ hold , look what happened ."
The others just worked for the pa@@ y@@ ch@@ ec@@ k .
"He wasn &apos;t first , he didn &apos;t get rich , he didn &apos;t get famo@@ us , so he qu@@ it ."
But why is it important to at@@ trac@@ t those who believe what you believe ?
The next 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 5 % of our population are our early ad@@ op@@ ters .
"And these gu@@ ys , the in@@ nov@@ at@@ ors and the early ad@@ op@@ ters , they &apos;re com@@ for@@ table making those g@@ ut dec@@ is@@ ions ."
"And , by the way , they didn &apos;t do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for themselves ."
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
"In fact , people will do the things that pro@@ ve what they believe ."
"So let me give you a famo@@ us example , a famo@@ us fail@@ ure and a famo@@ us success of the la@@ w of dif@@ f@@ us@@ ion of in@@ nov@@ ation ."
It &apos;s a com@@ mer@@ cial example .
I Ti@@ V@@ o stuff on my piec@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ j@@ un@@ k T@@ ime W@@ ar@@ ner D@@ V@@ R all the time .
They &apos;ve never made money .
"And when they went I@@ P@@ O , their st@@ ock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then pl@@ um@@ me@@ ted , and it &apos;s never trad@@ ed ab@@ ove 10 ."
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
"In the s@@ um@@ m@@ er of 19@@ 6@@ 3 , 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 people showed up on the m@@ all in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton to hear D@@ r@@ . K@@ ing speak ."
How do you do that ?
But he had a gi@@ ft .
How many of them showed up for him ?
They showed up for themselves .
"We follo@@ wed , not for him , but for ourselves ."
Because there are lead@@ ers and there are those who le@@ ad .
"@@ Le@@ ad@@ ers hold a position of power or au@@ th@@ or@@ ity , but those who le@@ ad in@@ sp@@ ire us ."
"I ’ m going around the world giving tal@@ ks about D@@ ar@@ w@@ in , and us@@ ually what I ’ m talking about is D@@ ar@@ w@@ in ’ s strange in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"Now that tit@@ le , that ph@@ ra@@ se , comes from a c@@ rit@@ ic , an early c@@ rit@@ ic , and this is a pas@@ sage that I just love , and would like to read for you ."
"&quot; &quot; In the theory with which we have to de@@ al , A@@ b@@ sol@@ ute I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance is the ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ er ; so that we may en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate as the fundam@@ ental princi@@ ple of the whole system , that , in order to make a per@@ fect and beautiful machine , it is not requ@@ is@@ ite to know how to make it ."
"This pro@@ position will be found on c@@ are@@ ful exam@@ in@@ ation to ex@@ pres@@ s , in con@@ den@@ sed form , the essenti@@ al pur@@ port of the Th@@ e@@ ory , and to ex@@ pres@@ s in a few words all M@@ r@@ . D@@ ar@@ w@@ in ’ s me@@ an@@ ing ; who , by a strange in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing , seems to think A@@ b@@ sol@@ ute I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance fully qu@@ ali@@ fied to take the place of A@@ b@@ sol@@ ute W@@ is@@ dom in the achi@@ ev@@ ements of cre@@ ative sk@@ ill . &quot; &quot; E@@ x@@ actly . E@@ x@@ actly . And it is a strange in@@ ver@@ sion ."
A cre@@ ati@@ on@@ ist p@@ am@@ ph@@ let has this wonderful p@@ age in it : &quot; &quot; T@@ est T@@ w@@ o : Do you know of any buil@@ ding that didn ’ t have a buil@@ der ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any pain@@ ting that didn ’ t have a pain@@ ter ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any c@@ ar that didn ’ t have a mak@@ er ? Y@@ es / No .
"If you ans@@ wer@@ ed &apos; Y@@ es &apos; for any of the ab@@ ove , give deta@@ ils . &quot; &quot; A@@ -@@ h@@ a ! I mean , it really is a strange in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
You would have thought it st@@ ands to reason that des@@ ign requ@@ ir@@ es an intellig@@ ent des@@ ign@@ er .
But D@@ ar@@ w@@ in sho@@ ws that it ’ s just f@@ al@@ se .
"@@ To@@ day , though , I ’ m going to talk about D@@ ar@@ w@@ in ’ s other strange in@@ ver@@ sion , which is equ@@ ally p@@ uz@@ z@@ l@@ ing at first , but in some ways just as important ."
It st@@ ands to reason that we love ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate c@@ ake because it is swe@@ et .
G@@ u@@ ys go for girls like this because they are s@@ ex@@ y .
We ad@@ ore b@@ ab@@ ies because they ’ re so c@@ ute .
"And , of course , we are am@@ used by jo@@ k@@ es because they are fun@@ ny ."
This is all bac@@ k@@ wards . It is . And D@@ ar@@ w@@ in sho@@ ws us why .
"@@ Let ’ s start with swe@@ et . O@@ ur swe@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is basically an evol@@ ved su@@ ga@@ r det@@ ec@@ tor , because su@@ ga@@ r is high energy , and it ’ s just been wi@@ red up to the pre@@ fer@@ er , to put it very c@@ r@@ ud@@ ely , and that ’ s why we like su@@ ga@@ r ."
"H@@ on@@ ey is swe@@ et because we like it , not &quot; &quot; we like it because hon@@ ey is swe@@ et . &quot; &quot; There ’ s nothing in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic@@ ally swe@@ et about hon@@ ey ."
"If you looked at gl@@ uc@@ ose molecul@@ es t@@ ill you were bl@@ ind , you wouldn ’ t see why they t@@ as@@ ted swe@@ et ."
You have to look in our bra@@ ins to understand why they ’ re swe@@ et .
"So if you think first there was swe@@ et@@ ness , and then we evol@@ ved to like swe@@ et@@ ness , you ’ ve got it bac@@ k@@ wards ; that ’ s just wrong . It ’ s the other way ro@@ und ."
S@@ we@@ et@@ ness was born with the w@@ ir@@ ing which evol@@ ved .
And there ’ s nothing in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic@@ ally s@@ ex@@ y about these young la@@ di@@ es .
"And it ’ s a good thing that there isn ’ t , because if there were , then M@@ other N@@ ature would have a problem : How on ear@@ th do you get ch@@ im@@ ps to mate ?"
"Now you might think , ah , there ’ s a sol@@ ution : h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ations ."
"That would be one way of doing it , but there ’ s a quick@@ er way ."
"@@ Just w@@ ire the ch@@ im@@ ps up to love that look , and ap@@ par@@ ently they do ."
That ’ s all there is to it .
"O@@ ver six million years , we and the ch@@ im@@ ps evol@@ ved our different ways ."
"We bec@@ ame bal@@ d@@ -@@ bo@@ di@@ ed , od@@ d@@ ly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn ’ t ."
"If we h@@ ad@@ n ’ t , then probably this would be the he@@ ight of s@@ ex@@ iness ."
O@@ ur swe@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is an evol@@ ved and inst@@ inc@@ tu@@ al pre@@ fer@@ ence for high@@ -@@ energy f@@ ood .
It wasn ’ t des@@ ign@@ ed for ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate c@@ ake .
Ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate c@@ ake is a super@@ nor@@ mal s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us .
"The ter@@ m is o@@ wed to N@@ ik@@ o T@@ in@@ ber@@ g@@ en , who did his famo@@ us experim@@ ents with gul@@ ls , where he found that that or@@ an@@ ge sp@@ ot on the gul@@ l ’ s be@@ ak — if he made a big@@ ger , or@@ an@@ ger sp@@ ot the gul@@ l ch@@ ic@@ ks would p@@ ec@@ k at it even har@@ der ."
"It was a hy@@ per@@ s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us for them , and they lov@@ ed it ."
"What we see with , say , ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate c@@ ake is it ’ s a super@@ nor@@ mal s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us to tw@@ e@@ ak our des@@ ign w@@ ir@@ ing ."
And there are lots of super@@ nor@@ mal s@@ tim@@ uli ; ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate c@@ ake is one .
There &apos;s lots of super@@ nor@@ mal s@@ tim@@ uli for s@@ ex@@ iness .
And there &apos;s even super@@ nor@@ mal s@@ tim@@ uli for c@@ ut@@ en@@ ess . Here ’ s a pretty good example .
"It ’ s important that we love b@@ ab@@ ies , and that we not be put off by , say , m@@ ess@@ y di@@ ap@@ ers ."
"So b@@ ab@@ ies have to at@@ trac@@ t our af@@ fec@@ tion and our n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing , and they do ."
"And , by the way , a rec@@ ent study sho@@ ws that mothers pre@@ fer the sm@@ ell of the d@@ ir@@ ty di@@ ap@@ ers of their own b@@ ab@@ y ."
So nature works on many lev@@ els here .
"But now , if b@@ ab@@ ies didn ’ t look the way they do — if b@@ ab@@ ies looked like this , that ’ s what we would find ad@@ or@@ able , that ’ s what we would find — we would think , o@@ h my go@@ od@@ ness , do I ever want to hu@@ g that ."
This is the strange in@@ ver@@ sion .
"Well now , finally what about fun@@ ny . M@@ y answer is , it ’ s the same story , the same story ."
"This is the hard one , the one that isn ’ t ob@@ vi@@ ous . That ’ s why I leave it to the end ."
And I won ’ t be able to say too much about it .
"But you have to think evolu@@ tion@@ ar@@ ily , you have to think , what hard job that has to be done — it ’ s d@@ ir@@ ty work , somebody ’ s got to do it — is so important to give us such a po@@ wer@@ ful , in@@ built re@@ ward for it when we suc@@ ce@@ ed ."
"Now , I think we &apos;ve found the answer — I and a few of my colle@@ ag@@ ues ."
It ’ s a ne@@ ural system that ’ s wi@@ red up to re@@ ward the brain for doing a gr@@ ub@@ by cl@@ er@@ ical job .
O@@ ur b@@ um@@ per s@@ tic@@ k@@ er for this view is that this is the jo@@ y of deb@@ ug@@ ging .
"Now I ’ m not going to have time to sp@@ ell it all out , but I ’ ll just say that only some kinds of deb@@ ug@@ ging get the re@@ ward ."
"And what we ’ re doing is we ’ re using hu@@ mo@@ r as a sort of neuro@@ sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic pro@@ be by s@@ wit@@ ch@@ ing hu@@ mo@@ r on and off , by turn@@ ing the kno@@ b on a jo@@ ke — now it ’ s not fun@@ ny ... o@@ h , now it ’ s fun@@ ni@@ er ..@@ ."
"@@ now we ’ ll turn a little bit more ... now it ’ s not fun@@ ny — in this way , we can actually learn something about the arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the brain , the fun@@ c@@ tional arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the brain ."
M@@ at@@ the@@ w H@@ ur@@ ley is the first au@@ th@@ or of this . We call it the H@@ ur@@ ley M@@ o@@ de@@ l .
"He ’ s a computer scient@@ ist , R@@ e@@ gin@@ al@@ d A@@ dam@@ s a psych@@ olog@@ ist , and there I am , and we ’ re p@@ ut@@ ting this together into a bo@@ ok ."
Thank you very much .
"Now , not@@ ice that the lead@@ er em@@ bra@@ ces him as an equal ."
It takes g@@ ut@@ s to st@@ and out like that .
So a movement must be publi@@ c .
Now we &apos;ve got mom@@ ent@@ um . This is the ti@@ p@@ ping point .
"And what a per@@ fect place to do that , at TE@@ D ."
( Applause )
A@@ n@@ y@@ one ?
How about a moder@@ ate amount of st@@ ress ?
Y@@ e@@ ah . M@@ e too .
But that is not my con@@ f@@ es@@ sion .
It increas@@ es the ris@@ k of everything from the common c@@ old to car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ar disease .
"But I have changed my mind about st@@ ress , and today , I want to change your@@ s ."
It &apos;s called the social st@@ ress test .
"And un@@ be@@ kno@@ w@@ n@@ st to you , the experim@@ en@@ ter has been tra@@ ined to h@@ aras@@ s you d@@ uring it ."
That guy made a mis@@ take .
It &apos;s getting more oxy@@ g@@ en to your brain .
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is inv@@ ol@@ ved in .
It fin@@ e-@@ tun@@ es your brain &apos;s social inst@@ inc@@ ts .
It even makes you more w@@ ill@@ ing to help and sup@@ port the people you care about .
But my fav@@ or@@ ite ef@@ fect on the body is actually on the heart .
People who sp@@ ent time car@@ ing for others showed absol@@ ut@@ ely no st@@ res@@ s@@ -@@ rel@@ ated increase in d@@ ying .
"And when you cho@@ ose to view st@@ ress in this way , you &apos;re not just getting better at st@@ ress , you &apos;re actually making a pretty pro@@ found stat@@ ement ."
You &apos;re saying that you can trust yourself to h@@ and@@ le life &apos;s challen@@ g@@ es .

"So that was an im@@ men@@ se sh@@ ock for me , and it was an im@@ men@@ se sh@@ ock for many people , but it was also something that , over the follo@@ wing s@@ ever@@ al days , created a complet@@ e political mel@@ t@@ down in my country ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body was bl@@ am@@ ing everybody else .
That complet@@ e mel@@ t@@ down was made even worse by the most tra@@ g@@ ic el@@ ement of it : lev@@ els of x@@ en@@ o@@ ph@@ ob@@ ia and ra@@ c@@ ist ab@@ use in the stre@@ ets of Brit@@ ain at a level that I have never seen before in my li@@ fe@@ time .
"@@ People are now talking about whether my country is becom@@ ing a L@@ it@@ tle Engl@@ and , or , as one of my colle@@ ag@@ ues put it , whether we &apos;re about to become a 19@@ 5@@ 0s nos@@ tal@@ g@@ ia the@@ me par@@ k flo@@ ating in the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) But my question is really , should we have the de@@ g@@ ree of sh@@ ock that we &apos;ve experienc@@ ed since ?"
O@@ r are there de@@ e@@ per struc@@ t@@ ural fac@@ tors that have led us to where we are today ?
So I want to take a ste@@ p back and ask two very bas@@ ic questions .
"F@@ irst , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ pres@@ ent , not just for my country , but for all of us around the world ?"
"And second , what can we do about it ?"
How should we all respon@@ d ?
"So first , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ pres@@ ent ?"
H@@ ind@@ sight is a wonderful thing .
B@@ re@@ x@@ it teach@@ es us many things about our society and about societies around the world .
"The v@@ ot@@ e s@@ pl@@ it along l@@ ines of age , education , clas@@ s and ge@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ y ."
"@@ G@@ e@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ ically , it was L@@ on@@ don and S@@ c@@ ot@@ l@@ and that most st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly com@@ mit@@ ted to being part of the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on , while in other parts of the country there was very strong amb@@ iv@@ al@@ ence ."
"But more prof@@ ou@@ nd@@ ly , the v@@ ot@@ e teach@@ es us something about the nature of polit@@ ics today ."
Con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary polit@@ ics is no longer just about right and left .
It &apos;s no longer just about ta@@ x and sp@@ end .
It &apos;s about globaliz@@ ation .
The fa@@ ult line of cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary polit@@ ics is between those that em@@ bra@@ ce globaliz@@ ation and those that fear globaliz@@ ation .
But those ideas are ones that sig@@ ni@@ f@@ y fear and ali@@ en@@ ation .
They re@@ pres@@ ent a re@@ treat back to@@ wards na@@ tion@@ al@@ ism and b@@ ord@@ ers in ways that many of us would re@@ ject .
The bl@@ ue are@@ as show R@@ e@@ ma@@ in and the red are@@ as Le@@ ave .
It means that we need to re@@ ach out more bro@@ ad@@ ly and understand .
"In the Le@@ ave v@@ ot@@ e , a min@@ or@@ ity have p@@ ed@@ dl@@ ed the polit@@ ics of fear and h@@ at@@ red , cre@@ ating lies and mis@@ trust around , for inst@@ ance , the idea that the v@@ ot@@ e on Eu@@ rop@@ e could re@@ duc@@ e the number of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es and as@@ y@@ l@@ um@@ -@@ se@@ ek@@ ers coming to Eu@@ rop@@ e , when the v@@ ot@@ e on le@@ av@@ ing had nothing to do with im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion from outside the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on ."
But for a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant ma@@ jor@@ ity of the Le@@ ave v@@ ot@@ ers the con@@ c@@ er@@ n was dis@@ ill@@ us@@ ion@@ ment with the political est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment .
This re@@ plic@@ ates around Eu@@ rop@@ e and much of the liber@@ al democra@@ tic world .
"We see it with the r@@ ise in popul@@ ar@@ ity of D@@ on@@ al@@ d Tr@@ um@@ p in the United States , with the gro@@ wing na@@ tion@@ al@@ ism of V@@ ik@@ tor O@@ r@@ b@@ á@@ n in H@@ un@@ gar@@ y , with the increase in popul@@ ar@@ ity of Mar@@ ine L@@ e P@@ en in F@@ ran@@ ce ."
The spec@@ ter of B@@ re@@ x@@ it is in all of our societies .
"For all of us who care about cre@@ ating liber@@ al , op@@ en , t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant societies , we ur@@ g@@ ently need a new vision , a vision of a more t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant , in@@ cl@@ us@@ ive globaliz@@ ation , one that br@@ ings people with us rather than le@@ av@@ ing them be@@ h@@ ind ."
That vision of globaliz@@ ation is one that has to start by a rec@@ ognition of the positive ben@@ ef@@ its of globaliz@@ ation .
"The con@@ sen@@ s@@ us amo@@ n@@ g@@ st econom@@ ists is that f@@ ree tra@@ de , the movement of cap@@ ital , the movement of people across b@@ ord@@ ers ben@@ ef@@ it everyone on ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ te ."
But globaliz@@ ation also has re@@ dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tive ef@@ fec@@ ts .
It cre@@ ates w@@ in@@ n@@ ers and l@@ os@@ ers .
"In 200@@ 2 , the form@@ er S@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ar@@ y-@@ G@@ ener@@ al of the United N@@ ations , K@@ of@@ i A@@ n@@ n@@ an , gave a spe@@ ec@@ h at Y@@ ale Un@@ iver@@ s@@ ity , and that spe@@ ec@@ h was on the to@@ p@@ ic of in@@ cl@@ us@@ ive globaliz@@ ation ."
That was the spe@@ ec@@ h in which he co@@ ined that ter@@ m .
"But ami@@ d au@@ st@@ er@@ ity and the fin@@ an@@ cial c@@ ris@@ is of 200@@ 8 , the con@@ cept di@@ sa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed almost without a tra@@ ce ."
G@@ l@@ ob@@ aliz@@ ation has been taken to sup@@ port a ne@@ ol@@ ib@@ er@@ al ag@@ en@@ da .
It &apos;s per@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed to be part of an el@@ ite ag@@ en@@ da rather than something that ben@@ ef@@ its all .
How can we bal@@ ance on the one hand ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing fear and ali@@ en@@ ation while on the other hand re@@ f@@ using ve@@ h@@ em@@ ently to give in to x@@ en@@ o@@ ph@@ ob@@ ia and na@@ tion@@ al@@ ism ?
That is the question for all of us .
"And I think , as a social scient@@ ist , that social science of@@ fer@@ s some plac@@ es to start ."
"O@@ ur trans@@ forma@@ tion has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a star@@ ting point ."
The first rel@@ ates to the idea of c@@ iv@@ ic education .
What st@@ ands out from B@@ re@@ x@@ it is the ga@@ p between publi@@ c per@@ cep@@ tion and em@@ pir@@ ical reality .
So how can we — ( Applause ) How can we reb@@ u@@ il@@ d re@@ sp@@ ect for tr@@ uth and evidence into our liber@@ al democra@@ ci@@ es ?
"It has to be@@ g@@ in with education , but it has to start with the rec@@ ognition that there are hu@@ ge g@@ aps ."
The second thing that I think is an op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity is the idea to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge more inter@@ action across d@@ iver@@ se commun@@ ities .
"So for inst@@ ance , L@@ on@@ don and the S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast have the high@@ est numbers of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts , and they are also by far the most t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant are@@ as ."
It &apos;s those are@@ as of the country that have the lo@@ w@@ est lev@@ els of im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion that actually are the most ex@@ cl@@ us@@ ion@@ ary and int@@ ol@@ er@@ ant to@@ wards mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts .
This ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tion from the F@@ in@@ an@@ cial T@@ im@@ es pos@@ t@@ -@@ B@@ re@@ x@@ it is really st@@ ri@@ king .
The f@@ our@@ th and fin@@ al idea I want to put for@@ ward is an idea that we need more responsi@@ ble polit@@ ics .
There &apos;s very little social science evidence that com@@ par@@ es at@@ tit@@ ud@@ es on globaliz@@ ation .
I am still Brit@@ ish .
I am still Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an .
I am still a global c@@ it@@ iz@@ en .
"For those of us who believe that our id@@ ent@@ ities are not m@@ ut@@ ually ex@@ cl@@ us@@ ive , we have to all work together to en@@ sure that globaliz@@ ation takes everyone with us and doesn &apos;t leave people be@@ h@@ ind ."
O@@ n@@ ly then will we truly re@@ con@@ c@@ ile democra@@ cy and globaliz@@ ation .
Thank you .
Thank you .
It &apos;s a real pleas@@ ure to be here .
I last did a TE@@ D Tal@@ k I think about seven years ago or so .
I tal@@ ked about sp@@ agh@@ et@@ ti sa@@ uc@@ e .
"And so many people , I gu@@ ess , watch those vide@@ os ."
"@@ People have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about sp@@ agh@@ et@@ ti sa@@ uc@@ e , which is a wonderful thing in the shor@@ t ter@@ m — ( Laughter ) but it &apos;s pro@@ v@@ en to be less than ide@@ al over seven years ."
And so I though I would come and try and put sp@@ agh@@ et@@ ti sa@@ uc@@ e be@@ h@@ ind me .
( Laughter ) The the@@ me of this mor@@ ning &apos;s s@@ es@@ sion is Th@@ ings We M@@ ake .
And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most pre@@ ci@@ ous ob@@ jects of his er@@ a .
And the man &apos;s na@@ me is C@@ ar@@ l Norden .
C@@ ar@@ l Norden was born in 18@@ 8@@ 0 .
And he was S@@ w@@ is@@ s .
"And of course , the S@@ w@@ is@@ s can be d@@ ivid@@ ed into two gener@@ al cat@@ eg@@ ories : those who make small , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite , exp@@ en@@ sive ob@@ jects and those who h@@ and@@ le the money of those who buy small , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite , exp@@ en@@ sive ob@@ jects ."
And C@@ ar@@ l Norden is very fir@@ m@@ ly in the form@@ er cam@@ p .
He &apos;s an engine@@ er .
He goes to the F@@ ed@@ er@@ al P@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ ec@@ h in Z@@ ur@@ ich .
"In fact , one of his clas@@ s@@ mat@@ es is a young man n@@ amed L@@ en@@ in who would go on to bre@@ ak small , exp@@ en@@ sive , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite ob@@ jects ."
"And he &apos;s a S@@ w@@ is@@ s engine@@ er , C@@ ar@@ l ."
And I mean that in its ful@@ l@@ est sense of the word .
"He we@@ ars thre@@ e-@@ piece su@@ its ; and he has a very , very small , important m@@ ust@@ ach@@ e ; and he is domin@@ e@@ er@@ ing and nar@@ c@@ is@@ sis@@ tic and driv@@ en and has an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary e@@ go ; and he works 1@@ 6@@ -@@ h@@ our days ; and he has very strong feel@@ ings about al@@ ter@@ nat@@ ing cur@@ r@@ ent ; and he fe@@ els like a s@@ un@@ tan is a sig@@ n of moral we@@ ak@@ ness ; and he dr@@ in@@ ks lots of co@@ f@@ fe@@ e ; and he does his best work sit@@ ting in his mother &apos;s k@@ it@@ ch@@ en in Z@@ ur@@ ich for h@@ ours in complet@@ e sil@@ ence with nothing but a sl@@ ide rul@@ e ."
"In any case , C@@ ar@@ l Norden e@@ mi@@ gra@@ t@@ es to the United States just before the F@@ irst World War and s@@ ets up sho@@ p on L@@ af@@ ay@@ et@@ te S@@ tre@@ et in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ tan ."
And he becom@@ es ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with the question of how to drop bomb@@ s from an air@@ plan@@ e .
"Now if you think about it , in the age before G@@ P@@ S and ra@@ da@@ r , that was ob@@ vi@@ ously a really difficult problem ."
It &apos;s a compl@@ ic@@ ated physics problem .
"You &apos;ve got a plan@@ e that &apos;s thousands of fe@@ et up in the air , going at hund@@ re@@ ds of mil@@ es an h@@ our , and you &apos;re trying to drop an ob@@ ject , a bom@@ b , to@@ wards some st@@ ati@@ on@@ ary t@@ arg@@ et in the face of all kinds of w@@ in@@ ds and cl@@ ou@@ d c@@ over and all kinds of other im@@ pe@@ dimen@@ ts ."
"And all sor@@ ts of people , mov@@ ing up to the F@@ irst World War and between the w@@ ars , tried to sol@@ ve this problem , and ne@@ arly everybody came up shor@@ t ."
The bomb@@ si@@ ghts that were av@@ a@@ il@@ able were incredi@@ bly c@@ ru@@ de .
But C@@ ar@@ l Norden is really the one who cra@@ c@@ ks the cod@@ e .
And he comes up with this incredi@@ bly compl@@ ic@@ ated dev@@ ice .
It we@@ igh@@ s about 50 l@@ b@@ s .
It &apos;s called the Norden Mar@@ k 15 bombsight .
And it has all kinds of lev@@ ers and b@@ all@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ings and ga@@ dg@@ ets and ga@@ ug@@ es .
And he makes this compl@@ ic@@ ated thing .
"And what he allo@@ ws people to do is he makes the bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ er take this particular ob@@ ject , vis@@ ually sight the t@@ arg@@ et , because they &apos;re in the P@@ le@@ x@@ ig@@ l@@ as c@@ one of the bomb@@ er , and then they pl@@ u@@ g in the al@@ tit@@ u@@ de of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the w@@ ind and the co@@ ordin@@ ates of the t@@ arg@@ et ."
And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bom@@ b .
"And as Norden famo@@ us@@ ly says , &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ fore that bombsight came along , bomb@@ s would ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely mis@@ s their t@@ arg@@ et by a mil@@ e or more . &quot; &quot; But he said , with the Mar@@ k 15 Norden bombsight , he could drop a bom@@ b into a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft ."
Now I cannot tell you how incredi@@ bly exc@@ ited the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary was by the news of the Norden bombsight .
It was like man@@ na from he@@ aven .
"@@ Here was an ar@@ my that had just had experience in the F@@ irst World War , where mil@@ lions of men f@@ ou@@ ght each other in the tr@@ en@@ ch@@ es , getting no@@ where , making no progress , and here someone had come up with a dev@@ ice that allowed them to f@@ ly up in the sk@@ ies high ab@@ ove en@@ em@@ y ter@@ rit@@ ory and des@@ tro@@ y wh@@ at@@ ever they wanted with p@@ in@@ point acc@@ ura@@ cy ."
And the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary sp@@ ends 1@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars — billion dollars in 19@@ 40 dollars — develop@@ ing the Norden bombsight .
"And to put that in per@@ spec@@ tive , the tot@@ al cost of the M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ tan project was three billion dollars ."
H@@ al@@ f as much money was sp@@ ent on this Norden bombsight as was sp@@ ent on the most famo@@ us mil@@ itar@@ y-@@ ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ al project of the modern er@@ a .
"And there were people , stra@@ te@@ g@@ ists , within the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary who gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely thought that this single dev@@ ice was going to sp@@ ell the difference between de@@ fe@@ at and vic@@ t@@ ory when it came to the b@@ at@@ tle against the N@@ az@@ is and against the Jap@@ an@@ ese ."
"And for Norden as well , this dev@@ ice had incredible moral impor@@ tan@@ ce , because Norden was a com@@ mit@@ ted Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an ."
"In fact , he would always get up@@ set when people re@@ fer@@ red to the bombsight as his inv@@ en@@ tion , because in his ey@@ es , only G@@ od could inv@@ ent things ."
He was simply the in@@ str@@ ument of G@@ od &apos;s will .
And what was G@@ od &apos;s will ?
Well G@@ od &apos;s will was that the amount of suf@@ fer@@ ing in any kind of war be re@@ duc@@ ed to as small an amount as possible .
And what did the Norden bombsight do ?
Well it allowed you to do that .
It allowed you to bom@@ b only those things that you absol@@ ut@@ ely needed and wanted to bom@@ b .
"So in the years lead@@ ing up to the S@@ econ@@ d World War , the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary bu@@ ys 9@@ 0,000 of these Norden bomb@@ si@@ ghts at a cost of $ 1@@ 4@@ ,000 each — again , in 19@@ 40 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money ."
"And they tra@@ ined 5@@ 0,000 bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers on how to use them — long ext@@ en@@ sive , mon@@ th@@ s@@ -@@ long tra@@ in@@ ing s@@ es@@ sions — because these things are essenti@@ ally anal@@ o@@ g comput@@ ers ; they &apos;re not easy to use ."
"And they make every one of those bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers take an o@@ ath , to swe@@ ar that if they &apos;re ever cap@@ tu@@ red , they will not div@@ ul@@ ge a single deta@@ il of this particular dev@@ ice to the en@@ em@@ y , because it &apos;s im@@ per@@ ative the en@@ em@@ y not get their h@@ ands on this absol@@ ut@@ ely essenti@@ al piece of technology ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever the Norden bombsight is taken on@@ to a plan@@ e , it &apos;s es@@ cor@@ ted there by a ser@@ ies of ar@@ m@@ ed gu@@ ar@@ ds ."
And it &apos;s car@@ ri@@ ed in a bo@@ x with a can@@ v@@ as sh@@ rou@@ d over it .
And the bo@@ x is h@@ and@@ c@@ uf@@ f@@ ed to one of the gu@@ ar@@ ds .
It &apos;s never allowed to be ph@@ ot@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ ed .
"And there &apos;s a little in@@ cen@@ di@@ ary dev@@ ice inside of it , so that , if the plan@@ e ever cra@@ sh@@ es , it will be des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed and there &apos;s no way the en@@ em@@ y can ever get their h@@ ands on it ."
The Norden bombsight is the H@@ ol@@ y G@@ ra@@ il .
So what happens d@@ uring the S@@ econ@@ d World War ?
"Well , it turns out it &apos;s not the H@@ ol@@ y G@@ ra@@ il ."
"In pra@@ c@@ tice , the Norden bombsight can drop a bom@@ b into a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . , but that &apos;s under per@@ fect con@@ diti@@ ons ."
"And of course , in war@@ time , con@@ diti@@ ons ar@@ en &apos;t per@@ fect ."
"F@@ irst of all , it &apos;s really hard to use — really hard to use ."
"And not all of the people who are of those 5@@ 0,000 men who are bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers have the abil@@ ity to pro@@ per@@ ly prog@@ ram an anal@@ o@@ g computer ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , it bre@@ ak@@ s down a lot ."
"It &apos;s ful@@ l of all kinds of g@@ y@@ ro@@ s@@ cop@@ es and pul@@ le@@ ys and ga@@ dg@@ ets and b@@ all@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ings , and they don &apos;t work as well as they ou@@ ght to in the he@@ at of b@@ at@@ tle ."
"Th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , when Norden was making his cal@@ cul@@ ations , he as@@ s@@ um@@ ed that a plan@@ e would be fl@@ ying at a relati@@ vely s@@ low spe@@ ed at low al@@ tit@@ ud@@ es ."
"Well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get sh@@ ot down ."
So they started fl@@ ying them at high al@@ tit@@ ud@@ es at incredi@@ bly high spe@@ ed@@ s .
And the Norden bombsight doesn &apos;t work as well under those con@@ diti@@ ons .
"But most of all , the Norden bombsight requ@@ i@@ red the bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ er to make vis@@ ual cont@@ act with the t@@ arg@@ et ."
"But of course , what happens in real life ?"
"There are cl@@ ou@@ ds , right ."
It need@@ s cl@@ ou@@ dl@@ ess sk@@ y to be really acc@@ ura@@ te .
Well how many cl@@ ou@@ dl@@ ess sk@@ ies do you think there were ab@@ ove C@@ ent@@ ral Eu@@ rop@@ e between 19@@ 40 and 19@@ 45 ?
Not a lot .
"And then to give you a sense of just how in@@ acc@@ ura@@ te the Norden bombsight was , there was a famo@@ us case in 19@@ 4@@ 4 where the Al@@ lies bomb@@ ed a chem@@ ical pl@@ ant in Le@@ un@@ a , G@@ er@@ many ."
And the chem@@ ical pl@@ ant comp@@ ris@@ ed 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ r@@ es .
"And over the course of 2@@ 2 bomb@@ ing mis@@ sions , the Al@@ lies dro@@ pped 8@@ 5@@ ,000 bomb@@ s on this 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ re chem@@ ical pl@@ ant , using the Norden bombsight ."
Well what per@@ cent@@ age of those bomb@@ s do you think actually l@@ and@@ ed inside the 7@@ 0@@ 0-@@ ac@@ re peri@@ me@@ ter of the pl@@ ant ?
10 percent . 10 percent .
"And of those 10 percent that l@@ and@@ ed , 1@@ 6 percent didn &apos;t even go off ; they were du@@ ds ."
"The Le@@ un@@ a chem@@ ical pl@@ ant , after one of the most ext@@ en@@ sive bomb@@ ings in the history of the war , was up and run@@ ning within weeks ."
"And by the way , all those prec@@ au@@ tions to keep the Norden bombsight out of the h@@ ands of the N@@ az@@ is ?"
"Well it turns out that C@@ ar@@ l Norden , as a pro@@ per S@@ w@@ is@@ s , was very en@@ amo@@ red of G@@ er@@ man engine@@ ers ."
"So in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , he h@@ i@@ red a whole bun@@ ch of them , in@@ cl@@ ud@@ ing a man n@@ amed H@@ er@@ man@@ n L@@ ong who , in 19@@ 3@@ 8 , gave a complet@@ e set of the plan@@ s for the Norden bombsight to the N@@ az@@ is ."
"So they had their own Norden bombsight throu@@ gh@@ out the enti@@ re war — which also , by the way , didn &apos;t work very well ."
( Laughter ) So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight ?
Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bomb@@ si@@ ghts .
"We live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really s@@ mart people run@@ ning around , saying that they &apos;ve inv@@ ent@@ ed ga@@ dg@@ ets that will forever change our world ."
They &apos;ve inv@@ ent@@ ed w@@ eb@@ sit@@ es that will allow people to be f@@ ree .
"They &apos;ve inv@@ ent@@ ed some kind of this thing , or this thing , or this thing that will make our world forever better ."
"If you go into the mil@@ it@@ ary , you &apos;ll find lots of C@@ ar@@ l N@@ or@@ den@@ s as well ."
"If you go to the P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on , they will say , &quot; &quot; You know what , now we really can put a bom@@ b inside a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . &quot; &quot; And you know what , it &apos;s true ; they actually can do that now ."
But we need to be very c@@ lear about how little that means .
"In the I@@ ra@@ q War , at the beginning of the first I@@ ra@@ q War , the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary , the air force , s@@ ent two squ@@ ad@@ rons of F@@ -@@ 1@@ 5@@ E F@@ igh@@ ter E@@ ag@@ les to the I@@ ra@@ q@@ i des@@ ert equ@@ ip@@ ped with these five million doll@@ ar c@@ amer@@ as that allowed them to see the enti@@ re des@@ ert flo@@ or ."
"And their mis@@ sion was to find and to des@@ tro@@ y — remem@@ ber the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ s@@ ile la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers , those sur@@ fac@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ air mis@@ sil@@ es that the I@@ ra@@ q@@ is were la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing at the I@@ s@@ ra@@ elis ?"
The mis@@ sion of the two squ@@ ad@@ rons was to get ri@@ d of all the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ s@@ ile la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers .
"And so they fle@@ w mis@@ sions day and ni@@ ght , and they dro@@ pped thousands of bomb@@ s , and they fi@@ red thousands of mis@@ sil@@ es in an att@@ emp@@ t to get ri@@ d of this particular s@@ cour@@ ge ."
"And after the war was over , there was an au@@ dit done — as the ar@@ my always does , the air force always does — and they asked the question : how many S@@ cu@@ ds did we actually des@@ tro@@ y ?"
You know what the answer was ?
"@@ Z@@ ero , not a single one ."
Now why is that ?
I@@ s it because their we@@ ap@@ ons wer@@ en &apos;t acc@@ ura@@ te ?
"O@@ h no , they were br@@ il@@ lian@@ tly acc@@ ura@@ te ."
"They could have des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed this little thing right here from 2@@ 5@@ ,000 ft ."
The issue was they didn &apos;t know where the S@@ cu@@ d la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers were .
"The problem with bomb@@ s and pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ r@@ els is not getting the bom@@ b inside the pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l , it &apos;s kno@@ wing how to find the pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l ."
That &apos;s always been the har@@ der problem when it comes to f@@ igh@@ ting w@@ ars .
O@@ r take the b@@ at@@ tle in A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan .
What is the sig@@ nature we@@ ap@@ on of the C@@ I@@ A &apos;s war in N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est P@@ ak@@ istan ?
It &apos;s the d@@ ron@@ e . What is the d@@ ron@@ e ?
Well it is the grand@@ son of the Norden Mar@@ k 15 bombsight .
It is this we@@ ap@@ on of dev@@ ast@@ ating acc@@ ura@@ cy and prec@@ is@@ ion .
"And over the course of the last six years in N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est P@@ ak@@ istan , the C@@ I@@ A has flo@@ wn hund@@ re@@ ds of d@@ ron@@ e mis@@ sil@@ es , and it &apos;s used those d@@ ron@@ es to k@@ ill 2@@ ,000 sus@@ p@@ ec@@ ted P@@ ak@@ ist@@ ani and Tal@@ ib@@ an mil@@ it@@ an@@ ts ."
Now what is the acc@@ ura@@ cy of those d@@ ron@@ es ?
Well it &apos;s ex@@ tra@@ ordinary .
We think we &apos;re now at 9@@ 5 percent acc@@ ura@@ cy when it comes to d@@ ron@@ e st@@ ri@@ k@@ es .
"@@ 9@@ 5 percent of the people we k@@ ill need to be kil@@ led , right ?"
That is one of the most ex@@ tra@@ ordinary rec@@ or@@ ds in the history of modern war@@ f@@ are .
But do you know what the c@@ ru@@ cial thing is ?
"In that ex@@ act same peri@@ od that we &apos;ve been using these d@@ ron@@ es with dev@@ ast@@ ating acc@@ ura@@ cy , the number of att@@ ac@@ ks , of su@@ ic@@ ide att@@ ac@@ ks and ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ t att@@ ac@@ ks , against American for@@ ces in A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan has increas@@ ed t@@ en@@ f@@ old ."
"As we have g@@ ot@@ ten more and more ef@@ fici@@ ent in kil@@ l@@ ing them , they have become ang@@ ri@@ er and ang@@ ri@@ er and more and more mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated to k@@ ill us ."
I have not describ@@ ed to you a success story .
I &apos;ve describ@@ ed to you the op@@ pos@@ ite of a success story .
And this is the problem with our in@@ f@@ at@@ u@@ ation with the things we make .
"We think the things we make can sol@@ ve our problems , but our problems are much more compl@@ e@@ x than that ."
"The issue isn &apos;t the acc@@ ura@@ cy of the bomb@@ s you have , it &apos;s how you use the bomb@@ s you have , and more impor@@ tan@@ tly , whether you ou@@ ght to use bomb@@ s at all ."
There &apos;s a pos@@ ts@@ cri@@ p@@ t to the Norden story of C@@ ar@@ l Norden and his f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous bombsight .
"And that is , on A@@ ug@@ ust 6 , 19@@ 45 , a B@@ -@@ 2@@ 9 bomb@@ er called the En@@ ol@@ a G@@ ay fle@@ w over Japan and , using a Norden bombsight , dro@@ pped a very large ther@@ mon@@ uc@@ lear dev@@ ice on the c@@ ity of H@@ iro@@ sh@@ im@@ a ."
"And as was typ@@ ical with the Norden bombsight , the bom@@ b actually mis@@ sed its t@@ arg@@ et by 8@@ 00 ft ."
"But of course , it didn &apos;t matter ."
And that &apos;s the gre@@ at@@ est i@@ ron@@ y of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight .
"@@ the air force &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 5 billion doll@@ ar bombsight was used to drop its three billion doll@@ ar bom@@ b , which didn &apos;t need a bombsight at all ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , back in New Y@@ or@@ k , no one told C@@ ar@@ l Norden that his bombsight was used over H@@ iro@@ sh@@ im@@ a ."

"( Applause ) M@@ al@@ ala started her cam@@ pa@@ ign for education and st@@ ood for her ri@@ ghts in 200@@ 7 , and when her ef@@ for@@ ts were hon@@ or@@ ed in 20@@ 1@@ 1 , and she was giv@@ en the national y@@ ou@@ th pe@@ ace pri@@ ze , and she bec@@ ame a very famo@@ us , very popul@@ ar young girl of her country ."
"B@@ e@@ fore that , she was my daughter , but now I am her father ."
"@@ L@@ a@@ di@@ es and g@@ ent@@ l@@ em@@ en , if we gl@@ ance to human history , the story of women is the story of in@@ j@@ us@@ tice , inequ@@ ality , violence and expl@@ o@@ itation ."
"You see , in pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ al societies , right from the very beginning , when a girl is born , her bir@@ th is not cel@@ eb@@ ra@@ ted ."
"She is not w@@ el@@ com@@ ed , nei@@ ther by father n@@ or by mother ."
"The ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood comes and com@@ mis@@ er@@ ates with the mother , and nob@@ ody con@@ gra@@ tul@@ ates the father ."
And a mother is very un@@ com@@ for@@ table for having a girl child .
"When she giv@@ es bir@@ th to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sad ."
"When she giv@@ es bir@@ th to the second daughter , she is sh@@ oc@@ ked , and in the expec@@ t@@ ation of a son , when she giv@@ es bir@@ th to a th@@ ir@@ d daughter , she fe@@ els gu@@ il@@ ty like a cri@@ min@@ al ."
"@@ Not only the mother suf@@ fer@@ s , but the daughter , the new@@ ly born daughter , when she gro@@ ws old , she suf@@ fer@@ s too ."
"A@@ t the age of five , while she should be going to school , she st@@ a@@ ys at home and her bro@@ thers are ad@@ mit@@ ted in a school ."
She can have fu@@ n .
"She can pl@@ ay with her friends in the stre@@ ets , and she can move around in the stre@@ ets like a b@@ ut@@ ter@@ f@@ ly ."
"But when she ent@@ ers her te@@ ens , when she becom@@ es 1@@ 3 years old , she is for@@ b@@ id@@ den to go out of her home without a mal@@ e es@@ cor@@ t ."
She is con@@ fin@@ ed under the four w@@ all@@ s of her home .
She is no more a f@@ ree individ@@ ual .
"She becom@@ es the so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or of her father and of her bro@@ thers and of her family , and if she trans@@ g@@ res@@ ses the cod@@ e of that so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or , she could even be kil@@ led ."
"So this bro@@ ther , he sa@@ cri@@ fic@@ es the jo@@ ys of his life and the happiness of his s@@ ist@@ ers at the al@@ t@@ ar of so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or ."
"A good girl is sup@@ posed to be very qu@@ iet , very hum@@ ble and very sub@@ mis@@ sive ."
It is the c@@ rit@@ eria .
The ro@@ le mo@@ de@@ l good girl should be very qu@@ iet .
"She is sup@@ posed to be sil@@ ent and she is sup@@ posed to ac@@ cept the dec@@ is@@ ions of her father and mother and the dec@@ is@@ ions of el@@ d@@ ers , even if she does not like them ."
"If she is marri@@ ed to a man she doesn &apos;t like or if she is marri@@ ed to an old man , she has to ac@@ cept , because she does not want to be d@@ ub@@ b@@ ed as dis@@ ob@@ e@@ di@@ ent ."
"If she is marri@@ ed very early , she has to ac@@ cept ."
"O@@ ther@@ w@@ ise , she will be called dis@@ ob@@ e@@ di@@ ent ."
And what happens at the end ?
"In the words of a po@@ et@@ ess , she is wed@@ ded , bed@@ ded , and then she giv@@ es bir@@ th to more s@@ ons and dau@@ gh@@ ters ."
"And it is the i@@ ron@@ y of the sit@@ u@@ ation that this mother , she teach@@ es the same les@@ son of ob@@ e@@ di@@ ence to her daughter and the same les@@ son of hon@@ or to her s@@ ons ."
"And this vic@@ i@@ ous c@@ y@@ cle goes on , goes on ."
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and s@@ ist@@ ers , when M@@ al@@ ala was born , and for the first time , believe me , I don &apos;t like new@@ born children , to be hon@@ est , but when I went and I looked into her ey@@ es , believe me , I got extre@@ m@@ ely hon@@ or@@ ed ."
"And long before she was born , I thought about her na@@ me , and I was fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated with a her@@ o@@ ic le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y fre@@ ed@@ om f@@ igh@@ ter in A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan ."
"H@@ er na@@ me was M@@ al@@ al@@ ai of M@@ ai@@ w@@ and , and I n@@ amed my daughter after her ."
"A few days after M@@ al@@ ala was born , my daughter was born , my cou@@ s@@ in came — and it was a co@@ inc@@ idence — he came to my home and he b@@ rou@@ ght a family tree , a family tree of the Y@@ ou@@ saf@@ z@@ ai family , and when I looked at the family tree , it trac@@ ed back to 3@@ 00 years of our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors ."
"But when I looked , all were men , and I pic@@ ked my p@@ en , dre@@ w a line from my na@@ me , and w@@ ro@@ te , &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ ala . &quot; &quot; And when she grow old , when she was four and a half years old , I ad@@ mit@@ ted her in my school ."
"You will be asking , then , why should I men@@ tion about the ad@@ mis@@ sion of a girl in a school ?"
"@@ Y@@ es , I must men@@ tion it ."
"It may be taken for gr@@ an@@ ted in C@@ an@@ ada , in America , in many developed countries , but in poor countries , in pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ al societies , in trib@@ al societies , it &apos;s a big ev@@ ent for the life of girl ."
En@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ ment in a school means rec@@ ognition of her id@@ ent@@ ity and her na@@ me .
A@@ d@@ mis@@ sion in a school means that she has en@@ tered the world of dre@@ ams and as@@ pira@@ tions where she can expl@@ ore her p@@ ot@@ enti@@ als for her future life .
"I have five s@@ ist@@ ers , and n@@ one of them could go to school , and you will be ast@@ on@@ i@@ shed , two weeks before , when I was fil@@ l@@ ing out the C@@ an@@ a@@ dian v@@ isa form , and I was fil@@ l@@ ing out the family part of the form , I could not rec@@ all the sur@@ nam@@ es of some of my s@@ ist@@ ers ."
That was the reason that I val@@ u@@ ed my daughter .
"What my father could not give to my s@@ ist@@ ers and to his dau@@ gh@@ ters , I thought I must change it ."
I used to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate the intelligence and the br@@ il@@ li@@ ance of my daughter .
I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed her to s@@ it with me when my friends used to come .
I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed her to go with me to different me@@ et@@ ings .
"And all these good val@@ ues , I tried to in@@ cul@@ c@@ ate in her person@@ ality ."
"And this was not only she , only M@@ al@@ ala ."
"I im@@ par@@ ted all these good val@@ ues to my school , girl students and bo@@ y students as well ."
I used education for em@@ an@@ ci@@ p@@ ation .
"I t@@ au@@ ght my girls , I t@@ au@@ ght my girl students , to un@@ learn the les@@ son of ob@@ e@@ di@@ ence ."
I t@@ au@@ ght my bo@@ y students to un@@ learn the les@@ son of so@@ -@@ called p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ hon@@ or .
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and s@@ ist@@ ers , we were str@@ iv@@ ing for more ri@@ ghts for women , and we were str@@ ug@@ gl@@ ing to have more , more and more space for the women in society ."
But we came across a new ph@@ enom@@ en@@ on .
It was le@@ th@@ al to human ri@@ ghts and particul@@ arly to women &apos;s ri@@ ghts .
It was called Tal@@ ib@@ an@@ iz@@ ation .
"It means a complet@@ e nega@@ tion of women &apos;s parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation in all political , econom@@ ical and social acti@@ v@@ ities ."
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of schools were lost .
G@@ ir@@ ls were pro@@ h@@ ib@@ ited from going to school .
W@@ omen were for@@ ced to we@@ ar ve@@ ils and they were st@@ op@@ ped from going to the market@@ s .
"M@@ us@@ ici@@ ans were sil@@ enc@@ ed , girls were f@@ log@@ g@@ ed and sing@@ ers were kil@@ led ."
"She w@@ ro@@ te a di@@ ary for the B@@ B@@ C blo@@ g , she vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed her@@ self for the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ar@@ ies , and she sp@@ o@@ ke from every pl@@ at@@ form she could ."
And her vo@@ ice was the most po@@ wer@@ ful vo@@ ice .
It sp@@ read like a c@@ res@@ cen@@ do all around the world .
"And that was the reason the Tal@@ ib@@ an could not t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate her cam@@ pa@@ ign , and on O@@ c@@ t@@ ob@@ er 9 20@@ 12 , she was sh@@ ot in the head at point bl@@ ank ran@@ ge ."
It was a do@@ om@@ s@@ day for my family and for me .
The world turned into a big black h@@ ole .
"Wh@@ ile my daughter was on the ver@@ ge of life and de@@ ath , I wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the e@@ ars of my wife , &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ould I be bl@@ amed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter ? &quot; &quot; And she ab@@ r@@ up@@ tly told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase don &apos;t bl@@ ame yourself ."
You st@@ ood for the right cause .
"You put your life at st@@ ake for the cause of tr@@ uth , for the cause of pe@@ ace , and for the cause of education , and your daughter in in@@ sp@@ i@@ red from you and she jo@@ ined you ."
"You both were on the right pat@@ h and G@@ od will pro@@ t@@ ect her . &quot; &quot; These few words me@@ ant a lot to me , and I didn &apos;t ask this question again ."
"When M@@ al@@ ala was in the h@@ os@@ p@@ ital , and she was going through the s@@ ev@@ ere pain@@ s and she had had s@@ ev@@ ere he@@ ada@@ ch@@ es because her f@@ aci@@ al ner@@ ve was c@@ ut down , I used to see a dark sh@@ ad@@ ow sp@@ read@@ ing on the face of my wife ."
But my daughter never compl@@ ained .
"She used to tell us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m fin@@ e with my c@@ ro@@ o@@ ked s@@ mil@@ e and with my numb@@ ness in my face ."
"I &apos;ll be ok@@ ay . P@@ le@@ ase don &apos;t wor@@ ry . &quot; &quot; She was a sol@@ ace for us , and she con@@ sol@@ ed us ."
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and s@@ ist@@ ers , we learned from her how to be res@@ il@@ i@@ ent in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m gl@@ ad to share with you that des@@ p@@ ite being an ic@@ on for the ri@@ ghts of children and women , she is like any 1@@ 6@@ -@@ year old girl ."
She cri@@ es when her h@@ ome@@ work is in@@ complet@@ e .
"She qu@@ ar@@ r@@ els with her bro@@ thers , and I am very happy for that ."
"@@ People ask me , what speci@@ al is in my m@@ ent@@ or@@ ship which has made M@@ al@@ ala so b@@ old and so cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous and so v@@ oc@@ al and po@@ ised ?"
"I tell them , don &apos;t ask me what I did ."
A@@ s@@ k me what I did not do .
"I did not cli@@ p her w@@ ings , and that &apos;s all ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk to you today about h@@ o@@ pe@@ fully con@@ v@@ ert@@ ing fear into hop@@ e .
"When we go to the physic@@ ian today — when we go to the doc@@ tor &apos;s of@@ fic@@ e and we wal@@ k in , there are words that we just don &apos;t want to hear ."
There are words that we &apos;re truly af@@ ra@@ id of .
"D@@ i@@ ab@@ et@@ es , can@@ cer , P@@ ar@@ kin@@ son &apos;s , Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s , heart fail@@ ure , l@@ un@@ g fail@@ ure — things that we know are deb@@ il@@ it@@ ating dis@@ eas@@ es , for which there &apos;s relati@@ vely little that can be done ."
"And what I want to la@@ y out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat deb@@ il@@ it@@ ating disease , why it &apos;s important , why without it perhaps our health care system will mel@@ t down if you think it already h@@ as@@ n &apos;t , and where we are cl@@ in@@ ically today , and where we might go to@@ mor@@ row , and what some of the h@@ ur@@ dl@@ es are ."
"And we &apos;re going to do all of that in 1@@ 8 minutes , I p@@ rom@@ ise ."
"I want to start with this sl@@ ide , because this sl@@ ide sort of t@@ ells the story the way S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ aga@@ z@@ ine thin@@ ks of it ."
This was an issue from 200@@ 2 that they published with a lot of different ar@@ ti@@ cles on the bi@@ on@@ ic human .
It was basically a regener@@ ative medicine issue .
R@@ e@@ gener@@ ative medicine is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily simple con@@ cept that everybody can understand .
It &apos;s simply acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating the p@@ ace at which the body he@@ als itself to a cl@@ in@@ ically rel@@ ev@@ ant tim@@ es@@ cal@@ e .
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .
"We know that if we have a da@@ mag@@ ed h@@ i@@ p , you can put an ar@@ ti@@ fici@@ al h@@ i@@ p in ."
And this is the idea that S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ aga@@ z@@ ine used on their fron@@ t c@@ over .
This is the complet@@ e an@@ ti@@ th@@ esis of regener@@ ative medicine .
This is not regener@@ ative medicine .
R@@ e@@ gener@@ ative medicine is what B@@ usiness W@@ e@@ e@@ k put up when they did a story about regener@@ ative medicine not too long ago .
"The idea is that instead of fig@@ uring out how to am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms with dev@@ ices and dru@@ gs and the like — and I &apos;ll come back to that the@@ me a few times — instead of doing that , we will regener@@ ate lost fun@@ c@@ tion of the body by regener@@ ating the fun@@ c@@ tion of organ@@ s and da@@ mag@@ ed t@@ issue ."
"So that at the end of the treat@@ ment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treat@@ ment ."
V@@ ery few good ideas — if you ag@@ ree that this is a good idea — very few good ideas are truly nov@@ el .
And this is just the same .
"If you look back in history , Ch@@ ar@@ les L@@ ind@@ ber@@ gh , who was better known for fl@@ ying air@@ plan@@ es , was actually one of the first people along with A@@ le@@ x@@ is C@@ ar@@ re@@ l , one of the N@@ ob@@ el Lau@@ re@@ ates from R@@ oc@@ k@@ ef@@ ell@@ er , to be@@ g@@ in to think about , could you culture organ@@ s ?"
"And they published this bo@@ ok in 19@@ 3@@ 7 , where they actually be@@ gan to think about , what could you do in bi@@ o-@@ re@@ ac@@ tors to grow whole organ@@ s ?"
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
I &apos;m going to share with you some of the exc@@ iting work that &apos;s going on .
"But before doing that , what I &apos;d like to do is share my depres@@ sion about the health care system and the need for this with you ."
"M@@ any of the tal@@ ks y@@ es@@ ter@@ day tal@@ ked about impro@@ v@@ ing the qu@@ ality of life , and re@@ duc@@ ing pov@@ erty , and essenti@@ ally increas@@ ing life expec@@ tan@@ cy all around the glob@@ e ."
"One of the challen@@ g@@ es is that the ri@@ ch@@ er we are , the longer we live ."
"And the longer we live , the more exp@@ en@@ sive it is to take care of our dis@@ eas@@ es as we get ol@@ der ."
This is simply the we@@ al@@ th of a country ver@@ s@@ us the percent of population over the age of 6@@ 5 .
"And you can basically see that the ri@@ ch@@ er a country is , the ol@@ der the people are within it ."
Why is this important ?
And why is this a particul@@ arly dra@@ ma@@ tic challenge right now ?
"If the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a bro@@ ken an@@ k@@ le every now and again , maybe a little bit of as@@ th@@ ma ."
"If the average age in your country is 45 to 5@@ 5 , now the average person is looking at diab@@ et@@ es , ear@@ l@@ y-@@ on@@ set diab@@ et@@ es , heart fail@@ ure , co@@ ron@@ ary art@@ ery disease — things that are in@@ her@@ ently more difficult to treat , and much more exp@@ en@@ sive to treat ."
Just have a look at the demo@@ gra@@ ph@@ ics in the U.S. here .
"This is from &quot; &quot; The Un@@ ti@@ ed States of America . &quot; &quot; In 19@@ 30 , there were 4@@ 1 work@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree ."
"@@ 4@@ 1 people who were basically outside of being really sic@@ k , pa@@ ying for the one re@@ ti@@ ree who was experiencing deb@@ il@@ it@@ ating disease ."
"In 20@@ 10 , two work@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree in the U.S@@ ."
"And this is mat@@ ched in every ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ aliz@@ ed , we@@ al@@ thy country in the world ."
How can you actually af@@ for@@ d to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?
This is age ver@@ s@@ us cost of health care .
"And you can see that right around age 45 , 40 to 45 , there &apos;s a su@@ d@@ den sp@@ ik@@ e in the cost of health care ."
"It &apos;s actually quite interesting . I@@ f you do the right studies , you can look at how much you as an individ@@ ual sp@@ end on your own health care , pl@@ ot@@ ted over your li@@ fe@@ time ."
"And about seven years before you &apos;re about to di@@ e , there &apos;s a sp@@ ik@@ e ."
And you can actually — ( Laughter ) — we won &apos;t get into that . ( Laughter )
"There are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of dis@@ eas@@ es and experience what I would call heal@@ thy ag@@ ing ."
"I &apos;d su@@ g@@ gest there are four things , and n@@ one of these things in@@ cl@@ u@@ de an in@@ sur@@ ance system or a le@@ ga@@ l system ."
A@@ ll those things do is change who pa@@ ys .
They don &apos;t actually change what the ac@@ tu@@ al cost of the treat@@ ment is .
One thing you can do is not treat . You can ra@@ tion health care .
We won &apos;t talk about that any@@ more . It &apos;s too depres@@ sing .
You can pre@@ v@@ ent .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously a lot of mo@@ ni@@ es should be put into pre@@ ven@@ tion .
"But perhaps most interesting , to me any@@ way , and most important , is the idea of diag@@ nos@@ ing a disease much ear@@ li@@ er on in the progres@@ sion , and then tre@@ ating the disease to c@@ ure the disease instead of tre@@ ating a sym@@ p@@ tom ."
"Th@@ ink of it in terms of diab@@ et@@ es , for inst@@ ance ."
"@@ To@@ day , with diab@@ et@@ es , what do we do ?"
"We diag@@ n@@ ose the disease ev@@ ent@@ ually , once it becom@@ es sym@@ p@@ to@@ ma@@ tic , and then we treat the sym@@ p@@ tom for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years ."
And we do O@@ K . In@@ sul@@ in &apos;s a pretty good ther@@ ap@@ y .
"But ev@@ ent@@ ually it st@@ op@@ s working , and diab@@ et@@ es lead@@ s to a predic@@ table on@@ set of deb@@ il@@ it@@ ating disease ."
"Wh@@ y c@@ ouldn &apos;t we just in@@ ject the pan@@ cre@@ as with something to regener@@ ate the pan@@ cre@@ as early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was sym@@ p@@ to@@ ma@@ tic ?"
"And it might be a little bit exp@@ en@@ sive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would truly be able to do something different ."
"This video , I think , gets across the con@@ cept that I &apos;m talking about quite dra@@ ma@@ tically ."
This is a new@@ t re@@ -@@ gro@@ wing its lim@@ b .
"If a new@@ t can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?"
I &apos;ll actually show you some more important fe@@ atures about lim@@ b regener@@ ation in a moment .
"But what we &apos;re talking about in regener@@ ative medicine is doing this in every or@@ gan system of the body , for t@@ issu@@ es and for organ@@ s themselves ."
"So today &apos;s reality is that if we get sic@@ k , the message is we will treat your sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms , and you need to ad@@ just to a new way of life ."
"I would pose to you that to@@ mor@@ row — and when to@@ mor@@ row is we could deb@@ ate , but it &apos;s within the for@@ es@@ e@@ e@@ able future — we will talk about regener@@ ative re@@ h@@ abil@@ itation ."
"There &apos;s a lim@@ b pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic up here , si@@ mil@@ ar actually one on the sol@@ di@@ er that &apos;s come back from I@@ ra@@ q ."
There are 3@@ 70 sol@@ di@@ ers that have come back from I@@ ra@@ q that have lost lim@@ b@@ s .
"I@@ mag@@ ine if instead of fac@@ ing that , they could actually face the regener@@ ation of that lim@@ b ."
It &apos;s a w@@ il@@ d con@@ cept .
I &apos;ll show you where we are at the moment in working to@@ wards that con@@ cept .
"But it &apos;s ap@@ plic@@ able , again , to every or@@ gan system ."
How can we do that ?
The way to do that is to devel@@ op a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the body .
We need to learn to speak the body &apos;s language .
And to s@@ wit@@ ch on proc@@ ess@@ es that we knew how to do when we were a f@@ et@@ us .
"A mam@@ mal@@ ian f@@ et@@ us , if it l@@ os@@ es a lim@@ b d@@ uring the first tri@@ mes@@ ter of pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy , will re@@ -@@ grow that lim@@ b ."
So our D@@ N@@ A has the cap@@ ac@@ ity to do these kinds of w@@ ou@@ nd@@ -@@ heal@@ ing me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms .
"It &apos;s a natural process , but it is lost as we age ."
"In a child , before the age of about six months , if they l@@ ose their f@@ ing@@ erti@@ p in an acc@@ ident , they &apos;ll re@@ -@@ grow their f@@ ing@@ erti@@ p ."
"B@@ y the time they &apos;re five , they won &apos;t be able to do that any@@ more ."
"So to en@@ ga@@ ge in that con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the body , we need to speak the body &apos;s language ."
And there are certain to@@ ols in our to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x that allow us to do this today .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of three of these to@@ ols through which to con@@ ver@@ se with the body .
The first is c@@ ell@@ ul@@ ar ther@@ ap@@ ies .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , we he@@ al ourselves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work ."
"Th@@ ere@@ fore , if we can find the right cells and im@@ pl@@ ant them in the body , they may do the heal@@ ing ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , we can use materi@@ als ."
We heard y@@ es@@ ter@@ day about the impor@@ tan@@ ce of new materi@@ als .
"If we can inv@@ ent materi@@ als , des@@ ign materi@@ als , or ex@@ trac@@ t materi@@ als from a natural environ@@ ment , then we might be able to have those materi@@ als in@@ duc@@ e the body to he@@ al itself ."
"And finally , we may be able to use s@@ mart dev@@ ices that will of@@ flo@@ ad the work of the body and allow it to he@@ al ."
"I &apos;m going to show you an example of each of these , and I &apos;m going to start with materi@@ als ."
St@@ eve B@@ ad@@ y@@ la@@ k — who &apos;s at the Un@@ iver@@ s@@ ity of P@@ it@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh — about a dec@@ ad@@ e ago had a re@@ mark@@ able idea .
"And that idea was that the small int@@ est@@ ine of a pi@@ g , if you thre@@ w away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to re@@ ma@@ in bi@@ olog@@ ically ac@@ tive , may con@@ tain all of the nec@@ ess@@ ary fac@@ tors and signals that would sign@@ al the body to he@@ al itself ."
And he asked a very important question .
"He asked the question , if I take that material , which is a natural material that us@@ ually in@@ duc@@ es heal@@ ing in the small int@@ est@@ ine , and I place it some@@ where else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a t@@ issu@@ e-@@ spec@@ if@@ ic respon@@ se , or would it make small int@@ est@@ ine if I tried to make a new e@@ ar ?"
I wouldn &apos;t be telling you this story if it wer@@ en &apos;t comp@@ elling .
The picture I &apos;m about to show you is a comp@@ elling picture .
"( Laughter ) H@@ ow@@ ever , for those of you that are even the s@@ li@@ gh@@ test bit squ@@ e@@ am@@ ish — even though you may not like to ad@@ mit it in fron@@ t of your friends — the li@@ ghts are down . This is a good time to look at your fe@@ et , ch@@ ec@@ k your B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ ry , do anything other than look at the scre@@ en . ( Laughter )"
What I &apos;m about to show you is a diab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ cer .
And al@@ though — it &apos;s good to l@@ au@@ gh before we look at this .
This is the reality of diab@@ et@@ es .
"I think a lot of times we hear about diab@@ e@@ tics , diab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , we just don &apos;t con@@ n@@ ect the ul@@ cer with the ev@@ ent@@ ual treat@@ ment , which is am@@ p@@ ut@@ ation , if you can &apos;t he@@ al it ."
So I &apos;m going to put the sl@@ ide up now . It won &apos;t be up for long .
This is a diab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ cer . It &apos;s tra@@ g@@ ic .
The treat@@ ment for this is am@@ p@@ ut@@ ation .
"This is an ol@@ der l@@ ad@@ y . She has can@@ cer of the li@@ ver as well as diab@@ et@@ es , and has decided to di@@ e with what &apos; s left of her body int@@ act ."
"And this l@@ ad@@ y decided , after a year of att@@ emp@@ ted treat@@ ment of that ul@@ cer , that she would try this new ther@@ ap@@ y that St@@ eve inv@@ ent@@ ed ."
That &apos;s what the w@@ ound looked like 1@@ 1 weeks later .
That material cont@@ ained only natural signals .
And that material in@@ duc@@ ed the body to s@@ wit@@ ch back on a heal@@ ing respon@@ se that it didn &apos;t have before .
There &apos;s going to be a couple more dis@@ t@@ res@@ sing sl@@ id@@ es for those of you — I &apos;ll let you know when you can look again .
This is a hor@@ se . The hor@@ se is not in pain .
"If the hor@@ se was in pain , I wouldn &apos;t show you this sl@@ ide ."
The hor@@ se just has another nos@@ tri@@ l that &apos;s developed because of a r@@ id@@ ing acc@@ ident .
"@@ Just a few weeks after treat@@ ment — in this case , tak@@ ing that material , turn@@ ing it into a g@@ el , and p@@ ac@@ king that are@@ a , and then re@@ pe@@ ating the treat@@ ment a few times — and the hor@@ se he@@ als up ."
"And if you took an ul@@ tra@@ sound of that are@@ a , it would look great ."
Here &apos;s a dol@@ ph@@ in where the f@@ in &apos;s been re@@ -@@ att@@ ach@@ ed .
"There are now 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 patients around the world who have used that material to he@@ al their w@@ oun@@ ds ."
C@@ ould you regener@@ ate a lim@@ b ?
D@@ A@@ R@@ P@@ A just gave St@@ eve 15 million dollars to le@@ ad an e@@ igh@@ t@@ -@@ inst@@ it@@ ution project to be@@ g@@ in the process of asking that question .
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million doll@@ ar picture .
This is a 7@@ 8 ye@@ ar-@@ old man who &apos;s lost the end of his f@@ ing@@ erti@@ p .
R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber that I men@@ tion@@ ed before the children who l@@ ose their f@@ ing@@ erti@@ ps .
A@@ f@@ ter treat@@ ment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is cl@@ in@@ ically rel@@ ev@@ ant today .
There are materi@@ als that do this . Here are the heart pat@@ ch@@ es .
But could you go a little f@@ ur@@ ther ?
"C@@ ould you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and re@@ move a da@@ mag@@ ed piece of t@@ issue , put a bi@@ o-@@ de@@ gra@@ da@@ ble material on there ?"
You can see here a little bit of heart mus@@ cle be@@ ating in a dis@@ h .
This was done by Ter@@ u@@ o O@@ kan@@ o at To@@ k@@ y@@ o W@@ omen &apos;s H@@ os@@ p@@ ital .
He can actually grow be@@ ating t@@ issue in a dis@@ h .
"He chil@@ ls the dis@@ h , it changes its pro@@ per@@ ties and he pe@@ els it right out of the dis@@ h ."
It &apos;s the co@@ ol@@ est stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you c@@ ell-@@ based regener@@ ation .
And what I &apos;m going to show you here is stem cells being re@@ mov@@ ed from the h@@ i@@ p of a pati@@ ent .
"A@@ ga@@ in , if you &apos;re squ@@ e@@ am@@ ish , you don &apos;t want to watch ."
But this one &apos;s kind of co@@ ol .
"So this is a b@@ y@@ pas@@ s oper@@ ation , just like what A@@ l G@@ ore had , with a difference ."
"In this case , at the end of the b@@ y@@ pas@@ s oper@@ ation , you &apos;re going to see the stem cells from the pati@@ ent that were re@@ mov@@ ed at the beginning of the proc@@ ed@@ ure being in@@ jec@@ ted direc@@ tly into the heart of the pati@@ ent ."
And I &apos;m st@@ anding up here because at one point I &apos;m going to show you just how early this technology is .
"@@ Here go the stem cells , right into the be@@ ating heart of the pati@@ ent ."
"And if you look really c@@ are@@ fully , it &apos;s going to be right around this point you &apos;ll actually see a bac@@ k@@ -@@ fl@@ ush ."
You see the cells coming back out .
"We need all sor@@ ts of new technology , new dev@@ ices , to get the cells to the right place at the right time ."
"@@ Just a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data ."
This was a ran@@ do@@ miz@@ ed tri@@ al .
A@@ t this time this was an N of 20 . Now there &apos;s an N of about 100 .
"B@@ as@@ ically , if you take an extre@@ m@@ ely sic@@ k pati@@ ent and you give them a b@@ y@@ pas@@ s , they get a little bit better ."
"If you give them stem cells as well as their b@@ y@@ pas@@ s , for these particular patients , they bec@@ ame as@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ to@@ ma@@ tic ."
These are now two years out .
"The co@@ ol@@ est thing would be is if you could diag@@ n@@ ose the disease early , and pre@@ v@@ ent the on@@ set of the disease to a bad state ."
"This is the same proc@@ ed@@ ure , but now done min@@ im@@ ally inv@@ as@@ iv@@ ely , with only three hol@@ es in the body where they &apos;re tak@@ ing the heart and simply in@@ jec@@ ting stem cells through a l@@ apar@@ os@@ cop@@ ic proc@@ ed@@ ure ."
There go the cells .
"We don &apos;t have time to go into all of those deta@@ ils , but basically , that works too ."
"You can take patients who are less sic@@ k , and bring them back to an almost as@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ to@@ ma@@ tic state through that kind of ther@@ ap@@ y ."
"@@ Here &apos;s another example of st@@ em@@ -@@ cell ther@@ ap@@ y that isn &apos;t quite cl@@ in@@ ical yet , but I think very so@@ on will be ."
"This is the work of K@@ ac@@ ey Mar@@ ra from P@@ it@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh , along with a number of colle@@ ag@@ ues around the world ."
"They &apos;ve decided that li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id , which — in the United States , we have a lot of li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a great s@@ our@@ ce of stem cells .
S@@ te@@ m cells are p@@ ac@@ ked in that li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id .
"So you could go in , you could get your tum@@ my@@ -@@ t@@ uc@@ k ."
"O@@ ut comes the li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id , and in this case , the stem cells are is@@ ol@@ ated and turned into neurons ."
A@@ ll done in the la@@ b .
"And I think fa@@ ir@@ ly so@@ on , you will see patients being tre@@ ated with their own f@@ at@@ -@@ der@@ iv@@ ed , or a@@ di@@ pos@@ e-@@ der@@ iv@@ ed , stem cells ."
I tal@@ ked before about the use of dev@@ ices to dra@@ ma@@ tically change the way we treat disease .
Here &apos;s just one example before I cl@@ ose up .
This is equ@@ ally tra@@ g@@ ic .
"We have a very ab@@ id@@ ing and he@@ art@@ bre@@ ak@@ ing par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship with our colle@@ ag@@ ues at the In@@ st@@ it@@ ute for S@@ ur@@ g@@ ical R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch in the U@@ S Ar@@ my , who have to treat the now 1@@ 1@@ ,000 kids that have come back from I@@ ra@@ q ."
M@@ any of those patients are very s@@ ever@@ ely b@@ urn@@ ed .
"And if there &apos;s anything that &apos;s been learned about bur@@ n , it &apos;s that we don &apos;t know how to treat it ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing that is done to treat bur@@ n — basically we do a so@@ d@@ ding approach .
"We make something over here , and then we trans@@ pl@@ ant it on@@ to the s@@ ite of the w@@ ound , and we try and get the two to take ."
"In this case here , a new , we@@ ar@@ able bi@@ o-@@ re@@ ac@@ tor has been des@@ ign@@ ed — it should be t@@ es@@ ted cl@@ in@@ ically later this year at I@@ S@@ R — by Jo@@ er@@ g G@@ er@@ l@@ ach in P@@ it@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh ."
And that bi@@ o-@@ re@@ ac@@ tor will la@@ y down in the w@@ ound b@@ ed .
The gu@@ n that you see there sp@@ ra@@ ys cells .
That &apos;s going to sp@@ ra@@ y cells over that are@@ a .
"The re@@ ac@@ tor will ser@@ ve to f@@ ert@@ il@@ ize the environ@@ ment , del@@ iv@@ er other things as well at the same time , and ther@@ e@@ fore we will se@@ ed that la@@ wn , as op@@ posed to try the so@@ d@@ ding approach ."
It &apos;s a complet@@ ely different way of doing it .
So my 1@@ 8 minutes is up .
"So let me fin@@ ish up with some good news , and maybe a little bit of bad news ."
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very po@@ wer@@ ful work .
C@@ lear@@ ly the imag@@ es kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredi@@ bly difficult because it &apos;s high@@ ly inter@@ -@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ ary .
Al@@ most every field of science engine@@ er@@ ing and cl@@ in@@ ical pra@@ c@@ tice is inv@@ ol@@ ved in trying to get this to happen .
"A number of govern@@ ments , and a number of regi@@ ons , have recogni@@ z@@ ed that this is a new way to treat disease ."
"The Jap@@ an@@ ese govern@@ ment were perhaps the first , when they decided to inv@@ est first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field ."
It &apos;s no co@@ inc@@ idence .
Japan is the ol@@ d@@ est country on ear@@ th in terms of its average age .
They need this to work or their health system di@@ es .
So they &apos;re p@@ ut@@ ting a lot of stra@@ te@@ g@@ ic inv@@ est@@ ment f@@ oc@@ used in this are@@ a .
"The Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on , same thing ."
"@@ China , the same thing ."
China just la@@ un@@ ched a national t@@ issu@@ e-@@ engine@@ er@@ ing center .
The first year b@@ ud@@ get was 2@@ 50 million U@@ S dollars .
In the United States we &apos;ve had a some@@ what different approach .
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , for A@@ l G@@ ore to come and be in the real world as pres@@ ident ."
We &apos;ve had a different approach .
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fun@@ d things as they come along .
But there &apos;s been no stra@@ te@@ g@@ ic inv@@ est@@ ment to bring all of the nec@@ ess@@ ary things to be@@ ar and f@@ oc@@ us them in a c@@ are@@ ful way .
"And I &apos;m going to fin@@ ish up with a quot@@ e , maybe a little che@@ a@@ p sh@@ ot , at the direc@@ tor of the N@@ I@@ H , who &apos;s a very char@@ ming man ."
"M@@ y@@ self and J@@ ay V@@ ac@@ an@@ ti from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard went to vis@@ it with him and a number of his direc@@ tors of his inst@@ it@@ ute just a few months ago , to try and con@@ vin@@ ce him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 2@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars that he &apos;s going to get next year and f@@ oc@@ us it , in a stra@@ te@@ g@@ ic way , to make sure we can acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate the p@@ ace at which these things get to patients ."
"And at the end of a very t@@ es@@ ty me@@ et@@ ing , what the N@@ I@@ H direc@@ tor said was , &quot; Y@@ our vision is larg@@ er than our app@@ et@@ ite . &quot;"
"I &apos;d like to cl@@ ose by saying that no one &apos;s going to change our vision , but together we can change his app@@ et@@ ite ."
Thank you .
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple requ@@ est .
"I &apos;d like all of you to p@@ ause for a moment , you w@@ re@@ t@@ ched we@@ ak@@ l@@ ings , and take st@@ ock of your mis@@ er@@ able ex@@ ist@@ ence ."
( Laughter ) Now that was the ad@@ vic@@ e that St@@ . B@@ en@@ ed@@ ic@@ t gave his rather star@@ t@@ led follo@@ w@@ ers in the fi@@ f@@ th century .
It was the ad@@ vic@@ e that I decided to fol@@ low myself when I turned 40 .
"@@ U@@ p until that moment , I had been that clas@@ si@@ c cor@@ por@@ ate war@@ ri@@ or — I was e@@ ating too much , I was dr@@ in@@ king too much , I was working too hard and I was ne@@ gl@@ ec@@ ting the family ."
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around .
"In particular , I decided I would try to ad@@ d@@ ress the th@@ or@@ ny issue of work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance ."
"So I ste@@ pped back from the work@@ force , and I sp@@ ent a year at home with my wife and four young children ."
But all I learned about work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance from that year was that I found it quite easy to bal@@ ance work and life when I didn &apos;t have any work .
"( Laughter ) Not a very us@@ e@@ ful sk@@ ill , es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally when the money run@@ s out ."
"So I went back to work , and I &apos;ve sp@@ ent these seven years since str@@ ug@@ gl@@ ing with , stud@@ ying and writ@@ ing about work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance ."
And I have four observ@@ ations I &apos;d like to share with you today .
"The first is : if society &apos;s to make any progress on this issue , we need an hon@@ est deb@@ ate ."
But the tro@@ ub@@ le is so many people talk so much r@@ ub@@ b@@ ish about work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance .
"A@@ ll the disc@@ us@@ sions about fle@@ x@@ i@@ -@@ time or d@@ res@@ s@@ -@@ down F@@ ri@@ days or pat@@ er@@ n@@ ity leave only ser@@ ve to mas@@ k the cor@@ e issue , which is that certain job and c@@ are@@ er cho@@ ices are fundam@@ ent@@ ally in@@ comp@@ ati@@ ble with being me@@ an@@ ing@@ fully en@@ gag@@ ed on a da@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ day bas@@ is with a young family ."
Now the first ste@@ p in sol@@ v@@ ing any problem is ac@@ kno@@ w@@ l@@ ed@@ ging the reality of the sit@@ u@@ ation you &apos;re in .
"And the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there lead@@ ing lives of qu@@ iet , scre@@ am@@ ing des@@ per@@ ation , where they work long , hard h@@ ours at j@@ obs they h@@ ate to en@@ able them to buy things they don &apos;t need to im@@ pres@@ s people they don &apos;t like ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s my cont@@ en@@ tion that going to work on F@@ ri@@ day in j@@ e@@ ans and &#91; a &#93; T@@ -@@ shir@@ t isn &apos;t really getting to the n@@ u@@ b of the issue . ( Laughter )
The second observ@@ ation I &apos;d like to make is we need to face the tr@@ uth that govern@@ ments and cor@@ por@@ ations ar@@ en &apos;t going to sol@@ ve this issue for us .
We should stop looking outside .
It &apos;s up to us as individ@@ u@@ als to take contro@@ l and responsi@@ bil@@ ity for the typ@@ e of lives that we want to le@@ ad .
"If you don &apos;t des@@ ign your life , someone else will des@@ ign it for you , and you may just not like their idea of bal@@ ance ."
"It &apos;s particul@@ arly important — this isn &apos;t on the World W@@ ide W@@ eb , is it ? I &apos;m about to get fi@@ red — it &apos;s particul@@ arly important that you never put the qu@@ ality of your life in the h@@ ands of a com@@ mer@@ cial cor@@ por@@ ation ."
"Now I &apos;m not talking here just about the bad comp@@ an@@ ies — the &quot; &quot; ab@@ at@@ to@@ ir@@ s of the human s@@ ou@@ l , &quot; &quot; as I call them ."
( Laughter ) I &apos;m talking about all comp@@ an@@ ies .
Because com@@ mer@@ cial comp@@ an@@ ies are in@@ her@@ ently des@@ ign@@ ed to get as much out of you &#91; as &#93; they can get away with .
"It &apos;s in their nature ; it &apos;s in their D@@ N@@ A ; it &apos;s what they do — even the good , well-@@ int@@ enti@@ on@@ ed comp@@ an@@ ies ."
"O@@ n the one hand , p@@ ut@@ ting chil@@ d@@ care fac@@ il@@ ities in the work@@ place is wonderful and en@@ li@@ gh@@ t@@ en@@ ed ."
"O@@ n the other hand , it &apos;s a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are — it just means you sp@@ end more time at the blo@@ ody of@@ fic@@ e ."
We have to be responsi@@ ble for s@@ etting and en@@ for@@ c@@ ing the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies that we want in our life .
The th@@ ir@@ d observ@@ ation is we have to be c@@ are@@ ful with the time fra@@ me that we cho@@ ose up@@ on which to j@@ ud@@ ge our bal@@ ance .
"B@@ e@@ fore I went back to work after my year at home , I sa@@ t down and I w@@ ro@@ te out a deta@@ il@@ ed , ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ ste@@ p descri@@ p@@ tion of the ide@@ al bal@@ an@@ ced day that I as@@ pi@@ red to ."
And it went like this : w@@ ake up well re@@ st@@ ed after a good ni@@ ght &apos;s s@@ le@@ ep .
H@@ ave sex .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g .
H@@ ave bre@@ ak@@ fas@@ t with my wife and children .
H@@ ave sex again .
( Laughter ) D@@ r@@ ive the kids to school on the way to the of@@ fic@@ e .
Do three h@@ ours &apos; work .
P@@ la@@ y a spor@@ t with a fri@@ end at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time .
Do another three h@@ ours &apos; work .
M@@ e@@ et some mat@@ es in the p@@ u@@ b for an early ev@@ ening dr@@ ink .
D@@ r@@ ive home for din@@ ner with my wife and kids .
M@@ ed@@ it@@ ate for half an h@@ our .
H@@ ave sex .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g . H@@ ave sex again .
G@@ o to b@@ ed .
( Applause ) How of@@ ten do you think I have that day ?
( Laughter ) We need to be real@@ is@@ tic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
"We need to el@@ on@@ ga@@ te the time fra@@ me up@@ on which we j@@ ud@@ ge the bal@@ ance in our life , but we need to el@@ on@@ ga@@ te it without f@@ all@@ ing into the tra@@ p of the &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll have a life when I re@@ ti@@ re , when my kids have left home , when my wife has div@@ or@@ ced me , my health is fail@@ ing , I &apos;ve got no mat@@ es or interes@@ ts left . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A day is too shor@@ t ; &quot; &quot; after I re@@ ti@@ re &quot; &quot; is too long ."
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
A f@@ our@@ th observ@@ ation : We need to approach bal@@ ance in a bal@@ an@@ ced way .
"A fri@@ end came to see me last year — and she doesn &apos;t mind me telling this story — a fri@@ end came to see me last year and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ ig@@ el , I &apos;ve read your bo@@ ok ."
And I real@@ ize that my life is complet@@ ely out of bal@@ ance .
It &apos;s tot@@ ally domin@@ ated by work .
I work 10 h@@ ours a day ; I com@@ m@@ ute two h@@ ours a day .
A@@ ll of my relation@@ shi@@ ps have fail@@ ed .
There &apos;s nothing in my life ap@@ art from my work .
So I &apos;ve decided to get a g@@ ri@@ p and sort it out .
"So I jo@@ ined a g@@ y@@ m . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now I don &apos;t mean to mo@@ c@@ k , but being a f@@ it 1@@ 0-@@ h@@ our@@ -@@ a-@@ day of@@ fic@@ e r@@ at isn &apos;t more bal@@ an@@ ced ; it &apos;s more f@@ it . ( Laughter )"
"@@ L@@ ov@@ ely though physical ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise may be , there are other parts to life — there &apos;s the int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ al side ; there &apos;s the emo@@ tional side ; there &apos;s the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual side ."
"And to be bal@@ an@@ ced , I believe we have to att@@ end to all of those are@@ as — not just do 50 st@@ o@@ ma@@ ch c@@ run@@ ch@@ es ."
Now that can be da@@ un@@ ting .
"Because people say , &quot; &quot; B@@ lo@@ ody h@@ ell mate , I hav@@ en &apos;t got time to get f@@ it ."
You want me to go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and call my mother . &quot; &quot; And I understand .
I truly understand how that can be da@@ un@@ ting .
But an inc@@ ident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new per@@ spec@@ tive .
"M@@ y wife , who is some@@ where in the audi@@ ence today , called me up at the of@@ fic@@ e and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ ig@@ el , you need to pic@@ k our youn@@ gest son &quot; &quot; — H@@ ar@@ ry — &quot; &quot; up from school . &quot; &quot; Because she had to be some@@ where else with the other three children for that ev@@ ening ."
So I left work an h@@ our early that af@@ ter@@ no@@ on and pic@@ ked H@@ ar@@ ry up at the school ga@@ t@@ es .
"We wal@@ ked down to the loc@@ al par@@ k , m@@ ess@@ ed around on the s@@ w@@ ings , play@@ ed some sil@@ ly gam@@ es ."
"I then wal@@ ked him up the h@@ ill to the loc@@ al c@@ af@@ e , and we shar@@ ed a p@@ iz@@ z@@ a for two , then wal@@ ked down the h@@ ill to our home , and I gave him his b@@ ath and put him in his B@@ at@@ man pa@@ j@@ amas ."
"I then read him a ch@@ ap@@ ter of R@@ o@@ al@@ d D@@ a@@ h@@ l &apos;s &quot; &quot; J@@ am@@ es and the G@@ i@@ ant P@@ each . &quot; &quot; I then put him to b@@ ed , t@@ uc@@ ked him in , gave him a k@@ is@@ s on his for@@ e@@ head and said , &quot; &quot; Go@@ od@@ ni@@ ght , mate , &quot; &quot; and wal@@ ked out of his bed@@ room ."
"As I was walking out of his bed@@ room , he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad ? &quot; &quot; I went , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , mate ? &quot; &quot; He went , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad , this has been the best day of my life , ever . &quot; &quot; I h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t done anything , h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t taken him to D@@ is@@ ney World or b@@ ou@@ ght him a P@@ la@@ y@@ st@@ ation ."
Now my point is the small things matter .
B@@ e@@ ing more bal@@ an@@ ced doesn &apos;t mean dra@@ ma@@ tic up@@ he@@ av@@ al in your life .
"W@@ it@@ h the sm@@ all@@ est inv@@ est@@ ment in the right plac@@ es , you can rad@@ ically trans@@ form the qu@@ ality of your relation@@ shi@@ ps and the qu@@ ality of your life ."
"M@@ or@@ e@@ over , I think , it can trans@@ form society ."
"Because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s defin@@ ition of success away from the mo@@ ron@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ is@@ tic not@@ ion that the person with the most money when he di@@ es w@@ ins , to a more thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful and bal@@ an@@ ced defin@@ ition of what a life well liv@@ ed looks like ."
"And that , I think , is an idea wor@@ th sp@@ read@@ ing ."
( Applause )
I mov@@ ed to America 12 years ago with my wife Ter@@ ry and our two kids .
We &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed every country we &apos;ve en@@ coun@@ tered .
( Applause ) Because it &apos;s le@@ av@@ ing mil@@ lions of children be@@ h@@ ind .
It actually c@@ os@@ ts an en@@ or@@ mo@@ us amount to mo@@ p up the da@@ mag@@ e from the dro@@ p@@ out c@@ ris@@ is .
But the dro@@ p@@ out c@@ ris@@ is is just the ti@@ p of an ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g .
America sp@@ ends more money on education than most other countries .
C@@ las@@ s si@@ z@@ es are sm@@ all@@ er than in many countries .
"The tro@@ ub@@ le is , it &apos;s all going in the wrong direc@@ tion ."
"There are three princi@@ pl@@ es on which human life fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ es , and they are cont@@ rad@@ ic@@ ted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to lab@@ or and most students have to end@@ ure ."
How about two children or more ? R@@ ight .
And the rest of you have seen such children .
Ar@@ en &apos;t they ?
What schools are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to do is to find out what kids can do across a very nar@@ row spec@@ tr@@ um of achi@@ ev@@ ement .
I &apos;m not here to arg@@ ue against science and mat@@ h .
"A real education has to give equal we@@ ight to the ar@@ ts , the hum@@ an@@ ities , to physical education ."
A@@ D@@ H@@ D .
"It &apos;s a real achi@@ ev@@ ement to put that particular abil@@ ity out , or to s@@ ti@@ f@@ le it ."
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers are the lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od of the success of schools .
"A@@ n old fri@@ end of min@@ e — actually very old , he &apos;s de@@ ad ."
There he is . He &apos;s di@@ et@@ ing .
The ro@@ le of a teacher is to fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate learning .
They should be diag@@ nos@@ tic . They should help .
"So in place of cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , what we have is a culture of comp@@ li@@ ance ."
O@@ ur children and teachers are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to fol@@ low ro@@ ut@@ ine alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms rather than to exc@@ ite that power of imag@@ in@@ ation and cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
"I mean , you may have a do@@ g ."
"You know , but it doesn &apos;t l@@ ist@@ en to R@@ a@@ di@@ o@@ head , does it ?"
"In@@ ste@@ ad , what we have is a culture of stan@@ dar@@ di@@ z@@ ation ."
That &apos;s one of the problems of the test .
No . I think there &apos;s a population of around five million in F@@ in@@ l@@ and .
M@@ any states in America have fe@@ wer people in them than that .
It &apos;s like people are sa@@ il@@ ing into a he@@ ad@@ w@@ ind all the time .
It &apos;s a human system .
E@@ very stud@@ ent who dro@@ ps out of school has a reason for it which is ro@@ ot@@ ed in their own bi@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ y .
They may find it bor@@ ing .
They &apos;re very person@@ aliz@@ ed .
And they work .
"C@@ ul@@ ture is an organ@@ ic ter@@ m , isn &apos;t it ?"
"In the w@@ in@@ ter of 200@@ 4 , it ra@@ ined in D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ ley ."
S@@ even in@@ ch@@ es of ra@@ in f@@ ell over a very shor@@ t peri@@ od .
The whole flo@@ or of D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ ley was car@@ p@@ et@@ ed in flo@@ w@@ ers for a while .
G@@ re@@ at lead@@ ers know that .
"And if the movement is strong enough , that &apos;s , in the best sense of the word , a re@@ vol@@ ution ."
Thank you very much .
Why do so many people re@@ ach success and then fa@@ il ?
"One of the big reas@@ ons is , we think success is a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et ."
"So we do everything that lead@@ s up to success , but then we get there . We fig@@ ure we &apos;ve made it , we s@@ it back in our com@@ for@@ t z@@ one , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful ."
And it doesn &apos;t take long to go do@@ w@@ n@@ h@@ ill .
"And I can tell you this happens , because it happened to me ."
"@@ R@@ e@@ ach@@ ing success , I worked hard , I p@@ u@@ shed myself ."
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped , because I fig@@ ured , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , you know , I made it ."
"I can just s@@ it back and rel@@ a@@ x . &quot; &quot; R@@ e@@ ach@@ ing success , I always tried to impro@@ ve and do good work ."
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped because I fig@@ ured , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m good enough ."
"I don &apos;t need to impro@@ ve any more . &quot; &quot; R@@ e@@ ach@@ ing success , I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas ."
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas .
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped , because I fig@@ ured I was this h@@ ot@@ -@@ sh@@ ot guy and I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have to work at ideas , they should just come like mag@@ ic ."
And the only thing that came was cre@@ ative b@@ loc@@ k .
I c@@ ouldn &apos;t come up with any ideas .
"@@ R@@ e@@ ach@@ ing success , I always f@@ oc@@ used on cli@@ ents and pro@@ jects , and ign@@ or@@ ed the money . Th@@ en all this money started p@@ our@@ ing in ."
And I got dis@@ trac@@ ted by it .
"And su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I was on the ph@@ one to my st@@ oc@@ k@@ bro@@ k@@ er and my real est@@ ate ag@@ ent , when I should have been talking to my cli@@ ents ."
"And re@@ ach@@ ing success , I always did what I lov@@ ed ."
"But then I got into stuff that I didn &apos;t love , like man@@ ag@@ ement . I am the world &apos;s wor@@ st man@@ ag@@ er , but I fig@@ ured I should be doing it , because I was , after all , the pres@@ ident of the comp@@ any ."
"Well , so@@ on a black cl@@ ou@@ d form@@ ed over my head and here I was , ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ d@@ ly very successful , but in@@ war@@ d@@ ly very depres@@ sed ."
But I &apos;m a guy ; I knew how to fi@@ x it .
I b@@ ou@@ ght a fas@@ t c@@ ar .
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t help .
I was fas@@ ter but just as depres@@ sed .
"So I went to my doc@@ tor . I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ c , I can buy anything I want . But I &apos;m not happy . I &apos;m depres@@ sed ."
"It &apos;s true what they say , and I didn &apos;t believe it until it happened to me ."
"But money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . But it can buy P@@ ro@@ z@@ ac . &quot; &quot; And he put me on an@@ ti@@ -@@ depres@@ san@@ ts ."
"And ye@@ ah , the black cl@@ ou@@ d f@@ ad@@ ed a little bit , but so did all the work , because I was just flo@@ ating along . I c@@ ouldn &apos;t care less if cli@@ ents ever called ."
( Laughter ) And cli@@ ents didn &apos;t call . ( Laughter )
"Because they could see I was no longer serv@@ ing them , I was only serv@@ ing myself ."
So they took their money and their pro@@ jects to others who would ser@@ ve them better .
"Well , it didn &apos;t take long for b@@ usiness to drop like a ro@@ c@@ k ."
"M@@ y par@@ t@@ ner and I , Th@@ om , we had to let all our em@@ pl@@ o@@ ye@@ es go ."
"It was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under ."
And that was great .
"Because with no em@@ pl@@ o@@ ye@@ es , there was nob@@ ody for me to man@@ age ."
So I went back to doing the pro@@ jects I lov@@ ed .
"I had fu@@ n again , I worked har@@ der and , to c@@ ut a long story shor@@ t , did all the things that took me back up to success ."
But it wasn &apos;t a quic@@ k tri@@ p .
It took seven years .
"But in the end , b@@ usiness gre@@ w big@@ ger than ever ."
"And when I went back to follo@@ wing these eight princi@@ pl@@ es , the black cl@@ ou@@ d over my head di@@ sa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed al@@ together ."
"And I wo@@ ke up one day and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t need P@@ ro@@ z@@ ac any@@ more . &quot;"
And I thre@@ w it away and hav@@ en &apos;t needed it since .
I learned that success isn &apos;t a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t look like this ; it really looks more like this .
It &apos;s a contin@@ u@@ ous jour@@ ney .
"And if we want to av@@ o@@ id &quot; &quot; success@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ fail@@ u@@ re@@ -@@ sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me , &quot; &quot; we just keep follo@@ wing these eight princi@@ pl@@ es , because that is not only how we achi@@ eve success , it &apos;s how we su@@ st@@ ain it ."
So here is to your contin@@ u@@ ed success .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"C@@ an we , as ad@@ ults , grow new ner@@ ve cells ?"
So this is this gra@@ y struc@@ ture in the center of the brain .
So why are these new neurons important and what are their fun@@ c@@ tions ?
"F@@ irst , we know that they &apos;re important for learning and me@@ mor@@ y ."
The answer is y@@ es .
And we are now going to do a little qu@@ i@@ z .
A@@ re we ready ?
"O@@ K , let &apos;s go ."
So what about learning ?
In@@ cre@@ as@@ ing ?
How about st@@ ress ?
"@@ Y@@ es , st@@ ress will de@@ cre@@ ase the produc@@ tion of new neurons in the h@@ ip@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us ."
"In@@ de@@ ed , it will de@@ cre@@ ase neu@@ rog@@ en@@ esis ."
"O@@ h , w@@ ow !@@ "
How about getting ol@@ der ?
"And then finally , how about run@@ ning ?"
I will let you j@@ ud@@ ge that one by yourself .
"So acti@@ vity im@@ p@@ ac@@ ts neu@@ rog@@ en@@ esis , but that &apos;s not all ."
E@@ th@@ an@@ ol — in@@ take of al@@ co@@ h@@ ol — will de@@ cre@@ ase neu@@ rog@@ en@@ esis .
M@@ H : I &apos;m really interes@@ ted in the run@@ ning thing .
Do I have to ru@@ n ?
What is going to be the future of learning ?
"I do have a pl@@ an , but in order for me to tell you what that pl@@ an is , I need to tell you a little story , which kind of s@@ ets the st@@ age ."
"I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?"
"And you can look far back into the past , but if you look at pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing the way it is , it &apos;s quite easy to fig@@ ure out where it came from ."
"It came from about 3@@ 00 years ago , and it came from the last and the big@@ gest of the em@@ pir@@ es on this planet . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Brit@@ ish E@@ m@@ pir@@ e &quot; &quot; &#93; I@@ mag@@ ine trying to ru@@ n the show , trying to ru@@ n the enti@@ re planet , without comput@@ ers , without t@@ el@@ e@@ ph@@ ones , with data h@@ and@@ writ@@ ten on piec@@ es of p@@ ap@@ er , and tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing by shi@@ ps ."
But the V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ ans actually did it .
What they did was ama@@ zing .
They created a global computer made up of people .
It &apos;s still with us today .
It &apos;s called the bu@@ re@@ auc@@ ra@@ tic ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tive machine .
"In order to have that machine run@@ ning , you need lots and lots of people ."
They made another machine to produce those people : the school .
The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bu@@ re@@ auc@@ ra@@ tic ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tive machine .
They must be id@@ en@@ tical to each other .
"They must know three things : They must have good h@@ and@@ writ@@ ing , because the data is h@@ and@@ writ@@ ten ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do multi@@ plic@@ ation , div@@ is@@ ion , ad@@ d@@ ition and sub@@ trac@@ tion in their head ."
They must be so id@@ en@@ tical that you could pic@@ k one up from New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and and ship them to C@@ an@@ ada and he would be inst@@ an@@ tly fun@@ c@@ tional .
The V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ ans were great engine@@ ers .
"They engine@@ er@@ ed a system that was so rob@@ ust that it &apos;s still with us today , contin@@ u@@ ously produc@@ ing id@@ en@@ tical people for a machine that no longer ex@@ ists ."
"The em@@ pir@@ e is g@@ one , so what are we doing with that des@@ ign that produc@@ es these id@@ en@@ tical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?"
&#91; &quot; &quot; S@@ cho@@ ols as we know them are ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e &quot; &quot; &#93; So that &apos;s a pretty strong com@@ ment there .
"I said schools as we know them now , they &apos;re ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ."
I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re bro@@ ken .
It &apos;s quite fa@@ shi@@ on@@ able to say that the education system &apos;s bro@@ ken .
It &apos;s not bro@@ ken . It &apos;s wonder@@ fully con@@ struc@@ ted .
It &apos;s just that we don &apos;t need it any@@ more . It &apos;s ou@@ t@@ da@@ ted .
What are the kind of j@@ obs that we have today ?
"Well , the cl@@ er@@ ks are the comput@@ ers ."
They &apos;re there in thousands in every of@@ fic@@ e .
And you have people who gu@@ ide those comput@@ ers to do their cl@@ er@@ ical j@@ obs .
Th@@ ose people don &apos;t need to be able to w@@ r@@ ite beauti@@ fully by hand .
They don &apos;t need to be able to multi@@ ply numbers in their he@@ ad@@ s .
They do need to be able to read .
"In fact , they need to be able to read disc@@ er@@ n@@ ing@@ ly ."
"Well , that &apos;s today , but we don &apos;t even know what the j@@ obs of the future are going to look like ."
"We know that people will work from wh@@ er@@ ever they want , wh@@ en@@ ever they want , in wh@@ at@@ ever way they want ."
How is pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing going to pre@@ p@@ are them for that world ?
"Well , I b@@ um@@ ped into this whole thing complet@@ ely by acc@@ ident ."
"I used to te@@ ach people how to w@@ r@@ ite computer program@@ s in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i , 14 years ago ."
"And right next to where I used to work , there was a sl@@ um ."
"And I used to think , how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to w@@ r@@ ite computer program@@ s ?"
O@@ r should they not ?
"A@@ t the same time , we also had lots of par@@ ents , rich people , who had comput@@ ers , and who used to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , my son , I think he &apos;s gi@@ f@@ ted , because he does wonderful things with comput@@ ers ."
"And my daughter — o@@ h , sur@@ ely she is ex@@ tra@@ -@@ intellig@@ ent . &quot; &quot; And so on . So I su@@ d@@ den@@ ly fig@@ ured that , how come all the rich people are having these ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily gi@@ f@@ ted children ?"
( Laughter ) What did the poor do wrong ?
"I made a h@@ ole in the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y w@@ all of the sl@@ um next to my of@@ fic@@ e , and st@@ uc@@ k a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any English , didn &apos;t know what the Inter@@ net was ."
The children came run@@ ning in .
"It was three fe@@ et off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , it &apos;s , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Just like that . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Can we tou@@ ch it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I@@ f you w@@ ish to . &quot; &quot; And I went away ."
"A@@ b@@ out eight h@@ ours later , we found them bro@@ w@@ sing and teach@@ ing each other how to bro@@ w@@ se ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; Well that &apos;s im@@ possible , because — How is it possible ? They don &apos;t know anything . &quot; &quot; M@@ y colle@@ ag@@ ues said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s a simple sol@@ ution ."
"One of your students must have been pas@@ sing by , showed them how to use the mo@@ use . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , that &apos;s possible . &quot; &quot; So I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment . I went 3@@ 00 mil@@ es out of D@@ el@@ h@@ i into a really re@@ mo@@ te village where the chan@@ ces of a pas@@ sing sof@@ tw@@ are develop@@ ment engine@@ er was very little . ( Laughter ) I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment there ."
"There was no place to st@@ ay , so I st@@ uc@@ k my computer in , I went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids pl@@ a@@ ying gam@@ es on it ."
"When they saw me , they said , &quot; We want a fas@@ ter proc@@ ess@@ or and a better mo@@ use . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; How on Earth do you know all this ? &quot; &quot; And they said something very interesting to me ."
"In an ir@@ rit@@ ated vo@@ ice , they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve giv@@ en us a machine that works only in English , so we had to te@@ ach ourselves English in order to use it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time , as a teacher , that I had heard the word &quot; &quot; te@@ ach ourselves &quot; &quot; said so c@@ as@@ ually ."
Here &apos;s a shor@@ t g@@ lim@@ p@@ se from those years .
That &apos;s the first day at the H@@ ole in the W@@ all .
O@@ n your right is an e@@ igh@@ t@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old .
T@@ o his left is his stud@@ ent . She &apos;s six .
And he &apos;s teach@@ ing her how to bro@@ w@@ se .
"Th@@ en on@@ to other parts of the country , I re@@ pe@@ ated this over and over again , getting exactly the same results that we were ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; H@@ ole in the w@@ all fil@@ m - 19@@ 9@@ 9 &quot; &quot; &#93; A@@ n e@@ igh@@ t@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old telling his el@@ der sis@@ ter what to do .
"And finally a girl expl@@ ain@@ ing in M@@ ara@@ th@@ i what it is , and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a proc@@ ess@@ or inside . &quot; &quot; So I started publi@@ sh@@ ing ."
"I published every@@ where . I w@@ ro@@ te down and meas@@ ured everything , and I said , in n@@ ine months , a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will re@@ ach the same stan@@ dar@@ d as an of@@ fic@@ e sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary in the W@@ est ."
I &apos;d seen it happen over and over and over again .
"But I was cur@@ i@@ ous to know , what else would they do if they could do this much ?"
"I started experim@@ ent@@ ing with other sub@@ jects , amo@@ n@@ g them , for example , pro@@ n@@ un@@ ci@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s one commun@@ ity of children in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India wh@@ ose English pro@@ n@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is really bad , and they needed good pro@@ n@@ un@@ ci@@ ation because that would impro@@ ve their j@@ obs ."
"I gave them a spe@@ e@@ ch@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ t@@ ex@@ t en@@ g@@ ine in a computer , and I said , &quot; &quot; K@@ e@@ ep talking into it until it typ@@ es what you say . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They did that , and watch a little bit of this ."
C@@ om@@ p@@ ut@@ er : N@@ ice to me@@ et y@@ ou@@ .@@ Ch@@ il@@ d : N@@ ice to me@@ et you .
Su@@ ga@@ ta M@@ it@@ ra : The reason I end@@ ed with the face of this young l@@ ad@@ y over there is because I sus@@ p@@ ect many of you know her .
She has now jo@@ ined a call center in H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad and may have t@@ or@@ tu@@ red you about your cre@@ dit c@@ ard bil@@ ls in a very c@@ lear English ac@@ cent .
"So then people said , well , how far will it go ?"
Wh@@ ere does it stop ?
I decided I would des@@ tro@@ y my own arg@@ ument by cre@@ ating an ab@@ sur@@ d pro@@ position .
"I made a hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis , a r@@ id@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis ."
"T@@ ami@@ l is a s@@ ou@@ th In@@ dian language , and I said , can T@@ am@@ il@@ -@@ speak@@ ing children in a s@@ ou@@ th In@@ dian village learn the bi@@ ot@@ e@@ chn@@ ology of D@@ N@@ A re@@ plic@@ ation in English from a stre@@ ets@@ ide computer ?"
"And I said , I &apos;ll measure them . They &apos;ll get a z@@ ero ."
"I &apos;ll sp@@ end a couple of months , I &apos;ll leave it for a couple of months , I &apos;ll go back , they &apos;ll get another z@@ ero ."
"I &apos;ll go back to the la@@ b and say , we need teachers ."
I found a village . It was called K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ p@@ am in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India .
"I put in H@@ ole in the W@@ all comput@@ ers there , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed all kinds of stuff from the Inter@@ net about D@@ N@@ A re@@ plic@@ ation , most of which I didn &apos;t understand ."
"The children came r@@ ush@@ ing , said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s all this ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very to@@ p@@ ical , very important . But it &apos;s all in English . &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; How can we understand such big English words and diag@@ ram@@ s and chem@@ is@@ try ? &quot; &quot; So by now , I had developed a new pe@@ da@@ gog@@ ical me@@ th@@ od , so I app@@ li@@ ed that . I said , &quot; &quot; I hav@@ en &apos;t the f@@ og@@ gi@@ est idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And any@@ way , I am going away . &quot; ( Laughter )"
So I left them for a couple of months .
They &apos;d got a z@@ ero . I gave them a test .
"I came back after two months and the children tro@@ op@@ ed in and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve underst@@ ood nothing . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what did I exp@@ ect ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , but how long did it take you before you decided that you can &apos;t understand anything ? &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; We hav@@ en &apos;t giv@@ en up ."
"We look at it every single day . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; What ? You don &apos;t understand these scre@@ ens and you keep star@@ ing at it for two months ? What for ? &quot; &quot; So a little girl who you see just now , she ra@@ ised her hand , and she says to me in bro@@ ken T@@ ami@@ l and English , she said , &quot; &quot; Well , ap@@ art from the fact that impro@@ per re@@ plic@@ ation of the D@@ N@@ A molecul@@ e c@@ a@@ us@@ es disease , we hav@@ en &apos;t underst@@ ood anything else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So I t@@ es@@ ted them ."
"I got an educ@@ ati@@ onal im@@ possibil@@ ity , z@@ ero to 30 percent in two months in the t@@ rop@@ ical he@@ at with a computer under the tree in a language they didn &apos;t know doing something that &apos;s a dec@@ ad@@ e a@@ head of their time ."
A@@ b@@ sur@@ d . But I had to fol@@ low the V@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ ian nor@@ m .
Th@@ ir@@ ty percent is a fa@@ il .
How do I get them to pas@@ s ? I have to get them 20 more mar@@ ks .
"I c@@ ouldn &apos;t find a teacher . What I did find was a fri@@ end that they had , a 2@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old girl who was an ac@@ coun@@ tant and she play@@ ed with them all the time ."
"So I asked this girl , &quot; &quot; Can you help them ? &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely not ."
"I didn &apos;t have science in school . I have no idea what they &apos;re doing under that tree all day long . I can &apos;t help you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what . U@@ se the me@@ th@@ od of the grand@@ mother . &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; St@@ and be@@ h@@ ind them ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever they do anything , you just say , &apos; Well , w@@ ow , I mean , how did you do that ?"
"What &apos;s the next p@@ age ? G@@ os@@ h , when I was your age , I could have never done that . &apos; You know what gr@@ an@@ ni@@ es do . &quot; &quot; So she did that for two more months ."
The sc@@ or@@ es j@@ um@@ ped to 50 percent .
"@@ K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ p@@ am had c@@ au@@ ght up with my contro@@ l school in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i , a rich pr@@ iv@@ ate school with a tra@@ ined bi@@ ot@@ e@@ chn@@ ology teacher ."
Wh@@ en I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the pl@@ a@@ ying field .
Here &apos;s K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ p@@ am .
( Ch@@ il@@ dren speak@@ ing ) Ne@@ u@@ rons ... commun@@ ic@@ ation .
"I got the c@@ amer@@ a ang@@ le wrong . That one is just ama@@ te@@ ur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her h@@ ands were like that , and she was saying neurons commun@@ ic@@ ate ."
A@@ t 12 .
So what are j@@ obs going to be like ?
"Well , we know what they &apos;re like today ."
"What &apos;s learning going to be like ? We know what it &apos;s like today , children p@@ our@@ ing over with their mobil@@ e ph@@ ones on the one hand and then rel@@ uc@@ tan@@ tly going to school to pic@@ k up their bo@@ o@@ ks with their other hand ."
What will it be to@@ mor@@ row ?
C@@ ould it be that we don &apos;t need to go to school at all ?
"C@@ ould it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?"
"C@@ ould it be — a dev@@ ast@@ ating question , a question that was f@@ ram@@ ed for me by N@@ ich@@ ol@@ as Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te — could it be that we are he@@ ad@@ ing to@@ wards or maybe in a future where kno@@ wing is ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ?"
But that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ ble . We are h@@ omo sa@@ pi@@ ens .
"@@ K@@ no@@ wing , that &apos;s what dis@@ t@@ ing@@ u@@ ish@@ es us from the ap@@ es ."
But look at it this way .
It took nature 100 million years to make the ap@@ e st@@ and up and become H@@ omo sa@@ pi@@ ens .
"It took us only 1@@ 0,000 to make kno@@ wing ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ."
What an achi@@ ev@@ ement that is .
But we have to in@@ te@@ gra@@ te that into our own future .
En@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement seems to be the k@@ ey .
"If you look at K@@ up@@ p@@ am , if you look at all of the experim@@ ents that I did , it was simply saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , &quot; &quot; sal@@ ut@@ ing learning ."
There is evidence from neuro@@ science .
"The re@@ p@@ t@@ il@@ ian part of our brain , which s@@ its in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , it sh@@ ut@@ s down everything else , it sh@@ ut@@ s down the pre@@ fron@@ t@@ al cor@@ te@@ x , the parts which learn , it sh@@ ut@@ s all of that down ."
P@@ un@@ ish@@ ment and exam@@ in@@ ations are seen as thre@@ at@@ s .
"We take our children , we make them sh@@ ut their bra@@ ins down , and then we say , &quot; &quot; P@@ er@@ form . &quot; &quot; Why did they create a system like that ?"
Because it was needed .
There was an age in the A@@ ge of E@@ m@@ pir@@ es when you needed those people who can surv@@ ive under thre@@ at .
"When you &apos;re st@@ anding in a tr@@ en@@ ch all alone , if you could have surviv@@ ed , you &apos;re ok@@ ay , you &apos;ve pas@@ sed ."
"If you didn &apos;t , you fail@@ ed ."
But the A@@ ge of E@@ m@@ pir@@ es is g@@ one .
What happens to cre@@ ati@@ vity in our age ?
We need to shi@@ ft that bal@@ ance back from thre@@ at to pleas@@ ure .
I came back to Engl@@ and looking for Brit@@ ish grand@@ mothers .
"I put out not@@ ices in p@@ ap@@ ers saying , if you are a Brit@@ ish grand@@ mother , if you have bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and and a w@@ eb c@@ amer@@ a , can you give me one h@@ our of your time per wee@@ k for f@@ ree ?"
I got 200 in the first two weeks .
I know more Brit@@ ish grand@@ mothers than any@@ one in the universe . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re called the G@@ ran@@ ny C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
The G@@ ran@@ ny C@@ l@@ ou@@ d s@@ its on the Inter@@ net .
"If there &apos;s a child in tro@@ ub@@ le , we be@@ am a G@@ ra@@ n ."
She goes on over S@@ k@@ yp@@ e and she sor@@ ts things out .
"I &apos;ve seen them do it from a village called D@@ ig@@ gl@@ es in nor@@ th@@ w@@ es@@ tern Engl@@ and , de@@ ep inside a village in T@@ ami@@ l N@@ ad@@ u , India , 6@@ ,000 mil@@ es away ."
She does it with only one ag@@ e-@@ old g@@ es@@ ture .
&quot; S@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot;
O@@ kay ?
W@@ at@@ ch this .
G@@ r@@ and@@ mother : You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me . You say it . You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me .
Ch@@ il@@ dren : You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me . G@@ r@@ and@@ mother : I &apos;m the G@@ ing@@ er@@ b@@ read M@@ an@@ .@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren : I &apos;m the G@@ ing@@ er@@ b@@ read M@@ an . G@@ r@@ and@@ mother : Well done ! V@@ ery good . S@@ M : So what &apos;s happening here ? I think what we need to look at is
we need to look at learning as the produc@@ t of educ@@ ati@@ onal self-@@ organiz@@ ation .
"If you allow the educ@@ ati@@ onal process to self-@@ organ@@ ize , then learning emer@@ g@@ es ."
It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
It &apos;s about l@@ etting it happen .
The teacher s@@ ets the process in mo@@ tion and then she st@@ ands back in a@@ we and wat@@ ch@@ es as learning happens .
I think that &apos;s what all this is poin@@ ting at .
But how will we know ? How will we come to know ?
"Well , I int@@ end to build these S@@ el@@ f-@@ O@@ r@@ gan@@ iz@@ ed L@@ ear@@ ning En@@ viron@@ ments ."
"They are basically bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and , col@@ labor@@ ation and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement put together ."
"I &apos;ve tried this in many , many schools ."
"It &apos;s been tried all over the world , and teachers sort of st@@ and back and say , &quot; &quot; It just happens by itself ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , it happens by itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How did you know that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t believe the children who told me and where they &apos;re from . &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a S@@ O@@ L@@ E in action ."
( Ch@@ il@@ dren talking ) This one is in Engl@@ and .
"He ma@@ int@@ ains la@@ w and order , because remem@@ ber , there &apos;s no teacher around ."
G@@ ir@@ l : The tot@@ al number of elec@@ t@@ rons is not equal to the tot@@ al number of pro@@ t@@ ons — S@@ M : A@@ ust@@ ral@@ ia G@@ ir@@ l : — giving it a net positive or nega@@ tive elec@@ tr@@ ical ch@@ arg@@ e .
The net ch@@ arg@@ e on an ion is equal to the number of pro@@ t@@ ons in the ion min@@ us the number of elec@@ t@@ rons .
S@@ M : A dec@@ ad@@ e a@@ head of her time .
"So S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s , I think we need a cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um of big questions ."
You already heard about that . You know what that means .
"There was a time when St@@ one A@@ ge men and women used to s@@ it and look up at the sk@@ y and say , &quot; What are those tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing li@@ ghts ? &quot;"
"They built the first cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um , but we &apos;ve lost sight of those won@@ dro@@ us questions ."
We &apos;ve b@@ rou@@ ght it down to the tan@@ g@@ ent of an ang@@ le .
But that &apos;s not s@@ ex@@ y enough .
"The way you would put it to a n@@ in@@ e-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old is to say , &quot; &quot; I@@ f a me@@ te@@ or@@ ite was coming to h@@ it the Earth , how would you fig@@ ure out if it was going to or not ? &quot; &quot; And if he says , &quot; &quot; Well , what ? how ? &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a mag@@ ic word . It &apos;s called the tan@@ g@@ ent of an ang@@ le , &quot; &quot; and leave him alone . He &apos;ll fig@@ ure it out ."
So here are a couple of imag@@ es from S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s .
"I &apos;ve tried incredible , incredible questions — &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en did the world be@@ g@@ in ? How will it end ? &quot; &quot; — to n@@ in@@ e-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds ."
This one is about what happens to the air we bre@@ a@@ the .
This is done by children without the help of any teacher .
"The teacher only ra@@ is@@ es the question , and then st@@ ands back and ad@@ mir@@ es the answer ."
So what &apos;s my w@@ ish ?
M@@ y w@@ ish is that we des@@ ign the future of learning .
"We don &apos;t want to be sp@@ are parts for a great human computer , do we ?"
So we need to des@@ ign a future for learning .
"And I &apos;ve got to — h@@ ang on , I &apos;ve got to get this wor@@ ding exactly right , because , you know , it &apos;s very important ."
M@@ y w@@ ish is to help des@@ ign a future of learning by sup@@ por@@ ting children all over the world to ta@@ p into their won@@ der and their abil@@ ity to work together .
H@@ el@@ p me build this school .
It will be called the S@@ cho@@ ol in the C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
It will be a school where children go on these int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ al adv@@ ent@@ ures driv@@ en by the big questions which their medi@@ at@@ ors put in .
The way I want to do this is to build a fac@@ il@@ ity where I can study this .
It &apos;s a fac@@ il@@ ity which is pra@@ c@@ tically un@@ man@@ ned .
There &apos;s only one gr@@ an@@ ny who man@@ ages health and saf@@ ety .
The rest of it &apos;s from the cl@@ ou@@ d .
"The li@@ ghts are turned on and off by the cl@@ ou@@ d , et@@ c . , et@@ c . , everything &apos;s done from the cl@@ ou@@ d ."
But I want you for another pur@@ pose .
"You can do S@@ el@@ f-@@ O@@ r@@ gan@@ iz@@ ed L@@ ear@@ ning En@@ viron@@ ments at home , in the school , outside of school , in cl@@ ub@@ s ."
It &apos;s very easy to do . There &apos;s a great doc@@ ument produc@@ ed by TE@@ D which t@@ ells you how to do it .

The universe is really big .
"We live in a galax@@ y , the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y ."
There are about a hundred billion stars in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y .
"And if you take a c@@ amer@@ a and you point it at a ran@@ dom part of the sk@@ y , and you just keep the sh@@ ut@@ ter op@@ en , as long as your c@@ amer@@ a is att@@ ach@@ ed to the H@@ ub@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace Tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e , it will see something like this ."
E@@ very one of these little bl@@ obs is a galax@@ y rou@@ gh@@ ly the si@@ ze of our M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay — a hundred billion stars in each of those bl@@ obs .
There are appro@@ x@@ i@@ mat@@ ely a hundred billion galaxies in the observ@@ able universe .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
"The age of the universe , between now and the Big Bang , is a hundred billion in do@@ g years ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich t@@ ells you something about our place in the universe .
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply ad@@ mi@@ re it .
It &apos;s extre@@ m@@ ely beautiful .
"I &apos;ve of@@ ten wonder@@ ed , what is the evolu@@ tion@@ ary pres@@ sure that made our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors in the V@@ el@@ d@@ t adap@@ t and evol@@ ve to really en@@ jo@@ y pic@@ tures of galaxies when they didn &apos;t have any ."
But we would also like to understand it .
"As a c@@ osmo@@ log@@ ist , I want to ask , why is the universe like this ?"
One big cl@@ ue we have is that the universe is chang@@ ing with time .
"If you looked at one of these galaxies and meas@@ ured its vel@@ oc@@ ity , it would be mov@@ ing away from you ."
"And if you look at a galax@@ y even far@@ ther away , it would be mov@@ ing away fas@@ ter ."
So we say the universe is exp@@ anding .
"What that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were cl@@ os@@ er together ."
"In the past , the universe was more den@@ se , and it was also h@@ ot@@ ter ."
"If you squ@@ e@@ eze things together , the tem@@ per@@ ature goes up ."
That kind of makes sense to us .
"The thing that doesn &apos;t make sense to us as much is that the universe , at early times , ne@@ ar the Big Bang , was also very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ."
You might think that that &apos;s not a sur@@ pr@@ ise .
The air in this room is very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h .
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe things just s@@ mo@@ o@@ th@@ ed themselves out . &quot; &quot; But the con@@ diti@@ ons ne@@ ar the Big Bang are very , very different than the con@@ diti@@ ons of the air in this room ."
"In particular , things were a lot den@@ s@@ er ."
The grav@@ it@@ ati@@ onal pul@@ l of things was a lot st@@ ron@@ ger ne@@ ar the Big Bang .
"What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , a hundred billion stars each ."
"A@@ t early times , those hundred billion galaxies were squ@@ e@@ ez@@ ed into a regi@@ on about this big — liter@@ ally — at early times ."
"And you have to imagine doing that squ@@ e@@ ez@@ ing without any im@@ per@@ fec@@ tions , without any little sp@@ ots where there were a few more atoms than some@@ where else ."
"Because if there had been , they would have col@@ l@@ ap@@ sed under the grav@@ it@@ ati@@ onal pul@@ l into a hu@@ ge black h@@ ole ."
"@@ K@@ e@@ e@@ ping the universe very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h at early times is not easy ; it &apos;s a del@@ ic@@ ate ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ement ."
It &apos;s a cl@@ ue that the early universe is not ch@@ os@@ en r@@ and@@ om@@ ly .
There is something that made it that way .
We would like to know what .
"So part of our understanding of this was giv@@ en to us by L@@ ud@@ wi@@ g B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n , an A@@ ust@@ ri@@ an physic@@ ist in the 19@@ th century ."
And B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n &apos;s con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion was that he hel@@ ped us understand entropy .
You &apos;ve heard of entropy .
"It &apos;s the r@@ and@@ om@@ ness , the dis@@ order , the cha@@ ot@@ ic@@ ness of some sy@@ st@@ ems ."
B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n gave us a form@@ ul@@ a — en@@ grav@@ ed on his t@@ om@@ b@@ st@@ one now — that really quan@@ ti@@ f@@ ies what entropy is .
"And it &apos;s basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ents of a system so that you don &apos;t not@@ ice , so that ma@@ c@@ ro@@ s@@ co@@ pic@@ ally it looks the same ."
"If you have the air in this room , you don &apos;t not@@ ice each individ@@ ual at@@ om ."
A low entropy con@@ figura@@ tion is one in which there &apos;s only a few ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ements that look that way .
A high entropy ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ement is one that there are many ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ements that look that way .
"This is a c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ally important in@@ sight because it hel@@ ps us explain the second la@@ w of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics — the la@@ w that says that entropy increas@@ es in the universe , or in some is@@ ol@@ ated bit of the universe ."
The reason why entropy increas@@ es is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy .
"That &apos;s a wonderful in@@ sight , but it le@@ av@@ es something out ."
"This in@@ sight that entropy increas@@ es , by the way , is what &apos;s be@@ h@@ ind what we call the ar@@ row of time , the difference between the past and the future ."
"E@@ very difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increas@@ ing — the fact that you can remem@@ ber the past , but not the future ."
"The fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you di@@ e , always in that order , that &apos;s because entropy is increas@@ ing ."
"B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n expl@@ ained that if you start with low entropy , it &apos;s very natural for it to increase because there &apos;s more ways to be high entropy ."
What he didn &apos;t explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
"The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of the fact that the early universe was very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ."
We &apos;d like to understand that .
That &apos;s our job as c@@ osmo@@ log@@ ists .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it &apos;s actually not a problem that we &apos;ve been giving enough att@@ en@@ tion to ."
"It &apos;s not one of the first things people would say , if you asked a modern c@@ osmo@@ log@@ ist , &quot; What are the problems we &apos;re trying to ad@@ d@@ ress ? &quot;"
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was R@@ ich@@ ard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man .
"@@ 50 years ago , he gave a ser@@ ies of a bun@@ ch of different lec@@ tures ."
"He gave the popul@@ ar lec@@ tures that bec@@ ame &quot; &quot; The Ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter of P@@ h@@ ysic@@ al L@@ a@@ w . &quot; &quot; He gave lec@@ tures to C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h under@@ gra@@ ds that bec@@ ame &quot; &quot; The F@@ ey@@ n@@ man L@@ ec@@ tures on P@@ h@@ ysic@@ s . &quot; &quot; He gave lec@@ tures to C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h grad@@ u@@ ate students that bec@@ ame &quot; &quot; The F@@ ey@@ n@@ man L@@ ec@@ tures on G@@ rav@@ itation . &quot; &quot; In every one of these bo@@ o@@ ks , every one of these s@@ ets of lec@@ tures , he em@@ ph@@ as@@ iz@@ ed this p@@ uz@@ z@@ le : Why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?"
"So he says — I &apos;m not going to do the ac@@ cent — he says , &quot; &quot; F@@ or some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy cont@@ ent , and since then the entropy has increas@@ ed ."
The ar@@ row of time cannot be complet@@ ely underst@@ ood until the my@@ st@@ ery of the begin@@ n@@ ings of the history of the universe are re@@ duc@@ ed still f@@ ur@@ ther from spec@@ ul@@ ation to understanding . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s our job .
"We want to know — this is 50 years ago , &quot; &quot; S@@ ur@@ ely , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve fig@@ ured it out by now . &quot;"
It &apos;s not true that we &apos;ve fig@@ ured it out by now .
"The reason the problem has g@@ ot@@ ten worse , rather than better , is because in 19@@ 9@@ 8 we learned something c@@ ru@@ cial about the universe that we didn &apos;t know before ."
We learned that it &apos;s acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating .
The universe is not only exp@@ anding .
"If you look at the galax@@ y , it &apos;s mov@@ ing away ."
"If you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be mov@@ ing away fas@@ ter ."
Ind@@ ivid@@ ual galaxies are spe@@ ed@@ ing away from us fas@@ ter and fas@@ ter so we say the universe is acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating .
"@@ Un@@ like the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at le@@ ast have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy ."
It &apos;s just the idea that emp@@ ty space itself has energy .
"In every little c@@ ub@@ ic c@@ enti@@ me@@ ter of space , whether or not there &apos;s stuff , whether or not there &apos;s particles , matter , radi@@ ation or wh@@ at@@ ever , there &apos;s still energy , even in the space itself ."
"And this energy , acc@@ ord@@ ing to E@@ instein , ex@@ ert@@ s a p@@ ush on the universe ."
It is a per@@ p@@ et@@ ual im@@ pul@@ se that p@@ ush@@ es galaxies ap@@ art from each other .
"Because dark energy , un@@ like matter or radi@@ ation , does not dil@@ ute away as the universe ex@@ pan@@ ds ."
"The amount of energy in each c@@ ub@@ ic c@@ enti@@ me@@ ter re@@ main@@ s the same , even as the universe gets big@@ ger and big@@ ger ."
This has c@@ ru@@ cial im@@ plic@@ ations for what the universe is going to do in the future .
"For one thing , the universe will exp@@ and forever ."
"B@@ ack when I was your age , we didn &apos;t know what the universe was going to do ."
S@@ ome people thought that the universe would re@@ col@@ l@@ ap@@ se in the future .
E@@ instein was f@@ ond of this idea .
"But if there &apos;s dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep exp@@ anding forever and ever and ever ."
"@@ 14 billion years in the past , 100 billion do@@ g years , but an in@@ fin@@ ite number of years into the future ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , for all int@@ ents and pur@@ pos@@ es , space looks fin@@ ite to us ."
"S@@ p@@ ace may be fin@@ ite or in@@ fin@@ ite , but because the universe is acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see ."
"There &apos;s a fin@@ ite regi@@ on of space that we have acc@@ ess to , sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed by a horiz@@ on ."
"So even though time goes on forever , space is lim@@ ited to us ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , emp@@ ty space has a tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"In the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ a@@ w@@ king told us that a black h@@ ole , even though you think it &apos;s black , it actually em@@ its radi@@ ation when you take into ac@@ coun@@ t quantum me@@ chan@@ ics ."
"The cur@@ v@@ ature of sp@@ ac@@ e-@@ time around the black h@@ ole br@@ ings to life the quantum me@@ chan@@ ical fluctu@@ ation , and the black h@@ ole radi@@ ates ."
"A prec@@ is@@ ely si@@ mil@@ ar cal@@ cul@@ ation by H@@ a@@ w@@ king and G@@ ary G@@ ib@@ b@@ ons showed that if you have dark energy in emp@@ ty space , then the whole universe radi@@ ates ."
The energy of emp@@ ty space br@@ ings to life quantum fluctu@@ ations .
"And so even though the universe will last forever , and ordinary matter and radi@@ ation will dil@@ ute away , there will always be some radi@@ ation , some ther@@ mal fluctu@@ ations , even in emp@@ ty space ."
So what this means is that the universe is like a bo@@ x of ga@@ s that las@@ ts forever .
Well what is the im@@ plic@@ ation of that ?
That im@@ plic@@ ation was studi@@ ed by B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n back in the 19@@ th century .
"He said , well , entropy increas@@ es because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy ."
But that &apos;s a prob@@ abil@@ is@@ tic stat@@ ement .
"It will probably increase , and the prob@@ abil@@ ity is en@@ or@@ mo@@ us@@ ly hu@@ ge ."
It &apos;s not something you have to wor@@ ry about — the air in this room all ga@@ ther@@ ing over one part of the room and suf@@ f@@ oc@@ ating us .
"It &apos;s very , very un@@ lik@@ ely ."
"E@@ x@@ cept if they loc@@ ked the do@@ ors and ke@@ p@@ t us here liter@@ ally forever , that would happen ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing that is allowed , every con@@ figura@@ tion that is allowed to be ob@@ t@@ ained by the molecul@@ es in this room , would ev@@ ent@@ ually be ob@@ t@@ ained ."
"So B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n says , look , you could start with a universe that was in ther@@ mal equ@@ il@@ ib@@ ri@@ um ."
He didn &apos;t know about the Big Bang . He didn &apos;t know about the ex@@ pan@@ sion of the universe .
He thought that space and time were expl@@ ained by I@@ sa@@ ac Ne@@ w@@ ton — they were absol@@ ute ; they just st@@ uc@@ k there forever .
So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecul@@ es were just sp@@ read out ev@@ en@@ ly every@@ where — the everything molecul@@ es .
"But if you &apos;re B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n , you know that if you wa@@ it long enough , the ran@@ dom fluctu@@ ations of those molecul@@ es will occ@@ as@@ ion@@ ally bring them into lower entropy con@@ figura@@ tions ."
"And then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will exp@@ and back ."
"So it &apos;s not that entropy must always increase — you can get fluctu@@ ations into lower entropy , more organiz@@ ed sit@@ u@@ ations ."
"Well if that &apos;s true , B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n then goes on@@ to inv@@ ent two very moder@@ n@@ -@@ s@@ ou@@ nd@@ ing ideas — the multi@@ ver@@ se and the an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic princi@@ ple ."
"He says , the problem with ther@@ mal equ@@ il@@ ib@@ ri@@ um is that we can &apos;t live there ."
"@@ R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber , life itself dep@@ ends on the ar@@ row of time ."
"We would not be able to process information , met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ize , wal@@ k and talk , if we liv@@ ed in ther@@ mal equ@@ il@@ ib@@ ri@@ um ."
"So if you imagine a very , very big universe , an in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely big universe , with r@@ and@@ om@@ ly b@@ um@@ ping into each other particles , there will occ@@ as@@ ion@@ ally be small fluctu@@ ations in the lower entropy states , and then they rel@@ a@@ x back ."
But there will also be large fluctu@@ ations .
"O@@ c@@ c@@ as@@ ion@@ ally , you will make a planet or a star or a galax@@ y or a hundred billion galaxies ."
"So B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n says , we will only live in the part of the multi@@ ver@@ se , in the part of this in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely big set of fluctu@@ ating particles , where life is possible ."
That &apos;s the regi@@ on where entropy is low .
M@@ aybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time .
"Now your h@@ ome@@ work as@@ sign@@ ment is to really think about this , to cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate what it means ."
"C@@ ar@@ l S@@ a@@ gan once famo@@ us@@ ly said that &quot; &quot; in order to make an ap@@ ple pi@@ e , you must first inv@@ ent the universe . &quot; &quot; But he was not right ."
"In B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n &apos;s scen@@ ari@@ o , if you want to make an ap@@ ple pi@@ e , you just wa@@ it for the ran@@ dom mo@@ tion of atoms to make you an ap@@ ple pi@@ e ."
"That will happen much more fre@@ qu@@ ently than the ran@@ dom mo@@ tions of atoms making you an ap@@ ple or@@ ch@@ ard and some su@@ ga@@ r and an ov@@ en , and then making you an ap@@ ple pi@@ e ."
So this scen@@ ari@@ o makes predic@@ tions .
And the predic@@ tions are that the fluctu@@ ations that make us are min@@ ima@@ l .
"E@@ v@@ en if you imagine that this room we are in now ex@@ ists and is real and here we are , and we have , not only our me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es , but our im@@ pres@@ sion that outside there &apos;s something called C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h and the United States and the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y , it &apos;s much eas@@ i@@ er for all those im@@ pres@@ sions to r@@ and@@ om@@ ly fluctu@@ ate into your brain than for them actually to r@@ and@@ om@@ ly fluctu@@ ate into C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h , the United States and the galax@@ y ."
"The good news is that , ther@@ e@@ fore , this scen@@ ari@@ o does not work ; it is not right ."
This scen@@ ari@@ o predic@@ ts that we should be a min@@ ima@@ l fluctu@@ ation .
"E@@ v@@ en if you left our galax@@ y out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies ."
And F@@ ey@@ n@@ man also underst@@ ood this .
"F@@ ey@@ n@@ man says , &quot; &quot; F@@ rom the hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis that the world is a fluctu@@ ation , all the predic@@ tions are that if we look at a part of the world we &apos;ve never seen before , we will find it mi@@ x@@ ed up , and not like the piece we &apos;ve just looked at — high entropy ."
"If our order were d@@ ue to a fluctu@@ ation , we would not exp@@ ect order any@@ where but where we have just not@@ ic@@ ed it ."
We ther@@ e@@ fore con@@ cl@@ u@@ de the universe is not a fluctu@@ ation . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s good . The question is then what is the right answer ?
"If the universe is not a fluctu@@ ation , why did the early universe have a low entropy ?"
"And I would love to tell you the answer , but I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time ."
"( Laughter ) Here is the universe that we tell you about , ver@@ s@@ us the universe that really ex@@ ists ."
I just showed you this picture .
The universe is exp@@ anding for the last 10 billion years or so .
It &apos;s co@@ ol@@ ing off .
But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
"If the dark energy re@@ main@@ s around , the stars around us will use up their n@@ uc@@ lear fu@@ el , they will stop b@@ urn@@ ing ."
They will f@@ all into black hol@@ es .
We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black hol@@ es .
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years — a lot longer than our little universe has liv@@ ed .
The future is much longer than the past .
But even black hol@@ es don &apos;t last forever .
"They will ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ate , and we will be left with nothing but emp@@ ty space ."
That emp@@ ty space las@@ ts essenti@@ ally forever .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , you not@@ ice , since emp@@ ty space giv@@ es off radi@@ ation , there &apos;s actually ther@@ mal fluctu@@ ations , and it c@@ y@@ cles around all the different possible com@@ b@@ in@@ ations of the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ ed@@ om that ex@@ ist in emp@@ ty space ."
"So even though the universe las@@ ts forever , there &apos;s only a fin@@ ite number of things that can possi@@ bly happen in the universe ."
They all happen over a peri@@ od of time equal to 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years .
So here &apos;s two questions for you .
"@@ N@@ umb@@ er one : I@@ f the universe las@@ ts for 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years , why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it , in the war@@ m , com@@ for@@ table af@@ ter@@ gl@@ ow of the Big Bang ?"
Why ar@@ en &apos;t we in emp@@ ty space ?
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s nothing there to be liv@@ ing , &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not right ."
You could be a ran@@ dom fluctu@@ ation out of the no@@ thin@@ gn@@ ess .
Why ar@@ en &apos;t you ?
M@@ ore h@@ ome@@ work as@@ sign@@ ment for you .
"So like I said , I don &apos;t actually know the answer ."
I &apos;m going to give you my fav@@ or@@ ite scen@@ ari@@ o .
E@@ i@@ ther it &apos;s just like that . There is no ex@@ plan@@ ation .
This is a br@@ ute fact about the universe that you should learn to ac@@ cept and stop asking questions .
O@@ r maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe .
"A@@ n eg@@ g , an un@@ bro@@ ken eg@@ g , is a low entropy con@@ figura@@ tion , and yet , when we op@@ en our re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ or , we do not go , &quot; &quot; H@@ ah , how sur@@ pris@@ ing to find this low entropy con@@ figura@@ tion in our re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ or . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s because an eg@@ g is not a cl@@ os@@ ed system ; it comes out of a ch@@ ic@@ ken ."
M@@ aybe the universe comes out of a univer@@ sa@@ l ch@@ ic@@ ken .
"M@@ aybe there is something that nat@@ ur@@ ally , through the growth of the la@@ ws of physics , giv@@ es r@@ ise to universe like ours in low entropy con@@ figura@@ tions ."
"If that &apos;s true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much big@@ ger multi@@ ver@@ se ."
That &apos;s my fav@@ or@@ ite scen@@ ari@@ o .
So the organiz@@ ers asked me to end with a b@@ old spec@@ ul@@ ation .
M@@ y b@@ old spec@@ ul@@ ation is that I will be absol@@ ut@@ ely vin@@ dic@@ ated by history .
"And 50 years from now , all of my cur@@ r@@ ent w@@ il@@ d ideas will be ac@@ cep@@ ted as tr@@ u@@ ths by the sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic and ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al commun@@ ities ."
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larg@@ er multi@@ ver@@ se .
"And even better , we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to comp@@ are to observ@@ ations ."
This is a predic@@ tion . I might be wrong .
"But we &apos;ve been thinking as a human ra@@ ce about what the universe was like , why it came to be in the way it did for many , many years ."
It &apos;s exc@@ iting to think we may finally know the answer some@@ day .
Thank you .

The ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ al er@@ a started two secon@@ ds ago .
S@@ ome people would say it &apos;s technology .
"Now it &apos;s true , technology has acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ated through human history , and right now , technology adv@@ an@@ ces extre@@ m@@ ely ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly — that is the pro@@ x@@ i@@ mate cause , that &apos;s why we are cur@@ r@@ ently so very produc@@ tive ."
"If we look under the h@@ ood , this is what we find : basically the same thing ."
"One is a little larg@@ er , it maybe also has a few tric@@ ks in the ex@@ act way it &apos;s wi@@ red ."
"Th@@ ese inv@@ is@@ ible differ@@ ences cannot be too compl@@ ic@@ ated , h@@ ow@@ ever , because there have only been 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations since our last common an@@ c@@ est@@ or ."
We know that compl@@ ic@@ ated me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms take a long time to evol@@ ve .
"So this then seems pretty ob@@ vi@@ ous that everything we &apos;ve achi@@ ev@@ ed , and everything we care about , dep@@ ends c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ally on some relati@@ vely min@@ or changes that made the human mind ."
You would have human program@@ m@@ ers that would pain@@ st@@ ak@@ ing@@ ly h@@ and@@ c@@ raf@@ t kno@@ w@@ l@@ edge it@@ ems .
"But since then , a par@@ a@@ di@@ g@@ m shi@@ ft has taken place in the field of ar@@ ti@@ fici@@ al intelligence ."
"@@ To@@ day , the action is really around machine learning ."
"So rather than h@@ and@@ c@@ raf@@ ting kno@@ w@@ l@@ edge re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ations and fe@@ atures , we create alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms that learn , of@@ ten from ra@@ w per@@ cep@@ tu@@ al data ."
B@@ as@@ ically the same thing that the human in@@ f@@ ant does .
"Now of course , A@@ .@@ I@@ . is still no@@ where ne@@ ar having the same po@@ wer@@ ful , c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ do@@ ma@@ in abil@@ ity to learn and pl@@ an as a human being has ."
"Now , it could happen much , much later , or so@@ on@@ er , the tr@@ uth is nob@@ ody really kno@@ ws ."
This comes down to physics .
"A bi@@ ological neuro@@ n fir@@ es , maybe , at 200 h@@ ert@@ z , 200 times a second ."
But even a pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day trans@@ ist@@ or oper@@ ates at the G@@ i@@ ga@@ h@@ ert@@ z .
"@@ Ne@@ u@@ rons pro@@ pa@@ ga@@ te s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly in ax@@ ons , 100 met@@ ers per second , to@@ ps ."
"But in comput@@ ers , signals can tr@@ av@@ el at the spe@@ ed of light ."
"So the p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al for super@@ intelligence lies d@@ or@@ man@@ t in matter , much like the power of the at@@ om la@@ y d@@ or@@ man@@ t throu@@ gh@@ out human history , pati@@ ently wa@@ iting there until 19@@ 45 ."
And I think we might then see an intelligence expl@@ os@@ ion .
"And then , after many , many more years of really hard work , lots of inv@@ est@@ ment , maybe ev@@ ent@@ ually we get to ch@@ im@@ pan@@ ze@@ e-@@ level ar@@ ti@@ fici@@ al intelligence ."
"And then , after even more years of really , really hard work , we get to village id@@ iot ar@@ ti@@ fici@@ al intelligence ."
"And a few mo@@ ments later , we are be@@ y@@ ond E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The tra@@ in doesn &apos;t stop at H@@ um@@ an@@ vil@@ le St@@ ation .
"It &apos;s lik@@ ely , rather , to s@@ wo@@ os@@ h right by ."
"Now this has pro@@ found im@@ plic@@ ations , particul@@ arly when it comes to questions of power ."
"O@@ n@@ ce there is super@@ intelligence , the f@@ ate of hum@@ an@@ ity may dep@@ end on what the super@@ intelligence does ."
Th@@ ink about it : M@@ ach@@ ine intelligence is the last inv@@ en@@ tion that hum@@ an@@ ity will ever need to make .
"M@@ ach@@ ines will then be better at inv@@ ent@@ ing than we are , and they &apos;ll be doing so on di@@ g@@ ital tim@@ es@@ cal@@ es ."
What this means is basically a t@@ el@@ es@@ co@@ ping of the future .
"A@@ ll of this super@@ intelligence could devel@@ op , and possi@@ bly quite ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly ."
"Now , a super@@ intelligence with such techn@@ ological mat@@ ur@@ ity would be extre@@ m@@ ely po@@ wer@@ ful , and at le@@ ast in some scen@@ ari@@ os , it would be able to get what it wan@@ ts ."
We would then have a future that would be shap@@ ed by the pre@@ fer@@ ences of this A@@ .@@ I@@ .
Here it gets tric@@ ki@@ er .
"T@@ o make any he@@ ad@@ way with this , we must first of all av@@ o@@ id an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ mor@@ ph@@ iz@@ ing ."
"And this is i@@ ron@@ ic because every new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ar@@ tic@@ le about the future of A@@ .@@ I@@ . has a picture of this : So I think what we need to do is to con@@ ce@@ ive of the issue more ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tly , not in terms of v@@ iv@@ id H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ ood scen@@ ari@@ os ."
"We need to think of intelligence as an op@@ ti@@ miz@@ ation process , a process that ste@@ ers the future into a particular set of con@@ figura@@ tions ."
A super@@ intelligence is a really strong op@@ ti@@ miz@@ ation process .
"This means that there is no nec@@ ess@@ ary connec@@ tion between being high@@ ly intellig@@ ent in this sense , and having an ob@@ jec@@ tive that we hum@@ ans would find wor@@ th@@ while or me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful ."
S@@ up@@ pose we give an A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to make hum@@ ans s@@ mil@@ e .
"When the A@@ .@@ I@@ . becom@@ es super@@ intellig@@ ent , it realiz@@ es that there is a more ef@@ fec@@ tive way to achi@@ eve this go@@ al : take contro@@ l of the world and s@@ tic@@ k elec@@ tro@@ des into the f@@ aci@@ al mus@@ cles of hum@@ ans to cause con@@ st@@ ant , be@@ am@@ ing gr@@ ins ."
"A@@ n@@ other example , sup@@ pose we give A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to sol@@ ve a difficult ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical problem ."
This is a les@@ son that &apos;s also t@@ au@@ ght in many a my@@ th .
"He tou@@ ch@@ es his daughter , she turns into g@@ old ."
"Now you might say , if a computer star@@ ts s@@ tic@@ king elec@@ tro@@ des into people &apos;s fac@@ es , we &apos;d just sh@@ ut it off ."
"A , this is not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily so easy to do if we &apos;ve gro@@ wn dep@@ end@@ ent on the system — like , where is the off s@@ wit@@ ch to the Inter@@ net ?"
They cert@@ ain@@ ly had reas@@ ons .
"The point is , we should not be con@@ f@@ ident that we have this under contro@@ l here ."
"So we dis@@ con@@ n@@ ect the e@@ ther@@ net c@@ able to create an air ga@@ p , but again , like mer@@ ely human h@@ ac@@ k@@ ers ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely trans@@ g@@ ress air g@@ aps using social engine@@ er@@ ing ."
"M@@ ore cre@@ ative scen@@ ari@@ os are also possible , like if you &apos;re the A@@ .@@ I@@ . , you can imagine w@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing elec@@ tro@@ des around in your inter@@ n@@ al cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry to create radi@@ o w@@ av@@ es that you can use to commun@@ ic@@ ate ."
"S@@ o@@ on@@ er or later , it will out ."
I see no way around this difficult problem .
"Now , I &apos;m actually fa@@ ir@@ ly op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic that this problem can be sol@@ ved ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , we would create an A@@ .@@ I@@ . that us@@ es its intelligence to learn what we val@@ ue , and its mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation system is con@@ struc@@ ted in such a way that it is mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated to pur@@ su@@ e our val@@ ues or to per@@ form ac@@ tions that it predic@@ ts we would appro@@ ve of ."
We would th@@ us l@@ ever@@ age its intelligence as much as possible to sol@@ ve the problem of val@@ u@@ e-@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing .
The in@@ iti@@ al con@@ diti@@ ons for the intelligence expl@@ os@@ ion might need to be set up in just the right way if we are to have a contro@@ l@@ led det@@ on@@ ation .
Here is the wor@@ ry : M@@ ak@@ ing super@@ intellig@@ ent A@@ .@@ I@@ . is a really hard challenge .
"So I think that we should work out a sol@@ ution to the contro@@ l problem in adv@@ ance , so that we have it av@@ a@@ il@@ able by the time it is needed ."
"This to me looks like a thing that is well wor@@ th doing and I can imagine that if things turn out ok@@ ay , that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mat@@ tered was to get this thing right ."
"@@ Not your@@ s , of course — other people &apos;s ."
So I decided to try and w@@ r@@ ite something more fu@@ n .
And I came up with an idea that I would w@@ r@@ ite a co@@ ok@@ bo@@ ok .
Can any@@ body see anything but the left one being longer ?
"If I c@@ over the rest of the cu@@ be , you can see that they are id@@ en@@ tical ."
V@@ is@@ ion is one of the best things we do .
"So I want to show you some c@@ ogn@@ itive ill@@ us@@ ions , or dec@@ is@@ ion@@ -@@ making ill@@ us@@ ions , in the same way ."
"@@ G@@ er@@ many is on the left , and A@@ u@@ str@@ ia is on the right ."
"The Ne@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds is on the left , and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um is on the right ."
"@@ People don &apos;t ch@@ ec@@ k , and they don &apos;t jo@@ in ."
"( Laughter ) Now , think about what this means ."
"A@@ ll these medic@@ ations , nothing seems to be working ."
What do you do ? Do you pul@@ l the pati@@ ent back and try ib@@ u@@ prof@@ en ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple of more exam@@ pl@@ es on ir@@ ra@@ tional dec@@ is@@ ion@@ -@@ making .
"Now , we@@ ek@@ end in P@@ aris , we@@ ek@@ end in R@@ ome — these are different things ."
"If you want co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , you have to pa@@ y for it yourself , it &apos;s two e@@ u@@ ros 50 ."
This is why we have these f@@ our@@ -@@ min@@ ute da@@ t@@ es .
"I &apos;ll show you imag@@ es here , no real people , but the experiment was with people ."
"I showed some people a picture of Tom , and a picture of J@@ er@@ ry ."
"@@ and I said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o do you want to da@@ te ?"
"And the question was , will ug@@ ly J@@ er@@ ry and ug@@ ly Tom help their re@@ spec@@ tive , more at@@ trac@@ tive bro@@ thers ?"
Now you get it .
&quot; What a piece of work is a man ! How nob@@ le in reason ! &quot;
"A@@ re we Su@@ per@@ man , or are we H@@ om@@ er S@@ im@@ p@@ son ?"
( Applause )
But they didn &apos;t rel@@ ease their energy in light .
"Now , most people thought they were n@@ ut@@ s ."
And they pas@@ sed through you and me .
And they pas@@ sed through the det@@ ec@@ tor .
"You know , it was the pa@@ yof@@ f of my c@@ are@@ er , basically ."
That &apos;s why everyone thought the L@@ I@@ G@@ O people were n@@ ut@@ s .
A@@ u@@ di@@ ble sound has a w@@ av@@ el@@ en@@ g@@ th that can be up to 50 fe@@ et long .
That &apos;s Al@@ ice talking .
That &apos;s B@@ ob inter@@ r@@ up@@ ting .
S@@ il@@ ly B@@ ob .
"So , the same is true of grav@@ it@@ ati@@ onal w@@ av@@ es ."
We can &apos;t use them to make simple imag@@ es of things out in the Un@@ iver@@ se .
It &apos;s sort of the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of sp@@ in im@@ prin@@ ted on this w@@ av@@ e@@ form .
It &apos;s f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic .
And we know it because we heard it .
That &apos;s the las@@ ting impor@@ tan@@ ce of L@@ I@@ G@@ O .
"W@@ it@@ h grav@@ it@@ ati@@ onal w@@ av@@ es , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning ."
"@@ P@@ lan@@ et@@ ary sy@@ st@@ ems outside our own are like dis@@ tant c@@ ities wh@@ ose li@@ ghts we can see tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing , but wh@@ ose stre@@ ets we can &apos;t wal@@ k ."
"B@@ y stud@@ ying those tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing li@@ ghts though , we can learn about how stars and planets inter@@ act to form their own ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem and make h@@ ab@@ it@@ at@@ s that are am@@ en@@ able to life ."
"In this imag@@ e of the To@@ k@@ y@@ o sk@@ y@@ line , I &apos;ve h@@ id@@ den data from the new@@ est plan@@ et@@ -@@ h@@ un@@ ting space t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e on the b@@ loc@@ k , the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er M@@ is@@ sion ."
Can you see it ?
There we go .
"This is just a tiny part of the sk@@ y the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er star@@ es at , where it se@@ arch@@ es for planets by meas@@ uring the light from over 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 stars , all at once , every half h@@ our , and very prec@@ is@@ ely ."
And what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny di@@ m@@ ming of light that is c@@ a@@ used by a planet pas@@ sing in fron@@ t of one of these stars and b@@ loc@@ king some of that star@@ light from getting to us .
"In just over two years of oper@@ ations , we &apos;ve found over 1@@ ,@@ 200 p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al new plan@@ et@@ ary sy@@ st@@ ems around other stars ."
"T@@ o give you some per@@ spec@@ tive , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous two dec@@ ad@@ es of se@@ arch@@ ing , we had only known about 4@@ 00 pri@@ or to K@@ e@@ pl@@ er ."
"When we see these little di@@ ps in the light , we can de@@ ter@@ min@@ e a number of things ."
"For one thing , we can de@@ ter@@ min@@ e that there &apos;s a planet there , but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its par@@ ent star ."
That dis@@ tan@@ ce is really important because it t@@ ells us how much light the planet re@@ ce@@ iv@@ es over@@ all .
"And that dis@@ tan@@ ce and kno@@ wing that amount of light is important because it &apos;s a little like you or I sit@@ ting around a cam@@ p@@ fire : You want to be cl@@ ose enough to the cam@@ p@@ fire so that you &apos;re war@@ m , but not so cl@@ ose that you &apos;re too to@@ as@@ ty and you get b@@ urn@@ ed ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , there &apos;s more to know about your par@@ ent star than just how much light you re@@ ce@@ ive over@@ all ."
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Sun .
It &apos;s sho@@ wn here in vis@@ ible light .
That &apos;s the light that you can see with your own human ey@@ es .
You &apos;ll not@@ ice that it looks pretty much like the ic@@ on@@ ic y@@ ell@@ ow b@@ all — that Sun that we all dra@@ w when we &apos;re children .
"But you &apos;ll not@@ ice something else , and that &apos;s that the face of the Sun has f@@ rec@@ k@@ les ."
"Th@@ ese f@@ rec@@ k@@ les are called s@@ un@@ sp@@ ots , and they are just one of the man@@ if@@ est@@ ations of the Sun &apos;s magnetic field ."
They also cause the light from the star to v@@ ary .
"And we can measure this very , very prec@@ is@@ ely with K@@ e@@ pl@@ er and tra@@ ce their ef@@ fec@@ ts ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , these are just the ti@@ p of the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g ."
"If we had U@@ V ey@@ es or X@@ -@@ ra@@ y ey@@ es , we would really see the d@@ y@@ na@@ mic and dra@@ ma@@ tic ef@@ fec@@ ts of our Sun &apos;s magnetic acti@@ vity — the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well ."
"@@ Just think , even when it &apos;s cl@@ ou@@ d@@ y outside , these kind of ev@@ ents are happening in the sk@@ y ab@@ ove you all the time ."
"So when we want to learn whether a planet is h@@ ab@@ it@@ able , whether it might be am@@ en@@ able to life , we want to know not only how much tot@@ al light it re@@ ce@@ iv@@ es and how war@@ m it is , but we want to know about its space we@@ a@@ ther — this high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation , the U@@ V and the X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys that are created by its star and that b@@ a@@ the it in this b@@ ath of high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation ."
"And so , we can &apos;t really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of deta@@ il that we can look at planets in our own solar system ."
"I &apos;m sho@@ wing here V@@ en@@ us , Earth and M@@ ars — three planets in our own solar system that are rou@@ gh@@ ly the same si@@ ze , but only one of which is really a good place to live ."
But what we can do in the me@@ an@@ time is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relation@@ ship between the planets and their par@@ ent stars to sus@@ s out cl@@ ues about which planets might be good plac@@ es to look for life in the universe .
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er won &apos;t find a planet around every single star it looks at .
"But really , every meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment it makes is pre@@ ci@@ ous , because it &apos;s teach@@ ing us about the relation@@ ship between stars and planets , and how it &apos;s really the star@@ light that s@@ ets the st@@ age for the forma@@ tion of life in the universe ."
"Wh@@ ile it &apos;s K@@ e@@ pl@@ er the t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e , the in@@ str@@ ument that star@@ es , it &apos;s we , life , who are se@@ arch@@ ing ."
Thank you .

"A human child is born , and for quite a long time is a cons@@ um@@ er ."
It cannot be con@@ sci@@ ously a con@@ trib@@ ut@@ or .
It is hel@@ pl@@ ess .
"It doesn &apos;t know how to surv@@ ive , even though it is en@@ do@@ wed with an inst@@ inc@@ t to surv@@ ive ."
"It need@@ s the help of mother , or a f@@ os@@ ter mother , to surv@@ ive ."
It can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d to d@@ ou@@ b@@ t the person who t@@ ends the child .
"It has to tot@@ ally sur@@ r@@ end@@ er , as one sur@@ r@@ end@@ ers to an an@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ olog@@ ist ."
It has to tot@@ ally sur@@ r@@ end@@ er .
That im@@ p@@ lies a lot of trust .
That im@@ p@@ lies the tr@@ ust@@ ed person won &apos;t viol@@ ate the trust .
"As the child gro@@ ws , it begin@@ s to disc@@ over that the person tr@@ ust@@ ed is viol@@ ating the trust ."
"It doesn &apos;t know even the word &quot; &quot; viol@@ ation . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ere@@ fore , it has to bl@@ ame itself , a wor@@ dl@@ ess bl@@ ame , which is more difficult to really res@@ ol@@ ve — the wor@@ dl@@ ess self-@@ bl@@ ame ."
"As the child gro@@ ws to become an ad@@ ult : so far , it has been a cons@@ um@@ er , but the growth of a human being lies in his or her cap@@ ac@@ ity to con@@ trib@@ ute , to be a con@@ trib@@ ut@@ or ."
"One cannot con@@ trib@@ ute un@@ less one fe@@ els sec@@ ure , one fe@@ els big , one fe@@ els : I have enough ."
T@@ o be compas@@ sion@@ ate is not a jo@@ ke .
It &apos;s not that simple .
One has to disc@@ over a certain b@@ ign@@ ess in on@@ es@@ elf .
"That b@@ ign@@ ess should be cen@@ tered on on@@ es@@ elf , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wi@@ el@@ d , not in terms of any stat@@ us that you can com@@ m@@ and in the society , but it should be cen@@ tered on on@@ es@@ elf ."
The self : you are self-@@ a@@ w@@ are .
"O@@ n that self , it should be cen@@ tered — a b@@ ign@@ ess , a wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess ."
"O@@ ther@@ w@@ ise , compassion is just a word and a dre@@ am ."
"You can be compas@@ sion@@ ate occ@@ as@@ ion@@ ally , more mov@@ ed by em@@ pa@@ thy than by compassion ."
Thank G@@ od we are em@@ pa@@ the@@ tic .
"When somebody &apos;s in pain , we pic@@ k up the pain ."
"In a W@@ im@@ bl@@ ed@@ on fin@@ al mat@@ ch , these two gu@@ ys fi@@ ght it out ."
E@@ ach one has got two gam@@ es .
It can be any@@ body &apos;s game .
What they have swe@@ ated so far has no me@@ an@@ ing .
One person w@@ ins .
"The t@@ en@@ nis e@@ ti@@ qu@@ et@@ te is , both the play@@ ers have to come to the net and sh@@ ake h@@ ands ."
"The w@@ in@@ ner bo@@ x@@ es the air and k@@ is@@ ses the ground , th@@ ro@@ ws his shir@@ t as though somebody is wa@@ iting for it ."
( Laughter ) And this guy has to come to the net .
"When he comes to the net , you see , his whole face changes ."
It looks as though he &apos;s wi@@ sh@@ ing that he didn &apos;t w@@ in .
Why ? E@@ m@@ pa@@ thy .
That &apos;s human heart .
No human heart is den@@ i@@ ed of that em@@ pa@@ thy .
No relig@@ ion can demo@@ l@@ ish that by indo@@ c@@ tr@@ in@@ ation .
"@@ No culture , no na@@ tion and na@@ tion@@ al@@ ism — nothing can tou@@ ch it because it is em@@ pa@@ thy ."
"And that cap@@ ac@@ ity to em@@ pa@@ th@@ ize is the w@@ ind@@ ow through which you re@@ ach out to people , you do something that makes a difference in somebody &apos;s life — even words , even time ."
C@@ om@@ pas@@ sion is not defin@@ ed in one form .
There &apos;s no In@@ dian compassion .
There &apos;s no American compassion .
"It trans@@ c@@ ends na@@ tion , the gen@@ der , the age ."
Why ? Because it is there in everybody .
It &apos;s experienc@@ ed by people occ@@ as@@ ion@@ ally .
"Th@@ en this occ@@ asi@@ onal compassion , we are not talking about — it will never re@@ ma@@ in occ@@ asi@@ onal ."
"B@@ y man@@ da@@ te , you cannot make a person compas@@ sion@@ ate ."
"You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase love me . &quot; &quot; L@@ ove is something you disc@@ over ."
"It &apos;s not an action , but in the English language , it is also an action ."
I will come to it later .
So one has got to disc@@ over a certain wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess .
"I am going to c@@ ite the possibil@@ ity of being whole , which is within our experience , everybody &apos;s experience ."
"In sp@@ ite of a very tra@@ g@@ ic life , one is happy in mo@@ ments which are very few and far between ."
"And the one who is happy , even for a sl@@ ap@@ s@@ tic@@ k jo@@ ke , ac@@ cep@@ ts h@@ im@@ self and also the s@@ che@@ me of things in which one fin@@ ds on@@ es@@ elf ."
"That means the whole universe , known things and un@@ known things ."
A@@ ll of them are tot@@ ally ac@@ cep@@ ted because you disc@@ over your wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess in yourself .
"The sub@@ ject — &quot; &quot; me &quot; &quot; — and the ob@@ ject — the s@@ che@@ me of things — f@@ use into on@@ en@@ ess , an experience nob@@ ody can say , &quot; &quot; I am den@@ i@@ ed of , &quot; &quot; an experience common to all and s@@ und@@ ry ."
"That experience con@@ fir@@ ms that , in sp@@ ite of all your lim@@ it@@ ations — all your wan@@ ts , des@@ ir@@ es , un@@ ful@@ fil@@ led , and the cre@@ dit car@@ ds and la@@ yof@@ f@@ s and , finally , bal@@ d@@ ness — you can be happy ."
But the ext@@ en@@ sion of the log@@ ic is that you don &apos;t need to ful@@ f@@ ill your des@@ ire to be happy .
"You are the very happiness , the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess that you want to be ."
"There &apos;s no cho@@ ice in this : that only con@@ fir@@ ms the reality that the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess cannot be different from you , cannot be min@@ us you ."
It has got to be you .
You cannot be a part of wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess and still be whole .
"@@ Y@@ our moment of happiness re@@ ve@@ als that reality , that realiz@@ ation , that rec@@ ognition : &quot; &quot; M@@ aybe I am the whole ."
M@@ aybe the s@@ w@@ ami is right .
M@@ aybe the s@@ w@@ ami is right . &quot; &quot; You start your new life .
Th@@ en everything becom@@ es me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful .
I have no more reason to bl@@ ame myself .
"If one has to bl@@ ame on@@ es@@ elf , one has a million reas@@ ons pl@@ us many ."
"But if I say , in sp@@ ite of my body being lim@@ ited — if it is black it is not wh@@ ite , if it is wh@@ ite it is not black : body is lim@@ ited any which way you look at it . L@@ im@@ ited ."
"@@ Y@@ our kno@@ w@@ l@@ edge is lim@@ ited , health is lim@@ ited , and power is ther@@ e@@ fore lim@@ ited , and the che@@ er@@ ful@@ ness is going to be lim@@ ited ."
C@@ om@@ pas@@ sion is going to be lim@@ ited .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing is going to be lim@@ it@@ less .
"You cannot com@@ m@@ and compassion un@@ less you become lim@@ it@@ less , and nob@@ ody can become lim@@ it@@ less , e@@ i@@ ther you are or you are not . P@@ er@@ i@@ od ."
And there is no way of your being not lim@@ it@@ less too .
"@@ Y@@ our own experience re@@ ve@@ als , in sp@@ ite of all lim@@ it@@ ations , you are the whole ."
And the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess is the reality of you when you rel@@ ate to the world .
It is love first .
"When you rel@@ ate to the world , the d@@ y@@ na@@ mic man@@ if@@ est@@ ation of the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess is , what we say , love ."
And itself becom@@ es compassion if the ob@@ ject that you rel@@ ate to ev@@ ok@@ es that emo@@ tion .
"Th@@ en that again trans@@ for@@ ms into giving , into shar@@ ing ."
You ex@@ pres@@ s yourself because you have compassion .
"T@@ o disc@@ over compassion , you need to be compas@@ sion@@ ate ."
"T@@ o disc@@ over the cap@@ ac@@ ity to give and share , you need to be giving and shar@@ ing ."
There is no shor@@ t@@ c@@ ut : it is like s@@ w@@ im@@ ming by s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
You learn s@@ w@@ im@@ ming by s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
You cannot learn s@@ w@@ im@@ ming on a fo@@ am mat@@ t@@ ress and en@@ ter into water .
( Laughter ) You learn s@@ w@@ im@@ ming by s@@ w@@ im@@ ming . You learn c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing by c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing .
"You learn co@@ o@@ king by co@@ o@@ king , having some sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic people around you to e@@ at what you co@@ ok ."
"( Laughter ) And , ther@@ e@@ fore , what I say , you have to f@@ ake it and make it . ( Laughter )"
You need to .
M@@ y pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or me@@ ant that .
You have to act it out .
You have to act compas@@ sion@@ ately .
"There is no ver@@ b for compassion , but you have an ad@@ ver@@ b for compassion ."
That &apos;s interesting to me .
You act compas@@ sion@@ ately .
"But then , how to act compas@@ sion@@ ately if you don &apos;t have compassion ?"
That is where you f@@ ake .
You f@@ ake it and make it . This is the man@@ t@@ ra of the United States of America .
( Laughter ) You f@@ ake it and make it .
"You act compas@@ sion@@ ately as though you have compassion : gr@@ ind your te@@ et@@ h , take all the sup@@ port system ."
"If you know how to pra@@ y , pra@@ y ."
A@@ s@@ k for compassion .
Let me act compas@@ sion@@ ately .
Do it .
"You &apos;ll disc@@ over compassion and also s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly a relati@@ ve compassion , and s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , perhaps if you get the right teach@@ ing , you &apos;ll disc@@ over compassion is a d@@ y@@ na@@ mic man@@ if@@ est@@ ation of the reality of yourself , which is on@@ en@@ ess , wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess , and that &apos;s what you are ."
"W@@ it@@ h these words , th@@ ank you very much ."

How does the news shape the way we see the world ?
Here &apos;s the world based on the way it looks — based on l@@ and@@ mas@@ s .
And here &apos;s how news shap@@ es what Americ@@ ans see .
"This ma@@ p — ( Applause ) — this ma@@ p sho@@ ws the number of secon@@ ds that American n@@ et@@ work and c@@ able news organiz@@ ations de@@ dic@@ ated to news stories , by country , in F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary of 200@@ 7 — just one year ago ."
"Now , this was a mon@@ th when N@@ or@@ th K@@ or@@ ea ag@@ re@@ ed to dis@@ man@@ tle its n@@ uc@@ lear fac@@ il@@ ities ."
There was mas@@ sive flo@@ od@@ ing in Ind@@ on@@ es@@ ia .
"And in P@@ aris , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C rel@@ eas@@ ed its study con@@ fir@@ ming man &apos;s im@@ p@@ act on global war@@ ming ."
The U.S. ac@@ coun@@ ted for 7@@ 9 percent of tot@@ al news c@@ over@@ age .
"And when we take out the U.S. and look at the re@@ main@@ ing 2@@ 1 percent , we see a lot of I@@ ra@@ q — that &apos;s that big gre@@ en thing there — and little else ."
"The com@@ b@@ ined c@@ over@@ age of R@@ us@@ s@@ ia , China and India , for example , re@@ ach@@ ed just one percent ."
"When we anal@@ y@@ z@@ ed all the news stories and re@@ mov@@ ed just one story , here &apos;s how the world looked ."
What was that story ? The de@@ ath of A@@ n@@ na N@@ ic@@ ole S@@ mit@@ h .
"This story ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed every country ex@@ cept I@@ ra@@ q , and re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed 10 times the c@@ over@@ age of the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ port ."
"And the c@@ y@@ cle contin@@ ues ; as we all know , Brit@@ ney has lo@@ om@@ ed pretty large l@@ ately ."
"So , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?"
One reason is that news n@@ et@@ works have re@@ duc@@ ed the number of their for@@ e@@ ign bu@@ re@@ a@@ us by half .
"A@@ side from on@@ e-@@ person A@@ B@@ C min@@ i@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ a@@ us in N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i , New D@@ el@@ h@@ i and M@@ umb@@ ai , there are no n@@ et@@ work news bu@@ re@@ a@@ us in all of A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , India or S@@ ou@@ th America — plac@@ es that are home to more than two billion people ."
The reality is that c@@ over@@ ing Brit@@ ney is che@@ ap@@ er .
And this l@@ ack of global c@@ over@@ age is all the more dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing when we see where people go for news .
"@@ L@@ oc@@ al T@@ V news lo@@ oms large , and un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately only de@@ dic@@ ates 12 percent of its c@@ over@@ age to inter@@ national news ."
And what about the w@@ eb ?
The most popul@@ ar news sit@@ es don &apos;t do much better .
"@@ L@@ ast year , P@@ ew and the C@@ ol@@ om@@ b@@ ia J@@ -@@ S@@ cho@@ ol anal@@ y@@ z@@ ed the 1@@ 4@@ ,000 stories that ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed on Go@@ og@@ le Ne@@ ws &apos; fron@@ t p@@ age ."
"And they , in fact , c@@ over@@ ed the same 2@@ 4 news ev@@ ents ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , a study in e-@@ cont@@ ent showed that much of global news from U.S. news cre@@ at@@ ors is rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed stories from the A@@ P w@@ ire ser@@ vic@@ es and R@@ e@@ ut@@ ers , and don &apos;t put things into a cont@@ ex@@ t that people can understand their connec@@ tion to it ."
"So , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today &apos;s college grad@@ u@@ ates , as well as less educ@@ ated Americ@@ ans , know less about the world than their coun@@ ter@@ parts did 20 years ago ."
"And if you think it &apos;s simply because we are not interes@@ ted , you would be wrong ."
"In rec@@ ent years , Americ@@ ans who say they cl@@ os@@ ely fol@@ low global news most of the time gre@@ w to over 50 percent ."
The real question : is this dis@@ t@@ or@@ ted wor@@ l@@ d@@ view what we want for Americ@@ ans in our increas@@ ing@@ ly inter@@ connec@@ ted world ?
I know we can do better .
And can we af@@ for@@ d not to ? Thank you .
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
The domin@@ ant kind of s@@ nob@@ b@@ ery that ex@@ ists no@@ w@@ ada@@ ys is job s@@ nob@@ b@@ ery .
I don &apos;t think we are particul@@ arly materi@@ al@@ is@@ tic .
So that &apos;s another way in which something quite positive can have a n@@ as@@ ty k@@ ic@@ k@@ back .
"And it &apos;s , again , l@@ in@@ ked to something n@@ ice ."
And that makes fail@@ ure seem much more c@@ r@@ ush@@ ing .
"That &apos;s ex@@ h@@ il@@ ar@@ ating if you &apos;re doing well , and very c@@ r@@ ush@@ ing if you &apos;re not ."
"This idea that everybody des@@ er@@ ves to get where they get to , I think it &apos;s a cra@@ z@@ y idea , complet@@ ely cra@@ z@@ y ."
"There are simply too many ran@@ dom fac@@ tors : acc@@ id@@ ents , acc@@ id@@ ents of bir@@ th , acc@@ id@@ ents of things dro@@ p@@ ping on people &apos;s he@@ ad@@ s , ill@@ n@@ ess@@ es , et@@ c ."
"That is an un@@ known part of them , and we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be@@ have as though it is known ."
I gave them the pl@@ ot@@ line of M@@ ada@@ me B@@ ov@@ ary .
"( Applause ) In a way , if you like , at one end of the spec@@ tr@@ um of sym@@ pa@@ thy , you &apos;ve got the t@@ ab@@ lo@@ id new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ."
"The other thing about modern society and why it c@@ a@@ us@@ es this an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , is that we have nothing at its center that is n@@ on@@ -@@ human ."
"It &apos;s an es@@ cap@@ e from our own comp@@ et@@ ition , and our own dra@@ mas ."
What I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is success and fail@@ ure .
"When we &apos;re told that ban@@ king is a very re@@ spec@@ table profes@@ sion , a lot of us want to go into ban@@ king ."
"When ban@@ king is no longer so re@@ spec@@ table , we l@@ ose inter@@ est in ban@@ king ."
"But what I really want to st@@ ress is : by all means , success , y@@ es ."
But let &apos;s ac@@ cept the stran@@ gen@@ ess of some of our ideas .
Thank you very much .
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
"Now I know we learned that in mat@@ h clas@@ s , but now it &apos;s every@@ where in the culture — The X pri@@ ze , the X@@ -@@ F@@ il@@ es , P@@ ro@@ ject X , TE@@ D@@ x ."
Wh@@ ere &apos;d that come from ?
"A@@ b@@ out six years ago I decided that I would learn A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic , which turns out to be a su@@ pre@@ m@@ ely log@@ ical language ."
"T@@ o w@@ r@@ ite a word or a ph@@ ra@@ se or a s@@ ent@@ ence in A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic is like c@@ raf@@ ting an equ@@ ation , because every part is extre@@ m@@ ely prec@@ ise and car@@ ri@@ es a lot of information ."
That &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as W@@ es@@ tern science and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics and engine@@ er@@ ing was really worked out in the first few centur@@ ies of the C@@ om@@ mon E@@ ra by the P@@ er@@ si@@ ans and the A@@ ra@@ b@@ s and the T@@ ur@@ ks .
This in@@ cl@@ ud@@ es the little system in A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic called al-@@ j@@ eb@@ ra .
And al-@@ j@@ eb@@ r rou@@ gh@@ ly trans@@ l@@ ates to &quot; the system for re@@ con@@ cil@@ ing dis@@ par@@ ate parts . &quot;
Al@@ -@@ j@@ eb@@ r finally came into English as alg@@ eb@@ ra .
One example amo@@ n@@ g many .
The A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic t@@ ex@@ ts cont@@ ain@@ ing this ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical w@@ is@@ dom finally made their way to Eu@@ rop@@ e — which is to say S@@ pain — in the 1@@ 1@@ th and 1@@ 2@@ th centur@@ ies .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some s@@ oun@@ ds in A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic that just don &apos;t make it through a Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an vo@@ ice bo@@ x without lots of pra@@ c@@ tice .
Tr@@ ust me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the cul@@ pr@@ its .
"This is the l@@ et@@ ter S@@ H@@ e@@ en , and it makes the sound we think of as S@@ H — &quot; &quot; sh . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s also the very first l@@ et@@ ter of the word sh@@ al@@ an , which means &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; just like the the English word &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; — some un@@ defin@@ ed , un@@ known thing ."
"Now in A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic , we can make this defin@@ ite by ad@@ ding the defin@@ ite ar@@ tic@@ le &quot; &quot; al . &quot; &quot; So this is al-@@ sh@@ al@@ an — the un@@ known thing ."
"And this is a word that ap@@ pe@@ ars throu@@ gh@@ out early ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics , such as this 10@@ th century der@@ iv@@ ation of pro@@ of@@ s ."
"The problem for the M@@ e@@ di@@ ev@@ al S@@ pan@@ ish s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ars who were t@@ asked with trans@@ l@@ ating this material is that the l@@ et@@ ter S@@ H@@ e@@ en and the word sh@@ al@@ an can &apos;t be r@@ end@@ er@@ ed into S@@ pan@@ ish because S@@ pan@@ ish doesn &apos;t have that S@@ H , that &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; sound ."
"So by con@@ ven@@ tion , they created a rul@@ e in which they bor@@ ro@@ wed the C@@ K sound , &quot; &quot; c@@ k &quot; &quot; sound , from the clas@@ sic@@ al G@@ re@@ e@@ k in the form of the l@@ et@@ ter K@@ ai ."
"@@ L@@ ater when this material was trans@@ l@@ ated into a common Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an language , which is to say L@@ ati@@ n , they simply re@@ plac@@ ed the G@@ re@@ e@@ k K@@ ai with the L@@ ati@@ n X@@ ."
"And once that happened , once this material was in L@@ ati@@ n , it form@@ ed the bas@@ is for ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics t@@ ext@@ bo@@ o@@ ks for almost 6@@ 00 years ."
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the un@@ known ? X is the un@@ known
because you can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; in S@@ pan@@ ish .
( Laughter ) And I thought that was wor@@ th shar@@ ing .
( Applause )
So it doesn &apos;t matter wh@@ ats@@ o@@ ever .
"Th@@ en she se@@ es the other one getting grap@@ e , and you will see what happens ."
"But until rec@@ ently , we have had little idea about the in@@ iti@@ al con@@ diti@@ ons for the universe ."
"This answer took seven minutes , and really gave me an in@@ sight into the incredible act of gener@@ os@@ ity this whole talk was for TE@@ D ."
S@@ ome of those re@@ for@@ ms have been good .
And we know why kids drop out .
We know why kids don &apos;t learn .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one in this room has been af@@ fec@@ ted by a teacher or an ad@@ ult .
I have looked at the best and I &apos;ve looked at some of the wor@@ st .
"@@ Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , it was ."
You ever thought about that ?
"I am po@@ wer@@ ful , and I am strong ."
I des@@ er@@ ve the education that I get here .
"&quot; + 2 &quot; said , &quot; I ain &apos;t all bad . &quot;"
Can we st@@ and to have more relation@@ shi@@ ps ?
N@@ ever .
It &apos;s the connec@@ tion . It &apos;s the relation@@ shi@@ ps .
"We te@@ ach any@@ way , because that &apos;s what we do ."
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ing and learning should bring jo@@ y .
We &apos;re born to make a difference .
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t it feel good to say it out l@@ ou@@ d ?
"I want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the ro@@ le of social mov@@ ements in cre@@ ating change in M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ ma@@ jor@@ ity societies ."
"So let me be@@ g@@ in by first of all giving a very , very bri@@ ef history of time , if I may ind@@ ul@@ ge ."
In medi@@ ev@@ al societies there were defin@@ ed al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces .
A@@ n id@@ ent@@ ity was defin@@ ed pri@@ mar@@ ily by relig@@ ion .
"In the age of globaliz@@ ation , we mov@@ ed on ."
"But I believe now that we &apos;re mov@@ ing into a new age , and that age The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es d@@ ub@@ b@@ ed rec@@ ently as &quot; &quot; the age of behav@@ ior . &quot; &quot; How I defin@@ e the age of behav@@ ior is a peri@@ od of trans@@ national al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces , where id@@ ent@@ ity is defin@@ ed more so by ideas and nar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves ."
"But actually it &apos;s my beli@@ ef that the people who &apos;ve been truly cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ing on this age of behav@@ ior , up until now , up until rec@@ ent times , up until the last six months , the people who have been cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ing most on the age of behav@@ ior and the trans@@ national al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces , using di@@ g@@ ital acti@@ vis@@ m and other sor@@ ts of b@@ ord@@ er@@ less techn@@ olog@@ ies , those who &apos;ve been ben@@ ef@@ iting from this have been extre@@ mis@@ ts ."
And that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on .
"Now I should know , because for 1@@ 3 years of my life , I was inv@@ ol@@ ved in an extre@@ me I@@ sl@@ am@@ ist organiz@@ ation ."
"And my story , my per@@ s@@ onal story , is truly evidence for the age of behav@@ ior that I &apos;m att@@ emp@@ ting to el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate up@@ on here ."
"I was , by the way — I &apos;m an E@@ s@@ sex lad , born and ra@@ ised in E@@ s@@ sex in the U.@@ K@@ ."
"A@@ t the age of 1@@ 7 , I was rec@@ ru@@ iting people from C@@ am@@ br@@ id@@ ge Un@@ iver@@ s@@ ity to this organiz@@ ation ."
"Now that jour@@ ney , and what took me from E@@ s@@ sex all the way across the world — by the way , we were l@@ au@@ gh@@ ing at democra@@ tic acti@@ vis@@ ts ."
We f@@ el@@ t they were from the age of y@@ es@@ ter@@ year .
I learned how to use e@@ ma@@ il from the extre@@ mis@@ t organiz@@ ation that I used .
"E@@ v@@ ent@@ ually I was det@@ ec@@ ted , of course , in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t ."
But the way in which I learned to use technology to my adv@@ ant@@ age was because I was within an extre@@ mis@@ t organiz@@ ation that was for@@ ced to think be@@ y@@ ond the con@@ fin@@ es of the na@@ tion@@ -@@ state .
"So as I said , we looked to the stat@@ us qu@@ o and r@@ id@@ ic@@ ul@@ ed it ."
And it &apos;s not just I@@ sl@@ am@@ ist extre@@ mis@@ ts that did this .
A form of an@@ ti@@ -@@ I@@ sl@@ am r@@ h@@ et@@ or@@ ic is also on the r@@ ise and it &apos;s trans@@ national .
And the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences that this is having is that it &apos;s af@@ fec@@ ting the political cli@@ mate across Eu@@ rop@@ e .
Because the Inter@@ net and connec@@ tion techn@@ olog@@ ies are connec@@ ting them across the world .
"In certain countries , mo@@ squ@@ e min@@ ar@@ ets are being ban@@ ned ."
"In others , ko@@ sh@@ er and hal@@ al me@@ at are being ban@@ ned , as we speak ."
"And on the fli@@ p side , we have trans@@ national I@@ sl@@ am@@ ist extre@@ mis@@ ts doing the same thing across their own societies ."
And so they are po@@ c@@ ket@@ s of par@@ o@@ ch@@ i@@ al@@ ism that are being connec@@ ted in a way that makes them feel like they are main@@ stre@@ am .
Now that never would have been possible before .
"They would have f@@ el@@ t is@@ ol@@ ated , until these sor@@ ts of techn@@ olog@@ ies came around and connec@@ ted them in a way that made them feel part of a larg@@ er ph@@ enom@@ en@@ on ."
Well I believe they &apos;re getting left far be@@ h@@ ind .
And I &apos;ll give you an example here at this st@@ age .
I@@ f any of you remem@@ b@@ ers the Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ mas D@@ ay bom@@ b pl@@ ot : there &apos;s a man called A@@ n@@ war al-@@ A@@ w@@ l@@ ak@@ i .
"As an American c@@ it@@ iz@@ en , e@@ th@@ n@@ ically a Y@@ em@@ eni , in h@@ id@@ ing cur@@ r@@ ently in Y@@ em@@ en , who in@@ sp@@ i@@ red a N@@ ig@@ er@@ ian , son of the head of N@@ ig@@ eria &apos;s national b@@ ank ."
"This N@@ ig@@ er@@ ian stud@@ ent studi@@ ed in L@@ on@@ don , tra@@ ined in Y@@ em@@ en , bo@@ ar@@ ded a f@@ light in A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ da@@ m to att@@ ack America ."
"The O@@ ld m@@ ent@@ ality with a cap@@ ital O , as re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ed by the na@@ tion@@ -@@ state , not yet fully into the age of behav@@ ior , not recogni@@ zing the power of trans@@ national social mov@@ ements , got left be@@ h@@ ind ."
And the Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ mas D@@ ay bomb@@ er almost suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed in att@@ ac@@ king the United States of America .
"A@@ ga@@ in with the example of the far right : that we find , i@@ ron@@ ically , x@@ en@@ o@@ ph@@ ob@@ ic na@@ tion@@ al@@ ists are ut@@ il@@ iz@@ ing the ben@@ ef@@ its of globaliz@@ ation ."
So why are they suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing ?
And why are democra@@ cy as@@ pir@@ an@@ ts f@@ all@@ ing be@@ h@@ ind ?
Well we need to understand the power of the social mov@@ ements who understand this .
"And a social movement is comp@@ ris@@ ed , in my view , it &apos;s comp@@ ris@@ ed of four ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics ."
It &apos;s comp@@ ris@@ ed of ideas and nar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves and sym@@ bol@@ s and lead@@ ers .
"I &apos;ll talk you through one example , and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be a@@ w@@ are of , and that &apos;s the example of Al@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ eda ."
"If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ eda , that &apos;s something that comes to your mind im@@ medi@@ ately ."
"In@@ c@@ id@@ ent@@ ally , the difference between ideas and nar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves : the idea is the cause that one beli@@ ev@@ es in ; and the nar@@ ra@@ tive is the way to s@@ ell that cause — the pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da , if you like , of the cause ."
So the ideas and the nar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves of Al@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ eda come to your mind im@@ medi@@ ately .
One of their lead@@ ers was kil@@ led in P@@ ak@@ istan rec@@ ently .
And that &apos;s the power of social mov@@ ements .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , if I ask your min@@ ds to f@@ oc@@ us cur@@ r@@ ently on P@@ ak@@ istan , and I ask you to think of the sym@@ bol@@ s and the lead@@ ers for democra@@ cy in P@@ ak@@ istan today , you &apos;ll be hard pres@@ sed to think be@@ y@@ ond perhaps the as@@ sas@@ sin@@ ation of B@@ en@@ az@@ ir B@@ h@@ ut@@ to ."
"Wh@@ ich means , by defin@@ ition , that particular lead@@ er no longer ex@@ ists ."
"One of the problems we &apos;re fac@@ ing is , in my view , that there are no globaliz@@ ed , y@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ led , gra@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ots social mov@@ ements adv@@ oc@@ ating for democra@@ tic culture across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ ma@@ jor@@ ity societies ."
"There is no equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent of the Al@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ eda , without the ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m , for democra@@ cy across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ ma@@ jor@@ ity societies ."
So that be@@ gs the next question .
And I believe that &apos;s for four reas@@ ons .
"I believe , number one , it &apos;s compl@@ ac@@ en@@ cy ."
And that level of compl@@ ac@@ en@@ cy means they don &apos;t feel the need to adv@@ oc@@ ate for that culture .
"The second , I believe , is political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness ."
That we have a h@@ es@@ itation in es@@ p@@ ous@@ ing the universal@@ ity of democra@@ tic culture because we are as@@ soci@@ ating that — we as@@ soci@@ ate beli@@ ev@@ ing in the universal@@ ity of our val@@ ues — with extre@@ mis@@ ts .
"@@ Y@@ et actually , wh@@ en@@ ever we talk about human ri@@ ghts , we do say that human ri@@ ghts are univer@@ sa@@ l ."
But actually going out to pro@@ pa@@ ga@@ te that view is as@@ soci@@ ated with e@@ i@@ ther ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ ati@@ vis@@ m or with I@@ sl@@ am@@ ist extre@@ mis@@ m .
T@@ o go around saying that I believe democra@@ tic culture is the best that we &apos;ve ar@@ r@@ iv@@ ed at as a form of political organiz@@ ing is as@@ soci@@ ated with extre@@ mis@@ m .
"And then you have a th@@ ir@@ d par@@ ty saying , &quot; V@@ ot@@ e for us ; we &apos;ll est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish a the@@ oc@@ ra@@ cy . &quot;"
"And what happens as a res@@ ult of this is , when those par@@ ties are elec@@ ted , and in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably they fa@@ il , or in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably they make political mis@@ takes , democra@@ cy takes the bl@@ ame for their political mis@@ takes ."
"And then people say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve tried democra@@ cy . It doesn &apos;t really work ."
"When talking about those reas@@ ons , let &apos;s bre@@ ak down certain pre@@ con@@ cep@@ tions ."
"A@@ nec@@ d@@ ot@@ ally , we can demon@@ stra@@ te that if pov@@ erty was the only fac@@ tor , well B@@ in L@@ ad@@ en is from one of the ri@@ ch@@ est famil@@ ies in S@@ au@@ di A@@ ra@@ b@@ ia ."
"H@@ is dep@@ ut@@ y , A@@ y@@ man al-@@ Z@@ a@@ wa@@ h@@ ir@@ i , was a pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric@@ ian — not an ill@@ -@@ educ@@ ated man ."
"And what I believe is mis@@ sing is gen@@ u@@ ine gra@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ots acti@@ vis@@ m on the ground , in ad@@ d@@ ition to inter@@ national a@@ id , in ad@@ d@@ ition to education , in ad@@ d@@ ition to health ."
"@@ Not ex@@ cl@@ us@@ ive to these things , but in ad@@ d@@ ition to them , is pro@@ pa@@ ga@@ ting a gen@@ u@@ ine de@@ m@@ and for democra@@ cy on the ground ."
And this is where I believe ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ at@@ ism had it up@@ s@@ ide@@ -@@ down .
Ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ at@@ ism had the ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ y that you go in with a sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ led approach to im@@ pose democra@@ tic val@@ ues from the top down .
"Wh@@ ere@@ as I@@ sl@@ am@@ ists and far@@ -@@ right organiz@@ ations , for dec@@ ad@@ es , have been buil@@ ding de@@ m@@ and for their ide@@ ology on the gra@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ots ."
"M@@ as@@ s mov@@ ements in P@@ ak@@ istan have been re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ed after the A@@ ra@@ b up@@ ris@@ ings main@@ ly by organiz@@ ations cl@@ a@@ im@@ ing for some form of the@@ oc@@ ra@@ cy , rather than for a democra@@ tic up@@ ris@@ ing ."
"Because since pre@@ -@@ par@@ t@@ ition , they &apos;ve been buil@@ ding de@@ m@@ and for their ide@@ ology on the ground ."
And what &apos;s needed is a gen@@ u@@ ine trans@@ national y@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ led movement that works to acti@@ vely adv@@ oc@@ ate for the democra@@ tic culture — which is nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily more than just elec@@ tions .
"What that will do is av@@ o@@ id the problem I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er , where cur@@ r@@ ently we have political par@@ ties pres@@ ent@@ ing democra@@ cy as mer@@ ely a political cho@@ ice in those societies al@@ on@@ g@@ side other cho@@ ices such as mil@@ it@@ ary rul@@ e and the@@ oc@@ ra@@ cy ."
"What we &apos;ll have in the end is this ide@@ al that you see on the sl@@ ide here — the ide@@ al that people should v@@ ot@@ e in an ex@@ is@@ ting democra@@ cy , not for a democra@@ cy ."
"Now to con@@ cl@@ u@@ de , how does that happen ?"
"Well , E@@ g@@ yp@@ t is a good star@@ ting point ."
The A@@ ra@@ b up@@ ris@@ ings have demon@@ stra@@ ted that this is already beginning .
But what happened in the A@@ ra@@ b up@@ ris@@ ings and what happened in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t was particul@@ arly c@@ a@@ th@@ ar@@ tic for me .
We need to move one ste@@ p be@@ y@@ ond that now .
Because it &apos;s not enough to re@@ move a lead@@ er or rul@@ er or dic@@ t@@ at@@ or .
"And we &apos;ve made a start for that in P@@ ak@@ istan with a movement called K@@ hu@@ di , where we are working on the ground to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the y@@ ou@@ th to create gen@@ u@@ ine bu@@ y-@@ in for the democra@@ tic culture ."
And it &apos;s with that thought that I &apos;ll end .
"And my time is up , and th@@ ank you for your time ."
"B@@ ack in New Y@@ or@@ k , I am the head of develop@@ ment for a n@@ on@@ -@@ prof@@ it called R@@ ob@@ in H@@ ood ."
"When I &apos;m not f@@ igh@@ ting pov@@ erty , I &apos;m f@@ igh@@ ting fir@@ es as the as@@ s@@ ist@@ ant cap@@ tain of a vol@@ un@@ te@@ er fire comp@@ any ."
"Now in our to@@ wn , where the vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers sup@@ pl@@ ement a high@@ ly sk@@ il@@ led c@@ are@@ er st@@ af@@ f , you have to get to the fire scen@@ e pretty early to get in on any action ."
I remem@@ ber my first fire .
"I was the second vol@@ un@@ te@@ er on the scen@@ e , so there was a pretty good chan@@ ce I was going to get in ."
But still it was a real fo@@ ot@@ ra@@ ce against the other vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in ch@@ arg@@ e to find out what our as@@ sign@@ ments would be .
"When I found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very en@@ gag@@ ing con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner , who was sur@@ ely having one of the wor@@ st days of her life ."
"@@ Here it was , the middle of the ni@@ ght , she was st@@ anding outside in the p@@ our@@ ing ra@@ in , under an um@@ br@@ el@@ la , in her pa@@ j@@ amas , b@@ are@@ fo@@ ot , while her h@@ ou@@ se was in fl@@ am@@ es ."
The other vol@@ un@@ te@@ er who had ar@@ r@@ iv@@ ed just before me — let &apos;s call him Le@@ x L@@ u@@ ther — ( Laughter ) got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and sa@@ ve the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner &apos;s do@@ g .
The do@@ g ! I was st@@ un@@ ned with j@@ e@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
"@@ Here was some la@@ w@@ y@@ er or money man@@ ag@@ er who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a b@@ urn@@ ing buil@@ ding to sa@@ ve a liv@@ ing cre@@ ature , just because he be@@ at me by five secon@@ ds ."
"Well , I was next ."
The cap@@ tain w@@ av@@ ed me over .
"He said , &quot; &quot; B@@ ez@@ os , I need you to go into the h@@ ou@@ se ."
"I need you to go up@@ stair@@ s , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I swe@@ ar ."
"So , not exactly what I was hop@@ ing for , but off I went — up the stair@@ s , down the h@@ all , past the &apos; real &apos; fi@@ re@@ f@@ igh@@ ters , who were pretty much done p@@ ut@@ ting out the fire at this point , into the ma@@ st@@ er bed@@ room to get a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es ."
"Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no h@@ ero ."
( Laughter ) I car@@ ri@@ ed my pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad back do@@ w@@ n@@ stair@@ s where I met my n@@ em@@ esis and the pre@@ ci@@ ous do@@ g by the fron@@ t do@@ or .
"We took our tre@@ as@@ ures outside to the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner , where , not sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly , his re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed much more att@@ en@@ tion than did min@@ e ."
"A few weeks later , the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed a l@@ et@@ ter from the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner th@@ an@@ king us for the val@@ i@@ ant ef@@ for@@ t dis@@ play@@ ed in sav@@ ing her home ."
The act of kin@@ d@@ ness she not@@ ed ab@@ ove all others : someone had even g@@ ot@@ ten her a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es .
"( Laughter ) In both my v@@ oc@@ ation at R@@ ob@@ in H@@ ood and my av@@ oc@@ ation as a vol@@ un@@ te@@ er fi@@ re@@ f@@ igh@@ ter , I am wit@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gener@@ os@@ ity and kin@@ d@@ ness on a mon@@ um@@ ental sc@@ ale , but I &apos;m also wit@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gra@@ ce and cou@@ ra@@ ge on an individ@@ ual bas@@ is ."
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
They all matter .
"So as I look around this room at people who e@@ i@@ ther have achi@@ ev@@ ed , or are on their way to achi@@ ev@@ ing , re@@ mark@@ able lev@@ els of success , I would of@@ fer this re@@ min@@ der : don &apos;t wa@@ it ."
D@@ on &apos;t wa@@ it until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
"If you have something to give , give it now ."
S@@ er@@ ve f@@ ood at a s@@ ou@@ p k@@ it@@ ch@@ en . C@@ le@@ an up a ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood par@@ k .
B@@ e a m@@ ent@@ or .
"@@ Not every day is going to of@@ fer us a chan@@ ce to sa@@ ve somebody &apos;s life , but every day of@@ fer@@ s us an op@@ por@@ tun@@ ity to af@@ fect one ."
So get in the game . S@@ ave the sho@@ es .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) B@@ run@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ s@@ ani : Mar@@ k , Mar@@ k , come back . ( Applause )"
Mar@@ k B@@ ez@@ os : Thank you .
"M@@ ar@@ k Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ ber@@ g , a jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist was asking him a question about the news fe@@ ed ."
"And the jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist was asking him , &quot; Why is this so important ? &quot;"
"And Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ ber@@ g said , &quot; &quot; A squ@@ ir@@ re@@ l d@@ ying in your fron@@ t yar@@ d may be more rel@@ ev@@ ant to your interes@@ ts right now than people d@@ ying in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a . &quot; &quot; And I want to talk about what a W@@ eb based on that idea of rel@@ ev@@ ance might look like ."
"So when I was gro@@ wing up in a really r@@ ural are@@ a in M@@ a@@ ine , the Inter@@ net me@@ ant something very different to me ."
It me@@ ant a connec@@ tion to the world .
It me@@ ant something that would con@@ n@@ ect us all together .
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democra@@ cy and for our society .
"And if we don &apos;t pa@@ y att@@ en@@ tion to it , it could be a real problem ."
So I first not@@ ic@@ ed this in a place I sp@@ end a lot of time — my F@@ ac@@ eb@@ ook p@@ age .
"I &apos;m progres@@ sive , polit@@ ically — big sur@@ pr@@ ise — but I &apos;ve always g@@ one out of my way to me@@ et con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves ."
I like he@@ ar@@ ing what they &apos;re thinking about ; I like see@@ ing what they l@@ ink to ; I like learning a thing or two .
And so I was sur@@ pris@@ ed when I not@@ ic@@ ed one day that the con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves had di@@ sa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed from my F@@ ac@@ eb@@ ook fe@@ ed .
"And what it turned out was going on was that F@@ ac@@ eb@@ ook was looking at which l@@ in@@ ks I cl@@ ic@@ ked on , and it was not@@ ic@@ ing that , actually , I was cl@@ ic@@ king more on my liber@@ al friends &apos; l@@ in@@ ks than on my con@@ serv@@ ative friends &apos; l@@ in@@ ks ."
"And without con@@ sul@@ ting me about it , it had ed@@ ited them out ."
They di@@ sa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed .
"So F@@ ac@@ eb@@ ook isn &apos;t the only place that &apos;s doing this kind of inv@@ is@@ ible , alg@@ ori@@ th@@ mic ed@@ iting of the W@@ eb ."
Go@@ og@@ le &apos;s doing it too .
"If I se@@ arch for something , and you se@@ arch for something , even right now at the very same time , we may get very different se@@ arch results ."
Th@@ ink about it for a second : there is no stan@@ dar@@ d Go@@ og@@ le any@@ more .
"And you know , the fun@@ ny thing about this is that it &apos;s hard to see ."
You can &apos;t see how different your se@@ arch results are from any@@ one else &apos;s .
So here &apos;s my fri@@ end S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s scre@@ en sh@@ ot .
And here &apos;s my fri@@ end D@@ an@@ i@@ el &apos;s scre@@ en sh@@ ot .
"When you put them s@@ ide@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ side , you don &apos;t even have to read the l@@ in@@ ks to see how different these two p@@ ages are ."
"But when you do read the l@@ in@@ ks , it &apos;s really quite re@@ mark@@ able ."
D@@ an@@ i@@ el didn &apos;t get anything about the pro@@ t@@ es@@ ts in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t at all in his first p@@ age of Go@@ og@@ le results .
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s results were ful@@ l of them .
And this was the big story of the day at that time .
That &apos;s how different these results are becom@@ ing .
So it &apos;s not just Go@@ og@@ le and F@@ ac@@ eb@@ ook e@@ i@@ ther .
This is something that &apos;s s@@ wee@@ ping the W@@ eb .
There are a whole h@@ ost of comp@@ an@@ ies that are doing this kind of person@@ aliz@@ ation .
"@@ Y@@ a@@ h@@ o@@ o Ne@@ ws , the big@@ gest news s@@ ite on the Inter@@ net , is now person@@ aliz@@ ed — different people get different things ."
"H@@ uf@@ f@@ ing@@ ton P@@ ost , the W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton P@@ ost , the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es — all fli@@ r@@ ting with person@@ aliz@@ ation in vari@@ ous ways ."
"And this mov@@ es us very quickly to@@ ward a world in which the Inter@@ net is sho@@ wing us what it thin@@ ks we want to see , but not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily what we need to see ."
"And I think , if you take all of these fil@@ ters together , you take all these alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms , you get what I call a fil@@ ter bub@@ ble ."
"And your fil@@ ter bub@@ ble is your own per@@ s@@ onal , uni@@ qu@@ e universe of information that you live in on@@ line ."
"And what &apos;s in your fil@@ ter bub@@ ble dep@@ ends on who you are , and it dep@@ ends on what you do ."
But the thing is that you don &apos;t dec@@ ide what gets in .
"And more impor@@ tan@@ tly , you don &apos;t actually see what gets ed@@ ited out ."
So one of the problems with the fil@@ ter bub@@ ble was disc@@ over@@ ed by some rese@@ arch@@ ers at N@@ et@@ fli@@ x .
"They en@@ ter the qu@@ e@@ ue , they just z@@ i@@ p right out ."
"So &quot; &quot; I@@ ro@@ n M@@ an &quot; &quot; z@@ i@@ ps right out , and &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ iting for Su@@ per@@ man &quot; &quot; can wa@@ it for a really long time ."
What they disc@@ over@@ ed was that in our N@@ et@@ fli@@ x qu@@ e@@ ues there &apos;s this e@@ p@@ ic str@@ ug@@ g@@ le going on between our future as@@ pira@@ tional selves and our more im@@ pul@@ sive pres@@ ent selves .
"You know we all want to be someone who has wat@@ ched &quot; &quot; R@@ ash@@ o@@ mon , &quot; &quot; but right now we want to watch &quot; &quot; A@@ ce V@@ ent@@ ura &quot; &quot; for the f@@ our@@ th time ."
It giv@@ es us a little bit of J@@ us@@ tin Bi@@ eb@@ er and a little bit of A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan .
It giv@@ es us some information ve@@ g@@ et@@ ab@@ les ; it giv@@ es us some information des@@ s@@ ert .
"And the challenge with these kinds of alg@@ ori@@ th@@ mic fil@@ ters , these person@@ aliz@@ ed fil@@ ters , is that , because they &apos;re main@@ ly looking at what you cl@@ ic@@ k on first , it can th@@ row off that bal@@ ance ."
"And instead of a bal@@ an@@ ced information di@@ et , you can end up sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed by information j@@ un@@ k f@@ ood ."
But that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
What we &apos;re see@@ ing is more of a pas@@ sing of the t@@ or@@ ch from human ga@@ te@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s to alg@@ ori@@ th@@ mic ones .
And the thing is that the alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms don &apos;t yet have the kind of em@@ bed@@ ded e@@ th@@ ics that the ed@@ it@@ ors did .
"So if alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms are going to c@@ ura@@ te the world for us , if they &apos;re going to dec@@ ide what we get to see and what we don &apos;t get to see , then we need to make sure that they &apos;re not just k@@ ey@@ ed to rel@@ ev@@ ance ."
We need to make sure that they also show us things that are un@@ com@@ for@@ table or challen@@ ging or important — this is what TE@@ D does — other poin@@ ts of view .
"And the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society ."
"In 19@@ 15 , it &apos;s not like new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers were swe@@ ating a lot about their c@@ iv@@ ic responsi@@ bil@@ ities ."
Th@@ en people not@@ ic@@ ed that they were doing something really important .
"That , in fact , you c@@ ouldn &apos;t have a fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing democra@@ cy if c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens didn &apos;t get a good flow of information , that the new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers were c@@ rit@@ ical because they were ac@@ ting as the fil@@ ter , and then jour@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic e@@ th@@ ics developed ."
"It wasn &apos;t per@@ fect , but it got us through the last century ."
"And so now , we &apos;re kind of back in 19@@ 15 on the W@@ eb ."
And we need the new ga@@ te@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s to en@@ cod@@ e that kind of responsi@@ bil@@ ity into the cod@@ e that they &apos;re writ@@ ing .
"I know that there are a lot of people here from F@@ ac@@ eb@@ ook and from Go@@ og@@ le — L@@ ar@@ ry and S@@ er@@ g@@ ey — people who have hel@@ ped build the W@@ eb as it is , and I &apos;m gra@@ te@@ ful for that ."
"But we really need you to make sure that these alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have en@@ cod@@ ed in them a sense of the publi@@ c life , a sense of c@@ iv@@ ic responsi@@ bil@@ ity ."
We need you to make sure that they &apos;re tr@@ an@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent enough that we can see what the rul@@ es are that de@@ ter@@ min@@ e what gets through our fil@@ ters .
And we need you to give us some contro@@ l so that we can dec@@ ide what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
Because I think we really need the Inter@@ net to be that thing that we all dre@@ amed of it being .
We need it to con@@ n@@ ect us all together .
We need it to int@@ ro@@ duc@@ e us to new ideas and new people and different per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ves .
And it &apos;s not going to do that if it le@@ av@@ es us all is@@ ol@@ ated in a W@@ eb of one .
Thank you .

"What you &apos;re doing , right now , at this very moment , is kil@@ l@@ ing you ."
"M@@ ore than c@@ ars or the Inter@@ net or even that little mobil@@ e dev@@ ice we keep talking about , the technology you &apos;re using the most almost every day is this , your t@@ ush ."
"@@ N@@ ow@@ ada@@ ys people are sit@@ ting 9@@ .@@ 3 h@@ ours a day , which is more than we &apos;re s@@ le@@ e@@ ping , at 7@@ .@@ 7 h@@ ours ."
"S@@ it@@ ting is so incredi@@ bly pre@@ val@@ ent , we don &apos;t even question how much we &apos;re doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it doesn &apos;t even occ@@ ur to us that it &apos;s not ok@@ ay ."
"In that way , sit@@ ting has become the s@@ mo@@ king of our gener@@ ation ."
"O@@ f course there &apos;s health con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences to this , sc@@ ary ones , b@@ es@@ id@@ es the wa@@ ist ."
"Th@@ ings like b@@ reas@@ t can@@ cer and col@@ on can@@ cer are direc@@ tly ti@@ ed to our l@@ ack of physical &#91; acti@@ vity &#93; , T@@ en percent in fact , on both of those ."
"S@@ i@@ x percent for heart disease , seven percent for typ@@ e 2 diab@@ et@@ es , which is what my father di@@ ed of ."
"Now , any of those stat@@ s should con@@ vin@@ ce each of us to get off our d@@ uff more , but if you &apos;re anything like me , it won &apos;t ."
What did get me mov@@ ing was a social inter@@ action .
"S@@ ome@@ one inv@@ ited me to a me@@ et@@ ing , but c@@ ouldn &apos;t man@@ age to f@@ it me in to a re@@ gul@@ ar sort of con@@ fer@@ ence room me@@ et@@ ing , and said , &quot; I have to wal@@ k my do@@ gs to@@ mor@@ row . C@@ ould you come then ? &quot;"
"It se@@ em@@ ed kind of od@@ d to do , and actually , that first me@@ et@@ ing , I remem@@ ber thinking , &quot; I have to be the one to ask the next question , &quot; because I knew I was going to h@@ uff and p@@ uff d@@ uring this con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"And yet , I &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own ."
"So instead of going to co@@ f@@ fe@@ e me@@ et@@ ings or flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent@@ -@@ l@@ it con@@ fer@@ ence room me@@ et@@ ings , I ask people to go on a walking me@@ et@@ ing , to the tun@@ e of 20 to 30 mil@@ es a wee@@ k ."
It &apos;s changed my life .
"But before that , what actually happened was , I used to think about it as , you could take care of your health , or you could take care of ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tions , and one always came at the cost of the other ."
"So now , s@@ ever@@ al hundred of these walking me@@ et@@ ings later , I &apos;ve learned a few things ."
"F@@ irst , there &apos;s this ama@@ zing thing about actually getting out of the bo@@ x that lead@@ s to ou@@ t@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ x thinking ."
"Wh@@ ether it &apos;s nature or the ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise itself , it cert@@ ain@@ ly works ."
"And second , and probably the more re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in op@@ position when they &apos;re really not that way ."
"And if we &apos;re going to sol@@ ve problems and look at the world really differ@@ ently , whether it &apos;s in govern@@ ance or b@@ usiness or environ@@ mental issu@@ es , job cre@@ ation , maybe we can think about how to re@@ fra@@ me those problems as having both things be true ."
Because it was when that happened with this wal@@ k@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ talk idea that things bec@@ ame do@@ able and su@@ st@@ ain@@ able and vi@@ able .
"So I started this talk talking about the t@@ ush , so I &apos;ll end with the bot@@ tom line , which is , wal@@ k and talk ."
W@@ al@@ k the talk .
"You &apos;ll be sur@@ pris@@ ed at how f@@ res@@ h air driv@@ es f@@ res@@ h thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an enti@@ r@@ ely new set of ideas ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;d like to take you to another world .
"And I &apos;d like to share a 45 ye@@ ar-@@ old love story with the poor , liv@@ ing on less than one doll@@ ar a day ."
"I went to a very el@@ it@@ ist , s@@ nob@@ b@@ ish , exp@@ en@@ sive education in India , and that almost des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed me ."
"I was all set to be a di@@ pl@@ o@@ mat , teacher , doc@@ tor — all la@@ id out ."
"Th@@ en , I don &apos;t look it , but I was the In@@ dian national squ@@ as@@ h ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on for three years ."
( Laughter ) The whole world was la@@ id out for me .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing was at my fe@@ et .
I could do nothing wrong .
And then I thought out of cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity I &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
"So in 19@@ 6@@ 5 , I went to what was called the wor@@ st Bi@@ h@@ ar fam@@ ine in India , and I saw star@@ v@@ ation , de@@ ath , people d@@ ying of h@@ un@@ ger , for the first time ."
It changed my life .
"I came back home , told my mother , &quot; I &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;"
M@@ other went into a com@@ a .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What is this ?
"The whole world is la@@ id out for you , the best j@@ obs are la@@ id out for you , and you want to go and work in a village ?"
"I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve got the best educ@@ tion ."
It made me think .
And I wanted to give something back in my own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
"@@ No job , no money , no sec@@ ur@@ ity , no pro@@ sp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to live and di@@ g w@@ ells for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ i@@ g w@@ ells for five years ?"
"You went to the most exp@@ en@@ sive school and college in India , and you want to di@@ g w@@ ells for five years ? &quot; &quot; She didn &apos;t speak to me for a very long time , because she thought I &apos;d let my family down ."
"But then , I was ex@@ posed to the most ex@@ tra@@ ordinary kno@@ w@@ l@@ edge and sk@@ il@@ ls that very poor people have , which are never b@@ rou@@ ght into the main@@ stre@@ am — which is never id@@ enti@@ fied , re@@ spec@@ ted , app@@ li@@ ed on a large sc@@ ale ."
And I thought I &apos;d start a B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge — college only for the poor .
What the poor thought was important would be re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ted in the college .
I went to this village for the first time .
"E@@ l@@ d@@ ers came to me and said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you run@@ ning from the pol@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You fail@@ ed in your ex@@ am ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot;"
"&quot; You didn &apos;t get a govern@@ ment job ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
The education system in India makes you look at P@@ aris and New D@@ el@@ h@@ i and Z@@ ur@@ ich ; what are you doing in this village ?
"I@@ s there something wrong with you you &apos;re not telling us ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to actually start a college only for the poor ."
What the poor thought was important would be re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ted in the college . &quot; &quot; So the el@@ d@@ ers gave me some very sound and pro@@ found ad@@ vic@@ e .
"They said , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase , don &apos;t bring any@@ one with a de@@ g@@ ree and qu@@ ali@@ fic@@ ation into your college . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s the only college in India where , if you should have a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . or a M@@ as@@ ter &apos;s , you are dis@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied to come ."
You have to be a cop@@ -@@ out or a wa@@ sh@@ -@@ out or a dro@@ p@@ out to come to our college .
You have to work with your h@@ ands .
You have to have a di@@ gn@@ ity of lab@@ or .
You have to show that you have a sk@@ ill that you can of@@ fer to the commun@@ ity and pro@@ v@@ ide a ser@@ vic@@ e to the commun@@ ity .
"So we started the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , and we re@@ defin@@ ed profes@@ sion@@ al@@ ism ."
Wh@@ o is a profes@@ si@@ onal ?
"A profes@@ si@@ onal is someone who has a com@@ b@@ in@@ ation of comp@@ et@@ ence , con@@ f@@ idence and beli@@ ef ."
A water div@@ in@@ er is a profes@@ si@@ onal .
A trad@@ iti@@ onal mid@@ wife is a profes@@ si@@ onal .
A trad@@ iti@@ onal b@@ one s@@ et@@ ter is a profes@@ si@@ onal .
These are profes@@ sion@@ als all over the world .
You find them in any in@@ acc@@ es@@ si@@ ble village around the world .
And we thought that these people should come into the main@@ stre@@ am and show that the kno@@ w@@ l@@ edge and sk@@ il@@ ls that they have is univer@@ sa@@ l .
"It need@@ s to be used , need@@ s to be app@@ li@@ ed , need@@ s to be sho@@ wn to the world outside — that these kno@@ w@@ l@@ edge and sk@@ il@@ ls are rel@@ ev@@ ant even today ."
So the college works follo@@ wing the lif@@ est@@ y@@ le and work@@ st@@ y@@ le of M@@ a@@ h@@ at@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i .
"You e@@ at on the flo@@ or , you s@@ le@@ ep on the flo@@ or , you work on the flo@@ or ."
"There are no con@@ trac@@ ts , no writ@@ ten con@@ trac@@ ts ."
"You can st@@ ay with me for 20 years , go to@@ mor@@ row ."
And no one can get more than $ 100 a mon@@ th .
"You come for the money , you don &apos;t come to B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"You come for the work and the challenge , you &apos;ll come to the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
That is where we want you to try cra@@ z@@ y ideas .
"Wh@@ at@@ ever idea you have , come and try it ."
It doesn &apos;t matter if you fa@@ il .
"B@@ at@@ tered , br@@ u@@ ised , you start again ."
It &apos;s the only college where the teacher is the lear@@ ner and the lear@@ ner is the teacher .
And it &apos;s the only college where we don &apos;t give a c@@ erti@@ fic@@ ate .
You are c@@ erti@@ fied by the commun@@ ity you ser@@ ve .
You don &apos;t need a p@@ ap@@ er to h@@ ang on the w@@ all to show that you are an engine@@ er .
"So when I said that , they said , &quot; &quot; Well show us what is possible . What are you doing ?"
This is all m@@ um@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ umb@@ o if you can &apos;t show it on the ground . &quot; &quot; So we built the first B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in 198@@ 6 .
"It was built by 12 B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts who can &apos;t read and w@@ r@@ ite , built on $ 1@@ .@@ 50 a s@@ q@@ . ft ."
"@@ 150 people liv@@ ed there , worked there ."
They got the A@@ g@@ a K@@ h@@ an A@@ ward for A@@ rch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture in 200@@ 2 .
"But then they sus@@ p@@ ec@@ ted , they thought there was an arch@@ it@@ ect be@@ h@@ ind it ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , they made the bl@@ u@@ e@@ prin@@ ts , but the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts actually con@@ struc@@ ted the college . &quot; &quot; We are the only ones who actually re@@ turned the a@@ ward for $ 5@@ 0,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually c@@ as@@ ting as@@ per@@ sions on the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts of T@@ il@@ on@@ ia ."
"I asked a for@@ es@@ ter — high@@ -@@ po@@ wer@@ ed , p@@ ap@@ er@@ -@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied exper@@ t — I said , &quot; &quot; What can you build in this place ? &quot; &quot; He had one look at the so@@ il and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ get it . No way ."
Not even wor@@ th it .
"@@ No water , ro@@ c@@ k@@ y so@@ il . &quot; &quot; I was in a bit of a sp@@ ot ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , I &apos;ll go to the old man in village and say , &apos; What should I grow in this sp@@ ot ? &apos; &quot; &quot; He looked qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly at me and said , &quot; You build this , you build this , you put this , and it &apos;ll work . &quot;"
This is what it looks like today .
"W@@ ent to the ro@@ of , and all the women said , &quot; &quot; C@@ lear out ."
The men should c@@ lear out because we don &apos;t want to share this technology with the men .
"This is wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of@@ ing the ro@@ of . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It is a bit of j@@ ag@@ g@@ ery , a bit of ur@@ ens and a bit of other things I don &apos;t know ."
But it actually doesn &apos;t le@@ ak .
"S@@ in@@ ce 198@@ 6 , it h@@ as@@ n &apos;t le@@ ak@@ ed ."
"This technology , the women will not share with the men ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the only college which is fully sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied .
A@@ ll the power comes from the su@@ n .
45 kilo@@ wat@@ ts of pan@@ els on the ro@@ of .
And everything works off the su@@ n for the next 2@@ 5 years .
"So long as the su@@ n shin@@ es , we &apos;ll have no problem with power ."
"But the be@@ a@@ ut@@ y is that is was inst@@ all@@ ed by a pri@@ est , a H@@ ind@@ u pri@@ est , who &apos;s only done eight years of pri@@ mar@@ y scho@@ ol@@ ing — never been to school , never been to college ."
He kno@@ ws more about solar than any@@ one I know any@@ where in the world gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed .
"F@@ ood , if you come to the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , is solar co@@ o@@ ked ."
"But the people who f@@ ab@@ ric@@ ated that solar co@@ ok@@ er are women , il@@ liter@@ ate women , who actually f@@ ab@@ ric@@ ate the most so@@ ph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated solar co@@ ok@@ er ."
It &apos;s a par@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic S@@ ch@@ ef@@ fl@@ er solar co@@ ok@@ er .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , they &apos;re almost half G@@ er@@ man , they &apos;re so prec@@ ise ."
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll never find In@@ dian women so prec@@ ise .
"A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely to the last in@@ ch , they can make that co@@ ok@@ er ."
And we have 60 me@@ als tw@@ ice a day of solar co@@ o@@ king .
"We have a den@@ t@@ ist — she &apos;s a grand@@ mother , il@@ liter@@ ate , who &apos;s a den@@ t@@ ist ."
"She actually looks after the te@@ et@@ h of 7@@ ,000 children ."
"B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot technology : this was 198@@ 6 — no engine@@ er , no arch@@ it@@ ect thought of it — but we are col@@ lec@@ ting ra@@ in@@ water from the ro@@ of@@ s ."
V@@ ery little water is was@@ ted .
"A@@ ll the ro@@ of@@ s are connec@@ ted under@@ ground to a 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 lit@@ er tan@@ k , and no water is was@@ ted ."
"If we have four years of dro@@ u@@ ght , we still have water on the cam@@ p@@ us , because we col@@ l@@ ect ra@@ in@@ water ."
"@@ 60 percent of children don &apos;t go to school , because they have to look after an@@ im@@ als — she@@ ep , go@@ at@@ s — domestic ch@@ or@@ es ."
So we thought of star@@ ting a school at ni@@ ght for the children .
"Because the ni@@ ght schools of T@@ il@@ on@@ ia , over 7@@ 5@@ ,000 children have g@@ one through these ni@@ ght schools ."
Because it &apos;s for the con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence of the child ; it &apos;s not for the con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence of the teacher .
And what do we te@@ ach in these schools ?
"D@@ emo@@ cra@@ cy , c@@ it@@ iz@@ en@@ ship , how you should measure your l@@ and , what you should do if you &apos;re ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed , what you should do if your an@@ ima@@ l is sic@@ k ."
This is what we te@@ ach in the ni@@ ght schools .
But all the schools are sol@@ ar-@@ l@@ it .
E@@ very five years we have an elec@@ tion .
"B@@ et@@ ween six to 14 ye@@ ar-@@ old children parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in a democra@@ tic process , and they el@@ ect a pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter ."
The pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter is 12 years old .
"She looks after 20 go@@ at@@ s in the mor@@ ning , but she &apos;s pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter in the ev@@ ening ."
"She has a c@@ ab@@ inet , a min@@ is@@ ter of education , a min@@ is@@ ter for energy , a min@@ is@@ ter for health ."
"And they actually mon@@ it@@ or and super@@ v@@ ise 150 schools for 7@@ ,000 children ."
"She got the World &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s P@@ ri@@ ze five years ago , and she went to Swed@@ en ."
F@@ irst time ever going out of her village .
N@@ ever seen Swed@@ en .
W@@ as@@ n &apos;t da@@ z@@ z@@ led at all by what was happening .
"And the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of Swed@@ en , who &apos;s there , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you ask this child where she got her con@@ f@@ idence from ?"
"She &apos;s only 12 years old , and she &apos;s not da@@ z@@ z@@ led by anything . &quot; &quot; And the girl , who &apos;s on her left , turned to me and looked at the qu@@ e@@ en stra@@ ight in the ey@@ e and said , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase tell her I &apos;m the pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Wh@@ ere the per@@ cent@@ age of il@@ liter@@ ac@@ y is very high , we use p@@ up@@ p@@ et@@ ry ."
P@@ up@@ p@@ ets is the way we commun@@ ic@@ ate .
You have Jo@@ kh@@ im Ch@@ ach@@ a who is 3@@ 00 years old .
He is my psy@@ cho@@ anal@@ y@@ st . He is my teacher .
He &apos;s my doc@@ tor . He &apos;s my la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
He &apos;s my don@@ or .
"He actually ra@@ is@@ es money , sol@@ ves my dis@@ p@@ utes ."
He sol@@ ves my problems in the village .
"If there &apos;s t@@ en@@ sion in the village , if att@@ en@@ dan@@ ce at the schools goes down and there &apos;s a fr@@ ic@@ tion between the teacher and the par@@ ent , the p@@ up@@ p@@ et call@@ s the teacher and the par@@ ent in fron@@ t of the whole village and says , &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ake h@@ ands ."
The att@@ en@@ dan@@ ce must not drop . &quot; &quot; These p@@ up@@ p@@ ets are made out of rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed World B@@ ank re@@ por@@ ts .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this dec@@ en@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed , de@@ my@@ s@@ ti@@ fied approach of sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ f@@ ying vill@@ ages , we &apos;ve c@@ over@@ ed all over India from L@@ ada@@ k@@ h up to B@@ h@@ ut@@ an — all sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied vill@@ ages by people who have been tra@@ ined ."
"And we went to L@@ ada@@ k@@ h , and we asked this woman — this , at min@@ us 40 , you have to come out of the ro@@ of , because there &apos;s no place , it was all s@@ no@@ wed up on both s@@ id@@ es — and we asked this woman , &quot; &quot; What was the ben@@ ef@@ it you had from solar elec@@ tric@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; And she thought for a min@@ ute and said , &quot; It &apos;s the first time I can see my h@@ us@@ b@@ and &apos;s face in w@@ in@@ ter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) W@@ ent to A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan .
One les@@ son we learned in India was men are un@@ tra@@ in@@ able .
"( Laughter ) M@@ en are re@@ st@@ less , men are amb@@ iti@@ ous , men are com@@ pul@@ si@@ vely mobil@@ e , and they all want a c@@ erti@@ fic@@ ate . ( Laughter )"
"A@@ ll across the glob@@ e , you have this t@@ en@@ den@@ cy of men wan@@ ting a c@@ erti@@ fic@@ ate ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because they want to leave the village and go to a c@@ ity , looking for a job ."
So we came up with a great sol@@ ution : tra@@ in grand@@ mothers .
What &apos;s the best way of commun@@ ic@@ ating in the world today ?
Tel@@ ev@@ is@@ ion ? No .
Tel@@ e@@ graph ? No .
Tel@@ e@@ ph@@ one ? No .
T@@ ell a woman .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we went to A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan for the first time , and we pic@@ ked three women and said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; I@@ m@@ possible . They don &apos;t even go out of their ro@@ oms , and you want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make a con@@ c@@ es@@ sion . I &apos;ll take the h@@ us@@ b@@ ands along as well . &quot; &quot; So I took the h@@ us@@ b@@ ands along ."
"O@@ f course , the women were much more intellig@@ ent than the men ."
"In six months , how do we tra@@ in these women ?"
S@@ ign language .
You don &apos;t cho@@ ose the writ@@ ten word .
You don &apos;t cho@@ ose the sp@@ o@@ ken word .
You use sig@@ n language .
And in six months they can become solar engine@@ ers .
They go back and sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ f@@ y their own village .
"This woman went back and sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied the first village , set up a work@@ sho@@ p — the first village ever to be sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied in A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan &#91; was &#93; by the three women . This w@@ om@@ an@@ "
is an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary grand@@ mother .
"@@ 5@@ 5 years old , and she &apos;s sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied 200 h@@ ous@@ es for me in A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan ."
And they hav@@ en &apos;t col@@ l@@ ap@@ sed .
She actually went and sp@@ o@@ ke to an engine@@ er@@ ing de@@ par@@ t@@ ment in A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan and told the head of the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment the difference between A@@ C and D@@ C .
He didn &apos;t know .
Th@@ ose three women have tra@@ ined 2@@ 7 more women and sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied 100 vill@@ ages in A@@ f@@ ghan@@ istan .
"We went to A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , and we did the same thing ."
"A@@ ll these women sit@@ ting at one table from eight , n@@ ine countries , all ch@@ at@@ ting to each other , not understanding a word , because they &apos;re all speak@@ ing a different language ."
But their body language is great .
They &apos;re speak@@ ing to each other and actually becom@@ ing solar engine@@ ers .
"I went to S@@ ier@@ ra Le@@ one , and there was this min@@ is@@ ter driv@@ ing down in the de@@ ad of ni@@ ght — comes across this village ."
"C@@ om@@ es back , goes into the village , says , &quot; &quot; Well what &apos;s the story ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; These two grand@@ mothers ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ r@@ and@@ mothers ? &quot; &quot; The min@@ is@@ ter c@@ ouldn &apos;t believe what was happening ."
&quot; Wh@@ ere did they go ? &quot; &quot; W@@ ent to India and back . &quot;
W@@ ent stra@@ ight to the pres@@ ident .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know there &apos;s a sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied village in S@@ ier@@ ra Le@@ one ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; H@@ al@@ f the c@@ ab@@ inet went to see the grand@@ mothers the next day ."
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
"So he s@@ um@@ mon@@ ed me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you tra@@ in me 150 grand@@ mothers ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t , M@@ r@@ . P@@ res@@ ident ."
But they will . The grand@@ mothers will . &quot; &quot; So he built me the first B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot tra@@ in@@ ing center in S@@ ier@@ ra Le@@ one .
And 150 grand@@ mothers have been tra@@ ined in S@@ ier@@ ra Le@@ one .
G@@ amb@@ ia : we went to sel@@ ect a grand@@ mother in G@@ amb@@ ia .
W@@ ent to this village .
I knew which woman I would like to take .
"The commun@@ ity got together and said , &quot; &quot; T@@ ake these two women . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to take this woman . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Why ? She doesn &apos;t know the language . You don &apos;t know her . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I like the body language . I like the way she speak@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ if@@ fic@@ ult h@@ us@@ b@@ and ; not possible . &quot;"
"C@@ all@@ ed the h@@ us@@ b@@ and , the h@@ us@@ b@@ and came , s@@ w@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing , polit@@ ic@@ ian , mobil@@ e in his hand . &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; The woman , look how beautiful she is . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , she is very beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; What happens if she run@@ s off with an In@@ dian man ? &quot;"
That was his big@@ gest fear .
"I said , &quot; &quot; She &apos;ll be happy . She &apos;ll r@@ ing you up on the mobil@@ e . &quot; &quot; She went like a grand@@ mother and came back like a ti@@ ger ."
She wal@@ ked out of the plan@@ e and sp@@ o@@ ke to the whole pres@@ s as if she was a v@@ et@@ er@@ an .
"She h@@ and@@ led the national pres@@ s , and she was a star ."
"And when I went back six months later , I said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere &apos;s your h@@ us@@ b@@ and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , some@@ where . It doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) S@@ uc@@ c@@ ess story . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) I &apos;ll just w@@ ind up by saying that I think you don &apos;t have to look for sol@@ u@@ tions outside .
L@@ ook for sol@@ u@@ tions within .
And l@@ ist@@ en to people . They have the sol@@ u@@ tions in fron@@ t of you .
They &apos;re all over the world .
D@@ on &apos;t even wor@@ ry .
"D@@ on &apos;t l@@ ist@@ en to the World B@@ ank , l@@ ist@@ en to the people on the ground ."
They have all the sol@@ u@@ tions in the world .
I &apos;ll end with a quot@@ ation by M@@ a@@ h@@ at@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i .
"&quot; &quot; F@@ irst they ign@@ ore you , then they l@@ au@@ gh at you , then they fi@@ ght you , and then you w@@ in . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."

B@@ .@@ J@@ . was one of many f@@ ell@@ ow in@@ mat@@ es who had big plan@@ s for the future .
"He had a vision . Wh@@ en he got out , he was going to leave the do@@ p@@ e game for good and f@@ ly stra@@ ight , and he was actually working on mer@@ ging his two pas@@ sions into one vision ."
"He &apos;d sp@@ ent 1@@ 0,000 dollars to buy a w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite that ex@@ cl@@ us@@ iv@@ ely fe@@ at@@ ured women having sex on top of or inside of l@@ u@@ x@@ ur@@ y spor@@ ts c@@ ars . ( Laughter ) It was my first wee@@ k in f@@ ed@@ er@@ al pris@@ on , and I was learning quickly that it wasn &apos;t what you see on T@@ V ."
"In fact , it was te@@ em@@ ing with s@@ mart , amb@@ iti@@ ous men wh@@ ose b@@ usiness inst@@ inc@@ ts were in many c@@ as@@ es as shar@@ p as those of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had w@@ ined and din@@ ed me six months ear@@ li@@ er when I was a ris@@ ing star in the M@@ is@@ s@@ ou@@ ri S@@ en@@ ate ."
"Now , 9@@ 5 percent of the gu@@ ys that I was loc@@ ked up with had been dru@@ g de@@ al@@ ers on the outside , but when they tal@@ ked about what they did , they tal@@ ked about it in a different j@@ arg@@ on , but the b@@ usiness con@@ cep@@ ts that they tal@@ ked about wer@@ en &apos;t un@@ like those that you &apos;d learn in a first year M@@ B@@ A clas@@ s at Wh@@ art@@ on : pro@@ mo@@ tional inc@@ enti@@ ves , you never ch@@ arg@@ e a fir@@ st@@ -@@ time us@@ er , f@@ oc@@ us@@ -@@ gro@@ up@@ ing new produc@@ t la@@ un@@ ch@@ es , ter@@ rit@@ ori@@ al ex@@ pan@@ sion ."
But they didn &apos;t sp@@ end a lot of time rel@@ iv@@ ing the gl@@ ory days .
"For the most part , everyone was just trying to surv@@ ive ."
It &apos;s a lot har@@ der than you might think .
"C@@ on@@ tr@@ ary to what most people think , people don &apos;t pa@@ y , ta@@ x@@ pa@@ y@@ ers don &apos;t pa@@ y , for your life when you &apos;re in pris@@ on . You &apos;ve got to pa@@ y for your own life ."
"You &apos;ve got to pa@@ y for your so@@ a@@ p , your de@@ od@@ or@@ ant , to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush , to@@ o@@ th@@ pas@@ te , all of it ."
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reas@@ ons .
"F@@ irst , everything &apos;s mar@@ ked up 30 to 50 percent from what you &apos;d pa@@ y on the stre@@ et , and second , you don &apos;t make a lot of money ."
"I un@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed tr@@ uc@@ ks . That was my ful@@ l@@ -@@ time job , un@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing tr@@ uc@@ ks at a f@@ ood w@@ are@@ h@@ ou@@ se , for $ 5@@ .@@ 2@@ 5 , not an h@@ our , but per mon@@ th ."
So how do you surv@@ ive ?
"Well , you learn to hu@@ st@@ le , all kinds of hu@@ st@@ les ."
There &apos;s le@@ ga@@ l hu@@ st@@ les .
You pa@@ y everything in st@@ am@@ ps . Th@@ ose are the cur@@ r@@ en@@ cy .
You ch@@ arg@@ e another in@@ mate to c@@ le@@ an his cell .
"There &apos;s sort of il@@ le@@ ga@@ l hu@@ st@@ les , like you ru@@ n a bar@@ ber@@ sho@@ p out of your cell ."
There &apos;s pretty il@@ le@@ ga@@ l hu@@ st@@ les : You ru@@ n a t@@ at@@ too par@@ l@@ or out of your own cell .
"And there &apos;s very il@@ le@@ ga@@ l hu@@ st@@ les , which you sm@@ ug@@ g@@ le in , you get sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed in , dru@@ gs , por@@ n@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ y , cell ph@@ ones , and just as in the ou@@ ter world , there &apos;s a ris@@ k@@ -@@ re@@ ward tra@@ de@@ off , so the ris@@ ki@@ er the en@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise , the more prof@@ it@@ able it can p@@ ot@@ enti@@ ally be ."
You want a ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te in pris@@ on ? Th@@ ree to five dollars .
You want an ol@@ d@@ -@@ fa@@ shi@@ on@@ ed cell ph@@ one that you fli@@ p op@@ en and is about as big as your head ? Th@@ ree hundred b@@ uc@@ ks .
You want a d@@ ir@@ ty ma@@ gaz@@ ine ?
"Well , it can be as much as 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"So as you can probably tell , one of the defin@@ ing as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of pris@@ on life is ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity ."
"Wh@@ ether it was con@@ co@@ c@@ ting del@@ ici@@ ous me@@ als from st@@ ol@@ en sc@@ ra@@ ps from the w@@ are@@ h@@ ou@@ se , sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ting people &apos;s h@@ air with to@@ en@@ a@@ il cli@@ p@@ per@@ s , or con@@ struc@@ ting we@@ igh@@ ts from b@@ ould@@ ers in la@@ und@@ ry b@@ ag@@ s ti@@ ed on to tree lim@@ b@@ s , pris@@ on@@ ers learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity that they &apos;ve learned to the outside and start re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ an@@ ts , bar@@ ber sh@@ op@@ s , per@@ s@@ onal tra@@ in@@ ing b@@ us@@ in@@ ess@@ es ."
"But there &apos;s no tra@@ in@@ ing , nothing to pre@@ p@@ are them for that , no re@@ h@@ abil@@ itation at all in pris@@ on , no one to help them w@@ r@@ ite a b@@ usiness pl@@ an , fig@@ ure out a way to trans@@ l@@ ate the b@@ usiness con@@ cep@@ ts they in@@ tu@@ it@@ iv@@ ely gra@@ s@@ p into le@@ ga@@ l en@@ ter@@ pris@@ es , no acc@@ ess to the Inter@@ net , even ."
"And then , when they come out , most states don &apos;t even have a la@@ w pro@@ h@@ ib@@ iting em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ ers from dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ating against people with a bac@@ k@@ ground ."
So n@@ one of us should be sur@@ pris@@ ed that two out of three ex@@ -@@ of@@ f@@ end@@ ers re@@ -@@ of@@ f@@ end within five years .
"@@ L@@ ook , I li@@ ed to the F@@ ed@@ s . I lost a year of my life from it ."
"But when I came out , I vo@@ wed that I was going to do wh@@ at@@ ever I could to make sure that gu@@ ys like the ones I was loc@@ ked up with didn &apos;t have to was@@ te any more of their life than they already had ."
So I hop@@ e that you &apos;ll think about hel@@ ping in some way .
"The best thing we can do is fig@@ ure out ways to n@@ ur@@ ture the ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ i@@ al sp@@ ir@@ it and the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous un@@ t@@ app@@ ed p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al in our pris@@ ons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new sk@@ il@@ ls that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back ."
A@@ ll they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hu@@ st@@ les .
Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m here because I have a very important message : I think we have found the most important fac@@ tor for success .
"And it was found cl@@ ose to here , S@@ tan@@ for@@ d ."
"And he would tell the child , a f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old k@@ id , &quot; &quot; Jo@@ h@@ n@@ ny , I am going to leave you here with a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow for 15 minutes ."
"If , after I come back , this mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow is here , you will get another one . So you will have two . &quot; &quot; T@@ o tell a f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old k@@ id to wa@@ it 15 minutes for something that they like , is equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent to telling us , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll bring you co@@ f@@ fe@@ e in two h@@ ours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ x@@ act equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent ."
So what happened when the prof@@ ess@@ or left the room ?
A@@ s so@@ on as the do@@ or cl@@ os@@ ed ...
two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow .
"F@@ ive secon@@ ds , 10 secon@@ ds , 40 secon@@ ds , 50 secon@@ ds , two minutes , four minutes , eight minutes ."
S@@ ome las@@ ted 1@@ 4@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ half minutes .
( Laughter ) C@@ ouldn &apos;t do it . C@@ ould not wa@@ it .
What &apos;s interesting is that one out of three would look at the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow and go like this ...
W@@ ould look at it .
P@@ ut it back .
They would wal@@ k around . They would pl@@ ay with their sk@@ ir@@ ts and pan@@ ts .
"That child already , at four , underst@@ ood the most important princi@@ ple for success , which is the abil@@ ity to del@@ ay gra@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation ."
"@@ 15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follo@@ w@@ -@@ up study ."
What did they find ?
They went to look for these kids who were now 1@@ 8 and 1@@ 9 .
They were happy . They had their plan@@ s .
"They had good relation@@ shi@@ ps with the teachers , students ."
They were doing fin@@ e .
"A great per@@ cent@@ age of the kids that ate the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow , they were in tro@@ ub@@ le ."
They did not make it to univer@@ s@@ ity .
They had bad grad@@ es . S@@ ome of them dro@@ pped out .
And let me show you what happened .
"H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic kids , two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow ; one out of three did not ."
This little girl was interesting ; she ate the inside of the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow .
But she ate it .
"( Laughter ) She should not go into ban@@ king , for example , or work at a c@@ as@@ h re@@ g@@ is@@ ter ."
But she will be successful .
And this app@@ lies for everything . E@@ v@@ en in sa@@ les .
"If the sa@@ les person says , &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ it a second ."
I end with — the K@@ or@@ e@@ ans did this .
You know what ? This is so good that we want a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allow bo@@ ok for children .
We did one for children . And now it is all over K@@ or@@ ea .
They are teach@@ ing these kids exactly this princi@@ ple .
"And we need to learn that princi@@ ple here in the States , because we have a big d@@ ebt ."
We are e@@ ating more mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws than we are produc@@ ing .
Thank you so much .
"And I think , j@@ e@@ e@@ z , I &apos;m in the middle of a room of successful people !@@ "
I wasn &apos;t good enough ; I wasn &apos;t s@@ mart enough .
And there &apos;s no mag@@ ic to cre@@ ati@@ vity in coming up with ideas — it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .
"M@@ ight fa@@ il , k@@ id . D@@ on &apos;t make a lot of money at that , k@@ id ."
"M@@ ar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing did not say , &quot; I have a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are , &quot; when he in@@ sp@@ i@@ red the c@@ iv@@ il ri@@ ghts mov@@ ements ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I have a dre@@ am . &quot; &quot; And I have a dre@@ am ."
"I have a dre@@ am that we can stop thinking that the future will be a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are , and this is going to be a challenge , because , if you think of every ma@@ j@@ or b@@ loc@@ k@@ bu@@ st@@ ing fil@@ m of rec@@ ent times , ne@@ arly all of its vis@@ ions for hum@@ an@@ ity are ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ tic ."
"I think this fil@@ m is one of the har@@ d@@ est wat@@ ch@@ es of modern times , &quot; &quot; The R@@ o@@ ad . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful piece of fil@@ m@@ making , but everything is des@@ ol@@ ate , everything is de@@ ad ."
"And just a father and son trying to surv@@ ive , walking along the ro@@ ad ."
And I think the environ@@ mental movement of which I am a part of has been compl@@ icit in cre@@ ating this vision of the future .
"For too long , we have p@@ ed@@ dl@@ ed a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ mar@@ ish vision of what &apos;s going to happen ."
We have f@@ oc@@ used on the wor@@ st@@ -@@ case scen@@ ari@@ o .
We have f@@ oc@@ used on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the sol@@ u@@ tions .
"We &apos;ve used fear , if you like , to gra@@ b people &apos;s att@@ en@@ tion ."
And any psych@@ olog@@ ist will tell you that fear in the organ@@ ism is l@@ in@@ ked to f@@ light me@@ chan@@ ism .
"It &apos;s part of the fi@@ ght and f@@ light me@@ chan@@ ism , that when an an@@ ima@@ l is fri@@ gh@@ t@@ en@@ ed — think of a de@@ er ."
"A de@@ er fre@@ ez@@ es very , very still , po@@ ised to ru@@ n away ."
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re asking people to en@@ ga@@ ge with our ag@@ en@@ da around environ@@ mental de@@ gra@@ da@@ tion and cli@@ mate change .
People are fre@@ ez@@ ing and run@@ ning away because we &apos;re using fear .
And I think the environ@@ mental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is .
What would it be like to be impro@@ v@@ ing the human lot ?
"And one of the problems that we face , I think , is that the only people that have cor@@ ner@@ ed the mark@@ et in terms of progress is a fin@@ an@@ cial defin@@ ition of what progress is , an economic defin@@ ition of what progress is — that some@@ how , if we get the right numbers to go up , we &apos;re going to be better off , whether that &apos;s on the st@@ ock mark@@ et , whether that &apos;s with G@@ D@@ P and economic growth , that some@@ how life is going to get better ."
This is some@@ how ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing to human gre@@ ed instead of fear — that more is better .
"C@@ ome on . In the W@@ es@@ tern world , we have enough ."
"M@@ aybe some parts of the world don &apos;t , but we have enough ."
And we &apos;ve know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the w@@ el@@ f@@ are of na@@ tions .
"In fact , the arch@@ it@@ ect of our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system , S@@ i@@ mon K@@ uz@@ n@@ ets , in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , said that , &quot; &quot; A na@@ tion &apos;s w@@ el@@ f@@ are can sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely be in@@ fer@@ red from their national income . &quot; &quot; But we &apos;ve created a national ac@@ coun@@ ting system which is fir@@ m@@ ly based on produc@@ tion and produc@@ ing stuff ."
"And inde@@ ed , this is probably hist@@ or@@ ical , and it had its time ."
"In the second World War , we needed to produce a lot of stuff ."
"And inde@@ ed , we were so successful at produc@@ ing certain typ@@ es of stuff that we des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed a lot of Eu@@ rop@@ e , and we had to reb@@ u@@ il@@ d it af@@ ter@@ wards ."
And so our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system bec@@ ame fi@@ x@@ ated on what we can produce .
"But as early as 19@@ 6@@ 8 , this vis@@ ion@@ ary man , R@@ ob@@ ert K@@ en@@ n@@ ed@@ y , at the start of his ill@@ -@@ f@@ ated pres@@ id@@ enti@@ al cam@@ pa@@ ign , gave the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent de@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of gro@@ ss national produc@@ t that ever has been ."
"And he fin@@ i@@ shed his talk with the ph@@ ra@@ se , that , &quot; &quot; The gro@@ ss national produc@@ t meas@@ ures everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while . &quot; &quot; How cra@@ z@@ y is that ? That our measure of progress , our domin@@ ant measure of progress in society , is meas@@ uring everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while ?"
"I believe , if K@@ en@@ n@@ ed@@ y was al@@ ive today , he would be asking stat@@ is@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans such as myself to go out and find out what makes life wor@@ th@@ while ."
"He &apos;d be asking us to re@@ des@@ ign our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system to be based up@@ on such important things as social j@@ us@@ tice , su@@ st@@ ain@@ abil@@ ity and people &apos;s well-being ."
"And actually , social scient@@ ists have already g@@ one out and asked these questions around the world ."
This is from a global surv@@ ey .
"It &apos;s asking people , what do they want ."
"And un@@ sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly , people all around the world say that what they want is happiness , for themselves , for their famil@@ ies , their children , their commun@@ ities ."
"O@@ kay , they think money is s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly important ."
"It &apos;s there , but it &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as happiness , and it &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as love ."
We all need to love and be lov@@ ed in life .
It &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as health .
We want to be heal@@ thy and live a ful@@ l life .
These seem to be natural human as@@ pira@@ tions .
Why are stat@@ is@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans not meas@@ uring these ?
"Wh@@ y are we not thinking of the progress of na@@ tions in these terms , instead of just how much stuff we have ?"
"And really , this is what I &apos;ve done with my ad@@ ult life — is think about how do we measure happiness , how do we measure well-being , how can we do that within environ@@ mental lim@@ its ."
"And we created , at the organiz@@ ation that I work for , the New E@@ con@@ om@@ ics F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion , something we call the H@@ app@@ y P@@ lan@@ et In@@ de@@ x , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy ."
Why don &apos;t we create a measure of progress that sho@@ ws that ?
"And what we do , is we say that the ul@@ ti@@ mate ou@@ t@@ come of a na@@ tion is how successful is it at cre@@ ating happy and heal@@ thy lives for its c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens ."
That should be the go@@ al of every na@@ tion on the planet .
"But we have to remem@@ ber that there &apos;s a fundam@@ ental in@@ put to that , and that is how many of the planet &apos;s resour@@ ces we use ."
We all have one planet . We all have to share it .
"It is the ul@@ ti@@ mate sc@@ ar@@ ce resour@@ ce , the one planet that we share ."
And econom@@ ics is very interes@@ ted in sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ity .
"When it has a sc@@ ar@@ ce resour@@ ce that it wan@@ ts to turn into a des@@ i@@ ra@@ ble ou@@ t@@ come , it thin@@ ks in terms of ef@@ fici@@ en@@ cy ."
It thin@@ ks in terms of how much ban@@ g do we get for our b@@ uc@@ k .
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our plan@@ et@@ ary resour@@ ce use .
It is an ef@@ fici@@ en@@ cy measure .
"And probably the eas@@ i@@ est way to show you that , is to show you this graph ."
"@@ R@@ un@@ ning horiz@@ on@@ t@@ ally along the graph , is &quot; &quot; ec@@ ological fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t , &quot; &quot; which is a measure of how much resour@@ ces we use and how much pres@@ sure we put on the planet ."
M@@ ore is bad .
"@@ R@@ un@@ ning ver@@ tically up@@ wards , is a measure called &quot; &quot; happy life years . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about the well-being of na@@ tions ."
It &apos;s like a happiness ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ed li@@ fe@@ -@@ expec@@ tan@@ cy .
It &apos;s like qu@@ ality and quan@@ t@@ ity of life in na@@ tions .
"And the y@@ ell@@ ow d@@ ot there you see , is the global average ."
"Now , there &apos;s a hu@@ ge ar@@ ra@@ y of na@@ tions around that global average ."
"T@@ o the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reas@@ on@@ ably well and produc@@ ing well-being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there ."
"They are the U.S@@ .@@ A@@ . , other W@@ es@@ tern countries going across in those tri@@ an@@ gl@@ es and a few G@@ ul@@ f states in there actually ."
"C@@ on@@ ver@@ s@@ ely , at the bot@@ tom left of the graph , are countries that are not produc@@ ing much well-being — t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally , sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a ."
"In H@@ ob@@ b@@ es@@ ian terms , life is shor@@ t and br@@ ut@@ ish there ."
The average life expec@@ tan@@ cy in many of these countries is only 40 years .
"M@@ al@@ aria , H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S are kil@@ l@@ ing a lot of people in these regi@@ ons of the world ."
But now for the good news !
"There are some countries up there , y@@ ell@@ ow tri@@ an@@ gl@@ es , that are doing better than global average , that are he@@ ad@@ ing up to@@ wards the top left of the graph ."
This is an as@@ pira@@ tional graph .
"We want to be top left , where good lives don &apos;t cost the ear@@ th ."
They &apos;re L@@ ati@@ n American .
The country on its own up at the top is a place I hav@@ en &apos;t been to .
M@@ aybe some of you have .
C@@ os@@ ta R@@ ic@@ a .
C@@ os@@ ta R@@ ic@@ a — average life expec@@ tan@@ cy is 7@@ 8@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ half years .
That is longer than in the U@@ S@@ A .
"They are , acc@@ ord@@ ing to the l@@ at@@ est G@@ all@@ up world pol@@ l , the happ@@ i@@ est na@@ tion on the planet — than any@@ body ; more than S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ l@@ and and D@@ en@@ mar@@ k ."
They are the happ@@ i@@ est place .
They are doing that on a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the resour@@ ces that are used t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally in &#91; the &#93; W@@ es@@ tern world — a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the resour@@ ces .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in C@@ os@@ ta R@@ ic@@ a ?
We can look at some of the data .
9@@ 9 percent of their elec@@ tric@@ ity comes from r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able resour@@ ces .
Th@@ e@@ ir govern@@ ment is one of the first to com@@ mit to be car@@ b@@ on ne@@ ut@@ ral by 20@@ 2@@ 1 .
They ab@@ ol@@ i@@ shed the ar@@ my in 19@@ 4@@ 9 — 19@@ 4@@ 9 .
And they inv@@ es@@ ted in social program@@ s — health and education .
They have one of the high@@ est liter@@ ac@@ y ra@@ t@@ es in L@@ ati@@ n America and in the world .
"And they have that L@@ ati@@ n vi@@ be , don &apos;t they ."
They have the social connec@@ t@@ ed@@ ness .
"( Laughter ) The challenge is , that possi@@ bly — and the thing we might have to think about — is that the future might not be N@@ or@@ th American , might not be W@@ es@@ tern Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an ."
It might be L@@ ati@@ n American .
"And the challenge , really , is to pul@@ l the global average up here ."
That &apos;s what we need to do .
"And if we &apos;re going to do that , we need to pul@@ l countries from the bot@@ tom , and we need to pul@@ l countries from the right of the graph ."
And then we &apos;re star@@ ting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
A@@ n@@ other way of looking at it is looking at time tr@@ ends .
"We don &apos;t have good data going back for every country in the world , but for some of the ri@@ ch@@ est countries , the O@@ E@@ C@@ D group , we do ."
"And this is the tr@@ end in well-being over that time , a small increase , but this is the tr@@ end in ec@@ ological fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t ."
"And so in str@@ ic@@ t happ@@ y-@@ planet me@@ th@@ od@@ ology , we &apos;ve become less ef@@ fici@@ ent at turn@@ ing our ul@@ ti@@ mate sc@@ ar@@ ce resour@@ ce into the ou@@ t@@ come we want to ."
"And the point really is , is that I think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 20@@ 50 without an ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ tic something happening ."
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human li@@ fe@@ time away .
A child en@@ ter@@ ing school today will be my age in 20@@ 50 .
This is not the very dis@@ tant future .
This is what the U.@@ K@@ . govern@@ ment t@@ arg@@ et on car@@ b@@ on and gre@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ se em@@ is@@ sions looks like .
"And I put it to you , that is not b@@ usiness as us@@ ual ."
That is chang@@ ing our b@@ usiness .
"That is chang@@ ing the way we create our organiz@@ ations , we do our govern@@ ment pol@@ ic@@ y and we live our lives ."
"And the point is , we need to car@@ ry on increas@@ ing well-being ."
No one can go to the pol@@ ls and say that qu@@ ality of life is going to re@@ duc@@ e .
"@@ N@@ one of us , I think , want human progress to stop ."
I think we want it to car@@ ry on .
I think we want the lot of hum@@ an@@ ity to keep on increas@@ ing .
And I think this is where cli@@ mate change sk@@ e@@ p@@ tics and den@@ i@@ ers come in .
I think this is what they want . They want qu@@ ality of life to keep increas@@ ing .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
"And if we &apos;re going to en@@ ga@@ ge them , I think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do ."
And that means we have to really increase ef@@ fici@@ en@@ cy even more .
"Now that &apos;s all very easy to dra@@ w gra@@ ph@@ s and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those cur@@ ves ."
"And this is where I think we can take a le@@ a@@ f out of sy@@ st@@ ems theory , sy@@ st@@ ems engine@@ ers , where they create fe@@ ed@@ back loo@@ ps , put the right information at the right point of time ."
"H@@ u@@ man be@@ ings are very mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated by the &quot; &quot; now . &quot; &quot; You put a s@@ mart me@@ ter in your home , and you see how much elec@@ tric@@ ity you &apos;re using right now , how much it &apos;s c@@ os@@ ting you , your kids go around and turn the li@@ ghts off pretty quickly ."
What would that look like for society ?
"Wh@@ y is it , on the radi@@ o news every ev@@ ening , I hear the F@@ T@@ S@@ E 100 , the D@@ ow J@@ ones , the doll@@ ar p@@ ound ra@@ ti@@ o — I don &apos;t even know which way the doll@@ ar p@@ ound ra@@ ti@@ o should go to be good news ."
And why do I hear that ?
"Wh@@ y don &apos;t I hear how much energy Brit@@ ain used y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , or American used y@@ es@@ ter@@ day ?"
D@@ id we me@@ et our three percent an@@ n@@ ual t@@ arg@@ et on re@@ duc@@ ing car@@ b@@ on em@@ is@@ sions ?
That &apos;s how you create a col@@ lec@@ tive go@@ al .
You put it out there into the med@@ ia and start thinking about it .
"And we need positive fe@@ ed@@ back loo@@ ps for increas@@ ing well-being A@@ t a govern@@ ment level , they might create national ac@@ coun@@ ts of well-being ."
"A@@ t a b@@ usiness level , you might look at the well-being of your em@@ pl@@ o@@ ye@@ es , which we know is really l@@ in@@ ked to cre@@ ati@@ vity , which is l@@ in@@ ked to in@@ nov@@ ation , and we &apos;re going to need a lot of in@@ nov@@ ation to de@@ al with those environ@@ mental issu@@ es ."
"A@@ t a per@@ s@@ onal level , we need these n@@ ud@@ g@@ es too ."
"M@@ aybe we don &apos;t quite need the data , but we need re@@ min@@ d@@ ers ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , we have a strong publi@@ c health message on five f@@ ru@@ it and ve@@ g@@ et@@ ab@@ les a day and how much ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise we should do — never my best thing ."
What are these for happiness ?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happ@@ i@@ er ?
"We did a project for the G@@ overn@@ ment O@@ f@@ fic@@ e of S@@ ci@@ ence a couple of years ago , a big prog@@ ram called the F@@ or@@ es@@ ight prog@@ ram — lots and lots of people — inv@@ ol@@ ved lots of exp@@ ert@@ s — everything evidence based — a hu@@ ge to@@ me ."
But a piece of work we did was on : what five positive ac@@ tions can you do to impro@@ ve well-being in your life ?
"And the point of these is they are , not quite , the sec@@ re@@ ts of happiness , but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from ."
"And the first of these is to con@@ n@@ ect , is that your social relation@@ shi@@ ps are the most important cor@@ ner@@ st@@ ones of your life ."
"@@ Do you inv@@ est the time with your lov@@ ed ones that you could do , and energy ?"
K@@ e@@ ep buil@@ ding them .
The second one is be ac@@ tive .
"The fas@@ test way out of a bad mo@@ od : ste@@ p outside , go for a wal@@ k , turn the radi@@ o on and dan@@ ce ."
B@@ e@@ ing ac@@ tive is great for our positive mo@@ od .
The th@@ ir@@ d one is take not@@ ice .
"@@ How a@@ w@@ are are you of things going on around the world , the se@@ as@@ ons chang@@ ing , people around you ?"
Do you not@@ ice what &apos;s bub@@ bl@@ ing up for you and trying to emer@@ ge ?
"B@@ as@@ ed on a lot of evidence for min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness , c@@ ogn@@ itive behav@@ i@@ or@@ al ther@@ ap@@ y , &#91; very &#93; strong for our well being ."
The f@@ our@@ th is keep learning and keep is important — learning throu@@ gh@@ out the whole life course .
"O@@ l@@ der people who keep learning and are cur@@ i@@ ous , they have much better health ou@@ t@@ comes than those who start to cl@@ ose down ."
But it doesn &apos;t have to be forma@@ l learning ; it &apos;s not kno@@ w@@ l@@ edge based .
It &apos;s more cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
"It can be learning to co@@ ok a new dis@@ h , pic@@ king up an in@@ str@@ ument you for@@ got as a child ."
K@@ e@@ ep learning .
"And the fin@@ al one is that most an@@ ti@@ -@@ economic of acti@@ v@@ ities , but give ."
"O@@ ur gener@@ os@@ ity , our al@@ tr@@ u@@ ism , our compassion , are all har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to the re@@ ward me@@ chan@@ ism in our brain ."
We feel good if we give .
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the mor@@ ning .
You tell one of them to sp@@ end it on themselves and one on other people .
"You measure their happiness at the end of the day , those that have g@@ one and sp@@ ent on other people are much happ@@ i@@ er that those that sp@@ ent it on themselves ."
"And these five ways , which we put on@@ to these h@@ and@@ y pos@@ t@@ car@@ ds , I would say , don &apos;t have to cost the ear@@ th ."
They don &apos;t have any car@@ b@@ on cont@@ ent .
They don &apos;t need a lot of material go@@ od@@ s to be sat@@ is@@ fied .
And so I think it &apos;s really quite fe@@ as@@ ible that happiness does not cost the ear@@ th .
"Now , Mar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , on the eve of his de@@ ath , gave an incredible spe@@ ec@@ h ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I know there are challen@@ g@@ es a@@ head , there may be tro@@ ub@@ le a@@ head , but I fear no one . I don &apos;t care ."
"I have been to the mo@@ un@@ tain top , and I have seen the P@@ rom@@ ised L@@ and . &quot; &quot; Now , he was a pre@@ ach@@ er , but I believe the environ@@ mental movement and , in fact , the b@@ usiness commun@@ ity , govern@@ ment , need@@ s to go to the top of the mo@@ un@@ tain top , and it need@@ s to look out , and it need@@ s to see the P@@ rom@@ ised L@@ and , or the l@@ and of p@@ rom@@ ise , and it need@@ s to have a vision of a world that we all want ."
"And not only that , we need to create a G@@ re@@ at Trans@@ ition to get there , and we need to p@@ ave that great trans@@ ition with good things ."
H@@ u@@ man be@@ ings want to be happy .
P@@ ave them with the five ways .
And we need to have sign@@ pos@@ ts ga@@ ther@@ ing people together and poin@@ ting them — something like the H@@ app@@ y P@@ lan@@ et In@@ de@@ x .
"And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want , where happiness does not cost the ear@@ th ."

A few months ago the N@@ ob@@ el P@@ ri@@ ze in physics was a@@ war@@ ded to two te@@ ams of ast@@ ronom@@ ers for a disc@@ ov@@ ery that has been ha@@ il@@ ed as one of the most important ast@@ ronom@@ ical observ@@ ations ever .
"And today , after bri@@ ef@@ ly describ@@ ing what they found , I &apos;m going to tell you about a high@@ ly contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al fra@@ me@@ work for expl@@ ain@@ ing their disc@@ ov@@ ery , nam@@ ely the possibil@@ ity that way be@@ y@@ ond the Earth , the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay and other dis@@ tant galaxies , we may find that our universe is not the only universe , but is instead part of a v@@ ast compl@@ e@@ x of universes that we call the multi@@ ver@@ se ."
Now the idea of a multi@@ ver@@ se is a strange one .
"I mean , most of us were ra@@ ised to believe that the word &quot; &quot; universe &quot; &quot; means everything ."
"And I say most of us with for@@ e@@ thought , as my f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born ."
"And last year I was hol@@ ding her and I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ o@@ ph@@ ia , I love you more than anything in the universe . &quot; &quot; And she turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ d@@ y , universe or multi@@ ver@@ se ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But bar@@ r@@ ing such an an@@ om@@ al@@ ous up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing , it is strange to imagine other real@@ ms se@@ par@@ ate from ours , most with fundam@@ ent@@ ally different fe@@ atures , that would ri@@ gh@@ tly be called universes of their own ."
"And yet , spec@@ ul@@ ative though the idea sur@@ ely is , I a@@ im to con@@ vin@@ ce you that there &apos;s reason for tak@@ ing it seri@@ ously , as it just might be right ."
I &apos;m going to tell the story of the multi@@ ver@@ se in three parts .
"In part one , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be those N@@ ob@@ el P@@ ri@@ ze@@ -@@ w@@ in@@ ning results and to high@@ light a pro@@ found my@@ st@@ ery which those results re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed ."
"In part two , I &apos;ll of@@ fer a sol@@ ution to that my@@ st@@ ery ."
"It &apos;s based on an approach called string theory , and that &apos;s where the idea of the multi@@ ver@@ se will come into the story ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , in part three , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be a c@@ osmo@@ log@@ ical theory called in@@ fl@@ ation , which will pul@@ l all the piec@@ es of the story together ."
"O@@ kay , part one star@@ ts back in 19@@ 2@@ 9 when the great ast@@ ronom@@ er E@@ d@@ w@@ in H@@ ub@@ ble realiz@@ ed that the dis@@ tant galaxies were all r@@ ush@@ ing away from us , est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing that space itself is stre@@ t@@ ch@@ ing , it &apos;s exp@@ anding ."
Now this was re@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary .
The pre@@ va@@ il@@ ing w@@ is@@ dom was that on the larg@@ est of sc@@ al@@ es the universe was st@@ ati@@ c .
"But even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : The ex@@ pan@@ sion must be s@@ lo@@ wing down ."
"That , much as the grav@@ it@@ ati@@ onal pul@@ l of the Earth s@@ lo@@ ws the as@@ cent of an ap@@ ple t@@ os@@ sed up@@ ward , the grav@@ it@@ ati@@ onal pul@@ l of each galax@@ y on every other must be s@@ lo@@ wing the ex@@ pan@@ sion of space ."
Now let &apos;s fas@@ t@@ -@@ for@@ ward to the 19@@ 9@@ 0s when those two te@@ ams of ast@@ ronom@@ ers I men@@ tion@@ ed at the outs@@ et were in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by this reas@@ on@@ ing to measure the ra@@ te at which the ex@@ pan@@ sion has been s@@ lo@@ wing .
"And they did this by pain@@ st@@ ak@@ ing observ@@ ations of n@@ um@@ er@@ ous dis@@ tant galaxies , allo@@ wing them to ch@@ art how the ex@@ pan@@ sion ra@@ te has changed over time ."
Here &apos;s the sur@@ pr@@ ise : They found that the ex@@ pan@@ sion is not s@@ lo@@ wing down .
"In@@ ste@@ ad they found that it &apos;s spe@@ ed@@ ing up , going fas@@ ter and fas@@ ter ."
That &apos;s like t@@ os@@ sing an ap@@ ple up@@ ward and it goes up fas@@ ter and fas@@ ter .
"Now if you saw an ap@@ ple do that , you &apos;d want to know why ."
What &apos;s p@@ ush@@ ing on it ?
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , the ast@@ ronom@@ ers &apos; results are sur@@ ely well-@@ des@@ er@@ v@@ ing of the N@@ ob@@ el P@@ ri@@ ze , but they ra@@ ised an anal@@ og@@ ous question ."
What force is driv@@ ing all galaxies to r@@ ush away from every other at an ever@@ -@@ quick@@ ening spe@@ ed ?
Well the most p@@ rom@@ is@@ ing answer comes from an old idea of E@@ instein &apos;s .
"You see , we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing , pul@@ ls ob@@ jects together ."
"But in E@@ instein &apos;s theory of gravity , his gener@@ al theory of relati@@ vity , gravity can also p@@ ush things ap@@ art ."
"@@ How ? Well acc@@ ord@@ ing to E@@ instein &apos;s mat@@ h , if space is uni@@ form@@ ly fil@@ led with an inv@@ is@@ ible energy , sort of like a uni@@ form , inv@@ is@@ ible mis@@ t , then the gravity gener@@ ated by that mis@@ t would be re@@ pul@@ sive , re@@ pul@@ sive gravity , which is just what we need to explain the observ@@ ations ."
"Because the re@@ pul@@ sive gravity of an inv@@ is@@ ible energy in space — we now call it dark energy , but I &apos;ve made it s@@ mok@@ ey wh@@ ite here so you can see it — its re@@ pul@@ sive gravity would cause each galax@@ y to p@@ ush against every other , driv@@ ing ex@@ pan@@ sion to spe@@ ed up , not s@@ low down ."
And this ex@@ plan@@ ation re@@ pres@@ ents great progress .
But I p@@ rom@@ ised you a my@@ st@@ ery here in part one .
Here it is .
"When the ast@@ ronom@@ ers worked out how much of this dark energy must be in@@ f@@ using space to ac@@ coun@@ t for the c@@ os@@ mic spe@@ ed up , look at what they found ."
This number is small .
"E@@ x@@ pres@@ sed in the rel@@ ev@@ ant un@@ it , it is spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ arly small ."
And the my@@ st@@ ery is to explain this p@@ ec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar number .
"We want this number to emer@@ ge from the la@@ ws of physics , but so far no one has found a way to do that ."
"Now you might won@@ der , should you care ?"
"M@@ aybe expl@@ ain@@ ing this number is just a techn@@ ical issue , a techn@@ ical deta@@ il of inter@@ est to exp@@ ert@@ s , but of no rel@@ ev@@ ance to any@@ body else ."
"Well it sur@@ ely is a techn@@ ical deta@@ il , but some deta@@ ils really matter ."
"S@@ ome deta@@ ils pro@@ v@@ ide w@@ indo@@ ws into un@@ char@@ ted real@@ ms of reality , and this p@@ ec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar number may be doing just that , as the only approach that &apos;s so far made he@@ ad@@ way to explain it inv@@ ok@@ es the possibil@@ ity of other universes — an idea that nat@@ ur@@ ally emer@@ g@@ es from string theory , which takes me to part two : string theory ."
So hold the my@@ st@@ ery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three k@@ ey things about string theory .
"F@@ irst off , what is it ?"
"Well it &apos;s an approach to real@@ ize E@@ instein &apos;s dre@@ am of a uni@@ fied theory of physics , a single over@@ arch@@ ing fra@@ me@@ work that would be able to descri@@ be all the for@@ ces at work in the universe ."
And the cent@@ ral idea of string theory is quite stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward .
"It says that if you exam@@ ine any piece of matter ever more fin@@ ely , at first you &apos;ll find molecul@@ es and then you &apos;ll find atoms and sub@@ at@@ omi@@ c particles ."
"But the theory says that if you could pro@@ be sm@@ all@@ er , much sm@@ all@@ er than we can with ex@@ is@@ ting technology , you &apos;d find something else inside these particles — a little tiny vibra@@ ting fil@@ am@@ ent of energy , a little tiny vibra@@ ting string ."
"And just like the str@@ ings on a viol@@ in , they can vibra@@ te in different pat@@ ter@@ n@@ s produc@@ ing different mus@@ ical not@@ es ."
"Th@@ ese little fundam@@ ental str@@ ings , when they vibra@@ te in different pat@@ ter@@ n@@ s , they produce different kinds of particles — so elec@@ t@@ rons , qu@@ ar@@ ks , ne@@ ut@@ r@@ in@@ os , ph@@ ot@@ ons , all other particles would be un@@ ited into a single fra@@ me@@ work , as they would all ar@@ ise from vibra@@ ting str@@ ings ."
"It &apos;s a comp@@ elling picture , a kind of c@@ os@@ mic sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y , where all the ri@@ chn@@ ess that we see in the world around us emer@@ g@@ es from the music that these little , tiny str@@ ings can pl@@ ay ."
"But there &apos;s a cost to this el@@ e@@ gan@@ t uni@@ fic@@ ation , because years of research have sho@@ wn that the mat@@ h of string theory doesn &apos;t quite work ."
"It has inter@@ n@@ al in@@ cons@@ ist@@ en@@ ci@@ es , un@@ less we allow for something wh@@ ol@@ ly un@@ famil@@ i@@ ar — extra dimensions of space ."
"That is , we all know about the us@@ ual three dimensions of space ."
"And you can think about those as he@@ ight , w@@ id@@ th and dep@@ th ."
"But string theory says that , on f@@ ant@@ as@@ tically small sc@@ al@@ es , there are ad@@ diti@@ onal dimensions c@@ r@@ um@@ pl@@ ed to a tiny si@@ ze so small that we have not det@@ ec@@ ted them ."
"But even though the dimensions are h@@ id@@ den , they would have an im@@ p@@ act on things that we can ob@@ ser@@ ve because the shape of the extra dimensions con@@ stra@@ ins how the str@@ ings can vibra@@ te ."
"And in string theory , vibra@@ tion de@@ ter@@ min@@ es everything ."
"So partic@@ le mas@@ ses , the str@@ en@@ g@@ ths of for@@ ces , and most impor@@ tan@@ tly , the amount of dark energy would be de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed by the shape of the extra dimensions ."
"So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions , we should be able to cal@@ cul@@ ate these fe@@ atures , cal@@ cul@@ ate the amount of dark energy ."
The challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
A@@ ll we have is a l@@ ist of can@@ dida@@ te shap@@ es allowed by the mat@@ h .
"Now when these ideas were first developed , there were only about five different can@@ dida@@ te shap@@ es , so you can imagine anal@@ y@@ zing them on@@ e-@@ b@@ y-@@ one to de@@ ter@@ min@@ e if any y@@ i@@ el@@ d the physical fe@@ atures we ob@@ ser@@ ve ."
But over time the l@@ ist gre@@ w as rese@@ arch@@ ers found other can@@ dida@@ te shap@@ es .
"F@@ rom five , the number gre@@ w into the hund@@ re@@ ds and then the thousands — A large , but still man@@ ag@@ e@@ able , col@@ lec@@ tion to anal@@ y@@ ze , since after all , grad@@ u@@ ate students need something to do ."
"But then the l@@ ist contin@@ u@@ ed to grow into the mil@@ lions and the bil@@ lions , until today ."
The l@@ ist of can@@ dida@@ te shap@@ es has so@@ ar@@ ed to about 10 to the 5@@ 00 .
"So , what to do ?"
"Well some rese@@ arch@@ ers lost heart , con@@ cl@@ ud@@ ing that was so many can@@ dida@@ te shap@@ es for the extra dimensions , each giving r@@ ise to different physical fe@@ atures , string theory would never make defin@@ itive , t@@ est@@ able predic@@ tions ."
"But others turned this issue on its head , tak@@ ing us to the possibil@@ ity of a multi@@ ver@@ se ."
Here &apos;s the idea .
M@@ aybe each of these shap@@ es is on an equal fo@@ ot@@ ing with every other .
"E@@ ach is as real as every other , in the sense that there are many universes , each with a different shape , for the extra dimensions ."
And this rad@@ ical pro@@ po@@ sa@@ l has a pro@@ found im@@ p@@ act on this my@@ st@@ ery : the amount of dark energy re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed by the N@@ ob@@ el P@@ ri@@ ze@@ -@@ w@@ in@@ ning results .
"Because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the physical fe@@ atures of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different ."
Wh@@ ich means that the my@@ st@@ ery of expl@@ ain@@ ing the amount of dark energy we &apos;ve now meas@@ ured would take on a wh@@ ol@@ ly different char@@ ac@@ ter .
"In this cont@@ ex@@ t , the la@@ ws of physics can &apos;t explain one number for the dark energy because there isn &apos;t just one number , there are many numbers ."
Wh@@ ich means we have been asking the wrong question .
"It &apos;s that the right question to ask is , why do we hum@@ ans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve meas@@ ured instead of any of the other possibil@@ ities that are out there ?"
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make he@@ ad@@ way .
"Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours , wh@@ en@@ ever matter tries to cl@@ um@@ p into galaxies , the re@@ pul@@ sive p@@ ush of the dark energy is so strong that it blo@@ ws the cl@@ um@@ p ap@@ art and galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they col@@ l@@ ap@@ se back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And without galaxies , there are no stars , no planets and no chan@@ ce for our form of life to ex@@ ist in those other universes ."
So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve meas@@ ured simply because our universe has con@@ diti@@ ons h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ able to our form of life .
And that would be that .
"M@@ y@@ st@@ ery sol@@ ved , multi@@ ver@@ se found ."
Now some find this ex@@ plan@@ ation un@@ sat@@ is@@ f@@ ying .
We &apos;re used to physics giving us defin@@ itive ex@@ plan@@ ations for the fe@@ atures we ob@@ ser@@ ve .
"But the point is , if the fe@@ ature you &apos;re observ@@ ing can and does take on a w@@ ide vari@@ ety of different val@@ ues across the w@@ ider l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of reality , then thinking one ex@@ plan@@ ation for a particular val@@ ue is simply mis@@ gu@@ id@@ ed ."
A@@ n early example comes from the great ast@@ ronom@@ er Jo@@ h@@ an@@ nes K@@ e@@ pl@@ er who was ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with understanding a different number — why the Sun is 9@@ 3 million mil@@ es away from the Earth .
"And he worked for dec@@ ad@@ es trying to explain this number , but he never suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed , and we know why ."
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er was asking the wrong question .
We now know that there are many planets at a w@@ ide vari@@ ety of different dis@@ tan@@ ces from their h@@ ost stars .
"So hop@@ ing that the la@@ ws of physics will explain one particular number , 9@@ 3 million mil@@ es , well that is simply w@@ ron@@ gh@@ e@@ ad@@ ed ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad the right question to ask is , why do we hum@@ ans find ourselves on a planet at this particular dis@@ tan@@ ce , instead of any of the other possibil@@ ities ?"
"And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer ."
Th@@ ose planets which are much cl@@ os@@ er to a star like the Sun would be so h@@ ot that our form of life wouldn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
"And those planets that are much far@@ ther away from the star , well they &apos;re so c@@ old that , again , our form of life would not take hold ."
So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular dis@@ tan@@ ce simply because it y@@ i@@ el@@ ds con@@ diti@@ ons v@@ ital to our form of life .
"And when it comes to planets and their dis@@ tan@@ ces , this c@@ lear@@ ly is the right kind of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"The point is , when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they con@@ tain , it may also be the right kind of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"One k@@ ey difference , of course , is we know that there are other planets out there , but so far I &apos;ve only spec@@ ul@@ ated on the possibil@@ ity that there might be other universes ."
"So to pul@@ l it all together , we need a me@@ chan@@ ism that can actually gener@@ ate other universes ."
"And that takes me to my fin@@ al part , part three ."
Because such a me@@ chan@@ ism has been found by c@@ osmo@@ log@@ ists trying to understand the Big Bang .
"You see , when we speak of the Big Bang , we of@@ ten have an imag@@ e of a kind of c@@ os@@ mic expl@@ os@@ ion that created our universe and set space r@@ ush@@ ing ou@@ tw@@ ard ."
But there &apos;s a little sec@@ ret .
"The Big Bang le@@ av@@ es out something pretty important , the Bang ."
"It t@@ ells us how the universe evol@@ ved after the Bang , but giv@@ es us no in@@ sight into what would have po@@ wer@@ ed the Bang itself ."
And this ga@@ p was finally fil@@ led by an en@@ h@@ an@@ ced ver@@ sion of the Big Bang theory .
"It &apos;s called in@@ fl@@ ati@@ on@@ ary c@@ osmo@@ log@@ y , which id@@ enti@@ fied a particular kind of fu@@ el that would nat@@ ur@@ ally gener@@ ate an ou@@ tw@@ ard r@@ ush of space ."
"The fu@@ el is based on something called a quantum field , but the only deta@@ il that mat@@ ters for us is that this fu@@ el pro@@ ves to be so ef@@ fici@@ ent that it &apos;s vir@@ tually im@@ possible to use it all up , which means in the in@@ fl@@ ati@@ on@@ ary theory , the Big Bang giving r@@ ise to our universe is lik@@ ely not a on@@ e-@@ time ev@@ ent ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad the fu@@ el not only gener@@ ated our Big Bang , but it would also gener@@ ate coun@@ t@@ less other Big B@@ an@@ gs , each giving r@@ ise to its own se@@ par@@ ate universe with our universe becom@@ ing but one bub@@ ble in a gr@@ and c@@ os@@ mic bub@@ ble b@@ ath of universes ."
"And now , when we mel@@ d this with string theory , here &apos;s the picture we &apos;re led to ."
E@@ ach of these universes has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a w@@ ide vari@@ ety of different shap@@ es .
The different shap@@ es y@@ i@@ el@@ d different physical fe@@ atures .
"And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it &apos;s only in our universe that the physical fe@@ atures , like the amount of dark energy , are right for our form of life to take hold ."
And this is the comp@@ elling but high@@ ly contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al picture of the w@@ ider c@@ osmo@@ s that c@@ ut@@ t@@ ing@@ -@@ edge observ@@ ation and theory have now led us to seri@@ ously cons@@ ider .
"One big re@@ main@@ ing question , of course , is , could we ever con@@ fir@@ m the ex@@ ist@@ ence of other universes ?"
Well let me descri@@ be one way that might one day happen .
The in@@ fl@@ ati@@ on@@ ary theory already has strong observ@@ ati@@ onal sup@@ port .
"Because the theory predic@@ ts that the Big Bang would have been so int@@ en@@ se that as space ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly exp@@ and@@ ed , tiny quantum j@@ it@@ ters from the mic@@ ro world would have been stre@@ t@@ ched out to the ma@@ c@@ ro world , y@@ i@@ el@@ ding a dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tive f@@ ing@@ er@@ prin@@ t , a pat@@ tern of s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly h@@ ot@@ ter sp@@ ots and s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly col@@ der sp@@ ots , across space , which po@@ wer@@ ful t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ es have now observ@@ ed ."
"@@ Go@@ ing f@@ ur@@ ther , if there are other universes , the theory predic@@ ts that every so of@@ ten those universes can col@@ l@@ ide ."
"And if our universe got h@@ it by another , that col@@ lis@@ ion would gener@@ ate an ad@@ diti@@ onal sub@@ tle pat@@ tern of tem@@ per@@ ature vari@@ ations across space that we might one day be able to det@@ ect ."
"And so ex@@ ot@@ ic as this picture is , it may one day be gro@@ und@@ ed in observ@@ ations , est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing the ex@@ ist@@ ence of other universes ."
I &apos;ll con@@ cl@@ u@@ de with a st@@ ri@@ king im@@ plic@@ ation of all these ideas for the very far future .
"You see , we learned that our universe is not st@@ ati@@ c , that space is exp@@ anding , that that ex@@ pan@@ sion is spe@@ ed@@ ing up and that there might be other universes all by c@@ are@@ fully exam@@ in@@ ing f@@ ain@@ t p@@ in@@ poin@@ ts of star@@ light coming to us from dis@@ tant galaxies ."
"But because the ex@@ pan@@ sion is spe@@ ed@@ ing up , in the very far future , those galaxies will r@@ ush away so far and so fas@@ t that we won &apos;t be able to see them — not because of techn@@ ological lim@@ it@@ ations , but because of the la@@ ws of physics ."
"The light those galaxies em@@ it , even tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing at the fas@@ test spe@@ ed , the spe@@ ed of light , will not be able to over@@ come the ever@@ -@@ w@@ id@@ ening gul@@ f between us ."
"So ast@@ ronom@@ ers in the far future looking out into de@@ ep space will see nothing but an en@@ dl@@ ess stre@@ t@@ ch of st@@ ati@@ c , in@@ k@@ y , black st@@ ill@@ ness ."
And they will con@@ cl@@ u@@ de that the universe is st@@ ati@@ c and un@@ chang@@ ing and popul@@ ated by a single cent@@ ral o@@ as@@ is of matter that they in@@ h@@ ab@@ it — a picture of the c@@ osmo@@ s that we defin@@ it@@ iv@@ ely know to be wrong .
"Now maybe those future ast@@ ronom@@ ers will have rec@@ or@@ ds h@@ and@@ ed down from an ear@@ li@@ er er@@ a , like ours , att@@ es@@ ting to an exp@@ anding c@@ osmo@@ s te@@ em@@ ing with galaxies ."
But would those future ast@@ ronom@@ ers believe such an@@ ci@@ ent kno@@ w@@ l@@ edge ?
"O@@ r would they believe in the black , st@@ ati@@ c emp@@ ty universe that their own stat@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art observ@@ ations re@@ ve@@ al ?"
I sus@@ p@@ ect the l@@ at@@ ter .
Wh@@ ich means that we are liv@@ ing through a re@@ mark@@ ably pr@@ ivil@@ eg@@ ed er@@ a when certain de@@ ep tr@@ u@@ ths about the c@@ osmo@@ s are still within re@@ ach of the human sp@@ ir@@ it of expl@@ or@@ ation .
It ap@@ pe@@ ars that it may not always be that way .
"Because today &apos;s ast@@ ronom@@ ers , by turn@@ ing po@@ wer@@ ful t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ es to the sk@@ y , have cap@@ tu@@ red a h@@ and@@ ful of star@@ k@@ ly informa@@ tive ph@@ ot@@ ons — a kind of c@@ os@@ mic t@@ el@@ eg@@ ram bil@@ lions of years in trans@@ it ."
and the message e@@ cho@@ ing across the ages is c@@ lear .
S@@ ome@@ times nature gu@@ ar@@ ds her sec@@ re@@ ts with the un@@ bre@@ ak@@ able g@@ ri@@ p of physical la@@ w .
S@@ ome@@ times the true nature of reality bec@@ k@@ ons from just be@@ y@@ ond the horiz@@ on .
Thank you very much .

B@@ G : Well it &apos;s hard to say .
"When we learn that ast@@ ronom@@ ers of the far future may not have enough information to fig@@ ure things out , the natural question is , maybe we &apos;re already in that position and certain de@@ ep , c@@ rit@@ ical fe@@ atures of the universe already have es@@ cap@@ ed our abil@@ ity to understand because of how c@@ osmo@@ log@@ y evol@@ ves ."
"So from that per@@ spec@@ tive , maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is ."
"We can understand how to understand the data from the mic@@ ro@@ w@@ ave bac@@ k@@ ground radi@@ ation that was set down 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 7@@ 2 billion years ago — and yet , we can do cal@@ cul@@ ations today to predic@@ t how it will look and it mat@@ ch@@ es ."

"In the year 19@@ 1@@ 9 , a vir@@ tually un@@ known G@@ er@@ man ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ ci@@ an , n@@ amed Th@@ e@@ od@@ or K@@ al@@ uz@@ a su@@ g@@ g@@ es@@ ted a very b@@ old and , in some ways , a very biz@@ ar@@ re idea ."
"That is in ad@@ d@@ ition to left , right , back , for@@ th and up , down , K@@ al@@ uz@@ a pro@@ posed that there might be ad@@ diti@@ onal dimensions of space that for some reason we don &apos;t yet see ."
"Now , when someone makes a b@@ old and biz@@ ar@@ re idea , some@@ times that &apos;s all it is — b@@ old and biz@@ ar@@ re , but it has nothing to do with the world around us ."
"This particular idea , h@@ ow@@ ever — al@@ though we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s right or wrong , and at the end I &apos;ll disc@@ us@@ s experim@@ ents which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it &apos;s right or wrong — this idea has had a ma@@ j@@ or im@@ p@@ act on physics in the last century and contin@@ ues to in@@ form a lot of c@@ ut@@ t@@ ing@@ -@@ edge research ."
"So , I &apos;d like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions ."
So where do we go ?
"This is a year when E@@ instein is bas@@ king in the gl@@ ow of having disc@@ over@@ ed the speci@@ al theory of relati@@ vity and decid@@ es to take on a new project , to try to understand fully the gr@@ and , per@@ v@@ as@@ ive force of gravity ."
"And in that moment , there are many people around who thought that that project had already been res@@ ol@@ ved ."
"@@ Ne@@ w@@ ton had giv@@ en the world a theory of gravity in the l@@ ate 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0s that works well , describ@@ es the mo@@ tion of planets , the mo@@ tion of the moon and so for@@ th , the mo@@ tion of ap@@ oc@@ r@@ y@@ ph@@ al of ap@@ pl@@ es f@@ all@@ ing from tre@@ es , h@@ it@@ ting people on the head ."
A@@ ll of that could be describ@@ ed using Ne@@ w@@ ton &apos;s work .
"But E@@ instein realiz@@ ed that Ne@@ w@@ ton had left something out of the story , because even Ne@@ w@@ ton had writ@@ ten that al@@ though he underst@@ ood how to cal@@ cul@@ ate the ef@@ fect of gravity , he &apos;d been un@@ able to fig@@ ure out how it really works ."
"@@ How is it that the Sun , 9@@ 3 million mil@@ es away , &#91; that &#93; some@@ how it af@@ fec@@ ts the mo@@ tion of the Earth ?"
How does the Sun re@@ ach out across emp@@ ty in@@ ert space and ex@@ ert in@@ flu@@ ence ?
And that is a t@@ ask to which E@@ instein set h@@ im@@ self — to fig@@ ure out how gravity works .
And let me show you what it is that he found .
So E@@ instein found that the medi@@ um that trans@@ m@@ its gravity is space itself .
The idea goes like this : imagine space is a sub@@ stra@@ te of all there is .
"E@@ instein said space is n@@ ice and fl@@ at , if there &apos;s no matter pres@@ ent ."
"But if there is matter in the environ@@ ment , such as the Sun , it c@@ a@@ us@@ es the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space to war@@ p , to cur@@ ve ."
And that commun@@ ic@@ ates the force of gravity .
E@@ v@@ en the Earth war@@ ps space around it .
Now look at the M@@ o@@ on .
"The M@@ o@@ on is ke@@ p@@ t in or@@ bit , acc@@ ord@@ ing to these ideas , because it ro@@ l@@ ls along a val@@ ley in the cur@@ ved environ@@ ment that the Sun and the M@@ o@@ on and the Earth can all create by vir@@ tu@@ e of their pres@@ ence ."
We go to a ful@@ l@@ -@@ fra@@ me view of this .
The Earth itself is ke@@ p@@ t in or@@ bit because it ro@@ l@@ ls along a val@@ ley in the environ@@ ment that &apos;s cur@@ ved because of the Sun &apos;s pres@@ ence .
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works .
"Now , this idea was t@@ es@@ ted in 19@@ 1@@ 9 through ast@@ ronom@@ ical observ@@ ations ."
It really works . It describ@@ es the data .
And this ga@@ ined E@@ instein p@@ rom@@ in@@ ence around the world .
And that is what got K@@ al@@ uz@@ a thinking .
"He , like E@@ instein , was in se@@ arch of what we call a uni@@ fied theory ."
"That &apos;s one theory that might be able to descri@@ be all of nature &apos;s for@@ ces from one set of ideas , one set of princi@@ pl@@ es , one ma@@ st@@ er equ@@ ation , if you will ."
"So K@@ al@@ uz@@ a said to h@@ im@@ self , E@@ instein has been able to descri@@ be gravity in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in space — in fact , space and time , to be more prec@@ ise ."
"You know , the force responsi@@ ble for elec@@ tric@@ ity and magnetic at@@ trac@@ tion and so for@@ th ."
"So K@@ al@@ uz@@ a says , maybe I can pl@@ ay the same game and descri@@ be elec@@ tro@@ magnetic force in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves ."
That ra@@ ised a question : war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in what ?
"E@@ instein had already used up space and time , war@@ ps and cur@@ ves , to descri@@ be gravity ."
There didn &apos;t seem to be anything else to war@@ p or cur@@ ve .
"So K@@ al@@ uz@@ a said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space ."
"He said , if I want to descri@@ be one more force , maybe I need one more dimen@@ sion ."
"And when he looked at that equ@@ ation , it was n@@ one other than the equ@@ ation that scient@@ ists had long known to descri@@ be the elec@@ tro@@ magnetic force ."
A@@ maz@@ ing — it just po@@ pped out .
"He was so exc@@ ited by this realiz@@ ation that he ra@@ n around his h@@ ou@@ se scre@@ am@@ ing , &quot; &quot; V@@ ic@@ t@@ ory ! &quot; &quot; — that he had found the uni@@ fied theory ."
"Now c@@ lear@@ ly , K@@ al@@ uz@@ a was a man who took theory very seri@@ ously ."
"He , in fact — there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to s@@ w@@ im , he read a bo@@ ok , a treat@@ ise on s@@ w@@ im@@ ming — ( Laughter ) — then d@@ ove into the oc@@ e@@ an ."
This is a man who would ris@@ k his life on theory .
"Now , but for those of us who are a little bit more pra@@ c@@ tically min@@ ded , two questions im@@ medi@@ ately ar@@ ise from his observ@@ ation ."
"@@ N@@ umb@@ er one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ?"
We don &apos;t seem to see them .
"And number two : does this theory really work in deta@@ il , when you try to ap@@ ply it to the world around us ?"
"Now , the first question was ans@@ wer@@ ed in 19@@ 2@@ 6 by a f@@ ell@@ ow n@@ amed O@@ sk@@ ar K@@ le@@ in ."
"So , imagine you &apos;re looking at something like a c@@ able sup@@ por@@ ting a t@@ raf@@ f@@ ic light ."
"It &apos;s in M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ tan . You &apos;re in C@@ ent@@ ral P@@ ar@@ k — it &apos;s kind of ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant — but the c@@ able looks on@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal from a dis@@ tant vie@@ w@@ point , but you and I all know that it does have some th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness ."
"It &apos;s very hard to see it , though , from far away ."
"But if we zo@@ om in and take the per@@ spec@@ tive of , say , a little ant walking around — little an@@ ts are so small that they can acc@@ ess all of the dimensions — the long dimen@@ sion , but also this c@@ loc@@ k@@ w@@ ise , coun@@ ter@@ -@@ c@@ loc@@ k@@ w@@ ise direc@@ tion ."
And I hop@@ e you app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate this .
It took so long to get these an@@ ts to do this .
"( Laughter ) But this ill@@ u@@ stra@@ t@@ es the fact that dimensions can be of two sor@@ ts : big and small . And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can eas@@ ily see , but there might be ad@@ diti@@ onal dimensions cur@@ led up , sort of like the cir@@ cul@@ ar part of that c@@ able , so small that they have so far re@@ main@@ ed inv@@ is@@ ible ."
Let me show you what that would look like .
"S@@ ome of you gu@@ ys will fi@@ x that one day , but anything that &apos;s not fl@@ at on a scre@@ en is a new dimen@@ sion , goes sm@@ all@@ er , sm@@ all@@ er , sm@@ all@@ er , and way down in the mic@@ ro@@ s@@ cop@@ ic dep@@ ths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have ad@@ diti@@ onal cur@@ led up dimensions — here is a little shape of a cir@@ cle — so small that we don &apos;t see them ."
"But if you were a little ul@@ t@@ ra mic@@ ro@@ s@@ cop@@ ic ant walking around , you could wal@@ k in the big dimensions that we all know about — that &apos;s like the g@@ ri@@ d part — but you could also acc@@ ess the tiny cur@@ l@@ ed@@ -@@ up dimen@@ sion that &apos;s so small that we can &apos;t see it with the nak@@ ed ey@@ e or even with any of our most re@@ fin@@ ed equ@@ ip@@ ment ."
"But de@@ e@@ ply t@@ uc@@ ked into the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimensions , as we see there ."
But what about the second question that I asked : does the theory actually work when you try to ap@@ ply it to the real world ?
"Well , it turns out that E@@ instein and K@@ al@@ uz@@ a and many others worked on trying to re@@ fin@@ e this fra@@ me@@ work and ap@@ ply it to the physics of the universe as was underst@@ ood at the time , and , in deta@@ il , it didn &apos;t work ."
"In deta@@ il , for inst@@ ance , they c@@ ouldn &apos;t get the mas@@ s of the elec@@ tro@@ n to work out cor@@ rec@@ tly in this theory ."
"So many people worked on it , but by the &apos; 4@@ 0s , cert@@ ain@@ ly by the &apos; 5@@ 0s , this strange but very comp@@ elling idea of how to un@@ if@@ y the la@@ ws of physics had g@@ one away ."
Un@@ til something wonderful happened in our age .
"In our er@@ a , a new approach to un@@ if@@ y the la@@ ws of physics is being pur@@ su@@ ed by physic@@ ists such as myself , many others around the world , it &apos;s called super@@ string theory , as you were ind@@ ic@@ ating ."
"And the wonderful thing is that super@@ string theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study super@@ string theory , we find that it resur@@ rec@@ ts the idea in a sp@@ ar@@ kl@@ ing , new form ."
"So , let me just tell you how that goes ."
Su@@ per@@ string theory — what is it ?
"Well , it &apos;s a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the bas@@ ic , fundam@@ ental , ind@@ iv@@ is@@ ible , un@@ c@@ ut@@ table con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ents making up everything in the world around us ?"
The idea is like this .
"So , imagine we look at a famil@@ i@@ ar ob@@ ject , just a c@@ and@@ le in a hol@@ der , and imagine that we want to fig@@ ure out what it is made of ."
So we go on a jour@@ ney de@@ ep inside the ob@@ ject and exam@@ ine the con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ents .
"So de@@ ep inside — we all know , you go suf@@ fici@@ ently far down , you have atoms ."
We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story .
They have little elec@@ t@@ rons that s@@ war@@ m around a cent@@ ral n@@ uc@@ le@@ us with ne@@ ut@@ rons and pro@@ t@@ ons .
E@@ v@@ en the ne@@ ut@@ rons and pro@@ t@@ ons have sm@@ all@@ er particles inside of them known as qu@@ ar@@ ks .
That is where con@@ ven@@ tional ideas stop .
Here is the new idea of string theory .
"D@@ e@@ ep inside any of these particles , there is something else ."
This something else is this dan@@ c@@ ing fil@@ am@@ ent of energy .
"It looks like a vibra@@ ting string — that &apos;s where the idea , string theory comes from ."
"And just like the vibra@@ ting str@@ ings that you just saw in a c@@ ell@@ o can vibra@@ te in different pat@@ ter@@ n@@ s , these can also vibra@@ te in different pat@@ ter@@ n@@ s ."
They don &apos;t produce different mus@@ ical not@@ es .
"@@ R@@ a@@ ther , they produce the different particles making up the world around us ."
"So if these ideas are cor@@ rec@@ t , this is what the ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mic@@ ro@@ s@@ cop@@ ic l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of the universe looks like ."
"It &apos;s built up of a hu@@ ge number of these little tiny fil@@ am@@ ents of vibra@@ ting energy , vibra@@ ting in different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
The different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ ci@@ es produce the different particles .
The different particles are responsi@@ ble for all the ri@@ chn@@ ess in the world around us .
"And there you see uni@@ fic@@ ation , because matter particles , elec@@ t@@ rons and qu@@ ar@@ ks , radi@@ ation particles , ph@@ ot@@ ons , grav@@ it@@ ons , are all built up from one ent@@ ity ."
So matter and the for@@ ces of nature all are put together under the r@@ ub@@ ri@@ c of vibra@@ ting str@@ ings .
And that &apos;s what we mean by a uni@@ fied theory .
Now here is the cat@@ ch .
"When you study the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics of string theory , you find that it doesn &apos;t work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space ."
"It doesn &apos;t work in a universe with four dimensions of space , n@@ or five , n@@ or six ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , you can study the equ@@ ations , and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimen@@ sion of time ."
"It lead@@ s us right back to this idea of K@@ al@@ uz@@ a and K@@ le@@ in — that our world , when appro@@ pri@@ ately describ@@ ed , has more dimensions than the ones that we see ."
"Now you might think about that and say , well , O@@ K , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they &apos;re really ti@@ gh@@ tly cur@@ led up , ye@@ ah , perhaps we won &apos;t see them , if they &apos;re small enough ."
"But if there &apos;s a little tiny civiliz@@ ation of gre@@ en people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them e@@ i@@ ther . That is true ."
"One of the other predic@@ tions of string theory — no , that &apos;s not one of the other predic@@ tions of string theory ."
"( Laughter ) But it ra@@ is@@ es the question : are we just trying to h@@ ide away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?"
"In the re@@ main@@ ing time , I &apos;d like to tell you two fe@@ atures of them ."
"F@@ irst is , many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the de@@ e@@ p@@ est question in the@@ or@@ e@@ tical physics , the@@ or@@ e@@ tical science ."
"And that question is this : when we look around the world , as scient@@ ists have done for the last hundred years , there ap@@ pe@@ ar to be about 20 numbers that really descri@@ be our universe ."
"Th@@ ese are numbers like the mas@@ s of the particles , like elec@@ t@@ rons and qu@@ ar@@ ks , the str@@ en@@ g@@ th of gravity , the str@@ en@@ g@@ th of the elec@@ tro@@ magnetic force — a l@@ ist of about 20 numbers that have been meas@@ ured with incredible prec@@ is@@ ion , but nob@@ ody has an ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the numbers have the particular val@@ ues that they do ."
"Now , does string theory of@@ fer an answer ?"
Not yet .
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the val@@ ues they do may r@@ ely on the form of the extra dimensions .
"And the wonderful thing is , if those numbers had any other val@@ ues than the known ones , the universe , as we know it , wouldn &apos;t ex@@ ist ."
This is a de@@ ep question .
"Wh@@ y are those numbers so fin@@ ely tun@@ ed to allow stars to sh@@ ine and planets to form , when we recogni@@ ze that if you f@@ id@@ dle with those numbers — if I had 20 di@@ als up here and I let you come up and f@@ id@@ dle with those numbers , almost any f@@ id@@ dl@@ ing makes the universe di@@ sa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar ."
So can we explain those 20 numbers ?
And string theory su@@ g@@ g@@ es@@ ts that those 20 numbers have to do with the extra dimensions .
Let me show you how .
"So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory , it &apos;s not one extra dimen@@ sion , as in the ol@@ der ideas of K@@ al@@ uz@@ a and K@@ le@@ in ."
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions .
"They have a very rich , int@@ ert@@ w@@ ined ge@@ ome@@ try ."
This is an example of something known as a C@@ al@@ ab@@ i@@ -@@ Y@@ a@@ u shape — na@@ me isn &apos;t all that important .
"But , as you can see , the extra dimensions f@@ old in on themselves and int@@ ert@@ w@@ ine in a very interesting shape , interesting struc@@ ture ."
"And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like , then the mic@@ ro@@ s@@ cop@@ ic l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of our universe all around us would look like this on the tin@@ i@@ est of sc@@ al@@ es ."
"When you s@@ wing your hand , you &apos;d be mov@@ ing around these extra dimensions over and over again , but they &apos;re so small that we wouldn &apos;t know it ."
"So what is the physical im@@ plic@@ ation , though , rel@@ ev@@ ant to those 20 numbers ?"
"C@@ on@@ s@@ ider this . I@@ f you look at the in@@ str@@ ument , a F@@ r@@ en@@ ch hor@@ n , not@@ ice that the vibra@@ tions of the air@@ stre@@ ams are af@@ fec@@ ted by the shape of the in@@ str@@ ument ."
"Now in string theory , all the numbers are re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tions of the way str@@ ings can vibra@@ te ."
"So just as those air@@ stre@@ ams are af@@ fec@@ ted by the tw@@ ists and turns in the in@@ str@@ ument , str@@ ings themselves will be af@@ fec@@ ted by the vibra@@ tional pat@@ ter@@ n@@ s in the ge@@ ome@@ try within which they are mov@@ ing ."
So let me bring some str@@ ings into the story .
"And if you watch these little f@@ el@@ lo@@ ws vibra@@ ting around — they &apos;ll be there in a second — right there , not@@ ice that they way they vibra@@ te is af@@ fec@@ ted by the ge@@ ome@@ try of the extra dimensions ."
"So , if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like — we don &apos;t yet , but if we did — we should be able to cal@@ cul@@ ate the allowed not@@ es , the allowed vibra@@ tional pat@@ ter@@ n@@ s ."
"And if we could cal@@ cul@@ ate the allowed vibra@@ tional pat@@ ter@@ n@@ s , we should be able to cal@@ cul@@ ate those 20 numbers ."
"And if the answer that we get from our cal@@ cul@@ ations ag@@ re@@ es with the val@@ ues of those numbers that have been de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed through deta@@ il@@ ed and prec@@ ise experim@@ ent@@ ation , this in many ways would be the first fundam@@ ental ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the struc@@ ture of the universe is the way it is ."
"Now , the second issue that I want to fin@@ ish up with is : how might we test for these extra dimensions more direc@@ tly ?"
"It &apos;s a machine that will sen@@ d particles around a tun@@ ne@@ l , op@@ pos@@ ite direc@@ tions , ne@@ ar the spe@@ ed of light ."
"E@@ very so of@@ ten those particles will be a@@ im@@ ed at each other , so there &apos;s a he@@ ad@@ -@@ on col@@ lis@@ ion ."
"The hop@@ e is that if the col@@ lis@@ ion has enough energy , it may e@@ ject some of the deb@@ ris from the col@@ lis@@ ion from our dimensions , for@@ c@@ ing it to en@@ ter into the other dimensions ."
How would we know it ?
"Well , we &apos;ll measure the amount of energy after the col@@ lis@@ ion , comp@@ are it to the amount of energy before , and if there &apos;s less energy after the col@@ lis@@ ion than before , this will be evidence that the energy has d@@ ri@@ f@@ ted away ."
"And if it d@@ ri@@ f@@ ts away in the right pat@@ tern that we can cal@@ cul@@ ate , this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there ."
Let me show you that idea vis@@ ually .
"So , imagine we have a certain kind of partic@@ le called a grav@@ it@@ on — that &apos;s the kind of deb@@ ris we exp@@ ect to be e@@ jec@@ ted out , if the extra dimensions are real ."
But here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
You take these particles . You sl@@ am them together .
"You sl@@ am them together , and if we are right , some of the energy of that col@@ lis@@ ion will go into deb@@ ris that fli@@ es off into these extra dimensions ."
"So this is the kind of experiment that we &apos;ll be looking at in the next five , seven to 10 years or so ."
"And if this experiment be@@ ars f@@ ru@@ it , if we see that kind of partic@@ le e@@ jec@@ ted by not@@ ic@@ ing that there &apos;s less energy in our dimensions than when we be@@ gan , this will show that the extra dimensions are real ."
"E@@ instein comes along and says , well , space and time can war@@ p and cur@@ ve — that &apos;s what gravity is ."
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our li@@ fe@@ time .
A@@ maz@@ ing possibil@@ ity .
"E@@ very one of you kno@@ ws that the ra@@ te of change s@@ lo@@ ws over the human lif@@ es@@ p@@ an , that your children seem to change by the min@@ ute but your par@@ ents seem to change by the year ."
But what is the na@@ me of this mag@@ ical point in life where change su@@ d@@ den@@ ly goes from a gal@@ lo@@ p to a cra@@ w@@ l ?
I@@ s it te@@ en@@ age years ? I@@ s it middle age ?
D@@ o@@ es any of this matter ?
They need to be part of the p@@ ack .
"I still remem@@ ber the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 19@@ 60 ."
"I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but I will not use di@@ g@@ ital technology , as I &apos;ve done d@@ uring my first five TE@@ D@@ Tal@@ ks ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I have progres@@ sed , and I am , today , la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing a brand new anal@@ o@@ g teach@@ ing technology that I pic@@ ked up from I@@ K@@ E@@ A : this bo@@ x ."
This bo@@ x cont@@ ains one billion people .
"And our teacher told us that the ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ aliz@@ ed world , 19@@ 60 , had one billion people ."
"In the develop@@ ing world , she said , they had two billion people ."
And they liv@@ ed away then .
There was a big ga@@ p between the one billion in the ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ aliz@@ ed world and the two billion in the develop@@ ing world .
"In the ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ aliz@@ ed world , people were heal@@ thy , educ@@ ated , rich , and they had small famil@@ ies ."
And their as@@ pira@@ tion was to buy a c@@ ar .
"And in 19@@ 60 , all Swed@@ es were sav@@ ing to try to buy a V@@ ol@@ v@@ o like this ."
This was the economic level at which Swed@@ en was .
"But in con@@ tra@@ st to this , in the develop@@ ing world , far away , the as@@ pira@@ tion of the average family there was to have f@@ ood for the day ."
They were sav@@ ing to be able to buy a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es .
There was an en@@ or@@ mo@@ us ga@@ p in the world when I gre@@ w up .
"And this ga@@ p between the W@@ est and the rest has created a min@@ d@@ set of the world , which we still use l@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ tically when we talk about &quot; &quot; the W@@ est &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ing World . &quot; &quot; But the world has changed , and it &apos;s over@@ d@@ ue to up@@ gra@@ de that min@@ d@@ set and that ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y of the world , and to understand it ."
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because since 19@@ 60 what has happened in the world up to 20@@ 10 is that a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing four billion people have been ad@@ ded to the world population ."
Just look how many .
The world population has d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed since I went to school .
"And of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the W@@ est ."
"A lot of comp@@ an@@ ies have happened to grow the econom@@ y , so the W@@ es@@ tern population mov@@ ed over to here ."
And now their as@@ pira@@ tion is not only to have a c@@ ar .
Now they want to have a hol@@ i@@ day on a very re@@ mo@@ te des@@ tin@@ ation and they want to f@@ ly .
So this is where they are today .
"And the most successful of the develop@@ ing countries , they have mov@@ ed on , you know , and they have become emer@@ ging economi@@ es , we call them ."
They are now bu@@ ying c@@ ars .
"And what happened a mon@@ th ago was that the Ch@@ in@@ ese comp@@ any , G@@ e@@ ely , they ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red the V@@ ol@@ v@@ o comp@@ any , and then finally the Swed@@ es underst@@ ood that something big had happened in the world ."
( Laughter ) So there they are .
"And the tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y is that the two billion over here that is str@@ ug@@ gl@@ ing for f@@ ood and sho@@ es , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago ."
"The new thing is that we have the big@@ gest p@@ ile of bil@@ lions , the three bil@@ lions here , which are also becom@@ ing emer@@ ging economi@@ es , because they are quite heal@@ thy , relati@@ vely well-@@ educ@@ ated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; ri@@ ch@@ er also &#93; have ."
"And their as@@ pira@@ tion now is , of course , to buy a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle , and then later on they would like to have a mo@@ t@@ or@@ b@@ ik@@ e also ."
"But this is the world we have today , no longer any ga@@ p ."
"But the dis@@ tan@@ ce from the poor@@ est here , the very poor@@ est , to the very ri@@ ch@@ est over here is w@@ ider than ever ."
"But there is a contin@@ u@@ ous world from walking , b@@ ik@@ ing , driv@@ ing , fl@@ ying — there are people on all lev@@ els , and most people t@@ end to be some@@ where in the middle ."
This is the new world we have today in 20@@ 10 .
And what will happen in the future ?
"Well , I &apos;m going to project into 20@@ 50 ."
"I was in S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai rec@@ ently , and I l@@ ist@@ en@@ ed to what &apos;s happening in China , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will cat@@ ch up , just as Japan did ."
A@@ ll the pro@@ jec@@ tions &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
"@@ &#91; But this second &#93; gro@@ ws with seven , eight percent , and then they will end up here ."
They will start fl@@ ying .
"And these lower or middle income countries , the emer@@ ging income countries , they will also for@@ ge for@@ wards econom@@ ically ."
"And if , but only if , we inv@@ est in the right gre@@ en technology — so that we can av@@ o@@ id s@@ ev@@ ere cli@@ mate change , and energy can still be relati@@ vely che@@ a@@ p — then they will move all the way up here ."
And they will start to buy elec@@ tri@@ c c@@ ars .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poor@@ est two billion ?
What about the poor@@ est two billion here ?
W@@ ill they move on ?
"Well , here population &#91; growth &#93; comes in because there &#91; amo@@ n@@ g emer@@ ging economi@@ es &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family plan@@ ning is w@@ id@@ ely used , and population growth is coming to an end ."
"@@ Here &#91; amo@@ n@@ g the poor@@ est &#93; , population is gro@@ wing ."
"So these &#91; poor@@ est &#93; two billion will , in the next dec@@ ad@@ es , increase to three billion , and they will ther@@ e@@ after increase to four billion ."
There is nothing — but a n@@ uc@@ lear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
"But if , and only if , &#91; the poor@@ est &#93; get out of pov@@ erty , they get education , they get impro@@ ved child surviv@@ al , they can buy a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle and a cell ph@@ one and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population growth will stop in 20@@ 50 ."
We cannot have people on this level looking for f@@ ood and sho@@ es because then we get contin@@ u@@ ed population growth .
And let me show you why by con@@ v@@ ert@@ ing back to the ol@@ d@@ -@@ time di@@ g@@ ital technology .
Here I have on the scre@@ en my country bub@@ bl@@ es .
E@@ very bub@@ ble is a country . The si@@ ze is population .
The col@@ ors show the contin@@ ent .
The y@@ ell@@ ow on there is the Americ@@ as ; dark bl@@ ue is A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a ; bro@@ wn is Eu@@ rop@@ e ; gre@@ en is the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast and this light bl@@ ue is S@@ ou@@ th A@@ s@@ ia .
That &apos;s India and this is China . S@@ ize is population .
"@@ Here I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children — big famil@@ ies , small famil@@ ies ."
The year is 19@@ 60 .
"And down here , child surviv@@ al , the per@@ cent@@ age of children surviv@@ ing chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood up to star@@ ting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 8@@ 0 percent , 9@@ 0 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the we@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ est and heal@@ th@@ i@@ est countries ."
"But look , this is the world my teacher tal@@ ked about in 19@@ 60 : one billion W@@ es@@ tern world here — high chil@@ d@@ -@@ surviv@@ al , small famil@@ ies — and all the rest , the ra@@ in@@ b@@ ow of develop@@ ing countries , with very large famil@@ ies and poor child surviv@@ al ."
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
"C@@ an you see , as the years pas@@ s by , child surviv@@ al is increas@@ ing ?"
"They get so@@ a@@ p , hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , education , v@@ acc@@ in@@ ation , pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in and then family plan@@ ning . F@@ am@@ ily si@@ ze is de@@ cre@@ as@@ ing ."
"@@ &#91; Wh@@ en &#93; they get up to 9@@ 0-@@ percent child surviv@@ al , then famil@@ ies de@@ cre@@ ase , and most of the A@@ ra@@ b countries in the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast is f@@ all@@ ing down there &#91; to small famil@@ ies &#93; ."
"@@ L@@ ook , B@@ an@@ gl@@ ad@@ esh cat@@ ch@@ ing up with India ."
"The whole emer@@ ging world jo@@ ins the W@@ es@@ tern world with good child surviv@@ al and small family si@@ ze , but we still have the poor@@ est billion ."
"C@@ an you see the poor@@ est billion , those &#91; two &#93; bo@@ x@@ es I had over here ?"
They are still up here .
"And they still have a child surviv@@ al of only 70 to 8@@ 0 percent , me@@ an@@ ing that if you have six children born , there will be at le@@ ast four who surv@@ ive to the next gener@@ ation ."
And the population will d@@ ou@@ ble in one gener@@ ation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to contin@@ ue to impro@@ ve child surviv@@ al to 9@@ 0 percent .
"That &apos;s why inv@@ est@@ ments by G@@ ates F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion , U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F and a@@ id organiz@@ ations , together with national govern@@ ment in the poor@@ est countries , are so good ; because they are actually hel@@ ping us to re@@ ach a su@@ st@@ ain@@ able population si@@ ze of the world ."
We can stop at n@@ ine billion if we do the right things .
Ch@@ il@@ d surviv@@ al is the new gre@@ en .
It &apos;s only by child surviv@@ al that we will stop population growth .
And will it happen ?
"Well , I &apos;m not an op@@ ti@@ mis@@ t , nei@@ ther am I a p@@ es@@ si@@ mis@@ t ."
"I &apos;m a very seri@@ ous &quot; &quot; possibil@@ ist . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a new cat@@ eg@@ ory where we take emo@@ tion ap@@ art , and we just work anal@@ y@@ tically with the world ."
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
"W@@ it@@ h gre@@ en technology and with inv@@ est@@ ments to all@@ ev@@ i@@ ate pov@@ erty , and global govern@@ ance , the world can become like this ."
And look at the position of the old W@@ est .
"@@ R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber when this bl@@ ue bo@@ x was all alone , lead@@ ing the world , liv@@ ing its own life ."
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
"The ro@@ le of the old W@@ est in the new world is to become the f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion of the modern world — nothing more , nothing less ."
But it &apos;s a very important ro@@ le .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
S@@ up@@ pose that two American friends are tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing together in I@@ tal@@ y .
"The second guy — we &apos;ll call him B@@ ill — is trans@@ fi@@ x@@ ed by em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ ment , at star@@ ing at the thing there in the center ."
"So here &apos;s my question for you : which one of these two gu@@ ys was more lik@@ ely to have v@@ ot@@ ed for G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ ush , which for A@@ l G@@ ore ?"
"And in this case , the st@@ ere@@ ot@@ yp@@ e cor@@ respon@@ ds to reality ."
It really is a fact that liber@@ als are much high@@ er than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves on a ma@@ j@@ or person@@ ality tra@@ it called op@@ en@@ ness to experience .
"@@ People low on it like things that are famil@@ i@@ ar , that are sa@@ fe and de@@ pen@@ da@@ ble ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you understand this tra@@ it , you can understand why any@@ body would e@@ at at Ap@@ pl@@ eb@@ e@@ e &apos;s , but not any@@ body that you know ."
( Laughter ) This tra@@ it also t@@ ells us a lot about polit@@ ics .
This tra@@ it also t@@ ells us a lot about the kinds of groups people jo@@ in .
So here &apos;s the descri@@ p@@ tion of a group I found on the W@@ eb .
Let &apos;s find out .
"I &apos;m going to ask you to ra@@ ise your hand , whether you are liber@@ al , left of center — on social issu@@ es , we &apos;re talking about , pri@@ mar@@ ily — or con@@ serv@@ ative , and I &apos;ll give a th@@ ir@@ d op@@ tion , because I know there are a number of li@@ b@@ ert@@ ari@@ ans in the audi@@ ence ."
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand high right now . O@@ K .
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re li@@ b@@ ert@@ arian .
"O@@ K , about a — two do@@ z@@ en ."
And pl@@ ease ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;d say you are right of center or con@@ serv@@ ative .
O@@ K . This is a bit of a problem .
"Because if our go@@ al is to understand the world , to see@@ k a de@@ e@@ per understanding of the world , our gener@@ al l@@ ack of moral d@@ iver@@ s@@ ity here is going to make it har@@ der ."
"Because when people all share val@@ ues , when people all share moral@@ s , they become a te@@ am , and once you en@@ ga@@ ge the psych@@ ology of te@@ ams , it sh@@ ut@@ s down op@@ en@@ -@@ min@@ ded thinking ."
"When the liber@@ al te@@ am l@@ os@@ es , as it did in 200@@ 4 , and as it almost did in 2@@ 000 , we com@@ for@@ t ourselves ."
( Laughter ) We try to explain why half of America v@@ ot@@ ed for the other te@@ am .
"We think they must be bl@@ ind@@ ed by relig@@ ion , or by simple st@@ up@@ id@@ ity ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , if you think that half of America v@@ ot@@ es R@@ e@@ publ@@ ic@@ an because they are bl@@ ind@@ ed in this way , then my message to you is that you &apos;re tra@@ pped in a moral mat@@ ri@@ x , in a particular moral mat@@ ri@@ x ."
"I was going to ask you which one you pic@@ ked , but no need ."
Let &apos;s study some moral psych@@ ology and see where it takes us .
What is moral@@ ity and where does it come from ?
The wor@@ st idea in all of psych@@ ology is the idea that the mind is a bl@@ ank sl@@ ate at bir@@ th .
"He says , &quot; &quot; The in@@ iti@@ al organiz@@ ation of the brain does not dep@@ end that much on experience ."
It giv@@ es us very strong feel@@ ings about those who cause har@@ m .
This moral f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion under@@ lies about 70 percent of the moral stat@@ ements I &apos;ve heard here at TE@@ D .
The th@@ ir@@ d f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion is in@@ -@@ group / lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty .
You do find groups in the an@@ ima@@ l k@@ ing@@ dom — you do find co@@ oper@@ ative groups — but these groups are always e@@ i@@ ther very small or they &apos;re all si@@ bl@@ ings .
"It &apos;s only amo@@ n@@ g hum@@ ans that you find very large groups of people who are able to co@@ oper@@ ate , jo@@ in together into groups , but in this case , groups that are un@@ ited to fi@@ ght other groups ."
"This probably comes from our long history of trib@@ al liv@@ ing , of trib@@ al psych@@ ology ."
( Laughter ) S@@ por@@ ts is to war as por@@ n@@ og@@ ra@@ ph@@ y is to sex .
"We get to ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise some an@@ ci@@ ent , an@@ ci@@ ent driv@@ es ."
The f@@ our@@ th f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion is au@@ th@@ or@@ ity / re@@ sp@@ ect .
Here you see sub@@ mis@@ sive g@@ est@@ ures from two mem@@ b@@ ers of very cl@@ os@@ ely rel@@ ated spec@@ ies .
"It &apos;s based on more vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary de@@ fer@@ ence , and even el@@ ements of love , at times ."
The fi@@ f@@ th f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion is pur@@ ity / san@@ c@@ t@@ ity .
"This pain@@ ting is called &quot; &quot; The Al@@ le@@ g@@ ory O@@ f Ch@@ ast@@ ity , &quot; &quot; but pur@@ ity &apos;s not just about sup@@ pres@@ sing f@@ em@@ ale s@@ ex@@ u@@ ality ."
"And so far , 3@@ 0,000 people have taken this ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire , and you can too ."
Here are the results .
"@@ Here are the results from about 2@@ 3@@ ,000 American c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens ."
"They give high end@@ or@@ s@@ ement of these sor@@ ts of stat@@ ements all across the bo@@ ard , but as you also see , liber@@ als care about it a little more than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves — the line s@@ lo@@ p@@ es down ."
We find this in every country we look at .
I &apos;ll just fli@@ p through a few other sl@@ id@@ es .
"@@ N@@ ot@@ ice also that on all of these gra@@ ph@@ s , the s@@ lo@@ p@@ e is ste@@ e@@ per on in@@ -@@ group , au@@ th@@ or@@ ity , pur@@ ity ."
"Wh@@ ich sho@@ ws that within any country , the di@@ sa@@ gre@@ ement isn &apos;t over har@@ m and fa@@ ir@@ ness ."
What makes them moral ?
"In the first pan@@ el , we see the moment of cre@@ ation ."
"A@@ ll is ord@@ er@@ ed , all is beautiful , all the people and an@@ im@@ als are doing what they &apos;re sup@@ posed to be doing , where they &apos;re sup@@ posed to be ."
"But then , giv@@ en the way of the world , things change ."
"We get every person doing wh@@ at@@ ever he wan@@ ts , with every ap@@ ert@@ ure of every other person and every other an@@ ima@@ l ."
S@@ ome of you might recogni@@ ze this as the &apos; 6@@ 0s .
"( Laughter ) But the &apos; 6@@ 0s in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably giv@@ es way to the &apos; 7@@ 0s , where the c@@ ut@@ t@@ ings of the ap@@ ert@@ ures h@@ ur@@ t a little bit more ."
"O@@ f course , B@@ os@@ ch called this h@@ ell ."
"So this tri@@ p@@ t@@ y@@ ch , these three pan@@ els por@@ tra@@ y the tim@@ el@@ ess tr@@ uth that order t@@ ends to dec@@ ay ."
The tr@@ uth of social entropy .
"O@@ n the first ro@@ und , people give about half of the money that they can ."
"But they quickly see , &quot; &quot; You know what , other people ar@@ en &apos;t doing so much though ."
"I don &apos;t want to be a suc@@ k@@ er . I &apos;m not going to co@@ oper@@ ate . &quot; &quot; And so co@@ oper@@ ation quickly dec@@ a@@ ys from reas@@ on@@ ably good , down to cl@@ ose to z@@ ero ."
"But then — and here &apos;s the tric@@ k — F@@ e@@ h@@ r and G@@ ach@@ ter said , on the s@@ ev@@ ent@@ h ro@@ und , they told people , &quot; &quot; You know what ? New rul@@ e ."
Because I think that the gre@@ at@@ est won@@ der in the world is not the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on .
The G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on is really simple .
"It &apos;s just a lot of ro@@ c@@ k , and then a lot of water and w@@ ind , and a lot of time , and you get the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on ."
It &apos;s not that compl@@ ic@@ ated .
"This is an absol@@ ute mi@@ ra@@ cle , much har@@ der to explain than the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on ."
And now we get to the c@@ ru@@ x of the di@@ sa@@ gre@@ ement between liber@@ als and con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves .
This is the great in@@ sight that all the A@@ si@@ an religi@@ ons have att@@ ained .
Th@@ ink about y@@ in and y@@ ang .
You find the same thing in H@@ ind@@ u@@ ism .
There are many high g@@ od@@ s in H@@ ind@@ u@@ ism .
"T@@ w@@ o of them are V@@ ishn@@ u , the pres@@ er@@ ver , and S@@ h@@ iv@@ a , the des@@ tro@@ y@@ er ."
This imag@@ e actually is both of those g@@ od@@ s shar@@ ing the same body .
"You have the mark@@ ings of V@@ ishn@@ u on the left , so we could think of V@@ ishn@@ u as the con@@ serv@@ ative g@@ od ."
"You have the mark@@ ings of S@@ h@@ iv@@ a on the right , S@@ h@@ iv@@ a &apos;s the liber@@ al g@@ od . And they work together ."
"Th@@ ese two stan@@ z@@ as con@@ tain , I think , the de@@ e@@ p@@ est in@@ si@@ ghts that have ever been att@@ ained into moral psych@@ ology ."
"F@@ rom the Z@@ en ma@@ st@@ er S@@ en@@ g@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an : &quot; &quot; I@@ f you want the tr@@ uth to st@@ and c@@ lear before you , never be for or against ."
"The str@@ ug@@ g@@ le between for and against is the mind &apos;s wor@@ st disease . &quot; &quot; Now un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it &apos;s a disease that has been c@@ au@@ ght by many of the world &apos;s lead@@ ers ."
"But before you feel super@@ ior to G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ ush , before you th@@ row a st@@ one , ask yourself , do you ac@@ cept this ?"
Do you ac@@ cept ste@@ p@@ ping out of the b@@ at@@ tle of good and ev@@ il ?
Can you be not for or against anything ?
"So , what &apos;s the point ? What should you do ?"
So what should you do ? A@@ m I telling you to not str@@ ive ?
"A@@ m I telling you to em@@ bra@@ ce S@@ en@@ g@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an and stop , stop with this str@@ ug@@ g@@ le of for and against ?"
"@@ No , absol@@ ut@@ ely not . I &apos;m not saying that ."
"But as we learned from S@@ am@@ an@@ th@@ a P@@ o@@ wer , in her story about S@@ er@@ gi@@ o V@@ i@@ e@@ ir@@ a de M@@ ell@@ o , you can &apos;t just go ch@@ arg@@ ing in , saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wrong , and I &apos;m right . &quot; &quot; Because , as we just heard , everybody thin@@ ks they are right ."
A lot of the problems we have to sol@@ ve are problems that requ@@ ire us to change other people .
Th@@ ink about the en@@ or@@ mo@@ us moral au@@ th@@ or@@ ity of the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ am@@ a — and it comes from his moral hum@@ il@@ ity .
"So I think the point — the point of my talk , and I think the point of TE@@ D — is that this is a group that is pas@@ sion@@ ately en@@ gag@@ ed in the pur@@ su@@ it of chang@@ ing the world for the better ."
People here are pas@@ sion@@ ately en@@ gag@@ ed in trying to make the world a better place .
But there is also a pas@@ sion@@ ate com@@ mit@@ ment to the tr@@ uth .
And so I think that the answer is to use that pas@@ sion@@ ate com@@ mit@@ ment to the tr@@ uth to try to turn it into a better future for us all .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I@@ s there anything uni@@ qu@@ e about human be@@ ings ?
There is .
We &apos;re the only cre@@ atures with fully developed moral senti@@ ments .
We &apos;re ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with moral@@ ity as social cre@@ atures .
We need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
And I person@@ ally am ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with moral@@ ity .
"It was all d@@ ue to this woman , S@@ is@@ ter M@@ ary Mar@@ ast@@ el@@ a , also known as my mo@@ m ."
"As an al@@ t@@ ar bo@@ y , I bre@@ a@@ th@@ ed in a lot of in@@ cen@@ se , and I learned to say ph@@ ra@@ ses in L@@ ati@@ n , but I also had time to think about whether my mother &apos;s to@@ p@@ -@@ down moral@@ ity app@@ li@@ ed to everybody ."
I saw that people who were religi@@ ous and n@@ on@@ -@@ religi@@ ous were equ@@ ally ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with moral@@ ity .
"I thought , maybe there &apos;s some ear@@ th@@ ly bas@@ is for moral dec@@ is@@ ions ."
But I wanted to go f@@ ur@@ ther than to say our bra@@ ins make us moral .
I want to know if there &apos;s a chem@@ is@@ try of moral@@ ity . I want to know
if there was a moral molecul@@ e .
"A@@ f@@ ter 10 years of experim@@ ents , I found it ."
W@@ ould you like to see it ? I b@@ rou@@ ght some with me .
This little sy@@ r@@ ing@@ e cont@@ ains the moral molecul@@ e .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s called oxytocin .
So oxytocin is a simple and an@@ ci@@ ent molecul@@ e found only in mam@@ m@@ als .
"In ro@@ dents , it was known to make mothers care for their of@@ f@@ sp@@ r@@ ing , and in some cre@@ atures , allowed for t@@ ol@@ er@@ ation of bur@@ ro@@ w@@ mat@@ es ."
"But in hum@@ ans , it was only known to fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate bir@@ th and b@@ reas@@ t@@ fe@@ ed@@ ing in women , and is rel@@ eas@@ ed by both s@@ ex@@ es d@@ uring sex ."
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecul@@ e .
I did what most of us do — I tried it on some colle@@ ag@@ ues .
"One of them told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ a@@ ul , that is the world &apos;s st@@ up@@ id@@ ist idea ."
"It is , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; only a f@@ em@@ ale molecul@@ e ."
"It can &apos;t be that important . &quot; &quot; But I coun@@ tered , &quot; &quot; Well men &apos;s bra@@ ins make this too ."
"There must be a reason why . &quot; &quot; But he was right , it was a st@@ up@@ id idea ."
But it was t@@ est@@ ably st@@ up@@ id .
"In other words , I thought I could des@@ ign an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral ."
T@@ urn@@ s out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
"F@@ irst of all , oxytocin is a sh@@ y molecul@@ e ."
"B@@ as@@ el@@ ine lev@@ els are ne@@ ar z@@ ero , without some s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us to cause its rel@@ ease ."
"And when it &apos;s produc@@ ed , it has a thre@@ e-@@ min@@ ute hal@@ f-@@ life , and de@@ grad@@ es ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly at room tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"So this experiment would have to cause a sur@@ ge of oxytocin , have to gra@@ b it fas@@ t and keep it c@@ old ."
I think I can do that .
"Now l@@ uc@@ k@@ ily , oxytocin is produc@@ ed both in the brain and in the blo@@ od , so I could do this experiment without learning neuro@@ sur@@ g@@ ery ."
Th@@ en I had to measure moral@@ ity .
So tak@@ ing on M@@ or@@ ality with a cap@@ ital M is a hu@@ ge project .
So I started sm@@ all@@ er .
I studi@@ ed one single vir@@ tu@@ e : tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
Why ? I had sho@@ wn in the early 200@@ 0s that countries with a high@@ er pro@@ por@@ tion of tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thy people are more pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous .
"So in these countries , more economic tr@@ an@@ sac@@ tions occ@@ ur and more we@@ al@@ th is created , all@@ ev@@ i@@ ating pov@@ erty ."
So poor countries are by and large low trust countries .
"So if I underst@@ ood the chem@@ is@@ try of tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess , I might help all@@ ev@@ i@@ ate pov@@ erty ."
But I &apos;m also a sk@@ e@@ p@@ tic .
"I don &apos;t want to just ask people , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thy ? &quot; &quot; So instead I use the J@@ er@@ ry M@@ ag@@ u@@ ire approach to research ."
"If you &apos;re so vir@@ tu@@ ous , show me the money ."
So what we do in my la@@ b is we tem@@ p@@ t people with vir@@ tu@@ e and vic@@ e by using money .
Let me show you how we do that .
So we rec@@ ru@@ it some people for an experiment .
They all get $ 10 if they ag@@ ree to show up .
"We give them lots of in@@ struc@@ tion , and we never ever de@@ ce@@ ive them ."
Th@@ en we mat@@ ch them in pa@@ ir@@ s by computer .
"And in that pa@@ ir , one person gets a message saying , &quot; &quot; Do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you ear@@ ned for being here and ship it to someone else in the la@@ b ? &quot; &quot; The tric@@ k is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them ."
You only do it one time .
Now wh@@ at@@ ever you give up gets tri@@ pl@@ ed in the other person &apos;s ac@@ coun@@ t .
You &apos;re going to make them a lot we@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ er .
And they get a message by computer saying person one s@@ ent you this amount of money .
"@@ Do you want to keep it all , or do you want to sen@@ d some amount back ?"
So think about this experiment for min@@ ute .
You &apos;re going to s@@ it on these hard ch@@ air@@ s for an h@@ our and a half .
S@@ ome mad scient@@ ist is going to j@@ a@@ b your ar@@ m with a need@@ le and take four t@@ ub@@ es of blo@@ od .
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stran@@ ger ?
So this was the bir@@ th of v@@ am@@ pir@@ e econom@@ ics .
M@@ ake a dec@@ is@@ ion and give me some blo@@ od .
"So in fact , experim@@ ental econom@@ ists had ru@@ n this test around the world , and for much high@@ er st@@ ak@@ es , and the con@@ sen@@ s@@ us view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust , and the trans@@ fer from the second person back to the first meas@@ ured tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess ."
"But in fact , econom@@ ists were fl@@ um@@ mo@@ x@@ ed on why the second person would ever re@@ turn any money ."
"They as@@ s@@ um@@ ed money is good , why not keep it all ?"
That &apos;s not what we found .
"We found 9@@ 0 percent of the first dec@@ is@@ ion@@ -@@ mak@@ ers s@@ ent money , and of those who re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed money , 9@@ 5 percent re@@ turned some of it ."
But why ?
"Well by meas@@ uring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed , the more their brain produc@@ ed oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on bo@@ ard , the more money they re@@ turned ."
So we have a bi@@ ology of tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
But wa@@ it . What &apos;s wrong with this experiment ?
T@@ w@@ o things .
One is that nothing in the body happens in is@@ ol@@ ation .
"So we meas@@ ured n@@ ine other molecul@@ es that inter@@ act with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any ef@@ fect ."
But the second is that I still only had this in@@ direc@@ t relation@@ ship between oxytocin and tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
I didn &apos;t know for sure oxytocin c@@ a@@ used tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
"So to make the experiment , I knew I &apos;d have to go into the brain and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ate oxytocin direc@@ tly ."
I used everything shor@@ t of a dr@@ ill to get oxytocin into my own brain .
And I found I could do it with a na@@ sa@@ l in@@ hal@@ er .
"So along with colle@@ ag@@ ues in Z@@ ur@@ ich , we put 200 men on oxytocin or plac@@ ebo , had that same trust test with money , and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust , we can more than d@@ ou@@ ble the number of people who s@@ ent all their money to a stran@@ ger — all without al@@ ter@@ ing mo@@ od or c@@ ognition ."
"So oxytocin is the trust molecul@@ e , but is it the moral molecul@@ e ?"
"@@ U@@ sing the oxytocin in@@ hal@@ er , we ra@@ n more studies ."
We showed that oxytocin in@@ f@@ us@@ ion increas@@ es gener@@ os@@ ity in un@@ il@@ at@@ er@@ al mon@@ et@@ ary trans@@ fer@@ s by 8@@ 0 percent .
We showed it increas@@ es don@@ ations to char@@ ity by 50 percent .
We &apos;ve also inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ ted n@@ on@@ -@@ ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ olog@@ ic ways to ra@@ ise oxytocin .
"Th@@ ese in@@ cl@@ u@@ de mas@@ sage , dan@@ c@@ ing and pra@@ ying ."
"@@ Y@@ es , my mo@@ m was happy about that last one ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever we ra@@ ise oxytocin , people w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ly op@@ en up their w@@ all@@ ets and share money with str@@ ang@@ ers ."
But why do they do this ?
What does it feel like when your brain is flo@@ od@@ ed with oxytocin ?
"T@@ o inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ te this question , we ra@@ n an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four ye@@ ar-@@ old son , and his son has ter@@ min@@ al brain can@@ cer ."
"A@@ f@@ ter they wat@@ ched the video , we had them ra@@ te their feel@@ ings and took blo@@ od before and after to measure oxytocin ."
The change in oxytocin predic@@ ted their feel@@ ings of em@@ pa@@ thy .
So it &apos;s em@@ pa@@ thy that makes us con@@ n@@ ect to other people .
It &apos;s em@@ pa@@ thy that makes us help other people .
It &apos;s em@@ pa@@ thy that makes us moral .
Now this idea is not new .
"A then un@@ known ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ er n@@ amed A@@ da@@ m S@@ mit@@ h w@@ ro@@ te a bo@@ ok in 1@@ 7@@ 5@@ 9 called &quot; &quot; The Th@@ e@@ ory of M@@ or@@ al S@@ enti@@ ments . &quot; &quot; In this bo@@ ok , S@@ mit@@ h arg@@ u@@ ed that we are moral cre@@ atures , not because of a to@@ p@@ -@@ down reason , but for a bot@@ t@@ om@@ -@@ up reason ."
"He said we &apos;re social cre@@ atures , so we share the emo@@ tions of others ."
"So if I do something that h@@ ur@@ ts you , I feel that pain ."
So I t@@ end to av@@ o@@ id that .
"If I do something that makes you happy , I get to share your jo@@ y ."
So I t@@ end to do those things .
"Now this is the same A@@ da@@ m S@@ mit@@ h who , 1@@ 7 years later , would w@@ r@@ ite a little bo@@ ok called &quot; &quot; The W@@ e@@ al@@ th of N@@ ations &quot; &quot; — the f@@ ou@@ nd@@ ing doc@@ ument of econom@@ ics ."
"But he was , in fact , a moral ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ er , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral ."
I just found the molecul@@ e be@@ h@@ ind it .
"But kno@@ wing that molecul@@ e is val@@ u@@ able , because it t@@ ells us how to turn up this behav@@ ior and what turns it off ."
"In particular , it t@@ ells us why we see im@@ moral@@ ity ."
"So to inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ te im@@ moral@@ ity , let me bring you back now to 198@@ 0 ."
"I &apos;m working at a ga@@ s st@@ ation on the outs@@ k@@ ir@@ ts of S@@ an@@ ta B@@ ar@@ b@@ ara , C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia ."
"You s@@ it in a ga@@ s st@@ ation all day , you see lots of moral@@ ity and im@@ moral@@ ity , let me tell you ."
"So one S@@ un@@ day af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , a man wal@@ ks into my c@@ a@@ shi@@ er &apos;s bo@@ ot@@ h with this beautiful j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry bo@@ x ."
O@@ p@@ ens it up and there &apos;s a pe@@ ar@@ l nec@@ kl@@ ace inside .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I was in the men &apos;s room ."
"I just found this . What do you think we should do with it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , put it in the lost and found . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; Well this is very val@@ u@@ able .
"We have to find the ow@@ ner for this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re trying to dec@@ ide what to do with this , and the ph@@ one r@@ ings ."
"And a man says very exc@@ it@@ ed@@ ly , &quot; &quot; I was in your ga@@ s st@@ ation a while ago , and I b@@ ou@@ ght this j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry for my wife , and I can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ ear@@ l nec@@ kl@@ ace ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah . &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , a guy just found it . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; O@@ h , you &apos;re sav@@ ing my life . Here &apos;s my ph@@ one number ."
T@@ ell that guy to wa@@ it half an h@@ our .
"I &apos;ll be there and I &apos;ll give him a $ 200 re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; G@@ re@@ at , so I tell the guy , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , rel@@ a@@ x ."
"@@ G@@ et yourself a f@@ at re@@ ward . L@@ i@@ fe &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t do it ."
"I have this job inter@@ view in G@@ al@@ ena in 15 minutes , and I need this job , I &apos;ve got to go . &quot; &quot; A@@ ga@@ in he asked me , &quot; &quot; What do you think we should do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in high school . I have no idea ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll hold it for you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve been so n@@ ice , let &apos;s s@@ pl@@ it the re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll give you the j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry , you give me a hundred dollars , and when the guy comes ... &quot; &quot; You see it . I was con@@ ned ."
"So this is a clas@@ si@@ c c@@ on called the p@@ ig@@ e@@ on drop , and I was the p@@ ig@@ e@@ on ."
"So the way many con@@ s work is not that the con@@ man gets the vic@@ ti@@ m to trust him , it &apos;s that he sho@@ ws he tr@@ ust@@ s the vic@@ ti@@ m ."
Now we know what happens .
"The vic@@ ti@@ m &apos;s brain rel@@ eas@@ es oxytocin , and you &apos;re op@@ ening up your w@@ all@@ et or pur@@ se , giving away the money ."
So who are these people who man@@ i@@ pul@@ ate our oxytocin sy@@ st@@ ems ?
"We found , t@@ es@@ ting thousands of individ@@ u@@ als , that five percent of the population don &apos;t rel@@ ease oxytocin on s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us ."
"So if you trust them , their bra@@ ins don &apos;t rel@@ ease oxytocin ."
"If there &apos;s money on the table , they keep it all ."
So there &apos;s a techn@@ ical word for these people in my la@@ b .
We call them bas@@ t@@ ar@@ ds .
( Laughter ) These are not people you want to have a be@@ er with .
They have many of the at@@ trib@@ utes of psych@@ op@@ a@@ ths .
Now there are other ways the system can be in@@ h@@ ib@@ ited .
One is through impro@@ per n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing .
"So we &apos;ve studi@@ ed s@@ ex@@ ually ab@@ used women , and about half those don &apos;t rel@@ ease oxytocin on s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us ."
You need enough n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing for this system to devel@@ op pro@@ per@@ ly .
"A@@ l@@ so , high st@@ ress in@@ h@@ ib@@ its oxytocin ."
"So we all know this , when we &apos;re really st@@ res@@ sed out , we &apos;re not ac@@ ting our best ."
"There &apos;s another way oxytocin is in@@ h@@ ib@@ ited , which is interesting — through the action of t@@ est@@ os@@ ter@@ one ."
"So we , in experim@@ ents , have ad@@ min@@ is@@ tered t@@ est@@ os@@ ter@@ one to men ."
"And instead of shar@@ ing money , they become sel@@ f@@ ish ."
"But inter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , high t@@ est@@ os@@ ter@@ one mal@@ es are also more lik@@ ely to use their own money to p@@ un@@ ish others for being sel@@ f@@ ish ."
"( Laughter ) Now think about this . It means , within our own bi@@ ology , we have the y@@ in and y@@ ang of moral@@ ity ."
"We have oxytocin that connec@@ ts us to others , makes us feel what they feel ."
And we have t@@ est@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"And men have 10 times the t@@ est@@ os@@ ter@@ one as women , so men do this more than women — we have t@@ est@@ os@@ ter@@ one that makes us want to p@@ un@@ ish people who be@@ have im@@ mor@@ ally ."
We don &apos;t need G@@ od or govern@@ ment telling us what to do .
It &apos;s all inside of us .
"So you may be wonder@@ ing : these are beautiful labor@@ at@@ ory experim@@ ents , do they really ap@@ ply to real life ?"
"@@ Y@@ e@@ ah , I &apos;ve been wor@@ r@@ ying about that too ."
So I &apos;ve g@@ one out of the la@@ b to see if this really hol@@ ds in our da@@ ily lives .
"So last s@@ um@@ m@@ er , I att@@ end@@ ed a wed@@ ding in S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Engl@@ and ."
200 people in this beautiful V@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ ian man@@ sion .
I didn &apos;t know a single person .
And I drove up in my r@@ ent@@ ed V@@ au@@ x@@ h@@ all .
And I took out a cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and dr@@ y ice and need@@ les and t@@ ub@@ es .
And I took blo@@ od from the br@@ ide and the gro@@ om and the wed@@ ding par@@ ty and the family and the friends before and im@@ medi@@ ately after the vo@@ ws .
( Laughter ) And gu@@ ess what ?
"W@@ ed@@ d@@ ings cause a rel@@ ease of oxytocin , but they do so in a very particular way ."
Wh@@ o is the center of the wed@@ ding solar system ?
The br@@ ide .
She had the big@@ gest increase in oxytocin .
Wh@@ o lov@@ es the wed@@ ding almost as much as the br@@ ide ?
"H@@ er mother , that &apos;s right ."
H@@ er mother was number two .
"Th@@ en the gro@@ om &apos;s father , then the gro@@ om , then the family , then the friends — ar@@ ra@@ y@@ ed around the br@@ ide like planets around the Sun ."
"So I think it t@@ ells us that we &apos;ve des@@ ign@@ ed this rit@@ ual to con@@ n@@ ect us to this new couple , con@@ n@@ ect us emo@@ tion@@ ally ."
Why ? Because we need them to be successful at re@@ produc@@ ing to per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ate the spec@@ ies .
I also wor@@ ri@@ ed that my trust experim@@ ents with small amoun@@ ts of money didn &apos;t really cap@@ ture how of@@ ten we actually trust our lives to str@@ ang@@ ers .
"So even though I have a fear of he@@ igh@@ ts , I rec@@ ently stra@@ pped myself to another human being and ste@@ pped out of an air@@ plan@@ e at 1@@ 2@@ ,000 ft ."
"I took my blo@@ od before and after , and I had a hu@@ ge sp@@ ik@@ e of oxytocin ."
And there are so many ways we can con@@ n@@ ect to people .
"For example , through social med@@ ia ."
M@@ any people are T@@ we@@ et@@ ing right now .
So we inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ ted the ro@@ le of social med@@ ia and found the using social med@@ ia produc@@ ed a sol@@ id d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ di@@ g@@ it increase in oxytocin .
So I ra@@ n this experiment rec@@ ently for the K@@ or@@ e@@ an B@@ ro@@ ad@@ c@@ as@@ ting S@@ y@@ stem .
And they had the re@@ por@@ ters and their produc@@ ers parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate .
"And one of these gu@@ ys , he must have been 2@@ 2 , he had 150 percent sp@@ ik@@ e in oxytocin ."
"I mean , ast@@ ou@@ nd@@ ing ; no one has this ."
So he was using social med@@ ia in pr@@ iv@@ ate .
"When I w@@ ro@@ te my re@@ port to the K@@ or@@ e@@ ans , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , I don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot; &quot; but my gu@@ ess was inter@@ ac@@ ting with his mother or his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end ."
They ch@@ ec@@ ked .
He was inter@@ ac@@ ting on his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end &apos;s F@@ ac@@ eb@@ ook p@@ age .
There you go . That &apos;s connec@@ tion .
"So there &apos;s t@@ ons of ways that we can con@@ n@@ ect to other people , and it seems to be univer@@ sa@@ l ."
"T@@ w@@ o weeks ago , I just got back from P@@ ap@@ u@@ a New G@@ u@@ in@@ ea where I went up to the high@@ lan@@ ds — very is@@ ol@@ ated trib@@ es of sub@@ s@@ ist@@ ence far@@ m@@ ers liv@@ ing as they have liv@@ ed for mil@@ l@@ en@@ ia ."
There are 8@@ 00 different langu@@ ages in the high@@ lan@@ ds .
These are the most pri@@ mit@@ ive people in the world .
And they inde@@ ed also rel@@ ease oxytocin .
So oxytocin connec@@ ts us to other people .
O@@ x@@ y@@ tocin makes us feel what other people feel .
And it &apos;s so easy to cause people &apos;s bra@@ ins to rel@@ ease oxytocin .
"I know how to do it , and my fav@@ or@@ ite way to do it is , in fact , the eas@@ i@@ est ."
Let me show it to you .
C@@ ome here . G@@ ive me a hu@@ g .
( Laughter ) There you go .
( Applause ) So my pen@@ ch@@ ant for hu@@ g@@ ging other people has ear@@ ned me the n@@ ic@@ k@@ na@@ me D@@ r@@ . L@@ ove .
"I &apos;m happy to share a little more love in the world , it &apos;s great , but here &apos;s your pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion from D@@ r@@ . L@@ ove : eight hu@@ gs a day ."
We have found that people who rel@@ ease more oxytocin are happ@@ i@@ er .
And they &apos;re happ@@ i@@ er because they have better relation@@ shi@@ ps of all typ@@ es .
D@@ r@@ . L@@ ove says eight hu@@ gs a day .
E@@ ight hu@@ gs a day — you &apos;ll be happ@@ i@@ er and the world will be a better place .
"O@@ f course , if you don &apos;t like to tou@@ ch people , I can always sh@@ ove this up your n@@ ose ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
"When I was n@@ ine years old , I went off to s@@ um@@ m@@ er cam@@ p for the first time ."
C@@ am@@ p was more like a ke@@ g par@@ ty without any al@@ co@@ h@@ ol .
And I just wa@@ ited for the time that I could go off and read my bo@@ o@@ ks .
It &apos;s different from being sh@@ y .
S@@ hy@@ ness is about fear of social j@@ ud@@ g@@ ment .
"We sa@@ t in ro@@ ws of des@@ ks like this , and we did most of our work pretty a@@ ut@@ on@@ o@@ mo@@ us@@ ly ."
"So , quite underst@@ an@@ dab@@ ly , qu@@ al@@ ities like mag@@ n@@ et@@ ism and char@@ is@@ ma su@@ d@@ den@@ ly come to seem really important ."
So now I &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my su@@ it@@ case today .
It &apos;s great for int@@ rov@@ ert@@ s and it &apos;s great for ext@@ rov@@ ert@@ s .
"H@@ i , my na@@ me is Mar@@ cin — far@@ m@@ er , techn@@ olog@@ ist ."
"I was born in P@@ ol@@ and , now in the U.S@@ ."
I started a group called O@@ p@@ en S@@ our@@ ce E@@ c@@ ology .
"We &apos;ve id@@ enti@@ fied the 50 most important ma@@ chin@@ es that we think it takes for modern life to ex@@ ist — things from trac@@ tors , b@@ read ov@@ ens , cir@@ cu@@ it mak@@ ers ."
"Th@@ en we set out to create an op@@ en s@@ our@@ ce , D@@ I@@ Y , do it yourself ver@@ sion that any@@ one can build and main@@ tain at a fra@@ c@@ tion of the cost ."
We call this the G@@ l@@ ob@@ al V@@ ill@@ age Con@@ struc@@ tion S@@ et .
So let me tell you a story .
"So I fin@@ i@@ shed my 20@@ s with a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . in f@@ us@@ ion energy , and I disc@@ over@@ ed I was us@@ el@@ ess ."
I had no pra@@ c@@ tical sk@@ il@@ ls .
"The world pres@@ ent@@ ed me with op@@ tions , and I took them ."
I gu@@ ess you can call it the cons@@ um@@ er lif@@ est@@ y@@ le .
So I started a far@@ m in M@@ is@@ s@@ ou@@ ri and learned about the econom@@ ics of far@@ ming .
I b@@ ou@@ ght a trac@@ tor — then it bro@@ ke .
I pa@@ id to get it re@@ pa@@ i@@ red — then it bro@@ ke again .
"Th@@ en pretty so@@ on , I was bro@@ ke too ."
"I realiz@@ ed that the truly appro@@ pri@@ ate , lo@@ w@@ -@@ cost to@@ ols that I needed to start a su@@ st@@ ain@@ able far@@ m and s@@ et@@ t@@ l@@ ement just didn &apos;t ex@@ ist yet ."
"I needed to@@ ols that were rob@@ ust , mod@@ ul@@ ar , high@@ ly ef@@ fici@@ ent and op@@ ti@@ miz@@ ed , lo@@ w@@ -@@ cost , made from loc@@ al and rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed materi@@ als that would last a li@@ fe@@ time , not des@@ ign@@ ed for ob@@ sol@@ es@@ c@@ ence ."
I found that I would have to build them myself .
So I did just that .
And I t@@ es@@ ted them .
And I found that ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ al produc@@ ti@@ vity can be achi@@ ev@@ ed on a small sc@@ ale .
"So then I published the 3@@ D des@@ ign@@ s , s@@ che@@ ma@@ tics , in@@ struc@@ tional vide@@ os and b@@ ud@@ gets on a w@@ ik@@ i ."
"Th@@ en con@@ trib@@ ut@@ ors from all over the world be@@ gan sho@@ wing up , pro@@ tot@@ yp@@ ing new ma@@ chin@@ es d@@ uring de@@ dic@@ ated project vis@@ its ."
"So far , we have pro@@ tot@@ y@@ ped eight of the 50 ma@@ chin@@ es ."
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own .
We know that op@@ en s@@ our@@ ce has suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed with to@@ ols for man@@ ag@@ ing kno@@ w@@ l@@ edge and cre@@ ati@@ vity .
And the same is star@@ ting to happen with har@@ d@@ w@@ are too .
We &apos;re f@@ oc@@ using on har@@ d@@ w@@ are because it is har@@ d@@ w@@ are that can change people &apos;s lives in such tan@@ g@@ ible material ways .
"If we can lower the bar@@ ri@@ ers to far@@ ming , buil@@ ding , man@@ uf@@ ac@@ tur@@ ing , then we can un@@ le@@ as@@ h just mas@@ sive amoun@@ ts of human p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al ."
That &apos;s not only in the develop@@ ing world .
"O@@ ur to@@ ols are being made for the American far@@ m@@ er , buil@@ der , ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur , mak@@ er ."
"We &apos;ve seen lots of exc@@ it@@ ement from these people , who can now start a con@@ struc@@ tion b@@ usiness , parts man@@ uf@@ ac@@ tur@@ ing , organ@@ ic C@@ S@@ A or just sel@@ l@@ ing power back to the g@@ ri@@ d ."
"O@@ ur go@@ al is a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of published des@@ ign@@ s so c@@ lear , so complet@@ e , that a single b@@ urn@@ ed D@@ V@@ D is ef@@ fec@@ ti@@ vely a civiliz@@ ation star@@ ter k@@ it ."
I &apos;ve plan@@ ted a hundred tre@@ es in a day .
"I &apos;ve pres@@ sed 5@@ ,000 br@@ ic@@ ks in one day from the d@@ ir@@ t ben@@ e@@ ath my fe@@ et and built a trac@@ tor in six days ."
"F@@ rom what I &apos;ve seen , this is only the beginning ."
"If this idea is truly sound , then the im@@ plic@@ ations are sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant ."
"A gre@@ ater dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion of the means of produc@@ tion , environ@@ m@@ ent@@ ally sound sup@@ ply ch@@ ains , and a new@@ ly rel@@ ev@@ ant D@@ I@@ Y mak@@ er culture can hop@@ e to trans@@ c@@ end ar@@ ti@@ fici@@ al sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ity ."
We &apos;re expl@@ or@@ ing the lim@@ its of what we all can do to make a better world with op@@ en har@@ d@@ w@@ are technology .
Thank you .

"A thou@@ s@@ and years later , a mam@@ mo@@ th di@@ ed in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n G@@ er@@ many ."
"A few centur@@ ies after that , a g@@ ri@@ f@@ f@@ on v@@ ul@@ ture also di@@ ed in the same vic@@ in@@ ity ."
"And we know almost nothing about how these an@@ im@@ als met their de@@ a@@ ths , but these different cre@@ atures dis@@ per@@ sed across both time and space did share one re@@ mark@@ able f@@ ate ."
Th@@ ink about that for a second .
"It seems pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous that you would inv@@ ent the fl@@ ute , a to@@ ol that created us@@ el@@ ess vibra@@ tions in air molecul@@ es ."
But that is exactly what our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors did .
Now this turns out to be sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly common in the history of in@@ nov@@ ation .
"But just as of@@ ten , new ideas come into the world simply because they &apos;re fu@@ n ."
T@@ ake what may be the most important inv@@ en@@ tion of modern times : program@@ ma@@ ble comput@@ ers .
"S@@ ome@@ one came up with the br@@ il@@ li@@ ant idea of tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ing s@@ oun@@ ds by pres@@ sing small lev@@ ers with our f@@ ing@@ ers , inv@@ ent@@ ing the first mus@@ ical k@@ ey@@ bo@@ ard ."
"In fact , the very first t@@ y@@ pe@@ writ@@ er was or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally called &quot; &quot; the writ@@ ing har@@ p@@ sich@@ or@@ d . &quot; &quot; F@@ l@@ utes and music led to even more po@@ wer@@ ful bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s ."
"A@@ b@@ out a thou@@ s@@ and years ago , at the he@@ ight of the I@@ sla@@ mic R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ san@@ ce , three bro@@ thers in B@@ agh@@ da@@ d des@@ ign@@ ed a dev@@ ice that was an a@@ ut@@ o@@ mat@@ ed or@@ gan ."
"They called it &quot; &quot; the in@@ str@@ ument that pl@@ a@@ ys itself . &quot; &quot; Now , the in@@ str@@ ument was basically a gi@@ ant music bo@@ x ."
This in@@ str@@ ument was the first of its kind .
It was program@@ ma@@ ble .
"Now , con@@ cep@@ tually , this was a mas@@ sive le@@ a@@ p for@@ ward ."
The whole idea of har@@ d@@ w@@ are and sof@@ tw@@ are becom@@ es thin@@ k@@ able for the first time with this inv@@ en@@ tion .
It came from the strange d@@ eli@@ ght of wat@@ ch@@ ing a machine pl@@ ay music .
"In fact , the idea of program@@ ma@@ ble ma@@ chin@@ es was ex@@ cl@@ us@@ iv@@ ely ke@@ p@@ t al@@ ive by music for about 7@@ 00 years ."
"In the 1@@ 7@@ 0@@ 0s , mus@@ ic@@ -@@ making ma@@ chin@@ es bec@@ ame the play@@ things of the P@@ aris@@ ian el@@ ite ."
"And as de V@@ auc@@ ans@@ on was des@@ ig@@ ning his rob@@ ot mus@@ ic@@ ian , he had another idea ."
"If you could prog@@ ram a machine to make pleas@@ ing s@@ oun@@ ds , why not prog@@ ram it to we@@ ave del@@ igh@@ t@@ ful pat@@ ter@@ n@@ s of col@@ or out of cl@@ ot@@ h ?"
"If you wanted a new pat@@ tern for your f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , you just program@@ m@@ ed a new c@@ y@@ l@@ ind@@ er ."
This was the first program@@ ma@@ ble loo@@ m .
So ask yourself this question : what really made the modern computer possible ?
"@@ Y@@ es , the mil@@ it@@ ary inv@@ ol@@ v@@ ement is an important part of the story , but inv@@ ent@@ ing a computer also requ@@ i@@ red other buil@@ ding b@@ loc@@ ks : music bo@@ x@@ es , to@@ y rob@@ ot fl@@ ute play@@ ers , har@@ p@@ sich@@ or@@ d k@@ ey@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , col@@ or@@ ful pat@@ ter@@ n@@ s w@@ ov@@ en into f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , and that &apos;s just a small part of the story ."
N@@ ec@@ ess@@ ity isn &apos;t always the mother of inv@@ en@@ tion .
"The play@@ ful state of mind is fundam@@ ent@@ ally expl@@ or@@ at@@ ory , see@@ king out new possibil@@ ities in the world around us ."
And that see@@ king is why so many experi@@ ences that started with simple d@@ eli@@ ght and am@@ us@@ ement ev@@ ent@@ ually led us to pro@@ found bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one need@@ s a co@@ ach .
"It doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a bas@@ ket@@ b@@ all play@@ er , a t@@ en@@ nis play@@ er , a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast or a br@@ id@@ ge play@@ er ."
We all need people who will give us fe@@ ed@@ back .
That &apos;s how we impro@@ ve .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , there &apos;s one group of people who get almost no sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic fe@@ ed@@ back to help them do their j@@ obs better , and these people have one of the most important j@@ obs in the world ."
I &apos;m talking about teachers .
"When M@@ el@@ inda and I learned how little us@@ e@@ ful fe@@ ed@@ back most teachers get , we were blo@@ wn away ."
"@@ Un@@ til rec@@ ently , over 9@@ 8 percent of teachers just got one word of fe@@ ed@@ back : S@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ t@@ ory ."
"If all my br@@ id@@ ge co@@ ach ever told me was that I was &quot; &quot; sat@@ is@@ fac@@ t@@ ory , &quot; &quot; I would have no hop@@ e of ever getting better ."
How would I know who was the best ?
How would I know what I was doing differ@@ ently ?
"@@ To@@ day , dis@@ tric@@ ts are re@@ v@@ am@@ ping the way they ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate teachers , but we still give them almost no fe@@ ed@@ back that actually hel@@ ps them impro@@ ve their pra@@ c@@ tice ."
O@@ ur teachers des@@ er@@ ve better .
The system we have today isn &apos;t fa@@ ir to them .
"It &apos;s not fa@@ ir to students , and it &apos;s p@@ ut@@ ting America &apos;s global lead@@ er@@ ship at ris@@ k ."
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the to@@ ols for impro@@ v@@ ement they want and des@@ er@@ ve .
Let &apos;s start by asking who &apos;s doing well .
"Well , un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately there &apos;s no inter@@ national ran@@ king t@@ ab@@ les for teacher fe@@ ed@@ back sy@@ st@@ ems ."
Con@@ s@@ ider the ran@@ k@@ ings for read@@ ing pro@@ fici@@ en@@ cy .
The U.S. isn &apos;t number one .
We &apos;re not even in the top 10 .
We &apos;re ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th with I@@ cel@@ and and P@@ ol@@ and .
"Now , out of all the plac@@ es that do better than the U.S. in read@@ ing , how many of them have a forma@@ l system for hel@@ ping teachers impro@@ ve ?"
E@@ l@@ even out of 14 .
"The U.S. is ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th in read@@ ing , but we &apos;re 2@@ 3@@ r@@ d in science and 3@@ 1@@ st in mat@@ h ."
"So there &apos;s really only one are@@ a where we &apos;re ne@@ ar the top , and that &apos;s in fail@@ ing to give our teachers the help they need to devel@@ op their sk@@ il@@ ls ."
"@@ Let &apos;s look at the best ac@@ ade@@ mic per@@ form@@ er : the pro@@ vin@@ ce of S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai , China ."
"Now , they r@@ ank number one across the bo@@ ard , in read@@ ing , mat@@ h and science , and one of the k@@ ey@@ s to S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai &apos;s incredible success is the way they help teachers keep impro@@ v@@ ing ."
They made sure that youn@@ ger teachers get a chan@@ ce to watch ma@@ st@@ er teachers at work .
"They have we@@ ek@@ ly study groups , where teachers get together and talk about what &apos;s working ."
They even requ@@ ire each teacher to ob@@ ser@@ ve and give fe@@ ed@@ back to their colle@@ ag@@ ues .
"You might ask , why is a system like this so important ?"
It &apos;s because there &apos;s so much vari@@ ation in the teach@@ ing profes@@ sion .
S@@ ome teachers are far more ef@@ fec@@ tive than others .
"In fact , there are teachers throu@@ gh@@ out the country who are hel@@ ping their students make ex@@ tra@@ ordinary ga@@ ins ."
"If today &apos;s average teacher could become as good as those teachers , our students would be blo@@ wing away the rest of the world ."
So we need a system that hel@@ ps all our teachers be as good as the best .
What would that system look like ?
"Well , to find out , our f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion has been working with 3@@ ,000 teachers in dis@@ tric@@ ts across the country on a project called M@@ eas@@ ures of E@@ f@@ fec@@ tive T@@ e@@ ach@@ ing ."
