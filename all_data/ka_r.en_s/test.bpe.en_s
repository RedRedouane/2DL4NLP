To@@ day I &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expec@@ ted disc@@ over@@ ies .
Now I work in the solar technology ind@@ u@@ str@@ y .
And my small star@@ t@@ up is looking to force ourselves into the environ@@ ment by pa@@ ying att@@ en@@ tion to ...
... pa@@ ying att@@ en@@ tion to c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ -@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ ing .
It &apos;s just a quic@@ k video of what we do .
H@@ u@@ h . H@@ ang on a moment .
It might take a moment to lo@@ ad .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just sk@@ i@@ p — I &apos;ll just sk@@ i@@ p through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( M@@ us@@ ic ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
O@@ kay . ( Laughter )
S@@ ol@@ ar technology is ...
"O@@ h , that &apos;s all my time ?"
O@@ kay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by of@@ fer@@ ing you a f@@ ree no@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h life h@@ ack , and all it requ@@ ir@@ es of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ dit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making your@@ selves sm@@ all@@ er ?
S@@ ome@@ times we hold on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we sp@@ read out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pa@@ y att@@ en@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re particul@@ arly interes@@ ted in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interes@@ ted in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an a@@ w@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a s@@ mil@@ e , or a cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very a@@ w@@ k@@ ward w@@ ink , or maybe even something like a h@@ and@@ sh@@ ake ."
N@@ ar@@ ra@@ tor : Here they are ar@@ r@@ iv@@ ing at N@@ umb@@ er 10 .
E@@ v@@ en the B@@ B@@ C and The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es .
"So ob@@ vi@@ ously when we think about n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al behav@@ ior , or body language — but we call it n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scient@@ ists — it &apos;s language , so we think about commun@@ ic@@ ation ."
"When we think about commun@@ ic@@ ation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ wee@@ ping j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
"And those j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments can predic@@ t really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life ou@@ t@@ comes like who we h@@ ire or pro@@ mo@@ te , who we ask out on a da@@ te ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ ini A@@ m@@ b@@ ad@@ y , a rese@@ arch@@ er at T@@ uf@@ ts Un@@ iver@@ s@@ ity , sho@@ ws that when people watch 3@@ 0-@@ second s@@ ou@@ nd@@ less cli@@ ps of real physic@@ i@@ an@@ -@@ pati@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments of the physic@@ ian &apos;s n@@ ic@@ en@@ ess predic@@ t whether or not that physic@@ ian will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them poor@@ ly , bad idea . R@@ ight ?"
"We are also in@@ flu@@ enc@@ ed by our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ ghts and our feel@@ ings and our ph@@ y@@ si@@ ology ."
So what n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psych@@ olog@@ ist . I study pre@@ j@@ ud@@ ice , and I te@@ ach at a comp@@ et@@ itive b@@ usiness school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interes@@ ted in power d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
I bec@@ ame es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally interes@@ ted in n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and domin@@ ance .
And what are n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and domin@@ ance ?
"So in the an@@ ima@@ l k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about exp@@ anding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically op@@ ening up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ ening up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pr@@ ide , J@@ es@@ sic@@ a Tra@@ cy has studi@@ ed ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really po@@ wer@@ ful with us , we t@@ end to make ourselves sm@@ all@@ er . We don &apos;t mir@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ch@@ ing this behav@@ ior in the clas@@ s@@ room , and what do I not@@ ice ?"
"When they s@@ it down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ read out ."
"You have other people who are vir@@ tually col@@ l@@ ap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I not@@ ice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more lik@@ ely to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ omen feel ch@@ ron@@ ically less po@@ wer@@ ful than men , so this is not sur@@ pris@@ ing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A clas@@ s@@ room , because parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So b@@ usiness schools have been str@@ ug@@ gl@@ ing with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , ok@@ ay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating ."
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
"So , for example , we s@@ mil@@ e when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ ced to s@@ mil@@ e by hol@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ et@@ h like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ di@@ es , but is it also true that our bo@@ di@@ es change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the po@@ wer@@ ful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the po@@ wer@@ ful ver@@ s@@ us the po@@ wer@@ less look like ?
"So po@@ wer@@ ful people t@@ end to be , not sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ f@@ ident , more op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to w@@ in even at gam@@ es of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ris@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to st@@ ress ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power lead@@ er that &apos;s domin@@ ant , high on t@@ est@@ os@@ ter@@ one , but really st@@ ress re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"@@ P@@ rob@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at le@@ ast at the f@@ aci@@ al level , and also that ro@@ le changes can shape the mind ."
"So what happens , ok@@ ay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ ima@@ l level , like this tiny man@@ i@@ pul@@ ation , this tiny inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be st@@ anding or you can be sit@@ ting .
And here are the lo@@ w@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re tou@@ ch@@ ing your nec@@ k , you &apos;re really pro@@ t@@ ec@@ ting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on t@@ est@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ t@@ is@@ ol .
"So it seems that our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als do g@@ over@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ di@@ es change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative sit@@ u@@ ations , like social thre@@ at sit@@ u@@ ations ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being rec@@ ord@@ ed .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led ."
People h@@ ate this .
"We then have these cod@@ ers look at these t@@ ap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis . They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the con@@ diti@@ ons .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ ec@@ h .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s driv@@ ing the ef@@ fect , or medi@@ ating the ef@@ fect ."
"So I said , f@@ ake it t@@ ill you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad c@@ ar acc@@ ident ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a c@@ ar , ro@@ l@@ led s@@ ever@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the c@@ ar .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had id@@ enti@@ fied with being s@@ mart , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish college ."
I am an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feel@@ ing ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e , she can f@@ ake it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t f@@ ake it t@@ ill you make it ."
F@@ ake it t@@ ill you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ al@@ ize .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y tw@@ e@@ ak@@ s can le@@ ad to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ w@@ o minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your t@@ est@@ os@@ ter@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ t@@ is@@ ol down .
"D@@ on &apos;t leave that sit@@ u@@ ation feel@@ ing like , o@@ h , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .
"So it &apos;s 19@@ 9@@ 5 , I &apos;m in college , and a fri@@ end and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from P@@ ro@@ vid@@ ence , R@@ h@@ od@@ e I@@ sl@@ and to P@@ or@@ t@@ l@@ and , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ ed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ ad@@ s through state par@@ ks and national for@@ es@@ ts — basically the lon@@ gest ro@@ ute we can possi@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of S@@ ou@@ th D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my fri@@ end and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 mil@@ es ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter I keep see@@ ing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
M@@ y fri@@ end looks at me tot@@ ally bl@@ an@@ k@@ ly .
There &apos;s actually a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man in the fron@@ t row who &apos;s doing a per@@ fect im@@ itation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sign@@ s we keep see@@ ing with the Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few mo@@ ments , and then she cra@@ c@@ ks up , because she fig@@ ures out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight , the famo@@ us Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter for pic@@ n@@ ic are@@ a . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years of my life thinking about sit@@ u@@ ations exactly like this — why we some@@ times mis@@ understand the sign@@ s around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ ris say , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might st@@ ri@@ ke you as a strange c@@ are@@ er move , but it actually has one great adv@@ ant@@ age : no job comp@@ et@@ ition ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ o@@ id thinking about being wrong , or at le@@ ast to av@@ o@@ id thinking about the possibil@@ ity that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t .
We all know everybody in this room makes mis@@ takes .
"The human spec@@ ies , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — ok@@ ay fin@@ e ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beli@@ ef@@ s I hold , here in the pres@@ ent t@@ en@@ se , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly all of this ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ bil@@ ity goes out the w@@ ind@@ ow — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the pres@@ ent t@@ en@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the pres@@ ent t@@ en@@ se ; we go on family vac@@ ations in the pres@@ ent t@@ en@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and v@@ ot@@ e in the pres@@ ent t@@ en@@ se .
"So ef@@ fec@@ ti@@ vely , we all kind of w@@ ind up tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing through life , tra@@ pped in this little bub@@ ble of feel@@ ing very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individ@@ u@@ als , in our per@@ s@@ onal and profes@@ si@@ onal lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us col@@ lec@@ ti@@ vely as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to con@@ vin@@ ce you that it is possible to ste@@ p outside of that feel@@ ing and that if you can do so , it is the single gre@@ at@@ est moral , int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ al and cre@@ ative le@@ a@@ p you can make ."
So why do we get st@@ uc@@ k in this feel@@ ing of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feel@@ ing of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you gu@@ ys something — or actually , let me ask you gu@@ ys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emo@@ tion@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ umb@@ s down .
"E@@ m@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing . O@@ kay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ umb@@ s down , em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing — th@@ ank you , these are great ans@@ w@@ ers , but they &apos;re ans@@ w@@ ers to a different question ."
You gu@@ ys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to real@@ ize you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) R@@ e@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be dev@@ ast@@ ating , it can be re@@ vel@@ at@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ ny , like my st@@ up@@ id Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter mis@@ take ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an anal@@ og@@ y .
Do you remem@@ ber that L@@ o@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ y@@ ot@@ e who &apos;s always ch@@ as@@ ing and never cat@@ ch@@ ing a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every e@@ p@@ is@@ od@@ e of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e is ch@@ as@@ ing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a c@@ lif@@ f , which is fin@@ e — he &apos;s a bir@@ d , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e run@@ s off the c@@ lif@@ f right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ ny — at le@@ ast if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e &apos;s tot@@ ally fin@@ e too .
He just ke@@ e@@ ps run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and realiz@@ es that he &apos;s in mid@@ -@@ air .
That &apos;s when he f@@ all@@ s .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we real@@ ize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ot@@ e after he &apos;s g@@ one off the c@@ lif@@ f and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in tro@@ ub@@ le , but we feel like we &apos;re on sol@@ id ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ rec@@ t something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it fe@@ els like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ t@@ ural reason , why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r bl@@ ind@@ ness .
"M@@ ost of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ n@@ al c@@ ue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing as well — and this one is cul@@ t@@ ural .
Th@@ ink back for a moment to el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school .
"You &apos;re sit@@ ting there in clas@@ s , and your teacher is h@@ anding back qu@@ i@@ z p@@ ap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not min@@ e , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the k@@ id who got this p@@ ap@@ er ."
"It &apos;s the d@@ um@@ b k@@ id , the tro@@ ub@@ le@@ mak@@ er , the one who never does his h@@ ome@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are l@@ az@@ y , ir@@ responsi@@ ble di@@ m@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to suc@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any mis@@ takes ."
We learn these really bad l@@ ess@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I sus@@ p@@ ect , es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally a lot of us in this room — de@@ al with them by just becom@@ ing per@@ fect little A students , per@@ fec@@ tion@@ ists , over@@ -@@ achi@@ ev@@ ers ."
"@@ R@@ ight , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ physic@@ ist , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ physic@@ ists , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so fin@@ e ."
E@@ x@@ cept that then we fre@@ ak out at the possibil@@ ity that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because acc@@ ord@@ ing to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ s@@ ist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel s@@ mart and responsi@@ ble and vir@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el D@@ e@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ ed@@ ical C@@ en@@ ter for a sur@@ g@@ ery ."
B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ ton .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing h@@ os@@ p@@ ital for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"She &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — st@@ it@@ ch@@ es her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the rec@@ ov@@ ery room ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing seems to have g@@ one fin@@ e .
"And she w@@ ak@@ es up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in ban@@ da@@ g@@ es ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in ban@@ da@@ g@@ es because the sur@@ ge@@ on has per@@ form@@ ed a ma@@ j@@ or oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the vic@@ e pres@@ ident for health care qu@@ ality at B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el sp@@ o@@ ke about this inc@@ ident , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or wh@@ at@@ ever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply f@@ el@@ t that he was on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of the pati@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tr@@ ust@@ ing too much in the feel@@ ing of being on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of anything can be very dan@@ ger@@ ous ."
This inter@@ n@@ al sense of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that we all experience so of@@ ten is not a rel@@ i@@ able gu@@ ide to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop ent@@ ert@@ ain@@ ing the possibil@@ ity that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like d@@ um@@ ping 200 million g@@ all@@ ons of oil into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or t@@ or@@ p@@ ed@@ o@@ ing the global econom@@ y ."
So this is a hu@@ ge pra@@ c@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a hu@@ ge social problem .
Th@@ ink for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beli@@ ef@@ s just per@@ fec@@ tly re@@ fl@@ ect reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who di@@ sa@@ g@@ ree with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by res@@ or@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate as@@ s@@ um@@ p@@ tions ."
The first thing we us@@ ually do when someone di@@ sa@@ gre@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ign@@ or@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have acc@@ ess to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our te@@ am ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still di@@ sa@@ g@@ ree with us , then we move on to a second as@@ s@@ um@@ p@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re id@@ i@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right piec@@ es of the p@@ uz@@ z@@ le , and they are too mo@@ ron@@ ic to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who di@@ sa@@ g@@ ree with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty s@@ mart , then we move on to a th@@ ir@@ d as@@ s@@ um@@ p@@ tion : they know the tr@@ uth , and they are del@@ ib@@ er@@ ately dis@@ t@@ or@@ ting it for their own mal@@ evol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ he .
This att@@ ach@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ke@@ e@@ ps us from pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing mis@@ takes when we absol@@ ut@@ ely need to and c@@ a@@ us@@ es us to treat each other ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most b@@ af@@ fl@@ ing and most tra@@ g@@ ic about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these per@@ fec@@ tly trans@@ l@@ uc@@ ent w@@ indo@@ ws and we just ga@@ ze out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to ga@@ ze out of the same w@@ ind@@ ow and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The mi@@ ra@@ cle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remem@@ ber the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same ni@@ ght sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ t@@ es said his famo@@ us thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St@@ . A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , sa@@ t down and w@@ ro@@ te &quot; &quot; F@@ all@@ or er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine underst@@ ood that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing de@@ fect in the human system , something we can er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ate or over@@ come ."
It &apos;s tot@@ ally fundam@@ ental to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like G@@ od , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other an@@ im@@ als , we are ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with trying to fig@@ ure it out ."
"T@@ o me , this ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion is the s@@ our@@ ce and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ ti@@ vity and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"@@ L@@ ast year , for vari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found myself l@@ ist@@ ening to a lot of e@@ p@@ is@@ odes of the P@@ ub@@ li@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o show This American L@@ i@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m l@@ ist@@ ening and I &apos;m l@@ ist@@ ening , and at some point , I start feel@@ ing like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the cra@@ z@@ y w@@ ron@@ gn@@ ess l@@ ad@@ y .
"I just imag@@ ined it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ ra G@@ las@@ s , who &apos;s the h@@ ost of the show ."
"And I men@@ tion@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ af@@ f , we jo@@ ke that every single e@@ p@@ is@@ od@@ e of our show has the same c@@ r@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the c@@ r@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra G@@ las@@ s , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mo@@ ments of sur@@ pr@@ ise and re@@ ver@@ sa@@ l and w@@ ron@@ gn@@ ess to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audi@@ ence mem@@ b@@ ers , as l@@ ist@@ en@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like pl@@ ot tw@@ ists and red her@@ r@@ ings and sur@@ pr@@ ise end@@ ings .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"@@ G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ ush thought he was going to inv@@ ad@@ e I@@ ra@@ q , find a bun@@ ch of we@@ ap@@ ons of mas@@ s des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion , liber@@ ate the people and bring democra@@ cy to the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ."
And something else happened instead .
"And H@@ os@@ n@@ i M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak thought he was going to be the dic@@ t@@ at@@ or of E@@ g@@ yp@@ t for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sic@@ k and could pas@@ s the re@@ ign@@ s of power on@@ to his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ wee@@ the@@ art and move back to your h@@ ome@@ to@@ wn and ra@@ ise a bun@@ ch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writ@@ ing an incredi@@ bly ner@@ d@@ y bo@@ ok about a sub@@ ject everybody h@@ ates for an audi@@ ence that would never materi@@ al@@ ize .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and ast@@ on@@ ish@@ es us ."
"@@ No of@@ f@@ en@@ se , but this enti@@ re con@@ fer@@ ence is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ ument to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just sp@@ ent an enti@@ re wee@@ k talking about in@@ nov@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ cem@@ ents and impro@@ v@@ ements , but you know why we need all of those in@@ nov@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ cem@@ ents and impro@@ v@@ ements ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d@@ -@@ b@@ og@@ gl@@ ing and wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TE@@ D 19@@ 9@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) D@@ id@@ n &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"Wh@@ ere &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ack , Ch@@ ris ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you gu@@ ys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ disc@@ ov@@ ery of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disc@@ over won@@ der , you need to ste@@ p outside of that tiny , ter@@ ri@@ fied space of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the v@@ ast@@ ness and compl@@ ex@@ ity and my@@ st@@ ery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
M@@ aybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you gu@@ ys . ( Applause )
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0-@@ day challen@@ g@@ es .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that adv@@ ent@@ u@@ ro@@ us before I started my 3@@ 0-@@ day challen@@ g@@ es .
It &apos;s a@@ w@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fu@@ n ."
( Applause )
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ d@@ y , when I grow up , I want to be a form@@ er pres@@ ident . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great bl@@ ess@@ ing as a form@@ er pres@@ ident , because I have had an acc@@ ess that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"@@ Not only am I famil@@ i@@ ar with the 50 states in the United States , but also my wife and I have vis@@ ited more than 1@@ 45 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter has had ful@@ l@@ -@@ time program@@ s in 8@@ 0 na@@ tions on Earth ."
"So our over@@ all com@@ mit@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is to pro@@ mo@@ te human ri@@ ghts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equ@@ iv@@ oc@@ ation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ ghts on Earth is , str@@ ang@@ ely , not ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed quite of@@ ten , is the ab@@ use of women and girls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to be@@ g@@ in with .
"F@@ irst of all is the mis@@ inter@@ pret@@ ation of religi@@ ous sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures , hol@@ y sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures , in the B@@ ible , O@@ ld T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , Q@@ ura@@ n and so for@@ th , and these have been mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ c@@ end@@ ant pos@@ iti@@ ons in the sy@@ n@@ ag@@ og@@ ues and the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es and in the mo@@ squ@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these rul@@ es to make sure that women are ordin@@ ar@@ ily rel@@ e@@ ga@@ ted to a secon@@ dar@@ y position com@@ par@@ ed to men in the ey@@ es of G@@ od .
This is a very seri@@ ous problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ ar@@ ily not ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed .
But the bas@@ ic thing is the sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures are mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ c@@ end@@ ant position .
"That is an all@@ -@@ per@@ v@@ as@@ ive problem , because men can ex@@ ert that power and if an ab@@ us@@ ive h@@ us@@ b@@ and or an em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ er , for inst@@ ance , wan@@ ts to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equal in the ey@@ es of G@@ od , why should I treat them as equ@@ als myself ?"
"The other very seri@@ ous b@@ light that c@@ a@@ us@@ es this problem is the exc@@ es@@ sive res@@ or@@ t to violence , and that is increas@@ ing tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously around the world ."
"When I was in of@@ fic@@ e as govern@@ or of G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ ia , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans were in pris@@ on ."
"@@ N@@ ow@@ ada@@ ys , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pris@@ on ."
That &apos;s a s@@ ev@@ en@@ f@@ old increase .
And we r@@ ank right al@@ on@@ g@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ us@@ ive in all el@@ ements of human ri@@ ghts in en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging the de@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty .
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it c@@ os@@ ts C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia to sen@@ d a person to be ex@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed ."
"@@ Let me just go down a very few ab@@ us@@ es of women that con@@ c@@ er@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fa@@ ir@@ ly bri@@ ef , because I have a lim@@ ited amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital m@@ ut@@ il@@ ation .
"And some@@ times , in more extre@@ me c@@ as@@ es but not very r@@ are c@@ as@@ es , they se@@ w the ori@@ fic@@ e up so the girl can just ur@@ in@@ ate or men@@ str@@ u@@ ate ."
"This is not a r@@ are thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , for inst@@ ance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the f@@ em@@ al@@ es that live in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t today have been s@@ ex@@ ually m@@ ut@@ il@@ ated in that way ."
This is a hor@@ ri@@ ble af@@ fl@@ ic@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
"And this is done by mem@@ b@@ ers of her own family , so the family becom@@ es m@@ ur@@ der@@ ers when the girl br@@ ings so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gra@@ ce to the family ."
"A@@ n@@ other problem that we have in the world that rel@@ ates to women particul@@ arly is sl@@ av@@ ery , or human t@@ raf@@ fic@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ w@@ ada@@ ys ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people s@@ old from A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a into sl@@ av@@ ery in the New World back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now liv@@ ing in sl@@ av@@ ery .
"The United States D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment of St@@ ate now has a man@@ da@@ te from Con@@ g@@ ress to give a re@@ port every year , and the St@@ ate D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment re@@ por@@ ts that 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people are s@@ old across inter@@ national b@@ ord@@ ers every year into sl@@ av@@ ery , and that 8@@ 0 percent of those s@@ old are women , into s@@ ex@@ ual sl@@ av@@ ery ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are liv@@ ing in human b@@ on@@ da@@ ge , or sl@@ av@@ ery ."
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ ia , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is loc@@ ated and where I te@@ ach at E@@ mor@@ y Un@@ iver@@ s@@ ity , they have between 200 and 3@@ 00 women , people s@@ old into sl@@ av@@ ery every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the na@@ tion because of that .
"If a bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner wan@@ ts to buy a girl that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ it@@ e-@@ sk@@ in@@ ned girl br@@ ings s@@ ever@@ al times more than that , and the average bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per sl@@ ave ."
"The sex tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ ia , ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ s the tot@@ al dru@@ g tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ ia ."
Swed@@ en has got a good approach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , Swed@@ en decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed if they are in s@@ ex@@ ual sl@@ av@@ ery , but the bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ n@@ ers and the p@@ im@@ ps and the mal@@ e cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed , and — ( Applause ) — pro@@ st@@ it@@ ution has g@@ one down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite position ."
"For every mal@@ e ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed for il@@ le@@ ga@@ l sex tra@@ de , 2@@ 5 women are ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed in the United States of America ."
"In the mil@@ it@@ ary , they are now anal@@ y@@ zing how many s@@ ex@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ults take place ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed , and the reason is that the com@@ man@@ ding of@@ fic@@ er of any organiz@@ ation — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a b@@ at@@ tal@@ ion in the Ar@@ my or a comp@@ any in the Mar@@ ines — the com@@ man@@ ding of@@ fic@@ er has the right under la@@ w to dec@@ ide whether to pro@@ sec@@ ute a ra@@ p@@ ist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their com@@ m@@ and , s@@ ex@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ults are tak@@ ing place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w need@@ s to be changed .
They &apos;re not pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ n@@ other thing that &apos;s very seri@@ ous about the ab@@ use of women and girls is the l@@ ack of equal pa@@ y for equal work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is some@@ times mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted , but for ful@@ l@@ -@@ time em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I bec@@ ame pres@@ ident , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ or@@ tun@@ e 5@@ 00 comp@@ an@@ ies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 5@@ 00 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an average than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ n@@ other problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like na@@ tion on Earth .
We have been to war with about 2@@ 5 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d World War .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground f@@ igh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been fl@@ ying over@@ head dro@@ p@@ ping bomb@@ s on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have d@@ ron@@ es that att@@ ack people and so for@@ th ."
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the res@@ or@@ t to violence and the mis@@ inter@@ pret@@ ation of the hol@@ y sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures are what c@@ a@@ us@@ es , are the bas@@ ic c@@ a@@ us@@ es , of ab@@ use of women and girls ."
"There &apos;s one more bas@@ ic cause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a dam@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and girls qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly ac@@ cep@@ ts the pr@@ ivil@@ eg@@ ed position that we occ@@ up@@ y , and this is very si@@ mil@@ ar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ par@@ ate but equal had ex@@ is@@ ted ."
"E@@ v@@ en though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ jo@@ y a pr@@ ivil@@ eg@@ ed position ."
So what is the bas@@ ic thing that we need to do today ?
The average woman in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t doesn &apos;t have much to say about her dau@@ gh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally m@@ ut@@ il@@ ated and so for@@ th .
Thank you very much .
"M@@ y big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ loc@@ k bil@@ lions of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ or@@ man@@ t inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of t@@ y@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ de@@ pr@@ iv@@ ed women .
"And I learned the hard way , the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ ep ."
"T@@ wo@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ half years ago , I f@@ ain@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my des@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ ek@@ b@@ one , I got five st@@ it@@ ch@@ es on my right ey@@ e ."
And I be@@ gan the jour@@ ney of re@@ disc@@ over@@ ing the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I studi@@ ed , I met with med@@ ical doc@@ tors , scient@@ ists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more in@@ sp@@ i@@ red , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new re@@ vol@@ ution , this new f@@ em@@ in@@ ist issue ."
"We are liter@@ ally going to s@@ le@@ ep our way to the top , liter@@ ally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately for men , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pr@@ iv@@ ation has become a vir@@ il@@ ity sym@@ b@@ ol ."
I was rec@@ ently having din@@ ner with a guy who bra@@ g@@ g@@ ed that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four h@@ ours s@@ le@@ ep the ni@@ ght before .
"And I f@@ el@@ t like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I f@@ el@@ t like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this din@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pr@@ iv@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ fas@@ t da@@ te , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re lik@@ ely to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k is too l@@ ate for me , but that &apos;s ok@@ ay , I can get a game of t@@ en@@ nis in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence call@@ s and me@@ et you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly b@@ us@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the tr@@ uth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had br@@ il@@ li@@ ant lead@@ ers in b@@ usiness , in fin@@ ance , in polit@@ ics , making ter@@ ri@@ ble dec@@ is@@ ions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good lead@@ er , because the ess@@ ence of lead@@ er@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ eb@@ er@@ gs h@@ it@@ ting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ics .
"In fact , I have a feel@@ ing that if Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ ist@@ ers , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ ile all the bro@@ thers were b@@ us@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ connec@@ ted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a sis@@ ter would have not@@ ic@@ ed the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g , because she would have wo@@ ken up from a s@@ ev@@ en@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ hal@@ f@@ - or e@@ igh@@ t@@ -@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the multi@@ ple c@@ ris@@ es in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a per@@ s@@ onal level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , gra@@ tit@@ u@@ de , ef@@ fec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own c@@ are@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your ey@@ es and disc@@ over the great ideas that li@@ e inside us , to sh@@ ut your en@@ gin@@ es and disc@@ over the power of s@@ le@@ ep ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Well , as Ch@@ ris poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the fun@@ c@@ tions and struc@@ ture of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a min@@ ute about what this ent@@ a@@ ils .
"@@ Here is this mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly , thre@@ e-@@ p@@ ound mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand , and it can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ ell@@ ar space ."
It can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate itself cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ating on the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this p@@ ec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the hol@@ y gra@@ il of neuro@@ science , of neuro@@ log@@ y , and h@@ o@@ pe@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ ous or@@ gan ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little w@@ is@@ ps of pro@@ to@@ pl@@ as@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this acti@@ vity emer@@ g@@ es the whole spec@@ tr@@ um of abil@@ ities that we call human nature and human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the fun@@ c@@ tions of the human brain ."
"One approach , the one we use main@@ ly , is to look at patients with su@@ st@@ ained da@@ mag@@ e to a small regi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gen@@ e@@ tic change in a small regi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ ities , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your c@@ ogn@@ itive abil@@ ity ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly sel@@ ec@@ tive l@@ os@@ s of one fun@@ c@@ tion , with other fun@@ c@@ tions being pres@@ er@@ ved int@@ act , and this giv@@ es you some con@@ f@@ idence in as@@ s@@ ert@@ ing that that part of the brain is some@@ how inv@@ ol@@ ved in medi@@ ating that fun@@ c@@ tion ."
"So you can then ma@@ p fun@@ c@@ tion on@@ to struc@@ ture , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular fun@@ c@@ tion ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few st@@ ri@@ king exam@@ pl@@ es of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m giving you three exam@@ pl@@ es , six minutes each , d@@ uring this talk ."
The first example is an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me called C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
"If you look at the first sl@@ ide there , that &apos;s the tem@@ por@@ al l@@ ob@@ es , fron@@ t@@ al l@@ ob@@ es , par@@ i@@ et@@ al l@@ ob@@ es , O@@ K — the l@@ ob@@ es that con@@ st@@ it@@ ute the brain ."
"And if you look , t@@ uc@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner sur@@ face of the tem@@ por@@ al l@@ ob@@ es — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little struc@@ ture called the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face are@@ a in the brain , because when it &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you can no longer recogni@@ ze people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still recogni@@ ze them from their vo@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ ah , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even recogni@@ ze yourself in the mir@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you w@@ ink and it w@@ in@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mir@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really recogni@@ ze yourself as yourself ."
O@@ K . Now that sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me is well known as c@@ a@@ used by da@@ mag@@ e to the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few physic@@ i@@ ans have heard about it , not even neuro@@ log@@ ists ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras del@@ us@@ ion , and that is a pati@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise complet@@ ely nor@@ mal , has had a head in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise complet@@ ely nor@@ mal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"She &apos;s some other woman pret@@ end@@ ing to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is per@@ fec@@ tly l@@ u@@ ci@@ d and intellig@@ ent in all other re@@ spec@@ ts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his del@@ us@@ ion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pret@@ ation of this , which you find in all the psych@@ i@@ at@@ ry t@@ ext@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ dian view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same arg@@ ument app@@ lies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about gu@@ ys ."
"When you &apos;re a little b@@ ab@@ y , a young b@@ ab@@ y , you had a strong s@@ ex@@ ual at@@ trac@@ tion to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us compl@@ e@@ x of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the stan@@ dar@@ d F@@ re@@ u@@ dian view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ h@@ ib@@ its these l@@ at@@ ent s@@ ex@@ ual ur@@ g@@ es to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank G@@ od , or you would all be s@@ ex@@ ually ar@@ ous@@ ed when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a bl@@ ow to your head , da@@ mag@@ ing the cor@@ te@@ x , allo@@ wing these l@@ at@@ ent s@@ ex@@ ual ur@@ g@@ es to emer@@ ge , fl@@ am@@ ing to the sur@@ face , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly and in@@ expl@@ ic@@ ably you find yourself being s@@ ex@@ ually ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; M@@ y G@@ od , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being s@@ ex@@ ually turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pret@@ ation that makes sense to your da@@ mag@@ ed brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this arg@@ ument ."
"It &apos;s very ing@@ en@@ i@@ ous , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ dian arg@@ um@@ ents are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same del@@ us@@ ion , a pati@@ ent having the same del@@ us@@ ion , about his p@@ et po@@ od@@ le . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ if@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ if@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ dian ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the l@@ at@@ ent b@@ es@@ ti@@ ality in all hum@@ ans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to explain this cur@@ i@@ ous dis@@ order , we look at the struc@@ ture and fun@@ c@@ tions of the nor@@ mal vis@@ ual pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"@@ N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , vis@@ ual signals come in , into the ey@@ eb@@ all@@ s , go to the vis@@ ual are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ c@@ er@@ ned with just vision , and after proc@@ ess@@ ing all that , the message goes to a small struc@@ ture called the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , where you per@@ ce@@ ive fac@@ es ."
There are neurons there that are sen@@ s@@ itive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face are@@ a of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that are@@ a &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you l@@ ose the abil@@ ity to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that are@@ a , the message c@@ as@@ c@@ ad@@ es into a struc@@ ture called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala in the lim@@ b@@ ic system , the emo@@ tional cor@@ e of the brain , and that struc@@ ture , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , ga@@ ug@@ es the emo@@ tional sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ da@@ tor ? I@@ s it mate ?
"O@@ r is it something absol@@ ut@@ ely tr@@ iv@@ i@@ al , like a piece of l@@ in@@ t , or a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? O@@ K ?"
Wh@@ ich you can complet@@ ely ign@@ ore .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is exc@@ ited , and this is something important , the mes@@ sa@@ g@@ es then c@@ as@@ c@@ ad@@ e into the a@@ ut@@ on@@ omi@@ c nerv@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fas@@ ter .
You start swe@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cul@@ ar ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ tun@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ tro@@ des on your p@@ al@@ m and measure the change in sk@@ in res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce produc@@ ed by swe@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ min@@ e , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exc@@ ited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ous@@ ed , or not , O@@ K ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a min@@ ute .
"So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an ob@@ ject , when he looks at his — any ob@@ ject for that matter , it goes to the vis@@ ual are@@ as and , h@@ ow@@ ever , and it &apos;s proc@@ ess@@ ed in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , and you recogni@@ ze it as a pe@@ a pl@@ ant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , O@@ K ?"
"And then the message c@@ as@@ c@@ ad@@ es into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , and then goes down the a@@ ut@@ on@@ omi@@ c nerv@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that w@@ ire that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala to the lim@@ b@@ ic system , the emo@@ tional cor@@ e of the brain , is c@@ ut by the acc@@ ident ."
"So because the f@@ us@@ i@@ form is int@@ act , the cha@@ p can still recogni@@ ze his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ ah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the w@@ ire is c@@ ut to the emo@@ tional cent@@ ers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? R@@ ight ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ expl@@ ic@@ able l@@ ack of emo@@ tions ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some strange woman pret@@ end@@ ing to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in fron@@ t of a scre@@ en , and measure your gal@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can measure how you swe@@ at when you see an ob@@ ject , like a table or an um@@ br@@ el@@ la . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t swe@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a lion , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start swe@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about nor@@ mal people — you start swe@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ w@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this pati@@ ent ?"
You take the pati@@ ent and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and measure his gal@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and ch@@ air@@ s and l@@ in@@ t , nothing happens , as in nor@@ mal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the gal@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is fl@@ at ."
"There &apos;s no emo@@ tional re@@ action to his mother , because that w@@ ire going from the vis@@ ual are@@ as to the emo@@ tional cent@@ ers is c@@ ut ."
"So his vision is nor@@ mal because the vis@@ ual are@@ as are nor@@ mal , his emo@@ tions are nor@@ mal — he &apos;ll l@@ au@@ gh , he &apos;ll c@@ ry , so on and so for@@ th — but the w@@ ire from vision to emo@@ tions is c@@ ut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this del@@ us@@ ion that his mother is an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"It &apos;s a lov@@ ely example of the sort of thing we do : take a biz@@ ar@@ re , se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble , ne@@ ural psych@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me and say that the stan@@ dar@@ d F@@ re@@ u@@ dian view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a prec@@ ise ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known ne@@ ural an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pati@@ ent then goes , and mother ph@@ ones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pic@@ ks up the ph@@ one , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? Wh@@ ere are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no del@@ us@@ ion through the ph@@ one ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate pa@@ th@@ way going from the he@@ ar@@ ing cent@@ ers in the brain to the emo@@ tional cent@@ ers , and that &apos;s not been c@@ ut by the acc@@ ident ."
"So this expl@@ ains why through the ph@@ one he recogni@@ z@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"O@@ K , how is all this compl@@ e@@ x cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we approach this problem by cons@@ id@@ er@@ ing another cur@@ i@@ ous sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me called ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated , or a le@@ g is am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated , for gan@@ gr@@ en@@ e , or you l@@ ose it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a seri@@ ous problem — you contin@@ ue to v@@ ivid@@ ly feel the pres@@ ence of that mis@@ sing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ tom le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ tom with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , even with inter@@ n@@ al vis@@ c@@ er@@ a ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the ut@@ er@@ us re@@ mov@@ ed — hy@@ st@@ er@@ ec@@ t@@ om@@ y — who have a ph@@ an@@ tom ut@@ er@@ us , in@@ cl@@ ud@@ ing ph@@ an@@ tom men@@ str@@ ual c@@ ram@@ ps at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stud@@ ent asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get ph@@ an@@ tom P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ p@@ e for sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , but we hav@@ en &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s by doing experim@@ ents ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s cl@@ a@@ im that they can move the ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ould@@ er , it &apos;ll answer the ph@@ one when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll w@@ ave go@@ od@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
"Th@@ ese are very comp@@ elling , v@@ iv@@ id sen@@ sa@@ tions ."
The pati@@ ent &apos;s not del@@ us@@ i@@ onal .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess , it &apos;s a comp@@ elling sen@@ s@@ ory experience for the pati@@ ent ."
"But h@@ ow@@ ever , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a cl@@ en@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be rel@@ i@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ?"
It s@@ oun@@ ds like an oxy@@ mo@@ ro@@ n .
"But when we were looking at the case she@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s , the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed because of the peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ j@@ ur@@ y ."
"The ac@@ tu@@ al ner@@ ve sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m was s@@ ever@@ ed , was c@@ ut , by say , a mo@@ t@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ cle acc@@ ident ."
"So the pati@@ ent had an ac@@ tu@@ al ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a sl@@ ing for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ id@@ ed att@@ emp@@ t to get ri@@ d of the pain in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ p@@ ut@@ ates the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m with the same pain@@ s , right ?"
And this is a seri@@ ous cl@@ in@@ ical problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become depres@@ sed .
"S@@ ome of them are driv@@ en to su@@ ic@@ ide , O@@ K ?"
"So , how do you treat this sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case she@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tu@@ al ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m had been c@@ ut , and the ac@@ tu@@ al ar@@ m had been par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , and l@@ ying in a sl@@ ing for s@@ ever@@ al months before the am@@ p@@ ut@@ ation , and this pain then gets car@@ ri@@ ed over into the ph@@ an@@ tom itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was int@@ act , but par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , the brain sen@@ ds com@@ man@@ ds to the ar@@ m , the fron@@ t of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vis@@ ual fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; M@@ ove . No . M@@ ove . No . M@@ ove . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , O@@ K ?"
"The brain lear@@ n@@ s , because of this H@@ eb@@ b@@ ian , as@@ soci@@ ative l@@ ink , that the m@@ ere com@@ m@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ sa@@ tion of a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis car@@ ri@@ es over into your body imag@@ e and into your ph@@ an@@ tom , O@@ K ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"@@ How do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , so you can rel@@ i@@ eve him of this exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating , cl@@ en@@ ch@@ ing sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now sen@@ d the com@@ m@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ tom , but give him vis@@ ual fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s ob@@ ey@@ ing his com@@ m@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ aybe you can rel@@ i@@ eve the ph@@ an@@ tom pain , the ph@@ an@@ tom c@@ ram@@ p ."
"@@ How do you do that ? Well , vir@@ tu@@ al reality ."
But that c@@ os@@ ts mil@@ lions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my f@@ und@@ ing ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) O@@ K ? What you do is you create what I call a mir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard bo@@ x with a mir@@ ro@@ r in the middle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ tom — so my first pati@@ ent , D@@ ere@@ k , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated 10 years ago .
"He had a bra@@ ch@@ i@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were c@@ ut and the ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , l@@ ying in a sl@@ ing for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m , exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful , and he c@@ ouldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a mir@@ ro@@ r like that , in a bo@@ x , which I call a mir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x , right ?"
"And the pati@@ ent p@@ ut@@ s his ph@@ an@@ tom left ar@@ m , which is cl@@ en@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the mir@@ ro@@ r , and the nor@@ mal hand on the right side of the mir@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the cl@@ en@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the mir@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ tom being resur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of the nor@@ mal ar@@ m in the mir@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ tom has been resur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , w@@ ig@@ g@@ le your ph@@ an@@ tom — your real f@@ ing@@ ers , or move your real f@@ ing@@ ers while looking in the mir@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vis@@ ual im@@ pres@@ sion that the ph@@ an@@ tom is mov@@ ing , right ?"
"That &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous , but the ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing thing is , the pati@@ ent then says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is mov@@ ing again , and the pain , the cl@@ en@@ ch@@ ing sp@@ as@@ m , is rel@@ i@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remem@@ ber , my first pati@@ ent who came in — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) M@@ y first pati@@ ent came in , and he looked in the mir@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook at your re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of your ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; And he started g@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not st@@ up@@ id . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a mir@@ ro@@ r re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion , but it &apos;s a v@@ iv@@ id sen@@ s@@ ory experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove your nor@@ mal hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ tom . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove your nor@@ mal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is mov@@ ing again . I don &apos;t believe this !@@ "
And my pain is being rel@@ i@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ l@@ ose your ey@@ es . &quot; &quot; He cl@@ os@@ es his ey@@ es ."
&quot; And move your nor@@ mal hand . &quot;
"&quot; O@@ h , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ en@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ K , op@@ en your ey@@ es . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , o@@ h my G@@ od , it &apos;s mov@@ ing again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a k@@ id in a c@@ and@@ y st@@ ore ."
"So , I said , O@@ K , this pro@@ ves my theory about learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis and the c@@ rit@@ ical ro@@ le of vis@@ ual in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a N@@ ob@@ el P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a complet@@ ely us@@ el@@ ess abil@@ ity , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started realiz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of par@@ al@@ y@@ sis that you see in neuro@@ log@@ y , like st@@ ro@@ ke , f@@ oc@@ al d@@ y@@ st@@ on@@ ias — there may be a learned comp@@ on@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple dev@@ ice of using a mir@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , D@@ ere@@ k &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a mir@@ ro@@ r to all@@ ev@@ i@@ ate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , D@@ ere@@ k , take it home and pra@@ c@@ tice with it for a wee@@ k or two ."
"M@@ aybe , after a peri@@ od of pra@@ c@@ tice , you can dis@@ pen@@ se with the mir@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , and start mov@@ ing your par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m , and then , rel@@ i@@ eve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said O@@ K , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ ake it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he ph@@ ones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s g@@ one . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s g@@ one ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x was g@@ one ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ tom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s di@@ sa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ri@@ ed , I said , my G@@ od , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body imag@@ e , what about human sub@@ jects , e@@ th@@ ics and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ere@@ k , does this b@@ other you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ b@@ ow pain , no cl@@ en@@ ch@@ ing , no ph@@ an@@ tom for@@ ear@@ m pain , all those pain@@ s are g@@ one away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ tom f@@ ing@@ ers dan@@ gl@@ ing from the sh@@ ould@@ er , and your bo@@ x doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the des@@ ign and put it on my for@@ e@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and el@@ im@@ in@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ tom f@@ ing@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of mag@@ ic@@ ian ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sen@@ s@@ ory con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t .
It &apos;s getting mes@@ sa@@ g@@ es from vision saying the ph@@ an@@ tom is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ oc@@ e@@ p@@ tion , mus@@ cle signals saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your mo@@ tor com@@ m@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ tom , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of den@@ i@@ al — it ga@@ t@@ es the signals .
"And when the ar@@ m di@@ sa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars , the b@@ on@@ us is , the pain di@@ sa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars because you can &apos;t have dis@@ em@@ bo@@ di@@ ed pain flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the b@@ on@@ us ."
"Now , this te@@ ch@@ ni@@ qu@@ e has been tried on do@@ z@@ ens of patients by other groups in H@@ el@@ sin@@ ki , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a treat@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ tom pain , and inde@@ ed , people have tried it for st@@ ro@@ ke re@@ h@@ abil@@ itation ."
"S@@ tro@@ ke you nor@@ m@@ ally think of as da@@ mag@@ e to the f@@ ib@@ ers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some comp@@ on@@ ent of st@@ ro@@ ke par@@ al@@ y@@ sis is also learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , and maybe that comp@@ on@@ ent can be over@@ come using mir@@ ro@@ r@@ s ."
"This has also g@@ one through cl@@ in@@ ical trials , hel@@ ping lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ wit@@ ch ge@@ ars now to the th@@ ir@@ d part of my talk , which is about another cur@@ i@@ ous ph@@ enom@@ en@@ on called sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
This was disc@@ over@@ ed by F@@ ran@@ c@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the n@@ in@@ et@@ e@@ ent@@ h century .
He was a cou@@ s@@ in of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise complet@@ ely nor@@ mal , had the follo@@ wing p@@ ec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s col@@ or@@ ed ."
"F@@ ive is bl@@ ue , seven is y@@ ell@@ ow , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is in@@ di@@ go , O@@ K ?"
"B@@ e@@ ar in mind , these people are complet@@ ely nor@@ mal in other re@@ spec@@ ts ."
"O@@ r C shar@@ p — some@@ times , t@@ ones ev@@ o@@ ke col@@ or ."
"@@ C shar@@ p is bl@@ ue , F shar@@ p is gre@@ en , another t@@ one might be y@@ ell@@ ow , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia . G@@ al@@ ton called it sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia , a min@@ gl@@ ing of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dis@@ tin@@ c@@ t ."
These people mud@@ dle up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia run@@ s in famil@@ ies , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a her@@ ed@@ it@@ ary bas@@ is , a gen@@ e@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the ma@@ in the@@ me of this lec@@ ture , which is about cre@@ ati@@ vity — sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia is eight times more common amo@@ n@@ g art@@ ists , po@@ ets , nov@@ el@@ ists and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ? What c@@ a@@ us@@ es it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ ories ."
One theory is they &apos;re just cra@@ z@@ y .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic theory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ n@@ other theory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ k@@ ies and po@@ the@@ ad@@ s , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tr@@ uth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an D@@ i@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ K . Now , the th@@ ir@@ d theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia . A@@ ll right ?"
"So , we found that the col@@ or are@@ a and the number are@@ a are right next to each other in the brain , in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some acc@@ id@@ ental c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing between col@@ or and numbers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
Now remem@@ ber — why does this happen ?
Why would there be c@@ ro@@ s@@ sed w@@ ir@@ es in some people ?
R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber I said it run@@ s in famil@@ ies ?
That giv@@ es you the cl@@ ue .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ nor@@ mal gen@@ e , a m@@ ut@@ ation in the gen@@ e that c@@ a@@ us@@ es this ab@@ nor@@ mal c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain regi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other regi@@ on , and these are tri@@ m@@ m@@ ed down to create the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic mod@@ ul@@ ar arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the ad@@ ult brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e c@@ a@@ using this tri@@ m@@ ming and if that gen@@ e m@@ ut@@ ates , then you get de@@ fici@@ ent tri@@ m@@ ming between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and col@@ or , you get numb@@ er@@ -@@ col@@ or sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and col@@ or , you get t@@ on@@ e-@@ col@@ or sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pres@@ sed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ connec@@ ted ?"
"Well , think about what art@@ ists , nov@@ el@@ ists and po@@ ets have in common , the abil@@ ity to en@@ ga@@ ge in met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking , l@@ in@@ king se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly un@@ rel@@ ated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the eas@@ t , and J@@ ul@@ iet is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , J@@ ul@@ iet is the su@@ n , does that mean she &apos;s a g@@ lo@@ wing b@@ all of fire ?"
"I mean , s@@ ch@@ iz@@ o@@ ph@@ r@@ en@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"@@ N@@ or@@ mal people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the su@@ n , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the su@@ n , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the su@@ n ."
"In@@ stan@@ tly , you &apos;ve found the l@@ in@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this gre@@ ater c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a gre@@ ater pro@@ pen@@ s@@ ity to@@ wards met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking and cre@@ ati@@ vity in people with sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
"And , h@@ ence , the eight times more common inc@@ idence of sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia amo@@ n@@ g po@@ ets , art@@ ists and nov@@ el@@ ists ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ r@@ en@@ ological view of sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
The last demon@@ stra@@ tion — can I take one min@@ ute ?
"( Applause ) O@@ K . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ et@@ es , but you &apos;re in den@@ i@@ al about it ."
"@@ Here &apos;s what I call Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et . Just like your al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"D@@ if@@ fer@@ ent shap@@ es for different ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , right ?"
"@@ Here , you &apos;ve got Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et ."
"One of them is K@@ ik@@ i , one of them is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ."
Wh@@ ich one is K@@ ik@@ i and which one is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ?
