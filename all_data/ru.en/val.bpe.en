"When I was 11 , I remember wa@@ king up one mor@@ ning to the sound of jo@@ y in my house ."
"M@@ y father was list@@ ening to B@@ B@@ C N@@ e@@ ws on his small , gr@@ ay ra@@ di@@ o ."
"There was a big sm@@ ile on his face which was un@@ us@@ ual then , because the news m@@ os@@ tly de@@ pres@@ sed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are g@@ one ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an and made it il@@ le@@ g@@ al for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I dre@@ s@@ sed as a bo@@ y to es@@ c@@ ort my ol@@ der si@@ ster , who was no longer allo@@ wed to be outside al@@ one , to a sec@@ re@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be educ@@ ated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different rou@@ te so that no one would s@@ us@@ p@@ ect where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our bo@@ o@@ ks in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would see@@ m we were just out sh@@ op@@ ping .
"The school was in a house , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small living room ."
It was co@@ z@@ y in win@@ ter but extre@@ me@@ ly h@@ ot in sum@@ m@@ er .
"We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the te@@ ac@@ her , the students and our parents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly be c@@ anc@@ el@@ ed for a week because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were s@@ us@@ pic@@ i@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being fol@@ lo@@ wed ?
D@@ o they know where we live ?
"We were sc@@ ar@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to gro@@ w up in a family where education was pri@@ z@@ ed and d@@ augh@@ ters were tre@@ as@@ u@@ red .
My gr@@ and@@ father was an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary man for his time .
"A t@@ ot@@ al ma@@ ver@@ ick from a re@@ m@@ ote pro@@ v@@ ince of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , he in@@ si@@ st@@ ed that his d@@ aughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was di@@ so@@ w@@ ned by his father ."
But my educ@@ ated mother became a te@@ ac@@ her .
There she is .
"S@@ he re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for gir@@ ls and women in our ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to re@@ ce@@ ive an education .
"There was no question that his children would re@@ ce@@ ive an education , inclu@@ ding his d@@ augh@@ ters , des@@ p@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , des@@ p@@ ite the ris@@ ks ."
"T@@ o him , there was gre@@ ater ris@@ k in not educ@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ uring T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years , I remember there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated by our life and always being sc@@ ar@@ ed and not seeing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , my d@@ aughter , you can l@@ ose everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be for@@ c@@ ed to leave your home during a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to s@@ ell our bloo@@ d to p@@ ay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to contin@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in a country that has been de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed by decad@@ es of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ y@@ on@@ d high school , and had my family not been so comm@@ it@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"I@@ n@@ stead , I st@@ and here a p@@ rou@@ d gra@@ du@@ ate of M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ b@@ ury C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ en I re@@ turned to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , my gr@@ and@@ father , the one ex@@ il@@ ed from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his d@@ augh@@ ters , was am@@ ong the first to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate me ."
"He not only bra@@ gs about my col@@ le@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l ."
( Applause ) My family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ am@@ s even bi@@ g@@ ger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 1@@ 0@@ x@@ 10 , a global cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to educ@@ ate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for gir@@ ls in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , a country where it &apos;s still ri@@ sk@@ y for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
The exc@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with am@@ bi@@ tion gr@@ ab@@ b@@ ing at opport@@ un@@ ity .
"And I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , des@@ p@@ ite and even in the face of d@@ a@@ un@@ ting op@@ posi@@ tion ."
"L@@ i@@ ke A@@ h@@ m@@ ed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I can@@ not show you his face , but A@@ h@@ m@@ ed is the father of one of my students ."
"L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his d@@ aughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their v@@ ill@@ age , and they liter@@ ally mis@@ sed being kill@@ ed by a ro@@ ad@@ side b@@ om@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ ri@@ ved home , the phone ran@@ g , a vo@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he s@@ ent his d@@ aughter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my d@@ aughter &apos;s future because of your old and bac@@ k@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to real@@ ize about A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , and this is something that is often dis@@ mis@@ sed in the W@@ est , that behind most of us who suc@@ ce@@ ed is a father who reco@@ gn@@ iz@@ es the val@@ ue in his d@@ aughter and who se@@ es that her suc@@ cess is his suc@@ cess ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mo@@ thers ar@@ en &apos;t key in our suc@@ cess .
"In fact , they &apos;re often the in@@ i@@ ti@@ al and con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing ne@@ go@@ ti@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their d@@ augh@@ ters , but in the cont@@ ext of a society like in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , we must have the sup@@ port of men ."
"@@ Un@@ der the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , gir@@ ls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hund@@ re@@ ds — remember , it was il@@ le@@ g@@ al ."
"But today , more than three million gir@@ ls are in school in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an ."
( Applause ) A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an looks so different from here in America .
I find that Amer@@ ic@@ ans see the fra@@ g@@ ility in chang@@ es .
I fe@@ ar that these chang@@ es will not last much be@@ y@@ on@@ d the U.@@ S. t@@ ro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , when I see the students in my school and their parents who adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , who enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge them , I see a pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing future and la@@ st@@ ing change ."
"T@@ o me , A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an is a country of hope and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties , and every single day the gir@@ ls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"L@@ i@@ ke me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
And you &apos;ll now see the y@@ ol@@ k and the wh@@ ite have se@@ par@@ ated .
And sli@@ gh@@ tly more comple@@ x things appe@@ ar .
That &apos;s tw@@ ice as long as hum@@ ans have been on this planet .
"And de@@ ep b@@ ene@@ ath those oce@@ ans , at cr@@ ac@@ ks in the Earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , you &apos;ve got he@@ at se@@ ep@@ ing up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great di@@ versity of el@@ em@@ ents ."
"But of course , life is more than just ex@@ o@@ tic chem@@ i@@ stry ."
H@@ um@@ an be@@ ings start p@@ ut@@ ting each other into bo@@ x@@ es the second that they see each other — I@@ s that person d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ? A@@ re they at@@ trac@@ tive ?
A@@ re they a pot@@ ential m@@ ate ? A@@ re they a pot@@ ential net@@ working opport@@ un@@ ity ?
We do this little inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation when we me@@ et people to make a m@@ ental re@@ su@@ me for them .
What &apos;s your name ? Wh@@ ere are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Th@@ en we get more person@@ al with it .
H@@ ave you ever had any dise@@ ases ?
H@@ ave you ever been di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed ?
D@@ o@@ es your bre@@ ath sm@@ ell bad while you &apos;re ans@@ wer@@ ing my inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation right now ?
What are you into ? Wh@@ o are you into ?
What gen@@ der do you like to s@@ le@@ ep with ?
I get it .
We are ne@@ u@@ ro@@ log@@ ically har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to see@@ k out people like ourselves .
We start form@@ ing c@@ li@@ qu@@ es as so@@ on as we &apos;re old enough to know what ac@@ cep@@ t@@ ance fe@@ els like .
"We b@@ on@@ d together based on anything that we can — music pre@@ fer@@ ence , r@@ ace , gen@@ der , the b@@ loc@@ k that we gre@@ w up on ."
We see@@ k out environ@@ ments that re@@ infor@@ ce our person@@ al cho@@ ices .
"S@@ ome@@ times , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s op@@ ening a tin@@ y little bo@@ x and as@@ king you to s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze y@@ our@@ self inside of it ."
"Because the c@@ ate@@ g@@ or@@ ies , I &apos;ve found , are too lim@@ iting ."
The bo@@ x@@ es are too n@@ ar@@ row .
And this can get really d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
"So here &apos;s a dis@@ cl@@ a@@ im@@ er about me , though , before we get too de@@ ep into this ."
I gre@@ w up in a very sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed environment .
"I was ra@@ is@@ ed in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an in the early 19@@ 8@@ 0s , two b@@ loc@@ ks from the e@@ pic@@ en@@ ter of p@@ un@@ k music ."
I was shi@@ el@@ ded from the pa@@ ins of bi@@ g@@ ot@@ ry and the social re@@ str@@ ic@@ tions of a reli@@ gi@@ ous@@ l@@ y-@@ based up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing .
"Wh@@ ere I come from , if you wer@@ en &apos;t a dra@@ g qu@@ een or a ra@@ d@@ ical thin@@ ker or a per@@ form@@ ance arti@@ st of some kind , you were the we@@ ir@@ do ."
"( Laughter ) It was an un@@ or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing , but as a k@@ id on the stre@@ ets of New York , you learn how to tr@@ ust your own inst@@ inc@@ ts , you learn how to go with your own ideas ."
"So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a bo@@ y ."
I went to school one day and the kids w@@ ouldn &apos;t let me play bas@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ all with them .
They said they w@@ ouldn &apos;t let gir@@ ls play .
"So I went home , and I s@@ ha@@ ved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a bo@@ y . &quot; &quot; I mean , who kno@@ ws , right ?"
"When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that ."
"I didn &apos;t want any@@ one to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t ."
I ke@@ pt up the char@@ ad@@ e for e@@ ight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was play@@ ing a k@@ id nam@@ ed W@@ al@@ ter in a movi@@ e called &quot; &quot; J@@ u@@ li@@ an P@@ o . &quot; &quot; I was a little stre@@ et t@@ ough that fol@@ lo@@ wed Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an S@@ later around and b@@ ad@@ g@@ er@@ ed him .
"S@@ e@@ e , I was also a child ac@@ tor , which d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed up the l@@ ay@@ ers of the per@@ form@@ ance of my id@@ enti@@ ty , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really play@@ ing a bo@@ y ."
"In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my te@@ ach@@ ers at school , not my friends , not the direc@@ tors that I worked with ."
K@@ i@@ ds would often come up to me in cl@@ ass and gra@@ b me by the th@@ ro@@ at to ch@@ ec@@ k for an A@@ d@@ am &apos;s app@@ le or gra@@ b my cr@@ ot@@ ch to ch@@ ec@@ k what I was working with .
"When I would go to the b@@ a@@ th@@ room , I would turn my sho@@ es around in the st@@ all@@ s so that it looked like I was pe@@ e@@ ing st@@ anding up ."
A@@ t s@@ le@@ e@@ po@@ ver@@ s I would have p@@ an@@ ic att@@ ac@@ ks trying to bre@@ ak it to gir@@ ls that they didn &apos;t want to k@@ is@@ s me without ou@@ ting myself .
It &apos;s wor@@ th men@@ tion@@ ing though that I didn &apos;t h@@ ate my body or my gen@@ it@@ al@@ ia .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was per@@ form@@ ing this el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate act .
I w@@ ouldn &apos;t have qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ed as trans@@ gen@@ der .
"If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in ther@@ ap@@ y , they probably would have di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ed me as something like gen@@ der d@@ y@@ sm@@ or@@ p@@ hi@@ c and put me on hor@@ mon@@ es to st@@ ave off pub@@ er@@ ty ."
"But in my particular case , I just w@@ o@@ ke up one day when I was 1@@ 4 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again ."
"P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty had h@@ it , and I had no idea what being a girl me@@ ant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was ."
"When a k@@ id beha@@ ves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?"
No one is exactly sho@@ c@@ ked .
( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to de@@ f@@ ine myself by my parents .
"When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had f@@ all@@ en in love , it was the last thing on ei@@ ther of our min@@ ds to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s what the con@@ sequ@@ ences were of the fact that my first love was a girl ."
"Th@@ ree years later , when I f@@ ell in love with a man , ne@@ i@@ ther of my parents b@@ at@@ ted an ey@@ el@@ as@@ h ei@@ ther ."
"S@@ e@@ e , it &apos;s one of the great bl@@ ess@@ ings of my very un@@ or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to de@@ f@@ ine myself as any one thing at any point ."
"I was just allo@@ wed to be me , gro@@ wing and chang@@ ing in every moment ."
"So four , almost five years ago , P@@ ro@@ posi@@ tion 8 , the great mar@@ ri@@ age equ@@ ality de@@ b@@ ate , was ra@@ is@@ ing a lot of d@@ ust around this country ."
"And at the time , getting mar@@ ri@@ ed wasn &apos;t really something I sp@@ ent a lot of time thinking about ."
"But I was struc@@ k by the fact that America , a country with such a t@@ ar@@ ni@@ shed civi@@ l ri@@ ghts rec@@ ord , could be re@@ pe@@ ating its m@@ ist@@ a@@ kes so bl@@ at@@ an@@ tly ."
"And I remember wat@@ ching the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion on t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion and thinking how interesting it was that the se@@ par@@ ation of ch@@ ur@@ ch and state was ess@@ enti@@ ally dra@@ wing ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ ical b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies throu@@ gh@@ out this country , between places where people beli@@ ev@@ ed in it and places where people didn &apos;t ."
"And then , that this di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion was dra@@ wing ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ ical b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies around me ."
"If this was a war with two di@@ sp@@ ar@@ ate si@@ des , I , by de@@ fa@@ ult , f@@ ell on team g@@ ay , because I cer@@ tain@@ ly wasn &apos;t 100 percent stra@@ ight ."
"A@@ t the time I was just beginning to em@@ er@@ ge from this e@@ igh@@ t-@@ year person@@ al id@@ enti@@ ty cri@@ s@@ is z@@ ig@@ z@@ a@@ g that saw me go from being a bo@@ y to being this aw@@ k@@ ward girl that looked like a bo@@ y in girl &apos;s c@@ lo@@ th@@ es to the op@@ pos@@ ite extre@@ me of this sup@@ er sk@@ imp@@ y , over@@ -@@ comp@@ en@@ s@@ ating , bo@@ y-@@ cha@@ sing gir@@ l@@ y-@@ girl to finally just a h@@ es@@ it@@ ant expl@@ or@@ ation of what I actually was , a tom@@ bo@@ y@@ ish girl who li@@ ked both bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls dep@@ en@@ ding on the person ."
"I had sp@@ ent a year photograp@@ h@@ ing this new gener@@ ation of gir@@ ls , much like myself , who f@@ ell kind of be@@ tw@@ e@@ en@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ l@@ ines — gir@@ ls who sk@@ ate@@ bo@@ ar@@ ded but did it in l@@ acy under@@ we@@ ar , gir@@ ls who had bo@@ ys &apos; ha@@ ir@@ cu@@ ts but wor@@ e gir@@ ly na@@ il poli@@ sh , gir@@ ls who had ey@@ es@@ ha@@ d@@ ow to mat@@ ch their sc@@ r@@ ap@@ ed k@@ ne@@ es , gir@@ ls who li@@ ked gir@@ ls and bo@@ ys who all li@@ ked bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls who all h@@ ated being bo@@ x@@ ed in to anything ."
"I lo@@ ved these people , and I ad@@ mi@@ red their fre@@ e@@ dom , but I wat@@ ched as the world outside of our ut@@ op@@ i@@ an bu@@ b@@ ble exp@@ lo@@ ded into these ra@@ g@@ ing de@@ b@@ ates where p@@ und@@ its started li@@ k@@ ening our love to b@@ es@@ ti@@ ality on national t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion ."
"And this powerful a@@ war@@ en@@ ess ro@@ l@@ led in over me that I was a min@@ or@@ ity , and in my own home country , based on one fac@@ et of my char@@ ac@@ ter ."
I was le@@ g@@ ally and in@@ di@@ sp@@ ut@@ ably a secon@@ d@@ -@@ cl@@ ass ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en .
I was not an ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st .
I w@@ ave no fl@@ ag@@ s in my own life .
But I was pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed by this question : How could any@@ one v@@ ote to stri@@ p the ri@@ ghts of the v@@ ast vari@@ ety of people that I knew based on one el@@ ement of their char@@ ac@@ ter ?
How could they say that we as a group were not des@@ er@@ ving of equ@@ al ri@@ ghts as somebody else ?
W@@ ere we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even con@@ sci@@ ously met a v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of their di@@ sc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation ?
D@@ id they know who they were v@@ ot@@ ing against and what the imp@@ act was ?
"And then it oc@@ cur@@ red to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were ca@@ st@@ ing into secon@@ d@@ -@@ cl@@ ass ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ ship it might make it har@@ der for them to do ."
It might give them p@@ ause .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same d@@ in@@ ner par@@ ty , so I fi@@ gu@@ red out a way where I could int@@ ro@@ duce them to each other photograp@@ h@@ ically without any arti@@ f@@ ice , without any li@@ gh@@ ting , or without any man@@ i@@ p@@ ulation of any kind on my part ."
Because in a photograp@@ h you can exam@@ ine a li@@ on &apos;s wh@@ is@@ kers without the fe@@ ar of him ri@@ p@@ ping your face off .
"For me , photograp@@ h@@ y is not just about ex@@ pos@@ ing fil@@ m , it &apos;s about ex@@ pos@@ ing the vi@@ e@@ wer to something new , a place they ha@@ ven &apos;t g@@ one before , but most import@@ an@@ tly , to people that they might be af@@ ra@@ id of ."
"L@@ i@@ fe mag@@ a@@ z@@ ine int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed gener@@ ations of people to dist@@ ant , far@@ -@@ off cul@@ tures they never knew ex@@ ist@@ ed through pic@@ tures ."
"So I decided to make a ser@@ ies of very simple por@@ tra@@ its , m@@ u@@ g@@ sh@@ ots if you will ."
"And I basically decided to photograp@@ h any@@ one in this country that was not 100 percent stra@@ ight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a lim@@ it@@ less number of people ."
"( Laughter ) So this was a very large under@@ taking , and to do it we needed some help ."
"So I r@@ an out in the fre@@ e@@ zing co@@ ld , and I photograp@@ h@@ ed every single person that I knew that I could get to in F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary of about two years ago ."
"And I took those photograp@@ h@@ s , and I went to the H@@ R@@ C and I asked them for some help ."
And they fund@@ ed two wee@@ ks of sho@@ ot@@ ing in New York .
And then we made this .
"( Mus@@ ic ) V@@ ide@@ o : I &apos;m i@@ O T@@ il@@ le@@ t@@ t W@@ right , and I &apos;m an arti@@ st bor@@ n and ra@@ is@@ ed in New York C@@ ity . ( Mus@@ ic )"

My go@@ al is to show the hum@@ an@@ ity that ex@@ i@@ sts in every one of us through the sim@@ p@@ lic@@ ity of a face .

"A@@ l@@ most 8@@ 5@@ ,000 people wat@@ ched that video , and then they started e@@ ma@@ il@@ ing us from all over the country , as@@ king us to come to their to@@ w@@ ns and help them to show their fac@@ es ."
And a lot more people wanted to show their fac@@ es than I had an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated .
"So I changed my im@@ medi@@ ate go@@ al to 1@@ 0,000 fac@@ es ."
"That video was made in the sp@@ r@@ ing of 20@@ 11 , and as of today I have tra@@ v@@ el@@ ed to almost 20 cities and photograp@@ h@@ ed almost 2@@ ,000 people ."
"I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minut@@ e of just qui@@ et and have you just look at these fac@@ es because there is nothing that I can say that will ad@@ d to them ."
"Because if a picture is wor@@ th a thous@@ and words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary ."
"So after tra@@ v@@ eling and talking to people in places like O@@ k@@ la@@ h@@ om@@ a or sm@@ all@@ -@@ to@@ wn T@@ ex@@ as , we found e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence that the in@@ i@@ ti@@ al pre@@ m@@ ise was de@@ ad on ."

S@@ par@@ king em@@ pa@@ thy had become the bac@@ k@@ b@@ one of S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths .

"It pres@@ ents , not just the comple@@ x@@ i@@ ties found in a pro@@ c@@ es@@ sion of different human be@@ ings , but the comple@@ x@@ i@@ ties found within each individu@@ al person ."
"It wasn &apos;t that we had too many bo@@ x@@ es , it was that we had too few ."
"A@@ t some point I real@@ ized that my mis@@ sion to photograp@@ h &quot; &quot; g@@ ays &quot; &quot; was in@@ her@@ ently f@@ la@@ wed , because there were a million different s@@ ha@@ des of g@@ ay ."
"H@@ ere I was trying to help , and I had per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated the very thing I had sp@@ ent my life trying to av@@ o@@ id — yet another bo@@ x ."
A@@ t some point I ad@@ ded a question to the re@@ le@@ ase form that asked people to qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent g@@ ay .
And I wat@@ ched so many ex@@ ist@@ ential cri@@ ses un@@ f@@ old in front of me .
( Laughter ) P@@ e@@ ople didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been pres@@ ented with the op@@ tion before .
C@@ an you qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y your op@@ en@@ ness ?
"O@@ n@@ ce they got over the sho@@ c@@ k , though , by and large people op@@ ted for some@@ where between 7@@ 0 to 9@@ 5 percent or the 3 to 20 percent mar@@ ks ."
"O@@ f course , there were lots of people who op@@ ted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much lar@@ ger pro@@ por@@ tion of people id@@ enti@@ fi@@ ed as something that was much more n@@ u@@ anc@@ ed ."
I found that most people f@@ all on a spec@@ tr@@ um of what I have come to re@@ f@@ er to as &quot; &quot; Gre@@ y . &quot; &quot; Let me be cle@@ ar though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that pre@@ fer@@ ence doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
"And I am not even going to ad@@ dre@@ ss the issu@@ e of cho@@ ice vers@@ us bio@@ logical im@@ per@@ ative , because if any of you happen to be of the beli@@ e@@ f that se@@ x@@ ual ori@@ en@@ tation is a cho@@ ice , I inv@@ ite you to go out and try to be gre@@ y ."
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human be@@ ings are not on@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al .
"The most important thing to take from the per@@ cent@@ age system is this : If you have g@@ ay people over here and you have stra@@ ight people over here , and while we reco@@ gn@@ ize that most people id@@ enti@@ f@@ y as some@@ where clos@@ er to one b@@ in@@ ary or another , there is this v@@ ast spec@@ tr@@ um of people that ex@@ ist in between ."
And the reality that this pres@@ ents is a comp@@ lic@@ ated one .
"Because , for example , if you p@@ ass a la@@ w that allo@@ ws a b@@ oss to fir@@ e an emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e for h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ ual behavi@@ or , where exactly do you dra@@ w the line ?"
"I@@ s it over here , by the people who have had one or two he@@ ter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual experi@@ ences so far ?"
O@@ r is it over here by the people who have only had one or two h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ ual experi@@ ences th@@ us far ?
Wh@@ ere exactly does one become a secon@@ d@@ -@@ cl@@ ass ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ?
A@@ no@@ ther interesting thing that I learned from my project and my tra@@ v@@ els is just what a po@@ or b@@ in@@ ding ag@@ ent se@@ x@@ ual ori@@ en@@ tation is .
"A@@ f@@ ter tra@@ v@@ eling so much and me@@ e@@ ting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many j@@ er@@ ks and s@@ wee@@ the@@ ar@@ ts and D@@ emo@@ cr@@ ats and Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ ans and j@@ oc@@ ks and qu@@ e@@ ens and every other pol@@ ar@@ ization you can possi@@ bly think of within the L@@ G@@ B@@ T community as there are within the human r@@ ace ."
"A@@ side from the fact that we play with one le@@ g@@ al hand ti@@ ed behind our bac@@ ks , and once you get past the shar@@ ed n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive of pre@@ ju@@ d@@ ice and str@@ u@@ gg@@ le , just being other than stra@@ ight doesn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily mean that we have anything in common ."
"So in the end@@ less pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of fac@@ es that S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is always bec@@ om@@ ing , as it hop@@ e@@ fully appe@@ ar@@ s across more and more pl@@ at@@ for@@ ms , b@@ us sh@@ el@@ ters , b@@ ill@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , F@@ ace@@ book p@@ ages , scre@@ en sa@@ ver@@ s , perhaps in wat@@ ching this pro@@ c@@ es@@ sion of hum@@ an@@ ity , something interesting and us@@ e@@ ful will beg@@ in to happen ."
"H@@ op@@ e@@ fully these c@@ ate@@ g@@ or@@ ies , these b@@ in@@ ar@@ ies , these over@@ -@@ sim@@ p@@ li@@ fi@@ ed bo@@ x@@ es will beg@@ in to become us@@ el@@ ess and they &apos;ll beg@@ in to f@@ all away ."
"Because really , they des@@ cri@@ be nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are ."
What we see are human be@@ ings in all their mul@@ ti@@ p@@ lic@@ ity .
And seeing them makes it har@@ der to d@@ en@@ y their hum@@ an@@ ity .
A@@ t the very least I hope it makes it har@@ der to d@@ en@@ y their human ri@@ ghts .
"So is it me partic@@ ul@@ arly that you would cho@@ ose to d@@ en@@ y the right to h@@ ous@@ ing , the right to ad@@ op@@ t children , the right to mar@@ ri@@ age , the fre@@ e@@ dom to sho@@ p here , live here , bu@@ y here ?"
"A@@ m I the one that you cho@@ ose to di@@ so@@ wn as your child or your bro@@ ther or your si@@ ster or your mother or your father , your ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or , your c@@ ous@@ in , your un@@ cle , the pre@@ si@@ dent , your poli@@ ce woman or the fi@@ re@@ man ?"
It &apos;s too l@@ ate .
Because I already am all of those things .
"We already are all of those things , and we always have been ."
"So ple@@ ase don &apos;t gre@@ et us as str@@ ang@@ ers , gre@@ et us as your fel@@ low human be@@ ings , per@@ i@@ od ."

"In India and N@@ ep@@ al , I was int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed to the br@@ ick k@@ il@@ ns ."
This str@@ an@@ ge and aw@@ es@@ ome si@@ ght was like wal@@ king into anci@@ ent E@@ g@@ yp@@ t or D@@ an@@ te &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
"E@@ n@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed in tem@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res of 1@@ 30 de@@ gre@@ es , men , women , children , entire famili@@ es in fact , were c@@ lo@@ a@@ ked in a he@@ av@@ y bl@@ an@@ ket of d@@ ust , while m@@ ech@@ an@@ ically st@@ ac@@ king br@@ ic@@ ks on their head , up to 1@@ 8 at a time , and car@@ r@@ ying them from the sc@@ or@@ ching k@@ il@@ ns to tr@@ uc@@ ks hund@@ re@@ ds of y@@ ar@@ ds away ."
"D@@ e@@ ad@@ en@@ ed by mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y and ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion , they work sil@@ ently , doing this t@@ ask over and over for 1@@ 6 or 1@@ 7 hours a day ."
"There were no brea@@ ks for food , no water brea@@ ks , and the se@@ v@@ ere de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ con@@ sequ@@ ential ."
So per@@ v@@ as@@ ive was the he@@ at and the d@@ ust that my cam@@ er@@ a became too h@@ ot to even tou@@ ch and ce@@ as@@ ed working .
"E@@ very 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our c@@ ru@@ is@@ er to cle@@ an out my ge@@ ar and run it under an air con@@ di@@ tion@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it , and as I s@@ at there , I thought , my cam@@ er@@ a is getting far better tre@@ at@@ ment than these people ."
"B@@ ack in the k@@ il@@ ns , I wanted to cr@@ y , but the ab@@ o@@ li@@ tion@@ ist next to me quickly gr@@ ab@@ bed me and he said , &quot; &quot; L@@ is@@ a , don &apos;t do that .

I couldn &apos;t off@@ er them any direc@@ t help .
"I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing ."
I wasn &apos;t a ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en of that country .
I could get them in a wor@@ se sit@@ u@@ ation than they were already in .
"I &apos;d have to re@@ ly on F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves to work within the system for their li@@ ber@@ ation , and I tru@@ st@@ ed that they would ."
"As for me , I &apos;d have to wa@@ it until I got home to really feel my hear@@ t@@ bre@@ ak ."
"In the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as , I found children car@@ r@@ ying st@@ one for mil@@ es down m@@ oun@@ tain@@ ous ter@@ ra@@ in to tr@@ uc@@ ks wa@@ iting at ro@@ ads b@@ el@@ ow ."

It &apos;s difficult to w@@ it@@ ness something so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
"@@ How can we aff@@ ect something so in@@ si@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ v@@ as@@ ive ?"
"S@@ ome don &apos;t even know they &apos;re en@@ s@@ la@@ ved , people working 1@@ 6 , 1@@ 7 hours a day without any p@@ ay , because this has been the case all their lives ."
They have nothing to comp@@ are it to .
"When these v@@ ill@@ ag@@ ers cl@@ a@@ im@@ ed their fre@@ e@@ dom , the s@@ la@@ ve@@ hol@@ d@@ ers bur@@ ned down all of their h@@ ous@@ es ."
"I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so pe@@ tri@@ fi@@ ed , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the cen@@ ter r@@ al@@ li@@ ed for them to per@@ se@@ v@@ ere , and ab@@ o@@ li@@ tion@@ i@@ sts on the ground hel@@ ped them get a qu@@ ar@@ ry le@@ ase of their own , so that now they do the same bac@@ k@@ -@@ brea@@ king work , but they do it for themselves , and they get pa@@ id for it , and they do it in fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"S@@ e@@ x tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word s@@ la@@ very , and because of this wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work sa@@ fe@@ ly within this particular indu@@ stry ."
"In K@@ a@@ th@@ m@@ and@@ u , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had pre@@ vi@@ ously been se@@ x s@@ la@@ ves themselves ."
"They us@@ her@@ ed me down a n@@ ar@@ row set of sta@@ ir@@ s that led to this di@@ r@@ ty , di@@ m@@ ly flu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent l@@ it bas@@ ement ."
"This wasn &apos;t a bro@@ the@@ l , per se ."
It was more like a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant .
"C@@ ab@@ in re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ants , as they &apos;re known in the tra@@ de , are ven@@ ues for for@@ c@@ ed pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion ."
"E@@ ach has small , pri@@ v@@ ate ro@@ om@@ s , where the s@@ la@@ ves , women , along with young gir@@ ls and bo@@ ys , some as young as se@@ ven years old , are for@@ c@@ ed to en@@ ter@@ tain the c@@ li@@ ents , enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing them to bu@@ y more food and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ."
"E@@ ach cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le is dar@@ k and d@@ in@@ gy , id@@ enti@@ fi@@ ed with a pa@@ in@@ ted number on the w@@ all , and par@@ ti@@ tion@@ ed by pl@@ y@@ w@@ ood and a cur@@ tain ."
The wor@@ kers here often end@@ ure tra@@ gi@@ c se@@ x@@ ual ab@@ use at the h@@ ands of their cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers .
"S@@ t@@ anding in the ne@@ ar dar@@ k@@ ness , I remember fe@@ eling this qu@@ ick , h@@ ot fe@@ ar , and in that inst@@ ant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be tr@@ app@@ ed in that h@@ ell ."
I had only one way out : the sta@@ ir@@ s from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back do@@ ors .
There were no win@@ do@@ ws large enough to clim@@ b through .
"Th@@ ese people have no es@@ cap@@ e at all , and as we take in such a difficult sub@@ ject , it &apos;s important to n@@ ote that s@@ la@@ very , inclu@@ ding se@@ x tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king , oc@@ cur@@ s in our own bac@@ k@@ y@@ ard as well ."
"T@@ ens of hund@@ re@@ ds of people are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , in re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ants , in d@@ om@@ es@@ tic serv@@ it@@ u@@ de , and the li@@ st can go on ."

It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The t@@ ex@@ ti@@ le indu@@ stry is another one we often think of when we hear about s@@ la@@ ve l@@ ab@@ or .
I vi@@ s@@ ited v@@ ill@@ ages in India where entire famili@@ es were en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in the sil@@ k tra@@ de .
This is a family por@@ tra@@ it .
"The d@@ y@@ ed black h@@ ands are the father , while the bl@@ ue and red h@@ ands are his s@@ ons ."
"They mi@@ x d@@ y@@ e in these big bar@@ re@@ ls , and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the sil@@ k into the li@@ qu@@ id up to their el@@ bo@@ ws , but the d@@ y@@ e is to@@ x@@ ic ."
My inter@@ pre@@ ter told me their stories .
"&quot; &quot; We have no fre@@ e@@ dom , &quot; &quot; they said ."
"&quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get pa@@ id for our d@@ ye@@ ing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s es@@ tim@@ ated that more than 4@@ ,000 children are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved on L@@ ake V@@ ol@@ t@@ a , the lar@@ g@@ est man@@ -@@ made la@@ ke in the world ."
"When we first ar@@ ri@@ ved , I went to have a qu@@ ick look ."
"I saw what se@@ em@@ ed to be a family fi@@ sh@@ ing on a bo@@ at , two ol@@ der bro@@ thers , some youn@@ ger kids , makes sense right ?"
W@@ r@@ ong . They were all en@@ s@@ la@@ ved .
"@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren are taken from their famili@@ es and tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ ked and v@@ an@@ i@@ shed , and they &apos;re for@@ c@@ ed to work end@@ less hours on these bo@@ ats on the la@@ ke , even though they do not know how to s@@ wi@@ m ."
This young child is e@@ ight years old .
"He was tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ing when our bo@@ at appro@@ ach@@ ed , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed it would run over his tin@@ y can@@ o@@ e ."
He was pe@@ tri@@ fi@@ ed he would be kno@@ c@@ ked in the water .

"@@ in the co@@ ld , win@@ dy night ."
And it &apos;s important to n@@ ote that these ne@@ ts we@@ i@@ gh more than a thous@@ and p@@ ounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to int@@ ro@@ duce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was re@@ sc@@ u@@ ed from a fi@@ sh@@ ing v@@ ill@@ age .

K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of possi@@ bility .
Wh@@ o will he become because someone took a st@@ and and made a difference in his life ?

He told us to fol@@ low him down a di@@ r@@ t ro@@ ad into the j@@ un@@ gle .

"M@@ any women had children str@@ app@@ ed to their bac@@ ks while they were p@@ an@@ ning for go@@ ld , w@@ ad@@ ing in water po@@ is@@ on@@ ed by mer@@ cur@@ y ."

"But mo@@ der@@ n@@ ization actually b@@ rou@@ ght communic@@ ation and a whole new materi@@ al , in the form of t@@ ele@@ phone w@@ ire ."
R@@ ural to ur@@ b@@ an m@@ ig@@ ra@@ tion me@@ ant that ne@@ w@@ found indu@@ stri@@ al materi@@ als started to re@@ place har@@ d@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ com@@ e-@@ by natural gr@@ ass@@ es .
"So , here you can see the change from use — star@@ ting to use cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary materi@@ als ."
These piec@@ es d@@ ate back from the &apos; 4@@ 0s to the l@@ ate &apos; 5@@ 0s .
"In the &apos; 9@@ 0s , my inter@@ est and p@@ as@@ sion for tran@@ si@@ tional art for@@ ms led me to a new form , which came from a s@@ qu@@ at@@ ter cam@@ p outside D@@ ur@@ b@@ an ."
"And I got the opport@@ un@@ ity to start working with this community at that point , and started develop@@ ing , really , and m@@ ent@@ or@@ ing them in terms of scale , in terms of the design ."
And the project so@@ on gre@@ w from five to 50 we@@ a@@ ver@@ s in about a year .
"S@@ o@@ on we had out@@ gro@@ wn the sc@@ ra@@ p y@@ ar@@ ds , what they could provi@@ de , so we co@@ er@@ c@@ ed a w@@ ire man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ re@@ r to help us , and not only to sup@@ ply the materi@@ als on bo@@ b@@ b@@ ins , but to pro@@ duce to our col@@ or speci@@ fic@@ ations ."
"A@@ t the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possi@@ bility here to pro@@ duce cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary produc@@ ts , away from the e@@ th@@ n@@ ic , a little bit more cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary ."
So I develop@@ ed a whole ran@@ ge around — m@@ ass@@ -@@ produc@@ ed ran@@ ge — that obvi@@ ously f@@ it@@ ted into a much high@@ er@@ -@@ end dec@@ or market that could be ex@@ por@@ ted and also serv@@ ice our local market .
"We started experim@@ en@@ ting , as you can see , in terms of sh@@ ap@@ es , for@@ ms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pe@@ t project . It &apos;s suc@@ cess@@ ful , it &apos;s been run@@ ning for 12 years . And we sup@@ ply the Con@@ r@@ an sh@@ op@@ s , and D@@ on@@ n@@ a K@@ ar@@ an , and so it &apos;s kind of great ."
"This is our group , our ma@@ in group of we@@ a@@ ver@@ s ."
They come on a wee@@ k@@ ly bas@@ is to D@@ ur@@ b@@ an .
They all have b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts .
They &apos;ve all mo@@ ved back to the r@@ ural area where they came from .
It &apos;s a wee@@ k@@ ly tur@@ n@@ around of produc@@ tion .
This is the community that I or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally sho@@ wed you the sli@@ de of .
"And that &apos;s also mo@@ der@@ n@@ ized today , and it &apos;s sup@@ por@@ ting work for 3@@ 00 we@@ a@@ ver@@ s ."
And the rest says it all .
Thank you very much .

"In an age of global stri@@ fe and clim@@ ate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is se@@ x so d@@ am@@ n good ?"
"If you &apos;re l@@ augh@@ ing , you know what I mean ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s why . B@@ ack in uni@@ versity , we had a qu@@ ick project to design some sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed c@@ loc@@ ks ."
Here &apos;s my c@@ loc@@ k .
"It uses something called the d@@ war@@ f s@@ un@@ flo@@ wer , which gro@@ ws to about 12 in@@ ch@@ es in he@@ ight ."
"Now , as you know , s@@ un@@ flo@@ w@@ ers tr@@ ack the su@@ n during the course of the day ."
"So in the mor@@ ning , you see which direc@@ tion the s@@ un@@ flo@@ wer is fac@@ ing , and you mar@@ k it on the bl@@ ank area in the b@@ ase ."
"A@@ t no@@ on , you mar@@ k the changed posi@@ tion of the s@@ un@@ flo@@ wer , and in the ev@@ ening again , and that &apos;s your c@@ loc@@ k ."
"Now , I know my c@@ loc@@ k doesn &apos;t tell you the ex@@ act time , but it does give you a gener@@ al idea using a flo@@ wer ."
"So , in my completely un@@ bi@@ as@@ ed , sub@@ jec@@ tive op@@ in@@ ion , it &apos;s br@@ illi@@ ant ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , here &apos;s Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ loc@@ k ."
It &apos;s five mag@@ ni@@ f@@ ying gl@@ ass@@ es with a sho@@ t gl@@ ass under each one .
In each sho@@ t gl@@ ass is a different sc@@ ented oil .
"In the mor@@ ning , the s@@ un@@ light will sh@@ ine down on the first mag@@ ni@@ f@@ ying gl@@ ass , foc@@ using a be@@ am of light on the sho@@ t gl@@ ass under@@ ne@@ ath ."
"This will war@@ m up the sc@@ ented oil inside , and a particular sm@@ ell will be em@@ it@@ ted ."
"So during the course of the day , five different sm@@ ells are dis@@ per@@ sed throu@@ gh@@ out that environment ."
An@@ y@@ one living in that house can tell the time just by the sm@@ ell .
You can see why I h@@ ate Ch@@ r@@ is .
One thing you have to know about me is I h@@ ate to l@@ ose .
This problem &apos;s been bu@@ gg@@ ing me for well over a decad@@ e .
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why se@@ x is so good ."
"M@@ any years after the sol@@ ar power@@ ed c@@ loc@@ ks project , a young l@@ ad@@ y I knew su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ed maybe se@@ x is so good because of the five sen@@ ses ."
"And when she said this , I had an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any ."
So I decided to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate different experi@@ ences I had in my life from the point of view of the five sen@@ ses .
"T@@ o do this , I de@@ vi@@ sed something called the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h ."
"A@@ long the y-@@ a@@ x@@ is , you have a scale from z@@ er@@ o to 10 , and along the x@@ -@@ a@@ x@@ is , you have , of course , the five sen@@ ses ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ time I had a mem@@ or@@ able experience in my life , I would rec@@ ord it on this grap@@ h like a five sen@@ ses di@@ ary ."
Here &apos;s a qu@@ ick video to show you how it works .
"B@@ i@@ ke desig@@ ner : This is &#91; un@@ cle@@ ar &#93; , cu@@ st@@ om bi@@ ke desig@@ ner ."
( M@@ ot@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ le re@@ v@@ ving ) &#91; S@@ ound &#93; &#91; T@@ ou@@ ch &#93; &#91; S@@ ight &#93; &#91; S@@ m@@ ell &#93; &#91; T@@ ast@@ e &#93; J@@ L : And that &apos;s how the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h works .
So here are some other res@@ ul@@ ts .
The first is for inst@@ ant no@@ o@@ d@@ les .
"Now obvi@@ ously , ta@@ st@@ e and sm@@ ell are quite high , but no@@ tice sound is at three ."
"You know . ( S@@ l@@ ur@@ ps ) N@@ e@@ ed@@ less to say , I no longer d@@ ine with these people ."
"O@@ K , next , clu@@ b@@ b@@ ing ."
These people I still do h@@ an@@ g out with .
"A@@ ll right , and s@@ mo@@ king ."
"H@@ ere I found tou@@ ch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reas@@ ons is that s@@ mo@@ kers told me the sen@@ sa@@ tion of hol@@ ding a ci@@ g@@ ar@@ et@@ te and br@@ ing@@ ing it up to your li@@ ps is a big part of the s@@ mo@@ king experience , which sho@@ ws , it &apos;s kind of sc@@ ary to think how well ci@@ g@@ ar@@ et@@ t@@ es are desig@@ ned by the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers ."
"O@@ K . Now , what would the per@@ f@@ ect experience look like on the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h ?"
"It would , of course , be a hor@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ al line along the top ."
"Now you can see , not even as in@@ ten@@ se an experience as ri@@ ding a m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke comes close ."
"In fact , in the years that I ga@@ ther@@ ed data , only one experience came close to being the per@@ f@@ ect one ."
"That is , of course , se@@ x . Gre@@ at se@@ x ."
R@@ es@@ p@@ on@@ d@@ ents said that great se@@ x h@@ its all of the five sen@@ ses at an extre@@ me level .
So the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory does help expl@@ ain why se@@ x is so good .
"Now in the middle of all this five sen@@ ses work , I su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed the sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed c@@ loc@@ ks project from my y@@ outh ."
And I real@@ ized this the@@ ory also expl@@ a@@ ins why Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ loc@@ k is so much better than m@@ ine .
"You see , my c@@ loc@@ k only foc@@ uses on si@@ ght , and a little bit of tou@@ ch ."
Here &apos;s Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ loc@@ k .
It &apos;s the first c@@ loc@@ k ever that uses sm@@ ell to tell the time .
"In fact , in terms of the five sen@@ ses , Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ loc@@ k is a re@@ vol@@ ution ."
And that &apos;s what this the@@ ory ta@@ u@@ ght me about my fiel@@ d .
"You see , up ti@@ ll now , us desig@@ n@@ ers , we &apos;ve ma@@ in@@ ly foc@@ used on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of tou@@ ch , which means we &apos;ve ig@@ no@@ red the other three sen@@ ses ."
Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ loc@@ k sho@@ ws us that even ra@@ is@@ ing just one of those other sen@@ ses can make for a br@@ illi@@ ant produc@@ t .
So what if we started using the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory in all of our desig@@ ns ?
Here &apos;s three qu@@ ick ideas I came up with .
"We could call this &quot; &quot; the per@@ f@@ um@@ ator . &quot; &quot; A@@ ll right , next ."
"So I br@@ us@@ h my te@@ e@@ th tw@@ ice a day , and what if we had a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h that ta@@ st@@ es like can@@ dy , and when the ta@@ st@@ e of can@@ dy r@@ an out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h ?"
"F@@ in@@ ally , I have a thing for the ke@@ ys on a fl@@ ut@@ e or a cl@@ ar@@ in@@ et ."
"It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you pres@@ s down on them ."
"Now , I don &apos;t play the fl@@ ut@@ e or the cl@@ ar@@ in@@ et , so I decided to com@@ b@@ ine these ke@@ ys with an in@@ str@@ um@@ ent I do play : the t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion re@@ m@@ ote control ."
"Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll no@@ tice that the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these produc@@ ts but also the way they look ."
"Now , I real@@ ize the five sen@@ ses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting ."
There &apos;s also the six emo@@ tions and that el@@ us@@ ive x@@ -@@ fac@@ tor .
M@@ ay@@ be that could be the t@@ op@@ ic of my next talk .
"@@ Un@@ til then , ple@@ ase have fu@@ n using the five sen@@ ses in your own lives and your own desig@@ ns ."
"O@@ h , one last thing before I leave ."
And the best way to do that is with free can@@ dy .
You guys ready ?
A@@ ll right .
( Applause )
"When I was six years old , I re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved my gi@@ f@@ ts ."
My first gra@@ de te@@ ac@@ her had this br@@ illi@@ ant idea .
She wanted us to experience re@@ ce@@ i@@ ving gi@@ f@@ ts but also learning the vir@@ tu@@ e of comp@@ lim@@ en@@ ting each other .
"So she had all of us come to the front of the cl@@ ass@@ room , and she b@@ ou@@ ght all of us gi@@ f@@ ts and st@@ ac@@ ked them in the cor@@ ner ."
"And she said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we just st@@ and here and comp@@ li@@ ment each other ?"
"If you hear your name called , go and pic@@ k up your gi@@ ft and s@@ it down . &quot; &quot; What a wonderful idea , right ?"
What could go wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Well , there were 40 of us to start with , and every time I heard someone &apos;s name called , I would give out the hear@@ ti@@ est che@@ er ."
"And then there were 20 people left , and 10 people left , and five left ..@@ ."
and three left .
And I was one of them .
And the comp@@ lim@@ ents st@@ op@@ ped .
"Well , at that moment , I was cr@@ ying ."
And the te@@ ac@@ her was fre@@ a@@ king out .
"S@@ he was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , would any@@ one say anything n@@ ice about these people ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; No one ? OK , why don &apos;t you go get your gi@@ ft and s@@ it down ."
But I don &apos;t know who felt wor@@ se that day .
W@@ as it me or the te@@ ac@@ her ?
She must have real@@ ized that she turned a te@@ am@@ -@@ building ev@@ ent into a public ro@@ ast for three si@@ x@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds .
And without the hum@@ or .
"You know , when you see people get ro@@ ast@@ ed on T@@ V , it was fun@@ n@@ y ."
There was nothing fun@@ n@@ y about that day .
"So that was one ver@@ sion of me , and I would di@@ e to av@@ o@@ id being in that sit@@ u@@ ation again — to get re@@ jec@@ ted in public again ."
That &apos;s one ver@@ sion .
Th@@ en fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ ward e@@ ight years .
"B@@ ill G@@ ates came to my h@@ ome@@ to@@ wn — B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , China — to spe@@ ak , and I saw his mess@@ age ."
I f@@ ell in love with that guy .
"I thought , w@@ ow , I know what I want to do now ."
"That night I wr@@ ote a le@@ tter to my family t@@ elling them : &quot; &quot; B@@ y age 25 , I will build the bi@@ gg@@ est company in the world , and that company will bu@@ y M@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ o@@ ft . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I t@@ ot@@ ally em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed this idea of con@@ qu@@ ering the world — d@@ om@@ in@@ ation , right ?"
"And I didn &apos;t make this up , I did wr@@ ite that le@@ tter ."
"And here it is — ( Laughter ) You don &apos;t have to read this through — ( Laughter ) This is also bad h@@ and@@ wr@@ iting , but I did high@@ light some key words ."
You get the idea .
( Laughter ) So ...
that was another ver@@ sion of me : one who will con@@ qu@@ er the world .
"Well , then two years later , I was pres@@ ented with the opport@@ un@@ ity to come to the United States ."
"I j@@ um@@ ped on it , because that was where B@@ ill G@@ ates li@@ ved , right ?"
( Laughter ) I thought that was the start of my ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur jour@@ ney .
"Th@@ en , fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ ward another 1@@ 4 years ."
I was 30 .
"N@@ op@@ e , I didn &apos;t build that company ."
I didn &apos;t even start .
I was actually a mar@@ ke@@ ting manag@@ er for a F@@ or@@ tun@@ e 500 company .
And I felt I was st@@ uc@@ k ; I was st@@ ag@@ n@@ ant .
Why is that ?
Wh@@ ere is that 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old who wr@@ ote that le@@ tter ?
It &apos;s not because he didn &apos;t try .
One wanted to con@@ qu@@ er the world — make a difference — another was af@@ ra@@ id of re@@ jec@@ tion .
And every time that si@@ x@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old won .
And this fe@@ ar even per@@ si@@ st@@ ed after I started my own company .
"I mean , I started my own company when I was 30 — if you want to be B@@ ill G@@ ates , you &apos;ve got to start so@@ on@@ er or later , right ?"
"When I was an ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur , I was pres@@ ented with an inv@@ est@@ ment opport@@ un@@ ity , and then I was turned down ."
And that re@@ jec@@ tion h@@ ur@@ t me .
It h@@ ur@@ t me so bad that I wanted to qu@@ it right there .
"But then I thought , h@@ ey , would B@@ ill G@@ ates qu@@ it after a simple inv@@ est@@ ment re@@ jec@@ tion ?"
W@@ ould any suc@@ cess@@ ful ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur qu@@ it like that ?
No way .
And this is where it c@@ lic@@ ked for me .
"O@@ K , I can build a better company ."
"I can build a better team or better produc@@ t , but one thing for sure : I &apos;ve got to be a better lead@@ er ."
I &apos;ve got to be a better person .
I can@@ not let that si@@ x@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old keep dic@@ t@@ ating my life any@@ more .
I have to put him back in his place .
So this is where I went on@@ line and looked for help .
Google was my friend .
"( Laughter ) I sear@@ ched , &quot; &quot; How do I over@@ come the fe@@ ar of re@@ jec@@ tion ? &quot; &quot; I came up with a b@@ un@@ ch of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logy ar@@ tic@@ les about where the fe@@ ar and pa@@ in are coming from ."
"Th@@ en I came up with a b@@ un@@ ch of &quot; &quot; ra@@ h@@ -@@ ra@@ h &quot; &quot; in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tional ar@@ tic@@ les about &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t take it person@@ ally , just over@@ come it . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o doesn &apos;t know that ?"
( Laughter ) But why was I still so sc@@ ar@@ ed ?
Th@@ en I found this we@@ b@@ s@@ ite by l@@ uc@@ k .
H@@ is name is J@@ as@@ on C@@ om@@ ely .
"And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for re@@ jec@@ tion , and every day get re@@ jec@@ ted at something , and then by the end , you des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ ze y@@ our@@ self from the pa@@ in ."
And I lo@@ ved that idea .
"( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? I &apos;m going to do this ."
And so here &apos;s what I did .
This is what the b@@ lo@@ g looked like .
D@@ ay One ...
( Laughter ) B@@ or@@ row 100 dollars from a str@@ an@@ ger .
So this is where I went to where I was working .
I came do@@ w@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s and I saw this big guy sit@@ ting behind a des@@ k .
He looked like a sec@@ ur@@ ity gu@@ ard .
So I just appro@@ ach@@ ed him .
"And I was just wal@@ king and that was the lon@@ g@@ est walk of my life — ha@@ ir on the back of my nec@@ k st@@ anding up , I was s@@ we@@ ating and my heart was p@@ oun@@ ding ."
"( Laughter ) And he looked up , he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot;"
"And I just said , &quot; &quot; No ? I &apos;m sor@@ ry . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I turned around , and I just r@@ an ."
( Laughter ) I felt so em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ed .
"But because I fil@@ m@@ ed myself — so that night I was wat@@ ching myself getting re@@ jec@@ ted , I just saw how sc@@ ar@@ ed I was ."
I looked like this k@@ id in &quot; &quot; The S@@ i@@ x@@ th S@@ en@@ se . &quot; &quot; I saw de@@ ad people .
( Laughter ) But then I saw this guy .
"You know , he wasn &apos;t that men@@ ac@@ ing ."
"He was a ch@@ u@@ b@@ by , lo@@ ve@@ able guy , and he even asked me , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; In fact , he inv@@ ited me to expl@@ ain myself ."
And I could &apos;ve said many things .
"I could &apos;ve expl@@ ain@@ ed , I could &apos;ve ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ated ."
I didn &apos;t do any of that .
A@@ ll I did was run .
"I felt , w@@ ow , this is like a micro@@ cos@@ m of my life ."
"E@@ very time I felt the sli@@ gh@@ test re@@ jec@@ tion , I would just run as f@@ ast as I could ."
And you know what ?
"The next day , no matter what happens , I &apos;m not going to run ."
I &apos;ll st@@ ay eng@@ ag@@ ed .
"D@@ ay T@@ w@@ o : R@@ equ@@ est a &quot; &quot; bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s when I went to a bur@@ ger jo@@ int , I fin@@ i@@ shed l@@ un@@ ch , and I went to the c@@ as@@ hi@@ er and said , &quot; H@@ i , can I get a bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill ? &quot; ( Laughter )"
"He was all conf@@ used , like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s just like a dr@@ ink re@@ f@@ ill but with a bur@@ ger . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ or@@ ry , we don &apos;t do bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill , man . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So this is where re@@ jec@@ tion happened and I could have run , but I st@@ ay@@ ed ."
"And by the way , I don &apos;t think they &apos;ve ever done bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill ."
( Laughter ) I think they &apos;re still there .
"But the life and de@@ ath fe@@ eling I was fe@@ eling the first time was no longer there , just because I st@@ ay@@ ed eng@@ ag@@ ed — because I didn &apos;t run ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , great , I &apos;m already learning things ."
This is where my life was turned up@@ side down .
I went to a K@@ ri@@ sp@@ y K@@ re@@ me .
"I &apos;m sure they have some here , too ."
"And I went in , I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you make me d@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ u@@ ts that look like O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ ic sym@@ b@@ ols ?"
"B@@ as@@ ically , you inter@@ l@@ ink five d@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ u@@ ts together ... &quot; &quot; I mean there &apos;s no way they could say y@@ es , right ?"
The d@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut ma@@ ker took me so ser@@ i@@ ously .
"( Laughter ) So she put out p@@ aper , started j@@ ot@@ ting down the col@@ ors and the r@@ ings , and is like , &quot; &quot; How can I make this ? &quot; &quot; And then 15 minutes later , she came out with a bo@@ x that looked like O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ ic r@@ ings ."
And I was so tou@@ ched .
I just couldn &apos;t believe it .
And that video got over five million vi@@ e@@ ws on Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be .
The world couldn &apos;t believe that ei@@ ther .
"( Laughter ) You know , because of that I was in ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers , in talk sho@@ ws , in everything ."
And I became fam@@ ous .
"A lot of people started wr@@ iting e@@ ma@@ il@@ s to me and saying , &quot; &quot; What you &apos;re doing is aw@@ es@@ ome . &quot; &quot; But you know , f@@ ame and n@@ ot@@ ori@@ ety did not do anything to me ."
"What I really wanted to do was learn , and to change myself ."
So I turned the rest of my 100 days of re@@ jec@@ tion into this play@@ ground — into this research project .
I wanted to see what I could learn .
I disco@@ vered so many sec@@ re@@ ts .
"( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; But before he could leave I said , &quot; H@@ ey , can I know why ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I have this do@@ g that would di@@ g up anything I put in the bac@@ k@@ y@@ ard ."
I don &apos;t want to wa@@ st@@ e your flo@@ wer .
"If you want to do this , go across the stre@@ et and talk to Con@@ ni@@ e ."
She lo@@ ves flo@@ w@@ ers . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
I went across and kno@@ c@@ ked on Con@@ ni@@ e &apos;s do@@ or .
And she was so happy to see me .
"( Laughter ) And then half an h@@ our later , there was this flo@@ wer in Con@@ ni@@ e &apos;s bac@@ k@@ y@@ ard ."
I &apos;m sure it looks better now .
It was n@@ one of those .
It was because what I off@@ er@@ ed did not f@@ it what he wanted .
I conver@@ ted a re@@ fer@@ r@@ al .
"And he was like , &quot; &quot; Oh &quot; &quot; — ye@@ a@@ h , this is how he looked , his name is E@@ ri@@ c — and he was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; This is how he was hear@@ ing me . &quot; &quot; N@@ ot sure . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I ask him , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that we@@ ird ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s really we@@ ird , man . &quot; &quot; But as so@@ on as he said that , his whole de@@ me@@ an@@ or changed ."
It &apos;s as if he &apos;s p@@ ut@@ ting all the d@@ ou@@ b@@ t on the flo@@ or .
"I said &quot; &quot; h@@ i &quot; &quot; to every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er that wal@@ ked in , and gave them ho@@ li@@ day che@@ ers ."
"B@@ y the way , I don &apos;t know what your care@@ er tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory is , don &apos;t be a gre@@ e@@ ter ."
"But then I found I could do this because I men@@ tion@@ ed , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that we@@ ird ? &quot; &quot; I men@@ tion@@ ed the d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that he was having ."
"And because I men@@ tion@@ ed , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that we@@ ird ? &quot; &quot; , that means I wasn &apos;t we@@ ird ."
"That means I was actually thinking just like him , seeing this as a we@@ ird thing ."
P@@ e@@ ople were more li@@ ke@@ ly to say y@@ es to me .
And then I learned I could ful@@ f@@ ill my life dre@@ am ...
by as@@ king .
But because I didn &apos;t run — I ke@@ pt doing it — and on the third try the prof@@ ess@@ or was very im@@ pres@@ sed .
"He said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I can use this ."
Why don &apos;t you come back in two months ? I &apos;ll f@@ it you in my curr@@ ic@@ ul@@ um . &quot; &quot; And two months later I was te@@ ach@@ ing a cl@@ ass .
"This is me — you probably can &apos;t see , this is a bad picture ."
"You know , sometimes you get re@@ jec@@ ted by li@@ gh@@ ting , you know ?"
"And in that picture , which you can &apos;t see , I quot@@ ed Mar@@ ti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world , who change the way we live and the way we think , are the people who were met with in@@ i@@ ti@@ al and often viol@@ ent re@@ jec@@ tions ."
"P@@ e@@ ople like Mar@@ ti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r . , like M@@ a@@ h@@ at@@ m@@ a G@@ and@@ h@@ i , N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ el@@ a , or even J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ ri@@ st ."
These people did not let re@@ jec@@ tion de@@ f@@ ine them .
They let their own re@@ action after re@@ jec@@ tion de@@ f@@ ine themselves .
And they em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed re@@ jec@@ tion .
"And we don &apos;t have to be those people to learn about re@@ jec@@ tion , and in my case , re@@ jec@@ tion was my cur@@ se , was my bo@@ o@@ ge@@ y@@ man ."
It has bo@@ ther@@ ed me my whole life because I was run@@ ning away from it .
Th@@ en I started em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing it .
I turned that into the bi@@ gg@@ est gi@@ ft in my life .
I started te@@ ach@@ ing people how to turn re@@ jec@@ tions into opport@@ uni@@ ties .

So I gu@@ ess I was the l@@ uc@@ k@@ y one .
My mother had 1@@ 6 pre@@ gn@@ anci@@ es .
"F@@ rom 1@@ 6 pre@@ gn@@ anci@@ es , five of us are ali@@ ve ."
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
I wanted to be a doc@@ tor to help women and children .
"So I comple@@ ted my education , but I wanted to go to uni@@ versity ."
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a d@@ orm@@ it@@ ory for gir@@ ls , so I was ac@@ cep@@ ted in me@@ d@@ ical school , but I could not go there ."
"So as a res@@ ult , my father s@@ ent me to America ."
I came to America .
I comple@@ ted my education .
"Wh@@ ile I was comple@@ ting my education , my country was inv@@ ad@@ ed by R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
"And do you know that at the time I was comple@@ ting my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country ."
"There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it ."
My family was in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p .
"So as so@@ on as I comple@@ ted my education , I b@@ rou@@ ght my family to America ."
I wanted them to be sa@@ fe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an .
"D@@ ay after day , when I list@@ en@@ ed to the news , when I fol@@ lo@@ wed what was going on with my country , my heart was brea@@ king up ."
"I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me ."
I had a good job .
I was a prof@@ ess@@ or at a uni@@ versity .
I ear@@ ned good money .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
But I wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back home .
So I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p .
"And when I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an , there were 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es . 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
"A@@ b@@ out 9@@ 0 percent of them were women and children . M@@ ost of the men have been kill@@ ed or they were in war . And you know , in the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p ,"
"@@ when I went d@@ ay@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day to do a sur@@ v@@ ey , I found things you never could imagine ."
I saw a wi@@ d@@ ow with five to e@@ ight children sit@@ ting there and we@@ ep@@ ing and not kno@@ wing what to do .
"I saw a young woman have no way to go any@@ where , no education , no en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , no place to even live ."
"I saw young men that had l@@ ost their father and their home , and they are sup@@ por@@ ting the family as a 1@@ 0-@@ to@@ -@@ 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year old bo@@ y — being the head of the h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ old , trying to prot@@ ect their si@@ ster and their mother and their children ."
So it was a very dev@@ ast@@ ating sit@@ u@@ ation .
"M@@ y heart was be@@ ating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do ."
"A@@ t that moment , we talk about mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m ."
"A@@ t that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?"
How could I help these people ?
I am one individu@@ al . What can I do for them ?
"But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life ."
It trans@@ form@@ ed me . It gave me st@@ at@@ us .
It gave me con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence . It gave me a care@@ er .
"It hel@@ ped me to sup@@ port my family , to bring my family to another country , to be sa@@ fe ."
"And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after ."
But do you think it was easy ?
"@@ No , because at that time , education was ban@@ ned for gir@@ ls , completely ."
"And also , by R@@ us@@ si@@ a inv@@ ad@@ ing A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , people were not tru@@ st@@ ing any@@ one ."
"It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o am I ?"
S@@ ome@@ body who comes from the United States .
S@@ ome@@ body who got educ@@ ated here .
D@@ id they tr@@ ust me ? O@@ f course not .
So I really needed to build the tr@@ ust in this community .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and sur@@ v@@ ey@@ ed and looked and looked .
I asked .
"F@@ in@@ ally , I found one man ."
He was 80 years old .
He was a mul@@ la@@ h .
"I went to his t@@ ent in the cam@@ p , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a te@@ ac@@ her . &quot;"
"And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ z@@ y woman , cra@@ z@@ y woman , how do you think I can be a te@@ ac@@ her ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a te@@ ac@@ her . &quot; &quot; F@@ in@@ ally , he ac@@ cep@@ ted my off@@ er , and once I started a cl@@ ass in his comp@@ ound , the word sp@@ read all over ."
"In a matter of one year , we had 25 s@@ cho@@ ols set up , 1@@ 5@@ ,000 children going to school , and it was amazing ."
"But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were gi@@ ving te@@ ac@@ her tra@@ ining . We were tra@@ ining women &apos;s ri@@ ghts , human ri@@ ghts , demo@@ cr@@ acy , ru@@ le of la@@ w . We were gi@@ ving all kinds of tra@@ ining . And one day , I tell you ,"
"@@ one day I was in the off@@ ice in P@@ es@@ ha@@ war , P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"A@@ ll of a su@@ dd@@ en , I saw my sta@@ ff run@@ ning to ro@@ om@@ s and loc@@ king the do@@ ors and t@@ elling me , &quot; &quot; R@@ u@@ n away , hi@@ de ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a lead@@ er , what do you do ?"
You &apos;re sc@@ ar@@ ed . You know it &apos;s d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
You know your life is on the line .
"But as a lead@@ er , you have to h@@ old it together ."
You have to h@@ old it together and show str@@ eng@@ th .
"So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were p@@ our@@ ing into my off@@ ice ."
So I inv@@ ited them to the off@@ ice .
"They came , and there were n@@ ine of them — n@@ ine T@@ ali@@ b@@ an ."
And I inv@@ ited them to have a se@@ at and have te@@ a .
They said no . They are not going to dr@@ ink te@@ a .
"And of course , with the t@@ one of vo@@ ice they were using , it was very sc@@ ary , but I was really s@@ ha@@ king up ."
"But also I was str@@ ong , hol@@ ding myself up ."
"And , of course , by that time , you know how I dre@@ ss — I dre@@ ss from head to to@@ e in a black hi@@ j@@ a@@ b ."
"The only thing you could see , my eyes ."
"They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?"
D@@ on &apos;t you know that school is ban@@ ned for gir@@ ls ?
"What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? Wh@@ ere is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are te@@ ach@@ ing gir@@ ls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody ."
"We have some students coming , and they are all learning K@@ or@@ an , H@@ o@@ ly B@@ ook ."
"They tal@@ ked to each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go , leave her al@@ one , she &apos;s OK . &quot; &quot; And you know , this time , I off@@ er@@ ed them te@@ a again , and they took a si@@ p and they left ."
"B@@ y that time , my sta@@ ff p@@ ou@@ red into my off@@ ice ."
They were sc@@ ar@@ ed to de@@ ath .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t k@@ ill me .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
But everybody was happy to see me .
"@@ V@@ ery happy , and I was happy to be ali@@ ve , of course ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ f course , I was happy to be ali@@ ve ."
"W@@ ith the f@@ all of the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , we went into the country , and we op@@ en@@ ed school after school ."
We op@@ en@@ ed women &apos;s learning cen@@ ter .
We contin@@ u@@ ously op@@ en@@ ed cl@@ in@@ ics .
We worked with mo@@ thers and children .
I was very happy . I was deli@@ gh@@ ted with the out@@ come of my work .
"And one day , with four tra@@ in@@ ers and one bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard , I was going up n@@ or@@ th of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l , and all of a su@@ dd@@ en , again , I was st@@ op@@ ped in the middle of the ro@@ ad by 1@@ 9 young men ."
"@@ R@@ i@@ fl@@ es on their sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ ers , they b@@ loc@@ ked the ro@@ ad ."
"I am very s@@ ha@@ ken up , and I told myself , this is it ."
"This time , we all are going to be kill@@ ed ."
There is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t in my mind .
"But still , the moment comes , and you take str@@ eng@@ th from what@@ ever you believe and what@@ ever you do ."
It &apos;s in your heart .
So I just h@@ old myself on the side of the car .
"M@@ y le@@ g was s@@ ha@@ king , and I got outside ."
"And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?"
"They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are ."
We know where you are going .
E@@ very day you go up n@@ or@@ th here and there .
"You build their sk@@ ill@@ s . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?"
That &apos;s all we know . &quot; &quot; And you know what that means .
"It &apos;s a tra@@ p to me , of course ."
"So I walk out of there . They said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go , go . &quot; &quot; And so I wal@@ ked into the car , I s@@ it in the car , and I told the dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; T@@ ur@@ n around and go back to the off@@ ice . &quot; &quot; A@@ t that time , we only were sup@@ por@@ ting gir@@ ls ."
"We only had money for women to tra@@ in them , to s@@ end them to school , and nothing else ."
"B@@ y the time I came to the off@@ ice , of course my tra@@ in@@ ers were g@@ one ."
They r@@ an away home . N@@ o@@ body st@@ ay@@ ed there .
"M@@ y bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard was the only one there , and my vo@@ ice was completely g@@ one ."
"I was s@@ ha@@ ken up , and I s@@ at on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to sol@@ ve this problem ?"
Because we had tra@@ ining going on up n@@ or@@ th already .
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of women were there coming to get tra@@ ining .
"So I was sit@@ ting there , all of a su@@ dd@@ en , at this moment , talking about mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful d@@ on@@ ors called me about a re@@ port ."
"And she asked me , &quot; &quot; S@@ a@@ k@@ en@@ a ? &quot; &quot; And I ans@@ wer@@ ed her ."
"@@ No matter what I tri@@ ed to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again ."
"&quot; OK , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;"
I told her the whole story .
"A@@ t that time , she said , &quot; &quot; OK , you go next time , and you will help them ."
"You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same rou@@ te , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back f@@ ur@@ ther , the same young men , st@@ anding up there and hol@@ ding the ri@@ f@@ le and poin@@ ting to us to stop the car ."
"I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; OK , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ n one con@@ di@@ tion , that what@@ ever I say , you ac@@ cept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , y@@ es , they do ."
"So I took them to the m@@ os@@ qu@@ e , and to make a long story sh@@ ort , I told them I &apos;d give them te@@ ach@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are the best tra@@ in@@ ers ."
"They learn En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , they learn how to be te@@ ach@@ ers , they learn compu@@ ters , and they are my gu@@ id@@ es ."
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That t@@ ells you that education trans@@ for@@ ms people .
"So we are contin@@ u@@ ously gi@@ ving tra@@ ining to men , and I really believe str@@ on@@ g@@ ly ."
I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
I just want to share this with you .
"It was a beautiful country , beautiful , pe@@ ace@@ ful country ."
We were going every@@ where .
"W@@ om@@ en were getting education : la@@ w@@ y@@ er , engine@@ er , te@@ ac@@ her , and we were going from house to house ."
We never loc@@ ked our do@@ ors .
But we want the same A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an we had before .
And I want to tell you the other side .
"T@@ o@@ day , the women of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an are working very , very hard ."
They are ear@@ ning de@@ gre@@ es . They are tra@@ ining to be la@@ w@@ y@@ ers .
"They are tra@@ ining to be doc@@ tors , back again ."
"They are tra@@ ining to be te@@ ach@@ ers , and they are run@@ ning bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es ."
"So it is so wonderful to see people like that re@@ ach their comple@@ te pot@@ ential , and all of this is going to happen ."
"I want to share this with you , because of love , because of comp@@ as@@ sion , and because of tr@@ ust and h@@ on@@ est@@ y ."
"If you have these few things with you , you will ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh ."
"We have one po@@ et , M@@ aw@@ l@@ ā@@ n@@ ā R@@ ū@@ m@@ ī ."

"This is where I live . I live in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , at the s@@ outh par@@ ts of the N@@ a@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i N@@ a@@ tional P@@ ar@@ k ."
"Th@@ ose are my d@@ ad &apos;s co@@ ws at the back , and behind the co@@ ws , that &apos;s the N@@ a@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i N@@ a@@ tional P@@ ar@@ k ."
"N@@ a@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i N@@ a@@ tional P@@ ar@@ k is not f@@ enc@@ ed in the s@@ outh wi@@ de@@ ly , which means w@@ il@@ d animals like z@@ e@@ br@@ as m@@ ig@@ r@@ ate out of the par@@ k fre@@ ely ."
"So pre@@ dat@@ ors like li@@ ons fol@@ low them , and this is what they do ."
They k@@ ill our li@@ v@@ est@@ oc@@ k .
"This is one of the co@@ ws which was kill@@ ed at night , and I just w@@ o@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning and I found it de@@ ad , and I felt so bad , because it was the only b@@ ul@@ l we had ."
"M@@ y community , the M@@ a@@ as@@ a@@ i , we believe that we came from he@@ a@@ ven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we val@@ ue them so much ."
So I gre@@ w up h@@ ating li@@ ons so much .
"The mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who prot@@ ect our community and the li@@ v@@ est@@ oc@@ k , and they &apos;re also up@@ set about this problem ."
So they k@@ ill the li@@ ons .
It &apos;s one of the six li@@ ons which were kill@@ ed in N@@ a@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i .
And I think this is why the N@@ a@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i N@@ a@@ tional P@@ ar@@ k li@@ ons are few .
"So a bo@@ y , from six to n@@ ine years old , in my community is respon@@ sible for his d@@ ad &apos;s co@@ ws , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me ."
So I had to find a way of sol@@ ving this problem .
"And the first idea I got was to use fir@@ e , because I thought li@@ ons were sc@@ ar@@ ed of fir@@ e ."
"But I came to real@@ ize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even hel@@ ping the li@@ ons to see through the co@@ w@@ shed ."
So I didn &apos;t give up . I contin@@ u@@ ed .
And a second idea I got was to use a sc@@ ar@@ ec@@ row .
I was trying to tr@@ ick the li@@ ons &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was st@@ anding ne@@ ar the co@@ w@@ shed .
"But li@@ ons are very cle@@ ver . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the sc@@ ar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he j@@ um@@ ps in and kill@@ s the animals ."
"So one night , I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ shed with a t@@ or@@ ch , and that day , the li@@ ons didn &apos;t come ."
And I disco@@ vered that li@@ ons are af@@ ra@@ id of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
"S@@ ince I was a small bo@@ y , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took ap@@ art my mo@@ m &apos;s new ra@@ di@@ o , and that day she almost kill@@ ed me , but I learned a lot about electr@@ on@@ ics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car b@@ at@@ ter@@ y , an in@@ dic@@ ator bo@@ x . It &apos;s a small dev@@ ice found in a m@@ ot@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ cle , and it hel@@ ps m@@ ot@@ ori@@ sts when they want to turn right or left . It bl@@ in@@ ks ."
"And I got a s@@ w@@ it@@ ch where I can s@@ w@@ it@@ ch on the li@@ ghts , on and off ."
And that &apos;s a small t@@ or@@ ch from a bro@@ ken fl@@ ash@@ light .
So I set up everything .
"As you can see , the sol@@ ar p@@ an@@ el char@@ g@@ es the b@@ at@@ ter@@ y , and the b@@ at@@ ter@@ y sup@@ p@@ li@@ es the power to the small in@@ dic@@ ator bo@@ x . I call it a trans@@ form@@ er ."
And the in@@ dic@@ ator bo@@ x makes the li@@ ghts fl@@ as@@ h .
"As you can see , the b@@ ul@@ b@@ s face outside , because that &apos;s where the li@@ ons come from ."
And that &apos;s how it looks to li@@ ons when they come at night .
"The li@@ ghts fl@@ as@@ h and tr@@ ick the li@@ ons into thinking I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing in my bed ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks .
"So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experi@@ enc@@ ed any problem with li@@ ons ."
And my ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing h@@ omes heard about this idea .
One of them was this gr@@ and@@ mother .
"S@@ he had a lot of her animals being kill@@ ed by li@@ ons , and she asked me if I could put the li@@ ghts for her ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; So I put the li@@ ghts . You can see at the back , those are the li@@ on li@@ ghts ."
"S@@ ince now , I &apos;ve set up se@@ ven h@@ omes around my community , and they &apos;re really working ."
"And my idea is also being used now all over K@@ en@@ y@@ a for sc@@ ar@@ ing other pre@@ dat@@ ors like hy@@ en@@ as , le@@ op@@ ar@@ ds , and it &apos;s also being used to sc@@ are ele@@ ph@@ ants away from people &apos;s far@@ ms ."
"Because of this inv@@ en@@ tion , I was l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to get a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best s@@ cho@@ ols in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ house Inter@@ national S@@ ch@@ ool , and I &apos;m really exc@@ ited about this ."
My new school now is coming in and hel@@ ping by fund@@ ra@@ is@@ ing and cre@@ ating an a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
"I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing the li@@ ghts to the h@@ omes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m te@@ ach@@ ing them how to put them ."
"So one year ago , I was just a bo@@ y in the sa@@ v@@ an@@ n@@ a gr@@ ass@@ land her@@ ding my father &apos;s co@@ ws , and I used to see plan@@ es fl@@ ying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside ."
And here I am today .
I got a chan@@ ce to come by plan@@ e for my first time for TED .
So my big dre@@ am is to become an air@@ cra@@ ft engine@@ er and pi@@ lot when I gro@@ w up .

A@@ ni@@ mation and art has always been my first love .

"( Mus@@ ic ) Thank you . ( Applause ) A@@ ll of my an@@ ima@@ tions start with ideas , but what are ideas ?"
I@@ de@@ as can sp@@ ar@@ k a movement .
I@@ de@@ as are opport@@ uni@@ ties and innov@@ ation .
I@@ de@@ as tru@@ ly are what make the world go rou@@ nd .
"If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we w@@ ouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , me@@ dic@@ ine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives ."
"A@@ t e@@ ight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called M@@ ay@@ a &apos;s I@@ de@@ as , and my non@@ prof@@ it , M@@ ay@@ a &apos;s I@@ de@@ as for the P@@ lan@@ et ."
( Laughter ) And I make ec@@ o@@ -@@ fri@@ end@@ ly c@@ lo@@ thing and acc@@ ess@@ or@@ ies .
"I &apos;m 1@@ 3 now , and al@@ though I started my business in 200@@ 8 , my arti@@ sti@@ c jour@@ ney started way before then ."
"I was gre@@ at@@ ly in@@ flu@@ enc@@ ed by art , and I wanted to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate it in everything I did , even my business ."
"I would find different f@@ ab@@ r@@ ics around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a sc@@ ar@@ f or a h@@ at , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for desig@@ ns ."
"I no@@ tic@@ ed when I wor@@ e my cre@@ ations , people would stop me and say , &quot; W@@ ow , that &apos;s really c@@ ut@@ e . Wh@@ ere can I get one ? &quot;"
"And I thought , I can start my own business ."
Now I didn &apos;t have any business pl@@ ans at only e@@ ight years old .
I only knew I wanted to make pretty cre@@ ations that were sa@@ fe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
"M@@ y mo@@ m ta@@ u@@ ght me how to se@@ w , and on my back por@@ ch , I would s@@ it and make little he@@ ad@@ b@@ ands out of ri@@ b@@ b@@ on , and I would wr@@ ite down the nam@@ es and the pr@@ ice of each it@@ e@@ m ."
"I started making more it@@ ems like h@@ ats , sc@@ ar@@ ves and b@@ ag@@ s ."
"S@@ o@@ on , my it@@ ems beg@@ an sel@@ ling all over the world , and I had cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers in D@@ en@@ mar@@ k , I@@ tal@@ y , Au@@ str@@ al@@ ia , C@@ an@@ ad@@ a and more ."
"Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like br@@ anding and mar@@ ke@@ ting , st@@ ay@@ ing eng@@ ag@@ ed with my cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers , and seeing what so@@ ld the most and the least ."
"S@@ o@@ on , my business really started to take off ."
"Th@@ en one day , F@@ or@@ b@@ es mag@@ a@@ z@@ ine cont@@ ac@@ ted me when I was 10 years old ."
( Laughter ) They wanted to fe@@ ature me and my company in their ar@@ tic@@ le .
"Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business ec@@ o@@ -@@ fri@@ end@@ ly ?"
I &apos;ve had a p@@ as@@ sion for prot@@ ec@@ ting the environment and its cre@@ at@@ u@@ res since I was little .
My parents ta@@ u@@ ght me at an early age about gi@@ ving back and being a good ste@@ ward to the environment .
"I heard about how the d@@ y@@ es in some c@@ lo@@ thing or the process of even making the it@@ ems was har@@ m@@ ful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I disco@@ vered that even after d@@ ye@@ ing has being comple@@ ted , there is a wa@@ st@@ e issu@@ e that gi@@ ves a ne@@ g@@ ative imp@@ act on the environment ."
"For example , the gr@@ in@@ ding of materi@@ als , or the d@@ um@@ ping of dri@@ ed po@@ w@@ der materi@@ als ."
"Th@@ ese ac@@ tions can pol@@ l@@ ut@@ e the air , making it to@@ x@@ ic to any@@ one or anything that in@@ hal@@ es it ."
"So when I started my business , I knew two things : A@@ ll of my it@@ ems had to be ec@@ o@@ -@@ fri@@ end@@ ly , and 10 to 20 percent of the prof@@ its I made went to local and global ch@@ ari@@ ties and environ@@ m@@ ental organ@@ iz@@ ations ."
"( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new w@@ ave of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s that not only see@@ ks to have a suc@@ cess@@ ful business , but also a su@@ st@@ ain@@ able future ."
I feel that I can me@@ et the needs of my cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers without comp@@ r@@ om@@ is@@ ing the ability of future gener@@ ations to live in a gre@@ en@@ er tom@@ or@@ row .
"We live in a big , di@@ verse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more p@@ as@@ sion@@ ate to sa@@ ve it ."
But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your he@@ ads about the things that are happening in our world .
"It takes to get it through your hear@@ ts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when mov@@ em@@ ents are sp@@ ar@@ ked ."
"That is when opport@@ uni@@ ties and innov@@ ation are created , and that is why ideas come to life ."
"Th@@ ank you , and pe@@ ace and bl@@ ess@@ ings ."
"( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) P@@ at M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell : So , you heard M@@ ay@@ a talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredi@@ ble woman . Wh@@ ere are they ?"
"P@@ le@@ ase , M@@ r@@ . and M@@ r@@ s@@ . P@@ en@@ n . W@@ ould you just — A@@ h !"
( Applause )
"You know , one of the in@@ ten@@ se ple@@ as@@ u@@ res of tra@@ v@@ el and one of the deli@@ ghts of e@@ th@@ no@@ grap@@ hi@@ c research is the opport@@ un@@ ity to live am@@ on@@ g@@ st those who have not for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten the old ways , who still feel their past in the w@@ ind , tou@@ ch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by ra@@ in , ta@@ st@@ e it in the b@@ it@@ ter le@@ a@@ ves of plan@@ ts ."
"@@ J@@ ust to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar s@@ ha@@ m@@ ans still jour@@ ney be@@ y@@ on@@ d the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ d@@ ers still res@@ on@@ ate with me@@ an@@ ing , or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ a , the B@@ u@@ dd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ m@@ a , is to really remember the cen@@ tr@@ al re@@ v@@ el@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logy , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ e sense , but is just one model of reality , the con@@ sequ@@ ence of one particular set of ad@@ ap@@ tive cho@@ ices that our l@@ ine@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it suc@@ cess@@ fully , many gener@@ ations ago ."
"And of course , we all share the same ad@@ ap@@ tive im@@ per@@ a@@ ti@@ ves ."
We &apos;re all bor@@ n . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through in@@ i@@ ti@@ ation r@@ it@@ es .
"We have to de@@ al with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of de@@ ath , so it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t surpri@@ se us that we all sing , we all d@@ ance , we all have art ."
"But what &apos;s interesting is the uni@@ qu@@ e c@@ ad@@ ence of the s@@ ong , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every culture ."
"And whether it is the P@@ en@@ an in the fore@@ sts of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut des@@ er@@ t of N@@ or@@ ther@@ n K@@ en@@ y@@ a , the C@@ ur@@ and@@ er@@ o in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ des , or a car@@ av@@ ans@@ er@@ a@@ i in the middle of the S@@ a@@ har@@ a — this is in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally the fel@@ low that I tra@@ v@@ el@@ ed into the des@@ er@@ t with a mon@@ th ago — or in@@ de@@ ed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ m@@ a , E@@ ver@@ est , the go@@ dd@@ ess mother of the world ."
"A@@ ll of these pe@@ op@@ les te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ en@@ ting y@@ our@@ self in the Earth ."
"And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only f@@ ill you with hope ."
"Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a we@@ b of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual life and cul@@ tur@@ al life that en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ s the planet , and is as important to the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the planet as in@@ de@@ ed is the bio@@ logical we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ osp@@ here ."
"And you might think of this cul@@ tur@@ al we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here , and you might de@@ f@@ ine the e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here as being the su@@ m t@@ ot@@ al of all thou@@ ghts and dre@@ am@@ s , my@@ ths , ideas , in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tions , in@@ tu@@ i@@ tions b@@ rou@@ ght into being by the human imag@@ in@@ ation since the d@@ a@@ wn of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
The e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here is hum@@ an@@ ity &apos;s great le@@ g@@ acy .
It &apos;s the sym@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qui@@ si@@ tive species .
"And just as the bi@@ osp@@ here has been se@@ ver@@ ely er@@ o@@ ded , so too is the e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here — and , if anything , at a far gre@@ ater r@@ ate ."
"@@ No bio@@ logi@@ sts , for example , would d@@ are su@@ gg@@ est that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion because it sim@@ ply is not true , and yet that — the most ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of bio@@ logical di@@ versity — sc@@ ar@@ ce@@ ly appro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ versity ."
"And the great in@@ dic@@ ator of that , of course , is language l@@ oss ."
"When each of you in this room were bor@@ n , there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages sp@@ o@@ ken on the planet ."
"Now , a language is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical r@@ ules ."
A language is a fl@@ as@@ h of the human sp@@ ir@@ it .
It &apos;s a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the materi@@ al world .
"E@@ very language is an ol@@ d@@ -@@ growth fore@@ st of the mind , a wat@@ er@@ shed , a thought , an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties ."
"And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages , as we s@@ it here today in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of children ."
"They &apos;re no longer being ta@@ u@@ ght to bab@@ ies , which means , effec@@ tively , un@@ less something chang@@ es , they &apos;re already de@@ ad ."
"What could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to spe@@ ak your language , to have no way to p@@ ass on the w@@ is@@ dom of the an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors or an@@ tici@@ p@@ ate the pr@@ om@@ ise of the children ?"
"And yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the p@@ light of somebody some@@ where on Earth rou@@ gh@@ ly every two wee@@ ks , because every two wee@@ ks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ri@@ es with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ l@@ l@@ ab@@ les of an anci@@ ent t@@ on@@ gu@@ e ."
"And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , w@@ ouldn &apos;t it be better , w@@ ouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just sp@@ o@@ ke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at , let &apos;s make that language Yor@@ u@@ b@@ a . Let &apos;s make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ ese ."
Let &apos;s make it K@@ o@@ g@@ i . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly disco@@ ver what it would be like to be un@@ able to spe@@ ak your own language .
"And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here , a bri@@ e@@ f jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ n@@ osp@@ here , to try to beg@@ in to give you a sense of what in fact is being l@@ ost ."
"Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being ."
"T@@ ake , for example , this child of a B@@ ar@@ as@@ an@@ a in the N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ d@@ a who believe that my@@ th@@ o@@ log@@ ically they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the e@@ ast in the b@@ el@@ ly of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ na@@ kes ."
"Now , this is a people who co@@ g@@ ni@@ tively do not dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish the col@@ or bl@@ ue from the col@@ or gre@@ en because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the fore@@ st up@@ on which the people dep@@ end ."
They have a cur@@ i@@ ous language and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called &quot; &quot; l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic ex@@ o@@ ga@@ my : &quot; &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spe@@ a@@ ks a different language .
"And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ o@@ logical past , yet the cur@@ i@@ ous thing is in these long h@@ ous@@ es , where there are six or se@@ ven langu@@ ages sp@@ o@@ ken because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never hear any@@ one pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing a language ."
They sim@@ ply list@@ en and then beg@@ in to spe@@ ak .
"O@@ r , one of the most f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating tri@@ b@@ es I ever li@@ ved with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of n@@ or@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ace@@ fully in 19@@ 5@@ 8 ."
"In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies att@@ emp@@ ted cont@@ act and made a cri@@ tical m@@ ist@@ ake ."
"They d@@ rop@@ ped from the air 8 x 10 gl@@ os@@ s@@ y photograp@@ h@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be fri@@ end@@ ly ge@@ stu@@ res , for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st had never seen anything tw@@ o@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al in their lives ."
"They pic@@ ked up these photograp@@ h@@ s from the fore@@ st flo@@ or , tri@@ ed to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and con@@ clu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the de@@ vi@@ l , so they spe@@ ar@@ ed the five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies to de@@ ath ."
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ d@@ ers .
They spe@@ ar@@ ed each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them spe@@ ar@@ ing each other .
"We trac@@ ed gen@@ e@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back e@@ ight gener@@ ations , and we found two inst@@ anc@@ es of natural de@@ ath and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had g@@ ot@@ ten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ar@@ ed him any@@ way . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ i@@ ous know@@ le@@ dge of the fore@@ st that was ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing ."
Th@@ e@@ ir h@@ un@@ ters could sm@@ ell anim@@ al ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
"In the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , I had a really ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment when I was asked by my prof@@ ess@@ or at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard if I was interest@@ ed in going down to H@@ a@@ it@@ i , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the sec@@ re@@ t soci@@ e@@ ties which were the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of D@@ u@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ on@@ ton M@@ ac@@ out@@ es , and sec@@ uring the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es ."
"In order to make sense out of sen@@ sa@@ tion , of course , I had to understand something about this re@@ mar@@ k@@ able fa@@ ith of V@@ o@@ d@@ ou@@ n . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a black ma@@ gi@@ c cul@@ t ."
"O@@ n the con@@ tr@@ ary , it &apos;s a comple@@ x me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ys@@ ical wor@@ l@@ d@@ view ."
It &apos;s interesting .
"If I asked you to name the great reli@@ gi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?"
"@@ Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , I@@ s@@ la@@ m , B@@ u@@ dd@@ h@@ ism , J@@ u@@ d@@ a@@ ism , what@@ ever ."
"There &apos;s always one contin@@ ent left out , the ass@@ um@@ p@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa had no reli@@ gi@@ ous beli@@ e@@ f@@ s . Well , of course , they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is sim@@ ply the di@@ sti@@ l@@ l@@ ation of these very pro@@ found reli@@ gi@@ ous ideas that came over during the tra@@ gi@@ c D@@ i@@ as@@ por@@ a of the s@@ la@@ very er@@ a ."
"But , what makes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relation@@ ship between the living and the de@@ ad ."
"So , the living give b@@ ir@@ th to the sp@@ ir@@ its ."
"The sp@@ ir@@ its can be inv@@ o@@ ked from b@@ ene@@ ath the Gre@@ at W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to mom@@ ent@@ ar@@ ily dis@@ place the s@@ ou@@ l of the living , so that for that bri@@ e@@ f sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te bec@@ omes the go@@ d ."
That &apos;s why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ i@@ sts like to say that &quot; &quot; You wh@@ ite people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and spe@@ ak about G@@ od .
"We d@@ ance in the tem@@ ple and become G@@ od . &quot; &quot; And because you are pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed , you are taken by the sp@@ ir@@ it — how can you be har@@ m@@ ed ?"
"So you see these ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tions : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es in a state of tr@@ ance h@@ and@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ bers with imp@@ un@@ ity , a rather ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of the ability of the mind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ar@@ s it when c@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed in the state of extre@@ me exc@@ it@@ ation ."
"Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary are the K@@ o@@ g@@ i of the S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a de S@@ ant@@ a Mar@@ t@@ a in n@@ or@@ ther@@ n C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a ."
"D@@ es@@ c@@ end@@ ants of the anci@@ ent T@@ air@@ on@@ a civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation which once car@@ pe@@ ted the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain of C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a , in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic m@@ as@@ si@@ f that so@@ ar@@ s ab@@ o@@ ve the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain ."
"In a bloo@@ d@@ st@@ ain@@ ed contin@@ ent , these people al@@ one were never con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed by the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish ."
"T@@ o this day , they re@@ ma@@ in r@@ ul@@ ed by a r@@ it@@ ual pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood but the tra@@ ining for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood is rather ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ."
"The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es are taken away from their famili@@ es at the age of three and four , sequ@@ est@@ er@@ ed in a s@@ ha@@ do@@ w@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one hu@@ ts at the b@@ ase of gl@@ ac@@ i@@ ers for 1@@ 8 years : two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year per@@ i@@ o@@ ds deli@@ ber@@ ately ch@@ os@@ en to m@@ im@@ ic the n@@ ine months of ge@@ st@@ ation they sp@@ end in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are me@@ t@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother ."
"And for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ ues of their society , val@@ ues that ma@@ in@@ tain the pro@@ posi@@ tion that their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers and their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers al@@ one ma@@ in@@ tain the cos@@ m@@ ic — or we might say the ec@@ o@@ logical — b@@ al@@ ance ."
"And at the end of this amazing in@@ i@@ ti@@ ation , one day they &apos;re su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 1@@ 8 , they see a s@@ un@@ ri@@ se . And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first light as the S@@ u@@ n beg@@ ins to b@@ a@@ the the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly beautiful l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly everything they have learned in the ab@@ str@@ act is aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ ory . And the pri@@ est ste@@ ps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you ."
"It is that beautiful . It is y@@ ours to prot@@ ect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; el@@ der bro@@ thers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the youn@@ ger bro@@ thers , are the ones respon@@ sible for de@@ st@@ ro@@ ying the world ."
"Now , this level of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion bec@@ omes very important ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people and l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape , we ei@@ ther inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; &quot; no@@ ble sa@@ v@@ age , &quot; &quot; which is an idea r@@ ac@@ ist in its sim@@ p@@ lic@@ ity , or al@@ ter@@ na@@ tively , we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ o@@ re@@ a@@ u and say these people are clos@@ er to the Earth than we are ."
"Well , in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther s@@ enti@@ m@@ ental n@@ or we@@ a@@ k@@ en@@ ed by n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a ."
"There &apos;s not a lot of room for ei@@ ther in the m@@ al@@ ari@@ al s@@ w@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing win@@ ds of T@@ i@@ be@@ t , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , through time and r@@ it@@ ual , for@@ g@@ ed a tra@@ di@@ tional my@@ sti@@ qu@@ e of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ con@@ sci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ l@@ er in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion : the idea that the Earth itself can only ex@@ ist because it is brea@@ th@@ ed into being by human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
"Now , what does that mean ?"
It means that a young k@@ id from the An@@ des who &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that m@@ oun@@ tain is an Ap@@ u sp@@ ir@@ it that will direc@@ t his or her de@@ st@@ in@@ y will be a prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly different human being and have a different relation@@ ship to that res@@ our@@ ce or that place than a young k@@ id from M@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ a ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a m@@ oun@@ tain is a pi@@ le of ro@@ c@@ k ready to be min@@ ed .
Wh@@ e@@ ther it &apos;s the ab@@ o@@ de of a sp@@ ir@@ it or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ re@@ lev@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or that de@@ fin@@ es the relation@@ ship between the individu@@ al and the natural world .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the fore@@ sts of B@@ ri@@ tis@@ h C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those fore@@ sts ex@@ ist@@ ed to be c@@ ut .
"That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ g@@ st the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those fore@@ sts were the ab@@ o@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked B@@ e@@ ak of H@@ ea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al sp@@ ir@@ its that d@@ w@@ ell@@ ed at the n@@ or@@ th end of the world , sp@@ ir@@ its they would have to eng@@ age during their H@@ am@@ at@@ s@@ a in@@ i@@ ti@@ ation ."
"Now , if you beg@@ in to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different real@@ i@@ ties , you could beg@@ in to understand some of their ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary disco@@ ver@@ ies . T@@ ake this plant here ."
It &apos;s a photograp@@ h I took in the N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last Ap@@ ri@@ l .
"This is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ac@@ tive pre@@ par@@ ation of the s@@ ha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ ire ."
"What makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ o@@ logical pot@@ ential of this pre@@ par@@ ation , but the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of it .

"This plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine ."

So I started plan@@ ning how to help them es@@ cap@@ e .
I was so surpri@@ sed that a t@@ ot@@ al str@@ an@@ ger car@@ ed enough to ask .
I real@@ ized that this was a sym@@ bo@@ li@@ c moment in my life .
( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause )
This is a kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten we desig@@ ned in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten to be a cir@@ cle .
It &apos;s a kind of end@@ less cir@@ cul@@ ation on top of the ro@@ of .
"If you are a par@@ ent , you know that kids love to keep making cir@@ cl@@ es ."
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we design this ?
"The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al of this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ si@@ st@@ ed : &quot; &quot; How about having a net s@@ tic@@ king out from the ed@@ ge of the ro@@ of ?"
"So that it can c@@ at@@ ch the children f@@ all@@ ing off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government off@@ ici@@ al said , &quot; O@@ f course you have to have a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il . &quot;"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es pop@@ ping through .
And we were allo@@ wed to call this rop@@ e as a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il .
"But of course , rop@@ e has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times 40 children are around a t@@ ree .
"The bo@@ y on the br@@ an@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the t@@ ree so he is e@@ ating the t@@ ree ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they s@@ it on the ed@@ ge ."
It looks so n@@ ice from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys in the z@@ o@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ e@@ ding time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g was@@ h@@ ing place — there are many kinds of water t@@ aps .
"You see with the f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble tu@@ b@@ es , you want to sp@@ r@@ ay water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in front is quite norm@@ al ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not was@@ h@@ ing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s p@@ ut@@ ting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
So there is no ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ c bar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qui@@ et bo@@ x , some of them get really ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ v@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary .
"And the prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to st@@ ay in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back ev@@ en@@ tually , because it &apos;s a cir@@ cle , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of oc@@ c@@ as@@ ion , us@@ u@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ d@@ ly , we consi@@ der no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qui@@ et space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten , these children show amazing con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion in cl@@ ass ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the j@@ un@@ gle with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not sup@@ posed to be in sil@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control ."
"You know , it &apos;s completely open ."
And you should know that we can go s@@ ki@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in win@@ ter .
In sum@@ m@@ er you go s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
"And also , you should know that you are wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of ."
You never m@@ el@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are sup@@ posed to be outside ."
So that is how we should tre@@ at them .
This is how they divi@@ de cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
They are sup@@ posed to help te@@ ach@@ ers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A cl@@ ass@@ room .
And a was@@ h@@ bas@@ in .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the cl@@ ass@@ room .
A mon@@ key trying to fish another mon@@ key from ab@@ o@@ ve .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each cl@@ ass@@ room has at least one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ ant@@ a C@@ l@@ au@@ s comes down at the time of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ sh@@ ap@@ ed kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten ."
The building is only five me@@ ters t@@ all with se@@ ven flo@@ ors .
"And of course , the ce@@ il@@ ing he@@ ight is very low ."
So you have to consi@@ der sa@@ fe@@ ty .
"So , we put our children , a d@@ aughter and a son ."
They tri@@ ed to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s o@@ kay . H@@ is sk@@ ul@@ l is quite str@@ ong .
He is resi@@ li@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to j@@ um@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ ff@@ ic j@@ am is aw@@ ful in T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in front , she needs to learn how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now these days , kids need a small d@@ os@@ age of d@@ an@@ ger ."
"And in this kind of oc@@ c@@ as@@ ion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of opport@@ un@@ ity we are l@@ os@@ ing these days .
"Now , this dra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the movement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
And the cir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence of this building is 1@@ 8@@ 3 me@@ ters .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 me@@ ters in the mor@@ ning ."
But the surpri@@ se is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 me@@ ters on a@@ ver@@ age ."
And these children have the high@@ est a@@ th@@ le@@ tic ab@@ ili@@ ties am@@ ong many kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ s .
"The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
J@@ ust like sh@@ e@@ ep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep run@@ ning . ( Laughter )
"M@@ y point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t prot@@ ect them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble sometimes ."
They need to get some in@@ j@@ ury .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
"I think arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture is cap@@ able of chang@@ ing this world , and people &apos;s lives ."
And this is one of the att@@ emp@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .

Here are some imag@@ es of clu@@ st@@ ers of g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
"They are these huge coll@@ ec@@ tions of g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies , b@@ ound together by their m@@ u@@ tual gra@@ v@@ ity ."
"So most of the poin@@ ts that you see on the scre@@ en are not individu@@ al star@@ s , but coll@@ ec@@ tions of star@@ s , or g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies ."
"Now , by sho@@ wing you some of these imag@@ es , I hope that you will quickly see that g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are these beautiful ob@@ jects , but more than that , I think g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous , they are surpri@@ sing , and they &apos;re us@@ e@@ ful ."
U@@ se@@ ful as the universe &apos;s most m@@ as@@ sive l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ ies .
"And as l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ ies , to des@@ cri@@ be g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers is to des@@ cri@@ be the experim@@ ents that you can do with them ."
"And I think there are four maj@@ or typ@@ es , and the first typ@@ e that I want to des@@ cri@@ be is prob@@ ing the very big ."
"So , how big ?"
"Well , here is an image of a particular g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster ."
"It is so m@@ as@@ sive that the light p@@ ass@@ ing through it is being b@@ ent , it &apos;s being di@@ stor@@ ted by the extre@@ me gra@@ v@@ ity of this clu@@ ster ."
"And , in fact , if you look very care@@ fully you &apos;ll be able to see r@@ ings around this clu@@ ster ."
"Now , to give you a number , this particular g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster has a m@@ ass of over one million billion s@@ un@@ s ."
It &apos;s just min@@ d@@ -@@ bo@@ gg@@ ling how m@@ as@@ sive these systems can get .
"But more than their m@@ ass , they have this ad@@ di@@ tional fe@@ ature ."
"They are ess@@ enti@@ ally is@@ ol@@ ated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sion of the entire universe ."
"And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large sc@@ al@@ es , such as , how does gra@@ v@@ ity work ?"
might be ans@@ wer@@ ed by stud@@ ying these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very h@@ ot .
"O@@ kay , if I take an image of a g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ ster , and I sub@@ tr@@ act away all of the star@@ light , what I &apos;m left with is this big , bl@@ ue b@@ lo@@ b ."
This is in f@@ al@@ se col@@ or .
It &apos;s actually X@@ -@@ r@@ ay light that we &apos;re seeing .
"And the question is , if it &apos;s not g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies , what is em@@ it@@ ting this light ?"
"The answer is h@@ ot g@@ as , m@@ illi@@ on@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e g@@ as — in fact , it &apos;s pl@@ as@@ m@@ a ."
And the reason why it &apos;s so h@@ ot goes back to the pre@@ vi@@ ous sli@@ de .
"The extre@@ me gra@@ v@@ ity of these systems is acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating partic@@ les of g@@ as to great spe@@ e@@ ds , and great spe@@ e@@ ds means great tem@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res ."
"So this is the ma@@ in idea , but science is a rou@@ gh dra@@ ft ."
"There are many bas@@ ic pro@@ per@@ ties about this pl@@ as@@ m@@ a that still conf@@ use us , still pu@@ z@@ z@@ le us , and still p@@ us@@ h our underst@@ anding of the phys@@ ics of the very h@@ ot ."
Th@@ ird thing : prob@@ ing the very small .
"Now , to expl@@ ain this , I need to tell you a very dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing fact ."
M@@ ost of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of at@@ om@@ s .
You were li@@ ed to .
"M@@ ost of it is made up of something very , very my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous , which we call dar@@ k matter ."
"D@@ ar@@ k matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to inter@@ act very much , ex@@ cept through gra@@ v@@ ity , and of course we would like to learn more about it ."
"If you &apos;re a partic@@ le phys@@ ic@@ ist , you want to know what happens when we sm@@ as@@ h things together ."
And dar@@ k matter is no ex@@ cep@@ tion .
"Well , how do we do this ?"
"T@@ o answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers col@@ li@@ de ?"
Here is an image .
"S@@ ince g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tive s@@ lic@@ es of the universe , sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sions ."
"They are m@@ os@@ tly made up of dar@@ k matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this bl@@ u@@ ish pur@@ ple ."
"The red re@@ pres@@ ents the h@@ ot g@@ as , and , of course , you can see many g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies ."
"What &apos;s happened is a partic@@ le acc@@ el@@ er@@ ator at a huge , huge scale ."
"And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effec@@ ts that might be difficult to de@@ t@@ ect in the la@@ b , might be comp@@ oun@@ ded and comp@@ oun@@ ded into something that we could possi@@ bly ob@@ ser@@ ve in nature ."
"So , it &apos;s very fun@@ n@@ y ."
"The reason why g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers can te@@ ach us about dar@@ k matter , the reason why g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers can te@@ ach us about the phys@@ ics of the very small , is pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly because they are so very big ."
F@@ our@@ th thing : the phys@@ ics of the very str@@ an@@ ge .
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly what I &apos;ve said so far is cra@@ z@@ y .
"O@@ kay , if there &apos;s anything str@@ an@@ ger I think it has to be dar@@ k energy ."
"If I th@@ row a b@@ all into the air , I exp@@ ect it to go up ."
What I don &apos;t exp@@ ect is that it go up at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing r@@ ate .
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , cos@@ mo@@ logi@@ sts understand why the universe is exp@@ anding ."
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s exp@@ anding at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing r@@ ate .
"They give the c@@ ause of this acc@@ el@@ er@@ ated exp@@ an@@ sion a name , and they call it dar@@ k energy ."
"And , again , we want to learn more about it ."
"So , one particular question that we have is , how does dar@@ k energy aff@@ ect the universe at the lar@@ g@@ est sc@@ al@@ es ?"
"D@@ ep@@ en@@ ding on how str@@ ong it is , maybe structure for@@ ms fa@@ ster or s@@ lo@@ wer ."
"Well , the problem with the lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ bly comp@@ lic@@ ated ."
Here is a computer sim@@ ulation .
And we need a way to sim@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y it .
"Well , I like to think about this using an an@@ al@@ o@@ gy ."
"If I want to understand the s@@ in@@ king of the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little posi@@ tions of every single little piece of the bo@@ at that bro@@ ke off ."
The most important thing to do is to tr@@ ack the two bi@@ gg@@ est par@@ ts .
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the lar@@ g@@ est sc@@ al@@ es by trac@@ king its bi@@ gg@@ est piec@@ es and those bi@@ gg@@ est piec@@ es are clu@@ st@@ ers of g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies ."
"So , as I come to a close , you might feel sli@@ gh@@ tly che@@ ated ."
"I mean , I beg@@ an by talking about how g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are us@@ e@@ ful , and I &apos;ve given some reas@@ ons , but what is their use really ?"
"Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quot@@ e by H@@ en@@ ry F@@ ord when he was asked about car@@ s ."
"He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said fa@@ ster hor@@ ses . &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day , we as a society are fac@@ ed with many , many difficult problems ."
And the solu@@ tions to these problems are not obvi@@ ous .
They are not fa@@ ster hor@@ ses .
They will re@@ qu@@ ire an en@@ orm@@ ous amoun@@ t of scienti@@ fic in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity .
"So , y@@ es , we need to foc@@ us , y@@ es , we need to con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate , but we also need to remember that innov@@ ation , in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity , in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion — these things come when we bro@@ ad@@ en our fiel@@ d of vi@@ sion when we ste@@ p back when we z@@ oo@@ m out ."
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by stud@@ ying the universe around us . Th@@ an@@ ks .

"A@@ t the time , I was car@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , speci@@ al@@ iz@@ ing in car@@ di@@ a@@ c imag@@ ing tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es ."
The call came from a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an at the L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es Z@@ o@@ o .
A@@ n el@@ der@@ ly f@@ em@@ ale ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e had w@@ o@@ ken up with a fac@@ i@@ al dro@@ op and the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were wor@@ ri@@ ed that she &apos;d had a st@@ ro@@ ke .

"Now , to be cle@@ ar , N@@ or@@ th American z@@ oo@@ s are st@@ aff@@ ed by high@@ ly qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ed , bo@@ ar@@ d@@ -@@ cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans who take out@@ st@@ anding care of their anim@@ al patients ."
"But oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally , they do re@@ ach into the human me@@ d@@ ical community , partic@@ ul@@ arly for some speci@@ ality con@@ s@@ ul@@ tation , and I was one of the l@@ uc@@ k@@ y phys@@ ici@@ ans who was inv@@ ited in to help ."
"I had a chan@@ ce to ru@@ le out a st@@ ro@@ ke in this ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e and make sure that this g@@ or@@ ill@@ a didn &apos;t have a t@@ or@@ n a@@ or@@ t@@ a , ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate this m@@ ac@@ a@@ w for a heart m@@ ur@@ m@@ ur , make sure that this C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a se@@ a li@@ on &apos;s par@@ ic@@ ar@@ di@@ um wasn &apos;t in@@ fl@@ am@@ ed , and in this picture , I &apos;m list@@ ening to the heart of a li@@ on after a li@@ f@@ es@@ a@@ ving , coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure with ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans and phys@@ ici@@ ans where we dra@@ ined 7@@ 00 c@@ c &apos;s of flu@@ id from the sa@@ c in which this li@@ on &apos;s heart was con@@ ta@@ ined ."
"And this pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure , which I have done on many human patients , was id@@ en@@ tical , with the ex@@ cep@@ tion of that pa@@ w and that ta@@ il ."
"Now most of the time , I was working at U@@ C@@ L@@ A M@@ ed@@ ical C@@ en@@ ter with phys@@ ici@@ ans , di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s and di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ es and tre@@ at@@ ments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es Z@@ o@@ o with ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans , di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s and di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ es and tre@@ at@@ ments for their anim@@ al patients ."

And here &apos;s what started coming into very cle@@ ar foc@@ us for me .
"P@@ h@@ ys@@ ici@@ ans and ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were ess@@ enti@@ ally taking care of the same dis@@ ord@@ ers in their anim@@ al and human patients : con@@ g@@ es@@ tive heart fa@@ il@@ ure , brain tu@@ m@@ ors , le@@ u@@ k@@ em@@ ia , di@@ ab@@ et@@ es , ar@@ th@@ r@@ it@@ is , A@@ L@@ S , bre@@ ast cancer , even p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dr@@ omes like de@@ pres@@ sion , an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , comp@@ ul@@ sions , e@@ ating dis@@ ord@@ ers and self-@@ in@@ j@@ ury ."
"Now , I &apos;ve got a conf@@ es@@ sion to make ."
"E@@ ven though I stu@@ died com@@ par@@ ative ph@@ y@@ si@@ o@@ logy and evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary bio@@ logy as an under@@ gra@@ d — I had even writ@@ ten my sen@@ i@@ or the@@ s@@ is on D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ an the@@ ory — learning about the sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant over@@ la@@ p between the dis@@ ord@@ ers of animals and hum@@ ans , it came as a much needed wa@@ ke@@ -@@ up call for me ."
"So I started wonder@@ ing , with all of these over@@ l@@ aps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an , or con@@ s@@ ult the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary liter@@ ature , for in@@ si@@ ghts into one of my human patients ?"
"Wh@@ y had I never , n@@ or had any of my phys@@ ici@@ an friends and col@@ le@@ ag@@ ues wh@@ om I asked , ever at@@ ten@@ ded a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary conf@@ er@@ ence ?"
"For that matter , why was any of this a surpri@@ se ?"
"I mean , look , every single phys@@ ici@@ an ac@@ cep@@ ts some bio@@ logical connec@@ tion between animals and hum@@ ans ."
E@@ very me@@ dic@@ ation that we pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ be or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our famili@@ es has first been te@@ st@@ ed on an anim@@ al .
But there &apos;s something very different about gi@@ ving an anim@@ al a me@@ dic@@ ation or a human disease and the anim@@ al develop@@ ing con@@ g@@ es@@ tive heart fa@@ il@@ ure or di@@ ab@@ et@@ es or bre@@ ast cancer on their own .
"Now , maybe some of the surpri@@ se comes from the incre@@ as@@ ing se@@ par@@ ation in our world between the ur@@ b@@ an and the non@@ ur@@ b@@ an ."
"You know , we hear about these city kids who think that w@@ ool gro@@ ws on tre@@ es or that che@@ ese comes from a plant ."
"Well , today &apos;s human h@@ osp@@ it@@ als , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly , are tur@@ ning into these g@@ le@@ am@@ ing ca@@ the@@ dr@@ als of technology ."
And this cre@@ ates a p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical dist@@ ance between the human patients who are being tre@@ ated there and anim@@ al patients who are living in oce@@ ans and far@@ ms and j@@ un@@ g@@ les .
But I think there &apos;s an even de@@ ep@@ er reason .
"P@@ h@@ ys@@ ici@@ ans and scienti@@ sts , we ac@@ cept int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tually that our species , H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , is mer@@ ely one species , no more uni@@ qu@@ e or speci@@ al than any other ."
"But in our hear@@ ts , we don &apos;t completely believe that ."
I feel it myself when I &apos;m list@@ ening to M@@ o@@ z@@ art or looking at pic@@ tures of the Mar@@ s R@@ over on my M@@ ac@@ B@@ ook .
"I feel that tu@@ g of human ex@@ cep@@ tion@@ al@@ ism , even as I reco@@ gn@@ ize the scienti@@ f@@ ically is@@ ol@@ ating cost of seeing ourselves as a super@@ i@@ or species , ap@@ art ."
"Well , I &apos;m trying these days ."
"When I see a human pati@@ ent now , I always ask , what do the anim@@ al doc@@ tors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?"
"And , might I be taking better care of my human pati@@ ent if I saw them as a human anim@@ al pati@@ ent ?"
Here are a few exam@@ ples of the kind of exc@@ iting connec@@ tions that this kind of thinking has led me to .
F@@ ear@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed heart fa@@ il@@ ure .
"A@@ rou@@ nd the year 20@@ 00 , human car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ sts &quot; &quot; disco@@ vered &quot; &quot; emo@@ tion@@ ally in@@ duc@@ ed heart fa@@ il@@ ure ."
"It was des@@ cri@@ bed in a g@@ am@@ bl@@ ing father who had l@@ ost his life &apos;s sa@@ v@@ ings with a ro@@ ll of the d@@ ice , in a bri@@ de who &apos;d been left at the al@@ ter ."
"But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is was ne@@ i@@ ther new , n@@ or was it uni@@ qu@@ ely human ."
"@@ V@@ e@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans had been di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing , tre@@ ating and even pre@@ ven@@ ting emo@@ tion@@ ally in@@ duc@@ ed sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s in animals r@@ ang@@ ing from mon@@ ke@@ ys to fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , from to de@@ er to r@@ ab@@ b@@ its , since the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
How many human lives might have been sa@@ ved if this ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary know@@ le@@ dge had been put into the h@@ ands of E@@ .@@ R@@ . doc@@ s and car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ sts ?
S@@ el@@ f-@@ in@@ j@@ ury .
S@@ ome human patients har@@ m themselves .
"S@@ ome pl@@ uc@@ k out pat@@ ch@@ es of ha@@ ir , others actually c@@ ut themselves ."
S@@ ome anim@@ al patients also har@@ m themselves .
There are b@@ ir@@ ds that pl@@ uc@@ k out fe@@ a@@ thers .
There are st@@ al@@ li@@ ons that re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tively b@@ ite their fl@@ an@@ ks until they b@@ le@@ ed .
But ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have very speci@@ fic and very effec@@ tive ways of tre@@ ating and even pre@@ ven@@ ting self-@@ in@@ j@@ ury in their self-@@ in@@ j@@ uring animals .
S@@ h@@ ouldn &apos;t this ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary know@@ le@@ dge be put into the h@@ ands of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ther@@ ap@@ i@@ sts and parents and patients str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with self-@@ in@@ j@@ ury ?
P@@ os@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pres@@ sion and pos@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m p@@ sy@@ ch@@ os@@ is .
"S@@ ome@@ times , so@@ on after gi@@ ving b@@ ir@@ th , some women become de@@ pres@@ sed , and sometimes they become ser@@ i@@ ously de@@ pres@@ sed and even p@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic ."
"They may ne@@ gl@@ ect their ne@@ w@@ bor@@ n , and in some extre@@ me c@@ ases , even har@@ m the child ."
"E@@ qu@@ ine ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans also know that oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally , a m@@ are , so@@ on after gi@@ ving b@@ ir@@ th , will ne@@ gl@@ ect the fo@@ al , re@@ f@@ using to n@@ ur@@ se , and in some inst@@ anc@@ es , k@@ ick the fo@@ al , even to de@@ ath ."
But ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have de@@ vi@@ sed an inter@@ ven@@ tion to de@@ al with this fo@@ al re@@ jec@@ tion sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome that invol@@ ves incre@@ as@@ ing o@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in in the m@@ are .
"O@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in is the b@@ on@@ ding h@@ orm@@ one , and this le@@ ads to r@@ ene@@ wed inter@@ est , on the part of the m@@ are , in her fo@@ al ."
S@@ h@@ ouldn &apos;t this information be put into the h@@ ands of o@@ b / g@@ y@@ n &apos;s and family doc@@ tors and patients who are str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with pos@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pres@@ sion and p@@ sy@@ ch@@ os@@ is ?
"Well , des@@ p@@ ite all of this pr@@ om@@ ise , un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately the g@@ ul@@ f between our fiel@@ ds re@@ ma@@ ins large ."
"T@@ o expl@@ ain it , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;m going to have to air some di@@ r@@ ty la@@ und@@ ry ."
S@@ ome phys@@ ici@@ ans can be real s@@ no@@ b@@ s about doc@@ tors who are not M@@ .@@ D@@ . &apos; s .
"I &apos;m talking about d@@ enti@@ sts and op@@ t@@ ome@@ tri@@ sts and p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts , but maybe es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally anim@@ al doc@@ tors ."
"O@@ f course , most phys@@ ici@@ ans don &apos;t real@@ ize that it is har@@ der to get into v@@ et school these days than me@@ d@@ ical school , and that when we go to me@@ d@@ ical school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , but ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans need to learn about health and disease in ma@@ m@@ m@@ als , am@@ p@@ hi@@ bi@@ ans , re@@ p@@ ti@@ les , fish and b@@ ir@@ ds ."
So I don &apos;t b@@ la@@ me the ve@@ ts for fe@@ eling an@@ no@@ y@@ ed by my prof@@ es@@ sion &apos;s con@@ des@@ cen@@ sion and ig@@ n@@ or@@ ance .
But here &apos;s one from the ve@@ ts : What do you call a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an who can only take care of one species ?
"A phys@@ ici@@ an . ( Laughter ) C@@ l@@ os@@ ing the ga@@ p has become a p@@ as@@ sion for me , and I &apos;m doing this through progra@@ ms like D@@ ar@@ w@@ in on R@@ ounds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , where we &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing anim@@ al exper@@ ts and evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary bio@@ logi@@ sts and em@@ be@@ d@@ ding them on our me@@ d@@ ical te@@ am@@ s with our inter@@ ns and our resi@@ d@@ ents ."

"A@@ t Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity conf@@ er@@ ences , par@@ tici@@ p@@ ants learn how tre@@ ating bre@@ ast cancer in a ti@@ ger can help us better tre@@ at bre@@ ast cancer in a kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten te@@ ac@@ her ; how underst@@ anding pol@@ y@@ c@@ y@@ sti@@ c over@@ ies in a H@@ ol@@ ste@@ in c@@ ow can help us better take care of a d@@ ance in@@ struc@@ tor with pa@@ in@@ ful per@@ i@@ o@@ ds ; and how better underst@@ anding the tre@@ at@@ ment of se@@ par@@ ation an@@ x@@ i@@ ety in a high@@ -@@ str@@ un@@ g S@@ hel@@ ti@@ e can help an an@@ x@@ i@@ ous young child str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with his first days of school ."
"In the United States and now inter@@ na@@ tion@@ ally , at Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity conf@@ er@@ ences phys@@ ici@@ ans and ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans ch@@ ec@@ k their at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des and their pre@@ con@@ cep@@ tions at the do@@ or and come together as col@@ le@@ ag@@ ues , as pe@@ ers , as doc@@ tors ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , we hum@@ ans are animals , too , and it &apos;s time for us phys@@ ici@@ ans to em@@ br@@ ace our patients &apos; and our own anim@@ al nat@@ u@@ res and jo@@ in ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans in a speci@@ es@@ -@@ sp@@ an@@ ning appro@@ ach to health ."
"Because it turns out , some of the best and most hum@@ an@@ is@@ tic me@@ dic@@ ine is being pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed by doc@@ tors wh@@ ose patients ar@@ en &apos;t human ."
"And one of the best ways we can take care of the human pati@@ ent is by p@@ ay@@ ing close at@@ ten@@ tion to how all the other patients on the planet live , gro@@ w , get s@@ ick and he@@ al ."

You sp@@ end it at rest and you sp@@ end it at work .
"And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an air@@ plan@@ e a good por@@ tion of your time tra@@ v@@ eling some place ."
"So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody as@@ ks you , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere do you live , where do you work , and where do you sp@@ end all your time ?"
"And where do you exp@@ ose y@@ ourselves to ris@@ ks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion that I sp@@ end about 7@@ 5 percent of my time rela@@ tively in a small number of places ."
"And I don &apos;t wan@@ der far from that place for a maj@@ or@@ ity of my time , even though I &apos;m an ex@@ ten@@ sive global tre@@ k@@ ker ."
"Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little jour@@ ney here ."
"I started off in S@@ cr@@ an@@ ton , P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ an@@ ia ."
"I don &apos;t know if any@@ body might ha@@ il from n@@ or@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ an@@ ia , but this is where I sp@@ ent my first 1@@ 9 years with my little young l@@ un@@ gs ."
"You know , brea@@ thing high con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tions here of s@@ ul@@ fu@@ r di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de , car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de and me@@ th@@ an@@ e g@@ as , in un@@ equ@@ al qu@@ anti@@ ties — 1@@ 9 years of this ."
"And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those p@@ il@@ es of bur@@ ning , sm@@ ol@@ der@@ ing co@@ al wa@@ st@@ e look like ."
"So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid@@ -@@ w@@ est ."
"O@@ K , so I en@@ ded up in L@@ ou@@ is@@ v@@ il@@ le , K@@ ent@@ uc@@ k@@ y ."
"Well , I decided to be ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors to a place called R@@ u@@ b@@ ber@@ to@@ wn ."
They man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture pl@@ as@@ tics . They use large qu@@ anti@@ ties ch@@ l@@ or@@ op@@ r@@ en@@ e and b@@ en@@ z@@ en@@ e .
"O@@ kay , I sp@@ ent 25 years , in my mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ age l@@ un@@ gs now , brea@@ thing vari@@ ous con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tions of that ."
"And on a cle@@ ar day it always looked like this , so you never saw it ."
It was in@@ si@@ di@@ ous and it was really happening .
"Th@@ en I decided I had to get really s@@ mar@@ t , I would take this job in the W@@ est C@@ o@@ ast ."
And I mo@@ ved to R@@ ed@@ l@@ ands C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
"@@ V@@ ery n@@ ice , and there my ol@@ der , sen@@ i@@ or l@@ un@@ gs , as I like to call them , I f@@ ill@@ ed with partic@@ ul@@ ate matter , car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de and very high d@@ os@@ es of o@@ z@@ one ."
O@@ kay ? Al@@ most like the high@@ est in the n@@ ation .
"A@@ l@@ right , this is what it looks like on a good day ."
"If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about ."
"So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?"
"Well , the picture is , there is a huge ga@@ p here ."
The one thing that never happens in my doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice : They never ask me about my place history .
"@@ No doc@@ tor , can I remember , ever as@@ king me , &quot; Wh@@ ere have you li@@ ved ? &quot;"
They ha@@ ven &apos;t asked me what kind of the qu@@ ality of the dr@@ in@@ king water that I put in my m@@ outh or the food that I ing@@ est into my st@@ om@@ ach .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s mis@@ sing .
L@@ ook at the kind of data that &apos;s av@@ a@@ il@@ able .
This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries sp@@ end b@@ illions of dollars inv@@ est@@ ing in this kind of research .
"Now , I &apos;ve cir@@ cl@@ ed the places where I &apos;ve been ."
"Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart att@@ ack I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?"
"So , how many people are in the wh@@ ite ?"
How many people in the room have sp@@ ent the maj@@ or@@ ity of their life in the wh@@ ite space ?
An@@ y@@ body ? B@@ o@@ y you &apos;re l@@ uc@@ k@@ y .
How many have sp@@ ent it in the red places ?
"O@@ h , not so l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ."
There are thousands of these kinds of m@@ aps that are dis@@ play@@ ed in at@@ l@@ ases all over the world .
They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our tra@@ in w@@ rec@@ k .
But n@@ one of that &apos;s in my me@@ d@@ ical rec@@ ord .
And it &apos;s not in y@@ ours ei@@ ther .
"So , here &apos;s my friend P@@ au@@ l ."
"He &apos;s a col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue . He allo@@ wed his cell phone to be trac@@ ked every two hours , 2@@ 4 / 7 , 3@@ 6@@ 5 days out of the year for the last two years , every@@ where he went ."
And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
And this is where he has sp@@ ent most of his time .
If you really stu@@ died that you might have some clu@@ es as to what P@@ au@@ l li@@ kes to do .
An@@ y@@ body got any clu@@ es ? S@@ k@@ i . Right .
"We can z@@ oo@@ m in here , and we su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly see that now we see where P@@ au@@ l has really sp@@ ent a maj@@ or@@ ity of his time ."
And all of those black d@@ ots are all of the to@@ x@@ ic re@@ le@@ ase inv@@ ent@@ or@@ ies that are mon@@ it@@ o@@ red by the E@@ P@@ A .
D@@ id you know that data ex@@ ist@@ ed ?
"For every community in the United States , you could have your own person@@ al@@ ized ma@@ p of that ."
"So , our cell ph@@ ones can now build a place history ."
This is how P@@ au@@ l did it . He did it with his i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
This might be what we end up with .
This is what the phys@@ ici@@ an would have in front of him and her when we en@@ ter that ex@@ am room instead of just the p@@ ink sli@@ p that said I pa@@ id at the coun@@ ter . Right ?
This could be my little ass@@ ess@@ ment .
"And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a B@@ ill , I su@@ gg@@ est that maybe you not deci@@ de , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , and it &apos;s war@@ m every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k at night ."
"I &apos;d su@@ gg@@ est that that &apos;s a bad idea B@@ ill , because of this re@@ port . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tions ."
"O@@ kay , number one is , we must te@@ ach phys@@ ici@@ ans about the val@@ ue of ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ ical information ."
It &apos;s called ge@@ ome@@ dic@@ ine . There are about a half a do@@ z@@ en progra@@ ms in the world right now that are foc@@ used on this .
And they &apos;re in the early st@@ ages of develop@@ ment .
"Th@@ ese progra@@ ms need to be sup@@ por@@ ted , and we need to te@@ ach our future doc@@ tors of the world the import@@ ance of some of the information I &apos;ve shar@@ ed here with you today ."
"The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding b@@ illions and b@@ illions of dollars all over the world building an electr@@ on@@ ic health rec@@ ord , we make sure we put a place history inside that me@@ d@@ ical rec@@ ord ."
It not only will be important for the phys@@ ici@@ an ; it will be important for the resear@@ ch@@ ers that now will have huge sa@@ m@@ ples to dra@@ w up@@ on .
But it will also be us@@ e@@ ful for us .
"I could have made the deci@@ sion , if I had this information , not to move to the o@@ z@@ one cap@@ ital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that deci@@ sion ."
O@@ r I could ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate with my emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er to make that deci@@ sion in the best inter@@ est of myself and my company .
"W@@ ith that , I would like to just say that J@@ ack L@@ ord said this almost 10 years ago ."
J@@ ust look at that for a minut@@ e .
"That was what the con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion of the D@@ ar@@ t@@ m@@ outh A@@ t@@ l@@ as of H@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ care was about , was saying that we can expl@@ ain the ge@@ ograp@@ hi@@ c vari@@ ations that oc@@ cu@@ r in disease , in ill@@ ness , in w@@ ell@@ ness , and how our heal@@ th@@ care system actually oper@@ ates ."
That was what he was talking about on that quot@@ e .
And I would say he got it right almost a decad@@ e ago .
"So , I &apos;d very much like to see us beg@@ in to really se@@ ize this as an opport@@ un@@ ity to get this into our me@@ d@@ ical rec@@ or@@ ds ."
"So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : G@@ e@@ ograp@@ h@@ y always mat@@ ters ."
And I believe that ge@@ ograp@@ hi@@ c information can make both you and me very heal@@ thy . Thank you .

"So I was tra@@ ined to become a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast for two years in H@@ un@@ an , China in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
"When I was in the first gra@@ de , the government wanted to trans@@ f@@ er me to a school for a@@ th@@ le@@ t@@ es , all exp@@ en@@ ses pa@@ id ."

"A@@ n oper@@ a sing@@ er must start tra@@ ining young to learn ac@@ ro@@ b@@ a@@ tics , so I tri@@ ed everything I could to go to oper@@ a school ."
I even wr@@ ote to the school prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al and the h@@ ost of a ra@@ di@@ o show .
But no ad@@ ul@@ ts li@@ ked the idea .
No ad@@ ul@@ ts beli@@ ev@@ ed I was ser@@ i@@ ous .
"O@@ n@@ ly my friends sup@@ por@@ ted me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was ."
"So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be tra@@ ined ."
My dre@@ am would never come true .
I was af@@ ra@@ id that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d@@ -@@ cl@@ ass happ@@ iness would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so un@@ fa@@ ir .
So I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to find another call@@ ing .
N@@ o@@ body around to te@@ ach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to bo@@ o@@ ks .
I sa@@ tis@@ fi@@ ed my h@@ un@@ ger for par@@ ental adv@@ ice from this book by a family of writ@@ ers and mus@@ ici@@ ans . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ or@@ respon@@ d@@ ence in the F@@ am@@ ily of F@@ ou L@@ e@@ i &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my ro@@ le model of an in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent woman when Con@@ f@@ uc@@ i@@ an tra@@ di@@ tion re@@ qui@@ res o@@ be@@ dience . &#91; &quot; &quot; J@@ an@@ e E@@ y@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be eff@@ ici@@ ent from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ he@@ aper by the D@@ o@@ z@@ en &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was in@@ spi@@ red to study ab@@ ro@@ ad after read@@ ing these .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ om@@ ple@@ te W@@ or@@ ks of S@@ an@@ ma@@ o &quot; &quot; ( a@@ k@@ a E@@ ch@@ o Ch@@ an ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ ess@@ ons F@@ rom H@@ i@@ story &quot; &quot; by N@@ an H@@ u@@ a@@ i@@ j@@ in &#93; I came to the U.@@ S. in 199@@ 5 , so which bo@@ o@@ ks did I read here first ?"
"B@@ oo@@ ks ban@@ ned in China , of course ."
&quot; &quot; The G@@ ood Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chin@@ ese pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent for pro@@ p@@ ag@@ and@@ a . G@@ ot it .
"The B@@ i@@ ble is interesting , but str@@ an@@ ge ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a t@@ op@@ ic for a different day .
But the fi@@ f@@ th comm@@ and@@ ment gave me an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any : &quot; You sh@@ all h@@ on@@ or your father and mother . &quot;
"&quot; &quot; H@@ on@@ or , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than o@@ be@@ y . &quot; &quot; So it bec@@ omes my to@@ o@@ l to clim@@ b out of this Con@@ f@@ uc@@ i@@ an gu@@ il@@ t tra@@ p and to re@@ start my relation@@ ship with my parents ."
En@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing a new culture also started my ha@@ bit of com@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing .
It off@@ ers many in@@ si@@ ghts .
"For example , I found this ma@@ p out of place at first because this is what Chin@@ ese students gre@@ w up with ."
"It had never oc@@ cur@@ red to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the cen@@ ter of the world ."
A ma@@ p actually car@@ ri@@ es somebody &apos;s view .
C@@ om@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a st@@ and@@ ard pr@@ ac@@ tice in the ac@@ a@@ de@@ m@@ ic world .
There are even research fiel@@ ds such as com@@ par@@ ative reli@@ gi@@ on and com@@ par@@ ative liter@@ ature .
C@@ om@@ p@@ are and con@@ tr@@ ast gi@@ ves sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s a more comple@@ te underst@@ anding of a t@@ op@@ ic .
"So I thought , well , if com@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing works for research , why not do it in d@@ a@@ ily life too ?"
So I started read@@ ing bo@@ o@@ ks in pa@@ ir@@ s .
"So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in F@@ ran@@ k@@ l@@ in &quot; &quot; by W@@ al@@ ter I@@ sa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; J@@ o@@ h@@ n A@@ d@@ am@@ s &quot; &quot; by D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ c@@ C@@ ul@@ l@@ ough &#93; — who are invol@@ ved in the same ev@@ ent , or friends with shar@@ ed experi@@ ences ."

"For the B@@ u@@ dd@@ h@@ a , they are all p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical : l@@ ust , fe@@ ar and social du@@ ty — interesting ."
"So if you know a fore@@ ig@@ n language , it &apos;s also fu@@ n to read your fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite bo@@ o@@ ks in two langu@@ ages ."
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; The W@@ ay of Ch@@ u@@ an@@ g T@@ z@@ u &quot; &quot; Th@@ om@@ as M@@ er@@ ton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ a@@ o : The W@@ at@@ er@@ course W@@ ay &quot; &quot; Al@@ an W@@ at@@ ts &#93; In@@ stead of l@@ ost in trans@@ l@@ ation , I found there is much to g@@ ain ."

&quot; &quot; B@@ ri@@ de &quot; &quot; in Chin@@ ese liter@@ ally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; U@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h .
( Laughter ) B@@ oo@@ ks have given me a ma@@ gi@@ c port@@ al to con@@ n@@ ect with people of the past and the present .
I know I sh@@ all never feel lon@@ ely or power@@ less again .
H@@ a@@ ving a dre@@ am sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed really is nothing com@@ par@@ ed to what many others have su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed .
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only pur@@ p@@ ose of a dre@@ am .

"That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ig@@ n@@ ore fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all for the last couple of wee@@ ks ."

"But the one that &apos;s really been sort of st@@ res@@ sing me out , that I ha@@ ven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this ph@@ r@@ ase &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve g@@ one on@@ to T@@ w@@ it@@ ter in the last couple of wee@@ ks , you &apos;ve probably seen this ."
It &apos;s been a maj@@ or tr@@ en@@ ding t@@ op@@ ic .
"B@@ e@@ ing a mon@@ ol@@ in@@ gu@@ al American , I obvi@@ ously don &apos;t know what the ph@@ r@@ ase means ."
"So I went on@@ to T@@ w@@ it@@ ter , and I asked some people if they could expl@@ ain to me &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And for@@ tun@@ ately , my B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ an friends were more than ready to help ."

"It turns out that , not only is the G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o par@@ ro@@ t very at@@ trac@@ tive , us@@ e@@ ful for he@@ ad@@ dre@@ s@@ ses , it e@@ vi@@ d@@ ently has cer@@ tain h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic pro@@ per@@ ties , which means that there &apos;s a ter@@ ri@@ ble problem with G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o ab@@ use ."
S@@ ome s@@ ick and tw@@ ist@@ ed people have found themselves s@@ n@@ or@@ ting G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o .
And it &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ bly end@@ ang@@ er@@ ed .
"The good news about this is that the global community — again , my B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ an friends tell me — is p@@ it@@ ching in to help out ."
"It turns out that L@@ ad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a has re@@ le@@ as@@ ed a new single — actually five or six new sing@@ les , as ne@@ ar as I can tell — ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And my B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ an friends tell me that if I just tw@@ e@@ et the ph@@ r@@ ase &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o , &quot; &quot; 10 c@@ ents will be given to a global cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to sa@@ ve this r@@ are and beautiful b@@ ird ."
"Now , most of you have fi@@ gu@@ red out that this was a pr@@ ank , and actually a very , very good one ."
"&quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o &quot; &quot; actually means something very different ."
"In P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ ese , it means &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ut your m@@ outh , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And it speci@@ f@@ ically re@@ f@@ ers to this guy , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o B@@ u@@ en@@ o , who &apos;s the le@@ ad so@@ c@@ c@@ er comm@@ ent@@ ator for Re@@ de G@@ lob@@ o ."
And what I understand from my B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ an friends is that this guy is just a c@@ li@@ ch@@ e machine .
He can ru@@ in the most interesting mat@@ ch by just sp@@ ou@@ ting c@@ li@@ ch@@ e again and again and again .
"So B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ ans went to that first mat@@ ch against N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , put up this ban@@ ner , started a T@@ w@@ it@@ ter cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n and tri@@ ed to con@@ v@@ ince the rest of us to tw@@ e@@ et the ph@@ r@@ ase : &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so suc@@ cess@@ ful at this that it t@@ op@@ ped T@@ w@@ it@@ ter for two wee@@ ks ."
Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of l@@ ess@@ ons that you can take from this .
"And the first l@@ ess@@ on , which I think is a wor@@ th@@ while one , is that you can@@ not go wrong as@@ king people to be ac@@ tive on@@ line , so long as ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ s@@ m just means re@@ tw@@ e@@ e@@ ting a ph@@ r@@ ase ."
"So as long as ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ s@@ m is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with ."
"The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ ans on T@@ w@@ it@@ ter ."
There &apos;s more than five million of them .
"As far as national re@@ pres@@ en@@ tation , 11 percent of B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ an inter@@ net us@@ ers are on T@@ w@@ it@@ ter ."
That &apos;s a much high@@ er number than in the U.@@ S. or U.@@ K@@ .
"N@@ ext to J@@ ap@@ an , it &apos;s the second most re@@ pres@@ ented by population ."
"Now if you &apos;re using T@@ w@@ it@@ ter or other social net@@ works , and you didn &apos;t real@@ ize this was a space with a lot of B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ ans in it , you &apos;re like most of us ."
Because what happens on a social net@@ work is you inter@@ act with the people that you have ch@@ os@@ en to inter@@ act with .
"And if you are like me , a big , ge@@ e@@ k@@ y , wh@@ ite , American guy , you t@@ end to inter@@ act with a lot of other ge@@ e@@ k@@ y , wh@@ ite , American guys ."
And you don &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily have the sense that T@@ w@@ it@@ ter is in fact a very he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ an space .
"It &apos;s also extre@@ me@@ ly surpri@@ sing to many Amer@@ ic@@ ans , a he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American space ."
T@@ w@@ it@@ ter rec@@ ently did some research .
They looked at their local population .
They believe that 2@@ 4 percent of American T@@ w@@ it@@ ter us@@ ers are Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American .
That &apos;s about tw@@ ice as high as Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Amer@@ ic@@ ans are re@@ pres@@ ented in the population .
"And again , that was very sho@@ c@@ king to many T@@ w@@ it@@ ter us@@ ers , but it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be ."
And the reason it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into T@@ r@@ en@@ ding T@@ op@@ ics .
And you t@@ end to find t@@ op@@ ics that are almost enti@@ re@@ ly Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American conver@@ sa@@ tions .
"This was a vi@@ su@@ al@@ ization done by F@@ er@@ n@@ an@@ do V@@ i@@ e@@ g@@ as and Mar@@ ti@@ n W@@ at@@ ten@@ ber@@ g , two amazing vi@@ su@@ al@@ ization desig@@ n@@ ers , who looked at a wee@@ k@@ end &apos;s wor@@ th of T@@ w@@ it@@ ter tra@@ ff@@ ic and ess@@ enti@@ ally found that a lot of these tr@@ en@@ ding t@@ op@@ ics were basically se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated conver@@ sa@@ tions — and in ways that you w@@ ouldn &apos;t exp@@ ect ."
"It turns out that oil sp@@ ill is a m@@ os@@ tly wh@@ ite conver@@ sa@@ tion , that c@@ oo@@ k@@ out is a m@@ os@@ tly black conver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"And what &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y about this is that if you wanted to mi@@ x up who you were seeing on T@@ w@@ it@@ ter , it &apos;s liter@@ ally a qu@@ ick c@@ lic@@ k away ."
"You c@@ lic@@ k on that c@@ oo@@ k@@ out ta@@ g , there an enti@@ re@@ ly different conver@@ sa@@ tion with different people par@@ tici@@ p@@ ating in it ."
"But gener@@ ally spe@@ a@@ king , most of us don &apos;t ."
"We end up within these fil@@ ter bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es , as my friend E@@ l@@ i P@@ ar@@ is@@ er call@@ s them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are sim@@ il@@ ar to the people we already know ."
And we t@@ end not to see that wi@@ der picture .
"Now for me , I &apos;m surpri@@ sed by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the inter@@ net was sup@@ posed to be ."
"If you go back into the early days of the inter@@ net , when c@@ y@@ ber@@ -@@ ut@@ op@@ i@@ ans like N@@ ick N@@ e@@ gro@@ p@@ on@@ te were wr@@ iting big bo@@ o@@ ks like &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ ing D@@ ig@@ ital , &quot; &quot; the predic@@ tion was that the inter@@ net was going to be an incredi@@ bly powerful for@@ ce to s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h out cul@@ tur@@ al differ@@ ences , to put us all on a common fiel@@ d of one f@@ as@@ hi@@ on or another ."
N@@ e@@ gro@@ p@@ on@@ te started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connec@@ tions in the world of at@@ om@@ s .
He &apos;s at a technology conf@@ er@@ ence in F@@ l@@ or@@ id@@ a .
"And he &apos;s looking at something really , tru@@ ly ab@@ sur@@ d , which is bot@@ t@@ les of E@@ vi@@ an water on the table ."
And N@@ e@@ gro@@ p@@ on@@ te says this is cra@@ z@@ y .
This is the old econom@@ y .
"It &apos;s the econom@@ y of moving these he@@ av@@ y , s@@ low at@@ om@@ s over long dist@@ anc@@ es that &apos;s very difficult to do ."
"We &apos;re he@@ ad@@ ing to the future of b@@ its , where everything is spe@@ e@@ dy , it &apos;s we@@ igh@@ t@@ less ."
It can be any@@ where in the world at any time .
And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
"Now , N@@ e@@ gro@@ p@@ on@@ te has been right about a lot of things ."
He &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally wrong about this one .
It turns out that in many c@@ ases at@@ om@@ s are much more mo@@ bi@@ le than b@@ its .
"If I walk into a st@@ ore in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to bu@@ y water that &apos;s bot@@ t@@ led in F@@ i@@ j@@ i , shi@@ p@@ ped at great exp@@ en@@ se to the United States ."
It &apos;s actually surpri@@ sing@@ ly hard for me to see a F@@ i@@ j@@ i@@ an fe@@ ature fil@@ m .
It &apos;s really difficult for me to list@@ en to F@@ i@@ j@@ i@@ an music .
"It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly difficult for me to get F@@ i@@ j@@ i@@ an news , which is str@@ an@@ ge , because actually there &apos;s an en@@ orm@@ ous amoun@@ t going on in F@@ i@@ j@@ i ."
There &apos;s a cou@@ p government . There &apos;s a mil@@ it@@ ary government .
There &apos;s cr@@ ac@@ k@@ do@@ w@@ ns on the pres@@ s .
It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be p@@ ay@@ ing at@@ ten@@ tion to at the moment .
Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
I think that we t@@ end to look a lot at the in@@ fra@@ structure of glob@@ al@@ ization .
We look at the fra@@ me@@ work that makes it possible to live in this connec@@ ted world .
And that &apos;s a fra@@ me@@ work that inclu@@ des things like air@@ line rou@@ t@@ es .
It inclu@@ des things like the Internet c@@ ab@@ les .
"We look at a ma@@ p like this one , and it looks like the entire world is fl@@ at because everything is a h@@ op or two away ."
"You can get on a f@@ light in L@@ on@@ don , you can end up in B@@ ang@@ al@@ ore later today ."
"T@@ w@@ o hop@@ s , you &apos;re in S@@ u@@ v@@ a , the cap@@ it@@ o@@ l of F@@ i@@ j@@ i ."
It &apos;s all right there .
"When you start looking at what actually flo@@ ws on top of these net@@ works , you get a very different picture ."
"You start looking at how the global plan@@ e f@@ li@@ ghts move , and you su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly disco@@ ver that the world isn &apos;t even close to fl@@ at ."
It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly l@@ um@@ p@@ y .
"There are par@@ ts of the world that are very , very well connec@@ ted ."
There &apos;s basically a gi@@ ant pa@@ th@@ way in the sk@@ y between L@@ on@@ don and New York .
"@@ but look at this ma@@ p , and you can wat@@ ch this for , you know , two or three minutes ."
You won &apos;t see very many plan@@ es go from S@@ outh America to Africa .
And you &apos;ll disco@@ ver that there are par@@ ts of the g@@ lo@@ be that are sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tically c@@ ut off .
"When we stop looking at the in@@ fra@@ structure that makes connec@@ tion possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start real@@ iz@@ ing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does ."
So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interest@@ ed in in the last decad@@ e or so .
"The world is , in fact , getting more global ."
It &apos;s getting more connec@@ ted .
M@@ ore of problems are global in scale .
M@@ ore of our econom@@ ics is global in scale .
And our me@@ dia is less global by the day .
"If you wat@@ ched a t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast in the United States in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , 3@@ 5 to 40 percent of it would have been inter@@ national news on a ni@@ gh@@ tly new bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast ."
That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
And this ten@@ ds to give us a very di@@ stor@@ ted view of the world .
Here &apos;s a sli@@ de that A@@ li@@ s@@ a M@@ ill@@ er sho@@ wed at a pre@@ vi@@ ous TED T@@ al@@ k .
A@@ li@@ s@@ a &apos;s the pre@@ si@@ dent of P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o Inter@@ national .
"And she made a car@@ to@@ gra@@ m , which is basically a di@@ stor@@ ted ma@@ p based on what American t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion news ca@@ sts looked at for a mon@@ th ."
"And you see that when you dist@@ ort a ma@@ p based on at@@ ten@@ tion , the world within American t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion news is basically re@@ duc@@ ed to this gi@@ ant b@@ lo@@ ated U.@@ S@@ ."
and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed .
And that &apos;s basically what our me@@ dia is about .
"And before you con@@ clu@@ de that this is just a fun@@ c@@ tion of American T@@ V news — which is dre@@ ad@@ ful , and I ag@@ ree that it &apos;s dre@@ ad@@ ful — I &apos;ve been m@@ app@@ ing el@@ ite me@@ dia like the New York T@@ im@@ es , and I get the same thing ."
"When you look at the New York T@@ im@@ es , you look at other el@@ ite me@@ dia , what you lar@@ ge@@ ly get are pic@@ tures of very we@@ al@@ thy n@@ ations and the n@@ ations we &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed ."
It turns out that new me@@ dia isn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily hel@@ ping us all that much .
Here &apos;s a ma@@ p made by Mar@@ k G@@ ra@@ ha@@ m who &apos;s down the stre@@ et at the O@@ x@@ for@@ d Internet In@@ stitu@@ te .
A this is a ma@@ p of ar@@ tic@@ les in W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia that have been ge@@ o@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
And you &apos;ll no@@ tice that there &apos;s a very he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ wards N@@ or@@ th America and W@@ est@@ er@@ n Eu@@ rop@@ e .
"E@@ ven within W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ as , where we &apos;re cre@@ ating their own cont@@ ent on@@ line , there &apos;s a he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ wards the place where a lot of the W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia au@@ th@@ ors are based , rather than to the rest of the world ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , you can get up , you can pic@@ k up your computer when you get out of this s@@ es@@ sion , you could read a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper from India or from Au@@ str@@ al@@ ia , from C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , G@@ od for@@ b@@ id from the U.@@ S@@ ."
You probably won &apos;t .
"If you look at on@@ line me@@ dia con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion — in this case , in the top 10 us@@ ers of the inter@@ net — more than 9@@ 5 percent of the news read@@ er@@ ship is on d@@ om@@ es@@ tic news sit@@ es ."
"It &apos;s one of these r@@ are c@@ ases where the U.@@ S. is actually sli@@ gh@@ tly better than &#91; the U.@@ K@@ . &#93; , because we actually like read@@ ing your me@@ dia , rather than v@@ ice vers@@ a ."
So all of this star@@ ts lead@@ ing me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I re@@ f@@ er to as imag@@ in@@ ary cos@@ m@@ op@@ ol@@ it@@ an@@ ism .
We look at the inter@@ net .
We think we &apos;re getting this wi@@ de view of the g@@ lo@@ be .
"We oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally st@@ um@@ ble on@@ to a p@@ age in Chin@@ ese , and we deci@@ de that we do in fact have the gre@@ at@@ est technology ever built to con@@ n@@ ect us to the rest of the world ."
And we for@@ get that most of the time we &apos;re ch@@ ec@@ king B@@ os@@ ton R@@ ed S@@ o@@ x s@@ co@@ res .
"So this is a real problem — not just because the R@@ ed S@@ o@@ x are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to sol@@ ve are global in scale and sc@@ op@@ e , they re@@ qu@@ ire global conver@@ sa@@ tions to get to global solu@@ tions ."
This is a problem we have to sol@@ ve .
So here &apos;s the good news .
"For six years , I &apos;ve been h@@ ang@@ ing out with these guys ."
This is a group called G@@ lob@@ al V@@ o@@ ices .
This is a team of b@@ log@@ g@@ ers from around the world .
O@@ ur mis@@ sion was to fi@@ x the world &apos;s me@@ dia .
We started in 200@@ 4 .
"You might have no@@ tic@@ ed , we ha@@ ven &apos;t done all that well so far ."
"N@@ or do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to sol@@ ve the problem ."
"But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting l@@ ess@@ ons for how we would re@@ w@@ ire if we we wanted to use the we@@ b to have a wi@@ der world ."
The first thing you have to consi@@ der is that there are par@@ ts of the world that are dar@@ k sp@@ ots in terms of at@@ ten@@ tion .
In this case — the ma@@ p of the world at night by N@@ A@@ S@@ A — they &apos;re dar@@ k liter@@ ally because of l@@ ack of electr@@ ic@@ ity .
And I used to think that a dar@@ k sp@@ ot on this ma@@ p basically me@@ ant you &apos;re not going to get me@@ dia from there because there are more bas@@ ic needs .
"What I &apos;m star@@ ting to real@@ ize is that you can get me@@ dia , it &apos;s just an en@@ orm@@ ous amoun@@ t of work , and you need an en@@ orm@@ ous amoun@@ t of enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement ."
"One of those dar@@ k sp@@ ots is M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ car , a country which is gener@@ ally better known for the D@@ re@@ am@@ works fil@@ m than it is actually known for the lo@@ v@@ ely people who live there ."
And so the people who f@@ oun@@ ded F@@ o@@ k@@ o C@@ l@@ u@@ b in M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ car wer@@ en &apos;t actually con@@ cer@@ ned with trying to change the image of their country .
They were doing something much sim@@ pl@@ er .
It was a clu@@ b to learn En@@ g@@ li@@ sh and to learn compu@@ ters and the inter@@ net .
but what happened was that M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ car went through a viol@@ ent cou@@ p .
M@@ ost in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent me@@ dia was sh@@ ut down .
"And the high school students who were learning to b@@ lo@@ g through F@@ o@@ k@@ o C@@ l@@ u@@ b su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly found themselves talking to an inter@@ national au@@ dience about the de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tions , the viol@@ ence , everything that was going on within this country ."
"So a very , very small progra@@ m desig@@ ned to get people in front of compu@@ ters , publi@@ sh@@ ing their own thou@@ ghts , publi@@ sh@@ ing in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent me@@ dia , en@@ ded up having a huge imp@@ act on what we know about this country ."
Now the tr@@ ick with this is that I &apos;m gu@@ ess@@ ing most people here don &apos;t spe@@ ak M@@ al@@ ag@@ as@@ y .
"I &apos;m also gu@@ ess@@ ing that most of you don &apos;t even spe@@ ak Chin@@ ese — which is sort of sa@@ d if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most re@@ pres@@ ented language on the inter@@ net ."
F@@ or@@ tun@@ ately people are trying to figure out how to fi@@ x this .
"If you &apos;re using Google Ch@@ r@@ ome and you go to a Chin@@ ese language s@@ ite , you no@@ tice this really c@@ ut@@ e bo@@ x at the top , which au@@ tom@@ a@@ tically de@@ t@@ ec@@ ts that the p@@ age is in Chin@@ ese and very quickly at a m@@ ouse c@@ lic@@ k will give you a trans@@ l@@ ation of the p@@ age ."
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it &apos;s a machine trans@@ l@@ ation of the p@@ age ."
"And while Google is very , very good with some langu@@ ages , it &apos;s actually pretty dre@@ ad@@ ful with Chin@@ ese ."
And the res@@ ul@@ ts can be pretty fun@@ n@@ y .
"What you really want — what I really want , is ev@@ en@@ tually the ability to p@@ us@@ h a bu@@ t@@ ton and have this qu@@ e@@ u@@ ed so a human being can trans@@ l@@ ate this ."
"And if you think this is ab@@ sur@@ d , it &apos;s not ."
There &apos;s a group right now in China called Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an .
"And Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an is a group of 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers who get on@@ line every day ."
They look for the most interesting cont@@ ent in the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh language .
"They trans@@ l@@ ate rou@@ gh@@ ly 100 ar@@ tic@@ les a day from maj@@ or ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers , maj@@ or we@@ b@@ sit@@ es ."
They put it on@@ line for free .
"It &apos;s the project of a guy nam@@ ed Z@@ h@@ an@@ g L@@ e@@ i , who was living in the United States during the L@@ ha@@ s@@ a ri@@ ots and who couldn &apos;t believe how bi@@ as@@ ed American me@@ dia co@@ ver@@ age was ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start trans@@ l@@ ating , so that people between these countries start underst@@ anding each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an can line up 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 people to trans@@ l@@ ate the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh inter@@ net into Chin@@ ese , where &apos;s the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh language Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an ?"
"Wh@@ o &apos;s going after Chin@@ ese , which now has 4@@ 00 million inter@@ net us@@ ers out there ?"
My gu@@ ess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
"So even if we can find a way to trans@@ l@@ ate from Chin@@ ese , there &apos;s no gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e that we &apos;re going to find it ."
"When we look for information on@@ line , we basically have two str@@ ate@@ gi@@ es ."
We use a lot of sear@@ ch .
And sear@@ ch is ter@@ ri@@ fic if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
"But if what you &apos;re looking for is ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity , if you want to st@@ um@@ ble on@@ to something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our ma@@ in ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y is to look to our social net@@ works , to look for our friends ."
What are they looking at ? M@@ ay@@ be we should be looking at it .
The problem with this is that ess@@ enti@@ ally what you end up getting after a while is the w@@ is@@ dom of the f@@ loc@@ k .
"You end up f@@ loc@@ king with a lot of people who are probably sim@@ il@@ ar to you , who have sim@@ il@@ ar interest@@ s ."
"And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other f@@ loc@@ ks , from the other par@@ ts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interest@@ s ."
"T@@ o do this , at a cer@@ tain point , you need someone to b@@ um@@ p you out of your f@@ loc@@ k and into another f@@ loc@@ k ."
You need a gu@@ i@@ de .
So this is A@@ m@@ ir@@ a A@@ l H@@ us@@ sa@@ in@@ i . She is the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ed@@ it@@ or for G@@ lob@@ al V@@ o@@ ices .
She has one of the har@@ d@@ est j@@ ob@@ s in the world .
"N@@ ot only does she have to keep our I@@ s@@ ra@@ el@@ i and P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ i@@ an con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tors from kill@@ ing each other , she has to figure out what is going to inter@@ est you about the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ."
"And in that sense of trying to get you out of your norm@@ al or@@ bit , and to try to get you to p@@ ay at@@ ten@@ tion to a story about someone who &apos;s given up s@@ mo@@ king for the mon@@ th of R@@ ama@@ d@@ an , she has to know something about a global au@@ dience ."
She has to know something about what stories are av@@ a@@ il@@ able .
"B@@ as@@ ically , she &apos;s a de@@ e@@ j@@ ay ."
"S@@ he &apos;s a sk@@ ill@@ ed human cur@@ ator who kno@@ ws what materi@@ al is av@@ a@@ il@@ able to her , who &apos;s able to list@@ en to the au@@ dience , and who &apos;s able to make a sel@@ ection and p@@ us@@ h people for@@ ward in one f@@ as@@ hi@@ on or another ."
I don &apos;t think this is nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m@@ ic process .
I think what &apos;s great about the inter@@ net is that it actually makes it much eas@@ i@@ er for de@@ e@@ j@@ ays to re@@ ach a wi@@ der au@@ dience .
I know A@@ m@@ ir@@ a .
I can ask her what to read .
"But with the inter@@ net , she &apos;s in a posi@@ tion where she can tell a lot of people what to read ."
"And you can list@@ en to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interest@@ ed in having your we@@ b wi@@ d@@ en@@ ed ."
"So once you start wi@@ d@@ ening like this , once you start li@@ gh@@ ting up vo@@ ices in the dar@@ k sp@@ ots , once you start trans@@ l@@ ating , once you start cur@@ ating , you end up in some really we@@ ird places ."
"This is an image from pretty much my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite b@@ lo@@ g , which is A@@ fri@@ G@@ ad@@ get ."
And A@@ fri@@ G@@ ad@@ get is a b@@ lo@@ g that looks at technology in an Africa cont@@ ext .
"And speci@@ f@@ ically , it &apos;s looking at a bl@@ ac@@ k@@ sm@@ ith in K@@ i@@ ber@@ a in N@@ a@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i , who is tur@@ ning the s@@ ha@@ ft of a L@@ and@@ ro@@ ver into a co@@ ld ch@@ i@@ se@@ l ."
"And when you look at this image , you might find y@@ our@@ self going , &quot; Why would I con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ ably care about this ? &quot;"
"And the tru@@ th is , this guy can probably expl@@ ain this to you ."
This is E@@ ri@@ k H@@ er@@ sm@@ an . You guys may have seen him around the conf@@ er@@ ence .
He goes by the mon@@ i@@ ker Wh@@ ite Afr@@ ican .
"He &apos;s both a very well known American ge@@ e@@ k , but he &apos;s also K@@ en@@ y@@ an ; he was bor@@ n in S@@ u@@ d@@ an , gre@@ w up in K@@ en@@ y@@ a ."
He is a bri@@ dge figure .
"He is someone who liter@@ ally has fe@@ et in both wor@@ l@@ ds — one in the world of the Afr@@ ican technology community , one in the world of the American technology community ."
"And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this bl@@ ac@@ k@@ sm@@ ith in K@@ i@@ ber@@ a and turn it into a story about re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ing technology , about innov@@ ating from con@@ stra@@ int , about looking for in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion based on re@@ using materi@@ als ."
"He kno@@ ws one world , and he &apos;s fin@@ ding a way to communic@@ ate it to another world , both of which he has de@@ ep connec@@ tions to ."
"Th@@ ese bri@@ dge fi@@ gu@@ res , I &apos;m pretty well con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed , are the future of how we try to make the world wi@@ der through using the we@@ b ."
"But the tr@@ ick with bri@@ d@@ g@@ es is , ul@@ tim@@ ately , you need someone to cr@@ oss them ."
And that &apos;s where we start talking about x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ es .
"So if I found myself in the N@@ F@@ L , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect I would sp@@ end my off@@ -@@ se@@ as@@ on n@@ ur@@ sing my w@@ ounds , en@@ jo@@ ying my house , so on and so for@@ th — possi@@ bly rec@@ or@@ ding a hi@@ p@@ -@@ h@@ op al@@ bu@@ m ."
"D@@ h@@ an@@ i J@@ ones , who is the middle l@@ ine@@ bac@@ ker for the C@@ inc@@ in@@ nat@@ i B@@ eng@@ als , has a sli@@ gh@@ tly different appro@@ ach to the off@@ -@@ se@@ as@@ on ."
D@@ h@@ an@@ i has a t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion show .
"It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; D@@ h@@ an@@ i T@@ ac@@ k@@ les the G@@ lo@@ be . &quot; &quot; And every week on this t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion show , D@@ h@@ an@@ i tra@@ v@@ els to a different n@@ ation of the world ."
He fin@@ ds a local sp@@ or@@ ting team .
"He tra@@ ins with them for a week , and he pl@@ ays a mat@@ ch with them ."
And his reason for this is not just that he wan@@ ts to ma@@ ster M@@ u@@ ay T@@ ha@@ i bo@@ x@@ ing .
"It &apos;s because , for him , sp@@ ort is the language that allo@@ ws him to en@@ coun@@ ter the full wi@@ d@@ th and won@@ der of the world ."
F@@ or some of us it might be music . F@@ or some of us it might be food .
F@@ or a lot of us it might be liter@@ ature or wr@@ iting .
But there are all these different tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that al@@ low you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
The go@@ al of my T@@ al@@ k here is not to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the people in this room to em@@ br@@ ace your x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a .
"M@@ y gu@@ ess — given that you &apos;re at a conf@@ er@@ ence called TE@@ D@@ G@@ lob@@ al — is that most of you are x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ es , whether or not you use that ter@@ m ."
My chall@@ en@@ ge instead is this .
It &apos;s not enough to make the person@@ al deci@@ sion that you want a wi@@ der world .
We have to figure out how to re@@ w@@ ire the systems that we have .
We have to fi@@ x our me@@ dia .
We have to fi@@ x the inter@@ net . We have to fi@@ x our education .
We have to fi@@ x our im@@ m@@ ig@@ ra@@ tion po@@ lic@@ y .
"We need to look at ways of cre@@ ating ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity , of making trans@@ l@@ ation per@@ v@@ as@@ ive , and we need to find ways to em@@ br@@ ace and c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate these bri@@ dge fi@@ gu@@ res ."
And we need to figure out how to cul@@ tiv@@ ate x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ es .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
( Applause )
"B@@ as@@ ically , there &apos;s a maj@@ or demo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c ev@@ ent going on ."
And it may be that p@@ ass@@ ing the 50 percent ur@@ b@@ an point is an economic ti@@ p@@ ping point . So the world now is a ma@@ p of connec@@ tivity .
It used to be that P@@ ar@@ is and L@@ on@@ don and New York were the lar@@ g@@ est cities .
What we have now is the end of the ri@@ se of the W@@ est . That &apos;s over .
The ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate num@@ bers are over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
"So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , v@@ ill@@ ages of the world are emp@@ t@@ ying out ."
"The question is , why ?"
"And here &apos;s the un@@ r@@ om@@ an@@ tic tru@@ th — and the city air makes you free , they said in R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance G@@ er@@ many . So some people go to places like S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i but most go to the s@@ qu@@ at@@ ter cities where a@@ es@@ the@@ tics ru@@ le ."
And these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed by po@@ ver@@ ty .
They &apos;re people getting out of po@@ ver@@ ty as f@@ ast as they can .
"They &apos;re the d@@ om@@ in@@ ant buil@@ d@@ ers and to a large ex@@ t@@ ent , the d@@ om@@ in@@ ant desig@@ n@@ ers ."
They have h@@ om@@ e-@@ bre@@ wed in@@ fra@@ structure and vi@@ br@@ ant ur@@ b@@ an life .

"They are con@@ st@@ an@@ tly up@@ gra@@ ding , and in a few c@@ ases , the government hel@@ ps ."
E@@ duc@@ ation is the ma@@ in ev@@ ent that can happen in cities .
What &apos;s going on in the stre@@ et in M@@ um@@ b@@ a@@ i ?
A@@ l G@@ ore kno@@ ws . It &apos;s basically everything .
There &apos;s no un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment in s@@ qu@@ at@@ ter cities . E@@ very@@ one works .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ si@@ x@@ th of hum@@ an@@ ity is there . It &apos;s so@@ on going to be more than that .
So here &apos;s the first p@@ un@@ ch line : cities have de@@ f@@ used the population b@@ om@@ b .
And here &apos;s the second p@@ un@@ ch line .
That &apos;s the news from do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn . Here it is in per@@ spec@@ tive .
St@@ ar@@ s have sh@@ ined down on ear@@ th &apos;s life for b@@ illions of years .
Now we &apos;re sh@@ ining right back up .

"The night before I was he@@ ad@@ ing for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land , I was inv@@ ited to h@@ ost the fin@@ al of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s G@@ ot T@@ al@@ ent &quot; &quot; show in S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i with the 8@@ 0,000 live au@@ dience in the sta@@ di@@ um ."

It means &quot; &quot; gre@@ en on@@ ion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?

"( Laughter ) And the last s@@ ent@@ ence of N@@ es@@ su@@ n D@@ orm@@ a that she was sing@@ ing in the sta@@ di@@ um was &quot; &quot; gre@@ en on@@ ion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; S@@ us@@ an B@@ o@@ y@@ le was saying that , 8@@ 0,000 live au@@ dience s@@ an@@ g together ."
That was h@@ il@@ ari@@ ous .
So I gu@@ ess both S@@ us@@ an B@@ o@@ y@@ le and this ve@@ ge@@ table v@@ end@@ or in S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ed to o@@ ther@@ ness .
"They were the least exp@@ ected to be suc@@ cess@@ ful in the business called en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , yet their cou@@ ra@@ ge and tal@@ ent b@@ rou@@ ght them through ."
And a show and a pl@@ at@@ form gave them the st@@ age to real@@ ize their dre@@ am@@ s .
"Well , being different is not that difficult ."
We are all different from different per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ves .
"But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view ."
You may have the chan@@ ce to make a difference .
"M@@ y gener@@ ation has been very for@@ tun@@ ate to w@@ it@@ ness and par@@ tici@@ p@@ ate in the hi@@ stor@@ ic trans@@ for@@ mation of China that has made so many chang@@ es in the past 20 , 30 years ."
"I remember that in the year of 199@@ 0 , when I was gra@@ du@@ ating from col@@ le@@ ge , I was ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job in the s@@ al@@ es de@@ par@@ t@@ ment of the first fi@@ v@@ e-@@ st@@ ar h@@ ot@@ el in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , Gre@@ at W@@ all S@@ her@@ at@@ on — it &apos;s still there ."
"So after being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated by this J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese manag@@ er for a half an h@@ our , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , M@@ is@@ s Y@@ an@@ g , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I sum@@ mon@@ ed my cou@@ ra@@ ge and po@@ ise and said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , but could you let me know , what actually do you s@@ ell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a cl@@ ue what a s@@ al@@ es de@@ par@@ t@@ ment was about in a fi@@ v@@ e-@@ st@@ ar h@@ ot@@ el ."
That was the first day I set my f@@ oo@@ t in a fi@@ v@@ e-@@ st@@ ar h@@ ot@@ el .
"A@@ rou@@ nd the same time , I was going through an au@@ di@@ tion — the first ever open au@@ di@@ tion by national t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion in China — with another thous@@ and col@@ le@@ ge gir@@ ls ."
"The produc@@ er told us they were looking for some s@@ we@@ et , in@@ no@@ cent and beautiful f@@ res@@ h face ."
"So when it was my turn , I st@@ ood up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s person@@ ali@@ ties on t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion always have to be beautiful , s@@ we@@ et , in@@ no@@ cent and , you know , sup@@ por@@ tive ?"
Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own vo@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of off@@ en@@ ded them .
"But actually , they were im@@ pres@@ sed by my words ."
"And so I was in the second rou@@ nd of com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , and then the third and the f@@ our@@ th ."
"A@@ f@@ ter se@@ ven r@@ ounds of com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , I was the last one to survi@@ ve it ."
So I was on a national t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion pri@@ me@@ -@@ time show .
"And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chin@@ ese t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion that allo@@ wed its h@@ os@@ ts to spe@@ ak out of their own min@@ ds without read@@ ing an appro@@ ved sc@@ ri@@ pt ."
( Applause ) And my wee@@ k@@ ly au@@ dience at that time was between 2@@ 00 to 3@@ 00 million people .
"Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.@@ S. and C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a U@@ ni@@ versity to pur@@ su@@ e my pos@@ t@@ gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ dies , and then started my own me@@ dia company , which was un@@ thought of during the years that I started my care@@ er ."
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve inter@@ vi@@ e@@ wed more than a thous@@ and people in the past .
"And sometimes I have young people appro@@ ach@@ ing me say , &quot; &quot; L@@ an , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel p@@ rou@@ d of that ."
But then we are also so for@@ tun@@ ate to w@@ it@@ ness the trans@@ for@@ mation of the whole country .
I was in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing &apos;s bi@@ d@@ ding for the O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ ic G@@ am@@ es .
I was re@@ pres@@ en@@ ting the S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i E@@ x@@ p@@ o .
I saw China em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing the world and v@@ ice vers@@ a .
"But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young gener@@ ation up to ?"
"@@ How are they different , and what are the differ@@ ences they are going to make to sh@@ ape the future of China , or at large , the world ?"
So today I want to talk about young people through the pl@@ at@@ form of social me@@ dia .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?"
"Well this is a girl called G@@ u@@ o M@@ ei@@ me@@ i — 20 years old , beautiful ."
"S@@ he sho@@ wed off her exp@@ en@@ sive b@@ ag@@ s , c@@ lo@@ th@@ es and car on her micro@@ b@@ lo@@ g , which is the Chin@@ ese ver@@ sion of T@@ w@@ it@@ ter ."
And she cl@@ a@@ im@@ ed to be the gener@@ al manag@@ er of R@@ ed C@@ r@@ oss at the C@@ ha@@ m@@ ber of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce .
"S@@ he didn &apos;t real@@ ize that she ste@@ p@@ ped on a sen@@ si@@ tive ner@@ ve and ar@@ ous@@ ed national ques@@ tion@@ ing , almost a tur@@ mo@@ il , against the cre@@ di@@ bility of R@@ ed C@@ r@@ oss ."
"The contro@@ vers@@ y was so he@@ ated that the R@@ ed C@@ r@@ oss had to open a pres@@ s conf@@ er@@ ence to cl@@ ari@@ f@@ y it , and the inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ation is going on ."
"So far , as of today , we know that she her@@ self made up that ti@@ tle — probably because she fe@@ els p@@ rou@@ d to be as@@ soci@@ ated with char@@ ity ."
"A@@ ll those exp@@ en@@ sive it@@ ems were given to her as gi@@ f@@ ts by her bo@@ y@@ friend , who used to be a bo@@ ard member in a sub@@ divi@@ sion of R@@ ed C@@ r@@ oss at C@@ ha@@ m@@ ber of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce ."
It &apos;s very comp@@ lic@@ ated to expl@@ ain .
"But any@@ way , the public still doesn &apos;t bu@@ y it ."
It is still bo@@ il@@ ing .
"It sho@@ ws us a gener@@ al mi@@ str@@ ust of government or govern@@ m@@ ent@@ -@@ bac@@ ked institu@@ tions , which l@@ ac@@ ked tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ency in the past ."
And also it sho@@ wed us the power and the imp@@ act of social me@@ dia as micro@@ b@@ lo@@ g .
"M@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ lo@@ g bo@@ om@@ ed in the year of 20@@ 10 , with vi@@ sit@@ ors d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed and time sp@@ ent on it tri@@ pl@@ ed ."
"S@@ in@@ a@@ .@@ co@@ m , a maj@@ or news port@@ al , al@@ one has more than 1@@ 40 million micro@@ b@@ log@@ g@@ ers ."
"O@@ n T@@ en@@ cent , 2@@ 00 million ."
"The most pop@@ ular b@@ log@@ ger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movi@@ e st@@ ar , and she has more than 9@@ .@@ 5 million fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ers , or f@@ ans ."
"A@@ b@@ out 80 percent of those micro@@ b@@ log@@ g@@ ers are young people , under 30 years old ."
"And because , as you know , the tra@@ di@@ tional me@@ dia is still he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly contro@@ l@@ led by the government , social me@@ dia off@@ ers an op@@ ening to let the ste@@ am out a little bit ."
"But because you don &apos;t have many other op@@ en@@ ings , the he@@ at coming out of this op@@ ening is sometimes very str@@ ong , ac@@ tive and even viol@@ ent ."
"So through micro@@ b@@ log@@ g@@ ing , we are able to understand Chin@@ ese y@@ outh even better ."
So how are they different ?
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , most of them were bor@@ n in the 8@@ 0s and 9@@ 0s , under the on@@ e-@@ child po@@ lic@@ y ."
"And because of sel@@ ected ab@@ or@@ tion by famili@@ es who fa@@ vo@@ red bo@@ ys to gir@@ ls , now we have en@@ ded up with 30 million more young men than women ."
"That could p@@ ose a pot@@ ential d@@ an@@ ger to the society , but who kno@@ ws ; we &apos;re in a glob@@ al@@ ized world , so they can look for gir@@ l@@ friends from other countries ."
M@@ ost of them have fa@@ ir@@ ly good education .
The il@@ liter@@ acy r@@ ate in China am@@ ong this gener@@ ation is under one percent .
"In cities , 80 percent of kids go to col@@ le@@ ge ."
"But they are fac@@ ing an ag@@ ing China with a population ab@@ o@@ ve 6@@ 5 years old coming up with se@@ ven@@ -@@ po@@ int@@ -@@ some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 20@@ 30 ."
"And you know we have the tra@@ di@@ tion that youn@@ ger gener@@ ations sup@@ port the el@@ d@@ ers fin@@ anci@@ ally , and taking care of them when they &apos;re s@@ ick ."
So it means young cou@@ ples will have to sup@@ port four parents who have a life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y of 7@@ 3 years old .
So making a living is not that easy for young people .
C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ates are not in sh@@ ort sup@@ ply .
"In ur@@ b@@ an are@@ as , col@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ates find the star@@ ting s@@ al@@ ary is about 4@@ 00 U.@@ S. dollars a mon@@ th , while the a@@ ver@@ age r@@ ent is ab@@ o@@ ve $ 500 ."
"So what do they do ? They have to share space — s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ ed in very lim@@ ited space to sa@@ ve money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tri@@ be of ants . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get mar@@ ri@@ ed and bu@@ y their ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment , they fi@@ gu@@ red out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to aff@@ ord their first ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment ."
"That ra@@ ti@@ o in America would only cost a couple five years to ear@@ n , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the sk@@ y@@ ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ting real est@@ ate pr@@ ice ."
"A@@ m@@ ong the 2@@ 00 million m@@ ig@@ r@@ ant wor@@ kers , 60 percent of them are young people ."
They find themselves sort of s@@ and@@ w@@ ic@@ h@@ ed between the ur@@ b@@ an are@@ as and the r@@ ural are@@ as .
"M@@ ost of them don &apos;t want to go back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , but they don &apos;t have the sense of b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ing ."
"They work for longer hours with less in@@ come , less social w@@ el@@ f@@ are ."
"And they &apos;re more v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able to job l@@ os@@ ses , sub@@ ject to in@@ fl@@ ation , ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing lo@@ ans from ban@@ ks , ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of the r@@ en@@ min@@ b@@ i , or dec@@ line of de@@ m@@ and from Eu@@ rop@@ e or America for the produc@@ ts they pro@@ duce ."
"L@@ ast year , though , an app@@ all@@ ing in@@ ci@@ dent in a s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n O@@ E@@ M man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing comp@@ ound in China : 1@@ 3 young wor@@ kers in their l@@ ate te@@ ens and early 20@@ s comm@@ it@@ ted su@@ ici@@ de , just one by one like ca@@ using a cont@@ ag@@ i@@ ous disease ."
But they died because of all different person@@ al reas@@ ons .
"But this whole in@@ ci@@ dent ar@@ ous@@ ed a huge out@@ cr@@ y from society about the is@@ ol@@ ation , both phys@@ ical and m@@ ental , of these m@@ ig@@ r@@ ant wor@@ kers ."
"For those who do re@@ turn back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , they find themselves very w@@ el@@ come loc@@ ally , because with the know@@ le@@ dge , sk@@ ill@@ s and net@@ works they have learned in the cities , with the as@@ si@@ st@@ ance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more j@@ ob@@ s , up@@ gra@@ de local ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and create new business in the less develop@@ ed market ."
"So for the past few years , the co@@ ast@@ al are@@ as , they found themselves in a sh@@ or@@ t@@ age of l@@ ab@@ or ."
These di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms show a more gener@@ al social bac@@ k@@ ground .
"The first one is the En@@ g@@ els co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent , which expl@@ a@@ ins that the cost of d@@ a@@ ily nec@@ es@@ si@@ ties has d@@ rop@@ ped its per@@ cent@@ age all through the past decad@@ e , in terms of family in@@ come , to about 3@@ 7@@ -@@ some percent ."
"But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 3@@ 9 percent , in@@ dic@@ ating a ri@@ sing living cost ."
The G@@ in@@ i co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent has already p@@ ass@@ ed the d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous line of 0@@ .@@ 4 .
Now it &apos;s 0@@ .@@ 5 — even wor@@ se than that in America — sho@@ wing us the in@@ come in@@ equ@@ ality .
And so you see this whole society getting f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated about l@@ os@@ ing some of its mo@@ bility .
"And also , the b@@ it@@ ter@@ ness and even res@@ ent@@ ment to@@ wards the r@@ ich and the powerful is quite wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ."
So any acc@@ us@@ ations of cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion or bac@@ k@@ do@@ or de@@ al@@ ings between au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties or business would ar@@ ouse a social out@@ cr@@ y or even un@@ rest .
"So through some of the h@@ ot@@ test t@@ op@@ ics on micro@@ b@@ log@@ g@@ ing , we can see what young people care most about ."
S@@ o@@ ci@@ al j@@ us@@ tice and government ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability run@@ s the first in what they de@@ m@@ and .
"For the past decad@@ e or so , a m@@ as@@ sive ur@@ ban@@ ization and develop@@ ment have let us w@@ it@@ ness a lot of re@@ por@@ ts on the for@@ c@@ ed demo@@ li@@ tion of pri@@ v@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ty ."
And it has ar@@ ous@@ ed huge an@@ ger and f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion am@@ ong our young gener@@ ation .
"S@@ ome@@ times people get kill@@ ed , and sometimes people set themselves on fir@@ e to prot@@ est ."
"So when these in@@ ci@@ d@@ ents are re@@ por@@ ted more and more fre@@ qu@@ ently on the Internet , people cr@@ y for the government to take ac@@ tions to stop this ."
"So the good news is that ear@@ li@@ er this year , the state coun@@ ci@@ l p@@ ass@@ ed a new reg@@ ulation on house re@@ qui@@ si@@ tion and demo@@ li@@ tion and p@@ ass@@ ed the right to order for@@ c@@ ed demo@@ li@@ tion from local govern@@ ments to the cour@@ t ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , many other issu@@ es con@@ cer@@ ning public sa@@ fe@@ ty is a h@@ ot t@@ op@@ ic on the Internet ."
"We heard about pol@@ l@@ u@@ ted air , pol@@ l@@ u@@ ted water , po@@ is@@ on@@ ed food ."
"And gu@@ ess what , we have fa@@ ked be@@ e@@ f ."
"They have sor@@ ts of in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that you br@@ us@@ h on a piece of ch@@ ic@@ ken or fish , and it turns it to look like be@@ e@@ f ."
"And then l@@ ately , people are very con@@ cer@@ ned about c@@ oo@@ king oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; re@@ fin@@ ing &#93; c@@ oo@@ king oil from re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant s@@ lo@@ p ."
So all these things have ar@@ ous@@ ed a huge out@@ cr@@ y from the Internet .
"And for@@ tun@@ ately , we have seen the government respon@@ ding more ti@@ me@@ ly and also more fre@@ qu@@ ently to the public con@@ cer@@ ns ."
"Wh@@ ile young people see@@ m to be very sure about their par@@ tici@@ p@@ ation in public po@@ lic@@ y-@@ making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit l@@ ost in terms of what they want for their person@@ al life ."
China is so@@ on to p@@ ass the U.@@ S.
as the number one market for l@@ u@@ x@@ ury br@@ ands — that &apos;s not inclu@@ ding the Chin@@ ese exp@@ end@@ it@@ u@@ res in Eu@@ rop@@ e and el@@ se@@ where .
"But you know what , half of those con@@ sum@@ ers are ear@@ ning a s@@ al@@ ary b@@ el@@ ow 2@@ ,000 U.@@ S. dollars ."
They &apos;re not r@@ ich at all .
They &apos;re taking those b@@ ag@@ s and c@@ lo@@ th@@ es as a sense of id@@ enti@@ ty and social st@@ at@@ us .
And this is a girl exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly saying on a T@@ V d@@ ating show that she would rather cr@@ y in a B@@ M@@ W than sm@@ ile on a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
"But of course , we do have young people who would still pre@@ f@@ er to sm@@ ile , whether in a B@@ M@@ W or &#91; on &#93; a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle ."
"So in the next picture , you see a very pop@@ ular ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called &quot; &quot; na@@ ked &quot; &quot; we@@ d@@ ding , or &quot; &quot; na@@ ked &quot; &quot; mar@@ ri@@ age ."
"It does not mean they will we@@ ar nothing in the we@@ d@@ ding , but it sho@@ ws that these young cou@@ ples are ready to get mar@@ ri@@ ed without a house , without a car , without a di@@ am@@ on@@ d r@@ ing and without a we@@ d@@ ding ban@@ qu@@ et , to show their comm@@ it@@ ment to true love ."
"And also , people are doing good through social me@@ dia ."
And the first picture sho@@ wed us that a tr@@ uc@@ k c@@ ag@@ ing 500 h@@ om@@ el@@ ess and k@@ id@@ n@@ app@@ ed do@@ gs for food pro@@ cess@@ ing was sp@@ ot@@ ted and st@@ op@@ ped on the high@@ way with the whole country wat@@ ching through micro@@ b@@ log@@ g@@ ing .
"P@@ e@@ ople were d@@ on@@ ating money , do@@ g food and off@@ ering vol@@ un@@ te@@ er work to stop that tr@@ uc@@ k ."
"And after hours of ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation , 500 do@@ gs were re@@ sc@@ u@@ ed ."
And here also people are hel@@ ping to find mis@@ sing children .
A father pos@@ ted his son &apos;s picture on@@ to the Internet .
"A@@ f@@ ter thousands of re@@ sen@@ ds in rel@@ ay , the child was found , and we w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed the re@@ uni@@ on of the family through micro@@ b@@ log@@ g@@ ing ."
So happ@@ iness is the most pop@@ ular word we have heard through the past two years .
"H@@ app@@ iness is not only rel@@ ated to person@@ al experi@@ ences and person@@ al val@@ ues , but also , it &apos;s about the environment ."
P@@ e@@ ople are thinking about the fol@@ lo@@ wing questions : A@@ re we going to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice our environment f@@ ur@@ ther to pro@@ duce high@@ er G@@ D@@ P ?
"@@ How are we going to per@@ form our social and poli@@ tical re@@ form to keep p@@ ace with economic growth , to keep su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability and st@@ ability ?"
"And also , how cap@@ able is the system of self-@@ cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness to keep more people cont@@ ent with all sor@@ ts of fr@@ ic@@ tion going on at the same time ?"
I gu@@ ess these are the questions people are going to answer .
And our youn@@ ger gener@@ ation are going to trans@@ form this country while at the same time being trans@@ form@@ ed themselves .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
This back here was my brain cancer .
I@@ s@@ n &apos;t it n@@ ice ?
"( Laughter ) The key ph@@ r@@ ase is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; ph@@ ew ."
"( Applause ) H@@ a@@ ving brain cancer was really , as you can imagine , sho@@ c@@ king news for me ."
I knew nothing about cancer .
"In W@@ est@@ er@@ n cul@@ tures , when you have cancer , it &apos;s as if you dis@@ appe@@ ar in a way ."
"@@ Y@@ our life as a comple@@ x human being is re@@ plac@@ ed by me@@ d@@ ical data : Y@@ our imag@@ es , your exam@@ s , your la@@ b val@@ ues , a li@@ st of me@@ dic@@ ines ."
And everyone chang@@ es as well .
You su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly become a disease on le@@ gs .
D@@ oc@@ tors start spe@@ a@@ king a language which you don &apos;t understand .
They start poin@@ ting their f@@ ing@@ ers at your body and your imag@@ es .
"P@@ e@@ ople start chang@@ ing as well because they start de@@ al@@ ing with the disease , instead of with the human being ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; What did the doc@@ tor say ? &quot; &quot; before even saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ell@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in the me@@ an@@ while , you &apos;re left with questions to which no@@ body gi@@ ves an answer ."
These are the &quot; &quot; C@@ an I ? &quot; &quot; questions : C@@ an I work while I have cancer ?
C@@ an I study ? C@@ an I make love ? C@@ an I be cre@@ ative ?
"And you won@@ der , &quot; &quot; What have I done to des@@ er@@ ve this ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I change something about my li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I do something ?"
"A@@ re there any other op@@ tions ? &quot; &quot; And , obvi@@ ously , doc@@ tors are the good guys in all these sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os , because they are very prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al and de@@ dic@@ ated to cur@@ ing you ."
"But they also are very used to having to de@@ al with patients , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes l@@ ose the idea that this is t@@ or@@ ture for you and that you become , liter@@ ally , a pati@@ ent — &quot; pati@@ ent &quot; means &quot; the one who wa@@ its . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) Th@@ ings are chang@@ ing , but cl@@ ass@@ ically , they t@@ end to not eng@@ age you in any way to learn about your con@@ di@@ tion , to get your friends and family eng@@ ag@@ ed , or sho@@ wing you ways in which you can change your li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le to min@@ im@@ ize the ris@@ ks of what you &apos;re going through ."
"But instead , you &apos;re for@@ c@@ ed there to wa@@ it in the h@@ ands of a ser@@ ies of very prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al str@@ ang@@ ers ."
"Wh@@ ile I was in the h@@ osp@@ ital , I asked for a prin@@ te@@ d@@ -@@ out picture of my cancer and I sp@@ o@@ ke with it ."
"It was really hard to ob@@ tain , because it &apos;s not common pr@@ ac@@ tice to ask for a picture of your own cancer ."
"I tal@@ ked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me ."
There &apos;s more to me .
"A c@@ ure , wh@@ ic@@ he@@ ver it is , will have to de@@ al with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the h@@ osp@@ ital against me@@ d@@ ical adv@@ ice ."
I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to change my relation@@ ship with the cancer and I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as dr@@ as@@ tic as a sur@@ g@@ ery .
"I &apos;m an arti@@ st , I use se@@ ver@@ al for@@ ms of op@@ en@@ -@@ sour@@ ce techno@@ logi@@ es and open information in my pr@@ ac@@ tice ."
"So my best be@@ t was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be acc@@ ess@@ ed by any@@ one ."
"So I created a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , which is called L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a , on which I put my me@@ d@@ ical data , on@@ line ."
I actually had to h@@ ack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another spe@@ ec@@ h .
"( Laughter ) I ch@@ ose this word , L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a — L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a in I@@ tal@@ i@@ an means &quot; &quot; the c@@ ure &quot; &quot; — because in many different cul@@ tures , the word &quot; &quot; c@@ ure &quot; &quot; can mean many different things ."
"In our W@@ est@@ er@@ n cul@@ tures , it means er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ating or re@@ ver@@ sing a disease , but in different cul@@ tures , for example , a culture from A@@ si@@ a , from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an , from L@@ a@@ ti@@ n countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things ."
"O@@ f course , I was interest@@ ed in the op@@ in@@ i@@ ons of doc@@ tors and heal@@ th@@ care provi@@ d@@ ers , but I was also interest@@ ed in the c@@ ure of the arti@@ st , of the po@@ et , of the desig@@ ner , of , who kno@@ ws , the mus@@ ici@@ ans ."
"I was interest@@ ed in the social c@@ ure , I was interest@@ ed in the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical c@@ ure , I was interest@@ ed in the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual c@@ ure , I was interest@@ ed in the emo@@ tional c@@ ure , I was interest@@ ed in any form of c@@ ure ."
"And , it worked ."
The L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite went vir@@ al .
"I re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved lots of me@@ dia at@@ ten@@ tion from I@@ tal@@ y and from ab@@ ro@@ ad and I quickly re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved more than 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 cont@@ ac@@ ts — e@@ ma@@ il@@ s , social net@@ working — most of them were a su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion on how to c@@ ure my cancer , but more of them were about how to c@@ ure myself as a full individu@@ al ."
"For example , many thousands of vide@@ os , imag@@ es , pic@@ tures , art per@@ form@@ anc@@ es were produc@@ ed for L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a ."
"For example , here we see F@@ r@@ anc@@ es@@ c@@ a F@@ in@@ i in her per@@ form@@ ance ."
"O@@ r , as arti@@ st P@@ at@@ r@@ ick L@@ ic@@ h@@ ty has done : He produc@@ ed a 3@@ D sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture of my tu@@ m@@ or and put it on s@@ ale on Th@@ in@@ gi@@ verse ."
"Now you can have my cancer , too !"
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich is a n@@ ice thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer ."
"And this was going on — scienti@@ sts , the tra@@ di@@ tional me@@ dic@@ ine exper@@ ts , se@@ ver@@ al resear@@ ch@@ ers , doc@@ tors — all connec@@ ted with me to give adv@@ ice ."
"W@@ ith all this information and sup@@ port , I was able to form a team of se@@ ver@@ al neur@@ os@@ ur@@ ge@@ ons , tra@@ di@@ tional doc@@ tors , on@@ co@@ logi@@ sts , and se@@ ver@@ al hund@@ red vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with wh@@ om I was able to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s the information I was re@@ ce@@ i@@ ving , which is very important ."
"And together , we were able to form a str@@ ate@@ gy for my own c@@ ure in many langu@@ ages , ac@@ cor@@ ding to many cul@@ tures ."
"And the curr@@ ent str@@ ate@@ gy sp@@ ans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite re@@ mar@@ k@@ able for me ."
"@@ &#91; S@@ ur@@ g@@ ery &#93; The fol@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ up M@@ R@@ I@@ s sho@@ wed , l@@ uc@@ k@@ ily , little to no growth of the cancer ."
So I was able to take my time and cho@@ ose .
"I ch@@ ose the doc@@ tor I wanted to work with , I ch@@ ose the h@@ osp@@ ital I wanted to st@@ ay in , and in the me@@ an@@ while , I was sup@@ por@@ ted by thousands of people , n@@ one of wh@@ om felt p@@ ity for me ."
"E@@ very@@ one felt like they could take an ac@@ tive ro@@ le in hel@@ ping me to get well , and this was the most important part of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a ."
What are the out@@ comes ?
"I &apos;m f@@ ine , as you can see , pretty f@@ ine ."
"( Applause ) I had exc@@ ell@@ ent news after the sur@@ g@@ ery — I have — I had a very lo@@ w@@ -@@ gra@@ de g@@ li@@ om@@ a , which is a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; kind of cancer which doesn &apos;t gro@@ w a lot ."
I have completely changed my life and my li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le .
E@@ very@@ thing I did was thou@@ gh@@ t@@ fully desig@@ ned to get me eng@@ ag@@ ed .
"@@ U@@ p until the very last few minutes of the sur@@ g@@ ery , which was very in@@ ten@@ se , a mat@@ ri@@ x of elec@@ t@@ ro@@ des was im@@ plan@@ ted in my brain from this side , to be able to build a fun@@ c@@ tional ma@@ p of what the brain contro@@ ls ."
"And right before the oper@@ ation , we were able to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s the fun@@ c@@ tional ma@@ p of my brain with the doc@@ tor , to understand which ris@@ ks I was run@@ ning into and if there were any I wanted to av@@ o@@ id ."
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , there were ."
&#91; O@@ p@@ en &#93; And this op@@ en@@ ness was really the fund@@ am@@ ental part of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a .
"Th@@ ous@@ ands of people shar@@ ed their stories , their experi@@ ences ."
D@@ oc@@ tors got to talk with people they don &apos;t us@@ u@@ ally con@@ s@@ ult when they think about cancer .
"I &apos;m a self-@@ f@@ oun@@ ding , contin@@ u@@ ous state of trans@@ l@@ ation am@@ ong many different langu@@ ages , in which science me@@ ets emo@@ tion and con@@ ven@@ tional research me@@ ets tra@@ di@@ tional research ."
&#91; S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety &#93; The most important thing of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a was to feel like a part of a really eng@@ ag@@ ed and connec@@ ted society wh@@ ose w@@ ell@@ ness really dep@@ ends on the w@@ ell@@ ness of all of its comp@@ on@@ ents .
This global per@@ form@@ ance is my op@@ en@@ -@@ sour@@ ce c@@ ure for cancer .
"And from what I feel , it &apos;s a c@@ ure for me , but for us all ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
"A big chall@@ en@@ ge is , how should the i@@ P@@ ads be used , and what app@@ s should we put on the i@@ P@@ ads ?"
H@@ i everybody . So my name is M@@ a@@ c .
"I wr@@ ite children &apos;s bo@@ o@@ ks , and there &apos;s a quot@@ e from P@@ ab@@ l@@ o P@@ ic@@ as@@ so , &quot; &quot; We all know that Ar@@ t is not tru@@ th ."
Ar@@ t is a li@@ e that makes us real@@ ize tru@@ th or at least the tru@@ th that is given us to understand .
"The arti@@ st must know the man@@ ner wh@@ er@@ e@@ by to con@@ v@@ ince others of the tru@@ th@@ ful@@ ness of his li@@ es . &quot; &quot; I first heard this when I was a k@@ id , and I lo@@ ved it , but I had no idea what it me@@ ant ."
"( Laughter ) So I thought , you know what , it &apos;s what I &apos;m here to talk to you today about , though , tru@@ th and li@@ es , fic@@ tion and reality ."
So how could I un@@ t@@ ang@@ le this k@@ n@@ ot@@ ted b@@ un@@ ch of s@@ ent@@ ences ?
"And I said , I &apos;ve got P@@ o@@ wer@@ P@@ o@@ int . Let &apos;s do a V@@ en@@ n di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m ."
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ ru@@ th . L@@ ies . &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) So there it is , right there , bo@@ om ."
"We &apos;ve got tru@@ th and li@@ es and then there &apos;s this little space , the ed@@ ge , in the middle ."
"That li@@ min@@ al space , that &apos;s art ."
A@@ ll right . V@@ en@@ n di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very hel@@ p@@ ful ei@@ ther .
"The thing that made me understand that quot@@ e and really kind of what art , at least the art of fic@@ tion , was , was working with kids ."
I used to be a sum@@ m@@ er cam@@ p coun@@ sel@@ or .
"I would do it on my sum@@ m@@ ers off from col@@ le@@ ge , and I lo@@ ved it ."
It was a sp@@ or@@ ts sum@@ m@@ er cam@@ p for f@@ our@@ - to si@@ x@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds .
"I was in char@@ ge of the f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds , which is good , because f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds can &apos;t play sp@@ or@@ ts , and ne@@ i@@ ther can I@@ ."
"I would tell them about how , on the wee@@ k@@ ends , I would go home and I would sp@@ y for the Q@@ u@@ een of En@@ g@@ land ."
"And so@@ on , other kids who wer@@ en &apos;t even in my group of kids , they would come up to me , and they would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re M@@ a@@ c B@@ ar@@ net@@ t , right ?"
You &apos;re the guy who sp@@ ies for the Q@@ u@@ een of En@@ g@@ land . &quot; &quot; And I had been wa@@ iting my whole life for str@@ ang@@ ers to come up and ask me that question .
"In my f@@ ant@@ as@@ y , they were s@@ v@@ el@@ te R@@ us@@ si@@ an women , but , you know , f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds — you take what you can get in B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
And I real@@ ized that the stories that I was t@@ elling were real in this way that was famili@@ ar to me and really exc@@ iting .
"I think the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of this for me — I &apos;ll never for@@ get this — there was this little girl nam@@ ed R@@ il@@ ey . She was tin@@ y , and she used to always take out her l@@ un@@ ch every day and she would th@@ row out her f@@ ru@@ it ."
"S@@ he would just take her f@@ ru@@ it , her mo@@ m p@@ ac@@ ked her a m@@ el@@ on every day , and she would just th@@ row it in the i@@ v@@ y and then she would e@@ at f@@ ru@@ it s@@ n@@ ac@@ ks and pu@@ d@@ ding cu@@ ps , and I was like , &quot; &quot; R@@ il@@ ey , you can &apos;t do that , you have to e@@ at the f@@ ru@@ it . &quot; &quot; And she was like , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , when you th@@ row the f@@ ru@@ it in the i@@ v@@ y , pretty so@@ on , it &apos;s going to be over@@ gro@@ wn with m@@ el@@ ons , &quot; &quot; which is why I think I en@@ ded up t@@ elling stories to children and not being a n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion@@ ist for children ."
"And so R@@ il@@ ey was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen ."
"That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot; &quot; And so , on the last day of cam@@ p , I got up early and I got a big can@@ tal@@ ou@@ p@@ e from the gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore and I hi@@ d it in the i@@ v@@ y , and then at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time , I was like , &quot; R@@ il@@ ey , why don &apos;t you go over there and see what you &apos;ve done . &quot;"
"And — ( Laughter ) — she went tru@@ d@@ g@@ ing through the i@@ v@@ y , and then her eyes just got so wi@@ de , and she poin@@ ted out this m@@ el@@ on that was bi@@ g@@ ger than her head , and then all the kids r@@ an over there and r@@ us@@ h@@ ed around her , and one of the kids was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why is there a s@@ tic@@ ker on this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; That is also why I say do not th@@ row your s@@ tic@@ kers in the i@@ v@@ y ."
"P@@ ut them in the tr@@ as@@ h can . It ru@@ ins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And R@@ il@@ ey car@@ ri@@ ed that m@@ el@@ on around with her all day , and she was so p@@ rou@@ d ."
"And R@@ il@@ ey knew she didn &apos;t gro@@ w a m@@ el@@ on in se@@ ven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a we@@ ird place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to ."
It &apos;s anything . Ar@@ t can get us to that place .
"S@@ he was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fic@@ tion ."
I &apos;m going to call it won@@ der .
"It &apos;s what C@@ ol@@ er@@ id@@ ge called the w@@ ill@@ ing s@@ us@@ p@@ en@@ sion of dis@@ beli@@ e@@ f or po@@ e@@ tic fa@@ ith , for those mom@@ ents where a story , no matter how str@@ an@@ ge , has some se@@ m@@ bl@@ ance of the tru@@ th , and then you &apos;re able to believe it ."
It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
"A@@ d@@ ul@@ ts can too , and we get there when we read ."
"It &apos;s why in two days , people will be des@@ cen@@ ding on D@@ u@@ bl@@ in to take the wal@@ king t@@ our of B@@ lo@@ om@@ s@@ day and see everything that happened in &quot; &quot; U@@ l@@ ys@@ ses , &quot; &quot; even though n@@ one of that happened ."
"O@@ r people go to L@@ on@@ don and they vi@@ s@@ it B@@ a@@ ker S@@ tre@@ et to see S@@ her@@ loc@@ k H@@ ol@@ m@@ es &apos; ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment , even though 2@@ 2@@ 1@@ B is just a number that was pa@@ in@@ ted on a building that never actually had that ad@@ dre@@ ss ."
"We know these char@@ ac@@ ters ar@@ en &apos;t real , but we have real fe@@ el@@ ings about them , and we &apos;re able to do that . We know these char@@ ac@@ ters ar@@ en &apos;t real ,"
and yet we also know that they are .
"@@ K@@ i@@ ds can get there a lot more eas@@ ily than ad@@ ul@@ ts can , and that &apos;s why I love wr@@ iting for kids ."
I think kids are the best au@@ dience for ser@@ i@@ ous liter@@ ary fic@@ tion .
"When I was a k@@ id , I was ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with sec@@ re@@ t do@@ or nov@@ els , things like &quot; &quot; N@@ ar@@ ni@@ a , &quot; &quot; where you would open a war@@ dro@@ be and go through to a mag@@ ical land ."
And I was con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that sec@@ re@@ t do@@ ors really did ex@@ ist and I would look for them and try to go through them .
"I wanted to live and cr@@ oss over into that fic@@ tional world , which is — I would always just open people &apos;s clos@@ et do@@ ors . ( Laughter ) I would just go through my mo@@ m &apos;s bo@@ y@@ friend &apos;s clos@@ et , and there was not a sec@@ re@@ t mag@@ ical land there ."
There was some other we@@ ird stuff that I think my mo@@ m should know about .
( Laughter ) And I was happy to tell her all about it .
"A@@ f@@ ter col@@ le@@ ge , my first job was working behind one of these sec@@ re@@ t do@@ ors ."
This is a place called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a .
"It &apos;s at 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a S@@ tre@@ et in the M@@ is@@ sion in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , and when I worked there , there was a publi@@ sh@@ ing company he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ed there called M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s , a non@@ prof@@ it wr@@ iting cen@@ ter called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a , but then the front of it was a str@@ an@@ ge sho@@ p ."
"You see , this place was z@@ on@@ ed re@@ ta@@ il , and in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , they were not going to give us a vari@@ ance , and so the writ@@ er who f@@ oun@@ ded it , a writ@@ er nam@@ ed D@@ ave E@@ gg@@ ers , to come into comp@@ li@@ ance with co@@ de , he said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine , I &apos;m just going to build a p@@ ir@@ ate sup@@ ply st@@ ore . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what he did . ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s all w@@ ood ."
There &apos;s dra@@ w@@ ers you can pul@@ l out and get c@@ it@@ r@@ us so you don &apos;t get sc@@ ur@@ v@@ y .
"They have e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ch@@ es in lots of col@@ ors , because when it &apos;s sp@@ r@@ ing@@ time , p@@ ir@@ ates want to go w@@ il@@ d ."
You don &apos;t know . B@@ l@@ ack is bor@@ ing . P@@ a@@ ste@@ l .
"O@@ r eyes , also in lots of col@@ ors , just gl@@ ass eyes , dep@@ en@@ ding on how you want to de@@ al with that sit@@ u@@ ation ."
"And the st@@ ore , str@@ an@@ ge@@ ly , people came to them and b@@ ou@@ ght things , and they en@@ ded up p@@ ay@@ ing the r@@ ent for our tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter , which was behind it , but to me , more important was the fact that I think the qu@@ ality of work you do , kids would come and get in@@ struc@@ tion in wr@@ iting , and when you have to walk this we@@ ird , li@@ min@@ al , fic@@ tional space like this to go do your wr@@ iting , it &apos;s going to aff@@ ect the kind of work that you make ."
It &apos;s a sec@@ re@@ t do@@ or that you can walk through .
"So I r@@ an the 8@@ 2@@ 6 in L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es , and it was my job to build the st@@ ore down there ."
So we have The E@@ ch@@ o P@@ ar@@ k T@@ i@@ me T@@ ra@@ v@@ el M@@ art .
"That &apos;s our m@@ ot@@ to : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en@@ ever you are , we &apos;re already then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s on S@@ un@@ set B@@ ou@@ lev@@ ard in L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es ."
O@@ ur fri@@ end@@ ly sta@@ ff is ready to help you .
"They &apos;re from all er@@ as , inclu@@ ding just the 19@@ 8@@ 0s , that guy on the end , he &apos;s from the very rec@@ ent past ."
"There &apos;s our E@@ m@@ p@@ lo@@ ye@@ es of the M@@ on@@ th , inclu@@ ding G@@ en@@ gh@@ is K@@ h@@ an , Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ick@@ ens ."
S@@ ome great people have come up through our ran@@ ks .
This is our kind of ph@@ ar@@ m@@ acy sec@@ tion .
"We have some pat@@ ent me@@ dic@@ ines , C@@ an@@ op@@ ic j@@ ar@@ s for your org@@ ans , commun@@ ist so@@ a@@ p that says , &quot; &quot; This is your so@@ a@@ p for the year . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) O@@ ur s@@ l@@ us@@ h@@ y machine bro@@ ke on the op@@ ening night and we didn &apos;t know what to do ."
O@@ ur arch@@ it@@ ect was co@@ vered in red sy@@ r@@ up .
"So we just put that sig@@ n on it that said , &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of order . C@@ ome back y@@ est@@ er@@ day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that en@@ ded up being a better jo@@ ke than s@@ l@@ us@@ hi@@ es , so we just left it there fore@@ ver ."
"M@@ am@@ m@@ ot@@ h Ch@@ un@@ ks . These things we@@ i@@ gh , like , se@@ ven p@@ ounds each ."
B@@ ar@@ b@@ ari@@ an re@@ p@@ ell@@ ent . It &apos;s full of s@@ al@@ ad and pot@@ p@@ our@@ r@@ i — things that bar@@ b@@ ari@@ ans h@@ ate .
D@@ e@@ ad langu@@ ages .
"( Laughter ) L@@ e@@ ech@@ es , nature &apos;s tin@@ y doc@@ tors ."
"And V@@ i@@ king O@@ d@@ or@@ ant , which comes in lots of great sc@@ ents : to@@ en@@ a@@ il@@ s , s@@ we@@ at and r@@ ot@@ ten ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les , p@@ y@@ re as@@ h ."
"Because we believe that A@@ x@@ e B@@ o@@ dy S@@ pr@@ ay is something that you should only find on the b@@ att@@ le@@ fiel@@ d , not under your ar@@ ms . ( Laughter ) And these are ro@@ bo@@ t emo@@ tion ch@@ i@@ ps , so ro@@ bot@@ s can feel love or fe@@ ar ."
"O@@ ur bi@@ gg@@ est sel@@ l@@ er is S@@ cha@@ d@@ en@@ fre@@ u@@ de , which we did not exp@@ ect ."
( Laughter ) We did not think that was going to happen .
"But there &apos;s a non@@ prof@@ it behind it , and kids go through a do@@ or that says &quot; &quot; E@@ m@@ p@@ lo@@ ye@@ es O@@ n@@ ly &quot; &quot; and they end up in this space where they do h@@ ome@@ work and wr@@ ite stories and make fil@@ ms and this is a book re@@ le@@ ase par@@ ty where kids will read ."
"There &apos;s a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly that &apos;s publi@@ shed with just wr@@ iting that &apos;s done by the kids who come every day after school , and we have re@@ le@@ ase par@@ ties and they e@@ at ca@@ ke and read for their parents and dr@@ ink mil@@ k out of cha@@ m@@ p@@ ag@@ ne gl@@ ass@@ es ."
"And it &apos;s a very speci@@ al space , because it &apos;s this we@@ ird space in the front ."
The jo@@ ke isn &apos;t a jo@@ ke .
"You can &apos;t find the se@@ am@@ s on the fic@@ tion , and I love that . It &apos;s this little bit of fic@@ tion that &apos;s col@@ on@@ ized the real world ."
I see it as kind of a book in three di@@ men@@ sions .
"There &apos;s a ter@@ m called me@@ ta@@ fic@@ tion , and that &apos;s just stories about stories , and me@@ t@@ a &apos;s having a moment now ."
"I@@ ts last big moment was probably in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s with no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts like J@@ o@@ h@@ n B@@ ar@@ th and W@@ illi@@ am G@@ ad@@ d@@ is , but it &apos;s been around ."
It &apos;s almost as old as stor@@ y@@ t@@ elling itself .
And one me@@ ta@@ fic@@ tive tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e is brea@@ king the f@@ our@@ th w@@ all . Right ?
"It &apos;s when an ac@@ tor will turn to the au@@ dience and say , &quot; &quot; I am an ac@@ tor , these are just ra@@ f@@ ters . &quot; &quot; And even that sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly h@@ on@@ est moment , I would ar@@ gu@@ e , is in serv@@ ice of the li@@ e , but it &apos;s sup@@ posed to fore@@ ground the arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ality of the fic@@ tion ."
"For me , I kind of pre@@ f@@ er the op@@ pos@@ ite ."
"If I &apos;m going to bre@@ ak down the f@@ our@@ th w@@ all , I want fic@@ tion to es@@ cap@@ e and come into the real world ."
I want a book to be a sec@@ re@@ t do@@ or that op@@ ens and le@@ ts the stories out into reality .
And so I try to do this in my bo@@ o@@ ks .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; B@@ il@@ ly T@@ w@@ it@@ ters and his B@@ l@@ ue Wh@@ ale P@@ ro@@ b@@ le@@ m . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s about a k@@ id who gets a bl@@ ue wh@@ ale as a pe@@ t but it &apos;s a p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment and it ru@@ ins his life .
So it &apos;s deli@@ vered o@@ vern@@ ight by F@@ ed@@ U@@ p .
( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
He lives in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o — very t@@ ough city to own a bl@@ ue wh@@ ale in .
"A lot of h@@ ill@@ s , real est@@ ate is at a pre@@ mi@@ um ."
"This market &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y , everybody ."
"But under@@ ne@@ ath the j@@ ac@@ ket is this case , and that &apos;s the co@@ ver under@@ ne@@ ath the book , the j@@ ac@@ ket , and there &apos;s an ad that off@@ ers a free 3@@ 0-@@ day ri@@ sk@@ -@@ free tri@@ al for a bl@@ ue wh@@ ale ."
And you can just s@@ end in a self-@@ ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed st@@ am@@ ped en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ e and we &apos;ll s@@ end you a wh@@ ale .
And kids do wr@@ ite in .
"So here &apos;s a le@@ tter . It says , &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ar people , I be@@ t you 10 b@@ uc@@ ks you won &apos;t s@@ end me a bl@@ ue wh@@ ale ."
"E@@ li@@ ot G@@ an@@ n@@ on ( age 6 ) . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So what E@@ li@@ ot and the other kids who s@@ end these in get back is a le@@ tter in very small pr@@ int from a N@@ or@@ we@@ gi@@ an la@@ w fir@@ m — ( Laughter ) — that says that du@@ e to a change in cu@@ st@@ om@@ s la@@ ws , their wh@@ ale has been hel@@ d up in S@@ o@@ g@@ ne@@ f@@ j@@ ord , which is a very lo@@ v@@ ely f@@ j@@ ord , and then it just kind of tal@@ ks about S@@ o@@ g@@ ne@@ f@@ j@@ ord and N@@ or@@ we@@ gi@@ an food for a little while . It di@@ gre@@ s@@ ses . ( Laughter )"
But it fin@@ i@@ sh@@ es off by saying that your wh@@ ale would love to hear from you .
"He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a mess@@ age ."
"And when you call and leave him a mess@@ age , you just , on the out@@ going mess@@ age , it &apos;s just wh@@ ale s@@ ounds and then a be@@ ep , which actually s@@ ounds a lot like a wh@@ ale sound ."
And they get a picture of their wh@@ ale too .
"So this is R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h , and R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h b@@ el@@ on@@ gs to a k@@ id nam@@ ed N@@ ic@@ o who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s mess@@ age ."
This is the first mess@@ age I ever got from N@@ ic@@ o .
"( Au@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ ell@@ o , this is N@@ ic@@ o ."
"I am your o@@ w@@ ner , R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h . H@@ ell@@ o ."
"So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you so@@ on another day . B@@ y@@ e ."
"M@@ a@@ c B@@ ar@@ net@@ t : So N@@ ic@@ o called back , like , an h@@ our later ."
( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s mess@@ ages .
"( Au@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ ell@@ o , R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h , this is N@@ ic@@ o ."
"I ha@@ ven &apos;t tal@@ ked to you for a long time , but I tal@@ ked to you on S@@ at@@ ur@@ day or S@@ und@@ ay , ye@@ a@@ h , S@@ at@@ ur@@ day or S@@ und@@ ay , so now I &apos;m call@@ ing you again to say h@@ ell@@ o and I won@@ der what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tom@@ or@@ row or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . B@@ y@@ e ."
"M@@ B : So he did , he called back that day again ."
He &apos;s left over 25 mess@@ ages for R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h over four years .
"You find out all about him and the gr@@ and@@ m@@ a that he lo@@ ves and the gr@@ and@@ m@@ a that he li@@ kes a little bit less — ( Laughter ) — and the cr@@ os@@ s@@ word pu@@ z@@ z@@ les that he does , and this is — I &apos;ll play you one more mess@@ age from N@@ ic@@ o ."
This is the Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as mess@@ age from N@@ ic@@ o .
"@@ &#91; B@@ e@@ ep &#93; ( Au@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ ell@@ o , R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h , sor@@ ry I ha@@ ven &apos;t tal@@ ked to you in a long time ."
"It &apos;s just that I &apos;ve been so bus@@ y because school started , as you might not know , probably , since you &apos;re a wh@@ ale , you don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m call@@ ing you to just say , to w@@ ish you a mer@@ ry Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as ."
"So have a n@@ ice Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , and b@@ ye@@ -@@ b@@ y@@ e , R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h . Goo@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
"M@@ B : I actually got N@@ ic@@ o , I ha@@ dn &apos;t heard from in 1@@ 8 months , and he just left a mess@@ age two days ago ."
"H@@ is vo@@ ice is completely different , but he put his bab@@ ys@@ it@@ ter on the phone , and she was very n@@ ice to R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h as well ."
But N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s the best read@@ er I could hope for .
I would want any@@ one I was wr@@ iting for to be in that place emo@@ tion@@ ally with the things that I create .
"I feel l@@ uc@@ k@@ y . K@@ i@@ ds like N@@ ic@@ o are the best read@@ ers , and they des@@ er@@ ve the best stories we can give them ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause ) Thank you . O@@ o@@ h , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; P@@ he@@ w , ph@@ ew , cal@@ m down .

"And there &apos;d be that sound in the sig@@ n@@ al — it &apos;s like ( S@@ cre@@ ech@@ ing ) — and he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an in@@ str@@ um@@ ent , because there are p@@ it@@ ch@@ es in it . &quot; &quot; And so some@@ how through develop@@ ing that , he ev@@ en@@ tually came to make the ther@@ em@@ in the way it is now ."
"And a lot of times , even kids no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , they &apos;ll make re@@ fer@@ ence to a ther@@ em@@ in by going , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ oo@@ -@@ h@@ oo@@ -@@ h@@ oo@@ -@@ ho@@ o , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 5@@ 0s it was used in the sci@@ -@@ f@@ i hor@@ ro@@ r movi@@ es , that sound that &apos;s like ... ( W@@ oo@@ -@@ h@@ oo@@ -@@ h@@ oo@@ -@@ ho@@ o ) ( Laughter ) It &apos;s kind of a fun@@ n@@ y , go@@ of@@ y sound to do ."
"And sometimes if I have too much co@@ ff@@ e@@ e , then my vi@@ bra@@ to gets out of hand ."
You &apos;re really sen@@ si@@ tive to your body and its fun@@ c@@ tions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
You have to st@@ ay so still if you want to have the most control .
"It re@@ min@@ ds me of the b@@ al@@ anc@@ ing act ear@@ li@@ er on — what M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el was doing — because you &apos;re fi@@ gh@@ ting so hard to keep the b@@ al@@ ance with what you &apos;re play@@ ing with and st@@ ay in tun@@ e , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to foc@@ us so much on being in tun@@ e all the time ; you want to be fe@@ eling the music ."
"And then also , you &apos;re trying to st@@ ay very , very , very still because little mov@@ em@@ ents with other par@@ ts of your body will aff@@ ect the p@@ it@@ ch , or sometimes if you &apos;re hol@@ ding a low n@@ ote — ( T@@ one ri@@ sing out of key ) — and brea@@ thing will make it ..@@ ."
( Laughter ) If I p@@ ass out on the next s@@ ong ... ( Laughter )
"I think of it almost like like a y@@ o@@ g@@ a in@@ str@@ um@@ ent because it makes you so aw@@ are of every little cra@@ z@@ y thing your body is doing , or just aw@@ are of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re play@@ ing ; you don &apos;t want to have any su@@ dd@@ en mov@@ em@@ ents ."
"And if I go to a clu@@ b and play a gi@@ g , people are like , &quot; Here , have some dr@@ in@@ ks on us ! &quot;"
"And it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m about to go on so@@ on ; I don &apos;t want to be like — ( T@@ e@@ e@@ ter@@ ing t@@ ones ) — you know ? &quot; &quot; It really does re@@ fl@@ ect the mo@@ od that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ..@@ ."
"@@ it &apos;s sim@@ il@@ ar to being a v@@ oc@@ al@@ ist , ex@@ cept instead of it coming out of your th@@ ro@@ at , you &apos;re contro@@ l@@ ling it just in the air and you don &apos;t really have a point of re@@ fer@@ ence ; you &apos;re always rel@@ ying on your ear@@ s and ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ing con@@ st@@ an@@ tly ."
"You just have to always ad@@ just to what &apos;s happening and real@@ ize you &apos;ll have b@@ um@@ m@@ er n@@ ot@@ es come here and there and list@@ en to it , ad@@ just it , and just move on , or else you &apos;ll get too ti@@ ed up and go cra@@ z@@ y . L@@ i@@ ke me ."
I think we will play another tun@@ e now .

"But we still live in a world where the col@@ or of our sk@@ in not only gi@@ ves a first im@@ pres@@ sion , but a la@@ st@@ ing one that re@@ ma@@ ins ."
I was bor@@ n in a family full of col@@ ors .
My father is the son of a ma@@ id from wh@@ om he in@@ her@@ ited an in@@ ten@@ se dar@@ k cho@@ col@@ ate t@@ one .
He was ad@@ op@@ ted by those who I know as my gr@@ and@@ parents .

She has two si@@ st@@ ers .

"( Laughter ) G@@ ro@@ wing up in this family , col@@ or was never important for me ."
"O@@ ut@@ side home , ho@@ we@@ ver , things were different so@@ on ."
C@@ ol@@ or had many other me@@ an@@ ings .
I remember my first dra@@ wing l@@ ess@@ ons in school as a b@@ un@@ ch of con@@ tra@@ dic@@ t@@ ory fe@@ el@@ ings .
It was exc@@ iting and cre@@ ative but I never underst@@ ood the uni@@ qu@@ e fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ co@@ lo@@ red p@@ en@@ ci@@ l .
I was made of fl@@ es@@ h but I wasn &apos;t p@@ ink .
"M@@ y sk@@ in was bro@@ wn , and people said I was black ."
I was se@@ ven years old with a m@@ ess of col@@ ors in my head .
"L@@ ater , when I took my c@@ ous@@ in to school , I was us@@ u@@ ally taken for the n@@ an@@ n@@ y ."
"B@@ y hel@@ ping in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en at a friend &apos;s par@@ ty , people thought I was the ma@@ id ."
I was even tre@@ ated like a pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ te just because I was wal@@ king al@@ one on the be@@ ach with Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an friends .
"And many times , vi@@ s@@ iting my gr@@ and@@ m@@ a or friends in up@@ per cl@@ ass buil@@ d@@ ings , I was inv@@ ited not to use the ma@@ in el@@ ev@@ ator ."
"Because in the end , with this col@@ or and this ha@@ ir , I can@@ not b@@ el@@ ong to some places ."
"In some way , I get to used to it and ac@@ cept part of it ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , something inside of me ke@@ e@@ ps re@@ vol@@ ving and str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling ."
Y@@ ear@@ s later I mar@@ ri@@ ed a S@@ p@@ an@@ i@@ ard .
But not any S@@ p@@ an@@ i@@ ard .
I ch@@ ose one with the sk@@ in col@@ or of a lob@@ ster when s@@ un@@ bur@@ n@@ t .
"( Laughter ) S@@ ince then , a new question started to cha@@ se me ."
What will be the col@@ or of your children ?
"As you can understand , this is my last con@@ cer@@ n ."
"But thinking about it , with my pre@@ vi@@ ous bac@@ k@@ ground , my story led me to make my person@@ al ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se as a photograp@@ her ."
And that is how H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e was bor@@ n .
"H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e is a pur@@ su@@ it to high@@ light our true col@@ ors , rather than the un@@ true wh@@ ite , red , black or y@@ el@@ low as@@ soci@@ ated with r@@ ace ."
It &apos;s a kind of g@@ ame to question our co@@ des .
It &apos;s a work in pro@@ gre@@ ss from a person@@ al story to a global history .
I por@@ tr@@ ay the sub@@ jects in a wh@@ ite bac@@ k@@ ground .
"Th@@ en I cho@@ ose an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ pi@@ x@@ el s@@ qu@@ are from the n@@ ose , pa@@ int the bac@@ k@@ ground , and look for the cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or in the indu@@ stri@@ al p@@ al@@ et@@ te , P@@ ant@@ one ."
"I started with my family and friends , then more and more people jo@@ ined the adv@@ ent@@ ure , th@@ an@@ ks to public call@@ s coming through the social me@@ dia ."
I thought that the ma@@ in space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open con@@ cept that inv@@ it@@ es everybody to p@@ us@@ h the share bu@@ t@@ ton in both the computer and their brain .
The s@@ no@@ w@@ b@@ all started to ro@@ ll .
"The project had a great w@@ el@@ come — inv@@ it@@ ations , ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions , phys@@ ical for@@ mat@@ s , g@@ all@@ er@@ ies and mus@@ e@@ um@@ s ..@@ ."
just happened .

"A@@ ll kinds of beli@@ e@@ f@@ s , gen@@ der id@@ enti@@ ties or phys@@ ical im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ments , a ne@@ w@@ bor@@ n or ter@@ min@@ ally ill ."
We all together build H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e .
Th@@ ose por@@ tra@@ its make us re@@ think how we see each other .
"When mo@@ der@@ n science is ques@@ tion@@ ing the r@@ ace con@@ cept , what does it mean for us to be black , wh@@ ite , y@@ el@@ low , red ?"
"I@@ s it the ey@@ e , the n@@ ose , the m@@ outh , the ha@@ ir ?"
"O@@ r does it have to do with our or@@ ig@@ in , na@@ tion@@ ality or b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t ?"
This person@@ al ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se turned out to be a disco@@ very .
S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I real@@ ized that H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e was us@@ e@@ ful for many people .
It re@@ pres@@ ents a sort of m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r for those who can@@ not find themselves re@@ fl@@ ected in any l@@ ab@@ el .
It was amazing that people started to share their thou@@ ghts about the work with me .
"I have hund@@ re@@ ds of that , I will share with you , too ."
"A mother of 11 years — A mother of an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old girl wr@@ ote me , &quot; &quot; V@@ ery good for me as a to@@ o@@ l to work on her con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence , as this past wee@@ k@@ end one of her gir@@ l@@ friends ar@@ gu@@ ed with her that she does not b@@ el@@ ong and should not be allo@@ wed to live in N@@ or@@ way ."

P@@ er@@ haps we should stop .

"@@ J@@ ust to show you some exam@@ ples , ill@@ u@@ str@@ at@@ ors and art students using it as a re@@ fer@@ ence for their s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch@@ es and their stu@@ dies ."

"That re@@ ma@@ ins a common pr@@ ac@@ tice wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de , and that will not dis@@ appe@@ ar by itself ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
I &apos;m very for@@ tun@@ ate to be here .
I feel so for@@ tun@@ ate .
I &apos;ve been so im@@ pres@@ sed by the kin@@ d@@ ness ex@@ pres@@ sed to me .
"I called my wi@@ fe L@@ es@@ li@@ e , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good ."
It fe@@ els like I &apos;ve lan@@ ded in a col@@ on@@ y of ang@@ els . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true fe@@ eling .
But let me get to the talk — I see the c@@ loc@@ k is run@@ ning .
"I &apos;m a public school te@@ ac@@ her , and I just want to share a story of my super@@ in@@ ten@@ dent ."
"H@@ er name is P@@ am M@@ or@@ an in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty , V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , the f@@ oo@@ th@@ ill@@ s of the B@@ l@@ ue R@@ id@@ ge M@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ."
And she &apos;s a very high@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h super@@ in@@ ten@@ dent .
"S@@ he uses s@@ mar@@ t bo@@ ar@@ ds , she b@@ lo@@ gs , she T@@ wee@@ ts , she does F@@ ace@@ book , she does all this sort of high@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h stuff ."
She &apos;s a technology lead@@ er and in@@ struc@@ tional lead@@ er .
"But in her off@@ ice , there &apos;s this old w@@ oo@@ d@@ en , we@@ a@@ ther@@ -@@ wor@@ n table , k@@ it@@ ch@@ en table — pe@@ eling gre@@ en pa@@ int , it &apos;s kind of r@@ ic@@ ke@@ ty ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ am , you &apos;re such a mo@@ der@@ n , c@@ ut@@ t@@ ing@@ -@@ ed@@ ge person ."
"Wh@@ y is this old table in your off@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I gre@@ w up in S@@ ou@@ th@@ we@@ st@@ er@@ n V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , in the co@@ al min@@ es and the far@@ m@@ l@@ ands of r@@ ural V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , and this table was in my gr@@ and@@ father &apos;s k@@ it@@ ch@@ en ."
"And we &apos;d come in from play@@ ing , he &apos;d come in from p@@ lo@@ wing and working , and we &apos;d s@@ it around that table every night ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , I heard so much know@@ le@@ dge and so many in@@ si@@ ghts and so much w@@ is@@ dom come out around this table , I beg@@ an to call it the w@@ is@@ dom table ."
"And when he p@@ ass@@ ed on , I took this table with me and b@@ rou@@ ght it to my off@@ ice , and it re@@ min@@ ds me of him ."
"It re@@ min@@ ds me of what goes on around an emp@@ ty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the W@@ or@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace G@@ ame , and ess@@ enti@@ ally it is also an emp@@ ty space ."
"And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 2@@ 1@@ st century w@@ is@@ dom table , really ."
It all started back in 19@@ 7@@ 7 .
"I was a young man , and I had been d@@ rop@@ ping in and out of col@@ le@@ ge ."
"And my parents were very pati@@ ent , but I had been doing inter@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ent so@@ jour@@ ns to India on a m@@ ys@@ tical qu@@ est ."
"And I remember the last time I came back from India — in my long wh@@ ite flo@@ wing ro@@ b@@ es and my big be@@ ard and my J@@ o@@ h@@ n L@@ en@@ n@@ on gl@@ ass@@ es — and I said to my father , &quot; D@@ ad , I think I &apos;ve just about found sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , d@@ ad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they p@@ lead@@ ed with me to get a de@@ gre@@ e in something ."
So I got a de@@ gre@@ e and it turned out to be education .
It was an experim@@ ental education progra@@ m .
"It could have been d@@ enti@@ stry , but the word &quot; &quot; experim@@ ental &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for ."
"And I went in for a job inter@@ view in the R@@ ic@@ h@@ mon@@ d P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c S@@ cho@@ ols in V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , the cap@@ ital city , b@@ ou@@ ght a thre@@ e-@@ piece su@@ it — my con@@ c@@ es@@ sion to con@@ ven@@ tion — ke@@ pt my long be@@ ard and my af@@ r@@ o and my pl@@ at@@ form sho@@ es — at the time it was the &apos; 7@@ 0s — and I wal@@ ked in , and I s@@ at down and had an inter@@ view ."
"And I gu@@ ess they were hard up for te@@ ach@@ ers because the super@@ vi@@ s@@ or , her name was An@@ n@@ a Ar@@ o , said I had the job te@@ ach@@ ing gi@@ f@@ ted children ."
"And I was so sho@@ c@@ ked , so st@@ un@@ ned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , th@@ ank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) G@@ i@@ f@@ ted education ha@@ dn &apos;t really taken h@@ old too much ."
There wer@@ en &apos;t really many materi@@ als or things to use .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer sho@@ c@@ ked me . It st@@ un@@ ned me ."
H@@ er answer set the tem@@ pl@@ ate for the entire care@@ er I was to have after that .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question c@@ lear@@ ed the space ."
"There was no progra@@ m direc@@ tive , no man@@ ual to fol@@ low , no st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds in gi@@ f@@ ted education in that way ."
"And she c@@ lear@@ ed such a space that I en@@ de@@ av@@ o@@ red from then on to cle@@ ar a space for my students , an emp@@ ty space , wh@@ er@@ e@@ by they could create and make me@@ an@@ ing out of their own underst@@ anding ."
"So this happened in 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and I was te@@ ach@@ ing many years later , and a friend of m@@ ine int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed me to a young fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker ."
H@@ is name is Ch@@ r@@ is F@@ ar@@ in@@ a .
Ch@@ r@@ is F@@ ar@@ in@@ a is here today at his own cost .
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is , could you st@@ and up and let them see you — a young , vi@@ sion@@ ary fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker who &apos;s made a fil@@ m ."
( Applause ) This fil@@ m is called &quot; &quot; W@@ or@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace and O@@ ther 4@@ th G@@ ra@@ de A@@ ch@@ i@@ ev@@ em@@ ents . &quot; &quot; He pro@@ posed the fil@@ m to me — it &apos;s a great ti@@ tle .
"He pro@@ posed the fil@@ m to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local T@@ V , and we can say h@@ i to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the fil@@ m has really g@@ one places ."
"Now it &apos;s still in de@@ b@@ t , but Ch@@ r@@ is has manag@@ ed , through his own s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice , to get this fil@@ m out ."
"So we made a fil@@ m and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one te@@ ac@@ her ."
It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a te@@ st@@ am@@ ent to te@@ ach@@ ing and te@@ ach@@ ers .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
"And the str@@ an@@ ge thing is , when I wat@@ ch the fil@@ m — I have the e@@ eri@@ e sen@@ sa@@ tion of seeing it — I saw myself liter@@ ally dis@@ appe@@ ar ."
What I saw was my te@@ ach@@ ers coming through me .
"I saw my ge@@ ome@@ try te@@ ac@@ her in high school , M@@ r@@ . R@@ uc@@ ell &apos;s wr@@ y sm@@ ile under his h@@ and@@ le@@ b@@ ar m@@ u@@ st@@ ac@@ he ."
That &apos;s the sm@@ ile I use — that &apos;s his sm@@ ile .
I saw J@@ an P@@ ol@@ o &apos;s fl@@ ash@@ ing eyes .
"And they wer@@ en &apos;t fl@@ ash@@ ing in an@@ ger , they were fl@@ ash@@ ing in love , in@@ ten@@ se love for her students ."
And I have that kind of fl@@ as@@ h sometimes .
And I saw M@@ is@@ s E@@ the@@ l J@@ . B@@ an@@ ks who wor@@ e pe@@ ar@@ ls and high@@ -@@ he@@ els to el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school every day .
"And you know , she had that ol@@ d@@ -@@ school te@@ ac@@ her st@@ are ."
You know the one .
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that te@@ ac@@ her ?"
"I didn &apos;t use that st@@ are very often , but I do have it in my re@@ per@@ to@@ ire ."
And M@@ is@@ s B@@ an@@ ks was there as a great m@@ ent@@ or for me .
"And then I saw my own parents , my first te@@ ach@@ ers ."
"M@@ y father , very inv@@ en@@ tive , sp@@ a@@ ti@@ al thin@@ ker ."
That &apos;s my bro@@ ther M@@ al@@ col@@ m there on the right .
"And my mother , who ta@@ u@@ ght me in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de in se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated s@@ cho@@ ols in V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , who was my in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion ."
"And really , I feel as though , when I see the fil@@ m — I have a ge@@ st@@ ure she does , like this — I feel like I am a contin@@ u@@ ation of her ge@@ st@@ ure ."
I am one of her te@@ ach@@ ing ge@@ stu@@ res .
"And the beautiful thing was , I got to te@@ ach my d@@ aughter in el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school , M@@ ad@@ el@@ ine ."
And so that ge@@ st@@ ure of my mother &apos;s contin@@ ues through many gener@@ ations .
It &apos;s an amazing fe@@ eling to have that l@@ ine@@ age .
And so I &apos;m here st@@ anding on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ ers of many people .
I &apos;m not here al@@ one .
There are many people on this st@@ age right now .
And so this W@@ or@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace G@@ ame I &apos;d like to tell you about .
"It started out like this : it &apos;s just a f@@ our@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t by fi@@ v@@ e-@@ f@@ oo@@ t pl@@ y@@ w@@ ood bo@@ ard in an in@@ ner@@ -@@ city ur@@ b@@ an school , 19@@ 7@@ 8 ."
I was cre@@ ating a l@@ ess@@ on for students on Africa .
"We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them sol@@ ve it ."
I didn &apos;t want to l@@ ec@@ ture or have just book read@@ ing .
I wanted to have them be im@@ mer@@ sed and learn the fe@@ eling of learning through their bo@@ dies .
"So I thought , well they like to play g@@ am@@ es ."
I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say inter@@ ac@@ tive ; we didn &apos;t have that ter@@ m in 19@@ 7@@ 8 — but something inter@@ ac@@ tive .
"And so we made the g@@ ame , and it has since evol@@ ved to a f@@ our@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t by f@@ our@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t by f@@ our@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t P@@ le@@ x@@ ig@@ l@@ ass structure ."
And it has four P@@ le@@ x@@ ig@@ l@@ ass l@@ ay@@ ers .
There &apos;s an ou@@ ter space l@@ ay@@ er with black hol@@ es and s@@ at@@ el@@ lit@@ es and research s@@ at@@ el@@ lit@@ es and ast@@ er@@ o@@ id min@@ ing .
"There &apos;s an air and space level with cl@@ ou@@ ds that are big pu@@ ff@@ s of c@@ ot@@ ton we p@@ us@@ h around and ter@@ r@@ it@@ ori@@ al air sp@@ ac@@ es and air for@@ ces , a ground and se@@ a level with thousands of g@@ ame piec@@ es on it — even an under@@ se@@ a level with sub@@ mar@@ ines and under@@ se@@ a min@@ ing ."
There are four countries around the bo@@ ard .
The kids make up the nam@@ es of the countries — some are r@@ ich ; some are po@@ or .
"They have different as@@ se@@ ts , comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al and mil@@ it@@ ary ."
And each country has a c@@ ab@@ in@@ et .
"There &apos;s a P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er , S@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of St@@ ate , M@@ in@@ ist@@ er of D@@ e@@ f@@ en@@ se and a C@@ F@@ O , or C@@ om@@ p@@ t@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ er ."
I cho@@ ose the P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er based on my relation@@ ship with them .
"I off@@ er them the job , they can turn it down , and then they cho@@ ose their own c@@ ab@@ in@@ et ."
"There &apos;s a W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank , ar@@ ms de@@ al@@ ers and a United N@@ ations ."
There &apos;s also a we@@ a@@ ther go@@ dd@@ ess who contro@@ ls a ran@@ dom st@@ oc@@ k market and ran@@ dom we@@ a@@ ther .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
And then there &apos;s a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ p@@ age cri@@ s@@ is doc@@ um@@ ent with 50 inter@@ loc@@ king problems .
"So that , if one thing chang@@ es , everything else chang@@ es ."
"I th@@ row them into this comple@@ x mat@@ ri@@ x , and they tr@@ ust me because we have a de@@ ep , r@@ ich relation@@ ship together ."
"And so with all these cri@@ ses , we have — let &apos;s see — e@@ th@@ n@@ ic and min@@ or@@ ity ten@@ sions ; we have chem@@ ical and n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar sp@@ ill@@ s , n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s oil sp@@ ill@@ s , environ@@ m@@ ental di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers , water ri@@ ghts di@@ sp@@ ut@@ es , brea@@ k@@ away re@@ pub@@ lic@@ s , fam@@ ine , end@@ ang@@ er@@ ed species and global war@@ ming ."
"If A@@ l G@@ ore is here , I &apos;m going to s@@ end my f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ d@@ ers from A@@ gn@@ or@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t and V@@ en@@ able s@@ cho@@ ols to you because they sol@@ ved global war@@ ming in a week ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it se@@ ver@@ al times too . ( Laughter )
"So I also have in the g@@ ame a s@@ ab@@ ot@@ e@@ ur — some child — it &apos;s basically a tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker — and I have my tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to sa@@ ve the world and their posi@@ tion in the g@@ ame ."
But they &apos;re also trying to under@@ m@@ ine everything in the g@@ ame .
"And they do it sec@@ re@@ tly through mis@@ information and am@@ bi@@ gu@@ i@@ ties and ir@@ re@@ lev@@ anci@@ es , trying to c@@ ause everyone to think more de@@ ep@@ ly ."
"The s@@ ab@@ ot@@ e@@ ur is there , and we also read from S@@ u@@ n T@@ z@@ u &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Ar@@ t of W@@ ar . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ d@@ ers understand it — n@@ ine years old — and they h@@ and@@ le that and use that to understand how to , not fol@@ low — at first they do — the pa@@ ths to power and de@@ struc@@ tion , the p@@ ath to war ."
"They learn to over@@ look sh@@ or@@ t-@@ si@@ gh@@ ted re@@ ac@@ tions and imp@@ ul@@ sive thinking , to think in a lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m , more con@@ sequ@@ ential way ."
"S@@ te@@ war@@ t B@@ r@@ and is here , and one of the ideas for this g@@ ame came from him with a C@@ o@@ E@@ vol@@ ution Q@@ u@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly ar@@ tic@@ le on a pe@@ ace for@@ ce ."
"And in the g@@ ame , sometimes students actually form a pe@@ ace for@@ ce ."
I &apos;m just a c@@ loc@@ k wat@@ ch@@ er .
I &apos;m just a cl@@ ari@@ fi@@ er . I &apos;m just a fac@@ il@@ it@@ ator .
The students run the g@@ ame .
I have no chan@@ ce to make any po@@ lic@@ y what@@ so@@ ever once they start play@@ ing .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
( V@@ ide@@ o ) B@@ o@@ y : The W@@ or@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace G@@ ame is ser@@ i@@ ous .
You &apos;re actually getting ta@@ u@@ ght something like how to take care of the world .
"S@@ e@@ e , M@@ r@@ . H@@ un@@ ter is doing that because he says his time has mess@@ ed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fi@@ x that problem ."
"@@ J@@ o@@ h@@ n H@@ un@@ ter : I off@@ er@@ ed them a — ( Applause ) A@@ c@@ tually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer ."
And I ad@@ m@@ it the tru@@ th to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
"And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to di@@ g up the answer ."
And so I ap@@ o@@ logi@@ ze to them as well .
"I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sor@@ ry , bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls , but the tru@@ th is we have left this world to you in such a sa@@ d and ter@@ ri@@ ble sh@@ ape , and we hope you can fi@@ x it for us , and maybe this g@@ ame will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a s@@ inc@@ ere ap@@ o@@ logy , and they take it very ser@@ i@@ ously ."
Now you may be wonder@@ ing what all this comple@@ x@@ ity looks like .
"Well when we have the g@@ ame start , here &apos;s what you see ."
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) J@@ H : A@@ ll right , we &apos;re going into ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations as of now . G@@ o ."
"( Ch@@ at@@ ter ) J@@ H : My question to you is , who &apos;s in char@@ ge of that cl@@ ass@@ room ?"
It &apos;s a ser@@ i@@ ous question : who is really in char@@ ge ?
I &apos;ve learned to ce@@ de control of the cl@@ ass@@ room over to the students over time .
There &apos;s a tr@@ ust and an underst@@ anding and a de@@ dic@@ ation to an ide@@ al that I sim@@ ply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning te@@ ac@@ her : control every conver@@ sa@@ tion and respon@@ se in the cl@@ ass@@ room .
"It &apos;s im@@ possible . Th@@ e@@ ir coll@@ ec@@ tive w@@ is@@ dom is much gre@@ ater than m@@ ine , and I ad@@ m@@ it it to them op@@ en@@ ly ."
So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some mag@@ ical things that have happened .
"In this g@@ ame we had a little girl , and she was the D@@ e@@ f@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ ist@@ er of the po@@ o@@ rest n@@ ation ."
And the D@@ e@@ f@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ ist@@ er — she had the t@@ ank cor@@ ps and A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce and so for@@ th .
"And she was next do@@ or to a very we@@ al@@ thy , o@@ il@@ -@@ r@@ ich ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ out pro@@ v@@ oc@@ ation , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly she att@@ ac@@ ked , against her P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er &apos;s ord@@ ers , the nex@@ t-@@ do@@ or ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or &apos;s oil fiel@@ ds ."
"S@@ he mar@@ ched into the oil fiel@@ d re@@ ser@@ ves , sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded it , without fir@@ ing a sho@@ t , and sec@@ u@@ red it and hel@@ d it ."
And that ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or was un@@ able to con@@ duc@@ t any mil@@ it@@ ary oper@@ ations because their fu@@ el sup@@ ply was loc@@ ked up .
"We were all up@@ set with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?"
"This is the W@@ or@@ ld P@@ e@@ ace G@@ ame . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at n@@ ine years old , she hel@@ d her piec@@ es and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; T@@ o her gir@@ l@@ friends she said that ."
That &apos;s a bre@@ ach there .
"And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cr@@ oss a n@@ ine year@@ -@@ old girl with t@@ an@@ ks ."
( Laughter ) They are the tou@@ gh@@ est op@@ p@@ on@@ ents .
And we were very up@@ set .
I thought I was fa@@ il@@ ing as a te@@ ac@@ her . Why would she do this ?
"But come to find out , a few g@@ ame days later — and there are turns where we take ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation from a team — actually there &apos;s a ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation per@@ i@@ od with all te@@ am@@ s , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation , around and around , so each turn around is one g@@ ame day ."
So a few g@@ ame days later it came to light that we found out this maj@@ or country was plan@@ ning a mil@@ it@@ ary off@@ en@@ sive to d@@ om@@ in@@ ate the entire world .
"H@@ ad they had their fu@@ el sup@@ p@@ li@@ es , they would have done it ."
She was able to see the v@@ ec@@ tors and tr@@ end l@@ ines and in@@ ten@@ tions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ical deci@@ sion to att@@ ack in a pe@@ ace g@@ ame .
"Now she used a small war to a@@ ver@@ t a lar@@ ger war , so we st@@ op@@ ped and had a very good ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ical di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion about whether that was right , con@@ di@@ tional good , or not right ."
"That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the sit@@ u@@ ations ."
I could not have desig@@ ned that in te@@ ach@@ ing it .
It came about sp@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously through their coll@@ ec@@ tive w@@ is@@ dom .
"( Applause ) A@@ no@@ ther example , a beautiful thing happened ."
We have a le@@ tter in the g@@ ame .
"If you &apos;re a mil@@ it@@ ary comm@@ an@@ der and you w@@ age t@@ ro@@ op@@ s — the little pl@@ as@@ tic to@@ ys on the bo@@ ard — and you l@@ ose them , I put in a le@@ tter ."
You have to wr@@ ite a le@@ tter to their parents — the fic@@ tional parents of your fic@@ tional t@@ ro@@ op@@ s — expl@@ ain@@ ing what happened and off@@ ering your con@@ dol@@ ences .
So you have a little bit more thought before you comm@@ it to com@@ b@@ at .
"And so we had this sit@@ u@@ ation come up — last sum@@ m@@ er actually , at A@@ gn@@ or@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t S@@ ch@@ ool in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty — and one of our mil@@ it@@ ary comm@@ and@@ ers got up to read that le@@ tter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; M@@ r@@ . H@@ un@@ ter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a par@@ ent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a par@@ ent vi@@ s@@ iting that day , just sit@@ ting in the back of the room ."
&quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mo@@ m to read the le@@ tter .
"It &apos;ll be more real@@ er if she re@@ ads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she ga@@ me@@ ly pic@@ ked up the le@@ tter ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ ure . &quot; &quot; She started read@@ ing . She read one s@@ ent@@ ence .
She read two s@@ ent@@ ences .
"B@@ y the third s@@ ent@@ ence , she was in t@@ ear@@ s ."
I was in t@@ ear@@ s .
"E@@ very@@ body underst@@ ood that when we l@@ ose somebody , the win@@ n@@ ers are not g@@ lo@@ ating ."
We all l@@ ose .
And it was an amazing oc@@ curr@@ ence and an amazing underst@@ anding .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend D@@ a@@ vi@@ d says about this .
He &apos;s been in many b@@ att@@ les .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ a@@ vi@@ d : We &apos;ve really had enough of people att@@ ac@@ king .
"I mean , we &apos;ve been l@@ uc@@ k@@ y &#91; most of &#93; the time ."
But now I &apos;m fe@@ eling really we@@ ird because I &apos;m living what S@@ u@@ n T@@ z@@ u said one week .
"One week he said , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose who go into b@@ at@@ tle and w@@ in will want to go back , and those who l@@ ose in b@@ at@@ tle will want to go back and w@@ in . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been win@@ ning b@@ att@@ les , so I &apos;m going into b@@ att@@ les , more b@@ att@@ les ."
And I think it &apos;s sort of we@@ ird to be living what S@@ u@@ n T@@ z@@ u said .
J@@ H : I get ch@@ ill@@ s every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of eng@@ ag@@ ement you want to have happen .
"And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t pl@@ an that , and I can &apos;t even test that ."
But it &apos;s self-@@ e@@ vi@@ dent ass@@ ess@@ ment .
We know that &apos;s an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c ass@@ ess@@ ment of learning .
"We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go be@@ y@@ on@@ d data with the real tru@@ th of what &apos;s going on ."
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend B@@ r@@ en@@ n@@ an .
"We had play@@ ed the g@@ ame one s@@ es@@ sion after school for many wee@@ ks , about se@@ ven wee@@ ks , and we had ess@@ enti@@ ally sol@@ ved all 50 of the inter@@ loc@@ king cri@@ ses ."
The way the g@@ ame is won is all 50 problems have to be sol@@ ved and every country &apos;s as@@ set val@@ ue has to be incre@@ as@@ ed ab@@ o@@ ve its star@@ ting point .
"S@@ ome are po@@ or , some are we@@ al@@ thy . There are b@@ illions ."
The W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank pre@@ si@@ dent was a th@@ ir@@ d@@ -@@ gra@@ der one time .
"He says , &quot; &quot; How many z@@ er@@ os in a tr@@ illion ? I &apos;ve got to cal@@ cul@@ ate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was se@@ tting f@@ is@@ c@@ al po@@ lic@@ y in that g@@ ame for high school play@@ ers who were play@@ ing with him ."
So the team that was the po@@ o@@ rest had g@@ ot@@ ten even po@@ o@@ re@@ r .
There was no way they could w@@ in .
"And we were appro@@ ach@@ ing four o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k , our c@@ ut@@ -@@ off time — there was about a minut@@ e left — and des@@ pa@@ ir just se@@ t@@ t@@ led over the room ."
"I thought , I &apos;m fa@@ il@@ ing as a te@@ ac@@ her ."
I should have g@@ ot@@ ten it so they could have won .
They sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be fa@@ il@@ ing like this .
I &apos;ve fa@@ il@@ ed them .
And I was just fe@@ eling so sa@@ d and de@@ jec@@ ted .
"And su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , B@@ r@@ en@@ n@@ an wal@@ ked over to my cha@@ ir and he gr@@ ab@@ bed the b@@ ell , the b@@ ell I r@@ ing to sig@@ n@@ al a change or a re@@ con@@ ven@@ ing of c@@ ab@@ ine@@ ts , and he r@@ an back to his se@@ at , ran@@ g the b@@ ell ."
"E@@ very@@ body r@@ an to his cha@@ ir : there was scre@@ am@@ ing ; there was y@@ elling , wa@@ ving of their d@@ os@@ si@@ ers ."
They get these d@@ os@@ si@@ ers full of sec@@ re@@ t doc@@ um@@ ents .
They were g@@ es@@ tic@@ ul@@ ating ; they were run@@ ning around .
I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d l@@ ost control of my cl@@ ass@@ room .
"P@@ r@@ in@@ ci@@ p@@ al wal@@ ks in , I &apos;m out of a job ."
The parents were looking in the win@@ d@@ ow .
And B@@ r@@ en@@ n@@ an run@@ s back to his se@@ at . E@@ very@@ body run@@ s back to their se@@ at .
"He r@@ ings the b@@ ell again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 secon@@ ds left on the c@@ loc@@ k — &quot; &quot; we have , all n@@ ations , po@@ ol@@ ed all our fun@@ ds together ."
And we &apos;ve got 6@@ 00 billion dollars .
We &apos;re going to off@@ er it as a d@@ on@@ ation to this po@@ or country .
"And if they ac@@ cept it , it &apos;ll ra@@ ise their as@@ set val@@ ue and we can w@@ in the g@@ ame ."
W@@ ill you ac@@ cept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three secon@@ ds left on the c@@ loc@@ k .
"E@@ very@@ body looks at this pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; And the g@@ ame is won ."
"S@@ p@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous comp@@ as@@ sion that could not be plan@@ ned for , that was un@@ exp@@ ected and un@@ predic@@ table ."
E@@ very g@@ ame we play is different .
"S@@ ome g@@ am@@ es are more about social issu@@ es , some are more about economic issu@@ es ."
S@@ ome g@@ am@@ es are more about war@@ f@@ are .
But I don &apos;t try to d@@ en@@ y them that reality of being human .
"I al@@ low them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a bloo@@ d@@ less way , how not to do what they consi@@ der to be the wrong thing ."
"And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves ."
"And so in this g@@ ame , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pic@@ k up a cri@@ tical thinking to@@ o@@ l or cre@@ ative thinking to@@ o@@ l from this g@@ ame and le@@ ver@@ age something good for the world , they may sa@@ ve us all ."
If only .
"And on be@@ half of all of my te@@ ach@@ ers on wh@@ ose sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ ers I &apos;m st@@ anding , th@@ ank you . Thank you . Thank you ."
( Applause )
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small to@@ wn k@@ id .
"I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story ."
He lives in a small v@@ ill@@ age in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ om@@ al@@ ia .
H@@ is v@@ ill@@ age is ne@@ ar M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
D@@ rou@@ ght dri@@ ves the small v@@ ill@@ age into po@@ ver@@ ty and to the br@@ ink of star@@ v@@ ation .
"W@@ ith nothing left for him there , he le@@ a@@ ves for the big city , in this case , M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , the cap@@ ital of S@@ om@@ al@@ ia ."
"When he ar@@ ri@@ ves , there are no opport@@ uni@@ ties , no j@@ ob@@ s , no way for@@ ward ."
He ends up living in a t@@ ent city on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
"M@@ ay@@ be a year p@@ ass@@ es , nothing ."
"One day , he &apos;s appro@@ ach@@ ed by a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man who off@@ ers to take him to l@@ un@@ ch , then to d@@ in@@ ner , to brea@@ k@@ f@@ ast ."
"He me@@ ets this d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic group of people , and they give him a bre@@ ak ."
"He &apos;s given a bit of money to bu@@ y h@@ im@@ self some new c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , money to s@@ end back home to his family ."
He is int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed to this young woman .
He ev@@ en@@ tually gets mar@@ ri@@ ed .
He star@@ ts this new life .
He has a pur@@ p@@ ose in life .
"One beautiful day in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , under an a@@ z@@ ure bl@@ ue sk@@ y , a car b@@ om@@ b goes off ."
"That small to@@ wn k@@ id with the big city dre@@ am@@ s was the su@@ ici@@ de b@@ om@@ ber , and that d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic group of people were al S@@ ha@@ b@@ a@@ a@@ b , a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist organ@@ ization l@@ in@@ ked to al Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a ."
So how does the story of a small to@@ wn k@@ id just trying to make it big in the city end up with him b@@ lo@@ wing h@@ im@@ self up ?
He was wa@@ iting .
"He was wa@@ iting for an opport@@ un@@ ity , wa@@ iting to beg@@ in his future , wa@@ iting for a way for@@ ward , and this was the first thing that came along ."
This was the first thing that pul@@ led him out of what we call wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood .
And his story re@@ pe@@ ats itself in ur@@ b@@ an cen@@ ters around the world .
"It is the story of the dis@@ en@@ fr@@ an@@ ch@@ is@@ ed , un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed ur@@ b@@ an y@@ outh who sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ ots in J@@ o@@ h@@ an@@ n@@ es@@ bur@@ g , sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ ots in L@@ on@@ don , who re@@ ach@@ es out for something other than wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood ."
"For young people , the pr@@ om@@ ise of the city , the big city dre@@ am is that of opport@@ un@@ ity , of j@@ ob@@ s , of we@@ al@@ th , but young people are not shar@@ ing in the pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity of their cities ."
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s y@@ outh who su@@ ff@@ er from the high@@ est un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment r@@ ates .
"B@@ y 20@@ 30 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 1@@ 8 ."
"If we do not inclu@@ de young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provi@@ de them opport@@ uni@@ ties , the story of wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood , the g@@ ate@@ way to ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , to viol@@ ence , to g@@ an@@ gs , will be the story of cities 2@@ .@@ 0 ."
"And in my city of b@@ ir@@ th , M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , 7@@ 0 percent of young people su@@ ff@@ er from un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ."
"@@ 7@@ 0 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school ."
They pretty much do nothing .
"I went back to M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u last mon@@ th , and I went to vi@@ s@@ it M@@ ad@@ in@@ a H@@ osp@@ ital , the h@@ osp@@ ital I was bor@@ n in ."
"I remember st@@ anding in front of that b@@ ul@@ le@@ t-@@ ri@@ dd@@ en h@@ osp@@ ital thinking , what if I had never left ?"
What if I had been for@@ c@@ ed into that same state of wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood ?
W@@ ould I have become a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
My reason for being in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u that mon@@ th was actually to h@@ ost a y@@ outh lead@@ er@@ ship and ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship sum@@ m@@ it .
I b@@ rou@@ ght together about 9@@ 0 young S@@ om@@ al@@ i lead@@ ers .
We s@@ at down and bra@@ in@@ stor@@ m@@ ed on solu@@ tions to the bi@@ gg@@ est chall@@ eng@@ es fac@@ ing their city .
One of the young men in the room was A@@ d@@ en .
"He went to uni@@ versity in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , gra@@ du@@ ated ."
"There were no j@@ ob@@ s , no opport@@ uni@@ ties ."
"I remember him t@@ elling me , because he was a col@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ate , un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed , f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated , that he was the per@@ f@@ ect t@@ ar@@ get for al S@@ ha@@ b@@ a@@ a@@ b and other ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist organ@@ iz@@ ations , to be rec@@ ru@@ ited ."
They s@@ ou@@ ght people like him out .
But his story takes a different rou@@ te .
"In M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , the bi@@ gg@@ est bar@@ ri@@ er to getting from point A to point B are the ro@@ ads ."
"T@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ three years of civi@@ l war have completely de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed the ro@@ ad system , and a m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke can be the eas@@ i@@ est way to get around ."
A@@ d@@ en saw an opport@@ un@@ ity and se@@ ized it .
He started a m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke company .
He beg@@ an r@@ en@@ ting out m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ kes to local resi@@ d@@ ents who couldn &apos;t norm@@ ally aff@@ ord them .
"He b@@ ou@@ ght 10 bi@@ kes , with the help of family and friends , and his dre@@ am is to ev@@ en@@ tually exp@@ and to se@@ ver@@ al hund@@ red within the next three years ."
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to id@@ enti@@ f@@ y and se@@ ize a new opport@@ un@@ ity .
"It &apos;s ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship , and I believe ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship can be the most powerful to@@ o@@ l against wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood ."
It em@@ po@@ w@@ ers young people to be the cre@@ at@@ ors of the very economic opport@@ uni@@ ties they are so des@@ per@@ ately see@@ king .
And you can tra@@ in young people to be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s .
"I want to talk to you about a young man who at@@ ten@@ ded one of my me@@ et@@ ings , M@@ o@@ ha@@ m@@ ed M@@ o@@ ha@@ m@@ ou@@ d , a fl@@ or@@ ist ."
He was hel@@ ping me tra@@ in some of the young people at the sum@@ m@@ it in ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship and how to be innov@@ ative and how to create a culture of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship .
"He &apos;s actually the first fl@@ or@@ ist M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u has seen in over 2@@ 2 years , and until rec@@ ently , until M@@ o@@ ha@@ m@@ ed came along , if you wanted flo@@ w@@ ers at your we@@ d@@ ding , you used pl@@ as@@ tic b@@ ou@@ qu@@ ets shi@@ p@@ ped from ab@@ ro@@ ad ."
"If you asked someone , &quot; Wh@@ en was the last time you saw f@@ res@@ h flo@@ w@@ ers ? &quot;"
"@@ for many who gre@@ w up under civi@@ l war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever . &quot; &quot; So M@@ o@@ ha@@ m@@ ed saw an opport@@ un@@ ity ."
He started a l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ ing and design fl@@ or@@ al company .
"He created a far@@ m right outside of M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , and started gro@@ wing tu@@ li@@ ps and li@@ li@@ es , which he said could survi@@ ve the har@@ sh M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u clim@@ ate ."
"And he beg@@ an deli@@ ver@@ ing flo@@ w@@ ers to we@@ dd@@ ings , cre@@ ating g@@ ar@@ d@@ ens at h@@ omes and bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es around the city , and he &apos;s now working on cre@@ ating M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u &apos;s first public par@@ k in 2@@ 2 years ."
There &apos;s no public par@@ k in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
"He wan@@ ts to create a space where famili@@ es , young people , can come together , and , as he says , sm@@ ell the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al r@@ os@@ es ."
"And he doesn &apos;t gro@@ w r@@ os@@ es because they use too much water , by the way ."
"So the first ste@@ p is to in@@ sp@@ ire young people , and in that room , M@@ o@@ ha@@ m@@ ed &apos;s pres@@ ence had a really pro@@ found imp@@ act on the y@@ outh in that room ."
They had never really thought about star@@ ting up a business .
"They &apos;ve thought about working for an N@@ G@@ O , working for the government , but his story , his innov@@ ation , really had a str@@ ong imp@@ act on them ."
He for@@ c@@ ed them to look at their city as a place of opport@@ un@@ ity .
"He em@@ power@@ ed them to believe that they could be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s , that they could be change ma@@ kers ."
"B@@ y the end of the day , they were coming up with innov@@ ative solu@@ tions to some of the bi@@ gg@@ est chall@@ eng@@ es fac@@ ing their city ."
They came up with ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ i@@ al solu@@ tions to local problems .
"So in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing young people and cre@@ ating a culture of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship is a really great ste@@ p , but young people need cap@@ ital to make their ideas a reality ."
They need exper@@ ti@@ se and m@@ ent@@ or@@ ship to gu@@ i@@ de them in develop@@ ing and la@@ un@@ ching their bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es .
"C@@ on@@ n@@ ect young people with the res@@ our@@ ces they need , provi@@ de them the sup@@ port they need to go from ide@@ ation to cre@@ ation , and you will create c@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ sts for ur@@ b@@ an growth ."
"For me , ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship is more than just star@@ ting up a business ."
It &apos;s about cre@@ ating a social imp@@ act .
M@@ o@@ ha@@ m@@ ed is not sim@@ ply sel@@ ling flo@@ w@@ ers .
I believe he is sel@@ ling hope .
"H@@ is P@@ e@@ ace P@@ ar@@ k , and that &apos;s what he call@@ s it , when it &apos;s created , will actually trans@@ form the way people see their city ."
A@@ d@@ en hi@@ red stre@@ et kids to help r@@ ent out and ma@@ in@@ tain those bi@@ kes for him .
He gave them the opport@@ un@@ ity to es@@ cap@@ e the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is of wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood .

Thank you .

"O@@ kay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play ."
I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
I didn &apos;t real@@ ize there was going to be a little music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
"( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause ) O@@ kay , so first of all , let &apos;s w@@ el@@ come M@@ r@@ . J@@ am@@ ire W@@ illi@@ am@@ s on the dr@@ um@@ s , ( Applause ) B@@ ur@@ n@@ is@@ s T@@ ra@@ v@@ is on the bas@@ s , ( Applause ) and M@@ r@@ . Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an S@@ ands on the pi@@ an@@ o . ( Applause )"
"So the b@@ and@@ st@@ and , as we call it , this is an incredi@@ ble space ."
It is really a s@@ ac@@ red space .
"And one of the things that is really s@@ ac@@ red about it is that you have no opport@@ un@@ ity to think about the future , or the past ."
You really are ali@@ ve right here in this moment .
There are so many deci@@ sions being made when you walk on the b@@ and@@ st@@ and .
We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
"In the middle , we sort of made our way into a s@@ ong called &quot; &quot; T@@ it@@ i B@@ oo@@ m . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not ."
E@@ very@@ one &apos;s list@@ ening . We &apos;re respon@@ ding .
You have no time for pro@@ jec@@ ted ideas .
"So the idea of a m@@ ist@@ ake : F@@ rom the per@@ spec@@ tive of a j@@ a@@ z@@ z mus@@ ici@@ an , it &apos;s eas@@ i@@ er to talk about someone else &apos;s m@@ ist@@ ake ."
"So the way I per@@ ce@@ ive a m@@ ist@@ ake when I &apos;m on the b@@ and@@ st@@ and — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a m@@ ist@@ ake ."
The only m@@ ist@@ ake li@@ es in that I &apos;m not able to per@@ ce@@ ive what it is that someone else did .
E@@ very &quot; &quot; m@@ ist@@ ake &quot; &quot; is an opport@@ un@@ ity in j@@ a@@ z@@ z .
So it &apos;s hard to even des@@ cri@@ be what a fun@@ n@@ y n@@ ote would be .
"So for example , if I play@@ ed a col@@ or , like we were play@@ ing on a p@@ al@@ et@@ te , that s@@ oun@@ ded like this ..@@ ."
( Mus@@ ic ) So if Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an play@@ ed a n@@ ote — like play an F@@ . ( Mus@@ ic )
"S@@ e@@ e , these are all right inside of the col@@ or p@@ al@@ et@@ te ."
If you play@@ ed an E@@ .
"S@@ e@@ e , these all li@@ e right inside of this gener@@ al emo@@ tional p@@ al@@ et@@ te that we were pa@@ in@@ ting ."
"If you play@@ ed an F # though , ( D@@ is@@ son@@ ance ) to most people &apos;s ear@@ s , they would per@@ ce@@ ive that as a m@@ ist@@ ake ."
"So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second ."
And we &apos;re going to play on this p@@ al@@ et@@ te .
"And at some point , Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an will int@@ ro@@ duce this n@@ ote ."
And we won &apos;t re@@ act to it .
"He &apos;ll int@@ ro@@ duce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second ."
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this p@@ al@@ et@@ te .
( Mus@@ ic ) So someone could con@@ cep@@ tually per@@ ce@@ ive that as a m@@ ist@@ ake .
The only way that I would say it was a m@@ ist@@ ake is in that we didn &apos;t re@@ act to it .
It was an opport@@ un@@ ity that was mis@@ sed .
So it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table . We &apos;ll pa@@ int this p@@ al@@ et@@ te again .
"He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll re@@ act to it , but something will change ."
"We &apos;ll all ac@@ cept his ideas , or not ."
"( Mus@@ ic ) So you see , he play@@ ed this n@@ ote ."
I en@@ ded up cre@@ ating a m@@ el@@ o@@ dy out of it .
The t@@ ex@@ ture changed in the dr@@ um@@ s this time .
"It got a little bit more r@@ hy@@ th@@ m@@ ic , a little bit more in@@ ten@@ se in respon@@ se to how I respon@@ ded to it ."
So there is no m@@ ist@@ ake .
"The only m@@ ist@@ ake is if I &apos;m not aw@@ are , if each individu@@ al mus@@ ici@@ an is not aw@@ are and ac@@ cep@@ ting enough of his fel@@ low b@@ and member to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate the idea and we don &apos;t al@@ low for cre@@ a@@ tivity ."
"So j@@ a@@ z@@ z , this b@@ and@@ st@@ and is ab@@ solu@@ tely amazing ."
It &apos;s a very pur@@ i@@ f@@ ying experience .
And I know that I spe@@ ak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for gr@@ an@@ ted .
We know that to be able to come on the b@@ and@@ st@@ and and play music is a bl@@ ess@@ ing .
So how does this all rel@@ ate to behavi@@ or@@ al fin@@ ance ?
"Well we &apos;re j@@ a@@ z@@ z mus@@ ici@@ ans , so st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pic@@ ally we don &apos;t have a great relation@@ ship to fin@@ ance ."
"( Laughter ) An@@ y@@ way , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we h@@ and@@ le it ."
And the other d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic of it is that we don &apos;t mic@@ r@@ om@@ an@@ age in j@@ a@@ z@@ z .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually lim@@ its the arti@@ sti@@ c possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties .
"If I come up and I dic@@ t@@ ate to the b@@ and that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just j@@ um@@ p right in ..@@ ."
"@@ ready , just play some time ."
"One , two , one , two , three , four ."
( Mus@@ ic ) It &apos;s kind of cha@@ o@@ tic because I &apos;m b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying my ideas .
"I &apos;m t@@ elling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to list@@ en ."
This is a science of list@@ ening .
It has far more to do with what I can per@@ ce@@ ive than what it is that I can do .
"So if I want the music to get to a cer@@ tain level of in@@ ten@@ s@@ ity , the first ste@@ p for me is to be pati@@ ent , to list@@ en to what &apos;s going on and pul@@ l from something that &apos;s going on around me ."
"When you do that , you eng@@ age and in@@ sp@@ ire the other mus@@ ici@@ ans and they give you more , and gra@@ du@@ ally it buil@@ ds ."
"W@@ at@@ ch . One , two , a one , two , three , four ."
( Mus@@ ic ) T@@ ot@@ ally different experience when I &apos;m pul@@ ling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organ@@ ic . It &apos;s much more n@@ u@@ anc@@ ed .
It &apos;s not about b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying my vi@@ sion or anything like that .
"It &apos;s about being here in the moment , ac@@ cep@@ ting one another and allo@@ wing cre@@ a@@ tivity to f@@ low ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real chall@@ eng@@ es is to innov@@ ate fund@@ am@@ ent@@ ally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ th@@ r@@ all@@ ed to in education ."
This one te@@ ac@@ her didn &apos;t take it ser@@ i@@ ously .
"I want to say that really and tru@@ ly , after these incredi@@ ble spe@@ ech@@ es and ideas that are being sp@@ read , I am in the aw@@ k@@ ward posi@@ tion of being here to talk to you today about t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion ."
So most everyone wat@@ ch@@ es T@@ V .
We like it . We like some par@@ ts of it .
"H@@ ere in America , people actually love T@@ V ."
The a@@ ver@@ age American wat@@ ch@@ es T@@ V for almost 5 hours a day .
O@@ kay ?
"Now I happen to make my living these days in t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing ."
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
"They , in fact , ber@@ ate it ."
"They call it stu@@ p@@ id , and wor@@ se , believe me ."
"M@@ y mother , gro@@ wing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; i@@ di@@ ot bo@@ x . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to de@@ b@@ ate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good T@@ V or bad T@@ V ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion has a con@@ science ."
"So why I believe that t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion has a con@@ science is that I actually believe that t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion direc@@ tly re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ts the mor@@ al , poli@@ tical , social and emo@@ tional need st@@ ates of our n@@ ation — that t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion is how we actually dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate our entire val@@ ue system ."
"So all these things are uni@@ qu@@ ely human , and they all ad@@ d up to our idea of con@@ science ."
"Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad T@@ V ."
We &apos;re talking about pop@@ ular T@@ V .
We &apos;re talking about t@@ op@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated sho@@ ws over the course of 50 years .
"@@ How do these N@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ en r@@ at@@ ings re@@ fl@@ ect not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , coll@@ ec@@ tive un@@ con@@ sci@@ ous , but how do these t@@ op@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated sho@@ ws over 50 years re@@ fl@@ ect the idea of our social con@@ science ?"
"@@ How does t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion evol@@ ve over time , and what does this say about our society ?"
"Now spe@@ a@@ king of evol@@ ution , from bas@@ ic bio@@ logy , you probably remember that the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom , inclu@@ ding hum@@ ans , have four bas@@ ic pri@@ m@@ al inst@@ inc@@ ts ."
You have h@@ un@@ ger ; you have se@@ x ; you have power ; and you have the ur@@ ge for ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tiv@@ en@@ ess .
"As hum@@ ans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve develop@@ ed , we &apos;ve evol@@ ved over time to tem@@ per , or ta@@ me , these bas@@ ic anim@@ al inst@@ inc@@ ts ."
We have the cap@@ ac@@ ity to l@@ au@@ gh and cr@@ y .
"We feel a@@ we , we feel p@@ ity ."
That is se@@ par@@ ate and ap@@ art from the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom .
The other thing about human be@@ ings is that we love to be en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ined .
We love to wat@@ ch T@@ V .
This is something that c@@ lear@@ ly se@@ par@@ ates us from the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom .
"A@@ n@@ im@@ als might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to wat@@ ch ."
So I had an am@@ bi@@ tion to disco@@ ver what could be underst@@ ood from this uni@@ qu@@ ely human relation@@ ship between t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion progra@@ ms and the human con@@ sci@@ ous .
Why has t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment evol@@ ved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this car@@ to@@ on de@@ vi@@ l or an@@ ge@@ l sit@@ ting on our sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ ers .
"I@@ s t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion liter@@ ally fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing as our con@@ science , t@@ emp@@ ting us and re@@ war@@ ding us at the same time ?"
"So to beg@@ in to answer these questions , we did a research study ."
We went back 50 years to the 19@@ 5@@ 9 / 19@@ 60 t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion se@@ as@@ on .
We sur@@ v@@ ey@@ ed the t@@ op@@ -@@ 20 N@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ en sho@@ ws every year for 50 years — a thous@@ and sho@@ ws .
"We tal@@ ked to over 3@@ ,000 individu@@ als — almost 3@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 — ag@@ ed 1@@ 8 to 7@@ 0 , and we asked them how they felt emo@@ tion@@ ally ."
How did you feel wat@@ ching every single one of these sho@@ ws ?
D@@ id you feel a sense of mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity ?
D@@ id you feel ou@@ tra@@ ge ? D@@ id you l@@ au@@ gh ?
What did this mean for you ?
"So to our global TED au@@ di@@ ences , I want to say that this was a U.@@ S. sa@@ m@@ ple ."
"But as you can see , these emo@@ tional need st@@ ates are tru@@ ly uni@@ vers@@ al ."
"And on a fac@@ tual bas@@ is , over 80 percent of the U.@@ S. &apos; s most pop@@ ular sho@@ ws are ex@@ por@@ ted around the world ."
So I really hope our global au@@ di@@ ences can rel@@ ate .
"T@@ w@@ o ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ments before our first data sli@@ de : F@@ or in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing me to even think about the idea of con@@ science and the tr@@ ic@@ ks that con@@ science can play on us on a d@@ a@@ ily bas@@ is , I th@@ ank le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary r@@ ab@@ b@@ i , J@@ ack S@@ ter@@ n ."
"And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to th@@ ank TED community super@@ st@@ ar H@@ ans R@@ os@@ ling , who you may have just seen ."
"O@@ kay , here we go ."
"So here you see , from 19@@ 60 to 20@@ 10 , the 50 years of our study ."
"T@@ w@@ o things we &apos;re going to start with — the in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion state and the mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity state , which , for this pur@@ p@@ ose , we de@@ fin@@ ed in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion as t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion sho@@ ws that up@@ li@@ ft me , that make me feel much more posi@@ tive about the world ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity are t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sions sho@@ ws in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
"As we start , you see in 19@@ 60 in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion is hol@@ ding ste@@ ad@@ y ."
That &apos;s what we &apos;re wat@@ ching T@@ V for .
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity star@@ ts to clim@@ b .
"@@ Right at the end of the 6@@ 0s , mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity is going up , in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion is kind of on the wan@@ e ."
Why ?
"The C@@ u@@ b@@ an M@@ is@@ si@@ le C@@ ris@@ is , J@@ F@@ K is sho@@ t , the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ i@@ ghts movement , r@@ ace ri@@ ots , the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar , M@@ L@@ K is sho@@ t , B@@ ob@@ by K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy is sho@@ t , W@@ at@@ er@@ g@@ ate ."
L@@ ook what happens .
"In 19@@ 7@@ 0 , in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion pl@@ um@@ me@@ ts ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity takes off .
"They cr@@ oss , but R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an , a t@@ ele@@ gen@@ ic pre@@ si@@ dent , is in off@@ ice ."

"But look , it can &apos;t : A@@ I@@ D@@ S , I@@ ran@@ -@@ Con@@ tr@@ a , the Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ger di@@ sa@@ ster , Ch@@ er@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity bec@@ omes the d@@ om@@ in@@ ant me@@ me in t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion from 199@@ 0 for the next 20 years .
T@@ ake a look at this .
This ch@@ art is going to doc@@ um@@ ent a very sim@@ il@@ ar tr@@ end .
"But in this case , we have com@@ for@@ t — the bu@@ b@@ ble in red — social comm@@ ent@@ ary and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence in bl@@ ue and gre@@ en ."
"Now this time on T@@ V you have &quot; &quot; B@@ on@@ an@@ z@@ a , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t for@@ get , you have &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith , &quot; &quot; you have d@@ om@@ es@@ tic sho@@ ws all about com@@ for@@ t ."
This is ri@@ sing . C@@ om@@ for@@ t st@@ ays whole .
I@@ r@@ re@@ ver@@ ence star@@ ts to ri@@ se .
S@@ o@@ ci@@ al comm@@ ent@@ ary is all of a su@@ dd@@ en spi@@ king up .
"You get to 19@@ 6@@ 9 , and look what happens ."
"You have com@@ for@@ t , ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence , and social comm@@ ent@@ ary , not only b@@ att@@ ling it out in our society , but you liter@@ ally have two est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment sho@@ ws — &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; G@@ om@@ er P@@ y@@ le &quot; &quot; — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 are the num@@ ber@@ -@@ tw@@ o@@ - and num@@ ber@@ -@@ thre@@ e-@@ r@@ ated t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion sho@@ ws ."
What &apos;s number one ?
"The soci@@ ally ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent hi@@ p@@ pi@@ e show , &quot; R@@ o@@ w@@ an and Mar@@ ti@@ n &apos;s L@@ augh@@ -@@ In . &quot;"
"They &apos;re all living together , right ."
V@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ers had respon@@ ded dra@@ ma@@ tically .
L@@ ook at this gre@@ en spi@@ ke in 19@@ 6@@ 6 to a b@@ ell@@ we@@ ther show .
"When you guys hear this indu@@ stry ter@@ m , a brea@@ k@@ out h@@ it , what does that mean ?"
"It means in the 19@@ 6@@ 6 t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion se@@ as@@ on , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mo@@ thers B@@ ro@@ thers &quot; &quot; came out of no@@ where ."
"This was the first show that allo@@ wed vi@@ e@@ w@@ ers to say , &quot; &quot; My G@@ od , I can com@@ ment on how I feel about the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar , about the pre@@ si@@ d@@ ency , through t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a brea@@ k@@ out show ."
"So then , just like the last ch@@ art , look what happens ."
"In 19@@ 7@@ 0 , the d@@ am bur@@ sts . The d@@ am bur@@ sts ."
C@@ om@@ for@@ t is no longer why we wat@@ ch t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion .
S@@ o@@ ci@@ al comm@@ ent@@ ary and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence ri@@ se throu@@ gh@@ out the 7@@ 0s .

But let me also th@@ ank the incredi@@ ble cre@@ at@@ ors who get up every@@ day to put their ideas on our t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion scre@@ ens throu@@ gh@@ out all these ages of t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion .
"They give it life on t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion , for sure , but it &apos;s you as vi@@ e@@ w@@ ers , through your coll@@ ec@@ tive social con@@ sci@@ ences , that give it life , lon@@ g@@ ev@@ ity , power or not ."
So th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause )
"Well we all know the W@@ or@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b has ab@@ solu@@ tely trans@@ form@@ ed publi@@ sh@@ ing , bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st@@ ing , comm@@ er@@ ce and social connec@@ tivity , but where did it all come from ?"
"And I &apos;ll quot@@ e three people : V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h , D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art and T@@ i@@ m B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ L@@ e@@ e ."
So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
This is V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h .
V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h was the U.@@ S. government &apos;s ch@@ i@@ e@@ f scienti@@ fic ad@@ vi@@ s@@ er during the war .
"And in 19@@ 4@@ 5 , he publi@@ shed an ar@@ tic@@ le in a mag@@ a@@ z@@ ine called A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic M@@ on@@ th@@ ly ."
And the ar@@ tic@@ le was called &quot; &quot; A@@ s We M@@ ay Th@@ ink . &quot; &quot; And what V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h was saying was the way we use information is bro@@ ken .
We don &apos;t work in terms of li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies and c@@ at@@ al@@ o@@ g systems and so for@@ th .
The brain works by as@@ soci@@ ation .
"W@@ ith one it@@ e@@ m in its thought , it s@@ n@@ aps inst@@ an@@ tly to the next it@@ e@@ m ."
And the way information is struc@@ tu@@ red is t@@ ot@@ ally in@@ cap@@ able of ke@@ ep@@ ing up with this process .
"And so he su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ed a machine , and he called it the me@@ me@@ x ."
"And the me@@ me@@ x would l@@ ink information , one piece of information to a rel@@ ated piece of information and so for@@ th ."
Now this was in 19@@ 4@@ 5 .
A computer in those days was something the sec@@ re@@ t serv@@ ices used to use for co@@ de brea@@ king .
And no@@ body knew anything about it .
So this was before the computer was inv@@ ented .
And he pro@@ posed this machine called the me@@ me@@ x .
"And he had a pl@@ at@@ form where you l@@ in@@ ked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will ."
"So sp@@ inning for@@ ward , one of the guys who read this ar@@ tic@@ le was a guy called D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art , and he was a U.@@ S. A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce off@@ ic@@ er ."
And he was read@@ ing it in their li@@ br@@ ary in the F@@ ar E@@ ast .
"And he was so in@@ spi@@ red by this ar@@ tic@@ le , it kind of direc@@ ted the rest of his life ."
"And by the mid@@ -@@ 6@@ 0s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the St@@ an@@ for@@ d R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch L@@ a@@ b in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
He built a system .
"The system was desig@@ ned to au@@ g@@ ment human int@@ ellig@@ ence , it was called ."
"And in a pre@@ mon@@ i@@ tion of today &apos;s world of cl@@ ou@@ d compu@@ ting and so@@ f@@ tw@@ ar@@ es of serv@@ ice , his system was called N@@ L@@ S for o@@ N@@ -@@ L@@ ine S@@ y@@ stem ."
And this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art .
He was gi@@ ving a pres@@ en@@ tation at the F@@ all J@@ o@@ int C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter Con@@ fer@@ ence in 19@@ 6@@ 8 .
"What he sho@@ wed — he s@@ at on a st@@ age like this , and he de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated this system ."
He had his head m@@ ic like I &apos;ve got .
And he works this system .
"And you can see , he &apos;s working between doc@@ um@@ ents and grap@@ h@@ ics and so for@@ th ."
"And he &apos;s dri@@ ving it all with this pl@@ at@@ form here , with a fi@@ v@@ e-@@ f@@ ing@@ er ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard and the world &apos;s first computer m@@ ouse , which he speci@@ ally desig@@ ned in order to do this system ."
So this is where the m@@ ouse came from as well .
So this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art .
The tr@@ ou@@ ble with D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art &apos;s system was that the compu@@ ters in those days cost se@@ ver@@ al million p@@ ounds .
"So for a person@@ al computer , a few million p@@ ounds was like having a person@@ al j@@ et plan@@ e ; it wasn &apos;t really very pr@@ ac@@ tical ."
"But sp@@ in on to the 8@@ 0s when person@@ al compu@@ ters did ar@@ ri@@ ve , then there was room for this kind of system on person@@ al compu@@ ters ."
"And my company , O@@ W@@ L built a system called G@@ u@@ i@@ de for the Ap@@ ple M@@ ac@@ int@@ os@@ h ."
And we deli@@ vered the world &apos;s first hy@@ per@@ t@@ ext system .
And this beg@@ an to get a head of ste@@ am .
"@@ Ap@@ ple int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed a thing called H@@ y@@ per@@ C@@ ard , and they made a bit of a f@@ us@@ s about it ."
They had a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ p@@ age sup@@ ple@@ ment in the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ n@@ al the day it la@@ un@@ ched .
The mag@@ a@@ z@@ ines started to co@@ ver it .
B@@ y@@ te mag@@ a@@ z@@ ine and C@@ om@@ m@@ un@@ ic@@ ations at the A@@ C@@ M had speci@@ al issu@@ es co@@ ver@@ ing hy@@ per@@ t@@ ext .
We develop@@ ed a P@@ C ver@@ sion of this produc@@ t as well as the M@@ ac@@ int@@ os@@ h ver@@ sion .
And our P@@ C ver@@ sion became quite mat@@ ure .
These are some exam@@ ples of this system in action in the l@@ ate 8@@ 0s .
"You were able to deli@@ ver doc@@ um@@ ents , were able to do it over net@@ works ."
We develop@@ ed a system such that it had a mar@@ k@@ up language based on h@@ t@@ m@@ l .
We called it h@@ m@@ l : hy@@ per@@ t@@ ext mar@@ k@@ up language .
"And the system was cap@@ able of doing very , very large doc@@ um@@ en@@ tation systems over computer net@@ works ."
So I took this system to a tra@@ de show in V@@ er@@ sa@@ ill@@ es ne@@ ar P@@ ar@@ is in l@@ ate N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber 199@@ 0 .
"And I was appro@@ ach@@ ed by a n@@ ice young man called T@@ i@@ m B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ L@@ e@@ e who said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you I@@ an R@@ it@@ ch@@ i@@ e ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his pro@@ posed system called the W@@ or@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b ."
"And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pret@@ enti@@ ous name , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally since the whole system r@@ an on his computer in his off@@ ice ."
But he was completely con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that his W@@ or@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b would take over the world one day .
"And he tri@@ ed to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e me to wr@@ ite the bro@@ w@@ s@@ er for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any grap@@ h@@ ics or f@@ on@@ ts or l@@ ay@@ out or anything ; it was just pl@@ ain t@@ ext ."
"I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from C@@ E@@ R@@ N , he &apos;s not going to do this ."
So we didn &apos;t do it .
"In the next couple of years , the hy@@ per@@ t@@ ext community didn &apos;t reco@@ gn@@ ize him ei@@ ther ."
"In 199@@ 2 , his p@@ aper was re@@ jec@@ ted for the H@@ y@@ per@@ t@@ ext Con@@ fer@@ ence ."
"In 199@@ 3 , there was a table at the conf@@ er@@ ence in S@@ e@@ at@@ tle , and a guy called Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ ess@@ en was de@@ mon@@ str@@ ating his little bro@@ w@@ s@@ er for the W@@ or@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b ."
"And I saw it , and I thought , ye@@ p , that &apos;s it ."
"And the very next year , in 199@@ 4 , we had the conf@@ er@@ ence here in E@@ d@@ in@@ bur@@ gh , and I had no op@@ posi@@ tion in having T@@ i@@ m B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ L@@ e@@ e as the ke@@ y@@ n@@ ote spe@@ a@@ ker ."
So that pu@@ ts me in pretty ill@@ u@@ stri@@ ous company .
There was a guy called D@@ ick R@@ o@@ we who was at D@@ ec@@ c@@ a R@@ ec@@ or@@ ds and turned down The B@@ e@@ at@@ les .
"There was a guy called G@@ ary K@@ il@@ d@@ all who went fl@@ ying his plan@@ e when I@@ B@@ M came looking for an oper@@ ating system for the I@@ B@@ M P@@ C , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see B@@ ill G@@ ates ."
"And the 12 publi@@ sh@@ ers who turned down J@@ .@@ K@@ . R@@ o@@ w@@ ling &apos;s H@@ ar@@ ry P@@ ot@@ ter , I gu@@ ess ."
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ ess@@ en who wr@@ ote the world &apos;s first bro@@ w@@ s@@ er for the W@@ or@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b ."
"And ac@@ cor@@ ding to F@@ or@@ tun@@ e mag@@ a@@ z@@ ine , he &apos;s wor@@ th 7@@ 00 million dollars ."
But is he happy ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
"In 199@@ 4 , I wal@@ ked into a pri@@ son in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , and I met a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y who had been t@@ or@@ tu@@ red and was d@@ en@@ i@@ ed ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l ."
"And as I looked into his eyes , I real@@ ized that for the hund@@ re@@ ds of le@@ t@@ ters I had writ@@ ten for poli@@ tical pri@@ son@@ ers , that I would never have writ@@ ten a le@@ tter for him , because he was not a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y who had done something important for any@@ body ."
He was not a poli@@ tical pri@@ son@@ er .
He was a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y who had st@@ ol@@ en a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
"What I also real@@ ized at that point was that it was not only C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , but of the 1@@ 1@@ 3 develop@@ ing countries that t@@ or@@ ture , 9@@ 3 of these countries have all p@@ ass@@ ed la@@ ws that say you have a right to a la@@ w@@ y@@ er and you have a right not to be t@@ or@@ tu@@ red ."
And what I reco@@ gn@@ ized was that there was an incredi@@ ble win@@ d@@ ow of opport@@ un@@ ity for us as a world community to come together and end t@@ or@@ ture as an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ative to@@ o@@ l .
"We often think of t@@ or@@ ture as being poli@@ tical t@@ or@@ ture or re@@ ser@@ ved for just the wor@@ st , but , in fact , 9@@ 5 percent of t@@ or@@ ture today is not for poli@@ tical pri@@ son@@ ers ."
"It is for people who are in bro@@ k@@ en@@ -@@ down le@@ g@@ al systems , and un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately because t@@ or@@ ture is the che@@ ap@@ est form of inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ation — it &apos;s che@@ aper than having a le@@ g@@ al system , che@@ aper than having a la@@ w@@ y@@ er and early ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l — it is what happens most of the time ."
"I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a deci@@ sion , to come together and end t@@ or@@ ture as an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ative to@@ o@@ l in our li@@ fe@@ time , but it will re@@ qu@@ ire three things ."
"F@@ ir@@ st is the tra@@ ining , em@@ power@@ ment , and connec@@ tion of de@@ f@@ end@@ ers wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
The second is in@@ sur@@ ing that there is sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic early ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l .
And the third is comm@@ it@@ ment .
"So in the year 20@@ 00 , I beg@@ an to won@@ der , what if we came together ?"
C@@ ould we do something for these 9@@ 3 countries ?
And I f@@ oun@@ ded Inter@@ national B@@ ri@@ d@@ g@@ es to J@@ us@@ tice which has a speci@@ fic mis@@ sion of en@@ ding t@@ or@@ ture as an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ative to@@ o@@ l and imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting du@@ e process ri@@ ghts in the 9@@ 3 countries by plac@@ ing tra@@ ined la@@ w@@ y@@ ers at an early st@@ age in poli@@ ce st@@ ations and in cour@@ t@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
"M@@ y first experi@@ ences , though , did come from C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , and at the time I remember first coming to C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia and there were , in 199@@ 4 , still less than 10 att@@ or@@ ne@@ ys in the country because the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge had kill@@ ed them all ."
"And even 20 years later , there was only 10 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers in the country , so con@@ sequ@@ ently you &apos;d walk into a pri@@ son and not only would you me@@ et 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ ys , you &apos;d me@@ et women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; W@@ om@@ en would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my h@@ us@@ b@@ and comm@@ it@@ ted a cri@@ me , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no ru@@ le of la@@ w ."
"The first group of de@@ f@@ end@@ ers came together and I still remember , as I was tra@@ ining , I said , &quot; O@@ kay , what do you do for an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ation ? &quot;"
"And there was sil@@ ence in the cl@@ ass , and finally one woman st@@ ood up , &#91; in@@ au@@ di@@ ble name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ re@@ w , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; te@@ ac@@ her . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have de@@ f@@ en@@ ded more than a hund@@ red people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ation , because they all come with conf@@ es@@ sions . &quot; &quot; And we tal@@ ked about , as a cl@@ ass , the fact that number one , the conf@@ es@@ sions might not be reli@@ able , but number two , we did not want to enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge the poli@@ ce to keep doing this , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally as it was now against the la@@ w ."
And it took a lot of cou@@ ra@@ ge for these de@@ f@@ end@@ ers to deci@@ de that they would beg@@ in to st@@ and up and sup@@ port each other in imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting these la@@ ws .
"And I still remember the first c@@ ases where they came , all 25 together , she would st@@ and up , and they were in the back , and they would sup@@ port her , and the ju@@ d@@ g@@ es ke@@ pt saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the ex@@ act same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the per@@ f@@ ect case came , and it was a woman who was a ve@@ ge@@ table sel@@ l@@ er , she was sit@@ ting outside of a house ."
"S@@ he said she actually saw the person run out who she thin@@ ks st@@ ole what@@ ever the j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry was , but the poli@@ ce came , they got her , there was nothing on her ."
She was pre@@ gn@@ ant at the time . She had ci@@ g@@ ar@@ et@@ te bur@@ ns on her . She &apos;d mis@@ car@@ ri@@ ed .
"And when they b@@ rou@@ ght her case to the ju@@ dge , for the first time he st@@ ood up and he said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , there &apos;s no e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence ex@@ cept for your t@@ or@@ ture conf@@ es@@ sion and you will be re@@ le@@ as@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And the de@@ f@@ end@@ ers beg@@ an to take c@@ ases over and over again and you will see , they have ste@@ p by ste@@ p beg@@ an to change the course of history in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia ."
But C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia is not al@@ one .
"I used to think , well is it C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia ?"
O@@ r is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
"In B@@ ur@@ und@@ i I wal@@ ked into a pri@@ son and it wasn &apos;t a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y , it was an 8@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y for ste@@ al@@ ing a mo@@ bi@@ le phone ."
"O@@ r a woman , I pic@@ ked up her bab@@ y , really c@@ ut@@ e bab@@ y , I said &quot; &quot; Y@@ our bab@@ y is so c@@ ut@@ e . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a bab@@ y , she was three ."
"And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was acc@@ used of ste@@ al@@ ing two di@@ ap@@ ers and an ir@@ on for her bab@@ y and still had been in pri@@ son ."
"And when I wal@@ ked up to the pri@@ son direc@@ tor , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out ."
"A ju@@ dge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , we can talk about it , but look at my pri@@ son . E@@ igh@@ ty percent of the two thous@@ and people here are without a la@@ w@@ y@@ er . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So la@@ w@@ y@@ ers beg@@ an to cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously st@@ and up together to organ@@ ize a system where they can take c@@ ases ."
"But we real@@ ized that it &apos;s not only the tra@@ ining of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , but the connec@@ tion of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers that makes a difference ."
"For example , in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , it was that &#91; in@@ au@@ di@@ ble name &#93; did not go al@@ one but she had 2@@ 4 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers with her who st@@ ood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a f@@ res@@ h w@@ ind in the des@@ er@@ t when we can come together . &quot; &quot; O@@ r in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , where I remember In@@ no@@ cent , after coming out of a pri@@ son where everybody st@@ ood up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , e@@ ight years , 12 years without a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a tra@@ ining together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people m@@ um@@ bl@@ ing@@ "
"@@ and gr@@ um@@ bl@@ ing — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we can@@ not help to create j@@ us@@ tice because we do not have the res@@ our@@ ces . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the l@@ ack of res@@ our@@ ces is never an exc@@ use for in@@ j@@ us@@ tice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he suc@@ cess@@ fully organ@@ ized 6@@ 8 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers who have been sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tically taking the c@@ ases ."
"The key that we see , though , is tra@@ ining and then early ac@@ cess ."
"I was rec@@ ently in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , and was in@@ spi@@ red to me@@ et with another group of la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , look , we don &apos;t have poli@@ ce on the stre@@ ets now . The poli@@ ce are one of the ma@@ in reas@@ ons why we had the re@@ vol@@ ution . They were t@@ or@@ tur@@ ing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been ten@@ s of m@@ illions of dollars that have rec@@ ently g@@ one in to the develop@@ ment of the le@@ g@@ al system here ."
"What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the develop@@ ment ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es , and they were tra@@ ining pr@@ os@@ ec@@ ut@@ ors and ju@@ d@@ g@@ es , which is the norm@@ al bi@@ as , as op@@ posed to de@@ f@@ end@@ ers ."
And they sho@@ wed me a man@@ ual which actually was an exc@@ ell@@ ent man@@ ual .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m g@@ on@@ n@@ a cop@@ y this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . L@@ aw@@ y@@ ers can come at the poli@@ ce st@@ ation . It was per@@ f@@ ect ."
P@@ r@@ os@@ ec@@ ut@@ ors were per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly tra@@ ined .
"But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the pr@@ os@@ ec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s off@@ ice , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a p@@ ause , they said , &quot; They had been t@@ or@@ tu@@ red . &quot;"
"So the piec@@ es are , not only the tra@@ ining of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , but us fin@@ ding a way to sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tically imp@@ le@@ ment early ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l , because they are the sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard in the system for people who are being t@@ or@@ tu@@ red ."
"And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the fact that it s@@ ounds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , o@@ kay , it s@@ ounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it s@@ ounds big ."
And there are many reas@@ ons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of cre@@ ating m@@ ir@@ ac@@ les because of their comm@@ it@@ ment .
"It &apos;s not only In@@ no@@ cent , who I told you about in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , but de@@ f@@ end@@ ers all over the world who are looking for these piec@@ es ."
"We have a progra@@ m called J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ M@@ a@@ kers , and we real@@ ized there are people that are cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous and want to do things , but how can we sup@@ port them ?"
So it &apos;s an on@@ line cont@@ est where it &apos;s only five thous@@ and dollars if you come up with and innov@@ ative way of imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting j@@ us@@ tice .
"And there are 30 J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ M@@ a@@ kers throu@@ gh@@ out the world , from S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ k@@ a to S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and to the D@@ R@@ C , who with five thous@@ and dollars do amazing things , through S@@ M@@ S progra@@ ms , through par@@ al@@ e@@ g@@ al progra@@ ms , through what@@ ever they can do ."
"And it &apos;s not only these J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ M@@ a@@ kers , but people we cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously see figure out who their net@@ works are and how they can move it for@@ ward ."
"So in China , for inst@@ ance , great la@@ ws came out where it says poli@@ ce can@@ not t@@ or@@ ture people or they will be p@@ uni@@ shed ."
"And I was sit@@ ting side by side with one of our very cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is imp@@ le@@ men@@ ted ?"
"This is f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s o@@ kay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 4 , he organ@@ ized three thous@@ and mem@@ bers of the Y@@ outh C@@ om@@ m@@ un@@ ist L@@ e@@ ag@@ ue , from 1@@ 4 of the top la@@ w s@@ cho@@ ols , who organ@@ ized themselves , develop@@ ed pos@@ ters with the new la@@ ws , and went to the poli@@ ce st@@ ations and beg@@ an what he says is a non@@ -@@ viol@@ ent le@@ g@@ al re@@ vol@@ ution to prot@@ ect ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ri@@ ghts ."
So I tal@@ ked about the fact that we need to tra@@ in and sup@@ port de@@ f@@ end@@ ers .
We need to sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tically imp@@ le@@ ment early ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l .
But the third and most important thing is that we make a comm@@ it@@ ment to this .
"And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s w@@ il@@ d@@ ly ide@@ al@@ is@@ tic ."
"N@@ ever going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end s@@ la@@ very , or end ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id ."
It beg@@ an with a small group of people who decided they would comm@@ it .
"Now , there &apos;s one of our fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite po@@ ems from the de@@ f@@ end@@ ers , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; T@@ ake cou@@ ra@@ ge friends , the ro@@ ad is often long , the p@@ ath is never cle@@ ar , and the sta@@ kes are very high , but de@@ ep down , you are not al@@ one . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to sup@@ port not only de@@ f@@ end@@ ers , but also everyone in the system who is looking to@@ wards it , we can end t@@ or@@ ture as an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ative to@@ o@@ l ."
"I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . F@@ ir@@ st of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of V@@ i@@ sh@@ n@@ a , who actually was my in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion for star@@ ting Inter@@ national B@@ ri@@ d@@ g@@ es to J@@ us@@ tice ."
"@@ V@@ i@@ sh@@ n@@ a was a 4@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y when I met him who was bor@@ n in a C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ an pri@@ son in K@@ and@@ al P@@ ro@@ v@@ ince . But because he was bor@@ n in the pri@@ son , everybody lo@@ ved him , inclu@@ ding the gu@@ ar@@ ds , so he was the only one who was allo@@ wed to come in and out of the bar@@ s ."
"So , you know , there &apos;s bar@@ s . And by the time that V@@ i@@ sh@@ n@@ a was getting bi@@ g@@ ger , which means what gets bi@@ g@@ ger ? Y@@ our head gets bi@@ g@@ ger ."
"So he would come to the first b@@ ar , the second b@@ ar and then the third b@@ ar , and then really s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly move his head so he could f@@ it through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would gra@@ b my p@@ in@@ ki@@ e , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go vi@@ s@@ it ."

"It goes on for about five minutes , and it has all the things that we h@@ ate about really bad me@@ et@@ ings ."
There &apos;s the mo@@ der@@ ator who has no idea how to run the me@@ e@@ ting .

( V@@ ide@@ o ) P@@ re@@ sen@@ ter : H@@ al@@ ey V@@ an D@@ y@@ c@@ k !
"( Applause ) O@@ ver the course of 1@@ 8 minutes , 1@@ ,@@ 2@@ 00 people , many of wh@@ om have never seen each other before , are fin@@ ding that their bra@@ ins are star@@ ting to sy@@ n@@ c with H@@ al@@ ey &apos;s brain and with each other ."
They &apos;re liter@@ ally beginning to ex@@ hi@@ bit the same bra@@ in@@ -@@ w@@ ave pat@@ ter@@ ns .
And I don &apos;t just mean they &apos;re fe@@ eling the same emo@@ tions .
There &apos;s something even more star@@ t@@ ling happening .
Let &apos;s take a look inside H@@ al@@ ey &apos;s brain for a moment .
There are b@@ illions of inter@@ connec@@ ted neur@@ ons in an im@@ possible t@@ ang@@ le .
"But look here , right here — a few million of them are l@@ in@@ ked to each other in a way which re@@ pres@@ ents a single idea ."
"And incredi@@ bly , this ex@@ act pat@@ ter@@ n is being re@@ created in real time inside the min@@ ds of everyone list@@ ening ."
"That &apos;s right ; in just a few minutes , a pat@@ ter@@ n invol@@ ving m@@ illions of neur@@ ons is being t@@ ele@@ por@@ ted into 1@@ ,@@ 2@@ 00 min@@ ds , just by people list@@ ening to a vo@@ ice and wat@@ ching a face ."
But wa@@ it — what is an idea any@@ way ?
"Well , you can think of it as a pat@@ ter@@ n of information that hel@@ ps you understand and na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate the world ."
"I@@ de@@ as come in all sh@@ ap@@ es and si@@ z@@ es , from the comple@@ x and an@@ al@@ y@@ tical to the simple and a@@ es@@ the@@ tic ."
Here are just a few exam@@ ples shar@@ ed from the TED st@@ age .
S@@ ir K@@ en R@@ ob@@ in@@ son — cre@@ a@@ tivity is key to our kids &apos; future .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) S@@ ir K@@ en R@@ ob@@ in@@ son : My cont@@ en@@ tion is that cre@@ a@@ tivity now is as important in education as liter@@ acy , and we should tre@@ at it with the same st@@ at@@ us ."
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : E@@ l@@ or@@ a H@@ ar@@ dy — building from b@@ am@@ bo@@ o is beautiful .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) E@@ l@@ or@@ a H@@ ar@@ dy : It is gro@@ wing all around us , it &apos;s str@@ ong , it &apos;s ele@@ g@@ ant , it &apos;s ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke@@ -@@ resi@@ st@@ ant ."
C@@ A : C@@ hi@@ ma@@ m@@ and@@ a A@@ dic@@ hi@@ e — people are more than a single id@@ enti@@ ty .
"C@@ A : Y@@ our mind is te@@ em@@ ing with ideas , and not just r@@ and@@ om@@ ly ."
They &apos;re care@@ fully l@@ in@@ ked together .
C@@ ol@@ l@@ ec@@ tively they form an ama@@ z@@ ing@@ ly comple@@ x structure that is your person@@ al wor@@ l@@ d@@ view .
It &apos;s your brain &apos;s oper@@ ating system .
It &apos;s how you na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate the world .
And it is built up out of m@@ illions of individu@@ al ideas .
"So , for example , if one little comp@@ on@@ ent of your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view is the idea that k@@ it@@ ten@@ s are ad@@ or@@ able , then when you see this , you &apos;ll re@@ act like this ."
"But if another comp@@ on@@ ent of your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view is the idea that le@@ op@@ ar@@ ds are d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous , then when you see this , you &apos;ll re@@ act a little bit differ@@ ently ."
"So , it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous why the ideas that make up your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view are cr@@ uc@@ i@@ al ."
"You need them to be as reli@@ able as possible — a gu@@ i@@ de , to the sc@@ ary but wonderful real world out there ."
"Now , different people &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ vi@@ e@@ ws can be dra@@ ma@@ tically different ."
"For example , how does your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view re@@ act when you see this image : ( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ al@@ ia M@@ o@@ ga@@ h@@ ed : What do you think when you look at me ?"
"&quot; &quot; A woman of fa@@ ith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exper@@ t , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a si@@ ster &quot; &quot; ?"
"O@@ r &quot; &quot; op@@ pres@@ sed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bra@@ in@@ was@@ h@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist &quot; &quot; ?"
"C@@ A : Wh@@ at@@ ever your answer , there are m@@ illions of people out there who would re@@ act very differ@@ ently ."
So that &apos;s why ideas really matter .
"If communic@@ ated pro@@ per@@ ly , they &apos;re cap@@ able of chang@@ ing , fore@@ ver , how someone thin@@ ks about the world , and sh@@ ap@@ ing their ac@@ tions both now and well into the future ."
I@@ de@@ as are the most powerful for@@ ce sh@@ ap@@ ing human culture .
"So if you ac@@ cept that your number one t@@ ask as a spe@@ a@@ ker is to build an idea inside the min@@ ds of your au@@ dience , here are four gu@@ id@@ el@@ ines for how you should go about that t@@ ask : One , lim@@ it your talk to just one maj@@ or idea ."
"I@@ de@@ as are comple@@ x things ; you need to s@@ l@@ as@@ h back your cont@@ ent so that you can foc@@ us on the single idea you &apos;re most p@@ as@@ sion@@ ate about , and give y@@ our@@ self a chan@@ ce to expl@@ ain that one thing pro@@ per@@ ly ."
"You have to give cont@@ ext , share exam@@ ples , make it vi@@ vi@@ d ."
"So pic@@ k one idea , and make it the throu@@ gh@@ -@@ line run@@ ning through your entire talk , so that everything you say l@@ in@@ ks back to it in some way ."
"T@@ w@@ o , give your list@@ en@@ ers a reason to care ."
"B@@ e@@ fore you can start building things inside the min@@ ds of your au@@ dience , you have to get their per@@ mis@@ sion to w@@ el@@ come you in ."
And the ma@@ in to@@ o@@ l to ac@@ hi@@ eve that ?
C@@ ur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
S@@ ti@@ r your au@@ dience &apos;s cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
"@@ U@@ se in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing , pro@@ v@@ oc@@ ative questions to id@@ enti@@ f@@ y why something doesn &apos;t make sense and needs expl@@ ain@@ ing ."
"If you can re@@ ve@@ al a dis@@ connec@@ tion in someone &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ view , they &apos;ll feel the need to bri@@ dge that know@@ le@@ dge ga@@ p ."
"And once you &apos;ve sp@@ ar@@ ked that des@@ ire , it will be so much eas@@ i@@ er to start building your idea ."
"Th@@ ree , build your idea , piece by piece , out of con@@ cep@@ ts that your au@@ dience already underst@@ ands ."
"You use the power of language to we@@ ave together con@@ cep@@ ts that already ex@@ ist in your list@@ en@@ ers &apos; min@@ ds — but not your language , their language ."
You start where they are .
"Now , me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors can play a cr@@ uc@@ i@@ al ro@@ le in sho@@ wing how the piec@@ es f@@ it together , because they re@@ ve@@ al the des@@ i@@ red sh@@ ape of the pat@@ ter@@ n , based on an idea that the list@@ en@@ er already underst@@ ands ."
"For example , when J@@ en@@ ni@@ f@@ er K@@ a@@ h@@ n wanted to expl@@ ain the incredi@@ ble new bi@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy called C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R , she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s as if , for the first time , you had a word pro@@ cess@@ or to ed@@ it D@@ N@@ A ."
"C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R allo@@ ws you to c@@ ut and pa@@ st@@ e gen@@ e@@ tic information really eas@@ ily . &quot; &quot; Now , a vi@@ vi@@ d ex@@ plan@@ ation like that deli@@ ver@@ s a sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying a@@ h@@ a moment as it s@@ n@@ aps into place in our min@@ ds ."
"It &apos;s important , ther@@ e@@ fore , to test your talk on tru@@ st@@ ed friends , and find out which par@@ ts they get conf@@ used by ."
"F@@ our , here &apos;s the fin@@ al ti@@ p : M@@ ake your idea wor@@ th shar@@ ing ."
"B@@ y that I mean , ask y@@ our@@ self the question : &quot; Wh@@ o does this idea b@@ ene@@ f@@ it ? &quot;"
And I need you to be h@@ on@@ est with the answer .
"If the idea only ser@@ ves you or your organ@@ ization , then , I &apos;m sor@@ ry to say , it &apos;s probably not wor@@ th shar@@ ing ."
The au@@ dience will see right through you .
"But if you believe that the idea has the pot@@ ential to bri@@ gh@@ ten up someone else &apos;s day or change someone else &apos;s per@@ spec@@ tive for the better or in@@ sp@@ ire someone to do something differ@@ ently , then you have the c@@ ore in@@ gre@@ di@@ ent to a tru@@ ly great talk , one that can be a gi@@ ft to them and to all of us ."
"C@@ an I ask you to ple@@ ase rec@@ all a time when you really lo@@ ved something — a movi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a s@@ ong or a book — and you re@@ comm@@ en@@ ded it wh@@ o@@ le@@ hear@@ te@@ d@@ ly to someone you also really li@@ ked , and you an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated that re@@ action , you wa@@ ited for it , and it came back , and the person h@@ ated it ?"
"So , by way of int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I sp@@ ent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school mat@@ h ."
"I s@@ ell a produc@@ t to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ c@@ ed by la@@ w to bu@@ y it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a l@@ os@@ ing pro@@ posi@@ tion ."
"So there &apos;s a us@@ e@@ ful st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about students that I see , a us@@ e@@ ful st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about you all ."
"I could give you guys an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would exp@@ ect no high@@ er than a 25 percent p@@ ass r@@ ate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call mat@@ h education in the U.@@ S. today .
"T@@ o start with , I &apos;d like to bre@@ ak mat@@ h down into two c@@ ate@@ g@@ or@@ ies ."
One is compu@@ tation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ t@@ or@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ tics with lead@@ ing co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ents gre@@ ater than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , provi@@ ded you have a really str@@ ong gr@@ oun@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the app@@ lic@@ ation of mat@@ h pro@@ cess@@ es to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.@@ S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a mat@@ h te@@ ac@@ her ."
"So first , five sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s that you &apos;re doing mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your cl@@ ass@@ room ."
One is a l@@ ack of in@@ i@@ ti@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your l@@ ec@@ ture b@@ loc@@ k and im@@ medi@@ ately you have five h@@ ands going up as@@ king you to re@@ -@@ expl@@ ain the entire thing at their des@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents l@@ ack per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
"They l@@ ack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find y@@ our@@ self re@@ -@@ expl@@ ain@@ ing con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ale ."
"There &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ sion to word problems , which des@@ cri@@ b@@ es 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the form@@ ul@@ a to app@@ ly in that sit@@ u@@ ation .
This is really de@@ struc@@ tive .
"D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ ator of &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ad@@ w@@ ood &quot; &quot; and other amazing T@@ V sho@@ ws , has a really good des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary dra@@ m@@ a , sho@@ ws set in the present day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ resp@@ ect , it sh@@ ap@@ es the ne@@ ural pa@@ th@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they exp@@ ect simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an im@@ pati@@ ence with ir@@ re@@ sol@@ ution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re im@@ pati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t re@@ sol@@ ve quickly ."
"You exp@@ ect sit@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al brea@@ ks and a l@@ au@@ gh tr@@ ack ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and w@@ ell@@ -@@ being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks — partic@@ ul@@ arly m@@ ass@@ -@@ ad@@ op@@ ted t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks — te@@ ach mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ally equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and call@@ ing it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a phys@@ ics t@@ ex@@ t@@ book .
It app@@ li@@ es equ@@ ally to mat@@ h .
"N@@ o@@ tice , first of all here , that you have exactly three piec@@ es of information there , each of which will figure into a form@@ ul@@ a some@@ where , ev@@ en@@ tually , which the stud@@ ent will then comp@@ ut@@ e ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask y@@ our@@ self , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the given information in adv@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ pl@@ us of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have su@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s ha@@ m@@ str@@ ing@@ ing students because , wat@@ ch this , this is the pr@@ ac@@ tice problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ w@@ app@@ ing out num@@ bers and tw@@ ea@@ king the cont@@ ext a little bit ."
"And if the stud@@ ent still doesn &apos;t reco@@ gn@@ ize the st@@ am@@ p this was m@@ ol@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ fully expl@@ a@@ ins to you what sa@@ m@@ ple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the form@@ ul@@ a ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , p@@ ass this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any phys@@ ics , just kno@@ wing how to dec@@ o@@ de a t@@ ex@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a s@@ ha@@ me ."
So I can di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the problem a little more speci@@ f@@ ically in mat@@ h .
Here &apos;s a really c@@ ool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about de@@ fin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ p@@ e using a sk@@ i li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate l@@ ay@@ ers , and I &apos;m cur@@ i@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate l@@ ay@@ ers and , partic@@ ul@@ arly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pres@@ sed together and pres@@ ented to the stud@@ ent all at once , how that cre@@ ates this im@@ pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll de@@ f@@ ine them here : You have the vi@@ su@@ al .
"You also have the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical structure , talking about g@@ ri@@ ds , meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , l@@ ab@@ els , poin@@ ts , a@@ x@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ ste@@ ps , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which sec@@ tion is the ste@@ ep@@ est ."
So I hope you can see .
"I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a comp@@ elling question , a comp@@ elling answer , but we &apos;re pa@@ ving a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , stra@@ ight p@@ ath from one to the other and con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ating our students for how well they can ste@@ p over the small cr@@ ac@@ ks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the vi@@ su@@ al , and I im@@ medi@@ ately ask the question : Wh@@ ich sec@@ tion is the ste@@ ep@@ est ?"
And this star@@ ts conver@@ sa@@ tion because the vi@@ su@@ al is created in such a way where you can de@@ f@@ end two ans@@ w@@ ers .
"So you get people ar@@ gu@@ ing against each other , friend vers@@ us friend , in pa@@ ir@@ s , jour@@ n@@ al@@ ing , what@@ ever ."
And then ev@@ en@@ tually we real@@ ize it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the s@@ ki@@ er in the lo@@ wer le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the s@@ ki@@ er just ab@@ o@@ ve the m@@ id line .
"And we real@@ ize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D l@@ ab@@ els to talk about them more eas@@ ily ."
"And then as we start to de@@ f@@ ine what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we real@@ ize it would be n@@ ice to have some meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments to really n@@ ar@@ row it down , speci@@ f@@ ically what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ row down that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical structure ."
"The mat@@ h ser@@ ves the conver@@ sa@@ tion , the conver@@ sa@@ tion doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the mat@@ h ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 cl@@ ass@@ es are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ p@@ e , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then devel@@ op those sub@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"D@@ o you guys see how this , right here , com@@ par@@ ed to that — which one cre@@ ates that pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , that mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been obvi@@ ous in my pr@@ ac@@ tice , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ i@@ el@@ d the flo@@ or here for a second to E@@ in@@ ste@@ in , who , I believe , has pa@@ id his du@@ es ."
"He tal@@ ked about the form@@ ulation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my pr@@ ac@@ tice , in the U.@@ S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t invol@@ ve them in the form@@ ulation of the problem ."
So 9@@ 0 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ elling el@@ em@@ ents of problems like this from my t@@ ex@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that sup@@ por@@ ts mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water t@@ ank .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ ir@@ st things first , we e@@ li@@ min@@ ate all the sub@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents have to devel@@ op those , they have to form@@ ul@@ ate those ."
And then no@@ tice that all the information writ@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"N@@ one of it &apos;s a di@@ str@@ ac@@ tor , so we l@@ ose that ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents need to deci@@ de , &quot; &quot; A@@ ll right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the col@@ or of the val@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; S@@ uch an under@@ re@@ pres@@ ented question in mat@@ h curr@@ ic@@ ul@@ um .
So now we have a water t@@ ank .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or c@@ li@@ p art that you so often see in t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real de@@ al .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone f@@ ill@@ ing it up ."
"And it &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ing up s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents are looking at their wat@@ ch@@ es , ro@@ l@@ ling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve b@@ a@@ ited the h@@ ook , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fu@@ n for me because , like the in@@ tr@@ o , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a conver@@ sa@@ tion about mat@@ h because someone else has the form@@ ul@@ a ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the form@@ ul@@ a better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stud@@ ent is on a level play@@ ing fiel@@ d of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion ."
"E@@ very@@ one &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ed something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tically and conver@@ sa@@ tion@@ ally in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated jo@@ ining the conver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"We put nam@@ es on the bo@@ ard , att@@ ach them to gu@@ ess@@ es , and kids have b@@ ou@@ ght in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve des@@ cri@@ bed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better par@@ ts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the te@@ ac@@ her &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion ."
"We , instead , just wat@@ ch the end of the movi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ o@@ re@@ tical mo@@ d@@ els that always work out in the answer key in the back of a te@@ ac@@ her &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s sc@@ ary to talk about sour@@ ces of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ o@@ re@@ tical does not mat@@ ch up with the pr@@ ac@@ tical ."
"But those conver@@ sa@@ tions have been so val@@ u@@ able , am@@ ong the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ port some really fu@@ n g@@ am@@ es with students who come pre@@ -@@ inst@@ all@@ ed with these vir@@ uses day one of the cl@@ ass .
"Th@@ ese are the kids who now , one se@@ me@@ ster in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , t@@ ot@@ ally new , t@@ ot@@ ally fore@@ ig@@ n , and they &apos;ll have a conver@@ sa@@ tion about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fu@@ n ."
"We &apos;re no longer a@@ verse to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ de@@ fin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated by mat@@ h , because we &apos;re s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing what mat@@ h is ."
This has been a lot of fu@@ n .
"I enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge mat@@ h te@@ ach@@ ers I talk to to use mul@@ ti@@ me@@ dia , because it br@@ ings the real world into your cl@@ ass@@ room in high re@@ sol@@ ution and full col@@ or ; to enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge stud@@ ent in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion for that level play@@ ing fiel@@ d ; to ask the sh@@ or@@ test question you possi@@ bly can and let those more speci@@ fic questions come out in conver@@ sa@@ tion ; to let students build the problem , because E@@ in@@ ste@@ in said so ; and to finally , in t@@ ot@@ al , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book is hel@@ ping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ lig@@ ation , for pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving and mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an amazing time to be a mat@@ h te@@ ac@@ her right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality curr@@ ic@@ ul@@ um in our front po@@ c@@ ket .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fa@@ ir@@ ly ch@@ ea@@ p , and the to@@ ols to di@@ stri@@ bu@@ te it fre@@ ely under open lic@@ en@@ ses has also never been che@@ aper or more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a video ser@@ ies on my b@@ lo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vi@@ e@@ ws in two wee@@ ks ."
"I get e@@ ma@@ il@@ s still from te@@ ach@@ ers in countries I &apos;ve never vi@@ s@@ ited saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ a@@ h . We had a good conver@@ sa@@ tion about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow ."
"I put this problem on my b@@ lo@@ g rec@@ ently : In a gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore , which line do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 1@@ 9 it@@ ems or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one it@@ ems ."
"And the l@@ ine@@ ar mo@@ d@@ eling invol@@ ved in that was some good stuff for my cl@@ ass@@ room , but it ev@@ en@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; G@@ ood M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few wee@@ ks later , which is just bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ clu@@ de that people , not just students , are really h@@ un@@ gr@@ y for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary for your own in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion .
"So I just really enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge you , what@@ ever your sta@@ ke is in education — whether you &apos;re a stud@@ ent , par@@ ent , te@@ ac@@ her , po@@ lic@@ y ma@@ ker , what@@ ever — in@@ si@@ st on better mat@@ h curr@@ ic@@ ul@@ um ."
We need more pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
It means to play so@@ f@@ tly .
"If you &apos;re play@@ ing a mus@@ ical in@@ str@@ um@@ ent and you no@@ tice a &quot; &quot; p &quot; &quot; in the sc@@ ore , you need to play so@@ f@@ ter ."
T@@ w@@ o p &apos;s — even so@@ f@@ ter .
F@@ our p &apos;s — extre@@ me@@ ly so@@ ft .
"This is my dra@@ wing of a p@@ -@@ t@@ ree , which de@@ mon@@ str@@ ates no matter how many thousands up@@ on thousands of p &apos;s there may be , you &apos;ll never re@@ ach comple@@ te sil@@ ence ."
That &apos;s my curr@@ ent de@@ fin@@ i@@ tion of sil@@ ence : a very ob@@ sc@@ ure sound .
"I &apos;d like to share a little bit about the history of American S@@ ig@@ n L@@ an@@ gu@@ age , A@@ S@@ L , pl@@ us a bit of my own bac@@ k@@ ground ."
"F@@ r@@ en@@ ch sig@@ n language was b@@ rou@@ ght to America during the early 1@@ 8@@ 0@@ 0s , and as time went by , mi@@ x@@ ed with local sig@@ ns , it evol@@ ved into the language we know today as A@@ S@@ L ."
So it has a history of about 2@@ 00 years .
"I was bor@@ n de@@ a@@ f , and I was ta@@ u@@ ght to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life ."
And I beli@@ ev@@ ed it to be true .
"@@ Y@@ et , I real@@ ize now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all ."
"S@@ ound was very much a part of my life , really , on my mind every day ."
"As a D@@ ea@@ f person living in a world of sound , it &apos;s as if I was living in a fore@@ ig@@ n country , bl@@ in@@ d@@ ly fol@@ lo@@ wing its r@@ ules , cu@@ st@@ om@@ s , behavi@@ ors and n@@ or@@ ms without ever ques@@ tion@@ ing them ."
So how is it that I understand sound ?
"Well , I wat@@ ch how people be@@ have and respon@@ d to sound ."
"You people are like my l@@ ou@@ d@@ spe@@ a@@ kers , and am@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y sound ."
I learn and m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r that behavi@@ or .
"A@@ t the same time , I &apos;ve learned that I create sound , and I &apos;ve seen how people respon@@ d to me ."
"Th@@ us I &apos;ve learned , for example ..@@ ."
&quot; D@@ on &apos;t s@@ la@@ m the do@@ or ! &quot;
&quot; D@@ on &apos;t make too much no@@ ise when you &apos;re e@@ ating from the pot@@ at@@ o@@ -@@ ch@@ i@@ p b@@ a@@ g ! &quot;
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t bur@@ p , and when you &apos;re e@@ ating , make sure you don &apos;t sc@@ r@@ ape your ut@@ en@@ sil@@ s on the pl@@ ate . &quot; &quot; A@@ ll of these things I ter@@ m &quot; &quot; sound e@@ ti@@ qu@@ et@@ te . &quot; &quot; M@@ ay@@ be I think about sound e@@ ti@@ qu@@ et@@ te more than the a@@ ver@@ age hear@@ ing person does ."
I &apos;m hy@@ per@@ -@@ vi@@ g@@ il@@ ant around sound .
"And I &apos;m always wa@@ iting in e@@ ag@@ er ner@@ v@@ ous an@@ tici@@ p@@ ation around sound , about what &apos;s to come next ."
"H@@ ence , this dra@@ wing ."
"T@@ B@@ D , to be decided ."
"T@@ B@@ C , to be contin@@ u@@ ed ."
"T@@ B@@ A , to be an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ed ."
And you no@@ tice the sta@@ ff — there are no n@@ ot@@ es con@@ ta@@ ined in the l@@ ines .
That &apos;s because the l@@ ines already con@@ tain sound through the sub@@ tle sm@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ es and s@@ me@@ ar@@ s .
"In D@@ ea@@ f culture , movement is equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to sound ."
This is a sig@@ n for &quot; &quot; sta@@ ff &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
A typ@@ ical sta@@ ff con@@ ta@@ ins five l@@ ines .
"@@ Y@@ et for me , sig@@ ning it with my th@@ um@@ b s@@ tic@@ king up like that doesn &apos;t feel natural ."
"That &apos;s why you &apos;ll no@@ tice in my dra@@ w@@ ings , I s@@ tic@@ k to four l@@ ines on p@@ aper ."
"In the year 200@@ 8 , I had the opport@@ un@@ ity to tra@@ v@@ el to B@@ er@@ l@@ in , G@@ er@@ many , for an arti@@ st resi@@ d@@ ency there ."
"P@@ ri@@ or to this time , I had been working as a pa@@ in@@ ter ."
"D@@ uring this sum@@ m@@ er , I vi@@ s@@ ited different mus@@ e@@ um@@ s and g@@ all@@ ery sp@@ ac@@ es , and as I went from one place to the next , I no@@ tic@@ ed there was no vi@@ su@@ al art there ."
"A@@ t that time , sound was tr@@ en@@ ding , and this struc@@ k me ..@@ ."
"@@ there was no vi@@ su@@ al art , everything was au@@ d@@ it@@ ory ."
Now sound has come into my art ter@@ r@@ it@@ ory .
I@@ s it going to f@@ ur@@ ther dist@@ ance me from art ?
I real@@ ized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
I actually know sound .
I know it so well that it doesn &apos;t have to be something just experi@@ enc@@ ed through the ear@@ s .
"It could be felt t@@ actually , or experi@@ enc@@ ed as a vi@@ su@@ al , or even as an idea ."
So I decided to re@@ cl@@ a@@ i@@ m o@@ w@@ ner@@ ship of sound and to put it into my art pr@@ ac@@ tice .
"And everything that I had been ta@@ u@@ ght reg@@ ar@@ ding sound , I decided to do away with and un@@ learn ."
I started cre@@ ating a new body of work .
"And when I pres@@ ented this to the art community , I was b@@ lo@@ wn away with the amoun@@ t of sup@@ port and at@@ ten@@ tion I re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved ."
"I real@@ ized : sound is like money , power , control — social curr@@ ency ."
"In the back of my mind , I &apos;ve always felt that sound was your thing , a hear@@ ing person &apos;s thing ."
"And sound is so powerful that it could ei@@ ther dise@@ m@@ power me and my ar@@ t@@ work , or it could em@@ power me ."
I ch@@ ose to be em@@ power@@ ed .
There &apos;s a m@@ as@@ sive culture around sp@@ o@@ ken language .
"And just because I don &apos;t use my liter@@ al vo@@ ice to communic@@ ate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a vo@@ ice at all ."
So I need to work with individu@@ als who can sup@@ port me as an equ@@ al and become my vo@@ ice .
"And that way , I &apos;m able to ma@@ in@@ tain re@@ lev@@ anc@@ y in society today ."
"So at school , at work and institu@@ tions , I work with many different A@@ S@@ L inter@@ pre@@ ters ."
And their vo@@ ice bec@@ omes my vo@@ ice and id@@ enti@@ ty .
They help me to be heard .
And their vo@@ ices h@@ old val@@ ue and curr@@ ency .
"I@@ r@@ on@@ ically , by bor@@ ro@@ wing out their vo@@ ices , I &apos;m able to ma@@ in@@ tain a tem@@ por@@ ary form of curr@@ ency , kind of like taking out a lo@@ an with a very high inter@@ est r@@ ate ."
"If I didn &apos;t contin@@ ue this pr@@ ac@@ tice , I feel that I could just f@@ ad@@ e off into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on and not ma@@ in@@ tain any form of social curr@@ ency ."
"So with sound as my new art medi@@ um , I d@@ el@@ ved into the world of music ."
And I was surpri@@ sed to see the sim@@ il@@ ari@@ ties between music and A@@ S@@ L .
"For example , a mus@@ ical n@@ ote can@@ not be fully cap@@ tu@@ red and ex@@ pres@@ sed on p@@ aper ."
And the same hol@@ ds true for a con@@ cept in A@@ S@@ L .
They &apos;re both high@@ ly sp@@ a@@ ti@@ al and high@@ ly in@@ fl@@ ected — me@@ an@@ ing that sub@@ tle chang@@ es can aff@@ ect the entire me@@ an@@ ing of both sig@@ ns and s@@ ounds .
"I &apos;d like to share with you a pi@@ an@@ o me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or , to have you have a better underst@@ anding of how A@@ S@@ L works ."
"So , en@@ vi@@ sion a pi@@ an@@ o ."
A@@ S@@ L is bro@@ ken down into many different gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical par@@ a@@ me@@ ters .
"If you as@@ sig@@ n a different par@@ a@@ me@@ ter to each f@@ ing@@ er as you play the pi@@ an@@ o — such as fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sion , body movement , spe@@ ed , hand sh@@ ape and so on , as you play the pi@@ an@@ o — En@@ g@@ li@@ sh is a l@@ ine@@ ar language , as if one key is being pres@@ sed at a time ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , A@@ S@@ L is more like a ch@@ ord — all 10 f@@ ing@@ ers need to come down sim@@ ul@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously to ex@@ pres@@ s a cle@@ ar con@@ cept or idea in A@@ S@@ L ."
"If just one of those ke@@ ys were to change the ch@@ ord , it would create a completely different me@@ an@@ ing ."
"The same app@@ li@@ es to music in reg@@ ar@@ ds to p@@ it@@ ch , t@@ one and vol@@ u@@ me ."
"In A@@ S@@ L , by play@@ ing around with these different gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical par@@ a@@ me@@ ters , you can ex@@ pres@@ s different ideas ."
"For example , take the sig@@ n T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T ."
This is the sig@@ n T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T .
I &apos;m looking at you .
St@@ ar@@ ing at you .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Oh — bu@@ st@@ ed . ( Laughter )
U@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h .
What are you looking at ?
"A@@ w , stop ."
"( Laughter ) I then started thinking , &quot; What if I was to look at A@@ S@@ L through a mus@@ ical l@@ ens ? &quot;"
"If I was to create a sig@@ n and re@@ pe@@ at it over and over , it could become like a piece of vi@@ su@@ al music ."
"For example , this is the sig@@ n for &quot; &quot; day , &quot; &quot; as the su@@ n ri@@ ses and se@@ ts ."
"This is &quot; &quot; all day . &quot; &quot; If I was to re@@ pe@@ at it and s@@ low it down , vi@@ su@@ ally it looks like a piece of music ."
A@@ ll ... day .
I feel the same hol@@ ds true for &quot; &quot; all night . &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ ll night . &quot;
"This is A@@ L@@ L@@ -@@ N@@ I@@ G@@ H@@ T , re@@ pres@@ ented in this dra@@ wing ."
"And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of ni@@ ghts : &quot; last night , &quot; &quot; o@@ vern@@ ight , &quot; ( S@@ ings ) &quot; &quot; all night long . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I feel like the third one has a lot more mus@@ ic@@ ality than the other two . ( Laughter )"
This re@@ pres@@ ents how time is ex@@ pres@@ sed in A@@ S@@ L and how the dist@@ ance from your body can ex@@ pres@@ s the chang@@ es in time .
"For example , 1@@ H is one hand , 2@@ H is two hand , present ten@@ se happens clos@@ est and in front of the body , future is in front of the body and the past is to your back ."
"So , the first example is &quot; &quot; a long time ago . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en &quot; &quot; past , &quot; &quot; &quot; used to &quot; and the last one , which is my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite , with the very r@@ om@@ an@@ tic and dra@@ ma@@ tic no@@ tion to it , &quot; once up@@ on a time . &quot;"
( Laughter ) &quot; C@@ om@@ m@@ on time &quot; is a mus@@ ical ter@@ m with a speci@@ fic time sig@@ nature of four be@@ ats per meas@@ ure .
"@@ Y@@ et when I see the word &quot; &quot; common time , &quot; &quot; what au@@ tom@@ a@@ tically comes to mind for me is &quot; &quot; at the same time . &quot; &quot; So no@@ tice R@@ H : right hand , L@@ H : left hand ."
We have the sta@@ ff across the head and the ch@@ est .
"E@@ very@@ body , h@@ ands up ."
"Now we &apos;re going to do it in both the head and the ch@@ est , kind of like &quot; &quot; common time &quot; &quot; or at the same time ."
"@@ Y@@ es , got it ."
That means &quot; &quot; to f@@ all in love &quot; &quot; in Inter@@ national &#91; S@@ ig@@ n &#93; .
"( Laughter ) Inter@@ national &#91; S@@ ig@@ n &#93; , as a n@@ ote , is a vi@@ su@@ al to@@ o@@ l to help communic@@ ate across cul@@ tures and sig@@ n langu@@ ages around the world ."
The second one I &apos;d like to de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate is this — ple@@ ase fol@@ low along with me again .
And now this .
This is &quot; &quot; col@@ on@@ ization &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
( Laughter ) Now the third — ple@@ ase fol@@ low along again .
And again .
This is &quot; &quot; en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
So let &apos;s do all three together .
"&quot; F@@ all in love , &quot; &quot; col@@ on@@ ization &quot; and &quot; &quot; en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot; &quot; G@@ ood job , everyone ."
"( Laughter ) N@@ o@@ tice how all three sig@@ ns are very sim@@ il@@ ar , they all happen at the head and the ch@@ est , but they con@@ v@@ ey quite different me@@ an@@ ings ."
"So it &apos;s amazing to see how A@@ S@@ L is ali@@ ve and th@@ ri@@ ving , just like music is ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , in this day and age , we live in a very au@@ di@@ o@@ -@@ cent@@ ri@@ c world ."
"And just because A@@ S@@ L has no sound to it , it au@@ tom@@ a@@ tically hol@@ ds no social curr@@ ency ."
We need to start thinking har@@ der about what de@@ fin@@ es social curr@@ ency and al@@ low A@@ S@@ L to devel@@ op its own form of curr@@ ency — without sound .
And this could possi@@ bly be a ste@@ p to le@@ ad to a more in@@ cl@@ us@@ ive society .
"And maybe people will understand that you don &apos;t need to be de@@ a@@ f to learn A@@ S@@ L , n@@ or do you have to be hear@@ ing to learn music ."
A@@ S@@ L is such a r@@ ich tre@@ as@@ ure that I &apos;d like you to have the same experience .
"And I &apos;d like to inv@@ ite you to open your ear@@ s , to open your eyes , take part in our culture and experience our vi@@ su@@ al language ."
"And you never know , you might just f@@ all in love with us ."
( Applause ) Thank you .
"D@@ en@@ ise K@@ a@@ h@@ l@@ er@@ -@@ B@@ ra@@ at@@ en : H@@ ey , that &apos;s me ."
( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ r@@ o C@@ or@@ por@@ ation of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of pl@@ as@@ tic with a R@@ a@@ di@@ o S@@ h@@ ack an@@ ten@@ n@@ a att@@ ach@@ ed to it .
So that &apos;s just a fu@@ n little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ ort of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing comp@@ a@@ ti@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a B@@ u@@ ick hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ al@@ il@@ e@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e to S@@ at@@ ur@@ n ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the side of a gl@@ ass win@@ d@@ ow in S@@ a@@ o P@@ a@@ ul@@ o .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
"H@@ ere &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the bac@@ k@@ side , which they started to wi@@ p@@ e off ."
I was bor@@ n and ra@@ is@@ ed in N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a .
"A@@ l@@ though my family con@@ st@@ an@@ tly str@@ u@@ gg@@ led against po@@ ver@@ ty , I was always lo@@ ved and car@@ ed for first , because I was the only son and the youn@@ g@@ est of two in the family ."
But then the great fam@@ ine beg@@ an in 199@@ 4 .
I was four years old .
My si@@ ster and I would go sear@@ ching for fi@@ re@@ w@@ ood star@@ ting at 5 in the mor@@ ning and come back after mid@@ night .
"I would wan@@ der the stre@@ ets sear@@ ching for food , and I remember seeing a small child ti@@ ed to a mother &apos;s back e@@ ating ch@@ i@@ ps , and wan@@ ting to ste@@ al them from him ."
H@@ un@@ ger is hum@@ ili@@ ation . H@@ un@@ ger is hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
"For a h@@ un@@ gr@@ y child , poli@@ tics and fre@@ e@@ dom are not even thought of ."
"O@@ n my n@@ in@@ th b@@ ir@@ th@@ day , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to e@@ at ."
"But even as a child , I could feel the he@@ av@@ iness in their hear@@ ts ."
"O@@ ver a million N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans died of star@@ v@@ ation in that time , and in 200@@ 3 , when I was 1@@ 3 years old , my father became one of them ."
I saw my father wi@@ ther away and di@@ e .
"In the same year , my mother dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed one day , and then my si@@ ster told me that she was going to China to ear@@ n money , but that she would re@@ turn with money and food so@@ on ."
"S@@ ince we had never been se@@ par@@ ated , and I thought we would be together fore@@ ver , I didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g when she left ."
It was the bi@@ gg@@ est m@@ ist@@ ake I have ever made in my life .
"But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
I have not seen my mo@@ m or my si@@ ster since then .
"S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , I became an or@@ ph@@ an and h@@ om@@ el@@ ess ."
"M@@ y d@@ a@@ ily life became very hard , but very simple ."
My go@@ al was to find a du@@ st@@ y piece of bre@@ ad in the tr@@ as@@ h .
But that is no way to survi@@ ve .
"I started to real@@ ize , beg@@ g@@ ing would not be the sol@@ ution ."
So I started to ste@@ al from food car@@ ts in il@@ le@@ g@@ al mar@@ ke@@ ts .
"S@@ ome@@ times , I found small j@@ ob@@ s in ex@@ change for food ."
"O@@ n@@ ce , I even sp@@ ent two months in the win@@ ter working in a co@@ al m@@ ine , 3@@ 3 me@@ ters under@@ ground without any prot@@ ection for up to 1@@ 6 hours a day ."
I was not un@@ common .
"M@@ any other or@@ ph@@ ans survi@@ ved this way , or wor@@ se ."
"When I could not f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep from b@@ it@@ ter co@@ ld or h@@ un@@ ger pa@@ ins , I hop@@ ed that , the next mor@@ ning , my si@@ ster would come back to wa@@ ke me up with my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite food ."
That hope ke@@ pt me ali@@ ve .
"I don &apos;t mean big , gr@@ and hope ."
"I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next tr@@ as@@ h can had bre@@ ad , even though it us@@ u@@ ally didn &apos;t ."
"But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I w@@ ouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would di@@ e ."
H@@ op@@ e ke@@ pt me ali@@ ve .
"E@@ very day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live ."
"A@@ f@@ ter three years of wa@@ iting for my si@@ ster &apos;s re@@ turn , I decided to go to China to look for her myself ."
I real@@ ized I couldn &apos;t survi@@ ve much longer this way .
"I knew the jour@@ ney would be ri@@ sk@@ y , but I would be ris@@ king my life ei@@ ther way ."
"I could di@@ e of star@@ v@@ ation like my father in N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , or at least I could try for a better life by es@@ cap@@ ing to China ."
I had learned that many people tri@@ ed to cr@@ oss the bor@@ der to China in the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time to av@@ o@@ id being seen .
N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ an bor@@ der gu@@ ar@@ ds often sh@@ oo@@ t and k@@ ill people trying to cr@@ oss the bor@@ der without per@@ mis@@ sion .
"@@ Chin@@ ese sol@@ di@@ ers will c@@ at@@ ch and s@@ end back N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans , where they face se@@ v@@ ere p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment ."
"I decided to cr@@ oss during the day , first because I was still a k@@ id and sc@@ ar@@ ed of the dar@@ k , second because I knew I was already taking a ris@@ k , and since not many people tri@@ ed to cr@@ oss during the day , I thought I might be able to cr@@ oss without being seen by any@@ one ."
"I made it to China on F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary 15 , 200@@ 6 ."
I was 1@@ 6 years old .
"I thought things in China would be eas@@ i@@ er , since there was more food ."
I thought more people would help me .
"But it was har@@ der than living in N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , because I was not free ."
I was always wor@@ ri@@ ed about being c@@ au@@ ght and s@@ ent back .
"B@@ y a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le , some months later , I met someone who was run@@ ning an under@@ ground sh@@ el@@ ter for N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans , and was allo@@ wed to live there and e@@ at reg@@ ular me@@ als for the first time in many years ."
"L@@ ater that year , an ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st hel@@ ped me es@@ cap@@ e China and go to the United States as a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ."
"I went to America without kno@@ wing a word of En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , yet my social wor@@ ker told me that I had to go to high school ."
"E@@ ven in N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , I was an F stud@@ ent ."
( Laughter ) And I bar@@ ely fin@@ i@@ shed el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school .
And I remember I f@@ ou@@ ght in school more than once a day .
T@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks and the li@@ br@@ ary were not my play@@ ground .
"M@@ y father tri@@ ed very hard to mo@@ tiv@@ ate me into stud@@ ying , but it didn &apos;t work ."
"A@@ t one point , my father gave up on me ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son any@@ more . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it h@@ ur@@ t me de@@ ep@@ ly ."
"But ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , my level of mo@@ tiv@@ ation still didn &apos;t change before he died ."
"So in America , it was kind of ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous that they said I should go to high school ."
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
"I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much ."
"But one day , I came home and my f@@ os@@ ter mother had made ch@@ ic@@ ken w@@ ings for d@@ in@@ ner ."
"And during d@@ in@@ ner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I real@@ ized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it ."
"When I looked down at my pl@@ ate , I saw the last ch@@ ic@@ ken wing , that my f@@ os@@ ter father had given me his ."
I was so happy .
I looked at him sit@@ ting next to me .
"He just looked back at me very war@@ m@@ ly , but said no words ."
S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed my bio@@ logical father .
"M@@ y f@@ os@@ ter father &apos;s small act of love re@@ min@@ ded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was h@@ un@@ gr@@ y , even if he was star@@ ving ."
"I felt so su@@ ff@@ oc@@ ated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of star@@ v@@ ation ."
"M@@ y only w@@ ish that night was to c@@ ook a me@@ al for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to h@@ on@@ or him ."
And my answer was to pr@@ om@@ ise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to h@@ on@@ or his s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice .
"I took school ser@@ i@@ ously , and for the first time ever in my life , I re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved an ac@@ a@@ de@@ m@@ ic a@@ ward for exc@@ ell@@ ence , and made de@@ an &apos;s li@@ st from the first se@@ me@@ ster in high school ."
( Applause ) That ch@@ ic@@ ken wing changed my life .
( Laughter ) H@@ op@@ e is person@@ al . H@@ op@@ e is something that no one can give to you .
You have to cho@@ ose to believe in hope .
You have to make it y@@ our@@ self .
"In N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , I made it myself ."
H@@ op@@ e b@@ rou@@ ght me to America .
"But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"M@@ y f@@ os@@ ter father at that d@@ in@@ ner gave me a direc@@ tion , and he mo@@ tiv@@ ated me and gave me a pur@@ p@@ ose to live in America ."
I did not come here by myself .
"I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough ."
M@@ any people hel@@ ped me along the way to get here .
N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans are fi@@ gh@@ ting hard to survi@@ ve .
"They have to for@@ ce themselves to survi@@ ve , have hope to survi@@ ve , but they can@@ not make it without help ."
This is my mess@@ age to you .
"H@@ ave hope for y@@ our@@ self , but also help each other ."
"L@@ i@@ fe can be hard for everyone , wh@@ er@@ ever you live ."
My f@@ os@@ ter father didn &apos;t int@@ end to change my life .
"In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the sm@@ all@@ est act of love ."
"A piece of bre@@ ad can sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y your h@@ un@@ ger , and having the hope will bring you bre@@ ad to keep you ali@@ ve ."
But I con@@ fi@@ d@@ ently believe that your act of love and car@@ ing can also sa@@ ve another J@@ os@@ ep@@ h &apos;s life and change thousands of other J@@ os@@ e@@ ph@@ s who are still having hope to survi@@ ve .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) A@@ dri@@ an H@@ ong : J@@ os@@ ep@@ h , th@@ ank you for shar@@ ing that very person@@ al and speci@@ al story with us ."
"I know you ha@@ ven &apos;t seen your si@@ ster for , you said , it was almost exactly a decad@@ e , and in the off chan@@ ce that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opport@@ un@@ ity to s@@ end her a mess@@ age ."

"( Laughter ) Y@@ es , I &apos;m just looking for@@ ward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day ."

I just wanted to say th@@ ank you for le@@ tting me be in this world .
Thank you .
( Applause )
How many of you had to f@@ ill out some sort of we@@ b form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a di@@ stor@@ ted sequ@@ ence of char@@ ac@@ ters like this ?
"@@ How many of you found it really , really an@@ no@@ ying ?"
"O@@ kay , out@@ st@@ anding . So I inv@@ ented that ."
( Laughter ) O@@ r I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
"And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the enti@@ ty f@@ ill@@ ing out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer progra@@ m that was writ@@ ten to sub@@ m@@ it the form m@@ illions and m@@ illions of times ."
"The reason it works is because hum@@ ans , at least non@@ -@@ vi@@ su@@ all@@ y-@@ im@@ pa@@ i@@ red hum@@ ans , have no tr@@ ou@@ ble read@@ ing these di@@ stor@@ ted s@@ qu@@ ig@@ g@@ ly char@@ ac@@ ters , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as computer progra@@ ms sim@@ ply can &apos;t do it as well yet ."
"So for example , in the case of T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ ma@@ ster , the reason you have to typ@@ e these di@@ stor@@ ted char@@ ac@@ ters is to pre@@ v@@ ent sc@@ al@@ per@@ s from wr@@ iting a progra@@ m that can bu@@ y m@@ illions of tic@@ ke@@ ts , two at a time ."
C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are used all over the Internet .
"And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the pre@@ ci@@ se sequ@@ ence of ran@@ dom char@@ ac@@ ters that is sho@@ wn to the us@@ er is not so for@@ tun@@ ate ."
So this is an example from the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o re@@ gi@@ stra@@ tion p@@ age .
"The ran@@ dom char@@ ac@@ ters that happened to be sho@@ wn to the us@@ er were W , A , I , T , which , of course , sp@@ ell a word ."
But the best part is the mess@@ age that the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o help des@@ k got about 20 minutes later .
"T@@ ext : &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ p ! I &apos;ve been wa@@ iting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wa@@ it ."
"This of course , is not as bad as this po@@ or person ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A P@@ ro@@ ject is something that we did here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ l@@ on over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used every@@ where ."
"L@@ et me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evol@@ ution of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"This is a project that we call re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , which is something that we started here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ on , then we turned it into a star@@ tu@@ p company ."
"And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually ac@@ qui@@ red this company ."
So let me tell you what this project started .
So this project started from the fol@@ lo@@ wing real@@ ization : It turns out that appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately 2@@ 00 million C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are typ@@ ed every@@ day by people around the world .
"When I first heard this , I was quite p@@ rou@@ d of myself ."
"I thought , look at the imp@@ act that my research has had ."
But then I started fe@@ eling bad .
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , each time you typ@@ e a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , ess@@ enti@@ ally you wa@@ st@@ e 10 secon@@ ds of your time ."
"And if you mul@@ ti@@ ply that by 2@@ 00 million , you get that hum@@ an@@ ity as a whole is wa@@ st@@ ing about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 hours every day typ@@ ing these an@@ no@@ ying C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s ."
So then I started fe@@ eling bad .
"( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get ri@@ d of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s , because the sec@@ ur@@ ity of the W@@ e@@ b sort of dep@@ ends on them ."
"But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this eff@@ ort for something that is good for hum@@ an@@ ity ?"
"So see , here &apos;s the thing ."
"Wh@@ ile you &apos;re typ@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , during those 10 secon@@ ds , your brain is doing something amazing ."
Y@@ our brain is doing something that compu@@ ters can@@ not yet do .
So can we get you to do us@@ e@@ ful work for those 10 secon@@ ds ?
"A@@ no@@ ther way of p@@ ut@@ ting it is , is there some hum@@ on@@ g@@ ous problem that we can@@ not yet get compu@@ ters to sol@@ ve , yet we can s@@ pl@@ it into tin@@ y 1@@ 0-@@ second ch@@ un@@ ks such that each time somebody sol@@ ves a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A they sol@@ ve a little bit of this problem ?"
"And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; y@@ es , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now ."
"So what you may not know is that no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays while you &apos;re typ@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , not only are you au@@ th@@ en@@ tic@@ ating y@@ our@@ self as a human , but in ad@@ di@@ tion you &apos;re actually hel@@ ping us to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze bo@@ o@@ ks ."
So let me expl@@ ain how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of pro@@ jects out there trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze bo@@ o@@ ks .
Google has one . The Internet Ar@@ ch@@ ive has one .
"A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , now with the K@@ in@@ dle , is trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze bo@@ o@@ ks ."
B@@ as@@ ically the way this works is you start with an old book .
"You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? L@@ i@@ ke a book ?"
"( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you s@@ can it ."
Now sc@@ an@@ ning a book is like taking a dig@@ ital photograp@@ h of every p@@ age of the book .
It gi@@ ves you an image for every p@@ age of the book .
This is an image with t@@ ext for every p@@ age of the book .
The next ste@@ p in the process is that the computer needs to be able to deci@@ ph@@ er all of the words in this image .
"That &apos;s using a technology called O@@ C@@ R , for op@@ tical char@@ ac@@ ter reco@@ g@@ ni@@ tion , which takes a picture of t@@ ext and tries to figure out what t@@ ext is in there ."
Now the problem is that O@@ C@@ R is not per@@ f@@ ect .
"E@@ speci@@ ally for ol@@ der bo@@ o@@ ks where the ink has f@@ ad@@ ed and the p@@ ages have turned y@@ el@@ low , O@@ C@@ R can@@ not reco@@ gn@@ ize a lot of the words ."
"For example , for things that were writ@@ ten more than 50 years ago , the computer can@@ not reco@@ gn@@ ize about 30 percent of the words ."
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer can@@ not reco@@ gn@@ ize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re typ@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A on the Internet .
"So the next time you typ@@ e a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , these words that you &apos;re typ@@ ing are actually words that are coming from bo@@ o@@ ks that are being di@@ gi@@ ti@@ z@@ ed that the computer could not reco@@ gn@@ ize ."
"And now the reason we have two words no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you ."
"But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it can@@ not gra@@ de it for you ."
"So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer ."
"We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , ple@@ ase typ@@ e both ."
"And if you typ@@ e the cor@@ rec@@ t word for the one for which the system already kno@@ ws the answer , it ass@@ um@@ es you are human , and it also gets some con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence that you typ@@ ed the other word cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And if we re@@ pe@@ at this process to like 10 different people and all of them ag@@ ree on what the new word is , then we get one more word di@@ gi@@ ti@@ z@@ ed ac@@ cur@@ ately ."
So this is how the system works .
"And basically , since we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed it about three or four years ago , a lot of we@@ b@@ sit@@ es have started s@@ w@@ it@@ ching from the old C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people wa@@ st@@ ed their time to the new C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people are hel@@ ping to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze bo@@ o@@ ks ."
"So for example , T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ ma@@ ster ."
"So every time you bu@@ y tic@@ ke@@ ts on T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ ma@@ ster , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"F@@ ace@@ book : E@@ very time you ad@@ d a friend or po@@ ke somebody , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"T@@ w@@ it@@ ter and about 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 other sit@@ es are all using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"And in fact , the number of sit@@ es that are using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing per day is really , really large ."
"It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of about two and a half million bo@@ o@@ ks a year ."
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typ@@ ing C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s on the Internet .
"( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , fun@@ n@@ y things can happen ."
And this is es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally true because now we &apos;re gi@@ ving people two r@@ and@@ om@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en En@@ g@@ li@@ sh words next to each other .
So fun@@ n@@ y things can happen .
"For example , we pres@@ ented this word ."
It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
"But if you present it along with another r@@ and@@ om@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en word , bad things can happen ."
"So we get this . ( T@@ ext : bad ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans ) But it &apos;s even wor@@ se , because the particular we@@ b@@ s@@ ite where we sho@@ wed this actually happened to be called The E@@ m@@ bas@@ s@@ y of the K@@ ing@@ dom of G@@ od ."
( Laughter ) O@@ op@@ s . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ E@@ d@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m ( T@@ ext : D@@ am@@ n li@@ ber@@ al ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on in@@ s@@ ul@@ ting people left and right every@@ day .
"Now , of course , we &apos;re not just in@@ s@@ ul@@ ting people ."
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re pres@@ en@@ ting two r@@ and@@ om@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en words , interesting things can happen ."
"So this actually has given ri@@ se to a really big Internet me@@ me that ten@@ s of thousands of people have par@@ tici@@ p@@ ated in , which is called C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A art ."
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
"I@@ mag@@ ine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A that you think is some@@ what p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar , like this C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A . ( T@@ ext : in@@ vi@@ sible to@@ a@@ ster ) Th@@ en what you &apos;re sup@@ posed to do is you take a scre@@ en sho@@ t of it ."
"Th@@ en of course , you f@@ ill out the C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A because you help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"But then , first you take a scre@@ en sho@@ t , and then you dra@@ w something that is rel@@ ated to it ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
There are ten@@ s of thousands of these .
S@@ ome of them are very c@@ ut@@ e . ( T@@ ext : cl@@ en@@ ched it ) ( Laughter ) S@@ ome of them are fun@@ ni@@ er .
"( T@@ ext : st@@ on@@ ed f@@ oun@@ d@@ ers ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like p@@ al@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ logical sh@@ vi@@ s@@ le , they con@@ tain S@@ no@@ op D@@ o@@ g@@ g . ( Laughter )"
"O@@ kay , so this is my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite number of re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
So this is the fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite thing that I like about this whole project .
"This is the number of dist@@ inc@@ t people that have hel@@ ped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze at least one word out of a book through re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A : 7@@ 50 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has hel@@ ped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human know@@ le@@ dge ."
And it is num@@ bers like these that mo@@ tiv@@ ate my research ag@@ end@@ a .
"So the question that mo@@ tiv@@ ates my research is the fol@@ lo@@ wing : If you look at hum@@ an@@ ity &apos;s lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ em@@ ents , these really big things that hum@@ an@@ ity has g@@ ot@@ ten together and done hi@@ stor@@ ically — like for example , building the p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds of E@@ g@@ yp@@ t or the P@@ an@@ am@@ a C@@ an@@ al or p@@ ut@@ ting a man on the M@@ o@@ on — there is a cur@@ i@@ ous fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people ."
"It &apos;s we@@ ird ; they were all done with about 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 people ."
"And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , co@@ ordin@@ ating more than 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 people , let al@@ one p@@ ay@@ ing them , was ess@@ enti@@ ally im@@ possible ."
"But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just sho@@ wn you a project where we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten 7@@ 50 million people to help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human know@@ le@@ dge ."
"So the question that mo@@ tiv@@ ates my research is , if we can put a man on the M@@ o@@ on with 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?"
"So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different pro@@ jects that we &apos;ve been working on ."
Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most exc@@ ited about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been se@@ mi@@ -@@ qui@@ e@@ tly working on for the last year and a half or so .
It ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t yet been la@@ un@@ ched . It &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"S@@ ince it ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t been la@@ un@@ ched , sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h !"
"( Laughter ) Yeah , I can tr@@ ust you &apos;ll do that ."
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
"It started with me pos@@ ing a question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent , S@@ e@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ ker ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s S@@ e@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ ker ."
So I posed the question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent .
"B@@ y the way , you did hear me cor@@ rec@@ tly ; his last name is H@@ ac@@ ker ."
So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free ?
"O@@ kay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b ."
So right now the W@@ e@@ b is par@@ ti@@ tion@@ ed into mul@@ ti@@ ple langu@@ ages .
A large fr@@ action of it is in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh .
"If you don &apos;t know any En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , you can &apos;t ac@@ cess it ."
"But there &apos;s large fr@@ ac@@ tions in other different langu@@ ages , and if you don &apos;t know those langu@@ ages , you can &apos;t ac@@ cess it ."
"So I would like to trans@@ l@@ ate all of the W@@ e@@ b , or at least most of the W@@ e@@ b , into every maj@@ or language ."
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
"Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use compu@@ ters to trans@@ l@@ ate ?"
Why can &apos;t we use machine trans@@ l@@ ation ?
M@@ ach@@ ine trans@@ l@@ ation no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays is star@@ ting to trans@@ l@@ ate some s@@ ent@@ ences here and there .
Why can &apos;t we use it to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b ?
Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
It makes a lot of m@@ ist@@ a@@ kes .
"E@@ ven when it doesn &apos;t make a m@@ ist@@ ake , since it makes so many m@@ ist@@ a@@ kes , you don &apos;t know whether to tr@@ ust it or not ."
So let me show you an example of something that was trans@@ l@@ ated with a machine .
A@@ c@@ tually it was a for@@ um p@@ ost .
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt .
It was trans@@ l@@ ated from J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese into En@@ g@@ li@@ sh .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
This person star@@ ts ap@@ o@@ logi@@ zing for the fact that it &apos;s trans@@ l@@ ated with a computer .
So the next s@@ ent@@ ence is is going to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to the question .
So he &apos;s just expl@@ ain@@ ing something .
"@@ Re@@ member , it &apos;s a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt ."
"( T@@ ext : A@@ t often , the go@@ at@@ -@@ time inst@@ all a er@@ ro@@ r is v@@ om@@ it . ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes the first part of the question ."
"( T@@ ext : How many times like the w@@ ind , a po@@ le , and the dra@@ g@@ on ? ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite part of the question ."
"( T@@ ext : This in@@ s@@ ult to father &apos;s st@@ ones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the en@@ ding , which is my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite part of the whole thing ."
"( T@@ ext : P@@ le@@ ase ap@@ o@@ logi@@ ze for your stu@@ p@@ id@@ ity . There are a many th@@ ank you . ) ( Laughter ) O@@ kay , so computer trans@@ l@@ ation , not yet good enough ."
So back to the question .
So we need people to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b .
"So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just p@@ ay people to do this ?"
We could p@@ ay prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al language trans@@ l@@ at@@ ors to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b .
We could do that .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it would be extre@@ me@@ ly exp@@ en@@ sive ."
"For example , trans@@ l@@ ating a tin@@ y , tin@@ y fr@@ action of the whole W@@ e@@ b , W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia , into one other language , S@@ p@@ an@@ ish ."
"W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia ex@@ i@@ sts in S@@ p@@ an@@ ish , but it &apos;s very small com@@ par@@ ed to the size of En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ."
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of En@@ g@@ li@@ sh .
"If we wanted to trans@@ l@@ ate the other 80 percent into S@@ p@@ an@@ ish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most exp@@ lo@@ ited , out@@ sour@@ c@@ ing country out there ."
So it would be very exp@@ en@@ sive .
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free .
"Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly real@@ ize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big h@@ ur@@ d@@ les , two big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les ."
The first one is a l@@ ack of b@@ il@@ in@@ gu@@ als .
So I don &apos;t even know if there ex@@ i@@ sts 100 million people out there using the W@@ e@@ b who are b@@ il@@ in@@ gu@@ al enough to help us trans@@ l@@ ate .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a l@@ ack of mo@@ tiv@@ ation .
How are we going to mo@@ tiv@@ ate people to actually trans@@ l@@ ate the W@@ e@@ b for free ?
"N@@ orm@@ ally , you have to p@@ ay people to do this ."
So how are we going to mo@@ tiv@@ ate them to do it for free ?
"Now when we were star@@ ting to think about this , we were b@@ loc@@ ked by these two things ."
"But then we real@@ ized , there &apos;s actually a way to sol@@ ve both these problems with the same sol@@ ution ."
There &apos;s a way to k@@ ill two b@@ ir@@ ds with one st@@ one .
"And that is to trans@@ form language trans@@ l@@ ation into something that m@@ illions of people want to do , and that also hel@@ ps with the problem of l@@ ack of b@@ il@@ in@@ gu@@ als , and that is language education ."
"So it turns out that today , there are over 1@@ .@@ 2 billion people learning a fore@@ ig@@ n language ."
"P@@ e@@ ople really , really want to learn a fore@@ ig@@ n language ."
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being for@@ c@@ ed to do so in school .
"For example , in the United States al@@ one , there are over five million people who have pa@@ id over $ 500 for so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to learn a new language ."
"So people really , really want to learn a new language ."
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new we@@ b@@ s@@ ite — it &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go — where the bas@@ ic idea is people learn a new language for free while sim@@ ul@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
"So the way this works is wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re a just a beg@@ in@@ ner , we give you very , very simple s@@ ent@@ ences ."
"There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple s@@ ent@@ ences on the W@@ e@@ b ."
"We give you very , very simple s@@ ent@@ ences along with what each word means ."
"And as you trans@@ l@@ ate them , and as you see how other people trans@@ l@@ ate them , you start learning the language ."
"And as you get more and more adv@@ anc@@ ed , we give you more and more comple@@ x s@@ ent@@ ences to trans@@ l@@ ate ."
"But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing ."
Now the cra@@ z@@ y thing about this me@@ th@@ od is that it actually really works .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , people are really , really learning a language ."
"We &apos;re m@@ os@@ tly done building it , and now we &apos;re te@@ st@@ ing it ."
P@@ e@@ ople really can learn a language with it .
And they learn it about as well as the lead@@ ing language learning so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
So people really do learn a language .
"And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting ."
"Because you see with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , people are actually learning with real cont@@ ent ."
"As op@@ posed to learning with ma@@ de@@ -@@ up s@@ ent@@ ences , people are learning with real cont@@ ent , which is in@@ her@@ ently interesting ."
So people really do learn a language .
"But perhaps more surpri@@ sing@@ ly , the trans@@ la@@ tions that we get from people using the s@@ ite , even though they &apos;re just beg@@ in@@ n@@ ers , the trans@@ la@@ tions that we get are as ac@@ cur@@ ate as those of prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al language trans@@ l@@ at@@ ors , which is very surpri@@ sing ."
So let me show you one example .
This is a s@@ ent@@ ence that was trans@@ l@@ ated from G@@ er@@ man into En@@ g@@ li@@ sh .
The top is the G@@ er@@ man .
The middle is an En@@ g@@ li@@ sh trans@@ l@@ ation that was done by somebody who was a prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al En@@ g@@ li@@ sh trans@@ l@@ ator who we pa@@ id 20 c@@ ents a word for this trans@@ l@@ ation .
"And the bot@@ to@@ m is a trans@@ l@@ ation by us@@ ers of D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , n@@ one of wh@@ om knew any G@@ er@@ man before they started using the s@@ ite ."
"You can see , it &apos;s pretty much per@@ f@@ ect ."
"Now of course , we play a tr@@ ick here to make the trans@@ la@@ tions as good as prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al language trans@@ l@@ at@@ ors ."
We com@@ b@@ ine the trans@@ la@@ tions of mul@@ ti@@ ple beg@@ in@@ n@@ ers to get the qu@@ ality of a single prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al trans@@ l@@ ator .
"Now even though we &apos;re com@@ b@@ ining the trans@@ la@@ tions , the s@@ ite actually can trans@@ l@@ ate pretty f@@ ast ."
"So let me show you , this is our es@@ tim@@ ates of how f@@ ast we could trans@@ l@@ ate W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia from En@@ g@@ li@@ sh into S@@ p@@ an@@ ish ."
"@@ Re@@ member , this is 50 million dol@@ lar@@ s@@ -@@ wor@@ th of val@@ ue ."
"So if we wanted to trans@@ l@@ ate W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia into S@@ p@@ an@@ ish , we could do it in five wee@@ ks with 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 ac@@ tive us@@ ers ."
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million ac@@ tive us@@ ers .
"S@@ ince all the pro@@ jects that my group has worked on so far have g@@ ot@@ ten m@@ illions of us@@ ers , we &apos;re hop@@ e@@ ful that we &apos;ll be able to trans@@ l@@ ate extre@@ me@@ ly f@@ ast with this project ."
Now the thing that I &apos;m most exc@@ ited about with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think this provi@@ des a fa@@ ir business model for language education .
"So here &apos;s the thing : The curr@@ ent business model for language education is the stud@@ ent p@@ ays , and in particular , the stud@@ ent p@@ ays R@@ os@@ et@@ t@@ a St@@ one 500 dollars ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the curr@@ ent business model .
The problem with this business model is that 9@@ 5 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
So it &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly un@@ fa@@ ir to@@ wards the po@@ or .
This is t@@ ot@@ ally bi@@ as@@ ed to@@ wards the r@@ ich .
"Now see , in D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , because while you learn you &apos;re actually cre@@ ating val@@ ue , you &apos;re trans@@ l@@ ating stuff — which for example , we could char@@ ge somebody for trans@@ la@@ tions ."
So this is how we could mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze this .
"S@@ ince people are cre@@ ating val@@ ue while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to p@@ ay their money , they p@@ ay with their time ."
"But the mag@@ ical thing here is that they &apos;re p@@ ay@@ ing with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been sp@@ ent any@@ ways learning the language ."
So the n@@ ice thing about D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think it provi@@ des a fa@@ ir business model — one that doesn &apos;t di@@ sc@@ ri@@ min@@ ate against po@@ or people .
So here &apos;s the s@@ ite . Thank you .
( Applause ) So here &apos;s the s@@ ite .
"We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet la@@ un@@ ched , but if you go there , you can sig@@ n up to be part of our pri@@ v@@ ate be@@ t@@ a , which is probably going to start in about three or four wee@@ ks ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet la@@ un@@ ched this D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"B@@ y the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is the work of a really aw@@ es@@ ome team , some of wh@@ om are here ."
So th@@ ank you .
( Applause )
"In O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , there was a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic doc@@ tor , who was very un@@ us@@ ual , nam@@ ed A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ war@@ t ."
"And A@@ li@@ ce was un@@ us@@ ual par@@ tly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty r@@ are in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s ."
"And she was br@@ illi@@ ant , she was one of the , at the time , the youn@@ g@@ est F@@ el@@ low to be elec@@ ted to the R@@ o@@ y@@ al C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge of P@@ h@@ ys@@ ici@@ ans ."
"S@@ he was un@@ us@@ ual too because she contin@@ u@@ ed to work after she got mar@@ ri@@ ed , after she had kids , and even after she got di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed and was a single par@@ ent , she contin@@ u@@ ed her me@@ d@@ ical work ."
"And she was un@@ us@@ ual because she was really interest@@ ed in a new science , the em@@ er@@ g@@ ing fiel@@ d of ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ o@@ logy , the study of pat@@ ter@@ ns in disease ."
"But like every scienti@@ st , she ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated that to make her mar@@ k , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and sol@@ ve it ."
The hard problem that A@@ li@@ ce ch@@ ose was the ri@@ sing in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence of chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood c@@ anc@@ ers .
"M@@ ost disease is cor@@ rel@@ ated with po@@ ver@@ ty , but in the case of chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood c@@ anc@@ ers , the children who were d@@ ying se@@ em@@ ed m@@ os@@ tly to come from aff@@ l@@ u@@ ent famili@@ es ."
"So , what , she wanted to know , could expl@@ ain this an@@ om@@ al@@ y ?"
"Now , A@@ li@@ ce had tr@@ ou@@ ble getting fund@@ ing for her research ."
"In the end , she got just 1@@ ,000 p@@ ounds from the L@@ ad@@ y T@@ at@@ a M@@ em@@ ori@@ al pri@@ ze ."
And that me@@ ant she knew she only had one sho@@ t at coll@@ ec@@ ting her data .
"Now , she had no idea what to look for ."
"This really was a nee@@ dle in a ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack sort of sear@@ ch , so she asked everything she could think of ."
H@@ ad the children e@@ at@@ en bo@@ il@@ ed s@@ wee@@ ts ?
H@@ ad they con@@ sum@@ ed co@@ lo@@ red dr@@ in@@ ks ?
D@@ id they e@@ at fish and ch@@ i@@ ps ?
D@@ id they have in@@ do@@ or or out@@ do@@ or pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
"And when her car@@ b@@ on cop@@ i@@ ed ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire started to come back , one thing and one thing only j@@ um@@ ped out with the sta@@ tis@@ tical cl@@ ar@@ ity of a kind that most scienti@@ sts can only dre@@ am of ."
"B@@ y a r@@ ate of two to one , the children who had died had had mo@@ thers who had been X@@ -@@ ra@@ y@@ ed when pre@@ gn@@ ant ."
Now that fin@@ ding f@@ le@@ w in the face of con@@ ven@@ tional w@@ is@@ dom .
"C@@ on@@ ven@@ tional w@@ is@@ dom hel@@ d that everything was sa@@ fe up to a point , a thre@@ sho@@ ld ."
"It f@@ le@@ w in the face of con@@ ven@@ tional w@@ is@@ dom , which was huge en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ as@@ m for the c@@ ool new technology of that age , which was the X@@ -@@ r@@ ay machine ."
"And it f@@ le@@ w in the face of doc@@ tors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who hel@@ ped patients , they didn &apos;t har@@ m them ."
"N@@ e@@ ver@@ the@@ less , A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ war@@ t r@@ us@@ h@@ ed to publi@@ sh her pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary fin@@ d@@ ings in The L@@ anc@@ et in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"P@@ e@@ ople got very exc@@ ited , there was talk of the N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze , and A@@ li@@ ce really was in a big h@@ ur@@ ry to try to study all the c@@ ases of chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood cancer she could find before they dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed ."
"In fact , she need not have h@@ ur@@ ri@@ ed ."
It was fully 25 years before the B@@ ri@@ tis@@ h and me@@ d@@ ical — B@@ ri@@ tis@@ h and American me@@ d@@ ical est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ments ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed the pr@@ ac@@ tice of X@@ -@@ ra@@ ying pre@@ gn@@ ant women .
"The data was out there , it was open , it was fre@@ ely av@@ a@@ il@@ able , but no@@ body wanted to know ."
"A child a week was d@@ ying , but nothing changed ."
O@@ p@@ en@@ ness al@@ one can &apos;t dri@@ ve change .
So for 25 years A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ war@@ t had a very big fi@@ ght on her h@@ ands .
"So , how did she know that she was right ?"
"Well , she had a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic model for thinking ."
"S@@ he worked with a sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ an nam@@ ed G@@ e@@ or@@ ge K@@ ne@@ ale , and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge was pretty much everything that A@@ li@@ ce wasn &apos;t ."
"So , A@@ li@@ ce was very out@@ going and soci@@ able , and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge was a re@@ cl@@ use ."
"A@@ li@@ ce was very war@@ m , very em@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with her patients ."
G@@ e@@ or@@ ge fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly pre@@ fer@@ red num@@ bers to people .
But he said this f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic thing about their working relation@@ ship .
"He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to pro@@ ve D@@ r@@ . S@@ te@@ war@@ t wrong . &quot; &quot; He ac@@ tively s@@ ou@@ ght dis@@ con@@ fir@@ mation ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent ways of looking at her mo@@ d@@ els , at her sta@@ tis@@ tics , different ways of cr@@ un@@ ching the data in order to dis@@ pro@@ ve her ."
He saw his job as cre@@ ating conf@@ lic@@ t around her the@@ or@@ ies .
"Because it was only by not being able to pro@@ ve that she was wrong , that G@@ e@@ or@@ ge could give A@@ li@@ ce the con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence she needed to know that she was right ."
It &apos;s a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic model of coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation — thinking par@@ t@@ n@@ ers who ar@@ en &apos;t ech@@ o cha@@ m@@ bers .
"I won@@ der how many of us have , or d@@ are to have , such coll@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ors ."
A@@ li@@ ce and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge were very good at conf@@ lic@@ t .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of con@@ struc@@ tive conf@@ lic@@ t re@@ qu@@ ire ?
"Well , first of all , it re@@ qui@@ res that we find people who are very different from ourselves ."
"That means we have to resi@@ st the ne@@ u@@ ro@@ bio@@ logical dri@@ ve , which means that we really pre@@ f@@ er people m@@ os@@ tly like ourselves , and it means we have to see@@ k out people with different bac@@ k@@ gr@@ ounds , different dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to eng@@ age with them ."
That re@@ qui@@ res a lot of pati@@ ence and a lot of energy .
"And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love ."
Because you sim@@ ply won &apos;t comm@@ it that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
And it also means that we have to be pre@@ par@@ ed to change our min@@ ds .
"A@@ li@@ ce &apos;s d@@ aughter told me that every time A@@ li@@ ce went he@@ ad@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ head with a fel@@ low scienti@@ st , they made her think and think and think again ."
"&quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y a fi@@ ght , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one relation@@ ship ."
"But it stri@@ kes me that the bi@@ gg@@ est problems we face , many of the bi@@ gg@@ est di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers that we &apos;ve experi@@ enc@@ ed , m@@ os@@ tly ha@@ ven &apos;t come from individu@@ als , they &apos;ve come from organ@@ iz@@ ations , some of them bi@@ g@@ ger than countries , many of them cap@@ able of aff@@ ec@@ ting hund@@ re@@ ds , thousands , even m@@ illions of lives ."
So how do organ@@ iz@@ ations think ?
"Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t ."
"And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t ."
And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too af@@ ra@@ id of conf@@ lic@@ t .
"In sur@@ ve@@ ys of Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an and American ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ti@@ ves , fully 8@@ 5 percent of them ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ed that they had issu@@ es or con@@ cer@@ ns at work that they were af@@ ra@@ id to ra@@ ise ."
"A@@ fra@@ id of the conf@@ lic@@ t that that would pro@@ vo@@ ke , af@@ ra@@ id to get em@@ bro@@ il@@ ed in ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents that they did not know how to man@@ age , and felt that they were b@@ ound to l@@ ose ."
E@@ igh@@ t@@ y-@@ five percent is a really big number .
It means that organ@@ iz@@ ations m@@ os@@ tly can &apos;t do what G@@ e@@ or@@ ge and A@@ li@@ ce so tri@@ um@@ ph@@ an@@ tly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
"And it means that people like many of us , who have run organ@@ iz@@ ations , and g@@ one out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , m@@ os@@ tly fa@@ il to get the best out of them ."
So how do we devel@@ op the sk@@ ill@@ s that we need ?
"Because it does take sk@@ ill and pr@@ ac@@ tice , too ."
"If we ar@@ en &apos;t going to be af@@ ra@@ id of conf@@ lic@@ t , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it ."
"So , rec@@ ently , I worked with an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive nam@@ ed J@@ o@@ e , and J@@ o@@ e worked for a me@@ d@@ ical dev@@ ice company ."
And J@@ o@@ e was very wor@@ ri@@ ed about the dev@@ ice that he was working on .
He thought that it was too comp@@ lic@@ ated and he thought that its comple@@ x@@ ity created mar@@ g@@ ins of er@@ ro@@ r that could really h@@ ur@@ t people .
He was af@@ ra@@ id of doing d@@ ama@@ ge to the patients he was trying to help .
"But when he looked around his organ@@ ization , no@@ body else se@@ em@@ ed to be at all wor@@ ri@@ ed ."
"So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t ."
M@@ ay@@ be he &apos;d look stu@@ p@@ id .
"But he ke@@ pt wor@@ r@@ ying about it , and he wor@@ ri@@ ed about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he lo@@ ved ."
"In the end , J@@ o@@ e and I found a way for him to ra@@ ise his con@@ cer@@ ns ."
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this sit@@ u@@ ation .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts .
So now J@@ o@@ e had al@@ li@@ es . They could think together .
"And y@@ es , there was a lot of conf@@ lic@@ t and de@@ b@@ ate and ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent , but that allo@@ wed everyone around the table to be cre@@ ative , to sol@@ ve the problem , and to change the dev@@ ice ."
"@@ J@@ o@@ e was what a lot of people might think of as a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ -@@ b@@ lo@@ wer , ex@@ cept that like almost all wh@@ ist@@ le@@ -@@ b@@ lo@@ w@@ ers , he wasn &apos;t a cr@@ ank at all , he was p@@ as@@ sion@@ ately dev@@ ot@@ ed to the organ@@ ization and the high@@ er pur@@ pos@@ es that that organ@@ ization ser@@ ved ."
"But he had been so af@@ ra@@ id of conf@@ lic@@ t , until finally he became more af@@ ra@@ id of the sil@@ ence ."
"And when he dar@@ ed to spe@@ ak , he disco@@ vered much more inside h@@ im@@ self and much more give in the system than he had ever imag@@ ined ."
And his col@@ le@@ ag@@ ues don &apos;t think of him as a cr@@ ank .
They think of him as a lead@@ er .
"So , how do we have these conver@@ sa@@ tions more eas@@ ily and more often ?"
"Well , the U@@ ni@@ versity of D@@ el@@ ft re@@ qui@@ res that its P@@ h@@ D students have to sub@@ m@@ it five st@@ at@@ em@@ ents that they &apos;re pre@@ par@@ ed to de@@ f@@ end ."
"It doesn &apos;t really matter what the st@@ at@@ em@@ ents are about , what mat@@ ters is that the can@@ di@@ d@@ ates are w@@ ill@@ ing and able to st@@ and up to au@@ th@@ or@@ ity ."
"I think it &apos;s a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic system , but I think le@@ a@@ ving it to P@@ h@@ D can@@ di@@ d@@ ates is far too few people , and way too l@@ ate in life ."
"I think we need to be te@@ ach@@ ing these sk@@ ill@@ s to kids and ad@@ ul@@ ts at every st@@ age of their develop@@ ment , if we want to have thinking organ@@ iz@@ ations and a thinking society ."
The fact is that most of the bi@@ gg@@ est c@@ at@@ ast@@ ro@@ ph@@ es that we &apos;ve w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed r@@ ar@@ ely come from information that is sec@@ re@@ t or hi@@ dd@@ en .
"It comes from information that is fre@@ ely av@@ a@@ il@@ able and out there , but that we are w@@ ill@@ fully bl@@ ind to , because we can &apos;t h@@ and@@ le , don &apos;t want to h@@ and@@ le , the conf@@ lic@@ t that it pro@@ vo@@ kes ."
"But when we d@@ are to bre@@ ak that sil@@ ence , or when we d@@ are to see , and we create conf@@ lic@@ t , we en@@ able ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking ."
"O@@ p@@ en information is f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic , open net@@ works are ess@@ ential ."
But the tru@@ th won &apos;t set us free until we devel@@ op the sk@@ ill@@ s and the ha@@ bit and the tal@@ ent and the mor@@ al cou@@ ra@@ ge to use it .
O@@ p@@ en@@ ness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .

"M@@ y En@@ g@@ li@@ sh l@@ ost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by so many a@@ z@@ un@@ g@@ u , wh@@ ite people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I w@@ ouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m fe@@ eling good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have se@@ ven children in my family .
"A@@ ll si@@ st@@ ers , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my d@@ ad when I was a little bo@@ y .
"B@@ e@@ fore I disco@@ vered the won@@ d@@ ers of science , I was just a simple far@@ m@@ er in a country of po@@ or far@@ m@@ ers ."
"L@@ i@@ ke everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ ize ."
One year our for@@ tun@@ e turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we experi@@ enc@@ ed an aw@@ ful fam@@ ine .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five months all M@@ al@@ a@@ wi@@ ans beg@@ an to star@@ ve to de@@ ath .
"M@@ y family ate one me@@ al per day , at night ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ sim@@ a for each one of us .
The food p@@ ass@@ es through our bo@@ dies .
We dro@@ p down to nothing .
"In M@@ al@@ aw@@ i , the secon@@ d@@ ary school , you have to p@@ ay school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the h@@ un@@ ger , I was for@@ c@@ ed to dro@@ p out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I felt very happy to be at the secon@@ d@@ ary school , so I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to re@@ ce@@ ive education ."
So I went to a li@@ br@@ ary .
"I read bo@@ o@@ ks , science bo@@ o@@ ks , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally phys@@ ics ."
I couldn &apos;t read En@@ g@@ li@@ sh that well .
I used di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that know@@ le@@ dge in my h@@ ands .
It said a win@@ d@@ m@@ ill could p@@ um@@ p water and gener@@ ate electr@@ ic@@ ity .
"P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , a de@@ f@@ en@@ se against h@@ un@@ ger , which we were experi@@ enc@@ ing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one win@@ d@@ m@@ ill for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a sc@@ ra@@ p y@@ ard where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , inclu@@ ding my mother , said I was cra@@ z@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) I found a trac@@ tor f@@ an , sho@@ c@@ k ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ p@@ es ."
"@@ U@@ sing a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle fra@@ me and an old b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle d@@ y@@ nam@@ o , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four li@@ ghts , with s@@ w@@ it@@ ch@@ es , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it brea@@ ker , mo@@ d@@ el@@ ed after an elec@@ tri@@ c b@@ ell ."
A@@ no@@ ther machine p@@ um@@ ps water for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .
Q@@ u@@ e@@ ues of people start l@@ ining up at my house ( Laughter ) to char@@ ge their mo@@ bi@@ le phone .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the re@@ por@@ ters came too , which le@@ ad to b@@ log@@ g@@ ers and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an air@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ le@@ pt in a h@@ ot@@ el .
"So , on st@@ age that day in Ar@@ us@@ h@@ a , my En@@ g@@ li@@ sh l@@ ost , I said something like , &quot; I tri@@ ed . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Afr@@ ic@@ ans , and the po@@ or who are str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with your dre@@ am@@ s ."
G@@ od bl@@ ess .
M@@ ay@@ be one day you will wat@@ ch this on the Internet .
"I say to you , tr@@ ust y@@ our@@ self and believe ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever happens , don &apos;t give up ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"In the 19@@ 8@@ 0s in the commun@@ ist E@@ ast@@ er@@ n G@@ er@@ many , if you o@@ w@@ ned a t@@ y@@ pe@@ writ@@ er , you had to re@@ gi@@ ster it with the government ."
You had to re@@ gi@@ ster a sa@@ m@@ ple sh@@ e@@ et of t@@ ext out of the t@@ y@@ pe@@ writ@@ er .
And this was done so the government could tr@@ ack where t@@ ext was coming from .
"If they found a p@@ aper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could tr@@ ack down who created that thought ."
"And we in the W@@ est couldn &apos;t understand how any@@ body could do this , how much this would re@@ str@@ ic@@ t fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ ec@@ h ."
We would never do that in our own countries .
"But today in 20@@ 11 , if you go and bu@@ y a col@@ or l@@ as@@ er prin@@ ter from any maj@@ or l@@ as@@ er prin@@ ter man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ re@@ r and pr@@ int a p@@ age , that p@@ age will end up having s@@ light y@@ el@@ low d@@ ots prin@@ ted on every single p@@ age in a pat@@ ter@@ n which makes the p@@ age uni@@ qu@@ e to you and to your prin@@ ter ."
This is happening to us today .
And no@@ body se@@ ems to be making a f@@ us@@ s about it .
"And this is an example of the ways that our own govern@@ ments are using technology against us , the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ."
And this is one of the ma@@ in three sour@@ ces of on@@ line problems today .
"If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the on@@ line world , we can group the att@@ ac@@ ks based on the att@@ ac@@ kers ."
We have three ma@@ in grou@@ ps .
We have on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als .
"L@@ i@@ ke here , we have M@@ r@@ . D@@ im@@ it@@ ry G@@ ol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of K@@ i@@ e@@ v in U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine ."
And the mo@@ ti@@ ves of on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
"They use on@@ line att@@ ac@@ ks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it ."
"We actually have se@@ ver@@ al c@@ ases of m@@ illi@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ res on@@ line , mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ res , who made money with their att@@ ac@@ ks ."
Here &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir T@@ sa@@ st@@ s@@ in form T@@ ar@@ t@@ u in E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z .
This is S@@ te@@ ph@@ en W@@ at@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ und@@ in .
"This is M@@ at@@ the@@ w An@@ der@@ son , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ D@@ a@@ our and so on and so on ."
"Th@@ ese guys make their for@@ tun@@ es on@@ line , but they make it through the il@@ le@@ g@@ al means of using things like ban@@ king t@@ ro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts while we do on@@ line ban@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ log@@ g@@ ers to coll@@ ect our cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard information while we are doing on@@ line sh@@ op@@ ping from an in@@ f@@ ected computer ."
"The U.@@ S. S@@ ec@@ re@@ t S@@ er@@ v@@ ice , two months ago , f@@ ro@@ ze the S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t of M@@ r@@ . S@@ am J@@ ain right here , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.@@ S. dollars on it when it was f@@ ro@@ z@@ en ."
M@@ r@@ . J@@ ain h@@ im@@ self is on the lo@@ ose ; no@@ body kno@@ ws where he is .
And I cl@@ a@@ i@@ m it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more li@@ ke@@ ly for any of us to become the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of a cri@@ me on@@ line than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvi@@ ous that this is only going to get wor@@ se .
"In the future , the maj@@ or@@ ity of cri@@ me will be happening on@@ line ."
The second maj@@ or group of att@@ ac@@ kers that we are wat@@ ching today are not mo@@ tiv@@ ated by money .
"They &apos;re mo@@ tiv@@ ated by something else — mo@@ tiv@@ ated by prot@@ est@@ s , mo@@ tiv@@ ated by an op@@ in@@ ion , mo@@ tiv@@ ated by the l@@ augh@@ s ."
G@@ rou@@ ps like An@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a maj@@ or play@@ er in the fiel@@ d of on@@ line att@@ ac@@ ks .
"So those are the three ma@@ in att@@ ac@@ kers : cri@@ min@@ als who do it for the money , h@@ ac@@ k@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like An@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous doing it for the prot@@ est , but then the last group are n@@ ation st@@ ates , govern@@ ments doing the att@@ ac@@ ks ."
And then we look at c@@ ases like what happened in D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a pri@@ me example of what happens when govern@@ ments att@@ ack against their own ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens .
"D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate Au@@ th@@ or@@ ity from The N@@ e@@ ther@@ l@@ ands — or actually , it was ."
It was run@@ ning into ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ c@@ y last f@@ all because they were h@@ ac@@ ked into .
S@@ ome@@ body bro@@ ke in and they h@@ ac@@ ked it th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly .
"And I asked last week in a me@@ e@@ ting with D@@ ut@@ ch government re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves , I asked one of the lead@@ ers of the team whether he found pl@@ a@@ us@@ i@@ ble that people died because of the D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar h@@ ack ."
And his answer was y@@ es .
So how do people di@@ e as the res@@ ult of a h@@ ack like this ?
Well D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .@@ A@@ .
They s@@ ell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
"Well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite that has h@@ t@@ t@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted serv@@ ices , serv@@ ices like G@@ ma@@ il ."
"Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ ma@@ il or one of their com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tors , but these serv@@ ices are es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally pop@@ ular in t@@ ot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an st@@ ates like I@@ r@@ an , where dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents use fore@@ ig@@ n serv@@ ices like G@@ ma@@ il because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local serv@@ ices and they are enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L connec@@ tions , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions ."
E@@ x@@ cept they can if they h@@ ack into a fore@@ ig@@ n C@@ .@@ A@@ .
and issu@@ e ro@@ gu@@ e cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
"What about A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t ?"
"Well in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of the E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ an sec@@ re@@ t poli@@ ce in Ap@@ ri@@ l 20@@ 11 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of p@@ ap@@ ers ."
"A@@ m@@ ong those p@@ ap@@ ers , was this b@@ in@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And within that b@@ in@@ der were n@@ ot@@ es from a company based in G@@ er@@ many which had so@@ ld the E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government a set of to@@ ols for inter@@ cep@@ ting — and in very large scale — all the communic@@ ation of the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens of the country ."
"They had so@@ ld this to@@ o@@ l for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 Eu@@ ro@@ s to the E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government ."
The company he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters are right here .
So W@@ est@@ er@@ n govern@@ ments are provi@@ ding t@@ ot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an govern@@ ments with to@@ ols to do this against their own ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens .
But W@@ est@@ er@@ n govern@@ ments are doing it to themselves as well .
"For example , in G@@ er@@ many , just a couple of wee@@ ks ago the so@@ -@@ called St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a t@@ ro@@ j@@ an used by G@@ er@@ man government off@@ ici@@ als to inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate their own ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ."
"If you are a s@@ us@@ p@@ ect in a cri@@ min@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous , your phone will be t@@ app@@ ed ."
"But today , it goes be@@ y@@ on@@ d that ."
They will ta@@ p your Internet connec@@ tion .
"They will even use to@@ ols like St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an to in@@ f@@ ect your computer with a t@@ ro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ab@@ les them to wat@@ ch all your communic@@ ation , to list@@ en to your on@@ line di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions , to coll@@ ect your p@@ ass@@ words ."
"Now when we think de@@ ep@@ er about things like these , the obvi@@ ous respon@@ se from people should be that , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , that s@@ ounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really aff@@ ect me because I &apos;m a le@@ g@@ al ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ."
Why should I wor@@ ry ?
"Because I have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot; &quot; And this is an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent , which doesn &apos;t make sense ."
P@@ ri@@ v@@ acy is imp@@ li@@ ed .
P@@ ri@@ v@@ acy is not up for di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion .
This is not a question between pri@@ v@@ acy against sec@@ ur@@ ity .
It &apos;s a question of fre@@ e@@ dom against control .
"And while we might tr@@ ust our govern@@ ments right now , right here in 20@@ 11 , any right we give away will be given away for good ."
"And do we tr@@ ust , do we bl@@ in@@ d@@ ly tr@@ ust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?"
And these are the questions that we have to wor@@ ry about for the next 50 years .
We re@@ tain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying m@@ und@@ an@@ e s@@ ounds .
"This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble dr@@ y@@ er ."
"Now sound is my p@@ as@@ sion , it &apos;s my life ."
( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause ) ( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to spe@@ ak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ ues .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally underst@@ ood that questions of mor@@ ality — questions of good and e@@ vi@@ l and right and wrong — are questions about which science off@@ ici@@ ally has no op@@ in@@ ion ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we val@@ ue , but it can never tell us what we ou@@ ght to val@@ ue ."
"And , con@@ sequ@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ stitu@@ t@@ es a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to ar@@ gu@@ e that this is an ill@@ us@@ ion — that the se@@ par@@ ation between science and human val@@ ues is an ill@@ us@@ ion — and actually quite a d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s often said that science can@@ not give us a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ ues see@@ m to b@@ el@@ ong to different sp@@ her@@ es ."
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ou@@ ght to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ ues are a cer@@ tain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ at@@ u@@ res .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ th@@ ical ob@@ lig@@ ations to@@ ward ro@@ c@@ ks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel comp@@ as@@ sion for ro@@ c@@ ks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ c@@ ks can su@@ ff@@ er . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our fel@@ low pri@@ mat@@ es than we are about in@@ sec@@ ts , as in@@ de@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ posed to a gre@@ ater ran@@ ge of pot@@ ential happ@@ iness and su@@ ff@@ ering ."
"Now , the cr@@ uc@@ i@@ al thing to no@@ tice here is that this is a fac@@ tual cl@@ a@@ i@@ m : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed the relation@@ ship between bio@@ logical comple@@ x@@ ity and the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ sec@@ ts ."
"And there &apos;s no no@@ tion , no ver@@ sion of human mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ duc@@ i@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about con@@ sci@@ ous experience and its possible chang@@ es ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ ues from reli@@ gi@@ on , even if you think that good and e@@ vi@@ l ul@@ tim@@ ately rel@@ ate to con@@ di@@ tions after de@@ ath — ei@@ ther to an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of happ@@ iness with G@@ od or an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of su@@ ff@@ ering in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness and its chang@@ es ."
"And to say that such chang@@ es can per@@ si@@ st after de@@ ath is itself a fac@@ tual cl@@ a@@ i@@ m , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to spe@@ ak about the con@@ di@@ tions of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a contin@@ u@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fa@@ il@@ ed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mo@@ thers can@@ not fe@@ ed their children , where str@@ ang@@ ers can@@ not find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ace@@ ful coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation , where people are m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in@@ di@@ sc@@ ri@@ min@@ ately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this contin@@ u@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more id@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a conf@@ er@@ ence like this is even con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a to the water be a good idea ?
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the e@@ vi@@ l ey@@ e , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ ately b@@ la@@ me their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors ? P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human comm@@ uni@@ ties fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And mor@@ ality rel@@ ates to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ ues we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our sit@@ u@@ ation in the world can be underst@@ ood at many lev@@ els — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic systems and poli@@ tical ar@@ r@@ ang@@ em@@ ents ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being we are , of nec@@ ess@@ ity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is real@@ ized in the brain — what@@ ever happens after de@@ ath .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ ici@@ de b@@ om@@ ber does get 7@@ 2 vir@@ g@@ ins in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his person@@ ality — his rather un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate person@@ ality — is the produc@@ t of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions of culture — if culture chang@@ es us , as in@@ de@@ ed it does , it chang@@ es us by chang@@ ing our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ e@@ fore what@@ ever cul@@ tur@@ al vari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h can , at least in prin@@ ci@@ ple , be underst@@ ood in the cont@@ ext of a mat@@ uring science of the mind — neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logy , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m ar@@ gu@@ ing is that val@@ ue &apos;s re@@ duc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the con@@ sci@@ ous experience of con@@ sci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can ther@@ e@@ fore vi@@ su@@ al@@ ize a space of possible chang@@ es in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a mor@@ al l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape , with pe@@ a@@ ks and val@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ respon@@ d to differ@@ ences in the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ at@@ u@@ res , both person@@ al and coll@@ ec@@ tive ."
"And one thing to no@@ tice is that perhaps there are st@@ ates of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being that we r@@ ar@@ ely ac@@ cess , that few people ac@@ cess ."
And these a@@ wa@@ it our disco@@ very .
P@@ er@@ haps some of these st@@ ates can be appro@@ pri@@ ately called m@@ ys@@ tical or sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual .
P@@ er@@ haps there are other st@@ ates that we can &apos;t ac@@ cess because of how our min@@ ds are struc@@ tu@@ red but other min@@ ds possi@@ bly could ac@@ cess them .
"Now , let me be cle@@ ar about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to ma@@ p this space , or that we will have scienti@@ fic ans@@ w@@ ers to every con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ able mor@@ al question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for inst@@ ance , that you will one day con@@ s@@ ult a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should b@@ om@@ b I@@ r@@ an &apos;s n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar fac@@ ili@@ ties , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the full cost of TED as a business exp@@ en@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions aff@@ ect human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being then they do have ans@@ w@@ ers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting this — just ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to the question of how hum@@ ans fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h — will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For inst@@ ance , there are 2@@ 1 st@@ ates in our country where cor@@ por@@ al p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment in the cl@@ ass@@ room is le@@ g@@ al , where it is le@@ g@@ al for a te@@ ac@@ her to be@@ at a child with a w@@ oo@@ d@@ en bo@@ ard , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing large b@@ ru@@ is@@ es and b@@ list@@ ers and even brea@@ king the sk@@ in ."
"And hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of children , in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , are sub@@ jec@@ ted to this every year ."
"The loc@@ ations of these en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed di@@ str@@ ic@@ ts , I think , will fa@@ il to surpri@@ se you ."
We &apos;re not talking about Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut .
And the ra@@ tion@@ ale for this behavi@@ or is exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly reli@@ gi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ ator of the universe h@@ im@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , l@@ est we sp@@ oil the child — this is in P@@ ro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the obvi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally spe@@ a@@ king , to sub@@ ject children to pa@@ in and viol@@ ence and public hum@@ ili@@ ation as a way of enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing heal@@ thy emo@@ tional develop@@ ment and good behavi@@ or ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the no@@ tion of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being is tru@@ ly un@@ de@@ fin@@ ed , and se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly per@@ pe@@ tually open to be re@@ -@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed ."
"And so , how ther@@ e@@ fore can there be an ob@@ jec@@ tive no@@ tion of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ?"
"Well , consi@@ der by an@@ al@@ o@@ gy , the con@@ cept of phys@@ ical health ."
The con@@ cept of phys@@ ical health is un@@ de@@ fin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el S@@ p@@ ec@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
Wh@@ en this st@@ at@@ ue was car@@ ved the a@@ ver@@ age life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the develop@@ ed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ dd@@ le with our gen@@ omes in such a way that not being able to run a mar@@ a@@ th@@ on at age 2@@ 00 will be consi@@ der@@ ed a pro@@ found dis@@ ability .
P@@ e@@ ople will s@@ end you d@@ on@@ ations when you &apos;re in that con@@ di@@ tion .
"( Laughter ) N@@ o@@ tice that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is open , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely open for re@@ vi@@ sion , does not make it v@@ ac@@ u@@ ous ."
The dist@@ inc@@ tion between a heal@@ thy person and a de@@ ad one is about as cle@@ ar and con@@ sequ@@ ential as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to no@@ tice is there may be many pe@@ a@@ ks on the mor@@ al l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape : There may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to organ@@ ize a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing .
"Now , why w@@ ouldn &apos;t this under@@ m@@ ine an ob@@ jec@@ tive mor@@ ality ?"
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be t@@ emp@@ ted to ar@@ gu@@ e to you that there must be one right food to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a ran@@ ge of materi@@ als that con@@ stitu@@ te heal@@ thy food .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less a cle@@ ar dist@@ inc@@ tion between food and po@@ is@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ w@@ ers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not t@@ emp@@ t us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a uni@@ vers@@ al mor@@ ality would re@@ qu@@ ire mor@@ al pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ m@@ it of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for inst@@ ance , if it &apos;s really wrong to li@@ e , it must always be wrong to li@@ e , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as mor@@ al tru@@ th ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , by an@@ al@@ o@@ gy , the g@@ ame of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to play good ch@@ ess , a prin@@ ci@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t l@@ ose your Q@@ u@@ een , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mom@@ ents when l@@ os@@ ing your Q@@ u@@ een is a br@@ illi@@ ant thing to do .
There are mom@@ ents when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a d@@ om@@ ain of per@@ f@@ ect ob@@ jec@@ tivity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this br@@ ings us to the sor@@ ts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the mor@@ al sp@@ here ."
Con@@ si@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ dies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can co@@ ver them up .
"Now , it is the posi@@ tion , gener@@ ally spe@@ a@@ king , of our int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ os@@ ton or P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , who are we to say that the p@@ rou@@ d d@@ en@@ iz@@ ens of an anci@@ ent culture are wrong to for@@ ce their wi@@ ves and d@@ augh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with l@@ eng@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or th@@ row b@@ at@@ ter@@ y ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they dec@@ line the pri@@ v@@ il@@ e@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pret@@ end that we know so little about human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being that we have to be non@@ -@@ ju@@ d@@ g@@ m@@ ental about a pr@@ ac@@ tice like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary w@@ ear@@ ing of a ve@@ il — women should be able to we@@ ar what@@ ever they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary mean in a community where , when a girl gets r@@ ap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first imp@@ ul@@ se , rather often , is to m@@ ur@@ der her out of s@@ ha@@ me ?"
"@@ J@@ ust let that fact de@@ t@@ on@@ ate in your brain for a minut@@ e : Y@@ our d@@ aughter gets r@@ ap@@ ed , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ pres@@ ents a pe@@ ak of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the per@@ f@@ ect sol@@ ution in our own society ."
"For inst@@ ance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ st@@ and almost any@@ where in the civi@@ li@@ z@@ ed world ."
"Now , gr@@ an@@ ted , for many men it may re@@ qu@@ ire a de@@ gre@@ e in ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y to see something wrong with these imag@@ es ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the per@@ f@@ ect ex@@ pres@@ sion of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical b@@ al@@ ance with resp@@ ect to vari@@ ab@@ les like y@@ outh and beau@@ ty and women &apos;s bo@@ dies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ tim@@ al environment in which to ra@@ ise our children ?"
"P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spec@@ tr@@ um between these two extre@@ m@@ es that re@@ pres@@ ents a place of better b@@ al@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ haps there are many such places — again , given other chang@@ es in human culture there may be many pe@@ a@@ ks on the mor@@ al l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape ."
But the thing to no@@ tice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ ak .
"Now the ir@@ on@@ y , from my per@@ spec@@ tive , is that the only people who see@@ m to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to mor@@ al questions are reli@@ gi@@ ous de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ w@@ ers to mor@@ al questions because they got these ans@@ w@@ ers from a vo@@ ice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ w@@ ind , not because they made an int@@ ellig@@ ent an@@ al@@ ys@@ is of the ca@@ uses and con@@ di@@ tion of human and anim@@ al w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ."
"In fact , the end@@ ur@@ ance of reli@@ gi@@ on as a l@@ ens through which most people view mor@@ al questions has se@@ par@@ ated most mor@@ al talk from real questions of human and anim@@ al su@@ ff@@ ering ."
This is why we sp@@ end our time talking about things like g@@ ay mar@@ ri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or po@@ ver@@ ty or any other hu@@ ge@@ ly con@@ sequ@@ ential issu@@ e .
But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : We need a uni@@ vers@@ al con@@ cep@@ tion of human val@@ ues .
"Now , what st@@ ands in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to no@@ tice is that we do something different when talking about mor@@ ality — es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally sec@@ ular , ac@@ a@@ de@@ m@@ ic , scienti@@ st typ@@ es ."
Wh@@ en talking about mor@@ ality we val@@ ue differ@@ ences of op@@ in@@ ion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
"So , for inst@@ ance the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ am@@ a gets up every mor@@ ning me@@ d@@ it@@ ating on comp@@ as@@ sion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ ping other human be@@ ings is an in@@ te@@ gr@@ al comp@@ on@@ ent of human happ@@ iness ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y ; T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y was very f@@ on@@ d of ab@@ duc@@ ting and r@@ ap@@ ing and t@@ or@@ tur@@ ing and kill@@ ing young women ."
"So , we appe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ in@@ ion about how to prof@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ ost W@@ est@@ er@@ n int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ als look at this sit@@ u@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ am@@ a to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent that pot@@ enti@@ ally f@@ all@@ s within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He li@@ kes cho@@ col@@ ate , he li@@ kes v@@ an@@ ill@@ a ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the other . &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ tice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a str@@ ing the@@ or@@ ist .
"If you ask the s@@ mar@@ test phys@@ ici@@ sts around who is the s@@ mar@@ test phys@@ ic@@ ist around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I sho@@ wed up at a phys@@ ics conf@@ er@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing the@@ ory is bo@@ g@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t res@@ on@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small scale .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a phys@@ ic@@ ist ; I don &apos;t understand str@@ ing the@@ ory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y of str@@ ing the@@ ory .
( Laughter ) I w@@ ouldn &apos;t want to b@@ el@@ ong to any str@@ ing the@@ ory clu@@ b that would have me as a member .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts cer@@ tain op@@ in@@ i@@ ons must be ex@@ clu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a d@@ om@@ ain of exper@@ ti@@ se .
That is what it is for know@@ le@@ dge to coun@@ t .
"@@ How have we con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed ourselves that in the mor@@ al sp@@ here there is no such thing as mor@@ al exper@@ ti@@ se , or mor@@ al tal@@ ent , or mor@@ al gen@@ i@@ us even ? How have we con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ in@@ ion has to coun@@ t ? How have we con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ jects wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ?
D@@ o@@ es the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an have a point of view on phys@@ ics that is wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ig@@ n@@ or@@ ance any less obvi@@ ous on the sub@@ ject of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now ."
"It needs people like ourselves to ad@@ m@@ it that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing , and mor@@ ality rel@@ ates to that d@@ om@@ ain of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for individu@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beli@@ e@@ f@@ s and des@@ i@@ res that reli@@ ably le@@ ad to nee@@ d@@ less human su@@ ff@@ ering ."
J@@ ust ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting this will trans@@ form our di@@ sc@@ our@@ se about mor@@ ality .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies between n@@ ations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world f@@ ill@@ ed with de@@ struc@@ tive technology , and this technology can@@ not be un@@ inv@@ ented ; it will always be eas@@ i@@ er to bre@@ ak things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It se@@ ems to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , pat@@ ently obvi@@ ous that we can no more resp@@ ect and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in no@@ tions of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being than we can resp@@ ect or t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in the no@@ tions about how disease sp@@ re@@ ads , or in the sa@@ fe@@ ty st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of buil@@ d@@ ings and air@@ plan@@ es ."
We sim@@ ply must conver@@ ge on the ans@@ w@@ ers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ m@@ it that these questions have ans@@ w@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ bus@@ ti@@ ble materi@@ al there ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther in this au@@ dience or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , hear@@ ing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ ra@@ ge thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age se@@ ems to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women dre@@ s@@ sed in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in the Mus@@ li@@ m world , sp@@ o@@ ken with a lot of Mus@@ li@@ m women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a c@@ ele@@ bra@@ tion of f@@ em@@ ale speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a res@@ ult of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is ar@@ gu@@ ably a s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical view — &quot; that m@@ ale l@@ ust is not to be tru@@ st@@ ed . &quot;"
"I mean , can you eng@@ age in a conver@@ sa@@ tion with that kind of woman without se@@ em@@ ing kind of cul@@ tur@@ al im@@ per@@ i@@ al@@ ist ?"
"S@@ am H@@ ar@@ r@@ is : Yeah , well I think I tri@@ ed to bro@@ ach this in a s@@ ent@@ ence , wat@@ ching the c@@ loc@@ k tic@@ king , but the question is : What is vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary in a cont@@ ext where men have cer@@ tain exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a cer@@ tain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il y@@ our@@ self ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to we@@ ar a ve@@ il , or a very fun@@ n@@ y h@@ at , or t@@ at@@ too their face — I think we should be free to vol@@ un@@ t@@ ar@@ ily do what@@ ever we want , but we have to be h@@ on@@ est about the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that these women are plac@@ ed under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ag@@ er to always take their word for it , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re w@@ ear@@ ing a full bur@@ q@@ a ."
C@@ A : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of mor@@ al pro@@ gre@@ ss .
But can you re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that ?
"I think I underst@@ ood you to say that you could re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one di@@ men@@ sion@@ al , where we all have to think the same ."
"P@@ a@@ int your picture of what ro@@ l@@ ling the c@@ loc@@ k 50 years for@@ ward , 100 years for@@ ward , how you would like to think of the world , b@@ al@@ anc@@ ing mor@@ al pro@@ gre@@ ss with r@@ ic@@ h@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ m@@ it that we are on the p@@ ath to@@ ward underst@@ anding our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important de@@ ta@@ il , then you have to ad@@ m@@ it that we are going to understand all of the posi@@ tive and ne@@ g@@ ative qu@@ ali@@ ties of ourselves in much gre@@ ater de@@ ta@@ il ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand posi@@ tive social emo@@ tion like em@@ pa@@ thy and comp@@ as@@ sion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge it — whether they &apos;re gen@@ e@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and in@@ so@@ far as we beg@@ in to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably going to conver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gr@@ ab@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my d@@ aughter from b@@ ir@@ th is just as good as te@@ ach@@ ing her to be con@@ fi@@ dent and w@@ ell@@ -@@ educ@@ ated in the cont@@ ext of men who do des@@ ire women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that comp@@ ul@@ s@@ ory ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a cer@@ tain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone invol@@ ved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
D@@ o people love their d@@ augh@@ ters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ w@@ ers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the res@@ ul@@ ts come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ par@@ ed to shi@@ ft your inst@@ inc@@ tive curr@@ ent ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these issu@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well ye@@ a@@ h , mo@@ d@@ ul@@ o one obvi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the cont@@ ext of a tru@@ ly d@@ el@@ us@@ i@@ on@@ al beli@@ e@@ f system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my g@@ ay son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a bo@@ y@@ friend , I ch@@ op@@ ped his head off . And that was the most comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those par@@ ts al@@ ig@@ ned , y@@ es I think you could probably be fe@@ eling the emo@@ tion of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about w@@ ell@@ -@@ being in a lar@@ ger cont@@ ext ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man fe@@ eling ec@@ st@@ as@@ y and then b@@ lo@@ wing h@@ im@@ self up on a b@@ us ."
"C@@ A : S@@ am , this is a conver@@ sa@@ tion I would actually love to contin@@ ue for hours ."

"And in@@ spi@@ red by what I learned from N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ i@@ el , I started an organ@@ ization on S@@ k@@ id R@@ ow of mus@@ ici@@ ans called S@@ tre@@ et S@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y , br@@ ing@@ ing the light of music into the very dar@@ k@@ est places , per@@ form@@ ing for the h@@ om@@ el@@ ess and m@@ ent@@ ally ill at sh@@ el@@ ters and cl@@ in@@ ics on S@@ k@@ id R@@ ow , per@@ form@@ ing for com@@ b@@ at ve@@ ter@@ ans with pos@@ t-@@ tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tic st@@ res@@ s dis@@ order , and for the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated and those l@@ ab@@ el@@ ed as cri@@ min@@ ally in@@ s@@ an@@ e ."
"A@@ f@@ ter one of our ev@@ ents at the P@@ att@@ on St@@ ate H@@ osp@@ ital in S@@ an B@@ er@@ n@@ ar@@ d@@ in@@ o , a woman wal@@ ked up to us and she had t@@ ear@@ s stre@@ am@@ ing down her face , and she had a p@@ al@@ s@@ y , she was s@@ ha@@ king , and she had this g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous sm@@ ile , and she said that she had never heard cl@@ ass@@ ical music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a viol@@ in before , but that hear@@ ing this music was like hear@@ ing the s@@ un@@ sh@@ ine , and that no@@ body ever came to vi@@ s@@ it them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she st@@ op@@ ped s@@ ha@@ king without me@@ dic@@ ation ."
"S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , what we &apos;re fin@@ ding with these con@@ cer@@ ts , away from the st@@ age , away from the fo@@ ot@@ li@@ ghts , out of the tu@@ x@@ e@@ do ta@@ il@@ s , the mus@@ ici@@ ans become the con@@ du@@ it for deli@@ ver@@ ing the tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous ther@@ ap@@ e@@ u@@ tic b@@ ene@@ f@@ its of music on the brain to an au@@ dience that would never have ac@@ cess to this room , would never have ac@@ cess to the kind of music that we make ."
"@@ J@@ ust as me@@ dic@@ ine ser@@ ves to he@@ al more than the building b@@ loc@@ ks of the body al@@ one , the power and beau@@ ty of music tran@@ sc@@ ends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our b@@ el@@ o@@ ved acr@@ on@@ y@@ m ."
Mus@@ ic tran@@ sc@@ ends the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic beau@@ ty al@@ one .
"The sy@@ n@@ ch@@ r@@ on@@ y of emo@@ tions that we experience when we hear an oper@@ a by W@@ ag@@ ner , or a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y by B@@ ra@@ h@@ ms , or cha@@ m@@ ber music by B@@ e@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven , comp@@ els us to remember our shar@@ ed , common hum@@ an@@ ity , the de@@ ep@@ ly commun@@ al connec@@ ted con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , the em@@ pa@@ th@@ ic con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness that ne@@ u@@ rop@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ st I@@ ain M@@ c@@ G@@ il@@ ch@@ ri@@ st says is har@@ d@@ -@@ wi@@ red into our brain &apos;s right h@@ em@@ i@@ sp@@ here ."

"And the sp@@ ar@@ k of that beau@@ ty , the sp@@ ar@@ k of that hum@@ an@@ ity trans@@ for@@ ms into hope , and we know , whether we cho@@ ose the p@@ ath of music or of me@@ dic@@ ine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must in@@ still within our comm@@ uni@@ ties , within our au@@ di@@ ences , if we want to in@@ sp@@ ire heal@@ ing from within ."
"I &apos;d like to end with a quot@@ e by J@@ o@@ h@@ n K@@ e@@ ats , the R@@ om@@ an@@ tic En@@ g@@ li@@ sh po@@ et , a very fam@@ ous quot@@ e that I &apos;m sure all of you know ."

"That is all y@@ e know on Earth , and all y@@ e need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause )"
"Th@@ ank you so much everyone from TED , and Ch@@ r@@ is and A@@ my in particular ."
I can@@ not believe I &apos;m here .
I have not s@@ le@@ pt in wee@@ ks .
"N@@ e@@ il and I were sit@@ ting there com@@ par@@ ing how little we &apos;ve s@@ le@@ pt in an@@ tici@@ p@@ ation for this . I &apos;ve never been so ner@@ v@@ ous — and I do this when I &apos;m ner@@ v@@ ous , I just real@@ ized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organ@@ ization called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might jo@@ in in and do sim@@ il@@ ar things ."
"B@@ ack in about 20@@ 00 , I was living in B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n , I was trying to fin@@ ish my first book , I was w@@ and@@ ering around d@@ a@@ z@@ ed every day because I wr@@ ote from 12 a@@ .@@ m@@ . to 5 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
So I would walk around in a d@@ a@@ ze during the day .
"I had no m@@ ental ac@@ u@@ ity to spe@@ ak of during the day , but I had f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble hours ."
"In the B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood that I li@@ ved in , P@@ ar@@ k S@@ lo@@ p@@ e , there are a lot of writ@@ ers — it &apos;s like a very high per cap@@ it@@ a ra@@ ti@@ o of writ@@ ers to norm@@ al people ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , I had gro@@ wn up around a lot of te@@ ach@@ ers ."
"M@@ y mo@@ m was a te@@ ac@@ her , my si@@ ster became a te@@ ac@@ her and after col@@ le@@ ge so many of my friends went into te@@ ach@@ ing ."
"And so I was always hear@@ ing them talk about their lives and how in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing they were , and they were really sort of the most har@@ d@@ -@@ working and con@@ st@@ an@@ tly in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing people I knew ."
"But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the str@@ u@@ gg@@ les they were de@@ al@@ ing with ."
"And one of them was that so many of my friends that were te@@ ach@@ ing in city s@@ cho@@ ols were having tr@@ ou@@ ble with their students ke@@ ep@@ ing up at gra@@ de level , in their read@@ ing and wr@@ iting in particular ."
"Now , so many of these students had come from h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds where En@@ g@@ li@@ sh isn &apos;t sp@@ o@@ ken in the home , where a lot of them have different speci@@ al needs , learning dis@@ ab@@ ili@@ ties . And of course they &apos;re working in s@@ cho@@ ols which sometimes and very often are under@@ -@@ fund@@ ed ."
"And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bo@@ dies , more on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion , more hours , more exper@@ ti@@ se from people that have sk@@ ill@@ s in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh and can work with these students on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five cl@@ ass@@ es of 30 to 40 students each ."
"This can le@@ ad up to 1@@ 50 , 1@@ 80 , 2@@ 00 students a day ."
How can we possi@@ bly give each stud@@ ent even one h@@ our a week of on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to gre@@ at@@ ly mul@@ ti@@ ply the wor@@ k@@ week and cl@@ one the te@@ ach@@ ers .
And so we started talking about this .
"And at the same time , I thought about this m@@ as@@ sive group of people I knew : writ@@ ers , ed@@ it@@ ors , jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sts , gra@@ du@@ ate students , as@@ si@@ st@@ ant prof@@ ess@@ ors , you name it ."
"A@@ ll these people that had sort of f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble d@@ a@@ ily hours and an inter@@ est in the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh word — I hope to have an inter@@ est in the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh language , but I &apos;m not spe@@ a@@ king it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That c@@ loc@@ k has got me ."
"But everyone that I knew had an inter@@ est in the pri@@ m@@ acy of the writ@@ ten word in terms of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing a demo@@ cr@@ acy , n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing an en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed life ."
"And so they had , you know , their time and their inter@@ est , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a con@@ du@@ it that I knew of in my community to bring these two comm@@ uni@@ ties together ."
"So when I mo@@ ved back to S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , we r@@ ented this building ."
"And the idea was to put M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s — M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s Q@@ u@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly , that we publi@@ shed tw@@ ice or three times a year , and a few other mag@@ a@@ z@@ ines — we were going to move it into an off@@ ice for the first time ."
It used to be in my k@@ it@@ ch@@ en in B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n .
"We were going to move it into an off@@ ice , and we were going to actually share space with a tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter ."
"So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writ@@ ers and ed@@ it@@ ors and everybody — sort of a wr@@ iting community — coming into the off@@ ice every day any@@ way , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get ex@@ tr@@ a help on their writ@@ ten h@@ ome@@ work , so you have basically no bor@@ der between these two comm@@ uni@@ ties ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on what@@ ever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . the students f@@ low in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you tra@@ de , or you work a little bit later or what@@ ever it is ."
You give those hours in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on to the students in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood .
"So , we had this place , we r@@ ented it , the l@@ and@@ l@@ ord was all for it . We did this m@@ ural , that &apos;s a Ch@@ r@@ is W@@ are m@@ ural , that basically expl@@ a@@ ins the entire history of the prin@@ ted word , in m@@ ural form — it takes a long time to dig@@ est and you have to st@@ and in the middle of the ro@@ ad ."
So we r@@ ented this space .
"And everything was great ex@@ cept the l@@ and@@ l@@ ord said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is z@@ on@@ ed for re@@ ta@@ il ; you have to come up with something ."
You &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ t@@ a s@@ ell something .
"You can &apos;t just have a tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; H@@ a h@@ a ! Re@@ ally ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily to s@@ ell , but we did all the nec@@ ess@@ ary research ."
"It used to be a we@@ ight room , so there were ru@@ b@@ ber flo@@ ors b@@ el@@ ow , ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ c ti@@ le ce@@ il@@ ings and flu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent li@@ ghts ."
"We took all that down , and we found beautiful w@@ oo@@ d@@ en flo@@ ors , wh@@ it@@ e@@ was@@ h@@ ed be@@ am@@ s and it had the look — while we were r@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the h@@ ul@@ l of a ship . &quot;"
"And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should s@@ ell sup@@ p@@ li@@ es to the working b@@ uc@@ can@@ e@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody l@@ au@@ gh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that ."
Let &apos;s s@@ ell p@@ ir@@ ate sup@@ p@@ li@@ es . &quot; &quot; This is the p@@ ir@@ ate sup@@ ply st@@ ore .
"You see , this is sort of a s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch I did on a n@@ ap@@ k@@ in ."
"A great car@@ p@@ en@@ ter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of p@@ ir@@ ate sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ like ."
Here you see plan@@ ks so@@ ld by the f@@ oo@@ t and we have sup@@ p@@ li@@ es to com@@ b@@ at sc@@ ur@@ v@@ y .
"We have the pe@@ g le@@ gs there , that are all h@@ and@@ made and f@@ it@@ ted to you ."
"@@ U@@ p at the top , you see the e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ch dis@@ play , which is the black col@@ um@@ n there for every@@ day use for your e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ch , and then you have the pa@@ ste@@ l and other col@@ ors for ste@@ p@@ ping out at night — speci@@ al oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ ons , b@@ ar m@@ it@@ z@@ v@@ a@@ h@@ s and what@@ ever ."
So we op@@ en@@ ed this place . And this is a v@@ at that we f@@ ill with tre@@ as@@ u@@ res that students di@@ g in .
This is re@@ plac@@ ement eyes in case you l@@ ose one .
These are some sig@@ ns that we have all over the place : &quot; P@@ r@@ ac@@ tical J@@ o@@ king with P@@ ir@@ ates . &quot;
"Wh@@ ile you &apos;re read@@ ing the sig@@ n , we pul@@ l a rop@@ e behind the coun@@ ter and e@@ ight mo@@ p he@@ ads dro@@ p on your head ."
That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that dro@@ ps on people &apos;s he@@ ads .
"It became mo@@ p he@@ ads . And this is the fish the@@ ater , which is just a s@@ al@@ tw@@ ater t@@ ank with three se@@ ats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter ."
"So right there is the tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter , and then behind the cur@@ tain were the M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s off@@ ices , where all of us would be working on the mag@@ a@@ z@@ ine and book ed@@ iting and things like that ."
The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
"We set the place up , we op@@ en@@ ed up , we sp@@ ent months and months r@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place ."
"We had t@@ ab@@ les , cha@@ ir@@ s , compu@@ ters , everything ."
I went to a d@@ ot@@ -@@ co@@ m a@@ uc@@ tion at a H@@ o@@ li@@ day In@@ n in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to and I b@@ ou@@ ght 11 G@@ 4@@ s with a st@@ ro@@ ke of a p@@ ad@@ dle .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , we b@@ ou@@ ght &apos; e@@ m , we set everything up and then we wa@@ ited ."
"It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writ@@ ers in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood ."
"And we s@@ at . And at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . we put a s@@ and@@ w@@ ich bo@@ ard out on the front si@@ de@@ walk and it just said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree T@@ ut@@ or@@ ing for Y@@ our En@@ g@@ li@@ sh@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated and W@@ r@@ it@@ ing@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated N@@ e@@ e@@ ds — J@@ ust C@@ ome In , It &apos;s A@@ ll F@@ ree . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to stor@@ m the g@@ ates , they &apos;re g@@ on@@ n@@ a love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t ."
"And so we wa@@ ited , we s@@ at at the t@@ ab@@ les , we wa@@ ited and wa@@ ited ."
"And everybody was bec@@ om@@ ing very di@@ sc@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed because it was wee@@ ks and wee@@ ks that we wa@@ ited , really , where no@@ body came in ."
"And then somebody al@@ er@@ ted us to the fact that maybe there was a tr@@ ust ga@@ p , because we were oper@@ ating behind a p@@ ir@@ ate sup@@ ply st@@ ore . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?"
"And so then , around that time , I per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed a woman nam@@ ed N@@ in@@ ev@@ e@@ h C@@ al@@ ig@@ ar@@ i , a lon@@ g@@ time S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o educ@@ ator — she was te@@ ach@@ ing in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity , she had all the experience nec@@ ess@@ ary , knew everything about education , was connec@@ ted with all the te@@ ach@@ ers and community mem@@ bers in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood — I con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed her to move up from M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity where she was te@@ ach@@ ing ."
She took over as ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive direc@@ tor .
"I@@ m@@ medi@@ ately , she made the in@@ ro@@ ads with the te@@ ach@@ ers and the parents and the students and everything , and so su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly it was actually full every day ."
And what we were trying to off@@ er every day was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion .
The go@@ al was to have a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one ra@@ ti@@ o with every one of these students .
"You know , it &apos;s been pro@@ ven that 3@@ 5 to 40 hours a year with on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion , a stud@@ ent can get one gra@@ de level high@@ er ."
"And so most of these students , En@@ g@@ li@@ sh is not sp@@ o@@ ken in the home ."
"They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a ch@@ ur@@ ch pe@@ w that I b@@ ou@@ ght in a B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey a@@ uc@@ tion right there — the parents will sometimes wat@@ ch while their kids are being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"So that was the bas@@ is of it , was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion ."
And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
"If you &apos;re on V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a S@@ tre@@ et within those few b@@ loc@@ ks at around 2 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big bac@@ k@@ p@@ ac@@ ks , or what@@ ever , actually run@@ ning to this space , which is very str@@ an@@ ge , because it &apos;s school , in a way ."
But there was something p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical happening there that was just a little bit different .
"And the other thing was , there was no sti@@ g@@ m@@ a ."
"@@ K@@ i@@ ds wer@@ en &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; C@@ en@@ ter@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ K@@ id@@ s@@ -@@ Th@@ at@@ -@@ N@@ e@@ ed@@ -@@ M@@ o@@ re@@ -@@ H@@ el@@ p , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it was a p@@ ir@@ ate sup@@ ply st@@ ore , which is in@@ s@@ an@@ e ."
"And then secon@@ d@@ ly , there &apos;s a publi@@ sh@@ ing company in the back ."
"And so our inter@@ ns were actually working at the same t@@ ab@@ les very often , and sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , compu@@ ter@@ -@@ nex@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ computer with the students ."
"And so it became a tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter — publi@@ sh@@ ing cen@@ ter , is what we called it — and a wr@@ iting cen@@ ter ."
"They go in , and they might be working with a high school stud@@ ent actually working on a nov@@ el — because we had very gi@@ f@@ ted kids , too ."
So there &apos;s no sti@@ g@@ m@@ a .
They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a cre@@ ative en@@ de@@ av@@ or .
They &apos;re seeing ad@@ ul@@ ts . They &apos;re mo@@ d@@ eling their behavi@@ or .
"Th@@ ese ad@@ ul@@ ts , they &apos;re working in their fiel@@ d ."
"They can le@@ an over , ask a question of one of these ad@@ ul@@ ts and it all sort of fe@@ e@@ ds on each other ."
"There &apos;s a lot of cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ pol@@ l@@ in@@ ation . The only problem , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally for the ad@@ ul@@ ts working at M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s who ha@@ dn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily b@@ ou@@ ght into all of this when they sig@@ ned up , was that there was just the one b@@ a@@ th@@ room . ( Laughter ) W@@ ith like 60 kids a day , this is a problem ."
"But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ing their h@@ ome@@ work in a given day , working on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one , getting all this at@@ ten@@ tion — they go home , they &apos;re fin@@ i@@ shed . They don &apos;t st@@ all ."
They don &apos;t do their h@@ ome@@ work in front of the T@@ V .
"They &apos;re allo@@ wed to go home at 5 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , en@@ jo@@ y their family , en@@ jo@@ y other h@@ ob@@ bi@@ es , get outside , play ."
And that makes a happy family .
A b@@ un@@ ch of happy famili@@ es in a ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood is a happy community .
A b@@ un@@ ch of happy comm@@ uni@@ ties ti@@ ed together is a happy city and a happy world .
"So the key to it all is h@@ ome@@ work ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion ."
"So we started off with about 12 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hund@@ red ."
"And we now have 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers on our r@@ os@@ ter ."
And we make it incredi@@ bly easy to vol@@ un@@ te@@ er .
"The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a mon@@ th , those two hours sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , next to one stud@@ ent , con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated at@@ ten@@ tion , sh@@ ining this be@@ am of light on their work , on their thou@@ ghts and their self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , is going to be ab@@ solu@@ tely trans@@ for@@ ma@@ tive , because so many of the students have not had that ever before ."
"So we said , &quot; &quot; E@@ ven if you have two hours one S@@ und@@ ay every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s par@@ tly why the tu@@ tor cor@@ ps gre@@ w so f@@ ast ."
"Th@@ en we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . ? &quot; &quot; So we started br@@ ing@@ ing in cl@@ ass@@ es during the day ."
"So every day , there &apos;s a fiel@@ d tri@@ p where they together create a book — you can see it being typ@@ ed up ab@@ o@@ ve ."
This is one of the cl@@ ass@@ es getting way too exc@@ ited about wr@@ iting .
"You just point a cam@@ er@@ a at a cl@@ ass , and it always looks like this ."
So this is one of the bo@@ o@@ ks that they do .
"N@@ o@@ tice the ti@@ tle of the book , &quot; The B@@ ook That W@@ as N@@ ever Ch@@ ec@@ ked O@@ ut : T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot;"
"And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce there was a book nam@@ ed C@@ in@@ dy that was about the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot; &quot; So , me@@ an@@ while , there &apos;s an ad@@ ult in the back typ@@ ing this up , taking it completely ser@@ i@@ ously , which b@@ lo@@ ws their mind ."
So then we still had more tu@@ tors to use .
This is a sho@@ t of just some of the tu@@ tors during one of the ev@@ ents .
The te@@ ach@@ ers that we work with — and everything is different to te@@ ach@@ ers — they tell us what to do .
"We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ul@@ tim@@ ately , completely m@@ al@@ le@@ able . You &apos;re going to tell us ."
"The ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us ."
"The te@@ ach@@ ers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most us@@ e@@ ful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the s@@ cho@@ ols ?"
"Because what about the students that w@@ ouldn &apos;t come to you , nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily , who don &apos;t have really ac@@ tive parents that are br@@ ing@@ ing them in , or ar@@ en &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 people on our tu@@ tor r@@ os@@ ter ."
"L@@ et &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A te@@ ac@@ her will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tu@@ tors for the next five S@@ und@@ ays ."
"We &apos;re working on our col@@ le@@ ge es@@ says . S@@ end them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the w@@ ire : 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 tu@@ tors ."
Wh@@ o@@ ever can make it sig@@ ns up . They go in about a half an h@@ our before the cl@@ ass .
"The te@@ ac@@ her t@@ ells them what to do , how to do it , what their tra@@ ining is , what their project is so far ."
"They work under the te@@ ac@@ her &apos;s gu@@ i@@ de , and it &apos;s all in one big room ."
"And that &apos;s actually the br@@ un@@ t of what we do is , people going stra@@ ight from their wor@@ k@@ place , stra@@ ight from home , stra@@ ight into the cl@@ ass@@ room and working direc@@ tly with the students ."
So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
"Th@@ en another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a cl@@ ass@@ room and you can sta@@ ff it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the E@@ ver@@ et@@ t M@@ id@@ dle S@@ ch@@ ool W@@ r@@ it@@ ers &apos; R@@ oo@@ m , where we dec@@ or@@ ated it in b@@ uc@@ can@@ e@@ er st@@ y@@ le ."
It &apos;s right off the li@@ br@@ ary . And there we ser@@ ve all 5@@ 2@@ 9 kids in this middle school .
"This is their ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper , the &quot; &quot; S@@ tra@@ igh@@ t-@@ U@@ p N@@ e@@ ws , &quot; &quot; that has an on@@ going col@@ um@@ n from M@@ ay@@ or G@@ av@@ in N@@ e@@ w@@ so@@ m in both langu@@ ages — En@@ g@@ li@@ sh and S@@ p@@ an@@ ish ."
"So then one day I@@ s@@ ab@@ el Al@@ l@@ en@@ de wr@@ ote to us and said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why don &apos;t you as@@ sig@@ n a book with high school students ?"
"I want them to wr@@ ite about how to ac@@ hi@@ eve pe@@ ace in a viol@@ ent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Th@@ ur@@ good Mar@@ sh@@ all H@@ i@@ gh S@@ ch@@ ool , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment to the students ."
"And we said , &quot; &quot; I@@ s@@ ab@@ el Al@@ l@@ en@@ de is going to read all your es@@ says at the end ."
She &apos;s going to publi@@ sh them in a book .
She &apos;s going to sp@@ on@@ s@@ or the prin@@ ting of this book in p@@ ap@@ er@@ back form .
"It &apos;s going to be av@@ a@@ il@@ able in all the bo@@ o@@ k@@ st@@ o@@ res in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a and throu@@ gh@@ out the world , on A@@ ma@@ z@@ on and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside au@@ dience , there was I@@ s@@ ab@@ el Al@@ l@@ en@@ de on the other end ."
I think we had about 1@@ 7@@ 0 tu@@ tors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredi@@ bly well .
We had a big par@@ ty at the end .
This is a book that you can find any@@ where . So that led to a ser@@ ies of these .
"You can see A@@ my T@@ an sp@@ on@@ so@@ red the next one , &quot; I M@@ ight G@@ et S@@ ome@@ where . &quot;"
And this became an on@@ going thing . M@@ ore and more bo@@ o@@ ks .
Now we &apos;re sort of ad@@ dic@@ ted to the book thing .
"The kids will work har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be per@@ man@@ ent , know it &apos;s going to be on a sh@@ el@@ f , know that no@@ body can di@@ min@@ ish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve h@@ on@@ o@@ red their words , h@@ on@@ o@@ red their thou@@ ghts with hund@@ re@@ ds of hours of five dra@@ f@@ ts , six dra@@ f@@ ts — all this at@@ ten@@ tion that we give to their thou@@ ghts ."
"And once they ac@@ hi@@ eve that level , once they &apos;ve writ@@ ten at that level , they can never go back ."
It &apos;s ab@@ solu@@ tely trans@@ for@@ ma@@ tive .
And so then they &apos;re all so@@ ld in the st@@ ore . This is ne@@ ar the plan@@ ks .
We s@@ ell all the stud@@ ent bo@@ o@@ ks .
"Wh@@ ere else would you put them , right ?"
"So we s@@ ell &apos; e@@ m , and then something we@@ ird had been happening with the st@@ o@@ res . The st@@ ore , actually — even though we started out as just a ga@@ g — the st@@ ore actually made money ."
So it was p@@ ay@@ ing the r@@ ent .
"And maybe this is just a S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to ju@@ dge ."
But people would come in — and this was before the p@@ ir@@ ate movi@@ es and everything !
"It was making a lot of money . N@@ ot a lot of money , but it was p@@ ay@@ ing the r@@ ent , p@@ ay@@ ing a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time sta@@ ff member there ."
There &apos;s the ocean m@@ aps you can see on the left .
And it became a g@@ ate@@ way to the community .
"P@@ e@@ ople would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?"
What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to s@@ we@@ ar on the we@@ b . ( Laughter ) I@@ s that a ru@@ le ? I don &apos;t know .
"They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it ."
"And then right be@@ y@@ on@@ d — there &apos;s us@@ u@@ ally a little cha@@ in there — right be@@ y@@ on@@ d , they would see the kids being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"This is a fiel@@ d tri@@ p going on . And so they would be sh@@ op@@ ping , and they might be more li@@ ke@@ ly to bu@@ y some l@@ ard , or mil@@ let for their par@@ ro@@ t , or , you know , a h@@ ook , or h@@ ook prot@@ ec@@ tor for ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time , all of these things we s@@ ell ."
So the st@@ ore actually did really well .
"But it b@@ rou@@ ght in so many people — te@@ ach@@ ers , d@@ on@@ ors , vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , everybody — because it was stre@@ et level . It was open to the public ."
"It wasn &apos;t a non@@ -@@ prof@@ it bur@@ i@@ ed , you know , on the 3@@ 0@@ th flo@@ or of some building do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn . It was right in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood that it was ser@@ ving , and it was open all the time to the public ."
"So , it became this sort of we@@ ird , happy ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So all the people I used to know in B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;"
"And a lot of them had been form@@ er educ@@ at@@ ors or w@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ be educ@@ at@@ ors , so they com@@ b@@ ined with a lot of local desig@@ n@@ ers , local writ@@ ers , and they just took the idea in@@ dep@@ end@@ ently and they did their own thing ."
They didn &apos;t want to s@@ ell p@@ ir@@ ate sup@@ p@@ li@@ es .
They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
"So , kno@@ wing the cri@@ me@@ -@@ fi@@ gh@@ ting community in New York , they op@@ en@@ ed the B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n S@@ u@@ per@@ her@@ o S@@ up@@ ply C@@ om@@ p@@ any ."
This is S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts &apos; great design that did this .
"And this was to make it look sort of like one of those ke@@ y@@ sm@@ ith &apos;s sh@@ op@@ s that has to have every serv@@ ice they &apos;ve ever off@@ er@@ ed , you know , all over there ."
"So they op@@ en@@ ed this place . In@@ side , it &apos;s like a C@@ os@@ t@@ c@@ o for super@@ her@@ o@@ es — all the sup@@ p@@ li@@ es in kind of bas@@ ic form ."
These are all h@@ and@@ made .
"Th@@ ese are all sort of re@@ pur@@ posed other produc@@ ts , or what@@ ever ."
A@@ ll the p@@ ac@@ k@@ ag@@ ing is done by S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts .
"So then you have the v@@ il@@ la@@ in con@@ tain@@ ment un@@ it , where kids put their parents . You have the off@@ ice ."
"This is a little v@@ a@@ ult — you have to put your produc@@ t in there , it goes up an elec@@ tri@@ c li@@ ft and then the guy behind the coun@@ ter t@@ ells you that you have to rec@@ ite the v@@ ow of her@@ o@@ ism , which you do , if you want to bu@@ y anything . And it lim@@ its , really , their s@@ al@@ es ."
"P@@ er@@ son@@ ally , I think it &apos;s a problem ."
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
These are some of the produc@@ ts . These are all h@@ and@@ made .
This is a sec@@ re@@ t id@@ enti@@ ty k@@ it .
"If you want to take on the id@@ enti@@ ty of S@@ har@@ on B@@ o@@ one , one American f@@ em@@ ale mar@@ ke@@ ting ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive from H@@ o@@ bo@@ ken , New J@@ er@@ se@@ y . It &apos;s a full d@@ os@@ si@@ er on everything you would need to know about S@@ har@@ on B@@ o@@ one ."
"So , this is the cap@@ ery where you get f@@ it@@ ted for your cap@@ e , and then you walk up these three ste@@ el@@ -@@ gra@@ ded ste@@ ps and then we turn on three hy@@ dra@@ u@@ li@@ c f@@ ans from every side and then you can see the cap@@ e in action ."
"There &apos;s nothing wor@@ se than , you know , getting up there and the cap@@ e is b@@ un@@ ching up or something like that ."
"So then , the sec@@ re@@ t do@@ or — this is one of the sh@@ el@@ ves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly op@@ ens ."
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grap@@ pl@@ ing h@@ oo@@ ks .
It op@@ ens and then this is the tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full eff@@ ect !
"But this is — I just want to emp@@ ha@@ size — loc@@ ally fund@@ ed , loc@@ ally built ."
"A@@ ll the desig@@ n@@ ers , all of the buil@@ d@@ ers , everybody was local , all the time was pro@@ -@@ b@@ on@@ o ."
"I just came and vi@@ s@@ ited and said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or what@@ ever . That was it . You can see the time in all five bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing hours ."
"It &apos;s very bus@@ y . S@@ ame prin@@ ci@@ ples : on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion , comple@@ te dev@@ o@@ tion to the students &apos; work and a b@@ oun@@ d@@ less op@@ tim@@ ism and sort of a possi@@ bility of cre@@ a@@ tivity and ideas ."
"And this s@@ w@@ it@@ ch is f@@ lic@@ ked in their he@@ ads when they walk through those 1@@ 8 fe@@ et of this bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re st@@ ore , right ?"
"So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school ."
"It &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly not school , even though they &apos;re working sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der on t@@ ab@@ les , p@@ enc@@ il@@ s and p@@ ap@@ ers , what@@ ever ."
"This is one of the students , K@@ hal@@ ed H@@ am@@ d@@ an ."
You can read this quot@@ e .
A@@ d@@ dic@@ ted to video g@@ am@@ es and T@@ V . C@@ ouldn &apos;t con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate at home .
C@@ ame in . G@@ ot this con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated at@@ ten@@ tion .
And he couldn &apos;t es@@ cap@@ e it .
"So , so@@ on enough , he was wr@@ iting . He would fin@@ ish his h@@ ome@@ work early — got really ad@@ dic@@ ted to fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ing his h@@ ome@@ work early ."
"It &apos;s an ad@@ dic@@ tive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it ch@@ ec@@ ked , and to know he &apos;s going to ac@@ hi@@ eve the next thing and be pre@@ par@@ ed for school the next day ."
"So he got h@@ oo@@ ked on that , and then he started doing other things ."
He &apos;s now been publi@@ shed in five bo@@ o@@ ks .
"He co@@ -@@ wr@@ ote a mo@@ c@@ k@@ um@@ ent@@ ary about fa@@ il@@ ed super@@ her@@ o@@ es called &quot; &quot; S@@ u@@ per@@ -@@ H@@ as@@ -@@ B@@ e@@ ens . &quot; &quot; He wr@@ ote a ser@@ ies on &quot; &quot; P@@ en@@ gu@@ in B@@ al@@ bo@@ a , &quot; &quot; which is a fi@@ gh@@ ting — a bo@@ x@@ ing — p@@ en@@ gu@@ in ."
"And then he read al@@ ou@@ d just a few wee@@ ks ago to 500 people at S@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y S@@ p@@ ace , at a b@@ ene@@ f@@ it for 8@@ 2@@ 6 New York . So he &apos;s there every day ."
He &apos;s ev@@ an@@ ge@@ lic@@ al about it . He br@@ ings his c@@ ous@@ ins in now .
There &apos;s four family mem@@ bers that come in every day .
"So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly ."
"This is L@@ .@@ A@@ . , The E@@ ch@@ o P@@ ar@@ k T@@ i@@ me T@@ ra@@ v@@ el M@@ art : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en@@ ever You A@@ re , We &apos;re Al@@ ready Th@@ en . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven for time tra@@ v@@ el@@ ers ."
So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven would be .
L@@ e@@ ech@@ es . M@@ am@@ m@@ ot@@ h ch@@ un@@ ks . They even have their own S@@ l@@ ur@@ pe@@ e machine : &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of O@@ r@@ der . C@@ ome B@@ ack Y@@ est@@ er@@ day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) An@@ y@@ way . So I &apos;m going to j@@ um@@ p a@@ head .
"Th@@ ese are sp@@ ac@@ es that are only aff@@ ili@@ ated with us , doing this same thing : W@@ ord St@@ . in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ fiel@@ d , M@@ ass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts ; In@@ k S@@ po@@ t in C@@ inc@@ in@@ nat@@ i ; Y@@ outh S@@ pe@@ a@@ ks , S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , which in@@ spi@@ red us ; S@@ tu@@ di@@ o St@@ .

Now I &apos;m going to the TED W@@ ish — is that o@@ kay ?
"A@@ ll right , I &apos;ve got a minut@@ e . So , the TED W@@ ish : I w@@ ish that you — you person@@ ally and every cre@@ ative individu@@ al and organ@@ ization you know — will find a way to direc@@ tly eng@@ age with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got invol@@ ved , so that within a year we have a thous@@ and exam@@ ples — a thous@@ and ! — of trans@@ for@@ ma@@ tive par@@ t@@ ner@@ shi@@ ps ."
P@@ ro@@ found le@@ aps for@@ ward !
And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
"I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and in@@ sp@@ ire others on the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite ."
We created a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite .
"I &apos;m going to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the at@@ ten@@ de@@ es of this conf@@ er@@ ence will us@@ her in a new er@@ a of par@@ tici@@ p@@ ation in our public s@@ cho@@ ols ."
We hope that you will take the le@@ ad in par@@ t@@ n@@ ering your innov@@ ative sp@@ ir@@ it and exper@@ ti@@ se with that of innov@@ ative educ@@ at@@ ors in your community .
Al@@ ways let the te@@ ach@@ ers le@@ ad the way .
They will tell you how to be us@@ e@@ ful . I hope that you &apos;ll ste@@ p in and help out .
There are a million ways .
You can walk up to your local school and con@@ s@@ ult with the te@@ ach@@ ers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
"So , this is with H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , they did this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al job ."
"This we@@ b@@ s@@ ite is already up , it &apos;s already got a b@@ un@@ ch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce U@@ p@@ on a S@@ ch@@ ool , &quot; &quot; which is a great ti@@ tle , I think ."
"This s@@ ite will doc@@ um@@ ent every story , every project that comes out of this conf@@ er@@ ence and around the world . So you go to the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , you see a b@@ un@@ ch of ideas you can be in@@ spi@@ red by and then you ad@@ d your own pro@@ jects once you get started ."
"H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o did a great job in a very ti@@ ght de@@ ad@@ line . So , vi@@ s@@ it the s@@ ite ."
"If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our direc@@ tor of national progra@@ ms . He &apos;ll be on the phone ."
"You e@@ ma@@ il him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possi@@ bly want ."
And he &apos;ll get you in@@ spi@@ red and get you going and gu@@ i@@ de you through the process so that you can aff@@ ect change .
And it can be fu@@ n ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it nee@@ dn &apos;t be st@@ er@@ ile . It nee@@ dn &apos;t be bu@@ re@@ a@@ uc@@ ra@@ tically un@@ ten@@ able .
You can do and use the sk@@ ill@@ s that you have .
The s@@ cho@@ ols need you . The te@@ ach@@ ers need you .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents and parents need you . They need your ac@@ tual person : your phys@@ ical person@@ h@@ ood and your open min@@ ds and open ear@@ s and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less comp@@ as@@ sion , sit@@ ting next to them , list@@ ening and no@@ d@@ ding and as@@ king questions for hours at a time ."
S@@ ome of these kids just don &apos;t pl@@ ain know how good they are : how s@@ mar@@ t and how much they have to say .
"You can tell them . You can sh@@ ine that light on them , one human inter@@ action at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll jo@@ in us ."
Thank you so much .
( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
And I say &quot; &quot; th@@ ank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was sil@@ ent for 1@@ 7 years .
"And the first words that I sp@@ o@@ ke were in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , on the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth D@@ ay ."
And my family and friends had ga@@ ther@@ ed there to hear me spe@@ ak .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the au@@ dience , she j@@ um@@ ped up , &quot; H@@ all@@ el@@ u@@ j@@ a@@ h , J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ n@@ y ’ s talking ! &quot;"
"( Laughter ) I@@ mag@@ ine if you were qui@@ et for 1@@ 7 years and your mother was out in the au@@ dience , say ."
"M@@ y d@@ ad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll expl@@ ain that ."
But I turned around because I didn ’ t reco@@ gn@@ ize where my vo@@ ice was coming from .
"I ha@@ dn ’ t heard my vo@@ ice in 1@@ 7 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; G@@ od , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;"
"And then I real@@ ized it was me , you know , and I kind of l@@ augh@@ ed ."
"And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is cra@@ z@@ y . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this jour@@ ney ."
"And the jour@@ ney , I believe , is a me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or for all of our jour@@ ne@@ ys ."
"E@@ ven though this one is kind of un@@ us@@ ual , I want you to think about your own jour@@ ney ."
"M@@ y jour@@ ney beg@@ an in 19@@ 7@@ 1 when I w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed two oil t@@ an@@ kers col@@ li@@ de b@@ ene@@ ath the G@@ ol@@ d@@ en G@@ ate , and a half a million g@@ all@@ ons of oil sp@@ ill@@ ed into the b@@ ay ."
It dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in m@@ ot@@ or@@ ized ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les .
That ’ s a big thing in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
"And it was a big thing in my little community of P@@ o@@ int R@@ eyes S@@ tation in In@@ ver@@ ness , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , because there were only about 3@@ 50 people there in the win@@ ter – this was back in &apos; 7@@ 1 now ."
"And so when I came in and I started wal@@ king around , people — they just knew what was going on ."
"And people would dri@@ ve up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; J@@ o@@ h@@ n , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m wal@@ king for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re wal@@ king to make us look bad , right ?"
"You ’ re wal@@ king to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some tru@@ th to that , because I thought that if I started wal@@ king , everyone would fol@@ low ."
"Because of the oil , everybody tal@@ ked about the pol@@ l@@ l@@ ution ."
"And so I ar@@ gu@@ ed with people about that , I ar@@ gu@@ ed and I ar@@ gu@@ ed ."
I called my parents up .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in car@@ s . &quot; &quot; My d@@ ad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 1@@ 6 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then ."
They ’ re back in P@@ h@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ p@@ hi@@ a .
"And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you w@@ ouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; M@@ others are like that ."
"And so , on my 2@@ 7@@ th b@@ ir@@ th@@ day I decided , because I ar@@ gu@@ ed so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop spe@@ a@@ king for just one day — one day — to give it a rest ."
And so I did .
I got up in the mor@@ ning and I didn ’ t say a word .
"And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I beg@@ an list@@ ening — in a long time ."
"And what I heard , it kind of dist@@ ur@@ bed me ."
"Because what I used to do , when I thought I was list@@ ening , was I would list@@ en just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I st@@ op@@ ped list@@ ening ."
"And in my mind , I just kind of r@@ ac@@ ed a@@ head and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ing up ."
And then I would la@@ un@@ ch in .
"Well , that just en@@ ded communic@@ ation ."
So on this first day I actually list@@ en@@ ed .
"And it was very sa@@ d for me , because I real@@ ized that for those many years I had not been learning ."
I was 2@@ 7 . I thought I knew everything .
I didn ’ t .
"And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I pr@@ om@@ is@@ ed myself for a year I would keep qui@@ et because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more ."
"So for a year I said I would keep qui@@ et , and then on my b@@ ir@@ th@@ day I would reas@@ s@@ ess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again ."
"Well , that la@@ st@@ ed 1@@ 7 years ."
"Now during that time — those 1@@ 7 years — I wal@@ ked and I play@@ ed the ban@@ j@@ o and I pa@@ in@@ ted and I wr@@ ote in my jour@@ n@@ al , and I tri@@ ed to study the environment by read@@ ing bo@@ o@@ ks ."
And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
"I wal@@ ked up to A@@ sh@@ land , O@@ reg@@ on , where they were off@@ ering an environ@@ m@@ ental stu@@ dies de@@ gre@@ e ."
It ’ s only 500 mil@@ es .
"And I went into the Re@@ gi@@ stra@@ r ’ s off@@ ice and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;"
I had a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper c@@ li@@ p@@ ping .
"&quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?"
You don ’ t … ?
We have a speci@@ al progra@@ m for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
"And in those two years , I gra@@ du@@ ated with my first de@@ gre@@ e — a bac@@ hel@@ or ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ."
"And my father came out , he was so p@@ rou@@ d ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , we ’ re really p@@ rou@@ d of you son , but what are you going to do with a bac@@ hel@@ or ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ?"
"You don ’ t ri@@ de in car@@ s , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I h@@ un@@ ched my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , I pic@@ ked my bac@@ k@@ p@@ ack up again and I started wal@@ king ."
"I wal@@ ked all the way up to P@@ ort T@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ s@@ end , W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , where I built a w@@ oo@@ d@@ en bo@@ at , ro@@ de it across P@@ u@@ get S@@ ound and wal@@ ked across W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton &#91; to &#93; I@@ d@@ a@@ h@@ o and down to M@@ is@@ s@@ ou@@ l@@ a , M@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ a ."
I had writ@@ ten the U@@ ni@@ versity of M@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ a two years ear@@ li@@ er and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
( Laughter ) And I was there . I sho@@ wed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really hel@@ ped me .
There are two stories in M@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ a .
The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sig@@ n I used a lot .
"And they said , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that . &quot; &quot; The direc@@ tor of the progra@@ m said , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome back tom@@ or@@ row . &quot; &quot; He gave me 1@@ 50 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Re@@ gi@@ ster for one cre@@ d@@ it ."
"You ’ re going to go to S@@ outh America , ar@@ en ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — R@@ i@@ ver@@ s and la@@ kes , the hy@@ dro@@ logical systems , S@@ outh America ."
So I did that .
"He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK J@@ o@@ h@@ n , now that you &apos;ve re@@ gi@@ st@@ er@@ ed for that one cre@@ d@@ it , you can have a key to an off@@ ice , you can mat@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ate — you ’ re mat@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ating , so you can use the li@@ br@@ ary ."
"And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the prof@@ ess@@ ors al@@ low you to go to cl@@ ass ."
"They ’ re going to sa@@ ve your gra@@ de , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can re@@ gi@@ ster for that cl@@ ass and they ’ ll give you the gra@@ de . &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , they don ’ t do that in gra@@ du@@ ate s@@ cho@@ ols , I don ’ t think ."
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
"They saw that I was really interest@@ ed in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way ."
"And during that time , I actually ta@@ u@@ ght cl@@ ass@@ es without spe@@ a@@ king ."
I had 1@@ 3 students when I first wal@@ ked into the cl@@ ass .
"I expl@@ ain@@ ed , with a friend who could inter@@ pre@@ t my sig@@ n language , that I was J@@ o@@ h@@ n F@@ r@@ anc@@ is , I was wal@@ king around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here inter@@ pre@@ ting for me ."
A@@ ll the students s@@ at around and they went ...
"( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the sch@@ e@@ du@@ le , to see when they could get out ."
They had to take that cl@@ ass with me .
"T@@ w@@ o wee@@ ks later , everyone was trying to get into our cl@@ ass ."
And I learned in that cl@@ ass — because I would do things like this ...
"@@ and they were all ga@@ ther@@ ed around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about cle@@ ar c@@ ut@@ ting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , cle@@ ar c@@ ut@@ ting . &quot;"
"&quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not cle@@ ar c@@ ut@@ ting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a h@@ and@@ saw . &quot;"
"&quot; Well , you can ’ t c@@ lear@@ c@@ ut with a ... &quot;"
"&quot; Y@@ es , you can cle@@ ar c@@ ut ... &quot;"
"&quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about sel@@ ec@@ tive fore@@ stry . &quot;"
Now this was a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion cl@@ ass and we were having a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion .
"I just bac@@ ked out of that , you know , and I just kind of ke@@ pt the fi@@ sts from fl@@ ying ."
"But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sig@@ n and they said things that I ab@@ solu@@ tely did not mean , but I should have ."
"And so what came to me is , if you were a te@@ ac@@ her and you were te@@ ach@@ ing , if you wer@@ en ’ t learning you probably wer@@ en ’ t te@@ ach@@ ing very well ."
And so I went on .
"M@@ y d@@ ad came out to see me gra@@ du@@ ate and , you know , I did the de@@ al , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really p@@ rou@@ d of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving and start talking ."
"What are you going to do with a ma@@ ster ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ? &quot; &quot; I h@@ un@@ ched my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , I got my bac@@ k@@ p@@ ack and I went on to the U@@ ni@@ versity of W@@ is@@ con@@ s@@ in ."
I sp@@ ent two years there wr@@ iting on oil sp@@ ill@@ s .
No one was interest@@ ed in oil sp@@ ill@@ s .
But something happened — E@@ x@@ x@@ on V@@ al@@ de@@ z .
And I was the only one in the United States wr@@ iting on oil sp@@ ill@@ s .
My d@@ ad came out again .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ri@@ de in car@@ s , you don ’ t talk ."
"M@@ y si@@ ster said maybe I should leave you al@@ one , because you see@@ m to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my bac@@ k@@ p@@ ack again ."
"I put my ban@@ j@@ o on and I wal@@ ked all the way to the E@@ ast C@@ o@@ ast , put my f@@ oo@@ t in the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an — it was se@@ ven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States ."
"And on Earth D@@ ay , 199@@ 0 — the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth D@@ ay — that ’ s when I beg@@ an to spe@@ ak ."
"And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that t@@ ree in the fore@@ st f@@ all@@ ing ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?"
"And I ’ m th@@ an@@ king you , and I &apos;m th@@ an@@ king my family because they had come to hear me spe@@ ak ."
And that ’ s communic@@ ation .
And they also ta@@ u@@ ght me about list@@ ening — that they list@@ en@@ ed to me .
"And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the sil@@ ence , the list@@ ening to each other ."
"@@ Re@@ ally , very important — we need to list@@ en to each other ."
"Well , my jour@@ ney ke@@ pt going on ."
"M@@ y d@@ ad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go ."
"I worked for the C@@ o@@ ast@@ gu@@ ard , was made a U.@@ N@@ . Goo@@ d@@ will A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"I wr@@ ote reg@@ ul@@ ations for the United States — I mean , I wr@@ ote oil sp@@ ill reg@@ ul@@ ations ."
"@@ 20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; J@@ o@@ h@@ n , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;"
"&quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; You just start wal@@ king e@@ ast ; get out of your car and just start wal@@ king e@@ ast . &quot; &quot; And as I wal@@ ked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and sh@@ ut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , bu@@ d@@ dy . &quot;"
"@@ How could that be , how could that be ?"
How could doing such a simple thing like wal@@ king and not talking make a difference ?
"Well , my time at the C@@ o@@ ast G@@ u@@ ard was a really good time ."
"And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at and I sa@@ il@@ ed down to the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , and wal@@ ked through all of the is@@ l@@ ands , and to V@@ ene@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ a ."
"And you know , I for@@ got the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you ."
I started talking because I had stu@@ died environment .
"I ’ d stu@@ died environment at this form@@ al level , but there was this infor@@ m@@ al level ."
"And the infor@@ m@@ al level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are ."
And environment changed from just being about tre@@ es and b@@ ir@@ ds and end@@ ang@@ er@@ ed species to being about how we tre@@ ated each other .
"Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we tre@@ at ourselves and how we tre@@ at each other ."
And so that ’ s the mess@@ age that I had .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to sp@@ read that mess@@ age . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at , sa@@ il@@ ed all the way through the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an — it wasn &apos;t really my sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at , I kind of worked on that bo@@ at — got to V@@ ene@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ a and I started wal@@ king ."
"This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ri@@ de in m@@ ot@@ or@@ ized ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les ."
"I was wal@@ king through E@@ l D@@ or@@ a@@ do — it &apos;s a pri@@ son to@@ wn , fam@@ ous pri@@ son , or in@@ fam@@ ous pri@@ son — in V@@ ene@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ a , and I don ’ t know what pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed me , because this was not like me ."
"There I am , wal@@ king past the gu@@ ard g@@ ate and the gu@@ ard st@@ op@@ s and says , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ ap@@ or@@ te , p@@ as@@ ap@@ or@@ te , &quot; &quot; and with an M@@ 1@@ 6 poin@@ ted at me ."
"And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ sp@@ ort , hu@@ h ?"
I don &apos;t need to show you my p@@ as@@ sp@@ ort . It ’ s in the back of my p@@ ack .
I &apos;m D@@ r@@ . F@@ r@@ anc@@ is ; I &apos;m a U.@@ N@@ . A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or and I &apos;m wal@@ king around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started wal@@ king off .
What pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed me to say this thing ?
The ro@@ ad turned into the j@@ un@@ gle .
I didn ’ t get sho@@ t .
"And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree at last — th@@ ank G@@ od Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?"
"It took me 100 mil@@ es to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a pri@@ son@@ er ."
I was a pri@@ son@@ er and I needed to es@@ cap@@ e .
The pri@@ son that I was in was the fact that I did not dri@@ ve or use m@@ ot@@ or@@ ized ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les .
Now how could that be ?
"Because when I started , it se@@ em@@ ed very appro@@ pri@@ ate to me not to use m@@ ot@@ or@@ ized ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les ."
"But the thing that was different was that every b@@ ir@@ th@@ day , I asked myself about sil@@ ence , but I never asked myself about my deci@@ sion to just use my fe@@ et ."
I had no idea I was going to become a U.@@ N@@ . A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or .
I had no idea I would have a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ .
"And so I real@@ ized that I had a respon@@ si@@ bility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change ."
"You know , we can do it ."
I was going to have to change .
"And I was af@@ ra@@ id to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just wal@@ ked ."
I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
But I know I needed to .
"I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today ."
"And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve g@@ ot@@ ten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go ."
"And we kind of have to leave behind the sec@@ ur@@ ity of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are bec@@ om@@ ing ."
"And so , I want to enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge you to go to that next place , to let y@@ our@@ self out of any pri@@ son that you might find y@@ our@@ self in , as com@@ for@@ table as it may be , because we have to do something now ."
We have to change now .
"As our form@@ er V@@ ice P@@ resi@@ dent said , we have to become ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts ."
"So if my vo@@ ice can tou@@ ch you , if my ac@@ tions can tou@@ ch you , if my being here can tou@@ ch you , ple@@ ase let it be ."
And I know that all of you have tou@@ ched me while I ’ ve been here .
"So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this car@@ ing , this love , this resp@@ ect that we ’ ve sho@@ wn each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world ."
"Because we are the environment , and how we tre@@ at each other is really how we ’ re going to tre@@ at the environment ."
So I want to th@@ ank you for being here and I want to end this in five secon@@ ds of sil@@ ence .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the l@@ at@@ est ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of India &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — lon@@ g@@ est run@@ ning so@@ a@@ p oper@@ a , which is cr@@ ic@@ ket ."
"And may it run fore@@ ver , because it gi@@ ves people like me a living ."
"It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a norm@@ al so@@ a@@ p oper@@ a to want : It &apos;s got love , jo@@ y , happ@@ iness , sa@@ d@@ ness , t@@ ear@@ s , l@@ aughter , lots of dec@@ e@@ it , in@@ tri@@ gu@@ e ."
"And like all good so@@ aps , it j@@ um@@ ps 20 years when the au@@ dience inter@@ est chang@@ es ."
And that &apos;s exactly what cr@@ ic@@ ket has done .
It &apos;s j@@ um@@ ped 20 years into 20@@ -@@ over g@@ ame .
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change le@@ ads to a very big re@@ vol@@ ution ."
But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
C@@ r@@ ic@@ ket wasn &apos;t always this spe@@ ed@@ -@@ dri@@ ven gener@@ ations g@@ ame .
"There was a time when you play@@ ed cr@@ ic@@ ket , you play@@ ed tim@@ el@@ ess test mat@@ ch@@ es , when you play@@ ed on ti@@ ll the g@@ ame got over ."
And there was this g@@ ame in Mar@@ ch 19@@ 3@@ 9 that started on the third of Mar@@ ch and en@@ ded on the 1@@ 4@@ th of Mar@@ ch .
"And it only en@@ ded because the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ters had to go from D@@ ur@@ b@@ an to C@@ ape T@@ own , which is a tw@@ o@@ -@@ h@@ our tra@@ in jour@@ ney , to c@@ at@@ ch the ship that left on the 1@@ 7@@ th , because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time ."
"So , the mat@@ ch was en@@ ded in between ."
"And one of the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh b@@ at@@ sm@@ en said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
A@@ no@@ ther half an h@@ our and we would have won . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A@@ no@@ ther half an h@@ our after 12 days .
"There were two S@@ und@@ ays in between . But of course , S@@ und@@ ays are ch@@ ur@@ ch days , so you don &apos;t play on S@@ und@@ ays . And one day it ra@@ ined , so they all s@@ at around making friends with each other ."
But there is a reason why India f@@ ell in love with cr@@ ic@@ ket : because we had about the same p@@ ace of life .
"( Laughter ) The M@@ a@@ ha@@ b@@ har@@ at@@ a was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?"
"You f@@ ou@@ ght by day , then it was s@@ un@@ set , so everyone went back home ."
"And then you worked out your str@@ ate@@ gy , and you came and f@@ ou@@ ght the next day , and you went back home again ."
"The only difference between the M@@ a@@ ha@@ b@@ har@@ at@@ a and our cr@@ ic@@ ket was that in cr@@ ic@@ ket , everybody was ali@@ ve to come back and fi@@ ght the next day ."
"P@@ r@@ in@@ ces pat@@ r@@ on@@ ize the g@@ ame , not because they love the g@@ ame , but because it was a means of ing@@ ra@@ ti@@ ating themselves to the B@@ ri@@ tis@@ h r@@ ul@@ ers ."
"But there is one other reason why India f@@ ell in love with cr@@ ic@@ ket , which was , all you needed was a pl@@ ank of w@@ ood and a ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ all , and any number of people could play it any@@ where ."
"T@@ ake a look : You could play it in the d@@ um@@ p with some ro@@ c@@ ks over there , you could play it in a little al@@ le@@ y — you couldn &apos;t h@@ it s@@ qu@@ are any@@ where , because the b@@ at h@@ it the w@@ all ; don &apos;t for@@ get the air con@@ di@@ tion@@ ing and the c@@ able wi@@ res ."
( Laughter ) You could play it on the ban@@ ks of the G@@ ang@@ es — that &apos;s as cle@@ an as the G@@ ang@@ es has been for a long time .
"O@@ r you could play many g@@ am@@ es in one small pat@@ ch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which g@@ ame you were actually in ."
"( Laughter ) A@@ s you can see , you can play any@@ where ."
"But s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly the g@@ ame mo@@ ved on , you know , finally ."
"You don &apos;t always have five days . So , we mo@@ ved on , and we started play@@ ing 5@@ 0-@@ over cr@@ ic@@ ket ."
And then an en@@ orm@@ ous ac@@ ci@@ dent took place .
"In In@@ di@@ an sp@@ ort we don &apos;t make things happen , ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes ."
And we won this W@@ or@@ ld C@@ up in 19@@ 8@@ 3 .
"And su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly we f@@ ell in love with the 5@@ 0-@@ over g@@ ame , and we play@@ ed it vir@@ tually every day ."
There was more 5@@ 0-@@ over cr@@ ic@@ ket than any@@ where .
But there was another big d@@ ate .
19@@ 8@@ 3 was when we won the W@@ or@@ ld C@@ up .
"@@ 199@@ 1 , &apos; 9@@ 2 , we found a fin@@ ance min@@ ist@@ er and a pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er w@@ ill@@ ing to let the world look at India , rather than be this great country of in@@ tri@@ gu@@ e and my@@ st@@ ery in this clos@@ ed country ."
And so we allo@@ wed mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tion@@ als into India .
"We c@@ ut cu@@ st@@ om@@ s du@@ ties , we re@@ duc@@ ed im@@ port du@@ ties , and we got all the mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tion@@ als coming in , with mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tional bu@@ d@@ gets , who looked at per@@ -@@ cap@@ it@@ a in@@ come and got very exc@@ ited about the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties in India , and were looking for a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le to re@@ ach every In@@ di@@ an ."
"And there are only two ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les in India — one real , one sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ted ."
"The sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ted one is what you see in the movi@@ es , the real one was cr@@ ic@@ ket ."
"And so one of my friends sit@@ ting right here in front of me , R@@ av@@ i D@@ h@@ ari@@ w@@ al from P@@ ep@@ s@@ i , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world ."
"And P@@ ep@@ s@@ i was this big re@@ vol@@ ution , because they started taking cr@@ ic@@ ket all over ."
And so cr@@ ic@@ ket started bec@@ om@@ ing big ; cr@@ ic@@ ket started br@@ ing@@ ing r@@ ic@@ h@@ es in .
"T@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion started co@@ ver@@ ing cr@@ ic@@ ket . F@@ or a long time t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion said , &quot; &quot; We won &apos;t co@@ ver cr@@ ic@@ ket un@@ less you p@@ ay us to co@@ ver it . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en they said , &quot; &quot; OK , the next ri@@ ghts are so@@ ld for 5@@ 5 million dollars ."
"The next ri@@ ghts are so@@ ld for 6@@ 12 million dollars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a cur@@ ve , that ."
And then another big ac@@ ci@@ dent happened in our cr@@ ic@@ ket .
"E@@ n@@ g@@ land inv@@ ented 20 over@@ s cr@@ ic@@ ket , and said , &quot; &quot; The world must play 20 over@@ s cr@@ ic@@ ket . &quot; &quot; J@@ ust as En@@ g@@ land inv@@ ented cr@@ ic@@ ket , and made the rest of the world play it ."
Thank G@@ od for them .
"( Laughter ) And so , India had to go and play the T@@ 20 W@@ or@@ ld C@@ up , you see ."
India didn &apos;t want to play the T@@ 20 W@@ or@@ ld C@@ up .
But we were for@@ c@@ ed to play it by an 8@@ -@@ 1 mar@@ g@@ in .
And then something very dra@@ ma@@ tic happened .
"We got to the fin@@ al , and then this moment , that will re@@ ma@@ in en@@ sh@@ r@@ ined fore@@ ver , for everybody , take a look ."
( C@@ ro@@ w@@ d che@@ ering ) The P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an@@ i b@@ at@@ sm@@ an trying to cle@@ ar the fiel@@ der .
An@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ er : And Z@@ i@@ sh@@ an takes it ! India w@@ ins !
What a mat@@ ch for a T@@ w@@ ent@@ y@@ 20 fin@@ al .
"I@@ n@@ dia , the world cha@@ m@@ pi@@ ons ."
"( C@@ he@@ ering ) India , T@@ 20 cha@@ m@@ pi@@ ons ."
"But what a g@@ ame we had , M@@ . S. D@@ h@@ on@@ i got it right in the air , but M@@ is@@ b@@ a@@ h@@ -@@ ul@@ -@@ H@@ a@@ q , what a play@@ er ."
"A m@@ as@@ sive , m@@ as@@ sive suc@@ cess : India , the world T@@ T cha@@ m@@ pi@@ ons ."
H@@ ar@@ sh@@ a B@@ ho@@ gle : S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly India disco@@ vered this power of 20@@ -@@ over@@ s cr@@ ic@@ ket .
"The ac@@ ci@@ dent , of course , there , was that the b@@ at@@ sm@@ an thought the bo@@ w@@ l@@ er was bo@@ w@@ ling f@@ ast ."
"( Laughter ) If he had bo@@ w@@ led f@@ ast , the b@@ all would have g@@ one where it was me@@ ant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly disco@@ vered that we could be good at this g@@ ame ."
And what it also did was it led to a cer@@ tain pri@@ de in the fact that India could be the best in the world .
"It was at a time when inv@@ est@@ ment was coming in , India was fe@@ eling a little more con@@ fi@@ dent about itself ."
And so there was a fe@@ eling that there was great pri@@ de in what we can do .
"And th@@ an@@ k@@ fully for all of us , the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh are very good at inv@@ en@@ ting things , and then the gr@@ ac@@ i@@ ous people that they are , they let the world become very good at it ."
"( Laughter ) And so En@@ g@@ land inv@@ ented T@@ 20 cr@@ ic@@ ket , and allo@@ wed India to hi@@ j@@ ack it ."
"It was not like re@@ engine@@ ering that we do in me@@ dic@@ ine , we just took it stra@@ ight away , as is ."
"( Laughter ) And so , we la@@ un@@ ched our own T@@ 20 le@@ ag@@ ue ."
"S@@ i@@ x wee@@ ks , city vers@@ us city ."
"It was a new thing for us . We had only ever sup@@ por@@ ted our country — the only two are@@ as in which India was very p@@ rou@@ d about their country , re@@ pres@@ en@@ ting itself on the fiel@@ d ."
"One was war , the In@@ di@@ an ar@@ my , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often ."
The other was In@@ di@@ an cr@@ ic@@ ket .
"Now , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly we had to sup@@ port city le@@ ag@@ ues ."
But the people getting into these city le@@ ag@@ ues were people who were taking their cu@@ es from the W@@ est .
"A@@ mer@@ ica is a home of le@@ ag@@ ues . And they said , &quot; Right , we &apos;ll build some g@@ lit@@ z@@ y le@@ ag@@ ues here in India . &quot;"
But was India ready for it ?
"Because cr@@ ic@@ ket , for a long time in India was always organ@@ ized ."
"It was never pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ed , it was never so@@ ld — it was organ@@ ized ."
"And look what they did with our beautiful , n@@ ice , simple family g@@ ame ."
"A@@ ll of a su@@ dd@@ en , you had that happening ."
( Mus@@ ic ) A@@ n op@@ ening cer@@ em@@ on@@ y to mat@@ ch every other .
This was an India that was bu@@ ying C@@ or@@ v@@ et@@ t@@ es . This was an India that was bu@@ ying J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar .
This was an India that was ad@@ ding more mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones per mon@@ th than New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and &apos;s population tw@@ ice over .
"So , it was a different India ."
"But it was also a sli@@ gh@@ tly more or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x India that was very happy to be mo@@ der@@ n , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people ."
"And so , they were ag@@ ha@@ st when the che@@ er@@ lead@@ ers ar@@ ri@@ ved ."
"E@@ very@@ one sec@@ re@@ tly wat@@ ched them , but everyone cl@@ a@@ im@@ ed not to ."
( Mus@@ ic ) ( Laughter ) The new o@@ w@@ n@@ ers of In@@ di@@ an cr@@ ic@@ ket were not the old prin@@ ces .
They were not bu@@ re@@ a@@ uc@@ r@@ ats who were for@@ c@@ ed into sp@@ ort because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who r@@ an ser@@ i@@ ous companies .
"And so they started pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing cr@@ ic@@ ket big time , started pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing clu@@ b@@ s big time ."
And they &apos;ve started pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing them with huge money behind it .
"I mean the I@@ P@@ L had 2@@ .@@ 3 billion dollars before a b@@ all was bo@@ w@@ led , 1@@ .@@ 6 billion dollars for t@@ ele@@ vi@@ sion re@@ ven@@ ue over 10 years , and another 7@@ 0 million dollars pl@@ us from all these fr@@ an@@ ch@@ is@@ es that were p@@ ut@@ ting in money . And then they had to appe@@ al to their cities , but they had to do it like the W@@ est , right ? Because we are se@@ tting up le@@ ag@@ ues ."
But what they were very good at doing was making it very loc@@ al@@ ized .
"So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not M@@ an@@ ch@@ est@@ er United st@@ y@@ le pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion , but very M@@ um@@ b@@ a@@ i st@@ y@@ le pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion . T@@ ake a look ."
"( Mus@@ ic ) O@@ f course , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ay@@ be they d@@ ance better than they play . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cr@@ ic@@ ket ."
"A@@ ll along , if you wanted a young cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ter , you pic@@ ked him up from the b@@ y@@ lan@@ es of your own little loc@@ ality , your own city , and you were very p@@ rou@@ d of the system that produc@@ ed those cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ters ."
"Now , all of the su@@ dd@@ en , if you were to bo@@ w@@ l a sho@@ t — if M@@ um@@ b@@ a@@ i were to bo@@ w@@ l a sho@@ t , for example , they nee@@ dn &apos;t go to K@@ al@@ b@@ a@@ dev@@ i or S@@ hi@@ v@@ a@@ j@@ i P@@ ar@@ k or some@@ where to sour@@ ce them , they could go to T@@ r@@ in@@ id@@ ad ."
"This was the new India , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can sour@@ ce from any@@ where as long as you get the best produc@@ t at the best pr@@ ice ."
"And all of a su@@ dd@@ en , In@@ di@@ an sp@@ ort had a@@ wa@@ k@@ en@@ ed to the reality that you can sour@@ ce the best produc@@ t for the best pr@@ ice any@@ where in the world ."
"So , the M@@ um@@ b@@ a@@ i In@@ di@@ ans f@@ le@@ w in D@@ w@@ ay@@ ne B@@ ra@@ v@@ o from T@@ r@@ in@@ id@@ ad and T@@ ob@@ ago , o@@ vern@@ ight . And when he had to go back to re@@ present the W@@ est In@@ dies , they asked him , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en do you have to re@@ ach ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I have to be there by a cer@@ tain time , so I have to leave today . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . It &apos;s not about when you have to leave ; it &apos;s about when do you have to re@@ ach there ? &quot; &quot; And so he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to re@@ ach on d@@ ate X@@ . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine , you play to d@@ ate X , min@@ us one . &quot; &quot; So , he play@@ ed in H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , went , stra@@ ight after the g@@ ame ,"
"@@ went from the sta@@ di@@ um to H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad air@@ port , s@@ at in a pri@@ v@@ ate cor@@ por@@ ate j@@ et — first re@@ fu@@ eling in P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al , second re@@ fu@@ eling in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il ; he was in W@@ est In@@ dies in time ."
( Laughter ) N@@ ever would India have thought on this scale before .
"N@@ ever would India have said , &quot; &quot; I want a play@@ er to play one g@@ ame for me , and I will use a cor@@ por@@ ate j@@ et to s@@ end him all the way back to K@@ ing@@ st@@ on , J@@ ama@@ ica to play a g@@ ame . &quot; &quot; And I just thought to myself , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , we &apos;ve ar@@ ri@@ ved some@@ where in the world , you know ?"
"We have ar@@ ri@@ ved some@@ where . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started mar@@ r@@ ying the two most important things in In@@ di@@ an cr@@ ic@@ ket , which is cr@@ ic@@ ket and the movi@@ es in In@@ di@@ an en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment ."
There is cr@@ ic@@ ket and the movi@@ es .
And they came together because people in the movi@@ es now started o@@ w@@ ning clu@@ b@@ s .
"And so , people started going to the cr@@ ic@@ ket to wat@@ ch P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a ."
They started going to the cr@@ ic@@ ket to wat@@ ch S@@ ha@@ h R@@ u@@ k@@ h K@@ h@@ an .
And something very interesting happened .
We started getting s@@ ong and d@@ ance in In@@ di@@ an cr@@ ic@@ ket .
And so it started re@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ ing the In@@ di@@ an movi@@ es more and more .
"And of course , if you were on P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a &apos;s team — as you will see on the c@@ li@@ p that fol@@ lo@@ ws — if you did well , you got a hu@@ g from P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a ."
So that was the ul@@ tim@@ ate reason to do well . T@@ ake a look — everyone &apos;s wat@@ ching P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a .
( Mus@@ ic ) And then of course there was S@@ ha@@ h R@@ u@@ k@@ h play@@ ing the K@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d .
"We &apos;d all seen mat@@ ch@@ es in K@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : S@@ ha@@ h R@@ u@@ k@@ h , with the B@@ eng@@ al@@ i s@@ ong , getting the au@@ di@@ ences all worked up for K@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a — not for India , but for K@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a ."
But take a look at this .
( Mus@@ ic ) A@@ n In@@ di@@ an fil@@ m st@@ ar hu@@ gg@@ ing a P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an@@ i cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ter because they &apos;d won in K@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a .
C@@ an you imagine ?
And do you know what the P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an@@ i cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ter said ?
( Applause ) &quot; I w@@ ish I was play@@ ing for P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a &apos;s team . &quot;
( Laughter ) But I thought I &apos;d take this opport@@ un@@ ity — there &apos;s a few people from P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an in here .
"I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?"
"We can play cr@@ ic@@ ket together , we can be friends ."
"So th@@ ank you very much for coming , all of you from P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"( Applause ) There was cri@@ tici@@ s@@ m too because they said , &quot; &quot; P@@ l@@ ay@@ ers are being b@@ ou@@ ght and so@@ ld ?"
A@@ re they gra@@ in ?
"A@@ re they c@@ at@@ tle ? &quot; &quot; Because we had this a@@ uc@@ tion , you see ."
How do you fi@@ x a pr@@ ice for a play@@ er ?
"And so the a@@ uc@@ tion that fol@@ lo@@ wed liter@@ ally had people saying , &quot; B@@ an@@ g ! so many million dollars for so@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ so play@@ er . &quot;"
There it is .
"( Mus@@ ic ) A@@ uc@@ tion@@ e@@ er : G@@ o@@ ing at 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars . Ch@@ en@@ na@@ i ."
"S@@ h@@ an@@ e W@@ ar@@ ne so@@ ld for 4@@ 5@@ 0,000 dollars ."
"H@@ B : S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , a g@@ ame which ear@@ ned its play@@ ers 50 ru@@ pe@@ es a day — so 2@@ 50 ru@@ pe@@ es for a test mat@@ ch , but if you fin@@ ish in four days you only got 2@@ 00 ."
"The best In@@ di@@ an play@@ ers who play@@ ed every test mat@@ ch — every one of the inter@@ na@@ tion@@ als , the top of the line play@@ ers — st@@ and@@ ard con@@ trac@@ ts are 2@@ 20@@ ,000 dollars in a whole year ."
"Now they were getting 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 for six days &apos; work ."
"Th@@ en An@@ dre@@ w F@@ l@@ in@@ to@@ ff came by from En@@ g@@ land , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or four wee@@ ks , I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than F@@ r@@ ank L@@ am@@ par@@ d and St@@ even G@@ er@@ r@@ ard , and I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than the fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all@@ ers , w@@ ow . &quot; &quot; And where was he ear@@ ning it from ? F@@ rom a little clu@@ b in India ."
C@@ ould you have imag@@ ined that day would come ?
One and a half million dollars for six wee@@ ks &apos; work .
"That &apos;s not bad , is it ?"
"So , at 2@@ .@@ 3 billion dollars before the first b@@ all was bo@@ w@@ led ."
"What India was doing , though , was b@@ en@@ ch@@ mar@@ king itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge br@@ and ."
L@@ al@@ it M@@ o@@ d@@ i was on the co@@ ver of B@@ us@@ iness T@@ o@@ day .
"I@@ P@@ L became the bi@@ gg@@ est br@@ and in India and , because our elec@@ tions , had to be mo@@ ved to S@@ outh Africa , and we had to start the t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent in three wee@@ ks ."
M@@ o@@ ve a whole t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent to S@@ outh Africa in three wee@@ ks .
But we did it . You know why ?
"Because no country works as s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly as we do ti@@ ll three wee@@ ks before an ev@@ ent , and no@@ body works f@@ ast as we do in the last three wee@@ ks ."
"( Applause ) O@@ ur population , which for a long time we thought was a problem , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly became our bi@@ gg@@ est as@@ set because there were more people wat@@ ching — the huge con@@ sum@@ ing cl@@ ass — everybody came to wat@@ ch the cr@@ ic@@ ket ."
"We &apos;d also made cr@@ ic@@ ket the only sp@@ ort in India , which is a p@@ ity , but in India every other sp@@ ort p@@ us@@ h@@ es cr@@ ic@@ ket to become big , which is a bit of a tra@@ ge@@ dy of our times ."
"Now , this last minut@@ e before I go — there &apos;s a couple of side effec@@ ts of all this ."
"For a long time , India was this country of po@@ ver@@ ty , d@@ ust , beg@@ g@@ ar@@ s , s@@ na@@ ke char@@ m@@ ers , fil@@ th , D@@ el@@ h@@ i b@@ el@@ ly — people heard D@@ el@@ h@@ i b@@ el@@ ly stories before they came ."
"And , all of a su@@ dd@@ en , India was this land of opport@@ un@@ ity ."
"C@@ r@@ ic@@ ke@@ ters all over the world said , &quot; You know , we love India . We love to play in India . &quot;"
"And that felt good , you know ?"
"We said , &quot; &quot; The dol@@ l@@ ar &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot; &quot; C@@ an you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dol@@ l@@ ar on view and there &apos;s no D@@ el@@ h@@ i b@@ el@@ ly in there any@@ more ."
"There &apos;s no fil@@ th , there &apos;s no beg@@ g@@ ar@@ s , all the s@@ na@@ ke char@@ m@@ ers have v@@ an@@ i@@ shed , everybody &apos;s g@@ one . This t@@ ells you how the cap@@ it@@ al@@ ist world r@@ ules ."
"@@ Right so , finally , an En@@ g@@ li@@ sh g@@ ame that India us@@ ur@@ ped a little bit , but T@@ 20 is going to be the next mis@@ sion@@ ary in the world ."
"If you want to take the g@@ ame around the world , it &apos;s got to be the sh@@ or@@ test form of the g@@ ame ."
"You can &apos;t take a tim@@ el@@ ess test to China and s@@ it through 1@@ 4 days with no res@@ ult in the end , or you can &apos;t take it all over the world ."
So that &apos;s what T@@ 20 is doing .
"H@@ op@@ e@@ fully , it &apos;ll make everyone r@@ ic@@ her , hop@@ e@@ fully it &apos;ll make the g@@ ame bi@@ g@@ ger and hop@@ e@@ fully it &apos;ll give cr@@ ic@@ ket comm@@ ent@@ at@@ ors more time in the business ."
Thank you very much . Thank you .
( Applause )
"So , imagine you &apos;re st@@ anding on a stre@@ et any@@ where in America and a J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese man comes up to you and says , &quot; E@@ x@@ c@@ use me , what is the name of this b@@ loc@@ k ? &quot;"

"They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s B@@ loc@@ k 1@@ 7 and this is B@@ loc@@ k 1@@ 6 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this stre@@ et ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , stre@@ ets don &apos;t have nam@@ es ."
B@@ loc@@ ks have nam@@ es .
"@@ J@@ ust look at Google M@@ aps here . There &apos;s B@@ loc@@ k 1@@ 4 , 15 , 1@@ 6 , 1@@ 7 , 1@@ 8 , 1@@ 9 ."

"There &apos;s B@@ loc@@ k 1@@ 7 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but wal@@ king around the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood , I no@@ tic@@ ed that the house num@@ bers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ f course they do .

The first house ever built on a b@@ loc@@ k is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
"Th@@ ird is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvi@@ ous . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the op@@ pos@@ ite side of the world to real@@ ize ass@@ um@@ p@@ tions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and real@@ ize that the op@@ pos@@ ite of them may also be true ."
"So , for example , there are doc@@ tors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you heal@@ thy ."
"So , any mon@@ th you are heal@@ thy you p@@ ay them , and when you &apos;re s@@ ick you don &apos;t have to p@@ ay them because they fa@@ il@@ ed at their job . They get r@@ ich when you &apos;re heal@@ thy , not s@@ ick ."
"( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the do@@ w@@ n@@ be@@ at , the beginning of the mus@@ ical ph@@ r@@ ase : one , two , three , four ."
"But in W@@ est Afr@@ ican music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the ph@@ r@@ ase , like the per@@ i@@ od at the end of a s@@ ent@@ ence ."
"So , you can hear it not just in the ph@@ r@@ as@@ ing , but the way they coun@@ t off their music : two , three , four , one ."
And this ma@@ p is also ac@@ cur@@ ate .
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that what@@ ever true thing you can say about India , the op@@ pos@@ ite is also true ."
"So , let &apos;s never for@@ get , whether at TED , or any@@ where else , that what@@ ever br@@ illi@@ ant ideas you have or hear , that the op@@ pos@@ ite may also be true ."
D@@ om@@ o ar@@ ig@@ a@@ to go@@ z@@ a@@ im@@ ash@@ it@@ a .
"So I started working with re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es because I wanted to make a difference , and making a difference star@@ ts with t@@ elling their stories ."
"So when I me@@ et re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , I always ask them questions ."
Wh@@ o b@@ om@@ bed your house ?
Wh@@ o kill@@ ed your son ?
D@@ id the rest of your family make it out ali@@ ve ?
How are you cop@@ ing in your life in ex@@ ile ?
"But there &apos;s one question that always se@@ ems to me to be most re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing , and that is : What did you take ?"
"What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the b@@ om@@ b@@ s were exp@@ lo@@ ding in your to@@ wn , and the ar@@ m@@ ed g@@ an@@ gs were appro@@ ach@@ ing your house ?"
A S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e bo@@ y I know told me that he didn &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate when his life was in im@@ min@@ ent d@@ an@@ ger .
"He took his high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a , and later he told me why ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I took my high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a because my life dep@@ en@@ ded on it . &quot; &quot; And he would ris@@ k his life to get that di@@ pl@@ om@@ a ."
"O@@ n his way to school , he would do@@ dge s@@ ni@@ per@@ s ."
"H@@ is cl@@ ass@@ room sometimes sh@@ ook with the sound of b@@ om@@ b@@ s and sh@@ elling , and his mother told me , &quot; &quot; E@@ very day , I would say to him every mor@@ ning , &apos; H@@ on@@ ey , ple@@ ase don &apos;t go to school . &apos; &quot; &quot; And when he in@@ si@@ st@@ ed , she said , &quot; I would hu@@ g him as if it were for the last time . &quot;"
"But he said to his mother , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re all af@@ ra@@ id , but our de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation to gra@@ du@@ ate is str@@ on@@ ger than our fe@@ ar . &quot; &quot; But one day , the family got ter@@ ri@@ ble news ."
"H@@ any &apos;s a@@ un@@ t , his un@@ cle and his c@@ ous@@ in were m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in their h@@ omes for re@@ f@@ using to leave their house ."
Th@@ e@@ ir th@@ ro@@ ats were s@@ l@@ it .
It was time to f@@ le@@ e .
"They left that day , right away , in their car , H@@ any hi@@ dd@@ en in the back because they were fac@@ ing ch@@ ec@@ k@@ poin@@ ts of men@@ ac@@ ing sol@@ di@@ ers ."
"And they would cr@@ oss the bor@@ der into L@@ e@@ ban@@ on , where they would find pe@@ ace ."
But they would beg@@ in a life of gr@@ u@@ eling har@@ d@@ ship and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y .
"They had no cho@@ ice but to build a sh@@ ack on the side of a m@@ u@@ d@@ dy fiel@@ d , and this is H@@ any &apos;s bro@@ ther A@@ sh@@ ra@@ f , who pl@@ ays outside ."
"And that day , they jo@@ ined the bi@@ gg@@ est population of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es in the world , in a country , L@@ e@@ ban@@ on , that is tin@@ y ."
"It only has four million ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , and there are one million S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es living there ."
"There &apos;s not a to@@ wn , a city or a v@@ ill@@ age that is not h@@ ost to S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
This is gener@@ os@@ ity and hum@@ an@@ ity that is re@@ mar@@ k@@ able .
"Th@@ ink about it this way , pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately ."
"It would be as if the entire population of G@@ er@@ many , 80 million people , would f@@ le@@ e to the United States in just three years ."
"H@@ al@@ f of the entire population of S@@ y@@ ri@@ a is now u@@ pro@@ ot@@ ed , most of them inside the country ."
S@@ i@@ x and a half million people have fl@@ ed for their lives .
"O@@ ver and well over three million people have cr@@ os@@ sed the bor@@ d@@ ers and have found s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing countries , and only a small pro@@ por@@ tion , as you see , have mo@@ ved on to Eu@@ rop@@ e ."
What I find most wor@@ r@@ ying is that half of all S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es are children .
I took this picture of this little girl .
It was just two hours after she had ar@@ ri@@ ved after a long tre@@ k from S@@ y@@ ri@@ a into J@@ ord@@ an .
And most tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ing of all is that only 20 percent of S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children are in school in L@@ e@@ ban@@ on .
"And yet , S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children , all re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives ."
Why ? Because it allo@@ ws them to think of their future rather than the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are of their past .
It allo@@ ws them to think of hope rather than h@@ at@@ red .
"I &apos;m re@@ min@@ ded of a rec@@ ent vi@@ s@@ it I took to a S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p in n@@ or@@ ther@@ n I@@ ra@@ q , and I met this girl , and I thought , &quot; &quot; She &apos;s beautiful , &quot; &quot; and I went up to her and asked her , &quot; C@@ an I take your picture ? &quot;"
"And she said y@@ es , but she re@@ f@@ used to sm@@ ile ."
"I think she couldn &apos;t , because I think she must real@@ ize that she re@@ pres@@ ents a l@@ ost gener@@ ation of S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children , a gener@@ ation is@@ ol@@ ated and f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated ."
"And yet , look at what they fl@@ ed : ut@@ ter de@@ struc@@ tion , buil@@ d@@ ings , indu@@ stri@@ es , s@@ cho@@ ols , ro@@ ads , h@@ omes ."
H@@ any &apos;s home was also de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed .
"This will need to be re@@ built by arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts , by engine@@ ers , by electr@@ ici@@ ans ."
C@@ om@@ m@@ uni@@ ties will need te@@ ach@@ ers and la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and poli@@ tici@@ ans interest@@ ed in re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation and not re@@ ven@@ ge .
"S@@ h@@ ouldn &apos;t this be re@@ built by the people with the lar@@ g@@ est sta@@ ke , the soci@@ e@@ ties in ex@@ ile , the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ?"
Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es have a lot of time to pre@@ p@@ are for their re@@ turn .
You might imagine that being a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e is just a tem@@ por@@ ary state .
Well far from it .
"W@@ ith war@@ s going on and on , the a@@ ver@@ age time a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e will sp@@ end in ex@@ ile is 1@@ 7 years ."
"H@@ any was into his second year in lim@@ b@@ o when I went to vi@@ s@@ it him rec@@ ently , and we con@@ duc@@ ted our entire conver@@ sa@@ tion in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , which he conf@@ ess@@ ed to me he learned from read@@ ing all of D@@ an B@@ ro@@ wn &apos;s nov@@ els and from list@@ ening to American ra@@ p ."
We also sp@@ ent some n@@ ice mom@@ ents of l@@ aughter and fu@@ n with his b@@ el@@ o@@ ved bro@@ ther A@@ sh@@ ra@@ f .
But I &apos;ll never for@@ get what he told me when we en@@ ded our conver@@ sa@@ tion that day .
"He said to me , &quot; If I am not a stud@@ ent , I am nothing . &quot;"
H@@ any is one of 50 million people u@@ pro@@ ot@@ ed in this world today .
N@@ ever since W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I have so many people been for@@ ci@@ bly dis@@ plac@@ ed .
"So while we &apos;re making s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing pro@@ gre@@ ss in human health , in technology , in education and design , we are doing d@@ ang@@ er@@ ously little to help the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms and we are doing far too little to stop and pre@@ v@@ ent the war@@ s that are dri@@ ving them from their h@@ omes ."
And there are more and more v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms .
"E@@ very day , on a@@ ver@@ age , by the end of this day , 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people will be for@@ ci@@ bly dis@@ plac@@ ed from their h@@ omes — 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people ."
They f@@ le@@ e across bor@@ d@@ ers like this one .
"We cap@@ tu@@ red this on the S@@ y@@ ri@@ an bor@@ der to J@@ ord@@ an , and this is a typ@@ ical day ."
"O@@ r they f@@ le@@ e on un@@ se@@ a@@ wor@@ thy and over@@ c@@ ro@@ w@@ ded bo@@ ats , ris@@ king their lives in this case just to re@@ ach sa@@ fe@@ ty in Eu@@ rop@@ e ."
"This S@@ y@@ ri@@ an young man survi@@ ved one of these bo@@ ats that cap@@ si@@ z@@ ed — most of the people dro@@ w@@ ned — and he told us , &quot; &quot; S@@ y@@ ri@@ ans are just looking for a qui@@ et place where no@@ body h@@ ur@@ ts you , where no@@ body hum@@ ili@@ ates you , and where no@@ body kill@@ s you . &quot; &quot; Well , I think that should be the min@@ im@@ um ."
"@@ How about a place of heal@@ ing , of learning , and even opport@@ un@@ ity ?"
"A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans and Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans have the im@@ pres@@ sion that pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ally huge num@@ bers of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es are coming to their country , but the reality is that 8@@ 6 percent , the v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , are living in the develop@@ ing world , in countries str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with their own in@@ sec@@ ur@@ ity , with their own issu@@ es of hel@@ ping their own pop@@ ul@@ ations and po@@ ver@@ ty ."
So we@@ al@@ thy countries in the world should reco@@ gn@@ ize the hum@@ an@@ ity and the gener@@ os@@ ity of the countries that are h@@ os@@ ting so many re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
And all countries should make sure that no one f@@ le@@ e@@ ing war and per@@ sec@@ ution ar@@ ri@@ ves at a clos@@ ed bor@@ der .
( Applause ) Thank you .
But there is something more that we can do than just sim@@ ply hel@@ ping re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es survi@@ ve .
We can help them th@@ ri@@ ve .
We should think of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps and comm@@ uni@@ ties as more than just tem@@ por@@ ary population cen@@ ters where people langu@@ ish wa@@ iting for the war to end .
"@@ R@@ a@@ ther , as cen@@ ters of exc@@ ell@@ ence , where re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es can tri@@ um@@ p@@ h over their tra@@ um@@ a and tra@@ in for the day that they can go home as ag@@ ents of posi@@ tive change and social trans@@ for@@ mation ."
"It makes so much sense , but I &apos;m re@@ min@@ ded of the ter@@ ri@@ ble war in S@@ om@@ al@@ ia that has been ra@@ g@@ ing on for 2@@ 2 years ."
And imagine living in this cam@@ p .
I vi@@ s@@ ited this cam@@ p .
"It &apos;s in D@@ j@@ i@@ b@@ out@@ i , ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing S@@ om@@ al@@ ia , and it was so re@@ m@@ ote that we had to take a he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter to f@@ ly there ."
It was du@@ st@@ y and it was ter@@ ri@@ bly h@@ ot .
"And we went to vi@@ s@@ it a school and started talking to the children , and then I saw this girl across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own d@@ aughter , and I went up and tal@@ ked to her ."
"And I asked her the questions that grow@@ n@@ -@@ u@@ ps ask kids , like , &quot; &quot; What is your fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite sub@@ ject ? &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; What do you want to be when you gro@@ w up ? &quot; &quot; And this is when her face turned bl@@ ank , and she said to me , &quot; &quot; I have no future ."
"M@@ y s@@ cho@@ ol@@ ing days are over . &quot; &quot; And I thought , there must be some mis@@ underst@@ anding , so I turned to my col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue and she con@@ fir@@ m@@ ed to me there is no fund@@ ing for secon@@ d@@ ary education in this cam@@ p ."
"And how I wi@@ shed at that moment that I could say to her , &quot; We will build you a school . &quot;"
"And I also thought , what a wa@@ st@@ e ."
She should be and she is the future of S@@ om@@ al@@ ia .
"A bo@@ y nam@@ ed J@@ ac@@ o@@ b A@@ te@@ m had a different chan@@ ce , but not before he experi@@ enc@@ ed ter@@ ri@@ bly tra@@ ge@@ dy ."
"He wat@@ ched — this is in S@@ u@@ d@@ an — as his v@@ ill@@ age — he was only se@@ ven years old — bur@@ ned to the ground , and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family were kill@@ ed that day ."
"O@@ n@@ ly his c@@ ous@@ in survi@@ ved , and the two of them wal@@ ked for se@@ ven months — this is bo@@ ys like him — cha@@ sed and pur@@ su@@ ed by w@@ il@@ d animals and ar@@ m@@ ed g@@ an@@ gs , and they finally made it to re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps where they found sa@@ fe@@ ty , and he would sp@@ end the next se@@ ven years in K@@ en@@ y@@ a in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p ."
"But his life changed when he got the chan@@ ce to be re@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ led to the United States , and he found love in a f@@ os@@ ter family and he was able to go to school , and he wanted me to share with you this p@@ rou@@ d moment when he gra@@ du@@ ated from uni@@ versity ."
"( Applause ) I sp@@ o@@ ke to him on S@@ k@@ yp@@ e the other day , and he was in his new uni@@ versity in F@@ l@@ or@@ id@@ a pur@@ su@@ ing his P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . in public health , and he p@@ rou@@ d@@ ly told me how he was able to ra@@ ise enough fun@@ ds from the American public to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh a health cl@@ in@@ ic back in his v@@ ill@@ age back home ."
So I want to take you back to H@@ any .
"When I told him I was going to have the chan@@ ce to spe@@ ak to you here on the TED st@@ age , he allo@@ wed me to read you a po@@ e@@ m that he s@@ ent in an e@@ ma@@ il to me ."
"He wr@@ ote : &quot; &quot; I mis@@ s myself , my friends , times of read@@ ing nov@@ els or wr@@ iting po@@ ems , b@@ ir@@ ds and te@@ a in the mor@@ ning ."
"M@@ y room , my bo@@ o@@ ks , myself , and everything that was making me sm@@ ile ."
"O@@ h , o@@ h , I had so many dre@@ am@@ s that were about to be real@@ ized . &quot; &quot; So here is my point : N@@ ot inv@@ est@@ ing in re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es is a huge mis@@ sed opport@@ un@@ ity ."
"L@@ e@@ ave them ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed , and they ris@@ k exp@@ lo@@ it@@ ation and ab@@ use , and leave them un@@ sk@@ ill@@ ed and un@@ educ@@ ated , and d@@ el@@ ay by years the re@@ turn to pe@@ ace and pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity in their countries ."
I believe how we tre@@ at the u@@ pro@@ ot@@ ed will sh@@ ape the future of our world .
"The v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of war can h@@ old the ke@@ ys to la@@ st@@ ing pe@@ ace , and it &apos;s the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es who can stop the c@@ y@@ cle of viol@@ ence ."
H@@ any is at a ti@@ p@@ ping point .
"We would love to help him go to uni@@ versity and to become an engine@@ er , but our fun@@ ds are pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ed for the bas@@ ics in life : t@@ ents and bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ts and mat@@ tre@@ s@@ ses and k@@ it@@ ch@@ en se@@ ts , food ra@@ tions and a bit of me@@ dic@@ ine ."
U@@ ni@@ versity is a l@@ u@@ x@@ ury .

"B@@ e@@ li@@ eve me or not , I come off@@ ering a sol@@ ution to a very important part of this lar@@ ger problem , with the re@@ qu@@ is@@ ite foc@@ us on clim@@ ate ."
"And the sol@@ ution I off@@ er is to the bi@@ gg@@ est cul@@ pr@@ it in this m@@ as@@ sive m@@ ist@@ re@@ at@@ ment of the ear@@ th by hum@@ an@@ kind , and the res@@ ul@@ ting dec@@ line of the bi@@ osp@@ here ."
"That cul@@ pr@@ it is business and indu@@ stry , which happens to be where I have sp@@ ent the last 5@@ 2 years since my gra@@ du@@ ation from G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a T@@ ec@@ h in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"As an indu@@ stri@@ al engine@@ er , c@@ um as@@ p@@ ir@@ ing and then suc@@ cess@@ ful ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur ."
"A@@ f@@ ter f@@ oun@@ ding my company , Inter@@ face , from sc@@ r@@ at@@ ch in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , 3@@ 6 years ago , to pro@@ duce car@@ pe@@ t ti@@ les in America for the business and institu@@ tion mar@@ ke@@ ts , and sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ ding it through star@@ t-@@ up and survi@@ v@@ al to pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity and global d@@ om@@ in@@ ance in its fiel@@ d , I read P@@ au@@ l H@@ aw@@ ken &apos;s book , &quot; The E@@ co@@ logy of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce , &quot; the sum@@ m@@ er of 199@@ 4 ."
"In his book , P@@ au@@ l char@@ g@@ es business and indu@@ stry as , one , the maj@@ or cul@@ pr@@ it in ca@@ using the dec@@ line of the bi@@ osp@@ here , and , two , the only institu@@ tion that is large enough , and per@@ v@@ as@@ ive enough , and powerful enough , to really le@@ ad hum@@ an@@ kind out of this m@@ ess ."
And by the way he con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted me as a pl@@ under@@ er of the ear@@ th .
"And I then chall@@ eng@@ ed the people of Inter@@ face , my company , to le@@ ad our company and the entire indu@@ stri@@ al world to su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability , which we de@@ fin@@ ed as ev@@ en@@ tually oper@@ ating our pe@@ t@@ ro@@ le@@ um@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive company in such a way as to take from the ear@@ th only what can be r@@ ene@@ wed by the ear@@ th , nat@@ ur@@ ally and r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly — not another f@@ res@@ h dro@@ p of oil — and to do no har@@ m to the bi@@ osp@@ here ."
T@@ ake nothing : do no har@@ m .
"I sim@@ ply said , &quot; &quot; If H@@ aw@@ ken is right and business and indu@@ stry must le@@ ad , who will le@@ ad business and indu@@ stry ?"
"@@ Un@@ less somebody le@@ ads , no@@ body will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a@@ x@@ i@@ om@@ a@@ tic . Why not us ?"
"And th@@ an@@ ks to the people of Inter@@ face , I have become a reco@@ ver@@ ing pl@@ under@@ er ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a F@@ or@@ tun@@ e M@@ ag@@ a@@ z@@ ine writ@@ er that some@@ day people like me would go to j@@ a@@ il .
And that became the he@@ ad@@ line of a F@@ or@@ tun@@ e ar@@ tic@@ le .
They went on to des@@ cri@@ be me as America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O .
"F@@ rom pl@@ under@@ er to reco@@ ver@@ ing pl@@ under@@ er , to America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O in five years — that , fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly , was a pretty sa@@ d comm@@ ent@@ ary on American C@@ E@@ O@@ s in 199@@ 9 ."
"A@@ s@@ ked later in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary , &quot; &quot; The C@@ or@@ por@@ ation , &quot; &quot; what I me@@ ant by the &quot; &quot; go to j@@ a@@ il &quot; &quot; re@@ mar@@ k , I off@@ er@@ ed that the@@ ft is a cri@@ me ."
And the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future would some@@ day be a cri@@ me .
"But I real@@ ized , for that to be true — for the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future to be a cri@@ me — there must be a cle@@ ar , de@@ mon@@ str@@ able al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive to the ta@@ ke@@ -@@ ma@@ ke@@ -@@ wa@@ st@@ e indu@@ stri@@ al system that so d@@ om@@ in@@ ates our civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , and is the maj@@ or cul@@ pr@@ it , ste@@ al@@ ing our children &apos;s future , by di@@ gg@@ ing up the ear@@ th and conver@@ ting it to produc@@ ts that quickly become wa@@ st@@ e in a l@@ and@@ f@@ ill or an inc@@ in@@ er@@ ator — in sh@@ ort , di@@ gg@@ ing up the ear@@ th and conver@@ ting it to pol@@ l@@ ution ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch and a w@@ ell@@ -@@ known environ@@ m@@ ental imp@@ act equ@@ ation , imp@@ act — a bad thing — is the produc@@ t of population , aff@@ l@@ u@@ ence and technology ."
"That is , imp@@ act is gener@@ ated by people , what they con@@ su@@ me in their aff@@ l@@ u@@ ence , and how it is produc@@ ed ."
"And though the equ@@ ation is lar@@ ge@@ ly sub@@ jec@@ tive , you can perhaps qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y people , and perhaps qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y aff@@ l@@ u@@ ence , but technology is ab@@ us@@ ive in too many ways to qu@@ anti@@ f@@ y ."
So the equ@@ ation is con@@ cep@@ tual .
S@@ ti@@ ll it works to help us understand the problem .
"So we set out at Inter@@ face , in 199@@ 4 , to create an example : to trans@@ form the way we made car@@ pe@@ t , a pe@@ t@@ ro@@ le@@ um@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive produc@@ t for materi@@ als as well as energy , and to trans@@ form our techno@@ logi@@ es so they di@@ min@@ i@@ shed environ@@ m@@ ental imp@@ act , rather than mul@@ ti@@ p@@ li@@ ed it ."
"P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch &apos;s environ@@ m@@ ental imp@@ act equ@@ ation : I is equ@@ al to P times A times T : population , aff@@ l@@ u@@ ence and technology ."
I wanted Inter@@ face to re@@ wr@@ ite that equ@@ ation so that it read I equ@@ als P times A divi@@ ded by T@@ .
"Now , the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tic@@ all@@ y-@@ min@@ ded will see im@@ medi@@ ately that T in the num@@ er@@ ator incre@@ ases imp@@ act — a bad thing — but T in the d@@ en@@ om@@ in@@ ator dec@@ reas@@ es imp@@ act ."
"So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the num@@ er@@ ator — call it T@@ 1 — where it incre@@ ases imp@@ act , to the d@@ en@@ om@@ in@@ ator — call it T@@ 2 — where it re@@ duc@@ es imp@@ act ?"
"I thought about the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of first indu@@ stri@@ al re@@ vol@@ ution , T@@ 1 , as we pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed it at Inter@@ face , and it had the fol@@ lo@@ wing char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics ."
E@@ x@@ trac@@ tive : taking ra@@ w materi@@ als from the ear@@ th .
"L@@ ine@@ ar : take , make , wa@@ st@@ e ."
P@@ o@@ wer@@ ed by f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ el@@ -@@ der@@ i@@ ved energy .
W@@ a@@ ste@@ ful : ab@@ us@@ ive and foc@@ used on l@@ ab@@ or produc@@ tivity .
M@@ ore car@@ pe@@ t per man@@ -@@ h@@ our .
"Th@@ in@@ king it through , I real@@ ized that all those at@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ es must be changed to move T to the d@@ en@@ om@@ in@@ ator ."
"In the new indu@@ stri@@ al re@@ vol@@ ution ex@@ trac@@ tive must be re@@ plac@@ ed by r@@ ene@@ w@@ able ; l@@ ine@@ ar by c@@ y@@ c@@ lic@@ al ; f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ el energy by r@@ ene@@ w@@ able energy , s@@ un@@ light ; wa@@ ste@@ ful by wa@@ ste@@ -@@ free ; and ab@@ us@@ ive by b@@ en@@ ig@@ n ; and l@@ ab@@ or produc@@ tivity by res@@ our@@ ce produc@@ tivity ."
"And I reas@@ on@@ ed that if we could make those trans@@ for@@ ma@@ tive chang@@ es , and get ri@@ d of T@@ 1 al@@ together , we could re@@ duce our imp@@ act to z@@ er@@ o , inclu@@ ding our imp@@ act on the clim@@ ate ."
"And that became the Inter@@ face pl@@ an in 199@@ 5 , and has been the pl@@ an ever since ."
We have meas@@ u@@ red our pro@@ gre@@ ss very ri@@ g@@ or@@ ously .
So I can tell you how far we have come in the en@@ su@@ ing 12 years .
N@@ et gre@@ en@@ house g@@ as em@@ is@@ sions down 8@@ 2 percent in ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ e t@@ on@@ n@@ age .
( Applause ) O@@ ver the same sp@@ an of time s@@ al@@ es have incre@@ as@@ ed by tw@@ o@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ ds and prof@@ its have d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed .
So an 8@@ 2 percent ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ e re@@ duc@@ tion trans@@ l@@ ates into a 9@@ 0 percent re@@ duc@@ tion in gre@@ en@@ house g@@ as in@@ ten@@ s@@ ity rela@@ tive to s@@ al@@ es .
This is the mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de of the re@@ duc@@ tion the entire global tech@@ n@@ osp@@ here must real@@ ize by 20@@ 50 to av@@ o@@ id c@@ at@@ ast@@ rop@@ hi@@ c clim@@ ate dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tion — so the scienti@@ sts are t@@ elling us .
"F@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ el us@@ age is down 60 percent per un@@ it of produc@@ tion , du@@ e to eff@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es in r@@ ene@@ w@@ ab@@ les ."
"The che@@ ap@@ est , most sec@@ ure bar@@ re@@ l of oil there is is the one not used through eff@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
W@@ ater us@@ age is down 7@@ 5 percent in our wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de car@@ pe@@ t ti@@ le business .
"D@@ own 40 percent in our bro@@ ad@@ loo@@ m car@@ pe@@ t business , which we ac@@ qui@@ red in 199@@ 3 right here in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , C@@ ity of In@@ du@@ stry , where water is so pre@@ ci@@ ous ."
"@@ R@@ ene@@ w@@ able or rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able materi@@ als are 25 percent of the t@@ ot@@ al , and gro@@ wing r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly ."
"@@ R@@ ene@@ w@@ able energy is 2@@ 7 percent of our t@@ ot@@ al , going for 100 percent ."
"We have di@@ ver@@ ted 1@@ 4@@ 8 million p@@ ounds — that &apos;s 7@@ 4@@ ,000 t@@ ons — of used car@@ pe@@ t from l@@ and@@ f@@ ill@@ s , clos@@ ing the loo@@ p on materi@@ al flo@@ ws through re@@ verse log@@ is@@ tics and pos@@ t-@@ con@@ sum@@ er rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing techno@@ logi@@ es that did not ex@@ ist when we started 1@@ 4 years ago ."
"Th@@ ose new c@@ y@@ c@@ lic@@ al techno@@ logi@@ es have con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly to the fact that we have produc@@ ed and so@@ ld 8@@ 5 million s@@ qu@@ are y@@ ar@@ ds of c@@ li@@ mat@@ e-@@ ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al car@@ pe@@ t since 200@@ 4 , me@@ an@@ ing no net con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to global clim@@ ate dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tion in produc@@ ing the car@@ pe@@ t throu@@ gh@@ out the sup@@ ply cha@@ in , from m@@ ine and well head cle@@ ar to end@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ life re@@ cl@@ a@@ mation — in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent th@@ ir@@ d@@ -@@ par@@ ty cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed ."
We call it C@@ ool C@@ ar@@ pe@@ t .
"And it has been a powerful mar@@ ke@@ t@@ place differ@@ enti@@ ator , incre@@ as@@ ing s@@ al@@ es and prof@@ its ."
"Th@@ ree years ago we la@@ un@@ ched car@@ pe@@ t ti@@ le for the home , under the br@@ and F@@ l@@ or , mis@@ sp@@ ell@@ ed F@@ -@@ L@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ R ."
You can point and c@@ lic@@ k today at F@@ l@@ or@@ .@@ co@@ m and have C@@ ool C@@ ar@@ pe@@ t deli@@ vered to your front do@@ or in five days .
"It is pr@@ ac@@ tical , and pretty too ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We rec@@ k@@ on that we are a bit over hal@@ f@@ way to our go@@ al : z@@ er@@ o imp@@ act , z@@ er@@ o fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int ."
"We &apos;ve set 20@@ 20 as our t@@ ar@@ get year for z@@ er@@ o , for re@@ ach@@ ing the top , the sum@@ m@@ it of M@@ oun@@ t S@@ u@@ st@@ ain@@ ability ."
We call this M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o .
And this is perhaps the most important fac@@ et : we have found M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o to be incredi@@ bly good for business .
"A better business model , a better way to bi@@ g@@ ger prof@@ its ."
Here is the business case for su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability .
"F@@ rom real life experience , cos@@ ts are down , not up , re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ting some 4@@ 00 million dollars of av@@ o@@ i@@ ded cos@@ ts in pur@@ su@@ it of z@@ er@@ o wa@@ st@@ e — the first face of M@@ oun@@ t S@@ u@@ st@@ ain@@ ability ."
This has pa@@ id all the cos@@ ts for the trans@@ for@@ mation of Inter@@ face .
"And this di@@ sp@@ els a my@@ th too , this f@@ al@@ se cho@@ ice between the environment and the econom@@ y ."
"O@@ ur produc@@ ts are the best they &apos;ve ever been , in@@ spi@@ red by design for su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability , an un@@ exp@@ ected w@@ ell@@ sp@@ r@@ ing of innov@@ ation ."
O@@ ur people are g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ized around this shar@@ ed high@@ er pur@@ p@@ ose .
You can@@ not be@@ at it for at@@ trac@@ ting the best people and br@@ ing@@ ing them together .
And the go@@ o@@ d@@ will of the mar@@ ke@@ t@@ place is ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing .
"@@ No amoun@@ t of ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing , no cle@@ ver mar@@ ke@@ ting cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , at any pr@@ ice , could have produc@@ ed or created this much go@@ o@@ d@@ will ."
"C@@ os@@ ts , produc@@ ts , people , mar@@ ke@@ t@@ places — what else is there ?"
It is a better business model .
And here is our 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year rec@@ ord of s@@ al@@ es and prof@@ its .
"There is a di@@ p there , from 200@@ 1 to 200@@ 3 : a di@@ p when our s@@ al@@ es , over a thre@@ e-@@ year per@@ i@@ od , were down 1@@ 7 percent ."
But the mar@@ ke@@ t@@ place was down 3@@ 6 percent .
We liter@@ ally g@@ ain@@ ed market share .
We might not have survi@@ ved that rec@@ es@@ sion but for the adv@@ ant@@ ages of su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability .
"If every business were pur@@ su@@ ing Inter@@ face pl@@ ans , would that sol@@ ve all our problems ?"
I don &apos;t think so .
"I re@@ ma@@ in tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed by the re@@ vi@@ sed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch equ@@ ation , I equ@@ als P times A divi@@ ded by T@@ 2 ."
"That A is a cap@@ ital A , su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ing that aff@@ l@@ u@@ ence is an end in itself ."
But what if we re@@ fra@@ m@@ ed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch f@@ ur@@ ther ?
"And what if we made A a lo@@ wer@@ case &apos; a , &apos; su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ing that it is a means to an end , and that end is happ@@ iness — more happ@@ iness with less stuff ."
"You know that would re@@ fra@@ me civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of econom@@ ics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ds us : the su@@ st@@ ain@@ able species , living on a fin@@ ite ear@@ th , e@@ th@@ ically , happ@@ ily and ec@@ o@@ log@@ ically in b@@ al@@ ance with nature and all her natural systems for a thous@@ and gener@@ ations , or 1@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations — that is to say , into the in@@ de@@ fin@@ ite future ."
But does the ear@@ th have to wa@@ it for our ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
"A@@ t Inter@@ face we really int@@ end to bring this prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical su@@ st@@ ain@@ able , z@@ er@@ o@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int indu@@ stri@@ al company fully into ex@@ ist@@ ence by 20@@ 20 ."
"We can see our way now , cle@@ ar to the top of that m@@ oun@@ tain ."
And now the chall@@ en@@ ge is in ex@@ ec@@ ution .
"And as my good friend and ad@@ vi@@ s@@ er A@@ m@@ ory L@@ o@@ v@@ ins says , &quot; If something ex@@ i@@ sts , it must be possible . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible ."
"If we , a pe@@ t@@ ro@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive company can do it , any@@ body can ."
"And if any@@ body can , it fol@@ lo@@ ws that everybody can ."
"H@@ aw@@ ken ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ed business and indu@@ stry , lead@@ ing hum@@ an@@ kind away from the ab@@ ys@@ s because , with contin@@ u@@ ed un@@ ch@@ ec@@ ked dec@@ line of the bi@@ osp@@ here , a very de@@ ar person is at ris@@ k here — fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly , an un@@ ac@@ cep@@ table ris@@ k ."
Wh@@ o is that person ?
N@@ ot you . N@@ ot I@@ .
But let me int@@ ro@@ duce you to the one who is most at ris@@ k here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this m@@ oun@@ tain clim@@ b .
"O@@ n a T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ ning in Mar@@ ch of 199@@ 6 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opport@@ un@@ ity back then , br@@ ing@@ ing them along and often not kno@@ wing whether I was connec@@ ting ."
"But about five days later back in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , I re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved an e@@ ma@@ il from G@@ l@@ en@@ n Th@@ om@@ as , one of my people in the C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a me@@ e@@ ting ."
He was sen@@ ding me an or@@ ig@@ in@@ al po@@ e@@ m that he had comp@@ os@@ ed after our T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ ning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most up@@ li@@ f@@ ting mom@@ ents of my life .
"Because it told me , by G@@ od , one person got it ."
"H@@ ere is what G@@ l@@ en@@ n wr@@ ote . And here is that person , most at ris@@ k ."
"P@@ le@@ ase me@@ et &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ out a name , an un@@ seen face , and kno@@ wing not your time or place , T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , though yet un@@ bor@@ n , I met you first last T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ n ."
A wi@@ se friend int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed us two .
"And through his so@@ ber@@ ing point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me ."
K@@ no@@ wing you has changed my thinking .
"For I never had an in@@ k@@ ling that perhaps the things I do might some@@ day , some@@ how thre@@ at@@ en you ."
"T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , my d@@ aughter , son , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;ve just be@@ gu@@ n to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should ."
"B@@ e@@ g@@ in , I will ."
"The way the cost of what I s@@ qu@@ an@@ der , what is l@@ ost , if ever I for@@ get that you will some@@ day come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ d &quot; &quot; has sp@@ o@@ ken to me with one simple but pro@@ found mess@@ age , which I pre@@ su@@ me to share with you ."
"We are , each and every one , a part of the we@@ b of life ."

"And we have a cho@@ ice to make during our bri@@ e@@ f , bri@@ e@@ f vi@@ s@@ it to this beautiful bl@@ ue and gre@@ en living planet : to h@@ ur@@ t it or to help it ."
"For you , it &apos;s your call ."
