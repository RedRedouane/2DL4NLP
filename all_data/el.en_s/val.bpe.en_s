"When I was 1@@ 1 , I remem@@ ber wa@@ king up one mor@@ ning to the sound of jo@@ y in my h@@ ou@@ se ."
"M@@ y father was li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to B@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws on his small , gr@@ ay radi@@ o ."
"There was a big s@@ mi@@ le on his face which was un@@ u@@ su@@ al then , because the news m@@ os@@ tly de@@ press@@ ed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are g@@ one ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan and made it il@@ le@@ g@@ al for girls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I dre@@ ss@@ ed as a bo@@ y to es@@ c@@ ort my ol@@ der sist@@ er , who was no longer allowed to be outside al@@ one , to a se@@ cre@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be edu@@ ca@@ ted .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different r@@ ou@@ te so that no one would su@@ spe@@ ct where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our b@@ oo@@ ks in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would seem we were just out sh@@ op@@ p@@ ing .
"The school was in a h@@ ou@@ se , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small li@@ ving room ."
It was co@@ z@@ y in w@@ in@@ ter but extre@@ me@@ ly h@@ o@@ t in su@@ mm@@ er .
"We all knew we were ri@@ s@@ king our lives — the teacher , the students and our par@@ ents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly be c@@ anc@@ el@@ ed for a wee@@ k because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were su@@ sp@@ ici@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being fol@@ lo@@ wed ?
Do they know where we live ?
"We were sc@@ ar@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ z@@ ed and d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters were tre@@ as@@ u@@ red .
M@@ y grand@@ father was an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary man for his time .
"A t@@ ot@@ al ma@@ ver@@ ic@@ k from a re@@ m@@ ote pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , he in@@ sist@@ ed that his daughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was di@@ so@@ w@@ ned by his father ."
But my edu@@ ca@@ ted mother be@@ came a teacher .
There she is .
"She re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our h@@ ou@@ se into a school for girls and women in our ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve an education .
"There was no question that his children would re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve an education , in@@ clu@@ ding his d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters , de@@ sp@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , de@@ sp@@ ite the ri@@ s@@ ks ."
"T@@ o him , there was gre@@ ater ri@@ s@@ k in not edu@@ ca@@ ting his children ."
"D@@ uring T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years , I remem@@ ber there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated by our life and always being sc@@ ar@@ ed and not see@@ ing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , my daughter , you can l@@ ose everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be for@@ c@@ ed to lea@@ ve your home d@@ uring a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to s@@ ell our b@@ loo@@ d to p@@ ay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to continu@@ e ? &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ ised in a country that has been de@@ stro@@ y@@ ed by de@@ ca@@ des of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ y@@ on@@ d high school , and had my family not been so comm@@ it@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I st@@ and here a pr@@ ou@@ d gra@@ du@@ ate of M@@ i@@ dd@@ le@@ b@@ ury C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ en I re@@ turned to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , my grand@@ father , the one ex@@ il@@ ed from his home for d@@ ar@@ ing to edu@@ ca@@ te his d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters , was am@@ ong the first to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate me ."
"He not only bra@@ gs about my college de@@ g@@ ree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l ."
( Applause ) M@@ y family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ a@@ ms even big@@ ger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 1@@ 0@@ x@@ 10 , a global ca@@ mp@@ a@@ i@@ gn to edu@@ ca@@ te women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , a country where it &apos;s still ri@@ sk@@ y for girls to go to school ."
The exc@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with am@@ bi@@ tion gr@@ ab@@ b@@ ing at op@@ p@@ ort@@ unity .
"And I see their par@@ ents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , ad@@ vo@@ ca@@ te for them , de@@ sp@@ ite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ position ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke A@@ h@@ m@@ ed . That &apos;s not his real na@@ me , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ m@@ ed is the father of one of my students ."
"@@ L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his daughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their village , and they liter@@ ally mi@@ ss@@ ed being k@@ il@@ led by a ro@@ ad@@ side bom@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ ri@@ ved home , the ph@@ one ran@@ g , a vo@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he s@@ ent his daughter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and bac@@ k@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to re@@ aliz@@ e about A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , and this is something that is o@@ f@@ ten dis@@ mi@@ ss@@ ed in the W@@ est , that be@@ h@@ ind most of us who su@@ c@@ ce@@ ed is a father who recogn@@ iz@@ es the valu@@ e in his daughter and who se@@ es that her success is his success ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mo@@ thers ar@@ en &apos;t k@@ ey in our success .
"In fact , they &apos;re o@@ f@@ ten the ini@@ ti@@ al and con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ing ne@@ go@@ ti@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters , but in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a society like in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , we must have the supp@@ ort of men ."
"@@ Un@@ der the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , girls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hund@@ re@@ ds — remem@@ ber , it was il@@ le@@ g@@ al ."
"But today , more than three million girls are in school in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan ."
( Applause ) A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americ@@ ans see the f@@ ra@@ gi@@ lity in changes .
I fe@@ ar that these changes will not last much be@@ y@@ on@@ d the U.S@@ . t@@ ro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , when I see the students in my school and their par@@ ents who ad@@ vo@@ ca@@ te for them , who en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge them , I see a pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing future and la@@ st@@ ing change ."
"T@@ o me , A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan is a country of hop@@ e and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less pos@@ sibi@@ li@@ ties , and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"@@ J@@ ust ab@@ solu@@ tely a@@ ma@@ zing , every single di@@ ve ."
D@@ is@@ appe@@ ar@@ s right into the bac@@ k@@ ground .
"So , he &apos;s b@@ lu@@ ff@@ ing . Let &apos;s do it bac@@ k@@ wards ."
"One , two , three ."
"When I was se@@ ven years old , I saw my first publi@@ c ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion ."
"If anything see@@ m@@ ed un@@ natural , I could be imp@@ ri@@ s@@ on@@ ed and rep@@ at@@ ri@@ ated ."
"E@@ ven though I was really for@@ t@@ un@@ ate to get out , many other N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans have not been so l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ."

"We are all K@@ o@@ re@@ an , but inside , we have become very different , du@@ e to 6@@ 7 years of divi@@ sion ."
A@@ m I S@@ ou@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ an or N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ an ?
So I started plan@@ ning how to help them es@@ cap@@ e .
I was so surpri@@ sed that a t@@ ot@@ al stran@@ ger car@@ ed enough to ask .
I re@@ alized that this was a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c moment in my life .
This is a kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten we de@@ sign@@ ed in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten to be a circ@@ le .
It &apos;s a kind of end@@ less circ@@ ulation on top of the ro@@ of .
This is how the ro@@ o@@ f@@ top looks .
And why did we desi@@ gn this ?
"The pr@@ inci@@ p@@ al of this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s imp@@ os@@ sible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ sist@@ ed : &quot; &quot; How about having a net s@@ tic@@ king out from the ed@@ ge of the ro@@ of ?"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es pop@@ p@@ ing through .
And we were allowed to call this rop@@ e as a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il .
"But of course , rop@@ e has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times 40 children are around a t@@ ree .
"The bo@@ y on the br@@ an@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the t@@ ree so he is e@@ ating the t@@ ree ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they s@@ it on the ed@@ ge ."
It looks so n@@ ice from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys in the z@@ o@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ ed@@ ing time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g wa@@ shing place — there are many kinds of water t@@ aps .
"You see with the f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble tu@@ b@@ es , you want to sp@@ r@@ ay water to your fri@@ ends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in fron@@ t is quite n@@ orm@@ al ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not wa@@ shing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s pu@@ tting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten is comple@@ tely op@@ en , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between inside and outside .
So it means ba@@ sically this ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between cla@@ ss@@ ro@@ oms .
So there is no ac@@ ous@@ tic b@@ ar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qui@@ et bo@@ x , some of them get really ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ v@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary .
"And the pr@@ inci@@ p@@ al says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to st@@ ay in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back even@@ tually , because it &apos;s a circ@@ le , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of o@@ c@@ ca@@ sion , u@@ su@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
"But here , just they lea@@ ve and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ dly , we con@@ si@@ der no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qui@@ et space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten , these children show a@@ ma@@ zing con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion in cla@@ ss ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the j@@ un@@ gle with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your fri@@ ends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not supp@@ osed to be in si@@ l@@ ence .
"And you know , these da@@ ys we are trying to make everything under contro@@ l ."
"You know , it &apos;s comple@@ tely op@@ en ."
And you should know that we can go sk@@ i@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in w@@ in@@ ter .
In su@@ mm@@ er you go s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
You never m@@ el@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are supp@@ osed to be outside ."
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they divi@@ de cla@@ ss@@ ro@@ oms .
They are supp@@ osed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A cla@@ ss@@ room .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the cla@@ ss@@ room .
A mon@@ k@@ ey trying to fi@@ sh another mon@@ k@@ ey from ab@@ ove .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each cla@@ ss@@ room has at lea@@ st one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ an@@ t@@ a C@@ la@@ us comes down at the time of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x buil@@ ding , right next to that o@@ v@@ al@@ -@@ shap@@ ed kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten ."
The buil@@ ding is only five me@@ ters t@@ all with se@@ ven f@@ lo@@ ors .
"And of course , the ce@@ il@@ ing he@@ ight is very low ."
So you have to con@@ si@@ der sa@@ fe@@ ty .
"So , we put our children , a daughter and a son ."
They tried to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s o@@ kay . H@@ is sk@@ ul@@ l is quite strong .
He is re@@ si@@ li@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to j@@ um@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ ff@@ ic j@@ am is a@@ w@@ ful in T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in fron@@ t , she ne@@ e@@ ds to learn how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now these da@@ ys , kids need a small d@@ os@@ age of d@@ an@@ ger ."
"And in this kind of o@@ c@@ ca@@ sion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of op@@ p@@ ort@@ unity we are l@@ os@@ ing these da@@ ys .
"Now , this d@@ ra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the move@@ ment of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
So it &apos;s not ex@@ actly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 me@@ ters in the mor@@ ning ."
But the surpri@@ se is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 me@@ ters on average ."
And these children have the high@@ est a@@ th@@ le@@ tic ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties am@@ ong many kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ s .
"The pr@@ inci@@ p@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We lea@@ ve them on top of the ro@@ of ."
"M@@ y point is don &apos;t contro@@ l them , don &apos;t pr@@ ot@@ ec@@ t them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble some@@ times ."
They need to get some in@@ j@@ ury .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
And this is one of the at@@ te@@ mp@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real chall@@ eng@@ es is to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ ally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ thr@@ all@@ ed to in education ."
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it ser@@ i@@ ously .
"C@@ an I ask you to ple@@ ase rec@@ all a time when you really lo@@ ved something — a mo@@ vi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a s@@ ong or a book — and you re@@ com@@ men@@ ded it wh@@ o@@ le@@ hear@@ te@@ dly to someone you also really li@@ ked , and you an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated that re@@ action , you wa@@ ited for it , and it came back , and the person h@@ ated it ?"
"So , by way of int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I sp@@ ent every wor@@ king day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school mat@@ h ."
"I s@@ ell a produc@@ t to a mark@@ et that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ c@@ ed by la@@ w to buy it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a l@@ os@@ ing pro@@ position ."
"So there &apos;s a u@@ se@@ ful ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about students that I see , a u@@ se@@ ful ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about you all ."
"I could give you gu@@ ys an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would expe@@ ct no high@@ er than a 2@@ 5 percent pas@@ s r@@ ate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call mat@@ h education in the U.S@@ . today .
"T@@ o start with , I &apos;d like to brea@@ k mat@@ h down into two ca@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies ."
One is compu@@ ta@@ tion ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ t@@ or@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ tics with lead@@ ing co@@ e@@ ff@@ ici@@ ents gre@@ ater than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , pro@@ vi@@ ded you have a really strong gr@@ oun@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the app@@ li@@ cation of mat@@ h proc@@ ess@@ es to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to cl@@ ose with , why this is an a@@ ma@@ zing time to be a mat@@ h teacher ."
"So first , five sy@@ mp@@ t@@ oms that you &apos;re doing mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your cla@@ ss@@ room ."
One is a l@@ ack of ini@@ ti@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your lec@@ ture b@@ loc@@ k and im@@ medi@@ ately you have five h@@ ands going up asking you to re@@ -@@ explain the enti@@ re thing at their de@@ s@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents l@@ ack per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
"They l@@ ack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find yourself re@@ -@@ expla@@ ining con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ o@@ le@@ s@@ ale ."
"There &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ sion to word problems , which describ@@ es 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the for@@ mul@@ a to app@@ ly in that s@@ it@@ u@@ ation .
This is really de@@ struc@@ tive .
"D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ at@@ or of &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ad@@ w@@ ood &quot; &quot; and other a@@ ma@@ zing T@@ V sho@@ ws , has a really good descri@@ p@@ tion for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating con@@ te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary d@@ ra@@ m@@ a , sho@@ ws set in the pres@@ ent day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four h@@ ours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ re@@ spe@@ ct , it shap@@ es the neur@@ al pa@@ th@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they expe@@ ct simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an imp@@ ati@@ ence with ir@@ re@@ s@@ olution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re imp@@ ati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t re@@ sol@@ ve quic@@ kly ."
"You expe@@ ct s@@ it@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three com@@ mer@@ cial brea@@ ks and a la@@ u@@ gh tr@@ ack ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will ru@@ n .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our t@@ ex@@ t@@ b@@ oo@@ ks — partic@@ ul@@ arly ma@@ ss@@ -@@ ad@@ op@@ ted t@@ ex@@ t@@ b@@ oo@@ ks — te@@ ach mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ally equ@@ i@@ v@@ al@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and call@@ ing it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics t@@ ex@@ t@@ book .
It app@@ lies equ@@ ally to mat@@ h .
"@@ No@@ tice , first of all here , that you have ex@@ actly three pi@@ ec@@ es of information there , each of which will fig@@ ure into a for@@ mul@@ a some@@ where , even@@ tually , which the stud@@ ent will then compu@@ te ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the gi@@ ven information in adv@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ pl@@ us of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have suff@@ ici@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m s@@ ure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s ha@@ m@@ str@@ ing@@ ing students because , wat@@ ch this , this is the pr@@ ac@@ tice problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tu@@ al problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ w@@ app@@ ing out numbers and tw@@ ea@@ king the cont@@ ex@@ t a little bit ."
"And if the stud@@ ent still doesn &apos;t recogn@@ ize the st@@ am@@ p this was m@@ ol@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ fully expla@@ ins to you what sa@@ mple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the for@@ mul@@ a ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , pas@@ s this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any physics , just kno@@ wing how to de@@ co@@ de a t@@ ex@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a s@@ ha@@ me ."
So I can di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the problem a little more speci@@ f@@ ically in mat@@ h .
Here &apos;s a really c@@ ool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ p@@ e using a sk@@ i li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate lay@@ ers , and I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate lay@@ ers and , partic@@ ul@@ arly , how when they &apos;re com@@ press@@ ed together and pre@@ sen@@ ted to the stud@@ ent all at once , how that cre@@ ates this imp@@ ati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll de@@ f@@ ine them here : You have the vi@@ su@@ al .
"You also have the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical struc@@ ture , talking about g@@ ri@@ ds , meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , la@@ be@@ ls , poin@@ ts , a@@ x@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ ste@@ ps , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which se@@ c@@ tion is the ste@@ e@@ pe@@ st ."
So I hop@@ e you can see .
"I really hop@@ e you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is ta@@ king a comp@@ elling question , a comp@@ elling answer , but we &apos;re pa@@ ving a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , stra@@ ight p@@ ath from one to the other and con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ating our students for how well they can ste@@ p over the small c@@ r@@ ac@@ ks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the vi@@ su@@ al , and I im@@ medi@@ ately ask the question : Wh@@ ich se@@ c@@ tion is the ste@@ e@@ pe@@ st ?"
And this star@@ ts con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion because the vi@@ su@@ al is cre@@ ated in such a way where you can de@@ f@@ end two ans@@ w@@ ers .
"So you get people ar@@ gu@@ ing against each other , fri@@ end ver@@ su@@ s fri@@ end , in pa@@ ir@@ s , j@@ ourn@@ al@@ ing , wh@@ at@@ ever ."
And then even@@ tually we re@@ aliz@@ e it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the sk@@ i@@ er in the lo@@ wer le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ hand side of the s@@ cre@@ en or the sk@@ i@@ er just ab@@ ove the mi@@ d l@@ ine .
"And we re@@ aliz@@ e how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D la@@ be@@ ls to talk about them more ea@@ si@@ ly ."
"And then as we start to de@@ f@@ ine what does ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness mean , we re@@ aliz@@ e it would be n@@ ice to have some meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments to really n@@ ar@@ row it down , speci@@ f@@ ically what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ row down that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical struc@@ ture ."
"The mat@@ h ser@@ ves the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the mat@@ h ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 cla@@ ss@@ es are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ p@@ e , ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then devel@@ o@@ p those sub@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"@@ Do you gu@@ ys see how this , right here , com@@ par@@ ed to that — which one cre@@ ates that pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , that mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been ob@@ vi@@ ous in my pr@@ ac@@ tice , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ i@@ el@@ d the f@@ lo@@ or here for a second to E@@ instein , who , I believe , has pa@@ id his du@@ es ."
"He tal@@ ked about the form@@ ulation of a problem being so incredi@@ b@@ ly important , and yet in my pr@@ ac@@ tice , in the U.S@@ . here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve them in the form@@ ulation of the problem ."
So 9@@ 0 percent of what I do with my five h@@ ours of pre@@ p time per wee@@ k is to take fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ elling el@@ e@@ ments of problems like this from my t@@ ex@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that supp@@ orts mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water t@@ ank .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ irst things first , we e@@ li@@ min@@ ate all the sub@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents have to devel@@ o@@ p those , they have to for@@ mul@@ ate those ."
And then no@@ tice that all the information wr@@ it@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"@@ N@@ one of it &apos;s a di@@ str@@ ac@@ tor , so we l@@ ose that ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents need to deci@@ de , &quot; &quot; A@@ ll right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the col@@ or of the v@@ al@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; S@@ uch an under@@ re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted question in mat@@ h cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .
So now we have a water t@@ ank .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of l@@ ine ar@@ t or c@@ li@@ p ar@@ t that you so o@@ f@@ ten see in t@@ ex@@ t@@ b@@ oo@@ ks , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real de@@ al .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a vi@@ de@@ o , a vi@@ de@@ o of someone fil@@ ling it up ."
"And it &apos;s fil@@ ling up s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents are looking at their wat@@ ch@@ es , ro@@ l@@ ling their ey@@ es , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ ited the h@@ ook , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fu@@ n for me because , like the in@@ tr@@ o , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about mat@@ h because someone else has the for@@ mul@@ a ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the for@@ mul@@ a better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stud@@ ent is on a level p@@ la@@ ying field of in@@ tu@@ ition ."
"E@@ very@@ one &apos;s fil@@ led something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ w@@ ering the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally and con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion@@ ally in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated jo@@ ining the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"We put n@@ am@@ es on the bo@@ ard , att@@ ach them to gu@@ ess@@ es , and kids have b@@ ought in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve describ@@ ed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer k@@ ey in the back of the teacher &apos;s e@@ dition ."
"We , instead , just wat@@ ch the end of the mo@@ vi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ o@@ re@@ tical mo@@ d@@ el@@ s that always work out in the answer k@@ ey in the back of a teacher &apos;s e@@ dition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s sc@@ ary to talk about sour@@ ces of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ o@@ re@@ tical does not mat@@ ch up with the pr@@ ac@@ tical ."
"But those con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions have been so valu@@ able , am@@ ong the most valu@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to rep@@ ort some really fu@@ n g@@ am@@ es with students who come pre@@ -@@ inst@@ all@@ ed with these vir@@ us@@ es day one of the cla@@ ss .
"Th@@ ese are the kids who now , one se@@ me@@ ster in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , t@@ ot@@ ally new , t@@ ot@@ ally fore@@ i@@ gn , and they &apos;ll have a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fu@@ n ."
"We &apos;re no longer a@@ verse to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated by mat@@ h , because we &apos;re s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ defin@@ ing what mat@@ h is ."
This has been a lot of fu@@ n .
"I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge mat@@ h teachers I talk to to use multi@@ medi@@ a , because it br@@ ings the real world into your cla@@ ss@@ room in high re@@ s@@ olution and ful@@ l col@@ or ; to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge stud@@ ent in@@ tu@@ ition for that level p@@ la@@ ying field ; to ask the sh@@ or@@ test question you pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly can and let those more speci@@ fi@@ c questions come out in con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ; to let students build the problem , because E@@ instein said so ; and to fin@@ ally , in t@@ ot@@ al , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book is hel@@ p@@ ing you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ lig@@ ation , for pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving and mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an a@@ ma@@ zing time to be a mat@@ h teacher right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um in our fron@@ t po@@ c@@ k@@ et .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fa@@ ir@@ ly ch@@ ea@@ p , and the to@@ ols to dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ te it fre@@ ely under op@@ en li@@ cen@@ ses has also never been che@@ ap@@ er or more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a vi@@ de@@ o ser@@ ies on my b@@ lo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vie@@ ws in two wee@@ ks ."
"I get e@@ ma@@ il@@ s still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never vi@@ s@@ ited saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ a@@ h . We had a good con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow ."
"I put this problem on my b@@ lo@@ g rec@@ ently : In a gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore , which l@@ ine do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 1@@ 9 it@@ e@@ ms or the l@@ ine with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one it@@ e@@ ms ."
"And the l@@ ine@@ ar mo@@ d@@ el@@ ing inv@@ olved in that was some good stuff for my cla@@ ss@@ room , but it even@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; G@@ ood M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few wee@@ ks later , which is just bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ clu@@ de that people , not just students , are really h@@ un@@ gr@@ y for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the vo@@ ca@@ b@@ ul@@ ary for your own in@@ tu@@ ition .
"So I just really en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , wh@@ at@@ ever your sta@@ ke is in education — whether you &apos;re a stud@@ ent , par@@ ent , teacher , poli@@ c@@ y ma@@ ker , wh@@ at@@ ever — in@@ si@@ st on better mat@@ h cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um ."
We need more pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ r@@ o C@@ or@@ p@@ or@@ ation of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
It &apos;s a piece of p@@ la@@ s@@ tic with a R@@ a@@ di@@ o S@@ h@@ ack an@@ ten@@ n@@ a att@@ ach@@ ed to it .
So that &apos;s just a fu@@ n little example here of the s@@ orts of things we do .
S@@ ort of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing comp@@ ati@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a B@@ u@@ ic@@ k hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ ali@@ le@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e to S@@ atur@@ n ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
There was a lot of people there .
"@@ Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the bac@@ k@@ side , which they started to wi@@ p@@ e off ."
Thank you .
"T@@ w@@ o years ago , I st@@ ood on the TED st@@ age in A@@ ru@@ sh@@ a , T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia ."
I sp@@ o@@ ke very bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly about one of my pr@@ ou@@ de@@ st cre@@ ations .
It was a simple mach@@ ine that chang@@ ed my life .
"@@ Be@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in M@@ ala@@ w@@ i ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never se@@ en an In@@ ter@@ net .
"O@@ n the st@@ age that day , I was so ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"M@@ y Eng@@ lish l@@ ost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by so many a@@ z@@ un@@ g@@ u , wh@@ ite people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feel@@ ing good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have se@@ ven children in my family .
"A@@ ll sist@@ ers , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my d@@ ad when I was a little bo@@ y .
"@@ Be@@ fore I disco@@ ver@@ ed the won@@ d@@ ers of science , I was just a simple far@@ m@@ er in a country of poor far@@ m@@ ers ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ ize ."
One year our for@@ t@@ un@@ e turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we experienc@@ ed an a@@ w@@ ful fa@@ m@@ ine .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five months all M@@ ala@@ wi@@ ans beg@@ an to star@@ ve to de@@ ath .
"M@@ y family ate one me@@ al per day , at ni@@ ght ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ si@@ m@@ a for each one of us .
The f@@ ood pas@@ ses through our bo@@ di@@ es .
We dro@@ p down to nothing .
"In M@@ ala@@ w@@ i , the secon@@ d@@ ary school , you have to p@@ ay school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the h@@ un@@ ger , I was for@@ c@@ ed to dro@@ p out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I cou@@ ldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I f@@ el@@ t very happy to be at the secon@@ d@@ ary school , so I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve education ."
So I went to a li@@ br@@ ary .
"I read b@@ oo@@ ks , science b@@ oo@@ ks , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally physics ."
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t read Eng@@ lish that well .
I used di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge in my h@@ ands .
It said a w@@ in@@ d@@ m@@ ill could p@@ um@@ p water and gener@@ ate electri@@ c@@ ity .
"@@ P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , a de@@ f@@ en@@ se against h@@ un@@ ger , which we were experienc@@ ing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one w@@ in@@ d@@ m@@ ill for my@@ self .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a sc@@ ra@@ p y@@ ard where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , in@@ clu@@ ding my mother , said I was c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) I found a tr@@ ac@@ tor f@@ an , sho@@ ck ab@@ s@@ or@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ p@@ es ."
"@@ U@@ sing a b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le f@@ ra@@ me and an old b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le d@@ y@@ n@@ am@@ o , I built my mach@@ ine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four li@@ ghts , with s@@ wit@@ ch@@ es , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it brea@@ ker , mo@@ d@@ el@@ ed after an electri@@ c be@@ ll ."
A@@ no@@ ther mach@@ ine pu@@ mp@@ s water for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .
Q@@ u@@ e@@ u@@ es of people start l@@ ining up at my h@@ ou@@ se ( Laughter ) to char@@ ge their mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ one .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the rep@@ or@@ ters came too , which le@@ ad to b@@ lo@@ g@@ g@@ ers and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TED ."
I had never se@@ en an a@@ ir@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ le@@ p@@ t in a h@@ ot@@ el .
"So , on st@@ age that day in A@@ ru@@ sh@@ a , my Eng@@ lish l@@ ost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the A@@ fri@@ c@@ ans , and the poor who are str@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling with your dre@@ a@@ ms ."
G@@ od b@@ less .
Ma@@ ybe one day you will wat@@ ch this on the In@@ ter@@ net .
"I say to you , trust yourself and believe ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever happens , don &apos;t give up ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
We re@@ tain just 2@@ 5 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying m@@ und@@ an@@ e s@@ oun@@ ds .
"This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble dr@@ y@@ er ."
"Now sound is my pas@@ sion , it &apos;s my life ."
I &apos;m going to spea@@ k today about the relation@@ ship between science and human valu@@ es .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally underst@@ ood that questions of mor@@ ality — questions of good and evi@@ l and right and wrong — are questions about which science off@@ ici@@ ally has no op@@ ini@@ on ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we valu@@ e , but it can never tell us what we ought to valu@@ e ."
"And , con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th li@@ ving for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ sti@@ tu@@ tes a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to ar@@ gu@@ e that this is an il@@ lu@@ sion — that the se@@ par@@ ation between science and human valu@@ es is an il@@ lu@@ sion — and actually quite a d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s o@@ f@@ ten said that science cannot give us a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for mor@@ ality and human valu@@ es , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and valu@@ es seem to be@@ long to different sp@@ her@@ es ."
It &apos;s o@@ f@@ ten thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ p@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ alu@@ es are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the well-being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ th@@ i@@ cal ob@@ lig@@ ations to@@ ward ro@@ c@@ ks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for ro@@ c@@ ks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ c@@ ks can suff@@ er . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our f@@ ell@@ ow pri@@ mat@@ es than we are about in@@ se@@ c@@ ts , as in@@ de@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ pos@@ ed to a gre@@ ater ran@@ ge of p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al happiness and suff@@ ering ."
"Now , the c@@ ru@@ cial thing to no@@ tice here is that this is a fac@@ tu@@ al cla@@ i@@ m : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed the relation@@ ship between bio@@ logical comple@@ x@@ ity and the pos@@ sibi@@ li@@ ties of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ se@@ c@@ ts ."
"And there &apos;s no no@@ tion , no ver@@ sion of human mor@@ ality and human valu@@ es that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about con@@ sci@@ ous experience and its possible changes ."
"E@@ ven if you get your valu@@ es from religi@@ on , even if you think that good and evi@@ l ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely re@@ l@@ ate to con@@ di@@ tions after de@@ ath — ei@@ ther to an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of happiness with G@@ od or an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of suff@@ ering in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can per@@ si@@ st after de@@ ath is itself a fac@@ tu@@ al cla@@ i@@ m , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to spea@@ k about the con@@ di@@ tions of well-being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a continu@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fa@@ il@@ ed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mo@@ thers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where str@@ ang@@ ers cannot find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ace@@ ful col@@ l@@ ab@@ or@@ ation , where people are m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in@@ di@@ scri@@ min@@ ately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continu@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more i@@ d@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a con@@ fer@@ ence like this is even con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a to the water be a good idea ?
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not .
"@@ W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evi@@ l ey@@ e , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ ately b@@ la@@ me their ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors ? P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human comm@@ uni@@ ties fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And mor@@ ality re@@ l@@ ates to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about valu@@ es we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our s@@ it@@ u@@ ation in the world can be underst@@ ood at many le@@ vel@@ s — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic syste@@ ms and poli@@ tical ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of nec@@ ess@@ ity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of our@@ selves within it is re@@ alized in the brain — wh@@ at@@ ever happens after de@@ ath .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ ber does get 7@@ 2 vir@@ g@@ ins in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his per@@ s@@ on@@ ality — his rather un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ate per@@ s@@ on@@ ality — is the produc@@ t of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as in@@ de@@ ed it does , it changes us by chang@@ ing our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ e@@ fore wh@@ at@@ ever cul@@ tur@@ al v@@ ari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh can , at lea@@ st in pr@@ inci@@ ple , be underst@@ ood in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a mat@@ uring science of the mind — neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , psycho@@ logy , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m ar@@ gu@@ ing is that valu@@ e &apos;s re@@ duc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the con@@ sci@@ ous experience of con@@ sci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can ther@@ e@@ fore vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e a space of possible changes in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a moral l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , with pe@@ a@@ ks and v@@ al@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ respon@@ d to differ@@ ences in the well-being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atures , both per@@ s@@ onal and col@@ lec@@ tive ."
"And one thing to no@@ tice is that perhaps there are st@@ ates of human well-being that we r@@ ar@@ ely acc@@ ess , that few people acc@@ ess ."
And these a@@ wa@@ it our disco@@ very .
P@@ er@@ h@@ aps some of these st@@ ates can be appro@@ pri@@ ately called my@@ sti@@ cal or sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al .
P@@ er@@ h@@ aps there are other st@@ ates that we can &apos;t acc@@ ess because of how our min@@ ds are struc@@ tu@@ red but other min@@ ds pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly could acc@@ ess them .
"Now , let me be c@@ lear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to ma@@ p this space , or that we will have scienti@@ fi@@ c ans@@ w@@ ers to every con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ able moral question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for inst@@ ance , that you will one day con@@ sul@@ t a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bom@@ b I@@ r@@ an &apos;s n@@ uc@@ lear fac@@ i@@ li@@ ties , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the ful@@ l cost of TED as a b@@ usiness exp@@ en@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions a@@ ffec@@ t human well-being then they do have ans@@ w@@ ers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting this — just ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to the question of how hum@@ ans fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh — will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our expe@@ c@@ ta@@ tions of human co@@ op@@ er@@ ation in the future ."
"For inst@@ ance , there are 2@@ 1 st@@ ates in our country where cor@@ p@@ or@@ al p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment in the cla@@ ss@@ room is le@@ g@@ al , where it is le@@ g@@ al for a teacher to be@@ at a child with a w@@ oo@@ d@@ en bo@@ ard , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing lar@@ ge br@@ u@@ is@@ es and b@@ li@@ st@@ ers and even brea@@ king the sk@@ in ."
"And hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of children , inci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , are sub@@ jec@@ ted to this every year ."
"The lo@@ ca@@ tions of these en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed dist@@ ri@@ c@@ ts , I think , will fa@@ il to surpri@@ se you ."
We &apos;re not talking about Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut .
And the ra@@ tion@@ ale for this behavi@@ or is exp@@ li@@ c@@ it@@ ly religi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ at@@ or of the universe hi@@ m@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , le@@ st we sp@@ oil the child — this is in P@@ ro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the ob@@ vi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally spea@@ king , to sub@@ ject children to pa@@ in and violence and publi@@ c hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation as a way of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing heal@@ thy e@@ mo@@ tional develop@@ ment and good behavi@@ or ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the no@@ tion of well-being is tru@@ ly un@@ defin@@ ed , and see@@ min@@ g@@ ly per@@ pe@@ tually op@@ en to be re@@ -@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed ."
"And so , how ther@@ e@@ fore can there be an ob@@ jec@@ tive no@@ tion of well-being ?"
"Well , con@@ si@@ der by an@@ al@@ o@@ gy , the con@@ cept of phy@@ sical health ."
The con@@ cept of phy@@ sical health is un@@ defin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el S@@ pe@@ c@@ ter , it has chang@@ ed over the years ."
Wh@@ en this st@@ at@@ u@@ e was car@@ ved the average life expe@@ c@@ t@@ anc@@ y was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ ddle with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to ru@@ n a mar@@ a@@ th@@ on at age 200 will be con@@ si@@ der@@ ed a pro@@ found dis@@ ab@@ i@@ lity .
Pe@@ ople will s@@ end you d@@ on@@ ations when you &apos;re in that con@@ dition .
"( Laughter ) No@@ tice that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is op@@ en , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely op@@ en for re@@ vi@@ sion , does not make it v@@ ac@@ u@@ ous ."
The dist@@ in@@ c@@ tion between a heal@@ thy person and a de@@ ad one is about as c@@ lear and con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to no@@ tice is there may be many pe@@ a@@ ks on the moral l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e : There may be equ@@ i@@ v@@ al@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be equ@@ i@@ v@@ al@@ ent ways to organiz@@ e a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ m@@ ine an ob@@ jec@@ tive mor@@ ality ?"
Well think of how we talk about f@@ ood : I would never be te@@ mp@@ ted to ar@@ gu@@ e to you that there must be one right f@@ ood to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a ran@@ ge of materi@@ als that con@@ sti@@ tu@@ te heal@@ thy f@@ ood .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less a c@@ lear dist@@ in@@ c@@ tion between f@@ ood and po@@ is@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ w@@ ers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is f@@ ood ? &quot; &quot; does not te@@ mp@@ t us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a univers@@ al mor@@ ality would re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e moral pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ m@@ it of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for inst@@ ance , if it &apos;s really wrong to li@@ e , it must always be wrong to li@@ e , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral tru@@ th ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , by an@@ al@@ o@@ gy , the ga@@ me of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to pl@@ ay good ch@@ ess , a pr@@ inci@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t l@@ ose your Q@@ u@@ een , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mom@@ ents when l@@ os@@ ing your Q@@ u@@ een is a bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant thing to do .
There are mom@@ ents when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a dom@@ a@@ in of per@@ fe@@ ct ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this br@@ ings us to the s@@ orts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the moral sp@@ here ."
Con@@ si@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ di@@ es : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can co@@ ver them up .
"Now , it is the position , gener@@ ally spea@@ king , of our intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ al comm@@ unity that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ os@@ ton or P@@ al@@ o A@@ l@@ to , who are we to say that the pr@@ ou@@ d d@@ en@@ iz@@ ens of an an@@ ci@@ ent culture are wrong to force their wi@@ ves and d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with l@@ eng@@ ths of ste@@ el ca@@ ble , or th@@ row b@@ at@@ ter@@ y ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they de@@ cl@@ ine the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pre@@ t@@ end that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be n@@ on@@ -@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ mental about a pr@@ ac@@ tice like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary w@@ ear@@ ing of a ve@@ il — women should be able to we@@ ar wh@@ at@@ ever they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary mean in a comm@@ unity where , when a girl gets r@@ ap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first imp@@ ul@@ se , rather o@@ f@@ ten , is to m@@ ur@@ der her out of s@@ ha@@ me ?"
"@@ J@@ ust let that fact de@@ t@@ on@@ ate in your brain for a minu@@ te : Y@@ our daughter gets r@@ ap@@ ed , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ pres@@ ents a pe@@ a@@ k of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the per@@ fe@@ ct s@@ olution in our own society ."
"For inst@@ ance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ st@@ and almost any@@ where in the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ed world ."
"Now , gr@@ an@@ ted , for many men it may re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e a de@@ g@@ ree in ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y to see something wrong with these imag@@ es ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ f@@ lec@@ tive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the per@@ fe@@ ct ex@@ pres@@ sion of psycho@@ logical bal@@ ance with re@@ spe@@ ct to v@@ ari@@ ab@@ les like y@@ ou@@ th and beau@@ ty and women &apos;s bo@@ di@@ es ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ tim@@ al environ@@ ment in which to ra@@ ise our children ?"
"@@ P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not . O@@ K , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spec@@ tru@@ m between these two extre@@ m@@ es that re@@ pres@@ ents a place of better bal@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ h@@ aps there are many such pl@@ ac@@ es — again , gi@@ ven other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ a@@ ks on the moral l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e ."
But the thing to no@@ tice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ a@@ k .
"Now the ir@@ on@@ y , from my per@@ spec@@ tive , is that the only people who seem to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions are religi@@ ous de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions because they got these ans@@ w@@ ers from a vo@@ ice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ w@@ ind , not because they made an intellig@@ ent an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is of the ca@@ us@@ es and con@@ dition of human and an@@ im@@ al well-being ."
"In fact , the end@@ ur@@ ance of religi@@ on as a l@@ ens through which most people view moral questions has se@@ par@@ ated most moral talk from real questions of human and an@@ im@@ al suff@@ ering ."
This is why we sp@@ end our time talking about things like g@@ ay marri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or n@@ uc@@ lear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or po@@ ver@@ ty or any other hu@@ ge@@ ly con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al is@@ sue .
But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : We need a univers@@ al con@@ cep@@ tion of human valu@@ es .
"Now , what st@@ ands in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to no@@ tice is that we do something different when talking about mor@@ ality — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally se@@ c@@ ular , a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic , scienti@@ st t@@ yp@@ es ."
Wh@@ en talking about mor@@ ality we valu@@ e differ@@ ences of op@@ ini@@ on in a way that we don &apos;t in any other are@@ a of our lives .
"So , for inst@@ ance the D@@ ala@@ i L@@ am@@ a gets up every mor@@ ning me@@ d@@ it@@ ating on compassion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ p@@ ing other human be@@ ings is an in@@ te@@ gr@@ al comp@@ on@@ ent of human happiness ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y ; T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y was very f@@ on@@ d of ab@@ duc@@ ting and r@@ ap@@ ing and t@@ ort@@ uring and k@@ il@@ ling young women ."
"So , we appe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ ini@@ on about how to prof@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ ost W@@ est@@ er@@ n intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ als look at this s@@ it@@ u@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ ala@@ i L@@ am@@ a to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real ar@@ g@@ ument that p@@ ot@@ enti@@ ally f@@ all@@ s within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He li@@ kes cho@@ col@@ ate , he li@@ kes v@@ an@@ il@@ l@@ a ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ a@@ de the other . &quot; &quot; No@@ tice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a string the@@ ori@@ st .
"If you ask the s@@ mar@@ test phy@@ si@@ ci@@ sts around who is the s@@ mar@@ test phy@@ si@@ ci@@ st around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics con@@ fer@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing theory is bo@@ g@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t re@@ s@@ on@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small sc@@ ale .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a phy@@ si@@ ci@@ st ; I don &apos;t understand string theory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y of string theory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to be@@ long to any string theory clu@@ b that would have me as a mem@@ ber .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ ini@@ ons must be ex@@ clu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a dom@@ a@@ in of ex@@ per@@ ti@@ se .
That is what it is for kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge to coun@@ t .
"@@ How have we con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed our@@ selves that in the moral sp@@ here there is no such thing as moral ex@@ per@@ ti@@ se , or moral tal@@ ent , or moral gen@@ i@@ us even ? How have we con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ ini@@ on has to coun@@ t ? How have we con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed our@@ selves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ jec@@ ts wor@@ th con@@ si@@ der@@ ing ?
D@@ o@@ es the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an have a point of view on physics that is wor@@ th con@@ si@@ der@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their i@@ gn@@ or@@ ance any less ob@@ vi@@ ous on the sub@@ ject of human well-being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world ne@@ e@@ ds now ."
"It ne@@ e@@ ds people like our@@ selves to ad@@ m@@ it that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing , and mor@@ ality re@@ l@@ ates to that dom@@ a@@ in of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for in@@ divi@@ du@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have belie@@ f@@ s and desi@@ res that reli@@ ably le@@ ad to ne@@ ed@@ less human suff@@ ering ."
J@@ ust ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting this will trans@@ form our dis@@ course about mor@@ ality .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ar@@ ies between n@@ ations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world fil@@ led with de@@ struc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ inv@@ en@@ ted ; it will always be ea@@ si@@ er to brea@@ k things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It seems to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , pat@@ ently ob@@ vi@@ ous that we can no more re@@ spe@@ ct and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate va@@ st differ@@ ences in no@@ tions of human well-being than we can re@@ spe@@ ct or t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate va@@ st differ@@ ences in the no@@ tions about how disease sp@@ rea@@ ds , or in the sa@@ fe@@ ty st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of buil@@ d@@ ings and a@@ ir@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must con@@ ver@@ ge on the ans@@ w@@ ers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ m@@ it that these questions have ans@@ w@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ b@@ us@@ ti@@ ble material there ."
"Wh@@ ether in this au@@ di@@ ence or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , hear@@ ing some of this , may well be doing the s@@ cre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ ra@@ ge thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age seems to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women dre@@ ss@@ ed in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , sp@@ o@@ ken with a lot of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a c@@ el@@ e@@ bra@@ tion of fe@@ m@@ ale speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a resul@@ t of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is ar@@ gu@@ ably a s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ ca@@ ted psycho@@ logical view — &quot; that m@@ ale l@@ ust is not to be tru@@ st@@ ed . &quot;"
"S@@ am H@@ ar@@ r@@ is : Y@@ ea@@ h , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a s@@ ent@@ ence , wat@@ ching the c@@ loc@@ k tic@@ king , but the question is : What is v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary in a cont@@ ex@@ t where men have certain expe@@ c@@ ta@@ tions , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to we@@ ar a ve@@ il , or a very fun@@ n@@ y h@@ at , or t@@ at@@ too their face — I think we should be f@@ ree to v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ari@@ ly do wh@@ at@@ ever we want , but we have to be hon@@ est about the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that these women are pl@@ ac@@ ed under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ag@@ er to always take their word for it , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re w@@ ear@@ ing a ful@@ l bur@@ q@@ a ."
C@@ A : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of moral progre@@ ss .
But can you re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that ?
"I think I underst@@ ood you to say that you could re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimen@@ si@@ onal , where we all have to think the same ."
"@@ P@@ a@@ in@@ t your picture of what ro@@ l@@ ling the c@@ loc@@ k 50 years for@@ ward , 100 years for@@ ward , how you would like to think of the world , bal@@ anc@@ ing moral progre@@ ss with ri@@ ch@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ m@@ it that we are on the p@@ ath to@@ ward underst@@ anding our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important deta@@ il , then you have to ad@@ m@@ it that we are going to understand all of the pos@@ itive and ne@@ g@@ ative qu@@ ali@@ ties of our@@ selves in much gre@@ ater deta@@ il ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand pos@@ itive social e@@ mo@@ tion like emp@@ a@@ thy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge it — whether they &apos;re g@@ ene@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic syste@@ ms , and in@@ so@@ far as we beg@@ in to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably going to con@@ ver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gr@@ ab@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my daughter from b@@ ir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ fi@@ dent and well-@@ edu@@ ca@@ ted in the cont@@ ex@@ t of men who do desi@@ re women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that comp@@ ul@@ s@@ ory ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone inv@@ olved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
Do people love their d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters just as much in these syste@@ ms ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ w@@ ers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ par@@ ed to shi@@ ft your inst@@ in@@ c@@ tive cur@@ r@@ ent j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these is@@ su@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well ye@@ a@@ h , mo@@ d@@ ul@@ o one ob@@ vi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a tru@@ ly d@@ el@@ u@@ si@@ onal belie@@ f system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my g@@ ay son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a bo@@ y@@ fri@@ end , I ch@@ op@@ p@@ ed his head off . And that was the most compas@@ sion@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; I@@ f you get all those parts ali@@ gn@@ ed , y@@ es I think you could probably be feel@@ ing the e@@ mo@@ tion of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a lar@@ ger cont@@ ex@@ t ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feel@@ ing ec@@ st@@ asy and then b@@ lo@@ wing hi@@ m@@ self up on a b@@ us ."
"C@@ A : S@@ am , this is a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion I would actually love to continu@@ e for h@@ ours ."
"We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED ."
S@@ H : Re@@ ally an hon@@ or . Thank you .
( Applause )
"So , imagine you &apos;re st@@ anding on a stre@@ et any@@ where in America and a Jap@@ an@@ ese man comes up to you and says , &quot; E@@ x@@ c@@ use me , what is the na@@ me of this b@@ loc@@ k ? &quot;"
"And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m s@@ or@@ ry , well , this is O@@ a@@ k S@@ tre@@ et , that &apos;s E@@ l@@ m S@@ tre@@ et ."
"This is 2@@ 6@@ th , that &apos;s 2@@ 7@@ th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but what is the na@@ me of that b@@ loc@@ k ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , b@@ loc@@ ks don &apos;t have n@@ am@@ es ."
"S@@ tre@@ ets have n@@ am@@ es ; b@@ loc@@ ks are just the un@@ n@@ am@@ ed sp@@ ac@@ es in between stre@@ ets . &quot; &quot; He lea@@ ves , a little con@@ f@@ used and dis@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ted ."
"So , now imagine you &apos;re st@@ anding on a stre@@ et , any@@ where in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; E@@ x@@ c@@ use me , what is the na@@ me of this stre@@ et ? &quot;"
"They say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , well that &apos;s B@@ loc@@ k 1@@ 7 and this is B@@ loc@@ k 1@@ 6 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but what is the na@@ me of this stre@@ et ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , stre@@ ets don &apos;t have n@@ am@@ es ."
B@@ loc@@ ks have n@@ am@@ es .
"@@ J@@ ust look at Google M@@ aps here . There &apos;s B@@ loc@@ k 14 , 15 , 1@@ 6 , 1@@ 7 , 1@@ 8 , 1@@ 9 ."
"A@@ ll of these b@@ loc@@ ks have n@@ am@@ es , and the stre@@ ets are just the un@@ n@@ am@@ ed sp@@ ac@@ es in between the b@@ loc@@ ks ."
"And you say then , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , then how do you know your home ad@@ dre@@ ss ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is D@@ ist@@ ri@@ ct E@@ ight ."
"There &apos;s B@@ loc@@ k 1@@ 7 , h@@ ou@@ se number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but wal@@ king around the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood , I no@@ tic@@ ed that the h@@ ou@@ se numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ f course they do . They go in the order in which they were built ."
The first h@@ ou@@ se ever built on a b@@ loc@@ k is h@@ ou@@ se number one .
The second h@@ ou@@ se ever built is h@@ ou@@ se number two .
"Th@@ ir@@ d is h@@ ou@@ se number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous . &quot; &quot; So , I love that some@@ times we need to go to the op@@ pos@@ ite side of the world to re@@ aliz@@ e as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and re@@ aliz@@ e that the op@@ pos@@ ite of them may also be true ."
"So , for example , there are doc@@ tors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you heal@@ thy ."
"So , any mon@@ th you are heal@@ thy you p@@ ay them , and when you &apos;re sic@@ k you don &apos;t have to p@@ ay them because they fa@@ il@@ ed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re heal@@ thy , not sic@@ k ."
"( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the do@@ w@@ n@@ be@@ at , the beginning of the mu@@ sical ph@@ ra@@ se : one , two , three , four ."
"But in W@@ est A@@ fri@@ can music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the ph@@ ra@@ se , like the peri@@ od at the end of a s@@ ent@@ ence ."
"So , you can hear it not just in the ph@@ r@@ as@@ ing , but the way they coun@@ t off their music : two , three , four , one ."
And this ma@@ p is also ac@@ cur@@ ate .
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that wh@@ at@@ ever true thing you can say about India , the op@@ pos@@ ite is also true ."
