"We live in difficult and chall@@ eng@@ ing economic times , of course ."
"And one of the first victi@@ ms of difficult economic times , I think , is publi@@ c sp@@ en@@ ding of any kind , but cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly in the fir@@ ing l@@ ine at the moment is publi@@ c sp@@ en@@ ding for science , and partic@@ ul@@ arly cu@@ ri@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ led science and expl@@ or@@ ation ."
So I want to try and con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you in about 15 minutes that that &apos;s a ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous and lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous thing to do .
"But I think to set the sc@@ en@@ e , I want to show — the next sli@@ de is not my at@@ te@@ mp@@ t to show the wor@@ st TED sli@@ de in the history of TED , but it is a bit of a m@@ ess ."
"( Laughter ) But actually , it &apos;s not my fa@@ ult ; it &apos;s from the G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ."
And it &apos;s actually a beautiful de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of how much science cos@@ ts .
"Because , if I &apos;m going to make the case for continu@@ ing to sp@@ end on cu@@ ri@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ dri@@ ven science and expl@@ or@@ ation , I should tell you how much it cos@@ ts ."
So this is a ga@@ me called &quot; &quot; sp@@ o@@ t the science bu@@ d@@ gets . &quot; &quot; This is the U.@@ K@@ . govern@@ ment sp@@ end .
"You see there , it &apos;s about 6@@ 20 billion a year ."
"The science bu@@ d@@ get is actually — if you look to your left , there &apos;s a pur@@ ple set of b@@ lob@@ s and then y@@ ell@@ ow set of b@@ lob@@ s ."
And it &apos;s one of the y@@ ell@@ ow set of b@@ lob@@ s around the big y@@ ell@@ ow b@@ lo@@ b .
It &apos;s about 3@@ .@@ 3 billion p@@ oun@@ ds per year out of 6@@ 20 billion .
That fun@@ ds everything in the U.@@ K@@ .
"@@ from medi@@ cal resear@@ ch , space expl@@ or@@ ation , where I work , at C@@ E@@ R@@ N in G@@ en@@ ev@@ a , partic@@ le physics , engine@@ ering , even ar@@ ts and hum@@ an@@ i@@ ties , f@@ und@@ ed from the science bu@@ d@@ get , which is that 3@@ .@@ 3 billion , that little , tiny y@@ ell@@ ow b@@ lo@@ b around the or@@ an@@ ge b@@ lo@@ b at the top left of the s@@ cre@@ en ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re ar@@ gu@@ ing about .
"That per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge , by the way , is about the same in the U.S@@ . and G@@ er@@ many and F@@ r@@ ance ."
"@@ R &@@ a@@ mp@@ ; D in t@@ ot@@ al in the econom@@ y , publi@@ c@@ ly f@@ und@@ ed , is about 0@@ .@@ 6 percent of G@@ D@@ P ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re ar@@ gu@@ ing about .
"The first thing I want to say , and this is stra@@ ight from &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ o@@ lar S@@ y@@ ste@@ m , &quot; &quot; is that our expl@@ or@@ ation of the solar system and the universe has sho@@ wn us that it is in@@ describ@@ ably beautiful ."
"This is a picture that actually was s@@ ent back by the C@@ as@@ sin@@ i space pro@@ be around S@@ atur@@ n , after we &apos;d fin@@ i@@ shed fil@@ m@@ ing &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ o@@ lar S@@ y@@ ste@@ m . &quot; &quot; So it isn &apos;t in the ser@@ ies ."
It &apos;s of the moon En@@ c@@ el@@ ad@@ us .
"So that big s@@ wee@@ p@@ ing , wh@@ ite sp@@ here in the cor@@ ner is S@@ atur@@ n , which is actually in the bac@@ k@@ ground of the picture ."
"And that cre@@ sc@@ ent there is the moon En@@ c@@ el@@ ad@@ us , which is about as big as the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh I@@ s@@ les ."
It &apos;s about 5@@ 00 k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters in di@@ a@@ me@@ ter .
"So , tiny moon ."
What &apos;s f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating and beautiful ...
"@@ this an un@@ proc@@ ess@@ ed picture , by the way , I should say , it &apos;s black and wh@@ ite , stra@@ ight from S@@ atur@@ ni@@ an or@@ bit ."
"What &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the lim@@ b there some fa@@ in@@ t , sort of , wi@@ sp@@ s of almost s@@ mo@@ ke ri@@ sing up from the lim@@ b ."
This is how we vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e that in &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ o@@ lar S@@ y@@ ste@@ m . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful grap@@ hi@@ c .
What we found out were that those fa@@ in@@ t wi@@ sp@@ s are actually f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of ice ri@@ sing up from the sur@@ face of this tiny moon .
"That &apos;s f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the me@@ chan@@ ism for po@@ w@@ ering those f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins re@@ qui@@ res there to be la@@ kes of li@@ qu@@ id water bene@@ ath the sur@@ face of this moon ."
"And what &apos;s important about that is that , on our planet , on Earth , wh@@ er@@ ever we find li@@ qu@@ id water , we find life ."
"So , to find strong evi@@ dence of li@@ qu@@ id , po@@ ols of li@@ qu@@ id , bene@@ ath the sur@@ face of a moon 7@@ 50 million mil@@ es away from the Earth is really quite a@@ st@@ oun@@ ding ."
"So what we &apos;re saying , essenti@@ ally , is maybe that &apos;s a ha@@ b@@ it@@ at for life in the solar system ."
"Well , let me just say , that was a grap@@ hi@@ c . I just want to show this picture ."
That &apos;s one more picture of En@@ c@@ el@@ ad@@ us .
This is when C@@ as@@ sin@@ i f@@ le@@ w bene@@ ath En@@ c@@ el@@ ad@@ us .
"So it made a very low pas@@ s , just a few hundred k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters ab@@ ove the sur@@ face ."
"And so this , again , a real picture of the ice f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ri@@ sing up into space , ab@@ solu@@ tely beautiful ."
But that &apos;s not the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ d@@ ate for life in the solar system .
"That &apos;s probably this place , which is a moon of J@@ up@@ it@@ er , Eu@@ rop@@ a ."
"And again , we had to f@@ ly to the Jo@@ vi@@ an system to get any sense that this moon , as most mo@@ ons , was anything other than a de@@ ad b@@ all of ro@@ ck ."
It &apos;s actually an ice moon .
"So what you &apos;re looking at is the sur@@ face of the moon Eu@@ rop@@ a , which is a th@@ ic@@ k sh@@ e@@ et of ice , probably a hundred k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters th@@ ic@@ k ."
"But by meas@@ uring the way that Eu@@ rop@@ a inter@@ ac@@ ts with the magnetic field of J@@ up@@ it@@ er , and looking at how those c@@ r@@ ac@@ ks in the ice that you can see there on that grap@@ hi@@ c move around , we &apos;ve in@@ fer@@ red very stron@@ g@@ ly that there &apos;s an o@@ ce@@ an of li@@ qu@@ id sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding the enti@@ re sur@@ face of Eu@@ rop@@ a ."
"So be@@ low the ice , there &apos;s an o@@ ce@@ an of li@@ qu@@ id around the whole moon ."
"It could be hund@@ re@@ ds of k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters de@@ ep , we think ."
"We think it &apos;s s@@ al@@ tw@@ ater , and that would mean that there &apos;s more water on that moon of J@@ up@@ it@@ er than there is in all the o@@ ce@@ ans of the Earth com@@ b@@ ined ."
"So that place , a little moon around J@@ up@@ it@@ er , is probably the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ d@@ ate for fin@@ ding life on a moon or a body outside the Earth , that we know of ."
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous and beautiful disco@@ very .
O@@ ur expl@@ or@@ ation of the solar system has ta@@ u@@ ght us that the solar system is beautiful .
"It may also have poin@@ ted the way to ans@@ w@@ ering one of the most pro@@ found questions that you can pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly ask , which is : &quot; &quot; A@@ re we al@@ one in the universe ? &quot; &quot; I@@ s there any other use to expl@@ or@@ ation and science , other than just a sense of won@@ der ?"
"Well , there is ."
"This is a very fa@@ m@@ ous picture taken , actually , on my first Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as E@@ ve , D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 4@@ th , 19@@ 6@@ 8 , when I was about eight months old ."
It was taken by A@@ p@@ ol@@ l@@ o 8 as it went around the back of the moon .
Ear@@ th@@ ri@@ se from A@@ p@@ ol@@ l@@ o 8 .
"A fa@@ m@@ ous picture ; many people have said that it &apos;s the picture that sa@@ ved 19@@ 6@@ 8 , which was a tur@@ b@@ ul@@ ent year — the stud@@ ent ri@@ ots in P@@ ar@@ is , the he@@ ight of the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am War ."
"The reason many people think that about this picture , and A@@ l G@@ ore has said it many times , actually , on the st@@ age at TED , is that this picture , ar@@ gu@@ ably , was the beginning of the environ@@ mental move@@ ment ."
"Because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a so@@ li@@ d , im@@ mo@@ v@@ able , kind of in@@ de@@ struc@@ ti@@ ble place , but as a very small , f@@ ra@@ gi@@ le@@ -@@ looking world just h@@ ang@@ ing against the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ ness of space ."
"What &apos;s also not o@@ f@@ ten said about the space expl@@ or@@ ation , about the A@@ p@@ ol@@ l@@ o progra@@ m , is the economic con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion it made ."
"I mean while you can make ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents that it was wonderful and a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous achi@@ ev@@ ement and de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed pic@@ tures like this , it cost a lot , didn &apos;t it ?"
"Well , actually , many studies have been done about the economic effec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ ess , the economic imp@@ act of A@@ p@@ ol@@ l@@ o ."
The big@@ gest one was in 19@@ 7@@ 5 by C@@ ha@@ se E@@ con@@ ome@@ tri@@ c@@ s .
"And it showed that for every $ 1 sp@@ ent on A@@ p@@ ol@@ l@@ o , 14 came back into the U.S@@ . econom@@ y ."
"So the A@@ p@@ ol@@ l@@ o progra@@ m pa@@ id for itself in in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion , in engine@@ ering , achi@@ ev@@ ement and , I think , in in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing young scienti@@ sts and engine@@ ers 14 times over ."
So expl@@ or@@ ation can p@@ ay for itself .
What about scienti@@ fi@@ c disco@@ very ?
What about dri@@ ving in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ?
"Well , this looks like a picture of vir@@ tually nothing ."
"What it is , is a picture of the spec@@ tru@@ m of hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en ."
"S@@ e@@ e , back in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s , 18@@ 9@@ 0s , many scienti@@ sts , many ob@@ ser@@ ver@@ s , looked at the light gi@@ ven off from at@@ oms ."
And they saw stran@@ ge pic@@ tures like this .
"What you &apos;re see@@ ing when you put it through a pri@@ s@@ m is that you he@@ at hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en up and it doesn &apos;t just g@@ low like a wh@@ ite light , it just em@@ its light at particular col@@ ors , a red one , a light b@@ lu@@ e one , some dark b@@ lu@@ e ones ."
Now that led to an underst@@ anding of at@@ om@@ ic struc@@ ture because the way that &apos;s expla@@ ined is at@@ oms are a single n@@ uc@@ le@@ us with electr@@ ons going around them .
And the electr@@ ons can only be in particular pl@@ ac@@ es .
"And when they j@@ um@@ p up to the next place they can be , and f@@ all back down again , they em@@ it light at particular col@@ ors ."
"And so the fact that at@@ oms , when you he@@ at them up , only em@@ it light at very speci@@ fi@@ c col@@ ors , was one of the k@@ ey dri@@ ver@@ s that led to the develop@@ ment of the quantum theory , the theory of the struc@@ ture of at@@ oms ."
I just wanted to show this picture because this is re@@ mark@@ able .
This is actually a picture of the spec@@ tru@@ m of the Sun .
"And now , this is a picture of at@@ oms in the Sun &apos;s at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here ab@@ s@@ or@@ b@@ ing light ."
"And again , they only ab@@ s@@ or@@ b light at particular col@@ ors when electr@@ ons j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down , j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down ."
But look at the number of black l@@ ines in that spec@@ tru@@ m .
And the el@@ ement he@@ li@@ um was disco@@ ver@@ ed just by star@@ ing at the light from the Sun because some of those black l@@ ines were found that cor@@ respon@@ ded to no known el@@ ement .
And that &apos;s why he@@ li@@ um &apos;s called he@@ li@@ um .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; he@@ li@@ os &quot; &quot; — he@@ li@@ os from the Sun .
"Now , that s@@ oun@@ ds es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic , and in@@ de@@ ed it was an es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic pur@@ su@@ it , but the quantum theory quic@@ kly led to an underst@@ anding of the behavi@@ ors of electr@@ ons in materi@@ als like si@@ li@@ c@@ on , for example ."
"The way that si@@ li@@ c@@ on beha@@ ves , the fact that you can build tr@@ an@@ sist@@ ors , is a pu@@ re@@ ly quantum ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on ."
"So without that cu@@ ri@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ dri@@ ven underst@@ anding of the struc@@ ture of at@@ oms , which led to this rather es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic theory , quantum me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s , then we wouldn &apos;t have tr@@ an@@ sist@@ ors , we wouldn &apos;t have si@@ li@@ c@@ on ch@@ i@@ ps , we wouldn &apos;t have pretty much the bas@@ is of our modern econom@@ y ."
"There &apos;s one more , I think , wonderful tw@@ ist to that tal@@ e ."
"In &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ o@@ lar S@@ y@@ ste@@ m , &quot; &quot; we ke@@ p@@ t emp@@ ha@@ si@@ zing the la@@ ws of physics are univers@@ al ."
"It &apos;s one of the most incredi@@ ble things about the physics and the underst@@ anding of nature that you get on Earth , is you can tr@@ an@@ sp@@ ort it , not only to the planets , but to the most dist@@ ant stars and galaxies ."
"And one of the a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ shing pre@@ dic@@ tions of quantum me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s , just by looking at the struc@@ ture of at@@ oms — the same theory that describ@@ es tr@@ an@@ sist@@ ors — is that there can be no stars in the universe that have re@@ ach@@ ed the end of their life that are big@@ ger than , quite speci@@ f@@ ically , 1@@ .@@ 4 times the ma@@ ss of the Sun ."
That &apos;s a lim@@ it imp@@ osed on the ma@@ ss of stars .
"You can work it out on a piece of p@@ ap@@ er in a l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory , get a t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e , s@@ wing it to the sk@@ y , and you find that there are no de@@ ad stars big@@ ger than 1@@ .@@ 4 times the ma@@ ss of the Sun ."
That &apos;s quite an incredi@@ ble pre@@ dic@@ tion .
What happens when you have a star that &apos;s right on the ed@@ ge of that ma@@ ss ?
"Well , this is a picture of it ."
"This is the picture of a galax@@ y , a common &quot; &quot; our g@@ ar@@ d@@ en &quot; &quot; galax@@ y with , what , 100 billion stars like our Sun in it ."
It &apos;s just one of b@@ illions of galaxies in the universe .
"There are a billion stars in the g@@ al@@ ac@@ tic c@@ ore , which is why it &apos;s sh@@ ining out so bri@@ gh@@ tly ."
"This is about 50 million light years away , so one of our ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ing galaxies ."
But that b@@ right star there is actually one of the stars in the galax@@ y .
So that star is also 50 million light years away .
"It &apos;s part of that galax@@ y , and it &apos;s sh@@ ining as bri@@ gh@@ tly as the cen@@ ter of the galax@@ y with a billion s@@ un@@ s in it ."
That &apos;s a T@@ yp@@ e I@@ a super@@ no@@ v@@ a expl@@ os@@ i@@ on .
"Now that &apos;s an incredi@@ ble ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a , because it &apos;s a star that s@@ its there ."
It &apos;s called a car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ oxy@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f .
"It s@@ its there about , say , 1@@ .@@ 3 times the ma@@ ss of the Sun ."
"And it has a b@@ in@@ ary comp@@ an@@ i@@ on that goes around it , so a big star , a big b@@ all of g@@ as ."
"And what it does is it su@@ c@@ ks g@@ as off its comp@@ an@@ i@@ on star , until it gets to this lim@@ it called the Ch@@ and@@ ra@@ se@@ k@@ ha@@ r lim@@ it , and then it exp@@ lo@@ des ."
"And it exp@@ lo@@ des , and it sh@@ ines as bri@@ gh@@ tly as a billion s@@ un@@ s for about two wee@@ ks , and rele@@ as@@ es , not only energy , but a hu@@ ge amount of che@@ mi@@ cal el@@ e@@ ments into the universe ."
"In fact , that one is a car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ oxy@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f ."
"Now , there was no car@@ b@@ on and oxy@@ g@@ en in the universe at the Big Bang ."
And there was no car@@ b@@ on and oxy@@ g@@ en in the universe thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the first gener@@ ation of stars .
"It was made in stars like that , loc@@ ked away and then re@@ turned to the universe in expl@@ os@@ i@@ ons like that in order to re@@ con@@ d@@ en@@ se into planets , stars , new solar syste@@ ms and , in@@ de@@ ed , people like us ."
"I think that &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ able de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of the power and beau@@ ty and univers@@ ality of the la@@ ws of physics , because we understand that process , because we understand the struc@@ ture of at@@ oms here on Earth ."
"This is a beautiful quot@@ e that I found — we &apos;re talking about ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity there — from A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ er F@@ le@@ m@@ ing : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en I w@@ o@@ ke up just after da@@ wn on S@@ e@@ p@@ te@@ m@@ ber 2@@ 8 , 19@@ 2@@ 8 , I cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly didn &apos;t pl@@ an to re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ize all medicine by disco@@ ver@@ ing the world &apos;s first an@@ ti@@ bio@@ tic . &quot; &quot; Now , the expl@@ or@@ ers of the world of the at@@ om did not int@@ end to inv@@ ent the tr@@ an@@ sist@@ or ."
"And they cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly didn &apos;t int@@ end to descri@@ be the me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s of super@@ no@@ v@@ a expl@@ os@@ i@@ ons , which even@@ tually told us where the buil@@ ding b@@ loc@@ ks of life were sy@@ n@@ the@@ si@@ z@@ ed in the universe ."
"So , I think science can be — ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity is important ."
It can be beautiful . It can re@@ ve@@ al quite a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ shing things .
"It can also , I think , fin@@ ally re@@ ve@@ al the most pro@@ found ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the valu@@ e of our home planet ."
This is a spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular picture of our home planet .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet ."
"It looks like S@@ atur@@ n because , of course , it is ."
It was taken by the C@@ as@@ sin@@ i space pro@@ be .
"But it &apos;s a fa@@ m@@ ous picture , not because of the beau@@ ty and ma@@ j@@ est@@ y of S@@ atur@@ n &apos;s r@@ ings , but actually because of a tiny , fa@@ in@@ t b@@ lo@@ b just h@@ ang@@ ing under@@ ne@@ ath one of the r@@ ings ."
"And if I b@@ low it up there , you see it ."
"It looks like a moon , but in fact , it &apos;s a picture of Earth ."
It was a picture of Earth cap@@ tu@@ red in that f@@ ra@@ me of S@@ atur@@ n .
That &apos;s our planet from 7@@ 50 million mil@@ es away .
"I think the Earth has got a stran@@ ge pro@@ per@@ ty that the far@@ ther away you get from it , the more beautiful it seems ."
But that is not the most dist@@ ant or most fa@@ m@@ ous picture of our planet .
"It was taken by this thing , which is called the V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft ."
And that &apos;s a picture of me in fron@@ t of it for sc@@ ale .
The V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er is a tiny mach@@ ine .
"It &apos;s cur@@ r@@ ently 10 billion mil@@ es away from Earth , trans@@ m@@ it@@ ting with that dis@@ h , with the power of 20 wat@@ ts , and we &apos;re still in cont@@ act with it ."
"But it vi@@ s@@ ited J@@ up@@ it@@ er , S@@ atur@@ n , U@@ ran@@ us and Ne@@ p@@ t@@ un@@ e ."
"And after it vi@@ s@@ ited all four of those planets , C@@ ar@@ l S@@ ag@@ an , who &apos;s one of my great her@@ o@@ es , had the wonderful idea of tur@@ ning V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er around and ta@@ king a picture of every planet it had vi@@ s@@ ited ."
And it took this picture of Earth .
"Now it &apos;s very hard to see the Earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; P@@ ale B@@ lu@@ e D@@ o@@ t &quot; &quot; picture , but Earth is su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded in that red s@@ ha@@ ft of light ."
That &apos;s Earth from four billion mil@@ es away .
"And I &apos;d like to read you what S@@ ag@@ an wr@@ ote about it , just to fin@@ ish , because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to descri@@ be what he saw in that picture that he had taken ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Con@@ si@@ der again that do@@ t ."
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
"O@@ n it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was li@@ ved out their lives ."
"The ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ates of jo@@ y and suff@@ ering thousands of con@@ fi@@ dent religi@@ ons , ide@@ o@@ logi@@ es and economic doc@@ tr@@ ines , every h@@ un@@ ter and for@@ ag@@ er , every her@@ o and co@@ ward , every cre@@ at@@ or and de@@ stro@@ y@@ er of ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , every king and pe@@ as@@ ant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , hop@@ e@@ ful child , inv@@ ent@@ or and exp@@ lo@@ re@@ r , every teacher of mor@@ als , every cor@@ ru@@ p@@ t poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an , every super@@ star , every su@@ pre@@ me lead@@ er , every sa@@ in@@ t and sin@@ ner in the history of our speci@@ es , li@@ ved there , on a m@@ ote of d@@ ust , su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded in a s@@ un@@ be@@ am ."
It &apos;s been said that a@@ stron@@ om@@ y &apos;s a hum@@ bl@@ ing and char@@ ac@@ ter@@ -@@ buil@@ ding experience .
There is perhaps no better de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of the fol@@ ly of human con@@ ce@@ its than this dist@@ ant i@@ ma@@ ge of our tiny world .
"T@@ o me , it under@@ s@@ co@@ res our respon@@ sibi@@ lity to de@@ al more kin@@ dly with one another and to pre@@ ser@@ ve and ch@@ er@@ ish the p@@ ale b@@ lu@@ e do@@ t , the only home we &apos;ve ever known . &quot; &quot; Be@@ au@@ tiful words about the power of science and expl@@ or@@ ation ."
"The ar@@ g@@ ument has always been made , and it will always be made , that we know enough about the universe ."
You could have made it in the 19@@ 20@@ s ; you wouldn &apos;t have had p@@ en@@ ic@@ il@@ l@@ in .
You could have made it in the 18@@ 9@@ 0s ; you wouldn &apos;t have the tr@@ an@@ sist@@ or .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
"S@@ u@@ re@@ ly , we know enough ."
We don &apos;t need to disco@@ ver anything else about our universe .
"@@ Let me lea@@ ve the last words to someone who &apos;s r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly be@@ coming a her@@ o of m@@ ine , H@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ re@@ y D@@ a@@ v@@ y , who did his science at the turn of the 19@@ th century ."
He was c@@ lear@@ ly under as@@ sa@@ ult all the time .
&quot; &quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19@@ th century .
"@@ J@@ ust exp@@ lo@@ it it ; just build things . &quot; &quot; He said this , he said , &quot; &quot; No@@ thing is more f@@ at@@ al to the progre@@ ss of the human mind than to pre@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ tim@@ ate , that our tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ s are comple@@ te , that there are no my@@ ster@@ ies in nature , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."

This is a t@@ ree .
T@@ ree .
This is a m@@ oun@@ tain .
The su@@ n .
The moon .
The sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the do@@ or looks like a pa@@ ir of s@@ al@@ o@@ on do@@ ors in the wi@@ ld we@@ st .
I call these eight char@@ ac@@ ters ra@@ dic@@ als .
They are the buil@@ ding b@@ loc@@ ks for you to create lots more char@@ ac@@ ters .
A person .
"If someone wal@@ ks be@@ h@@ ind , that is &quot; &quot; to fol@@ low . &quot; &quot; A@@ s the old saying goes , two is comp@@ any , three is a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
"If a person stre@@ t@@ ched their ar@@ ms wi@@ de , this person is saying , &quot; &quot; It was this big . &quot; &quot; The person inside the m@@ ou@@ th , the person is tr@@ app@@ ed ."
"He &apos;s a pri@@ s@@ on@@ er , just like J@@ on@@ a@@ h inside the wh@@ ale ."
"One t@@ ree is a t@@ ree . T@@ w@@ o tre@@ es together , we have the w@@ oo@@ ds ."
"Th@@ ree tre@@ es together , we create the fore@@ st ."
"@@ P@@ ut a plan@@ k under@@ ne@@ ath the t@@ ree , we have the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
"@@ P@@ ut a m@@ ou@@ th on the top of the t@@ ree , that &apos;s &quot; &quot; i@@ di@@ o@@ t . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ asy to remem@@ ber , since a talking t@@ ree is pretty i@@ di@@ o@@ tic ."
Re@@ mem@@ ber fire ?
"T@@ w@@ o fi@@ res together , I get really h@@ o@@ t ."
"Th@@ ree fi@@ res together , that &apos;s a lot of f@@ la@@ m@@ es ."
"S@@ et the fire under@@ ne@@ ath the two tre@@ es , it &apos;s bur@@ ning ."
"For us , the su@@ n is the sour@@ ce of pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity ."
"T@@ w@@ o s@@ un@@ s together , pr@@ os@@ per@@ ous ."
"Th@@ ree together , that &apos;s s@@ par@@ k@@ les ."
"@@ P@@ ut the su@@ n and the moon sh@@ ining together , it &apos;s bri@@ ght@@ ness ."
"It also means tom@@ or@@ row , after a day and a ni@@ ght ."
The su@@ n is coming up ab@@ ove the h@@ or@@ iz@@ on . S@@ un@@ ri@@ se .
"A do@@ or . P@@ ut a plan@@ k inside the do@@ or , it &apos;s a do@@ or b@@ ol@@ t ."
"@@ P@@ ut a m@@ ou@@ th inside the do@@ or , asking questions ."
K@@ no@@ ck kno@@ ck . I@@ s any@@ one home ?
"This person is s@@ ne@@ a@@ king out of a do@@ or , es@@ cap@@ ing , ev@@ ad@@ ing ."
"O@@ n the left , we have a woman ."
"T@@ w@@ o women together , they have an ar@@ g@@ ument ."
"( Laughter ) Th@@ ree women together , be car@@ e@@ ful , it &apos;s ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ y ."
So we have g@@ one through almost 30 char@@ ac@@ ters .
"B@@ y using this me@@ th@@ od , the first eight ra@@ dic@@ als will all@@ ow you to build 3@@ 2 ."
The next group of eight char@@ ac@@ ters will build an extra 3@@ 2 .
"So with very little e@@ ff@@ ort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred char@@ ac@@ ters , which is the same as a Chin@@ ese ei@@ ght@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old ."
"So after we know the char@@ ac@@ ters , we start buil@@ ding ph@@ r@@ as@@ es ."
"For example , the m@@ oun@@ tain and the fire together , we have fire m@@ oun@@ tain . It &apos;s a v@@ ol@@ can@@ o ."
We know Japan is the land of the ri@@ sing su@@ n .
"This is a su@@ n pl@@ ac@@ ed with the ori@@ g@@ in , because Japan lies to the ea@@ st of China ."
"So a su@@ n , ori@@ g@@ in together , we build Japan ."
"A person be@@ h@@ ind Japan , what do we get ?"
A Jap@@ an@@ ese person .
The char@@ ac@@ ter on the left is two m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins st@@ ac@@ ked on top of each other .
"In an@@ ci@@ ent China , that means in ex@@ ile , because Chin@@ ese em@@ per@@ ors , they put their poli@@ tical ene@@ mi@@ es in ex@@ ile be@@ y@@ on@@ d m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ."
"@@ No@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , ex@@ ile has turned into getting out ."
A m@@ ou@@ th which t@@ ells you where to get out is an ex@@ it .
This is a sli@@ de to re@@ mind me that I should stop talking and get off of the st@@ age . Thank you .

"I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do resear@@ ch on at the Uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
J@@ ust think about this problem for a second .
"@@ Here is a l@@ um@@ p of f@@ le@@ sh , about three p@@ oun@@ ds , which you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand ."
But it can con@@ te@@ mp@@ l@@ ate the va@@ st@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ lar space .
"It can con@@ te@@ mp@@ l@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity , ask questions about the me@@ an@@ ing of its own exist@@ ence , about the nature of G@@ od ."
And this is tru@@ ly the most a@@ ma@@ zing thing in the world .
It &apos;s the gre@@ at@@ est my@@ st@@ ery con@@ fron@@ ting human be@@ ings : How does this all come about ?
"Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons ."
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the ad@@ ult human brain .
"And each neur@@ on makes something like 1@@ ,000 to 1@@ 0,000 cont@@ ac@@ ts with other neurons in the brain ."
"And based on this , people have cal@@ cul@@ ated that the number of per@@ mu@@ ta@@ tions and com@@ b@@ in@@ ations of brain acti@@ vity ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds the number of el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary particles in the universe ."
"So , how do you go about stud@@ ying the brain ?"
"One appro@@ ach is to look at patients who had le@@ sions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavi@@ or ."
This is what I sp@@ o@@ ke about in the last TED .
"T@@ o@@ day I &apos;ll talk about a different appro@@ ach , which is to put elec@@ t@@ ro@@ des in different parts of the brain , and actually rec@@ or@@ d the acti@@ vity of in@@ divi@@ du@@ al ner@@ ve cells in the brain ."
S@@ ort of ea@@ v@@ es@@ dro@@ p on the acti@@ vity of ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
"Now , one re@@ cent disco@@ very that has been made by resear@@ ch@@ ers in I@@ tal@@ y , in P@@ ar@@ m@@ a , by G@@ i@@ ac@@ om@@ o R@@ iz@@ z@@ ol@@ att@@ i and his colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es , is a group of neurons called m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons , which are on the fron@@ t of the brain in the fron@@ t@@ al lob@@ es ."
"Now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordin@@ ary m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and neurons in the fron@@ t of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years ."
These neurons will fire when a person per@@ for@@ ms a speci@@ fi@@ c action .
"For example , if I do that , and re@@ ach and gra@@ b an app@@ le , a m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and neur@@ on in the fron@@ t of my brain will fire ."
"If I re@@ ach out and pul@@ l an ob@@ ject , another neur@@ on will fire , comm@@ anding me to pul@@ l that ob@@ ject ."
These are called m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and neurons that have been known for a long time .
"But what R@@ iz@@ z@@ ol@@ att@@ i found was a sub@@ set of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when I &apos;m looking at somebody else per@@ form@@ ing the same action ."
"So , here is a neur@@ on that fi@@ res when I re@@ ach and gra@@ b something , but it also fi@@ res when I wat@@ ch Jo@@ e re@@ ach@@ ing and gr@@ ab@@ b@@ ing something ."
And this is tru@@ ly a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ shing .
Because it &apos;s as though this neur@@ on is ad@@ op@@ ting the other person &apos;s point of view .
It &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s per@@ form@@ ing a vir@@ tu@@ al reality si@@ m@@ ulation of the other person &apos;s action .
"Now , what is the sign@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance of these m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons ?"
F@@ or one thing they must be inv@@ olved in things like im@@ it@@ ation and em@@ ulation .
Because to im@@ it@@ ate a comple@@ x act re@@ qui@@ res my brain to ad@@ op@@ t the other person &apos;s point of view .
"So , this is important for im@@ it@@ ation and em@@ ulation ."
"Well , why is that important ?"
"Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next sli@@ de ."
"So , how do you do im@@ it@@ ation ? Why is im@@ it@@ ation important ?"
"M@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons and im@@ it@@ ation , em@@ ulation ."
"Now , let &apos;s look at culture , the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on of human culture ."
"If you go back in time about &#91; 7@@ 5@@ ,000 &#93; to 1@@ 00@@ ,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 7@@ 5@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And that is , there is a su@@ dd@@ en e@@ mer@@ g@@ ence and r@@ ap@@ id sp@@ read of a number of sk@@ il@@ ls that are uni@@ qu@@ e to human be@@ ings like too@@ l use , the use of fire , the use of sh@@ el@@ ters , and , of course , language , and the ab@@ i@@ lity to read somebody else &apos;s mind and inter@@ pre@@ t that person &apos;s behavi@@ or ."
A@@ ll of that happened rela@@ tively quic@@ kly .
"E@@ ven though the human brain had achi@@ ev@@ ed its pres@@ ent si@@ ze almost three or four hundred thous@@ and years ago , 1@@ 00@@ ,000 years ago all of this happened very , very quic@@ kly ."
"And I cla@@ i@@ m that what happened was the su@@ dd@@ en e@@ mer@@ g@@ ence of a s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ ca@@ ted m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neur@@ on system , which allowed you to e@@ mul@@ ate and im@@ it@@ ate other people &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"So that when there was a su@@ dd@@ en ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ental disco@@ very by one mem@@ ber of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular t@@ yp@@ e of too@@ l , instead of d@@ ying out , this sp@@ read r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly , h@@ or@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ ally across the population , or was trans@@ m@@ it@@ ted ver@@ tic@@ ally , down the gener@@ ations ."
"So , this made evolution su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly L@@ am@@ ar@@ c@@ ki@@ an , instead of D@@ ar@@ w@@ ini@@ an ."
D@@ ar@@ w@@ ini@@ an evolution is s@@ low ; it ta@@ kes hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of years .
"A po@@ lar be@@ ar , to ev@@ ol@@ ve a co@@ at , will take thousands of gener@@ ations , maybe 1@@ 00@@ ,000 years ."
"A human being , a child , can just wat@@ ch its par@@ ent k@@ ill another po@@ lar be@@ ar , and sk@@ in it and put the sk@@ in on its body , fu@@ r on the body , and learn it in one ste@@ p . What the po@@ lar be@@ ar took 1@@ 00@@ ,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes ."
And then once it &apos;s learned this it sp@@ rea@@ ds in ge@@ ome@@ tri@@ c pro@@ p@@ or@@ tion across a population .
This is the bas@@ is . The im@@ it@@ ation of comple@@ x sk@@ il@@ ls is what we call culture and is the bas@@ is of ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation .
"Now there is another kind of m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neur@@ on , which is inv@@ olved in something quite different ."
"And that is , there are m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons , just as there are m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons for action , there are m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons for tou@@ ch ."
"In other words , if somebody tou@@ ch@@ es me , my hand , neur@@ on in the som@@ at@@ os@@ en@@ s@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x in the sen@@ s@@ ory re@@ gi@@ on of the brain fi@@ res ."
"But the same neur@@ on , in some ca@@ ses , will fire when I simply wat@@ ch another person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , it &apos;s emp@@ a@@ th@@ iz@@ ing the other person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , most of them will fire when I &apos;m tou@@ ched in different lo@@ ca@@ tions . D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent neurons for different lo@@ ca@@ tions ."
But a sub@@ set of them will fire even when I wat@@ ch somebody else being tou@@ ched in the same lo@@ cation .
"So , here again you have neurons which are en@@ ro@@ l@@ led in emp@@ a@@ thy ."
"Now , the question then ar@@ is@@ es : I@@ f I simply wat@@ ch another person being tou@@ ched , why do I not get con@@ f@@ used and liter@@ ally feel that tou@@ ch sen@@ sa@@ tion mer@@ ely by wat@@ ching somebody being tou@@ ched ?"
"I mean , I emp@@ a@@ th@@ ize with that person but I don &apos;t liter@@ ally feel the tou@@ ch ."
"Well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got re@@ cep@@ tors in your sk@@ in , tou@@ ch and pa@@ in re@@ cep@@ tors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry , you &apos;re not being tou@@ ched ."
"So , emp@@ a@@ th@@ ize , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the tou@@ ch , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se you &apos;ll get con@@ f@@ used and mu@@ dd@@ led . &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , so there is a fe@@ ed@@ back sign@@ al that ve@@ to@@ es the sign@@ al of the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neur@@ on pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing you from con@@ sci@@ ously experienc@@ ing that tou@@ ch ."
"But if you re@@ move the ar@@ m , you simply an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze my ar@@ m , so you put an in@@ jec@@ tion into my ar@@ m , an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze the br@@ achi@@ al ple@@ x@@ us , so the ar@@ m is num@@ b , and there is no sen@@ sa@@ tions coming in , if I now wat@@ ch you being tou@@ ched , I liter@@ ally feel it in my hand ."
"In other words , you have dis@@ sol@@ ved the b@@ ar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings ."
"So , I call them G@@ and@@ h@@ i neurons , or emp@@ a@@ thy neurons ."
( Laughter ) And this is not in some ab@@ str@@ act me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ori@@ cal sense .
"A@@ ll that &apos;s se@@ par@@ ating you from him , from the other person , is your sk@@ in ."
"@@ Re@@ move the sk@@ in , you experience that person &apos;s tou@@ ch in your mind ."
You &apos;ve dis@@ sol@@ ved the b@@ ar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings .
"And this , of course , is the bas@@ is of much of E@@ a@@ ster@@ n ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y , and that is there is no real in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent self , al@@ o@@ of from other human be@@ ings , in@@ spec@@ ting the world , in@@ spec@@ ting other people ."
"You are , in fact , connec@@ ted not just vi@@ a F@@ ace@@ book and In@@ ter@@ net , you &apos;re actually quite liter@@ ally connec@@ ted by your neurons ."
"And there is whole c@@ ha@@ ins of neurons around this room , talking to each other ."
And there is no real dist@@ in@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ ess of your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness from somebody else &apos;s con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
And this is not m@@ um@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ um@@ b@@ o ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y .
It e@@ mer@@ g@@ es from our underst@@ anding of ba@@ sic neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence .
"So , you have a pati@@ ent with a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b . I@@ f the ar@@ m has been re@@ mo@@ ved and you have a ph@@ an@@ tom , and you wat@@ ch somebody else being tou@@ ched , you feel it in your ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"Now the a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ shing thing is , if you have pa@@ in in your ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b , you s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze the other person &apos;s hand , ma@@ s@@ sage the other person &apos;s hand , that reli@@ ev@@ es the pa@@ in in your ph@@ an@@ tom hand , almost as though the neur@@ on were ob@@ ta@@ ining reli@@ e@@ f from mer@@ ely wat@@ ching somebody else being ma@@ s@@ sa@@ g@@ ed ."
"So , here you have my last sli@@ de ."
F@@ or the lon@@ gest time people have re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded science and hum@@ an@@ i@@ ties as being dist@@ in@@ ct .
"C@@ .@@ P@@ . S@@ now sp@@ o@@ ke of the two cul@@ tures : science on the one hand , hum@@ an@@ i@@ ties on the other ; never the tw@@ a@@ in sh@@ all me@@ et ."
"So , I &apos;m saying the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neur@@ on system under@@ lies the inter@@ face allo@@ wing you to re@@ think about is@@ su@@ es like con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ta@@ tion of self , what se@@ par@@ ates you from other human be@@ ings , what allo@@ ws you to emp@@ a@@ th@@ ize with other human be@@ ings , and also even things like the e@@ mer@@ g@@ ence of culture and ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , which is uni@@ qu@@ e to human be@@ ings . Thank you ."

"It &apos;s a great hon@@ or today to share with you The D@@ i@@ g@@ ital Uni@@ verse , which was cre@@ ated for hum@@ an@@ ity to really see where we are in the universe ."
And so I think we can ro@@ ll the vi@@ de@@ o that we have .
&#91; The H@@ im@@ ala@@ y@@ as . &#93; ( M@@ u@@ sic ) The fl@@ at h@@ or@@ iz@@ on that we &apos;ve ev@@ olved with has been a me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or for the in@@ fin@@ ite : un@@ b@@ oun@@ ded re@@ sour@@ ces and un@@ lim@@ ited cap@@ ac@@ ity for di@@ sp@@ os@@ al of wa@@ st@@ e .
"It was@@ n &apos;t until we really left Earth , got ab@@ ove the at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here and had se@@ en the h@@ or@@ iz@@ on b@@ end back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a lim@@ ited con@@ dition ."
The D@@ i@@ g@@ ital Uni@@ verse A@@ t@@ l@@ as has been built at the American M@@ u@@ se@@ um of N@@ atur@@ al H@@ i@@ story over the past 12 years .
"We ma@@ in@@ tain that , put that together as a pro@@ ject to really char@@ t the universe across all sc@@ al@@ es ."
"What we see here are s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ tes around the Earth and the Earth in pro@@ per re@@ gi@@ stra@@ tion against the universe , as we see ."
N@@ A@@ S@@ A supp@@ or@@ ted this work 12 years ago as part of the re@@ buil@@ ding of the H@@ a@@ y@@ d@@ en P@@ lan@@ et@@ ari@@ um so that we would share this with the world .
The D@@ i@@ g@@ ital Uni@@ verse is the bas@@ is of our space show produc@@ tions that we do — our ma@@ in space sho@@ ws in the d@@ ome .
"But what you see here is the resul@@ t of , actually , inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps that we h@@ os@@ ted with L@@ in@@ k@@ op@@ ing Uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity in S@@ wed@@ en ."
"I &apos;ve had 12 students work on this for their gra@@ du@@ ate work , and the resul@@ t has been this so@@ f@@ tw@@ are called Uni@@ view and a comp@@ any called S@@ C@@ I@@ S@@ S in S@@ wed@@ en ."
"This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are allo@@ ws inter@@ ac@@ tive use , so this ac@@ tu@@ al f@@ light p@@ ath and mo@@ vi@@ e that we see here was actually f@@ lo@@ wn live ."
"I cap@@ tu@@ red this live from my l@@ ap@@ top in a ca@@ fe called Earth M@@ at@@ ters on the L@@ o@@ wer E@@ a@@ st S@@ i@@ de of M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an , where I live , and it was done as a col@@ l@@ ab@@ or@@ ative pro@@ ject with the R@@ u@@ b@@ in M@@ u@@ se@@ um of H@@ im@@ ala@@ y@@ an Ar@@ t for an ex@@ hi@@ bit on com@@ par@@ ative cos@@ mo@@ logy ."
"And so as we move out , we see continu@@ ously from our planet all the way out into the re@@ al@@ m of galaxies , as we see here , li@@ ght@@ -@@ tra@@ vel time , giving you a sense of how far away we are ."
"As we move out , the light from these dist@@ ant galaxies have taken so long , we &apos;re essenti@@ ally bac@@ king up into the past ."
We back so far up we &apos;re fin@@ ally see@@ ing a con@@ ta@@ in@@ ment around us — the af@@ ter@@ g@@ low of the Big Bang .
This is the W@@ M@@ A@@ P mic@@ ro@@ wa@@ ve bac@@ k@@ ground that we see .
"We &apos;ll f@@ ly outside it here , just to see this sort of con@@ ta@@ in@@ ment ."
"If we were outside this , it would almost be me@@ an@@ ing@@ less , in the sense as before time ."
But this our con@@ ta@@ in@@ ment of the vi@@ sible universe .
We know the universe is big@@ ger than that which we can see .
"C@@ om@@ ing back quic@@ kly , we see here the radi@@ o sp@@ here that we j@@ u@@ mp@@ ed out of in the beginning , but these are pos@@ i@@ tions , the l@@ at@@ est pos@@ i@@ tions of ex@@ op@@ lan@@ ets that we &apos;ve m@@ app@@ ed , and our su@@ n here , ob@@ vi@@ ously , with our own solar system ."
"What you &apos;re going to see — we &apos;re going to have to j@@ um@@ p in here pretty quic@@ kly between se@@ ver@@ al ord@@ ers of ma@@ gn@@ it@@ u@@ de to get down to where we see the solar system — these are the pa@@ ths of V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er 1 , V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er 2 , P@@ i@@ on@@ e@@ er 1@@ 1 and P@@ i@@ on@@ e@@ er 10 , the first four sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft to have left the solar system ."
"C@@ om@@ ing in cl@@ os@@ er , pic@@ king up Earth , or@@ bit of the M@@ o@@ on , and we see the Earth ."
"This ma@@ p can be up@@ d@@ ated , and we can ad@@ d in new data ."
I know D@@ r@@ . C@@ ar@@ ol@@ y@@ n P@@ or@@ c@@ o is the ca@@ mer@@ a P@@ .@@ I@@ .
for the C@@ as@@ sin@@ i mis@@ sion .
"But here we see the comple@@ x tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory of the C@@ as@@ sin@@ i mis@@ sion col@@ or co@@ ded for different mis@@ sion p@@ ha@@ ses , ing@@ en@@ i@@ ously developed so that 45 en@@ coun@@ ters with the lar@@ gest moon , T@@ it@@ an , which is lar@@ ger that the planet M@@ er@@ cur@@ y , di@@ ver@@ ts the or@@ bit into different parts of mis@@ sion p@@ ha@@ se ."
This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are allo@@ ws us to come cl@@ ose and look at parts of this .
This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are can also be ne@@ t@@ worked between dom@@ es .
"We have a gro@@ wing us@@ er b@@ ase of this , and we ne@@ t@@ work dom@@ es ."
And we can ne@@ t@@ work between dom@@ es and cla@@ ss@@ ro@@ oms .
We &apos;re actually sh@@ ar@@ ing t@@ ours of the universe with the first sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an plan@@ et@@ ari@@ um in G@@ h@@ an@@ a as well as new li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies that have been built in the gh@@ et@@ to@@ s in C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a and a high school in C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ a .
And the C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ ans have actually contro@@ l@@ led the H@@ a@@ y@@ d@@ en P@@ lan@@ et@@ ari@@ um from their high school .
"This is an i@@ ma@@ ge from S@@ atur@@ day , ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ed by the A@@ qu@@ a s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te , but through the Uni@@ view so@@ f@@ tw@@ are ."
So you &apos;re see@@ ing the ed@@ ge of the Earth .
This is Ne@@ p@@ al .
"This is , in fact , right here is the v@@ al@@ ley of L@@ ha@@ s@@ a , right here in T@@ i@@ be@@ t ."
But we can see the ha@@ ze from fi@@ res and so for@@ th in the G@@ ang@@ es v@@ al@@ ley down be@@ low in India .
This is Ne@@ p@@ al and T@@ i@@ be@@ t .
"And just in cl@@ os@@ ing , I &apos;d just like to say this beautiful world that we live on — here we see a bit of the s@@ now that some of you may have had to bra@@ ve in coming out — so I &apos;d like to just say that what the world ne@@ e@@ ds now is a sense of being able to look at our@@ selves in this much lar@@ ger con@@ dition now and a much lar@@ ger sense of what home is ."
"Because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essenti@@ ally ."
We car@@ ry that in us .
"And to be able to see our cont@@ ex@@ t in this lar@@ ger sense at all sc@@ al@@ es hel@@ ps us all , I think , in underst@@ anding where we are and who we are in the universe ."
Thank you .

"And S@@ m@@ it@@ h says , how would you respon@@ d ?"
How do they diff@@ er from the rest of us ?
"In two of the three great ar@@ en@@ as of life , by the time L@@ en was 30 , L@@ en was en@@ orm@@ ously success@@ ful ."
"B@@ y the time he was 20 , he was an op@@ tions tra@@ der ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , in pl@@ ay , he &apos;s a national c@@ ha@@ mp@@ i@@ on bri@@ dge play@@ er ."
"And the reason he was , was that L@@ en is a co@@ ld fi@@ sh ."
What you get out of that is not s@@ mi@@ le@@ y-@@ ness .

"This is the most v@@ ener@@ able of the happ@@ in@@ ess@@ es , tra@@ di@@ tion@@ ally ."
"Now , O@@ K , you can op@@ en your ey@@ es ."
"And we ask the question as a fun@@ c@@ tion of the three different lives , how much life sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion do you get ?"
The pur@@ su@@ it of me@@ an@@ ing is the stron@@ gest .
There &apos;s a group of people in K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
Pe@@ ople c@@ ross o@@ ce@@ ans to go see them .
These people are t@@ all .
They j@@ um@@ p high . They we@@ ar red .
And they k@@ ill li@@ ons .
"You might be wonder@@ ing , who are these people ?"
These are the Ma@@ as@@ a@@ is .
And you know what &apos;s c@@ ool ? I &apos;m actually one of them .
"The Ma@@ as@@ a@@ is , the bo@@ ys are br@@ ought up to be war@@ ri@@ ors ."
The girls are br@@ ought up to be mo@@ thers .
"When I was five years old , I found out that I was eng@@ ag@@ ed to be marri@@ ed as so@@ on as I re@@ ach@@ ed pub@@ er@@ ty ."
"M@@ y mother , my grand@@ mother , my a@@ un@@ ties , they con@@ st@@ an@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me that your h@@ us@@ b@@ and just pas@@ sed by ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ ool , ye@@ a@@ h ?"
And everything I had to do from that moment was to pre@@ p@@ are me to be a per@@ fe@@ ct woman at age 12 .
"M@@ y day started at 5 in the mor@@ ning , mil@@ king the co@@ ws , s@@ wee@@ p@@ ing the h@@ ou@@ se , c@@ oo@@ king for my si@@ bl@@ ings , col@@ lec@@ ting water , fi@@ re@@ w@@ ood ."
I did everything that I needed to do to become a per@@ fe@@ ct wi@@ fe .
I went to school not because the Ma@@ as@@ a@@ is &apos; women or girls were going to school .
"It &apos;s because my mother was d@@ en@@ i@@ ed an education , and she con@@ st@@ an@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me and my si@@ bl@@ ings that she never wanted us to live the life she was li@@ ving ."
Why did she say that ?
M@@ y father worked as a poli@@ ce@@ man in the c@@ ity .
He came home once a year .
We didn &apos;t see him for some@@ times even two years .
"And wh@@ en@@ ever he came home , it was a different case ."
M@@ y mother worked hard in the far@@ m to grow c@@ rop@@ s so that we can e@@ at .
She re@@ ar@@ ed the co@@ ws and the go@@ at@@ s so that she can care for us .
"But when my father came , he would s@@ ell the co@@ ws , he would s@@ ell the produc@@ ts we had , and he went and dr@@ ank with his fri@@ ends in the b@@ ar@@ s ."
"Because my mother was a woman , she was not allowed to own any pro@@ per@@ ty , and by de@@ fa@@ ult , everything in my family any@@ way be@@ lon@@ gs to my father , so he had the right ."
"And if my mother ever ques@@ tion@@ ed him , he be@@ at her , ab@@ used her , and really it was difficult ."
"When I went to school , I had a dre@@ am ."
I wanted to become a teacher .
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers looked n@@ ice .
"They we@@ ar n@@ ice dre@@ ss@@ es , high@@ -@@ he@@ el@@ ed sho@@ es ."
"I found out later that they are un@@ com@@ for@@ table , but I ad@@ mi@@ red it ."
"( Laughter ) But most of all , the teacher was just wr@@ iting on the bo@@ ard — not hard work , that &apos;s what I thought , com@@ par@@ ed to what I was doing in the far@@ m ."
So I wanted to become a teacher .
"I worked hard in school , but when I was in ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de , it was a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ing fac@@ tor ."
"In our tra@@ dition , there is a cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y that girls have to under@@ go to become women , and it &apos;s a r@@ ite of pas@@ sage to wom@@ an@@ h@@ ood ."
"And then I was just fin@@ i@@ shing my ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de , and that was a tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion for me to go to high school ."
This was the c@@ ros@@ s@@ ro@@ ad .
"O@@ n@@ ce I go through this tra@@ dition , I was going to become a wi@@ fe ."
"Well , my dre@@ am of be@@ coming a teacher will not come to pas@@ s ."
So I tal@@ ked — I had to come up with a pl@@ an to fig@@ ure these things out .
I tal@@ ked to my father . I did something that most girls have never done .
"I told my father , &quot; &quot; I will only go through this cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y if you let me go back to school . &quot; &quot; The reason why , if I r@@ an away , my father will have a sti@@ g@@ m@@ a , people will be call@@ ing him the father of that girl who didn &apos;t go through the cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y ."
It was a s@@ ha@@ me@@ ful thing for him to car@@ ry the rest of his life .
"So he fi@@ gu@@ red out . &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; o@@ kay , you &apos;ll go to school after the cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y . &quot; &quot; I did . The cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y happened ."
It &apos;s a whole wee@@ k long of exc@@ it@@ ement .
It &apos;s a cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y . Pe@@ ople are en@@ jo@@ ying it .
"And the day before the ac@@ tu@@ al cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y happens , we were d@@ anc@@ ing , having exc@@ it@@ ement , and through all the ni@@ ght we did not s@@ le@@ ep ."
"The ac@@ tu@@ al day came , and we wal@@ ked out of the h@@ ou@@ se that we were d@@ anc@@ ing in . Y@@ es , we d@@ anc@@ ed and d@@ anc@@ ed ."
"We wal@@ ked out to the cour@@ t@@ y@@ ard , and there were a b@@ un@@ ch of people wa@@ iting ."
They were all in a circ@@ le .
"And as we d@@ anc@@ ed and d@@ anc@@ ed , and we appro@@ ach@@ ed this circ@@ le of women , men , women , children , everybody was there ."
"There was a woman s@@ it@@ ting in the mi@@ ddle of it , and this woman was wa@@ iting to hold us ."
"I was the first . There were my sist@@ ers and a couple of other girls , and as I appro@@ ach@@ ed her , she looked at me , and I s@@ at down ."
"And I s@@ at down , and I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ gs ."
"As I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ g , another woman came , and this woman was car@@ r@@ ying a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And as she car@@ ri@@ ed the k@@ ni@@ fe , she wal@@ ked to@@ ward me and she hel@@ d the c@@ lit@@ or@@ is , and she c@@ ut it off ."
"As you can imagine , I b@@ led . I b@@ led ."
"A@@ f@@ ter b@@ le@@ ed@@ ing for a while , I fa@@ in@@ ted ther@@ e@@ after ."
"It &apos;s something that so many girls — I &apos;m l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , I never di@@ ed — but many di@@ e ."
"It &apos;s pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed , it &apos;s no an@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a , it &apos;s a ru@@ st@@ y old k@@ ni@@ fe , and it was difficult ."
"I was l@@ uc@@ k@@ y because one , also , my mo@@ m did something that most women don &apos;t do ."
"Th@@ ree da@@ ys later , after everybody has left the home , my mo@@ m went and br@@ ought a n@@ ur@@ se ."
We were taken care of .
"Th@@ ree wee@@ ks later , I was heal@@ ed , and I was back in high school ."
I was so de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family .
"Well , while I was in high school , something happened ."
I me@@ t a young g@@ ent@@ le@@ man from our village who had been to the Uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of O@@ re@@ g@@ on .
"This man was w@@ ear@@ ing a wh@@ ite t@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t , j@@ e@@ ans , ca@@ mer@@ a , wh@@ ite s@@ ne@@ a@@ k@@ ers — and I &apos;m talking about wh@@ ite s@@ ne@@ a@@ k@@ ers ."
"There is something about c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , I think , and sho@@ es ."
"They were s@@ ne@@ a@@ k@@ ers , and this is in a village that doesn &apos;t even have pa@@ ved ro@@ a@@ ds . It was quite at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive ."
"I told him , &quot; &quot; Well , I want to go to where you are , &quot; &quot; because this man looked very happy , and I ad@@ mi@@ red that ."
"And he told me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you mean , you want to go ?"
"D@@ on &apos;t you have a h@@ us@@ b@@ and wa@@ iting for you ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that part ."
"@@ J@@ ust tell me how to get there . &quot; &quot; This g@@ ent@@ le@@ man , he hel@@ p@@ ed me ."
"Wh@@ ile I was in high school also , my d@@ ad was sic@@ k ."
"He got a stro@@ ke , and he was really , really sic@@ k , so he really cou@@ ldn &apos;t tell me what to do next ."
"But the problem is , my father is not the only father I have ."
"E@@ very@@ body who is my d@@ ad &apos;s age , m@@ ale in the comm@@ unity , is my father by de@@ fa@@ ult — my un@@ c@@ les , all of them — and they dic@@ t@@ ate what my future is ."
"So the news came , I app@@ li@@ ed to school and I was ac@@ cep@@ ted to R@@ and@@ ol@@ ph@@ -@@ M@@ ac@@ on W@@ om@@ an &apos;s C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in L@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ bur@@ g , V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and I cou@@ ldn &apos;t come without the supp@@ ort of the village , because I needed to ra@@ ise money to buy the air tic@@ k@@ et ."
I got a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship but I needed to get my@@ self here .
"But I needed the supp@@ ort of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had g@@ ot@@ ten an op@@ p@@ ort@@ unity to go to school , they said , &quot; &quot; What a l@@ ost op@@ p@@ ort@@ unity ."
This should have been gi@@ ven to a bo@@ y . We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; So I went back and I had to go back to the tra@@ dition .
There &apos;s a belie@@ f am@@ ong our people that mor@@ ning br@@ ings good news .
"So I had to come up with something to do with the mor@@ ning , because there &apos;s good news in the mor@@ ning ."
"And in the village also , there is one ch@@ i@@ e@@ f , an el@@ der , who if he says y@@ es , everybody will fol@@ low him ."
"So I went to him very early in the mor@@ ning , as the su@@ n r@@ ose ."
"The first thing he se@@ es when he op@@ ens his do@@ or is , it &apos;s me ."
"&quot; M@@ y child , what are you doing here ? &quot;"
"&quot; Well , D@@ ad , I need help . C@@ an you supp@@ ort me to go to America ? &quot;"
"I pr@@ om@@ ised him that I would be the best girl , I will come back , anything they wanted after that , I will do it for them ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , but I can &apos;t do it al@@ one . &quot; &quot; He gave me a li@@ st of another 15 men that I went — 1@@ 6 more men — every single mor@@ ning I went and vi@@ s@@ ited them ."
They all came together .
"The village , the women , the men , everybody came together to supp@@ ort me to come to get an education ."
"I ar@@ ri@@ ved in America . A@@ s you can imagine , what did I find ?"
I found s@@ now !
"I found W@@ al@@ -@@ M@@ ar@@ ts , v@@ ac@@ u@@ um c@@ le@@ an@@ ers , and lots of f@@ ood in the ca@@ fe@@ ter@@ ia ."
I was in a land of pl@@ ent@@ y .
"I en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed my@@ self , but d@@ uring that moment while I was here , I disco@@ ver@@ ed a lot of things ."
"I learned that that cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y that I went through when I was 1@@ 3 years old , it was called fe@@ m@@ ale gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ la@@ tion ."
I learned that it was against the la@@ w in K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
I learned that I did not have to tra@@ de part of my body to get an education . I had a right .
"And as we spea@@ k right now , three million girls in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a are at ri@@ s@@ k of going through this mu@@ ti@@ la@@ tion ."
I learned that my mo@@ m had a right to own pro@@ per@@ ty .
I learned that she did not have to be ab@@ used because she is a woman .
Th@@ ose things made me an@@ gr@@ y .
I wanted to do something .
"As I went back , every time I went , I found that my ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors &apos; girls were getting marri@@ ed ."
"They were getting mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated , and here , after I gra@@ du@@ ated from here , I worked at the U.@@ N@@ . , I went back to school to get my gra@@ du@@ ate work , the con@@ st@@ ant c@@ ry of these girls was in my face ."
I had to do something .
"As I went back , I started talking to the men , to the village , and mo@@ thers , and I said , &quot; &quot; I want to give back the way I had pr@@ om@@ ised you that I would come back and help you . What do you need ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s I sp@@ o@@ ke to the women , they told me , &quot; You know what we need ? We really need a school for girls . &quot;"
Because there had not been any school for girls .
"And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is r@@ ap@@ ed when she &apos;s wal@@ king to school , the mother is b@@ la@@ m@@ ed for that ."
"If she got pre@@ gn@@ ant before she got marri@@ ed , the mother is b@@ la@@ m@@ ed for that , and she &apos;s p@@ uni@@ shed ."
She &apos;s be@@ at@@ en .
"They said , &quot; &quot; We wanted to put our girls in a sa@@ fe place . &quot; &quot; A@@ s we mo@@ ved , and I went to talk to the fa@@ thers , the fa@@ thers , of course , you can imagine what they said : &quot; We want a school for bo@@ ys . &quot;"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have g@@ ot@@ ten an education ."
"Wh@@ y can &apos;t they build a school for bo@@ ys , and I &apos;ll build a school for girls ? &quot; &quot; That made sense . And they ag@@ re@@ ed ."
"And I told them , I wanted them to show me a si@@ gn of comm@@ it@@ ment ."
And they did . They d@@ on@@ ated land where we built the girls &apos; school .
We have .
I want you to me@@ et one of the girls in that school .
"A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ ine came to app@@ ly for the school , and she did not me@@ et any c@@ r@@ it@@ eri@@ a that we had ."
"She &apos;s an or@@ p@@ ha@@ n . Y@@ es , we could have taken her for that ."
"But she was ol@@ der . She was 12 years old , and we were ta@@ king girls who were in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
"A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ ine had been mo@@ ving from one place — because she &apos;s an or@@ p@@ ha@@ n , she has no mother , she has no father — mo@@ ving from one grand@@ mother &apos;s h@@ ou@@ se to another one , from a@@ un@@ ties to a@@ un@@ ties . She had no st@@ ab@@ i@@ lity in her life ."
"And I looked at her , I remem@@ ber that day , and I saw something be@@ y@@ on@@ d what I was see@@ ing in An@@ g@@ el@@ ine ."
"And y@@ es , she was ol@@ der to be in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
We gave her the op@@ p@@ ort@@ unity to come to the cla@@ ss .
"F@@ i@@ ve months later , that is An@@ g@@ el@@ ine ."
A trans@@ formation had be@@ gu@@ n in her life .
An@@ g@@ el@@ ine wan@@ ts to be a p@@ il@@ o@@ t so she can f@@ ly around the world and make a difference .
She was not the top stud@@ ent when we took her .
"Now she &apos;s the best stud@@ ent , not just in our school , but in the enti@@ re divi@@ sion that we are in ."
That &apos;s S@@ har@@ on . That &apos;s five years later .
"That &apos;s E@@ vel@@ y@@ n . F@@ i@@ ve months later , that is the difference that we are making ."
"As a new da@@ wn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening ."
"As we spea@@ k right now , 1@@ 2@@ 5 girls will never be mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated ."
One hundred tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five girls will not be marri@@ ed when they &apos;re 12 years old .
One hundred tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five girls are cre@@ ating and achi@@ ev@@ ing their dre@@ a@@ ms .
"This is the thing that we are doing , giving them op@@ p@@ ort@@ uni@@ ties where they can ri@@ se ."
"As we spea@@ k right now , women are not being be@@ at@@ en because of the re@@ v@@ olu@@ tions we &apos;ve started in our comm@@ unity ."
( Applause ) I want to chall@@ en@@ ge you today .
"You are li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to me because you are here , very op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic ."
You are somebody who is so pas@@ sion@@ ate .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see a better world .
"You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see that war ends , no po@@ ver@@ ty ."
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make a difference .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make our tom@@ or@@ row better .
"I want to chall@@ en@@ ge you today that to be the first , because people will fol@@ low you ."
B@@ e the first . Pe@@ ople will fol@@ low you .
B@@ e bo@@ ld . St@@ and up . B@@ e f@@ ear@@ less . B@@ e con@@ fi@@ dent .
"M@@ ove out , because as you change your world , as you change your comm@@ unity , as we believe that we are imp@@ ac@@ ting one girl , one family , one village , one country at a time ."
"We are making a difference , so if you change your world , you are going to change your comm@@ unity , you are going to change your country , and think about that . I@@ f you do that , and I do that , ar@@ en &apos;t we going to create a better future for our children , for your children , for our grand@@ children ?"
And we will live in a very pe@@ ace@@ ful world . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I have a question for you : A@@ re you religi@@ ous ?
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religi@@ ous person .
"@@ Let &apos;s see , I &apos;d say about three or four percent ."
I had no idea there were so many belie@@ ver@@ s at a TED Con@@ fer@@ ence .
"( Laughter ) O@@ kay , here &apos;s another question : Do you think of yourself as sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al in any way , shape or form ? R@@ a@@ ise your hand ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity ."
M@@ y T@@ al@@ k today is about self-@@ tr@@ an@@ sc@@ end@@ ence .
It &apos;s just a ba@@ sic fact about being human that some@@ times the self seems to just m@@ el@@ t away .
"And when that happens , the feel@@ ing is ec@@ st@@ ati@@ c and we re@@ ach for me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors of up and down to explain these feel@@ ings ."
We talk about being up@@ li@@ f@@ ted or el@@ ev@@ ated .
Now it &apos;s really hard to think about anything ab@@ str@@ act like this without a good con@@ cre@@ te me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
So here &apos;s the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or I &apos;m off@@ ering today .
"Th@@ ink about the mind as being like a h@@ ou@@ se with many ro@@ oms , most of which we &apos;re very fami@@ li@@ ar with ."
But some@@ times it &apos;s as though a do@@ or@@ way appe@@ ar@@ s from out of no@@ where and it op@@ ens on@@ to a stair@@ case .
We c@@ lim@@ b the stair@@ case and experience a state of al@@ ter@@ ed con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
"In 19@@ 0@@ 2 , the great American psycho@@ logi@@ st W@@ illi@@ am J@@ am@@ es wr@@ ote about the many v@@ ari@@ e@@ ties of religi@@ ous experience ."
He col@@ lec@@ ted all kinds of case studies .
"One of the most exc@@ iting to me is this young man , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ ra@@ d@@ ley , had an en@@ coun@@ ter , he thought , with J@@ es@@ us in 18@@ 20 ."
And here &apos;s what B@@ ra@@ d@@ ley said about it .
"( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ ra@@ d@@ ley : I thought I saw the sa@@ vi@@ or in human shape for about one second in the room , with ar@@ ms ex@@ ten@@ ded , appe@@ ar@@ ing to say to me , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome . &quot; &quot; The next day I re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ing ."
M@@ y happiness was so great that I said I wanted to di@@ e .
This world had no place in my a@@ ffec@@ tions .
"@@ P@@ re@@ vi@@ ous to this time , I was very sel@@ fi@@ sh and self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous ."
"But now I desi@@ red the w@@ el@@ f@@ are of all man@@ kind and could , with a feel@@ ing heart , for@@ give my wor@@ st ene@@ mi@@ es ."
"@@ J@@ H : So n@@ ote how B@@ ra@@ d@@ ley &apos;s pe@@ tty , mor@@ al@@ is@@ tic self just di@@ es on the way up the stair@@ case ."
And on this high@@ er level he be@@ comes lo@@ ving and for@@ giving .
The world &apos;s many religi@@ ons have found so many ways to help people c@@ lim@@ b the stair@@ case .
O@@ thers use psy@@ che@@ de@@ li@@ c dru@@ gs .
This is from a 1@@ 6@@ th century A@@ z@@ te@@ c sc@@ ro@@ ll sho@@ wing a man about to e@@ at a p@@ si@@ loc@@ y@@ b@@ in mu@@ sh@@ room and at the same moment get y@@ an@@ ked up the stair@@ case by a go@@ d .
L@@ ots of people find self-@@ tr@@ an@@ sc@@ end@@ ence in nature .
O@@ thers o@@ ver@@ come their self at ra@@ ves .
But here &apos;s the we@@ ir@@ de@@ st place of all : war .
"So many b@@ oo@@ ks about war say the same thing , that nothing br@@ ings people together like war ."
And that br@@ ing@@ ing them together op@@ ens up the pos@@ sibi@@ lity of ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary self-@@ tr@@ an@@ sc@@ end@@ ent experienc@@ es .
I &apos;m going to pl@@ ay for you an ex@@ cer@@ p@@ t from this book by G@@ l@@ en@@ n G@@ r@@ ay .
G@@ r@@ ay was a sol@@ di@@ er in the American ar@@ my in World War I@@ I .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) G@@ l@@ en@@ n G@@ r@@ ay : M@@ any ve@@ ter@@ ans will ad@@ m@@ it that the experience of comm@@ un@@ al e@@ ff@@ ort in b@@ att@@ le has been the high point of their lives .
"&quot; I &quot; pas@@ ses in@@ sen@@ si@@ b@@ ly into a &quot; we , &quot; &quot; my &quot; be@@ comes &quot; our &quot; and in@@ divi@@ du@@ al fa@@ it@@ h l@@ os@@ es its cen@@ tr@@ al import@@ ance ."
I believe that it is nothing less than the as@@ sur@@ ance of im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity that makes self-@@ s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice at these mom@@ ents so rela@@ tively easy .
"I may f@@ all , but I do not di@@ e , for that which is real in me goes for@@ ward and lives on in the com@@ ra@@ des for wh@@ om I gave up my life ."
It feel@@ s some@@ how up@@ li@@ f@@ ting .
This idea that we move up was cen@@ tr@@ al in the wr@@ iting of the great F@@ r@@ en@@ ch soci@@ o@@ logi@@ st E@@ mi@@ le D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ i@@ m .
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ i@@ m even called us H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x , or tw@@ o@@ -@@ level man ."
The lo@@ wer level he called the level of the prof@@ an@@ e .
Now prof@@ an@@ e is the op@@ pos@@ ite of s@@ ac@@ red .
It just means ordin@@ ary or common .
And in our ordin@@ ary lives we ex@@ ist as in@@ divi@@ du@@ als .
We want to sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y our in@@ divi@@ du@@ al desi@@ res .
We pur@@ sue our in@@ divi@@ du@@ al go@@ als .
But some@@ times something happens that tri@@ g@@ g@@ ers a p@@ ha@@ se change .
"I@@ n@@ divi@@ du@@ als un@@ ite into a te@@ am , a move@@ ment or a n@@ ation , which is far more than the su@@ m of its parts ."
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ i@@ m called this level the level of the s@@ ac@@ red because he beli@@ ev@@ ed that the fun@@ c@@ tion of religi@@ on was to un@@ ite people into a group , into a moral comm@@ unity ."
D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ i@@ m beli@@ ev@@ ed that anything that un@@ it@@ es us ta@@ kes on an air of s@@ ac@@ re@@ d@@ ness .
"And once people circ@@ le around some s@@ ac@@ red ob@@ ject or valu@@ e , they &apos;ll then work as a te@@ am and fi@@ ght to de@@ f@@ end it ."
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ i@@ m wr@@ ote about a set of int@@ en@@ se col@@ lec@@ tive e@@ mo@@ tions that ac@@ comp@@ lish this m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le of E pl@@ u@@ ri@@ b@@ us un@@ um , of making a group out of in@@ divi@@ du@@ als ."
Th@@ ink of the col@@ lec@@ tive jo@@ y in B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in on the day World War I@@ I en@@ ded .
"Th@@ ink of the col@@ lec@@ tive an@@ ger in T@@ a@@ h@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are , which br@@ ought down a dic@@ t@@ at@@ or ."
So let me su@@ m@@ mar@@ ize where we are .
I &apos;m off@@ ering the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or of a stair@@ case in the mind .
I &apos;m saying we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x and this stair@@ case ta@@ kes us up from the prof@@ an@@ e level to the level of the s@@ ac@@ red .
So here &apos;s the m@@ illi@@ on@@ -@@ dol@@ lar question for social scienti@@ sts like me : I@@ s the stair@@ case a fe@@ ature of our ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary desi@@ gn ?
"I@@ s it a produc@@ t of natural sel@@ ec@@ tion , like our h@@ ands ?"
Well many scienti@@ sts who study religi@@ on take this view .
"The New A@@ the@@ ist@@ s , for example , ar@@ gu@@ e that religi@@ on is a set of mem@@ es , sort of par@@ a@@ si@@ tic mem@@ es , that get inside our min@@ ds and make us do all kinds of c@@ ra@@ z@@ y religi@@ ous stuff , self-@@ de@@ struc@@ tive stuff , like su@@ ici@@ de bomb@@ ing ."
"And after all , how could it ever be good for us to l@@ ose our@@ selves ?"
How could it ever be ad@@ ap@@ tive for any organ@@ ism to o@@ ver@@ come self-@@ inter@@ est ?
Well let me show you .
"In &quot; &quot; The D@@ es@@ cent of M@@ an , &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in wr@@ ote a great de@@ al about the evolution of mor@@ ality — where did it come from , why do we have it ."
"D@@ ar@@ w@@ in n@@ ot@@ ed that many of our vir@@ tu@@ es are of very little use to our@@ selves , but they &apos;re of great use to our groups ."
But really the way to think about this is as multi@@ level sel@@ ec@@ tion .
So look at it this way : You &apos;ve got com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion going on within groups and across groups .
So here &apos;s a group of gu@@ ys on a college cre@@ w te@@ am .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in this te@@ am there &apos;s com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion .
There are gu@@ ys com@@ pe@@ ting with each other .
"The s@@ lo@@ we@@ st ro@@ w@@ ers , the we@@ a@@ ke@@ st ro@@ w@@ ers , are going to get c@@ ut from the te@@ am ."
And only a few of these gu@@ ys are going to go on in the sp@@ ort .
"So within the te@@ am , their interest@@ s are actually p@@ it@@ ted against each other ."
And some@@ times it would be adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge@@ ous for one of these gu@@ ys to try to s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age the other gu@@ ys .
Ma@@ ybe he &apos;ll b@@ ad@@ m@@ ou@@ th his ch@@ i@@ e@@ f ri@@ val to the co@@ ach .
"But while that com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion is going on within the bo@@ at , this com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion is going on across bo@@ at@@ s ."
They can only w@@ in if they all pul@@ l together as a te@@ am .
"I mean , these things sound tr@@ ite , but they are de@@ ep ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary tru@@ ths ."
Let me il@@ lu@@ str@@ ate this for you .
"S@@ u@@ pp@@ ose we &apos;ve got a group of little organ@@ is@@ ms — they can be bac@@ ter@@ ia , they can be ha@@ m@@ st@@ ers ; it doesn &apos;t matter what — and let &apos;s supp@@ ose that this little group here , they ev@@ olved to be co@@ op@@ er@@ ative ."
"And as you &apos;ll see in this si@@ m@@ ulation , as they inter@@ act they ga@@ in poin@@ ts , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve d@@ ou@@ b@@ led in si@@ ze , you &apos;ll see them sp@@ li@@ t , and that &apos;s how they re@@ pro@@ duce and the population gro@@ ws ."
"We start with just one gre@@ en , and as it inter@@ ac@@ ts it ga@@ ins we@@ al@@ th or poin@@ ts or f@@ ood ."
"And in sh@@ ort order , the co@@ op@@ er@@ at@@ ors are done for ."
The fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ d@@ ers have taken over .
I@@ f a group cannot sol@@ ve the fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ der problem then it cannot rea@@ p the bene@@ f@@ its of co@@ op@@ er@@ ation and group sel@@ ec@@ tion cannot get started .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
"In fact , nature has sol@@ ved it many , many times ."
And nature &apos;s fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite s@@ olution is to put everyone in the same bo@@ at .
"For example , why is it that the m@@ it@@ o@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ a in every cell has its own D@@ N@@ A , t@@ ot@@ ally se@@ par@@ ate from the D@@ N@@ A in the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us ?"
It &apos;s because they used to be se@@ par@@ ate fre@@ e-@@ li@@ ving bac@@ ter@@ ia and they came together and be@@ came a super@@ organ@@ ism .
A super@@ organ@@ ism can ba@@ sically take what it wan@@ ts .
And pretty so@@ on the whole population is actually comp@@ osed of these new super@@ organ@@ is@@ ms .
What I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you here is some@@ times called a ma@@ j@@ or tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion in ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary history .
"D@@ ar@@ w@@ in &apos;s la@@ ws don &apos;t change , but now there &apos;s a new kind of play@@ er on the field and things beg@@ in to look very different ."
"It happened again about 1@@ 20 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some so@@ lit@@ ary was@@ ps beg@@ an cre@@ ating little simple , pri@@ mi@@ tive ne@@ sts , or hi@@ ves ."
"And it happened again , even more spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ arly , in the last hal@@ f-@@ million years when our own an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors be@@ came cul@@ tur@@ al cre@@ atures , they came together around a hear@@ th or a ca@@ mp@@ fire , they divi@@ ded l@@ ab@@ or , they beg@@ an pain@@ ting their bo@@ di@@ es , they sp@@ o@@ ke their own di@@ al@@ ec@@ ts , and even@@ tually they wor@@ shi@@ p@@ ed their own go@@ ds ."
"O@@ n@@ ce they were all in the same tri@@ be , they could keep the bene@@ f@@ its of co@@ op@@ er@@ ation loc@@ ked inside ."
"And they un@@ loc@@ ked the most po@@ wer@@ ful force ever known on this planet , which is human co@@ op@@ er@@ ation — a force for con@@ struc@@ tion and de@@ struc@@ tion ."
L@@ ook at the people in these ph@@ ot@@ os I &apos;ve been sho@@ wing you .
Do you think they &apos;re there pur@@ su@@ ing their self-@@ inter@@ est ?
"O@@ r are they pur@@ su@@ ing comm@@ un@@ al inter@@ est , which re@@ qui@@ res them to l@@ ose the@@ m@@ selves and become simply a part of a whole ?"
"O@@ kay , so that was my T@@ al@@ k de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed in the st@@ and@@ ard TED way ."
And now I &apos;m going to give the whole T@@ al@@ k over again in three minutes in a more ful@@ l@@ -@@ spec@@ tru@@ m sort of way .
"( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) J@@ on@@ a@@ than H@@ a@@ i@@ d@@ t : We hum@@ ans have many v@@ ari@@ e@@ ties of religi@@ ous experience , as W@@ illi@@ am J@@ am@@ es expla@@ ined ."
One of the most common is c@@ lim@@ b@@ ing the se@@ cre@@ t stair@@ case and l@@ os@@ ing our@@ selves .
"The stair@@ case ta@@ kes us from the experience of life as prof@@ an@@ e or ordin@@ ary up@@ wards to the experience of life as s@@ ac@@ red , or de@@ e@@ p@@ ly inter@@ connec@@ ted ."
"We are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x , as D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ i@@ m expla@@ ined ."
"And we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x because we ev@@ olved by multi@@ level sel@@ ec@@ tion , as D@@ ar@@ w@@ in expla@@ ined ."
"If it is an ad@@ ap@@ ta@@ tion , then we ev@@ olved to be religi@@ ous ."
"I mean that we ev@@ olved to see s@@ ac@@ re@@ d@@ ness all around us and to jo@@ in with others into te@@ a@@ ms and circ@@ le around s@@ ac@@ red ob@@ jec@@ ts , people and ideas ."
This is why poli@@ tics is so tri@@ b@@ al .
"@@ P@@ o@@ li@@ tics is par@@ tly prof@@ an@@ e , it &apos;s par@@ tly about self-@@ inter@@ est , but poli@@ tics is also about s@@ ac@@ re@@ d@@ ness ."
It &apos;s about jo@@ ining with others to pur@@ sue moral ideas .
"It &apos;s about the e@@ ter@@ n@@ al str@@ u@@ g@@ gle between good and evi@@ l , and we all believe we &apos;re on the good te@@ am ."
"And most import@@ an@@ tly , if the stair@@ case is real , it expla@@ ins the per@@ sist@@ ent under@@ cur@@ r@@ ent of dis@@ sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion in modern life ."
"Because human be@@ ings are , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , hi@@ vi@@ sh cre@@ atures like be@@ es ."
We &apos;re be@@ es . We bu@@ st@@ ed out of the hi@@ ve d@@ uring the En@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment .
We bro@@ ke down the old in@@ sti@@ tu@@ tions and br@@ ought liber@@ ty to the op@@ press@@ ed .
No@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys we f@@ ly around like in@@ divi@@ du@@ al be@@ es ex@@ ul@@ ting in our fre@@ e@@ dom .
But some@@ times we won@@ der : I@@ s this all there is ?
What should I do with my life ?
What &apos;s mi@@ ss@@ ing ?
"What &apos;s mi@@ ss@@ ing is that we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x , but modern , se@@ c@@ ular society was built to sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y our lo@@ wer , prof@@ an@@ e selves ."
It &apos;s really com@@ for@@ table down here on the lo@@ wer level .
"C@@ ome , have a se@@ at in my home en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment cen@@ ter ."
One great chall@@ en@@ ge of modern life is to find the stair@@ case a@@ mi@@ d all the clu@@ t@@ ter and then to do something good and no@@ ble once you c@@ lim@@ b to the top .
I see this desi@@ re in my students at the Uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
They all want to find a cause or call@@ ing that they can th@@ row the@@ m@@ selves into .
They &apos;re all sear@@ ching for their stair@@ case .
M@@ ost people long to o@@ ver@@ come pe@@ tt@@ iness and become part of something lar@@ ger .
And this expla@@ ins the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary re@@ s@@ on@@ ance of this simple me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or con@@ j@@ u@@ red up ne@@ arly 4@@ 00 years ago .
&quot; &quot; No man is an is@@ land enti@@ re of itself .

( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk today about the ple@@ as@@ ures of every@@ day life .
But I want to beg@@ in with a story of an un@@ u@@ su@@ al and ter@@ ri@@ ble man .
This is H@@ er@@ man@@ n G@@ o@@ ering .
"@@ G@@ o@@ ering was H@@ it@@ l@@ er &apos;s second in comm@@ and in World War I@@ I , his de@@ sign@@ ated success@@ or ."
"And like H@@ it@@ l@@ er , G@@ o@@ ering f@@ an@@ ci@@ ed hi@@ m@@ self a col@@ lec@@ tor of ar@@ t ."
"H@@ it@@ l@@ er had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any ."
And it was his fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite ar@@ t@@ work ever .
"@@ World War I@@ I came to an end , and G@@ o@@ ering was cap@@ tu@@ red , tried at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely s@@ ent@@ enc@@ ed to de@@ ath ."
Th@@ en the A@@ l@@ li@@ ed for@@ ces went through his col@@ lec@@ tions and found the pa@@ int@@ ings and went after the people who so@@ ld it to him .
"@@ V@@ an M@@ e@@ e@@ g@@ er@@ en was char@@ g@@ ed with the cri@@ me of tre@@ as@@ on , which is itself p@@ uni@@ s@@ ha@@ ble by de@@ ath ."
"S@@ i@@ x wee@@ ks into his pri@@ son s@@ ent@@ ence , v@@ an M@@ e@@ e@@ g@@ er@@ en con@@ f@@ ess@@ ed ."
But he didn &apos;t con@@ f@@ ess to tre@@ as@@ on .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I did not s@@ ell a great ma@@ ster@@ piece to that N@@ a@@ z@@ i ."
I pain@@ ted it my@@ self ; I &apos;m a for@@ ger . &quot; &quot; Now no@@ body beli@@ ev@@ ed him .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll pro@@ ve it ."
"B@@ r@@ ing me a can@@ v@@ as and some pain@@ t , and I will pain@@ t a V@@ er@@ me@@ er much better than I so@@ ld that dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing N@@ a@@ z@@ i ."
He pain@@ ted a beautiful V@@ er@@ me@@ er .
And then the char@@ g@@ es of tre@@ as@@ on were dro@@ pp@@ ed .
"He had a le@@ ss@@ er char@@ ge of for@@ g@@ ery , got a year s@@ ent@@ ence and di@@ ed a her@@ o to the D@@ u@@ t@@ ch people ."
"There &apos;s a lot more to be said about v@@ an M@@ e@@ e@@ g@@ er@@ en , but I want to turn now to G@@ o@@ ering , who &apos;s pic@@ tu@@ red here being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g ."
"Now G@@ o@@ ering was , by all ac@@ coun@@ ts , a ter@@ ri@@ ble man ."
H@@ is American inter@@ ro@@ g@@ at@@ ors describ@@ ed him as an a@@ mi@@ ca@@ ble psy@@ ch@@ op@@ ath .
He had disco@@ ver@@ ed after all that the pain@@ ting he thought was this was actually that .
It was@@ n &apos;t just him who was in for a sho@@ ck .
"In particular , &quot; &quot; The Su@@ pp@@ er at E@@ m@@ ma@@ us &quot; &quot; which was vie@@ wed as V@@ er@@ me@@ er &apos;s fin@@ est ma@@ ster@@ piece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a for@@ g@@ ery ."
"It was not that pain@@ ting , but that pain@@ ting ."
"And when that was disco@@ ver@@ ed , it l@@ ost all its valu@@ e and was taken away from the mu@@ se@@ um ."
Why does this matter ?
I &apos;m a psycho@@ logi@@ sts — why do ori@@ g@@ ins matter so much ?
Why do we respon@@ d so much to our kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge of where something comes from ?
Well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
"M@@ any soci@@ o@@ logi@@ sts like V@@ e@@ bl@@ en and W@@ ol@@ fe would ar@@ gu@@ e that the reason why we take ori@@ g@@ ins so ser@@ i@@ ously is because we &apos;re s@@ no@@ b@@ s , because we &apos;re fo@@ c@@ used on st@@ at@@ us ."
"A@@ m@@ ong other things , if you want to show off how rich you are , how po@@ wer@@ ful you are , it &apos;s always better to own an ori@@ g@@ in@@ al than a for@@ g@@ ery because there &apos;s always going to be fe@@ wer ori@@ g@@ in@@ als than for@@ g@@ er@@ ies ."
"@@ that hum@@ ans are , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , natural born essenti@@ al@@ ist@@ s ."
"What I mean by this is we don &apos;t just respon@@ d to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ ther , our respon@@ se is con@@ di@@ tion@@ ed on our belie@@ f@@ s , about what they really are , what they came from , what they &apos;re made of , what their hi@@ dd@@ en nature is ."
"I want to sug@@ gest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we re@@ act to things ."
"So I want to sug@@ gest that ple@@ as@@ ure is de@@ ep — and that this isn &apos;t true just for high@@ er level ple@@ as@@ ures like ar@@ t , but even the most see@@ min@@ g@@ ly simple ple@@ as@@ ures are a@@ ffec@@ ted by our belie@@ f@@ s about hi@@ dd@@ en ess@@ ences ."
So take f@@ ood .
W@@ ould you e@@ at this ?
"Well , a good answer is , &quot; &quot; It dep@@ ends . What is it ? &quot; &quot; S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s p@@ or@@ k , but not be@@ e@@ f ."
F@@ ew of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s a r@@ at or a human .
S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it only if it &apos;s a stran@@ ge@@ ly co@@ lo@@ red piece of to@@ f@@ u .
That &apos;s not so surpri@@ sing .
But what &apos;s more interesting is how it ta@@ st@@ es to you will dep@@ end cri@@ tic@@ ally on what you think you &apos;re e@@ ating .
So one de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of this was done with young children .
"@@ How do you make children not just be more li@@ ke@@ ly to e@@ at car@@ r@@ ots and dr@@ ink mil@@ k , but to get more ple@@ as@@ ure from e@@ ating car@@ r@@ ots and dr@@ in@@ king mil@@ k — to think they ta@@ st@@ e better ?"
How do you get ad@@ ul@@ ts to really en@@ jo@@ y w@@ ine ?
This was rec@@ ently done with a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c tw@@ ist .
In fron@@ t of them on a s@@ cre@@ en is information about the w@@ ine .
"E@@ very@@ body , of course , dr@@ in@@ ks ex@@ actly the same w@@ ine ."
"But if you believe you &apos;re dr@@ in@@ king exp@@ en@@ sive stuff , parts of the brain as@@ soci@@ ated with ple@@ as@@ ure and re@@ ward light up like a Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as t@@ ree ."
"It &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more ple@@ as@@ ur@@ able , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way ."
O@@ r take sex .
These are sti@@ mul@@ i I &apos;ve used in some of my studies .
"And if you simply show people these pic@@ tures , they &apos;ll say these are fa@@ ir@@ ly at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive people ."
"You probably think the picture on the left is m@@ ale , the one on the right is fe@@ m@@ ale ."
"If that belie@@ f turns out to be mi@@ sta@@ ken , it will make a difference ."
"It will make a difference if you were to disco@@ ver that the person you &apos;re looking at with l@@ ust is actually a dis@@ gu@@ ised ver@@ sion of your son or daughter , your mother or father ."
"If you like somebody , they look better to you ."
This is why sp@@ ous@@ es in happy marri@@ ag@@ es t@@ end to think that their h@@ us@@ b@@ and or wi@@ fe looks much better than any@@ one else thin@@ ks that they do .
( Laughter ) A partic@@ ul@@ arly d@@ ra@@ ma@@ tic example of this comes from a ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logical dis@@ order known as C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome .
So C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is a dis@@ order where you get a speci@@ fi@@ c d@@ el@@ u@@ sion .
"Now o@@ f@@ ten , a resul@@ t of C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is tra@@ gi@@ c ."
But there &apos;s at lea@@ st one case where C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome had a happy en@@ ding .
This was rec@@ ord@@ ed in 19@@ 3@@ 1 .
The golf clu@@ b@@ s were ow@@ ned by Jo@@ h@@ n F@@ . K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy and so@@ ld for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of a million dollars at a@@ uc@@ tion .
The bub@@ ble gu@@ m was che@@ wed up by po@@ p star B@@ r@@ it@@ ne@@ y S@@ pe@@ ar@@ s and so@@ ld for se@@ ver@@ al hund@@ re@@ ds of dollars .
"And in fact , there &apos;s a th@@ ri@@ ving mark@@ et in the par@@ ti@@ ally e@@ at@@ en f@@ ood of be@@ lo@@ ved people ."
( Laughter ) The sho@@ es are perhaps the most valu@@ able of all .
"A@@ cc@@ ord@@ ing to an un@@ con@@ fir@@ m@@ ed rep@@ ort , a S@@ au@@ d@@ i m@@ illi@@ on@@ a@@ ir@@ e off@@ er@@ ed 10 million dollars for this pa@@ ir of sho@@ es ."
They were the ones th@@ ro@@ wn at G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h at an I@@ ra@@ q@@ i pre@@ ss con@@ fer@@ ence se@@ ver@@ al years ago .
"@@ W@@ it@@ h my colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es G@@ e@@ or@@ ge Ne@@ w@@ man and G@@ il D@@ i@@ es@@ end@@ r@@ uc@@ k , we &apos;ve looked to see what sort of fac@@ tors , what sort of history , mat@@ ters for the ob@@ jec@@ ts that people like ."
"So in one of our experi@@ ments , we asked people to na@@ me a fa@@ m@@ ous person who they a@@ do@@ red , a li@@ ving person they a@@ do@@ red ."
So one answer was G@@ e@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey .
"Th@@ en we asked them , &quot; How much would you p@@ ay for G@@ e@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey &apos;s swe@@ ater ? &quot;"
And the answer is a fa@@ ir amount — more than you would p@@ ay for a br@@ and new swe@@ ater or a swe@@ ater ow@@ ned by somebody who you didn &apos;t ad@@ ore .
Th@@ en we asked other groups of sub@@ jec@@ ts — we gave them different re@@ stri@@ c@@ tions and different con@@ di@@ tions .
"So for inst@@ ance , we told some people , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , you can buy the swe@@ ater , but you can &apos;t tell any@@ body you own it , and you can &apos;t re@@ s@@ ell it . &quot; &quot; That d@@ rop@@ s the valu@@ e of it , sug@@ ge@@ st@@ ing that that &apos;s one reason why we like it ."
"But what really ca@@ us@@ es an effec@@ t is you tell people , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , you could re@@ s@@ ell it , you could bo@@ a@@ st about it , but before it gets to you , it &apos;s th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly wa@@ shed . &quot; &quot; That ca@@ us@@ es a hu@@ ge dro@@ p in the valu@@ e ."
"As my wi@@ fe put it , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve wa@@ shed away the C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey c@@ oo@@ ties . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s go back to ar@@ t ."
"But I don &apos;t want a du@@ p@@ lica@@ te , even if I can &apos;t tell the difference ."
"That &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , I &apos;m a s@@ no@@ b and want to bo@@ a@@ st about having an ori@@ g@@ in@@ al ."
Wh@@ o here li@@ kes the work of J@@ ac@@ k@@ son P@@ ol@@ loc@@ k ?
"O@@ kay . Wh@@ o here , it does nothing for them ?"
They just don &apos;t like it .
And they then rep@@ or@@ ted that her father was co@@ ach@@ ing her .
"When this came out on t@@ el@@ evi@@ sion , the valu@@ e of her ar@@ t dro@@ pp@@ ed to nothing ."
"It was the same ar@@ t , physic@@ ally , but the history had chang@@ ed ."
So he got J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell to take his million dol@@ lar viol@@ in down to a W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ . sub@@ way st@@ ation and st@@ and in the cor@@ ner and see how much money he would make .
And here &apos;s a bri@@ e@@ f c@@ li@@ p of this .
"( V@@ i@@ ol@@ in music ) A@@ f@@ ter being there for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of an h@@ our , he made 3@@ 2 dollars ."
No@@ t bad . It &apos;s also not good .
"A@@ p@@ par@@ ently to really en@@ jo@@ y the music of J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell , you have to know you &apos;re li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell ."
Because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the vi@@ de@@ o — she comes up .
So she &apos;s st@@ un@@ ned that he &apos;s st@@ anding in a sub@@ way st@@ ation .
So she &apos;s struc@@ k with p@@ ity .
She re@@ ach@@ es into her pur@@ se and h@@ ands him a 20 .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The second example from music is from Jo@@ h@@ n C@@ age &apos;s moder@@ ni@@ st comp@@ os@@ ition , &quot; 4 &apos; 3@@ 3 &quot; . &quot;"
And people have different vie@@ ws on this .
But what I want to point out is you can buy this from i@@ T@@ un@@ es .
"( Laughter ) F@@ or a dol@@ lar 9@@ 9 , you can li@@ st@@ en to that si@@ l@@ ence , which is different than other for@@ ms of si@@ l@@ ence . ( Laughter )"
"Now I &apos;ve been talking so far about ple@@ as@@ ure , but what I want to sug@@ gest is that everything I &apos;ve said app@@ lies as well to pa@@ in ."
"And how you think about what you &apos;re experienc@@ ing , your belie@@ f@@ s about the ess@@ ence of it , a@@ ffec@@ t how it h@@ ur@@ ts ."
One lo@@ vely experiment was done by K@@ ur@@ t G@@ r@@ ay and D@@ an W@@ e@@ gn@@ er .
And they gave them a ser@@ ies of pain@@ ful electri@@ c sho@@ c@@ ks .
So it was a ser@@ ies of five pain@@ ful sho@@ c@@ ks .
"The second sho@@ ck feel@@ s less pain@@ ful , because you get a bit used to it ."
"The th@@ ir@@ d d@@ rop@@ s , the f@@ our@@ th , the fi@@ f@@ th ."
The pa@@ in gets less .
"In the other con@@ dition , they &apos;re told that the person in the next room is sho@@ c@@ king them on pur@@ p@@ ose — kno@@ ws they &apos;re sho@@ c@@ king them ."
The first sho@@ ck h@@ ur@@ ts like h@@ ell .
"The second sho@@ ck h@@ ur@@ ts just as much , and the th@@ ir@@ d and the f@@ our@@ th and the fi@@ f@@ th ."
"The most extre@@ me example of this is that in some ca@@ ses , pa@@ in under the right circ@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es can trans@@ form into ple@@ as@@ ure ."
"The point was n@@ ic@@ ely su@@ m@@ mar@@ iz@@ ed by the po@@ et Jo@@ h@@ n M@@ il@@ ton who wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; The mind is its own place , and in itself can make a he@@ a@@ ven of h@@ ell , a h@@ ell of he@@ a@@ ven . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ll end with that . Thank you ."
( Applause )
And fin@@ ally I en@@ ded up en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing psycho@@ logy by chan@@ ce .
"I was at a sk@@ i re@@ sort in S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land without any money to actually en@@ jo@@ y my@@ self , because the s@@ now had m@@ el@@ ted and I didn &apos;t have money to go to a mo@@ vi@@ e . But I found that on the — I read in the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers that there was to be a pre@@ sen@@ ta@@ tion by someone in a place that I &apos;d se@@ en in the cen@@ ter of Z@@ u@@ rich , and it was about fl@@ ying sa@@ uc@@ ers &#91; that &#93; he was going to talk ."
And the man who tal@@ ked at that even@@ ing lec@@ ture was very interesting .
And this see@@ m@@ ed very interesting to me .
And I started read@@ ing his b@@ oo@@ ks after that lec@@ ture .
"And that was C@@ ar@@ l J@@ un@@ g , wh@@ ose na@@ me or work I had no idea about ."
Th@@ en I came to this country to study psycho@@ logy and I started trying to understand the ro@@ ots of happiness .
"This is a t@@ y@@ pi@@ cal resul@@ t that many people have pre@@ sen@@ ted , and there are many v@@ ari@@ ations on it ."
"But this , for inst@@ ance , sho@@ ws that about 30 percent of the people sur@@ ve@@ y@@ ed in the United States since 19@@ 5@@ 6 say that their life is very happy ."
And that ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t chang@@ ed at all .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the per@@ s@@ onal income , on a sc@@ ale that has been hel@@ d con@@ st@@ ant to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ate for in@@ f@@ la@@ tion , has more than d@@ ou@@ b@@ led , almost tri@@ pl@@ ed , in that peri@@ od ."
"But you find essenti@@ ally the same results , na@@ me@@ ly , that after a certain ba@@ sic point — which cor@@ respon@@ ds more or less to just a few 1@@ ,000 dollars ab@@ ove the min@@ im@@ um po@@ ver@@ ty level — increas@@ es in material well-being don &apos;t seem to a@@ ffec@@ t how happy people are ."
"In fact , you can find that the l@@ ack of ba@@ sic re@@ sour@@ ces , material re@@ sour@@ ces , con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes to un@@ happiness , but the increase in material re@@ sour@@ ces does not increase happiness ."
"So my resear@@ ch has been fo@@ c@@ used more on — after fin@@ ding out these things that actually cor@@ respon@@ ded to my own experience , I tried to understand : where — in every@@ day life , in our n@@ orm@@ al experience — do we feel really happy ?"
"And to start those studies about 40 years ago , I beg@@ an to look at cre@@ ative people — first arti@@ sts and scienti@@ sts , and so for@@ th — trying to understand what made them feel that it was wor@@ th essenti@@ ally sp@@ en@@ ding their life doing things for which many of them didn &apos;t expe@@ ct ei@@ ther fa@@ me or for@@ t@@ un@@ e , but which made their life me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful and wor@@ th doing ."
This was one of the lead@@ ing comp@@ os@@ ers of American music back in the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
And the inter@@ view was 40 p@@ ag@@ es long .
But this little ex@@ cer@@ p@@ t is a very good su@@ m@@ mar@@ y of what he was saying d@@ uring the inter@@ view .
And it describ@@ es how he feel@@ s when comp@@ os@@ ing is going well .
And he says by describ@@ ing it as an ec@@ st@@ ati@@ c state .
"Now , &quot; &quot; ec@@ st@@ asy &quot; &quot; in G@@ re@@ e@@ k me@@ ant simply to st@@ and to the side of something ."
And then it be@@ came essenti@@ ally an an@@ al@@ o@@ gy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordin@@ ary every@@ day r@@ out@@ ines .
So ec@@ st@@ asy is essenti@@ ally a ste@@ pp@@ ing into an al@@ ter@@ nati@@ ve reality .
"And it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ations that we look up to as having been p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ les of human achi@@ ev@@ ement — whether it &apos;s China , G@@ re@@ ece , the H@@ in@@ d@@ u ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , or the Ma@@ y@@ as , or E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ ans — what we know about them is really about their ec@@ sta@@ si@@ es , not about their every@@ day life ."
"We know the te@@ mp@@ les they built , where people could come to experience a different reality ."
"We know about the circ@@ us@@ es , the ar@@ en@@ as , the the@@ at@@ ers ."
"Th@@ ese are the re@@ ma@@ ins of ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ations and they are the pl@@ ac@@ es that people went to experience life in a more con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated , more ord@@ er@@ ed form ."
"Now , this man doesn &apos;t need to go to a place like this , which is also — this place , this ar@@ en@@ a , which is built like a G@@ re@@ e@@ k a@@ mp@@ hi@@ the@@ at@@ re , is a place for ec@@ st@@ asy also ."
We are par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating in a reality that is different from that of the every@@ day life that we &apos;re used to .
But this man doesn &apos;t need to go there .
"He ne@@ e@@ ds just a piece of p@@ ap@@ er where he can put down little mar@@ ks , and as he does that , he can imagine s@@ oun@@ ds that had not exist@@ ed before in that particular com@@ b@@ in@@ ation ."
"So once he gets to that point of beginning to create , like J@@ en@@ ni@@ f@@ er did in her impro@@ vi@@ sa@@ tion , a new reality — that is , a moment of ec@@ st@@ asy — he en@@ ters that different reality ."
Now he says also that this is so int@@ en@@ se an experience that it feel@@ s almost as if he didn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
And that s@@ oun@@ ds like a kind of a r@@ om@@ an@@ tic ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ation .
"But actually , our ner@@ v@@ ous system is in@@ cap@@ able of proc@@ ess@@ ing more than about 1@@ 10 b@@ its of information per second ."
"And in order to hear me and understand what I &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 b@@ its per second ."
That &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear more than two people .
You can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
"Well , when you are really inv@@ olved in this comple@@ tely eng@@ ag@@ ing process of cre@@ ating something new , as this man is , he doesn &apos;t have enough att@@ en@@ tion left over to mon@@ it@@ or how his body feel@@ s , or his problems at home ."
He can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s h@@ un@@ gr@@ y or ti@@ red .
"H@@ is body dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s , his i@@ d@@ enti@@ ty dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s from his con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , because he doesn &apos;t have enough att@@ en@@ tion , like n@@ one of us do , to really do well something that re@@ qui@@ res a lot of con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion , and at the same time to feel that he exist@@ s ."
So exist@@ ence is te@@ mp@@ or@@ ari@@ ly su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded .
And he says that his hand seems to be mo@@ ving by itself .
"Now , I could look at my hand for two wee@@ ks , and I wouldn &apos;t feel any a@@ we or won@@ der , because I can &apos;t comp@@ ose . ( Laughter ) So what it &apos;s t@@ elling you here is that ob@@ vi@@ ously this au@@ tom@@ ati@@ c , spon@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous process that he &apos;s describ@@ ing can only happen to someone who is very well tra@@ ined and who has developed tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e ."
And it has become a kind of a tru@@ ism in the study of cre@@ ati@@ vity that you can &apos;t be cre@@ ating anything with less than 10 years of tech@@ n@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge im@@ mer@@ sion in a particular field .
"Wh@@ ether it &apos;s ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics or music , it ta@@ kes that long to be able to beg@@ in to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before ."
"Now , when that happens , he says the music just f@@ lo@@ ws out ."
And because all of these people I started inter@@ vie@@ wing — this was an inter@@ view which is over 30 years old — so many of the people describ@@ ed this as a spon@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous f@@ low that I called this t@@ yp@@ e of experience the &quot; &quot; f@@ low experience . &quot; &quot; And it happens in different re@@ al@@ ms .
"For inst@@ ance , a po@@ et describ@@ es it in this form ."
This is by a stud@@ ent of m@@ ine who inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the lead@@ ing wr@@ it@@ ers and po@@ ets in the United States .
"And it describ@@ es the same e@@ ff@@ ort@@ less , spon@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous feel@@ ing that you get when you en@@ ter into this ec@@ st@@ ati@@ c state ."
"This po@@ et describ@@ es it as op@@ en@@ ing a do@@ or that f@@ lo@@ at@@ s in the sk@@ y — a very si@@ mil@@ ar descri@@ p@@ tion to what A@@ l@@ ber@@ t E@@ instein gave as to how he imag@@ ined the for@@ ces of rela@@ ti@@ vity , when he was str@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling with trying to understand how it worked ."
But it happens in other acti@@ vi@@ ties .
"For inst@@ ance , this is another stud@@ ent of m@@ ine , S@@ us@@ an J@@ ac@@ k@@ son from A@@ u@@ str@@ ali@@ a , who did work with some of the lead@@ ing a@@ th@@ le@@ tes in the world ."
"And you see here in this descri@@ p@@ tion of an O@@ l@@ y@@ mp@@ ic sk@@ ater , the same essenti@@ al descri@@ p@@ tion of the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ o@@ logy of the in@@ ner state of the person ."
"You don &apos;t think ; it goes au@@ tom@@ ati@@ c@@ ally , if you mer@@ ge yourself with the music , and so for@@ th ."
"It happens also , actually , in the most re@@ cent book I wr@@ ote , called &quot; &quot; G@@ ood B@@ usiness , &quot; &quot; where I inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had been n@@ om@@ in@@ ated by their pe@@ ers as being both very success@@ ful and very e@@ th@@ i@@ cal , very soci@@ ally respon@@ sible ."
You see that these people de@@ f@@ ine success as something that hel@@ ps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are wor@@ king at it .
"And like all of these success@@ ful and respon@@ sible C@@ E@@ O@@ s say , you can &apos;t have just one of these things be success@@ ful if you want a me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful and success@@ ful job ."
An@@ it@@ a R@@ o@@ d@@ dic@@ k is another one of these C@@ E@@ O@@ s we inter@@ vie@@ wed .
"She is the f@@ oun@@ der of B@@ o@@ dy S@@ h@@ o@@ p , the natural cos@@ me@@ tics king ."
It &apos;s kind of a pas@@ sion that comes from doing the best and having f@@ low while you &apos;re wor@@ king .
"This is an interesting little quot@@ e from M@@ as@@ ar@@ u I@@ bu@@ k@@ a , who was at that time star@@ ting out S@@ on@@ y without any money , without a produc@@ t — they didn &apos;t have a produc@@ t , they didn &apos;t have anything , but they had an idea ."
"And the idea he had was to est@@ ab@@ lish a place of work where engine@@ ers can feel the jo@@ y of techno@@ logical in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , be a@@ w@@ are of their mis@@ sion to society and work to their heart &apos;s cont@@ ent ."
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t impro@@ ve on this as a good example of how f@@ low en@@ ters the wor@@ k@@ place .
"Now , when we do studies — we have , with other colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es around the world , done over 8@@ ,000 inter@@ vie@@ ws of people — from D@@ om@@ in@@ ican mon@@ ks , to bl@@ ind n@@ un@@ s , to H@@ im@@ ala@@ y@@ an c@@ lim@@ bers , to N@@ a@@ va@@ j@@ o sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ ds — who en@@ jo@@ y their work ."
"And re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the culture , re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of education or wh@@ at@@ ever , there are these se@@ ven con@@ di@@ tions that seem to be there when a person is in f@@ low ."
"You know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s , you for@@ get yourself , you feel part of something lar@@ ger ."
"And once the con@@ di@@ tions are pres@@ ent , what you are doing be@@ comes wor@@ th doing for its own sa@@ ke ."
"In our studies , we re@@ pres@@ ent the every@@ day life of people in this simple sch@@ e@@ me ."
"And we can measure this very preci@@ se@@ ly , actually , because we give people electr@@ on@@ ic p@@ ag@@ ers that go off 10 times a day , and wh@@ en@@ ever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about ."
And two things that we measure is the amount of chall@@ en@@ ge people experience at that moment and the amount of sk@@ ill that they feel they have at that moment .
"So for each person we can est@@ ab@@ lish an average , which is the cen@@ ter of the di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m ."
"That would be your mean level of chall@@ en@@ ge and sk@@ ill , which will be different from that of any@@ body else ."
"But you have a kind of a set point there , which would be in the mi@@ ddle ."
"If we know what that set point is , we can pre@@ di@@ ct fa@@ ir@@ ly ac@@ cur@@ ately when you will be in f@@ low , and it will be when your chall@@ eng@@ es are high@@ er than average and sk@@ il@@ ls are high@@ er than average ."
And then the other are@@ as become less and less pos@@ itive .
Ar@@ ous@@ al is still good because you are o@@ ver@@ -@@ chall@@ eng@@ ed there .
"C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l is also a good place to be , because there you feel com@@ for@@ table , but not very exc@@ ited ."
It &apos;s not very chall@@ eng@@ ing any more .
"And if you want to en@@ ter f@@ low from contro@@ l , you have to increase the chall@@ eng@@ es ."
So those two are ide@@ al and comple@@ m@@ ent@@ ary are@@ as from which f@@ low is easy to go into .
The other com@@ b@@ in@@ ations of chall@@ en@@ ge and sk@@ ill become progre@@ s@@ si@@ vely less op@@ tim@@ al .
"B@@ o@@ re@@ dom beg@@ ins to be very a@@ ver@@ sive and ap@@ a@@ thy be@@ comes very ne@@ g@@ ative : you don &apos;t feel that you &apos;re doing anything , you don &apos;t use your sk@@ il@@ ls , there &apos;s no chall@@ en@@ ge ."
"The lar@@ gest single con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tor to that experience is wat@@ ching t@@ el@@ evi@@ sion ; the next one is being in the ba@@ th@@ room , s@@ it@@ ting ."
"E@@ ven though some@@ times wat@@ ching t@@ el@@ evi@@ sion about se@@ ven to eight percent of the time is in f@@ low , but that &apos;s when you cho@@ ose a progra@@ m you really want to wat@@ ch and you get fe@@ ed@@ back from it ."
So the question we are trying to ad@@ dre@@ ss — and I &apos;m way over time — is how to put more and more of every@@ day life in that f@@ low chan@@ ne@@ l .
And that is the kind of chall@@ en@@ ge that we &apos;re trying to understand .
"And some of you ob@@ vi@@ ously know how to do that spon@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously without any adv@@ ice , but un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately a lot of people don &apos;t ."
"And that &apos;s what our m@@ and@@ ate is , in a way , to do ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I have an inter@@ est in education .
S@@ ha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are being se@@ ven ?
"I &apos;ve got two kids ; he &apos;s 2@@ 1 now , my daughter &apos;s 1@@ 6 ."
He didn &apos;t want to come to L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es .
"They &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life ."
The brain isn &apos;t divi@@ ded into com@@ par@@ t@@ ments .
"Because you are , ar@@ en &apos;t you ?"
"If I &apos;m c@@ oo@@ king , the do@@ or is sh@@ ut , the kids are out , the ph@@ one &apos;s on the h@@ ook , if she comes in I get an@@ no@@ y@@ ed ."
"T@@ a@@ ke her to a d@@ ance school . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What happened ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; She did . I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was ."
We wal@@ ked in this room and it was ful@@ l of people like me .
Pe@@ ople who had to move to think . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o had to move to think .
"We are built out of very small stuff , and we are em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in a very lar@@ ge cos@@ mo@@ s , and the fact is that we are not very good at underst@@ anding reality at ei@@ ther of those sc@@ al@@ es , and that &apos;s because our bra@@ ins ha@@ ven &apos;t ev@@ olved to understand the world at that sc@@ ale ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , we &apos;re tr@@ app@@ ed on this very th@@ in sli@@ ce of per@@ cep@@ tion right in the mi@@ ddle ."
So take the col@@ ors of our world .
But we &apos;re not see@@ ing all the wa@@ ves out there .
"In fact , what we see is less than a 10 tri@@ l@@ li@@ on@@ th of what &apos;s out there ."
"Now , it &apos;s not that these things are in@@ her@@ ently un@@ see@@ able ."
"S@@ na@@ kes in@@ clu@@ de some in@@ fr@@ ar@@ ed in their reality , and hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es in@@ clu@@ de ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let in their view of the world , and of course we build mach@@ ines in the da@@ sh@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds of our car@@ s to pic@@ k up on sign@@ als in the radi@@ o fre@@ qu@@ enc@@ y ran@@ ge , and we built mach@@ ines in h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als to pic@@ k up on the X@@ -@@ r@@ ay ran@@ ge ."
"But you can &apos;t sense any of those by yourself , at lea@@ st not yet , because you don &apos;t come equ@@ i@@ pp@@ ed with the pro@@ per sen@@ s@@ ors ."
"Now , what this means is that our experience of reality is con@@ stra@@ ined by our bio@@ logy , and that goes against the common sense no@@ tion that our ey@@ es and our ear@@ s and our fin@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are just pic@@ king up the ob@@ jec@@ tive reality that &apos;s out there ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , our bra@@ ins are sa@@ mp@@ ling just a little bit of the world ."
"So in the bl@@ ind and de@@ a@@ f world of the tic@@ k , the important sign@@ als are te@@ m@@ per@@ ature and bu@@ t@@ y@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id ; in the world of the black gh@@ ost k@@ ni@@ fe@@ fi@@ sh , its sen@@ s@@ ory world is la@@ vi@@ sh@@ ly co@@ lo@@ red by electri@@ cal fiel@@ ds ; and for the e@@ cho@@ lo@@ ca@@ ting b@@ at , its reality is con@@ struc@@ ted out of air com@@ pres@@ sion wa@@ ves ."
"That &apos;s the sli@@ ce of their ec@@ os@@ y@@ ste@@ m that they can pic@@ k up on , and we have a word for this in science ."
"Now , pre@@ su@@ m@@ ably , every an@@ im@@ al as@@ su@@ m@@ es that its um@@ w@@ el@@ t is the enti@@ re ob@@ jec@@ tive reality out there , because why would you ever stop to imagine that there &apos;s something be@@ y@@ on@@ d what we can sense ."
Let &apos;s do a con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ne@@ ss@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ er on this .
I@@ mag@@ ine that you are a b@@ loo@@ d@@ h@@ ound do@@ g .
Y@@ our whole world is about sm@@ elling .
"You &apos;ve got a long s@@ n@@ out that has 200 million sc@@ ent re@@ cep@@ tors in it , and you have w@@ et n@@ os@@ tri@@ ls that at@@ tr@@ act and tra@@ p sc@@ ent mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es , and your n@@ os@@ tri@@ ls even have sli@@ ts so you can take big n@@ os@@ e@@ ful@@ s of air ."
E@@ very@@ thing is about sm@@ ell for you .
"So one day , you stop in your tr@@ ac@@ ks with a re@@ vel@@ ation ."
"You look at your human ow@@ ner and you think , &quot; &quot; What is it like to have the pi@@ tiful , imp@@ o@@ ver@@ i@@ shed n@@ ose of a human ?"
( Laughter ) What is it like when you take a fe@@ e@@ ble little n@@ os@@ e@@ ful of air ?
"@@ How can you not know that there &apos;s a c@@ at 100 y@@ ar@@ ds away , or that your ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or was on this very sp@@ o@@ t six h@@ ours ago ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So because we &apos;re hum@@ ans , we &apos;ve never experienc@@ ed that world of sm@@ ell , so we don &apos;t mi@@ ss it , because we are fir@@ m@@ ly se@@ tt@@ led into our um@@ w@@ el@@ t ."
"But the question is , do we have to be st@@ uc@@ k there ?"
"So as a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ st , I &apos;m interest@@ ed in the way that technology might exp@@ and our um@@ w@@ el@@ t , and how that &apos;s going to change the experience of being human ."
"So the way this works is , you take a mic@@ ro@@ ph@@ one and you di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze the sign@@ al , and you put an elec@@ t@@ ro@@ de stri@@ p direc@@ tly into the in@@ ner e@@ ar ."
"Wh@@ y ? It &apos;s because these techno@@ logi@@ es spea@@ k the language of S@@ i@@ li@@ c@@ on V@@ al@@ ley , and it &apos;s not ex@@ actly the same di@@ al@@ ec@@ t as our natural bio@@ logical sense org@@ ans ."
But the fact is that it works ; the brain fi@@ gu@@ res out how to use the sign@@ als just f@@ ine .
"Now , how do we understand that ?"
"Well , here &apos;s the big se@@ cre@@ t : Y@@ our brain is not hear@@ ing or see@@ ing any of this ."
Y@@ our brain is loc@@ ked in a va@@ ult of si@@ l@@ ence and d@@ ar@@ k@@ ness inside your sk@@ ul@@ l .
"A@@ ll it ever se@@ es are elec@@ t@@ ro@@ che@@ mi@@ cal sign@@ als that come in along different data ca@@ b@@ les , and this is all it has to work with , and nothing more ."
And this is a very e@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent kind of mach@@ ine .
"It &apos;s essenti@@ ally a gener@@ al pur@@ p@@ ose compu@@ ting de@@ v@@ ice , and it just ta@@ kes in everything and fi@@ gu@@ res out what it &apos;s going to do with it , and that , I think , fre@@ es up M@@ other N@@ ature to t@@ in@@ ker around with different s@@ orts of in@@ put chan@@ n@@ el@@ s ."
The brain fi@@ gu@@ res out what to do with the data that comes in .
"And when you look across the an@@ im@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom , you find lots of peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al de@@ vic@@ es ."
"So s@@ na@@ kes have he@@ at p@@ its with which to de@@ te@@ ct in@@ fr@@ ar@@ ed , and the gh@@ ost k@@ ni@@ fe@@ fi@@ sh has elec@@ t@@ ro@@ re@@ cep@@ tors , and the star@@ -@@ n@@ osed mo@@ le has this app@@ end@@ age with 2@@ 2 fin@@ g@@ ers on it with which it feel@@ s around and con@@ struc@@ ts a 3@@ D mo@@ de@@ l of the world , and many b@@ ir@@ ds have magne@@ ti@@ te so they can ori@@ ent to the magnetic field of the planet ."
So what this means is that nature doesn &apos;t have to continu@@ ally re@@ desi@@ gn the brain .
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , with the pr@@ inci@@ pl@@ es of brain op@@ er@@ ation est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed , all nature has to wor@@ ry about is de@@ sign@@ ing new peri@@ ph@@ er@@ als ."
O@@ kay . So what this means is this : The le@@ s@@ son that sur@@ fac@@ es is that there &apos;s nothing really spe@@ cial or f@@ und@@ am@@ ental about the bio@@ logy that we come to the table with .
It &apos;s just what we have in@@ her@@ ited from a comple@@ x ro@@ ad of evolution .
"But it &apos;s not what we have to s@@ tic@@ k with , and our best pro@@ of of pr@@ inci@@ ple of this comes from what &apos;s called sen@@ s@@ ory sub@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion ."
"Now , that might sound spec@@ ula@@ tive , but the first p@@ ap@@ er de@@ mon@@ str@@ ating this was published in the j@@ ourn@@ al N@@ ature in 19@@ 6@@ 9 ."
Why the fore@@ head ? Because you &apos;re not using it for much else .
"The most modern in@@ car@@ n@@ ation is called the bra@@ in@@ p@@ ort , and this is a little elec@@ t@@ ro@@ g@@ ri@@ d that s@@ its on your t@@ on@@ gu@@ e , and the vi@@ de@@ o fe@@ ed gets turned into these little electr@@ ot@@ acti@@ le sign@@ als , and bl@@ ind people get so good at using this that they can th@@ row a b@@ all into a bas@@ k@@ et , or they can na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate comple@@ x ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le cour@@ ses ."
They can come to see through their t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
"Now , that s@@ oun@@ ds comple@@ tely in@@ s@@ an@@ e , right ?"
"But remem@@ ber , all vi@@ sion ever is is elec@@ t@@ ro@@ che@@ mi@@ cal sign@@ als cour@@ sing around in your brain ."
Y@@ our brain doesn &apos;t know where the sign@@ als come from .
It just fi@@ gu@@ res out what to do with them .
"And we wanted to do this , gi@@ ven the power and u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity of p@@ ort@@ able compu@@ ting , we wanted to make s@@ ure that this would ru@@ n on cell ph@@ ones and t@@ ab@@ le@@ ts , and also we wanted to make this a w@@ ear@@ able , something that you could we@@ ar under your c@@ lo@@ thing ."
So here &apos;s the con@@ cept .
"So as I &apos;m spea@@ king , my sound is getting cap@@ tu@@ red by the t@@ ab@@ let , and then it &apos;s getting m@@ app@@ ed on@@ to a ve@@ st that &apos;s co@@ ver@@ ed in vibr@@ at@@ ory m@@ ot@@ ors , just like the m@@ ot@@ ors in your cell ph@@ one . So as I &apos;m spea@@ king ,"
the sound is getting trans@@ l@@ ated to a patter@@ n of vi@@ bra@@ tion on the ve@@ st .
"Now , this is not just con@@ cep@@ tu@@ al : this t@@ ab@@ let is trans@@ m@@ it@@ ting B@@ lu@@ e@@ to@@ ot@@ h , and I &apos;m w@@ ear@@ ing the ve@@ st right now ."
So as I &apos;m spea@@ king — ( Applause ) — the sound is getting trans@@ l@@ ated into d@@ y@@ na@@ mic patter@@ ns of vi@@ bra@@ tion .
I &apos;m feel@@ ing the s@@ on@@ ic world around me .
"So , we &apos;ve been test@@ ing this with de@@ a@@ f people now , and it turns out that after just a little bit of time , people can start feel@@ ing , they can start underst@@ anding the language of the ve@@ st ."
So this is J@@ on@@ a@@ than . He &apos;s 3@@ 7 years old . He has a ma@@ ster &apos;s de@@ g@@ ree .
"He was born prof@@ oun@@ dly de@@ a@@ f , which means that there &apos;s a part of his um@@ w@@ el@@ t that &apos;s un@@ a@@ va@@ il@@ able to him ."
"So we had J@@ on@@ a@@ than tra@@ in with the ve@@ st for four da@@ ys , two h@@ ours a day , and here he is on the fi@@ f@@ th day ."
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t No@@ v@@ ich : You .
S@@ N : Wh@@ ere . Wh@@ ere .
D@@ E : J@@ on@@ a@@ than is able to trans@@ l@@ ate this comp@@ lica@@ ted patter@@ n of vi@@ bra@@ tions into an underst@@ anding of what &apos;s being said .
S@@ N : T@@ ou@@ ch . T@@ ou@@ ch .
"Now , this technology has the p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al to be a ga@@ me@@ -@@ chan@@ ger , because the only other s@@ olution for de@@ af@@ ness is a co@@ ch@@ lear imp@@ l@@ ant , and that re@@ qui@@ res an inv@@ a@@ sive sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"And this can be built for 40 times che@@ ap@@ er than a co@@ ch@@ lear imp@@ l@@ ant , which op@@ ens up this technology glob@@ ally , even for the p@@ oo@@ rest countries ."
"Now , we &apos;ve been very en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed by our results with sen@@ s@@ ory sub@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion , but what we &apos;ve been thinking a lot about is sen@@ s@@ ory ad@@ dition ."
"@@ How could we use a technology like this to ad@@ d a comple@@ tely new kind of sense , to exp@@ and the human um@@ vel@@ t ?"
"For example , could we fe@@ ed re@@ al@@ -@@ time data from the In@@ ter@@ net direc@@ tly into somebody &apos;s brain , and can they devel@@ o@@ p a di@@ re@@ ct per@@ cep@@ tu@@ al experience ?"
So here &apos;s an experiment we &apos;re doing in the la@@ b .
"Th@@ en , two bu@@ tt@@ ons appe@@ ar , and he has to make a cho@@ ice ."
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
"He doesn &apos;t know that what we &apos;re fe@@ ed@@ ing is re@@ al@@ -@@ time data from the sto@@ ck mark@@ et , and he &apos;s making buy and s@@ ell deci@@ sions ."
( Laughter ) And the fe@@ ed@@ back is t@@ elling him whether he did the right thing or not .
"And what we &apos;re see@@ ing is , can we exp@@ and the human um@@ vel@@ t so that he comes to have , after se@@ ver@@ al wee@@ ks , a di@@ re@@ ct per@@ cep@@ tu@@ al experience of the economic move@@ ments of the planet ."
So we &apos;ll rep@@ ort on that later to see how well this goes .
"( Laughter ) Here &apos;s another thing we &apos;re doing : D@@ uring the tal@@ ks this mor@@ ning , we &apos;ve been au@@ tom@@ ati@@ c@@ ally sc@@ r@@ ap@@ ing T@@ wit@@ ter for the TE@@ D@@ 20@@ 15 ha@@ sh@@ ta@@ g , and we &apos;ve been doing an au@@ tom@@ ated s@@ enti@@ ment an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , which means , are people using pos@@ itive words or ne@@ g@@ ative words or ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al ?"
"And while this has been going on , I have been feel@@ ing this , and so I am pl@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ed in to the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate e@@ mo@@ tion of thousands of people in real time , and that &apos;s a new kind of human experience , because now I can know how everyone &apos;s doing and how much you &apos;re lo@@ ving this ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a big@@ ger experience than a human can n@@ orm@@ ally have .
We &apos;re also exp@@ anding the um@@ vel@@ t of p@@ il@@ ots .
"So in this case , the ve@@ st is stre@@ am@@ ing n@@ ine different meas@@ ures from this qu@@ ad@@ cop@@ ter , so p@@ it@@ ch and y@@ a@@ w and ro@@ ll and ori@@ en@@ ta@@ tion and he@@ ad@@ ing , and that impro@@ ves this p@@ il@@ o@@ t &apos;s ab@@ i@@ lity to f@@ ly it ."
"It &apos;s essenti@@ ally like he &apos;s ex@@ ten@@ ding his sk@@ in up there , far away ."
And that &apos;s just the beginning .
"What we &apos;re en@@ vi@@ sion@@ ing is ta@@ king a modern co@@ c@@ k@@ p@@ it ful@@ l of g@@ au@@ g@@ es and instead of trying to read the whole thing , you feel it ."
"We live in a world of information now , and there is a difference between acc@@ ess@@ ing big data and experienc@@ ing it ."
So I think there &apos;s really no end to the pos@@ sibi@@ li@@ ties on the h@@ or@@ iz@@ on for human exp@@ an@@ sion .
"@@ J@@ ust imagine an a@@ stron@@ a@@ ut being able to feel the o@@ ver@@ all health of the In@@ ter@@ national S@@ p@@ ace S@@ ta@@ tion , or , for that matter , having you feel the in@@ vi@@ sible st@@ ates of your own health , like your b@@ loo@@ d sug@@ ar and the state of your mic@@ ro@@ bi@@ ome , or having 3@@ 6@@ 0@@ -@@ de@@ g@@ ree vi@@ sion or see@@ ing in in@@ fr@@ ar@@ ed or ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ."
"So the k@@ ey is this : A@@ s we move into the future , we &apos;re going to increas@@ ing@@ ly be able to cho@@ ose our own peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al de@@ vic@@ es ."
"We no longer have to wa@@ it for M@@ other N@@ ature &apos;s sen@@ s@@ ory gi@@ f@@ ts on her tim@@ es@@ cal@@ es , but instead , like any good par@@ ent , she &apos;s gi@@ ven us the to@@ ols that we need to go out and de@@ f@@ ine our own tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory ."
"So the question now is , how do you want to go out and experience your universe ?"
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : C@@ an you feel it ? D@@ E : Y@@ ea@@ h .
"A@@ c@@ tually , this was the first time I f@@ el@@ t app@@ lause on the ve@@ st ."
It &apos;s n@@ ice . It &apos;s like a ma@@ s@@ sage . ( Laughter ) C@@ A : T@@ wit@@ ter &apos;s going c@@ ra@@ z@@ y . T@@ wit@@ ter &apos;s going ma@@ d .
So that sto@@ ck mark@@ et experiment .
"D@@ E : Well , that &apos;s right , I wouldn &apos;t have to wr@@ ite to N@@ I@@ H any@@ more ."
So what that t@@ ells us is that the cor@@ te@@ x is kind of a on@@ e-@@ tri@@ ck p@@ on@@ y .
It just run@@ s certain kinds of compu@@ ta@@ tions on things .
"And when we look around at things like bra@@ il@@ le , for example , people are getting information through bu@@ mp@@ s on their fin@@ g@@ ers ."
So I don &apos;t think we have any reason to think there &apos;s a the@@ o@@ re@@ tical lim@@ it that we know the ed@@ ge of .
"C@@ A : I@@ f this ch@@ ec@@ ks out , you &apos;re going to be d@@ el@@ u@@ g@@ ed ."
There are so many possible app@@ lica@@ tions for this .
"A@@ re you ready for this ? What are you most exc@@ ited about , the direc@@ tion it might go ?"
"So this is a way of just feel@@ ing the state of something , just like the way you know the state of your body as you &apos;re st@@ anding around ."
"So I think he@@ a@@ v@@ y mach@@ in@@ ery , sa@@ fe@@ ty , feel@@ ing the state of a fac@@ t@@ ory , of your equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment , that &apos;s one place it &apos;ll go right away ."
"C@@ A : D@@ a@@ vi@@ d E@@ ag@@ le@@ man , that was one min@@ d@@ -@@ b@@ lo@@ wing talk . Thank you very much ."
"D@@ E : Thank you , Ch@@ r@@ is . ( Applause )"
It &apos;s really a fa@@ il@@ ure to de@@ te@@ ct a certain kind of d@@ an@@ ger .
And that respon@@ se is part of the problem .
"I am un@@ able to mar@@ s@@ ha@@ l this respon@@ se , and I &apos;m giving this talk ."
It &apos;s as though we st@@ and before two do@@ ors .
O@@ ur computer har@@ d@@ w@@ are and so@@ f@@ tw@@ are just st@@ op@@ s getting better for some reason .
Now take a moment to con@@ si@@ der why this might happen .
What could stop us from doing this ?
A ful@@ l@@ -@@ sc@@ ale n@@ uc@@ lear war ?
A global p@@ an@@ de@@ mic ?
A@@ n a@@ ster@@ o@@ id imp@@ act ?
J@@ us@@ ti@@ n Bi@@ e@@ ber be@@ coming pre@@ si@@ dent of the United States ?
But that isn &apos;t the most li@@ ke@@ ly sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
It &apos;s not that our mach@@ ines will become spon@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously m@@ al@@ ev@@ ol@@ ent .
J@@ ust think about how we re@@ l@@ ate to an@@ ts .
We don &apos;t h@@ ate them .
"Now , I su@@ spe@@ ct this seems far@@ -@@ fe@@ t@@ ched to many of you ."
And there are only three of them .
In@@ t@@ el@@ lig@@ ence is a matter of information proc@@ ess@@ ing in phy@@ sical syste@@ ms .
The second as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion is that we will keep going .
We will continu@@ e to impro@@ ve our intellig@@ ent mach@@ ines .
We want to c@@ ure dise@@ as@@ es like A@@ l@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s and c@@ anc@@ er .
We want to understand economic syste@@ ms . We want to impro@@ ve our c@@ lim@@ ate science .
"So we will do this , if we can ."
"Now , just con@@ si@@ der the s@@ mar@@ test person who has ever li@@ ved ."
O@@ n almost everyone &apos;s sh@@ ort@@ li@@ st here is Jo@@ h@@ n v@@ on Ne@@ um@@ an@@ n .
Here we have Jo@@ h@@ n v@@ on Ne@@ um@@ an@@ n .
And then we have you and me .
And it &apos;s important to recogn@@ ize that this is true by vir@@ tu@@ e of spe@@ ed al@@ one .
So we &apos;re talking about the end of human dru@@ d@@ g@@ ery .
We &apos;re also talking about the end of most intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ al work .
So what would ap@@ es like our@@ selves do in this circ@@ um@@ st@@ ance ?
"Well , we &apos;d be f@@ ree to pl@@ ay F@@ ri@@ s@@ be@@ e and give each other ma@@ s@@ sa@@ g@@ es ."
This is a w@@ in@@ ner@@ -@@ ta@@ ke@@ -@@ all sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
"And if you ha@@ ven &apos;t no@@ tic@@ ed , 50 years is not what it used to be ."
This is how long we &apos;ve had the i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
This is how long &quot; &quot; The S@@ imp@@ s@@ ons &quot; &quot; has been on t@@ el@@ evi@@ sion .
G@@ et ready . &quot; &quot; And now we &apos;re just coun@@ ting down the months until the mo@@ ther@@ ship l@@ ands ?
We would feel a little more ur@@ g@@ enc@@ y than we do .
"&quot; O@@ h , you &apos;re feel@@ ing de@@ press@@ ed ? J@@ ust s@@ ha@@ ke it off ; it &apos;s all in your head . &quot;"
"Now , ad@@ ul@@ ts get tri@@ c@@ ked this way as well , all the time ."
"You see , that &apos;s why so many people fun@@ c@@ tion be@@ low their ac@@ tu@@ al p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al ."
Why ? Because of poor e@@ mo@@ tional hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e .
T@@ o r@@ um@@ in@@ ate means to ch@@ ew over .
He had vi@@ sible tu@@ mor@@ s all over his body .
And he had to start a har@@ sh course of che@@ mo@@ ther@@ ap@@ y .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
I want to make a case .
He cre@@ ated this experiment that is used in many other experi@@ ments in behavi@@ or@@ al science .
I bring you into a room .
"He ga@@ ther@@ ed his par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ an@@ ts and said : &quot; I &apos;m going to time you , how quic@@ kly you can sol@@ ve this problem . &quot;"
In@@ c@@ enti@@ vi@@ ze them .
It d@@ ul@@ ls thinking and b@@ loc@@ ks cre@@ ati@@ vity .
"And I &apos;m t@@ elling you , it &apos;s not even cl@@ ose ."
"@@ Re@@ wards , by their very nature , n@@ ar@@ row our fo@@ c@@ us , con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate the mind ; that &apos;s why they work in so many ca@@ ses ."
Let me tell you why this is so important .
"I &apos;m not t@@ elling a story , I &apos;m making a case ."
Do you know who spon@@ so@@ red this resear@@ ch ?
The good news is that the scienti@@ sts who &apos;ve been stud@@ ying mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation have gi@@ ven us this new appro@@ ach .
A@@ u@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ y : the ur@@ ge to di@@ re@@ ct our own lives .
Ma@@ st@@ ery : the desi@@ re to get better and better at something that mat@@ ters .
I want to talk today only about au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ y .
"In the 20@@ th century , we came up with this idea of man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment ."
M@@ an@@ a@@ ge@@ ment did not e@@ man@@ ate from nature .
S@@ ome@@ body inv@@ en@@ ted it .
"But if you want en@@ ga@@ ge@@ ment , self-@@ direc@@ tion works better ."
How many of you have heard of the comp@@ any A@@ t@@ la@@ s@@ si@@ an ?
And they do something incredi@@ b@@ ly c@@ ool .
"A@@ u@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ y , ma@@ st@@ ery and pur@@ p@@ ose , the buil@@ ding b@@ loc@@ ks of a new way of doing things ."
"A few years later , another enc@@ y@@ c@@ lo@@ pe@@ di@@ a got started ."
The dri@@ ve to do things cause they matter .
And here &apos;s the best part .
We already know this .
Jo@@ e K@@ ow@@ an : I have st@@ age f@@ right .
"I &apos;ve always had st@@ age f@@ right , and not just a little bit , it &apos;s a big bit ."
And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 2@@ 7 .
I had this ir@@ ra@@ tional fe@@ ar .
There were like 20 people there .
"But I took a de@@ ep b@@ re@@ ath , and I sign@@ ed up to pl@@ ay , and I f@@ el@@ t pretty good ."
"Now , when you experience fe@@ ar , your sy@@ mp@@ a@@ the@@ tic ner@@ v@@ ous system k@@ ic@@ ks in ."
"I mean , your ner@@ v@@ ous system is an i@@ di@@ o@@ t ."
And something good did happen — I had the t@@ ini@@ est little g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of that au@@ di@@ ence connec@@ tion that I was hop@@ ing for .
And I wanted more . But I knew I had to get past this ner@@ v@@ ous@@ ness .
"That only seems au@@ th@@ enti@@ c when I have st@@ age f@@ right , and the more ner@@ v@@ ous I was , the better the s@@ ong would be . E@@ asy ."
"B@@ y having a s@@ ong that expla@@ ined what was happening to me , while it was happening , that gave the au@@ di@@ ence per@@ mis@@ sion to think about it ."
"And even@@ tually , over time , I didn &apos;t have to pl@@ ay the st@@ age f@@ right s@@ ong at all ."
"E@@ x@@ cept for when I was really ner@@ v@@ ous , like now . ( Laughter ) W@@ ould it be o@@ kay if I play@@ ed the st@@ age f@@ right s@@ ong for you ?"
( Applause ) C@@ an I have a si@@ p of water ?
"I@@ mag@@ ine , if you will — a gi@@ ft ."
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
It &apos;s not too big — about the si@@ ze of a golf b@@ all .
So en@@ vi@@ sion what it looks like all wr@@ app@@ ed up .
"But before I show you what &apos;s inside , I will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredi@@ ble things for you ."
It will bring all of your family together .
You will feel lo@@ ved and app@@ re@@ ci@@ ated like never before and re@@ con@@ ne@@ ct with fri@@ ends and ac@@ qu@@ a@@ int@@ anc@@ es you ha@@ ven &apos;t heard from in years .
A@@ d@@ or@@ ation and ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ tion will o@@ ver@@ wh@@ el@@ m you .
It will rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate what &apos;s most important in your life .
It will re@@ de@@ f@@ ine your sense of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ ality and fa@@ it@@ h .
You &apos;ll have a new underst@@ anding and trust in your body .
You &apos;ll have un@@ sur@@ pas@@ sed vit@@ ality and energy .
"You &apos;ll exp@@ and your vo@@ ca@@ b@@ ul@@ ary , me@@ et new people , and you &apos;ll have a heal@@ th@@ i@@ er li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le ."
And get this — you &apos;ll have an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ wee@@ k va@@ cation of doing ab@@ solu@@ tely nothing .
You &apos;ll e@@ at coun@@ t@@ less g@@ our@@ me@@ t me@@ als .
F@@ lo@@ w@@ ers will ar@@ ri@@ ve by the tr@@ uc@@ k@@ lo@@ ad .
"@@ Pe@@ ople will say to you , &quot; You look great . H@@ a@@ ve you had any work done ? &quot;"
And you &apos;ll have a li@@ fe@@ time supp@@ ly of good dru@@ gs .
"You &apos;ll be chall@@ eng@@ ed , in@@ sp@@ i@@ red , mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated and hum@@ b@@ led ."
Y@@ our life will have new me@@ an@@ ing .
"@@ Pe@@ ace , health , ser@@ en@@ ity , happiness , n@@ ir@@ v@@ an@@ a ."
The pri@@ ce ?
"@@ $ 5@@ 5@@ ,000 , and that &apos;s an incredi@@ ble de@@ al ."
B@@ y now I know you &apos;re d@@ ying to know what it is and where you can get one .
D@@ o@@ es A@@ ma@@ z@@ on car@@ ry it ?
D@@ o@@ es it have the App@@ le lo@@ go on it ?
I@@ s there a wa@@ iting li@@ st ?
No@@ t li@@ ke@@ ly .
This gi@@ ft came to me about five months ago .
It looked more like this when it was all wr@@ app@@ ed up — not quite so pretty .
"And this , and then this ."
"It was a r@@ are ge@@ m — a brain tu@@ m@@ or , he@@ man@@ gi@@ ob@@ la@@ st@@ om@@ a — the gi@@ ft that ke@@ e@@ ps on giving ."
"And while I &apos;m o@@ kay now , I wouldn &apos;t w@@ ish this gi@@ ft for you ."
I &apos;m not s@@ ure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
It prof@@ oun@@ dly al@@ ter@@ ed my life in ways I didn &apos;t expe@@ ct in all the ways I just sh@@ ar@@ ed with you .
"So the next time you &apos;re fac@@ ed with something that &apos;s u@@ nex@@ pe@@ c@@ ted , un@@ wanted and un@@ certain , con@@ si@@ der that it just may be a gi@@ ft ."
( Applause )
( Laughter ) I was af@@ ra@@ id of wom@@ an@@ h@@ ood .
"@@ No@@ t that I &apos;m not af@@ ra@@ id now , but I &apos;ve learned to pre@@ t@@ end ."
I &apos;ve learned to be f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble .
"In fact , I &apos;ve developed some interesting to@@ ols to help me de@@ al with this fe@@ ar ."
Let me explain .
"B@@ ack in the &apos; 5@@ 0s and &apos; 6@@ 0s , when I was gro@@ wing up , little girls were supp@@ osed to be kind and th@@ ou@@ ght@@ ful and pretty and g@@ ent@@ le and so@@ ft , and we were supp@@ osed to f@@ it into ro@@ les that were sort of s@@ ha@@ do@@ w@@ y — really not quite c@@ lear what we were supp@@ osed to be ."
( Laughter ) There were pl@@ ent@@ y of ro@@ le mo@@ d@@ el@@ s all around us .
"We had our mo@@ thers , our a@@ un@@ ts , our cou@@ s@@ ins , our sist@@ ers , and of course , the e@@ ver@@ -@@ pres@@ ent medi@@ a bomb@@ ar@@ ding us with imag@@ es and words , t@@ elling us how to be ."
Now my mother was different .
"She was a h@@ ome@@ ma@@ ker , but she and I didn &apos;t go out and do gir@@ li@@ e things together , and she didn &apos;t buy me p@@ ink out@@ f@@ its ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , she knew what I needed , and she b@@ ought me a book of car@@ to@@ ons ."
And I just ate it up .
"I dre@@ w , and I dre@@ w , and since I knew that hum@@ or was ac@@ cep@@ table in my family , I could d@@ ra@@ w , do what I wanted to do , and not have to per@@ form , not have to spea@@ k — I was very sh@@ y — and I could still get appro@@ val ."
I was la@@ un@@ ched as a car@@ to@@ on@@ ist .
"Now when we &apos;re young , we don &apos;t always know . We know there are r@@ ul@@ es out there , but we don &apos;t always know — we don &apos;t per@@ form them right , even though we are imp@@ r@@ in@@ ted at b@@ ir@@ th with these things , and we &apos;re told what the most important col@@ or in the world is ."
We &apos;re told what shape we &apos;re supp@@ osed to be in .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re told what to we@@ ar — ( Laughter ) — and how to do our ha@@ ir — ( Laughter ) — and how to be@@ have .
Now the r@@ ul@@ es that I &apos;m talking about are con@@ st@@ an@@ tly being mon@@ it@@ o@@ red by the culture .
"We &apos;re being cor@@ rec@@ ted , and the pri@@ mar@@ y poli@@ ce@@ men are women , because we are the car@@ ri@@ ers of the tra@@ dition ."
We pas@@ s it down from gener@@ ation to gener@@ ation .
No@@ t only that — we always have this v@@ ag@@ u@@ e no@@ tion that something &apos;s expe@@ c@@ ted of us .
"And on top of all off these r@@ ul@@ es , they keep chang@@ ing ."
"( Laughter ) We don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on half the time , so it pu@@ ts us in a very ten@@ u@@ ous position . ( Laughter )"
"Now if you don &apos;t like these r@@ ul@@ es , and many of us don &apos;t — I know I didn &apos;t , and I still don &apos;t , even though I fol@@ low them half the time , not quite a@@ w@@ are that I &apos;m fol@@ lo@@ wing them — what better way than to change them &#91; than &#93; with hum@@ or ?"
H@@ um@@ or re@@ lies on the tra@@ di@@ tions of a society .
"It ta@@ kes what we know , and it tw@@ ist@@ s it ."
"It ta@@ kes the co@@ des of behavi@@ or and the co@@ des of dre@@ ss , and it makes it u@@ nex@@ pe@@ c@@ ted , and that &apos;s what e@@ li@@ c@@ its a la@@ u@@ gh ."
Now what if you put together women and hum@@ or ?
I think you can get change .
"Because women are on the ground f@@ lo@@ or , and we know the tra@@ di@@ tions so well , we can bring a different vo@@ ice to the table ."
Now I started d@@ ra@@ wing in the mi@@ ddle of a lot of c@@ ha@@ os .
I gre@@ w up not far from here in W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ .
"@@ d@@ uring the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ i@@ ghts move@@ ment , the as@@ s@@ as@@ sin@@ ations , the W@@ at@@ er@@ g@@ ate hear@@ ings and then the fe@@ min@@ ist move@@ ment , and I think I was d@@ ra@@ wing , trying to fig@@ ure out what was going on ."
"And then also my family was in c@@ ha@@ os , and I dre@@ w to try to bring my family together — ( Laughter ) — try to bring my family together with la@@ u@@ ghter ."
It didn &apos;t work .
"M@@ y par@@ ents got di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed , and my sist@@ er was ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed ."
But I found my place .
"I found that I didn &apos;t have to we@@ ar high he@@ el@@ s , I didn &apos;t have to we@@ ar p@@ ink , and I could feel like I f@@ it in ."
"Now when I was a little ol@@ der , in my 20@@ s , I re@@ alized there are not many women in car@@ to@@ on@@ ing ."
"And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe I can brea@@ k the little g@@ la@@ ss ce@@ il@@ ing of car@@ to@@ on@@ ing , &quot; &quot; and so I did . I be@@ came a car@@ to@@ on@@ ist ."
"And then I thought — in my 4@@ 0s I started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t I do something ?"
"I always lo@@ ved poli@@ tical car@@ to@@ ons , so why don &apos;t I do something with the cont@@ ent of my car@@ to@@ ons to make people think about the stu@@ p@@ id r@@ ul@@ es that we &apos;re fol@@ lo@@ wing as well as la@@ u@@ gh ? &quot; &quot; Now my per@@ spec@@ tive is a partic@@ ul@@ arly — ( Laughter ) — my per@@ spec@@ tive is a partic@@ ul@@ arly American per@@ spec@@ tive ."
I can &apos;t help it . I live here .
"E@@ ven though I &apos;ve tra@@ vel@@ ed a lot , I still think like an American woman ."
"But I believe that the r@@ ul@@ es that I &apos;m talking about are univers@@ al , of course — that each culture has its different co@@ des of behavi@@ or and dre@@ ss and tra@@ di@@ tions , and each woman has to de@@ al with these same things that we do here in the U.S@@ ."
"C@@ on@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , we have ."
"@@ W@@ om@@ en , because we &apos;re on the ground , we know the tra@@ dition ."
We have a@@ ma@@ zing an@@ ten@@ na@@ e .
"Now my work l@@ ately has been to col@@ l@@ ab@@ or@@ ate with inter@@ national car@@ to@@ on@@ ist@@ s , which I so en@@ jo@@ y , and it &apos;s gi@@ ven me a gre@@ ater app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation for the power of car@@ to@@ ons to get at the tru@@ th , to get at the is@@ su@@ es quic@@ kly and succ@@ in@@ c@@ tly ."
"And not only that , it can get to the vie@@ wer through not only the intel@@ le@@ ct , but through the heart ."
"M@@ y work also has allowed me to col@@ l@@ ab@@ or@@ ate with women car@@ to@@ on@@ ist@@ s from across the world — countries such as S@@ au@@ d@@ i Ar@@ ab@@ ia , I@@ r@@ an , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey , Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ in@@ a , F@@ r@@ ance — and we have s@@ at together and la@@ u@@ gh@@ ed and tal@@ ked and sh@@ ar@@ ed our diffic@@ ul@@ ties ."
And these women are wor@@ king so hard to get their vo@@ ic@@ es heard in some very difficult circ@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es .
But I feel b@@ le@@ ss@@ ed to be able to work with them .
"And we talk about how women have such strong per@@ cep@@ tions , because of our ten@@ u@@ ous position and our ro@@ le as tra@@ di@@ tion@@ -@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s , that we can have the great p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al to be chan@@ ge@@ -@@ ag@@ ents ."
"And I think , I tru@@ ly believe , that we can change this thing one la@@ u@@ gh at a time ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Applause ) ( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( Applause )
But what we &apos;re going to talk about in this is how we &apos;re going to the next level .
"We st@@ um@@ b@@ led on your vi@@ de@@ o on deci@@ m@@ als , and it got through ."
The ones I started were much more pri@@ mi@@ tive .
And the K@@ ha@@ n A@@ ca@@ de@@ my vi@@ de@@ os are there .
G@@ re@@ en means the stud@@ ent &apos;s already prof@@ ici@@ ent .
T@@ ell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
( Applause )
What are the mes@@ sa@@ g@@ es we tell the women that work with and for us ?
"I left S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , where I live , on M@@ on@@ day , and I was getting on the plan@@ e for this con@@ fer@@ ence ."
The three of us take this cla@@ ss together .
W@@ om@@ en do not ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate for the@@ m@@ selves in the wor@@ k@@ force .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously . Why are you even asking ? &quot; &quot; I@@ f you ask women why they did a good job , what they &apos;ll say is someone hel@@ p@@ ed them , they got l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , they worked really hard ."
"B@@ o@@ y , it mat@@ ters a lot ."
But it &apos;s not that simple .
"And he gave the case out , both of them , to two groups of students ."
But that one word made a really big difference .
The bad news was that everyone li@@ ked H@@ o@@ ward .
This is the comp@@ li@@ cation .
The data sho@@ ws this very c@@ lear@@ ly .
P@@ hy@@ l@@ l@@ is R@@ o@@ dri@@ gu@@ e@@ z : We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people con@@ si@@ der an un@@ u@@ su@@ al fri@@ end@@ ship .
And it is .
"And yet , it feel@@ s natural to us now ."
"I first learned that my son had been in the World T@@ ra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter on the mor@@ ning of S@@ e@@ p@@ te@@ m@@ ber 1@@ 1@@ th , 200@@ 1 ."
We didn &apos;t know if he had peri@@ shed yet until 3@@ 6 h@@ ours later .
"A@@ t the time , we knew that it was poli@@ tical ."
"We were af@@ ra@@ id of what our country was going to do in the na@@ me of our son — my h@@ us@@ b@@ and , O@@ r@@ lan@@ do , and I and our family ."
"And when I saw it — and yet , through the sho@@ ck , the ter@@ ri@@ ble sho@@ ck , and the ter@@ ri@@ ble expl@@ os@@ i@@ on in our lives , liter@@ ally , we were not v@@ en@@ ge@@ ful ."
"And a couple of wee@@ ks later when Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as M@@ ous@@ sa@@ ou@@ i was in@@ dic@@ ted on six coun@@ ts of con@@ sp@@ ir@@ acy to comm@@ it ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , and the U.S@@ . govern@@ ment called for a de@@ ath p@@ en@@ al@@ ty for him , if con@@ vic@@ ted , my h@@ us@@ b@@ and and I sp@@ o@@ ke out in op@@ position to that , publi@@ c@@ ly ."
"Th@@ r@@ ough that and through human ri@@ ghts groups , we were br@@ ought together with se@@ ver@@ al other victi@@ ms &apos; fami@@ lies ."
"When I saw A@@ i@@ ch@@ a in the medi@@ a , coming over when her son was in@@ dic@@ ted , and I thought , &quot; &quot; What a bra@@ ve woman ."
S@@ ome@@ day I want to me@@ et that woman when I &apos;m stron@@ ger . &quot; &quot; I was still in de@@ ep g@@ ri@@ e@@ f ; I knew I didn &apos;t have the str@@ eng@@ th .
"I knew I would find her some@@ day , or we would find each other ."
"Because , when people heard that my son was a victi@@ m , I got im@@ medi@@ ate sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thy ."
"But when people learned what her son was acc@@ used of , she didn &apos;t get that sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thy ."
But her suff@@ ering is equ@@ al to m@@ ine .
"So we me@@ t in No@@ ve@@ m@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and A@@ i@@ ch@@ a will now tell you how that came about ."
"( T@@ r@@ ans@@ l@@ at@@ or ) A@@ i@@ ch@@ a el@@ -@@ W@@ af@@ i : G@@ ood af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , la@@ di@@ es and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men ."
I am the mother of Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as M@@ ous@@ sa@@ ou@@ i .
And I asked the O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation of H@@ um@@ an R@@ i@@ ghts to put me in tou@@ ch with the par@@ ents of the victi@@ ms .
So they int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed me to five fami@@ lies .
"And I saw P@@ hy@@ l@@ l@@ is , and I wat@@ ched her ."
She was the only mother in the group .
"The others were bro@@ thers , sist@@ ers ."
"And I saw in her ey@@ es that she was a mother , just like me ."
I suff@@ er@@ ed a lot as a mother .
I was marri@@ ed when I was 14 .
"I l@@ ost a child when I was 15 , a second child when I was 1@@ 6 ."
So the story with Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as was too much really .
"And I still suff@@ er , because my son is like he &apos;s bu@@ ri@@ ed ali@@ ve ."
I know she really cri@@ ed for her son .
But she kno@@ ws where he is .
"M@@ y son , I don &apos;t know where he is ."
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s ali@@ ve . I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s t@@ or@@ tu@@ red .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
"So that &apos;s why I decided to tell my story , so that my suff@@ ering is something pos@@ itive for other women ."
"For all the women , all the mo@@ thers that give life , you can give back , you can change ."
"It &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children ."
We must be h@@ and@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ hand and do something together .
"It &apos;s not against women , it &apos;s for us , for us women , for our children ."
"I talk against violence , against ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism ."
"I go to scho@@ ols to talk to young , M@@ us@@ li@@ m girls so they don &apos;t ac@@ cept to be marri@@ ed against their will very young ."
"So if I can sa@@ ve one of the young girls , and a@@ vo@@ id that they get marri@@ ed and suff@@ er as much as I did , well this is something good ."
This is why I &apos;m here in fron@@ t of you .
"@@ P@@ R : I would like to say that I have learned so much from A@@ i@@ ch@@ a , star@@ ting with that day we had our very first me@@ e@@ ting with other family mem@@ bers — which was a very pri@@ v@@ ate me@@ e@@ ting with se@@ cur@@ ity , because it was No@@ ve@@ m@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and , f@@ ran@@ kly , we were af@@ ra@@ id of the super@@ -@@ pat@@ ri@@ o@@ tis@@ m of that time in the country — those of us family mem@@ bers ."
But we were all so ner@@ v@@ ous .
&quot; Why does she want to me@@ et us ? &quot;
And then she was ner@@ v@@ ous .
&quot; Why did we want to me@@ et her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
"@@ Be@@ fore we knew each others &apos; n@@ am@@ es , or anything , we had em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed and we@@ p@@ t ."
"Th@@ en we s@@ at in a circ@@ le with supp@@ ort , with help , from people experienc@@ ed in this kind of re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ."
"And A@@ i@@ ch@@ a started , and she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if my son is gu@@ il@@ ty or in@@ no@@ cent , but I want to tell you how s@@ or@@ ry I am for what happened to your fami@@ lies ."
"I know what it is to suff@@ er , and I feel that if there is a cri@@ me , a person should be tried fa@@ ir@@ ly and p@@ uni@@ shed . &quot; &quot; But she re@@ ach@@ ed out to us in that way , and it was , I &apos;d like to say , it was an ic@@ e-@@ brea@@ ker ."
"And what happened then is we all told our stories , and we all connec@@ ted as human be@@ ings ."
B@@ y the end of the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on — it was about three h@@ ours after l@@ un@@ ch — we &apos;d f@@ el@@ t as if we &apos;d known each other fore@@ ver .
"Now what I learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so gener@@ ous under these pres@@ ent circ@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had ."
"I never had me@@ t someone with such a hard life , from such a t@@ ot@@ ally different culture and environ@@ ment from my own ."
"And I feel that we have a spe@@ cial connec@@ tion , which I valu@@ e very much ."
"And I think it &apos;s all about being af@@ ra@@ id of the other , but making that ste@@ p and then re@@ aliz@@ ing , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , this was@@ n &apos;t so hard ."
"Wh@@ o else can I me@@ et that I don &apos;t know , or that I &apos;m so different from ? &quot; &quot; So , A@@ i@@ ch@@ a , do you have a couple of words for con@@ clu@@ sion ?"
Because our time is up .
"( Laughter ) ( T@@ r@@ ans@@ l@@ at@@ or ) A@@ W : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other ."
"You have to be gener@@ ous , and your hear@@ ts must be gener@@ ous , your mind must be gener@@ ous ."
You must be t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant .
You have to fi@@ ght against violence .

"So , I was in the h@@ os@@ p@@ ital for a long time ."
"And a few years after I left , I went back , and the c@@ ha@@ ir@@ man of the bur@@ n de@@ par@@ t@@ ment was very exc@@ ited to see me — said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , I have a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic new tre@@ at@@ ment for you . &quot; &quot; I was very exc@@ ited . I wal@@ ked with him to his off@@ ice ."
"And he expla@@ ined to me that , when I s@@ have , I have little black d@@ ots on the left side of my face where the ha@@ ir is , but on the right side of my face I was b@@ ad@@ ly bur@@ ned so I have no ha@@ ir , and this cre@@ ates l@@ ack of sy@@ m@@ me@@ try ."
And what &apos;s the bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant idea he had ?
He was going to t@@ at@@ too little black d@@ ots on the right side of my face and make me look very sy@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c .
It s@@ oun@@ ded interesting . He asked me to go and s@@ have .
"@@ Let me tell you , this was a stran@@ ge way to s@@ have , because I thought about it and I re@@ alized that the way I was s@@ having then would be the way I would s@@ have for the rest of my life — because I had to keep the wi@@ d@@ th the same ."
"When I got back to his off@@ ice , I was@@ n &apos;t really s@@ ure ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I see some evi@@ dence for this ? &quot; &quot; So he showed me some pic@@ tures of little che@@ e@@ ks with little black d@@ ots — not very in@@ forma@@ tive ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; What happens when I grow ol@@ der and my ha@@ ir be@@ comes wh@@ ite ?"
"What would happen then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , don &apos;t wor@@ ry about it , &quot; &quot; he said ."
&quot; We have la@@ s@@ ers ; we can wh@@ it@@ en it out . &quot;
"But I was still con@@ cer@@ ned , so I said , &quot; &quot; You know what , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; And then came one of the big@@ gest gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ ps of my life ."
"This is coming from a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish guy , all right , so that means a lot ."
"( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , what &apos;s wrong with you ?"
Do you en@@ jo@@ y looking n@@ on@@ -@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c ?
Do you have some kind of per@@ ver@@ ted ple@@ as@@ ure from this ?
Do women feel p@@ ity for you and have sex with you more fre@@ qu@@ ently ? &quot; &quot; N@@ one of those happened .
"And this was very surpri@@ sing to me , because I &apos;ve g@@ one through many tre@@ at@@ ments — there were many tre@@ at@@ ments I decided not to do — and I never got this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p to this ex@@ t@@ ent ."
But I decided not to have this tre@@ at@@ ment .
"And I went to his de@@ pu@@ ty and asked him , &quot; &quot; What was going on ?"
"Wh@@ ere was this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p coming from ? &quot; &quot; And he expla@@ ined that they have done this proc@@ ed@@ ure on two patients already , and they need the th@@ ir@@ d pati@@ ent for a p@@ ap@@ er they were wr@@ iting ."
( Laughter ) Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a sch@@ m@@ uc@@ k .
"@@ R@@ ight , that &apos;s what he seems like ."
But let me give you a different per@@ spec@@ tive on the same story .
"A few years ago , I was run@@ ning some of my own experi@@ ments in the la@@ b ."
"And when we ru@@ n experi@@ ments , we u@@ su@@ ally hop@@ e that one group will be@@ have differ@@ ently than another ."
"So we had one group that I hop@@ ed their per@@ form@@ ance would be very high , another group that I thought their per@@ form@@ ance would be very low , and when I got the results , that &apos;s what we got — I was very happy — a@@ side from one person ."
There was one person in the group that was supp@@ osed to have very high per@@ form@@ ance that was actually per@@ form@@ ing ter@@ ri@@ b@@ ly .
"And he pul@@ led the whole mean down , de@@ stro@@ ying my st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cal sign@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance of the test ."
So I looked car@@ e@@ fully at this guy .
He was 20@@ -@@ some years ol@@ der than any@@ body else in the sa@@ mple .
And I remem@@ ber@@ ed that the old and dr@@ un@@ ken guy came one day to the la@@ b wan@@ ting to make some easy ca@@ sh and this was the guy .
&quot; &quot; F@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic ! &quot; &quot; I thought . &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s th@@ row him out .
"Wh@@ o would ever in@@ clu@@ de a dr@@ un@@ ken guy in a sa@@ mple ? &quot; &quot; But a couple of da@@ ys later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; &quot; What would have happened if this dr@@ un@@ ken guy was not in that con@@ dition ?"
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
"@@ W@@ ould we have th@@ ro@@ wn him out then ? &quot; &quot; We probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; &quot; F@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic ! What a s@@ mar@@ t guy who is per@@ form@@ ing this low , &quot; &quot; because he would have pul@@ led the mean of the group lo@@ wer , giving us even stron@@ ger st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cal results than we could ."
So we decided not to th@@ row the guy out and to r@@ er@@ u@@ n the experiment .
"But you know , these stories , and lots of other experi@@ ments that we &apos;ve done on con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ ts of inter@@ est , ba@@ sically kind of bring two poin@@ ts to the fore@@ ground for me ."
"The first one is that in life we en@@ coun@@ ter many people who , in some way or another , try to t@@ at@@ too our fac@@ es ."
They just have the in@@ c@@ enti@@ ves that get them to be bl@@ in@@ ded to reality and give us adv@@ ice that is in@@ her@@ ently bi@@ as@@ ed .
"And I &apos;m s@@ ure that it &apos;s something that we all recogn@@ ize , and we see that it happens ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe we don &apos;t recogn@@ ize it every time , but we understand that it happens ."
"The most difficult thing , of course , is to recogn@@ ize that some@@ times we too are bl@@ in@@ ded by our own in@@ c@@ enti@@ ves ."
"And that &apos;s a much , much more difficult le@@ s@@ son to take into ac@@ coun@@ t ."
Because we don &apos;t see how con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ ts of inter@@ est work on us .
"When I was doing these experi@@ ments , in my mind , I was hel@@ p@@ ing science ."
I was e@@ li@@ min@@ ating the data to get the true patter@@ n of the data to sh@@ ine through .
I was@@ n &apos;t doing something bad .
"In my mind , I was actually a k@@ ni@@ ght trying to help science move along ."
But this was not the case .
I was actually inter@@ f@@ ering with the process with lots of good int@@ en@@ tions .
"And I think the real chall@@ en@@ ge is to fig@@ ure out where are the ca@@ ses in our lives where con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ ts of inter@@ est work on us , and try not to trust our own in@@ tu@@ ition to o@@ ver@@ come it , but to try to do things that pre@@ v@@ ent us from f@@ all@@ ing pre@@ y to these behavi@@ ors , because we can create lots of un@@ desi@@ r@@ able circ@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es ."
I do want to lea@@ ve you with one pos@@ itive thought .
"I mean , this is all very de@@ press@@ ing , right — people have con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ ts of inter@@ est , we don &apos;t see it , and so on ."
"The pos@@ itive per@@ spec@@ tive , I think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the de@@ ep me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms of why we fa@@ il and where we fa@@ il , we can actually hop@@ e to fi@@ x things ."
"And that , I think , is the hop@@ e . Thank you very much ."
( Applause )
You all know the tru@@ th of what I &apos;m going to say .
I think the in@@ tu@@ ition that inequ@@ ality is divi@@ sive and soci@@ ally cor@@ ros@@ i@@ ve has been around since before the F@@ r@@ en@@ ch R@@ evolution .
"What &apos;s chang@@ ed is we now can look at the evi@@ dence , we can comp@@ are societies , more and less equ@@ al societies , and see what inequ@@ ality does ."
I &apos;m going to take you through that data and then explain why the l@@ in@@ ks I &apos;m going to be sho@@ wing you ex@@ ist .
"But first , see what a mi@@ ser@@ able lot we are ."
( Laughter ) I want to start though with a par@@ a@@ do@@ x .
This sho@@ ws you life expe@@ c@@ t@@ anc@@ y against gr@@ os@@ s national income — how rich countries are on average .
"And you see the countries on the right , like N@@ or@@ way and the U@@ S@@ A , are tw@@ ice as rich as I@@ s@@ ra@@ el , G@@ re@@ ece , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al on the left ."
And it makes no difference to their life expe@@ c@@ t@@ anc@@ y at all .
There &apos;s no sug@@ g@@ es@@ tion of a relation@@ ship there .
"But if we look within our societies , there are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary social gra@@ di@@ ents in health run@@ ning right across society ."
"This , again , is life expe@@ c@@ t@@ anc@@ y ."
"Th@@ ese are small are@@ as of Eng@@ land and W@@ al@@ es — the p@@ oo@@ rest on the right , the ri@@ ch@@ est on the left ."
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .
E@@ ven the people just be@@ low the top have less good health than the people at the top .
"So income means something very important within our societies , and nothing between them ."
"The ex@@ plan@@ ation of that par@@ a@@ do@@ x is that , within our societies , we &apos;re looking at rela@@ tive income or social position , social st@@ at@@ us — where we are in rela@@ tion to each other and the si@@ ze of the g@@ aps between us ."
"And as so@@ on as you &apos;ve got that idea , you should im@@ medi@@ ately won@@ der : what happens if we wi@@ d@@ en the differ@@ ences , or com@@ pre@@ ss them , make the income differ@@ ences big@@ ger or sm@@ all@@ er ?"
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m not using any hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical data .
I &apos;m ta@@ king data from the U.@@ N@@ . — it &apos;s the same as the World B@@ ank has — on the sc@@ ale of income differ@@ ences in these rich developed mark@@ et democ@@ r@@ ac@@ ies .
"The measure we &apos;ve used , because it &apos;s easy to understand and you can do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad it , is how much ri@@ ch@@ er the top 20 percent than the bot@@ tom 20 percent in each country ."
"And you see in the more equ@@ al countries on the left — Japan , F@@ in@@ land , N@@ or@@ way , S@@ wed@@ en — the top 20 percent are about three and a half , four times as rich as the bot@@ tom 20 percent ."
"But on the more u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al end — U.@@ K@@ . , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al , U@@ S@@ A , S@@ ing@@ ap@@ ore — the differ@@ ences are tw@@ ice as big ."
"O@@ n that measure , we are tw@@ ice as u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al as some of the other success@@ ful mark@@ et democ@@ r@@ ac@@ ies ."
Now I &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
"We col@@ lec@@ ted data on problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents , the kind of problems that are more common at the bot@@ tom of the social la@@ d@@ der ."
"I@@ n@@ ter@@ nati@@ on@@ ally com@@ par@@ able data on life expe@@ c@@ t@@ anc@@ y , on kids &apos; ma@@ ths and liter@@ acy s@@ co@@ res , on in@@ f@@ ant mor@@ tal@@ ity r@@ ates , h@@ om@@ ici@@ de r@@ ates , pro@@ p@@ or@@ tion of the population in pri@@ son , te@@ en@@ age b@@ ir@@ thr@@ ates , le@@ vel@@ s of trust , o@@ be@@ s@@ ity , mental il@@ l@@ ness — which in st@@ and@@ ard di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic cla@@ s@@ si@@ fi@@ cation in@@ clu@@ des dru@@ g and al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l ad@@ dic@@ tion — and social mo@@ bi@@ lity ."
We put them all in one in@@ de@@ x .
They &apos;re all we@@ i@@ gh@@ ted equ@@ ally .
Wh@@ ere a country is is a sort of average sc@@ ore on these things .
"And there , you see it in rela@@ tion to the measure of inequ@@ ality I &apos;ve just sho@@ wn you , which I sh@@ all use over and over again in the data ."
The more u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
It &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly cl@@ ose cor@@ rela@@ tion .
"But if you look at that same in@@ de@@ x of health and social problems in rela@@ tion to G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a , gr@@ os@@ s national income , there &apos;s nothing there , no cor@@ rela@@ tion any@@ more ."
"We were a little bit wor@@ ri@@ ed that people might think we &apos;d been cho@@ os@@ ing problems to su@@ it our ar@@ g@@ ument and just man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ red this evi@@ dence , so we also did a p@@ ap@@ er in the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh M@@ e@@ di@@ cal J@@ ourn@@ al on the U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F in@@ de@@ x of child well-being ."
It has 40 different comp@@ on@@ ents put together by other people .
"It con@@ ta@@ ins whether kids can talk to their par@@ ents , whether they have b@@ oo@@ ks at home , what im@@ m@@ uni@@ z@@ ation r@@ ates are like , whether there &apos;s b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying at school ."
E@@ very@@ thing goes into it .
Here it is in rela@@ tion to that same measure of inequ@@ ality .
K@@ i@@ ds do worse in the more u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al societies .
H@@ i@@ gh@@ ly sign@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant relation@@ ship .
"But once again , if you look at that measure of child well-being , in rela@@ tion to national income per person , there &apos;s no relation@@ ship , no sug@@ g@@ es@@ tion of a relation@@ ship ."
What all the data I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you so far says is the same thing .
The average well-being of our societies is not dep@@ end@@ ent any longer on national income and economic growth .
"That &apos;s very important in p@@ oo@@ re@@ r countries , but not in the rich developed world ."
But the differ@@ ences between us and where we are in rela@@ tion to each other now matter very much .
I &apos;m going to show you some of the se@@ par@@ ate b@@ its of our in@@ de@@ x .
"@@ Here , for inst@@ ance , is trust ."
It &apos;s simply the pro@@ p@@ or@@ tion of the population who ag@@ ree most people can be tru@@ st@@ ed .
It comes from the World V@@ alu@@ es S@@ ur@@ v@@ ey .
"You see , at the more u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al end , it &apos;s about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others ."
"But in the more equ@@ al societies , it ri@@ ses to 60 or 6@@ 5 percent ."
"And if you look at meas@@ ures of inv@@ ol@@ ve@@ ment in comm@@ unity life or social cap@@ ital , very si@@ mil@@ ar relation@@ shi@@ ps cl@@ os@@ ely re@@ l@@ ated to inequ@@ ality ."
"I may say , we did all this work tw@@ ice ."
"We did it first on these rich , developed countries , and then as a se@@ par@@ ate test b@@ ed , we re@@ pe@@ ated it all on the 50 American st@@ ates — asking just the same question : do the more u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al st@@ ates do worse on all these kinds of meas@@ ures ?"
So here is trust from a gener@@ al social sur@@ v@@ ey of the fe@@ der@@ al govern@@ ment re@@ l@@ ated to inequ@@ ality .
V@@ ery si@@ mil@@ ar s@@ cat@@ ter over a si@@ mil@@ ar ran@@ ge of le@@ vel@@ s of trust .
S@@ a@@ me thing is going on .
B@@ a@@ sically we found that almost anything that &apos;s re@@ l@@ ated to trust inter@@ nati@@ on@@ ally is re@@ l@@ ated to trust a@@ mon@@ g@@ st the 50 st@@ ates in that se@@ par@@ ate test b@@ ed .
We &apos;re not just talking about a flu@@ ke .
This is mental il@@ l@@ ness .
W@@ H@@ O put together fi@@ gu@@ res using the same di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic inter@@ vie@@ ws on ran@@ dom sa@@ mp@@ les of the population to all@@ ow us to comp@@ are r@@ ates of mental il@@ l@@ ness in each society .
This is the percent of the population with any mental il@@ l@@ ness in the pre@@ c@@ ed@@ ing year .
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that — whole societies with three times the level of mental il@@ l@@ ness of others .
"And again , cl@@ os@@ ely re@@ l@@ ated to inequ@@ ality ."
This is violence .
"Th@@ ese red d@@ ots are American st@@ ates , and the b@@ lu@@ e tri@@ ang@@ les are C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an pro@@ v@@ in@@ ces ."
But look at the sc@@ ale of the differ@@ ences .
It goes from 15 h@@ om@@ ici@@ des per million up to 150 .
This is the pro@@ p@@ or@@ tion of the population in pri@@ son .
"There &apos;s a about a ten@@ f@@ old difference there , lo@@ g sc@@ ale up the side ."
But it goes from about 40 to 4@@ 00 people in pri@@ son .
That relation@@ ship is not ma@@ in@@ ly dri@@ ven by more cri@@ me .
"In some pl@@ ac@@ es , that &apos;s part of it ."
"But most of it is about more p@@ uni@@ tive s@@ ent@@ enc@@ ing , har@@ sh@@ er s@@ ent@@ enc@@ ing ."
And the more u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al societies are more li@@ ke@@ ly also to re@@ tain the de@@ ath p@@ en@@ al@@ ty .
Here we have children dro@@ pp@@ ing out of high school .
"A@@ ga@@ in , quite big differ@@ ences ."
"E@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly da@@ mag@@ ing , if you &apos;re talking about using the tal@@ ents of the population ."
This is social mo@@ bi@@ lity .
It &apos;s actually a measure of mo@@ bi@@ lity based on income .
"B@@ a@@ sically , it &apos;s asking : do rich fa@@ thers have rich s@@ ons and poor fa@@ thers have poor s@@ ons , or is there no relation@@ ship between the two ?"
"And at the more u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al end , fa@@ thers &apos; income is much more important — in the U.@@ K@@ . , U@@ S@@ A ."
"And in S@@ c@@ and@@ in@@ a@@ vi@@ an countries , fa@@ thers &apos; income is much less important ."
There &apos;s more social mo@@ bi@@ lity .
"And as we like to say — and I know there are a lot of Americ@@ ans in the au@@ di@@ ence here — if Americ@@ ans want to live the American dre@@ am , they should go to D@@ en@@ mar@@ k ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you just a few things in it@@ al@@ ic@@ s here .
I could have sho@@ wn a number of other problems .
They &apos;re all problems that t@@ end to be more common at the bot@@ tom of the social gra@@ di@@ ent .
"But there are end@@ less problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents that are worse in more u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al countries — not just a little bit worse , but anything from tw@@ ice as common to 10 times as common ."
"Th@@ ink of the exp@@ en@@ se , the human cost of that ."
I want to go back though to this grap@@ h that I showed you ear@@ li@@ er where we put it all together to make two poin@@ ts .
"One is that , in grap@@ h after grap@@ h , we find the countries that do worse , wh@@ at@@ ever the out@@ come , seem to be the more u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al ones , and the ones that do well seem to be the N@@ or@@ di@@ c countries and Japan ."
So what we &apos;re looking at is gener@@ al social dis@@ fun@@ c@@ tion re@@ l@@ ated to inequ@@ ality .
"It &apos;s not just one or two things that go wrong , it &apos;s most things ."
"The other really important point I want to make on this grap@@ h is that , if you look at the bot@@ tom , S@@ wed@@ en and Japan , they &apos;re very different countries in all s@@ orts of ways ."
"The position of women , how cl@@ os@@ ely they keep to the n@@ uc@@ lear family , are on op@@ pos@@ ite ends of the p@@ ol@@ es in terms of the rich developed world ."
But another really important difference is how they get their gre@@ ater equ@@ ality .
"S@@ wed@@ en has hu@@ ge differ@@ ences in ear@@ n@@ ings , and it n@@ ar@@ ro@@ ws the ga@@ p through ta@@ x@@ ation , gener@@ al w@@ el@@ f@@ are state , gener@@ ous bene@@ f@@ its and so on ."
Japan is rather different though .
It star@@ ts off with much sm@@ all@@ er differ@@ ences in ear@@ n@@ ings before ta@@ x .
It has lo@@ wer ta@@ x@@ es .
It has a sm@@ all@@ er w@@ el@@ f@@ are state .
"And in our an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is of the American st@@ ates , we find rather the same con@@ tra@@ st ."
"There are some st@@ ates that do well through re@@ dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion , some st@@ ates that do well because they have sm@@ all@@ er income differ@@ ences before ta@@ x ."
"So we con@@ clu@@ de that it doesn &apos;t much matter how you get your gre@@ ater equ@@ ality , as long as you get there some@@ how ."
"I am not talking about per@@ fe@@ ct equ@@ ality , I &apos;m talking about what exist@@ s in rich developed mark@@ et democ@@ r@@ ac@@ ies ."
A@@ no@@ ther really surpri@@ sing part of this picture is that it &apos;s not just the poor who are a@@ ffec@@ ted by inequ@@ ality .
There seems to be some tru@@ th in Jo@@ h@@ n D@@ on@@ ne &apos;s &quot; No man is an is@@ land . &quot;
"And in a number of studies , it &apos;s possible to comp@@ are how people do in more and less equ@@ al countries at each level in the social hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y ."
This is just one example .
It &apos;s in@@ f@@ ant mor@@ tal@@ ity .
S@@ ome S@@ wed@@ es very kin@@ dly cla@@ s@@ si@@ fied a lot of their in@@ f@@ ant de@@ a@@ ths acc@@ ord@@ ing to the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh re@@ gi@@ ster of gener@@ al soci@@ o@@ economic cla@@ s@@ si@@ fi@@ cation .
"And so it &apos;s an@@ ach@@ r@@ on@@ is@@ tic@@ ally a cla@@ s@@ si@@ fi@@ cation by fa@@ thers &apos; o@@ cc@@ up@@ ations , so single par@@ ents go on their own ."
"But then where it says &quot; &quot; low social cla@@ ss , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s un@@ sk@@ il@@ led man@@ u@@ al o@@ cc@@ up@@ ations ."
"It goes through to@@ wards the sk@@ il@@ led man@@ u@@ al o@@ cc@@ up@@ ations in the mi@@ ddle , then the j@@ uni@@ or n@@ on@@ -@@ man@@ u@@ al , going up high to the profes@@ si@@ onal o@@ cc@@ up@@ ations — doc@@ tors , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , direc@@ tors of lar@@ ger comp@@ an@@ ies ."
You see there that S@@ wed@@ en does better than B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in all the way across the social hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y .
The big@@ gest differ@@ ences are at the bot@@ tom of society .
"But even at the top , there seems to be a small bene@@ f@@ it to being in a more equ@@ al society ."
We show that on about five different se@@ ts of data co@@ ver@@ ing edu@@ ca@@ tional out@@ comes and health in the United States and inter@@ nati@@ on@@ ally .
"And that seems to be the gener@@ al picture — that gre@@ ater equ@@ ality makes most difference at the bot@@ tom , but has some bene@@ f@@ its even at the top ."
But I should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
I think I &apos;m looking and talking about the psy@@ ch@@ os@@ o@@ cial effec@@ ts of inequ@@ ality .
"M@@ ore to do with feel@@ ings of su@@ peri@@ or@@ ity and in@@ f@@ eri@@ or@@ ity , of being valu@@ ed and de@@ valu@@ ed , re@@ spec@@ ted and dis@@ re@@ spec@@ ted ."
"And of course , those feel@@ ings of the st@@ at@@ us com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion that comes out of that dri@@ ves the con@@ su@@ mer@@ ism in our society ."
It also lea@@ ds to st@@ at@@ us in@@ se@@ cur@@ ity .
"We wor@@ ry more about how we &apos;re j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ed and se@@ en by others , whether we &apos;re re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded as at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive , c@@ le@@ ver , all that kind of thing ."
"The soci@@ al@@ -@@ ev@@ alu@@ ative j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments increase , the fe@@ ar of those soci@@ al@@ -@@ ev@@ alu@@ ative j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments ."
"I@@ n@@ ter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , some par@@ al@@ le@@ l work going on in social psycho@@ logy : some people re@@ vie@@ wed 20@@ 8 different studies in which v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers had been inv@@ ited into a psycho@@ logical l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory and had their stre@@ ss h@@ or@@ mon@@ es , their respon@@ ses to doing stre@@ ss@@ ful t@@ as@@ ks , meas@@ u@@ red ."
"And in the re@@ view , what they were interest@@ ed in see@@ ing is what kind of stre@@ ss@@ es most reli@@ ably ra@@ ise le@@ vel@@ s of cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , the cen@@ tr@@ al stre@@ ss h@@ orm@@ one ."
And the con@@ clu@@ sion was it was t@@ as@@ ks that in@@ clu@@ ded soci@@ al@@ -@@ ev@@ alu@@ ative thre@@ at — thre@@ at@@ s to self-@@ e@@ ste@@ e@@ m or social st@@ at@@ us in which others can ne@@ g@@ ati@@ vely j@@ u@@ dge your per@@ form@@ ance .
Th@@ ose kind of stre@@ ss@@ es have a very particular effec@@ t on the phy@@ si@@ o@@ logy of stre@@ ss .
Now we have been cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed .
"O@@ f course , there are people who dis@@ like this stuff and people who find it very surpri@@ sing ."
"I should tell you though that when people cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze us for pic@@ king and cho@@ os@@ ing data , we never pic@@ k and cho@@ ose data ."
"We have an ab@@ solu@@ te ru@@ le that if our data sour@@ ce has data for one of the countries we &apos;re looking at , it goes into the an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is ."
"O@@ ur data sour@@ ce deci@@ des whether it &apos;s reli@@ able data , we don &apos;t ."
O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se that would int@@ ro@@ duce bi@@ as .
What about other countries ?
There are 200 studies of health in rela@@ tion to income and equ@@ ality in the a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed j@@ ourn@@ als .
"This isn &apos;t con@@ fin@@ ed to these countries here , hi@@ ding a very simple de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion ."
"The same countries , the same measure of inequ@@ ality , one problem after another ."
Why don &apos;t we contro@@ l for other fac@@ tors ?
Well we &apos;ve sho@@ wn you that G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a doesn &apos;t make any difference .
"And of course , others using more s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ ca@@ ted me@@ th@@ o@@ ds in the liter@@ ature have contro@@ l@@ led for po@@ ver@@ ty and education and so on ."
What about ca@@ us@@ ality ?
C@@ or@@ rela@@ tion in itself doesn &apos;t pro@@ ve ca@@ us@@ ality .
We sp@@ end a good bit of time .
"And in@@ de@@ ed , people know the ca@@ us@@ al l@@ in@@ ks quite well in some of these out@@ comes ."
"The big change in our underst@@ anding of dri@@ ver@@ s of ch@@ r@@ on@@ ic health in the rich developed world is how important ch@@ r@@ on@@ ic stre@@ ss from social sour@@ ces is a@@ ffec@@ ting the im@@ m@@ un@@ e system , the car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ c@@ ular system ."
"O@@ r for inst@@ ance , the reason why violence be@@ comes more common in more u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al societies is because people are sen@@ si@@ tive to being looked down on ."
"I should say that to de@@ al with this , we &apos;ve got to de@@ al with the pos@@ t@@ -@@ ta@@ x things and the pre@@ -@@ ta@@ x things ."
"We &apos;ve got to con@@ stra@@ in income , the b@@ on@@ us culture in@@ comes at the top ."
I think we must make our b@@ os@@ ses ac@@ coun@@ table to their emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es in any way we can .
I think the ta@@ ke@@ -@@ home mes@@ sage though is that we can impro@@ ve the real qu@@ ality of human life by re@@ duc@@ ing the differ@@ ences in in@@ comes between us .

"E@@ v@@ olution has been a per@@ en@@ ni@@ al t@@ op@@ ic here at the TED Con@@ fer@@ ence , but I want to give you today one doc@@ tor &apos;s take on the sub@@ ject ."
"The great 20@@ th@@ -@@ century g@@ ene@@ ti@@ ci@@ st , T@@ .@@ G@@ .

"( Laughter ) But if you do ac@@ cept bio@@ logical evolution , con@@ si@@ der this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?"
"D@@ o@@ es it app@@ ly to others , or does it app@@ ly to us ?"
This is another look at the t@@ ree of life .
"In this picture , I &apos;ve put a b@@ us@@ h with a cen@@ ter br@@ an@@ ching out in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the ed@@ g@@ es of the t@@ ree of life , every exist@@ ing speci@@ es at the ti@@ ps of those br@@ an@@ ch@@ es has su@@ c@@ ce@@ eded in ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary terms : it has survi@@ ved ; it has de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated a f@@ it@@ ness to its environ@@ ment ."
"The human part of this br@@ an@@ ch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interest@@ ed in ."
We br@@ an@@ ch off of a common an@@ ce@@ st@@ or to modern ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
"In the inter@@ val , there have been perhaps 20 or 2@@ 5 different speci@@ es of h@@ om@@ ini@@ ds ."

"We have been here for about 1@@ 3@@ 0,000 years ."
"It may seem like we &apos;re quite re@@ m@@ ote from other parts of this t@@ ree of life , but actually , for the most part , the ba@@ sic mach@@ in@@ ery of our cells is pretty much the same ."
Do you re@@ aliz@@ e that we can take adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge and comm@@ an@@ de@@ er the mach@@ in@@ ery of a common bac@@ ter@@ i@@ um to pro@@ duce the pr@@ ot@@ e@@ in of human in@@ sul@@ in used to treat di@@ a@@ be@@ tics ?

"And spea@@ king of bac@@ ter@@ ia , do you re@@ aliz@@ e that each of us car@@ ri@@ es in our g@@ ut more bac@@ ter@@ ia than there are cells in the rest of our body ?"
Ma@@ ybe 10 times more .
"I mean think of it , when An@@ t@@ on@@ i@@ o D@@ a@@ ma@@ si@@ o as@@ ks about your self-@@ i@@ ma@@ ge , do you think about the bac@@ ter@@ ia ?"

But what will come in the future ?
A@@ re we at some kind of ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary equ@@ i@@ po@@ ise as a speci@@ es ?
"O@@ r , are we de@@ st@@ ined to become something different — something , perhaps , even better ad@@ ap@@ ted to the environ@@ ment ?"
"Now let &apos;s take a ste@@ p back in time to the Big Bang , 14 billion years ago — the Earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years — the first sign@@ s of pr@@ ot@@ o@@ -@@ life , maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth — the first multi@@ -@@ c@@ ell@@ ed organ@@ is@@ ms , perhaps as much as 8@@ 00 or a billion years ago — and then the human speci@@ es , fin@@ ally e@@ mer@@ g@@ ing in the last 1@@ 3@@ 0,000 years ."

I was trying to pre@@ ser@@ ve the body .
I wanted to keep us heal@@ thy .
I wanted to re@@ st@@ ore health from disease .
I wanted us to live long and heal@@ thy lives .
"E@@ v@@ olution is all about pas@@ sing on the gen@@ ome to the next gener@@ ation , ad@@ ap@@ ting and survi@@ ving through gener@@ ation after gener@@ ation ."
"F@@ rom an ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary point of view , you and I are like the bo@@ os@@ ter ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts de@@ sign@@ ed to s@@ end the g@@ ene@@ tic pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad into the next level of or@@ bit and then dro@@ p off into the se@@ a ."
"I think we would all understand the s@@ enti@@ ment that W@@ oo@@ dy A@@ l@@ l@@ en ex@@ press@@ ed when he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to achi@@ e@@ ve im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity through my work ."
I want to achi@@ e@@ ve it through not d@@ ying . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ v@@ olution does not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly fa@@ v@@ or the lon@@ ge@@ st@@ -@@ li@@ ved .
"It doesn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly fa@@ v@@ or the big@@ gest or the stron@@ gest or the fa@@ ste@@ st , and not even the s@@ mar@@ test ."
E@@ v@@ olution fa@@ v@@ ors those cre@@ atures best ad@@ ap@@ ted to their environ@@ ment .
That is the so@@ le test of survi@@ val and success .
"A@@ t the bot@@ tom of the o@@ ce@@ an , bac@@ ter@@ ia that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ c and can survi@@ ve at the ste@@ am v@@ ent he@@ at that would o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se pro@@ duce , if fi@@ sh were there , s@@ ous@@ -@@ vi@@ de c@@ oo@@ ked fi@@ sh , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , have man@@ ag@@ ed to make that a h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ able environ@@ ment for them ."
"So what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of hum@@ ans in evolution , and partic@@ ul@@ arly as we look a@@ head to the next p@@ ha@@ se , I would say that there are a number of pos@@ sibi@@ li@@ ties ."
The first is that we will not ev@@ ol@@ ve .
We have re@@ ach@@ ed a kind of equ@@ i@@ po@@ ise .
"And the reas@@ on@@ ing be@@ h@@ ind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , man@@ ag@@ ed to pre@@ ser@@ ve a lot of gen@@ es that would o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se be sel@@ ec@@ ted out and be re@@ mo@@ ved from the population ."
"And secon@@ dly , we as a speci@@ es have so con@@ fi@@ gu@@ red our environ@@ ment that we have man@@ ag@@ ed to make it ad@@ ap@@ t to us as well as we ad@@ ap@@ t to it ."
"And by the way , we im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ate and cir@@ cul@@ ate and inter@@ mi@@ x so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the i@@ so@@ la@@ tion that is nec@@ ess@@ ary for evolution to take place ."
"A second pos@@ sibi@@ lity is that there will be evolution of the tra@@ di@@ tional kind , natural , imp@@ osed by the for@@ ces of nature ."
"And the ar@@ g@@ ument here would be that the wh@@ e@@ el@@ s of evolution gr@@ ind s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able ."
"And as far as i@@ so@@ la@@ tion goes , when we as a speci@@ es do col@@ on@@ ize dist@@ ant planets , there will be the i@@ so@@ la@@ tion and the environ@@ mental changes that could pro@@ duce evolution in the natural way ."
"But there &apos;s a th@@ ir@@ d pos@@ sibi@@ lity , an en@@ tic@@ ing , in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing pos@@ sibi@@ lity ."
"I call it ne@@ o@@ -@@ evolution — the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gu@@ i@@ ded and ch@@ os@@ en by us as in@@ divi@@ du@@ als in the cho@@ ic@@ es that we will make ."
Now how could this come about ?
How could it be possible that we would do this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , first , the reality that people today , in some cul@@ tures , are making cho@@ ic@@ es about their off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing ."
"They &apos;re , in some cul@@ tures , cho@@ os@@ ing to have more m@@ al@@ es than fe@@ m@@ al@@ es ."
"It &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly good for the society , but it &apos;s what the in@@ divi@@ du@@ al and the family are cho@@ os@@ ing ."
"Th@@ ink also , if it were possible ever for you to cho@@ ose , not simply to cho@@ ose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the g@@ ene@@ tic ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ments that would c@@ ure or pre@@ v@@ ent dise@@ as@@ es ."
What if you could make the g@@ ene@@ tic changes to e@@ li@@ min@@ ate di@@ a@@ bet@@ es or A@@ l@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s or re@@ duce the ri@@ s@@ k of c@@ anc@@ er or e@@ li@@ min@@ ate stro@@ ke ?
W@@ ouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your gen@@ es ?
"If we look a@@ head , these kind of changes are going to be increas@@ ing@@ ly possible ."
"The H@@ um@@ an G@@ en@@ ome P@@ ro@@ ject started in 19@@ 9@@ 0 , and it took 1@@ 3 years ."
It cost 2@@ .@@ 7 billion dollars .
"The year after it was fin@@ i@@ shed in 200@@ 4 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months ."
"T@@ o@@ day , you can have a comple@@ te se@@ qu@@ ence of the three billion b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s in the human gen@@ ome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a wee@@ k ."
"It won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ dol@@ lar human gen@@ ome , and it will be increas@@ ing@@ ly a@@ va@@ il@@ able for everyone ."
"@@ J@@ ust a wee@@ k ago , the N@@ ati@@ onal A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of Eng@@ ine@@ ering a@@ war@@ ded its D@@ r@@ ap@@ er P@@ ri@@ ze to F@@ r@@ anc@@ is Ar@@ no@@ ld and W@@ il@@ le@@ m S@@ te@@ mm@@ er , two scienti@@ sts who in@@ dep@@ end@@ ently developed tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the natural process of evolution to work fa@@ ster and to le@@ ad to desi@@ r@@ able pr@@ ot@@ e@@ ins in a more e@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent way — what F@@ r@@ anc@@ es Ar@@ no@@ ld call@@ s &quot; &quot; direc@@ ted evolution . &quot; &quot; A couple of years ago , the L@@ as@@ ker P@@ ri@@ ze was a@@ war@@ ded to the scienti@@ st S@@ h@@ in@@ y@@ a Y@@ am@@ an@@ a@@ k@@ a for his resear@@ ch in which he took an ad@@ ult sk@@ in cell , a fi@@ bro@@ b@@ last , and by man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating just four gen@@ es , he in@@ duc@@ ed that cell to re@@ ver@@ t to a pl@@ u@@ ri@@ p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al ste@@ m cell — a cell p@@ ot@@ enti@@ ally cap@@ ab@@ le@@ "
of be@@ coming any cell in your body .
These changes are coming .
"The same technology that has produc@@ ed the human in@@ sul@@ in in bac@@ ter@@ ia can make vir@@ us@@ es that will not only pr@@ ot@@ ec@@ t you against the@@ m@@ selves , but in@@ duce im@@ m@@ unity against other vir@@ us@@ es ."

C@@ an you imagine something good coming out of to@@ b@@ acc@@ o ?
"Th@@ ese are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be e@@ ver@@ more possible ."
I@@ mag@@ ine then just two other little changes .
"You can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing ?"
"What if you could change the s@@ per@@ m and the o@@ v@@ a , or change the ne@@ w@@ ly fer@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ ed e@@ g@@ g , and give your off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing a better chan@@ ce at a heal@@ th@@ i@@ er life — e@@ li@@ min@@ ate the di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , e@@ li@@ min@@ ate the he@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a , re@@ duce the ri@@ s@@ k of c@@ anc@@ er ?"
Wh@@ o doesn &apos;t want heal@@ th@@ i@@ er children ?
"And then , that same an@@ al@@ y@@ tic technology , that same eng@@ ine of science that can pro@@ duce the changes to pre@@ v@@ ent disease , will also en@@ able us to ad@@ op@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes , hy@@ per@@ -@@ cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties — that better mem@@ ory ."
"Wh@@ y not have the quic@@ k w@@ it of a K@@ en J@@ en@@ n@@ ings , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally if you can au@@ g@@ ment it with the next gener@@ ation of the W@@ at@@ son mach@@ ine ?"
Why not have the quic@@ k t@@ wit@@ ch m@@ us@@ c@@ le that will en@@ able you to ru@@ n fa@@ ster and longer ?
Why not live longer ?
These will be ir@@ re@@ si@@ sti@@ ble .
"And when we are at a position where we can pas@@ s it on to the next gener@@ ation , and we can ad@@ op@@ t the at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes we want , we will have con@@ ver@@ ted ol@@ d@@ -@@ st@@ y@@ le evolution into ne@@ o@@ -@@ evolution ."
"We &apos;ll take a process that n@@ orm@@ ally might re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e 1@@ 00@@ ,000 years , and we can com@@ pre@@ ss it down to a thous@@ and years — and maybe even in the next 100 years ."
"Th@@ ese are cho@@ ic@@ es that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them ."
"@@ W@@ ill we use these cho@@ ic@@ es to make a society that is better , that is more success@@ ful , that is kin@@ der ?"
"O@@ r , will we sel@@ ec@@ tively cho@@ ose different at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?"
"@@ W@@ ill we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more uni@@ form , or more ro@@ b@@ ust and more ver@@ sa@@ ti@@ le ?"
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
"And most prof@@ oun@@ dly of all , will we ever be able to devel@@ o@@ p the w@@ is@@ dom , and to in@@ her@@ it the w@@ is@@ dom , that we &apos;ll need to make these cho@@ ic@@ es wi@@ se@@ ly ?"
"For better or worse , and so@@ on@@ er than you may think , these cho@@ ic@@ es will be up to us ."

"One thing the world ne@@ e@@ ds , one thing this country de@@ s@@ per@@ ately ne@@ e@@ ds is a better way of conduc@@ ting our poli@@ tical de@@ b@@ ates ."
We need to re@@ disco@@ ver the l@@ ost ar@@ t of democ@@ ra@@ tic ar@@ g@@ ument .
I have a sug@@ g@@ es@@ tion .
But we too r@@ ar@@ ely ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ate and de@@ f@@ end and ar@@ gu@@ e about those big moral questions in our poli@@ tics .
So what I would like to do today is have something of a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion .
"F@@ irst , let me take a fa@@ m@@ ous ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ her who wr@@ ote about those questions of j@@ us@@ tice and mor@@ ality , give you a very sh@@ ort lec@@ ture on A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le of an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ ens , A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le &apos;s theory of j@@ us@@ tice , and then have a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion here to see whether A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le &apos;s ideas actually in@@ form the way we think and ar@@ gu@@ e about questions today ."
"So , are you ready for the lec@@ ture ?"
"A@@ cc@@ ord@@ ing to A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le , j@@ us@@ tice means giving people what they de@@ ser@@ ve ."
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the lec@@ ture .
"( Laughter ) Now , you may say , well , that &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous enough ."
The real questions beg@@ in when it comes to ar@@ gu@@ ing about who de@@ ser@@ ves what and why .
T@@ a@@ ke the example of flu@@ tes .
Su@@ pp@@ ose we &apos;re dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ ting flu@@ tes .
Wh@@ o should get the best ones ?
Let &apos;s see what people — What would you say ?
Wh@@ o should get the best flu@@ te ?
You can just call it out .
( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : R@@ an@@ dom . ) M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el S@@ an@@ de@@ l : A@@ t ran@@ dom . You would do it by l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
O@@ r by the first person to r@@ us@@ h into the h@@ all to get them .
How many say the best flu@@ te play@@ ers ?
( Laughter ) But here &apos;s a har@@ der question .
"Wh@@ y do you think , those of you who v@@ ot@@ ed this way , that the best flu@@ tes should go to the best flu@@ te play@@ ers ?"
Pe@@ ter : The gre@@ at@@ est bene@@ f@@ it to all .
M@@ S : The gre@@ at@@ est bene@@ f@@ it to all .
We &apos;ll hear better music if the best flu@@ tes should go to the best flu@@ te play@@ ers .
That &apos;s Pe@@ ter ? ( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : Pe@@ ter . ) M@@ S : A@@ ll right .
"Well , it &apos;s a good reason ."
We &apos;ll all be better off if good music is play@@ ed rather than ter@@ ri@@ ble music .
"But Pe@@ ter , A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le doesn &apos;t ag@@ ree with you that that &apos;s the reason ."
That &apos;s all right .
A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le had a different reason for saying the best flu@@ tes should go to the best flu@@ te play@@ ers .
"He says that to reason about just dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of a thing , we have to reason about , and some@@ times ar@@ gu@@ e about , the pur@@ p@@ ose of the thing , or the social acti@@ vity — in this case , mu@@ sical per@@ form@@ ance ."
"And the point , the essenti@@ al nature , of mu@@ sical per@@ form@@ ance is to pro@@ duce exc@@ ell@@ ent music ."
It &apos;ll be a happy b@@ y@@ produc@@ t that we &apos;ll all bene@@ f@@ it .
"But when we think about j@@ us@@ tice , A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le says , what we really need to think about is the essenti@@ al nature of the acti@@ vity in question and the qu@@ ali@@ ties that are wor@@ th hon@@ or@@ ing and ad@@ m@@ ir@@ ing and recogn@@ iz@@ ing ."
"Now , flu@@ tes may seem ... the dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of flu@@ tes may seem a tri@@ vi@@ al case ."
Let &apos;s take a con@@ te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary example of the di@@ sp@@ u@@ te about j@@ us@@ tice .
It had to do with golf .
"C@@ a@@ se@@ y M@@ arti@@ n — a few years ago , C@@ a@@ se@@ y M@@ arti@@ n — did any of you hear about him ?"
"He was a very good gol@@ f@@ er , but he had a dis@@ ab@@ i@@ lity ."
"He had a bad le@@ g , a cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory problem , that made it very pain@@ ful for him to wal@@ k the course ."
"In fact , it car@@ ri@@ ed ri@@ s@@ k of in@@ j@@ ury ."
"He asked the P@@ G@@ A , the P@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ onal G@@ ol@@ f@@ ers &apos; A@@ s@@ soci@@ ation , for per@@ mis@@ sion to use a golf car@@ t in the P@@ G@@ A t@@ ourn@@ am@@ ents ."
"They said , &quot; &quot; No ."
"Now that would give you an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge . &quot; &quot; He su@@ ed , and his case went all the way to the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , believe it or not , the case over the golf car@@ t , because the la@@ w says that the dis@@ ab@@ led must be ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ated , pro@@ vi@@ ded the ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation does not change the essenti@@ al nature of the acti@@ vity ."
"He says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a great gol@@ f@@ er ."
I want to com@@ pe@@ te .
But I need a golf car@@ t to get from one h@@ ole to the next . &quot; &quot; Su@@ pp@@ ose you were on the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
Su@@ pp@@ ose you were deci@@ ding the j@@ us@@ tice of this case .
How many here would say that C@@ a@@ se@@ y M@@ arti@@ n does have a right to use a golf car@@ t ?
"And how many say , no , he doesn &apos;t ?"
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s take a p@@ ol@@ l , show of h@@ ands ."
How many would ru@@ le in fa@@ v@@ or of C@@ a@@ se@@ y M@@ arti@@ n ?
And how many would not ? How many would say he doesn &apos;t ?
"A@@ ll right , we have a good divi@@ sion of op@@ ini@@ on here ."
"S@@ ome@@ one who would not gr@@ ant C@@ a@@ se@@ y M@@ arti@@ n the right to a golf car@@ t , what would be your reason ?"
"@@ R@@ a@@ ise your hand , and we &apos;ll try to get you a mic@@ ro@@ ph@@ one ."
( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : It &apos;d be an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge . ) M@@ S : It would be an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge if he gets to ri@@ de in a golf car@@ t .
"A@@ ll right , those of you , I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf car@@ t wor@@ ry about an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge ."
How would you answer the ob@@ jec@@ tion ?
"@@ Y@@ es , all right ."
A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : The car@@ t &apos;s not part of the ga@@ me .
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e : The car@@ t &apos;s not part of the ga@@ me .
M@@ S : But what about wal@@ king from h@@ ole to h@@ ole ?
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e : It doesn &apos;t matter ; it &apos;s not part of the ga@@ me .
M@@ S : W@@ al@@ king the course is not part of the ga@@ me of golf ?
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e : No@@ t in my book , it isn &apos;t ."
"M@@ S : A@@ ll right . St@@ ay there , Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ o has an answer for Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e ?
"A@@ ll right , who has an answer for Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e ?"
What would you say ?
"A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : The end@@ ur@@ ance el@@ ement is a very important part of the ga@@ me , wal@@ king all those h@@ ol@@ es ."
M@@ S : W@@ al@@ king all those h@@ ol@@ es ?
That &apos;s part of the ga@@ me of golf ? ( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely . ) M@@ S : What &apos;s your na@@ me ? ( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : W@@ ar@@ re@@ n . ) M@@ S : W@@ ar@@ re@@ n .
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e , what do you say to W@@ ar@@ re@@ n ?"
Ch@@ ar@@ ley : I &apos;ll s@@ tic@@ k to my ori@@ g@@ in@@ al the@@ s@@ is .
W@@ ar@@ re@@ n : I am not a gol@@ f@@ er .
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ ley : And I am . ( M@@ S : O@@ kay . ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , it &apos;s interesting ."
"In the case , in the lo@@ wer cour@@ t , they br@@ ought in gol@@ f@@ ing gre@@ at@@ s to t@@ es@@ ti@@ f@@ y on this very is@@ sue ."
I@@ s wal@@ king the course essenti@@ al to the ga@@ me ?
And they br@@ ought in J@@ ack N@@ ic@@ k@@ la@@ us and Ar@@ no@@ ld P@@ al@@ m@@ er .
And what do you supp@@ ose they all said ?
Y@@ es . They ag@@ re@@ ed with W@@ ar@@ re@@ n .
"They said , y@@ es , wal@@ king the course is str@@ en@@ u@@ ous phy@@ sical ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se ."
The f@@ ati@@ gu@@ e fac@@ tor is an important part of golf .
And so it would change the f@@ und@@ am@@ ental nature of the ga@@ me to give him the golf car@@ t .
"Now , no@@ tice , something interesting — Well , I should tell you about the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t first ."
The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t decided .
What do you supp@@ ose they said ?
"They said y@@ es , that C@@ a@@ se@@ y M@@ arti@@ n must be pro@@ vi@@ ded a golf car@@ t ."
"S@@ even to two , they r@@ ul@@ ed ."
"What was interesting about their r@@ ul@@ ing and about the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion we &apos;ve just had is that the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion about the right , the j@@ us@@ tice , of the matter dep@@ en@@ ded on fig@@ uring out what is the essenti@@ al nature of golf ."
And the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t j@@ us@@ tic@@ es w@@ re@@ st@@ led with that question .
"And J@@ us@@ tice St@@ even@@ s , wr@@ iting for the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity , said he had read all about the history of golf , and the essenti@@ al point of the ga@@ me is to get very small b@@ all from one place into a h@@ ole in as few stro@@ kes as possible , and that wal@@ king was not essenti@@ al , but inci@@ d@@ ental ."
"Now , there were two dis@@ sen@@ ters , one of wh@@ om was J@@ us@@ tice S@@ c@@ ali@@ a ."
"He wouldn &apos;t have gr@@ an@@ ted the car@@ t , and he had a very interesting dis@@ s@@ ent ."
It &apos;s interesting because he re@@ jec@@ ted the A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ e@@ li@@ an pre@@ mi@@ se under@@ l@@ ying the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity &apos;s op@@ ini@@ on .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
&quot; &quot; T@@ o say that something is essenti@@ al is ordin@@ ari@@ ly to say that it is nec@@ ess@@ ary to the achi@@ ev@@ ement of a certain ob@@ ject .
J@@ us@@ tice S@@ c@@ ali@@ a &apos;s op@@ ini@@ on is ques@@ tion@@ able for two reas@@ ons .
"F@@ irst , no real sp@@ orts f@@ an would talk that way ."
"( Laughter ) I@@ f we had thought that the r@@ ul@@ es of the sp@@ orts we care about are mer@@ ely ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary , rather than de@@ sign@@ ed to call for@@ th the vir@@ tu@@ es and the exc@@ ell@@ ences that we think are wor@@ thy of ad@@ m@@ ir@@ ing , we wouldn &apos;t care about the out@@ come of the ga@@ me ."
It &apos;s also ob@@ jec@@ tion@@ able on a second ground .
"O@@ n the face of it , it see@@ m@@ ed to be — this de@@ b@@ ate about the golf car@@ t — an ar@@ g@@ ument about fa@@ ir@@ ness , what &apos;s an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge ."
"But if fa@@ ir@@ ness were the only thing at sta@@ ke , there would have been an easy and ob@@ vi@@ ous s@@ olution ."
"But le@@ tting everyone ri@@ de in a car@@ t would have been , I su@@ spe@@ ct , more an@@ a@@ the@@ m@@ a to the gol@@ f@@ ing gre@@ at@@ s and to the P@@ G@@ A , even than making an ex@@ cep@@ tion for C@@ a@@ se@@ y M@@ arti@@ n ."
Why ?
Let me put the point as de@@ lica@@ tely as possible : G@@ ol@@ f@@ ers are a little sen@@ si@@ tive about the a@@ th@@ le@@ tic st@@ at@@ us of their ga@@ me .
"( Laughter ) A@@ f@@ ter all , there &apos;s no run@@ ning or j@@ u@@ mp@@ ing , and the b@@ all st@@ ands still . ( Laughter )"
"So if gol@@ f@@ ing is the kind of ga@@ me that can be play@@ ed while ri@@ ding around in a golf car@@ t , it would be hard to con@@ f@@ er on the gol@@ f@@ ing gre@@ at@@ s the st@@ at@@ us that we con@@ f@@ er , the hon@@ or and recogn@@ ition that goes to tru@@ ly great a@@ th@@ le@@ tes ."
"That il@@ lu@@ str@@ ates that with golf , as with flu@@ tes , it &apos;s hard to deci@@ de the question of what j@@ us@@ tice re@@ qui@@ res , without gr@@ app@@ ling with the question , &quot; &quot; What is the essenti@@ al nature of the acti@@ vity in question , and what qu@@ ali@@ ties , what exc@@ ell@@ ences connec@@ ted with that acti@@ vity , are wor@@ thy of hon@@ or and recogn@@ ition ? &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s take a fin@@ al example that &apos;s pr@@ om@@ in@@ ent in con@@ te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary poli@@ tical de@@ b@@ ate : sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ."
"There are those who fa@@ v@@ or state recogn@@ ition only of tra@@ di@@ tional marri@@ age between one man and one woman , and there are those who fa@@ v@@ or state recogn@@ ition of sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ."
How many here fa@@ v@@ or the first poli@@ c@@ y : the state should recogn@@ ize tra@@ di@@ tional marri@@ age only ?
"And how many fa@@ v@@ or the second , sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ?"
"The op@@ p@@ on@@ ents of sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age say that the pur@@ p@@ ose of marri@@ age , f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ ally , is pro@@ cre@@ ation , and that &apos;s what &apos;s wor@@ thy of hon@@ or@@ ing and recogn@@ iz@@ ing and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing ."
"So with flu@@ tes , with golf car@@ ts , and even with a fi@@ er@@ ce@@ ly con@@ test@@ ed question like sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age , A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le has a point ."
V@@ ery hard to ar@@ gu@@ e about j@@ us@@ tice without first ar@@ gu@@ ing about the pur@@ p@@ ose of social in@@ sti@@ tu@@ tions and about what qu@@ ali@@ ties are wor@@ thy of hon@@ or and recogn@@ ition .
"So let &apos;s ste@@ p back from these ca@@ ses and see how they shed light on the way we might impro@@ ve , el@@ ev@@ ate , the terms of poli@@ tical dis@@ course in the United States , and for that matter , around the world ."
"There is a t@@ end@@ enc@@ y to think that if we eng@@ age too direc@@ tly with moral questions in poli@@ tics , that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for di@@ sa@@ gre@@ ement , and for that matter , a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance and co@@ er@@ ci@@ on ."
"So better to sh@@ y away from , to i@@ gn@@ ore , the moral and the religi@@ ous con@@ vic@@ tions that people bring to ci@@ vi@@ c life ."
"That , it seems to me , is a way to beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore the ar@@ t of democ@@ ra@@ tic ar@@ g@@ ument ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"Th@@ ank you very much . Th@@ an@@ ks . Thank you . Ch@@ r@@ is . Th@@ an@@ ks , Ch@@ r@@ is . Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : F@@ rom flu@@ tes to golf cour@@ se@@ s@@ "
to sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age — that was a gen@@ i@@ us l@@ ink .
"Now look , you &apos;re a pi@@ on@@ e@@ er of op@@ en education ."
Y@@ our lec@@ ture ser@@ ies was one of the first to do it big .
What &apos;s your vi@@ sion for the next p@@ ha@@ se of this ?
"M@@ S : Well , I think that it is possible ."
"C@@ A : So you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , inv@@ iting questions , but with people from China and India jo@@ ining in ?"
"M@@ S : R@@ ight . We did a little bit of it here with 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 people in L@@ ong Be@@ ach , and we do it in a cla@@ ss@@ room at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard with about 1@@ ,000 students ."
"@@ W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be interesting to take this way of thinking and ar@@ gu@@ ing , eng@@ ag@@ ing ser@@ i@@ ously with big moral questions , expl@@ or@@ ing cul@@ tur@@ al differ@@ ences and con@@ ne@@ ct through a live vi@@ de@@ o h@@ oo@@ k@@ up , students in Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing and M@@ um@@ ba@@ i and in C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge , M@@ as@@ s@@ ach@@ u@@ se@@ t@@ ts and create a global cla@@ ss@@ room ."
That &apos;s what I would love to do .
"So I work in marke@@ ting , which I love , but my first pas@@ sion was physics , a pas@@ sion br@@ ought to me by a wonderful school teacher , when I had a little less gr@@ ay ha@@ ir ."
So he ta@@ u@@ ght me that physics is c@@ ool because it teach@@ es us so much about the world around us .
So quic@@ k show of h@@ ands — who studi@@ ed some marke@@ ting in univers@@ ity ?
Wh@@ o studi@@ ed some physics in univers@@ ity ?
P@@ re@@ tty good . And at school ?
"O@@ kay , lots of you ."
"So , hop@@ e@@ fully this will bring back some happy , or pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly some sli@@ gh@@ tly dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing me@@ mor@@ ies ."
"So , physics and marke@@ ting ."
We &apos;ll start with something very simple — Ne@@ w@@ ton &apos;s L@@ a@@ w : &quot; The force equ@@ als ma@@ ss times acc@@ el@@ er@@ ation . &quot;
This is something that perhaps T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish A@@ ir@@ l@@ ines should have studi@@ ed a bit more car@@ e@@ fully before they r@@ an this ca@@ mp@@ a@@ i@@ gn .
"( Laughter ) But if we re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge this for@@ mul@@ a quic@@ kly , we can get to acc@@ el@@ er@@ ation equ@@ als force over ma@@ ss , which means that for a lar@@ ger partic@@ le — a lar@@ ger ma@@ ss — it re@@ qui@@ res more force to change its direc@@ tion ."
"It &apos;s the same with br@@ ands : the more ma@@ s@@ sive a br@@ and , the more b@@ ag@@ g@@ age it has , the more force is needed to change its pos@@ i@@ tion@@ ing ."
And that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons why Ar@@ th@@ ur An@@ der@@ s@@ en ch@@ ose to la@@ un@@ ch A@@ cc@@ ent@@ ure rather than try to per@@ su@@ a@@ de the world that An@@ der@@ s@@ en &apos;s could st@@ and for something other than ac@@ coun@@ t@@ anc@@ y .
"It expla@@ ins why H@@ oo@@ ver found it very difficult to per@@ su@@ a@@ de the world that it was more than v@@ ac@@ u@@ um c@@ le@@ an@@ ers , and why comp@@ an@@ ies like Uni@@ le@@ ver and P &@@ a@@ mp@@ ; G keep br@@ ands se@@ par@@ ate , like A@@ ri@@ el and P@@ r@@ ing@@ les and D@@ ove rather than having one gi@@ ant par@@ ent br@@ and ."
"The marke@@ ting is , the big@@ ger a br@@ and , the more difficult it is to re@@ position it ."
So think about a p@@ ort@@ fo@@ li@@ o of br@@ ands or maybe new br@@ ands for new v@@ en@@ tures .
"Now , who remem@@ bers H@@ e@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g &apos;s un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty pr@@ inci@@ ple ?"
G@@ e@@ tting a little more tech@@ ni@@ cal now .
"So this says that it &apos;s imp@@ os@@ sible , by defin@@ ition , to measure ex@@ actly the state — i@@ .@@ e@@ . , the position — and the mom@@ en@@ tum of a partic@@ le , because the act of meas@@ uring it , by defin@@ ition , changes it ."
"So to explain that — if you &apos;ve got an el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary partic@@ le and you sh@@ ine a light on it , then the ph@@ ot@@ on of light has mom@@ en@@ tum , which kno@@ c@@ ks the partic@@ le , so you don &apos;t know where it was before you looked at it ."
"B@@ y meas@@ uring it , the act of meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment changes it ."
The act of observ@@ ation changes it .
It &apos;s the same in marke@@ ting .
"So with the act of ob@@ ser@@ ving con@@ su@@ m@@ ers , changes their behavi@@ or ."
"Th@@ ink about the group of mom@@ s who are talking about their wonderful children in a fo@@ c@@ us group , and almost n@@ one of them buy lots of j@@ un@@ k f@@ ood ."
"And yet , M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s sel@@ ls hund@@ re@@ ds of m@@ illions of bur@@ g@@ ers every year ."
"@@ Y@@ et , at Google , we know it &apos;s the num@@ ber@@ -@@ one sear@@ ched for ca@@ te@@ g@@ ory ."
"So l@@ uc@@ ki@@ ly , the science — no , s@@ or@@ ry — the marke@@ ting is getting ea@@ si@@ er ."
"@@ L@@ uc@@ ki@@ ly , with now better poin@@ t@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ s@@ ale tr@@ ac@@ king , more di@@ g@@ ital medi@@ a con@@ su@@ mp@@ tion , you can measure more what con@@ su@@ m@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they do ."
"So the physics is you can never ac@@ cur@@ ately and ex@@ actly measure a partic@@ le , because the observ@@ ation changes it ."
"The marke@@ ting is — the mes@@ sage for marke@@ ting is — that try to measure what con@@ su@@ m@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate they &apos;ll do ."
"What this means is you can ga@@ ther more and more data around a hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is or a pos@@ i@@ tion@@ ing , and it will str@@ eng@@ then it , but it will not con@@ clu@@ si@@ vely pro@@ ve it ."
And only one con@@ tr@@ ary data point can b@@ low your theory out of the water .
So if we take an example — P@@ to@@ le@@ my had do@@ z@@ ens of data poin@@ ts to supp@@ ort his theory that the planets would r@@ ot@@ ate around the Earth .
It only took one ro@@ b@@ ust observ@@ ation from C@@ op@@ er@@ n@@ ic@@ us to b@@ low that idea out of the water .
"T@@ a@@ ke B@@ P — they sp@@ ent m@@ illions of p@@ oun@@ ds over many years buil@@ ding up its cre@@ d@@ enti@@ als as an environ@@ m@@ ent@@ ally fri@@ end@@ ly br@@ and , but then one little ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
Th@@ ink about T@@ o@@ y@@ ot@@ a .
"It was , for a long time , re@@ ver@@ ed as the most reli@@ able of car@@ s , and then they had the big rec@@ all inci@@ dent ."
"And T@@ i@@ ger W@@ oo@@ ds , for a long time , the per@@ fe@@ ct br@@ and am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"Well , you know the story ."
"( Laughter ) So the physics is that you cannot pro@@ ve a hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is , but it &apos;s easy to dis@@ pro@@ ve it — any hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is is s@@ ha@@ k@@ y ."
"And the marke@@ ting is that not matter how much you &apos;ve in@@ ve@@ st@@ ed in your br@@ and , one bad wee@@ k can under@@ m@@ ine de@@ ca@@ des of good work ."
So be really car@@ e@@ ful to try and a@@ vo@@ id the s@@ cre@@ w@@ -@@ u@@ ps that can under@@ m@@ ine your br@@ and .
"And la@@ st@@ ly , to the sli@@ gh@@ tly ob@@ sc@@ ure world of entropy — the second la@@ w of ther@@ mo@@ d@@ y@@ n@@ am@@ ic@@ s ."
"This says that entropy , which is a measure of the dis@@ order of a system , will always increase ."
The same is true of marke@@ ting .
"If we go back 20 years , the one mes@@ sage pretty much contro@@ l@@ led by one marke@@ ting man@@ ag@@ er could pretty much de@@ f@@ ine a br@@ and ."
"But where we are today , things have chang@@ ed ."
You can get a strong br@@ and i@@ ma@@ ge or a mes@@ sage and put it out there like the Con@@ serv@@ ative P@@ ar@@ ty did ear@@ li@@ er this year with their elec@@ tion pos@@ ter .
But then you l@@ ose contro@@ l of it .
"@@ W@@ it@@ h the kind of di@@ g@@ ital com@@ ment cre@@ ation and dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion to@@ ols that are a@@ va@@ il@@ able now to every con@@ su@@ m@@ er , it &apos;s imp@@ os@@ sible to contro@@ l where it goes ."
"@@ Y@@ our br@@ and star@@ ts being dis@@ per@@ sed , ( Laughter ) it gets more c@@ ha@@ o@@ tic . ( Laughter )"
It &apos;s out of your contro@@ l . ( Laughter )
I actually saw him spea@@ k — he did a good job .
"But while this may be un@@ se@@ tt@@ ling for marke@@ ters , it &apos;s actually a good thing ."
"This dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of br@@ and energy gets your br@@ and cl@@ os@@ er to the people , more in with the people ."
"It makes this dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of energy a democ@@ ra@@ ti@@ zing force , which is ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely good for your br@@ and ."
"So , the le@@ s@@ son from physics is that entropy will always increase ; it &apos;s a f@@ und@@ am@@ ental la@@ w ."
The mes@@ sage for marke@@ ting is that your br@@ and is more dis@@ per@@ sed .
"You can &apos;t fi@@ ght it , so em@@ br@@ ace it and find a way to work with it ."
Thank you .

"We are going to take a quic@@ k vo@@ y@@ age over the cogn@@ itive history of the 20@@ th century , because d@@ uring that century , our min@@ ds have al@@ ter@@ ed d@@ ra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally ."
"As you all know , the car@@ s that people dro@@ ve in 19@@ 00 have al@@ ter@@ ed because the ro@@ a@@ ds are better and because of technology ."
"And our min@@ ds have al@@ ter@@ ed , too ."
"Now , this d@@ ra@@ ma@@ tic change was d@@ ra@@ wn to my att@@ en@@ tion through ma@@ s@@ sive I@@ .@@ Q@@ . ga@@ ins over time , and these have been tru@@ ly ma@@ s@@ sive ."
"That is , we don &apos;t just get a few more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . te@@ sts ."
We get far more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . te@@ sts than each su@@ c@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing gener@@ ation back to the time that they were inv@@ en@@ ted .
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , if you sc@@ ore the people a century ago against modern n@@ or@@ ms , they would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 70 ."
"If you sc@@ ore us against their n@@ or@@ ms , we would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 1@@ 30 ."
Now this has ra@@ ised all s@@ orts of questions .
W@@ ere our im@@ medi@@ ate an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors on the ver@@ ge of mental re@@ t@@ ar@@ d@@ ation ?
Because 70 is n@@ orm@@ ally the sc@@ ore for mental re@@ t@@ ar@@ d@@ ation .
O@@ r are we on the ver@@ ge of all being gi@@ f@@ ted ?
Because 1@@ 30 is the cu@@ tting l@@ ine for gi@@ f@@ te@@ d@@ ness .
"Now I &apos;m going to try and ar@@ gu@@ e for a th@@ ir@@ d al@@ ter@@ nati@@ ve that &apos;s much more il@@ l@@ um@@ in@@ ating than ei@@ ther of those , and to put this into per@@ spec@@ tive , let &apos;s imagine that a M@@ arti@@ an came down to Earth and found a ru@@ ined ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation ."
"And this M@@ arti@@ an was an ar@@ c@@ ha@@ e@@ o@@ logi@@ st , and they found s@@ co@@ res , t@@ ar@@ get s@@ co@@ res , that people had used for sho@@ ot@@ ing ."
"And first they looked at 18@@ 6@@ 5 , and they found that in a minu@@ te , people had only put one b@@ ul@@ let in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e ."
"And then they found , in 18@@ 9@@ 8 , that they &apos;d put about five b@@ ul@@ le@@ ts in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e in a minu@@ te ."
And then about 19@@ 1@@ 8 they put a hundred b@@ ul@@ le@@ ts in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e .
"And ini@@ ti@@ ally , that ar@@ c@@ ha@@ e@@ o@@ logi@@ st would be ba@@ ff@@ led ."
"They would say , look , these te@@ sts were de@@ sign@@ ed to find out how much people were ste@@ ad@@ y of hand , how ke@@ en their e@@ ye@@ sight was , whether they had contro@@ l of their we@@ ap@@ on ."
How could these per@@ form@@ anc@@ es have es@@ cal@@ ated to this en@@ orm@@ ous de@@ g@@ ree ?
"Well we now know , of course , the answer ."
"And , in other words , it was the equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment that was in the h@@ ands of the average sol@@ di@@ er that was respon@@ sible , not gre@@ ater ke@@ en@@ ness of ey@@ e or ste@@ ad@@ iness of hand ."
"Now what we have to imagine is the mental arti@@ l@@ l@@ ery that we have pic@@ ked up over those hundred years , and I think again that another thin@@ ker will help us here , and that &apos;s L@@ u@@ ri@@ a ."
"He found that they were re@@ sist@@ ant to de@@ duc@@ ing the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical , to spe@@ cul@@ ating about what might be , and he found fin@@ ally that they didn &apos;t de@@ al well with ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions or using logi@@ c on those ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions ."
Now let me give you a sa@@ mple of some of his inter@@ vie@@ ws .
He tal@@ ked to the head man of a person in r@@ ur@@ al R@@ us@@ si@@ a .
"They &apos;d only had , as people had in 19@@ 00 , about four years of scho@@ ol@@ ing ."
"And he asked that particular person , what do c@@ ro@@ ws and fi@@ sh have in common ?"
"And the f@@ ell@@ ow said , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely nothing ."
"You know , I can e@@ at a fi@@ sh . I can &apos;t e@@ at a c@@ row ."
A c@@ row can pe@@ ck at a fi@@ sh .
"The other is a b@@ ir@@ d . &quot; &quot; And he was interest@@ ed , effec@@ tively , in what he could do with those con@@ cre@@ te ob@@ jec@@ ts ."
"And then L@@ u@@ ri@@ a went to another person , and he said to them , &quot; &quot; There are no ca@@ m@@ el@@ s in G@@ er@@ many ."
H@@ am@@ bur@@ g is a c@@ ity in G@@ er@@ many .
"And L@@ u@@ ri@@ a said , &quot; &quot; But what do my words imp@@ ly ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s a small village , and there &apos;s no room for ca@@ m@@ el@@ s . &quot; &quot; In other words , he was un@@ w@@ il@@ ling to treat this as anything but a con@@ cre@@ te problem , and he was used to ca@@ m@@ el@@ s being in villa@@ g@@ es , and he was quite un@@ able to use the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical , to ask hi@@ m@@ self what if there were no ca@@ m@@ el@@ s in G@@ er@@ many ."
"And L@@ u@@ ri@@ a said , &quot; &quot; A@@ t the N@@ or@@ th P@@ ole , there is always s@@ now ."
"Wh@@ er@@ ever there is always s@@ now , the be@@ ar@@ s are wh@@ ite ."
"What col@@ or are the be@@ ar@@ s at the N@@ or@@ th P@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; And the respon@@ se was , &quot; &quot; S@@ uch a thing is to be se@@ tt@@ led by t@@ es@@ ti@@ mon@@ y ."
They wer@@ en &apos;t w@@ il@@ ling to eng@@ age in this .
"One of them said to L@@ u@@ ri@@ a , &quot; &quot; How can we sol@@ ve things that ar@@ en &apos;t real problems ?"
N@@ one of these problems are real .
And let me give you a few il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tions .
"F@@ irst , almost all of us today get a high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a ."
"That is , we &apos;ve g@@ one from four to eight years of education to 12 years of form@@ al education , and 5@@ 2 percent of Americ@@ ans have actually experienc@@ ed some t@@ yp@@ e of ter@@ ti@@ ary education ."
You can &apos;t do science without pro@@ pos@@ ing hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses .
You can &apos;t do science without making it lo@@ g@@ ically con@@ sist@@ ent .
"They were things like , what are the cap@@ it@@ als of the 4@@ 4 or 45 st@@ ates that exist@@ ed at that time ?"
"When they looked at the exa@@ ms that the state of O@@ hi@@ o gave in 19@@ 9@@ 0 , they were all about ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions ."
"They were things like , why is the lar@@ gest c@@ ity of a state r@@ ar@@ ely the cap@@ ital ?"
They put it in H@@ ar@@ ri@@ s@@ bur@@ g rather than P@@ h@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ p@@ hi@@ a .
So the ten@@ or of education has chang@@ ed .
"We are edu@@ ca@@ ting people to take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously , to use ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions , and to l@@ ink them lo@@ g@@ ically ."
What about emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ?
"Well , in 19@@ 00 , three percent of Americ@@ ans pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed profes@@ sions that were cogn@@ i@@ tively de@@ m@@ anding ."
O@@ n@@ ly three percent were la@@ w@@ y@@ ers or doc@@ tors or teachers .
"T@@ o@@ day , 3@@ 5 percent of Americ@@ ans pr@@ ac@@ tice cogn@@ i@@ tively de@@ m@@ anding profes@@ sions , not only to the profes@@ sions pro@@ per like la@@ w@@ y@@ er or doc@@ tor or scienti@@ st or lec@@ tu@@ re@@ r , but many , many sub@@ -@@ profes@@ sions having to do with being a tech@@ n@@ ici@@ an , a computer progra@@ mm@@ er ."
A whole ran@@ ge of profes@@ sions now make cogn@@ itive de@@ m@@ ands .
And it &apos;s not just that we have many more people in cogn@@ i@@ tively de@@ m@@ anding profes@@ sions .
The profes@@ sions have been up@@ gra@@ ded .
"C@@ om@@ p@@ are the doc@@ tor in 19@@ 00 , who really had only a few tri@@ c@@ ks up his s@@ le@@ e@@ ve , with the modern gener@@ al pr@@ acti@@ tion@@ er or speci@@ ali@@ st , with years of scienti@@ fi@@ c tra@@ ining ."
They went far be@@ y@@ on@@ d that 19@@ 00 b@@ an@@ ker .
They had to get comp@@ lica@@ ted C@@ D@@ O@@ -@@ s@@ qu@@ ar@@ ed in order to b@@ und@@ le de@@ b@@ t together and make de@@ b@@ t look as if it were actually a prof@@ it@@ able as@@ set .
O@@ r take a far@@ m@@ er today .
I take the far@@ m man@@ ag@@ er of today as very different from the far@@ m@@ er of 19@@ 00 .
It &apos;s also been the up@@ gra@@ ding of t@@ as@@ ks like la@@ w@@ y@@ er and doc@@ tor and what have you that have made de@@ m@@ ands on our cogn@@ itive fac@@ ul@@ ties .
But I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about education and emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .
I &apos;m pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly a moral ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ her .
"Now over the last century , in developed n@@ ations like America , moral de@@ b@@ ate has es@@ cal@@ ated because we take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously , and we also take univers@@ als ser@@ i@@ ously and look for logical connec@@ tions ."
"When I came home in 19@@ 5@@ 5 from univers@@ ity at the time of M@@ arti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , a lot of people came home at that time and started having ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents with their par@@ ents and grand@@ par@@ ents ."
"M@@ y father was born in 18@@ 8@@ 5 , and he was mil@@ dly r@@ ac@@ i@@ ally bi@@ as@@ ed ."
( Laughter ) But he did have a sense that black people were in@@ f@@ eri@@ or .
"And when we said to our par@@ ents and grand@@ par@@ ents , &quot; How would you feel if tom@@ or@@ row mor@@ ning you w@@ o@@ ke up black ? &quot;"
they said that is the d@@ um@@ best thing you &apos;ve ever said .
"In other words , they were fi@@ x@@ ed in the con@@ cre@@ te mo@@ res and at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des they had in@@ her@@ ited ."
How would you feel about that ?
"And if someone of the ol@@ der gener@@ ation says , well , our govern@@ ment ta@@ kes care of us , and it &apos;s up to their govern@@ ment to take care of them , they &apos;re just not w@@ il@@ ling to take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"O@@ r take an I@@ s@@ la@@ mic father wh@@ ose daughter has been r@@ ap@@ ed , and he feel@@ s he &apos;s hon@@ or@@ -@@ b@@ ound to k@@ ill her ."
They &apos;re just in@@ her@@ ited mo@@ res .
"T@@ o@@ day we would say something like , well , imagine you were kno@@ c@@ ked un@@ con@@ sci@@ ous and so@@ dom@@ iz@@ ed ."
"And he would say , well that &apos;s not in the K@@ or@@ an ."
That &apos;s not one of the pr@@ inci@@ pl@@ es I &apos;ve got .
"Well you , today , univers@@ aliz@@ e your pr@@ inci@@ pl@@ es ."
You state them as ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions and you use logi@@ c on them .
"You have to say , well , bl@@ ac@@ k@@ ness of sk@@ in , you cou@@ ldn &apos;t suff@@ er just for that ."
It must be that bl@@ ac@@ ks are some@@ how ta@@ in@@ ted .
"And you can get moral ar@@ g@@ ument off the ground , then , because you &apos;re not tre@@ ating moral pr@@ inci@@ pl@@ es as con@@ cre@@ te enti@@ ties ."
"You &apos;re tre@@ ating them as univers@@ als , to be r@@ en@@ der@@ ed con@@ sist@@ ent by logi@@ c ."
That &apos;s what ini@@ ti@@ ally got me going on cogn@@ itive history .
"If you look at the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test , you find the ga@@ ins have been gre@@ at@@ est in certain are@@ as ."
There are other parts of the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test b@@ at@@ ter@@ y that are about using logi@@ c on ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions .
"And in 19@@ 00 , people could do simple an@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es ."
"That is , if you said to them , ca@@ ts are like w@@ il@@ d@@ ca@@ ts ."
What are do@@ gs like ?
They would say w@@ ol@@ ves .
"But by 19@@ 60 , people could att@@ ack R@@ a@@ ven &apos;s on a much more s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ ca@@ ted level ."
"If you said , we &apos;ve got two s@@ qu@@ ar@@ es fol@@ lo@@ wed by a tri@@ ang@@ le , what fol@@ lo@@ ws two circ@@ les ?"
They could say a se@@ mic@@ ir@@ c@@ le .
"@@ J@@ ust as a tri@@ ang@@ le is half of a s@@ qu@@ are , a se@@ mic@@ ir@@ c@@ le is half of a circ@@ le ."
"B@@ y 20@@ 10 , college gra@@ du@@ ates , if you said two circ@@ les fol@@ lo@@ wed by a se@@ mic@@ ir@@ c@@ le , two si@@ x@@ te@@ ens fol@@ lo@@ wed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 1@@ 6 ."
"Now , I should say one thing that &apos;s very di@@ sh@@ ear@@ ten@@ ing ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t made progre@@ ss on all fron@@ ts .
"We &apos;ve no@@ tic@@ ed , in a tr@@ end am@@ ong young Americ@@ ans , that they read less history and less liter@@ ature and less material about fore@@ i@@ gn l@@ ands , and they &apos;re essenti@@ ally a@@ hi@@ st@@ ori@@ cal ."
They live in the bub@@ ble of the pres@@ ent .
They don &apos;t know the K@@ o@@ re@@ an War from the war in V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am .
They don &apos;t know who was an ally of America in World War I@@ I .
"Th@@ ink how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fi@@ f@@ th time W@@ est@@ er@@ n ar@@ mi@@ es have g@@ one to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan to put its h@@ ou@@ se in order , and if they had some idea of ex@@ actly what had happened on those four pre@@ vi@@ ous o@@ c@@ ca@@ sions ."
"( Laughter ) And that is , they had b@@ ar@@ ely left , and there was@@ n &apos;t a tr@@ ace in the s@@ and ."
O@@ r imagine how different things would be if most Americ@@ ans knew that we had been li@@ ed into four of our last six war@@ s .
But I don &apos;t want to end on a pe@@ s@@ si@@ mis@@ tic n@@ ote .
"@@ L@@ or@@ d C@@ ur@@ z@@ on once said he saw people ba@@ thing in the N@@ or@@ th S@@ e@@ a , and he said , &quot; &quot; Why did no one tell me what wh@@ ite bo@@ di@@ es the lo@@ wer ord@@ ers have ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s if they were a rep@@ ti@@ le ."
"A@@ n i@@ ma@@ ge is wor@@ th more than a thous@@ and words , so I &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few imag@@ es that I rec@@ ently cap@@ tu@@ red ."
"So by now , my talk is already 6@@ ,000 words long , and I feel like I should stop here ."
"What I am trying to do as a ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ her , as an arti@@ st , is to bring the world of ar@@ t and science together ."
"Wh@@ ether it is an i@@ ma@@ ge of a so@@ a@@ p bub@@ ble cap@@ tu@@ red at the very moment where it &apos;s bur@@ st@@ ing , as you can see in this i@@ ma@@ ge , whether it &apos;s a universe made of tiny little be@@ a@@ ds of oil pain@@ t , stran@@ ge li@@ qui@@ ds that be@@ have in very pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ways , or pain@@ t that is mo@@ d@@ el@@ ed by cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ g@@ al for@@ ces , I &apos;m always trying to l@@ ink those two fiel@@ ds together ."
"And yet , they do it in a very different way ."
Let me de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate this based on three pro@@ jec@@ ts .
The first one has to do with making sound vi@@ sible .
"Now as you may know , sound tra@@ vel@@ s in wa@@ ves , so if you have a spea@@ ker , a spea@@ ker actually does nothing else than ta@@ king the au@@ di@@ o sign@@ al , trans@@ form it into a vi@@ bra@@ tion , which is then tr@@ an@@ sp@@ or@@ ted through the air , is cap@@ tu@@ red by our e@@ ar , and trans@@ form@@ ed into an au@@ di@@ o sign@@ al again ."
"Now I was thinking , how can I make those sound wa@@ ves vi@@ sible ?"
So I came up with the fol@@ lo@@ wing se@@ tu@@ p .
"I took a spea@@ ker , I pl@@ ac@@ ed a th@@ in fo@@ il of p@@ la@@ s@@ tic on top of that spea@@ ker , and then I ad@@ ded tiny little c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ als on top of that spea@@ ker ."
"And now , if I would pl@@ ay a sound through that spea@@ ker , it would cause the c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ als to move up and down ."
"Now this happens very fa@@ st , in the bl@@ ink of an ey@@ e , so , together with L@@ G , we cap@@ tu@@ red this mo@@ tion with a ca@@ mer@@ a that is able to cap@@ ture more than 3@@ ,000 f@@ ra@@ m@@ es per second ."
Let me show you what this looks like .
( M@@ u@@ sic : &quot; &quot; T@@ ear@@ dro@@ p &quot; &quot; by M@@ as@@ sive A@@ tt@@ ack ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much .
"I ag@@ ree , it looks pretty a@@ ma@@ zing ."
But I have to tell you a fun@@ n@@ y story .
I got an in@@ do@@ or s@@ un@@ bur@@ n doing this while sho@@ ot@@ ing in L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es .
"Now in L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es , you could get a de@@ cent s@@ un@@ bur@@ n just on any of the be@@ ach@@ es , but I got m@@ ine in@@ do@@ ors , and what happened is that , if you &apos;re sho@@ ot@@ ing at 3@@ ,000 f@@ ra@@ m@@ es per second , you need to have a si@@ l@@ ly amount of light , lots of li@@ ghts ."
"What was so fun@@ n@@ y about it was that the spea@@ ker was only coming from the right side , so the right side of my face was comple@@ tely red and I looked like the P@@ h@@ an@@ tom of the O@@ per@@ a for the rest of the wee@@ k ."
Let me now turn to another pro@@ ject which inv@@ ol@@ ves less har@@ m@@ ful sub@@ st@@ anc@@ es .
H@@ as any@@ one of you heard of fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ?
"A@@ h , some of you have . E@@ x@@ c@@ ell@@ ent ."
S@@ h@@ ould I sk@@ i@@ p that part ?
( Laughter ) F@@ er@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has a very stran@@ ge behavi@@ or .
It &apos;s a li@@ qu@@ id that is comple@@ tely black .
It &apos;s got an o@@ i@@ ly con@@ sist@@ enc@@ y .
"And it &apos;s got tiny little particles of me@@ t@@ al in it , which makes it magnetic ."
"So if I now put this li@@ qu@@ id into a magnetic field , it would change its appe@@ ar@@ ance ."
Now I &apos;ve got a live de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion over here to show this to you .
"So I &apos;ve got a ca@@ mer@@ a poin@@ ting down at this pl@@ ate , and under@@ ne@@ ath that pl@@ ate , there is a magne@@ t ."
Now I &apos;m going to ad@@ d some of that fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id to that magne@@ t .
Let &apos;s just sli@@ gh@@ tly move it to the right and maybe fo@@ c@@ us it a little bit more . E@@ x@@ c@@ ell@@ ent .
So what you can see now is that the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has form@@ ed sp@@ i@@ kes .
Th@@ ose are just st@@ and@@ ard wat@@ er@@ col@@ ors that you would pain@@ t with .
"So what happened now is , when the wat@@ er@@ col@@ or was f@@ lo@@ wing into the struc@@ ture , the wat@@ er@@ col@@ ors do not mi@@ x with the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ."
That &apos;s because the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id itself is hy@@ dro@@ ph@@ o@@ bi@@ c .
That means it doesn &apos;t mi@@ x with the water .
So that was the second pro@@ ject .
"Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?"
D@@ id he dr@@ ink half a bot@@ t@@ le of wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey and then d@@ ra@@ w the h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ation he got from being dr@@ un@@ k on@@ to p@@ ap@@ er ?
"M@@ a@@ ybe you have experienc@@ ed some of those pro@@ per@@ ties before , but I am talking about the phy@@ sical pro@@ per@@ ties , not the other ones ."
"So when I op@@ en the bot@@ t@@ le , the al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es would sp@@ read in the air , and that &apos;s because al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l is a very vo@@ la@@ ti@@ le sub@@ st@@ ance ."
"And at the same time , al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l is high@@ ly f@@ la@@ mm@@ able ."
And it was with those two pro@@ per@@ ties that I was able to create the imag@@ es that you &apos;re see@@ ing right now .
Let me de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate this over here .
And what I have here is an emp@@ ty g@@ la@@ ss v@@ es@@ se@@ l .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
And now I &apos;m going to f@@ ill it with oxy@@ g@@ en and wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey .
A@@ d@@ d some more .
Now we just wa@@ it for a few secon@@ ds for the mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es to sp@@ read inside the bot@@ t@@ le .
"It goes really fa@@ st , and it &apos;s not that imp@@ re@@ s@@ sive ."
"So the imag@@ es that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a f@@ la@@ me st@@ op@@ p@@ ed in time while it is tra@@ vel@@ ing through the bot@@ t@@ le , and you have to imagine it was f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed around 18@@ 0 de@@ gre@@ es ."
So that &apos;s how those imag@@ es were made .
( Applause ) Thank you .
"So , I have now showed you three pro@@ jec@@ ts , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?"
What &apos;s the idea be@@ h@@ ind it ?
I@@ s it just a wa@@ st@@ e of wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey ?
"Th@@ ose three pro@@ jec@@ ts , they &apos;re based on very simple scienti@@ fi@@ c ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a , such as magne@@ tis@@ m , the sound wa@@ ves , or over here , the phy@@ sical pro@@ per@@ ties of a sub@@ st@@ ance , and what I &apos;m trying to do is I &apos;m trying to use these ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a and show them in a po@@ e@@ tic and un@@ se@@ en way , and ther@@ e@@ fore inv@@ ite the vie@@ wer to pa@@ use for a moment and think about all the beau@@ ty that is con@@ st@@ an@@ tly sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding us ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"O@@ n@@ ce up@@ on a time , at the age of 2@@ 4 , I was a stud@@ ent at St@@ . Jo@@ h@@ n &apos;s M@@ e@@ di@@ cal C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in B@@ ang@@ al@@ ore ."
I was a gu@@ est stud@@ ent d@@ uring one mon@@ th of a publi@@ c health course .
And that chang@@ ed my min@@ d@@ set fore@@ ver .
"The course was good , but it was not the course cont@@ ent in itself that chang@@ ed the min@@ d@@ set ."
"It was the br@@ u@@ t@@ al re@@ alization , the first mor@@ ning , that the Indi@@ an students were better than me ."
"( Laughter ) You see , I was a study ner@@ d ."
I lo@@ ved st@@ ati@@ s@@ tics from a young age .
And I studi@@ ed very much in S@@ wed@@ en .
I used to be in the u@@ pp@@ er qu@@ ar@@ ter of all cour@@ ses I att@@ en@@ ded .
"But in St@@ . Jo@@ h@@ n &apos;s , I was in the lo@@ wer qu@@ ar@@ ter ."
And the fact was that Indi@@ an students studi@@ ed har@@ der than we did in S@@ wed@@ en .
"They read the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book tw@@ ice , or three times or four times ."
In S@@ wed@@ en we read it once and then we went par@@ t@@ ying .
"( L@@ au@@ gh@@ er ) And that , to me , that per@@ s@@ onal experience was the first time in my life that the min@@ d@@ set I gre@@ w up with was chang@@ ed ."
And I re@@ alized that perhaps the W@@ est@@ er@@ n world will not continu@@ e to dom@@ in@@ ate the world fore@@ ver .
And I think many of you have the same sort of per@@ s@@ onal experience .
It &apos;s that re@@ alization of someone you me@@ et that really made you change your ideas about the world .
"It &apos;s not the st@@ ati@@ s@@ tics , al@@ though I tried to make it fun@@ n@@ y ."
"And I will now , here , on@@ st@@ age , try to pre@@ di@@ ct when that will happen — that A@@ si@@ a will re@@ ga@@ in its dom@@ in@@ ant position as the lead@@ ing part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years ."
"And I will do that by trying to pre@@ di@@ ct preci@@ se@@ ly at what year the average income per person in India , in China , will re@@ ach that of the W@@ est ."
"And I don &apos;t mean the whole econom@@ y , because to grow an econom@@ y of India to the si@@ ze of U.@@ K@@ . — that &apos;s a piece of ca@@ ke , with one billion people ."
"But I want to see when will the average p@@ ay , the money for each person , per mon@@ th , in India and China , when will that have re@@ ach@@ ed that of U.@@ K@@ . and the United States ?"
But I will start with a hi@@ st@@ ori@@ cal bac@@ k@@ ground .
And you can see my ma@@ p if I get it up here . You know ?
I will start at 1858 .
1858 was a year of great techno@@ logical adv@@ an@@ ce@@ ment in the W@@ est .
"That was the year when Q@@ u@@ een V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ a was able , for the first time , to comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ te with P@@ re@@ si@@ dent B@@ u@@ chan@@ an , through the T@@ r@@ ans@@ at@@ lan@@ tic T@@ el@@ e@@ grap@@ hi@@ c C@@ able ."
And they were the first to &quot; &quot; T@@ wit@@ ter &quot; &quot; trans@@ at@@ lan@@ tic@@ ally .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;ve been able , through this wonderful Google and In@@ ter@@ net , to find the t@@ ex@@ t of the t@@ el@@ e@@ gra@@ m s@@ ent back from P@@ re@@ si@@ dent B@@ u@@ chan@@ an to Q@@ u@@ een V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ a ."
"And it ends like this : &quot; &quot; This t@@ el@@ e@@ grap@@ h is a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic in@@ str@@ ument to diff@@ use religi@@ on , ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , liber@@ ty and la@@ w thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the world . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose are n@@ ice words . But I got sort of cu@@ ri@@ ous of what he me@@ ant with liber@@ ty , and liber@@ ty for wh@@ om ."
And we will think about that when we look at the wi@@ der picture of the world in 1858 .
Because 1858 was also wat@@ er@@ shed year in the history of A@@ si@@ a .
1858 was the year when the cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous u@@ pri@@ sing against the fore@@ i@@ gn o@@ cc@@ up@@ ation of India was de@@ fe@@ ated by the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh for@@ ces .
And India was up to 8@@ 9 years more of fore@@ i@@ gn dom@@ in@@ ation .
1858 in China was the vic@@ t@@ ory in the O@@ pi@@ um War by the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh for@@ ces .
"And that me@@ ant that fore@@ i@@ gn@@ ers , as it said in the tre@@ at@@ y , were allowed to tra@@ de fre@@ ely in China ."
It me@@ ant pa@@ ying with op@@ i@@ um for Chin@@ ese go@@ o@@ ds .
And 1858 in Japan was the year when Japan had to si@@ gn the H@@ ar@@ r@@ is T@@ re@@ at@@ y and ac@@ cept tra@@ de on fa@@ v@@ or@@ able con@@ dition for the U.S@@ .
"And they were thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by those black shi@@ ps there , that had been in T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o har@@ b@@ or over the last year ."
"But , Japan , in con@@ tra@@ st to India and China , ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ined its national so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty ."
And let &apos;s see how much difference that can make .
"And I will do that by br@@ ing@@ ing these bub@@ b@@ les back to a G@@ ap@@ min@@ der grap@@ h here , where you can see each bub@@ ble is a country ."
The si@@ ze of the bub@@ ble here is the population .
"O@@ n this a@@ x@@ is , as I used to have income per person in com@@ par@@ able dol@@ lar ."
"And on that a@@ x@@ is I have life expe@@ c@@ t@@ anc@@ y , the health of people ."
And I also bring an in@@ no@@ v@@ ation here .
"I have trans@@ form@@ ed the la@@ s@@ er be@@ am into an ec@@ o@@ logical , rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able ver@@ sion here , in gre@@ en India ."
"( Applause ) And we will see , you know ."
"@@ L@@ ook here , 1858 , India was here , China was here , Japan was there , United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom was ri@@ ch@@ er over there ."
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
"A@@ c@@ tually if we go back into the hi@@ st@@ ori@@ cal rec@@ or@@ d , there was a time hund@@ re@@ ds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even ab@@ ove that of Eu@@ rop@@ e ."
"But 18@@ 50 had already been many , many years of fore@@ i@@ gn dom@@ in@@ ation , and India had been de@@ -@@ in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized ."
And you can see that the countries who were gro@@ wing their econom@@ y was United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom .
"And they were also , by the end of the century , getting heal@@ thy , and Japan was star@@ ting to cat@@ ch up ."
India was trying down here .
C@@ an you see how it star@@ ts to move there ?
"But really , really natural so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty was good for Japan ."
And Japan is trying to move up there .
"And it &apos;s the new century now . H@@ e@@ al@@ th is getting better , United K@@ ing@@ dom , United States ."
But car@@ e@@ ful now — we are appro@@ ach@@ ing the F@@ irst World War .
"And the F@@ irst World War , you know , we &apos;ll see a lot of de@@ a@@ ths and econom@@ i@@ cal problems here ."
United K@@ ing@@ dom is going down .
And now comes the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish fl@@ u also .
"And then after the F@@ irst World War , they continu@@ e up ."
"S@@ ti@@ ll under fore@@ i@@ gn dom@@ in@@ ation , and without so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty , India and China are down in the cor@@ ner ."
No@@ t much has happened .
They have gro@@ wn their population but not much more .
"In the 19@@ 30 &apos;s now , you can see that Japan is going to a peri@@ od of war , with lo@@ wer life expe@@ c@@ t@@ anc@@ y ."
"And the S@@ econ@@ d World War was really a ter@@ ri@@ ble ev@@ ent , also econom@@ ically for Japan ."
But they did re@@ co@@ ver quite fa@@ st af@@ ter@@ wards .
And we are mo@@ ving into the new world .
In 19@@ 4@@ 7 India fin@@ ally ga@@ ined its in@@ dep@@ end@@ ence .
"And they could ra@@ ise the Indi@@ an f@@ la@@ g and become a so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn n@@ ation , but in very big diffic@@ ul@@ ties down there ."
( Applause ) In 19@@ 4@@ 9 we saw the e@@ mer@@ g@@ ence of the modern China in a way which surpri@@ sed the world .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after in@@ dep@@ end@@ ence ?
You can see that the health started to impro@@ ve .
Ch@@ ildren started to go to school .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th ser@@ vic@@ es were pro@@ vi@@ ded .
"This is the G@@ re@@ at L@@ ea@@ p F@@ or@@ ward , when China f@@ ell down ."
It was cen@@ tr@@ al plan@@ ning by Ma@@ o T@@ se T@@ un@@ g .
"@@ China re@@ co@@ ver@@ ed . Th@@ en they said , &quot; Ne@@ ver@@ more , stu@@ p@@ id cen@@ tr@@ al plan@@ ning . &quot;"
"But they went up here , and India was trying to fol@@ low ."
And they were cat@@ ching up in@@ de@@ ed .
"And both countries had the better health , but still a very low econom@@ y ."
"And we came to 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and Ma@@ o T@@ se T@@ un@@ g di@@ ed , and a new guy turned up from the left ."
And it was D@@ en@@ g X@@ i@@ a@@ op@@ ing coming out here .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t matter if a c@@ at is wh@@ ite or black , as long as it cat@@ ch@@ es m@@ ice . &quot; &quot; Because cat@@ ching m@@ ice is what the two ca@@ ts wanted to do ."
"And you can see the two ca@@ ts being here , China and India , wan@@ ting to cat@@ ch the mic@@ es over there , you know ."
"And they decided to go not only for health and education , but also star@@ ting to grow their econom@@ y ."
And the mark@@ et re@@ form@@ er was success@@ ful there .
In &apos; 9@@ 2 India fol@@ lo@@ ws with a mark@@ et re@@ form .
"And they go quite cl@@ os@@ ely together , and you can see that the si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ity with India and China , in many ways , are gre@@ ater than the differ@@ ences with them ."
And here they mar@@ ch on . And will they cat@@ ch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Now what does it mean that the — ( Applause ) the a@@ ver@@ ag@@ es there — this is the average of China .
"If I would sp@@ li@@ t China , look here , S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i has already cat@@ ched up ."
S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i is already there .
And it &apos;s heal@@ th@@ i@@ er than the United States .
"But on the other hand , G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou , one of the p@@ oo@@ rest in@@ land pro@@ v@@ in@@ ces of China , is there ."
"And if I sp@@ li@@ t G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou into ur@@ b@@ an and r@@ ur@@ al , the r@@ ur@@ al part of G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou goes down there ."
"You see this en@@ orm@@ ous inequ@@ ity in China , in the mi@@ d@@ st of fa@@ st economic growth ."
"And if I would also look at India , you have another t@@ yp@@ e of inequ@@ ity , actually , in India ."
"The ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ cal , m@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ cal difference is not so big ."
"@@ U@@ t@@ ta@@ r P@@ ra@@ de@@ sh , the big@@ gest of the st@@ ates here , is p@@ oo@@ re@@ r and has a lo@@ wer health than the rest of India ."
"@@ K@@ er@@ al@@ a is fl@@ ying on top there , mat@@ ching United States in health , but not in econom@@ y ."
"And here , Ma@@ har@@ a@@ sh@@ tra , with M@@ um@@ ba@@ i , is for@@ g@@ ing for@@ ward ."
"Now in India , the big inequ@@ i@@ ties are within the state , rather than between the st@@ ates ."
"And that is not a bad thing , in itself ."
"If you have a lot inequ@@ ity , m@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ cal inequ@@ i@@ ties can be more difficult in the long ter@@ m to de@@ al with , than if it is in the same are@@ a where you have a growth cen@@ ter rela@@ tively cl@@ ose to where poor people are li@@ ving ."
"@@ No , there is one more inequ@@ ity . L@@ ook there , United States ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , they bro@@ ke my f@@ ra@@ me ."
"@@ W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . went out here ."
M@@ y fri@@ ends at G@@ ap@@ min@@ der wanted me to show this because there is a new lead@@ er in W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton who is really con@@ cer@@ ned about the health system .
"And I can understand him , because W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ ."
is so rich over there but they are not as heal@@ thy as K@@ er@@ al@@ a .
"It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?"
"( Applause ) I can see a b@@ usiness op@@ p@@ ort@@ unity for K@@ er@@ al@@ a , hel@@ p@@ ing fi@@ x the health system in the United States ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now here we have the whole world . You have the le@@ g@@ end down there .
"And when you see the two gi@@ ant ca@@ ts here , pu@@ shing for@@ ward , you see that in between them and a@@ head of them , is the whole e@@ mer@@ g@@ ing econom@@ ies of the world , which Th@@ om@@ as F@@ ri@@ ed@@ man so cor@@ rec@@ tly called the &quot; &quot; fl@@ at world . &quot; &quot; You can see that in health and education , a lar@@ ge part of the world population is pu@@ tting for@@ ward , but in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , and other parts , as in r@@ ur@@ al G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou in China , there is still people with low health and very low econom@@ y ."
We have an en@@ orm@@ ous dis@@ par@@ ity in the world .
But most of the world in the mi@@ ddle are pu@@ shing for@@ wards very fa@@ st .
"Now , back to my pro@@ jec@@ tions ."
Wh@@ en will it cat@@ ch up ? I have to go back to very con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal grap@@ h .
"I will show income per person on this a@@ x@@ is instead , poor down here , rich up there ."
"And then time here , from 1858 I start the world ."
And we sh@@ all see what will happen with these countries .
"You see , China under fore@@ i@@ gn dom@@ in@@ ation actually lo@@ wer@@ ed their income and came down to the Indi@@ an level here ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as U.@@ K@@ . and United States is getting ri@@ ch@@ er and ri@@ ch@@ er .
"And after S@@ econ@@ d World War , United States is ri@@ ch@@ er than U.@@ K@@ ."
But in@@ dep@@ end@@ ence is coming here .
"@@ G@@ ro@@ wth is star@@ ting , economic re@@ form ."
"@@ G@@ ro@@ wth is fa@@ ster , and with pro@@ jec@@ tion from I@@ M@@ F you can see where you expe@@ ct them to be in 20@@ 14 ."
"Now , the question is , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en will the cat@@ ch up take place ? &quot; &quot; L@@ ook at , look at the United States ."
C@@ an you see the bub@@ ble ?
"The bub@@ b@@ les , not my bub@@ b@@ les , but the fin@@ an@@ cial bub@@ b@@ les ."
That &apos;s the do@@ t co@@ m bub@@ ble . This is the L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers do@@ or@@ ste@@ p there .
You see it came down there .
"And it seems this is another ro@@ ck coming down there , you know ."
"So they doesn &apos;t seem to go this way , these countries ."
"They seem to go in a more hum@@ ble growth way , you know ."
And people interest@@ ed in growth are tur@@ ning their ey@@ es to@@ wards A@@ si@@ a .
I can comp@@ are to Japan . This is Japan coming up .
"You see , Japan did it like that ."
We ad@@ d Japan to it .
And there is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that fa@@ st cat@@ ch up can take place .
C@@ an you see here what Japan did ?
"@@ Japan did it like this , until ful@@ l cat@@ ch up , and then they fol@@ low with the other high@@ -@@ income econom@@ ies ."
"But the real pro@@ jec@@ tions for those ones , I would like to give it like this ."
"C@@ an be worse , can be better ."
"It &apos;s always difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally about the future ."
"Now , a hi@@ st@@ ori@@ an t@@ ells me it &apos;s even more difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct about the past ."
( Laughter ) I think I &apos;m in a difficult position here .
"I@@ ne@@ qu@@ ali@@ ties in China and India I con@@ si@@ der really the big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le because to bring the enti@@ re population into growth and pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity is what will create a domestic mark@@ et , what will a@@ vo@@ id social inst@@ ab@@ i@@ lity , and which will make use of the enti@@ re cap@@ ac@@ ity of the population ."
"So , social in@@ ve@@ st@@ ments in health , education and in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture , and electri@@ c@@ ity is really what is needed in India and China ."
"You know the c@@ lim@@ ate . We have great inter@@ national ex@@ per@@ ts within India t@@ elling us that the c@@ lim@@ ate is chang@@ ing , and ac@@ tions has to be taken , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se China and India would be the countries most to suff@@ er from c@@ lim@@ ate change ."
And I con@@ si@@ der India and China the best par@@ t@@ n@@ ers in the world in a good global c@@ lim@@ ate poli@@ c@@ y .
"But they a@@ in &apos;t going to p@@ ay for what others , who have more money , have lar@@ ge@@ ly cre@@ ated , and I can ag@@ ree on that ."
But what I &apos;m really wor@@ ri@@ ed about is war .
"@@ W@@ ill the form@@ er rich countries really ac@@ cept a comple@@ tely chang@@ ed world econom@@ y , and a shi@@ ft of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years , back to A@@ si@@ a ?"
"And will A@@ si@@ a be able to h@@ and@@ le that new position of being in char@@ ge of being the most mi@@ gh@@ ty , and the govern@@ ors of the world ?"
"So , always a@@ vo@@ id war , because that always pu@@ sh@@ es human be@@ ings bac@@ k@@ ward ."
"Now if these inequ@@ ali@@ ties , c@@ lim@@ ate and war can be a@@ vo@@ i@@ ded , get ready for a world in equ@@ ity , because this is what seems to be happening ."
"And that vi@@ sion that I got as a young stud@@ ent , 19@@ 7@@ 2 , that Indi@@ ans can be much better than S@@ wed@@ es , is just about to happen ."
"And it will happen preci@@ se@@ ly the year 20@@ 4@@ 8 in the later part of the su@@ mm@@ er , in J@@ u@@ ly , more preci@@ se@@ ly , the 2@@ 7@@ th of J@@ u@@ ly ."
"( Applause ) The 2@@ 7@@ th of J@@ u@@ ly , 20@@ 4@@ 8 is my 1@@ 00@@ th b@@ ir@@ th@@ day ."
( Laughter ) And I expe@@ ct to spea@@ k in the first se@@ s@@ sion of the 3@@ 9@@ th TED India .
G@@ et your b@@ oo@@ k@@ ings in time . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"H@@ i . So , this c@@ ha@@ p here , he thin@@ ks he can tell you the future ."
"H@@ is na@@ me is N@@ os@@ tra@@ d@@ am@@ us , al@@ though here the Sun have made him look a little bit like S@@ e@@ an Con@@ n@@ ery . ( Laughter ) And like most of you , I su@@ spe@@ ct , I don &apos;t really believe that people can see into the future ."
"I don &apos;t believe in pre@@ cogn@@ ition , and every now and then , you hear that somebody has been able to pre@@ di@@ ct something that happened in the future , and that &apos;s probably because it was a flu@@ ke , and we only hear about the flu@@ kes and about the f@@ rea@@ ks ."
We don &apos;t hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong .
"Now we expe@@ ct that to happen with si@@ l@@ ly stories about pre@@ cogn@@ ition , but the problem is , we have ex@@ actly the same problem in a@@ ca@@ de@@ mi@@ a and in medicine , and in this environ@@ ment , it cos@@ ts lives ."
"So fir@@ st@@ ly , thinking just about pre@@ cogn@@ ition , as it turns out , just last year a resear@@ ch@@ er called D@@ ar@@ y@@ l Be@@ m conduc@@ ted a piece of resear@@ ch where he found evi@@ dence of pre@@ cogn@@ itive po@@ w@@ ers in under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate students , and this was published in a pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic j@@ ourn@@ al and most of the people who read this just said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , well , fa@@ ir enough , but I think that &apos;s a flu@@ ke , that &apos;s a f@@ rea@@ k , because I know that if I did a study where I found no evi@@ dence that under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate students had pre@@ cogn@@ itive po@@ w@@ ers , it probably wouldn &apos;t get published in a j@@ ourn@@ al ."
"And in fact , we know that that &apos;s true , because se@@ ver@@ al different groups of resear@@ ch scienti@@ sts tried to rep@@ lica@@ te the fin@@ d@@ ings of this pre@@ cogn@@ ition study , and when they sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted it to the ex@@ act same j@@ ourn@@ al , the j@@ ourn@@ al said , &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;re not interest@@ ed in publi@@ shing rep@@ li@@ cation . We &apos;re not interest@@ ed in your ne@@ g@@ ative data . &quot; &quot; So this is already evi@@ dence of how , in the a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic liter@@ ature , we will see a bi@@ as@@ ed sa@@ mple of the true picture of all of the scienti@@ fi@@ c studies that have been conduc@@ ted ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the d@@ ry a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic field of psycho@@ logy .
"It also happens in , for example , c@@ anc@@ er resear@@ ch ."
"So in M@@ ar@@ ch , 20@@ 12 , just one mon@@ th ago , some resear@@ ch@@ ers rep@@ or@@ ted in the j@@ ourn@@ al N@@ ature how they had tried to rep@@ lica@@ te 5@@ 3 different ba@@ sic science studies looking at p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al tre@@ at@@ ment t@@ ar@@ gets in c@@ anc@@ er , and out of those 5@@ 3 studies , they were only able to success@@ fully rep@@ lica@@ te six ."
F@@ ort@@ y-@@ se@@ ven out of those 5@@ 3 were un@@ rep@@ lica@@ ble .
And they say in their di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion that this is very li@@ ke@@ ly because f@@ rea@@ ks get published .
"@@ Pe@@ ople will do lots and lots and lots of different studies , and the o@@ c@@ ca@@ sions when it works they will publi@@ sh , and the ones where it doesn &apos;t work they won &apos;t ."
"And their first re@@ com@@ men@@ d@@ ation of how to fi@@ x this problem , because it is a problem , because it sen@@ ds us all down bl@@ ind al@@ le@@ ys , their first re@@ com@@ men@@ d@@ ation of how to fi@@ x this problem is to make it ea@@ si@@ er to publi@@ sh ne@@ g@@ ative results in science , and to change the in@@ c@@ enti@@ ves so that scienti@@ sts are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to p@@ ost more of their ne@@ g@@ ative results in publi@@ c ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the very d@@ ry world of pre@@ cl@@ ini@@ cal ba@@ sic science c@@ anc@@ er resear@@ ch .
"It also happens in the very real , f@@ le@@ sh and b@@ loo@@ d of a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic medicine . So in 19@@ 80 , some resear@@ ch@@ ers did a study on a dru@@ g called l@@ or@@ ca@@ ini@@ de , and this was an an@@ ti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic dru@@ g , a dru@@ g that su@@ p@@ press@@ es ab@@ n@@ orm@@ al heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , and the idea was , after people have had a heart att@@ ack , they &apos;re quite li@@ ke@@ ly to have ab@@ n@@ orm@@ al heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , so if we give them a dru@@ g that su@@ p@@ press@@ es ab@@ n@@ orm@@ al heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , this will increase the chan@@ ces of them survi@@ ving ."
"@@ Ear@@ ly on its develop@@ ment , they did a very small tri@@ al , just under a hundred patients ."
"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty patients got l@@ or@@ ca@@ ini@@ de , and of those patients , 10 di@@ ed ."
"A@@ no@@ ther 50 patients got a d@@ um@@ my pl@@ ace@@ b@@ o sug@@ ar p@@ ill with no ac@@ tive in@@ gre@@ di@@ ent , and only one of them di@@ ed ."
"So they ri@@ gh@@ tly re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded this dru@@ g as a fa@@ il@@ ure , and its com@@ mer@@ cial develop@@ ment was st@@ op@@ p@@ ed , and because its com@@ mer@@ cial develop@@ ment was st@@ op@@ p@@ ed , this tri@@ al was never published ."
"@@ Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately , over the course of the next five , 10 years , other comp@@ an@@ ies had the same idea about dru@@ gs that would pre@@ v@@ ent ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ as in people who have had heart att@@ ac@@ ks ."
"Th@@ ese dru@@ gs were br@@ ought to mark@@ et . They were pre@@ scri@@ b@@ ed very w@@ ide@@ ly because heart att@@ ac@@ ks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these dru@@ gs also ca@@ used an increas@@ ed r@@ ate of de@@ ath that before we de@@ te@@ c@@ ted that sa@@ fe@@ ty sign@@ al , over 1@@ 00@@ ,000 people di@@ ed un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly in America from the pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tion of an@@ ti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic dru@@ gs ."
"Now actually , in 19@@ 9@@ 3 , the resear@@ ch@@ ers who did that 19@@ 80 study , that early study , published a me@@ a cul@@ p@@ a , an ap@@ o@@ logy to the scienti@@ fi@@ c comm@@ unity , in which they said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en we car@@ ri@@ ed out our study in 19@@ 80 , we thought that the increas@@ ed de@@ ath r@@ ate that o@@ cc@@ ur@@ red in the l@@ or@@ ca@@ ini@@ de group was an effec@@ t of chan@@ ce . &quot; &quot; The develop@@ ment of l@@ or@@ ca@@ ini@@ de was ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed for com@@ mer@@ cial reas@@ ons , and this study was never published ; it &apos;s now a good example of publi@@ cation bi@@ as ."
"That &apos;s the tech@@ ni@@ cal ter@@ m for the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on where un@@ fl@@ at@@ ter@@ ing data gets l@@ ost , gets un@@ published , is left mi@@ ss@@ ing in action , and they say the results describ@@ ed here &quot; might have pro@@ vi@@ ded an early war@@ ning of tr@@ ou@@ ble a@@ head . &quot;"
Now these are stories from ba@@ sic science .
"Th@@ ese are stories from 20 , 30 years ago ."
The a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic publi@@ shing environ@@ ment is very different now .
"There are a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic j@@ ourn@@ als like &quot; &quot; T@@ ri@@ als , &quot; &quot; the op@@ en acc@@ ess j@@ ourn@@ al , which will publi@@ sh any tri@@ al conduc@@ ted in hum@@ ans re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of whether it has a pos@@ itive or a ne@@ g@@ ative resul@@ t ."
But this problem of ne@@ g@@ ative results that go mi@@ ss@@ ing in action is still very pre@@ v@@ al@@ ent . In fact it &apos;s so pre@@ v@@ al@@ ent that it cu@@ ts to the c@@ ore of evi@@ d@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ based medicine .
"So this is a dru@@ g called re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine , and this is a dru@@ g that I my@@ self have pre@@ scri@@ b@@ ed . It &apos;s an an@@ ti@@ de@@ press@@ ant ."
"And I &apos;m a very ner@@ dy doc@@ tor , so I read all of the studies that I could on this dru@@ g . I read the one study that was published that showed that re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine was better than pl@@ ace@@ b@@ o , and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine was just as good as any other an@@ ti@@ de@@ press@@ ant , and because this pati@@ ent ha@@ dn &apos;t done well on those other an@@ ti@@ de@@ press@@ an@@ ts , I thought , well , re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine is just as good . It &apos;s one to try ."
"But it turned out that I was mis@@ led . In fact , se@@ ven trials were conduc@@ ted com@@ par@@ ing re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine against a d@@ um@@ my pl@@ ace@@ b@@ o sug@@ ar p@@ ill . One of them was pos@@ itive and that was published , but six of them were ne@@ g@@ ative and they were left un@@ published ."
"Th@@ ree trials were published com@@ par@@ ing re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine against other an@@ ti@@ de@@ press@@ an@@ ts in which re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine was just as good , and they were published , but three times as many patients &apos; wor@@ th of data was col@@ lec@@ ted which showed that re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine was worse than those other tre@@ at@@ ments , and those trials were not published ."
I f@@ el@@ t mis@@ led .
"Now you might say , well , that &apos;s an extre@@ me@@ ly un@@ u@@ su@@ al example , and I wouldn &apos;t want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of the same kind of ch@@ er@@ r@@ y-@@ pic@@ king and sel@@ ec@@ tive re@@ fer@@ enc@@ ing that I &apos;m acc@@ using other people of ."
"But it turns out that this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on of publi@@ cation bi@@ as has actually been very , very well studi@@ ed ."
So here is one example of how you appro@@ ach it .
"The cla@@ s@@ sic mo@@ de@@ l is , you get a b@@ un@@ ch of studies where you know that they &apos;ve been conduc@@ ted and comple@@ ted , and then you go and see if they &apos;ve been published any@@ where in the a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic liter@@ ature . So this took all of the trials that had ever been conduc@@ ted on an@@ ti@@ de@@ press@@ an@@ ts that were appro@@ ved over a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ year peri@@ od by the F@@ D@@ A ."
They took all of the trials which were sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted to the F@@ D@@ A as part of the appro@@ val p@@ ac@@ k@@ age .
"So that &apos;s not all of the trials that were ever conduc@@ ted on these dru@@ gs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conduc@@ ted in order to get the marke@@ ting au@@ th@@ or@@ iz@@ ation ."
And then they went to see if these trials had been published in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic liter@@ ature . And this is what they found .
"It was pretty much a 5@@ 0@@ -@@ 50 sp@@ li@@ t . H@@ al@@ f of these trials were pos@@ itive , half of them were ne@@ g@@ ative , in reality ."
"But when they went to look for these trials in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic liter@@ ature , what they found was a very different picture ."
"O@@ n@@ ly three of the ne@@ g@@ ative trials were published , but all but one of the pos@@ itive trials were published ."
"Now if we just f@@ li@@ ck back and for@@ th between those two , you can see what a st@@ ag@@ g@@ ering difference there was between reality and what doc@@ tors , patients , com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ers of health ser@@ vic@@ es , and a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic@@ s were able to see in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic liter@@ ature ."
"We were mis@@ led , and this is a syste@@ ma@@ tic f@@ la@@ w in the c@@ ore of medicine ."
"In fact , there have been so many studies conduc@@ ted on publi@@ cation bi@@ as now , over a hundred , that they &apos;ve been col@@ lec@@ ted in a syste@@ ma@@ tic re@@ view , published in 20@@ 10 , that took every single study on publi@@ cation bi@@ as that they could find ."
P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ cation bi@@ as a@@ ffec@@ ts every field of medicine .
"A@@ b@@ out half of all trials , on average , go mi@@ ss@@ ing in action , and we know that pos@@ itive fin@@ d@@ ings are around tw@@ ice as li@@ ke@@ ly to be published as ne@@ g@@ ative fin@@ d@@ ings ."
This is a c@@ anc@@ er at the c@@ ore of evi@@ d@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ based medicine .
"If I f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed a co@@ in 100 times but then with@@ hel@@ d the results from you from half of those t@@ os@@ ses , I could make it look as if I had a co@@ in that always came up he@@ a@@ ds ."
But that wouldn &apos;t mean that I had a tw@@ o@@ -@@ he@@ ad@@ ed co@@ in .
That would mean that I was a chan@@ c@@ er and you were an i@@ di@@ o@@ t for le@@ tting me get away with it . ( Laughter ) But this is ex@@ actly what we bl@@ in@@ dly t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate in the whole of evi@@ d@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ based medicine .
"And to me , this is resear@@ ch mis@@ conduc@@ t ."
"If I conduc@@ ted one study and I with@@ hel@@ d half of the data poin@@ ts from that one study , you would ri@@ gh@@ tly acc@@ use me , essenti@@ ally , of resear@@ ch f@@ ra@@ u@@ d ."
"And yet , for some reason , if somebody conduc@@ ts 10 studies but only publi@@ sh@@ es the five that give the resul@@ t that they want , we don &apos;t con@@ si@@ der that to be resear@@ ch mis@@ conduc@@ t ."
"And when that respon@@ sibi@@ lity is diff@@ used between a whole ne@@ t@@ work of resear@@ ch@@ ers , a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic@@ s , in@@ du@@ str@@ y spon@@ s@@ ors , j@@ ourn@@ al ed@@ it@@ ors , for some reason we find it more ac@@ cep@@ table , but the effec@@ t on patients is d@@ am@@ ning ."
"And this is happening right now , today ."
"This is a dru@@ g called T@@ a@@ mi@@ fl@@ u . T@@ a@@ mi@@ fl@@ u is a dru@@ g which govern@@ ments around the world have sp@@ ent b@@ illions and b@@ illions of dollars on sto@@ c@@ k@@ p@@ il@@ ing , and we &apos;ve sto@@ c@@ k@@ p@@ il@@ ed T@@ a@@ mi@@ fl@@ u in p@@ an@@ ic , in the belie@@ f that it will re@@ duce the r@@ ate of comp@@ lica@@ tions of in@@ flu@@ en@@ z@@ a ."
"C@@ om@@ p@@ lica@@ tions is a medi@@ cal e@@ up@@ he@@ mis@@ m for p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia and de@@ ath . ( Laughter ) Now when the C@@ o@@ ch@@ ran@@ e syste@@ ma@@ tic re@@ vie@@ w@@ ers were trying to colle@@ ct together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been conduc@@ ted on whether T@@ a@@ mi@@ fl@@ u actually did this or not , they found that se@@ ver@@ al of those trials were un@@ published ."
The results were un@@ a@@ va@@ il@@ able to them .
"And when they started ob@@ ta@@ ining the wr@@ it@@ e@@ u@@ ps of those trials through v@@ ari@@ ous different means , through F@@ re@@ e@@ dom of In@@ formation A@@ ct re@@ qu@@ est@@ s , through har@@ as@@ sing v@@ ari@@ ous different organiz@@ ations , what they found was in@@ con@@ sist@@ ent ."
"And when they tried to get a hold of the cl@@ ini@@ cal study rep@@ orts , the 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ age long doc@@ um@@ ents that have the best possible r@@ en@@ dition of the information , they were told they wer@@ en &apos;t allowed to have them ."
"And if you want to read the ful@@ l cor@@ respon@@ dence and the exc@@ us@@ es and the ex@@ plan@@ ations gi@@ ven by the dru@@ g comp@@ any , you can see that wr@@ it@@ ten up in this wee@@ k &apos;s e@@ dition of P@@ L@@ O@@ S M@@ e@@ dicine ."
"And the most st@@ ag@@ g@@ ering thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recogn@@ ize that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suff@@ er fa@@ ke fi@@ x@@ es ."
We &apos;ve had people pre@@ t@@ end that this is a problem that &apos;s been fi@@ x@@ ed .
"F@@ irst of all , we had trials re@@ gi@@ st@@ ers , and everybody said , o@@ h , it &apos;s o@@ kay . We &apos;ll get everyone to re@@ gi@@ ster their trials , they &apos;ll p@@ ost the pr@@ ot@@ o@@ co@@ l , they &apos;ll say what they &apos;re going to do before they do it , and then af@@ ter@@ wards we &apos;ll be able to ch@@ ec@@ k and see if all the trials which have been conduc@@ ted and comple@@ ted have been published ."
But people didn &apos;t b@@ other to use those re@@ gi@@ st@@ ers .
"And so then the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ om@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ e of M@@ e@@ di@@ cal J@@ ourn@@ al E@@ d@@ it@@ ors came along , and they said , o@@ h , well , we will hold the l@@ ine ."
"We won &apos;t publi@@ sh any j@@ ourn@@ als , we won &apos;t publi@@ sh any trials , un@@ less they &apos;ve been re@@ gi@@ ster@@ ed before they beg@@ an ."
"But they didn &apos;t hold the l@@ ine . In 200@@ 8 , a study was conduc@@ ted which showed that half of all of trials published by j@@ ourn@@ als ed@@ ited by mem@@ bers of the I@@ C@@ M@@ J@@ E wer@@ en &apos;t pro@@ per@@ ly re@@ gi@@ ster@@ ed , and a qu@@ ar@@ ter of them wer@@ en &apos;t re@@ gi@@ ster@@ ed at all ."
"And then fin@@ ally , the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ ct was pas@@ sed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conduc@@ ts a tri@@ al must p@@ ost the results of that tri@@ al within one year ."
"And in the B@@ M@@ J , in the first e@@ dition of J@@ an@@ u@@ ary , 20@@ 12 , you can see a study which looks to see if people ke@@ p@@ t to that r@@ ul@@ ing , and it turns out that only one in five have done so ."
This is a di@@ sa@@ ster .
We cannot know the true effec@@ ts of the me@@ dic@@ ines that we pre@@ scri@@ be if we do not have acc@@ ess to all of the information .
And this is not a difficult problem to fi@@ x .
"We need to force people to publi@@ sh all trials conduc@@ ted in hum@@ ans , in@@ clu@@ ding the ol@@ der trials , because the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ ct only as@@ ks that you publi@@ sh the trials conduc@@ ted after 200@@ 8 , and I don &apos;t know what world it is in which we &apos;re only pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing medicine on the bas@@ is of trials that comple@@ ted in the past two years ."
"We need to publi@@ sh all trials in hum@@ ans , in@@ clu@@ ding the ol@@ der trials , for all dru@@ gs in cur@@ r@@ ent use , and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fi@@ x@@ ed ."
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
P@@ ul@@ l the k@@ not .
The ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on you saw here for a bri@@ e@@ f moment is called quantum le@@ vit@@ ation and quantum loc@@ king .
And the ob@@ ject that was le@@ vit@@ ating here is called a superconductor .
"S@@ u@@ per@@ conduc@@ ti@@ vity is a quantum state of matter , and it o@@ cc@@ ur@@ s only be@@ low a certain cri@@ tical te@@ m@@ per@@ ature ."
"Now , it &apos;s quite an old ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on ; it was disco@@ ver@@ ed 100 years ago ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , only rec@@ ently , du@@ e to se@@ ver@@ al techno@@ logical adv@@ an@@ ce@@ ments , we are now able to de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate to you quantum le@@ vit@@ ation and quantum loc@@ king ."
"So , a superconductor is defin@@ ed by two pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"The first is z@@ er@@ o electri@@ cal re@@ sist@@ ance , and the second is the exp@@ ul@@ sion of a magnetic field from the inter@@ i@@ or of the superconductor ."
"That s@@ oun@@ ds comp@@ lica@@ ted , right ?"
But what is electri@@ cal re@@ sist@@ ance ?
"So , electri@@ c@@ ity is the f@@ low of electr@@ ons inside a material ."
"And these electr@@ ons , while f@@ lo@@ wing , they col@@ li@@ de with the at@@ oms , and in these col@@ li@@ sions they l@@ ose a certain amount of energy ."
"And they dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate this energy in the form of he@@ at , and you know that effec@@ t ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , inside a superconductor there are no col@@ li@@ sions , so there is no energy dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation ."
It &apos;s quite re@@ mark@@ able . Th@@ ink about it .
"In cla@@ s@@ sical physics , there is always some fri@@ c@@ tion , some energy l@@ os@@ s ."
"But not here , because it is a quantum effec@@ t ."
"But that &apos;s not all , because superconduc@@ tors don &apos;t like magnetic fiel@@ ds ."
"So a superconductor will try to expe@@ l magnetic field from the inside , and it has the means to do that by cir@@ cul@@ ating cur@@ r@@ ents ."
"Now , the com@@ b@@ in@@ ation of both effec@@ ts — the exp@@ ul@@ sion of magnetic fiel@@ ds and z@@ er@@ o electri@@ cal re@@ sist@@ ance — is ex@@ actly a superconductor ."
"But the picture isn &apos;t always per@@ fe@@ ct , as we all know , and some@@ times str@@ ands of magnetic field re@@ ma@@ in inside the superconductor ."
"Now , under pro@@ per con@@ di@@ tions , which we have here , these str@@ ands of magnetic field can be tr@@ app@@ ed inside the superconductor ."
"And these str@@ ands of magnetic field inside the superconductor , they come in dis@@ cre@@ te quan@@ ti@@ ties ."
Why ? Because it is a quantum ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on . It &apos;s quantum physics .
And it turns out that they be@@ have like quantum particles .
"In this mo@@ vi@@ e here , you can see how they f@@ low one by one dis@@ cre@@ tely ."
"This is str@@ ands of magnetic field . These are not particles , but they be@@ have like particles ."
"So , this is why we call this effec@@ t quantum le@@ vit@@ ation and quantum loc@@ king ."
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field ?
"Well , first there are str@@ ands of magnetic field left inside , but now the superconductor doesn &apos;t like them mo@@ ving around , because their move@@ ments dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate energy , which brea@@ ks the superconduc@@ ti@@ vity state ."
"So what it actually does , it loc@@ ks these str@@ ands , which are called flu@@ x@@ ons , and it loc@@ ks these flu@@ x@@ ons in place ."
"And by doing that , what it actually does is loc@@ king itself in place ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because any move@@ ment of the superconductor will change their place , will change their con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation ."
So we get quantum loc@@ king . And let me show you how this works .
"I have here a superconductor , which I wr@@ app@@ ed up so it &apos;d st@@ ay co@@ ld long enough ."
"And when I place it on top of a re@@ gu@@ lar magne@@ t , it just sta@@ ys loc@@ ked in mi@@ da@@ ir ."
"( Applause ) Now , this is not just le@@ vit@@ ation . It &apos;s not just rep@@ ul@@ sion ."
"I can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the flu@@ x@@ ons , and it will be loc@@ ked in this new con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke this , or move it sli@@ gh@@ tly to the right or to the left ."
"So , this is quantum loc@@ king — actually loc@@ king — thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal loc@@ king of the superconductor ."
"O@@ f course , I can turn it up@@ side down , and it will re@@ ma@@ in loc@@ ked ."
"Now , now that we understand that this so@@ -@@ called le@@ vit@@ ation is actually loc@@ king , Y@@ ea@@ h , we understand that ."
"You won &apos;t be surpri@@ sed to hear that if I take this circ@@ ular magne@@ t , in which the magnetic field is the same all around , the superconductor will be able to fre@@ ely r@@ ot@@ ate around the a@@ x@@ is of the magne@@ t ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because as long as it r@@ ot@@ ates , the loc@@ king is ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ined ."
You see ? I can ad@@ just and I can r@@ ot@@ ate the superconductor .
"We have fri@@ c@@ tion@@ less mo@@ tion . It is still le@@ vit@@ ating , but can move fre@@ ely all around ."
"So , we have quantum loc@@ king and we can le@@ vit@@ ate it on top of this magne@@ t ."
"But how many flu@@ x@@ ons , how many magnetic str@@ ands are there in a single dis@@ k like this ?"
"Well , we can cal@@ cul@@ ate it , and it turns out , quite a lot ."
One hundred billion str@@ ands of magnetic field inside this thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch dis@@ k .
"But that &apos;s not the a@@ ma@@ zing part yet , because there is something I ha@@ ven &apos;t told you yet ."
"And , ye@@ a@@ h , the a@@ ma@@ zing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a mic@@ r@@ on th@@ ic@@ k . It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly th@@ in ."
"And this extre@@ me@@ ly th@@ in lay@@ er is able to le@@ vit@@ ate more than 7@@ 0,000 times its own we@@ ight ."
It &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ able effec@@ t . It &apos;s very strong .
"Now , I can ex@@ t@@ end this circ@@ ular magne@@ t , and make wh@@ at@@ ever tr@@ ack I want ."
"For example , I can make a lar@@ ge circ@@ ular ra@@ il here ."
"And when I place the superconduc@@ ting dis@@ k on top of this ra@@ il , it mo@@ ves fre@@ ely ."
"( Applause ) And again , that &apos;s not all . I can ad@@ just its position like this , and r@@ ot@@ ate , and it fre@@ ely mo@@ ves in this new position ."
And I can even try a new thing ; let &apos;s try it for the first time .
"I can take this dis@@ k and put it here , and while it sta@@ ys here — don &apos;t move — I will try to r@@ ot@@ ate the tr@@ ack , and hop@@ e@@ fully , if I did it cor@@ rec@@ tly , it sta@@ ys su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded ."
"( Applause ) You see , it &apos;s quantum loc@@ king , not le@@ vit@@ ation ."
"Now , while I &apos;ll let it cir@@ cul@@ ate for a little more , let me tell you a little bit about superconduc@@ tors ."
"Now — ( Laughter ) — So we now know that we are able to trans@@ f@@ er en@@ orm@@ ous amount of cur@@ r@@ ents inside superconduc@@ tors , so we can use them to pro@@ duce strong magnetic fiel@@ ds , such as needed in M@@ R@@ I mach@@ ines , partic@@ le acc@@ el@@ er@@ at@@ ors and so on ."
"But we can also st@@ ore energy using superconduc@@ tors , because we have no dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation ."
"And we could also pro@@ duce power ca@@ b@@ les , to trans@@ f@@ er en@@ orm@@ ous amoun@@ ts of cur@@ r@@ ent between power st@@ ations ."
I@@ mag@@ ine you could back up a single power st@@ ation with a single superconduc@@ ting ca@@ ble .
But what is the future of quantum le@@ vit@@ ation and quantum loc@@ king ?
"Well , let me answer this simple question by giving you an example ."
"I@@ mag@@ ine you would have a dis@@ k si@@ mil@@ ar to the one I have here in my hand , thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch di@@ a@@ me@@ ter , with a single difference ."
"The superconduc@@ ting lay@@ er , instead of being half a mic@@ r@@ on th@@ in , being two m@@ illi@@ me@@ ters th@@ in , quite th@@ in ."
"This tw@@ o@@ -@@ m@@ illi@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ th@@ in superconduc@@ ting lay@@ er could hold 1@@ ,000 k@@ il@@ o@@ gra@@ ms , a small ca@@ r , in my hand ."
A@@ ma@@ zing . Thank you .

"I &apos;m here today to talk about a dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing question , which has an equ@@ ally dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing answer ."
"M@@ y t@@ op@@ ic is the se@@ cre@@ ts of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le is the one question everyone always as@@ ks : Why does she st@@ ay ?"
Why would any@@ one st@@ ay with a man who be@@ at@@ s her ?
"I &apos;m not a psy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ st , a social wor@@ ker or an ex@@ per@@ t in domestic violence ."
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 2@@ 2 . I had just gra@@ du@@ ated from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge .
I had mo@@ ved to New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity for my first job as a wr@@ it@@ er and ed@@ it@@ or at S@@ even@@ te@@ en mag@@ a@@ z@@ ine .
"I had my first ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment , my first little gre@@ en American E@@ x@@ pre@@ ss car@@ d , and I had a very big se@@ cre@@ t ."
"M@@ y se@@ cre@@ t was that I had this gu@@ n lo@@ ad@@ ed with h@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ point b@@ ul@@ le@@ ts poin@@ ted at my head by the man who I thought was my s@@ ou@@ l@@ m@@ ate , many , many times ."
The man who I lo@@ ved more than any@@ body on Earth hel@@ d a gu@@ n to my head and thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill me more times than I can even remem@@ ber .
"I &apos;m here to tell you the story of c@@ ra@@ z@@ y love , a psycho@@ logical tra@@ p dis@@ gu@@ ised as love , one that m@@ illions of women and even a few men f@@ all into every year ."
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a t@@ y@@ pi@@ cal domestic violence survi@@ v@@ or .
"I have a B@@ .@@ A@@ . in Eng@@ lish from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , an M@@ B@@ A in marke@@ ting from Wh@@ ar@@ ton B@@ usiness S@@ ch@@ ool ."
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent most of my car@@ e@@ er wor@@ king for F@@ ort@@ un@@ e 5@@ 00 comp@@ an@@ ies in@@ clu@@ ding Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son &@@ a@@ mp@@ ; Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son , L@@ e@@ o B@@ ur@@ ne@@ t@@ t and The W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton P@@ ost ."
I &apos;ve been marri@@ ed for almost 20 years to my second h@@ us@@ b@@ and and we have three kids together .
"M@@ y do@@ g is a black la@@ b , and I dri@@ ve a H@@ on@@ d@@ a O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ y min@@ i@@ v@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) So my first mes@@ sage for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone — all r@@ ac@@ es , all religi@@ ons , all income and education le@@ vel@@ s ."
It &apos;s every@@ where .
"And my second mes@@ sage is that everyone thin@@ ks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s is@@ sue ."
No@@ t ex@@ actly .
"O@@ ver 8@@ 5 percent of ab@@ us@@ ers are men , and domestic ab@@ use happens only in in@@ tim@@ ate , inter@@ dep@@ end@@ ent , lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m relation@@ shi@@ ps , in other words , in fami@@ lies , the last place we would want or expe@@ ct to find violence , which is one reason domestic ab@@ use is so con@@ f@@ using ."
"I would have told you my@@ self that I was the last person on Earth who would st@@ ay with a man who be@@ at@@ s me , but in fact I was a very t@@ y@@ pi@@ cal victi@@ m because of my age ."
"I was 2@@ 2 , and in the United States , women ag@@ es 1@@ 6 to 2@@ 4 are three times as li@@ ke@@ ly to be domestic violence victi@@ ms as women of other ag@@ es , and over 5@@ 00 women and girls this age are k@@ il@@ led every year by ab@@ u@@ sive par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , bo@@ y@@ fri@@ ends , and h@@ us@@ b@@ ands in the United States ."
"I was also a very t@@ y@@ pi@@ cal victi@@ m because I knew nothing about domestic violence , its war@@ ning sign@@ s or its patter@@ ns ."
"I me@@ t Con@@ or on a co@@ ld , ra@@ iny J@@ an@@ u@@ ary ni@@ ght ."
"He s@@ at next to me on the New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity sub@@ way , and he started ch@@ at@@ ting me up ."
He told me two things .
"One was that he , too , had just gra@@ du@@ ated from an I@@ v@@ y L@@ e@@ ag@@ u@@ e school , and that he worked at a very imp@@ re@@ s@@ sive W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et b@@ ank ."
But what made the big@@ gest imp@@ re@@ s@@ sion on me that first me@@ e@@ ting was that he was s@@ mar@@ t and fun@@ n@@ y and he looked like a far@@ m bo@@ y .
"He had these big che@@ e@@ ks , these big app@@ le che@@ e@@ ks and this wh@@ e@@ at@@ -@@ bl@@ on@@ d ha@@ ir , and he see@@ m@@ ed so swe@@ et ."
"One of the s@@ mar@@ test things Con@@ or did , from the very beginning , was to create the il@@ lu@@ sion that I was the dom@@ in@@ ant par@@ t@@ ner in the relation@@ ship ."
He did this es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally at the beginning by i@@ do@@ li@@ zing me .
"We started d@@ ating , and he lo@@ ved everything about me , that I was s@@ mar@@ t , that I &apos;d g@@ one to H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , that I was pas@@ sion@@ ate about hel@@ p@@ ing te@@ en@@ age girls , and my job ."
He wanted to know everything about my family and my ch@@ il@@ d@@ h@@ ood and my hop@@ es and dre@@ a@@ ms .
"C@@ on@@ or beli@@ ev@@ ed in me , as a wr@@ it@@ er and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had ."
"And he also cre@@ ated a ma@@ gi@@ cal at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here of trust between us by con@@ f@@ ess@@ ing his se@@ cre@@ t , which was that , as a very young bo@@ y star@@ ting at age four , he had been sa@@ va@@ ge@@ ly and re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly physic@@ ally ab@@ used by his ste@@ p@@ father , and the ab@@ use had g@@ ot@@ ten so bad that he had had to dro@@ p out of school in ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de , even though he was very s@@ mar@@ t , and he &apos;d sp@@ ent almost 20 years re@@ buil@@ ding his life ."
Wh@@ ich is why that I@@ v@@ y L@@ e@@ ag@@ u@@ e de@@ g@@ ree and the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et job and his b@@ right sh@@ iny future me@@ ant so much to him .
"If you had told me that this s@@ mar@@ t , fun@@ n@@ y , sen@@ si@@ tive man who a@@ do@@ red me would one day dic@@ t@@ ate whether or not I wor@@ e ma@@ ke@@ up , how sh@@ ort my sk@@ ir@@ ts were , where I li@@ ved , what j@@ ob@@ s I took , who my fri@@ ends were and where I sp@@ ent Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , I would have la@@ u@@ gh@@ ed at you , because there was not a h@@ in@@ t of violence or contro@@ l or an@@ ger in Con@@ or at the beginning ."
I didn &apos;t know that the first st@@ age in any domestic violence relation@@ ship is to se@@ duce and char@@ m the victi@@ m .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second ste@@ p is to is@@ ol@@ ate the victi@@ m .
"Now , Con@@ or did not come home one day and an@@ n@@ oun@@ ce , &quot; &quot; You know , h@@ ey , all this R@@ ome@@ o and J@@ u@@ li@@ et stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next p@@ ha@@ se where I is@@ ol@@ ate you and I ab@@ use you &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; &quot; so I need to get you out of this ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment where the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors can hear you s@@ cre@@ am and out of this c@@ ity where you have fri@@ ends and family and co@@ wor@@ k@@ ers who can see the br@@ u@@ is@@ es . &quot; &quot; In@@ ste@@ ad , Con@@ or came home one F@@ ri@@ day even@@ ing and he told me that he had qu@@ it his job that day , his dre@@ am job , and he said that he had qu@@ it his job because of me ,"
"@@ because I had made him feel so sa@@ fe and lo@@ ved that he didn &apos;t need to pro@@ ve hi@@ m@@ self on W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et any@@ more , and he just wanted to get out of the c@@ ity and away from his ab@@ u@@ sive , d@@ y@@ s@@ fun@@ c@@ tional family , and move to a tiny to@@ wn in New Eng@@ land where he could start his life over with me by his side ."
"Now , the last thing I wanted to do was lea@@ ve New Y@@ or@@ k , and my dre@@ am job , but I thought you made s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ es for your s@@ ou@@ l@@ m@@ ate , so I ag@@ re@@ ed , and I qu@@ it my job , and Con@@ or and I left M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an together ."
"I had no idea I was f@@ all@@ ing into c@@ ra@@ z@@ y love , that I was wal@@ king he@@ ad@@ first into a car@@ e@@ fully la@@ id phy@@ sical , fin@@ an@@ cial and psycho@@ logical tra@@ p ."
The next ste@@ p in the domestic violence patter@@ n is to int@@ ro@@ duce the thre@@ at of violence and see how she re@@ ac@@ ts .
And here &apos;s where those g@@ un@@ s come in .
"As so@@ on as we mo@@ ved to New Eng@@ land — you know , that place where Con@@ n@@ or was supp@@ osed to feel so sa@@ fe — he b@@ ought three g@@ un@@ s ."
He ke@@ p@@ t one in the g@@ love com@@ par@@ t@@ ment of our ca@@ r .
"He ke@@ p@@ t one under the p@@ il@@ lo@@ ws on our b@@ ed , and the th@@ ir@@ d one he ke@@ p@@ t in his po@@ c@@ k@@ et at all times ."
And he said that he needed those g@@ un@@ s because of the tra@@ um@@ a he &apos;d experienc@@ ed as a young bo@@ y .
He needed them to feel pr@@ ot@@ ec@@ ted .
"But those g@@ un@@ s were really a mes@@ sage for me , and even though he ha@@ dn &apos;t ra@@ ised a hand to me , my life was already in gra@@ ve d@@ an@@ ger every minu@@ te of every day ."
Con@@ or first physic@@ ally att@@ ac@@ ked me five da@@ ys before our wed@@ ding .
It was 7 a@@ .@@ m@@ . I still had on my ni@@ ght@@ go@@ wn .
"I was wor@@ king on my computer trying to fin@@ ish a fre@@ el@@ ance wr@@ iting as@@ sign@@ ment , and I got f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated , and Con@@ or used my an@@ ger as an exc@@ use to put both of his h@@ ands around my nec@@ k and to s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze so ti@@ gh@@ tly that I could not brea@@ the or s@@ cre@@ am , and he used the cho@@ ke@@ hold to h@@ it my head re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly against the w@@ all ."
"F@@ i@@ ve da@@ ys later , the ten br@@ u@@ is@@ es on my nec@@ k had just fa@@ ded , and I put on my mother &apos;s wed@@ ding dre@@ ss , and I marri@@ ed him ."
"D@@ es@@ p@@ ite what had happened , I was s@@ ure we were going to live happ@@ i@@ ly ever after , because I lo@@ ved him , and he lo@@ ved me so much ."
"And he was very , very s@@ or@@ ry ."
He had just been really stre@@ ss@@ ed out by the wed@@ ding and by be@@ coming a family with me .
"It was an is@@ ol@@ ated inci@@ dent , and he was never going to h@@ ur@@ t me again ."
It happened tw@@ ice more on the hon@@ ey@@ moon .
"The first time , I was dri@@ ving to find a se@@ cre@@ t be@@ ach and I got l@@ ost , and he p@@ un@@ ched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly h@@ it the dri@@ ver &apos;s side w@@ in@@ d@@ ow ."
"And then a few da@@ ys later , dri@@ ving home from our hon@@ ey@@ moon , he got f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated by tra@@ ff@@ ic , and he thre@@ w a co@@ ld Big Ma@@ c in my face ."
Con@@ or pro@@ ce@@ eded to be@@ at me once or tw@@ ice a wee@@ k for the next two and a half years of our marri@@ age .
I was mi@@ sta@@ ken in thinking that I was uni@@ qu@@ e and al@@ one in this s@@ it@@ u@@ ation .
"One in three American women experienc@@ es domestic violence or st@@ al@@ king at some point in her life , and the C@@ D@@ C rep@@ orts that 15 million children are ab@@ used every year , 15 million ."
"So actually , I was in very good comp@@ any ."
B@@ ack to my question : Why did I st@@ ay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was ab@@ using me .
"E@@ ven though he hel@@ d those lo@@ ad@@ ed g@@ un@@ s to my head , pu@@ shed me down stair@@ s , thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill our do@@ g , pul@@ led the k@@ ey out of the ca@@ r i@@ gn@@ ition as I dro@@ ve down the high@@ way , p@@ ou@@ red co@@ ff@@ e@@ e gr@@ in@@ ds on my head as I dre@@ ss@@ ed for a job inter@@ view , I never once thought of my@@ self as a b@@ at@@ ter@@ ed wi@@ fe ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I was a very strong woman in love with a de@@ e@@ p@@ ly tr@@ ou@@ b@@ led man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Con@@ or face his de@@ m@@ ons ."
"The other question everybody as@@ ks is , why doesn &apos;t she just lea@@ ve ?"
Why didn &apos;t I wal@@ k out ? I could have left any time .
"T@@ o me , this is the sa@@ d@@ de@@ st and most pain@@ ful question that people ask , because we victi@@ ms know something you u@@ su@@ ally don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredi@@ b@@ ly d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous to lea@@ ve an ab@@ us@@ er ."
Because the fin@@ al ste@@ p in the domestic violence patter@@ n is k@@ ill her .
"O@@ ver 70 percent of domestic violence m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers happen after the victi@@ m has en@@ ded the relation@@ ship , after she &apos;s g@@ ot@@ ten out , because then the ab@@ us@@ er has nothing left to l@@ ose ."
"O@@ ther out@@ comes in@@ clu@@ de lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m st@@ al@@ king , even after the ab@@ us@@ er re@@ marri@@ es ; d@@ en@@ i@@ al of fin@@ an@@ cial re@@ sour@@ ces ; and man@@ i@@ p@@ ulation of the family cour@@ t system to ter@@ ri@@ f@@ y the victi@@ m and her children , who are re@@ g@@ ul@@ arly for@@ c@@ ed by family cour@@ t j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ es to sp@@ end un@@ super@@ vi@@ sed time with the man who be@@ at their mother ."
"And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just lea@@ ve ?"
"I was able to lea@@ ve , because of one fin@@ al , sa@@ dis@@ tic be@@ ating that bro@@ ke through my d@@ en@@ i@@ al ."
I re@@ alized that the man who I lo@@ ved so much was going to k@@ ill me if I let him .
So I bro@@ ke the si@@ l@@ ence .
"I told everyone : the poli@@ ce , my ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors , my fri@@ ends and family , t@@ ot@@ al str@@ ang@@ ers , and I &apos;m here today because you all hel@@ p@@ ed me ."
"We t@@ end to ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e victi@@ ms as g@@ ri@@ s@@ ly he@@ ad@@ l@@ ines , self-@@ de@@ struc@@ tive women , da@@ mag@@ ed go@@ o@@ ds ."
"The question , &quot; &quot; Why does she st@@ ay ? &quot; &quot; is co@@ de for some people for , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s her fa@@ ult for sta@@ ying , &quot; &quot; as if victi@@ ms int@@ enti@@ on@@ ally cho@@ ose to f@@ all in love with men int@@ ent up@@ on de@@ stro@@ ying us ."
"But since publi@@ shing &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ z@@ y L@@ ove , &quot; &quot; I have heard hund@@ re@@ ds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an inv@@ alu@@ able life le@@ s@@ son from what happened , and who re@@ built lives — jo@@ y@@ ous , happy lives — as emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , wi@@ ves and mo@@ thers , lives comple@@ tely f@@ ree of violence , like me ."
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very t@@ y@@ pi@@ cal domestic violence victi@@ m and a t@@ y@@ pi@@ cal domestic violence survi@@ v@@ or .
"I re@@ marri@@ ed a kind and g@@ ent@@ le man , and we have those three kids ."
"I have that black la@@ b , and I have that min@@ i@@ v@@ an ."
"What I will never have again , ever , is a lo@@ ad@@ ed gu@@ n hel@@ d to my head by someone who says that he lo@@ ves me ."
"@@ R@@ ight now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; W@@ ow , this is f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , how stu@@ p@@ id was she , &quot; &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you ."
I pr@@ om@@ ise you there are se@@ ver@@ al people li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to me right now who are cur@@ r@@ ently being ab@@ used or who were ab@@ used as children or who are ab@@ us@@ ers the@@ m@@ selves .
"A@@ b@@ use could be a@@ ffec@@ ting your daughter , your sist@@ er , your best fri@@ end right now ."
I was able to end my own c@@ ra@@ z@@ y love story by brea@@ king the si@@ l@@ ence .
I &apos;m still brea@@ king the si@@ l@@ ence today .
"It &apos;s my way of hel@@ p@@ ing other victi@@ ms , and it &apos;s my fin@@ al re@@ qu@@ est of you ."
T@@ al@@ k about what you heard here .
A@@ b@@ use th@@ ri@@ ves only in si@@ l@@ ence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by sh@@ ining a sp@@ ot@@ light on it .
We victi@@ ms need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the se@@ cre@@ ts of domestic violence .
"S@@ how ab@@ use the light of day by talking about it with your children , your co@@ wor@@ k@@ ers , your fri@@ ends and family ."
"@@ Re@@ ca@@ st survi@@ v@@ ors as wonderful , lo@@ v@@ able people with ful@@ l fu@@ tures ."
"@@ R@@ ec@@ o@@ gn@@ ize the early sign@@ s of violence and con@@ scienti@@ ously inter@@ v@@ en@@ e , de@@ es@@ cal@@ ate it , show victi@@ ms a sa@@ fe way out ."
"T@@ o@@ gether we can make our be@@ ds , our d@@ in@@ ner t@@ ab@@ les and our fami@@ lies the sa@@ fe and pe@@ ace@@ ful o@@ as@@ es they should be ."
Thank you .

"This , I think , is so de@@ e@@ p@@ ly em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the water supp@@ ly that it wouldn &apos;t o@@ cc@@ ur to any@@ one to question it ."
This is my super@@ mark@@ et .
"One con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the ph@@ one never bro@@ ke ."
"We now have an almost un@@ lim@@ ited v@@ ari@@ e@@ ty of ph@@ ones , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in the world of cell ph@@ ones ."

You want bu@@ tt@@ on f@@ ly or z@@ i@@ pp@@ er f@@ ly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ wa@@ shed or ac@@ i@@ d@@ -@@ wa@@ shed ?
"I had very low , no particular expe@@ c@@ ta@@ tions when they only came in one f@@ la@@ v@@ or ."
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t have done better .

"And so the net resul@@ t is that we do better in gener@@ al , ob@@ jec@@ tively , and we feel worse ."
So let me re@@ mind you .
There &apos;s some ma@@ gi@@ cal amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
They actually make us worse off .
Thank you very much .
E@@ very@@ body tal@@ ks about happiness these da@@ ys .
"There is a hu@@ ge wa@@ ve of inter@@ est in happiness , am@@ ong resear@@ ch@@ ers ."
There is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
E@@ very@@ body would like to make people happ@@ i@@ er .
And my talk today will be m@@ os@@ tly about these cogn@@ itive tr@@ aps .
"This app@@ lies to lay@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as m@@ ess@@ ed up as any@@ body else is ."
The first of these tr@@ aps is a re@@ l@@ uc@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ m@@ it comple@@ x@@ ity .
"It turns out that the word &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; is just not a u@@ se@@ ful word any@@ more , because we app@@ ly it to too many different things ."
"And those are two very different con@@ cep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both lu@@ mp@@ ed in the no@@ tion of happiness ."
"I mean , this is a real cogn@@ itive tra@@ p ."
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
"Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a ques@@ tion@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ answer se@@ s@@ sion after one of my lec@@ tures rep@@ or@@ ted a story , and that was a story — He said he &apos;d been li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to a sy@@ mp@@ hon@@ y , and it was ab@@ solu@@ tely g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the rec@@ ord@@ ing , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful s@@ cre@@ e@@ ching sound ."
"And then he ad@@ ded , really quite e@@ mo@@ tion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience ."
But it ha@@ dn &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ ined were the me@@ mor@@ ies of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous music .
"They coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a mem@@ ory ; the mem@@ ory was ru@@ ined , and the mem@@ ory was all that he had g@@ ot@@ ten to keep ."
"There is an experienc@@ ing self , who lives in the pres@@ ent and kno@@ ws the pres@@ ent , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ li@@ ving the past , but ba@@ sically it has only the pres@@ ent ."
"It &apos;s the experienc@@ ing self that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es — you know , when the doc@@ tor as@@ ks , &quot; D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I tou@@ ch you here ? &quot;"
"And then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ e@@ ps sc@@ ore , and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ins the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feel@@ ing l@@ ately ? &quot;"
or &quot; &quot; How was your tri@@ p to A@@ l@@ b@@ an@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; or something like that .
"Th@@ ose are two very different enti@@ ties , the experienc@@ ing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting con@@ f@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the no@@ tion of happiness ."
"Now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ er ."
And that really star@@ ts with a ba@@ sic respon@@ se of our me@@ mor@@ ies — it star@@ ts im@@ medi@@ ately .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
And let me beg@@ in with one example .
They were asked to rep@@ ort on their pa@@ in every 60 secon@@ ds .
"@@ Here are two patients , those are their rec@@ ord@@ ings ."
"And you are asked , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o of them suff@@ er@@ ed more ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a very easy question ."
"C@@ lear@@ ly , P@@ ati@@ ent B suff@@ er@@ ed more — his col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y was longer , and every minu@@ te of pa@@ in that P@@ ati@@ ent A had , P@@ ati@@ ent B had , and more ."
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suff@@ er@@ ed ? &quot;
And here is a surpri@@ se .
The surpri@@ se is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much worse mem@@ ory of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
"The stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies were different , and because a very cri@@ tical part of the story is how it ends ."
And ne@@ i@@ ther of these stories is very in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing or great — but one of them is this dist@@ in@@ ct ... ( Laughter ) but one of them is dist@@ in@@ c@@ tly worse than the other .
And the one that is worse is the one where pa@@ in was at its pe@@ a@@ k at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
"Because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in t@@ ot@@ al ? &quot;"
"And it was much worse for A than for B , in mem@@ ory ."
Now this is a di@@ re@@ ct con@@ f@@ li@@ ct between the experienc@@ ing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experienc@@ ing self , c@@ lear@@ ly , B had a worse time ."
"Now , what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A , and we actually r@@ an cl@@ ini@@ cal experi@@ ments , and it has been done , and it does work — you could actually ex@@ t@@ end the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ e@@ p@@ ing the tu@@ be in without j@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ ling it too much ."
"That will cause the pati@@ ent to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before ."
"And that is true of the stories that mem@@ ory de@@ li@@ ver@@ s for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up ."
"What defin@@ es a story are changes , sign@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant mom@@ ents and end@@ ings ."
"@@ En@@ d@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the en@@ ding dom@@ in@@ ated ."
"Now , the experienc@@ ing self lives its life continu@@ ously ."
"It has mom@@ ents of experience , one after the other ."
And you can ask : What happens to these mom@@ ents ?
And the answer is really stra@@ i@@ ght@@ for@@ ward : They are l@@ ost fore@@ ver .
M@@ ost of them are comple@@ tely i@@ g@@ no@@ red by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"And yet , some@@ how you get the sense that they should coun@@ t , that what happens d@@ uring these mom@@ ents of experience is our life ."
It &apos;s the fin@@ ite re@@ sour@@ ce that we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding while we &apos;re on this ear@@ th .
"And how to sp@@ end it would seem to be rele@@ v@@ ant , but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self ke@@ e@@ ps for us ."
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experienc@@ ing self , if you have a va@@ cation , and the second wee@@ k is just as good as the first , then the tw@@ o@@ -@@ wee@@ k va@@ cation is tw@@ ice as good as the on@@ e-@@ wee@@ k va@@ cation ."
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
The experienc@@ ing self has no vo@@ ice in this cho@@ ice .
"We actually don &apos;t cho@@ ose between experienc@@ es , we cho@@ ose between me@@ mor@@ ies of experienc@@ es ."
"And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future n@@ orm@@ ally as experienc@@ es ."
We think of our future as an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated me@@ mor@@ ies .
"I have that sense that when we go on va@@ ca@@ tions this is very fre@@ qu@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on va@@ ca@@ tions , to a very lar@@ ge ex@@ t@@ ent , in the serv@@ ice of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self ."
And this is a bit hard to j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y I think .
"I mean , how much do we con@@ su@@ me our me@@ mor@@ ies ?"
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is gi@@ ven for the dom@@ in@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"Now , that is three wee@@ ks , and that is at most an h@@ our and a half ."
There seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ p@@ anc@@ y .
"Now , I may be a bit extre@@ me , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te I have for con@@ su@@ m@@ ing me@@ mor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : Why do we put so much we@@ ight on mem@@ ory rela@@ tive to the we@@ ight that we put on experienc@@ es ?"
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
"I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next va@@ cation , you know that at the end of the va@@ cation all your pic@@ tures will be de@@ stro@@ y@@ ed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ ne@@ sic dru@@ g so that you won &apos;t remem@@ ber anything ."
Why do we pic@@ k the va@@ ca@@ tions we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a cho@@ ice between the two selves .
"Now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness ."
"There are really two con@@ cep@@ ts of happiness that we can app@@ ly , one per self ."
So you can ask : How happy is the experienc@@ ing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the mom@@ ents in the experienc@@ ing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all — happiness for mom@@ ents is a fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ lica@@ ted process .
What are the e@@ mo@@ tions that can be meas@@ u@@ red ?
"And , by the way , now we are cap@@ able of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experienc@@ ing self over time ."
It is about how sa@@ tis@@ fied or ple@@ as@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life .
V@@ ery different no@@ tion .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ one who doesn &apos;t dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to m@@ ess up the study of happiness , and I be@@ long to a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d of students of well-being , who &apos;ve been m@@ ess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in preci@@ se@@ ly this way ."
"The dist@@ in@@ c@@ tion between the happiness of the experienc@@ ing self and the sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogn@@ iz@@ ed in re@@ cent years , and there are now e@@ ff@@ orts to measure the two se@@ par@@ ately ."
"So in re@@ cent years , we have be@@ gu@@ n to learn about the happiness of the two selves ."
And the ma@@ in le@@ s@@ son I think that we have learned is they are really different .
"@@ J@@ ust to give you a sense of the cor@@ rela@@ tion , the cor@@ rela@@ tion is about .@@ 5 ."
"What that means is if you me@@ t somebody , and you were told , &quot; &quot; O@@ h his father is six fe@@ et t@@ all , &quot; &quot; how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?"
You have that much un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty .
So the cor@@ rela@@ tion is low .
We know something about what contro@@ ls sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
"We know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important ."
"We know that happiness is ma@@ in@@ ly being sa@@ tis@@ fied with people that we like , sp@@ en@@ ding time with people that we like ."
"There are other ple@@ as@@ ures , but this is dom@@ in@@ ant ."
The bot@@ tom l@@ ine of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ sti@@ tu@@ te for well-being .
It is a comple@@ tely different no@@ tion .
"Now , very quic@@ kly , another reason we cannot think stra@@ ight about happiness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live ."
"So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , you are not going to get to the cor@@ re@@ ct answer ."
"Well , it turns out that c@@ lim@@ ate is not very important to the experienc@@ ing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the re@@ f@@ lec@@ tive self that deci@@ des how happy people are ."
We know that .
"It is very difficult to think stra@@ ight about well-being , and I hop@@ e I have gi@@ ven you a sense of how difficult it is ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
"Now , when we were on the ph@@ one a few wee@@ ks ago , you m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting resul@@ t came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey ."
"When we looked at how feel@@ ings , v@@ ary with income ."
"And it turns out that , be@@ low an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for Americ@@ ans — and that &apos;s a very lar@@ ge sa@@ mple of Americ@@ ans , like 6@@ 00@@ ,000 , so it &apos;s a lar@@ ge re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ta@@ tive sa@@ mple — be@@ low an income of 6@@ 00@@ ,000 dollars a year ..@@ ."
"C@@ A : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"D@@ K : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"( Laughter ) 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get progre@@ s@@ si@@ vely un@@ happ@@ i@@ er the p@@ oo@@ re@@ r they get ."
"A@@ bo@@ ve that , we get an ab@@ solu@@ tely fl@@ at l@@ ine ."
I mean I &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely se@@ en l@@ ines so fl@@ at .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ enti@@ al happiness , but l@@ ack of money cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly bu@@ ys you mi@@ ser@@ y , and we can measure that mi@@ ser@@ y very , very c@@ lear@@ ly ."
"In terms of the other self , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story ."
"The more money you ear@@ n , the more sa@@ tis@@ fied you are ."
That does not hold for e@@ mo@@ tions .
"C@@ A : But D@@ an@@ n@@ y , the whole American en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ or is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ su@@ it of happiness ."
"If people took ser@@ i@@ ously that fin@@ ding , I mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation poli@@ c@@ y and so for@@ th ."
Pe@@ ople are recogn@@ iz@@ ing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of publi@@ c poli@@ c@@ y .
"This is going to in@@ flu@@ ence poli@@ c@@ y , I think , in years to come ."
"This is going to be , I think , within the next de@@ ca@@ de or two , part of national st@@ ati@@ s@@ tics ."
"C@@ A : Well , it seems to me that this is@@ sue will — or at lea@@ st should be — the most interesting poli@@ c@@ y di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion to tr@@ ack over the next few years ."
"For the next few minutes we &apos;re going to talk about energy , and it &apos;s going to be a bit of a v@@ ari@@ ed talk ."
"I &apos;ll try to sp@@ in a story about energy , and oil &apos;s a con@@ v@@ en@@ i@@ ent star@@ ting place ."
"The talk will be bro@@ ad@@ ly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start ."
And one of the reas@@ ons is this is re@@ mark@@ able stuff .
"You take about eight or so car@@ b@@ on at@@ oms , about 20 hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en at@@ oms , you put them together in ex@@ actly the right way and you get this mar@@ vel@@ ous li@@ qu@@ id : very ener@@ g@@ y-@@ d@@ en@@ se and very easy to re@@ f@@ ine into a number of very u@@ se@@ ful produc@@ ts and fu@@ el@@ s ."
It &apos;s great stuff .
"Now , as far as it goes , there &apos;s a lot of oil out there in the world ."
Here &apos;s my little po@@ c@@ k@@ et ma@@ p of where it &apos;s all lo@@ ca@@ ted .
A big@@ ger one for you to look at .
"But this is it , this is the oil in the world ."
G@@ e@@ o@@ logi@@ sts have a pretty good idea of where the oil is .
This is about 100 tri@@ l@@ li@@ on g@@ all@@ ons of c@@ ru@@ de oil still to be developed and produc@@ ed in the world today .
"Now , that &apos;s just one story about oil , and we could end it there and say , &quot; &quot; Well , oil &apos;s going to last fore@@ ver because , well , there &apos;s just a lot of it . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s actually more to the story than that ."
"O@@ h , by the way , if you think you &apos;re very far from some of this oil , 1@@ 000 me@@ ters be@@ low where you &apos;re all s@@ it@@ ting is one of the lar@@ gest produc@@ ing oil fiel@@ ds in the world ."
"C@@ ome talk to me about it , I &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the deta@@ il@@ s if you want ."
"So , that &apos;s one of the stories of oil ; there &apos;s just a lot of it ."
But what about oil ? Wh@@ ere is it in the energy system ?
"@@ Here &apos;s a little s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of 150 years of oil , and it &apos;s been a dom@@ in@@ ant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years ."
"Now , here &apos;s another little se@@ cre@@ t I &apos;m going to tell you about : F@@ or the last 2@@ 5 years , oil has been p@@ la@@ ying less and less of a ro@@ le in global energy syste@@ ms ."
"There was one kind of pe@@ a@@ k oil in 19@@ 8@@ 5 , when oil re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted 50 percent of global energy supp@@ ly ."
"Now , it &apos;s about 3@@ 5 percent ."
It &apos;s been de@@ cl@@ ining and I believe it will continu@@ e to de@@ cl@@ ine .
G@@ as@@ ol@@ ine con@@ su@@ mp@@ tion in the U.S@@ . probably pe@@ a@@ ked in 200@@ 7 and is de@@ cl@@ ining .
So oil is p@@ la@@ ying a less sign@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant ro@@ le every year .
"And so , 2@@ 5 years ago , there was a pe@@ a@@ k oil ; just like , in the 19@@ 20@@ s , there was a pe@@ a@@ k co@@ al ; and a hundred years before that , there was a pe@@ a@@ k w@@ ood ."
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy syste@@ ms .
And what &apos;s been ta@@ king up the s@@ l@@ ack in the last few de@@ ca@@ des ?
"Well , a lot of natural g@@ as and a little bit of n@@ uc@@ lear , for star@@ ters ."
And what goes on in the future ?
"Well , I think out a@@ head of us a few de@@ ca@@ des is pe@@ a@@ k g@@ as , and be@@ y@@ on@@ d that , pe@@ a@@ k r@@ ene@@ w@@ ab@@ les ."
"Now , I &apos;ll tell you another little , very important story about this picture ."
"Now , I &apos;m not pre@@ ten@@ ding that energy use in t@@ ot@@ al isn &apos;t increas@@ ing , it is — that &apos;s another part of the story . C@@ ome talk to me about it , we &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the deta@@ il@@ s — but there &apos;s a very important mes@@ sage here : This is 200 years of history , and for 200 years we &apos;ve been syste@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally de@@ car@@ b@@ on@@ iz@@ ing our energy system ."
"@@ En@@ er@@ gy syste@@ ms of the world be@@ coming progre@@ s@@ si@@ vely — year on year , de@@ ca@@ de on de@@ ca@@ de , century on century — be@@ coming less car@@ b@@ on int@@ en@@ se ."
"And that continu@@ es into the future with the r@@ ene@@ w@@ ab@@ les that we &apos;re develop@@ ing today , re@@ ach@@ ing maybe 30 percent of pri@@ mar@@ y energy by mi@@ d century ."
"Now that might be the end of the story — O@@ kay , we just re@@ place it all with con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal r@@ ene@@ w@@ ab@@ les — but I think , actually , there &apos;s more to the story than that ."
And to tell the next part of the story — and this is looking out say 2@@ 100 and be@@ y@@ on@@ d .
"What is the future of tru@@ ly su@@ sta@@ in@@ able , car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ f@@ ree energy ?"
"Well , we have to take a little ex@@ cur@@ sion , and we &apos;ll start in cen@@ tr@@ al T@@ ex@@ as ."
Here &apos;s a piece of li@@ me@@ st@@ one .
"I pic@@ ked it up outside of M@@ ar@@ ble F@@ all@@ s , T@@ ex@@ as ."
It &apos;s about 4@@ 00 million years old .
"And it &apos;s just li@@ me@@ st@@ one , nothing really spe@@ cial about it ."
"Now , here &apos;s a piece of ch@@ al@@ k ."
I pic@@ ked this up at M@@ I@@ T . It &apos;s a little youn@@ ger .
"And it &apos;s different than this li@@ me@@ st@@ one , you can see that ."
"You wouldn &apos;t build a buil@@ ding out of this stuff , and you wouldn &apos;t try to give a lec@@ ture and wr@@ ite on the ch@@ al@@ k@@ bo@@ ard with this ."
"@@ Y@@ ea@@ h , it &apos;s very different — no , it &apos;s not different ."
"It &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate , cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate ."
What &apos;s different is how the mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es are put together .
"Now , if you think that &apos;s kind of ne@@ at , the story gets really ne@@ at right now ."
O@@ ff the co@@ a@@ st of C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a comes this : It &apos;s an ab@@ al@@ one sh@@ ell .
"Now , m@@ illions of ab@@ al@@ one every year make this sh@@ ell ."
"O@@ h , by the way , just in case you wer@@ en &apos;t already gu@@ ess@@ ing , it &apos;s cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate ."
It &apos;s the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this .
But it &apos;s not the same stuff ; it &apos;s different .
"It &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3@@ ,000 times tou@@ gh@@ er than this ."
"And why ? Because the lo@@ w@@ ly ab@@ al@@ one is able to l@@ ay down the cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ als in lay@@ ers , making this beautiful , i@@ ri@@ de@@ sc@@ ent mother of pe@@ ar@@ l ."
"@@ V@@ ery speci@@ alized material that the ab@@ al@@ one self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ les , m@@ illions of ab@@ al@@ one , all the time , every day , every year ."
This is pretty incredi@@ ble stuff .
"A@@ ll the same , what &apos;s different ?"
How the mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es are put together .
"Now , what does this have to do with energy ?"
Here &apos;s a piece of co@@ al .
And I &apos;ll sug@@ gest that this co@@ al is about as exc@@ iting as this ch@@ al@@ k .
"Now , whether we &apos;re talking about fu@@ el@@ s or energy car@@ ri@@ ers , or perhaps no@@ vel materi@@ als for b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies or fu@@ el cells , nature ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t ever built those per@@ fe@@ ct materi@@ als yet because nature didn &apos;t need to ."
"@@ N@@ ature didn &apos;t need to because , un@@ like the ab@@ al@@ one sh@@ ell , the survi@@ val of a speci@@ es didn &apos;t dep@@ end on buil@@ ding those materi@@ als , until maybe now when it might just matter ."
"So , when we think about the future of energy , imagine what would it be like if instead of this , we could build the energy equ@@ i@@ v@@ al@@ ent of this just by re@@ ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ing the mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es differ@@ ently ."
And so that is my story .
The oil will never ru@@ n out .
It &apos;s not because we have a lot of it .
It &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a ba@@ j@@ illion w@@ in@@ d@@ mil@@ ls .
"It &apos;s because , well , thousands of years ago , people inv@@ en@@ ted ideas — they had ideas , in@@ no@@ v@@ ations , technology — and the St@@ one A@@ ge en@@ ded , not because we r@@ an out of st@@ ones ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s ideas , it &apos;s in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , it &apos;s technology that will end the age of oil , long before we ru@@ n out of oil ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Thank you . I have to tell you I &apos;m both chall@@ eng@@ ed and exc@@ ited .
T@@ R : Th@@ an@@ ks for the inter@@ action on a high level there .
"But if you ask people , why didn &apos;t you achi@@ e@@ ve something ?"
"S@@ ome@@ body who &apos;s wor@@ king for you , or a par@@ t@@ ner , or even yourself ."
( Applause ) ( Laughter ) And you cor@@ re@@ ct me if I &apos;m wrong .
"Wh@@ o &apos;s been there ? S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : A@@ y@@ e ."
We need v@@ ari@@ e@@ ty . We need surpri@@ se .
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about my@@ self that day .
"In my own hum@@ an@@ ity and mi@@ sta@@ kes , I &apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried ."
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been pre@@ par@@ ing for it our whole lives .
How do you explain when things don &apos;t go as we as@@ su@@ me ?
"O@@ r better , how do you explain when others are able to achi@@ e@@ ve things that seem to de@@ f@@ y all of the as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions ?"
F@@ or example : Why is App@@ le so in@@ no@@ v@@ ative ?
"@@ Y@@ e@@ ar after year , after year , they &apos;re more in@@ no@@ v@@ ative than all their com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"And yet , they &apos;re just a computer comp@@ any ."
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
Why is it that M@@ arti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing led the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ i@@ ghts M@@ o@@ ve@@ ment ?
"He was@@ n &apos;t the only man who suff@@ er@@ ed in pre@@ -@@ ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts America , and he cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly was@@ n &apos;t the only great or@@ at@@ or of the day ."
"And this disco@@ very prof@@ oun@@ dly chang@@ ed my view on how I thought the world worked , and it even prof@@ oun@@ dly chang@@ ed the way in which I op@@ er@@ ate in it ."
"As it turns out , there &apos;s a patter@@ n ."
And it &apos;s the comple@@ te op@@ pos@@ ite to everyone else .
"A@@ ll I did was co@@ di@@ f@@ y it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s simp@@ le@@ st idea ."
I call it the gol@@ d@@ en circ@@ le .
This little idea expla@@ ins why some organiz@@ ations and some lead@@ ers are able to in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e where others ar@@ en &apos;t .
Let me de@@ f@@ ine the terms really quic@@ kly .
"E@@ very single person , every single organiz@@ ation on the planet kno@@ ws what they do , 100 percent ."
"But very , very few people or organiz@@ ations know why they do what they do ."
"B@@ y &quot; &quot; why , &quot; &quot; I mean : What &apos;s your pur@@ p@@ ose ?"
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your belie@@ f ?
Why do you get out of b@@ ed in the mor@@ ning ?
I use App@@ le because they &apos;re easy to understand and everybody gets it .
"They &apos;re beau@@ ti@@ fully de@@ sign@@ ed , simple to use and us@@ er fri@@ end@@ ly ."
Here &apos;s how App@@ le actually comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ tes .
"&quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing we do , we believe in chall@@ eng@@ ing the st@@ at@@ us qu@@ o ."
We believe in thinking differ@@ ently .
We just happen to make great compu@@ ters .
"But we &apos;re also per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly com@@ for@@ table bu@@ ying an M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er from App@@ le , or a ph@@ one from App@@ le , or a D@@ V@@ R from App@@ le ."
Th@@ e@@ ir com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tors are equ@@ ally qu@@ ali@@ fied to make all of these produc@@ ts .
"A few years ago , G@@ at@@ e@@ way came out with fl@@ at@@ -@@ s@@ cre@@ en T@@ V@@ s ."
They &apos;re e@@ min@@ ently qu@@ ali@@ fied to make fl@@ at@@ -@@ s@@ cre@@ en T@@ V@@ s .
No@@ body b@@ ought one .
It &apos;s all gr@@ oun@@ ded in the t@@ ene@@ ts of bio@@ logy .
"@@ No@@ t psycho@@ logy , bio@@ logy ."
"O@@ ur ne@@ we@@ st brain , our H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ en brain , our ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x , cor@@ respon@@ ds with the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; level ."
The ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x is respon@@ sible for all of our ra@@ tional and an@@ al@@ y@@ tical thought and language .
"The mi@@ ddle two se@@ c@@ tions make up our lim@@ bi@@ c bra@@ ins , and our lim@@ bi@@ c bra@@ ins are respon@@ sible for all of our feel@@ ings , like trust and lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty ."
It just doesn &apos;t dri@@ ve behavi@@ or .
This is where g@@ ut deci@@ sions come from .
The go@@ al is not just to h@@ ir@@ e people who need a job ; it &apos;s to h@@ ir@@ e people who believe what you believe .
M@@ ost people don &apos;t know about S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ i@@ er@@ p@@ on@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley .
"And S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ i@@ er@@ p@@ on@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley had , what we as@@ su@@ me , to be the re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for success ."
M@@ on@@ ey was no problem .
He hi@@ red the best min@@ ds money could find and the mark@@ et con@@ di@@ tions were f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic .
"The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es fol@@ lo@@ wed him around every@@ where , and everyone was ro@@ ot@@ ing for L@@ ang@@ ley ."
Th@@ en how come we &apos;ve never heard of S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ i@@ er@@ p@@ on@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley ?
"The difference was , O@@ r@@ vil@@ le and W@@ il@@ bu@@ r were dri@@ ven by a cause , by a pur@@ p@@ ose , by a belie@@ f ."
"They beli@@ ev@@ ed that if they could fig@@ ure out this fl@@ ying mach@@ ine , it &apos;ll change the course of the world ."
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the resul@@ t .
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the ri@@ ch@@ es .
"And l@@ o and be@@ hold , look what happened ."
The others just worked for the pa@@ y@@ ch@@ ec@@ k .
"He was@@ n &apos;t first , he didn &apos;t get rich , he didn &apos;t get fa@@ m@@ ous , so he qu@@ it ."
But why is it important to at@@ tr@@ act those who believe what you believe ?
The next 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 5 % of our population are our early ad@@ op@@ ters .
"And these gu@@ ys , the in@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ ors and the early ad@@ op@@ ters , they &apos;re com@@ for@@ table making those g@@ ut deci@@ sions ."
"And , by the way , they didn &apos;t do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for the@@ m@@ selves ."
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
"In fact , people will do the things that pro@@ ve what they believe ."
"So let me give you a fa@@ m@@ ous example , a fa@@ m@@ ous fa@@ il@@ ure and a fa@@ m@@ ous success of the la@@ w of diff@@ u@@ sion of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ."
It &apos;s a com@@ mer@@ cial example .
I T@@ i@@ V@@ o stuff on my pi@@ ec@@ e-@@ o@@ f-@@ j@@ un@@ k T@@ i@@ me W@@ ar@@ ner D@@ V@@ R all the time .
They &apos;ve never made money .
"And when they went I@@ P@@ O , their sto@@ ck was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then pl@@ um@@ me@@ ted , and it &apos;s never tra@@ ded ab@@ ove 10 ."
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
"In the su@@ mm@@ er of 19@@ 6@@ 3 , 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 people showed up on the m@@ all in W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton to hear D@@ r@@ . K@@ ing spea@@ k ."
How do you do that ?
But he had a gi@@ ft .
How many of them showed up for him ?
They showed up for the@@ m@@ selves .
"We fol@@ lo@@ wed , not for him , but for our@@ selves ."
Because there are lead@@ ers and there are those who le@@ ad .
"@@ L@@ e@@ ad@@ ers hold a position of power or au@@ th@@ or@@ ity , but those who le@@ ad in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e us ."
"I ’ m going around the world giving tal@@ ks about D@@ ar@@ w@@ in , and u@@ su@@ ally what I ’ m talking about is D@@ ar@@ w@@ in ’ s stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"Now that ti@@ t@@ le , that ph@@ ra@@ se , comes from a cri@@ tic , an early cri@@ tic , and this is a pas@@ sage that I just love , and would like to read for you ."
"&quot; &quot; In the theory with which we have to de@@ al , A@@ b@@ solu@@ te I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance is the arti@@ f@@ ic@@ er ; so that we may en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate as the f@@ und@@ am@@ ental pr@@ inci@@ ple of the whole system , that , in order to make a per@@ fe@@ ct and beautiful mach@@ ine , it is not re@@ qu@@ is@@ ite to know how to make it ."
"This pro@@ position will be found on car@@ e@@ ful ex@@ am@@ in@@ ation to ex@@ pre@@ ss , in con@@ d@@ en@@ sed form , the essenti@@ al pur@@ p@@ ort of the Th@@ e@@ ory , and to ex@@ pre@@ ss in a few words all M@@ r@@ . D@@ ar@@ w@@ in ’ s me@@ an@@ ing ; who , by a stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing , seems to think A@@ b@@ solu@@ te I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance fully qu@@ ali@@ fied to take the place of A@@ b@@ solu@@ te W@@ is@@ dom in the achi@@ ev@@ e@@ ments of cre@@ ative sk@@ ill . &quot; &quot; E@@ x@@ actly . E@@ x@@ actly . And it is a stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion ."
A cre@@ ati@@ on@@ ist pa@@ mp@@ h@@ let has this wonderful p@@ age in it : &quot; &quot; T@@ est T@@ w@@ o : Do you know of any buil@@ ding that didn ’ t have a buil@@ der ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any pain@@ ting that didn ’ t have a pain@@ ter ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any ca@@ r that didn ’ t have a ma@@ ker ? Y@@ es / No .
"If you ans@@ wer@@ ed &apos; Y@@ es &apos; for any of the ab@@ ove , give deta@@ il@@ s . &quot; &quot; A@@ -@@ h@@ a ! I mean , it really is a stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
You would have thought it st@@ ands to reason that desi@@ gn re@@ qui@@ res an intellig@@ ent de@@ sign@@ er .
But D@@ ar@@ w@@ in sho@@ ws that it ’ s just f@@ al@@ se .
"T@@ o@@ day , though , I ’ m going to talk about D@@ ar@@ w@@ in ’ s other stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion , which is equ@@ ally pu@@ z@@ z@@ ling at first , but in some ways just as important ."
It st@@ ands to reason that we love cho@@ col@@ ate ca@@ ke because it is swe@@ et .
G@@ u@@ ys go for girls like this because they are se@@ x@@ y .
We ad@@ ore b@@ ab@@ ies because they ’ re so cu@@ te .
"And , of course , we are am@@ used by jo@@ kes because they are fun@@ n@@ y ."
This is all bac@@ k@@ wards . It is . And D@@ ar@@ w@@ in sho@@ ws us why .
"@@ Let ’ s start with swe@@ et . O@@ ur swe@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is ba@@ sically an ev@@ olved sug@@ ar de@@ te@@ c@@ tor , because sug@@ ar is high energy , and it ’ s just been wi@@ red up to the pre@@ fer@@ er , to put it very c@@ ru@@ de@@ ly , and that ’ s why we like sug@@ ar ."
"H@@ on@@ ey is swe@@ et because we like it , not &quot; &quot; we like it because hon@@ ey is swe@@ et . &quot; &quot; There ’ s nothing in@@ tr@@ in@@ sically swe@@ et about hon@@ ey ."
"If you looked at g@@ l@@ uc@@ ose mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es ti@@ ll you were bl@@ ind , you wouldn ’ t see why they ta@@ st@@ ed swe@@ et ."
You have to look in our bra@@ ins to understand why they ’ re swe@@ et .
"So if you think first there was s@@ wee@@ t@@ ness , and then we ev@@ olved to like s@@ wee@@ t@@ ness , you ’ ve got it bac@@ k@@ wards ; that ’ s just wrong . It ’ s the other way r@@ ound ."
S@@ wee@@ t@@ ness was born with the w@@ ir@@ ing which ev@@ olved .
And there ’ s nothing in@@ tr@@ in@@ sically se@@ x@@ y about these young la@@ di@@ es .
"And it ’ s a good thing that there isn ’ t , because if there were , then M@@ other N@@ ature would have a problem : How on ear@@ th do you get ch@@ imp@@ s to m@@ ate ?"
"Now you might think , a@@ h , there ’ s a s@@ olution : h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ations ."
"That would be one way of doing it , but there ’ s a quic@@ ker way ."
"@@ J@@ ust w@@ ir@@ e the ch@@ imp@@ s up to love that look , and app@@ ar@@ ently they do ."
That ’ s all there is to it .
"O@@ ver six million years , we and the ch@@ imp@@ s ev@@ olved our different ways ."
"We be@@ came bal@@ d@@ -@@ bo@@ di@@ ed , o@@ dd@@ ly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn ’ t ."
"If we ha@@ dn ’ t , then probably this would be the he@@ ight of se@@ x@@ iness ."
O@@ ur swe@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is an ev@@ olved and inst@@ in@@ c@@ tu@@ al pre@@ fer@@ ence for high@@ -@@ energy f@@ ood .
It was@@ n ’ t de@@ sign@@ ed for cho@@ col@@ ate ca@@ ke .
Ch@@ o@@ col@@ ate ca@@ ke is a super@@ n@@ orm@@ al sti@@ mul@@ us .
"The ter@@ m is o@@ wed to N@@ i@@ k@@ o T@@ in@@ ber@@ g@@ en , who did his fa@@ m@@ ous experi@@ ments with g@@ ul@@ ls , where he found that that or@@ an@@ ge sp@@ o@@ t on the g@@ ul@@ l ’ s be@@ a@@ k — if he made a big@@ ger , or@@ an@@ ger sp@@ o@@ t the g@@ ul@@ l ch@@ ic@@ ks would pe@@ ck at it even har@@ der ."
"It was a hy@@ per@@ sti@@ mul@@ us for them , and they lo@@ ved it ."
"What we see with , say , cho@@ col@@ ate ca@@ ke is it ’ s a super@@ n@@ orm@@ al sti@@ mul@@ us to tw@@ ea@@ k our desi@@ gn w@@ ir@@ ing ."
And there are lots of super@@ n@@ orm@@ al sti@@ mul@@ i ; cho@@ col@@ ate ca@@ ke is one .
There &apos;s lots of super@@ n@@ orm@@ al sti@@ mul@@ i for se@@ x@@ iness .
And there &apos;s even super@@ n@@ orm@@ al sti@@ mul@@ i for cu@@ ten@@ ess . Here ’ s a pretty good example .
"It ’ s important that we love b@@ ab@@ ies , and that we not be put off by , say , m@@ ess@@ y di@@ ap@@ ers ."
"So b@@ ab@@ ies have to at@@ tr@@ act our a@@ ffec@@ tion and our n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing , and they do ."
"And , by the way , a re@@ cent study sho@@ ws that mo@@ thers pre@@ f@@ er the sm@@ ell of the di@@ r@@ ty di@@ ap@@ ers of their own b@@ ab@@ y ."
So nature works on many le@@ vel@@ s here .
"But now , if b@@ ab@@ ies didn ’ t look the way they do — if b@@ ab@@ ies looked like this , that ’ s what we would find ad@@ or@@ able , that ’ s what we would find — we would think , o@@ h my go@@ o@@ d@@ ness , do I ever want to hu@@ g that ."
This is the stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion .
"Well now , fin@@ ally what about fun@@ n@@ y . M@@ y answer is , it ’ s the same story , the same story ."
"This is the hard one , the one that isn ’ t ob@@ vi@@ ous . That ’ s why I lea@@ ve it to the end ."
And I won ’ t be able to say too much about it .
"But you have to think ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ari@@ ly , you have to think , what hard job that has to be done — it ’ s di@@ r@@ ty work , somebody ’ s got to do it — is so important to give us such a po@@ wer@@ ful , in@@ built re@@ ward for it when we su@@ c@@ ce@@ ed ."
"Now , I think we &apos;ve found the answer — I and a few of my colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es ."
It ’ s a neur@@ al system that ’ s wi@@ red up to re@@ ward the brain for doing a gr@@ u@@ b@@ by cl@@ eri@@ cal job .
O@@ ur bu@@ mp@@ er s@@ tic@@ ker for this view is that this is the jo@@ y of de@@ bu@@ g@@ g@@ ing .
"Now I ’ m not going to have time to sp@@ ell it all out , but I ’ ll just say that only some kinds of de@@ bu@@ g@@ g@@ ing get the re@@ ward ."
"And what we ’ re doing is we ’ re using hum@@ or as a sort of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c pro@@ be by s@@ wit@@ ching hum@@ or on and off , by tur@@ ning the kno@@ b on a jo@@ ke — now it ’ s not fun@@ n@@ y ... o@@ h , now it ’ s fun@@ ni@@ er ..@@ ."
"@@ now we ’ ll turn a little bit more ... now it ’ s not fun@@ n@@ y — in this way , we can actually learn something about the ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the brain , the fun@@ c@@ tional ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the brain ."
M@@ at@@ the@@ w H@@ ur@@ ley is the first au@@ th@@ or of this . We call it the H@@ ur@@ ley M@@ o@@ de@@ l .
"He ’ s a computer scienti@@ st , Re@@ g@@ in@@ al@@ d A@@ da@@ ms a psycho@@ logi@@ st , and there I am , and we ’ re pu@@ tting this together into a book ."
Thank you very much .
"Now , no@@ tice that the lead@@ er em@@ br@@ ac@@ es him as an equ@@ al ."
It ta@@ kes gu@@ ts to st@@ and out like that .
So a move@@ ment must be publi@@ c .
Now we &apos;ve got mom@@ en@@ tum . This is the ti@@ pp@@ ing point .
"And what a per@@ fe@@ ct place to do that , at TED ."
( Applause )
An@@ y@@ one ?
How about a moder@@ ate amount of stre@@ ss ?
Y@@ ea@@ h . M@@ e too .
But that is not my con@@ f@@ es@@ sion .
It increas@@ es the ri@@ s@@ k of everything from the common co@@ ld to car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ c@@ ular disease .
"But I have chang@@ ed my mind about stre@@ ss , and today , I want to change your@@ s ."
It &apos;s called the social stre@@ ss test .
"And un@@ be@@ kno@@ w@@ n@@ st to you , the experi@@ men@@ ter has been tra@@ ined to har@@ as@@ s you d@@ uring it ."
That guy made a mi@@ sta@@ ke .
It &apos;s getting more oxy@@ g@@ en to your brain .
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is inv@@ olved in .
It fin@@ e-@@ t@@ un@@ es your brain &apos;s social inst@@ in@@ c@@ ts .
It even makes you more w@@ il@@ ling to help and supp@@ ort the people you care about .
But my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite effec@@ t on the body is actually on the heart .
Pe@@ ople who sp@@ ent time car@@ ing for others showed ab@@ solu@@ tely no stre@@ ss@@ -@@ re@@ l@@ ated increase in d@@ ying .
"And when you cho@@ ose to view stre@@ ss in this way , you &apos;re not just getting better at stre@@ ss , you &apos;re actually making a pretty pro@@ found st@@ at@@ ement ."
You &apos;re saying that you can trust yourself to h@@ and@@ le life &apos;s chall@@ eng@@ es .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : This is kind of a@@ ma@@ zing , what you &apos;re t@@ elling us ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) N@@ ever before has the ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; I am B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh &quot; &quot; e@@ li@@ c@@ ited so much p@@ ity . ( Laughter )
"So that was an im@@ men@@ se sho@@ ck for me , and it was an im@@ men@@ se sho@@ ck for many people , but it was also something that , over the fol@@ lo@@ wing se@@ ver@@ al da@@ ys , cre@@ ated a comple@@ te poli@@ tical m@@ el@@ t@@ down in my country ."
E@@ very@@ body was b@@ la@@ m@@ ing everybody else .
That comple@@ te m@@ el@@ t@@ down was made even worse by the most tra@@ gi@@ c el@@ ement of it : le@@ vel@@ s of x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ o@@ bi@@ a and r@@ ac@@ ist ab@@ use in the stre@@ ets of B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in at a level that I have never se@@ en before in my li@@ fe@@ time .
"@@ Pe@@ ople are now talking about whether my country is be@@ coming a L@@ it@@ t@@ le Eng@@ land , or , as one of my colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es put it , whether we &apos;re about to become a 19@@ 5@@ 0s n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a the@@ me par@@ k f@@ lo@@ ating in the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) But my question is really , should we have the de@@ g@@ ree of sho@@ ck that we &apos;ve experienc@@ ed since ?"
O@@ r are there de@@ e@@ per struc@@ tur@@ al fac@@ tors that have led us to where we are today ?
So I want to take a ste@@ p back and ask two very ba@@ sic questions .
"F@@ irst , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ pres@@ ent , not just for my country , but for all of us around the world ?"
"And second , what can we do about it ?"
How should we all respon@@ d ?
"So first , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ pres@@ ent ?"
H@@ in@@ d@@ sight is a wonderful thing .
B@@ re@@ x@@ it teach@@ es us many things about our society and about societies around the world .
"The v@@ ote sp@@ li@@ t along l@@ ines of age , education , cla@@ ss and ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y ."
"@@ G@@ e@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ically , it was L@@ on@@ don and S@@ c@@ ot@@ land that most stron@@ g@@ ly comm@@ it@@ ted to being part of the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on , while in other parts of the country there was very strong am@@ bi@@ v@@ al@@ ence ."
"But more prof@@ oun@@ dly , the v@@ ote teach@@ es us something about the nature of poli@@ tics today ."
Con@@ te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary poli@@ tics is no longer just about right and left .
It &apos;s no longer just about ta@@ x and sp@@ end .
It &apos;s about glob@@ alization .
The fa@@ ult l@@ ine of con@@ te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary poli@@ tics is between those that em@@ br@@ ace glob@@ alization and those that fe@@ ar glob@@ alization .
But those ideas are ones that sign@@ i@@ f@@ y fe@@ ar and ali@@ en@@ ation .
They re@@ pres@@ ent a re@@ treat back to@@ wards nati@@ on@@ al@@ ism and b@@ ord@@ ers in ways that many of us would re@@ ject .
The b@@ lu@@ e are@@ as show Re@@ ma@@ in and the red are@@ as L@@ ea@@ ve .
It means that we need to re@@ ach out more bro@@ ad@@ ly and understand .
"In the L@@ ea@@ ve v@@ ote , a min@@ or@@ ity have pe@@ dd@@ led the poli@@ tics of fe@@ ar and h@@ at@@ red , cre@@ ating lies and mi@@ str@@ ust around , for inst@@ ance , the idea that the v@@ ote on Eu@@ rop@@ e could re@@ duce the number of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es and as@@ y@@ l@@ um@@ -@@ see@@ k@@ ers coming to Eu@@ rop@@ e , when the v@@ ote on lea@@ ving had nothing to do with im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion from outside the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on ."
But for a sign@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the L@@ ea@@ ve v@@ ot@@ ers the con@@ cer@@ n was di@@ si@@ l@@ lu@@ sion@@ ment with the poli@@ tical est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment .
This rep@@ lica@@ tes around Eu@@ rop@@ e and much of the liber@@ al democ@@ ra@@ tic world .
"We see it with the ri@@ se in pop@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity of D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ r@@ um@@ p in the United States , with the gro@@ wing nati@@ on@@ al@@ ism of V@@ i@@ k@@ tor O@@ r@@ b@@ á@@ n in H@@ un@@ g@@ ary , with the increase in pop@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity of M@@ ar@@ ine L@@ e P@@ en in F@@ r@@ ance ."
The spec@@ ter of B@@ re@@ x@@ it is in all of our societies .
"For all of us who care about cre@@ ating liber@@ al , op@@ en , t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant societies , we ur@@ g@@ ently need a new vi@@ sion , a vi@@ sion of a more t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant , in@@ clu@@ sive glob@@ alization , one that br@@ ings people with us rather than lea@@ ving them be@@ h@@ ind ."
That vi@@ sion of glob@@ alization is one that has to start by a recogn@@ ition of the pos@@ itive bene@@ f@@ its of glob@@ alization .
"The con@@ sen@@ su@@ s a@@ mon@@ g@@ st econom@@ ist@@ s is that f@@ ree tra@@ de , the move@@ ment of cap@@ ital , the move@@ ment of people across b@@ ord@@ ers bene@@ f@@ it everyone on ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate ."
But glob@@ alization also has re@@ dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tive effec@@ ts .
It cre@@ ates w@@ in@@ n@@ ers and l@@ os@@ ers .
"In 200@@ 2 , the form@@ er S@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ar@@ y-@@ G@@ ener@@ al of the United N@@ ations , K@@ o@@ f@@ i An@@ n@@ an , gave a spe@@ ec@@ h at Y@@ ale Uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , and that spe@@ ec@@ h was on the t@@ op@@ ic of in@@ clu@@ sive glob@@ alization ."
That was the spe@@ ec@@ h in which he co@@ ined that ter@@ m .
"But a@@ mi@@ d au@@ ster@@ ity and the fin@@ an@@ cial cri@@ s@@ is of 200@@ 8 , the con@@ cept dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed almost without a tr@@ ace ."
G@@ lob@@ alization has been taken to supp@@ ort a ne@@ o@@ liber@@ al ag@@ end@@ a .
It &apos;s per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved to be part of an e@@ li@@ te ag@@ end@@ a rather than something that bene@@ f@@ its all .
How can we bal@@ ance on the one hand ad@@ dre@@ ss@@ ing fe@@ ar and ali@@ en@@ ation while on the other hand re@@ f@@ using ve@@ he@@ m@@ ently to give in to x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ o@@ bi@@ a and nati@@ on@@ al@@ ism ?
That is the question for all of us .
"And I think , as a social scienti@@ st , that social science off@@ ers some pl@@ ac@@ es to start ."
"O@@ ur trans@@ formation has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a star@@ ting point ."
The first re@@ l@@ ates to the idea of ci@@ vi@@ c education .
What st@@ ands out from B@@ re@@ x@@ it is the ga@@ p between publi@@ c per@@ cep@@ tion and emp@@ i@@ ri@@ cal reality .
So how can we — ( Applause ) How can we re@@ build re@@ spe@@ ct for tru@@ th and evi@@ dence into our liber@@ al democ@@ r@@ ac@@ ies ?
"It has to beg@@ in with education , but it has to start with the recogn@@ ition that there are hu@@ ge g@@ aps ."
The second thing that I think is an op@@ p@@ ort@@ unity is the idea to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge more inter@@ action across di@@ verse comm@@ uni@@ ties .
"So for inst@@ ance , L@@ on@@ don and the S@@ ou@@ the@@ a@@ st have the high@@ est numbers of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts , and they are also by far the most t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant are@@ as ."
It &apos;s those are@@ as of the country that have the lo@@ we@@ st le@@ vel@@ s of im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion that actually are the most ex@@ clu@@ sion@@ ary and int@@ ol@@ er@@ ant to@@ wards mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts .
This il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tion from the F@@ in@@ an@@ cial T@@ im@@ es pos@@ t@@ -@@ B@@ re@@ x@@ it is really stri@@ king .
The f@@ our@@ th and fin@@ al idea I want to put for@@ ward is an idea that we need more respon@@ sible poli@@ tics .
There &apos;s very little social science evi@@ dence that com@@ par@@ es at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des on glob@@ alization .
I am still B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh .
I am still Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an .
I am still a global ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en .
"For those of us who believe that our i@@ d@@ enti@@ ties are not mu@@ tually ex@@ clu@@ sive , we have to all work together to en@@ s@@ ure that glob@@ alization ta@@ kes everyone with us and doesn &apos;t lea@@ ve people be@@ h@@ ind ."
O@@ n@@ ly then will we tru@@ ly re@@ con@@ ci@@ le democ@@ r@@ acy and glob@@ alization .
Thank you .
Thank you .
It &apos;s a real ple@@ as@@ ure to be here .
I last did a TED T@@ al@@ k I think about se@@ ven years ago or so .
I tal@@ ked about sp@@ a@@ gh@@ e@@ tt@@ i sa@@ u@@ ce .
"And so many people , I gu@@ ess , wat@@ ch those vi@@ de@@ os ."
"@@ Pe@@ ople have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about sp@@ a@@ gh@@ e@@ tt@@ i sa@@ u@@ ce , which is a wonderful thing in the sh@@ ort ter@@ m — ( Laughter ) but it &apos;s pro@@ ven to be less than ide@@ al over se@@ ven years ."
And so I though I would come and try and put sp@@ a@@ gh@@ e@@ tt@@ i sa@@ u@@ ce be@@ h@@ ind me .
( Laughter ) The the@@ me of this mor@@ ning &apos;s se@@ s@@ sion is Th@@ ings We Ma@@ ke .
And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most preci@@ ous ob@@ jec@@ ts of his er@@ a .
And the man &apos;s na@@ me is C@@ ar@@ l Norden .
C@@ ar@@ l Norden was born in 18@@ 80 .
And he was S@@ wi@@ ss .
"And of course , the S@@ wi@@ ss can be divi@@ ded into two gener@@ al ca@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies : those who make small , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite , exp@@ en@@ sive ob@@ jec@@ ts and those who h@@ and@@ le the money of those who buy small , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite , exp@@ en@@ sive ob@@ jec@@ ts ."
And C@@ ar@@ l Norden is very fir@@ m@@ ly in the form@@ er ca@@ m@@ p .
He &apos;s an engine@@ er .
He goes to the F@@ ed@@ er@@ al P@@ ol@@ y@@ te@@ ch in Z@@ u@@ rich .
"In fact , one of his cla@@ ss@@ mat@@ es is a young man n@@ am@@ ed L@@ en@@ in who would go on to brea@@ k small , exp@@ en@@ sive , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite ob@@ jec@@ ts ."
"And he &apos;s a S@@ wi@@ ss engine@@ er , C@@ ar@@ l ."
And I mean that in its ful@@ le@@ st sense of the word .
"He w@@ ear@@ s thre@@ e-@@ piece su@@ its ; and he has a very , very small , important mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he ; and he is dom@@ ine@@ ering and n@@ ar@@ ci@@ s@@ si@@ s@@ tic and dri@@ ven and has an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary e@@ go ; and he works 1@@ 6@@ -@@ h@@ our da@@ ys ; and he has very strong feel@@ ings about al@@ ter@@ n@@ ating cur@@ r@@ ent ; and he feel@@ s like a s@@ un@@ t@@ an is a si@@ gn of moral we@@ a@@ k@@ ness ; and he dr@@ in@@ ks lots of co@@ ff@@ e@@ e ; and he does his best work s@@ it@@ ting in his mother &apos;s k@@ it@@ ch@@ en in Z@@ u@@ rich for h@@ ours in comple@@ te si@@ l@@ ence with nothing but a sli@@ de ru@@ le ."
"In any case , C@@ ar@@ l Norden e@@ mi@@ gr@@ ates to the United States just before the F@@ irst World War and se@@ ts up sho@@ p on L@@ a@@ fa@@ ye@@ tt@@ e S@@ tre@@ et in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an ."
And he be@@ comes ob@@ se@@ ss@@ ed with the question of how to dro@@ p bomb@@ s from an a@@ ir@@ plan@@ e .
"Now if you think about it , in the age before G@@ P@@ S and ra@@ d@@ ar , that was ob@@ vi@@ ously a really difficult problem ."
It &apos;s a comp@@ lica@@ ted physics problem .
"You &apos;ve got a plan@@ e that &apos;s thousands of fe@@ et up in the air , going at hund@@ re@@ ds of mil@@ es an h@@ our , and you &apos;re trying to dro@@ p an ob@@ ject , a bom@@ b , to@@ wards some st@@ ati@@ on@@ ary t@@ ar@@ get in the face of all kinds of w@@ in@@ ds and cl@@ ou@@ d co@@ ver and all kinds of other im@@ pe@@ di@@ ments ."
"And all s@@ orts of people , mo@@ ving up to the F@@ irst World War and between the war@@ s , tried to sol@@ ve this problem , and ne@@ arly everybody came up sh@@ ort ."
The bomb@@ si@@ ghts that were a@@ va@@ il@@ able were incredi@@ b@@ ly c@@ ru@@ de .
But C@@ ar@@ l Norden is really the one who c@@ r@@ ac@@ ks the co@@ de .
And he comes up with this incredi@@ b@@ ly comp@@ lica@@ ted de@@ v@@ ice .
It we@@ i@@ gh@@ s about 50 l@@ b@@ s .
It &apos;s called the Norden M@@ ark 15 bombsight .
And it has all kinds of le@@ ver@@ s and b@@ all@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ings and g@@ ad@@ gets and g@@ au@@ g@@ es .
And he makes this comp@@ lica@@ ted thing .
"And what he allo@@ ws people to do is he makes the bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ er take this particular ob@@ ject , vi@@ su@@ ally sight the t@@ ar@@ get , because they &apos;re in the P@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ g@@ l@@ as con@@ e of the bom@@ ber , and then they pl@@ u@@ g in the al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the w@@ ind and the co@@ ordin@@ ates of the t@@ ar@@ get ."
And the bombsight will tell him when to dro@@ p the bom@@ b .
"And as Norden fa@@ m@@ ously says , &quot; &quot; Be@@ fore that bombsight came along , bomb@@ s would r@@ out@@ in@@ ely mi@@ ss their t@@ ar@@ get by a mi@@ le or more . &quot; &quot; But he said , with the M@@ ark 15 Norden bombsight , he could dro@@ p a bom@@ b into a pic@@ k@@ le b@@ ar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft ."
Now I cannot tell you how incredi@@ b@@ ly exc@@ ited the U.S@@ . mi@@ lit@@ ary was by the news of the Norden bombsight .
It was like man@@ n@@ a from he@@ a@@ ven .
"@@ Here was an ar@@ my that had just had experience in the F@@ irst World War , where m@@ illions of men f@@ ought each other in the tr@@ en@@ ch@@ es , getting no@@ where , making no progre@@ ss , and here someone had come up with a de@@ v@@ ice that allowed them to f@@ ly up in the sk@@ ies high ab@@ ove ene@@ my ter@@ r@@ it@@ ory and de@@ stro@@ y wh@@ at@@ ever they wanted with p@@ in@@ point ac@@ cur@@ acy ."
And the U.S@@ . mi@@ lit@@ ary sp@@ ends 1@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars — billion dollars in 19@@ 40 dollars — develop@@ ing the Norden bombsight .
"And to put that in per@@ spec@@ tive , the t@@ ot@@ al cost of the M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an pro@@ ject was three billion dollars ."
H@@ al@@ f as much money was sp@@ ent on this Norden bombsight as was sp@@ ent on the most fa@@ m@@ ous mi@@ lit@@ ar@@ y-@@ in@@ du@@ stri@@ al pro@@ ject of the modern er@@ a .
"And there were people , str@@ at@@ e@@ gi@@ sts , within the U.S@@ . mi@@ lit@@ ary who gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely thought that this single de@@ v@@ ice was going to sp@@ ell the difference between de@@ fe@@ at and vic@@ t@@ ory when it came to the b@@ att@@ le against the N@@ a@@ z@@ is and against the Jap@@ an@@ ese ."
"And for Norden as well , this de@@ v@@ ice had incredi@@ ble moral import@@ ance , because Norden was a comm@@ it@@ ted Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an ."
"In fact , he would always get up@@ set when people re@@ fer@@ red to the bombsight as his inv@@ en@@ tion , because in his ey@@ es , only G@@ od could inv@@ ent things ."
He was simply the in@@ str@@ ument of G@@ od &apos;s will .
And what was G@@ od &apos;s will ?
Well G@@ od &apos;s will was that the amount of suff@@ ering in any kind of war be re@@ duc@@ ed to as small an amount as possible .
And what did the Norden bombsight do ?
Well it allowed you to do that .
It allowed you to bom@@ b only those things that you ab@@ solu@@ tely needed and wanted to bom@@ b .
"So in the years lead@@ ing up to the S@@ econ@@ d World War , the U.S@@ . mi@@ lit@@ ary bu@@ ys 9@@ 0,000 of these Norden bomb@@ si@@ ghts at a cost of $ 1@@ 4@@ ,000 each — again , in 19@@ 40 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money ."
"And they tra@@ ined 5@@ 0,000 bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers on how to use them — long ex@@ ten@@ sive , mon@@ th@@ s@@ -@@ long tra@@ ining se@@ s@@ sions — because these things are essenti@@ ally an@@ al@@ o@@ g compu@@ ters ; they &apos;re not easy to use ."
"And they make every one of those bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers take an o@@ ath , to swe@@ ar that if they &apos;re ever cap@@ tu@@ red , they will not di@@ v@@ ul@@ ge a single deta@@ il of this particular de@@ v@@ ice to the ene@@ my , because it &apos;s im@@ per@@ ative the ene@@ my not get their h@@ ands on this ab@@ solu@@ tely essenti@@ al piece of technology ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever the Norden bombsight is taken on@@ to a plan@@ e , it &apos;s es@@ cor@@ ted there by a ser@@ ies of ar@@ m@@ ed gu@@ ar@@ ds ."
And it &apos;s car@@ ri@@ ed in a bo@@ x with a can@@ v@@ as sh@@ r@@ ou@@ d over it .
And the bo@@ x is h@@ and@@ cu@@ ff@@ ed to one of the gu@@ ar@@ ds .
It &apos;s never allowed to be ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ed .
"And there &apos;s a little in@@ cen@@ di@@ ary de@@ v@@ ice inside of it , so that , if the plan@@ e ever c@@ ra@@ sh@@ es , it will be de@@ stro@@ y@@ ed and there &apos;s no way the ene@@ my can ever get their h@@ ands on it ."
The Norden bombsight is the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il .
So what happens d@@ uring the S@@ econ@@ d World War ?
"Well , it turns out it &apos;s not the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il ."
"In pr@@ ac@@ tice , the Norden bombsight can dro@@ p a bom@@ b into a pic@@ k@@ le b@@ ar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . , but that &apos;s under per@@ fe@@ ct con@@ di@@ tions ."
"And of course , in war@@ time , con@@ di@@ tions ar@@ en &apos;t per@@ fe@@ ct ."
"F@@ irst of all , it &apos;s really hard to use — really hard to use ."
"And not all of the people who are of those 5@@ 0,000 men who are bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers have the ab@@ i@@ lity to pro@@ per@@ ly progra@@ m an an@@ al@@ o@@ g computer ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , it brea@@ ks down a lot ."
"It &apos;s ful@@ l of all kinds of g@@ y@@ ros@@ cop@@ es and pul@@ le@@ ys and g@@ ad@@ gets and b@@ all@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ings , and they don &apos;t work as well as they ought to in the he@@ at of b@@ att@@ le ."
"Th@@ ir@@ dly , when Norden was making his cal@@ c@@ ula@@ tions , he as@@ su@@ m@@ ed that a plan@@ e would be fl@@ ying at a rela@@ tively s@@ low spe@@ ed at low al@@ ti@@ tu@@ des ."
"Well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get sho@@ t down ."
So they started fl@@ ying them at high al@@ ti@@ tu@@ des at incredi@@ b@@ ly high spe@@ e@@ ds .
And the Norden bombsight doesn &apos;t work as well under those con@@ di@@ tions .
"But most of all , the Norden bombsight re@@ qui@@ red the bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ er to make vi@@ su@@ al cont@@ act with the t@@ ar@@ get ."
"But of course , what happens in real life ?"
"There are cl@@ ou@@ ds , right ."
It ne@@ e@@ ds cl@@ ou@@ d@@ less sk@@ y to be really ac@@ cur@@ ate .
Well how many cl@@ ou@@ d@@ less sk@@ ies do you think there were ab@@ ove C@@ en@@ tr@@ al Eu@@ rop@@ e between 19@@ 40 and 19@@ 45 ?
No@@ t a lot .
"And then to give you a sense of just how in@@ ac@@ cur@@ ate the Norden bombsight was , there was a fa@@ m@@ ous case in 19@@ 4@@ 4 where the A@@ l@@ lies bomb@@ ed a che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant in L@@ e@@ un@@ a , G@@ er@@ many ."
And the che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant comp@@ ri@@ sed 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ res .
"And over the course of 2@@ 2 bomb@@ ing mis@@ sions , the A@@ l@@ lies dro@@ pp@@ ed 8@@ 5@@ ,000 bomb@@ s on this 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ re che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant , using the Norden bombsight ."
Well what per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of those bomb@@ s do you think actually l@@ and@@ ed inside the 7@@ 00@@ -@@ ac@@ re peri@@ me@@ ter of the pl@@ ant ?
10 percent . 10 percent .
"And of those 10 percent that l@@ and@@ ed , 1@@ 6 percent didn &apos;t even go off ; they were du@@ ds ."
"The L@@ e@@ un@@ a che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant , after one of the most ex@@ ten@@ sive bomb@@ ings in the history of the war , was up and run@@ ning within wee@@ ks ."
"And by the way , all those pre@@ ca@@ u@@ tions to keep the Norden bombsight out of the h@@ ands of the N@@ a@@ z@@ is ?"
"Well it turns out that C@@ ar@@ l Norden , as a pro@@ per S@@ wi@@ ss , was very en@@ a@@ mo@@ red of G@@ er@@ man engine@@ ers ."
"So in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , he hi@@ red a whole b@@ un@@ ch of them , in@@ clu@@ ding a man n@@ am@@ ed H@@ er@@ man@@ n L@@ ong who , in 19@@ 3@@ 8 , gave a comple@@ te set of the pl@@ ans for the Norden bombsight to the N@@ a@@ z@@ is ."
"So they had their own Norden bombsight thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the enti@@ re war — which also , by the way , didn &apos;t work very well ."
( Laughter ) So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight ?
Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bomb@@ si@@ ghts .
"We live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really s@@ mar@@ t people run@@ ning around , saying that they &apos;ve inv@@ en@@ ted g@@ ad@@ gets that will fore@@ ver change our world ."
They &apos;ve inv@@ en@@ ted we@@ b@@ s@@ it@@ es that will all@@ ow people to be f@@ ree .
"They &apos;ve inv@@ en@@ ted some kind of this thing , or this thing , or this thing that will make our world fore@@ ver better ."
"If you go into the mi@@ lit@@ ary , you &apos;ll find lots of C@@ ar@@ l Nord@@ ens as well ."
"If you go to the P@@ en@@ ta@@ g@@ on , they will say , &quot; &quot; You know what , now we really can put a bom@@ b inside a pic@@ k@@ le b@@ ar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . &quot; &quot; And you know what , it &apos;s true ; they actually can do that now ."
But we need to be very c@@ lear about how little that means .
"In the I@@ ra@@ q War , at the beginning of the first I@@ ra@@ q War , the U.S@@ . mi@@ lit@@ ary , the air force , s@@ ent two s@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ons of F@@ -@@ 1@@ 5@@ E F@@ i@@ ghter E@@ ag@@ les to the I@@ ra@@ q@@ i de@@ ser@@ t equ@@ i@@ pp@@ ed with these five million dol@@ lar ca@@ mer@@ as that allowed them to see the enti@@ re de@@ ser@@ t f@@ lo@@ or ."
"And their mis@@ sion was to find and to de@@ stro@@ y — remem@@ ber the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ si@@ le la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers , those sur@@ fac@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ air mis@@ si@@ les that the I@@ ra@@ q@@ is were la@@ un@@ ching at the I@@ s@@ ra@@ el@@ is ?"
The mis@@ sion of the two s@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ons was to get ri@@ d of all the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ si@@ le la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers .
"And so they f@@ le@@ w mis@@ sions day and ni@@ ght , and they dro@@ pp@@ ed thousands of bomb@@ s , and they fi@@ red thousands of mis@@ si@@ les in an at@@ te@@ mp@@ t to get ri@@ d of this particular s@@ cour@@ ge ."
"And after the war was over , there was an au@@ d@@ it done — as the ar@@ my always does , the air force always does — and they asked the question : how many S@@ cu@@ ds did we actually de@@ stro@@ y ?"
You know what the answer was ?
"@@ Z@@ er@@ o , not a single one ."
Now why is that ?
I@@ s it because their we@@ ap@@ ons wer@@ en &apos;t ac@@ cur@@ ate ?
"O@@ h no , they were bri@@ l@@ li@@ an@@ tly ac@@ cur@@ ate ."
"They could have de@@ stro@@ y@@ ed this little thing right here from 2@@ 5@@ ,000 ft ."
The is@@ sue was they didn &apos;t know where the S@@ cu@@ d la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers were .
"The problem with bomb@@ s and pic@@ k@@ le b@@ ar@@ re@@ ls is not getting the bom@@ b inside the pic@@ k@@ le b@@ ar@@ re@@ l , it &apos;s kno@@ wing how to find the pic@@ k@@ le b@@ ar@@ re@@ l ."
That &apos;s always been the har@@ der problem when it comes to fi@@ gh@@ ting war@@ s .
O@@ r take the b@@ att@@ le in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan .
What is the sign@@ ature we@@ ap@@ on of the C@@ I@@ A &apos;s war in N@@ or@@ th@@ we@@ st P@@ a@@ k@@ istan ?
It &apos;s the dr@@ one . What is the dr@@ one ?
Well it is the grand@@ son of the Norden M@@ ark 15 bombsight .
It is this we@@ ap@@ on of de@@ va@@ st@@ ating ac@@ cur@@ acy and preci@@ sion .
"And over the course of the last six years in N@@ or@@ th@@ we@@ st P@@ a@@ k@@ istan , the C@@ I@@ A has f@@ lo@@ wn hund@@ re@@ ds of dr@@ one mis@@ si@@ les , and it &apos;s used those dr@@ ones to k@@ ill 2@@ ,000 su@@ spec@@ ted P@@ a@@ k@@ ist@@ an@@ i and T@@ ali@@ b@@ an mi@@ lit@@ an@@ ts ."
Now what is the ac@@ cur@@ acy of those dr@@ ones ?
Well it &apos;s ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary .
We think we &apos;re now at 9@@ 5 percent ac@@ cur@@ acy when it comes to dr@@ one stri@@ kes .
"@@ 9@@ 5 percent of the people we k@@ ill need to be k@@ il@@ led , right ?"
That is one of the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary rec@@ or@@ ds in the history of modern war@@ f@@ are .
But do you know what the c@@ ru@@ cial thing is ?
"In that ex@@ act same peri@@ od that we &apos;ve been using these dr@@ ones with de@@ va@@ st@@ ating ac@@ cur@@ acy , the number of att@@ ac@@ ks , of su@@ ici@@ de att@@ ac@@ ks and ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st att@@ ac@@ ks , against American for@@ ces in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan has increas@@ ed ten@@ f@@ old ."
"As we have g@@ ot@@ ten more and more e@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent in k@@ il@@ ling them , they have become ang@@ ri@@ er and ang@@ ri@@ er and more and more mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated to k@@ ill us ."
I have not describ@@ ed to you a success story .
I &apos;ve describ@@ ed to you the op@@ pos@@ ite of a success story .
And this is the problem with our in@@ f@@ at@@ u@@ ation with the things we make .
"We think the things we make can sol@@ ve our problems , but our problems are much more comple@@ x than that ."
"The is@@ sue isn &apos;t the ac@@ cur@@ acy of the bomb@@ s you have , it &apos;s how you use the bomb@@ s you have , and more import@@ an@@ tly , whether you ought to use bomb@@ s at all ."
There &apos;s a pos@@ t@@ scri@@ p@@ t to the Norden story of C@@ ar@@ l Norden and his f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous bombsight .
"And that is , on A@@ u@@ g@@ ust 6 , 19@@ 45 , a B@@ -@@ 2@@ 9 bom@@ ber called the E@@ no@@ l@@ a G@@ ay f@@ le@@ w over Japan and , using a Norden bombsight , dro@@ pp@@ ed a very lar@@ ge ther@@ mon@@ uc@@ lear de@@ v@@ ice on the c@@ ity of H@@ ir@@ os@@ hi@@ m@@ a ."
"And as was t@@ y@@ pi@@ cal with the Norden bombsight , the bom@@ b actually mi@@ ss@@ ed its t@@ ar@@ get by 8@@ 00 ft ."
"But of course , it didn &apos;t matter ."
And that &apos;s the gre@@ at@@ est ir@@ on@@ y of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight .
"@@ the air force &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 5 billion dol@@ lar bombsight was used to dro@@ p its three billion dol@@ lar bom@@ b , which didn &apos;t need a bombsight at all ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , back in New Y@@ or@@ k , no one told C@@ ar@@ l Norden that his bombsight was used over H@@ ir@@ os@@ hi@@ m@@ a ."
He was a comm@@ it@@ ted Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an .
He thought he had de@@ sign@@ ed something that would re@@ duce the t@@ ol@@ l of suff@@ ering in war .
It would have bro@@ ken his heart .

"( Applause ) M@@ al@@ al@@ a started her ca@@ mp@@ a@@ i@@ gn for education and st@@ ood for her ri@@ ghts in 200@@ 7 , and when her e@@ ff@@ orts were hon@@ o@@ red in 20@@ 1@@ 1 , and she was gi@@ ven the national y@@ ou@@ th pe@@ ace pri@@ ze , and she be@@ came a very fa@@ m@@ ous , very pop@@ ular young girl of her country ."

"You see , in pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ c@@ ha@@ l societies , right from the very beginning , when a girl is born , her b@@ ir@@ th is not c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ated ."
"She is not w@@ el@@ com@@ ed , ne@@ i@@ ther by father n@@ or by mother ."
"The ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood comes and com@@ mi@@ ser@@ ates with the mother , and no@@ body con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ates the father ."
And a mother is very un@@ com@@ for@@ table for having a girl child .
"When she gi@@ ves b@@ ir@@ th to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sa@@ d ."
"When she gi@@ ves b@@ ir@@ th to the second daughter , she is sho@@ c@@ ked , and in the expe@@ c@@ ta@@ tion of a son , when she gi@@ ves b@@ ir@@ th to a th@@ ir@@ d daughter , she feel@@ s gu@@ il@@ ty like a cri@@ min@@ al ."
"@@ No@@ t only the mother suff@@ ers , but the daughter , the ne@@ w@@ ly born daughter , when she gro@@ ws old , she suff@@ ers too ."
"A@@ t the age of five , while she should be going to school , she sta@@ ys at home and her bro@@ thers are ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted in a school ."
She can have fu@@ n .
"She can pl@@ ay with her fri@@ ends in the stre@@ ets , and she can move around in the stre@@ ets like a bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ ly ."
"But when she en@@ ters her te@@ ens , when she be@@ comes 1@@ 3 years old , she is for@@ bi@@ dd@@ en to go out of her home without a m@@ ale es@@ c@@ ort ."
She is con@@ fin@@ ed under the four w@@ all@@ s of her home .
She is no more a f@@ ree in@@ divi@@ du@@ al .
"She be@@ comes the so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or of her father and of her bro@@ thers and of her family , and if she trans@@ gre@@ ss@@ es the co@@ de of that so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or , she could even be k@@ il@@ led ."
"So this bro@@ ther , he s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ es the jo@@ ys of his life and the happiness of his sist@@ ers at the al@@ ta@@ r of so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or ."
"A good girl is supp@@ osed to be very qui@@ et , very hum@@ ble and very sub@@ mis@@ sive ."
It is the c@@ r@@ it@@ eri@@ a .
The ro@@ le mo@@ de@@ l good girl should be very qui@@ et .
"She is supp@@ osed to be si@@ l@@ ent and she is supp@@ osed to ac@@ cept the deci@@ sions of her father and mother and the deci@@ sions of el@@ d@@ ers , even if she does not like them ."
"If she is marri@@ ed to a man she doesn &apos;t like or if she is marri@@ ed to an old man , she has to ac@@ cept , because she does not want to be du@@ b@@ b@@ ed as di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ent ."
"If she is marri@@ ed very early , she has to ac@@ cept ."
"O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , she will be called di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ent ."
And what happens at the end ?
"In the words of a po@@ et@@ ess , she is wed@@ ded , be@@ d@@ ded , and then she gi@@ ves b@@ ir@@ th to more s@@ ons and d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters ."
"And it is the ir@@ on@@ y of the s@@ it@@ u@@ ation that this mother , she teach@@ es the same le@@ s@@ son of o@@ be@@ di@@ ence to her daughter and the same le@@ s@@ son of hon@@ or to her s@@ ons ."
"And this vic@@ i@@ ous c@@ y@@ c@@ le goes on , goes on ."
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and sist@@ ers , when M@@ al@@ al@@ a was born , and for the first time , believe me , I don &apos;t like ne@@ w@@ born children , to be hon@@ est , but when I went and I looked into her ey@@ es , believe me , I got extre@@ me@@ ly hon@@ o@@ red ."
"And long before she was born , I thought about her na@@ me , and I was f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated with a her@@ o@@ ic le@@ g@@ end@@ ary fre@@ e@@ dom fi@@ ghter in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan ."
"H@@ er na@@ me was M@@ al@@ ala@@ i of Ma@@ i@@ w@@ and , and I n@@ am@@ ed my daughter after her ."
"A few da@@ ys after M@@ al@@ al@@ a was born , my daughter was born , my cou@@ s@@ in came — and it was a co@@ inci@@ dence — he came to my home and he br@@ ought a family t@@ ree , a family t@@ ree of the Y@@ ou@@ sa@@ f@@ z@@ a@@ i family , and when I looked at the family t@@ ree , it tr@@ ac@@ ed back to 3@@ 00 years of our an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors ."
"But when I looked , all were men , and I pic@@ ked my p@@ en , dre@@ w a l@@ ine from my na@@ me , and wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ al@@ a . &quot; &quot; And when she grow old , when she was four and a half years old , I ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted her in my school ."
"You will be asking , then , why should I men@@ tion about the ad@@ mis@@ sion of a girl in a school ?"
"@@ Y@@ es , I must men@@ tion it ."
"It may be taken for gr@@ an@@ ted in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , in America , in many developed countries , but in poor countries , in pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ c@@ ha@@ l societies , in tri@@ b@@ al societies , it &apos;s a big ev@@ ent for the life of girl ."
En@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ ment in a school means recogn@@ ition of her i@@ d@@ enti@@ ty and her na@@ me .
A@@ d@@ mis@@ sion in a school means that she has en@@ ter@@ ed the world of dre@@ a@@ ms and as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions where she can expl@@ ore her p@@ ot@@ enti@@ als for her future life .
"I have five sist@@ ers , and n@@ one of them could go to school , and you will be a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ shed , two wee@@ ks before , when I was fil@@ ling out the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an vi@@ s@@ a form , and I was fil@@ ling out the family part of the form , I could not rec@@ all the sur@@ n@@ am@@ es of some of my sist@@ ers ."
That was the reason that I valu@@ ed my daughter .
"What my father could not give to my sist@@ ers and to his d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters , I thought I must change it ."
I used to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate the intellig@@ ence and the bri@@ l@@ li@@ ance of my daughter .
I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed her to s@@ it with me when my fri@@ ends used to come .
I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed her to go with me to different me@@ et@@ ings .
"And all these good valu@@ es , I tried to in@@ cul@@ ca@@ te in her per@@ s@@ on@@ ality ."
"And this was not only she , only M@@ al@@ al@@ a ."
"I imp@@ ar@@ ted all these good valu@@ es to my school , girl students and bo@@ y students as well ."
I used education for e@@ man@@ ci@@ p@@ ation .
"I ta@@ u@@ ght my girls , I ta@@ u@@ ght my girl students , to un@@ learn the le@@ s@@ son of o@@ be@@ di@@ ence ."
I ta@@ u@@ ght my bo@@ y students to un@@ learn the le@@ s@@ son of so@@ -@@ called p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ hon@@ or .
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and sist@@ ers , we were stri@@ ving for more ri@@ ghts for women , and we were str@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling to have more , more and more space for the women in society ."
But we came across a new ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
It was le@@ th@@ al to human ri@@ ghts and partic@@ ul@@ arly to women &apos;s ri@@ ghts .
It was called T@@ ali@@ b@@ an@@ iz@@ ation .
"It means a comple@@ te ne@@ g@@ ation of women &apos;s par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation in all poli@@ tical , econom@@ i@@ cal and social acti@@ vi@@ ties ."
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of scho@@ ols were l@@ ost .
G@@ ir@@ ls were pro@@ hi@@ b@@ ited from going to school .
W@@ om@@ en were for@@ c@@ ed to we@@ ar ve@@ il@@ s and they were st@@ op@@ p@@ ed from going to the marke@@ ts .
"M@@ u@@ si@@ ci@@ ans were si@@ l@@ enc@@ ed , girls were f@@ lo@@ g@@ g@@ ed and sing@@ ers were k@@ il@@ led ."
"She wr@@ ote a di@@ ary for the B@@ B@@ C b@@ lo@@ g , she v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed her@@ self for the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ar@@ ies , and she sp@@ o@@ ke from every pl@@ at@@ form she could ."
And her vo@@ ice was the most po@@ wer@@ ful vo@@ ice .
It sp@@ read like a cre@@ sc@@ en@@ do all around the world .
"And that was the reason the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an could not t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate her ca@@ mp@@ a@@ i@@ gn , and on O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 9 20@@ 12 , she was sho@@ t in the head at point bl@@ ank ran@@ ge ."
It was a do@@ om@@ s@@ day for my family and for me .
The world turned into a big black h@@ ole .
"Wh@@ ile my daughter was on the ver@@ ge of life and de@@ ath , I wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of my wi@@ fe , &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ould I be b@@ la@@ m@@ ed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter ? &quot; &quot; And she ab@@ ru@@ p@@ tly told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase don &apos;t b@@ la@@ me yourself ."
You st@@ ood for the right cause .
"You put your life at sta@@ ke for the cause of tru@@ th , for the cause of pe@@ ace , and for the cause of education , and your daughter in in@@ sp@@ i@@ red from you and she jo@@ ined you ."
"You both were on the right p@@ ath and G@@ od will pr@@ ot@@ ec@@ t her . &quot; &quot; These few words me@@ ant a lot to me , and I didn &apos;t ask this question again ."
"When M@@ al@@ al@@ a was in the h@@ os@@ p@@ ital , and she was going through the se@@ v@@ ere pa@@ ins and she had had se@@ v@@ ere he@@ ad@@ ach@@ es because her fac@@ i@@ al ner@@ ve was c@@ ut down , I used to see a dark s@@ ha@@ d@@ ow sp@@ read@@ ing on the face of my wi@@ fe ."
But my daughter never comp@@ la@@ ined .
"She used to tell us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m f@@ ine with my c@@ ro@@ o@@ ked s@@ mi@@ le and with my num@@ b@@ ness in my face ."
"I &apos;ll be o@@ kay . P@@ le@@ ase don &apos;t wor@@ ry . &quot; &quot; She was a sol@@ ace for us , and she con@@ sol@@ ed us ."
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and sist@@ ers , we learned from her how to be re@@ si@@ li@@ ent in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m g@@ la@@ d to share with you that de@@ sp@@ ite being an ic@@ on for the ri@@ ghts of children and women , she is like any 1@@ 6@@ -@@ year old girl ."
She cri@@ es when her h@@ ome@@ work is in@@ comple@@ te .
"She qu@@ ar@@ re@@ ls with her bro@@ thers , and I am very happy for that ."
"@@ Pe@@ ople ask me , what spe@@ cial is in my m@@ ent@@ or@@ ship which has made M@@ al@@ al@@ a so bo@@ ld and so cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous and so vo@@ cal and po@@ ised ?"
"I tell them , don &apos;t ask me what I did ."
A@@ s@@ k me what I did not do .
"I did not c@@ li@@ p her w@@ ings , and that &apos;s all ."

I &apos;m going to talk to you today about hop@@ e@@ fully con@@ ver@@ ting fe@@ ar into hop@@ e .
"When we go to the phy@@ si@@ ci@@ an today — when we go to the doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice and we wal@@ k in , there are words that we just don &apos;t want to hear ."
There are words that we &apos;re tru@@ ly af@@ ra@@ id of .
"D@@ i@@ a@@ bet@@ es , c@@ anc@@ er , P@@ ar@@ kin@@ son &apos;s , A@@ l@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s , heart fa@@ il@@ ure , l@@ un@@ g fa@@ il@@ ure — things that we know are de@@ bi@@ lit@@ ating dise@@ as@@ es , for which there &apos;s rela@@ tively little that can be done ."
"And what I want to l@@ ay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat de@@ bi@@ lit@@ ating disease , why it &apos;s important , why without it perhaps our health care system will m@@ el@@ t down if you think it already ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t , and where we are cl@@ in@@ ically today , and where we might go tom@@ or@@ row , and what some of the h@@ ur@@ d@@ les are ."
"And we &apos;re going to do all of that in 1@@ 8 minutes , I pr@@ om@@ ise ."
"I want to start with this sli@@ de , because this sli@@ de sort of t@@ ells the story the way S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ aga@@ z@@ ine thin@@ ks of it ."
This was an is@@ sue from 200@@ 2 that they published with a lot of different ar@@ tic@@ les on the bi@@ on@@ ic human .
It was ba@@ sically a re@@ gener@@ ative medicine is@@ sue .
Re@@ gener@@ ative medicine is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly simple con@@ cept that everybody can understand .
It &apos;s simply acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating the p@@ ace at which the body he@@ als itself to a cl@@ in@@ ically rele@@ v@@ ant tim@@ es@@ cal@@ e .
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .
"We know that if we have a da@@ mag@@ ed hi@@ p , you can put an arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al hi@@ p in ."
And this is the idea that S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ aga@@ z@@ ine used on their fron@@ t co@@ ver .
This is the comple@@ te an@@ ti@@ the@@ s@@ is of re@@ gener@@ ative medicine .
This is not re@@ gener@@ ative medicine .
Re@@ gener@@ ative medicine is what B@@ usiness W@@ e@@ e@@ k put up when they did a story about re@@ gener@@ ative medicine not too long ago .
"The idea is that instead of fig@@ uring out how to a@@ me@@ li@@ or@@ ate sy@@ mp@@ t@@ oms with de@@ vic@@ es and dru@@ gs and the like — and I &apos;ll come back to that the@@ me a few times — instead of doing that , we will re@@ gener@@ ate l@@ ost fun@@ c@@ tion of the body by re@@ gener@@ ating the fun@@ c@@ tion of org@@ ans and da@@ mag@@ ed tis@@ sue ."
"So that at the end of the tre@@ at@@ ment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the tre@@ at@@ ment ."
V@@ ery few good ideas — if you ag@@ ree that this is a good idea — very few good ideas are tru@@ ly no@@ vel .
And this is just the same .
"If you look back in history , Ch@@ ar@@ les L@@ in@@ d@@ ber@@ gh , who was better known for fl@@ ying a@@ ir@@ plan@@ es , was actually one of the first people along with A@@ le@@ x@@ is C@@ ar@@ re@@ l , one of the No@@ be@@ l L@@ au@@ re@@ ates from R@@ o@@ c@@ ke@@ f@@ ell@@ er , to beg@@ in to think about , could you culture org@@ ans ?"
"And they published this book in 19@@ 3@@ 7 , where they actually beg@@ an to think about , what could you do in bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tors to grow whole org@@ ans ?"
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
I &apos;m going to share with you some of the exc@@ iting work that &apos;s going on .
"But before doing that , what I &apos;d like to do is share my de@@ pres@@ sion about the health care system and the need for this with you ."
"M@@ any of the tal@@ ks ye@@ ster@@ day tal@@ ked about impro@@ ving the qu@@ ality of life , and re@@ duc@@ ing po@@ ver@@ ty , and essenti@@ ally increas@@ ing life expe@@ c@@ t@@ anc@@ y all around the g@@ lo@@ be ."
"One of the chall@@ eng@@ es is that the ri@@ ch@@ er we are , the longer we live ."
"And the longer we live , the more exp@@ en@@ sive it is to take care of our dise@@ as@@ es as we get ol@@ der ."
This is simply the we@@ al@@ th of a country ver@@ su@@ s the percent of population over the age of 6@@ 5 .
"And you can ba@@ sically see that the ri@@ ch@@ er a country is , the ol@@ der the people are within it ."
Why is this important ?
And why is this a partic@@ ul@@ arly d@@ ra@@ ma@@ tic chall@@ en@@ ge right now ?
"If the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a bro@@ ken an@@ k@@ le every now and again , maybe a little bit of as@@ th@@ m@@ a ."
"If the average age in your country is 45 to 5@@ 5 , now the average person is looking at di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , ear@@ l@@ y-@@ on@@ set di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , heart fa@@ il@@ ure , cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y disease — things that are in@@ her@@ ently more difficult to treat , and much more exp@@ en@@ sive to treat ."
J@@ ust have a look at the de@@ mo@@ grap@@ h@@ ic@@ s in the U.S@@ . here .
"This is from &quot; &quot; The Un@@ ti@@ ed States of America . &quot; &quot; In 19@@ 30 , there were 4@@ 1 wor@@ k@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree ."
"@@ 4@@ 1 people who were ba@@ sically outside of being really sic@@ k , pa@@ ying for the one re@@ ti@@ ree who was experienc@@ ing de@@ bi@@ lit@@ ating disease ."
"In 20@@ 10 , two wor@@ k@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree in the U.S@@ ."
"And this is mat@@ ched in every in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized , we@@ al@@ thy country in the world ."
How can you actually a@@ ff@@ or@@ d to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?
This is age ver@@ su@@ s cost of health care .
"And you can see that right around age 45 , 40 to 45 , there &apos;s a su@@ dd@@ en sp@@ i@@ ke in the cost of health care ."
"It &apos;s actually quite interesting . I@@ f you do the right studies , you can look at how much you as an in@@ divi@@ du@@ al sp@@ end on your own health care , pl@@ ot@@ ted over your li@@ fe@@ time ."
"And about se@@ ven years before you &apos;re about to di@@ e , there &apos;s a sp@@ i@@ ke ."
And you can actually — ( Laughter ) — we won &apos;t get into that . ( Laughter )
"There are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of dise@@ as@@ es and experience what I would call heal@@ thy ag@@ ing ."
"I &apos;d sug@@ gest there are four things , and n@@ one of these things in@@ clu@@ de an in@@ sur@@ ance system or a le@@ g@@ al system ."
A@@ ll those things do is change who pa@@ ys .
They don &apos;t actually change what the ac@@ tu@@ al cost of the tre@@ at@@ ment is .
One thing you can do is not treat . You can ra@@ tion health care .
We won &apos;t talk about that any@@ more . It &apos;s too de@@ press@@ ing .
You can pre@@ v@@ ent .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously a lot of mon@@ ies should be put into pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
"But perhaps most interesting , to me any@@ way , and most important , is the idea of di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing a disease much ear@@ li@@ er on in the progre@@ s@@ sion , and then tre@@ ating the disease to c@@ ure the disease instead of tre@@ ating a sy@@ mp@@ tom ."
"Th@@ ink of it in terms of di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , for inst@@ ance ."
"T@@ o@@ day , with di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , what do we do ?"
"We di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the disease even@@ tually , once it be@@ comes sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ ati@@ c , and then we treat the sy@@ mp@@ tom for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years ."
And we do O@@ K . In@@ sul@@ in &apos;s a pretty good ther@@ ap@@ y .
"But even@@ tually it st@@ op@@ s wor@@ king , and di@@ a@@ bet@@ es lea@@ ds to a pre@@ dic@@ table on@@ set of de@@ bi@@ lit@@ ating disease ."
"Wh@@ y cou@@ ldn &apos;t we just in@@ ject the p@@ an@@ cre@@ as with something to re@@ gener@@ ate the p@@ an@@ cre@@ as early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ ati@@ c ?"
"And it might be a little bit exp@@ en@@ sive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would tru@@ ly be able to do something different ."
"This vi@@ de@@ o , I think , gets across the con@@ cept that I &apos;m talking about quite d@@ ra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally ."
This is a ne@@ w@@ t re@@ -@@ gro@@ wing its lim@@ b .
"If a ne@@ w@@ t can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?"
I &apos;ll actually show you some more important fe@@ atures about lim@@ b re@@ gener@@ ation in a moment .
"But what we &apos;re talking about in re@@ gener@@ ative medicine is doing this in every org@@ an system of the body , for tis@@ su@@ es and for org@@ ans the@@ m@@ selves ."
"So today &apos;s reality is that if we get sic@@ k , the mes@@ sage is we will treat your sy@@ mp@@ t@@ oms , and you need to ad@@ just to a new way of life ."
"I would p@@ ose to you that tom@@ or@@ row — and when tom@@ or@@ row is we could de@@ b@@ ate , but it &apos;s within the fore@@ see@@ able future — we will talk about re@@ gener@@ ative re@@ ha@@ bi@@ li@@ ta@@ tion ."
"There &apos;s a lim@@ b pr@@ os@@ the@@ tic up here , si@@ mil@@ ar actually one on the sol@@ di@@ er that &apos;s come back from I@@ ra@@ q ."
There are 3@@ 70 sol@@ di@@ ers that have come back from I@@ ra@@ q that have l@@ ost lim@@ b@@ s .
"I@@ mag@@ ine if instead of fac@@ ing that , they could actually face the re@@ gener@@ ation of that lim@@ b ."
It &apos;s a wi@@ ld con@@ cept .
I &apos;ll show you where we are at the moment in wor@@ king to@@ wards that con@@ cept .
"But it &apos;s app@@ lica@@ ble , again , to every org@@ an system ."
How can we do that ?
The way to do that is to devel@@ o@@ p a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the body .
We need to learn to spea@@ k the body &apos;s language .
And to s@@ wit@@ ch on proc@@ ess@@ es that we knew how to do when we were a fe@@ tu@@ s .
"A ma@@ mm@@ ali@@ an fe@@ tu@@ s , if it l@@ os@@ es a lim@@ b d@@ uring the first tri@@ me@@ ster of pre@@ gn@@ anc@@ y , will re@@ -@@ grow that lim@@ b ."
So our D@@ N@@ A has the cap@@ ac@@ ity to do these kinds of w@@ oun@@ d@@ -@@ heal@@ ing me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms .
"It &apos;s a natural process , but it is l@@ ost as we age ."
"In a child , before the age of about six months , if they l@@ ose their fin@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ p in an ac@@ ci@@ dent , they &apos;ll re@@ -@@ grow their fin@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ p ."
"B@@ y the time they &apos;re five , they won &apos;t be able to do that any@@ more ."
"So to eng@@ age in that con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the body , we need to spea@@ k the body &apos;s language ."
And there are certain to@@ ols in our to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x that all@@ ow us to do this today .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of three of these to@@ ols through which to con@@ verse with the body .
The first is c@@ ell@@ ular ther@@ ap@@ ies .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , we he@@ al our@@ selves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work ."
"Th@@ er@@ e@@ fore , if we can find the right cells and imp@@ l@@ ant them in the body , they may do the heal@@ ing ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , we can use materi@@ als ."
We heard ye@@ ster@@ day about the import@@ ance of new materi@@ als .
"If we can inv@@ ent materi@@ als , desi@@ gn materi@@ als , or ex@@ tr@@ act materi@@ als from a natural environ@@ ment , then we might be able to have those materi@@ als in@@ duce the body to he@@ al itself ."
"And fin@@ ally , we may be able to use s@@ mar@@ t de@@ vic@@ es that will off@@ lo@@ ad the work of the body and all@@ ow it to he@@ al ."
"I &apos;m going to show you an example of each of these , and I &apos;m going to start with materi@@ als ."
S@@ te@@ ve B@@ ad@@ y@@ la@@ k — who &apos;s at the Uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh — about a de@@ ca@@ de ago had a re@@ mark@@ able idea .
"And that idea was that the small in@@ test@@ ine of a pi@@ g , if you thre@@ w away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to re@@ ma@@ in bio@@ lo@@ g@@ ically ac@@ tive , may con@@ tain all of the nec@@ ess@@ ary fac@@ tors and sign@@ als that would sign@@ al the body to he@@ al itself ."
And he asked a very important question .
"He asked the question , if I take that material , which is a natural material that u@@ su@@ ally in@@ duc@@ es heal@@ ing in the small in@@ test@@ ine , and I place it some@@ where else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a tis@@ su@@ e-@@ speci@@ fi@@ c respon@@ se , or would it make small in@@ test@@ ine if I tried to make a new e@@ ar ?"
I wouldn &apos;t be t@@ elling you this story if it wer@@ en &apos;t comp@@ elling .
The picture I &apos;m about to show you is a comp@@ elling picture .
"( Laughter ) H@@ ow@@ ever , for those of you that are even the sli@@ gh@@ test bit s@@ qu@@ ea@@ mi@@ sh — even though you may not like to ad@@ m@@ it it in fron@@ t of your fri@@ ends — the li@@ ghts are down . This is a good time to look at your fe@@ et , ch@@ ec@@ k your B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ ry , do anything other than look at the s@@ cre@@ en . ( Laughter )"
What I &apos;m about to show you is a di@@ a@@ be@@ tic ul@@ c@@ er .
And al@@ though — it &apos;s good to la@@ u@@ gh before we look at this .
This is the reality of di@@ a@@ bet@@ es .
"I think a lot of times we hear about di@@ a@@ be@@ tics , di@@ a@@ be@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , we just don &apos;t con@@ ne@@ ct the ul@@ c@@ er with the even@@ tu@@ al tre@@ at@@ ment , which is a@@ mp@@ u@@ ta@@ tion , if you can &apos;t he@@ al it ."
So I &apos;m going to put the sli@@ de up now . It won &apos;t be up for long .
This is a di@@ a@@ be@@ tic ul@@ c@@ er . It &apos;s tra@@ gi@@ c .
The tre@@ at@@ ment for this is a@@ mp@@ u@@ ta@@ tion .
"This is an ol@@ der la@@ dy . She has c@@ anc@@ er of the li@@ ver as well as di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , and has decided to di@@ e with what &apos; s left of her body int@@ act ."
"And this la@@ dy decided , after a year of at@@ te@@ mp@@ ted tre@@ at@@ ment of that ul@@ c@@ er , that she would try this new ther@@ ap@@ y that S@@ te@@ ve inv@@ en@@ ted ."
That &apos;s what the w@@ ound looked like 1@@ 1 wee@@ ks later .
That material con@@ ta@@ ined only natural sign@@ als .
And that material in@@ duc@@ ed the body to s@@ wit@@ ch back on a heal@@ ing respon@@ se that it didn &apos;t have before .
There &apos;s going to be a couple more dist@@ re@@ ss@@ ing sli@@ des for those of you — I &apos;ll let you know when you can look again .
This is a h@@ or@@ se . The h@@ or@@ se is not in pa@@ in .
"If the h@@ or@@ se was in pa@@ in , I wouldn &apos;t show you this sli@@ de ."
The h@@ or@@ se just has another n@@ os@@ tri@@ l that &apos;s developed because of a ri@@ ding ac@@ ci@@ dent .
"@@ J@@ ust a few wee@@ ks after tre@@ at@@ ment — in this case , ta@@ king that material , tur@@ ning it into a ge@@ l , and p@@ ac@@ king that are@@ a , and then re@@ pe@@ ating the tre@@ at@@ ment a few times — and the h@@ or@@ se he@@ als up ."
"And if you took an ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound of that are@@ a , it would look great ."
Here &apos;s a dol@@ ph@@ in where the f@@ in &apos;s been re@@ -@@ att@@ ach@@ ed .
"There are now 4@@ 00@@ ,000 patients around the world who have used that material to he@@ al their w@@ oun@@ ds ."
C@@ ould you re@@ gener@@ ate a lim@@ b ?
D@@ A@@ R@@ P@@ A just gave S@@ te@@ ve 15 million dollars to le@@ ad an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ in@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion pro@@ ject to beg@@ in the process of asking that question .
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dol@@ lar picture .
This is a 7@@ 8 year@@ -@@ old man who &apos;s l@@ ost the end of his fin@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ p .
Re@@ mem@@ ber that I m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed before the children who l@@ ose their fin@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ ps .
A@@ f@@ ter tre@@ at@@ ment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is cl@@ in@@ ically rele@@ v@@ ant today .
There are materi@@ als that do this . Here are the heart pat@@ ch@@ es .
But could you go a little f@@ ur@@ ther ?
"C@@ ould you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and re@@ move a da@@ mag@@ ed piece of tis@@ sue , put a bio@@ -@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able material on there ?"
You can see here a little bit of heart m@@ us@@ c@@ le be@@ ating in a dis@@ h .
This was done by T@@ er@@ u@@ o O@@ k@@ an@@ o at T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o W@@ om@@ en &apos;s H@@ os@@ p@@ ital .
He can actually grow be@@ ating tis@@ sue in a dis@@ h .
"He ch@@ il@@ ls the dis@@ h , it changes its pro@@ per@@ ties and he pe@@ el@@ s it right out of the dis@@ h ."
It &apos;s the c@@ oo@@ le@@ st stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you c@@ ell-@@ based re@@ gener@@ ation .
And what I &apos;m going to show you here is ste@@ m cells being re@@ mo@@ ved from the hi@@ p of a pati@@ ent .
"A@@ ga@@ in , if you &apos;re s@@ qu@@ ea@@ mi@@ sh , you don &apos;t want to wat@@ ch ."
But this one &apos;s kind of c@@ ool .
"So this is a b@@ y@@ pas@@ s op@@ er@@ ation , just like what A@@ l G@@ ore had , with a difference ."
"In this case , at the end of the b@@ y@@ pas@@ s op@@ er@@ ation , you &apos;re going to see the ste@@ m cells from the pati@@ ent that were re@@ mo@@ ved at the beginning of the proc@@ ed@@ ure being in@@ jec@@ ted direc@@ tly into the heart of the pati@@ ent ."
And I &apos;m st@@ anding up here because at one point I &apos;m going to show you just how early this technology is .
"@@ Here go the ste@@ m cells , right into the be@@ ating heart of the pati@@ ent ."
"And if you look really car@@ e@@ fully , it &apos;s going to be right around this point you &apos;ll actually see a bac@@ k@@ -@@ fl@@ us@@ h ."
You see the cells coming back out .
"We need all s@@ orts of new technology , new de@@ vic@@ es , to get the cells to the right place at the right time ."
"@@ J@@ ust a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data ."
This was a r@@ and@@ om@@ iz@@ ed tri@@ al .
A@@ t this time this was an N of 20 . Now there &apos;s an N of about 100 .
"B@@ a@@ sically , if you take an extre@@ me@@ ly sic@@ k pati@@ ent and you give them a b@@ y@@ pas@@ s , they get a little bit better ."
"If you give them ste@@ m cells as well as their b@@ y@@ pas@@ s , for these particular patients , they be@@ came as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ ati@@ c ."
These are now two years out .
"The c@@ oo@@ le@@ st thing would be is if you could di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the disease early , and pre@@ v@@ ent the on@@ set of the disease to a bad state ."
"This is the same proc@@ ed@@ ure , but now done min@@ im@@ ally inv@@ a@@ si@@ vely , with only three h@@ ol@@ es in the body where they &apos;re ta@@ king the heart and simply in@@ jec@@ ting ste@@ m cells through a l@@ ap@@ ar@@ os@@ cop@@ ic proc@@ ed@@ ure ."
There go the cells .
"We don &apos;t have time to go into all of those deta@@ il@@ s , but ba@@ sically , that works too ."
"You can take patients who are less sic@@ k , and bring them back to an almost as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ ati@@ c state through that kind of ther@@ ap@@ y ."
"@@ Here &apos;s another example of ste@@ m@@ -@@ cell ther@@ ap@@ y that isn &apos;t quite cl@@ ini@@ cal yet , but I think very so@@ on will be ."
"This is the work of K@@ ac@@ ey M@@ ar@@ r@@ a from P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh , along with a number of colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es around the world ."
"They &apos;ve decided that li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id , which — in the United States , we have a lot of li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a great sour@@ ce of ste@@ m cells .
S@@ te@@ m cells are p@@ ac@@ ked in that li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id .
"So you could go in , you could get your tu@@ m@@ my@@ -@@ t@@ uc@@ k ."
"O@@ ut comes the li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id , and in this case , the ste@@ m cells are is@@ ol@@ ated and turned into neurons ."
A@@ ll done in the la@@ b .
"And I think fa@@ ir@@ ly so@@ on , you will see patients being tre@@ ated with their own f@@ at@@ -@@ der@@ i@@ ved , or a@@ di@@ pos@@ e-@@ der@@ i@@ ved , ste@@ m cells ."
I tal@@ ked before about the use of de@@ vic@@ es to d@@ ra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally change the way we treat disease .
Here &apos;s just one example before I cl@@ ose up .
This is equ@@ ally tra@@ gi@@ c .
"We have a very ab@@ i@@ ding and hear@@ t@@ brea@@ king par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship with our colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es at the In@@ sti@@ tu@@ te for S@@ ur@@ gi@@ cal Re@@ sear@@ ch in the U@@ S Ar@@ my , who have to treat the now 1@@ 1@@ ,000 kids that have come back from I@@ ra@@ q ."
M@@ any of those patients are very se@@ ver@@ ely bur@@ ned .
"And if there &apos;s anything that &apos;s been learned about bur@@ n , it &apos;s that we don &apos;t know how to treat it ."
E@@ very@@ thing that is done to treat bur@@ n — ba@@ sically we do a so@@ d@@ ding appro@@ ach .
"We make something over here , and then we trans@@ pl@@ ant it on@@ to the s@@ ite of the w@@ ound , and we try and get the two to take ."
"In this case here , a new , w@@ ear@@ able bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tor has been de@@ sign@@ ed — it should be test@@ ed cl@@ in@@ ically later this year at I@@ S@@ R — by Jo@@ er@@ g G@@ er@@ l@@ ach in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh ."
And that bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tor will l@@ ay down in the w@@ ound b@@ ed .
The gu@@ n that you see there sp@@ ra@@ ys cells .
That &apos;s going to sp@@ r@@ ay cells over that are@@ a .
"The re@@ ac@@ tor will ser@@ ve to fer@@ ti@@ li@@ ze the environ@@ ment , de@@ li@@ ver other things as well at the same time , and ther@@ e@@ fore we will se@@ ed that la@@ wn , as op@@ pos@@ ed to try the so@@ d@@ ding appro@@ ach ."
It &apos;s a comple@@ tely different way of doing it .
So my 1@@ 8 minutes is up .
"So let me fin@@ ish up with some good news , and maybe a little bit of bad news ."
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very po@@ wer@@ ful work .
C@@ lear@@ ly the imag@@ es kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredi@@ b@@ ly difficult because it &apos;s high@@ ly inter@@ -@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ ary .
A@@ l@@ most every field of science engine@@ ering and cl@@ ini@@ cal pr@@ ac@@ tice is inv@@ olved in trying to get this to happen .
"A number of govern@@ ments , and a number of re@@ gi@@ ons , have recogn@@ iz@@ ed that this is a new way to treat disease ."
"The Jap@@ an@@ ese govern@@ ment were perhaps the first , when they decided to in@@ ve@@ st first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field ."
It &apos;s no co@@ inci@@ dence .
Japan is the ol@@ de@@ st country on ear@@ th in terms of its average age .
They need this to work or their health system di@@ es .
So they &apos;re pu@@ tting a lot of str@@ at@@ e@@ gi@@ c in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment fo@@ c@@ used in this are@@ a .
"The Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on , same thing ."
"@@ China , the same thing ."
China just la@@ un@@ ched a national tis@@ su@@ e-@@ engine@@ ering cen@@ ter .
The first year bu@@ d@@ get was 2@@ 50 million U@@ S dollars .
In the United States we &apos;ve had a some@@ what different appro@@ ach .
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , for A@@ l G@@ ore to come and be in the real world as pre@@ si@@ dent ."
We &apos;ve had a different appro@@ ach .
And the appro@@ ach has ba@@ sically been to just sort of fu@@ nd things as they come along .
But there &apos;s been no str@@ at@@ e@@ gi@@ c in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment to bring all of the nec@@ ess@@ ary things to be@@ ar and fo@@ c@@ us them in a car@@ e@@ ful way .
"And I &apos;m going to fin@@ ish up with a quot@@ e , maybe a little ch@@ ea@@ p sho@@ t , at the direc@@ tor of the N@@ I@@ H , who &apos;s a very char@@ m@@ ing man ."
"M@@ y@@ self and J@@ ay V@@ ac@@ an@@ t@@ i from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard went to vi@@ s@@ it with him and a number of his direc@@ tors of his in@@ sti@@ tu@@ te just a few months ago , to try and con@@ v@@ in@@ ce him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 2@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars that he &apos;s going to get next year and fo@@ c@@ us it , in a str@@ at@@ e@@ gi@@ c way , to make s@@ ure we can acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate the p@@ ace at which these things get to patients ."
"And at the end of a very test@@ y me@@ e@@ ting , what the N@@ I@@ H direc@@ tor said was , &quot; Y@@ our vi@@ sion is lar@@ ger than our appe@@ ti@@ te . &quot;"
"I &apos;d like to cl@@ ose by saying that no one &apos;s going to change our vi@@ sion , but together we can change his appe@@ ti@@ te ."
Thank you .
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple re@@ qu@@ est .
"I &apos;d like all of you to pa@@ use for a moment , you w@@ re@@ t@@ ched we@@ a@@ k@@ l@@ ings , and take sto@@ ck of your mi@@ ser@@ able exist@@ ence ."
( Laughter ) Now that was the adv@@ ice that St@@ . B@@ ene@@ di@@ ct gave his rather star@@ t@@ led fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ers in the fi@@ f@@ th century .
It was the adv@@ ice that I decided to fol@@ low my@@ self when I turned 40 .
"@@ U@@ p until that moment , I had been that cla@@ s@@ sic cor@@ p@@ or@@ ate war@@ ri@@ or — I was e@@ ating too much , I was dr@@ in@@ king too much , I was wor@@ king too hard and I was ne@@ g@@ lec@@ ting the family ."
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around .
"In particular , I decided I would try to ad@@ dre@@ ss the th@@ or@@ n@@ y is@@ sue of wor@@ k@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance ."
"So I ste@@ pp@@ ed back from the wor@@ k@@ force , and I sp@@ ent a year at home with my wi@@ fe and four young children ."
But all I learned about wor@@ k@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance from that year was that I found it quite easy to bal@@ ance work and life when I didn &apos;t have any work .
"( Laughter ) No@@ t a very u@@ se@@ ful sk@@ ill , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally when the money run@@ s out ."
"So I went back to work , and I &apos;ve sp@@ ent these se@@ ven years since str@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling with , stud@@ ying and wr@@ iting about wor@@ k@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance ."
And I have four observ@@ ations I &apos;d like to share with you today .
"The first is : if society &apos;s to make any progre@@ ss on this is@@ sue , we need an hon@@ est de@@ b@@ ate ."
But the tr@@ ou@@ ble is so many people talk so much ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh about wor@@ k@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance .
"A@@ ll the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions about f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ -@@ time or dre@@ ss@@ -@@ down F@@ ri@@ da@@ ys or pat@@ er@@ n@@ ity lea@@ ve only ser@@ ve to ma@@ s@@ k the c@@ ore is@@ sue , which is that certain job and car@@ e@@ er cho@@ ic@@ es are f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ ally in@@ comp@@ ati@@ ble with being me@@ an@@ ing@@ fully eng@@ ag@@ ed on a da@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ day bas@@ is with a young family ."
Now the first ste@@ p in sol@@ ving any problem is ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ing the reality of the s@@ it@@ u@@ ation you &apos;re in .
"And the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there lead@@ ing lives of qui@@ et , s@@ cre@@ am@@ ing de@@ s@@ per@@ ation , where they work long , hard h@@ ours at j@@ ob@@ s they h@@ ate to en@@ able them to buy things they don &apos;t need to imp@@ re@@ ss people they don &apos;t like ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s my cont@@ en@@ tion that going to work on F@@ ri@@ day in j@@ e@@ ans and &#91; a &#93; T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t isn &apos;t really getting to the n@@ u@@ b of the is@@ sue . ( Laughter )
The second observ@@ ation I &apos;d like to make is we need to face the tru@@ th that govern@@ ments and cor@@ p@@ or@@ ations ar@@ en &apos;t going to sol@@ ve this is@@ sue for us .
We should stop looking outside .
It &apos;s up to us as in@@ divi@@ du@@ als to take contro@@ l and respon@@ sibi@@ lity for the t@@ yp@@ e of lives that we want to le@@ ad .
"If you don &apos;t desi@@ gn your life , someone else will desi@@ gn it for you , and you may just not like their idea of bal@@ ance ."
"It &apos;s partic@@ ul@@ arly important — this isn &apos;t on the World W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b , is it ? I &apos;m about to get fi@@ red — it &apos;s partic@@ ul@@ arly important that you never put the qu@@ ality of your life in the h@@ ands of a com@@ mer@@ cial cor@@ p@@ or@@ ation ."
"Now I &apos;m not talking here just about the bad comp@@ an@@ ies — the &quot; &quot; ab@@ at@@ to@@ ir@@ s of the human s@@ ou@@ l , &quot; &quot; as I call them ."
( Laughter ) I &apos;m talking about all comp@@ an@@ ies .
Because com@@ mer@@ cial comp@@ an@@ ies are in@@ her@@ ently de@@ sign@@ ed to get as much out of you &#91; as &#93; they can get away with .
"It &apos;s in their nature ; it &apos;s in their D@@ N@@ A ; it &apos;s what they do — even the good , well-@@ int@@ enti@@ on@@ ed comp@@ an@@ ies ."
"O@@ n the one hand , pu@@ tting ch@@ il@@ d@@ care fac@@ i@@ li@@ ties in the wor@@ k@@ place is wonderful and en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed ."
"O@@ n the other hand , it &apos;s a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are — it just means you sp@@ end more time at the b@@ loo@@ dy off@@ ice ."
We have to be respon@@ sible for se@@ tting and en@@ for@@ c@@ ing the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ar@@ ies that we want in our life .
The th@@ ir@@ d observ@@ ation is we have to be car@@ e@@ ful with the time f@@ ra@@ me that we cho@@ ose up@@ on which to j@@ u@@ dge our bal@@ ance .
"@@ Be@@ fore I went back to work after my year at home , I s@@ at down and I wr@@ ote out a deta@@ il@@ ed , ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ ste@@ p descri@@ p@@ tion of the ide@@ al bal@@ anc@@ ed day that I as@@ pi@@ red to ."
And it went like this : wa@@ ke up well re@@ st@@ ed after a good ni@@ ght &apos;s s@@ le@@ ep .
H@@ a@@ ve sex .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g .
H@@ a@@ ve brea@@ k@@ fa@@ st with my wi@@ fe and children .
H@@ a@@ ve sex again .
( Laughter ) D@@ ri@@ ve the kids to school on the way to the off@@ ice .
Do three h@@ ours &apos; work .
P@@ l@@ ay a sp@@ ort with a fri@@ end at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time .
Do another three h@@ ours &apos; work .
M@@ e@@ et some mat@@ es in the pu@@ b for an early even@@ ing dr@@ ink .
D@@ ri@@ ve home for d@@ in@@ ner with my wi@@ fe and kids .
M@@ ed@@ it@@ ate for half an h@@ our .
H@@ a@@ ve sex .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g . H@@ a@@ ve sex again .
G@@ o to b@@ ed .
( Applause ) How o@@ f@@ ten do you think I have that day ?
( Laughter ) We need to be re@@ al@@ is@@ tic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
"We need to el@@ on@@ g@@ ate the time f@@ ra@@ me up@@ on which we j@@ u@@ dge the bal@@ ance in our life , but we need to el@@ on@@ g@@ ate it without f@@ all@@ ing into the tra@@ p of the &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll have a life when I re@@ ti@@ re , when my kids have left home , when my wi@@ fe has di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed me , my health is fa@@ il@@ ing , I &apos;ve got no mat@@ es or interest@@ s left . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A day is too sh@@ ort ; &quot; &quot; after I re@@ ti@@ re &quot; &quot; is too long ."
There &apos;s got to be a mi@@ ddle way .
A f@@ our@@ th observ@@ ation : We need to appro@@ ach bal@@ ance in a bal@@ anc@@ ed way .
"A fri@@ end came to see me last year — and she doesn &apos;t mind me t@@ elling this story — a fri@@ end came to see me last year and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ i@@ ge@@ l , I &apos;ve read your book ."
And I re@@ aliz@@ e that my life is comple@@ tely out of bal@@ ance .
It &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally dom@@ in@@ ated by work .
I work 10 h@@ ours a day ; I comm@@ u@@ te two h@@ ours a day .
A@@ ll of my relation@@ shi@@ ps have fa@@ il@@ ed .
There &apos;s nothing in my life ap@@ ar@@ t from my work .
So I &apos;ve decided to get a g@@ ri@@ p and sort it out .
"So I jo@@ ined a g@@ y@@ m . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now I don &apos;t mean to moc@@ k , but being a f@@ it 1@@ 0@@ -@@ h@@ our@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day off@@ ice r@@ at isn &apos;t more bal@@ anc@@ ed ; it &apos;s more f@@ it . ( Laughter )"
"@@ L@@ o@@ vely though phy@@ sical ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se may be , there are other parts to life — there &apos;s the intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ al side ; there &apos;s the e@@ mo@@ tional side ; there &apos;s the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al side ."
"And to be bal@@ anc@@ ed , I believe we have to att@@ end to all of those are@@ as — not just do 50 st@@ om@@ ach c@@ run@@ ch@@ es ."
Now that can be da@@ un@@ ting .
"Because people say , &quot; &quot; B@@ loo@@ dy h@@ ell m@@ ate , I ha@@ ven &apos;t got time to get f@@ it ."
You want me to go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and call my mother . &quot; &quot; And I understand .
I tru@@ ly understand how that can be da@@ un@@ ting .
But an inci@@ dent that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new per@@ spec@@ tive .
"M@@ y wi@@ fe , who is some@@ where in the au@@ di@@ ence today , called me up at the off@@ ice and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ i@@ ge@@ l , you need to pic@@ k our youn@@ gest son &quot; &quot; — H@@ ar@@ ry — &quot; &quot; up from school . &quot; &quot; Because she had to be some@@ where else with the other three children for that even@@ ing ."
So I left work an h@@ our early that af@@ ter@@ no@@ on and pic@@ ked H@@ ar@@ ry up at the school g@@ ates .
"We wal@@ ked down to the lo@@ cal par@@ k , m@@ ess@@ ed around on the s@@ w@@ ings , play@@ ed some si@@ l@@ ly g@@ am@@ es ."
"I then wal@@ ked him up the h@@ ill to the lo@@ cal ca@@ fe , and we sh@@ ar@@ ed a p@@ iz@@ z@@ a for two , then wal@@ ked down the h@@ ill to our home , and I gave him his b@@ ath and put him in his B@@ at@@ man pa@@ j@@ am@@ as ."
"I then read him a ch@@ ap@@ ter of R@@ o@@ al@@ d D@@ a@@ h@@ l &apos;s &quot; &quot; J@@ am@@ es and the G@@ i@@ ant P@@ each . &quot; &quot; I then put him to b@@ ed , t@@ uc@@ ked him in , gave him a ki@@ ss on his fore@@ head and said , &quot; &quot; Goo@@ d@@ ni@@ ght , m@@ ate , &quot; &quot; and wal@@ ked out of his be@@ dro@@ om ."
"As I was wal@@ king out of his be@@ dro@@ om , he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad ? &quot; &quot; I went , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , m@@ ate ? &quot; &quot; He went , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad , this has been the best day of my life , ever . &quot; &quot; I ha@@ dn &apos;t done anything , ha@@ dn &apos;t taken him to D@@ is@@ ne@@ y World or b@@ ought him a P@@ lay@@ st@@ ation ."
Now my point is the small things matter .
Be@@ ing more bal@@ anc@@ ed doesn &apos;t mean d@@ ra@@ ma@@ tic up@@ he@@ a@@ val in your life .
"@@ W@@ it@@ h the sm@@ al@@ le@@ st in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment in the right pl@@ ac@@ es , you can ra@@ dic@@ ally trans@@ form the qu@@ ality of your relation@@ shi@@ ps and the qu@@ ality of your life ."
"M@@ o@@ re@@ over , I think , it can trans@@ form society ."
"Because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s defin@@ ition of success away from the mor@@ on@@ ically simp@@ li@@ s@@ tic no@@ tion that the person with the most money when he di@@ es w@@ ins , to a more th@@ ou@@ ght@@ ful and bal@@ anc@@ ed defin@@ ition of what a life well li@@ ved looks like ."
"And that , I think , is an idea wor@@ th sp@@ read@@ ing ."
( Applause )
I mo@@ ved to America 12 years ago with my wi@@ fe T@@ er@@ ry and our two kids .
We &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed every country we &apos;ve en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed .
( Applause ) Because it &apos;s lea@@ ving m@@ illions of children be@@ h@@ ind .
It actually cos@@ ts an en@@ orm@@ ous amount to mo@@ p up the da@@ ma@@ ge from the d@@ rop@@ out cri@@ s@@ is .
But the d@@ rop@@ out cri@@ s@@ is is just the ti@@ p of an ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g .
America sp@@ ends more money on education than most other countries .
C@@ la@@ ss si@@ z@@ es are sm@@ all@@ er than in many countries .
"The tr@@ ou@@ ble is , it &apos;s all going in the wrong direc@@ tion ."
"There are three pr@@ inci@@ pl@@ es on which human life fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ es , and they are con@@ tra@@ dic@@ ted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to l@@ ab@@ or and most students have to end@@ ure ."
How about two children or more ? R@@ ight .
And the rest of you have se@@ en such children .
A@@ re@@ n &apos;t they ?
What scho@@ ols are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to do is to find out what kids can do across a very n@@ ar@@ row spec@@ tru@@ m of achi@@ ev@@ ement .
I &apos;m not here to ar@@ gu@@ e against science and mat@@ h .
"A real education has to give equ@@ al we@@ ight to the ar@@ ts , the hum@@ an@@ i@@ ties , to phy@@ sical education ."
A@@ D@@ H@@ D .
"It &apos;s a real achi@@ ev@@ ement to put that particular ab@@ i@@ lity out , or to sti@@ f@@ le it ."
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers are the li@@ fe@@ b@@ loo@@ d of the success of scho@@ ols .
"A@@ n old fri@@ end of m@@ ine — actually very old , he &apos;s de@@ ad ."
There he is . He &apos;s di@@ e@@ ting .
The ro@@ le of a teacher is to fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ate learning .
They should be di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic . They should help .
"So in place of cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , what we have is a culture of comp@@ li@@ ance ."
O@@ ur children and teachers are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to fol@@ low r@@ out@@ ine al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms rather than to exc@@ ite that power of imag@@ in@@ ation and cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
"I mean , you may have a do@@ g ."
"You know , but it doesn &apos;t li@@ st@@ en to R@@ a@@ di@@ o@@ head , does it ?"
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , what we have is a culture of st@@ and@@ ar@@ di@@ z@@ ation ."
That &apos;s one of the problems of the test .
No . I think there &apos;s a population of around five million in F@@ in@@ land .
M@@ any st@@ ates in America have fe@@ wer people in them than that .
It &apos;s like people are sa@@ il@@ ing into a he@@ ad@@ w@@ ind all the time .
It &apos;s a human system .
E@@ very stud@@ ent who d@@ rop@@ s out of school has a reason for it which is ro@@ ot@@ ed in their own bio@@ grap@@ h@@ y .
They may find it bor@@ ing .
They &apos;re very per@@ s@@ on@@ alized .
And they work .
"C@@ ul@@ ture is an organ@@ ic ter@@ m , isn &apos;t it ?"
"In the w@@ in@@ ter of 200@@ 4 , it ra@@ ined in D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ ley ."
S@@ even in@@ ch@@ es of ra@@ in f@@ ell over a very sh@@ ort peri@@ od .
The whole f@@ lo@@ or of D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ ley was car@@ pe@@ ted in f@@ lo@@ w@@ ers for a while .
G@@ re@@ at lead@@ ers know that .
"And if the move@@ ment is strong enough , that &apos;s , in the best sense of the word , a re@@ v@@ olution ."
Thank you very much .
Why do so many people re@@ ach success and then fa@@ il ?
"One of the big reas@@ ons is , we think success is a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et ."
"So we do everything that lea@@ ds up to success , but then we get there . We fig@@ ure we &apos;ve made it , we s@@ it back in our com@@ for@@ t z@@ one , and we actually stop doing everything that made us success@@ ful ."
And it doesn &apos;t take long to go do@@ w@@ n@@ h@@ ill .
"And I can tell you this happens , because it happened to me ."
"@@ Re@@ ach@@ ing success , I worked hard , I pu@@ shed my@@ self ."
"But then I st@@ op@@ p@@ ed , because I fi@@ gu@@ red , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , you know , I made it ."
"I can just s@@ it back and rela@@ x . &quot; &quot; Re@@ ach@@ ing success , I always tried to impro@@ ve and do good work ."
"But then I st@@ op@@ p@@ ed because I fi@@ gu@@ red , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m good enough ."
"I don &apos;t need to impro@@ ve any more . &quot; &quot; Re@@ ach@@ ing success , I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas ."
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas .
"But then I st@@ op@@ p@@ ed , because I fi@@ gu@@ red I was this h@@ ot@@ -@@ sho@@ t guy and I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have to work at ideas , they should just come like ma@@ gi@@ c ."
And the only thing that came was cre@@ ative b@@ loc@@ k .
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t come up with any ideas .
"@@ Re@@ ach@@ ing success , I always fo@@ c@@ used on c@@ li@@ ents and pro@@ jec@@ ts , and i@@ g@@ no@@ red the money . Th@@ en all this money started p@@ our@@ ing in ."
And I got di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted by it .
"And su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I was on the ph@@ one to my sto@@ c@@ k@@ bro@@ ker and my real est@@ ate ag@@ ent , when I should have been talking to my c@@ li@@ ents ."
"And re@@ ach@@ ing success , I always did what I lo@@ ved ."
"But then I got into stuff that I didn &apos;t love , like man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment . I am the world &apos;s wor@@ st man@@ ag@@ er , but I fi@@ gu@@ red I should be doing it , because I was , after all , the pre@@ si@@ dent of the comp@@ any ."
"Well , so@@ on a black cl@@ ou@@ d form@@ ed over my head and here I was , ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ dly very success@@ ful , but in@@ war@@ dly very de@@ press@@ ed ."
But I &apos;m a guy ; I knew how to fi@@ x it .
I b@@ ought a fa@@ st ca@@ r .
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t help .
I was fa@@ ster but just as de@@ press@@ ed .
"So I went to my doc@@ tor . I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ c , I can buy anything I want . But I &apos;m not happy . I &apos;m de@@ press@@ ed ."
"It &apos;s true what they say , and I didn &apos;t believe it until it happened to me ."
"But money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . But it can buy P@@ ro@@ z@@ a@@ c . &quot; &quot; And he put me on an@@ ti@@ -@@ de@@ press@@ an@@ ts ."
"And ye@@ a@@ h , the black cl@@ ou@@ d fa@@ ded a little bit , but so did all the work , because I was just f@@ lo@@ ating along . I cou@@ ldn &apos;t care less if c@@ li@@ ents ever called ."
( Laughter ) And c@@ li@@ ents didn &apos;t call . ( Laughter )
"Because they could see I was no longer ser@@ ving them , I was only ser@@ ving my@@ self ."
So they took their money and their pro@@ jec@@ ts to others who would ser@@ ve them better .
"Well , it didn &apos;t take long for b@@ usiness to dro@@ p like a ro@@ ck ."
"M@@ y par@@ t@@ ner and I , Th@@ om , we had to let all our emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es go ."
"It was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under ."
And that was great .
"Because with no emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , there was no@@ body for me to man@@ age ."
So I went back to doing the pro@@ jec@@ ts I lo@@ ved .
"I had fu@@ n again , I worked har@@ der and , to c@@ ut a long story sh@@ ort , did all the things that took me back up to success ."
But it was@@ n &apos;t a quic@@ k tri@@ p .
It took se@@ ven years .
"But in the end , b@@ usiness gre@@ w big@@ ger than ever ."
"And when I went back to fol@@ lo@@ wing these eight pr@@ inci@@ pl@@ es , the black cl@@ ou@@ d over my head dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed al@@ together ."
"And I w@@ o@@ ke up one day and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t need P@@ ro@@ z@@ a@@ c any@@ more . &quot;"
And I thre@@ w it away and ha@@ ven &apos;t needed it since .
I learned that success isn &apos;t a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t look like this ; it really looks more like this .
It &apos;s a continu@@ ous j@@ our@@ ne@@ y .
"And if we want to a@@ vo@@ id &quot; &quot; success@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ fa@@ il@@ u@@ re@@ -@@ sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , &quot; &quot; we just keep fol@@ lo@@ wing these eight pr@@ inci@@ pl@@ es , because that is not only how we achi@@ e@@ ve success , it &apos;s how we su@@ sta@@ in it ."
So here is to your continu@@ ed success .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"C@@ an we , as ad@@ ul@@ ts , grow new ner@@ ve cells ?"
So this is this gr@@ ay struc@@ ture in the cen@@ ter of the brain .
So why are these new neurons important and what are their fun@@ c@@ tions ?
"F@@ irst , we know that they &apos;re important for learning and mem@@ ory ."
The answer is y@@ es .
And we are now going to do a little qui@@ z .
A@@ re we ready ?
"O@@ K , let &apos;s go ."
So what about learning ?
In@@ cre@@ as@@ ing ?
How about stre@@ ss ?
"@@ Y@@ es , stre@@ ss will de@@ cre@@ ase the produc@@ tion of new neurons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ ca@@ mp@@ us ."
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , it will de@@ cre@@ ase ne@@ u@@ ro@@ gen@@ es@@ is ."
"O@@ h , w@@ ow !@@ "
How about getting ol@@ der ?
"And then fin@@ ally , how about run@@ ning ?"
I will let you j@@ u@@ dge that one by yourself .
"So acti@@ vity imp@@ ac@@ ts ne@@ u@@ ro@@ gen@@ es@@ is , but that &apos;s not all ."
E@@ th@@ an@@ o@@ l — in@@ take of al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l — will de@@ cre@@ ase ne@@ u@@ ro@@ gen@@ es@@ is .
M@@ H : I &apos;m really interest@@ ed in the run@@ ning thing .
Do I have to ru@@ n ?
What is going to be the future of learning ?
"I do have a pl@@ an , but in order for me to tell you what that pl@@ an is , I need to tell you a little story , which kind of se@@ ts the st@@ age ."
"I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in scho@@ ols , where did it come from ?"
"And you can look far back into the past , but if you look at pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing the way it is , it &apos;s quite easy to fig@@ ure out where it came from ."
"It came from about 3@@ 00 years ago , and it came from the last and the big@@ gest of the emp@@ i@@ res on this planet . &#91; &quot; &quot; The B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh E@@ mp@@ ir@@ e &quot; &quot; &#93; I@@ mag@@ ine trying to ru@@ n the show , trying to ru@@ n the enti@@ re planet , without compu@@ ters , without t@@ el@@ e@@ ph@@ ones , with data h@@ and@@ wr@@ it@@ ten on pi@@ ec@@ es of p@@ ap@@ er , and tra@@ vel@@ ing by shi@@ ps ."
But the V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ ans actually did it .
What they did was a@@ ma@@ zing .
They cre@@ ated a global computer made up of people .
It &apos;s still with us today .
It &apos;s called the bu@@ rea@@ uc@@ ra@@ tic ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tive mach@@ ine .
"In order to have that mach@@ ine run@@ ning , you need lots and lots of people ."
They made another mach@@ ine to pro@@ duce those people : the school .
The scho@@ ols would pro@@ duce the people who would then become parts of the bu@@ rea@@ uc@@ ra@@ tic ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tive mach@@ ine .
They must be i@@ d@@ enti@@ cal to each other .
"They must know three things : They must have good h@@ and@@ wr@@ iting , because the data is h@@ and@@ wr@@ it@@ ten ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do multi@@ p@@ li@@ cation , divi@@ sion , ad@@ dition and sub@@ tr@@ action in their head ."
They must be so i@@ d@@ enti@@ cal that you could pic@@ k one up from New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and and ship them to C@@ an@@ ad@@ a and he would be inst@@ an@@ tly fun@@ c@@ tional .
The V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ ans were great engine@@ ers .
"They engine@@ er@@ ed a system that was so ro@@ b@@ ust that it &apos;s still with us today , continu@@ ously produc@@ ing i@@ d@@ enti@@ cal people for a mach@@ ine that no longer exist@@ s ."
"The emp@@ ir@@ e is g@@ one , so what are we doing with that desi@@ gn that produc@@ es these i@@ d@@ enti@@ cal people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?"
&#91; &quot; &quot; S@@ cho@@ ols as we know them are ob@@ so@@ le@@ te &quot; &quot; &#93; So that &apos;s a pretty strong com@@ ment there .
"I said scho@@ ols as we know them now , they &apos;re ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ."
I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re bro@@ ken .
It &apos;s quite fa@@ shi@@ on@@ able to say that the education system &apos;s bro@@ ken .
It &apos;s not bro@@ ken . It &apos;s wonder@@ fully con@@ struc@@ ted .
It &apos;s just that we don &apos;t need it any@@ more . It &apos;s out@@ d@@ ated .
What are the kind of j@@ ob@@ s that we have today ?
"Well , the cl@@ er@@ ks are the compu@@ ters ."
They &apos;re there in thousands in every off@@ ice .
And you have people who gu@@ i@@ de those compu@@ ters to do their cl@@ eri@@ cal j@@ ob@@ s .
Th@@ ose people don &apos;t need to be able to wr@@ ite beau@@ ti@@ fully by hand .
They don &apos;t need to be able to multi@@ p@@ ly numbers in their he@@ a@@ ds .
They do need to be able to read .
"In fact , they need to be able to read di@@ sc@@ er@@ n@@ ing@@ ly ."
"Well , that &apos;s today , but we don &apos;t even know what the j@@ ob@@ s of the future are going to look like ."
"We know that people will work from wh@@ er@@ ever they want , wh@@ en@@ ever they want , in wh@@ at@@ ever way they want ."
How is pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing going to pre@@ p@@ are them for that world ?
"Well , I bu@@ mp@@ ed into this whole thing comple@@ tely by ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I used to te@@ ach people how to wr@@ ite computer progra@@ ms in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i , 14 years ago ."
"And right next to where I used to work , there was a s@@ lu@@ m ."
"And I used to think , how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to wr@@ ite computer progra@@ ms ?"
O@@ r should they not ?
"A@@ t the same time , we also had lots of par@@ ents , rich people , who had compu@@ ters , and who used to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , my son , I think he &apos;s gi@@ f@@ ted , because he does wonderful things with compu@@ ters ."
"And my daughter — o@@ h , su@@ re@@ ly she is ex@@ tra@@ -@@ intellig@@ ent . &quot; &quot; And so on . So I su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly fi@@ gu@@ red that , how come all the rich people are having these ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly gi@@ f@@ ted children ?"
( Laughter ) What did the poor do wrong ?
"I made a h@@ ole in the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary w@@ all of the s@@ lu@@ m next to my off@@ ice , and st@@ uc@@ k a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any Eng@@ lish , didn &apos;t know what the In@@ ter@@ net was ."
The children came run@@ ning in .
"It was three fe@@ et off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h , it &apos;s , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; J@@ ust like that . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an we tou@@ ch it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I@@ f you w@@ ish to . &quot; &quot; And I went away ."
"A@@ b@@ out eight h@@ ours later , we found them bro@@ w@@ sing and teach@@ ing each other how to bro@@ w@@ se ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; Well that &apos;s imp@@ os@@ sible , because — How is it possible ? They don &apos;t know anything . &quot; &quot; M@@ y colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s a simple s@@ olution ."
"One of your students must have been pas@@ sing by , showed them how to use the m@@ ou@@ se . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h , that &apos;s possible . &quot; &quot; So I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment . I went 3@@ 00 mil@@ es out of D@@ el@@ h@@ i into a really re@@ m@@ ote village where the chan@@ ces of a pas@@ sing so@@ f@@ tw@@ are develop@@ ment engine@@ er was very little . ( Laughter ) I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment there ."
"There was no place to st@@ ay , so I st@@ uc@@ k my computer in , I went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids p@@ la@@ ying g@@ am@@ es on it ."
"When they saw me , they said , &quot; We want a fa@@ ster proc@@ ess@@ or and a better m@@ ou@@ se . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; How on Earth do you know all this ? &quot; &quot; And they said something very interesting to me ."
"In an ir@@ r@@ it@@ ated vo@@ ice , they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve gi@@ ven us a mach@@ ine that works only in Eng@@ lish , so we had to te@@ ach our@@ selves Eng@@ lish in order to use it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time , as a teacher , that I had heard the word &quot; &quot; te@@ ach our@@ selves &quot; &quot; said so ca@@ su@@ ally ."
Here &apos;s a sh@@ ort g@@ li@@ mp@@ se from those years .
That &apos;s the first day at the H@@ ole in the W@@ all .
O@@ n your right is an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old .
T@@ o his left is his stud@@ ent . She &apos;s six .
And he &apos;s teach@@ ing her how to bro@@ w@@ se .
"Th@@ en on@@ to other parts of the country , I re@@ pe@@ ated this over and over again , getting ex@@ actly the same results that we were ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; H@@ ole in the w@@ all fil@@ m - 19@@ 9@@ 9 &quot; &quot; &#93; A@@ n ei@@ ght@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old t@@ elling his el@@ der sist@@ er what to do .
"And fin@@ ally a girl expla@@ ining in M@@ ar@@ a@@ th@@ i what it is , and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a proc@@ ess@@ or inside . &quot; &quot; So I started publi@@ shing ."
"I published every@@ where . I wr@@ ote down and meas@@ u@@ red everything , and I said , in n@@ ine months , a group of children left al@@ one with a computer in any language will re@@ ach the same st@@ and@@ ard as an off@@ ice se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary in the W@@ est ."
I &apos;d se@@ en it happen over and over and over again .
"But I was cu@@ ri@@ ous to know , what else would they do if they could do this much ?"
"I started experi@@ m@@ ent@@ ing with other sub@@ jec@@ ts , am@@ ong them , for example , pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s one comm@@ unity of children in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India wh@@ ose Eng@@ lish pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is really bad , and they needed good pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation because that would impro@@ ve their j@@ ob@@ s ."
"I gave them a spe@@ e@@ ch@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ t@@ ex@@ t eng@@ ine in a computer , and I said , &quot; &quot; K@@ e@@ ep talking into it until it t@@ yp@@ es what you say . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They did that , and wat@@ ch a little bit of this ."
C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter : N@@ ice to me@@ et y@@ ou@@ .@@ C@@ hi@@ ld : N@@ ice to me@@ et you .
Su@@ g@@ ata M@@ it@@ r@@ a : The reason I en@@ ded with the face of this young la@@ dy over there is because I su@@ spe@@ ct many of you know her .
She has now jo@@ ined a call cen@@ ter in H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad and may have t@@ or@@ tu@@ red you about your cre@@ d@@ it car@@ d b@@ il@@ ls in a very c@@ lear Eng@@ lish ac@@ cent .
"So then people said , well , how far will it go ?"
Wh@@ ere does it stop ?
I decided I would de@@ stro@@ y my own ar@@ g@@ ument by cre@@ ating an ab@@ sur@@ d pro@@ position .
"I made a hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is , a ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is ."
"T@@ a@@ mi@@ l is a s@@ ou@@ th Indi@@ an language , and I said , can T@@ am@@ il@@ -@@ spea@@ king children in a s@@ ou@@ th Indi@@ an village learn the bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ logy of D@@ N@@ A rep@@ li@@ cation in Eng@@ lish from a stre@@ et@@ side computer ?"
"And I said , I &apos;ll measure them . They &apos;ll get a z@@ er@@ o ."
"I &apos;ll sp@@ end a couple of months , I &apos;ll lea@@ ve it for a couple of months , I &apos;ll go back , they &apos;ll get another z@@ er@@ o ."
"I &apos;ll go back to the la@@ b and say , we need teachers ."
I found a village . It was called K@@ al@@ li@@ k@@ u@@ pp@@ am in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India .
"I put in H@@ ole in the W@@ all compu@@ ters there , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed all kinds of stuff from the In@@ ter@@ net about D@@ N@@ A rep@@ li@@ cation , most of which I didn &apos;t understand ."
"The children came ru@@ shing , said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s all this ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very t@@ op@@ i@@ cal , very important . But it &apos;s all in Eng@@ lish . &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; How can we understand such big Eng@@ lish words and di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms and che@@ mi@@ str@@ y ? &quot; &quot; So by now , I had developed a new pe@@ da@@ go@@ gi@@ cal me@@ th@@ od , so I app@@ li@@ ed that . I said , &quot; &quot; I ha@@ ven &apos;t the fo@@ g@@ gi@@ est idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And any@@ way , I am going away . &quot; ( Laughter )"
So I left them for a couple of months .
They &apos;d got a z@@ er@@ o . I gave them a test .
"I came back after two months and the children t@@ ro@@ op@@ ed in and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve underst@@ ood nothing . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what did I expe@@ ct ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , but how long did it take you before you decided that you can &apos;t understand anything ? &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; We ha@@ ven &apos;t gi@@ ven up ."
"We look at it every single day . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; What ? You don &apos;t understand these s@@ cre@@ ens and you keep star@@ ing at it for two months ? What for ? &quot; &quot; So a little girl who you see just now , she ra@@ ised her hand , and she says to me in bro@@ ken T@@ a@@ mi@@ l and Eng@@ lish , she said , &quot; &quot; Well , ap@@ ar@@ t from the fact that impro@@ per rep@@ li@@ cation of the D@@ N@@ A mo@@ lec@@ u@@ le ca@@ us@@ es disease , we ha@@ ven &apos;t underst@@ ood anything else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So I test@@ ed them ."
"I got an edu@@ ca@@ tional imp@@ os@@ sibi@@ lity , z@@ er@@ o to 30 percent in two months in the t@@ rop@@ i@@ cal he@@ at with a computer under the t@@ ree in a language they didn &apos;t know doing something that &apos;s a de@@ ca@@ de a@@ head of their time ."
A@@ b@@ sur@@ d . But I had to fol@@ low the V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ an n@@ or@@ m .
Th@@ ir@@ ty percent is a fa@@ il .
How do I get them to pas@@ s ? I have to get them 20 more mar@@ ks .
"I cou@@ ldn &apos;t find a teacher . What I did find was a fri@@ end that they had , a 2@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old girl who was an ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ant and she play@@ ed with them all the time ."
"So I asked this girl , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you help them ? &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely not ."
"I didn &apos;t have science in school . I have no idea what they &apos;re doing under that t@@ ree all day long . I can &apos;t help you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what . U@@ se the me@@ th@@ od of the grand@@ mother . &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; St@@ and be@@ h@@ ind them ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever they do anything , you just say , &apos; Well , w@@ ow , I mean , how did you do that ?"
"What &apos;s the next p@@ age ? G@@ os@@ h , when I was your age , I could have never done that . &apos; You know what gr@@ an@@ n@@ ies do . &quot; &quot; So she did that for two more months ."
The s@@ co@@ res j@@ u@@ mp@@ ed to 50 percent .
"@@ K@@ al@@ li@@ k@@ u@@ pp@@ am had ca@@ u@@ ght up with my contro@@ l school in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i , a rich pri@@ v@@ ate school with a tra@@ ined bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ logy teacher ."
Wh@@ en I saw that grap@@ h I knew there is a way to level the p@@ la@@ ying field .
Here &apos;s K@@ al@@ li@@ k@@ u@@ pp@@ am .
( Ch@@ ildren spea@@ king ) Ne@@ ur@@ ons ... comm@@ uni@@ cation .
"I got the ca@@ mer@@ a ang@@ le wrong . That one is just am@@ at@@ e@@ ur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her h@@ ands were like that , and she was saying neurons comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ te ."
A@@ t 12 .
So what are j@@ ob@@ s going to be like ?
"Well , we know what they &apos;re like today ."
"What &apos;s learning going to be like ? We know what it &apos;s like today , children p@@ our@@ ing over with their mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones on the one hand and then re@@ l@@ uc@@ t@@ an@@ tly going to school to pic@@ k up their b@@ oo@@ ks with their other hand ."
What will it be tom@@ or@@ row ?
C@@ ould it be that we don &apos;t need to go to school at all ?
"C@@ ould it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?"
"C@@ ould it be — a de@@ va@@ st@@ ating question , a question that was f@@ ra@@ m@@ ed for me by N@@ i@@ ch@@ ol@@ as Ne@@ g@@ rop@@ on@@ te — could it be that we are he@@ ad@@ ing to@@ wards or maybe in a future where kno@@ wing is ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ?"
But that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ ble . We are h@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens .
"@@ K@@ no@@ wing , that &apos;s what dist@@ in@@ gu@@ i@@ sh@@ es us from the ap@@ es ."
But look at it this way .
It took nature 100 million years to make the ap@@ e st@@ and up and become H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens .
"It took us only 1@@ 0,000 to make kno@@ wing ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ."
What an achi@@ ev@@ ement that is .
But we have to in@@ te@@ gr@@ ate that into our own future .
En@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ment seems to be the k@@ ey .
"If you look at K@@ u@@ pp@@ am , if you look at all of the experi@@ ments that I did , it was simply saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , &quot; &quot; s@@ alu@@ ting learning ."
There is evi@@ dence from neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence .
"The rep@@ ti@@ li@@ an part of our brain , which s@@ its in the cen@@ ter of our brain , when it &apos;s thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , it sh@@ u@@ ts down everything else , it sh@@ u@@ ts down the pre@@ fron@@ t@@ al cor@@ te@@ x , the parts which learn , it sh@@ u@@ ts all of that down ."
P@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment and ex@@ am@@ in@@ ations are se@@ en as thre@@ at@@ s .
"We take our children , we make them sh@@ ut their bra@@ ins down , and then we say , &quot; &quot; P@@ er@@ form . &quot; &quot; Why did they create a system like that ?"
Because it was needed .
There was an age in the A@@ ge of E@@ mp@@ i@@ res when you needed those people who can survi@@ ve under thre@@ at .
"When you &apos;re st@@ anding in a tr@@ en@@ ch all al@@ one , if you could have survi@@ ved , you &apos;re o@@ kay , you &apos;ve pas@@ sed ."
"If you didn &apos;t , you fa@@ il@@ ed ."
But the A@@ ge of E@@ mp@@ i@@ res is g@@ one .
What happens to cre@@ ati@@ vity in our age ?
We need to shi@@ ft that bal@@ ance back from thre@@ at to ple@@ as@@ ure .
I came back to Eng@@ land looking for B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh grand@@ mo@@ thers .
"I put out no@@ tic@@ es in p@@ ap@@ ers saying , if you are a B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh grand@@ mother , if you have bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and and a we@@ b ca@@ mer@@ a , can you give me one h@@ our of your time per wee@@ k for f@@ ree ?"
I got 200 in the first two wee@@ ks .
I know more B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh grand@@ mo@@ thers than any@@ one in the universe . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re called the G@@ ran@@ n@@ y C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
The G@@ ran@@ n@@ y C@@ l@@ ou@@ d s@@ its on the In@@ ter@@ net .
"If there &apos;s a child in tr@@ ou@@ ble , we be@@ am a G@@ r@@ an ."
She goes on over S@@ k@@ yp@@ e and she s@@ orts things out .
"I &apos;ve se@@ en them do it from a village called D@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ les in n@@ or@@ th@@ we@@ ster@@ n Eng@@ land , de@@ ep inside a village in T@@ a@@ mi@@ l N@@ ad@@ u , India , 6@@ ,000 mil@@ es away ."
She does it with only one a@@ ge@@ -@@ old ge@@ st@@ ure .
&quot; S@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot;
O@@ kay ?
W@@ at@@ ch this .
G@@ r@@ and@@ mother : You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me . You say it . You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me .
Ch@@ ildren : You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me . G@@ r@@ and@@ mother : I &apos;m the G@@ ing@@ er@@ b@@ read M@@ an@@ .@@ Ch@@ ildren : I &apos;m the G@@ ing@@ er@@ b@@ read M@@ an . G@@ r@@ and@@ mother : Well done ! V@@ ery good . S@@ M : So what &apos;s happening here ? I think what we need to look at is
we need to look at learning as the produc@@ t of edu@@ ca@@ tional self-@@ organiz@@ ation .
"If you all@@ ow the edu@@ ca@@ tional process to self-@@ organiz@@ e , then learning e@@ mer@@ g@@ es ."
It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
It &apos;s about le@@ tting it happen .
The teacher se@@ ts the process in mo@@ tion and then she st@@ ands back in a@@ we and wat@@ ch@@ es as learning happens .
I think that &apos;s what all this is poin@@ ting at .
But how will we know ? How will we come to know ?
"Well , I int@@ end to build these S@@ el@@ f-@@ O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed L@@ ear@@ ning En@@ viron@@ ments ."
"They are ba@@ sically bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and , col@@ l@@ ab@@ or@@ ation and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ment put together ."
"I &apos;ve tried this in many , many scho@@ ols ."
"It &apos;s been tried all over the world , and teachers sort of st@@ and back and say , &quot; &quot; It just happens by itself ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h , it happens by itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How did you know that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t believe the children who told me and where they &apos;re from . &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a S@@ O@@ L@@ E in action ."
( Ch@@ ildren talking ) This one is in Eng@@ land .
"He ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ins la@@ w and order , because remem@@ ber , there &apos;s no teacher around ."
G@@ ir@@ l : The t@@ ot@@ al number of electr@@ ons is not equ@@ al to the t@@ ot@@ al number of pr@@ ot@@ ons — S@@ M : A@@ u@@ str@@ ali@@ a G@@ ir@@ l : — giving it a net pos@@ itive or ne@@ g@@ ative electri@@ cal char@@ ge .
The net char@@ ge on an i@@ on is equ@@ al to the number of pr@@ ot@@ ons in the i@@ on min@@ us the number of electr@@ ons .
S@@ M : A de@@ ca@@ de a@@ head of her time .
"So S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s , I think we need a cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um of big questions ."
You already heard about that . You know what that means .
"There was a time when St@@ one A@@ ge men and women used to s@@ it and look up at the sk@@ y and say , &quot; What are those tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling li@@ ghts ? &quot;"
"They built the first cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , but we &apos;ve l@@ ost sight of those won@@ dr@@ ous questions ."
We &apos;ve br@@ ought it down to the t@@ ang@@ ent of an ang@@ le .
But that &apos;s not se@@ x@@ y enough .
"The way you would put it to a n@@ in@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ old is to say , &quot; &quot; I@@ f a me@@ te@@ or@@ ite was coming to h@@ it the Earth , how would you fig@@ ure out if it was going to or not ? &quot; &quot; And if he says , &quot; &quot; Well , what ? how ? &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a ma@@ gi@@ c word . It &apos;s called the t@@ ang@@ ent of an ang@@ le , &quot; &quot; and lea@@ ve him al@@ one . He &apos;ll fig@@ ure it out ."
So here are a couple of imag@@ es from S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s .
"I &apos;ve tried incredi@@ ble , incredi@@ ble questions — &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en did the world beg@@ in ? How will it end ? &quot; &quot; — to n@@ in@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds ."
This one is about what happens to the air we brea@@ the .
This is done by children without the help of any teacher .
"The teacher only ra@@ is@@ es the question , and then st@@ ands back and ad@@ mi@@ res the answer ."
So what &apos;s my w@@ ish ?
M@@ y w@@ ish is that we desi@@ gn the future of learning .
"We don &apos;t want to be sp@@ are parts for a great human computer , do we ?"
So we need to desi@@ gn a future for learning .
"And I &apos;ve got to — h@@ ang on , I &apos;ve got to get this wor@@ ding ex@@ actly right , because , you know , it &apos;s very important ."
M@@ y w@@ ish is to help desi@@ gn a future of learning by supp@@ or@@ ting children all over the world to ta@@ p into their won@@ der and their ab@@ i@@ lity to work together .
H@@ el@@ p me build this school .
It will be called the S@@ ch@@ ool in the C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
It will be a school where children go on these intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ al adv@@ en@@ tures dri@@ ven by the big questions which their medi@@ at@@ ors put in .
The way I want to do this is to build a fac@@ i@@ lity where I can study this .
It &apos;s a fac@@ i@@ lity which is pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ally un@@ man@@ ned .
There &apos;s only one gr@@ an@@ n@@ y who man@@ ag@@ es health and sa@@ fe@@ ty .
The rest of it &apos;s from the cl@@ ou@@ d .
"The li@@ ghts are turned on and off by the cl@@ ou@@ d , et@@ c . , et@@ c . , everything &apos;s done from the cl@@ ou@@ d ."
But I want you for another pur@@ p@@ ose .
"You can do S@@ el@@ f-@@ O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed L@@ ear@@ ning En@@ viron@@ ments at home , in the school , outside of school , in clu@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s very easy to do . There &apos;s a great doc@@ ument produc@@ ed by TED which t@@ ells you how to do it .
"If you would ple@@ ase , ple@@ ase do it across all five contin@@ ents and s@@ end me the data , then I &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the S@@ ch@@ ool of C@@ l@@ ou@@ ds , and create the future of learning ."
That &apos;s my w@@ ish .
And just one last thing .
I &apos;ll take you to the top of the H@@ im@@ ala@@ y@@ as .
"A@@ t 1@@ 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et , where the air is th@@ in , I once built two H@@ ole in the W@@ all compu@@ ters , and the children f@@ loc@@ ked there ."
And there was this little girl who was fol@@ lo@@ wing me around .
"And I said to her , &quot; &quot; You know , I want to give a computer to everybody , every child ."
"I don &apos;t know , what should I do ? &quot; &quot; And I was trying to take a picture of her qui@@ e@@ tly ."
"She su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly ra@@ ised her hand like this , and said to me , &quot; G@@ et on with it . &quot;"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I think it was good adv@@ ice .
I &apos;ll fol@@ low her adv@@ ice . I &apos;ll stop talking .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . W@@ ow . ( Applause )
The universe is really big .
"We live in a galax@@ y , the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ alax@@ y ."
There are about a hundred billion stars in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ alax@@ y .
"And if you take a ca@@ mer@@ a and you point it at a ran@@ dom part of the sk@@ y , and you just keep the sh@@ u@@ t@@ ter op@@ en , as long as your ca@@ mer@@ a is att@@ ach@@ ed to the H@@ u@@ b@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e , it will see something like this ."
E@@ very one of these little b@@ lob@@ s is a galax@@ y r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly the si@@ ze of our M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay — a hundred billion stars in each of those b@@ lob@@ s .
There are appro@@ x@@ i@@ mat@@ ely a hundred billion galaxies in the observ@@ able universe .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
"The age of the universe , between now and the Big Bang , is a hundred billion in do@@ g years ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich t@@ ells you something about our place in the universe .
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply ad@@ m@@ ir@@ e it .
It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly beautiful .
"I &apos;ve o@@ f@@ ten wonder@@ ed , what is the ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary press@@ ure that made our an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors in the V@@ el@@ d@@ t ad@@ ap@@ t and ev@@ ol@@ ve to really en@@ jo@@ y pic@@ tures of galaxies when they didn &apos;t have any ."
But we would also like to understand it .
"As a cos@@ mo@@ logi@@ st , I want to ask , why is the universe like this ?"
One big clu@@ e we have is that the universe is chang@@ ing with time .
"If you looked at one of these galaxies and meas@@ u@@ red its vel@@ o@@ c@@ ity , it would be mo@@ ving away from you ."
"And if you look at a galax@@ y even far@@ ther away , it would be mo@@ ving away fa@@ ster ."
So we say the universe is exp@@ anding .
"What that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were cl@@ os@@ er together ."
"In the past , the universe was more d@@ en@@ se , and it was also h@@ ot@@ ter ."
"If you s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze things together , the te@@ m@@ per@@ ature goes up ."
That kind of makes sense to us .
"The thing that doesn &apos;t make sense to us as much is that the universe , at early times , ne@@ ar the Big Bang , was also very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ."
You might think that that &apos;s not a surpri@@ se .
The air in this room is very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h .
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe things just s@@ mo@@ o@@ th@@ ed the@@ m@@ selves out . &quot; &quot; But the con@@ di@@ tions ne@@ ar the Big Bang are very , very different than the con@@ di@@ tions of the air in this room ."
"In particular , things were a lot d@@ en@@ s@@ er ."
The gra@@ vit@@ ati@@ onal pul@@ l of things was a lot stron@@ ger ne@@ ar the Big Bang .
"What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , a hundred billion stars each ."
"A@@ t early times , those hundred billion galaxies were s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ ed into a re@@ gi@@ on about this big — liter@@ ally — at early times ."
"And you have to imagine doing that s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ zing without any im@@ per@@ fe@@ c@@ tions , without any little sp@@ ots where there were a few more at@@ oms than some@@ where else ."
"Because if there had been , they would have col@@ l@@ ap@@ sed under the gra@@ vit@@ ati@@ onal pul@@ l into a hu@@ ge black h@@ ole ."
"@@ K@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing the universe very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h at early times is not easy ; it &apos;s a de@@ lica@@ te ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment ."
It &apos;s a clu@@ e that the early universe is not ch@@ os@@ en r@@ and@@ om@@ ly .
There is something that made it that way .
We would like to know what .
"So part of our underst@@ anding of this was gi@@ ven to us by L@@ u@@ d@@ wi@@ g B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n , an A@@ u@@ stri@@ an phy@@ si@@ ci@@ st in the 19@@ th century ."
And B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n &apos;s con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion was that he hel@@ p@@ ed us understand entropy .
You &apos;ve heard of entropy .
"It &apos;s the r@@ and@@ om@@ ness , the dis@@ order , the c@@ ha@@ o@@ tic@@ ness of some syste@@ ms ."
B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n gave us a for@@ mul@@ a — en@@ gra@@ ved on his tom@@ b@@ st@@ one now — that really quan@@ ti@@ fi@@ es what entropy is .
"And it &apos;s ba@@ sically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the con@@ sti@@ tu@@ ents of a system so that you don &apos;t no@@ tice , so that m@@ ac@@ ros@@ cop@@ ically it looks the same ."
"If you have the air in this room , you don &apos;t no@@ tice each in@@ divi@@ du@@ al at@@ om ."
A low entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation is one in which there &apos;s only a few ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments that look that way .
A high entropy ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment is one that there are many ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments that look that way .
"This is a c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ally important in@@ sight because it hel@@ ps us explain the second la@@ w of ther@@ mo@@ d@@ y@@ n@@ am@@ ic@@ s — the la@@ w that says that entropy increas@@ es in the universe , or in some is@@ ol@@ ated bit of the universe ."
The reason why entropy increas@@ es is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy .
"That &apos;s a wonderful in@@ sight , but it lea@@ ves something out ."
"This in@@ sight that entropy increas@@ es , by the way , is what &apos;s be@@ h@@ ind what we call the ar@@ row of time , the difference between the past and the future ."
"E@@ very difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increas@@ ing — the fact that you can remem@@ ber the past , but not the future ."
"The fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you di@@ e , always in that order , that &apos;s because entropy is increas@@ ing ."
"B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n expla@@ ined that if you start with low entropy , it &apos;s very natural for it to increase because there &apos;s more ways to be high entropy ."
What he didn &apos;t explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
"The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a re@@ f@@ lec@@ tion of the fact that the early universe was very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ."
We &apos;d like to understand that .
That &apos;s our job as cos@@ mo@@ logi@@ sts .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately , it &apos;s actually not a problem that we &apos;ve been giving enough att@@ en@@ tion to ."
"It &apos;s not one of the first things people would say , if you asked a modern cos@@ mo@@ logi@@ st , &quot; What are the problems we &apos;re trying to ad@@ dre@@ ss ? &quot;"
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was R@@ i@@ ch@@ ard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man .
"@@ 50 years ago , he gave a ser@@ ies of a b@@ un@@ ch of different lec@@ tures ."
"He gave the pop@@ ular lec@@ tures that be@@ came &quot; &quot; The Ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter of P@@ hy@@ sical L@@ a@@ w . &quot; &quot; He gave lec@@ tures to C@@ al@@ te@@ ch under@@ gra@@ ds that be@@ came &quot; &quot; The F@@ ey@@ n@@ man L@@ ec@@ tures on P@@ hy@@ sic@@ s . &quot; &quot; He gave lec@@ tures to C@@ al@@ te@@ ch gra@@ du@@ ate students that be@@ came &quot; &quot; The F@@ ey@@ n@@ man L@@ ec@@ tures on G@@ ra@@ vit@@ ation . &quot; &quot; In every one of these b@@ oo@@ ks , every one of these se@@ ts of lec@@ tures , he emp@@ ha@@ si@@ z@@ ed this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le : Why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?"
"So he says — I &apos;m not going to do the ac@@ cent — he says , &quot; &quot; F@@ or some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy cont@@ ent , and since then the entropy has increas@@ ed ."
The ar@@ row of time cannot be comple@@ tely underst@@ ood until the my@@ st@@ ery of the beg@@ in@@ n@@ ings of the history of the universe are re@@ duc@@ ed still f@@ ur@@ ther from spec@@ ulation to underst@@ anding . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s our job .
"We want to know — this is 50 years ago , &quot; &quot; Su@@ re@@ ly , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve fi@@ gu@@ red it out by now . &quot;"
It &apos;s not true that we &apos;ve fi@@ gu@@ red it out by now .
"The reason the problem has g@@ ot@@ ten worse , rather than better , is because in 19@@ 9@@ 8 we learned something c@@ ru@@ cial about the universe that we didn &apos;t know before ."
We learned that it &apos;s acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating .
The universe is not only exp@@ anding .
"If you look at the galax@@ y , it &apos;s mo@@ ving away ."
"If you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be mo@@ ving away fa@@ ster ."
Indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al galaxies are spe@@ ed@@ ing away from us fa@@ ster and fa@@ ster so we say the universe is acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating .
"@@ Un@@ like the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at lea@@ st have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy ."
It &apos;s just the idea that emp@@ ty space itself has energy .
"In every little cu@@ bi@@ c c@@ enti@@ me@@ ter of space , whether or not there &apos;s stuff , whether or not there &apos;s particles , matter , radi@@ ation or wh@@ at@@ ever , there &apos;s still energy , even in the space itself ."
"And this energy , acc@@ ord@@ ing to E@@ instein , ex@@ er@@ ts a p@@ us@@ h on the universe ."
It is a per@@ pe@@ tu@@ al imp@@ ul@@ se that pu@@ sh@@ es galaxies ap@@ ar@@ t from each other .
"Because dark energy , un@@ like matter or radi@@ ation , does not di@@ lu@@ te away as the universe exp@@ ands ."
"The amount of energy in each cu@@ bi@@ c c@@ enti@@ me@@ ter re@@ ma@@ ins the same , even as the universe gets big@@ ger and big@@ ger ."
This has c@@ ru@@ cial imp@@ lica@@ tions for what the universe is going to do in the future .
"For one thing , the universe will exp@@ and fore@@ ver ."
"B@@ ack when I was your age , we didn &apos;t know what the universe was going to do ."
S@@ ome people thought that the universe would re@@ col@@ l@@ ap@@ se in the future .
E@@ instein was f@@ on@@ d of this idea .
"But if there &apos;s dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep exp@@ anding fore@@ ver and ever and ever ."
"@@ 14 billion years in the past , 100 billion do@@ g years , but an in@@ fin@@ ite number of years into the future ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , for all int@@ ents and pur@@ pos@@ es , space looks fin@@ ite to us ."
"S@@ p@@ ace may be fin@@ ite or in@@ fin@@ ite , but because the universe is acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see ."
"There &apos;s a fin@@ ite re@@ gi@@ on of space that we have acc@@ ess to , sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a h@@ or@@ iz@@ on ."
"So even though time goes on fore@@ ver , space is lim@@ ited to us ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , emp@@ ty space has a te@@ m@@ per@@ ature ."
"In the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ a@@ w@@ king told us that a black h@@ ole , even though you think it &apos;s black , it actually em@@ its radi@@ ation when you take into ac@@ coun@@ t quantum me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s ."
"The cur@@ v@@ ature of sp@@ ac@@ e-@@ time around the black h@@ ole br@@ ings to life the quantum me@@ chan@@ i@@ cal fluctu@@ ation , and the black h@@ ole radi@@ ates ."
"A preci@@ se@@ ly si@@ mil@@ ar cal@@ c@@ ulation by H@@ a@@ w@@ king and G@@ ary G@@ i@@ b@@ b@@ ons showed that if you have dark energy in emp@@ ty space , then the whole universe radi@@ ates ."
The energy of emp@@ ty space br@@ ings to life quantum fluctu@@ ations .
"And so even though the universe will last fore@@ ver , and ordin@@ ary matter and radi@@ ation will di@@ lu@@ te away , there will always be some radi@@ ation , some ther@@ m@@ al fluctu@@ ations , even in emp@@ ty space ."
So what this means is that the universe is like a bo@@ x of g@@ as that la@@ sts fore@@ ver .
Well what is the imp@@ li@@ cation of that ?
That imp@@ li@@ cation was studi@@ ed by B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n back in the 19@@ th century .
"He said , well , entropy increas@@ es because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy ."
But that &apos;s a prob@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ s@@ tic st@@ at@@ ement .
"It will probably increase , and the prob@@ ab@@ i@@ lity is en@@ orm@@ ously hu@@ ge ."
It &apos;s not something you have to wor@@ ry about — the air in this room all ga@@ ther@@ ing over one part of the room and suff@@ o@@ ca@@ ting us .
"It &apos;s very , very un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly ."
"E@@ x@@ cept if they loc@@ ked the do@@ ors and ke@@ p@@ t us here liter@@ ally fore@@ ver , that would happen ."
"E@@ very@@ thing that is allowed , every con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation that is allowed to be ob@@ ta@@ ined by the mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es in this room , would even@@ tually be ob@@ ta@@ ined ."
"So B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n says , look , you could start with a universe that was in ther@@ m@@ al equ@@ i@@ li@@ bri@@ um ."
He didn &apos;t know about the Big Bang . He didn &apos;t know about the exp@@ an@@ sion of the universe .
He thought that space and time were expla@@ ined by I@@ sa@@ a@@ c Ne@@ w@@ ton — they were ab@@ solu@@ te ; they just st@@ uc@@ k there fore@@ ver .
So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es were just sp@@ read out even@@ ly every@@ where — the everything mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es .
"But if you &apos;re B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n , you know that if you wa@@ it long enough , the ran@@ dom fluctu@@ ations of those mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es will o@@ c@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally bring them into lo@@ wer entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations ."
"And then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will exp@@ and back ."
"So it &apos;s not that entropy must always increase — you can get fluctu@@ ations into lo@@ wer entropy , more organiz@@ ed s@@ it@@ u@@ ations ."
"Well if that &apos;s true , B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n then goes on@@ to inv@@ ent two very moder@@ n@@ -@@ s@@ oun@@ ding ideas — the multi@@ verse and the an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic pr@@ inci@@ ple ."
"He says , the problem with ther@@ m@@ al equ@@ i@@ li@@ bri@@ um is that we can &apos;t live there ."
"@@ Re@@ mem@@ ber , life itself dep@@ ends on the ar@@ row of time ."
"We would not be able to process information , me@@ t@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ ze , wal@@ k and talk , if we li@@ ved in ther@@ m@@ al equ@@ i@@ li@@ bri@@ um ."
"So if you imagine a very , very big universe , an in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely big universe , with r@@ and@@ om@@ ly bu@@ mp@@ ing into each other particles , there will o@@ c@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally be small fluctu@@ ations in the lo@@ wer entropy st@@ ates , and then they rela@@ x back ."
But there will also be lar@@ ge fluctu@@ ations .
"O@@ c@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally , you will make a planet or a star or a galax@@ y or a hundred billion galaxies ."
"So B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n says , we will only live in the part of the multi@@ verse , in the part of this in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely big set of fluctu@@ ating particles , where life is possible ."
That &apos;s the re@@ gi@@ on where entropy is low .
Ma@@ ybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time .
"Now your h@@ ome@@ work as@@ sign@@ ment is to really think about this , to con@@ te@@ mp@@ l@@ ate what it means ."
"C@@ ar@@ l S@@ ag@@ an once fa@@ m@@ ously said that &quot; &quot; in order to make an app@@ le pi@@ e , you must first inv@@ ent the universe . &quot; &quot; But he was not right ."
"In B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n &apos;s sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o , if you want to make an app@@ le pi@@ e , you just wa@@ it for the ran@@ dom mo@@ tion of at@@ oms to make you an app@@ le pi@@ e ."
"That will happen much more fre@@ qu@@ ently than the ran@@ dom mo@@ tions of at@@ oms making you an app@@ le or@@ ch@@ ard and some sug@@ ar and an o@@ ven , and then making you an app@@ le pi@@ e ."
So this sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o makes pre@@ dic@@ tions .
And the pre@@ dic@@ tions are that the fluctu@@ ations that make us are min@@ im@@ al .
"E@@ ven if you imagine that this room we are in now exist@@ s and is real and here we are , and we have , not only our me@@ mor@@ ies , but our imp@@ re@@ s@@ sion that outside there &apos;s something called C@@ al@@ te@@ ch and the United States and the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ alax@@ y , it &apos;s much ea@@ si@@ er for all those imp@@ re@@ s@@ sions to r@@ and@@ om@@ ly fluctu@@ ate into your brain than for them actually to r@@ and@@ om@@ ly fluctu@@ ate into C@@ al@@ te@@ ch , the United States and the galax@@ y ."
"The good news is that , ther@@ e@@ fore , this sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o does not work ; it is not right ."
This sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o pre@@ dic@@ ts that we should be a min@@ im@@ al fluctu@@ ation .
"E@@ ven if you left our galax@@ y out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies ."
And F@@ ey@@ n@@ man also underst@@ ood this .
"F@@ ey@@ n@@ man says , &quot; &quot; F@@ rom the hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is that the world is a fluctu@@ ation , all the pre@@ dic@@ tions are that if we look at a part of the world we &apos;ve never se@@ en before , we will find it mi@@ x@@ ed up , and not like the piece we &apos;ve just looked at — high entropy ."
"If our order were du@@ e to a fluctu@@ ation , we would not expe@@ ct order any@@ where but where we have just no@@ tic@@ ed it ."
We ther@@ e@@ fore con@@ clu@@ de the universe is not a fluctu@@ ation . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s good . The question is then what is the right answer ?
"If the universe is not a fluctu@@ ation , why did the early universe have a low entropy ?"
"And I would love to tell you the answer , but I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time ."
"( Laughter ) Here is the universe that we tell you about , ver@@ su@@ s the universe that really exist@@ s ."
I just showed you this picture .
The universe is exp@@ anding for the last 10 billion years or so .
It &apos;s co@@ ol@@ ing off .
But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
"If the dark energy re@@ ma@@ ins around , the stars around us will use up their n@@ uc@@ lear fu@@ el , they will stop bur@@ ning ."
They will f@@ all into black h@@ ol@@ es .
We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black h@@ ol@@ es .
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years — a lot longer than our little universe has li@@ ved .
The future is much longer than the past .
But even black h@@ ol@@ es don &apos;t last fore@@ ver .
"They will ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ate , and we will be left with nothing but emp@@ ty space ."
That emp@@ ty space la@@ sts essenti@@ ally fore@@ ver .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , you no@@ tice , since emp@@ ty space gi@@ ves off radi@@ ation , there &apos;s actually ther@@ m@@ al fluctu@@ ations , and it c@@ y@@ c@@ les around all the different possible com@@ b@@ in@@ ations of the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom that ex@@ ist in emp@@ ty space ."
"So even though the universe la@@ sts fore@@ ver , there &apos;s only a fin@@ ite number of things that can pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly happen in the universe ."
They all happen over a peri@@ od of time equ@@ al to 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years .
So here &apos;s two questions for you .
"@@ N@@ um@@ ber one : I@@ f the universe la@@ sts for 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years , why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it , in the war@@ m , com@@ for@@ table af@@ ter@@ g@@ low of the Big Bang ?"
Why ar@@ en &apos;t we in emp@@ ty space ?
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s nothing there to be li@@ ving , &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not right ."
You could be a ran@@ dom fluctu@@ ation out of the no@@ thin@@ g@@ ness .
Why ar@@ en &apos;t you ?
M@@ ore h@@ ome@@ work as@@ sign@@ ment for you .
"So like I said , I don &apos;t actually know the answer ."
I &apos;m going to give you my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
E@@ i@@ ther it &apos;s just like that . There is no ex@@ plan@@ ation .
This is a br@@ u@@ te fact about the universe that you should learn to ac@@ cept and stop asking questions .
O@@ r maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe .
"A@@ n e@@ g@@ g , an un@@ bro@@ ken e@@ g@@ g , is a low entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation , and yet , when we op@@ en our re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ or , we do not go , &quot; &quot; H@@ a@@ h , how surpri@@ sing to find this low entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation in our re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ or . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s because an e@@ g@@ g is not a cl@@ osed system ; it comes out of a ch@@ ic@@ ken ."
Ma@@ ybe the universe comes out of a univers@@ al ch@@ ic@@ ken .
"M@@ a@@ ybe there is something that natur@@ ally , through the growth of the la@@ ws of physics , gi@@ ves ri@@ se to universe like ours in low entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations ."
"If that &apos;s true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much big@@ ger multi@@ verse ."
That &apos;s my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
So the organiz@@ ers asked me to end with a bo@@ ld spec@@ ulation .
M@@ y bo@@ ld spec@@ ulation is that I will be ab@@ solu@@ tely v@@ in@@ di@@ ca@@ ted by history .
"And 50 years from now , all of my cur@@ r@@ ent wi@@ ld ideas will be ac@@ cep@@ ted as tru@@ ths by the scienti@@ fi@@ c and ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al comm@@ uni@@ ties ."
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much lar@@ ger multi@@ verse .
"And even better , we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to comp@@ are to observ@@ ations ."
This is a pre@@ dic@@ tion . I might be wrong .
"But we &apos;ve been thinking as a human r@@ ace about what the universe was like , why it came to be in the way it did for many , many years ."
It &apos;s exc@@ iting to think we may fin@@ ally know the answer some@@ day .
Thank you .
( Applause )
The in@@ du@@ stri@@ al er@@ a started two secon@@ ds ago .
S@@ ome people would say it &apos;s technology .
"Now it &apos;s true , technology has acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ated through human history , and right now , technology adv@@ anc@@ es extre@@ me@@ ly r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly — that is the pro@@ x@@ im@@ ate cause , that &apos;s why we are cur@@ r@@ ently so very produc@@ tive ."
"If we look under the h@@ ood , this is what we find : ba@@ sically the same thing ."
"One is a little lar@@ ger , it maybe also has a few tri@@ c@@ ks in the ex@@ act way it &apos;s wi@@ red ."
"Th@@ ese in@@ vi@@ sible differ@@ ences cannot be too comp@@ lica@@ ted , h@@ ow@@ ever , because there have only been 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations since our last common an@@ ce@@ st@@ or ."
We know that comp@@ lica@@ ted me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms take a long time to ev@@ ol@@ ve .
"So this then seems pretty ob@@ vi@@ ous that everything we &apos;ve achi@@ ev@@ ed , and everything we care about , dep@@ ends c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ally on some rela@@ tively min@@ or changes that made the human mind ."
You would have human progra@@ mm@@ ers that would pain@@ sta@@ k@@ ing@@ ly h@@ and@@ c@@ ra@@ ft kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge it@@ e@@ ms .
"But since then , a par@@ a@@ di@@ g@@ m shi@@ ft has taken place in the field of arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intellig@@ ence ."
"T@@ o@@ day , the action is really around mach@@ ine learning ."
"So rather than h@@ and@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ ting kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ta@@ tions and fe@@ atures , we create al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms that learn , o@@ f@@ ten from ra@@ w per@@ cep@@ tu@@ al data ."
B@@ a@@ sically the same thing that the human in@@ f@@ ant does .
"Now of course , A@@ .@@ I@@ . is still no@@ where ne@@ ar having the same po@@ wer@@ ful , c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ dom@@ a@@ in ab@@ i@@ lity to learn and pl@@ an as a human being has ."
"Now , it could happen much , much later , or so@@ on@@ er , the tru@@ th is no@@ body really kno@@ ws ."
This comes down to physics .
"A bio@@ logical neur@@ on fi@@ res , maybe , at 200 her@@ t@@ z , 200 times a second ."
But even a pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day tr@@ an@@ sist@@ or op@@ er@@ ates at the G@@ i@@ ga@@ her@@ t@@ z .
"@@ Ne@@ ur@@ ons pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ate s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly in a@@ x@@ ons , 100 me@@ ters per second , t@@ op@@ s ."
"But in compu@@ ters , sign@@ als can tra@@ vel at the spe@@ ed of light ."
"So the p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al for super@@ intellig@@ ence lies d@@ orm@@ ant in matter , much like the power of the at@@ om l@@ ay d@@ orm@@ ant thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out human history , pati@@ ently wa@@ iting there until 19@@ 45 ."
And I think we might then see an intellig@@ ence expl@@ os@@ i@@ on .
"And then , after many , many more years of really hard work , lots of in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment , maybe even@@ tually we get to ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e-@@ level arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intellig@@ ence ."
"And then , after even more years of really , really hard work , we get to village i@@ di@@ o@@ t arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intellig@@ ence ."
"And a few mom@@ ents later , we are be@@ y@@ on@@ d E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The tra@@ in doesn &apos;t stop at H@@ um@@ an@@ vil@@ le S@@ ta@@ tion .
"It &apos;s li@@ ke@@ ly , rather , to s@@ w@@ o@@ os@@ h right by ."
"Now this has pro@@ found imp@@ lica@@ tions , partic@@ ul@@ arly when it comes to questions of power ."
"O@@ n@@ ce there is super@@ intellig@@ ence , the f@@ ate of hum@@ an@@ ity may dep@@ end on what the super@@ intellig@@ ence does ."
Th@@ ink about it : M@@ ach@@ ine intellig@@ ence is the last inv@@ en@@ tion that hum@@ an@@ ity will ever need to make .
"M@@ ach@@ ines will then be better at inv@@ ent@@ ing than we are , and they &apos;ll be doing so on di@@ g@@ ital tim@@ es@@ cal@@ es ."
What this means is ba@@ sically a t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ ing of the future .
"A@@ ll of this super@@ intellig@@ ence could devel@@ o@@ p , and pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly quite r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly ."
"Now , a super@@ intellig@@ ence with such techno@@ logical mat@@ ur@@ ity would be extre@@ me@@ ly po@@ wer@@ ful , and at lea@@ st in some sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os , it would be able to get what it wan@@ ts ."
We would then have a future that would be shap@@ ed by the pre@@ fer@@ ences of this A@@ .@@ I@@ .
Here it gets tri@@ c@@ ki@@ er .
"T@@ o make any he@@ ad@@ way with this , we must first of all a@@ vo@@ id an@@ th@@ rop@@ om@@ or@@ p@@ hi@@ zing ."
"And this is ir@@ on@@ ic because every ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ar@@ tic@@ le about the future of A@@ .@@ I@@ . has a picture of this : So I think what we need to do is to con@@ ce@@ i@@ ve of the is@@ sue more ab@@ str@@ actly , not in terms of vi@@ vi@@ d H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ ood sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os ."
"We need to think of intellig@@ ence as an op@@ ti@@ mi@@ z@@ ation process , a process that ste@@ ers the future into a particular set of con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations ."
A super@@ intellig@@ ence is a really strong op@@ ti@@ mi@@ z@@ ation process .
"This means that there is no nec@@ ess@@ ary connec@@ tion between being high@@ ly intellig@@ ent in this sense , and having an ob@@ jec@@ tive that we hum@@ ans would find wor@@ th@@ while or me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful ."
Su@@ pp@@ ose we give an A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to make hum@@ ans s@@ mi@@ le .
"When the A@@ .@@ I@@ . be@@ comes super@@ intellig@@ ent , it re@@ aliz@@ es that there is a more effec@@ tive way to achi@@ e@@ ve this go@@ al : take contro@@ l of the world and s@@ tic@@ k elec@@ t@@ ro@@ des into the fac@@ i@@ al m@@ us@@ c@@ les of hum@@ ans to cause con@@ st@@ ant , be@@ am@@ ing gr@@ ins ."
"A@@ no@@ ther example , supp@@ ose we give A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to sol@@ ve a difficult ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical problem ."
This is a le@@ s@@ son that &apos;s also ta@@ u@@ ght in many a my@@ th .
"He tou@@ ch@@ es his daughter , she turns into go@@ ld ."
"Now you might say , if a computer star@@ ts s@@ tic@@ king elec@@ t@@ ro@@ des into people &apos;s fac@@ es , we &apos;d just sh@@ ut it off ."
"A , this is not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly so easy to do if we &apos;ve gro@@ wn dep@@ end@@ ent on the system — like , where is the off s@@ wit@@ ch to the In@@ ter@@ net ?"
They cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly had reas@@ ons .
"The point is , we should not be con@@ fi@@ dent that we have this under contro@@ l here ."
"So we dis@@ con@@ ne@@ ct the e@@ ther@@ net ca@@ ble to create an air ga@@ p , but again , like mer@@ ely human h@@ ac@@ k@@ ers r@@ out@@ in@@ ely trans@@ gre@@ ss air g@@ aps using social engine@@ ering ."
"M@@ ore cre@@ ative sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os are also possible , like if you &apos;re the A@@ .@@ I@@ . , you can imagine wi@@ g@@ g@@ ling elec@@ t@@ ro@@ des around in your inter@@ n@@ al cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry to create radi@@ o wa@@ ves that you can use to comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ te ."
"S@@ o@@ on@@ er or later , it will out ."
I see no way around this difficult problem .
"Now , I &apos;m actually fa@@ ir@@ ly op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic that this problem can be sol@@ ved ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , we would create an A@@ .@@ I@@ . that us@@ es its intellig@@ ence to learn what we valu@@ e , and its mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation system is con@@ struc@@ ted in such a way that it is mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated to pur@@ sue our valu@@ es or to per@@ form ac@@ tions that it pre@@ dic@@ ts we would appro@@ ve of ."
We would th@@ us le@@ verage its intellig@@ ence as much as possible to sol@@ ve the problem of valu@@ e-@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing .
The ini@@ ti@@ al con@@ di@@ tions for the intellig@@ ence expl@@ os@@ i@@ on might need to be set up in just the right way if we are to have a contro@@ l@@ led de@@ t@@ on@@ ation .
Here is the wor@@ ry : Ma@@ king super@@ intellig@@ ent A@@ .@@ I@@ . is a really hard chall@@ en@@ ge .
"So I think that we should work out a s@@ olution to the contro@@ l problem in adv@@ ance , so that we have it a@@ va@@ il@@ able by the time it is needed ."
"This to me looks like a thing that is well wor@@ th doing and I can imagine that if things turn out o@@ kay , that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mat@@ ter@@ ed was to get this thing right ."
"@@ No@@ t your@@ s , of course — other people &apos;s ."
So I decided to try and wr@@ ite something more fu@@ n .
And I came up with an idea that I would wr@@ ite a c@@ oo@@ k@@ book .
C@@ an any@@ body see anything but the left one being longer ?
"If I co@@ ver the rest of the cu@@ be , you can see that they are i@@ d@@ enti@@ cal ."
V@@ i@@ sion is one of the best things we do .
"So I want to show you some cogn@@ itive il@@ lu@@ sions , or deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making il@@ lu@@ sions , in the same way ."
"@@ G@@ er@@ many is on the left , and A@@ u@@ stri@@ a is on the right ."
"The Ne@@ ther@@ l@@ ands is on the left , and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um is on the right ."
"@@ Pe@@ ople don &apos;t ch@@ ec@@ k , and they don &apos;t jo@@ in ."
"( Laughter ) Now , think about what this means ."
"A@@ ll these medi@@ ca@@ tions , nothing seems to be wor@@ king ."
What do you do ? Do you pul@@ l the pati@@ ent back and try i@@ bu@@ prof@@ en ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple of more exa@@ mp@@ les on ir@@ ra@@ tional deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making .
"Now , wee@@ k@@ end in P@@ ar@@ is , wee@@ k@@ end in R@@ ome — these are different things ."
"If you want co@@ ff@@ e@@ e , you have to p@@ ay for it yourself , it &apos;s two e@@ u@@ ro@@ s 50 ."
This is why we have these f@@ our@@ -@@ minu@@ te d@@ ates .
"I &apos;ll show you imag@@ es here , no real people , but the experiment was with people ."
"I showed some people a picture of T@@ om , and a picture of J@@ er@@ ry ."
"@@ and I said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o do you want to d@@ ate ?"
"And the question was , will u@@ g@@ ly J@@ er@@ ry and u@@ g@@ ly T@@ om help their re@@ spec@@ tive , more at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive bro@@ thers ?"
Now you get it .
&quot; What a piece of work is a man ! How no@@ ble in reason ! &quot;
"A@@ re we Su@@ per@@ man , or are we H@@ om@@ er S@@ imp@@ son ?"
( Applause )
But they didn &apos;t rele@@ ase their energy in light .
"Now , most people thought they were n@@ u@@ ts ."
And they pas@@ sed through you and me .
And they pas@@ sed through the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor .
"You know , it was the pa@@ y@@ off of my car@@ e@@ er , ba@@ sically ."
That &apos;s why everyone thought the L@@ I@@ G@@ O people were n@@ u@@ ts .
A@@ u@@ di@@ ble sound has a wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th that can be up to 50 fe@@ et long .
That &apos;s A@@ li@@ ce talking .
That &apos;s B@@ o@@ b inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ting .
S@@ il@@ ly B@@ o@@ b .
"So , the same is true of gra@@ vit@@ ati@@ onal wa@@ ves ."
We can &apos;t use them to make simple imag@@ es of things out in the Uni@@ verse .
It &apos;s sort of the vo@@ ca@@ b@@ ul@@ ary of sp@@ in imp@@ r@@ in@@ ted on this wa@@ ve@@ form .
It &apos;s f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic .
And we know it because we heard it .
That &apos;s the la@@ st@@ ing import@@ ance of L@@ I@@ G@@ O .
"@@ W@@ it@@ h gra@@ vit@@ ati@@ onal wa@@ ves , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning ."
"@@ P@@ lan@@ et@@ ary syste@@ ms outside our own are like dist@@ ant ci@@ ties wh@@ ose li@@ ghts we can see tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling , but wh@@ ose stre@@ ets we can &apos;t wal@@ k ."
"B@@ y stud@@ ying those tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling li@@ ghts though , we can learn about how stars and planets inter@@ act to form their own ec@@ os@@ y@@ ste@@ m and make ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s that are am@@ en@@ able to life ."
"In this i@@ ma@@ ge of the T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o sk@@ y@@ l@@ ine , I &apos;ve hi@@ dd@@ en data from the ne@@ we@@ st plan@@ et@@ -@@ h@@ un@@ ting space t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e on the b@@ loc@@ k , the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er M@@ is@@ sion ."
C@@ an you see it ?
There we go .
"This is just a tiny part of the sk@@ y the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er star@@ es at , where it sear@@ ch@@ es for planets by meas@@ uring the light from over 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 stars , all at once , every half h@@ our , and very preci@@ se@@ ly ."
And what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny di@@ mm@@ ing of light that is ca@@ used by a planet pas@@ sing in fron@@ t of one of these stars and b@@ loc@@ king some of that star@@ light from getting to us .
"In just over two years of op@@ er@@ ations , we &apos;ve found over 1@@ ,@@ 200 p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al new plan@@ et@@ ary syste@@ ms around other stars ."
"T@@ o give you some per@@ spec@@ tive , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous two de@@ ca@@ des of sear@@ ching , we had only known about 4@@ 00 pri@@ or to K@@ e@@ pl@@ er ."
"When we see these little di@@ ps in the light , we can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine a number of things ."
"For one thing , we can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine that there &apos;s a planet there , but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its par@@ ent star ."
That dist@@ ance is really important because it t@@ ells us how much light the planet re@@ ce@@ i@@ ves o@@ ver@@ all .
"And that dist@@ ance and kno@@ wing that amount of light is important because it &apos;s a little like you or I s@@ it@@ ting around a ca@@ mp@@ fire : You want to be cl@@ ose enough to the ca@@ mp@@ fire so that you &apos;re war@@ m , but not so cl@@ ose that you &apos;re too to@@ a@@ st@@ y and you get bur@@ ned ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , there &apos;s more to know about your par@@ ent star than just how much light you re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve o@@ ver@@ all ."
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Sun .
It &apos;s sho@@ wn here in vi@@ sible light .
That &apos;s the light that you can see with your own human ey@@ es .
You &apos;ll no@@ tice that it looks pretty much like the ic@@ on@@ ic y@@ ell@@ ow b@@ all — that Sun that we all d@@ ra@@ w when we &apos;re children .
"But you &apos;ll no@@ tice something else , and that &apos;s that the face of the Sun has f@@ rec@@ k@@ les ."
"Th@@ ese f@@ rec@@ k@@ les are called s@@ un@@ sp@@ ots , and they are just one of the man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ations of the Sun &apos;s magnetic field ."
They also cause the light from the star to v@@ ary .
"And we can measure this very , very preci@@ se@@ ly with K@@ e@@ pl@@ er and tr@@ ace their effec@@ ts ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , these are just the ti@@ p of the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g ."
"If we had U@@ V ey@@ es or X@@ -@@ r@@ ay ey@@ es , we would really see the d@@ y@@ na@@ mic and d@@ ra@@ ma@@ tic effec@@ ts of our Sun &apos;s magnetic acti@@ vity — the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well ."
"@@ J@@ ust think , even when it &apos;s cl@@ ou@@ dy outside , these kind of ev@@ ents are happening in the sk@@ y ab@@ ove you all the time ."
"So when we want to learn whether a planet is ha@@ b@@ it@@ able , whether it might be am@@ en@@ able to life , we want to know not only how much t@@ ot@@ al light it re@@ ce@@ i@@ ves and how war@@ m it is , but we want to know about its space we@@ a@@ ther — this high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation , the U@@ V and the X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys that are cre@@ ated by its star and that ba@@ the it in this b@@ ath of high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation ."
"And so , we can &apos;t really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of deta@@ il that we can look at planets in our own solar system ."
"I &apos;m sho@@ wing here V@@ en@@ us , Earth and M@@ ar@@ s — three planets in our own solar system that are r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly the same si@@ ze , but only one of which is really a good place to live ."
But what we can do in the me@@ an@@ time is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relation@@ ship between the planets and their par@@ ent stars to su@@ ss out clu@@ es about which planets might be good pl@@ ac@@ es to look for life in the universe .
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er won &apos;t find a planet around every single star it looks at .
"But really , every meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment it makes is preci@@ ous , because it &apos;s teach@@ ing us about the relation@@ ship between stars and planets , and how it &apos;s really the star@@ light that se@@ ts the st@@ age for the formation of life in the universe ."
"Wh@@ ile it &apos;s K@@ e@@ pl@@ er the t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e , the in@@ str@@ ument that star@@ es , it &apos;s we , life , who are sear@@ ching ."
Thank you .

"A human child is born , and for quite a long time is a con@@ su@@ m@@ er ."
It cannot be con@@ sci@@ ously a con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tor .
It is hel@@ p@@ less .
"It doesn &apos;t know how to survi@@ ve , even though it is en@@ do@@ wed with an inst@@ in@@ ct to survi@@ ve ."

That imp@@ lies the tru@@ st@@ ed person won &apos;t viol@@ ate the trust .

"One cannot con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te un@@ less one feel@@ s se@@ c@@ ure , one feel@@ s big , one feel@@ s : I have enough ."
T@@ o be compas@@ sion@@ ate is not a jo@@ ke .
It &apos;s not that simple .
One has to disco@@ ver a certain big@@ ness in on@@ es@@ el@@ f .
"That big@@ ness should be cen@@ ter@@ ed on on@@ es@@ el@@ f , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wi@@ el@@ d , not in terms of any st@@ at@@ us that you can comm@@ and in the society , but it should be cen@@ ter@@ ed on on@@ es@@ el@@ f ."
The self : you are self-@@ a@@ w@@ are .
"O@@ n that self , it should be cen@@ ter@@ ed — a big@@ ness , a wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess ."
"O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , compassion is just a word and a dre@@ am ."
"You can be compas@@ sion@@ ate o@@ c@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally , more mo@@ ved by emp@@ a@@ thy than by compassion ."
Thank G@@ od we are emp@@ a@@ the@@ tic .
"When somebody &apos;s in pa@@ in , we pic@@ k up the pa@@ in ."
"In a W@@ im@@ b@@ le@@ don fin@@ al mat@@ ch , these two gu@@ ys fi@@ ght it out ."
E@@ ach one has got two g@@ am@@ es .

One person w@@ ins .

"The w@@ in@@ ner bo@@ x@@ es the air and k@@ is@@ ses the ground , th@@ ro@@ ws his sh@@ ir@@ t as though somebody is wa@@ iting for it ."
( Laughter ) And this guy has to come to the net .
"When he comes to the net , you see , his whole face changes ."
It looks as though he &apos;s wi@@ shing that he didn &apos;t w@@ in .
Why ? E@@ mp@@ a@@ thy .
That &apos;s human heart .
No human heart is d@@ en@@ i@@ ed of that emp@@ a@@ thy .
No religi@@ on can de@@ mo@@ lish that by in@@ doc@@ tr@@ in@@ ation .
"@@ No culture , no n@@ ation and nati@@ on@@ al@@ ism — nothing can tou@@ ch it because it is emp@@ a@@ thy ."
"And that cap@@ ac@@ ity to emp@@ a@@ th@@ ize is the w@@ in@@ d@@ ow through which you re@@ ach out to people , you do something that makes a difference in somebody &apos;s life — even words , even time ."
C@@ om@@ pas@@ sion is not defin@@ ed in one form .
There &apos;s no Indi@@ an compassion .
There &apos;s no American compassion .
"It tr@@ an@@ sc@@ ends n@@ ation , the gen@@ der , the age ."
Why ? Because it is there in everybody .
It &apos;s experienc@@ ed by people o@@ c@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally .
"Th@@ en this o@@ c@@ ca@@ si@@ onal compassion , we are not talking about — it will never re@@ ma@@ in o@@ c@@ ca@@ si@@ onal ."
"B@@ y m@@ and@@ ate , you cannot make a person compas@@ sion@@ ate ."
"You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase love me . &quot; &quot; L@@ ove is something you disco@@ ver ."
"It &apos;s not an action , but in the Eng@@ lish language , it is also an action ."
I will come to it later .
So one has got to disco@@ ver a certain wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess .
"I am going to c@@ ite the pos@@ sibi@@ lity of being whole , which is within our experience , everybody &apos;s experience ."
"In sp@@ ite of a very tra@@ gi@@ c life , one is happy in mom@@ ents which are very few and far between ."
"And the one who is happy , even for a s@@ l@@ ap@@ s@@ tic@@ k jo@@ ke , ac@@ cep@@ ts hi@@ m@@ self and also the sch@@ e@@ me of things in which one fin@@ ds on@@ es@@ el@@ f ."
"That means the whole universe , known things and un@@ known things ."
A@@ ll of them are t@@ ot@@ ally ac@@ cep@@ ted because you disco@@ ver your wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess in yourself .
"The sub@@ ject — &quot; &quot; me &quot; &quot; — and the ob@@ ject — the sch@@ e@@ me of things — f@@ use into on@@ en@@ ess , an experience no@@ body can say , &quot; &quot; I am d@@ en@@ i@@ ed of , &quot; &quot; an experience common to all and s@@ und@@ ry ."
"That experience con@@ fir@@ ms that , in sp@@ ite of all your lim@@ it@@ ations — all your wan@@ ts , desi@@ res , un@@ ful@@ fil@@ led , and the cre@@ d@@ it car@@ ds and lay@@ off@@ s and , fin@@ ally , bal@@ d@@ ness — you can be happy ."
But the ex@@ ten@@ sion of the logi@@ c is that you don &apos;t need to ful@@ f@@ ill your desi@@ re to be happy .
"You are the very happiness , the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess that you want to be ."
"There &apos;s no cho@@ ice in this : that only con@@ fir@@ ms the reality that the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess cannot be different from you , cannot be min@@ us you ."
It has got to be you .
You cannot be a part of wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess and still be whole .
"@@ Y@@ our moment of happiness re@@ ve@@ als that reality , that re@@ alization , that recogn@@ ition : &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ybe I am the whole ."
Ma@@ ybe the s@@ wa@@ m@@ i is right .
Ma@@ ybe the s@@ wa@@ m@@ i is right . &quot; &quot; You start your new life .
Th@@ en everything be@@ comes me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful .
I have no more reason to b@@ la@@ me my@@ self .
"If one has to b@@ la@@ me on@@ es@@ el@@ f , one has a million reas@@ ons pl@@ us many ."
"But if I say , in sp@@ ite of my body being lim@@ ited — if it is black it is not wh@@ ite , if it is wh@@ ite it is not black : body is lim@@ ited any which way you look at it . L@@ im@@ ited ."
"@@ Y@@ our kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge is lim@@ ited , health is lim@@ ited , and power is ther@@ e@@ fore lim@@ ited , and the che@@ er@@ ful@@ ness is going to be lim@@ ited ."
C@@ om@@ pas@@ sion is going to be lim@@ ited .
E@@ very@@ thing is going to be lim@@ it@@ less .
"You cannot comm@@ and compassion un@@ less you become lim@@ it@@ less , and no@@ body can become lim@@ it@@ less , ei@@ ther you are or you are not . P@@ eri@@ od ."
And there is no way of your being not lim@@ it@@ less too .
"@@ Y@@ our own experience re@@ ve@@ als , in sp@@ ite of all lim@@ it@@ ations , you are the whole ."
And the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess is the reality of you when you re@@ l@@ ate to the world .
It is love first .
"When you re@@ l@@ ate to the world , the d@@ y@@ na@@ mic man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess is , what we say , love ."
And itself be@@ comes compassion if the ob@@ ject that you re@@ l@@ ate to ev@@ o@@ kes that e@@ mo@@ tion .
"Th@@ en that again trans@@ for@@ ms into giving , into sh@@ ar@@ ing ."
You ex@@ pre@@ ss yourself because you have compassion .
"T@@ o disco@@ ver compassion , you need to be compas@@ sion@@ ate ."
"T@@ o disco@@ ver the cap@@ ac@@ ity to give and share , you need to be giving and sh@@ ar@@ ing ."
There is no sh@@ ort@@ c@@ ut : it is like s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing by s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing .
You learn s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing by s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing .
You cannot learn s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing on a fo@@ am mat@@ tre@@ ss and en@@ ter into water .
( Laughter ) You learn s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing by s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing . You learn c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing by c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing .
"You learn c@@ oo@@ king by c@@ oo@@ king , having some sy@@ mp@@ a@@ the@@ tic people around you to e@@ at what you c@@ ook ."
"( Laughter ) And , ther@@ e@@ fore , what I say , you have to fa@@ ke it and make it . ( Laughter )"
You need to .
M@@ y pre@@ de@@ c@@ ess@@ or me@@ ant that .
You have to act it out .
You have to act compas@@ sion@@ ately .
"There is no ver@@ b for compassion , but you have an ad@@ ver@@ b for compassion ."
That &apos;s interesting to me .
You act compas@@ sion@@ ately .
"But then , how to act compas@@ sion@@ ately if you don &apos;t have compassion ?"
That is where you fa@@ ke .
You fa@@ ke it and make it . This is the man@@ tra of the United States of America .
( Laughter ) You fa@@ ke it and make it .
"You act compas@@ sion@@ ately as though you have compassion : gr@@ ind your te@@ e@@ th , take all the supp@@ ort system ."
"If you know how to pr@@ ay , pr@@ ay ."
A@@ s@@ k for compassion .
Let me act compas@@ sion@@ ately .
Do it .
"You &apos;ll disco@@ ver compassion and also s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly a rela@@ tive compassion , and s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , perhaps if you get the right teach@@ ing , you &apos;ll disco@@ ver compassion is a d@@ y@@ na@@ mic man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of the reality of yourself , which is on@@ en@@ ess , wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess , and that &apos;s what you are ."

How does the news shape the way we see the world ?
Here &apos;s the world based on the way it looks — based on l@@ and@@ ma@@ ss .
And here &apos;s how news shap@@ es what Americ@@ ans see .
"This ma@@ p — ( Applause ) — this ma@@ p sho@@ ws the number of secon@@ ds that American ne@@ t@@ work and ca@@ ble news organiz@@ ations de@@ di@@ ca@@ ted to news stories , by country , in F@@ e@@ br@@ u@@ ary of 200@@ 7 — just one year ago ."
"Now , this was a mon@@ th when N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a ag@@ re@@ ed to dis@@ man@@ t@@ le its n@@ uc@@ lear fac@@ i@@ li@@ ties ."
There was ma@@ s@@ sive f@@ loo@@ ding in In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a .
"And in P@@ ar@@ is , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C rele@@ as@@ ed its study con@@ fir@@ m@@ ing man &apos;s imp@@ act on global war@@ m@@ ing ."
The U.S@@ . ac@@ coun@@ ted for 7@@ 9 percent of t@@ ot@@ al news co@@ verage .
"And when we take out the U.S@@ . and look at the re@@ ma@@ ining 2@@ 1 percent , we see a lot of I@@ ra@@ q — that &apos;s that big gre@@ en thing there — and little else ."
"The com@@ b@@ ined co@@ verage of R@@ us@@ si@@ a , China and India , for example , re@@ ach@@ ed just one percent ."
"When we an@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed all the news stories and re@@ mo@@ ved just one story , here &apos;s how the world looked ."
What was that story ? The de@@ ath of An@@ n@@ a N@@ ic@@ ole S@@ m@@ it@@ h .
"This story ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed every country ex@@ cept I@@ ra@@ q , and re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved 10 times the co@@ verage of the I@@ P@@ C@@ C rep@@ ort ."
"And the c@@ y@@ c@@ le continu@@ es ; as we all know , B@@ r@@ it@@ ne@@ y has lo@@ om@@ ed pretty lar@@ ge l@@ ately ."
"So , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?"
One reason is that news ne@@ t@@ works have re@@ duc@@ ed the number of their fore@@ i@@ gn bu@@ rea@@ us by half .
"A@@ side from on@@ e-@@ person A@@ B@@ C min@@ i@@ -@@ bu@@ rea@@ us in N@@ a@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i , New D@@ el@@ h@@ i and M@@ um@@ ba@@ i , there are no ne@@ t@@ work news bu@@ rea@@ us in all of A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , India or S@@ ou@@ th America — pl@@ ac@@ es that are home to more than two billion people ."
The reality is that co@@ ver@@ ing B@@ r@@ it@@ ne@@ y is che@@ ap@@ er .
And this l@@ ack of global co@@ verage is all the more dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing when we see where people go for news .
"@@ L@@ o@@ cal T@@ V news lo@@ oms lar@@ ge , and un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately only de@@ di@@ ca@@ tes 12 percent of its co@@ verage to inter@@ national news ."
And what about the we@@ b ?
The most pop@@ ular news s@@ it@@ es don &apos;t do much better .
"@@ L@@ a@@ st year , P@@ ew and the C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a J@@ -@@ S@@ ch@@ ool an@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed the 1@@ 4@@ ,000 stories that appe@@ ar@@ ed on Google Ne@@ ws &apos; fron@@ t p@@ age ."
"And they , in fact , co@@ ver@@ ed the same 2@@ 4 news ev@@ ents ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , a study in e-@@ cont@@ ent showed that much of global news from U.S@@ . news cre@@ at@@ ors is rec@@ y@@ c@@ led stories from the A@@ P w@@ ir@@ e ser@@ vic@@ es and Re@@ u@@ ters , and don &apos;t put things into a cont@@ ex@@ t that people can understand their connec@@ tion to it ."
"So , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today &apos;s college gra@@ du@@ ates , as well as less edu@@ ca@@ ted Americ@@ ans , know less about the world than their coun@@ ter@@ parts did 20 years ago ."
"And if you think it &apos;s simply because we are not interest@@ ed , you would be wrong ."
"In re@@ cent years , Americ@@ ans who say they cl@@ os@@ ely fol@@ low global news most of the time gre@@ w to over 50 percent ."
The real question : is this dist@@ or@@ ted wor@@ l@@ d@@ view what we want for Americ@@ ans in our increas@@ ing@@ ly inter@@ connec@@ ted world ?
I know we can do better .
And can we a@@ ff@@ or@@ d not to ? Thank you .
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
The dom@@ in@@ ant kind of s@@ no@@ b@@ ber@@ y that exist@@ s no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys is job s@@ no@@ b@@ ber@@ y .
I don &apos;t think we are partic@@ ul@@ arly materi@@ al@@ is@@ tic .
So that &apos;s another way in which something quite pos@@ itive can have a na@@ st@@ y k@@ ic@@ k@@ back .
"And it &apos;s , again , l@@ in@@ ked to something n@@ ice ."
And that makes fa@@ il@@ ure seem much more c@@ ru@@ shing .
"That &apos;s ex@@ h@@ il@@ ar@@ ating if you &apos;re doing well , and very c@@ ru@@ shing if you &apos;re not ."
"This idea that everybody de@@ ser@@ ves to get where they get to , I think it &apos;s a c@@ ra@@ z@@ y idea , comple@@ tely c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ."
"There are simply too many ran@@ dom fac@@ tors : ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents , ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents of b@@ ir@@ th , ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents of things dro@@ pp@@ ing on people &apos;s he@@ a@@ ds , il@@ l@@ ne@@ ss@@ es , et@@ c ."
"That is an un@@ known part of them , and we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be@@ have as though it is known ."

"It &apos;s an es@@ cap@@ e from our own com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , and our own d@@ ra@@ m@@ as ."
What I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is success and fa@@ il@@ ure .
"When we &apos;re told that b@@ an@@ king is a very re@@ spec@@ table profes@@ sion , a lot of us want to go into b@@ an@@ king ."
"When b@@ an@@ king is no longer so re@@ spec@@ table , we l@@ ose inter@@ est in b@@ an@@ king ."
"But what I really want to stre@@ ss is : by all means , success , y@@ es ."
But let &apos;s ac@@ cept the str@@ ang@@ en@@ ess of some of our ideas .
Thank you very much .
And it &apos;s a very hard l@@ ine to make .
I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
"Now I know we learned that in mat@@ h cla@@ ss , but now it &apos;s every@@ where in the culture — The X pri@@ ze , the X@@ -@@ F@@ il@@ es , P@@ ro@@ ject X , TE@@ D@@ x ."
Wh@@ ere &apos;d that come from ?
"A@@ b@@ out six years ago I decided that I would learn Ar@@ ab@@ ic , which turns out to be a su@@ pre@@ me@@ ly logical language ."
"T@@ o wr@@ ite a word or a ph@@ ra@@ se or a s@@ ent@@ ence in Ar@@ ab@@ ic is like c@@ ra@@ f@@ ting an equ@@ ation , because every part is extre@@ me@@ ly preci@@ se and car@@ ri@@ es a lot of information ."
That &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as W@@ est@@ er@@ n science and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics and engine@@ ering was really worked out in the first few cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es of the C@@ om@@ m@@ on E@@ r@@ a by the P@@ er@@ si@@ ans and the Ar@@ ab@@ s and the T@@ ur@@ ks .
This in@@ clu@@ des the little system in Ar@@ ab@@ ic called al@@ -@@ j@@ e@@ br@@ a .
And al@@ -@@ j@@ e@@ b@@ r r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly trans@@ l@@ ates to &quot; the system for re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ ing dis@@ par@@ ate parts . &quot;
A@@ l@@ -@@ j@@ e@@ b@@ r fin@@ ally came into Eng@@ lish as al@@ ge@@ br@@ a .
One example am@@ ong many .
The Ar@@ ab@@ ic t@@ ex@@ ts con@@ ta@@ ining this ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical w@@ is@@ dom fin@@ ally made their way to Eu@@ rop@@ e — which is to say S@@ pa@@ in — in the 1@@ 1@@ th and 1@@ 2@@ th cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some s@@ oun@@ ds in Ar@@ ab@@ ic that just don &apos;t make it through a Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an vo@@ ice bo@@ x without lots of pr@@ ac@@ tice .
T@@ r@@ ust me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the cul@@ pr@@ its .
"This is the le@@ t@@ ter S@@ H@@ een , and it makes the sound we think of as S@@ H — &quot; &quot; sh . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s also the very first le@@ t@@ ter of the word sh@@ al@@ an , which means &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; just like the the Eng@@ lish word &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; — some un@@ defin@@ ed , un@@ known thing ."
"Now in Ar@@ ab@@ ic , we can make this defin@@ ite by ad@@ ding the defin@@ ite ar@@ tic@@ le &quot; &quot; al . &quot; &quot; So this is al@@ -@@ sh@@ al@@ an — the un@@ known thing ."
"And this is a word that appe@@ ar@@ s thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out early ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics , such as this 1@@ 0@@ th century der@@ i@@ v@@ ation of pro@@ o@@ f@@ s ."
"The problem for the M@@ e@@ di@@ ev@@ al S@@ p@@ an@@ ish sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s who were t@@ asked with trans@@ l@@ ating this material is that the le@@ t@@ ter S@@ H@@ een and the word sh@@ al@@ an can &apos;t be r@@ en@@ der@@ ed into S@@ p@@ an@@ ish because S@@ p@@ an@@ ish doesn &apos;t have that S@@ H , that &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; sound ."
"So by con@@ v@@ en@@ tion , they cre@@ ated a ru@@ le in which they bor@@ ro@@ wed the C@@ K sound , &quot; &quot; ck &quot; &quot; sound , from the cla@@ s@@ sical G@@ re@@ e@@ k in the form of the le@@ t@@ ter K@@ a@@ i ."
"@@ L@@ ater when this material was trans@@ l@@ ated into a common Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an language , which is to say L@@ ati@@ n , they simply re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ed the G@@ re@@ e@@ k K@@ a@@ i with the L@@ ati@@ n X@@ ."
"And once that happened , once this material was in L@@ ati@@ n , it form@@ ed the bas@@ is for ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics t@@ ex@@ t@@ b@@ oo@@ ks for almost 6@@ 00 years ."
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the un@@ known ? X is the un@@ known
because you can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; in S@@ p@@ an@@ ish .
( Laughter ) And I thought that was wor@@ th sh@@ ar@@ ing .

"But actually it &apos;s my belie@@ f that the people who &apos;ve been tru@@ ly cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ing on this age of behavi@@ or , up until now , up until re@@ cent times , up until the last six months , the people who have been cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ing most on the age of behavi@@ or and the trans@@ national al@@ le@@ gi@@ anc@@ es , using di@@ g@@ ital acti@@ vi@@ s@@ m and other s@@ orts of b@@ ord@@ er@@ less techno@@ logi@@ es , those who &apos;ve been bene@@ f@@ iting from this have been extre@@ mi@@ sts ."
And that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on .
"Now I should know , because for 1@@ 3 years of my life , I was inv@@ olved in an extre@@ me I@@ s@@ la@@ mi@@ st organiz@@ ation ."
"And my story , my per@@ s@@ onal story , is tru@@ ly evi@@ dence for the age of behavi@@ or that I &apos;m at@@ te@@ mp@@ ting to el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate up@@ on here ."
"I was , by the way — I &apos;m an E@@ s@@ sex la@@ d , born and ra@@ ised in E@@ s@@ sex in the U.@@ K@@ ."
"A@@ t the age of 1@@ 7 , I was rec@@ ru@@ iting people from C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge Uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity to this organiz@@ ation ."
"Now that j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , and what took me from E@@ s@@ sex all the way across the world — by the way , we were la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing at democ@@ ra@@ tic acti@@ vi@@ sts ."
We f@@ el@@ t they were from the age of ye@@ ster@@ year .
I learned how to use e@@ ma@@ il from the extre@@ mi@@ st organiz@@ ation that I used .
"E@@ v@@ en@@ tually I was de@@ te@@ c@@ ted , of course , in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t ."
But the way in which I learned to use technology to my adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge was because I was within an extre@@ mi@@ st organiz@@ ation that was for@@ c@@ ed to think be@@ y@@ on@@ d the con@@ fin@@ es of the nati@@ on@@ -@@ state .
"So as I said , we looked to the st@@ at@@ us qu@@ o and ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ed it ."
And it &apos;s not just I@@ s@@ la@@ mi@@ st extre@@ mi@@ sts that did this .
A form of an@@ ti@@ -@@ I@@ s@@ la@@ m r@@ he@@ t@@ or@@ ic is also on the ri@@ se and it &apos;s trans@@ national .
And the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences that this is having is that it &apos;s a@@ ffec@@ ting the poli@@ tical c@@ lim@@ ate across Eu@@ rop@@ e .
Because the In@@ ter@@ net and connec@@ tion techno@@ logi@@ es are connec@@ ting them across the world .
"In certain countries , m@@ os@@ qu@@ e min@@ are@@ ts are being b@@ an@@ ned ."
"In others , k@@ os@@ her and hal@@ al me@@ at are being b@@ an@@ ned , as we spea@@ k ."
"And on the f@@ li@@ p side , we have trans@@ national I@@ s@@ la@@ mi@@ st extre@@ mi@@ sts doing the same thing across their own societies ."
And so they are po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts of par@@ o@@ ch@@ i@@ al@@ ism that are being connec@@ ted in a way that makes them feel like they are ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am .
Now that never would have been possible before .
"They would have f@@ el@@ t is@@ ol@@ ated , until these s@@ orts of techno@@ logi@@ es came around and connec@@ ted them in a way that made them feel part of a lar@@ ger ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on ."
Well I believe they &apos;re getting left far be@@ h@@ ind .
And I &apos;ll give you an example here at this st@@ age .
I@@ f any of you remem@@ bers the Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as D@@ ay bom@@ b p@@ lot : there &apos;s a man called An@@ war al@@ -@@ A@@ w@@ la@@ k@@ i .
"As an American ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en , e@@ th@@ n@@ ically a Y@@ e@@ men@@ i , in hi@@ ding cur@@ r@@ ently in Y@@ e@@ men , who in@@ sp@@ i@@ red a N@@ i@@ g@@ eri@@ an , son of the head of N@@ i@@ g@@ eri@@ a &apos;s national b@@ ank ."
"This N@@ i@@ g@@ eri@@ an stud@@ ent studi@@ ed in L@@ on@@ don , tra@@ ined in Y@@ e@@ men , bo@@ ar@@ ded a f@@ light in A@@ m@@ ster@@ d@@ am to att@@ ack America ."
"The O@@ ld m@@ ent@@ ality with a cap@@ ital O , as re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted by the nati@@ on@@ -@@ state , not yet fully into the age of behavi@@ or , not recogn@@ iz@@ ing the power of trans@@ national social move@@ ments , got left be@@ h@@ ind ."
And the Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as D@@ ay bom@@ ber almost su@@ c@@ ce@@ eded in att@@ ac@@ king the United States of America .
"A@@ ga@@ in with the example of the far right : that we find , ir@@ on@@ ically , x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ o@@ bi@@ c nati@@ on@@ al@@ ist@@ s are u@@ ti@@ li@@ zing the bene@@ f@@ its of glob@@ alization ."
So why are they su@@ c@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing ?
And why are democ@@ r@@ acy as@@ p@@ ir@@ an@@ ts f@@ all@@ ing be@@ h@@ ind ?
Well we need to understand the power of the social move@@ ments who understand this .
"And a social move@@ ment is comp@@ ri@@ sed , in my view , it &apos;s comp@@ ri@@ sed of four ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics ."
It &apos;s comp@@ ri@@ sed of ideas and n@@ ar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves and sy@@ m@@ b@@ ols and lead@@ ers .
"I &apos;ll talk you through one example , and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be a@@ w@@ are of , and that &apos;s the example of A@@ l@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a ."
"If I asked you to think of the ideas of A@@ l@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a , that &apos;s something that comes to your mind im@@ medi@@ ately ."
"I@@ n@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , the difference between ideas and n@@ ar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves : the idea is the cause that one beli@@ ev@@ es in ; and the n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive is the way to s@@ ell that cause — the pro@@ p@@ ag@@ and@@ a , if you like , of the cause ."
So the ideas and the n@@ ar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves of A@@ l@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a come to your mind im@@ medi@@ ately .
One of their lead@@ ers was k@@ il@@ led in P@@ a@@ k@@ istan rec@@ ently .
And that &apos;s the power of social move@@ ments .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , if I ask your min@@ ds to fo@@ c@@ us cur@@ r@@ ently on P@@ a@@ k@@ istan , and I ask you to think of the sy@@ m@@ b@@ ols and the lead@@ ers for democ@@ r@@ acy in P@@ a@@ k@@ istan today , you &apos;ll be hard press@@ ed to think be@@ y@@ on@@ d perhaps the as@@ s@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of B@@ en@@ a@@ z@@ ir B@@ hu@@ t@@ to ."
"Wh@@ ich means , by defin@@ ition , that particular lead@@ er no longer exist@@ s ."
"One of the problems we &apos;re fac@@ ing is , in my view , that there are no glob@@ alized , y@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ led , gr@@ as@@ s@@ ro@@ ots social move@@ ments ad@@ vo@@ ca@@ ting for democ@@ ra@@ tic culture across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity societies ."
"There is no equ@@ i@@ v@@ al@@ ent of the A@@ l@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a , without the ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , for democ@@ r@@ acy across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity societies ."
So that be@@ gs the next question .
And I believe that &apos;s for four reas@@ ons .
"I believe , number one , it &apos;s com@@ pl@@ ac@@ enc@@ y ."
And that level of com@@ pl@@ ac@@ enc@@ y means they don &apos;t feel the need to ad@@ vo@@ ca@@ te for that culture .
"The second , I believe , is poli@@ tical cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness ."
That we have a h@@ es@@ it@@ ation in es@@ p@@ ous@@ ing the univers@@ ality of democ@@ ra@@ tic culture because we are as@@ soci@@ ating that — we as@@ soci@@ ate beli@@ ev@@ ing in the univers@@ ality of our valu@@ es — with extre@@ mi@@ sts .
"@@ Y@@ et actually , wh@@ en@@ ever we talk about human ri@@ ghts , we do say that human ri@@ ghts are univers@@ al ."
But actually going out to pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ate that view is as@@ soci@@ ated with ei@@ ther ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ ati@@ vi@@ s@@ m or with I@@ s@@ la@@ mi@@ st extre@@ mis@@ m .
T@@ o go around saying that I believe democ@@ ra@@ tic culture is the best that we &apos;ve ar@@ ri@@ ved at as a form of poli@@ tical organiz@@ ing is as@@ soci@@ ated with extre@@ mis@@ m .
"And then you have a th@@ ir@@ d par@@ ty saying , &quot; V@@ ote for us ; we &apos;ll est@@ ab@@ lish a the@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ acy . &quot;"
"And what happens as a resul@@ t of this is , when those par@@ ties are elec@@ ted , and in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably they fa@@ il , or in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably they make poli@@ tical mi@@ sta@@ kes , democ@@ r@@ acy ta@@ kes the b@@ la@@ me for their poli@@ tical mi@@ sta@@ kes ."
"And then people say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve tried democ@@ r@@ acy . It doesn &apos;t really work ."
"When talking about those reas@@ ons , let &apos;s brea@@ k down certain pre@@ con@@ cep@@ tions ."
"A@@ nec@@ d@@ ot@@ ally , we can de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that if po@@ ver@@ ty was the only fac@@ tor , well B@@ in L@@ ad@@ en is from one of the ri@@ ch@@ est fami@@ lies in S@@ au@@ d@@ i Ar@@ ab@@ ia ."
"H@@ is de@@ pu@@ ty , A@@ y@@ man al@@ -@@ Z@@ a@@ wa@@ h@@ ir@@ i , was a pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ ci@@ an — not an il@@ l@@ -@@ edu@@ ca@@ ted man ."
"And what I believe is mi@@ ss@@ ing is gen@@ u@@ ine gr@@ as@@ s@@ ro@@ ots acti@@ vi@@ s@@ m on the ground , in ad@@ dition to inter@@ national a@@ id , in ad@@ dition to education , in ad@@ dition to health ."
"@@ No@@ t ex@@ clu@@ sive to these things , but in ad@@ dition to them , is pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ating a gen@@ u@@ ine de@@ m@@ and for democ@@ r@@ acy on the ground ."
And this is where I believe ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ ati@@ s@@ m had it up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down .
Ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ ati@@ s@@ m had the ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y that you go in with a su@@ p@@ pl@@ y-@@ led appro@@ ach to imp@@ ose democ@@ ra@@ tic valu@@ es from the top down .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as I@@ s@@ la@@ mi@@ sts and far@@ -@@ right organiz@@ ations , for de@@ ca@@ des , have been buil@@ ding de@@ m@@ and for their ide@@ o@@ logy on the gr@@ as@@ s@@ ro@@ ots ."
"M@@ as@@ s move@@ ments in P@@ a@@ k@@ istan have been re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted after the A@@ ra@@ b u@@ pri@@ s@@ ings ma@@ in@@ ly by organiz@@ ations cla@@ im@@ ing for some form of the@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ acy , rather than for a democ@@ ra@@ tic u@@ pri@@ sing ."
"Because since pre@@ -@@ par@@ ti@@ tion , they &apos;ve been buil@@ ding de@@ m@@ and for their ide@@ o@@ logy on the ground ."
And what &apos;s needed is a gen@@ u@@ ine trans@@ national y@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ led move@@ ment that works to acti@@ vely ad@@ vo@@ ca@@ te for the democ@@ ra@@ tic culture — which is nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly more than just elec@@ tions .
"What that will do is a@@ vo@@ id the problem I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er , where cur@@ r@@ ently we have poli@@ tical par@@ ties pres@@ ent@@ ing democ@@ r@@ acy as mer@@ ely a poli@@ tical cho@@ ice in those societies al@@ on@@ g@@ side other cho@@ ic@@ es such as mi@@ lit@@ ary ru@@ le and the@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ acy ."
"What we &apos;ll have in the end is this ide@@ al that you see on the sli@@ de here — the ide@@ al that people should v@@ ote in an exist@@ ing democ@@ r@@ acy , not for a democ@@ r@@ acy ."
"Now to con@@ clu@@ de , how does that happen ?"
"Well , E@@ g@@ yp@@ t is a good star@@ ting point ."
The A@@ ra@@ b u@@ pri@@ s@@ ings have de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated that this is already beginning .
But what happened in the A@@ ra@@ b u@@ pri@@ s@@ ings and what happened in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t was partic@@ ul@@ arly ca@@ th@@ ar@@ tic for me .
We need to move one ste@@ p be@@ y@@ on@@ d that now .
Because it &apos;s not enough to re@@ move a lead@@ er or r@@ ul@@ er or dic@@ t@@ at@@ or .
"And we &apos;ve made a start for that in P@@ a@@ k@@ istan with a move@@ ment called K@@ hu@@ d@@ i , where we are wor@@ king on the ground to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the y@@ ou@@ th to create gen@@ u@@ ine bu@@ y-@@ in for the democ@@ ra@@ tic culture ."
And it &apos;s with that thought that I &apos;ll end .
"And my time is up , and th@@ ank you for your time ."
"B@@ ack in New Y@@ or@@ k , I am the head of develop@@ ment for a n@@ on@@ -@@ prof@@ it called R@@ ob@@ in H@@ ood ."
"When I &apos;m not fi@@ gh@@ ting po@@ ver@@ ty , I &apos;m fi@@ gh@@ ting fi@@ res as the as@@ sist@@ ant cap@@ tain of a v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er fire comp@@ any ."
"Now in our to@@ wn , where the v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers supp@@ le@@ ment a high@@ ly sk@@ il@@ led car@@ e@@ er st@@ af@@ f , you have to get to the fire sc@@ en@@ e pretty early to get in on any action ."
I remem@@ ber my first fire .
"I was the second v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er on the sc@@ en@@ e , so there was a pretty good chan@@ ce I was going to get in ."
But still it was a real fo@@ ot@@ r@@ ace against the other v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in char@@ ge to find out what our as@@ sign@@ ments would be .
"When I found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very eng@@ ag@@ ing con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner , who was su@@ re@@ ly having one of the wor@@ st da@@ ys of her life ."
"@@ Here it was , the mi@@ ddle of the ni@@ ght , she was st@@ anding outside in the p@@ our@@ ing ra@@ in , under an um@@ b@@ re@@ l@@ l@@ a , in her pa@@ j@@ am@@ as , b@@ are@@ f@@ oo@@ t , while her h@@ ou@@ se was in f@@ la@@ m@@ es ."
The other v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er who had ar@@ ri@@ ved just before me — let &apos;s call him L@@ e@@ x L@@ u@@ ther — ( Laughter ) got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and sa@@ ve the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner &apos;s do@@ g .
The do@@ g ! I was st@@ un@@ ned with j@@ e@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
"@@ Here was some la@@ w@@ y@@ er or money man@@ ag@@ er who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a bur@@ ning buil@@ ding to sa@@ ve a li@@ ving cre@@ ature , just because he be@@ at me by five secon@@ ds ."
"Well , I was next ."
The cap@@ tain wa@@ ved me over .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Be@@ z@@ os , I need you to go into the h@@ ou@@ se ."
"I need you to go up@@ stair@@ s , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I swe@@ ar ."
"So , not ex@@ actly what I was hop@@ ing for , but off I went — up the stair@@ s , down the h@@ all , past the &apos; real &apos; fi@@ re@@ fi@@ gh@@ ters , who were pretty much done pu@@ tting out the fire at this point , into the ma@@ ster be@@ dro@@ om to get a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es ."
"Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no her@@ o ."
( Laughter ) I car@@ ri@@ ed my pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad back do@@ w@@ n@@ stair@@ s where I me@@ t my ne@@ mes@@ is and the preci@@ ous do@@ g by the fron@@ t do@@ or .
"We took our tre@@ as@@ ures outside to the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner , where , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , his re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved much more att@@ en@@ tion than did m@@ ine ."
"A few wee@@ ks later , the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved a le@@ t@@ ter from the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner th@@ an@@ king us for the v@@ ali@@ ant e@@ ff@@ ort di@@ sp@@ lay@@ ed in sa@@ ving her home ."
The act of kin@@ d@@ ness she n@@ ot@@ ed ab@@ ove all others : someone had even g@@ ot@@ ten her a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es .
"( Laughter ) In both my vo@@ cation at R@@ ob@@ in H@@ ood and my a@@ vo@@ cation as a v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er fi@@ re@@ fi@@ ghter , I am wit@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gener@@ os@@ ity and kin@@ d@@ ness on a mon@@ um@@ ental sc@@ ale , but I &apos;m also wit@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gr@@ ace and cou@@ ra@@ ge on an in@@ divi@@ du@@ al bas@@ is ."
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
They all matter .
"So as I look around this room at people who ei@@ ther have achi@@ ev@@ ed , or are on their way to achi@@ ev@@ ing , re@@ mark@@ able le@@ vel@@ s of success , I would off@@ er this re@@ min@@ der : don &apos;t wa@@ it ."
D@@ on &apos;t wa@@ it until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
"If you have something to give , give it now ."
S@@ er@@ ve f@@ ood at a s@@ ou@@ p k@@ it@@ ch@@ en . C@@ le@@ an up a ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood par@@ k .
B@@ e a m@@ ent@@ or .
"@@ No@@ t every day is going to off@@ er us a chan@@ ce to sa@@ ve somebody &apos;s life , but every day off@@ ers us an op@@ p@@ ort@@ unity to a@@ ffec@@ t one ."
So get in the ga@@ me . S@@ a@@ ve the sho@@ es .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) B@@ run@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ s@@ an@@ i : M@@ ark , M@@ ark , come back . ( Applause )"
M@@ ark Be@@ z@@ os : Thank you .
"M@@ ark Z@@ uc@@ k@@ er@@ ber@@ g , a j@@ ourn@@ ali@@ st was asking him a question about the news fe@@ ed ."
"And the j@@ ourn@@ ali@@ st was asking him , &quot; Why is this so important ? &quot;"
"And Z@@ uc@@ k@@ er@@ ber@@ g said , &quot; &quot; A s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l d@@ ying in your fron@@ t y@@ ard may be more rele@@ v@@ ant to your interest@@ s right now than people d@@ ying in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a . &quot; &quot; And I want to talk about what a W@@ e@@ b based on that idea of rele@@ v@@ ance might look like ."
"So when I was gro@@ wing up in a really r@@ ur@@ al are@@ a in Ma@@ ine , the In@@ ter@@ net me@@ ant something very different to me ."
It me@@ ant a connec@@ tion to the world .
It me@@ ant something that would con@@ ne@@ ct us all together .
And I was s@@ ure that it was going to be great for democ@@ r@@ acy and for our society .
"And if we don &apos;t p@@ ay att@@ en@@ tion to it , it could be a real problem ."
So I first no@@ tic@@ ed this in a place I sp@@ end a lot of time — my F@@ ace@@ book p@@ age .
"I &apos;m progre@@ s@@ sive , poli@@ tic@@ ally — big surpri@@ se — but I &apos;ve always g@@ one out of my way to me@@ et con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves ."
I like hear@@ ing what they &apos;re thinking about ; I like see@@ ing what they l@@ ink to ; I like learning a thing or two .
And so I was surpri@@ sed when I no@@ tic@@ ed one day that the con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves had dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed from my F@@ ace@@ book fe@@ ed .
"And what it turned out was going on was that F@@ ace@@ book was looking at which l@@ in@@ ks I c@@ li@@ c@@ ked on , and it was no@@ tic@@ ing that , actually , I was c@@ li@@ c@@ king more on my liber@@ al fri@@ ends &apos; l@@ in@@ ks than on my con@@ serv@@ ative fri@@ ends &apos; l@@ in@@ ks ."
"And without con@@ sul@@ ting me about it , it had ed@@ ited them out ."
They dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed .
"So F@@ ace@@ book isn &apos;t the only place that &apos;s doing this kind of in@@ vi@@ sible , al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mic ed@@ iting of the W@@ e@@ b ."
Google &apos;s doing it too .
"If I sear@@ ch for something , and you sear@@ ch for something , even right now at the very same time , we may get very different sear@@ ch results ."
Th@@ ink about it for a second : there is no st@@ and@@ ard Google any@@ more .
"And you know , the fun@@ n@@ y thing about this is that it &apos;s hard to see ."
You can &apos;t see how different your sear@@ ch results are from any@@ one else &apos;s .
So here &apos;s my fri@@ end S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s s@@ cre@@ en sho@@ t .
And here &apos;s my fri@@ end D@@ an@@ i@@ el &apos;s s@@ cre@@ en sho@@ t .
"When you put them si@@ de@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ side , you don &apos;t even have to read the l@@ in@@ ks to see how different these two p@@ ag@@ es are ."
"But when you do read the l@@ in@@ ks , it &apos;s really quite re@@ mark@@ able ."
D@@ an@@ i@@ el didn &apos;t get anything about the pr@@ ot@@ est@@ s in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t at all in his first p@@ age of Google results .
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s results were ful@@ l of them .
And this was the big story of the day at that time .
That &apos;s how different these results are be@@ coming .
So it &apos;s not just Google and F@@ ace@@ book ei@@ ther .
This is something that &apos;s s@@ wee@@ p@@ ing the W@@ e@@ b .
There are a whole h@@ ost of comp@@ an@@ ies that are doing this kind of per@@ s@@ on@@ alization .
"@@ Y@@ a@@ h@@ o@@ o Ne@@ ws , the big@@ gest news s@@ ite on the In@@ ter@@ net , is now per@@ s@@ on@@ alized — different people get different things ."
"H@@ u@@ ff@@ ing@@ ton P@@ ost , the W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton P@@ ost , the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es — all f@@ li@@ r@@ ting with per@@ s@@ on@@ alization in v@@ ari@@ ous ways ."
"And this mo@@ ves us very quic@@ kly to@@ ward a world in which the In@@ ter@@ net is sho@@ wing us what it thin@@ ks we want to see , but not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly what we need to see ."
"And I think , if you take all of these fil@@ ters together , you take all these al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms , you get what I call a fil@@ ter bub@@ ble ."
"And your fil@@ ter bub@@ ble is your own per@@ s@@ onal , uni@@ qu@@ e universe of information that you live in on@@ l@@ ine ."
"And what &apos;s in your fil@@ ter bub@@ ble dep@@ ends on who you are , and it dep@@ ends on what you do ."
But the thing is that you don &apos;t deci@@ de what gets in .
"And more import@@ an@@ tly , you don &apos;t actually see what gets ed@@ ited out ."
So one of the problems with the fil@@ ter bub@@ ble was disco@@ ver@@ ed by some resear@@ ch@@ ers at N@@ et@@ f@@ li@@ x .
"They en@@ ter the qu@@ e@@ u@@ e , they just z@@ i@@ p right out ."
"So &quot; &quot; I@@ r@@ on M@@ an &quot; &quot; z@@ i@@ ps right out , and &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ iting for Su@@ per@@ man &quot; &quot; can wa@@ it for a really long time ."
What they disco@@ ver@@ ed was that in our N@@ et@@ f@@ li@@ x qu@@ e@@ u@@ es there &apos;s this e@@ p@@ ic str@@ u@@ g@@ gle going on between our future as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tional selves and our more imp@@ ul@@ sive pres@@ ent selves .
"You know we all want to be someone who has wat@@ ched &quot; &quot; R@@ a@@ sh@@ om@@ on , &quot; &quot; but right now we want to wat@@ ch &quot; &quot; A@@ ce V@@ ent@@ ur@@ a &quot; &quot; for the f@@ our@@ th time ."
It gi@@ ves us a little bit of J@@ us@@ ti@@ n Bi@@ e@@ ber and a little bit of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan .
It gi@@ ves us some information ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les ; it gi@@ ves us some information de@@ s@@ ser@@ t .
"And the chall@@ en@@ ge with these kinds of al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mic fil@@ ters , these per@@ s@@ on@@ alized fil@@ ters , is that , because they &apos;re ma@@ in@@ ly looking at what you c@@ li@@ ck on first , it can th@@ row off that bal@@ ance ."
"And instead of a bal@@ anc@@ ed information di@@ et , you can end up sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by information j@@ un@@ k f@@ ood ."
But that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
What we &apos;re see@@ ing is more of a pas@@ sing of the t@@ or@@ ch from human g@@ at@@ e@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s to al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mic ones .
And the thing is that the al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms don &apos;t yet have the kind of em@@ be@@ d@@ ded e@@ th@@ ic@@ s that the ed@@ it@@ ors did .
"So if al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms are going to cur@@ ate the world for us , if they &apos;re going to deci@@ de what we get to see and what we don &apos;t get to see , then we need to make s@@ ure that they &apos;re not just ke@@ y@@ ed to rele@@ v@@ ance ."
We need to make s@@ ure that they also show us things that are un@@ com@@ for@@ table or chall@@ eng@@ ing or important — this is what TED does — other poin@@ ts of view .
"And the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society ."
"In 19@@ 15 , it &apos;s not like ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers were swe@@ ating a lot about their ci@@ vi@@ c respon@@ sibi@@ li@@ ties ."
Th@@ en people no@@ tic@@ ed that they were doing something really important .
"That , in fact , you cou@@ ldn &apos;t have a fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing democ@@ r@@ acy if ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens didn &apos;t get a good f@@ low of information , that the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers were cri@@ tical because they were ac@@ ting as the fil@@ ter , and then j@@ ourn@@ al@@ is@@ tic e@@ th@@ ic@@ s developed ."
"It was@@ n &apos;t per@@ fe@@ ct , but it got us through the last century ."
"And so now , we &apos;re kind of back in 19@@ 15 on the W@@ e@@ b ."
And we need the new g@@ at@@ e@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s to en@@ co@@ de that kind of respon@@ sibi@@ lity into the co@@ de that they &apos;re wr@@ iting .
"I know that there are a lot of people here from F@@ ace@@ book and from Google — L@@ ar@@ ry and S@@ er@@ ge@@ y — people who have hel@@ p@@ ed build the W@@ e@@ b as it is , and I &apos;m gr@@ at@@ e@@ ful for that ."
"But we really need you to make s@@ ure that these al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have en@@ co@@ ded in them a sense of the publi@@ c life , a sense of ci@@ vi@@ c respon@@ sibi@@ lity ."
We need you to make s@@ ure that they &apos;re trans@@ par@@ ent enough that we can see what the r@@ ul@@ es are that de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine what gets through our fil@@ ters .
And we need you to give us some contro@@ l so that we can deci@@ de what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
Because I think we really need the In@@ ter@@ net to be that thing that we all dre@@ am@@ ed of it being .
We need it to con@@ ne@@ ct us all together .
We need it to int@@ ro@@ duce us to new ideas and new people and different per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ves .
And it &apos;s not going to do that if it lea@@ ves us all is@@ ol@@ ated in a W@@ e@@ b of one .
Thank you .

"M@@ ore than car@@ s or the In@@ ter@@ net or even that little mo@@ bi@@ le de@@ v@@ ice we keep talking about , the technology you &apos;re using the most almost every day is this , your tu@@ sh ."
"@@ No@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys people are s@@ it@@ ting 9@@ .@@ 3 h@@ ours a day , which is more than we &apos;re s@@ le@@ e@@ p@@ ing , at 7@@ .@@ 7 h@@ ours ."
"S@@ it@@ ting is so incredi@@ b@@ ly pre@@ v@@ al@@ ent , we don &apos;t even question how much we &apos;re doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it doesn &apos;t even o@@ cc@@ ur to us that it &apos;s not o@@ kay ."
"In that way , s@@ it@@ ting has become the s@@ mo@@ king of our gener@@ ation ."
"O@@ f course there &apos;s health con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences to this , sc@@ ary ones , be@@ si@@ des the wa@@ ist ."
"Th@@ ings like brea@@ st c@@ anc@@ er and col@@ on c@@ anc@@ er are direc@@ tly ti@@ ed to our l@@ ack of phy@@ sical &#91; acti@@ vity &#93; , T@@ en percent in fact , on both of those ."
"S@@ i@@ x percent for heart disease , se@@ ven percent for t@@ yp@@ e 2 di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , which is what my father di@@ ed of ."
"Now , any of those st@@ at@@ s should con@@ v@@ in@@ ce each of us to get off our du@@ ff more , but if you &apos;re anything like me , it won &apos;t ."
What did get me mo@@ ving was a social inter@@ action .
"S@@ ome@@ one inv@@ ited me to a me@@ e@@ ting , but cou@@ ldn &apos;t man@@ age to f@@ it me in to a re@@ gu@@ lar sort of con@@ fer@@ ence room me@@ e@@ ting , and said , &quot; I have to wal@@ k my do@@ gs tom@@ or@@ row . C@@ ould you come then ? &quot;"
"It see@@ m@@ ed kind of o@@ d@@ d to do , and actually , that first me@@ e@@ ting , I remem@@ ber thinking , &quot; I have to be the one to ask the next question , &quot; because I knew I was going to hu@@ ff and pu@@ ff d@@ uring this con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"And yet , I &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own ."
"So instead of going to co@@ ff@@ e@@ e me@@ et@@ ings or flu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent@@ -@@ li@@ t con@@ fer@@ ence room me@@ et@@ ings , I ask people to go on a wal@@ king me@@ e@@ ting , to the t@@ un@@ e of 20 to 30 mil@@ es a wee@@ k ."
It &apos;s chang@@ ed my life .
"But before that , what actually happened was , I used to think about it as , you could take care of your health , or you could take care of ob@@ lig@@ ations , and one always came at the cost of the other ."
"So now , se@@ ver@@ al hundred of these wal@@ king me@@ et@@ ings later , I &apos;ve learned a few things ."
"F@@ irst , there &apos;s this a@@ ma@@ zing thing about actually getting out of the bo@@ x that lea@@ ds to out@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ x thinking ."
"Wh@@ ether it &apos;s nature or the ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se itself , it cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly works ."
"And second , and probably the more re@@ f@@ lec@@ tive one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in op@@ position when they &apos;re really not that way ."
"And if we &apos;re going to sol@@ ve problems and look at the world really differ@@ ently , whether it &apos;s in govern@@ ance or b@@ usiness or environ@@ mental is@@ su@@ es , job cre@@ ation , maybe we can think about how to re@@ f@@ ra@@ me those problems as having both things be true ."
Because it was when that happened with this wal@@ k@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ talk idea that things be@@ came do@@ able and su@@ sta@@ in@@ able and vi@@ able .
"So I started this talk talking about the tu@@ sh , so I &apos;ll end with the bot@@ tom l@@ ine , which is , wal@@ k and talk ."
W@@ al@@ k the talk .
"You &apos;ll be surpri@@ sed at how fre@@ sh air dri@@ ves fre@@ sh thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an enti@@ re@@ ly new set of ideas ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;d like to take you to another world .
"And I &apos;d like to share a 45 year@@ -@@ old love story with the poor , li@@ ving on less than one dol@@ lar a day ."
"I went to a very e@@ li@@ ti@@ st , s@@ no@@ b@@ bi@@ sh , exp@@ en@@ sive education in India , and that almost de@@ stro@@ y@@ ed me ."
"I was all set to be a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at , teacher , doc@@ tor — all la@@ id out ."
"Th@@ en , I don &apos;t look it , but I was the Indi@@ an national s@@ qu@@ as@@ h c@@ ha@@ mp@@ i@@ on for three years ."
( Laughter ) The whole world was la@@ id out for me .
E@@ very@@ thing was at my fe@@ et .
I could do nothing wrong .
And then I thought out of cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity I &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
"So in 19@@ 6@@ 5 , I went to what was called the wor@@ st Bi@@ ha@@ r fa@@ m@@ ine in India , and I saw star@@ v@@ ation , de@@ ath , people d@@ ying of h@@ un@@ ger , for the first time ."
It chang@@ ed my life .
"I came back home , told my mother , &quot; I &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;"
M@@ other went into a com@@ a .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What is this ?
"The whole world is la@@ id out for you , the best j@@ ob@@ s are la@@ id out for you , and you want to go and work in a village ?"
"I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve got the best ed@@ uc@@ tion ."
It made me think .
And I wanted to give something back in my own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
"@@ No job , no money , no se@@ cur@@ ity , no pr@@ os@@ pe@@ ct . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to live and di@@ g w@@ ells for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ i@@ g w@@ ells for five years ?"
"You went to the most exp@@ en@@ sive school and college in India , and you want to di@@ g w@@ ells for five years ? &quot; &quot; She didn &apos;t spea@@ k to me for a very long time , because she thought I &apos;d let my family down ."
"But then , I was ex@@ pos@@ ed to the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and sk@@ il@@ ls that very poor people have , which are never br@@ ought into the ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am — which is never i@@ d@@ enti@@ fied , re@@ spec@@ ted , app@@ li@@ ed on a lar@@ ge sc@@ ale ."
And I thought I &apos;d start a B@@ are@@ f@@ oo@@ t C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge — college only for the poor .
What the poor thought was important would be re@@ f@@ lec@@ ted in the college .
I went to this village for the first time .
"E@@ l@@ d@@ ers came to me and said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you run@@ ning from the poli@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You fa@@ il@@ ed in your ex@@ am ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot;"
"&quot; You didn &apos;t get a govern@@ ment job ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
The education system in India makes you look at P@@ ar@@ is and New D@@ el@@ h@@ i and Z@@ u@@ rich ; what are you doing in this village ?
"I@@ s there something wrong with you you &apos;re not t@@ elling us ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to actually start a college only for the poor ."
What the poor thought was important would be re@@ f@@ lec@@ ted in the college . &quot; &quot; So the el@@ d@@ ers gave me some very sound and pro@@ found adv@@ ice .
"They said , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase , don &apos;t bring any@@ one with a de@@ g@@ ree and qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ cation into your college . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s the only college in India where , if you should have a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . or a Ma@@ ster &apos;s , you are dis@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied to come ."
You have to be a cop@@ -@@ out or a wa@@ sh@@ -@@ out or a d@@ rop@@ out to come to our college .
You have to work with your h@@ ands .
You have to have a di@@ gn@@ ity of l@@ ab@@ or .
You have to show that you have a sk@@ ill that you can off@@ er to the comm@@ unity and pro@@ vi@@ de a serv@@ ice to the comm@@ unity .
"So we started the B@@ are@@ f@@ oo@@ t C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , and we re@@ defin@@ ed profes@@ sion@@ al@@ ism ."
Wh@@ o is a profes@@ si@@ onal ?
"A profes@@ si@@ onal is someone who has a com@@ b@@ in@@ ation of com@@ pe@@ t@@ ence , con@@ fi@@ dence and belie@@ f ."
A water di@@ v@@ in@@ er is a profes@@ si@@ onal .
A tra@@ di@@ tional mi@@ d@@ wi@@ fe is a profes@@ si@@ onal .
A tra@@ di@@ tional b@@ one se@@ t@@ ter is a profes@@ si@@ onal .
These are profes@@ sion@@ als all over the world .
You find them in any in@@ acc@@ es@@ sible village around the world .
And we thought that these people should come into the ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am and show that the kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and sk@@ il@@ ls that they have is univers@@ al .
"It ne@@ e@@ ds to be used , ne@@ e@@ ds to be app@@ li@@ ed , ne@@ e@@ ds to be sho@@ wn to the world outside — that these kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and sk@@ il@@ ls are rele@@ v@@ ant even today ."
So the college works fol@@ lo@@ wing the li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le and wor@@ k@@ st@@ y@@ le of Ma@@ h@@ at@@ m@@ a G@@ and@@ h@@ i .
"You e@@ at on the f@@ lo@@ or , you s@@ le@@ ep on the f@@ lo@@ or , you work on the f@@ lo@@ or ."
"There are no con@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts , no wr@@ it@@ ten con@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts ."
"You can st@@ ay with me for 20 years , go tom@@ or@@ row ."
And no one can get more than $ 100 a mon@@ th .
"You come for the money , you don &apos;t come to B@@ are@@ f@@ oo@@ t C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"You come for the work and the chall@@ en@@ ge , you &apos;ll come to the B@@ are@@ f@@ oo@@ t C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
That is where we want you to try c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ideas .
"Wh@@ at@@ ever idea you have , come and try it ."
It doesn &apos;t matter if you fa@@ il .
"B@@ at@@ ter@@ ed , br@@ u@@ ised , you start again ."
It &apos;s the only college where the teacher is the lear@@ ner and the lear@@ ner is the teacher .
And it &apos;s the only college where we don &apos;t give a cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ te .
You are cer@@ ti@@ fied by the comm@@ unity you ser@@ ve .
You don &apos;t need a p@@ ap@@ er to h@@ ang on the w@@ all to show that you are an engine@@ er .
"So when I said that , they said , &quot; &quot; Well show us what is possible . What are you doing ?"
This is all m@@ um@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ um@@ b@@ o if you can &apos;t show it on the ground . &quot; &quot; So we built the first B@@ are@@ f@@ oo@@ t C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in 19@@ 8@@ 6 .
"It was built by 12 B@@ are@@ f@@ oo@@ t ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts who can &apos;t read and wr@@ ite , built on $ 1@@ .@@ 50 a s@@ q@@ . ft ."
"@@ 150 people li@@ ved there , worked there ."
They got the A@@ g@@ a K@@ ha@@ n A@@ ward for Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture in 200@@ 2 .
"But then they su@@ spec@@ ted , they thought there was an ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ t be@@ h@@ ind it ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , they made the b@@ lu@@ e@@ pr@@ in@@ ts , but the B@@ are@@ f@@ oo@@ t ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts actually con@@ struc@@ ted the college . &quot; &quot; We are the only ones who actually re@@ turned the a@@ ward for $ 5@@ 0,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually ca@@ st@@ ing as@@ per@@ sions on the B@@ are@@ f@@ oo@@ t ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts of T@@ il@@ on@@ ia ."
"I asked a fore@@ ster — high@@ -@@ po@@ wer@@ ed , p@@ ap@@ er@@ -@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied ex@@ per@@ t — I said , &quot; &quot; What can you build in this place ? &quot; &quot; He had one look at the so@@ il and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ get it . No way ."
No@@ t even wor@@ th it .
"@@ No water , ro@@ c@@ k@@ y so@@ il . &quot; &quot; I was in a bit of a sp@@ o@@ t ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , I &apos;ll go to the old man in village and say , &apos; What should I grow in this sp@@ o@@ t ? &apos; &quot; &quot; He looked qui@@ e@@ tly at me and said , &quot; You build this , you build this , you put this , and it &apos;ll work . &quot;"
This is what it looks like today .
"@@ W@@ ent to the ro@@ of , and all the women said , &quot; &quot; C@@ lear out ."
The men should c@@ lear out because we don &apos;t want to share this technology with the men .
"This is wat@@ er@@ pro@@ o@@ f@@ ing the ro@@ of . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It is a bit of j@@ ag@@ g@@ ery , a bit of ur@@ ens and a bit of other things I don &apos;t know ."
But it actually doesn &apos;t lea@@ k .
"S@@ in@@ ce 19@@ 8@@ 6 , it ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t lea@@ ked ."
"This technology , the women will not share with the men ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the only college which is fully sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied .
A@@ ll the power comes from the su@@ n .
45 k@@ il@@ o@@ wat@@ ts of p@@ an@@ el@@ s on the ro@@ of .
And everything works off the su@@ n for the next 2@@ 5 years .
"So long as the su@@ n sh@@ ines , we &apos;ll have no problem with power ."
"But the beau@@ ty is that is was inst@@ all@@ ed by a pri@@ est , a H@@ in@@ d@@ u pri@@ est , who &apos;s only done eight years of pri@@ mar@@ y scho@@ ol@@ ing — never been to school , never been to college ."
He kno@@ ws more about solar than any@@ one I know any@@ where in the world gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed .
"F@@ ood , if you come to the B@@ are@@ f@@ oo@@ t C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , is solar c@@ oo@@ ked ."
"But the people who f@@ ab@@ ri@@ ca@@ ted that solar c@@ oo@@ ker are women , illi@@ ter@@ ate women , who actually f@@ ab@@ ri@@ ca@@ te the most s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ ca@@ ted solar c@@ oo@@ ker ."
It &apos;s a par@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ c S@@ che@@ ff@@ l@@ er solar c@@ oo@@ ker .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately , they &apos;re almost half G@@ er@@ man , they &apos;re so preci@@ se ."
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll never find Indi@@ an women so preci@@ se .
"A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely to the last in@@ ch , they can make that c@@ oo@@ ker ."
And we have 60 me@@ als tw@@ ice a day of solar c@@ oo@@ king .
"We have a d@@ enti@@ st — she &apos;s a grand@@ mother , illi@@ ter@@ ate , who &apos;s a d@@ enti@@ st ."
"She actually looks after the te@@ e@@ th of 7@@ ,000 children ."
"B@@ are@@ f@@ oo@@ t technology : this was 19@@ 8@@ 6 — no engine@@ er , no ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ t thought of it — but we are col@@ lec@@ ting ra@@ in@@ water from the ro@@ o@@ f@@ s ."
V@@ ery little water is wa@@ st@@ ed .
"A@@ ll the ro@@ o@@ f@@ s are connec@@ ted under@@ ground to a 4@@ 00@@ ,000 li@@ ter t@@ ank , and no water is wa@@ st@@ ed ."
"If we have four years of dr@@ ought , we still have water on the ca@@ mp@@ us , because we colle@@ ct ra@@ in@@ water ."
"@@ 60 percent of children don &apos;t go to school , because they have to look after an@@ im@@ als — sh@@ e@@ ep , go@@ at@@ s — domestic cho@@ res ."
So we thought of star@@ ting a school at ni@@ ght for the children .
"Because the ni@@ ght scho@@ ols of T@@ il@@ on@@ ia , over 7@@ 5@@ ,000 children have g@@ one through these ni@@ ght scho@@ ols ."
Because it &apos;s for the con@@ v@@ en@@ i@@ ence of the child ; it &apos;s not for the con@@ v@@ en@@ i@@ ence of the teacher .
And what do we te@@ ach in these scho@@ ols ?
"D@@ e@@ moc@@ r@@ acy , ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ ship , how you should measure your land , what you should do if you &apos;re ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed , what you should do if your an@@ im@@ al is sic@@ k ."
This is what we te@@ ach in the ni@@ ght scho@@ ols .
But all the scho@@ ols are sol@@ ar@@ -@@ li@@ t .
E@@ very five years we have an elec@@ tion .
"@@ Be@@ tween six to 14 year@@ -@@ old children par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in a democ@@ ra@@ tic process , and they elec@@ t a pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er ."
The pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er is 12 years old .
"She looks after 20 go@@ at@@ s in the mor@@ ning , but she &apos;s pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er in the even@@ ing ."
"She has a ca@@ b@@ in@@ et , a min@@ ist@@ er of education , a min@@ ist@@ er for energy , a min@@ ist@@ er for health ."
"And they actually mon@@ it@@ or and super@@ vi@@ se 150 scho@@ ols for 7@@ ,000 children ."
"She got the World &apos;s Ch@@ ildren &apos;s P@@ ri@@ ze five years ago , and she went to S@@ wed@@ en ."
F@@ irst time ever going out of her village .
N@@ ever se@@ en S@@ wed@@ en .
W@@ as@@ n &apos;t da@@ z@@ z@@ led at all by what was happening .
"And the Q@@ u@@ een of S@@ wed@@ en , who &apos;s there , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you ask this child where she got her con@@ fi@@ dence from ?"
"She &apos;s only 12 years old , and she &apos;s not da@@ z@@ z@@ led by anything . &quot; &quot; And the girl , who &apos;s on her left , turned to me and looked at the qu@@ een stra@@ ight in the ey@@ e and said , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase tell her I &apos;m the pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Wh@@ ere the per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of illi@@ ter@@ acy is very high , we use pu@@ p@@ pe@@ try ."
P@@ up@@ pe@@ ts is the way we comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ te .
You have Jo@@ k@@ him Ch@@ ach@@ a who is 3@@ 00 years old .
He is my psycho@@ an@@ al@@ y@@ st . He is my teacher .
He &apos;s my doc@@ tor . He &apos;s my la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
He &apos;s my d@@ on@@ or .
"He actually ra@@ is@@ es money , sol@@ ves my di@@ sp@@ u@@ tes ."
He sol@@ ves my problems in the village .
"If there &apos;s ten@@ sion in the village , if att@@ end@@ ance at the scho@@ ols goes down and there &apos;s a fri@@ c@@ tion between the teacher and the par@@ ent , the pu@@ p@@ pe@@ t call@@ s the teacher and the par@@ ent in fron@@ t of the whole village and says , &quot; &quot; S@@ ha@@ ke h@@ ands ."
The att@@ end@@ ance must not dro@@ p . &quot; &quot; These pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts are made out of rec@@ y@@ c@@ led World B@@ ank rep@@ orts .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this de@@ cen@@ tr@@ alized , de@@ my@@ sti@@ fied appro@@ ach of sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ f@@ ying villa@@ g@@ es , we &apos;ve co@@ ver@@ ed all over India from L@@ ad@@ a@@ k@@ h up to B@@ hu@@ t@@ an — all sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied villa@@ g@@ es by people who have been tra@@ ined ."
"And we went to L@@ ad@@ a@@ k@@ h , and we asked this woman — this , at min@@ us 40 , you have to come out of the ro@@ of , because there &apos;s no place , it was all s@@ no@@ wed up on both si@@ des — and we asked this woman , &quot; &quot; What was the bene@@ f@@ it you had from solar electri@@ c@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; And she thought for a minu@@ te and said , &quot; It &apos;s the first time I can see my h@@ us@@ b@@ and &apos;s face in w@@ in@@ ter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) W@@ ent to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan .
One le@@ s@@ son we learned in India was men are un@@ tra@@ in@@ able .
"( Laughter ) M@@ en are re@@ st@@ less , men are am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous , men are comp@@ ul@@ si@@ vely mo@@ bi@@ le , and they all want a cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ te . ( Laughter )"
"A@@ ll across the g@@ lo@@ be , you have this t@@ end@@ enc@@ y of men wan@@ ting a cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ te ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because they want to lea@@ ve the village and go to a c@@ ity , looking for a job ."
So we came up with a great s@@ olution : tra@@ in grand@@ mo@@ thers .
What &apos;s the best way of comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ ting in the world today ?
T@@ el@@ evi@@ sion ? No .
T@@ el@@ e@@ grap@@ h ? No .
T@@ el@@ e@@ ph@@ one ? No .
T@@ ell a woman .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we went to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the first time , and we pic@@ ked three women and said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; I@@ mp@@ os@@ sible . They don &apos;t even go out of their ro@@ oms , and you want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make a con@@ c@@ es@@ sion . I &apos;ll take the h@@ us@@ b@@ ands along as well . &quot; &quot; So I took the h@@ us@@ b@@ ands along ."
"O@@ f course , the women were much more intellig@@ ent than the men ."
"In six months , how do we tra@@ in these women ?"
S@@ i@@ gn language .
You don &apos;t cho@@ ose the wr@@ it@@ ten word .
You don &apos;t cho@@ ose the sp@@ o@@ ken word .
You use si@@ gn language .
And in six months they can become solar engine@@ ers .
They go back and sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ f@@ y their own village .
"This woman went back and sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied the first village , set up a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p — the first village ever to be sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan &#91; was &#93; by the three women . This wom@@ an@@ "
is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary grand@@ mother .
"@@ 5@@ 5 years old , and she &apos;s sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied 200 h@@ ous@@ es for me in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan ."
And they ha@@ ven &apos;t col@@ l@@ ap@@ sed .
She actually went and sp@@ o@@ ke to an engine@@ ering de@@ par@@ t@@ ment in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan and told the head of the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment the difference between A@@ C and D@@ C .
He didn &apos;t know .
Th@@ ose three women have tra@@ ined 2@@ 7 more women and sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied 100 villa@@ g@@ es in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ istan .
"We went to A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , and we did the same thing ."
"A@@ ll these women s@@ it@@ ting at one table from eight , n@@ ine countries , all ch@@ at@@ ting to each other , not underst@@ anding a word , because they &apos;re all spea@@ king a different language ."
But their body language is great .
They &apos;re spea@@ king to each other and actually be@@ coming solar engine@@ ers .
"I went to S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a L@@ e@@ one , and there was this min@@ ist@@ er dri@@ ving down in the de@@ ad of ni@@ ght — comes across this village ."
"C@@ om@@ es back , goes into the village , says , &quot; &quot; Well what &apos;s the story ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; These two grand@@ mo@@ thers ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ r@@ and@@ mo@@ thers ? &quot; &quot; The min@@ ist@@ er cou@@ ldn &apos;t believe what was happening ."
&quot; Wh@@ ere did they go ? &quot; &quot; W@@ ent to India and back . &quot;
W@@ ent stra@@ ight to the pre@@ si@@ dent .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know there &apos;s a sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied village in S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a L@@ e@@ one ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; H@@ al@@ f the ca@@ b@@ in@@ et went to see the grand@@ mo@@ thers the next day ."
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
"So he su@@ m@@ mon@@ ed me and said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you tra@@ in me 150 grand@@ mo@@ thers ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t , M@@ r@@ . P@@ re@@ si@@ dent ."
But they will . The grand@@ mo@@ thers will . &quot; &quot; So he built me the first B@@ are@@ f@@ oo@@ t tra@@ ining cen@@ ter in S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a L@@ e@@ one .
And 150 grand@@ mo@@ thers have been tra@@ ined in S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a L@@ e@@ one .
G@@ am@@ bi@@ a : we went to sel@@ ec@@ t a grand@@ mother in G@@ am@@ bi@@ a .
W@@ ent to this village .
I knew which woman I would like to take .
"The comm@@ unity got together and said , &quot; &quot; T@@ a@@ ke these two women . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to take this woman . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Why ? She doesn &apos;t know the language . You don &apos;t know her . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I like the body language . I like the way she spea@@ ks . &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ i@@ ff@@ ic@@ ult h@@ us@@ b@@ and ; not possible . &quot;"
"C@@ all@@ ed the h@@ us@@ b@@ and , the h@@ us@@ b@@ and came , s@@ w@@ ag@@ g@@ ering , poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an , mo@@ bi@@ le in his hand . &quot; &quot; No@@ t possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; The woman , look how beautiful she is . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h , she is very beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; What happens if she run@@ s off with an Indi@@ an man ? &quot;"
That was his big@@ gest fe@@ ar .
"I said , &quot; &quot; She &apos;ll be happy . She &apos;ll r@@ ing you up on the mo@@ bi@@ le . &quot; &quot; She went like a grand@@ mother and came back like a ti@@ ger ."
She wal@@ ked out of the plan@@ e and sp@@ o@@ ke to the whole pre@@ ss as if she was a ve@@ ter@@ an .
"She h@@ and@@ led the national pre@@ ss , and she was a star ."
"And when I went back six months later , I said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere &apos;s your h@@ us@@ b@@ and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , some@@ where . It doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) S@@ uc@@ c@@ ess story . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) I &apos;ll just w@@ ind up by saying that I think you don &apos;t have to look for solu@@ tions outside .
L@@ ook for solu@@ tions within .

B@@ .@@ J@@ . was one of many f@@ ell@@ ow in@@ mat@@ es who had big pl@@ ans for the future .
"He had a vi@@ sion . Wh@@ en he got out , he was going to lea@@ ve the d@@ op@@ e ga@@ me for good and f@@ ly stra@@ ight , and he was actually wor@@ king on mer@@ g@@ ing his two pas@@ sions into one vi@@ sion ."
"He &apos;d sp@@ ent 1@@ 0,000 dollars to buy a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite that ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely fe@@ at@@ u@@ red women having sex on top of or inside of lu@@ x@@ ury sp@@ orts car@@ s . ( Laughter ) It was my first wee@@ k in fe@@ der@@ al pri@@ son , and I was learning quic@@ kly that it was@@ n &apos;t what you see on T@@ V ."
"In fact , it was te@@ em@@ ing with s@@ mar@@ t , am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous men wh@@ ose b@@ usiness inst@@ in@@ c@@ ts were in many ca@@ ses as sh@@ ar@@ p as those of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had w@@ ined and d@@ ined me six months ear@@ li@@ er when I was a ri@@ sing star in the M@@ is@@ sour@@ i S@@ en@@ ate ."
"Now , 9@@ 5 percent of the gu@@ ys that I was loc@@ ked up with had been dru@@ g de@@ al@@ ers on the outside , but when they tal@@ ked about what they did , they tal@@ ked about it in a different j@@ ar@@ g@@ on , but the b@@ usiness con@@ cep@@ ts that they tal@@ ked about wer@@ en &apos;t un@@ like those that you &apos;d learn in a first year M@@ B@@ A cla@@ ss at Wh@@ ar@@ ton : pr@@ om@@ o@@ tional in@@ c@@ enti@@ ves , you never char@@ ge a fir@@ st@@ -@@ time us@@ er , fo@@ c@@ us@@ -@@ grou@@ p@@ ing new produc@@ t la@@ un@@ ch@@ es , ter@@ r@@ it@@ ori@@ al exp@@ an@@ sion ."
But they didn &apos;t sp@@ end a lot of time reli@@ ving the g@@ l@@ ory da@@ ys .
"For the most part , everyone was just trying to survi@@ ve ."
It &apos;s a lot har@@ der than you might think .
"C@@ on@@ tr@@ ary to what most people think , people don &apos;t p@@ ay , ta@@ x@@ pa@@ y@@ ers don &apos;t p@@ ay , for your life when you &apos;re in pri@@ son . You &apos;ve got to p@@ ay for your own life ."
"You &apos;ve got to p@@ ay for your so@@ a@@ p , your de@@ o@@ d@@ or@@ ant , too@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h , too@@ th@@ pa@@ st@@ e , all of it ."
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reas@@ ons .
"F@@ irst , everything &apos;s mar@@ ked up 30 to 50 percent from what you &apos;d p@@ ay on the stre@@ et , and second , you don &apos;t make a lot of money ."
"I un@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed tr@@ uc@@ ks . That was my ful@@ l@@ -@@ time job , un@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing tr@@ uc@@ ks at a f@@ ood war@@ e@@ h@@ ou@@ se , for $ 5@@ .@@ 2@@ 5 , not an h@@ our , but per mon@@ th ."
So how do you survi@@ ve ?
"Well , you learn to hu@@ st@@ le , all kinds of hu@@ st@@ les ."
There &apos;s le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les .
You p@@ ay everything in sta@@ mp@@ s . Th@@ ose are the cur@@ r@@ enc@@ y .
You char@@ ge another in@@ m@@ ate to c@@ le@@ an his cell .
"There &apos;s sort of il@@ le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les , like you ru@@ n a b@@ ar@@ ber@@ sho@@ p out of your cell ."
There &apos;s pretty il@@ le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les : You ru@@ n a t@@ at@@ too par@@ l@@ or out of your own cell .
"And there &apos;s very il@@ le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les , which you sm@@ u@@ g@@ gle in , you get sm@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ led in , dru@@ gs , p@@ or@@ no@@ grap@@ h@@ y , cell ph@@ ones , and just as in the ou@@ ter world , there &apos;s a ri@@ sk@@ -@@ re@@ ward tra@@ de@@ off , so the ri@@ sk@@ i@@ er the en@@ ter@@ pri@@ se , the more prof@@ it@@ able it can p@@ ot@@ enti@@ ally be ."
You want a ci@@ g@@ are@@ tt@@ e in pri@@ son ? Th@@ ree to five dollars .
You want an ol@@ d@@ -@@ fa@@ shi@@ on@@ ed cell ph@@ one that you f@@ li@@ p op@@ en and is about as big as your head ? Th@@ ree hundred b@@ uc@@ ks .
You want a di@@ r@@ ty mag@@ a@@ z@@ ine ?
"Well , it can be as much as 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"So as you can probably tell , one of the defin@@ ing as@@ pe@@ c@@ ts of pri@@ son life is ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity ."
"Wh@@ ether it was con@@ co@@ c@@ ting de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous me@@ als from st@@ ol@@ en sc@@ r@@ aps from the war@@ e@@ h@@ ou@@ se , sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ting people &apos;s ha@@ ir with to@@ en@@ a@@ il c@@ li@@ p@@ per@@ s , or con@@ struc@@ ting we@@ i@@ ghts from b@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ ers in la@@ und@@ ry b@@ ag@@ s ti@@ ed on to t@@ ree lim@@ b@@ s , pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity that they &apos;ve learned to the outside and start re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts , b@@ ar@@ ber sh@@ op@@ s , per@@ s@@ onal tra@@ ining b@@ us@@ in@@ ess@@ es ."
"But there &apos;s no tra@@ ining , nothing to pre@@ p@@ are them for that , no re@@ ha@@ bi@@ li@@ ta@@ tion at all in pri@@ son , no one to help them wr@@ ite a b@@ usiness pl@@ an , fig@@ ure out a way to trans@@ l@@ ate the b@@ usiness con@@ cep@@ ts they in@@ tu@@ i@@ tively gr@@ as@@ p into le@@ g@@ al en@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses , no acc@@ ess to the In@@ ter@@ net , even ."
"And then , when they come out , most st@@ ates don &apos;t even have a la@@ w pro@@ hi@@ b@@ iting emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers from di@@ scri@@ min@@ ating against people with a bac@@ k@@ ground ."
So n@@ one of us should be surpri@@ sed that two out of three ex@@ -@@ off@@ end@@ ers re@@ -@@ off@@ end within five years .
"@@ L@@ ook , I li@@ ed to the F@@ e@@ ds . I l@@ ost a year of my life from it ."
"But when I came out , I vo@@ wed that I was going to do wh@@ at@@ ever I could to make s@@ ure that gu@@ ys like the ones I was loc@@ ked up with didn &apos;t have to wa@@ st@@ e any more of their life than they already had ."
So I hop@@ e that you &apos;ll think about hel@@ p@@ ing in some way .
"The best thing we can do is fig@@ ure out ways to n@@ ur@@ ture the ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ u@@ ri@@ al sp@@ ir@@ it and the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous un@@ t@@ app@@ ed p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al in our pri@@ s@@ ons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new sk@@ il@@ ls that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back ."
A@@ ll they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hu@@ st@@ les .
Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m here because I have a very important mes@@ sage : I think we have found the most important fac@@ tor for success .
"And it was found cl@@ ose to here , St@@ an@@ for@@ d ."
"And he would tell the child , a f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old k@@ id , &quot; &quot; Jo@@ h@@ n@@ n@@ y , I am going to lea@@ ve you here with a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ ow for 15 minutes ."
"If , after I come back , this mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ ow is here , you will get another one . So you will have two . &quot; &quot; T@@ o tell a f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old k@@ id to wa@@ it 15 minutes for something that they like , is equ@@ i@@ v@@ al@@ ent to t@@ elling us , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll bring you co@@ ff@@ e@@ e in two h@@ ours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ x@@ act equ@@ i@@ v@@ al@@ ent ."
So what happened when the prof@@ ess@@ or left the room ?
A@@ s so@@ on as the do@@ or cl@@ osed ...
two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ ow .
"F@@ i@@ ve secon@@ ds , 10 secon@@ ds , 40 secon@@ ds , 50 secon@@ ds , two minutes , four minutes , eight minutes ."
S@@ ome la@@ st@@ ed 1@@ 4@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half minutes .
( Laughter ) C@@ ouldn &apos;t do it . C@@ ould not wa@@ it .
What &apos;s interesting is that one out of three would look at the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ ow and go like this ...
W@@ ould look at it .
P@@ ut it back .
They would wal@@ k around . They would pl@@ ay with their sk@@ ir@@ ts and p@@ an@@ ts .
"That child already , at four , underst@@ ood the most important pr@@ inci@@ ple for success , which is the ab@@ i@@ lity to d@@ el@@ ay gra@@ ti@@ fi@@ cation ."
"@@ 15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , fol@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ up study ."
What did they find ?
They went to look for these kids who were now 1@@ 8 and 1@@ 9 .
They were happy . They had their pl@@ ans .
"They had good relation@@ shi@@ ps with the teachers , students ."
They were doing f@@ ine .
"A great per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of the kids that ate the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ ow , they were in tr@@ ou@@ ble ."
They did not make it to univers@@ ity .
They had bad gra@@ des . S@@ ome of them dro@@ pp@@ ed out .
And let me show you what happened .
"H@@ i@@ sp@@ an@@ ic kids , two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ ow ; one out of three did not ."
This little girl was interesting ; she ate the inside of the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ ow .
But she ate it .
"( Laughter ) She should not go into b@@ an@@ king , for example , or work at a ca@@ sh re@@ gi@@ ster ."
But she will be success@@ ful .
And this app@@ lies for everything . E@@ ven in s@@ al@@ es .
"If the s@@ al@@ es person says , &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ it a second ."
I end with — the K@@ o@@ re@@ ans did this .
You know what ? This is so good that we want a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ all@@ ow book for children .
We did one for children . And now it is all over K@@ o@@ re@@ a .
They are teach@@ ing these kids ex@@ actly this pr@@ inci@@ ple .
"And we need to learn that pr@@ inci@@ ple here in the States , because we have a big de@@ b@@ t ."
We are e@@ ating more mar@@ sh@@ m@@ allo@@ ws than we are produc@@ ing .
Thank you so much .
"And I think , j@@ e@@ e@@ z , I &apos;m in the mi@@ ddle of a room of success@@ ful people !@@ "
I was@@ n &apos;t good enough ; I was@@ n &apos;t s@@ mar@@ t enough .
And there &apos;s no ma@@ gi@@ c to cre@@ ati@@ vity in coming up with ideas — it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .
"M@@ ight fa@@ il , k@@ id . D@@ on &apos;t make a lot of money at that , k@@ id ."
"M@@ arti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing did not say , &quot; I have a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are , &quot; when he in@@ sp@@ i@@ red the ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts move@@ ments ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I have a dre@@ am . &quot; &quot; And I have a dre@@ am ."
"I have a dre@@ am that we can stop thinking that the future will be a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are , and this is going to be a chall@@ en@@ ge , because , if you think of every ma@@ j@@ or b@@ loc@@ k@@ bu@@ st@@ ing fil@@ m of re@@ cent times , ne@@ arly all of its vi@@ sions for hum@@ an@@ ity are ap@@ o@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic ."
"I think this fil@@ m is one of the har@@ de@@ st wat@@ ch@@ es of modern times , &quot; &quot; The R@@ o@@ ad . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful piece of fil@@ m@@ making , but everything is de@@ sol@@ ate , everything is de@@ ad ."
"And just a father and son trying to survi@@ ve , wal@@ king along the ro@@ ad ."
And I think the environ@@ mental move@@ ment of which I am a part of has been comp@@ li@@ c@@ it in cre@@ ating this vi@@ sion of the future .
"For too long , we have pe@@ dd@@ led a ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ ish vi@@ sion of what &apos;s going to happen ."
We have fo@@ c@@ used on the wor@@ st@@ -@@ case sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
We have fo@@ c@@ used on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the solu@@ tions .
"We &apos;ve used fe@@ ar , if you like , to gra@@ b people &apos;s att@@ en@@ tion ."
And any psycho@@ logi@@ st will tell you that fe@@ ar in the organ@@ ism is l@@ in@@ ked to f@@ light me@@ chan@@ ism .
"It &apos;s part of the fi@@ ght and f@@ light me@@ chan@@ ism , that when an an@@ im@@ al is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — think of a de@@ er ."
"A de@@ er fre@@ e@@ z@@ es very , very still , po@@ ised to ru@@ n away ."
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re asking people to eng@@ age with our ag@@ end@@ a around environ@@ mental de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation and c@@ lim@@ ate change .
Pe@@ ople are fre@@ e@@ zing and run@@ ning away because we &apos;re using fe@@ ar .
And I think the environ@@ mental move@@ ment has to grow up and start to think about what progre@@ ss is .
What would it be like to be impro@@ ving the human lot ?
"And one of the problems that we face , I think , is that the only people that have cor@@ ner@@ ed the mark@@ et in terms of progre@@ ss is a fin@@ an@@ cial defin@@ ition of what progre@@ ss is , an economic defin@@ ition of what progre@@ ss is — that some@@ how , if we get the right numbers to go up , we &apos;re going to be better off , whether that &apos;s on the sto@@ ck mark@@ et , whether that &apos;s with G@@ D@@ P and economic growth , that some@@ how life is going to get better ."
This is some@@ how appe@@ al@@ ing to human gre@@ ed instead of fe@@ ar — that more is better .
"C@@ ome on . In the W@@ est@@ er@@ n world , we have enough ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe some parts of the world don &apos;t , but we have enough ."
And we &apos;ve know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the w@@ el@@ f@@ are of n@@ ations .
"In fact , the ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ t of our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system , S@@ im@@ on K@@ u@@ z@@ ne@@ ts , in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , said that , &quot; &quot; A n@@ ation &apos;s w@@ el@@ f@@ are can sc@@ ar@@ ce@@ ly be in@@ fer@@ red from their national income . &quot; &quot; But we &apos;ve cre@@ ated a national ac@@ coun@@ ting system which is fir@@ m@@ ly based on produc@@ tion and produc@@ ing stuff ."
"And in@@ de@@ ed , this is probably hi@@ st@@ ori@@ cal , and it had its time ."
"In the second World War , we needed to pro@@ duce a lot of stuff ."
"And in@@ de@@ ed , we were so success@@ ful at produc@@ ing certain t@@ yp@@ es of stuff that we de@@ stro@@ y@@ ed a lot of Eu@@ rop@@ e , and we had to re@@ build it af@@ ter@@ wards ."
And so our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system be@@ came fi@@ x@@ ated on what we can pro@@ duce .
"But as early as 19@@ 6@@ 8 , this vi@@ sion@@ ary man , R@@ ob@@ er@@ t K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy , at the start of his il@@ l@@ -@@ f@@ ated pre@@ si@@ d@@ enti@@ al ca@@ mp@@ a@@ i@@ gn , gave the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent de@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of gr@@ os@@ s national produc@@ t that ever has been ."
"And he fin@@ i@@ shed his talk with the ph@@ ra@@ se , that , &quot; &quot; The gr@@ os@@ s national produc@@ t meas@@ ures everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while . &quot; &quot; How c@@ ra@@ z@@ y is that ? That our measure of progre@@ ss , our dom@@ in@@ ant measure of progre@@ ss in society , is meas@@ uring everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while ?"
"I believe , if K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy was ali@@ ve today , he would be asking st@@ ati@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans such as my@@ self to go out and find out what makes life wor@@ th@@ while ."
"He &apos;d be asking us to re@@ desi@@ gn our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system to be based up@@ on such important things as social j@@ us@@ tice , su@@ sta@@ in@@ ab@@ i@@ lity and people &apos;s well-being ."
"And actually , social scienti@@ sts have already g@@ one out and asked these questions around the world ."
This is from a global sur@@ v@@ ey .
"It &apos;s asking people , what do they want ."
"And un@@ surpri@@ sing@@ ly , people all around the world say that what they want is happiness , for the@@ m@@ selves , for their fami@@ lies , their children , their comm@@ uni@@ ties ."
"O@@ kay , they think money is sli@@ gh@@ tly important ."
"It &apos;s there , but it &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as happiness , and it &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as love ."
We all need to love and be lo@@ ved in life .
It &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as health .
We want to be heal@@ thy and live a ful@@ l life .
These seem to be natural human as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions .
Why are st@@ ati@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans not meas@@ uring these ?
"Wh@@ y are we not thinking of the progre@@ ss of n@@ ations in these terms , instead of just how much stuff we have ?"
"And really , this is what I &apos;ve done with my ad@@ ult life — is think about how do we measure happiness , how do we measure well-being , how can we do that within environ@@ mental lim@@ its ."
"And we cre@@ ated , at the organiz@@ ation that I work for , the New E@@ con@@ om@@ ic@@ s F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation , something we call the H@@ app@@ y P@@ lan@@ et In@@ de@@ x , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy ."
Why don &apos;t we create a measure of progre@@ ss that sho@@ ws that ?
"And what we do , is we say that the ul@@ tim@@ ate out@@ come of a n@@ ation is how success@@ ful is it at cre@@ ating happy and heal@@ thy lives for its ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ."
That should be the go@@ al of every n@@ ation on the planet .
"But we have to remem@@ ber that there &apos;s a f@@ und@@ am@@ ental in@@ put to that , and that is how many of the planet &apos;s re@@ sour@@ ces we use ."
We all have one planet . We all have to share it .
"It is the ul@@ tim@@ ate sc@@ ar@@ ce re@@ sour@@ ce , the one planet that we share ."
And econom@@ ic@@ s is very interest@@ ed in sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ity .
"When it has a sc@@ ar@@ ce re@@ sour@@ ce that it wan@@ ts to turn into a desi@@ r@@ able out@@ come , it thin@@ ks in terms of e@@ ff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y ."
It thin@@ ks in terms of how much b@@ ang do we get for our b@@ uc@@ k .
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our plan@@ et@@ ary re@@ sour@@ ce use .
It is an e@@ ff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y measure .
"And probably the ea@@ si@@ est way to show you that , is to show you this grap@@ h ."
"@@ R@@ un@@ ning h@@ or@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ ally along the grap@@ h , is &quot; &quot; ec@@ o@@ logical fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ in@@ t , &quot; &quot; which is a measure of how much re@@ sour@@ ces we use and how much press@@ ure we put on the planet ."
M@@ ore is bad .
"@@ R@@ un@@ ning ver@@ tic@@ ally up@@ wards , is a measure called &quot; &quot; happy life years . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about the well-being of n@@ ations ."
It &apos;s like a happiness ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ed li@@ fe@@ -@@ expe@@ c@@ t@@ anc@@ y .
It &apos;s like qu@@ ality and quan@@ ti@@ ty of life in n@@ ations .
"And the y@@ ell@@ ow do@@ t there you see , is the global average ."
"Now , there &apos;s a hu@@ ge ar@@ r@@ ay of n@@ ations around that global average ."
"T@@ o the top right of the grap@@ h , are countries which are doing reas@@ on@@ ably well and produc@@ ing well-being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there ."
"They are the U.S@@ .@@ A@@ . , other W@@ est@@ er@@ n countries going across in those tri@@ ang@@ les and a few G@@ ul@@ f st@@ ates in there actually ."
"C@@ on@@ ver@@ se@@ ly , at the bot@@ tom left of the grap@@ h , are countries that are not produc@@ ing much well-being — t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally , sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an A@@ fri@@ c@@ a ."
"In H@@ ob@@ be@@ si@@ an terms , life is sh@@ ort and br@@ u@@ ti@@ sh there ."
The average life expe@@ c@@ t@@ anc@@ y in many of these countries is only 40 years .
"M@@ al@@ ari@@ a , H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S are k@@ il@@ ling a lot of people in these re@@ gi@@ ons of the world ."
But now for the good news !
"There are some countries up there , y@@ ell@@ ow tri@@ ang@@ les , that are doing better than global average , that are he@@ ad@@ ing up to@@ wards the top left of the grap@@ h ."
This is an as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tional grap@@ h .
"We want to be top left , where good lives don &apos;t cost the ear@@ th ."
They &apos;re L@@ ati@@ n American .
The country on its own up at the top is a place I ha@@ ven &apos;t been to .
Ma@@ ybe some of you have .
C@@ os@@ t@@ a R@@ ic@@ a .
C@@ os@@ t@@ a R@@ ic@@ a — average life expe@@ c@@ t@@ anc@@ y is 7@@ 8@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years .
That is longer than in the U@@ S@@ A .
"They are , acc@@ ord@@ ing to the l@@ at@@ est G@@ all@@ up world p@@ ol@@ l , the happ@@ i@@ est n@@ ation on the planet — than any@@ body ; more than S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land and D@@ en@@ mar@@ k ."
They are the happ@@ i@@ est place .
They are doing that on a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the re@@ sour@@ ces that are used t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally in &#91; the &#93; W@@ est@@ er@@ n world — a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the re@@ sour@@ ces .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in C@@ os@@ t@@ a R@@ ic@@ a ?
We can look at some of the data .
9@@ 9 percent of their electri@@ c@@ ity comes from r@@ ene@@ w@@ able re@@ sour@@ ces .
Th@@ e@@ ir govern@@ ment is one of the first to comm@@ it to be car@@ b@@ on ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al by 20@@ 2@@ 1 .
They ab@@ o@@ li@@ shed the ar@@ my in 19@@ 4@@ 9 — 19@@ 4@@ 9 .
And they in@@ ve@@ st@@ ed in social progra@@ ms — health and education .
They have one of the high@@ est liter@@ acy r@@ ates in L@@ ati@@ n America and in the world .
"And they have that L@@ ati@@ n vi@@ be , don &apos;t they ."
They have the social connec@@ te@@ d@@ ness .
"( Laughter ) The chall@@ en@@ ge is , that pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly — and the thing we might have to think about — is that the future might not be N@@ or@@ th American , might not be W@@ est@@ er@@ n Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an ."
It might be L@@ ati@@ n American .
"And the chall@@ en@@ ge , really , is to pul@@ l the global average up here ."
That &apos;s what we need to do .
"And if we &apos;re going to do that , we need to pul@@ l countries from the bot@@ tom , and we need to pul@@ l countries from the right of the grap@@ h ."
And then we &apos;re star@@ ting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
A@@ no@@ ther way of looking at it is looking at time tr@@ ends .
"We don &apos;t have good data going back for every country in the world , but for some of the ri@@ ch@@ est countries , the O@@ E@@ C@@ D group , we do ."
"And this is the tr@@ end in well-being over that time , a small increase , but this is the tr@@ end in ec@@ o@@ logical fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ in@@ t ."
"And so in stri@@ ct happ@@ y-@@ planet me@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ logy , we &apos;ve become less e@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent at tur@@ ning our ul@@ tim@@ ate sc@@ ar@@ ce re@@ sour@@ ce into the out@@ come we want to ."
"And the point really is , is that I think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 20@@ 50 without an ap@@ o@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic something happening ."
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human li@@ fe@@ time away .
A child en@@ ter@@ ing school today will be my age in 20@@ 50 .
This is not the very dist@@ ant future .
This is what the U.@@ K@@ . govern@@ ment t@@ ar@@ get on car@@ b@@ on and gre@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ se e@@ mis@@ sions looks like .
"And I put it to you , that is not b@@ usiness as u@@ su@@ al ."
That is chang@@ ing our b@@ usiness .
"That is chang@@ ing the way we create our organiz@@ ations , we do our govern@@ ment poli@@ c@@ y and we live our lives ."
"And the point is , we need to car@@ ry on increas@@ ing well-being ."
No one can go to the p@@ ol@@ ls and say that qu@@ ality of life is going to re@@ duce .
"@@ N@@ one of us , I think , want human progre@@ ss to stop ."
I think we want it to car@@ ry on .
I think we want the lot of hum@@ an@@ ity to keep on increas@@ ing .
And I think this is where c@@ lim@@ ate change s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics and d@@ en@@ i@@ ers come in .
I think this is what they want . They want qu@@ ality of life to keep increas@@ ing .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
"And if we &apos;re going to eng@@ age them , I think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do ."
And that means we have to really increase e@@ ff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y even more .
"Now that &apos;s all very easy to d@@ ra@@ w grap@@ h@@ s and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those cur@@ ves ."
"And this is where I think we can take a lea@@ f out of syste@@ ms theory , syste@@ ms engine@@ ers , where they create fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op@@ s , put the right information at the right point of time ."
"H@@ um@@ an be@@ ings are very mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated by the &quot; &quot; now . &quot; &quot; You put a s@@ mar@@ t me@@ ter in your home , and you see how much electri@@ c@@ ity you &apos;re using right now , how much it &apos;s cos@@ ting you , your kids go around and turn the li@@ ghts off pretty quic@@ kly ."
What would that look like for society ?
"Wh@@ y is it , on the radi@@ o news every even@@ ing , I hear the F@@ T@@ S@@ E 100 , the D@@ ow J@@ ones , the dol@@ lar p@@ ound ra@@ ti@@ o — I don &apos;t even know which way the dol@@ lar p@@ ound ra@@ ti@@ o should go to be good news ."
And why do I hear that ?
"Wh@@ y don &apos;t I hear how much energy B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in used ye@@ ster@@ day , or American used ye@@ ster@@ day ?"
D@@ id we me@@ et our three percent an@@ n@@ u@@ al t@@ ar@@ get on re@@ duc@@ ing car@@ b@@ on e@@ mis@@ sions ?
That &apos;s how you create a col@@ lec@@ tive go@@ al .
You put it out there into the medi@@ a and start thinking about it .
"And we need pos@@ itive fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op@@ s for increas@@ ing well-being A@@ t a govern@@ ment level , they might create national ac@@ coun@@ ts of well-being ."
"A@@ t a b@@ usiness level , you might look at the well-being of your emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , which we know is really l@@ in@@ ked to cre@@ ati@@ vity , which is l@@ in@@ ked to in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , and we &apos;re going to need a lot of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation to de@@ al with those environ@@ mental is@@ su@@ es ."
"A@@ t a per@@ s@@ onal level , we need these n@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ es too ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe we don &apos;t quite need the data , but we need re@@ min@@ d@@ ers ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , we have a strong publi@@ c health mes@@ sage on five f@@ ru@@ it and ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les a day and how much ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se we should do — never my best thing ."
What are these for happiness ?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happ@@ i@@ er ?
"We did a pro@@ ject for the G@@ o@@ vern@@ ment O@@ ff@@ ice of S@@ ci@@ ence a couple of years ago , a big progra@@ m called the F@@ o@@ re@@ sight progra@@ m — lots and lots of people — inv@@ olved lots of ex@@ per@@ ts — everything evi@@ dence based — a hu@@ ge t@@ ome ."
But a piece of work we did was on : what five pos@@ itive ac@@ tions can you do to impro@@ ve well-being in your life ?
"And the point of these is they are , not quite , the se@@ cre@@ ts of happiness , but they are things that I think happiness will f@@ low out the side from ."
"And the first of these is to con@@ ne@@ ct , is that your social relation@@ shi@@ ps are the most important cor@@ ner@@ st@@ ones of your life ."
"@@ Do you in@@ ve@@ st the time with your lo@@ ved ones that you could do , and energy ?"
K@@ e@@ ep buil@@ ding them .
The second one is be ac@@ tive .
"The fa@@ ste@@ st way out of a bad mo@@ od : ste@@ p outside , go for a wal@@ k , turn the radi@@ o on and d@@ ance ."
Be@@ ing ac@@ tive is great for our pos@@ itive mo@@ od .
The th@@ ir@@ d one is take no@@ tice .
"@@ How a@@ w@@ are are you of things going on around the world , the se@@ as@@ ons chang@@ ing , people around you ?"
Do you no@@ tice what &apos;s bub@@ bl@@ ing up for you and trying to e@@ mer@@ ge ?
"B@@ as@@ ed on a lot of evi@@ dence for min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ or@@ al ther@@ ap@@ y , &#91; very &#93; strong for our well being ."
The f@@ our@@ th is keep learning and keep is important — learning thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the whole life course .
"O@@ l@@ der people who keep learning and are cu@@ ri@@ ous , they have much better health out@@ comes than those who start to cl@@ ose down ."
But it doesn &apos;t have to be form@@ al learning ; it &apos;s not kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge based .
It &apos;s more cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
"It can be learning to c@@ ook a new dis@@ h , pic@@ king up an in@@ str@@ ument you for@@ got as a child ."
K@@ e@@ ep learning .
"And the fin@@ al one is that most an@@ ti@@ -@@ economic of acti@@ vi@@ ties , but give ."
"O@@ ur gener@@ os@@ ity , our al@@ tru@@ ism , our compassion , are all har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to the re@@ ward me@@ chan@@ ism in our brain ."
We feel good if we give .
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the mor@@ ning .
You tell one of them to sp@@ end it on the@@ m@@ selves and one on other people .
"You measure their happiness at the end of the day , those that have g@@ one and sp@@ ent on other people are much happ@@ i@@ er that those that sp@@ ent it on the@@ m@@ selves ."
"And these five ways , which we put on@@ to these h@@ an@@ dy pos@@ t@@ car@@ ds , I would say , don &apos;t have to cost the ear@@ th ."
They don &apos;t have any car@@ b@@ on cont@@ ent .
They don &apos;t need a lot of material go@@ o@@ ds to be sa@@ tis@@ fied .
And so I think it &apos;s really quite fe@@ a@@ sible that happiness does not cost the ear@@ th .
"Now , M@@ arti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , on the e@@ ve of his de@@ ath , gave an incredi@@ ble spe@@ ec@@ h ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I know there are chall@@ eng@@ es a@@ head , there may be tr@@ ou@@ ble a@@ head , but I fe@@ ar no one . I don &apos;t care ."
"I have been to the m@@ oun@@ tain top , and I have se@@ en the P@@ r@@ om@@ ised L@@ and . &quot; &quot; Now , he was a pre@@ acher , but I believe the environ@@ mental move@@ ment and , in fact , the b@@ usiness comm@@ unity , govern@@ ment , ne@@ e@@ ds to go to the top of the m@@ oun@@ tain top , and it ne@@ e@@ ds to look out , and it ne@@ e@@ ds to see the P@@ r@@ om@@ ised L@@ and , or the land of pr@@ om@@ ise , and it ne@@ e@@ ds to have a vi@@ sion of a world that we all want ."
"And not only that , we need to create a G@@ re@@ at T@@ ran@@ si@@ tion to get there , and we need to pa@@ ve that great tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion with good things ."
H@@ um@@ an be@@ ings want to be happy .
P@@ a@@ ve them with the five ways .
And we need to have sign@@ pos@@ ts ga@@ ther@@ ing people together and poin@@ ting them — something like the H@@ app@@ y P@@ lan@@ et In@@ de@@ x .
"And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want , where happiness does not cost the ear@@ th ."

A few months ago the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze in physics was a@@ war@@ ded to two te@@ a@@ ms of a@@ stron@@ om@@ ers for a disco@@ very that has been ha@@ il@@ ed as one of the most important a@@ stron@@ om@@ i@@ cal observ@@ ations ever .
"And today , after bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly describ@@ ing what they found , I &apos;m going to tell you about a high@@ ly contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al f@@ ra@@ me@@ work for expla@@ ining their disco@@ very , na@@ me@@ ly the pos@@ sibi@@ lity that way be@@ y@@ on@@ d the Earth , the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay and other dist@@ ant galaxies , we may find that our universe is not the only universe , but is instead part of a va@@ st comple@@ x of universes that we call the multi@@ verse ."
Now the idea of a multi@@ verse is a stran@@ ge one .
"I mean , most of us were ra@@ ised to believe that the word &quot; &quot; universe &quot; &quot; means everything ."
"And I say most of us with fore@@ thought , as my f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old daughter has heard me spea@@ k of these ideas since she was born ."
"And last year I was h@@ ol@@ ding her and I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ op@@ hi@@ a , I love you more than anything in the universe . &quot; &quot; And she turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , universe or multi@@ verse ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But b@@ ar@@ r@@ ing such an an@@ om@@ al@@ ous up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing , it is stran@@ ge to imagine other re@@ al@@ ms se@@ par@@ ate from ours , most with f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ ally different fe@@ atures , that would ri@@ gh@@ tly be called universes of their own ."
"And yet , spec@@ ula@@ tive though the idea su@@ re@@ ly is , I a@@ i@@ m to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you that there &apos;s reason for ta@@ king it ser@@ i@@ ously , as it just might be right ."
I &apos;m going to tell the story of the multi@@ verse in three parts .
"In part one , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be those No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ z@@ e-@@ w@@ inning results and to high@@ light a pro@@ found my@@ st@@ ery which those results re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed ."
"In part two , I &apos;ll off@@ er a s@@ olution to that my@@ st@@ ery ."
"It &apos;s based on an appro@@ ach called string theory , and that &apos;s where the idea of the multi@@ verse will come into the story ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , in part three , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be a cos@@ mo@@ logical theory called in@@ f@@ la@@ tion , which will pul@@ l all the pi@@ ec@@ es of the story together ."
"O@@ kay , part one star@@ ts back in 19@@ 2@@ 9 when the great a@@ stron@@ om@@ er E@@ d@@ w@@ in H@@ u@@ b@@ ble re@@ alized that the dist@@ ant galaxies were all ru@@ shing away from us , est@@ ab@@ li@@ shing that space itself is stre@@ t@@ ching , it &apos;s exp@@ anding ."
Now this was re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary .
The pre@@ va@@ il@@ ing w@@ is@@ dom was that on the lar@@ gest of sc@@ al@@ es the universe was st@@ ati@@ c .
"But even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : The exp@@ an@@ sion must be s@@ lo@@ wing down ."
"That , much as the gra@@ vit@@ ati@@ onal pul@@ l of the Earth s@@ lo@@ ws the as@@ cent of an app@@ le t@@ os@@ sed up@@ ward , the gra@@ vit@@ ati@@ onal pul@@ l of each galax@@ y on every other must be s@@ lo@@ wing the exp@@ an@@ sion of space ."
Now let &apos;s fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ ward to the 19@@ 9@@ 0s when those two te@@ a@@ ms of a@@ stron@@ om@@ ers I m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed at the out@@ set were in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by this reas@@ on@@ ing to measure the r@@ ate at which the exp@@ an@@ sion has been s@@ lo@@ wing .
"And they did this by pain@@ sta@@ king observ@@ ations of num@@ er@@ ous dist@@ ant galaxies , allo@@ wing them to char@@ t how the exp@@ an@@ sion r@@ ate has chang@@ ed over time ."
Here &apos;s the surpri@@ se : They found that the exp@@ an@@ sion is not s@@ lo@@ wing down .
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad they found that it &apos;s spe@@ ed@@ ing up , going fa@@ ster and fa@@ ster ."
That &apos;s like t@@ os@@ sing an app@@ le up@@ ward and it goes up fa@@ ster and fa@@ ster .
"Now if you saw an app@@ le do that , you &apos;d want to know why ."
What &apos;s pu@@ shing on it ?
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , the a@@ stron@@ om@@ ers &apos; results are su@@ re@@ ly well-@@ de@@ ser@@ ving of the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze , but they ra@@ ised an an@@ al@@ o@@ g@@ ous question ."
What force is dri@@ ving all galaxies to r@@ us@@ h away from every other at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ quic@@ k@@ en@@ ing spe@@ ed ?
Well the most pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing answer comes from an old idea of E@@ instein &apos;s .
"You see , we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing , pul@@ ls ob@@ jec@@ ts together ."
"But in E@@ instein &apos;s theory of gravity , his gener@@ al theory of rela@@ ti@@ vity , gravity can also p@@ us@@ h things ap@@ ar@@ t ."
"@@ How ? Well acc@@ ord@@ ing to E@@ instein &apos;s mat@@ h , if space is uni@@ form@@ ly fil@@ led with an in@@ vi@@ sible energy , sort of like a uni@@ form , in@@ vi@@ sible mi@@ st , then the gravity gener@@ ated by that mi@@ st would be rep@@ ul@@ sive , rep@@ ul@@ sive gravity , which is just what we need to explain the observ@@ ations ."
"Because the rep@@ ul@@ sive gravity of an in@@ vi@@ sible energy in space — we now call it dark energy , but I &apos;ve made it s@@ mo@@ k@@ ey wh@@ ite here so you can see it — its rep@@ ul@@ sive gravity would cause each galax@@ y to p@@ us@@ h against every other , dri@@ ving exp@@ an@@ sion to spe@@ ed up , not s@@ low down ."
And this ex@@ plan@@ ation re@@ pres@@ ents great progre@@ ss .
But I pr@@ om@@ ised you a my@@ st@@ ery here in part one .
Here it is .
"When the a@@ stron@@ om@@ ers worked out how much of this dark energy must be in@@ f@@ using space to ac@@ coun@@ t for the cos@@ mic spe@@ ed up , look at what they found ."
This number is small .
"E@@ x@@ press@@ ed in the rele@@ v@@ ant un@@ it , it is spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ arly small ."
And the my@@ st@@ ery is to explain this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar number .
"We want this number to e@@ mer@@ ge from the la@@ ws of physics , but so far no one has found a way to do that ."
"Now you might won@@ der , should you care ?"
"M@@ a@@ ybe expla@@ ining this number is just a tech@@ ni@@ cal is@@ sue , a tech@@ ni@@ cal deta@@ il of inter@@ est to ex@@ per@@ ts , but of no rele@@ v@@ ance to any@@ body else ."
"Well it su@@ re@@ ly is a tech@@ ni@@ cal deta@@ il , but some deta@@ il@@ s really matter ."
"S@@ ome deta@@ il@@ s pro@@ vi@@ de w@@ in@@ do@@ ws into un@@ char@@ ted re@@ al@@ ms of reality , and this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar number may be doing just that , as the only appro@@ ach that &apos;s so far made he@@ ad@@ way to explain it inv@@ o@@ kes the pos@@ sibi@@ lity of other universes — an idea that natur@@ ally e@@ mer@@ g@@ es from string theory , which ta@@ kes me to part two : string theory ."
So hold the my@@ st@@ ery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three k@@ ey things about string theory .
"F@@ irst off , what is it ?"
"Well it &apos;s an appro@@ ach to re@@ aliz@@ e E@@ instein &apos;s dre@@ am of a uni@@ fied theory of physics , a single o@@ ver@@ ar@@ ching f@@ ra@@ me@@ work that would be able to descri@@ be all the for@@ ces at work in the universe ."
And the cen@@ tr@@ al idea of string theory is quite stra@@ i@@ ght@@ for@@ ward .
"It says that if you ex@@ am@@ ine any piece of matter ever more fin@@ ely , at first you &apos;ll find mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es and then you &apos;ll find at@@ oms and sub@@ at@@ om@@ ic particles ."
"But the theory says that if you could pro@@ be sm@@ all@@ er , much sm@@ all@@ er than we can with exist@@ ing technology , you &apos;d find something else inside these particles — a little tiny vibr@@ ating fil@@ a@@ ment of energy , a little tiny vibr@@ ating string ."
"And just like the str@@ ings on a viol@@ in , they can vibr@@ ate in different patter@@ ns produc@@ ing different mu@@ sical n@@ ot@@ es ."
"Th@@ ese little f@@ und@@ am@@ ental str@@ ings , when they vibr@@ ate in different patter@@ ns , they pro@@ duce different kinds of particles — so electr@@ ons , qu@@ ar@@ ks , ne@@ u@@ tr@@ in@@ os , ph@@ ot@@ ons , all other particles would be un@@ ited into a single f@@ ra@@ me@@ work , as they would all ari@@ se from vibr@@ ating str@@ ings ."
"It &apos;s a comp@@ elling picture , a kind of cos@@ mic sy@@ mp@@ hon@@ y , where all the ri@@ ch@@ ness that we see in the world around us e@@ mer@@ g@@ es from the music that these little , tiny str@@ ings can pl@@ ay ."
"But there &apos;s a cost to this el@@ e@@ g@@ ant uni@@ fi@@ cation , because years of resear@@ ch have sho@@ wn that the mat@@ h of string theory doesn &apos;t quite work ."
"It has inter@@ n@@ al in@@ con@@ sist@@ en@@ ci@@ es , un@@ less we all@@ ow for something wh@@ ol@@ ly un@@ fami@@ li@@ ar — extra dimensions of space ."
"That is , we all know about the u@@ su@@ al three dimensions of space ."
"And you can think about those as he@@ ight , wi@@ d@@ th and dep@@ th ."
"But string theory says that , on f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic@@ ally small sc@@ al@@ es , there are ad@@ di@@ tional dimensions c@@ ru@@ mp@@ led to a tiny si@@ ze so small that we have not de@@ te@@ c@@ ted them ."
"But even though the dimensions are hi@@ dd@@ en , they would have an imp@@ act on things that we can ob@@ ser@@ ve because the shape of the extra dimensions con@@ stra@@ ins how the str@@ ings can vibr@@ ate ."
"And in string theory , vi@@ bra@@ tion de@@ ter@@ min@@ es everything ."
"So partic@@ le ma@@ ss@@ es , the str@@ eng@@ ths of for@@ ces , and most import@@ an@@ tly , the amount of dark energy would be de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed by the shape of the extra dimensions ."
"So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions , we should be able to cal@@ cul@@ ate these fe@@ atures , cal@@ cul@@ ate the amount of dark energy ."
The chall@@ en@@ ge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
A@@ ll we have is a li@@ st of can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es allowed by the mat@@ h .
"Now when these ideas were first developed , there were only about five different can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es , so you can imagine an@@ al@@ y@@ zing them on@@ e-@@ b@@ y-@@ one to de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine if any y@@ i@@ el@@ d the phy@@ sical fe@@ atures we ob@@ ser@@ ve ."
But over time the li@@ st gre@@ w as resear@@ ch@@ ers found other can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es .
"F@@ rom five , the number gre@@ w into the hund@@ re@@ ds and then the thousands — A lar@@ ge , but still man@@ a@@ ge@@ able , col@@ lec@@ tion to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze , since after all , gra@@ du@@ ate students need something to do ."
"But then the li@@ st continu@@ ed to grow into the m@@ illions and the b@@ illions , until today ."
The li@@ st of can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es has so@@ ar@@ ed to about 10 to the 5@@ 00 .
"So , what to do ?"
"Well some resear@@ ch@@ ers l@@ ost heart , con@@ clu@@ ding that was so many can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es for the extra dimensions , each giving ri@@ se to different phy@@ sical fe@@ atures , string theory would never make defin@@ itive , test@@ able pre@@ dic@@ tions ."
"But others turned this is@@ sue on its head , ta@@ king us to the pos@@ sibi@@ lity of a multi@@ verse ."
Here &apos;s the idea .
Ma@@ ybe each of these shap@@ es is on an equ@@ al fo@@ ot@@ ing with every other .
"E@@ ach is as real as every other , in the sense that there are many universes , each with a different shape , for the extra dimensions ."
And this radi@@ cal pro@@ pos@@ al has a pro@@ found imp@@ act on this my@@ st@@ ery : the amount of dark energy re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed by the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ z@@ e-@@ w@@ inning results .
"Because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the phy@@ sical fe@@ atures of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different ."
Wh@@ ich means that the my@@ st@@ ery of expla@@ ining the amount of dark energy we &apos;ve now meas@@ u@@ red would take on a wh@@ ol@@ ly different char@@ ac@@ ter .
"In this cont@@ ex@@ t , the la@@ ws of physics can &apos;t explain one number for the dark energy because there isn &apos;t just one number , there are many numbers ."
Wh@@ ich means we have been asking the wrong question .
"It &apos;s that the right question to ask is , why do we hum@@ ans find our@@ selves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve meas@@ u@@ red instead of any of the other pos@@ sibi@@ li@@ ties that are out there ?"
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make he@@ ad@@ way .
"Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours , wh@@ en@@ ever matter tries to cl@@ um@@ p into galaxies , the rep@@ ul@@ sive p@@ us@@ h of the dark energy is so strong that it b@@ lo@@ ws the cl@@ um@@ p ap@@ ar@@ t and galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they col@@ l@@ ap@@ se back on the@@ m@@ selves so quic@@ kly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And without galaxies , there are no stars , no planets and no chan@@ ce for our form of life to ex@@ ist in those other universes ."
So we find our@@ selves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve meas@@ u@@ red simply because our universe has con@@ di@@ tions h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ able to our form of life .
And that would be that .
"M@@ y@@ st@@ ery sol@@ ved , multi@@ verse found ."
Now some find this ex@@ plan@@ ation un@@ sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying .
We &apos;re used to physics giving us defin@@ itive ex@@ plan@@ ations for the fe@@ atures we ob@@ ser@@ ve .
"But the point is , if the fe@@ ature you &apos;re ob@@ ser@@ ving can and does take on a wi@@ de v@@ ari@@ e@@ ty of different valu@@ es across the wi@@ der l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of reality , then thinking one ex@@ plan@@ ation for a particular valu@@ e is simply mis@@ gu@@ i@@ ded ."
A@@ n early example comes from the great a@@ stron@@ om@@ er Jo@@ h@@ an@@ n@@ es K@@ e@@ pl@@ er who was ob@@ se@@ ss@@ ed with underst@@ anding a different number — why the Sun is 9@@ 3 million mil@@ es away from the Earth .
"And he worked for de@@ ca@@ des trying to explain this number , but he never su@@ c@@ ce@@ eded , and we know why ."
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er was asking the wrong question .
We now know that there are many planets at a wi@@ de v@@ ari@@ e@@ ty of different dist@@ anc@@ es from their h@@ ost stars .
"So hop@@ ing that the la@@ ws of physics will explain one particular number , 9@@ 3 million mil@@ es , well that is simply wr@@ on@@ gh@@ e@@ ad@@ ed ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad the right question to ask is , why do we hum@@ ans find our@@ selves on a planet at this particular dist@@ ance , instead of any of the other pos@@ sibi@@ li@@ ties ?"
"And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer ."
Th@@ ose planets which are much cl@@ os@@ er to a star like the Sun would be so h@@ o@@ t that our form of life wouldn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
"And those planets that are much far@@ ther away from the star , well they &apos;re so co@@ ld that , again , our form of life would not take hold ."
So we find our@@ selves on a planet at this particular dist@@ ance simply because it y@@ i@@ el@@ ds con@@ di@@ tions vit@@ al to our form of life .
"And when it comes to planets and their dist@@ anc@@ es , this c@@ lear@@ ly is the right kind of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"The point is , when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they con@@ tain , it may also be the right kind of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"One k@@ ey difference , of course , is we know that there are other planets out there , but so far I &apos;ve only spe@@ cul@@ ated on the pos@@ sibi@@ lity that there might be other universes ."
"So to pul@@ l it all together , we need a me@@ chan@@ ism that can actually gener@@ ate other universes ."
"And that ta@@ kes me to my fin@@ al part , part three ."
Because such a me@@ chan@@ ism has been found by cos@@ mo@@ logi@@ sts trying to understand the Big Bang .
"You see , when we spea@@ k of the Big Bang , we o@@ f@@ ten have an i@@ ma@@ ge of a kind of cos@@ mic expl@@ os@@ i@@ on that cre@@ ated our universe and set space ru@@ shing ou@@ tw@@ ard ."
But there &apos;s a little se@@ cre@@ t .
"The Big Bang lea@@ ves out something pretty important , the Bang ."
"It t@@ ells us how the universe ev@@ olved after the Bang , but gi@@ ves us no in@@ sight into what would have po@@ wer@@ ed the Bang itself ."
And this ga@@ p was fin@@ ally fil@@ led by an en@@ h@@ anc@@ ed ver@@ sion of the Big Bang theory .
"It &apos;s called in@@ f@@ la@@ tion@@ ary cos@@ mo@@ logy , which i@@ d@@ enti@@ fied a particular kind of fu@@ el that would natur@@ ally gener@@ ate an ou@@ tw@@ ard r@@ us@@ h of space ."
"The fu@@ el is based on something called a quantum field , but the only deta@@ il that mat@@ ters for us is that this fu@@ el pro@@ ves to be so e@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent that it &apos;s vir@@ tually imp@@ os@@ sible to use it all up , which means in the in@@ f@@ la@@ tion@@ ary theory , the Big Bang giving ri@@ se to our universe is li@@ ke@@ ly not a on@@ e-@@ time ev@@ ent ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad the fu@@ el not only gener@@ ated our Big Bang , but it would also gener@@ ate coun@@ t@@ less other Big B@@ an@@ gs , each giving ri@@ se to its own se@@ par@@ ate universe with our universe be@@ coming but one bub@@ ble in a gr@@ and cos@@ mic bub@@ ble b@@ ath of universes ."
"And now , when we m@@ el@@ d this with string theory , here &apos;s the picture we &apos;re led to ."
E@@ ach of these universes has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a wi@@ de v@@ ari@@ e@@ ty of different shap@@ es .
The different shap@@ es y@@ i@@ el@@ d different phy@@ sical fe@@ atures .
"And we find our@@ selves in one universe instead of another simply because it &apos;s only in our universe that the phy@@ sical fe@@ atures , like the amount of dark energy , are right for our form of life to take hold ."
And this is the comp@@ elling but high@@ ly contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al picture of the wi@@ der cos@@ mo@@ s that cu@@ tt@@ ing@@ -@@ ed@@ ge observ@@ ation and theory have now led us to ser@@ i@@ ously con@@ si@@ der .
"One big re@@ ma@@ ining question , of course , is , could we ever con@@ fir@@ m the exist@@ ence of other universes ?"
Well let me descri@@ be one way that might one day happen .
The in@@ f@@ la@@ tion@@ ary theory already has strong observ@@ ati@@ onal supp@@ ort .
"Because the theory pre@@ dic@@ ts that the Big Bang would have been so int@@ en@@ se that as space r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly exp@@ and@@ ed , tiny quantum j@@ it@@ ters from the mic@@ r@@ o world would have been stre@@ t@@ ched out to the m@@ ac@@ r@@ o world , y@@ i@@ el@@ ding a dist@@ in@@ c@@ tive fin@@ g@@ er@@ pr@@ in@@ t , a patter@@ n of sli@@ gh@@ tly h@@ ot@@ ter sp@@ ots and sli@@ gh@@ tly col@@ der sp@@ ots , across space , which po@@ wer@@ ful t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ es have now ob@@ ser@@ ved ."
"@@ G@@ o@@ ing f@@ ur@@ ther , if there are other universes , the theory pre@@ dic@@ ts that every so o@@ f@@ ten those universes can col@@ li@@ de ."
"And if our universe got h@@ it by another , that col@@ li@@ sion would gener@@ ate an ad@@ di@@ tional sub@@ t@@ le patter@@ n of te@@ m@@ per@@ ature v@@ ari@@ ations across space that we might one day be able to de@@ te@@ ct ."
"And so ex@@ o@@ tic as this picture is , it may one day be gr@@ oun@@ ded in observ@@ ations , est@@ ab@@ li@@ shing the exist@@ ence of other universes ."
I &apos;ll con@@ clu@@ de with a stri@@ king imp@@ li@@ cation of all these ideas for the very far future .
"You see , we learned that our universe is not st@@ ati@@ c , that space is exp@@ anding , that that exp@@ an@@ sion is spe@@ ed@@ ing up and that there might be other universes all by car@@ e@@ fully ex@@ am@@ ining fa@@ in@@ t p@@ in@@ poin@@ ts of star@@ light coming to us from dist@@ ant galaxies ."
"But because the exp@@ an@@ sion is spe@@ ed@@ ing up , in the very far future , those galaxies will r@@ us@@ h away so far and so fa@@ st that we won &apos;t be able to see them — not because of techno@@ logical lim@@ it@@ ations , but because of the la@@ ws of physics ."
"The light those galaxies em@@ it , even tra@@ vel@@ ing at the fa@@ ste@@ st spe@@ ed , the spe@@ ed of light , will not be able to o@@ ver@@ come the e@@ ver@@ -@@ wi@@ d@@ en@@ ing g@@ ul@@ f between us ."
"So a@@ stron@@ om@@ ers in the far future looking out into de@@ ep space will see nothing but an end@@ less stre@@ t@@ ch of st@@ ati@@ c , in@@ k@@ y , black sti@@ l@@ l@@ ness ."
And they will con@@ clu@@ de that the universe is st@@ ati@@ c and un@@ chang@@ ing and pop@@ ul@@ ated by a single cen@@ tr@@ al o@@ as@@ is of matter that they in@@ ha@@ bit — a picture of the cos@@ mo@@ s that we defin@@ i@@ tively know to be wrong .
"Now maybe those future a@@ stron@@ om@@ ers will have rec@@ or@@ ds h@@ and@@ ed down from an ear@@ li@@ er er@@ a , like ours , at@@ test@@ ing to an exp@@ anding cos@@ mo@@ s te@@ em@@ ing with galaxies ."
But would those future a@@ stron@@ om@@ ers believe such an@@ ci@@ ent kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge ?
"O@@ r would they believe in the black , st@@ ati@@ c emp@@ ty universe that their own st@@ at@@ e-@@ o@@ f-@@ the@@ -@@ ar@@ t observ@@ ations re@@ ve@@ al ?"
I su@@ spe@@ ct the l@@ at@@ ter .

B@@ G : Well it &apos;s hard to say .
"When we learn that a@@ stron@@ om@@ ers of the far future may not have enough information to fig@@ ure things out , the natural question is , maybe we &apos;re already in that position and certain de@@ ep , cri@@ tical fe@@ atures of the universe already have es@@ cap@@ ed our ab@@ i@@ lity to understand because of how cos@@ mo@@ logy ev@@ ol@@ ves ."
"So from that per@@ spec@@ tive , maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is ."
"We can understand how to understand the data from the mic@@ ro@@ wa@@ ve bac@@ k@@ ground radi@@ ation that was set down 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 7@@ 2 billion years ago — and yet , we can do cal@@ c@@ ula@@ tions today to pre@@ di@@ ct how it will look and it mat@@ ch@@ es ."

"In the year 19@@ 1@@ 9 , a vir@@ tually un@@ known G@@ er@@ man ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ ci@@ an , n@@ am@@ ed Th@@ e@@ o@@ d@@ or K@@ alu@@ z@@ a sug@@ ge@@ st@@ ed a very bo@@ ld and , in some ways , a very bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re idea ."
"That is in ad@@ dition to left , right , back , for@@ th and up , down , K@@ alu@@ z@@ a pro@@ pos@@ ed that there might be ad@@ di@@ tional dimensions of space that for some reason we don &apos;t yet see ."
"Now , when someone makes a bo@@ ld and bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re idea , some@@ times that &apos;s all it is — bo@@ ld and bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , but it has nothing to do with the world around us ."
"This particular idea , h@@ ow@@ ever — al@@ though we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s right or wrong , and at the end I &apos;ll di@@ sc@@ us@@ s experi@@ ments which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it &apos;s right or wrong — this idea has had a ma@@ j@@ or imp@@ act on physics in the last century and continu@@ es to in@@ form a lot of cu@@ tt@@ ing@@ -@@ ed@@ ge resear@@ ch ."
"So , I &apos;d like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions ."
So where do we go ?
"This is a year when E@@ instein is bas@@ king in the g@@ low of having disco@@ ver@@ ed the spe@@ cial theory of rela@@ ti@@ vity and deci@@ des to take on a new pro@@ ject , to try to understand fully the gr@@ and , per@@ va@@ sive force of gravity ."
"And in that moment , there are many people around who thought that that pro@@ ject had already been re@@ sol@@ ved ."
"@@ Ne@@ w@@ ton had gi@@ ven the world a theory of gravity in the l@@ ate 1@@ 6@@ 00@@ s that works well , describ@@ es the mo@@ tion of planets , the mo@@ tion of the moon and so for@@ th , the mo@@ tion of ap@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ yp@@ ha@@ l of app@@ les f@@ all@@ ing from tre@@ es , h@@ it@@ ting people on the head ."
A@@ ll of that could be describ@@ ed using Ne@@ w@@ ton &apos;s work .
"But E@@ instein re@@ alized that Ne@@ w@@ ton had left something out of the story , because even Ne@@ w@@ ton had wr@@ it@@ ten that al@@ though he underst@@ ood how to cal@@ cul@@ ate the effec@@ t of gravity , he &apos;d been un@@ able to fig@@ ure out how it really works ."
"@@ How is it that the Sun , 9@@ 3 million mil@@ es away , &#91; that &#93; some@@ how it a@@ ffec@@ ts the mo@@ tion of the Earth ?"
How does the Sun re@@ ach out across emp@@ ty in@@ er@@ t space and ex@@ er@@ t in@@ flu@@ ence ?
And that is a t@@ ask to which E@@ instein set hi@@ m@@ self — to fig@@ ure out how gravity works .
And let me show you what it is that he found .
So E@@ instein found that the medi@@ um that trans@@ m@@ its gravity is space itself .
The idea goes like this : imagine space is a sub@@ str@@ ate of all there is .
"E@@ instein said space is n@@ ice and fl@@ at , if there &apos;s no matter pres@@ ent ."
"But if there is matter in the environ@@ ment , such as the Sun , it ca@@ us@@ es the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space to war@@ p , to cur@@ ve ."
And that comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ tes the force of gravity .
E@@ ven the Earth war@@ ps space around it .
Now look at the M@@ o@@ on .
"The M@@ o@@ on is ke@@ p@@ t in or@@ bit , acc@@ ord@@ ing to these ideas , because it ro@@ l@@ ls along a v@@ al@@ ley in the cur@@ ved environ@@ ment that the Sun and the M@@ o@@ on and the Earth can all create by vir@@ tu@@ e of their pres@@ ence ."
We go to a ful@@ l@@ -@@ f@@ ra@@ me view of this .
The Earth itself is ke@@ p@@ t in or@@ bit because it ro@@ l@@ ls along a v@@ al@@ ley in the environ@@ ment that &apos;s cur@@ ved because of the Sun &apos;s pres@@ ence .
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works .
"Now , this idea was test@@ ed in 19@@ 1@@ 9 through a@@ stron@@ om@@ i@@ cal observ@@ ations ."
It really works . It describ@@ es the data .
And this ga@@ ined E@@ instein pr@@ om@@ in@@ ence around the world .
And that is what got K@@ alu@@ z@@ a thinking .
"He , like E@@ instein , was in sear@@ ch of what we call a uni@@ fied theory ."
"That &apos;s one theory that might be able to descri@@ be all of nature &apos;s for@@ ces from one set of ideas , one set of pr@@ inci@@ pl@@ es , one ma@@ ster equ@@ ation , if you will ."
"So K@@ alu@@ z@@ a said to hi@@ m@@ self , E@@ instein has been able to descri@@ be gravity in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in space — in fact , space and time , to be more preci@@ se ."
"You know , the force respon@@ sible for electri@@ c@@ ity and magnetic at@@ tr@@ action and so for@@ th ."
"So K@@ alu@@ z@@ a says , maybe I can pl@@ ay the same ga@@ me and descri@@ be electr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic force in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves ."
That ra@@ ised a question : war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in what ?
"E@@ instein had already used up space and time , war@@ ps and cur@@ ves , to descri@@ be gravity ."
There didn &apos;t seem to be anything else to war@@ p or cur@@ ve .
"So K@@ alu@@ z@@ a said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space ."
"He said , if I want to descri@@ be one more force , maybe I need one more dimen@@ sion ."
"And when he looked at that equ@@ ation , it was n@@ one other than the equ@@ ation that scienti@@ sts had long known to descri@@ be the electr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic force ."
A@@ ma@@ zing — it just pop@@ p@@ ed out .
"He was so exc@@ ited by this re@@ alization that he r@@ an around his h@@ ou@@ se s@@ cre@@ am@@ ing , &quot; &quot; V@@ ic@@ t@@ ory ! &quot; &quot; — that he had found the uni@@ fied theory ."
"Now c@@ lear@@ ly , K@@ alu@@ z@@ a was a man who took theory very ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"He , in fact — there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to s@@ wi@@ m , he read a book , a tre@@ ati@@ se on s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing — ( Laughter ) — then do@@ ve into the o@@ ce@@ an ."
This is a man who would ri@@ s@@ k his life on theory .
"Now , but for those of us who are a little bit more pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ally min@@ ded , two questions im@@ medi@@ ately ari@@ se from his observ@@ ation ."
"@@ N@@ um@@ ber one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ?"
We don &apos;t seem to see them .
"And number two : does this theory really work in deta@@ il , when you try to app@@ ly it to the world around us ?"
"Now , the first question was ans@@ wer@@ ed in 19@@ 2@@ 6 by a f@@ ell@@ ow n@@ am@@ ed O@@ sk@@ ar K@@ le@@ in ."
"So , imagine you &apos;re looking at something like a ca@@ ble supp@@ or@@ ting a tra@@ ff@@ ic light ."
"It &apos;s in M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an . You &apos;re in C@@ en@@ tr@@ al P@@ ark — it &apos;s kind of ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant — but the ca@@ ble looks on@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal from a dist@@ ant vie@@ w@@ point , but you and I all know that it does have some th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness ."
"It &apos;s very hard to see it , though , from far away ."
"But if we z@@ oo@@ m in and take the per@@ spec@@ tive of , say , a little ant wal@@ king around — little an@@ ts are so small that they can acc@@ ess all of the dimensions — the long dimen@@ sion , but also this c@@ loc@@ k@@ wi@@ se , coun@@ ter@@ -@@ c@@ loc@@ k@@ wi@@ se direc@@ tion ."
And I hop@@ e you app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate this .
It took so long to get these an@@ ts to do this .
"( Laughter ) But this il@@ lu@@ str@@ ates the fact that dimensions can be of two s@@ orts : big and small . And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can ea@@ si@@ ly see , but there might be ad@@ di@@ tional dimensions cur@@ led up , sort of like the circ@@ ular part of that ca@@ ble , so small that they have so far re@@ ma@@ ined in@@ vi@@ sible ."
Let me show you what that would look like .
"S@@ ome of you gu@@ ys will fi@@ x that one day , but anything that &apos;s not fl@@ at on a s@@ cre@@ en is a new dimen@@ sion , goes sm@@ all@@ er , sm@@ all@@ er , sm@@ all@@ er , and way down in the mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic dep@@ ths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have ad@@ di@@ tional cur@@ led up dimensions — here is a little shape of a circ@@ le — so small that we don &apos;t see them ."
"But if you were a little ul@@ tra mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic ant wal@@ king around , you could wal@@ k in the big dimensions that we all know about — that &apos;s like the g@@ ri@@ d part — but you could also acc@@ ess the tiny cur@@ le@@ d@@ -@@ up dimen@@ sion that &apos;s so small that we can &apos;t see it with the na@@ ked ey@@ e or even with any of our most re@@ fin@@ ed equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment ."
"But de@@ e@@ p@@ ly t@@ uc@@ ked into the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimensions , as we see there ."
But what about the second question that I asked : does the theory actually work when you try to app@@ ly it to the real world ?
"Well , it turns out that E@@ instein and K@@ alu@@ z@@ a and many others worked on trying to re@@ f@@ ine this f@@ ra@@ me@@ work and app@@ ly it to the physics of the universe as was underst@@ ood at the time , and , in deta@@ il , it didn &apos;t work ."
"In deta@@ il , for inst@@ ance , they cou@@ ldn &apos;t get the ma@@ ss of the electr@@ on to work out cor@@ rec@@ tly in this theory ."
"So many people worked on it , but by the &apos; 4@@ 0s , cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly by the &apos; 5@@ 0s , this stran@@ ge but very comp@@ elling idea of how to uni@@ f@@ y the la@@ ws of physics had g@@ one away ."
Un@@ til something wonderful happened in our age .
"In our er@@ a , a new appro@@ ach to uni@@ f@@ y the la@@ ws of physics is being pur@@ su@@ ed by phy@@ si@@ ci@@ sts such as my@@ self , many others around the world , it &apos;s called super@@ string theory , as you were in@@ di@@ ca@@ ting ."
"And the wonderful thing is that super@@ string theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study super@@ string theory , we find that it re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ts the idea in a s@@ par@@ k@@ ling , new form ."
"So , let me just tell you how that goes ."
Su@@ per@@ string theory — what is it ?
"Well , it &apos;s a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the ba@@ sic , f@@ und@@ am@@ ental , in@@ divi@@ sible , un@@ cu@@ tt@@ able con@@ sti@@ tu@@ ents making up everything in the world around us ?"
The idea is like this .
"So , imagine we look at a fami@@ li@@ ar ob@@ ject , just a c@@ and@@ le in a h@@ ol@@ der , and imagine that we want to fig@@ ure out what it is made of ."
So we go on a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y de@@ ep inside the ob@@ ject and ex@@ am@@ ine the con@@ sti@@ tu@@ ents .
"So de@@ ep inside — we all know , you go suff@@ ici@@ ently far down , you have at@@ oms ."
We also all know that at@@ oms are not the end of the story .
They have little electr@@ ons that s@@ war@@ m around a cen@@ tr@@ al n@@ uc@@ le@@ us with ne@@ u@@ tr@@ ons and pr@@ ot@@ ons .
E@@ ven the ne@@ u@@ tr@@ ons and pr@@ ot@@ ons have sm@@ all@@ er particles inside of them known as qu@@ ar@@ ks .
That is where con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal ideas stop .
Here is the new idea of string theory .
"D@@ e@@ ep inside any of these particles , there is something else ."
This something else is this d@@ anc@@ ing fil@@ a@@ ment of energy .
"It looks like a vibr@@ ating string — that &apos;s where the idea , string theory comes from ."
"And just like the vibr@@ ating str@@ ings that you just saw in a c@@ ell@@ o can vibr@@ ate in different patter@@ ns , these can also vibr@@ ate in different patter@@ ns ."
They don &apos;t pro@@ duce different mu@@ sical n@@ ot@@ es .
"@@ R@@ a@@ ther , they pro@@ duce the different particles making up the world around us ."
"So if these ideas are cor@@ re@@ ct , this is what the ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of the universe looks like ."
"It &apos;s built up of a hu@@ ge number of these little tiny fil@@ am@@ ents of vibr@@ ating energy , vibr@@ ating in different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
The different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ ci@@ es pro@@ duce the different particles .
The different particles are respon@@ sible for all the ri@@ ch@@ ness in the world around us .
"And there you see uni@@ fi@@ cation , because matter particles , electr@@ ons and qu@@ ar@@ ks , radi@@ ation particles , ph@@ ot@@ ons , gra@@ vit@@ ons , are all built up from one enti@@ ty ."
So matter and the for@@ ces of nature all are put together under the ru@@ bri@@ c of vibr@@ ating str@@ ings .
And that &apos;s what we mean by a uni@@ fied theory .
Now here is the cat@@ ch .
"When you study the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics of string theory , you find that it doesn &apos;t work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space ."
"It doesn &apos;t work in a universe with four dimensions of space , n@@ or five , n@@ or six ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , you can study the equ@@ ations , and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimen@@ sion of time ."
"It lea@@ ds us right back to this idea of K@@ alu@@ z@@ a and K@@ le@@ in — that our world , when appro@@ pri@@ ately describ@@ ed , has more dimensions than the ones that we see ."
"Now you might think about that and say , well , O@@ K , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they &apos;re really ti@@ gh@@ tly cur@@ led up , ye@@ a@@ h , perhaps we won &apos;t see them , if they &apos;re small enough ."
"But if there &apos;s a little tiny ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation of gre@@ en people wal@@ king around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them ei@@ ther . That is true ."
"One of the other pre@@ dic@@ tions of string theory — no , that &apos;s not one of the other pre@@ dic@@ tions of string theory ."
"( Laughter ) But it ra@@ is@@ es the question : are we just trying to hi@@ de away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?"
"In the re@@ ma@@ ining time , I &apos;d like to tell you two fe@@ atures of them ."
"F@@ irst is , many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the de@@ e@@ pe@@ st question in the@@ o@@ re@@ tical physics , the@@ o@@ re@@ tical science ."
"And that question is this : when we look around the world , as scienti@@ sts have done for the last hundred years , there appe@@ ar to be about 20 numbers that really descri@@ be our universe ."
"Th@@ ese are numbers like the ma@@ ss of the particles , like electr@@ ons and qu@@ ar@@ ks , the str@@ eng@@ th of gravity , the str@@ eng@@ th of the electr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic force — a li@@ st of about 20 numbers that have been meas@@ u@@ red with incredi@@ ble preci@@ sion , but no@@ body has an ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the numbers have the particular valu@@ es that they do ."
"Now , does string theory off@@ er an answer ?"
No@@ t yet .
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the valu@@ es they do may re@@ ly on the form of the extra dimensions .
"And the wonderful thing is , if those numbers had any other valu@@ es than the known ones , the universe , as we know it , wouldn &apos;t ex@@ ist ."
This is a de@@ ep question .
"Wh@@ y are those numbers so fin@@ ely t@@ un@@ ed to all@@ ow stars to sh@@ ine and planets to form , when we recogn@@ ize that if you fi@@ ddle with those numbers — if I had 20 di@@ als up here and I let you come up and fi@@ ddle with those numbers , almost any fi@@ dd@@ ling makes the universe dis@@ appe@@ ar ."
So can we explain those 20 numbers ?
And string theory sug@@ ge@@ sts that those 20 numbers have to do with the extra dimensions .
Let me show you how .
"So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory , it &apos;s not one extra dimen@@ sion , as in the ol@@ der ideas of K@@ alu@@ z@@ a and K@@ le@@ in ."
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions .
"They have a very rich , inter@@ tw@@ ined ge@@ ome@@ try ."
This is an example of something known as a C@@ al@@ ab@@ i@@ -@@ Y@@ a@@ u shape — na@@ me isn &apos;t all that important .
"But , as you can see , the extra dimensions f@@ old in on the@@ m@@ selves and inter@@ tw@@ ine in a very interesting shape , interesting struc@@ ture ."
"And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like , then the mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of our universe all around us would look like this on the t@@ ini@@ est of sc@@ al@@ es ."
"When you s@@ wing your hand , you &apos;d be mo@@ ving around these extra dimensions over and over again , but they &apos;re so small that we wouldn &apos;t know it ."
"So what is the phy@@ sical imp@@ li@@ cation , though , rele@@ v@@ ant to those 20 numbers ?"
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der this . I@@ f you look at the in@@ str@@ ument , a F@@ r@@ en@@ ch h@@ or@@ n , no@@ tice that the vi@@ bra@@ tions of the a@@ ir@@ stre@@ a@@ ms are a@@ ffec@@ ted by the shape of the in@@ str@@ ument ."
"Now in string theory , all the numbers are re@@ f@@ lec@@ tions of the way str@@ ings can vibr@@ ate ."
"So just as those a@@ ir@@ stre@@ a@@ ms are a@@ ffec@@ ted by the tw@@ ist@@ s and turns in the in@@ str@@ ument , str@@ ings the@@ m@@ selves will be a@@ ffec@@ ted by the vi@@ bra@@ tional patter@@ ns in the ge@@ ome@@ try within which they are mo@@ ving ."
So let me bring some str@@ ings into the story .
"And if you wat@@ ch these little f@@ el@@ lo@@ ws vibr@@ ating around — they &apos;ll be there in a second — right there , no@@ tice that they way they vibr@@ ate is a@@ ffec@@ ted by the ge@@ ome@@ try of the extra dimensions ."
"So , if we knew ex@@ actly what the extra dimensions look like — we don &apos;t yet , but if we did — we should be able to cal@@ cul@@ ate the allowed n@@ ot@@ es , the allowed vi@@ bra@@ tional patter@@ ns ."
"And if we could cal@@ cul@@ ate the allowed vi@@ bra@@ tional patter@@ ns , we should be able to cal@@ cul@@ ate those 20 numbers ."
"And if the answer that we get from our cal@@ c@@ ula@@ tions ag@@ re@@ es with the valu@@ es of those numbers that have been de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed through deta@@ il@@ ed and preci@@ se experi@@ men@@ ta@@ tion , this in many ways would be the first f@@ und@@ am@@ ental ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the struc@@ ture of the universe is the way it is ."
"Now , the second is@@ sue that I want to fin@@ ish up with is : how might we test for these extra dimensions more direc@@ tly ?"
"It &apos;s a mach@@ ine that will s@@ end particles around a t@@ un@@ ne@@ l , op@@ pos@@ ite direc@@ tions , ne@@ ar the spe@@ ed of light ."
"E@@ very so o@@ f@@ ten those particles will be a@@ im@@ ed at each other , so there &apos;s a he@@ ad@@ -@@ on col@@ li@@ sion ."
"The hop@@ e is that if the col@@ li@@ sion has enough energy , it may e@@ ject some of the de@@ br@@ is from the col@@ li@@ sion from our dimensions , for@@ c@@ ing it to en@@ ter into the other dimensions ."
How would we know it ?
"Well , we &apos;ll measure the amount of energy after the col@@ li@@ sion , comp@@ are it to the amount of energy before , and if there &apos;s less energy after the col@@ li@@ sion than before , this will be evi@@ dence that the energy has dri@@ f@@ ted away ."
"And if it dri@@ f@@ ts away in the right patter@@ n that we can cal@@ cul@@ ate , this will be evi@@ dence that the extra dimensions are there ."
Let me show you that idea vi@@ su@@ ally .
"So , imagine we have a certain kind of partic@@ le called a gra@@ vit@@ on — that &apos;s the kind of de@@ br@@ is we expe@@ ct to be e@@ jec@@ ted out , if the extra dimensions are real ."
But here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
You take these particles . You s@@ la@@ m them together .
"You s@@ la@@ m them together , and if we are right , some of the energy of that col@@ li@@ sion will go into de@@ br@@ is that f@@ lies off into these extra dimensions ."
"So this is the kind of experiment that we &apos;ll be looking at in the next five , se@@ ven to 10 years or so ."
"And if this experiment be@@ ar@@ s f@@ ru@@ it , if we see that kind of partic@@ le e@@ jec@@ ted by no@@ tic@@ ing that there &apos;s less energy in our dimensions than when we beg@@ an , this will show that the extra dimensions are real ."
"E@@ instein comes along and says , well , space and time can war@@ p and cur@@ ve — that &apos;s what gravity is ."
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our li@@ fe@@ time .
A@@ ma@@ zing pos@@ sibi@@ lity .
"E@@ very one of you kno@@ ws that the r@@ ate of change s@@ lo@@ ws over the human li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an , that your children seem to change by the minu@@ te but your par@@ ents seem to change by the year ."
But what is the na@@ me of this ma@@ gi@@ cal point in life where change su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly goes from a g@@ allo@@ p to a c@@ ra@@ w@@ l ?
I@@ s it te@@ en@@ age years ? I@@ s it mi@@ ddle age ?
D@@ o@@ es any of this matter ?
They need to be part of the p@@ ack .
"I still remem@@ ber the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 19@@ 60 ."
"I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has chang@@ ed from that year and into the future , but I will not use di@@ g@@ ital technology , as I &apos;ve done d@@ uring my first five TE@@ D@@ T@@ al@@ ks ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I have progre@@ ss@@ ed , and I am , today , la@@ un@@ ching a br@@ and new an@@ al@@ o@@ g teach@@ ing technology that I pic@@ ked up from I@@ K@@ E@@ A : this bo@@ x ."
This bo@@ x con@@ ta@@ ins one billion people .
"And our teacher told us that the in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized world , 19@@ 60 , had one billion people ."
"In the develop@@ ing world , she said , they had two billion people ."
And they li@@ ved away then .
There was a big ga@@ p between the one billion in the in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized world and the two billion in the develop@@ ing world .
"In the in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized world , people were heal@@ thy , edu@@ ca@@ ted , rich , and they had small fami@@ lies ."
And their as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion was to buy a ca@@ r .
"And in 19@@ 60 , all S@@ wed@@ es were sa@@ ving to try to buy a V@@ ol@@ v@@ o like this ."
This was the economic level at which S@@ wed@@ en was .
"But in con@@ tra@@ st to this , in the develop@@ ing world , far away , the as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion of the average family there was to have f@@ ood for the day ."
They were sa@@ ving to be able to buy a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es .
There was an en@@ orm@@ ous ga@@ p in the world when I gre@@ w up .
"And this ga@@ p between the W@@ est and the rest has cre@@ ated a min@@ d@@ set of the world , which we still use l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic@@ ally when we talk about &quot; &quot; the W@@ est &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ing World . &quot; &quot; But the world has chang@@ ed , and it &apos;s o@@ ver@@ du@@ e to up@@ gra@@ de that min@@ d@@ set and that ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y of the world , and to understand it ."
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because since 19@@ 60 what has happened in the world up to 20@@ 10 is that a st@@ ag@@ g@@ ering four billion people have been ad@@ ded to the world population ."
J@@ ust look how many .
The world population has d@@ ou@@ b@@ led since I went to school .
"And of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the W@@ est ."
"A lot of comp@@ an@@ ies have happened to grow the econom@@ y , so the W@@ est@@ er@@ n population mo@@ ved over to here ."
And now their as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion is not only to have a ca@@ r .
Now they want to have a h@@ o@@ li@@ day on a very re@@ m@@ ote de@@ st@@ in@@ ation and they want to f@@ ly .
So this is where they are today .
"And the most success@@ ful of the develop@@ ing countries , they have mo@@ ved on , you know , and they have become e@@ mer@@ g@@ ing econom@@ ies , we call them ."
They are now bu@@ ying car@@ s .
"And what happened a mon@@ th ago was that the Chin@@ ese comp@@ any , G@@ e@@ ely , they ac@@ qui@@ red the V@@ ol@@ v@@ o comp@@ any , and then fin@@ ally the S@@ wed@@ es underst@@ ood that something big had happened in the world ."
( Laughter ) So there they are .
"And the tra@@ ge@@ dy is that the two billion over here that is str@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling for f@@ ood and sho@@ es , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago ."
"The new thing is that we have the big@@ gest pi@@ le of b@@ illions , the three b@@ illions here , which are also be@@ coming e@@ mer@@ g@@ ing econom@@ ies , because they are quite heal@@ thy , rela@@ tively well-@@ edu@@ ca@@ ted , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; ri@@ ch@@ er also &#93; have ."
"And their as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion now is , of course , to buy a b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le , and then later on they would like to have a m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke also ."
"But this is the world we have today , no longer any ga@@ p ."
"But the dist@@ ance from the p@@ oo@@ rest here , the very p@@ oo@@ rest , to the very ri@@ ch@@ est over here is wi@@ der than ever ."
"But there is a continu@@ ous world from wal@@ king , bi@@ king , dri@@ ving , fl@@ ying — there are people on all le@@ vel@@ s , and most people t@@ end to be some@@ where in the mi@@ ddle ."
This is the new world we have today in 20@@ 10 .
And what will happen in the future ?
"Well , I &apos;m going to pro@@ ject into 20@@ 50 ."
"I was in S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i rec@@ ently , and I li@@ st@@ en@@ ed to what &apos;s happening in China , and it &apos;s pretty s@@ ure that they will cat@@ ch up , just as Japan did ."
A@@ ll the pro@@ jec@@ tions &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
"@@ &#91; But this second &#93; gro@@ ws with se@@ ven , eight percent , and then they will end up here ."
They will start fl@@ ying .
"And these lo@@ wer or mi@@ ddle income countries , the e@@ mer@@ g@@ ing income countries , they will also for@@ ge for@@ wards econom@@ ically ."
"And if , but only if , we in@@ ve@@ st in the right gre@@ en technology — so that we can a@@ vo@@ id se@@ v@@ ere c@@ lim@@ ate change , and energy can still be rela@@ tively ch@@ ea@@ p — then they will move all the way up here ."
And they will start to buy electri@@ c car@@ s .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the p@@ oo@@ rest two billion ?
What about the p@@ oo@@ rest two billion here ?
W@@ ill they move on ?
"Well , here population &#91; growth &#93; comes in because there &#91; am@@ ong e@@ mer@@ g@@ ing econom@@ ies &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family plan@@ ning is w@@ ide@@ ly used , and population growth is coming to an end ."
"@@ Here &#91; am@@ ong the p@@ oo@@ rest &#93; , population is gro@@ wing ."
"So these &#91; p@@ oo@@ rest &#93; two billion will , in the next de@@ ca@@ des , increase to three billion , and they will ther@@ e@@ after increase to four billion ."
There is nothing — but a n@@ uc@@ lear war of a kind we &apos;ve never se@@ en — that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
"But if , and only if , &#91; the p@@ oo@@ rest &#93; get out of po@@ ver@@ ty , they get education , they get impro@@ ved child survi@@ val , they can buy a b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le and a cell ph@@ one and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population growth will stop in 20@@ 50 ."
We cannot have people on this level looking for f@@ ood and sho@@ es because then we get continu@@ ed population growth .
And let me show you why by con@@ ver@@ ting back to the ol@@ d@@ -@@ time di@@ g@@ ital technology .
Here I have on the s@@ cre@@ en my country bub@@ b@@ les .
E@@ very bub@@ ble is a country . The si@@ ze is population .
The col@@ ors show the contin@@ ent .
The y@@ ell@@ ow on there is the Americ@@ as ; dark b@@ lu@@ e is A@@ fri@@ c@@ a ; bro@@ wn is Eu@@ rop@@ e ; gre@@ en is the M@@ i@@ ddle E@@ a@@ st and this light b@@ lu@@ e is S@@ ou@@ th A@@ si@@ a .
That &apos;s India and this is China . S@@ ize is population .
"@@ Here I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children — big fami@@ lies , small fami@@ lies ."
The year is 19@@ 60 .
"And down here , child survi@@ val , the per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of children survi@@ ving ch@@ il@@ d@@ h@@ ood up to star@@ ting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 80 percent , 9@@ 0 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the we@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ est and heal@@ th@@ i@@ est countries ."
"But look , this is the world my teacher tal@@ ked about in 19@@ 60 : one billion W@@ est@@ er@@ n world here — high ch@@ il@@ d@@ -@@ survi@@ val , small fami@@ lies — and all the rest , the ra@@ in@@ b@@ ow of develop@@ ing countries , with very lar@@ ge fami@@ lies and poor child survi@@ val ."
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
"C@@ an you see , as the years pas@@ s by , child survi@@ val is increas@@ ing ?"
"They get so@@ a@@ p , hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , education , v@@ acc@@ in@@ ation , p@@ en@@ ic@@ il@@ l@@ in and then family plan@@ ning . F@@ a@@ mi@@ ly si@@ ze is de@@ cre@@ as@@ ing ."
"@@ &#91; Wh@@ en &#93; they get up to 9@@ 0@@ -@@ percent child survi@@ val , then fami@@ lies de@@ cre@@ ase , and most of the A@@ ra@@ b countries in the M@@ i@@ ddle E@@ a@@ st is f@@ all@@ ing down there &#91; to small fami@@ lies &#93; ."
"@@ L@@ ook , B@@ ang@@ la@@ de@@ sh cat@@ ching up with India ."
"The whole e@@ mer@@ g@@ ing world jo@@ ins the W@@ est@@ er@@ n world with good child survi@@ val and small family si@@ ze , but we still have the p@@ oo@@ rest billion ."
"C@@ an you see the p@@ oo@@ rest billion , those &#91; two &#93; bo@@ x@@ es I had over here ?"
They are still up here .
"And they still have a child survi@@ val of only 70 to 80 percent , me@@ an@@ ing that if you have six children born , there will be at lea@@ st four who survi@@ ve to the next gener@@ ation ."
And the population will d@@ ou@@ ble in one gener@@ ation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to continu@@ e to impro@@ ve child survi@@ val to 9@@ 0 percent .
"That &apos;s why in@@ ve@@ st@@ ments by G@@ ates F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation , U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F and a@@ id organiz@@ ations , together with national govern@@ ment in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries , are so good ; because they are actually hel@@ p@@ ing us to re@@ ach a su@@ sta@@ in@@ able population si@@ ze of the world ."
We can stop at n@@ ine billion if we do the right things .
C@@ hi@@ ld survi@@ val is the new gre@@ en .
It &apos;s only by child survi@@ val that we will stop population growth .
And will it happen ?
"Well , I &apos;m not an op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st , ne@@ i@@ ther am I a pe@@ s@@ si@@ mi@@ st ."
"I &apos;m a very ser@@ i@@ ous &quot; &quot; pos@@ sibi@@ li@@ st . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a new ca@@ te@@ g@@ ory where we take e@@ mo@@ tion ap@@ ar@@ t , and we just work an@@ al@@ y@@ tic@@ ally with the world ."
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
"@@ W@@ it@@ h gre@@ en technology and with in@@ ve@@ st@@ ments to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate po@@ ver@@ ty , and global govern@@ ance , the world can become like this ."
And look at the position of the old W@@ est .
"@@ Re@@ mem@@ ber when this b@@ lu@@ e bo@@ x was all al@@ one , lead@@ ing the world , li@@ ving its own life ."
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
"The ro@@ le of the old W@@ est in the new world is to become the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of the modern world — nothing more , nothing less ."
But it &apos;s a very important ro@@ le .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .

Su@@ pp@@ ose that two American fri@@ ends are tra@@ vel@@ ing together in I@@ tal@@ y .
"The second guy — we &apos;ll call him B@@ ill — is trans@@ fi@@ x@@ ed by em@@ b@@ ar@@ r@@ as@@ s@@ ment , at star@@ ing at the thing there in the cen@@ ter ."
"So here &apos;s my question for you : which one of these two gu@@ ys was more li@@ ke@@ ly to have v@@ ot@@ ed for G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h , which for A@@ l G@@ ore ?"
"And in this case , the ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e cor@@ respon@@ ds to reality ."
It really is a fact that liber@@ als are much high@@ er than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves on a ma@@ j@@ or per@@ s@@ on@@ ality tra@@ it called op@@ en@@ ness to experience .
"@@ Pe@@ ople low on it like things that are fami@@ li@@ ar , that are sa@@ fe and dep@@ end@@ able ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you understand this tra@@ it , you can understand why any@@ body would e@@ at at App@@ le@@ be@@ e &apos;s , but not any@@ body that you know ."
( Laughter ) This tra@@ it also t@@ ells us a lot about poli@@ tics .
This tra@@ it also t@@ ells us a lot about the kinds of groups people jo@@ in .
So here &apos;s the descri@@ p@@ tion of a group I found on the W@@ e@@ b .
Let &apos;s find out .
"I &apos;m going to ask you to ra@@ ise your hand , whether you are liber@@ al , left of cen@@ ter — on social is@@ su@@ es , we &apos;re talking about , pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly — or con@@ serv@@ ative , and I &apos;ll give a th@@ ir@@ d op@@ tion , because I know there are a number of liber@@ t@@ ari@@ ans in the au@@ di@@ ence ."
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand high right now . O@@ K .
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re liber@@ t@@ ari@@ an .
"O@@ K , about a — two do@@ z@@ en ."
And ple@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;d say you are right of cen@@ ter or con@@ serv@@ ative .
O@@ K . This is a bit of a problem .
"Because if our go@@ al is to understand the world , to see@@ k a de@@ e@@ per underst@@ anding of the world , our gener@@ al l@@ ack of moral di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity here is going to make it har@@ der ."
"Because when people all share valu@@ es , when people all share mor@@ als , they become a te@@ am , and once you eng@@ age the psycho@@ logy of te@@ a@@ ms , it sh@@ u@@ ts down op@@ en@@ -@@ min@@ ded thinking ."
"When the liber@@ al te@@ am l@@ os@@ es , as it did in 200@@ 4 , and as it almost did in 2@@ 000 , we com@@ for@@ t our@@ selves ."
( Laughter ) We try to explain why half of America v@@ ot@@ ed for the other te@@ am .
"We think they must be bl@@ in@@ ded by religi@@ on , or by simple stu@@ pi@@ d@@ ity ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , if you think that half of America v@@ ot@@ es Re@@ publi@@ can because they are bl@@ in@@ ded in this way , then my mes@@ sage to you is that you &apos;re tr@@ app@@ ed in a moral mat@@ ri@@ x , in a particular moral mat@@ ri@@ x ."
"I was going to ask you which one you pic@@ ked , but no need ."
Let &apos;s study some moral psycho@@ logy and see where it ta@@ kes us .
What is mor@@ ality and where does it come from ?
The wor@@ st idea in all of psycho@@ logy is the idea that the mind is a bl@@ ank s@@ l@@ ate at b@@ ir@@ th .
"He says , &quot; &quot; The ini@@ ti@@ al organiz@@ ation of the brain does not dep@@ end that much on experience ."
It gi@@ ves us very strong feel@@ ings about those who cause har@@ m .
This moral f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation under@@ lies about 70 percent of the moral st@@ at@@ e@@ ments I &apos;ve heard here at TED .
The th@@ ir@@ d f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation is in@@ -@@ group / lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty .
You do find groups in the an@@ im@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom — you do find co@@ op@@ er@@ ative groups — but these groups are always ei@@ ther very small or they &apos;re all si@@ bl@@ ings .
"It &apos;s only am@@ ong hum@@ ans that you find very lar@@ ge groups of people who are able to co@@ op@@ er@@ ate , jo@@ in together into groups , but in this case , groups that are un@@ ited to fi@@ ght other groups ."
"This probably comes from our long history of tri@@ b@@ al li@@ ving , of tri@@ b@@ al psycho@@ logy ."
( Laughter ) S@@ p@@ orts is to war as p@@ or@@ no@@ grap@@ h@@ y is to sex .
"We get to ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se some an@@ ci@@ ent , an@@ ci@@ ent dri@@ ves ."
The f@@ our@@ th f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation is au@@ th@@ or@@ ity / re@@ spe@@ ct .
Here you see sub@@ mis@@ sive ge@@ stu@@ res from two mem@@ bers of very cl@@ os@@ ely re@@ l@@ ated speci@@ es .
"It &apos;s based on more v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary de@@ fer@@ ence , and even el@@ e@@ ments of love , at times ."
The fi@@ f@@ th f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation is pur@@ ity / s@@ anc@@ ti@@ ty .
"This pain@@ ting is called &quot; &quot; The A@@ l@@ le@@ g@@ ory O@@ f C@@ ha@@ sti@@ ty , &quot; &quot; but pur@@ ity &apos;s not just about su@@ p@@ press@@ ing fe@@ m@@ ale se@@ x@@ u@@ ality ."
"And so far , 3@@ 0,000 people have taken this ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ir@@ e , and you can too ."
Here are the results .
"@@ Here are the results from about 2@@ 3@@ ,000 American ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ."
"They give high end@@ or@@ se@@ ment of these s@@ orts of st@@ at@@ e@@ ments all across the bo@@ ard , but as you also see , liber@@ als care about it a little more than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves — the l@@ ine s@@ lo@@ p@@ es down ."
We find this in every country we look at .
I &apos;ll just f@@ li@@ p through a few other sli@@ des .
"@@ No@@ tice also that on all of these grap@@ h@@ s , the s@@ lo@@ p@@ e is ste@@ e@@ per on in@@ -@@ group , au@@ th@@ or@@ ity , pur@@ ity ."
"Wh@@ ich sho@@ ws that within any country , the di@@ sa@@ gre@@ ement isn &apos;t over har@@ m and fa@@ ir@@ ness ."
What makes them moral ?
"In the first p@@ an@@ el , we see the moment of cre@@ ation ."
"A@@ ll is ord@@ er@@ ed , all is beautiful , all the people and an@@ im@@ als are doing what they &apos;re supp@@ osed to be doing , where they &apos;re supp@@ osed to be ."
"But then , gi@@ ven the way of the world , things change ."
"We get every person doing wh@@ at@@ ever he wan@@ ts , with every ap@@ er@@ ture of every other person and every other an@@ im@@ al ."
S@@ ome of you might recogn@@ ize this as the &apos; 6@@ 0s .
"( Laughter ) But the &apos; 6@@ 0s in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably gi@@ ves way to the &apos; 7@@ 0s , where the cu@@ tt@@ ings of the ap@@ er@@ tures h@@ ur@@ t a little bit more ."
"O@@ f course , B@@ os@@ ch called this h@@ ell ."
"So this tri@@ p@@ t@@ y@@ ch , these three p@@ an@@ el@@ s p@@ or@@ tr@@ ay the tim@@ el@@ ess tru@@ th that order t@@ ends to de@@ ca@@ y ."
The tru@@ th of social entropy .
"O@@ n the first r@@ ound , people give about half of the money that they can ."
"But they quic@@ kly see , &quot; &quot; You know what , other people ar@@ en &apos;t doing so much though ."
"I don &apos;t want to be a su@@ c@@ ker . I &apos;m not going to co@@ op@@ er@@ ate . &quot; &quot; And so co@@ op@@ er@@ ation quic@@ kly de@@ ca@@ ys from reas@@ on@@ ably good , down to cl@@ ose to z@@ er@@ o ."
"But then — and here &apos;s the tri@@ ck — F@@ e@@ h@@ r and G@@ ach@@ ter said , on the se@@ v@@ en@@ th r@@ ound , they told people , &quot; &quot; You know what ? New ru@@ le ."
Because I think that the gre@@ at@@ est won@@ der in the world is not the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on .
The G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on is really simple .
"It &apos;s just a lot of ro@@ ck , and then a lot of water and w@@ ind , and a lot of time , and you get the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on ."
It &apos;s not that comp@@ lica@@ ted .
"This is an ab@@ solu@@ te m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le , much har@@ der to explain than the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on ."
And now we get to the c@@ ru@@ x of the di@@ sa@@ gre@@ ement between liber@@ als and con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves .
This is the great in@@ sight that all the A@@ si@@ an religi@@ ons have at@@ ta@@ ined .
Th@@ ink about y@@ in and y@@ ang .
You find the same thing in H@@ in@@ du@@ ism .
There are many high go@@ ds in H@@ in@@ du@@ ism .
"T@@ w@@ o of them are V@@ i@@ sh@@ n@@ u , the pre@@ ser@@ ver , and S@@ hi@@ v@@ a , the de@@ stro@@ y@@ er ."
This i@@ ma@@ ge actually is both of those go@@ ds sh@@ ar@@ ing the same body .
"You have the mark@@ ings of V@@ i@@ sh@@ n@@ u on the left , so we could think of V@@ i@@ sh@@ n@@ u as the con@@ serv@@ ative go@@ d ."
"You have the mark@@ ings of S@@ hi@@ v@@ a on the right , S@@ hi@@ v@@ a &apos;s the liber@@ al go@@ d . And they work together ."
"Th@@ ese two st@@ an@@ z@@ as con@@ tain , I think , the de@@ e@@ pe@@ st in@@ si@@ ghts that have ever been at@@ ta@@ ined into moral psycho@@ logy ."
"F@@ rom the Z@@ en ma@@ ster S@@ eng@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an : &quot; &quot; I@@ f you want the tru@@ th to st@@ and c@@ lear before you , never be for or against ."
"The str@@ u@@ g@@ gle between for and against is the mind &apos;s wor@@ st disease . &quot; &quot; Now un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately , it &apos;s a disease that has been ca@@ u@@ ght by many of the world &apos;s lead@@ ers ."
"But before you feel su@@ peri@@ or to G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h , before you th@@ row a st@@ one , ask yourself , do you ac@@ cept this ?"
Do you ac@@ cept ste@@ pp@@ ing out of the b@@ att@@ le of good and evi@@ l ?
C@@ an you be not for or against anything ?
"So , what &apos;s the point ? What should you do ?"
So what should you do ? A@@ m I t@@ elling you to not stri@@ ve ?
"A@@ m I t@@ elling you to em@@ br@@ ace S@@ eng@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an and stop , stop with this str@@ u@@ g@@ gle of for and against ?"
"@@ No , ab@@ solu@@ tely not . I &apos;m not saying that ."
"But as we learned from S@@ am@@ an@@ th@@ a P@@ o@@ wer , in her story about S@@ er@@ gi@@ o V@@ i@@ e@@ ir@@ a de M@@ ell@@ o , you can &apos;t just go char@@ g@@ ing in , saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wrong , and I &apos;m right . &quot; &quot; Because , as we just heard , everybody thin@@ ks they are right ."
A lot of the problems we have to sol@@ ve are problems that re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e us to change other people .
Th@@ ink about the en@@ orm@@ ous moral au@@ th@@ or@@ ity of the D@@ ala@@ i L@@ am@@ a — and it comes from his moral hu@@ mi@@ lity .
"So I think the point — the point of my talk , and I think the point of TED — is that this is a group that is pas@@ sion@@ ately eng@@ ag@@ ed in the pur@@ su@@ it of chang@@ ing the world for the better ."
Pe@@ ople here are pas@@ sion@@ ately eng@@ ag@@ ed in trying to make the world a better place .
But there is also a pas@@ sion@@ ate comm@@ it@@ ment to the tru@@ th .
And so I think that the answer is to use that pas@@ sion@@ ate comm@@ it@@ ment to the tru@@ th to try to turn it into a better future for us all .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I@@ s there anything uni@@ qu@@ e about human be@@ ings ?
There is .
We &apos;re the only cre@@ atures with fully developed moral s@@ enti@@ ments .
We &apos;re ob@@ se@@ ss@@ ed with mor@@ ality as social cre@@ atures .
We need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
And I per@@ s@@ on@@ ally am ob@@ se@@ ss@@ ed with mor@@ ality .
"It was all du@@ e to this woman , S@@ ist@@ er M@@ ary M@@ ar@@ a@@ st@@ el@@ a , also known as my mo@@ m ."
"As an al@@ ta@@ r bo@@ y , I brea@@ th@@ ed in a lot of in@@ cen@@ se , and I learned to say ph@@ r@@ as@@ es in L@@ ati@@ n , but I also had time to think about whether my mother &apos;s t@@ op@@ -@@ down mor@@ ality app@@ li@@ ed to everybody ."
I saw that people who were religi@@ ous and n@@ on@@ -@@ religi@@ ous were equ@@ ally ob@@ se@@ ss@@ ed with mor@@ ality .
"I thought , maybe there &apos;s some ear@@ th@@ ly bas@@ is for moral deci@@ sions ."
But I wanted to go f@@ ur@@ ther than to say our bra@@ ins make us moral .
I want to know if there &apos;s a che@@ mi@@ str@@ y of mor@@ ality . I want to know
if there was a moral mo@@ lec@@ u@@ le .
"A@@ f@@ ter 10 years of experi@@ ments , I found it ."
W@@ ould you like to see it ? I br@@ ought some with me .
This little sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge con@@ ta@@ ins the moral mo@@ lec@@ u@@ le .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s called oxytocin .
So oxytocin is a simple and an@@ ci@@ ent mo@@ lec@@ u@@ le found only in ma@@ mm@@ als .
"In ro@@ d@@ ents , it was known to make mo@@ thers care for their off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing , and in some cre@@ atures , allowed for t@@ ol@@ er@@ ation of bur@@ ro@@ w@@ mat@@ es ."
"But in hum@@ ans , it was only known to fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ate b@@ ir@@ th and brea@@ st@@ fe@@ ed@@ ing in women , and is rele@@ as@@ ed by both se@@ x@@ es d@@ uring sex ."
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral mo@@ lec@@ u@@ le .
I did what most of us do — I tried it on some colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es .
"One of them told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ au@@ l , that is the world &apos;s stu@@ pi@@ di@@ st idea ."
"It is , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; only a fe@@ m@@ ale mo@@ lec@@ u@@ le ."
"It can &apos;t be that important . &quot; &quot; But I coun@@ ter@@ ed , &quot; &quot; Well men &apos;s bra@@ ins make this too ."
"There must be a reason why . &quot; &quot; But he was right , it was a stu@@ p@@ id idea ."
But it was test@@ ably stu@@ p@@ id .
"In other words , I thought I could desi@@ gn an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral ."
T@@ ur@@ ns out it was@@ n &apos;t so easy .
"F@@ irst of all , oxytocin is a sh@@ y mo@@ lec@@ u@@ le ."
"B@@ as@@ el@@ ine le@@ vel@@ s are ne@@ ar z@@ er@@ o , without some sti@@ mul@@ us to cause its rele@@ ase ."
"And when it &apos;s produc@@ ed , it has a thre@@ e-@@ minu@@ te hal@@ f-@@ life , and de@@ gra@@ des r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly at room te@@ m@@ per@@ ature ."
"So this experiment would have to cause a sur@@ ge of oxytocin , have to gra@@ b it fa@@ st and keep it co@@ ld ."
I think I can do that .
"Now l@@ uc@@ ki@@ ly , oxytocin is produc@@ ed both in the brain and in the b@@ loo@@ d , so I could do this experiment without learning neur@@ os@@ ur@@ g@@ ery ."
Th@@ en I had to measure mor@@ ality .
So ta@@ king on M@@ or@@ ality with a cap@@ ital M is a hu@@ ge pro@@ ject .
So I started sm@@ all@@ er .
I studi@@ ed one single vir@@ tu@@ e : tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
Why ? I had sho@@ wn in the early 20@@ 00@@ s that countries with a high@@ er pro@@ p@@ or@@ tion of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy people are more pr@@ os@@ per@@ ous .
"So in these countries , more economic trans@@ ac@@ tions o@@ cc@@ ur and more we@@ al@@ th is cre@@ ated , al@@ le@@ vi@@ ating po@@ ver@@ ty ."
So poor countries are by and lar@@ ge low trust countries .
"So if I underst@@ ood the che@@ mi@@ str@@ y of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess , I might help al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate po@@ ver@@ ty ."
But I &apos;m also a s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic .
"I don &apos;t want to just ask people , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy ? &quot; &quot; So instead I use the J@@ er@@ ry M@@ ag@@ u@@ ir@@ e appro@@ ach to resear@@ ch ."
"If you &apos;re so vir@@ tu@@ ous , show me the money ."
So what we do in my la@@ b is we te@@ mp@@ t people with vir@@ tu@@ e and v@@ ice by using money .
Let me show you how we do that .
So we rec@@ ru@@ it some people for an experiment .
They all get $ 10 if they ag@@ ree to show up .
"We give them lots of in@@ struc@@ tion , and we never ever de@@ ce@@ i@@ ve them ."
Th@@ en we mat@@ ch them in pa@@ ir@@ s by computer .
"And in that pa@@ ir , one person gets a mes@@ sage saying , &quot; &quot; Do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you ear@@ ned for being here and ship it to someone else in the la@@ b ? &quot; &quot; The tri@@ ck is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them ."
You only do it one time .
Now wh@@ at@@ ever you give up gets tri@@ pl@@ ed in the other person &apos;s ac@@ coun@@ t .
You &apos;re going to make them a lot we@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ er .
And they get a mes@@ sage by computer saying person one s@@ ent you this amount of money .
"@@ Do you want to keep it all , or do you want to s@@ end some amount back ?"
So think about this experiment for minu@@ te .
You &apos;re going to s@@ it on these hard c@@ ha@@ ir@@ s for an h@@ our and a half .
S@@ ome ma@@ d scienti@@ st is going to j@@ a@@ b your ar@@ m with a ne@@ ed@@ le and take four tu@@ b@@ es of b@@ loo@@ d .
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stran@@ ger ?
So this was the b@@ ir@@ th of va@@ mp@@ ir@@ e econom@@ ic@@ s .
Ma@@ ke a deci@@ sion and give me some b@@ loo@@ d .
"So in fact , experi@@ mental econom@@ ist@@ s had ru@@ n this test around the world , and for much high@@ er sta@@ kes , and the con@@ sen@@ su@@ s view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust , and the trans@@ f@@ er from the second person back to the first meas@@ u@@ red tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess ."
"But in fact , econom@@ ist@@ s were fl@@ um@@ mo@@ x@@ ed on why the second person would ever re@@ turn any money ."
"They as@@ su@@ m@@ ed money is good , why not keep it all ?"
That &apos;s not what we found .
"We found 9@@ 0 percent of the first deci@@ sion@@ -@@ ma@@ k@@ ers s@@ ent money , and of those who re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved money , 9@@ 5 percent re@@ turned some of it ."
But why ?
"Well by meas@@ uring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved , the more their brain produc@@ ed oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on bo@@ ard , the more money they re@@ turned ."
So we have a bio@@ logy of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
But wa@@ it . What &apos;s wrong with this experiment ?
T@@ w@@ o things .
One is that nothing in the body happens in i@@ so@@ la@@ tion .
"So we meas@@ u@@ red n@@ ine other mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es that inter@@ act with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any effec@@ t ."
But the second is that I still only had this in@@ di@@ re@@ ct relation@@ ship between oxytocin and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
I didn &apos;t know for s@@ ure oxytocin ca@@ used tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
"So to make the experiment , I knew I &apos;d have to go into the brain and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ate oxytocin direc@@ tly ."
I used everything sh@@ ort of a dri@@ ll to get oxytocin into my own brain .
And I found I could do it with a n@@ as@@ al in@@ hal@@ er .
"So along with colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es in Z@@ u@@ rich , we put 200 men on oxytocin or pl@@ ace@@ b@@ o , had that same trust test with money , and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust , we can more than d@@ ou@@ ble the number of people who s@@ ent all their money to a stran@@ ger — all without al@@ ter@@ ing mo@@ od or cogn@@ ition ."
"So oxytocin is the trust mo@@ lec@@ u@@ le , but is it the moral mo@@ lec@@ u@@ le ?"
"@@ U@@ sing the oxytocin in@@ hal@@ er , we r@@ an more studies ."
We showed that oxytocin in@@ fu@@ sion increas@@ es gener@@ os@@ ity in un@@ il@@ at@@ er@@ al mon@@ et@@ ary trans@@ f@@ ers by 80 percent .
We showed it increas@@ es d@@ on@@ ations to char@@ ity by 50 percent .
We &apos;ve also inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ated n@@ on@@ -@@ ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ o@@ logi@@ c ways to ra@@ ise oxytocin .
"Th@@ ese in@@ clu@@ de ma@@ s@@ sage , d@@ anc@@ ing and p@@ ra@@ ying ."
"@@ Y@@ es , my mo@@ m was happy about that last one ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever we ra@@ ise oxytocin , people w@@ il@@ l@@ ing@@ ly op@@ en up their wal@@ le@@ ts and share money with str@@ ang@@ ers ."
But why do they do this ?
What does it feel like when your brain is f@@ loo@@ ded with oxytocin ?
"T@@ o inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate this question , we r@@ an an experiment where we had people wat@@ ch a vi@@ de@@ o of a father and his four year@@ -@@ old son , and his son has ter@@ min@@ al brain c@@ anc@@ er ."
"A@@ f@@ ter they wat@@ ched the vi@@ de@@ o , we had them r@@ ate their feel@@ ings and took b@@ loo@@ d before and after to measure oxytocin ."
The change in oxytocin pre@@ dic@@ ted their feel@@ ings of emp@@ a@@ thy .
So it &apos;s emp@@ a@@ thy that makes us con@@ ne@@ ct to other people .
It &apos;s emp@@ a@@ thy that makes us help other people .
It &apos;s emp@@ a@@ thy that makes us moral .
Now this idea is not new .
"A then un@@ known ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ her n@@ am@@ ed A@@ d@@ am S@@ m@@ it@@ h wr@@ ote a book in 1@@ 7@@ 5@@ 9 called &quot; &quot; The Th@@ e@@ ory of M@@ or@@ al S@@ enti@@ ments . &quot; &quot; In this book , S@@ m@@ it@@ h ar@@ gu@@ ed that we are moral cre@@ atures , not because of a t@@ op@@ -@@ down reason , but for a bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up reason ."
"He said we &apos;re social cre@@ atures , so we share the e@@ mo@@ tions of others ."
"So if I do something that h@@ ur@@ ts you , I feel that pa@@ in ."
So I t@@ end to a@@ vo@@ id that .
"If I do something that makes you happy , I get to share your jo@@ y ."
So I t@@ end to do those things .
"Now this is the same A@@ d@@ am S@@ m@@ it@@ h who , 1@@ 7 years later , would wr@@ ite a little book called &quot; &quot; The W@@ e@@ al@@ th of N@@ ations &quot; &quot; — the f@@ oun@@ ding doc@@ ument of econom@@ ic@@ s ."
"But he was , in fact , a moral ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ her , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral ."
I just found the mo@@ lec@@ u@@ le be@@ h@@ ind it .
"But kno@@ wing that mo@@ lec@@ u@@ le is valu@@ able , because it t@@ ells us how to turn up this behavi@@ or and what turns it off ."
"In particular , it t@@ ells us why we see im@@ mor@@ ality ."
"So to inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate im@@ mor@@ ality , let me bring you back now to 19@@ 80 ."
"I &apos;m wor@@ king at a g@@ as st@@ ation on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of S@@ an@@ t@@ a B@@ ar@@ b@@ ar@@ a , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
"You s@@ it in a g@@ as st@@ ation all day , you see lots of mor@@ ality and im@@ mor@@ ality , let me tell you ."
"So one S@@ und@@ ay af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , a man wal@@ ks into my ca@@ shi@@ er &apos;s bo@@ ot@@ h with this beautiful j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry bo@@ x ."
O@@ p@@ ens it up and there &apos;s a pe@@ ar@@ l nec@@ k@@ l@@ ace inside .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I was in the men &apos;s room ."
"I just found this . What do you think we should do with it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , put it in the l@@ ost and found . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; Well this is very valu@@ able .
"We have to find the ow@@ ner for this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ a . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re trying to deci@@ de what to do with this , and the ph@@ one r@@ ings ."
"And a man says very exc@@ it@@ ed@@ ly , &quot; &quot; I was in your g@@ as st@@ ation a while ago , and I b@@ ought this j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry for my wi@@ fe , and I can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ ear@@ l nec@@ k@@ l@@ ace ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , a guy just found it . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; O@@ h , you &apos;re sa@@ ving my life . Here &apos;s my ph@@ one number ."
T@@ ell that guy to wa@@ it half an h@@ our .
"I &apos;ll be there and I &apos;ll give him a $ 200 re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; G@@ re@@ at , so I tell the guy , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , rela@@ x ."
"@@ G@@ et yourself a f@@ at re@@ ward . L@@ i@@ fe &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t do it ."
"I have this job inter@@ view in G@@ al@@ en@@ a in 15 minutes , and I need this job , I &apos;ve got to go . &quot; &quot; A@@ ga@@ in he asked me , &quot; &quot; What do you think we should do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in high school . I have no idea ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll hold it for you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve been so n@@ ice , let &apos;s sp@@ li@@ t the re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll give you the j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry , you give me a hundred dollars , and when the guy comes ... &quot; &quot; You see it . I was con@@ ned ."
"So this is a cla@@ s@@ sic c@@ on called the pi@@ ge@@ on dro@@ p , and I was the pi@@ ge@@ on ."
"So the way many con@@ s work is not that the con@@ man gets the victi@@ m to trust him , it &apos;s that he sho@@ ws he tru@@ sts the victi@@ m ."
Now we know what happens .
"The victi@@ m &apos;s brain rele@@ as@@ es oxytocin , and you &apos;re op@@ en@@ ing up your wal@@ let or pur@@ se , giving away the money ."
So who are these people who man@@ i@@ pul@@ ate our oxytocin syste@@ ms ?
"We found , test@@ ing thousands of in@@ divi@@ du@@ als , that five percent of the population don &apos;t rele@@ ase oxytocin on sti@@ mul@@ us ."
"So if you trust them , their bra@@ ins don &apos;t rele@@ ase oxytocin ."
"If there &apos;s money on the table , they keep it all ."
So there &apos;s a tech@@ ni@@ cal word for these people in my la@@ b .
We call them ba@@ star@@ ds .
( Laughter ) These are not people you want to have a be@@ er with .
They have many of the at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes of psy@@ ch@@ op@@ a@@ ths .
Now there are other ways the system can be in@@ hi@@ b@@ ited .
One is through impro@@ per n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing .
"So we &apos;ve studi@@ ed se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ab@@ used women , and about half those don &apos;t rele@@ ase oxytocin on sti@@ mul@@ us ."
You need enough n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing for this system to devel@@ o@@ p pro@@ per@@ ly .
"A@@ l@@ so , high stre@@ ss in@@ hi@@ b@@ its oxytocin ."
"So we all know this , when we &apos;re really stre@@ ss@@ ed out , we &apos;re not ac@@ ting our best ."
"There &apos;s another way oxytocin is in@@ hi@@ b@@ ited , which is interesting — through the action of test@@ os@@ ter@@ one ."
"So we , in experi@@ ments , have ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er@@ ed test@@ os@@ ter@@ one to men ."
"And instead of sh@@ ar@@ ing money , they become sel@@ fi@@ sh ."
"But interest@@ ing@@ ly , high test@@ os@@ ter@@ one m@@ al@@ es are also more li@@ ke@@ ly to use their own money to p@@ uni@@ sh others for being sel@@ fi@@ sh ."
"( Laughter ) Now think about this . It means , within our own bio@@ logy , we have the y@@ in and y@@ ang of mor@@ ality ."
"We have oxytocin that connec@@ ts us to others , makes us feel what they feel ."
And we have test@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"And men have 10 times the test@@ os@@ ter@@ one as women , so men do this more than women — we have test@@ os@@ ter@@ one that makes us want to p@@ uni@@ sh people who be@@ have im@@ mor@@ ally ."
We don &apos;t need G@@ od or govern@@ ment t@@ elling us what to do .
It &apos;s all inside of us .
"So you may be wonder@@ ing : these are beautiful l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory experi@@ ments , do they really app@@ ly to real life ?"
"@@ Y@@ ea@@ h , I &apos;ve been wor@@ r@@ ying about that too ."
So I &apos;ve g@@ one out of the la@@ b to see if this really h@@ ol@@ ds in our da@@ i@@ ly lives .
"So last su@@ mm@@ er , I att@@ en@@ ded a wed@@ ding in S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Eng@@ land ."
200 people in this beautiful V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ an man@@ sion .
I didn &apos;t know a single person .
And I dro@@ ve up in my r@@ en@@ ted V@@ au@@ x@@ h@@ all .
And I took out a cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ge and d@@ ry ice and ne@@ ed@@ les and tu@@ b@@ es .
And I took b@@ loo@@ d from the bri@@ de and the gro@@ om and the wed@@ ding par@@ ty and the family and the fri@@ ends before and im@@ medi@@ ately after the vo@@ ws .
( Laughter ) And gu@@ ess what ?
"@@ W@@ ed@@ d@@ ings cause a rele@@ ase of oxytocin , but they do so in a very particular way ."
Wh@@ o is the cen@@ ter of the wed@@ ding solar system ?
The bri@@ de .
She had the big@@ gest increase in oxytocin .
Wh@@ o lo@@ ves the wed@@ ding almost as much as the bri@@ de ?
"H@@ er mother , that &apos;s right ."
H@@ er mother was number two .
"Th@@ en the gro@@ om &apos;s father , then the gro@@ om , then the family , then the fri@@ ends — ar@@ ra@@ y@@ ed around the bri@@ de like planets around the Sun ."
"So I think it t@@ ells us that we &apos;ve de@@ sign@@ ed this r@@ it@@ u@@ al to con@@ ne@@ ct us to this new couple , con@@ ne@@ ct us e@@ mo@@ tion@@ ally ."
Why ? Because we need them to be success@@ ful at re@@ produc@@ ing to per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ate the speci@@ es .
I also wor@@ ri@@ ed that my trust experi@@ ments with small amoun@@ ts of money didn &apos;t really cap@@ ture how o@@ f@@ ten we actually trust our lives to str@@ ang@@ ers .
"So even though I have a fe@@ ar of he@@ i@@ ghts , I rec@@ ently str@@ app@@ ed my@@ self to another human being and ste@@ pp@@ ed out of an a@@ ir@@ plan@@ e at 1@@ 2@@ ,000 ft ."
"I took my b@@ loo@@ d before and after , and I had a hu@@ ge sp@@ i@@ ke of oxytocin ."
And there are so many ways we can con@@ ne@@ ct to people .
"For example , through social medi@@ a ."
M@@ any people are T@@ wee@@ ting right now .
So we inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ated the ro@@ le of social medi@@ a and found the using social medi@@ a produc@@ ed a so@@ li@@ d d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ di@@ g@@ it increase in oxytocin .
So I r@@ an this experiment rec@@ ently for the K@@ o@@ re@@ an B@@ ro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st@@ ing S@@ y@@ ste@@ m .
And they had the rep@@ or@@ ters and their produc@@ ers par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate .
"And one of these gu@@ ys , he must have been 2@@ 2 , he had 150 percent sp@@ i@@ ke in oxytocin ."
"I mean , a@@ st@@ oun@@ ding ; no one has this ."
So he was using social medi@@ a in pri@@ v@@ ate .
"When I wr@@ ote my rep@@ ort to the K@@ o@@ re@@ ans , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , I don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot; &quot; but my gu@@ ess was inter@@ ac@@ ting with his mother or his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end ."
They ch@@ ec@@ ked .
He was inter@@ ac@@ ting on his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end &apos;s F@@ ace@@ book p@@ age .
There you go . That &apos;s connec@@ tion .
"So there &apos;s t@@ ons of ways that we can con@@ ne@@ ct to other people , and it seems to be univers@@ al ."
"T@@ w@@ o wee@@ ks ago , I just got back from P@@ ap@@ u@@ a New G@@ u@@ ine@@ a where I went up to the high@@ l@@ ands — very is@@ ol@@ ated tri@@ b@@ es of sub@@ sist@@ ence far@@ m@@ ers li@@ ving as they have li@@ ved for mil@@ l@@ en@@ ia ."
There are 8@@ 00 different langu@@ ag@@ es in the high@@ l@@ ands .
These are the most pri@@ mi@@ tive people in the world .
And they in@@ de@@ ed also rele@@ ase oxytocin .
So oxytocin connec@@ ts us to other people .
O@@ xy@@ tocin makes us feel what other people feel .
And it &apos;s so easy to cause people &apos;s bra@@ ins to rele@@ ase oxytocin .
"I know how to do it , and my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite way to do it is , in fact , the ea@@ si@@ est ."
Let me show it to you .
C@@ ome here . G@@ i@@ ve me a hu@@ g .
( Laughter ) There you go .
( Applause ) So my p@@ en@@ ch@@ ant for hu@@ g@@ g@@ ing other people has ear@@ ned me the n@@ ic@@ k@@ na@@ me D@@ r@@ . L@@ ove .
"I &apos;m happy to share a little more love in the world , it &apos;s great , but here &apos;s your pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tion from D@@ r@@ . L@@ ove : eight hu@@ gs a day ."
We have found that people who rele@@ ase more oxytocin are happ@@ i@@ er .
And they &apos;re happ@@ i@@ er because they have better relation@@ shi@@ ps of all t@@ yp@@ es .
D@@ r@@ . L@@ ove says eight hu@@ gs a day .
E@@ ight hu@@ gs a day — you &apos;ll be happ@@ i@@ er and the world will be a better place .
"O@@ f course , if you don &apos;t like to tou@@ ch people , I can always sho@@ ve this up your n@@ ose ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
"When I was n@@ ine years old , I went off to su@@ mm@@ er ca@@ m@@ p for the first time ."
C@@ am@@ p was more like a ke@@ g par@@ ty without any al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l .
And I just wa@@ ited for the time that I could go off and read my b@@ oo@@ ks .
It &apos;s different from being sh@@ y .
S@@ hy@@ ness is about fe@@ ar of social j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ment .
"We s@@ at in ro@@ ws of de@@ s@@ ks like this , and we did most of our work pretty au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ously ."
"So , quite underst@@ and@@ ably , qu@@ ali@@ ties like magne@@ tis@@ m and char@@ is@@ m@@ a su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly come to seem really important ."
So now I &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my su@@ it@@ case today .
It &apos;s great for int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ts and it &apos;s great for ex@@ t@@ ro@@ ver@@ ts .
"H@@ i , my na@@ me is M@@ ar@@ cin — far@@ m@@ er , techno@@ logi@@ st ."
"I was born in P@@ ol@@ and , now in the U.S@@ ."
I started a group called O@@ p@@ en S@@ our@@ ce E@@ co@@ logy .
"We &apos;ve i@@ d@@ enti@@ fied the 50 most important mach@@ ines that we think it ta@@ kes for modern life to ex@@ ist — things from tr@@ ac@@ tors , b@@ read o@@ v@@ ens , cir@@ cu@@ it ma@@ k@@ ers ."
"Th@@ en we set out to create an op@@ en sour@@ ce , D@@ I@@ Y , do it yourself ver@@ sion that any@@ one can build and ma@@ in@@ tain at a fr@@ action of the cost ."
We call this the G@@ lob@@ al V@@ il@@ la@@ ge Con@@ struc@@ tion S@@ et .
So let me tell you a story .
"So I fin@@ i@@ shed my 20@@ s with a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . in fu@@ sion energy , and I disco@@ ver@@ ed I was us@@ el@@ ess ."
I had no pr@@ ac@@ tical sk@@ il@@ ls .
"The world pre@@ sen@@ ted me with op@@ tions , and I took them ."
I gu@@ ess you can call it the con@@ su@@ m@@ er li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le .
So I started a far@@ m in M@@ is@@ sour@@ i and learned about the econom@@ ic@@ s of far@@ m@@ ing .
I b@@ ought a tr@@ ac@@ tor — then it bro@@ ke .
I pa@@ id to get it re@@ pa@@ i@@ red — then it bro@@ ke again .
"Th@@ en pretty so@@ on , I was bro@@ ke too ."
"I re@@ alized that the tru@@ ly appro@@ pri@@ ate , lo@@ w@@ -@@ cost to@@ ols that I needed to start a su@@ sta@@ in@@ able far@@ m and se@@ tt@@ le@@ ment just didn &apos;t ex@@ ist yet ."
"I needed to@@ ols that were ro@@ b@@ ust , mo@@ d@@ ular , high@@ ly e@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent and op@@ ti@@ mi@@ z@@ ed , lo@@ w@@ -@@ cost , made from lo@@ cal and rec@@ y@@ c@@ led materi@@ als that would last a li@@ fe@@ time , not de@@ sign@@ ed for ob@@ so@@ le@@ sc@@ ence ."
I found that I would have to build them my@@ self .
So I did just that .
And I test@@ ed them .
And I found that in@@ du@@ stri@@ al produc@@ ti@@ vity can be achi@@ ev@@ ed on a small sc@@ ale .
"So then I published the 3@@ D de@@ sign@@ s , sch@@ e@@ ma@@ tics , in@@ struc@@ tional vi@@ de@@ os and bu@@ d@@ gets on a wi@@ k@@ i ."
"Th@@ en con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tors from all over the world beg@@ an sho@@ wing up , pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ ing new mach@@ ines d@@ uring de@@ di@@ ca@@ ted pro@@ ject vi@@ s@@ its ."
"So far , we have pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ ed eight of the 50 mach@@ ines ."
And now the pro@@ ject is beginning to grow on its own .
We know that op@@ en sour@@ ce has su@@ c@@ ce@@ eded with to@@ ols for man@@ ag@@ ing kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and cre@@ ati@@ vity .
And the same is star@@ ting to happen with har@@ d@@ w@@ are too .
We &apos;re fo@@ c@@ using on har@@ d@@ w@@ are because it is har@@ d@@ w@@ are that can change people &apos;s lives in such t@@ an@@ gi@@ ble material ways .
"If we can lo@@ wer the b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers to far@@ m@@ ing , buil@@ ding , man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , then we can un@@ le@@ as@@ h just ma@@ s@@ sive amoun@@ ts of human p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al ."
That &apos;s not only in the develop@@ ing world .
"O@@ ur to@@ ols are being made for the American far@@ m@@ er , buil@@ der , ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur , ma@@ ker ."
"We &apos;ve se@@ en lots of exc@@ it@@ ement from these people , who can now start a con@@ struc@@ tion b@@ usiness , parts man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , organ@@ ic C@@ S@@ A or just sel@@ ling power back to the g@@ ri@@ d ."
"O@@ ur go@@ al is a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of published de@@ sign@@ s so c@@ lear , so comple@@ te , that a single bur@@ ned D@@ V@@ D is effec@@ tively a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation star@@ ter k@@ it ."
I &apos;ve plan@@ ted a hundred tre@@ es in a day .
"I &apos;ve press@@ ed 5@@ ,000 bri@@ c@@ ks in one day from the di@@ r@@ t bene@@ ath my fe@@ et and built a tr@@ ac@@ tor in six da@@ ys ."
"F@@ rom what I &apos;ve se@@ en , this is only the beginning ."
"If this idea is tru@@ ly sound , then the imp@@ lica@@ tions are sign@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant ."
"A gre@@ ater dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of the means of produc@@ tion , environ@@ m@@ ent@@ ally sound supp@@ ly c@@ ha@@ ins , and a ne@@ w@@ ly rele@@ v@@ ant D@@ I@@ Y ma@@ ker culture can hop@@ e to tr@@ an@@ sc@@ end arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ity ."
We &apos;re expl@@ or@@ ing the lim@@ its of what we all can do to make a better world with op@@ en har@@ d@@ w@@ are technology .

"A thous@@ and years later , a ma@@ mm@@ ot@@ h di@@ ed in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n G@@ er@@ many ."
"A few cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es after that , a g@@ ri@@ ff@@ on v@@ ul@@ ture also di@@ ed in the same vic@@ in@@ ity ."
"And we know almost nothing about how these an@@ im@@ als me@@ t their de@@ a@@ ths , but these different cre@@ atures dis@@ per@@ sed across both time and space did share one re@@ mark@@ able f@@ ate ."
Th@@ ink about that for a second .
"It seems pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous that you would inv@@ ent the flu@@ te , a too@@ l that cre@@ ated us@@ el@@ ess vi@@ bra@@ tions in air mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es ."
But that is ex@@ actly what our an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors did .
Now this turns out to be surpri@@ sing@@ ly common in the history of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation .
"But just as o@@ f@@ ten , new ideas come into the world simply because they &apos;re fu@@ n ."
T@@ a@@ ke what may be the most important inv@@ en@@ tion of modern times : progra@@ mm@@ able compu@@ ters .
"S@@ ome@@ one came up with the bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant idea of tri@@ g@@ g@@ ering s@@ oun@@ ds by press@@ ing small le@@ ver@@ s with our fin@@ g@@ ers , inv@@ ent@@ ing the first mu@@ sical ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard ."
"In fact , the very first t@@ y@@ pe@@ wr@@ it@@ er was ori@@ g@@ in@@ ally called &quot; &quot; the wr@@ iting har@@ p@@ si@@ ch@@ or@@ d . &quot; &quot; F@@ lu@@ tes and music led to even more po@@ wer@@ ful brea@@ k@@ thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ s ."
"A@@ b@@ out a thous@@ and years ago , at the he@@ ight of the I@@ s@@ la@@ mic R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance , three bro@@ thers in B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad de@@ sign@@ ed a de@@ v@@ ice that was an au@@ tom@@ ated org@@ an ."
"They called it &quot; &quot; the in@@ str@@ ument that p@@ la@@ ys itself . &quot; &quot; Now , the in@@ str@@ ument was ba@@ sically a gi@@ ant music bo@@ x ."
This in@@ str@@ ument was the first of its kind .
It was progra@@ mm@@ able .
"Now , con@@ cep@@ tually , this was a ma@@ s@@ sive lea@@ p for@@ ward ."
The whole idea of har@@ d@@ w@@ are and so@@ f@@ tw@@ are be@@ comes thin@@ k@@ able for the first time with this inv@@ en@@ tion .
It came from the stran@@ ge de@@ light of wat@@ ching a mach@@ ine pl@@ ay music .
"In fact , the idea of progra@@ mm@@ able mach@@ ines was ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely ke@@ p@@ t ali@@ ve by music for about 7@@ 00 years ."
"In the 1@@ 7@@ 00@@ s , mu@@ sic@@ -@@ making mach@@ ines be@@ came the play@@ things of the P@@ ari@@ si@@ an e@@ li@@ te ."
"And as de V@@ a@@ uc@@ an@@ son was de@@ sign@@ ing his ro@@ bo@@ t mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an , he had another idea ."
"If you could progra@@ m a mach@@ ine to make ple@@ as@@ ing s@@ oun@@ ds , why not progra@@ m it to we@@ a@@ ve de@@ li@@ ght@@ ful patter@@ ns of col@@ or out of cl@@ ot@@ h ?"
"If you wanted a new patter@@ n for your f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , you just progra@@ mm@@ ed a new c@@ y@@ l@@ in@@ der ."
This was the first progra@@ mm@@ able loo@@ m .
So ask yourself this question : what really made the modern computer possible ?
"@@ Y@@ es , the mi@@ lit@@ ary inv@@ ol@@ ve@@ ment is an important part of the story , but inv@@ ent@@ ing a computer also re@@ qui@@ red other buil@@ ding b@@ loc@@ ks : music bo@@ x@@ es , to@@ y ro@@ bo@@ t flu@@ te play@@ ers , har@@ p@@ si@@ ch@@ or@@ d ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , col@@ or@@ ful patter@@ ns w@@ o@@ ven into f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , and that &apos;s just a small part of the story ."
N@@ ec@@ ess@@ ity isn &apos;t always the mother of inv@@ en@@ tion .
"The play@@ ful state of mind is f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ ally expl@@ or@@ at@@ ory , see@@ king out new pos@@ sibi@@ li@@ ties in the world around us ."
And that see@@ king is why so many experienc@@ es that started with simple de@@ light and am@@ u@@ se@@ ment even@@ tually led us to pro@@ found brea@@ k@@ thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ s .
E@@ very@@ one ne@@ e@@ ds a co@@ ach .
"It doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a bas@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ all play@@ er , a ten@@ n@@ is play@@ er , a g@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ st or a bri@@ dge play@@ er ."
We all need people who will give us fe@@ ed@@ back .
That &apos;s how we impro@@ ve .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately , there &apos;s one group of people who get almost no syste@@ ma@@ tic fe@@ ed@@ back to help them do their j@@ ob@@ s better , and these people have one of the most important j@@ ob@@ s in the world ."
I &apos;m talking about teachers .
"When M@@ el@@ in@@ d@@ a and I learned how little u@@ se@@ ful fe@@ ed@@ back most teachers get , we were b@@ lo@@ wn away ."
"@@ Un@@ til rec@@ ently , over 9@@ 8 percent of teachers just got one word of fe@@ ed@@ back : S@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ t@@ ory ."
"If all my bri@@ dge co@@ ach ever told me was that I was &quot; &quot; sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ t@@ ory , &quot; &quot; I would have no hop@@ e of ever getting better ."
How would I know who was the best ?
How would I know what I was doing differ@@ ently ?
"T@@ o@@ day , dist@@ ri@@ c@@ ts are re@@ va@@ mp@@ ing the way they ev@@ alu@@ ate teachers , but we still give them almost no fe@@ ed@@ back that actually hel@@ ps them impro@@ ve their pr@@ ac@@ tice ."
O@@ ur teachers de@@ ser@@ ve better .
The system we have today isn &apos;t fa@@ ir to them .
"It &apos;s not fa@@ ir to students , and it &apos;s pu@@ tting America &apos;s global lead@@ er@@ ship at ri@@ s@@ k ."
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the to@@ ols for impro@@ ve@@ ment they want and de@@ ser@@ ve .
Let &apos;s start by asking who &apos;s doing well .
"Well , un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately there &apos;s no inter@@ national ran@@ king t@@ ab@@ les for teacher fe@@ ed@@ back syste@@ ms ."
Con@@ si@@ der the ran@@ k@@ ings for read@@ ing prof@@ ici@@ enc@@ y .
The U.S@@ . isn &apos;t number one .
We &apos;re not even in the top 10 .
We &apos;re ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th with I@@ c@@ el@@ and and P@@ ol@@ and .
"Now , out of all the pl@@ ac@@ es that do better than the U.S@@ . in read@@ ing , how many of them have a form@@ al system for hel@@ p@@ ing teachers impro@@ ve ?"
E@@ le@@ ven out of 14 .
"The U.S@@ . is ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th in read@@ ing , but we &apos;re 2@@ 3@@ r@@ d in science and 3@@ 1@@ st in mat@@ h ."
"So there &apos;s really only one are@@ a where we &apos;re ne@@ ar the top , and that &apos;s in fa@@ il@@ ing to give our teachers the help they need to devel@@ o@@ p their sk@@ il@@ ls ."
"@@ Let &apos;s look at the best a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic per@@ form@@ er : the pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce of S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i , China ."
"Now , they r@@ ank number one across the bo@@ ard , in read@@ ing , mat@@ h and science , and one of the ke@@ ys to S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i &apos;s incredi@@ ble success is the way they help teachers keep impro@@ ving ."
They made s@@ ure that youn@@ ger teachers get a chan@@ ce to wat@@ ch ma@@ ster teachers at work .
"They have wee@@ kly study groups , where teachers get together and talk about what &apos;s wor@@ king ."
They even re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e each teacher to ob@@ ser@@ ve and give fe@@ ed@@ back to their colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es .
"You might ask , why is a system like this so important ?"
It &apos;s because there &apos;s so much v@@ ari@@ ation in the teach@@ ing profes@@ sion .
S@@ ome teachers are far more effec@@ tive than others .
"In fact , there are teachers thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the country who are hel@@ p@@ ing their students make ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ga@@ ins ."
"If today &apos;s average teacher could become as good as those teachers , our students would be b@@ lo@@ wing away the rest of the world ."
So we need a system that hel@@ ps all our teachers be as good as the best .
What would that system look like ?
"Well , to find out , our f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation has been wor@@ king with 3@@ ,000 teachers in dist@@ ri@@ c@@ ts across the country on a pro@@ ject called M@@ e@@ as@@ ures of E@@ ffec@@ tive T@@ e@@ ach@@ ing ."
