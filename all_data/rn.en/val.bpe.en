"When I was 1@@ 1 , I re@@ memb@@ er wa@@ king up one mor@@ ning to the s@@ ound of jo@@ y in my h@@ ou@@ se ."
"M@@ y fa@@ ther was li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to B@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws on his small , gr@@ ay ra@@ di@@ o ."
"There was a big s@@ mi@@ le on his face which was un@@ us@@ u@@ al then , because the ne@@ ws m@@ os@@ tly de@@ pres@@ s@@ ed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are g@@ one ! &quot; &quot; my fa@@ ther sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my fa@@ ther was very , very happ@@ y ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was si@@ x when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over Af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an and made it il@@ le@@ g@@ al for g@@ ir@@ l@@ s to go to school ."
"So for the next fi@@ ve years , I dre@@ ss@@ ed as a bo@@ y to es@@ c@@ ort my ol@@ der si@@ ster , who was no l@@ on@@ ger al@@ low@@ ed to be out@@ side al@@ one , to a sec@@ re@@ t school ."
It was the only way we bot@@ h could be e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different r@@ ou@@ te so that no one would s@@ us@@ p@@ ect where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our bo@@ o@@ ks in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would see@@ m we were just out sh@@ opp@@ ing .
"The school was in a h@@ ou@@ se , more than 10@@ 0 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small li@@ ving room ."
It was co@@ z@@ y in w@@ in@@ ter but ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly ho@@ t in su@@ mm@@ er .
"We all k@@ new we were ri@@ s@@ king our li@@ ves — the te@@ ac@@ her , the stu@@ d@@ ents and our par@@ ents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly be can@@ c@@ el@@ ed for a we@@ e@@ k because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were s@@ us@@ pic@@ i@@ ous ."
We always w@@ on@@ der@@ ed what they k@@ new about us .
W@@ ere we being f@@ ol@@ low@@ ed ?
D@@ o they know where we live ?
"We were sc@@ ar@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to gro@@ w up in a fami@@ ly where e@@ du@@ cation was pri@@ z@@ ed and d@@ augh@@ ters were tre@@ as@@ u@@ red .
M@@ y gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther was an ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary man for his time .
"@@ A t@@ ot@@ al ma@@ ver@@ ic@@ k from a re@@ m@@ ot@@ e pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce of Af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an , he in@@ si@@ st@@ ed that his d@@ aughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was di@@ so@@ w@@ ned by his fa@@ ther ."
But my e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted mo@@ ther be@@ came a te@@ ac@@ her .
There she is .
"S@@ he re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to tur@@ n our h@@ ou@@ se into a school for g@@ ir@@ l@@ s and women in our ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood ."
And my fa@@ ther — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his fami@@ ly to re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve an e@@ du@@ cation .
"There was no question that his children would re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve an e@@ du@@ cation , in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding his d@@ augh@@ ters , des@@ p@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , des@@ p@@ ite the ri@@ s@@ ks ."
"T@@ o him , there was gre@@ ater ri@@ s@@ k in not e@@ du@@ ca@@ ting his children ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years , I re@@ memb@@ er there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated by our life and always being sc@@ ar@@ ed and not see@@ ing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my fa@@ ther , he would say , &quot; &quot; Li@@ st@@ en , my d@@ aughter , you can l@@ ose everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be for@@ c@@ ed to lea@@ ve your home d@@ ur@@ ing a w@@ ar .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to s@@ ell our b@@ loo@@ d to p@@ ay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to cont@@ in@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; To@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in a country that has been de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed by de@@ ca@@ des of w@@ ar .
"F@@ ew@@ er than si@@ x percent of women my age have made it be@@ y@@ on@@ d hi@@ gh school , and had my fami@@ ly not been so comm@@ it@@ ted to my e@@ du@@ cation , I would be one of them ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I st@@ and here a pr@@ ou@@ d gra@@ du@@ ate of Mi@@ dd@@ le@@ b@@ ur@@ y C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."

"H@@ e not only bra@@ gs about my col@@ le@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e , but also that I was the first wom@@ an , and that I am the first wom@@ an to dri@@ ve him through the st@@ re@@ e@@ ts of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l ."
( Applause ) M@@ y fami@@ ly beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my fami@@ ly dre@@ am@@ s even bi@@ gg@@ er for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a g@@ lob@@ al am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a g@@ lob@@ al ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n to e@@ du@@ ca@@ te women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and per@@ h@@ ap@@ s only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for g@@ ir@@ l@@ s in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an , a country where it &apos;s still ri@@ sk@@ y for g@@ ir@@ l@@ s to go to school ."
The ex@@ c@@ iting thing is that I see stu@@ d@@ ents at my school with am@@ bi@@ tion gr@@ ab@@ b@@ ing at opp@@ ort@@ unity .
"And I see their par@@ ents and their fa@@ th@@ ers who , like my own , ad@@ vo@@ ca@@ te for them , des@@ p@@ ite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ pos@@ i@@ tion ."
"L@@ i@@ ke Ah@@ m@@ ed . That &apos;s not his real na@@ me , and I can@@ not show you his face , but Ah@@ m@@ ed is the fa@@ ther of one of my stu@@ d@@ ents ."
"L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his d@@ aughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their v@@ ill@@ age , and they lit@@ er@@ ally m@@ is@@ s@@ ed being k@@ ill@@ ed by a ro@@ ad@@ side b@@ om@@ b by min@@ ut@@ es ."

"@@ &quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my d@@ aughter &apos;s future because of your old and bac@@ k@@ w@@ ard ide@@ as . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to re@@ aliz@@ e about Af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an , and this is something that is of@@ ten di@@ sm@@ is@@ s@@ ed in the W@@ est , that be@@ h@@ ind most of us who s@@ uc@@ ce@@ ed is a fa@@ ther who re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ es the val@@ ue in his d@@ aughter and who se@@ es that her s@@ uc@@ cess is his s@@ uc@@ cess ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mo@@ th@@ ers ar@@ en &apos;t k@@ ey in our s@@ uc@@ cess .
"In fact , they &apos;re of@@ ten the in@@ i@@ ti@@ al and con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ing ne@@ go@@ ti@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their d@@ augh@@ ters , but in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a soci@@ e@@ ty like in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an , we m@@ ust have the su@@ pp@@ ort of m@@ en ."

"But today , more than three million g@@ ir@@ l@@ s are in school in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an ."
( Applause ) Af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an loo@@ ks so different from here in Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a .

I gre@@ w up in a very sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .

"When you &apos;re si@@ x , maybe you can do that ."
"I didn &apos;t want any@@ one to know that I was a g@@ ir@@ l , and they didn &apos;t ."
I ke@@ p@@ t up the ch@@ ar@@ ad@@ e for ei@@ ght years .

"In fact , no one in my life k@@ new that I was a g@@ ir@@ l — not my te@@ ach@@ ers at school , not my fri@@ en@@ ds , not the di@@ rec@@ t@@ ors that I wor@@ ked with ."

It &apos;s wor@@ th m@@ en@@ tion@@ ing th@@ ough that I didn &apos;t h@@ ate my body or my gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a .

N@@ o one is ex@@ ac@@ tly sh@@ oc@@ ked .
( Laughter ) But I w@@ as@@ n &apos;t as@@ ked to de@@ f@@ ine my@@ self by my par@@ ents .
"When I was 1@@ 5 , and I called my fa@@ ther to tell him that I had f@@ all@@ en in love , it was the last thing on ei@@ ther of our min@@ ds to disc@@ us@@ s what the con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces were of the fact that my first love was a g@@ ir@@ l ."

I was not an ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st .

How could they say that we as a grou@@ p were not des@@ er@@ ving of e@@ qu@@ al ri@@ gh@@ ts as some@@ body el@@ se ?
W@@ ere we even a grou@@ p ? What grou@@ p ?
And had these people ever even con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ly me@@ t a v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of their disc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation ?
D@@ id they know who they were v@@ ot@@ ing aga@@ in@@ st and what the imp@@ act was ?
"And then it oc@@ cur@@ red to me , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s if they could look into the ey@@ es of the people that they were ca@@ st@@ ing into secon@@ d-@@ cl@@ as@@ s ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ shi@@ p it might make it h@@ ar@@ der for them to do ."
It might give them pa@@ use .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly I cou@@ ldn &apos;t get 2@@ 0 million people to the same d@@ in@@ n@@ er par@@ ty , so I fi@@ gu@@ red out a way where I could int@@ ro@@ du@@ ce them to each other ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ically with@@ out any ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ice , with@@ out any li@@ gh@@ ting , or with@@ out any man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ation of any kind on my part ."

"F@@ or me , ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y is not just about ex@@ pos@@ ing f@@ il@@ m , it &apos;s about ex@@ pos@@ ing the vi@@ ew@@ er to something new , a place they ha@@ ven &apos;t g@@ one before , but most import@@ an@@ tly , to people that they might be af@@ ra@@ id of ."

"I want to vi@@ s@@ it 2@@ 5 Am@@ eri@@ can ci@@ ties , and I want to sh@@ oo@@ t 4@@ ,000 or 5@@ ,000 people ."
This is my con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to the ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ gh@@ ts fi@@ ght of my gener@@ ation .

And a lot more people wanted to show their fac@@ es than I had an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated .
"So I chan@@ ged my im@@ medi@@ ate go@@ al to 10@@ ,000 fac@@ es ."
"That vi@@ de@@ o was made in the sp@@ r@@ ing of 20@@ 1@@ 1 , and as of today I have tra@@ vel@@ ed to al@@ most 2@@ 0 ci@@ ties and ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ed al@@ most 2@@ ,000 people ."
"I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a min@@ ut@@ e of just qu@@ i@@ et and have you just look at these fac@@ es because there is no@@ thing that I can say that will ad@@ d to them ."
"@@ Because if a pic@@ ture is wor@@ th a thou@@ s@@ and wor@@ ds , then a pic@@ ture of a face nee@@ ds a whole new vo@@ ca@@ b@@ ul@@ ary ."
"So after tra@@ vel@@ ing and tal@@ king to people in plac@@ es like Ok@@ la@@ h@@ om@@ a or sm@@ all@@ -@@ to@@ wn T@@ ex@@ as , we found e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence that the in@@ i@@ ti@@ al pre@@ mi@@ se was de@@ ad on ."
V@@ i@@ si@@ b@@ ility really is k@@ ey .

S@@ par@@ king e@@ mp@@ a@@ th@@ y had become the bac@@ k@@ b@@ one of S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ d@@ ent T@@ ru@@ ths .
But here &apos;s what I was star@@ ting to lear@@ n that was really interesting : S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ d@@ ent T@@ ru@@ ths doesn &apos;t er@@ ase the differ@@ en@@ ces between us .
"In fact , on the con@@ tr@@ ary , it high@@ li@@ gh@@ ts them ."
"It pres@@ ents , not just the comple@@ xi@@ ties found in a pro@@ c@@ es@@ sion of different human be@@ ings , but the comple@@ xi@@ ties found with@@ in each in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al person ."
"It w@@ as@@ n &apos;t that we had too many bo@@ x@@ es , it was that we had too few ."
"A@@ t some point I re@@ aliz@@ ed that my m@@ is@@ sion to ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h &quot; &quot; g@@ ays &quot; &quot; was in@@ h@@ er@@ ently f@@ la@@ w@@ ed , because there were a million different s@@ ha@@ des of g@@ ay ."
"H@@ ere I was trying to help , and I had per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated the very thing I had sp@@ ent my life trying to a@@ vo@@ id — ye@@ t another bo@@ x ."
A@@ t some point I ad@@ ded a question to the re@@ le@@ ase form that as@@ ked people to qu@@ an@@ ti@@ f@@ y the@@ m@@ selves on a sc@@ ale of one to 10@@ 0 percent g@@ ay .
And I w@@ at@@ ch@@ ed so many ex@@ i@@ st@@ enti@@ al cri@@ ses un@@ fo@@ ld in fr@@ on@@ t of me .
( Laughter ) Pe@@ ople didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been pres@@ en@@ ted with the op@@ tion before .
C@@ an you qu@@ an@@ ti@@ f@@ y your op@@ en@@ n@@ ess ?
"O@@ n@@ ce they got over the sh@@ oc@@ k , th@@ ough , by and lar@@ ge people op@@ ted for some@@ where between 7@@ 0 to 9@@ 5 percent or the 3 to 2@@ 0 percent mar@@ ks ."
"O@@ f course , there were l@@ ots of people who op@@ ted for a 10@@ 0 percent one or the other , but I found that a much lar@@ ger pro@@ p@@ or@@ tion of people id@@ enti@@ fi@@ ed as something that was much more nu@@ an@@ c@@ ed ."
I found that most people f@@ all on a spec@@ tr@@ um of what I have come to re@@ f@@ er to as &quot; &quot; G@@ re@@ y . &quot; &quot; L@@ et me be c@@ le@@ ar th@@ ough — and this is very important — in no way am I sa@@ ying that pre@@ f@@ er@@ ence doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
"And I am not even going to ad@@ dre@@ s@@ s the is@@ su@@ e of cho@@ ice ver@@ su@@ s bi@@ o@@ logi@@ cal im@@ per@@ a@@ tive , because if any of you happ@@ en to be of the beli@@ e@@ f that se@@ xu@@ al or@@ i@@ en@@ ta@@ tion is a cho@@ ice , I inv@@ ite you to go out and try to be gre@@ y ."
I &apos;ll take your pic@@ ture just for trying .
( Laughter ) What I am sa@@ ying th@@ ough is that human be@@ ings are not on@@ e-@@ di@@ m@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ al .
"The most important thing to take from the per@@ c@@ ent@@ age system is this : I@@ f you have g@@ ay people over here and you have st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght people over here , and wh@@ i@@ le we re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e that most people id@@ enti@@ f@@ y as some@@ where cl@@ os@@ er to one b@@ in@@ ary or another , there is this v@@ ast spec@@ tr@@ um of people that ex@@ ist in between ."
And the re@@ ality that this pres@@ ents is a comp@@ li@@ ca@@ ted one .
"@@ Because , for example , if you p@@ as@@ s a la@@ w that al@@ low@@ s a b@@ oss to fir@@ e an e@@ mp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e for h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or , where ex@@ ac@@ tly do you d@@ ra@@ w the line ?"
"I@@ s it over here , by the people who have had one or two he@@ ter@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al experi@@ en@@ ces so f@@ ar ?"
O@@ r is it over here by the people who have only had one or two h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al experi@@ en@@ ces th@@ us f@@ ar ?
W@@ here ex@@ ac@@ tly does one become a secon@@ d-@@ cl@@ as@@ s ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ?
A@@ no@@ ther interesting thing that I lear@@ ned from my proj@@ ect and my tra@@ vel@@ s is just what a po@@ or b@@ in@@ ding ag@@ ent se@@ xu@@ al or@@ i@@ en@@ ta@@ tion is .
"A@@ f@@ ter tra@@ vel@@ ing so much and me@@ e@@ ting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many j@@ er@@ ks and s@@ we@@ e@@ the@@ ar@@ ts and De@@ mo@@ cr@@ at@@ s and Re@@ publi@@ c@@ ans and jo@@ c@@ ks and qu@@ e@@ en@@ s and every other p@@ ol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation you can pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly think of with@@ in the L@@ G@@ B@@ T comm@@ unity as there are with@@ in the human r@@ ace ."
"A@@ side from the fact that we pl@@ ay with one le@@ g@@ al h@@ and ti@@ ed be@@ h@@ ind our bac@@ ks , and on@@ ce you get p@@ ast the sh@@ ar@@ ed n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive of pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce and str@@ u@@ gg@@ le , just being other than st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght doesn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly mean that we have any@@ thing in comm@@ on ."
"So in the end@@ less pro@@ li@@ f@@ er@@ ation of fac@@ es that S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ d@@ ent T@@ ru@@ ths is always be@@ coming , as it hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly ap@@ pe@@ ars ac@@ r@@ oss more and more pl@@ at@@ for@@ ms , b@@ us sh@@ el@@ ters , b@@ ill@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , F@@ ac@@ e@@ book p@@ ag@@ es , sc@@ re@@ en sa@@ ver@@ s , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s in w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing this pro@@ c@@ es@@ sion of hum@@ an@@ ity , something interesting and us@@ e@@ ful will be@@ g@@ in to happ@@ en ."
"H@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly these ca@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies , these b@@ in@@ ar@@ ies , these over@@ -@@ si@@ mp@@ li@@ fi@@ ed bo@@ x@@ es will be@@ g@@ in to become us@@ el@@ ess and they &apos;ll be@@ g@@ in to f@@ all away ."
"@@ Because really , they des@@ cri@@ be no@@ thing that we see and no one that we know and no@@ thing that we are ."
What we see are human be@@ ings in all their m@@ ul@@ ti@@ p@@ li@@ city .
And see@@ ing them ma@@ kes it h@@ ar@@ der to d@@ en@@ y their hum@@ an@@ ity .
A@@ t the very le@@ ast I hop@@ e it ma@@ kes it h@@ ar@@ der to d@@ en@@ y their human ri@@ gh@@ ts .
"So is it me par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly that you would cho@@ ose to d@@ en@@ y the right to h@@ ous@@ ing , the right to ad@@ op@@ t children , the right to mar@@ ri@@ age , the f@@ re@@ e@@ do@@ m to sh@@ op here , live here , bu@@ y here ?"
"A@@ m I the one that you cho@@ ose to di@@ so@@ wn as your chil@@ d or your b@@ ro@@ ther or your si@@ ster or your mo@@ ther or your fa@@ ther , your ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or , your cou@@ s@@ in , your un@@ c@@ le , the pre@@ si@@ d@@ ent , your poli@@ ce wom@@ an or the fi@@ re@@ man ?"
It &apos;s too l@@ ate .
Because I al@@ ready am all of those things .
"We al@@ ready are all of those things , and we always have been ."
"So p@@ le@@ ase don &apos;t gre@@ et us as str@@ an@@ g@@ ers , gre@@ et us as your f@@ el@@ low human be@@ ings , per@@ i@@ od ."

Th@@ ese piec@@ es d@@ ate back from the &apos; 40@@ s to the l@@ ate &apos; 50@@ s .

"In an age of g@@ lob@@ al stri@@ fe and cli@@ m@@ ate change , I &apos;m here to an@@ sw@@ er the all important question : Wh@@ y is se@@ x so d@@ am@@ n good ?"
"If you &apos;re l@@ augh@@ ing , you know what I mean ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s why . B@@ ack in uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , we had a qu@@ ic@@ k proj@@ ect to design some sol@@ ar@@ -@@ pow@@ er@@ ed c@@ lo@@ c@@ ks ."
H@@ ere &apos;s my c@@ lo@@ c@@ k .
"It us@@ es something called the d@@ war@@ f s@@ un@@ f@@ low@@ er , which gro@@ ws to about 1@@ 2 in@@ ch@@ es in he@@ i@@ ght ."
"Now , as you know , s@@ un@@ f@@ low@@ ers tr@@ ack the su@@ n d@@ ur@@ ing the course of the day ."
"So in the mor@@ ning , you see which di@@ rec@@ tion the s@@ un@@ f@@ low@@ er is fac@@ ing , and you mar@@ k it on the bl@@ ank are@@ a in the bas@@ e ."
"A@@ t no@@ on , you mar@@ k the chan@@ ged pos@@ i@@ tion of the s@@ un@@ f@@ low@@ er , and in the ev@@ en@@ ing again , and that &apos;s your c@@ lo@@ c@@ k ."
"Now , I know my c@@ lo@@ c@@ k doesn &apos;t tell you the ex@@ act time , but it does give you a gener@@ al idea using a f@@ low@@ er ."
"So , in my comple@@ tely un@@ bi@@ as@@ ed , su@@ bj@@ ec@@ tive op@@ in@@ i@@ on , it &apos;s b@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , here &apos;s Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ c@@ k ."
It &apos;s fi@@ ve ma@@ g@@ ni@@ f@@ ying gl@@ as@@ ses with a sh@@ o@@ t gl@@ as@@ s und@@ er each one .
I@@ n each sh@@ o@@ t gl@@ as@@ s is a different sc@@ en@@ ted o@@ il .

"This will war@@ m up the sc@@ en@@ ted o@@ il in@@ side , and a par@@ tic@@ ular sm@@ ell will be em@@ it@@ ted ."
"So d@@ ur@@ ing the course of the day , fi@@ ve different sm@@ ells are dis@@ per@@ s@@ ed thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out that en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment ."
An@@ y@@ one li@@ ving in that h@@ ou@@ se can tell the time just by the sm@@ ell .
You can see why I h@@ ate Ch@@ r@@ is .
On@@ e thing you have to know about me is I h@@ ate to l@@ ose .
This problem &apos;s been bu@@ gg@@ ing me for well over a de@@ ca@@ de .
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why se@@ x is so good ."
"M@@ any years after the sol@@ ar pow@@ er@@ ed c@@ lo@@ c@@ ks proj@@ ect , a y@@ oun@@ g l@@ ad@@ y I k@@ new su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ed maybe se@@ x is so good because of the fi@@ ve sen@@ ses ."
"And when she said this , I had an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any ."
So I deci@@ ded to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate different experi@@ en@@ ces I had in my life from the point of vi@@ e@@ w of the fi@@ ve sen@@ ses .
"T@@ o do this , I de@@ vi@@ s@@ ed something called the fi@@ ve sen@@ ses grap@@ h ."
"A@@ long the y-@@ ax@@ is , you have a sc@@ ale from z@@ er@@ o to 10 , and al@@ ong the x-@@ ax@@ is , you have , of course , the fi@@ ve sen@@ ses ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ time I had a me@@ mor@@ able experi@@ ence in my life , I would rec@@ or@@ d it on this grap@@ h like a fi@@ ve sen@@ ses di@@ ary ."
H@@ ere &apos;s a qu@@ ic@@ k vi@@ de@@ o to show you how it wor@@ ks .
"B@@ i@@ ke desig@@ n@@ er : This is &#9@@ 1@@ ; un@@ c@@ le@@ ar &#9@@ 3@@ ; , cu@@ st@@ om bi@@ ke desig@@ n@@ er ."
( M@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ le re@@ v@@ ving ) &#9@@ 1@@ ; S@@ ound &#9@@ 3@@ ; &#9@@ 1@@ ; T@@ ou@@ ch &#9@@ 3@@ ; &#9@@ 1@@ ; Si@@ ght &#9@@ 3@@ ; &#9@@ 1@@ ; S@@ m@@ ell &#9@@ 3@@ ; &#9@@ 1@@ ; Ta@@ st@@ e &#9@@ 3@@ ; J@@ L : And that &apos;s how the fi@@ ve sen@@ ses grap@@ h wor@@ ks .
So here are some other res@@ ul@@ ts .
The first is for in@@ st@@ ant no@@ o@@ dl@@ es .
"Now ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly , ta@@ st@@ e and sm@@ ell are quite hi@@ gh , but no@@ ti@@ ce s@@ ound is at three ."
"You know . ( Sl@@ ur@@ ps ) Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , I no l@@ on@@ ger d@@ ine with these people ."
"O@@ K , next , cl@@ u@@ bb@@ ing ."
Th@@ ese people I still do h@@ an@@ g out with .
"A@@ ll right , and s@@ mo@@ king ."
"H@@ ere I found t@@ ou@@ ch is at &#9@@ 1@@ ; si@@ x &#9@@ 3@@ ; , and one of the reas@@ ons is that s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers to@@ ld me the sen@@ sa@@ tion of h@@ ol@@ ding a ci@@ g@@ ar@@ et@@ te and br@@ ing@@ ing it up to your li@@ ps is a big part of the s@@ mo@@ king experi@@ ence , which show@@ s , it &apos;s kind of sc@@ ary to think how well ci@@ g@@ ar@@ et@@ t@@ es are desig@@ ned by the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers ."
"O@@ K . Now , what would the per@@ f@@ ect experi@@ ence look like on the fi@@ ve sen@@ ses grap@@ h ?"
"It would , of course , be a h@@ or@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ al line al@@ ong the to@@ p ."
"Now you can see , not even as in@@ ten@@ se an experi@@ ence as ri@@ ding a m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke comes cl@@ ose ."
"In fact , in the years that I ga@@ ther@@ ed data , only one experi@@ ence came cl@@ ose to being the per@@ f@@ ect one ."
"That is , of course , se@@ x . G@@ re@@ at se@@ x ."
R@@ es@@ p@@ on@@ d@@ ents said that great se@@ x h@@ its all of the fi@@ ve sen@@ ses at an ex@@ tre@@ me le@@ vel .
So the fi@@ ve sen@@ ses the@@ ory does help ex@@ pla@@ in why se@@ x is so good .
"Now in the mi@@ dd@@ le of all this fi@@ ve sen@@ ses work , I su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly re@@ memb@@ er@@ ed the sol@@ ar@@ -@@ pow@@ er@@ ed c@@ lo@@ c@@ ks proj@@ ect from my y@@ ou@@ th ."
And I re@@ aliz@@ ed this the@@ ory also ex@@ pla@@ ins why Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ c@@ k is so much better than m@@ ine .
"You see , my c@@ lo@@ c@@ k only fo@@ c@@ us@@ es on si@@ ght , and a little bit of t@@ ou@@ ch ."
H@@ ere &apos;s Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ c@@ k .
It &apos;s the first c@@ lo@@ c@@ k ever that us@@ es sm@@ ell to tell the time .
"In fact , in ter@@ ms of the fi@@ ve sen@@ ses , Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ c@@ k is a re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution ."
And that &apos;s what this the@@ ory ta@@ u@@ ght me about my fi@@ el@@ d .
"You see , up ti@@ ll now , us desig@@ n@@ ers , we &apos;ve ma@@ in@@ ly fo@@ c@@ used on making things look very pret@@ ty , and a little bit of t@@ ou@@ ch , which means we &apos;ve ig@@ no@@ red the other three sen@@ ses ."
Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s c@@ lo@@ c@@ k show@@ s us that even ra@@ is@@ ing just one of those other sen@@ ses can make for a b@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant produc@@ t .
So what if we started using the fi@@ ve sen@@ ses the@@ ory in all of our desig@@ ns ?
H@@ ere &apos;s three qu@@ ic@@ k ide@@ as I came up with .
"We could call this &quot; &quot; the per@@ fu@@ mat@@ or . &quot; &quot; A@@ ll right , next ."
"So I br@@ us@@ h my te@@ e@@ th tw@@ ice a day , and what if we had a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h that ta@@ st@@ es like can@@ dy , and when the ta@@ st@@ e of can@@ dy r@@ an out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h ?"
"F@@ in@@ ally , I have a thing for the ke@@ ys on a fl@@ ut@@ e or a cl@@ ar@@ in@@ et ."
"It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you pres@@ s down on them ."
"Now , I don &apos;t pl@@ ay the fl@@ ut@@ e or the cl@@ ar@@ in@@ et , so I deci@@ ded to com@@ b@@ ine these ke@@ ys with an in@@ str@@ um@@ ent I do pl@@ ay : the t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion re@@ m@@ ot@@ e cont@@ ro@@ l ."
"Now , when we look at these three ide@@ as together , you &apos;ll no@@ ti@@ ce that the fi@@ ve sen@@ ses the@@ ory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these produc@@ ts but also the way they look ."
"Now , I re@@ aliz@@ e the fi@@ ve sen@@ ses is@@ n &apos;t the only thing that ma@@ kes life interesting ."
There &apos;s also the si@@ x e@@ mo@@ tions and that el@@ us@@ i@@ ve x-@@ fac@@ t@@ or .
M@@ ay@@ be that could be the t@@ op@@ ic of my next talk .
"@@ Un@@ ti@@ l then , p@@ le@@ ase have fu@@ n using the fi@@ ve sen@@ ses in your own li@@ ves and your own desig@@ ns ."
"O@@ h , one last thing before I lea@@ ve ."
And the best way to do that is with f@@ ree can@@ dy .
You gu@@ ys ready ?
A@@ ll right .

"When I was si@@ x years old , I re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved my gi@@ f@@ ts ."
M@@ y first gra@@ de te@@ ac@@ her had this b@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant idea .

What could go wr@@ ong ?
"And then there were 2@@ 0 people left , and 10 people left , and fi@@ ve left ..@@ ."
and three left .
And I was one of them .
And the comp@@ li@@ m@@ ents st@@ opp@@ ed .
"Well , at that mom@@ ent , I was cr@@ ying ."
And the te@@ ac@@ her was f@@ re@@ a@@ king out .
But I don &apos;t know who f@@ el@@ t wor@@ se that day .
S@@ he m@@ ust have re@@ aliz@@ ed that she tur@@ ned a te@@ am@@ -@@ buil@@ ding ev@@ ent into a publi@@ c ro@@ ast for three si@@ x-@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ ol@@ ds .
That &apos;s one ver@@ sion .
Th@@ en fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ w@@ ard ei@@ ght years .
"B@@ ill G@@ ates came to my h@@ om@@ e@@ to@@ wn — Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing , Ch@@ in@@ a — to spe@@ a@@ k , and I sa@@ w his m@@ ess@@ age ."
I f@@ ell in love with that gu@@ y .
"I thought , w@@ ow , I know what I want to do now ."
"And here it is — ( Laughter ) You don &apos;t have to re@@ ad this through — ( Laughter ) This is also b@@ ad h@@ and@@ wr@@ iting , but I did high@@ light some k@@ ey wor@@ ds ."
You get the idea .
( Laughter ) So ..@@ .
that was another ver@@ sion of me : one who will con@@ qu@@ er the world .
"I ju@@ mp@@ ed on it , because that was where B@@ ill G@@ ates li@@ ved , right ?"
( Laughter ) I thought that was the start of my ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eu@@ r j@@ our@@ ne@@ y .
"Th@@ en , fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ w@@ ard another 1@@ 4 years ."
I was 3@@ 0 .
"N@@ op@@ e , I didn &apos;t buil@@ d that comp@@ any ."
I didn &apos;t even start .
I was actually a mar@@ ke@@ ting man@@ ag@@ er for a F@@ ort@@ un@@ e 50@@ 0 comp@@ any .
Wh@@ y is that ?
W@@ here is that 14@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old who wr@@ ot@@ e that le@@ tter ?
It &apos;s not because he didn &apos;t try .
On@@ e wanted to con@@ qu@@ er the world — make a differ@@ ence — another was af@@ ra@@ id of re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion .
And every time that si@@ x-@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old w@@ on .
And this fe@@ ar even per@@ si@@ st@@ ed after I started my own comp@@ any .
"I mean , I started my own comp@@ any when I was 3@@ 0 — if you want to be B@@ ill G@@ ates , you &apos;ve got to start so@@ on@@ er or l@@ ater , right ?"
"When I was an ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eu@@ r , I was pres@@ en@@ ted with an in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment opp@@ ort@@ unity , and then I was tur@@ ned down ."
And that re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion h@@ ur@@ t me .
It h@@ ur@@ t me so b@@ ad that I wanted to qu@@ it right there .
"But then I thought , he@@ y , would B@@ ill G@@ ates qu@@ it after a si@@ mple in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion ?"
W@@ ould any s@@ uc@@ c@@ ess@@ ful ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eu@@ r qu@@ it like that ?
N@@ o way .
And this is where it cli@@ c@@ ked for me .
"O@@ K , I can buil@@ d a better comp@@ any ."
"I can buil@@ d a better te@@ am or better produc@@ t , but one thing for s@@ ure : I &apos;ve got to be a better le@@ ad@@ er ."
I can@@ not let that si@@ x-@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old ke@@ ep di@@ ct@@ ating my life any@@ more .
G@@ oo@@ g@@ le was my fri@@ end .
( Laughter ) But why was I still so sc@@ ar@@ ed ?
It &apos;s called re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion@@ ther@@ ap@@ y@@ .@@ com@@ .
H@@ is na@@ me is J@@ as@@ on C@@ om@@ ely .
And I lo@@ ved that idea .
And so here &apos;s what I did .
This is what the b@@ lo@@ g loo@@ ked like .
D@@ ay On@@ e ..@@ .
( Laughter ) B@@ or@@ ro@@ w 10@@ 0 doll@@ ars from a str@@ an@@ ger .
So this is where I went to where I was working .

He loo@@ ked like a sec@@ ur@@ ity gu@@ ard .

"But because I f@@ il@@ m@@ ed my@@ self — so that ni@@ ght I was w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing my@@ self getting re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted , I just sa@@ w how sc@@ ar@@ ed I was ."
I loo@@ ked like this k@@ id in &quot; &quot; The Si@@ x@@ th S@@ en@@ se . &quot; &quot; I sa@@ w de@@ ad people .
"You know , he w@@ as@@ n &apos;t that m@@ en@@ ac@@ ing ."
And I could &apos;ve said many things .
"I could &apos;ve ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed , I could &apos;ve ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ated ."
I didn &apos;t do any of that .
"I f@@ el@@ t , w@@ ow , this is like a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ c@@ os@@ m of my life ."
And you know what ?
"The next day , no mat@@ ter what happen@@ s , I &apos;m not going to ru@@ n ."
I &apos;ll st@@ ay en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed .
"And by the way , I don &apos;t think they &apos;ve ever done b@@ ur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill ."
( Laughter ) I think they &apos;re still there .
"But the life and de@@ ath fe@@ el@@ ing I was fe@@ el@@ ing the first time was no l@@ on@@ ger there , just because I st@@ ay@@ ed en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed — because I didn &apos;t ru@@ n ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , great , I &apos;m al@@ ready lear@@ ning things ."
G@@ re@@ at . &quot; &quot; And then D@@ ay Th@@ ree : G@@ et@@ ting Ol@@ y@@ mp@@ ic D@@ ou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts .
I went to a K@@ ri@@ sp@@ y K@@ re@@ me .
It &apos;s a d@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut sh@@ op in ma@@ in@@ ly the S@@ ou@@ the@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n part of the Un@@ ited St@@ ates .
"I &apos;m s@@ ure they have some here , too ."
"And I went in , I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you make me d@@ ou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts that look like Ol@@ y@@ mp@@ ic sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ s ?"
"B@@ as@@ ically , you inter@@ l@@ in@@ k fi@@ ve d@@ ou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts together ..@@ . &quot; &quot; I mean there &apos;s no way they could say y@@ es , right ?"
The d@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut ma@@ k@@ er took me so s@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly .
"( Laughter ) So she put out p@@ ap@@ er , started j@@ ot@@ ting down the col@@ ors and the r@@ ings , and is like , &quot; &quot; How can I make this ? &quot; &quot; And then 1@@ 5 min@@ ut@@ es l@@ ater , she came out with a bo@@ x that loo@@ ked like Ol@@ y@@ mp@@ ic r@@ ings ."
And I was so t@@ ou@@ ch@@ ed .
I just cou@@ ldn &apos;t believe it .
And that vi@@ de@@ o got over fi@@ ve million vi@@ e@@ ws on Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be .
The world cou@@ ldn &apos;t believe that ei@@ ther .
"@@ A lot of people started wr@@ iting e@@ ma@@ il@@ s to me and sa@@ ying , &quot; &quot; What you &apos;re doing is aw@@ es@@ ome . &quot; &quot; But you know , fa@@ me and n@@ ot@@ or@@ i@@ e@@ ty did not do any@@ thing to me ."
"Wh@@ at I really wanted to do was lear@@ n , and to change my@@ self ."
So I tur@@ ned the re@@ st of my 10@@ 0 d@@ ays of re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion into this pl@@ ay@@ gr@@ ound — into this re@@ sear@@ ch proj@@ ect .
I wanted to see what I could lear@@ n .
And then I lear@@ ned a lot of things .
I disc@@ over@@ ed so many sec@@ re@@ ts .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , I have this do@@ g that would di@@ g up any@@ thing I put in the bac@@ k@@ y@@ ard ."
"If you want to do this , go ac@@ r@@ oss the st@@ re@@ et and talk to C@@ on@@ ni@@ e ."
S@@ he lo@@ ves f@@ low@@ ers . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
I went ac@@ r@@ oss and kno@@ c@@ ked on C@@ on@@ ni@@ e &apos;s do@@ or .
And she was so happ@@ y to see me .
I &apos;m s@@ ure it loo@@ ks better now .
It was n@@ one of those .
It was because what I off@@ er@@ ed did not f@@ it what he wanted .
"And he tr@@ u@@ st@@ ed me enough to off@@ er me a re@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ al , using a s@@ al@@ es ter@@ m ."
I con@@ ver@@ ted a re@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ al .
"So for example , one day I went to a St@@ ar@@ b@@ uc@@ ks , and as@@ ked the man@@ ag@@ er , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , can I be a St@@ ar@@ b@@ uc@@ ks gre@@ e@@ ter ? &quot; &quot; He was like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a St@@ ar@@ b@@ uc@@ ks gre@@ e@@ ter ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o you know those W@@ al@@ mar@@ t gre@@ e@@ ters ?"
"You know , those people who say &apos; h@@ i &apos; to you before you wal@@ k in the st@@ ore , and make s@@ ure you don &apos;t ste@@ al stu@@ ff , bas@@ ically ?"
It &apos;s as if he &apos;s p@@ ut@@ ting all the d@@ ou@@ b@@ t on the f@@ lo@@ or .
"I said &quot; &quot; h@@ i &quot; &quot; to every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er that wal@@ ked in , and ga@@ ve them ho@@ li@@ day ch@@ e@@ ers ."
"B@@ y the way , I don &apos;t know what your car@@ e@@ er tra@@ j@@ ec@@ t@@ ory is , don &apos;t be a gre@@ e@@ ter ."
( Laughter ) It was really bor@@ ing .
"But then I found I could do this because I m@@ en@@ tion@@ ed , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that we@@ ir@@ d ? &quot; &quot; I m@@ en@@ tion@@ ed the d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that he was ha@@ ving ."
"And because I m@@ en@@ tion@@ ed , &quot; &quot; I@@ s that we@@ ir@@ d ? &quot; &quot; , that means I w@@ as@@ n &apos;t we@@ ir@@ d ."
"That means I was actually thinking just like him , see@@ ing this as a we@@ ir@@ d thing ."
"And again , and again , I lear@@ ned that if I m@@ en@@ tion some d@@ ou@@ b@@ t people might have before I as@@ k the question , I ga@@ in@@ ed their tr@@ ust ."
Pe@@ ople were more li@@ ke@@ ly to say y@@ es to me .
by as@@ king .
But it has always been my dre@@ am to actually te@@ ach something .
But because I didn &apos;t ru@@ n — I ke@@ p@@ t doing it — and on the th@@ ir@@ d try the pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or was very imp@@ res@@ s@@ ed .
"H@@ e was like , &quot; &quot; N@@ o one has done this before . &quot; &quot; And I came in pre@@ par@@ ed with pow@@ er@@ po@@ in@@ ts and my l@@ ess@@ on ."
"H@@ e said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I can use this ."
Wh@@ y don &apos;t you come back in two mon@@ ths ? I &apos;ll f@@ it you in my cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um . &quot; &quot; And two mon@@ ths l@@ ater I was te@@ ach@@ ing a cl@@ as@@ s .
"You know , some@@ times you get re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted by li@@ gh@@ ting , you know ?"
"I used to think I have to ac@@ comp@@ li@@ s@@ h all these things — have to be a great ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eu@@ r , or get a Ph@@ D to te@@ ach — but no , I just as@@ ked , and I could te@@ ach ."
"And in that pic@@ ture , which you can &apos;t see , I quot@@ ed M@@ ar@@ ti@@ n Lu@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because in my re@@ sear@@ ch I found that people who really change the world , who change the way we live and the way we think , are the people who were me@@ t with in@@ i@@ ti@@ al and of@@ ten vi@@ ol@@ ent re@@ j@@ ec@@ tions ."
"P@@ e@@ ople like M@@ ar@@ ti@@ n Lu@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r . , like Ma@@ h@@ at@@ m@@ a G@@ and@@ h@@ i , N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ el@@ a , or even J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ ri@@ st ."
Th@@ ese people did not let re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion de@@ f@@ ine them .
They let their own re@@ ac@@ tion after re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion de@@ f@@ ine the@@ m@@ selves .
And they em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion .
Th@@ en I started em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing it .
I tur@@ ned that into the bi@@ gg@@ est gi@@ ft in my life .
I started te@@ ach@@ ing people how to tur@@ n re@@ j@@ ec@@ tions into opp@@ ort@@ uni@@ ties .
"I use my b@@ lo@@ g , I use my talk , I use the book I just publi@@ sh@@ ed , and I &apos;m even buil@@ ding technology to help people over@@ come their fe@@ ar of re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion ."
"When you get re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted in life , when you are fac@@ ing the next ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le or next fa@@ il@@ ure , con@@ si@@ der the pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties ."
D@@ on &apos;t ru@@ n .
"If you just em@@ br@@ ace them , they might become your gi@@ f@@ ts as well ."
( Applause )
So I gu@@ ess I was the l@@ uc@@ k@@ y one .
M@@ y mo@@ ther had 1@@ 6 pre@@ gn@@ an@@ ci@@ es .
"F@@ rom 1@@ 6 pre@@ gn@@ an@@ ci@@ es , fi@@ ve of us are ali@@ ve ."
You can ima@@ gine as a chil@@ d what I went through .
I wanted to be a do@@ ct@@ or to help women and children .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , in my country , there w@@ as@@ n &apos;t a d@@ or@@ m@@ it@@ ory for g@@ ir@@ l@@ s , so I was ac@@ cep@@ ted in medi@@ cal school , but I could not go there ."
"So as a res@@ ult , my fa@@ ther s@@ ent me to Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a ."
I came to Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a .
"And do you know that at the time I was comple@@ ting my e@@ du@@ cation , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my fami@@ ly or with my country ."
"There were mon@@ ths , years , I didn &apos;t know about it ."
M@@ y fami@@ ly was in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ m@@ p .
"So as so@@ on as I comple@@ ted my e@@ du@@ cation , I br@@ ou@@ ght my fami@@ ly to Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a ."
I wanted them to be sa@@ fe .
But where was my he@@ art ?
M@@ y he@@ art was in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an .
I had a good jo@@ b .
I could live with them .
I wanted to go back home .
So I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ m@@ p .
"I sa@@ w a y@@ oun@@ g wom@@ an have no way to go any@@ where , no e@@ du@@ cation , no en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment , no place to even live ."
So it was a very de@@ va@@ st@@ ating s@@ it@@ u@@ ation .
"A@@ t that mom@@ ent , we talk about mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m ."
"A@@ t that mom@@ ent , I f@@ el@@ t , what can I do for these people ?"
How could I help these people ?
It tran@@ s@@ form@@ ed me . It ga@@ ve me st@@ at@@ us .
But do you think it was e@@ as@@ y ?
"N@@ o , because at that time , e@@ du@@ cation was b@@ an@@ ned for g@@ ir@@ l@@ s , comple@@ tely ."
S@@ om@@ e@@ body who comes from the Un@@ ited St@@ ates .
So I really nee@@ ded to buil@@ d the tr@@ ust in this comm@@ unity .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and sur@@ ve@@ y@@ ed and loo@@ ked and loo@@ ked .
I as@@ ked .
"F@@ in@@ ally , I found one man ."
He was 8@@ 0 years old .
He was a m@@ ul@@ la@@ h .
"I went to his t@@ ent in the ca@@ m@@ p , and I as@@ ked him , &quot; I want to make you a te@@ ac@@ her . &quot;"
"@@ one day I was in the off@@ ice in P@@ es@@ ha@@ w@@ ar , Pa@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
You &apos;re sc@@ ar@@ ed . You know it &apos;s d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous .
You have to ho@@ ld it together and show str@@ en@@ g@@ th .
"So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were p@@ our@@ ing into my off@@ ice ."
So I inv@@ ited them to the off@@ ice .
"They came , and there were n@@ ine of them — n@@ ine T@@ ali@@ b@@ an ."
They were the u@@ g@@ li@@ est looking m@@ en you can ever see .
They said no . They are not going to dr@@ in@@ k te@@ a .
"But also I was str@@ ong , h@@ ol@@ ding my@@ self up ."
"The only thing you could see , my ey@@ es ."
"They as@@ ked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?"
"We have some stu@@ d@@ ents coming , and they are all lear@@ ning K@@ or@@ an , H@@ o@@ ly B@@ oo@@ k ."
"B@@ y that time , my st@@ af@@ f p@@ ou@@ red into my off@@ ice ."
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
"V@@ er@@ y happ@@ y , and I was happ@@ y to be ali@@ ve , of course ."
We op@@ en@@ ed women &apos;s lear@@ ning cen@@ ter .
We wor@@ ked with mo@@ th@@ ers and children .
I was very happ@@ y . I was de@@ li@@ gh@@ ted with the out@@ come of my work .
"And by that time , the women are y@@ ell@@ ing and sc@@ re@@ am@@ ing in@@ side the ca@@ r ."
"I am very s@@ ha@@ k@@ en up , and I to@@ ld my@@ self , this is it ."
There is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t in my m@@ ind .
"You believe in your wor@@ th , and you can wal@@ k on it ."
So I just ho@@ ld my@@ self on the side of the ca@@ r .
"M@@ y le@@ g was s@@ ha@@ king , and I got out@@ side ."
"And I as@@ ked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?"
"They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are ."
"The only thing we can do , what we know , from the time we &apos;re bor@@ n , we just ho@@ ld the gu@@ n and k@@ ill ."
"It &apos;s a tra@@ p to me , of course ."
They r@@ an away home . No@@ body st@@ ay@@ ed there .
"M@@ y bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard was the only one there , and my vo@@ ice was comple@@ tely g@@ one ."
"I was s@@ ha@@ k@@ en up , and I s@@ at on my t@@ able , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to sol@@ ve this problem ?"
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of women were there coming to get tra@@ in@@ ing .
"And she as@@ ked me , &quot; &quot; S@@ ak@@ en@@ a ? &quot; &quot; And I an@@ sw@@ er@@ ed her ."
"@@ &quot; O@@ K , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;"
I to@@ ld her the whole story .
"A@@ t that time , she said , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , you go next time , and you will help them ."
"You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two d@@ ays l@@ ater , I went the same r@@ ou@@ te , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back f@@ ur@@ ther , the same y@@ oun@@ g m@@ en , st@@ an@@ ding up there and h@@ ol@@ ding the ri@@ f@@ le and po@@ in@@ ting to us to st@@ op the ca@@ r ."
So we st@@ opp@@ ed the ca@@ r .
"I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ n one con@@ di@@ tion , that wh@@ at@@ ever I say , you ac@@ cep@@ t it . &quot; &quot; And they said , y@@ es , they do ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are the best tra@@ in@@ ers ."
"So we are cont@@ in@@ u@@ ous@@ ly gi@@ ving tra@@ in@@ ing to m@@ en , and I really believe str@@ on@@ g@@ ly ."
I live in a country that was a be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful country .
I just want to sh@@ are this with you .
We were going every@@ where .
We never lo@@ c@@ ked our do@@ ors .
But we want the same Af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an we had before .
"T@@ o@@ day , the women of Af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an are working very , very hard ."
They are ear@@ ning de@@ gre@@ es . They are tra@@ in@@ ing to be la@@ wy@@ ers .
"They are tra@@ in@@ ing to be do@@ ct@@ ors , back again ."
"So it is so w@@ on@@ der@@ ful to see people like that re@@ ach their comple@@ te p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al , and all of this is going to happ@@ en ."
"We have one po@@ et , M@@ aw@@ l@@ ā@@ n@@ ā R@@ ū@@ m@@ ī ."
"And if we could do it in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an , I am s@@ ure 10@@ 0 percent that every@@ one can do it in any part of the world ."
"This is where I live . I live in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , at the s@@ ou@@ th par@@ ts of the Na@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i Na@@ tional P@@ ar@@ k ."
"Th@@ ose are my d@@ ad &apos;s co@@ ws at the back , and be@@ h@@ ind the co@@ ws , that &apos;s the Na@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i Na@@ tional P@@ ar@@ k ."
"N@@ ai@@ ro@@ b@@ i Na@@ tional P@@ ar@@ k is not f@@ en@@ c@@ ed in the s@@ ou@@ th wi@@ de@@ ly , which means w@@ il@@ d an@@ im@@ als like z@@ e@@ br@@ as mi@@ gr@@ ate out of the par@@ k f@@ re@@ ely ."
"So pre@@ dat@@ ors like li@@ ons f@@ ol@@ low them , and this is what they do ."
They k@@ ill our li@@ ve@@ st@@ oc@@ k .
"This is one of the co@@ ws which was k@@ ill@@ ed at ni@@ ght , and I just w@@ o@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning and I found it de@@ ad , and I f@@ el@@ t so b@@ ad , because it was the only b@@ ul@@ l we had ."
"M@@ y comm@@ unity , the Ma@@ as@@ a@@ i , we believe that we came from he@@ a@@ ven with all our an@@ im@@ als and all the l@@ and for h@@ er@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we val@@ ue them so much ."
So I gre@@ w up h@@ ating li@@ ons so much .
"The mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who prot@@ ect our comm@@ unity and the li@@ ve@@ st@@ oc@@ k , and they &apos;re also up@@ se@@ t about this problem ."
So they k@@ ill the li@@ ons .
It &apos;s one of the si@@ x li@@ ons which were k@@ ill@@ ed in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i .
And I think this is why the Na@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i Na@@ tional P@@ ar@@ k li@@ ons are few .
"So a bo@@ y , from si@@ x to n@@ ine years old , in my comm@@ unity is resp@@ on@@ sible for his d@@ ad &apos;s co@@ ws , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me ."
So I had to find a way of sol@@ ving this problem .
"And the first idea I got was to use fir@@ e , because I thought li@@ ons were sc@@ ar@@ ed of fir@@ e ."
"But I came to re@@ aliz@@ e that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even hel@@ p@@ ing the li@@ ons to see through the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed ."
So I didn &apos;t give up . I cont@@ in@@ u@@ ed .
And a second idea I got was to use a sc@@ ar@@ ec@@ ro@@ w .
I was trying to tri@@ c@@ k the li@@ ons &#9@@ 1@@ ; into thinking &#9@@ 3@@ ; that I was st@@ an@@ ding ne@@ ar the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed .
"But li@@ ons are very c@@ le@@ ver . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the sc@@ ar@@ ec@@ ro@@ w , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not mo@@ ving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he ju@@ mp@@ s in and k@@ ill@@ s the an@@ im@@ als ."
"So one ni@@ ght , I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed with a t@@ or@@ ch , and that day , the li@@ ons didn &apos;t come ."
And I disc@@ over@@ ed that li@@ ons are af@@ ra@@ id of a mo@@ ving light .
So I had an idea .
"S@@ in@@ ce I was a small bo@@ y , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took ap@@ art my mo@@ m &apos;s new ra@@ di@@ o , and that day she al@@ most k@@ ill@@ ed me , but I lear@@ ned a lot about elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s . ( Laughter ) So I got an old ca@@ r b@@ at@@ ter@@ y , an in@@ di@@ ca@@ t@@ or bo@@ x . It &apos;s a small de@@ v@@ ice found in a m@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ c@@ le , and it hel@@ ps m@@ ot@@ or@@ i@@ sts when they want to tur@@ n right or left . It bl@@ in@@ ks ."
"And I got a sw@@ it@@ ch where I can sw@@ it@@ ch on the li@@ gh@@ ts , on and off ."
And that &apos;s a small t@@ or@@ ch from a b@@ ro@@ k@@ en fl@@ as@@ h@@ light .
So I se@@ t up everything .
"A@@ s you can see , the sol@@ ar p@@ an@@ el ch@@ ar@@ ges the b@@ at@@ ter@@ y , and the b@@ at@@ ter@@ y su@@ pp@@ li@@ es the power to the small in@@ di@@ ca@@ t@@ or bo@@ x . I call it a tran@@ s@@ form@@ er ."
And the in@@ di@@ ca@@ t@@ or bo@@ x ma@@ kes the li@@ gh@@ ts fl@@ as@@ h .
"A@@ s you can see , the b@@ ul@@ b@@ s face out@@ side , because that &apos;s where the li@@ ons come from ."
And that &apos;s how it loo@@ ks to li@@ ons when they come at ni@@ ght .
"The li@@ gh@@ ts fl@@ as@@ h and tri@@ c@@ k the li@@ ons into thinking I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed , but I was s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing in my b@@ ed ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks .
"So I se@@ t it up in my home two years ago , and s@@ in@@ ce then , we have never experi@@ en@@ c@@ ed any problem with li@@ ons ."
And my ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ing h@@ om@@ es he@@ ard about this idea .
On@@ e of them was this gr@@ and@@ mo@@ ther .
"S@@ he had a lot of her an@@ im@@ als being k@@ ill@@ ed by li@@ ons , and she as@@ ked me if I could put the li@@ gh@@ ts for her ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; So I put the li@@ gh@@ ts . You can see at the back , those are the lion li@@ gh@@ ts ."
"S@@ in@@ ce now , I &apos;ve se@@ t up se@@ ven h@@ om@@ es around my comm@@ unity , and they &apos;re really working ."
"And my idea is also being used now all over K@@ en@@ y@@ a for sc@@ ar@@ ing other pre@@ dat@@ ors like hy@@ en@@ as , le@@ op@@ ar@@ ds , and it &apos;s also being used to sc@@ are el@@ e@@ ph@@ an@@ ts away from people &apos;s f@@ ar@@ ms ."
"@@ Because of this inv@@ en@@ tion , I was l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to get a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p in one of the best sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , B@@ ro@@ ok@@ h@@ ou@@ se In@@ ter@@ na@@ tional S@@ ch@@ ool , and I &apos;m really ex@@ c@@ ited about this ."
M@@ y new school now is coming in and hel@@ p@@ ing by f@@ und@@ ra@@ is@@ ing and cre@@ ating an aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess .
"I even took my fri@@ en@@ ds back to my comm@@ unity , and we &apos;re in@@ st@@ all@@ ing the li@@ gh@@ ts to the h@@ om@@ es which don &apos;t have &#9@@ 1@@ ; any &#9@@ 3@@ ; , and I &apos;m te@@ ach@@ ing them how to put them ."
"So one year ago , I was just a bo@@ y in the sa@@ v@@ an@@ n@@ a gr@@ as@@ sl@@ and h@@ er@@ ding my fa@@ ther &apos;s co@@ ws , and I used to see plan@@ es fl@@ ying over , and I to@@ ld my@@ self that one day , I &apos;ll be there in@@ side ."
And here I am today .
I got a chan@@ ce to come by plan@@ e for my first time for TE@@ D .
So my big dre@@ am is to become an a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ ft en@@ gin@@ e@@ er and pi@@ lot when I gro@@ w up .
"I used to h@@ ate li@@ ons , but now because my inv@@ en@@ tion is sa@@ ving my fa@@ ther &apos;s co@@ ws and the li@@ ons , we are able to st@@ ay with the li@@ ons with@@ out any con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ t ."
"A@@ sh@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n . It means in my l@@ an@@ gu@@ age , th@@ ank you very much ."
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : You have no idea how ex@@ c@@ iting it is to he@@ ar a story like y@@ our@@ s .

"A@@ t that age , I also lear@@ ned about what an an@@ im@@ at@@ or was ."
There was a pro@@ gra@@ m on T@@ V about j@@ ob@@ s most ki@@ ds don &apos;t know about .

A@@ ni@@ ma@@ tion and art has always been my first love .
"It was my love for technology that sp@@ ar@@ ked the idea for &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ ici@@ ous Di@@ sh@@ es . &quot; &quot; There was a vir@@ us on my compu@@ ter , and I was trying to get ri@@ d of it , and all of a su@@ dd@@ en , I just thought , what if vir@@ us@@ es have their own little world in@@ side the compu@@ ter ?"
M@@ ay@@ be a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant where they me@@ et up and do vir@@ us@@ y things ?
"And th@@ us , &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ ici@@ ous Di@@ sh@@ es &quot; &quot; was bor@@ n ."
"A@@ t four years old , my d@@ ad show@@ ed me how to take ap@@ art a compu@@ ter and put it back together again ."
That started my love for technology .
"I buil@@ t my first we@@ bs@@ ite my@@ self in H@@ T@@ M@@ L , and I &apos;m lear@@ ning J@@ a@@ va@@ S@@ cri@@ p@@ t and Py@@ th@@ on ."
I &apos;m also working on an an@@ im@@ ated ser@@ ies called &quot; &quot; The P@@ oll@@ in@@ at@@ ors . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about be@@ es and other p@@ oll@@ in@@ at@@ ors in our en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment and why they &apos;re so important .

"And I thought , I can start my own bus@@ iness ."
Now I didn &apos;t have any bus@@ iness pl@@ ans at only ei@@ ght years old .
I only k@@ new I wanted to make pret@@ ty cre@@ ations that were sa@@ fe for the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment and I wanted to give back .

"Now , this le@@ vel of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion be@@ comes very important ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people and l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , we ei@@ ther in@@ vo@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; &quot; no@@ ble sa@@ v@@ age , &quot; &quot; which is an idea r@@ ac@@ ist in its si@@ mp@@ li@@ city , or al@@ ter@@ na@@ ti@@ ve@@ ly , we in@@ vo@@ ke Th@@ o@@ re@@ a@@ u and say these people are cl@@ os@@ er to the E@@ ar@@ th than we are ."

"Now , what does that mean ?"
It means that a y@@ oun@@ g k@@ id from the An@@ des who &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that m@@ oun@@ ta@@ in is an Ap@@ u sp@@ ir@@ it that will di@@ rec@@ t his or her de@@ st@@ in@@ y will be a pro@@ f@@ oun@@ d@@ ly different human being and have a different re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p to that res@@ our@@ ce or that place than a y@@ oun@@ g k@@ id from M@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ a ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a m@@ oun@@ ta@@ in is a pi@@ le of ro@@ c@@ k ready to be min@@ ed .
W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s the ab@@ o@@ de of a sp@@ ir@@ it or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ re@@ le@@ v@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or that de@@ fin@@ es the re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p between the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al and the nat@@ ur@@ al world .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the fo@@ re@@ sts of B@@ ri@@ ti@@ s@@ h C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those fo@@ re@@ sts ex@@ i@@ st@@ ed to be c@@ ut .
"That made me a different human being than my fri@@ en@@ ds am@@ on@@ g@@ st the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those fo@@ re@@ sts were the ab@@ o@@ de of Hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked Be@@ a@@ k of H@@ ea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al sp@@ ir@@ its that d@@ w@@ ell@@ ed at the n@@ or@@ th end of the world , sp@@ ir@@ its they would have to en@@ g@@ age d@@ ur@@ ing their H@@ am@@ at@@ s@@ a in@@ i@@ ti@@ ation ."

"And secon@@ d@@ ly , we con@@ si@@ der no@@ i@@ se very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ i@@ se .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qu@@ i@@ et space .
"And in this k@@ in@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten , these children show a@@ ma@@ zing con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tion in cl@@ as@@ s ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the j@@ un@@ g@@ le with no@@ i@@ se ."
They need no@@ i@@ se .
"And you know , you can talk to your fri@@ en@@ ds in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed to be in s@@ il@@ ence .
"You know , it &apos;s comple@@ tely op@@ en ."
And you should know that we can go s@@ ki@@ ing in -@@ 2@@ 0 de@@ gre@@ es in w@@ in@@ ter .
I@@ n su@@ mm@@ er you go sw@@ im@@ m@@ ing .
The s@@ and is 5@@ 0 de@@ gre@@ es .
"And also , you should know that you are w@@ at@@ er@@ pro@@ of ."
You never m@@ el@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed to be out@@ side ."
So that is how we should tre@@ at them .
This is how they di@@ vi@@ de cl@@ as@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
They are su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed to help te@@ ach@@ ers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A cl@@ as@@ s@@ room .
And a w@@ as@@ h@@ bas@@ in .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the cl@@ as@@ s@@ room .
A mon@@ k@@ ey trying to f@@ ish another mon@@ k@@ ey from ab@@ o@@ ve .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each cl@@ as@@ s@@ room has at le@@ ast one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ an@@ t@@ a Cl@@ au@@ s comes down at the time of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x buil@@ ding , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ sh@@ ap@@ ed k@@ in@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten ."
The buil@@ ding is only fi@@ ve me@@ ters t@@ all with se@@ ven f@@ lo@@ ors .
"And of course , the ce@@ il@@ ing he@@ i@@ ght is very low ."
So you have to con@@ si@@ der sa@@ fe@@ ty .
"So , we put our children , a d@@ aughter and a son ."
They tri@@ ed to go in .
He h@@ it his he@@ ad .
He &apos;s ok@@ ay . H@@ is sk@@ ul@@ l is quite str@@ ong .
He is re@@ si@@ li@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to j@@ um@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ ff@@ ic j@@ am is aw@@ ful in T@@ ok@@ y@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in fr@@ on@@ t , she nee@@ ds to lear@@ n how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now , this d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing is show@@ ing the mo@@ v@@ ement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 3@@ 0 ."
And the c@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ f@@ er@@ ence of this buil@@ ding is 18@@ 3 me@@ ters .
So it &apos;s not ex@@ ac@@ tly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 me@@ ters in the mor@@ ning ."
But the sur@@ pri@@ se is ye@@ t to come .
"The children in this k@@ in@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 me@@ ters on a@@ ver@@ age ."
And these children have the high@@ est a@@ th@@ le@@ tic ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties am@@ ong many k@@ in@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ s .
"The pr@@ in@@ ci@@ p@@ al sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We lea@@ ve them on to@@ p of the ro@@ of ."
"M@@ y point is don &apos;t cont@@ ro@@ l them , don &apos;t prot@@ ect them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble some@@ times ."
They need to get some in@@ j@@ ur@@ y .
And that ma@@ kes them lear@@ n how to live in this world .
And this is one of the at@@ te@@ mp@@ ts to change the li@@ ves of children .
Thank you very much .
H@@ ere are some ima@@ ges of cl@@ u@@ st@@ ers of g@@ al@@ ax@@ ies .
They &apos;re ex@@ ac@@ tly what they s@@ ound like .
"They are these hu@@ ge coll@@ ec@@ tions of g@@ al@@ ax@@ ies , b@@ ound together by their mu@@ tu@@ al gra@@ v@@ ity ."
"So most of the po@@ in@@ ts that you see on the sc@@ re@@ en are not in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al st@@ ars , but coll@@ ec@@ tions of st@@ ars , or g@@ al@@ ax@@ ies ."
U@@ se@@ ful as the uni@@ ver@@ se &apos;s most ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ ies .
"And as l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ ies , to des@@ cri@@ be g@@ al@@ ax@@ y cl@@ u@@ st@@ ers is to des@@ cri@@ be the exper@@ im@@ ents that you can do with them ."
"And I think there are four ma@@ j@@ or t@@ yp@@ es , and the first t@@ yp@@ e that I want to des@@ cri@@ be is prob@@ ing the very big ."
"So , how big ?"
"Well , here is an ima@@ ge of a par@@ tic@@ ular g@@ al@@ ax@@ y cl@@ u@@ ster ."
"And , in fact , if you look very car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly you &apos;ll be able to see r@@ ings around this cl@@ u@@ ster ."
"Now , to give you a number , this par@@ tic@@ ular g@@ al@@ ax@@ y cl@@ u@@ ster has a ma@@ s@@ s of over one million bil@@ lion s@@ un@@ s ."
It &apos;s just min@@ d-@@ bo@@ gg@@ l@@ ing how ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve these sy@@ st@@ ems can get .
"But more than their ma@@ s@@ s , they have this ad@@ di@@ tional fe@@ at@@ ure ."
"They are ess@@ enti@@ ally is@@ ol@@ ated sy@@ st@@ ems , so if we like , we can think of them as a sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sion of the enti@@ re uni@@ ver@@ se ."
"And many of the ques@@ tions that we might have about the uni@@ ver@@ se at lar@@ ge sc@@ al@@ es , s@@ uch as , how does gra@@ v@@ ity work ?"
might be an@@ sw@@ er@@ ed by stu@@ d@@ ying these sy@@ st@@ ems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very ho@@ t .
"O@@ k@@ ay , if I take an ima@@ ge of a g@@ al@@ ax@@ y cl@@ u@@ ster , and I su@@ b@@ tr@@ act away all of the star@@ light , what I &apos;m left with is this big , bl@@ ue b@@ lo@@ b ."
This is in f@@ al@@ se col@@ or .
It &apos;s actually X-@@ r@@ ay light that we &apos;re see@@ ing .
"And the question is , if it &apos;s not g@@ al@@ ax@@ ies , what is em@@ it@@ ting this light ?"
"The an@@ sw@@ er is ho@@ t g@@ as , mil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e g@@ as — in fact , it &apos;s pl@@ as@@ m@@ a ."
And the reas@@ on why it &apos;s so ho@@ t go@@ es back to the pre@@ vi@@ ous s@@ li@@ de .
"The ex@@ tre@@ me gra@@ v@@ ity of these sy@@ st@@ ems is ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ating par@@ ti@@ cl@@ es of g@@ as to great spe@@ e@@ ds , and great spe@@ e@@ ds means great te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res ."
"So this is the ma@@ in idea , but sci@@ ence is a r@@ ough d@@ ra@@ ft ."
Th@@ ir@@ d thing : prob@@ ing the very small .
"Now , to ex@@ pla@@ in this , I need to tell you a very di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ing fact ."
M@@ ost of the uni@@ ver@@ se &apos;s mat@@ ter is not made up of at@@ om@@ s .
You were li@@ ed to .
"M@@ ost of it is made up of something very , very my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous , which we call d@@ ar@@ k mat@@ ter ."
"D@@ ar@@ k mat@@ ter is something that doesn &apos;t like to inter@@ act very much , ex@@ cep@@ t through gra@@ v@@ ity , and of course we would like to lear@@ n more about it ."
"If you &apos;re a par@@ tic@@ le ph@@ ys@@ ic@@ ist , you want to know what happen@@ s when we s@@ ma@@ s@@ h things together ."
And d@@ ar@@ k mat@@ ter is no ex@@ cep@@ tion .
"Well , how do we do this ?"
"T@@ o an@@ sw@@ er that question , I &apos;m going to have to as@@ k another one , which is , what happen@@ s when g@@ al@@ ax@@ y cl@@ u@@ st@@ ers col@@ li@@ de ?"
H@@ ere is an ima@@ ge .
"S@@ in@@ ce g@@ al@@ ax@@ y cl@@ u@@ st@@ ers are re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tive s@@ li@@ ces of the uni@@ ver@@ se , sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ si@@ ons ."
"They are m@@ os@@ tly made up of d@@ ar@@ k mat@@ ter , and that &apos;s what you see in this bl@@ u@@ ish p@@ ur@@ ple ."
"The red re@@ pres@@ ents the ho@@ t g@@ as , and , of course , you can see many g@@ al@@ ax@@ ies ."
"Wh@@ at &apos;s happened is a par@@ tic@@ le ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ at@@ or at a hu@@ ge , hu@@ ge sc@@ ale ."
"And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small eff@@ ects that might be diff@@ ic@@ ult to de@@ t@@ ect in the la@@ b , might be comp@@ oun@@ ded and comp@@ oun@@ ded into something that we could pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly ob@@ ser@@ ve in nat@@ ure ."
"So , it &apos;s very f@@ un@@ n@@ y ."
"The reas@@ on why g@@ al@@ ax@@ y cl@@ u@@ st@@ ers can te@@ ach us about d@@ ar@@ k mat@@ ter , the reas@@ on why g@@ al@@ ax@@ y cl@@ u@@ st@@ ers can te@@ ach us about the ph@@ ys@@ ic@@ s of the very small , is pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly because they are so very big ."
F@@ our@@ th thing : the ph@@ ys@@ ic@@ s of the very str@@ an@@ ge .
C@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ly what I &apos;ve said so f@@ ar is c@@ ra@@ z@@ y .
"O@@ k@@ ay , if there &apos;s any@@ thing str@@ an@@ ger I think it has to be d@@ ar@@ k energy ."
"If I th@@ ro@@ w a b@@ all into the a@@ ir , I exp@@ ect it to go up ."
What I don &apos;t exp@@ ect is that it go up at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing r@@ ate .
"S@@ im@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , c@@ os@@ mo@@ logi@@ sts understand why the uni@@ ver@@ se is exp@@ an@@ ding ."
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s exp@@ an@@ ding at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing r@@ ate .
"They give the cause of this ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ated exp@@ an@@ sion a na@@ me , and they call it d@@ ar@@ k energy ."
"And , again , we want to lear@@ n more about it ."
"So , one par@@ tic@@ ular question that we have is , how does d@@ ar@@ k energy a@@ ff@@ ect the uni@@ ver@@ se at the lar@@ g@@ est sc@@ al@@ es ?"
"D@@ ep@@ en@@ ding on how str@@ ong it is , maybe struc@@ ture for@@ ms fa@@ ster or s@@ low@@ er ."
"Well , the problem with the lar@@ ge@@ -@@ sc@@ ale struc@@ ture of the uni@@ ver@@ se is that it &apos;s h@@ or@@ ri@@ b@@ ly comp@@ li@@ ca@@ ted ."
H@@ ere is a compu@@ ter si@@ m@@ ul@@ ation .
And we need a way to si@@ mp@@ li@@ f@@ y it .
"Well , I like to think about this using an an@@ al@@ o@@ gy ."
The most important thing to do is to tr@@ ack the two bi@@ gg@@ est par@@ ts .
"So , as I come to a cl@@ ose , you might feel s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly ch@@ e@@ ated ."
"I mean , I be@@ g@@ an by tal@@ king about how g@@ al@@ ax@@ y cl@@ u@@ st@@ ers are us@@ e@@ ful , and I &apos;ve gi@@ ven some reas@@ ons , but what is their use really ?"
"Well , to an@@ sw@@ er this , I want to give you a quot@@ e by H@@ en@@ ry F@@ or@@ d when he was as@@ ked about c@@ ars ."
"H@@ e had this to say : &quot; &quot; I@@ f I had as@@ ked people what they wanted , they would have said fa@@ ster h@@ or@@ ses . &quot; &quot; To@@ day , we as a soci@@ e@@ ty are fac@@ ed with many , many diff@@ ic@@ ult proble@@ ms ."
And the sol@@ u@@ tions to these proble@@ ms are not ob@@ vi@@ ous .
They are not fa@@ ster h@@ or@@ ses .
They will re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous am@@ oun@@ t of sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity .
"So , y@@ es , we need to fo@@ c@@ us , y@@ es , we need to con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate , but we also need to re@@ memb@@ er that in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity , in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion — these things come when we b@@ ro@@ ad@@ en our fi@@ el@@ d of vi@@ sion when we ste@@ p back when we z@@ oo@@ m out ."
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by stu@@ d@@ ying the uni@@ ver@@ se around us . Th@@ an@@ ks .

"I don &apos;t know if any@@ body might ha@@ il from n@@ or@@ the@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ an@@ i@@ a , but this is where I sp@@ ent my first 1@@ 9 years with my little y@@ oun@@ g l@@ un@@ gs ."

"And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those p@@ il@@ es of b@@ ur@@ ning , sm@@ ol@@ der@@ ing co@@ al wa@@ st@@ e look like ."
"So then I deci@@ ded to lea@@ ve that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mi@@ d-@@ w@@ est ."

"Well , I deci@@ ded to be ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors to a place called Ru@@ bb@@ er@@ to@@ wn ."
They man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture pl@@ as@@ tic@@ s . They use lar@@ ge qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ties ch@@ l@@ or@@ op@@ r@@ en@@ e and b@@ en@@ z@@ en@@ e .
"O@@ k@@ ay , I sp@@ ent 2@@ 5 years , in my mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ age l@@ un@@ gs now , bre@@ a@@ thing v@@ ari@@ ous con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tions of that ."
"And on a c@@ le@@ ar day it always loo@@ ked like this , so you never sa@@ w it ."
It was in@@ si@@ di@@ ous and it was really happen@@ ing .

Ok@@ ay ? Al@@ most like the high@@ est in the n@@ ation .

"If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m tal@@ king about ."
"So , what &apos;s wr@@ ong with this pic@@ ture ?"
"Well , the pic@@ ture is , there is a hu@@ ge ga@@ p here ."
The one thing that never happen@@ s in my do@@ ct@@ or &apos;s off@@ ice : They never as@@ k me about my place hi@@ story .
"N@@ o do@@ ct@@ or , can I re@@ memb@@ er , ever as@@ king me , &quot; W@@ here have you li@@ ved ? &quot;"
They ha@@ ven &apos;t as@@ ked me what kind of the qu@@ ality of the dr@@ in@@ king water that I put in my m@@ ou@@ th or the food that I ing@@ est into my st@@ om@@ ach .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s m@@ is@@ sing .
L@@ oo@@ k at the kind of data that &apos;s a@@ va@@ il@@ able .
This data &apos;s from all over the world — coun@@ tries sp@@ end bil@@ li@@ ons of doll@@ ars in@@ ve@@ st@@ ing in this kind of re@@ sear@@ ch .
"Now , I &apos;ve c@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed the plac@@ es where I &apos;ve been ."
"Well , by design , if I wanted to have a he@@ art at@@ t@@ ack I &apos;d been in the right plac@@ es . Ri@@ ght ?"
"So , how many people are in the wh@@ ite ?"
How many people in the room have sp@@ ent the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of their life in the wh@@ ite space ?
An@@ y@@ body ? Bo@@ y you &apos;re l@@ uc@@ k@@ y .
How many have sp@@ ent it in the red plac@@ es ?
"O@@ h , not so l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ."
There are thou@@ s@@ ands of these k@@ in@@ ds of m@@ ap@@ s that are dis@@ pl@@ ay@@ ed in at@@ l@@ as@@ es all over the world .
They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our tra@@ in w@@ rec@@ k .
But n@@ one of that &apos;s in my medi@@ cal rec@@ or@@ d .
And it &apos;s not in y@@ our@@ s ei@@ ther .
"So , here &apos;s my fri@@ end P@@ au@@ l ."
"H@@ e &apos;s a col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue . He al@@ low@@ ed his c@@ ell ph@@ one to be tr@@ ac@@ ked every two h@@ our@@ s , 2@@ 4 / 7 , 3@@ 6@@ 5 d@@ ays out of the year for the last two years , every@@ where he went ."
And you can see he &apos;s been to a few plac@@ es around the Un@@ ited St@@ ates .
And this is where he has sp@@ ent most of his time .
I@@ f you really stu@@ di@@ ed that you might have some cl@@ u@@ es as to what P@@ au@@ l li@@ kes to do .
An@@ y@@ body got any cl@@ u@@ es ? Sk@@ i . Ri@@ ght .
"We can z@@ oo@@ m in here , and we su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly see that now we see where P@@ au@@ l has really sp@@ ent a ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of his time ."
And all of those bl@@ ack d@@ ots are all of the to@@ x@@ ic re@@ le@@ ase inv@@ ent@@ or@@ ies that are mon@@ it@@ o@@ red by the E@@ P@@ A .
D@@ id you know that data ex@@ i@@ st@@ ed ?
"F@@ or every comm@@ unity in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , you could have your own per@@ s@@ on@@ aliz@@ ed ma@@ p of that ."
"So , our c@@ ell ph@@ ones can now buil@@ d a place hi@@ story ."
This is how P@@ au@@ l did it . He did it with his i@@ Ph@@ one .
This might be what we end up with .
This is what the ph@@ ys@@ ici@@ an would have in fr@@ on@@ t of him and her when we en@@ ter that ex@@ am room in@@ ste@@ ad of just the p@@ in@@ k s@@ li@@ p that said I pa@@ id at the coun@@ ter . Ri@@ ght ?
This could be my little as@@ s@@ es@@ sm@@ ent .
"And he loo@@ ks at that and he sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a B@@ ill , I su@@ gg@@ est that maybe you not deci@@ de , just because you &apos;re out here in be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , and it &apos;s war@@ m every day , that you get out and ru@@ n at si@@ x o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ c@@ k at ni@@ ght ."
"I &apos;d su@@ gg@@ est that that &apos;s a b@@ ad idea B@@ ill , because of this re@@ p@@ ort . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to lea@@ ve you for are two pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tions ."
"O@@ k@@ ay , number one is , we m@@ ust te@@ ach ph@@ ys@@ ici@@ ans about the val@@ ue of ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ cal information ."
It &apos;s called ge@@ om@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ ine . There are about a hal@@ f a do@@ z@@ en pro@@ gra@@ ms in the world right now that are fo@@ c@@ used on this .
And they &apos;re in the ear@@ ly st@@ ag@@ es of develop@@ ment .
"Th@@ ese pro@@ gra@@ ms need to be su@@ pp@@ or@@ ted , and we need to te@@ ach our future do@@ ct@@ ors of the world the import@@ ance of some of the information I &apos;ve sh@@ ar@@ ed here with you today ."
"The second thing we need to do is wh@@ i@@ le we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding bil@@ li@@ ons and bil@@ li@@ ons of doll@@ ars all over the world buil@@ ding an elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic heal@@ th rec@@ or@@ d , we make s@@ ure we put a place hi@@ story in@@ side that medi@@ cal rec@@ or@@ d ."
It not only will be important for the ph@@ ys@@ ici@@ an ; it will be important for the re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers that now will have hu@@ ge sa@@ m@@ pl@@ es to d@@ ra@@ w up@@ on .
But it will also be us@@ e@@ ful for us .
"I could have made the deci@@ sion , if I had this information , not to mo@@ ve to the o@@ z@@ one cap@@ it@@ al of the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , cou@@ ldn &apos;t I ? I could make that deci@@ sion ."
O@@ r I could ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate with my e@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ er to make that deci@@ sion in the best inter@@ est of my@@ self and my comp@@ any .
"W@@ ith that , I would like to just say that J@@ ack L@@ or@@ d said this al@@ most 10 years ago ."
J@@ ust look at that for a min@@ ut@@ e .
"That was what the con@@ cl@@ us@@ i@@ on of the D@@ ar@@ t@@ m@@ ou@@ th A@@ tl@@ as of H@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ c@@ are was about , was sa@@ ying that we can ex@@ pla@@ in the ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ c v@@ ari@@ ations that oc@@ cu@@ r in di@@ se@@ ase , in ill@@ n@@ ess , in w@@ ell@@ n@@ ess , and how our heal@@ th@@ c@@ are system actually op@@ er@@ ates ."
That was what he was tal@@ king about on that quot@@ e .
And I would say he got it right al@@ most a de@@ ca@@ de ago .
"So , I &apos;d very much like to see us be@@ g@@ in to really se@@ iz@@ e this as an opp@@ ort@@ unity to get this into our medi@@ cal rec@@ or@@ ds ."
"So with that , I &apos;ll lea@@ ve you that in my par@@ tic@@ ular vi@@ e@@ w of vi@@ e@@ w of heal@@ th : Ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y always mat@@ ters ."
And I believe that ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ c information can make bot@@ h you and me very heal@@ th@@ y . Thank you .

"So I was tra@@ in@@ ed to become a gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast for two years in H@@ un@@ an , Ch@@ in@@ a in the 19@@ 70@@ s ."

It is not important if I like the jo@@ b or not .

And what I understand from my B@@ ra@@ z@@ i@@ li@@ an fri@@ en@@ ds is that this gu@@ y is just a cli@@ ch@@ e m@@ ach@@ ine .
He can ru@@ in the most interesting mat@@ ch by just sp@@ ou@@ ting cli@@ ch@@ e again and again and again .
"So B@@ ra@@ z@@ i@@ li@@ ans went to that first mat@@ ch aga@@ in@@ st N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , put up this b@@ an@@ n@@ er , started a Tw@@ it@@ ter ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n and tri@@ ed to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce the re@@ st of us to tw@@ e@@ et the ph@@ r@@ ase : &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ va@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so s@@ uc@@ c@@ ess@@ ful at this that it t@@ opp@@ ed Tw@@ it@@ ter for two we@@ e@@ ks ."
Now there &apos;s a cou@@ ple — there &apos;s a cou@@ ple of l@@ ess@@ ons that you can take from this .
"And the first l@@ ess@@ on , which I think is a wor@@ th@@ wh@@ i@@ le one , is that you can@@ not go wr@@ ong as@@ king people to be ac@@ tive on@@ line , so long as ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ s@@ m just means re@@ tw@@ e@@ e@@ ting a ph@@ r@@ ase ."
"So as long as ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ s@@ m is that si@@ mple , it &apos;s pret@@ ty e@@ as@@ y to get away with ."
"The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of B@@ ra@@ z@@ i@@ li@@ ans on Tw@@ it@@ ter ."
There &apos;s more than fi@@ ve million of them .
"A@@ s f@@ ar as na@@ tional re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tion , 1@@ 1 percent of B@@ ra@@ z@@ i@@ li@@ an inter@@ ne@@ t us@@ ers are on Tw@@ it@@ ter ."
That &apos;s a much high@@ er number than in the U.@@ S@@ . or U.@@ K@@ .
"N@@ ex@@ t to J@@ ap@@ an , it &apos;s the second most re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted by p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation ."
"Now if you &apos;re using Tw@@ it@@ ter or other soci@@ al ne@@ t@@ wor@@ ks , and you didn &apos;t re@@ aliz@@ e this was a space with a lot of B@@ ra@@ z@@ i@@ li@@ ans in it , you &apos;re like most of us ."
Because what happen@@ s on a soci@@ al ne@@ t@@ work is you inter@@ act with the people that you have ch@@ os@@ en to inter@@ act with .
"And if you are like me , a big , ge@@ e@@ k@@ y , wh@@ ite , Am@@ eri@@ can gu@@ y , you t@@ end to inter@@ act with a lot of other ge@@ e@@ k@@ y , wh@@ ite , Am@@ eri@@ can gu@@ ys ."
And you don &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly have the sense that Tw@@ it@@ ter is in fact a very he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly B@@ ra@@ z@@ i@@ li@@ an space .
"It &apos;s also ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly sur@@ pri@@ sing to many Am@@ er@@ ic@@ ans , a he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Am@@ eri@@ can space ."
Tw@@ it@@ ter rec@@ ently did some re@@ sear@@ ch .
They loo@@ ked at their lo@@ cal p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation .
They believe that 2@@ 4 percent of Am@@ eri@@ can Tw@@ it@@ ter us@@ ers are Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Am@@ eri@@ can .
That &apos;s about tw@@ ice as hi@@ gh as Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Am@@ er@@ ic@@ ans are re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted in the p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation .
"And again , that was very sh@@ oc@@ king to many Tw@@ it@@ ter us@@ ers , but it sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be ."
And the reas@@ on it sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into Tr@@ en@@ ding T@@ op@@ ic@@ s .
And you t@@ end to find t@@ op@@ ic@@ s that are al@@ most enti@@ re@@ ly Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Am@@ eri@@ can con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions .
"This was a vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ ation done by F@@ er@@ n@@ an@@ do V@@ i@@ eg@@ as and M@@ ar@@ ti@@ n W@@ at@@ ten@@ b@@ er@@ g , two a@@ ma@@ zing vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ ation desig@@ n@@ ers , who loo@@ ked at a we@@ e@@ k@@ end &apos;s wor@@ th of Tw@@ it@@ ter tra@@ ff@@ ic and ess@@ enti@@ ally found that a lot of these tr@@ en@@ ding t@@ op@@ ic@@ s were bas@@ ically se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions — and in ways that you w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t exp@@ ect ."
"It tur@@ ns out that o@@ il sp@@ ill is a m@@ os@@ tly wh@@ ite con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , that c@@ oo@@ k@@ out is a m@@ os@@ tly bl@@ ack con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"And what &apos;s c@@ ra@@ z@@ y about this is that if you wanted to mi@@ x up who you were see@@ ing on Tw@@ it@@ ter , it &apos;s lit@@ er@@ ally a qu@@ ic@@ k cli@@ c@@ k away ."
"You cli@@ c@@ k on that c@@ oo@@ k@@ out ta@@ g , there an enti@@ re@@ ly different con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with different people par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating in it ."
"But gener@@ ally spe@@ a@@ king , most of us don &apos;t ."
"We end up with@@ in these f@@ il@@ ter bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es , as my fri@@ end El@@ i P@@ ar@@ is@@ er call@@ s them , where we see the people we al@@ ready know and the people who are si@@ mil@@ ar to the people we al@@ ready know ."
And we t@@ end not to see that wi@@ der pic@@ ture .
"Now for me , I &apos;m sur@@ pri@@ s@@ ed by this , because this w@@ as@@ n &apos;t how the inter@@ ne@@ t was su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed to be ."
"If you go back into the ear@@ ly d@@ ays of the inter@@ ne@@ t , when cy@@ b@@ er@@ -@@ ut@@ op@@ i@@ ans like N@@ ic@@ k Ne@@ gro@@ p@@ on@@ te were wr@@ iting big bo@@ o@@ ks like &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing D@@ ig@@ it@@ al , &quot; &quot; the pre@@ di@@ c@@ tion was that the inter@@ ne@@ t was going to be an incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly pow@@ er@@ ful for@@ ce to s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h out cul@@ tur@@ al differ@@ en@@ ces , to put us all on a comm@@ on fi@@ el@@ d of one f@@ as@@ hi@@ on or another ."
Ne@@ gro@@ p@@ on@@ te started his book with a story about how hard it is to buil@@ d con@@ nec@@ tions in the world of at@@ om@@ s .
He &apos;s at a technology con@@ f@@ er@@ ence in Fl@@ or@@ id@@ a .
"And he &apos;s looking at something really , tr@@ u@@ ly ab@@ sur@@ d , which is bot@@ tl@@ es of E@@ vi@@ an water on the t@@ able ."
And Ne@@ gro@@ p@@ on@@ te sa@@ ys this is c@@ ra@@ z@@ y .
This is the old econom@@ y .
"It &apos;s the econom@@ y of mo@@ ving these he@@ av@@ y , s@@ low at@@ om@@ s over long di@@ st@@ an@@ ces that &apos;s very diff@@ ic@@ ult to do ."
"We &apos;re he@@ ad@@ ing to the future of b@@ its , where everything is spe@@ e@@ dy , it &apos;s we@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ less ."
It can be any@@ where in the world at any time .
And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
"Now , Ne@@ gro@@ p@@ on@@ te has been right about a lot of things ."
He &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally wr@@ ong about this one .
It tur@@ ns out that in many ca@@ ses at@@ om@@ s are much more mo@@ bi@@ le than b@@ its .
"If I wal@@ k into a st@@ ore in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , it &apos;s very , very e@@ as@@ y for me to bu@@ y water that &apos;s bot@@ tl@@ ed in Fi@@ j@@ i , shi@@ pp@@ ed at great exp@@ en@@ se to the Un@@ ited St@@ ates ."
It &apos;s actually sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly hard for me to see a Fi@@ ji@@ an fe@@ at@@ ure f@@ il@@ m .
It &apos;s really diff@@ ic@@ ult for me to li@@ st@@ en to Fi@@ ji@@ an mus@@ ic .
"It &apos;s ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly diff@@ ic@@ ult for me to get Fi@@ ji@@ an ne@@ ws , which is str@@ an@@ ge , because actually there &apos;s an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous am@@ oun@@ t going on in Fi@@ j@@ i ."
There &apos;s a cou@@ p gover@@ n@@ ment . There &apos;s a mil@@ it@@ ary gover@@ n@@ ment .
There &apos;s cr@@ ac@@ k@@ do@@ wn@@ s on the pres@@ s .
It &apos;s actually a place that we prob@@ ably should be p@@ ay@@ ing at@@ ten@@ tion to at the mom@@ ent .
H@@ ere &apos;s what I think is going on .
I think that we t@@ end to look a lot at the in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture of g@@ lob@@ aliz@@ ation .
We look at the f@@ ra@@ me@@ work that ma@@ kes it pos@@ sible to live in this con@@ nec@@ ted world .
And that &apos;s a f@@ ra@@ me@@ work that in@@ cl@@ u@@ des things like a@@ ir@@ line r@@ out@@ es .
It in@@ cl@@ u@@ des things like the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t ca@@ bl@@ es .
"We look at a ma@@ p like this one , and it loo@@ ks like the enti@@ re world is fl@@ at because everything is a ho@@ p or two away ."
"You can get on a f@@ light in L@@ on@@ don , you can end up in B@@ an@@ g@@ al@@ ore l@@ ater today ."
"T@@ w@@ o hop@@ s , you &apos;re in Su@@ v@@ a , the cap@@ it@@ o@@ l of Fi@@ j@@ i ."
It &apos;s all right there .
"When you start looking at what actually f@@ low@@ s on to@@ p of these ne@@ t@@ wor@@ ks , you get a very different pic@@ ture ."
"You start looking at how the g@@ lob@@ al plan@@ e f@@ li@@ gh@@ ts mo@@ ve , and you su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly disc@@ over that the world is@@ n &apos;t even cl@@ ose to fl@@ at ."
It &apos;s ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly l@@ u@@ mp@@ y .
"There are par@@ ts of the world that are very , very well con@@ nec@@ ted ."
There &apos;s bas@@ ically a gi@@ ant pa@@ th@@ way in the sk@@ y between L@@ on@@ don and Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k .
"@@ but look at this ma@@ p , and you can w@@ at@@ ch this for , you know , two or three min@@ ut@@ es ."
You w@@ on &apos;t see very many plan@@ es go from S@@ ou@@ th Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a to Afri@@ c@@ a .
And you &apos;ll disc@@ over that there are par@@ ts of the g@@ lo@@ be that are sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally c@@ ut off .
"When we st@@ op looking at the in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture that ma@@ kes con@@ nec@@ tion pos@@ sible , and we look at what actually happen@@ s , we start re@@ aliz@@ ing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does ."
So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interest@@ ed in in the last de@@ ca@@ de or so .
"The world is , in fact , getting more g@@ lob@@ al ."
It &apos;s getting more con@@ nec@@ ted .
M@@ ore of proble@@ ms are g@@ lob@@ al in sc@@ ale .
M@@ ore of our econom@@ ic@@ s is g@@ lob@@ al in sc@@ ale .
And our medi@@ a is less g@@ lob@@ al by the day .
"If you w@@ at@@ ch@@ ed a t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates in the 19@@ 70@@ s , 3@@ 5 to 4@@ 0 percent of it would have been inter@@ na@@ tional ne@@ ws on a ni@@ gh@@ tly new b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st ."
That &apos;s down to about 1@@ 2 to 1@@ 5 percent .
And this ten@@ ds to give us a very di@@ stor@@ ted vi@@ e@@ w of the world .
H@@ ere &apos;s a s@@ li@@ de that A@@ li@@ s@@ a M@@ ill@@ er show@@ ed at a pre@@ vi@@ ous TE@@ D T@@ al@@ k .
A@@ li@@ s@@ a &apos;s the pre@@ si@@ d@@ ent of Pu@@ bli@@ c Ra@@ di@@ o In@@ ter@@ na@@ tional .
"And she made a car@@ to@@ gra@@ m , which is bas@@ ically a di@@ stor@@ ted ma@@ p bas@@ ed on what Am@@ eri@@ can t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion ne@@ ws ca@@ sts loo@@ ked at for a mon@@ th ."
"And you see that when you di@@ stor@@ t a ma@@ p bas@@ ed on at@@ ten@@ tion , the world with@@ in Am@@ eri@@ can t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion ne@@ ws is bas@@ ically re@@ duc@@ ed to this gi@@ ant b@@ lo@@ ated U.@@ S@@ ."
and a cou@@ ple of other coun@@ tries which we &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed .
And that &apos;s bas@@ ically what our medi@@ a is about .
"And before you con@@ cl@@ u@@ de that this is just a f@@ un@@ c@@ tion of Am@@ eri@@ can T@@ V ne@@ ws — which is dre@@ ad@@ ful , and I ag@@ ree that it &apos;s dre@@ ad@@ ful — I &apos;ve been m@@ app@@ ing el@@ ite medi@@ a like the Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es , and I get the same thing ."
"When you look at the Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es , you look at other el@@ ite medi@@ a , what you lar@@ ge@@ ly get are pic@@ tu@@ res of very we@@ al@@ th@@ y na@@ tions and the na@@ tions we &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed ."
It tur@@ ns out that new medi@@ a is@@ n &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly hel@@ p@@ ing us all that much .
H@@ ere &apos;s a ma@@ p made by M@@ ar@@ k G@@ ra@@ ha@@ m who &apos;s down the st@@ re@@ et at the Ox@@ for@@ d In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t In@@ sti@@ tu@@ te .
A this is a ma@@ p of ar@@ ti@@ cl@@ es in Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a that have been ge@@ o-@@ co@@ ded .
And you &apos;ll no@@ ti@@ ce that there &apos;s a very he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ war@@ ds N@@ or@@ th Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a and W@@ est@@ er@@ n Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e .
"E@@ ven with@@ in Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ as , where we &apos;re cre@@ ating their own cont@@ ent on@@ line , there &apos;s a he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ war@@ ds the place where a lot of the Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a au@@ th@@ ors are bas@@ ed , ra@@ ther than to the re@@ st of the world ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , you can get up , you can pic@@ k up your compu@@ ter when you get out of this s@@ es@@ sion , you could re@@ ad a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er from In@@ di@@ a or from Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , from C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , G@@ od for@@ bi@@ d from the U.@@ S@@ ."
You prob@@ ably w@@ on &apos;t .
"If you look at on@@ line medi@@ a con@@ su@@ mp@@ tion — in this ca@@ se , in the to@@ p 10 us@@ ers of the inter@@ ne@@ t — more than 9@@ 5 percent of the ne@@ ws read@@ er@@ shi@@ p is on d@@ om@@ es@@ tic ne@@ ws s@@ it@@ es ."
"It &apos;s one of these r@@ are ca@@ ses where the U.@@ S@@ . is actually s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly better than &#9@@ 1@@ ; the U.@@ K@@ . &#9@@ 3@@ ; , because we actually like read@@ ing your medi@@ a , ra@@ ther than v@@ ice ver@@ s@@ a ."
So all of this star@@ ts le@@ ad@@ ing me to think that we &apos;re in a st@@ ate that I re@@ f@@ er to as ima@@ gin@@ ary c@@ os@@ m@@ op@@ ol@@ it@@ an@@ is@@ m .
We look at the inter@@ ne@@ t .
We think we &apos;re getting this wi@@ de vi@@ e@@ w of the g@@ lo@@ be .
"We oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally st@@ um@@ ble on@@ to a p@@ age in Ch@@ in@@ ese , and we deci@@ de that we do in fact have the gre@@ at@@ est technology ever buil@@ t to con@@ n@@ ect us to the re@@ st of the world ."
And we for@@ get that most of the time we &apos;re ch@@ ec@@ king B@@ os@@ t@@ on R@@ ed So@@ x sc@@ o@@ res .
"So this is a real problem — not just because the R@@ ed So@@ x are ha@@ ving a b@@ ad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re disc@@ us@@ sing here at TE@@ D , the real proble@@ ms in the world the interesting proble@@ ms to sol@@ ve are g@@ lob@@ al in sc@@ ale and sc@@ op@@ e , they re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e g@@ lob@@ al con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions to get to g@@ lob@@ al sol@@ u@@ tions ."
This is a problem we have to sol@@ ve .
So here &apos;s the good ne@@ ws .
"F@@ or si@@ x years , I &apos;ve been h@@ an@@ ging out with these gu@@ ys ."
This is a grou@@ p called G@@ lob@@ al V@@ o@@ ic@@ es .
This is a te@@ am of b@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers from around the world .
Ou@@ r m@@ is@@ sion was to fi@@ x the world &apos;s medi@@ a .
We started in 2@@ 00@@ 4 .
"You might have no@@ tic@@ ed , we ha@@ ven &apos;t done all that well so f@@ ar ."
"N@@ or do I think we are by our@@ selves , actually going to sol@@ ve the problem ."
"But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have lear@@ ned al@@ ong the way are interesting l@@ ess@@ ons for how we would re@@ w@@ ir@@ e if we we wanted to use the we@@ b to have a wi@@ der world ."
The first thing you have to con@@ si@@ der is that there are par@@ ts of the world that are d@@ ar@@ k sp@@ ots in ter@@ ms of at@@ ten@@ tion .
I@@ n this ca@@ se — the ma@@ p of the world at ni@@ ght by N@@ AS@@ A — they &apos;re d@@ ar@@ k lit@@ er@@ ally because of l@@ ack of elec@@ tri@@ city .
And I used to think that a d@@ ar@@ k sp@@ o@@ t on this ma@@ p bas@@ ically me@@ ant you &apos;re not going to get medi@@ a from there because there are more bas@@ ic nee@@ ds .
"Wh@@ at I &apos;m star@@ ting to re@@ aliz@@ e is that you can get medi@@ a , it &apos;s just an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous am@@ oun@@ t of work , and you need an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous am@@ oun@@ t of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ment ."
"O@@ n@@ e of those d@@ ar@@ k sp@@ ots is M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ ca@@ r , a country which is gener@@ ally better kno@@ wn for the D@@ re@@ am@@ wor@@ ks f@@ il@@ m than it is actually kno@@ wn for the lo@@ ve@@ ly people who live there ."
And so the people who f@@ oun@@ ded F@@ ok@@ o Cl@@ u@@ b in M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ ca@@ r w@@ er@@ en &apos;t actually con@@ cer@@ ned with trying to change the ima@@ ge of their country .
They were doing something much si@@ m@@ pl@@ er .
It was a cl@@ u@@ b to lear@@ n En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h and to lear@@ n compu@@ ters and the inter@@ ne@@ t .
but what happened was that M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ ca@@ r went through a vi@@ ol@@ ent cou@@ p .
M@@ ost in@@ de@@ p@@ end@@ ent medi@@ a was sh@@ ut down .
"And the hi@@ gh school stu@@ d@@ ents who were lear@@ ning to b@@ lo@@ g through F@@ ok@@ o Cl@@ u@@ b su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly found the@@ m@@ selves tal@@ king to an inter@@ na@@ tional au@@ di@@ ence about the de@@ mon@@ st@@ ra@@ tions , the vi@@ ol@@ ence , everything that was going on with@@ in this country ."
"So a very , very small pro@@ gra@@ m desig@@ ned to get people in fr@@ on@@ t of compu@@ ters , publi@@ sh@@ ing their own thou@@ gh@@ ts , publi@@ sh@@ ing in@@ de@@ p@@ end@@ ent medi@@ a , en@@ ded up ha@@ ving a hu@@ ge imp@@ act on what we know about this country ."
Now the tri@@ c@@ k with this is that I &apos;m gu@@ ess@@ ing most people here don &apos;t spe@@ a@@ k M@@ al@@ ag@@ as@@ y .
"I &apos;m also gu@@ ess@@ ing that most of you don &apos;t even spe@@ a@@ k Ch@@ in@@ ese — which is sort of sa@@ d if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted l@@ an@@ gu@@ age on the inter@@ ne@@ t ."
F@@ ort@@ un@@ at@@ ely people are trying to fi@@ g@@ ure out how to fi@@ x this .
"If you &apos;re using G@@ oo@@ g@@ le Ch@@ r@@ ome and you go to a Ch@@ in@@ ese l@@ an@@ gu@@ age s@@ ite , you no@@ ti@@ ce this really c@@ ut@@ e bo@@ x at the to@@ p , which au@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ tic@@ ally de@@ t@@ ects that the p@@ age is in Ch@@ in@@ ese and very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly at a m@@ ou@@ se cli@@ c@@ k will give you a tran@@ sl@@ ation of the p@@ age ."
"@@ Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , it &apos;s a m@@ ach@@ ine tran@@ sl@@ ation of the p@@ age ."
"And wh@@ i@@ le G@@ oo@@ g@@ le is very , very good with some l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es , it &apos;s actually pret@@ ty dre@@ ad@@ ful with Ch@@ in@@ ese ."
And the res@@ ul@@ ts can be pret@@ ty f@@ un@@ n@@ y .
"Wh@@ at you really want — what I really want , is ev@@ en@@ tually the ab@@ ility to p@@ us@@ h a bu@@ tt@@ on and have this qu@@ eu@@ ed so a human being can tran@@ sl@@ ate this ."
"And if you think this is ab@@ sur@@ d , it &apos;s not ."
There &apos;s a grou@@ p right now in Ch@@ in@@ a called Ye@@ ey@@ an .
"And Ye@@ ey@@ an is a grou@@ p of 1@@ 50@@ ,000 v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers who get on@@ line every day ."
They look for the most interesting cont@@ ent in the En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h l@@ an@@ gu@@ age .
"They tran@@ sl@@ ate r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly 10@@ 0 ar@@ ti@@ cl@@ es a day from ma@@ j@@ or ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers , ma@@ j@@ or we@@ bs@@ it@@ es ."
They put it on@@ line for f@@ ree .
"It &apos;s the proj@@ ect of a gu@@ y n@@ am@@ ed Zh@@ an@@ g Le@@ i , who was li@@ ving in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates d@@ ur@@ ing the L@@ ha@@ s@@ a ri@@ ots and who cou@@ ldn &apos;t believe how bi@@ as@@ ed Am@@ eri@@ can medi@@ a co@@ ver@@ age was ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I@@ f there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start tran@@ sl@@ ating , so that people between these coun@@ tries start underst@@ an@@ ding each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Ye@@ ey@@ an can line up 1@@ 50@@ ,000 people to tran@@ sl@@ ate the En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h inter@@ ne@@ t into Ch@@ in@@ ese , where &apos;s the En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h l@@ an@@ gu@@ age Ye@@ ey@@ an ?"
"Wh@@ o &apos;s going after Ch@@ in@@ ese , which now has 40@@ 0 million inter@@ ne@@ t us@@ ers out there ?"
M@@ y gu@@ ess is at le@@ ast one of them has something interesting to say .
"So even if we can find a way to tran@@ sl@@ ate from Ch@@ in@@ ese , there &apos;s no gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e that we &apos;re going to find it ."
"When we look for information on@@ line , we bas@@ ically have two str@@ at@@ e@@ gi@@ es ."
We use a lot of sear@@ ch .
And sear@@ ch is ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ c if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
"But if what you &apos;re looking for is ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity , if you want to st@@ um@@ ble on@@ to something that you didn &apos;t know you nee@@ ded , our ma@@ in ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y is to look to our soci@@ al ne@@ t@@ wor@@ ks , to look for our fri@@ en@@ ds ."
What are they looking at ? M@@ ay@@ be we should be looking at it .
The problem with this is that ess@@ enti@@ ally what you end up getting after a wh@@ i@@ le is the w@@ is@@ do@@ m of the f@@ lo@@ c@@ k .
"You end up f@@ lo@@ c@@ king with a lot of people who are prob@@ ably si@@ mil@@ ar to you , who have si@@ mil@@ ar interest@@ s ."
"And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other f@@ lo@@ c@@ ks , from the other par@@ ts of the world where people getting together and tal@@ king about their own interest@@ s ."
"T@@ o do this , at a cer@@ ta@@ in point , you need some@@ one to bu@@ m@@ p you out of your f@@ lo@@ c@@ k and into another f@@ lo@@ c@@ k ."
You need a gu@@ i@@ de .
So this is Am@@ ir@@ a A@@ l H@@ us@@ sa@@ in@@ i . S@@ he is the Mi@@ dd@@ le E@@ ast ed@@ it@@ or for G@@ lob@@ al V@@ o@@ ic@@ es .
S@@ he has one of the h@@ ar@@ d@@ est j@@ ob@@ s in the world .
"N@@ o@@ t only does she have to ke@@ ep our Is@@ ra@@ el@@ i and P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ i@@ an con@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ ors from k@@ ill@@ ing each other , she has to fi@@ g@@ ure out what is going to inter@@ est you about the Mi@@ dd@@ le E@@ ast ."
"And in that sense of trying to get you out of your n@@ or@@ ma@@ l or@@ bit , and to try to get you to p@@ ay at@@ ten@@ tion to a story about some@@ one who &apos;s gi@@ ven up s@@ mo@@ king for the mon@@ th of Ra@@ ma@@ d@@ an , she has to know something about a g@@ lob@@ al au@@ di@@ ence ."
S@@ he has to know something about what stor@@ ies are a@@ va@@ il@@ able .
"B@@ as@@ ically , she &apos;s a de@@ e@@ j@@ ay ."
"S@@ he &apos;s a sk@@ ill@@ ed human cur@@ at@@ or who kno@@ ws what mat@@ eri@@ al is a@@ va@@ il@@ able to her , who &apos;s able to li@@ st@@ en to the au@@ di@@ ence , and who &apos;s able to make a sel@@ ec@@ tion and p@@ us@@ h people for@@ w@@ ard in one f@@ as@@ hi@@ on or another ."
I don &apos;t think this is nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly an al@@ g@@ or@@ i@@ th@@ mi@@ c pro@@ cess .
I think what &apos;s great about the inter@@ ne@@ t is that it actually ma@@ kes it much e@@ as@@ i@@ er for de@@ e@@ j@@ ays to re@@ ach a wi@@ der au@@ di@@ ence .
I know Am@@ ir@@ a .
I can as@@ k her what to re@@ ad .
"But with the inter@@ ne@@ t , she &apos;s in a pos@@ i@@ tion where she can tell a lot of people what to re@@ ad ."
"And you can li@@ st@@ en to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interest@@ ed in ha@@ ving your we@@ b wi@@ d@@ en@@ ed ."
"So on@@ ce you start wi@@ d@@ en@@ ing like this , on@@ ce you start li@@ gh@@ ting up vo@@ ic@@ es in the d@@ ar@@ k sp@@ ots , on@@ ce you start tran@@ sl@@ ating , on@@ ce you start cur@@ ating , you end up in some really we@@ ir@@ d plac@@ es ."
"This is an ima@@ ge from pret@@ ty much my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite b@@ lo@@ g , which is Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get ."
And Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get is a b@@ lo@@ g that loo@@ ks at technology in an Afri@@ c@@ a cont@@ ex@@ t .
"And sp@@ eci@@ f@@ ically , it &apos;s looking at a bl@@ ac@@ k@@ sm@@ ith in K@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ a in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i , who is tur@@ ning the s@@ ha@@ ft of a L@@ and@@ ro@@ ver into a co@@ ld ch@@ i@@ se@@ l ."
"And when you look at this ima@@ ge , you might find y@@ our@@ self going , &quot; Wh@@ y would I con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ ably c@@ are about this ? &quot;"
"And the tr@@ u@@ th is , this gu@@ y can prob@@ ably ex@@ pla@@ in this to you ."
This is E@@ ri@@ k H@@ er@@ s@@ man . You gu@@ ys may have se@@ en him around the con@@ f@@ er@@ ence .
He go@@ es by the mon@@ i@@ k@@ er Wh@@ ite Afri@@ can .
"H@@ e &apos;s bot@@ h a very well kno@@ wn Am@@ eri@@ can ge@@ e@@ k , but he &apos;s also K@@ en@@ y@@ an ; he was bor@@ n in Su@@ d@@ an , gre@@ w up in K@@ en@@ y@@ a ."
He is a b@@ ri@@ d@@ ge fi@@ g@@ ure .
"H@@ e is some@@ one who lit@@ er@@ ally has fe@@ et in bot@@ h wor@@ l@@ ds — one in the world of the Afri@@ can technology comm@@ unity , one in the world of the Am@@ eri@@ can technology comm@@ unity ."
"And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this bl@@ ac@@ k@@ sm@@ ith in K@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ a and tur@@ n it into a story about re@@ p@@ ur@@ pos@@ ing technology , about in@@ no@@ v@@ ating from con@@ st@@ ra@@ int , about looking for in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion bas@@ ed on re@@ using mat@@ eri@@ als ."
"H@@ e kno@@ ws one world , and he &apos;s fin@@ ding a way to comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ te it to another world , bot@@ h of which he has de@@ ep con@@ nec@@ tions to ."
"Th@@ ese b@@ ri@@ d@@ ge fi@@ gu@@ res , I &apos;m pret@@ ty well con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed , are the future of how we try to make the world wi@@ der through using the we@@ b ."
"But the tri@@ c@@ k with b@@ ri@@ d@@ ges is , ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , you need some@@ one to cr@@ oss them ."
And that &apos;s where we start tal@@ king about x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ es .
"So if I found my@@ self in the N@@ F@@ L , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect I would sp@@ end my off@@ -@@ se@@ as@@ on n@@ ur@@ sing my w@@ oun@@ ds , en@@ jo@@ ying my h@@ ou@@ se , so on and so for@@ th — pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly rec@@ or@@ ding a hi@@ p@@ -@@ ho@@ p al@@ bu@@ m ."

That was h@@ il@@ ari@@ ous .
So I gu@@ ess bot@@ h S@@ us@@ an Bo@@ y@@ le and this ve@@ ge@@ t@@ able v@@ end@@ or in Sh@@ an@@ g@@ ha@@ i be@@ l@@ on@@ ged to o@@ ther@@ n@@ ess .
"They were the le@@ ast exp@@ ec@@ ted to be s@@ uc@@ c@@ ess@@ ful in the bus@@ iness called en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment , ye@@ t their cou@@ ra@@ ge and tal@@ ent br@@ ou@@ ght them through ."
And a show and a pl@@ at@@ form ga@@ ve them the st@@ age to re@@ aliz@@ e their dre@@ am@@ s .
"Well , being different is not that diff@@ ic@@ ult ."
We are all different from different per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ves .
"But I think being different is good , because you pres@@ ent a different point of vi@@ e@@ w ."
You may have the chan@@ ce to make a differ@@ ence .
"M@@ y gener@@ ation has been very for@@ t@@ un@@ ate to w@@ it@@ n@@ ess and par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in the hi@@ stor@@ ic tran@@ s@@ formation of Ch@@ in@@ a that has made so many chan@@ ges in the p@@ ast 2@@ 0 , 3@@ 0 years ."
"I re@@ memb@@ er that in the year of 19@@ 9@@ 0 , when I was gra@@ du@@ ating from col@@ le@@ ge , I was ap@@ pl@@ ying for a jo@@ b in the s@@ al@@ es de@@ par@@ t@@ ment of the first fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar h@@ ot@@ el in Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing , G@@ re@@ at W@@ all Sh@@ er@@ at@@ on — it &apos;s still there ."
"So after being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated by this J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese man@@ ag@@ er for a hal@@ f an h@@ our , he fin@@ ally said , &quot; &quot; So , M@@ is@@ s Y@@ an@@ g , do you have any ques@@ tions to as@@ k me ? &quot; &quot; I su@@ m@@ mon@@ ed my cou@@ ra@@ ge and po@@ i@@ se and said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , but could you let me know , what actually do you s@@ ell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a cl@@ ue what a s@@ al@@ es de@@ par@@ t@@ ment was about in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar h@@ ot@@ el ."
That was the first day I se@@ t my f@@ oo@@ t in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar h@@ ot@@ el .
"A@@ r@@ ound the same time , I was going through an au@@ di@@ tion — the first ever op@@ en au@@ di@@ tion by na@@ tional t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion in Ch@@ in@@ a — with another thou@@ s@@ and col@@ le@@ ge g@@ ir@@ l@@ s ."
"The produc@@ er to@@ ld us they were looking for some s@@ we@@ et , in@@ no@@ cent and be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful f@@ res@@ h face ."
"So when it was my tur@@ n , I st@@ ood up and said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ y &#9@@ 1@@ ; do &#9@@ 3@@ ; women &apos;s per@@ s@@ on@@ ali@@ ties on t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion always have to be be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful , s@@ we@@ et , in@@ no@@ cent and , you know , su@@ pp@@ or@@ tive ?"
Wh@@ y can &apos;t they have their own ide@@ as and their own vo@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of off@@ en@@ ded them .
"But actually , they were imp@@ res@@ s@@ ed by my wor@@ ds ."
"And so I was in the second r@@ ound of com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , and then the th@@ ir@@ d and the f@@ our@@ th ."
"A@@ f@@ ter se@@ ven r@@ oun@@ ds of com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , I was the last one to sur@@ vi@@ ve it ."
So I was on a na@@ tional t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion pri@@ me@@ -@@ time show .
"And believe it or not , that was the first show on Ch@@ in@@ ese t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion that al@@ low@@ ed its h@@ os@@ ts to spe@@ a@@ k out of their own min@@ ds with@@ out read@@ ing an ap@@ pro@@ ved sc@@ ri@@ p@@ t ."
( Applause ) And my we@@ e@@ k@@ ly au@@ di@@ ence at that time was between 20@@ 0 to 30@@ 0 million people .
"Well after a few years , I deci@@ ded to go to the U.@@ S@@ . and C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a U@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity to p@@ ur@@ su@@ e my pos@@ t@@ gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ di@@ es , and then started my own medi@@ a comp@@ any , which was un@@ thought of d@@ ur@@ ing the years that I started my car@@ e@@ er ."
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve inter@@ vi@@ ew@@ ed more than a thou@@ s@@ and people in the p@@ ast .
"And some@@ times I have y@@ oun@@ g people ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ing me say , &quot; &quot; L@@ an , you chan@@ ged my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel pr@@ ou@@ d of that ."
But then we are also so for@@ t@@ un@@ ate to w@@ it@@ n@@ ess the tran@@ s@@ formation of the whole country .
I was in Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing &apos;s bi@@ d@@ ding for the Ol@@ y@@ mp@@ ic G@@ am@@ es .
I was re@@ pres@@ en@@ ting the Sh@@ an@@ g@@ ha@@ i Ex@@ p@@ o .
I sa@@ w Ch@@ in@@ a em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing the world and v@@ ice ver@@ s@@ a .
"But then some@@ times I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s y@@ oun@@ g gener@@ ation up to ?"
"H@@ ow are they different , and what are the differ@@ en@@ ces they are going to make to sh@@ ap@@ e the future of Ch@@ in@@ a , or at lar@@ ge , the world ?"
So today I want to talk about y@@ oun@@ g people through the pl@@ at@@ form of soci@@ al medi@@ a .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , who are they ? &#9@@ 1@@ ; What &#9@@ 3@@ ; do they look like ?"
"Well this is a g@@ ir@@ l called Gu@@ o M@@ ei@@ me@@ i — 2@@ 0 years old , be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful ."
"S@@ he show@@ ed off her exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve b@@ ag@@ s , c@@ lo@@ th@@ es and ca@@ r on her m@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ lo@@ g , which is the Ch@@ in@@ ese ver@@ sion of Tw@@ it@@ ter ."
And she cl@@ a@@ im@@ ed to be the gener@@ al man@@ ag@@ er of R@@ ed Cr@@ oss at the C@@ ha@@ mb@@ er of C@@ om@@ m@@ er@@ ce .
"S@@ he didn &apos;t re@@ aliz@@ e that she ste@@ pp@@ ed on a sen@@ si@@ tive n@@ er@@ ve and ar@@ ous@@ ed na@@ tional ques@@ tion@@ ing , al@@ most a tur@@ mo@@ il , aga@@ in@@ st the cre@@ di@@ b@@ ility of R@@ ed Cr@@ oss ."
"The cont@@ ro@@ ver@@ s@@ y was so he@@ ated that the R@@ ed Cr@@ oss had to op@@ en a pres@@ s con@@ f@@ er@@ ence to cl@@ ari@@ f@@ y it , and the inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ation is going on ."
"So f@@ ar , as of today , we know that she h@@ er@@ self made up that ti@@ tle — prob@@ ably because she fe@@ el@@ s pr@@ ou@@ d to be as@@ soci@@ ated with ch@@ ar@@ ity ."
"A@@ ll those exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve it@@ ems were gi@@ ven to her as gi@@ f@@ ts by her bo@@ y@@ fri@@ end , who used to be a bo@@ ard memb@@ er in a su@@ b@@ di@@ vi@@ sion of R@@ ed Cr@@ oss at C@@ ha@@ mb@@ er of C@@ om@@ m@@ er@@ ce ."
It &apos;s very comp@@ li@@ ca@@ ted to ex@@ pla@@ in .
"But any@@ way , the publi@@ c still doesn &apos;t bu@@ y it ."
It is still bo@@ il@@ ing .
"It show@@ s us a gener@@ al mi@@ str@@ ust of gover@@ n@@ ment or gover@@ n@@ m@@ ent@@ -@@ bac@@ ked in@@ sti@@ tu@@ tions , which l@@ ac@@ ked tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy in the p@@ ast ."
And also it show@@ ed us the power and the imp@@ act of soci@@ al medi@@ a as m@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ lo@@ g .
"M@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ lo@@ g bo@@ om@@ ed in the year of 20@@ 10 , with vi@@ s@@ it@@ ors d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed and time sp@@ ent on it tri@@ pl@@ ed ."
"S@@ in@@ a@@ .@@ co@@ m , a ma@@ j@@ or ne@@ ws p@@ ort@@ al , al@@ one has more than 14@@ 0 million m@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers ."
"O@@ n T@@ en@@ cent , 20@@ 0 million ."
"The most p@@ op@@ ular b@@ lo@@ gg@@ er — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a mo@@ vi@@ e st@@ ar , and she has more than 9@@ .@@ 5 million f@@ ol@@ low@@ ers , or f@@ ans ."
"A@@ b@@ out 8@@ 0 percent of those m@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers are y@@ oun@@ g people , und@@ er 3@@ 0 years old ."
"And because , as you know , the tra@@ di@@ tional medi@@ a is still he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly cont@@ ro@@ ll@@ ed by the gover@@ n@@ ment , soci@@ al medi@@ a off@@ ers an op@@ en@@ ing to let the ste@@ am out a little bit ."
"But because you don &apos;t have many other op@@ en@@ ings , the he@@ at coming out of this op@@ en@@ ing is some@@ times very str@@ ong , ac@@ tive and even vi@@ ol@@ ent ."
"So through m@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ lo@@ gg@@ ing , we are able to understand Ch@@ in@@ ese y@@ ou@@ th even better ."
So how are they different ?
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , most of them were bor@@ n in the 80@@ s and 90@@ s , und@@ er the on@@ e-@@ chil@@ d poli@@ cy ."
"And because of sel@@ ec@@ ted ab@@ or@@ tion by fami@@ li@@ es who fa@@ vo@@ red bo@@ ys to g@@ ir@@ l@@ s , now we have en@@ ded up with 3@@ 0 million more y@@ oun@@ g m@@ en than women ."
"That could p@@ ose a p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al d@@ an@@ ger to the soci@@ e@@ ty , but who kno@@ ws ; we &apos;re in a g@@ lob@@ aliz@@ ed world , so they can look for g@@ ir@@ l@@ fri@@ en@@ ds from other coun@@ tries ."
M@@ ost of them have fa@@ ir@@ ly good e@@ du@@ cation .
The il@@ lit@@ er@@ ac@@ y r@@ ate in Ch@@ in@@ a am@@ ong this gener@@ ation is und@@ er one percent .
"In ci@@ ties , 8@@ 0 percent of ki@@ ds go to col@@ le@@ ge ."
"But they are fac@@ ing an ag@@ ing Ch@@ in@@ a with a p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation ab@@ o@@ ve 6@@ 5 years old coming up with se@@ v@@ en@@ -@@ po@@ in@@ t-@@ some percent this year , and about to be 1@@ 5 percent by the year of 20@@ 3@@ 0 ."
"And you know we have the tra@@ di@@ tion that y@@ oun@@ ger gener@@ ations su@@ pp@@ ort the el@@ d@@ ers fin@@ an@@ ci@@ ally , and ta@@ king c@@ are of them when they &apos;re s@@ ic@@ k ."
So it means y@@ oun@@ g cou@@ pl@@ es will have to su@@ pp@@ ort four par@@ ents who have a life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ an@@ cy of 7@@ 3 years old .
So making a li@@ ving is not that e@@ as@@ y for y@@ oun@@ g people .
C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ates are not in sh@@ ort su@@ pp@@ ly .
"In ur@@ b@@ an are@@ as , col@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ates find the star@@ ting s@@ al@@ ary is about 40@@ 0 U.@@ S@@ . doll@@ ars a mon@@ th , wh@@ i@@ le the a@@ ver@@ age r@@ ent is ab@@ o@@ ve $ 50@@ 0 ."
"So what do they do ? They have to sh@@ are space — s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ ed in very li@@ m@@ ited space to sa@@ ve money — and they call the@@ m@@ selves &quot; &quot; tri@@ be of an@@ ts . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get mar@@ ri@@ ed and bu@@ y their ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment , they fi@@ gu@@ red out they have to work for 3@@ 0 to 4@@ 0 years to a@@ ff@@ or@@ d their first ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment ."
"That ra@@ ti@@ o in Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a would only c@@ ost a cou@@ ple fi@@ ve years to ear@@ n , but in Ch@@ in@@ a it &apos;s 3@@ 0 to 4@@ 0 years with the sk@@ y@@ ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ting real est@@ ate pri@@ ce ."
"A@@ m@@ ong the 20@@ 0 million mi@@ gr@@ ant wor@@ k@@ ers , 6@@ 0 percent of them are y@@ oun@@ g people ."
They find the@@ m@@ selves sort of s@@ and@@ w@@ ic@@ h@@ ed between the ur@@ b@@ an are@@ as and the r@@ ur@@ al are@@ as .
"M@@ ost of them don &apos;t want to go back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , but they don &apos;t have the sense of be@@ l@@ on@@ ging ."
"They work for l@@ on@@ ger h@@ our@@ s with less in@@ come , less soci@@ al w@@ el@@ f@@ are ."
"And they &apos;re more v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able to jo@@ b l@@ os@@ ses , su@@ bj@@ ect to in@@ fl@@ ation , ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing lo@@ ans from b@@ an@@ ks , ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of the r@@ en@@ min@@ b@@ i , or d@@ ec@@ line of de@@ m@@ and from Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e or Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a for the produc@@ ts they pro@@ du@@ ce ."
"L@@ ast year , th@@ ough , an app@@ all@@ ing in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent in a s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n O@@ E@@ M man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing comp@@ ound in Ch@@ in@@ a : 1@@ 3 y@@ oun@@ g wor@@ k@@ ers in their l@@ ate te@@ en@@ s and ear@@ ly 20@@ s comm@@ it@@ ted su@@ ici@@ de , just one by one like ca@@ using a cont@@ ag@@ i@@ ous di@@ se@@ ase ."
But they di@@ ed because of all different per@@ s@@ on@@ al reas@@ ons .
"But this whole in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent ar@@ ous@@ ed a hu@@ ge out@@ cr@@ y from soci@@ e@@ ty about the is@@ ol@@ ation , bot@@ h ph@@ y@@ si@@ cal and m@@ ent@@ al , of these mi@@ gr@@ ant wor@@ k@@ ers ."
"F@@ or those who do re@@ tur@@ n back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , they find the@@ m@@ selves very w@@ el@@ come lo@@ c@@ ally , because with the kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge , sk@@ ill@@ s and ne@@ t@@ wor@@ ks they have lear@@ ned in the ci@@ ties , with the as@@ si@@ st@@ ance of the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t , they &apos;re able to create more j@@ ob@@ s , up@@ gra@@ de lo@@ cal ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture and create new bus@@ iness in the less develop@@ ed mar@@ k@@ et ."
"So for the p@@ ast few years , the co@@ a@@ st@@ al are@@ as , they found the@@ m@@ selves in a sh@@ ort@@ age of l@@ ab@@ or ."
Th@@ ese di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms show a more gener@@ al soci@@ al bac@@ k@@ gr@@ ound .
"The first one is the En@@ g@@ el@@ s co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent , which ex@@ pla@@ ins that the c@@ ost of da@@ i@@ ly nec@@ es@@ si@@ ties has d@@ ro@@ pp@@ ed its per@@ c@@ ent@@ age all through the p@@ ast de@@ ca@@ de , in ter@@ ms of fami@@ ly in@@ come , to about 3@@ 7-@@ some percent ."
"But then in the last two years , it go@@ es up again to 3@@ 9 percent , in@@ di@@ ca@@ ting a ri@@ sing li@@ ving c@@ ost ."
The G@@ in@@ i co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent has al@@ ready p@@ as@@ s@@ ed the d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous line of 0@@ .@@ 4 .
Now it &apos;s 0@@ .@@ 5 — even wor@@ se than that in Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a — show@@ ing us the in@@ come in@@ e@@ qu@@ ality .
And so you see this whole soci@@ e@@ ty getting f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated about l@@ os@@ ing some of its mo@@ b@@ ility .
"And also , the b@@ it@@ ter@@ n@@ ess and even res@@ ent@@ ment to@@ war@@ ds the ri@@ ch and the pow@@ er@@ ful is quite wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ."
So any ac@@ c@@ us@@ ations of cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion or bac@@ k@@ do@@ or de@@ al@@ ings between au@@ th@@ or@@ i@@ ties or bus@@ iness would ar@@ ou@@ se a soci@@ al out@@ cr@@ y or even un@@ re@@ st .
"So through some of the h@@ ot@@ t@@ est t@@ op@@ ic@@ s on m@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ lo@@ gg@@ ing , we can see what y@@ oun@@ g people c@@ are most about ."
So@@ ci@@ al j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce and gover@@ n@@ ment ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ab@@ ility r@@ un@@ s the first in what they de@@ m@@ and .
"F@@ or the p@@ ast de@@ ca@@ de or so , a ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve ur@@ b@@ an@@ iz@@ ation and develop@@ ment have let us w@@ it@@ n@@ ess a lot of re@@ p@@ or@@ ts on the for@@ c@@ ed de@@ mo@@ li@@ tion of pri@@ v@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ty ."
And it has ar@@ ous@@ ed hu@@ ge an@@ ger and f@@ ru@@ st@@ ra@@ tion am@@ ong our y@@ oun@@ g gener@@ ation .
"S@@ om@@ e@@ times people get k@@ ill@@ ed , and some@@ times people se@@ t the@@ m@@ selves on fir@@ e to prot@@ est ."
"So when these in@@ ci@@ d@@ ents are re@@ p@@ or@@ ted more and more f@@ re@@ qu@@ ently on the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t , people cr@@ y for the gover@@ n@@ ment to take ac@@ tions to st@@ op this ."
"So the good ne@@ ws is that ear@@ li@@ er this year , the st@@ ate coun@@ ci@@ l p@@ as@@ s@@ ed a new re@@ g@@ ul@@ ation on h@@ ou@@ se re@@ qu@@ i@@ si@@ tion and de@@ mo@@ li@@ tion and p@@ as@@ s@@ ed the right to or@@ der for@@ c@@ ed de@@ mo@@ li@@ tion from lo@@ cal gover@@ n@@ m@@ ents to the cour@@ t ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , many other is@@ su@@ es con@@ cer@@ ning publi@@ c sa@@ fe@@ ty is a ho@@ t t@@ op@@ ic on the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t ."
"We he@@ ard about p@@ oll@@ u@@ ted a@@ ir , p@@ oll@@ u@@ ted water , po@@ is@@ on@@ ed food ."
"And gu@@ ess what , we have fa@@ ked be@@ e@@ f ."
"They have s@@ or@@ ts of in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that you br@@ us@@ h on a piec@@ e of ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en or f@@ ish , and it tur@@ ns it to look like be@@ e@@ f ."
"And then l@@ at@@ ely , people are very con@@ cer@@ ned about c@@ oo@@ king o@@ il , because thou@@ s@@ ands of people have been found &#9@@ 1@@ ; re@@ fin@@ ing &#9@@ 3@@ ; c@@ oo@@ king o@@ il from re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant s@@ lo@@ p ."
So all these things have ar@@ ous@@ ed a hu@@ ge out@@ cr@@ y from the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t .
"And for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , we have se@@ en the gover@@ n@@ ment resp@@ on@@ ding more ti@@ me@@ ly and also more f@@ re@@ qu@@ ently to the publi@@ c con@@ cer@@ ns ."
"W@@ hi@@ le y@@ oun@@ g people see@@ m to be very s@@ ure about their par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation in publi@@ c poli@@ c@@ y-@@ making , but some@@ times they &apos;re a little bit l@@ ost in ter@@ ms of what they want for their per@@ s@@ on@@ al life ."
Ch@@ in@@ a is so@@ on to p@@ as@@ s the U.@@ S@@ .
as the number one mar@@ k@@ et for l@@ u@@ x@@ ur@@ y br@@ ands — that &apos;s not in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding the Ch@@ in@@ ese exp@@ end@@ it@@ u@@ res in Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e and el@@ se@@ where .
"But you know what , hal@@ f of those con@@ su@@ m@@ ers are ear@@ ning a s@@ al@@ ary be@@ low 2@@ ,000 U.@@ S@@ . doll@@ ars ."
They &apos;re not ri@@ ch at all .
They &apos;re ta@@ king those b@@ ag@@ s and c@@ lo@@ th@@ es as a sense of id@@ enti@@ ty and soci@@ al st@@ at@@ us .

"And also , people are doing good through soci@@ al medi@@ a ."

I think we will pl@@ ay another t@@ un@@ e now .
I &apos;m going to do &quot; &quot; L@@ us@@ h Li@@ fe . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite t@@ un@@ es to pl@@ ay .
( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m very for@@ t@@ un@@ ate to be here .
I feel so for@@ t@@ un@@ ate .
I &apos;ve been so imp@@ res@@ s@@ ed by the k@@ in@@ dn@@ ess ex@@ pres@@ s@@ ed to me .
But let me get to the talk — I see the c@@ lo@@ c@@ k is r@@ un@@ ning .
"I &apos;m a publi@@ c school te@@ ac@@ her , and I just want to sh@@ are a story of my su@@ per@@ in@@ ten@@ d@@ ent ."
"H@@ er na@@ me is P@@ am M@@ or@@ an in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty , V@@ ir@@ gin@@ i@@ a , the f@@ oo@@ th@@ ill@@ s of the Bl@@ ue R@@ id@@ ge M@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ."
And she &apos;s a very high@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h su@@ per@@ in@@ ten@@ d@@ ent .
S@@ he &apos;s a technology le@@ ad@@ er and in@@ struc@@ tional le@@ ad@@ er .
"But in her off@@ ice , there &apos;s this old w@@ oo@@ d@@ en , we@@ a@@ ther@@ -@@ wor@@ n t@@ able , k@@ it@@ ch@@ en t@@ able — pe@@ el@@ ing gre@@ en pa@@ int , it &apos;s kind of ri@@ c@@ ke@@ ty ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ am , you &apos;re s@@ uch a mo@@ der@@ n , c@@ ut@@ t@@ ing@@ -@@ ed@@ ge person ."
"Wh@@ y is this old t@@ able in your off@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; And she to@@ ld me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I gre@@ w up in S@@ ou@@ th@@ we@@ st@@ er@@ n V@@ ir@@ gin@@ i@@ a , in the co@@ al min@@ es and the f@@ ar@@ m@@ l@@ ands of r@@ ur@@ al V@@ ir@@ gin@@ i@@ a , and this t@@ able was in my gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther &apos;s k@@ it@@ ch@@ en ."
"And we &apos;d come in from pl@@ ay@@ ing , he &apos;d come in from p@@ low@@ ing and working , and we &apos;d s@@ it around that t@@ able every ni@@ ght ."
"And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21@@ st c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y w@@ is@@ do@@ m t@@ able , really ."
It all started back in 19@@ 7@@ 7 .
"I was a y@@ oun@@ g man , and I had been d@@ ro@@ pp@@ ing in and out of col@@ le@@ ge ."
"And my par@@ ents were very pa@@ ti@@ ent , but I had been doing inter@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ent so@@ j@@ our@@ ns to In@@ di@@ a on a my@@ sti@@ cal qu@@ est ."
So I got a de@@ gre@@ e and it tur@@ ned out to be e@@ du@@ cation .
"And I went in for a jo@@ b inter@@ vi@@ e@@ w in the R@@ ic@@ h@@ mon@@ d Pu@@ bli@@ c S@@ cho@@ ol@@ s in V@@ ir@@ gin@@ i@@ a , the cap@@ it@@ al city , b@@ ou@@ ght a th@@ re@@ e-@@ piec@@ e su@@ it — my con@@ c@@ es@@ sion to con@@ v@@ en@@ tion — ke@@ p@@ t my long be@@ ard and my af@@ r@@ o and my pl@@ at@@ form sh@@ o@@ es — at the time it was the &apos; 70@@ s — and I wal@@ ked in , and I s@@ at down and had an inter@@ vi@@ e@@ w ."
"And I gu@@ ess they were hard up for te@@ ach@@ ers because the su@@ per@@ vi@@ s@@ or , her na@@ me was An@@ n@@ a Ar@@ o , said I had the jo@@ b te@@ ach@@ ing gi@@ f@@ ted children ."
"And I was so sh@@ oc@@ ked , so st@@ un@@ ned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , th@@ ank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Gi@@ f@@ ted e@@ du@@ cation ha@@ dn &apos;t really ta@@ k@@ en ho@@ ld too much ."
There w@@ er@@ en &apos;t really many mat@@ eri@@ als or things to use .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her an@@ sw@@ er sh@@ oc@@ ked me . It st@@ un@@ ned me ."
H@@ er an@@ sw@@ er se@@ t the te@@ m@@ pl@@ ate for the enti@@ re car@@ e@@ er I was to have after that .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question c@@ lear@@ ed the space ."
"There was no pro@@ gra@@ m di@@ rec@@ tive , no man@@ u@@ al to f@@ ol@@ low , no st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds in gi@@ f@@ ted e@@ du@@ cation in that way ."
"And she c@@ lear@@ ed s@@ uch a space that I en@@ de@@ a@@ vo@@ red from then on to c@@ le@@ ar a space for my stu@@ d@@ ents , an e@@ mp@@ ty space , wh@@ er@@ e@@ by they could create and make me@@ an@@ ing out of their own underst@@ an@@ ding ."
"So this happened in 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and I was te@@ ach@@ ing many years l@@ ater , and a fri@@ end of m@@ ine int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed me to a y@@ oun@@ g f@@ il@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ er ."
H@@ is na@@ me is Ch@@ r@@ is F@@ ar@@ in@@ a .
Ch@@ r@@ is F@@ ar@@ in@@ a is here today at his own c@@ ost .
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is , could you st@@ and up and let them see you — a y@@ oun@@ g , vi@@ si@@ on@@ ary f@@ il@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ er who &apos;s made a f@@ il@@ m ."
( Applause ) This f@@ il@@ m is called &quot; &quot; W@@ or@@ ld Pe@@ ace and O@@ ther 4@@ th G@@ ra@@ de A@@ ch@@ i@@ ev@@ em@@ ents . &quot; &quot; He pro@@ pos@@ ed the f@@ il@@ m to me — it &apos;s a great ti@@ tle .
"H@@ e pro@@ pos@@ ed the f@@ il@@ m to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h , maybe it &apos;ll be on lo@@ cal T@@ V , and we can say h@@ i to our fri@@ en@@ ds . &quot; &quot; But the f@@ il@@ m has really g@@ one plac@@ es ."
"Now it &apos;s still in de@@ b@@ t , but Ch@@ r@@ is has man@@ ag@@ ed , through his own s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice , to get this f@@ il@@ m out ."
"So we made a f@@ il@@ m and it tur@@ ns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one te@@ ac@@ her ."
It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a te@@ st@@ am@@ ent to te@@ ach@@ ing and te@@ ach@@ ers .
And it &apos;s a be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful thing .
"And the str@@ an@@ ge thing is , when I w@@ at@@ ch the f@@ il@@ m — I have the e@@ eri@@ e sen@@ sa@@ tion of see@@ ing it — I sa@@ w my@@ self lit@@ er@@ ally dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar ."
What I sa@@ w was my te@@ ach@@ ers coming through me .
"I sa@@ w my ge@@ om@@ e@@ try te@@ ac@@ her in hi@@ gh school , Mr@@ . R@@ uc@@ ell &apos;s wr@@ y s@@ mi@@ le und@@ er his h@@ and@@ le@@ b@@ ar mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he ."
That &apos;s the s@@ mi@@ le I use — that &apos;s his s@@ mi@@ le .
I sa@@ w J@@ an P@@ ol@@ o &apos;s fl@@ as@@ h@@ ing ey@@ es .
"And they w@@ er@@ en &apos;t fl@@ as@@ h@@ ing in an@@ ger , they were fl@@ as@@ h@@ ing in love , in@@ ten@@ se love for her stu@@ d@@ ents ."
And I have that kind of fl@@ as@@ h some@@ times .
And I sa@@ w M@@ is@@ s E@@ the@@ l J@@ . B@@ an@@ ks who wor@@ e pe@@ ar@@ l@@ s and high@@ -@@ he@@ el@@ s to el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school every day .
"And you know , she had that ol@@ d-@@ school te@@ ac@@ her st@@ are ."
You know the one .
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even tal@@ king about you be@@ h@@ ind me , because I &apos;ve got ey@@ es in the back of my he@@ ad . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that te@@ ac@@ her ?"
"I didn &apos;t use that st@@ are very of@@ ten , but I do have it in my re@@ per@@ to@@ ir@@ e ."
And M@@ is@@ s B@@ an@@ ks was there as a great m@@ ent@@ or for me .
"And then I sa@@ w my own par@@ ents , my first te@@ ach@@ ers ."
"M@@ y fa@@ ther , very inv@@ enti@@ ve , sp@@ a@@ ti@@ al thin@@ k@@ er ."
That &apos;s my b@@ ro@@ ther M@@ al@@ col@@ m there on the right .
"And my mo@@ ther , who ta@@ u@@ ght me in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de in se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s in V@@ ir@@ gin@@ i@@ a , who was my in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion ."
"And really , I feel as th@@ ough , when I see the f@@ il@@ m — I have a ge@@ st@@ ure she does , like this — I feel like I am a cont@@ in@@ u@@ ation of her ge@@ st@@ ure ."
I am one of her te@@ ach@@ ing ge@@ stu@@ res .
"And the be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful thing was , I got to te@@ ach my d@@ aughter in el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school , M@@ ad@@ el@@ ine ."
And so that ge@@ st@@ ure of my mo@@ ther &apos;s cont@@ in@@ u@@ es through many gener@@ ations .
It &apos;s an a@@ ma@@ zing fe@@ el@@ ing to have that l@@ in@@ e@@ age .
And so I &apos;m here st@@ an@@ ding on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ ers of many people .
I &apos;m not here al@@ one .
There are many people on this st@@ age right now .
And so this W@@ or@@ ld Pe@@ ace G@@ a@@ me I &apos;d like to tell you about .
"It started out like this : it &apos;s just a f@@ our@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t by fi@@ ve@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t pl@@ y@@ w@@ ood bo@@ ard in an in@@ n@@ er@@ -@@ city ur@@ b@@ an school , 19@@ 7@@ 8 ."
I was cre@@ ating a l@@ ess@@ on for stu@@ d@@ ents on Afri@@ c@@ a .
"We put all the proble@@ ms of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them sol@@ ve it ."
I didn &apos;t want to l@@ ec@@ ture or have just book read@@ ing .
I wanted to have them be im@@ m@@ er@@ s@@ ed and lear@@ n the fe@@ el@@ ing of lear@@ ning through their bo@@ di@@ es .
"So I thought , well they like to pl@@ ay g@@ am@@ es ."
I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say inter@@ ac@@ tive ; we didn &apos;t have that ter@@ m in 19@@ 7@@ 8 — but something inter@@ ac@@ tive .
"And so we made the ga@@ me , and it has s@@ in@@ ce ev@@ ol@@ ved to a f@@ our@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t by f@@ our@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t by f@@ our@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t P@@ le@@ x@@ ig@@ l@@ as@@ s struc@@ ture ."
And it has four P@@ le@@ x@@ ig@@ l@@ as@@ s l@@ ay@@ ers .
There &apos;s an ou@@ ter space l@@ ay@@ er with bl@@ ack h@@ ol@@ es and s@@ at@@ el@@ lit@@ es and re@@ sear@@ ch s@@ at@@ el@@ lit@@ es and a@@ st@@ er@@ o@@ id min@@ ing .
"There &apos;s an a@@ ir and space le@@ vel with cl@@ ou@@ ds that are big pu@@ ff@@ s of c@@ ot@@ t@@ on we p@@ us@@ h around and ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al a@@ ir sp@@ ac@@ es and a@@ ir for@@ ces , a gr@@ ound and se@@ a le@@ vel with thou@@ s@@ ands of ga@@ me piec@@ es on it — even an under@@ se@@ a le@@ vel with su@@ b@@ mar@@ in@@ es and under@@ se@@ a min@@ ing ."
There are four coun@@ tries around the bo@@ ard .
The ki@@ ds make up the n@@ am@@ es of the coun@@ tries — some are ri@@ ch ; some are po@@ or .
"They have different as@@ se@@ ts , comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al and mil@@ it@@ ary ."
And each country has a ca@@ b@@ in@@ et .
"There &apos;s a P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ i@@ ster , S@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of St@@ ate , M@@ in@@ i@@ ster of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se and a C@@ F@@ O , or C@@ om@@ p@@ t@@ ro@@ ll@@ er ."
I cho@@ ose the P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ i@@ ster bas@@ ed on my re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p with them .
"I off@@ er them the jo@@ b , they can tur@@ n it down , and then they cho@@ ose their own ca@@ b@@ in@@ et ."
"There &apos;s a W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank , ar@@ ms de@@ al@@ ers and a Un@@ ited N@@ ations ."
There &apos;s also a we@@ a@@ ther go@@ dd@@ ess who cont@@ ro@@ l@@ s a r@@ an@@ do@@ m st@@ oc@@ k mar@@ k@@ et and r@@ an@@ do@@ m we@@ a@@ ther .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
And then there &apos;s a 1@@ 3-@@ p@@ age cri@@ s@@ is do@@ c@@ um@@ ent with 5@@ 0 inter@@ lo@@ c@@ king proble@@ ms .
"So that , if one thing chan@@ ges , everything el@@ se chan@@ ges ."
"I th@@ ro@@ w them into this comple@@ x mat@@ ri@@ x , and they tr@@ ust me because we have a de@@ ep , ri@@ ch re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p together ."
"And so with all these cri@@ ses , we have — let &apos;s see — e@@ th@@ n@@ ic and min@@ or@@ ity ten@@ si@@ ons ; we have ch@@ em@@ i@@ cal and n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar sp@@ ill@@ s , n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar pro@@ li@@ f@@ er@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s o@@ il sp@@ ill@@ s , en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ent@@ al di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers , water ri@@ gh@@ ts di@@ sp@@ ut@@ es , bre@@ ak@@ away re@@ publi@@ c@@ s , fam@@ ine , end@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ed spec@@ ies and g@@ lob@@ al war@@ m@@ ing ."
"If A@@ l G@@ ore is here , I &apos;m going to s@@ end my f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ d@@ ers from A@@ gn@@ or@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t and V@@ en@@ able sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s to you because they sol@@ ved g@@ lob@@ al war@@ m@@ ing in a we@@ e@@ k ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it se@@ ver@@ al times too . ( Laughter )
"So I also have in the ga@@ me a s@@ ab@@ ot@@ eu@@ r — some chil@@ d — it &apos;s bas@@ ically a tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ k@@ er — and I have my tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ k@@ er put to use because they , on the sur@@ face , are trying to sa@@ ve the world and their pos@@ i@@ tion in the ga@@ me ."
But they &apos;re also trying to under@@ m@@ ine everything in the ga@@ me .
"And they do it sec@@ re@@ tly through m@@ is@@ information and am@@ bi@@ gu@@ i@@ ties and ir@@ re@@ le@@ v@@ an@@ ci@@ es , trying to cause every@@ one to think more de@@ ep@@ ly ."
"The s@@ ab@@ ot@@ eu@@ r is there , and we also re@@ ad from Su@@ n Tz@@ u &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Ar@@ t of W@@ ar . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ d@@ ers understand it — n@@ ine years old — and they h@@ and@@ le that and use that to understand how to , not f@@ ol@@ low — at first they do — the pa@@ ths to power and de@@ struc@@ tion , the p@@ ath to w@@ ar ."
"They lear@@ n to over@@ look sh@@ ort@@ -@@ si@@ gh@@ ted re@@ ac@@ tions and imp@@ ul@@ si@@ ve thinking , to think in a l@@ on@@ g-@@ ter@@ m , more con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al way ."
"S@@ te@@ w@@ art Br@@ and is here , and one of the ide@@ as for this ga@@ me came from him with a Co@@ E@@ v@@ ol@@ ution Qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly ar@@ tic@@ le on a pe@@ ace for@@ ce ."
"And in the ga@@ me , some@@ times stu@@ d@@ ents actually form a pe@@ ace for@@ ce ."
I &apos;m just a c@@ lo@@ c@@ k w@@ at@@ ch@@ er .
I &apos;m just a cl@@ ari@@ fi@@ er . I &apos;m just a fac@@ il@@ it@@ at@@ or .
The stu@@ d@@ ents ru@@ n the ga@@ me .
I have no chan@@ ce to make any poli@@ cy wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever on@@ ce they start pl@@ ay@@ ing .
So I &apos;ll just sh@@ are with you ..@@ .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) Bo@@ y : The W@@ or@@ ld Pe@@ ace G@@ a@@ me is s@@ eri@@ ous .
You &apos;re actually getting ta@@ u@@ ght something like how to take c@@ are of the world .
"S@@ e@@ e , Mr@@ . H@@ un@@ ter is doing that because he sa@@ ys his time has m@@ ess@@ ed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fi@@ x that problem ."
"J@@ o@@ h@@ n H@@ un@@ ter : I off@@ er@@ ed them a — ( Applause ) Ac@@ tually , I can &apos;t tell them any@@ thing because I don &apos;t know the an@@ sw@@ er ."
And I ad@@ m@@ it the tr@@ u@@ th to them right up fr@@ on@@ t : I don &apos;t know .
"And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to di@@ g up the an@@ sw@@ er ."
And so I ap@@ o@@ logi@@ ze to them as well .
"I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so s@@ or@@ ry , bo@@ ys and g@@ ir@@ l@@ s , but the tr@@ u@@ th is we have left this world to you in s@@ uch a sa@@ d and ter@@ ri@@ ble sh@@ ap@@ e , and we hop@@ e you can fi@@ x it for us , and maybe this ga@@ me will help you lear@@ n how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a s@@ in@@ c@@ ere ap@@ o@@ logy , and they take it very s@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly ."
Now you may be w@@ on@@ der@@ ing what all this comple@@ x@@ ity loo@@ ks like .
"Well when we have the ga@@ me start , here &apos;s what you see ."
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) J@@ H : A@@ ll right , we &apos;re going into ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations as of now . G@@ o ."
"( Ch@@ at@@ ter ) J@@ H : M@@ y question to you is , who &apos;s in ch@@ ar@@ ge of that cl@@ as@@ s@@ room ?"
It &apos;s a s@@ eri@@ ous question : who is really in ch@@ ar@@ ge ?
I &apos;ve lear@@ ned to ce@@ de cont@@ ro@@ l of the cl@@ as@@ s@@ room over to the stu@@ d@@ ents over time .
So I &apos;ll just sh@@ are with you some stor@@ ies very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly of some ma@@ gi@@ cal things that have happened .
"In this ga@@ me we had a little g@@ ir@@ l , and she was the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ i@@ ster of the po@@ o@@ re@@ st n@@ ation ."
And the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ i@@ ster — she had the t@@ ank cor@@ ps and A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce and so for@@ th .
"And she was next do@@ or to a very we@@ al@@ th@@ y , o@@ il@@ -@@ ri@@ ch ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ out pro@@ vo@@ cation , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly she at@@ t@@ ac@@ ked , aga@@ in@@ st her P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ i@@ ster &apos;s or@@ d@@ ers , the ne@@ x@@ t-@@ do@@ or ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or &apos;s o@@ il fi@@ el@@ ds ."
"S@@ he mar@@ ch@@ ed into the o@@ il fi@@ el@@ d res@@ er@@ ves , sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded it , with@@ out fir@@ ing a sh@@ o@@ t , and sec@@ u@@ red it and hel@@ d it ."
And that ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or was un@@ able to con@@ duc@@ t any mil@@ it@@ ary op@@ er@@ ations because their fu@@ el su@@ pp@@ ly was lo@@ c@@ ked up .
"We were all up@@ se@@ t with her , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ y are you doing this ?"
"This is the W@@ or@@ ld Pe@@ ace G@@ a@@ me . What is wr@@ ong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little g@@ ir@@ l and , at n@@ ine years old , she hel@@ d her piec@@ es and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; T@@ o her g@@ ir@@ l@@ fri@@ en@@ ds she said that ."
That &apos;s a bre@@ ach there .
"And we lear@@ ned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cr@@ oss a n@@ ine ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old g@@ ir@@ l with t@@ an@@ ks ."
And we were very up@@ se@@ t .
I thought I was fa@@ il@@ ing as a te@@ ac@@ her . Wh@@ y would she do this ?
"But come to find out , a few ga@@ me d@@ ays l@@ ater — and there are tur@@ ns where we take ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation from a te@@ am — actually there &apos;s a ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation per@@ i@@ od with all te@@ am@@ s , and each te@@ am ta@@ kes a tur@@ n , then we go back in ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation , around and around , so each tur@@ n around is one ga@@ me day ."
So a few ga@@ me d@@ ays l@@ ater it came to light that we found out this ma@@ j@@ or country was plan@@ ning a mil@@ it@@ ary off@@ en@@ si@@ ve to d@@ om@@ in@@ ate the enti@@ re world .
"H@@ ad they had their fu@@ el su@@ pp@@ li@@ es , they would have done it ."
S@@ he was able to see the v@@ ec@@ t@@ ors and tr@@ end l@@ in@@ es and in@@ ten@@ tions long before any of us and understand what was going to happ@@ en and made a ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ hi@@ cal deci@@ sion to at@@ t@@ ack in a pe@@ ace ga@@ me .
"Now she used a small w@@ ar to a@@ ver@@ t a lar@@ ger w@@ ar , so we st@@ opp@@ ed and had a very good ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ hi@@ cal disc@@ us@@ sion about whe@@ ther that was right , con@@ di@@ tional good , or not right ."
"That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the s@@ it@@ u@@ ations ."
I could not have desig@@ ned that in te@@ ach@@ ing it .
It came about sp@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous@@ ly through their coll@@ ec@@ tive w@@ is@@ do@@ m .
"( Applause ) A@@ no@@ ther example , a be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful thing happened ."
We have a le@@ tter in the ga@@ me .
"If you &apos;re a mil@@ it@@ ary comm@@ an@@ der and you w@@ age t@@ ro@@ op@@ s — the little pl@@ as@@ tic to@@ ys on the bo@@ ard — and you l@@ ose them , I put in a le@@ tter ."
You have to wr@@ ite a le@@ tter to their par@@ ents — the f@@ ic@@ tional par@@ ents of your f@@ ic@@ tional t@@ ro@@ op@@ s — ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ing what happened and off@@ er@@ ing your con@@ d@@ ol@@ en@@ ces .
So you have a little bit more thought before you comm@@ it to com@@ b@@ at .
"And so we had this s@@ it@@ u@@ ation come up — last su@@ mm@@ er actually , at A@@ gn@@ or@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t S@@ ch@@ ool in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty — and one of our mil@@ it@@ ary comm@@ and@@ ers got up to re@@ ad that le@@ tter and one of the other ki@@ ds said , &quot; &quot; Mr@@ . H@@ un@@ ter , let &apos;s as@@ k — there &apos;s a par@@ ent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a par@@ ent vi@@ s@@ iting that day , just s@@ it@@ ting in the back of the room ."
&quot; &quot; L@@ et &apos;s as@@ k that mo@@ m to re@@ ad the le@@ tter .
"It &apos;ll be more re@@ al@@ er if she re@@ a@@ ds it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we as@@ ked her , and she ga@@ me@@ ly pic@@ ked up the le@@ tter ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ ure . &quot; &quot; S@@ he started read@@ ing . S@@ he re@@ ad one s@@ ent@@ ence .
S@@ he re@@ ad two s@@ ent@@ en@@ ces .
"B@@ y the th@@ ir@@ d s@@ ent@@ ence , she was in te@@ ars ."
I was in te@@ ars .
"E@@ very@@ body underst@@ ood that when we l@@ ose some@@ body , the w@@ in@@ n@@ ers are not g@@ lo@@ ating ."
We all l@@ ose .
And it was an a@@ ma@@ zing oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ence and an a@@ ma@@ zing underst@@ an@@ ding .
I &apos;ll show you what my fri@@ end Da@@ vi@@ d sa@@ ys about this .
He &apos;s been in many b@@ at@@ tl@@ es .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) Da@@ vi@@ d : We &apos;ve really had enough of people at@@ t@@ ac@@ king .
"I mean , we &apos;ve been l@@ uc@@ k@@ y &#9@@ 1@@ ; most of &#9@@ 3@@ ; the time ."
But now I &apos;m fe@@ el@@ ing really we@@ ir@@ d because I &apos;m li@@ ving what Su@@ n Tz@@ u said one we@@ e@@ k .
"O@@ n@@ e we@@ e@@ k he said , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose who go into b@@ at@@ tle and w@@ in will want to go back , and those who l@@ ose in b@@ at@@ tle will want to go back and w@@ in . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been w@@ in@@ ning b@@ at@@ tl@@ es , so I &apos;m going into b@@ at@@ tl@@ es , more b@@ at@@ tl@@ es ."
And I think it &apos;s sort of we@@ ir@@ d to be li@@ ving what Su@@ n Tz@@ u said .
J@@ H : I get ch@@ ill@@ s every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of en@@ g@@ ag@@ ement you want to have happ@@ en .
"And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t pl@@ an that , and I can &apos;t even t@@ est that ."
But it &apos;s sel@@ f-@@ e@@ vi@@ d@@ ent as@@ s@@ es@@ sm@@ ent .
We know that &apos;s an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c as@@ s@@ es@@ sm@@ ent of lear@@ ning .
"We have a lot of data , but I think some@@ times we go be@@ y@@ on@@ d data with the real tr@@ u@@ th of what &apos;s going on ."
So I &apos;ll just sh@@ are a th@@ ir@@ d story .
This is about my fri@@ end Br@@ en@@ n@@ an .
"We had pl@@ ay@@ ed the ga@@ me one s@@ es@@ sion after school for many we@@ e@@ ks , about se@@ ven we@@ e@@ ks , and we had ess@@ enti@@ ally sol@@ ved all 5@@ 0 of the inter@@ lo@@ c@@ king cri@@ ses ."
The way the ga@@ me is w@@ on is all 5@@ 0 proble@@ ms have to be sol@@ ved and every country &apos;s as@@ se@@ t val@@ ue has to be incre@@ as@@ ed ab@@ o@@ ve its star@@ ting point .
"S@@ ome are po@@ or , some are we@@ al@@ th@@ y . There are bil@@ li@@ ons ."
The W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank pre@@ si@@ d@@ ent was a th@@ ir@@ d-@@ gra@@ der one time .
"H@@ e sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; How many z@@ er@@ o@@ s in a tri@@ l@@ lion ? I &apos;ve got to c@@ al@@ cul@@ ate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was se@@ tting f@@ is@@ cal poli@@ cy in that ga@@ me for hi@@ gh school pl@@ ay@@ ers who were pl@@ ay@@ ing with him ."
So the te@@ am that was the po@@ o@@ re@@ st had g@@ ot@@ ten even po@@ o@@ re@@ r .
There was no way they could w@@ in .
"And we were ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ing four o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ c@@ k , our c@@ ut@@ -@@ off time — there was about a min@@ ut@@ e left — and des@@ pa@@ ir just se@@ t@@ tl@@ ed over the room ."
"I thought , I &apos;m fa@@ il@@ ing as a te@@ ac@@ her ."
I should have g@@ ot@@ ten it so they could have w@@ on .
They sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be fa@@ il@@ ing like this .
I &apos;ve fa@@ il@@ ed them .
And I was just fe@@ el@@ ing so sa@@ d and de@@ j@@ ec@@ ted .
"And su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , Br@@ en@@ n@@ an wal@@ ked over to my c@@ ha@@ ir and he gr@@ ab@@ b@@ ed the be@@ ll , the be@@ ll I r@@ ing to si@@ gn@@ al a change or a re@@ con@@ v@@ en@@ ing of ca@@ b@@ in@@ e@@ ts , and he r@@ an back to his se@@ at , r@@ an@@ g the be@@ ll ."
"E@@ very@@ body r@@ an to his c@@ ha@@ ir : there was sc@@ re@@ am@@ ing ; there was y@@ ell@@ ing , wa@@ ving of their d@@ os@@ si@@ ers ."
They get these d@@ os@@ si@@ ers ful@@ l of sec@@ re@@ t do@@ c@@ um@@ ents .
They were g@@ es@@ tic@@ ul@@ ating ; they were r@@ un@@ ning around .
I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d l@@ ost cont@@ ro@@ l of my cl@@ as@@ s@@ room .
"P@@ r@@ in@@ ci@@ p@@ al wal@@ ks in , I &apos;m out of a jo@@ b ."
The par@@ ents were looking in the w@@ in@@ d@@ ow .
And Br@@ en@@ n@@ an r@@ un@@ s back to his se@@ at . E@@ very@@ body r@@ un@@ s back to their se@@ at .
"H@@ e r@@ ings the be@@ ll again . He sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 1@@ 2 secon@@ ds left on the c@@ lo@@ c@@ k — &quot; &quot; we have , all na@@ tions , po@@ ol@@ ed all our f@@ un@@ ds together ."
And we &apos;ve got 60@@ 0 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars .
We &apos;re going to off@@ er it as a d@@ on@@ ation to this po@@ or country .
"And if they ac@@ cep@@ t it , it &apos;ll ra@@ i@@ se their as@@ se@@ t val@@ ue and we can w@@ in the ga@@ me ."
W@@ ill you ac@@ cep@@ t it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three secon@@ ds left on the c@@ lo@@ c@@ k .

"S@@ p@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous comp@@ as@@ sion that could not be plan@@ ned for , that was un@@ exp@@ ec@@ ted and un@@ pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able ."
E@@ very ga@@ me we pl@@ ay is different .
"S@@ ome g@@ am@@ es are more about soci@@ al is@@ su@@ es , some are more about econom@@ ic is@@ su@@ es ."
S@@ ome g@@ am@@ es are more about war@@ f@@ are .
But I don &apos;t try to d@@ en@@ y them that re@@ ality of being human .
"I al@@ low them to go there and , through their own experi@@ ence , lear@@ n , in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ less way , how not to do what they con@@ si@@ der to be the wr@@ ong thing ."
"And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves ."
"And so in this ga@@ me , I &apos;ve lear@@ ned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pic@@ k up a cri@@ tical thinking to@@ o@@ l or cre@@ a@@ tive thinking to@@ o@@ l from this ga@@ me and le@@ ver@@ age something good for the world , they may sa@@ ve us all ."
I@@ f only .
"And on be@@ hal@@ f of all of my te@@ ach@@ ers on wh@@ ose sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ ers I &apos;m st@@ an@@ ding , th@@ ank you . Thank you . Thank you ."
( Applause )
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small to@@ wn k@@ id .
"I don &apos;t know his na@@ me , but I do know his story ."
He li@@ ves in a small v@@ ill@@ age in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ om@@ ali@@ a .
H@@ is v@@ ill@@ age is ne@@ ar Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
Dr@@ ou@@ ght dri@@ ves the small v@@ ill@@ age into po@@ ver@@ ty and to the br@@ in@@ k of star@@ v@@ ation .
"W@@ ith no@@ thing left for him there , he lea@@ ves for the big city , in this ca@@ se , Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , the cap@@ it@@ al of S@@ om@@ ali@@ a ."
"When he ar@@ ri@@ ves , there are no opp@@ ort@@ uni@@ ties , no j@@ ob@@ s , no way for@@ w@@ ard ."
He en@@ ds up li@@ ving in a t@@ ent city on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
"M@@ ay@@ be a year p@@ as@@ ses , no@@ thing ."
"O@@ n@@ e day , he &apos;s ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ed by a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man who off@@ ers to take him to l@@ un@@ ch , then to d@@ in@@ n@@ er , to bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast ."
"H@@ e me@@ e@@ ts this d@@ yn@@ am@@ ic grou@@ p of people , and they give him a bre@@ a@@ k ."
"H@@ e &apos;s gi@@ ven a bit of money to bu@@ y hi@@ m@@ self some new c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , money to s@@ end back home to his fami@@ ly ."
He is int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed to this y@@ oun@@ g wom@@ an .
He ev@@ en@@ tually ge@@ ts mar@@ ri@@ ed .
He star@@ ts this new life .
He has a p@@ ur@@ p@@ ose in life .
"O@@ n@@ e be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful day in Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , und@@ er an a@@ z@@ ure bl@@ ue sk@@ y , a ca@@ r b@@ om@@ b go@@ es off ."
"That small to@@ wn k@@ id with the big city dre@@ am@@ s was the su@@ ici@@ de b@@ om@@ b@@ er , and that d@@ yn@@ am@@ ic grou@@ p of people were al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b , a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist organ@@ iz@@ ation l@@ in@@ ked to al Qa@@ ed@@ a ."
So how does the story of a small to@@ wn k@@ id just trying to make it big in the city end up with him b@@ low@@ ing hi@@ m@@ self up ?
He was wa@@ iting .
"H@@ e was wa@@ iting for an opp@@ ort@@ unity , wa@@ iting to be@@ g@@ in his future , wa@@ iting for a way for@@ w@@ ard , and this was the first thing that came al@@ ong ."
This was the first thing that p@@ ul@@ l@@ ed him out of what we call wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood .
And his story re@@ pe@@ at@@ s it@@ self in ur@@ b@@ an cen@@ ters around the world .
"It is the story of the di@@ sen@@ fr@@ an@@ ch@@ is@@ ed , un@@ e@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed ur@@ b@@ an y@@ ou@@ th who sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ ots in Jo@@ h@@ an@@ n@@ es@@ b@@ ur@@ g , sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ ots in L@@ on@@ don , who re@@ ach@@ es out for something other than wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood ."
"F@@ or y@@ oun@@ g people , the pr@@ om@@ i@@ se of the city , the big city dre@@ am is that of opp@@ ort@@ unity , of j@@ ob@@ s , of we@@ al@@ th , but y@@ oun@@ g people are not sh@@ ar@@ ing in the pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity of their ci@@ ties ."
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s y@@ ou@@ th who su@@ ff@@ er from the high@@ est un@@ e@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment r@@ ates .
"B@@ y 20@@ 3@@ 0 , three out of fi@@ ve people li@@ ving in ci@@ ties will be und@@ er the age of 1@@ 8 ."
"If we do not in@@ cl@@ u@@ de y@@ oun@@ g people in the gro@@ w@@ th of our ci@@ ties , if we do not pro@@ vi@@ de them opp@@ ort@@ uni@@ ties , the story of wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood , the g@@ at@@ e@@ way to ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m , to vi@@ ol@@ ence , to g@@ an@@ gs , will be the story of ci@@ ties 2.@@ 0 ."
"And in my city of b@@ ir@@ th , Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , 7@@ 0 percent of y@@ oun@@ g people su@@ ff@@ er from un@@ e@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ."
"@@ 7@@ 0 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school ."
They pret@@ ty much do no@@ thing .
"I went back to Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u last mon@@ th , and I went to vi@@ s@@ it M@@ ad@@ in@@ a H@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al , the h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al I was bor@@ n in ."
"I re@@ memb@@ er st@@ an@@ ding in fr@@ on@@ t of that b@@ ul@@ le@@ t-@@ ri@@ dd@@ en h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al thinking , what if I had never left ?"
What if I had been for@@ c@@ ed into that same st@@ ate of wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood ?
W@@ ould I have become a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist ?
I &apos;m not really s@@ ure about the an@@ sw@@ er .
M@@ y reas@@ on for being in Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u that mon@@ th was actually to h@@ ost a y@@ ou@@ th le@@ ad@@ er@@ shi@@ p and ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ shi@@ p su@@ mm@@ it .
I br@@ ou@@ ght together about 9@@ 0 y@@ oun@@ g S@@ om@@ al@@ i le@@ ad@@ ers .
We s@@ at down and bra@@ in@@ stor@@ m@@ ed on sol@@ u@@ tions to the bi@@ gg@@ est ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges fac@@ ing their city .
On@@ e of the y@@ oun@@ g m@@ en in the room was Ad@@ en .
"H@@ e went to uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity in Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , gra@@ du@@ ated ."
"There were no j@@ ob@@ s , no opp@@ ort@@ uni@@ ties ."
"I re@@ memb@@ er him t@@ ell@@ ing me , because he was a col@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ate , un@@ e@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed , f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated , that he was the per@@ f@@ ect t@@ ar@@ get for al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b and other ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist organ@@ iz@@ ations , to be rec@@ ru@@ ited ."
They s@@ ou@@ ght people like him out .
But his story ta@@ kes a different r@@ ou@@ te .
"In Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , the bi@@ gg@@ est b@@ ar@@ ri@@ er to getting from point A to point B are the ro@@ a@@ ds ."
"T@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ three years of ci@@ vi@@ l w@@ ar have comple@@ tely de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed the ro@@ ad system , and a m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke can be the e@@ as@@ i@@ est way to get around ."
Ad@@ en sa@@ w an opp@@ ort@@ unity and se@@ iz@@ ed it .
He started a m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke comp@@ any .
He be@@ g@@ an r@@ en@@ ting out m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ kes to lo@@ cal re@@ si@@ d@@ ents who cou@@ ldn &apos;t n@@ or@@ m@@ ally a@@ ff@@ or@@ d them .
"H@@ e b@@ ou@@ ght 10 bi@@ kes , with the help of fami@@ ly and fri@@ en@@ ds , and his dre@@ am is to ev@@ en@@ tually exp@@ and to se@@ ver@@ al h@@ und@@ red with@@ in the next three years ."
How is this story different ?
What ma@@ kes his story different ?
I believe it is his ab@@ ility to id@@ enti@@ f@@ y and se@@ iz@@ e a new opp@@ ort@@ unity .
"It &apos;s ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ shi@@ p , and I believe ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ shi@@ p can be the most pow@@ er@@ ful to@@ o@@ l aga@@ in@@ st wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood ."
It e@@ mp@@ ow@@ ers y@@ oun@@ g people to be the cre@@ at@@ ors of the very econom@@ ic opp@@ ort@@ uni@@ ties they are so des@@ per@@ at@@ ely see@@ king .
And you can tra@@ in y@@ oun@@ g people to be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s .
"I want to talk to you about a y@@ oun@@ g man who at@@ ten@@ ded one of my me@@ et@@ ings , Mo@@ ha@@ m@@ ed Mo@@ ha@@ m@@ ou@@ d , a fl@@ or@@ ist ."
He was hel@@ p@@ ing me tra@@ in some of the y@@ oun@@ g people at the su@@ mm@@ it in ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ shi@@ p and how to be in@@ no@@ va@@ tive and how to create a cul@@ ture of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ shi@@ p .
"H@@ e &apos;s actually the first fl@@ or@@ ist Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u has se@@ en in over 2@@ 2 years , and un@@ ti@@ l rec@@ ently , un@@ ti@@ l Mo@@ ha@@ m@@ ed came al@@ ong , if you wanted f@@ low@@ ers at your we@@ d@@ ding , you used pl@@ as@@ tic b@@ ou@@ qu@@ e@@ ts shi@@ pp@@ ed from ab@@ ro@@ ad ."
"If you as@@ ked some@@ one , &quot; Wh@@ en was the last time you sa@@ w f@@ res@@ h f@@ low@@ ers ? &quot;"
"@@ for many who gre@@ w up und@@ er ci@@ vi@@ l w@@ ar , the an@@ sw@@ er would be , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever . &quot; &quot; So Mo@@ ha@@ m@@ ed sa@@ w an opp@@ ort@@ unity ."
He started a l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ ing and design fl@@ or@@ al comp@@ any .
"H@@ e cre@@ ated a f@@ ar@@ m right out@@ side of Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , and started gro@@ w@@ ing tu@@ li@@ ps and li@@ li@@ es , which he said could sur@@ vi@@ ve the h@@ ar@@ s@@ h Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u cli@@ m@@ ate ."
"And he be@@ g@@ an de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing f@@ low@@ ers to we@@ dd@@ ings , cre@@ ating g@@ ar@@ d@@ en@@ s at h@@ om@@ es and bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es around the city , and he &apos;s now working on cre@@ ating Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u &apos;s first publi@@ c par@@ k in 2@@ 2 years ."
There &apos;s no publi@@ c par@@ k in Mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
"H@@ e wan@@ ts to create a space where fami@@ li@@ es , y@@ oun@@ g people , can come together , and , as he sa@@ ys , sm@@ ell the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al r@@ os@@ es ."
"And he doesn &apos;t gro@@ w r@@ os@@ es because they use too much water , by the way ."
"So the first ste@@ p is to in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e y@@ oun@@ g people , and in that room , Mo@@ ha@@ m@@ ed &apos;s pres@@ ence had a really pro@@ found imp@@ act on the y@@ ou@@ th in that room ."
They had never really thought about star@@ ting up a bus@@ iness .
"They &apos;ve thought about working for an N@@ G@@ O , working for the gover@@ n@@ ment , but his story , his in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , really had a str@@ ong imp@@ act on them ."
He for@@ c@@ ed them to look at their city as a place of opp@@ ort@@ unity .
"H@@ e e@@ mp@@ ow@@ er@@ ed them to believe that they could be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s , that they could be change ma@@ k@@ ers ."
"B@@ y the end of the day , they were coming up with in@@ no@@ va@@ tive sol@@ u@@ tions to some of the bi@@ gg@@ est ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges fac@@ ing their city ."
They came up with ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eu@@ ri@@ al sol@@ u@@ tions to lo@@ cal proble@@ ms .
"So in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing y@@ oun@@ g people and cre@@ ating a cul@@ ture of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ shi@@ p is a really great ste@@ p , but y@@ oun@@ g people need cap@@ it@@ al to make their ide@@ as a re@@ ality ."
They need exper@@ ti@@ se and m@@ ent@@ or@@ shi@@ p to gu@@ i@@ de them in develop@@ ing and la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing their bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es .
"C@@ on@@ n@@ ect y@@ oun@@ g people with the res@@ our@@ ces they need , pro@@ vi@@ de them the su@@ pp@@ ort they need to go from ide@@ ation to cre@@ ation , and you will create ca@@ tal@@ y@@ sts for ur@@ b@@ an gro@@ w@@ th ."
"F@@ or me , ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ shi@@ p is more than just star@@ ting up a bus@@ iness ."
It &apos;s about cre@@ ating a soci@@ al imp@@ act .
Mo@@ ha@@ m@@ ed is not si@@ mp@@ ly sel@@ l@@ ing f@@ low@@ ers .
I believe he is sel@@ l@@ ing hop@@ e .
"H@@ is Pe@@ ace P@@ ar@@ k , and that &apos;s what he call@@ s it , when it &apos;s cre@@ ated , will actually tran@@ s@@ form the way people see their city ."
Ad@@ en hi@@ red st@@ re@@ et ki@@ ds to help r@@ ent out and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in those bi@@ kes for him .
He ga@@ ve them the opp@@ ort@@ unity to es@@ cap@@ e the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is of wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood .
Th@@ ese y@@ oun@@ g ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s are ha@@ ving a tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous imp@@ act in their ci@@ ties .
"So my su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion is , tur@@ n y@@ ou@@ th into ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s , in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate and n@@ ur@@ ture their in@@ h@@ er@@ ent in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , and you will have more stor@@ ies of f@@ low@@ ers and Pe@@ ace P@@ ar@@ ks than of ca@@ r b@@ om@@ b@@ s and wa@@ i@@ th@@ ood ."
Thank you .

"O@@ k@@ ay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to pl@@ ay ."
I w@@ on &apos;t be able to tell you what it is un@@ ti@@ l it happen@@ s .
I didn &apos;t re@@ aliz@@ e there was going to be a little mus@@ ic before .

"So the b@@ and@@ st@@ and , as we call it , this is an incre@@ di@@ ble space ."
It is really a s@@ ac@@ red space .
"And one of the things that is really s@@ ac@@ red about it is that you have no opp@@ ort@@ unity to think about the future , or the p@@ ast ."
You really are ali@@ ve right here in this mom@@ ent .
There are so many deci@@ si@@ ons being made when you wal@@ k on the b@@ and@@ st@@ and .
We had no idea what k@@ ey we were going to pl@@ ay in .
"In the mi@@ dd@@ le , we sort of made our way into a s@@ ong called &quot; &quot; T@@ it@@ i B@@ oo@@ m . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not ."
E@@ very@@ one &apos;s li@@ st@@ en@@ ing . We &apos;re resp@@ on@@ ding .
You have no time for proj@@ ec@@ ted ide@@ as .
"So the idea of a mi@@ sta@@ ke : F@@ rom the per@@ spec@@ tive of a ja@@ z@@ z mus@@ ici@@ an , it &apos;s e@@ as@@ i@@ er to talk about some@@ one el@@ se &apos;s mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
"So the way I per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve a mi@@ sta@@ ke when I &apos;m on the b@@ and@@ st@@ and — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
The only mi@@ sta@@ ke li@@ es in that I &apos;m not able to per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve what it is that some@@ one el@@ se did .
E@@ very &quot; &quot; mi@@ sta@@ ke &quot; &quot; is an opp@@ ort@@ unity in ja@@ z@@ z .
So it &apos;s hard to even des@@ cri@@ be what a f@@ un@@ n@@ y n@@ ot@@ e would be .
"So for example , if I pl@@ ay@@ ed a col@@ or , like we were pl@@ ay@@ ing on a p@@ al@@ et@@ te , that s@@ oun@@ ded like this ..@@ ."
( M@@ us@@ ic ) So if Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an pl@@ ay@@ ed a n@@ ot@@ e — like pl@@ ay an F@@ . ( M@@ us@@ ic )
"S@@ e@@ e , these are all right in@@ side of the col@@ or p@@ al@@ et@@ te ."
I@@ f you pl@@ ay@@ ed an E@@ .
"S@@ e@@ e , these all li@@ e right in@@ side of this gener@@ al e@@ mo@@ tional p@@ al@@ et@@ te that we were pa@@ in@@ ting ."
"If you pl@@ ay@@ ed an F # th@@ ough , ( D@@ is@@ s@@ on@@ ance ) to most people &apos;s e@@ ars , they would per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve that as a mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
"So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to pl@@ ay just for a second ."
And we &apos;re going to pl@@ ay on this p@@ al@@ et@@ te .
"And at some point , Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an will int@@ ro@@ du@@ ce this n@@ ot@@ e ."
And we w@@ on &apos;t re@@ act to it .
"H@@ e &apos;ll int@@ ro@@ du@@ ce it for a second and then I &apos;ll st@@ op , I &apos;ll talk for a second ."
We &apos;ll see what happen@@ s when we pl@@ ay with this p@@ al@@ et@@ te .
( M@@ us@@ ic ) So some@@ one could con@@ cep@@ tually per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve that as a mi@@ sta@@ ke .
The only way that I would say it was a mi@@ sta@@ ke is in that we didn &apos;t re@@ act to it .
It was an opp@@ ort@@ unity that was m@@ is@@ s@@ ed .
So it &apos;s un@@ pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able . We &apos;ll pa@@ int this p@@ al@@ et@@ te again .
"H@@ e &apos;ll pl@@ ay it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll re@@ act to it , but something will change ."
"We &apos;ll all ac@@ cep@@ t his ide@@ as , or not ."
"( M@@ us@@ ic ) So you see , he pl@@ ay@@ ed this n@@ ot@@ e ."
I en@@ ded up cre@@ ating a m@@ el@@ o@@ dy out of it .
The t@@ ex@@ ture chan@@ ged in the dr@@ um@@ s this time .
"It got a little bit more r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ c , a little bit more in@@ ten@@ se in resp@@ on@@ se to how I resp@@ on@@ ded to it ."
So there is no mi@@ sta@@ ke .
"The only mi@@ sta@@ ke is if I &apos;m not aw@@ are , if each in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al mus@@ ici@@ an is not aw@@ are and ac@@ cep@@ ting enough of his f@@ el@@ low b@@ and memb@@ er to in@@ cor@@ p@@ or@@ ate the idea and we don &apos;t al@@ low for cre@@ a@@ tiv@@ ity ."
"So ja@@ z@@ z , this b@@ and@@ st@@ and is ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tely a@@ ma@@ zing ."
It &apos;s a very pu@@ ri@@ f@@ ying experi@@ ence .
And I know that I spe@@ a@@ k for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for gr@@ an@@ ted .
We know that to be able to come on the b@@ and@@ st@@ and and pl@@ ay mus@@ ic is a bl@@ ess@@ ing .
So how does this all re@@ l@@ ate to be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or@@ al fin@@ ance ?
"Well we &apos;re ja@@ z@@ z mus@@ ici@@ ans , so st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ ically we don &apos;t have a great re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p to fin@@ ance ."
"( Laughter ) An@@ y@@ way , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we h@@ and@@ le it ."
And the other d@@ yn@@ am@@ ic of it is that we don &apos;t m@@ ic@@ r@@ om@@ an@@ age in ja@@ z@@ z .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually li@@ m@@ its the ar@@ ti@@ sti@@ c pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties .
"If I come up and I di@@ ct@@ ate to the b@@ and that I want to pl@@ ay like this and I want the mus@@ ic to go this way , and I just j@@ um@@ p right in ..@@ ."
"@@ ready , just pl@@ ay some time ."
"O@@ n@@ e , two , one , two , three , four ."
( M@@ us@@ ic ) It &apos;s kind of c@@ ha@@ o@@ tic because I &apos;m b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying my ide@@ as .
"I &apos;m t@@ ell@@ ing them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; I@@ f I really want the mus@@ ic to go there , the best way for me to do it is to li@@ st@@ en ."
This is a sci@@ ence of li@@ st@@ en@@ ing .
It has f@@ ar more to do with what I can per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve than what it is that I can do .
"So if I want the mus@@ ic to get to a cer@@ ta@@ in le@@ vel of in@@ ten@@ s@@ ity , the first ste@@ p for me is to be pa@@ ti@@ ent , to li@@ st@@ en to what &apos;s going on and p@@ ul@@ l from something that &apos;s going on around me ."
"When you do that , you en@@ g@@ age and in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e the other mus@@ ici@@ ans and they give you more , and gra@@ du@@ ally it buil@@ ds ."
"W@@ at@@ ch . On@@ e , two , a one , two , three , four ."
( M@@ us@@ ic ) T@@ ot@@ ally different experi@@ ence when I &apos;m p@@ ul@@ l@@ ing ide@@ as .
It &apos;s much more organ@@ ic . It &apos;s much more nu@@ an@@ c@@ ed .
It &apos;s not about b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying my vi@@ sion or any@@ thing like that .
"It &apos;s about being here in the mom@@ ent , ac@@ cep@@ ting one another and al@@ low@@ ing cre@@ a@@ tiv@@ ity to f@@ low ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Applause ) On@@ e of the real ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges is to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ ally in e@@ du@@ cation .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ thr@@ all@@ ed to in e@@ du@@ cation ."
This one te@@ ac@@ her didn &apos;t take it s@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly .
"I want to say that really and tr@@ u@@ ly , after these incre@@ di@@ ble spe@@ ech@@ es and ide@@ as that are being sp@@ re@@ ad , I am in the aw@@ k@@ w@@ ard pos@@ i@@ tion of being here to talk to you today about t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion ."

The a@@ ver@@ age Am@@ eri@@ can w@@ at@@ ch@@ es T@@ V for al@@ most 5 h@@ our@@ s a day .
Ok@@ ay ?
"Now I happ@@ en to make my li@@ ving these d@@ ays in t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing ."
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .

"They call it stu@@ p@@ id , and wor@@ se , believe me ."
"M@@ y mo@@ ther , gro@@ w@@ ing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; i@@ di@@ o@@ t bo@@ x . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to de@@ b@@ ate whe@@ ther there &apos;s s@@ uch a thing as good T@@ V or b@@ ad T@@ V ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion has a con@@ sci@@ ence ."
"So why I believe that t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion has a con@@ sci@@ ence is that I actually believe that t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion di@@ rec@@ tly re@@ fl@@ ects the mor@@ al , poli@@ tical , soci@@ al and e@@ mo@@ tional need st@@ ates of our n@@ ation — that t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion is how we actually dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate our enti@@ re val@@ ue system ."
"So all these things are uni@@ qu@@ ely human , and they all ad@@ d up to our idea of con@@ sci@@ ence ."
"Now today , we &apos;re not tal@@ king about good and b@@ ad T@@ V ."
We &apos;re tal@@ king about p@@ op@@ ular T@@ V .
We &apos;re tal@@ king about t@@ op@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated show@@ s over the course of 5@@ 0 years .
"H@@ ow do these N@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ en r@@ at@@ ings re@@ fl@@ ect not just what you &apos;ve he@@ ard about , which is the idea of our soci@@ al , coll@@ ec@@ tive un@@ con@@ sci@@ ous , but how do these t@@ op@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated show@@ s over 5@@ 0 years re@@ fl@@ ect the idea of our soci@@ al con@@ sci@@ ence ?"
"H@@ ow does t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion ev@@ ol@@ ve over time , and what does this say about our soci@@ e@@ ty ?"
"Now spe@@ a@@ king of ev@@ ol@@ ution , from bas@@ ic bi@@ o@@ logy , you prob@@ ably re@@ memb@@ er that the an@@ ima@@ l k@@ ing@@ do@@ m , in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding hum@@ ans , have four bas@@ ic pri@@ ma@@ l in@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ ts ."
You have h@@ un@@ ger ; you have se@@ x ; you have power ; and you have the ur@@ ge for ac@@ qu@@ i@@ si@@ tiv@@ en@@ ess .
"A@@ s hum@@ ans , what &apos;s important to re@@ memb@@ er is that we &apos;ve develop@@ ed , we &apos;ve ev@@ ol@@ ved over time to te@@ mp@@ er , or ta@@ me , these bas@@ ic an@@ ima@@ l in@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ ts ."
We have the cap@@ ac@@ ity to l@@ au@@ gh and cr@@ y .
"We feel a@@ we , we feel p@@ ity ."
That is se@@ par@@ ate and ap@@ art from the an@@ ima@@ l k@@ ing@@ do@@ m .
The other thing about human be@@ ings is that we love to be en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ed .
We love to w@@ at@@ ch T@@ V .
This is something that c@@ lear@@ ly se@@ par@@ ates us from the an@@ ima@@ l k@@ ing@@ do@@ m .
"A@@ n@@ im@@ als might love to pl@@ ay , but they don &apos;t love to w@@ at@@ ch ."
So I had an am@@ bi@@ tion to disc@@ over what could be underst@@ ood from this uni@@ qu@@ ely human re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p between t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion pro@@ gra@@ ms and the human con@@ sci@@ ous .
Wh@@ y has t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment ev@@ ol@@ ved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this car@@ to@@ on de@@ vi@@ l or an@@ ge@@ l s@@ it@@ ting on our sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ ers .
"I@@ s t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion lit@@ er@@ ally f@@ un@@ c@@ tion@@ ing as our con@@ sci@@ ence , te@@ mp@@ ting us and re@@ war@@ ding us at the same time ?"
"So to be@@ g@@ in to an@@ sw@@ er these ques@@ tions , we did a re@@ sear@@ ch stu@@ dy ."
We went back 5@@ 0 years to the 19@@ 5@@ 9 / 19@@ 6@@ 0 t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion se@@ as@@ on .
We sur@@ ve@@ y@@ ed the t@@ op@@ -@@ 2@@ 0 N@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ en show@@ s every year for 5@@ 0 years — a thou@@ s@@ and show@@ s .
"We tal@@ ked to over 3@@ ,000 in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als — al@@ most 3,@@ 60@@ 0 — ag@@ ed 1@@ 8 to 7@@ 0 , and we as@@ ked them how they f@@ el@@ t e@@ mo@@ tion@@ ally ."
How did you feel w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing every sing@@ le one of these show@@ s ?
D@@ id you feel a sense of mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity ?
D@@ id you feel ou@@ tra@@ ge ? D@@ id you l@@ au@@ gh ?
What did this mean for you ?
"So to our g@@ lob@@ al TE@@ D au@@ di@@ en@@ ces , I want to say that this was a U.@@ S@@ . sa@@ mple ."
"But as you can see , these e@@ mo@@ tional need st@@ ates are tr@@ u@@ ly uni@@ ver@@ s@@ al ."
"And on a fac@@ tu@@ al bas@@ is , over 8@@ 0 percent of the U.@@ S@@ . &apos; s most p@@ op@@ ular show@@ s are exp@@ or@@ ted around the world ."
So I really hop@@ e our g@@ lob@@ al au@@ di@@ en@@ ces can re@@ l@@ ate .
"T@@ w@@ o ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ gm@@ ents before our first data s@@ li@@ de : F@@ or in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing me to even think about the idea of con@@ sci@@ ence and the tri@@ c@@ ks that con@@ sci@@ ence can pl@@ ay on us on a da@@ i@@ ly bas@@ is , I th@@ ank le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary r@@ ab@@ b@@ i , J@@ ack S@@ ter@@ n ."
"And for the way in which I &apos;m going to pres@@ ent the data , I want to th@@ ank TE@@ D comm@@ unity su@@ per@@ st@@ ar H@@ ans R@@ os@@ l@@ ing , who you may have just se@@ en ."
"O@@ k@@ ay , here we go ."
"So here you see , from 19@@ 6@@ 0 to 20@@ 10 , the 5@@ 0 years of our stu@@ dy ."
"T@@ w@@ o things we &apos;re going to start with — the in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion st@@ ate and the mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity st@@ ate , which , for this p@@ ur@@ p@@ ose , we de@@ fin@@ ed in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion as t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion show@@ s that up@@ li@@ ft me , that make me feel much more pos@@ i@@ tive about the world ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity are t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ si@@ ons show@@ s in which I don &apos;t understand the differ@@ ence between right and wr@@ ong .
"A@@ s we start , you see in 19@@ 6@@ 0 in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion is h@@ ol@@ ding ste@@ ad@@ y ."
That &apos;s what we &apos;re w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing T@@ V for .
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity star@@ ts to cli@@ m@@ b .
"@@ Ri@@ ght at the end of the 60@@ s , mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity is going up , in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion is kind of on the wan@@ e ."
Wh@@ y ?
"The Cu@@ b@@ an M@@ is@@ si@@ le C@@ ri@@ s@@ is , J@@ F@@ K is sh@@ o@@ t , the Ci@@ vi@@ l Ri@@ gh@@ ts mo@@ v@@ ement , r@@ ace ri@@ ots , the V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ m W@@ ar , M@@ L@@ K is sh@@ o@@ t , B@@ ob@@ by K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy is sh@@ o@@ t , W@@ at@@ er@@ g@@ ate ."
L@@ oo@@ k what happen@@ s .
"In 19@@ 7@@ 0 , in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion pl@@ um@@ me@@ ts ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity ta@@ kes off .
"They cr@@ oss , but R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an , a t@@ el@@ e@@ gen@@ ic pre@@ si@@ d@@ ent , is in off@@ ice ."
It &apos;s trying to re@@ co@@ ver .
"But look , it can &apos;t : A@@ ID@@ S , Ir@@ an@@ -@@ C@@ on@@ tr@@ a , the Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ger di@@ sa@@ ster , Ch@@ er@@ no@@ by@@ l ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity be@@ comes the d@@ om@@ in@@ ant me@@ me in t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion from 19@@ 9@@ 0 for the next 2@@ 0 years .
Ta@@ ke a look at this .
This ch@@ art is going to do@@ c@@ um@@ ent a very si@@ mil@@ ar tr@@ end .
"But in this ca@@ se , we have com@@ for@@ t — the bu@@ b@@ ble in red — soci@@ al comm@@ ent@@ ary and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence in bl@@ ue and gre@@ en ."
"Now this time on T@@ V you have &quot; &quot; B@@ on@@ an@@ z@@ a , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t for@@ get , you have &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith , &quot; &quot; you have d@@ om@@ es@@ tic show@@ s all about com@@ for@@ t ."
This is ri@@ sing . C@@ om@@ for@@ t st@@ ays whole .
Ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence star@@ ts to ri@@ se .
So@@ ci@@ al comm@@ ent@@ ary is all of a su@@ dd@@ en sp@@ i@@ king up .
"You get to 19@@ 6@@ 9 , and look what happen@@ s ."
"You have com@@ for@@ t , ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence , and soci@@ al comm@@ ent@@ ary , not only b@@ at@@ tl@@ ing it out in our soci@@ e@@ ty , but you lit@@ er@@ ally have two est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment show@@ s — &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; G@@ om@@ er Py@@ le &quot; &quot; — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 are the numb@@ er@@ -@@ tw@@ o@@ - and numb@@ er@@ -@@ th@@ re@@ e-@@ r@@ ated t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion show@@ s ."
What &apos;s number one ?
"The soci@@ ally ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent hi@@ p@@ pi@@ e show , &quot; R@@ ow@@ an and M@@ ar@@ ti@@ n &apos;s L@@ augh@@ -@@ I@@ n . &quot;"
"They &apos;re all li@@ ving together , right ."
V@@ i@@ ew@@ ers had resp@@ on@@ ded d@@ ra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally .
L@@ oo@@ k at this gre@@ en sp@@ i@@ ke in 19@@ 6@@ 6 to a be@@ ll@@ we@@ ther show .
"When you gu@@ ys he@@ ar this in@@ du@@ str@@ y ter@@ m , a bre@@ ak@@ out h@@ it , what does that mean ?"
"It means in the 19@@ 6@@ 6 t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion se@@ as@@ on , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mo@@ th@@ ers B@@ ro@@ th@@ ers &quot; &quot; came out of no@@ where ."
"This was the first show that al@@ low@@ ed vi@@ ew@@ ers to say , &quot; &quot; M@@ y G@@ od , I can com@@ ment on how I feel about the V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ m W@@ ar , about the pre@@ si@@ d@@ en@@ cy , through t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a bre@@ ak@@ out show ."
"So then , just like the last ch@@ art , look what happen@@ s ."
"In 19@@ 7@@ 0 , the d@@ am b@@ ur@@ sts . The d@@ am b@@ ur@@ sts ."
C@@ om@@ for@@ t is no l@@ on@@ ger why we w@@ at@@ ch t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion .
So@@ ci@@ al comm@@ ent@@ ary and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence ri@@ se thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the 70@@ s .
Now look at this .
The 70@@ s means who ? N@@ or@@ man Le@@ ar .
"You have &quot; &quot; A@@ ll in the F@@ am@@ i@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ an@@ for@@ d and S@@ on , &quot; &quot; and the d@@ om@@ in@@ ant show — in the t@@ op@@ -@@ 10 for the enti@@ re 70@@ s — &quot; M@@ A@@ S * H@@ . &quot;"

"O@@ n@@ ly one gener@@ ation , 2@@ 0 years in , and we disc@@ over@@ ed , W@@ ow ! T@@ V can do that ?"
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
"So to this very , very sa@@ v@@ v@@ y c@@ ro@@ w@@ d , I also want to n@@ ot@@ e the di@@ g@@ it@@ al f@@ ol@@ ks did not inv@@ ent dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tive ."
Ar@@ ch@@ i@@ e B@@ un@@ k@@ er was sh@@ o@@ ved out of his e@@ as@@ y c@@ ha@@ ir al@@ ong with the re@@ st of us 4@@ 0 years ago .

D@@ o we want to see show@@ s about people sa@@ ving money and being un@@ e@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed ?

What were those show@@ s ?
Gl@@ am@@ or@@ ous and ri@@ ch .
"@@ &quot; D@@ all@@ as , &quot; &quot; F@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ y I@@ sl@@ and . &quot;"
In@@ cre@@ di@@ ble m@@ app@@ ing of our na@@ tional p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e with some hard and f@@ ast fac@@ ts : un@@ e@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .

Wh@@ y not ?
We had a 2@@ 000 pre@@ si@@ d@@ enti@@ al elec@@ tion deci@@ ded by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
We had the b@@ ur@@ st@@ ing of the t@@ ec@@ h bu@@ b@@ ble .

L@@ oo@@ k what happen@@ s when we ke@@ ep going .
"A@@ t the tur@@ n of the c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y , the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t ta@@ kes off , re@@ ality t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion has ta@@ k@@ en ho@@ ld ."
What do people want in their T@@ V then ?
I would have thought re@@ v@@ en@@ ge or n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a .
Gi@@ ve me some com@@ for@@ t ; my world is f@@ all@@ ing ap@@ art .

"So as d@@ ra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally different as these t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion show@@ s , p@@ ure en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment , have been over the last 5@@ 0 years — what did I start with ? — one bas@@ ic in@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ t re@@ ma@@ ins ."
"We &apos;re an@@ im@@ als , we need our mom@@ s ."

"The 19@@ 80@@ s , our first cou@@ g@@ ar was gi@@ ven to us in the form of A@@ le@@ x@@ is C@@ ar@@ r@@ ing@@ t@@ on ."
M@@ ur@@ ph@@ y B@@ ro@@ wn took on a v@@ ice pre@@ si@@ d@@ ent when she took on the idea of sing@@ le par@@ en@@ th@@ ood .

So th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause )
"Well we all know the W@@ or@@ ld Wi@@ de We@@ b has ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tely tran@@ s@@ form@@ ed publi@@ sh@@ ing , b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st@@ ing , comm@@ er@@ ce and soci@@ al con@@ nec@@ tiv@@ ity , but where did it all come from ?"
"And I &apos;ll quot@@ e three people : V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h , D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art and Ti@@ m B@@ er@@ n@@ er@@ s-@@ Le@@ e ."
So let &apos;s just ru@@ n through these gu@@ ys .
This is V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h .
V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h was the U.@@ S@@ . gover@@ n@@ ment &apos;s ch@@ i@@ e@@ f sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c ad@@ vi@@ s@@ er d@@ ur@@ ing the w@@ ar .
"And in 19@@ 4@@ 5 , he publi@@ sh@@ ed an ar@@ tic@@ le in a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine called A@@ tl@@ an@@ tic M@@ on@@ th@@ ly ."
And the ar@@ tic@@ le was called &quot; &quot; A@@ s We M@@ ay Th@@ in@@ k . &quot; &quot; And what V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h was sa@@ ying was the way we use information is b@@ ro@@ k@@ en .
We don &apos;t work in ter@@ ms of li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies and ca@@ tal@@ o@@ g sy@@ st@@ ems and so for@@ th .
The brain wor@@ ks by as@@ soci@@ ation .
"W@@ ith one it@@ e@@ m in its thought , it s@@ n@@ ap@@ s in@@ st@@ an@@ tly to the next it@@ e@@ m ."
And the way information is struc@@ tu@@ red is t@@ ot@@ ally in@@ cap@@ able of ke@@ ep@@ ing up with this pro@@ cess .
"And so he su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ed a m@@ ach@@ ine , and he called it the me@@ me@@ x ."
"And the me@@ me@@ x would l@@ in@@ k information , one piec@@ e of information to a re@@ l@@ ated piec@@ e of information and so for@@ th ."
Now this was in 19@@ 4@@ 5 .
A compu@@ ter in those d@@ ays was something the sec@@ re@@ t ser@@ v@@ ic@@ es used to use for co@@ de bre@@ a@@ king .
And no@@ body k@@ new any@@ thing about it .
So this was before the compu@@ ter was inv@@ en@@ ted .
And he pro@@ pos@@ ed this m@@ ach@@ ine called the me@@ me@@ x .
"And he had a pl@@ at@@ form where you l@@ in@@ ked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will ."
"So sp@@ in@@ ning for@@ w@@ ard , one of the gu@@ ys who re@@ ad this ar@@ tic@@ le was a gu@@ y called D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art , and he was a U.@@ S@@ . A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce off@@ ic@@ er ."
And he was read@@ ing it in their li@@ br@@ ary in the F@@ ar E@@ ast .
"And he was so in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by this ar@@ tic@@ le , it kind of di@@ rec@@ ted the re@@ st of his life ."
"And by the mi@@ d-@@ 60@@ s , he was able to put this into ac@@ tion when he wor@@ ked at the St@@ an@@ for@@ d R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch La@@ b in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
He buil@@ t a system .
"The system was desig@@ ned to au@@ g@@ ment human int@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ ence , it was called ."
"And in a pre@@ mon@@ i@@ tion of today &apos;s world of cl@@ ou@@ d compu@@ ting and so@@ f@@ tw@@ ar@@ es of ser@@ v@@ ice , his system was called N@@ L@@ S for o@@ N@@ -@@ L@@ ine Sy@@ stem ."
And this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art .
He was gi@@ ving a pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tion at the F@@ all Jo@@ int C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence in 19@@ 6@@ 8 .
"Wh@@ at he show@@ ed — he s@@ at on a st@@ age like this , and he de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated this system ."
He had his he@@ ad mi@@ c like I &apos;ve got .
And he wor@@ ks this system .
"And you can see , he &apos;s working between do@@ c@@ um@@ ents and grap@@ h@@ ic@@ s and so for@@ th ."
"And he &apos;s dri@@ ving it all with this pl@@ at@@ form here , with a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ f@@ ing@@ er ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard and the world &apos;s first compu@@ ter m@@ ou@@ se , which he sp@@ eci@@ ally desig@@ ned in or@@ der to do this system ."
So this is where the m@@ ou@@ se came from as well .
So this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art .
The tr@@ ou@@ ble with D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art &apos;s system was that the compu@@ ters in those d@@ ays c@@ ost se@@ ver@@ al million p@@ oun@@ ds .
"So for a per@@ s@@ on@@ al compu@@ ter , a few million p@@ oun@@ ds was like ha@@ ving a per@@ s@@ on@@ al j@@ et plan@@ e ; it w@@ as@@ n &apos;t really very pr@@ ac@@ tical ."
"But sp@@ in on to the 80@@ s when per@@ s@@ on@@ al compu@@ ters did ar@@ ri@@ ve , then there was room for this kind of system on per@@ s@@ on@@ al compu@@ ters ."
"And my comp@@ any , O@@ W@@ L buil@@ t a system called Gu@@ i@@ de for the Ap@@ ple M@@ ac@@ int@@ os@@ h ."
And we de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed the world &apos;s first hy@@ per@@ t@@ ex@@ t system .
And this be@@ g@@ an to get a he@@ ad of ste@@ am .
"@@ Ap@@ ple int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed a thing called Hy@@ per@@ C@@ ard , and they made a bit of a f@@ us@@ s about it ."
They had a 1@@ 2-@@ p@@ age su@@ pp@@ le@@ ment in the W@@ all St@@ re@@ et J@@ our@@ n@@ al the day it la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed .
The ma@@ ga@@ z@@ in@@ es started to co@@ ver it .
By@@ te ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine and C@@ om@@ m@@ uni@@ ca@@ tions at the A@@ C@@ M had sp@@ eci@@ al is@@ su@@ es co@@ ver@@ ing hy@@ per@@ t@@ ex@@ t .
We develop@@ ed a P@@ C ver@@ sion of this produc@@ t as well as the M@@ ac@@ int@@ os@@ h ver@@ sion .
And our P@@ C ver@@ sion be@@ came quite mat@@ ure .
Th@@ ese are some ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es of this system in ac@@ tion in the l@@ ate 80@@ s .
"You were able to de@@ li@@ ver do@@ c@@ um@@ ents , were able to do it over ne@@ t@@ wor@@ ks ."
We develop@@ ed a system s@@ uch that it had a mar@@ k@@ up l@@ an@@ gu@@ age bas@@ ed on h@@ t@@ m@@ l .
We called it h@@ m@@ l : hy@@ per@@ t@@ ex@@ t mar@@ k@@ up l@@ an@@ gu@@ age .
"And the system was cap@@ able of doing very , very lar@@ ge do@@ c@@ um@@ en@@ ta@@ tion sy@@ st@@ ems over compu@@ ter ne@@ t@@ wor@@ ks ."
So I took this system to a tra@@ de show in V@@ er@@ sa@@ ill@@ es ne@@ ar P@@ ar@@ is in l@@ ate No@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 19@@ 9@@ 0 .
"And I was ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ed by a n@@ ice y@@ oun@@ g man called Ti@@ m B@@ er@@ n@@ er@@ s-@@ Le@@ e who said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you I@@ an R@@ it@@ ch@@ i@@ e ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he to@@ ld me about his pro@@ pos@@ ed system called the W@@ or@@ ld Wi@@ de We@@ b ."
"And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pret@@ enti@@ ous na@@ me , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally s@@ in@@ ce the whole system r@@ an on his compu@@ ter in his off@@ ice ."
But he was comple@@ tely con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that his W@@ or@@ ld Wi@@ de We@@ b would take over the world one day .
"And he tri@@ ed to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e me to wr@@ ite the b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ er for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any grap@@ h@@ ic@@ s or f@@ on@@ ts or l@@ ay@@ out or any@@ thing ; it was just pla@@ in t@@ ex@@ t ."
"I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a gu@@ y from C@@ E@@ R@@ N , he &apos;s not going to do this ."
So we didn &apos;t do it .
"In the next cou@@ ple of years , the hy@@ per@@ t@@ ex@@ t comm@@ unity didn &apos;t re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e him ei@@ ther ."
"In 19@@ 9@@ 2 , his p@@ ap@@ er was re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted for the Hy@@ per@@ t@@ ex@@ t C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence ."
"In 19@@ 9@@ 3 , there was a t@@ able at the con@@ f@@ er@@ ence in Se@@ at@@ tle , and a gu@@ y called M@@ ar@@ c An@@ dre@@ ess@@ en was de@@ mon@@ str@@ ating his little b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ er for the W@@ or@@ ld Wi@@ de We@@ b ."
"And I sa@@ w it , and I thought , ye@@ p , that &apos;s it ."
"And the very next year , in 19@@ 9@@ 4 , we had the con@@ f@@ er@@ ence here in E@@ d@@ in@@ b@@ ur@@ gh , and I had no op@@ pos@@ i@@ tion in ha@@ ving Ti@@ m B@@ er@@ n@@ er@@ s-@@ Le@@ e as the ke@@ yn@@ ot@@ e spe@@ ak@@ er ."
So that pu@@ ts me in pret@@ ty ill@@ u@@ stri@@ ous comp@@ any .
There was a gu@@ y called D@@ ic@@ k Ro@@ we who was at D@@ ec@@ c@@ a R@@ ec@@ or@@ ds and tur@@ ned down The Be@@ at@@ l@@ es .
"There was a gu@@ y called G@@ ary K@@ il@@ d@@ all who went fl@@ ying his plan@@ e when I@@ B@@ M came looking for an op@@ er@@ ating system for the I@@ B@@ M P@@ C , and he w@@ as@@ n &apos;t there , so they went back to see B@@ ill G@@ ates ."
"And the 1@@ 2 publi@@ sh@@ ers who tur@@ ned down J@@ .@@ K@@ . R@@ ow@@ l@@ ing &apos;s H@@ ar@@ ry P@@ ot@@ ter , I gu@@ ess ."
"O@@ n the other h@@ and , there &apos;s M@@ ar@@ c An@@ dre@@ ess@@ en who wr@@ ot@@ e the world &apos;s first b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ er for the W@@ or@@ ld Wi@@ de We@@ b ."
"And ac@@ cor@@ ding to F@@ ort@@ un@@ e ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine , he &apos;s wor@@ th 70@@ 0 million doll@@ ars ."
But is he happ@@ y ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
"In 19@@ 9@@ 4 , I wal@@ ked into a pri@@ son in C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ a , and I me@@ t a 1@@ 2-@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old bo@@ y who had been t@@ or@@ tu@@ red and was d@@ en@@ i@@ ed ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l ."
"And as I loo@@ ked into his ey@@ es , I re@@ aliz@@ ed that for the h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of le@@ t@@ ters I had wr@@ it@@ ten for poli@@ tical pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers , that I would never have wr@@ it@@ ten a le@@ tter for him , because he was not a 1@@ 2-@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old bo@@ y who had done something important for any@@ body ."
He was not a poli@@ tical pri@@ s@@ on@@ er .
He was a 1@@ 2-@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old bo@@ y who had st@@ ol@@ en a b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le .
"Wh@@ at I also re@@ aliz@@ ed at that point was that it was not only C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ a , but of the 11@@ 3 develop@@ ing coun@@ tries that t@@ or@@ ture , 9@@ 3 of these coun@@ tries have all p@@ as@@ s@@ ed la@@ ws that say you have a right to a la@@ wy@@ er and you have a right not to be t@@ or@@ tu@@ red ."
And what I re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ ed was that there was an incre@@ di@@ ble w@@ in@@ d@@ ow of opp@@ ort@@ unity for us as a world comm@@ unity to come together and end t@@ or@@ ture as an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tive to@@ o@@ l .
"We of@@ ten think of t@@ or@@ ture as being poli@@ tical t@@ or@@ ture or res@@ er@@ ved for just the wor@@ st , but , in fact , 9@@ 5 percent of t@@ or@@ ture today is not for poli@@ tical pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers ."
"It is for people who are in b@@ ro@@ k@@ en@@ -@@ down le@@ g@@ al sy@@ st@@ ems , and un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely because t@@ or@@ ture is the ch@@ e@@ ap@@ est form of inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ation — it &apos;s ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er than ha@@ ving a le@@ g@@ al system , ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er than ha@@ ving a la@@ wy@@ er and ear@@ ly ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l — it is what happen@@ s most of the time ."
"I believe today that it is pos@@ sible for us as a world comm@@ unity , if we make a deci@@ sion , to come together and end t@@ or@@ ture as an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tive to@@ o@@ l in our li@@ fe@@ time , but it will re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e three things ."
"F@@ ir@@ st is the tra@@ in@@ ing , e@@ mp@@ ow@@ er@@ ment , and con@@ nec@@ tion of de@@ f@@ end@@ ers wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
The second is in@@ sur@@ ing that there is sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic ear@@ ly ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l .
And the th@@ ir@@ d is comm@@ it@@ ment .
"So in the year 2@@ 000 , I be@@ g@@ an to w@@ on@@ der , what if we came together ?"
C@@ ould we do something for these 9@@ 3 coun@@ tries ?
And I f@@ oun@@ ded In@@ ter@@ na@@ tional B@@ ri@@ d@@ ges to J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce which has a sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c m@@ is@@ sion of en@@ ding t@@ or@@ ture as an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tive to@@ o@@ l and imp@@ le@@ m@@ en@@ ting du@@ e pro@@ cess ri@@ gh@@ ts in the 9@@ 3 coun@@ tries by plac@@ ing tra@@ in@@ ed la@@ wy@@ ers at an ear@@ ly st@@ age in poli@@ ce st@@ ations and in cour@@ t@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
"M@@ y first experi@@ en@@ ces , th@@ ough , did come from C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ a , and at the time I re@@ memb@@ er first coming to C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ a and there were , in 19@@ 9@@ 4 , still less than 10 at@@ t@@ or@@ ne@@ ys in the country because the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge had k@@ ill@@ ed them all ."
"And even 2@@ 0 years l@@ ater , there was only 10 la@@ wy@@ ers in the country , so con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently you &apos;d wal@@ k into a pri@@ son and not only would you me@@ et 1@@ 2-@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old bo@@ ys , you &apos;d me@@ et women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ y are you here ? &quot; &quot; W@@ om@@ en would say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my h@@ us@@ b@@ and comm@@ it@@ ted a cri@@ me , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no ru@@ le of la@@ w ."
"The first grou@@ p of de@@ f@@ end@@ ers came together and I still re@@ memb@@ er , as I was tra@@ in@@ ing , I said , &quot; Ok@@ ay , what do you do for an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ation ? &quot;"
"And there was s@@ il@@ ence in the cl@@ as@@ s , and fin@@ ally one wom@@ an st@@ ood up , &#9@@ 1@@ ; in@@ au@@ di@@ ble na@@ me &#9@@ 3@@ ; , and she said &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ re@@ w , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; te@@ ac@@ her . &quot; &quot; S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; I have de@@ f@@ en@@ ded more than a h@@ und@@ red people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ation , because they all come with con@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ ons . &quot; &quot; And we tal@@ ked about , as a cl@@ as@@ s , the fact that number one , the con@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ ons might not be re@@ li@@ able , but number two , we did not want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the poli@@ ce to ke@@ ep doing this , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally as it was now aga@@ in@@ st the la@@ w ."
And it took a lot of cou@@ ra@@ ge for these de@@ f@@ end@@ ers to deci@@ de that they would be@@ g@@ in to st@@ and up and su@@ pp@@ ort each other in imp@@ le@@ m@@ en@@ ting these la@@ ws .
"And I still re@@ memb@@ er the first ca@@ ses where they came , all 2@@ 5 together , she would st@@ and up , and they were in the back , and they would su@@ pp@@ ort her , and the ju@@ d@@ ges ke@@ p@@ t sa@@ ying , &quot; &quot; N@@ o , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the ex@@ act same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the per@@ f@@ ect ca@@ se came , and it was a wom@@ an who was a ve@@ ge@@ t@@ able sel@@ l@@ er , she was s@@ it@@ ting out@@ side of a h@@ ou@@ se ."
"S@@ he said she actually sa@@ w the person ru@@ n out who she thin@@ ks st@@ ole wh@@ at@@ ever the j@@ ew@@ el@@ ry was , but the poli@@ ce came , they got her , there was no@@ thing on her ."
S@@ he was pre@@ gn@@ ant at the time . S@@ he had ci@@ g@@ ar@@ et@@ te b@@ ur@@ ns on her . S@@ he &apos;d m@@ is@@ car@@ ri@@ ed .
"And when they br@@ ou@@ ght her ca@@ se to the ju@@ d@@ ge , for the first time he st@@ ood up and he said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , there &apos;s no e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence ex@@ cep@@ t for your t@@ or@@ ture con@@ f@@ es@@ sion and you will be re@@ le@@ as@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And the de@@ f@@ end@@ ers be@@ g@@ an to take ca@@ ses over and over again and you will see , they have ste@@ p by ste@@ p be@@ g@@ an to change the course of hi@@ story in C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ a ."
But C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ a is not al@@ one .
"I used to think , well is it C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ a ?"
O@@ r is it other coun@@ tries ?
But it is in so many coun@@ tries .
"In B@@ ur@@ und@@ i I wal@@ ked into a pri@@ son and it w@@ as@@ n &apos;t a 1@@ 2-@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old bo@@ y , it was an 8@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old bo@@ y for ste@@ al@@ ing a mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ one ."
"O@@ r a wom@@ an , I pic@@ ked up her b@@ ab@@ y , really c@@ ut@@ e b@@ ab@@ y , I said &quot; &quot; Y@@ our b@@ ab@@ y is so c@@ ut@@ e . &quot; &quot; It w@@ as@@ n &apos;t a b@@ ab@@ y , she was three ."
"And she said &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was ac@@ c@@ used of ste@@ al@@ ing two di@@ ap@@ ers and an ir@@ on for her b@@ ab@@ y and still had been in pri@@ son ."
"And when I wal@@ ked up to the pri@@ son di@@ rec@@ t@@ or , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out ."
"@@ A ju@@ d@@ ge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Ok@@ ay , we can talk about it , but look at my pri@@ son . Ei@@ gh@@ ty percent of the two thou@@ s@@ and people here are with@@ out a la@@ wy@@ er . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So la@@ wy@@ ers be@@ g@@ an to cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous@@ ly st@@ and up together to organ@@ iz@@ e a system where they can take ca@@ ses ."
"But we re@@ aliz@@ ed that it &apos;s not only the tra@@ in@@ ing of the la@@ wy@@ ers , but the con@@ nec@@ tion of the la@@ wy@@ ers that ma@@ kes a differ@@ ence ."
"F@@ or example , in C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ a , it was that &#9@@ 1@@ ; in@@ au@@ di@@ ble na@@ me &#9@@ 3@@ ; did not go al@@ one but she had 2@@ 4 la@@ wy@@ ers with her who st@@ ood up together . And in the same way , in Ch@@ in@@ a , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a f@@ res@@ h w@@ ind in the des@@ er@@ t when we can come together . &quot; &quot; O@@ r in Z@@ im@@ b@@ ab@@ we , where I re@@ memb@@ er In@@ no@@ cent , after coming out of a pri@@ son where every@@ body st@@ ood up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , ei@@ ght years , 1@@ 2 years with@@ out a la@@ wy@@ er , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a tra@@ in@@ ing together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have he@@ ard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had he@@ ard people m@@ um@@ bl@@ ing@@ "
"@@ and gr@@ um@@ bl@@ ing — &quot; &quot; I have he@@ ard it said that we can@@ not help to create j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce because we do not have the res@@ our@@ ces . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the l@@ ack of res@@ our@@ ces is never an ex@@ c@@ use for in@@ j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce . &quot; &quot; And with that , he s@@ uc@@ c@@ ess@@ ful@@ ly organ@@ iz@@ ed 6@@ 8 la@@ wy@@ ers who have been sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally ta@@ king the ca@@ ses ."
"The k@@ ey that we see , th@@ ough , is tra@@ in@@ ing and then ear@@ ly ac@@ cess ."
"I was rec@@ ently in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , and was in@@ sp@@ i@@ red to me@@ et with another grou@@ p of la@@ wy@@ ers , and what they to@@ ld me is that they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , look , we don &apos;t have poli@@ ce on the st@@ re@@ e@@ ts now . The poli@@ ce are one of the ma@@ in reas@@ ons why we had the re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution . They were t@@ ort@@ ur@@ ing every@@ body all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been ten@@ s of mil@@ li@@ ons of doll@@ ars that have rec@@ ently g@@ one in to the develop@@ ment of the le@@ g@@ al system here ."
"Wh@@ at &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I me@@ t with one of the develop@@ ment ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es , and they were tra@@ in@@ ing pr@@ os@@ ec@@ ut@@ ors and ju@@ d@@ ges , which is the n@@ or@@ ma@@ l bi@@ as , as op@@ pos@@ ed to de@@ f@@ end@@ ers ."
And they show@@ ed me a man@@ u@@ al which actually was an ex@@ c@@ ell@@ ent man@@ u@@ al .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m g@@ on@@ n@@ a c@@ op@@ y this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . L@@ aw@@ y@@ ers can come at the poli@@ ce st@@ ation . It was per@@ f@@ ect ."
Pr@@ os@@ ec@@ ut@@ ors were per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly tra@@ in@@ ed .
"But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that every@@ body got to the pr@@ os@@ ec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s off@@ ice , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pa@@ use , they said , &quot; They had been t@@ or@@ tu@@ red . &quot;"
"So the piec@@ es are , not only the tra@@ in@@ ing of the la@@ wy@@ ers , but us fin@@ ding a way to sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally imp@@ le@@ ment ear@@ ly ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l , because they are the sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard in the system for people who are being t@@ or@@ tu@@ red ."
"And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the fact that it s@@ oun@@ ds like , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , ok@@ ay , it s@@ oun@@ ds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it s@@ oun@@ ds big ."
And there are many reas@@ ons why I believe it &apos;s pos@@ sible .
The first reas@@ on is the people on the gr@@ ound who find ways of cre@@ ating m@@ ir@@ ac@@ l@@ es because of their comm@@ it@@ ment .
"It &apos;s not only In@@ no@@ cent , who I to@@ ld you about in Z@@ im@@ b@@ ab@@ we , but de@@ f@@ end@@ ers all over the world who are looking for these piec@@ es ."
"We have a pro@@ gra@@ m called J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , and we re@@ aliz@@ ed there are people that are cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous and want to do things , but how can we su@@ pp@@ ort them ?"
So it &apos;s an on@@ line cont@@ est where it &apos;s only fi@@ ve thou@@ s@@ and doll@@ ars if you come up with and in@@ no@@ va@@ tive way of imp@@ le@@ m@@ en@@ ting j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce .
"And there are 3@@ 0 J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the world , from Sr@@ i L@@ an@@ k@@ a to S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and to the D@@ R@@ C , who with fi@@ ve thou@@ s@@ and doll@@ ars do a@@ ma@@ zing things , through S@@ M@@ S pro@@ gra@@ ms , through par@@ al@@ eg@@ al pro@@ gra@@ ms , through wh@@ at@@ ever they can do ."
"And it &apos;s not only these J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , but people we cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous@@ ly see fi@@ g@@ ure out who their ne@@ t@@ wor@@ ks are and how they can mo@@ ve it for@@ w@@ ard ."
"So in Ch@@ in@@ a , for in@@ st@@ ance , great la@@ ws came out where it sa@@ ys poli@@ ce can@@ not t@@ or@@ ture people or they will be p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ed ."
"And I was s@@ it@@ ting side by side with one of our very cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous la@@ wy@@ ers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make s@@ ure that this is imp@@ le@@ m@@ en@@ ted ?"
"This is f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; N@@ o . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ok@@ ay , we can still fi@@ g@@ ure it out . &quot; &quot; And on D@@ ec@@ em@@ b@@ er 4 , he organ@@ iz@@ ed three thou@@ s@@ and memb@@ ers of the Y@@ ou@@ th C@@ om@@ m@@ un@@ ist Le@@ ag@@ ue , from 1@@ 4 of the to@@ p la@@ w sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s , who organ@@ iz@@ ed the@@ m@@ selves , develop@@ ed pos@@ ters with the new la@@ ws , and went to the poli@@ ce st@@ ations and be@@ g@@ an what he sa@@ ys is a n@@ on@@ -@@ vi@@ ol@@ ent le@@ g@@ al re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution to prot@@ ect ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ri@@ gh@@ ts ."
So I tal@@ ked about the fact that we need to tra@@ in and su@@ pp@@ ort de@@ f@@ end@@ ers .
We need to sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally imp@@ le@@ ment ear@@ ly ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l .
But the th@@ ir@@ d and most important thing is that we make a comm@@ it@@ ment to this .
"And people of@@ ten say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s w@@ il@@ d@@ ly ide@@ al@@ is@@ tic ."
"N@@ ever going to happ@@ en . &quot; &quot; And the reas@@ on that I think that those wor@@ ds are interesting is because those were the same k@@ in@@ ds of wor@@ ds that were used for people who deci@@ ded they would end s@@ la@@ very , or end ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id ."
It be@@ g@@ an with a small grou@@ p of people who deci@@ ded they would comm@@ it .
"Now , there &apos;s one of our fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite po@@ ems from the de@@ f@@ end@@ ers , which they sh@@ are from each other , is : &quot; &quot; Ta@@ ke cou@@ ra@@ ge fri@@ en@@ ds , the ro@@ ad is of@@ ten long , the p@@ ath is never c@@ le@@ ar , and the sta@@ kes are very hi@@ gh , but de@@ ep down , you are not al@@ one . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world comm@@ unity to su@@ pp@@ ort not only de@@ f@@ end@@ ers , but also every@@ one in the system who is looking to@@ war@@ ds it , we can end t@@ or@@ ture as an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tive to@@ o@@ l ."
"I end always , because I &apos;m s@@ ure the ques@@ tions are — and I &apos;d be happ@@ y to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , I would say this . F@@ ir@@ st of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would lea@@ ve you with the story of V@@ i@@ sh@@ n@@ a , who actually was my in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion for star@@ ting In@@ ter@@ na@@ tional B@@ ri@@ d@@ ges to J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce ."
"V@@ i@@ sh@@ n@@ a was a 4-@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old bo@@ y when I me@@ t him who was bor@@ n in a C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ an pri@@ son in K@@ and@@ al P@@ ro@@ v@@ in@@ ce . But because he was bor@@ n in the pri@@ son , every@@ body lo@@ ved him , in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding the gu@@ ar@@ ds , so he was the only one who was al@@ low@@ ed to come in and out of the b@@ ars ."
"So , you know , there &apos;s b@@ ars . And by the time that V@@ i@@ sh@@ n@@ a was getting bi@@ gg@@ er , which means what ge@@ ts bi@@ gg@@ er ? Y@@ our he@@ ad ge@@ ts bi@@ gg@@ er ."
"So he would come to the first b@@ ar , the second b@@ ar and then the th@@ ir@@ d b@@ ar , and then really s@@ low@@ ly mo@@ ve his he@@ ad so he could f@@ it through , and come back , th@@ ir@@ d , second , first . And he would gra@@ b my p@@ in@@ ki@@ e , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go vi@@ s@@ it ."
"You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to vi@@ s@@ it all 15@@ 6 pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers . And I would li@@ ft him , and he would put his f@@ ing@@ ers through ."
"O@@ r if they were d@@ ar@@ k c@@ ells , it was like ir@@ on cor@@ ru@@ g@@ ated , and he would put his f@@ ing@@ ers through ."
"And most of the pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers said that he was their gre@@ at@@ est jo@@ y and their s@@ un@@ sh@@ ine , and they loo@@ ked for@@ w@@ ard to him . And I was like , here &apos;s V@@ i@@ sh@@ n@@ a . He &apos;s a 4-@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old bo@@ y ."
"H@@ e was bor@@ n in a pri@@ son with al@@ most no@@ thing , no mat@@ eri@@ al go@@ o@@ ds , but he had a sense of his own h@@ er@@ o@@ ic j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , which I believe we are all bor@@ n into . He said , &quot; &quot; P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably I can &apos;t do everything ."
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
"And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I th@@ ank you for ha@@ ving the pro@@ p@@ he@@ tic ima@@ gin@@ ation to ima@@ gine the sh@@ ap@@ ing of a new world with us together , and inv@@ ite you into this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y with us ."

"F@@ or example , how does your wor@@ l@@ d@@ vi@@ e@@ w re@@ act when you see this ima@@ ge : ( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ ali@@ a Mo@@ ga@@ h@@ ed : What do you think when you look at me ?"
I@@ de@@ as are the most pow@@ er@@ ful for@@ ce sh@@ ap@@ ing human cul@@ ture .
"C@@ an I as@@ k you to p@@ le@@ ase rec@@ all a time when you really lo@@ ved something — a mo@@ vi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a s@@ ong or a book — and you re@@ comm@@ en@@ ded it wh@@ o@@ le@@ he@@ ar@@ te@@ d@@ ly to some@@ one you also really li@@ ked , and you an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated that re@@ ac@@ tion , you wa@@ ited for it , and it came back , and the person h@@ ated it ?"
"So , by way of int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same st@@ ate in which I sp@@ ent every working day of the last si@@ x years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach hi@@ gh school mat@@ h ."
"I s@@ ell a produc@@ t to a mar@@ k@@ et that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ c@@ ed by la@@ w to bu@@ y it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a l@@ os@@ ing pro@@ pos@@ i@@ tion ."
"So there &apos;s a us@@ e@@ ful st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about stu@@ d@@ ents that I see , a us@@ e@@ ful st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about you all ."
"I could give you gu@@ ys an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would exp@@ ect no high@@ er than a 2@@ 5 percent p@@ as@@ s r@@ ate ."
And bot@@ h of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my stu@@ d@@ ents than they do about what we call mat@@ h e@@ du@@ cation in the U.@@ S@@ . today .
"T@@ o start with , I &apos;d like to bre@@ a@@ k mat@@ h down into two ca@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies ."
On@@ e is compu@@ ta@@ tion ; this is the stu@@ ff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"F@@ or example , fac@@ t@@ or@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ tic@@ s with le@@ ad@@ ing co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ents gre@@ ater than one ."
"This stu@@ ff is also really e@@ as@@ y to re@@ lear@@ n , pro@@ vi@@ ded you have a really str@@ ong gr@@ oun@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the app@@ li@@ cation of mat@@ h pro@@ c@@ ess@@ es to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love stu@@ d@@ ents to re@@ ta@@ in , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical fi@@ el@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.@@ S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they w@@ on &apos;t re@@ ta@@ in it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s s@@ uch a c@@ al@@ am@@ ity for soci@@ e@@ ty , what we can do about it and , to cl@@ ose with , why this is an a@@ ma@@ zing time to be a mat@@ h te@@ ac@@ her ."
"So first , fi@@ ve sy@@ mp@@ t@@ om@@ s that you &apos;re doing mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing wr@@ ong in your cl@@ as@@ s@@ room ."
On@@ e is a l@@ ack of in@@ i@@ ti@@ a@@ tive ; your stu@@ d@@ ents don &apos;t sel@@ f-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your l@@ ec@@ ture b@@ lo@@ c@@ k and im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely you have fi@@ ve h@@ ands going up as@@ king you to re@@ -@@ ex@@ pla@@ in the enti@@ re thing at their des@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents l@@ ack per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
"They l@@ ack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find y@@ our@@ self re@@ -@@ ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ing con@@ cep@@ ts three mon@@ ths l@@ ater , wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ale ."
"There &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ sion to wor@@ d proble@@ ms , which des@@ cri@@ b@@ es 9@@ 9 percent of my stu@@ d@@ ents ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the form@@ ul@@ a to app@@ ly in that s@@ it@@ u@@ ation .
This is really de@@ struc@@ tive .
"D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ at@@ or of &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ w@@ ood &quot; &quot; and other a@@ ma@@ zing T@@ V show@@ s , has a really good des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion for this ."
"H@@ e s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating con@@ te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary d@@ ra@@ m@@ a , show@@ s se@@ t in the pres@@ ent day , because he sa@@ w that when people f@@ ill their m@@ ind with four h@@ our@@ s a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; Tw@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ resp@@ ect , it sh@@ ap@@ es the ne@@ ur@@ al pa@@ th@@ ways , he said , in s@@ uch a way that they exp@@ ect si@@ mple proble@@ ms ."
"H@@ e called it , &quot; &quot; an imp@@ a@@ ti@@ ence with ir@@ re@@ sol@@ ution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re imp@@ a@@ ti@@ ent with things that don &apos;t re@@ sol@@ ve qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly ."
"You exp@@ ect s@@ it@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed proble@@ ms that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 min@@ ut@@ es , three comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al bre@@ a@@ ks and a l@@ au@@ gh tr@@ ack ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you al@@ ready know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that si@@ mple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my stu@@ d@@ ents will ru@@ n .
I &apos;m doing b@@ ad things to my own future and w@@ ell@@ -@@ being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks — par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly ma@@ ss@@ -@@ ad@@ op@@ ted t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks — te@@ ach mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pa@@ ti@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s f@@ un@@ c@@ tion@@ ally e@@ qu@@ i@@ val@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; Tw@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and call@@ ing it a day ."
( Laughter ) I@@ n all s@@ eri@@ ous@@ n@@ ess . H@@ ere &apos;s an example from a ph@@ ys@@ ic@@ s t@@ ex@@ t@@ book .
It app@@ li@@ es e@@ qu@@ ally to mat@@ h .
"N@@ o@@ ti@@ ce , first of all here , that you have ex@@ ac@@ tly three piec@@ es of information there , each of which will fi@@ g@@ ure into a form@@ ul@@ a some@@ where , ev@@ en@@ tually , which the stu@@ d@@ ent will then comp@@ ut@@ e ."
I believe in real life .
"And as@@ k y@@ our@@ self , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you k@@ new all of the gi@@ ven information in ad@@ v@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ pl@@ us of information and you had to f@@ il@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have su@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m s@@ ure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s ha@@ m@@ str@@ ing@@ ing stu@@ d@@ ents because , w@@ at@@ ch this , this is the pr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ce problem se@@ t ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tu@@ al problem se@@ t , we have proble@@ ms like this right here where we &apos;re just sw@@ app@@ ing out numb@@ ers and tw@@ ea@@ king the cont@@ ex@@ t a little bit ."
"And if the stu@@ d@@ ent still doesn &apos;t re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e the st@@ am@@ p this was m@@ ol@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ ful@@ ly ex@@ pla@@ ins to you what sa@@ mple problem you can re@@ tur@@ n to to find the form@@ ul@@ a ."
"You could lit@@ er@@ ally , I mean this , p@@ as@@ s this par@@ tic@@ ular un@@ it with@@ out kno@@ w@@ ing any ph@@ ys@@ ic@@ s , just kno@@ w@@ ing how to d@@ ec@@ o@@ de a t@@ ex@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a s@@ ha@@ me ."
So I can di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the problem a little more sp@@ eci@@ f@@ ically in mat@@ h .
H@@ ere &apos;s a really c@@ ool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about de@@ fin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ n@@ ess and s@@ lo@@ p@@ e using a sk@@ i li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate l@@ ay@@ ers , and I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate l@@ ay@@ ers and , par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pres@@ s@@ ed together and pres@@ en@@ ted to the stu@@ d@@ ent all at on@@ ce , how that cre@@ ates this imp@@ a@@ ti@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll de@@ f@@ ine them here : You have the vi@@ su@@ al .
"You also have the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical struc@@ ture , tal@@ king about g@@ ri@@ ds , me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ents , la@@ be@@ l@@ s , po@@ in@@ ts , ax@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have su@@ b@@ ste@@ ps , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which sec@@ tion is the ste@@ ep@@ est ."
So I hop@@ e you can see .
"I really hop@@ e you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is ta@@ king a comp@@ ell@@ ing question , a comp@@ ell@@ ing an@@ sw@@ er , but we &apos;re pa@@ ving a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght p@@ ath from one to the other and con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ating our stu@@ d@@ ents for how well they can ste@@ p over the small cr@@ ac@@ ks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and buil@@ d them up with stu@@ d@@ ents , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in ter@@ ms of pa@@ ti@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the vi@@ su@@ al , and I im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely as@@ k the question : Wh@@ ich sec@@ tion is the ste@@ ep@@ est ?"
And this star@@ ts con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion because the vi@@ su@@ al is cre@@ ated in s@@ uch a way where you can de@@ f@@ end two an@@ sw@@ ers .
"So you get people ar@@ gu@@ ing aga@@ in@@ st each other , fri@@ end ver@@ su@@ s fri@@ end , in pa@@ ir@@ s , j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ing , wh@@ at@@ ever ."
And then ev@@ en@@ tually we re@@ aliz@@ e it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the s@@ ki@@ er in the low@@ er le@@ f@@ t-@@ h@@ and side of the sc@@ re@@ en or the s@@ ki@@ er just ab@@ o@@ ve the m@@ id line .
"And we re@@ aliz@@ e how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D la@@ be@@ l@@ s to talk about them more e@@ as@@ i@@ ly ."
"And then as we start to de@@ f@@ ine what does ste@@ ep@@ n@@ ess mean , we re@@ aliz@@ e it would be n@@ ice to have some me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ents to really n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w it down , sp@@ eci@@ f@@ ically what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ ro@@ w down that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical struc@@ ture ."
"The mat@@ h ser@@ ves the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the mat@@ h ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 cl@@ as@@ ses are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ p@@ e , ste@@ ep@@ n@@ ess thing ."
"But if you need to , your stu@@ d@@ ents can then devel@@ op those su@@ b@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"D@@ o you gu@@ ys see how this , right here , com@@ par@@ ed to that — which one cre@@ ates that pa@@ ti@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , that mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been ob@@ vi@@ ous in my pr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ce , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ i@@ el@@ d the f@@ lo@@ or here for a second to E@@ in@@ ste@@ in , who , I believe , has pa@@ id his du@@ es ."
"H@@ e tal@@ ked about the form@@ ul@@ ation of a problem being so incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly important , and ye@@ t in my pr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ce , in the U.@@ S@@ . here , we just give proble@@ ms to stu@@ d@@ ents ; we don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve them in the form@@ ul@@ ation of the problem ."
So 9@@ 0 percent of what I do with my fi@@ ve h@@ our@@ s of pre@@ p time p@@ er we@@ e@@ k is to take fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ ell@@ ing el@@ em@@ ents of proble@@ ms like this from my t@@ ex@@ t@@ book and re@@ buil@@ d them in a way that su@@ pp@@ or@@ ts mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pa@@ ti@@ ent problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it wor@@ ks .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water t@@ ank .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ ir@@ st things first , we e@@ li@@ min@@ ate all the su@@ b@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents have to devel@@ op those , they have to form@@ ul@@ ate those ."
And then no@@ ti@@ ce that all the information wr@@ it@@ ten on there is stu@@ ff you &apos;ll need .
"N@@ one of it &apos;s a di@@ str@@ ac@@ t@@ or , so we l@@ ose that ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents need to deci@@ de , &quot; &quot; A@@ ll right , well , does the he@@ i@@ ght mat@@ ter ? Do@@ es the side of it mat@@ ter ?"
Do@@ es the col@@ or of the val@@ ve mat@@ ter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; S@@ uch an under@@ re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted question in mat@@ h cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .
So now we have a water t@@ ank .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 21@@ st c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y and we would love to talk about the real world on its own ter@@ ms , not in ter@@ ms of line art or cli@@ p art that you so of@@ ten see in t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , we go out and we take a pic@@ ture of it ."
So now we have the real de@@ al .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a vi@@ de@@ o , a vi@@ de@@ o of some@@ one f@@ ill@@ ing it up ."
"And it &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ing up s@@ low@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly s@@ low@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents are looking at their w@@ at@@ ch@@ es , ro@@ ll@@ ing their ey@@ es , and they &apos;re all w@@ on@@ der@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ ited the h@@ oo@@ k , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fu@@ n for me because , like the in@@ tr@@ o , I te@@ ach ki@@ ds — because of my in@@ experi@@ ence — I te@@ ach the ki@@ ds that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got ki@@ ds who will not jo@@ in a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about mat@@ h because some@@ one el@@ se has the form@@ ul@@ a ; some@@ one el@@ se kno@@ ws how to work the form@@ ul@@ a better than me , so I w@@ on &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stu@@ d@@ ent is on a le@@ vel pl@@ ay@@ ing fi@@ el@@ d of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion ."
"E@@ very@@ one &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ed something up with water before , so I get ki@@ ds an@@ sw@@ er@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got ki@@ ds who are ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally and con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion@@ ally in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated jo@@ in@@ ing the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"We put n@@ am@@ es on the bo@@ ard , at@@ t@@ ach them to gu@@ ess@@ es , and ki@@ ds have b@@ ou@@ ght in here ."
And then we f@@ ol@@ low the pro@@ cess I &apos;ve des@@ cri@@ b@@ ed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better par@@ ts is that we don &apos;t get our an@@ sw@@ er from the an@@ sw@@ er k@@ ey in the back of the te@@ ac@@ her &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion ."
"We , in@@ ste@@ ad , just w@@ at@@ ch the end of the mo@@ vi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ o@@ re@@ tical mo@@ d@@ el@@ s that always work out in the an@@ sw@@ er k@@ ey in the back of a te@@ ac@@ her &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s sc@@ ary to talk about s@@ our@@ ces of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ o@@ re@@ tical does not mat@@ ch up with the pr@@ ac@@ tical ."
"But those con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions have been so val@@ u@@ able , am@@ ong the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ p@@ ort some really fu@@ n g@@ am@@ es with stu@@ d@@ ents who come pre@@ -@@ in@@ st@@ all@@ ed with these vir@@ us@@ es day one of the cl@@ as@@ s .
"Th@@ ese are the ki@@ ds who now , one se@@ me@@ ster in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , t@@ ot@@ ally new , t@@ ot@@ ally fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n , and they &apos;ll have a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about it for three or four min@@ ut@@ es more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fu@@ n ."
"We &apos;re no l@@ on@@ ger a@@ ver@@ se to wor@@ d proble@@ ms , because we &apos;ve re@@ de@@ fin@@ ed what a wor@@ d problem is ."
"We &apos;re no l@@ on@@ ger in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated by mat@@ h , because we &apos;re s@@ low@@ ly re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing what mat@@ h is ."
This has been a lot of fu@@ n .
"I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge mat@@ h te@@ ach@@ ers I talk to to use m@@ ul@@ ti@@ medi@@ a , because it br@@ ings the real world into your cl@@ as@@ s@@ room in hi@@ gh re@@ sol@@ ution and ful@@ l col@@ or ; to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge stu@@ d@@ ent in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion for that le@@ vel pl@@ ay@@ ing fi@@ el@@ d ; to as@@ k the sh@@ ort@@ est question you pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly can and let those more sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c ques@@ tions come out in con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ; to let stu@@ d@@ ents buil@@ d the problem , because E@@ in@@ ste@@ in said so ; and to fin@@ ally , in t@@ ot@@ al , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book is hel@@ p@@ ing you in all the wr@@ ong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation , for pa@@ ti@@ ent problem sol@@ ving and mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an a@@ ma@@ zing time to be a mat@@ h te@@ ac@@ her right now is because we have the to@@ ol@@ s to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um in our fr@@ on@@ t po@@ ck@@ et .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fa@@ ir@@ ly ch@@ ea@@ p , and the to@@ ol@@ s to di@@ stri@@ bu@@ te it f@@ re@@ ely und@@ er op@@ en li@@ cen@@ ses has also never been ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er or more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a vi@@ de@@ o ser@@ ies on my b@@ lo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vi@@ e@@ ws in two we@@ e@@ ks ."
"I get e@@ ma@@ il@@ s still from te@@ ach@@ ers in coun@@ tries I &apos;ve never vi@@ s@@ ited sa@@ ying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ a@@ h . We had a good con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stu@@ ff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow ."
"I put this problem on my b@@ lo@@ g rec@@ ently : I@@ n a gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore , which line do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 1@@ 9 it@@ ems or the line with four car@@ ts and three , fi@@ ve , two and one it@@ ems ."
"And the l@@ in@@ e@@ ar mo@@ d@@ el@@ ing inv@@ ol@@ ved in that was some good stu@@ ff for my cl@@ as@@ s@@ room , but it ev@@ en@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; G@@ ood M@@ or@@ ning Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a &quot; &quot; a few we@@ e@@ ks l@@ ater , which is just bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ cl@@ u@@ de that people , not just stu@@ d@@ ents , are really h@@ un@@ gr@@ y for this ."
M@@ ath ma@@ kes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the vo@@ ca@@ b@@ ul@@ ary for your own in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion .
"So I just really en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , wh@@ at@@ ever your sta@@ ke is in e@@ du@@ cation — whe@@ ther you &apos;re a stu@@ d@@ ent , par@@ ent , te@@ ac@@ her , poli@@ cy ma@@ k@@ er , wh@@ at@@ ever — in@@ si@@ st on better mat@@ h cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um ."
We need more pa@@ ti@@ ent problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a b@@ ad idea .
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Qu@@ ad@@ r@@ o C@@ or@@ p@@ or@@ ation of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ i@@ a .
It &apos;s a piec@@ e of pl@@ as@@ tic with a Ra@@ di@@ o Sh@@ ack an@@ ten@@ n@@ a at@@ t@@ ach@@ ed to it .
So that &apos;s just a fu@@ n little example here of the s@@ or@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ ort of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are sci@@ ence and pl@@ umb@@ ing comp@@ a@@ ti@@ ble ?"
"And if it loo@@ ks a lot like a Bu@@ ic@@ k hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have some@@ body off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p ready to go .
"In the ca@@ se of G@@ al@@ il@@ e@@ o , he had two proble@@ ms when he tur@@ ned his t@@ el@@ es@@ c@@ op@@ e to S@@ at@@ ur@@ n ."
"And that , in fact , tur@@ ns out to be tr@@ ue ."
H@@ ere &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the side of a gl@@ as@@ s w@@ in@@ d@@ ow in Sa@@ o Pa@@ ul@@ o .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
"H@@ ere &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the bac@@ k@@ side , which they started to wi@@ p@@ e off ."
I was bor@@ n and ra@@ is@@ ed in N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a .
"A@@ l@@ th@@ ough my fami@@ ly con@@ st@@ an@@ tly str@@ u@@ gg@@ l@@ ed aga@@ in@@ st po@@ ver@@ ty , I was always lo@@ ved and car@@ ed for first , because I was the only son and the y@@ oun@@ g@@ est of two in the fami@@ ly ."
But then the great fam@@ ine be@@ g@@ an in 19@@ 9@@ 4 .
I was four years old .
M@@ y si@@ ster and I would go sear@@ ch@@ ing for fi@@ re@@ w@@ ood star@@ ting at 5 in the mor@@ ning and come back after mi@@ d@@ ni@@ ght .
"I would wan@@ der the st@@ re@@ e@@ ts sear@@ ch@@ ing for food , and I re@@ memb@@ er see@@ ing a small chil@@ d ti@@ ed to a mo@@ ther &apos;s back e@@ ating ch@@ i@@ ps , and wan@@ ting to ste@@ al them from him ."
H@@ un@@ ger is hum@@ i@@ li@@ ation . H@@ un@@ ger is hop@@ el@@ ess@@ n@@ ess .
"F@@ or a h@@ un@@ gr@@ y chil@@ d , poli@@ tic@@ s and f@@ re@@ e@@ do@@ m are not even thought of ."
"O@@ n my n@@ in@@ th b@@ ir@@ th@@ day , my par@@ ents cou@@ ldn &apos;t give me any food to e@@ at ."
"But even as a chil@@ d , I could feel the he@@ av@@ iness in their he@@ ar@@ ts ."
"O@@ ver a million N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans di@@ ed of star@@ v@@ ation in that time , and in 2@@ 00@@ 3 , when I was 1@@ 3 years old , my fa@@ ther be@@ came one of them ."
I sa@@ w my fa@@ ther wi@@ ther away and di@@ e .
"In the same year , my mo@@ ther dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed one day , and then my si@@ ster to@@ ld me that she was going to Ch@@ in@@ a to ear@@ n money , but that she would re@@ tur@@ n with money and food so@@ on ."
"S@@ in@@ ce we had never been se@@ par@@ ated , and I thought we would be together fo@@ re@@ ver , I didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g when she left ."
It was the bi@@ gg@@ est mi@@ sta@@ ke I have ever made in my life .
"But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long go@@ o@@ d@@ by@@ e ."
I have not se@@ en my mo@@ m or my si@@ ster s@@ in@@ ce then .
"S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , I be@@ came an or@@ p@@ ha@@ n and h@@ om@@ el@@ ess ."
"M@@ y da@@ i@@ ly life be@@ came very hard , but very si@@ mple ."
M@@ y go@@ al was to find a du@@ st@@ y piec@@ e of bre@@ ad in the tr@@ as@@ h .
But that is no way to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
"I started to re@@ aliz@@ e , be@@ gg@@ ing would not be the sol@@ ution ."
So I started to ste@@ al from food car@@ ts in il@@ le@@ g@@ al mar@@ ke@@ ts .
"S@@ om@@ e@@ times , I found small j@@ ob@@ s in ex@@ change for food ."
"O@@ n@@ ce , I even sp@@ ent two mon@@ ths in the w@@ in@@ ter working in a co@@ al m@@ ine , 3@@ 3 me@@ ters under@@ gr@@ ound with@@ out any prot@@ ec@@ tion for up to 1@@ 6 h@@ our@@ s a day ."
I was not un@@ comm@@ on .
"M@@ any other or@@ ph@@ ans sur@@ vi@@ ved this way , or wor@@ se ."
"When I could not f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep from b@@ it@@ ter co@@ ld or h@@ un@@ ger pa@@ ins , I hop@@ ed that , the next mor@@ ning , my si@@ ster would come back to wa@@ ke me up with my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite food ."
That hop@@ e ke@@ p@@ t me ali@@ ve .
"I don &apos;t mean big , gr@@ and hop@@ e ."
"I mean the kind of hop@@ e that made me believe that the next tr@@ as@@ h can had bre@@ ad , even th@@ ough it us@@ u@@ ally didn &apos;t ."
"But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t even try , and then I would di@@ e ."
H@@ op@@ e ke@@ p@@ t me ali@@ ve .
"E@@ very day , I to@@ ld my@@ self , no mat@@ ter how hard things got , still I m@@ ust live ."
"A@@ f@@ ter three years of wa@@ iting for my si@@ ster &apos;s re@@ tur@@ n , I deci@@ ded to go to Ch@@ in@@ a to look for her my@@ self ."
I re@@ aliz@@ ed I cou@@ ldn &apos;t sur@@ vi@@ ve much l@@ on@@ ger this way .

"I made it to Ch@@ in@@ a on Fe@@ br@@ u@@ ary 1@@ 5 , 2@@ 00@@ 6 ."
I was 1@@ 6 years old .

I thought more people would help me .
"But it was h@@ ar@@ der than li@@ ving in N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , because I was not f@@ ree ."

How many of you had to f@@ ill out some sort of we@@ b form where you &apos;ve been as@@ ked to re@@ ad a di@@ stor@@ ted se@@ qu@@ ence of ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ters like this ?
"H@@ ow many of you found it really , really an@@ no@@ ying ?"
"O@@ k@@ ay , out@@ st@@ an@@ ding . So I inv@@ en@@ ted that ."
( Laughter ) O@@ r I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
"And the reas@@ on it is there is to make s@@ ure you , the enti@@ ty f@@ ill@@ ing out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of compu@@ ter pro@@ gra@@ m that was wr@@ it@@ ten to su@@ bm@@ it the form mil@@ li@@ ons and mil@@ li@@ ons of times ."
"The reas@@ on it wor@@ ks is because hum@@ ans , at le@@ ast n@@ on@@ -@@ vi@@ su@@ all@@ y-@@ imp@@ ai@@ red hum@@ ans , have no tr@@ ou@@ ble read@@ ing these di@@ stor@@ ted s@@ qu@@ ig@@ g@@ ly ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ters , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as compu@@ ter pro@@ gra@@ ms si@@ mp@@ ly can &apos;t do it as well ye@@ t ."
"So for example , in the ca@@ se of T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ ma@@ ster , the reas@@ on you have to t@@ yp@@ e these di@@ stor@@ ted ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ters is to pre@@ v@@ ent sc@@ al@@ per@@ s from wr@@ iting a pro@@ gra@@ m that can bu@@ y mil@@ li@@ ons of tic@@ ke@@ ts , two at a time ."
C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are used all over the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t .
"And s@@ in@@ ce they &apos;re used so of@@ ten , a lot of times the pre@@ ci@@ se se@@ qu@@ ence of r@@ an@@ do@@ m ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ters that is sh@@ own to the us@@ er is not so for@@ t@@ un@@ ate ."
So this is an example from the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o re@@ gi@@ st@@ ra@@ tion p@@ age .
"The r@@ an@@ do@@ m ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ters that happened to be sh@@ own to the us@@ er were W , A , I , T , which , of course , sp@@ ell a wor@@ d ."
But the best part is the m@@ ess@@ age that the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o help des@@ k got about 2@@ 0 min@@ ut@@ es l@@ ater .
"T@@ ex@@ t : &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ p ! I &apos;ve been wa@@ iting for over 2@@ 0 min@@ ut@@ es , and no@@ thing happen@@ s . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they nee@@ ded to wa@@ it ."
"This of course , is not as b@@ ad as this po@@ or person ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A P@@ ro@@ j@@ ect is something that we did here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ l@@ on over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used every@@ where ."
"L@@ et me now tell you about a proj@@ ect that we did a few years l@@ ater , which is sort of the next ev@@ ol@@ ution of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"This is a proj@@ ect that we call re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , which is something that we started here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ on , then we tur@@ ned it into a star@@ tu@@ p comp@@ any ."
"And then about a year and a hal@@ f ago , G@@ oo@@ g@@ le actually ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red this comp@@ any ."
So let me tell you what this proj@@ ect started .
So this proj@@ ect started from the f@@ ol@@ low@@ ing re@@ aliz@@ ation : It tur@@ ns out that ap@@ pro@@ x@@ im@@ at@@ ely 20@@ 0 million C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are t@@ yp@@ ed every@@ day by people around the world .
"When I first he@@ ard this , I was quite pr@@ ou@@ d of my@@ self ."
"I thought , look at the imp@@ act that my re@@ sear@@ ch has had ."
But then I started fe@@ el@@ ing b@@ ad .
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , each time you t@@ yp@@ e a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , ess@@ enti@@ ally you wa@@ st@@ e 10 secon@@ ds of your time ."
"And if you m@@ ul@@ ti@@ p@@ ly that by 20@@ 0 million , you get that hum@@ an@@ ity as a whole is wa@@ st@@ ing about 5@@ 00@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s every day t@@ yp@@ ing these an@@ no@@ ying C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s ."
So then I started fe@@ el@@ ing b@@ ad .
"( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get ri@@ d of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s , because the sec@@ ur@@ ity of the We@@ b sort of de@@ p@@ en@@ ds on them ."
"But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this eff@@ ort for something that is good for hum@@ an@@ ity ?"
"So see , here &apos;s the thing ."
"W@@ hi@@ le you &apos;re t@@ yp@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , d@@ ur@@ ing those 10 secon@@ ds , your brain is doing something a@@ ma@@ zing ."
Y@@ our brain is doing something that compu@@ ters can@@ not ye@@ t do .
So can we get you to do us@@ e@@ ful work for those 10 secon@@ ds ?
"A@@ no@@ ther way of p@@ ut@@ ting it is , is there some hum@@ on@@ g@@ ous problem that we can@@ not ye@@ t get compu@@ ters to sol@@ ve , ye@@ t we can s@@ pl@@ it into t@@ in@@ y 10@@ -@@ second ch@@ un@@ ks s@@ uch that each time some@@ body sol@@ ves a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A they sol@@ ve a little bit of this problem ?"
"And the an@@ sw@@ er to that is &quot; &quot; y@@ es , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now ."
"So what you may not know is that no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays wh@@ i@@ le you &apos;re t@@ yp@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , not only are you au@@ th@@ enti@@ ca@@ ting y@@ our@@ self as a human , but in ad@@ di@@ tion you &apos;re actually hel@@ p@@ ing us to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze bo@@ o@@ ks ."
So let me ex@@ pla@@ in how this wor@@ ks .
So there &apos;s a lot of proj@@ ects out there trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze bo@@ o@@ ks .
G@@ oo@@ g@@ le has one . The In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t Ar@@ ch@@ i@@ ve has one .
"A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , now with the K@@ in@@ d@@ le , is trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze bo@@ o@@ ks ."
B@@ as@@ ically the way this wor@@ ks is you start with an old book .
"You &apos;ve se@@ en those things , right ? Li@@ ke a book ?"
"( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you s@@ can it ."
Now sc@@ an@@ ning a book is like ta@@ king a di@@ g@@ it@@ al ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h of every p@@ age of the book .
It gi@@ ves you an ima@@ ge for every p@@ age of the book .
This is an ima@@ ge with t@@ ex@@ t for every p@@ age of the book .
The next ste@@ p in the pro@@ cess is that the compu@@ ter nee@@ ds to be able to deci@@ ph@@ er all of the wor@@ ds in this ima@@ ge .
"That &apos;s using a technology called O@@ C@@ R , for op@@ tical ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ tion , which ta@@ kes a pic@@ ture of t@@ ex@@ t and tries to fi@@ g@@ ure out what t@@ ex@@ t is in there ."
Now the problem is that O@@ C@@ R is not per@@ f@@ ect .
"E@@ sp@@ eci@@ ally for ol@@ der bo@@ o@@ ks where the in@@ k has f@@ ad@@ ed and the p@@ ag@@ es have tur@@ ned y@@ el@@ low , O@@ C@@ R can@@ not re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e a lot of the wor@@ ds ."
"F@@ or example , for things that were wr@@ it@@ ten more than 5@@ 0 years ago , the compu@@ ter can@@ not re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e about 3@@ 0 percent of the wor@@ ds ."
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re ta@@ king all of the wor@@ ds that the compu@@ ter can@@ not re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e and we &apos;re getting people to re@@ ad them for us wh@@ i@@ le they &apos;re t@@ yp@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A on the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t .
"So the next time you t@@ yp@@ e a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , these wor@@ ds that you &apos;re t@@ yp@@ ing are actually wor@@ ds that are coming from bo@@ o@@ ks that are being di@@ gi@@ ti@@ z@@ ed that the compu@@ ter could not re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e ."
"And now the reas@@ on we have two wor@@ ds no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays in@@ ste@@ ad of one is because , you see , one of the wor@@ ds is a wor@@ d that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to pres@@ ent it to you ."
"But s@@ in@@ ce it doesn &apos;t know the an@@ sw@@ er for it , it can@@ not gra@@ de it for you ."
"So what we do is we give you another wor@@ d , one for which the system does know the an@@ sw@@ er ."
"We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , p@@ le@@ ase t@@ yp@@ e bot@@ h ."
"And if you t@@ yp@@ e the cor@@ rec@@ t wor@@ d for the one for which the system al@@ ready kno@@ ws the an@@ sw@@ er , it as@@ su@@ m@@ es you are human , and it also ge@@ ts some con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence that you t@@ yp@@ ed the other wor@@ d cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And if we re@@ pe@@ at this pro@@ cess to like 10 different people and all of them ag@@ ree on what the new wor@@ d is , then we get one more wor@@ d di@@ gi@@ ti@@ z@@ ed ac@@ cur@@ at@@ ely ."
So this is how the system wor@@ ks .
"And bas@@ ically , s@@ in@@ ce we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed it about three or four years ago , a lot of we@@ bs@@ it@@ es have started sw@@ it@@ ch@@ ing from the old C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people wa@@ st@@ ed their time to the new C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people are hel@@ p@@ ing to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze bo@@ o@@ ks ."
"So for example , T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ ma@@ ster ."
"So every time you bu@@ y tic@@ ke@@ ts on T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ ma@@ ster , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"F@@ ac@@ e@@ book : E@@ very time you ad@@ d a fri@@ end or po@@ ke some@@ body , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"T@@ w@@ it@@ ter and about 3@@ 50@@ ,000 other s@@ it@@ es are all using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"And in fact , the number of s@@ it@@ es that are using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A is so hi@@ gh that the number of wor@@ ds that we &apos;re di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing p@@ er day is really , really lar@@ ge ."
"It &apos;s about 10@@ 0 million a day , which is the e@@ qu@@ i@@ val@@ ent of about two and a hal@@ f million bo@@ o@@ ks a year ."
And this is all being done one wor@@ d at a time by just people t@@ yp@@ ing C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s on the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t .
"( Applause ) Now of course , s@@ in@@ ce we &apos;re doing so many wor@@ ds p@@ er day , f@@ un@@ n@@ y things can happ@@ en ."
And this is es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally tr@@ ue because now we &apos;re gi@@ ving people two r@@ and@@ om@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h wor@@ ds next to each other .
So f@@ un@@ n@@ y things can happ@@ en .
"F@@ or example , we pres@@ en@@ ted this wor@@ d ."
It &apos;s the wor@@ d &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s no@@ thing wr@@ ong with it .
"But if you pres@@ ent it al@@ ong with another r@@ and@@ om@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en wor@@ d , b@@ ad things can happ@@ en ."
"So we get this . ( T@@ ex@@ t : b@@ ad ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans ) But it &apos;s even wor@@ se , because the par@@ tic@@ ular we@@ bs@@ ite where we show@@ ed this actually happened to be called The E@@ mb@@ as@@ s@@ y of the K@@ ing@@ do@@ m of G@@ od ."
( Laughter ) O@@ op@@ s . ( Laughter )
H@@ ere &apos;s another really b@@ ad one .
Jo@@ h@@ n@@ E@@ d@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m ( T@@ ex@@ t : D@@ am@@ n li@@ b@@ er@@ al ) ( Laughter ) So we ke@@ ep on in@@ s@@ ul@@ ting people left and right every@@ day .
"Now , of course , we &apos;re not just in@@ s@@ ul@@ ting people ."
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , s@@ in@@ ce we &apos;re pres@@ en@@ ting two r@@ and@@ om@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en wor@@ ds , interesting things can happ@@ en ."
"So this actually has gi@@ ven ri@@ se to a really big In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t me@@ me that ten@@ s of thou@@ s@@ ands of people have par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated in , which is called C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A art ."
I &apos;m s@@ ure some of you have he@@ ard about it .
H@@ ere &apos;s how it wor@@ ks .
"I@@ ma@@ gine you &apos;re using the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t and you see a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A that you think is some@@ what p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar , like this C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A . ( T@@ ex@@ t : in@@ vi@@ sible to@@ a@@ ster ) Th@@ en what you &apos;re su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed to do is you take a sc@@ re@@ en sh@@ o@@ t of it ."
"Th@@ en of course , you f@@ ill out the C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A because you help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"But then , first you take a sc@@ re@@ en sh@@ o@@ t , and then you d@@ ra@@ w something that is re@@ l@@ ated to it ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it wor@@ ks .
There are ten@@ s of thou@@ s@@ ands of these .
S@@ ome of them are very c@@ ut@@ e . ( T@@ ex@@ t : cl@@ en@@ ch@@ ed it ) ( Laughter ) S@@ ome of them are f@@ un@@ ni@@ er .
"( T@@ ex@@ t : st@@ on@@ ed f@@ oun@@ d@@ ers ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like p@@ al@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ logi@@ cal sh@@ vi@@ s@@ le , they con@@ ta@@ in S@@ no@@ op Do@@ g@@ g . ( Laughter )@@ "
"O@@ k@@ ay , so this is my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite number of re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
So this is the fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite thing that I like about this whole proj@@ ect .
"This is the number of di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ t people that have hel@@ p@@ ed us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze at le@@ ast one wor@@ d out of a book through re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A : 75@@ 0 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation , has hel@@ p@@ ed us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge ."
And it is numb@@ ers like these that mo@@ tiv@@ ate my re@@ sear@@ ch ag@@ end@@ a .
"So the question that mo@@ tiv@@ ates my re@@ sear@@ ch is the f@@ ol@@ low@@ ing : I@@ f you look at hum@@ an@@ ity &apos;s lar@@ ge@@ -@@ sc@@ ale ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ em@@ ents , these really big things that hum@@ an@@ ity has g@@ ot@@ ten together and done hi@@ stor@@ ically — like for example , buil@@ ding the p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds of E@@ g@@ yp@@ t or the P@@ an@@ am@@ a C@@ an@@ al or p@@ ut@@ ting a man on the Mo@@ on — there is a cu@@ ri@@ ous fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people ."
"It &apos;s we@@ ir@@ d ; they were all done with about 1@@ 00@@ ,000 people ."
"And the reas@@ on for that is because , before the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t , co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ating more than 1@@ 00@@ ,000 people , let al@@ one p@@ ay@@ ing them , was ess@@ enti@@ ally imp@@ os@@ sible ."
"But now with the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t , I &apos;ve just sh@@ own you a proj@@ ect where we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten 75@@ 0 million people to help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge ."
"So the question that mo@@ tiv@@ ates my re@@ sear@@ ch is , if we can put a man on the Mo@@ on with 1@@ 00@@ ,000 , what can we do with 10@@ 0 million ?"
"So bas@@ ed on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different proj@@ ects that we &apos;ve been working on ."
L@@ et me tell you about one that I &apos;m most ex@@ c@@ ited about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been se@@ mi@@ -@@ qu@@ i@@ e@@ tly working on for the last year and a hal@@ f or so .
It ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t ye@@ t been la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed . It &apos;s called Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"S@@ in@@ ce it ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t been la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed , sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h !@@ "
"( Laughter ) Y@@ ea@@ h , I can tr@@ ust you &apos;ll do that ."
So this is the proj@@ ect . H@@ ere &apos;s how it started .
"It started with me pos@@ ing a question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ d@@ ent , Se@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
"O@@ k@@ ay , that &apos;s Se@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
So I pos@@ ed the question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ d@@ ent .
"B@@ y the way , you did he@@ ar me cor@@ rec@@ tly ; his last na@@ me is H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
So I pos@@ ed this question to him : How can we get 10@@ 0 million people tran@@ sl@@ ating the We@@ b into every ma@@ j@@ or l@@ an@@ gu@@ age for f@@ ree ?
"O@@ k@@ ay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , tran@@ sl@@ ating the We@@ b ."
So right now the We@@ b is par@@ ti@@ tion@@ ed into m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es .
A lar@@ ge fr@@ ac@@ tion of it is in En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h .
"If you don &apos;t know any En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h , you can &apos;t ac@@ cess it ."
"But there &apos;s lar@@ ge fr@@ ac@@ tions in other different l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es , and if you don &apos;t know those l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es , you can &apos;t ac@@ cess it ."
"So I would like to tran@@ sl@@ ate all of the We@@ b , or at le@@ ast most of the We@@ b , into every ma@@ j@@ or l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ."
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
"Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use compu@@ ters to tran@@ sl@@ ate ?"
Wh@@ y can &apos;t we use m@@ ach@@ ine tran@@ sl@@ ation ?
M@@ ach@@ ine tran@@ sl@@ ation no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays is star@@ ting to tran@@ sl@@ ate some s@@ ent@@ en@@ ces here and there .
Wh@@ y can &apos;t we use it to tran@@ sl@@ ate the whole We@@ b ?
W@@ ell the problem with that is that it &apos;s not ye@@ t good enough and it prob@@ ably w@@ on &apos;t be for the next 1@@ 5 to 2@@ 0 years .
It ma@@ kes a lot of mi@@ sta@@ kes .
"E@@ ven when it doesn &apos;t make a mi@@ sta@@ ke , s@@ in@@ ce it ma@@ kes so many mi@@ sta@@ kes , you don &apos;t know whe@@ ther to tr@@ ust it or not ."
So let me show you an example of something that was tran@@ sl@@ ated with a m@@ ach@@ ine .
Ac@@ tually it was a for@@ um p@@ ost .
It was some@@ body who was trying to as@@ k a question about J@@ a@@ va@@ S@@ cri@@ p@@ t .
It was tran@@ sl@@ ated from J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese into En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h .
So I &apos;ll just let you re@@ ad .
This person star@@ ts ap@@ o@@ logi@@ zing for the fact that it &apos;s tran@@ sl@@ ated with a compu@@ ter .
So the next s@@ ent@@ ence is is going to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to the question .
So he &apos;s just ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ing something .
"@@ Re@@ memb@@ er , it &apos;s a question about J@@ a@@ va@@ S@@ cri@@ p@@ t ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : A@@ t of@@ ten , the go@@ at@@ -@@ time in@@ st@@ all a er@@ ro@@ r is v@@ om@@ it . ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes the first part of the question ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : How many times like the w@@ ind , a po@@ le , and the d@@ ra@@ g@@ on ? ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite part of the question ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : This in@@ s@@ ult to fa@@ ther &apos;s st@@ ones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the en@@ ding , which is my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite part of the whole thing ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : P@@ le@@ ase ap@@ o@@ logi@@ ze for your stu@@ pi@@ d@@ ity . There are a many th@@ ank you . ) ( Laughter ) Ok@@ ay , so compu@@ ter tran@@ sl@@ ation , not ye@@ t good enough ."
So back to the question .
So we need people to tran@@ sl@@ ate the whole We@@ b .
"So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just p@@ ay people to do this ?"
We could p@@ ay pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al l@@ an@@ gu@@ age tran@@ sl@@ at@@ ors to tran@@ sl@@ ate the whole We@@ b .
We could do that .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , it would be ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve ."
"F@@ or example , tran@@ sl@@ ating a t@@ in@@ y , t@@ in@@ y fr@@ ac@@ tion of the whole We@@ b , Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a , into one other l@@ an@@ gu@@ age , Sp@@ an@@ ish ."
"W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a ex@@ i@@ sts in Sp@@ an@@ ish , but it &apos;s very small com@@ par@@ ed to the si@@ ze of En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h ."
It &apos;s about 2@@ 0 percent of the si@@ ze of En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h .
"If we wanted to tran@@ sl@@ ate the other 8@@ 0 percent into Sp@@ an@@ ish , it would c@@ ost at le@@ ast 5@@ 0 million doll@@ ars — and this is at even the most exp@@ lo@@ ited , out@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ ing country out there ."
So it would be very exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve .
So what we want to do is we want to get 10@@ 0 million people tran@@ sl@@ ating the We@@ b into every ma@@ j@@ or l@@ an@@ gu@@ age for f@@ ree .
"Now if this is what you want to do , you pret@@ ty qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly re@@ aliz@@ e you &apos;re going to ru@@ n into two pret@@ ty big h@@ ur@@ dl@@ es , two big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es ."
The first one is a l@@ ack of bil@@ in@@ gu@@ als .
So I don &apos;t even know if there ex@@ i@@ sts 10@@ 0 million people out there using the We@@ b who are bil@@ in@@ gu@@ al enough to help us tran@@ sl@@ ate .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to ru@@ n into is a l@@ ack of mo@@ tiv@@ ation .
How are we going to mo@@ tiv@@ ate people to actually tran@@ sl@@ ate the We@@ b for f@@ ree ?
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , you have to p@@ ay people to do this ."
So how are we going to mo@@ tiv@@ ate them to do it for f@@ ree ?
"Now when we were star@@ ting to think about this , we were b@@ lo@@ c@@ ked by these two things ."
"But then we re@@ aliz@@ ed , there &apos;s actually a way to sol@@ ve bot@@ h these proble@@ ms with the same sol@@ ution ."
There &apos;s a way to k@@ ill two b@@ ir@@ ds with one st@@ one .
"And that is to tran@@ s@@ form l@@ an@@ gu@@ age tran@@ sl@@ ation into something that mil@@ li@@ ons of people want to do , and that also hel@@ ps with the problem of l@@ ack of bil@@ in@@ gu@@ als , and that is l@@ an@@ gu@@ age e@@ du@@ cation ."
"So it tur@@ ns out that today , there are over 1.@@ 2 bil@@ lion people lear@@ ning a fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ."
"P@@ e@@ ople really , really want to lear@@ n a fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ."
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being for@@ c@@ ed to do so in school .
"F@@ or example , in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates al@@ one , there are over fi@@ ve million people who have pa@@ id over $ 50@@ 0 for so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to lear@@ n a new l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ."
"So people really , really want to lear@@ n a new l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ."
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a hal@@ f is a new we@@ bs@@ ite — it &apos;s called Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go — where the bas@@ ic idea is people lear@@ n a new l@@ an@@ gu@@ age for f@@ ree wh@@ i@@ le si@@ m@@ ul@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous@@ ly tran@@ sl@@ ating the We@@ b .
And so bas@@ ically they &apos;re lear@@ ning by doing .
"So the way this wor@@ ks is wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re a just a be@@ gin@@ n@@ er , we give you very , very si@@ mple s@@ ent@@ en@@ ces ."
"There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very si@@ mple s@@ ent@@ en@@ ces on the We@@ b ."
"We give you very , very si@@ mple s@@ ent@@ en@@ ces al@@ ong with what each wor@@ d means ."
"And as you tran@@ sl@@ ate them , and as you see how other people tran@@ sl@@ ate them , you start lear@@ ning the l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ."
"And as you get more and more ad@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ ed , we give you more and more comple@@ x s@@ ent@@ en@@ ces to tran@@ sl@@ ate ."
"But at all times , you &apos;re lear@@ ning by doing ."
Now the c@@ ra@@ z@@ y thing about this me@@ th@@ od is that it actually really wor@@ ks .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , people are really , really lear@@ ning a l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ."
"We &apos;re m@@ os@@ tly done buil@@ ding it , and now we &apos;re te@@ st@@ ing it ."
Pe@@ ople really can lear@@ n a l@@ an@@ gu@@ age with it .
And they lear@@ n it about as well as the le@@ ad@@ ing l@@ an@@ gu@@ age lear@@ ning so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
So people really do lear@@ n a l@@ an@@ gu@@ age .
"And not only do they lear@@ n it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting ."
"@@ Because you see with Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go , people are actually lear@@ ning with real cont@@ ent ."
"A@@ s op@@ pos@@ ed to lear@@ ning with ma@@ de@@ -@@ up s@@ ent@@ en@@ ces , people are lear@@ ning with real cont@@ ent , which is in@@ h@@ er@@ ently interesting ."
So people really do lear@@ n a l@@ an@@ gu@@ age .
"But per@@ h@@ ap@@ s more sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly , the tran@@ s@@ la@@ tions that we get from people using the s@@ ite , even th@@ ough they &apos;re just be@@ gin@@ n@@ ers , the tran@@ s@@ la@@ tions that we get are as ac@@ cur@@ ate as those of pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al l@@ an@@ gu@@ age tran@@ sl@@ at@@ ors , which is very sur@@ pri@@ sing ."
So let me show you one example .
This is a s@@ ent@@ ence that was tran@@ sl@@ ated from G@@ er@@ man into En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h .
The to@@ p is the G@@ er@@ man .
The mi@@ dd@@ le is an En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h tran@@ sl@@ ation that was done by some@@ body who was a pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h tran@@ sl@@ at@@ or who we pa@@ id 2@@ 0 c@@ ents a wor@@ d for this tran@@ sl@@ ation .
"And the bot@@ to@@ m is a tran@@ sl@@ ation by us@@ ers of Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go , n@@ one of wh@@ om k@@ new any G@@ er@@ man before they started using the s@@ ite ."
"You can see , it &apos;s pret@@ ty much per@@ f@@ ect ."
"Now of course , we pl@@ ay a tri@@ c@@ k here to make the tran@@ s@@ la@@ tions as good as pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al l@@ an@@ gu@@ age tran@@ sl@@ at@@ ors ."
We com@@ b@@ ine the tran@@ s@@ la@@ tions of m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple be@@ gin@@ n@@ ers to get the qu@@ ality of a sing@@ le pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al tran@@ sl@@ at@@ or .
"Now even th@@ ough we &apos;re com@@ b@@ in@@ ing the tran@@ s@@ la@@ tions , the s@@ ite actually can tran@@ sl@@ ate pret@@ ty f@@ ast ."
"So let me show you , this is our es@@ ti@@ mat@@ es of how f@@ ast we could tran@@ sl@@ ate Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a from En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h into Sp@@ an@@ ish ."
"@@ Re@@ memb@@ er , this is 5@@ 0 million doll@@ ar@@ s-@@ wor@@ th of val@@ ue ."
"So if we wanted to tran@@ sl@@ ate Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a into Sp@@ an@@ ish , we could do it in fi@@ ve we@@ e@@ ks with 1@@ 00@@ ,000 ac@@ tive us@@ ers ."
And we could do it in about 8@@ 0 h@@ our@@ s with a million ac@@ tive us@@ ers .
"S@@ in@@ ce all the proj@@ ects that my grou@@ p has wor@@ ked on so f@@ ar have g@@ ot@@ ten mil@@ li@@ ons of us@@ ers , we &apos;re hop@@ e@@ ful that we &apos;ll be able to tran@@ sl@@ ate ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly f@@ ast with this proj@@ ect ."
Now the thing that I &apos;m most ex@@ c@@ ited about with Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think this pro@@ vi@@ des a fa@@ ir bus@@ iness mo@@ de@@ l for l@@ an@@ gu@@ age e@@ du@@ cation .
"So here &apos;s the thing : The cur@@ r@@ ent bus@@ iness mo@@ de@@ l for l@@ an@@ gu@@ age e@@ du@@ cation is the stu@@ d@@ ent p@@ ays , and in par@@ tic@@ ular , the stu@@ d@@ ent p@@ ays R@@ os@@ et@@ t@@ a St@@ one 50@@ 0 doll@@ ars ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the cur@@ r@@ ent bus@@ iness mo@@ de@@ l .
The problem with this bus@@ iness mo@@ de@@ l is that 9@@ 5 percent of the world &apos;s p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation doesn &apos;t have 50@@ 0 doll@@ ars .
So it &apos;s ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly un@@ fa@@ ir to@@ war@@ ds the po@@ or .
This is t@@ ot@@ ally bi@@ as@@ ed to@@ war@@ ds the ri@@ ch .
"Now see , in Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go , because wh@@ i@@ le you lear@@ n you &apos;re actually cre@@ ating val@@ ue , you &apos;re tran@@ sl@@ ating stu@@ ff — which for example , we could ch@@ ar@@ ge some@@ body for tran@@ s@@ la@@ tions ."
So this is how we could mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze this .
"S@@ in@@ ce people are cre@@ ating val@@ ue wh@@ i@@ le they &apos;re lear@@ ning , they don &apos;t have to p@@ ay their money , they p@@ ay with their time ."
"But the ma@@ gi@@ cal thing here is that they &apos;re p@@ ay@@ ing with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been sp@@ ent any@@ ways lear@@ ning the l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ."
So the n@@ ice thing about Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think it pro@@ vi@@ des a fa@@ ir bus@@ iness mo@@ de@@ l — one that doesn &apos;t disc@@ ri@@ min@@ ate aga@@ in@@ st po@@ or people .
So here &apos;s the s@@ ite . Thank you .
( Applause ) So here &apos;s the s@@ ite .
"We ha@@ ven &apos;t ye@@ t la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed , but if you go there , you can si@@ g@@ n up to be part of our pri@@ v@@ ate be@@ t@@ a , which is prob@@ ably going to start in about three or four we@@ e@@ ks ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t ye@@ t la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed this Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"B@@ y the way , I &apos;m the one tal@@ king here , but actually Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go is the work of a really aw@@ es@@ ome te@@ am , some of wh@@ om are here ."
So th@@ ank you .
( Applause )
"In Ox@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 50@@ s , there was a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic do@@ ct@@ or , who was very un@@ us@@ u@@ al , n@@ am@@ ed A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ w@@ art ."
"And A@@ li@@ ce was un@@ us@@ u@@ al par@@ tly because , of course , she was a wom@@ an , which was pret@@ ty r@@ are in the 19@@ 50@@ s ."
"And she was b@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant , she was one of the , at the time , the y@@ oun@@ g@@ est F@@ el@@ low to be elec@@ ted to the Ro@@ y@@ al C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge of P@@ hy@@ s@@ ici@@ ans ."
"S@@ he was un@@ us@@ u@@ al too because she cont@@ in@@ u@@ ed to work after she got mar@@ ri@@ ed , after she had ki@@ ds , and even after she got di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed and was a sing@@ le par@@ ent , she cont@@ in@@ u@@ ed her medi@@ cal work ."
"And she was un@@ us@@ u@@ al because she was really interest@@ ed in a new sci@@ ence , the em@@ er@@ ging fi@@ el@@ d of e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ o@@ logy , the stu@@ dy of p@@ at@@ ter@@ ns in di@@ se@@ ase ."
"But like every sci@@ enti@@ st , she ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated that to make her mar@@ k , what she nee@@ ded to do was find a hard problem and sol@@ ve it ."
The hard problem that A@@ li@@ ce ch@@ ose was the ri@@ sing in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence of chil@@ dh@@ ood can@@ c@@ ers .
"M@@ ost di@@ se@@ ase is cor@@ re@@ l@@ ated with po@@ ver@@ ty , but in the ca@@ se of chil@@ dh@@ ood can@@ c@@ ers , the children who were d@@ ying se@@ em@@ ed m@@ os@@ tly to come from a@@ ff@@ l@@ u@@ ent fami@@ li@@ es ."
"So , what , she wanted to know , could ex@@ pla@@ in this an@@ om@@ al@@ y ?"
"Now , A@@ li@@ ce had tr@@ ou@@ ble getting f@@ und@@ ing for her re@@ sear@@ ch ."
"In the end , she got just 1@@ ,000 p@@ oun@@ ds from the L@@ ad@@ y T@@ at@@ a M@@ em@@ or@@ i@@ al pri@@ ze ."
And that me@@ ant she k@@ new she only had one sh@@ o@@ t at coll@@ ec@@ ting her data .
"Now , she had no idea what to look for ."
"This really was a ne@@ ed@@ le in a ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack sort of sear@@ ch , so she as@@ ked everything she could think of ."
H@@ ad the children e@@ at@@ en bo@@ il@@ ed s@@ we@@ e@@ ts ?
H@@ ad they con@@ su@@ m@@ ed co@@ lo@@ red dr@@ in@@ ks ?
D@@ id they e@@ at f@@ ish and ch@@ i@@ ps ?
D@@ id they have in@@ do@@ or or out@@ do@@ or pl@@ umb@@ ing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
"And when her car@@ b@@ on c@@ op@@ i@@ ed ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ir@@ e started to come back , one thing and one thing only ju@@ mp@@ ed out with the sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cal cl@@ ar@@ ity of a kind that most sci@@ enti@@ sts can only dre@@ am of ."
"B@@ y a r@@ ate of two to one , the children who had di@@ ed had had mo@@ th@@ ers who had been X-@@ ra@@ y@@ ed when pre@@ gn@@ ant ."
Now that fin@@ ding f@@ le@@ w in the face of con@@ v@@ en@@ tional w@@ is@@ do@@ m .
"C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tional w@@ is@@ do@@ m hel@@ d that everything was sa@@ fe up to a point , a th@@ re@@ sh@@ old ."
"It f@@ le@@ w in the face of con@@ v@@ en@@ tional w@@ is@@ do@@ m , which was hu@@ ge en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ as@@ m for the c@@ ool new technology of that age , which was the X-@@ r@@ ay m@@ ach@@ ine ."
"And it f@@ le@@ w in the face of do@@ ct@@ ors &apos; idea of the@@ m@@ selves , which was as people who hel@@ p@@ ed pa@@ ti@@ ents , they didn &apos;t h@@ ar@@ m them ."
"N@@ e@@ ver@@ the@@ less , A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ w@@ art r@@ us@@ h@@ ed to publi@@ s@@ h her pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary fin@@ d@@ ings in The L@@ an@@ c@@ et in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"P@@ e@@ ople got very ex@@ c@@ ited , there was talk of the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze , and A@@ li@@ ce really was in a big h@@ ur@@ ry to try to stu@@ dy all the ca@@ ses of chil@@ dh@@ ood can@@ c@@ er she could find before they dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed ."
"In fact , she need not have h@@ ur@@ ri@@ ed ."
It was ful@@ ly 2@@ 5 years before the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ s@@ h and medi@@ cal — B@@ ri@@ ti@@ s@@ h and Am@@ eri@@ can medi@@ cal est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ m@@ ents ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed the pr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ce of X-@@ ra@@ ying pre@@ gn@@ ant women .
"The data was out there , it was op@@ en , it was f@@ re@@ ely a@@ va@@ il@@ able , but no@@ body wanted to know ."
"@@ A chil@@ d a we@@ e@@ k was d@@ ying , but no@@ thing chan@@ ged ."
Op@@ en@@ n@@ ess al@@ one can &apos;t dri@@ ve change .
So for 2@@ 5 years A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ w@@ art had a very big fi@@ ght on her h@@ ands .
"So , how did she know that she was right ?"
"Well , she had a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic mo@@ de@@ l for thinking ."
"S@@ he wor@@ ked with a sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ an n@@ am@@ ed Ge@@ or@@ ge K@@ ne@@ ale , and Ge@@ or@@ ge was pret@@ ty much everything that A@@ li@@ ce w@@ as@@ n &apos;t ."
"So , A@@ li@@ ce was very out@@ going and soci@@ able , and Ge@@ or@@ ge was a re@@ cl@@ use ."
"A@@ li@@ ce was very war@@ m , very e@@ mp@@ a@@ the@@ tic with her pa@@ ti@@ ents ."
Ge@@ or@@ ge fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly pre@@ f@@ er@@ red numb@@ ers to people .
But he said this f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic thing about their working re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p .
"H@@ e said , &quot; &quot; M@@ y jo@@ b is to pro@@ ve Dr@@ . S@@ te@@ w@@ art wr@@ ong . &quot; &quot; He ac@@ ti@@ ve@@ ly s@@ ou@@ ght dis@@ con@@ fir@@ ma@@ tion ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent ways of looking at her mo@@ d@@ el@@ s , at her sta@@ ti@@ s@@ tic@@ s , different ways of cr@@ un@@ ch@@ ing the data in or@@ der to dis@@ pro@@ ve her ."
He sa@@ w his jo@@ b as cre@@ ating con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ t around her the@@ or@@ ies .
"@@ Because it was only by not being able to pro@@ ve that she was wr@@ ong , that Ge@@ or@@ ge could give A@@ li@@ ce the con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence she nee@@ ded to know that she was right ."
It &apos;s a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic mo@@ de@@ l of coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation — thinking par@@ tn@@ ers who ar@@ en &apos;t ech@@ o c@@ ha@@ mb@@ ers .
"I w@@ on@@ der how many of us have , or d@@ are to have , s@@ uch coll@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ors ."
A@@ li@@ ce and Ge@@ or@@ ge were very good at con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ t .
They sa@@ w it as thinking .
So what does that kind of con@@ struc@@ tive con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ t re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e ?
"Well , first of all , it re@@ qu@@ i@@ res that we find people who are very different from our@@ selves ."
"That means we have to re@@ si@@ st the ne@@ u@@ ro@@ bi@@ o@@ logi@@ cal dri@@ ve , which means that we really pre@@ f@@ er people m@@ os@@ tly like our@@ selves , and it means we have to see@@ k out people with different bac@@ k@@ gr@@ oun@@ ds , different di@@ sci@@ pl@@ in@@ es , different ways of thinking and different experi@@ ence , and find ways to en@@ g@@ age with them ."
That re@@ qu@@ i@@ res a lot of pa@@ ti@@ ence and a lot of energy .
"And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love ."
Because you si@@ mp@@ ly w@@ on &apos;t comm@@ it that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really c@@ are .
And it also means that we have to be pre@@ par@@ ed to change our min@@ ds .
"A@@ li@@ ce &apos;s d@@ aughter to@@ ld me that every time A@@ li@@ ce went he@@ ad@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ he@@ ad with a f@@ el@@ low sci@@ enti@@ st , they made her think and think and think again ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; M@@ y mo@@ ther , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; M@@ y mo@@ ther didn &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y a fi@@ ght , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p ."
"But it stri@@ kes me that the bi@@ gg@@ est proble@@ ms we face , many of the bi@@ gg@@ est di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers that we &apos;ve experi@@ en@@ c@@ ed , m@@ os@@ tly ha@@ ven &apos;t come from in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als , they &apos;ve come from organ@@ iz@@ ations , some of them bi@@ gg@@ er than coun@@ tries , many of them cap@@ able of a@@ ff@@ ec@@ ting h@@ und@@ re@@ ds , thou@@ s@@ ands , even mil@@ li@@ ons of li@@ ves ."
So how do organ@@ iz@@ ations think ?
"Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t ."
"And that is@@ n &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t ."
And they can &apos;t because the people in@@ side of them are too af@@ ra@@ id of con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ t .
"In sur@@ ve@@ ys of Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an and Am@@ eri@@ can ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ti@@ ves , ful@@ ly 8@@ 5 percent of them ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ged that they had is@@ su@@ es or con@@ cer@@ ns at work that they were af@@ ra@@ id to ra@@ i@@ se ."
"A@@ f@@ ra@@ id of the con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ t that that would pro@@ vo@@ ke , af@@ ra@@ id to get em@@ b@@ ro@@ il@@ ed in ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents that they did not know how to man@@ age , and f@@ el@@ t that they were b@@ ound to l@@ ose ."
Ei@@ gh@@ t@@ y-@@ fi@@ ve percent is a really big number .
It means that organ@@ iz@@ ations m@@ os@@ tly can &apos;t do what Ge@@ or@@ ge and A@@ li@@ ce so tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ an@@ tly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
"And it means that people like many of us , who have ru@@ n organ@@ iz@@ ations , and g@@ one out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , m@@ os@@ tly fa@@ il to get the best out of them ."
So how do we devel@@ op the sk@@ ill@@ s that we need ?
"@@ Because it does take sk@@ ill and pr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ce , too ."
"If we ar@@ en &apos;t going to be af@@ ra@@ id of con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ t , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it ."
"So , rec@@ ently , I wor@@ ked with an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive n@@ am@@ ed Jo@@ e , and Jo@@ e wor@@ ked for a medi@@ cal de@@ v@@ ice comp@@ any ."
And Jo@@ e was very wor@@ ri@@ ed about the de@@ v@@ ice that he was working on .
He thought that it was too comp@@ li@@ ca@@ ted and he thought that its comple@@ x@@ ity cre@@ ated mar@@ gin@@ s of er@@ ro@@ r that could really h@@ ur@@ t people .
He was af@@ ra@@ id of doing da@@ ma@@ ge to the pa@@ ti@@ ents he was trying to help .
"But when he loo@@ ked around his organ@@ iz@@ ation , no@@ body el@@ se se@@ em@@ ed to be at all wor@@ ri@@ ed ."
"So , he didn &apos;t really want to say any@@ thing ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , maybe they k@@ new something he didn &apos;t ."
M@@ ay@@ be he &apos;d look stu@@ p@@ id .
"But he ke@@ p@@ t wor@@ r@@ ying about it , and he wor@@ ri@@ ed about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was lea@@ ve a jo@@ b he lo@@ ved ."
"In the end , Jo@@ e and I found a way for him to ra@@ i@@ se his con@@ cer@@ ns ."
And what happened then is what al@@ most always happen@@ s in this s@@ it@@ u@@ ation .
It tur@@ ned out every@@ body had ex@@ ac@@ tly the same ques@@ tions and d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts .
So now Jo@@ e had al@@ li@@ es . They could think together .
"And y@@ es , there was a lot of con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ t and de@@ b@@ ate and ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent , but that al@@ low@@ ed every@@ one around the t@@ able to be cre@@ a@@ tive , to sol@@ ve the problem , and to change the de@@ v@@ ice ."
"J@@ o@@ e was what a lot of people might think of as a wh@@ i@@ st@@ le@@ -@@ b@@ low@@ er , ex@@ cep@@ t that like al@@ most all wh@@ i@@ st@@ le@@ -@@ b@@ low@@ ers , he w@@ as@@ n &apos;t a cr@@ ank at all , he was p@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ at@@ ely de@@ v@@ ot@@ ed to the organ@@ iz@@ ation and the high@@ er p@@ ur@@ pos@@ es that that organ@@ iz@@ ation ser@@ ved ."

And his col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es don &apos;t think of him as a cr@@ ank .
They think of him as a le@@ ad@@ er .
"So , how do we have these con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions more e@@ as@@ i@@ ly and more of@@ ten ?"
"Well , the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of D@@ el@@ ft re@@ qu@@ i@@ res that its Ph@@ D stu@@ d@@ ents have to su@@ bm@@ it fi@@ ve st@@ at@@ em@@ ents that they &apos;re pre@@ par@@ ed to de@@ f@@ end ."

"I think we need to be te@@ ach@@ ing these sk@@ ill@@ s to ki@@ ds and ad@@ ul@@ ts at every st@@ age of their develop@@ ment , if we want to have thinking organ@@ iz@@ ations and a thinking soci@@ e@@ ty ."
The fact is that most of the bi@@ gg@@ est ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ ph@@ es that we &apos;ve w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed r@@ ar@@ ely come from information that is sec@@ re@@ t or hi@@ dd@@ en .

You had to re@@ gi@@ ster a sa@@ mple sh@@ e@@ et of t@@ ex@@ t out of the ty@@ pe@@ wr@@ it@@ er .

"And we in the W@@ est cou@@ ldn &apos;t understand how any@@ body could do this , how much this would re@@ stri@@ c@@ t f@@ re@@ e@@ do@@ m of spe@@ ec@@ h ."

"And this is an example of the ways that our own gover@@ n@@ m@@ ents are using technology aga@@ in@@ st us , the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ s ."

"If we take a look at what &apos;s really happen@@ ing in the on@@ line world , we can grou@@ p the at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks bas@@ ed on the at@@ t@@ ac@@ k@@ ers ."

"We actually have se@@ ver@@ al ca@@ ses of mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res on@@ line , m@@ ul@@ ti@@ mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res , who made money with their at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks ."
H@@ ere &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir T@@ sa@@ st@@ s@@ in form T@@ ar@@ t@@ u in E@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ a .

"This is M@@ at@@ the@@ w An@@ der@@ son , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ Da@@ our and so on and so on ."
"Th@@ ese gu@@ ys make their for@@ t@@ un@@ es on@@ line , but they make it through the il@@ le@@ g@@ al means of using things like b@@ an@@ king t@@ ro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts wh@@ i@@ le we do on@@ line b@@ an@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers to coll@@ ect our cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard information wh@@ i@@ le we are doing on@@ line sh@@ opp@@ ing from an in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted compu@@ ter ."
"The U.@@ S@@ . S@@ ec@@ re@@ t S@@ er@@ v@@ ice , two mon@@ ths ago , f@@ ro@@ ze the S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t of Mr@@ . S@@ am J@@ a@@ in right here , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 14@@ .@@ 9 million U.@@ S@@ . doll@@ ars on it when it was f@@ ro@@ z@@ en ."
Mr@@ . J@@ a@@ in hi@@ m@@ self is on the lo@@ ose ; no@@ body kno@@ ws where he is .
And I cl@@ ai@@ m it &apos;s al@@ ready today that it &apos;s more li@@ ke@@ ly for any of us to become the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of a cri@@ me on@@ line than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very ob@@ vi@@ ous that this is only going to get wor@@ se .
"In the future , the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of cri@@ me will be happen@@ ing on@@ line ."
The second ma@@ j@@ or grou@@ p of at@@ t@@ ac@@ k@@ ers that we are w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing today are not mo@@ tiv@@ ated by money .
"They &apos;re mo@@ tiv@@ ated by something el@@ se — mo@@ tiv@@ ated by prot@@ est@@ s , mo@@ tiv@@ ated by an op@@ in@@ i@@ on , mo@@ tiv@@ ated by the l@@ augh@@ s ."
Gr@@ ou@@ ps like An@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous have ri@@ s@@ en up over the last 1@@ 2 mon@@ ths and have become a ma@@ j@@ or pl@@ ay@@ er in the fi@@ el@@ d of on@@ line at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks .
"So those are the three ma@@ in at@@ t@@ ac@@ k@@ ers : cri@@ min@@ als who do it for the money , h@@ ac@@ k@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like An@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous doing it for the prot@@ est , but then the last grou@@ p are n@@ ation st@@ ates , gover@@ n@@ m@@ ents doing the at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks ."
And then we look at ca@@ ses like what happened in Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a pri@@ me example of what happen@@ s when gover@@ n@@ m@@ ents at@@ t@@ ack aga@@ in@@ st their own ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ s .
"D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ te Au@@ th@@ or@@ ity from The Ne@@ ther@@ l@@ ands — or actually , it was ."
It was r@@ un@@ ning into b@@ an@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ cy last f@@ all because they were h@@ ac@@ ked into .
S@@ om@@ e@@ body b@@ ro@@ ke in and they h@@ ac@@ ked it th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly .
"And I as@@ ked last we@@ e@@ k in a me@@ e@@ ting with D@@ ut@@ ch gover@@ n@@ ment re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves , I as@@ ked one of the le@@ ad@@ ers of the te@@ am whe@@ ther he found pla@@ us@@ i@@ ble that people di@@ ed because of the Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar h@@ ack ."
And his an@@ sw@@ er was y@@ es .
So how do people di@@ e as the res@@ ult of a h@@ ack like this ?
W@@ ell Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C.@@ A@@ .
They s@@ ell cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ t@@ es .
What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ t@@ es ?
"Well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ te if you have a we@@ bs@@ ite that has h@@ tt@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted ser@@ v@@ ic@@ es , ser@@ v@@ ic@@ es like G@@ ma@@ il ."
"Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ ma@@ il or one of their com@@ pe@@ ti@@ t@@ ors , but these ser@@ v@@ ic@@ es are es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally p@@ op@@ ular in t@@ ot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an st@@ ates like Ir@@ an , where dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents use fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n ser@@ v@@ ic@@ es like G@@ ma@@ il because they know they are more tr@@ u@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y than the lo@@ cal ser@@ v@@ ic@@ es and they are en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L con@@ nec@@ tions , so the lo@@ cal gover@@ n@@ ment can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their disc@@ us@@ si@@ ons ."
Ex@@ cep@@ t they can if they h@@ ack into a fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n C.@@ A@@ .
and is@@ su@@ e ro@@ gu@@ e cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ t@@ es .
And this is ex@@ ac@@ tly what happened with the ca@@ se of Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
"Wh@@ at about A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happen@@ ing , for example , in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t ?"
"Well in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of the E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ an sec@@ re@@ t poli@@ ce in Ap@@ ri@@ l 20@@ 1@@ 1 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the buil@@ ding they found l@@ ots of p@@ ap@@ ers ."
"A@@ m@@ ong those p@@ ap@@ ers , was this b@@ in@@ der enti@@ tl@@ ed &quot; &quot; F@@ IN@@ F@@ IS@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And with@@ in that b@@ in@@ der were n@@ ot@@ es from a comp@@ any bas@@ ed in G@@ er@@ many which had so@@ ld the E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ an gover@@ n@@ ment a se@@ t of to@@ ol@@ s for inter@@ cep@@ ting — and in very lar@@ ge sc@@ ale — all the comm@@ uni@@ cation of the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ s of the country ."
"They had so@@ ld this to@@ o@@ l for 2@@ 80@@ ,000 Eu@@ ro@@ s to the E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ an gover@@ n@@ ment ."
The comp@@ any he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters are right here .
So W@@ est@@ er@@ n gover@@ n@@ m@@ ents are pro@@ vi@@ ding t@@ ot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an gover@@ n@@ m@@ ents with to@@ ol@@ s to do this aga@@ in@@ st their own ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ s .
But W@@ est@@ er@@ n gover@@ n@@ m@@ ents are doing it to the@@ m@@ selves as well .
"F@@ or example , in G@@ er@@ many , just a cou@@ ple of we@@ e@@ ks ago the so@@ -@@ called St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a t@@ ro@@ j@@ an used by G@@ er@@ man gover@@ n@@ ment off@@ ici@@ als to inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate their own ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ s ."
"If you are a s@@ us@@ p@@ ect in a cri@@ min@@ al ca@@ se , well it &apos;s pret@@ ty ob@@ vi@@ ous , your ph@@ one will be t@@ app@@ ed ."
"But today , it go@@ es be@@ y@@ on@@ d that ."
They will ta@@ p your In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t con@@ nec@@ tion .
"They will even use to@@ ol@@ s like St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an to in@@ f@@ ect your compu@@ ter with a t@@ ro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ab@@ l@@ es them to w@@ at@@ ch all your comm@@ uni@@ cation , to li@@ st@@ en to your on@@ line disc@@ us@@ si@@ ons , to coll@@ ect your p@@ as@@ s@@ wor@@ ds ."
"Now when we think de@@ ep@@ er about things like these , the ob@@ vi@@ ous resp@@ on@@ se from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Ok@@ ay , that s@@ oun@@ ds b@@ ad , but that doesn &apos;t really a@@ ff@@ ect me because I &apos;m a le@@ g@@ al ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ."
Wh@@ y should I wor@@ ry ?
"@@ Because I have no@@ thing to hi@@ de . &quot; &quot; And this is an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent , which doesn &apos;t make sense ."
P@@ ri@@ v@@ ac@@ y is imp@@ li@@ ed .
P@@ ri@@ v@@ ac@@ y is not up for disc@@ us@@ sion .
This is not a question between pri@@ v@@ ac@@ y aga@@ in@@ st sec@@ ur@@ ity .
It &apos;s a question of f@@ re@@ e@@ do@@ m aga@@ in@@ st cont@@ ro@@ l .
"And wh@@ i@@ le we might tr@@ ust our gover@@ n@@ m@@ ents right now , right here in 20@@ 1@@ 1 , any right we give away will be gi@@ ven away for good ."
"And do we tr@@ ust , do we bl@@ in@@ d@@ ly tr@@ ust , any future gover@@ n@@ ment , a gover@@ n@@ ment we might have 5@@ 0 years from now ?"
And these are the ques@@ tions that we have to wor@@ ry about for the next 5@@ 0 years .
We re@@ ta@@ in just 2@@ 5 percent of what we he@@ ar .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying m@@ und@@ an@@ e s@@ oun@@ ds .

"Now s@@ ound is my p@@ as@@ sion , it &apos;s my life ."
( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( Applause ) ( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to spe@@ a@@ k today about the re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p between sci@@ ence and human val@@ u@@ es .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally underst@@ ood that ques@@ tions of mor@@ ality — ques@@ tions of good and e@@ vi@@ l and right and wr@@ ong — are ques@@ tions about which sci@@ ence off@@ ici@@ ally has no op@@ in@@ i@@ on ."
"It &apos;s thought that sci@@ ence can help us get what we val@@ ue , but it can never tell us what we ou@@ ght to val@@ ue ."
"And , con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , most people — I think most people prob@@ ably here — think that sci@@ ence will never an@@ sw@@ er the most important ques@@ tions in human life : ques@@ tions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th li@@ ving for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ sti@@ tu@@ t@@ es a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to ar@@ gu@@ e that this is an ill@@ us@@ i@@ on — that the se@@ par@@ ation between sci@@ ence and human val@@ u@@ es is an ill@@ us@@ i@@ on — and actually quite a d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous one at this point in human hi@@ story ."
"Now , it &apos;s of@@ ten said that sci@@ ence can@@ not give us a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for mor@@ ality and human val@@ u@@ es , because sci@@ ence de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ u@@ es see@@ m to be@@ long to different sp@@ h@@ er@@ es ."
It &apos;s of@@ ten thought that there &apos;s no des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ou@@ ght to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ tr@@ ue .
V@@ al@@ u@@ es are a cer@@ ta@@ in kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ at@@ u@@ res .
Wh@@ y is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ th@@ i@@ cal ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tions to@@ w@@ ard ro@@ c@@ ks ?
Wh@@ y don &apos;t we feel comp@@ as@@ sion for ro@@ c@@ ks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ c@@ ks can su@@ ff@@ er . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our f@@ el@@ low pri@@ mat@@ es than we are about in@@ s@@ ects , as in@@ de@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ pos@@ ed to a gre@@ ater r@@ an@@ ge of p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al happ@@ iness and su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing ."
"Now , the cr@@ uc@@ i@@ al thing to no@@ ti@@ ce here is that this is a fac@@ tu@@ al cl@@ ai@@ m : This is something that we could be right or wr@@ ong about . And if we have m@@ is@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed the re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p between bi@@ o@@ logi@@ cal comple@@ x@@ ity and the pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties of experi@@ ence well then we could be wr@@ ong about the in@@ n@@ er li@@ ves of in@@ s@@ ects ."
"And there &apos;s no no@@ tion , no ver@@ sion of human mor@@ ality and human val@@ u@@ es that I &apos;ve ever come ac@@ r@@ oss that is not at some point re@@ duc@@ i@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about con@@ sci@@ ous experi@@ ence and its pos@@ sible chan@@ ges ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ u@@ es from re@@ li@@ gi@@ on , even if you think that good and e@@ vi@@ l ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely re@@ l@@ ate to con@@ di@@ tions after de@@ ath — ei@@ ther to an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of happ@@ iness with G@@ od or an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess and its chan@@ ges ."
"And to say that s@@ uch chan@@ ges can per@@ si@@ st after de@@ ath is it@@ self a fac@@ tu@@ al cl@@ ai@@ m , which , of course , may or may not be tr@@ ue ."
"Now , to spe@@ a@@ k about the con@@ di@@ tions of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a cont@@ in@@ u@@ um of s@@ uch fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s pos@@ sible to live in a fa@@ il@@ ed st@@ ate , where everything that can go wr@@ ong does go wr@@ ong — where mo@@ th@@ ers can@@ not fe@@ ed their children , where str@@ an@@ g@@ ers can@@ not find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation , where people are m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in@@ disc@@ ri@@ min@@ at@@ ely ."
"And we know that it &apos;s pos@@ sible to mo@@ ve al@@ ong this cont@@ in@@ u@@ um to@@ war@@ ds something quite a bit more id@@ yl@@ li@@ c , to a place where a con@@ f@@ er@@ ence like this is even con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wr@@ ong an@@ sw@@ ers to how to mo@@ ve in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a to the water be a good idea ?
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for every@@ one to believe in the e@@ vi@@ l ey@@ e , so that when b@@ ad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely b@@ la@@ me their ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors ? P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not ."
"There are tr@@ u@@ ths to be kno@@ wn about how human comm@@ uni@@ ties fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ s@@ h , whe@@ ther or not we understand these tr@@ u@@ ths ."
And mor@@ ality re@@ l@@ ates to these tr@@ u@@ ths .
"So , in tal@@ king about val@@ u@@ es we are tal@@ king about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our s@@ it@@ u@@ ation in the world can be underst@@ ood at many le@@ vel@@ s — from the le@@ vel of the gen@@ ome on up to the le@@ vel of econom@@ ic sy@@ st@@ ems and poli@@ tical ar@@ r@@ an@@ ge@@ m@@ ents ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being we are , of nec@@ ess@@ ity , tal@@ king about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experi@@ ence of the world and of our@@ selves with@@ in it is re@@ aliz@@ ed in the brain — wh@@ at@@ ever happen@@ s after de@@ ath .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ ici@@ de b@@ om@@ b@@ er does get 7@@ 2 vir@@ gin@@ s in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his per@@ s@@ on@@ ality — his ra@@ ther un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ate per@@ s@@ on@@ ality — is the produc@@ t of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions of cul@@ ture — if cul@@ ture chan@@ ges us , as in@@ de@@ ed it does , it chan@@ ges us by chan@@ ging our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ ef@@ ore wh@@ at@@ ever cul@@ tur@@ al v@@ ari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ s@@ h can , at le@@ ast in pr@@ in@@ ci@@ ple , be underst@@ ood in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a mat@@ ur@@ ing sci@@ ence of the m@@ ind — ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logy , et@@ c ."

"( Laughter ) No@@ ti@@ ce that the fact that the con@@ cep@@ t of heal@@ th is op@@ en , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely op@@ en for re@@ vi@@ sion , does not make it v@@ ac@@ u@@ ous ."
The di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tion between a heal@@ th@@ y person and a de@@ ad one is about as c@@ le@@ ar and con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al as any we make in sci@@ ence .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to no@@ ti@@ ce is there may be many pe@@ a@@ ks on the mor@@ al l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e : There may be e@@ qu@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be e@@ qu@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to organ@@ iz@@ e a human soci@@ e@@ ty so as to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing .

W@@ ell think of how we talk about food : I would never be te@@ mp@@ ted to ar@@ gu@@ e to you that there m@@ ust be one right food to e@@ at .

M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a uni@@ ver@@ s@@ al mor@@ ality would re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e mor@@ al pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ m@@ it of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .

The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .

C@@ on@@ si@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ di@@ es : What to do about them ?

What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ pres@@ ents a pe@@ a@@ k of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing ?

"P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not . O@@ K , so per@@ h@@ ap@@ s there &apos;s some place on the spec@@ tr@@ um between these two ex@@ tre@@ m@@ es that re@@ pres@@ ents a place of better b@@ al@@ ance ."

But the thing to no@@ ti@@ ce is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ a@@ k .
"Now the ir@@ on@@ y , from my per@@ spec@@ tive , is that the only people who see@@ m to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wr@@ ong an@@ sw@@ ers to mor@@ al ques@@ tions are re@@ li@@ gi@@ ous de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es of one form or another ."

But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : We need a uni@@ ver@@ s@@ al con@@ cep@@ tion of human val@@ u@@ es .
"Now , what st@@ ands in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to no@@ ti@@ ce is that we do something different when tal@@ king about mor@@ ality — es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally sec@@ ular , a@@ ca@@ de@@ mi@@ c , sci@@ enti@@ st t@@ yp@@ es ."
Wh@@ en tal@@ king about mor@@ ality we val@@ ue differ@@ en@@ ces of op@@ in@@ i@@ on in a way that we don &apos;t in any other are@@ a of our li@@ ves .

I can@@ not believe I &apos;m here .
I have not s@@ le@@ p@@ t in we@@ e@@ ks .

"B@@ ack in about 2@@ 000 , I was li@@ ving in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ l@@ y@@ n , I was trying to fin@@ ish my first book , I was w@@ and@@ er@@ ing around da@@ z@@ ed every day because I wr@@ ot@@ e from 1@@ 2 a@@ .@@ m@@ . to 5 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
So I would wal@@ k around in a da@@ ze d@@ ur@@ ing the day .
"I had no m@@ ent@@ al ac@@ u@@ ity to spe@@ a@@ k of d@@ ur@@ ing the day , but I had f@@ le@@ xi@@ ble h@@ our@@ s ."
"In the B@@ ro@@ ok@@ l@@ y@@ n ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood that I li@@ ved in , P@@ ar@@ k S@@ lo@@ p@@ e , there are a lot of wr@@ it@@ ers — it &apos;s like a very hi@@ gh p@@ er cap@@ it@@ a ra@@ ti@@ o of wr@@ it@@ ers to n@@ or@@ ma@@ l people ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ wh@@ i@@ le , I had gro@@ wn up around a lot of te@@ ach@@ ers ."
"M@@ y mo@@ m was a te@@ ac@@ her , my si@@ ster be@@ came a te@@ ac@@ her and after col@@ le@@ ge so many of my fri@@ en@@ ds went into te@@ ach@@ ing ."
"And so I was always he@@ ar@@ ing them talk about their li@@ ves and how in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing they were , and they were really sort of the most h@@ ar@@ d-@@ working and con@@ st@@ an@@ tly in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing people I k@@ new ."
"But I k@@ new so many of the things they were up aga@@ in@@ st , so many of the str@@ u@@ gg@@ l@@ es they were de@@ al@@ ing with ."
"And one of them was that so many of my fri@@ en@@ ds that were te@@ ach@@ ing in city sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s were ha@@ ving tr@@ ou@@ ble with their stu@@ d@@ ents ke@@ ep@@ ing up at gra@@ de le@@ vel , in their read@@ ing and wr@@ iting in par@@ tic@@ ular ."
"Now , so many of these stu@@ d@@ ents had come from h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ ds where En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h is@@ n &apos;t sp@@ ok@@ en in the home , where a lot of them have different sp@@ eci@@ al nee@@ ds , lear@@ ning dis@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties . And of course they &apos;re working in sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s which some@@ times and very of@@ ten are under@@ -@@ f@@ und@@ ed ."
"And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bo@@ di@@ es , more on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion , more h@@ our@@ s , more exper@@ ti@@ se from people that have sk@@ ill@@ s in En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h and can work with these stu@@ d@@ ents on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , why don &apos;t you just work with them on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , we have fi@@ ve cl@@ as@@ ses of 3@@ 0 to 4@@ 0 stu@@ d@@ ents each ."
"This can le@@ ad up to 15@@ 0 , 18@@ 0 , 20@@ 0 stu@@ d@@ ents a day ."
How can we pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly give each stu@@ d@@ ent even one h@@ our a we@@ e@@ k of on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to gre@@ at@@ ly m@@ ul@@ ti@@ p@@ ly the wor@@ k@@ we@@ e@@ k and cl@@ one the te@@ ach@@ ers .
And so we started tal@@ king about this .
"And at the same time , I thought about this ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve grou@@ p of people I k@@ new : wr@@ it@@ ers , ed@@ it@@ ors , j@@ our@@ n@@ ali@@ sts , gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ d@@ ents , as@@ si@@ st@@ ant pro@@ f@@ ess@@ ors , you na@@ me it ."
"A@@ ll these people that had sort of f@@ le@@ xi@@ ble da@@ i@@ ly h@@ our@@ s and an inter@@ est in the En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h wor@@ d — I hop@@ e to have an inter@@ est in the En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h l@@ an@@ gu@@ age , but I &apos;m not spe@@ a@@ king it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That c@@ lo@@ c@@ k has got me ."
"But every@@ one that I k@@ new had an inter@@ est in the pri@@ m@@ ac@@ y of the wr@@ it@@ ten wor@@ d in ter@@ ms of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing a de@@ mo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y , n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing an en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed life ."
"And so they had , you know , their time and their inter@@ est , but at the same time there w@@ as@@ n &apos;t a con@@ du@@ it that I k@@ new of in my comm@@ unity to br@@ ing these two comm@@ uni@@ ties together ."
"So when I mo@@ ved back to S@@ an Fr@@ an@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , we r@@ en@@ ted this buil@@ ding ."
"And the idea was to put Mc@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s — Mc@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s Qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly , that we publi@@ sh@@ ed tw@@ ice or three times a year , and a few other ma@@ ga@@ z@@ in@@ es — we were going to mo@@ ve it into an off@@ ice for the first time ."
It used to be in my k@@ it@@ ch@@ en in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ l@@ y@@ n .
"We were going to mo@@ ve it into an off@@ ice , and we were going to actually sh@@ are space with a tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter ."
"So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these wr@@ it@@ ers and ed@@ it@@ ors and every@@ body — sort of a wr@@ iting comm@@ unity — coming into the off@@ ice every day any@@ way , why don &apos;t we just op@@ en up the fr@@ on@@ t of the buil@@ ding for stu@@ d@@ ents to come in there after school , get ex@@ tr@@ a help on their wr@@ it@@ ten h@@ om@@ e@@ work , so you have bas@@ ically no bor@@ der between these two comm@@ uni@@ ties ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on wh@@ at@@ ever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . the stu@@ d@@ ents f@@ low in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you tra@@ de , or you work a little bit l@@ ater or wh@@ at@@ ever it is ."
You give those h@@ our@@ s in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on to the stu@@ d@@ ents in the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood .
"So , we had this place , we r@@ en@@ ted it , the l@@ and@@ l@@ or@@ d was all for it . We did this m@@ ur@@ al , that &apos;s a Ch@@ r@@ is W@@ are m@@ ur@@ al , that bas@@ ically ex@@ pla@@ ins the enti@@ re hi@@ story of the pr@@ in@@ ted wor@@ d , in m@@ ur@@ al form — it ta@@ kes a long time to di@@ g@@ est and you have to st@@ and in the mi@@ dd@@ le of the ro@@ ad ."
So we r@@ en@@ ted this space .
"And everything was great ex@@ cep@@ t the l@@ and@@ l@@ or@@ d said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , the space is z@@ on@@ ed for re@@ ta@@ il ; you have to come up with something ."
You &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ t@@ a s@@ ell something .
"You can &apos;t just have a tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; H@@ a h@@ a ! Re@@ ally ! &quot; &quot; And we cou@@ ldn &apos;t think of any@@ thing nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly to s@@ ell , but we did all the nec@@ ess@@ ary re@@ sear@@ ch ."
"It used to be a we@@ i@@ ght room , so there were ru@@ bb@@ er f@@ lo@@ ors be@@ low , ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ c ti@@ le ce@@ il@@ ings and fl@@ u@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent li@@ gh@@ ts ."
"We took all that down , and we found be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful w@@ oo@@ d@@ en f@@ lo@@ ors , wh@@ it@@ ew@@ as@@ h@@ ed be@@ am@@ s and it had the look — wh@@ i@@ le we were r@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place , some@@ body said , &quot; You know , it really kind of loo@@ ks like the h@@ ul@@ l of a shi@@ p . &quot;"
"And we loo@@ ked around and some@@ body el@@ se said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , you should s@@ ell su@@ pp@@ li@@ es to the working b@@ uc@@ can@@ e@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made every@@ body l@@ au@@ gh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that ."
L@@ et &apos;s s@@ ell p@@ ir@@ ate su@@ pp@@ li@@ es . &quot; &quot; This is the p@@ ir@@ ate su@@ pp@@ ly st@@ ore .

H@@ ere you see plan@@ ks so@@ ld by the f@@ oo@@ t and we have su@@ pp@@ li@@ es to com@@ b@@ at sc@@ ur@@ v@@ y .

"U@@ p at the to@@ p , you see the e@@ ye@@ p@@ at@@ ch dis@@ pl@@ ay , which is the bl@@ ack col@@ um@@ n there for every@@ day use for your e@@ ye@@ p@@ at@@ ch , and then you have the pa@@ ste@@ l and other col@@ ors for ste@@ pp@@ ing out at ni@@ ght — sp@@ eci@@ al oc@@ ca@@ si@@ ons , b@@ ar m@@ it@@ z@@ va@@ h@@ s and wh@@ at@@ ever ."
So we op@@ en@@ ed this place . And this is a v@@ at that we f@@ ill with tre@@ as@@ u@@ res that stu@@ d@@ ents di@@ g in .

That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that d@@ ro@@ ps on people &apos;s he@@ a@@ ds .
"It be@@ came mo@@ p he@@ a@@ ds . And this is the f@@ ish the@@ ater , which is just a s@@ al@@ tw@@ ater t@@ ank with three se@@ at@@ s , and then right be@@ h@@ ind it we se@@ t up this space , which was the tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter ."
"So right there is the tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter , and then be@@ h@@ ind the cur@@ ta@@ in were the Mc@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s off@@ ic@@ es , where all of us would be working on the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine and book ed@@ iting and things like that ."
The ki@@ ds would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
"We se@@ t the place up , we op@@ en@@ ed up , we sp@@ ent mon@@ ths and mon@@ ths r@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place ."
"We had t@@ ab@@ l@@ es , c@@ ha@@ ir@@ s , compu@@ ters , everything ."
I went to a d@@ ot@@ -@@ co@@ m a@@ uc@@ tion at a H@@ o@@ li@@ day In@@ n in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to and I b@@ ou@@ ght 1@@ 1 G@@ 4@@ s with a st@@ ro@@ ke of a p@@ ad@@ d@@ le .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , we b@@ ou@@ ght &apos; e@@ m , we se@@ t everything up and then we wa@@ ited ."
"It was started with about 1@@ 2 of my fri@@ en@@ ds , people that I had kno@@ wn for years that were wr@@ it@@ ers in the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood ."
"And we s@@ at . And at 2 : 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . we put a s@@ and@@ w@@ ich bo@@ ard out on the fr@@ on@@ t si@@ de@@ wal@@ k and it just said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree T@@ ut@@ or@@ ing for Y@@ our En@@ g@@ li@@ sh@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated and W@@ r@@ it@@ ing@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated Ne@@ e@@ ds — J@@ ust C@@ ome I@@ n , It &apos;s A@@ ll F@@ ree . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , they &apos;re going to stor@@ m the g@@ ates , they &apos;re g@@ on@@ n@@ a love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t ."
"And so we wa@@ ited , we s@@ at at the t@@ ab@@ l@@ es , we wa@@ ited and wa@@ ited ."
"And every@@ body was be@@ coming very disc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged because it was we@@ e@@ ks and we@@ e@@ ks that we wa@@ ited , really , where no@@ body came in ."
"And then some@@ body al@@ er@@ ted us to the fact that maybe there was a tr@@ ust ga@@ p , because we were op@@ er@@ ating be@@ h@@ ind a p@@ ir@@ ate su@@ pp@@ ly st@@ ore . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?"
"And so then , around that time , I per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed a wom@@ an n@@ am@@ ed N@@ in@@ ev@@ e@@ h C@@ al@@ ig@@ ar@@ i , a l@@ on@@ g@@ time S@@ an Fr@@ an@@ ci@@ sc@@ o e@@ du@@ ca@@ t@@ or — she was te@@ ach@@ ing in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity , she had all the experi@@ ence nec@@ ess@@ ary , k@@ new everything about e@@ du@@ cation , was con@@ nec@@ ted with all the te@@ ach@@ ers and comm@@ unity memb@@ ers in the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood — I con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed her to mo@@ ve up from M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity where she was te@@ ach@@ ing ."
S@@ he took over as ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive di@@ rec@@ t@@ or .
"I@@ m@@ medi@@ at@@ ely , she made the in@@ ro@@ a@@ ds with the te@@ ach@@ ers and the par@@ ents and the stu@@ d@@ ents and everything , and so su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly it was actually ful@@ l every day ."
And what we were trying to off@@ er every day was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion .
The go@@ al was to have a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one ra@@ ti@@ o with every one of these stu@@ d@@ ents .
"You know , it &apos;s been pro@@ ven that 3@@ 5 to 4@@ 0 h@@ our@@ s a year with on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion , a stu@@ d@@ ent can get one gra@@ de le@@ vel high@@ er ."
"And so most of these stu@@ d@@ ents , En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h is not sp@@ ok@@ en in the home ."
"They come there , many times their par@@ ents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a ch@@ ur@@ ch pe@@ w that I b@@ ou@@ ght in a B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey a@@ uc@@ tion right there — the par@@ ents will some@@ times w@@ at@@ ch wh@@ i@@ le their ki@@ ds are being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"So that was the bas@@ is of it , was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion ."
And we found our@@ selves ful@@ l every day with ki@@ ds .
"If you &apos;re on V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a St@@ re@@ et with@@ in those few b@@ lo@@ c@@ ks at around 2 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , 2 : 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , you will get ru@@ n over , of@@ ten , by the ki@@ ds and their big bac@@ k@@ p@@ ac@@ ks , or wh@@ at@@ ever , actually r@@ un@@ ning to this space , which is very str@@ an@@ ge , because it &apos;s school , in a way ."
But there was something p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ cal happen@@ ing there that was just a little bit different .
"And the other thing was , there was no sti@@ gm@@ a ."
"K@@ i@@ ds w@@ er@@ en &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; C@@ en@@ ter@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ K@@ id@@ s-@@ Th@@ at@@ -@@ Ne@@ ed@@ -@@ Mo@@ re@@ -@@ H@@ el@@ p , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it was a p@@ ir@@ ate su@@ pp@@ ly st@@ ore , which is in@@ s@@ an@@ e ."
"And then secon@@ d@@ ly , there &apos;s a publi@@ sh@@ ing comp@@ any in the back ."
"And so our inter@@ ns were actually working at the same t@@ ab@@ l@@ es very of@@ ten , and sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , compu@@ ter@@ -@@ ne@@ x@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ compu@@ ter with the stu@@ d@@ ents ."
"And so it be@@ came a tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter — publi@@ sh@@ ing cen@@ ter , is what we called it — and a wr@@ iting cen@@ ter ."
"They go in , and they might be working with a hi@@ gh school stu@@ d@@ ent actually working on a no@@ vel — because we had very gi@@ f@@ ted ki@@ ds , too ."
So there &apos;s no sti@@ gm@@ a .
They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a cre@@ a@@ tive en@@ de@@ av@@ or .
They &apos;re see@@ ing ad@@ ul@@ ts . They &apos;re mo@@ d@@ el@@ ing their be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or .
"Th@@ ese ad@@ ul@@ ts , they &apos;re working in their fi@@ el@@ d ."
"They can le@@ an over , as@@ k a question of one of these ad@@ ul@@ ts and it all sort of fe@@ e@@ ds on each other ."
"There &apos;s a lot of cr@@ os@@ s-@@ p@@ oll@@ in@@ ation . The only problem , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally for the ad@@ ul@@ ts working at Mc@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s who ha@@ dn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly b@@ ou@@ ght into all of this when they si@@ gn@@ ed up , was that there was just the one ba@@ th@@ room . ( Laughter ) W@@ ith like 6@@ 0 ki@@ ds a day , this is a problem ."
"But you know , there &apos;s something about the ki@@ ds fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ing their h@@ om@@ e@@ work in a gi@@ ven day , working on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one , getting all this at@@ ten@@ tion — they go home , they &apos;re fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ed . They don &apos;t st@@ all ."
They don &apos;t do their h@@ om@@ e@@ work in fr@@ on@@ t of the T@@ V .
"They &apos;re al@@ low@@ ed to go home at 5 : 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , en@@ jo@@ y their fami@@ ly , en@@ jo@@ y other h@@ ob@@ bi@@ es , get out@@ side , pl@@ ay ."
And that ma@@ kes a happ@@ y fami@@ ly .
A b@@ un@@ ch of happ@@ y fami@@ li@@ es in a ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood is a happ@@ y comm@@ unity .
A b@@ un@@ ch of happ@@ y comm@@ uni@@ ties ti@@ ed together is a happ@@ y city and a happ@@ y world .
"So the k@@ ey to it all is h@@ om@@ e@@ work ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion ."
"So we started off with about 1@@ 2 v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , and then we had about 5@@ 0 , and then a cou@@ ple h@@ und@@ red ."
"And we now have 1,@@ 40@@ 0 v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers on our r@@ os@@ ter ."
And we make it incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly e@@ as@@ y to v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er .
"The k@@ ey thing is , even if you only have a cou@@ ple of h@@ our@@ s a mon@@ th , those two h@@ our@@ s sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , next to one stu@@ d@@ ent , con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated at@@ ten@@ tion , sh@@ in@@ ing this be@@ am of light on their work , on their thou@@ gh@@ ts and their sel@@ f-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , is going to be ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tely tran@@ s@@ forma@@ tive , because so many of the stu@@ d@@ ents have not had that ever before ."
"So we said , &quot; &quot; E@@ ven if you have two h@@ our@@ s one S@@ un@@ day every si@@ x mon@@ ths , it doesn &apos;t mat@@ ter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s par@@ tly why the tu@@ t@@ or cor@@ ps gre@@ w so f@@ ast ."
"Th@@ en we said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , what are we going to do with the space d@@ ur@@ ing the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . ? &quot; &quot; So we started br@@ ing@@ ing in cl@@ as@@ ses d@@ ur@@ ing the day ."
"So every day , there &apos;s a fi@@ el@@ d tri@@ p where they together create a book — you can see it being t@@ yp@@ ed up ab@@ o@@ ve ."
This is one of the cl@@ as@@ ses getting way too ex@@ c@@ ited about wr@@ iting .
"You just point a ca@@ m@@ er@@ a at a cl@@ as@@ s , and it always loo@@ ks like this ."
So this is one of the bo@@ o@@ ks that they do .
"N@@ o@@ ti@@ ce the ti@@ tle of the book , &quot; The B@@ oo@@ k That W@@ as N@@ ever Ch@@ ec@@ ked O@@ ut : T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot;"
"And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; On@@ ce there was a book n@@ am@@ ed C@@ in@@ dy that was about the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot; &quot; So , me@@ an@@ wh@@ i@@ le , there &apos;s an ad@@ ult in the back t@@ yp@@ ing this up , ta@@ king it comple@@ tely s@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly , which b@@ low@@ s their m@@ ind ."
So then we still had more tu@@ t@@ ors to use .
This is a sh@@ o@@ t of just some of the tu@@ t@@ ors d@@ ur@@ ing one of the ev@@ ents .
The te@@ ach@@ ers that we work with — and everything is different to te@@ ach@@ ers — they tell us what to do .
"We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , comple@@ tely m@@ al@@ le@@ able . You &apos;re going to tell us ."
"The ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood &apos;s going to tell us , the par@@ ents are going to tell us ."
"The te@@ ach@@ ers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most us@@ e@@ ful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ y don &apos;t you come into the sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s ?"
"@@ Because what about the stu@@ d@@ ents that w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t come to you , nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly , who don &apos;t have really ac@@ tive par@@ ents that are br@@ ing@@ ing them in , or ar@@ en &apos;t cl@@ ose enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started sa@@ ying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , we &apos;ve got 1,@@ 40@@ 0 people on our tu@@ t@@ or r@@ os@@ ter ."
"L@@ et &apos;s just put out the wor@@ d . &quot; &quot; A te@@ ac@@ her will say , &quot; &quot; I need 1@@ 2 tu@@ t@@ ors for the next fi@@ ve S@@ und@@ ays ."
"We &apos;re working on our col@@ le@@ ge es@@ sa@@ ys . S@@ end them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the w@@ ir@@ e : 1,@@ 40@@ 0 tu@@ t@@ ors ."
Wh@@ o@@ ever can make it si@@ gn@@ s up . They go in about a hal@@ f an h@@ our before the cl@@ as@@ s .
"The te@@ ac@@ her t@@ ells them what to do , how to do it , what their tra@@ in@@ ing is , what their proj@@ ect is so f@@ ar ."
"They work und@@ er the te@@ ac@@ her &apos;s gu@@ i@@ de , and it &apos;s all in one big room ."
"And that &apos;s actually the br@@ un@@ t of what we do is , people going st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght from their wor@@ k@@ place , st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght from home , st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght into the cl@@ as@@ s@@ room and working di@@ rec@@ tly with the stu@@ d@@ ents ."
So then we &apos;re able to work with thou@@ s@@ ands and thou@@ s@@ ands of more stu@@ d@@ ents .
"Th@@ en another school said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , what if we just give you a cl@@ as@@ s@@ room and you can st@@ af@@ f it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the E@@ ver@@ et@@ t Mi@@ dd@@ le S@@ ch@@ ool W@@ r@@ it@@ ers &apos; R@@ oo@@ m , where we d@@ ec@@ or@@ ated it in b@@ uc@@ can@@ e@@ er st@@ y@@ le ."
It &apos;s right off the li@@ br@@ ary . And there we ser@@ ve all 5@@ 2@@ 9 ki@@ ds in this mi@@ dd@@ le school .
"This is their ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er , the &quot; &quot; S@@ tra@@ i@@ gh@@ t-@@ U@@ p Ne@@ ws , &quot; &quot; that has an on@@ going col@@ um@@ n from M@@ ay@@ or G@@ av@@ in Ne@@ w@@ so@@ m in bot@@ h l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es — En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h and Sp@@ an@@ ish ."
"So then one day I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ l@@ en@@ de wr@@ ot@@ e to us and said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why don &apos;t you as@@ si@@ g@@ n a book with hi@@ gh school stu@@ d@@ ents ?"
"I want them to wr@@ ite about how to ac@@ hi@@ eve pe@@ ace in a vi@@ ol@@ ent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Th@@ ur@@ good M@@ ar@@ sh@@ all Hi@@ gh S@@ ch@@ ool , which is a school that we had wor@@ ked with on some other things , and we ga@@ ve that as@@ si@@ gn@@ ment to the stu@@ d@@ ents ."
"And we said , &quot; &quot; I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ l@@ en@@ de is going to re@@ ad all your es@@ sa@@ ys at the end ."
S@@ he &apos;s going to publi@@ s@@ h them in a book .
S@@ he &apos;s going to sp@@ on@@ s@@ or the pr@@ in@@ ting of this book in p@@ ap@@ er@@ back form .
"It &apos;s going to be a@@ va@@ il@@ able in all the bo@@ ok@@ st@@ o@@ res in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a and thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the world , on A@@ ma@@ z@@ on and you na@@ me it . &quot; &quot; So these ki@@ ds wor@@ ked h@@ ar@@ der than they &apos;ve ever wor@@ ked on any@@ thing in their li@@ ves , because there was that out@@ side au@@ di@@ ence , there was I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ l@@ en@@ de on the other end ."
I think we had about 17@@ 0 tu@@ t@@ ors that wor@@ ked on this book with them and so this wor@@ ked out incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly well .
We had a big par@@ ty at the end .
This is a book that you can find any@@ where . So that l@@ ed to a ser@@ ies of these .
"You can see A@@ my T@@ an sp@@ on@@ so@@ red the next one , &quot; I Mi@@ ght G@@ et S@@ om@@ e@@ where . &quot;"
And this be@@ came an on@@ going thing . M@@ ore and more bo@@ o@@ ks .
Now we &apos;re sort of ad@@ di@@ c@@ ted to the book thing .
"The ki@@ ds will work h@@ ar@@ der than they &apos;ve ever wor@@ ked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be per@@ man@@ ent , know it &apos;s going to be on a sh@@ el@@ f , know that no@@ body can di@@ min@@ ish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve h@@ on@@ o@@ red their wor@@ ds , h@@ on@@ o@@ red their thou@@ gh@@ ts with h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of h@@ our@@ s of fi@@ ve d@@ ra@@ f@@ ts , si@@ x d@@ ra@@ f@@ ts — all this at@@ ten@@ tion that we give to their thou@@ gh@@ ts ."
"And on@@ ce they ac@@ hi@@ eve that le@@ vel , on@@ ce they &apos;ve wr@@ it@@ ten at that le@@ vel , they can never go back ."
It &apos;s ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tely tran@@ s@@ forma@@ tive .
And so then they &apos;re all so@@ ld in the st@@ ore . This is ne@@ ar the plan@@ ks .
We s@@ ell all the stu@@ d@@ ent bo@@ o@@ ks .
"W@@ here el@@ se would you put them , right ?"
"So we s@@ ell &apos; e@@ m , and then something we@@ ir@@ d had been happen@@ ing with the st@@ o@@ res . The st@@ ore , actually — even th@@ ough we started out as just a ga@@ g — the st@@ ore actually made money ."
So it was p@@ ay@@ ing the r@@ ent .
"And maybe this is just a S@@ an Fr@@ an@@ ci@@ sc@@ o thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to ju@@ d@@ ge ."
But people would come in — and this was before the p@@ ir@@ ate mo@@ vi@@ es and everything !
"It was making a lot of money . No@@ t a lot of money , but it was p@@ ay@@ ing the r@@ ent , p@@ ay@@ ing a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time st@@ af@@ f memb@@ er there ."
There &apos;s the o@@ ce@@ an m@@ ap@@ s you can see on the left .
And it be@@ came a g@@ at@@ e@@ way to the comm@@ unity .
"P@@ e@@ ople would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?"
What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to s@@ we@@ ar on the we@@ b . ( Laughter ) I@@ s that a ru@@ le ? I don &apos;t know .
"They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and lear@@ n more about it ."
"And then right be@@ y@@ on@@ d — there &apos;s us@@ u@@ ally a little c@@ ha@@ in there — right be@@ y@@ on@@ d , they would see the ki@@ ds being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"This is a fi@@ el@@ d tri@@ p going on . And so they would be sh@@ opp@@ ing , and they might be more li@@ ke@@ ly to bu@@ y some l@@ ard , or mil@@ let for their par@@ ro@@ t , or , you know , a h@@ oo@@ k , or h@@ oo@@ k prot@@ ec@@ t@@ or for ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time , all of these things we s@@ ell ."
So the st@@ ore actually did really well .
"But it br@@ ou@@ ght in so many people — te@@ ach@@ ers , d@@ on@@ ors , v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , every@@ body — because it was st@@ re@@ et le@@ vel . It was op@@ en to the publi@@ c ."
"It w@@ as@@ n &apos;t a n@@ on@@ -@@ pro@@ f@@ it bu@@ ri@@ ed , you know , on the 30@@ th f@@ lo@@ or of some buil@@ ding do@@ wn@@ to@@ wn . It was right in the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood that it was ser@@ ving , and it was op@@ en all the time to the publi@@ c ."
"So , it be@@ came this sort of we@@ ir@@ d , happ@@ y ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent ."
"So all the people I used to know in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ l@@ y@@ n , they said , &quot; W@@ ell , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;"
"And a lot of them had been form@@ er e@@ du@@ ca@@ t@@ ors or w@@ ou@@ l@@ d-@@ be e@@ du@@ ca@@ t@@ ors , so they com@@ b@@ in@@ ed with a lot of lo@@ cal desig@@ n@@ ers , lo@@ cal wr@@ it@@ ers , and they just took the idea in@@ de@@ p@@ end@@ ently and they did their own thing ."
They didn &apos;t want to s@@ ell p@@ ir@@ ate su@@ pp@@ li@@ es .
They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
"So , kno@@ w@@ ing the cri@@ me@@ -@@ fi@@ gh@@ ting comm@@ unity in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k , they op@@ en@@ ed the B@@ ro@@ ok@@ l@@ y@@ n Su@@ per@@ h@@ er@@ o Su@@ pp@@ ly C@@ om@@ p@@ any ."
This is S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts &apos; great design that did this .
"And this was to make it look sort of like one of those ke@@ y@@ sm@@ ith &apos;s sh@@ op@@ s that has to have every ser@@ v@@ ice they &apos;ve ever off@@ er@@ ed , you know , all over there ."
"So they op@@ en@@ ed this place . In@@ side , it &apos;s like a C@@ os@@ t@@ c@@ o for su@@ per@@ h@@ er@@ o@@ es — all the su@@ pp@@ li@@ es in kind of bas@@ ic form ."
Th@@ ese are all h@@ and@@ made .
"Th@@ ese are all sort of re@@ p@@ ur@@ pos@@ ed other produc@@ ts , or wh@@ at@@ ever ."
A@@ ll the p@@ ac@@ k@@ ag@@ ing is done by S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts .
"So then you have the v@@ il@@ la@@ in con@@ ta@@ in@@ ment un@@ it , where ki@@ ds put their par@@ ents . You have the off@@ ice ."
"This is a little va@@ ult — you have to put your produc@@ t in there , it go@@ es up an elec@@ tri@@ c li@@ ft and then the gu@@ y be@@ h@@ ind the coun@@ ter t@@ ells you that you have to rec@@ ite the v@@ ow of h@@ er@@ o@@ is@@ m , which you do , if you want to bu@@ y any@@ thing . And it li@@ m@@ its , really , their s@@ al@@ es ."
"P@@ er@@ s@@ on@@ ally , I think it &apos;s a problem ."
Because they have to do it h@@ and on he@@ art and everything .
Th@@ ese are some of the produc@@ ts . Th@@ ese are all h@@ and@@ made .
This is a sec@@ re@@ t id@@ enti@@ ty k@@ it .
"If you want to take on the id@@ enti@@ ty of Sh@@ ar@@ on Bo@@ one , one Am@@ eri@@ can fe@@ m@@ ale mar@@ ke@@ ting ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive from H@@ o@@ bo@@ k@@ en , Ne@@ w J@@ er@@ se@@ y . It &apos;s a ful@@ l d@@ os@@ si@@ er on everything you would need to know about Sh@@ ar@@ on Bo@@ one ."
"So , this is the cap@@ er@@ y where you get f@@ it@@ ted for your cap@@ e , and then you wal@@ k up these three ste@@ el@@ -@@ gra@@ ded ste@@ ps and then we tur@@ n on three hy@@ d@@ ra@@ u@@ li@@ c f@@ ans from every side and then you can see the cap@@ e in ac@@ tion ."
"There &apos;s no@@ thing wor@@ se than , you know , getting up there and the cap@@ e is b@@ un@@ ch@@ ing up or something like that ."
"So then , the sec@@ re@@ t do@@ or — this is one of the sh@@ el@@ ves you don &apos;t see when you wal@@ k in , but it s@@ low@@ ly op@@ en@@ s ."
You can see it there in the mi@@ dd@@ le next to all the grap@@ pl@@ ing h@@ oo@@ ks .
It op@@ en@@ s and then this is the tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cen@@ ter in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the ful@@ l eff@@ ect !
"But this is — I just want to e@@ mp@@ ha@@ si@@ ze — lo@@ c@@ ally f@@ und@@ ed , lo@@ c@@ ally buil@@ t ."
"A@@ ll the desig@@ n@@ ers , all of the buil@@ d@@ ers , every@@ body was lo@@ cal , all the time was pro@@ -@@ b@@ on@@ o ."
"I just came and vi@@ s@@ ited and said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , you gu@@ ys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or wh@@ at@@ ever . That was it . You can see the time in all fi@@ ve bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s of Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space d@@ ur@@ ing tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing h@@ our@@ s ."
"It &apos;s very bus@@ y . Sa@@ me pr@@ in@@ ci@@ pl@@ es : on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion , comple@@ te de@@ vo@@ tion to the stu@@ d@@ ents &apos; work and a b@@ oun@@ d@@ less op@@ tim@@ is@@ m and sort of a pos@@ si@@ b@@ ility of cre@@ a@@ tiv@@ ity and ide@@ as ."
"And this sw@@ it@@ ch is f@@ li@@ c@@ ked in their he@@ a@@ ds when they wal@@ k through those 1@@ 8 fe@@ et of this bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re st@@ ore , right ?"
"So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school ."
"It &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly not school , even th@@ ough they &apos;re working sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der on t@@ ab@@ l@@ es , p@@ en@@ c@@ il@@ s and p@@ ap@@ ers , wh@@ at@@ ever ."
"This is one of the stu@@ d@@ ents , K@@ hal@@ ed H@@ am@@ d@@ an ."
You can re@@ ad this quot@@ e .
Ad@@ di@@ c@@ ted to vi@@ de@@ o g@@ am@@ es and T@@ V . C@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate at home .
Ca@@ me in . Go@@ t this con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated at@@ ten@@ tion .
And he cou@@ ldn &apos;t es@@ cap@@ e it .
"So , so@@ on enough , he was wr@@ iting . He would fin@@ ish his h@@ om@@ e@@ work ear@@ ly — got really ad@@ di@@ c@@ ted to fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ing his h@@ om@@ e@@ work ear@@ ly ."
"It &apos;s an ad@@ di@@ c@@ tive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it ch@@ ec@@ ked , and to know he &apos;s going to ac@@ hi@@ eve the next thing and be pre@@ par@@ ed for school the next day ."
"So he got h@@ oo@@ ked on that , and then he started doing other things ."
He &apos;s now been publi@@ sh@@ ed in fi@@ ve bo@@ o@@ ks .
"H@@ e co@@ -@@ wr@@ ot@@ e a mo@@ ck@@ um@@ ent@@ ary about fa@@ il@@ ed su@@ per@@ h@@ er@@ o@@ es called &quot; &quot; Su@@ per@@ -@@ H@@ as@@ -@@ Be@@ en@@ s . &quot; &quot; He wr@@ ot@@ e a ser@@ ies on &quot; &quot; P@@ en@@ gu@@ in B@@ al@@ bo@@ a , &quot; &quot; which is a fi@@ gh@@ ting — a bo@@ x@@ ing — p@@ en@@ gu@@ in ."

He &apos;s ev@@ an@@ ge@@ li@@ cal about it . He br@@ ings his cou@@ s@@ ins in now .
There &apos;s four fami@@ ly memb@@ ers that come in every day .

So you see everything : it &apos;s ex@@ ac@@ tly as a 7-@@ E@@ le@@ ven would be .
Le@@ ech@@ es . M@@ am@@ m@@ ot@@ h ch@@ un@@ ks . They even have their own Sl@@ ur@@ pe@@ e m@@ ach@@ ine : &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of Or@@ der . C@@ ome B@@ ack Y@@ est@@ er@@ day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) An@@ y@@ way . So I &apos;m going to j@@ um@@ p a@@ he@@ ad .
"Th@@ ese are sp@@ ac@@ es that are only a@@ ff@@ i@@ li@@ ated with us , doing this same thing : W@@ or@@ d St@@ . in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ fi@@ el@@ d , M@@ as@@ s@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts ; In@@ k S@@ po@@ t in C@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ nat@@ i ; Y@@ ou@@ th S@@ pe@@ a@@ ks , S@@ an Fr@@ an@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , which in@@ sp@@ i@@ red us ; S@@ tu@@ di@@ o St@@ .

Now I &apos;m going to the TE@@ D W@@ ish — is that ok@@ ay ?
"A@@ ll right , I &apos;ve got a min@@ ut@@ e .

P@@ ro@@ found le@@ ap@@ s for@@ w@@ ard !
And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re al@@ ready doing .
I know that so many people in this room are al@@ ready doing really interesting things .
"I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stor@@ ies and in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e o@@ th@@ ers on the we@@ bs@@ ite ."
We cre@@ ated a we@@ bs@@ ite .
"I &apos;m going to sw@@ it@@ ch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hop@@ e : We hop@@ e that the at@@ ten@@ de@@ es of this con@@ f@@ er@@ ence will us@@ her in a new er@@ a of par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation in our publi@@ c sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s ."

Al@@ ways let the te@@ ach@@ ers le@@ ad the way .
They will tell you how to be us@@ e@@ ful . I hop@@ e that you &apos;ll ste@@ p in and help out .
There are a million ways .
You can wal@@ k up to your lo@@ cal school and con@@ s@@ ult with the te@@ ach@@ ers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
"So , this is with H@@ o@@ t S@@ tu@@ di@@ o in S@@ an Fr@@ an@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , they did this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al jo@@ b ."
"This we@@ bs@@ ite is al@@ ready up , it &apos;s al@@ ready got a b@@ un@@ ch of stor@@ ies , a lot of ide@@ as . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; On@@ ce U@@ p@@ on a S@@ ch@@ ool , &quot; &quot; which is a great ti@@ tle , I think ."
"This s@@ ite will do@@ c@@ um@@ ent every story , every proj@@ ect that comes out of this con@@ f@@ er@@ ence and around the world .

And he &apos;ll get you in@@ sp@@ i@@ red and get you going and gu@@ i@@ de you through the pro@@ cess so that you can a@@ ff@@ ect change .
And it can be fu@@ n ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it nee@@ dn &apos;t be st@@ eri@@ le . It nee@@ dn &apos;t be bu@@ re@@ a@@ uc@@ ra@@ tic@@ ally un@@ ten@@ able .
You can do and use the sk@@ ill@@ s that you have .
The sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s need you . The te@@ ach@@ ers need you .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents and par@@ ents need you .

S@@ ome of these ki@@ ds just don &apos;t pla@@ in know how good they are : how sm@@ art and how much they have to say .
"You can tell them . You can sh@@ ine that light on them , one human inter@@ ac@@ tion at a time . So we hop@@ e you &apos;ll jo@@ in us ."
Thank you so much .
( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
And I say &quot; &quot; th@@ ank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was s@@ il@@ ent for 1@@ 7 years .
"And the first wor@@ ds that I sp@@ o@@ ke were in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on , D.@@ C@@ . , on the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ary of E@@ ar@@ th D@@ ay ."
And my fami@@ ly and fri@@ en@@ ds had ga@@ ther@@ ed there to he@@ ar me spe@@ a@@ k .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; M@@ y mo@@ ther , out in the au@@ di@@ ence , she ju@@ mp@@ ed up , &quot; H@@ all@@ el@@ u@@ ja@@ h , Jo@@ h@@ n@@ n@@ y ’ s tal@@ king ! &quot;"
"( Laughter ) I@@ ma@@ gine if you were qu@@ i@@ et for 1@@ 7 years and your mo@@ ther was out in the au@@ di@@ ence , say ."
"M@@ y d@@ ad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll ex@@ pla@@ in that ."
But I tur@@ ned around because I didn ’ t re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e where my vo@@ ice was coming from .
"I ha@@ dn ’ t he@@ ard my vo@@ ice in 1@@ 7 years , so I tur@@ ned around and I loo@@ ked and I said , &quot; G@@ od , who &apos;s sa@@ ying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;"
"And then I re@@ aliz@@ ed it was me , you know , and I kind of l@@ augh@@ ed ."
"And I could see my fa@@ ther : &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h , he really is c@@ ra@@ z@@ y . &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , I want to take you on this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y ."
"And the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , I believe , is a me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or for all of our j@@ our@@ ne@@ ys ."
"E@@ ven th@@ ough this one is kind of un@@ us@@ u@@ al , I want you to think about your own j@@ our@@ ne@@ y ."
"M@@ y j@@ our@@ ne@@ y be@@ g@@ an in 19@@ 7@@ 1 when I w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed two o@@ il t@@ an@@ k@@ ers col@@ li@@ de b@@ en@@ e@@ ath the G@@ ol@@ d@@ en G@@ ate , and a hal@@ f a million g@@ all@@ ons of o@@ il sp@@ ill@@ ed into the b@@ ay ."
It di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ed me so much that I deci@@ ded that I was going to give up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in m@@ ot@@ or@@ iz@@ ed ve@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es .
That ’ s a big thing in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
"And it was a big thing in my little comm@@ unity of Po@@ int R@@ ey@@ es S@@ ta@@ tion in In@@ ver@@ n@@ ess , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , because there were only about 35@@ 0 people there in the w@@ in@@ ter – this was back in &apos; 7@@ 1 now ."
"And so when I came in and I started wal@@ king around , people — they just k@@ new what was going on ."
"And people would dri@@ ve up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; Jo@@ h@@ n , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , I ’ m wal@@ king for the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; N@@ o , you ’ re wal@@ king to make us look b@@ ad , right ?"
"You ’ re wal@@ king to make us feel b@@ ad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some tr@@ u@@ th to that , because I thought that if I started wal@@ king , every@@ one would f@@ ol@@ low ."
"@@ Because of the o@@ il , every@@ body tal@@ ked about the p@@ oll@@ l@@ ution ."
"And so I ar@@ gu@@ ed with people about that , I ar@@ gu@@ ed and I ar@@ gu@@ ed ."
I called my par@@ ents up .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve gi@@ ven up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in c@@ ars . &quot; &quot; M@@ y d@@ ad said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ y didn ’ t you do that when you were 1@@ 6 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment then ."
They ’ re back in Ph@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ p@@ hi@@ a .
"And so I to@@ ld my mo@@ ther , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happ@@ y th@@ ough , I ’ m really happ@@ y . &quot; &quot; S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; I@@ f you were happ@@ y , son , you w@@ ou@@ ldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ th@@ ers are like that ."
"And so , on my 2@@ 7@@ th b@@ ir@@ th@@ day I deci@@ ded , because I ar@@ gu@@ ed so much and I talk so much , that I was going to st@@ op spe@@ a@@ king for just one day — one day — to give it a re@@ st ."
And so I did .
I got up in the mor@@ ning and I didn ’ t say a wor@@ d .
"And I have to tell you , it was a very mo@@ ving experi@@ ence , because for the first time , I be@@ g@@ an li@@ st@@ en@@ ing — in a long time ."
"And what I he@@ ard , it kind of di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ed me ."
"@@ Because what I used to do , when I thought I was li@@ st@@ en@@ ing , was I would li@@ st@@ en just enough to he@@ ar what people had to say and think that I could — I k@@ new what they were going to say , and so I st@@ opp@@ ed li@@ st@@ en@@ ing ."
"And in my m@@ ind , I just kind of r@@ ac@@ ed a@@ he@@ ad and thought of what I was going to say back , wh@@ i@@ le they were still fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ing up ."
And then I would la@@ un@@ ch in .
"Well , that just en@@ ded comm@@ uni@@ cation ."
So on this first day I actually li@@ st@@ en@@ ed .
"And it was very sa@@ d for me , because I re@@ aliz@@ ed that for those many years I had not been lear@@ ning ."
I was 2@@ 7 . I thought I k@@ new everything .
I didn ’ t .
"And so I deci@@ ded I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day un@@ ti@@ l fin@@ ally , I pr@@ om@@ is@@ ed my@@ self for a year I would ke@@ ep qu@@ i@@ et because I started lear@@ ning more and more and I nee@@ ded to lear@@ n more ."
"So for a year I said I would ke@@ ep qu@@ i@@ et , and then on my b@@ ir@@ th@@ day I would reas@@ s@@ ess what I had lear@@ ned and maybe I would talk again ."
"Well , that la@@ st@@ ed 1@@ 7 years ."
"Now d@@ ur@@ ing that time — those 1@@ 7 years — I wal@@ ked and I pl@@ ay@@ ed the b@@ an@@ j@@ o and I pa@@ in@@ ted and I wr@@ ot@@ e in my j@@ our@@ n@@ al , and I tri@@ ed to stu@@ dy the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment by read@@ ing bo@@ o@@ ks ."
And I deci@@ ded that I was going to go to school . So I did .
"I wal@@ ked up to A@@ sh@@ l@@ and , O@@ re@@ g@@ on , where they were off@@ er@@ ing an en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ent@@ al stu@@ di@@ es de@@ gre@@ e ."
It ’ s only 50@@ 0 mil@@ es .
"And I went into the Re@@ gi@@ st@@ ra@@ r ’ s off@@ ice and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;"
I had a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er cli@@ pp@@ ing .
"@@ &quot; &quot; O@@ h , so you really want to go to school here ?"
You don ’ t … ?
We have a sp@@ eci@@ al pro@@ gra@@ m for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
"And in those two years , I gra@@ du@@ ated with my first de@@ gre@@ e — a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ."
"And my fa@@ ther came out , he was so pr@@ ou@@ d ."
"H@@ e said , &quot; &quot; Li@@ st@@ en , we ’ re really pr@@ ou@@ d of you son , but what are you going to do with a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ?"
"You don ’ t ri@@ de in c@@ ars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I h@@ un@@ ch@@ ed my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , I pic@@ ked my bac@@ k@@ p@@ ack up again and I started wal@@ king ."
"I wal@@ ked all the way up to P@@ ort T@@ ow@@ n@@ s@@ end , W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on , where I buil@@ t a w@@ oo@@ d@@ en bo@@ at , ro@@ de it ac@@ r@@ oss Pu@@ get S@@ ound and wal@@ ked ac@@ r@@ oss W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on &#9@@ 1@@ ; to &#9@@ 3@@ ; I@@ da@@ h@@ o and down to M@@ is@@ s@@ ou@@ l@@ a , M@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ a ."
I had wr@@ it@@ ten the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of M@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ a two years ear@@ li@@ er and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
( Laughter ) And I was there . I show@@ ed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really hel@@ p@@ ed me .
There are two stor@@ ies in M@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ a .
The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a si@@ g@@ n I used a lot .
"And they said , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that . &quot; &quot; The di@@ rec@@ t@@ or of the pro@@ gra@@ m said , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome back t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w . &quot; &quot; He ga@@ ve me 15@@ 0 doll@@ ars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Re@@ gi@@ ster for one cre@@ d@@ it ."
"You ’ re going to go to S@@ ou@@ th Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a , ar@@ en ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Ri@@ ver@@ s and la@@ kes , the hy@@ d@@ ro@@ logi@@ cal sy@@ st@@ ems , S@@ ou@@ th Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a ."
So I did that .
"H@@ e came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; O@@ K Jo@@ h@@ n , now that you &apos;ve re@@ gi@@ st@@ er@@ ed for that one cre@@ d@@ it , you can have a k@@ ey to an off@@ ice , you can mat@@ ri@@ cul@@ ate — you ’ re mat@@ ri@@ cul@@ ating , so you can use the li@@ br@@ ary ."
"And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the pro@@ f@@ ess@@ ors al@@ low you to go to cl@@ as@@ s ."
"They ’ re going to sa@@ ve your gra@@ de , and when we fi@@ g@@ ure out how to get you the re@@ st of the money , then you can re@@ gi@@ ster for that cl@@ as@@ s and they ’ ll give you the gra@@ de . &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , they don ’ t do that in gra@@ du@@ ate sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s , I don ’ t think ."
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
"They sa@@ w that I was really interest@@ ed in the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment , and they really wanted to help me al@@ ong the way ."
"And d@@ ur@@ ing that time , I actually ta@@ u@@ ght cl@@ as@@ ses with@@ out spe@@ a@@ king ."
I had 1@@ 3 stu@@ d@@ ents when I first wal@@ ked into the cl@@ as@@ s .
"I ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed , with a fri@@ end who could inter@@ pre@@ t my si@@ g@@ n l@@ an@@ gu@@ age , that I was Jo@@ h@@ n Fr@@ an@@ c@@ is , I was wal@@ king around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here inter@@ pre@@ ting for me ."
A@@ ll the stu@@ d@@ ents s@@ at around and they went ..@@ .
"( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the sch@@ e@@ du@@ le , to see when they could get out ."
They had to take that cl@@ as@@ s with me .
"T@@ w@@ o we@@ e@@ ks l@@ ater , every@@ one was trying to get into our cl@@ as@@ s ."
And I lear@@ ned in that cl@@ as@@ s — because I would do things like this ..@@ .
"@@ and they were all ga@@ ther@@ ed around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s tal@@ king about c@@ le@@ ar c@@ ut@@ ting . &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h , c@@ le@@ ar c@@ ut@@ ting . &quot;"
"@@ &quot; N@@ o , no , no , that &apos;s not c@@ le@@ ar c@@ ut@@ ting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a h@@ and@@ sa@@ w . &quot;"
"@@ &quot; W@@ ell , you can ’ t c@@ lear@@ c@@ ut with a ..@@ . &quot;"
"@@ &quot; Y@@ es , you can c@@ le@@ ar c@@ ut ..@@ . &quot;"
"@@ &quot; N@@ o , I think he ’ s tal@@ king about sel@@ ec@@ tive fo@@ re@@ str@@ y . &quot;"
Now this was a disc@@ us@@ sion cl@@ as@@ s and we were ha@@ ving a disc@@ us@@ sion .
"I just bac@@ ked out of that , you know , and I just kind of ke@@ p@@ t the fi@@ sts from fl@@ ying ."
"But what I lear@@ ned was that some@@ times I would make a si@@ g@@ n and they said things that I ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tely did not mean , but I should have ."
"And so what came to me is , if you were a te@@ ac@@ her and you were te@@ ach@@ ing , if you w@@ er@@ en ’ t lear@@ ning you prob@@ ably w@@ er@@ en ’ t te@@ ach@@ ing very well ."
And so I went on .
"M@@ y d@@ ad came out to see me gra@@ du@@ ate and , you know , I did the de@@ al , and my fa@@ ther said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really pr@@ ou@@ d of you son , but ..@@ . &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving and start tal@@ king ."
"Wh@@ at are you going to do with a ma@@ ster ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ? &quot; &quot; I h@@ un@@ ch@@ ed my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , I got my bac@@ k@@ p@@ ack and I went on to the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of W@@ is@@ con@@ s@@ in ."
I sp@@ ent two years there wr@@ iting on o@@ il sp@@ ill@@ s .
N@@ o one was interest@@ ed in o@@ il sp@@ ill@@ s .
But something happened — Ex@@ x@@ on V@@ al@@ de@@ z .
And I was the only one in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates wr@@ iting on o@@ il sp@@ ill@@ s .
M@@ y d@@ ad came out again .
"H@@ e said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ri@@ de in c@@ ars , you don ’ t talk ."
"M@@ y si@@ ster said maybe I should lea@@ ve you al@@ one , because you see@@ m to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not sa@@ ying any@@ thing . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) W@@ ell , I put on my bac@@ k@@ p@@ ack again ."
"I put my b@@ an@@ j@@ o on and I wal@@ ked all the way to the E@@ ast Co@@ ast , put my f@@ oo@@ t in the A@@ tl@@ an@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an — it was se@@ ven years and one day it took me to wal@@ k ac@@ r@@ oss the Un@@ ited St@@ ates ."
"And on E@@ ar@@ th D@@ ay , 19@@ 9@@ 0 — the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ary of E@@ ar@@ th D@@ ay — that ’ s when I be@@ g@@ an to spe@@ a@@ k ."
"And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that t@@ ree in the fo@@ re@@ st f@@ all@@ ing ; and if there &apos;s no one there to he@@ ar , does it really make a s@@ ound ?"
"And I ’ m th@@ an@@ king you , and I &apos;m th@@ an@@ king my fami@@ ly because they had come to he@@ ar me spe@@ a@@ k ."
And that ’ s comm@@ uni@@ cation .
And they also ta@@ u@@ ght me about li@@ st@@ en@@ ing — that they li@@ st@@ en@@ ed to me .
"And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the s@@ il@@ ence , the li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to each other ."
"@@ Re@@ ally , very important — we need to li@@ st@@ en to each other ."
"Well , my j@@ our@@ ne@@ y ke@@ p@@ t going on ."
"M@@ y d@@ ad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go ."
"I wor@@ ked for the Co@@ a@@ st@@ gu@@ ard , was made a U.@@ N@@ . G@@ oo@@ d@@ will A@@ mb@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"I wr@@ ot@@ e re@@ g@@ ul@@ ations for the Un@@ ited St@@ ates — I mean , I wr@@ ot@@ e o@@ il sp@@ ill re@@ g@@ ul@@ ations ."
"@@ 2@@ 0 years ago , if some@@ one had said to me , &quot; Jo@@ h@@ n , do you really want to make a differ@@ ence ? &quot;"
"@@ &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h , I want to make a differ@@ ence . &quot;"
"H@@ e said , &quot; &quot; You just start wal@@ king e@@ ast ; get out of your ca@@ r and just start wal@@ king e@@ ast . &quot; &quot; And as I wal@@ ked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h , and sh@@ ut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a differ@@ ence , bu@@ d@@ dy . &quot;"
"H@@ ow could that be , how could that be ?"
How could doing s@@ uch a si@@ mple thing like wal@@ king and not tal@@ king make a differ@@ ence ?
"Well , my time at the Co@@ ast Gu@@ ard was a really good time ."
"And after that — I only wor@@ ked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . On@@ e year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at and I sa@@ il@@ ed down to the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , and wal@@ ked through all of the is@@ l@@ ands , and to V@@ en@@ e@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ a ."
"And you know , I for@@ got the most important thing , which is why I started tal@@ king , which I have to tell you ."
I started tal@@ king because I had stu@@ di@@ ed en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
"I ’ d stu@@ di@@ ed en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment at this forma@@ l le@@ vel , but there was this in@@ forma@@ l le@@ vel ."
"And the in@@ forma@@ l le@@ vel — I lear@@ ned about people , and what we do and how we are ."
And en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment chan@@ ged from just being about tre@@ es and b@@ ir@@ ds and end@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ed spec@@ ies to being about how we tre@@ ated each other .
"@@ Because if we are the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we tre@@ at our@@ selves and how we tre@@ at each other ."
And so that ’ s the m@@ ess@@ age that I had .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , I &apos;m going to have to sp@@ re@@ ad that m@@ ess@@ age . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at , sa@@ il@@ ed all the way through the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an — it w@@ as@@ n &apos;t really my sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at , I kind of wor@@ ked on that bo@@ at — got to V@@ en@@ e@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ a and I started wal@@ king ."
"This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ri@@ de in m@@ ot@@ or@@ iz@@ ed ve@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es ."
"I was wal@@ king through E@@ l D@@ or@@ a@@ do — it &apos;s a pri@@ son to@@ wn , fam@@ ous pri@@ son , or in@@ fam@@ ous pri@@ son — in V@@ en@@ e@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ a , and I don ’ t know what pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed me , because this was not like me ."
"There I am , wal@@ king p@@ ast the gu@@ ard g@@ ate and the gu@@ ard st@@ op@@ s and sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ ap@@ ort@@ e , p@@ as@@ ap@@ ort@@ e , &quot; &quot; and with an M@@ 1@@ 6 po@@ in@@ ted at me ."
"And I loo@@ ked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ sp@@ ort , hu@@ h ?"
I don &apos;t need to show you my p@@ as@@ sp@@ ort . It ’ s in the back of my p@@ ack .
I &apos;m Dr@@ . Fr@@ an@@ c@@ is ; I &apos;m a U.@@ N@@ . A@@ mb@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ or and I &apos;m wal@@ king around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started wal@@ king off .
What pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed me to say this thing ?
The ro@@ ad tur@@ ned into the j@@ un@@ g@@ le .
I didn ’ t get sh@@ o@@ t .
"And I got to — I start sa@@ ying , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree at last — th@@ ank G@@ od Al@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty , I ’ m f@@ ree at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m sa@@ ying . What was that about ?"
"It took me 10@@ 0 mil@@ es to fi@@ g@@ ure out that , in my he@@ art , in me , I had become a pri@@ s@@ on@@ er ."
I was a pri@@ s@@ on@@ er and I nee@@ ded to es@@ cap@@ e .
The pri@@ son that I was in was the fact that I did not dri@@ ve or use m@@ ot@@ or@@ iz@@ ed ve@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es .
Now how could that be ?
"@@ Because when I started , it se@@ em@@ ed very ap@@ pro@@ pri@@ ate to me not to use m@@ ot@@ or@@ iz@@ ed ve@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es ."
"But the thing that was different was that every b@@ ir@@ th@@ day , I as@@ ked my@@ self about s@@ il@@ ence , but I never as@@ ked my@@ self about my deci@@ sion to just use my fe@@ et ."

I had no idea I would have a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ .
"And so I re@@ aliz@@ ed that I had a resp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ ility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change ."
"You know , we can do it ."
I was going to have to change .
"And I was af@@ ra@@ id to change , because I was so used to the gu@@ y who only just wal@@ ked ."
I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to st@@ op .
I didn ’ t know who I would be if I chan@@ ged .
But I know I nee@@ ded to .
"I know I nee@@ ded to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today ."
"And I know that a lot of times we find our@@ selves in this w@@ on@@ der@@ ful place where we ’ ve g@@ ot@@ ten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go ."
"And we kind of have to lea@@ ve be@@ h@@ ind the sec@@ ur@@ ity of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are be@@ coming ."
"And so , I want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you to go to that next place , to let y@@ our@@ self out of any pri@@ son that you might find y@@ our@@ self in , as com@@ for@@ t@@ able as it may be , because we have to do something now ."
We have to change now .
"A@@ s our form@@ er V@@ ice P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ent said , we have to become ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts ."

"So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the l@@ at@@ est ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of In@@ di@@ a &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — l@@ on@@ g@@ est r@@ un@@ ning so@@ a@@ p op@@ er@@ a , which is cri@@ ck@@ et ."

"And like all good so@@ ap@@ s , it ju@@ mp@@ s 2@@ 0 years when the au@@ di@@ ence inter@@ est chan@@ ges ."
And that &apos;s ex@@ ac@@ tly what cri@@ ck@@ et has done .
It &apos;s ju@@ mp@@ ed 2@@ 0 years into 20@@ -@@ over ga@@ me .
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change lea@@ ds to a very big re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution ."
But it w@@ as@@ n &apos;t always like that .
C@@ ri@@ ck@@ et w@@ as@@ n &apos;t always this spe@@ ed@@ -@@ dri@@ ven gener@@ ations ga@@ me .
"There was a time when you pl@@ ay@@ ed cri@@ ck@@ et , you pl@@ ay@@ ed tim@@ el@@ ess t@@ est mat@@ ch@@ es , when you pl@@ ay@@ ed on ti@@ ll the ga@@ me got over ."
And there was this ga@@ me in M@@ ar@@ ch 19@@ 3@@ 9 that started on the th@@ ir@@ d of M@@ ar@@ ch and en@@ ded on the 14@@ th of M@@ ar@@ ch .
"And it only en@@ ded because the En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h cri@@ c@@ ke@@ ters had to go from D@@ ur@@ b@@ an to C@@ ap@@ e T@@ own , which is a tw@@ o-@@ h@@ our tra@@ in j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , to ca@@ t@@ ch the shi@@ p that left on the 17@@ th , because the next shi@@ p w@@ as@@ n &apos;t around for a long time ."
"So , the mat@@ ch was en@@ ded in between ."
"And one of the En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h b@@ at@@ sm@@ en said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
A@@ no@@ ther hal@@ f an h@@ our and we would have w@@ on . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A@@ no@@ ther hal@@ f an h@@ our after 1@@ 2 d@@ ays .
"There were two S@@ und@@ ays in between . But of course , S@@ und@@ ays are ch@@ ur@@ ch d@@ ays , so you don &apos;t pl@@ ay on S@@ und@@ ays . And one day it ra@@ in@@ ed , so they all s@@ at around making fri@@ en@@ ds with each other ."
But there is a reas@@ on why In@@ di@@ a f@@ ell in love with cri@@ ck@@ et : because we had about the same p@@ ace of life .
"( Laughter ) The Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ h@@ ar@@ at@@ a was like that as well , w@@ as@@ n &apos;t it ?"
"You f@@ ou@@ ght by day , then it was s@@ un@@ se@@ t , so every@@ one went back home ."
"And then you wor@@ ked out your str@@ at@@ e@@ gy , and you came and f@@ ou@@ ght the next day , and you went back home again ."
"The only differ@@ ence between the Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ h@@ ar@@ at@@ a and our cri@@ ck@@ et was that in cri@@ ck@@ et , every@@ body was ali@@ ve to come back and fi@@ ght the next day ."
"P@@ r@@ in@@ ces p@@ at@@ r@@ on@@ iz@@ e the ga@@ me , not because they love the ga@@ me , but because it was a means of ing@@ ra@@ ti@@ ating the@@ m@@ selves to the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ s@@ h r@@ ul@@ ers ."
"But there is one other reas@@ on why In@@ di@@ a f@@ ell in love with cri@@ ck@@ et , which was , all you nee@@ ded was a pl@@ ank of w@@ ood and a ru@@ bb@@ er b@@ all , and any number of people could pl@@ ay it any@@ where ."
"T@@ a@@ ke a look : You could pl@@ ay it in the d@@ um@@ p with some ro@@ c@@ ks over there , you could pl@@ ay it in a little al@@ le@@ y — you cou@@ ldn &apos;t h@@ it s@@ qu@@ are any@@ where , because the b@@ at h@@ it the w@@ all ; don &apos;t for@@ get the a@@ ir con@@ di@@ tion@@ ing and the ca@@ ble wi@@ res ."
( Laughter ) You could pl@@ ay it on the b@@ an@@ ks of the G@@ an@@ ges — that &apos;s as c@@ le@@ an as the G@@ an@@ ges has been for a long time .
"O@@ r you could pl@@ ay many g@@ am@@ es in one small p@@ at@@ ch of l@@ and , even if you didn &apos;t know which ga@@ me you were actually in ."
"( Laughter ) A@@ s you can see , you can pl@@ ay any@@ where ."
"But s@@ low@@ ly the ga@@ me mo@@ ved on , you know , fin@@ ally ."
"You don &apos;t always have fi@@ ve d@@ ays . So , we mo@@ ved on , and we started pl@@ ay@@ ing 50@@ -@@ over cri@@ ck@@ et ."
And then an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent took place .
"In In@@ di@@ an sp@@ ort we don &apos;t make things happ@@ en , ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents happ@@ en and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , some@@ times ."
And we w@@ on this W@@ or@@ ld C@@ up in 19@@ 8@@ 3 .
"And su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly we f@@ ell in love with the 50@@ -@@ over ga@@ me , and we pl@@ ay@@ ed it vir@@ tually every day ."
There was more 50@@ -@@ over cri@@ ck@@ et than any@@ where .
But there was another big d@@ ate .
19@@ 8@@ 3 was when we w@@ on the W@@ or@@ ld C@@ up .
"@@ 19@@ 9@@ 1 , &apos; 9@@ 2 , we found a fin@@ ance min@@ i@@ ster and a pri@@ me min@@ i@@ ster w@@ ill@@ ing to let the world look at In@@ di@@ a , ra@@ ther than be this great country of in@@ tri@@ gu@@ e and my@@ st@@ er@@ y in this cl@@ os@@ ed country ."
And so we al@@ low@@ ed m@@ ul@@ t@@ in@@ a@@ tion@@ als into In@@ di@@ a .
"We c@@ ut cu@@ st@@ om@@ s du@@ ties , we re@@ duc@@ ed imp@@ ort du@@ ties , and we got all the m@@ ul@@ t@@ in@@ a@@ tion@@ als coming in , with m@@ ul@@ t@@ in@@ a@@ tional bu@@ d@@ ge@@ ts , who loo@@ ked at per@@ -@@ cap@@ it@@ a in@@ come and got very ex@@ c@@ ited about the pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties in In@@ di@@ a , and were looking for a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le to re@@ ach every In@@ di@@ an ."
"And there are only two ve@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es in In@@ di@@ a — one real , one sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ted ."
"The sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ted one is what you see in the mo@@ vi@@ es , the real one was cri@@ ck@@ et ."
"And so one of my fri@@ en@@ ds s@@ it@@ ting right here in fr@@ on@@ t of me , R@@ av@@ i Dh@@ ari@@ w@@ al from P@@ ep@@ s@@ i , deci@@ ded he &apos;s going to take it all over the world ."
"And P@@ ep@@ s@@ i was this big re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution , because they started ta@@ king cri@@ ck@@ et all over ."
And so cri@@ ck@@ et started be@@ coming big ; cri@@ ck@@ et started br@@ ing@@ ing ri@@ ch@@ es in .
"T@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion started co@@ ver@@ ing cri@@ ck@@ et . F@@ or a long time t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion said , &quot; &quot; We w@@ on &apos;t co@@ ver cri@@ ck@@ et un@@ less you p@@ ay us to co@@ ver it . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en they said , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , the next ri@@ gh@@ ts are so@@ ld for 5@@ 5 million doll@@ ars ."
"The next ri@@ gh@@ ts are so@@ ld for 6@@ 1@@ 2 million doll@@ ars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a cur@@ ve , that ."
And then another big ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent happened in our cri@@ ck@@ et .
"E@@ n@@ gl@@ and inv@@ en@@ ted 2@@ 0 over@@ s cri@@ ck@@ et , and said , &quot; &quot; The world m@@ ust pl@@ ay 2@@ 0 over@@ s cri@@ ck@@ et . &quot; &quot; J@@ ust as En@@ gl@@ and inv@@ en@@ ted cri@@ ck@@ et , and made the re@@ st of the world pl@@ ay it ."
Thank G@@ od for them .
"( Laughter ) And so , In@@ di@@ a had to go and pl@@ ay the T@@ 2@@ 0 W@@ or@@ ld C@@ up , you see ."
In@@ di@@ a didn &apos;t want to pl@@ ay the T@@ 2@@ 0 W@@ or@@ ld C@@ up .
But we were for@@ c@@ ed to pl@@ ay it by an 8@@ -@@ 1 mar@@ g@@ in .
And then something very d@@ ra@@ ma@@ tic happened .
"We got to the fin@@ al , and then this mom@@ ent , that will re@@ ma@@ in en@@ sh@@ r@@ in@@ ed fo@@ re@@ ver , for every@@ body , take a look ."
( C@@ ro@@ w@@ d ch@@ e@@ er@@ ing ) The Pa@@ ki@@ st@@ an@@ i b@@ at@@ s@@ man trying to c@@ le@@ ar the fi@@ el@@ der .

"@@ A ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve , ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve s@@ uc@@ cess : In@@ di@@ a , the world T@@ T c@@ ha@@ mp@@ i@@ ons ."
H@@ ar@@ sh@@ a B@@ ho@@ g@@ le : Su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly In@@ di@@ a disc@@ over@@ ed this power of 20@@ -@@ over@@ s cri@@ ck@@ et .
"The ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent , of course , there , was that the b@@ at@@ s@@ man thought the bo@@ wl@@ er was bo@@ wl@@ ing f@@ ast ."
"( Laughter ) I@@ f he had bo@@ wl@@ ed f@@ ast , the b@@ all would have g@@ one where it was me@@ ant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly disc@@ over@@ ed that we could be good at this ga@@ me ."
And what it also did was it l@@ ed to a cer@@ ta@@ in pri@@ de in the fact that In@@ di@@ a could be the best in the world .
"It was at a time when in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment was coming in , In@@ di@@ a was fe@@ el@@ ing a little more con@@ fi@@ d@@ ent about it@@ self ."
And so there was a fe@@ el@@ ing that there was great pri@@ de in what we can do .
"And th@@ an@@ k@@ ful@@ ly for all of us , the En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h are very good at inv@@ en@@ ting things , and then the gr@@ ac@@ i@@ ous people that they are , they let the world become very good at it ."
"( Laughter ) And so En@@ gl@@ and inv@@ en@@ ted T@@ 2@@ 0 cri@@ ck@@ et , and al@@ low@@ ed In@@ di@@ a to hi@@ j@@ ack it ."
"It was not like re@@ en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing that we do in medi@@ c@@ ine , we just took it st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght away , as is ."
"( Laughter ) And so , we la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed our own T@@ 2@@ 0 le@@ ag@@ ue ."
"S@@ i@@ x we@@ e@@ ks , city ver@@ su@@ s city ."
"It was a new thing for us . We had only ever su@@ pp@@ or@@ ted our country — the only two are@@ as in which In@@ di@@ a was very pr@@ ou@@ d about their country , re@@ pres@@ en@@ ting it@@ self on the fi@@ el@@ d ."
"O@@ n@@ e was w@@ ar , the In@@ di@@ an ar@@ my , which we don &apos;t like to happ@@ en very of@@ ten ."
The other was In@@ di@@ an cri@@ ck@@ et .
"Now , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly we had to su@@ pp@@ ort city le@@ ag@@ u@@ es ."
But the people getting into these city le@@ ag@@ u@@ es were people who were ta@@ king their cu@@ es from the W@@ est .
"A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a is a home of le@@ ag@@ u@@ es . And they said , &quot; Ri@@ ght , we &apos;ll buil@@ d some g@@ lit@@ z@@ y le@@ ag@@ u@@ es here in In@@ di@@ a . &quot;"
But was In@@ di@@ a ready for it ?
"@@ Because cri@@ ck@@ et , for a long time in In@@ di@@ a was always organ@@ iz@@ ed ."
"It was never pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ed , it was never so@@ ld — it was organ@@ iz@@ ed ."
"And look what they did with our be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful , n@@ ice , si@@ mple fami@@ ly ga@@ me ."
"A@@ ll of a su@@ dd@@ en , you had that happen@@ ing ."
( M@@ us@@ ic ) A@@ n op@@ en@@ ing cer@@ em@@ on@@ y to mat@@ ch every other .
This was an In@@ di@@ a that was bu@@ ying C@@ or@@ ve@@ tt@@ es . This was an In@@ di@@ a that was bu@@ ying J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar .
This was an In@@ di@@ a that was ad@@ ding more mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones p@@ er mon@@ th than Ne@@ w Z@@ e@@ al@@ and &apos;s p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation tw@@ ice over .
"So , it was a different In@@ di@@ a ."
"But it was also a s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly more or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x In@@ di@@ a that was very happ@@ y to be mo@@ der@@ n , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people ."
"And so , they were ag@@ ha@@ st when the ch@@ e@@ er@@ le@@ ad@@ ers ar@@ ri@@ ved ."
"E@@ very@@ one sec@@ re@@ tly w@@ at@@ ch@@ ed them , but every@@ one cl@@ a@@ im@@ ed not to ."
( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( Laughter ) The new ow@@ n@@ ers of In@@ di@@ an cri@@ ck@@ et were not the old pr@@ in@@ ces .
They were not bu@@ re@@ a@@ uc@@ r@@ at@@ s who were for@@ c@@ ed into sp@@ ort because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who r@@ an s@@ eri@@ ous comp@@ an@@ ies .
"And so they started pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing cri@@ ck@@ et big time , started pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing cl@@ u@@ b@@ s big time ."
And they &apos;ve started pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing them with hu@@ ge money be@@ h@@ ind it .
"I mean the I@@ P@@ L had 2.@@ 3 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars before a b@@ all was bo@@ wl@@ ed , 1.@@ 6 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars for t@@ el@@ e@@ vi@@ sion re@@ v@@ en@@ ue over 10 years , and another 7@@ 0 million doll@@ ars pl@@ us from all these fr@@ an@@ ch@@ is@@ es that were p@@ ut@@ ting in money . And then they had to ap@@ pe@@ al to their ci@@ ties , but they had to do it like the W@@ est , right ? Because we are se@@ tting up le@@ ag@@ u@@ es ."
But what they were very good at doing was making it very lo@@ c@@ aliz@@ ed .
"So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not M@@ an@@ ch@@ est@@ er Un@@ ited st@@ y@@ le pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion , but very M@@ umb@@ a@@ i st@@ y@@ le pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion . Ta@@ ke a look ."
"( M@@ us@@ ic ) O@@ f course , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ay@@ be they d@@ ance better than they pl@@ ay . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it chan@@ ged the way we loo@@ ked at cri@@ ck@@ et ."
"A@@ ll al@@ ong , if you wanted a y@@ oun@@ g cri@@ c@@ ke@@ ter , you pic@@ ked him up from the b@@ yl@@ an@@ es of your own little lo@@ c@@ ality , your own city , and you were very pr@@ ou@@ d of the system that produc@@ ed those cri@@ c@@ ke@@ ters ."
"Now , all of the su@@ dd@@ en , if you were to bo@@ w@@ l a sh@@ o@@ t — if M@@ umb@@ a@@ i were to bo@@ w@@ l a sh@@ o@@ t , for example , they nee@@ dn &apos;t go to K@@ al@@ ba@@ de@@ v@@ i or S@@ hi@@ va@@ j@@ i P@@ ar@@ k or some@@ where to s@@ our@@ ce them , they could go to Tr@@ in@@ id@@ ad ."
"This was the new In@@ di@@ a , w@@ as@@ n &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can s@@ our@@ ce from any@@ where as long as you get the best produc@@ t at the best pri@@ ce ."
"And all of a su@@ dd@@ en , In@@ di@@ an sp@@ ort had a@@ wa@@ k@@ en@@ ed to the re@@ ality that you can s@@ our@@ ce the best produc@@ t for the best pri@@ ce any@@ where in the world ."
"So , the M@@ umb@@ a@@ i In@@ di@@ ans f@@ le@@ w in D@@ w@@ ay@@ n@@ e B@@ ra@@ v@@ o from Tr@@ in@@ id@@ ad and T@@ ob@@ ago , over@@ ni@@ ght .

( Laughter ) N@@ ever would In@@ di@@ a have thought on this sc@@ ale before .
"N@@ ever would In@@ di@@ a have said , &quot; &quot; I want a pl@@ ay@@ er to pl@@ ay one ga@@ me for me , and I will use a cor@@ p@@ or@@ ate j@@ et to s@@ end him all the way back to K@@ ing@@ st@@ on , J@@ a@@ ma@@ ic@@ a to pl@@ ay a ga@@ me . &quot; &quot; And I just thought to my@@ self , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , we &apos;ve ar@@ ri@@ ved some@@ where in the world , you know ?"
"We have ar@@ ri@@ ved some@@ where . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started mar@@ r@@ ying the two most important things in In@@ di@@ an cri@@ ck@@ et , which is cri@@ ck@@ et and the mo@@ vi@@ es in In@@ di@@ an en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment ."
There is cri@@ ck@@ et and the mo@@ vi@@ es .
And they came together because people in the mo@@ vi@@ es now started ow@@ ning cl@@ u@@ b@@ s .
"And so , people started going to the cri@@ ck@@ et to w@@ at@@ ch P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a ."
They started going to the cri@@ ck@@ et to w@@ at@@ ch S@@ ha@@ h Ru@@ k@@ h K@@ ha@@ n .
And something very interesting happened .
We started getting s@@ ong and d@@ ance in In@@ di@@ an cri@@ ck@@ et .
And so it started re@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ ing the In@@ di@@ an mo@@ vi@@ es more and more .
"And of course , if you were on P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a &apos;s te@@ am — as you will see on the cli@@ p that f@@ ol@@ low@@ s — if you did well , you got a hu@@ g from P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a ."
So that was the ul@@ tim@@ ate reas@@ on to do well . Ta@@ ke a look — every@@ one &apos;s w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a .
