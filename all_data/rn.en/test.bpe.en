"B@@ y the end of this year , there &apos;ll be ne@@ ar@@ ly a bil@@ lion people on this plan@@ et that ac@@ ti@@ ve@@ ly use soci@@ al ne@@ t@@ working s@@ it@@ es ."
The one thing that all of them have in comm@@ on is that they &apos;re going to di@@ e .
"W@@ hi@@ le that might be a some@@ what mor@@ bi@@ d thought , I think it has some really pro@@ found imp@@ li@@ ca@@ tions that are wor@@ th ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing ."
"Wh@@ at first got me thinking about this was a b@@ lo@@ g p@@ ost au@@ th@@ o@@ red ear@@ li@@ er this year by D@@ er@@ e@@ k K@@ . M@@ ill@@ er , who was a sci@@ ence and technology j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist who di@@ ed of can@@ c@@ er ."
And what M@@ ill@@ er did was have his fami@@ ly and fri@@ en@@ ds wr@@ ite a p@@ ost that went out sh@@ ort@@ ly after he di@@ ed .
H@@ ere &apos;s what he wr@@ ot@@ e in star@@ ting that out .
"H@@ e said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ere it is . I &apos;m de@@ ad , and this is my last p@@ ost to my b@@ lo@@ g ."
"In ad@@ v@@ ance , I as@@ ked that on@@ ce my body fin@@ ally sh@@ ut down from the p@@ uni@@ sh@@ m@@ ents of my can@@ c@@ er , then my fami@@ ly and fri@@ en@@ ds publi@@ s@@ h this pre@@ par@@ ed m@@ ess@@ age I wr@@ ot@@ e — the first part of the pro@@ cess of tur@@ ning this from an ac@@ tive we@@ bs@@ ite to an ar@@ ch@@ i@@ ve . &quot; &quot; Now , wh@@ i@@ le as a j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist , M@@ ill@@ er &apos;s ar@@ ch@@ i@@ ve may have been better wr@@ it@@ ten and more car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly cur@@ ated than most , the fact of the mat@@ ter is that all of us today are cre@@ ating an ar@@ ch@@ i@@ ve that &apos;s something comple@@ tely different than any@@ thing that &apos;s been cre@@ ated by any pre@@ vi@@ ous gener@@ ation ."
C@@ on@@ si@@ der a few st@@ at@@ s for a mom@@ ent .
Ri@@ ght now there are 4@@ 8 h@@ our@@ s of vi@@ de@@ o being up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed to Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be every sing@@ le min@@ ut@@ e .
There are 20@@ 0 million T@@ we@@ e@@ ts being pos@@ ted every day .
And the a@@ ver@@ age F@@ ac@@ e@@ book us@@ er is cre@@ ating 9@@ 0 piec@@ es of cont@@ ent each mon@@ th .
"So when you think about your par@@ ents or your gr@@ and@@ par@@ ents , at best they may have cre@@ ated some ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s or home vi@@ de@@ o@@ s , or a di@@ ary that li@@ ves in a bo@@ x some@@ where ."
"But today we &apos;re all cre@@ ating this incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly ri@@ ch di@@ g@@ it@@ al ar@@ ch@@ i@@ ve that &apos;s going to live in the cl@@ ou@@ d in@@ de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely , years after we &apos;re g@@ one ."
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing opp@@ ort@@ uni@@ ties for techno@@ logi@@ sts .
"Now to be c@@ le@@ ar , I &apos;m a j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist and not a techno@@ lo@@ g@@ ist , so what I &apos;d like to do b@@ ri@@ ef@@ ly is pa@@ int a pic@@ ture of what the pres@@ ent and the future are going to look like ."
Now we &apos;re al@@ ready see@@ ing some ser@@ v@@ ic@@ es that are desig@@ ned to let us deci@@ de what happen@@ s to our on@@ line pro@@ fi@@ le and our soci@@ al medi@@ a ac@@ coun@@ ts after we di@@ e .
"O@@ n@@ e of them actually , f@@ it@@ t@@ ing@@ ly enough , found me when I ch@@ ec@@ ked into a d@@ el@@ i at a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k on f@@ our@@ s@@ qu@@ are ."
( R@@ ec@@ or@@ ding ) Ad@@ am O@@ st@@ ro@@ w : H@@ ell@@ o .
De@@ ath : Ad@@ am ?
A@@ O : Y@@ ea@@ h .
"D@@ e@@ ath : De@@ ath can ca@@ t@@ ch you any@@ where , any@@ time , even at the Or@@ g@@ an@@ ic ."
A@@ O : Wh@@ o is this ?
De@@ ath : G@@ o to i@@ fi@@ di@@ e@@ .@@ ne@@ t before it &apos;s too l@@ ate .
"( Laughter ) Ad@@ am O@@ st@@ ro@@ w : K@@ ind of cre@@ ep@@ y , right ?"
"So what that ser@@ v@@ ice does , quite si@@ mp@@ ly , is let you create a m@@ ess@@ age or a vi@@ de@@ o that can be pos@@ ted to F@@ ac@@ e@@ book after you di@@ e ."
"A@@ no@@ ther ser@@ v@@ ice right now is called 1@@ ,000 M@@ em@@ or@@ ies ."
"And what this le@@ ts you do is create an on@@ line tri@@ bu@@ te to your lo@@ ved ones , comple@@ te with ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s and vi@@ de@@ o@@ s and stor@@ ies that they can p@@ ost after you di@@ e ."
But what I think comes next is f@@ ar more interesting .
"Now a lot of you are prob@@ ably fami@@ li@@ ar with De@@ b Ro@@ y who , back in M@@ ar@@ ch , de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated how he was able to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze more than 90@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s of home vi@@ de@@ o ."
"I think as m@@ ach@@ in@@ es &apos; ab@@ ility to understand human l@@ an@@ gu@@ age and pro@@ cess v@@ ast am@@ oun@@ ts of data cont@@ in@@ u@@ es to im@@ pro@@ ve , it &apos;s going to become pos@@ sible to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze an enti@@ re life &apos;s wor@@ th of cont@@ ent — the T@@ we@@ e@@ ts , the ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s , the vi@@ de@@ o@@ s , the b@@ lo@@ g pos@@ ts — that we &apos;re produc@@ ing in s@@ uch ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve numb@@ ers ."
"And I think as that happen@@ s , it &apos;s going to become pos@@ sible for our di@@ g@@ it@@ al per@@ s@@ on@@ as to cont@@ in@@ ue to inter@@ act in the real world long after we &apos;re g@@ one th@@ an@@ ks to the va@@ st@@ n@@ ess of the am@@ oun@@ t of cont@@ ent we &apos;re cre@@ ating and technology &apos;s ab@@ ility to make sense of it all ."
Now we &apos;re al@@ ready star@@ ting to see some exper@@ im@@ ents here .
"O@@ n@@ e ser@@ v@@ ice called M@@ y N@@ ex@@ t T@@ we@@ et an@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ es your enti@@ re Tw@@ it@@ ter st@@ re@@ am , everything you &apos;ve pos@@ ted on@@ to Tw@@ it@@ ter , to make some pre@@ di@@ c@@ tions as to what you might say next ."
"Well right now , as you can see , the res@@ ul@@ ts can be some@@ what com@@ i@@ cal ."
"You can ima@@ gine what something like this might look like fi@@ ve , 10 or 2@@ 0 years from now as our tech@@ ni@@ cal cap@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties im@@ pro@@ ve ."
"T@@ a@@ king it a ste@@ p f@@ ur@@ ther , M@@ I@@ T &apos;s medi@@ a la@@ b is working on ro@@ bot@@ s that can inter@@ act more like hum@@ ans ."
But what if those ro@@ bot@@ s were able to inter@@ act bas@@ ed on the uni@@ qu@@ e ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic@@ s of a sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c person bas@@ ed on the h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ ands of piec@@ es of cont@@ ent that person produc@@ es in their li@@ fe@@ time ?
"F@@ in@@ ally , think back to this fam@@ ous sc@@ en@@ e from elec@@ tion ni@@ ght 2@@ 00@@ 8 back in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , where C@@ N@@ N be@@ am@@ ed a live ho@@ lo@@ gra@@ m of hi@@ p ho@@ p ar@@ ti@@ st w@@ ill@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ am into their stu@@ di@@ o for an inter@@ vi@@ e@@ w with An@@ der@@ son Co@@ op@@ er ."
What if we were able to use that same t@@ yp@@ e of technology to be@@ am a re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of our lo@@ ved ones into our li@@ ving ro@@ om@@ s — inter@@ ac@@ ting in a very li@@ fe@@ like way bas@@ ed on all the cont@@ ent they cre@@ ated wh@@ i@@ le they were ali@@ ve ?
I think that &apos;s going to become comple@@ tely pos@@ sible as the am@@ oun@@ t of data we &apos;re produc@@ ing and technology &apos;s ab@@ ility to understand it bot@@ h exp@@ and exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally .
"Now in cl@@ os@@ ing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our re@@ ality — and if so , what it means for a de@@ fin@@ i@@ tion of life and everything that comes after it ."

It was an af@@ ter@@ no@@ on in the f@@ all of 2@@ 00@@ 5 .
So I w@@ and@@ er@@ ed down the h@@ all@@ way to my col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue Ch@@ r@@ is H@@ an@@ s@@ en &apos;s off@@ ice .
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is had been at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U for more than 3@@ 0 years , so he had de@@ ep in@@ sti@@ tu@@ tional kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge and in@@ si@@ gh@@ ts ."
I had been inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ating a number of is@@ su@@ es at the inter@@ sec@@ tion of sci@@ ence and ci@@ vi@@ l li@@ b@@ er@@ ties — su@@ p@@ er interesting .
"But I wanted the A@@ C@@ L@@ U to en@@ g@@ age these is@@ su@@ es in a much bi@@ gg@@ er way , in a way that could really make a differ@@ ence ."
"So Ch@@ r@@ is c@@ ut right to the c@@ ha@@ se , and he sa@@ ys , &quot; W@@ ell , of all the is@@ su@@ es you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the to@@ p fi@@ ve ? &quot;"
"@@ &quot; Y@@ es , you know , p@@ at@@ ents on human gen@@ es . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; N@@ o !
You &apos;re t@@ ell@@ ing me that the U@@ S gover@@ n@@ ment has been is@@ su@@ ing p@@ at@@ ents on part of the human body ?
That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my off@@ ice and s@@ ent Ch@@ r@@ is three ar@@ ti@@ cl@@ es .
"And 2@@ 0 min@@ ut@@ es l@@ ater , he came b@@ ur@@ st@@ ing in my off@@ ice ."
&quot; O@@ h my go@@ d ! You &apos;re right ! Wh@@ o can we su@@ e ? &quot;
"( Laughter ) Now Ch@@ r@@ is is a really b@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant la@@ wy@@ er , but he k@@ new al@@ most no@@ thing about p@@ at@@ ent la@@ w and cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly no@@ thing about gen@@ e@@ tic@@ s ."
"I k@@ new something about gen@@ e@@ tic@@ s , but I w@@ as@@ n &apos;t even a la@@ wy@@ er , let al@@ one a p@@ at@@ ent la@@ wy@@ er ."
"F@@ ir@@ st , we nee@@ ded to understand ex@@ ac@@ tly what was p@@ at@@ en@@ ted when some@@ one p@@ at@@ en@@ ted a gen@@ e ."
"G@@ en@@ e p@@ at@@ ents t@@ yp@@ ically con@@ ta@@ in do@@ z@@ en@@ s of cl@@ a@@ im@@ s , but the most cont@@ ro@@ ver@@ si@@ al of these are to so@@ -@@ called &quot; &quot; is@@ ol@@ ated DN@@ A &quot; &quot; — na@@ me@@ ly , a piec@@ e of DN@@ A that has been re@@ mo@@ ved from a c@@ ell ."
"And the p@@ at@@ ents w@@ er@@ en &apos;t just to a par@@ tic@@ ular gen@@ e that they is@@ ol@@ ated , but on every pos@@ sible ver@@ sion of that gen@@ e ."
So what does that mean ?
It also means that the p@@ at@@ ent h@@ ol@@ der has the right to st@@ op any@@ one from using that gen@@ e in re@@ sear@@ ch or cl@@ in@@ i@@ cal te@@ st@@ ing .
But then they went b@@ an@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t and they never off@@ er@@ ed it .
G@@ en@@ e p@@ at@@ ents c@@ lear@@ ly were a problem and were h@@ ar@@ m@@ ing pa@@ ti@@ ents .
But was there a way we could ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge them ?
"And you can &apos;t p@@ at@@ ent la@@ ws of nat@@ ure — the la@@ w of gra@@ v@@ ity , E = m@@ c@@ 2 ."
Th@@ ese things are just too f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al and m@@ ust re@@ ma@@ in f@@ ree to all and res@@ er@@ ved ex@@ cl@@ us@@ i@@ ve@@ ly to n@@ one .
"It se@@ em@@ ed to us that DN@@ A , the most f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al struc@@ ture of life , that co@@ des for the produc@@ tion of all of our prot@@ e@@ ins , is bot@@ h a produc@@ t of nat@@ ure and a la@@ w of nat@@ ure , re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of whe@@ ther it &apos;s in our bo@@ di@@ es or s@@ it@@ ting in the bot@@ to@@ m of a t@@ est tu@@ be ."
"M@@ ost of them ag@@ re@@ ed that we were right as a mat@@ ter of poli@@ cy , and , at le@@ ast in the@@ ory , as a mat@@ ter of la@@ w ."
Wh@@ y is that ?
There were lit@@ er@@ ally thou@@ s@@ ands of p@@ at@@ ents on human gen@@ es .
So we se@@ t out to buil@@ d our ca@@ se .
We se@@ t out to id@@ enti@@ f@@ y a gen@@ e-@@ p@@ at@@ ent h@@ ol@@ der that was vi@@ g@@ or@@ ous@@ ly en@@ for@@ c@@ ing its p@@ at@@ ents and then to organ@@ iz@@ e a b@@ ro@@ ad co@@ ali@@ tion of pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff@@ s and exper@@ ts that could tell the cour@@ t about all the ways that these p@@ at@@ ents were h@@ ar@@ m@@ ing pa@@ ti@@ ents and in@@ no@@ v@@ ation .
"We found the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ d@@ ate to su@@ e in My@@ ri@@ ad G@@ en@@ e@@ tic@@ s , a comp@@ any that &apos;s bas@@ ed in S@@ al@@ t La@@ ke C@@ ity , U@@ ta@@ h ."
W@@ om@@ en with cer@@ ta@@ in mu@@ ta@@ tions al@@ ong these gen@@ es are con@@ si@@ der@@ ed to be at a si@@ g@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ an@@ tly incre@@ as@@ ed ri@@ s@@ k of develop@@ ing bre@@ ast and o@@ v@@ ari@@ an can@@ c@@ er .
It had st@@ opp@@ ed sh@@ ar@@ ing its cl@@ in@@ i@@ cal data with the inter@@ na@@ tional sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c comm@@ unity .
"And per@@ h@@ ap@@ s wor@@ st of all , for a per@@ i@@ od of se@@ ver@@ al years , My@@ ri@@ ad re@@ f@@ used to up@@ d@@ ate its t@@ est to in@@ cl@@ u@@ de ad@@ di@@ tional mu@@ ta@@ tions that had been id@@ enti@@ fi@@ ed by a te@@ am of re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers in Fr@@ ance ."
This is K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en Ma@@ xi@@ an .
K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s si@@ ster E@@ il@@ een develop@@ ed bre@@ ast can@@ c@@ er at age 4@@ 0 and she was te@@ st@@ ed by My@@ ri@@ ad .
The t@@ est was ne@@ ga@@ tive .
The fami@@ ly was re@@ li@@ ev@@ ed .
"That me@@ ant that E@@ il@@ een &apos;s can@@ c@@ er most li@@ ke@@ ly didn &apos;t ru@@ n in the fami@@ ly , and that other memb@@ ers of her fami@@ ly didn &apos;t need to be te@@ st@@ ed ."
It tur@@ ned out that K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s si@@ ster was am@@ ong the 1@@ 2 percent who re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved a f@@ al@@ se@@ -@@ ne@@ ga@@ tive t@@ est res@@ ult .
"H@@ ad E@@ il@@ een re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved the pro@@ p@@ er res@@ ult , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en would have then been te@@ st@@ ed , and her o@@ v@@ ari@@ an can@@ c@@ er could have been pre@@ v@@ en@@ ted ."
On@@ e of the ma@@ j@@ or ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges we had in pre@@ par@@ ing the ca@@ se was fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing out how best to comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ te the sci@@ ence .
"So in or@@ der to ar@@ gu@@ e that what My@@ ri@@ ad did was not an inv@@ en@@ tion , and that is@@ ol@@ ated B@@ R@@ C@@ A gen@@ es were produc@@ ts of nat@@ ure , we had to ex@@ pla@@ in a cou@@ ple of bas@@ ic con@@ cep@@ ts , like : What &apos;s a gen@@ e ? What &apos;s DN@@ A ?"
"H@@ ow is DN@@ A is@@ ol@@ ated , and why is@@ n &apos;t that an inv@@ en@@ tion ?"
"You might be able to p@@ at@@ ent the pro@@ cess for min@@ ing the go@@ ld , but you can &apos;t p@@ at@@ ent the go@@ ld it@@ self ."
"And the go@@ ld , on@@ ce it &apos;s ex@@ tr@@ ac@@ ted , can c@@ lear@@ ly be used for all s@@ or@@ ts of things that it cou@@ ldn &apos;t be used for when it was in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ in ; you can make j@@ ew@@ el@@ ry out of it for example — still can &apos;t p@@ at@@ ent the go@@ ld , it &apos;s still go@@ ld ."
"So now it &apos;s 2@@ 00@@ 9 , and we &apos;re ready to fi@@ le our ca@@ se ."
"I mean , our b@@ ri@@ e@@ f — it was pret@@ ty good , but not this good ."
How did he devel@@ op s@@ uch a de@@ ep underst@@ an@@ ding of this is@@ su@@ e in s@@ uch a sh@@ ort time ?
We just could not com@@ pre@@ h@@ end how this had happened .
And here things got really interesting .
"F@@ ir@@ st , in a pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al mom@@ ent of this ca@@ se , the U@@ S gover@@ n@@ ment sw@@ it@@ ch@@ ed si@@ des ."
"But now in di@@ rec@@ t op@@ pos@@ i@@ tion to its own p@@ at@@ ent off@@ ice , the U@@ S gover@@ n@@ ment f@@ il@@ es a b@@ ri@@ e@@ f that st@@ ates that is has re@@ con@@ si@@ der@@ ed this is@@ su@@ e in light of the di@@ stri@@ c@@ t cour@@ t &apos;s op@@ in@@ i@@ on , and has con@@ cl@@ u@@ ded that is@@ ol@@ ated DN@@ A is not p@@ at@@ ent e@@ li@@ gi@@ ble ."
And we did .
"E@@ n@@ ds up s@@ pl@@ it deci@@ sion , 2 to 1 ."
"But the two ju@@ d@@ ges who r@@ ul@@ ed aga@@ in@@ st us , did so for comple@@ tely different reas@@ ons ."
"The first one , Ju@@ d@@ ge L@@ ou@@ ri@@ e , made up his own no@@ vel , bi@@ o@@ logi@@ cal the@@ ory — t@@ ot@@ ally wr@@ ong ."
"But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to s@@ ha@@ ke up the bi@@ ot@@ ec@@ h in@@ du@@ str@@ y . &quot; &quot; The th@@ ir@@ d , Ju@@ d@@ ge Br@@ y@@ son , ag@@ re@@ ed with us ."
So now we s@@ ou@@ ght re@@ vi@@ e@@ w by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
"And when you pe@@ ti@@ tion the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , you have to pres@@ ent a question that you want the C@@ our@@ t to an@@ sw@@ er ."
"U@@ su@@ ally these ques@@ tions take the form of a su@@ per@@ -@@ long par@@ ag@@ r@@ ap@@ h , like a whole p@@ age long with l@@ ots and l@@ ots of cl@@ a@@ us@@ es , &quot; wh@@ er@@ e@@ in this &quot; and &quot; ther@@ ef@@ ore that . &quot;"

F@@ our wor@@ ds : A@@ re human gen@@ es p@@ at@@ ent@@ able ?
"Now when Ch@@ r@@ is first as@@ ked me what I thought of these wor@@ ds , I said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , I don &apos;t know ."

"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is and I s@@ at qu@@ i@@ e@@ tly in the h@@ all@@ way , mom@@ ents before he was to wal@@ k in and ar@@ gu@@ e the most important ca@@ se of his car@@ e@@ er ."
"A@@ l@@ so in the room were three le@@ ad@@ ers of the Hu@@ man G@@ en@@ ome P@@ ro@@ j@@ ect , in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding the co@@ -@@ disc@@ over@@ er of DN@@ A hi@@ m@@ self , J@@ am@@ es W@@ at@@ son , who had su@@ bm@@ it@@ ted a b@@ ri@@ e@@ f to the cour@@ t , where he re@@ f@@ er@@ red to gen@@ e p@@ at@@ en@@ ting as &quot; &quot; l@@ un@@ ac@@ y . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of the comm@@ uni@@ ties re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted in this room and the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions each had made to make this day a re@@ ality sp@@ o@@ ke v@@ ol@@ um@@ es to what was at sta@@ ke ."

"And as I gre@@ w up , it be@@ came wor@@ se and wor@@ se , And I started to think of it as a form of cont@@ ro@@ l ."
"But of course , I could never say any@@ thing , because the un@@ c@@ le is a re@@ spec@@ ted fi@@ g@@ ure in the In@@ di@@ an fami@@ ly ."
And the s@@ it@@ u@@ ation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ sti@@ fi@@ ed me the most was his use of a l@@ and@@ line t@@ el@@ e@@ ph@@ one .
He would ho@@ ld on to the re@@ ce@@ i@@ ver and exp@@ ect me to di@@ al a number for him .
"And so as a resp@@ on@@ se and as a gi@@ ft to my un@@ c@@ le , I made him &quot; &quot; The Un@@ c@@ le Ph@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it re@@ qu@@ i@@ res two people to use it ."
It &apos;s ex@@ ac@@ tly the way my un@@ c@@ le us@@ es a ph@@ one that &apos;s desig@@ ned for one person .
"But the problem is that , when I left home and went to col@@ le@@ ge , I started m@@ is@@ sing his comm@@ ands ."
And so I made him a go@@ l@@ d@@ en ty@@ pe@@ wr@@ it@@ er through which he could di@@ sp@@ en@@ se his comm@@ ands to ne@@ p@@ he@@ ws and ni@@ ec@@ es around the world as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So what he had to do was take a piec@@ e of p@@ ap@@ er , ro@@ ll it into the car@@ ri@@ age , t@@ yp@@ e his e@@ ma@@ il or comm@@ and and p@@ ul@@ l the p@@ ap@@ er out ."
This de@@ v@@ ice would au@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ tic@@ ally s@@ end the in@@ ten@@ ded person the le@@ tter as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So here you can see , we em@@ be@@ d@@ ded a lot of elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s that underst@@ ands all of the m@@ ech@@ an@@ i@@ cal ac@@ tions and con@@ ver@@ ts it to di@@ g@@ it@@ al ."
So my un@@ c@@ le is only de@@ al@@ ing with a m@@ ech@@ an@@ i@@ cal inter@@ face .
"And of course , the ob@@ j@@ ect had to be very gr@@ and and have a sense of r@@ it@@ u@@ al@@ is@@ m , the way my un@@ c@@ le li@@ kes it ."
"The next work is a s@@ oun@@ d-@@ sen@@ si@@ tive in@@ st@@ all@@ ation that we a@@ ff@@ ec@@ tion@@ at@@ ely call &quot; &quot; The Py@@ g@@ mi@@ es . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a no@@ tion of being sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sen@@ si@@ tive and s@@ we@@ et cre@@ at@@ u@@ res ."
"So how it wor@@ ks is we have these p@@ an@@ el@@ s , which we have on the w@@ all , and be@@ h@@ ind them , we have these little cre@@ at@@ u@@ res which hi@@ de ."
"And as so@@ on as it &apos;s s@@ il@@ ent , they sort of cre@@ ep out ."
"And if it &apos;s even more s@@ il@@ ent , they st@@ re@@ t@@ ch their nec@@ ks out ."
"And at the s@@ li@@ gh@@ t@@ est s@@ ound , they hi@@ de back again ."
So we had these p@@ an@@ el@@ s on three w@@ all@@ s of a room .
And we had over 50@@ 0 of these little p@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es hi@@ ding be@@ h@@ ind them .
So this is how it wor@@ ks .
This is a vi@@ de@@ o prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"So when it &apos;s qu@@ i@@ et , it &apos;s sort of coming out from be@@ h@@ ind the p@@ an@@ el@@ s ."
"And they he@@ ar like hum@@ ans do , or real cre@@ at@@ u@@ res do ."
So they get im@@ m@@ un@@ e to s@@ oun@@ ds that sc@@ are them after a@@ wh@@ i@@ le .
And they don &apos;t re@@ act to bac@@ k@@ gr@@ ound s@@ oun@@ ds .
You &apos;ll he@@ ar a tra@@ in in mom@@ ent that they don &apos;t re@@ act to .
( No@@ i@@ se ) But they re@@ act to fo@@ re@@ gr@@ ound s@@ oun@@ ds . You &apos;ll he@@ ar that in a second .
( W@@ hi@@ st@@ l@@ ing ) So we wor@@ ked very hard to make them as li@@ fe@@ like as pos@@ sible .
"So each p@@ y@@ g@@ my has its own be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or , p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e , mo@@ od sw@@ ings , per@@ s@@ on@@ ali@@ ties and so on ."
So this is a very ear@@ ly prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"O@@ f course , it got much better after that ."
"And we made them re@@ act to people , but we found that people were being quite pl@@ ay@@ ful and chil@@ d@@ like with them ."
This is a vi@@ de@@ o in@@ st@@ all@@ ation called &quot; &quot; The M@@ is@@ sing P@@ er@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with pl@@ ay@@ ing with the no@@ tion of in@@ vi@@ si@@ b@@ ility .
How would it be pos@@ sible to experi@@ ence a sense of in@@ vi@@ si@@ b@@ ility ?
"So we wor@@ ked with a comp@@ any that sp@@ eci@@ aliz@@ es in ca@@ m@@ er@@ a sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance , and we as@@ ked them to devel@@ op a piec@@ e of so@@ f@@ tw@@ are with us , using a ca@@ m@@ er@@ a that could look at people in the room , tr@@ ack them and re@@ place one person with the bac@@ k@@ gr@@ ound , r@@ en@@ der@@ ing them in@@ vi@@ sible ."
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very ear@@ ly prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"O@@ n the right side you can see my col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue So@@ re@@ n , who &apos;s actually in the space ."
"And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the pro@@ c@@ ess@@ ed vi@@ de@@ o where the ca@@ m@@ er@@ a has made him in@@ vi@@ sible ."
So@@ re@@ n en@@ ters the room . Po@@ p ! He go@@ es in@@ vi@@ sible .
And you can see that the ca@@ m@@ er@@ a is tr@@ ac@@ king him and er@@ as@@ ing .
"It &apos;s a very ear@@ ly vi@@ de@@ o , so we ha@@ ven &apos;t ye@@ t de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pret@@ ty so@@ on , l@@ ater ."
"So how we used it was in a room where we had a ca@@ m@@ er@@ a looking into the space , and we had one mon@@ it@@ or , one on each w@@ all ."
"And as people wal@@ ked into the room , they would see the@@ m@@ selves in the mon@@ it@@ or , ex@@ cep@@ t with one differ@@ ence : one person was con@@ st@@ an@@ tly in@@ vi@@ sible wh@@ er@@ ever they mo@@ ved in the room ."
"So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Su@@ n S@@ ha@@ d@@ ow . &quot; &quot; And it was al@@ most like a sh@@ e@@ et of p@@ ap@@ er , like a c@@ ut@@ out of a chil@@ d@@ like d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing of an o@@ il sp@@ ill or a su@@ n ."
"And from the fr@@ on@@ t , this ob@@ j@@ ect ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed to be very str@@ ong and ro@@ b@@ ust , and from the side , it al@@ most se@@ em@@ ed very we@@ a@@ k ."
"So people would wal@@ king into the room and they &apos;d al@@ most ig@@ n@@ ore it , thinking it was some c@@ ra@@ p l@@ ay@@ ing around ."
"But as so@@ on as they p@@ as@@ s@@ ed by , it would start to cli@@ m@@ b up the w@@ all in j@@ er@@ k@@ y f@@ as@@ hi@@ on ."
"And it would get ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ed , and it would coll@@ ap@@ se every time ."
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ i@@ ca@@ ture of an up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down man .
"H@@ is he@@ ad is so he@@ av@@ y , ful@@ l of he@@ av@@ y thou@@ gh@@ ts , that it &apos;s sort of f@@ all@@ en into his h@@ at , and his body &apos;s gro@@ wn out of him al@@ most like a pl@@ ant ."
W@@ ell what he does is he mo@@ ves around in a very dr@@ un@@ k@@ en f@@ as@@ hi@@ on on his he@@ ad in a very un@@ pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able and ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly s@@ low mo@@ v@@ ement .
And it &apos;s kind of con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ ed by that c@@ ir@@ c@@ le .
"@@ Because if that c@@ ir@@ c@@ le w@@ er@@ en &apos;t there , and the f@@ lo@@ or was very even , it would start to wan@@ der about in the space ."
And there &apos;s no wi@@ res .
"So I &apos;ll just show you an in@@ st@@ ance — so when people en@@ ter the room , it ac@@ tiv@@ ates this ob@@ j@@ ect ."
"And it very s@@ low@@ ly , over a few min@@ ut@@ es , sort of pa@@ in@@ ful@@ ly go@@ es up , and then it ga@@ ins mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m and it loo@@ ks like it &apos;s al@@ most about to f@@ all ."
"And this is an important mom@@ ent , because we wanted to in@@ still in the vi@@ ew@@ er an in@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ t to al@@ most go and help , or sa@@ ve the su@@ bj@@ ect ."
"But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ag@@ es to p@@ ul@@ l it@@ self up ."
"So this work was a real tech@@ ni@@ cal ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge for us , and we wor@@ ked very hard , like most of our wor@@ ks , over years to get the m@@ ech@@ an@@ ic@@ s right and the e@@ qu@@ i@@ li@@ b@@ ri@@ um and the d@@ yn@@ am@@ ic@@ s ."
"And it was very important for us to est@@ ab@@ li@@ s@@ h the ex@@ act mom@@ ent that it would f@@ all , because if we made it in a way that it would t@@ opp@@ le over , then it would da@@ ma@@ ge it@@ self , and if it didn &apos;t f@@ all enough , it w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t in@@ still that f@@ at@@ al@@ is@@ m , or that sense of wan@@ ting to go and help it ."
So I &apos;m going to show you a very qu@@ ic@@ k vi@@ de@@ o where we are doing a t@@ est sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o — it &apos;s much fa@@ ster .
That &apos;s my col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue . He &apos;s let it go .
"Now he &apos;s getting n@@ er@@ v@@ ous , so he &apos;s going to go ca@@ t@@ ch it ."
"But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ag@@ es to li@@ ft it@@ self up on its own ."
"So this is a work that we were very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with , working with the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic of fu@@ r em@@ be@@ d@@ ded with thou@@ s@@ ands of t@@ in@@ y different si@@ z@@ es of fi@@ b@@ er op@@ tic@@ s , which tw@@ in@@ k@@ le like the ni@@ ght sk@@ y ."
And it &apos;s at the sc@@ ale of the ni@@ ght sk@@ y .
"So we wr@@ app@@ ed this around a b@@ lo@@ b-@@ like form , which is in the sh@@ ap@@ e of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which was h@@ an@@ ging from the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
"And the idea was to sort of con@@ tr@@ ast something very co@@ ld and di@@ st@@ ant and ab@@ str@@ act like the uni@@ ver@@ se into the fami@@ li@@ ar form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which is very com@@ for@@ ting and in@@ tim@@ ate ."
"And the idea was that at some point you would st@@ op looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar and you would al@@ most per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve it to be a ho@@ le in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing ni@@ ght sk@@ y ."
"So this is the last work , and a work in pro@@ gre@@ s@@ s , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ace F@@ ill@@ er . &quot; &quot; W@@ ell ima@@ gine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big st@@ an@@ ding in fr@@ on@@ t of you in the mi@@ dd@@ le of the room , and as you ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ed it , it tri@@ ed to in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ate you by gro@@ w@@ ing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s tw@@ ice its he@@ i@@ ght and &#9@@ 1@@ ; ei@@ ght &#9@@ 3@@ ; times its v@@ ol@@ u@@ me ."
And so this ob@@ j@@ ect is con@@ st@@ an@@ tly exp@@ an@@ ding and con@@ tr@@ ac@@ ting to create a d@@ yn@@ am@@ ic with people mo@@ ving around it — al@@ most like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a sec@@ re@@ t with@@ in its se@@ am@@ s or something .
"So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gi@@ ves us a lot of pa@@ in in our work over years and years ."
But we use it because we &apos;re interest@@ ed in the way that it can help us to ex@@ pres@@ s the e@@ mo@@ tions and be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or@@ al p@@ at@@ ter@@ ns in these cre@@ at@@ u@@ res that we create .
"And on@@ ce a cre@@ at@@ ure p@@ op@@ s into our min@@ ds , it &apos;s al@@ most like the pro@@ cess of cre@@ ation is to disc@@ over the way this cre@@ at@@ ure really wan@@ ts to ex@@ ist and what form it wan@@ ts to take and what way it wan@@ ts to mo@@ ve ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"This is what life nee@@ ds to sur@@ vi@@ ve , all life ."
O@@ r could it have been just right at some other time ?
I love the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t .
It &apos;s tr@@ ue .
Th@@ in@@ k about everything it has br@@ ou@@ ght us .
"Th@@ in@@ k about all the ser@@ v@@ ic@@ es we use , all the con@@ nec@@ tiv@@ ity , all the en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment , all the bus@@ iness , all the comm@@ er@@ ce ."
And it &apos;s happen@@ ing d@@ ur@@ ing our li@@ fe@@ times .
"I &apos;m pret@@ ty s@@ ure that one day we &apos;ll be wr@@ iting hi@@ story bo@@ o@@ ks h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of years from now . This time our gener@@ ation will be re@@ memb@@ er@@ ed as the gener@@ ation that got on@@ line , the gener@@ ation that buil@@ t something really and tr@@ u@@ ly g@@ lob@@ al ."
"But y@@ es , it &apos;s also tr@@ ue that the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t has proble@@ ms , very s@@ eri@@ ous proble@@ ms , proble@@ ms with sec@@ ur@@ ity and proble@@ ms with pri@@ v@@ ac@@ y ."
I &apos;ve sp@@ ent my car@@ e@@ er fi@@ gh@@ ting these proble@@ ms .
So let me show you something .
This here is B@@ ra@@ in .
This is a f@@ lo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k — fi@@ ve and a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ ch f@@ lo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted by B@@ ra@@ in@@ .@@ A@@ .
It &apos;s the first vir@@ us we ever found for P@@ C compu@@ ters .
And we actually know where B@@ ra@@ in came from .
We know because it sa@@ ys so in@@ side the co@@ de .
L@@ et &apos;s take a look .
A@@ ll right .
"That &apos;s the bo@@ o@@ t sec@@ t@@ or of an in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted f@@ lo@@ pp@@ y , and if we take a cl@@ os@@ er look in@@ side , we &apos;ll see that right there , it sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on . &quot; &quot; And then it cont@@ in@@ u@@ es , sa@@ ying , 19@@ 8@@ 6 , B@@ as@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad ."
"And B@@ as@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad are first n@@ am@@ es , Pa@@ ki@@ st@@ an@@ i first n@@ am@@ es ."
"In fact , there &apos;s a ph@@ one number and an ad@@ dre@@ s@@ s in Pa@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) Now , 19@@ 8@@ 6 ."
Now it &apos;s 20@@ 1@@ 1 .
That &apos;s 2@@ 5 years ago .
The P@@ C vir@@ us problem is 2@@ 5 years old now .
"So hal@@ f a year ago , I deci@@ ded to go to Pa@@ ki@@ st@@ an my@@ self ."
"So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a cou@@ ple of ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s I took wh@@ i@@ le I was in Pa@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"This is from the city of La@@ h@@ ore , which is around 30@@ 0 k@@ il@@ om@@ e@@ ters s@@ ou@@ th from Ab@@ bot@@ t@@ ab@@ ad , where B@@ in L@@ ad@@ en was ca@@ u@@ ght ."
H@@ ere &apos;s a ty@@ pi@@ cal st@@ re@@ et vi@@ e@@ w .
"And here &apos;s the st@@ re@@ et or ro@@ ad le@@ ad@@ ing to this buil@@ ding , which is 7@@ 3@@ 0 N@@ iz@@ am b@@ lo@@ c@@ k at Al@@ l@@ am@@ a I@@ q@@ b@@ al T@@ own ."
And I kno@@ c@@ ked on the do@@ or .
( Laughter ) You want to gu@@ ess who op@@ en@@ ed the do@@ or ?
B@@ as@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad ; they are still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here st@@ an@@ ding up is B@@ as@@ it .
S@@ it@@ ting down is his b@@ ro@@ ther Am@@ j@@ ad .
Th@@ ese are the gu@@ ys who wr@@ ot@@ e the first P@@ C vir@@ us .
"Now of course , we had a very interesting disc@@ us@@ sion ."
I as@@ ked them why .
I as@@ ked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fac@@ tion from lear@@ ning that bot@@ h B@@ as@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad had had their compu@@ ters in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted do@@ z@@ en@@ s of times by comple@@ tely un@@ re@@ l@@ ated other vir@@ us@@ es over these years .
So there is some sort of j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce in the world after all .
"Now , the vir@@ us@@ es that we used to see in the 19@@ 80@@ s and 19@@ 90@@ s ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly are not a problem any more ."
So let me just show you a cou@@ ple of ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m r@@ un@@ ning here is a system that en@@ ab@@ l@@ es me to ru@@ n ag@@ e-@@ old pro@@ gra@@ ms on a mo@@ der@@ n compu@@ ter .
So let me just m@@ oun@@ t some dri@@ ves . G@@ o over there .
What we have here is a li@@ st of old vir@@ us@@ es .
So let me just ru@@ n some vir@@ us@@ es on my compu@@ ter .
"F@@ or example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de vir@@ us first ."
"And you can see at the to@@ p of the sc@@ re@@ en , there &apos;s a c@@ enti@@ pe@@ de sc@@ ro@@ ll@@ ing ac@@ r@@ oss your compu@@ ter when you get in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted by this one ."
You know that you &apos;re in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted because it actually show@@ s up .
"H@@ ere &apos;s another one . This is the vir@@ us called Cr@@ as@@ h , inv@@ en@@ ted in R@@ us@@ si@@ a in 19@@ 9@@ 2 ."
L@@ et me show you one which actually ma@@ kes some s@@ ound .
"( Si@@ re@@ n no@@ i@@ se ) And the last example , gu@@ ess what the W@@ al@@ k@@ er vir@@ us does ?"
"Y@@ es , there &apos;s a gu@@ y wal@@ king ac@@ r@@ oss your sc@@ re@@ en on@@ ce you get in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted ."
"So it used to be fa@@ ir@@ ly e@@ as@@ y to know that you &apos;re in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted by a vir@@ us , when the vir@@ us@@ es were wr@@ it@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ by@@ i@@ sts and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are no l@@ on@@ ger being wr@@ it@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ by@@ i@@ sts and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , vir@@ us@@ es are a g@@ lob@@ al problem ."
"Wh@@ at we have here in the bac@@ k@@ gr@@ ound is an example of our sy@@ st@@ ems that we ru@@ n in our l@@ ab@@ s , where we tr@@ ack vir@@ us in@@ f@@ ec@@ tions wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just b@@ lo@@ c@@ ked vir@@ us@@ es in S@@ we@@ d@@ en and Ta@@ i@@ w@@ an and R@@ us@@ si@@ a and el@@ se@@ where .
"In fact , if I just con@@ n@@ ect back to our la@@ b sy@@ st@@ ems through the We@@ b , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many vir@@ us@@ es , how many new ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es of m@@ al@@ w@@ are we find every sing@@ le day ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s the l@@ at@@ est vir@@ us we &apos;ve found , in a fi@@ le called S@@ er@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e@@ ."
"And we found it right over here three secon@@ ds ago — the pre@@ vi@@ ous one , si@@ x secon@@ ds ago ."
"And if we just sc@@ ro@@ ll around , it &apos;s just ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve ."
"We find ten@@ s of thou@@ s@@ ands , even h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ ands ."
And that &apos;s the last 2@@ 0 min@@ ut@@ es of m@@ al@@ w@@ are every sing@@ le day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
"Well today , it &apos;s the organ@@ iz@@ ed cri@@ min@@ al g@@ an@@ gs wr@@ iting these vir@@ us@@ es because they make money with their vir@@ us@@ es ."
It &apos;s g@@ an@@ gs like — let &apos;s go to G@@ an@@ g@@ sta@@ B@@ uc@@ k@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
This is a we@@ bs@@ ite op@@ er@@ ating in M@@ os@@ c@@ ow where these gu@@ ys are bu@@ ying in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted compu@@ ters .
"So if you are a vir@@ us wr@@ it@@ er and you &apos;re cap@@ able of in@@ f@@ ec@@ ting W@@ in@@ do@@ ws compu@@ ters , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can s@@ ell those in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted compu@@ ters — some@@ body el@@ se &apos;s compu@@ ters — to these gu@@ ys ."
And they &apos;ll actually p@@ ay you money for those compu@@ ters .
So how do these gu@@ ys then mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze those in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted compu@@ ters ?
"Well there &apos;s m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple different ways , s@@ uch as b@@ an@@ king t@@ ro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your on@@ line b@@ an@@ king ac@@ coun@@ ts when you do on@@ line b@@ an@@ king , or ke@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers ."
"K@@ ey@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers s@@ il@@ ently s@@ it on your compu@@ ter , hi@@ dd@@ en from vi@@ e@@ w , and they rec@@ or@@ d everything you t@@ yp@@ e ."
So you &apos;re s@@ it@@ ting on your compu@@ ter and you &apos;re doing G@@ oo@@ g@@ le sear@@ ch@@ es .
E@@ very sing@@ le G@@ oo@@ g@@ le sear@@ ch you t@@ yp@@ e is sa@@ ved and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
E@@ very sing@@ le e@@ ma@@ il you wr@@ ite is sa@@ ved and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
Sa@@ me thing with every sing@@ le p@@ as@@ s@@ wor@@ d and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are s@@ es@@ si@@ ons where you go on@@ line and do on@@ line p@@ ur@@ c@@ ha@@ ses in any on@@ line st@@ ore .
"@@ Because when you do p@@ ur@@ c@@ ha@@ ses in on@@ line st@@ o@@ res , you will be t@@ yp@@ ing in your na@@ me , the de@@ li@@ very ad@@ dre@@ s@@ s , your cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard number and the cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard sec@@ ur@@ ity co@@ des ."
And here &apos;s an example of a fi@@ le we found from a ser@@ ver a cou@@ ple of we@@ e@@ ks ago .
"That &apos;s the cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard number , that &apos;s the ex@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion d@@ ate , that &apos;s the sec@@ ur@@ ity co@@ de , and that &apos;s the na@@ me of the ow@@ n@@ er of the c@@ ard ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you ga@@ in ac@@ cess to other people &apos;s cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard information , you can just go on@@ line and bu@@ y wh@@ at@@ ever you want with this information ."
"And that , ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly , is a problem ."
We now have a whole under@@ gr@@ ound mar@@ ke@@ t@@ place and bus@@ iness ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem buil@@ t around on@@ line cri@@ me .
On@@ e example of how these gu@@ ys actually are cap@@ able of mon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing their op@@ er@@ ations : we go and have a look at the p@@ ag@@ es of IN@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L and sear@@ ch for wanted per@@ s@@ ons .
"We find gu@@ ys like B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ und@@ in , or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally from S@@ we@@ d@@ en , and his par@@ tn@@ er in cri@@ me , also li@@ st@@ ed on the IN@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L wanted p@@ ag@@ es , Mr@@ . S@@ ha@@ il@@ es@@ h@@ k@@ u@@ ma@@ r J@@ a@@ in , a U.@@ S@@ . ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ."
"Th@@ ese gu@@ ys were r@@ un@@ ning an op@@ er@@ ation called I.@@ M.@@ U@@ . , a cy@@ b@@ er@@ cri@@ me op@@ er@@ ation through which they ne@@ t@@ ted mil@@ li@@ ons ."
They are bot@@ h right now on the ru@@ n .
No@@ body kno@@ ws where they are .
"@@ U.@@ S@@ . off@@ ici@@ als , just a cou@@ ple of we@@ e@@ ks ago , f@@ ro@@ ze a S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t be@@ l@@ on@@ ging to Mr@@ . J@@ a@@ in , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 14@@ .@@ 9 million U.@@ S@@ . doll@@ ars on it ."
So the am@@ oun@@ t of money on@@ line cri@@ me gener@@ ates is si@@ g@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ant .
And that means that the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als can actually a@@ ff@@ or@@ d to inv@@ est into their at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks .
"We know that on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are h@@ ir@@ ing pro@@ gra@@ mm@@ ers , h@@ ir@@ ing te@@ st@@ ing people , te@@ st@@ ing their co@@ de , ha@@ ving bac@@ k-@@ end sy@@ st@@ ems with S@@ Q@@ L dat@@ ab@@ as@@ es ."
And they can a@@ ff@@ or@@ d to w@@ at@@ ch how we work — like how sec@@ ur@@ ity people work — and try to work their way around any sec@@ ur@@ ity pre@@ ca@@ u@@ tions we can buil@@ d .
They also use the g@@ lob@@ al nat@@ ure of In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t to their ad@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ age .
"I mean , the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t is inter@@ na@@ tional ."
That &apos;s why we call it the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t .
"And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happen@@ ing in the on@@ line world , here &apos;s a vi@@ de@@ o buil@@ t by Cl@@ ari@@ fi@@ ed Ne@@ t@@ wor@@ ks , which ill@@ u@@ str@@ ates how one sing@@ le m@@ al@@ w@@ are fami@@ ly is able to mo@@ ve around the world ."
"This op@@ er@@ ation , beli@@ ev@@ ed to be or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally from E@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ a , mo@@ ves around from one country to another as so@@ on as the we@@ bs@@ ite is tri@@ ed to sh@@ ut down ."
So you just can &apos;t sh@@ ut these gu@@ ys down .
"They will sw@@ it@@ ch from one country to another , from one ju@@ ri@@ s@@ di@@ c@@ tion to another — mo@@ ving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ab@@ ility to g@@ lob@@ ally poli@@ ce op@@ er@@ ations like this ."
So the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t is as if some@@ one would have gi@@ ven f@@ ree plan@@ e tic@@ ke@@ ts to all the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als of the world .
"Now , cri@@ min@@ als who w@@ er@@ en &apos;t cap@@ able of re@@ ach@@ ing us before can re@@ ach us ."
So how do you actually go around fin@@ ding on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als ?
How do you actually tr@@ ack them down ?
L@@ et me give you an example .
What we have here is one exp@@ lo@@ it fi@@ le .
"H@@ ere , I &apos;m looking at the H@@ e@@ x d@@ um@@ p of an ima@@ ge fi@@ le , which con@@ ta@@ ins an exp@@ lo@@ it ."
"And that bas@@ ically means , if you &apos;re trying to vi@@ e@@ w this ima@@ ge fi@@ le on your W@@ in@@ do@@ ws compu@@ ter , it actually ta@@ kes over your compu@@ ter and r@@ un@@ s co@@ de ."
"Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this ima@@ ge fi@@ le — well there &apos;s the ima@@ ge he@@ ad@@ er , and there the ac@@ tu@@ al co@@ de of the at@@ t@@ ack star@@ ts ."
"And that co@@ de has been en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted , so let &apos;s d@@ ec@@ r@@ yp@@ t it ."
It has been en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted with X@@ O@@ R f@@ un@@ c@@ tion 9@@ 7 .
"You just have to believe me , it is , it is ."
And we can go here and actually start d@@ ec@@ r@@ yp@@ ting it .
W@@ ell the y@@ el@@ low part of the co@@ de is now d@@ ec@@ r@@ yp@@ ted .
"And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ."
But just ke@@ ep star@@ ing at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a We@@ b ad@@ dre@@ s@@ s : uni@@ on@@ see@@ k@@ .@@ co@@ m / d / i@@ oo@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you vi@@ e@@ w this ima@@ ge on your compu@@ ter it actually is going to do@@ wn@@ lo@@ ad and ru@@ n that pro@@ gra@@ m .
And that &apos;s a bac@@ k@@ do@@ or which will take over your compu@@ ter .
"But even more interest@@ ing@@ ly , if we cont@@ in@@ ue d@@ ec@@ r@@ yp@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous str@@ ing , which sa@@ ys O@@ 6@@ 00@@ K@@ O@@ 78@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
That co@@ de is there under@@ ne@@ ath the en@@ cr@@ yp@@ tion as some sort of a si@@ gn@@ at@@ ure .
It &apos;s not used for any@@ thing .
"And I was looking at that , trying to fi@@ g@@ ure out what it means ."
So ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly I G@@ oo@@ gl@@ ed for it .
I got z@@ er@@ o h@@ its ; w@@ as@@ n &apos;t there .
So I sp@@ o@@ ke with the gu@@ ys at the la@@ b .
"And we have a cou@@ ple of R@@ us@@ si@@ an gu@@ ys in our l@@ ab@@ s , and one of them m@@ en@@ tion@@ ed , well , it en@@ ds in R@@ U@@ S like R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
And 7@@ 8 is the city co@@ de for the city of St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ b@@ ur@@ g .
"F@@ or example , you can find it from some ph@@ one numb@@ ers and ca@@ r li@@ cen@@ se pl@@ ates and stu@@ ff like that ."
"So I went looking for cont@@ ac@@ ts in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ b@@ ur@@ g , and through a long ro@@ ad , we ev@@ en@@ tually found this one par@@ tic@@ ular we@@ bs@@ ite ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s this R@@ us@@ si@@ an gu@@ y who &apos;s been op@@ er@@ ating on@@ line for a number of years who r@@ un@@ s his own we@@ bs@@ ite , and he r@@ un@@ s a b@@ lo@@ g und@@ er the p@@ op@@ ular Li@@ ve J@@ our@@ n@@ al ."
"And on this b@@ lo@@ g , he b@@ lo@@ gs about his life , about his life in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ b@@ ur@@ g — he &apos;s in his ear@@ ly 20@@ s — about his c@@ at , about his g@@ ir@@ l@@ fri@@ end ."
And he dri@@ ves a very n@@ ice ca@@ r .
"In fact , this gu@@ y dri@@ ves a M@@ er@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ B@@ en@@ z S@@ 60@@ 0 V@@ 1@@ 2 with a si@@ x-@@ lit@@ er en@@ gine with more than 40@@ 0 h@@ or@@ se@@ power ."
Now that &apos;s a n@@ ice ca@@ r for a 20@@ -@@ something ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old k@@ id in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ b@@ ur@@ g .
How do I know about this ca@@ r ?
Because he b@@ lo@@ gg@@ ed about the ca@@ r .
He actually had a ca@@ r ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent .
"In do@@ wn@@ to@@ wn St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ b@@ ur@@ g , he actually cr@@ as@@ h@@ ed his ca@@ r into another ca@@ r ."
And he put b@@ lo@@ gg@@ ed ima@@ ges about the ca@@ r ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent — that &apos;s his M@@ er@@ ce@@ des — right here is the L@@ ad@@ a S@@ am@@ ar@@ a he cr@@ as@@ h@@ ed into .
And you can actually see that the li@@ cen@@ se pl@@ ate of the S@@ am@@ ar@@ a en@@ ds in 78@@ R@@ U@@ S .
"And if you actually take a look at the sc@@ en@@ e pic@@ ture , you can see that the pl@@ ate of the M@@ er@@ ce@@ des is O@@ 6@@ 00@@ K@@ O@@ 78@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
"Now I &apos;m not a la@@ wy@@ er , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I re@@ st my ca@@ se . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happen@@ s when on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are ca@@ u@@ ght ?"
W@@ ell in most ca@@ ses it never ge@@ ts this f@@ ar .
"The v@@ ast ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the on@@ line cri@@ me ca@@ ses , we don &apos;t even know which cont@@ in@@ ent the at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks are coming from ."
"And even if we are able to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als , quite of@@ ten there is no out@@ come ."
"The lo@@ cal poli@@ ce don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence , or for some reas@@ on we can &apos;t take them down ."
I w@@ ish it would be e@@ as@@ i@@ er ; un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely it is@@ n &apos;t .
But things are also chan@@ ging at a very r@@ ap@@ id p@@ ace .
You &apos;ve all he@@ ard about things like S@@ tu@@ x@@ ne@@ t .
So if you look at what S@@ tu@@ x@@ ne@@ t did is that it in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted these .
"That &apos;s a Si@@ em@@ en@@ s S@@ 7-@@ 40@@ 0 P@@ L@@ C , pro@@ gra@@ m@@ ma@@ ble logi@@ c &#9@@ 1@@ ; cont@@ ro@@ ll@@ er &#9@@ 3@@ ; ."
And this is what r@@ un@@ s our in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture .
This is what r@@ un@@ s everything around us .
"P@@ L@@ C &apos;s , these small bo@@ x@@ es which have no dis@@ pl@@ ay , no ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard , which are pro@@ gra@@ mm@@ ed , are put in place , and they do their jo@@ b ."
"F@@ or example , the el@@ ev@@ at@@ ors in this buil@@ ding most li@@ ke@@ ly are cont@@ ro@@ ll@@ ed by one of these ."
"And when S@@ tu@@ x@@ ne@@ t in@@ f@@ ects one of these , that &apos;s a ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution on the k@@ in@@ ds of ri@@ s@@ ks we have to wor@@ ry about ."
Because everything around us is being ru@@ n by these .
"I mean , we have cri@@ tical in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture ."
"You go to any fac@@ t@@ ory , any power pl@@ ant , any ch@@ em@@ i@@ cal pl@@ ant , any food pro@@ c@@ ess@@ ing pl@@ ant , you look around — everything is being ru@@ n by compu@@ ters ."
E@@ very@@ thing is being ru@@ n by compu@@ ters .
E@@ very@@ thing is re@@ li@@ ant on these compu@@ ters working .
"We have become very re@@ li@@ ant on In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t , on bas@@ ic things like elec@@ tri@@ city , ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly , on compu@@ ters working ."
And this really is something which cre@@ ates comple@@ tely new proble@@ ms for us .
We m@@ ust have some way of cont@@ in@@ u@@ ing to work even if compu@@ ters fa@@ il .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So pre@@ par@@ ed@@ n@@ ess means that we can do stu@@ ff even when the things we take for gr@@ an@@ ted ar@@ en &apos;t there .
"It &apos;s actually very bas@@ ic stu@@ ff — thinking about cont@@ in@@ u@@ ity , thinking about bac@@ k@@ up@@ s , thinking about the things that actually mat@@ ter ."
Now I to@@ ld you — ( Laughter ) I love the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t . I do .
Th@@ in@@ k about all the ser@@ v@@ ic@@ es we have on@@ line .
"Th@@ in@@ k about if they are ta@@ k@@ en away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reas@@ on or another ."
"I see be@@ au@@ ty in the future of the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t , but I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we might not see that ."
I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we are r@@ un@@ ning into proble@@ ms because of on@@ line cri@@ me .
On@@ line cri@@ me is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;ve sp@@ ent my life de@@ f@@ en@@ ding the N@@ et , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fi@@ ght on@@ line cri@@ me , we are r@@ un@@ ning a ri@@ s@@ k of l@@ os@@ ing it all ."
"We have to do this g@@ lob@@ ally , and we have to do it right now ."
"Wh@@ at we need is more g@@ lob@@ al , inter@@ na@@ tional la@@ w en@@ for@@ c@@ ement work to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ al g@@ an@@ gs — these organ@@ iz@@ ed g@@ an@@ gs that are making mil@@ li@@ ons out of their at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks ."
That &apos;s much more important than r@@ un@@ ning an@@ ti@@ -@@ vir@@ us@@ es or r@@ un@@ ning fi@@ re@@ w@@ all@@ s .
"Wh@@ at actually mat@@ ters is actually fin@@ ding the people be@@ h@@ ind these at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks , and even more import@@ an@@ tly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this on@@ line world of cri@@ me , but ha@@ ven &apos;t ye@@ t done it ."
"We have to find the people with the sk@@ ill@@ s , but with@@ out the opp@@ ort@@ uni@@ ties and give them the opp@@ ort@@ uni@@ ties to use their sk@@ ill@@ s for good ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is chan@@ ging with really re@@ mar@@ k@@ able spe@@ ed .
"If you look at the ch@@ art at the to@@ p here , you &apos;ll see that in 20@@ 2@@ 5 , these G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s proj@@ ec@@ tions su@@ gg@@ est that the Ch@@ in@@ ese econom@@ y will be al@@ most the same si@@ ze as the Am@@ eri@@ can econom@@ y ."
"And if you look at the ch@@ art for 20@@ 5@@ 0 , it &apos;s proj@@ ec@@ ted that the Ch@@ in@@ ese econom@@ y will be tw@@ ice the si@@ ze of the Am@@ eri@@ can econom@@ y , and the In@@ di@@ an econom@@ y will be al@@ most the same si@@ ze as the Am@@ eri@@ can econom@@ y ."
And we should be@@ ar in m@@ ind here that these proj@@ ec@@ tions were d@@ ra@@ wn up before the W@@ est@@ er@@ n fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al cri@@ s@@ is .
"@@ A cou@@ ple of we@@ e@@ ks ago , I was looking at the l@@ at@@ est proj@@ ec@@ tion by B@@ N@@ P P@@ ari@@ b@@ as for when Ch@@ in@@ a will have a lar@@ ger econom@@ y than the Un@@ ited St@@ ates ."
G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s proj@@ ec@@ ted 20@@ 2@@ 7 .
The pos@@ t-@@ cri@@ s@@ is proj@@ ec@@ tion is 20@@ 2@@ 0 .
That &apos;s just a de@@ ca@@ de away .
Ch@@ in@@ a is going to change the world in two f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al re@@ spec@@ ts .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s a hu@@ ge develop@@ ing country with a p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation of 1.@@ 3 bil@@ lion people , which has been gro@@ w@@ ing for over 3@@ 0 years at around 10 percent a year ."
"And with@@ in a de@@ ca@@ de , it will have the lar@@ g@@ est econom@@ y in the world ."
"N@@ ever before in the mo@@ der@@ n er@@ a has the lar@@ g@@ est econom@@ y in the world been that of a develop@@ ing country , ra@@ ther than a develop@@ ed country ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , for the first time in the mo@@ der@@ n er@@ a , the d@@ om@@ in@@ ant country in the world — which I think is what Ch@@ in@@ a will become — will be not from the W@@ est and from very , very different ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tional ro@@ ots ."
"Now , I know it &apos;s a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion in the W@@ est that as coun@@ tries mo@@ der@@ n@@ iz@@ e , they also we@@ st@@ er@@ n@@ iz@@ e ."
This is an ill@@ us@@ i@@ on .
"It &apos;s an as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion that mo@@ der@@ n@@ ity is a produc@@ t si@@ mp@@ ly of com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , mar@@ ke@@ ts and technology ."
It is not . It is also sh@@ ap@@ ed e@@ qu@@ ally by hi@@ story and cul@@ ture .
"@@ Ch@@ in@@ a is not like the W@@ est , and it will not become like the W@@ est ."
It will re@@ ma@@ in in very f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al re@@ spec@@ ts very different .
"Now the big question here is ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly , how do we make sense of Ch@@ in@@ a ?"
How do we try to understand what Ch@@ in@@ a is ?
"And the problem we have in the W@@ est at the mom@@ ent , by and lar@@ ge , is that the con@@ v@@ en@@ tional ap@@ pro@@ ach is that we understand it really in W@@ est@@ er@@ n ter@@ ms , using W@@ est@@ er@@ n ide@@ as ."
We can &apos;t .
"Now I want to off@@ er you three buil@@ ding b@@ lo@@ c@@ ks for trying to understand what Ch@@ in@@ a is like , just as a be@@ gin@@ ning ."
The first is this : that Ch@@ in@@ a is not really a na@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate .
"O@@ k@@ ay , it &apos;s called it@@ self a na@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate for the last h@@ und@@ red years , but every@@ one who kno@@ ws any@@ thing about Ch@@ in@@ a kno@@ ws it &apos;s a lot ol@@ der than this ."
This was what Ch@@ in@@ a loo@@ ked like with the v@@ ic@@ t@@ ory of the Q@@ in D@@ y@@ na@@ st@@ y in 2@@ 2@@ 1 B.@@ C@@ . at the end of the war@@ r@@ ing@@ -@@ st@@ ate per@@ i@@ od — the b@@ ir@@ th of mo@@ der@@ n Ch@@ in@@ a .
And you can see it aga@@ in@@ st the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ar@@ ies of mo@@ der@@ n Ch@@ in@@ a .
"O@@ r im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely af@@ ter@@ w@@ ard , the H@@ an D@@ y@@ na@@ st@@ y , still 2@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And you can see al@@ ready it oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ies most of what we now know as E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n Ch@@ in@@ a , which is where the v@@ ast ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of Ch@@ in@@ ese li@@ ved then and live now ."
"Now what is ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary about this is , what gi@@ ves Ch@@ in@@ a its sense of being Ch@@ in@@ a , what gi@@ ves the Ch@@ in@@ ese the sense of what it is to be Ch@@ in@@ ese , comes not from the last h@@ und@@ red years , not from the na@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate per@@ i@@ od , which is what happened in the W@@ est , but from the per@@ i@@ od , if you like , of the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate ."
"I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of cu@@ st@@ om@@ s like an@@ ce@@ str@@ al wor@@ shi@@ p , of a very di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tive no@@ tion of the st@@ ate , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , a very di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tive no@@ tion of the fami@@ ly , soci@@ al re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ ps like gu@@ an@@ x@@ i , C@@ on@@ f@@ uc@@ i@@ an val@@ u@@ es and so on ."
Th@@ ese are all things that come from the per@@ i@@ od of the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate .
"In other wor@@ ds , Ch@@ in@@ a , un@@ like the W@@ est@@ er@@ n st@@ ates and most coun@@ tries in the world , is sh@@ ap@@ ed by its sense of ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , its ex@@ i@@ st@@ ence as a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate , ra@@ ther than as a na@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate ."
"And there &apos;s one other thing to ad@@ d to this , and that is this : O@@ f course we know Ch@@ in@@ a &apos;s big , hu@@ ge , de@@ mo@@ grap@@ h@@ ically and ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ically , with a p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation of 1.@@ 3 bil@@ lion people ."
"Wh@@ at we of@@ ten ar@@ en &apos;t really aw@@ are of is the fact that Ch@@ in@@ a is ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly di@@ ver@@ se and very pl@@ ur@@ al@@ is@@ tic , and in many ways very d@@ ec@@ en@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed ."
"You can &apos;t ru@@ n a place on this sc@@ ale si@@ mp@@ ly from Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing , even th@@ ough we think this to be the ca@@ se ."
It &apos;s never been the ca@@ se .
"So this is Ch@@ in@@ a , a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate , ra@@ ther than a na@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate ."
And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think it has all s@@ or@@ ts of pro@@ found imp@@ li@@ ca@@ tions ."
I &apos;ll give you two qu@@ ic@@ k ones .
"The first is that the most important poli@@ tical val@@ ue for the Ch@@ in@@ ese is unity , is the ma@@ in@@ ten@@ ance of Ch@@ in@@ ese ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation ."
"You know , 2@@ ,000 years ago , Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e : bre@@ ak@@ down — the f@@ ra@@ gm@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of the H@@ o@@ ly R@@ om@@ an E@@ mp@@ ir@@ e ."
"It di@@ vi@@ ded , and it &apos;s re@@ ma@@ in@@ ed di@@ vi@@ ded ever s@@ in@@ ce ."
"@@ Ch@@ in@@ a , over the same time per@@ i@@ od , went in ex@@ ac@@ tly the op@@ pos@@ ite di@@ rec@@ tion , very pa@@ in@@ ful@@ ly h@@ ol@@ ding this hu@@ ge ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate , together ."
"The second is maybe more pr@@ os@@ a@@ ic , which is H@@ ong K@@ ong ."
D@@ o you re@@ memb@@ er the h@@ an@@ do@@ ver of H@@ ong K@@ ong by Br@@ it@@ a@@ in to Ch@@ in@@ a in 19@@ 9@@ 7 ?
You may re@@ memb@@ er what the Ch@@ in@@ ese con@@ sti@@ tu@@ tional pro@@ pos@@ i@@ tion was .
"O@@ n@@ e country , two sy@@ st@@ ems ."
And I &apos;ll l@@ ay a w@@ ag@@ er that b@@ ar@@ ely any@@ one in the W@@ est beli@@ ev@@ ed them .
&quot; &quot; W@@ in@@ d@@ ow dre@@ ss@@ ing .
"When Ch@@ in@@ a ge@@ ts its h@@ ands on H@@ ong K@@ ong , that w@@ on &apos;t be the ca@@ se . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ir@@ te@@ en years on , the poli@@ tical and le@@ g@@ al system in H@@ ong K@@ ong is as different now as it was in 19@@ 9@@ 7 ."
We were wr@@ ong . Wh@@ y were we wr@@ ong ?
"We were wr@@ ong because we thought , nat@@ ur@@ ally enough , in na@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate ways ."
"Th@@ in@@ k of G@@ er@@ man uni@@ fi@@ cation , 19@@ 9@@ 0 ."
What happened ?
"Well , bas@@ ically the E@@ ast was sw@@ al@@ low@@ ed by the W@@ est ."
"O@@ n@@ e n@@ ation , one system ."
That is the na@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate m@@ ent@@ ality .
"But you can &apos;t ru@@ n a country like Ch@@ in@@ a , a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate , on the bas@@ is of one ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , one system ."
It doesn &apos;t work .
"So actually the resp@@ on@@ se of Ch@@ in@@ a to the question of H@@ ong K@@ ong — as it will be to the question of Ta@@ i@@ w@@ an — was a nat@@ ur@@ al resp@@ on@@ se : one ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , many sy@@ st@@ ems ."
L@@ et me off@@ er you another buil@@ ding b@@ lo@@ c@@ k to try and understand Ch@@ in@@ a — maybe not sort of a com@@ for@@ t@@ able one .
"The Ch@@ in@@ ese have a very , very different con@@ cep@@ tion of r@@ ace to most other coun@@ tries ."
"D@@ o you know , of the 1.@@ 3 bil@@ lion Ch@@ in@@ ese , over 9@@ 0 percent of them think they be@@ long to the same r@@ ace , the H@@ an ?"
"Now , this is comple@@ tely different from the world &apos;s &#9@@ 1@@ ; other &#9@@ 3@@ ; most p@@ op@@ ul@@ ous coun@@ tries ."
"I@@ n@@ di@@ a , the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , In@@ d@@ on@@ es@@ i@@ a , B@@ ra@@ z@@ il — all of them are m@@ ul@@ ti@@ r@@ ac@@ i@@ al ."
The Ch@@ in@@ ese don &apos;t feel like that .
Ch@@ in@@ a is only m@@ ul@@ ti@@ r@@ ac@@ i@@ al really at the mar@@ gin@@ s .
"So the question is , why ?"
"Well the reas@@ on , I think , ess@@ enti@@ ally is , again , back to the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate ."
"@@ A hi@@ story of at le@@ ast 2@@ ,000 years , a hi@@ story of con@@ qu@@ est , oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ation , ab@@ s@@ or@@ p@@ tion , as@@ si@@ mil@@ ation and so on , l@@ ed to the pro@@ cess by which , over time , this no@@ tion of the H@@ an em@@ er@@ ged — of course , n@@ ur@@ tu@@ red by a gro@@ w@@ ing and very pow@@ er@@ ful sense of cul@@ tur@@ al id@@ enti@@ ty ."
"Now the great ad@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ age of this hi@@ stor@@ i@@ cal experi@@ ence has been that , with@@ out the H@@ an , Ch@@ in@@ a could never have hel@@ d together ."
The H@@ an id@@ enti@@ ty has been the c@@ ement which has hel@@ d this country together .
The great di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ age of it is that the H@@ an have a very we@@ a@@ k con@@ cep@@ tion of cul@@ tur@@ al differ@@ ence .
"They really believe in their own su@@ per@@ i@@ or@@ ity , and they are dis@@ re@@ spec@@ t@@ ful of those who are not ."
"H@@ ence their at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , for example , to the U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur@@ s and to the Ti@@ be@@ t@@ ans ."
"O@@ r let me give you my th@@ ir@@ d buil@@ ding b@@ lo@@ c@@ k , the Ch@@ in@@ ese st@@ ate ."
Now the re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p between the st@@ ate and soci@@ e@@ ty in Ch@@ in@@ a is very different from that in the W@@ est .
Now we in the W@@ est over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing@@ ly see@@ m to think — in these d@@ ays at le@@ ast — that the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ac@@ y of the st@@ ate is a f@@ un@@ c@@ tion of de@@ mo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y .
The problem with this pro@@ pos@@ i@@ tion is that the Ch@@ in@@ ese st@@ ate en@@ jo@@ ys more le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ac@@ y and more au@@ th@@ or@@ ity am@@ on@@ g@@ st the Ch@@ in@@ ese than is tr@@ ue with any W@@ est@@ er@@ n st@@ ate .
"And the reas@@ on for this is because — well , there are two reas@@ ons , I think ."
"And it &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly got no@@ thing to do with de@@ mo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y , because in our ter@@ ms the Ch@@ in@@ ese cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly don &apos;t have a de@@ mo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y ."
"And the reas@@ on for this is , fir@@ st@@ ly , because the st@@ ate in Ch@@ in@@ a is gi@@ ven a very sp@@ eci@@ al — it en@@ jo@@ ys a very sp@@ eci@@ al si@@ g@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ance as the re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tive , the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment and the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an of Ch@@ in@@ ese ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , of the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate ."
This is as cl@@ ose as Ch@@ in@@ a ge@@ ts to a kind of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al ro@@ le .
"And the second reas@@ on is because , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as in Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e and N@@ or@@ th Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a , the st@@ ate &apos;s power is cont@@ in@@ u@@ ous@@ ly ch@@ all@@ en@@ ged — I mean in the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an tra@@ di@@ tion , hi@@ stor@@ ically aga@@ in@@ st the ch@@ ur@@ ch , aga@@ in@@ st other sec@@ t@@ ors of the ari@@ st@@ o@@ cr@@ ac@@ y , aga@@ in@@ st m@@ er@@ chan@@ ts and so on — for 1@@ ,000 years , the power of the Ch@@ in@@ ese st@@ ate has not been ch@@ all@@ en@@ ged ."
It &apos;s had no s@@ eri@@ ous ri@@ v@@ als .
So you can see that the way in which power has been con@@ struc@@ ted in Ch@@ in@@ a is very different from our experi@@ ence in W@@ est@@ er@@ n hi@@ story .
"The res@@ ult , by the way , is that the Ch@@ in@@ ese have a very different vi@@ e@@ w of the st@@ ate ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as we t@@ end to vi@@ e@@ w it as an in@@ tr@@ u@@ der , a str@@ an@@ ger , cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly an org@@ an wh@@ ose pow@@ ers need to be li@@ m@@ ited or de@@ fin@@ ed and con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ ed , the Ch@@ in@@ ese don &apos;t see the st@@ ate like that at all ."
"The Ch@@ in@@ ese vi@@ e@@ w the st@@ ate as an in@@ tim@@ ate — not just as an in@@ tim@@ ate actually , as a memb@@ er of the fami@@ ly — not just in fact as a memb@@ er of the fami@@ ly , but as the he@@ ad of the fami@@ ly , the p@@ at@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch of the fami@@ ly ."
"This is the Ch@@ in@@ ese vi@@ e@@ w of the st@@ ate — very , very different to our@@ s ."
It &apos;s em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in soci@@ e@@ ty in a different kind of way to what is the ca@@ se in the W@@ est .
"And I would su@@ gg@@ est to you that actually what we are de@@ al@@ ing with here , in the Ch@@ in@@ ese cont@@ ex@@ t , is a new kind of par@@ a@@ di@@ g@@ m , which is different from any@@ thing we &apos;ve had to think about in the p@@ ast ."
K@@ now that Ch@@ in@@ a beli@@ ev@@ es in the mar@@ k@@ et and the st@@ ate .
"I mean , Ad@@ am S@@ m@@ ith , al@@ ready wr@@ iting in the l@@ ate 18@@ th c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y , said , &quot; &quot; The Ch@@ in@@ ese mar@@ k@@ et is lar@@ ger and more develop@@ ed and more s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted than any@@ thing in Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e . &quot; &quot; And , ap@@ art from the Ma@@ o per@@ i@@ od , that has re@@ ma@@ in@@ ed more or less the ca@@ se ever s@@ in@@ ce ."
But this is com@@ b@@ in@@ ed with an ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly str@@ ong and u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous st@@ ate .
The st@@ ate is every@@ where in Ch@@ in@@ a .
"I mean , it &apos;s le@@ ad@@ ing fir@@ ms — many of them are still publi@@ c@@ ly ow@@ ned ."
"P@@ ri@@ v@@ ate fir@@ ms , h@@ ow@@ ever lar@@ ge they are , like L@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ o , de@@ p@@ end in many ways on st@@ ate p@@ at@@ r@@ on@@ age ."
T@@ ar@@ ge@@ ts for the econom@@ y and so on are se@@ t by the st@@ ate .
"And the st@@ ate , of course , its au@@ th@@ or@@ ity f@@ low@@ s into l@@ ots of other are@@ as — as we are fami@@ li@@ ar with — with something like the on@@ e-@@ chil@@ d poli@@ cy ."
"M@@ o@@ re@@ over , this is a very old st@@ ate tra@@ di@@ tion , a very old tra@@ di@@ tion of st@@ at@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft ."
"I mean , if you want an ill@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ tion of this , the G@@ re@@ at W@@ all is one ."
"But this is another , this is the Gr@@ and C@@ an@@ al , which was con@@ struc@@ ted in the first in@@ st@@ ance in the fi@@ f@@ th c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y B.@@ C@@ ."
and was fin@@ ally comple@@ ted in the se@@ v@@ en@@ th c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y A.@@ D@@ .
"It went for 1,@@ 11@@ 4 mil@@ es , l@@ in@@ king Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing with H@@ an@@ gz@@ h@@ ou and Sh@@ an@@ g@@ ha@@ i ."
"So there &apos;s a long hi@@ story of ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary st@@ ate in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ tur@@ al proj@@ ects in Ch@@ in@@ a , which I su@@ pp@@ ose hel@@ ps us to ex@@ pla@@ in what we see today , which is something like the Th@@ ree G@@ org@@ es D@@ am and many other ex@@ pres@@ si@@ ons of st@@ ate com@@ pe@@ t@@ ence with@@ in Ch@@ in@@ a ."
"So there we have three buil@@ ding b@@ lo@@ c@@ ks for trying to understand the differ@@ ence that is Ch@@ in@@ a — the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ ate , the no@@ tion of r@@ ace and the nat@@ ure of the st@@ ate and its re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p to soci@@ e@@ ty ."
"And ye@@ t we still in@@ si@@ st , by and lar@@ ge , in thinking that we can understand Ch@@ in@@ a by si@@ mp@@ ly d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing on W@@ est@@ er@@ n experi@@ ence , looking at it through W@@ est@@ er@@ n ey@@ es , using W@@ est@@ er@@ n con@@ cep@@ ts ."
I@@ f you want to know why we un@@ er@@ r@@ ing@@ ly see@@ m to get Ch@@ in@@ a wr@@ ong — our pre@@ di@@ c@@ tions about what &apos;s going to happ@@ en to Ch@@ in@@ a are in@@ cor@@ rec@@ t — this is the reas@@ on .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , I think , I have to say that I think at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de to@@ war@@ ds Ch@@ in@@ a is that of a kind of little W@@ est@@ er@@ n@@ er m@@ ent@@ ality ."
It &apos;s kind of ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant .
"It &apos;s ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant in the sense that we think that we are best , and ther@@ ef@@ ore we have the uni@@ ver@@ s@@ al me@@ as@@ ure ."
"And secon@@ d@@ ly , it &apos;s ig@@ n@@ or@@ ant ."
We re@@ f@@ use to really ad@@ dre@@ s@@ s the is@@ su@@ e of differ@@ ence .
"You know , there &apos;s a very interesting p@@ as@@ s@@ age in a book by P@@ au@@ l Co@@ h@@ en , the Am@@ eri@@ can hi@@ stor@@ i@@ an ."
And P@@ au@@ l Co@@ h@@ en ar@@ gu@@ es that the W@@ est thin@@ ks of it@@ self as prob@@ ably the most c@@ os@@ m@@ op@@ ol@@ it@@ an of all cul@@ tu@@ res .
But it &apos;s not .
"In many ways , it &apos;s the most par@@ o@@ ch@@ i@@ al , because for 20@@ 0 years , the W@@ est has been so d@@ om@@ in@@ ant in the world that it &apos;s not really nee@@ ded to understand other cul@@ tu@@ res , other ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ations ."
"@@ Because , at the end of the day , it could , if nec@@ ess@@ ary by for@@ ce , get its own way ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as those cul@@ tu@@ res — vir@@ tually the re@@ st of the world , in fact , which have been in a f@@ ar we@@ ak@@ er pos@@ i@@ tion , vi@@ s-@@ a@@ -@@ v@@ is the W@@ est — have been ther@@ e@@ by for@@ c@@ ed to understand the W@@ est , because of the W@@ est &apos;s pres@@ ence in those soci@@ e@@ ties ."
"And ther@@ ef@@ ore , they are , as a res@@ ult , more c@@ os@@ m@@ op@@ ol@@ it@@ an in many ways than the W@@ est ."
"I mean , take the question of E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a : J@@ ap@@ an , K@@ o@@ re@@ a , Ch@@ in@@ a , et@@ c . — a th@@ ir@@ d of the world &apos;s p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation li@@ ves there ."
Now the lar@@ g@@ est econom@@ ic re@@ gi@@ on in the world .
"And I &apos;ll tell you now , that E@@ ast A@@ si@@ an@@ ers , people from E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a , are f@@ ar more kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge@@ able about the W@@ est than the W@@ est is about E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"Now this point is very g@@ er@@ man@@ e , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id , to the pres@@ ent ."
"@@ Because what &apos;s happen@@ ing ? B@@ ack to that ch@@ art at the be@@ gin@@ ning , the G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s ch@@ art ."
"Wh@@ at is happen@@ ing is that , very r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly in hi@@ stor@@ i@@ cal ter@@ ms , the world is being dri@@ ven and sh@@ ap@@ ed , not by the old develop@@ ed coun@@ tries , but by the develop@@ ing world ."
"We &apos;ve se@@ en this in ter@@ ms of the G@@ 2@@ 0 us@@ ur@@ p@@ ing very r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly the pos@@ i@@ tion of the G@@ 7 , or the G@@ 8 ."
And there are two con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces of this .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the W@@ est is r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly l@@ os@@ ing its in@@ fl@@ u@@ ence in the world ."
"There was a d@@ ra@@ ma@@ tic ill@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ tion of this actually a year ago — C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en , cli@@ m@@ ate change con@@ f@@ er@@ ence ."
Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e was not at the fin@@ al ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating t@@ able .
Wh@@ en did that last happ@@ en ?
I would w@@ ag@@ er it was prob@@ ably about 20@@ 0 years ago .
And that is what is going to happ@@ en in the future .
"And the second imp@@ li@@ cation is that the world will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably , as a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence , become incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly un@@ fami@@ li@@ ar to us , because it &apos;ll be sh@@ ap@@ ed by cul@@ tu@@ res and experi@@ en@@ ces and hi@@ stor@@ ies that we are not really fami@@ li@@ ar with , or con@@ ver@@ s@@ ant with ."
"And at last , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id — take Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e ; Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a is s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly different — but Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans by and lar@@ ge , I have to say , are ig@@ n@@ or@@ ant , are un@@ aw@@ are about the way the world is chan@@ ging ."
"S@@ ome people — I &apos;ve got an En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h fri@@ end in Ch@@ in@@ a , and he said , &quot; &quot; The cont@@ in@@ ent is s@@ le@@ ep@@ wal@@ king into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on . &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , maybe that &apos;s tr@@ ue , maybe that &apos;s an ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ation ."
But there &apos;s another problem which go@@ es al@@ ong with this — that Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e is incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly out of t@@ ou@@ ch with the world — and that is a sort of l@@ oss of a sense of the future .
"I mean , Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e on@@ ce , of course , on@@ ce comm@@ an@@ ded the future in its con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence ."
"T@@ a@@ ke the 19@@ th c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y , for example ."
"But this , al@@ as , is no l@@ on@@ ger tr@@ ue ."
"If you want to feel the future , if you want to ta@@ st@@ e the future , try Ch@@ in@@ a — there &apos;s old C@@ on@@ f@@ uc@@ i@@ us ."
This is a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation the li@@ kes of which you &apos;ve never se@@ en before .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation .
This is the new &#9@@ 1@@ ; Wu@@ ha@@ n &#9@@ 3@@ ; ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation for the high@@ -@@ spe@@ ed tra@@ ins .
Ch@@ in@@ a al@@ ready has a bi@@ gg@@ er ne@@ t@@ work than any other country in the world and will so@@ on have more than all the re@@ st of the world put together .
"O@@ r take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tri@@ ed out sh@@ ort@@ ly in a su@@ b@@ ur@@ b of Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing ."
"H@@ ere you have a me@@ g@@ ab@@ us , on the u@@ pp@@ er d@@ ec@@ k car@@ ri@@ es about 2@@ ,000 people ."
"It tra@@ vel@@ s on ra@@ il@@ s down a su@@ b@@ ur@@ b@@ an ro@@ ad , and the c@@ ars tra@@ vel under@@ ne@@ ath it ."
And it does spe@@ e@@ ds of up to about 10@@ 0 mil@@ es an h@@ our .
"Now this is the way things are going to mo@@ ve , because Ch@@ in@@ a has a very sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c problem , which is different from Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e and different from the Un@@ ited St@@ ates : Ch@@ in@@ a has hu@@ ge numb@@ ers of people and no space ."
"So this is a sol@@ ution to a s@@ it@@ u@@ ation where Ch@@ in@@ a &apos;s going to have many , many , many ci@@ ties over 2@@ 0 million people ."
"O@@ k@@ ay , so how would I like to fin@@ ish ?"
"Well , what should our at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de be to@@ war@@ ds this world that we see very r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly develop@@ ing before us ?"
I think there will be good things about it and there will be b@@ ad things about it .
"But I want to ar@@ gu@@ e , ab@@ o@@ ve all , a bi@@ g-@@ pic@@ ture pos@@ i@@ tive for this world ."
"F@@ or 20@@ 0 years , the world was ess@@ enti@@ ally gover@@ ned by a f@@ ra@@ g@@ ment of the human p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation ."
That &apos;s what Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e and N@@ or@@ th Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted .
"The ar@@ ri@@ v@@ al of coun@@ tries like Ch@@ in@@ a and In@@ di@@ a — between them 3@@ 8 percent of the world &apos;s p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation — and o@@ th@@ ers like In@@ d@@ on@@ es@@ i@@ a and B@@ ra@@ z@@ il and so on , re@@ pres@@ ent the most important sing@@ le act of de@@ mo@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ z@@ ation in the last 20@@ 0 years ."
"C@@ i@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ations and cul@@ tu@@ res , which had been ig@@ no@@ red , which had no vo@@ ice , which were not li@@ st@@ en@@ ed to , which were not kno@@ wn about , will have a different sort of re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tion in this world ."
"A@@ s hum@@ an@@ i@@ sts , we m@@ ust w@@ el@@ come , su@@ re@@ ly , this tran@@ s@@ formation , and we will have to lear@@ n about these ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ations ."
"This big shi@@ p here was the one sa@@ il@@ ed in by Zh@@ en@@ g He in the ear@@ ly 15@@ th c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y on his great vo@@ y@@ ag@@ es around the S@@ ou@@ th Ch@@ in@@ a Se@@ a , the E@@ ast Ch@@ in@@ a Se@@ a and ac@@ r@@ oss the In@@ di@@ an O@@ ce@@ an to E@@ ast Afri@@ c@@ a ."

I &apos;m here today to start a re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution .
"Now before you get up in ar@@ ms , or you bre@@ a@@ k into s@@ ong , or you pic@@ k a fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite col@@ or , I want to de@@ f@@ ine what I mean by re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution ."
"B@@ y re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution , I mean a dr@@ as@@ tic and f@@ ar@@ -@@ re@@ ach@@ ing change in the way we think and be@@ have — the way we think and the way we be@@ have ."
"Now why , S@@ te@@ ve , why do we need a re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution ?"
We need a re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution because things ar@@ en &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
And that ma@@ kes me really sa@@ d because I &apos;m s@@ ic@@ k and ti@@ red of things not working .
"You know , I &apos;m s@@ ic@@ k and ti@@ red of us not li@@ ving up to our p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al ."
I &apos;m s@@ ic@@ k and ti@@ red of us being last .
"And we are last place in so many things — for example , soci@@ al fac@@ t@@ ors ."
We &apos;re last place in Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e in in@@ no@@ v@@ ation .
"There we are right at the end , right at the bot@@ to@@ m , last place as a cul@@ ture that doesn &apos;t val@@ ue in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ."
"We &apos;re last place in heal@@ th c@@ are , and that &apos;s important for a sense of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ."
"And there we are , not just last in the E.@@ U@@ . , we &apos;re last in Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e , at the very bot@@ to@@ m ."

"We &apos;re the sa@@ dd@@ est place on E@@ ar@@ th , re@@ la@@ tive to G@@ D@@ P p@@ er cap@@ it@@ a — the sa@@ dd@@ est place on E@@ ar@@ th ."

How did this happ@@ en ?
L@@ et &apos;s be pos@@ i@@ tive now . We &apos;re going to get pos@@ i@@ tive . How did this happ@@ en ?
I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be dr@@ as@@ tic to some of you — because we are h@@ an@@ di@@ c@@ app@@ ing our@@ selves .
We &apos;re h@@ ol@@ ding our@@ selves back because we don &apos;t val@@ ue pl@@ ay .

"B@@ ab@@ ies pl@@ ay , ki@@ ds pl@@ ay , ad@@ ul@@ ts pl@@ ay ."
We don &apos;t val@@ ue pl@@ ay .
"In fact , we de@@ val@@ ue pl@@ ay ."
And we de@@ val@@ ue it in three are@@ as .
L@@ et &apos;s go back to the same three are@@ as .
So@@ ci@@ al : 4@@ 5 years of what ?
"O@@ f comm@@ un@@ is@@ m — of val@@ u@@ ing the soci@@ e@@ ty and the st@@ ate over the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al and s@@ qu@@ as@@ h@@ ing , in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently , cre@@ a@@ tiv@@ ity , in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al sel@@ f-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion and in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ."

T@@ o be s@@ eri@@ ous .

I have been to@@ ld by b@@ ab@@ as and dy@@ a@@ do@@ s that we sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t let our ki@@ ds pl@@ ay so much because life is s@@ eri@@ ous and we need to tra@@ in them for the s@@ eri@@ ous@@ n@@ ess of life .
We have a s@@ eri@@ ous me@@ me r@@ un@@ ning through .
It &apos;s a soci@@ al gen@@ e r@@ un@@ ning through us .

It &apos;s 4@@ 5 years of it that &apos;s cre@@ ated what I call the &quot; &quot; b@@ ab@@ a fac@@ t@@ or . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it wor@@ ks .

But then what happen@@ s in ste@@ p three ?
I want to go back to work because I need to f@@ ur@@ ther my car@@ e@@ er or I just want to go have co@@ ff@@ e@@ es .
I &apos;m going to give be@@ b@@ k@@ o to b@@ ab@@ a .
But we need to re@@ memb@@ er that b@@ ab@@ a &apos;s been in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted by the s@@ eri@@ ous me@@ me for 4@@ 5 years .

"S@@ he p@@ as@@ ses that vir@@ us on to b@@ ab@@ y , and it ta@@ kes a really , really , really long time — as the re@@ d@@ w@@ ood tre@@ es — for that s@@ eri@@ ous me@@ me to get out of our op@@ er@@ ating system ."
What happen@@ s then ?
"It go@@ es into e@@ du@@ cation where we have an an@@ ti@@ qu@@ ated e@@ du@@ cation system that has little chan@@ ged for 10@@ 0 years , that val@@ u@@ es r@@ ot@@ e lear@@ ning , me@@ mor@@ iz@@ ation and st@@ and@@ ar@@ di@@ z@@ ation , and de@@ val@@ u@@ es sel@@ f-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , sel@@ f-@@ ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation , ques@@ tion@@ ing , cre@@ a@@ tiv@@ ity and pl@@ ay ."
It &apos;s a c@@ ra@@ p system .

H@@ um@@ ans . We pl@@ ay sp@@ or@@ ts .
"We do it for fu@@ n , or as Ol@@ y@@ mp@@ i@@ ans , or as pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als ."
We pl@@ ay mus@@ i@@ cal in@@ str@@ um@@ ents .
"We d@@ ance , we k@@ is@@ s , we sing , we just go@@ of around ."
We &apos;re desig@@ ned by nat@@ ure to pl@@ ay from b@@ ir@@ th to old age .
We &apos;re desig@@ ned to do that cont@@ in@@ u@@ ous@@ ly — to pl@@ ay and pl@@ ay a lot and not st@@ op pl@@ ay@@ ing .
It is a hu@@ ge b@@ en@@ ef@@ it .
"J@@ ust like there &apos;s b@@ en@@ ef@@ its to an@@ im@@ als , there &apos;s b@@ en@@ ef@@ its to hum@@ ans ."
"F@@ or example , it &apos;s been sh@@ own to sti@@ m@@ ul@@ ate ne@@ ur@@ al gro@@ w@@ th in the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , in the are@@ a where it cont@@ ro@@ l@@ s e@@ mo@@ tions ."
It &apos;s been sh@@ own to pr@@ om@@ ot@@ e pre@@ -@@ fr@@ on@@ t@@ al cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ ment where a lot of co@@ g@@ ni@@ tion is happen@@ ing .
"A@@ s a res@@ ult , what happen@@ s ?"
We devel@@ op more e@@ mo@@ tional mat@@ ur@@ ity if we pl@@ ay more .
We devel@@ op better deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making ab@@ ility if we pl@@ ay more .
Th@@ ese gu@@ ys are fac@@ ts .
"It &apos;s not f@@ ic@@ tion , it &apos;s not story tal@@ es , it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe ; it &apos;s co@@ ld , hard sci@@ ence ."
Th@@ ese are the b@@ en@@ ef@@ its to pl@@ ay .
"It is a gen@@ e@@ tic b@@ ir@@ th@@ right that we have , like wal@@ king or spe@@ a@@ king or see@@ ing ."
"And if we h@@ an@@ di@@ ca@@ p our@@ selves with pl@@ ay , we h@@ an@@ di@@ ca@@ p our@@ selves as if we would with any other b@@ ir@@ th@@ right that we have ."
We ho@@ ld our@@ selves back .
L@@ it@@ tle ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se just for a second : cl@@ ose your ey@@ es and try to ima@@ gine a world with@@ out pl@@ ay .
"I@@ ma@@ gine a world with@@ out the@@ ater , with@@ out the ar@@ ts , with@@ out s@@ ong , with@@ out d@@ an@@ c@@ ing , with@@ out so@@ c@@ c@@ er , with@@ out fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all , with@@ out l@@ aughter ."
What does this world look like ?
It &apos;s pret@@ ty b@@ lea@@ k .
It &apos;s pret@@ ty gl@@ um .
Now ima@@ gine your wor@@ k@@ place .
I@@ s it fu@@ n ? I@@ s it pl@@ ay@@ ful ?
O@@ r maybe the wor@@ k@@ place of your fri@@ en@@ ds — here we &apos;re for@@ w@@ ard thinking .
I@@ s it fu@@ n ? I@@ s it pl@@ ay@@ ful ?
"O@@ r is it c@@ ra@@ p ? I@@ s it au@@ to@@ c@@ ra@@ tic , cont@@ ro@@ ll@@ ing , re@@ stri@@ c@@ tive and un@@ tr@@ u@@ st@@ ing and un@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ing ?"
We have this con@@ cep@@ t that the op@@ pos@@ ite of pl@@ ay is work .
We even feel gu@@ il@@ ty if we &apos;re se@@ en pl@@ ay@@ ing at work .
"@@ &quot; O@@ h , my col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es see me l@@ augh@@ ing . I m@@ ust not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I &apos;ve got to hi@@ de because my b@@ oss might see me ."
He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have ne@@ ws for you : our thinking is bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds .
The op@@ pos@@ ite of pl@@ ay is not work . The op@@ pos@@ ite of pl@@ ay
is de@@ pres@@ sion . It &apos;s de@@ pres@@ sion .
"In fact , pl@@ ay im@@ pro@@ ves our work ."
"J@@ ust like there &apos;s b@@ en@@ ef@@ its for hum@@ ans and an@@ im@@ als , there &apos;s b@@ en@@ ef@@ its for pl@@ ay at work ."
"F@@ or example , it sti@@ m@@ ul@@ ates cre@@ a@@ tiv@@ ity ."
It incre@@ as@@ es our op@@ en@@ n@@ ess to change .
It im@@ pro@@ ves our ab@@ ility to lear@@ n .
"It pro@@ vi@@ des a sense of p@@ ur@@ p@@ ose and ma@@ st@@ er@@ y — two k@@ ey mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tional things that incre@@ ase produc@@ tiv@@ ity , through pl@@ ay ."
"So before you start thinking of pl@@ ay as just not s@@ eri@@ ous , pl@@ ay doesn &apos;t mean fri@@ v@@ ol@@ ous ."
"You know , the pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al a@@ th@@ le@@ te that lo@@ ves s@@ ki@@ ing , he &apos;s s@@ eri@@ ous about it , but he lo@@ ves it ."
"H@@ e &apos;s ha@@ ving fu@@ n , he &apos;s in the gro@@ o@@ ve , he &apos;s in the f@@ low ."
"@@ A do@@ ct@@ or might be s@@ eri@@ ous , but l@@ aughter &apos;s still a great medi@@ c@@ ine ."
Ou@@ r thinking is bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds .
We sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be fe@@ el@@ ing gu@@ il@@ ty .
We should be c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ating pl@@ ay .
Qu@@ ic@@ k example from the cor@@ p@@ or@@ ate world .
"F@@ ed@@ E@@ x , e@@ as@@ y m@@ ot@@ to : people , ser@@ v@@ ice , pro@@ f@@ it ."
"If you tre@@ at your people like people , if you tre@@ at them great , they &apos;re happ@@ i@@ er , they &apos;re ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ed , they have a sense of ma@@ st@@ er@@ y and p@@ ur@@ p@@ ose ."
"Wh@@ at happen@@ s ? They give better ser@@ v@@ ice — not wor@@ se , but better ."
"And when cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers call for ser@@ v@@ ice and they &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with happ@@ y people that can make deci@@ si@@ ons and are ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ed , how do the cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers feel ? They feel great ."
"And what do great cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers do , gre@@ at@@ -@@ fe@@ el@@ ing cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ?"
"They bu@@ y more of your ser@@ v@@ ice and they tell more of their fri@@ en@@ ds , which lea@@ ds to more pro@@ f@@ it ."
"P@@ e@@ ople , ser@@ v@@ ice , pro@@ f@@ it ."
"P@@ l@@ ay incre@@ as@@ es produc@@ tiv@@ ity , not d@@ ec@@ reas@@ es ."
"And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Ge@@ e , that can work for F@@ ed@@ E@@ x out there in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , but it can &apos;t work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ a ."
"N@@ o way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ a , you gu@@ ys . Tw@@ o reas@@ ons ."
"O@@ n@@ e , pl@@ ay is uni@@ ver@@ s@@ al ."
"There &apos;s no@@ thing we@@ ir@@ d about B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ ans that we can &apos;t pl@@ ay , be@@ si@@ des the s@@ eri@@ ous me@@ me that we have to k@@ ic@@ k out ."
"T@@ w@@ o , I &apos;ve tri@@ ed it . I &apos;ve tri@@ ed at S@@ ci@@ ant ."
"When I got there , we had z@@ er@@ o happ@@ y cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ."
No@@ t one cu@@ st@@ om@@ er would re@@ f@@ er us .
I as@@ ked them all .
We had mar@@ gin@@ al pro@@ f@@ it — I did .
"We had mar@@ gin@@ al pro@@ f@@ its , and we had un@@ happ@@ y sta@@ ke@@ h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers ."
"Th@@ r@@ ough some bas@@ ic change , change like im@@ pro@@ ving tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy , change like pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing sel@@ f-@@ di@@ rec@@ tion and coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation , en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation , not au@@ to@@ cr@@ ac@@ y , the things like ha@@ ving a res@@ ul@@ t@@ s-@@ fo@@ c@@ us ."
I don &apos;t c@@ are when you get in in the mor@@ ning . I don &apos;t c@@ are when you lea@@ ve .
I c@@ are that your cu@@ st@@ om@@ er and your te@@ am is happ@@ y and you &apos;re organ@@ iz@@ ed with that .
Wh@@ y do I c@@ are if you get in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ c@@ k ?
B@@ as@@ ically pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing fu@@ n .
"Th@@ r@@ ough pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing fu@@ n and a great en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment , we were able to tran@@ s@@ form S@@ ci@@ ant and , in just three sh@@ ort years — s@@ oun@@ ds like a long time , but change is s@@ low — every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er , from z@@ er@@ o to every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er re@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing us , ab@@ o@@ ve a@@ ver@@ age pro@@ f@@ its for the in@@ du@@ str@@ y and happ@@ y sta@@ ke@@ h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell how do you know they &apos;re happ@@ y ? &quot; &quot; W@@ ell we did w@@ in , every year that we en@@ ter@@ ed , one of the r@@ an@@ k@@ ings for best e@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ er for small bus@@ iness ."
In@@ de@@ p@@ end@@ ent an@@ al@@ ys@@ is from an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous e@@ mp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es on their sur@@ ve@@ ys .
"It does , and it can , work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ a ."
"There &apos;s no@@ thing h@@ ol@@ ding us back , ex@@ cep@@ t our own m@@ ent@@ ality about pl@@ ay ."
So some ste@@ ps that we can take — to fin@@ ish up — how to make this re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution through pl@@ ay .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , you have to believe me ."
"If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something ."
"S@@ econ@@ d of all , if you don &apos;t have the fe@@ el@@ ing of pl@@ ay in you , you need to re@@ disc@@ over pl@@ ay ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever it was that as a k@@ id you used to en@@ jo@@ y , that you en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed only si@@ x mon@@ ths ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion you can &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y , because you feel like you have to be s@@ eri@@ ous , re@@ disc@@ over it ."
I don &apos;t c@@ are if it &apos;s m@@ oun@@ ta@@ in bi@@ king or read@@ ing a book or pl@@ ay@@ ing a ga@@ me .
"@@ Re@@ disc@@ over that because you &apos;re the le@@ ad@@ ers , the in@@ no@@ v@@ ation le@@ ad@@ ers , the thought le@@ ad@@ ers ."
You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the off@@ ice or talk to your fri@@ en@@ ds and ig@@ n@@ ite the fir@@ e of change in the pl@@ ay re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution .
"You gu@@ ys have to , and if you &apos;re not fe@@ el@@ ing it , your col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es , your e@@ mp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , ar@@ en &apos;t going to feel it ."
"You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m going to tr@@ ust you . &quot; &quot; We@@ ir@@ d con@@ cep@@ t : I hi@@ red you ; I should tr@@ ust you ."
"I &apos;m going to let you make deci@@ si@@ ons . I &apos;m going to e@@ mp@@ ow@@ er you , and I &apos;m going to d@@ el@@ eg@@ ate to the low@@ est le@@ vel , ra@@ ther than the to@@ p ."
I &apos;m going to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge con@@ struc@@ tive cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ s@@ m .
I &apos;m going to let you ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge au@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
Because it &apos;s by ch@@ all@@ en@@ ging the way things are always done is that we are able to bre@@ a@@ k out of the r@@ ut that we &apos;re in and create in@@ no@@ va@@ tive sol@@ u@@ tions to proble@@ ms of today .
We &apos;re not always right as le@@ ad@@ ers .
We &apos;re going to er@@ a@@ di@@ ca@@ te fe@@ ar .
Fe@@ ar is the en@@ e@@ my of pl@@ ay .
And we &apos;re going to do things like e@@ li@@ min@@ ate re@@ stri@@ c@@ tions .
"You know what , let them use their mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ one for per@@ s@@ on@@ al call@@ s — he@@ a@@ ven for@@ bi@@ d ."
L@@ et them be on the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t .
L@@ et them be on in@@ st@@ ant m@@ ess@@ en@@ g@@ ers .
L@@ et them take long l@@ un@@ ch@@ es .
L@@ un@@ ch is like the rec@@ ess for work .
"It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you re@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge your brain , you me@@ et your fri@@ en@@ ds , you have a be@@ er , you have some food , you talk , you get some sy@@ n@@ er@@ gy of ide@@ as that maybe you w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t have had before ."
"L@@ et them do it . Gi@@ ve them some f@@ re@@ e@@ do@@ m , and in gener@@ al , let them pl@@ ay . L@@ et them have fu@@ n at the wor@@ k@@ place ."
"We sp@@ end so much of our li@@ ves at the wor@@ k@@ place , and it &apos;s su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed to be , what , a m@@ is@@ er@@ able gr@@ ind , so that 2@@ 0 years from now , we wa@@ ke up and say , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this it ?"
I@@ s that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Un@@ ac@@ cep@@ t@@ able . Ne@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
"( Laughter ) So in su@@ m@@ mar@@ y , we need a dr@@ as@@ tic change in the way we think and be@@ have , but we don &apos;t need a wor@@ k@@ ers &apos; re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution ."
We don &apos;t need a wor@@ k@@ ers &apos; re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution .
What we need is a pl@@ ay@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a pl@@ ay@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a pl@@ ay@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing .
"S@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly , we need to b@@ and together . To@@ day is the start of the u@@ pri@@ sing . But what you need to do is f@@ an the fl@@ am@@ es of the re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution . You need to go and sh@@ are your ide@@ as and your s@@ uc@@ cess stor@@ i@@ es@@ "
"@@ of what wor@@ ked about re@@ in@@ vi@@ g@@ or@@ ating our li@@ ves , our sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s , and our work with pl@@ ay ; about how pl@@ ay pr@@ om@@ ot@@ es a sense of pr@@ om@@ i@@ se and sel@@ f-@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment ; of how pl@@ ay pr@@ om@@ ot@@ es in@@ no@@ v@@ ation and produc@@ tiv@@ ity , and , ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , how pl@@ ay cre@@ ates me@@ an@@ ing ."
"@@ Because we can &apos;t do it al@@ one . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and sh@@ are these ide@@ as on pl@@ ay , we can tran@@ s@@ form B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ a for the better ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by off@@ er@@ ing you a f@@ ree no@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h life h@@ ack , and all it re@@ qu@@ i@@ res of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two min@@ ut@@ es ."
"But before I give it away , I want to as@@ k you to right now do a little au@@ d@@ it of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making y@@ our@@ selves sm@@ all@@ er ?
S@@ om@@ e@@ times we ho@@ ld on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ om@@ e@@ times we sp@@ re@@ ad out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to p@@ ay at@@ ten@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated with body l@@ an@@ gu@@ age , and we &apos;re par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly interest@@ ed in other people &apos;s body l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ."
"You know , we &apos;re interest@@ ed in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ w@@ ard inter@@ ac@@ tion , or a s@@ mi@@ le , or a con@@ te@@ mp@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ w@@ ard w@@ in@@ k , or maybe even something like a h@@ and@@ s@@ ha@@ ke ."
N@@ ar@@ r@@ at@@ or : H@@ ere they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ umb@@ er 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es .
"So ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly when we think about n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or , or body l@@ an@@ gu@@ age — but we call it n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als as soci@@ al sci@@ enti@@ sts — it &apos;s l@@ an@@ gu@@ age , so we think about comm@@ uni@@ cation ."
"When we think about comm@@ uni@@ cation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reas@@ on to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing ju@@ d@@ gm@@ ents and in@@ f@@ er@@ en@@ ces from body l@@ an@@ gu@@ age .
"And those ju@@ d@@ gm@@ ents can pre@@ di@@ c@@ t really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we h@@ ir@@ e or pr@@ om@@ ot@@ e , who we as@@ k out on a d@@ ate ."
"F@@ or example , N@@ al@@ in@@ i A@@ mb@@ ad@@ y , a re@@ sear@@ ch@@ er at Tu@@ f@@ ts U@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , show@@ s that when people w@@ at@@ ch 30@@ -@@ second s@@ oun@@ d@@ less cli@@ ps of real ph@@ ys@@ ici@@ an@@ -@@ pa@@ ti@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their ju@@ d@@ gm@@ ents of the ph@@ ys@@ ici@@ an &apos;s n@@ ic@@ en@@ ess pre@@ di@@ c@@ t whe@@ ther or not that ph@@ ys@@ ici@@ an will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , b@@ ad idea . Ri@@ ght ?"
"We are also in@@ fl@@ u@@ en@@ c@@ ed by our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ gh@@ ts and our fe@@ el@@ ings and our ph@@ y@@ si@@ o@@ logy ."
So what n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I tal@@ king about ?
"I &apos;m a soci@@ al p@@ sy@@ cho@@ lo@@ g@@ ist . I stu@@ dy pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , and I te@@ ach at a com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive bus@@ iness school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interest@@ ed in power d@@ yn@@ am@@ ic@@ s ."
I be@@ came es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally interest@@ ed in n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ si@@ ons of power and d@@ om@@ in@@ ance .
And what are n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ si@@ ons of power and d@@ om@@ in@@ ance ?
"So in the an@@ ima@@ l k@@ ing@@ do@@ m , they are about exp@@ an@@ ding ."
"So you make y@@ our@@ self big , you st@@ re@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re bas@@ ically op@@ en@@ ing up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ en@@ ing up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is kno@@ wn as pri@@ de , J@@ ess@@ ic@@ a Tr@@ ac@@ y has stu@@ di@@ ed ."
We make our@@ selves small .
And this is what happen@@ s when you put together hi@@ gh and low power .
"So if some@@ one is being really pow@@ er@@ ful with us , we t@@ end to make our@@ selves sm@@ all@@ er . We don &apos;t m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing this be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or in the cl@@ as@@ s@@ room , and what do I no@@ ti@@ ce ?"
"When they s@@ it down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ re@@ ad out ."
"You have other people who are vir@@ tually coll@@ ap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I no@@ ti@@ ce a cou@@ ple of things about this .
So women are much more li@@ ke@@ ly to do this kind of thing than m@@ en .
"W@@ om@@ en feel ch@@ r@@ on@@ ically less pow@@ er@@ ful than m@@ en , so this is not sur@@ pri@@ sing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A cl@@ as@@ s@@ room , because par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation coun@@ ts for hal@@ f the gra@@ de ."
So bus@@ iness sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s have been str@@ u@@ gg@@ l@@ ing with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
"So I started to w@@ on@@ der , you know , ok@@ ay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating ."
There &apos;s some e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence that they do .
"So , for example , we s@@ mi@@ le when we feel happ@@ y , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ c@@ ed to s@@ mi@@ le by h@@ ol@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ e@@ th like this , it ma@@ kes us feel happ@@ y ."
So it go@@ es bot@@ h ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ di@@ es , but is it also tr@@ ue that our bo@@ di@@ es change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the ca@@ se of the pow@@ er@@ ful , what am I tal@@ king about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the pow@@ er@@ ful ver@@ su@@ s the pow@@ er@@ less look like ?
"So pow@@ er@@ ful people t@@ end to be , not sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ d@@ ent , more op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to w@@ in even at g@@ am@@ es of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differ@@ en@@ ces . They take more ri@@ s@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to st@@ res@@ s ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power le@@ ad@@ er that &apos;s d@@ om@@ in@@ ant , hi@@ gh on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one , but really st@@ res@@ s re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence , bot@@ h that the body can sh@@ ap@@ e the m@@ ind , at le@@ ast at the fac@@ i@@ al le@@ vel , and also that ro@@ le chan@@ ges can sh@@ ap@@ e the m@@ ind ."
"So what happen@@ s , ok@@ ay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happen@@ s if you do that at a really min@@ ima@@ l le@@ vel , like this t@@ in@@ y man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ation , this t@@ in@@ y inter@@ v@@ en@@ tion ?"
H@@ ere are a cou@@ ple more .
So you can be st@@ an@@ ding or you can be s@@ it@@ ting .
And here are the low@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re f@@ ol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making y@@ our@@ self small ."
"When you &apos;re t@@ ou@@ ch@@ ing your nec@@ k , you &apos;re really prot@@ ec@@ ting y@@ our@@ self ."
So this is what happen@@ s .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole exper@@ im@@ ent .
H@@ ere &apos;s what we find on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"So again , two min@@ ut@@ es , and you get these chan@@ ges ."
H@@ ere &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
"So it se@@ ems that our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als do gover@@ n how we think and feel about our@@ selves , so it &apos;s not just o@@ th@@ ers , but it &apos;s also our@@ selves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ di@@ es change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ a@@ tive s@@ it@@ u@@ ations , like soci@@ al th@@ re@@ at s@@ it@@ u@@ ations ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , this is not about you tal@@ king to other people ."
It &apos;s you tal@@ king to y@@ our@@ self .
So that &apos;s what we want to t@@ est . Ok@@ ay ?
It &apos;s fi@@ ve min@@ ut@@ es long . They are being rec@@ or@@ ded .
"So for fi@@ ve min@@ ut@@ es , no@@ thing , and this is wor@@ se than being h@@ ec@@ kl@@ ed ."
Pe@@ ople h@@ ate this .
"We then have these co@@ d@@ ers look at these t@@ ap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is . They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the con@@ di@@ tions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ ec@@ h .
Th@@ ese k@@ in@@ ds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the eff@@ ect , or medi@@ ating the eff@@ ect ."
"So I said , fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a f@@ ra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an imp@@ os@@ t@@ or .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really b@@ ad ca@@ r ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a ca@@ r , ro@@ ll@@ ed se@@ ver@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the ca@@ r .
"I k@@ new my I@@ Q because I had id@@ enti@@ fi@@ ed with being sm@@ art , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a chil@@ d ."
"So I &apos;m ta@@ k@@ en out of col@@ le@@ ge , I ke@@ ep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish col@@ le@@ ge ."
I am an imp@@ os@@ t@@ or .
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that fe@@ el@@ ing ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , she can fa@@ ke it , she can become it ."
So she had chan@@ ged .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it ."
Fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you become it .
D@@ o it enough un@@ ti@@ l you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ e .
The last thing I &apos;m going to lea@@ ve you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y tw@@ ea@@ ks can le@@ ad to big chan@@ ges .
"So , this is two min@@ ut@@ es ."
"T@@ w@@ o min@@ ut@@ es , two min@@ ut@@ es , two min@@ ut@@ es ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
"D@@ on &apos;t lea@@ ve that s@@ it@@ u@@ ation fe@@ el@@ ing like , o@@ h , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."

"Now , I want to tell you a story about see@@ ing differ@@ ently , and all new per@@ cep@@ tions be@@ g@@ in in the same way ."
They be@@ g@@ in with a question .
The problem with ques@@ tions is they create un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty .
"Now , un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty is a very b@@ ad thing . It &apos;s ev@@ ol@@ u@@ tion@@ ari@@ ly a b@@ ad thing . I@@ f you &apos;re not s@@ ure that &apos;s a pre@@ dat@@ or , it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."

"Y@@ our brain can@@ not de@@ al with the un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty of that information , and it ge@@ ts ill ."
"The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous things you can do , because it ta@@ kes you into un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty ."

"So how can we ever do any@@ thing new ? W@@ ell for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , ev@@ ol@@ ution has gi@@ ven us an an@@ sw@@ er , right ?"
And it en@@ ab@@ l@@ es us to ad@@ dre@@ s@@ s even the most diff@@ ic@@ ult of ques@@ tions . The best ques@@ tions are the ones that create the most un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be tr@@ ue al@@ ready . Ri@@ ght ?
"It &apos;s e@@ as@@ y to as@@ k ques@@ tions about how did life be@@ g@@ in , or what ex@@ ten@@ ds be@@ y@@ on@@ d the uni@@ ver@@ se , but to question what you think to be tr@@ ue al@@ ready is really ste@@ pp@@ ing into that space ."
So what is ev@@ ol@@ ution &apos;s an@@ sw@@ er to the problem of un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty ?
It &apos;s pl@@ ay .
Now pl@@ ay is not si@@ mp@@ ly a pro@@ cess . Ex@@ per@@ ts in pl@@ ay will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
Pl@@ ay is one of the only human en@@ de@@ av@@ ors where un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty is actually c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ated . Un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty is what ma@@ kes pl@@ ay fu@@ n .
"@@ Ri@@ ght ? It &apos;s ad@@ ap@@ t@@ able to change . Ri@@ ght ? It op@@ en@@ s pos@@ si@@ b@@ ility , and it &apos;s co@@ op@@ er@@ a@@ tive . It &apos;s actually how we do our soci@@ al b@@ on@@ ding , and it &apos;s in@@ tr@@ in@@ s@@ ically mo@@ tiv@@ ated . What that means is that we pl@@ ay to pl@@ ay . Pl@@ ay is its own re@@ w@@ ard ."
"Now if you look at these fi@@ ve ways of being , these are the ex@@ act same ways of being you need in or@@ der to be a good sci@@ enti@@ st ."
S@@ ci@@ ence is not de@@ fin@@ ed by the me@@ th@@ od sec@@ tion of a p@@ ap@@ er .
"It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is tr@@ ue for any@@ thing that is cre@@ a@@ tive ."
"So if you ad@@ d r@@ ul@@ es to pl@@ ay , you have a ga@@ me ."
That &apos;s actually what an exper@@ im@@ ent is .
"So ar@@ m@@ ed with these two ide@@ as , that sci@@ ence is a way of being and exper@@ im@@ ents are pl@@ ay , we as@@ ked , can any@@ one become a sci@@ enti@@ st ?"
And who better to as@@ k than 2@@ 5 ei@@ gh@@ t@@ - to 10@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old children ?
"@@ Because they &apos;re exper@@ ts in pl@@ ay . So I took my be@@ e ar@@ en@@ a down to a small school in D@@ ev@@ on , and the ai@@ m of this was to not just get the ki@@ ds to see sci@@ ence differ@@ ently , but , through the pro@@ cess of sci@@ ence , to see the@@ m@@ selves differ@@ ently . Ri@@ ght ?"
The first ste@@ p was to as@@ k a question .
"Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get f@@ und@@ ing for this stu@@ dy because the sci@@ enti@@ sts said small children cou@@ ldn &apos;t make a us@@ e@@ ful con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to sci@@ ence , and the te@@ ach@@ ers said ki@@ ds cou@@ ldn &apos;t do it ."
So we did it any@@ way . Ri@@ ght ? O@@ f course .
"So , here are some of the ques@@ tions . I put them in small pr@@ int so you w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t bo@@ ther read@@ ing it . Po@@ int is that fi@@ ve of the ques@@ tions that the ki@@ ds came up with were actually the bas@@ is of sci@@ ence publi@@ cation the last fi@@ ve to 1@@ 5 years . Ri@@ ght ?"
So they were as@@ king ques@@ tions that were si@@ g@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ant to exper@@ t sci@@ enti@@ sts .
"Now here , I want to sh@@ are the st@@ age with some@@ one quite sp@@ eci@@ al . Ri@@ ght ?"
"S@@ he was one of the y@@ oun@@ g people who was inv@@ ol@@ ved in this stu@@ dy , and she &apos;s now one of the y@@ oun@@ g@@ est publi@@ sh@@ ed sci@@ enti@@ sts in the world . Ri@@ ght ? S@@ he will now , on@@ ce she comes on@@ to st@@ age , will be the y@@ oun@@ g@@ est person to ever spe@@ a@@ k at TE@@ D . Ri@@ ght ?"
"Now , sci@@ ence and as@@ king ques@@ tions is about cou@@ ra@@ ge ."
"Now she is the per@@ s@@ on@@ i@@ fi@@ cation of cou@@ ra@@ ge , because she &apos;s going to st@@ and up here and talk to you all ."
"So A@@ my , would you p@@ le@@ ase come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So A@@ my &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the Bl@@ ac@@ k@@ aw@@ t@@ on Be@@ es P@@ ro@@ j@@ ect , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go a@@ he@@ ad , A@@ my ."
"A@@ my O &apos;@@ T@@ oo@@ le : Thank you , Be@@ a@@ u . We thought that it was e@@ as@@ y to see the l@@ in@@ k between hum@@ ans and ap@@ es in the way that we think , because we look ali@@ ke ."
"But we w@@ on@@ der@@ ed if there &apos;s a pos@@ sible l@@ in@@ k with other an@@ im@@ als . It &apos;d be a@@ ma@@ zing if hum@@ ans and be@@ es thought si@@ mil@@ ar , s@@ in@@ ce they see@@ m so different from us ."
So we as@@ ked if hum@@ ans and be@@ es might sol@@ ve comple@@ x proble@@ ms in the same way .
"@@ Re@@ ally , we wanted to know if be@@ es can also ad@@ ap@@ t the@@ m@@ selves to new s@@ it@@ u@@ ations using pre@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly lear@@ ned r@@ ul@@ es and con@@ di@@ tions . So what if be@@ es can think like us ?"
"Well , it &apos;d be a@@ ma@@ zing , s@@ in@@ ce we &apos;re tal@@ king about an in@@ s@@ ect with only one million brain c@@ ells ."
"But it actually ma@@ kes a lot of sense they should , because be@@ es , like us , can re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e a good f@@ low@@ er re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the time of day , the light , the we@@ a@@ ther , or from any an@@ g@@ le they ap@@ pro@@ ach it from . ( Applause ) B@@ L : So the next ste@@ p was to design an exper@@ im@@ ent , which is a ga@@ me . So the ki@@ ds went off and they desig@@ ned this exper@@ im@@ ent , and so — well , ga@@ me — and so , A@@ my , can you tell us what the ga@@ me was , and the pu@@ zz@@ le that you se@@ t the be@@ es ?"
A@@ O : The pu@@ zz@@ le we came up with was an i@@ f-@@ then ru@@ le .
"We as@@ ked the be@@ es to lear@@ n not just to go to a cer@@ ta@@ in col@@ or , but to a cer@@ ta@@ in col@@ or f@@ low@@ er only when it &apos;s in a cer@@ ta@@ in p@@ at@@ ter@@ n ."
"They were only re@@ war@@ ded if they went to the y@@ el@@ low f@@ low@@ ers if the y@@ el@@ low f@@ low@@ ers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the bl@@ ue , or if the bl@@ ue f@@ low@@ ers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the y@@ el@@ low ."
"Now there &apos;s a number of different r@@ ul@@ es the be@@ es can lear@@ n to sol@@ ve this pu@@ zz@@ le . The interesting question is , which ?"
"Wh@@ at was really ex@@ c@@ iting about this proj@@ ect was we , and Be@@ a@@ u , had no idea whe@@ ther it would work ."
"It was comple@@ tely new , and no one had done it before , in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding ad@@ ul@@ ts . ( Laughter ) B@@ L : In@@ cl@@ u@@ ding the te@@ ach@@ ers , and that was really hard for the te@@ ach@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s e@@ as@@ y for a sci@@ enti@@ st to go in and not have a cl@@ ue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the la@@ b , but for a te@@ ac@@ her not to know what &apos;s going to happ@@ en at the end of the day — so much of the cre@@ d@@ it go@@ es to Da@@ ve S@@ tr@@ u@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ k , who was the coll@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or on this proj@@ ect .

"So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of the stu@@ dy because actually you can re@@ ad about it , but the next ste@@ p is ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ation .

"You just need an opp@@ ort@@ unity . M@@ y opp@@ ort@@ unity came in the form of Be@@ a@@ u , and the Bl@@ ac@@ k@@ aw@@ t@@ on Be@@ e P@@ ro@@ j@@ ect ."
Thank y@@ ou@@ .@@ B@@ L : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the bi@@ gg@@ est proble@@ ms in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tical En@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ent@@ al@@ ist &quot; &quot; — prob@@ ably that &apos;s also a good cho@@ ice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big proble@@ ms in the world ?
"And I m@@ ust say , before I go on , I should as@@ k every one of you to try and get out p@@ en and p@@ ap@@ er because I &apos;m actually going to as@@ k you to help me to look at how we do that ."
So get out your p@@ en and p@@ ap@@ er .
"B@@ ot@@ to@@ m line is , there is a lot of proble@@ ms out there in the world ."
I &apos;m just going to li@@ st some of them .
There are 80@@ 0 million people star@@ ving .
There &apos;s a bil@@ lion people with@@ out c@@ le@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water .
Tw@@ o bil@@ lion people with@@ out s@@ an@@ it@@ ation .
There are se@@ ver@@ al million people d@@ ying of HI@@ V and A@@ ID@@ S .
The li@@ sts go on and on .
There &apos;s two bil@@ li@@ ons of people who will be se@@ ver@@ ely a@@ ff@@ ec@@ ted by cli@@ m@@ ate change — so on .
"There are many , many proble@@ ms out there ."
"In an ide@@ al world , we would sol@@ ve them all , but we don &apos;t ."
We don &apos;t actually sol@@ ve all proble@@ ms .
"And if we do not , the question I think we need to as@@ k our@@ selves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the econom@@ y s@@ es@@ sion — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start as@@ king our@@ selves , which ones should we sol@@ ve first ?"
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to as@@ k you .
"If we had say , 5@@ 0 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars over the next four years to sp@@ end to do good in this world , where should we sp@@ end it ?"
"We id@@ enti@@ fi@@ ed 10 of the bi@@ gg@@ est ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges in the world , and I will just b@@ ri@@ ef@@ ly re@@ ad them : cli@@ m@@ ate change , comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ ble di@@ se@@ as@@ es , con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ ts , e@@ du@@ cation , fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al in@@ st@@ ab@@ ility , gover@@ n@@ ance and cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion , m@@ al@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion and h@@ un@@ ger , p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation mi@@ gra@@ tion , s@@ an@@ it@@ ation and water , and su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es and tra@@ de b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers ."
We believe that these in many ways en@@ comp@@ as@@ s the bi@@ gg@@ est proble@@ ms in the world .
"The ob@@ vi@@ ous question would be to as@@ k , what do you think are the bi@@ gg@@ est things ?"
W@@ here should we start on sol@@ ving these proble@@ ms ?
But that &apos;s a wr@@ ong problem to as@@ k .
That was actually the problem that was as@@ ked in Da@@ vo@@ s in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
"But of course , there &apos;s a problem in as@@ king people to fo@@ c@@ us on proble@@ ms ."
Because we can &apos;t sol@@ ve proble@@ ms .
Su@@ re@@ ly the bi@@ gg@@ est problem we have in the world is that we all di@@ e .
"But we don &apos;t have a technology to sol@@ ve that , right ?"
"So the point is not to pri@@ or@@ i@@ ti@@ ze proble@@ ms , but the point is to pri@@ or@@ i@@ ti@@ ze sol@@ u@@ tions to proble@@ ms ."
And that would be — of course that ge@@ ts a little more comp@@ li@@ ca@@ ted .
T@@ o cli@@ m@@ ate change that would be like K@@ y@@ o@@ to .
"T@@ o comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ ble di@@ se@@ as@@ es , it might be heal@@ th cl@@ in@@ ic@@ s or m@@ os@@ qu@@ i@@ to ne@@ ts ."
"T@@ o con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ ts , it would be U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ke@@ ep@@ ing for@@ ces , and so on ."
"The point that I would like to as@@ k you to try to do , is just in 3@@ 0 secon@@ ds — and I know this is in a sense an imp@@ os@@ sible t@@ as@@ k — wr@@ ite down what you think is prob@@ ably some of the to@@ p pri@@ or@@ i@@ ties ."
"And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where econom@@ ic@@ s ge@@ ts e@@ vi@@ l — to put down what are the things we should not do , first ."
What should be at the bot@@ to@@ m of the li@@ st ?
"P@@ le@@ ase , just take 3@@ 0 secon@@ ds , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s talk to your ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or , and just fi@@ g@@ ure out what should be the to@@ p pri@@ or@@ i@@ ties and the bot@@ to@@ m pri@@ or@@ i@@ ties of the sol@@ u@@ tions that we have to the world &apos;s bi@@ gg@@ est is@@ su@@ es ."
"The a@@ ma@@ zing part of this pro@@ cess — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 1@@ 8 min@@ ut@@ es , I &apos;ve al@@ ready gi@@ ven you quite a su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al am@@ oun@@ t of my time , right ?"
"I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this pro@@ cess , and that &apos;s actually what we did ."
"And I also str@@ on@@ g@@ ly en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , and I &apos;m s@@ ure we &apos;ll also have these disc@@ us@@ si@@ ons af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds , to think about , how do we actually pri@@ or@@ i@@ ti@@ ze ?"
"O@@ f course , you have to as@@ k y@@ our@@ self , why on E@@ ar@@ th was s@@ uch a li@@ st never done before ?"
And one reas@@ on is that pri@@ or@@ i@@ ti@@ z@@ ation is incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly un@@ com@@ for@@ t@@ able .
No@@ body wan@@ ts to do this .
"O@@ f course , every organ@@ iz@@ ation would love to be on the to@@ p of s@@ uch a li@@ st ."
But every organ@@ iz@@ ation would also h@@ ate to be not on the to@@ p of the li@@ st .
"And s@@ in@@ ce there are many more n@@ ot@@ -@@ numb@@ er@@ -@@ one sp@@ ots on the li@@ st than there is number ones , it ma@@ kes per@@ f@@ ect sense not to want to do s@@ uch a li@@ st ."
"We &apos;ve had the U.@@ N@@ . for al@@ most 6@@ 0 years , ye@@ t we &apos;ve never actually made a f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al li@@ st of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?"
"So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not pri@@ or@@ i@@ ti@@ zing — any deci@@ sion is a pri@@ or@@ i@@ ti@@ z@@ ation , so of course we are still pri@@ or@@ i@@ ti@@ zing , if only imp@@ li@@ c@@ it@@ ly — and that &apos;s un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly to be as good as if we actually did the pri@@ or@@ i@@ ti@@ z@@ ation , and went in and tal@@ ked about it ."
"So what I &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a s@@ it@@ u@@ ation when we &apos;ve had a m@@ en@@ u of cho@@ ic@@ es ."
"There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the pri@@ ces , no@@ r the si@@ z@@ es ."
We have not had an idea .
"I@@ ma@@ gine going into a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant and getting this big m@@ en@@ u c@@ ard , but you have no idea what the pri@@ ce is ."
"You know , you have a p@@ iz@@ z@@ a ; you &apos;ve no idea what the pri@@ ce is ."
"It could be at one doll@@ ar ; it could be 1@@ ,000 doll@@ ars ."
"It could be a fam@@ il@@ y-@@ si@@ ze p@@ iz@@ z@@ a ; it could be a very in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al@@ -@@ si@@ ze p@@ iz@@ z@@ a , right ?"
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en C@@ on@@ sen@@ su@@ s is really trying to do — to try to put pri@@ ces on these is@@ su@@ es .
"And so bas@@ ically , this has been the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en C@@ on@@ sen@@ su@@ s &apos; pro@@ cess ."
"We got 3@@ 0 of the world &apos;s best econom@@ i@@ sts , three in each are@@ a ."
So we have three of world &apos;s to@@ p econom@@ i@@ sts wr@@ ite about cli@@ m@@ ate change .
What can we do ? What will be the c@@ ost and what will be the b@@ en@@ ef@@ it of that ?
Li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se in comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ ble di@@ se@@ as@@ es .
"Th@@ ree of the world &apos;s to@@ p exper@@ ts sa@@ ying , what can we do ?"
What would be the pri@@ ce ?
"Wh@@ at should we do about it , and what will be the out@@ come ?"
And so on .
"Th@@ en we had some of the world &apos;s to@@ p econom@@ i@@ sts , ei@@ ght of the world &apos;s to@@ p econom@@ i@@ sts , in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding three No@@ be@@ l L@@ au@@ re@@ ates , me@@ et in C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en in M@@ ay 2@@ 00@@ 4 ."
We called them the &quot; &quot; dre@@ am te@@ am . &quot; &quot; The C@@ am@@ b@@ ri@@ d@@ ge U@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity pre@@ f@@ ects deci@@ ded to call them the Re@@ al M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d of econom@@ ic@@ s .
"That wor@@ ks very well in Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here ."
And what they bas@@ ically did was come out with a pri@@ or@@ i@@ ti@@ z@@ ed li@@ st .
"And then you as@@ k , why econom@@ i@@ sts ?"
"And of course , I &apos;m very happ@@ y you as@@ ked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question ."
"The point is , of course , if you want to know about m@@ al@@ ari@@ a , you as@@ k a m@@ al@@ ari@@ a exper@@ t ."
"If you want to know about cli@@ m@@ ate , you as@@ k a cli@@ mat@@ o@@ lo@@ g@@ ist ."
"But if you want to know which of the two you should de@@ al with first , you can &apos;t as@@ k ei@@ ther of them , because that &apos;s not what they do ."
That is what econom@@ i@@ sts do .
They pri@@ or@@ i@@ ti@@ ze .
"They make that in some ways dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing t@@ as@@ k of sa@@ ying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds ?"
"So this is the li@@ st , and this is the one I &apos;d like to sh@@ are with you ."
"O@@ f course , you can also see it on the we@@ bs@@ ite , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m s@@ ure , as the day go@@ es on ."
"They bas@@ ically came up with a li@@ st where they said there were b@@ ad proj@@ ects — bas@@ ically , proj@@ ects where if you inv@@ est a doll@@ ar , you get less than a doll@@ ar back ."
"Th@@ en there &apos;s fa@@ ir proj@@ ects , good proj@@ ects and very good proj@@ ects ."
"And of course , it &apos;s the very good proj@@ ects we should start doing ."
I &apos;m going to go from bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds so that we end up with the best proj@@ ects .
Th@@ ese were the b@@ ad proj@@ ects .
A@@ s you might see the bot@@ to@@ m of the li@@ st was cli@@ m@@ ate change .
"This off@@ en@@ ds a lot of people , and that &apos;s prob@@ ably one of the things where people will say I sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t come back , ei@@ ther ."
"And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really cu@@ ri@@ ous ."
Wh@@ y is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s prob@@ ably one of the things that we &apos;ll dis@@ ag@@ ree with on the li@@ st that you wr@@ ot@@ e down .
The reas@@ on why they came up with sa@@ ying that K@@ y@@ o@@ to — or doing something more than K@@ y@@ o@@ to — is a b@@ ad de@@ al is si@@ mp@@ ly because it &apos;s very in@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent .
It &apos;s not sa@@ ying that g@@ lob@@ al war@@ m@@ ing is not happen@@ ing .
It &apos;s not sa@@ ying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
"But it &apos;s sa@@ ying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very hi@@ gh c@@ ost ."
"Wh@@ at they bas@@ ically show us , the a@@ ver@@ age of all m@@ ac@@ ro@@ econom@@ ic mo@@ d@@ el@@ s , is that K@@ y@@ o@@ to , if every@@ one ag@@ re@@ ed , would c@@ ost about 15@@ 0 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars a year ."
That &apos;s a su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al am@@ oun@@ t of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the g@@ lob@@ al develop@@ ment a@@ id that we give the Th@@ ir@@ d W@@ or@@ ld every year .
Y@@ et it would do very little good .
A@@ ll mo@@ d@@ el@@ s show it will pos@@ t@@ p@@ one war@@ m@@ ing for about si@@ x years in 2@@ 10@@ 0 .
So the gu@@ y in B@@ an@@ gl@@ ad@@ es@@ h who ge@@ ts a f@@ loo@@ d in 2@@ 10@@ 0 can wa@@ it un@@ ti@@ l 2@@ 10@@ 6 .
"Wh@@ ich is a little good , but not very much good ."
"So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve sp@@ ent a lot of money doing a little good ."
"And just to give you a sense of re@@ f@@ er@@ ence , the U.@@ N@@ . actually es@@ tim@@ ate that for hal@@ f that am@@ oun@@ t , for about 7@@ 5 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars a year , we could sol@@ ve all ma@@ j@@ or bas@@ ic proble@@ ms in the world ."
"We could give c@@ le@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water , s@@ an@@ it@@ ation , bas@@ ic heal@@ th@@ c@@ are and e@@ du@@ cation to every sing@@ le human being on the plan@@ et ."
"So we have to as@@ k our@@ selves , do we want to sp@@ end tw@@ ice the am@@ oun@@ t on doing very little good ?"
O@@ r hal@@ f the am@@ oun@@ t on doing an a@@ ma@@ zing am@@ oun@@ t of good ?
And that is really why it be@@ comes a b@@ ad proj@@ ect .
"It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t want to do it ."
"But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just si@@ mp@@ ly not our first pri@@ or@@ ity ."
"The fa@@ ir proj@@ ects — no@@ ti@@ ce I &apos;m not going to com@@ ment on all these — but comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ ble di@@ se@@ as@@ es , sc@@ ale of bas@@ ic heal@@ th ser@@ v@@ ic@@ es — just made it , si@@ mp@@ ly because , y@@ es , sc@@ ale of bas@@ ic heal@@ th ser@@ v@@ ic@@ es is a great thing ."
"It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very c@@ os@@ tly ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , what it t@@ ells us is su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly we start thinking about bot@@ h si@@ des of the e@@ qu@@ ation ."
"If you look at the good proj@@ ects , a lot of s@@ an@@ it@@ ation and water proj@@ ects came in ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , s@@ an@@ it@@ ation and water is incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly important , but it also c@@ os@@ ts a lot of in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture ."
So I &apos;d like to show you the to@@ p four pri@@ or@@ i@@ ties which should be at le@@ ast the first ones that we de@@ al with when we talk about how we should de@@ al with the proble@@ ms in the world .
The f@@ our@@ th best problem is m@@ al@@ ari@@ a — de@@ al@@ ing with m@@ al@@ ari@@ a .
The in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence of m@@ al@@ ari@@ a is about a cou@@ ple of &#9@@ 1@@ ; million &#9@@ 3@@ ; people get in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted every year .
It might even c@@ ost up to@@ war@@ ds a per@@ c@@ ent@@ age point of G@@ D@@ P every year for a@@ ff@@ ec@@ ted na@@ tions .
"If we in@@ ve@@ st@@ ed about 1@@ 3 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars over the next four years , we could br@@ ing that in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence down to hal@@ f ."
"We could a@@ vo@@ id about 5@@ 00@@ ,000 people d@@ ying , but per@@ h@@ ap@@ s more import@@ an@@ tly , we could a@@ vo@@ id about a &#9@@ 1@@ ; million &#9@@ 3@@ ; people getting in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted every year ."
"We would si@@ g@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ an@@ tly incre@@ ase their ab@@ ility to de@@ al with many of the other proble@@ ms that they have to de@@ al with — of course , in the long ru@@ n , also to de@@ al with g@@ lob@@ al war@@ m@@ ing ."
This th@@ ir@@ d best one was f@@ ree tra@@ de .
"B@@ as@@ ically , the mo@@ de@@ l show@@ ed that if we could get f@@ ree tra@@ de , and es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally c@@ ut su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es in the U.@@ S@@ . and Eu@@ ro@@ p@@ e , we could bas@@ ically en@@ li@@ ven the g@@ lob@@ al econom@@ y to an a@@ st@@ oun@@ ding number of about 2,@@ 40@@ 0 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars a year , hal@@ f of which would ac@@ c@@ ru@@ e to the Th@@ ir@@ d W@@ or@@ ld ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , the point is to say that we could actually p@@ ul@@ l two to three h@@ und@@ red million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty , very ra@@ di@@ c@@ ally f@@ ast , in about two to fi@@ ve years ."
That would be the th@@ ir@@ d best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to fo@@ c@@ us on m@@ al@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion .
"N@@ o@@ t just m@@ al@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion in gener@@ al , but there &apos;s a very ch@@ ea@@ p way of de@@ al@@ ing with m@@ al@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion , na@@ me@@ ly , the l@@ ack of m@@ ic@@ r@@ on@@ u@@ tri@@ ents ."
"B@@ as@@ ically , about hal@@ f of the world &apos;s p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation is l@@ ac@@ king in ir@@ on , z@@ in@@ c , i@@ o@@ d@@ ine and v@@ it@@ am@@ in A@@ ."
"If we inv@@ est about 1@@ 2 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars , we could make a se@@ v@@ ere in@@ ro@@ ad into that problem ."
That would be the second best in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment that we could do .
And the very best proj@@ ect would be to fo@@ c@@ us on HI@@ V / A@@ ID@@ S .
"B@@ as@@ ically , if we inv@@ est 2@@ 7 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars over the next ei@@ ght years , we could a@@ vo@@ id 2@@ 8 new million ca@@ ses of HI@@ V / A@@ ID@@ S ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , what this does and what it fo@@ c@@ us@@ es on is sa@@ ying there are two very different ways that we can de@@ al with HI@@ V / A@@ ID@@ S ."
On@@ e is tre@@ at@@ ment ; the other one is pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
"And again , in an ide@@ al world , we would do bot@@ h ."
"But in a world where we don &apos;t do ei@@ ther , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at le@@ ast as@@ k our@@ selves where should we inv@@ est first ."
"And tre@@ at@@ ment is much , much more exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve than pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion ."
"So bas@@ ically , what this fo@@ c@@ us@@ es on is sa@@ ying , we can do a lot more by in@@ ve@@ st@@ ing in pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion ."
"B@@ as@@ ically for the am@@ oun@@ t of money that we sp@@ end , we can do X am@@ oun@@ t of good in tre@@ at@@ ment , and 10 times as much good in pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion ."
"So again , what we fo@@ c@@ us on is pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion ra@@ ther than tre@@ at@@ ment , at first r@@ ate ."
What this really does is that it ma@@ kes us think about our pri@@ or@@ i@@ ties .
"I &apos;d like to have you look at your pri@@ or@@ ity li@@ st and say , did you get it right ?"
O@@ r did you get cl@@ ose to what we came up with here ?
"Well , of course , one of the things is cli@@ m@@ ate change again ."
"I find a lot of people find it very , very un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly that we should do that ."
"We should also do cli@@ m@@ ate change , if for no other reas@@ on , si@@ mp@@ ly because it &apos;s s@@ uch a big problem ."
"But of course , we don &apos;t do all proble@@ ms ."
There are many proble@@ ms out there in the world .
"And what I want to make s@@ ure of is , if we actually fo@@ c@@ us on proble@@ ms , that we fo@@ c@@ us on the right ones ."
The ones where we can do a lot of good ra@@ ther than a little good .
"And I think , actually — Th@@ om@@ as S@@ ch@@ ell@@ ing , one of the par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ an@@ ts in the dre@@ am te@@ am , he put it very , very well ."
"O@@ n@@ e of things that people for@@ get , is that in 10@@ 0 years , when we &apos;re tal@@ king about most of the cli@@ m@@ ate change imp@@ ac@@ ts will be , people will be much , much ri@@ ch@@ er ."
E@@ ven the most p@@ es@@ si@@ m@@ is@@ tic imp@@ act sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o@@ s of the U.@@ N@@ .
es@@ tim@@ ate that the a@@ ver@@ age person in the develop@@ ing world in 2@@ 10@@ 0 will be about as ri@@ ch as we are today .
"M@@ uch more li@@ ke@@ ly , they will be two to four times ri@@ ch@@ er than we are ."
"And of course , we &apos;ll be even ri@@ ch@@ er than that ."
"But the point is to say , when we talk about sa@@ ving people , or hel@@ p@@ ing people in B@@ an@@ gl@@ ad@@ es@@ h in 2@@ 10@@ 0 , we &apos;re not tal@@ king about a po@@ or B@@ an@@ gl@@ ad@@ es@@ h@@ i ."
We &apos;re actually tal@@ king about a fa@@ ir@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ ut@@ ch gu@@ y .
"And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to sp@@ end a lot of money hel@@ p@@ ing a little , 10@@ 0 years from now , a fa@@ ir@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ ut@@ ch gu@@ y ?"
"O@@ r do we want to help real po@@ or people , right now , in B@@ an@@ gl@@ ad@@ es@@ h , who really need the help , and wh@@ om we can help very , very ch@@ e@@ ap@@ ly ?"
"O@@ r as S@@ ch@@ ell@@ ing put it , ima@@ gine if you were a ri@@ ch — as you will be — a ri@@ ch Ch@@ in@@ ese , a ri@@ ch Bo@@ li@@ vi@@ an , a ri@@ ch C@@ on@@ go@@ l@@ ese , in 2@@ 10@@ 0 , thinking back on 2@@ 00@@ 5 , and sa@@ ying , &quot; &quot; How o@@ d@@ d that they car@@ ed so much about hel@@ p@@ ing me a little bit through cli@@ m@@ ate change , and car@@ ed so fa@@ ir@@ ly little about hel@@ p@@ ing my gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther and my great gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther , wh@@ om they could have hel@@ p@@ ed so much more , and who nee@@ ded the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our pri@@ or@@ i@@ ties st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght ."
E@@ ven if it doesn &apos;t ac@@ cor@@ d to the ty@@ pi@@ cal way we see this problem .
"O@@ f course , that &apos;s ma@@ in@@ ly because cli@@ m@@ ate change has good pic@@ tu@@ res ."
"We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The D@@ ay Af@@ ter T@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w &quot; &quot; — it loo@@ ks great , right ?"
"It &apos;s a good f@@ il@@ m in the sense that I cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t exp@@ ect E@@ mm@@ er@@ ich to ca@@ st B@@ ra@@ d P@@ it@@ t in his next mo@@ vi@@ e di@@ gg@@ ing l@@ at@@ r@@ in@@ es in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ a or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a mo@@ vi@@ e ."
"So in many ways , I think of the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en C@@ on@@ sen@@ su@@ s and the whole disc@@ us@@ sion of pri@@ or@@ i@@ ties as a de@@ f@@ en@@ se for bor@@ ing proble@@ ms ."
T@@ o make s@@ ure that we re@@ aliz@@ e it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
"It &apos;s not about making things that have the most medi@@ a at@@ ten@@ tion , but it &apos;s about making plac@@ es where we can actually do the most good ."
"The other ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tions , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m some@@ how — or we are some@@ how — pos@@ iting a f@@ al@@ se cho@@ ice ."
"O@@ f course , we should do all things , in an ide@@ al world — I would cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly ag@@ ree ."
"I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t ."
"In 19@@ 7@@ 0 , the develop@@ ed world deci@@ ded we were going to sp@@ end tw@@ ice as much as we did , right now , than in 19@@ 7@@ 0 , on the develop@@ ing world ."
S@@ in@@ ce then our a@@ id has hal@@ ved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the p@@ ath of su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly sol@@ ving all big proble@@ ms .
"L@@ i@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , people are also sa@@ ying , but what about the I@@ ra@@ q w@@ ar ?"
"You know , we sp@@ end 10@@ 0 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars — why don &apos;t we sp@@ end that on doing good in the world ?"
I &apos;m all for that .
"If any one of you gu@@ ys can talk B@@ us@@ h into doing that , that &apos;s f@@ ine ."
"But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 10@@ 0 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars , we still want to sp@@ end that in the best pos@@ sible way , don &apos;t we ?"
So the real is@@ su@@ e here is to get our@@ selves back and think about what are the right pri@@ or@@ i@@ ties .
"I should just m@@ en@@ tion b@@ ri@@ ef@@ ly , is this really the right li@@ st that we got out ?"
"You know , when you as@@ k the world &apos;s best econom@@ i@@ sts , you in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably end up as@@ king old , wh@@ ite Am@@ eri@@ can m@@ en ."
"And they &apos;re not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly , you know , great ways of looking at the enti@@ re world ."
So we actually inv@@ ited 8@@ 0 y@@ oun@@ g people from all over the world to come and sol@@ ve the same problem .
"The only two re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ m@@ ents were that they were stu@@ d@@ ying at the uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , and they sp@@ o@@ ke En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h ."
"The ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of them were , first , from develop@@ ing coun@@ tries ."
"They had all the same mat@@ eri@@ al but they could go va@@ st@@ ly out@@ side the sc@@ op@@ e of disc@@ us@@ sion , and they cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly did , to come up with their own li@@ sts ."
And the sur@@ pri@@ sing thing was that the li@@ st was very si@@ mil@@ ar — with m@@ al@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion and di@@ se@@ as@@ es at the to@@ p and cli@@ m@@ ate change at the bot@@ to@@ m .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
"There &apos;s been many other se@@ min@@ ars and uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity stu@@ d@@ ents , and different things ."
They all come out with very much the same li@@ st .
"And that gi@@ ves me great hop@@ e , really , in sa@@ ying that I do believe that there is a p@@ ath a@@ he@@ ad to get us to start thinking about pri@@ or@@ i@@ ties , and sa@@ ying , what is the important thing in the world ?"
"O@@ f course , in an ide@@ al world , again we &apos;d love to do everything ."
"But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?"
I see the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en C@@ on@@ sen@@ su@@ s as a pro@@ cess .
"We did it in 2@@ 00@@ 4 , and we hop@@ e to as@@ se@@ m@@ ble many more people , getting much better information for 2@@ 00@@ 8 , 20@@ 1@@ 2 ."
Ma@@ p out the right p@@ ath for the world — but also to start thinking about poli@@ tical tri@@ age .
"T@@ o start thinking about sa@@ ying , &quot; &quot; L@@ et &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very hi@@ gh c@@ ost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous am@@ oun@@ t of good , at very low c@@ ost , right now . &quot; &quot; A@@ t the end of the day , you can dis@@ ag@@ ree with the disc@@ us@@ sion of how we actually pri@@ or@@ i@@ ti@@ ze these , but we have to be h@@ on@@ est and fr@@ ank about sa@@ ying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do ."
"If we wor@@ ry too much about some things , we end by not wor@@ r@@ ying about other things ."
"So I hop@@ e this will help us make better pri@@ or@@ i@@ ties , and think about how we better work for the world ."
Thank you .
Ou@@ r world has many su@@ per@@ h@@ er@@ o@@ es .

"And also , they are fam@@ ous now on the st@@ re@@ e@@ ts , on ma@@ s@@ s medi@@ a and soci@@ al ."
"So , the thing is , I pl@@ un@@ ged into this uni@@ ver@@ se and have not st@@ opp@@ ed working s@@ in@@ ce ."
I have pa@@ in@@ ted over 20@@ 0 car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as in many ci@@ ties and have been inv@@ ited to do ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions and tri@@ ps wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de .

And we really are see@@ ing this in very different ter@@ ms from the kind of m@@ app@@ ing and di@@ rec@@ tion s@@ ite that one is used to .
"So , the first thing that you might no@@ ti@@ ce about the m@@ app@@ ing s@@ ite is just the fl@@ u@@ id@@ ity of the z@@ o@@ om@@ ing and the p@@ an@@ ning , which , if you &apos;re fami@@ li@@ ar at all with Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , that &apos;s where it comes from ."

It &apos;s w@@ on@@ der@@ ful .

So this one was ta@@ k@@ en around fi@@ ve .

I would like to kind of z@@ oo@@ m in on the mo@@ on .

"I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : On@@ e is what we have l@@ ost , and two , a way to br@@ ing it back ."
And let me start with this .
"This is my bas@@ el@@ ine : This is the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ r@@ an@@ e@@ an co@@ ast with no f@@ ish , b@@ are ro@@ c@@ k and l@@ ots of se@@ a ur@@ ch@@ ins that like to e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing like this is what I first sa@@ w when I ju@@ mp@@ ed in the water for the first time in the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ r@@ an@@ e@@ an co@@ ast off S@@ pa@@ in .
"Now , if an ali@@ en came to ear@@ th — let &apos;s call him Jo@@ e — what would Jo@@ e see ?"
"If Jo@@ e ju@@ mp@@ ed in a cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f , there are many things the ali@@ en could see ."
"V@@ er@@ y un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly , Jo@@ e would j@@ um@@ p on a pri@@ st@@ ine cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f , a vir@@ g@@ in cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f with l@@ ots of cor@@ al , sh@@ ar@@ ks , c@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ l@@ es , man@@ at@@ e@@ es , grou@@ per@@ s , tur@@ tl@@ es , et@@ c ."
"So , prob@@ ably , what Jo@@ e would see would be in this part , in the gre@@ en@@ ish part of the pic@@ ture ."
"H@@ ere we have the ex@@ tre@@ me with de@@ ad cor@@ als , m@@ ic@@ ro@@ bi@@ al s@@ ou@@ p and j@@ ell@@ y@@ f@@ ish ."
"And where the di@@ ver is , this is prob@@ ably where most of the re@@ ef@@ s of the world are now , with very few cor@@ als , al@@ ga@@ e over@@ gro@@ w@@ ing the cor@@ als , l@@ ots of bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a , and where the lar@@ ge an@@ im@@ als are g@@ one ."
And this is what most mar@@ ine sci@@ enti@@ sts have se@@ en too .
This is their bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what they think is nat@@ ur@@ al because we started mo@@ der@@ n sci@@ ence with sc@@ u@@ b@@ a di@@ ving long after we started de@@ gra@@ ding mar@@ ine ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ ems .
"So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time m@@ ach@@ ine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the p@@ ast to see what the o@@ ce@@ an was like ."
"And let &apos;s start with this time m@@ ach@@ ine , the L@@ ine I@@ sl@@ ands , where we have con@@ duc@@ ted a ser@@ ies of Na@@ tional Ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ c ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions ."
"This se@@ a is an ar@@ ch@@ i@@ p@@ el@@ ago be@@ l@@ on@@ ging to K@@ i@@ ri@@ b@@ at@@ i that sp@@ ans ac@@ r@@ oss the e@@ qu@@ at@@ or and it has se@@ ver@@ al un@@ in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited , un@@ fi@@ sh@@ ed , pri@@ st@@ ine is@@ l@@ ands and a few in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited is@@ l@@ ands ."
"So let &apos;s start with the first one : Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as I@@ sl@@ and , over 5@@ ,000 people ."
"M@@ ost of the re@@ ef@@ s are de@@ ad , most of the cor@@ als are de@@ ad — over@@ gro@@ wn by al@@ ga@@ e — and most of the f@@ ish are sm@@ all@@ er than the p@@ en@@ c@@ il@@ s we use to coun@@ t them ."
We did 25@@ 0 h@@ our@@ s of di@@ ving here in 2@@ 00@@ 5 .
We didn &apos;t see a sing@@ le sh@@ ar@@ k .
This is the place that C@@ ap@@ ta@@ in C@@ oo@@ k disc@@ over@@ ed in 17@@ 7@@ 7 and he des@@ cri@@ b@@ ed a hu@@ ge ab@@ und@@ ance of sh@@ ar@@ ks b@@ iting the ru@@ dd@@ ers and the o@@ ars of their small bo@@ at@@ s wh@@ i@@ le they were going as@@ h@@ ore .
L@@ et &apos;s mo@@ ve the di@@ al a little bit to the p@@ ast .
"F@@ an@@ ning I@@ sl@@ and , 2,@@ 50@@ 0 people ."
The cor@@ als are doing better here . L@@ ots of small f@@ ish .
This is what many di@@ ver@@ s would con@@ si@@ der par@@ a@@ di@@ se .
This is where you can see most of the Fl@@ or@@ id@@ a K@@ e@@ ys Na@@ tional M@@ ar@@ ine S@@ an@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
"And many people think this is really , really be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful , if this is your bas@@ el@@ ine ."
"If we go back to a place like P@@ al@@ my@@ r@@ a A@@ t@@ ol@@ l , where I was with J@@ er@@ e@@ my J@@ ac@@ k@@ son a few years ago , the cor@@ als are doing better and there are sh@@ ar@@ ks ."
You can see sh@@ ar@@ ks in every sing@@ le di@@ ve .
And this is something that is very un@@ us@@ u@@ al in today &apos;s cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s .
"But then , if we shi@@ ft the di@@ al 20@@ 0 , 50@@ 0 years back , then we get to the plac@@ es where the cor@@ als are ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tely heal@@ th@@ y and g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous , form@@ ing spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular struc@@ tu@@ res , and where the pre@@ dat@@ ors are the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous thing , where you see between 2@@ 5 and 5@@ 0 sh@@ ar@@ ks p@@ er di@@ ve ."
What have we lear@@ ned from these plac@@ es ?
This is what we thought was nat@@ ur@@ al .
This is what we call the bi@@ om@@ as@@ s p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id .
"If we get all of the f@@ ish of a cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f together and we@@ i@@ gh them , this is what we would exp@@ ect ."
"M@@ ost of the bi@@ om@@ as@@ s is low on the food c@@ ha@@ in , the h@@ er@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , the par@@ r@@ ot@@ f@@ ish , the sur@@ ge@@ on@@ f@@ ish that e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
"Th@@ en the plan@@ k@@ t@@ on fe@@ ed@@ ers , these little d@@ am@@ sel@@ f@@ ish , the little an@@ im@@ als f@@ lo@@ ating in the water ."
"And then we have a low@@ er bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , and a low@@ er bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of to@@ p he@@ ad , or the sh@@ ar@@ ks , the lar@@ ge s@@ n@@ ap@@ per@@ s , the lar@@ ge grou@@ per@@ s ."
But this is a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence .
This vi@@ e@@ w of the world is a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of ha@@ ving stu@@ di@@ ed de@@ gra@@ ded re@@ ef@@ s .
"When we went to pri@@ st@@ ine re@@ ef@@ s , we re@@ aliz@@ ed that the nat@@ ur@@ al world was up@@ side down ; this p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id was in@@ ver@@ ted ."
"The to@@ p he@@ ad does ac@@ coun@@ t for most of the bi@@ om@@ as@@ s , in some plac@@ es up to 8@@ 5 percent , like K@@ ing@@ man Re@@ e@@ f , which is now prot@@ ec@@ ted ."
"The good ne@@ ws is that , in ad@@ di@@ tion to ha@@ ving more pre@@ dat@@ ors , there &apos;s more of everything ."
The si@@ ze of these bo@@ x@@ es is bi@@ gg@@ er .
"We have more sh@@ ar@@ ks , more bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of s@@ n@@ ap@@ per@@ s , more bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of h@@ er@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , too , like these par@@ ro@@ t f@@ ish that are like mar@@ ine go@@ at@@ s ."
"They c@@ le@@ an the re@@ e@@ f ; everything that gro@@ ws enough to be se@@ en , they e@@ at , and they ke@@ ep the re@@ e@@ f c@@ le@@ an and al@@ low the cor@@ als to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish ."
"N@@ o@@ t only do these plac@@ es — these an@@ ci@@ ent , pri@@ st@@ ine plac@@ es — have l@@ ots of f@@ ish , but they also have other important comp@@ on@@ ents of the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem like the gi@@ ant cl@@ am@@ s ; pa@@ v@@ em@@ ents of gi@@ ant cl@@ am@@ s in the la@@ go@@ ons , up to 2@@ 0 , 2@@ 5 p@@ er s@@ qu@@ are me@@ ter ."

"If we don &apos;t have fi@@ sh@@ ing because these re@@ ef@@ s are prot@@ ec@@ ted by la@@ w or their re@@ m@@ ot@@ en@@ ess , this is great ."
But the water ge@@ ts war@@ m@@ er for too long and the cor@@ als di@@ e .
"So how are these f@@ ish , these pre@@ dat@@ ors going to help ?"
"Well , what we have se@@ en is that in this par@@ tic@@ ular are@@ a d@@ ur@@ ing E@@ l N@@ in@@ o , year &apos; 9@@ 7 , &apos; 9@@ 8 , the water was too war@@ m for too long , and many cor@@ als b@@ le@@ ach@@ ed and many di@@ ed ."
"In Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , where the food we@@ b is really tri@@ mm@@ ed down , where the lar@@ ge an@@ im@@ als are g@@ one , the cor@@ als have not re@@ co@@ ver@@ ed ."
"In F@@ an@@ ning I@@ sl@@ and , the cor@@ als are not re@@ co@@ ver@@ ed ."
But you see here a big t@@ able cor@@ al that di@@ ed and coll@@ ap@@ s@@ ed .
"And the f@@ ish have gra@@ z@@ ed the al@@ ga@@ e , so the tur@@ f of al@@ ga@@ e is a little low@@ er ."
"Th@@ en you go to P@@ al@@ my@@ r@@ a A@@ t@@ ol@@ l that has more bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of h@@ er@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , and the de@@ ad cor@@ als are c@@ le@@ an , and the cor@@ als are coming back ."
"And when you go to the pri@@ st@@ ine side , did this ever b@@ le@@ ach ?"
"Th@@ ese plac@@ es b@@ le@@ ach@@ ed too , but they re@@ co@@ ver@@ ed fa@@ ster ."
"The more int@@ act , the more comple@@ te , &#9@@ 1@@ ; and &#9@@ 3@@ ; the more comple@@ x your food we@@ b , the high@@ er the re@@ si@@ li@@ ence , &#9@@ 1@@ ; and &#9@@ 3@@ ; the more li@@ ke@@ ly that the system is going to re@@ co@@ ver from the sh@@ ort@@ -@@ ter@@ m imp@@ ac@@ ts of war@@ m@@ ing ev@@ ents ."
"And that &apos;s good ne@@ ws , so we need to re@@ co@@ ver that struc@@ ture ."
We need to make s@@ ure that all of the piec@@ es of the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem are there so the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem can ad@@ ap@@ t to the eff@@ ects of g@@ lob@@ al war@@ m@@ ing .
"So if we have to re@@ se@@ t the bas@@ el@@ ine , if we have to p@@ us@@ h the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem back to the left , how can we do it ?"
"Well , there are se@@ ver@@ al ways ."
"O@@ n@@ e very c@@ le@@ ar way is the mar@@ ine prot@@ ec@@ ted are@@ as , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally no@@ -@@ take res@@ er@@ ves that we se@@ t as@@ i@@ de to al@@ low for the re@@ co@@ very for mar@@ ine life ."
And let me go back to that ima@@ ge of the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ r@@ an@@ e@@ an .
This was my bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what I sa@@ w when I was a k@@ id .
"And at the same time I was w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u &apos;s show@@ s on T@@ V , with all this ri@@ ch@@ n@@ ess and ab@@ und@@ ance and di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity ."
"And I thought that this ri@@ ch@@ n@@ ess be@@ l@@ on@@ ged to t@@ ro@@ pi@@ cal se@@ as , and that the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ r@@ an@@ e@@ an was a nat@@ ur@@ ally po@@ or se@@ a ."
"But , little did I know , un@@ ti@@ l I ju@@ mp@@ ed for the first time in a mar@@ ine res@@ er@@ ve ."
"And this is what I sa@@ w , l@@ ots of f@@ ish ."
"A@@ f@@ ter a few years , between fi@@ ve and se@@ ven years , f@@ ish come back , they e@@ at the ur@@ ch@@ ins , and then the al@@ ga@@ e gro@@ w again ."
"So you have this little al@@ g@@ al fo@@ re@@ st , and in the si@@ ze of a l@@ ap@@ to@@ p you can find more than 10@@ 0 spec@@ ies of al@@ ga@@ e , m@@ os@@ tly m@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ ic f@@ it h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of spec@@ ies of little an@@ im@@ als that then fe@@ ed the f@@ ish , so that the system re@@ co@@ ver@@ s ."
"And this par@@ tic@@ ular place , the M@@ ed@@ es I@@ sl@@ ands M@@ ar@@ ine R@@ es@@ er@@ ve , is only 9@@ 4 h@@ ec@@ t@@ ar@@ es , and it br@@ ings 6 million eu@@ ro@@ s to the lo@@ cal econom@@ y , 2@@ 0 times more than fi@@ sh@@ ing , and it re@@ pres@@ ents 8@@ 8 percent of all the t@@ ou@@ ri@@ st re@@ v@@ en@@ ue ."
So these plac@@ es not only help the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem but also help the people who can b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem .
So let me just give you a su@@ m@@ mar@@ y of what no@@ -@@ take res@@ er@@ ves do .
"Th@@ ese plac@@ es , when we prot@@ ect them , if we comp@@ are them to un@@ prot@@ ec@@ ted are@@ as ne@@ ar@@ by , this is what happen@@ s ."
"The number of spec@@ ies incre@@ as@@ es 2@@ 1 percent ; so if you have 1@@ ,000 spec@@ ies you would exp@@ ect 20@@ 0 more in a mar@@ ine res@@ er@@ ve ."
This is very su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al .
"The si@@ ze of organ@@ is@@ ms incre@@ as@@ es a th@@ ir@@ d , so your f@@ ish are now this big ."
"The ab@@ und@@ ance , how many f@@ ish you have p@@ er s@@ qu@@ are me@@ ter , incre@@ as@@ es al@@ most 17@@ 0 percent ."
"And the bi@@ om@@ as@@ s — this is the most spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular change — 4.@@ 5 times gre@@ ater bi@@ om@@ as@@ s on a@@ ver@@ age , just after fi@@ ve to se@@ ven years ."
I@@ n some plac@@ es up to 10 times lar@@ ger bi@@ om@@ as@@ s in@@ side the res@@ er@@ ves .
"So we have all these things in@@ side the res@@ er@@ ve that gro@@ w , and what do they do ?"
They re@@ pro@@ du@@ ce . That &apos;s p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation bi@@ o@@ logy 10@@ 1 .
"If you don &apos;t k@@ ill the f@@ ish , they take a l@@ on@@ ger time to di@@ e , they gro@@ w lar@@ ger and they re@@ pro@@ du@@ ce a lot ."
And same thing for in@@ ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates . This is the example .
"Th@@ ese are eg@@ g ca@@ ses la@@ id by a s@@ na@@ il off the co@@ ast of C@@ hi@@ le , and this is how many eg@@ gs they l@@ ay on the bot@@ to@@ m ."
"O@@ ut@@ side the res@@ er@@ ve , you can@@ not even de@@ t@@ ect this ."
On@@ e point three million eg@@ gs p@@ er s@@ qu@@ are me@@ ter in@@ side the mar@@ ine res@@ er@@ ve where these s@@ na@@ il@@ s are very ab@@ und@@ ant .
"So these organ@@ is@@ ms re@@ pro@@ du@@ ce , the little lar@@ va@@ e ju@@ v@@ en@@ il@@ es sp@@ ill over , they all sp@@ ill over , and then people can b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from them out@@ side too ."
This is in the Ba@@ ha@@ m@@ as : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ p@@ er .
"H@@ u@@ ge ab@@ und@@ ance of grou@@ per@@ s in@@ side the res@@ er@@ ve , and the cl@@ os@@ er you get to the res@@ er@@ ve , the more f@@ ish you have ."
So the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ m@@ en are ca@@ t@@ ch@@ ing more .
You can see where the li@@ m@@ its of the res@@ er@@ ve are because you see the bo@@ at@@ s l@@ in@@ ed up .
"So there is sp@@ ill over ; there are b@@ en@@ ef@@ its be@@ y@@ on@@ d the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ar@@ ies of these res@@ er@@ ves that help people around them , wh@@ i@@ le at the same time the res@@ er@@ ve is prot@@ ec@@ ting the enti@@ re ha@@ b@@ it@@ at . It is buil@@ ding re@@ si@@ li@@ ence ."
So what we have now — or a world with@@ out res@@ er@@ ves — is like a de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ t where we with@@ d@@ ra@@ w all the time and we never make any de@@ pos@@ it .
R@@ es@@ er@@ ves are like sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts .
"We have this pr@@ in@@ ci@@ p@@ al that we don &apos;t t@@ ou@@ ch ; that produc@@ es re@@ tur@@ ns , soci@@ al , econom@@ ic and ec@@ o@@ logi@@ cal ."
"And if we think about the incre@@ ase of bi@@ om@@ as@@ s in@@ side the res@@ er@@ ves , this is like comp@@ ound inter@@ est ."
"T@@ w@@ o ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es , again , of how these res@@ er@@ ves can b@@ en@@ ef@@ it people ."
"This is how much fi@@ sh@@ er@@ m@@ en get every@@ day in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , fi@@ sh@@ ing over a ser@@ ies of years , in a place where there is no prot@@ ec@@ tion ; it &apos;s a f@@ re@@ e-@@ for@@ -@@ all ."
"O@@ n@@ ce the most de@@ gra@@ ding fi@@ sh@@ ing ge@@ ar , se@@ ine ne@@ ts , were re@@ mo@@ ved , the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ m@@ en were ca@@ t@@ ch@@ ing more ."
"If you f@@ ish less , you &apos;re actually ca@@ t@@ ch@@ ing more ."
"But if we ad@@ d the no@@ -@@ take res@@ er@@ ve on to@@ p of that , the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ m@@ en are still making more money by fi@@ sh@@ ing less around an are@@ a that is prot@@ ec@@ ted ."
A@@ no@@ ther example : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ per@@ s in Be@@ li@@ ze in the M@@ es@@ o@@ am@@ eri@@ can Re@@ e@@ f .
"This is grou@@ p@@ er se@@ x , and the grou@@ per@@ s ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate around the ful@@ l mo@@ ons of D@@ ec@@ em@@ b@@ er and J@@ an@@ u@@ ary for a we@@ e@@ k ."
"They used to ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate up to the ten@@ s of thou@@ s@@ ands , 30@@ ,000 grou@@ per@@ s about this big in one h@@ ec@@ t@@ are , in one ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ation ."
"F@@ i@@ sh@@ er@@ m@@ en k@@ new about these things ; they ca@@ u@@ ght them , and they de@@ p@@ le@@ ted them ."
"When I went there for the first time in 2@@ 000 , there were only 3@@ ,000 grou@@ per@@ s left ."
And the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ m@@ en were au@@ th@@ or@@ iz@@ ed to ca@@ t@@ ch 3@@ 0 percent of the enti@@ re sp@@ aw@@ ning p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation every year .
"So we did a si@@ mple an@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and it doesn &apos;t take ro@@ ck@@ et sci@@ ence to fi@@ g@@ ure out that , if you take 3@@ 0 percent every year , your fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y is going to coll@@ ap@@ se very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly ."
"And with the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y , the enti@@ re re@@ produc@@ tive ab@@ ility of the spec@@ ies go@@ es ex@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ t ."
It happened in many plac@@ es around the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an .
"And they would make 4@@ ,000 doll@@ ars p@@ er year , t@@ ot@@ al , for the enti@@ re fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y , se@@ ver@@ al fi@@ sh@@ ing bo@@ at@@ s ."
"Now , if you do an econom@@ ic an@@ al@@ ys@@ is and proj@@ ect what would happ@@ en if the f@@ ish were not c@@ ut , if we br@@ ou@@ ght just 2@@ 0 di@@ ver@@ s one mon@@ th p@@ er year , the re@@ v@@ en@@ ue would be more than 2@@ 0 times high@@ er and that would be su@@ sta@@ in@@ able over time ."
So how much of this do we have ?
"If this is so good , if this is s@@ uch a no@@ -@@ bra@@ in@@ er , how much of this do we have ?"
And you al@@ ready he@@ ard that less than one percent of the o@@ ce@@ an &apos;s prot@@ ec@@ ted .
"We &apos;re getting cl@@ os@@ er to one percent now , th@@ an@@ ks to the prot@@ ec@@ tions of the C@@ ha@@ go@@ s Ar@@ ch@@ i@@ p@@ el@@ ago , and only a fr@@ ac@@ tion of this is ful@@ ly prot@@ ec@@ ted from fi@@ sh@@ ing ."
S@@ ci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c stu@@ di@@ es re@@ comm@@ end that at le@@ ast 2@@ 0 percent of the o@@ ce@@ an should be prot@@ ec@@ ted .
The es@@ tim@@ ated r@@ an@@ ge is between 2@@ 0 and 5@@ 0 percent for a ser@@ ies of go@@ als of bi@@ o@@ di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity and fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y en@@ h@@ an@@ c@@ ement and re@@ si@@ li@@ ence .
"Now , is this pos@@ sible ? Pe@@ ople would as@@ k : How much would that c@@ ost ?"
"Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are p@@ ay@@ ing now to su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ze fi@@ sh@@ ing : 3@@ 5 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars p@@ er year ."
M@@ any of these su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es go to de@@ struc@@ tive fi@@ sh@@ ing pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es .
"Well , there are a cou@@ ple es@@ ti@@ mat@@ es of how much it would c@@ ost to create a ne@@ t@@ work of prot@@ ec@@ ted are@@ as co@@ ver@@ ing 2@@ 0 percent of the o@@ ce@@ an that would be only a fr@@ ac@@ tion of what we are now p@@ ay@@ ing ; the gover@@ n@@ ment h@@ ands out to a fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y that is coll@@ ap@@ sing ."
Pe@@ ople are l@@ os@@ ing their j@@ ob@@ s because the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies are coll@@ ap@@ sing .
A cre@@ ation of a ne@@ t@@ work of res@@ er@@ ves would pro@@ vi@@ de di@@ rec@@ t e@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment for more than a million people pl@@ us all the secon@@ d@@ ary j@@ ob@@ s and all the secon@@ d@@ ary b@@ en@@ ef@@ its .
So how can we do that ?
"If it &apos;s so c@@ le@@ ar that these sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts are good for the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 2@@ 0 , 5@@ 0 percent of the o@@ ce@@ an ?"
And how can we re@@ ach that go@@ al ?
"Well , there are two ways of getting there ."
The tri@@ vi@@ al sol@@ ution is to create really lar@@ ge prot@@ ec@@ ted are@@ as like the C@@ ha@@ go@@ s Ar@@ ch@@ i@@ p@@ el@@ ago .
"The problem is that we can create these lar@@ ge res@@ er@@ ves only in plac@@ es where there are no people , where there is no soci@@ al con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ t , where the poli@@ tical c@@ ost is really low and the econom@@ ic c@@ ost is also low ."
"And a few of us , a few organ@@ iz@@ ations in this room and el@@ se@@ where are working on this ."
"But what about the re@@ st of the co@@ ast of the world , where people live and make a li@@ ving out of fi@@ sh@@ ing ?"
"Well , there are three ma@@ in reas@@ ons why we don &apos;t have ten@@ s of thou@@ s@@ ands of small res@@ er@@ ves : The first one is that people have no idea what mar@@ ine res@@ er@@ ves do , and fi@@ sh@@ er@@ m@@ en t@@ end to be really , really de@@ f@@ en@@ si@@ ve when it comes to re@@ g@@ ul@@ ating or cl@@ os@@ ing an are@@ a , even if it &apos;s small ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , the gover@@ n@@ ance is not right because most co@@ a@@ st@@ al comm@@ uni@@ ties around the world don &apos;t have the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity to mon@@ it@@ or the res@@ our@@ ces to create the res@@ er@@ ve and en@@ for@@ ce it ."
It &apos;s a to@@ p down hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ i@@ cal struc@@ ture where people wa@@ it for gover@@ n@@ ment ag@@ ents to come and this is not eff@@ ec@@ tive . And the gover@@ n@@ ment doesn &apos;t have enough res@@ our@@ ces .
"Wh@@ ich ta@@ kes us to the th@@ ir@@ d reas@@ on , why we don &apos;t have many more res@@ er@@ ves , is that the f@@ und@@ ing mo@@ d@@ el@@ s have been wr@@ ong ."
"N@@ G@@ O@@ s and gover@@ n@@ m@@ ents sp@@ end a lot of time and energy and res@@ our@@ ces in a few small are@@ as , us@@ u@@ ally ."
"So mar@@ ine con@@ ser@@ v@@ ation and co@@ a@@ st@@ al prot@@ ec@@ tion has become a s@@ in@@ k for gover@@ n@@ ment or ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ ic money , and this is not su@@ sta@@ in@@ able ."
So the sol@@ u@@ tions are just fi@@ x@@ ing these three is@@ su@@ es .
"F@@ ir@@ st , we need to devel@@ op a g@@ lob@@ al aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n to in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e lo@@ cal comm@@ uni@@ ties and gover@@ n@@ m@@ ents to create no@@ -@@ take res@@ er@@ ves that are better than what we have now ."
It &apos;s the sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts ver@@ su@@ s the de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ ts with no de@@ pos@@ its .
"S@@ econ@@ d , we need to re@@ design our gover@@ n@@ ance so con@@ ser@@ v@@ ation eff@@ or@@ ts can be d@@ ec@@ en@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed , so con@@ ser@@ v@@ ation eff@@ or@@ ts don &apos;t de@@ p@@ end on work from N@@ G@@ O@@ s or from gover@@ n@@ ment ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es and can be cre@@ ated by the lo@@ cal comm@@ uni@@ ties , like it happen@@ s in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ in@@ es and a few other plac@@ es ."
"And th@@ ir@@ d , and very important , we need to devel@@ op new bus@@ iness mo@@ d@@ el@@ s ."
The ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ y s@@ in@@ k as the only way to create res@@ er@@ ves is not su@@ sta@@ in@@ able .
"We really need to devel@@ op mo@@ d@@ el@@ s , bus@@ iness mo@@ d@@ el@@ s , where co@@ a@@ st@@ al con@@ ser@@ v@@ ation is an in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment , because we al@@ ready know that these mar@@ ine res@@ er@@ ves pro@@ vi@@ de soci@@ al , ec@@ o@@ logi@@ cal and econom@@ ic b@@ en@@ ef@@ its ."
"And I &apos;d like to fin@@ ish with one thought , which is that no one organ@@ iz@@ ation al@@ one is going to sa@@ ve the o@@ ce@@ an ."
"There has been a lot of com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion in the p@@ ast , and we need to devel@@ op a new mo@@ de@@ l of par@@ tn@@ er@@ shi@@ p , tr@@ u@@ ly coll@@ ab@@ or@@ a@@ tive , where we are looking for comple@@ m@@ en@@ ting , not su@@ b@@ sti@@ tu@@ ting ."
The sta@@ kes are just too hi@@ gh to cont@@ in@@ ue the way we are going .
So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Thank you En@@ ri@@ c .
En@@ ri@@ c S@@ al@@ a : Thank you .
C@@ A : That was a ma@@ st@@ er@@ ful jo@@ b of p@@ ul@@ l@@ ing things together .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , your p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id , your in@@ ver@@ ted p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id , show@@ ing 8@@ 5 percent bi@@ om@@ as@@ s in the pre@@ dat@@ ors , that se@@ ems imp@@ os@@ sible ."
How could 8@@ 5 percent sur@@ vi@@ ve on 1@@ 5 percent ?
"E@@ S : W@@ ell , ima@@ gine that you have two ge@@ ars of a w@@ at@@ ch , a big one and a small one ."
"The big one is mo@@ ving very s@@ low@@ ly , and the small one is mo@@ ving f@@ ast ."
That &apos;s bas@@ ically it .
"The an@@ im@@ als at the low@@ er par@@ ts of the food c@@ ha@@ in , they re@@ pro@@ du@@ ce very f@@ ast ; they gro@@ w really f@@ ast ; they pro@@ du@@ ce mil@@ li@@ ons of eg@@ gs ."
"U@@ p there , you have sh@@ ar@@ ks and lar@@ ge f@@ ish that live 2@@ 5 , 3@@ 0 years ."
"They re@@ pro@@ du@@ ce very s@@ low@@ ly ; they have a s@@ low me@@ t@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ s@@ m ; and , bas@@ ically , they just ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in their bi@@ om@@ as@@ s ."
"So , bas@@ ically , the produc@@ tion sur@@ pl@@ us of these gu@@ ys down there is enough to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in this bi@@ om@@ as@@ s that is not mo@@ ving ."
They are like cap@@ ac@@ it@@ ors of the system .
C@@ A : That &apos;s very f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating .
"So , really , our pic@@ ture of a food p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id is just — we have to change that comple@@ tely ."
E@@ S : A@@ t le@@ ast in the se@@ as .
"Wh@@ at we found in cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s is that the in@@ ver@@ ted p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id is the e@@ qu@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the S@@ er@@ en@@ ge@@ t@@ i , with fi@@ ve li@@ ons p@@ er w@@ il@@ de@@ be@@ est ."
"And on l@@ and , this can@@ not work ."
But at le@@ ast on cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s are sy@@ st@@ ems where there is a bot@@ to@@ m comp@@ on@@ ent with struc@@ ture .
We think this is uni@@ ver@@ s@@ al .
But we have started stu@@ d@@ ying pri@@ st@@ ine re@@ ef@@ s only very rec@@ ently .
C@@ A : So the numb@@ ers you pres@@ en@@ ted really are a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing .
You &apos;re sa@@ ying we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding 3@@ 5 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars now on su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es .
It would only c@@ ost 1@@ 6 bil@@ lion to se@@ t up 2@@ 0 percent of the o@@ ce@@ an as mar@@ ine prot@@ ec@@ ted are@@ as that actually give new li@@ ving cho@@ ic@@ es to the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ m@@ en as well .
"If the world was a sm@@ ar@@ ter place , we could sol@@ ve this problem for ne@@ ga@@ tive 1@@ 9 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars ."
We &apos;ve got 1@@ 9 bil@@ lion to sp@@ end on heal@@ th c@@ are or something .
E@@ S : And then we have the under@@ -@@ per@@ form@@ ance of fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies that is 5@@ 0 bil@@ lion doll@@ ars .
"So again , one of the big sol@@ u@@ tions is have the W@@ or@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de Or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation shi@@ f@@ ting the su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es to su@@ sta@@ in@@ able pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es ."
"C@@ A : Ok@@ ay , so there &apos;s a lot of ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es that I &apos;m he@@ ar@@ ing out there about en@@ ding this su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es ma@@ dn@@ ess ."
So th@@ ank you for those numb@@ ers .
The last one &apos;s a per@@ s@@ on@@ al question .
"@@ A lot of the experi@@ ence of people here who &apos;ve been in the o@@ ce@@ ans for a long time has just been see@@ ing this de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation , the plac@@ es they sa@@ w that were be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful getting wor@@ se , de@@ pres@@ sing ."
T@@ al@@ k to me about the fe@@ el@@ ing that you m@@ ust have experi@@ en@@ c@@ ed of going to these pri@@ st@@ ine are@@ as and see@@ ing things coming back .
E@@ S : It is a sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al experi@@ ence .
"We go there to try to understand the ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ ems , to try to me@@ as@@ ure or coun@@ t f@@ ish and sh@@ ar@@ ks and see how these plac@@ es are different from the plac@@ es we know ."
"But the best fe@@ el@@ ing is this bi@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a that E.@@ O@@ . W@@ il@@ son tal@@ ks about , where hum@@ ans have this sense of a@@ we and w@@ on@@ der in fr@@ on@@ t of un@@ ta@@ m@@ ed nat@@ ure , of ra@@ w nat@@ ure ."
"And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a lar@@ ger thing or of a lar@@ ger g@@ lob@@ al ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem ."
"And if it were not for these plac@@ es that show hop@@ e , I don &apos;t think I could cont@@ in@@ ue doing this jo@@ b ."
It would be just too de@@ pres@@ sing .
"C@@ A : W@@ ell , En@@ ri@@ c , th@@ ank you so much for sh@@ ar@@ ing some of that sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al experi@@ ence with us all . Thank you ."
E@@ S : Thank you very much .
"So it &apos;s 19@@ 9@@ 5 , I &apos;m in col@@ le@@ ge , and a fri@@ end and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from P@@ ro@@ vi@@ d@@ ence , R@@ ho@@ de I@@ sl@@ and to P@@ ort@@ l@@ and , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."

"And some@@ where in the mi@@ dd@@ le of S@@ ou@@ th D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a , I tur@@ n to my fri@@ end and I as@@ k her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 mil@@ es ."

And what I &apos;m tal@@ king about is this .
"( Laughter ) Ri@@ ght , the fam@@ ous Ch@@ in@@ ese ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter for pic@@ n@@ ic are@@ a . ( Laughter )@@ "
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last fi@@ ve years of my life thinking about s@@ it@@ u@@ ations ex@@ ac@@ tly like this — why we some@@ times m@@ is@@ understand the si@@ gn@@ s around us , and how we be@@ have when that happen@@ s , and what all of this can tell us about human nat@@ ure ."
"In other wor@@ ds , as you he@@ ard Ch@@ r@@ is say , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last fi@@ ve years thinking about being wr@@ ong ."
"This might stri@@ ke you as a str@@ an@@ ge car@@ e@@ er mo@@ ve , but it actually has one great ad@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ age : no jo@@ b com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) I@@ n fact , most of us do everything we can to a@@ vo@@ id thinking about being wr@@ ong , or at le@@ ast to a@@ vo@@ id thinking about the pos@@ si@@ b@@ ility that we our@@ selves are wr@@ ong ."
We get it in the ab@@ str@@ act .
We all know every@@ body in this room ma@@ kes mi@@ sta@@ kes .
"The human spec@@ ies , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — ok@@ ay f@@ ine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beli@@ ef@@ s I ho@@ ld , here in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly all of this ab@@ str@@ act ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ b@@ ility go@@ es out the w@@ in@@ d@@ ow — and I can &apos;t actually think of any@@ thing I &apos;m wr@@ ong about ."
"And the thing is , the pres@@ ent ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se ; we go on fami@@ ly va@@ ca@@ tions in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se ; we go to the p@@ oll@@ s and v@@ ot@@ e in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se .
"So eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve@@ ly , we all kind of w@@ ind up tra@@ vel@@ ing through life , tr@@ app@@ ed in this little bu@@ b@@ ble of fe@@ el@@ ing very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als , in our per@@ s@@ on@@ al and pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al li@@ ves , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve@@ ly as a cul@@ ture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get st@@ uc@@ k in@@ side this fe@@ el@@ ing of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s s@@ uch a problem ."
"And fin@@ ally , I want to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you that it is pos@@ sible to ste@@ p out@@ side of that fe@@ el@@ ing and that if you can do so , it is the sing@@ le gre@@ at@@ est mor@@ al , int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ al and cre@@ a@@ tive lea@@ p you can make ."
So why do we get st@@ uc@@ k in this fe@@ el@@ ing of being right ?
"O@@ n@@ e reas@@ on , actually , has to do with a fe@@ el@@ ing of being wr@@ ong ."
"So let me as@@ k you gu@@ ys something — or actually , let me as@@ k you gu@@ ys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — e@@ mo@@ tion@@ ally — how does it feel to be wr@@ ong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ umb@@ s down .
"E@@ mb@@ ar@@ r@@ as@@ sing . Ok@@ ay , w@@ on@@ der@@ ful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ umb@@ s down , em@@ b@@ ar@@ r@@ as@@ sing — th@@ ank you , these are great an@@ sw@@ ers , but they &apos;re an@@ sw@@ ers to a different question ."
You gu@@ ys are an@@ sw@@ er@@ ing the question : How does it feel to re@@ aliz@@ e you &apos;re wr@@ ong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wr@@ ong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be de@@ va@@ st@@ ating , it can be re@@ vel@@ at@@ ory , it can actually be quite f@@ un@@ n@@ y , like my stu@@ p@@ id Ch@@ in@@ ese ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
But just being wr@@ ong doesn &apos;t feel like any@@ thing .
I &apos;ll give you an an@@ al@@ o@@ gy .
D@@ o you re@@ memb@@ er that Lo@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ y@@ ot@@ e who &apos;s always c@@ ha@@ sing and never ca@@ t@@ ch@@ ing a ro@@ ad@@ r@@ un@@ n@@ er ?
"In pret@@ ty much every ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a mom@@ ent where the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e is c@@ ha@@ sing the ro@@ ad@@ r@@ un@@ n@@ er and the ro@@ ad@@ r@@ un@@ n@@ er r@@ un@@ s off a cli@@ ff , which is f@@ ine — he &apos;s a b@@ ir@@ d , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e r@@ un@@ s off the cli@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s f@@ un@@ n@@ y — at le@@ ast if you &apos;re si@@ x years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally f@@ ine too .
He just ke@@ ep@@ s r@@ un@@ ning — right up un@@ ti@@ l the mom@@ ent that he loo@@ ks down and re@@ aliz@@ es that he &apos;s in mi@@ d-@@ a@@ ir .
That &apos;s when he f@@ all@@ s .
"When we &apos;re wr@@ ong about something — not when we re@@ aliz@@ e it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ot@@ e after he &apos;s g@@ one off the cli@@ ff and before he loo@@ ks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re al@@ ready wr@@ ong , we &apos;re al@@ ready in tr@@ ou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d gr@@ ound ."
So I should actually cor@@ rec@@ t something I said a mom@@ ent ago .
It does feel like something to be wr@@ ong ; it fe@@ el@@ s like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reas@@ on , a struc@@ tur@@ al reas@@ on , why we get st@@ uc@@ k in@@ side this fe@@ el@@ ing of ri@@ gh@@ tn@@ ess ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r bl@@ in@@ dn@@ ess .
"M@@ ost of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ n@@ al c@@ ue to let us know that we &apos;re wr@@ ong about something , un@@ ti@@ l it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
But there &apos;s a second reas@@ on that we get st@@ uc@@ k in@@ side this fe@@ el@@ ing as well — and this one is cul@@ tur@@ al .
Th@@ in@@ k back for a mom@@ ent to el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school .
"You &apos;re s@@ it@@ ting there in cl@@ as@@ s , and your te@@ ac@@ her is h@@ an@@ ding back qu@@ i@@ z p@@ ap@@ ers , and one of them loo@@ ks like this ."
"This is not m@@ ine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know ex@@ ac@@ tly what to think about the k@@ id who got this p@@ ap@@ er ."
"It &apos;s the d@@ um@@ b k@@ id , the tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ k@@ er , the one who never does his h@@ om@@ e@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve al@@ ready lear@@ ned , first of all , that people who get stu@@ ff wr@@ ong are la@@ z@@ y , ir@@ resp@@ on@@ sible di@@ m@@ w@@ its — and second of all , that the way to s@@ uc@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any mi@@ sta@@ kes ."
We lear@@ n these really b@@ ad l@@ ess@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally a lot of us in this room — de@@ al with them by just be@@ coming per@@ f@@ ect little A stu@@ d@@ ents , per@@ f@@ ec@@ tion@@ i@@ sts , over@@ -@@ ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ver@@ s ."
"@@ Ri@@ ght , Mr@@ . C@@ F@@ O , a@@ st@@ ro@@ ph@@ ys@@ ic@@ ist , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , a@@ st@@ ro@@ ph@@ ys@@ ici@@ sts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ ers , it tur@@ ns out ."
"O@@ k@@ ay , so f@@ ine ."
Ex@@ cep@@ t that then we f@@ re@@ a@@ k out at the pos@@ si@@ b@@ ility that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wr@@ ong .
"@@ Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wr@@ ong means there &apos;s something wr@@ ong with us ."
"So we just in@@ si@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it ma@@ kes us feel sm@@ art and resp@@ on@@ sible and vir@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"@@ A cou@@ ple of years ago , a wom@@ an comes into Be@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el De@@ ac@@ on@@ ess Me@@ di@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter for a sur@@ g@@ er@@ y ."
Be@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ t@@ on .
It &apos;s the te@@ ach@@ ing h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this wom@@ an comes in and she &apos;s ta@@ k@@ en into the op@@ er@@ ating room .
"S@@ he &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ch@@ es her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the re@@ co@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing se@@ ems to have g@@ one f@@ ine .
"And she wa@@ kes up , and she loo@@ ks down at h@@ er@@ self , and she sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ y is the wr@@ ong side of my body in b@@ and@@ ag@@ es ? &quot; &quot; W@@ ell the wr@@ ong side of her body is in b@@ and@@ ag@@ es because the sur@@ ge@@ on has per@@ form@@ ed a ma@@ j@@ or op@@ er@@ ation on her left le@@ g in@@ ste@@ ad of her right one ."
"When the v@@ ice pre@@ si@@ d@@ ent for heal@@ th c@@ are qu@@ ality at Be@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el sp@@ o@@ ke about this in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent , he said something very interesting ."
"H@@ e said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or wh@@ at@@ ever reas@@ on , the sur@@ ge@@ on si@@ mp@@ ly f@@ el@@ t that he was on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of the pa@@ ti@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tr@@ u@@ st@@ ing too much in the fe@@ el@@ ing of being on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of any@@ thing can be very d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous ."
This inter@@ n@@ al sense of ri@@ gh@@ tn@@ ess that we all experi@@ ence so of@@ ten is not a re@@ li@@ able gu@@ i@@ de to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world .
"And when we act like it is , and we st@@ op en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ing the pos@@ si@@ b@@ ility that we could be wr@@ ong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like du@@ mp@@ ing 20@@ 0 million g@@ all@@ ons of o@@ il into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or t@@ or@@ pe@@ doing the g@@ lob@@ al econom@@ y ."
So this is a hu@@ ge pr@@ ac@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a hu@@ ge soci@@ al problem .
Th@@ in@@ k for a mom@@ ent about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beli@@ ef@@ s just per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly re@@ fl@@ ect re@@ ality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to ex@@ pla@@ in all of those people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with you ?"
"It tur@@ ns out , most of us ex@@ pla@@ in those people the same way , by res@@ or@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ate as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions ."
The first thing we us@@ u@@ ally do when some@@ one dis@@ ag@@ re@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ig@@ n@@ or@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have ac@@ cess to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ous@@ ly sh@@ are that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our te@@ am ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it tur@@ ns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still dis@@ ag@@ ree with us , then we mo@@ ve on to a second as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right piec@@ es of the pu@@ zz@@ le , and they are too mor@@ on@@ ic to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it tur@@ ns out that people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pret@@ ty sm@@ art , then we mo@@ ve on to a th@@ ir@@ d as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion : they know the tr@@ u@@ th , and they are de@@ li@@ b@@ er@@ at@@ ely di@@ stor@@ ting it for their own m@@ al@@ ev@@ ol@@ ent p@@ ur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he .
This at@@ t@@ ach@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ tn@@ ess ke@@ ep@@ s us from pre@@ v@@ en@@ ting mi@@ sta@@ kes when we ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tely need to and ca@@ us@@ es us to tre@@ at each other ter@@ ri@@ b@@ ly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most ba@@ ff@@ l@@ ing and most tra@@ gi@@ c about this is that it m@@ is@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to ima@@ gine that our min@@ ds are just these per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly tran@@ sl@@ uc@@ ent w@@ in@@ do@@ ws and we just ga@@ ze out of them and des@@ cri@@ be the world as it un@@ f@@ ol@@ ds .
And we want every@@ body el@@ se to ga@@ ze out of the same w@@ in@@ d@@ ow and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not tr@@ ue , and if it were , life would be incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly bor@@ ing ."
The m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le of your m@@ ind is@@ n &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it is@@ n &apos;t .
"We can re@@ memb@@ er the p@@ ast , and we can think about the future , and we can ima@@ gine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same ni@@ ght sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ a@@ h , it is also why we get things wr@@ ong ."
"@@ 1,@@ 20@@ 0 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ t@@ es said his fam@@ ous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ ef@@ ore I am , &quot; &quot; this gu@@ y , St@@ .

It &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al to who we are .
"@@ Because , un@@ like G@@ od , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other an@@ im@@ als , we are ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with trying to fi@@ g@@ ure it out ."

"And so I &apos;m li@@ st@@ en@@ ing and I &apos;m li@@ st@@ en@@ ing , and at some point , I start fe@@ el@@ ing like all the stor@@ ies are about being wr@@ ong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve l@@ ost it ."
I &apos;ve become the c@@ ra@@ z@@ y wr@@ on@@ gn@@ ess l@@ ad@@ y .
"I just ima@@ gin@@ ed it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a cou@@ ple of mon@@ ths l@@ ater , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ vi@@ e@@ w Ir@@ a Gl@@ as@@ s , who &apos;s the h@@ ost of the show ."
"And I m@@ en@@ tion@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; N@@ o actually , that &apos;s tr@@ ue ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ af@@ f , we jo@@ ke that every sing@@ le ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of our show has the same cr@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the cr@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happ@@ en and something el@@ se happened in@@ ste@@ ad . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; sa@@ ys Ir@@ a Gl@@ as@@ s , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mom@@ ents of sur@@ pri@@ se and re@@ ver@@ s@@ al and wr@@ on@@ gn@@ ess to make these stor@@ ies work . &quot; &quot; And for the re@@ st of us , au@@ di@@ ence memb@@ ers , as li@@ st@@ en@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we e@@ at this stu@@ ff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot tw@@ i@@ sts and red h@@ er@@ r@@ ings and sur@@ pri@@ se end@@ ings .
"When it comes to our stor@@ ies , we love being wr@@ ong ."
"But , you know , our stor@@ ies are like this because our li@@ ves are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happ@@ en and something el@@ se happen@@ s in@@ ste@@ ad .
"G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h thought he was going to inv@@ ad@@ e I@@ ra@@ q , find a b@@ un@@ ch of we@@ ap@@ ons of ma@@ s@@ s de@@ struc@@ tion , li@@ b@@ er@@ ate the people and br@@ ing de@@ mo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y to the Mi@@ dd@@ le E@@ ast ."
And something el@@ se happened in@@ ste@@ ad .

And something el@@ se happened in@@ ste@@ ad .
And maybe you thought you were going to gro@@ w up and mar@@ ry your hi@@ gh school s@@ we@@ e@@ the@@ art and mo@@ ve back to your h@@ om@@ e@@ to@@ wn and ra@@ i@@ se a b@@ un@@ ch of ki@@ ds together .
And something el@@ se happened in@@ ste@@ ad .

And something el@@ se happened in@@ ste@@ ad .

"F@@ or good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incre@@ di@@ ble stor@@ ies about the world around us , and then the world tur@@ ns around and a@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ es us ."

( Applause ) So here we are again .

We come up with another idea .

"In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t as@@ k a techno@@ lo@@ g@@ ist , a sci@@ enti@@ st , a ph@@ ys@@ ic@@ ist ."

And that con@@ st@@ ant is the spe@@ ed of s@@ ound .

"( Laughter ) And I started w@@ on@@ der@@ ing , are there things that I can do , sy@@ st@@ ems that I can put into place , that will pre@@ v@@ ent b@@ ad things from happen@@ ing ?"
"Now , you all know what the pos@@ t@@ mor@@ te@@ m is ."
"Well , in the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m , D@@ an@@ n@@ y ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed , you look a@@ he@@ ad and you try to fi@@ g@@ ure out all the things that could go wr@@ ong , and then you try to fi@@ g@@ ure out what you can do to pre@@ v@@ ent those things from happen@@ ing , or to min@@ i@@ mi@@ ze the da@@ ma@@ ge ."
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
"S@@ ome of them are ob@@ vi@@ ous , some of them are not so ob@@ vi@@ ous ."
I &apos;ll start with the ob@@ vi@@ ous ones .
"A@@ r@@ ound the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a place for things that are e@@ as@@ i@@ ly l@@ ost ."
"Now , this s@@ oun@@ ds like comm@@ on sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of sci@@ ence to back this up , bas@@ ed on the way our sp@@ a@@ ti@@ al me@@ mor@@ y wor@@ ks ."
"There &apos;s a struc@@ ture in the brain called the hi@@ p@@ po@@ ca@@ mp@@ us , that ev@@ ol@@ ved over ten@@ s of thou@@ s@@ ands of years , to ke@@ ep tr@@ ack of the lo@@ ca@@ tions of important things — where the well is , where f@@ ish can be found , that st@@ and of f@@ ru@@ it tre@@ es , where the fri@@ end@@ ly and en@@ e@@ my tri@@ b@@ es live ."
It &apos;s the part of the brain that al@@ low@@ s s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l@@ s to find their nu@@ ts .
"And if you &apos;re w@@ on@@ der@@ ing , some@@ body actually did the exper@@ im@@ ent where they c@@ ut off the ol@@ fac@@ t@@ ory sense of the s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l@@ s , and they could still find their nu@@ ts ."
"They w@@ er@@ en &apos;t using sm@@ ell , they were using the hi@@ p@@ po@@ ca@@ mp@@ us , this ex@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ ely ev@@ ol@@ ved m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ m in the brain for fin@@ ding things ."
"But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t mo@@ ve around much , not so good for things that mo@@ ve around ."
So this is why we l@@ ose ca@@ r ke@@ ys and read@@ ing gl@@ as@@ ses and p@@ as@@ sp@@ or@@ ts .
"So in the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a sp@@ o@@ t for your ke@@ ys — a h@@ oo@@ k by the do@@ or , maybe a d@@ ec@@ or@@ a@@ tive bo@@ w@@ l ."
"F@@ or your p@@ as@@ sp@@ ort , a par@@ tic@@ ular d@@ ra@@ w@@ er ."
"F@@ or your read@@ ing gl@@ as@@ ses , a par@@ tic@@ ular t@@ able ."
"If you desig@@ n@@ ate a sp@@ o@@ t and you &apos;re sc@@ ru@@ p@@ ul@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them ."
What about tra@@ vel ?
"T@@ a@@ ke a c@@ ell ph@@ one pic@@ ture of your cre@@ d@@ it car@@ ds , your dri@@ ver &apos;s li@@ cen@@ se , your p@@ as@@ sp@@ ort , ma@@ il it to y@@ our@@ self so it &apos;s in the cl@@ ou@@ d ."
Now these are some ra@@ ther ob@@ vi@@ ous things .
"@@ Re@@ memb@@ er , when you &apos;re und@@ er st@@ res@@ s , the brain re@@ le@@ as@@ es cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l ."
"C@@ or@@ ti@@ so@@ l is to@@ x@@ ic , and it ca@@ us@@ es cl@@ ou@@ dy thinking ."
"So part of the pr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ce of the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e that und@@ er st@@ res@@ s you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put sy@@ st@@ ems in place ."
And there &apos;s per@@ h@@ ap@@ s no more st@@ res@@ s@@ ful a s@@ it@@ u@@ ation than when you &apos;re con@@ fr@@ on@@ ted with a medi@@ cal deci@@ sion to make .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very par@@ tic@@ ular medi@@ cal con@@ di@@ tion .
"But this st@@ ands as a pro@@ x@@ y for all k@@ in@@ ds of medi@@ cal deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making , and in@@ de@@ ed for fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making , and soci@@ al deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making — any kind of deci@@ sion you have to make that would b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from a ra@@ tional as@@ s@@ es@@ sm@@ ent of the fac@@ ts ."
"So su@@ pp@@ ose you go to your do@@ ct@@ or and the do@@ ct@@ or sa@@ ys , &quot; I just got your la@@ b work back , your cho@@ le@@ st@@ er@@ o@@ l &apos;s a little hi@@ gh . &quot;"
"Now , you all know that hi@@ gh cho@@ le@@ st@@ er@@ o@@ l is as@@ soci@@ ated with an incre@@ as@@ ed ri@@ s@@ k of car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar di@@ se@@ ase , he@@ art at@@ t@@ ack , st@@ ro@@ ke ."
It &apos;s for the number nee@@ ded to tre@@ at .
"Now , what is this , the N@@ N@@ T ?"
It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a d@@ ru@@ g or under@@ go a sur@@ g@@ er@@ y or any medi@@ cal pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure before one person is hel@@ p@@ ed .
"And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of c@@ ra@@ z@@ y sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ c is that ?"
The number should be one .
"But actually , medi@@ cal pr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ce doesn &apos;t work that way ."
"And it &apos;s not the do@@ ct@@ or &apos;s fa@@ ult , if it &apos;s any@@ body &apos;s fa@@ ult , it &apos;s the fa@@ ult of sci@@ enti@@ sts like me ."
But G@@ la@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mi@@ th@@ K@@ line es@@ ti@@ mat@@ es that 9@@ 0 percent of the d@@ ru@@ gs work in only 3@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 percent of the people .
"So the number nee@@ ded to tre@@ at for the most wi@@ de@@ ly pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ ed sta@@ ti@@ n , what do you su@@ pp@@ ose it is ?"
How many people have to take it before one person is hel@@ p@@ ed ?
I r@@ an through the numb@@ ers my@@ self .
"@@ 30@@ 0 people have to take the d@@ ru@@ g for a year before one he@@ art at@@ t@@ ack , st@@ ro@@ ke or other ad@@ ver@@ se ev@@ ent is pre@@ v@@ en@@ ted ."
"Now you &apos;re prob@@ ably thinking , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , O@@ K , one in 30@@ 0 chan@@ ce of low@@ er@@ ing my cho@@ le@@ st@@ er@@ o@@ l ."
"Wh@@ y not , do@@ c ? Gi@@ ve me the pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tion any@@ way . &quot; &quot; But you should as@@ k at this point for another sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ c , and that is , &quot; &quot; T@@ ell me about the side eff@@ ects . &quot; &quot; Ri@@ ght ?"
"So for this par@@ tic@@ ular d@@ ru@@ g , the side eff@@ ects oc@@ cu@@ r in fi@@ ve percent of the pa@@ ti@@ ents ."
You &apos;re 1@@ 5 times more li@@ ke@@ ly to be h@@ ar@@ m@@ ed by the d@@ ru@@ g than you are to be hel@@ p@@ ed by the d@@ ru@@ g .
I &apos;m just sa@@ ying you should have this con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with your do@@ ct@@ or .
You have the right to have ac@@ cess to this kind of information to be@@ g@@ in the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about whe@@ ther you want to take the ri@@ s@@ ks or not .
"F@@ or the most wi@@ de@@ ly per@@ form@@ ed sur@@ g@@ er@@ y on m@@ en over the age of 5@@ 0 , re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of the pr@@ os@@ t@@ ate for can@@ c@@ er , the number nee@@ ded to tre@@ at is 4@@ 9 ."
"That &apos;s right , 4@@ 9 sur@@ g@@ er@@ ies are done for every one person who &apos;s hel@@ p@@ ed ."
And the side eff@@ ects in that ca@@ se oc@@ cu@@ r in 5@@ 0 percent of the pa@@ ti@@ ents .
"They in@@ cl@@ u@@ de imp@@ ot@@ ence , er@@ ec@@ ti@@ le d@@ ys@@ f@@ un@@ c@@ tion , ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ cont@@ in@@ ence , rec@@ t@@ al te@@ ar@@ ing , fe@@ cal in@@ cont@@ in@@ ence ."
"And if you &apos;re l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , and you &apos;re one of the 5@@ 0 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two ."
And you also want to think about things like qu@@ ality of life .
"@@ Because you have a cho@@ ice of@@ t@@ enti@@ m@@ es , do you I want a sh@@ or@@ ter life that &apos;s pa@@ in@@ -@@ f@@ ree , or a l@@ on@@ ger life that might have a great de@@ al of pa@@ in to@@ war@@ ds the end ?"
There &apos;s an ev@@ ol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary reas@@ on for this .
"F@@ ac@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ face with a pre@@ dat@@ or , you don &apos;t need your di@@ g@@ es@@ tive system , or your li@@ bi@@ do , or your im@@ m@@ un@@ e system , because if you &apos;re body is exp@@ en@@ ding me@@ t@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ s@@ m on those things and you don &apos;t re@@ act qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , you might become the lion &apos;s l@@ un@@ ch , and then n@@ one of those things mat@@ ter ."
"@@ Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , one of the things that go@@ es out the w@@ in@@ d@@ ow d@@ ur@@ ing those times of st@@ res@@ s is ra@@ tional , logi@@ cal thinking , as D@@ an@@ n@@ y K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man and his col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es have sh@@ own ."
So we need to tra@@ in our@@ selves to think a@@ he@@ ad to these k@@ in@@ ds of s@@ it@@ u@@ ations .
I think the important point here is re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ ing that all of us are f@@ la@@ w@@ ed .
We all are going to fa@@ il now and then .
"The idea is to think a@@ he@@ ad to what those fa@@ il@@ u@@ res might be , to put sy@@ st@@ ems in place that will help min@@ i@@ mi@@ ze the da@@ ma@@ ge , or to pre@@ v@@ ent the b@@ ad things from happen@@ ing in the first place ."
"And I have to ad@@ m@@ it , I still have p@@ il@@ es of ma@@ il that ha@@ ven &apos;t been s@@ or@@ ted , and p@@ il@@ es of e@@ ma@@ il@@ s that I ha@@ ven &apos;t g@@ one through ."

I didn &apos;t want to ju@@ d@@ ge him with the same c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty that he ju@@ d@@ ged me .
The Ar@@ ab@@ ic l@@ an@@ gu@@ age doesn &apos;t sa@@ ti@@ s@@ f@@ y today &apos;s nee@@ ds .
"It &apos;s not a l@@ an@@ gu@@ age for sci@@ ence , re@@ sear@@ ch , a l@@ an@@ gu@@ age we &apos;re used to in uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties , a l@@ an@@ gu@@ age we use in the wor@@ k@@ place , a l@@ an@@ gu@@ age we re@@ ly on if we were to per@@ form an ad@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ ed re@@ sear@@ ch proj@@ ect , and it de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely is@@ n &apos;t a l@@ an@@ gu@@ age we use at the a@@ ir@@ p@@ ort ."
"If we did so , they &apos;d stri@@ p us of our c@@ lo@@ th@@ es ."
"W@@ here can I use it , then ? We could all as@@ k this question !@@ "
"So , you want us to use Ar@@ ab@@ ic . W@@ here are we to do so ?"
This is one re@@ ality .
But we have another more important re@@ ality that we ou@@ ght to think about .
Ar@@ ab@@ ic is the mo@@ ther t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch sa@@ ys that ma@@ st@@ er@@ y of other l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es de@@ m@@ ands ma@@ st@@ er@@ y of the mo@@ ther t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
Ma@@ st@@ er@@ y of the mo@@ ther t@@ on@@ gu@@ e is a pr@@ er@@ e@@ qu@@ is@@ ite for cre@@ a@@ tive ex@@ pres@@ sion in other l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es .
"G@@ i@@ br@@ an K@@ hal@@ il Gi@@ br@@ an , when he first started wr@@ iting , he used Ar@@ ab@@ ic ."
"A@@ ll his ide@@ as , ima@@ gin@@ ation and ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y were in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by this little bo@@ y in the v@@ ill@@ age where he gre@@ w up , sm@@ ell@@ ing a sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c sm@@ ell , he@@ ar@@ ing a sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c vo@@ ice , and thinking a sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c thought ."
"So , when he started wr@@ iting in En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h , he had enough b@@ ag@@ g@@ age ."
"E@@ ven when he wr@@ ot@@ e in En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h , when you re@@ ad his wr@@ it@@ ings in En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h , you sm@@ ell the same sm@@ ell , sense the same fe@@ el@@ ing ."
"You can ima@@ gine that that &apos;s him wr@@ iting in En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h , the same bo@@ y who came from the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ in . F@@ rom a v@@ ill@@ age on M@@ oun@@ t Le@@ b@@ an@@ on ."
"So , this is an example no one can ar@@ gu@@ e with ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , it &apos;s of@@ ten said that if you want to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , the only way to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , is to k@@ ill its l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ."
This is a re@@ ality that develop@@ ed soci@@ e@@ ties are aw@@ are of .
"The G@@ er@@ m@@ ans , Fr@@ en@@ ch , J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese and Ch@@ in@@ ese , all these na@@ tions are aw@@ are of this ."
They make it s@@ ac@@ red .
"That &apos;s why they use it in produc@@ tion , they p@@ ay a lot of money to devel@@ op it ."
"A@@ ll right , we ar@@ en &apos;t from the develop@@ ed world , this ad@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ ed thinking ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t re@@ ach@@ ed us ye@@ t , and we would like to ca@@ t@@ ch up with the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ed world ."
"C@@ oun@@ tries that were on@@ ce like us , but deci@@ ded to stri@@ ve for develop@@ ment , do re@@ sear@@ ch , and ca@@ t@@ ch up with those coun@@ tries , s@@ uch as T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey , M@@ al@@ ay@@ si@@ a and o@@ th@@ ers , they car@@ ri@@ ed their l@@ an@@ gu@@ age with them as they were cli@@ mb@@ ing the l@@ ad@@ der , prot@@ ec@@ ted it like a di@@ am@@ on@@ d ."
They ke@@ p@@ t it cl@@ ose to them .
"@@ Because if you get any produc@@ t from T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey or el@@ se@@ where and it &apos;s not la@@ be@@ l@@ ed in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , then it is@@ n &apos;t a lo@@ cal produc@@ t ."
You w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a lo@@ cal produc@@ t .
"They &apos;d go back to being con@@ su@@ m@@ ers , cl@@ u@@ el@@ ess con@@ su@@ m@@ ers , like we are most of the time ."
"So , in or@@ der for them to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate and pro@@ du@@ ce , they had to prot@@ ect their l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ."
"It doesn &apos;t r@@ ing a be@@ ll , does it ?"
"@@ Re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the who , how and why ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age is@@ n &apos;t just for con@@ ver@@ sing , just wor@@ ds coming out of our m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"So when we say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ do@@ m , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , in@@ de@@ p@@ end@@ ence , &quot; &quot; each one of you d@@ ra@@ ws a sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c ima@@ ge in their own m@@ ind , there are sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c fe@@ el@@ ings of a sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c day in a sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c hi@@ stor@@ i@@ cal per@@ i@@ od ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age is@@ n &apos;t one , two or three wor@@ ds or le@@ t@@ ters put together ."
"It &apos;s an idea in@@ side that re@@ l@@ ates to how we think , and how we see each other and how o@@ th@@ ers see us ."
What is our int@@ ell@@ ect ?
How do you say whe@@ ther this gu@@ y underst@@ ands or not ?
"So , if I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ do@@ m , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , in@@ de@@ p@@ end@@ ence ( En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; D@@ ad , have you li@@ ved through the per@@ i@@ od of the f@@ re@@ e@@ do@@ m ( En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h ) s@@ lo@@ g@@ an ? &quot;"
How would you feel ?
"If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better lea@@ ve , and st@@ op tal@@ king in va@@ in ."
The idea is that these ex@@ pres@@ si@@ ons re@@ m@@ ind us of a sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c thing .
I have a fr@@ an@@ c@@ op@@ h@@ one fri@@ end who &apos;s mar@@ ri@@ ed to a Fr@@ en@@ ch man .
I as@@ ked her on@@ ce how things were going .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing is f@@ ine , but on@@ ce , I sp@@ ent a whole ni@@ ght as@@ king and trying to tran@@ sl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of the wor@@ d &apos; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The po@@ or wom@@ an had mi@@ st@@ ak@@ en@@ ly to@@ ld him &quot; &quot; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i , &quot; &quot; and then sp@@ ent the whole ni@@ ght trying to ex@@ pla@@ in it to him ."
He was pu@@ zz@@ l@@ ed by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could any@@ one be this c@@ ru@@ el ?
Do@@ es she want to comm@@ it su@@ ici@@ de ?
&apos;@@ B@@ ur@@ y me ? &apos; ( En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es .
"It made us feel that she &apos;s un@@ able to tell that wor@@ d to her h@@ us@@ b@@ and , s@@ in@@ ce he w@@ on &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different ."
Tr@@ an@@ sl@@ ate that for me .
"( Applause ) So , what have we done to prot@@ ect the Ar@@ ab@@ ic l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ?"
"We tur@@ ned this into a con@@ cer@@ n of the ci@@ vi@@ l soci@@ e@@ ty , and we la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed a ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n to pres@@ er@@ ve the Ar@@ ab@@ ic l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ."

"We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; N@@ o ! We do not ac@@ cep@@ t this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t ad@@ op@@ t this st@@ y@@ le because that way , we w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be underst@@ ood ."

"S@@ om@@ e@@ thing very e@@ as@@ y , ye@@ t cre@@ a@@ tive and per@@ su@@ as@@ i@@ ve ."

A@@ m I s@@ it@@ ting down in a ste@@ ak@@ h@@ ou@@ se to a 1@@ 6-@@ oun@@ ce p@@ or@@ tion of this ?
D@@ o I do this three times a we@@ e@@ k ?
"I might still be in the gre@@ en li@@ st , but I &apos;m not doing my@@ self , or you , or the o@@ ce@@ ans any fa@@ v@@ ors ."
"The point is that we have to have a cont@@ ex@@ t , a g@@ au@@ ge for our ac@@ tions in all this ."
Ex@@ a@@ mple : I &apos;ve he@@ ard that red w@@ ine is great for my heal@@ th — an@@ ti@@ o@@ x@@ id@@ an@@ ts and min@@ er@@ als — he@@ art heal@@ th@@ y .
That &apos;s great ! I love red w@@ ine !
I &apos;m going to dr@@ in@@ k so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so heal@@ th@@ y .
"Well , how many bot@@ tl@@ es is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?"
"Well f@@ ol@@ ks , we have a prot@@ e@@ in problem ."
"We have l@@ ost this sen@@ si@@ b@@ ility when it re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds our food , and we are p@@ ay@@ ing a c@@ ost ."
The problem is we are hi@@ ding that c@@ ost b@@ en@@ e@@ ath the wa@@ ves .
We are hi@@ ding that c@@ ost be@@ h@@ ind the soci@@ al ac@@ cep@@ t@@ ance of exp@@ an@@ ding wa@@ i@@ st@@ l@@ in@@ es .
And we are hi@@ ding that c@@ ost be@@ h@@ ind mon@@ ster pro@@ f@@ its .
So the first thing about this idea of re@@ stor@@ a@@ tive se@@ af@@ ood is that it really ta@@ kes into ac@@ coun@@ t our nee@@ ds .
"@@ Re@@ stor@@ a@@ tive se@@ af@@ ood might best be re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted not by J@@ aw@@ s , or by F@@ li@@ pp@@ er , or the G@@ or@@ don &apos;s fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man , but ra@@ ther , by the J@@ ol@@ ly G@@ re@@ en Gi@@ ant ."
V@@ e@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ l@@ es : they might ye@@ t sa@@ ve the o@@ ce@@ ans .
S@@ yl@@ vi@@ a li@@ kes to say that bl@@ ue is the new gre@@ en .
W@@ ell I &apos;d like to re@@ spec@@ t@@ ful@@ ly su@@ bm@@ it that b@@ ro@@ c@@ col@@ i gre@@ en might then be the new bl@@ ue .
"We m@@ ust cont@@ in@@ ue to e@@ at the best se@@ af@@ ood pos@@ sible , if at all ."
But we also m@@ ust e@@ at it with a t@@ on of ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ l@@ es .
The best part about re@@ stor@@ a@@ tive se@@ af@@ ood th@@ ough is that it comes on the hal@@ f-@@ sh@@ ell with a bot@@ tle of T@@ ab@@ as@@ c@@ o and le@@ m@@ on we@@ d@@ ges .
"It comes in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ oun@@ ce p@@ or@@ tion of ti@@ l@@ ap@@ i@@ a b@@ read@@ ed with Di@@ j@@ on mu@@ star@@ d and cri@@ sp@@ y , b@@ ro@@ il@@ ed b@@ read@@ cr@@ umb@@ s and a ste@@ am@@ ing pi@@ le of pe@@ can qu@@ in@@ o@@ a p@@ il@@ a@@ f with cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y , g@@ ri@@ ll@@ ed b@@ ro@@ c@@ col@@ i so so@@ ft and s@@ we@@ et and ch@@ ar@@ red and s@@ mo@@ k@@ y on the out@@ side with just a h@@ int of chil@@ i f@@ la@@ ke ."
Wh@@ oo@@ o !
This is an e@@ as@@ y s@@ ell .
And the best part is all of those in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents are a@@ va@@ il@@ able to every fami@@ ly at the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood W@@ al@@ mar@@ t .
J@@ am@@ i@@ e O@@ li@@ ver is ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ ning to sa@@ ve Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a from the way we e@@ at .
S@@ yl@@ vi@@ a is ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ ning to sa@@ ve the o@@ ce@@ ans from the way we e@@ at .
There &apos;s a p@@ at@@ ter@@ n here .
F@@ or@@ get n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar ho@@ lo@@ ca@@ ust ; it &apos;s the for@@ k that we have to wor@@ ry about .
We have ra@@ v@@ ag@@ ed our E@@ ar@@ th and then used the food that we &apos;ve s@@ our@@ c@@ ed to h@@ an@@ di@@ ca@@ p our@@ selves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole e@@ ating thing wr@@ ong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we exp@@ ect from our food .
Su@@ sta@@ in@@ ab@@ ility is comp@@ li@@ ca@@ ted but d@@ in@@ n@@ er is a re@@ ality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of mo@@ v@@ ement rec@@ ently in gre@@ en@@ ing our food sy@@ st@@ ems .
D@@ an B@@ ar@@ b@@ er and A@@ li@@ ce W@@ at@@ ers are le@@ ad@@ ing p@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ at@@ ely the gre@@ en food De@@ li@@ ci@@ ous R@@ ev@@ ol@@ ution .
But gre@@ en f@@ oo@@ ds of@@ ten re@@ pres@@ ent a way for us to dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard the resp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ ility as e@@ at@@ ers .
J@@ ust because it comes from a gre@@ en s@@ our@@ ce doesn &apos;t mean we can tre@@ at it with dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard on the pl@@ ate .
We have ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ end@@ ly sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ end@@ ly all@@ -@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ e@@ at sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p bu@@ ff@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t work .
H@@ ear@@ t-@@ heal@@ th@@ y d@@ in@@ n@@ er is a very important part of re@@ stor@@ a@@ tive se@@ af@@ ood .
"W@@ hi@@ le we try to man@@ age d@@ ec@@ l@@ in@@ ing mar@@ ine p@@ op@@ ul@@ ations , the medi@@ a &apos;s re@@ comm@@ en@@ ding incre@@ as@@ ed con@@ su@@ mp@@ tion of se@@ af@@ ood ."
"S@@ tu@@ di@@ es say that ten@@ s of thou@@ s@@ ands of Am@@ eri@@ can gr@@ and@@ mo@@ th@@ ers , gr@@ and@@ fa@@ th@@ ers , mo@@ th@@ ers and fa@@ th@@ ers might be around for another b@@ ir@@ th@@ day if we in@@ cl@@ u@@ ded more se@@ af@@ ood ."
That &apos;s a re@@ w@@ ard I am not w@@ ill@@ ing to p@@ as@@ s up .
But it &apos;s not all about the se@@ af@@ ood .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our pl@@ ates .
"A@@ s a ch@@ e@@ f , I re@@ aliz@@ e the e@@ as@@ i@@ est thing for me to do is re@@ du@@ ce the p@@ or@@ tion si@@ z@@ es on my pl@@ ate ."
A cou@@ ple things happened .
I made more money .
"P@@ e@@ ople started bu@@ ying ap@@ pe@@ ti@@ z@@ ers and s@@ al@@ a@@ ds , because they k@@ new they w@@ er@@ en &apos;t going to f@@ ill up on the ent@@ re@@ es al@@ one ."
"P@@ e@@ ople sp@@ ent more time en@@ g@@ ag@@ ing in their me@@ als , en@@ g@@ ag@@ ing with each other over their me@@ als ."
"P@@ e@@ ople got , in sh@@ ort , more of what they came there for even th@@ ough they got less prot@@ e@@ in ."
They got more c@@ al@@ or@@ ies over the course of a di@@ ver@@ si@@ fi@@ ed me@@ al .
They got heal@@ th@@ i@@ er . I made more money .
This is great .
"E@@ n@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ent@@ al con@@ si@@ der@@ ation was ser@@ ved with every pl@@ ate , but it was ser@@ ved with a he@@ ap@@ ing m@@ ound of con@@ si@@ der@@ ation for human interest@@ s at the same time ."
"O@@ n@@ e of the other things we did was be@@ g@@ in to di@@ ver@@ si@@ f@@ y the spec@@ ies that we ser@@ ved — small s@@ il@@ ver@@ f@@ ish , an@@ cho@@ vi@@ es , m@@ ac@@ k@@ er@@ el , s@@ ar@@ d@@ in@@ es were un@@ comm@@ on ."
"S@@ h@@ ell@@ f@@ ish , mus@@ sel@@ s , o@@ y@@ st@@ ers , cl@@ am@@ s , ti@@ l@@ ap@@ i@@ a , c@@ ha@@ r — these were the comm@@ on spec@@ ies ."
"We were di@@ rec@@ ting ta@@ st@@ es to@@ war@@ ds more re@@ si@@ li@@ ence , more re@@ stor@@ a@@ tive op@@ tions ."
This is what we need to fa@@ v@@ or .
This is what the gre@@ en li@@ st sa@@ ys .
But this is also how we can actually be@@ g@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore our en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
"But what of those big pre@@ dat@@ ors , those f@@ as@@ hi@@ on@@ able spec@@ ies , that gre@@ en li@@ st t@@ un@@ a that I was tal@@ king about ear@@ li@@ er ?"
"Well , if you m@@ ust , I have a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for you ."
"It pret@@ ty much wor@@ ks with any big f@@ ish in the o@@ ce@@ an , so here we go ."
St@@ art with a 1@@ 6-@@ oun@@ ce p@@ or@@ tion of big f@@ ish .
G@@ et a k@@ ni@@ fe . C@@ ut it into four p@@ or@@ tions .
P@@ ut it on four pl@@ ates .
"M@@ ound up those four pl@@ ates with ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ l@@ es and then op@@ en up the very best bot@@ tle of B@@ ur@@ g@@ und@@ y you have , light the c@@ and@@ l@@ es and c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ate it ."
C@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ate the opp@@ ort@@ unity you have to e@@ at this .
"I@@ n@@ v@@ ite your fri@@ en@@ ds and ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors over and re@@ pe@@ at on@@ ce a year , maybe ."
I exp@@ ect a lot from food .
I exp@@ ect heal@@ th and jo@@ y and fami@@ ly and comm@@ unity .
"I exp@@ ect that produc@@ ing in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents , pre@@ par@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es and e@@ ating me@@ als is all part of the comm@@ uni@@ on of human interest@@ s ."
I was l@@ uc@@ k@@ y enough that my fa@@ ther was a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic c@@ oo@@ k .
And he ta@@ u@@ ght me very ear@@ ly on about the pri@@ v@@ il@@ e@@ ge that e@@ ating re@@ pres@@ ents .
I re@@ memb@@ er well the me@@ als of my chil@@ dh@@ ood .
"They were reas@@ on@@ able p@@ or@@ tions of prot@@ e@@ in ser@@ ved with c@@ op@@ i@@ ous qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ties of ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ l@@ es and small am@@ oun@@ ts of star@@ ch , us@@ u@@ ally ri@@ ce ."
This is still how I lar@@ ge@@ ly e@@ at today .
I get s@@ ic@@ k when I go to ste@@ ak@@ h@@ ous@@ es .
I get the me@@ at s@@ we@@ at@@ s .
It &apos;s like a h@@ an@@ go@@ ver from prot@@ e@@ in .
It &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing .
"But of all the di@@ re ne@@ ws that you &apos;ll he@@ ar and that you have he@@ ard about the st@@ ate of our o@@ ce@@ ans , I have the un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ate b@@ ur@@ d@@ en of de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing to you pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly the very wor@@ st of it and that is this whole time your mo@@ ther was right ."
E@@ at your ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ l@@ es .
It &apos;s pret@@ ty st@@ ra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ for@@ w@@ ard .
So what are we looking for in a me@@ al ?
"Well for heal@@ th , I &apos;m looking for wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that are good for my body ."
"F@@ or jo@@ y , I &apos;m looking for bu@@ tter and s@@ al@@ t and se@@ x@@ y things that make things ta@@ st@@ e less like p@@ en@@ ance ."
"F@@ or fami@@ ly , I &apos;m looking for re@@ ci@@ p@@ es that gen@@ u@@ fl@@ ect to my own per@@ s@@ on@@ al hi@@ stor@@ ies ."
"F@@ or comm@@ unity th@@ ough , we start at the very be@@ gin@@ ning ."
There &apos;s no es@@ cap@@ ing the fact that everything we e@@ at has a g@@ lob@@ al imp@@ act .
So try and lear@@ n as best you can what that imp@@ act is and then take the first ste@@ p to min@@ i@@ mi@@ ze it .
"We &apos;ve se@@ en an ima@@ ge of our bl@@ ue plan@@ et , our world b@@ ank ."
But it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our res@@ our@@ ces ; it &apos;s also the g@@ lob@@ al ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y of the comm@@ uni@@ on we call d@@ in@@ n@@ er .
"So if we all take only what we need , then we can be@@ g@@ in to sh@@ are the re@@ st , we can be@@ g@@ in to c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ate , we can be@@ g@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore ."
We need to sa@@ v@@ or ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ l@@ es .
We need to sa@@ v@@ or sm@@ all@@ er p@@ or@@ tions of se@@ af@@ ood .
And we need to sa@@ ve d@@ in@@ n@@ er .
Thank you .

H@@ i . I am an ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect .
"I am the only ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect in the world making buil@@ d@@ ings out of p@@ ap@@ er like this car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard tu@@ be , and this ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion is the first one I did using p@@ ap@@ er tu@@ b@@ es ."
"@@ 19@@ 8@@ 6 , much , much l@@ on@@ ger before people started tal@@ king about ec@@ o@@ logi@@ cal is@@ su@@ es and en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ent@@ al is@@ su@@ es , I just started te@@ st@@ ing the p@@ ap@@ er tu@@ be in or@@ der to use this as a buil@@ ding struc@@ ture ."
"It &apos;s very comp@@ li@@ ca@@ ted to t@@ est the new mat@@ eri@@ al for the buil@@ ding , but this is much str@@ on@@ ger than I exp@@ ec@@ ted , and also it &apos;s very e@@ as@@ y to w@@ at@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and also , because it &apos;s in@@ du@@ stri@@ al mat@@ eri@@ al , it &apos;s also pos@@ sible to fi@@ re@@ pro@@ of ."
"Th@@ en I buil@@ t the te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary struc@@ ture , 19@@ 9@@ 0 ."
This is the first te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary buil@@ ding made out of p@@ ap@@ er .
"There are 3@@ 3@@ 0 tu@@ b@@ es , di@@ a@@ me@@ ter 5@@ 5 &#9@@ 1@@ ; c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters &#9@@ 3@@ ; , there are only 1@@ 2 tu@@ b@@ es with a di@@ a@@ me@@ ter of 1@@ 2@@ 0 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters , or four fe@@ et , wi@@ de ."
"A@@ s you see it in the ph@@ o@@ to , in@@ side is the to@@ il@@ et ."
"In ca@@ se you &apos;re fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ed with to@@ il@@ et p@@ ap@@ er , you can te@@ ar off the in@@ side of the w@@ all . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very us@@ e@@ ful ."
"Y@@ e@@ ar 2@@ 000 , there was a big exp@@ o in G@@ er@@ many ."
"I was as@@ ked to design the buil@@ ding , because the the@@ me of the exp@@ o was en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ent@@ al is@@ su@@ es ."
"So I was ch@@ os@@ en to buil@@ d the pa@@ vi@@ lion out of p@@ ap@@ er tu@@ b@@ es , rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able p@@ ap@@ er ."
M@@ y go@@ al of the design is not when it &apos;s comple@@ ted .
"M@@ y go@@ al was when the buil@@ ding was de@@ mo@@ li@@ sh@@ ed , because each country ma@@ kes a lot of pa@@ vi@@ li@@ ons but after hal@@ f a year , we create a lot of in@@ du@@ stri@@ al wa@@ st@@ e , so my buil@@ ding has to be re@@ used or rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
"A@@ f@@ ter , the buil@@ ding was rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
So that was the go@@ al of my design .
Th@@ en I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to w@@ in the com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion to buil@@ d the second P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in Fr@@ ance in the city of M@@ et@@ z .
"@@ Because I was so po@@ or , I wanted to r@@ ent an off@@ ice in P@@ ar@@ is , but I cou@@ ldn &apos;t a@@ ff@@ or@@ d it , so I deci@@ ded to br@@ ing my stu@@ d@@ ents to P@@ ar@@ is to buil@@ d our off@@ ice on to@@ p of the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in P@@ ar@@ is by our@@ selves ."
So we br@@ ou@@ ght the p@@ ap@@ er tu@@ b@@ es and the w@@ oo@@ d@@ en jo@@ in@@ ts to comple@@ te the 35@@ -@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ long off@@ ice .
We st@@ ay@@ ed there for si@@ x years with@@ out p@@ ay@@ ing any r@@ ent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
"@@ Because we were part of the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion , even if my fri@@ end wanted to see me , they had to bu@@ y a tic@@ k@@ et to see me ."
That was the problem .
Th@@ en I comple@@ ted the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in M@@ et@@ z .
"It &apos;s a very p@@ op@@ ular mus@@ eu@@ m now , and I cre@@ ated a big mon@@ um@@ ent for the gover@@ n@@ ment ."
"But then I was very dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ted at my pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion as an ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect , because we are not hel@@ p@@ ing , we are not working for soci@@ e@@ ty , but we are working for pri@@ v@@ il@@ eg@@ ed people , ri@@ ch people , gover@@ n@@ ment , develop@@ ers ."
They have money and power .
Th@@ ose are in@@ vi@@ sible .
So they h@@ ir@@ e us to vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e their power and money by making mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture .
"That is our pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion , even hi@@ stor@@ ically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same ."
"So I was very dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ted that we are not working for soci@@ e@@ ty , even th@@ ough there are so many people who l@@ ost their h@@ ous@@ es by nat@@ ur@@ al di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers ."
But I m@@ ust say they are no l@@ on@@ ger nat@@ ur@@ al di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers .
"F@@ or example , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ kes never k@@ ill people , but coll@@ ap@@ se of the buil@@ d@@ ings k@@ ill people ."
That &apos;s the resp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ ility of ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ects .
"Th@@ en people need some te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing , but there are no ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ects working there because we are too bus@@ y working for pri@@ v@@ il@@ eg@@ ed people ."
"So I thought , even as ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ects , we can be inv@@ ol@@ ved in the re@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing ."
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in di@@ sa@@ ster are@@ as .
"@@ 19@@ 9@@ 4 , there was a big di@@ sa@@ ster in R@@ w@@ and@@ a , Afri@@ c@@ a ."
"T@@ w@@ o tri@@ b@@ es , H@@ ut@@ u and T@@ ut@@ s@@ i , f@@ ou@@ ght each other ."
O@@ ver two million people be@@ came re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
"But I was so sur@@ pri@@ s@@ ed to see the sh@@ el@@ ter , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ca@@ m@@ p organ@@ iz@@ ed by the U.@@ N@@ ."
"They &apos;re so po@@ or , and they are f@@ re@@ e@@ zing with bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ts d@@ ur@@ ing the ra@@ in@@ y se@@ as@@ on , I@@ n the sh@@ el@@ ters buil@@ t by the U.@@ N@@ . , they were just pro@@ vi@@ ding a pl@@ as@@ tic sh@@ e@@ et , and the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es had to c@@ ut the tre@@ es , and just like this ."
But over two million people c@@ ut tre@@ es .
"It just be@@ came big , he@@ av@@ y de@@ fo@@ re@@ st@@ ation and an en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ent@@ al problem ."
"That is why they started pro@@ vi@@ ding al@@ um@@ in@@ um pi@@ p@@ es , al@@ um@@ in@@ um b@@ ar@@ r@@ ac@@ ks ."
"V@@ er@@ y exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve , they th@@ ro@@ w them out for money , then c@@ ut@@ ting tre@@ es again ."
"So I pro@@ pos@@ ed my idea to im@@ pro@@ ve the s@@ it@@ u@@ ation using these rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed p@@ ap@@ er tu@@ b@@ es because this is so ch@@ ea@@ p and also so str@@ ong , but my bu@@ d@@ get is only 5@@ 0 U.@@ S@@ . doll@@ ars p@@ er un@@ it ."
"We buil@@ t 5@@ 0 un@@ its to do that as a mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing t@@ est for the d@@ ur@@ ab@@ ility and mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure and ter@@ m@@ it@@ es , so on ."
"And then , year af@@ ter@@ w@@ ard , 19@@ 9@@ 5 , in K@@ o@@ be , J@@ ap@@ an , we had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke ."
"N@@ ear@@ ly 7@@ ,000 people were k@@ ill@@ ed , and the city like this N@@ ag@@ at@@ a di@@ stri@@ c@@ t , all the city was b@@ ur@@ ned in a fir@@ e after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke ."
And also I found out there &apos;s many V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am@@ ese re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing and ga@@ ther@@ ing at a Ca@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c ch@@ ur@@ ch — all the buil@@ ding was t@@ ot@@ ally de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed .
"So I went there and also I pro@@ pos@@ ed to the pri@@ est@@ s , &quot; Wh@@ y don &apos;t we re@@ buil@@ d the ch@@ ur@@ ch out of p@@ ap@@ er tu@@ b@@ es ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; O@@ h G@@ od , are you c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ?"
"A@@ f@@ ter a fir@@ e , what are you pro@@ pos@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; So he never tr@@ u@@ st@@ ed me , but I didn &apos;t give up ."
"I started comm@@ u@@ ting to K@@ o@@ be , and I me@@ t the soci@@ e@@ ty of V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am@@ ese people ."
They were li@@ ving like this with very po@@ or pl@@ as@@ tic sh@@ e@@ e@@ ts in the par@@ k .
So I pro@@ pos@@ ed to re@@ buil@@ d . I ra@@ is@@ ed — did f@@ und@@ ra@@ is@@ ing .
"I made a p@@ ap@@ er tu@@ be sh@@ el@@ ter for them , and in or@@ der to make it e@@ as@@ y to be buil@@ t by stu@@ d@@ ents and also e@@ as@@ y to de@@ mo@@ li@@ s@@ h , I used be@@ er cr@@ ates as a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
"I as@@ ked the K@@ ir@@ in be@@ er comp@@ any to pro@@ p@@ ose , because at that time , the A@@ sa@@ h@@ i be@@ er comp@@ any made their pl@@ as@@ tic be@@ er cr@@ ates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the col@@ or of the p@@ ap@@ er tu@@ b@@ es ."
The col@@ or co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation is very important .
"And also I still re@@ memb@@ er , we were exp@@ ec@@ ting to have a be@@ er in@@ side the pl@@ as@@ tic be@@ er cr@@ ate , but it came e@@ mp@@ ty . ( Laughter ) So I re@@ memb@@ er it was so dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ting ."
"So d@@ ur@@ ing the su@@ mm@@ er with my stu@@ d@@ ents , we buil@@ t over 5@@ 0 un@@ its of the sh@@ el@@ ters ."
"F@@ in@@ ally the pri@@ est , fin@@ ally he tr@@ u@@ st@@ ed me to re@@ buil@@ d ."
"H@@ e said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you coll@@ ect money by y@@ our@@ self , br@@ ing your stu@@ d@@ ents to buil@@ d , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we sp@@ ent fi@@ ve we@@ e@@ ks re@@ buil@@ ding the ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"It was me@@ ant to st@@ ay there for three years , but actually it st@@ ay@@ ed there 10 years because people lo@@ ved it ."
"Th@@ en , in Ta@@ i@@ w@@ an , they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , and we pro@@ pos@@ ed to d@@ on@@ ate this ch@@ ur@@ ch , so we di@@ sm@@ an@@ tl@@ ed them , we s@@ ent them over to be buil@@ t by v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er people ."
It st@@ ay@@ ed there in Ta@@ i@@ w@@ an as a per@@ man@@ ent ch@@ ur@@ ch even now .
So this buil@@ ding be@@ came a per@@ man@@ ent buil@@ ding .
"Th@@ en I w@@ on@@ der , what is a per@@ man@@ ent and what is a te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary buil@@ ding ?"
E@@ ven a buil@@ ding made in p@@ ap@@ er can be per@@ man@@ ent as long as people love it .
E@@ ven a con@@ cre@@ te buil@@ ding can be very te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary if that is made to make money .
"In 19@@ 9@@ 9 , in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey , the big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , I went there to use the lo@@ cal mat@@ eri@@ al to buil@@ d a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"@@ 2@@ 00@@ 1 , in W@@ est In@@ di@@ a , I buil@@ t also a sh@@ el@@ ter ."

I was as@@ ked to re@@ buil@@ d the te@@ mp@@ or@@ ary ch@@ ur@@ ch .
I br@@ ou@@ ght my J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese stu@@ d@@ ents to work with the Ch@@ in@@ ese stu@@ d@@ ents .
"In one mon@@ th , we comple@@ ted n@@ ine cl@@ as@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s , over 50@@ 0 s@@ qu@@ are me@@ ters ."

"Y@@ e@@ ar 20@@ 10 in Ha@@ it@@ i , there was a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , but it &apos;s imp@@ os@@ sible to f@@ ly over , so I went to S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go , ne@@ x@@ t-@@ do@@ or country , to dri@@ ve si@@ x h@@ our@@ s to get to Ha@@ it@@ i with the lo@@ cal stu@@ d@@ ents in S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go to buil@@ d 5@@ 0 un@@ its of sh@@ el@@ ter out of lo@@ cal p@@ ap@@ er tu@@ b@@ es ."
"This is what happened in J@@ ap@@ an two years ago , in n@@ or@@ ther@@ n J@@ ap@@ an ."
"A@@ f@@ ter the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke and t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i , people had to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated in a big room like a gy@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ i@@ um ."
But look at this . There &apos;s no pri@@ v@@ ac@@ y .
Pe@@ ople su@@ ff@@ er m@@ ent@@ ally and ph@@ ys@@ ically .
"So we went there to buil@@ d par@@ ti@@ tions with all the stu@@ d@@ ent v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with p@@ ap@@ er tu@@ b@@ es , just a very si@@ mple sh@@ el@@ ter out of the tu@@ be f@@ ra@@ me and the cur@@ ta@@ in ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , some of the fac@@ ility au@@ th@@ or@@ ity doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , si@@ mp@@ ly , it &apos;s become more diff@@ ic@@ ult to cont@@ ro@@ l them ."
But it &apos;s really nec@@ ess@@ ary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough fl@@ at are@@ a to buil@@ d st@@ and@@ ard gover@@ n@@ ment sing@@ le@@ -@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing like this one .
"L@@ oo@@ k at this .

What is going on in this b@@ ab@@ y &apos;s m@@ ind ?
"If you &apos;d as@@ ked people this 3@@ 0 years ago , most people , in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts , would have said that this b@@ ab@@ y was ir@@ ra@@ tional , il@@ logi@@ cal , e@@ go@@ c@@ ent@@ ri@@ c — that he cou@@ ldn &apos;t take the per@@ spec@@ tive of another person or understand cause and eff@@ ect ."
"In the last 2@@ 0 years , develop@@ m@@ ent@@ al sci@@ ence has comple@@ tely over@@ tur@@ ned that pic@@ ture ."
"So in some ways , we think that this b@@ ab@@ y &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most b@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant sci@@ enti@@ sts ."
L@@ et me give you just one example of this .
"O@@ n@@ e thing that this b@@ ab@@ y could be thinking about , that could be going on in his m@@ ind , is trying to fi@@ g@@ ure out what &apos;s going on in the m@@ ind of that other b@@ ab@@ y ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , one of the things that &apos;s h@@ ar@@ d@@ est for all of us to do is to fi@@ g@@ ure out what other people are thinking and fe@@ el@@ ing ."
And maybe the h@@ ar@@ d@@ est thing of all is to fi@@ g@@ ure out that what other people think and feel is@@ n &apos;t actually ex@@ ac@@ tly like what we think and feel .
An@@ y@@ one who &apos;s f@@ ol@@ low@@ ed poli@@ tic@@ s can t@@ es@@ ti@@ f@@ y to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if b@@ ab@@ ies and y@@ oun@@ g children could understand this really pro@@ found thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we as@@ k them ?
"B@@ ab@@ ies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you as@@ k a three ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old to tell you what he thin@@ ks , what you &apos;ll get is a be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful st@@ re@@ am of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess mon@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ e about p@@ on@@ ies and b@@ ir@@ th@@ d@@ ays and things like that ."
So how do we actually as@@ k them the question ?
W@@ ell it tur@@ ns out that the sec@@ re@@ t was b@@ ro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
"Wh@@ at we did — Be@@ t@@ ty R@@ ap@@ ach@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my stu@@ d@@ ents , and I — was actually to give the b@@ ab@@ ies two bo@@ wl@@ s of food : one bo@@ w@@ l of ra@@ w b@@ ro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bo@@ w@@ l of de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous go@@ l@@ d@@ f@@ ish cr@@ ac@@ k@@ ers ."
"Now all of the b@@ ab@@ ies , even in B@@ er@@ k@@ le@@ y , like the cr@@ ac@@ k@@ ers and don &apos;t like the ra@@ w b@@ ro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
( Laughter ) But then what Be@@ t@@ ty did was to take a little ta@@ st@@ e of food from each bo@@ w@@ l .
And she would act as if she li@@ ked it or she didn &apos;t .
"So hal@@ f the time , she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the cr@@ ac@@ k@@ ers and didn &apos;t like the b@@ ro@@ c@@ col@@ i — just like a b@@ ab@@ y and any other s@@ an@@ e person ."
"But hal@@ f the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the b@@ ro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ mm@@ m@@ m , b@@ ro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"I ta@@ st@@ ed the b@@ ro@@ c@@ col@@ i . M@@ mm@@ m@@ m . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the cr@@ ac@@ k@@ ers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uc@@ k , cr@@ ac@@ k@@ ers ."
"I ta@@ st@@ ed the cr@@ ac@@ k@@ ers . E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uc@@ k . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the op@@ pos@@ ite of what the b@@ ab@@ ies wanted ."
We did this with 1@@ 5 and 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old b@@ ab@@ ies .
"And then she would si@@ mp@@ ly put her h@@ and out and say , &quot; C@@ an you give me some ? &quot;"
"So the question is : What would the b@@ ab@@ y give her , what they li@@ ked or what she li@@ ked ?"
"And the re@@ mar@@ k@@ able thing was that 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old b@@ ab@@ ies , just b@@ ar@@ ely wal@@ king and tal@@ king , would give her the cr@@ ac@@ k@@ ers if she li@@ ked the cr@@ ac@@ k@@ ers , but they would give her the b@@ ro@@ c@@ col@@ i if she li@@ ked the b@@ ro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"O@@ n the other h@@ and , 1@@ 5 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds would st@@ are at her for a long time if she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the b@@ ro@@ c@@ col@@ i , like they cou@@ ldn &apos;t fi@@ g@@ ure this out ."
"But then after they star@@ ed for a long time , they would just give her the cr@@ ac@@ k@@ ers , what they thought every@@ body m@@ ust like ."
So there are two really re@@ mar@@ k@@ able things about this .
"The first one is that these little 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old b@@ ab@@ ies have al@@ ready disc@@ over@@ ed this really pro@@ found fact about human nat@@ ure , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing ."
"And what &apos;s more , they f@@ el@@ t that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted ."
"E@@ ven more re@@ mar@@ k@@ ably th@@ ough , the fact that 1@@ 5 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds didn &apos;t do this su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts that these 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds had lear@@ ned this de@@ ep , pro@@ found fact about human nat@@ ure in the three mon@@ ths from when they were 1@@ 5 mon@@ ths old ."
So children bot@@ h know more and lear@@ n more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of h@@ und@@ re@@ ds and h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of stu@@ di@@ es over the last 2@@ 0 years that &apos;s actually de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated it .
The question you might as@@ k th@@ ough is : Wh@@ y do children lear@@ n so much ?
And how is it pos@@ sible for them to lear@@ n so much in s@@ uch a sh@@ ort time ?
"I mean , after all , if you look at b@@ ab@@ ies su@@ per@@ f@@ ici@@ ally , they see@@ m pret@@ ty us@@ el@@ ess ."
"And actually in many ways , they &apos;re wor@@ se than us@@ el@@ ess , because we have to put so much time and energy into just ke@@ ep@@ ing them ali@@ ve ."
"But if we tur@@ n to ev@@ ol@@ ution for an an@@ sw@@ er to this pu@@ zz@@ le of why we sp@@ end so much time ta@@ king c@@ are of us@@ el@@ ess b@@ ab@@ ies , it tur@@ ns out that there &apos;s actually an an@@ sw@@ er ."
"If we look ac@@ r@@ oss many , many different spec@@ ies of an@@ im@@ als , not just us pri@@ mat@@ es , but also in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding other ma@@ mm@@ als , b@@ ir@@ ds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like k@@ an@@ g@@ ar@@ oo@@ s and wom@@ b@@ at@@ s , it tur@@ ns out that there &apos;s a re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p between how long a chil@@ dh@@ ood a spec@@ ies has and how big their bra@@ ins are com@@ par@@ ed to their bo@@ di@@ es and how sm@@ art and f@@ le@@ xi@@ ble they are ."
And sort of the pos@@ ter@@ b@@ ir@@ ds for this idea are the b@@ ir@@ ds up there .
O@@ n one side is a Ne@@ w C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ i@@ an c@@ ro@@ w .
"And c@@ ro@@ ws and other cor@@ vi@@ da@@ e , ra@@ v@@ en@@ s , ro@@ o@@ ks and so for@@ th , are incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly sm@@ art b@@ ir@@ ds ."
They &apos;re as sm@@ art as ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es in some re@@ spec@@ ts .
And this is a b@@ ir@@ d on the co@@ ver of sci@@ ence who &apos;s lear@@ ned how to use a to@@ o@@ l to get food .
"O@@ n the other h@@ and , we have our fri@@ end the d@@ om@@ es@@ tic ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en ."
And ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en@@ s and duc@@ ks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ ke@@ ys are bas@@ ically as d@@ um@@ b as du@@ mp@@ s .
"So they &apos;re very , very good at p@@ ec@@ king for gra@@ in , and they &apos;re not much good at doing any@@ thing el@@ se ."
"Well it tur@@ ns out that the b@@ ab@@ ies , the Ne@@ w C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ i@@ an c@@ ro@@ w b@@ ab@@ ies , are f@@ le@@ d@@ gl@@ ings ."
"They de@@ p@@ end on their mom@@ s to d@@ ro@@ p wor@@ ms in their little op@@ en m@@ ou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a b@@ ir@@ d ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en@@ s are actually mat@@ ure with@@ in a cou@@ ple of mon@@ ths .
So chil@@ dh@@ ood is the reas@@ on why the c@@ ro@@ ws end up on the co@@ ver of S@@ ci@@ ence and the ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en@@ s end up in the s@@ ou@@ p po@@ t .
There &apos;s something about that long chil@@ dh@@ ood that se@@ ems to be con@@ nec@@ ted to kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge and lear@@ ning .
W@@ ell what kind of ex@@ plan@@ ation could we have for this ?
"Well some an@@ im@@ als , like the ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en , see@@ m to be be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful@@ ly su@@ ited to doing just one thing very well ."
So they see@@ m to be be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful@@ ly su@@ ited to p@@ ec@@ king gra@@ in in one en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
"O@@ ther cre@@ at@@ u@@ res , like the c@@ ro@@ ws , ar@@ en &apos;t very good at doing any@@ thing in par@@ tic@@ ular , but they &apos;re ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly good at lear@@ ning about la@@ ws of different en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ents ."
"And of course , we human be@@ ings are way out on the end of the di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion like the c@@ ro@@ ws ."
We have bi@@ gg@@ er bra@@ ins re@@ la@@ tive to our bo@@ di@@ es by f@@ ar than any other an@@ ima@@ l .
"We &apos;re sm@@ ar@@ ter , we &apos;re more f@@ le@@ xi@@ ble , we can lear@@ n more , we sur@@ vi@@ ve in more different en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ents , we mi@@ gr@@ ated to co@@ ver the world and even go to ou@@ ter space ."
And our b@@ ab@@ ies and children are de@@ p@@ end@@ ent on us for much l@@ on@@ ger than the b@@ ab@@ ies of any other spec@@ ies .
M@@ y son is 2@@ 3 .
"( Laughter ) And at le@@ ast un@@ ti@@ l they &apos;re 2@@ 3 , we &apos;re still p@@ opp@@ ing those wor@@ ms into those little op@@ en m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"A@@ ll right , why would we see this cor@@ re@@ l@@ ation ?"
"Well an idea is that that str@@ at@@ e@@ gy , that lear@@ ning str@@ at@@ e@@ gy , is an ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly pow@@ er@@ ful , great str@@ at@@ e@@ gy for getting on in the world , but it has one big di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ age ."
"And that one big di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ age is that , un@@ ti@@ l you actually do all that lear@@ ning , you &apos;re going to be hel@@ pl@@ ess ."
"So you don &apos;t want to have the ma@@ st@@ o@@ don ch@@ ar@@ ging at you and be sa@@ ying to y@@ our@@ self , &quot; A sl@@ ing@@ sh@@ o@@ t or maybe a spe@@ ar might work . Wh@@ ich would actually be better ? &quot;"
You want to know all that before the ma@@ st@@ o@@ d@@ ons actually show up .
And the way the ev@@ ol@@ u@@ tions se@@ ems to have sol@@ ved that problem is with a kind of di@@ vi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or .
So the idea is that we have this ear@@ ly per@@ i@@ od when we &apos;re comple@@ tely prot@@ ec@@ ted .
We don &apos;t have to do any@@ thing . A@@ ll we have to do is lear@@ n .
"And then as ad@@ ul@@ ts , we can take all those things that we lear@@ ned when we were b@@ ab@@ ies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world ."
So one way of thinking about it is that b@@ ab@@ ies and y@@ oun@@ g children are like the re@@ sear@@ ch and develop@@ ment di@@ vi@@ sion of the human spec@@ ies .
"So they &apos;re the prot@@ ec@@ ted bl@@ ue sk@@ y gu@@ ys who just have to go out and lear@@ n and have good ide@@ as , and we &apos;re produc@@ tion and mar@@ ke@@ ting ."
We have to take all those ide@@ as that we lear@@ ned when we were children and actually put them to use .
"A@@ no@@ ther way of thinking about it is in@@ ste@@ ad of thinking of b@@ ab@@ ies and children as being like de@@ f@@ ec@@ tive gro@@ wn@@ up@@ s , we should think about them as being a different develop@@ m@@ ent@@ al st@@ age of the same spec@@ ies — kind of like ca@@ ter@@ p@@ ill@@ ars and bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es — ex@@ cep@@ t that they &apos;re actually the b@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es who are f@@ lit@@ ting around the g@@ ar@@ d@@ en and ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing , and we &apos;re the ca@@ ter@@ p@@ ill@@ ars who are in@@ ch@@ ing al@@ ong our n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w , gro@@ wn@@ up , ad@@ ult p@@ ath ."
"If this is tr@@ ue , if these b@@ ab@@ ies are desig@@ ned to lear@@ n — and this ev@@ ol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary story would say children are for lear@@ ning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might exp@@ ect that they would have really pow@@ er@@ ful lear@@ ning m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ ms ."
"And in fact , the b@@ ab@@ y &apos;s brain se@@ ems to be the most pow@@ er@@ ful lear@@ ning compu@@ ter on the plan@@ et ."
But real compu@@ ters are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution in our underst@@ an@@ ding of m@@ ach@@ ine lear@@ ning rec@@ ently .
"And it all de@@ p@@ en@@ ds on the ide@@ as of this gu@@ y , the Re@@ ver@@ end Th@@ om@@ as B@@ ay@@ es , who was a sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ an and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ ci@@ an in the 18@@ th c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y ."
"And ess@@ enti@@ ally what B@@ ay@@ es did was to pro@@ vi@@ de a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical way using prob@@ ab@@ ility the@@ ory to ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ iz@@ e , des@@ cri@@ be , the way that sci@@ enti@@ sts find out about the world ."
So what sci@@ enti@@ sts do is they have a hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is that they think might be li@@ ke@@ ly to start with .
They go out and t@@ est it aga@@ in@@ st the e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence .
The e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence ma@@ kes them change that hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is .
Th@@ en they t@@ est that new hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is and so on and so for@@ th .
And what B@@ ay@@ es show@@ ed was a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical way that you could do that .
And that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tic@@ s is at the c@@ ore of the best m@@ ach@@ ine lear@@ ning pro@@ gra@@ ms that we have now .
"And some 10 years ago , I su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ed that b@@ ab@@ ies might be doing the same thing ."
"So if you want to know what &apos;s going on under@@ ne@@ ath those be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful b@@ ro@@ wn ey@@ es , I think it actually loo@@ ks something like this ."
This is Re@@ ver@@ end B@@ ay@@ es &apos;s n@@ ot@@ e@@ book .
So I think those b@@ ab@@ ies are actually making comp@@ li@@ ca@@ ted c@@ al@@ cul@@ ations with con@@ di@@ tional prob@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties that they &apos;re re@@ vi@@ sing to fi@@ g@@ ure out how the world wor@@ ks .
"A@@ ll right , now that might see@@ m like an even t@@ all@@ er or@@ der to actually de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate ."
"@@ Because after all , if you as@@ k even gro@@ wn@@ up@@ s about sta@@ ti@@ s@@ tic@@ s , they look ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly stu@@ p@@ id ."
How could it be that children are doing sta@@ ti@@ s@@ tic@@ s ?
So to t@@ est this we used a m@@ ach@@ ine that we have called the B@@ li@@ ck@@ et D@@ et@@ ec@@ t@@ or .
This is a bo@@ x that li@@ gh@@ ts up and pl@@ ays mus@@ ic when you put some things on it and not o@@ th@@ ers .
"And using this very si@@ mple m@@ ach@@ ine , my la@@ b and o@@ th@@ ers have done do@@ z@@ en@@ s of stu@@ di@@ es show@@ ing just how good b@@ ab@@ ies are at lear@@ ning about the world ."
"L@@ et me m@@ en@@ tion just one that we did with Tu@@ ma@@ r K@@ us@@ h@@ n@@ er , my stu@@ d@@ ent ."
"If I show@@ ed you this de@@ t@@ ec@@ t@@ or , you would be li@@ ke@@ ly to think to be@@ g@@ in with that the way to make the de@@ t@@ ec@@ t@@ or go would be to put a b@@ lo@@ c@@ k on to@@ p of the de@@ t@@ ec@@ t@@ or ."
"But actually , this de@@ t@@ ec@@ t@@ or wor@@ ks in a bit of a str@@ an@@ ge way ."
"@@ Because if you wa@@ ve a b@@ lo@@ c@@ k over the to@@ p of the de@@ t@@ ec@@ t@@ or , something you w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t ever think of to be@@ g@@ in with , the de@@ t@@ ec@@ t@@ or will actually ac@@ tiv@@ ate two out of three times ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as , if you do the li@@ ke@@ ly thing , put the b@@ lo@@ c@@ k on the de@@ t@@ ec@@ t@@ or , it will only ac@@ tiv@@ ate two out of si@@ x times ."
So the un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is actually has str@@ on@@ ger e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence .
It loo@@ ks as if the wa@@ ving is a more eff@@ ec@@ tive str@@ at@@ e@@ gy than the other str@@ at@@ e@@ gy .
"So we did just this ; we ga@@ ve four ye@@ ar@@ -@@ ol@@ ds this p@@ at@@ ter@@ n of e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence , and we just as@@ ked them to make it go ."
"And s@@ ure enough , the four ye@@ ar@@ -@@ ol@@ ds used the e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence to wa@@ ve the ob@@ j@@ ect on to@@ p of the de@@ t@@ ec@@ t@@ or ."
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
"The first one is , again , re@@ memb@@ er , these are four ye@@ ar@@ -@@ ol@@ ds ."
They &apos;re just lear@@ ning how to coun@@ t .
"But un@@ con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ly , they &apos;re doing these quite comp@@ li@@ ca@@ ted c@@ al@@ cul@@ ations that will give them a con@@ di@@ tional prob@@ ab@@ ility me@@ as@@ ure ."
"And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence to get to an idea , get to a hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is about the world , that se@@ ems very un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly to be@@ g@@ in with ."
"And in stu@@ di@@ es we &apos;ve just been doing in my la@@ b , si@@ mil@@ ar stu@@ di@@ es , we &apos;ve show that four ye@@ ar@@ -@@ ol@@ ds are actually better at fin@@ ding out an un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is than ad@@ ul@@ ts are when we give them ex@@ ac@@ tly the same t@@ as@@ k ."
"So in these c@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ an@@ ces , the children are using sta@@ ti@@ s@@ tic@@ s to find out about the world , but after all , sci@@ enti@@ sts also do exper@@ im@@ ents , and we wanted to see if children are doing exper@@ im@@ ents ."
Wh@@ en children do exper@@ im@@ ents we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or el@@ se &quot; &quot; pl@@ ay@@ ing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a b@@ un@@ ch of interesting stu@@ di@@ es rec@@ ently that have sh@@ own this pl@@ ay@@ ing around is really a kind of exper@@ im@@ ent@@ al re@@ sear@@ ch pro@@ gra@@ m .
H@@ ere &apos;s one from C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine L@@ eg@@ are &apos;s la@@ b .
What C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine did was use our B@@ li@@ ck@@ et D@@ et@@ ec@@ t@@ ors .
"And what she did was show children that y@@ el@@ low ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she show@@ ed them an an@@ om@@ al@@ y ."
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little bo@@ y will go through fi@@ ve hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses in the space of two min@@ ut@@ es .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) Bo@@ y : How about this ?
Sa@@ me as the other side .
"A@@ li@@ son G@@ op@@ ni@@ k : Ok@@ ay , so his first hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is has just been f@@ al@@ si@@ fi@@ ed ."
"( Laughter ) Bo@@ y : This one li@@ gh@@ ted up , and this one no@@ thing ."
"A@@ G : Ok@@ ay , he &apos;s got his exper@@ im@@ ent@@ al n@@ ot@@ e@@ book out ."
Bo@@ y : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
A@@ G : E@@ very sci@@ enti@@ st will re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e that ex@@ pres@@ sion of des@@ pa@@ ir .
"( Laughter ) Bo@@ y : O@@ h , it &apos;s because this nee@@ ds to be like this , and this nee@@ ds to be like this ."
"A@@ G : Ok@@ ay , hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is two ."
Bo@@ y : That &apos;s why .
O@@ h .
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Now this is his next idea .
"H@@ e to@@ ld the exper@@ im@@ en@@ ter to do this , to try p@@ ut@@ ting it out on@@ to the other lo@@ cation ."
No@@ t working ei@@ ther .
"B@@ o@@ y : O@@ h , because the light go@@ es only to here , not here ."
"O@@ h , the bot@@ to@@ m of this bo@@ x has elec@@ tri@@ city in here , but this doesn &apos;t have elec@@ tri@@ city ."
"A@@ G : Ok@@ ay , that &apos;s a f@@ our@@ th hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is ."
Bo@@ y : It &apos;s li@@ gh@@ ting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
"A@@ G : Ok@@ ay , there &apos;s his fi@@ f@@ th hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is ."
"Now that is a par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly — that is a par@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly ad@@ or@@ able and ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ate little bo@@ y , but what C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine disc@@ over@@ ed is this is actually quite ty@@ pi@@ cal ."
"If you look at the way children pl@@ ay , when you as@@ k them to ex@@ pla@@ in something , what they really do is do a ser@@ ies of exper@@ im@@ ents ."
This is actually pret@@ ty ty@@ pi@@ cal of four ye@@ ar@@ -@@ ol@@ ds .
"Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of cre@@ at@@ ure ?"
What &apos;s it like to be one of these b@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es who can t@@ est fi@@ ve hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses in two min@@ ut@@ es ?
"Well , if you go back to those p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts and ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ers , a lot of them have said that b@@ ab@@ ies and y@@ oun@@ g children were b@@ ar@@ ely con@@ sci@@ ous if they were con@@ sci@@ ous at all ."
And I think just the op@@ pos@@ ite is tr@@ ue .
I think b@@ ab@@ ies and children are actually more con@@ sci@@ ous than we are as ad@@ ul@@ ts .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how ad@@ ult con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess wor@@ ks .
And ad@@ ul@@ ts &apos; at@@ ten@@ tion and con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess look kind of like a sp@@ ot@@ light .
"So what happen@@ s for ad@@ ul@@ ts is we deci@@ de that something &apos;s re@@ le@@ v@@ ant or important , we should p@@ ay at@@ ten@@ tion to it ."
"O@@ u@@ r con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess of that thing that we &apos;re at@@ ten@@ ding to be@@ comes ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly b@@ right and vi@@ vi@@ d , and everything el@@ se sort of go@@ es d@@ ar@@ k ."
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
"So what happen@@ s when we p@@ ay at@@ ten@@ tion is that the pre@@ fr@@ on@@ t@@ al cor@@ te@@ x , the sort of ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive part of our bra@@ ins , sen@@ ds a si@@ gn@@ al that ma@@ kes a little part of our brain much more f@@ le@@ xi@@ ble , more pl@@ as@@ tic , better at lear@@ ning , and sh@@ u@@ ts down ac@@ tiv@@ ity in all the re@@ st of our bra@@ ins ."
"So we have a very fo@@ c@@ used , p@@ ur@@ pos@@ e-@@ dri@@ ven kind of at@@ ten@@ tion ."
"If we look at b@@ ab@@ ies and y@@ oun@@ g children , we see something very different ."
I think b@@ ab@@ ies and y@@ oun@@ g children see@@ m to have more of a l@@ an@@ ter@@ n of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess than a sp@@ ot@@ light of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess .
So b@@ ab@@ ies and y@@ oun@@ g children are very b@@ ad at n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w@@ ing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at ta@@ king in l@@ ots of information from l@@ ots of different s@@ our@@ ces at on@@ ce .
"And if you actually look in their bra@@ ins , you see that they &apos;re f@@ loo@@ ded with these ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ r@@ an@@ sm@@ it@@ ters that are really good at in@@ duc@@ ing lear@@ ning and pl@@ as@@ tic@@ ity , and the in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ory par@@ ts ha@@ ven &apos;t come on ye@@ t ."
"So when we say that b@@ ab@@ ies and y@@ oun@@ g children are b@@ ad at p@@ ay@@ ing at@@ ten@@ tion , what we really mean is that they &apos;re b@@ ad at not p@@ ay@@ ing at@@ ten@@ tion ."
So they &apos;re b@@ ad at getting ri@@ d of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
"That &apos;s the kind of at@@ ten@@ tion , the kind of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess , that we might exp@@ ect from those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es who are desig@@ ned to lear@@ n ."
"Well if we want to think about a way of getting a ta@@ st@@ e of that kind of b@@ ab@@ y con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess as ad@@ ul@@ ts , I think the best thing is think about ca@@ ses where we &apos;re put in a new s@@ it@@ u@@ ation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we f@@ all in love with some@@ one new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time ."
"And what happen@@ s then is not that our con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess con@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts , it exp@@ ands , so that those three d@@ ays in P@@ ar@@ is see@@ m to be more ful@@ l of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess and experi@@ ence than all the mon@@ ths of being a wal@@ king , tal@@ king , fac@@ ul@@ ty me@@ et@@ ing@@ -@@ at@@ ten@@ ding z@@ om@@ bi@@ e back home ."
"And by the way , that co@@ ff@@ e@@ e , that w@@ on@@ der@@ ful co@@ ff@@ e@@ e you &apos;ve been dr@@ in@@ king do@@ wn@@ sta@@ ir@@ s , actually mi@@ m@@ ic@@ s the eff@@ ect of those b@@ ab@@ y ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ r@@ an@@ sm@@ it@@ ters ."
So what &apos;s it like to be a b@@ ab@@ y ?
It &apos;s like being in love in P@@ ar@@ is for the first time after you &apos;ve had three d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ es@@ pres@@ so@@ s .
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic way to be , but it does t@@ end to lea@@ ve you wa@@ king up cr@@ ying at three o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ c@@ k in the mor@@ ning . ( Laughter )@@ "
Now it &apos;s good to be a gro@@ wn@@ up .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how w@@ on@@ der@@ ful b@@ ab@@ ies are .
It &apos;s good to be a gro@@ wn@@ up .
We can do things like ti@@ e our sh@@ o@@ el@@ ac@@ es and cr@@ oss the st@@ re@@ et by our@@ selves .
And it ma@@ kes sense that we put a lot of eff@@ ort into making b@@ ab@@ ies think like ad@@ ul@@ ts do .
"But if what we want is to be like those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es , to have op@@ en@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ dn@@ ess , op@@ en lear@@ ning , ima@@ gin@@ ation , cre@@ a@@ tiv@@ ity , in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , maybe at le@@ ast some of the time we should be getting the ad@@ ul@@ ts to start thinking more like children ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to sh@@ are with you the story as to how I have become an HI@@ V / A@@ ID@@ S ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n@@ er .
And this is the na@@ me of my ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n : S@@ IN@@ G Ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n .
"In No@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er of 2@@ 00@@ 3 , I was inv@@ ited to take part in the la@@ un@@ ch of N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ el@@ a &apos;s 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation — that is his HI@@ V / A@@ ID@@ S f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
And 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 is the number that M@@ and@@ el@@ a had when he was imp@@ ri@@ s@@ on@@ ed in R@@ ob@@ be@@ n I@@ sl@@ and .
"And that &apos;s me with Y@@ ous@@ s@@ ou N &apos;@@ D@@ our , on@@ st@@ age , ha@@ ving the time of my life ."
"The next day , all the ar@@ ti@@ sts were inv@@ ited to jo@@ in M@@ and@@ el@@ a in R@@ ob@@ be@@ n I@@ sl@@ and , where he was going to give a con@@ f@@ er@@ ence to the world &apos;s pres@@ s , st@@ an@@ ding in fr@@ on@@ t of his form@@ er pri@@ son c@@ ell ."
You can see the b@@ ars of the w@@ in@@ d@@ ow there .
It was quite a mom@@ ent@@ ous oc@@ ca@@ sion for all of us .
"In that mom@@ ent in time , M@@ and@@ el@@ a to@@ ld the world &apos;s pres@@ s that there was a vir@@ tu@@ al gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de ta@@ king place in his country ; that pos@@ t-@@ ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id Ra@@ in@@ b@@ ow N@@ ation , a thou@@ s@@ and people were d@@ ying on a da@@ i@@ ly bas@@ is and that the fr@@ on@@ t line v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , the most v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able of all , were women and children ."
"This was a hu@@ ge imp@@ act on my m@@ ind , because I am a wom@@ an and I am a mo@@ ther , and I ha@@ dn &apos;t re@@ aliz@@ ed that the HI@@ V / A@@ ID@@ S p@@ an@@ de@@ mi@@ c was di@@ rec@@ tly a@@ ff@@ ec@@ ting women in s@@ uch a way ."
"And so I comm@@ it@@ ted — when I left S@@ ou@@ th Afri@@ c@@ a , when I left C@@ ap@@ e@@ to@@ wn , I to@@ ld my@@ self , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about ."
"I have to ser@@ ve . &quot; &quot; And so , su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ently I par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated in every sing@@ le 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent that I could take part in and ga@@ ve ne@@ ws con@@ f@@ er@@ en@@ ces , inter@@ vi@@ e@@ ws , tal@@ king and using my pl@@ at@@ form as a mus@@ ici@@ an , with my comm@@ it@@ ment to M@@ and@@ el@@ a — out of resp@@ ect for the tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous , un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able work that he had done ."
"E@@ very@@ one in the world re@@ spec@@ ts N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ el@@ a , every@@ one re@@ ver@@ es N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ el@@ a ."
"But do they all know about what has been ta@@ king place in S@@ ou@@ th Afri@@ c@@ a , his country , the country that had one of the high@@ est in@@ ci@@ d@@ ents of tran@@ sm@@ is@@ sion of the vir@@ us ?"
"I think that if I went out into the st@@ re@@ et now and I to@@ ld people what was happen@@ ing there , they would be sh@@ oc@@ ked ."
"I was very , very for@@ t@@ un@@ ate a cou@@ ple of years l@@ ater to have me@@ t Z@@ ac@@ ki@@ e A@@ ch@@ m@@ at , the f@@ oun@@ der of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment Ac@@ tion Ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n , an incre@@ di@@ ble ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n@@ er and ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st ."
I me@@ t him at a 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent .
He was we@@ ar@@ ing a t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t like the one I we@@ ar now .
"This is a to@@ o@@ l — this t@@ ells you I am in so@@ li@@ d@@ ar@@ ity with people who have HI@@ V , people who are li@@ ving with HI@@ V ."
"And in a way because of the sti@@ gm@@ a , by we@@ ar@@ ing this t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t I say , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , we can talk about this is@@ su@@ e ."
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the cl@@ os@@ et . &quot; &quot; I be@@ came a memb@@ er of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment Ac@@ tion Ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n and I &apos;m very pr@@ ou@@ d to be a memb@@ er of that incre@@ di@@ ble organ@@ iz@@ ation .
"It &apos;s a gr@@ as@@ s@@ ro@@ ots ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n with 8@@ 0 percent memb@@ er@@ shi@@ p being women , most of wh@@ om are HI@@ V@@ -@@ pos@@ i@@ tive ."
They work in the fi@@ el@@ d .
They have tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous ou@@ tre@@ ach to the people who are li@@ ving di@@ rec@@ tly with the eff@@ ects of the vir@@ us .
They have e@@ du@@ cation pro@@ gra@@ ms .
They br@@ ing out the is@@ su@@ es of sti@@ gm@@ a .
It &apos;s quite ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary what they do .
"And y@@ es , my S@@ IN@@ G Ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n has su@@ pp@@ or@@ ted T@@ re@@ at@@ ment Ac@@ tion Ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n in the way that I have tri@@ ed to ra@@ i@@ se aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess and to try to also ra@@ i@@ se f@@ un@@ ds ."
"@@ A lot of the f@@ und@@ ing that I have man@@ ag@@ ed to ra@@ i@@ se has g@@ one di@@ rec@@ tly to T@@ re@@ at@@ ment Ac@@ tion Ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n and the incre@@ di@@ ble work that they do , and are still cont@@ in@@ u@@ ing to do in S@@ ou@@ th Afri@@ c@@ a ."
So this is my S@@ IN@@ G Ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n .
S@@ IN@@ G Ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n is bas@@ ically just me and about three or four w@@ on@@ der@@ ful people who help to su@@ pp@@ ort me .
I &apos;ve tra@@ vel@@ ed all over the world in the last two and a hal@@ f years — I went to about 1@@ 2 different coun@@ tries .
"H@@ ere I am in O@@ sl@@ o in N@@ or@@ way , getting a n@@ ice , f@@ at ch@@ ec@@ k ; sing@@ ing in H@@ ong K@@ ong , trying to get people to ra@@ i@@ se money ."
"In Jo@@ h@@ an@@ n@@ es@@ b@@ ur@@ g , I had the opp@@ ort@@ unity to pl@@ ay to a ma@@ in@@ ly wh@@ ite , mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ cl@@ as@@ s S@@ ou@@ th Afri@@ can au@@ di@@ ence who en@@ ded up in te@@ ars because I use f@@ il@@ m cli@@ ps that really t@@ ou@@ ch the he@@ art , the whole nat@@ ure , of this ter@@ ri@@ ble tra@@ ge@@ dy that is ta@@ king place , that people are ten@@ ding to a@@ vo@@ id , because they are fa@@ ti@@ gu@@ ed , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the sol@@ u@@ tions are ."
"A@@ ar@@ on M@@ ot@@ so@@ al@@ ed@@ i , the cur@@ r@@ ent heal@@ th min@@ i@@ ster , at@@ ten@@ ded that con@@ cer@@ t and I had an opp@@ ort@@ unity to me@@ et with him , and he ga@@ ve his ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ e comm@@ it@@ ment to try to making a change , which is ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tely nec@@ ess@@ ary ."
This is in the S@@ c@@ ot@@ ti@@ s@@ h P@@ ar@@ li@@ am@@ ent .
I &apos;ve su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ently become an en@@ vo@@ y for S@@ c@@ ot@@ l@@ and and HI@@ V .
"And I was show@@ ing them my experi@@ en@@ ces and trying to , again , ra@@ i@@ se aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess ."
"And on@@ ce again , in E@@ d@@ in@@ b@@ ur@@ gh with the w@@ on@@ der@@ ful Afri@@ can Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s Ch@@ o@@ ir who I si@@ mp@@ ly ad@@ ore ."
"And it &apos;s children like this , many of wh@@ om have been or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed because of their fami@@ ly being a@@ ff@@ ec@@ ted by the A@@ ID@@ S vir@@ us ."
I &apos;m s@@ it@@ ting here in Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k with M@@ ic@@ he@@ l Si@@ di@@ be — he &apos;s the di@@ rec@@ t@@ or of UN@@ A@@ ID@@ S .
"And I &apos;m very h@@ on@@ o@@ red by the fact that M@@ ic@@ he@@ l inv@@ ited me , only a few mon@@ ths ago , to become a UN@@ A@@ ID@@ S am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"And in this way , I &apos;ve been str@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ing my pl@@ at@@ form and b@@ ro@@ ad@@ en@@ ing my ou@@ tre@@ ach ."
The m@@ ess@@ age that UN@@ A@@ ID@@ S are cur@@ r@@ ently sen@@ ding out to the world is that we would like to see the vir@@ tu@@ al e@@ li@@ min@@ ation of the tran@@ sm@@ is@@ sion of the vir@@ us from mo@@ ther to chil@@ d by 20@@ 1@@ 5 .
It &apos;s a very am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous go@@ al but we believe it can be ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ ed with poli@@ tical will .
This can happ@@ en .
"And here I am with a pre@@ gn@@ ant wom@@ an , who is HI@@ V pos@@ i@@ tive and we &apos;re sm@@ il@@ ing , bot@@ h of us are sm@@ il@@ ing , because we &apos;re very con@@ fi@@ d@@ ent , because we know that that y@@ oun@@ g wom@@ an is re@@ ce@@ i@@ ving tre@@ at@@ ment so her life can be ex@@ ten@@ ded to take c@@ are of the b@@ ab@@ y she &apos;s about to give b@@ ir@@ th to ."
"And her b@@ ab@@ y will re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , which will mean that that b@@ ab@@ y can be bor@@ n f@@ ree of the vir@@ us ."
Now that is pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion at the very be@@ gin@@ ning of life .
It &apos;s one way to start looking at inter@@ v@@ en@@ tion with the A@@ ID@@ S p@@ an@@ de@@ mi@@ c .
"Now , I just would like to fin@@ ish off to tell you the little story about A@@ ve@@ li@@ le ."
This is A@@ ve@@ li@@ le — she go@@ es with me wh@@ er@@ ever I go .
I tell her story to every@@ one because she re@@ pres@@ ents one of mil@@ li@@ ons of HI@@ V / A@@ ID@@ S or@@ ph@@ ans .
A@@ ve@@ li@@ le &apos;s mo@@ ther had HI@@ V vir@@ us — she di@@ ed from A@@ ID@@ S-@@ re@@ l@@ ated ill@@ n@@ ess .
"A@@ ve@@ li@@ le had the vir@@ us , she was bor@@ n with the vir@@ us ."
"And here she is at se@@ ven years old , we@@ i@@ gh@@ ing no more than a one ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old b@@ ab@@ y ."
"A@@ t this point in her life , she &apos;s su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing with ful@@ l@@ -@@ b@@ lo@@ wn A@@ ID@@ S and had p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ i@@ a ."
We me@@ t her in a h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al in the E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n C@@ ap@@ e and sp@@ ent a whole af@@ ter@@ no@@ on with her — an ad@@ or@@ able chil@@ d .
The do@@ ct@@ ors and n@@ ur@@ ses were ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
They put her on very sp@@ eci@@ al nu@@ tri@@ ti@@ ous di@@ et and took great c@@ are of her .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al — because we f@@ il@@ m@@ ed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
"So , it was ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly — it was a very e@@ mo@@ tional en@@ coun@@ ter and left us fe@@ el@@ ing very res@@ on@@ ant with this di@@ rec@@ t experi@@ ence , this one chil@@ d , you know , that story ."

They &apos;re st@@ an@@ ding up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the tran@@ s@@ formation that took place .
Is@@ n &apos;t it ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary ?
( Applause ) That r@@ ound of ap@@ plause is actually for the do@@ ct@@ ors and n@@ ur@@ ses of the h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al who took c@@ are of A@@ ve@@ li@@ le .
And I take it that you ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate that kind of tran@@ s@@ formation .
"So , I would like to say to you , each one in the au@@ di@@ ence , if you feel that every mo@@ ther and every chil@@ d in the world has the right to have ac@@ cess to good nu@@ tri@@ tion and good medi@@ cal c@@ are , and you believe that the M@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ment Go@@ als , sp@@ eci@@ f@@ ically fi@@ ve and si@@ x , should be ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tely comm@@ it@@ ted to by all gover@@ n@@ m@@ ents around the world — es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally in su@@ b-@@ Sa@@ h@@ ar@@ an Afri@@ c@@ a — could you p@@ le@@ ase st@@ and up ."

"Th@@ ese are si@@ mple ob@@ j@@ ects : c@@ lo@@ c@@ ks , ke@@ ys , com@@ b@@ s , gl@@ as@@ ses ."
They are the things the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de in B@@ os@@ ni@@ a car@@ ri@@ ed with them on their fin@@ al j@@ our@@ ne@@ y .
"U@@ su@@ ally , they were to@@ ld that they were going to be ex@@ chan@@ ged for pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers of w@@ ar ."
And it is quite pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly the lar@@ g@@ est ever disc@@ over@@ ed .
"D@@ ur@@ ing the four years of con@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ t that de@@ va@@ st@@ ated the B@@ os@@ ni@@ an n@@ ation in the ear@@ ly &apos; 90@@ s , ap@@ pro@@ x@@ im@@ at@@ ely 30@@ ,000 ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ s , ma@@ in@@ ly ci@@ vi@@ li@@ ans , went m@@ is@@ sing , pre@@ su@@ m@@ ed k@@ ill@@ ed , and another 1@@ 00@@ ,000 were k@@ ill@@ ed d@@ ur@@ ing com@@ b@@ at op@@ er@@ ations ."
The inter@@ na@@ tional cri@@ min@@ al tri@@ b@@ un@@ al de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed a number of s@@ ent@@ en@@ ces for cri@@ m@@ es aga@@ in@@ st hum@@ an@@ ity and gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de .
A@@ s much as gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de is about k@@ ill@@ ing .
"It is also about de@@ st@@ ro@@ ying their pro@@ per@@ ty , their cul@@ tur@@ al h@@ er@@ it@@ age , and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely the very no@@ tion that they ever ex@@ i@@ st@@ ed ."
G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is not only about the k@@ ill@@ ing ; it is about the d@@ en@@ i@@ ed id@@ enti@@ ty .
There are always tr@@ ac@@ es — no s@@ uch thing as a per@@ f@@ ect cri@@ me .
There are always re@@ m@@ n@@ an@@ ts of the per@@ i@@ sh@@ ed ones that are more d@@ ur@@ able than their f@@ ra@@ gi@@ le bo@@ di@@ es and our sel@@ ec@@ tive and f@@ ad@@ ing me@@ mor@@ y of them .
No@@ t a sing@@ le body should re@@ ma@@ in un@@ disc@@ over@@ ed or uni@@ d@@ enti@@ fi@@ ed .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of ar@@ ti@@ fac@@ ts are p@@ ac@@ ked in wh@@ ite pl@@ as@@ tic b@@ ag@@ s just like the ones you see on C@@ S@@ I .
"Th@@ ese ob@@ j@@ ects are used as a for@@ en@@ si@@ c to@@ o@@ l in vi@@ su@@ al id@@ enti@@ fi@@ cation of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , but they are also used as very val@@ u@@ able for@@ en@@ si@@ c e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence in the on@@ going w@@ ar cri@@ m@@ es tri@@ als ."

So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I lear@@ ned wh@@ i@@ le doing these 30@@ -@@ day ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges .
This was part of a ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge I did to take a pic@@ ture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous before I started my 30@@ -@@ day ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges .
It &apos;s aw@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a t@@ on of fu@@ n ."
( Applause )
"H@@ i . So today , I &apos;d like to sh@@ are some wor@@ ks in pro@@ gre@@ s@@ s ."
"S@@ in@@ ce we are still re@@ aliz@@ ing these wor@@ ks , we are lar@@ ge@@ ly working with@@ in the re@@ al@@ m of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion and my@@ st@@ er@@ y , still ."
So I &apos;m going to try and des@@ cri@@ be some of the experi@@ en@@ ces that we &apos;re looking for through each of the wor@@ ks .
So the first work is called the I@@ m@@ per@@ i@@ al M@@ on@@ o@@ ch@@ r@@ om@@ es .
"@@ A vi@@ ew@@ er sort of un@@ s@@ us@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ing@@ ly wal@@ ks into the room , and ca@@ t@@ ch@@ es a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of these p@@ an@@ el@@ s in a m@@ ess@@ y comp@@ os@@ i@@ tion on the w@@ all ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in secon@@ ds , as if the p@@ an@@ el@@ s have no@@ tic@@ ed the pres@@ ence of the vi@@ ew@@ er , they ap@@ pe@@ ar to p@@ an@@ ic and sort of get into a stri@@ c@@ t sy@@ m@@ me@@ try ."
( Laughter ) So this is the s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch of the two st@@ ates .
On@@ e is t@@ ot@@ al c@@ ha@@ o@@ s . The other is ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ e or@@ der .
And we were interest@@ ed in see@@ ing how little change it ta@@ kes to mo@@ ve from one st@@ ate to the other st@@ ate .
This also re@@ min@@ ded us of two very different pic@@ t@@ or@@ i@@ al tra@@ di@@ tions .
"O@@ n@@ e is the al@@ ta@@ r t@@ ab@@ le@@ ts of the 15@@ th c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y , and the other is about 10@@ 0 years ago , M@@ al@@ ev@@ ich &apos;s ab@@ str@@ act comp@@ os@@ i@@ tions ."
So I &apos;m just going to take you to a vi@@ de@@ o .
That &apos;s about this much . And the sm@@ all@@ est one is an A@@ 4 .
"So a vi@@ ew@@ er en@@ ters the space , and they s@@ na@@ p to at@@ ten@@ tion ."
"And after a wh@@ i@@ le , if the vi@@ ew@@ er cont@@ in@@ u@@ es to re@@ ma@@ in in the space , the p@@ an@@ el@@ s will sort of become im@@ m@@ un@@ e to the pres@@ ence of the vi@@ ew@@ er and become la@@ x and au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ous again , un@@ ti@@ l they sort of sense a pres@@ ence in the room or a mo@@ v@@ ement , when they will again s@@ na@@ p to at@@ ten@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) So here it ap@@ pe@@ ars as if it &apos;s the vi@@ ew@@ er that &apos;s sort of in@@ sti@@ g@@ ating the sense of or@@ der am@@ ong the p@@ an@@ el@@ s , but it could also be the other way around , that the p@@ an@@ el@@ s are so st@@ uc@@ k with@@ in their pre@@ con@@ di@@ tion@@ ed be@@ ha@@ vi@@ ors that they sort of thr@@ ust the vi@@ ew@@ er with the ro@@ le of a ty@@ r@@ ant ."
So this in@@ st@@ ab@@ ility in the mo@@ v@@ ement very cl@@ os@@ ely re@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ es the un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y nat@@ ure of ima@@ ges se@@ en through a h@@ and@@ hel@@ d ca@@ m@@ er@@ a .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two t@@ an@@ de@@ m cli@@ ps .
On@@ e is through a still ca@@ m@@ er@@ a and the other is through a h@@ and@@ hel@@ d ca@@ m@@ er@@ a .
And you im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely see how the un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y nat@@ ure of the vi@@ de@@ o su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts the pres@@ ence of an ob@@ ser@@ ver and a su@@ bj@@ ec@@ tive point of vi@@ e@@ w .
So we &apos;ve just re@@ mo@@ ved the ca@@ m@@ er@@ a and tran@@ s@@ f@@ er@@ red that mo@@ v@@ ement on@@ to the p@@ an@@ el .
So here &apos;s a vi@@ de@@ o .
You have to ima@@ gine the other h@@ and . It &apos;s not there ye@@ t .
"But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to ev@@ o@@ ke a sel@@ f-@@ eff@@ ac@@ ing ge@@ st@@ ure , as if there &apos;s a little person with out@@ st@@ re@@ t@@ ch@@ ed ar@@ ms be@@ h@@ ind this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous piec@@ e of p@@ ap@@ er ."
That sort of li@@ k@@ en@@ s it to the am@@ oun@@ t of st@@ ra@@ in to be at the ser@@ v@@ ice of the ob@@ ser@@ ver and pres@@ ent this piec@@ e of p@@ ap@@ er very de@@ li@@ ca@@ tely to the vi@@ ew@@ er in fr@@ on@@ t of them .
The next work is D@@ ec@@ o@@ y .
"This is a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard mo@@ de@@ l , so the ob@@ j@@ ect is about as t@@ all as I am ."
"It has a r@@ oun@@ ded body , two ar@@ ms , and a very t@@ all , he@@ ad@@ -@@ like an@@ ten@@ n@@ a , and its so@@ le p@@ ur@@ p@@ ose is to at@@ tr@@ act at@@ ten@@ tion to@@ war@@ ds it@@ self ."
"So when a vi@@ ew@@ er p@@ as@@ ses by , it sort of ti@@ l@@ ts from side to side , and mo@@ ves its ar@@ ms more and more fr@@ an@@ tic@@ ally as the person ge@@ ts cl@@ os@@ er ."
So here is the first t@@ est sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
"You see the two mo@@ v@@ em@@ ents in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated , and the ob@@ j@@ ect se@@ ems to be e@@ mp@@ lo@@ ying its enti@@ re being in this ex@@ pres@@ sion of des@@ per@@ ation ."
"But the idea is that on@@ ce it &apos;s got the person &apos;s at@@ ten@@ tion , it &apos;s no l@@ on@@ ger interest@@ ed , and it loo@@ ks for the next person wh@@ ose at@@ ten@@ tion to get ."
It ap@@ pe@@ ars to be ma@@ ss@@ -@@ man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ red like it came out of a fac@@ t@@ ory like v@@ ac@@ u@@ um c@@ le@@ an@@ ers and w@@ as@@ h@@ ing m@@ ach@@ in@@ es .
"@@ Because we are always working from a very per@@ s@@ on@@ al space , we like how this con@@ su@@ m@@ er a@@ es@@ the@@ tic sort of de@@ per@@ s@@ on@@ aliz@@ es the ob@@ j@@ ect and gi@@ ves us a bit of di@@ st@@ ance in its ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance , at le@@ ast ."
"And so to us this is a kind of s@@ in@@ i@@ ster being which is trying to di@@ str@@ act you from the things that actually need your at@@ ten@@ tion , but it could also be a fi@@ g@@ ure that nee@@ ds a lot of help ."
"The next work is an ob@@ j@@ ect , that &apos;s also a kind of s@@ ound in@@ str@@ um@@ ent ."
I@@ n the sh@@ ap@@ e of an a@@ mp@@ hi@@ the@@ ater that &apos;s sc@@ al@@ ed to the si@@ ze of an au@@ di@@ ence as per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved from some@@ body from the st@@ age .
Se@@ ated in this au@@ di@@ ence are 9@@ 9@@ 6 small fi@@ gu@@ res .
They &apos;re m@@ ech@@ an@@ ically en@@ ab@@ l@@ ed to cl@@ a@@ p of their own f@@ ree will .
"So when the vi@@ ew@@ er ste@@ ps in fr@@ on@@ t of the au@@ di@@ ence , there will be a resp@@ on@@ se ."
"It could be any@@ thing from a few fe@@ e@@ ble cl@@ ap@@ s from memb@@ ers in the au@@ di@@ ence , or it could be a very l@@ ou@@ d o@@ v@@ ation ."
"So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an au@@ di@@ ence as its own ob@@ j@@ ect or its own organ@@ is@@ m that &apos;s also got a sort of mus@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it , an in@@ str@@ um@@ ent ."
"So the vi@@ ew@@ er can pl@@ ay it by e@@ li@@ c@@ iting quite comple@@ x and v@@ ari@@ ed , nu@@ an@@ c@@ ed mus@@ i@@ cal or s@@ ound p@@ at@@ ter@@ ns , but can@@ not really pro@@ vo@@ ke the au@@ di@@ ence into any par@@ tic@@ ular kind of resp@@ on@@ se ."
So there &apos;s a sense of ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment and cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess and un@@ e@@ as@@ iness inv@@ ol@@ ved .
It also has an all@@ ur@@ ing and tr@@ ap@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it .
So here if you see we &apos;re quite ex@@ c@@ ited about the ima@@ ge of the he@@ ad s@@ pl@@ it@@ ting to form the two h@@ ands .
"So here &apos;s a small vi@@ su@@ al an@@ ima@@ tion , as if the two si@@ des of the brain are sort of cl@@ as@@ h@@ ing aga@@ in@@ st each other to kind of make sense of the du@@ ality and the ten@@ sion ."
And here is a prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
So we can &apos;t wa@@ it to be en@@ g@@ ul@@ f@@ ed by 9@@ 9@@ 6 of them .
"O@@ k@@ ay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the F@@ ra@@ m@@ er@@ un@@ n@@ ers ."
It comes out of the idea of a w@@ in@@ d@@ ow .
"This is an ac@@ tu@@ al w@@ in@@ d@@ ow in our stu@@ di@@ o , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different th@@ ic@@ k@@ n@@ ess@@ es of w@@ oo@@ d@@ en sec@@ tions ."
So we used the same w@@ in@@ d@@ ow vo@@ ca@@ b@@ ul@@ ary to con@@ struc@@ t our own f@@ ra@@ me or g@@ ri@@ d that &apos;s s@@ us@@ p@@ en@@ ded in the room and that can be vi@@ ew@@ ed from two si@@ des .
This g@@ ri@@ d is in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited by a tri@@ be of small fi@@ gu@@ res .
"They &apos;re also made up of three different si@@ z@@ es , as if to su@@ gg@@ est a kind of per@@ spec@@ tive or l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e on the sing@@ le pla@@ in ."
E@@ ach of these fi@@ gu@@ res can also ru@@ n bac@@ k@@ w@@ ard and for@@ w@@ ard in the tr@@ ack and hi@@ de be@@ h@@ ind two ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent tr@@ ac@@ ks .
"So in con@@ tr@@ ast to this very ti@@ ght g@@ ri@@ d , we wanted to give these fi@@ gu@@ res a very com@@ i@@ cal and sl@@ ap@@ s@@ tic@@ k-@@ like qu@@ ality , as if a pu@@ p@@ pe@@ te@@ er has ta@@ k@@ en them and ph@@ ys@@ ically an@@ im@@ ated them down the p@@ ath ."
"So we like the idea of these fi@@ gu@@ res sort of s@@ ki@@ pp@@ ing al@@ ong like they &apos;re ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and car@@ ef@@ ree and happ@@ y-@@ go@@ -@@ l@@ uc@@ k@@ y and cont@@ ent , un@@ ti@@ l they sort of sense a mo@@ v@@ ement from the vi@@ ew@@ er and they will hi@@ de be@@ h@@ ind the fa@@ st@@ est w@@ all ."
"So to us , this work also pres@@ ents its own con@@ tra@@ di@@ c@@ tion ."
"Th@@ ese fi@@ gu@@ res are sort of en@@ tr@@ app@@ ed with@@ in this very str@@ ong g@@ ri@@ d , which is like a pri@@ son , but also a for@@ tre@@ s@@ s , because it al@@ low@@ s them to be ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and na@@ i@@ ve and car@@ ef@@ ree and quite ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of the ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world ."
"So all these real life qu@@ ali@@ ties that I talk about are sort of tran@@ sl@@ ated to a very sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c tech@@ ni@@ cal con@@ fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation , and we were very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ate with E@@ T@@ H Zu@@ ri@@ ch to devel@@ op the first prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e ."
So it &apos;s really quite small .
You can see it can f@@ it into the p@@ al@@ m of my h@@ and .
"So ima@@ gine our ex@@ c@@ it@@ ement when we sa@@ w it really working in the stu@@ di@@ o , and here it is ."
( Applause )
This is how the year would go .
"But then , the f@@ un@@ ni@@ est thing happened ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , today I &apos;m a wr@@ it@@ er@@ -@@ b@@ lo@@ gg@@ er gu@@ y ."
"Well , it means everything &apos;s f@@ ine un@@ ti@@ l this happen@@ s ."
"Now , in the an@@ ima@@ l world , that wor@@ ks f@@ ine ."
That &apos;s why there &apos;s an over@@ la@@ p .
I call it the D@@ ar@@ k Pl@@ ay@@ gr@@ ound .
And gu@@ ess who w@@ o@@ ke up ?
"It &apos;s not pret@@ ty , but in the end , it wor@@ ks ."
That &apos;s right — I think all of you are pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors .
That &apos;s one bo@@ x for every we@@ e@@ k of a 90@@ -@@ year life .
"So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that c@@ al@@ end@@ ar ."
We need to st@@ ay aw@@ are of the In@@ st@@ ant G@@ ra@@ ti@@ fi@@ cation M@@ on@@ k@@ ey .
That &apos;s a jo@@ b for all of us .
S@@ om@@ e@@ time so@@ on .
Thank you .
"O@@ n that day , a col@@ um@@ n of Am@@ eri@@ can and Af@@ g@@ ha@@ n t@@ ro@@ op@@ s were making their way through a part of Af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an to help prot@@ ect a grou@@ p of gover@@ n@@ ment off@@ ici@@ als , a grou@@ p of Af@@ g@@ ha@@ n gover@@ n@@ ment off@@ ici@@ als , who would be me@@ e@@ ting with some lo@@ cal v@@ ill@@ age el@@ d@@ ers ."
"The col@@ um@@ n came und@@ er am@@ bus@@ h , and was sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded on three si@@ des , and am@@ on@@ g@@ st many other things , C@@ ap@@ ta@@ in S@@ w@@ en@@ son was re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ ed for r@@ un@@ ning into live fir@@ e to re@@ sc@@ ue the w@@ oun@@ ded and p@@ ul@@ l out the de@@ ad ."
"O@@ n@@ e of the people he re@@ sc@@ u@@ ed was a ser@@ ge@@ ant , and he and a com@@ ra@@ de were making their way to a me@@ de@@ va@@ c he@@ li@@ c@@ op@@ ter ."
"And what was re@@ mar@@ k@@ able about this day is , by sh@@ e@@ er co@@ in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence , one of the me@@ de@@ va@@ c medi@@ c@@ s happened to have a Go@@ Pr@@ o ca@@ m@@ er@@ a on his hel@@ me@@ t and cap@@ tu@@ red the whole sc@@ en@@ e on ca@@ m@@ er@@ a ."
"They put him in the he@@ li@@ c@@ op@@ ter , and then you see C@@ ap@@ ta@@ in S@@ w@@ en@@ son b@@ end over and give him a k@@ is@@ s before he tur@@ ns around to re@@ sc@@ ue more ."
"I sa@@ w this , and I thought to my@@ self , where do people like that come from ?"
"Wh@@ at is that ? That is some de@@ ep , de@@ ep e@@ mo@@ tion , when you would want to do that ."
"You know , in the mil@@ it@@ ary , they give me@@ d@@ als to people who are w@@ ill@@ ing to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice the@@ m@@ selves so that o@@ th@@ ers may ga@@ in ."
"In bus@@ iness , we give b@@ on@@ us@@ es to people who are w@@ ill@@ ing to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice o@@ th@@ ers so that we may ga@@ in ."
We have it bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds . Ri@@ ght ?
Wh@@ y did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s this de@@ ep sense of tr@@ ust and co@@ op@@ er@@ ation .
So tr@@ ust and co@@ op@@ er@@ ation are really important here .
"The problem with con@@ cep@@ ts of tr@@ ust and co@@ op@@ er@@ ation is that they are fe@@ el@@ ings , they are not in@@ struc@@ tions ."
"I can &apos;t si@@ mp@@ ly say to you , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ust me , &quot; &quot; and you will ."
"I can &apos;t si@@ mp@@ ly in@@ struc@@ t two people to co@@ op@@ er@@ ate , and they will ."
It &apos;s not how it wor@@ ks . It &apos;s a fe@@ el@@ ing .
So where does that fe@@ el@@ ing come from ?
"If you go back 50@@ ,000 years to the P@@ al@@ e@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic er@@ a , to the ear@@ ly d@@ ays of H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ en@@ s , what we find is that the world was f@@ ill@@ ed with d@@ an@@ ger , all of these for@@ ces working very , very hard to k@@ ill us ."
No@@ thing per@@ s@@ on@@ al .
"W@@ he@@ ther it was the we@@ a@@ ther , l@@ ack of res@@ our@@ ces , maybe a s@@ ab@@ er@@ -@@ to@@ o@@ th@@ ed ti@@ ger , all of these things working to re@@ du@@ ce our li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an ."
"And so we ev@@ ol@@ ved into soci@@ al an@@ im@@ als , where we li@@ ved together and wor@@ ked together in what I call a c@@ ir@@ c@@ le of sa@@ fe@@ ty , in@@ side the tri@@ be , where we f@@ el@@ t like we be@@ l@@ on@@ ged ."
"And when we f@@ el@@ t sa@@ fe am@@ on@@ g@@ st our own , the nat@@ ur@@ al re@@ ac@@ tion was tr@@ ust and co@@ op@@ er@@ ation ."
There are in@@ h@@ er@@ ent b@@ en@@ ef@@ its to this .
It means I can f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep at ni@@ ght and tr@@ ust that some@@ one from with@@ in my tri@@ be will w@@ at@@ ch for d@@ an@@ ger .
B@@ ad system of sur@@ vi@@ v@@ al .
"It could be the up@@ s and do@@ wn@@ s in the econom@@ y , the un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty of the st@@ oc@@ k mar@@ k@@ et ."
It could be a new technology that r@@ end@@ ers your bus@@ iness mo@@ de@@ l ob@@ so@@ le@@ te over@@ ni@@ ght .
O@@ r it could be your com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion that is some@@ times trying to k@@ ill you .
"It &apos;s some@@ times trying to put you out of bus@@ iness , but at the very min@@ im@@ um is working hard to f@@ ru@@ str@@ ate your gro@@ w@@ th and ste@@ al your bus@@ iness from you ."
He was y@@ ell@@ ed at for at@@ te@@ mp@@ ting to bo@@ ard one grou@@ p too so@@ on .
So I said something .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ y do you have tre@@ at us like ca@@ t@@ tle ?"
Wh@@ y can &apos;t you tre@@ at us like human be@@ ings ? &quot; &quot; And this is ex@@ ac@@ tly what she said to me .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ ir , if I don &apos;t f@@ ol@@ low the r@@ ul@@ es , I could get in tr@@ ou@@ ble or l@@ ose my jo@@ b . &quot; &quot; A@@ ll she was t@@ ell@@ ing me is that she doesn &apos;t feel sa@@ fe . A@@ ll she was t@@ ell@@ ing me is th@@ at@@ "
she doesn &apos;t tr@@ ust her le@@ ad@@ ers .
The reas@@ on we like fl@@ ying S@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ir@@ l@@ in@@ es is not because they nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly h@@ ir@@ e better people .
"You see , if the con@@ di@@ tions are wr@@ ong , we are for@@ c@@ ed to exp@@ end our own time and energy to prot@@ ect our@@ selves from each other , and that in@@ h@@ er@@ ently we@@ ak@@ en@@ s the organ@@ iz@@ ation ."
"The cl@@ os@@ est an@@ al@@ o@@ gy I can give to what a great le@@ ad@@ er is , is like being a par@@ ent ."
"If you think about what being a great par@@ ent is , what do you want ? What ma@@ kes a great par@@ ent ?"
"We want to give our chil@@ d opp@@ ort@@ uni@@ ties , e@@ du@@ cation , di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine them when nec@@ ess@@ ary , all so that they can gro@@ w up and ac@@ hi@@ eve more than we could for our@@ selves ."
G@@ re@@ at le@@ ad@@ ers want ex@@ ac@@ tly the same thing .
"They want to pro@@ vi@@ de their people opp@@ ort@@ unity , e@@ du@@ cation , di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine when nec@@ ess@@ ary , buil@@ d their sel@@ f-@@ con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence , give them the opp@@ ort@@ unity to try and fa@@ il , all so that they could ac@@ hi@@ eve more than we could ever ima@@ gine for our@@ selves ."

We would never do it .
Th@@ en why do we con@@ si@@ der l@@ ay@@ ing off people in@@ side our organ@@ iz@@ ation ?
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e imp@@ le@@ m@@ en@@ ted a poli@@ cy of li@@ fe@@ time e@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .

I &apos;m here to sh@@ are my ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y .
O@@ r is it ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y ?
"@@ Because , of course , this is a ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h that you can &apos;t take with your ca@@ m@@ er@@ a ."
"Y@@ et , my inter@@ est in ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y started as I got my first di@@ g@@ it@@ al ca@@ m@@ er@@ a at the age of 1@@ 5 ."
"It mi@@ x@@ ed with my ear@@ li@@ er p@@ as@@ sion for d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing , but it was a bit different , because using the ca@@ m@@ er@@ a , the pro@@ cess was in the plan@@ ning in@@ ste@@ ad ."
"And when you take a ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h with a ca@@ m@@ er@@ a , the pro@@ cess en@@ ds when you pres@@ s the tri@@ gg@@ er ."
So to me it f@@ el@@ t like ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I f@@ el@@ t like any@@ one could do that .
"So I wanted to create something different , something where the pro@@ cess star@@ ts when you pres@@ s the tri@@ gg@@ er ."
Ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s like this : con@@ struc@@ tion going on al@@ ong a bus@@ y ro@@ ad .
But it has an un@@ exp@@ ec@@ ted tw@@ ist .
"And des@@ p@@ ite that , it re@@ ta@@ ins a le@@ vel of re@@ al@@ is@@ m ."
"O@@ r ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s like these — bot@@ h d@@ ar@@ k and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a comm@@ on go@@ al of re@@ ta@@ in@@ ing the le@@ vel of re@@ al@@ is@@ m ."
"When I say re@@ al@@ is@@ m , I mean ph@@ ot@@ o-@@ re@@ al@@ is@@ m ."
"@@ Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tu@@ red some@@ how as a ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h ."
Ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s where you will need a b@@ ri@@ e@@ f mom@@ ent to think to fi@@ g@@ ure out the tri@@ c@@ k .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea than about cap@@ tur@@ ing a mom@@ ent really .
But what &apos;s the tri@@ c@@ k that ma@@ kes it look re@@ al@@ is@@ tic ?
I@@ s it something about the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s or the col@@ ors ?
I@@ s it something about the light ?
What cre@@ ates the ill@@ us@@ i@@ on ?
S@@ om@@ e@@ times the per@@ spec@@ tive is the ill@@ us@@ i@@ on .
"But in the end , it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be re@@ aliz@@ ed on a tw@@ o-@@ di@@ m@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ al sur@@ face ."
"It &apos;s not really what is re@@ al@@ is@@ tic , it &apos;s what we think loo@@ ks re@@ al@@ is@@ tic really ."
So I think the bas@@ ic@@ s are quite si@@ mple .
I just see it as a pu@@ zz@@ le of re@@ ality where you can take different piec@@ es of re@@ ality and put it together to create al@@ ter@@ n@@ ate re@@ ality .
And let me show you a si@@ mple example .
"H@@ ere we have three per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly ima@@ gin@@ able ph@@ y@@ si@@ cal ob@@ j@@ ects , something we all can re@@ l@@ ate to li@@ ving in a th@@ re@@ e-@@ di@@ m@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ al world ."
"But com@@ b@@ in@@ ed in a cer@@ ta@@ in way , they can create something that still loo@@ ks th@@ re@@ e-@@ di@@ m@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ al , like it could ex@@ ist ."
"But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t ."
"So we tri@@ c@@ k our bra@@ ins , because our brain si@@ mp@@ ly doesn &apos;t ac@@ cep@@ t the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense ."
And I see the same pro@@ cess with com@@ b@@ in@@ ing ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about com@@ b@@ in@@ ing different re@@ ali@@ ties .
"So the things that make a ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h look re@@ al@@ is@@ tic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our da@@ i@@ ly li@@ ves ."
"But when com@@ b@@ in@@ ing ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ s , this is really important to con@@ si@@ der , because o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se it just loo@@ ks wr@@ ong some@@ how ."
So I would like to say that there are three si@@ mple r@@ ul@@ es to f@@ ol@@ low to ac@@ hi@@ eve a re@@ al@@ is@@ tic res@@ ult .
"A@@ s you can see , these ima@@ ges ar@@ en &apos;t really sp@@ eci@@ al ."
"But com@@ b@@ in@@ ed , they can create something like this ."
So the first ru@@ le is that ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s com@@ b@@ in@@ ed should have the same per@@ spec@@ tive .
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s com@@ b@@ in@@ ed should have the same t@@ yp@@ e of light ."
And these two ima@@ ges bot@@ h ful@@ f@@ ill these two re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ m@@ ents — sh@@ o@@ t at the same he@@ i@@ ght and in the same t@@ yp@@ e of light .
The th@@ ir@@ d one is about making it imp@@ os@@ sible to di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ ish where the different ima@@ ges be@@ g@@ in and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
Ma@@ ke it imp@@ os@@ sible to say how the ima@@ ge actually was comp@@ os@@ ed .
"So by mat@@ ch@@ ing col@@ or , con@@ tr@@ ast and b@@ ri@@ gh@@ tn@@ ess in the bor@@ d@@ ers between the different ima@@ ges , ad@@ ding ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ c de@@ f@@ ects like de@@ p@@ th of fi@@ el@@ d , des@@ at@@ ur@@ ated col@@ ors and no@@ i@@ se , we er@@ ase the bor@@ d@@ ers between the different ima@@ ges and make it look like one sing@@ le ima@@ ge , des@@ p@@ ite the fact that one ima@@ ge can con@@ ta@@ in h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of l@@ ay@@ ers bas@@ ically ."
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) On@@ e might think that this is just an ima@@ ge of a l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e and the low@@ er part is what &apos;s man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ated .
But this ima@@ ge is actually enti@@ re@@ ly comp@@ os@@ ed of ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ s from different lo@@ ca@@ tions .
"I per@@ s@@ on@@ ally think that it &apos;s e@@ as@@ i@@ er to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to comp@@ r@@ om@@ i@@ se with the ide@@ as in your he@@ ad ."
But it does re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e a lot of plan@@ ning .
"And getting this idea d@@ ur@@ ing w@@ in@@ ter , I k@@ new that I had se@@ ver@@ al mon@@ ths to pl@@ an it , to find the different lo@@ ca@@ tions for the piec@@ es of the pu@@ zz@@ le bas@@ ically ."
"So for example , the f@@ ish was cap@@ tu@@ red on a fi@@ sh@@ ing tri@@ p ."
The sh@@ o@@ res are from a different lo@@ cation .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tu@@ red in a st@@ one p@@ it .
"And ye@@ a@@ h , I even tur@@ ned the h@@ ou@@ se on to@@ p of the is@@ l@@ and red to make it look more S@@ we@@ dis@@ h ."
"So to ac@@ hi@@ eve a re@@ al@@ is@@ tic res@@ ult , I think it comes down to plan@@ ning ."
"It always star@@ ts with a s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch , an idea ."
Th@@ en it &apos;s about com@@ b@@ in@@ ing the different ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ s .
And here every piec@@ e is very well plan@@ ned .
"And if you do a good jo@@ b cap@@ tur@@ ing the ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s , the res@@ ult can be quite be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful and also quite re@@ al@@ is@@ tic ."
"So all the to@@ ol@@ s are out there , and the only thing that li@@ m@@ its us is our ima@@ gin@@ ation ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
This is the sort of be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or that a@@ ff@@ ects all of us .
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Ju@@ li@@ an , w@@ el@@ come ."
"It &apos;s been re@@ p@@ or@@ ted that Wi@@ ki@@ L@@ ea@@ ks , your b@@ ab@@ y , has , in the last few years has re@@ le@@ as@@ ed more cl@@ as@@ si@@ fi@@ ed do@@ c@@ um@@ ents than the re@@ st of the world &apos;s medi@@ a com@@ b@@ in@@ ed ."
C@@ an that pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly be tr@@ ue ?
"J@@ u@@ li@@ an A@@ ss@@ an@@ ge : Y@@ ea@@ h , can it pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly be tr@@ ue ?"
It &apos;s a wor@@ ry — is@@ n &apos;t it ? — that the re@@ st of the world &apos;s medi@@ a is doing s@@ uch a b@@ ad jo@@ b that a little grou@@ p of ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts is able to re@@ le@@ ase more of that t@@ yp@@ e of information than the re@@ st of the world pres@@ s com@@ b@@ in@@ ed .

"J@@ A : So these are — as f@@ ar as we can tell — cl@@ as@@ si@@ cal wh@@ i@@ st@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us ."
"So we use this st@@ at@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art en@@ cr@@ yp@@ tion to b@@ oun@@ ce stu@@ ff around the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t , to hi@@ de tra@@ il@@ s , p@@ as@@ s it through le@@ g@@ al ju@@ ri@@ s@@ di@@ c@@ tions like S@@ we@@ d@@ en and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those le@@ g@@ al prot@@ ec@@ tions ."

( Ph@@ one r@@ ing ) G@@ od d@@ am@@ n it .

"So let &apos;s take &#9@@ 1@@ ; an &#9@@ 3@@ ; example , actually ."
This is something you lea@@ ked a few years ago .
I@@ f we can have this do@@ c@@ um@@ ent up ..@@ .
So this was a story in K@@ en@@ y@@ a a few years ago .
C@@ an you tell us what you lea@@ ked and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ ro@@ ll R@@ ep@@ ort .
This was a sec@@ re@@ t int@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ ence re@@ p@@ ort comm@@ is@@ si@@ on@@ ed by the K@@ en@@ y@@ an gover@@ n@@ ment after its elec@@ tion in 2@@ 00@@ 4 .
"P@@ ri@@ or to 2@@ 00@@ 4 , K@@ en@@ y@@ a was r@@ ul@@ ed by D@@ an@@ i@@ el ar@@ a@@ p Mo@@ i for about 1@@ 8 years ."
He was a so@@ ft di@@ ct@@ at@@ or of K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
"And when K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i got into power — through a co@@ ali@@ tion of for@@ ces that were trying to c@@ le@@ an up cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion in K@@ en@@ y@@ a — they comm@@ is@@ si@@ on@@ ed this re@@ p@@ ort , sp@@ ent about two million p@@ oun@@ ds on this and an as@@ soci@@ ated re@@ p@@ ort ."
"And then the gover@@ n@@ ment s@@ at on it and used it for poli@@ tical le@@ ver@@ age on Mo@@ i , who was the ri@@ ch@@ est man — still is the ri@@ ch@@ est man — in K@@ en@@ y@@ a ."
It &apos;s the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il of K@@ en@@ y@@ an j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ m .
"So I went there in 2@@ 00@@ 7 , and we man@@ ag@@ ed to get ho@@ ld of this just pri@@ or to the elec@@ tion — the na@@ tional elec@@ tion , D@@ ec@@ em@@ b@@ er 2@@ 8 ."
"When we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed that re@@ p@@ ort , we did so three d@@ ays after the new pre@@ si@@ d@@ ent , K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i , had deci@@ ded to p@@ al up with the man that he was going to c@@ le@@ an out , D@@ an@@ i@@ el ar@@ a@@ p Mo@@ i , so this re@@ p@@ ort then be@@ came a de@@ ad al@@ b@@ at@@ r@@ oss around P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ent K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i &apos;s nec@@ k ."
"C@@ A : And — I mean , to c@@ ut a long story sh@@ ort — wor@@ d of the re@@ p@@ ort lea@@ ked into K@@ en@@ y@@ a , not from the off@@ ici@@ al medi@@ a , but in@@ di@@ rec@@ tly , and in your op@@ in@@ i@@ on , it actually shi@@ f@@ ted the elec@@ tion ."
"J@@ A : Y@@ ea@@ h . So this be@@ came fr@@ on@@ t p@@ age of the Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an and was then pr@@ in@@ ted in all the sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding coun@@ tries of K@@ en@@ y@@ a , in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ an and S@@ ou@@ th Afri@@ can pres@@ s ."
And so it came in from the out@@ side .
"And that , after a cou@@ ple of d@@ ays , made the K@@ en@@ y@@ an pres@@ s feel sa@@ fe to talk about it ."
"And it r@@ an for 2@@ 0 ni@@ gh@@ ts st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght on K@@ en@@ y@@ an T@@ V , shi@@ f@@ ted the v@@ ot@@ e by 10 percent , ac@@ cor@@ ding to a K@@ en@@ y@@ an int@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ ence re@@ p@@ ort , which chan@@ ged the res@@ ult of the elec@@ tion ."
"C@@ A : W@@ ow , so your lea@@ k really su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ ally chan@@ ged the world ?"
J@@ A : Y@@ ep .
( Applause ) C@@ A : H@@ ere &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a sh@@ ort cli@@ p from this Ba@@ gh@@ d@@ ad a@@ ir@@ stri@@ ke vi@@ de@@ o .
"The vi@@ de@@ o it@@ self is l@@ on@@ ger , but here &apos;s a sh@@ ort cli@@ p ."
"This is — this is in@@ ten@@ se mat@@ eri@@ al , I should war@@ n you ."
"R@@ a@@ di@@ o : ..@@ . just f@@ uc@@ k@@ in &apos; , on@@ ce you get on &apos; e@@ m just op@@ en &apos; e@@ m up ."

L@@ et me know when you &apos;ve got them . L@@ et &apos;s sh@@ oo@@ t .
Li@@ ght &apos; e@@ m all up .

( M@@ ach@@ ine gu@@ n fir@@ e ) K@@ e@@ ep sh@@ oo@@ t &apos; n . K@@ e@@ ep sh@@ oo@@ t &apos; n . ( M@@ ach@@ ine gu@@ n fir@@ e ) K@@ e@@ ep sh@@ oo@@ t &apos; n .

"@@ we need to mo@@ ve , time now !@@ "
"A@@ ll right , we just en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed all ei@@ ght in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als ."
"Y@@ ea@@ h , we see two b@@ ir@@ ds &#9@@ 1@@ ; he@@ li@@ c@@ op@@ ters &#9@@ 3@@ ; , and we &apos;re still fir@@ ing ."
Ro@@ ger . I got &apos; e@@ m .
"T@@ w@@ o-@@ Si@@ x , this is Tw@@ o-@@ Si@@ x , we &apos;re mo@@ bi@@ le ."
"O@@ op@@ s , I &apos;m s@@ or@@ ry . What was going on ?"
"G@@ od d@@ am@@ n it , K@@ y@@ le . A@@ ll right , ha@@ ha@@ h@@ a . I h@@ it &apos; e@@ m ."
"C@@ A : So , what was the imp@@ act of that ?"
J@@ A : The imp@@ act on the people who wor@@ ked on it was se@@ v@@ ere .
We en@@ ded up sen@@ ding two people to Ba@@ gh@@ d@@ ad to f@@ ur@@ ther re@@ sear@@ ch that story .
So this is just the first of three at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks that oc@@ cur@@ red in that sc@@ en@@ e .
"C@@ A : So , I mean , 1@@ 1 people di@@ ed in that at@@ t@@ ack , right , in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding two Re@@ u@@ ters e@@ mp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es ?"
"J@@ A : Y@@ ea@@ h . Tw@@ o Re@@ u@@ ters e@@ mp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , two y@@ oun@@ g children were w@@ oun@@ ded ."
There were between 1@@ 8 and 2@@ 6 people k@@ ill@@ ed all together .
C@@ A : And re@@ le@@ as@@ ing this ca@@ used wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ou@@ tra@@ ge .
"Wh@@ at was the k@@ ey el@@ ement of this that actually ca@@ used the ou@@ tra@@ ge , do you think ?"
J@@ A : I don &apos;t know . I gu@@ ess people can see the gr@@ oss di@@ sp@@ ar@@ ity in for@@ ce .
"You have gu@@ ys wal@@ king in a re@@ la@@ x@@ ed way down the st@@ re@@ et , and then an Ap@@ ac@@ he he@@ li@@ c@@ op@@ ter s@@ it@@ ting up at one k@@ il@@ om@@ e@@ ter fir@@ ing 30@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ me@@ ter can@@ n@@ on sh@@ ells on every@@ one — looking for any ex@@ c@@ use to do so — and k@@ ill@@ ing people re@@ sc@@ u@@ ing the w@@ oun@@ ded ."
And there was two j@@ our@@ n@@ ali@@ sts inv@@ ol@@ ved that c@@ lear@@ ly w@@ er@@ en &apos;t in@@ sur@@ g@@ ents because that &apos;s their ful@@ l@@ -@@ time jo@@ b .
"C@@ A : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.@@ S@@ . int@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ ence an@@ al@@ y@@ st , B@@ ra@@ d@@ le@@ y M@@ an@@ ning , ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed , and it &apos;s al@@ le@@ ged that he con@@ f@@ ess@@ ed in a ch@@ at room to have lea@@ ked this vi@@ de@@ o to you , al@@ ong with 2@@ 80@@ ,000 cl@@ as@@ si@@ fi@@ ed U.@@ S@@ . em@@ bas@@ s@@ y ca@@ bl@@ es ."
"I mean , did he ?"
J@@ A : We have d@@ en@@ i@@ ed re@@ ce@@ i@@ ving those ca@@ bl@@ es .
"H@@ e has been ch@@ ar@@ ged , about fi@@ ve d@@ ays ago , with ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ing 1@@ 50@@ ,000 ca@@ bl@@ es and re@@ le@@ as@@ ing 5@@ 0 ."
"Now , we had re@@ le@@ as@@ ed , ear@@ ly in the year , a ca@@ ble from the R@@ ey@@ k@@ ja@@ vi@@ k U.@@ S@@ . em@@ bas@@ s@@ y , but this is not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly con@@ nec@@ ted ."
"I mean , I was a kno@@ wn vi@@ s@@ it@@ or of that em@@ bas@@ s@@ y ."
"C@@ A : I mean , if you did re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve thou@@ s@@ ands of U.@@ S@@ . em@@ bas@@ s@@ y di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ tic ca@@ bl@@ es ..@@ ."
"J@@ A : We would have re@@ le@@ as@@ ed them . ( C@@ A : You would ? ) J@@ A : Y@@ ea@@ h . ( C@@ A : Because ? ) J@@ A : W@@ ell , because these sort of things re@@ ve@@ al what the tr@@ ue st@@ ate of , say , A@@ ra@@ b gover@@ n@@ m@@ ents are like , the tr@@ ue hum@@ an@@ -@@ ri@@ gh@@ ts ab@@ us@@ es in those gover@@ n@@ m@@ ents ."
"If you look at d@@ ec@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ fi@@ ed ca@@ bl@@ es , that &apos;s the sort of mat@@ eri@@ al that &apos;s there ."
C@@ A : So let &apos;s talk a little more b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ly about this .
"I mean , in gener@@ al , what &apos;s your ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y ?"
Wh@@ y is it right to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge lea@@ king of sec@@ re@@ t information ?
"J@@ A : W@@ ell , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can ac@@ hi@@ eve re@@ form ."
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
"So information that organ@@ iz@@ ations are sp@@ en@@ ding econom@@ ic eff@@ ort into con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing , that &apos;s a really good si@@ gn@@ al that when the information ge@@ ts out , there &apos;s a hop@@ e of it doing some good — because the organ@@ iz@@ ations that know it best , that know it from the in@@ side out , are sp@@ en@@ ding work to con@@ ce@@ al it ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in pr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ce , and that &apos;s what the hi@@ story of j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ m is ."
"C@@ A : But are there ri@@ s@@ ks with that , ei@@ ther to the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als con@@ cer@@ ned or in@@ de@@ ed to soci@@ e@@ ty at lar@@ ge , where lea@@ king can actually have an un@@ in@@ ten@@ ded con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence ?"
J@@ A : No@@ t that we have se@@ en with any@@ thing we have re@@ le@@ as@@ ed .
"I mean , we have a h@@ ar@@ m im@@ m@@ un@@ iz@@ ation poli@@ cy ."
We have a way of de@@ al@@ ing with information that has sort of per@@ s@@ on@@ al — per@@ s@@ on@@ ally id@@ enti@@ f@@ ying information in it .
"But there are le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate sec@@ re@@ ts — you know , your rec@@ or@@ ds with your do@@ ct@@ or ; that &apos;s a le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate sec@@ re@@ t — but we de@@ al with wh@@ i@@ st@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers that are coming for@@ w@@ ard that are really sort of w@@ ell@@ -@@ mo@@ tiv@@ ated ."
C@@ A : So they are w@@ ell@@ -@@ mo@@ tiv@@ ated .
"And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the par@@ ent of some@@ one wh@@ ose son is out ser@@ ving the U.@@ S@@ . mil@@ it@@ ary , and he sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that some@@ one had an in@@ c@@ enti@@ ve to put out ."
It show@@ s a U.@@ S@@ . sol@@ di@@ er l@@ augh@@ ing at people d@@ ying .
"That gi@@ ves the imp@@ res@@ sion , has gi@@ ven the imp@@ res@@ sion , to mil@@ li@@ ons of people around the world that U.@@ S@@ . sol@@ di@@ ers are in@@ human people ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , they &apos;re not . M@@ y son is@@ n &apos;t . How d@@ are you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?"
"J@@ A : Y@@ ea@@ h , we do get a lot of that ."
"But re@@ memb@@ er , the people in Ba@@ gh@@ d@@ ad , the people in I@@ ra@@ q , the people in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an — they don &apos;t need to see the vi@@ de@@ o ; they see it every day ."
So it &apos;s not going to change their op@@ in@@ i@@ on . It &apos;s not going to change their per@@ cep@@ tion .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
"It will change the per@@ cep@@ tion and op@@ in@@ i@@ on of the people who are p@@ ay@@ ing for it all , and that &apos;s our hop@@ e ."
C@@ A : So you found a way to sh@@ ine light into what you see as these sort of d@@ ar@@ k sec@@ re@@ ts in comp@@ an@@ ies and in gover@@ n@@ ment .
Li@@ ght is good .
"But do you see any ir@@ on@@ y in the fact that , in or@@ der for you to sh@@ ine that light , you have to , y@@ our@@ self , create sec@@ rec@@ y around your s@@ our@@ ces ?"
"J@@ A : No@@ t really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any Wi@@ ki@@ L@@ ea@@ ks dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents ye@@ t ."
We don &apos;t have s@@ our@@ ces who are dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents on other s@@ our@@ ces .
"S@@ h@@ ould they come for@@ w@@ ard , that would be a tri@@ ck@@ y s@@ it@@ u@@ ation for us , but we &apos;re pre@@ su@@ ma@@ b@@ ly ac@@ ting in s@@ uch a way that people feel mor@@ ally comp@@ ell@@ ed to cont@@ in@@ ue our m@@ is@@ sion , not to sc@@ re@@ w it up ."
"C@@ A : I &apos;d actually be interest@@ ed , just bas@@ ed on what we &apos;ve he@@ ard so f@@ ar — I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous as to the op@@ in@@ i@@ on in the TE@@ D au@@ di@@ ence ."
"You know , there might be a cou@@ ple of vi@@ e@@ ws of Wi@@ ki@@ L@@ ea@@ ks and of Ju@@ li@@ an ."
"You know , h@@ er@@ o — people &apos;s h@@ er@@ o — br@@ ing@@ ing this important light ."
D@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ k@@ er .
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the h@@ er@@ o vi@@ e@@ w ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ k@@ er vi@@ e@@ w ?
"J@@ A : O@@ h , come on . There m@@ ust be some ."
"C@@ A : It &apos;s a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d , Ju@@ li@@ an , a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
We have to try better . L@@ et &apos;s show them another example .
"Now here &apos;s something that you ha@@ ven &apos;t ye@@ t lea@@ ked , but I think for TE@@ D you are ."
"I mean it &apos;s an in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?"
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a sa@@ mple of what we do sort of every day .
"So l@@ ate last year — in No@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er last year — there was a ser@@ ies of well b@@ low@@ ou@@ ts in Al@@ b@@ an@@ i@@ a , like the well b@@ low@@ out in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , but not quite as big ."
"And we got a re@@ p@@ ort — a sort of en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing an@@ al@@ ys@@ is into what happened — sa@@ ying that , in fact , sec@@ ur@@ ity gu@@ ar@@ ds from some ri@@ v@@ al , v@@ ari@@ ous com@@ pe@@ ting o@@ il fir@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked tr@@ uc@@ ks there and b@@ lo@@ wn them up ."
"And part of the Al@@ b@@ an@@ i@@ an gover@@ n@@ ment was in this , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
"And the en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing re@@ p@@ ort had no@@ thing on the to@@ p of it , so it was an ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly diff@@ ic@@ ult do@@ c@@ um@@ ent for us ."
We cou@@ ldn &apos;t ver@@ i@@ f@@ y it because we didn &apos;t know who wr@@ ot@@ e it and k@@ new what it was about .
So we were kind of s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical that maybe it was a com@@ pe@@ ting o@@ il fir@@ m just sort of pl@@ ay@@ ing the is@@ su@@ e up .
"So und@@ er that bas@@ is , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , we &apos;re s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical about this thing ."
"We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?"
"The mat@@ eri@@ al loo@@ ks good , it fe@@ el@@ s right , but we just can &apos;t ver@@ i@@ f@@ y it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a le@@ tter just this we@@ e@@ k from the comp@@ any who wr@@ ot@@ e it , wan@@ ting to tr@@ ack down the s@@ our@@ ce — ( Laughter ) sa@@ ying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , we want to tr@@ ack down the s@@ our@@ ce . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , tell us more ."
"Wh@@ at do@@ c@@ um@@ ent is it , pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly , you &apos;re tal@@ king about ?"
C@@ an you show that you had le@@ g@@ al au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over that do@@ c@@ um@@ ent ?
I@@ s it really y@@ our@@ s ? &quot; &quot; So they s@@ ent us this sc@@ re@@ en sh@@ o@@ t with the au@@ th@@ or in the M@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ of@@ t W@@ or@@ d I@@ D .
Y@@ ea@@ h .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot th@@ ough .
"This is like one of our me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of id@@ enti@@ f@@ ying , of ver@@ i@@ f@@ ying , what a mat@@ eri@@ al is , is to try and get these gu@@ ys to wr@@ ite le@@ t@@ ters ."
C@@ A : Y@@ ea@@ h . Ha@@ ve you had information from in@@ side B@@ P ?
"J@@ A : Y@@ ea@@ h , we have a lot , but I mean , at the mom@@ ent , we are under@@ going a sort of s@@ eri@@ ous f@@ und@@ ra@@ is@@ ing and en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing eff@@ ort ."
So our publi@@ cation r@@ ate over the p@@ ast few mon@@ ths has been sort of min@@ i@@ mi@@ z@@ ed wh@@ i@@ le we &apos;re re@@ -@@ en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing our back sy@@ st@@ ems for the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al publi@@ c inter@@ est that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
"I mean , like any sort of gro@@ w@@ ing star@@ tu@@ p organ@@ iz@@ ation , we are sort of over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed by our gro@@ w@@ th , and that means we &apos;re getting en@@ or@@ m@@ ous qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ty of wh@@ i@@ st@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ er disc@@ l@@ os@@ u@@ res of a very hi@@ gh c@@ ali@@ b@@ er but don &apos;t have enough people to actually pro@@ cess and v@@ et this information ."
"C@@ A : So that &apos;s the k@@ ey bot@@ tl@@ en@@ ec@@ k , bas@@ ically j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and / or the f@@ und@@ ing of j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies ?"
"J@@ A : Y@@ ep . Y@@ ea@@ h , and tr@@ u@@ st@@ ed people ."
"I mean , we &apos;re an organ@@ iz@@ ation that is hard to gro@@ w very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly because of the sort of mat@@ eri@@ al we de@@ al with , so we have to re@@ struc@@ ture in or@@ der to have people who will de@@ al with the high@@ est na@@ tional sec@@ ur@@ ity stu@@ ff , and then low@@ er sec@@ ur@@ ity ca@@ ses ."
C@@ A : So help us understand a bit about you per@@ s@@ on@@ ally and how you came to do this .
And I think I re@@ ad that as a k@@ id you went to 3@@ 7 different sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s .
C@@ an that be right ?
"J@@ A : W@@ ell , my par@@ ents were in the mo@@ vi@@ e bus@@ iness and then on the ru@@ n from a cul@@ t , so the com@@ b@@ in@@ ation between the two ..@@ ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A : I mean , a p@@ sy@@ cho@@ lo@@ g@@ ist might say that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for bre@@ e@@ ding par@@ an@@ o@@ i@@ a ."
"J@@ A : What , the mo@@ vi@@ e bus@@ iness ?"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) C@@ A : And you were also — I mean , you were also a h@@ ac@@ k@@ er at an ear@@ ly age and r@@ an into the au@@ th@@ or@@ i@@ ties ear@@ ly on ."
"J@@ A : W@@ ell , I was a j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist ."
"You know , I was a very y@@ oun@@ g j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st at an ear@@ ly age ."
"I wr@@ ot@@ e a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine , was pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted for it when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er ."
So you have to be car@@ e@@ ful with h@@ ac@@ k@@ er .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a me@@ th@@ od that can be de@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ed for v@@ ari@@ ous things .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , at the mom@@ ent , it &apos;s m@@ os@@ tly de@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ed by the R@@ us@@ si@@ an ma@@ fi@@ a in or@@ der to ste@@ al your gr@@ and@@ mo@@ ther &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts ."
"So this ph@@ r@@ ase is not , not as n@@ ice as it used to be ."
"C@@ A : Y@@ ea@@ h , well , I cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ al@@ ing any@@ one &apos;s gr@@ and@@ mo@@ ther &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t , but what about your c@@ ore val@@ u@@ es ?"
C@@ an you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent in your life that hel@@ p@@ ed de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not s@@ ure about the in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent .
"But the c@@ ore val@@ u@@ es : well , cap@@ able , gener@@ ous m@@ en do not create v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ."
"And that &apos;s something from my fa@@ ther and something from other cap@@ able , gener@@ ous m@@ en that have been in my life ."
"C@@ A : C@@ ap@@ able , gener@@ ous m@@ en do not create v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ?"
"J@@ A : Y@@ ea@@ h . And you know , I &apos;m a com@@ ba@@ tive person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the n@@ ur@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , which is to poli@@ ce per@@ pe@@ tr@@ at@@ ors of cri@@ me ."
And so that is something that has been in my ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter for a long time .
"C@@ A : So just tell us , very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly in the last min@@ ut@@ e , the story : what happened in I@@ c@@ el@@ and ?"
"You bas@@ ically publi@@ sh@@ ed something there , r@@ an into tr@@ ou@@ ble with a b@@ ank , then the ne@@ ws ser@@ v@@ ice there was in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ ted from r@@ un@@ ning the story ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , they publi@@ ci@@ z@@ ed your side ."
That made you very high@@ -@@ pro@@ fi@@ le in I@@ c@@ el@@ and . What happened next ?
"J@@ A : Y@@ ea@@ h , this is a great ca@@ se , you know ."
I@@ c@@ el@@ and went through this fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al cri@@ s@@ is .
It was the h@@ ar@@ d@@ est h@@ it of any country in the world .
I@@ ts b@@ an@@ king sec@@ t@@ or was 10 times the G@@ D@@ P of the re@@ st of the econom@@ y .

"And there was a fe@@ el@@ ing in the comm@@ unity that that should never happ@@ en again , and as a res@@ ult , working with I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans and some other inter@@ na@@ tional le@@ g@@ al exper@@ ts , we put together a new sort of p@@ ac@@ k@@ age of le@@ g@@ is@@ l@@ ation for I@@ c@@ el@@ and to sort of become an off@@ sh@@ ore ha@@ ven for the f@@ ree pres@@ s , with the str@@ on@@ g@@ est j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic prot@@ ec@@ tions in the world , with a new No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for f@@ re@@ e@@ do@@ m of spe@@ ec@@ h ."
"I@@ c@@ el@@ and &apos;s a N@@ or@@ di@@ c country , so , like N@@ or@@ way , it &apos;s able to ta@@ p into the system ."
"And just a mon@@ th ago , this was p@@ as@@ s@@ ed by the I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ am@@ ent un@@ an@@ im@@ ous@@ ly ."

"The ob@@ j@@ ect on the right is made from a con@@ f@@ ec@@ tion of different su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ces , from si@@ li@@ c@@ on and me@@ t@@ al and pl@@ as@@ tic and so on ."
"And more than that , it &apos;s a con@@ f@@ ec@@ tion of different ide@@ as , the idea of pl@@ as@@ tic , the idea of a l@@ as@@ er , the idea of tran@@ si@@ stor@@ s ."
They &apos;ve all been com@@ b@@ in@@ ed together in this technology .
"And it &apos;s this com@@ b@@ in@@ ation , this c@@ um@@ ul@@ a@@ tive technology , that in@@ tri@@ gu@@ es me , because I think it &apos;s the sec@@ re@@ t to underst@@ an@@ ding what &apos;s happen@@ ing in the world ."
"M@@ y body &apos;s an ac@@ c@@ um@@ ul@@ ation of ide@@ as too : the idea of sk@@ in c@@ ells , the idea of brain c@@ ells , the idea of li@@ ver c@@ ells ."
They &apos;ve come together .

It &apos;s a uni@@ qu@@ e human fe@@ at@@ ure .

You can te@@ ach them in the l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory to do a little bit of ex@@ change — and in@@ de@@ ed there &apos;s re@@ ci@@ pro@@ city in other an@@ im@@ als — But the ex@@ change of one ob@@ j@@ ect for another never happen@@ s .

"But the differ@@ ence is that these cul@@ tu@@ res never exp@@ and , never gro@@ w , never ac@@ c@@ um@@ ul@@ ate , never become com@@ b@@ in@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ al , and the reas@@ on is because there is no se@@ x , as it were , there is no ex@@ change of ide@@ as ."
C@@ hi@@ mp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e t@@ ro@@ op@@ s have different cul@@ tu@@ res in different t@@ ro@@ op@@ s .
There &apos;s no ex@@ change of ide@@ as between them .
And why does ex@@ change ra@@ i@@ se li@@ ving st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds ?
"Well , the an@@ sw@@ er came from Da@@ vi@@ d R@@ ic@@ ar@@ do in 18@@ 1@@ 7 ."
"And here is a St@@ one A@@ ge ver@@ sion of his story , al@@ th@@ ough he to@@ ld it in ter@@ ms of tra@@ de between coun@@ tries ."
Ad@@ am ta@@ kes four h@@ our@@ s to make a spe@@ ar and three h@@ our@@ s to make an ax@@ e .
O@@ z ta@@ kes one h@@ our to make a spe@@ ar and two h@@ our@@ s to make an ax@@ e .
So O@@ z is better at bot@@ h spe@@ ars and ax@@ es than Ad@@ am .
He doesn &apos;t need Ad@@ am .
He can make his own spe@@ ars and ax@@ es .
"Well no , because if you think about it , if O@@ z ma@@ kes two spe@@ ars and Ad@@ am make two ax@@ es , and then they tra@@ de , then they will each have sa@@ ved an h@@ our of work ."
"And the more they do this , the more tr@@ ue it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better Ad@@ am is going to get at making ax@@ es and the better O@@ z is going to get at making spe@@ ars ."
So the ga@@ ins from tra@@ de are only going to gro@@ w .
"And this is one of the be@@ au@@ ties of ex@@ change , is it actually cre@@ ates the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m for more sp@@ eci@@ aliz@@ ation , which cre@@ ates the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m for more ex@@ change and so on ."
Ad@@ am and O@@ z bot@@ h sa@@ ved an h@@ our of time .
"That is pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity , the sa@@ ving of time in sa@@ ti@@ s@@ f@@ ying your nee@@ ds ."
A@@ s@@ k y@@ our@@ self how long you would have to work to pro@@ vi@@ de for y@@ our@@ self an h@@ our of read@@ ing light this ev@@ en@@ ing to re@@ ad a book by .

You find a sh@@ e@@ ep . You k@@ ill it . You get the f@@ at out of it .
"You r@@ en@@ der it down . You make a c@@ and@@ le , et@@ c@@ . et@@ c ."
How long is it going to take you ? Qu@@ ite a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to ear@@ n an h@@ our of read@@ ing light if you &apos;re on the a@@ ver@@ age w@@ age in Br@@ it@@ a@@ in today ?

We &apos;re able to d@@ ra@@ w up@@ on sp@@ eci@@ aliz@@ ation and ex@@ change to ra@@ i@@ se each other &apos;s li@@ ving st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds .
"Now , you do get other an@@ im@@ als working for each other too ."
An@@ ts are a cl@@ as@@ si@@ c example ; wor@@ k@@ ers work for qu@@ e@@ en@@ s and qu@@ e@@ en@@ s work for wor@@ k@@ ers .
"But there &apos;s a big differ@@ ence , which is that it only happen@@ s with@@ in the col@@ on@@ y ."
There &apos;s no working for each other ac@@ r@@ oss the col@@ on@@ ies .
And the reas@@ on for that is because there &apos;s a re@@ produc@@ tive di@@ vi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or .
"That is to say , they sp@@ eci@@ aliz@@ e with resp@@ ect to re@@ produc@@ tion ."
The qu@@ een does it all .
"In our spec@@ ies , we don &apos;t like doing that ."
"It &apos;s the one thing we in@@ si@@ st on doing for our@@ selves , is re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven in En@@ gl@@ and , we don &apos;t lea@@ ve re@@ produc@@ tion to the Qu@@ een ."
( Applause ) So when did this ha@@ bit start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think , prob@@ ably , the ol@@ d@@ est ver@@ sion of this is prob@@ ably the se@@ xu@@ al di@@ vi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or ."
But I &apos;ve got no e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence for that .
It just loo@@ ks like the first thing we did was work m@@ ale for fe@@ m@@ ale and fe@@ m@@ ale for m@@ ale .
"In all h@@ un@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ er soci@@ e@@ ties today , there &apos;s a for@@ ag@@ ing di@@ vi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or between , on the whole , h@@ un@@ ting m@@ al@@ es and ga@@ ther@@ ing fe@@ m@@ al@@ es ."
"It is@@ n &apos;t always quite that si@@ mple , but there &apos;s a di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tion between sp@@ eci@@ aliz@@ ed ro@@ l@@ es for m@@ al@@ es and fe@@ m@@ al@@ es ."
And the be@@ au@@ ty of this system is that it b@@ en@@ ef@@ its bot@@ h si@@ des .
"The wom@@ an kno@@ ws that , in the H@@ ad@@ z@@ as &apos; ca@@ se here — di@@ gg@@ ing ro@@ ots to sh@@ are with m@@ en in ex@@ change for me@@ at — she kno@@ ws that all she has to do to get ac@@ cess to prot@@ e@@ in is to di@@ g some ex@@ tr@@ a ro@@ ots and tra@@ de them for me@@ at ."
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ing h@@ un@@ t and try and k@@ ill a war@@ th@@ o@@ g .
And the man kno@@ ws that he doesn &apos;t have to do any di@@ gg@@ ing to get ro@@ ots .
A@@ ll he has to do is make s@@ ure that when he k@@ ill@@ s a war@@ th@@ o@@ g it &apos;s big enough to sh@@ are some .
And so bot@@ h si@@ des ra@@ i@@ se each other &apos;s st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of li@@ ving through the se@@ xu@@ al di@@ vi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or .
"When did this happ@@ en ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s pos@@ sible that Ne@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do this ."
They were a high@@ ly co@@ op@@ er@@ a@@ tive spec@@ ies .
They were a high@@ ly int@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ ent spec@@ ies .
"Th@@ e@@ ir bra@@ ins on a@@ ver@@ age , by the end , were bi@@ gg@@ er than y@@ our@@ s and m@@ ine in this room today ."
They were ima@@ gin@@ a@@ tive . They bu@@ ri@@ ed their de@@ ad .
"They had l@@ an@@ gu@@ age , prob@@ ably , because we know they had the F@@ O@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gen@@ e of the same kind as us , which was disc@@ over@@ ed here in Ox@@ for@@ d ."
And so it loo@@ ks like they prob@@ ably had l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic sk@@ ill@@ s .
They were b@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the Ne@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ als .
But there &apos;s no e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence of a se@@ xu@@ al di@@ vi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or .
There &apos;s no e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence of ga@@ ther@@ ing be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or by fe@@ m@@ al@@ es .
It loo@@ ks like the fe@@ m@@ al@@ es were co@@ op@@ er@@ a@@ tive h@@ un@@ ters with the m@@ en .
"And the other thing there &apos;s no e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence for is ex@@ change between grou@@ ps , because the ob@@ j@@ ects that you find in Ne@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ al re@@ ma@@ ins , the to@@ ol@@ s they made , are always made from lo@@ cal mat@@ eri@@ als ."
"F@@ or example , in the C@@ au@@ ca@@ su@@ s there &apos;s a s@@ ite where you find lo@@ cal Ne@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ al to@@ ol@@ s ."
They &apos;re always made from lo@@ cal ch@@ er@@ t .
"In the same val@@ le@@ y there are mo@@ der@@ n human re@@ ma@@ ins from about the same d@@ ate , 30@@ ,000 years ago , and some of those are from lo@@ cal ch@@ er@@ t , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ si@@ di@@ an from a long way away ."
"And when human be@@ ings be@@ g@@ an mo@@ ving ob@@ j@@ ects around like this , it was e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence that they were ex@@ chan@@ ging between grou@@ ps ."
T@@ ra@@ de is 10 times as old as f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing .
Pe@@ ople for@@ get that . Pe@@ ople think of tra@@ de as a mo@@ der@@ n thing .
Ex@@ change between grou@@ ps has been going on for a h@@ und@@ red thou@@ s@@ and years .
"And the ear@@ li@@ est e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence for it c@@ ro@@ ps up some@@ where between 8@@ 0 and 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ago in Afri@@ c@@ a , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and j@@ as@@ p@@ er and other things mo@@ ving long di@@ st@@ an@@ ces in E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ i@@ a ."
You also see se@@ as@@ h@@ ells — as disc@@ over@@ ed by a te@@ am here in Ox@@ for@@ d — mo@@ ving 1@@ 2@@ 5 mil@@ es in@@ l@@ and from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ r@@ an@@ e@@ an in Al@@ g@@ eri@@ a .
And that &apos;s e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence that people have started ex@@ chan@@ ging between grou@@ ps .
And that will have l@@ ed to sp@@ eci@@ aliz@@ ation .
How do you know that l@@ on@@ g-@@ di@@ st@@ ance mo@@ v@@ ement means tra@@ de ra@@ ther than mi@@ gra@@ tion ?
"Well , you look at mo@@ der@@ n h@@ un@@ ter ga@@ ther@@ ers like ab@@ or@@ ig@@ in@@ als , who qu@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed for st@@ one ax@@ es at a place called M@@ oun@@ t Is@@ a , which was a qu@@ ar@@ ry ow@@ ned by the K@@ al@@ k@@ a@@ do@@ on tri@@ be ."
"They tra@@ ded them with their ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors for things like st@@ in@@ gr@@ ay b@@ ar@@ b@@ s , and the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence was that st@@ one ax@@ es en@@ ded up over a lar@@ ge part of Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a ."
"So l@@ on@@ g-@@ di@@ st@@ ance mo@@ v@@ ement of to@@ ol@@ s is a si@@ g@@ n of tra@@ de , not mi@@ gra@@ tion ."
"Wh@@ at happen@@ s when you c@@ ut people off from ex@@ change , from the ab@@ ility to ex@@ change and sp@@ eci@@ aliz@@ e ?"
"And the an@@ sw@@ er is that not only do you s@@ low down techno@@ logi@@ cal pro@@ gre@@ s@@ s , you can actually th@@ ro@@ w it into re@@ ver@@ se ."
A@@ n example is T@@ as@@ man@@ i@@ a .
"When the se@@ a le@@ vel r@@ ose and T@@ as@@ man@@ i@@ a be@@ came an is@@ l@@ and 10@@ ,000 years ago , the people on it not only experi@@ en@@ c@@ ed s@@ low@@ er pro@@ gre@@ s@@ s than people on the ma@@ in@@ l@@ and , they actually experi@@ en@@ c@@ ed re@@ gre@@ s@@ s ."
"They ga@@ ve up the ab@@ ility to make st@@ one to@@ ol@@ s and fi@@ sh@@ ing e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment and c@@ lo@@ thing because the p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation of about 4@@ ,000 people was si@@ mp@@ ly not lar@@ ge enough to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the sp@@ eci@@ aliz@@ ed sk@@ ill@@ s nec@@ ess@@ ary to ke@@ ep the technology they had ."
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a des@@ er@@ t is@@ l@@ and .
"H@@ ow many of the things in our po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts could we cont@@ in@@ ue to make after 10@@ ,000 years ?"
"It didn &apos;t happ@@ en in Ti@@ er@@ r@@ a de@@ l F@@ u@@ e@@ go — si@@ mil@@ ar is@@ l@@ and , si@@ mil@@ ar people ."
"The reas@@ on : because Ti@@ er@@ r@@ a de@@ l F@@ u@@ e@@ go is se@@ par@@ ated from S@@ ou@@ th Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a by a much n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w@@ er st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght , and there was tra@@ ding cont@@ act ac@@ r@@ oss that st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out 10@@ ,000 years ."
The T@@ as@@ man@@ i@@ ans were is@@ ol@@ ated .
"G@@ o back to this ima@@ ge again and as@@ k y@@ our@@ self , not only who made it and for who , but who k@@ new how to make it ."
"In the ca@@ se of the st@@ one ax@@ e , the man who made it k@@ new how to make it ."
But who kno@@ ws how to make a compu@@ ter m@@ ou@@ se ?
"N@@ o@@ body , lit@@ er@@ ally no@@ body ."
There is no@@ body on the plan@@ et who kno@@ ws how to make a compu@@ ter m@@ ou@@ se .
I mean this quite s@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly .
The pre@@ si@@ d@@ ent of the compu@@ ter m@@ ou@@ se comp@@ any doesn &apos;t know .
He just kno@@ ws how to ru@@ n a comp@@ any .
"The person on the as@@ se@@ mb@@ ly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to dri@@ ll an o@@ il well to get o@@ il out to make pl@@ as@@ tic , and so on ."
"We all know little b@@ its , but n@@ one of us kno@@ ws the whole ."
"I am of course quot@@ ing from a fam@@ ous es@@ say by Le@@ on@@ ard Re@@ ad , the econom@@ ist in the 19@@ 50@@ s , called &quot; &quot; I , P@@ en@@ ci@@ l &quot; &quot; in which he wr@@ ot@@ e about how a p@@ en@@ ci@@ l came to be made , and how no@@ body kno@@ ws even how to make a p@@ en@@ ci@@ l , because the people who as@@ se@@ m@@ ble it don &apos;t know how to m@@ ine grap@@ h@@ ite , and they don &apos;t know how to f@@ ell tre@@ es and that kind of thing ."
"And what we &apos;ve done in human soci@@ e@@ ty , through ex@@ change and sp@@ eci@@ aliz@@ ation , is we &apos;ve cre@@ ated the ab@@ ility to do things that we don &apos;t even understand ."
It &apos;s not the same with l@@ an@@ gu@@ age .
W@@ ith l@@ an@@ gu@@ age we have to tran@@ s@@ f@@ er ide@@ as that we understand with each other .
"But with technology , we can actually do things that are be@@ y@@ on@@ d our cap@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties ."
We &apos;ve g@@ one be@@ y@@ on@@ d the cap@@ ac@@ ity of the human m@@ ind to an ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary de@@ gre@@ e .
"And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons that I &apos;m not interest@@ ed in the de@@ b@@ ate about I.@@ Q@@ . , about whe@@ ther some grou@@ ps have high@@ er I.@@ Q.@@ s than other grou@@ ps ."
It &apos;s comple@@ tely ir@@ re@@ le@@ v@@ ant .
"Wh@@ at &apos;s re@@ le@@ v@@ ant to a soci@@ e@@ ty is how well people are comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ ting their ide@@ as , and how well they &apos;re co@@ op@@ er@@ ating , not how c@@ le@@ ver the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als are ."
So we &apos;ve cre@@ ated something called the coll@@ ec@@ tive brain .
We &apos;re just the no@@ des in the ne@@ t@@ work .
We &apos;re the ne@@ ur@@ ons in this brain .
"It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ide@@ as , the me@@ e@@ ting and mat@@ ing of ide@@ as between them , that is ca@@ using techno@@ logi@@ cal pro@@ gre@@ s@@ s , incre@@ m@@ ent@@ ally , bit by bit ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , b@@ ad things happ@@ en ."
"And in the future , as we go for@@ w@@ ard , we will , of course , experi@@ ence ter@@ ri@@ ble things ."
There will be w@@ ars ; there will be de@@ pres@@ si@@ ons ; there will be nat@@ ur@@ al di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers .
"A@@ w@@ ful things will happ@@ en in this c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y , I &apos;m ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tely s@@ ure ."
"But I &apos;m also s@@ ure that , because of the con@@ nec@@ tions people are making , and the ab@@ ility of ide@@ as to me@@ et and to m@@ ate as never before , I &apos;m also s@@ ure that technology will ad@@ v@@ ance , and ther@@ ef@@ ore li@@ ving st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds will ad@@ v@@ ance ."
"@@ Because through the cl@@ ou@@ d , through c@@ ro@@ w@@ d s@@ our@@ c@@ ing , through the bot@@ t@@ om@@ -@@ up world that we &apos;ve cre@@ ated , where not just the el@@ it@@ es but every@@ body is able to have their ide@@ as and make them me@@ et and m@@ ate , we are su@@ re@@ ly ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ating the r@@ ate of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ."

This is the real c@@ ool part . It &apos;s called C@@ oll@@ ec@@ tions .

"So I think , in con@@ cl@@ us@@ i@@ on , for me , the ma@@ in thing is that all the a@@ ma@@ zing stu@@ ff here does not really come from G@@ oo@@ g@@ le ."
"It doesn &apos;t , in my op@@ in@@ i@@ on , even come from the mus@@ e@@ um@@ s ."
I prob@@ ably sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t say that .

"O@@ u@@ r ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood was ful@@ l of lar@@ ge fami@@ li@@ es , where fa@@ th@@ ers were the he@@ a@@ ds of h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ ds , so I gre@@ w up see@@ ing my mo@@ ther as a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce@@ e in a p@@ at@@ ri@@ ar@@ c@@ ha@@ l en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment ."
"In fact , I gre@@ w up ob@@ ser@@ ving two different k@@ in@@ ds of wom@@ an@@ h@@ ood ."
"O@@ n the one h@@ and was my mo@@ ther , a w@@ ell@@ -@@ e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted , sec@@ ular , mo@@ der@@ n , we@@ st@@ er@@ n@@ iz@@ ed , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish wom@@ an ."
"O@@ n the other h@@ and was my gr@@ and@@ mo@@ ther , who also took c@@ are of me and was more sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al , less e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted and de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely less ra@@ tional ."
This was a wom@@ an who re@@ ad co@@ ff@@ e@@ e gr@@ oun@@ ds to see the future and m@@ el@@ ted le@@ ad into my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous sh@@ ap@@ es to f@@ end off the e@@ vi@@ l ey@@ e .
"M@@ any people vi@@ s@@ ited my gr@@ and@@ mo@@ ther , people with se@@ v@@ ere ac@@ n@@ e on their fac@@ es or war@@ ts on their h@@ ands ."
"E@@ ach time , my gr@@ and@@ mo@@ ther would ut@@ ter some wor@@ ds in Ar@@ ab@@ ic , take a red app@@ le and sta@@ b it with as many r@@ ose th@@ or@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to re@@ mo@@ ve ."
"Th@@ en one by one , she would en@@ c@@ ir@@ c@@ le these th@@ or@@ ns with d@@ ar@@ k in@@ k ."
"@@ A we@@ e@@ k l@@ ater , the pa@@ ti@@ ent would come back for a f@@ ol@@ low@@ -@@ up ex@@ am@@ in@@ ation ."
"Now , I &apos;m aw@@ are that I should not be sa@@ ying s@@ uch things in fr@@ on@@ t of an au@@ di@@ ence of sch@@ ol@@ ars and sci@@ enti@@ sts , but the tr@@ u@@ th is , of all the people who vi@@ s@@ ited my gr@@ and@@ mo@@ ther for their sk@@ in con@@ di@@ tions , I did not see any@@ one go back un@@ happ@@ y or un@@ heal@@ ed ."
I as@@ ked her how she did this . W@@ as it the power of p@@ ra@@ ying ?
"In resp@@ on@@ se she said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , p@@ ra@@ ying is eff@@ ec@@ tive , but also be@@ w@@ are of the power of c@@ ir@@ cl@@ es . &quot; &quot; F@@ rom her , I lear@@ ned , am@@ on@@ g@@ st many other things , one very pre@@ ci@@ ous l@@ ess@@ on — that if you want to de@@ st@@ ro@@ y something in this life , be it an ac@@ n@@ e , a b@@ le@@ m@@ ish or the human s@@ ou@@ l , all you need to do is to sur@@ r@@ ound it with th@@ ic@@ k w@@ all@@ s ."
It will dr@@ y up in@@ side .
Now we all live in some kind of a soci@@ al and cul@@ tur@@ al c@@ ir@@ c@@ le .
We all do .
"We &apos;re bor@@ n into a cer@@ ta@@ in fami@@ ly , n@@ ation , cl@@ as@@ s ."
"But if we have no con@@ nec@@ tion wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever with the wor@@ l@@ ds be@@ y@@ on@@ d the one we take for gr@@ an@@ ted , then we too ru@@ n the ri@@ s@@ k of dr@@ ying up in@@ side ."
"O@@ u@@ r ima@@ gin@@ ation might sh@@ r@@ in@@ k ; our he@@ ar@@ ts might d@@ w@@ in@@ d@@ le , and our hum@@ an@@ n@@ ess might wi@@ ther if we st@@ ay for too long in@@ side our cul@@ tur@@ al co@@ co@@ ons ."
"O@@ u@@ r fri@@ en@@ ds , ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors , col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es , fami@@ ly — if all the people in our in@@ n@@ er c@@ ir@@ c@@ le re@@ se@@ m@@ ble us , it means we are sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded with our m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r ima@@ ge ."
Now one other thing women like my gr@@ and@@ m@@ a do in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey is to co@@ ver m@@ ir@@ r@@ ors with vel@@ v@@ et or to h@@ an@@ g them on the w@@ all@@ s with their bac@@ ks fac@@ ing out .
It &apos;s an old E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n tra@@ di@@ tion bas@@ ed on the kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge that it &apos;s not heal@@ th@@ y for a human being to sp@@ end too much time star@@ ing at his own re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion .
"I@@ r@@ on@@ ically , &#9@@ 1@@ ; li@@ ving in &#9@@ 3@@ ; comm@@ uni@@ ties of the li@@ ke@@ -@@ min@@ ded is one of the gre@@ at@@ est d@@ an@@ g@@ ers of today &apos;s g@@ lob@@ aliz@@ ed world ."
"And it &apos;s happen@@ ing every@@ where , am@@ ong li@@ b@@ er@@ als and con@@ ser@@ va@@ ti@@ ves , ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic@@ s and beli@@ e@@ ver@@ s , the ri@@ ch and the po@@ or , E@@ ast and W@@ est ali@@ ke ."

"In my op@@ in@@ i@@ on , one way of tran@@ sc@@ en@@ ding these cul@@ tur@@ al gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is through the art of stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ ing ."
"S@@ t@@ or@@ ies can@@ not de@@ mo@@ li@@ s@@ h fr@@ on@@ ti@@ ers , but they can p@@ un@@ ch h@@ ol@@ es in our m@@ ent@@ al w@@ all@@ s ."
"And through those h@@ ol@@ es , we can get a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of the other , and some@@ times even like what we see ."
I started wr@@ iting f@@ ic@@ tion at the age of ei@@ ght .
M@@ y mo@@ ther came home one day with a tur@@ qu@@ o@@ i@@ se n@@ ot@@ e@@ book and as@@ ked me if I &apos;d be interest@@ ed in ke@@ ep@@ ing a per@@ s@@ on@@ al j@@ our@@ n@@ al .
"In re@@ tr@@ os@@ p@@ ect , I think she was s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly wor@@ ri@@ ed about my s@@ an@@ ity ."
"I was con@@ st@@ an@@ tly t@@ ell@@ ing stor@@ ies at home , which was good , ex@@ cep@@ t I to@@ ld this to ima@@ gin@@ ary fri@@ en@@ ds around me , which was not so good ."
"I was an int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ted chil@@ d , to the point of comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ ting with co@@ lo@@ red c@@ ra@@ y@@ ons and ap@@ o@@ logi@@ zing to ob@@ j@@ ects when I bu@@ mp@@ ed into them , so my mo@@ ther thought it might do me good to wr@@ ite down my d@@ ay@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day experi@@ en@@ ces and e@@ mo@@ tions ."
"Wh@@ at she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was ter@@ ri@@ b@@ ly bor@@ ing , and the last thing I wanted to do was to wr@@ ite about my@@ self ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I be@@ g@@ an to wr@@ ite about people other than me and things that never really happened ."
And th@@ us be@@ g@@ an my li@@ fe@@ -@@ long p@@ as@@ sion for wr@@ iting f@@ ic@@ tion .
"So from the very be@@ gin@@ ning , f@@ ic@@ tion for me was less of an au@@ to@@ bi@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ cal man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation than a tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ent@@ al j@@ our@@ ne@@ y into other li@@ ves , other pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties ."
And p@@ le@@ ase be@@ ar with me : I &apos;ll d@@ ra@@ w a c@@ ir@@ c@@ le and come back to this point .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
M@@ y mo@@ ther be@@ came a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at .
"So from this small , su@@ per@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous , mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ cl@@ as@@ s ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood of my gr@@ and@@ mo@@ ther , I was z@@ o@@ om@@ ed into this pos@@ h , inter@@ na@@ tional school &#9@@ 1@@ ; in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d &#9@@ 3@@ ; , where I was the only T@@ ur@@ k ."
"It was here that I had my first en@@ coun@@ ter with what I call the &quot; &quot; re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tive fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n@@ er . &quot; &quot; I@@ n our cl@@ as@@ s@@ room , there were children from all na@@ tion@@ ali@@ ties , ye@@ t this di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity did not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly le@@ ad to a c@@ os@@ m@@ op@@ ol@@ it@@ an , eg@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an cl@@ as@@ s@@ room de@@ mo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , it gener@@ ated an at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here in which each chil@@ d was se@@ en — not as an in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al on his own , but as the re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of something lar@@ ger ."
"We were like a min@@ i@@ at@@ ure Un@@ ited N@@ ations , which was fu@@ n , ex@@ cep@@ t wh@@ en@@ ever something ne@@ ga@@ tive , with re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds to a n@@ ation or a re@@ li@@ gi@@ on , took place ."
"The chil@@ d who re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted it was mo@@ c@@ ked , ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ed and b@@ ul@@ li@@ ed end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly ."
"And I should know , because d@@ ur@@ ing the time I at@@ ten@@ ded that school , a mil@@ it@@ ary ta@@ ke@@ over happened in my country , a g@@ un@@ man of my na@@ tion@@ ality ne@@ ar@@ ly k@@ ill@@ ed the P@@ op@@ e , and T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey got z@@ er@@ o po@@ in@@ ts in &#9@@ 1@@ ; the &#9@@ 3@@ ; Eu@@ ro@@ vi@@ sion S@@ ong C@@ on@@ t@@ est ."
( Laughter ) I s@@ ki@@ pp@@ ed school of@@ ten and dre@@ am@@ ed of be@@ coming a sa@@ il@@ or d@@ ur@@ ing those d@@ ays .
I also had my first ta@@ st@@ e of cul@@ tur@@ al st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es there .
"The other children as@@ ked me about the mo@@ vi@@ e &quot; &quot; M@@ id@@ ni@@ ght Ex@@ pres@@ s , &quot; &quot; which I had not se@@ en ; they in@@ qu@@ i@@ red how many ci@@ g@@ ar@@ et@@ t@@ es a day I s@@ mo@@ ked , because they thought all T@@ ur@@ ks were he@@ av@@ y s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers , and they w@@ on@@ der@@ ed at what age I would start co@@ ver@@ ing my ha@@ ir ."
"I came to lear@@ n that these were the three ma@@ in st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about my country : poli@@ tic@@ s , ci@@ g@@ ar@@ et@@ t@@ es and the ve@@ il ."
"A@@ f@@ ter S@@ pa@@ in , we went to J@@ or@@ d@@ an , G@@ er@@ many and An@@ k@@ ar@@ a again ."
"E@@ very@@ where I went , I f@@ el@@ t like my ima@@ gin@@ ation was the only su@@ it@@ ca@@ se I could take with me ."
"S@@ t@@ or@@ ies ga@@ ve me a sense of cen@@ ter , cont@@ in@@ u@@ ity and co@@ h@@ er@@ ence , the three big C@@ s that I o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se l@@ ac@@ ked ."
"In my mi@@ d-@@ tw@@ enti@@ es , I mo@@ ved to I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , the city I ad@@ ore ."
"I li@@ ved in a very vi@@ br@@ ant , di@@ ver@@ se ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood where I wr@@ ot@@ e se@@ ver@@ al of my no@@ vel@@ s ."
I was in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l when the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke h@@ it in 19@@ 9@@ 9 .
"When I r@@ an out of the buil@@ ding at three in the mor@@ ning , I sa@@ w something that st@@ opp@@ ed me in my tr@@ ac@@ ks ."
"There was the lo@@ cal gro@@ c@@ er there — a gr@@ u@@ mp@@ y , old man who didn &apos;t s@@ ell al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and didn &apos;t spe@@ a@@ k to mar@@ gin@@ als ."
He was s@@ it@@ ting next to a tran@@ s@@ v@@ es@@ ti@@ te with a long bl@@ ack wi@@ g and ma@@ sc@@ ar@@ a r@@ un@@ ning down her ch@@ e@@ e@@ ks .
"I w@@ at@@ ch@@ ed the man op@@ en a p@@ ack of ci@@ g@@ ar@@ et@@ t@@ es with tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ing h@@ ands and off@@ er one to her , and that is the ima@@ ge of the ni@@ ght of the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke in my m@@ ind today — a con@@ ser@@ va@@ tive gro@@ c@@ er and a cr@@ ying tran@@ s@@ v@@ es@@ ti@@ te s@@ mo@@ king together on the si@@ de@@ wal@@ k ."
"In the face of de@@ ath and de@@ struc@@ tion , our m@@ und@@ an@@ e differ@@ en@@ ces ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated , and we all be@@ came one even if for a few h@@ our@@ s ."
"But I &apos;ve always beli@@ ev@@ ed that stor@@ ies , too , have a si@@ mil@@ ar eff@@ ect on us ."
"I &apos;m not sa@@ ying that f@@ ic@@ tion has the ma@@ gn@@ it@@ u@@ de of an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke , but when we are read@@ ing a good no@@ vel , we lea@@ ve our small , co@@ z@@ y ap@@ ar@@ t@@ m@@ ents be@@ h@@ ind , go out into the ni@@ ght al@@ one and start getting to know people we had never me@@ t before and per@@ h@@ ap@@ s had even been bi@@ as@@ ed aga@@ in@@ st ."
"S@@ h@@ ort@@ ly after , I went to a women &apos;s col@@ le@@ ge in B@@ os@@ t@@ on , then M@@ ic@@ hi@@ g@@ an ."
"I experi@@ en@@ c@@ ed this , not so much as a ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ cal shi@@ ft , as a l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic one ."
I started wr@@ iting f@@ ic@@ tion in En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h .
"I &apos;m not an im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e or ex@@ i@@ le — they as@@ k me why I do this — but the comm@@ ut@@ e between l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es gi@@ ves me the chan@@ ce to re@@ create my@@ self ."
"I love wr@@ iting in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , which to me is very po@@ e@@ tic and very e@@ mo@@ tional , and I love wr@@ iting in En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h , which to me is very ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical and cer@@ e@@ br@@ al ."
So I feel con@@ nec@@ ted to each l@@ an@@ gu@@ age in a different way .
"F@@ or me , like mil@@ li@@ ons of other people around the world today , En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h is an ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red l@@ an@@ gu@@ age ."
"When you &apos;re a l@@ at@@ ec@@ om@@ er to a l@@ an@@ gu@@ age , what happen@@ s is you live there with a cont@@ in@@ u@@ ous and per@@ pe@@ tu@@ al f@@ ru@@ st@@ ra@@ tion ."
"A@@ s l@@ at@@ ec@@ om@@ ers , we always want to say more , you know , cr@@ ack better jo@@ kes , say better things , but we end up sa@@ ying less because there &apos;s a ga@@ p between the m@@ ind and the t@@ on@@ gu@@ e ."
And that ga@@ p is very in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ating .
"But if we man@@ age not to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed by it , it &apos;s also sti@@ m@@ ul@@ ating ."
And this is what I disc@@ over@@ ed in B@@ os@@ t@@ on — that f@@ ru@@ st@@ ra@@ tion was very sti@@ m@@ ul@@ ating .
"A@@ t this st@@ age , my gr@@ and@@ mo@@ ther , who had been w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing the course of my life with incre@@ as@@ ing an@@ xi@@ e@@ ty , started to in@@ cl@@ u@@ de in her da@@ i@@ ly p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers that I ur@@ g@@ ently get mar@@ ri@@ ed so that I could se@@ t@@ tle down on@@ ce and for all ."
"And because G@@ od lo@@ ves her , I did get mar@@ ri@@ ed ."
"( Laughter ) But in@@ ste@@ ad of se@@ t@@ tl@@ ing down , I went to A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a ."
"And s@@ in@@ ce my h@@ us@@ b@@ and is in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , I started comm@@ u@@ ting between A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a and I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l — the two plac@@ es on the sur@@ face of ear@@ th that cou@@ ldn &apos;t be more different ."
"I gu@@ ess one part of me has always been a n@@ om@@ ad , ph@@ ys@@ ically and sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ ally ."
"S@@ t@@ or@@ ies ac@@ comp@@ any me , ke@@ ep@@ ing my piec@@ es and me@@ mor@@ ies together , like an ex@@ i@@ st@@ enti@@ al gl@@ ue ."
"Y@@ et as much as I love stor@@ ies , rec@@ ently , I &apos;ve also be@@ gu@@ n to think that they l@@ ose their ma@@ gi@@ c if and when a story is se@@ en as more than a story ."
And this is a su@@ bj@@ ect that I would love to think about together .
"When my first no@@ vel wr@@ it@@ ten in En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h came out in Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a , I he@@ ard an interesting re@@ mar@@ k from a lit@@ er@@ ary cri@@ tic ."
"@@ &quot; I li@@ ked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I w@@ ish you had wr@@ it@@ ten it differ@@ ently . &quot;"
( Laughter ) I as@@ ked him what he me@@ ant by that .
"H@@ e said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , look at it . There &apos;s so many Sp@@ an@@ ish , Am@@ eri@@ can , Hi@@ sp@@ an@@ ic ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ters in it , but there &apos;s only one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the no@@ vel took place on a uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity ca@@ mp@@ us in B@@ os@@ t@@ on , so to me , it was n@@ or@@ ma@@ l that there be more inter@@ na@@ tional ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ters in it than T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ters , but I underst@@ ood what my cri@@ tic was looking for ."
And I also underst@@ ood that I would ke@@ ep dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ting him .
He wanted to see the man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of my id@@ enti@@ ty .
He was looking for a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish wom@@ an in the book because I happened to be one .
"We of@@ ten talk about how stor@@ ies change the world , but we should also see how the world of id@@ enti@@ ty poli@@ tic@@ s a@@ ff@@ ects the way stor@@ ies are being c@@ ir@@ cul@@ ated , re@@ ad and re@@ vi@@ ew@@ ed ."
"M@@ any au@@ th@@ ors feel this pres@@ s@@ ure , but n@@ on@@ -@@ W@@ est@@ er@@ n au@@ th@@ ors feel it more he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly ."
"If you &apos;re a wom@@ an wr@@ it@@ er from the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , like me , then you are exp@@ ec@@ ted to wr@@ ite the stor@@ ies of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women and , pre@@ f@@ er@@ ably , the un@@ happ@@ y stor@@ ies of un@@ happ@@ y M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"You &apos;re exp@@ ec@@ ted to wr@@ ite in@@ forma@@ tive , po@@ ig@@ n@@ ant and ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic stor@@ ies and lea@@ ve the exper@@ im@@ ent@@ al and av@@ an@@ t-@@ g@@ ar@@ de to your W@@ est@@ er@@ n col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es ."
What I experi@@ en@@ c@@ ed as a chil@@ d in that school in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d is happen@@ ing in the lit@@ er@@ ary world today .
"W@@ r@@ it@@ ers are not se@@ en as cre@@ a@@ tive in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als on their own , but as the re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves of their re@@ spec@@ tive cul@@ tu@@ res : a few au@@ th@@ ors from Ch@@ in@@ a , a few from T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey , a few from N@@ ig@@ eri@@ a ."
"We &apos;re all thought to have something very di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tive , if not p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar ."
The wr@@ it@@ er and comm@@ u@@ ter J@@ am@@ es B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in ga@@ ve an inter@@ vi@@ e@@ w in 19@@ 8@@ 4 in which he was re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly as@@ ked about his h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ ality .
"When the inter@@ vi@@ ew@@ er tri@@ ed to pi@@ ge@@ on@@ ho@@ le him as a g@@ ay wr@@ it@@ er , B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in st@@ opp@@ ed and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ?

There &apos;s a fu@@ zz@@ y ca@@ te@@ g@@ ory called m@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al lit@@ er@@ at@@ ure in which all au@@ th@@ ors from out@@ side the W@@ est@@ er@@ n world are l@@ u@@ mp@@ ed together .
"I never for@@ get my first m@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al read@@ ing , in H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard S@@ qu@@ are about 10 years ago ."
"We were three wr@@ it@@ ers , one from the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ in@@ es , one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish and one In@@ d@@ on@@ es@@ i@@ an — like a jo@@ ke , you know ."
( Laughter ) And the reas@@ on why we were br@@ ou@@ ght together was not because we sh@@ ar@@ ed an ar@@ ti@@ sti@@ c st@@ y@@ le or a lit@@ er@@ ary ta@@ st@@ e .
It was only because of our p@@ as@@ sp@@ or@@ ts .
"M@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al wr@@ it@@ ers are exp@@ ec@@ ted to tell real stor@@ ies , not so much the ima@@ gin@@ ary ."
A f@@ un@@ c@@ tion is at@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted to f@@ ic@@ tion .
"In this way , not only the wr@@ it@@ ers the@@ m@@ selves , but also their f@@ ic@@ tional ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ters become the re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves of something lar@@ ger ."
But I m@@ ust qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly ad@@ d that this ten@@ d@@ en@@ cy to see a story as more than a story does not so@@ le@@ ly come from the W@@ est .
It comes from every@@ where .
And I experi@@ en@@ c@@ ed this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and when I was put on tri@@ al in 2@@ 00@@ 5 for the wor@@ ds my f@@ ic@@ tional ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ters ut@@ ter@@ ed in a no@@ vel .

He didn &apos;t f@@ ol@@ low his p@@ as@@ sion .
He ste@@ pp@@ ed back and he w@@ at@@ ch@@ ed where every@@ body was going and he went the other way .

"A@@ n@@ y@@ how , a whole lot of things ."
I could talk at l@@ en@@ g@@ th about the many little di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tions we made and the end@@ less li@@ st of ways that I got it wr@@ ong .

"I form@@ ed a the@@ ory , and I &apos;m going to sh@@ are it now in my re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing two min@@ ut@@ es and 3@@ 0 secon@@ ds ."
"It go@@ es like this — we &apos;ve d@@ ec@@ lar@@ ed w@@ ar on work , as a soci@@ e@@ ty , all of us ."

"We didn &apos;t se@@ t out to do it and we didn &apos;t tw@@ ist our mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he in some M@@ ac@@ hi@@ a@@ vel@@ li@@ an way , but we &apos;ve done it ."
"And we &apos;ve w@@ ag@@ ed this w@@ ar on at le@@ ast four fr@@ on@@ ts , cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly in H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood ."
The way we p@@ or@@ tr@@ ay working people on T@@ V — it &apos;s l@@ au@@ g@@ ha@@ ble .
"If there &apos;s a pl@@ umb@@ er , he &apos;s 30@@ 0 p@@ oun@@ ds and he &apos;s got a gi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ t cr@@ ack . Ad@@ m@@ it it ."
You see him all the time .
"That &apos;s what pl@@ umb@@ ers look like , right ?"
"We tur@@ n them into h@@ er@@ o@@ es , or we tur@@ n them into p@@ un@@ ch l@@ in@@ es ."
That &apos;s what T@@ V does .
"We try hard on &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t ch@@ e@@ at ."
"But , we &apos;ve w@@ ag@@ ed this w@@ ar on Ma@@ di@@ son A@@ v@@ en@@ ue ."
"I mean , so many of the comm@@ er@@ ci@@ als that come out there — in the way of a m@@ ess@@ age , what &apos;s really being said ?"

W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on ? I can &apos;t even be@@ g@@ in to talk about the de@@ als and poli@@ ci@@ es in place that a@@ ff@@ ect the bot@@ to@@ m line re@@ ality of the a@@ va@@ il@@ able j@@ ob@@ s because I don &apos;t really know .

"And right here gu@@ ys , Si@@ li@@ c@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y , I mean — how many people have an i@@ Ph@@ one on them right now ?"
How many people have their Bl@@ ac@@ k@@ b@@ er@@ ri@@ es ?
We &apos;re pl@@ u@@ gg@@ ed in ; we &apos;re con@@ nec@@ ted .
I would never su@@ gg@@ est for a second that something b@@ ad has come out of the t@@ ec@@ h re@@ v@@ ol@@ ution .
"G@@ ood g@@ ri@@ e@@ f , not to this c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
( Laughter ) But I would su@@ gg@@ est that in@@ no@@ v@@ ation with@@ out im@@ it@@ ation is a comple@@ te wa@@ st@@ e of time .

"Y@@ our i@@ Ph@@ one with@@ out those people making the same inter@@ face , the same c@@ ir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry , the same bo@@ ard , over and over ?"
A@@ ll of that ? That &apos;s what ma@@ kes it e@@ qu@@ ally as pos@@ sible as the gen@@ i@@ us that go@@ es in@@ side of it .
"So , we &apos;ve got this new to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x , you know ."
Ou@@ r to@@ ol@@ s today don &apos;t look like sh@@ o@@ vel@@ s and pic@@ ks .
They look like the stu@@ ff we wal@@ k around with .
And so the coll@@ ec@@ tive eff@@ ect of all of that has been this mar@@ gin@@ aliz@@ ation of l@@ ots and l@@ ots of j@@ ob@@ s .
"And I re@@ aliz@@ ed , prob@@ ably too l@@ ate in this ga@@ me — I hop@@ e not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 20@@ 0 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can ."
"And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wr@@ ong about a lot of things , not just the t@@ es@@ ti@@ cl@@ es on my ch@@ in ."
I got a lot wr@@ ong .
"So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a P@@ R ca@@ mp@@ a@@ ig@@ n for work , man@@ u@@ al l@@ ab@@ or , sk@@ ill@@ ed l@@ ab@@ or ."
S@@ om@@ e@@ body nee@@ ds to be out there tal@@ king about the for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten b@@ en@@ ef@@ its .
"I &apos;m tal@@ king about gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther stu@@ ff , the stu@@ ff a lot us prob@@ ably gre@@ w up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of l@@ ost a little ."
B@@ ar@@ ack wan@@ ts to create two and a hal@@ f million j@@ ob@@ s .
The in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture is a hu@@ ge de@@ al .
"This w@@ ar on work , that I su@@ pp@@ ose ex@@ i@@ sts , has ca@@ su@@ al@@ ties like any other w@@ ar ."
The in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture &apos;s the first one ; d@@ ec@@ l@@ in@@ ing tra@@ de@@ -@@ school en@@ ro@@ ll@@ m@@ ents are the second one .
"E@@ very sing@@ le year : fe@@ w@@ er elec@@ tri@@ ci@@ ans , fe@@ w@@ er car@@ p@@ en@@ ters , fe@@ w@@ er pl@@ umb@@ ers , fe@@ w@@ er w@@ el@@ d@@ ers , fe@@ w@@ er pi@@ pe@@ f@@ it@@ ters , fe@@ w@@ er ste@@ am@@ f@@ it@@ ters ."
"The in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture j@@ ob@@ s that every@@ body is tal@@ king about cre@@ ating are those gu@@ ys — the ones that have been in d@@ ec@@ line , over and over ."

"It &apos;s been great tal@@ king to you and get back to work , will you ?"
( Applause )
"M@@ y big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lo@@ c@@ k bil@@ li@@ ons of big ide@@ as that are at the mom@@ ent d@@ or@@ m@@ ant in@@ side us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of ty@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room

"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely for m@@ en , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation has become a vi@@ ri@@ l@@ ity sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l ."
I was rec@@ ently ha@@ ving d@@ in@@ n@@ er with a gu@@ y who bra@@ gg@@ ed that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four h@@ our@@ s s@@ le@@ ep the ni@@ ght before .
"And I f@@ el@@ t like sa@@ ying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I f@@ el@@ t like sa@@ ying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten fi@@ ve , this d@@ in@@ n@@ er would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ shi@@ p ."
"E@@ sp@@ eci@@ ally here in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about ei@@ ght o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ c@@ k ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re li@@ ke@@ ly to tell you , &quot; &quot; Ei@@ ght o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ c@@ k is too l@@ ate for me , but that &apos;s ok@@ ay , I can get a ga@@ me of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ f@@ er@@ ence call@@ s and me@@ et you at ei@@ ght . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly bus@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the tr@@ u@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the mom@@ ent , have had b@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant le@@ ad@@ ers in bus@@ iness , in fin@@ ance , in poli@@ tic@@ s , making ter@@ ri@@ ble deci@@ si@@ ons ."
So a hi@@ gh I.@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good le@@ ad@@ er , because the ess@@ ence of le@@ ad@@ er@@ shi@@ p is being able to see the ic@@ e@@ b@@ er@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."

"Well , as Ch@@ r@@ is po@@ in@@ ted out , I stu@@ dy the human brain , the f@@ un@@ c@@ tions and struc@@ ture of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a min@@ ut@@ e about what this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
"H@@ ere is this ma@@ s@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly , th@@ re@@ e-@@ p@@ ound ma@@ s@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly you can ho@@ ld in the p@@ al@@ m of your h@@ and , and it can con@@ te@@ m@@ pl@@ ate the va@@ st@@ n@@ ess of inter@@ st@@ ell@@ ar space ."
It can con@@ te@@ m@@ pl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can con@@ te@@ m@@ pl@@ ate it@@ self con@@ te@@ m@@ pl@@ ating on the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ si@@ ve qu@@ ality that we call sel@@ f-@@ aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the ho@@ ly gra@@ il of ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , of ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logy , and hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happen@@ s ."
"O@@ K , so how do you stu@@ dy this my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous org@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 10@@ 0 bil@@ lion n@@ er@@ ve c@@ ells , little wi@@ sp@@ s of prot@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this ac@@ tiv@@ ity em@@ er@@ ges the whole spec@@ tr@@ um of ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties that we call human nat@@ ure and human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess ."
How does this happ@@ en ?
"Well , there are many ways of ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ing the f@@ un@@ c@@ tions of the human brain ."
"O@@ n@@ e ap@@ pro@@ ach , the one we use ma@@ in@@ ly , is to look at pa@@ ti@@ ents with su@@ sta@@ in@@ ed da@@ ma@@ ge to a small re@@ gi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gen@@ e@@ tic change in a small re@@ gi@@ on of the brain ."
"Wh@@ at then happen@@ s is not an ac@@ r@@ os@@ s-@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard re@@ duc@@ tion in all your m@@ ent@@ al cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your co@@ g@@ ni@@ tive ab@@ ility ."
"Wh@@ at you get is a high@@ ly sel@@ ec@@ tive l@@ oss of one f@@ un@@ c@@ tion , with other f@@ un@@ c@@ tions being pres@@ er@@ ved int@@ act , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how inv@@ ol@@ ved in medi@@ ating that f@@ un@@ c@@ tion ."
"So you can then ma@@ p f@@ un@@ c@@ tion on@@ to struc@@ ture , and then find out what the c@@ ir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that par@@ tic@@ ular f@@ un@@ c@@ tion ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m gi@@ ving you three ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es , si@@ x min@@ ut@@ es each , d@@ ur@@ ing this talk ."
The first example is an ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome .
"If you look at the first s@@ li@@ de there , that &apos;s the te@@ mp@@ or@@ al lob@@ es , fr@@ on@@ t@@ al lob@@ es , par@@ i@@ et@@ al lob@@ es , O@@ K — the lob@@ es that con@@ sti@@ tu@@ te the brain ."
"And if you look , t@@ uc@@ ked away in@@ side the in@@ n@@ er sur@@ face of the te@@ mp@@ or@@ al lob@@ es — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little struc@@ ture called the f@@ us@@ i@@ form gy@@ r@@ us ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face are@@ a in the brain , because when it &apos;s da@@ ma@@ ged , you can no l@@ on@@ ger re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e them from their vo@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ a@@ h , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e y@@ our@@ self in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you w@@ in@@ k and it w@@ in@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e y@@ our@@ self as y@@ our@@ self ."
O@@ K . Now that sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is well kno@@ wn as ca@@ used by da@@ ma@@ ge to the f@@ us@@ i@@ form gy@@ r@@ us .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few ph@@ ys@@ ici@@ ans have he@@ ard about it , not even ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logi@@ sts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as d@@ el@@ us@@ i@@ on , and that is a pa@@ ti@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se comple@@ tely n@@ or@@ ma@@ l , has had a he@@ ad in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se comple@@ tely n@@ or@@ ma@@ l , he loo@@ ks at his mo@@ ther and sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; This loo@@ ks ex@@ ac@@ tly like my mo@@ ther , this wom@@ an , but she &apos;s an imp@@ os@@ t@@ or ."
"S@@ he &apos;s some other wom@@ an pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mo@@ ther . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happ@@ en ?"
"Wh@@ y would some@@ body — and this person is per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly l@@ uc@@ id and int@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ ent in all other re@@ spec@@ ts , but when he se@@ es his mo@@ ther , his d@@ el@@ us@@ i@@ on k@@ ic@@ ks in and sa@@ ys , it &apos;s not mo@@ ther ."
"Now , the most comm@@ on inter@@ pre@@ ta@@ tion of this , which you find in all the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ry t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an vi@@ e@@ w , and that is that this c@@ ha@@ p — and the same ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent app@@ li@@ es to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about gu@@ ys ."
"When you &apos;re a little b@@ ab@@ y , a y@@ oun@@ g b@@ ab@@ y , you had a str@@ ong se@@ xu@@ al at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tion to your mo@@ ther ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us comple@@ x of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not sa@@ ying I believe this , but this is the st@@ and@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an vi@@ e@@ w ."
"And then , as you gro@@ w up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ xu@@ al ur@@ ges to@@ war@@ ds your mo@@ ther ."
"Th@@ ank G@@ od , or you would all be se@@ xu@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed when you sa@@ w your mo@@ ther ."
"And then what happen@@ s is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your he@@ ad , da@@ ma@@ ging the cor@@ te@@ x , al@@ low@@ ing these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ xu@@ al ur@@ ges to em@@ er@@ ge , fl@@ am@@ ing to the sur@@ face , and su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly and in@@ exp@@ li@@ ca@@ b@@ ly you find y@@ our@@ self being se@@ xu@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mo@@ ther ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; M@@ y G@@ od , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being se@@ xu@@ ally tur@@ ned on ?"
S@@ he &apos;s some other wom@@ an . S@@ he &apos;s an imp@@ os@@ t@@ or . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pre@@ ta@@ tion that ma@@ kes sense to your da@@ ma@@ ged brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent ."
"It &apos;s very in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have se@@ en the same d@@ el@@ us@@ i@@ on , a pa@@ ti@@ ent ha@@ ving the same d@@ el@@ us@@ i@@ on , about his pe@@ t po@@ o@@ d@@ le . ( Laughter )@@ "
"H@@ e &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ t@@ or , this is not Fi@@ f@@ i . It loo@@ ks ex@@ ac@@ tly like Fi@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; Ri@@ ght ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start tal@@ king about the l@@ at@@ ent be@@ sti@@ ality in all hum@@ ans , or some s@@ uch thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to ex@@ pla@@ in this cu@@ ri@@ ous dis@@ or@@ der , we look at the struc@@ ture and f@@ un@@ c@@ tions of the n@@ or@@ ma@@ l vi@@ su@@ al pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , vi@@ su@@ al si@@ gn@@ als come in , into the e@@ ye@@ b@@ all@@ s , go to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 3@@ 0 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vi@@ sion , and after pro@@ c@@ ess@@ ing all that , the m@@ ess@@ age go@@ es to a small struc@@ ture called the f@@ us@@ i@@ form gy@@ r@@ us , where you per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve fac@@ es ."
There are ne@@ ur@@ ons there that are sen@@ si@@ tive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face are@@ a of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that are@@ a &apos;s da@@ ma@@ ged , you l@@ ose the ab@@ ility to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that are@@ a , the m@@ ess@@ age ca@@ s@@ ca@@ des into a struc@@ ture called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a in the li@@ m@@ bi@@ c system , the e@@ mo@@ tional c@@ ore of the brain , and that struc@@ ture , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , g@@ au@@ ges the e@@ mo@@ tional si@@ g@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ dat@@ or ? I@@ s it m@@ ate ?
"O@@ r is it something ab@@ sol@@ u@@ tely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piec@@ e of l@@ int , or a piec@@ e of ch@@ al@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sh@@ o@@ e , or something like that ? O@@ K ?"
Wh@@ ich you can comple@@ tely ig@@ n@@ ore .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is ex@@ c@@ ited , and this is something important , the m@@ ess@@ ag@@ es then ca@@ s@@ ca@@ de into the au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ic n@@ er@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our he@@ art star@@ ts be@@ ating fa@@ ster .
You start s@@ we@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cul@@ ar ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ t@@ un@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ t@@ ro@@ des on your p@@ al@@ m and me@@ as@@ ure the change in sk@@ in re@@ si@@ st@@ ance produc@@ ed by s@@ we@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whe@@ ther you &apos;re ex@@ c@@ ited or whe@@ ther you &apos;re ar@@ ous@@ ed , or not , O@@ K ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a min@@ ut@@ e .
"So my idea was , when this c@@ ha@@ p loo@@ ks at an ob@@ j@@ ect , when he loo@@ ks at his — any ob@@ j@@ ect for that mat@@ ter , it go@@ es to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as and , h@@ ow@@ ever , and it &apos;s pro@@ c@@ ess@@ ed in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form gy@@ r@@ us , and you re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e it as a pe@@ a pl@@ ant , or a t@@ able , or your mo@@ ther , for that mat@@ ter , O@@ K ?"
"And then the m@@ ess@@ age ca@@ s@@ ca@@ des into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , and then go@@ es down the au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ic n@@ er@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this c@@ ha@@ p , that w@@ ir@@ e that go@@ es from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a to the li@@ m@@ bi@@ c system , the e@@ mo@@ tional c@@ ore of the brain , is c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent ."
"So because the f@@ us@@ i@@ form is int@@ act , the c@@ ha@@ p can still re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ e his mo@@ ther , and sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ a@@ h , this loo@@ ks like my mo@@ ther . &quot; &quot; But because the w@@ ir@@ e is c@@ ut to the e@@ mo@@ tional cen@@ ters , he sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mo@@ ther , I don &apos;t experi@@ ence a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the ca@@ se may be ?

"( Laughter ) And ther@@ ef@@ ore , he sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ exp@@ li@@ ca@@ ble l@@ ack of e@@ mo@@ tions ?"
This can &apos;t be my mo@@ ther .
It &apos;s some str@@ an@@ ge wom@@ an pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mo@@ ther . &quot; &quot; How do you t@@ est this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in fr@@ on@@ t of a sc@@ re@@ en , and me@@ as@@ ure your g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in resp@@ on@@ se , and show pic@@ tu@@ res on the sc@@ re@@ en , I can me@@ as@@ ure how you s@@ we@@ at when you see an ob@@ j@@ ect , like a t@@ able or an umb@@ re@@ ll@@ a . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t s@@ we@@ at ."
"If I show you a pic@@ ture of a lion , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start s@@ we@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a pic@@ ture of your mo@@ ther — I &apos;m tal@@ king about n@@ or@@ ma@@ l people — you start s@@ we@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ ew@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happen@@ s if you show this pa@@ ti@@ ent ?"
You take the pa@@ ti@@ ent and show him pic@@ tu@@ res on the sc@@ re@@ en and me@@ as@@ ure his g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in resp@@ on@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ l@@ es and c@@ ha@@ ir@@ s and l@@ int , no@@ thing happen@@ s , as in n@@ or@@ ma@@ l people , but when you show him a pic@@ ture of his mo@@ ther , the g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in resp@@ on@@ se is fl@@ at ."
"There &apos;s no e@@ mo@@ tional re@@ ac@@ tion to his mo@@ ther , because that w@@ ir@@ e going from the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as to the e@@ mo@@ tional cen@@ ters is c@@ ut ."
"So his vi@@ sion is n@@ or@@ ma@@ l because the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as are n@@ or@@ ma@@ l , his e@@ mo@@ tions are n@@ or@@ ma@@ l — he &apos;ll l@@ au@@ gh , he &apos;ll cr@@ y , so on and so for@@ th — but the w@@ ir@@ e from vi@@ sion to e@@ mo@@ tions is c@@ ut and ther@@ ef@@ ore he has this d@@ el@@ us@@ i@@ on that his mo@@ ther is an imp@@ os@@ t@@ or ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ ve@@ ly example of the sort of thing we do : take a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sible , ne@@ ur@@ al p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome and say that the st@@ and@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an vi@@ e@@ w is wr@@ ong , that , in fact , you can come up with a pre@@ ci@@ se ex@@ plan@@ ation in ter@@ ms of the kno@@ wn ne@@ ur@@ al an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pa@@ ti@@ ent then go@@ es , and mo@@ ther ph@@ ones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pic@@ ks up the ph@@ one , and he sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ?

"Th@@ en , she ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mo@@ ther . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"The reas@@ on is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate pa@@ th@@ way going from the he@@ ar@@ ing cen@@ ters in the brain to the e@@ mo@@ tional cen@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent ."
"So this ex@@ pla@@ ins why through the ph@@ one he re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ es his mo@@ ther , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he sa@@ ys it &apos;s an imp@@ os@@ t@@ or ."
"O@@ K , how is all this comple@@ x c@@ ir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry se@@ t up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nat@@ ure , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we ap@@ pro@@ ach this problem by con@@ si@@ der@@ ing another cu@@ ri@@ ous sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called ph@@ an@@ to@@ m li@@ m@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m li@@ m@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is a@@ mp@@ ut@@ ated , or a le@@ g is a@@ mp@@ ut@@ ated , for g@@ an@@ gr@@ en@@ e , or you l@@ ose it in w@@ ar — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q w@@ ar , it &apos;s now a s@@ eri@@ ous problem — you cont@@ in@@ ue to vi@@ vi@@ d@@ ly feel the pres@@ ence of that m@@ is@@ sing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m with al@@ most any part of the body ."
"@@ Be@@ li@@ eve it or not , even with inter@@ n@@ al vi@@ sc@@ er@@ a ."
"I &apos;ve had pa@@ ti@@ ents with the u@@ ter@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ st@@ er@@ ec@@ t@@ om@@ y — who have a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m u@@ ter@@ us , in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding ph@@ an@@ to@@ m m@@ en@@ str@@ u@@ al c@@ ra@@ mp@@ s at the ap@@ pro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."

"O@@ n@@ e of the things we &apos;ve found was , about hal@@ f the pa@@ ti@@ ents with ph@@ an@@ to@@ m li@@ mb@@ s cl@@ ai@@ m that they can mo@@ ve the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ."

"The ph@@ an@@ to@@ m li@@ m@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But do@@ ct@@ or , the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m li@@ m@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a cl@@ en@@ ch@@ ed sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s ex@@ cr@@ uc@@ i@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pa@@ in@@ ful .
"If only I could mo@@ ve it , maybe the pa@@ in will be re@@ li@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m li@@ m@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ?"
It s@@ oun@@ ds like an o@@ xy@@ mor@@ on .

On@@ e of the two as@@ p@@ ects of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ yn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a r@@ un@@ s in fami@@ li@@ es , so G@@ al@@ t@@ on said this is a h@@ er@@ ed@@ it@@ ary bas@@ is , a gen@@ e@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a is about — and this is what ge@@ ts me to my point about the ma@@ in the@@ me of this l@@ ec@@ ture , which is about cre@@ a@@ tiv@@ ity — sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a is ei@@ ght times more comm@@ on am@@ ong ar@@ ti@@ sts , po@@ e@@ ts , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and other cre@@ a@@ tive people than in the gener@@ al p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation ."
Wh@@ y would that be ?
I &apos;m going to an@@ sw@@ er that question .
It &apos;s never been an@@ sw@@ er@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ? What ca@@ us@@ es it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ or@@ ies ."
On@@ e the@@ ory is they &apos;re just c@@ ra@@ z@@ y .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c the@@ ory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther the@@ ory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ k@@ ies and po@@ the@@ a@@ ds , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tr@@ u@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more comm@@ on here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an Di@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ K . Now , the th@@ ir@@ d the@@ ory is that — well , let &apos;s as@@ k our@@ selves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a . A@@ ll right ?"
"So , we found that the col@@ or are@@ a and the number are@@ a are right next to each other in the brain , in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form gy@@ r@@ us ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ al cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing between col@@ or and numb@@ ers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ resp@@ on@@ ding col@@ or , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
Now re@@ memb@@ er — why does this happ@@ en ?
Wh@@ y would there be cr@@ os@@ s@@ ed wi@@ res in some people ?
Re@@ memb@@ er I said it r@@ un@@ s in fami@@ li@@ es ?
That gi@@ ves you the cl@@ ue .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ n@@ or@@ ma@@ l gen@@ e , a mu@@ ta@@ tion in the gen@@ e that ca@@ us@@ es this ab@@ n@@ or@@ ma@@ l cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it tur@@ ns out we are bor@@ n with everything wi@@ red to everything el@@ se ."
"So , every brain re@@ gi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other re@@ gi@@ on , and these are tri@@ mm@@ ed down to create the ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic mo@@ d@@ ular ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the ad@@ ult brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e ca@@ using this tri@@ mm@@ ing and if that gen@@ e m@@ ut@@ ates , then you get de@@ f@@ ici@@ ent tri@@ mm@@ ing between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and col@@ or , you get numb@@ er@@ -@@ col@@ or sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and col@@ or , you get t@@ on@@ e-@@ col@@ or sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"So f@@ ar , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pres@@ s@@ ed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is cr@@ os@@ s-@@ con@@ nec@@ ted ?"
"Well , think about what ar@@ ti@@ sts , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and po@@ e@@ ts have in comm@@ on , the ab@@ ility to en@@ g@@ age in me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ i@@ cal thinking , l@@ in@@ king se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly un@@ re@@ l@@ ated ide@@ as , s@@ uch as , &quot; &quot; It is the e@@ ast , and Ju@@ li@@ et is the Su@@ n . &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , you don &apos;t say , Ju@@ li@@ et is the su@@ n , does that mean she &apos;s a g@@ low@@ ing b@@ all of fir@@ e ?"
"I mean , sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ en@@ ic@@ s do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"N@@ or@@ ma@@ l people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the su@@ n , she &apos;s ra@@ di@@ ant like the su@@ n , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the su@@ n ."
"I@@ n@@ st@@ an@@ tly , you &apos;ve found the l@@ in@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this gre@@ ater cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different par@@ ts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a gre@@ ater pro@@ p@@ en@@ s@@ ity to@@ war@@ ds me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ i@@ cal thinking and cre@@ a@@ tiv@@ ity in people with sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"And , h@@ ence , the ei@@ ght times more comm@@ on in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence of sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a am@@ ong po@@ e@@ ts , ar@@ ti@@ sts and no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ r@@ en@@ o@@ logi@@ cal vi@@ e@@ w of sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
The last de@@ mon@@ st@@ ra@@ tion — can I take one min@@ ut@@ e ?
"( Applause ) O@@ K . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ t@@ es , but you &apos;re in d@@ en@@ i@@ al about it ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s what I call M@@ ar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t . J@@ ust like your al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent sh@@ ap@@ es for different ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , right ?"
"H@@ ere , you &apos;ve got M@@ ar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t ."
"O@@ n@@ e of them is K@@ i@@ k@@ i , one of them is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ."
Wh@@ ich one is K@@ i@@ k@@ i and which one is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ i@@ k@@ i and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ? R@@ ai@@ se your h@@ ands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two m@@ ut@@ an@@ ts ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a , that &apos;s K@@ i@@ k@@ i ? R@@ ai@@ se your h@@ ands ."
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ n@@ ine percent of you .
"Now , n@@ one of you is a M@@ ar@@ ti@@ an . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cr@@ os@@ s-@@ mo@@ de@@ l sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ tic ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tion , me@@ an@@ ing you &apos;re sa@@ ying that that sh@@ ar@@ p in@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion — ki@@ -@@ k@@ i , in your au@@ d@@ it@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x , the ha@@ ir c@@ ells being ex@@ c@@ ited — K@@ i@@ k@@ i , mi@@ m@@ ic@@ s the vi@@ su@@ al in@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion , su@@ dd@@ en in@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of that j@@ ag@@ ged sh@@ ap@@ e ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s t@@ ell@@ ing you is your brain is en@@ g@@ ag@@ ing in a pri@@ mi@@ tive — it &apos;s just — it loo@@ ks like a s@@ il@@ ly ill@@ us@@ i@@ on , but these ph@@ ot@@ ons in your ey@@ e are doing this sh@@ ap@@ e , and ha@@ ir c@@ ells in your e@@ ar are ex@@ c@@ iting the au@@ d@@ it@@ ory p@@ at@@ ter@@ n , but the brain is able to ex@@ tr@@ act the comm@@ on d@@ en@@ om@@ in@@ at@@ or ."
"It &apos;s a pri@@ mi@@ tive form of ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tion , and we now know this happen@@ s in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form gy@@ r@@ us of the brain , because when that &apos;s da@@ ma@@ ged , these people l@@ ose the ab@@ ility to en@@ g@@ age in B@@ ou@@ b@@ a K@@ i@@ k@@ i , but they also l@@ ose the ab@@ ility to en@@ g@@ age in me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"If you as@@ k this gu@@ y , what — &quot; &quot; all that g@@ lit@@ ters is not go@@ ld , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The pa@@ ti@@ ent sa@@ ys , &quot; &quot; W@@ ell , if it &apos;s me@@ tal@@ li@@ c and sh@@ in@@ y , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s go@@ ld ."
"You have to me@@ as@@ ure its sp@@ eci@@ fi@@ c gra@@ v@@ ity , O@@ K ? &quot; &quot; So , they comple@@ tely m@@ is@@ s the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ i@@ cal me@@ an@@ ing ."
"So , this are@@ a is about ei@@ ght times the si@@ ze in high@@ er — es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally in hum@@ ans — as in low@@ er pri@@ mat@@ es ."
"S@@ om@@ e@@ thing very interesting is going on here in the an@@ g@@ ular gy@@ r@@ us , because it &apos;s the cr@@ os@@ s@@ ro@@ a@@ ds between he@@ ar@@ ing , vi@@ sion and t@@ ou@@ ch , and it be@@ came en@@ or@@ m@@ ous in hum@@ ans . And something very interesting is going on ."
"And I think it &apos;s a bas@@ is of many uni@@ qu@@ ely human ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties like ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tion , me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or and cre@@ a@@ tiv@@ ity ."
"A@@ ll of these ques@@ tions that ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ers have been stu@@ d@@ ying for mil@@ l@@ en@@ ni@@ a , we sci@@ enti@@ sts can be@@ g@@ in to ex@@ pl@@ ore by doing brain ima@@ ging , and by stu@@ d@@ ying pa@@ ti@@ ents and as@@ king the right ques@@ tions ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) S@@ or@@ ry about that .

This story is about ta@@ king ima@@ gin@@ ation s@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly .
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I first en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed this or@@ d@@ in@@ ary mat@@ eri@@ al , fi@@ sh@@ ne@@ t , used the same way for cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m using it to create per@@ man@@ ent , bil@@ low@@ ing , v@@ ol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous for@@ ms the sc@@ ale of h@@ ar@@ d-@@ ed@@ ged buil@@ d@@ ings in ci@@ ties around the world ."
I was an un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly person to be doing this .
"I never stu@@ di@@ ed sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture , en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing or ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture ."
"In fact , after col@@ le@@ ge I app@@ li@@ ed to se@@ ven art sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s and was re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted by all se@@ ven ."
"I went off on my own to become an ar@@ ti@@ st , and I pa@@ in@@ ted for 10 years , when I was off@@ er@@ ed a F@@ ul@@ b@@ right to In@@ di@@ a ."
"P@@ r@@ om@@ is@@ ing to give ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions of pa@@ int@@ ings , I shi@@ pp@@ ed my pa@@ in@@ ts and ar@@ ri@@ ved in Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ ali@@ p@@ ur@@ am ."
The de@@ ad@@ line for the show ar@@ ri@@ ved — my pa@@ in@@ ts didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fi@@ sh@@ ing v@@ ill@@ age was fam@@ ous for sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture .
So I tri@@ ed br@@ on@@ ze ca@@ st@@ ing .
But to make lar@@ ge for@@ ms was too he@@ av@@ y and exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve .
"I went for a wal@@ k on the be@@ ach , w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ m@@ en b@@ und@@ le their ne@@ ts into m@@ oun@@ ds on the s@@ and ."
"I &apos;d se@@ en it every day , but this time I sa@@ w it differ@@ ently — a new ap@@ pro@@ ach to sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture , a way to make v@@ ol@@ u@@ me@@ tri@@ c form with@@ out he@@ av@@ y so@@ li@@ d mat@@ eri@@ als ."
M@@ y first sa@@ ti@@ s@@ f@@ ying sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture was made in coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation with these fi@@ sh@@ er@@ m@@ en .
It &apos;s a sel@@ f-@@ p@@ ort@@ ra@@ it ti@@ tl@@ ed &quot; &quot; Wi@@ de Hi@@ ps . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We ho@@ i@@ st@@ ed them on p@@ ol@@ es to ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h .
I disc@@ over@@ ed their so@@ ft sur@@ fac@@ es re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed every ri@@ pp@@ le of w@@ ind in con@@ st@@ an@@ tly chan@@ ging p@@ at@@ ter@@ ns .
I was m@@ es@@ m@@ er@@ iz@@ ed .
"I cont@@ in@@ u@@ ed stu@@ d@@ ying c@@ ra@@ ft tra@@ di@@ tions and coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ating with ar@@ ti@@ s@@ ans , next in Li@@ th@@ u@@ an@@ i@@ a with l@@ ace ma@@ k@@ ers ."
"I li@@ ked the f@@ ine de@@ ta@@ il it ga@@ ve my work , but I wanted to make them lar@@ ger — to shi@@ ft from being an ob@@ j@@ ect you look at to something you could get l@@ ost in ."
"@@ Re@@ tur@@ ning to In@@ di@@ a to work with those fi@@ sh@@ er@@ m@@ en , we made a ne@@ t of a million and a hal@@ f h@@ and@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots — in@@ st@@ all@@ ed b@@ ri@@ ef@@ ly in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d ."
"Th@@ ous@@ ands of people sa@@ w it , and one of them was the ur@@ b@@ an@@ ist M@@ an@@ u@@ al S@@ ol@@ a@@ -@@ M@@ or@@ al@@ es who was re@@ desig@@ ning the w@@ at@@ er@@ fr@@ on@@ t in P@@ or@@ to , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al ."
He as@@ ked if I could buil@@ d this as a per@@ man@@ ent piec@@ e for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and pres@@ er@@ ve my art .
"D@@ ur@@ able , en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ed , per@@ man@@ ent — those are in op@@ pos@@ i@@ tion to i@@ di@@ os@@ yn@@ c@@ ra@@ tic , de@@ li@@ ca@@ te and ep@@ he@@ m@@ er@@ al ."
"F@@ or two years , I sear@@ ch@@ ed for a fi@@ b@@ er that could sur@@ vi@@ ve ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ra@@ ys , s@@ al@@ t , a@@ ir , p@@ oll@@ ution , and at the same time re@@ ma@@ in so@@ ft enough to mo@@ ve fl@@ u@@ id@@ ly in the w@@ ind ."
We nee@@ ded something to ho@@ ld the ne@@ t up out there in the mi@@ dd@@ le of the tra@@ ff@@ ic c@@ ir@@ c@@ le .
"So we ra@@ is@@ ed this 45@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ ound ste@@ el r@@ ing ."
We had to en@@ gin@@ e@@ er it to mo@@ ve gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly in an a@@ ver@@ age bre@@ e@@ ze and sur@@ vi@@ ve in h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e w@@ in@@ ds .
But there was no en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to mo@@ de@@ l something p@@ or@@ ous and mo@@ ving .
I found a b@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical en@@ gin@@ e@@ er who desig@@ ns sa@@ il@@ s for Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a &apos;s C@@ up r@@ ac@@ ing y@@ ach@@ ts n@@ am@@ ed Pe@@ ter H@@ ep@@ pe@@ l .
He hel@@ p@@ ed me t@@ ac@@ k@@ le the tw@@ in ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges of pre@@ ci@@ se sh@@ ap@@ e and g@@ ent@@ le mo@@ v@@ ement .
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t buil@@ d this the way I k@@ new because h@@ and@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots w@@ er@@ en &apos;t going to with@@ st@@ and a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e .
"So I develop@@ ed a re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p with an in@@ du@@ stri@@ al fi@@ sh@@ ne@@ t fac@@ t@@ ory , lear@@ ned the v@@ ari@@ ab@@ l@@ es of their m@@ ach@@ in@@ es , and fi@@ gu@@ red out a way to make l@@ ace with them ."
"There was no l@@ an@@ gu@@ age to tran@@ sl@@ ate this an@@ ci@@ ent , i@@ di@@ os@@ yn@@ c@@ ra@@ tic h@@ and@@ c@@ ra@@ ft into something m@@ ach@@ ine op@@ er@@ at@@ ors could pro@@ du@@ ce ."
So we had to create one .
"Th@@ ree years and two children l@@ ater , we ra@@ is@@ ed this 50@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ s@@ qu@@ ar@@ e-@@ f@@ oo@@ t l@@ ace ne@@ t ."
"It was hard to believe that what I had ima@@ gin@@ ed was now buil@@ t , per@@ man@@ ent and had l@@ ost no@@ thing in tran@@ sl@@ ation ."
( Applause ) This inter@@ sec@@ tion had been bl@@ and and an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I wal@@ ked under@@ ne@@ ath it for the first time .
"A@@ s I w@@ at@@ ch@@ ed the w@@ ind &apos;s cho@@ re@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y un@@ fo@@ ld , I f@@ el@@ t sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed and , at the same time , con@@ nec@@ ted to li@@ m@@ it@@ less sk@@ y ."
M@@ y life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these o@@ as@@ es of sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture in sp@@ ac@@ es of ci@@ ties around the world .
I &apos;m going to sh@@ are two di@@ rec@@ tions that are new in my work .
"H@@ i@@ stor@@ ic Ph@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ p@@ hi@@ a C@@ ity H@@ all : its pla@@ z@@ a , I f@@ el@@ t , nee@@ ded a mat@@ eri@@ al for sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture that was li@@ gh@@ ter than ne@@ tting ."
"So we exper@@ im@@ en@@ ted with t@@ in@@ y at@@ om@@ iz@@ ed water par@@ ti@@ cl@@ es to create a dr@@ y m@@ ist that is sh@@ ap@@ ed by the w@@ ind and in te@@ st@@ ing , disc@@ over@@ ed that it can be sh@@ ap@@ ed by people who can inter@@ act and mo@@ ve through it with@@ out getting w@@ et ."
I &apos;m using this sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture mat@@ eri@@ al to tr@@ ace the pa@@ ths of su@@ b@@ way tra@@ ins ab@@ o@@ ve gr@@ ound in real time — like an X-@@ r@@ ay of the city &apos;s c@@ ir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory system un@@ f@@ ol@@ ding .

"( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to be@@ g@@ in , but I said y@@ es ."

"So I cont@@ ac@@ ted N@@ O@@ A@@ A , and I as@@ ked if they &apos;d sh@@ are their data on the t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i , and tran@@ sl@@ ated it into this ."
I@@ ts ti@@ tle : &quot; &quot; 1.@@ 2@@ 6 &quot; &quot; re@@ f@@ ers to the number of m@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ econ@@ ds that the E@@ ar@@ th &apos;s day was sh@@ ort@@ en@@ ed .

There was no so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that could ex@@ tr@@ u@@ de these comple@@ x ne@@ t for@@ ms and mo@@ de@@ l them with gra@@ v@@ ity .
