"A@@ mon@@ g@@ st all the t@@ rou@@ b@@ ling de@@ fi@@ ci@@ ts we stru@@ gg@@ le with today — we think of fin@@ an@@ cial and economic pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly — the ones that con@@ cer@@ n me most is the de@@ fi@@ c@@ it of poli@@ tical di@@ al@@ og@@ ue — our ability to ad@@ dre@@ ss moder@@ n con@@ fli@@ cts as they are , to go to the source of what they &apos;re all about and to understand the key pla@@ y@@ ers and to deal with them ."
"We who are di@@ pl@@ om@@ ats , we are tra@@ ined to deal with con@@ fli@@ cts between st@@ ates and issu@@ es between st@@ ates ."
"And I can tell you , our ag@@ en@@ da is full ."
"There is tra@@ de , there is dis@@ ar@@ m@@ am@@ ent , there is cro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ bor@@ der rel@@ ations ."
"But the picture is chang@@ ing , and we are seeing that there are new key pla@@ y@@ ers coming on@@ to the scen@@ e ."
"We loo@@ se@@ ly call them &quot; &quot; grou@@ ps . &quot; &quot; They may re@@ present social , religi@@ ous , poli@@ tical , economic , mi@@ lit@@ ary reali@@ ties ."
And we stru@@ gg@@ le with how to deal with them .
"The ru@@ les of eng@@ ag@@ ement : how to talk , when to talk , and how to deal with them ."
Let me show you a sli@@ de here which il@@ lu@@ str@@ ates the char@@ ac@@ ter of con@@ fli@@ cts since 19@@ 4@@ 6 until today .
"You see the green is a tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal inter@@ state con@@ fli@@ ct , the ones we used to read about ."
"The red is moder@@ n con@@ fli@@ ct , con@@ fli@@ cts within st@@ ates ."
"These are quite different , and they are outside the gra@@ s@@ p of moder@@ n di@@ pl@@ om@@ acy ."
And the cor@@ e of these key ac@@ t@@ ors are grou@@ ps who re@@ present different interest@@ s inside countries .
And the way they deal with their con@@ fli@@ cts ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly sp@@ re@@ ads to other countries .
"So in a way , it is everybody &apos;s business ."
"A@@ no@@ ther ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ment we &apos;ve seen during these years , re@@ cent years , is that very few of these dom@@ esti@@ c inter@@ state , in@@ tra@@ state con@@ fli@@ cts can be sol@@ ved mi@@ lit@@ ari@@ ly ."
"They may have to be de@@ al@@ t with with mi@@ lit@@ ary means , but they cannot be sol@@ ved by mi@@ lit@@ ary means ."
They need poli@@ tical solu@@ tions .
"And we , ther@@ e@@ fore , have a problem , because they es@@ cape tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal di@@ pl@@ om@@ acy ."
And we have am@@ ong st@@ ates a re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ance in de@@ al@@ ing with them .
"P@@ lu@@ s , during the last dec@@ ade , we &apos;ve been in the mo@@ de where de@@ al@@ ing with grou@@ ps was con@@ cep@@ tually and poli@@ ti@@ cally d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ."
"A@@ f@@ ter 9 / 11 , either you were with us or against us ."
It was black or white .
And grou@@ ps are very often im@@ medi@@ ately la@@ be@@ l ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sts .
And who would talk to ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sts ?
"The W@@ est , as I would see it , comes out of that dec@@ ade we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed , because we didn &apos;t understand the group ."
So we &apos;ve spent more time on fo@@ c@@ using on why we should not talk to others than fin@@ ding out how we talk to others .
Now I &apos;m not na@@ i@@ ve .
You cannot talk to everybody all the time .
And there are times you should walk .
And sometimes mi@@ lit@@ ary inter@@ ven@@ tion is ne@@ cess@@ ary .
I happen to believe that Li@@ by@@ a was ne@@ cess@@ ary and that mi@@ lit@@ ary inter@@ ven@@ tion in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan was also ne@@ cess@@ ary .
"And my country rel@@ ies on its secu@@ ri@@ ty through mi@@ lit@@ ary al@@ li@@ ance , that &apos;s clear ."
But still we have a large de@@ fi@@ c@@ it in de@@ al@@ ing with and under@@ standing moder@@ n con@@ fli@@ ct .
Let us turn to Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan .
"@@ 10 years after that mi@@ lit@@ ary inter@@ ven@@ tion , that country is far from secu@@ re ."
"The situ@@ ation , to be hon@@ est , is very seri@@ ous ."
"Now again , the mi@@ lit@@ ary is ne@@ cess@@ ary , but the mi@@ lit@@ ary is no proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ver ."
"When I first came to Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan in 200@@ 5 as a fore@@ ig@@ n min@@ ist@@ er , I met the com@@ man@@ der of I@@ S@@ A@@ F , the inter@@ national tro@@ op@@ s ."
"And he told me that , &quot; &quot; This can be won mi@@ lit@@ ari@@ ly , min@@ ist@@ er ."
"We just have to per@@ se@@ v@@ ere . &quot; &quot; Now four C@@ O@@ M I@@ S@@ A@@ F &apos;s later , we hear a different mess@@ age : &quot; &quot; This cannot be won mi@@ lit@@ ari@@ ly ."
"We need mi@@ lit@@ ary pre@@ sen@@ ce , but we need to move to poli@@ ti@@ cs ."
We can only sol@@ ve this through a poli@@ tical solution .
"And it is not us who will sol@@ ve it ; Af@@ gh@@ ans have to sol@@ ve it . &quot; &quot; But then they need a different poli@@ tical process than the one they were given in 200@@ 1 , 200@@ 2 ."
They need an inclu@@ sive process where the real f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of this very comp@@ lic@@ ated society can deal with their issu@@ es .
E@@ very@@ body seem@@ s to ag@@ ree with that .
"It was very contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al to say three , four , five years ago ."
Now everybody ag@@ re@@ es .
"But now , as we pre@@ p@@ are to talk , we understand how little we know ."
Because we didn &apos;t talk .
We didn &apos;t gra@@ s@@ p what was going on .
"The Inter@@ national C@@ om@@ mi@@ t@@ te@@ e of the R@@ ed C@@ ross , the I@@ C@@ R@@ C , is talking to everyone , and it is doing so because it is neu@@ tra@@ l ."
And that &apos;s one reason why that organiz@@ ation probably is the best inform@@ ed key pla@@ y@@ er to understand moder@@ n con@@ fli@@ ct — because they talk .
My point is that you don &apos;t have to be neu@@ tra@@ l to talk .
And you don &apos;t have to ag@@ ree when you si@@ t down with the other side .
And you can always walk .
"But if you don &apos;t talk , you can &apos;t eng@@ age the other side ."
And the other side which you &apos;re going to eng@@ age is the one with wh@@ om you prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly dis@@ ag@@ ree .
"P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er R@@ ab@@ in said when he eng@@ aged the O@@ sl@@ o process , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t make pe@@ ace with your friends , you make pe@@ ace with your ene@@ mie@@ s . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s hard , but it is ne@@ cess@@ ary ."
Let me go one ste@@ p f@@ ur@@ ther .
This is T@@ a@@ h@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are .
There &apos;s a re@@ v@@ olution going on .
The A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing is he@@ ading into f@@ all and is moving into win@@ ter .
"It will last for a long , long time ."
And who know@@ s what it will be called in the end .
That &apos;s not the point .
"The point is that we are probably seeing , for the first time in the history of the A@@ ra@@ b world , a re@@ v@@ olution bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up — people &apos;s re@@ v@@ olution ."
S@@ o@@ cial grou@@ ps are taking to the stre@@ ets .
And we find out in the W@@ est that we know very little about what &apos;s happening .
Because we never talk to the people in these countries .
"Mo@@ st govern@@ ments fol@@ low@@ ed the di@@ ct@@ ate of the au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an le@@ ad@@ ers to st@@ ay away from these different grou@@ ps , because they were ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sts ."
"So now that they are em@@ er@@ g@@ ing in the stre@@ et and we s@@ al@@ u@@ te the de@@ moc@@ r@@ atic re@@ v@@ olution , we find out how little we know ."
"R@@ ight now , the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion goes , &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ould we talk to the M@@ us@@ li@@ m B@@ ro@@ ther@@ ho@@ od ?"
S@@ h@@ ould we talk to H@@ am@@ as ?
"If we talk to them , we may le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mi@@ ze them . &quot; &quot; I think that is wrong ."
"If you talk in the right way , you make it very clear that talking is not ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing ."
"And how can we tell the M@@ us@@ li@@ m B@@ ro@@ ther@@ ho@@ od , as we should , that they must re@@ spe@@ ct min@@ ori@@ ty ri@@ ghts , if we don &apos;t ac@@ cept maj@@ ori@@ ty ri@@ ghts ?"
Because they may turn out to be a maj@@ ori@@ ty .
"H@@ ow can we es@@ cape &#91; having &#93; a d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ stan@@ d@@ ard , if we at the same time pre@@ ach de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y and at the same time don &apos;t want to deal with the grou@@ ps that are re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative ?"
How will we ever be inter@@ lo@@ cu@@ t@@ ors ?
Now my di@@ pl@@ om@@ ats are instru@@ cted to talk to all these grou@@ ps .
But talking can be done in different ways .
We make a di@@ st@@ in@@ ction between talking from a di@@ pl@@ om@@ atic level and talking at the poli@@ tical level .
Now talking can be ac@@ comp@@ an@@ ied with a@@ id or not with a@@ id .
T@@ al@@ king can be ac@@ comp@@ an@@ ied with inclu@@ sion or not inclu@@ sion .
There &apos;s a big ar@@ ra@@ y of the ways of de@@ al@@ ing with this .
"So if we ref@@ use to talk to these new grou@@ ps that are going to be dom@@ in@@ ating the news in years to come , we will f@@ ur@@ ther radi@@ c@@ aliz@@ ation , I believe ."
We will make the ro@@ ad from viol@@ ent acti@@ vi@@ ties into poli@@ ti@@ cs har@@ der to tra@@ vel .
"And if we cannot de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate to these grou@@ ps that if you move towar@@ ds de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y , if you move towar@@ ds taking part in ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ed and nor@@ mal stan@@ dar@@ ds am@@ ong st@@ ates , there are some re@@ war@@ ds on the other side ."
The par@@ ad@@ o@@ x here is that the last dec@@ ade probably was a lost dec@@ ade for making pro@@ gre@@ ss on this .
And the par@@ ad@@ o@@ x is that the dec@@ ade before the last dec@@ ade was so pro@@ mis@@ ing — and for one reason pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly .
And the reason is what happened in S@@ outh Africa : N@@ el@@ son M@@ an@@ de@@ la .
"When M@@ an@@ de@@ la came out of pri@@ son after 2@@ 7 years of cap@@ ti@@ vity , if he had told his people , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s time to take up the ar@@ ms , it &apos;s time to fi@@ ght , &quot; &quot; he would have been fol@@ low@@ ed ."
"And I think the inter@@ national community would have said , &quot; &quot; F@@ air enough ."
"It &apos;s their right to fi@@ ght . &quot; &quot; Now as you know , M@@ an@@ de@@ la didn &apos;t do that ."
"In his me@@ mo@@ ir@@ s , &quot; &quot; L@@ ong Ro@@ ad to F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , &quot; &quot; he wro@@ te that he survi@@ ved during those years of cap@@ ti@@ vity because he always decided to look upo@@ n his op@@ pres@@ s@@ or as also being a human being , also being a human being ."
"So he eng@@ aged a poli@@ tical process of di@@ al@@ og@@ ue , not as a strate@@ gy of the we@@ ak , but as a strate@@ gy of the stron@@ g ."
And he eng@@ aged talking prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly by se@@ t@@ t@@ ling some of the most tri@@ ck@@ y issu@@ es through a tru@@ th and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation process where people came and tal@@ ked .
Now S@@ outh Afri@@ can friends will know that was very pain@@ ful .
So what can we learn from all of this ?
"D@@ i@@ al@@ og@@ ue is not e@@ asy — not between individu@@ als , not between grou@@ ps , not between govern@@ ments — but it is very ne@@ cess@@ ary ."
"If we &apos;re going to deal with poli@@ tical con@@ fli@@ ct@@ -@@ sol@@ ving of con@@ fli@@ cts , if we &apos;re going to understand these new grou@@ ps which are coming from bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up , sup@@ por@@ ted by technology , which is available to all , we di@@ pl@@ om@@ ats cannot be sitting back in the ban@@ qu@@ ets belie@@ ving that we are doing inter@@ state rel@@ ations ."
We have to conne@@ ct with these pro@@ found chang@@ es .
And what is di@@ al@@ og@@ ue really about ?
"When I enter into di@@ al@@ og@@ ue , I really hope that the other side would pi@@ ck up my poin@@ ts of view , that I would im@@ pre@@ ss upo@@ n them my op@@ ini@@ ons and my val@@ u@@ es ."
I cannot do that un@@ less I sen@@ d the sig@@ n@@ als that I will be open to list@@ en to the other side &apos;s sig@@ n@@ als .
We need a lot more tra@@ ining on how to do that and a lot more prac@@ ti@@ ce on how that can take proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ving forward .
"We know from our per@@ s@@ onal exper@@ ien@@ ces that it &apos;s e@@ asy sometimes just to walk , and sometimes you may need to fi@@ ght ."
And I wouldn &apos;t say that is the wrong thing in all cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces .
S@@ ome@@ times you have to .
But that strate@@ gy sel@@ dom takes you very far .
The alter@@ n@@ ative is a strate@@ gy of eng@@ ag@@ ement and prin@@ ci@@ p@@ led di@@ al@@ og@@ ue .
"And I believe we need to str@@ eng@@ then this appro@@ ach in moder@@ n di@@ pl@@ om@@ acy , not only between st@@ ates , but also within st@@ ates ."
We are seeing some new sig@@ ns .
"We could never have done the con@@ ven@@ tion against anti@@ -@@ per@@ son@@ ne@@ l land@@ min@@ es and the con@@ ven@@ tion that is ban@@ ning clu@@ ster muni@@ tions un@@ less we had done di@@ pl@@ om@@ acy differ@@ ently , by eng@@ ag@@ ing with ci@@ vi@@ l society ."
"A@@ ll of a sud@@ den , N@@ G@@ O@@ s were not only standing in the stre@@ ets , c@@ ry@@ ing their s@@ log@@ ans , but they were taking &#91; them &#93; into the neg@@ oti@@ ations , par@@ tly because they re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted the vi@@ cti@@ ms of these we@@ apo@@ ns ."
And they brought their know@@ le@@ dge .
And there was an inter@@ action between di@@ pl@@ om@@ acy and the power coming bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up .
This is per@@ haps a first ele@@ ment of a change .
"In the future , I believe , we should dra@@ w exam@@ ples from these different il@@ lu@@ str@@ ations , not to have di@@ pl@@ om@@ acy which is dis@@ conne@@ cted from people and ci@@ vi@@ l society ."
"And we have to go also be@@ y@@ ond tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal di@@ pl@@ om@@ acy to the survi@@ v@@ al issue of our times , clim@@ ate change ."
"H@@ ow are we going to sol@@ ve clim@@ ate change through neg@@ oti@@ ations , un@@ less we are able to make ci@@ vi@@ l society and people , not part of the problem , but part of the solution ?"
"It is going to de@@ m@@ and an inclu@@ sive process of di@@ pl@@ om@@ acy very different from the one we are prac@@ ti@@ cing today as we are he@@ ading to new ro@@ un@@ ds of difficult clim@@ ate neg@@ oti@@ ations , but when we move tow@@ ard something which has to be much more along a bro@@ ad mo@@ bi@@ liz@@ ation ."
"It &apos;s c@@ ru@@ cial to understand , I believe , because of technology and because of glob@@ aliz@@ ation , socie@@ ties from bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up ."
We as di@@ pl@@ om@@ ats need to know the social ca@@ pi@@ tal of communi@@ ties .
"What is it that makes people tr@@ ust each other , not only between st@@ ates , but also within st@@ ates ?"
"What is the le@@ gi@@ ti@@ m@@ acy of di@@ pl@@ om@@ acy , of the the solution we de@@ vi@@ se as di@@ pl@@ om@@ ats if they cannot be ref@@ le@@ cted and under@@ sto@@ od by also these bro@@ a@@ der for@@ ces of socie@@ ties that we now very loo@@ se@@ ly call grou@@ ps ?"
The good thing is that we are not power@@ less .
"We have never had as many means of communi@@ cation , means of being conne@@ cted , means of re@@ ach@@ ing out , means of inclu@@ ding ."
The di@@ pl@@ om@@ atic to@@ ol@@ box is actually full of different to@@ ols we can use to str@@ eng@@ then our communi@@ cation .
But the problem is that we are coming out of a dec@@ ade where we had a fe@@ ar of tou@@ ching it .
"Now , I hope , in the coming years , that we are able to de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate through some con@@ cre@@ te exam@@ ples that fe@@ ar is re@@ ce@@ ding and that we can take cou@@ ra@@ ge from that al@@ li@@ ance with ci@@ vi@@ l society in different countries to sup@@ port their proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ving , am@@ ong the Af@@ gh@@ ans , inside the P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ an popul@@ ation , between the pe@@ op@@ les of P@@ al@@ est@@ ine and Is@@ ra@@ el ."
"And as we try to understand this bro@@ ad movement across the A@@ ra@@ b world , we are not power@@ less ."
"We need to impro@@ ve the ne@@ cess@@ ary sk@@ il@@ ls , and we need the cou@@ ra@@ ge to use them ."
"In my country , I have seen how the coun@@ ci@@ l of Is@@ l@@ ami@@ st grou@@ ps and Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an grou@@ ps came together , not as a government ini@@ ti@@ ative , but they came together on their own ini@@ ti@@ ative to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh cont@@ act and di@@ al@@ og@@ ue in times where things were pretty low@@ -@@ key ten@@ sion ."
"And when ten@@ sion incre@@ as@@ ed , they already had that di@@ al@@ og@@ ue , and that was a str@@ eng@@ th to deal with different issu@@ es ."
"O@@ ur moder@@ n W@@ est@@ er@@ n socie@@ ties are more comple@@ x than before , in this time of mi@@ gr@@ ation ."
How are we going to se@@ t@@ tle and build a bi@@ g@@ ger &quot; &quot; We &quot; &quot; to deal with our issu@@ es if we don &apos;t impro@@ ve our sk@@ il@@ ls of communi@@ cation ?
"So there are many reas@@ ons , and for all of these reas@@ ons , this is time and this is why we must talk ."
Thank you for your at@@ ten@@ tion .

"Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out my car@@ e@@ er , I &apos;ve been for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate enough to work with many of the great inter@@ national archite@@ cts , do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ing their work and obser@@ ving how their desig@@ ns have the ca@@ pac@@ ity to in@@ flu@@ ence the cities in which they si@@ t ."
"I think of new cities like D@@ u@@ ba@@ i or an@@ cient cities like R@@ ome with Za@@ h@@ a H@@ ad@@ id &apos;s incredible M@@ A@@ X@@ X@@ I mus@@ e@@ um , or like right here in New York with the Hi@@ gh L@@ ine , a city which has been so much in@@ flu@@ en@@ ced by the develo@@ pment of this ."
"But what I find really fas@@ cin@@ ating is what happens when archite@@ cts and plan@@ n@@ ers leave and these places become appro@@ pri@@ ated by people , like here in Ch@@ an@@ di@@ gar@@ h , Indi@@ a , the city which has been completely desig@@ ned by the archite@@ ct L@@ e C@@ or@@ bus@@ ier ."
"Now 60 years later , the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever per@@ haps inten@@ ded for , like here , where you have the people sitting in the win@@ dow@@ s of the as@@ se@@ m@@ bly h@@ all ."
"But over the course of se@@ ver@@ al years , I &apos;ve been do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ing R@@ em Ko@@ ol@@ ha@@ as &apos;s C@@ C@@ T@@ V building in Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing and the ol@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ c st@@ ad@@ i@@ um in the same city by the archite@@ cts H@@ er@@ z@@ o@@ g and de Me@@ u@@ ro@@ n ."
"A@@ t these lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale con@@ stru@@ ction si@@ tes in China , you see a sort of mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft cam@@ p where wor@@ k@@ ers live during the entire building process ."
"As the len@@ g@@ th of the con@@ stru@@ ction takes years , wor@@ k@@ ers end up form@@ ing a rather rou@@ gh@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ ready inform@@ al city , making for quite a ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posi@@ tion against the s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated stru@@ ctures that they &apos;re building ."
"O@@ ver the past seven years , I &apos;ve been fol@@ low@@ ing my fas@@ cin@@ ation with the built environment , and for those of you who know me , you would say that this ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion has led me to live out of a su@@ it@@ case 3@@ 6@@ 5 days a year ."
"Be@@ ing con@@ stan@@ tly on the move means that sometimes I am able to cat@@ ch life &apos;s most un@@ pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able mom@@ ents , like here in New York the day after the S@@ an@@ dy stor@@ m h@@ it the city ."
"J@@ ust over three years ago , I was for the first time in C@@ ar@@ ac@@ as , V@@ ene@@ zu@@ el@@ a , and while fl@@ ying over the city , I was just amaz@@ ed by the ex@@ t@@ ent to which the s@@ lu@@ ms re@@ ach into every cor@@ ner of the city , a place where ne@@ ar@@ ly 70 percent of the popul@@ ation lives in s@@ lu@@ ms , dra@@ ped liter@@ ally all over the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing a convers@@ ation with local archite@@ cts U@@ r@@ ban@@ -@@ Th@@ in@@ k T@@ ank , I learned about the T@@ or@@ re Davi@@ d , a 4@@ 5@@ -@@ story offi@@ ce building which si@@ ts right in the cen@@ ter of C@@ ar@@ ac@@ as ."
The building was under con@@ stru@@ ction until the col@@ lap@@ se of the V@@ ene@@ zu@@ el@@ an econom@@ y and the death of the develo@@ per in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s .
"A@@ b@@ out eight years ago , people started moving into the ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed tow@@ er and began to build their hom@@ es right in between every col@@ um@@ n of this un@@ fini@@ shed tow@@ er ."
"There &apos;s only one little en@@ tr@@ ance to the entire building , and the 3@@ ,000 resi@@ d@@ ents come in and out through that single door ."
"T@@ og@@ e@@ ther , the in@@ ha@@ bi@@ tan@@ ts created public sp@@ ac@@ es and desig@@ ned them to feel more like a home and less like an un@@ fini@@ shed tow@@ er ."
"In the lob@@ by , they pain@@ ted the wal@@ ls and plan@@ ted tre@@ es ."
They also made a bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball cour@@ t .
"But when you look up clo@@ se@@ ly , you see mas@@ sive ho@@ les where ele@@ v@@ at@@ ors and ser@@ vi@@ ces would have run through ."
"Wi@@ th@@ in the tow@@ er , people have come up with all sor@@ ts of solu@@ tions in respon@@ se to the v@@ ari@@ ous needs which ari@@ se from living in an un@@ fini@@ shed tow@@ er ."
"Wi@@ th no ele@@ v@@ at@@ ors , the tow@@ er is like a 4@@ 5@@ -@@ story wal@@ k@@ up ."
De@@ sig@@ ned in very speci@@ fic ways by this group of people who ha@@ ven &apos;t had any education in archite@@ cture or design .
"And with each in@@ ha@@ bi@@ t@@ ant fin@@ ding their own uni@@ qu@@ e way of coming by , this tow@@ er be@@ comes like a living city , a place which is ali@@ ve with micro@@ -@@ econom@@ ies and small bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es ."

"There is even a ph@@ oto studi@@ o where you see the sort of as@@ pi@@ r@@ ation to live in a real house or to be as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with a far@@ away place , like that hot@@ el in S@@ we@@ den ."
"O@@ n this particular ev@@ ening , I came across this live b@@ and dre@@ s@@ sed to the T in their co@@ ordin@@ ating out@@ fi@@ ts ."
They were flo@@ ating through the can@@ als in a large can@@ o@@ e with a fi@@ t@@ te@@ d-@@ out gener@@ ator for all of the community to en@@ jo@@ y .
"B@@ y ni@@ gh@@ t@@ f@@ all , the area be@@ comes almost pit@@ ch black , sa@@ ve for a small li@@ gh@@ t@@ bu@@ l@@ b or a fi@@ re ."
"What ori@@ gin@@ ally brought me to M@@ ak@@ o@@ ko was this project from a friend of m@@ ine , K@@ un@@ l@@ é A@@ de@@ ye@@ mi , who re@@ cent@@ ly fini@@ shed building this thre@@ e-@@ story flo@@ ating school for the kids in M@@ ak@@ o@@ ko ."
"Wi@@ th this entire vi@@ ll@@ age ex@@ ist@@ ing on the water , public space is very li@@ mi@@ ted , so now that the school is fini@@ shed , the ground flo@@ or is a pla@@ y@@ ground for the kids , but when clas@@ ses are out , the pl@@ at@@ form is just like a tow@@ n squ@@ are , where the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men m@@ end their ne@@ ts and flo@@ ating sh@@ op@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s do@@ ck their bo@@ ats ."
A@@ no@@ ther place I &apos;d like to share with you is the Z@@ ab@@ b@@ ale@@ en in C@@ air@@ o .
"They &apos;re des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of farm@@ ers who began mi@@ gr@@ ating from the u@@ pp@@ er E@@ g@@ y@@ pt in the &apos; 4@@ 0s , and today they make their living by colle@@ cting and re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling wa@@ ste from hom@@ es from all over C@@ air@@ o ."
"For years , the Z@@ ab@@ b@@ ale@@ en would live in mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft vi@@ ll@@ ages where they would move around trying to av@@ o@@ id the local au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ies , but in the early 19@@ 8@@ 0s , they se@@ t@@ t@@ led on the Mo@@ kat@@ tam ro@@ cks just at the e@@ ast@@ er@@ n ed@@ ge of the city ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , they live in this area , appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately 5@@ 0,000 to 7@@ 0,000 people , who live in this community of self-@@ built mul@@ ti@@ -@@ story h@@ ous@@ es where up to three gener@@ ations live in one structure ."
"W@@ hi@@ le these a@@ part@@ ments that they built for themselves ap@@ pe@@ ar to l@@ ack any plan@@ ning or form@@ al g@@ ri@@ d , each family speci@@ aliz@@ ing in a certain form of re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling means that the ground flo@@ or of each a@@ part@@ ment is re@@ ser@@ ved for gar@@ b@@ ag@@ e-@@ re@@ lated acti@@ vi@@ ties and the u@@ pp@@ er flo@@ or is de@@ di@@ c@@ ated to living space ."
"I find it incredible to see how these pi@@ les and pi@@ les of gar@@ b@@ age are in@@ visi@@ ble to the people who live there , like this very di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ i@@ shed man who is pos@@ ing while all this gar@@ b@@ age is sort of stre@@ am@@ ing out behind him , or like these two young men who are sitting and ch@@ at@@ ting am@@ on@@ g@@ st these t@@ ons of gar@@ b@@ age ."
"W@@ hi@@ le to most of us , living am@@ on@@ g@@ st these pi@@ les and pi@@ les of gar@@ b@@ age may se@@ em tot@@ ally un@@ in@@ ha@@ bi@@ table , to those in the Z@@ ab@@ b@@ ale@@ en , this is just a different ty@@ pe of nor@@ mal ."
"In all these places I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about today , what I do find fas@@ cin@@ ating is that there &apos;s really no such thing as nor@@ mal , and it pro@@ ves that people are able to ad@@ ap@@ t to any kind of situ@@ ation ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out the day , it &apos;s quite common to come across a small par@@ ty taking place in the stre@@ ets , just like this eng@@ ag@@ ement par@@ ty ."
"In this tra@@ di@@ tion , the bri@@ de@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ be disp@@ la@@ ys all of their be@@ lon@@ gin@@ gs , which they so@@ on bring to their new h@@ us@@ b@@ and ."
A ga@@ ther@@ ing like this one of@@ f@@ ers such a ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posi@@ tion where all the new stuff is disp@@ la@@ yed and all the gar@@ b@@ age is used as pro@@ ps to disp@@ l@@ ay all their new home ac@@ ces@@ sor@@ ies .
"L@@ i@@ ke M@@ ak@@ o@@ ko and the T@@ or@@ re Davi@@ d , throu@@ gh@@ out the Z@@ ab@@ b@@ ale@@ en you &apos;ll find all the same fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ies as in any ty@@ pi@@ cal neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
"There are the re@@ ta@@ il sh@@ op@@ s , the ca@@ f@@ es and the re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts , and the community is this community of C@@ op@@ tic Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans , so you &apos;ll also find a ch@@ ur@@ ch , along with the s@@ co@@ res of religi@@ ous i@@ con@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ies throu@@ gh@@ out the area , and also all the every@@ day ser@@ vi@@ ces like the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic re@@ pa@@ ir sh@@ op@@ s , the bar@@ bers , everything ."
V@@ i@@ si@@ ting the hom@@ es of the Z@@ ab@@ b@@ ale@@ en is also full of sur@@ pri@@ ses .
"W@@ hi@@ le from the outside , these hom@@ es look like any other inform@@ al structure in the city , when you ste@@ p inside , you are met with all man@@ ner of design deci@@ sions and inter@@ i@@ or de@@ cor@@ ation ."
"D@@ es@@ pi@@ te having li@@ mi@@ ted ac@@ cess to space and money , the hom@@ es in the area are desig@@ ned with care and de@@ ta@@ il ."
"E@@ very a@@ part@@ ment is uni@@ qu@@ e , and this individu@@ ality tel@@ ls a story about each family &apos;s cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces and val@@ u@@ es ."
"M@@ any of these people take their hom@@ es and inter@@ i@@ or sp@@ ac@@ es very seri@@ ously , pu@@ tting a lot of work and care into the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s ."
"The sh@@ ared sp@@ ac@@ es are also tre@@ ated in the same man@@ ner , where wal@@ ls are de@@ cor@@ ated in f@@ au@@ x mar@@ ble pat@@ ter@@ ns ."
"But des@@ pi@@ te this el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate dec@@ or , sometimes these a@@ part@@ ments are used in very u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted ways , like this home which ca@@ u@@ ght my at@@ ten@@ tion while all the mu@@ d and the gra@@ ss was liter@@ ally see@@ ping out under the front door ."
"When I was let in , it ap@@ pe@@ ared that this fi@@ f@@ th@@ -@@ flo@@ or a@@ part@@ ment was being trans@@ form@@ ed into a comple@@ te ani@@ mal far@@ m , where six or seven c@@ ow@@ s sto@@ od gra@@ z@@ ing in what o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se would be the living room ."
But then in the a@@ part@@ ment across the h@@ all from this c@@ ow shed lives a ne@@ w@@ ly mar@@ ried couple in what lo@@ cal@@ s descri@@ be as one of the nic@@ est a@@ part@@ ments in the area .
"The at@@ ten@@ tion to this de@@ ta@@ il ast@@ oni@@ shed me , and as the ow@@ ner of the home so pro@@ ud@@ ly led me around this a@@ part@@ ment , from flo@@ or to ce@@ il@@ ing , every part was de@@ cor@@ ated ."
"What mo@@ ved me the most was that des@@ pi@@ te these seem@@ ing@@ ly in@@ ho@@ spit@@ able con@@ di@@ tions , I was wel@@ com@@ ed with open ar@@ ms into a home that was made with love , care , and un@@ re@@ ser@@ ved pas@@ sion ."
"L@@ et &apos;s move across the ma@@ p to China , to an area called S@@ h@@ an@@ x@@ i , H@@ en@@ an and G@@ ans@@ u ."
"In a regi@@ on fam@@ ous for the so@@ ft , po@@ rou@@ s L@@ o@@ ess P@@ lat@@ e@@ a@@ u so@@ il , there li@@ ved until re@@ cent@@ ly an est@@ im@@ ated 40 million people in these h@@ ous@@ es under@@ ground ."
These dw@@ el@@ lin@@ gs are called the y@@ a@@ od@@ on@@ gs .
"Th@@ rou@@ gh this archite@@ cture by sub@@ trac@@ tion , these y@@ a@@ od@@ on@@ gs are built liter@@ ally inside of the so@@ il ."
"In these vi@@ ll@@ ages , you see an enti@@ re@@ ly alter@@ ed land@@ s@@ cape , and hi@@ d@@ den behind these m@@ oun@@ ds of di@@ r@@ t are these squ@@ are , re@@ ct@@ ang@@ ul@@ ar h@@ ous@@ es which si@@ t seven me@@ ters be@@ low the ground ."
"When I asked people why they were di@@ gg@@ ing their h@@ ous@@ es from the ground , they simply re@@ pl@@ ied that they are po@@ or whe@@ at and app@@ le farm@@ ers who didn &apos;t have the money to bu@@ y materi@@ als , and this di@@ gg@@ ing out was their most logi@@ cal form of living ."
"F@@ ro@@ m M@@ ak@@ o@@ ko to Z@@ ab@@ b@@ ale@@ en , these communi@@ ties have appro@@ ach@@ ed the t@@ as@@ ks of plan@@ ning , design and man@@ ag@@ ement of their communi@@ ties and neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods in ways that re@@ spo@@ nd speci@@ fi@@ cally to their environment and cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces ."
"C@@ re@@ ated by these very people who live , work and play in these particular sp@@ ac@@ es , these neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods are in@@ tu@@ i@@ ti@@ vely desig@@ ned to make the most of their cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces ."
What makes places like the T@@ or@@ re Davi@@ d parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly re@@ mark@@ able is this sort of sk@@ ele@@ ton fra@@ me@@ work where people can have a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation where they can ta@@ p into .
"Now imagine what these already ing@@ eni@@ ous communi@@ ties could create themselves , and how high@@ ly particular their solu@@ tions would be , if they were given the basi@@ c in@@ fra@@ stru@@ ctures that they could ta@@ p into ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , you see these large resi@@ den@@ tial develo@@ pment proje@@ cts which of@@ f@@ er co@@ o@@ kie@@ -@@ cu@@ t@@ ter h@@ ous@@ ing solu@@ tions to mas@@ sive amoun@@ ts of people ."
"F@@ ro@@ m China to B@@ raz@@ il , these proje@@ cts at@@ tem@@ pt to provi@@ de as many h@@ ous@@ es as possible , but they &apos;re completely gen@@ eri@@ c and simply do not work as an answer to the individu@@ al needs of the people ."
"I would like to end with a quot@@ e from a friend of m@@ ine and a source of in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation , Z@@ i@@ ta C@@ ob@@ b , the f@@ oun@@ der of the wonderful S@@ ho@@ ref@@ ast F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation , based out of F@@ o@@ go Is@@ land , N@@ ew@@ f@@ oun@@ d@@ land ."

Thank you .
( Applause )
"One of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te par@@ ts of my job at the G@@ ates F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation is that I get to tra@@ vel to the develo@@ ping world , and I do that quite regu@@ lar@@ ly ."
"And when I me@@ et the mo@@ thers in so many of these re@@ mot@@ e places , I &apos;m really stru@@ ck by the things that we have in common ."
"They want what we want for our children and that is for their children to gro@@ w up suc@@ cess@@ ful , to be health@@ y , and to have a suc@@ cess@@ ful life ."
"But I also see lots of po@@ ver@@ ty , and it &apos;s quite j@@ ar@@ ring , both in the scale and the sc@@ op@@ e of it ."
"My first tri@@ p in Indi@@ a , I was in a person &apos;s home where they had di@@ r@@ t flo@@ ors , no ru@@ n@@ ning water , no electri@@ city , and that &apos;s really what I see all over the world ."
"So in shor@@ t , I &apos;m star@@ t@@ led by all the things that they don &apos;t have ."
But I am sur@@ pri@@ sed by one thing that they do have : Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a .
Co@@ ke is every@@ where .
"In fact , when I tra@@ vel to the develo@@ ping world , Co@@ ke feel@@ s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"And so when I come back from these tri@@ ps , and I &apos;m thinking about develo@@ pment , and I &apos;m fl@@ ying home and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; We &apos;re trying to deli@@ ver con@@ dom@@ s to people or vac@@ cin@@ ations , &quot; you know , Co@@ ke &apos;s suc@@ cess kind of stop@@ s and makes you won@@ der : how is it that they can get Co@@ ke to these far@@ -@@ flu@@ n@@ g places ?"
"If they can do that , why can &apos;t govern@@ ments and N@@ G@@ O@@ s do the same thing ?"
And I &apos;m not the first person to ask this question .
"But I think , as a community , we still have a lot to learn ."
"It &apos;s st@@ ag@@ g@@ ering , if you think about Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a ."
They se@@ ll 1@@ .@@ 5 billion ser@@ v@@ ings every single day .
"That &apos;s like every man , woman and child on the planet having a ser@@ ving of Co@@ ke every week ."
So why does this matter ?
"Well , if we &apos;re going to speed up the pro@@ gre@@ ss and go even f@@ ast@@ er on the set of M@@ il@@ len@@ ni@@ um D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ pment Go@@ als that we &apos;re set as a world , we need to learn from the in@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ ors , and those in@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ ors come from every single se@@ ctor ."
"I feel that , if we can understand what makes something like Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous , we can app@@ ly those l@@ ess@@ ons then for the public good ."
"C@@ o@@ ke &apos;s suc@@ cess is rele@@ v@@ ant , because if we can an@@ al@@ y@@ ze it , learn from it , then we can sa@@ ve lives ."
So that &apos;s why I took a bit of time to study Co@@ ke .
And I think there are really three things we can take away from Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a .
They take re@@ al@@ -@@ time data and im@@ medi@@ ately fe@@ ed it back into the produ@@ ct .
"They ta@@ p into local ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ u@@ ri@@ al tal@@ ent , and they do incredible marke@@ ting ."
So let &apos;s start with the data .
"Now Co@@ ke has a very clear bot@@ tom line — they re@@ port to a set of sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders , they have to turn a prof@@ it ."
"So they take the data , and they use it to meas@@ ure pro@@ gre@@ ss ."
They have this very contin@@ u@@ ous fe@@ ed@@ back loo@@ p .
"They learn something , they put it back into the produ@@ ct , they put it back into the market ."
They have a whole team called &quot; &quot; K@@ now@@ le@@ dge and In@@ si@@ ght . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a lot like other con@@ sum@@ er comp@@ an@@ ies .
"So if you &apos;re ru@@ n@@ ning N@@ ami@@ bi@@ a for Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a , and you have a 10@@ 7 con@@ stitu@@ en@@ cies , you know where every can ver@@ su@@ s bot@@ tle of S@@ pri@@ te , F@@ an@@ ta or Co@@ ke was s@@ old , whether it was a cor@@ ner stor@@ e , a super@@ market or a p@@ us@@ h@@ car@@ t ."
"So if s@@ al@@ es start to dro@@ p , then the person can iden@@ ti@@ fy the problem and ad@@ dre@@ ss the issue ."
Let &apos;s con@@ tra@@ st that for a minu@@ te to develo@@ pment .
"In develo@@ pment , the ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation comes at the very end of the project ."
"I &apos;ve s@@ at in a lot of those me@@ et@@ ings , and by then , it is way too l@@ ate to use the data ."
I had somebody from an N@@ G@@ O once descri@@ be it to me as bow@@ ling in the dar@@ k .
"They said , &quot; &quot; You ro@@ ll the ball , you hear some p@@ ins go down ."
"It &apos;s dar@@ k , you can &apos;t see which one goes down until the li@@ ghts come on , and then you an see your impac@@ t . &quot; &quot; Re@@ al@@ -@@ time data turns on the li@@ ghts ."
So what &apos;s the second thing that Co@@ ke &apos;s good at ?
They &apos;re good at ta@@ pping into that local ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ u@@ ri@@ al tal@@ ent .
"C@@ o@@ ke &apos;s been in Africa since 19@@ 2@@ 8 , but most of the time they couldn &apos;t re@@ ach the di@@ st@@ ant marke@@ ts , because they had a system that was a lot like in the develo@@ ped world , which was a large tru@@ ck rol@@ ling down the stre@@ et ."
"And in Africa , the re@@ mot@@ e places , it &apos;s hard to find a good ro@@ ad ."
"But Co@@ ke noti@@ ced something — they noti@@ ced that local people were taking the produ@@ ct , bu@@ ying it in bu@@ l@@ k and then re@@ sel@@ ling it in these har@@ d-@@ to@@ -@@ re@@ ach places ."
And so they took a bit of time to learn about that .
"And they decided in 199@@ 0 that they wanted to start tra@@ ining the local ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s , gi@@ ving them small lo@@ ans ."
"They set them up as what they called micro@@ -@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion cen@@ ters , and those local ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s then hi@@ re s@@ al@@ es people , who go out with bi@@ cy@@ cles and p@@ us@@ h@@ car@@ ts and whe@@ el@@ bar@@ row@@ s to se@@ ll the produ@@ ct ."
"There are now some 3@@ ,000 of these cen@@ ters em@@ plo@@ ying about 1@@ 5@@ ,000 people in Africa ."
"In T@@ an@@ z@@ ania and U@@ g@@ an@@ da , they re@@ present 90 percent of Co@@ ke &apos;s s@@ al@@ es ."
Let &apos;s look at the develo@@ pment side .
What is it that govern@@ ments and N@@ G@@ O@@ s can learn from Co@@ ke ?
"G@@ over@@ n@@ ments and N@@ G@@ O@@ s need to ta@@ p into that local ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ u@@ ri@@ al tal@@ ent as well , because the lo@@ cal@@ s know how to re@@ ach the very har@@ d-@@ to@@ -@@ ser@@ ve places , their neigh@@ b@@ ors , and they know what moti@@ v@@ ates them to make change ."
I think a great example of this is E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia &apos;s new health ex@@ ten@@ sion program .
"The government noti@@ ced in E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia that many of the people were so far away from a health c@@ lin@@ ic , they were over a day &apos;s tra@@ vel away from a health c@@ lin@@ ic ."
"So if you &apos;re in an em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy situ@@ ation — or if you &apos;re a mo@@ m about to deli@@ ver a b@@ aby — for@@ get it , to get to the health care cen@@ ter ."
"They decided that wasn &apos;t good enough , so they went to Indi@@ a and stud@@ ied the Indi@@ an state of K@@ er@@ ala that also had a system like this , and they ad@@ ap@@ ted it for E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia ."
"And in 200@@ 3 , the government of E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia started this new system in their own country ."
"They tra@@ ined 3@@ 5@@ ,000 health ex@@ ten@@ sion wor@@ k@@ ers to deli@@ ver care dire@@ ct@@ ly to the people ."
"In just five years , their r@@ ati@@ o went from one wor@@ k@@ er for every 3@@ 0,000 people to one wor@@ k@@ er for every 2@@ ,@@ 500 people ."
"Now , think about how this can change people &apos;s lives ."
"H@@ e@@ alth ex@@ ten@@ sion wor@@ k@@ ers can help with so many things , whether it &apos;s family plan@@ ning , pr@@ en@@ at@@ al care , im@@ muni@@ z@@ ations for the children , or ad@@ vi@@ sing the woman to get to the fac@@ i@@ lity on time for an on-@@ time deli@@ very ."
"That is having real impac@@ t in a country like E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , and it &apos;s why you see their child mor@@ t@@ ality num@@ bers coming down 25 percent from 2@@ 000 to 200@@ 8 ."
"In E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , there are hundre@@ ds of thousands of children living because of this health ex@@ ten@@ sion wor@@ k@@ er program ."
So what &apos;s the next ste@@ p for E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia ?
"Well , they &apos;re already star@@ ting talk about this ."
"They &apos;re star@@ ting to talk about , &quot; &quot; How do you have the health community wor@@ k@@ ers gener@@ ate their own ideas ?"
How do you in@@ cent them based on the impac@@ t that they &apos;re getting out in those re@@ mot@@ e vi@@ ll@@ ages ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s how you ta@@ p into local ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ u@@ ri@@ al tal@@ ent and you un@@ lo@@ ck people &apos;s poten@@ tial .
The third com@@ pon@@ ent of Co@@ ke &apos;s suc@@ cess is marke@@ ting .
"U@@ l@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , Co@@ ke &apos;s suc@@ cess depen@@ ds on one c@@ ru@@ cial fact and that is that people want a Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a ."
Now the reason these micro@@ -@@ ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s can se@@ ll or make a prof@@ it is they have to se@@ ll every single bot@@ tle in their p@@ us@@ h@@ car@@ t or their whe@@ el@@ bar@@ row .
"So , they re@@ ly on Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a in terms of its marke@@ ting , and what &apos;s the se@@ cre@@ t to their marke@@ ting ?"
"Well , it &apos;s as@@ pi@@ r@@ ational ."
It is as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated that produ@@ ct with a kind of life that people want to live .
"So even though it &apos;s a global company , they take a very local appro@@ ach ."
Co@@ ke &apos;s global cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n s@@ log@@ an is &quot; &quot; O@@ p@@ en Ha@@ pp@@ iness . &quot; &quot; But they lo@@ c@@ ali@@ ze it .
And they don &apos;t just gu@@ ess what makes people happy ; they go to places like L@@ at@@ in America and they realize that happ@@ iness there is as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with family life .
"And in S@@ outh Africa , they as@@ so@@ ci@@ ate happ@@ iness with seri@@ t@@ i or community re@@ spe@@ ct ."
"Now , that pla@@ yed itself out in the World C@@ up cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n ."
"L@@ et &apos;s list@@ en to this s@@ ong that Co@@ ke created for it , &quot; &quot; W@@ av@@ in &apos; F@@ la@@ g &quot; &quot; by a S@@ om@@ ali hi@@ p ho@@ p arti@@ st ."
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) K &apos;@@ Na@@ an : ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o@@ -@@ oh ♫ ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♫ ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o@@ -@@ oh ♫ ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o@@ -@@ oh ♫ ♫ G@@ i@@ ve you fre@@ e@@ dom , give you fi@@ re ♫ ♫ G@@ i@@ ve you reason , take you high@@ er ♫ ♫ Se@@ e the ch@@ am@@ pi@@ ons take the fie@@ ld now ♫ ♫ You def@@ ine us , make us feel pro@@ u@@ d ♫ ♫ In the stre@@ ets our he@@ ads are li@@ f@@ ted ♫ ♫ A@@ s we lo@@ se our in@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion ♫ ♫ C@@ ele@@ br@@ ation , it &apos;s around us ♫ ♫ E@@ very n@@ ation , all around us ♫@@ "
"M@@ el@@ in@@ da F@@ ren@@ ch G@@ ates : It feel@@ s pretty good , right ?"
"Well , they didn &apos;t stop there — they lo@@ c@@ aliz@@ ed it into 18 different langu@@ ages ."
And it went number one on the po@@ p char@@ t in 1@@ 7 countries .
"It re@@ min@@ ds me of a s@@ ong that I remember from my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od , &quot; I &apos;d Li@@ ke to T@@ each the World to S@@ ing , &quot; that also went number one on the po@@ p char@@ ts ."
B@@ ot@@ h son@@ gs have something in common : that same ap@@ pe@@ al of ce@@ le@@ br@@ ation and uni@@ ty .
So how does health and develo@@ pment market ?
"Well , it &apos;s based on av@@ o@@ i@@ dance , not as@@ pi@@ r@@ ations ."
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard some of these mess@@ ages .
"&quot; U@@ se a con@@ dom , don &apos;t get AIDS . &quot;"
"&quot; W@@ as@@ h you h@@ ands , you might not get di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a . &quot;"
It doesn &apos;t sound anything like &quot; &quot; W@@ av@@ in &apos; F@@ la@@ g &quot; &quot; to me .
"And I think we make a fundam@@ ent@@ al mist@@ ake — we make an as@@ sum@@ ption , that we think that , if people need something , we don &apos;t have to make them want that ."
And I think that &apos;s a mist@@ ake .
And there &apos;s some indi@@ c@@ ations around the world that this is star@@ ting to change .
One example is s@@ ani@@ tation .
We know that a million and a half children die a year from di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a and a lot of it is because of open de@@ fe@@ cation .
But there &apos;s a solution : you build a to@@ i@@ let .
"But what we &apos;re fin@@ ding around the world , over and over again , is , if you build a to@@ i@@ let and you leave it there , it doesn &apos;t get used ."
Pe@@ ople re@@ use it for a s@@ la@@ b for their home .
They sometimes stor@@ e gra@@ in in it .
I &apos;ve even seen it used for a chi@@ ck@@ en co@@ o@@ p .
( Laughter ) But what does marke@@ ting really ent@@ a@@ il that would make a s@@ ani@@ tation solution get a resul@@ t in di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a ?
"Well , you work with the community ."
"You start to talk to them about why open de@@ fe@@ cation is something that sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be done in the vi@@ ll@@ age , and they ag@@ ree to that ."
"But then you take the to@@ i@@ let and you posi@@ tion it as a moder@@ n , tr@@ en@@ dy con@@ ven@@ ience ."
One state in Nor@@ ther@@ n Indi@@ a has gone so far as to lin@@ k to@@ i@@ le@@ ts to cour@@ t@@ ship .
And it works — look at these he@@ ad@@ lin@@ es .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m not ki@@ d@@ ding .
W@@ om@@ en are ref@@ using to mar@@ ry men without to@@ i@@ le@@ ts .
"No lo@@ o , no &quot; &quot; I do . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , it &apos;s not just a fun@@ ny he@@ ad@@ line — it &apos;s in@@ no@@ v@@ ative . It &apos;s an in@@ no@@ v@@ ative marke@@ ting cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n ."
"But more import@@ an@@ tly , it sa@@ ves lives ."
"T@@ ake a look at this — this is a room full of young men and my h@@ us@@ b@@ and , Bi@@ ll ."
And can you gu@@ ess what the young men are wai@@ ting for ?
They &apos;re wai@@ ting to be cir@@ cu@@ m@@ ci@@ sed .
C@@ an you you believe that ?
We know that cir@@ cu@@ m@@ ci@@ sion redu@@ ces HIV in@@ fe@@ ction by 60 percent in men .
"And when we first heard this resul@@ t inside the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation , I have to ad@@ m@@ it , Bi@@ ll and I were sc@@ rat@@ ching our he@@ ads a little bit and we were saying , &quot; &quot; But who &apos;s going to vol@@ un@@ te@@ er for this pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re ? &quot; &quot; But it turns out the men do , because they &apos;re hear@@ ing from their gir@@ l@@ friends that they pre@@ f@@ er it , and the men also believe it impro@@ ves their se@@ x life ."
"So if we can start to understand what people really want in health and develo@@ pment , we can change communi@@ ties and we can change whole n@@ ations ."
"Well , why is all of this so important ?"
"So let &apos;s talk about what happens when this all comes together , when you t@@ ie the three things together ."
"And poli@@ o , I think , is one of the most powerful exam@@ ples ."
We &apos;ve seen a 9@@ 9 percent redu@@ ction in poli@@ o in 20 years .
"So if you look back to 19@@ 8@@ 8 , there are about 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 c@@ ases of poli@@ o on the planet that year ."
"In 200@@ 9 , we &apos;re down to 1@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 c@@ ases ."
Well how did that happen ?
Let &apos;s look at a country like Indi@@ a .
"They have over a billion people in this country , but they have 3@@ 5@@ ,000 local do@@ ct@@ ors who re@@ port par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s , and c@@ lini@@ ci@@ ans , a huge re@@ por@@ ting system in chemi@@ sts ."
They have two and a half million vac@@ cin@@ at@@ ors .
But let me make the story a little bit more con@@ cre@@ te for you .
"L@@ et me tell you the story of S@@ h@@ ri@@ ra@@ m , an 18 mon@@ th bo@@ y in Bi@@ ha@@ r , a nor@@ ther@@ n state in Indi@@ a ."
"This year on Au@@ g@@ ust 8@@ th , he felt par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s and on the 1@@ 3@@ th , his parents took him to the do@@ ctor ."
"O@@ n Au@@ g@@ ust 1@@ 4@@ th and 1@@ 5@@ th , they took a sto@@ ol sam@@ ple , and by the 2@@ 5@@ th of Au@@ g@@ ust , it was con@@ fir@@ med he had Ty@@ pe 1 poli@@ o ."
"B@@ y Au@@ g@@ ust 3@@ 0@@ th , a gen@@ e@@ tic test was done , and we knew what stra@@ in of poli@@ o S@@ h@@ ri@@ ra@@ m had ."
Now it could have come from one of two places .
"It could have come from Ne@@ p@@ al , just to the nor@@ th , across the bor@@ der , or from J@@ har@@ k@@ hand , a state just to the s@@ outh ."
"Lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly , the gen@@ e@@ tic test@@ ing pro@@ ved that , in fact , this str@@ and came nor@@ th , because , had it come from the s@@ outh , it would have had a much wi@@ der impac@@ t in terms of trans@@ mis@@ sion ."
So many more people would have been af@@ fe@@ cted .
So what &apos;s the en@@ d@@ g@@ ame ?
"Well on Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 4@@ th , there was a huge mo@@ p@@ -@@ up cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , which is what you do in poli@@ o ."
"They went out and where S@@ h@@ ri@@ ra@@ m lives , they vac@@ cin@@ ated two million people ."
"So in less than a mon@@ th , we went from one case of par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s to a tar@@ ge@@ ted vac@@ cin@@ ation program ."
And I &apos;m happy to say only one other person in that area got poli@@ o .
"That &apos;s how you keep a huge out@@ bre@@ ak from sp@@ re@@ ading , and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their h@@ ands ; they can sa@@ ve lives ."
"Now one of the challen@@ ges in poli@@ o , still , is marke@@ ting , but it might not be what you think ."
It &apos;s not the marke@@ ting on the ground .
"It &apos;s not tel@@ ling the parents , &quot; &quot; If you see par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s , take your child to the do@@ ctor or get your child vac@@ cin@@ ated . &quot; &quot; We have a problem with marke@@ ting in the d@@ on@@ or community ."
"The G@@ 8 n@@ ations have been incredi@@ bly gener@@ ous on poli@@ o over the last 20 years , but we &apos;re star@@ ting to have something called poli@@ o f@@ ati@@ gu@@ e and that is that the d@@ on@@ or n@@ ations ar@@ en &apos;t wil@@ ling to fu@@ nd poli@@ o any longer ."
"So by next sum@@ m@@ er , we &apos;re si@@ gh@@ ted to run out of money on poli@@ o ."
So we are 9@@ 9 percent of the way there on this go@@ al and we &apos;re about to run shor@@ t of money .
"And I think that if the marke@@ ting were more as@@ pi@@ r@@ ational , if we could fo@@ cus as a community on how far we &apos;ve come and how amazing it would be to er@@ ad@@ i@@ cate this dise@@ ase , we could put poli@@ o f@@ ati@@ gu@@ e and poli@@ o behind us ."
"And if we could do that , we could stop vac@@ cin@@ ating everybody , wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de , in all of our countries for poli@@ o ."
And it would only be the second dise@@ ase ever wi@@ ped off the face of the planet .
And we are so close .
And this vi@@ ct@@ ory is so possible .
"So if Co@@ ke &apos;s marke@@ ters came to me and asked me to def@@ ine happ@@ iness , I &apos;d say my vision of happ@@ iness is a mother hol@@ ding health@@ y b@@ aby in her ar@@ ms ."
"To me , that is de@@ ep happ@@ iness ."
"And so if we can learn l@@ ess@@ ons from the in@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ ors in every se@@ ctor , then in the future we make together , that happ@@ iness can be just as u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous as Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"As you poin@@ ted out , every time you come here , you learn something ."
"This morning , the world &apos;s exper@@ ts from I gu@@ ess three or four different comp@@ an@@ ies on building se@@ ats , I think con@@ clu@@ ded that ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , the solution is , people sh@@ ouldn &apos;t si@@ t down ."
I could have told them that .
"( Laughter ) Y@@ est@@ er@@ day , the au@@ tom@@ oti@@ ve guys gave us some new in@@ si@@ ghts ."
"They poin@@ ted out that , I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today , they will be ste@@ ering cars by wi@@ re , without all that mechani@@ cal stuff ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s reas@@ sur@@ ing .
"( Applause ) They then poin@@ ted out that there &apos;d be , sort of , the other contro@@ ls by wi@@ re , to get ri@@ d of all that mechani@@ cal stuff ."
"That &apos;s pretty good , but why not get ri@@ d of the wi@@ res ?"
"Th@@ en you don &apos;t need anything to control the car , ex@@ cept thinking about it ."
"I would love to talk about the technology , and some@@ time , in what &apos;s past the 15 minutes , I &apos;ll be happy to talk to all the techno@@ -@@ ge@@ e@@ ks around here about what &apos;s in here ."
"But if I had one thing to say about this , before we get to first , it would be that from the time we started building this , the big idea wasn &apos;t the technology ."
It really was a big idea in technology when we started ap@@ pl@@ ying it in the i@@ B@@ O@@ T for the dis@@ ab@@ led community .
"The big idea here is , I think , a new piece of a solution to a fa@@ ir@@ ly big problem in transpor@@ tation ."
"And maybe to put that in perspe@@ ctive : there &apos;s so much data on this , I &apos;ll be happy to give it to you in different form@@ s ."
"You never know what stri@@ k@@ es the fan@@ cy of wh@@ om , but everybody is perfe@@ ct@@ ly wil@@ ling to believe the car changed the world ."
"And H@@ en@@ ry F@@ or@@ d , just about 100 years ago , started c@@ ran@@ king out Mo@@ de@@ l T@@ s ."
What I don &apos;t think most people think about is the con@@ te@@ xt of how technology is ap@@ pl@@ ied .
"For in@@ stance , in that time , 9@@ 1 percent of America li@@ ved either on far@@ ms or in small tow@@ ns ."
"So , the car — the hor@@ sel@@ ess car@@ ri@@ age that re@@ plac@@ ed the hor@@ se and car@@ ri@@ age — was a big deal ; it went t@@ wi@@ ce as f@@ ast as a hor@@ se and car@@ ri@@ age ."
It was half as long .
"And it was an environ@@ ment@@ al impro@@ v@@ ement , because , for in@@ stance , in 19@@ 0@@ 3 they out@@ l@@ aw@@ ed hor@@ ses and bu@@ gg@@ ies in dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an , because you can imagine what the ro@@ ads look like when you have a million hor@@ ses , and a million of them ur@@ in@@ ating and doing other things , and the ty@@ ph@@ o@@ id and other problems created were almost uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able ."
So the car was the cle@@ an environ@@ ment@@ al alter@@ n@@ ative to a hor@@ se and bu@@ g@@ gy .
"It also was a way for people to get from their far@@ m to a far@@ m , or their far@@ m to a tow@@ n , or from a tow@@ n to a city ."
"It all made sense , with 9@@ 1 percent of the people living there ."
"B@@ y the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , we started conne@@ cting all the tow@@ ns together with what a lot of people c@@ la@@ im is the e@@ igh@@ th won@@ der of the world , the high@@ way system ."
And it is cer@@ tain@@ ly a won@@ der .
"And by the way , as I take sh@@ ots at old technolog@@ ies , I want to as@@ sure everybody , and parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly the au@@ tom@@ oti@@ ve indu@@ stry — who &apos;s been very sup@@ por@@ tive of us — that I don &apos;t think this in any way compe@@ tes with air@@ plan@@ es , or cars ."
But think about where the world is today .
50 percent of the global popul@@ ation now lives in cities .
That &apos;s 3@@ .@@ 2 billion people .
We &apos;ve sol@@ ved all the transpor@@ tation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today .
"@@ 500 years ago , sa@@ il@@ ing ships started getting reli@@ able enough ; we found a new contin@@ ent ."
"@@ 1@@ 50 years ago , lo@@ com@@ oti@@ ves got ef@@ fi@@ cient enough , ste@@ am power , that we turned the contin@@ ent into a country ."
"O@@ ver the last hundre@@ d years , we started building cars , and then over the 50 years we &apos;ve conne@@ cted every city to every other city in an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly ef@@ fi@@ cient way , and we have a very high stan@@ d@@ ard of living as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of that ."
"But during that entire process , more and more people have been born , and more and more people are moving to cities ."
China alone is going to move four to six hundre@@ d million people into cities in the next dec@@ ade and a half .
"And so , no@@ body , I think , would ar@@ gu@@ e that air@@ plan@@ es , in the last 50 years , have turned the contin@@ ent and the country now into a neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
"And if you just look at how technology has been ap@@ pl@@ ied , we &apos;ve sol@@ ved all the lon@@ g@@ -@@ r@@ ange , high-@@ speed , high-@@ v@@ olu@@ me , lar@@ ge@@ -@@ we@@ ight problems of moving things around ."
N@@ ob@@ ody would want to give them up .
"And I cer@@ tain@@ ly wouldn &apos;t want to give up my air@@ pl@@ ane , or my he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter , or my H@@ um@@ ve@@ e , or my P@@ or@@ sch@@ e ."
I love them all . I don &apos;t keep any of them in my living room .
"The fact is , the last mi@@ le is the problem , and half the world now lives in den@@ se cities ."
"And people spend , depen@@ ding on who they are , between 90 and 9@@ 5 percent of their energy getting around on fo@@ ot ."
"I think there &apos;s — I don &apos;t know what data would im@@ pre@@ ss you , but how about , 4@@ 3 percent of the re@@ fin@@ ed fu@@ el produ@@ ced in the world is con@@ sum@@ ed by cars in me@@ tro@@ po@@ lit@@ an are@@ as in the United States ."
"Th@@ ree million people die every year in cities du@@ e to bad air , and almost all parti@@ cul@@ ate pol@@ lu@@ tion on this planet is produ@@ ced by transpor@@ tation de@@ vi@@ ces , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly sitting in cities ."
"And again , I say that not to att@@ ack any indu@@ stry , I think — I really do — I love my air@@ pl@@ ane , and cars on high@@ ways moving 60 miles an hour are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly ef@@ fi@@ cient , both from an engine@@ ering point of view , an energy con@@ sum@@ ption point of view , and a u@@ ti@@ lity point of view ."
"And we all love our cars , and I do ."
"The problem is , you get into the city and you want to go four blo@@ cks , it &apos;s ne@@ i@@ ther fun no@@ r ef@@ fi@@ cient no@@ r produ@@ ctive ."
It &apos;s not susta@@ in@@ able .
"If — in China , in the year 199@@ 8 , 4@@ 1@@ 7 million people used bi@@ cy@@ cles ; 1@@ .@@ 7 million people used cars ."
"If five percent of that popul@@ ation became , quot@@ e , mi@@ ddle clas@@ s , and wanted to go the way we &apos;ve gone in the last hundre@@ d years at the same time that 50 percent of their popul@@ ation are moving into cities of the size and den@@ sity of M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an , every six weeks — it isn &apos;t susta@@ in@@ able environ@@ ment@@ ally ; it isn &apos;t susta@@ in@@ able econ@@ omi@@ cally — there just a@@ in &apos;t enough oil — and it &apos;s not susta@@ in@@ able poli@@ ti@@ cally ."
"I mean , what are we fi@@ gh@@ ting over right now ?"
"We can make it comp@@ lic@@ ated , but what &apos;s the world fi@@ gh@@ ting over right now ?"
"So it seem@@ ed to me that somebody had to work on that last mi@@ le , and it was du@@ m@@ b lu@@ ck . We were working on i@@ B@@ O@@ T@@ s , but once we made this , we in@@ stan@@ tly decided it could be a great alter@@ n@@ ative to je@@ t sk@@ is . You don &apos;t need the water ."
O@@ r s@@ now@@ mo@@ bi@@ les . You don &apos;t need the s@@ now .
"O@@ r sk@@ i@@ ing . It &apos;s just fun , and people love to move around doing fun things ."
"And every one of those indu@@ str@@ ies , by the way — just g@@ ol@@ f car@@ ts alone is a mul@@ ti@@ -@@ bi@@ lli@@ on-@@ dol@@ lar indu@@ stry ."
"But rather than go li@@ cen@@ se this off , which is what we nor@@ m@@ ally do , it seem@@ ed to me that if we put all our ef@@ for@@ t not into the technology , but into an under@@ standing of a world that &apos;s sol@@ ved all its other problems , but has some@@ how come to ac@@ cept that cities — which , right back from an@@ cient Gre@@ e@@ ce on , were me@@ ant to walk around , cities that were archite@@ cted and built for people — now have a fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int that , while we &apos;ve sol@@ ved every other transpor@@ tation problem — and it &apos;s like Mo@@ ore &apos;s la@@ w ."
"I mean , look at the time it took to c@@ ross a contin@@ ent in a Con@@ est@@ og@@ a wa@@ g@@ on , then on a ra@@ il@@ ro@@ ad , then an air@@ pl@@ ane ."
E@@ very other form of transpor@@ tation &apos;s been impro@@ ved .
"In 5@@ ,000 years , we &apos;ve gone back@@ war@@ ds in getting around cities ."
They &apos;ve got@@ ten bi@@ g@@ ger ; they &apos;re sp@@ read out .
"The most ex@@ pen@@ sive real est@@ ate on this planet in every city — W@@ il@@ shi@@ re B@@ ou@@ le@@ v@@ ard , or F@@ i@@ f@@ th A@@ ven@@ ue , or T@@ ok@@ y@@ o , or Par@@ is — the most ex@@ pen@@ sive real est@@ ate is their dow@@ n@@ tow@@ ns ."
6@@ 5 percent of the land@@ mas@@ s of our cities are par@@ ked cars .
The 20 largest cities in the world .
"So you won@@ der , what if cities could give to their pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans what we take for gran@@ ted as we now go between cities ?"
"What if you could make them fun , at@@ trac@@ tive , cle@@ an , environ@@ ment@@ ally frien@@ d@@ ly ?"
"What if it would make it a little bit more pal@@ at@@ able to have ac@@ cess vi@@ a this , as that last lin@@ k to mas@@ s tran@@ si@@ t , to get out to your cars so we can all live in the su@@ bur@@ b@@ s and use our cars the way we want , and then have our cities energi@@ zed again ?"
"We thought it would be really ne@@ at to do that , and one of the problems we really were wor@@ ried about is : how do we get leg@@ al on the si@@ de@@ walk ?"
Because techni@@ cally I &apos;ve got mot@@ ors ; I &apos;ve got whe@@ els — I &apos;m a mot@@ or ve@@ hi@@ cle .
I don &apos;t look like a mot@@ or ve@@ hi@@ cle .
I have the same fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int as a pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an ; I have the same uni@@ qu@@ e cap@@ ability to deal with other pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans in a c@@ row@@ ded space .
"I took this down to G@@ round Z@@ er@@ o , and k@@ noc@@ ked my way through c@@ row@@ ds for an hour ."
"I &apos;m a pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an . But the la@@ w ty@@ pi@@ cally l@@ ag@@ s technology by a gener@@ ation or two , and if we get told we don &apos;t be@@ long on the si@@ de@@ walk , we have two cho@@ i@@ ces ."
"We &apos;re a re@@ cre@@ ational ve@@ hi@@ cle that doesn &apos;t really matter , and I don &apos;t spend my time doing that kind of stuff ."
O@@ r maybe we should be out in the stre@@ et in front of a Gre@@ y@@ h@@ ound bu@@ s or a ve@@ hi@@ cle .
"We &apos;ve been so con@@ cer@@ ned about that , we went to the P@@ ost@@ ma@@ ster G@@ ener@@ al of the United States , as the first person we ever show@@ ed on the outside , and said , &quot; &quot; P@@ u@@ t your people on it . E@@ very@@ body tru@@ sts their post@@ man ."
"And they be@@ long on the si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks , and they &apos;ll use it seri@@ ously . &quot; &quot; He ag@@ re@@ ed . We went to a number of poli@@ ce de@@ part@@ ments that want their poli@@ ce offi@@ c@@ ers back in the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od on the be@@ at , car@@ ry@@ ing 70 po@@ un@@ ds of stuff . They love it ."
And I can &apos;t believe a poli@@ c@@ em@@ an is going to give themselves a ti@@ ck@@ et .
"( Laughter ) So we &apos;ve been working really , really hard , but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develo@@ p as an at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de about what &apos;s important , and how to app@@ ly the technology ."
"We went out and we found some visi@@ on@@ ary people with enough money to let us design and build these things , and in hop@@ e@@ fully enough time to get them ac@@ cep@@ ted ."
"So , I &apos;m happy , really , I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want ."
"And y@@ es , it &apos;s really fun , and y@@ es , you should all go out and try it ."
"But if I could ask you to do one thing , it &apos;s not to think about it as a piece of technology , but just imagine that , al@@ though we all understand some@@ how that it &apos;s reas@@ on@@ able that we use our 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ po@@ u@@ nd mach@@ ine , which can go 60 miles an hour , that can bring you every@@ where you want to go , and some@@ how it &apos;s also what we used for the last mi@@ le , and it &apos;s bro@@ k@@ en , and it doesn &apos;t work ."
"One of the more exci@@ ting things that oc@@ cur@@ red to us about why it might get ac@@ cep@@ ted , happened out here in C@@ alifor@@ nia ."
"A few weeks ago , after we la@@ un@@ ched it , we were here with a news cre@@ w on V@@ eni@@ ce Be@@ ach , zi@@ pping up and back , and he &apos;s mar@@ v@@ el@@ ing at the technology , and me@@ an@@ while bi@@ cy@@ cles are zi@@ pping by , and sk@@ ate@@ bo@@ ar@@ ders are zi@@ pping by , and a little old l@@ ady — I mean , if you looked in the di@@ cti@@ on@@ ary , a little old l@@ ady — came by me — and now that I &apos;m on this , I &apos;m the he@@ ight of a nor@@ mal ad@@ ul@@ t now — and she just stop@@ s , and the cam@@ era is there , and she looks up at me and says , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I try that ? &quot; &quot; And what was I — you know , how are you going to say anything ?"
"And so I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ ure . &quot; &quot; So I get off , and she gets on , and with a little bit of the usu@@ al , ah , then she turns around , and she goes about 20 fe@@ et , and she turns back around , and she &apos;s all s@@ miles ."
"And she comes back to me and she stop@@ s , and she says , &quot; F@@ in@@ ally , they made something for us . &quot;"
And the cam@@ era is looking down at her .
"I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , that was great — ( Laughter ) — ple@@ ase l@@ ady , don &apos;t say another word . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the cam@@ era is down at her , and this guy has to put the micro@@ phone in her face , said , &quot; &quot; What do you mean by that ? &quot; &quot; And I figu@@ red , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s all over now , &quot; &quot; and she looks up and she says , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; she &apos;s still wat@@ ching these guys go ; she says , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t ri@@ de a bi@@ ke , &quot; &quot; no , she says , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t use a sk@@ ate@@ bo@@ ard , and I &apos;ve never used rol@@ ler b@@ la@@ des , &quot; &quot; she knew them by name ; she says , &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s been 50 years since I ro@@ de a bi@@ cy@@ cle . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en she looks up , she &apos;s looking up , and she says ,"
"&quot; &quot; And I &apos;m 8@@ 1 years old , and I don &apos;t dri@@ ve a car any@@ more ."
"I still have to get to the stor@@ e , and I can &apos;t car@@ ry a lot of things . &quot; &quot; And it sud@@ den@@ ly oc@@ cur@@ red to me , that am@@ ong my many fe@@ ars , were not just that the bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ rac@@ y and the regu@@ lat@@ ors and the le@@ gi@@ s@@ lat@@ ors might not get it — it was that , fundam@@ ent@@ ally , you believe there &apos;s pres@@ sure am@@ ong the people not to inv@@ ade the most pre@@ ci@@ ous little bit of space left , the si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks in these cities ."
"When you look at the 3@@ 6 in@@ ch@@ es of leg@@ al requi@@ re@@ ment for si@@ de@@ walk , then the eight fo@@ ot for the par@@ ked car , then the three lan@@ es , and then the other eight fe@@ et — it &apos;s — that little piece is all that &apos;s there ."
"But she looks up and says this , and it oc@@ cur@@ s to me , well , kids ar@@ en &apos;t going to mind these things , and they don &apos;t v@@ ot@@ e , and business people and then young ad@@ ul@@ ts ar@@ en &apos;t going to mind these things — they &apos;re pretty cool — so I gu@@ ess su@@ bli@@ min@@ ally I was wor@@ ried that it &apos;s the ol@@ der popul@@ ation that &apos;s going to wor@@ ry ."
"So , having seen this , and having wor@@ ried about it for eight years , the first thing I do is pi@@ ck up my phone and ask our marke@@ ting and regu@@ lat@@ ory guys , call A@@ A@@ R@@ P , get an ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment right away ."
We &apos;ve got to show them this thing .
"And they took it to W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton ; they show@@ ed them ; and they &apos;re going to be inv@@ olved now , wat@@ ching how these things get ab@@ sor@@ bed in a number of cities , like At@@ lan@@ ta , where we &apos;re doing tri@@ als to see if it really can , in fact , help re@@ -@@ energi@@ ze their dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n ."
"( Applause ) The bot@@ tom line is , whether you believe the United N@@ ations , or any of the other think tan@@ ks — in the next 20 years , all human popul@@ ation grow@@ th on this planet will be in cities ."
"In A@@ si@@ a alone , it will be over a billion people ."
They learned to start with cell ph@@ ones .
They didn &apos;t have to take the 10@@ 0-@@ year tri@@ p we took .
They start at the top of the technology food cha@@ in .
"We &apos;ve got to start building cities and human environ@@ ments where a 1@@ 5@@ 0-@@ po@@ u@@ nd person can go a couple of miles in a den@@ se , ri@@ ch , gre@@ en@@ -@@ space environment , without being in a 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ po@@ u@@ nd mach@@ ine to do it ."
"C@@ ars were not me@@ ant for par@@ al@@ le@@ l par@@ king ; they &apos;re wonderful mach@@ ines to go between cities , but just think about it : we &apos;ve sol@@ ved all the lon@@ g@@ -@@ r@@ ange , high-@@ speed problems ."
The Gre@@ e@@ ks went from the the@@ ater of D@@ i@@ on@@ y@@ su@@ s to the Par@@ th@@ en@@ on in their s@@ and@@ als .
You do it in your s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers .
N@@ ot much has changed .
If this thing goes only three times as f@@ ast as wal@@ king — three times — a 3@@ 0-@@ minu@@ te walk be@@ comes 10 minutes .
"@@ Y@@ our cho@@ ice , when living in a city , if it &apos;s now 10 minutes — because at 30 minutes you want an alter@@ n@@ ative , whether it &apos;s a bu@@ s , a tra@@ in — we &apos;ve got to build an in@@ fra@@ structure — a light ra@@ il — or you &apos;re going to keep par@@ king those cars ."
"But if you could put a p@@ in in most cities , and imagine how far you could , if you had the time , walk in one hal@@ f-@@ hour , it &apos;s the city ."
"If you could make it fun , and make it eight or 10 minutes , you can &apos;t find your car , un@@ -@@ par@@ k your car , move your car , re@@ -@@ par@@ k your car and go some@@ where ; you can &apos;t get to a ca@@ b or a sub@@ way ."
"We could change the way people al@@ lo@@ cate their re@@ sources , the way this planet uses its energy , make it more fun ."
And we &apos;re hop@@ ing to some ex@@ t@@ ent history will say we were right .
That &apos;s Se@@ g@@ way . This is a S@@ ti@@ r@@ ling cy@@ cle eng@@ ine ; this had been con@@ f@@ used by a lot of things we &apos;re doing .

"So , about three years ago I was in Lon@@ don , and somebody called H@@ ow@@ ard Bu@@ r@@ ton came to me and said , I re@@ present a group of people , and we want to start an institu@@ te in the@@ ore@@ tical physi@@ cs ."
"We have about 1@@ 20 million dollars , and we want to do it well ."
"We want to be in the fore@@ front fie@@ l@@ ds , and we want to do it differ@@ ently ."
"We want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas , and the old people have all the power and deci@@ de what science gets done ."
It took me about 25 secon@@ ds to deci@@ de that that was a good idea .
"Th@@ ree years later , we have the P@@ eri@@ me@@ ter In@@ stitu@@ te for Th@@ e@@ ore@@ tical P@@ h@@ ysi@@ cs in W@@ at@@ er@@ lo@@ o , O@@ n@@ t@@ ari@@ o . It ’ s the most exci@@ ting job I ’ ve ever had ."
And it ’ s the first time I ’ ve had a job where I ’ m af@@ ra@@ id to go away because of everything that ’ s going to happen in this week when I ’ m here .
"( Laughter ) But in any case , what I ’ m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a qui@@ ck t@@ our of some of the things that we talk about and we think about ."
"So , we think a lot about what really makes science work ?"
"The first thing that any@@ body who know@@ s science , and has been around science , is that the stuff you learn in school as a scienti@@ fic meth@@ od is wrong . There is no meth@@ od ."
"O@@ n the other hand , some@@ how we man@@ age to reason together as a community , from in@@ comple@@ te evi@@ dence to con@@ clu@@ sions that we all ag@@ ree about ."
"And this is , by the way , something that a de@@ moc@@ r@@ atic society also has to do ."
So how does it work ?
"Well , my belie@@ f is that it works because scienti@@ sts are a community b@@ ound together by an e@@ thi@@ cs ."
And here are some of the e@@ thi@@ cal prin@@ ci@@ ples .
I ’ m not going to read them all to you because I ’ m not in teach@@ er mo@@ de .
"I ’ m in en@@ ter@@ tain , am@@ a@@ ze mo@@ de ."
( Laughter ) But one of the prin@@ ci@@ ples is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fi@@ ght and ar@@ gu@@ e as hard as they can for what they believe .
"But we ’ re all dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ined by the under@@ standing that the only people who are going to deci@@ de , you know , whether I ’ m right or somebody else is right , are the people in our community in the next gener@@ ation , in 30 and 50 years ."
"So it ’ s this com@@ bin@@ ation of re@@ spe@@ ct for the tra@@ di@@ tion and community we ’ re in , and re@@ be@@ llion that the community requi@@ res to get any@@ where , that makes science work ."
"And being in this process of being in a community that reas@@ ons from sh@@ ared evi@@ dence to con@@ clu@@ sions , I believe , teach@@ es us about de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y ."
"N@@ ot only is there a relation@@ ship between the e@@ thi@@ cs of science and the e@@ thi@@ cs of being a ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en in de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y , but there has been , histori@@ cally , a relation@@ ship between how people think about space and time , and what the co@@ smo@@ s is , and how people think about the society that they live in ."
And I want to talk about three st@@ ages in that ev@@ olution .
"The first science of co@@ smo@@ logy that was anything like science was A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ e@@ li@@ an science , and that was h@@ ier@@ archi@@ cal ."
"The ear@@ th is in the cen@@ ter , then there are these c@@ r@@ yst@@ al sp@@ her@@ es , the su@@ n , the mo@@ on , the plane@@ ts and finally the ce@@ le@@ sti@@ al sp@@ here , where the star@@ s are . And everything in this universe has a place ."
"And A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le ’ s la@@ w of moti@@ on was that everything goes to its natural place , which was of course , the ru@@ le of the society that A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le li@@ ved in , and more import@@ an@@ tly , the me@@ d@@ ie@@ v@@ al society that , through Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ani@@ ty , em@@ brac@@ ed A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le and bl@@ ess@@ ed it ."
And the idea is that everything is de@@ fin@@ ed .
"W@@ here something is , is de@@ fin@@ ed with re@@ spe@@ ct to this last sp@@ here , the ce@@ le@@ sti@@ al sp@@ here , outside of which is this e@@ ter@@ na@@ l , perfe@@ ct re@@ al@@ m , where lives God , who is the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate ju@@ dge of everything ."
"So that is both A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ e@@ li@@ an co@@ smo@@ logy , and in a certain sense , me@@ d@@ ie@@ v@@ al society ."
"Now , in the 1@@ 7@@ th century there was a re@@ v@@ olution in thinking about space and time and moti@@ on and so for@@ th of N@@ ew@@ ton ."
And at the same time there was a re@@ v@@ olution in social thought of Joh@@ n L@@ oc@@ ke and his col@@ labor@@ at@@ ors .
And they were very clo@@ se@@ ly as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated .
"In fact , N@@ ew@@ ton and L@@ oc@@ ke were friends ."
"Th@@ e@@ ir way of thinking about space and time and moti@@ on on the one hand , and a society on the other hand , were clo@@ se@@ ly re@@ lated ."
And let me show you .
"In a N@@ ew@@ t@@ oni@@ an universe , there ’ s no cen@@ ter — th@@ ank you ."
"There are parti@@ cles and they move around with re@@ spe@@ ct to a fi@@ x@@ ed , absolu@@ te fra@@ me@@ work of space and time ."
"It ’ s me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful to say absolu@@ tely where something is in space , because that ’ s de@@ fin@@ ed , not with re@@ spe@@ ct to say , where other things are , but with re@@ spe@@ ct to this absolu@@ te noti@@ on of space , which for N@@ ew@@ ton was God ."
"Now , si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ly , in L@@ oc@@ ke ’ s society there are individu@@ als who have certain ri@@ ghts , pro@@ per@@ ties in a form@@ al sense , and those are de@@ fin@@ ed with re@@ spe@@ ct to some absolu@@ te , ab@@ strac@@ t noti@@ ons of ri@@ ghts and ju@@ sti@@ ce , and so for@@ th , which are in@@ depen@@ dent of what else has happened in the society ."
"O@@ f who else there is , of the history and so for@@ th ."
"There is also an om@@ ni@@ scien@@ t obser@@ ver who know@@ s everything , who is God , who is in a certain sense outside the universe , because he has no ro@@ le in anything that happens , but is in a certain sense every@@ where , because space is just the way that God know@@ s where everything is , ac@@ cor@@ ding to N@@ ew@@ ton , OK ?"
"So this is the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ations of what ’ s called , tra@@ di@@ tion@@ ally , li@@ ber@@ al poli@@ tical the@@ ory and N@@ ew@@ t@@ oni@@ an physi@@ cs ."
"Now , in the 20@@ th century we had a re@@ v@@ olution that was ini@@ ti@@ ated at the beginning of the 20@@ th century , and which is still going on ."
It was be@@ gu@@ n with the inv@@ en@@ tion of relati@@ vity the@@ ory and qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m the@@ ory .
"And mer@@ g@@ ing them together to make the fin@@ al qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m the@@ ory of space and time and gra@@ vity , is the cul@@ min@@ ation of that , something that ’ s going on right now ."
"And in this universe there ’ s nothing fi@@ x@@ ed and absolu@@ te . Z@@ il@@ ch , OK ."
This universe is descri@@ bed by being a network of relation@@ ships .
"S@@ p@@ ace is just one aspe@@ ct , so there ’ s no me@@ an@@ ing to say absolu@@ tely where something is ."
There ’ s only where it is rel@@ ative to everything else that is .
And this network of rel@@ ations is e@@ ver@@ -@@ ev@@ ol@@ ving .
So we call it a rel@@ ational universe .
All pro@@ per@@ ties of things are about these kinds of relation@@ ships .
"And also , if you ’ re em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in such a network of relation@@ ships , your view of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of rel@@ ations ."
And there ’ s no place for an om@@ ni@@ scien@@ t obser@@ ver or an outside inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence know@@ ing everything and making everything .
"So this is gener@@ al relati@@ vity , this is qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m the@@ ory ."
"This is also , if you talk to leg@@ al sch@@ ol@@ ars , the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ations of new ideas in leg@@ al thought ."
They ’ re thinking about the same things .
"And not only that , they make the an@@ al@@ og@@ y to relati@@ vity the@@ ory and co@@ smo@@ logy often ."
So there ’ s an interesting di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion going on there .
This last view of co@@ smo@@ logy is called the rel@@ ational view .
"So the ma@@ in s@@ log@@ an here is that there ’ s nothing outside the universe , which means that there ’ s no place to put an ex@@ plan@@ ation for something outside ."
"So in such a rel@@ ational universe , if you come upo@@ n something that ’ s or@@ der@@ ed and stru@@ ctu@@ red , like this de@@ vice here , or that de@@ vice there , or something beautiful , like all the living things , all of you guys in the room — &quot; &quot; guys &quot; &quot; in physi@@ cs , by the way , is a gen@@ eri@@ c ter@@ m : men and women ."
"( Laughter ) Th@@ en you want to know , you ’ re a person , you want to know how is it made ."
"And in a rel@@ ational universe the only possible ex@@ plan@@ ation was , some@@ how it made itself ."
There must be mechani@@ s@@ ms of self-@@ organiz@@ ation inside the universe that make things .
"Because there ’ s no place to put a mak@@ er outside , as there was in the A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ e@@ li@@ an and the N@@ ew@@ t@@ oni@@ an universe ."
So in a rel@@ ational universe we must have pro@@ cess@@ es of self-@@ organiz@@ ation .
"Now , D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n t@@ au@@ ght us that there are pro@@ cess@@ es of self-@@ organiz@@ ation that su@@ f@@ fi@@ ce to expla@@ in all of us and everything we see ."
"So it works . But not only that , if you think about how natural se@@ le@@ ction works , then it turns out that natural se@@ le@@ ction would only make sense in such a rel@@ ational universe ."
"That is , natural se@@ le@@ ction works on pro@@ per@@ ties , like fi@@ t@@ ness , which are about relation@@ ships of some species to some other species ."
"D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n wouldn ’ t make sense in an A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ e@@ li@@ an universe , and wouldn ’ t really make sense in a N@@ ew@@ t@@ oni@@ an universe ."
So a the@@ ory of bio@@ logy based on natural se@@ le@@ ction requi@@ res a rel@@ ational noti@@ on of what are the pro@@ per@@ ties of biologi@@ cal systems .
"And if you p@@ us@@ h that all the way down , really , it makes the best sense in a rel@@ ational universe where all pro@@ per@@ ties are rel@@ ational ."
"Now , not only that , but E@@ inste@@ in t@@ au@@ ght us that gra@@ vity is the resul@@ t of the world being rel@@ ational ."
"If it wasn ’ t for gra@@ vity , there wouldn ’ t be life , because gra@@ vity ca@@ uses star@@ s to form and live for a very long time , ke@@ e@@ ping pie@@ ces of the world , like the surface of the Earth , out of ther@@ mal e@@ qui@@ li@@ bri@@ um for bi@@ llions of years so life can ev@@ ol@@ ve ."
"In the 20@@ th century , we saw the in@@ depen@@ dent develo@@ pment of two big the@@ mes in science ."
"In the biologi@@ cal scien@@ ces , they ex@@ plo@@ red the im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations of the noti@@ on that order and comple@@ x@@ ity and structure ari@@ se in a self-@@ organiz@@ ed way ."
That was the tri@@ um@@ ph of Ne@@ o@@ -@@ D@@ ar@@ win@@ is@@ m and so for@@ th .
"And s@@ low@@ ly , that idea is le@@ aking out to the cogni@@ tive scien@@ ces , the human scien@@ ces , econ@@ omi@@ cs , et ce@@ ter@@ a ."
"A@@ t the same time , we physi@@ ci@@ sts have been bus@@ y trying to make sense of and build on and inte@@ gr@@ ate the disco@@ ver@@ ies of qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m the@@ ory and relati@@ vity ."
"And what we ’ ve been working out is the im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations , really , of the idea that the universe is made up of rel@@ ations ."
"@@ 2@@ 1@@ st@@ -@@ century science is going to be dri@@ ven by the inte@@ gr@@ ation of these two ideas : the tri@@ um@@ ph of rel@@ ational ways of thinking about the world , on the one hand , and self-@@ organiz@@ ation or D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ an ways of thinking about the world , on the other hand ."
"And also , is that in the 2@@ 1@@ st century our thinking about space and time and co@@ smo@@ logy , and our thinking about society are both going to contin@@ ue to ev@@ ol@@ ve ."
"And what they ’ re ev@@ ol@@ ving towar@@ ds is the uni@@ on of these two big ideas , D@@ ar@@ win@@ is@@ m and relation@@ ali@@ sm ."
"Now , if you think about de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y from this perspe@@ ctive , a new p@@ lu@@ r@@ ali@@ stic noti@@ on of de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y would be one that re@@ cogni@@ z@@ es that there are many different interest@@ s , many different ag@@ en@@ d@@ as , many different individu@@ als , many different poin@@ ts of view ."
"E@@ ach one is in@@ comple@@ te , because you ’ re em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in a network of relation@@ ships ."
A@@ ny ac@@ tor in a de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y is em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in a network of relation@@ ships .
"And you understand some things better than other things , and because of that there ’ s a contin@@ u@@ al j@@ ost@@ ling and give and take , which is poli@@ ti@@ cs ."
"And poli@@ ti@@ cs is , in the ide@@ al sense , the way in which we contin@@ u@@ ally ad@@ dre@@ ss our network of rel@@ ations in order to ach@@ ie@@ ve a better life and a better society ."
And I also think that science will never go away and — I ’ m fini@@ sh@@ ing on this line .
"( Laughter ) In fact , I ’ m fini@@ shed . S@@ cien@@ ce will never go away ."
"We live in difficult and challen@@ g@@ ing economic times , of course ."
"And one of the first vi@@ cti@@ ms of difficult economic times , I think , is public sp@@ ending of any kind , but cer@@ tain@@ ly in the fir@@ ing line at the moment is public sp@@ ending for science , and parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly cu@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty@@ -@@ led science and expl@@ or@@ ation ."
So I want to try and con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you in about 15 minutes that that &apos;s a ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous and lu@@ di@@ c@@ rou@@ s thing to do .
"But I think to set the scen@@ e , I want to show — the next sli@@ de is not my at@@ tem@@ pt to show the wor@@ st TED sli@@ de in the history of TED , but it is a bit of a m@@ ess ."
"( Laughter ) But actually , it &apos;s not my f@@ au@@ l@@ t ; it &apos;s from the G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er ."
And it &apos;s actually a beautiful de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of how much science co@@ sts .
"Because , if I &apos;m going to make the case for contin@@ u@@ ing to spend on cu@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty@@ -@@ dri@@ ven science and expl@@ or@@ ation , I should tell you how much it co@@ sts ."
So this is a g@@ ame called &quot; &quot; spo@@ t the science bud@@ gets . &quot; &quot; This is the U.@@ K@@ . government spend .
"You see there , it &apos;s about 6@@ 20 billion a year ."
"The science bud@@ get is actually — if you look to your left , there &apos;s a pur@@ ple set of blo@@ b@@ s and then y@@ el@@ low set of blo@@ b@@ s ."
And it &apos;s one of the y@@ el@@ low set of blo@@ b@@ s around the big y@@ el@@ low blo@@ b .
It &apos;s about 3@@ .@@ 3 billion po@@ un@@ ds per year out of 6@@ 20 billion .
That fun@@ ds everything in the U.@@ K@@ .
"@@ from medi@@ cal research , space expl@@ or@@ ation , where I work , at C@@ E@@ R@@ N in G@@ en@@ ev@@ a , parti@@ cle physi@@ cs , engine@@ ering , even ar@@ ts and hum@@ ani@@ ties , fun@@ ded from the science bud@@ get , which is that 3@@ .@@ 3 billion , that little , t@@ iny y@@ el@@ low blo@@ b around the or@@ ange blo@@ b at the top left of the scre@@ en ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re ar@@ gu@@ ing about .
"That per@@ cent@@ age , by the way , is about the same in the U.@@ S. and G@@ er@@ many and Fran@@ ce ."
"@@ R &a@@ m@@ p@@ ; D in tot@@ al in the econom@@ y , publi@@ c@@ ly fun@@ ded , is about 0@@ .@@ 6 percent of G@@ D@@ P ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re ar@@ gu@@ ing about .
"The first thing I want to say , and this is stra@@ ight from &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ yst@@ em , &quot; &quot; is that our expl@@ or@@ ation of the solar system and the universe has sh@@ own us that it is in@@ descri@@ b@@ ably beautiful ."
"This is a picture that actually was s@@ ent back by the C@@ as@@ sin@@ i space pro@@ be around S@@ atur@@ n , after we &apos;d fini@@ shed fil@@ ming &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ yst@@ em . &quot; &quot; So it isn &apos;t in the ser@@ ies ."
It &apos;s of the mo@@ on En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
"So that big s@@ wee@@ ping , white sp@@ here in the cor@@ ner is S@@ atur@@ n , which is actually in the back@@ ground of the picture ."
"And that cre@@ sc@@ ent there is the mo@@ on En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , which is about as big as the Bri@@ ti@@ sh Is@@ les ."
It &apos;s about 500 kilome@@ ters in di@@ am@@ e@@ ter .
"So , t@@ iny mo@@ on ."
What &apos;s fas@@ cin@@ ating and beautiful ...
"@@ this an un@@ pro@@ cess@@ ed picture , by the way , I should say , it &apos;s black and white , stra@@ ight from S@@ atur@@ ni@@ an or@@ bit ."
"What &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the lim@@ b there some fa@@ int , sort of , wi@@ sp@@ s of almost smo@@ ke ri@@ sing up from the lim@@ b ."
This is how we vi@@ su@@ ali@@ ze that in &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ yst@@ em . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful gra@@ phi@@ c .
What we found out were that those fa@@ int wi@@ sp@@ s are actually f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of ice ri@@ sing up from the surface of this t@@ iny mo@@ on .
"That &apos;s fas@@ cin@@ ating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the mechani@@ sm for power@@ ing those f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins requi@@ res there to be l@@ ak@@ es of li@@ qu@@ id water b@@ ene@@ ath the surface of this mo@@ on ."
"And what &apos;s important about that is that , on our planet , on Earth , wh@@ er@@ ever we find li@@ qu@@ id water , we find life ."
"So , to find stron@@ g evi@@ dence of li@@ qu@@ id , po@@ ols of li@@ qu@@ id , b@@ ene@@ ath the surface of a mo@@ on 7@@ 50 million miles away from the Earth is really quite ast@@ oun@@ ding ."
"So what we &apos;re saying , essen@@ ti@@ ally , is maybe that &apos;s a ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at for life in the solar system ."
"Well , let me just say , that was a gra@@ phi@@ c . I just want to show this picture ."
That &apos;s one more picture of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
This is when C@@ as@@ sin@@ i f@@ le@@ w b@@ ene@@ ath En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
"So it made a very low pas@@ s , just a few hundre@@ d kilome@@ ters ab@@ o@@ ve the surface ."
"And so this , again , a real picture of the ice f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ri@@ sing up into space , absolu@@ tely beautiful ."
But that &apos;s not the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ d@@ ate for life in the solar system .
"That &apos;s probably this place , which is a mo@@ on of Ju@@ pi@@ ter , Europ@@ a ."
"And again , we had to f@@ ly to the Jo@@ vi@@ an system to get any sense that this mo@@ on , as most mo@@ ons , was anything other than a de@@ ad ball of ro@@ ck ."
It &apos;s actually an ice mo@@ on .
"So what you &apos;re looking at is the surface of the mo@@ on Europ@@ a , which is a thi@@ ck sh@@ e@@ et of ice , probably a hundre@@ d kilome@@ ters thi@@ ck ."
"But by meas@@ ur@@ ing the way that Europ@@ a inter@@ ac@@ ts with the mag@@ ne@@ tic fie@@ ld of Ju@@ pi@@ ter , and looking at how those c@@ rac@@ ks in the ice that you can see there on that gra@@ phi@@ c move around , we &apos;ve in@@ fer@@ red very stron@@ g@@ ly that there &apos;s an ocean of li@@ qu@@ id sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding the entire surface of Europ@@ a ."
"So be@@ low the ice , there &apos;s an ocean of li@@ qu@@ id around the whole mo@@ on ."
"It could be hundre@@ ds of kilome@@ ters de@@ ep , we think ."
"We think it &apos;s s@@ al@@ tw@@ ater , and that would mean that there &apos;s more water on that mo@@ on of Ju@@ pi@@ ter than there is in all the oce@@ ans of the Earth com@@ b@@ ined ."
"So that place , a little mo@@ on around Ju@@ pi@@ ter , is probably the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ d@@ ate for fin@@ ding life on a mo@@ on or a body outside the Earth , that we know of ."
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous and beautiful disco@@ very .
O@@ ur expl@@ or@@ ation of the solar system has t@@ au@@ ght us that the solar system is beautiful .
"It may also have poin@@ ted the way to ans@@ wer@@ ing one of the most pro@@ found questions that you can possi@@ bly ask , which is : &quot; &quot; A@@ re we alone in the universe ? &quot; &quot; Is there any other use to expl@@ or@@ ation and science , other than just a sense of won@@ der ?"
"Well , there is ."
"This is a very fam@@ ous picture taken , actually , on my first Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as E@@ ve , De@@ c@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 4@@ th , 19@@ 6@@ 8 , when I was about eight months old ."
It was taken by A@@ pol@@ l@@ o 8 as it went around the back of the mo@@ on .
Ear@@ th@@ ri@@ se from A@@ pol@@ l@@ o 8 .
"A fam@@ ous picture ; many people have said that it &apos;s the picture that sa@@ ved 19@@ 6@@ 8 , which was a tur@@ bu@@ l@@ ent year — the stud@@ ent ri@@ ots in Par@@ is , the he@@ ight of the V@@ ie@@ t@@ nam W@@ ar ."
"The reason many people think that about this picture , and A@@ l G@@ ore has said it many times , actually , on the st@@ age at TED , is that this picture , ar@@ gu@@ ably , was the beginning of the environ@@ ment@@ al movement ."
"Because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a so@@ li@@ d , im@@ mov@@ able , kind of in@@ de@@ stru@@ cti@@ ble place , but as a very small , fra@@ gi@@ le@@ -@@ looking world just h@@ ang@@ ing against the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ ness of space ."
"What &apos;s also not often said about the space expl@@ or@@ ation , about the A@@ pol@@ l@@ o program , is the economic con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion it made ."
"I mean while you can make ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents that it was wonderful and a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous ach@@ ie@@ v@@ ement and deli@@ vered pi@@ ctures like this , it cost a lot , didn &apos;t it ?"
"Well , actually , many stud@@ ies have been done about the economic effe@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess , the economic impac@@ t of A@@ pol@@ l@@ o ."
The bi@@ ggest one was in 19@@ 7@@ 5 by C@@ ha@@ se E@@ con@@ ome@@ tri@@ cs .
"And it show@@ ed that for every $ 1 spent on A@@ pol@@ l@@ o , 14 came back into the U.@@ S. econom@@ y ."
"So the A@@ pol@@ l@@ o program pa@@ id for itself in in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation , in engine@@ ering , ach@@ ie@@ v@@ ement and , I think , in in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing young scienti@@ sts and engine@@ ers 14 times over ."
So expl@@ or@@ ation can pay for itself .
What about scienti@@ fic disco@@ very ?
What about dri@@ ving in@@ no@@ vation ?
"Well , this looks like a picture of vi@@ r@@ tually nothing ."
"What it is , is a picture of the spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en ."
"S@@ e@@ e , back in the 1@@ 8@@ 8@@ 0s , 1@@ 8@@ 9@@ 0s , many scienti@@ sts , many obser@@ ver@@ s , looked at the light given off from at@@ oms ."
And they saw str@@ ange pi@@ ctures like this .
"What you &apos;re seeing when you put it through a pri@@ sm is that you he@@ at hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en up and it doesn &apos;t just g@@ low like a white light , it just e@@ mi@@ ts light at particular col@@ ors , a red one , a light blue one , some dar@@ k blue ones ."
Now that led to an under@@ standing of at@@ om@@ ic structure because the way that &apos;s expla@@ ined is at@@ oms are a single nu@@ cle@@ us with ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ns going around them .
And the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ns can only be in particular places .
"And when they j@@ um@@ p up to the next place they can be , and f@@ all back down again , they em@@ it light at particular col@@ ors ."
"And so the fact that at@@ oms , when you he@@ at them up , only em@@ it light at very speci@@ fic col@@ ors , was one of the key dri@@ ver@@ s that led to the develo@@ pment of the qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m the@@ ory , the the@@ ory of the structure of at@@ oms ."
I just wanted to show this picture because this is re@@ mark@@ able .
This is actually a picture of the spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of the Su@@ n .
"And now , this is a picture of at@@ oms in the Su@@ n &apos;s atmo@@ sp@@ here ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing light ."
"And again , they only ab@@ sor@@ b light at particular col@@ ors when ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ns j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down , j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down ."
But look at the number of black lin@@ es in that spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m .
And the ele@@ ment he@@ li@@ um was disco@@ vered just by star@@ ing at the light from the Su@@ n because some of those black lin@@ es were found that cor@@ respon@@ ded to no known ele@@ ment .
And that &apos;s why he@@ li@@ um &apos;s called he@@ li@@ um .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; he@@ li@@ os &quot; &quot; — he@@ li@@ os from the Su@@ n .
"Now , that sounds es@@ ot@@ eri@@ c , and in@@ de@@ ed it was an es@@ ot@@ eri@@ c pur@@ su@@ it , but the qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m the@@ ory quickly led to an under@@ standing of the behavi@@ ors of ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ns in materi@@ als like si@@ lic@@ on , for example ."
"The way that si@@ lic@@ on beha@@ ves , the fact that you can build tran@@ si@@ stor@@ s , is a pu@@ re@@ ly qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on ."
"So without that cu@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty@@ -@@ dri@@ ven under@@ standing of the structure of at@@ oms , which led to this rather es@@ ot@@ eri@@ c the@@ ory , qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m mechani@@ cs , then we wouldn &apos;t have tran@@ si@@ stor@@ s , we wouldn &apos;t have si@@ lic@@ on chi@@ ps , we wouldn &apos;t have pretty much the basi@@ s of our moder@@ n econom@@ y ."
"There &apos;s one more , I think , wonderful t@@ wi@@ st to that t@@ ale ."
"In &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ yst@@ em , &quot; &quot; we ke@@ pt em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ z@@ ing the l@@ aw@@ s of physi@@ cs are uni@@ vers@@ al ."
"It &apos;s one of the most incredible things about the physi@@ cs and the under@@ standing of nature that you get on Earth , is you can transpor@@ t it , not only to the plane@@ ts , but to the most di@@ st@@ ant star@@ s and gal@@ ax@@ ies ."
"And one of the ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing pre@@ di@@ ctions of qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m mechani@@ cs , just by looking at the structure of at@@ oms — the same the@@ ory that descri@@ be@@ s tran@@ si@@ stor@@ s — is that there can be no star@@ s in the universe that have re@@ ach@@ ed the end of their life that are bi@@ g@@ ger than , quite speci@@ fi@@ cally , 1@@ .@@ 4 times the mas@@ s of the Su@@ n ."
That &apos;s a lim@@ it im@@ posed on the mas@@ s of star@@ s .
"You can work it out on a piece of pa@@ per in a labor@@ at@@ ory , get a tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e , s@@ w@@ ing it to the sk@@ y , and you find that there are no de@@ ad star@@ s bi@@ g@@ ger than 1@@ .@@ 4 times the mas@@ s of the Su@@ n ."
That &apos;s quite an incredible pre@@ di@@ ction .
What happens when you have a st@@ ar that &apos;s right on the ed@@ ge of that mas@@ s ?
"Well , this is a picture of it ."
"This is the picture of a gal@@ ax@@ y , a common &quot; &quot; our gar@@ den &quot; &quot; gal@@ ax@@ y with , what , 100 billion star@@ s like our Su@@ n in it ."
It &apos;s just one of bi@@ llions of gal@@ ax@@ ies in the universe .
"There are a billion star@@ s in the gal@@ ac@@ tic cor@@ e , which is why it &apos;s sh@@ ining out so bri@@ gh@@ tly ."
"This is about 50 million light years away , so one of our neigh@@ bor@@ ing gal@@ ax@@ ies ."
But that b@@ right st@@ ar there is actually one of the star@@ s in the gal@@ ax@@ y .
So that st@@ ar is also 50 million light years away .
"It &apos;s part of that gal@@ ax@@ y , and it &apos;s sh@@ ining as bri@@ gh@@ tly as the cen@@ ter of the gal@@ ax@@ y with a billion su@@ ns in it ."
That &apos;s a Ty@@ pe I@@ a super@@ no@@ v@@ a ex@@ plo@@ sion .
"Now that &apos;s an incredible ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a , because it &apos;s a st@@ ar that si@@ ts there ."
It &apos;s called a car@@ b@@ on-@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f .
"It si@@ ts there about , say , 1@@ .@@ 3 times the mas@@ s of the Su@@ n ."
"And it has a bin@@ ary comp@@ ani@@ on that goes around it , so a big st@@ ar , a big ball of gas ."
"And what it does is it su@@ cks gas off its comp@@ ani@@ on st@@ ar , until it gets to this lim@@ it called the Ch@@ and@@ ra@@ sek@@ ha@@ r lim@@ it , and then it ex@@ plo@@ des ."
"And it ex@@ plo@@ des , and it sh@@ ines as bri@@ gh@@ tly as a billion su@@ ns for about two weeks , and rele@@ ases , not only energy , but a huge amount of chemi@@ cal ele@@ ments into the universe ."
"In fact , that one is a car@@ b@@ on-@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f ."
"Now , there was no car@@ b@@ on and o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en in the universe at the Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g ."
And there was no car@@ b@@ on and o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en in the universe throu@@ gh@@ out the first gener@@ ation of star@@ s .
"It was made in star@@ s like that , lo@@ cked away and then re@@ turned to the universe in ex@@ plo@@ sions like that in order to re@@ con@@ den@@ se into plane@@ ts , star@@ s , new solar systems and , in@@ de@@ ed , people like us ."
"I think that &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ able de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the power and beau@@ ty and uni@@ vers@@ ality of the l@@ aw@@ s of physi@@ cs , because we understand that process , because we understand the structure of at@@ oms here on Earth ."
"This is a beautiful quot@@ e that I found — we &apos;re talking about ser@@ en@@ di@@ pi@@ ty there — from A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der F@@ le@@ ming : &quot; &quot; When I wo@@ ke up just after daw@@ n on Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 2@@ 8 , 19@@ 2@@ 8 , I cer@@ tain@@ ly didn &apos;t pl@@ an to re@@ v@@ olu@@ ti@@ oni@@ ze all medi@@ cine by disco@@ ver@@ ing the world &apos;s first anti@@ bi@@ oti@@ c . &quot; &quot; Now , the expl@@ or@@ ers of the world of the at@@ om did not inten@@ d to inv@@ ent the tran@@ si@@ st@@ or ."
"And they cer@@ tain@@ ly didn &apos;t inten@@ d to descri@@ be the mechani@@ cs of super@@ no@@ v@@ a ex@@ plo@@ sions , which ev@@ en@@ tually told us where the building blo@@ cks of life were syn@@ the@@ si@@ zed in the universe ."
"So , I think science can be — ser@@ en@@ di@@ pi@@ ty is important ."
It can be beautiful . It can re@@ ve@@ al quite ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing things .
"It can also , I think , finally re@@ ve@@ al the most pro@@ found ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the val@@ ue of our home planet ."
This is a spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar picture of our home planet .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet ."
"It looks like S@@ atur@@ n because , of course , it is ."
It was taken by the C@@ as@@ sin@@ i space pro@@ be .
"But it &apos;s a fam@@ ous picture , not because of the beau@@ ty and ma@@ je@@ sty of S@@ atur@@ n &apos;s r@@ ings , but actually because of a t@@ iny , fa@@ int blo@@ b just h@@ ang@@ ing under@@ ne@@ ath one of the r@@ ings ."
"And if I b@@ low it up there , you see it ."
"It looks like a mo@@ on , but in fact , it &apos;s a picture of Earth ."
It was a picture of Earth cap@@ tu@@ red in that fra@@ me of S@@ atur@@ n .
That &apos;s our planet from 7@@ 50 million miles away .
"I think the Earth has got a str@@ ange pro@@ per@@ ty that the far@@ ther away you get from it , the more beautiful it seem@@ s ."
But that is not the most di@@ st@@ ant or most fam@@ ous picture of our planet .
"It was taken by this thing , which is called the V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er sp@@ ace@@ c@@ ra@@ ft ."
And that &apos;s a picture of me in front of it for scale .
The V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er is a t@@ iny mach@@ ine .
"It &apos;s cur@@ r@@ ently 10 billion miles away from Earth , trans@@ mi@@ tting with that di@@ sh , with the power of 20 wat@@ ts , and we &apos;re still in cont@@ act with it ."
"But it visi@@ ted Ju@@ pi@@ ter , S@@ atur@@ n , U@@ ran@@ us and Ne@@ p@@ tu@@ ne ."
"And after it visi@@ ted all four of those plane@@ ts , C@@ ar@@ l S@@ ag@@ an , who &apos;s one of my great her@@ o@@ es , had the wonderful idea of tur@@ ning V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er around and taking a picture of every planet it had visi@@ ted ."
And it took this picture of Earth .
"Now it &apos;s very hard to see the Earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; P@@ ale B@@ lu@@ e D@@ ot &quot; &quot; picture , but Earth is s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded in that red sha@@ ft of light ."
That &apos;s Earth from four billion miles away .
"And I &apos;d like to read you what S@@ ag@@ an wro@@ te about it , just to fin@@ is@@ h , because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to descri@@ be what he saw in that picture that he had taken ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Con@@ si@@ der again that do@@ t ."
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
"O@@ n it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was li@@ ved out their lives ."
"The ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ates of jo@@ y and su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing thousands of con@@ fi@@ dent religi@@ ons , ide@@ o@@ log@@ ies and economic do@@ c@@ tr@@ ines , every hun@@ ter and for@@ ag@@ er , every her@@ o and c@@ ow@@ ard , every cre@@ ator and de@@ stro@@ y@@ er of ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , every king and pe@@ as@@ ant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , hop@@ e@@ ful child , inv@@ ent@@ or and ex@@ plo@@ re@@ r , every teach@@ er of mor@@ als , every cor@@ ru@@ pt poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an , every super@@ st@@ ar , every su@@ pre@@ me lea@@ der , every sa@@ int and sin@@ ner in the history of our species , li@@ ved there , on a mot@@ e of d@@ ust , s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded in a su@@ n@@ be@@ am ."
It &apos;s been said that ast@@ ron@@ om@@ y &apos;s a hum@@ b@@ ling and char@@ ac@@ ter@@ -@@ building experience .
There is per@@ haps no better de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the fol@@ ly of human con@@ ce@@ its than this di@@ st@@ ant image of our t@@ iny world .
"To me , it under@@ s@@ co@@ res our respon@@ si@@ bility to deal more kin@@ d@@ ly with one another and to pre@@ ser@@ ve and ch@@ eri@@ sh the p@@ ale blue do@@ t , the only home we &apos;ve ever known . &quot; &quot; Be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful words about the power of science and expl@@ or@@ ation ."
"The ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent has always been made , and it will always be made , that we know enough about the universe ."
You could have made it in the 19@@ 20@@ s ; you wouldn &apos;t have had p@@ eni@@ ci@@ lli@@ n .
You could have made it in the 1@@ 8@@ 9@@ 0s ; you wouldn &apos;t have the tran@@ si@@ st@@ or .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
"S@@ u@@ re@@ ly , we know enough ."
We don &apos;t need to disco@@ ver anything else about our universe .
"L@@ et me leave the last words to someone who &apos;s ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly be@@ coming a her@@ o of m@@ ine , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who did his science at the turn of the 19@@ th century ."
He was c@@ lear@@ ly under as@@ sa@@ ul@@ t all the time .
&quot; &quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19@@ th century .
"J@@ ust ex@@ plo@@ it it ; just build things . &quot; &quot; He said this , he said , &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ thing is more f@@ at@@ al to the pro@@ gre@@ ss of the human mind than to pre@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are comple@@ te , that there are no m@@ yst@@ er@@ ies in nature , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."

S@@ ome of the gre@@ at@@ est in@@ no@@ v@@ ations and develo@@ p@@ ments in the world often happen at the inter@@ se@@ ction of two fie@@ l@@ ds .
"So ton@@ ight I &apos;d like to tell you about the inter@@ se@@ ction that I &apos;m most exci@@ ted about at this very moment , which is en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment and rob@@ oti@@ cs ."
"So if we &apos;re trying to make rob@@ ots that can be more ex@@ pres@@ sive and that can conne@@ ct better with us in society , maybe we should look to some of the human prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als of arti@@ fi@@ cial emoti@@ on and per@@ son@@ ality that oc@@ cu@@ r in the dra@@ m@@ atic ar@@ ts ."
I &apos;m also interested in cre@@ ating new technolog@@ ies for the ar@@ ts and to at@@ trac@@ t people to science and technology .
S@@ ome people in the last dec@@ ade or two have started cre@@ ating ar@@ t@@ work with technology .
"Wi@@ th my new ven@@ ture , Mar@@ il@@ y@@ n M@@ on@@ robot , I would like to use art to create te@@ ch ."
( Laughter ) So we &apos;re based in New York C@@ ity .
"And if you &apos;re a perform@@ er that wan@@ ts to col@@ labor@@ ate with an ad@@ or@@ able robot , or if you have a robot that needs en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation , ple@@ ase cont@@ act me , the B@@ ot@@ -@@ A@@ g@@ ent ."

He &apos;s na@@ med after the St@@ ar T@@ re@@ k char@@ ac@@ ter .
I think he &apos;s going to be su@@ per popul@@ ar .
We &apos;ve got the robot — in his head is a d@@ at@@ ab@@ ase of a lot of jo@@ k@@ es .
Now each of these jo@@ k@@ es is la@@ be@@ led with certain at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes .
So it know@@ s something about the sub@@ je@@ ct ; it know@@ s about the len@@ g@@ th .
It know@@ s how much it &apos;s moving .
And so it &apos;s going to try to wat@@ ch your respon@@ se .
I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today .
"( Laughter ) It can also learn from you about the qu@@ ality of its jo@@ k@@ es and cat@@ er things , sort of like N@@ et@@ fli@@ x@@ -@@ sty@@ le , over lon@@ ger@@ -@@ ter@@ m to different communi@@ ties or aud@@ ien@@ ces , children ver@@ su@@ s ad@@ ul@@ ts , different cul@@ tu@@ res ."
You can learn something from the robot about the community that you &apos;re in .
And also I can use each one of you as the ac@@ ting co@@ ach to our future robot comp@@ ani@@ ons .
S@@ ome of you in this mi@@ ddle se@@ ction — you have red / green pad@@ d@@ les .

"If you don &apos;t like the sub@@ je@@ ct or the perform@@ ance , you can h@@ old the red ."
Now don &apos;t be sh@@ y .
It &apos;s just a robot .

There &apos;s also a micro@@ phone that &apos;s list@@ ening to the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate l@@ aughter and ap@@ plause and boo@@ ing — I hope not — to help make some of its next deci@@ sions .

"I am a mar@@ ine to@@ x@@ i@@ co@@ logi@@ st , and I &apos;ve been very , very con@@ cer@@ ned about the G@@ ul@@ f , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly about the mas@@ sive app@@ lic@@ ations of the to@@ x@@ ic disp@@ er@@ s@@ an@@ ts , the C@@ ore@@ x@@ its ."
I &apos;ve been working on ocean pol@@ lu@@ tion for quite a long time — the impac@@ ts on mar@@ ine life and parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly the impac@@ ts on mar@@ ine m@@ am@@ m@@ als .
"As it turns out , mar@@ ine m@@ am@@ m@@ als are at the top of this food cha@@ in that we &apos;re po@@ ur@@ ing mi@@ llions of t@@ ons of to@@ x@@ ic sub@@ stan@@ ces into every year ."
And they are show@@ ing the sig@@ ns of this .
"I &apos;m sor@@ ry to have a sa@@ d sli@@ de like this , but not everything is all that happy , es@@ pe@@ cially in my work ."
"They are lo@@ ad@@ ed with to@@ x@@ ic chemi@@ cal@@ s in their body , hundre@@ ds of com@@ po@@ un@@ ds , all kinds of com@@ po@@ un@@ ds — it &apos;s st@@ ag@@ g@@ ering ."
"And they &apos;re dy@@ ing off rather regu@@ lar@@ ly , ten@@ s of thousands around the world ."
It &apos;s pre@@ di@@ cted they may go ex@@ t@@ in@@ ct — about a third of them — within about 30 years .
So my project is along the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est At@@ lan@@ tic .
It &apos;s called Se@@ als as S@@ ent@@ in@@ els .
"We &apos;re trac@@ king pol@@ lu@@ tion at the top of the food we@@ b , in mar@@ ine m@@ am@@ m@@ als and fish ."
"It &apos;s a regi@@ on-@@ wi@@ de , e@@ co@@ -@@ to@@ x@@ i@@ co@@ logi@@ cal inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ation ."
"We &apos;re looking at a lot of com@@ po@@ un@@ ds , but re@@ cent@@ ly been quite interested in the fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ dan@@ ts , the bro@@ min@@ ated fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ dan@@ ts that are in many , many things that we use in our every@@ day life , from the c@@ us@@ hi@@ ons in the cha@@ ir@@ s we &apos;re all sitting on to the pla@@ stic c@@ as@@ ings of our compu@@ ters , our tele@@ vision se@@ ts and so on ."
"So we are trac@@ king how do these things get from the produ@@ cts into the ocean , which is the fin@@ al sin@@ k for them ."
"And there &apos;s quite a comp@@ lic@@ ated pa@@ th@@ way for that because , as these produ@@ cts age , they get con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated in d@@ ust , and then they also get th@@ row@@ n out , so they go to the land@@ fil@@ ls ."
They wind up in wa@@ ste water tre@@ at@@ ment plan@@ ts .
"As you all know , we th@@ row out bi@@ llions of compu@@ ters and T@@ V@@ s every year ."
And those go to e-@@ wa@@ ste du@@ m@@ ps .
"And all that gets into surface wat@@ ers , ev@@ en@@ tually re@@ ach@@ ing the ocean , the fin@@ al sin@@ k ."
"So , in our study , we did find quite high le@@ v@@ els , as we expe@@ cted , of these fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ dan@@ ts in the har@@ b@@ or se@@ als &apos; bod@@ ies ."
And we re@@ por@@ ted this .
"It led to a b@@ an of this neuro@@ -@@ to@@ x@@ ic fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ d@@ ant called De@@ ca in Ma@@ ine , where I am based , and also then a p@@ ha@@ se@@ -@@ out , U.@@ S@@ .@@ -@@ wi@@ de , at the end of last year ."
"But we said , well , on the b@@ right side , our har@@ b@@ or se@@ als at least will not be bur@@ st@@ ing into fl@@ ame any@@ time so@@ on ."
"So then I got really cu@@ ri@@ ous , myself , as a to@@ x@@ i@@ co@@ logi@@ st , and I d@@ on@@ ated some blo@@ od to my la@@ b and said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , let &apos;s do it . &quot; &quot; Well , we de@@ te@@ cted 1@@ 1@@ 3 different com@@ po@@ un@@ ds in my blo@@ od ."
"And I must say , if any of you would have this done , you &apos;d probably find a si@@ mi@@ lar pro@@ fi@@ le , or co@@ c@@ kt@@ a@@ il , as they call it ."
But I was the re@@ ci@@ pie@@ n@@ t of a lot of fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ d@@ ant materi@@ al for some reason .
And just to point out the le@@ v@@ els — Ameri@@ cans have 10 to 40 times high@@ er le@@ v@@ els of these com@@ po@@ un@@ ds in our bod@@ ies than the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans .
"Wh@@ y ? Because we are fl@@ am@@ e-@@ re@@ tar@@ ding everything , and we have we@@ ak regu@@ l@@ ations for to@@ x@@ ic chemi@@ cal@@ s ."
"But l@@ o and be@@ h@@ old , I &apos;m one of the high-@@ end individu@@ als ."
Lu@@ ck@@ y me .
"But then I thought , well , in case of a fi@@ re , I might be the last one to ig@@ ni@@ te ."
"( Laughter ) So any@@ way , here &apos;s the problem — and it is a problem that we &apos;re looking at in the G@@ ul@@ f today — we &apos;re not regu@@ lat@@ ing chemi@@ cal@@ s in this country pro@@ per@@ ly ."
We &apos;re har@@ d@@ ly regu@@ lat@@ ing them at all .
And we &apos;re le@@ tting indu@@ stry run the show .
"And J@@ ac@@ kie S@@ avi@@ t@@ z spo@@ ke this morning about Bi@@ g O@@ il and the pro@@ p@@ ag@@ an@@ da and how we &apos;re all bra@@ in@@ wa@@ shed with their , you know , l@@ ies and so for@@ th ."
"Well , Bi@@ g Ch@@ e@@ mi@@ cal is what we &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with here ."
"And they &apos;re allow@@ ed to keep tra@@ de se@@ cre@@ ts , so they don &apos;t even give the in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ ts out ."
"P@@ lu@@ s they don &apos;t give health and sa@@ fe@@ ty data , so , con@@ sequ@@ ently , they cannot be regu@@ lated before they go to market ."
So it &apos;s a case of in@@ no@@ cent until pro@@ ven gu@@ il@@ ty .
The bur@@ den of pro@@ of is not on the produ@@ cer .
So I then was in@@ vi@@ ted to go to the G@@ ul@@ f in M@@ ay .
I went down there on a pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ation to look into disp@@ er@@ s@@ an@@ ts and how they &apos;re going into the water col@@ um@@ n and so for@@ th .
"And I was told that I was the only to@@ x@@ i@@ co@@ logi@@ st to d@@ ate who was du@@ m@@ b enough to get into the water , but I did ."
And we do@@ ve in the sli@@ ck without even H@@ az@@ M@@ at ge@@ ar .
And I did get si@@ ck .
I got a fer@@ o@@ ci@@ ous sor@@ e th@@ ro@@ at two days later .
I felt like my th@@ ro@@ at was on fi@@ re .
But it did pas@@ s .
"And what I did see in the water as we went down , what really sh@@ oc@@ ked me — and it &apos;s ha@@ un@@ ted me ever since — because I could see the dro@@ ple@@ ts of oil disp@@ er@@ sing ."
"And as you go down , they &apos;re cat@@ ching all kinds of plan@@ kt@@ on , bu@@ m@@ ping into , you know , little wi@@ sp@@ s of life that are the food for the plan@@ k@@ ti@@ vo@@ res , the her@@ ring kind of fish ."
And you could just see the we@@ b of death as you go down in the water col@@ um@@ n .
"Well , you know , we got into this in the beginning as a tra@@ de@@ -@@ off , they say , between the we@@ t@@ l@@ ands ver@@ su@@ s the ocean de@@ p@@ th ."
And I didn &apos;t ag@@ ree with that deci@@ sion at the time ; I still don &apos;t .
The deci@@ sion was to prote@@ ct the mar@@ sh@@ es .
"When the oil gets into the mar@@ sh@@ es , you can &apos;t get it out ."
"And as you know , there &apos;s been a very we@@ ak respon@@ se , up until re@@ cent@@ ly , to actually colle@@ ct the oil ."
It &apos;s got@@ ten much more ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sive .
"This is an E@@ x@@ x@@ on sli@@ de show@@ ing what happens , the scen@@ ari@@ o and the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off ."
So this shows oil on the surface .
"You can see it getting up into the m@@ ang@@ ro@@ ve , but it is not har@@ ming the cor@@ als or the se@@ a gra@@ ss , right ."
So here we have the other scen@@ ari@@ o .
"If you disp@@ er@@ se , the se@@ a gra@@ ss and the cor@@ als are getting h@@ it pretty hard , but you &apos;re sa@@ ving the m@@ ang@@ ro@@ ve ."
"So this , to me , is like going to the ey@@ e do@@ ctor , o@@ kay ?"
Is it better with one or two ?
"( Laughter ) The problem is that we have rele@@ as@@ ed so dar@@ n much of this stuff , we &apos;re clim@@ b@@ ing up to two million gal@@ l@@ ons very quickly ."
And then there &apos;s the problem of the p@@ lu@@ mes .
What p@@ lu@@ mes ?
It turns out there are p@@ lu@@ mes .
In@@ depen@@ dent resear@@ ch@@ ers found that .
"And then there &apos;s the lo@@ om@@ ing , mess@@ y problem of human health , re@@ por@@ ted human health effe@@ cts ."
"And actually , one of our fe@@ der@@ al offi@@ ci@@ als said that it was probably he@@ at stre@@ ss . So ..."
"H@@ a@@ ving been in that water just for the shor@@ t time I was there , I can tell you , it is not he@@ at stre@@ ss ."
"There are vol@@ um@@ es of vol@@ ati@@ le pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um f@@ um@@ es coming off that water , p@@ lu@@ s the C@@ ore@@ x@@ it , which has sol@@ v@@ ent in it ."
So it is not at all r@@ ational .
So what do we have ? The B@@ P show is going on .
"O@@ ur offi@@ ci@@ als com@@ pla@@ ined about C@@ ore@@ x@@ it , which is the most to@@ x@@ ic line of disp@@ er@@ s@@ an@@ ts ."
"But he@@ ck , they &apos;re still using it , and they used the most to@@ x@@ ic one , the 9@@ 5@@ 2@@ 7 , until they ran out of sup@@ pl@@ ies ."
Now they &apos;re on 9@@ 500 .
9@@ 5@@ 2@@ 7 had 2@@ -@@ bu@@ to@@ x@@ ye@@ th@@ an@@ ol in it that ca@@ uses inter@@ na@@ l b@@ le@@ e@@ ding .
"We know that from the E@@ x@@ x@@ on V@@ al@@ de@@ z spi@@ ll , by the way ."
"So what we &apos;re doing , we &apos;re pu@@ tting com@@ po@@ un@@ ds with pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um sol@@ v@@ ents on@@ to a pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um spi@@ ll ."
D@@ o@@ es this make sense ?
So this is the way it works .
And I want to show you this cu@@ te little thing that happens here .
It &apos;s a mi@@ cel@@ le .
Mi@@ cel@@ les form around the oil .
"And what happens first is the sol@@ v@@ ents bre@@ ak into the oil , the li@@ pi@@ d mem@@ br@@ ane , they let the sur@@ fac@@ tan@@ ts in there ."
"The sur@@ fac@@ tan@@ ts — which are like things we use on f@@ ast food w@@ ra@@ p@@ per@@ s — they gra@@ b around the dro@@ ple@@ ts of oil , and they make little , t@@ iny dro@@ ple@@ ts with nice , little sur@@ fac@@ t@@ ant ed@@ ges to them ."
The thing to remember about the mi@@ cel@@ les — these little flo@@ ating g@@ lo@@ bu@@ les of to@@ x@@ in — is they are there to deli@@ ver .
They &apos;re like the F@@ ed@@ E@@ x guys .
"And if you &apos;re a fish , and you ha@@ ven &apos;t got@@ ten your g@@ lo@@ b in the morning , you &apos;re going to get it in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , because they &apos;ve got your number ."
"So from a to@@ x@@ i@@ co@@ logy perspe@@ ctive , this is really aw@@ ful because C@@ ore@@ x@@ it and the disp@@ er@@ sed oil are much more to@@ x@@ ic together than either alone ."
And usu@@ ally the ex@@ pos@@ ure is a com@@ b@@ ined ex@@ pos@@ ure .
The disp@@ er@@ s@@ an@@ ts — as I was saying — their job is to bre@@ ak down the li@@ pi@@ d mem@@ br@@ ane .
The sol@@ v@@ ents in them do that very ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ tly .
"So they bre@@ ak down li@@ pi@@ d mem@@ bran@@ es in our body , star@@ ting with cells of the sk@@ in , the cells of or@@ g@@ ans ."
So it actually ha@@ st@@ ens oil getting into the body e@@ a@@ si@@ ly and re@@ ad@@ i@@ ly .
O@@ il con@@ ta@@ ins hundre@@ ds of hy@@ dro@@ car@@ b@@ on com@@ po@@ un@@ ds and other com@@ po@@ un@@ ds that are to@@ x@@ ic to every or@@ g@@ an in the body .
"And so with the disp@@ er@@ s@@ an@@ ts com@@ b@@ ined , you have this very sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ stic com@@ b@@ ined to@@ x@@ i@@ city ."
C@@ ore@@ x@@ it also con@@ ta@@ ins pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um sol@@ v@@ ents and many other to@@ x@@ ic com@@ po@@ un@@ ds .
"And I &apos;m part of a ch@@ at group , which is a national group of to@@ x@@ i@@ co@@ logi@@ sts and chemi@@ sts that are , you know , basically tur@@ ning car@@ t@@ whe@@ els trying to figure out what &apos;s in this stuff , and what is it doing and what are the inter@@ ac@@ tions of these chemi@@ cal@@ s , most of which we don &apos;t know , and what are their by@@ produ@@ cts , which are usu@@ ally more to@@ x@@ ic than the par@@ ent com@@ po@@ u@@ nd ."
"So we did find that C@@ ore@@ x@@ it 9@@ 500 con@@ ta@@ ins he@@ av@@ y me@@ tal@@ s , ar@@ s@@ eni@@ c and chro@@ mi@@ um — ar@@ s@@ eni@@ c at high enough le@@ v@@ els to have can@@ cer@@ -@@ ca@@ using effe@@ cts ."
"So this is what we have to look at , these , you know , ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous sa@@ fe@@ ty data sh@@ e@@ ets , which have nothing on them much ."
And now they were for@@ ced to rele@@ ase the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate li@@ st of everything that &apos;s in C@@ ore@@ x@@ it .
"And gu@@ ess what , t@@ ons of stuff is mis@@ sing ."
"D@@ eri@@ v@@ ati@@ ves , der@@ i@@ v@@ ati@@ ves , these are whole big grou@@ ps of many , many com@@ po@@ un@@ ds , these sor@@ bi@@ t@@ ans ."
"And then you get down to the pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um di@@ st@@ il@@ lat@@ es , which are the sol@@ v@@ ents , hundre@@ ds of them ."
They are not iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ied . And why ?
T@@ ra@@ de se@@ cre@@ ts again .
"B@@ P &apos;s ru@@ n@@ ning the show , and the N@@ al@@ co company , this is all they have to do ."
"So far these in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ ts have not been rele@@ as@@ ed , and to@@ x@@ i@@ co@@ logi@@ sts are actually going nu@@ ts because we cannot pre@@ di@@ ct with cer@@ tain@@ ty what the inter@@ ac@@ tions and to@@ x@@ ic resul@@ ts are going to be ."
"But we do have quite a lot at ri@@ sk down there , as we all know , the 3@@ 3 wil@@ d@@ life re@@ fu@@ ges , so much wil@@ d@@ life and fish and di@@ versity ."
So we know from pre@@ vi@@ ous sp@@ il@@ ls .
And then part of this is just part of my bad dre@@ am@@ s .
And I ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate being able to v@@ ent some of my ang@@ u@@ is@@ h upo@@ n you .
What we do know is that the cor@@ als are going to get h@@ it hard .
"And this is a study that was done on the Au@@ str@@ ali@@ an co@@ ast , the co@@ ast of T@@ as@@ m@@ ania ."
"C@@ or@@ als are , you know , the home to about a qu@@ ar@@ ter of all mar@@ ine species ."
"And with the C@@ ore@@ x@@ it and the oil , there &apos;s zer@@ o percent fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ation ."
"Wi@@ th oil alone , there &apos;s 9@@ 8 percent fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ation ."
So they &apos;re a very sen@@ si@@ tive species to this com@@ bo .
Here &apos;s another group .
I could see myself e@@ a@@ si@@ ly in the water col@@ um@@ n .
"The plan@@ kt@@ on and the plan@@ kt@@ on e@@ at@@ ers , you know , these are the little her@@ ring fish that go through the water col@@ um@@ n with their m@@ ou@@ ths open , fe@@ e@@ ding indi@@ sc@@ ri@@ min@@ ately and just la@@ pping up this b@@ row@@ n pu@@ d@@ ding of to@@ x@@ ic stuff ."
And we do know from other stud@@ ies that this is a high@@ ly to@@ x@@ ic mi@@ x@@ ture .
"S@@ e@@ e the oil and C@@ ore@@ x@@ it is ca@@ using death at a much , much low@@ er do@@ se than oil alone ."
That &apos;s probably as far as what we do know about to@@ x@@ ic effe@@ cts .
But my bad dre@@ am@@ s go like this .
"The pis@@ ci@@ vo@@ rou@@ s fish , the c@@ ob@@ ia , grou@@ per , am@@ ber@@ j@@ ac@@ ks , those big fish , also the tu@@ na and sh@@ ar@@ ks , are going to h@@ it by this ."
And the gi@@ l@@ ls are quite sen@@ si@@ tive .
The re@@ sp@@ ir@@ at@@ ory system is very sen@@ si@@ tive .
"Th@@ in@@ k about it with the C@@ ore@@ x@@ it hi@@ tting the mem@@ bran@@ es , and it will clo@@ g up the gi@@ l@@ ls , and then these animals are going to be getting something like what you call chemi@@ cal p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia , trying to as@@ pi@@ r@@ ate the com@@ po@@ un@@ ds ."
It also will cause inter@@ na@@ l b@@ le@@ e@@ ding upo@@ n ing@@ esti@@ on .
"I &apos;m very wor@@ ried about the air@@ -@@ bre@@ a@@ thing m@@ am@@ m@@ als because I study them , but also , the way their going to be ex@@ posed is every time they come to the surface to take a bre@@ ath , they &apos;re going to in@@ h@@ ale these vol@@ ati@@ le f@@ um@@ es ."
"And what does happen with that ev@@ en@@ tually is p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia se@@ ts in and li@@ ver , ki@@ d@@ ney , brain dam@@ age ."
The C@@ ore@@ x@@ it is transpor@@ ting the oil into every mem@@ br@@ ane and every system of the body .
"And you &apos;re having a lot of different un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant effe@@ cts , but bur@@ ns to the eyes and m@@ outh , sk@@ in ul@@ c@@ ers , le@@ sions ."
"And I think , per@@ son@@ ally , that we have not be@@ gu@@ n to see the impac@@ ts of this spi@@ ll on the wil@@ d@@ life of the G@@ ul@@ f ."
We started hy@@ po@@ the@@ si@@ z@@ ing : what do we know ?
what do with think would be a tro@@ phi@@ c c@@ as@@ c@@ ade ?
"@@ which means that somebody gets wi@@ ped out , and then everything ab@@ o@@ ve that &apos;s e@@ ating those guys will c@@ ra@@ sh ."
"So our thought was — this is a simple thinking process , but ..."
"@@ obvi@@ ously the plan@@ kt@@ on , the plan@@ k@@ ti@@ vo@@ res , and that &apos;s about as far as we got ."
And then it turns out we &apos;re not very good at fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing this stuff out .
"This is what the E@@ x@@ x@@ on V@@ al@@ de@@ z scienti@@ sts thought would happen , this tro@@ phi@@ c c@@ as@@ c@@ ade where you lo@@ se the k@@ el@@ p and the her@@ ring and other fi@@ sh@@ es and going up ."
They thought that ev@@ en@@ tually the kil@@ ler wh@@ ale would be at the top of this c@@ as@@ c@@ ade .
"And then here &apos;s what really happened , much more comp@@ lic@@ ated , much more speci@@ fic ."
A@@ c@@ tually the k@@ el@@ p and the bar@@ n@@ ac@@ les that att@@ ach to the ro@@ ck were deci@@ mat@@ ed by the com@@ bin@@ ation of C@@ ore@@ x@@ it and the oil .
"They were re@@ plac@@ ed by inv@@ a@@ sive species , which had less hol@@ ding power to the ro@@ ck ."
St@@ or@@ ms came along .
They ri@@ pped out of the ro@@ ck .
And this was the entire food we@@ b for the se@@ a du@@ cks .
"And as you know , we lost about 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 se@@ a du@@ cks from the E@@ x@@ x@@ on V@@ al@@ de@@ z spi@@ ll , and they ha@@ ven &apos;t come back ."
So we are la@@ un@@ ching an in@@ depen@@ dent study .
"And by in@@ depen@@ dent , I do not mean alone ; I mean in@@ depen@@ dent in the sense of not t@@ ied to the kind of cri@@ me@@ -@@ scen@@ e se@@ cre@@ cy that &apos;s going on in the G@@ ul@@ f now ."
"But we are actually going to be as@@ s@@ ess@@ ing to@@ x@@ ic impac@@ ts , but we need lots and lots of part@@ n@@ ers to do this inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ently ."
We have some of the part@@ n@@ ers lin@@ ed up .
And D@@ a@@ ve G@@ al@@ l@@ o sig@@ ned on .
Sy@@ l@@ vi@@ a &apos;s in here .
And we hope that some of you will help us .
My question to you is : why sh@@ ouldn &apos;t we know ?
D@@ on &apos;t we have the right to know ?
Su@@ re@@ ly we have the right to learn what lo@@ ss we are going through in the G@@ ul@@ f .
And my wi@@ sh would be — for the gu@@ l@@ f pri@@ ze — would be that we have the tru@@ th .
"Wh@@ atever it is , ple@@ ase let us have the tru@@ th ."
"And to get there , we need to do the as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment ."
So I ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate being here . Thank you .
( Applause )
This is about a place in Lon@@ don called K@@ i@@ te@@ f@@ ly@@ er &apos;s Hi@@ ll where I used to go and spend hours going &quot; &quot; When is he coming back ? When is he coming back ? &quot; &quot; So this is another one de@@ di@@ c@@ ated to that guy ...

"I gra@@ du@@ ated high school in C@@ le@@ v@@ el@@ and , O@@ hi@@ o , 19@@ 7@@ 5 ."
"And just like my parents did when they fini@@ shed stu@@ dy@@ ing ab@@ ro@@ ad , we went back home ."

"P@@ er@@ haps not , I should cer@@ tain@@ ly hope not — because that is not my vision ."
"A@@ ll right , for good meas@@ ure , that &apos;s where Nigeri@@ a is on the Afri@@ can ma@@ p , and just there is the D@@ el@@ ta regi@@ on that I &apos;m sure everybody &apos;s heard of ."
"P@@ e@@ ople getting ki@@ d@@ na@@ pped , where the oil comes from , the oil that sometimes I think has dri@@ ven us all c@@ razy in Nigeri@@ a ."
"But , cri@@ tical po@@ ver@@ ty : this sli@@ de is from a pres@@ ent@@ ation I gave not that long ago . G@@ ap@@ min@@ der@@ .@@ or@@ g tel@@ ls the story of the ga@@ p between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care ."
V@@ ery interesting .
How many people do you think are on that ta@@ x@@ i ?
"And believe it or not , that is a ta@@ x@@ i in Nigeri@@ a ."
"And the ca@@ pi@@ tal — well , what used to be the ca@@ pi@@ tal of Nigeri@@ a — L@@ a@@ go@@ s , that &apos;s a ta@@ x@@ i , and you have poli@@ ce on them ."
"So , tell me , how many poli@@ c@@ em@@ en do you think are on this ta@@ x@@ i ? And now ? Th@@ ree ."
"So , when these kind of people — and , believe me , it &apos;s not just the poli@@ ce that use these ta@@ x@@ is in L@@ a@@ go@@ s . We all do . I &apos;ve been on one of these , and I didn &apos;t have a hel@@ met , either ."
"And it just re@@ min@@ ds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a ta@@ x@@ i like this fal@@ ls off , has an ac@@ ci@@ dent and needs a ho@@ spit@@ al ."
"B@@ el@@ ie@@ ve it or not , some of us do survi@@ ve ."
S@@ ome of us do survi@@ ve mal@@ ar@@ ia ; we do survi@@ ve AIDS .
"And like I tell my family , and my wi@@ fe re@@ min@@ ds me every time , &quot; You &apos;re ri@@ sk@@ ing your life , you know , every time you go to that country . &quot;"
"And she &apos;s right . E@@ very time you go there , you know that if you actually need cri@@ tical care — cri@@ tical care of any sort — if you have an ac@@ ci@@ dent — of which there are many , there are ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents every@@ where — where do they go ?"
W@@ here do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff ?
"I &apos;m not saying instead of , I &apos;m saying as well as , AIDS , T@@ B , mal@@ ar@@ ia , ty@@ ph@@ o@@ id — the li@@ st goes on ."
"I &apos;m saying , where do they go when they &apos;re like me ?"
"When I go back home — and I do all kinds of things , I te@@ ach , I tra@@ in — but I cat@@ ch one of these things , or I &apos;m chro@@ ni@@ cally i@@ ll with one of those , where do they go ?"
What &apos;s the economic impac@@ t when one of them d@@ ies or be@@ comes dis@@ ab@@ led ?
I think it &apos;s quite sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant . This is where they go .
"These are not old pi@@ ctures and these are not from some dow@@ n@@ tro@@ d@@ den — this is a major ho@@ spit@@ al . In fact , it &apos;s from a major teach@@ ing ho@@ spit@@ al in Nigeri@@ a ."
"Now that is less than a year old , in an oper@@ ating room ."
That &apos;s st@@ eri@@ liz@@ ing e@@ qui@@ pment in Nigeri@@ a .
You remember all that oil ?
"@@ Yes , I &apos;m sor@@ ry if it up@@ se@@ ts some of you , but I think you need to see this . That &apos;s the flo@@ or , OK ?"
You can say some of this is education .
You can say it &apos;s hy@@ g@@ ie@@ ne . I &apos;m not ple@@ ading po@@ ver@@ ty .
"I &apos;m saying we need more than just , you know , vac@@ cin@@ ation , mal@@ ar@@ ia , AIDS , because I want to be tre@@ ated in a pro@@ per ho@@ spit@@ al if something happens to me out there ."
"In fact , when I start ru@@ n@@ ning around saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , bo@@ ys and girls , you &apos;re car@@ di@@ ologi@@ sts in the U.@@ S. , can you come home with me and do a mis@@ sion ? &quot; &quot; I want them to think , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s some hope . &quot; &quot; Now , have a look at that . That &apos;s the an@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ o@@ logy mach@@ ine ."
"And that &apos;s my speci@@ al@@ ty , right ?"
An@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ o@@ logy and cri@@ tical care — look at that ba@@ g .
It &apos;s been ta@@ ped with ta@@ pe that we even stop@@ ped using in the U.@@ K@@ .
"And believe me , these are cur@@ r@@ ent pi@@ ctures ."
"Now , if something like this , which has happened in the U.@@ K@@ . , that &apos;s where they go . This is the inten@@ sive care uni@@ t in which I work ."
"A@@ ll right , this is a sli@@ de from a talk I gave about inten@@ sive care uni@@ ts in Nigeri@@ a , and jo@@ k@@ ing@@ ly we ref@@ er to it as &quot; &quot; E@@ x@@ pen@@ sive S@@ care . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sc@@ ary and it &apos;s ex@@ pen@@ sive , but we need to have it , OK ?"
"So , these are the problems ."
"There are no pri@@ z@@ es for tel@@ ling us what the problems are , are there ?"
I think we all know . And se@@ ver@@ al spe@@ ak@@ ers before and spe@@ ak@@ ers after me are going to tell us even more problems .
"These are a few of them . So , what did I do ?"
There we go — we &apos;re going on a mis@@ sion .
"We &apos;re going to do some open@@ -@@ heart sur@@ g@@ ery . I was the only B@@ r@@ it , on a team of about n@@ ine American car@@ di@@ a@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons , car@@ di@@ a@@ c n@@ ur@@ se , inten@@ sive care n@@ ur@@ se ."
We all went out and did a mis@@ sion and we &apos;ve done three of them so far .
"J@@ ust so you know , I do believe in mis@@ sions , I do believe in a@@ id and I do believe in ch@@ ari@@ ty . They have their place , but where do they go for those things we tal@@ ked about ear@@ lie@@ r ?"
Because it &apos;s not everyone that &apos;s going to b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from a mis@@ sion .
"H@@ e@@ alth is we@@ alth , in the words of H@@ ans R@@ os@@ ling ."
You get we@@ al@@ th@@ ier f@@ ast@@ er if you are health@@ y first .
"So , here we are , mis@@ sion . Bi@@ g t@@ rou@@ ble ."
O@@ pen@@ -@@ heart sur@@ g@@ ery in Nigeri@@ a — big t@@ rou@@ ble .
"That &apos;s Mi@@ ke , Mi@@ ke comes out from M@@ is@@ si@@ s@@ si@@ pp@@ i ."
D@@ o@@ es he look like he &apos;s happy ?
"It took us two days just to organi@@ ze the place , but h@@ ey , you know , we worked on it . D@@ o@@ es he look happy ?"
"@@ Yes , that &apos;s the medi@@ cal ad@@ vice the com@@ mi@@ t@@ te@@ e cha@@ ir@@ man says , &quot; &quot; Yes , I told you , you wer@@ en &apos;t going to be able to , you can &apos;t do this , I just know it . &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , that &apos;s the techni@@ ci@@ an we had . So y@@ es , you go on , all right ?"
( Laughter ) I got him to come with me — an@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a te@@ ch — come with me from the U.@@ K@@ .
"@@ Yes , let &apos;s just go work this thing out ."
"S@@ e@@ e , that &apos;s one of the problems we have in Nigeri@@ a and in Africa gener@@ ally ."
We get a lot of d@@ on@@ ated e@@ qui@@ pment .
"E@@ qui@@ pment that &apos;s ob@@ so@@ le@@ te , e@@ qui@@ pment that doesn &apos;t quite work , or it works and you can &apos;t fi@@ x it . And there &apos;s nothing wrong with that , so long as we use it and we move on ."
But we had problems with it . We had se@@ v@@ ere problems there .
He had to get on the phone . This guy was always on the phone .
So what we going to do now ?
"It looks like all these Ameri@@ cans are here and y@@ es , one B@@ r@@ it , and he &apos;s not going to do anything — he thin@@ ks he &apos;s Bri@@ ti@@ sh actually , and he &apos;s actually Nigeri@@ an , I just thought about that ."
"We ev@@ en@@ tually got it working , is the tru@@ th , but it was one of these . E@@ ven ol@@ der than the one you saw ."
"The reason I have this picture here , this X@@ -@@ ra@@ y , it &apos;s just to tell you where and how we were vie@@ w@@ ing X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys ."
Do you figure where that is ? It was on a win@@ do@@ w .
"I mean , what &apos;s an X@@ -@@ ra@@ y vie@@ w@@ ing box ? P@@ le@@ ase ."
"Well , now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys everything &apos;s on P@@ A@@ X any@@ way ."
"You look at your X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys on a scre@@ en and you do stuff with them , you e@@ ma@@ il them . But we were still using X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys , but we didn &apos;t even have a vie@@ w@@ ing box !"
And we were doing open@@ -@@ heart sur@@ g@@ ery .
"O@@ K , I know it &apos;s not AIDS , I know it &apos;s not mal@@ ar@@ ia , but we still need this stuff . Oh ye@@ ah , ech@@ o — this was just to get the children ready and the ad@@ ul@@ ts ready ."
"P@@ e@@ ople still believe in V@@ o@@ od@@ o@@ o . H@@ ear@@ t dise@@ ase , V@@ S@@ D , ho@@ le in the heart , te@@ tr@@ al@@ og@@ ies ."
You still get people who believe in it and they came .
"A@@ t 6@@ 7 percent o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en s@@ atur@@ ation , the nor@@ mal is about 9@@ 7 ."
"H@@ er con@@ di@@ tion , open@@ -@@ heart sur@@ g@@ ery that as she requi@@ red , would have been tre@@ ated when she was a child ."
"We had to do these for ad@@ ul@@ ts . So , we did suc@@ ce@@ ed and we still do ."
"We &apos;ve done three . We &apos;re plan@@ ning another one in Ju@@ ly in the nor@@ th of the country .

The o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en tan@@ ks didn &apos;t quite work right .
But how many did we do the first one ? 12 .
We did 12 open@@ -@@ heart sur@@ gi@@ cal patients suc@@ cess@@ fully .

This one &apos;s so@@ le a@@ im is to provi@@ de the very things that I think are mis@@ sing .

Is it d@@ ent@@ al sur@@ g@@ ery you want ? G@@ ener@@ al sur@@ g@@ ery you want ?

So that &apos;s not new . What we &apos;re doing is ap@@ pl@@ ying this technology to it .

What is so spe@@ cial about the human brain ?
Why is it that we study other animals instead of them stu@@ dy@@ ing us ?
What does a human brain have or do that no other brain does ?
"When I became interested in these questions about 10 years ago , scienti@@ sts thought they knew what different bra@@ ins were made of ."
"Now , if neuron@@ s are the fun@@ cti@@ onal information pro@@ cess@@ ing uni@@ ts of the brain , then the ow@@ n@@ ers of these two bra@@ ins should have si@@ mi@@ lar cogni@@ tive abi@@ lit@@ ies ."
"And yet , one is a ch@@ im@@ p , and the other is a c@@ ow ."
"Now maybe c@@ ow@@ s have a really ri@@ ch inter@@ na@@ l ment@@ al life and are so s@@ mar@@ t that they cho@@ ose not to let us realize it , but we e@@ at them ."
But let &apos;s play along .
So the largest brain around should also be the most cogni@@ ti@@ vely able .
"And here comes the bad news : O@@ ur brain , not the largest one around ."
It seem@@ s quite v@@ ex@@ ing .
"O@@ ur brain we@@ igh@@ s between 1@@ .@@ 2 and 1@@ .@@ 5 ki@@ lo@@ s , but ele@@ ph@@ ant bra@@ ins we@@ i@@ gh between four and five ki@@ lo@@ s , and wh@@ ale bra@@ ins can we@@ i@@ gh up to n@@ ine ki@@ lo@@ s , which is why scienti@@ sts used to re@@ sort to saying that our brain must be spe@@ cial to expla@@ in our cogni@@ tive abi@@ lit@@ ies ."
"It must be really ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary , an ex@@ cep@@ tion to the ru@@ le ."
So that would give us ex@@ tra cor@@ te@@ x to do more interesting things than just oper@@ ating the body .
So the ma@@ in reason for saying that our brain is lar@@ ger than it should be actually comes from com@@ par@@ ing ourselves to great ap@@ es .
"G@@ or@@ il@@ l@@ as can be two to three times lar@@ ger than we are , so their bra@@ ins should also be lar@@ ger than ours , but instead it &apos;s the other way around ."
O@@ ur brain is three times lar@@ ger than a gor@@ il@@ la brain .
The human brain also seem@@ s spe@@ cial in the amount of energy that it uses .
"That &apos;s 500 cal@@ or@@ ies out of a tot@@ al of 2@@ ,000 cal@@ or@@ ies , just to keep your brain working ."
And this is where the story started to bo@@ ther me .
"In bio@@ logy , we look for ru@@ les that app@@ ly to all animals and to life in gener@@ al , so why should the ru@@ les of ev@@ olution app@@ ly to everybody else but not to us ?"
"M@@ a@@ ybe the human brain actually has the most neuron@@ s of any brain , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of its size , es@@ pe@@ cially in the cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l cor@@ te@@ x ."
"So this to me became the important question to answer : how many neuron@@ s does the human brain have , and how does that comp@@ are to other animals ?"
"Now , you may have heard or read some@@ where that we have 100 billion neuron@@ s , so 10 years ago , I asked my colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es if they knew where this number came from ."
But no@@ body did .
"It seem@@ s that no@@ body had actually ever coun@@ ted the number of neuron@@ s in the human brain , or in any other brain for that matter ."
"So I came up with my own way to coun@@ t cells in the brain , and it essen@@ ti@@ ally consi@@ sts of dis@@ sol@@ ving that brain into s@@ ou@@ p ."
"It works like this : You take a brain , or par@@ ts of that brain , and you dis@@ sol@@ ve it in de@@ ter@@ g@@ ent , which de@@ stro@@ ys the cell mem@@ bran@@ es but ke@@ e@@ ps the cell nu@@ cle@@ i in@@ t@@ act , so you end up with a s@@ us@@ pen@@ sion of f@@ ree nu@@ cle@@ i that looks like this , like a clear s@@ ou@@ p ."
This s@@ ou@@ p con@@ ta@@ ins all the nu@@ cle@@ i that once were a m@@ ou@@ se brain .
"Now , the beau@@ ty of a s@@ ou@@ p is that because it is s@@ ou@@ p , you can ag@@ it@@ ate it and make those nu@@ cle@@ i be di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted hom@@ og@@ ene@@ ously in the li@@ qu@@ id , so that now by looking under the micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e at just four or five sam@@ ples of this hom@@ og@@ ene@@ ous solution , you can coun@@ t nu@@ cle@@ i , and ther@@ e@@ fore tell how many cells that brain had ."
"It &apos;s simple , it &apos;s stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward , and it &apos;s really f@@ ast ."
"T@@ ake rod@@ ents and pri@@ mat@@ es , for in@@ stance : In lar@@ ger ro@@ dent bra@@ ins , the a@@ ver@@ age size of the neuro@@ n incre@@ ases , so the brain in@@ f@@ lat@@ es very ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly and ga@@ ins size much f@@ ast@@ er than it ga@@ ins neuron@@ s ."
"But pri@@ m@@ ate bra@@ ins ga@@ in neuron@@ s without the a@@ ver@@ age neuro@@ n be@@ coming any lar@@ ger , which is a very econ@@ omi@@ cal way to ad@@ d neuron@@ s to your brain ."
"The resul@@ t is that a pri@@ m@@ ate brain will always have more neuron@@ s than a ro@@ dent brain of the same size , and the lar@@ ger the brain , the lar@@ ger this difference will be ."
"Well , what about our brain then ?"
"We found that we have , on a@@ ver@@ age , 8@@ 6 billion neuron@@ s , 16 billion of which are in the cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l cor@@ te@@ x , and if you consi@@ der that the cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l cor@@ te@@ x is the se@@ at of fun@@ ctions like aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess and logi@@ cal and ab@@ strac@@ t reas@@ on@@ ing , and that 16 billion is the most neuron@@ s that any cor@@ te@@ x has , I think this is the sim@@ pl@@ est ex@@ plan@@ ation for our re@@ mark@@ able cogni@@ tive abi@@ lit@@ ies ."
But just as important is what the 8@@ 6 billion neuron@@ s mean .
"Because we found that the relation@@ ship between the size of the brain and its number of neuron@@ s could be descri@@ bed ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cally , we could cal@@ cul@@ ate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a ro@@ dent brain ."
"So , a ro@@ dent brain with 8@@ 6 billion neuron@@ s would we@@ i@@ gh 3@@ 6 ki@@ lo@@ s ."
That &apos;s not possible .
"A brain that huge would be c@@ rus@@ h@@ ed by its own we@@ ight , and this im@@ possible brain would go in the body of 8@@ 9 t@@ ons ."
I don &apos;t think it looks like us .
"So this br@@ ings us to a very important con@@ clu@@ sion already , which is that we are not rod@@ ents ."
The human brain is not a large r@@ at brain .
"C@@ om@@ par@@ ed to a r@@ at , we might se@@ em spe@@ cial , y@@ es , but that &apos;s not a fa@@ ir com@@ par@@ is@@ on to make , given that we know that we are not rod@@ ents ."
"And there , if you do the mat@@ h , you find that a gen@@ eri@@ c pri@@ m@@ ate with 8@@ 6 billion neuron@@ s would have a brain of about 1@@ .@@ 2 ki@@ lo@@ s , which seem@@ s just right , in a body of some 6@@ 6 ki@@ lo@@ s , which in my case is exactly right , which br@@ ings us to a very un@@ sur@@ pri@@ sing but still incredi@@ bly important con@@ clu@@ sion : I am a pri@@ m@@ ate ."
And all of you are pri@@ mat@@ es .
And so was D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n .
I love to think that D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n would have really ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated this .
"H@@ is brain , like ours , was made in the image of other pri@@ m@@ ate bra@@ ins ."
"So the human brain may be re@@ mark@@ able , y@@ es , but it is not spe@@ cial in its number of neuron@@ s ."
It is just a large pri@@ m@@ ate brain .
I think that &apos;s a very hum@@ b@@ ling and sob@@ ering thought that should re@@ mind us of our place in nature .
"Wh@@ y does it cost so much energy , then ?"
"So the tot@@ al ener@@ ge@@ tic cost of a brain is a simple , lin@@ e@@ ar fun@@ ction of its number of neuron@@ s , and it turns out that the human brain co@@ sts just as much energy as you would expe@@ ct ."
"So the reason why the human brain co@@ sts so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neuron@@ s , and because we are pri@@ mat@@ es with many more neuron@@ s for a given body size than any other ani@@ mal , the rel@@ ative cost of our brain is large , but just because we &apos;re pri@@ mat@@ es , not because we &apos;re spe@@ cial ."
"L@@ ast question , then : how did we come by this re@@ mark@@ able number of neuron@@ s , and in particular , if great ap@@ es are lar@@ ger than we are , why don &apos;t they have a lar@@ ger brain than we do , with more neuron@@ s ?"
They just can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d the energy for both a large body and a large number of neuron@@ s .
So we did the mat@@ h .
"And what we found is that because neuron@@ s are so ex@@ pen@@ sive , there is a tra@@ de@@ off between body size and number of neuron@@ s ."
"So a pri@@ m@@ ate that e@@ ats eight hours per day can af@@ for@@ d at most 5@@ 3 billion neuron@@ s , but then its body cannot be any bi@@ g@@ ger than 25 ki@@ lo@@ s ."
"To we@@ i@@ gh any more than that , it has to give up neuron@@ s ."
So it &apos;s either a large body or a large number of neuron@@ s .
"When you e@@ at like a pri@@ m@@ ate , you can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d both ."
"G@@ or@@ il@@ l@@ as and or@@ ang@@ ut@@ ans , for in@@ stance , af@@ for@@ d about 30 billion neuron@@ s by sp@@ ending eight and a half hours per day e@@ ating , and that seem@@ s to be about as much as they can do ."
N@@ ine hours of fe@@ e@@ ding per day seem@@ s to be the prac@@ tical lim@@ it for a pri@@ m@@ ate .
What about us ?
"Wi@@ th our 8@@ 6 billion neuron@@ s and 60 to 70 ki@@ lo@@ s of body mas@@ s , we should have to spend over n@@ ine hours per day every single day fe@@ e@@ ding , which is just not fe@@ a@@ si@@ ble ."
"If we ate like a pri@@ m@@ ate , we should not be here ."
"H@@ ow did we get here , then ?"
"Well , if our brain co@@ sts just as much energy as it should , and if we can &apos;t spend every wa@@ king hour of the day fe@@ e@@ ding , then the only alter@@ n@@ ative , really , is to some@@ how get more energy out of the same fo@@ ods ."
"And re@@ mark@@ ably , that mat@@ ch@@ es exactly what our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors are belie@@ ved to have inv@@ en@@ ted one and a half million years ago , when they inv@@ en@@ ted co@@ o@@ king ."
To co@@ ok is to use fi@@ re to pre@@ -@@ di@@ gest fo@@ ods outside of your body .
"So because of co@@ o@@ king , what once was a major li@@ ability , this large , d@@ ang@@ er@@ ously ex@@ pen@@ sive brain with a lot of neuron@@ s , could now become a major as@@ set , now that we could both af@@ for@@ d the energy for a lot of neuron@@ s and the time to do interesting things with them ."
"So I think this expla@@ ins why the human brain gre@@ w to become so large so f@@ ast in ev@@ olution , all of the while re@@ ma@@ ining just a pri@@ m@@ ate brain ."
"Wi@@ th this large brain now af@@ for@@ d@@ able by co@@ o@@ king , we went ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly from ra@@ w fo@@ ods to culture , agri@@ culture , ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , gro@@ cer@@ y sto@@ res , electri@@ city , ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ at@@ ors , all of those things that now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys al@@ low us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te f@@ ast food jo@@ int ."
"So what once was a solution now became the problem , and i@@ ro@@ ni@@ cally , we look for the solution in ra@@ w food ."
So what is the human adv@@ an@@ t@@ age ?
What is it that we have that no other ani@@ mal has ?
"And what is it that we do that no other ani@@ mal does , and which I believe was fundam@@ ent@@ al to al@@ low us to re@@ ach that large , largest number of neuron@@ s in the cor@@ te@@ x ?"
"In two words , we co@@ ok ."
No other ani@@ mal co@@ o@@ ks its food . O@@ n@@ ly hum@@ ans do .
And I think that &apos;s how we got to become human .
S@@ tu@@ dy@@ ing the human brain changed the way I think about food .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
( Music ) Go@@ od af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
"As you &apos;re all aw@@ are , we face difficult economic times ."
I come to you with a mo@@ d@@ est pro@@ pos@@ al for e@@ as@@ ing the fin@@ an@@ cial bur@@ den .
This idea came to me while talking to a physi@@ ci@@ st friend of m@@ ine at M@@ I@@ T .
He was stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing to expla@@ in something to me : a beautiful experim@@ ent that uses las@@ ers to cool down matter .
"Now he con@@ f@@ used me from the very start , because light doesn &apos;t cool things down ."
It makes it hot@@ ter . It &apos;s happening right now .
"The reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is fil@@ led with more than 100 qu@@ in@@ ti@@ llion ph@@ ot@@ ons , and they &apos;re moving ran@@ dom@@ ly through the space , ne@@ ar the speed of light ."
"A@@ ll of them are different col@@ ors , they &apos;re ri@@ p@@ pl@@ ing with different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cies , and they &apos;re b@@ oun@@ cing off every surface , inclu@@ ding me , and some of those are fl@@ ying dire@@ ct@@ ly into your eyes , and that &apos;s why your brain is form@@ ing an image of me standing here ."
Now a las@@ er is different .
"It also uses ph@@ ot@@ ons , but they &apos;re all syn@@ chro@@ ni@@ zed , and if you fo@@ cus them into a be@@ am , what you have is an incredi@@ bly us@@ e@@ ful to@@ ol ."
"The control of a las@@ er is so pre@@ ci@@ se that you can per@@ form sur@@ g@@ ery inside of an ey@@ e , you can use it to stor@@ e mas@@ sive amoun@@ ts of data , and you can use it for this beautiful experim@@ ent that my friend was stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing to expla@@ in ."
F@@ ir@@ st you tra@@ p at@@ oms in a spe@@ cial bot@@ tle .
It uses ele@@ c@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic fie@@ l@@ ds to is@@ ol@@ ate the at@@ oms from the no@@ ise of the environment .
"And the at@@ oms themselves are quite viol@@ ent , but if you fi@@ re las@@ ers that are pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly tu@@ ned to the right fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy , an at@@ om will br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly ab@@ sor@@ b those ph@@ ot@@ ons and ten@@ d to s@@ low down ."
L@@ it@@ tle by little it gets col@@ der until ev@@ en@@ tually it appro@@ ach@@ es absolu@@ te zer@@ o .
"Now if you use the right kind of at@@ oms and you get them c@@ old enough , something tru@@ ly bi@@ zar@@ re happens ."
"It &apos;s no longer a so@@ li@@ d , a li@@ qu@@ id or a gas ."
It en@@ ters a new state of matter called a super@@ flu@@ id .
"The at@@ oms lo@@ se their individu@@ al iden@@ ti@@ ty , and the ru@@ les from the qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m world take over , and that &apos;s what gi@@ ves super@@ flu@@ i@@ ds such spo@@ ok@@ y pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"For example , if you sh@@ ine light through a super@@ flu@@ id , it is able to s@@ low ph@@ ot@@ ons down to 60 kilome@@ ters per hour ."
"A@@ no@@ ther spo@@ ok@@ y pro@@ per@@ ty is that it f@@ low@@ s with absolu@@ tely no vi@@ s@@ co@@ sity or f@@ ri@@ ction , so if you were to take the li@@ d off that bot@@ tle , it won &apos;t st@@ ay inside ."
"A th@@ in film will cre@@ ep up the inside w@@ all , f@@ low over the top and right out the outside ."
"Now of course , the moment that it does h@@ it the outside environment , and its temper@@ ature ri@@ ses by even a f@@ rac@@ tion of a de@@ gre@@ e , it im@@ medi@@ ately turns back into nor@@ mal matter ."
Su@@ per@@ flu@@ i@@ ds are one of the most fra@@ gi@@ le things we &apos;ve ever disco@@ vered .
And this is the great ple@@ as@@ ure of science : the de@@ fe@@ at of our in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion through experim@@ ent@@ ation .
"But the experim@@ ent is not the end of the story , because you still have to trans@@ m@@ it that know@@ le@@ dge to other people ."
I have a P@@ h@@ .@@ D in mo@@ le@@ cular bio@@ logy .
I still bar@@ ely understand what most scienti@@ sts are talking about .
"So as my friend was trying to expla@@ in that experim@@ ent , it seem@@ ed like the more he said , the less I under@@ sto@@ od ."
"Because if you &apos;re trying to give someone the big picture of a comple@@ x idea , to really cap@@ ture its essen@@ ce , the fe@@ wer words you use , the better ."
"In fact , the ide@@ al may be to use no words at all ."
"I remember thinking , my friend could have expla@@ ined that entire experim@@ ent with a dance ."
"O@@ f course , there never se@@ em to be any dan@@ c@@ ers around when you need them ."
"Now , the idea is not as c@@ razy as it sounds ."
I started a con@@ test four years ago called D@@ ance Y@@ our P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ .
"In@@ ste@@ ad of expla@@ ining their research with words , scienti@@ sts have to expla@@ in it with dance ."
"Now sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly , it seem@@ s to work ."
D@@ ance really can make science e@@ as@@ ier to understand .
But don &apos;t take my word for it .
G@@ o on the Inter@@ net and sear@@ ch for &quot; &quot; D@@ ance Y@@ our P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . &quot; &quot; There are hundre@@ ds of dan@@ cing scienti@@ sts wai@@ ting for you .
The most sur@@ pri@@ sing thing that I &apos;ve learned while ru@@ n@@ ning this con@@ test is that some scienti@@ sts are now working dire@@ ct@@ ly with dan@@ c@@ ers on their research .
"For example , at the Uni@@ versity of M@@ in@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a , there &apos;s a bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal engine@@ er na@@ med Davi@@ d Od@@ de , and he works with dan@@ c@@ ers to study how cells move ."
They do it by chang@@ ing their sha@@ pe .
"When a chemi@@ cal sig@@ na@@ l wa@@ sh@@ es up on one side , it tri@@ gg@@ ers the cell to ex@@ p@@ and its sha@@ pe on that side , because the cell is con@@ stan@@ tly tou@@ ching and tu@@ gg@@ ing at the environment ."
So that allow@@ s cells to o@@ o@@ ze along in the right dire@@ ctions .
"But what seem@@ s so s@@ low and g@@ rac@@ e@@ ful from the outside is really more like cha@@ os inside , because cells control their sha@@ pe with a sk@@ ele@@ ton of ri@@ gi@@ d prote@@ in fi@@ bers , and those fi@@ bers are con@@ stan@@ tly fal@@ ling a@@ part ."
"But just as quickly as they ex@@ plo@@ de , more prote@@ ins att@@ ach to the en@@ ds and gro@@ w them longer , so it &apos;s con@@ stan@@ tly chang@@ ing just to re@@ ma@@ in exactly the same ."
"Now , Davi@@ d buil@@ ds ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal mode@@ ls of this and then he te@@ sts those in the la@@ b , but before he does that , he works with dan@@ c@@ ers to figure out what kinds of mode@@ ls to build in the first place ."
"It &apos;s basically ef@@ fi@@ cient bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming , and when I visi@@ ted Davi@@ d to learn about his research , he used dan@@ c@@ ers to expla@@ in it to me rather than the usu@@ al meth@@ od : Pow@@ er@@ Po@@ int ."
And this br@@ ings me to my mo@@ d@@ est pro@@ pos@@ al .
I think that bad Pow@@ er@@ Po@@ int pres@@ ent@@ ations are a seri@@ ous thre@@ at to the global econom@@ y .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now it does de@@ p@@ end on how you meas@@ ure it , of course , but one est@@ im@@ ate has put the dra@@ in at 2@@ 50 million dollars per day ."
"Now that as@@ su@@ mes hal@@ f-@@ hour pres@@ ent@@ ations for an a@@ ver@@ age audience of four people with s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies of 3@@ 5@@ ,000 dollars , and it con@@ ser@@ v@@ ati@@ vely as@@ su@@ mes that about a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the pres@@ ent@@ ations are a comple@@ te wa@@ ste of time , and given that there are some ap@@ par@@ ently 30 million Pow@@ er@@ Po@@ int pres@@ ent@@ ations created every day , that would in@@ de@@ ed ad@@ d up to an an@@ nu@@ al wa@@ ste of 100 billion dollars ."
"O@@ f course , that &apos;s just the time we &apos;re lo@@ sing sitting through pres@@ ent@@ ations ."
"There are other co@@ sts , because Pow@@ er@@ Po@@ int is a to@@ ol , and like any to@@ ol , it can and will be ab@@ used ."
"To bor@@ row a con@@ cept from my country &apos;s C@@ I@@ A , it hel@@ ps you to so@@ f@@ ten up your audience ."
"It di@@ strac@@ ts them with pretty pi@@ ctures , ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant data ."
"It allow@@ s you to create the il@@ lu@@ sion of compe@@ ten@@ ce , the il@@ lu@@ sion of sim@@ pli@@ city , and most de@@ stru@@ cti@@ vely , the il@@ lu@@ sion of under@@ standing ."
So now my country is 15 tri@@ llion dollars in de@@ b@@ t .
O@@ ur le@@ ad@@ ers are working ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly to try and find ways to sa@@ ve money .
One idea is to dra@@ sti@@ cally redu@@ ce public sup@@ port for the ar@@ ts .
"For example , our N@@ ational En@@ dow@@ ment for the Ar@@ ts , with its $ 1@@ 50 million bud@@ get , s@@ las@@ h@@ ing that program would im@@ medi@@ ately redu@@ ce the national de@@ b@@ t by about one one@@ -@@ thous@@ and@@ th of a percent ."
One cer@@ tain@@ ly can &apos;t ar@@ gu@@ e with those num@@ bers .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , once we e@@ li@@ min@@ ate public fun@@ ding for the ar@@ ts , there will be some d@@ raw@@ bac@@ ks ."
The arti@@ sts on the stre@@ et will s@@ well the ran@@ ks of the u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ yed .
"M@@ any will turn to dru@@ g ab@@ use and pro@@ stitu@@ tion , and that will in@@ evi@@ t@@ ably low@@ er pro@@ per@@ ty val@@ u@@ es in urb@@ an neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods ."
All of this could wi@@ pe out the sa@@ v@@ ings we &apos;re hop@@ ing to make in the first place .
"I sh@@ all now , ther@@ e@@ fore , hum@@ bly pro@@ pos@@ e my own thou@@ ghts , which I hope will not be li@@ able to the least obje@@ ction ."
"O@@ n@@ ce we e@@ li@@ min@@ ate public fun@@ ding for the arti@@ sts , let &apos;s put them back to work by using them instead of Pow@@ er@@ Po@@ int ."
"As a test case , I pro@@ pos@@ e we start with American dan@@ c@@ ers ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , they are the most per@@ is@@ ha@@ ble of their kind , pro@@ ne to in@@ j@@ ury and very s@@ low to he@@ al du@@ e to our health care system ."
"R@@ a@@ ther than dan@@ cing our P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ s , we should use dance to expla@@ in all of our comple@@ x problems ."
I@@ mag@@ ine our poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans using dance to expla@@ in why we must inv@@ ade a fore@@ ig@@ n country or ba@@ il out an inv@@ est@@ ment b@@ ank .
It &apos;s sure to help .
"O@@ f course some@@ day , in the de@@ ep future , a technology of per@@ su@@ a@@ sion even more powerful than Pow@@ er@@ Po@@ int may be inv@@ en@@ ted , ren@@ der@@ ing dan@@ c@@ ers un@@ ne@@ cess@@ ary as to@@ ols of r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , I tr@@ ust that by that day , we sh@@ all have pas@@ sed this present fin@@ an@@ cial cal@@ ami@@ ty ."
P@@ er@@ haps by then we will be able to af@@ for@@ d the lu@@ x@@ ury of just sitting in an audience with no other pur@@ pos@@ e than to wit@@ ness the human form in moti@@ on .
( Music ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk about two stories today .
One is how we need to use marke@@ t-@@ based pri@@ cing to af@@ fe@@ ct de@@ m@@ and and use wi@@ rel@@ ess technolog@@ ies to dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally redu@@ ce our e@@ mis@@ sions in the transpor@@ tation se@@ ctor .
And the other is that there is an incredible opportunity if we cho@@ ose the right wi@@ rel@@ ess technolog@@ ies ; how we can gener@@ ate a new eng@@ ine for economic grow@@ th and dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally redu@@ ce C@@ 0@@ 2 in the other se@@ ct@@ ors .
I &apos;m really sc@@ ared .
We need to redu@@ ce C@@ 0@@ 2 e@@ mis@@ sions in ten to fi@@ f@@ te@@ en years by 80 percent in order to a@@ ver@@ t cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ hi@@ c effe@@ cts .
And I am ast@@ oun@@ ded that I &apos;m standing here to tell you that .
What are cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ hi@@ c effe@@ cts ? A three de@@ gre@@ e cen@@ ti@@ gra@@ de clim@@ ate change ri@@ se that will resul@@ t in 50 percent species ex@@ t@@ in@@ ction .
It &apos;s not a movie . This is real life .
"And I &apos;m really wor@@ ried , because when people talk about cars — which I know something about — the pre@@ ss and poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans and people in this room are all thinking , &quot; Let &apos;s use fu@@ el@@ -@@ ef@@ fi@@ cient cars . &quot;"
"If we started today , 10 years from now , at the end of this win@@ do@@ w of opportunity , those fu@@ el@@ -@@ ef@@ fi@@ cient cars will redu@@ ce our f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ el needs by four percent ."
That is not enough .
But now I &apos;ll talk about some more ple@@ as@@ ant things .
Here are some ways that we can make some dra@@ m@@ atic chang@@ es .
"So , Z@@ i@@ p@@ car is a company that I f@@ oun@@ ded seven years ago , but it &apos;s an example of something called car sh@@ aring ."
"What Z@@ i@@ p@@ car does is we par@@ k cars throu@@ gh@@ out den@@ se urb@@ an are@@ as for mem@@ bers to re@@ ser@@ ve , by the hour and by the day , instead of using their own car ."
How does it feel to be a person using a Z@@ i@@ p@@ car ?
It means that I pay only for what I need .
"A@@ ll those hours when a car is sitting i@@ d@@ le , I &apos;m not pa@@ ying for it ."
It means that I can cho@@ ose a car exactly for that particular tri@@ p .
"So , here &apos;s a woman that re@@ ser@@ ved M@@ ini@@ M@@ ia , and she had her day ."
I can take a B@@ M@@ W when I &apos;m seeing cl@@ ien@@ ts .
I can dri@@ ve my T@@ o@@ y@@ ot@@ a E@@ le@@ ment when I &apos;m going to go on that sur@@ f@@ ing tri@@ p .
"And the other re@@ mark@@ able thing is it &apos;s , I think , the high@@ est stat@@ us of car ow@@ ner@@ ship ."
"N@@ ot only do I have a f@@ le@@ et of cars available to me in seven cities around the world that I can have at my be@@ ck and call , but he@@ a@@ ven for@@ bi@@ d I would ever ma@@ in@@ tain or deal with the re@@ pa@@ ir or have anything to do with it ."
It &apos;s like the car that you always wanted that your mo@@ m said that you couldn &apos;t have .
I get all the good stuff and n@@ one of the bad .
"So , what is the social resul@@ t of this ?"
"The social resul@@ t is that today &apos;s Z@@ i@@ p@@ car has 10@@ 0,000 mem@@ bers dri@@ ving 3@@ ,000 cars par@@ ked in 3@@ ,000 par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ es ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad of dri@@ ving 1@@ 2@@ ,000 miles a year , which is what the a@@ ver@@ age city dw@@ el@@ ler does , they dri@@ ve 500 miles a year . A@@ re they happy ?"
"The company has been d@@ ou@@ b@@ ling in size ever since I f@@ oun@@ ded it , or gre@@ ater ."
"P@@ e@@ ople ad@@ ore the company . And it &apos;s better , you know ? They like it ."
"So , how is it that people went from the 1@@ 2@@ ,000 miles a year to 500 miles ?"
"It &apos;s because they said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s eight to 10 dollars an hour and 6@@ 5 dollars a day ."
"If I &apos;m going to go bu@@ y some ice cre@@ am , do I really want to spend eight dollars to go bu@@ y the ice cre@@ am ? O@@ r maybe I &apos;ll do without ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe I would have b@@ ou@@ ght the ice cre@@ am when I did some other er@@ r@@ and . &quot; &quot; So , people really re@@ spo@@ nd very quickly to it , to pri@@ ces ."
And the last point I want to make is Z@@ i@@ p@@ car would never be possible without technology .
"It requi@@ red that it was completely tri@@ vi@@ al : that it takes 30 secon@@ ds to re@@ ser@@ ve a car , go get it , dri@@ ve it ."
"And for me , as a ser@@ vice provi@@ der , I would never be able to provi@@ de you a car for an hour if the trans@@ action cost was anything ."
"So , without these wi@@ rel@@ ess technolog@@ ies , this , as a con@@ cept , could never happen ."
"So , here &apos;s another example . This company is Go@@ L@@ o@@ co — I &apos;m la@@ un@@ ching it in about three weeks — and I hope to do for ri@@ des@@ har@@ ing what I did for car sh@@ aring ."
This will app@@ ly to people across all of America .
"T@@ od@@ ay , 7@@ 5 percent of the tri@@ ps are sing@@ le@@ -@@ oc@@ cu@@ pan@@ cy ve@@ hi@@ cles , yet 12 percent of tri@@ ps to work are cur@@ r@@ ently car@@ po@@ ol ."
And I think that we can app@@ ly social net@@ works and on@@ line pa@@ y@@ ment systems to completely change how people feel about ri@@ des@@ har@@ ing and make that tri@@ p much more ef@@ fi@@ cient .
"And so when I think about the future , people will be thinking that sh@@ aring the ri@@ de with someone is this incredi@@ bly great social ev@@ ent out of their day ."
"You know , how did you get to TED ? You went with other TE@@ D@@ st@@ ers ."
How f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous . Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car ?
"H@@ ow did you go food sh@@ op@@ ping ? You went with your neigh@@ b@@ or , what a great social time ."
"You know it &apos;s going to really trans@@ form how we feel about tra@@ vel , and it will also , I think , en@@ h@@ ance our fre@@ e@@ dom of mo@@ bility ."
W@@ here can I go today and who can I do it with ?
Th@@ ose are the typ@@ es of things that you will look at and feel .
"And the social b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts : the r@@ ate of sing@@ le@@ -@@ oc@@ cu@@ pan@@ cy ve@@ hi@@ cles is , I told you , 7@@ 5 percent ; I think we can get that down to 50 percent ."
"The de@@ m@@ and for par@@ king , of course , is down , con@@ g@@ esti@@ on and the C@@ O@@ 2 e@@ mis@@ sions ."
"One last piece about this , of course , is that it &apos;s en@@ ab@@ led by wi@@ rel@@ ess technolog@@ ies ."
And it &apos;s the cost of dri@@ ving that &apos;s making people want to be able to do this .
"The a@@ ver@@ age American sp@@ en@@ ds 1@@ 9 percent of their in@@ come on their car , and there &apos;s a pres@@ sure for them to redu@@ ce that cost , yet they have no out@@ let today ."
"So , the last example of this is con@@ g@@ esti@@ on pri@@ cing , very fam@@ ously done in Lon@@ don ."
It &apos;s when you char@@ ge a pre@@ mi@@ um for people to dri@@ ve on con@@ g@@ est@@ ed ro@@ ads .
"In Lon@@ don , the day they turned the con@@ g@@ esti@@ on pri@@ cing on , there was a 25 percent de@@ cre@@ ase in con@@ g@@ esti@@ on over@@ night , and that &apos;s per@@ si@@ st@@ ed for the four years in which they &apos;ve been doing con@@ g@@ esti@@ on pri@@ cing ."
"And again , do people like the out@@ come ?"
K@@ en Li@@ v@@ ing@@ st@@ one was re@@ ele@@ cted .
"So again , we can see that pri@@ ce pla@@ ys an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous ro@@ le in people &apos;s wil@@ lin@@ g@@ ness to redu@@ ce their dri@@ ving behavi@@ or ."
We &apos;ve tri@@ p@@ led the miles that we dri@@ ve since 19@@ 70 and d@@ ou@@ b@@ led them since 19@@ 8@@ 2 .
There &apos;s a huge sl@@ ack in that system ; with the right pri@@ cing we can un@@ do that .
"C@@ on@@ g@@ esti@@ on pri@@ cing is being di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed in every major city around the world and is , again , wi@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly en@@ ab@@ led ."
You wer@@ en &apos;t going to put t@@ ol@@ l@@ boo@@ ths around the city of Lon@@ don and open and sh@@ u@@ t those g@@ ates .
And what con@@ g@@ esti@@ on pri@@ cing is is that it &apos;s a technology tri@@ al and a psycho@@ logi@@ cal tri@@ al for something called ro@@ ad pri@@ cing .
"And ro@@ ad pri@@ cing is where we &apos;re all going to have to go , because today we pay for our ma@@ inten@@ ance and we@@ ar and te@@ ar on our cars with gas ta@@ x@@ es ."
"And as we get our cars more fu@@ el@@ -@@ ef@@ fi@@ cient , that &apos;s going to be redu@@ cing the amount of re@@ ven@@ ue that you get off of those gas ta@@ x@@ es , so we need to char@@ ge people by the mi@@ le that they dri@@ ve ."
Wh@@ atever happens with con@@ g@@ esti@@ on pri@@ cing and those technolog@@ ies will be happening with ro@@ ad pri@@ cing .
Why do we tra@@ vel too much ?
C@@ ar tra@@ vel is under@@ pri@@ ced and ther@@ e@@ fore we over@@ -@@ con@@ sum@@ ed .
We need to put this better market fe@@ ed@@ back .
"And if we have it , you &apos;ll deci@@ de how many miles to dri@@ ve , what mo@@ de of tra@@ vel , where to live and work ."
And wi@@ rel@@ ess technolog@@ ies make this re@@ al@@ -@@ time loo@@ p possible .
"So , I want to move now to the second part of my story , which is : when are we going to start doing this con@@ g@@ esti@@ on pri@@ cing ? Ro@@ ad pri@@ cing is coming ."
When are we going to do it ? A@@ re we going to wa@@ it 10 to 15 years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this poli@@ tical will to make it happen in the next two years ?
"Because I &apos;m going to say , that is going to be the to@@ ol that &apos;s going to turn our us@@ age over@@ night ."
And what kind of wi@@ rel@@ ess technology are we going to use ?
This is my big vision .
"There is a to@@ ol that can help us bri@@ dge the di@@ gi@@ tal di@@ vi@@ de , re@@ spo@@ nd to em@@ er@@ gen@@ cies , get traf@@ fic moving , provi@@ de a new eng@@ ine for economic grow@@ th and dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally redu@@ ce C@@ O@@ 2 e@@ mis@@ sions in every se@@ ctor ."
And this is a moment from &quot; &quot; The G@@ ra@@ du@@ ate . &quot; &quot; Do you remember this moment ?
You guys are going to be the hand@@ some young guy and I &apos;m going to be the wi@@ se bus@@ in@@ ess@@ man .
"&quot; I want to say one word to you , just one word . &quot;"
"&quot; Yes , si@@ r ? &quot; &quot; A@@ re you list@@ ening ? &quot; &quot; Yes I am . &quot;"
&quot; A@@ d-@@ ho@@ c pe@@ er@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ pe@@ er self-@@ con@@ fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing wi@@ rel@@ ess net@@ works . &quot;
( Laughter ) These are also called m@@ es@@ h net@@ works .
"And in a m@@ es@@ h , every de@@ vice con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes to and ex@@ p@@ ands the network , and I think you might have heard a little bit about it before ."
I &apos;m going to give you some exam@@ ples .
You &apos;ll be hear@@ ing later today from Al@@ an K@@ ay .
"These lap@@ top@@ s , when a child open@@ s them up , they communi@@ cate with every single child in the clas@@ s@@ room , within that school , within that vi@@ ll@@ age ."
And what is the cost of that communi@@ cation system ?
Z@@ er@@ o dollars a mon@@ th .
"H@@ ere &apos;s another example : in New O@@ r@@ le@@ ans , video cam@@ er@@ as were m@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ en@@ ab@@ led so that they could mon@@ it@@ or cri@@ me in the dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n F@@ ren@@ ch Q@@ u@@ ar@@ ter ."
"When the h@@ ur@@ ri@@ c@@ ane happened , the only communi@@ cation system standing was the m@@ es@@ h network ."
"@@ V@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers f@@ le@@ w in , ad@@ ded a whole bu@@ n@@ ch of de@@ vi@@ ces , and for the next 12 months , m@@ es@@ h net@@ works were the only wi@@ rel@@ ess that was happening in New O@@ r@@ le@@ ans ."
"A@@ no@@ ther example is in P@@ or@@ t@@ s@@ m@@ outh , U.@@ K@@ ."
They m@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ en@@ ab@@ led 3@@ 00 bus@@ es and they speak to these s@@ mar@@ t ter@@ min@@ als .
"You can look at the ter@@ min@@ al and be able to see pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly where your bu@@ s is on the stre@@ et and when it &apos;s coming , and you can bu@@ y your ti@@ c@@ ke@@ ts in real time ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , all m@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ en@@ ab@@ led . M@@ on@@ th@@ ly communi@@ cation cost : zer@@ o ."
"So , the beau@@ ty of m@@ es@@ h net@@ works : you can have these very low@@ -@@ cost de@@ vi@@ ces ."
"Z@@ er@@ o on@@ going communi@@ cation co@@ sts . H@@ igh@@ ly sc@@ al@@ able ; you can just keep ad@@ ding them , and as in K@@ at@@ r@@ ina , you can keep sub@@ trac@@ ting them — as long as there &apos;s some , we can still communi@@ cate ."
They &apos;re re@@ sil@@ ien@@ t ; their re@@ d@@ un@@ dan@@ cy is built into this f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous de@@ cen@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed design .
What are the incredible we@@ ak@@ n@@ ess@@ es ?
"There isn &apos;t any@@ body in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton lob@@ by@@ ing to make it happen — or in those muni@@ ci@@ p@@ ali@@ ties , to build out their cities with these wi@@ rel@@ ess net@@ works — because there &apos;s zer@@ o on@@ going communi@@ c@@ ations cost ."
"So , the exam@@ ples that I gave you are these is@@ l@@ ands of m@@ es@@ h net@@ works , and net@@ works are interesting only as they are big ."
How do we create a big network ?
A@@ re you guys ready again — &quot; &quot; The G@@ ra@@ du@@ ate &quot; &quot; ?
"This time you will still play the hand@@ some young thing , but I &apos;ll be the se@@ x@@ y woman ."
These are the next two lin@@ es in the movie .
&quot; W@@ here did you do it ? &quot; &quot; In his car . &quot;
"So you know , when you sti@@ ck this idea ... ( Laughter ) where would we expe@@ ct me , Rob@@ in C@@ ha@@ se , to be thinking is imagine if we put a m@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ network de@@ vice in every single car across America ."
"We could have a co@@ ast@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ co@@ ast , f@@ ree wi@@ rel@@ ess communi@@ cation system ."
I gu@@ ess I just want you to think about that .
"And why is this going to happen ? Because we &apos;re going to do con@@ g@@ esti@@ on pri@@ cing , we are going to do ro@@ ad t@@ ol@@ ls , gas ta@@ x@@ es are going to become ro@@ ad pri@@ cing ."
These things are going to happen .
What &apos;s the wi@@ rel@@ ess technology we &apos;re going to use ?
Ma@@ ybe we should use a good one . When are we going to do it ?
Ma@@ ybe we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t wa@@ it for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen .
We should pu@@ ll it forward .
"So , I &apos;d like us to la@@ un@@ ch the wi@@ rel@@ ess Inter@@ net inter@@ state wi@@ rel@@ ess m@@ es@@ h system , and requi@@ re that this network be ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble to everyone , with open stan@@ dar@@ ds ."
"R@@ ight now in the transpor@@ tation se@@ ctor , we &apos;re cre@@ ating these wi@@ rel@@ ess de@@ vi@@ ces — I gu@@ ess you guys might have F@@ ast P@@ as@@ s here or E@@ asy L@@ ane — that are sing@@ le@@ -@@ pur@@ pos@@ e de@@ vi@@ ces in these clo@@ sed net@@ works ."
What is the point ?
"We &apos;re trans@@ fer@@ ring just a few little data bi@@ ts when we &apos;re doing ro@@ ad contro@@ l@@ ling , ro@@ ad pri@@ cing ."
We have this incredible ex@@ cess ca@@ pac@@ ity .
"So , we can provi@@ de the low@@ est@@ -@@ cost means of going wi@@ rel@@ ess co@@ ast@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ co@@ ast , we can have re@@ sil@@ ien@@ t n@@ ati@@ on@@ wi@@ de communi@@ cation systems , we have a new to@@ ol for cre@@ ating ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ cies in all se@@ ct@@ ors ."
I@@ mag@@ ine what happens when the cost of getting information from any@@ where to any@@ where is close to zer@@ o .
What you can do with that to@@ ol : we can create an economic eng@@ ine .
"In@@ form@@ ation should be f@@ ree , and ac@@ cess to information should be f@@ ree , and we should be char@@ g@@ ing people for car@@ b@@ on ."
"I think this is a more powerful to@@ ol than the Inter@@ state H@@ igh@@ way A@@ ct , and I think this is as important and world chang@@ ing to our econom@@ y as electri@@ fi@@ cation ."
"And if I had my dru@@ thers , we would have an open@@ -@@ source ver@@ sion in ad@@ di@@ tion to open stan@@ dar@@ ds ."
And this open@@ -@@ source ver@@ sion means that it could be — if we did a bri@@ lli@@ ant job of it — it could be used around the world very quickly .
"So , going back to one of my ear@@ lie@@ r thou@@ ghts ."
I@@ mag@@ ine if every one of these bus@@ es in L@@ a@@ go@@ s was part of the m@@ es@@ h network .
"When I went this morning to L@@ ar@@ ry Bri@@ lli@@ ant &apos;s TE@@ D@@ T@@ al@@ k pri@@ ze — his f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous net@@ works — imagine if there was an open@@ -@@ source m@@ es@@ h communi@@ c@@ ations de@@ vice that can be put into those net@@ works , to make all that happen ."
And we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that this little sli@@ ce of things is going to be for f@@ ree .
"We could make bi@@ llions of dollars on top of it , but this one particular sli@@ ce of communi@@ c@@ ations needs to be open source ."
"So , let &apos;s take control of this ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are : im@@ ple@@ ment a gas ta@@ x im@@ medi@@ ately ; tran@@ si@@ tion across the n@@ ation to ro@@ ad@@ -@@ t@@ ol@@ ling with this wi@@ rel@@ ess m@@ es@@ h ; requi@@ re that the m@@ es@@ h be open to all , with open stan@@ dar@@ ds ; and , of course , use m@@ es@@ h net@@ works ."
Thank you . ( Applause )
"And in this case , a man got ho@@ o@@ ked on a b@@ am@@ bo@@ o sle@@ e@@ ping m@@ at ."
"And last but not least , it is an ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion ."
But my most important question was always the same .
"In shor@@ t , we &apos;re really moving forward to the past ."
"We are — in the words of T@@ ed H@@ u@@ gh@@ es , &quot; I think that we are like two fe@@ et . We need each other to get a@@ head . &quot;"
And we &apos;re fin@@ ding more and more gen@@ der differ@@ ences in the brain .
We si@@ t around it and it sha@@ p@@ es our min@@ ds .
"We now know the brain cir@@ cu@@ i@@ try of imag@@ in@@ ation , of lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m plan@@ ning ."
And there &apos;s also many more m@@ ale i@@ di@@ ots in the world .
So we &apos;re seeing there &apos;s a real ex@@ ten@@ sion of mi@@ ddle age .
"And as it turns out , the ol@@ der you get , the less li@@ ke@@ ly you are to di@@ v@@ or@@ ce ."
So I want to con@@ clu@@ de with two things .
She &apos;s 2@@ 3 . She &apos;s been on them ever since she was 1@@ 3 .
I &apos;m just simply saying that a world without love is a de@@ ad@@ ly place .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m now con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ting to this .
I &apos;ve been car@@ ry@@ ing on here about the bio@@ logy of love .
That &apos;s where we put our people in the M@@ R@@ I mach@@ ine .
"I want to ask you all to consi@@ der for a second the very simple fact that , by far , most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light ."
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sk@@ y and see star@@ s with our b@@ are eyes .
The Su@@ n bur@@ ns our per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al vision .
We see light ref@@ le@@ cted off the Mo@@ on .
"And in the time since G@@ ali@@ le@@ o poin@@ ted that ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e at the ce@@ le@@ sti@@ al bod@@ ies , the known universe has come to us through light , across v@@ ast er@@ as in co@@ smi@@ c history ."
"And with all of our moder@@ n tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , we &apos;ve been able to colle@@ ct this st@@ un@@ ning sil@@ ent movie of the universe — these ser@@ ies of s@@ na@@ p@@ sh@@ ots that go all the way back to the Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g ."
"And yet , the universe is not a sil@@ ent movie because the universe isn &apos;t sil@@ ent ."
"I &apos;d like to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you that the universe has a soun@@ d@@ tr@@ ack and that soun@@ d@@ tr@@ ack is pla@@ yed on space itself , because space can w@@ ob@@ ble like a dru@@ m ."
It can ring out a kind of recor@@ ding throu@@ gh@@ out the universe of some of the most dra@@ m@@ atic ev@@ ents as they un@@ f@@ old .
Now we &apos;d like to be able to ad@@ d to a kind of gl@@ ori@@ ous vi@@ su@@ al com@@ posi@@ tion that we have of the universe — a son@@ ic com@@ posi@@ tion .
"And while we &apos;ve never heard the sounds from space , we really should , in the next few years , start to turn up the v@@ olu@@ me on what &apos;s going on out there ."
"So in this am@@ bi@@ tion to cap@@ ture son@@ gs from the universe , we turn our fo@@ cus to black ho@@ les and the pro@@ mi@@ se they have , because black ho@@ les can ban@@ g on sp@@ ace@@ -@@ time like mal@@ le@@ ts on a dru@@ m and have a very char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ stic s@@ ong , which I &apos;d like to play for you — some of our pre@@ di@@ ctions for what that s@@ ong will be like ."
Now black ho@@ les are dar@@ k against a dar@@ k sk@@ y .
We can &apos;t see them dire@@ ct@@ ly .
"They &apos;re not brought to us with light , at least not dire@@ ct@@ ly ."
"We can see them indi@@ re@@ ct@@ ly , because black ho@@ les w@@ re@@ ak ha@@ vo@@ c on their environment ."
They de@@ stro@@ y star@@ s around them .
They ch@@ ur@@ n up de@@ br@@ is in their sur@@ ro@@ un@@ dings .
But they won &apos;t come to us dire@@ ct@@ ly through light .
"We might one day see a sha@@ do@@ w a black ho@@ le can c@@ ast on a very b@@ right back@@ ground , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t yet ."
"And yet black ho@@ les may be heard even if they &apos;re not seen , and that &apos;s because they ban@@ g on sp@@ ace@@ -@@ time like a dru@@ m ."
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a dru@@ m to Al@@ ber@@ t E@@ inste@@ in — to wh@@ om we owe so much .
"E@@ inste@@ in realized that if space were em@@ p@@ ty , if the universe were em@@ p@@ ty , it would be like this picture , ex@@ cept for maybe without the hel@@ p@@ ful g@@ ri@@ d d@@ raw@@ n on it ."
"But if we were fre@@ ely fal@@ ling through the space , even without this hel@@ p@@ ful g@@ ri@@ d , we might be able to pa@@ int it ourselves , because we would noti@@ ce that we tra@@ ve@@ led along stra@@ ight lin@@ es , un@@ def@@ le@@ cted stra@@ ight pa@@ ths through the universe ."
"E@@ inste@@ in also realized — and this is the real me@@ at of the matter — that if you put energy or mas@@ s in the universe , it would cur@@ ve space , and a fre@@ ely fal@@ ling obje@@ ct would pas@@ s by , let &apos;s say , the Su@@ n and it would be def@@ le@@ cted along the natural cur@@ ves in the space ."
It was E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s great gener@@ al the@@ ory of relati@@ vity .
Now even light will be b@@ ent by those pa@@ ths .
"And you can be b@@ ent so much that you &apos;re ca@@ u@@ ght in or@@ bit around the Su@@ n , as the Earth is , or the Mo@@ on around the Earth ."
These are the natural cur@@ ves in space .
"What E@@ inste@@ in did not realize was that , if you took our Su@@ n and you c@@ rus@@ h@@ ed it down to six kilome@@ ters — so you took a million times the mas@@ s of the Earth and you c@@ rus@@ h@@ ed it to six kilome@@ ters across , you would make a black ho@@ le , an obje@@ ct so den@@ se that if light ve@@ er@@ ed too close , it would never es@@ cape — a dar@@ k sha@@ do@@ w against the universe ."
"It wasn &apos;t E@@ inste@@ in who realized this , it was K@@ ar@@ l S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child who was a G@@ er@@ man Je@@ w in World W@@ ar I — jo@@ ined the G@@ er@@ man ar@@ my already an ac@@ comp@@ li@@ shed scienti@@ st , working on the R@@ us@@ si@@ an front ."
"I like to imagine S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child in the war in the tr@@ en@@ ch@@ es cal@@ cu@@ lat@@ ing bal@@ li@@ stic tra@@ je@@ ct@@ or@@ ies for can@@ n@@ on fi@@ re , and then , in between , cal@@ cu@@ lat@@ ing E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s equ@@ ations — as you do in the tr@@ en@@ ch@@ es ."
"And he was re@@ ading E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s re@@ cent@@ ly publi@@ shed gener@@ al the@@ ory of relati@@ vity , and he was th@@ ri@@ l@@ led by this the@@ ory ."
"And he quickly sur@@ mis@@ ed an ex@@ act ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal solution that descri@@ bed something very ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary : cur@@ ves so stron@@ g that space would ra@@ in down into them , space itself would cur@@ ve like a wat@@ er@@ f@@ all f@@ low@@ ing down the th@@ ro@@ at of a ho@@ le ."
And even light could not es@@ cape this cur@@ r@@ ent .
"L@@ ight would be dra@@ gg@@ ed down the ho@@ le as everything else would be , and all that would be left would be a sha@@ do@@ w ."
"Now he wro@@ te to E@@ inste@@ in , and he said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s you will see , the war has been kind to me enough ."
"D@@ es@@ pi@@ te the he@@ av@@ y g@@ un@@ fi@@ re , I &apos;ve been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas . &quot; &quot; And E@@ inste@@ in was very im@@ pres@@ sed with his ex@@ act solution , and I should hope also the de@@ di@@ cation of the scienti@@ st ."
This is the har@@ d@@ working scienti@@ st under har@@ sh con@@ di@@ tions .
And he took S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child &apos;s idea to the P@@ rus@@ si@@ an A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of S@@ cien@@ ces the next week .
But E@@ inste@@ in always thought black ho@@ les were a ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal od@@ di@@ ty .
He did not believe they ex@@ ist@@ ed in nature .
He thought nature would prote@@ ct us from their form@@ ation .
It was de@@ ca@@ des before the ter@@ m &quot; &quot; black ho@@ le &quot; &quot; was co@@ ined and people realized that black ho@@ les are real ast@@ ro@@ physi@@ cal obje@@ cts — in fact they &apos;re the death state of very mas@@ sive star@@ s that col@@ lap@@ se cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ hi@@ cally at the end of their li@@ fe@@ time .
Now our Su@@ n will not col@@ lap@@ se to a black ho@@ le .
It &apos;s actually not mas@@ sive enough .
"But if we did a little thought experim@@ ent — as E@@ inste@@ in was very f@@ ond of doing — we could imagine pu@@ tting the Su@@ n c@@ rus@@ h@@ ed down to six kilome@@ ters , and pu@@ tting a t@@ iny little Earth around it in or@@ bit , maybe 30 kilome@@ ters outside of the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ ho@@ le su@@ n ."
"And it would be self-@@ il@@ lu@@ min@@ ated , because now the Su@@ n &apos;s gone , we have no other source of light — so let &apos;s make our little Earth self-@@ il@@ lu@@ min@@ ated ."
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy or@@ bit even 30 km outside of this c@@ rus@@ h@@ ed black ho@@ le .
"This c@@ rus@@ h@@ ed black ho@@ le actually would f@@ it inside M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an , more or less ."
It might spi@@ ll off into the H@@ ud@@ son a little bit before it de@@ stro@@ yed the Earth .
But basically that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
We &apos;re talking about an obje@@ ct that you could c@@ rus@@ h down to half the squ@@ are area of M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an .
So we move this Earth very close — 30 kilome@@ ters outside — and we noti@@ ce it &apos;s perfe@@ ct@@ ly f@@ ine or@@ bi@@ ting around the black ho@@ le .
"There &apos;s a sort of my@@ th that black ho@@ les de@@ v@@ our everything in the universe , but you actually have to get very close to f@@ all in ."
"But what &apos;s very im@@ pres@@ sive is that , from our v@@ an@@ t@@ age point , we can always see the Earth ."
It cannot hi@@ de behind the black ho@@ le .
"The light from the Earth , some of it fal@@ ls in , but some of it gets len@@ sed around and brought back to us ."
So you can &apos;t hi@@ de anything behind a black ho@@ le .
"If this were B@@ att@@ le@@ st@@ ar G@@ al@@ acti@@ ca and you &apos;re fi@@ gh@@ ting the C@@ y@@ l@@ ons , don &apos;t hi@@ de behind the black ho@@ le ."
They can see you .
"Now , our Su@@ n will not col@@ lap@@ se to a black ho@@ le — it &apos;s not mas@@ sive enough — but there are ten@@ s of thousands of black ho@@ les in our gal@@ ax@@ y ."
"And if one were to e@@ cli@@ p@@ se the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , this is what it would look like ."
We would see a sha@@ do@@ w of that black ho@@ le against the hundre@@ d billion star@@ s in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y and its lu@@ min@@ ous d@@ ust lan@@ es .
"And if we were to f@@ all towar@@ ds this black ho@@ le , we would see all of that light len@@ sed around it , and we could even start to c@@ ross into that sha@@ do@@ w and really not noti@@ ce that anything dra@@ m@@ atic had happened ."
"It would be bad if we tr@@ ied to fi@@ re our ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts and get out of there because we couldn &apos;t , any@@ more than light can es@@ cape ."
"But even though the black ho@@ le is dar@@ k from the outside , it &apos;s not dar@@ k on the inside , because all of the light from the gal@@ ax@@ y can f@@ all in behind us ."
"And even though , du@@ e to a relati@@ vi@@ stic effe@@ ct known as time di@@ l@@ ation , our clo@@ cks would se@@ em to s@@ low down rel@@ ative to gal@@ ac@@ tic time , it would look as though the ev@@ olution of the gal@@ ax@@ y had been sp@@ ed up and sh@@ ot at us , right before we were c@@ rus@@ h@@ ed to death by the black ho@@ le ."
"It would be like a ne@@ ar@@ -@@ death experience where you see the light at the end of the tu@@ n@@ ne@@ l , but it &apos;s a tot@@ al death experience ."
( Laughter ) And there &apos;s no way of tel@@ ling any@@ body about the light at the end of the tu@@ n@@ ne@@ l .
"Now we &apos;ve never seen a sha@@ do@@ w like this of a black ho@@ le , but black ho@@ les can be heard , even if they &apos;re not seen ."
I@@ mag@@ ine now taking an ast@@ ro@@ physi@@ cally reali@@ stic situ@@ ation — imagine two black ho@@ les that have li@@ ved a long life together .
Ma@@ ybe they started as star@@ s and col@@ lap@@ sed to two black ho@@ les — each one 10 times the mas@@ s of the Su@@ n .
So now we &apos;re going to c@@ rus@@ h them down to 60 kilome@@ ters across .
They can be sp@@ in@@ ning hundre@@ ds of times a second .
"A@@ t the end of their lives , they &apos;re going around each other very ne@@ ar the speed of light ."
"So they &apos;re cro@@ s@@ sing thousands of kilome@@ ters in a f@@ rac@@ tion of a second , and as they do so , they not only cur@@ ve space , but they leave behind in their wa@@ ke a r@@ ing@@ ing of space , an ac@@ tu@@ al wa@@ ve on sp@@ ace@@ -@@ time ."
S@@ p@@ ace squ@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ es and stre@@ t@@ ch@@ es as it em@@ an@@ ates out from these black ho@@ les b@@ ang@@ ing on the universe .
And they tra@@ vel out into the co@@ smo@@ s at the speed of light .
This computer si@@ mul@@ ation is du@@ e to a relati@@ vity group at N@@ A@@ SA G@@ od@@ d@@ ard .
It took almost 30 years for any@@ one in the world to c@@ rac@@ k this problem .
This was one of the grou@@ ps .
"It shows two black ho@@ les in or@@ bit around each other , again , with these hel@@ p@@ fully pain@@ ted cur@@ ves ."
"And if you can see — it &apos;s kind of fa@@ int — but if you can see the red wa@@ ves em@@ an@@ ating out , those are the gra@@ vi@@ t@@ ational wa@@ ves ."
"They &apos;re liter@@ ally the sounds of space r@@ ing@@ ing , and they will tra@@ vel out from these black ho@@ les at the speed of light as they ring down and co@@ al@@ es@@ ce to one sp@@ in@@ ning , qu@@ ie@@ t black ho@@ le at the end of the day ."
"If you were standing ne@@ ar enough , your e@@ ar would re@@ son@@ ate with the squ@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ ing and stre@@ t@@ ching of space ."
You would liter@@ ally hear the sound .
"Now of course , your head would be squ@@ e@@ e@@ zed and stre@@ t@@ ched un@@ hel@@ p@@ fully , so you might have t@@ rou@@ ble under@@ standing what &apos;s going on ."
But I &apos;d like to play for you the sound that we pre@@ di@@ ct .
This is from my group — a sli@@ gh@@ tly less g@@ la@@ mo@@ rou@@ s computer mode@@ ling .
I@@ mag@@ ine a li@@ gh@@ ter black ho@@ le fal@@ ling into a very he@@ av@@ y black ho@@ le .
The sound you &apos;re hear@@ ing is the light black ho@@ le b@@ ang@@ ing on space each time it gets close .
"If it gets far away , it &apos;s a little too qu@@ ie@@ t ."
"But it comes in like a mal@@ let , and it liter@@ ally c@@ rac@@ ks space , w@@ ob@@ b@@ ling it like a dru@@ m ."
And we can pre@@ di@@ ct what the sound will be .
"We know that , as it fal@@ ls in , it gets f@@ ast@@ er and it gets l@@ ou@@ der ."
"And ev@@ en@@ tually , we &apos;re going to hear the little guy just f@@ all into the bi@@ g@@ ger guy ."
( Th@@ um@@ ping ) Th@@ en it &apos;s gone .
Now I &apos;ve never heard it that l@@ ou@@ d — it &apos;s actually more dra@@ m@@ atic .
A@@ t home it sounds kind of anti@@ clim@@ ac@@ tic .
"It &apos;s sort of like ding , ding , ding ."
This is another sound from my group .
"No , I &apos;m not show@@ ing you any images , because black ho@@ les don &apos;t leave behind hel@@ p@@ ful tra@@ il@@ s of in@@ k , and space is not pain@@ ted , show@@ ing you the cur@@ ves ."
"But if you were to flo@@ at by in space on a space ho@@ li@@ day and you heard this , you want to get moving ."
( Laughter ) W@@ ant to get away from the sound .
B@@ ot@@ h black ho@@ les are moving .
B@@ ot@@ h black ho@@ les are getting clo@@ s@@ er together .
"In this case , they &apos;re both w@@ ob@@ b@@ ling quite a lot ."
And then they &apos;re going to mer@@ ge .
( Th@@ um@@ ping ) Now it &apos;s gone .
Now that ch@@ ir@@ p is very char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ stic of black ho@@ les mer@@ g@@ ing — that it ch@@ ir@@ ps up at the end .
Now that &apos;s our pre@@ di@@ ction for what we &apos;ll see .
"Lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly we &apos;re at this sa@@ fe di@@ stance in L@@ ong Be@@ ach , C@@ alifor@@ nia ."
"And su@@ re@@ ly , some@@ where in the universe two black ho@@ les have mer@@ g@@ ed ."
"And su@@ re@@ ly , the space around us is r@@ ing@@ ing after tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing maybe a million light years , or a million years , at the speed of light to get to us ."
But the sound is too qu@@ ie@@ t for any of us to ever hear .
There are very indu@@ stri@@ ous experim@@ ents being built on Earth — one called L@@ I@@ G@@ O — which will de@@ te@@ ct de@@ vi@@ ations in the squ@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ ing and stre@@ t@@ ching of space at less than the f@@ rac@@ tion of a nu@@ cle@@ us of an at@@ om over four kilome@@ ters .
"It &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ ably am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous experim@@ ent , and it &apos;s going to be at adv@@ an@@ ced sen@@ si@@ ti@@ vity within the next few years — to pi@@ ck this up ."
"There &apos;s also a mis@@ sion pro@@ posed for space , which hop@@ e@@ fully will la@@ un@@ ch in the next ten years , called L@@ I@@ SA ."
And L@@ I@@ SA will be able to see super@@ -@@ mas@@ sive black ho@@ les — black ho@@ les mi@@ llions or bi@@ llions of times the mas@@ s of the Su@@ n .
"In this H@@ u@@ b@@ ble image , we see two gal@@ ax@@ ies ."
They look like they &apos;re f@@ roz@@ en in some em@@ brac@@ e .
And each one probably har@@ b@@ ors a super@@ -@@ mas@@ sive black ho@@ le at its cor@@ e .
But they &apos;re not f@@ roz@@ en ; they &apos;re actually mer@@ g@@ ing .
"These two black ho@@ les are col@@ li@@ ding , and they will mer@@ ge over a bi@@ lli@@ on-@@ year time scale ."
It &apos;s be@@ y@@ ond our human per@@ cep@@ tion to pi@@ ck up a s@@ ong of that du@@ r@@ ation .
"But L@@ I@@ SA could see the fin@@ al st@@ ages of two super@@ -@@ mas@@ sive black ho@@ les ear@@ lie@@ r in the universe &apos;s history , the last 15 minutes before they f@@ all together ."
"And it &apos;s not just black ho@@ les , but it &apos;s also any big di@@ st@@ urb@@ ance in the universe — and the bi@@ ggest of them all is the Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g ."
"When that ex@@ pres@@ sion was co@@ ined , it was der@@ i@@ sive — like , &quot; &quot; Oh , who would believe in a Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g ? &quot; &quot; But now it actually might be more techni@@ cally ac@@ cur@@ ate because it might ban@@ g ."
It might make a sound .
This anim@@ ation from my friends at Pro@@ ton S@@ tu@@ di@@ os shows looking at the Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g from the outside .
We don &apos;t ever want to do that actually . We want to be inside the universe because there &apos;s no such thing as standing outside the universe .
So imagine you &apos;re inside the Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g .
"It &apos;s every@@ where , it &apos;s all around you , and the space is w@@ ob@@ b@@ ling cha@@ oti@@ cally ."
F@@ our@@ te@@ en billion years pas@@ s and this s@@ ong is still r@@ ing@@ ing all around us .
"G@@ al@@ ax@@ ies form , and gener@@ ations of star@@ s form in those gal@@ ax@@ ies , and around one st@@ ar , at least one st@@ ar , is a ha@@ bi@@ table planet ."
"And here we are f@@ ran@@ ti@@ cally building these experim@@ ents , doing these cal@@ cul@@ ations , writing these computer co@@ des ."
"I@@ mag@@ ine a billion years ago , two black ho@@ les col@@ li@@ ded ."
That s@@ ong has been r@@ ing@@ ing through space for all that time .
We wer@@ en &apos;t even here .
"It gets clo@@ s@@ er and clo@@ s@@ er — 4@@ 0,000 years ago , we &apos;re still doing ca@@ ve pain@@ t@@ ings ."
"It &apos;s like h@@ ur@@ ry , build your instru@@ ments ."
"It &apos;s getting clo@@ s@@ er and clo@@ s@@ er , and in 20 ..."
"@@ whatever year it will be when our de@@ te@@ ct@@ ors are finally at adv@@ an@@ ced sen@@ si@@ ti@@ vity — we &apos;ll build them , we &apos;ll turn on the mach@@ ines and , ban@@ g , we &apos;ll cat@@ ch it — the first s@@ ong from space ."
"If it was the Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g we were going to pi@@ ck up , it would sound like this ."
( St@@ atic ) It &apos;s a terri@@ ble sound .
It &apos;s liter@@ ally the defini@@ tion of no@@ ise .
It &apos;s white no@@ ise ; it &apos;s such a cha@@ oti@@ c r@@ ing@@ ing .
"But it &apos;s around us every@@ where , pre@@ sum@@ ably , if it ha@@ sn &apos;t been wi@@ ped out by some other process in the universe ."
"And if we pi@@ ck it up , it will be music to our ear@@ s because it will be the qu@@ ie@@ t ech@@ o of that moment of our cre@@ ation , of our obser@@ v@@ able universe ."
"So within the next few years , we &apos;ll be able to turn up the soun@@ d@@ tr@@ ack a little bit , ren@@ der the universe in au@@ di@@ o ."
"But if we de@@ te@@ ct those ear@@ lie@@ st mom@@ ents , it &apos;ll bring us that much clo@@ s@@ er to an under@@ standing of the Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g , which br@@ ings us that much clo@@ s@@ er to as@@ king some of the har@@ d@@ est , most e@@ lu@@ sive , questions ."
"If we run the movie of our universe back@@ war@@ ds , we know that there was a Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g in our past , and we might even hear the c@@ ac@@ op@@ hon@@ ous sound of it , but was our Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g the only Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g ?"
"I mean we have to ask , has it happened before ?"
Wi@@ ll it happen again ?
"I mean , in the sp@@ ir@@ it of ri@@ sing to TED &apos;s challen@@ ge to re@@ ig@@ ni@@ te won@@ der , we can ask questions , at least for this last minu@@ te , that hon@@ est@@ ly might ev@@ ade us fore@@ ver ."
But we have to ask : Is it possible that our universe is just a p@@ lu@@ me off of some gre@@ ater history ?
"O@@ r , is it possible that we &apos;re just a bran@@ ch off of a mul@@ ti@@ verse — each bran@@ ch with its own Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g in its past — maybe some of them with black ho@@ les playing dru@@ ms , maybe some without — maybe some with s@@ ent@@ ien@@ t life , and maybe some without — not in our past , not in our future , but some@@ how fundam@@ ent@@ ally conne@@ cted to us ?"
"So we have to won@@ der , if there is a mul@@ ti@@ verse , in some other pat@@ ch of that mul@@ ti@@ verse , are there cre@@ at@@ ures ?"
Here &apos;s my mul@@ ti@@ verse cre@@ at@@ ures .
"A@@ re there other cre@@ at@@ ures in the mul@@ ti@@ verse , wonder@@ ing about us and wonder@@ ing about their own ori@@ gin@@ s ?"
"And if they are , I can imagine them as we are , cal@@ cu@@ lat@@ ing , writing computer c@@ od@@ e , building instru@@ ments , trying to de@@ te@@ ct that fa@@ inte@@ st sound of their ori@@ gin@@ s and wonder@@ ing who else is out there ."
Thank you . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m actually here to make a challen@@ ge to people .
I know there have been many challen@@ ges made to people .
The one I &apos;m going to make is that it is time for us to re@@ c@@ la@@ im what pe@@ ace really means .
"P@@ e@@ ace is not &quot; &quot; K@@ um@@ ba@@ ya , my L@@ or@@ d . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ ace is not the do@@ ve and the ra@@ in@@ b@@ ow — as lo@@ vely as they are ."
"When I see the sym@@ b@@ ols of the ra@@ in@@ b@@ ow and the do@@ ve , I think of per@@ s@@ onal ser@@ eni@@ ty ."
I think of medi@@ tation .
"I do not think about what I consi@@ der to be pe@@ ace , which is susta@@ in@@ able pe@@ ace with ju@@ sti@@ ce and equ@@ ality ."
"It is a susta@@ in@@ able pe@@ ace in which the maj@@ ori@@ ty of people on this planet have ac@@ cess to enough re@@ sources to live di@@ gni@@ f@@ ied lives , where these people have enough ac@@ cess to education and health care , so that they can live in fre@@ e@@ dom from want and fre@@ e@@ dom from fe@@ ar ."
This is called human secu@@ ri@@ ty .
"And I am not a comple@@ te pac@@ i@@ fi@@ st like some of my really , really he@@ av@@ y@@ -@@ du@@ ty , n@@ on-@@ viol@@ ent friends , like Ma@@ i@@ read M@@ c@@ G@@ u@@ i@@ re ."
"I understand that hum@@ ans are so &quot; &quot; mess@@ ed up &quot; &quot; — to use a nice word , because I pro@@ mis@@ ed my mo@@ m I &apos;d stop using the F@@ -@@ b@@ om@@ b in public ."
And I &apos;m trying har@@ der and har@@ der .
"M@@ om , I &apos;m really trying ."
"We need a little bit of poli@@ ce ; we need a little bit of mi@@ lit@@ ary , but for def@@ en@@ se ."
We need to re@@ def@@ ine what makes us secu@@ re in this world .
It is not ar@@ ming our country to the te@@ e@@ th .
It is not getting other countries to ar@@ m themselves to the te@@ e@@ th with the we@@ apo@@ ns that we produ@@ ce and we se@@ ll them .
"It is using that money more r@@ ati@@ on@@ ally to make the countries of the world secu@@ re , to make the people of the world secu@@ re ."
"I was thinking about the re@@ cent on@@ go@@ ings in Con@@ gre@@ ss , where the pre@@ si@@ dent is of@@ fer@@ ing 8@@ .@@ 4 billion dollars to try to get the S@@ T@@ A@@ R@@ T v@@ ot@@ e ."
I cer@@ tain@@ ly sup@@ port the S@@ T@@ A@@ R@@ T v@@ ot@@ e .
But he &apos;s of@@ fer@@ ing 8@@ 4 billion dollars for the moder@@ ni@@ z@@ ing of nuclear we@@ apo@@ ns .
Do you know the figure that the U.@@ N@@ . tal@@ ks about for fu@@ l@@ fil@@ ling the M@@ il@@ len@@ ni@@ um D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ pment Go@@ als is 80 billion dollars ?
"J@@ ust that little bit of money , which to me , I wi@@ sh it was in my b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t — it &apos;s not , but ..."
"In global terms , it &apos;s a little bit of money ."
"But it &apos;s going to moder@@ ni@@ ze we@@ apo@@ ns we do not need and will not be got@@ ten ri@@ d of in our li@@ fe@@ time , un@@ less we get up off our ..."
"@@ and take action to make it happen , un@@ less we beg@@ in to believe that all of the things that we &apos;ve been hear@@ ing about in these last two days are ele@@ ments of what come together to make human secu@@ ri@@ ty ."
It is sa@@ ving the ti@@ g@@ ers .
It is stop@@ ping the t@@ ar s@@ ands .
It is having ac@@ cess to medi@@ cal e@@ qui@@ pment that can actually tell who does have can@@ cer .
It is all of those things .
It is using our money for all of those things .
It is about action .
"I was in Hi@@ ro@@ sh@@ im@@ a a couple of weeks ago , and H@@ is H@@ ol@@ iness — we &apos;re sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city , and there were about eight of us N@@ obe@@ l l@@ au@@ re@@ ates ."
And he &apos;s a bad guy . He &apos;s like a bad kid in ch@@ ur@@ ch .
"We &apos;re star@@ ing at everybody , wai@@ ting our turn to speak , and he le@@ ans over to me , and he says , &quot; J@@ ody , I &apos;m a Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ st mon@@ k . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , Y@@ our H@@ ol@@ iness ."
"@@ Y@@ our ro@@ be gi@@ ves it away . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; You know that I kind of like medi@@ tation , and I pra@@ y . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s good . That &apos;s good ."
We need that in the world .
"I don &apos;t fol@@ low that , but that &apos;s cool . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; But I have become sk@@ e@@ p@@ tical ."
I do not believe that medi@@ tation and pra@@ y@@ er will change this world .
"I think what we need is action . &quot; &quot; H@@ is H@@ ol@@ iness , in his ro@@ be@@ s , is my new action her@@ o ."
I spo@@ ke with A@@ ung Su@@ n Su@@ u K@@ y@@ i a couple of days ago .
"As most of you know , she &apos;s a her@@ o for de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y in her country , Bu@@ r@@ ma ."
You probably also know that she has spent 15 of the last 20 years im@@ pri@@ son@@ ed for her ef@@ for@@ ts to bring about de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y .
"S@@ he was just rele@@ as@@ ed a couple of weeks ago , and we &apos;re very con@@ cer@@ ned to see how long she will be f@@ ree , because she is already out in the stre@@ ets in R@@ an@@ go@@ on , ag@@ it@@ ating for change ."
"S@@ he is already out in the stre@@ ets , working with the par@@ ty to try to re@@ build it ."
But I tal@@ ked to her for a r@@ ange of issu@@ es .
"But one thing that I want to say , because it &apos;s si@@ mi@@ lar to what H@@ is H@@ ol@@ iness said ."
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; You know , we have a long ro@@ ad to go to finally get de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y in my country ."
But I don &apos;t believe in hope without en@@ de@@ av@@ or .
"I don &apos;t believe in the hope of change , un@@ less we take action to make it so . &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s another woman her@@ o of m@@ ine ."
"S@@ he &apos;s my friend , D@@ r. S@@ hi@@ r@@ in E@@ bad@@ i , the first M@@ us@@ li@@ m woman to re@@ cei@@ ve the N@@ obe@@ l Pe@@ ace P@@ ri@@ ze ."
She has been in ex@@ ile for the last year and a half .
You ask her where she lives — where does she live in ex@@ ile ?
She says the air@@ por@@ ts of the world .
She is tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing because she was out of the country at the time of the ele@@ ctions .
"And instead of going home , she con@@ fer@@ red with all the other women that she works with , who said to her , &quot; &quot; S@@ ta@@ y out . We need you out ."
"We need to be able to talk to you out there , so that you can give the mess@@ age of what &apos;s happening here . &quot; &quot; A year and a half — she &apos;s out spe@@ aking on be@@ half of the other women in her country ."
W@@ ang@@ ar@@ i Ma@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ i — 200@@ 4 Pe@@ ace l@@ au@@ re@@ ate .
"They call her the &quot; &quot; T@@ ree L@@ ady , &quot; &quot; but she &apos;s more than the T@@ ree L@@ ady ."
Wor@@ king for pe@@ ace is very cre@@ ative .
It &apos;s hard work every day .
"When she was plan@@ ting those tre@@ es , I don &apos;t think most people understand that , at the same time , she was using the action of getting people together to pl@@ ant those tre@@ es to talk about how to over@@ come the au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an government in her country ."
Pe@@ ople could not ga@@ ther without getting bu@@ st@@ ed and taken to ja@@ il .
"But if they were together plan@@ ting tre@@ es for the environment , it was o@@ kay — cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"But it &apos;s not just i@@ con@@ ic women like S@@ hi@@ r@@ in , like A@@ ung Su@@ n Su@@ u K@@ y@@ i , like W@@ ang@@ ar@@ i Ma@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ i — it is other women in the world who are also stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing together to change this world ."
"The W@@ om@@ en &apos;s Le@@ ag@@ ue of Bu@@ r@@ ma , 11 individu@@ al organiz@@ ations of Bu@@ r@@ m@@ ese women came together because there &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th in num@@ bers ."
Wor@@ king together is what chang@@ es our world .
"The M@@ il@@ li@@ on S@@ ig@@ natu@@ res C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n of women inside Bu@@ r@@ ma working together to change human ri@@ ghts , to bring de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y to that country ."
"When one is ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed and taken to pri@@ son , another one comes out and jo@@ ins the movement , re@@ cogni@@ z@@ ing that if they work together , they will ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely bring change in their own country ."
"M@@ a@@ i@@ read M@@ c@@ G@@ u@@ i@@ re in the mi@@ ddle , Be@@ t@@ ty W@@ il@@ li@@ am@@ s on the ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side — br@@ ing@@ ing pe@@ ace to Nor@@ ther@@ n I@@ rel@@ and ."
I &apos;ll tell you the qui@@ ck story .
"A@@ n I@@ R@@ A dri@@ ver was sh@@ ot , and his car pl@@ ow@@ ed into people on the side of the stre@@ et ."
There was a mother and three children .
The children were kil@@ led on the spo@@ t .
It was Ma@@ i@@ read &apos;s si@@ ster .
"In@@ ste@@ ad of gi@@ ving in to gr@@ ie@@ f , de@@ pres@@ sion , de@@ fe@@ at in the face of that violence , Ma@@ i@@ read ho@@ o@@ ked up with Be@@ t@@ ty — a sta@@ un@@ ch Pro@@ test@@ ant and a sta@@ un@@ ch C@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c — and they took to the stre@@ ets to say , &quot; &quot; No more violence . &quot; &quot; And they were able to get ten@@ s of thousands of , pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly , women , some men , in the stre@@ ets to bring about change ."
"And they have been part of what brought pe@@ ace to Nor@@ ther@@ n I@@ rel@@ and , and they &apos;re still working on it , because there &apos;s still a lot more to do ."
This is R@@ ig@@ ob@@ er@@ ta M@@ en@@ ch@@ u T@@ um .

"S@@ he is edu@@ c@@ ating the indi@@ gen@@ ous people of her country about what it means to be a de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y , about how you bring de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y to the country , about edu@@ c@@ ating , about how to v@@ ot@@ e — but that de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y is not just about v@@ ot@@ ing ; it &apos;s about being an ac@@ tive ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ."
That &apos;s what I got stu@@ ck doing — the land@@ m@@ ine cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
"One of the things that made this cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n work is because we gre@@ w from two N@@ G@@ O@@ s to thousands in 90 countries around the world , working together in common cause to b@@ an land@@ min@@ es ."
S@@ ome of the people who worked in our cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n could only work maybe an hour a mon@@ th .
They could maybe vol@@ un@@ te@@ er that much .
"There were others , like myself , who were fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time ."
"But it was the ac@@ tions , together , of all of us that brought about that change ."
"In my view , what we need today is people getting up and taking action to re@@ c@@ la@@ im the me@@ an@@ ing of pe@@ ace ."
It &apos;s not a di@@ r@@ ty word .
It &apos;s hard work every single day .
"And if each of us who car@@ es about the different things we care about got up off our bu@@ t@@ ts and vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed as much time as we could , we would change this world , we would sa@@ ve this world ."
And we can &apos;t wa@@ it for the other guy . We have to do it ourselves .

"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I had a pl@@ an , and I never ever thought it would have anything to do with the ban@@ j@@ o ."
L@@ it@@ tle did I know what a huge impac@@ t it would have on me one night when I was at a par@@ ty and I heard a sound coming out of a recor@@ d pla@@ y@@ er in the cor@@ ner of a room .

I think it &apos;ll be a re@@ lie@@ f to some people and a disa@@ p@@ poin@@ t@@ ment to others that I &apos;m not going to talk about v@@ ag@@ in@@ as today .
I began &quot; &quot; The V@@ ag@@ ina M@@ on@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ es &quot; &quot; because I was wor@@ ried about v@@ ag@@ in@@ as .
"I &apos;m very wor@@ ried today about this noti@@ on , this world , this pre@@ v@@ ail@@ ing kind of force of secu@@ ri@@ ty ."
"I see this word , hear this word , feel this word every@@ where ."
"R@@ e@@ al secu@@ ri@@ ty , secu@@ ri@@ ty che@@ cks , secu@@ ri@@ ty wat@@ ch , secu@@ ri@@ ty c@@ lear@@ ance ."
Why has all this fo@@ cus on secu@@ ri@@ ty made me feel so much more in@@ secu@@ re ?
What does any@@ one mean when they talk about real secu@@ ri@@ ty ?
"And why have we , as Ameri@@ cans parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly , become a n@@ ation that stri@@ ves for secu@@ ri@@ ty ab@@ o@@ ve all else ?"
"In fact , I think that secu@@ ri@@ ty is e@@ lu@@ sive . It &apos;s im@@ possible ."
We all die . We all get old . We all get si@@ ck . Pe@@ ople leave us .
Pe@@ ople change us . N@@ o@@ thing is secu@@ re .
And that &apos;s actually the good news .
"This is , of course , un@@ less your whole life is about being secu@@ re ."
"I think that when that is the fo@@ cus of your life , these are the things that happen ."
You can &apos;t tra@@ vel very far or ven@@ ture too far outside a certain cir@@ cle .
"You can &apos;t al@@ low too many con@@ f@@ lic@@ ting ideas into your mind at one time , as they might con@@ f@@ use you or challen@@ ge you ."
"You can &apos;t open yourself to new exper@@ ien@@ ces , new people , new ways of doing things — they might take you off course ."
"You can &apos;t not know who you are , so you c@@ ling to har@@ d-@@ matter iden@@ ti@@ ty ."
"You become a Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an , M@@ us@@ li@@ m , Je@@ w ."
"You &apos;re an Indi@@ an , E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an , I@@ t@@ ali@@ an , American ."
"You &apos;re a he@@ ter@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al or a hom@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al , or you never have se@@ x ."
"O@@ r at least , that &apos;s what you say when you iden@@ ti@@ fy yourself ."
"You become part of an &quot; &quot; us . &quot; &quot; In order to be secu@@ re , you def@@ end against &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; You c@@ ling to your land because it is your secu@@ re place ."
You must fi@@ ght any@@ one who en@@ cro@@ ach@@ es upo@@ n it .
You become your n@@ ation . You become your religi@@ on .
"You become whatever it is that will fre@@ e@@ ze you , num@@ b you and prote@@ ct you from d@@ ou@@ b@@ t or change ."
"But all this does , actually , is sh@@ u@@ t down your mind ."
"In re@@ ality , it does not really make you sa@@ f@@ er ."
"I was in S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ ka , for example , three days after the t@@ su@@ nami , and I was standing on the be@@ ach@@ es and it was absolu@@ tely clear that , in a matter of five minutes , a 3@@ 0-@@ fo@@ ot wa@@ ve could ri@@ se up and des@@ e@@ c@@ r@@ ate a people , a popul@@ ation and lives ."
"A@@ ll this stri@@ ving for secu@@ ri@@ ty , in fact , has made you much more in@@ secu@@ re because now you have to wat@@ ch out all the time ."
There are people not like you — people who you now call ene@@ mie@@ s .
"You have places you cannot go , thou@@ ghts you cannot think , wor@@ l@@ ds that you can no longer in@@ ha@@ bit ."
"And so you spend your days fi@@ gh@@ ting things off , def@@ ending your terri@@ t@@ ory and be@@ coming more en@@ tr@@ en@@ ched in your fundam@@ ent@@ al thinking ."
Y@@ our days become de@@ v@@ ot@@ ed to prote@@ cting yourself .

I@@ de@@ as get shor@@ ter . They become sound by@@ tes .
"There are evi@@ l@@ do@@ ers and sa@@ in@@ ts , cri@@ min@@ als and vi@@ cti@@ ms ."
"There are those who , if they &apos;re not with us , are against us ."
It gets e@@ as@@ ier to h@@ ur@@ t people because you do not feel what &apos;s inside them .
"It gets e@@ as@@ ier to lo@@ ck them up , force them to be na@@ ked , hu@@ mili@@ ate them , oc@@ cu@@ py them , inv@@ ade them and ki@@ ll them , because they are only ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les now to your secu@@ ri@@ ty ."
"In six years , I &apos;ve had the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge through V@@ -@@ D@@ ay , a global movement against &#91; violence against &#93; women , to tra@@ vel probably to 60 countries , and spend a great deal of time in different por@@ tions ."
"I &apos;ve met women and men all over this planet , who through v@@ ari@@ ous cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces — war , po@@ ver@@ ty , rac@@ is@@ m , mul@@ ti@@ ple form@@ s of violence — have never known secu@@ ri@@ ty , or have had their il@@ lu@@ sion of secu@@ ri@@ ty fore@@ ver de@@ v@@ ast@@ ated ."

I &apos;ve been in B@@ os@@ ni@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps .
I was with women in P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an who have had their fac@@ es me@@ l@@ ted off with ac@@ id .
"I &apos;ve been with girls all across America who were d@@ ate@@ -@@ ra@@ ped , or ra@@ ped by their best friends when they were dru@@ gg@@ ed one night ."
One of the amazing things that I &apos;ve disco@@ vered in my tra@@ v@@ els is that there is this em@@ er@@ g@@ ing species .
I lo@@ ved when he was talking about this other world that &apos;s right next to this world .
"I &apos;ve disco@@ vered these people , who , in V@@ -@@ D@@ ay world , we call V@@ ag@@ ina W@@ ar@@ ri@@ ors ."
"These particular people , rather than getting A@@ K@@ -@@ 4@@ 7@@ s , or we@@ apo@@ ns of mas@@ s de@@ stru@@ ction , or m@@ ac@@ he@@ tes , in the sp@@ ir@@ it of the war@@ ri@@ or , have gone into the cen@@ ter , the heart of pa@@ in , of lo@@ ss ."
"They have gr@@ ie@@ ved it , they have d@@ ied into it , and allow@@ ed and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed po@@ is@@ on to turn into medi@@ cine ."
They have used the fu@@ el of their pa@@ in to beg@@ in to re@@ dire@@ ct that energy towar@@ ds another mis@@ sion and another tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory .
These war@@ ri@@ ors now de@@ v@@ ot@@ e themselves and their lives to making sure what happened to them doesn &apos;t happen to any@@ one else .
There are thousands if not mi@@ llions of them on the planet .
I ven@@ ture there are many in this room .
They have a f@@ ier@@ cen@@ ess and a fre@@ e@@ dom that I believe is the be@@ dro@@ ck of a new par@@ ad@@ ig@@ m .
They have bro@@ k@@ en out of the ex@@ ist@@ ing fra@@ me of vi@@ cti@@ m and per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ator .
"Th@@ e@@ ir own per@@ s@@ onal secu@@ ri@@ ty is not their end go@@ al , and because of that , because , rather than wor@@ ry@@ ing about secu@@ ri@@ ty , because the trans@@ form@@ ation of su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing is their end go@@ al , I actually believe they are cre@@ ating real sa@@ fe@@ ty and a whole new idea of secu@@ ri@@ ty ."
I want to talk about a few of these people that I &apos;ve met .
"T@@ om@@ or@@ row , I am going to C@@ air@@ o , and I &apos;m so mo@@ ved that I will be with women in C@@ air@@ o who are V@@ -@@ D@@ ay women , who are open@@ ing the first sa@@ fe house for bat@@ ter@@ ed women in the Mi@@ ddle E@@ ast ."
"That will happen because women in C@@ air@@ o made a deci@@ sion to stand up and put themselves on the line , and talk about the de@@ gre@@ e of violence that is happening in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , and were wil@@ ling to be att@@ ac@@ ked and cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed ."
"And through their work over the last years , this is not only happening that this house is open@@ ing , but it &apos;s being sup@@ por@@ ted by many fac@@ tions of the society who never would have sup@@ por@@ ted it ."
"W@@ om@@ en in U@@ g@@ an@@ da this year , who put on &quot; &quot; The V@@ ag@@ ina M@@ on@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ es &quot; &quot; during V@@ -@@ D@@ ay , actually ev@@ o@@ ked the w@@ rat@@ h of the government ."
"And , I love this story so much ."
There was a c@@ ab@@ in@@ et me@@ e@@ ting and a me@@ e@@ ting of the pre@@ si@@ d@@ ents to talk about whether &quot; &quot; V@@ ag@@ in@@ as &quot; &quot; could come to U@@ g@@ an@@ da .
"And in this me@@ e@@ ting — it went on for weeks in the pre@@ ss , two weeks where there was huge di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
The government finally made a deci@@ sion that &quot; &quot; The V@@ ag@@ ina M@@ on@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ es &quot; &quot; could not be perform@@ ed in U@@ g@@ an@@ da .
"But the amazing news was that because they had sto@@ od up , these women , and because they had been wil@@ ling to ri@@ sk their secu@@ ri@@ ty , it began a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion that not only happened in U@@ g@@ an@@ da , but all of Africa ."
"As a resul@@ t , this produ@@ ction , which had already s@@ old out , every single person in that 8@@ 0@@ 0-@@ se@@ at audience , ex@@ cept for 10 people , made a deci@@ sion to keep the money ."
"They ra@@ is@@ ed 1@@ 0,000 dollars on a produ@@ ction that never oc@@ cur@@ red ."
There &apos;s a young woman na@@ med C@@ ar@@ r@@ ie Re@@ th@@ le@@ f@@ s@@ en in M@@ in@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
She &apos;s a high school stud@@ ent .
"S@@ he had seen &quot; &quot; The V@@ ag@@ ina M@@ on@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ es &quot; &quot; and she was really mo@@ ved . And as a resul@@ t , she wor@@ e an &quot; &quot; I heart my v@@ ag@@ ina &quot; &quot; bu@@ t@@ ton to her high school in M@@ in@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a ."
( Laughter ) She was basically thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to be expe@@ l@@ led from school .
"They told her she couldn &apos;t love her v@@ ag@@ ina in high school , that it was not a leg@@ al thing , that it was not a mor@@ al thing , that it was not a good thing ."
"So she really stru@@ gg@@ led with this , what to do , because she was a s@@ eni@@ or and she was doing well in her school and she was thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed ex@@ pul@@ sion . So what she did is she got all her friends together — I believe it was 100 , 1@@ 50 students all wor@@ e &quot; &quot; I love my v@@ ag@@ ina &quot; &quot; T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts , and the bo@@ ys wor@@ e &quot; &quot; I love her v@@ ag@@ ina &quot; &quot; T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts to school ."
"( Laughter ) Now this seem@@ s like a fa@@ ir@@ ly , you know , f@@ ri@@ vol@@ ous , but what happened as a resul@@ t of that , is that that school now is form@@ ing a se@@ x education clas@@ s . It &apos;s beginning to talk about se@@ x , it &apos;s beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her v@@ ag@@ ina publi@@ c@@ ly or to say that she lo@@ ved her v@@ ag@@ ina publi@@ c@@ ly ."
"I know I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about A@@ gn@@ es here before , but I want to give you an up@@ d@@ ate on A@@ gn@@ es ."
I met A@@ gn@@ es three years ago in the Ri@@ ft V@@ al@@ ley .
"When she was a young girl , she had been mu@@ ti@@ lated against her will ."
That mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation of her c@@ lit@@ or@@ is had actually obvi@@ ously impac@@ ted her life and changed it in a way that was de@@ v@@ ast@@ ating .
"S@@ he made a deci@@ sion not to go and get a raz@@ or or a gl@@ as@@ s sh@@ ard , but to de@@ v@@ ot@@ e her life to stop@@ ping that happening to other girls ."
"For eight years , she wal@@ ked through the Ri@@ ft V@@ al@@ ley ."
"S@@ he had this amazing box that she car@@ ried and it had a tor@@ so of a woman &apos;s body in it , a half a tor@@ so , and she would te@@ ach people , every@@ where she went , what a health@@ y v@@ ag@@ ina looked like and what a mu@@ ti@@ lated v@@ ag@@ ina looked like ."
"In the years that she wal@@ ked , she edu@@ c@@ ated parents , mo@@ thers , fa@@ thers ."
"S@@ he sa@@ ved 1@@ ,@@ 500 girls from being cut ."
"When V@@ -@@ D@@ ay met her , we asked her how we could sup@@ port her and she said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you got me a Je@@ ep , I could get around a lot f@@ ast@@ er . &quot; &quot; So , we b@@ ou@@ ght her a Je@@ ep ."
"In the year she had the Je@@ ep , she sa@@ ved 4@@ ,@@ 500 girls from being cut ."
"So , we said , what else could we do ?"
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; If you help me get money , I could open a house . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ree years ago , A@@ gn@@ es open@@ ed a sa@@ fe house in Africa to stop mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation ."

"I am pro@@ u@@ d to tell you that six months ago , she was ele@@ cted the de@@ pu@@ ty ma@@ y@@ or of Na@@ rok ."
"( Applause ) I think what I &apos;m trying to say here is that if your end go@@ al is secu@@ ri@@ ty , and if that &apos;s all you &apos;re fo@@ c@@ using on , what en@@ ds up happening is that you create not only more in@@ secu@@ ri@@ ty in other people , but you make yourself far more in@@ secu@@ re ."
"R@@ e@@ al secu@@ ri@@ ty is con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating death , not pre@@ ten@@ ding it doesn &apos;t exi@@ st ."

"R@@ e@@ al secu@@ ri@@ ty is not know@@ ing something , when you don &apos;t know it ."
Re@@ al secu@@ ri@@ ty is hun@@ g@@ ering for conne@@ ction rather than power .

All of us are re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .

And I think part of what I &apos;m lear@@ ning in this process is that one must al@@ low on@@ es@@ el@@ f to feel gr@@ ie@@ f .
"And I think as long as I keep gr@@ ie@@ ving , and wee@@ ping , and then moving on , I &apos;m f@@ ine ."
"When I start to pre@@ ten@@ d that what I &apos;m seeing isn &apos;t impac@@ ting me , and isn &apos;t chang@@ ing my heart , then I get in t@@ rou@@ ble ."

"CA : There are a lot of ca@@ uses out there in the world that have been tal@@ ked about , you know , po@@ ver@@ ty , si@@ ck@@ ness and so on . You spent eight years on this one ."
Why this one ?
"E@@ E : I think that if you think about women , women are the pri@@ mar@@ y re@@ source of the planet .

The re@@ use of sy@@ r@@ ing@@ es now ex@@ ce@@ eds that and kil@@ ls 1@@ .@@ 3 million people a year .
This young girl and her friend that I met in an or@@ ph@@ an@@ age in D@@ el@@ h@@ i were HIV posi@@ tive from a sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge .
"And what was so sa@@ d about this particular story was that once their parents had found out — and don &apos;t for@@ get , their parents took them to the do@@ ctor — the parents thre@@ w them out on the stre@@ et ."
And h@@ ence they en@@ ded up in an or@@ ph@@ an@@ age .
"And it comes from situ@@ ations like this where you have either sk@@ il@@ led or un@@ sk@@ il@@ led prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers , b@@ lin@@ d@@ ly gi@@ ving an in@@ je@@ ction to someone ."
"And the in@@ je@@ ction is so val@@ u@@ able , that the people basically tr@@ ust the do@@ ctor , being second to God , which I &apos;ve heard many times , to do the right thing . But in fact they &apos;re not ."
"And you can understand , obvi@@ ously , the trans@@ mis@@ sion problem between people in high-@@ vi@@ ru@@ s are@@ as ."
"This video we took under@@ co@@ ver , which shows you , over a half an hour per@@ i@@ od , a tra@@ y of medi@@ cin@@ es of 4@@ 2 vi@@ als , which are being deli@@ vered with only 2 sy@@ r@@ ing@@ es in a public ho@@ spit@@ al in Indi@@ a ."
"And over the course of half an hour , not one sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge was fil@@ med being un@@ w@@ ra@@ pped ."
They started with two and they en@@ ded with two .
"And you &apos;ll see , just now , a n@@ ur@@ se coming back to the tra@@ y , which is their sort of mo@@ du@@ lar st@@ ation , and dro@@ pping the sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge she &apos;s just used back in the tra@@ y for it to be pi@@ cked up and used again ."
So you can imagine the scale of this problem .
"And in fact in Indi@@ a alone , 6@@ 2 percent of all in@@ je@@ ctions given are un@@ sa@@ fe ."
These kids in P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an don &apos;t go to school .
They are lu@@ ck@@ y . They already have a job .
"And that job is that they go around and pi@@ ck up sy@@ r@@ ing@@ es from the back of ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s , wa@@ sh them , and in the course of this , obvi@@ ously pi@@ c@@ king them up they in@@ ju@@ re themselves ."
"And then they re@@ pac@@ k@@ age them and se@@ ll them out on marke@@ ts for liter@@ ally more money than a st@@ eri@@ le sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge in the first place , which is quite bi@@ zar@@ re ."
"In an interesting ph@@ oto , their father , while we were talking to him , pi@@ cked up a sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge and pri@@ cked his fin@@ ger — I don &apos;t know whether you can see the dro@@ p of blo@@ od on the end — and im@@ medi@@ ately whi@@ pped out a box of mat@@ ch@@ es , li@@ t one , and bur@@ ned the blo@@ od off the end of his fin@@ ger , gi@@ ving me full as@@ su@@ ran@@ ce that that was the way that you stop@@ ped the trans@@ mis@@ sion of HIV ."
"In China , re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling is a major issue ."
"And they are colle@@ cted en mas@@ s — you can see the scale of it here — and sor@@ ted out , by hand , back into the right si@@ z@@ es , and then put back out on the stre@@ et ."
So re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling and re@@ use are the major issu@@ es here .
But there was one interesting an@@ e@@ c@@ dot@@ e that I found in In@@ d@@ one@@ si@@ a .
"In all scho@@ ols in In@@ d@@ one@@ si@@ a , there is usu@@ ally a to@@ y sel@@ ler in the pla@@ y@@ ground ."
"The to@@ y sel@@ ler , in this case , had sy@@ r@@ ing@@ es , which they usu@@ ally do , next door to the di@@ gg@@ ers , which is obvi@@ ously what you would expe@@ ct ."
"And they use them , in the bre@@ ak@@ s , for water pi@@ st@@ ols ."
"They squ@@ ir@@ t them at each other , which is lo@@ vely and in@@ no@@ cent ."
And they are having great fun .
"But they also d@@ r@@ in@@ k from them while they &apos;re in their bre@@ ak@@ s , because it &apos;s ho@@ t ."
And they squ@@ ir@@ t the water into their m@@ ou@@ ths .
And these are used with trac@@ es of blo@@ od visi@@ ble .
So we need a better produ@@ ct . And we need better information .
"And I think , if I can just bor@@ row this cam@@ era , I was going to show you my inv@@ en@@ tion , which I came up with ."
"So , it &apos;s a nor@@ mal@@ -@@ looking sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge ."
You lo@@ ad it up in the nor@@ mal way . This is made on ex@@ ist@@ ing e@@ qui@@ pment in 14 fac@@ tor@@ ies that we li@@ cen@@ se .
You give the in@@ je@@ ction and then put it down .
"If someone then tries to re@@ use it , it lo@@ cks and bre@@ ak@@ s af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds ."
"It &apos;s very , very simple . Thank you ."
( Applause ) And it co@@ sts the same as a nor@@ mal sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge .
"And in com@@ par@@ is@@ on , a Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a is 10 times the pri@@ ce ."
And that will stop re@@ using a sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge 20 or 30 times .
And I have an information ch@@ ari@@ ty which has done huge scale amount of work in Indi@@ a .
"And we &apos;re very pro@@ u@@ d of gi@@ ving information to people , so that little kids like this don &apos;t do stu@@ pi@@ d things ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
S@@ al@@ a@@ am . N@@ am@@ as@@ ka@@ r .
Go@@ od morning .
"G@@ i@@ ven my TED pro@@ fi@@ le , you might be expe@@ cting that I &apos;m going to speak to you about the lat@@ est ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pi@@ c tr@@ en@@ ds — the one that &apos;s cur@@ r@@ ently got W@@ all St@@ re@@ et and the World B@@ ank bu@@ z@@ z@@ ing — how to inv@@ est in women , how to em@@ power them , how to sa@@ ve them ."
N@@ ot me .
I am interested in how women are sa@@ ving us .
"They &apos;re sa@@ ving us by re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing and re@@ -@@ imag@@ ining a future that def@@ ies and blu@@ r@@ s ac@@ cep@@ ted po@@ lar@@ it@@ ies , po@@ lar@@ it@@ ies we &apos;ve taken for gran@@ ted for a long time , like the ones between moder@@ ni@@ ty and tra@@ di@@ tion , F@@ ir@@ st World and Th@@ ird World , op@@ pres@@ sion and opportunity ."
"In the mi@@ d@@ st of the da@@ un@@ ting challen@@ ges we face as a global community , there &apos;s something about this third way ra@@ ga that is making my heart sing ."
"What in@@ tri@@ gu@@ es me most is how women are doing this , des@@ pi@@ te a set of par@@ ad@@ o@@ x@@ es that are both f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating and fas@@ cin@@ ating ."
"Wh@@ y is it that women are , on the one hand , vi@@ ci@@ ously op@@ pres@@ sed by cul@@ tu@@ ral prac@@ ti@@ ces , and yet at the same time , are the pre@@ ser@@ ver@@ s of cul@@ tu@@ res in most socie@@ ties ?"
Is the hi@@ ja@@ b or the he@@ ad@@ sc@@ ar@@ f a sym@@ bo@@ l of sub@@ mis@@ sion or resi@@ stance ?
"When so many women and girls are be@@ at@@ en , ra@@ ped , ma@@ im@@ ed on a da@@ i@@ ly basi@@ s in the name of all kinds of ca@@ uses — hon@@ or , religi@@ on , n@@ ati@@ on@@ ality — what allow@@ s women to re@@ pl@@ ant tre@@ es , to re@@ build socie@@ ties , to le@@ ad radi@@ cal , n@@ on-@@ viol@@ ent mov@@ em@@ ents for social change ?"
Is it different women who are doing the pre@@ ser@@ ving and the radi@@ c@@ aliz@@ ing ?
O@@ r are they one and the same ?
"A@@ re we gu@@ il@@ ty , as Chi@@ m@@ am@@ an@@ da A@@ di@@ ch@@ ie re@@ min@@ ded us at the TED con@@ fer@@ ence in O@@ x@@ for@@ d , of as@@ sum@@ ing that there is a single story of women &apos;s stru@@ gg@@ les for their ri@@ ghts while there are , in fact , many ?"
"And what , if anything , do men have to do with it ?"
Mu@@ ch of my life has been a qu@@ est to get some ans@@ w@@ ers to these questions .
It &apos;s taken me across the g@@ lo@@ be and in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced me to some amazing people .
"In the process , I &apos;ve ga@@ ther@@ ed a few fra@@ g@@ ments that help me shed some light on this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le ."
"A@@ mon@@ g those who &apos;ve hel@@ ped open my eyes to a third way are : a de@@ v@@ out M@@ us@@ li@@ m in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , a group of har@@ mon@@ i@@ z@@ ing l@@ es@@ bi@@ ans in C@@ ro@@ ati@@ a and a tab@@ o@@ o bre@@ ak@@ er in Li@@ b@@ eri@@ a ."
"I &apos;m in@@ de@@ b@@ ted to them , as I am to my parents , who for some set of mis@@ de@@ me@@ an@@ ors in their last life , were bl@@ ess@@ ed with three d@@ augh@@ ters in this one ."
"And for reas@@ ons equ@@ ally un@@ clear to me , se@@ em to be in@@ ordin@@ ately pro@@ u@@ d of the three of us ."
"I was born and ra@@ is@@ ed here in Indi@@ a , and I learned from an early age to be de@@ e@@ ply s@@ us@@ pi@@ ci@@ ous of the a@@ un@@ ties and un@@ cles who would b@@ end down , p@@ at us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all , &quot; &quot; Po@@ or things . You only have three d@@ augh@@ ters ."
"But you &apos;re young , you could still try again . &quot; &quot; My sense of ou@@ tra@@ ge about women &apos;s ri@@ ghts was brought to a bo@@ il when I was about 11 ."
"My a@@ un@@ t , an incredi@@ bly arti@@ cul@@ ate and bri@@ lli@@ ant woman , was wi@@ dow@@ ed early ."
A flo@@ ck of relati@@ ves des@@ cen@@ ded on her .
They took off her col@@ or@@ ful s@@ ar@@ i .
They made her we@@ ar a white one .
They wi@@ ped her bin@@ d@@ i off her fore@@ head .
They bro@@ ke her b@@ ang@@ les .
"H@@ er d@@ aughter , R@@ ani , a few years ol@@ der than me , s@@ at in her la@@ p be@@ wil@@ der@@ ed , not know@@ ing what had happened to the con@@ fi@@ dent woman she once knew as her mother ."
"L@@ ate that night , I heard my mother be@@ gg@@ ing my father , &quot; P@@ le@@ ase do something R@@ am@@ u . C@@ an &apos;t you inter@@ ven@@ e ? &quot;"
"And my father , in a low vo@@ ice , mu@@ t@@ ter@@ ing , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just the youn@@ gest bro@@ ther , there &apos;s nothing I can do ."
This is tra@@ di@@ tion . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the night I learned the ru@@ les about what it means to be fe@@ m@@ ale in this world .
"W@@ om@@ en don &apos;t make those ru@@ les , but they def@@ ine us , and they def@@ ine our opportuni@@ ties and our ch@@ an@@ ces ."
And men are af@@ fe@@ cted by those ru@@ les too .
"My father , who had f@@ ou@@ ght in three war@@ s , could not sa@@ ve his own si@@ ster from this su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing ."
"B@@ y 18 , under the ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent tu@@ tel@@ age of my mother , I was ther@@ e@@ fore , as you might expe@@ ct , de@@ fi@@ an@@ tly fe@@ min@@ i@@ st ."
"O@@ n the stre@@ ets ch@@ an@@ ting , &quot; &quot; &#91; H@@ in@@ d@@ i &#93; &#91; H@@ in@@ d@@ i &#93; We are the women of Indi@@ a ."
"We are not f@@ low@@ ers , we are sp@@ ar@@ ks of change . &quot; &quot; B@@ y the time I got to Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing in 199@@ 5 , it was clear to me , the only way to ach@@ ie@@ ve gen@@ der equ@@ ality was to over@@ turn cen@@ tur@@ ies of op@@ pres@@ sive tra@@ di@@ tion ."
"S@@ o@@ on after I re@@ turned from Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing , I le@@ ap@@ t at the ch@@ ance to work for this wonderful organiz@@ ation , f@@ oun@@ ded by women , to sup@@ port women &apos;s ri@@ ghts organiz@@ ations around the g@@ lo@@ be ."
"But bar@@ ely six months into my new job , I met a woman who for@@ ced me to challen@@ ge all my as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ."
H@@ er name is S@@ ak@@ en@@ a Y@@ ac@@ o@@ ob@@ i .
She wal@@ ked into my offi@@ ce at a time when no one knew where Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan was in the United States .
"S@@ he said to me , &quot; &quot; It is not about the bur@@ ka . &quot; &quot; She was the most de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed adv@@ oc@@ ate for women &apos;s ri@@ ghts I had ever heard ."
"S@@ he told me women were ru@@ n@@ ning under@@ ground scho@@ ols in her communi@@ ties inside Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , and that her organiz@@ ation , the Af@@ gh@@ an In@@ stitu@@ te of L@@ ear@@ ning , had started a school in P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an ."
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; The first thing any@@ one who is a M@@ us@@ li@@ m know@@ s is that the K@@ or@@ an requi@@ res and stron@@ g@@ ly sup@@ por@@ ts liter@@ acy ."
The pro@@ ph@@ et wanted every belie@@ ver to be able to read the K@@ or@@ an for themselves . &quot; &quot; H@@ ad I heard right ?
W@@ as a women &apos;s ri@@ ghts adv@@ oc@@ ate inv@@ o@@ king religi@@ on ?
But S@@ ak@@ en@@ a def@@ ies la@@ be@@ ls .
"S@@ he always we@@ ars a he@@ ad@@ sc@@ ar@@ f , but I &apos;ve wal@@ ked al@@ on@@ g@@ side with her on a be@@ ach with her long ha@@ ir fl@@ ying in the bre@@ e@@ ze ."
"S@@ he star@@ ts every le@@ cture with a pra@@ y@@ er , but she &apos;s a single , fe@@ ist@@ y , fin@@ an@@ cially in@@ depen@@ dent woman in a country where girls are mar@@ ried off at the age of 12 ."
She is also im@@ men@@ se@@ ly pra@@ g@@ m@@ atic .
"&quot; &quot; This he@@ ad@@ sc@@ ar@@ f and these clo@@ the@@ s , &quot; &quot; she says , &quot; &quot; give me the fre@@ e@@ dom to do what I need to do to speak to those wh@@ ose sup@@ port and as@@ si@@ stance are cri@@ tical for this work ."
"When I had to open the school in the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p , I went to see the im@@ am ."
"I told him , &apos; I &apos;m a belie@@ ver , and women and children in these terri@@ ble con@@ di@@ tions need their fai@@ th to survi@@ ve . &apos; &quot; &quot; She s@@ miles s@@ ly@@ ly ."
&quot; &quot; He was f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ed .
He began to come t@@ wi@@ ce a week to my cen@@ ter because women could not go to the mo@@ squ@@ e .
"And after he would leave , women and girls would st@@ ay behind ."
"We began with a small liter@@ acy clas@@ s to read the K@@ or@@ an , then a mat@@ h clas@@ s , then an En@@ g@@ li@@ sh clas@@ s , then computer clas@@ ses ."
"In a few weeks , everyone in the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p was in our clas@@ ses . &quot; &quot; S@@ ak@@ en@@ a is a teach@@ er at a time when to edu@@ cate women is a d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous business in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan ."
She is on the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an &apos;s h@@ it li@@ st .
I wor@@ ry about her every time she tra@@ v@@ els across that country .
She sh@@ ru@@ gs when I ask her about sa@@ fe@@ ty .
"&quot; &quot; K@@ avi@@ ta ja@@ an , we cannot al@@ low ourselves to be af@@ ra@@ id ."
"L@@ ook at those young girls who go back to school when ac@@ id is th@@ row@@ n in their face . &quot; &quot; And I smi@@ le , and I no@@ d , realiz@@ ing I &apos;m wat@@ ching women and girls using their own religi@@ ous tra@@ di@@ tions and prac@@ ti@@ ces , tur@@ ning them into instru@@ ments of op@@ posi@@ tion and opportunity ."
Th@@ e@@ ir pat@@ h is their own and it looks towar@@ ds an Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan that will be different .
"Be@@ ing different is something the women of L@@ es@@ b@@ or in Z@@ ag@@ re@@ b , C@@ ro@@ ati@@ a know all too well ."
"To be a l@@ es@@ bi@@ an , a dy@@ ke , a hom@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al in most par@@ ts of the world , inclu@@ ding right here in our country , Indi@@ a , is to oc@@ cu@@ py a place of im@@ men@@ se dis@@ comfor@@ t and extre@@ me pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce ."

"So enter a group of out dy@@ k@@ es , young women who love the old music that once sp@@ read across that regi@@ on from M@@ ac@@ ed@@ on@@ ia to B@@ os@@ nia , from S@@ er@@ bi@@ a to S@@ lo@@ v@@ enia ."
These fol@@ k sing@@ ers met at colle@@ ge at a gen@@ der stud@@ ies program .

"As Le@@ ah , one of the f@@ oun@@ ders of the group , says , &quot; &quot; I like tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal music very much ."
I also like ro@@ ck and ro@@ ll .
"So L@@ es@@ b@@ or , we bl@@ end the two ."
"I see tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal music like a kind of re@@ be@@ llion , in which people can really speak their vo@@ ice , es@@ pe@@ cially tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal son@@ gs from other par@@ ts of the form@@ er Y@@ u@@ go@@ s@@ la@@ v Re@@ public ."

"One night , she had a dre@@ am ."

We were not going to leave until the pe@@ ace ac@@ cor@@ d was sig@@ ned . &quot; &quot; And the pe@@ ace ac@@ cor@@ d was sig@@ ned .

"So to par@@ a@@ ph@@ ra@@ se Mar@@ x : W@@ om@@ en make change , but not in cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces of their own cho@@ os@@ ing ."

I think the beautiful M@@ al@@ in &#91; A@@ k@@ er@@ man &#93; put it perfe@@ ct@@ ly .
E@@ very man des@@ er@@ ves the opportunity to gro@@ w a little bit of lu@@ x@@ ury .
"L@@ ad@@ ies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , and more import@@ an@@ tly , M@@ o B@@ ro@@ s and M@@ o S@@ ist@@ as — ( Laughter ) — for the next 1@@ 7 minutes , I &apos;m going to share with you my Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber jour@@ ney , and how , through that jour@@ ney , we &apos;ve re@@ de@@ fin@@ ed ch@@ ari@@ ty , we &apos;re re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing the way prost@@ ate can@@ cer resear@@ ch@@ ers are working together throu@@ gh@@ out the world , and I hope , through that process , that I inspi@@ re you to create something sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant in your life , something sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant that will go on and make this world a better place ."
"So the most common question I get asked , and I &apos;m going to answer it now so I don &apos;t have to do it over d@@ r@@ in@@ ks ton@@ ight , is how did this come about ?"
How did Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber start ?
"Well , nor@@ m@@ ally , a ch@@ ari@@ ty star@@ ts with the cause , and someone that is dire@@ ct@@ ly af@@ fe@@ cted by a cause ."
"They then go on to create an ev@@ ent , and be@@ y@@ ond that , a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation to sup@@ port that ."
"P@@ re@@ t@@ ty much in every case , that &apos;s how a ch@@ ari@@ ty star@@ ts ."
N@@ ot so with Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber . Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber started in a very tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal Au@@ str@@ ali@@ an way . It was on a S@@ un@@ day af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
"I was with my bro@@ ther and a m@@ ate having a few be@@ ers , and I was wat@@ ching the world go by , had a few more be@@ ers , and the convers@@ ation turned to &apos; 7@@ 0s fas@@ hi@@ on — ( Laughter ) — and how everything man@@ ages to come back into sty@@ le ."
"And a few more be@@ ers , I said , &quot; &quot; There has to be some stuff that ha@@ sn &apos;t come back . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Th@@ en one more be@@ er and it was , whatever happened to the mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he ?"
"Wh@@ y ha@@ sn &apos;t that made a com@@ e@@ back ? ( Laughter ) So then there was a lot more be@@ ers , and then the day en@@ ded with a challen@@ ge to bring the mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he back . ( Laughter ) So in Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , &quot; &quot; mo &quot; &quot; is s@@ lan@@ g for mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he , so we ren@@ am@@ ed the mon@@ th of N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber &quot; &quot; Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber &quot; &quot; and created some pretty basi@@ c ru@@ les , which still stand today ."
"And they are : start the mon@@ th cle@@ an@@ -@@ sha@@ ven , ro@@ ck a mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he — not a be@@ ard , not a go@@ ate@@ e , a mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he — for the 30 days of N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber , and then we ag@@ re@@ ed that we would come together at the end of the mon@@ th , have a mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he@@ -@@ them@@ ed par@@ ty , and aw@@ ard a pri@@ ze for the best , and of course , the wor@@ st mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he . ( Laughter ) Now tr@@ ust me , when you &apos;re grow@@ ing a mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he back in 200@@ 3 , and there were 30 of us back then , and this was before the i@@ ro@@ nic hi@@ p@@ ster mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he movement — ( Laughter ) — it created a lot of contro@@ vers@@ y . ( Laughter ) So my b@@ os@@ s wouldn &apos;t let me go and see cl@@ ien@@ ts ."
"My gir@@ l@@ friend at the time , who &apos;s no longer my gir@@ l@@ friend — ( Laughter ) — h@@ ated it ."
"P@@ ar@@ ents would sh@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ le kids away from us . ( Laughter ) But we came together at the end of the mon@@ th and we ce@@ le@@ br@@ ated our jour@@ ney , and it was a real jour@@ ney ."
"And we had a lot of fun , and in 200@@ 4 , I said to the guys , &quot; &quot; That was so much fun . We need to le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mi@@ ze this so we can get away with it year on year . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So we started thinking about that , and we were inspi@@ red by the women around us and all they were doing for bre@@ ast can@@ cer ."
"And we thought , you know what , there &apos;s nothing for men &apos;s health ."
Why is that ? Why can &apos;t we com@@ b@@ ine grow@@ ing a mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he and doing something for men &apos;s health ?
"And I started to research that top@@ ic , and disco@@ vered prost@@ ate can@@ cer is the m@@ ale e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of bre@@ ast can@@ cer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are di@@ ag@@ no@@ sed with it ."
"But there was nothing for this cause , so we mar@@ ried grow@@ ing a mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he with prost@@ ate can@@ cer , and then we created our t@@ ag@@ line , which is , &quot; Ch@@ ang@@ ing the face of men &apos;s health . &quot;"
"And that e@@ lo@@ qu@@ ently descri@@ be@@ s the challen@@ ge , chang@@ ing your ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance for the 30 days , and also the out@@ come that we &apos;re trying to ach@@ ie@@ ve : getting men eng@@ aged in their health , having them have a better under@@ standing about the health ri@@ sk@@ s that they face ."
"So with that model , I then col@@ d-@@ called the C@@ E@@ O of the Pro@@ state C@@ an@@ cer F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
"I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the most amazing idea that &apos;s going to trans@@ form your organiz@@ ation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I didn &apos;t want to share with him the idea over the phone , so I con@@ v@@ in@@ ced him to me@@ et with me for co@@ f@@ fe@@ e in M@@ el@@ b@@ our@@ ne in 200@@ 4 ."
"And we s@@ at down , and I sh@@ ared with him my vision of getting men grow@@ ing mu@@ st@@ ach@@ es across Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , ra@@ is@@ ing aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess for this cause , and fun@@ ds for his organiz@@ ation . And I needed a part@@ ner@@ ship to le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely do that ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to come together at the end , we &apos;re going to have a mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he@@ -@@ them@@ ed par@@ ty , we &apos;re going to have D@@ J@@ s , we &apos;re going to ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate life , and we &apos;re going to change the face of men &apos;s health . &quot; &quot; And he just looked at me and l@@ augh@@ ed , and he said , he said , &quot; &quot; A@@ d@@ am , that &apos;s a really no@@ vel idea , but we &apos;re an ul@@ trac@@ on@@ ser@@ v@@ ative organiz@@ ation ."
"We can &apos;t have anything to do with you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I pa@@ id for co@@ f@@ fe@@ e that day — ( Laughter ) — and his par@@ ting com@@ ment as we sho@@ ok h@@ ands was , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , if you happen to ra@@ ise any money out of this , we &apos;ll gl@@ ad@@ ly take it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So my l@@ es@@ son that year was per@@ si@@ st@@ ence ."
"And we per@@ si@@ st@@ ed , and we got 4@@ 50 guys grow@@ ing mu@@ st@@ ach@@ es , and together we ra@@ is@@ ed 5@@ 4@@ ,000 dollars , and we d@@ on@@ ated every cent of that to the Pro@@ state C@@ an@@ cer F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , and that re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted at the time the single bi@@ ggest d@@ on@@ ation they &apos;d ever re@@ cei@@ ved ."
"So from that day forward , my life has become about a mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he ."
"E@@ very day — this morning , I wa@@ ke up and go , my life is about a mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he . ( Laughter ) E@@ s@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally , I &apos;m a mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he farm@@ er . ( Laughter ) And my se@@ as@@ on is N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So in 200@@ 5 , the cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n got more mom@@ entu@@ m , was more suc@@ cess@@ ful in Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a and then New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , and then in 200@@ 6 we came to a pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al point ."
"It was con@@ sum@@ ing so much of our time after hours on we@@ ek@@ en@@ ds that we thought , we either need to close this down or figure a way to fu@@ nd Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber so that I could qu@@ it my job and go and spend more time in the organiz@@ ation and take it to the next level ."
"It &apos;s really interesting when you try and figure a way to fu@@ nd a fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing organiz@@ ation built off grow@@ ing mu@@ st@@ ach@@ es . ( Laughter ) Let me tell you that there &apos;s not too many people interested in inv@@ est@@ ing in that , not even the Pro@@ state C@@ an@@ cer F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation , who we &apos;d ra@@ is@@ ed about 1@@ .@@ 2 million dollars for at that st@@ age ."
"So again we per@@ si@@ st@@ ed , and F@@ ost@@ er &apos;s B@@ re@@ w@@ ing came to the par@@ ty and gave us our first ever spon@@ sor@@ ship , and that was enough for me to qu@@ it my job , I did con@@ sul@@ ting on the side ."
"And le@@ ading into Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber 200@@ 6 , we &apos;d run through all the money from F@@ ost@@ er &apos;s , we &apos;d run through all the money I had , and essen@@ ti@@ ally we had no money left , and we &apos;d con@@ v@@ in@@ ced all our sup@@ pl@@ ier@@ s — cre@@ ative ag@@ en@@ cies , we@@ b develo@@ pment ag@@ en@@ cies , h@@ ost@@ ing comp@@ an@@ ies , wh@@ at@@ not — to de@@ l@@ ay their bi@@ l@@ ling until De@@ c@@ em@@ ber ."
"So we &apos;d rac@@ ked up at this st@@ age about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars wor@@ th of de@@ b@@ t . So if Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber 200@@ 6 didn &apos;t happen , the four f@@ oun@@ ders , well , we would &apos;ve been bro@@ ke , we would &apos;ve been hom@@ el@@ ess , sitting on the stre@@ et with mu@@ st@@ ach@@ es . ( Laughter ) But we thought , you know what , if that &apos;s the wor@@ st thing that happens , so what ?"
"We &apos;re going to have a lot of fun doing it , and it t@@ au@@ ght us the import@@ ance of taking ri@@ sk@@ s and really s@@ mar@@ t ri@@ sk@@ s ."
"Th@@ en in early 200@@ 7 , a really interesting thing happened ."
"We had M@@ o B@@ ro@@ s from C@@ an@@ ada , from the U.@@ S. , and from the U.@@ K@@ . e@@ ma@@ il@@ ing us and cal@@ ling us and saying , h@@ ey , there &apos;s nothing for prost@@ ate can@@ cer ."
B@@ ring this cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to these countries .
"So we thought , why not ? Let &apos;s do it ."
"So I col@@ d-@@ called the C@@ E@@ O of Pro@@ state C@@ an@@ cer C@@ an@@ ada , and I said to him , &quot; &quot; I have this most amazing con@@ cept . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; It &apos;s going to trans@@ form your organiz@@ ation . I don &apos;t want to tell you about it now , but will you me@@ et with me if I f@@ ly all the way to T@@ o@@ ron@@ to ? &quot; &quot; So I f@@ le@@ w here , met down on F@@ ron@@ t St@@ re@@ et E@@ ast , and we s@@ at in the bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om , and I said , &quot; &quot; R@@ ight , here &apos;s my vision of getting men grow@@ ing mu@@ st@@ ach@@ es all across C@@ an@@ ada ra@@ is@@ ing aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess and fun@@ ds for your organiz@@ ation . &quot; &quot; And he looked at me and l@@ augh@@ ed and said , &quot; &quot; A@@ d@@ am , sounds like a really no@@ vel idea , but we &apos;@@ re@@ "
an ul@@ trac@@ on@@ ser@@ v@@ ative organiz@@ ation . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve heard this before . I know how it goes .
"But he said , &quot; &quot; We will part@@ ner with you , but we &apos;re not going to inv@@ est in it . You need to figure a way to bring this cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n across here and make it work . &quot; &quot; So what we did was , we took some of the money that we ra@@ is@@ ed in Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a to bring the cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n across to this country , the U.@@ S , and the U.@@ K@@ . , and we did that because we knew , if this was suc@@ cess@@ ful , we could ra@@ ise in@@ fini@@ tely more money glob@@ ally than we could just in Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a . And that money fu@@ els research , and that research will get us to a cu@@ re ."
"And we &apos;re not about fin@@ ding an Au@@ str@@ ali@@ an cu@@ re or a C@@ an@@ ad@@ i@@ an cu@@ re , we &apos;re about fin@@ ding the cu@@ re ."
"So in 200@@ 7 , we brought the cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n across here , and it was , it set the st@@ age for the cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n ."
It wasn &apos;t as suc@@ cess@@ ful as we thought it would be .
We were sort of very g@@ ung h@@ o with our suc@@ cess in Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a and New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and at that st@@ age .
So that year really t@@ au@@ ght us the import@@ ance of being patien@@ t and really under@@ standing the local market before you become so b@@ old as to set lo@@ f@@ ty tar@@ gets .
"But what I &apos;m really ple@@ as@@ ed to say is , in 20@@ 10 , Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber became a tru@@ ly global movement ."
C@@ an@@ ada was just pi@@ pped to the pos@@ t in terms of the number one fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n in the world .
"L@@ ast year we had 4@@ 5@@ 0,000 M@@ o B@@ ro@@ s sp@@ read across the world and together we ra@@ is@@ ed 7@@ 7 million dollars ."
( Applause ) And that makes Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber now the bi@@ ggest fun@@ der of prost@@ ate can@@ cer research and sup@@ port progra@@ ms in the world .
"And that is an amazing ach@@ ie@@ v@@ ement when you think about us grow@@ ing mu@@ st@@ ach@@ es . ( Laughter ) And for us , we have re@@ de@@ fin@@ ed ch@@ ari@@ ty ."
"O@@ ur ri@@ b@@ b@@ on is a ha@@ i@@ ry ri@@ b@@ b@@ on . ( Laughter ) O@@ ur am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ ors are the M@@ o B@@ ro@@ s and the M@@ o S@@ ist@@ as , and I think that &apos;s been fundam@@ ent@@ al to our suc@@ cess ."
We hand across our br@@ and and our cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to those people .
We let them em@@ brac@@ e it and inter@@ pre@@ t it in their own way .
"So now I live in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , because the Pro@@ state C@@ an@@ cer F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of the U.@@ S. is based there , and I always get asked by the media down there , because it &apos;s so ce@@ le@@ bri@@ ty@@ -@@ dri@@ ven , &quot; Wh@@ o are your ce@@ le@@ bri@@ ty am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ ors ? &quot;"
"And I say to them , &quot; &quot; L@@ ast year we were for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate enough to have 4@@ 5@@ 0,000 ce@@ le@@ bri@@ ty am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ ors . &quot; &quot; And they go , &quot; &quot; What , what do you mean ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s like , everything single person , every single M@@ o B@@ r@@ o and M@@ o S@@ ist@@ a that parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ es in Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber is our ce@@ le@@ bri@@ ty am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ or , and that is so , so important and fundam@@ ent@@ al to our suc@@ cess ."
"Now what I want to share with you is one of my most tou@@ ching Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber mom@@ ents , and it happened here in T@@ o@@ ron@@ to last year , at the end of the cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n ."
I was out with a team . It was the end of Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber .
"We &apos;d had a great cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , and to be hon@@ est , we &apos;d had our fa@@ ir share of be@@ er that night , but I said , &quot; &quot; You know what , I think we &apos;ve got one more b@@ ar left in us . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So we pi@@ led into a ta@@ x@@ i , and this is our ta@@ x@@ i dri@@ ver , and I was sitting in the back se@@ at , and he turned around and said , &quot; &quot; W@@ here are you going ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; H@@ an@@ g on , that is an amazing mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m doing it for Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; So am I@@ . &quot; And I said , &quot; T@@ ell me your Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber story . &quot;"
"And he goes , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , I know it &apos;s about men &apos;s health , I know it &apos;s about prost@@ ate can@@ cer , but this is for bre@@ ast can@@ cer . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , that &apos;s interesting . &quot; &quot; And he goes , &quot; &quot; L@@ ast year , my mo@@ m pas@@ sed away from bre@@ ast can@@ cer in S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ ka , because we couldn &apos;t af@@ for@@ d pro@@ per tre@@ at@@ ment for her , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; This mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he is my tri@@ bu@@ te to my mo@@ m . &quot; &quot; And we sort of all cho@@ ked up in the back of the ta@@ x@@ i , and I didn &apos;t tell him who I was , because I didn &apos;t think it was appro@@ pri@@ ate , and I just sho@@ ok his hand and I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you so much ."
"@@ Y@@ our mo@@ m would be so pro@@ u@@ d . &quot; &quot; And from that moment I realized that Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber is so much more than a mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he , having a jo@@ ke ."
"It &apos;s about each person coming to this pl@@ at@@ form , em@@ brac@@ ing it in their own way , and being sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant in their own life ."
"For us now at Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber , we really fo@@ cus on three program are@@ as , and having a true impac@@ t : aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess and education , survi@@ v@@ or sup@@ port progra@@ ms , and research ."
"Now we always fo@@ cus , natur@@ ally , on how much we ra@@ ise , because it &apos;s a very tan@@ gi@@ ble out@@ come , but for me , aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess and education is more important than the fun@@ ds we ra@@ ise , because I know that is chang@@ ing and sa@@ ving lives today , and it &apos;s probably best exam@@ p@@ led by a young guy that I met at S@@ outh by S@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est in Au@@ st@@ in , T@@ ex@@ as , at the start of the year ."
"He came up to me and said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for star@@ ting Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for doing Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber . &quot; &quot; And I looked at him , and I was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m pretty sure you can &apos;t gro@@ w a mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s your Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber story ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I gre@@ w the wor@@ st mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he ever . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; But I went home for Th@@ an@@ k@@ s@@ gi@@ ving din@@ ner , and pretty quickly the convers@@ ation around the table turned to what the he@@ ll was going on . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And we tal@@ ked — I tal@@ ked to them about Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber , and then after that , my d@@ ad came up to me , and at the ag@@ e@@ "
"@@ of 2@@ 6 , for the first time ever , I had a convers@@ ation with my d@@ ad one on one about men &apos;s health . I had a convers@@ ation with my d@@ ad about prost@@ ate can@@ cer , and I learned that my grand@@ father had prost@@ ate can@@ cer and I was able to share with my d@@ ad that he was t@@ wi@@ ce as li@@ ke@@ ly to get that dise@@ ase , and he didn &apos;t know that , and he ha@@ dn &apos;t been getting scre@@ en@@ ed for it . &quot; &quot; So now , that guy is getting scre@@ en@@ ed for prost@@ ate can@@ cer ."
"So those convers@@ ations , getting men eng@@ aged in this , at whatever age , is so cri@@ ti@@ cally important , and in my view so much more important than the fun@@ ds we ra@@ ise ."
"Now to the fun@@ ds we ra@@ ise , and research , and how we &apos;re re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing research ."
We fu@@ nd prost@@ ate can@@ cer f@@ oun@@ d@@ ations now in 1@@ 3 countries .
"We liter@@ ally fu@@ nd hundre@@ ds if not thousands of institu@@ tions and resear@@ ch@@ ers around the world , and when we looked at this more re@@ cent@@ ly , we realized there &apos;s a real l@@ ack of col@@ labor@@ ation going on even within institu@@ tions , let alone n@@ ati@@ on@@ ally , let alone glob@@ ally , and this is not uni@@ qu@@ e to prost@@ ate can@@ cer . This is can@@ cer research the world over ."
"And so we said , right , we &apos;d re@@ de@@ fin@@ ed ch@@ ari@@ ty . We need to re@@ def@@ ine the way these guys oper@@ ate . How do we do that ?"
"So what we did was , we created a global action pl@@ an , and we &apos;re taking 10 percent of what &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ed in each country now and pu@@ tting it into a global fu@@ nd , and we &apos;ve got the best prost@@ ate can@@ cer scienti@@ fic min@@ ds in the world that look after that fu@@ nd , and they come together each year and iden@@ ti@@ fy the number one pri@@ ori@@ ty , and that , last year , was getting a better scre@@ ening test ."
"So they iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ied that as a pri@@ ori@@ ty , and then they &apos;ve got and re@@ c@@ ru@@ i@@ ted now 3@@ 00 resear@@ ch@@ ers from around the world that are stu@@ dy@@ ing that top@@ ic , essen@@ ti@@ ally the same top@@ ic ."
"So now we &apos;re fun@@ ding them to the tu@@ ne of about five or six million dollars to col@@ labor@@ ate and br@@ ing@@ ing them together , and that &apos;s a uni@@ qu@@ e thing in the can@@ cer world , and we know , through that col@@ labor@@ ation , it will ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate out@@ comes ."
And that &apos;s how we &apos;re re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing the research world .
"So , what I know about my Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber jour@@ ney is that , with a really cre@@ ative idea , with pas@@ sion , with per@@ si@@ st@@ ence , and a lot of pat@@ ience , four mat@@ es , four mu@@ st@@ ach@@ es , can inspi@@ re a room full of people , and that room full of people can go on and inspi@@ re a city , and that city is M@@ el@@ b@@ our@@ ne , my home ."
"And that city can go on and inspi@@ re a state , and that state can go on and inspi@@ re a n@@ ation , and be@@ y@@ ond that , you can create a global movement that is chang@@ ing the face of men &apos;s health ."
"My name is A@@ d@@ am G@@ aro@@ ne , and that &apos;s my story ."
Thank you . ( Applause )

"C@@ ri@@ sis might se@@ em like a stron@@ g word , but there is data su@@ gg@@ est@@ ing it probably isn &apos;t ."
"There was , in fact , a pa@@ per of just this very name , &quot; &quot; Par@@ en@@ th@@ o@@ od as C@@ ri@@ sis , &quot; &quot; publi@@ shed in 19@@ 5@@ 7 , and in the 5@@ 0-@@ p@@ lu@@ s years since , there has been pl@@ en@@ ty of sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ing a pretty clear pat@@ ter@@ n of par@@ ent@@ al ang@@ u@@ is@@ h ."
Par@@ ents experience more stre@@ ss than n@@ on-@@ parents .
Th@@ e@@ ir mar@@ it@@ al s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion is low@@ er .
"There have been a number of stud@@ ies looking at how parents feel when they are sp@@ ending time with their kids , and the answer often is , not so great ."
Wh@@ o are on p@@ ar with str@@ ang@@ ers . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But here &apos;s the thing .
"I have been looking at what under@@ l@@ ies these data for three years , and children are not the problem ."
S@@ ome@@ thing about par@@ ent@@ ing right now at this moment is the problem .
"S@@ pe@@ ci@@ fi@@ cally , I don &apos;t think we know what par@@ ent@@ ing is sup@@ posed to be ."
"P@@ ar@@ ent , as a ver@@ b , only en@@ ter@@ ed common us@@ age in 19@@ 70 ."
O@@ ur ro@@ les as mo@@ thers and fa@@ thers have changed .
The ro@@ les of our children have changed .
"We are all now fu@@ ri@@ ously impro@@ vi@@ sing our way through a situ@@ ation for which there is no sc@@ ri@@ pt , and if you &apos;re an amazing j@@ az@@ z musi@@ ci@@ an , then impro@@ v is great , but for the rest of us , it can kind of feel like a cri@@ sis ."
So how did we get here ?
K@@ i@@ ds were consi@@ der@@ ed economic as@@ se@@ ts .
"We re@@ cogni@@ zed kids had ri@@ ghts , we ban@@ ned child lab@@ or , we fo@@ c@@ used on education instead , and school became a child &apos;s new work ."
And th@@ ank God it did .
"O@@ n@@ ce kids stop@@ ped working , the econ@@ omi@@ cs of par@@ ent@@ ing changed ."
"R@@ a@@ ther than them working for us , we began to work for them , because within only a matter of de@@ ca@@ des it became clear : if we wanted our kids to suc@@ ce@@ ed , school was not enough ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , ex@@ trac@@ ur@@ ri@@ cular acti@@ vi@@ ties are a kid &apos;s new work , but that &apos;s work for us too , because we are the ones dri@@ ving them to so@@ c@@ cer prac@@ ti@@ ce ."
"M@@ as@@ sive pi@@ les of h@@ ome@@ work are a kid &apos;s new work , but that &apos;s also work for us , because we have to che@@ ck it ."
"S@@ he said , almost c@@ as@@ u@@ ally , &quot; H@@ ome@@ work is the new din@@ ner . &quot;"
"Mo@@ thers now spend more time with their children than they did in 19@@ 6@@ 5 , when most women were not even in the wor@@ k@@ force ."
This was true even when I was young .
"And with all du@@ e re@@ spe@@ ct to the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese , it didn &apos;t turn out that way ."
"Now there is a certain kind of mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ clas@@ s par@@ ent that is ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with teach@@ ing their kids M@@ and@@ ar@@ in , and maybe they &apos;re on@@ to something , but we cannot know for sure ."
"We te@@ ach our kids ch@@ ess , thinking maybe they will need an@@ al@@ y@@ tical sk@@ il@@ ls ."
"We sig@@ n them up for team spor@@ ts , thinking maybe they will need col@@ labor@@ ative sk@@ il@@ ls , you know , for when they go to H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ iness S@@ cho@@ ol ."
"We try and te@@ ach them to be fin@@ an@@ cially sa@@ v@@ v@@ y and scien@@ ce@@ -@@ min@@ ded and e@@ co@@ -@@ frien@@ d@@ ly and g@@ lu@@ ten@@ -@@ f@@ ree , though now is probably a good time to tell you that I was not e@@ co@@ -@@ frien@@ d@@ ly and g@@ lu@@ ten@@ -@@ f@@ ree as a child ."
I ate j@@ ars of pu@@ re@@ ed m@@ ac@@ aro@@ ni and be@@ e@@ f .
And you know what ? I &apos;m doing o@@ kay .
I pay my ta@@ x@@ es .
I h@@ old down a ste@@ ady job .
I was even in@@ vi@@ ted to speak at TED .
"So we all make a ma@@ d d@@ as@@ h to that bo@@ ok@@ sh@@ el@@ f , because we feel like if we ar@@ en &apos;t trying everything , it &apos;s as if we &apos;re doing nothing and we &apos;re def@@ au@@ l@@ ting on our ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations to our kids ."
So it &apos;s hard enough to na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate our new ro@@ les as mo@@ thers and fa@@ thers .
Now ad@@ d to this problem something else : we are also na@@ vi@@ g@@ ating new ro@@ les as h@@ us@@ b@@ ands and wi@@ ves because most women today are in the wor@@ k@@ force .
"This is another reason , I think , that par@@ en@@ th@@ o@@ od feel@@ s like a cri@@ sis ."
"We have no ru@@ les , no sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts , no nor@@ ms for what to do when a child comes along now that both mo@@ m and d@@ ad are bre@@ ad@@ win@@ n@@ ers ."
"In fact , U@@ C@@ L@@ A re@@ cent@@ ly did a study looking at the most common con@@ fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation of family mem@@ bers in mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ clas@@ s hom@@ es ."
G@@ u@@ ess what it was ?
D@@ ad in a room by hi@@ m@@ self .
"T@@ od@@ ay , it is fa@@ thers , not mo@@ thers , who re@@ port the most wor@@ k@@ -@@ life con@@ fli@@ ct ."
"E@@ i@@ ther way , by the way , if you think it &apos;s hard for tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal fam@@ il@@ ies to sort out these new ro@@ les , just imagine what it &apos;s like now for n@@ on-@@ tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal fam@@ il@@ ies : fam@@ il@@ ies with two d@@ ads , fam@@ il@@ ies with two mom@@ s , sing@@ le@@ -@@ par@@ ent hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds ."
They are tru@@ ly impro@@ vi@@ sing as they go .
"Now , in a more pro@@ gre@@ s@@ sive country , and for@@ give me here for ca@@ pi@@ tu@@ lat@@ ing to cli@@ ch@@ é and inv@@ o@@ king , y@@ es , S@@ we@@ den , parents could re@@ ly on the state for sup@@ port ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , the United States is not one of them , so in case you were wonder@@ ing what the U.@@ S@@ ."
We are one of eight known countries that does not .
We are all the cu@@ st@@ od@@ i@@ ans of their self-@@ est@@ e@@ em .
"The one man@@ tra no par@@ ent ever questions is , &quot; All I want is for my children to be happy . &quot;"
And don &apos;t get me wrong : I think happ@@ iness is a wonderful go@@ al for a child .
But it is a very e@@ lu@@ sive one .
"H@@ app@@ iness and self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dence , teach@@ ing children that is not like teach@@ ing them how to p@@ low a fie@@ ld ."
It &apos;s not like teach@@ ing them how to ri@@ de a bi@@ ke .
There &apos;s no cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m for it .
"So , the first robot to talk about is called S@@ T@@ ri@@ D@@ E@@ R ."
It stan@@ ds for S@@ el@@ f-@@ exci@@ ted T@@ ri@@ pe@@ d@@ al D@@ y@@ na@@ mi@@ c E@@ x@@ per@@ im@@ ent@@ al Rob@@ ot .
"It &apos;s a robot that has three le@@ gs , which is inspi@@ red by nature ."
"But have you seen anything in nature , an ani@@ mal that has three le@@ gs ?"
"P@@ rob@@ ably not . So , why do I call this a biologi@@ cally inspi@@ red robot ? How would it work ?"
"But before that , let &apos;s look at po@@ p culture ."
"So , you know H@@ .@@ G@@ . W@@ el@@ ls &apos; &quot; &quot; W@@ ar of the Wor@@ l@@ ds , &quot; &quot; no@@ vel and movie ."
"And what you see over here is a very popul@@ ar video g@@ ame , and in this fi@@ ction they descri@@ be these al@@ ie@@ n cre@@ at@@ ures that are rob@@ ots that have three le@@ gs that ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ ze Earth ."
"But my robot , S@@ T@@ ri@@ D@@ E@@ R , does not move like this ."
"So , this is an ac@@ tu@@ al dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c si@@ mul@@ ation anim@@ ation ."
I &apos;m just going to show you how the robot works .
It fli@@ ps its body 1@@ 80 de@@ gre@@ es and it s@@ w@@ ings its le@@ g between the two le@@ gs and cat@@ ch@@ es the f@@ all .
"So , that &apos;s how it wal@@ ks . But when you look at us human being , bi@@ pe@@ d@@ al wal@@ king , what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re not really using a mus@@ cle to li@@ ft your le@@ g and walk like a robot . R@@ ight ?"
"What you &apos;re doing is you really s@@ w@@ ing your le@@ g and cat@@ ch the f@@ all , stand up again , s@@ w@@ ing your le@@ g and cat@@ ch the f@@ all ."
"You &apos;re using your buil@@ t-@@ in dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs , the physi@@ cs of your body , just like a pen@@ du@@ lu@@ m ."
We call that the con@@ cept of pas@@ sive dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c lo@@ com@@ oti@@ on .
"What you &apos;re doing is , when you stand up , poten@@ tial energy to kin@@ e@@ tic energy , poten@@ tial energy to kin@@ e@@ tic energy ."
It &apos;s a con@@ stan@@ tly fal@@ ling process .
"So , even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this , really , we were inspi@@ red by bio@@ logy and ap@@ pl@@ ying the prin@@ ci@@ ples of wal@@ king to this robot . Th@@ us it &apos;s a biologi@@ cally inspi@@ red robot ."
"What you see over here , this is what we want to do next ."
We want to f@@ old up the le@@ gs and sho@@ ot it up for lon@@ g@@ -@@ r@@ ange moti@@ on .
"And it de@@ plo@@ ys le@@ gs — it looks almost like &quot; &quot; St@@ ar W@@ ars &quot; &quot; — when it l@@ ands , it ab@@ sor@@ b@@ s the sho@@ ck and star@@ ts wal@@ king ."
"What you see over here , this y@@ el@@ low thing , this is not a death ra@@ y . ( Laughter ) This is just to show you that if you have cam@@ er@@ as or different typ@@ es of sen@@ sor@@ s — because it is t@@ all , it &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 8 me@@ ters t@@ all — you can see over ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les like bus@@ h@@ es and those kinds of things ."
So we have two pro@@ t@@ oty@@ p@@ es .
"The first ver@@ sion , in the back , that &apos;s S@@ T@@ ri@@ D@@ E@@ R I@@ ."
"The one in front , the s@@ mal@@ ler , is S@@ T@@ ri@@ D@@ E@@ R I@@ I ."
"The problem that we had with S@@ T@@ ri@@ D@@ E@@ R I is it was just too he@@ av@@ y in the body . We had so many mot@@ ors , you know , ali@@ g@@ ning the jo@@ in@@ ts , and those kinds of things ."
"So , we decided to syn@@ the@@ size a mechani@@ cal mechani@@ sm so we could get ri@@ d of all the mot@@ ors , and with a single mot@@ or we can co@@ ordin@@ ate all the moti@@ ons ."
"It &apos;s a mechani@@ cal solution to a problem , instead of using mech@@ at@@ ro@@ ni@@ cs ."
"So , with this now the top body is light enough . So , it &apos;s wal@@ king in our la@@ b ; this was the very first suc@@ cess@@ ful ste@@ p ."
It &apos;s still not perfe@@ cted — its co@@ f@@ fe@@ e fal@@ ls down — so we still have a lot of work to do .
The second robot I want to talk about is called I@@ M@@ P@@ A@@ S@@ S .
It stan@@ ds for In@@ te@@ lli@@ g@@ ent M@@ ob@@ i@@ lity P@@ lat@@ form with A@@ ctu@@ ated S@@ po@@ ke S@@ yst@@ em .
"So , it &apos;s a whe@@ el@@ -@@ le@@ g hy@@ bri@@ d robot ."
"So , think of a ri@@ m@@ less whe@@ el or a spo@@ ke whe@@ el , but the spo@@ k@@ es individu@@ ally move in and out of the hu@@ b ; so , it &apos;s a whe@@ el@@ -@@ le@@ g hy@@ bri@@ d ."
We are liter@@ ally re@@ -@@ inv@@ ent@@ ing the whe@@ el here .
Let me de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate how it works .
"So , in this video we &apos;re using an appro@@ ach called the re@@ ac@@ tive appro@@ ach ."
"J@@ ust simply using the t@@ acti@@ le sen@@ sor@@ s on the fe@@ et , it &apos;s trying to walk over a chang@@ ing ter@@ ra@@ in , a so@@ ft ter@@ ra@@ in where it p@@ us@@ h@@ es down and chang@@ es ."
"And just by the t@@ acti@@ le information , it suc@@ cess@@ fully cro@@ s@@ ses over these ty@@ pe of ter@@ ra@@ in ."
"But , when it en@@ coun@@ ters a very extre@@ me ter@@ ra@@ in , in this case , this ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le is more than three times the he@@ ight of the robot , Th@@ en it s@@ wit@@ ch@@ es to a deli@@ ber@@ ate mo@@ de , where it uses a las@@ er r@@ ange fin@@ der , and cam@@ era systems , to iden@@ ti@@ fy the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le and the size , and it pl@@ ans , car@@ e@@ fully pl@@ ans the moti@@ on of the spo@@ k@@ es and co@@ ordin@@ ates it so that it can show this kind of very very im@@ pres@@ sive mo@@ bility ."
You probably ha@@ ven &apos;t seen anything like this out there .
This is a very high mo@@ bility robot that we develo@@ ped called I@@ M@@ P@@ A@@ S@@ S .
"A@@ h , isn &apos;t that cool ?"
"When you dri@@ ve your car , when you ste@@ er your car , you use a meth@@ od called A@@ ck@@ er@@ man@@ n ste@@ ering ."
The front whe@@ els ro@@ t@@ ate like this .
"For most small whe@@ e@@ led rob@@ ots , they use a meth@@ od called differ@@ enti@@ al ste@@ ering where the left and right whe@@ el turns the op@@ posi@@ te dire@@ ction ."
"For I@@ M@@ P@@ A@@ S@@ S , we can do many , many different typ@@ es of moti@@ on ."
"For example , in this case , even though the left and right whe@@ el is conne@@ cted with a single ax@@ le ro@@ t@@ ating at the same ang@@ le of velo@@ city ."
We just simply change the len@@ g@@ th of the spo@@ ke .
"It af@@ fe@@ cts the di@@ am@@ e@@ ter and then can turn to the left , turn to the right ."
"So , these are just some exam@@ ples of the ne@@ at things that we can do with I@@ M@@ P@@ A@@ S@@ S ."
This robot is called C@@ L@@ I@@ M@@ Be@@ R : C@@ ab@@ le@@ -@@ s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded L@@ im@@ bed In@@ te@@ lli@@ g@@ ent M@@ at@@ ching Be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or Rob@@ ot .
"So , I &apos;ve been talking to a lot of N@@ A@@ SA J@@ P@@ L scienti@@ sts — at J@@ P@@ L they are fam@@ ous for the Mars ro@@ ver@@ s — and the scienti@@ sts , ge@@ ologi@@ sts always tell me that the real interesting science , the scien@@ ce@@ -@@ ri@@ ch si@@ tes , are always at the cli@@ f@@ f@@ s ."
But the cur@@ r@@ ent ro@@ ver@@ s cannot get there .
"So , inspi@@ red by that we wanted to build a robot that can clim@@ b a stru@@ ctu@@ red cli@@ ff environment ."
"So , this is C@@ L@@ I@@ M@@ Be@@ R ."
"So , what it does , it has three le@@ gs . It &apos;s probably difficult to see , but it has a win@@ ch and a c@@ able at the top — and it tries to figure out the best place to put its fo@@ ot ."
"And then once it figu@@ res that out in real time , it cal@@ cu@@ lat@@ es the force di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion : how much force it needs to ex@@ er@@ t to the surface so it doesn &apos;t ti@@ p and doesn &apos;t sli@@ p ."
"O@@ n@@ ce it st@@ abi@@ liz@@ es that , it li@@ f@@ ts a fo@@ ot , and then with the win@@ ch it can clim@@ b up these kinds of thing ."
Al@@ so for sear@@ ch and re@@ s@@ cu@@ e app@@ lic@@ ations as well .
F@@ i@@ ve years ago I actually worked at N@@ A@@ SA J@@ P@@ L during the sum@@ m@@ er as a fac@@ ul@@ ty fel@@ low .
And they already had a six leg@@ g@@ ed robot called L@@ E@@ M@@ U@@ R .
"So , this is actually based on that . This robot is called M@@ A@@ R@@ S : M@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ A@@ pp@@ en@@ d@@ age Rob@@ oti@@ c S@@ yst@@ em . So , it &apos;s a h@@ ex@@ a@@ pod robot ."
We develo@@ ped our ad@@ ap@@ tive ga@@ it plan@@ ner .
We actually have a very interesting pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad on there .
The students like to have fun . And here you can see that it &apos;s wal@@ king over un@@ stru@@ ctu@@ red ter@@ ra@@ in .
"It &apos;s trying to walk on the co@@ ar@@ se ter@@ ra@@ in , s@@ an@@ dy area , but depen@@ ding on the mo@@ i@@ stu@@ re cont@@ ent or the gra@@ in size of the s@@ and the fo@@ ot &apos;s so@@ il sin@@ k@@ age model chang@@ es ."
"So , it tries to ad@@ ap@@ t its ga@@ it to suc@@ cess@@ fully c@@ ross over these kind of things ."
"And also , it does some fun stuff , as can imagine ."
We get so many visi@@ t@@ ors visi@@ ting our la@@ b .
"So , when the visi@@ t@@ ors come , M@@ A@@ R@@ S wal@@ ks up to the computer , star@@ ts ty@@ ping &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ l@@ o , my name is M@@ A@@ R@@ S . &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to Ro@@ Me@@ L@@ a , the Rob@@ oti@@ cs M@@ ech@@ ani@@ s@@ ms L@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory at V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia T@@ e@@ ch ."
This robot is an a@@ mo@@ e@@ ba robot .
"Now , we don &apos;t have enough time to go into techni@@ cal de@@ ta@@ il@@ s , I &apos;ll just show you some of the experim@@ ents ."
"So , this is some of the early fe@@ a@@ si@@ bility experim@@ ents ."
We stor@@ e poten@@ tial energy to the el@@ a@@ stic sk@@ in to make it move .
O@@ r use an ac@@ tive ten@@ sion cor@@ ds to make it move forward and back@@ ward . It &apos;s called Ch@@ I@@ M@@ E@@ R@@ A .
We also have been working with some scienti@@ sts and engine@@ ers from U@@ P@@ en@@ n to come up with a chemi@@ cally ac@@ tu@@ ated ver@@ sion of this a@@ mo@@ e@@ ba robot .
"We do something to something And just like mag@@ ic , it mo@@ ves . The blo@@ b ."
This robot is a very re@@ cent project . It &apos;s called R@@ A@@ P@@ Ha@@ E@@ L .
Rob@@ oti@@ c A@@ ir Pow@@ er@@ ed H@@ and with E@@ la@@ stic L@@ ig@@ am@@ ents .
"There are a lot of really ne@@ at , very good rob@@ oti@@ c h@@ ands out there in the market ."
"The problem is they &apos;re just too ex@@ pen@@ sive , ten@@ s of thousands of dollars ."
"So , for pro@@ s@@ the@@ sis app@@ lic@@ ations it &apos;s probably not too prac@@ tical , because it &apos;s not af@@ for@@ d@@ able ."
We wanted to go t@@ ac@@ k@@ le this problem in a very different dire@@ ction .
"In@@ ste@@ ad of using electri@@ cal mot@@ ors , ele@@ c@@ tro@@ mechani@@ cal ac@@ tu@@ at@@ ors , we &apos;re using com@@ pres@@ sed air ."
We develo@@ ped these no@@ vel ac@@ tu@@ at@@ ors for jo@@ in@@ ts .
"It is comp@@ li@@ ant . You can actually change the force , simply just chang@@ ing the air pres@@ sure ."
And it can actually c@@ rus@@ h an em@@ p@@ ty s@@ od@@ a can .
"It can pi@@ ck up very de@@ lic@@ ate obje@@ cts like a ra@@ w e@@ g@@ g , or in this case , a li@@ gh@@ t@@ bu@@ l@@ b ."
"The best part , it took only $ 2@@ 00 dollars to make the first pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pe ."
"This robot is actually a family of s@@ na@@ ke rob@@ ots that we call H@@ y@@ D@@ R@@ A@@ S , H@@ y@@ per De@@ gre@@ es@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ fre@@ e@@ dom Rob@@ oti@@ c Ar@@ ti@@ cu@@ lated S@@ er@@ p@@ ent@@ ine ."
This is a robot that can clim@@ b stru@@ ctures .
This is a H@@ y@@ D@@ R@@ A@@ S &apos;s ar@@ m .
It &apos;s a 12 de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom rob@@ oti@@ c ar@@ m .
But the cool part is the us@@ er inter@@ face .
"The c@@ able over there , that &apos;s an op@@ tical fi@@ ber ."
"And this stud@@ ent , probably the first time using it , but she can arti@@ cul@@ ate it many different ways ."
"So , for example in I@@ ra@@ q , you know , the war z@@ one , there is ro@@ ad@@ side b@@ om@@ b@@ s . C@@ ur@@ r@@ ently you sen@@ d these re@@ mot@@ ely contro@@ l@@ led ve@@ hi@@ cles that are ar@@ med ."
It takes really a lot of time and it &apos;s ex@@ pen@@ sive to tra@@ in the oper@@ ator to oper@@ ate this comple@@ x ar@@ m .
"In this case it &apos;s very in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive ; this stud@@ ent , probably his first time using it , doing very comple@@ x m@@ ani@@ pul@@ ation t@@ as@@ ks , pi@@ c@@ king up obje@@ cts and doing m@@ ani@@ pul@@ ation , just like that . V@@ ery in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive ."
"Now , this robot is cur@@ r@@ ently our st@@ ar robot ."
"We actually have a f@@ an c@@ lub for the robot , D@@ A@@ R@@ w@@ In : D@@ y@@ na@@ mi@@ c An@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ mor@@ phi@@ c Rob@@ ot with In@@ te@@ lli@@ g@@ ence ."
"As you know , we are very interested in hum@@ an@@ o@@ id robot , human wal@@ king , so we decided to build a small hum@@ an@@ o@@ id robot ."
"This was in 200@@ 4 ; at that time , this was something really , really re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary ."
This was more of a fe@@ a@@ si@@ bility study : What kind of mot@@ ors should we use ?
Is it even possible ? What kinds of contro@@ ls should we do ?
"So , this does not have any sen@@ sor@@ s ."
"So , it &apos;s an open loo@@ p control ."
"For those who probably know , if you don &apos;t have any sen@@ sor@@ s and there are any di@@ st@@ ur@@ ban@@ ces , you know what happens ."
"( Laughter ) So , based on that suc@@ cess , the fol@@ low@@ ing year we did the pro@@ per mechani@@ cal design star@@ ting from kin@@ em@@ ati@@ cs ."
"And th@@ us , D@@ A@@ R@@ w@@ In I was born in 200@@ 5 ."
"It stan@@ ds up , it wal@@ ks — very im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , still , as you can see , it has a cor@@ d , um@@ bi@@ li@@ cal cor@@ d . So , we &apos;re still using an ex@@ ter@@ na@@ l power source and ex@@ ter@@ na@@ l compu@@ tation ."
"So , in 200@@ 6 , now it &apos;s really time to have fun ."
"L@@ et &apos;s give it inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence . We give it all the compu@@ ting power it needs : a 1@@ .@@ 5 gi@@ ga@@ her@@ t@@ z P@@ enti@@ um M chi@@ p , two F@@ i@@ re@@ Wi@@ re cam@@ er@@ as , r@@ ate g@@ y@@ ro@@ s , ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ome@@ ters , four force sen@@ sor@@ s on the fo@@ ot , li@@ thi@@ um po@@ ly@@ m@@ er bat@@ ter@@ ies ."
And now D@@ A@@ R@@ w@@ In I@@ I is completely au@@ ton@@ om@@ ous .
It is not re@@ mot@@ e contro@@ l@@ led .
"There are no te@@ thers . It looks around , sear@@ ch@@ es for the ball , looks around , sear@@ ch@@ es for the ball , and it tries to play a g@@ ame of so@@ c@@ cer , au@@ ton@@ om@@ ously : arti@@ fi@@ cial inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence ."
"L@@ et &apos;s see how it does . This was our very first tri@@ al , and ... S@@ pe@@ ct@@ at@@ ors ( V@@ ide@@ o ) : Go@@ al !"
"D@@ en@@ n@@ is H@@ ong : So , there is actually a compe@@ ti@@ tion called Rob@@ o@@ C@@ up ."
I don &apos;t know how many of you have heard about Rob@@ o@@ C@@ up .
It &apos;s an inter@@ national au@@ ton@@ om@@ ous robot so@@ c@@ cer compe@@ ti@@ tion .
"And the go@@ al of Rob@@ o@@ C@@ up , the ac@@ tu@@ al go@@ al is , by the year 20@@ 50 we want to have full size , au@@ ton@@ om@@ ous hum@@ an@@ o@@ id rob@@ ots play so@@ c@@ cer against the human World C@@ up ch@@ am@@ pi@@ ons and wi@@ n ."
"It &apos;s a true ac@@ tu@@ al go@@ al . It &apos;s a very am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous go@@ al , but we tru@@ ly believe that we can do it ."
"So , this is last year in China ."
We were the very first team in the United States that qu@@ ali@@ f@@ ied in the hum@@ an@@ o@@ id Rob@@ o@@ C@@ up compe@@ ti@@ tion .
This is this year in Au@@ stri@@ a .
"You &apos;re going to see the action , three against three , completely au@@ ton@@ om@@ ous ."
There you go . Yes !
The rob@@ ots tr@@ ack and they team play am@@ on@@ g@@ st themselves .
It &apos;s very im@@ pres@@ sive . It &apos;s really a research ev@@ ent pac@@ k@@ aged in a more exci@@ ting compe@@ ti@@ tion ev@@ ent .
"What you see over here , this is the beautiful L@@ ou@@ is V@@ u@@ it@@ ton C@@ up tro@@ ph@@ y ."
"So , this is for the best hum@@ an@@ o@@ id , and we would like to bring this for the very first time , to the United States next year , so wi@@ sh us lu@@ ck ."
( Applause ) Thank you .
D@@ A@@ R@@ w@@ In also has a lot of other tal@@ ents .
L@@ ast year it actually con@@ du@@ cted the Ro@@ an@@ o@@ ke Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony O@@ r@@ ch@@ est@@ ra for the ho@@ li@@ day con@@ cer@@ t .
"This is the next gener@@ ation robot , D@@ A@@ R@@ w@@ In IV , but s@@ mar@@ ter , f@@ ast@@ er , stron@@ ger ."
"And it &apos;s trying to show off its ability : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m mach@@ o , I &apos;m stron@@ g ."
"I can also do some J@@ ac@@ kie Ch@@ an@@ -@@ moti@@ on , mar@@ tial art mov@@ em@@ ents . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it wal@@ ks away . So , this is D@@ A@@ R@@ w@@ In IV ."
"And again , you &apos;ll be able to see it in the lob@@ by ."
"We tru@@ ly believe this is going to be the very first ru@@ n@@ ning hum@@ an@@ o@@ id robot in the United States . So , st@@ ay tu@@ ned ."
All right . So I show@@ ed you some of our exci@@ ting rob@@ ots at work .
"So , what is the se@@ cre@@ t of our suc@@ cess ?"
W@@ here do we come up with these ideas ?
How do we develo@@ p these kinds of ideas ?
We have a fully au@@ ton@@ om@@ ous ve@@ hi@@ cle that can dri@@ ve into urb@@ an environ@@ ments . We won a half a million dollars in the D@@ A@@ R@@ P@@ A U@@ r@@ b@@ an Ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge .
We also have the world &apos;s very first ve@@ hi@@ cle that can be dri@@ ven by the bl@@ ind .
"We call it the B@@ l@@ ind D@@ ri@@ ver Ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge , very exci@@ ting ."
"And many , many other rob@@ oti@@ cs proje@@ cts I want to talk about ."
These are just the aw@@ ar@@ ds that we won in 200@@ 7 f@@ all from rob@@ oti@@ cs compe@@ ti@@ tions and those kinds of things .
"So , really , we have five se@@ cre@@ ts ."
F@@ ir@@ st is : W@@ here do we get in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation ?
W@@ here do we get this sp@@ ar@@ k of imag@@ in@@ ation ?
"This is a true story , my per@@ s@@ onal story ."
"A@@ t night when I go to bed , 3 - 4 a@@ .@@ m@@ . in the morning , I lie down , close my eyes , and I see these lin@@ es and cir@@ cles and different sha@@ p@@ es flo@@ ating around ."
"And they as@@ se@@ m@@ ble , and they form these kinds of mechani@@ s@@ ms ."
"And then I think , &quot; &quot; A@@ h this is cool . &quot; &quot; So , right next to my bed I keep a not@@ e@@ book , a jour@@ na@@ l , with a spe@@ cial p@@ en that has a light on it , L@@ E@@ D light , because I don &apos;t want to turn on the light and wa@@ ke up my wi@@ fe ."
"So , I see this , sc@@ ri@@ b@@ ble everything down , dra@@ w things , and I go to bed ."
"E@@ very day in the morning , the first thing I do before my first cu@@ p of co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , before I br@@ us@@ h my te@@ e@@ th , I open my not@@ e@@ book ."
"M@@ any times it &apos;s em@@ p@@ ty , sometimes I have something there — if something &apos;s there , sometimes it &apos;s j@@ un@@ k — but most of the time I can &apos;t even read my hand@@ writing ."
"And so , 4 am in the morning , what do you expe@@ ct , right ?"
"So , I need to deci@@ ph@@ er what I wro@@ te ."
"But sometimes I see this ing@@ eni@@ ous idea in there , and I have this e@@ u@@ re@@ ka moment ."
"I dire@@ ct@@ ly run to my home offi@@ ce , si@@ t at my computer , I ty@@ pe in the ideas , I sk@@ et@@ ch things out and I keep a d@@ at@@ ab@@ ase of ideas ."
"So , when we have these cal@@ ls for pro@@ pos@@ als , I try to find a mat@@ ch between my poten@@ tial ideas and the problem . If there is a mat@@ ch we write a research pro@@ pos@@ al , get the research fun@@ ding in , and that &apos;s how we start our research progra@@ ms ."
But just a sp@@ ar@@ k of imag@@ in@@ ation is not good enough .
How do we develo@@ p these kinds of ideas ?
"A@@ t our la@@ b Ro@@ Me@@ L@@ a , the Rob@@ oti@@ cs and M@@ ech@@ ani@@ s@@ ms L@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory , we have these fanta@@ stic bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming s@@ es@@ sions ."
"So , we ga@@ ther around , we di@@ sc@@ us@@ s about problems and social problems and talk about it ."
But before we start we set this g@@ ol@@ den ru@@ le .
The ru@@ le is : N@@ ob@@ ody cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ es any@@ body &apos;s ideas .
N@@ ob@@ ody cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ es any op@@ ini@@ on .
"This is important , because many times students , they fe@@ ar or they feel un@@ comfor@@ table how others might think about their op@@ ini@@ ons and thou@@ ghts ."
"So , once you do this , it is amazing how the students open up ."
"They have these w@@ ac@@ k@@ y , cool , c@@ razy , bri@@ lli@@ ant ideas , and the whole room is just electri@@ f@@ ied with cre@@ ative energy ."
And this is how we develo@@ p our ideas .
"Well , we &apos;re ru@@ n@@ ning out of time . One more thing I want to talk about is , you know , just a sp@@ ar@@ k of idea and develo@@ pment is not good enough ."
"There was a great TED moment , I think it was S@@ ir K@@ en Rob@@ in@@ son , was it ?"
He gave a talk about how education and school kil@@ ls cre@@ ati@@ vity .
"Well , actually , there are two si@@ des to the story ."
"So , there is only so much one can do with just ing@@ eni@@ ous ideas and cre@@ ati@@ vity and good engine@@ ering in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion ."
"If you want to go be@@ y@@ ond a t@@ in@@ k@@ ering , if you want to go be@@ y@@ ond a h@@ ob@@ by of rob@@ oti@@ cs and really t@@ ac@@ k@@ le the gr@@ and challen@@ ges of rob@@ oti@@ cs through ri@@ go@@ rou@@ s research we need more than that . This is where school comes in ."
"B@@ at@@ man , fi@@ gh@@ ting against bad guys , he has his u@@ ti@@ lity be@@ l@@ t , he has his gra@@ p@@ pl@@ ing ho@@ ok , he has all different kinds of g@@ ad@@ gets ."
"For us rob@@ oti@@ ci@@ sts , engine@@ ers and scienti@@ sts , these to@@ ols , these are the cour@@ ses and clas@@ ses you take in clas@@ s ."
"M@@ ath , differ@@ enti@@ al equ@@ ations ."
"I have lin@@ e@@ ar al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , science , physi@@ cs , even now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , chemi@@ stry and bio@@ logy , as you &apos;ve seen ."
These are all the to@@ ols that we need .
"So , the more to@@ ols you have , for B@@ at@@ man , more effe@@ ctive at fi@@ gh@@ ting the bad guys , for us , more to@@ ols to att@@ ack these kinds of big problems ."
"So , education is very important ."
"A@@ l@@ so , it &apos;s not about that , only about that . You also have to work really , really hard ."
"So , I always tell my students , &quot; W@@ ork s@@ mar@@ t , then work hard . &quot;"
This picture in the back this is 3 a@@ .@@ m@@ . in the morning .
"I gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e if you come to your la@@ b at 3 - 4 am we have students working there , not because I tell them to , but because we are having too much fun ."
Wh@@ ich le@@ ads to the last top@@ ic : Do not for@@ get to have fun .
"That &apos;s really the se@@ cre@@ t of our suc@@ cess , we &apos;re having too much fun ."
"I tru@@ ly believe that high@@ est produ@@ cti@@ vity comes when you &apos;re having fun , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing ."
There you go . Thank you so much .
( Applause )
P@@ u@@ z@@ z@@ les and mag@@ ic .
"I work in what most people think are two di@@ st@@ in@@ ct fie@@ l@@ ds , but I believe they are the same ."
And I believe that mag@@ ic and pu@@ z@@ z@@ les are the same because they both key into one of the most important human dri@@ ves : the ur@@ ge to sol@@ ve .
"H@@ um@@ an be@@ ings are wi@@ red to sol@@ ve , to make order out of cha@@ os ."
I &apos;ve been sol@@ ving my whole life .
"When you do the cro@@ s@@ s@@ word pu@@ z@@ z@@ le or when you wat@@ ch a mag@@ ic show , you become a sol@@ ver , and your go@@ al is to try to find the order in the cha@@ os , the cha@@ os of , say , a bl@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ white pu@@ z@@ z@@ le g@@ ri@@ d , a mi@@ x@@ ed@@ -@@ up ba@@ g of S@@ c@@ ra@@ b@@ ble ti@@ les , or a sh@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ led p@@ ack of playing car@@ ds ."
"And today , as a c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ver@@ b@@ ali@@ st — 2@@ 3 poin@@ ts — and an il@@ lu@@ sion desig@@ ner , I create that cha@@ os ."
I test your ability to sol@@ ve .
It &apos;s re@@ mark@@ able .
But many other cul@@ tu@@ res have their sig@@ nature pu@@ z@@ z@@ les as well .
"Ch@@ ina gi@@ ves us t@@ ang@@ ra@@ ms , which would test sol@@ ver@@ s &apos; abi@@ lit@@ ies to form sha@@ p@@ es from the j@@ um@@ b@@ led pie@@ ces ."
Is this not making order out of cha@@ os ?
"So as you can see , we are always sol@@ ving ."
We are always trying to dec@@ od@@ e our world .
It &apos;s an e@@ ter@@ na@@ l qu@@ est .
"It &apos;s just like the one C@@ er@@ v@@ an@@ tes wro@@ te about in &quot; &quot; D@@ on Q@@ u@@ i@@ x@@ ot@@ e , &quot; &quot; which by the way is the ro@@ ot of the word &quot; &quot; qui@@ x@@ ot@@ ry , &quot; &quot; the high@@ est@@ -@@ sc@@ or@@ ing S@@ c@@ ra@@ b@@ ble word of all time , 3@@ 6@@ 5 poin@@ ts ."
I &apos;m seeing some he@@ ads no@@ d .
"C@@ ome on guys , really ?"
Wh@@ o &apos;s read &quot; &quot; D@@ on Q@@ u@@ i@@ x@@ ot@@ e ? &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do this . R@@ a@@ ise your h@@ ands if you &apos;ve read &quot; &quot; D@@ on Q@@ u@@ i@@ x@@ ot@@ e . &quot; &quot; There we go . S@@ mar@@ t audience .
Wh@@ o &apos;s read &quot; &quot; D@@ on Q@@ u@@ i@@ x@@ ot@@ e ? &quot; &quot; G@@ et them up .
Let &apos;s see .
E@@ very@@ body &apos;s looking away all of a sud@@ den .
C@@ an I ? W@@ ould you ? What is your name ? G@@ w@@ en .
"I &apos;m not a mind re@@ a@@ der , I can see your name ta@@ g ."
"C@@ ome with me , G@@ w@@ en . E@@ very@@ one give her a round of ap@@ plause , make her feel wel@@ come ."
"G@@ w@@ en , after you ."
( Applause ) A@@ re you so exci@@ ted ?
But I &apos;m going to go over here .
I don &apos;t want to see what you &apos;re doing .
"O@@ kay , so don &apos;t start yet ."
W@@ a@@ it for me to get over here and close my eyes .
"B@@ i@@ g , big , big stro@@ k@@ es . Go@@ od , good ."
"D@@ id I for@@ get ? Oh , I for@@ got my pur@@ ple mark@@ er ."
"@@ Yes , I think it does ."
"So l@@ ad@@ ies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , how is this possible ?"
Well this is the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le I present to you .
C@@ ould there be order in the cha@@ os that I created ?
That one &apos;s my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te .
And then we had an experim@@ ent with a sil@@ ver o@@ x .
"Th@@ ank you , K@@ aty , for taking that ph@@ oto for me ."
"I believe you co@@ lo@@ red a red d@@ on@@ key , G@@ w@@ en ."
There &apos;s more .

Thank you .

I &apos;m here today re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing a team of arti@@ sts and technologi@@ sts and fil@@ m@@ mak@@ ers that worked together on a re@@ mark@@ able film project for the last four years .
And along the way they created a bre@@ ak@@ through in computer vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ ation .
So I want to show you a cli@@ p of the film now .
H@@ op@@ e@@ fully it won &apos;t stu@@ t@@ ter .
"And if we did our j@@ ob@@ s well , you won &apos;t know that we were even inv@@ olved ."
V@@ o@@ ice ( V@@ ide@@ o ) : I don &apos;t know how it &apos;s possible ...
but you se@@ em to have more ha@@ ir .
Bra@@ d P@@ it@@ t : What if I told you that I wasn &apos;t getting ol@@ der ...
but I was getting youn@@ ger than everybody else ?
I was born with some form of dise@@ ase .
V@@ o@@ ice : What kind of dise@@ ase ?
B@@ P : I was born old .
M@@ an : I &apos;m sor@@ ry .
B@@ P : No need to be . There &apos;s nothing wrong with old age .
G@@ ir@@ l : A@@ re you si@@ ck ?
"B@@ P : I heard mom@@ ma and Ti@@ z@@ zy whi@@ sp@@ er , and they said I was g@@ on@@ na die so@@ on ."
But ... maybe not .
G@@ ir@@ l : You &apos;re different than any@@ body I &apos;ve ever met .
B@@ B : There were many chang@@ es ...
"@@ some you could see , some you couldn &apos;t ."
"H@@ air started grow@@ ing in all sor@@ ts of places , along with other things ."
"I felt pretty good , consi@@ der@@ ing ."
"E@@ d U@@ l@@ bri@@ ch : That was a cli@@ p from &quot; &quot; The C@@ u@@ ri@@ ous C@@ ase of B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in Bu@@ t@@ ton . &quot; &quot; M@@ any of you , maybe you &apos;ve seen it or you &apos;ve heard of the story , but what you might not know is that for ne@@ ar@@ ly the first hour of the film , the ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ter , B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in Bu@@ t@@ ton , who &apos;s pla@@ yed by Bra@@ d P@@ it@@ t , is completely compu@@ ter@@ -@@ gener@@ ated from the ne@@ ck up ."
"Now , there &apos;s no use of pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic mak@@ e@@ up or photograph@@ y of Bra@@ d super@@ im@@ posed over another ac@@ tor &apos;s body ."
We &apos;ve created a completely di@@ gi@@ tal human head .
So I &apos;d like to start with a little bit of history on the project .
This is based on an F@@ . S@@ c@@ ot@@ t F@@ it@@ zg@@ er@@ al@@ d shor@@ t story .
It &apos;s about a man who &apos;s born old and lives his life in re@@ verse .
"Now , this movie has flo@@ ated around H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood for well over half a century , and we first got inv@@ olved with the project in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s , with R@@ on H@@ ow@@ ard as the dire@@ ctor ."
We took a lot of me@@ et@@ ings and we seri@@ ously consi@@ der@@ ed it .
But at the time we had to th@@ row in the tow@@ el .
It was de@@ em@@ ed im@@ possible .
It was be@@ y@@ ond the technology of the day to de@@ pi@@ ct a man ag@@ ing back@@ war@@ ds .
"The human form , in particular the human head , has been consi@@ der@@ ed the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il of our indu@@ stry ."
"The project came back to us about a dec@@ ade later , and this time with a dire@@ ctor na@@ med Davi@@ d F@@ in@@ ch@@ er ."
"Now , F@@ in@@ ch@@ er is an interesting guy ."
"D@@ avi@@ d is fe@@ ar@@ less of technology , and he is absolu@@ tely ten@@ aci@@ ous ."
"And Davi@@ d won &apos;t take &quot; &quot; no . &quot; &quot; And Davi@@ d belie@@ ved , like we do in the vi@@ su@@ al effe@@ cts indu@@ stry , that anything is possible as long as you have enough time , re@@ sources and , of course , money ."
"And so Davi@@ d had an interesting take on the film , and he thre@@ w a challen@@ ge at us ."
He wanted the ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ter of the film to be pla@@ yed from the c@@ ra@@ d@@ le to the gra@@ ve by one ac@@ tor .
It happened to be this guy .
"We went through a process of e@@ li@@ min@@ ation and a process of disco@@ very with Davi@@ d , and we ru@@ led out , of course , s@@ wa@@ pping ac@@ t@@ ors ."
"That was one idea : that we would have different ac@@ t@@ ors , and we would hand off from ac@@ tor to ac@@ tor ."
We even ru@@ led out the idea of using mak@@ e@@ up .
"We realized that pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic mak@@ e@@ up just wouldn &apos;t h@@ old up , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly in clo@@ se@@ -@@ up ."
And mak@@ e@@ up is an ad@@ di@@ tive process . You have to build the face up .
And Davi@@ d wanted to car@@ ve de@@ e@@ ply into Bra@@ d &apos;s face to bring the ag@@ ing to this char@@ ac@@ ter .
He needed to be a very sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic char@@ ac@@ ter .
"So we decided to c@@ ast a ser@@ ies of little people that would play the different bod@@ ies of B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in at the different incre@@ ments of his life and that we would in fact create a compu@@ ter@@ -@@ gener@@ ated ver@@ sion of Bra@@ d &apos;s head , aged to ap@@ pe@@ ar as B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in , and att@@ ach that to the body of the real ac@@ tor ."
S@@ oun@@ ded great .
"O@@ f course , this was the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il of our indu@@ stry , and the fact that this guy is a global i@@ c@@ on didn &apos;t help either , because I &apos;m sure if any of you ever stand in line at the gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e , you know — we see his face con@@ stan@@ tly ."
So there really was no t@@ ol@@ er@@ able mar@@ g@@ in of er@@ ro@@ r .
There were two studi@@ os inv@@ olved : W@@ ar@@ ner B@@ ro@@ thers and Par@@ amount .
"And they both belie@@ ved this would make an amazing film , of course , but it was a very high-@@ ri@@ sk pro@@ posi@@ tion ."
There was lots of money and re@@ pu@@ t@@ ations at st@@ ake .
But we belie@@ ved that we had a very so@@ li@@ d meth@@ od@@ o@@ logy that might work ...
"But des@@ pi@@ te our ver@@ b@@ al as@@ su@@ ran@@ ces , they wanted some pro@@ of ."
"And so , in 200@@ 4 , they com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed us to do a scre@@ en test of B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in ."
And we did it in about five weeks .
But we used lots of che@@ ats and shor@@ t@@ cu@@ ts .
We basically put something together to get through the me@@ e@@ ting .
I &apos;ll ro@@ ll that for you now . This was the first test for B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in Bu@@ t@@ ton .
"And in here , you can see , that &apos;s a compu@@ ter@@ -@@ gener@@ ated head — pretty good — att@@ ach@@ ed to the body of an ac@@ tor ."
And it worked . And it gave the studi@@ o great re@@ lie@@ f .
"A@@ f@@ ter many years of star@@ ts and stop@@ s on this project , and making that t@@ ough deci@@ sion , they finally decided to gre@@ en@@ light the movie ."
"And I can remember , actually , when I got the phone call to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate us , to say the movie was a go , I actually thre@@ w up ."
"( Laughter ) You know , this is some t@@ ough stuff ."
"So we started to have early team me@@ et@@ ings , and we got everybody together , and it was really more like ther@@ ap@@ y in the beginning , con@@ v@@ in@@ cing each other and reas@@ sur@@ ing each other that we could actually under@@ take this ."
We had to h@@ old up an hour of a movie with a char@@ ac@@ ter .
And it &apos;s not a spe@@ cial effe@@ cts film ; it has to be a man .
We really felt like we were in a — kind of a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ ste@@ p program .
"And of course , the first ste@@ p is : ad@@ m@@ it you &apos;ve got a problem . ( Laughter ) So we had a big problem : we didn &apos;t know how we were going to do this ."
But we did know one thing .
"Be@@ ing from the vi@@ su@@ al effe@@ cts indu@@ stry , we , with Davi@@ d , belie@@ ved that we now had enough time , enough re@@ sources , and , God , we hop@@ ed we had enough money ."
And we had enough pas@@ sion to will the pro@@ cess@@ es and technology into ex@@ ist@@ ence .
"So , when you &apos;re fac@@ ed with something like that , of course you &apos;ve got to bre@@ ak it down ."
You take the big problem and you bre@@ ak it down into s@@ mal@@ ler pie@@ ces and you start to att@@ ack that .
So we had three ma@@ in are@@ as that we had to fo@@ cus on .
We needed to make Bra@@ d look a lot ol@@ der — needed to age him 4@@ 5 years or so .
"And we also needed to make sure that we could take Bra@@ d &apos;s i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ c@@ ra@@ s@@ ies , his little ti@@ cs , the little sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties that make him who he is and have that trans@@ l@@ ate through our process so that it ap@@ pe@@ ars in B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in on the scre@@ en ."
"And we also needed to create a char@@ ac@@ ter that could h@@ old up under , really , all con@@ di@@ tions ."
"He needed to be able to walk in bro@@ ad da@@ y@@ light , at ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time , under c@@ and@@ le@@ light , he had to h@@ old an extre@@ me clo@@ se@@ -@@ up , he had to deli@@ ver di@@ al@@ og@@ ue , he had to be able to run , he had to be able to s@@ we@@ at , he had to be able to take a b@@ ath , to c@@ ry , he even had to th@@ row up ."
"N@@ ot all at the same time — but he had to , you know , do all of those things ."
And the work had to h@@ old up for almost the first hour of the movie .
We did about 3@@ 25 sh@@ ots .
So we needed a system that would al@@ low B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in to do everything a human being can do .
And we realized that there was a gi@@ ant ch@@ as@@ m between the state of the art of technology in 200@@ 4 and where we needed it to be .
So we fo@@ c@@ used on moti@@ on cap@@ ture .
I &apos;m sure many of you have seen moti@@ on cap@@ ture .
The state of the art at the time was something called mark@@ er@@ -@@ based moti@@ on cap@@ ture .
I &apos;ll give you an example here .
"It &apos;s basically the idea of , you we@@ ar a le@@ ot@@ ard , and they put some ref@@ le@@ ctive mark@@ ers on your body , and instead of using cam@@ er@@ as , there &apos;re in@@ fr@@ ared sen@@ sor@@ s around a v@@ olu@@ me , and those in@@ fr@@ ared sen@@ sor@@ s tr@@ ack the thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal posi@@ tion of those mark@@ ers in real time ."
And then ani@@ mat@@ ors can take the data of the moti@@ on of those mark@@ ers and app@@ ly them to a compu@@ ter@@ -@@ gener@@ ated char@@ ac@@ ter .
You can see the computer char@@ ac@@ ters on the right are having the same comple@@ x moti@@ on as the dan@@ c@@ ers .
"But we also looked at num@@ bers of other fil@@ ms at the time that were using fac@@ i@@ al mark@@ er trac@@ king , and that &apos;s the idea of pu@@ tting mark@@ ers on the human face and doing the same process ."
"And as you can see , it gi@@ ves you a pretty c@@ ra@@ pp@@ y perform@@ ance ."
That &apos;s not terri@@ bly compe@@ l@@ ling .
And what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the mark@@ ers .
We needed the sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties of the sk@@ in .
We needed to see sk@@ in moving over mus@@ cle moving over b@@ one .
We needed cre@@ ases and di@@ m@@ ples and w@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ les and all of those things .
"O@@ ur first re@@ v@@ el@@ ation was to completely ab@@ or@@ t and walk away from the technology of the day , the stat@@ us qu@@ o , the state of the art ."
So we ab@@ or@@ ted using moti@@ on cap@@ ture .
"And we were now well out of our comfor@@ t z@@ one , and in un@@ char@@ ted terri@@ t@@ ory ."
So we were left with this idea that we en@@ ded up cal@@ ling &quot; &quot; technology ste@@ w . &quot; &quot; We started to look out in other fie@@ l@@ ds .
"The idea was that we were going to find nu@@ g@@ gets or g@@ em@@ s of technology that come from other indu@@ str@@ ies like medi@@ cal imag@@ ing , the video g@@ ame space , and re@@ -@@ appro@@ pri@@ ate them ."
And we had to create kind of a sa@@ u@@ ce .
And the sa@@ u@@ ce was c@@ od@@ e in so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that we &apos;d wri@@ t@@ ten to al@@ low these disp@@ ar@@ ate pie@@ ces of technology to come together and work as one .
"I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ally , we came across some re@@ mark@@ able research done by a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man na@@ med D@@ r. P@@ au@@ l E@@ k@@ man in the early &apos; 7@@ 0s ."
"He belie@@ ved that he could , in fact , cat@@ al@@ o@@ g the human face ."
"And he came up with this idea of F@@ aci@@ al A@@ ction C@@ od@@ ing S@@ yst@@ em , or F@@ A@@ C@@ S ."
"He belie@@ ved that there were 70 basi@@ c pos@@ es or sha@@ p@@ es of the human face , and that those basi@@ c pos@@ es or sha@@ p@@ es of the face can be com@@ b@@ ined to create in@@ fini@@ te possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies of everything the human face is cap@@ able of doing ."
"And of course , these tran@@ sc@@ end age , rac@@ e , culture , gen@@ der ."
So this became the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of our research as we went forward .
And then we came across some re@@ mark@@ able technology called Con@@ t@@ our .
And here you can see a sub@@ je@@ ct having ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us mak@@ e@@ up sti@@ pp@@ led on her face .
And now what we &apos;re looking at is really cre@@ ating a surface cap@@ ture as op@@ posed to a mark@@ er cap@@ ture .
"The sub@@ je@@ ct stan@@ ds in front of a computer ar@@ ra@@ y of cam@@ er@@ as , and those cam@@ er@@ as can , fra@@ me@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ fra@@ me , re@@ con@@ stru@@ ct the ge@@ ome@@ try of exactly what the sub@@ je@@ ct &apos;s doing at the moment ."
"So , effe@@ cti@@ vely , you get 3@@ D data in real time of the sub@@ je@@ ct ."
"And if you look in a com@@ par@@ is@@ on , on the left , we see what v@@ olu@@ me@@ tri@@ c data gi@@ ves us and on the right you see what mark@@ ers give us ."
"So , c@@ lear@@ ly , we were in a sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally better place for this ."
"But these were the early days of this technology , and it wasn &apos;t really pro@@ ven yet ."
We meas@@ ure comple@@ x@@ ity and fi@@ de@@ lity of data in terms of po@@ ly@@ g@@ onal coun@@ t .
"And so , on the left , we were seeing 10@@ 0,000 po@@ ly@@ g@@ ons ."
We could go up into the mi@@ llions of po@@ ly@@ g@@ ons .
It seem@@ ed to be in@@ fini@@ te .
This was when we had our &quot; &quot; A@@ h@@ a ! &quot; &quot; This was the bre@@ ak@@ through .
"This is when we &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; OK , we &apos;re going to be OK , This is actually going to work . &quot; &quot; And the &quot; &quot; A@@ h@@ a ! &quot; &quot; was , what if we could take Bra@@ d P@@ it@@ t , and we could put Bra@@ d in this de@@ vice , and use this Con@@ t@@ our process , and we could sti@@ pp@@ le on this ph@@ o@@ sp@@ ho@@ re@@ sc@@ ent mak@@ e@@ up and put him under the black li@@ ghts , and we could , in fact , s@@ can him in real time perform@@ ing E@@ k@@ man &apos;s F@@ A@@ C@@ S pos@@ es ."
"R@@ ight ? So , effe@@ cti@@ vely , we en@@ ded up with a 3@@ D d@@ at@@ ab@@ ase of everything Bra@@ d P@@ it@@ t &apos;s face is cap@@ able of doing ."
"( Laughter ) F@@ ro@@ m there , we actually car@@ ved up those fac@@ es into s@@ mal@@ ler pie@@ ces and com@@ pon@@ ents of his face ."
"So we en@@ ded up with liter@@ ally thousands and thousands and thousands of sha@@ p@@ es , a comple@@ te d@@ at@@ ab@@ ase of all possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies that his face is cap@@ able of doing ."
"Now , that &apos;s great , ex@@ cept we had him at age 4@@ 4 ."
We need to put another 40 years on him at this point .
"We brought in Ri@@ ck B@@ ak@@ er , and Ri@@ ck is one of the great mak@@ e@@ up and spe@@ cial effe@@ cts gu@@ ru@@ s of our indu@@ stry ."
"And we also brought in a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man na@@ med K@@ az@@ u T@@ s@@ uj@@ i , and K@@ az@@ u T@@ s@@ uj@@ i is one of the great ph@@ ot@@ ore@@ ali@@ st s@@ cul@@ p@@ t@@ ors of our time ."
"And we com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed them to make a ma@@ qu@@ et@@ te , or a b@@ ust , of B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in ."
"So , in the sp@@ ir@@ it of &quot; &quot; The Gre@@ at U@@ n@@ ve@@ il@@ ing &quot; &quot; — I had to do this — I had to un@@ ve@@ il something ."
So this is B@@ en 80 .
"We created three of these : there &apos;s B@@ en 80 , there &apos;s B@@ en 70 , there &apos;s B@@ en 60 ."
And this really became the tem@@ pl@@ ate for moving forward .
"Now , this was made from a life c@@ ast of Bra@@ d ."
"So , in fact , an@@ at@@ omi@@ cally , it is cor@@ re@@ ct ."
"The eyes , the ja@@ w , the te@@ e@@ th : everything is in perfe@@ ct ali@@ gn@@ ment with what the real guy has ."
We have these ma@@ qu@@ et@@ tes sc@@ an@@ ned into the computer at very high re@@ solution — en@@ or@@ m@@ ous po@@ ly@@ g@@ onal coun@@ t .
And so now we had three age incre@@ ments of B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in in the computer .
But we needed to get a d@@ at@@ ab@@ ase of him doing more than that .
"We went through this process , then , called re@@ tar@@ ge@@ ting ."
This is Bra@@ d doing one of the E@@ k@@ man F@@ A@@ C@@ S pos@@ es .
"And here &apos;s the resul@@ ting data that comes from that , the model that comes from that ."
R@@ et@@ ar@@ ge@@ ting is the process of tran@@ spos@@ ing that data on@@ to another model .
"And because the life c@@ ast , or the b@@ ust — the ma@@ qu@@ et@@ te — of B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in was made from Bra@@ d , we could tran@@ spos@@ e the data of Bra@@ d at 4@@ 4 on@@ to Bra@@ d at 8@@ 7 ."
"So now , we had a 3@@ D d@@ at@@ ab@@ ase of everything Bra@@ d P@@ it@@ t &apos;s face can do at age 8@@ 7 , in his 7@@ 0s and in his 6@@ 0s ."
N@@ ex@@ t we had to go into the sho@@ ot@@ ing process .
"So while all that &apos;s going on , we &apos;re down in New O@@ r@@ le@@ ans and lo@@ c@@ ations around the world ."
"And we sh@@ ot our body ac@@ t@@ ors , and we sh@@ ot them we@@ aring blue ho@@ ods ."
So these are the g@@ ent@@ le@@ man who pla@@ yed B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in .
"And the blue ho@@ ods hel@@ ped us with two things : one , we could e@@ a@@ si@@ ly er@@ ase their he@@ ads ; and we also put trac@@ king mark@@ ers on their he@@ ads so we could re@@ create the cam@@ era moti@@ on and the len@@ s op@@ ti@@ cs from the set ."
But now we needed to get Bra@@ d &apos;s perform@@ ance to dri@@ ve our vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in .
And so we e@@ di@@ ted the fo@@ ot@@ age that was sh@@ ot on lo@@ cation with the rest of the c@@ ast and the body ac@@ t@@ ors and about six months later we brought Bra@@ d on@@ to a sound st@@ age in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les and he wat@@ ched on the scre@@ en .
"H@@ is job , then , was to become B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in ."
And so we lo@@ op@@ ed the scen@@ es .
He wat@@ ched again and again .
We en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed him to impro@@ vi@@ se .
And he took B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in into interesting and un@@ usu@@ al places that we didn &apos;t think he was going to go .
We sh@@ ot him with four H@@ D cam@@ er@@ as so we &apos;d get mul@@ ti@@ ple vie@@ ws of him and then Davi@@ d would cho@@ ose the take of Bra@@ d being B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in that he thought best mat@@ ched the fo@@ ot@@ age with the rest of the c@@ ast .
F@@ ro@@ m there we went into a process called image an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s .
"And so here , you can see again , the cho@@ s@@ en take ."
"And you are seeing , now , that data being tran@@ spos@@ ed on to B@@ en 8@@ 7 ."
"And so , what &apos;s interesting about this is we used something called image an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s , which is taking ti@@ min@@ gs from different com@@ pon@@ ents of B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in &apos;s face ."
"And so we could cho@@ ose , say , his left e@@ ye@@ bro@@ w ."
"And the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are would tell us that , well , in fra@@ me 14 the left e@@ ye@@ bro@@ w begin@@ s to move from here to here , and it con@@ clu@@ des moving in fra@@ me 3@@ 2 ."
And so we could cho@@ ose num@@ bers of posi@@ tions on the face to pu@@ ll that data from .
"And then , the sa@@ u@@ ce I tal@@ ked about with our technology ste@@ w — that se@@ cre@@ t sa@@ u@@ ce was , effe@@ cti@@ vely , so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that allow@@ ed us to mat@@ ch the perform@@ ance fo@@ ot@@ age of Bra@@ d in live action with our d@@ at@@ ab@@ ase of aged B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in , the F@@ A@@ C@@ S sha@@ p@@ es that we had ."
"O@@ n a fra@@ me@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ fra@@ me basi@@ s , we could actually re@@ con@@ stru@@ ct a 3@@ D head that exactly mat@@ ched the perform@@ ance of Bra@@ d ."
So this was how the fini@@ shed sh@@ ot ap@@ pe@@ ared in the film .
And here you can see the body ac@@ tor .
"And then this is what we called the &quot; &quot; de@@ ad head , &quot; &quot; no re@@ fer@@ ence to J@@ er@@ ry G@@ ar@@ cia ."
And then here &apos;s the re@@ con@@ stru@@ cted perform@@ ance now with the ti@@ min@@ gs of the perform@@ ance .
"And then , again , the fin@@ al sh@@ ot ."
It was a long process .
"( Applause ) The next se@@ ction here , I &apos;m going to just b@@ last through this , because we could do a whole TE@@ D@@ T@@ al@@ k on the next se@@ ver@@ al sli@@ des ."
We had to create a li@@ gh@@ ting system .
"So really , a big part of our pro@@ cess@@ es was cre@@ ating a li@@ gh@@ ting environment for every single lo@@ cation that B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in had to ap@@ pe@@ ar so that we could put B@@ en &apos;s head into any scen@@ e and it would exactly mat@@ ch the li@@ gh@@ ting that &apos;s on the other ac@@ t@@ ors in the real world ."
We also had to create an ey@@ e system .
"We found the old ad@@ age , you know , &quot; The eyes are the win@@ do@@ w to the s@@ ou@@ l , &quot; absolu@@ tely true ."
So the key here was to keep everybody looking in B@@ en &apos;s eyes .
"And if you could feel the war@@ m@@ th , and feel the hum@@ ani@@ ty , and feel his in@@ t@@ ent coming through the eyes , then we would suc@@ ce@@ ed ."
So we had one person fo@@ c@@ used on the ey@@ e system for almost two full years .
We also had to create a m@@ outh system .
We worked from d@@ ent@@ al mo@@ l@@ ds of Bra@@ d .
We had to age the te@@ e@@ th over time .
We also had to create an arti@@ cu@@ lat@@ ing ton@@ gu@@ e that allow@@ ed him to en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate his words .
There was a whole system wri@@ t@@ ten in so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to arti@@ cul@@ ate the ton@@ gu@@ e .
We had one person de@@ v@@ ot@@ ed to the ton@@ gu@@ e for about n@@ ine months .
He was very popul@@ ar .
S@@ k@@ in disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ement : another big deal .
The sk@@ in had to be absolu@@ tely ac@@ cur@@ ate .
"He &apos;s also in an old age home , he &apos;s in a n@@ ur@@ sing home around other old people , so he had to look exactly the same as the others ."
"So , lots of work on sk@@ in de@@ form@@ ation , you can see in some of these c@@ ases it works , in some c@@ ases it looks bad ."
"This is a very , very , very early test in our process ."
"So , effe@@ cti@@ vely we created a di@@ gi@@ tal pu@@ p@@ pe@@ t that Bra@@ d P@@ it@@ t could oper@@ ate with his own face ."
There were no ani@@ mat@@ ors ne@@ cess@@ ary to come in and inter@@ pre@@ t behavi@@ or or en@@ h@@ ance his perform@@ ance .
"There was something that we en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed , though , that we en@@ ded up cal@@ ling &quot; &quot; the di@@ gi@@ tal B@@ ot@@ o@@ x effe@@ ct . &quot; &quot; So , as things went through this process , F@@ in@@ ch@@ er would always say , &quot; &quot; It s@@ and@@ b@@ la@@ sts the ed@@ ges off of the perform@@ ance . &quot; &quot; And thing our process and the technology couldn &apos;t do , is they couldn &apos;t understand in@@ t@@ ent , the in@@ t@@ ent of the ac@@ tor ."
So it se@@ es a smi@@ le as a smi@@ le .
"It doesn &apos;t re@@ cogni@@ ze an i@@ ro@@ nic smi@@ le , or a happy smi@@ le , or a f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated smi@@ le ."
So it did take hum@@ ans to kind of p@@ us@@ h it one way or another .
"But we en@@ ded up cal@@ ling the entire process and all the technology &quot; &quot; emoti@@ on cap@@ ture , &quot; &quot; as op@@ posed to just moti@@ on cap@@ ture ."
T@@ ake another look .
"B@@ ra@@ d P@@ it@@ t : Well , I heard mom@@ ma and Ti@@ z@@ zy whi@@ sp@@ er , and they said I was g@@ on@@ na die so@@ on , but ... maybe not ."
E@@ U : That &apos;s how to create a di@@ gi@@ tal human in 18 minutes .

Thank you so much . It &apos;s really sc@@ ary to be here am@@ ong the s@@ mar@@ test of the s@@ mar@@ t .
I &apos;m here to tell you a few tal@@ es of pas@@ sion .
There &apos;s a Je@@ wi@@ sh saying that I love .
What is tru@@ er than tru@@ th ? An@@ s@@ wer : The story .
I &apos;m a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler . I want to con@@ v@@ ey something that is tru@@ er than tru@@ th about our common hum@@ ani@@ ty .
"A@@ ll stories inter@@ est me , and some ha@@ un@@ t me until I end up writing them ."
"C@@ er@@ tain the@@ mes keep coming up : ju@@ sti@@ ce , lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty , violence , death , poli@@ tical and social issu@@ es , fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"I &apos;m aw@@ are of the m@@ yst@@ ery around us , so I write about co@@ in@@ ci@@ den@@ ces , pre@@ mon@@ i@@ tions , emoti@@ ons , dre@@ am@@ s , the power of nature , mag@@ ic ."
"In the last 20 years I have publi@@ shed a few boo@@ ks , but I have li@@ ved in an@@ on@@ y@@ mi@@ ty until F@@ e@@ bru@@ ary of 200@@ 6 , when I car@@ ried the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c f@@ la@@ g in the W@@ in@@ ter O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ cs in I@@ tal@@ y ."
"That made me a ce@@ le@@ bri@@ ty . Now people re@@ cogni@@ ze me in M@@ acy &apos;s , and my grand@@ children think that I &apos;m cool ."
( Laughter ) Al@@ low me to tell you about my four minutes of fam@@ e .
"One of the organiz@@ ers of the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c cer@@ em@@ ony , of the open@@ ing cer@@ em@@ ony , called me and said that I had been se@@ le@@ cted to be one of the fl@@ ag@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ers ."
I re@@ pl@@ ied that su@@ re@@ ly this was a case of mist@@ ak@@ en iden@@ ti@@ ty because I &apos;m as far as you can get from being an a@@ th@@ le@@ te .
"A@@ c@@ tually , I wasn &apos;t even sure that I could go around the st@@ ad@@ i@@ um without a wal@@ k@@ er ."
( Laughter ) I was told that this was no l@@ augh@@ ing matter .
This would be the first time that only women would car@@ ry the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c f@@ la@@ g .
"F@@ i@@ ve women , re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing five contin@@ ents , and three O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c g@@ old me@@ d@@ al win@@ n@@ ers ."
"My first question was , natur@@ ally , what was I going to we@@ ar ?"
"( Laughter ) A uni@@ form , she said , and asked for my meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments ."
My meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments .
"I had a vision of myself in a flu@@ f@@ fy an@@ or@@ ak , looking like the Mi@@ che@@ li@@ n M@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) B@@ y the mi@@ ddle of F@@ e@@ bru@@ ary , I found myself in T@@ ur@@ in , where en@@ th@@ usi@@ a@@ stic c@@ row@@ ds che@@ er@@ ed when any of the 80 O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c te@@ am@@ s was in the stre@@ et ."
Th@@ ose a@@ th@@ le@@ tes had s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ced everything to compe@@ te in the g@@ am@@ es .
"They all des@@ er@@ ved to wi@@ n , but there &apos;s the ele@@ ment of lu@@ ck ."
"A spe@@ ck of s@@ now , an in@@ ch of ice , the force of the wind , can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine the resul@@ t of a rac@@ e or a g@@ ame ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , what mat@@ ters most — more than tra@@ ining or lu@@ ck — is the heart ."
O@@ n@@ ly a fe@@ ar@@ less and de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed heart will get the g@@ old me@@ d@@ al .
It is all about pas@@ sion .
The stre@@ ets of T@@ ur@@ in were co@@ vered with red post@@ ers an@@ n@@ oun@@ cing the s@@ log@@ an of the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ cs .
P@@ as@@ sion lives here . I@@ sn &apos;t it always true ?
H@@ ear@@ t is what dri@@ ves us and de@@ ter@@ min@@ es our f@@ ate .
That is what I need for my char@@ ac@@ ters in my boo@@ ks : a pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate heart .
"I need ma@@ ver@@ i@@ cks , dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents , ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ers , out@@ si@@ ders and re@@ be@@ ls , who ask questions , b@@ end the ru@@ les and take ri@@ sk@@ s ."
Pe@@ ople like all of you in this room .
N@@ ice people with common sense do not make interesting char@@ ac@@ ters .
( Laughter ) They only make good form@@ er spo@@ uses . ( Laughter )
"( Applause ) In the green room of the st@@ ad@@ i@@ um , I met the other f@@ la@@ g be@@ ar@@ ers : three a@@ th@@ le@@ tes , and the ac@@ tre@@ s@@ ses S@@ us@@ an S@@ ar@@ an@@ don and S@@ op@@ hi@@ a L@@ ore@@ n ."
"A@@ l@@ so , two women with pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate hear@@ ts : W@@ ang@@ ar@@ i Ma@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ i , the N@@ obe@@ l pri@@ ze@@ win@@ ner from Ken@@ ya who has plan@@ ted 30 million tre@@ es . And by doing so , she has changed the so@@ il , the we@@ a@@ ther , in some places in Africa , and of course the economic con@@ di@@ tions in many vi@@ ll@@ ages ."
"And S@@ om@@ al@@ y Mam , a C@@ am@@ bod@@ i@@ an acti@@ vi@@ st who fi@@ ghts pas@@ si@@ on@@ ately against child pro@@ stitu@@ tion ."
"When she was 14 years old , her grand@@ father s@@ old her to a bro@@ the@@ l ."
She told us of little girls ra@@ ped by men who believe that having se@@ x with a very young vi@@ r@@ g@@ in will cu@@ re them from AIDS .
"And of bro@@ the@@ ls where children are for@@ ced to re@@ cei@@ ve five , 15 cl@@ ien@@ ts per day , and if they re@@ be@@ l , they are tor@@ tu@@ red with electri@@ city ."
In the green room I re@@ cei@@ ved my uni@@ form .
"It was not the kind of out@@ f@@ it that I nor@@ m@@ ally we@@ ar , but it was far from the Mi@@ che@@ li@@ n M@@ an su@@ it that I had anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed . N@@ ot bad , really ."
I looked like a ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ ator .
"( Laughter ) But so did most of the fl@@ ag@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ers , ex@@ cept S@@ op@@ hi@@ a L@@ ore@@ n , the uni@@ vers@@ al sym@@ bo@@ l of beau@@ ty and pas@@ sion ."
S@@ op@@ hi@@ a is over 70 and she looks great .
"S@@ he &apos;s se@@ x@@ y , sli@@ m and t@@ all , with a de@@ ep t@@ an ."
"Now , how can you have a de@@ ep t@@ an and have no w@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ les ?"
I don &apos;t know .
"When asked in a T@@ V inter@@ view , &quot; &quot; How could she look so good ? &quot; &quot; She re@@ pl@@ ied , &quot; &quot; P@@ ost@@ ure . My back is always stra@@ ight , and I don &apos;t make old people &apos;s no@@ is@@ es . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , there you have some f@@ ree ad@@ vice from one of the most beautiful women on ear@@ th ."
"No gru@@ n@@ ting , no cou@@ gh@@ ing , no whe@@ e@@ z@@ ing , no talking to your@@ selves , no far@@ ting ."
"( Laughter ) Well , she didn &apos;t say that exactly . ( Laughter )"
"A@@ t some point around mi@@ dni@@ ght , we were sum@@ mon@@ ed to the w@@ ings of the st@@ ad@@ i@@ um , and the l@@ ou@@ d@@ spe@@ ak@@ ers an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c f@@ la@@ g , and the music started — by the way , the same music that star@@ ts here , the A@@ i@@ da Mar@@ ch ."
"S@@ op@@ hi@@ a L@@ ore@@ n was right in front of me — she &apos;s a fo@@ ot tal@@ ler than I am , not coun@@ ting the po@@ of@@ y ha@@ ir ."
"( Laughter ) She wal@@ ked ele@@ g@@ an@@ tly , like a gi@@ ra@@ f@@ fe on the Afri@@ can sa@@ v@@ an@@ na@@ h , hol@@ ding the f@@ la@@ g on her sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der . I j@@ og@@ g@@ ed behind ( Laughter ) — on my ti@@ p@@ to@@ es — hol@@ ding the f@@ la@@ g on my ex@@ ten@@ ded ar@@ m , so that my head was actually under the dam@@ n f@@ la@@ g . ( Laughter )"
"A@@ ll the cam@@ er@@ as were , of course , on S@@ op@@ hi@@ a ."
"That was for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate for me , because in most pre@@ ss ph@@ ot@@ os I ap@@ pe@@ ar too , al@@ though often between S@@ op@@ hi@@ a &apos;s le@@ gs ."
( Laughter ) A place where most men would love to be . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) The best four minutes of my entire life were those in the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c st@@ ad@@ i@@ um .
My h@@ us@@ b@@ and is of@@ f@@ en@@ ded when I say this — al@@ though I have expla@@ ined to him that what we do in pri@@ v@@ ate usu@@ ally takes less than four minutes — ( Laughter ) — so he sh@@ ouldn &apos;t take it per@@ son@@ ally .
"I have all the pre@@ ss cli@@ pp@@ ings of those four mag@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent minutes , because I don &apos;t want to for@@ get them when old age de@@ stro@@ ys my brain cells ."
I want to car@@ ry in my heart fore@@ ver the key word of the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ cs — pas@@ sion .
So here &apos;s a t@@ ale of pas@@ sion .
"The year is 199@@ 8 , the place is a pri@@ son cam@@ p for T@@ ut@@ si re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es in Con@@ go ."
"B@@ y the way , 80 percent of all re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es and disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed people in the world are women and girls ."
"We can call this place in Con@@ go a death cam@@ p , because those who are not kil@@ led will die of dise@@ ase or star@@ vation ."
"The pro@@ t@@ ag@@ on@@ ist@@ s of this story are a young woman , R@@ ose M@@ ap@@ en@@ do , and her children ."
She &apos;s pre@@ gn@@ ant and a wido@@ w .
S@@ ol@@ d@@ ier@@ s have for@@ ced her to wat@@ ch as her h@@ us@@ b@@ and was tor@@ tu@@ red and kil@@ led .
"S@@ ome@@ how she man@@ ages to keep her seven children ali@@ ve , and a few months later , she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to pre@@ mat@@ ure tw@@ ins ."
T@@ wo t@@ iny little bo@@ ys .
"S@@ he cu@@ ts the um@@ bi@@ li@@ cal cor@@ d with a sti@@ ck , and ties it with her own ha@@ ir ."
"S@@ he na@@ mes the tw@@ ins after the cam@@ p &apos;s comm@@ and@@ ers to ga@@ in their fa@@ v@@ or , and fe@@ eds them with black te@@ a because her mi@@ l@@ k cannot susta@@ in them ."
"When the sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s bur@@ st in her cell to ra@@ pe her ol@@ d@@ est d@@ aughter , she gra@@ b@@ s h@@ old of her and ref@@ uses to let go , even when they h@@ old a gu@@ n to her head ."
"S@@ ome@@ how , the family survi@@ ves for 16 months , and then , by ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary lu@@ ck , and the pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate heart of a young American man , S@@ ash@@ a Ch@@ an@@ off , who man@@ ages to put her in a U.@@ S. re@@ s@@ cu@@ e pl@@ ane , R@@ ose M@@ ap@@ en@@ do and her n@@ ine children end up in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x , A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona , where they &apos;re now living and th@@ ri@@ ving ."
"M@@ ap@@ en@@ do , in S@@ wa@@ hi@@ li , means great love ."
The pro@@ t@@ ag@@ on@@ ist@@ s of my boo@@ ks are stron@@ g and pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate women like R@@ ose M@@ ap@@ en@@ do .
I don &apos;t make them up . There &apos;s no need for that .
I look around and I see them every@@ where .
I have worked with women and for women all my life .
I know them well .
"I was born in an@@ cient times , at the end of the world , in a pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch@@ al C@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c and con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative family ."
"No won@@ der that by age five I was a ra@@ g@@ ing fe@@ min@@ i@@ st — al@@ though the ter@@ m had not re@@ ach@@ ed Chi@@ le yet , so no@@ body knew what the he@@ ck was wrong with me ."
"( Laughter ) I would so@@ on find out that there was a high pri@@ ce to pay for my fre@@ e@@ dom , and for questi@@ on@@ ing the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ chy ."
"But I was happy to pay it , because for every b@@ low that I re@@ cei@@ ved , I was able to deli@@ ver two ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ n@@ ce , when my d@@ aughter P@@ au@@ la was in her tw@@ ent@@ ies , she said to me that fe@@ min@@ is@@ m was d@@ ated , that I should move on ."
We had a memor@@ able fi@@ ght . F@@ em@@ in@@ is@@ m is d@@ ated ?
"@@ Yes , for pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed women like my d@@ aughter and all of us here today , but not for most of our si@@ st@@ ers in the rest of the world who are still for@@ ced into pre@@ mat@@ ure mar@@ ri@@ age , pro@@ stitu@@ tion , for@@ ced lab@@ or — they have children that they don &apos;t want or they cannot fe@@ ed ."
They have no control over their bod@@ ies or their lives .
They have no education and no fre@@ e@@ dom .
"They are ra@@ ped , be@@ at@@ en up and sometimes kil@@ led with im@@ pu@@ ni@@ ty ."
"For most W@@ est@@ er@@ n young women of today , being called a fe@@ min@@ i@@ st is an in@@ sul@@ t ."
"F@@ em@@ in@@ is@@ m has never been se@@ x@@ y , but let me as@@ sure you that it never stop@@ ped me from fli@@ r@@ ting , and I have sel@@ dom su@@ f@@ fer@@ ed from l@@ ack of men ."
"( Laughter ) F@@ em@@ in@@ is@@ m is not de@@ ad , by no means ."
"It has ev@@ olved . If you don &apos;t like the ter@@ m , change it , for G@@ od@@ d@@ ess &apos; s@@ ake ."
"C@@ all it A@@ ph@@ ro@@ di@@ te , or V@@ en@@ us , or bi@@ m@@ bo , or whatever you want ; the name doesn &apos;t matter , as long as we understand what it is about , and we sup@@ port it ."
"So here &apos;s another t@@ ale of pas@@ sion , and this is a sa@@ d one ."
The place is a small women &apos;s c@@ lin@@ ic in a vi@@ ll@@ age in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h .
The year is 200@@ 5 .
J@@ en@@ ny is a young American d@@ ent@@ al hy@@ g@@ ie@@ ni@@ st who has gone to the c@@ lin@@ ic as a vol@@ un@@ te@@ er during her thre@@ e-@@ week vac@@ ation .
"S@@ he &apos;s pre@@ par@@ ed to cle@@ an te@@ e@@ th , but when she gets there , she fin@@ ds out that there are no do@@ ct@@ ors , no den@@ ti@@ sts , and the c@@ lin@@ ic is just a hu@@ t full of fl@@ ies ."
"O@@ ut@@ side , there is a line of women who have wai@@ ted se@@ ver@@ al hours to be tre@@ ated ."
The first patien@@ t is in ex@@ c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating pa@@ in because she has se@@ ver@@ al ro@@ t@@ ten mo@@ lars .
J@@ en@@ ny realiz@@ es that the only solution is to pu@@ ll out the bad te@@ e@@ th .
She &apos;s not li@@ cen@@ sed for that ; she has never done it .
She ri@@ sk@@ s a lot and she &apos;s terri@@ f@@ ied .
"S@@ he doesn &apos;t even have the pro@@ per instru@@ ments , but for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely she has brought some N@@ o@@ vo@@ ca@@ ine ."
J@@ en@@ ny has a bra@@ ve and pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate heart .
She mu@@ r@@ mu@@ r@@ s a pra@@ y@@ er and she goes a@@ head with the oper@@ ation .
"A@@ t the end , the re@@ lie@@ ved patien@@ t k@@ is@@ ses her h@@ ands ."
That day the hy@@ g@@ ie@@ ni@@ st pul@@ ls out many more te@@ e@@ th .
"The next morning , when she comes again to the so@@ -@@ called c@@ lin@@ ic , her first patien@@ t is wai@@ ting for her with her h@@ us@@ b@@ and ."
The woman &apos;s face looks like a wat@@ er@@ me@@ l@@ on .
It is so s@@ wol@@ le@@ n that you can &apos;t even see the eyes .
"The h@@ us@@ b@@ and , fu@@ ri@@ ous , thre@@ at@@ ens to ki@@ ll the American ."
"J@@ en@@ ny is hor@@ ri@@ f@@ ied at what she has done , but then the trans@@ lat@@ or expla@@ ins that the patien@@ t &apos;s con@@ di@@ tion has nothing to do with the oper@@ ation ."
"The day before , her h@@ us@@ b@@ and be@@ at her up because she was not home in time to pre@@ p@@ are din@@ ner for him ."
M@@ il@@ li@@ ons of women live like this today .
They are the po@@ ore@@ st of the po@@ or .
"A@@ l@@ though women do two@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ ds of the world &apos;s lab@@ or , they own less than one percent of the world &apos;s as@@ se@@ ts ."
"They are pa@@ id less than men for the same work if they &apos;re pa@@ id at all , and they re@@ ma@@ in v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able because they have no economic in@@ depen@@ dence , and they are con@@ stan@@ tly thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by ex@@ plo@@ it@@ ation , violence and ab@@ use ."
"It is a fact that gi@@ ving women education , work , the ability to control their own in@@ come , in@@ her@@ it and own pro@@ per@@ ty , b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts the society ."
"If a woman is em@@ power@@ ed , her children and her family will be better off ."
"If fam@@ il@@ ies pro@@ sp@@ er , the vi@@ ll@@ age pro@@ sp@@ ers , and ev@@ en@@ tually so does the whole country ."
W@@ ang@@ ar@@ i Ma@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ i goes to a vi@@ ll@@ age in Ken@@ ya .
She tal@@ ks with the women and expla@@ ins that the land is bar@@ re@@ n because they have cut and s@@ old the tre@@ es .
"S@@ he gets the women to pl@@ ant new tre@@ es and water them , dro@@ p by dro@@ p ."
"In a matter of five or six years , they have a fore@@ st , the so@@ il is en@@ ri@@ ched , and the vi@@ ll@@ age is sa@@ ved ."
The po@@ ore@@ st and most back@@ ward socie@@ ties are always those that put women down .
Y@@ et this obvi@@ ous tru@@ th is ig@@ no@@ red by govern@@ ments and also by ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ropy .
"For every dol@@ lar given to a women &apos;s program , 20 dollars are given to men &apos;s progra@@ ms ."
W@@ om@@ en are 5@@ 1 percent of hum@@ an@@ kind .
E@@ m@@ power@@ ing them will change everything — more than technology and design and en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment .
"I can pro@@ mi@@ se you that women working together — lin@@ ked , inform@@ ed and edu@@ c@@ ated — can bring pe@@ ace and pro@@ sp@@ eri@@ ty to this for@@ s@@ ak@@ en planet ."
"In any war today , most of the c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ties are ci@@ vi@@ li@@ ans , ma@@ in@@ ly women and children . They are col@@ lat@@ er@@ al dam@@ age ."
"M@@ en run the world , and look at the m@@ ess we have ."
What kind of world do we want ?
This is a fundam@@ ent@@ al question that most of us are as@@ king .
D@@ o@@ es it make sense to parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in the ex@@ ist@@ ing world order ?
"We want a world where life is pre@@ ser@@ ved and the qu@@ ality of life is en@@ ri@@ ched for everybody , not only for the pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed ."
In J@@ an@@ u@@ ary I saw an ex@@ hi@@ bit of F@@ er@@ n@@ an@@ do B@@ ot@@ er@@ o &apos;s pain@@ t@@ ings at the U@@ C B@@ er@@ k@@ ele@@ y li@@ br@@ ary .
"No mus@@ e@@ um or gal@@ l@@ ery in the United States , ex@@ cept for the New York gal@@ l@@ ery that car@@ r@@ ies B@@ ot@@ er@@ o &apos;s work , has dar@@ ed to show the pain@@ t@@ ings because the the@@ me is the A@@ b@@ u G@@ h@@ ra@@ i@@ b pri@@ son ."
"They are huge pain@@ t@@ ings of tor@@ ture and ab@@ use of power , in the vol@@ um@@ in@@ ous B@@ ot@@ er@@ o sty@@ le ."
I have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart .
What I fe@@ ar most is power with im@@ pu@@ ni@@ ty .
"I fe@@ ar ab@@ use of power , and the power to ab@@ use ."
"In our species , the al@@ ph@@ a mal@@ es def@@ ine re@@ ality , and force the rest of the p@@ ack to ac@@ cept that re@@ ality and fol@@ low the ru@@ les ."
"The ru@@ les change all the time , but they always b@@ en@@ ef@@ it them , and in this case , the tri@@ ck@@ le@@ -@@ down effe@@ ct , which does not work in econ@@ omi@@ cs , works perfe@@ ct@@ ly ."
A@@ b@@ use tri@@ ck@@ les down from the top of the l@@ ad@@ der to the bot@@ tom .
"W@@ om@@ en and children , es@@ pe@@ cially the po@@ or , are at the bot@@ tom ."
E@@ ven the most de@@ stitu@@ te of men have someone they can ab@@ use — a woman or a child .
"I &apos;m f@@ ed up with the power that a few ex@@ er@@ t over the many through gen@@ der , in@@ come , rac@@ e , and clas@@ s ."
I think that the time is ri@@ pe to make fundam@@ ent@@ al chang@@ es in our ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation .
"But for real change , we need fe@@ min@@ ine energy in the man@@ ag@@ ement of the world ."
"We need a cri@@ tical number of women in posi@@ tions of power , and we need to n@@ ur@@ ture the fe@@ min@@ ine energy in men ."
"I &apos;m talking about men with young min@@ ds , of course ."
O@@ ld guys are hop@@ el@@ ess ; we have to wa@@ it for them to die off .
"( Laughter ) Yes , I would love to have S@@ op@@ hi@@ a L@@ ore@@ n &apos;s long le@@ gs and le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary bre@@ ast@@ s ."
"But given a cho@@ ice , I would rather have the war@@ ri@@ or hear@@ ts of W@@ ang@@ ar@@ i Ma@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ i , S@@ om@@ al@@ y Mam , J@@ en@@ ny and R@@ ose M@@ ap@@ en@@ do ."
I want to make this world good .
"N@@ ot better , but to make it good ."
"Wh@@ y not ? It is possible . L@@ ook around in this room — all this know@@ le@@ dge , energy , tal@@ ent and technology ."
"L@@ et &apos;s get off our fan@@ nie@@ s , ro@@ ll up our sle@@ ev@@ es and get to work , pas@@ si@@ on@@ ately , in cre@@ ating an almost perfe@@ ct world ."
Thank you .
What was the most difficult job you ever did ?
W@@ as it working to provi@@ de food for a family or a community ?
C@@ or@@ al re@@ ef@@ s are farm@@ ers .
And cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s are arti@@ sts .
And this beau@@ ty is the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of the tou@@ ri@@ sm indu@@ stry in many countries with few or little other natural re@@ sources .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
"They can sense color and light , te@@ x@@ tu@@ res , chemi@@ cal@@ s , p@@ H ."
"One cor@@ al po@@ ly@@ p will di@@ vi@@ de itself again and again and again , lea@@ ving a li@@ me@@ st@@ one sk@@ ele@@ ton under@@ ne@@ ath itself and grow@@ ing up tow@@ ard the su@@ n ."
And we have the t@@ in@@ ie@@ st reason to be op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic .
I &apos;m going to show you three exam@@ ples of the work we &apos;ve done to try to answer those questions .
I &apos;ve been trying to help cor@@ als become parents for over 10 years now .
And we almost took out an entire gener@@ ation of cor@@ als .
"G@@ row@@ ing up , I didn &apos;t always understand why my parents made me fol@@ low the ru@@ les that they did ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , why did I really have to mo@@ w the l@@ aw@@ n ?"
Why was h@@ ome@@ work really that important ?
Why couldn &apos;t I put je@@ lly be@@ ans in my o@@ at@@ me@@ al ?
My chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od was ab@@ ound with questions like this .
"N@@ or@@ mal things about being a kid and realiz@@ ing that sometimes , it was best to list@@ en to my parents even when I didn &apos;t exactly understand why ."
And it &apos;s not that they didn &apos;t want me to think cri@@ ti@@ cally .
"Th@@ e@@ ir par@@ ent@@ ing always s@@ ou@@ ght to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le the ten@@ sion between having my si@@ b@@ lin@@ gs and I understand the reali@@ ties of the world , while en@@ sur@@ ing that we never ac@@ cep@@ ted the stat@@ us qu@@ o as in@@ evi@@ table ."
"I came to realize that this , in and of itself , was a very pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful form of education ."
"One of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te edu@@ cat@@ ors , B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ an au@@ th@@ or and sch@@ ol@@ ar P@@ au@@ l@@ o F@@ re@@ i@@ re , spe@@ ak@@ s quite ex@@ pli@@ ci@@ tly about the need for education to be used as a to@@ ol for cri@@ tical a@@ wa@@ k@@ ening and sh@@ ared hum@@ ani@@ ty ."
"In his most fam@@ ous book , &quot; &quot; P@@ ed@@ a@@ go@@ gy of the O@@ p@@ pres@@ sed , &quot; &quot; he st@@ ates , &quot; &quot; No one can be au@@ th@@ enti@@ cally human while he pre@@ v@@ ents others from being so . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been thinking a lot about this lat@@ ely , this idea of hum@@ ani@@ ty , and speci@@ fi@@ cally , who in this world is af@@ for@@ ded the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of being per@@ cei@@ ved as fully human ."
"These ev@@ ents and all that has tran@@ spi@@ red after them have brought me back to my own chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od and the deci@@ sions that my parents made about ra@@ is@@ ing a black bo@@ y in America that grow@@ ing up , I didn &apos;t always understand in the way that I do now ."
"I think of how hard it must have been , how prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly un@@ fa@@ ir it must have felt for them to feel like they had to stri@@ p away par@@ ts of my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od just so that I could come home at night ."
"For example , I think of how one night , when I was around 12 years old , on an over@@ night fie@@ ld tri@@ p to another city , my friends and I b@@ ou@@ ght Su@@ per S@@ o@@ ak@@ ers and turned the hot@@ el par@@ king lot into our own wat@@ er@@ -@@ fil@@ led bat@@ tle z@@ one ."
"We hi@@ d behind cars , ru@@ n@@ ning through the dar@@ k@@ ness that l@@ ay between the stre@@ et@@ li@@ ghts , b@@ oun@@ d@@ less l@@ aughter u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous across the pa@@ v@@ ement ."
"But within 10 minutes , my father came outside , gra@@ b@@ bed me by my fore@@ ar@@ m and led me into our room with an un@@ fami@@ li@@ ar g@@ ri@@ p ."
"Be@@ fore I could say anything , tell him how fo@@ o@@ li@@ sh he had made me look in front of my friends , he der@@ i@@ ded me for being so na@@ i@@ ve ."
"L@@ o@@ o@@ ked me in the ey@@ e , fe@@ ar con@@ sum@@ ing his face , and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ on , I &apos;m sor@@ ry , but you can &apos;t act the same as your white friends ."
You can &apos;t pre@@ ten@@ d to sho@@ ot g@@ un@@ s .
You can &apos;t run around in the dar@@ k .
"You can &apos;t hi@@ de behind anything other than your own te@@ e@@ th . &quot; &quot; I know now how sc@@ ared he must have been , how e@@ a@@ si@@ ly I could have fal@@ le@@ n into the em@@ p@@ ty of the night , that some man would mist@@ ake this water for a good reason to wa@@ sh all of this away ."
"These are the sor@@ ts of mess@@ ages I &apos;ve been in@@ un@@ d@@ ated with my entire life : Al@@ ways keep your h@@ ands where they can see them , don &apos;t move too quickly , take off your ho@@ od when the su@@ n goes down ."
"My parents ra@@ is@@ ed me and my si@@ b@@ lin@@ gs in an ar@@ mo@@ r of ad@@ vice , an ocean of al@@ ar@@ m be@@ l@@ ls so someone wouldn &apos;t ste@@ al the bre@@ ath from our lu@@ n@@ gs , so that they wouldn &apos;t make a memor@@ y of this sk@@ in ."
"So that we could be kids , not c@@ as@@ k@@ et or con@@ cre@@ te ."
And it &apos;s not because they thought it would make us better than any@@ one else it &apos;s simply because they wanted to keep us ali@@ ve .
"A@@ ll of my black friends were ra@@ is@@ ed with the same mess@@ age , the talk , given to us when we became old enough to be mist@@ ak@@ en for a na@@ il ready to be ha@@ m@@ mer@@ ed to the ground , when people made our me@@ lan@@ in syn@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous with something to be fe@@ ared ."
But what does it do to a child to gro@@ w up know@@ ing that you cannot simply be a child ?
"That the wh@@ im@@ s of ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cen@@ ce are too d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous for your bre@@ ath , that you cannot simply be cu@@ ri@@ ous , that you are not af@@ for@@ ded the lu@@ x@@ ury of making a mist@@ ake , that someone &apos;s im@@ p@@ lic@@ it bi@@ as might be the reason you don &apos;t wa@@ ke up in the morning ."
But this cannot be what de@@ fin@@ es us .
"Because we have parents who ra@@ is@@ ed us to understand that our bod@@ ies wer@@ en &apos;t me@@ ant for the back@@ side of a bu@@ l@@ let , but for fl@@ ying ki@@ tes and j@@ um@@ ping rop@@ e , and l@@ augh@@ ing until our st@@ om@@ ach@@ s bur@@ st ."
"So when we say that black lives matter , it &apos;s not because others don &apos;t , it &apos;s simply because we must af@@ fir@@ m that we are wor@@ th@@ y of ex@@ ist@@ ing without fe@@ ar , when so many things tell us we are not ."
"I want to live in a world where my son will not be pre@@ sum@@ ed gu@@ il@@ ty the moment he is born , where a to@@ y in his hand isn &apos;t mist@@ ak@@ en for anything other than a to@@ y ."
"And I ref@@ use to ac@@ cept that we can &apos;t build this world into something new , some place where a child &apos;s name doesn &apos;t have to be wri@@ t@@ ten on a t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t , or a tom@@ b@@ st@@ one , where the val@@ ue of someone &apos;s life isn &apos;t de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed by anything other than the fact that they had lu@@ n@@ gs , a place where every single one of us can bre@@ a@@ the ."

W@@ el@@ come to T@@ ha@@ il@@ and .
"Now , when I was a young man — 40 years ago , the country was very , very po@@ or with lots and lots and lots of people living in po@@ ver@@ ty ."
"We decided to do something about it , but we didn &apos;t beg@@ in with a wel@@ f@@ are program or a po@@ ver@@ ty redu@@ ction program ."
"But we began with a fam@@ il@@ y@@ -@@ plan@@ ning program , fol@@ low@@ ing a very suc@@ cess@@ ful mat@@ er@@ na@@ l child health acti@@ vity , se@@ ts of acti@@ vi@@ ties ."
"So basically , no one would ac@@ cept family plan@@ ning if their children didn &apos;t survi@@ ve ."
"So the first ste@@ p : get to the children , get to the mo@@ thers , and then fol@@ low up with family plan@@ ning ."
"N@@ ot just child mor@@ t@@ ality alone , you need also family plan@@ ning ."
Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it .
"In my country , that was the case in 19@@ 7@@ 4 ."
S@@ even children per family — tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous grow@@ th at 3@@ .@@ 3 percent .
There was just no future .
We needed to redu@@ ce the popul@@ ation grow@@ th r@@ ate .
"So we said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do it . &quot; &quot; The women said , &quot; &quot; We ag@@ ree . We &apos;ll use pi@@ l@@ ls , but we need a do@@ ctor to pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ be the pi@@ l@@ ls , &quot; &quot; and we had very , very few do@@ ct@@ ors ."
We didn &apos;t take no as an answer ; we took no as a question .
"We went to the n@@ ur@@ ses and the mi@@ d@@ wi@@ ves , who were also women , and did a fanta@@ stic job at expla@@ ining how to use the pi@@ ll ."
"That was wonderful , but it co@@ vered only 20 percent of the country ."
"What do we do for the other 80 percent — leave them alone and say , &quot; &quot; Well , they &apos;re not medi@@ cal per@@ son@@ ne@@ l . &quot; &quot; No , we decided to do a bit more ."
So we went to the ordin@@ ary people that you saw .
"A@@ c@@ tually , be@@ low that y@@ el@@ low sig@@ n — I wi@@ sh they ha@@ dn &apos;t wi@@ ped that , because there was &quot; &quot; Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a &quot; &quot; there ."
We were so much bi@@ g@@ ger than Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a in those days .
"And no difference , the people they cho@@ se were the people we cho@@ se ."
"They were wel@@ l-@@ known in the community , they knew that cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers were always right , and they were terri@@ fic , and they prac@@ ti@@ ced their family plan@@ ning themselves ."
"So they could su@@ pp@@ ly pi@@ l@@ ls and con@@ dom@@ s throu@@ gh@@ out the country , in every vi@@ ll@@ age of the country ."
So there we are . We went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution .
"Wh@@ er@@ ever there were people — and you can see bo@@ ats with the women , sel@@ ling things — here &apos;s the flo@@ ating market sel@@ ling ban@@ an@@ as and c@@ ra@@ b@@ s and also con@@ trac@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ ves — wh@@ er@@ ever you find people , you &apos;ll find con@@ trac@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ ves in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and ."
"And then we decided , why not get to religi@@ on because in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines , the C@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c Ch@@ ur@@ ch was pretty stron@@ g , and T@@ ha@@ i people were Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ st ."
"We went to them and they said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , could you help us ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m there — the one in blue , not the y@@ el@@ low — hol@@ ding a bow@@ l of ho@@ ly water for the mon@@ k to sp@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ le ho@@ ly water on pi@@ l@@ ls and con@@ dom@@ s for the s@@ an@@ cti@@ ty of the family ."
And this picture was s@@ ent throu@@ gh@@ out the country .
So some of the mon@@ ks in the vi@@ ll@@ ages were doing the same thing themselves .
"And the women were saying , &quot; &quot; No won@@ der we have no si@@ de@@ -@@ effe@@ cts ."
It &apos;s been bl@@ ess@@ ed . &quot; &quot; That was their per@@ cep@@ tion .
And then we went to teach@@ ers .
You need everybody to be inv@@ olved in trying to provi@@ de whatever it is that make hum@@ ani@@ ty a better place .
So we went to the teach@@ ers .
"O@@ ver a qu@@ ar@@ ter of a million were t@@ au@@ ght about family plan@@ ning with a new al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t — A , B for bir@@ th , C for con@@ dom , I for I@@ U@@ D , V for v@@ as@@ e@@ ct@@ om@@ y ."
"And then we had a s@@ na@@ k@@ es and l@@ ad@@ ders g@@ ame , where you th@@ row di@@ ce ."
"If you land on anything pro@@ -@@ family plan@@ ning , you move a@@ head ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , &quot; &quot; M@@ other takes the pi@@ ll every night ."
"@@ V@@ ery good , mother . Mo@@ ve a@@ head ."
"U@@ n@@ cle bu@@ ys a con@@ dom . V@@ ery good , un@@ cle . Mo@@ ve a@@ head ."
"U@@ n@@ cle gets dru@@ n@@ k , doesn &apos;t use con@@ dom . C@@ ome back , start again . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A@@ ga@@ in , education , clas@@ s en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment ."
And the kids were doing it in school too .
"We had rel@@ ay rac@@ es with con@@ dom@@ s , we had children &apos;s con@@ dom@@ -@@ b@@ low@@ ing ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on@@ ship ."
"And before long , the con@@ dom was know as the girl &apos;s best friend ."
"In T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , for po@@ or people , di@@ am@@ on@@ ds don &apos;t make it — so the con@@ dom is the girl &apos;s best friend ."
"We in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced our first micro@@ cre@@ d@@ it program in 19@@ 7@@ 5 , and the women who organiz@@ ed it said , &quot; &quot; We only want to l@@ end to women who prac@@ ti@@ ce family plan@@ ning ."
"If you &apos;re pre@@ gn@@ ant , take care of your pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy ."
"If you &apos;re not pre@@ gn@@ ant , you can take a lo@@ an out from us . &quot; &quot; And that was run by them ."
"And after 3@@ 5 / 3@@ 6 years , it &apos;s still going on ."
"It &apos;s a part of the V@@ il@@ l@@ age D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ pment B@@ ank ; it &apos;s not a real b@@ ank , but it &apos;s a fu@@ nd — micro@@ cre@@ d@@ it ."
And we didn &apos;t need a big organiz@@ ation to run it — it was run by the vi@@ ll@@ ag@@ ers themselves .
"And you probably har@@ d@@ ly see a T@@ ha@@ i man there , it &apos;s always women , women , women , women ."
"And then we thought we &apos;d help America , because America &apos;s been hel@@ ping everyone , whether they want help or not ."
( Laughter ) And this is on the F@@ our@@ th of Ju@@ ly .
"We decided to provi@@ de v@@ as@@ e@@ ct@@ om@@ y to all men , but in particular , American men to the front of the qu@@ e@@ ue , right up to the Am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ or &apos;s resi@@ dence during his &#91; un@@ clear &#93; ."
And the hot@@ el gave us the bal@@ l@@ room for it — very appro@@ pri@@ ate room .
"( Laughter ) And since it was ne@@ ar lu@@ n@@ ch time , they said , &quot; &quot; All right , we &apos;ll give you some lu@@ n@@ ch ."
"O@@ f course , it must be American col@@ a ."
"You get two bran@@ ds , Co@@ ke and Pe@@ p@@ si ."
And then the food is either ha@@ m@@ bur@@ ger or hot@@ do@@ g . &quot; &quot; And I thought a hot@@ do@@ g will be more sym@@ bo@@ li@@ c .
"( Laughter ) And here is this , then , young man called W@@ il@@ ly Bo@@ h@@ m who worked for the U@@ S@@ A@@ I@@ D ."
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , he &apos;s had his v@@ as@@ e@@ ct@@ om@@ y because his hot@@ do@@ g is half e@@ at@@ en , and he was very happy ."
"It made a lot of news in America , and it ang@@ er@@ ed some people also ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry . C@@ ome over and I &apos;ll do the whole lot of you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And what happened ?"
"In all this thing , from seven children to 1@@ .@@ 5 children , popul@@ ation grow@@ th r@@ ate of 3@@ .@@ 3 to 0@@ .@@ 5 ."
You could call it the Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a appro@@ ach if you like — it was exactly the same thing .
"I &apos;m not sure whether Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a fol@@ low@@ ed us , or we fol@@ low@@ ed Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a , but we &apos;re good friends ."
And so that &apos;s the case of everyone jo@@ ining in .
We didn &apos;t have a stron@@ g government . We didn &apos;t have lots of do@@ ct@@ ors .
But it &apos;s everybody &apos;s job who can change at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de and behavi@@ or .
"Th@@ en AIDS came along and h@@ it T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fi@@ ght AIDS ."
"But un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , the government was in d@@ eni@@ al , d@@ eni@@ al , d@@ eni@@ al ."
So our work wasn &apos;t af@@ fe@@ cted .
"So I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , if you can &apos;t go to the government , go to the mi@@ lit@@ ary . &quot; &quot; So I went to the mi@@ lit@@ ary and asked to bor@@ row 3@@ 00 radi@@ o st@@ ations ."
"They have more than the government , and they &apos;ve got more g@@ un@@ s than the government ."
"So I asked them , could they help us in our fi@@ ght against HIV ."
"And after I gave them st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs , they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . O@@ kay . You can use all the radi@@ o st@@ ations , tele@@ vision st@@ ations . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s when we went on@@ to the air@@ wa@@ ves ."
And then we got a new pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er so@@ on after that .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ech@@ a@@ i , could you come and jo@@ in ? &quot; &quot; He asked me in because he li@@ ked my wi@@ fe a lot ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay . &quot; &quot; He became the cha@@ ir@@ man of the N@@ ational AIDS C@@ om@@ mi@@ t@@ te@@ e and incre@@ as@@ ed the bud@@ get fi@@ f@@ ty@@ -@@ f@@ old ."
"E@@ very min@@ ist@@ ry , even ju@@ d@@ ges , had to be inv@@ olved in AIDS education — everyone — and we said the public , institu@@ tions , religi@@ ous institu@@ tions , scho@@ ols — everyone was inv@@ olved ."
"And here , every media person had to be tra@@ ined for HIV ."
And we gave every st@@ ation half a minu@@ te ex@@ tra for ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing to ear@@ n more money .
So they were happy with that .
"And then AIDS education in all scho@@ ols , star@@ ting from uni@@ versity ."
And these are high school kids teach@@ ing high school kids .
"And the best teach@@ ers were the girls , not the bo@@ ys , and they were terri@@ fic ."
And these girls who go around teach@@ ing about sa@@ fe se@@ x and HIV were known as M@@ other Th@@ er@@ es@@ a .
And then we went down one more ste@@ p .
"These are pri@@ mar@@ y school kids — third , f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de — going to every hou@@ se@@ h@@ old in the vi@@ ll@@ age , every hou@@ se@@ h@@ old in the whole of T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , gi@@ ving AIDS information and a con@@ dom to every hou@@ se@@ h@@ old , given by these young kids ."
"And no parents obje@@ cted , because we were trying to sa@@ ve lives , and this was a li@@ f@@ es@@ a@@ ver ."
"And we said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ one needs to be inv@@ olved . &quot; &quot; So you have the comp@@ an@@ ies also realiz@@ ing that si@@ ck st@@ af@@ f don &apos;t work , and de@@ ad cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers don &apos;t bu@@ y ."
So they all tra@@ ined .
"And then we have this C@@ ap@@ tain Con@@ dom , with his H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard M@@ B@@ A , going to scho@@ ols and night spo@@ ts ."
And they lo@@ ved him . You need a sym@@ bo@@ l of something .
"In every country , every program , you need a sym@@ bo@@ l , and this is probably the best thing he &apos;s ever done with his M@@ B@@ A ."
"( Laughter ) And then we gave con@@ dom@@ s out every@@ where on the stre@@ ets — every@@ where , every@@ where ."
"In ta@@ x@@ is , you get con@@ dom@@ s ."
"And also , in traf@@ fic , the poli@@ c@@ em@@ en give you con@@ dom@@ s — our &quot; &quot; cop@@ s and ru@@ b@@ bers &quot; &quot; progra@@ ms ."
"( Laughter ) So , can you imagine New York poli@@ c@@ em@@ en gi@@ ving out con@@ dom@@ s ?"
"O@@ f course I can . And they &apos;d en@@ jo@@ y it im@@ men@@ se@@ ly ; I see them standing around right now , every@@ where ."
"I@@ mag@@ ine if they had con@@ dom@@ s , gi@@ ving out to all sor@@ ts of people ."
"And then , new change , we had ha@@ ir b@@ ands , clo@@ thing and the con@@ dom for your mo@@ bi@@ le phone during the ra@@ iny se@@ as@@ on ."
( Laughter ) And these were the con@@ dom@@ s that we in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced .
"One says , &quot; &quot; W@@ e@@ apo@@ n of mas@@ s prote@@ ction . &quot; &quot; We found — you know — somebody here was sear@@ ching for the we@@ apo@@ n of mas@@ s de@@ stru@@ ction , but we have found the we@@ apo@@ n of mas@@ s prote@@ ction : the con@@ dom ."
"And then it says here , with the American f@@ la@@ g , &quot; D@@ on &apos;t leave home without it . &quot;"
But I have some to give out af@@ ter@@ ward .
"But let me war@@ n you , these are T@@ ha@@ i@@ -@@ si@@ zed , so be very car@@ e@@ ful ."
( Laughter ) And so you can see that con@@ dom@@ s can do so many things .
L@@ ook at this — I gave this to A@@ l G@@ ore and to Bi@@ ll S@@ eni@@ or also .
S@@ top global war@@ ming ; use con@@ dom@@ s .
And then this is the picture I men@@ tion@@ ed to you — the we@@ apo@@ n of mas@@ s prote@@ ction .
And let the next O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ cs sa@@ ve some lives .
Why just run around ?
"( Laughter ) And then finally , in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and we &apos;re Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ st , we don &apos;t have a God , so instead , we say , &quot; &quot; In ru@@ b@@ ber we tr@@ ust . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So you can see that we ad@@ ded everything to our en@@ de@@ av@@ or to make life better for the people ."
"We had con@@ dom@@ s in all the ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ at@@ ors in the hot@@ els and the scho@@ ols , because al@@ co@@ ho@@ l im@@ pa@@ ir@@ s ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment ."
And then what happened ?
"A@@ f@@ ter all this time , everybody jo@@ ined in ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to the U.@@ N@@ . , new c@@ ases of HIV dec@@ lin@@ ed by 90 percent , and ac@@ cor@@ ding to the World B@@ ank , 7@@ .@@ 7 million lives were sa@@ ved ."
O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se there wouldn &apos;t be many T@@ ha@@ is wal@@ king around today .
"So it just show@@ ed you , you could do something about it ."
90 percent of the fun@@ ding came from T@@ ha@@ il@@ and .
"There was poli@@ tical com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment , some fin@@ an@@ cial com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment , and everybody jo@@ ined in the fi@@ ght ."
So just don &apos;t leave it to the speci@@ ali@@ sts and do@@ ct@@ ors and n@@ ur@@ ses .
We all need to help .
"And then we decided to help people out of po@@ ver@@ ty , now that we got AIDS some@@ what out of the way — this time , not with government alone , but in co@@ oper@@ ation with the business community ."
Because po@@ or people are business people who l@@ ack business sk@@ il@@ ls and ac@@ cess to cre@@ d@@ it .
Th@@ ose are the things to be provi@@ ded by the business community .
"We &apos;re trying to turn them into bar@@ e@@ fo@@ ot ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s , little business people ."
The only way out of po@@ ver@@ ty is through business en@@ ter@@ pri@@ se .
"So , that was done ."
The money goes from the company into the vi@@ ll@@ age vi@@ a tre@@ e-@@ plan@@ ting .
It &apos;s not a f@@ ree gi@@ ft .
"They pl@@ ant the tre@@ es , and the money goes into their micro@@ cre@@ d@@ it fu@@ nd , which we call the V@@ il@@ l@@ age D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ pment B@@ ank ."
"E@@ very@@ body jo@@ ins in , and they feel they own the b@@ ank , because they have brought the money in ."
"And before you can bor@@ row the money , you need to be tra@@ ined ."
"And we believe if you want to help the po@@ or , those who are living in po@@ ver@@ ty , ac@@ cess to cre@@ d@@ it must be a human right ."
A@@ c@@ cess to cre@@ d@@ it must be a human right .
O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se they &apos;ll never get out of po@@ ver@@ ty .
"And then before getting a lo@@ an , you must be tra@@ ined ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s what we call a &quot; &quot; bar@@ e@@ fo@@ ot M@@ B@@ A , &quot; &quot; teach@@ ing people how to do business so that , when they bor@@ row money , they &apos;ll suc@@ ce@@ ed with the business ."
"These are some of the bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es : mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms , c@@ ra@@ b@@ s , ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les , tre@@ es , f@@ ru@@ its , and this is very interesting — Ni@@ ke ice cre@@ am and Ni@@ ke bi@@ s@@ cu@@ its ; this is a vi@@ ll@@ age spon@@ so@@ red by Ni@@ ke ."
"They said , &quot; &quot; They should stop making sho@@ es and clo@@ the@@ s ."
"M@@ ake these better , because we can af@@ for@@ d them . &quot; &quot; And then we have sil@@ k , T@@ ha@@ i sil@@ k ."
"Now we &apos;re making S@@ c@@ ot@@ ti@@ sh tar@@ t@@ ans , as you can see on the left , to se@@ ll to all people of S@@ c@@ ot@@ ti@@ sh an@@ c@@ est@@ ors ."
"So any@@ one sitting in and wat@@ ching T@@ V , get in tou@@ ch with me ."
And then this is our answer to St@@ ar@@ bu@@ cks in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and — &quot; C@@ of@@ fe@@ e and Con@@ dom@@ s . &quot;
"S@@ e@@ e , St@@ ar@@ bu@@ cks you a@@ wa@@ ke , we keep you a@@ wa@@ ke and ali@@ ve ."
That &apos;s the difference .
"C@@ an you imagine , at every St@@ ar@@ bu@@ cks that you can also get con@@ dom@@ s ?"
You can order your con@@ dom@@ s with your with your cap@@ pu@@ c@@ cin@@ o .
"And then now , finally in education , we want to change the school as being under@@ u@@ ti@@ liz@@ ed into a place where it &apos;s a li@@ fel@@ ong lear@@ ning cen@@ ter for everyone ."
We call this our S@@ cho@@ ol@@ -@@ B@@ as@@ ed In@@ te@@ gr@@ ated R@@ u@@ ral D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ pment .
"And it &apos;s a cen@@ ter , a fo@@ cal point for economic and social develo@@ pment ."
"R@@ e-@@ do the school , make it ser@@ ve the community needs ."
And here is a b@@ am@@ bo@@ o building — all of them are b@@ am@@ bo@@ o .
This is a ge@@ o@@ de@@ si@@ c dom@@ e made of b@@ am@@ bo@@ o .
"And I &apos;m sure Bu@@ ck@@ min@@ ster F@@ ul@@ ler would be very , very pro@@ u@@ d to see a b@@ am@@ bo@@ o ge@@ o@@ de@@ si@@ c dom@@ e ."
"And we use ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les around the school ground , so they ra@@ ise their own ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les ."
"And then , finally , I fir@@ m@@ ly believe , if we want the M@@ D@@ G@@ s to work — the M@@ il@@ len@@ ni@@ um D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ pment Go@@ als — we need to ad@@ d family plan@@ ning to it ."
"O@@ f course , child mor@@ t@@ ality first and then family plan@@ ning — everyone needs family plan@@ ning ser@@ vice — it &apos;s under@@ u@@ ti@@ liz@@ ed ."
So we have now found the we@@ apo@@ n of mas@@ s prote@@ ction .
And we also ask the next O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ cs to be inv@@ olved in sa@@ ving lives .
"And then , finally , that is our network ."
And these are our T@@ ha@@ i tu@@ li@@ ps .
( Laughter ) Thank you very much in@@ de@@ ed .
( Applause )
I think J@@ as@@ on W@@ e@@ b@@ ley last night called it &quot; con@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing to be part of the mag@@ ic . &quot;
Ma@@ ybe something like this .
My se@@ du@@ ction into the world of fi@@ re@@ fl@@ ies began when I was back in gra@@ du@@ ate school .
And what happens after the li@@ ghts go out ?
all b@@ lin@@ king together in st@@ un@@ ning syn@@ chro@@ ny .
They &apos;re char@@ is@@ m@@ atic .
O@@ ther cre@@ at@@ ures can en@@ jo@@ y them too .
I think these g@@ rac@@ e@@ ful in@@ se@@ cts are tru@@ ly mi@@ rac@@ ul@@ ous because they so beauti@@ fully il@@ lu@@ min@@ ate the cre@@ ative impro@@ vi@@ s@@ ation of ev@@ olution .
"A@@ round 1@@ 50 million years ago , the very first fi@@ re@@ fl@@ ies probably looked like this ."
They f@@ le@@ w during the da@@ y@@ time and they didn &apos;t light up .
"In other fi@@ re@@ fl@@ ies , it &apos;s only the fe@@ mal@@ es who light up ."
"They are at@@ trac@@ ti@@ vely p@@ lu@@ m@@ p and win@@ gl@@ ess , so every night , they clim@@ b up on@@ to per@@ ch@@ es and they g@@ low bri@@ gh@@ tly for hours to at@@ trac@@ t their fl@@ ying but un@@ li@@ t mal@@ es ."
"In still other fi@@ re@@ fl@@ ies , both se@@ x@@ es use qui@@ ck , b@@ right f@@ las@@ h@@ es to find their mat@@ es ."
How do they do that ?
In@@ cre@@ di@@ ble .
"They spend the v@@ ast maj@@ ori@@ ty of their li@@ fe@@ time , up to two years , in this lar@@ v@@ al form ."
"E@@ very single fi@@ ref@@ ly lar@@ v@@ a can light up , even when their ad@@ ul@@ ts can &apos;t ."
They &apos;re fl@@ ying and f@@ las@@ h@@ ing their hear@@ ts out .
I still find it very ro@@ man@@ tic .
"But me@@ an@@ while , where are all the fe@@ mal@@ es ?"
"They have pl@@ en@@ ty of mal@@ es to cho@@ ose from , and these fe@@ mal@@ es turn out to be very pi@@ ck@@ y ."
It &apos;s her &quot; &quot; come hi@@ ther &quot; &quot; sig@@ n .
So he fl@@ ies clo@@ s@@ er and he f@@ las@@ h@@ es again .
So what exactly do these fe@@ mal@@ es consi@@ der se@@ x@@ y ?
We can actually see the gi@@ ft — it &apos;s sh@@ own here in red — as it &apos;s being pas@@ sed from the m@@ ale to the fe@@ m@@ ale .
What makes this gi@@ ft so val@@ u@@ able is that it &apos;s pac@@ ked with prote@@ in that the fe@@ m@@ ale will use to pro@@ vision her e@@ g@@ gs .
So fe@@ mal@@ es are ke@@ e@@ ping their eyes on this pri@@ ze as they size up poten@@ tial mat@@ es .
So it &apos;s not all s@@ we@@ et@@ ness and light .
F@@ i@@ ref@@ ly ro@@ m@@ ance is ri@@ sk@@ y .
"F@@ ir@@ st the pre@@ y m@@ ale f@@ las@@ h@@ es , &quot; &quot; Do you love me ? &quot; &quot; H@@ is own fe@@ m@@ ale respon@@ ds , &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ybe . &quot; &quot; So then he f@@ las@@ h@@ es again ."
"But this time , the pre@@ d@@ ator s@@ ne@@ ak@@ s in a re@@ ply that cle@@ ver@@ ly mi@@ mi@@ cs exactly what the other fe@@ m@@ ale just said ."
She &apos;s not looking for love : she &apos;s looking for to@@ x@@ ins .
"U@@ na@@ ble to make their own to@@ x@@ ins , these fe@@ mal@@ es re@@ sort to d@@ r@@ in@@ king the blo@@ od of other fi@@ re@@ fl@@ ies to get these prote@@ ctive chemi@@ cal@@ s ."
"So a fi@@ ref@@ ly v@@ am@@ pi@@ re , brought to you by natural se@@ le@@ ction ."
The ma@@ in cul@@ pr@@ it : ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at lo@@ ss .
"P@@ re@@ t@@ ty much every@@ where , the fie@@ l@@ ds and fore@@ sts , the m@@ ang@@ ro@@ ves and me@@ ad@@ ow@@ s that fi@@ re@@ fl@@ ies need to survi@@ ve , are gi@@ ving way to develo@@ pment and to spraw@@ l ."
Do we really need fi@@ re@@ fl@@ ies ?
"As we work together to c@@ ra@@ ft a plan@@ et@@ ary future , I hope we can find a way to keep these b@@ right li@@ ghts sh@@ ining ."
Thank you .
"I want to share with you some ideas about the se@@ cre@@ t power of time , in a very shor@@ t time ."
"@@ V@@ ide@@ o : All right , start the clo@@ ck ple@@ ase . 30 secon@@ ds studi@@ o ."
K@@ e@@ ep it qu@@ ie@@ t ple@@ ase . S@@ et@@ tle down .
It &apos;s about time . E@@ nd sequ@@ ence . T@@ ake one .
15 secon@@ ds studi@@ o .
"@@ 10 , n@@ ine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two ..."
P@@ hi@@ li@@ p Z@@ im@@ bar@@ do : Let &apos;s tu@@ ne into the convers@@ ation of the prin@@ ci@@ p@@ als in A@@ d@@ am &apos;s tem@@ p@@ tation .
"&quot; C@@ ome on A@@ d@@ am , don &apos;t be so wi@@ sh@@ y@@ -@@ wa@@ sh@@ y . T@@ ake a bi@@ te . &quot; &quot; I did . &quot;"
"&quot; One bi@@ te , A@@ d@@ am . D@@ on &apos;t ab@@ an@@ don E@@ ve . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , guys ."
I don &apos;t want to get in t@@ rou@@ ble . &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ kay . One bi@@ te . What the he@@ ll ? &quot;
"( Laughter ) Li@@ fe is tem@@ p@@ tation . It &apos;s all about y@@ ie@@ l@@ ding , resi@@ st@@ ing , y@@ es , no , now , later , im@@ pul@@ sive , ref@@ le@@ ctive , present fo@@ cus and future fo@@ cus ."
Pro@@ mis@@ ed vi@@ r@@ tu@@ es f@@ all pre@@ y to the pas@@ sions of the moment .
"O@@ f te@@ en@@ age girls who ple@@ d@@ g@@ ed se@@ x@@ u@@ al ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence and vi@@ r@@ gin@@ ity until mar@@ ri@@ age — th@@ ank you G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h — the maj@@ ori@@ ty , 60 percent , y@@ ie@@ l@@ ded to se@@ x@@ u@@ al tem@@ p@@ t@@ ations within one year ."
And most of them did so without using bir@@ th control .
So much for pro@@ mis@@ es .
"Now le@@ ts tem@@ pt f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds , gi@@ ving them a tre@@ at ."
"They can have one mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low now . But if they wa@@ it until the experim@@ enter comes back , they can have two ."
"O@@ f course it pa@@ ys , if you like mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ s , to wa@@ it ."
What happens is two@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ ds of the kids give in to tem@@ p@@ tation .
"They cannot wa@@ it . The others , of course , wa@@ it ."
They resi@@ st the tem@@ p@@ tation . They de@@ l@@ ay the now for later .
"W@@ al@@ ter M@@ is@@ ch@@ el , my colle@@ ag@@ ue at St@@ an@@ for@@ d , went back 14 years later , to try to disco@@ ver what was different about those kids ."
"There were en@@ or@@ m@@ ous differ@@ ences between kids who resi@@ st@@ ed and kids who y@@ ie@@ l@@ ded , in many ways ."
The kids who resi@@ st@@ ed s@@ co@@ red 2@@ 50 poin@@ ts high@@ er on the S@@ A@@ T .
That &apos;s en@@ or@@ m@@ ous . That &apos;s like a whole set of different I@@ Q poin@@ ts .
They didn &apos;t get in as much t@@ rou@@ ble . They were better students .
"They were self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dent and de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed . And the key for me today , the key for you , is , they were fu@@ tu@@ re@@ -@@ fo@@ c@@ used rather than pres@@ ent@@ -@@ fo@@ c@@ used ."
So what is time perspe@@ ctive ? That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about today .
"T@@ i@@ me perspe@@ ctive is the study of how individu@@ als , all of us , di@@ vi@@ de the f@@ low of your human experience into time z@@ ones or time c@@ ate@@ gor@@ ies ."
And you do it au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally and n@@ on-@@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously .
"They v@@ ary between cul@@ tu@@ res , between n@@ ations , between individu@@ als , between social clas@@ ses , between education le@@ v@@ els ."
"And the problem is that they can become bi@@ as@@ ed , because you learn to over@@ -@@ use some of them and under@@ -@@ use the others ."
What de@@ ter@@ min@@ es any deci@@ sion you make ?
You make a deci@@ sion on which you &apos;re going to b@@ ase an action .
"For some people it &apos;s only about what is in the im@@ medi@@ ate situ@@ ation , what other people are doing and what you &apos;re feeling ."
"And those people , when they make their deci@@ sions in that form@@ at — we &apos;re going to call them &quot; &quot; pres@@ ent@@ -@@ or@@ ien@@ ted , &quot; &quot; because their fo@@ cus is what is now ."
"For others , the present is ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant ."
It &apos;s always about &quot; &quot; What is this situ@@ ation like that I &apos;ve exper@@ ien@@ ced in the past ? &quot; &quot; So that their deci@@ sions are based on past memor@@ ies .
"And we &apos;re going to call those people &quot; &quot; pa@@ st@@ -@@ or@@ ien@@ ted , &quot; &quot; because they fo@@ cus on what was ."
"For others it &apos;s not the past , it &apos;s not the present , it &apos;s only about the future ."
Th@@ e@@ ir fo@@ cus is always about anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed con@@ sequ@@ ences .
C@@ ost@@ -@@ b@@ en@@ ef@@ it an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s .
We &apos;re going to call them &quot; &quot; fu@@ tu@@ re@@ -@@ or@@ ien@@ ted . &quot; &quot; Th@@ e@@ ir fo@@ cus is on what will be .
"So , time par@@ ad@@ o@@ x , I want to ar@@ gu@@ e , the par@@ ad@@ o@@ x of time perspe@@ ctive , is something that in@@ flu@@ ences every deci@@ sion you make , you &apos;re tot@@ ally u@@ naw@@ are of ."
"N@@ am@@ ely , the ex@@ t@@ ent to which you have one of these bi@@ as@@ ed time perspe@@ cti@@ ves ."
Well there is actually six of them . There are two ways to be pres@@ ent@@ -@@ or@@ ien@@ ted .
"There is two ways to be pa@@ st@@ -@@ or@@ ien@@ ted , two ways to be future ."
"You can fo@@ cus on pa@@ st@@ -@@ posi@@ tive , or pa@@ st@@ -@@ neg@@ ative ."
"You can be pres@@ ent@@ -@@ he@@ d@@ oni@@ stic , na@@ me@@ ly you fo@@ cus on the jo@@ ys of life , or pres@@ ent@@ -@@ f@@ at@@ ali@@ st — it doesn &apos;t matter , your life is contro@@ l@@ led ."
"You can be fu@@ tu@@ re@@ -@@ or@@ ien@@ ted , se@@ tting go@@ als ."
"O@@ r you can be tran@@ scen@@ d@@ ent@@ al future : na@@ me@@ ly , life begin@@ s after death ."
"D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ ping the ment@@ al f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility to shi@@ ft time perspe@@ cti@@ ves flu@@ i@@ d@@ ly depen@@ ding on the de@@ man@@ ds of the situ@@ ation , that &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to learn to do ."
"So , very quickly , what is the op@@ ti@@ mal time pro@@ fi@@ le ?"
Hi@@ gh on pa@@ st@@ -@@ posi@@ tive . M@@ od@@ er@@ ately high on future .
And moder@@ ate on pres@@ ent@@ -@@ he@@ d@@ on@@ is@@ m .
And always low on pa@@ st@@ -@@ neg@@ ative and pres@@ ent@@ -@@ f@@ at@@ ali@@ sm .
"So the op@@ ti@@ mal tem@@ po@@ ral mi@@ x is what you get from the past — pa@@ st@@ -@@ posi@@ tive gi@@ ves you ro@@ ots . You conne@@ ct your family , iden@@ ti@@ ty and your self ."
"What you get from the future is w@@ ings to so@@ ar to new de@@ st@@ in@@ ations , new challen@@ ges ."
"What you get from the present he@@ d@@ on@@ is@@ m is the energy , the energy to expl@@ ore yourself , places , people , sen@@ su@@ ality ."
A@@ ny time perspe@@ ctive in ex@@ cess has more neg@@ ati@@ ves than posi@@ ti@@ ves .
What do fu@@ tu@@ res s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce for suc@@ cess ?
They s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce family time . They s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce friend time .
They s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce fun time . They s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce per@@ s@@ onal indu@@ l@@ g@@ ence .
They s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce h@@ ob@@ b@@ ies . And they s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce sle@@ ep . So it af@@ fe@@ cts their health .
"And they live for work , ach@@ ie@@ v@@ ement and control ."
I &apos;m sure that re@@ son@@ ates with some of the TE@@ D@@ st@@ ers .
"( Laughter ) And it re@@ son@@ ated for me . I gre@@ w up as a po@@ or kid in the S@@ outh B@@ ron@@ x gh@@ et@@ to , a S@@ i@@ ci@@ li@@ an family — everyone li@@ ved in the past and present ."
"I &apos;m here as a fu@@ tu@@ re@@ -@@ or@@ ien@@ ted person who went over the top , who did all these s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ces because teach@@ ers inter@@ ven@@ ed , and made me future or@@ ien@@ ted ."
"T@@ old me don &apos;t e@@ at that mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , because if you wa@@ it you &apos;re going to get two of them , until I learned to bal@@ ance out ."
"I &apos;ve ad@@ ded pres@@ ent@@ -@@ he@@ d@@ on@@ is@@ m , I &apos;ve ad@@ ded a fo@@ cus on the pa@@ st@@ -@@ posi@@ tive , so , at 7@@ 6 years old , I am more ener@@ ge@@ tic than ever , more produ@@ ctive , and I &apos;m ha@@ p@@ pie@@ r than I have ever been ."
"I just want to say that we are ap@@ pl@@ ying this to many world problems : chang@@ ing the dro@@ p@@ -@@ out r@@ ates of school kids , com@@ b@@ ating ad@@ di@@ ctions , en@@ h@@ an@@ cing te@@ en health , cur@@ ing ve@@ ts &apos; P@@ T@@ S@@ D with time me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ors — getting mi@@ rac@@ le cu@@ res — pro@@ mot@@ ing susta@@ in@@ ability and con@@ ser@@ vation , redu@@ cing physi@@ cal re@@ ha@@ bi@@ lit@@ ation where there is a 5@@ 0-@@ percent dro@@ p out r@@ ate , alter@@ ing ap@@ pe@@ als to su@@ i@@ ci@@ d@@ al ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sts , and mo@@ dif@@ ying family con@@ fli@@ cts as ti@@ me@@ -@@ z@@ one clas@@ h@@ es ."
So I want to end by saying : many of life &apos;s pu@@ z@@ z@@ les can be sol@@ ved by under@@ standing your time perspe@@ ctive and that of others .
"And the idea is so simple , so obvi@@ ous , but I think the con@@ sequ@@ ences are really pro@@ found ."
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
"So , I &apos;d like to spend a few minutes with you fol@@ ks today imag@@ ining what our planet might look like in a thous@@ and years ."
"But before I do that , I need to talk to you about syn@@ the@@ tic materi@@ als like pla@@ sti@@ cs , which requi@@ re huge amoun@@ ts of energy to create and , because of their di@@ spos@@ al issu@@ es , are s@@ low@@ ly po@@ is@@ on@@ ing our planet ."
I also want to tell you and share with you how my team and I have been using mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms over the last three years .
"N@@ ot like that . ( Laughter ) We &apos;re using mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms to create an enti@@ re@@ ly new clas@@ s of materi@@ als , which per@@ form a lot like pla@@ sti@@ cs during their use , but are made from cro@@ p wa@@ ste and are tot@@ ally com@@ post@@ able at the end of their lives ."
"( Ch@@ e@@ ering ) But first , I need to talk to you about what I consi@@ der one of the most e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous of@@ f@@ en@@ ders in the di@@ spos@@ able pla@@ sti@@ cs c@@ ate@@ g@@ ory ."
"This is a materi@@ al you all know is S@@ ty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am , but I like to think of it as to@@ x@@ ic white stuff ."
In a single cu@@ bi@@ c fo@@ ot of this materi@@ al — about what would come around your computer or large tele@@ vision — you have the same energy cont@@ ent of about a li@@ ter and a half of pe@@ tro@@ l .
"@@ Y@@ et , after just a few weeks of use , you &apos;ll th@@ row this materi@@ al in the tra@@ sh ."
And this isn &apos;t just found in pac@@ k@@ ag@@ ing .
"@@ 20 billion dollars of this materi@@ al is produ@@ ced every year , in everything from building materi@@ als to sur@@ f@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds to co@@ f@@ fe@@ e cu@@ ps to table top@@ s ."
And that &apos;s not the only place it &apos;s found .
"The E@@ P@@ A est@@ im@@ ates , in the United States , by v@@ olu@@ me , this materi@@ al oc@@ cu@@ pie@@ s 25 percent of our land@@ fil@@ ls ."
E@@ ven wor@@ se is when it fin@@ ds its way into our natural environment — on the side of the ro@@ ad or next to a ri@@ ver .
"If it &apos;s not pi@@ cked up by a human , like me and you , it &apos;ll st@@ ay there for thousands and thousands of years ."
"P@@ er@@ haps even wor@@ se is when it fin@@ ds its way into our oce@@ ans , like in the great pla@@ stic g@@ y@@ re , where these materi@@ als are being mechani@@ cally bro@@ k@@ en into s@@ mal@@ ler and s@@ mal@@ ler bi@@ ts , but they &apos;re not really going away ."
They &apos;re not biologi@@ cally comp@@ ati@@ ble .
They &apos;re basically f@@ ou@@ ling up Earth &apos;s re@@ sp@@ ir@@ at@@ ory and cir@@ cu@@ lat@@ ory systems .
"And because these materi@@ als are so pro@@ li@@ fic , because they &apos;re found in so many places , there &apos;s one other place you &apos;ll find this materi@@ al , sty@@ ren@@ e , which is made from b@@ en@@ z@@ ene , a known car@@ cin@@ og@@ en ."
You &apos;ll find it inside of you .
"So , for all these reas@@ ons , I think we need better materi@@ als , and there are three key prin@@ ci@@ ples we can use to gu@@ i@@ de these materi@@ als ."
The first is fe@@ ed@@ sto@@ cks .
"T@@ od@@ ay , we use a single fe@@ ed@@ sto@@ ck , pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um , to he@@ at our hom@@ es , power our cars and make most of the materi@@ als you see around you ."
"We re@@ cogni@@ ze this is a fini@@ te re@@ source , and it &apos;s simply c@@ razy to do this , to put a li@@ ter and a half of pe@@ tro@@ l in the tra@@ sh every time you get a pac@@ k@@ age ."
"S@@ econ@@ d of all , we should really stri@@ ve to use far less energy in cre@@ ating these materi@@ als ."
"I say far less , because 10 percent isn &apos;t going to cut it ."
"We should be talking about half , a qu@@ ar@@ ter , one@@ -@@ ten@@ th the energy cont@@ ent ."
"And la@@ st@@ ly , and I think per@@ haps most import@@ an@@ tly , we should be cre@@ ating materi@@ als that f@@ it into what I call nature &apos;s re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling system ."
This re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling system has been in place for the last billion years .
"I f@@ it into it , you f@@ it into it , and a hundre@@ d years top@@ s , my body can re@@ turn to the Earth with no pre@@ pro@@ cess@@ ing ."
Y@@ et that pac@@ k@@ ag@@ ing I got in the ma@@ il y@@ est@@ er@@ day is going to last for thousands of years .
This is c@@ razy .
But nature provi@@ des us with a really good model here .
"When a t@@ ree &apos;s done using its lea@@ ves — its solar colle@@ ct@@ ors , these amazing mo@@ le@@ cular ph@@ ot@@ on cap@@ tur@@ ing de@@ vi@@ ces — at the end of a se@@ as@@ on , it doesn &apos;t p@@ ack them up , take them to the lea@@ f re@@ pro@@ cess@@ ing cen@@ ter and have them me@@ l@@ ted down to form new lea@@ ves ."
"It just dro@@ ps them , the shor@@ test di@@ stance possible , to the fore@@ st flo@@ or , where they &apos;re actually up@@ cy@@ c@@ led into next year &apos;s top@@ so@@ il ."
And this gets us back to the mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms .
"Because in nature , mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms are the re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling system ."
"And what we &apos;ve disco@@ vered is , by using a part of the mus@@ h@@ room you &apos;ve probably never seen — an@@ al@@ og@@ ous to its ro@@ ot structure ; it &apos;s called my@@ ce@@ li@@ um — we can actually gro@@ w materi@@ als with many of the same pro@@ per@@ ties of con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal syn@@ the@@ ti@@ cs ."
"Now , my@@ ce@@ li@@ um is an amazing materi@@ al , because it &apos;s a self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ling materi@@ al ."
"It actually takes things we would consi@@ der wa@@ ste — things like se@@ ed h@@ us@@ ks or wo@@ ody bi@@ om@@ as@@ s — and can trans@@ form them into a ch@@ it@@ in@@ ous po@@ ly@@ m@@ er , which you can form into almost any sha@@ pe ."
"In our process , we basically use it as a g@@ lu@@ e ."
"And by using my@@ ce@@ li@@ um as a g@@ lu@@ e , you can mo@@ ld things just like you do in the pla@@ stic indu@@ stry , and you can create materi@@ als with many different pro@@ per@@ ties , materi@@ als that are in@@ su@@ lat@@ ing , fi@@ re@@ -@@ resi@@ st@@ ant , mo@@ i@@ stu@@ re@@ -@@ resi@@ st@@ ant , v@@ a@@ por@@ -@@ resi@@ st@@ ant — materi@@ als that can ab@@ sor@@ b impac@@ ts , that can ab@@ sor@@ b ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ cal impac@@ ts ."
"But these materi@@ als are grow@@ n from agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral by@@ produ@@ cts , not pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um ."
"And because they &apos;re made of natural materi@@ als , they are 100 percent com@@ post@@ able in you own back@@ y@@ ard ."
So I &apos;d like to share with you the four basi@@ c ste@@ ps requi@@ red to make these materi@@ als .
"The first is se@@ le@@ cting a fe@@ ed@@ sto@@ ck , pre@@ fer@@ ably something that &apos;s regi@@ onal , that &apos;s in your area , right — local man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing ."
"The next is actually taking this fe@@ ed@@ sto@@ ck and pu@@ tting in a to@@ ol , physi@@ cally fil@@ ling an en@@ clo@@ sure , a mo@@ ld , in whatever sha@@ pe you want to get ."
"Th@@ en you actually gro@@ w the my@@ ce@@ li@@ um through these parti@@ cles , and that &apos;s where the mag@@ ic happens , because the organi@@ sm is doing the work in this process , not the e@@ qui@@ pment ."
"The fin@@ al ste@@ p is , of course , the produ@@ ct , whether it &apos;s a pac@@ k@@ ag@@ ing materi@@ al , a table top , or building blo@@ ck ."
"O@@ ur vision is local man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , like the local food movement , for produ@@ ction ."
So we &apos;ve created for@@ mul@@ ations for all around the world using regi@@ onal by@@ produ@@ cts .
"If you &apos;re in China , you might use a ri@@ ce h@@ us@@ k or a c@@ ot@@ ton@@ se@@ ed hu@@ ll ."
"If you &apos;re in Nor@@ ther@@ n Europ@@ e or Nor@@ th America , you can use things like bu@@ ck@@ whe@@ at h@@ us@@ ks or o@@ at h@@ ul@@ ls ."
We then process these h@@ us@@ ks with some basi@@ c e@@ qui@@ pment .
And I want to share with you a qui@@ ck video from our fac@@ i@@ lity that gi@@ ves you a sense of how this looks at scale .
"So what you &apos;re seeing here is actually c@@ ot@@ ton h@@ ul@@ ls from T@@ ex@@ as , in this case ."
It &apos;s a wa@@ ste produ@@ ct .
"And what they &apos;re doing in our e@@ qui@@ pment is going through a contin@@ u@@ ous system , which cle@@ ans , co@@ o@@ ks , co@@ ols and pa@@ ste@@ u@@ ri@@ z@@ es these materi@@ als , while also contin@@ u@@ ously in@@ o@@ cu@@ lat@@ ing them with our my@@ ce@@ li@@ um ."
"This gi@@ ves us a contin@@ u@@ ous stre@@ am of materi@@ al that we can put into almost any sha@@ pe , though today we &apos;re making cor@@ ner blo@@ cks ."
"And it &apos;s when this li@@ d goes on the part , that the mag@@ ic really star@@ ts ."
Because the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing process is our organi@@ sm .
"It &apos;ll actually beg@@ in to di@@ gest these wa@@ st@@ es and , over the next five days , as@@ se@@ m@@ ble them into bio@@ com@@ posi@@ tes ."
"O@@ ur entire fac@@ i@@ lity is comp@@ ri@@ sed of thousands and thousands and thousands of these to@@ ols sitting in@@ do@@ ors in the dar@@ k , qu@@ ie@@ tly self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ling materi@@ als — and everything from building materi@@ als to , in this case , a pac@@ k@@ ag@@ ing cor@@ ner blo@@ ck ."
So I &apos;ve said a number of times that we gro@@ w materi@@ als .
And it &apos;s kind of hard to picture how that happens .
"So my team has taken five da@@ y@@ s@@ -@@ wor@@ th of grow@@ th , a ty@@ pi@@ cal grow@@ th cy@@ cle for us , and con@@ den@@ sed it into a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ second time lap@@ se ."
"And I want you to really wat@@ ch clo@@ se@@ ly these little white d@@ ots on the scre@@ en , because , over the fi@@ ve@@ -@@ day per@@ i@@ od , what they do is ex@@ ten@@ d out and through this materi@@ al , using the energy that &apos;s con@@ ta@@ ined in these se@@ ed h@@ us@@ ks to build this ch@@ it@@ in@@ ous po@@ ly@@ m@@ er mat@@ ri@@ x ."
"This mat@@ ri@@ x self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ les , grow@@ ing through and around the parti@@ cles , making mi@@ llions and mi@@ llions of t@@ iny fi@@ bers ."
"And what par@@ ts of the se@@ ed h@@ us@@ k we don &apos;t di@@ gest , actually become part of the fin@@ al , physi@@ cal com@@ posi@@ te ."
"So in front of your eyes , this part just self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ led ."
It actually takes a little longer . It takes five days .
But it &apos;s much f@@ ast@@ er than con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal far@@ ming .
"The last ste@@ p , of course , is app@@ lic@@ ation ."
"In this case , we &apos;ve grow@@ n a cor@@ ner blo@@ ck ."
A major F@@ or@@ tu@@ ne 500 f@@ ur@@ ni@@ ture mak@@ er uses these cor@@ ner blo@@ cks to prote@@ ct their tab@@ les in shi@@ pment .
"They used to use a pla@@ stic pac@@ k@@ ag@@ ing bu@@ f@@ f@@ er , but we were able to give them the ex@@ act same physi@@ cal perform@@ ance with our grow@@ n materi@@ al ."
"B@@ est of all , when it gets to the cu@@ st@@ om@@ er , it &apos;s not tra@@ sh ."
"They can actually put this in their natural e@@ co@@ system without any pro@@ cess@@ ing , and it &apos;s going to impro@@ ve the local so@@ il ."
"So , why my@@ ce@@ li@@ um ?"
The first reason is local open fe@@ ed@@ sto@@ cks .
"You want to be able to do this any@@ where in the world and not wor@@ ry about pe@@ ak ri@@ ce hu@@ ll or pe@@ ak c@@ ot@@ ton@@ se@@ ed h@@ ul@@ ls , because you have mul@@ ti@@ ple cho@@ i@@ ces ."
"The next is self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ bly , because the organi@@ sm is actually doing most of the work in this process ."
You don &apos;t need a lot of e@@ qui@@ pment to set up a produ@@ ction fac@@ i@@ lity .
So you can have lots of small fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ies sp@@ read all across the world .
Bi@@ ologi@@ cal y@@ ie@@ ld is really important .
"And because 100 percent of what we put in the to@@ ol become the fin@@ al produ@@ ct , even the par@@ ts that ar@@ en &apos;t di@@ g@@ est@@ ed become part of the structure , we &apos;re getting incredible y@@ ie@@ ld r@@ ates ."
"N@@ at@@ u@@ ral po@@ ly@@ m@@ ers , well ... I think that &apos;s what &apos;s most important , because these po@@ ly@@ m@@ ers have been tr@@ ied and test@@ ed in our e@@ co@@ system for the last billion years , in everything from mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms to c@@ ru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans ."
They &apos;re not going to clo@@ g up Earth &apos;s e@@ co@@ systems . They work great .
"And while , today , we can prac@@ ti@@ cally gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e that y@@ est@@ er@@ day &apos;s pac@@ k@@ ag@@ ing is going to be here in 1@@ 0,000 years , what I want to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e is that in 1@@ 0,000 years , our des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts , our children &apos;s children , will be living ha@@ p@@ pi@@ ly and in har@@ mon@@ y with a health@@ y Earth ."
And I think that can be some really good news .
Thank you .

"In the ocean , what is the common point between oil , pla@@ stic and radi@@ o@@ acti@@ vity ?"
"O@@ n the top line , this is the B@@ P oil spi@@ ll : bi@@ llions of bar@@ re@@ ls of oil g@@ us@@ h@@ ing in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ exi@@ co ."
"The mi@@ ddle line is mi@@ llions of t@@ ons of pla@@ stic de@@ br@@ is ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ lat@@ ing in our ocean , and the third line is radi@@ o@@ ac@@ tive materi@@ al le@@ aking from F@@ u@@ k@@ us@@ hi@@ ma nuclear power pl@@ ant in the P@@ aci@@ fic O@@ ce@@ an ."
"Well , the three big problems have in common that they are man@@ -@@ made problems but they are contro@@ l@@ led by natural for@@ ces ."
"This should make us feel very , terri@@ bly aw@@ ful as much as it should make us feel hop@@ e@@ ful , because if we have the power to create these problems , we may as well have the power to re@@ medi@@ ate these problems ."
But what about natural for@@ ces ?
"Well , that &apos;s exactly what I want to talk about today , is how we can use these natural for@@ ces to re@@ medi@@ ate these man@@ -@@ made problems ."
"When the B@@ P oil spi@@ ll happened , I was working at M@@ I@@ T , and I was in char@@ ge of develo@@ ping an oil sp@@ il@@ l-@@ cle@@ an@@ ing technology ."
And I had a ch@@ ance to go in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ exi@@ co and me@@ et some fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men and see the terri@@ ble con@@ di@@ tions in which they were working .
"M@@ ore than 7@@ 00 of these bo@@ ats , which are fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men bo@@ ats re@@ pur@@ posed with oil ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ent in white and oil con@@ tain@@ ment in or@@ ange , were used , but they only colle@@ cted three percent of the oil on the surface , and the health of the cle@@ an@@ ers were very de@@ e@@ ply af@@ fe@@ cted ."
"I was working on a very interesting technology at M@@ I@@ T , but it was a very lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m view of how to develo@@ p technology , and it was going to be a very ex@@ pen@@ sive technology , and also it would be pat@@ en@@ ted ."
"So I wanted to develo@@ p something that we could develo@@ p very f@@ ast , that would be che@@ a@@ p , and that would be open@@ -@@ source , so , because oil sp@@ il@@ ls are not only happening in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ exi@@ co , and that would be using r@@ ene@@ wa@@ ble energy ."
"So I qu@@ it my dre@@ am job , and I mo@@ ved to New O@@ r@@ le@@ ans , and I ke@@ pt on stu@@ dy@@ ing how the oil spi@@ ll was happening ."
"C@@ ur@@ r@@ ently , what they were doing is that they were using these small fi@@ sh@@ ing bo@@ ats , and they were cle@@ an@@ ing cle@@ an lin@@ es in an ocean of di@@ r@@ t ."
"If you &apos;re using the ex@@ act same amount of surface of oil ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ent , but you &apos;re just pa@@ ying at@@ ten@@ tion to natural pat@@ ter@@ ns , and if you &apos;re going up the win@@ ds , you can colle@@ ct a lot more materi@@ al ."
"If you &apos;re mul@@ ti@@ pl@@ ying the ri@@ g , so you mul@@ ti@@ ply how many la@@ y@@ ers of ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ent you &apos;re using , you can colle@@ ct a lot more ."
"But it &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly difficult to move oil ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ent against the win@@ ds , the surface cur@@ r@@ ents and the wa@@ ves ."
These are en@@ or@@ m@@ ous for@@ ces .
So the very simple idea was to use the an@@ cient techni@@ qu@@ e of sa@@ il@@ ing and t@@ ac@@ king of the wind to cap@@ ture or inter@@ cept the oil that is dri@@ f@@ ting down the wind .
So this didn &apos;t requi@@ re any inv@@ en@@ tion .
"We just took a simple sa@@ il@@ ing boat and we tr@@ ied to pu@@ ll something long and he@@ av@@ y , but as we t@@ ac@@ ked back and for@@ th , what we lost was two things : we were lo@@ sing pul@@ ling power and dire@@ ction ."
"And so , I thought , what about if we just take the ru@@ d@@ der from the back of the boat to the front , would we have better control ?"
"So I built this small sa@@ il@@ ing robot with the ru@@ d@@ der at the front , and I was trying to pu@@ ll something very long and he@@ av@@ y , so that &apos;s a f@@ our@@ -@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ long obje@@ ct just to pu@@ ll , and I was sur@@ pri@@ sed with just a 1@@ 4@@ -@@ cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter ru@@ d@@ der , I could control four me@@ ters of ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ent ."
"Th@@ en I was so happy that I ke@@ pt playing with the robot , and so you see the robot has a front ru@@ d@@ der here ."
Nor@@ m@@ ally it &apos;s at the back .
"And , playing , I realized that the man@@ e@@ u@@ ver@@ ability of this was really amazing , and I could av@@ o@@ id an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le at the very last second , more man@@ e@@ u@@ ver@@ able than a nor@@ mal boat ."
"Th@@ en I started publi@@ sh@@ ing on@@ line , and some friends from Kore@@ a , they started being interested in this , and we made a boat which has a front ru@@ d@@ der and a back ru@@ d@@ der , so we started inter@@ ac@@ ting with this , and it was sli@@ gh@@ tly better , al@@ though it was very small and a bit off bal@@ ance , but then we thought , what if we have more than two poin@@ ts of control ?"
What if the entire boat be@@ comes a point of control ?
What if the entire boat chang@@ es sha@@ pe ?
"So — ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) And so that &apos;s the beginning of Pro@@ te@@ i , and that &apos;s the first boat in history that completely changed the sha@@ pe of the hu@@ ll in order to control it , and the pro@@ per@@ ties of sa@@ il@@ ing that we get are very super@@ i@@ or com@@ par@@ ed to a nor@@ mal boat ."
"When we &apos;re tur@@ ning , we have the feeling of sur@@ f@@ ing , and the way it &apos;s going up@@ -@@ wind , it &apos;s very ef@@ fi@@ cient ."
"This is low speed , low wind speed , and the man@@ e@@ u@@ ver@@ ability is very incre@@ as@@ ed , and here I &apos;m going to do a small j@@ i@@ be , and look at the posi@@ tion of the sa@@ il ."
"What &apos;s happening is that , because the boat chang@@ es sha@@ pe , the posi@@ tion of the front sa@@ il and the ma@@ in sa@@ il are different to the wind ."
We &apos;re cat@@ ching wind from both si@@ des .
And this is exactly what we &apos;re looking &#91; for &#93; if we want to pu@@ ll something long and he@@ av@@ y .
"We don &apos;t want to lo@@ se pul@@ ling power , no@@ r dire@@ ction ."
"So , I wanted to know if this was possible to put this at an indu@@ stri@@ al level , so we made a large boat with a large sa@@ il , and with a very light hu@@ ll , in@@ f@@ lat@@ able , very small fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int , so we have a very big size and power r@@ ati@@ o ."
"A@@ f@@ ter this , we wanted to see if we could im@@ ple@@ ment this and au@@ tom@@ ate the system , so we used the same system but we ad@@ ded a structure to it so we could acti@@ v@@ ate the mach@@ ine ."
"So , we used the same bl@@ ad@@ der@@ -@@ in@@ f@@ lated system , and we took it for test@@ ing ."
So this is happening in the Ne@@ ther@@ l@@ ands .
We tr@@ ied in the water without any sk@@ in or bal@@ last just to see how it works .
"And then we m@@ oun@@ ted a cam@@ era for contro@@ l@@ ling it , but quickly we saw that we would need a lot more we@@ ight at the bot@@ tom , so we had to take it back to the la@@ b , and then we built a sk@@ in around it , we put bat@@ ter@@ ies , re@@ mot@@ e contro@@ ll@@ ers , and then we put it in the water and then we let it go in the water and see how well it would work , so let some rop@@ e out , and hope it &apos;s going to work , and it worked o@@ kay , but we still have a long way ."
"O@@ ur small pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pe has given us good in@@ si@@ ght that it &apos;s working very well , but we still need to work a lot more on this ."
So what we are doing is an ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated ev@@ olution of sa@@ il@@ ing technology .
"We went from a back ru@@ d@@ der to a front ru@@ d@@ der to two ru@@ dd@@ ers to mul@@ ti@@ ple ru@@ dd@@ ers to the whole boat chang@@ ing sha@@ pe , and the more we are moving forward , and the more the design looks simple and cu@@ te . ( Laughter ) But I wanted to show you a fish because — In fact , it &apos;s very different from a fish ."
"A fish will move because — by chang@@ ing like this , but our boat is pro@@ pe@@ l@@ led by the wind still , and the hu@@ ll contro@@ ls the tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory ."
"So I brought to you for the first time on the TED st@@ age Pro@@ te@@ i N@@ um@@ ber E@@ ight . It &apos;s not the last one , but it &apos;s a good one for making demo@@ s ."
"So the first thing as I show you in the video is that we may be able to control the tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory of a sa@@ il@@ ing boat better , or we may be able to never be in i@@ ron@@ s , so never fac@@ ing the wind , we always can cat@@ ch the wind from both si@@ des ."
But new pro@@ per@@ ties of a sa@@ il@@ ing boat .
"So if you &apos;re looking at the boat from this side , this might re@@ mind you of an air@@ pl@@ ane pro@@ fi@@ le ."
"A@@ n air@@ pl@@ ane , when you &apos;re moving in this dire@@ ction , star@@ ts to li@@ ft , and that &apos;s how it takes off ."
"Now , if you &apos;re taking the same system , and you &apos;re pu@@ tting ver@@ tical , you &apos;re b@@ ending , and if you &apos;re moving this way forward , your in@@ st@@ in@@ ct will tell you that you might go this way , but if you &apos;re moving f@@ ast enough , you might create what we call lat@@ er@@ al li@@ ft , so we could get f@@ ur@@ ther or clo@@ s@@ er to the wind ."
"O@@ ther pro@@ per@@ ty is this : A nor@@ mal sa@@ il@@ ing boat has a cen@@ ter@@ bo@@ ard here and a ru@@ d@@ der at the back , and these two things are what cre@@ ates most resi@@ stance and tur@@ bu@@ l@@ ence behind the boat , but because this doesn &apos;t have either a cen@@ ter@@ bo@@ ard or a ru@@ d@@ der , we hope that if we keep working on this hu@@ ll design we can impro@@ ve and have less resi@@ stance ."
"The other thing is , most bo@@ ats , when they re@@ ach a certain speed , and they are going on wa@@ ves , they start to h@@ it and s@@ la@@ p on the surface of the water , and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost ."
"But if we &apos;re going with the f@@ low , if we pay at@@ ten@@ tion to natural pat@@ ter@@ ns instead of trying to be stron@@ g , but if you &apos;re going with the f@@ low , we may ab@@ sor@@ b a lot of environ@@ ment@@ al no@@ is@@ es , so the wa@@ ve energy , to actually sa@@ ve some energy to move forward ."
"So we may have develo@@ ped the technology which is very ef@@ fi@@ cient for pul@@ ling something long and he@@ av@@ y , but the idea is , what is the pur@@ pos@@ e of technology if it doesn &apos;t re@@ ach the right h@@ ands ?"
"N@@ or@@ mal technology or in@@ no@@ vation happens like this : S@@ ome@@ body has an interesting idea , some other scienti@@ st or engine@@ er , they take it to the next level , they make a the@@ ory about it and maybe they pat@@ ent it , and then some indu@@ stry will make a con@@ trac@@ t of ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vity to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture and se@@ ll it , and then , ev@@ en@@ tually , a bu@@ y@@ er will bu@@ y it , and we hope that they are going to use &#91; it &#93; for a good pur@@ pos@@ e ."
"What we really want is that this in@@ no@@ vation happens contin@@ u@@ ously . The inv@@ ent@@ or and engine@@ ers and also the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers and everybody works at the same time , but this would be st@@ eri@@ le if this was happening in a par@@ al@@ le@@ l and un@@ cro@@ s@@ sed process ."
"What you really want is not a sequ@@ enti@@ al , not par@@ al@@ le@@ l develo@@ pment ."
You want to have a network of in@@ no@@ vation .
"You want everybody , like we &apos;re doing now , to work at the same time , and that can only happen if these people all together deci@@ de to share the information , and that &apos;s exactly what open har@@ dw@@ are is about ."
It &apos;s to re@@ place compe@@ ti@@ tion by col@@ labor@@ ation .
It &apos;s to trans@@ form any new produ@@ ct into a new market .
So what is open har@@ dw@@ are ?
"E@@ s@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally , open har@@ dw@@ are is a li@@ cen@@ se ."
It &apos;s just an in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al pro@@ per@@ ty se@@ tu@@ p .
"It means that everybody is f@@ ree to use , mo@@ dif@@ y and di@@ stri@@ bu@@ te , and in ex@@ change we only ask for two things : The name is cre@@ di@@ ted — the name of the project — and also the people who make impro@@ v@@ ement , they share back with the community ."
So it &apos;s a very simple con@@ di@@ tion .
"And I started this project alone in a gar@@ age in New O@@ r@@ le@@ ans , but quickly after I wanted to publi@@ sh and share this information , so I made a K@@ i@@ ck@@ star@@ ter , which is a c@@ row@@ d-@@ fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing pl@@ at@@ form , and in about one mon@@ th we fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ed 3@@ 0,000 dollars ."
"Wi@@ th this money , I hi@@ red a team of young engine@@ ers from all over the world , and we ren@@ ted a fac@@ t@@ ory in R@@ ot@@ ter@@ d@@ am in the Ne@@ ther@@ l@@ ands ."
"We were pe@@ er@@ -@@ lear@@ ning , we were engine@@ ering , we were making things , pro@@ t@@ oty@@ ping , but most import@@ an@@ tly we were trying our pro@@ t@@ oty@@ p@@ es in the water as often as possible , to fa@@ il as quickly as possible , to learn from ."
"This is a pro@@ u@@ d member of Pro@@ te@@ i from Kore@@ a , and on the right side , this is a mul@@ ti@@ ple@@ -@@ ma@@ sts design pro@@ posed by a team in M@@ exi@@ co ."
"This idea really ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ed to G@@ ab@@ r@@ ie@@ l@@ la L@@ ev@@ ine in New York , and so she decided to pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pe this idea that she saw , and she do@@ cu@@ men@@ ted every ste@@ p of the process , and she publi@@ shed it on In@@ stru@@ ct@@ ab@@ les , which is a we@@ b@@ site for sh@@ aring inv@@ en@@ tions ."
"L@@ ess than one week after , this is a team in E@@ in@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , it &apos;s a school of engine@@ ering ."
"They made it , but they ev@@ en@@ tually publi@@ shed a sim@@ pli@@ f@@ ied design ."
"They also made it into an In@@ stru@@ ct@@ able , and in less than one week , they had almost 1@@ 0,000 vie@@ ws , and they got many new friends ."
"We &apos;re working on also sim@@ ple@@ r technology , not that comple@@ x , with youn@@ ger people and also ol@@ der people , like this din@@ o@@ sa@@ ur is from M@@ exi@@ co . ( Laughter ) So Pro@@ te@@ i is now an inter@@ national network of in@@ no@@ vation for sel@@ ling technology using this sha@@ pe@@ -@@ shi@@ f@@ ting hu@@ ll ."
"And what pu@@ ts us together is that we have a common , at least , global under@@ standing of what the word &quot; &quot; business &quot; &quot; is , or what it should be ."
This is how most work today .
"B@@ us@@ iness as usu@@ al is saying , what &apos;s most important is to make lots of prof@@ it , and you &apos;ll be using technology for that , and people will be your work force , instru@@ ment@@ aliz@@ ed , and environment is usu@@ ally the last pri@@ ori@@ ty ."
"It will be just a way to , say , gre@@ en@@ wa@@ sh your audience and , say , incre@@ ase your pri@@ ce ta@@ g ."
"What we &apos;re trying to do , or what we believe , because this is how we believe the world really works , is that without the environment you have nothing ."
"We have the people so we need to prote@@ ct each other , y@@ es , and we &apos;re a technology company , and prof@@ it is ne@@ cess@@ ary to make this happen . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) If we have the cou@@ ra@@ ge to understand or ac@@ cept that this actually how the world really works , and this is the order of pri@@ ori@@ ty that we need to cho@@ ose , then it makes obvi@@ ous why we need to cho@@ ose open har@@ dw@@ are for develo@@ ping environ@@ ment@@ al technology , because we need to share information ."
What &apos;s next for us ?
"So , this small mach@@ ine that you &apos;ve seen , we &apos;re hop@@ ing to make small to@@ ys like one@@ -@@ me@@ ter re@@ mot@@ e control Pro@@ te@@ i that you can up@@ gra@@ de — so re@@ place the re@@ mot@@ e control par@@ ts by An@@ dro@@ i@@ ds , so the mo@@ bi@@ le phone , and Ar@@ du@@ in@@ o micro@@ -@@ contro@@ l@@ ler , so you could be contro@@ l@@ ling this from your mo@@ bi@@ le phone , your tab@@ let ."
"Th@@ en what we want to do is create si@@ x@@ -@@ me@@ ter ver@@ sions so we can test the ma@@ x@@ i@@ mu@@ m perform@@ ance of these mach@@ ines , so we can go at very , very high speed ."
So imagine yourself .
"You are la@@ ying down in a f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble tor@@ pe@@ do , sa@@ il@@ ing at high speed , contro@@ l@@ ling the sha@@ pe of the hu@@ ll with your le@@ gs and contro@@ l@@ ling the sa@@ il with your ar@@ ms ."
"So that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking for develo@@ ping . ( Applause ) And we re@@ place the human being — to go , for example , for meas@@ ur@@ ing radi@@ o@@ acti@@ vity , you don &apos;t want a human to be sa@@ il@@ ing those rob@@ ots — with bat@@ ter@@ ies , mot@@ ors , micro@@ -@@ contro@@ ll@@ ers and sen@@ sor@@ s ."
"This is what our te@@ am@@ mat@@ es , we dre@@ am of at night ."
"We hope that we can some@@ time cle@@ an up oil sp@@ il@@ ls , or we can ga@@ ther or colle@@ ct pla@@ stic in the ocean , or we can have s@@ war@@ ms of our mach@@ ines contro@@ l@@ led by mul@@ ti@@ -@@ pla@@ y@@ er video g@@ ame en@@ gin@@ es to control many of these mach@@ ines , to mon@@ it@@ or cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s or to mon@@ it@@ or fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies ."
O@@ ur hope is that we can use open har@@ dw@@ are technology to better understand and prote@@ ct our oce@@ ans .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
"I was spe@@ aking to a group of about 3@@ 00 kids , ages six to eight , at a children &apos;s mus@@ e@@ um , and I brought with me a ba@@ g full of le@@ gs , si@@ mi@@ lar to the kinds of things you see up here , and had them la@@ id out on a table for the kids ."
"And , from my experience , you know , kids are natur@@ ally cu@@ ri@@ ous about what they don &apos;t know , or don &apos;t understand , or is fore@@ ig@@ n to them ."
"They only learn to be f@@ ri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of those differ@@ ences when an ad@@ ul@@ t in@@ flu@@ ences them to be@@ have that way , and maybe cen@@ sor@@ s that natural cu@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty , or you know , re@@ ins in the questi@@ on-@@ as@@ king in the hop@@ es of them being poli@@ te little kids ."
"So I just pi@@ ctu@@ red a first gra@@ de teach@@ er out in the lob@@ by with these un@@ ru@@ ly kids , saying , &quot; &quot; Now , whatever you do , don &apos;t st@@ are at her le@@ gs . &quot; &quot; But , of course , that &apos;s the point ."
"That &apos;s why I was there , I wanted to in@@ vi@@ te them to look and expl@@ ore ."
So I made a deal with the ad@@ ul@@ ts that the kids could come in without any ad@@ ul@@ ts for two minutes on their own .
"The do@@ ors open , the kids des@@ cen@@ d on this table of le@@ gs , and they are po@@ king and pro@@ d@@ ding , and they &apos;re wi@@ g@@ gl@@ ing to@@ es , and they &apos;re trying to put their full we@@ ight on the sp@@ r@@ in@@ ting le@@ g to see what happens with that ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; K@@ i@@ ds , really quickly — I wo@@ ke up this morning , I decided I wanted to be able to j@@ um@@ p over a house — nothing too big , two or three stories — but , if you could think of any ani@@ mal , any super@@ her@@ o , any car@@ to@@ on char@@ ac@@ ter , anything you can dre@@ am up right now , what kind of le@@ gs would you build me ? &quot; &quot; And im@@ medi@@ ately a vo@@ ice sh@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; &quot; K@@ ang@@ aro@@ o ! &quot; &quot; &quot; No , no , no ! S@@ h@@ ould be a fro@@ g ! &quot;"
&quot; No . It should be G@@ o G@@ o G@@ ad@@ get ! &quot;
"&quot; No , no , no ! It should be the In@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ les . &quot;"
And other things that I don &apos;t — ar@@ en &apos;t fami@@ li@@ ar with .
"And then , one e@@ igh@@ t-@@ year@@ -@@ old said , &quot; H@@ ey , why wouldn &apos;t you want to f@@ ly too ? &quot;"
"And the whole room , inclu@@ ding me , was like , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And just like that , I went from being a woman that these kids would have been tra@@ ined to see as &quot; &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; &quot; to somebody that had poten@@ tial that their bod@@ ies didn &apos;t have yet ."
S@@ ome@@ body that might even be super@@ -@@ ab@@ led .
Inter@@ est@@ ing .
"So some of you actually saw me at TED , 11 years ago ."
"And there &apos;s been a lot of talk about how li@@ fe@@ -@@ chang@@ ing this con@@ fer@@ ence is for both spe@@ ak@@ ers and at@@ ten@@ de@@ es , and I am no ex@@ cep@@ tion ."
TED liter@@ ally was the la@@ un@@ ch p@@ ad to the next dec@@ ade of my life &apos;s expl@@ or@@ ation .
"A@@ t the time , the le@@ gs I pre@@ sen@@ ted were gro@@ un@@ d@@ bre@@ aking in pro@@ s@@ the@@ ti@@ cs ."
"I had wo@@ ven car@@ b@@ on fi@@ ber sp@@ r@@ in@@ ting le@@ gs mode@@ led after the hind le@@ g of a che@@ e@@ ta@@ h , which you may have seen on st@@ age y@@ est@@ er@@ day ."
"And also these very li@@ fe@@ -@@ like , in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ cally pain@@ ted si@@ lic@@ one le@@ gs ."
"So at the time , it was my opportunity to put a call out to in@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ ors outside the tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal medi@@ cal pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic community to come bring their tal@@ ent to the science and to the art of building le@@ gs ."
"So that we can stop com@@ part@@ ment@@ aliz@@ ing form , fun@@ ction and a@@ es@@ the@@ tic , and as@@ sig@@ ning them different val@@ u@@ es ."
"Well , lu@@ ck@@ y for me , a lot of people ans@@ wer@@ ed that call ."
"And the jour@@ ney started , fun@@ ny enough , with a TED con@@ fer@@ ence at@@ ten@@ de@@ e — Ch@@ e@@ e P@@ ear@@ l@@ man , who hop@@ e@@ fully is in the audience some@@ where today ."
"S@@ he was the e@@ di@@ tor then of a mag@@ az@@ ine called I@@ D , and she gave me a co@@ ver story ."
This started an incredible jour@@ ney .
C@@ u@@ ri@@ ous en@@ coun@@ ters were happening to me at the time ; I &apos;d been ac@@ cep@@ ting num@@ er@@ ous in@@ vi@@ t@@ ations to speak on the design of the che@@ e@@ ta@@ h le@@ gs around the world .
"And people would come up to me after the con@@ fer@@ ence , after my talk , men and women ."
"And the convers@@ ation would go something like this , &quot; &quot; You know A@@ i@@ me@@ e , you &apos;re very at@@ trac@@ tive ."
"You don &apos;t look dis@@ ab@@ led . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s amazing , because I don &apos;t feel dis@@ ab@@ led . &quot; &quot; And it really open@@ ed my eyes to this convers@@ ation that could be ex@@ plo@@ red , about beau@@ ty ."
What does a beautiful woman have to look like ?
What is a se@@ x@@ y body ?
"And interest@@ ing@@ ly , from an iden@@ ti@@ ty stan@@ d@@ point , what does it mean to have a dis@@ ability ?"
"I mean , people — P@@ am@@ el@@ a An@@ der@@ son has more pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic in her body than I do ."
N@@ ob@@ ody cal@@ ls her dis@@ ab@@ led .
"( Laughter ) So this mag@@ az@@ ine , through the h@@ ands of gra@@ phi@@ c desig@@ ner Pe@@ ter S@@ avi@@ l@@ le , went to fas@@ hi@@ on desig@@ ner A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der M@@ c@@ Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , and photograph@@ er Ni@@ ck K@@ night , who were also interested in expl@@ or@@ ing that convers@@ ation ."
"So , three months after TED I found myself on a pl@@ ane to Lon@@ don , doing my first fas@@ hi@@ on sho@@ ot , which resul@@ ted in this co@@ ver — &quot; &quot; F@@ as@@ hi@@ on-@@ able &quot; &quot; ?"
"Th@@ ree months after that , I did my first ru@@ n@@ way show for A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der M@@ c@@ Q@@ u@@ e@@ en on a pa@@ ir of hand@@ -@@ car@@ ved wo@@ o@@ den le@@ gs made from so@@ li@@ d as@@ h ."
N@@ ob@@ ody knew — everyone thought they were wo@@ o@@ den bo@@ ots .
"A@@ c@@ tually , I have them on st@@ age with me : gra@@ pe@@ v@@ ines , mag@@ no@@ li@@ as — tru@@ ly st@@ un@@ ning ."
Po@@ e@@ try mat@@ ters .
Po@@ e@@ try is what ele@@ v@@ ates the ban@@ al and neg@@ le@@ cted obje@@ ct to a re@@ al@@ m of art .
"It can trans@@ form the thing that might have made people fe@@ ar@@ ful into something that in@@ vi@@ tes them to look , and look a little longer , and maybe even understand ."
I learned this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and with my next ad@@ ven@@ ture .
"The arti@@ st M@@ at@@ the@@ w Bar@@ ney , in his film op@@ us called the &quot; &quot; The C@@ re@@ ma@@ ster C@@ y@@ cle . &quot; &quot; This is where it really h@@ it home for me — that my le@@ gs could be we@@ ar@@ able s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ."
"And even at this point , I started to move away from the need to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate hum@@ an@@ -@@ ness as the only a@@ es@@ the@@ tic ide@@ al ."
"So we made what people lo@@ v@@ ing@@ ly re@@ fer@@ red to as gl@@ as@@ s le@@ gs even though they &apos;re actually op@@ ti@@ cally clear po@@ ly@@ u@@ re@@ th@@ ane , a@@ .@@ k@@ .@@ a@@ . bow@@ ling ball materi@@ al ."
H@@ e@@ av@@ y !
"Th@@ en we made these le@@ gs that are c@@ ast in so@@ il with a po@@ ta@@ to ro@@ ot system grow@@ ing in them , and be@@ e@@ tro@@ ots out the top , and a very lo@@ vely bra@@ ss to@@ e ."
That &apos;s a good clo@@ se@@ -@@ up of that one .
"Th@@ en another char@@ ac@@ ter was a hal@@ f-@@ woman , hal@@ f-@@ che@@ e@@ ta@@ h — a little hom@@ age to my life as an a@@ th@@ le@@ te ."
"@@ 14 hours of pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic mak@@ e-@@ up to get into a cre@@ ature that had arti@@ cu@@ lated p@@ aw@@ s , cl@@ aw@@ s and a ta@@ il that whi@@ pped around , like a ge@@ c@@ ko ."
"( Laughter ) And then another pa@@ ir of le@@ gs we col@@ labor@@ ated on were these — look like je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish le@@ gs , also po@@ ly@@ u@@ re@@ th@@ ane ."
"And the only pur@@ pos@@ e that these le@@ gs can ser@@ ve , outside the con@@ te@@ xt of the film , is to pro@@ vo@@ ke the sen@@ ses and ig@@ ni@@ te the imag@@ in@@ ation ."
So wh@@ im@@ sy mat@@ ters .
"T@@ od@@ ay , I have over a do@@ z@@ en pa@@ ir of pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic le@@ gs that v@@ ari@@ ous people have made for me , and with them I have different neg@@ oti@@ ations of the ter@@ ra@@ in under my fe@@ et , and I can change my he@@ ight — I have a v@@ ari@@ able of five different he@@ igh@@ ts ."
"( Laughter ) T@@ od@@ ay , I &apos;m 6 &apos; 1 &quot; &quot; ."
"And I had these le@@ gs made a little over a year ago at D@@ or@@ set O@@ r@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c in En@@ gl@@ and and when I brought them home to M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an , my first night out on the tow@@ n , I went to a very fan@@ cy par@@ ty ."
And a girl was there who has known me for years at my nor@@ mal 5 &apos; 8 &quot; &quot; .
"H@@ er m@@ outh dro@@ pped open when she saw me , and she went , &quot; &quot; But you &apos;re so t@@ all ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I know . I@@ sn &apos;t it fun ? &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s a little bit like we@@ aring st@@ il@@ ts on st@@ il@@ ts , but I have an enti@@ re@@ ly new relation@@ ship to door j@@ am@@ s that I never expe@@ cted I would ever have ."
And I was having fun with it .
"And she looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; But , A@@ i@@ me@@ e , that &apos;s not fa@@ ir . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And the incredible thing was she really me@@ ant it ."
"It &apos;s not fa@@ ir that you can change your he@@ ight , as you want it ."
And that &apos;s when I knew — that &apos;s when I knew that the convers@@ ation with society has changed prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly in this last dec@@ ade .
It is no longer a convers@@ ation about over@@ coming de@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy .
It &apos;s a convers@@ ation about au@@ g@@ ment@@ ation .
It &apos;s a convers@@ ation about poten@@ tial .
A pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic lim@@ b doesn &apos;t re@@ present the need to re@@ place lo@@ ss any@@ more .
It can stand as a sym@@ bo@@ l that the we@@ ar@@ er has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space .
So people that society once consi@@ der@@ ed to be dis@@ ab@@ led can now become the archite@@ cts of their own iden@@ ti@@ ties and in@@ de@@ ed contin@@ ue to change those iden@@ ti@@ ties by desig@@ ning their bod@@ ies from a place of em@@ power@@ ment .
"And what is exci@@ ting to me so much right now is that by com@@ b@@ ining cu@@ t@@ t@@ ing@@ -@@ ed@@ ge technology — rob@@ oti@@ cs , bi@@ oni@@ cs — with the ag@@ e-@@ old po@@ e@@ try , we are moving clo@@ s@@ er to under@@ standing our colle@@ ctive hum@@ ani@@ ty ."
"I think that if we want to disco@@ ver the full poten@@ tial in our hum@@ ani@@ ty , we need to ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate those hear@@ t@@ bre@@ aking str@@ eng@@ ths and those gl@@ ori@@ ous dis@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies that we all have ."
"I think of S@@ ha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are &apos;s S@@ hy@@ lo@@ ck : &quot; &quot; If you pri@@ ck us , do we not b@@ le@@ ed , and if you ti@@ ck@@ le us , do we not l@@ au@@ gh ? &quot; &quot; It is our hum@@ ani@@ ty , and all the poten@@ tial within it , that makes us beautiful ."
Thank you .

"A@@ ll across E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Europ@@ e , a most mom@@ ent@@ ous e@@ pis@@ od@@ e in our post@@ -@@ war history ."
Now it &apos;s time for full di@@ sc@@ lo@@ sure .
This ev@@ ent me@@ ant a great deal to me per@@ son@@ ally .

O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously there were char@@ ac@@ ters like this .
But there were also some more u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted people who pla@@ yed a cri@@ tical ro@@ le in what was going on in E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Europ@@ e .
Li@@ ke this char@@ ac@@ ter . Re@@ member these guys ?
"They used to wi@@ n the g@@ old me@@ d@@ als in we@@ igh@@ t@@ li@@ f@@ ting and w@@ re@@ st@@ ling , every four years in the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ cs , and they were the great ce@@ le@@ bri@@ ties of communi@@ sm , with a f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le to go with it ."
"They used to get great a@@ part@@ ments in the cen@@ ter of tow@@ n , c@@ as@@ u@@ al se@@ x on ta@@ p , and they could tra@@ vel to the W@@ est very fre@@ ely , which was a great lu@@ x@@ ury at the time ."
"It may come as a sur@@ pri@@ se , but they pla@@ yed a cri@@ tical ro@@ le in the em@@ er@@ g@@ ence of the market econom@@ y in E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Europ@@ e ."
"O@@ r as I like to call them , they are the mi@@ d@@ wi@@ ves of ca@@ pit@@ ali@@ sm ."
Here are some of those same we@@ igh@@ t@@ li@@ f@@ ters after their 19@@ 8@@ 9 mak@@ e@@ over .
"Now in Bu@@ l@@ gar@@ ia — this photogra@@ ph was taken in Bu@@ l@@ gar@@ ia — when communi@@ sm col@@ lap@@ sed all over E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Europ@@ e , it wasn &apos;t just communi@@ sm ; it was the state that col@@ lap@@ sed as well ."
That means your poli@@ ce force wasn &apos;t working .
The cour@@ t system wasn &apos;t fun@@ cti@@ on@@ ing pro@@ per@@ ly .
So what was a business man in the bra@@ ve new world of E@@ ast Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an ca@@ pit@@ ali@@ sm going to do to make sure that his con@@ trac@@ ts would be hon@@ o@@ red ?
"Well , he would turn to people who were called , rather pro@@ sa@@ i@@ cally by so@@ ci@@ ologi@@ sts , pri@@ v@@ ati@@ zed la@@ w en@@ for@@ c@@ ement ag@@ en@@ cies ."
We pre@@ f@@ er to know them as the ma@@ fi@@ a .
"And in Bu@@ l@@ gar@@ ia , the ma@@ fi@@ a was so@@ on jo@@ ined with 1@@ 4@@ ,000 people who were s@@ ac@@ ked from their j@@ ob@@ s in the secu@@ ri@@ ty ser@@ vi@@ ces between 19@@ 8@@ 9 and 199@@ 1 ."
"Now , when your state is col@@ lap@@ sing , your econom@@ y is he@@ ading s@@ outh at a r@@ ate of k@@ n@@ ots , the last people you want coming on to the lab@@ or market are 1@@ 4@@ ,000 men and women wh@@ ose ch@@ ie@@ f sk@@ il@@ ls are sur@@ ve@@ il@@ l@@ ance , are s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ing , building under@@ ground net@@ works and kil@@ ling people ."
But that &apos;s what happened all over E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Europ@@ e .
"Now , when I was working in the 199@@ 0s , I spent most of the time co@@ ver@@ ing the app@@ al@@ ling con@@ fli@@ ct in Y@@ u@@ go@@ s@@ la@@ vi@@ a ."
"And I couldn &apos;t help noti@@ ce that the people who were per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ating the app@@ al@@ ling at@@ ro@@ cities , the par@@ ami@@ lit@@ ary organiz@@ ations , were actually the same people ru@@ n@@ ning the organiz@@ ed cri@@ min@@ al syn@@ di@@ c@@ ates ."
And I came to think that behind the violence l@@ ay a sin@@ ist@@ er cri@@ min@@ al en@@ ter@@ pri@@ se .
"And so I re@@ sol@@ ved to tra@@ vel around the world exam@@ ining this global cri@@ min@@ al under@@ world by talking to poli@@ c@@ em@@ en , by talking to vi@@ cti@@ ms , by talking to con@@ sum@@ ers of il@@ lic@@ it go@@ ods and ser@@ vi@@ ces ."
"But ab@@ o@@ ve all else , by talking to the g@@ ang@@ st@@ ers themselves ."
And the B@@ al@@ k@@ ans was a f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous place to start .
"Wh@@ y ? Well of course there was the issue of la@@ w and order col@@ lap@@ sing , but also , as they say in the re@@ ta@@ il tra@@ de , it &apos;s lo@@ cation , lo@@ cation , lo@@ cation ."
And what I noti@@ ced at the beginning of my research that the B@@ al@@ k@@ ans had turned into a v@@ ast tran@@ si@@ t z@@ one for il@@ lic@@ it go@@ ods and ser@@ vi@@ ces coming from all over the world .
"H@@ er@@ o@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine , women being traf@@ fi@@ cked into pro@@ stitu@@ tion and pre@@ ci@@ ous min@@ er@@ als ."
And where were they he@@ ading ?
"The Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on , which by now was beginning to re@@ a@@ p the b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts of glob@@ aliz@@ ation , trans@@ form@@ ing it into the most af@@ flu@@ ent con@@ sum@@ er market in history , ev@@ en@@ tually comp@@ ri@@ sing some 500 million people ."
"And a sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant min@@ ori@@ ty of those 500 million people like to spend some of their le@@ i@@ sure time and sp@@ are c@@ as@@ h sle@@ e@@ ping with pro@@ stitu@@ tes , sti@@ c@@ king 50 E@@ ur@@ o not@@ es up their no@@ se and em@@ plo@@ ying il@@ leg@@ al mi@@ gr@@ ant labor@@ ers ."
"Now , organiz@@ ed cri@@ me in a glob@@ aliz@@ ing world oper@@ ates in the same way as any other business ."
"It has z@@ ones of produ@@ ction , like Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan and Col@@ um@@ bi@@ a ."
"It has z@@ ones of di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion , like M@@ exi@@ co and the B@@ al@@ k@@ ans ."
"And then , of course , it has z@@ ones of con@@ sum@@ ption , like the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on , J@@ ap@@ an and of course , the United States ."
"The z@@ ones of produ@@ ction and di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion ten@@ d to lie in the develo@@ ping world , and they are often thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by app@@ al@@ ling violence and blo@@ od@@ shed ."
"T@@ ake M@@ exi@@ co , for example ."
S@@ i@@ x thous@@ and people kil@@ led there in the last 18 months as a dire@@ ct con@@ sequ@@ ence of the co@@ ca@@ ine tra@@ de .
But what about the De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic Re@@ public of Con@@ go ?
"S@@ in@@ ce 199@@ 8 , five million people have d@@ ied there ."
"It &apos;s not a con@@ fli@@ ct you read about much in the ne@@ wsp@@ a@@ per@@ s , but it &apos;s the bi@@ ggest con@@ fli@@ ct on this planet since the S@@ econ@@ d World W@@ ar ."
And why is it ? Because ma@@ fi@@ as from all around the world co@@ oper@@ ate with local par@@ ami@@ lit@@ ar@@ ies in order to se@@ i@@ ze the sup@@ pl@@ ies of the ri@@ ch min@@ er@@ al re@@ sources of the regi@@ on .
"In the year 2@@ 000 , 80 percent of the world &apos;s col@@ t@@ an was sour@@ ced to the kil@@ ling fie@@ l@@ ds of the e@@ ast@@ er@@ n De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic Re@@ public of Con@@ go ."
"Now , col@@ t@@ an you will find in almost every mo@@ bi@@ le phone , in almost every lap@@ top and g@@ am@@ es con@@ so@@ le ."
"The Con@@ g@@ ol@@ ese war l@@ or@@ ds were sel@@ ling this stuff to the ma@@ fi@@ a in ex@@ change for we@@ apo@@ ns , and the ma@@ fi@@ a would then se@@ ll it on to W@@ est@@ er@@ n marke@@ ts ."
And it is this W@@ est@@ er@@ n de@@ si@@ re to con@@ su@@ me that is the pri@@ mar@@ y dri@@ ver of inter@@ national organiz@@ ed cri@@ me .
"Now , let me show you some of my friends in action , ca@@ u@@ ght con@@ ven@@ ien@@ tly on film by the I@@ t@@ ali@@ an poli@@ ce , and s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ing du@@ ty@@ -@@ not@@ -@@ pa@@ id ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes ."
"Now , ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes out the fac@@ t@@ ory g@@ ate are very che@@ a@@ p ."
The Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on then im@@ pos@@ es the high@@ est ta@@ x@@ es on them in the world .
"So if you can s@@ mu@@ gg@@ le them into the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , there are very hand@@ some pro@@ fi@@ ts to be made , and I want to show you this to de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate the ty@@ pe of re@@ sources available to these grou@@ ps ."
This boat is wor@@ th one million Eu@@ ro@@ s when it &apos;s new .
And it &apos;s the f@@ ast@@ est thing on Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an wat@@ ers .
"F@@ ro@@ m 199@@ 4 , for seven years , 20 of these bo@@ ats made the tri@@ p across the A@@ dri@@ atic , from M@@ on@@ ten@@ e@@ gr@@ o to I@@ tal@@ y , every single night ."
"And as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of this tra@@ de , Bri@@ tain alone lost eight billion dollars in re@@ ven@@ ue ."
And instead that money went to under@@ write the war@@ s in Y@@ u@@ go@@ s@@ la@@ vi@@ a and line the po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts of un@@ sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous individu@@ als .
"Now I@@ t@@ ali@@ an poli@@ ce , when this tra@@ de started , had just two bo@@ ats which could go at the same speed ."
"And this is very important , because the only way you can cat@@ ch these guys is if they run out of gas ."
"S@@ ome@@ times the g@@ ang@@ st@@ ers would bring with them women being traf@@ fi@@ cked into pro@@ stitu@@ tion , and if the poli@@ ce inter@@ ven@@ ed , they would h@@ ur@@ l the women into the se@@ a so that the poli@@ ce had to go and sa@@ ve them from d@@ row@@ ning , rather than ch@@ as@@ ing the bad guys ."
"So I have sh@@ own you this to de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate how many bo@@ ats , how many v@@ es@@ sel@@ s it takes to cat@@ ch one of these guys ."
And the answer is six v@@ es@@ sel@@ s .
"And remember , 20 of these speed bo@@ ats were coming across the A@@ dri@@ atic every single night ."
So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making ?
"Well , this is where we come to glob@@ aliz@@ ation , because that was not just the der@@ e@@ gu@@ l@@ ation of global tra@@ de ."
It was the li@@ ber@@ aliz@@ ation of inter@@ national fin@@ an@@ cial marke@@ ts .
"And bo@@ y , did that make it e@@ asy for the money la@@ under@@ ers ."
The last two de@@ ca@@ des have been the ch@@ am@@ p@@ ag@@ ne era for di@@ r@@ ty lu@@ c@@ re .
"In the 199@@ 0s , we saw fin@@ an@@ cial cen@@ ters around the world compe@@ ting for their business , and there was simply no effe@@ ctive mechani@@ sm to pre@@ v@@ ent money la@@ under@@ ing ."
And a lot of lic@@ it ban@@ ks were also happy to ac@@ cept de@@ pos@@ its from very du@@ bi@@ ous sources without questions being asked .
"But at the heart of this , is the of@@ f@@ sh@@ ore ban@@ king network ."
"Now these things are an essen@@ tial part of the money la@@ under@@ ing par@@ ade , and if you want to do something about il@@ leg@@ al ta@@ x ev@@ a@@ sion and trans@@ national organiz@@ ed cri@@ me , money la@@ under@@ ing , you have to get ri@@ d of them ."
"O@@ n a posi@@ tive not@@ e , we at last have someone in the W@@ hi@@ te H@@ ou@@ se who has consi@@ st@@ ently spo@@ k@@ en out against these cor@@ ro@@ sive enti@@ ties ."
"And if any@@ one is con@@ cer@@ ned about what I believe is the ne@@ ces@@ sity for new le@@ gi@@ sl@@ ation , regu@@ l@@ ation , effe@@ ctive regu@@ l@@ ation , I say , let &apos;s take a look at B@@ er@@ nie M@@ ad@@ off , who is now going to be sp@@ ending the rest of his life in ja@@ il ."
B@@ er@@ nie M@@ ad@@ off sto@@ le 6@@ 5 billion dollars .
"That pu@@ ts him up there on the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pu@@ s of g@@ ang@@ st@@ ers with the Col@@ om@@ bi@@ an car@@ te@@ ls and the major R@@ us@@ si@@ an cri@@ me syn@@ di@@ c@@ ates , but he did this for de@@ ca@@ des in the very heart of W@@ all St@@ re@@ et , and no regu@@ lat@@ or pi@@ cked up on it ."
"So how many other M@@ ad@@ of@@ f@@ s are there on W@@ all St@@ re@@ et or in the city of Lon@@ don , f@@ le@@ e@@ cing ordin@@ ary fol@@ k and money la@@ under@@ ing ?"
"Well I can tell you , it &apos;s quite a few of them ."
Let me go on to the 10@@ 1 of inter@@ national organiz@@ ed cri@@ me now .
And that is nar@@ c@@ oti@@ cs . O@@ ur second mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana far@@ m photogra@@ ph for the morning .
"This one , h@@ ow@@ ever , is in cent@@ ral Bri@@ ti@@ sh Col@@ um@@ bi@@ a where I photograph@@ ed it ."
It &apos;s one of the ten@@ s of thousands of mom@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ po@@ p grow@@ -@@ op@@ s in B@@ .@@ C@@ .
which en@@ sure that over five percent of the pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce &apos;s G@@ D@@ P is ac@@ coun@@ ted for by this tra@@ de .
"Now , I was taken by in@@ spe@@ ctor Bri@@ an C@@ an@@ ter@@ a , of the Ro@@ y@@ al C@@ an@@ ad@@ i@@ an M@@ oun@@ ted Po@@ li@@ ce , to a ca@@ ver@@ n@@ ous war@@ e@@ house e@@ ast of V@@ an@@ cou@@ ver to see some of the go@@ ods which are regu@@ lar@@ ly con@@ fi@@ sc@@ ated by the R@@ C@@ M@@ P from the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers who are sen@@ ding it , of course , down s@@ outh to the United States where there is an in@@ s@@ ati@@ able market for B@@ .@@ C@@ . Bu@@ d , as it &apos;s called , in part because it &apos;s marke@@ ted as organi@@ c , which of course goes down very well in C@@ alifor@@ nia ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , even by the poli@@ ce &apos;s ad@@ mis@@ sion , this makes not a dent in the pro@@ fi@@ ts , really , of the major ex@@ por@@ ters ."
"S@@ in@@ ce the beginning of glob@@ aliz@@ ation , the global nar@@ c@@ oti@@ cs market has ex@@ pan@@ ded en@@ or@@ m@@ ously ."
"There has , h@@ ow@@ ever , been no con@@ com@@ it@@ ant incre@@ ase in the re@@ sources available to poli@@ ce for@@ ces ."
"This , h@@ ow@@ ever , may all be about to change , because something very str@@ ange is going on ."
The United N@@ ations re@@ cogni@@ zed ear@@ lie@@ r this — it was last mon@@ th actually — that C@@ an@@ ada has become a key area of di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion and produ@@ ction of e@@ c@@ st@@ asy and other syn@@ the@@ tic dru@@ gs .
"In@@ ter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , the market share of her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine is going down , because the pi@@ l@@ ls are getting ever better at re@@ produ@@ cing their high@@ s ."
"Now that is a g@@ ame chang@@ er , because it shi@@ f@@ ts produ@@ ction away from the develo@@ ping world and into the W@@ est@@ er@@ n world ."
"When that happens , it is a tr@@ end which is set to over@@ wh@@ el@@ m our poli@@ cing ca@@ pac@@ ity in the W@@ est ."
"The dru@@ gs poli@@ cy which we &apos;ve had in place for 40 years is long over@@ du@@ e for a very seri@@ ous re@@ think , in my op@@ ini@@ on ."
"Now , the re@@ ces@@ sion ."
"Well , organiz@@ ed cri@@ me has already ad@@ ap@@ ted very well to the re@@ ces@@ sion ."
"N@@ ot sur@@ pri@@ sing , the most opportuni@@ stic indu@@ stry in the whole world ."
And it has no ru@@ les to its regu@@ lat@@ ory system .
"E@@ x@@ cept , of course , it has two business ri@@ sk@@ s : ar@@ rest by la@@ w en@@ for@@ c@@ ement , which is , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , the least of their wor@@ r@@ ies , and compe@@ ti@@ tion from other grou@@ ps , i@@ .@@ e@@ . a bu@@ l@@ let in the back of the head ."
What they &apos;ve done is they &apos;ve shi@@ f@@ ted their oper@@ ations .
"P@@ e@@ ople don &apos;t smo@@ ke as much dop@@ e , or visi@@ t pro@@ stitu@@ tes quite so fre@@ qu@@ ently during a re@@ ces@@ sion ."
"And so instead , they have inv@@ ad@@ ed fin@@ an@@ cial and cor@@ por@@ ate cri@@ me in a big way , but ab@@ o@@ ve all , two se@@ ct@@ ors , and that is coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ it go@@ ods and cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me ."
And it &apos;s been terri@@ bly suc@@ cess@@ ful .
I would like to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to M@@ r. P@@ r@@ ing@@ le .
"O@@ r per@@ haps I should say , more ac@@ cur@@ ately , Se@@ ñ@@ or P@@ r@@ ing@@ le ."
I was in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced to this bit of k@@ it by a B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ an cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ min@@ al .
"We s@@ at in a car on the A@@ ven@@ ue P@@ au@@ list@@ a in S@@ ã@@ o P@@ au@@ l@@ o , together ."
"H@@ o@@ o@@ ked it up to my lap@@ top , and within about five minutes he had pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ated the computer secu@@ ri@@ ty system of a major B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ an b@@ ank ."
It &apos;s really not that difficult .
And it &apos;s actually much e@@ as@@ ier because the fas@@ cin@@ ating thing about cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me is that it &apos;s not so much the technology .
The key to cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me is what we call social engine@@ ering .
"O@@ r to use the techni@@ cal ter@@ m for it , there &apos;s one born every minu@@ te ."
You would not believe how e@@ asy it is to per@@ su@@ ade people to do things with their compu@@ ters which are obje@@ cti@@ vely not in their inter@@ est .
"And it was very so@@ on when the cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ min@@ als learned that the quick@@ est way to do this , of course , the quick@@ est way to a person &apos;s wal@@ let is through the pro@@ mi@@ se of se@@ x and love ."
"I expe@@ ct some of you remember the I@@ L@@ O@@ V@@ E@@ Y@@ O@@ U vi@@ ru@@ s , one of the very great wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de vi@@ rus@@ es that came ."
"I was very for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate when the I@@ L@@ O@@ V@@ E@@ Y@@ O@@ U vi@@ ru@@ s came out , because the first person I re@@ cei@@ ved it from was an ex@@ -@@ gir@@ l@@ friend of m@@ ine ."
"Now , she har@@ bo@@ red all sor@@ ts of sen@@ ti@@ ments and emoti@@ ons towar@@ ds me at the time , but love was not am@@ on@@ g@@ st them ."
"( Laughter ) And so as so@@ on as I saw this dro@@ p into my in@@ box , I disp@@ at@@ ched it ha@@ sti@@ ly to the re@@ cy@@ cle b@@ in and sp@@ ared myself a very na@@ sty in@@ fe@@ ction ."
"So , cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me , do wat@@ ch out for it ."
One thing that we do know that the Inter@@ net is doing is the Inter@@ net is as@@ si@@ st@@ ing these guys .
These are mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to@@ s who car@@ ry the mal@@ ari@@ al par@@ a@@ site which in@@ fe@@ sts our blo@@ od when the mo@@ sy has had a f@@ ree me@@ al at our ex@@ pen@@ se .
"Now , Ar@@ te@@ su@@ n@@ ate is a very effe@@ ctive dru@@ g at de@@ stro@@ ying the par@@ a@@ site in the early days of in@@ fe@@ ction ."
"But over the past year or so , resear@@ ch@@ ers in C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia have disco@@ vered that what &apos;s happening is the mal@@ ari@@ al par@@ a@@ site is develo@@ ping a resi@@ stance ."
"And they fe@@ ar that the reason why it &apos;s develo@@ ping a resi@@ stance is because C@@ am@@ bod@@ i@@ ans can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d the dru@@ gs on the comm@@ er@@ cial market , and so they bu@@ y it from the Inter@@ net ."
And these pi@@ l@@ ls con@@ tain only low do@@ ses of the ac@@ tive in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ t .
Wh@@ ich is why the par@@ a@@ site is beginning to develo@@ p a resi@@ stance .
The reason I say this is because we have to know that organiz@@ ed cri@@ me impac@@ ts all sor@@ ts of are@@ as of our lives .
You don &apos;t have to sle@@ ep with pro@@ stitu@@ tes or take dru@@ gs in order to have a relation@@ ship with organiz@@ ed cri@@ me .
They af@@ fe@@ ct our b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts .
"They af@@ fe@@ ct our communi@@ c@@ ations , our pen@@ sion fun@@ ds ."
They even af@@ fe@@ ct the food that we e@@ at and our govern@@ ments .
This is no longer an issue of S@@ i@@ ci@@ li@@ ans from P@@ al@@ er@@ mo and New York .
There is no ro@@ m@@ ance inv@@ olved with g@@ ang@@ st@@ ers in the 2@@ 1@@ st C@@ en@@ tury .
"This is a mi@@ gh@@ ty indu@@ stry , and it cre@@ ates in@@ st@@ ability and violence wh@@ er@@ ever it goes ."
"It is a major economic force and we need to take it very , very seri@@ ously ."
It &apos;s been a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge talking to you .

S@@ cien@@ ti@@ sts tell us that the world is war@@ ming .
S@@ cien@@ ti@@ sts tell us that vac@@ cin@@ es are sa@@ fe .
But how do we know if they are right ?
Why should be believe the science ?
"The fact is , many of us actually don &apos;t believe the science ."
"P@@ u@@ bli@@ c op@@ ini@@ on pol@@ ls consi@@ st@@ ently show that sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant pro@@ por@@ tions of the American people don &apos;t believe the clim@@ ate is war@@ ming du@@ e to human acti@@ vi@@ ties , don &apos;t think that there is ev@@ olution by natural se@@ le@@ ction , and ar@@ en &apos;t per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed by the sa@@ fe@@ ty of vac@@ cin@@ es ."
So why should we believe the science ?
"Well , scienti@@ sts don &apos;t like talking about science as a matter of belie@@ f ."
"In fact , they would con@@ tra@@ st science with fai@@ th , and they would say belie@@ f is the dom@@ a@@ in of fai@@ th ."
And fai@@ th is a se@@ par@@ ate thing a@@ part and di@@ st@@ in@@ ct from science .
In@@ de@@ ed they would say religi@@ on is based on fai@@ th or maybe the cal@@ cu@@ lu@@ s of P@@ as@@ cal &apos;s wa@@ ger .
Ma@@ ybe a few hours on S@@ un@@ day .
"( Laughter ) But if he does exi@@ st and I don &apos;t believe in him , then I &apos;m in de@@ ep t@@ rou@@ ble ."
"And so P@@ as@@ cal said , we &apos;d better believe in God ."
"O@@ r as one of my colle@@ ge prof@@ es@@ sor@@ s said , &quot; He clu@@ t@@ ched for the hand@@ ra@@ il of fai@@ th . &quot;"
He made that lea@@ p of fai@@ th lea@@ ving science and r@@ ati@@ on@@ ali@@ sm behind .
"Now the fact is though , for most of us , most scienti@@ fic c@@ la@@ im@@ s are a lea@@ p of fai@@ th ."
We can &apos;t really ju@@ dge scienti@@ fic c@@ la@@ im@@ s for ourselves in most c@@ ases .
And in@@ de@@ ed this is actually true for most scienti@@ sts as well outside of their own speci@@ al@@ ties .
Mo@@ st chemi@@ sts are not exper@@ ts in ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary the@@ ory .
"A physi@@ ci@@ st cannot tell you , des@@ pi@@ te the c@@ la@@ im@@ s of some of them , whether or not t@@ ob@@ ac@@ co ca@@ uses can@@ cer ."
Why do they believe each other &apos;s c@@ la@@ im@@ s ?
And should we believe those c@@ la@@ im@@ s ?
"So what I &apos;d like to ar@@ gu@@ e is y@@ es , we should , but not for the reason that most of us think ."
Mo@@ st of us were t@@ au@@ ght in school that the reason we should believe in science is because of the scienti@@ fic meth@@ od .
"The meth@@ od that most of us were t@@ au@@ ght in school , we can call it the te@@ x@@ t@@ book meth@@ od , is the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical de@@ du@@ ctive meth@@ od ."
C@@ an we obser@@ ve them taking place in the natural world ?
"And if they are true , then the scienti@@ sts say , &quot; Gre@@ at , we know the hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis is cor@@ re@@ ct . &quot;"
One of the most fam@@ ous exam@@ ples comes from the work of Al@@ ber@@ t E@@ inste@@ in .
"When E@@ inste@@ in develo@@ ped the the@@ ory of gener@@ al relati@@ vity , one of the con@@ sequ@@ ences of his the@@ ory was that sp@@ ace@@ -@@ time wasn &apos;t just an em@@ p@@ ty vo@@ id but that it actually had a f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c ."
And that that f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c was b@@ ent in the pre@@ sen@@ ce of mas@@ sive obje@@ cts like the su@@ n .
St@@ ar@@ light actually does b@@ end as it tra@@ v@@ els around the su@@ n .
This was a huge con@@ fir@@ m@@ ation of the the@@ ory .
"But also because in the ide@@ al case , it &apos;s about l@@ aw@@ s ."
So n@@ om@@ ologi@@ cal means having to do with l@@ aw@@ s .
"And in the ide@@ al case , the hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis isn &apos;t just an idea : ide@@ ally , it is a la@@ w of nature ."
Why does it matter that it is a la@@ w of nature ?
"Because if it is a la@@ w , it can &apos;t be bro@@ k@@ en ."
If it &apos;s a la@@ w then it will always be true in all times and all places no matter what the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces are .
"And all of you know of at least one example of a fam@@ ous la@@ w : E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s fam@@ ous equ@@ ation , E = M@@ C@@ 2 , which tel@@ ls us what the relation@@ ship is between energy and mas@@ s ."
And that relation@@ ship is true no matter what .
"Now , it turns out , though , that there are se@@ ver@@ al problems with this model ."
The ma@@ in problem is that it &apos;s wrong .
It &apos;s just not true . ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to talk about three reas@@ ons why it &apos;s wrong .
So the first reason is a logi@@ cal reason .
It &apos;s the problem of the fal@@ l@@ acy of af@@ fir@@ ming the con@@ sequ@@ ent .
"So that &apos;s another fan@@ cy , ac@@ a@@ demi@@ c way of saying that fal@@ se the@@ or@@ ies can make true pre@@ di@@ ctions ."
"And I have a good example of that too , again from the history of science ."
This is a picture of the P@@ to@@ le@@ ma@@ ic universe with the Earth at the cen@@ ter of the universe and the su@@ n and the plane@@ ts going around it .
The P@@ to@@ le@@ ma@@ ic model was belie@@ ved by many very s@@ mar@@ t people for many cen@@ tur@@ ies .
"Well , why ?"
Well the answer is because it made lots of pre@@ di@@ ctions that came true .
"The P@@ to@@ le@@ ma@@ ic system en@@ ab@@ led ast@@ ron@@ om@@ ers to make ac@@ cur@@ ate pre@@ di@@ ctions of the moti@@ ons of the planet , in fact more ac@@ cur@@ ate pre@@ di@@ ctions at first than the C@@ oper@@ ni@@ can the@@ ory which we now would say is true ."
So that &apos;s one problem with the te@@ x@@ t@@ book model .
"A second problem is a prac@@ tical problem , and it &apos;s the problem of au@@ x@@ i@@ li@@ ary hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es ."
Au@@ x@@ i@@ li@@ ary hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es are as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions that scienti@@ sts are making that they may or may not even be aw@@ are that they &apos;re making .
"So an important example of this comes from the C@@ oper@@ ni@@ can model , which ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely re@@ plac@@ ed the P@@ to@@ le@@ ma@@ ic system ."
"So when Ni@@ col@@ au@@ s C@@ oper@@ ni@@ cus said , actually the Earth is not the cen@@ ter of the universe , the su@@ n is the cen@@ ter of the solar system , the Earth mo@@ ves around the su@@ n ."
"S@@ cien@@ ti@@ sts said , well o@@ kay , Ni@@ col@@ au@@ s , if that &apos;s true we ou@@ ght to be able to de@@ te@@ ct the moti@@ on of the Earth around the su@@ n ."
And so this sli@@ de here il@@ lu@@ str@@ ates a con@@ cept known as st@@ el@@ lar par@@ al@@ la@@ x .
"If we now make the same obser@@ vation six months later when the Earth has mo@@ ved to this posi@@ tion in Ju@@ ne , we look at that same st@@ ar and we see it against a different back@@ dro@@ p ."
"That difference , that ang@@ ul@@ ar difference , is the st@@ el@@ lar par@@ al@@ la@@ x ."
So this is a pre@@ di@@ ction that the C@@ oper@@ ni@@ can model makes .
"A@@ stron@@ om@@ ers looked for the st@@ el@@ lar par@@ al@@ la@@ x and they found nothing , nothing at all ."
And many people ar@@ gu@@ ed that this pro@@ ved that the C@@ oper@@ ni@@ can model was fal@@ se .
So what happened ?
The first was an as@@ sum@@ ption about the size of the Earth &apos;s or@@ bit .
A@@ stron@@ om@@ ers were as@@ sum@@ ing that the Earth &apos;s or@@ bit was large rel@@ ative to the di@@ stance to the star@@ s .
"T@@ od@@ ay we would dra@@ w the picture more like this , this comes from N@@ A@@ SA , and you see the Earth &apos;s or@@ bit is actually quite small ."
"In fact , it &apos;s actually much s@@ mal@@ ler even than sh@@ own here ."
"The st@@ el@@ lar par@@ al@@ la@@ x ther@@ e@@ fore , is very small and actually very hard to de@@ te@@ ct ."
And that turned out not to be true .
"So , there &apos;s a third problem as well ."
"The third problem is simply a fac@@ tu@@ al problem , that a lot of science doesn &apos;t f@@ it the te@@ x@@ t@@ book model ."
"A lot of science isn &apos;t de@@ du@@ ctive at all , it &apos;s actually indu@@ ctive ."
"When D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n went out as a young man on the vo@@ y@@ age of the Be@@ ag@@ le , he didn &apos;t have a hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis , he didn &apos;t have a the@@ ory ."
He just knew that he wanted to have a car@@ e@@ er as a scienti@@ st and he started to colle@@ ct data .
So he started colle@@ cting data .
"And he colle@@ cted many things , inclu@@ ding his fam@@ ous fin@@ ch@@ es ."
"Be@@ si@@ des indu@@ ctive science , scienti@@ sts also often parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in mode@@ ling ."
And how do we do that ?
"So this is a picture of H@@ en@@ ry C@@ a@@ de@@ ll , who was a S@@ c@@ ot@@ ti@@ sh ge@@ ologi@@ st in the 19@@ th century ."
And this idea would later play a major ro@@ le in di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions of contin@@ ent@@ al dri@@ ft .
"So he built this model , this c@@ razy con@@ tra@@ ption with le@@ ver@@ s and wood , and here &apos;s his whe@@ el@@ bar@@ row , bu@@ c@@ ke@@ ts , a big sle@@ d@@ ge@@ ha@@ m@@ m@@ er ."
I don &apos;t know why he &apos;s got the W@@ el@@ lin@@ g@@ ton bo@@ ots .
Ma@@ ybe it &apos;s going to ra@@ in .
"And he created this physi@@ cal model in order to de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that you could , in fact , create pat@@ ter@@ ns in ro@@ cks , or at least , in this case , in mu@@ d , that looked a lot like m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins if you com@@ pres@@ sed them from the side ."
"N@@ ow@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , most scienti@@ sts pre@@ f@@ er to work inside , so they don &apos;t build physi@@ cal mode@@ ls so much as to make computer si@@ mul@@ ations ."
But a computer si@@ mul@@ ation is a kind of a model .
"It &apos;s a model that &apos;s made with ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs , and like the physi@@ cal mode@@ ls of the 19@@ th century , it &apos;s very important for thinking about ca@@ uses ."
"So one of the big questions to do with clim@@ ate change , we have tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous amoun@@ ts of evi@@ dence that the Earth is war@@ ming up ."
"So what , though , is dri@@ ving that change ?"
"So this di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m il@@ lu@@ str@@ ates a computer si@@ mul@@ ation that has looked at all the different fac@@ t@@ ors that we know can in@@ flu@@ ence the Earth &apos;s clim@@ ate , so sul@@ f@@ ate parti@@ cles from air pol@@ lu@@ tion , vol@@ c@@ ani@@ c d@@ ust from vol@@ c@@ ani@@ c er@@ up@@ tions , chang@@ es in solar radi@@ ation , and , of course , gre@@ en@@ house g@@ ases ."
"And they asked the question , what set of v@@ ari@@ ab@@ les put into a model will re@@ produ@@ ce what we actually see in real life ?"
So here is the real life in black .
S@@ cien@@ ti@@ sts are cre@@ ative .
And who ju@@ d@@ ges ?
"And the answer is , scienti@@ sts ju@@ dge , and they ju@@ dge by ju@@ d@@ g@@ ing evi@@ dence ."
"S@@ cien@@ ti@@ sts colle@@ ct evi@@ dence in many different ways , but h@@ ow@@ ever they colle@@ ct it , they have to sub@@ je@@ ct it to sc@@ ru@@ t@@ iny ."
"And in this sense , science is in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ cally con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative ."
"We can also think of science as being a kind of a j@@ ury , ex@@ cept it &apos;s a very spe@@ cial kind of j@@ ury ."
"It &apos;s not a j@@ ury of your pe@@ ers , it &apos;s a j@@ ury of ge@@ e@@ ks ."
"S@@ cien@@ ti@@ sts can say y@@ es , something &apos;s true ."
"S@@ cien@@ ti@@ sts can say no , it &apos;s fal@@ se ."
"O@@ r , they can say , well it might be true but we need to work more and colle@@ ct more evi@@ dence ."
"Well , here &apos;s the par@@ ad@@ o@@ x of moder@@ n science , the par@@ ad@@ o@@ x of the con@@ clu@@ sion I think histori@@ ans and phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ ers and so@@ ci@@ ologi@@ sts have come to , that actually science is the ap@@ pe@@ al to au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty , but it &apos;s not the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty of the individu@@ al , no matter how s@@ mar@@ t that individu@@ al is , like P@@ la@@ to or S@@ oc@@ r@@ ates or E@@ inste@@ in ."
It &apos;s the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty of the colle@@ ctive community .
"You can think of it is a kind of wi@@ s@@ dom of the c@@ row@@ d , but a very spe@@ cial kind of c@@ row@@ d ."
"S@@ cien@@ ce does ap@@ pe@@ al to au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty , but it &apos;s not based on any individu@@ al , no matter how s@@ mar@@ t that individu@@ al may be ."
"It &apos;s based on the colle@@ ctive wi@@ s@@ dom , the colle@@ ctive know@@ le@@ dge , the colle@@ ctive work , of all of the scienti@@ sts who have worked on a particular problem ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ kay , so that br@@ ings me to my fin@@ al point ."
Mo@@ st of us get up in the morning .
Mo@@ st of us tr@@ ust our cars .
The moder@@ n au@@ tom@@ ob@@ ile har@@ d@@ ly ever bre@@ ak@@ s down .
So why is that ? Why do cars work so well ?
It &apos;s not because of the g@@ eni@@ us of H@@ en@@ ry F@@ or@@ d or K@@ ar@@ l B@@ en@@ z or even E@@ l@@ on M@@ us@@ k .
We b@@ en@@ ef@@ it not just from the g@@ eni@@ us of B@@ en@@ z and F@@ or@@ d and M@@ us@@ k but from the colle@@ ctive inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence and hard work of all of the people who have worked on the moder@@ n car .
"And the same is true of science , only science is even ol@@ der ."
"O@@ ur basi@@ s for tr@@ ust in science is actually the same as our basi@@ s in tr@@ ust in technology , and the same as our basi@@ s for tr@@ ust in anything , na@@ me@@ ly , experience ."
But it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be bl@@ ind tr@@ ust any more than we would have bl@@ ind tr@@ ust in anything .
"They have to expla@@ in to us not just what they know but how they know it , and it means that we have to become better list@@ en@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
We gre@@ w up inter@@ ac@@ ting with the physi@@ cal obje@@ cts around us .
There are an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous number of them that we use every day .
"We use g@@ est@@ ures not only to inter@@ act with these obje@@ cts , but we also use them to inter@@ act with each other ."
It comes as a part of our every@@ day lear@@ ning .
"R@@ a@@ ther than using a ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard and m@@ ou@@ se , why can I not use my computer in the same way that I inter@@ act in the physi@@ cal world ?"
"So , I started this expl@@ or@@ ation around eight years back , and it liter@@ ally started with a m@@ ou@@ se on my des@@ k ."
"R@@ a@@ ther than using it for my computer , I actually open@@ ed it ."
"In@@ ter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , what I did with these rol@@ l@@ ers is , basically , I took them off of these m@@ ous@@ es and then put them in one line ."
It had some str@@ ings and pul@@ le@@ ys and some sp@@ r@@ ings .
What I got is basically a g@@ est@@ u@@ re@@ -@@ inter@@ face de@@ vice that actually ac@@ ts as a moti@@ on-@@ sen@@ sing de@@ vice made for two dollars .
"But you can also sear@@ ch in the di@@ gi@@ tal world , or maybe you can write a qu@@ ery , saying , &quot; What is D@@ r. S@@ mi@@ th &apos;s ad@@ dre@@ ss ? &quot;"
"In another expl@@ or@@ ation , I thought of making a p@@ en that can dra@@ w in three di@@ men@@ sions ."
"So , I im@@ ple@@ men@@ ted this p@@ en that can help desig@@ n@@ ers and archite@@ cts not only think in three di@@ men@@ sions , but they can actually dra@@ w , so that it &apos;s more in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive to use that way ."
"If I put a bo@@ ar@@ ding pas@@ s , it will show me where the f@@ light g@@ ate is ."
"So , these were some of the ear@@ lie@@ r expl@@ or@@ ations I did because the go@@ al was to conne@@ ct these two wor@@ l@@ ds se@@ am@@ l@@ ess@@ ly ."
What we are interested in is information .
We want to know about things .
We want to know about dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c things going around .
"I think that &apos;s why this is called a he@@ ad@@ -@@ m@@ oun@@ ted proje@@ ctor , isn &apos;t it ?"
But the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can car@@ ry your di@@ gi@@ tal world with you wh@@ er@@ ever you go .
"You can start using any surface , any w@@ all around you , as an inter@@ face ."
The cam@@ era is actually trac@@ king all your g@@ est@@ ures .
"Wh@@ atever you &apos;re doing with your h@@ ands , it &apos;s under@@ standing that g@@ est@@ ure ."
"You stop by a w@@ all , and start pain@@ ting on that w@@ all ."
"But we are not only trac@@ king one fin@@ ger , here ."
( Applause ) Thank you .
"And , of course , if you don &apos;t have any surface , you can start using your pal@@ m for simple oper@@ ations ."
"H@@ ere , I &apos;m di@@ al@@ ing a phone number just using my hand ."
Y@@ our ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er will show you live we@@ a@@ ther information rather than having it up@@ d@@ ated .
"So , rather than wai@@ ting for that , I actually made my own , just using a piece of pa@@ per ."
"I re@@ mo@@ ved the micro@@ phone from that , and then just p@@ in@@ ched that — like I just made a cli@@ p out of the micro@@ phone — and cli@@ pped that to a piece of pa@@ per , any pa@@ per that you found around ."
So now the sound of the tou@@ ch is getting me when exactly I &apos;m tou@@ ching the pa@@ per .
But the cam@@ era is actually trac@@ king where my fin@@ g@@ ers are moving .
You can of course wat@@ ch mov@@ ies .

"When I come back to my des@@ k , I can just p@@ in@@ ch that information back to my des@@ kt@@ o@@ p so I can use my fu@@ ll@@ -@@ size computer ."
( Applause ) And why only compu@@ ters ? We can just play with pa@@ per@@ s .
P@@ ap@@ er world is interesting to play with .
"H@@ ere , I &apos;m taking a part of a do@@ cu@@ ment , and pu@@ tting over here a second part from a second place , and I &apos;m actually mo@@ dif@@ ying the information that I have over there ."
"@@ Yeah . And I say , &quot; &quot; OK , this looks nice , let me pr@@ int it out , that thing . &quot; &quot; So I now have a prin@@ t-@@ out of that thing ."
"Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : So , P@@ ran@@ a@@ v , first of all , you &apos;re a g@@ eni@@ us ."
"This is incredible , really ."
What are you doing with this ? Is there a company being plan@@ ned ?
CA : O@@ p@@ en source ? W@@ ow .
"( Applause ) CA : A@@ re you going to come back to Indi@@ a with some of this , at some point ?"
CA : What are your pl@@ ans ? M@@ I@@ T ? Indi@@ a ?
How are you going to sp@@ li@@ t your time going forward ?
All of this work that you have seen is all about my lear@@ ning in Indi@@ a .
"And now , if you see , it &apos;s more about the co@@ st@@ -@@ effe@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess : this system co@@ sts you $ 3@@ 00 com@@ par@@ ed to the $ 20@@ ,000 surface tab@@ les , or anything like that ."
"O@@ r maybe even the $ 2 m@@ ou@@ se g@@ est@@ ure system at that time was co@@ st@@ ing around $ 5@@ ,000 ?"
Thank you so much .
That &apos;s fanta@@ stic .
"W@@ al@@ k around for four months with three wi@@ sh@@ es , and all the ideas will start to per@@ col@@ ate up ."
I think everybody should do it — think that you &apos;ve got three wi@@ sh@@ es .
"And what would you do ? It &apos;s actually a great ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se to really dri@@ ll down to the things that you feel are important , and really ref@@ le@@ ct on the world around us ."
"And thinking that , can an individu@@ al actually do something , or come up with something , that may actually get some trac@@ tion out there and make a difference ?"
In@@ spi@@ red by nature — that &apos;s the the@@ me here .
"And I think , quite f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , that &apos;s where I started ."
I became very interested in the land@@ s@@ cape as a C@@ an@@ ad@@ i@@ an .
"We have this Gre@@ at Nor@@ th . And there was a pretty small popul@@ ation , and my father was an avi@@ d out@@ do@@ or@@ s@@ man ."
So I really had a ch@@ ance to experience that .
"And I could never really understand exactly what it was , or how it was inform@@ ing me ."
"But what I think it was tel@@ ling me is that we are this trans@@ ien@@ t thing that &apos;s happening , and that the nature that you see out there — the un@@ tou@@ ched sh@@ ore@@ lin@@ es , the un@@ tou@@ ched fore@@ st that I was able to see — really bring in a sense of that ge@@ ologi@@ cal time , that this has gone on for a long time , and we &apos;re exper@@ ien@@ cing it in a different way ."
"And that , to me , was a re@@ fer@@ ence point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did ."
"And I did go out , and I did this picture of gra@@ s@@ ses coming through in the sp@@ ring , along a ro@@ ad@@ side ."
This re@@ bir@@ th of gra@@ ss . And then I went out for years trying to photogra@@ ph the pri@@ st@@ ine land@@ s@@ cape .
"But as a fin@@ e-@@ art photograph@@ er I some@@ how felt that it wouldn &apos;t cat@@ ch on out there , that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fin@@ e-@@ art car@@ e@@ er ."
"And I ke@@ pt being suc@@ ked into this gen@@ re of the cal@@ en@@ d@@ ar picture , or something of that nature , and I couldn &apos;t get away from it ."
"So I started to think of , how can I re@@ think the land@@ s@@ cape ?"
I decided to re@@ think the land@@ s@@ cape as the land@@ s@@ cape that we &apos;ve trans@@ form@@ ed .
"I had a bit of an epi@@ ph@@ any being lost in P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , and I took a left turn trying to get back to the high@@ way ."
And I en@@ ded up in a tow@@ n called F@@ rac@@ k@@ vi@@ l@@ le .
"I got out of the car , and I sto@@ od up , and it was a co@@ al@@ -@@ min@@ ing tow@@ n . I did a 3@@ 60 tur@@ na@@ round , and that became one of the most sur@@ real land@@ s@@ cap@@ es I &apos;ve ever seen ."
T@@ ot@@ ally trans@@ form@@ ed by man .
"And that got me to go out and look at min@@ es like this , and go out and look at the largest indu@@ stri@@ al in@@ cur@@ sions in the land@@ s@@ cape that I could find ."
And that became the bas@@ el@@ ine of what I was doing .
"And it also became the the@@ me that I felt that I could h@@ old on@@ to , and not have to re@@ -@@ inv@@ ent myself — that this the@@ me was large enough to become a life &apos;s work , to become something that I could sin@@ k my te@@ e@@ th into and just research and find out where these indu@@ str@@ ies are ."
"And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my th@@ an@@ ks , which I kind of mis@@ sed , was to th@@ ank all the cor@@ por@@ ations who hel@@ ped me get in ."
"Because it took neg@@ oti@@ ation for almost every one of these photograph@@ s — to get into that place to make those photograph@@ s , and if it wasn &apos;t for those people le@@ tting me in at the he@@ ads of those cor@@ por@@ ations , I would have never made this body of work ."
"So in that re@@ spe@@ ct , to me , I &apos;m not against the cor@@ por@@ ation ."
"I own a cor@@ por@@ ation . I work with them , and I feel that we all need them and they &apos;re important ."
But I am also for susta@@ in@@ ability .
So there &apos;s this thing that is pul@@ ling me in both dire@@ ctions .
"And I &apos;m not making an indi@@ ct@@ ment towar@@ ds what &apos;s happening here , but it is a s@@ low pro@@ gre@@ s@@ sion ."
"So I started thinking , well , we live in all these ages of man : the St@@ one A@@ ge , and the I@@ ro@@ n A@@ ge , and the C@@ op@@ per A@@ ge ."
And these ages of man are still at work today .
But we &apos;ve become tot@@ ally dis@@ conne@@ cted from them .
There &apos;s something that we &apos;re not seeing there .
"And it &apos;s a sc@@ ary thing as well . Because when we start looking at the colle@@ ctive ap@@ pe@@ ti@@ te for our li@@ fe@@ sty@@ les , and what we &apos;re doing to that land@@ s@@ cape — that , to me , is something that is a very sob@@ ering moment for me to con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate ."
"And through my photograph@@ s , I &apos;m hop@@ ing to be able to eng@@ age the aud@@ ien@@ ces of my work , and to come up to it and not im@@ medi@@ ately be re@@ je@@ cted by the image ."
"N@@ ot to say , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , what is it ? &quot; &quot; but to be challen@@ g@@ ed by it — to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , this is beautiful , &quot; &quot; on one level , but on the other level , &quot; &quot; This is sc@@ ary . I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be en@@ jo@@ ying it . &quot; &quot; Li@@ ke a for@@ bi@@ d@@ den ple@@ as@@ ure . And it &apos;s that for@@ bi@@ d@@ den ple@@ as@@ ure that I think is what re@@ son@@ ates out there , and it gets people to look at these things , and it gets people to enter it . And it also , in a way , de@@ fin@@ es kind of what I feel , too — that I &apos;m d@@ raw@@ n to have a good life ."
"I want a house , and I want a car ."
But there &apos;s this con@@ sequ@@ ence out there .
"And how do I beg@@ in to have that at@@ trac@@ tion , re@@ pul@@ sion ?"
"It &apos;s even in my own con@@ science I &apos;m having it , and here in my work , I &apos;m trying to build that same to@@ gg@@ le ."
These things that I photograph@@ ed — this ti@@ re pi@@ le here had 4@@ 5 million ti@@ res in it . It was the largest one .
"It was only about an h@@ our@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half away from me , and it ca@@ u@@ ght fi@@ re about four years ago . It &apos;s around W@@ est@@ ley , C@@ alifor@@ nia , around Mo@@ de@@ sto ."
"And I decided to start looking at something that , to me , had — if the ear@@ lie@@ r work of looking at the land@@ s@@ cape had a sense of l@@ am@@ ent to what we were doing to nature , in the re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling work that you &apos;re seeing here was star@@ ting to point to a dire@@ ction . To me , it was our re@@ de@@ m@@ ption ."
"That in the re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling work that I was doing , I &apos;m looking for a prac@@ ti@@ ce , a human acti@@ vity that is susta@@ in@@ able ."
"That if we keep pu@@ tting things , through indu@@ stri@@ al and urb@@ an ex@@ ist@@ ence , back into the system — if we keep doing that — we can contin@@ ue on ."
"O@@ f course , list@@ ening at the con@@ fer@@ ence , there &apos;s many , many things that are coming . Bi@@ o@@ -@@ mi@@ mi@@ c@@ ry , and there &apos;s many other things that are coming on stre@@ am — n@@ an@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy that may also pre@@ v@@ ent us from having to go into that land@@ s@@ cape and te@@ ar it a@@ part ."
And we all look forward to those things .
"But in the me@@ an@@ time , these things are sc@@ al@@ ing up ."
These things are contin@@ u@@ ing to happen .
"What you &apos;re looking at here — I went to B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h , so I started to move away from Nor@@ th America ; I started to look at our world glob@@ ally ."
These images of B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h came out of a radi@@ o program I was list@@ ening to .
"They were talking about E@@ x@@ x@@ on V@@ al@@ de@@ z , and that there was going to be a g@@ lu@@ t of oil tan@@ k@@ ers because of the in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce indu@@ str@@ ies ."
"And that those oil tan@@ k@@ ers needed to be de@@ com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed , and 200@@ 4 was going to be the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le ."
"And I thought , &quot; &quot; My God , wouldn &apos;t that be something ? &quot; &quot; To see the largest v@@ es@@ sel@@ s of man being de@@ con@@ stru@@ cted by hand , liter@@ ally , in th@@ ir@@ d-@@ world countries ."
So ori@@ gin@@ ally I was going to go to Indi@@ a .
"And I was sh@@ u@@ t out of Indi@@ a because of a Gre@@ en@@ pe@@ ace situ@@ ation there , and then I was able to get into B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h , and saw for the first time a third world , a view of it , that I had never actually thought was possible ."
"@@ 1@@ 30 million people living in an area the size of W@@ is@@ consi@@ n — people every@@ where — the pol@@ lu@@ tion was inten@@ se , and the working con@@ di@@ tions were hor@@ ri@@ ble ."
"H@@ ere you &apos;re looking at some oil fie@@ l@@ ds in C@@ alifor@@ nia , some of the bi@@ ggest oil fie@@ l@@ ds . And again , I started to think that — there was another epi@@ ph@@ any — that the whole world I was living in was a resul@@ t of having pl@@ enti@@ ful oil ."
"And that , to me , was again something that I started building on , and I contin@@ u@@ ed to build on ."
"So this is a ser@@ ies I &apos;m hop@@ ing to have ready in about two or three years , under the he@@ ading of &quot; &quot; The O@@ il Par@@ ty . &quot; &quot; Because I think everything that we &apos;re inv@@ olved in — our clo@@ thing , our cars , our ro@@ ads , and everything — are dire@@ ct@@ ly a resul@@ t ."
I &apos;m going to move to some pi@@ ctures of China .
"And for me China — I started photograph@@ ing it four years ago , and China tru@@ ly is a question of susta@@ in@@ ability in my mind , not to men@@ tion that China , as well , has a great effe@@ ct on the indu@@ str@@ ies that I gre@@ w up around ."
"I came out of a blu@@ e-@@ col@@ lar tow@@ n , a G@@ M tow@@ n , and my father worked at G@@ M , so I was very fami@@ li@@ ar with that kind of indu@@ stry and that also inform@@ ed my work . But you know , to see China and the scale at which it &apos;s ev@@ ol@@ ving , is quite something ."
"So what you see here is the Th@@ ree G@@ or@@ ges D@@ am , and this is the largest d@@ am by 50 percent ever at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted by man ."
"Mo@@ st of the engine@@ ers around the world left the project because they said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s just too big . &quot; &quot; In fact , when it did actually fi@@ ll with water a year and a half ago , they were able to meas@@ ure a w@@ ob@@ ble within the ear@@ th as it was sp@@ in@@ ning ."
It took fi@@ f@@ te@@ en days to fi@@ ll it .
"So this created a re@@ ser@@ vo@@ ir 6@@ 00 kilome@@ ters long , one of the largest re@@ ser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s ever created ."
"And what was also one of the bi@@ g@@ ger proje@@ cts around that was moving 1@@ 3 fu@@ ll@@ -@@ size cities up out of the re@@ ser@@ vo@@ ir , and f@@ lat@@ ten@@ ing all the buil@@ dings so they could make way for the ships ."
This is a &quot; &quot; before and after . &quot; &quot; So that was before .
"And this is like 10 weeks later , demo@@ li@@ shed by hand ."
"I think 11 of the buil@@ dings they used dy@@ na@@ mi@@ te , everything else was by hand . That was 10 weeks later ."
And this gi@@ ves you an idea .
"And it was all the people who li@@ ved in those hom@@ es , were the ones that were actually taking it a@@ part and working , and getting pa@@ id per bri@@ ck to take their cities a@@ part ."
And these are some of the images from that .
"So I spent about three tri@@ ps to the Th@@ ree G@@ or@@ ges D@@ am , looking at that mas@@ sive trans@@ form@@ ation of a land@@ s@@ cape ."
"And it looks like a b@@ om@@ be@@ d-@@ out land@@ s@@ cape , but it isn &apos;t ."
"What it is , it &apos;s a land@@ s@@ cape that is an inten@@ ti@@ onal one ."
"This is a need for power , and they &apos;re wil@@ ling to go through this mas@@ sive trans@@ form@@ ation , on this scale , to get that power ."
"And again , it &apos;s actually a re@@ lie@@ f for what &apos;s going on in China because I think on the table right now , there &apos;s 2@@ 7 nuclear power st@@ ations to be built ."
"There ha@@ sn &apos;t been one built in Nor@@ th America for 20 years because of the &quot; &quot; N@@ I@@ M@@ B@@ Y &quot; &quot; problem — &quot; &quot; N@@ ot In My B@@ ac@@ k@@ Y@@ ard . &quot; &quot; But in China they &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;re pu@@ tting in 2@@ 7 in the next 10 years . &quot; &quot; And co@@ al@@ -@@ bur@@ ning f@@ ur@@ n@@ ac@@ es are going in there for hy@@ dro@@ electri@@ c power liter@@ ally we@@ ek@@ ly ."
So co@@ al itself is probably one of the largest problems .
And one of the other things that happened in the Th@@ ree G@@ or@@ ges — a lot of the agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral land that you see there on the left was also lost ; some of the most fer@@ ti@@ le agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral land was lost in that .
"And 1@@ .@@ 2 to 2 million people were re@@ lo@@ c@@ ated , depen@@ ding on wh@@ ose st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs you &apos;re looking at ."
And this is what they were building .
"This is W@@ us@@ h@@ an , one of the largest cities that was re@@ lo@@ c@@ ated ."
This is the tow@@ n h@@ all for the city .
"And again , the re@@ building of the city — to me , it was sa@@ d to see that they didn &apos;t really gra@@ b a lot of , I gu@@ ess , what we know here , in terms of urb@@ an plan@@ ning ."
There were no par@@ ks ; there were no green sp@@ ac@@ es .
V@@ ery high-@@ den@@ sity living on the side of a hi@@ ll .
"And here they had a ch@@ ance to re@@ build cities from the bot@@ tom up , but some@@ how were not conne@@ cting with them ."
"H@@ ere is a sig@@ n that , trans@@ lated , says , &quot; &quot; O@@ be@@ y the bir@@ th control la@@ w ."
"@@ Bu@@ ild our science , ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ed and adv@@ an@@ ced idea of mar@@ ri@@ age and gi@@ ving bir@@ th . &quot; &quot; So here , if you look at this post@@ er , it has all the tra@@ pp@@ ings of W@@ est@@ er@@ n culture ."
"You &apos;re seeing the tu@@ x@@ e@@ do@@ s , the b@@ ou@@ qu@@ ets ."
"But what &apos;s really , to me , f@@ ri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing about the picture and about this bi@@ ll@@ bo@@ ard is the re@@ fin@@ ery in the back@@ ground ."
"So it &apos;s like mar@@ ry@@ ing up all the things that we have and it &apos;s an ad@@ ap@@ tation of our way of life , full stop ."
"And again , when you start seeing that kind of em@@ brac@@ e , and you start looking at them le@@ ading their ru@@ ral li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le with a very , very small fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int and moving into an urb@@ an li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le with a much high@@ er fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int , it star@@ ts to become very sob@@ ering ."
This is a sh@@ ot in one of the bi@@ ggest squ@@ ar@@ es in G@@ u@@ ang@@ d@@ ong — and this is where a lot of mi@@ gr@@ ant wor@@ k@@ ers are coming in from the country .
"And there &apos;s about 1@@ 30 million people in mi@@ gr@@ ation trying to get into urb@@ an cen@@ ters at all times , and in the next 10 to 15 years , are expe@@ cting another 4@@ 00 to 500 million people to mi@@ gr@@ ate into the urb@@ an cen@@ ters like S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i and the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing cen@@ ters ."
The man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers are — the dom@@ esti@@ cs are usu@@ ally — you can tell a dom@@ esti@@ c fac@@ t@@ ory by the fact that they all use the same color uni@@ form@@ s .
So this is a p@@ in@@ k uni@@ form at this fac@@ t@@ ory . It &apos;s a sho@@ e fac@@ t@@ ory .
And they have d@@ or@@ ms for the wor@@ k@@ ers .
So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the d@@ or@@ ms .
"This is one of the bi@@ ggest sho@@ e fac@@ tor@@ ies , the Y@@ u@@ y@@ u@@ an sho@@ e fac@@ t@@ ory ne@@ ar S@@ h@@ en@@ z@@ h@@ en . It has 9@@ 0,000 em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es making sho@@ es ."
"This is a shi@@ ft change , one of three ."
There &apos;s two fac@@ tor@@ ies of this scale in the same tow@@ n .
"This is one with 4@@ 5@@ ,000 , so every lu@@ n@@ ch , there &apos;s about 1@@ 2@@ ,000 coming through for lu@@ n@@ ch ."
They si@@ t down ; they have about 20 minutes .
"The next round comes in . It &apos;s an incredible wor@@ k@@ force that &apos;s building there . S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i — I &apos;m looking at the urb@@ an r@@ ene@@ wa@@ l in S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i , and this is a whole area that will be f@@ lat@@ ten@@ ed and turned into sk@@ y@@ sc@@ ra@@ per@@ s in the next five years ."
"What &apos;s also happening in S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i is — China is chang@@ ing because this wouldn &apos;t have happened five years ago , for in@@ stance . This is a hol@@ d@@ out ."
They &apos;re called den@@ g@@ za@@ ho@@ os — they &apos;re like p@@ in t@@ ac@@ ks to the ground .
They won &apos;t move . They &apos;re not neg@@ oti@@ ating .
"They &apos;re not getting enough , so they &apos;re not going to move ."
And so they &apos;re hol@@ ding off until they get a deal with them .
And they &apos;ve been actually quite suc@@ cess@@ ful in getting better de@@ als because most of them are getting a ra@@ w deal .
"They &apos;re being put out about two hours — the communi@@ ties that have been around for liter@@ ally hundre@@ ds of years , or maybe even thousands of years , are being bro@@ k@@ en up and sp@@ read across in the su@@ bur@@ b@@ an are@@ as outside of S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i . But these are a whole ser@@ ies of guys hol@@ ding out in this re@@ con@@ stru@@ ction of S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i ."
"P@@ rob@@ ably the largest ur@@ ban@@ -@@ r@@ ene@@ wa@@ l project , I think , ever at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted on the planet ."
"And then the em@@ brac@@ e of the things that they &apos;re re@@ plac@@ ing it with — again , one of my wi@@ sh@@ es , and I never en@@ ded up going there , was to some@@ how tell them that there were better ways to build a house ."
"The kinds of col@@ li@@ sions of sty@@ les and things were quite something , and these are called the vi@@ ll@@ as ."
"And also , like right now , they &apos;re just moving ."
"The s@@ ca@@ f@@ fol@@ ding is still on , and this is an e-@@ wa@@ ste area , and if you looked in the fore@@ ground on the big pr@@ int , you &apos;d see that the indu@@ stry — their indu@@ stry — they &apos;re all re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling ."
So the indu@@ stry &apos;s already grow@@ ing around these new develo@@ p@@ ments .
This is a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ level bri@@ dge in S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i .
S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i was a very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing city — it &apos;s ex@@ plo@@ ding on a level that I don &apos;t think any city has exper@@ ien@@ ced .
"In fact , even S@@ h@@ en@@ z@@ h@@ en , the economic z@@ one — one of the first ones — 15 years ago was about 10@@ 0,000 people , and today it bo@@ ast@@ s about 10 to 11 million ."
So that gi@@ ves you an idea of the kinds of mi@@ gr@@ ations and the speed with which — this is just the ta@@ x@@ is being built by V@@ ol@@ k@@ s@@ wa@@ g@@ en .
"There &apos;s 9@@ ,000 of them here , and they &apos;re being built for most of the big cities , Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing and S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i , S@@ h@@ en@@ z@@ h@@ en ."
And this isn &apos;t even the dom@@ esti@@ c car market ; this is the ta@@ x@@ i market .
"And what we would see here as a su@@ bur@@ b@@ an develo@@ pment — a si@@ mi@@ lar thing , but they &apos;re all high-@@ ri@@ ses ."
"So they &apos;ll put 20 or 40 up at a time , and they just go up in the same way as a sing@@ le@@ -@@ family dw@@ el@@ ling would go up here in an area ."
And the den@@ sity is quite incredible .
"And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out is that when I saw these kinds of buil@@ dings , I was sh@@ oc@@ ked to see that they &apos;re not using a cent@@ ral air@@ -@@ con@@ di@@ tion@@ ing system ; every win@@ do@@ w has an air con@@ di@@ tion@@ er in it ."
"And I &apos;m sure there are people here who probably know better than I do about ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ cies , but I can &apos;t imagine that every a@@ part@@ ment having its own air con@@ di@@ tion@@ er is a very ef@@ fi@@ cient way to cool a building on this scale ."
"And when you start looking at that , and then you start fac@@ tor@@ ing up into a city the size of S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i , it &apos;s liter@@ ally a fore@@ st of sk@@ y@@ sc@@ ra@@ per@@ s ."
"It &apos;s bre@@ a@@ th@@ taking , in terms of the speed at which this city is trans@@ form@@ ing ."
"And you can see in the fore@@ ground of this picture , it &apos;s still one of the last are@@ as that was being he@@ ld up ."
R@@ ight now that &apos;s all c@@ lear@@ ed out — this was done about eight months ago — and high-@@ ri@@ ses are now going up into that cent@@ ral spo@@ t .
"So a sk@@ y@@ sc@@ ra@@ per is built , liter@@ ally , over@@ night in S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i ."
"Mo@@ st re@@ cent@@ ly I went in , and I started looking at some of the bi@@ ggest indu@@ str@@ ies in China ."
"And this is B@@ a@@ ost@@ e@@ el , right outside of S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i ."
This is the co@@ al su@@ pp@@ ly for the ste@@ el fac@@ t@@ ory — 18 squ@@ are kilome@@ ters .
"It &apos;s an incredi@@ bly mas@@ sive oper@@ ation , I think 1@@ 5@@ ,000 wor@@ k@@ ers , five cu@@ pol@@ as , and the si@@ x@@ th one &apos;s coming in here ."
So they &apos;re building very large b@@ last f@@ ur@@ n@@ ac@@ es to try to deal with the de@@ m@@ and for ste@@ el in China .
So this is three of the visi@@ ble b@@ last f@@ ur@@ n@@ ac@@ es within that sh@@ ot .
"And again , looking at these images , there &apos;s this con@@ st@@ ant , like , ha@@ ze that you &apos;re seeing ."
"This is going to show you , real time , an as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ler . It &apos;s a cir@@ cu@@ it bre@@ ak@@ er ."
10 hours a day at this speed .
"I think one of the issu@@ es that we here are fac@@ ing with China , is that they &apos;re using a lot of the lat@@ est produ@@ ction technology ."
"In that one , there were 4@@ 00 people that worked on the flo@@ or ."
"And I asked the man@@ ag@@ er to point out five of your f@@ ast@@ est produ@@ c@@ ers , and then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes , and pi@@ cked this one woman ."
And it was just li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning f@@ ast ; the way she was working was almost un@@ belie@@ v@@ able .
"But that is the tri@@ ck that they &apos;ve got right now , that they &apos;re win@@ ning with , is that they &apos;re using all the lat@@ est technolog@@ ies and ex@@ tru@@ sion mach@@ ines , and br@@ ing@@ ing all the com@@ pon@@ ents into play , but the as@@ se@@ m@@ bly is where they &apos;re actually br@@ ing@@ ing in — the country wor@@ k@@ ers are very wil@@ ling to work . They want to work ."
There &apos;s a mas@@ sive back@@ lo@@ g of people wan@@ ting their j@@ ob@@ s .
"That con@@ di@@ tion &apos;s going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years if they realize what they want , which is , you know , 4@@ 00 to 500 million more people coming into the cities ."
In this particular case — this is the as@@ se@@ m@@ bly line that you saw ; this is a sh@@ ot of it .
I had to use a very small a@@ per@@ ture to get the de@@ p@@ th of fie@@ ld .
I had to have them fre@@ e@@ ze for 10 secon@@ ds to get this sh@@ ot .
It took me five fak@@ e tries because they were just going . To s@@ low them down was liter@@ ally im@@ possible .
"They were just w@@ ound up doing these things all day long , until the man@@ ag@@ er had to , with a ster@@ n vo@@ ice , say , &quot; O@@ kay , everybody fre@@ e@@ ze . &quot;"
"It wasn &apos;t too bad , but they &apos;re dri@@ ven to produ@@ ce these things at an incredible r@@ ate ."
"This is a te@@ x@@ ti@@ le mi@@ ll doing syn@@ the@@ tic sil@@ k , an oil by@@ produ@@ ct ."
"And what you &apos;re seeing here is , again , one of the most st@@ ate@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art te@@ x@@ ti@@ le mi@@ l@@ ls ."
"There are 500 of these mach@@ ines ; they &apos;re wor@@ th about 200@@ ,000 dollars each ."
"So you have about 12 people ru@@ n@@ ning this , and they &apos;re just in@@ spe@@ cting it — and they &apos;re just wal@@ king the lin@@ es ."
"The mach@@ ines are all ru@@ n@@ ning , absolu@@ tely incredible to see what the scale of indu@@ str@@ ies are ."
And I started getting in f@@ ur@@ ther and f@@ ur@@ ther into the fac@@ tor@@ ies .
And that &apos;s a di@@ p@@ tych . I do a lot of pa@@ ir@@ ings to try and get the sense of scale in these places .
"This is a line where they get the thre@@ ads and they wind the thre@@ ads together , pre@@ -@@ going into the te@@ x@@ ti@@ le mi@@ l@@ ls ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s something that &apos;s far more labor@@ -@@ inten@@ sive , which is the making of sho@@ es ."
"This flo@@ or has about 1@@ ,@@ 500 wor@@ k@@ ers on this flo@@ or ."
"The company itself had about 1@@ 0,000 em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es , and they &apos;re doing dom@@ esti@@ c sho@@ es ."
"It was very hard to get into the inter@@ national comp@@ an@@ ies because I had to get per@@ mis@@ sion from comp@@ an@@ ies like Ni@@ ke and A@@ di@@ d@@ as , and that &apos;s very hard to get ."
And they don &apos;t want to let me in .
But the dom@@ esti@@ c was much e@@ as@@ ier to do .
"It just gi@@ ves you a sense of , again — and that &apos;s where , really , the whole mi@@ gr@@ ation of j@@ ob@@ s started going over to China and making the sho@@ es . Ni@@ ke was one of the early ones ."
It was such a high lab@@ or com@@ pon@@ ent to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that lab@@ or market .
"This is a high-@@ te@@ ch mo@@ bi@@ le phone : B@@ ird mo@@ bi@@ le phone , one of the largest mo@@ bi@@ le mak@@ ers in China ."
"I think mo@@ bi@@ le phone comp@@ an@@ ies are po@@ pping up , liter@@ ally , on a we@@ ek@@ ly basi@@ s , and they have an ex@@ plo@@ sive grow@@ th in mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones ."
"This is a te@@ x@@ ti@@ le where they &apos;re doing sh@@ ir@@ ts — Y@@ oun@@ g@@ or , the bi@@ ggest sh@@ ir@@ t fac@@ t@@ ory and clo@@ thing fac@@ t@@ ory in China ."
And this next sh@@ ot here is one of the lu@@ n@@ chro@@ oms .
E@@ very@@ thing is very ef@@ fi@@ cient .
"W@@ hi@@ le se@@ tting up this sh@@ ot , people on a@@ ver@@ age would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lu@@ n@@ ch ."
This was one of the bi@@ ggest fac@@ tor@@ ies I &apos;ve ever seen .
"They make co@@ f@@ fe@@ em@@ ak@@ ers here , the bi@@ ggest co@@ f@@ fe@@ em@@ ak@@ er and the bi@@ ggest i@@ ro@@ n mak@@ ers — they make 20 million of them in the world ."
"There &apos;s 2@@ 1@@ ,000 em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es . This one fac@@ t@@ ory — and they had se@@ ver@@ al of them — is half a kilome@@ ter long ."
"These are just re@@ cent@@ ly sh@@ ot — I just came back about a mon@@ th ago , so you &apos;re the first ones to be seeing these , these new fac@@ t@@ ory pi@@ ctures I &apos;ve taken ."
So it &apos;s taken me almost a year to ga@@ in ac@@ cess into these places .
The other aspe@@ ct of what &apos;s happening in China is that there &apos;s a real need for materi@@ als there .
So a lot of the re@@ cy@@ c@@ led materi@@ als that are colle@@ cted here are being re@@ cy@@ c@@ led and taken to China by ships .
"That &apos;s cu@@ bed me@@ tal . This is ar@@ mat@@ ures , electri@@ cal ar@@ mat@@ ures , where they &apos;re getting the cop@@ per and the high-@@ end ste@@ el from electri@@ cal mot@@ ors out , and re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling them ."
This is cer@@ tain@@ ly conne@@ cted to C@@ alifor@@ nia and S@@ i@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ ley .
But this is what happens to most of the compu@@ ters .
F@@ i@@ f@@ ty percent of the world &apos;s compu@@ ters end up in China to be re@@ cy@@ c@@ led .
It &apos;s re@@ fer@@ red to as &quot; &quot; e-@@ wa@@ ste &quot; &quot; there .
"And it is a bit of a problem . The way they re@@ cy@@ cle the bo@@ ar@@ ds is that they actually use the co@@ al bri@@ qu@@ et@@ tes , which are used all through China , but they he@@ at up the bo@@ ar@@ ds , and with pa@@ ir@@ s of pl@@ ier@@ s they pu@@ ll off all the com@@ pon@@ ents ."
They &apos;re trying to get all the val@@ u@@ ed me@@ tal@@ s out of those com@@ pon@@ ents .
"But the to@@ x@@ ic s@@ me@@ l@@ ls — when you come into a tow@@ n that &apos;s actually doing this kind of bur@@ ning of the bo@@ ar@@ ds , you can s@@ me@@ ll it a good five or 10 kilome@@ ters before you get there ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s another oper@@ ation . It &apos;s all c@@ ot@@ t@@ age indu@@ str@@ ies , so it &apos;s not big places — it &apos;s all in people &apos;s front por@@ ch@@ es , in their back@@ y@@ ar@@ ds , even in their hom@@ es they &apos;re bur@@ ning bo@@ ar@@ ds , if there &apos;s a con@@ cer@@ n for somebody coming by — because it is consi@@ der@@ ed in China to be il@@ leg@@ al , doing it , but they can &apos;t stop the produ@@ ct from coming in ."
"This por@@ tra@@ it — I &apos;m not usu@@ ally known for por@@ tra@@ its , but I couldn &apos;t resi@@ st this one , where she &apos;s been through Ma@@ o , and she &apos;s been through the Gre@@ at Le@@ a@@ p F@@ or@@ ward , and the C@@ ul@@ tu@@ ral R@@ ev@@ olution , and now she &apos;s sitting on her por@@ ch with this e-@@ wa@@ ste be@@ side her . It &apos;s quite something ."
This is a ro@@ ad where it &apos;s been sho@@ red up by computer bo@@ ar@@ ds in one of the bi@@ ggest tow@@ ns where they &apos;re re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling .
So that &apos;s the photograph@@ s that I wanted to show you .
( Applause ) I want to de@@ di@@ cate my wi@@ sh@@ es to my two girls .
They &apos;ve been sitting on my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der the whole time while I &apos;ve been thinking .
"One &apos;s Me@@ g@@ an , the one of the right , and K@@ at@@ ja there ."
And to me the whole noti@@ on — the things I &apos;m photograph@@ ing are out of a great con@@ cer@@ n about the scale of our pro@@ gre@@ ss and what we call pro@@ gre@@ ss .
"And as much as there are great things around the cor@@ ner — and it &apos;s pal@@ p@@ able in this room — of all of the things that are just about to bre@@ ak that can sol@@ ve so many problems , I &apos;m really hop@@ ing that those things will sp@@ read around the world and will start to have a posi@@ tive effe@@ ct ."
"And it isn &apos;t something that isn &apos;t just af@@ fe@@ cting our world , but it star@@ ts to go up — because I think we can start cor@@ re@@ cting our fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int and bring it down — but there &apos;s a grow@@ ing fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int that &apos;s happening in A@@ si@@ a , and is grow@@ ing at a ra@@ pi@@ d , ra@@ pi@@ d r@@ ate , and so I don &apos;t think we can equ@@ ali@@ ze it . So ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely the strate@@ gy , I think , here is that we have to be very con@@ cer@@ ned about their ev@@ olution , because it is going to be conne@@ cted to our ev@@ olution as well ."
"So part of my thinking , and part of my wi@@ sh@@ es , is sitting with these thou@@ ghts in mind , and thinking about , &quot; &quot; How is their life going to be when they want to have children , or when they &apos;re ready to get mar@@ ried 20 years from now — or whatever , 15 years from now ? &quot; &quot; And to me that has been the cor@@ e behind most of my thinking — in my work , and also for this incredible ch@@ ance to have some wi@@ sh@@ es ."
W@@ is@@ h one : wor@@ l@@ d-@@ chang@@ ing . I want to use my images to per@@ su@@ ade mi@@ llions of people to jo@@ in in the global convers@@ ation on susta@@ in@@ ability .
And it is through communi@@ c@@ ations today that I believe that that is not an un@@ real idea .
"O@@ h , and I went in sear@@ ch — I wanted to put what I had in mind , hi@@ t@@ ch it on@@ to something . I didn &apos;t want a wi@@ sh just to start from now@@ here ."
"One of them I &apos;m star@@ ting from almost nothing , but the other one , I wanted to find out what &apos;s going on that &apos;s working right now ."
"And Wor@@ l@@ d@@ chang@@ ing@@ .@@ co@@ m is a fanta@@ stic blo@@ g , and that blo@@ g is now being visi@@ ted by close to hal@@ f-@@ a@@ -@@ million people a mon@@ th ."
And it just started about 14 months ago .
And the beau@@ ty of what &apos;s going on there is that the t@@ one of the convers@@ ation is the t@@ one that I like .
What they &apos;re doing there is that they &apos;re not — I think the environ@@ ment@@ al movement has fai@@ led in that it &apos;s used the sti@@ ck too much ; it &apos;s used the apo@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic t@@ one too much ; it ha@@ sn &apos;t s@@ old the posi@@ tive aspe@@ cts of being environ@@ ment@@ ally con@@ cer@@ ned and trying to pu@@ ll us out .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as this convers@@ ation that is going on in this blo@@ g is about posi@@ tive mov@@ em@@ ents , about how to change our world in a better way , quickly ."
"And it &apos;s looking at technology , and it &apos;s looking at new ener@@ g@@ y@@ -@@ sa@@ ving de@@ vi@@ ces , and it &apos;s looking at how to re@@ think and how to re@@ -@@ strate@@ gi@@ ze the movement towar@@ ds susta@@ in@@ ability ."
"And so for me , one of the things that I thought would be to put some of my work in the ser@@ vice of pro@@ mot@@ ing the Wor@@ l@@ d@@ chang@@ ing@@ .@@ co@@ m we@@ b@@ site ."
"S@@ ome of you might know , he &apos;s a TE@@ D@@ ster — Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ ag@@ me@@ ist@@ er and I are working on some la@@ y@@ ou@@ ts . And this is still in pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary st@@ ages ; these ar@@ en &apos;t the fin@@ als . But these images , with Wor@@ l@@ d@@ chang@@ ing@@ .@@ co@@ m , can be plac@@ ed into any kind of media ."
"They could be post@@ ed through the W@@ e@@ b ; they could be used as a bi@@ ll@@ bo@@ ard or a bu@@ s sh@@ el@@ ter , or anything of that nature ."
So we &apos;re looking at this as trying to build out .
"And what we en@@ ded up di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing was that in most media you get mo@@ st@@ ly an image with a lot of te@@ xt , and the te@@ xt is b@@ la@@ st@@ ed all over ."
"What was un@@ usu@@ al , ac@@ cor@@ ding to Ste@@ ph@@ en , is less than five percent of ads are actually le@@ ading with image ."
"And so in this case , because it &apos;s about a lot of these images and what they re@@ present , and the kinds of questions they bring up , that we thought le@@ tting the images play out and bring someone to say , &quot; Well , what &apos;s Wor@@ l@@ d@@ chang@@ ing@@ .@@ co@@ m , with these images , have to do ? &quot;"
And hop@@ e@@ fully inspi@@ re people to go to that we@@ b@@ site .
"So Wor@@ l@@ d@@ chang@@ ing@@ .@@ co@@ m , and building that blo@@ g , and it is a blo@@ g , and I &apos;m hop@@ ing that it isn &apos;t — I don &apos;t see it as the kind of blo@@ g where we &apos;re all going to fol@@ low each other to death ."
"This one is one that will spo@@ ke out , and will go out , and to start re@@ ach@@ ing . Because right now there &apos;s convers@@ ations in Indi@@ a , in China , in S@@ outh America — there &apos;s en@@ tries coming from all around the world ."
"I think there &apos;s a ch@@ ance to have a di@@ al@@ og@@ ue , a convers@@ ation about susta@@ in@@ ability at Wor@@ l@@ d@@ chang@@ ing@@ .@@ com@@ ."
And anything that you can do to pro@@ mot@@ e that would be fanta@@ stic .
"W@@ is@@ h two is more of the bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up , gro@@ un@@ d-@@ up one that I &apos;m trying to work with ."
"And this one is : I wi@@ sh to la@@ un@@ ch a gro@@ un@@ d@@ bre@@ aking compe@@ ti@@ tion that moti@@ v@@ ates kids to inv@@ est ideas on , and inv@@ ent ideas on , susta@@ in@@ ability ."
"And one of the things that came out — A@@ lli@@ son , who actually n@@ om@@ in@@ ated me , said something ear@@ lie@@ r on in a bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming . She said that re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling in C@@ an@@ ada had a fanta@@ stic en@@ try into our psy@@ ch@@ e through kids between gra@@ de four and six ."
"And you think about it , you know , gra@@ de four — my wi@@ fe and I , we say age seven is the age of reason , so they &apos;re into the age of reason . And they &apos;re pre@@ -@@ pu@@ ber@@ ty ."
So it &apos;s this great win@@ do@@ w where they actually are — you can in@@ flu@@ ence them . You know what happens at pu@@ ber@@ ty ?
"You know , we know that from ear@@ lie@@ r pres@@ ent@@ ations ."
"So my thinking here is that we try to moti@@ v@@ ate those kids to start dri@@ ving home ideas . Let them understand what susta@@ in@@ ability is , and that they have a v@@ est@@ ed inter@@ est in it to happen ."
"And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my pri@@ ze , so I would take 3@@ 0,000 or 4@@ 0,000 dollars of the win@@ n@@ ings , and the rest is going to be to man@@ age this project , but to use that as pri@@ z@@ es for kids to get into their h@@ ands ."
"But the other thing that I thought would be fanta@@ stic was to create these — call them &quot; &quot; pri@@ ze tar@@ gets . &quot; &quot; And so one could be for the best susta@@ in@@ able idea for an in@@ -@@ school project , the best one for a hou@@ se@@ h@@ old project , or it could be the best community project for susta@@ in@@ ability ."
"And I also thought there should be a nice pri@@ ze for the best ar@@ t@@ work for &quot; &quot; In My World . &quot; &quot; And what would happen — it &apos;s a sc@@ al@@ able thing . And if we can get people to put in things — whether it &apos;s e@@ qui@@ pment , like a media la@@ b , or money to make the pri@@ ze sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant enough — and to open it up to all the scho@@ ols that are public scho@@ ols , or scho@@ ols that are with kids that age , and make it a wi@@ de@@ -@@ open compe@@ ti@@ tion for them to go after those pri@@ z@@ es and to sub@@ m@@ it them ."
"And the pri@@ ze has to be a ver@@ i@@ fi@@ able thing , so it &apos;s not about just ideas ."
"The art pie@@ ces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them , but the ac@@ tu@@ al things have to be ver@@ i@@ fi@@ able ."
"In that way , what &apos;s happening is that we &apos;re moti@@ v@@ ating a certain age group to start thinking ."
"And they &apos;re going to p@@ us@@ h that up , from the bot@@ tom — up into , I believe , into the hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds . And parents will be re@@ ac@@ ting to it , and trying to help them with the proje@@ cts ."
"And I think it star@@ ts to moti@@ v@@ ate the whole idea towar@@ ds susta@@ in@@ ability in a very posi@@ tive way , and star@@ ts to te@@ ach them . They know about re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling now , but they don &apos;t really , I think , get susta@@ in@@ ability in all the things , and the energy fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int , and how that mat@@ ters ."
"And to te@@ ach them , to me , would be a fanta@@ stic wi@@ sh , and it would be something that I would cer@@ tain@@ ly put my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der into ."
"And again , in &quot; &quot; In My World , &quot; &quot; the compe@@ ti@@ tion — we would use the ar@@ t@@ work that comes in from that compe@@ ti@@ tion to pro@@ mot@@ e it ."
"And I like the words , &quot; &quot; in my world , &quot; &quot; because it gi@@ ves pos@@ s@@ es@@ sion of the world to the person who &apos;s doing it ."
"It is my world ; it &apos;s not someone else &apos;s . I want to help it ; I want to do something with it . So I think it has a great opportunity to eng@@ age the imag@@ in@@ ations — and great ideas , I think , come from kids — and eng@@ age their imag@@ in@@ ation into a project , and do something for scho@@ ols ."
"I think all scho@@ ols could use ex@@ tra e@@ qui@@ pment , ex@@ tra c@@ as@@ h — it &apos;s going to be an in@@ cen@@ tive for them to do that ."
"And these are some of the ideas in terms of where we could possi@@ bly put in some pro@@ moti@@ on for &quot; &quot; In My World . &quot; &quot; And wi@@ sh three is : I@@ ma@@ x film . So I was told I should do one for myself , and I &apos;ve always wanted to actually get inv@@ olved with doing something ."
"And the scale of my work , and the kinds of ideas I &apos;m playing with — when I first saw an I@@ ma@@ x film , I almost im@@ medi@@ ately thought , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a real re@@ son@@ ance between what I &apos;m trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photograph@@ er . &quot; &quot; And I think there &apos;s a real possi@@ bility to re@@ ach new aud@@ ien@@ ces if I had a ch@@ ance ."
"So I &apos;m looking , really , for a ment@@ or , because I just had my bir@@ th@@ day ."
"I &apos;m 50 , and I don &apos;t have time to go back to school right now — I &apos;m too bus@@ y . So I need somebody who can put me on a qui@@ ck cat@@ ch@@ -@@ up course on how to do something like that , and le@@ ad me through the ma@@ ze of how one does something like this ."
That would be fanta@@ stic . So those are my three wi@@ sh@@ es .
( Applause )
Go@@ od ev@@ ening .
"We are in this wonderful open@@ -@@ air am@@ phi@@ the@@ ater and we are en@@ jo@@ ying ourselves in that mi@@ ld ev@@ ening temper@@ ature ton@@ ight , but when Q@@ at@@ ar will ho@@ st the fo@@ ot@@ ball World C@@ up 10 years from now , 20@@ 2@@ 2 , we already heard it will be in the ho@@ t , very ho@@ t and su@@ n@@ ny sum@@ m@@ er months of Ju@@ ne and Ju@@ ly ."
"And when Q@@ at@@ ar has been as@@ sig@@ ned to the World C@@ up all , many people around the world have been wonder@@ ing , how would it be possible that fo@@ ot@@ ball pla@@ y@@ ers show spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar fo@@ ot@@ ball , run around in this des@@ er@@ t clim@@ ate ? How would it be possible that spe@@ ct@@ at@@ ors si@@ t , en@@ jo@@ y themselves in open@@ -@@ air st@@ ad@@ ia in this ho@@ t environment ?"
"T@@ og@@ e@@ ther with the archite@@ cts of Al@@ ber@@ t S@@ pe@@ er &a@@ m@@ p@@ ; Par@@ t@@ ner , our engine@@ ers from T@@ ran@@ s@@ solar have been sup@@ por@@ ting , have been develo@@ ping open@@ -@@ air st@@ ad@@ ia based on 100 percent solar power , on 100 percent solar co@@ ol@@ ing ."
"L@@ et me tell you about that , but let me start with comfor@@ t ."
"L@@ et me start with the aspe@@ ct of comfor@@ t , because many people are con@@ f@@ using am@@ b@@ ien@@ t temper@@ ature with ther@@ mal comfor@@ t ."
"We are used to looking at char@@ ts like that , and you see this red line show@@ ing the air temper@@ ature in Ju@@ ne and Ju@@ ly , and y@@ es , that &apos;s right , it &apos;s pi@@ c@@ king up to 4@@ 5 de@@ gre@@ es C@@ ."
It &apos;s actually very ho@@ t .
But air temper@@ ature is not the full set of clim@@ atic par@@ am@@ e@@ ters which def@@ ine comfor@@ t .
"L@@ et me show you an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s a colle@@ ag@@ ue of m@@ ine did looking on different fo@@ ot@@ ball , World C@@ u@@ ps , O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c G@@ am@@ es around the world , looking on the comfor@@ t and an@@ al@@ yz@@ ing the comfor@@ t people have per@@ cei@@ ved at these different spor@@ t acti@@ vi@@ ties , and let me start with M@@ exi@@ co ."
"M@@ exi@@ co temper@@ ature has been , air temper@@ ature has been something between 15 , up to 30 de@@ gre@@ es C , and people en@@ jo@@ yed themselves ."
It was a very comfor@@ table g@@ ame in M@@ exi@@ co C@@ ity . Ha@@ ve a look .
"O@@ r@@ lan@@ do , same kind of st@@ ad@@ i@@ um , open@@ -@@ air st@@ ad@@ i@@ um . Pe@@ ople have been sitting in the stron@@ g su@@ n , in the very high hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , and they did not en@@ jo@@ y . It was not comfor@@ table ."
"The air temper@@ ature was not too high , but it was not comfor@@ table during these g@@ am@@ es ."
"What about Se@@ ou@@ l ? Se@@ ou@@ l , because of bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast ri@@ ghts , all the g@@ am@@ es have been in the l@@ ate af@@ ter@@ no@@ on . Su@@ n has already been set , so the g@@ am@@ es have been per@@ cei@@ ved as comfor@@ table ."
"What about A@@ th@@ ens ? Me@@ di@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an clim@@ ate , but in the su@@ n it was not comfor@@ table . They didn &apos;t per@@ cei@@ ve comfor@@ t ."
"And we know that from S@@ pa@@ in , we know that &quot; &quot; so@@ l y som@@ br@@ a . &quot; &quot; If you have a ti@@ ck@@ et , and you get a ti@@ ck@@ et for the sha@@ de , you pay more , because you &apos;re in a more comfor@@ table environment ."
What about Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing ?
"It &apos;s again , su@@ n in the day and high hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty , and it was not comfor@@ table ."
"So if I over@@ l@@ ay , and if you over@@ l@@ ay all these comfor@@ t en@@ velo@@ p@@ es , what we see is , in all these places , air temper@@ ature has been r@@ ang@@ ing something from 25 to 3@@ 5 , and if you go on the line , 30 , of 30 de@@ gre@@ es C am@@ b@@ ien@@ t temper@@ at@@ ures . If you go along that line you see there has been all kind of comfor@@ t , all kinds of per@@ cei@@ ved out@@ door comfor@@ t , r@@ ang@@ ing from very comfor@@ table to very un@@ comfor@@ table ."
So why is that ?
"This is because there are more par@@ am@@ e@@ ters in@@ flu@@ en@@ cing our ther@@ mal comfor@@ t , which is the su@@ n , the dire@@ ct su@@ n , the dif@@ f@@ use su@@ n , which is wind , stron@@ g wind , mi@@ ld wind , which is air hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty , which is the radi@@ ant temper@@ ature of the sur@@ ro@@ un@@ dings where we are in ."
And this is air temper@@ ature .
"A@@ ll these par@@ am@@ e@@ ters go into the comfor@@ t feeling of our human body , and scienti@@ sts have develo@@ ped a par@@ am@@ e@@ ter , which is the per@@ cei@@ ved temper@@ ature , where all these par@@ am@@ e@@ ters go in and help desig@@ n@@ ers to understand which is the dri@@ ving par@@ am@@ e@@ ter that I feel comfor@@ t or that I don &apos;t feel comfor@@ t ."
"Wh@@ ich is the dri@@ ving par@@ am@@ e@@ ter which gi@@ ves me a per@@ cei@@ ved temper@@ ature ? And these par@@ am@@ e@@ ters , these clim@@ atic par@@ am@@ e@@ ters are re@@ lated to the human me@@ tab@@ o@@ li@@ sm ."
"Because of our me@@ tab@@ o@@ li@@ sm , we as human be@@ ings , we produ@@ ce he@@ at ."
"I &apos;m exci@@ ted , I &apos;m talking to you , I &apos;m probably produ@@ cing 1@@ 50 wat@@ ts at the moment . You are sitting , you are re@@ la@@ x@@ ed , you &apos;re looking at me . It &apos;s probably 100 wat@@ ts each person is produ@@ cing , and we need to get ri@@ d of that energy . I need , with my body , to get ri@@ d of the energy , and the har@@ der it is for myself , for my body , to get ri@@ d of the energy , the less comfor@@ t I feel ."
"That &apos;s it . And if I don &apos;t get ri@@ d of the energy , I will die ."
"If we over@@ l@@ ay what happens during the fo@@ ot@@ ball World C@@ up , what will happen in Ju@@ ne , Ju@@ ly , we will see , y@@ es , air temper@@ ature will be much high@@ er , but because the g@@ am@@ es and the pla@@ ys will be in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , it &apos;s probably the same comfor@@ t r@@ ating we &apos;ve found in other places which has per@@ cei@@ ved as n@@ on-@@ comfor@@ table ."
"So we s@@ at together with a team which pre@@ par@@ ed the B@@ id B@@ ook , or go@@ al , that we said , let &apos;s a@@ im for per@@ cei@@ ved temper@@ ature , for out@@ door comfor@@ t in this r@@ ange , which is per@@ cei@@ ved with a temper@@ ature of 3@@ 2 de@@ gre@@ es C@@ el@@ si@@ us per@@ cei@@ ved temper@@ ature , which is extre@@ me@@ ly comfor@@ table ."
Pe@@ ople would feel really f@@ ine in an open out@@ door environment .
But what does it mean ?
"If we just look on what happens , we see , temper@@ ature &apos;s too high ."
"If we app@@ ly the best archite@@ ctu@@ ral design , clim@@ ate engine@@ ering design , we won &apos;t get much better ."
So we need to do something ac@@ tive .
"We need , for in@@ stance , to bring in radi@@ ant co@@ ol@@ ing technology , and we need to com@@ b@@ ine this with so@@ -@@ called so@@ ft con@@ di@@ tion@@ ing ."
And how does it look like in a st@@ ad@@ i@@ um ?
"So the st@@ ad@@ i@@ um has a few ele@@ ments which create that out@@ door comfor@@ t . F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s sha@@ ding . It needs to prote@@ ct where the people are sitting against stron@@ g and war@@ m wind ."
But that &apos;s not all what we need to do . We need to use ac@@ tive systems .
"In@@ ste@@ ad of b@@ low@@ ing a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ c@@ ane of chil@@ led air through the st@@ ad@@ i@@ um , we can use radi@@ ant co@@ ol@@ ing technolog@@ ies , like a flo@@ or he@@ ating system where water pi@@ p@@ es are em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the flo@@ or ."
"And just by using c@@ old water going through the water pi@@ p@@ es , you can rele@@ ase the he@@ at which is ab@@ sor@@ bed during the day in the st@@ ad@@ i@@ um , so you can create that comfor@@ t , and then by ad@@ ding d@@ ry air instead of dow@@ n@@ -@@ chil@@ led air , the spe@@ ct@@ at@@ ors and the fo@@ ot@@ ball pla@@ y@@ ers can ad@@ just to their individu@@ al comfor@@ t needs , to their individu@@ al energy bal@@ ance ."
They can ad@@ just and find their comfor@@ t they need to find .
"There are 12 st@@ ad@@ ia probably to come , but there are 3@@ 2 tra@@ ining pit@@ ch@@ es where all the individu@@ al countries are going to tra@@ in ."
"We ap@@ pl@@ ied the same con@@ cept : sha@@ ding of the tra@@ ining pit@@ ch , using a sh@@ el@@ ter against wind , then using the gra@@ ss ."
"N@@ atur@@ al@@ -@@ wat@@ er@@ ed l@@ aw@@ n is a very good co@@ ol@@ ing source st@@ abi@@ liz@@ ing temper@@ ature , and using de@@ hu@@ mi@@ dif@@ ied air to create comfor@@ t ."
But even the best pas@@ sive design wouldn &apos;t help .
We need ac@@ tive system .
And how do we do that ?
"O@@ ur idea for the bi@@ d was 100 percent solar co@@ ol@@ ing , based on the idea that we use the ro@@ of of the st@@ ad@@ ia , we co@@ ver the ro@@ of@@ s of the st@@ ad@@ ia with P@@ V systems ."
We don &apos;t bor@@ row any energy from history .
We are not using f@@ os@@ si@@ l ener@@ g@@ ies .
We are not bor@@ row@@ ing energy from our neigh@@ b@@ ors .
"We &apos;re using energy we can har@@ v@@ est on our ro@@ of@@ s , and also on the tra@@ ining pit@@ ch@@ es , which will be co@@ vered with large , f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble mem@@ bran@@ es , and we will see in the next years an indu@@ stry coming up with f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble ph@@ ot@@ o@@ vol@@ ta@@ i@@ cs , gi@@ ving the possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies of sha@@ ding against stron@@ g su@@ n and produ@@ cing electri@@ c energy in the same time ."
"And this energy now is har@@ v@@ est@@ ed throu@@ gh@@ out the year , s@@ ent into the g@@ ri@@ d , is re@@ plac@@ ing f@@ os@@ si@@ ls in the g@@ ri@@ d , and when I need it for the co@@ ol@@ ing , I take it back from the g@@ ri@@ d and I use the solar energy which I have brought to the g@@ ri@@ d back when I need it for the solar co@@ ol@@ ing ."
"And I can do that in the first year and I can bal@@ ance that in the next 10 , and the next 20 years , this energy , which is ne@@ cess@@ ary to con@@ di@@ tion a World C@@ up in Q@@ at@@ ar , the next 20 years , this energy goes into the g@@ ri@@ d of Q@@ at@@ ar ."
"So this — ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) This is not only us@@ e@@ ful for st@@ ad@@ ia . We can use that also in open@@ -@@ air places and stre@@ ets , and we &apos;ve been working on the C@@ ity of the F@@ u@@ ture in M@@ as@@ d@@ ar , which is in the United E@@ mi@@ r@@ ates , A@@ b@@ u D@@ ha@@ b@@ i ."
And I had the ple@@ as@@ ure to work on the cent@@ ral pla@@ za .
"And the same idea to use there , to create out@@ door con@@ di@@ tions which are per@@ cei@@ ved as comfor@@ table . Pe@@ ople en@@ jo@@ y going there instead of going into a sh@@ op@@ ping mall , which is chil@@ led down and which is co@@ o@@ led . We wanted to create an out@@ door space which is so comfor@@ table that people can go there in the early af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , even in these su@@ n@@ ny and ho@@ t sum@@ m@@ er months , and they can en@@ jo@@ y and me@@ et there with their fam@@ il@@ ies . ( Applause ) And the same con@@ cept : sha@@ de against the su@@ n , sha@@ de against the wind , and use , use and take adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of the su@@ n you can har@@ v@@ est on your fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int ."
And these beautiful um@@ b@@ rel@@ l@@ as .
"So I &apos;d like to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you to pay at@@ ten@@ tion to your ther@@ mal comfor@@ t , to your ther@@ mal environment , ton@@ ight and tom@@ or@@ row , and if you &apos;d like to learn more about that , I in@@ vi@@ te you to go to our we@@ b@@ site ."
We up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed a very simple per@@ cei@@ ved temper@@ ature cal@@ cu@@ lat@@ or where you can che@@ ck out about your out@@ door comfor@@ t .
"And I also hope that you share the idea that if engine@@ ers and desig@@ n@@ ers can use all these different clim@@ atic par@@ am@@ e@@ ters , it will be possible to create really good and comfor@@ table out@@ door con@@ di@@ tions , to change our ther@@ mal per@@ cep@@ tion that we feel comfor@@ table in an out@@ door environment , and we can do that with the best pas@@ sive design , but also using the energy source of the site in Q@@ at@@ ar which is the su@@ n ."

"We see with the eyes , but we see with the brain as well ."
And seeing with the brain is often called imag@@ in@@ ation .
"And we are fami@@ li@@ ar with the land@@ s@@ cap@@ es of our own imag@@ in@@ ation , our in@@ s@@ cap@@ es . We &apos;ve li@@ ved with them all our lives ."
"But there are also hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations as well , and hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations are completely different ."
They don &apos;t se@@ em to be of our cre@@ ation .
They don &apos;t se@@ em to be under our control .
"They se@@ em to come from the outside , and to mi@@ mi@@ c per@@ cep@@ tion ."
"So I am going to be talking about hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations , and a particular sort of vi@@ su@@ al hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ation which I see am@@ ong my patients ."
"A few months ago , I got a phone call from a n@@ ur@@ sing home where I work ."
"They told me that one of their resi@@ d@@ ents , an old l@@ ady in her 9@@ 0s , was seeing things , and they wonder@@ ed if she &apos;d gone b@@ on@@ k@@ ers or , because she was an old l@@ ady , whether she &apos;d had a stro@@ ke , or whether she had Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s ."
"And so they asked me if I would come and see R@@ os@@ al@@ ie , the old l@@ ady ."
I went in to see her .
"It was evi@@ dent stra@@ ight away that she was perfe@@ ct@@ ly s@@ ane and lu@@ ci@@ d and of good inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence , but she &apos;d been very star@@ t@@ led and very be@@ wil@@ der@@ ed , because she &apos;d been seeing things ."
"And she told me — the n@@ ur@@ ses ha@@ dn &apos;t men@@ tion@@ ed this — that she was bl@@ ind , that she had been completely bl@@ ind from m@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar de@@ gener@@ ation for five years ."
"But now , for the last few days , she &apos;d been seeing things ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; What sort of things ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Pe@@ ople in E@@ ast@@ er@@ n dre@@ ss , in dra@@ p@@ es , wal@@ king up and down sta@@ ir@@ s ."
A man who turns towar@@ ds me and s@@ miles .

"I see a white building . It &apos;s s@@ now@@ ing , a so@@ ft s@@ now ."
"I see this hor@@ se with a har@@ ness , dra@@ gg@@ ing the s@@ now away ."
"Th@@ en , one night , the scen@@ e chang@@ es ."
I see cat@@ s and do@@ gs wal@@ king towar@@ ds me .
They come to a certain point and then stop .
Th@@ en it chang@@ es again .
I see a lot of children . They are wal@@ king up and down sta@@ ir@@ s .
"They we@@ ar b@@ right col@@ ors , ro@@ se and blue , like E@@ ast@@ er@@ n dre@@ ss . &quot; &quot; S@@ ome@@ times , she said , before the people come on , she may hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ate p@@ in@@ k and blue squ@@ ar@@ es on the flo@@ or , which se@@ em to go up to the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Is this like a dre@@ am ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s not like a dre@@ am . It &apos;s like a movie . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s got color . It &apos;s got moti@@ on ."
"But it &apos;s completely sil@@ ent , like a sil@@ ent movie . &quot; &quot; And she said that it &apos;s a rather bor@@ ing movie ."
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; All these people with E@@ ast@@ er@@ n dre@@ ss , wal@@ king up and down , very re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive , very li@@ mi@@ ted . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she has a sense of hu@@ mo@@ r ."
She knew it was a hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ation .
But she was f@@ ri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed . She &apos;d li@@ ved 9@@ 5 years and she &apos;d never had a hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ation before .
"S@@ he said that the hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations were un@@ re@@ lated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing , that they seem@@ ed to come on by themselves , or disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar ."
She had no control over them .
She said she didn &apos;t re@@ cogni@@ ze any of the people or places in the hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations .
"And n@@ one of the people or the animals , well , they all seem@@ ed ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of her ."
And she didn &apos;t know what was going on .
She wonder@@ ed if she was going ma@@ d or lo@@ sing her mind .
"Well , I exam@@ ined her car@@ e@@ fully ."
"S@@ he was a b@@ right old l@@ ady , perfe@@ ct@@ ly s@@ ane . She had no medi@@ cal problems ."
She wasn &apos;t on any medi@@ c@@ ations which could produ@@ ce hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations .
But she was bl@@ ind .
"And I then said to her , &quot; I think I know what you have . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; There is a spe@@ cial form of vi@@ su@@ al hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ation which may go with de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ating vision or b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness ."
"This was ori@@ gin@@ ally descri@@ bed , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; right back in the 1@@ 8@@ th century , by a man called Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net ."
And you have Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net syn@@ dro@@ me .
There is nothing wrong with your brain . There is nothing wrong with your mind .
"You have Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net syn@@ dro@@ me . &quot; &quot; And she was very re@@ lie@@ ved at this , that there was nothing seri@@ ously the matter , and also rather cu@@ ri@@ ous ."
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o is this Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; D@@ id he have them hi@@ m@@ self ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; T@@ ell all the n@@ ur@@ ses that I have Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net syn@@ dro@@ me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I &apos;m not c@@ razy . I &apos;m not de@@ men@@ ted . I have Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net syn@@ dro@@ me . &quot;"
"Well , so I did tell the n@@ ur@@ ses ."
"Now this , for me , is a common situ@@ ation ."
"I work in ol@@ d-@@ age hom@@ es , lar@@ ge@@ ly ."
I see a lot of el@@ der@@ ly people who are hear@@ ing im@@ pa@@ i@@ red or vi@@ su@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red .
A@@ b@@ out 10 percent of the hear@@ ing im@@ pa@@ i@@ red people get musi@@ cal hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations .
And about 10 percent of the vi@@ su@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red people get vi@@ su@@ al hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations .
"You don &apos;t have to be completely bl@@ ind , only su@@ f@@ fi@@ cien@@ tly im@@ pa@@ i@@ red ."
"Now with the ori@@ gin@@ al descri@@ ption in the 1@@ 8@@ th century , Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ on@@ net did not have them ."
H@@ is grand@@ father had these hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations .
"H@@ is grand@@ father was a mag@@ ist@@ r@@ ate , an el@@ der@@ ly man ."
He &apos;d had cat@@ ar@@ act sur@@ g@@ ery .
H@@ is vision was pretty po@@ or .
"And in 1@@ 7@@ 5@@ 9 , he descri@@ bed to his grand@@ son v@@ ari@@ ous things he was seeing ."
The first thing he said was he saw a hand@@ k@@ er@@ ch@@ ie@@ f in mi@@ da@@ ir .
It was a large blue hand@@ k@@ er@@ ch@@ ie@@ f with four or@@ ange cir@@ cles .
And he knew it was a hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ation .
You don &apos;t have hand@@ k@@ er@@ ch@@ ie@@ f@@ s in mi@@ da@@ ir .
And then he saw a big whe@@ el in mi@@ da@@ ir .
"But sometimes he wasn &apos;t sure whether he was hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ating or not , because the hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations would f@@ it in the con@@ te@@ xt of the vi@@ sions ."
"So on one oc@@ ca@@ sion , when his gran@@ dd@@ augh@@ ters were visi@@ ting them , he said , &quot; &quot; And who are these hand@@ some young men with you ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Al@@ as , G@@ ran@@ d@@ pa@@ p@@ a , there are no hand@@ some young men . &quot; &quot; And then the hand@@ some young men disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ared ."
It &apos;s ty@@ pi@@ cal of these hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations that they may come in a f@@ las@@ h and disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar in a f@@ las@@ h .
They don &apos;t usu@@ ally f@@ ade in and out .
"They are rather sud@@ den , and they change sud@@ den@@ ly ."
"Ch@@ ar@@ les Lu@@ lli@@ n , the grand@@ father , saw hundre@@ ds of different figu@@ res , different land@@ s@@ cap@@ es of all sor@@ ts ."
"O@@ n one oc@@ ca@@ sion , he saw a man in a ba@@ th@@ ro@@ be smo@@ king a pi@@ pe , and realized it was hi@@ m@@ self ."
That was the only figure he re@@ cogni@@ zed .
"O@@ n one oc@@ ca@@ sion when he was wal@@ king in the stre@@ ets of Par@@ is , he saw — this was real — a s@@ ca@@ f@@ fol@@ ding ."
"But when he got back home , he saw a min@@ i@@ ature of the s@@ ca@@ f@@ fol@@ ding six in@@ ch@@ es high , on his study table ."
This re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion of per@@ cep@@ tion is sometimes called pal@@ in@@ op@@ si@@ a .
"Wi@@ th him and with R@@ os@@ al@@ ie , what seem@@ s to be going on — and R@@ os@@ al@@ ie said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; — and I said that as you lo@@ se vision , as the vi@@ su@@ al par@@ ts of the brain are no longer getting any in@@ put , they become hy@@ per@@ ac@@ tive and exci@@ table , and they start to fi@@ re spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously ."

"S@@ e@@ e , I gave a piece of myself in these places , and what I wal@@ ked away with was a sense of fu@@ l@@ fil@@ l@@ ment I had always been sear@@ ching for ."
So I look back at this photogra@@ ph .
"It &apos;s e@@ asy to see f@@ roz@@ en fin@@ g@@ ers and c@@ old we@@ t@@ su@@ its and even the stru@@ gg@@ le that it took just to get there , but most of all , what I see is just jo@@ y ."
Thank you so much .

Mi@@ ran@@ da W@@ an@@ g : We &apos;re here to talk about ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents .
How do you feel about ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents ?
"When we think about ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents , we usu@@ ally consi@@ der them to be har@@ m@@ ful , un@@ for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate or even d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous , and they cer@@ tain@@ ly can be ."
But are they always that bad ?
"The disco@@ very that had led to p@@ eni@@ ci@@ lli@@ n , for example , is one of the most for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents of all time ."
"Wi@@ th@@ out biologi@@ st A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der F@@ le@@ ming &apos;s mo@@ l@@ dy ac@@ ci@@ dent , ca@@ used by a neg@@ le@@ cted wor@@ k@@ st@@ ation , we wouldn &apos;t be able to fi@@ ght off so many bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al in@@ fe@@ ctions ."
"In 20@@ 11 , we visi@@ ted the V@@ an@@ cou@@ ver W@@ ast@@ e T@@ ran@@ s@@ f@@ er St@@ ation and saw an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous p@@ it of pla@@ stic wa@@ ste ."
"M@@ W : H@@ ow@@ ever , pla@@ sti@@ cs are us@@ e@@ ful because they &apos;re du@@ ra@@ ble , f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble , and can be e@@ a@@ si@@ ly mo@@ l@@ ded into so many us@@ e@@ ful sha@@ p@@ es ."
The dow@@ n@@ side of this con@@ ven@@ ience is that there &apos;s a high cost to this .
This picture you see here is the Gre@@ at P@@ aci@@ fic G@@ y@@ re .
But that &apos;s no longer an ac@@ cur@@ ate de@@ pi@@ ction of pla@@ stic pol@@ lu@@ tion in the mar@@ ine environment .
"R@@ ight now , the ocean is actually a s@@ ou@@ p of pla@@ stic de@@ br@@ is , and there &apos;s now@@ here you can go in the ocean where you wouldn &apos;t be able to find pla@@ stic parti@@ cles ."
"J@@ Y : In a pla@@ sti@@ c@@ -@@ depen@@ dent society , cu@@ tting down produ@@ ction is a good go@@ al , but it &apos;s not enough ."
And what about the wa@@ ste that &apos;s already been produ@@ ced ?
P@@ la@@ sti@@ cs take hundre@@ ds to thousands of years to bio@@ de@@ gra@@ de .
"So we thought , you know what ?"
"In@@ ste@@ ad of wai@@ ting for that gar@@ b@@ age to si@@ t there and pi@@ le up , let &apos;s find a way to bre@@ ak them down with bac@@ ter@@ ia ."
"S@@ oun@@ ds cool , right ?"
A@@ ud@@ ience : Yeah . J@@ Y : Thank you .
But we had a problem .
"You see , pla@@ sti@@ cs have very comple@@ x stru@@ ctures and are difficult to bio@@ de@@ gra@@ de ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ how , we were cu@@ ri@@ ous and hop@@ e@@ ful and still wanted to give it a go ."
"M@@ W : Wi@@ th this idea in mind , Je@@ an@@ ny and I read through some hundre@@ ds of scienti@@ fic arti@@ cles on the Inter@@ net , and we dra@@ f@@ ted a research pro@@ pos@@ al in the beginning of our gra@@ de 12 year ."
We a@@ im@@ ed to find bac@@ ter@@ ia from our local F@@ ra@@ s@@ er Ri@@ ver that can de@@ gra@@ de a har@@ m@@ ful pla@@ sti@@ ci@@ z@@ er called ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates .
"A@@ l@@ though they &apos;re part of the pla@@ stic , they &apos;re not co@@ val@@ ently b@@ on@@ ded to the pla@@ stic back@@ b@@ one ."
"As a resul@@ t , they e@@ a@@ si@@ ly es@@ cape into our environment ."
"N@@ ot only do ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates pol@@ lu@@ te our environment , but they also pol@@ lu@@ te our bod@@ ies ."
"To make the matter wor@@ se , ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates are found in produ@@ cts to which we have a high ex@@ pos@@ ure , such as b@@ ab@@ ies &apos; to@@ ys , be@@ ver@@ age con@@ tain@@ ers , co@@ s@@ me@@ ti@@ cs , and even food w@@ ra@@ ps ."
P@@ h@@ th@@ al@@ ates are hor@@ ri@@ ble because they &apos;re so e@@ a@@ si@@ ly taken into our bod@@ ies .
"They can be ab@@ sor@@ bed by sk@@ in cont@@ act , ing@@ est@@ ed , and in@@ hal@@ ed ."
"J@@ Y : E@@ very year , at least 4@@ 70 million po@@ un@@ ds of ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates cont@@ am@@ in@@ ate our air , water and so@@ il ."
"So we figu@@ red , if there are places along our F@@ ra@@ s@@ er Ri@@ ver that are cont@@ am@@ in@@ ated with ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates , and if there are bac@@ ter@@ ia that are able to live in these are@@ as , then per@@ haps , per@@ haps these bac@@ ter@@ ia could have ev@@ olved to bre@@ ak down ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates ."
"M@@ W : So we pre@@ sen@@ ted this good idea to D@@ r. L@@ in@@ d@@ say E@@ l@@ t@@ is at the Uni@@ versity of Bri@@ ti@@ sh Col@@ um@@ bi@@ a , and sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly , he actually took us into his la@@ b and asked his gra@@ du@@ ate students A@@ d@@ am and J@@ am@@ es to help us ."
L@@ it@@ tle did we know at that time that a tri@@ p to the du@@ m@@ p and some research on the Inter@@ net and p@@ lu@@ c@@ king up the cou@@ ra@@ ge to act upo@@ n in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation would take us on a li@@ fe@@ -@@ chang@@ ing jour@@ ney of ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents and disco@@ ver@@ ies .
"O@@ u@@ t of thousands of bac@@ ter@@ ia , we wanted to find ones that could bre@@ ak down ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates , so we en@@ ri@@ ched our cul@@ tu@@ res with ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates as the only car@@ b@@ on source ."
"E@@ very@@ thing went well from there , and we became amazing scienti@@ sts . ( Laughter ) M@@ W : U@@ m ... u@@ h , Je@@ an@@ ny . J@@ Y : I &apos;m just jo@@ king ."
"M@@ W : O@@ kay . Well , it was parti@@ ally my f@@ au@@ l@@ t ."
"You see , I ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally c@@ rac@@ ked the f@@ las@@ k that had con@@ ta@@ ined our third en@@ ri@@ ch@@ ment culture , and as a resul@@ t , we had to wi@@ pe down the in@@ cu@@ bat@@ or room with b@@ le@@ ach and e@@ th@@ an@@ ol t@@ wi@@ ce ."
But this mist@@ ake turned out to be rather ser@@ en@@ di@@ pit@@ ous .
"We noti@@ ced that the un@@ har@@ med cul@@ tu@@ res came from places of op@@ posi@@ te cont@@ am@@ in@@ ation le@@ v@@ els , so this mist@@ ake actually led us to think that per@@ haps we can comp@@ are the different de@@ gra@@ d@@ ative poten@@ ti@@ als of bac@@ ter@@ ia from si@@ tes of op@@ posi@@ te cont@@ am@@ in@@ ation le@@ v@@ els ."
"J@@ Y : Now that we gre@@ w the bac@@ ter@@ ia , we wanted to is@@ ol@@ ate stra@@ ins by stre@@ aking on@@ to medi@@ ate pl@@ ates , because we thought that would be less ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ -@@ pro@@ ne , but we were wrong again ."
We po@@ ked ho@@ les in our ag@@ ar while stre@@ aking and cont@@ am@@ in@@ ated some sam@@ ples and fun@@ gh@@ i .
"As a resul@@ t , we had to stre@@ ak and re@@ stre@@ ak se@@ ver@@ al times ."
This means that our bac@@ ter@@ ia were actually living off of ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates .
"We were happy to see that , al@@ though our three stra@@ ins had been pre@@ vi@@ ously iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ied bac@@ ter@@ ia , two of them were not pre@@ vi@@ ously as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with ph@@ th@@ al@@ ate de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation , so this was actually a no@@ vel disco@@ very ."
"J@@ Y : To better understand how this bio@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation works , we wanted to ver@@ i@@ fy the cat@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ c pa@@ th@@ ways of our three stra@@ ins ."
"To do this , we ex@@ trac@@ ted en@@ zy@@ mes from our bac@@ ter@@ ia and re@@ ac@@ ted with an inter@@ medi@@ ate of ph@@ th@@ ali@@ c ac@@ id ."
M@@ W : We mon@@ i@@ to@@ red this experim@@ ent with spe@@ c@@ tro@@ ph@@ ot@@ ome@@ try and ob@@ ta@@ ined this beautiful gra@@ ph .
This gra@@ ph shows that our bac@@ ter@@ ia really do have a gen@@ e@@ tic pa@@ th@@ way to bio@@ de@@ gra@@ de ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates .
"O@@ ur bac@@ ter@@ ia can trans@@ form ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates , which is a har@@ m@@ ful to@@ x@@ in , into end produ@@ cts such as car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de , water and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ."
"We were also interested to see that , al@@ though we &apos;ve ob@@ ta@@ ined gre@@ ater di@@ versity of bac@@ ter@@ ia bio@@ de@@ gra@@ ders from the bir@@ d ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at site , we ob@@ ta@@ ined the most ef@@ fi@@ cient de@@ gra@@ ders from the land@@ fi@@ ll site ."
J@@ Y : So Mi@@ ran@@ da and I sh@@ ared this research at the S@@ an@@ of@@ i Bi@@ o@@ G@@ E@@ N@@ E@@ i@@ us Ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge compe@@ ti@@ tion and were re@@ cogni@@ zed with the gre@@ at@@ est comm@@ er@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ation poten@@ tial .
"We have not only sh@@ own that bac@@ ter@@ ia can be the solution to pla@@ stic pol@@ lu@@ tion , but also that being open to un@@ certain out@@ comes and taking ri@@ sk@@ s create opportuni@@ ties for u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted disco@@ ver@@ ies ."
We can app@@ ly this to wa@@ ste@@ water tre@@ at@@ ment plan@@ ts to cle@@ an up our ri@@ ver@@ s and other natural re@@ sources .
And per@@ haps one day we &apos;ll be able to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le the problem of so@@ li@@ d pla@@ stic wa@@ ste .
Thank you . J@@ Y : Thank you .

"So a friend of m@@ ine who &apos;s a poli@@ tical scienti@@ st , he told me se@@ ver@@ al months ago exactly what this mon@@ th would be like ."
"He said , you know , there &apos;s this fi@@ sc@@ al cli@@ ff coming , it &apos;s going to come at the beginning of 20@@ 1@@ 3 ."
"B@@ ot@@ h par@@ ties absolu@@ tely need to re@@ sol@@ ve it , but ne@@ i@@ ther par@@ ty wan@@ ts to be seen as the first to re@@ sol@@ ve it ."
"N@@ either par@@ ty has any in@@ cen@@ tive to sol@@ ve it a second before it &apos;s du@@ e , so he said , De@@ c@@ em@@ ber , you &apos;re just going to see lots of ang@@ ry neg@@ oti@@ ations , neg@@ oti@@ ations bre@@ aking a@@ part , re@@ por@@ ts of phone cal@@ ls that ar@@ en &apos;t going well , people saying nothing &apos;s happening at all , and then some@@ time around Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as or New Ye@@ ar &apos;s , we &apos;re going to hear , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , they re@@ sol@@ ved everything . &quot; &quot; He told me that a few months ago . He said he &apos;s 9@@ 8 percent posi@@ tive they &apos;re going to re@@ sol@@ ve it , and I got an e@@ ma@@ il from him today saying , all right , we &apos;re basically on tr@@ ack , but now I &apos;m 80 percent posi@@ tive that they &apos;re going to re@@ sol@@ ve it ."
"And it made me think . I love stu@@ dy@@ ing these mom@@ ents in American history when there was this fr@@ en@@ zy of parti@@ s@@ an ang@@ er , that the econom@@ y was on the ver@@ ge of tot@@ al col@@ lap@@ se ."
"The most fam@@ ous early bat@@ tle was A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der H@@ am@@ il@@ ton and Th@@ om@@ as J@@ ef@@ fer@@ son over what the dol@@ lar would be and how it would be bac@@ ked up , with A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der H@@ am@@ il@@ ton saying , &quot; &quot; We need a cent@@ ral b@@ ank , the F@@ ir@@ st B@@ ank of the United States , or else the dol@@ lar will have no val@@ ue ."
"This econom@@ y won &apos;t work , &quot; &quot; and Th@@ om@@ as J@@ ef@@ fer@@ son saying , &quot; &quot; The people won &apos;t tr@@ ust that ."
"They just f@@ ou@@ ght off a king . They &apos;re not going to ac@@ cept some cent@@ ral au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty . &quot; &quot; This bat@@ tle de@@ fin@@ ed the first 1@@ 50 years of the U.@@ S. econom@@ y , and at every moment , different parti@@ s@@ ans saying , &quot; Oh my God , the econom@@ y &apos;s about to col@@ lap@@ se , &quot; and the rest of us just going about , sp@@ ending our bu@@ cks on whatever it is we wanted to bu@@ y ."
"To give you a qui@@ ck pri@@ m@@ er on where we are , a qui@@ ck re@@ fre@@ sh@@ er on where we are ."
"So the fi@@ sc@@ al cli@@ ff , I was told that that &apos;s too parti@@ s@@ an a thing to say , al@@ though I can &apos;t remember which par@@ ty it &apos;s sup@@ por@@ ting or att@@ ac@@ king ."
"P@@ e@@ ople say we should call it the fi@@ sc@@ al s@@ lo@@ pe , or we should call it an au@@ st@@ eri@@ ty cri@@ sis , but then other people say , no , that &apos;s even more parti@@ s@@ an ."
"So I just call it the self-@@ im@@ posed , self-@@ de@@ stru@@ ctive ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary de@@ ad@@ line about re@@ sol@@ ving an in@@ evi@@ table problem ."
And this is what the in@@ evi@@ table problem looks like .
"So this is a proje@@ ction of U.@@ S. de@@ b@@ t as a per@@ cent@@ age of our over@@ all econom@@ y , of G@@ D@@ P ."
"The light blue dot@@ ted line re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts the Con@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ onal Bu@@ d@@ get O@@ f@@ fi@@ ce &apos;s best gu@@ ess of what will happen if Con@@ gre@@ ss really doesn &apos;t do anything , and as you can see , some@@ time around 20@@ 2@@ 7 , we re@@ ach Gre@@ ek le@@ v@@ els of de@@ b@@ t , some@@ where around 1@@ 30 percent of G@@ D@@ P , which tel@@ ls you that some time in the next 20 years , if Con@@ gre@@ ss does absolu@@ tely nothing , we &apos;re going to h@@ it a moment where the world &apos;s inv@@ est@@ ors , the world &apos;s b@@ ond bu@@ y@@ ers , are going to say , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t tr@@ ust America any@@ more . We &apos;re not going to l@@ end them any money , ex@@ cept at really high inter@@ est r@@ ates . &quot; &quot; And at that moment our econom@@ y col@@ lap@@ ses ."
"But remember , Gre@@ e@@ ce is there today ."
"We &apos;re there in 20 years . We have lots and lots of time to av@@ o@@ id that cri@@ sis , and the fi@@ sc@@ al cli@@ ff was just one more at@@ tem@@ pt at trying to force the two si@@ des to re@@ sol@@ ve the cri@@ sis ."
Here &apos;s another way to look at exactly the same problem .
The dar@@ k blue line is how much the government sp@@ en@@ ds .
The light blue line is how much the government gets in .
"And as you can see , for most of re@@ cent history , ex@@ cept for a br@@ ie@@ f per@@ i@@ od , we have consi@@ st@@ ently spent more than we take in . Th@@ us the national de@@ b@@ t ."
"But as you can also see , proje@@ cted going forward , the ga@@ p wi@@ den@@ s a bit and ra@@ is@@ es a bit , and this gra@@ ph is only through 20@@ 2@@ 1 ."
"It gets really , really u@@ g@@ ly out towar@@ ds 20@@ 30 ."
And this gra@@ ph sort of su@@ ms up what the problem is .
"The De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s , they say , well , this isn &apos;t a big deal ."
"We can just ra@@ ise ta@@ x@@ es a bit and close that ga@@ p , es@@ pe@@ cially if we ra@@ ise ta@@ x@@ es on the ri@@ ch ."
"The Re@@ publi@@ cans say , h@@ ey , no , no , we &apos;ve got a better idea ."
Why don &apos;t we low@@ er both lin@@ es ?
"Wh@@ y don &apos;t we low@@ er government sp@@ ending and low@@ er government ta@@ x@@ es , and then we &apos;ll be on an even more fa@@ v@@ or@@ able lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m de@@ fi@@ c@@ it tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory ?"
"And behind this powerful dis@@ ag@@ re@@ ement between how to close that ga@@ p , there &apos;s the wor@@ st kind of cy@@ ni@@ cal par@@ ty poli@@ ti@@ cs , the wor@@ st kind of in@@ si@@ der bas@@ e@@ ball , lob@@ by@@ ing , all of that stuff , but there &apos;s also this power@@ fully interesting , re@@ spe@@ ct@@ ful dis@@ ag@@ re@@ ement between two fundam@@ ent@@ ally different economic phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ ies ."
"And I like to think , when I picture how Re@@ publi@@ cans see the econom@@ y , what I picture is just some amaz@@ ing@@ ly wel@@ l-@@ engine@@ er@@ ed mach@@ ine , some perfe@@ ct mach@@ ine ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , I picture it made in G@@ er@@ many or J@@ ap@@ an , but this amazing mach@@ ine that &apos;s con@@ stan@@ tly sc@@ our@@ ing every bit of human en@@ de@@ av@@ or and taking re@@ sources , money , lab@@ or , ca@@ pi@@ tal , mach@@ in@@ ery , away from the least produ@@ ctive par@@ ts and towar@@ ds the more produ@@ ctive par@@ ts , and while this might cause tem@@ por@@ ary dis@@ lo@@ cation , what it does is it buil@@ ds up the more produ@@ ctive are@@ as and le@@ ts the less produ@@ ctive are@@ as f@@ ade away and die , and as a resul@@ t the whole system is so much more ef@@ fi@@ cient , so much ri@@ ch@@ er for everybody ."
"And this view gener@@ ally belie@@ ves that there is a ro@@ le for government , a small ro@@ le , to set the ru@@ les so people ar@@ en &apos;t l@@ ying and che@@ ating and h@@ ur@@ ting each other , maybe , you know , have a poli@@ ce force and a fi@@ re de@@ part@@ ment and an ar@@ my , but to have a very li@@ mi@@ ted re@@ ach into the mechani@@ s@@ ms of this mach@@ in@@ ery ."
"And when I picture how De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s and De@@ moc@@ r@@ ati@@ c@@ -@@ le@@ an@@ ing econom@@ ist@@ s picture this econom@@ y , most De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic econom@@ ist@@ s are , you know , they &apos;re ca@@ pit@@ ali@@ sts , they believe , y@@ es , that &apos;s a good system a lot of the time ."
It &apos;s good to let marke@@ ts move re@@ sources to their more produ@@ ctive use .
But that system has t@@ ons of problems .
W@@ e@@ alth pi@@ les up in the wrong places .
W@@ e@@ alth is ri@@ pped away from people who sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be called un@@ produ@@ ctive .
"That &apos;s not going to create an equ@@ it@@ able , fa@@ ir society ."
"That mach@@ ine doesn &apos;t care about the environment , about rac@@ is@@ m , about all these issu@@ es that make this life wor@@ se for all of us , and so the government does have a ro@@ le to take re@@ sources from more produ@@ ctive uses , or from ri@@ ch@@ er sources , and give them to other sources ."
"And when you think about the econom@@ y through these two different len@@ ses , you understand why this cri@@ sis is so hard to sol@@ ve , because the wor@@ se the cri@@ sis gets , the high@@ er the st@@ ak@@ es are , the more each side thin@@ ks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ru@@ in everything ."
"And I can get really des@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing . I &apos;ve spent a lot of the last few years really de@@ pres@@ sed about this , until this year , I learned something that I felt really exci@@ ted about . I feel like it &apos;s really good news , and it &apos;s so sh@@ oc@@ king , I don &apos;t like saying it , because I think people won &apos;t believe me ."
But here &apos;s what I learned .
"The American people , taken as a whole , when it comes to these issu@@ es , to fi@@ sc@@ al issu@@ es , are moder@@ ate , pra@@ g@@ m@@ atic cent@@ ri@@ sts ."
"And I know that &apos;s hard to believe , that the American people are moder@@ ate , pra@@ g@@ m@@ atic cent@@ ri@@ sts ."
But let me expla@@ in what I &apos;m thinking .
"When you look at how the fe@@ der@@ al government sp@@ en@@ ds money , so this is the bat@@ tle right here , 5@@ 5 percent , more than half , is on S@@ o@@ cial Se@@ cu@@ ri@@ ty , Me@@ di@@ care , Me@@ di@@ ca@@ id , a few other health progra@@ ms , 20 percent def@@ en@@ se , 1@@ 9 percent di@@ scre@@ tion@@ ary , and six percent inter@@ est ."
"So when we &apos;re talking about cu@@ tting government sp@@ ending , this is the p@@ ie we &apos;re talking about , and Ameri@@ cans over@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly , and it doesn &apos;t matter what par@@ ty they &apos;re in , over@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly like that big 5@@ 5 percent ch@@ un@@ k ."
They like S@@ o@@ cial Se@@ cu@@ ri@@ ty . They like Me@@ di@@ care .
"They even like Me@@ di@@ ca@@ id , even though that goes to the po@@ or and indi@@ g@@ ent , which you might think would have less sup@@ port ."
"And they do not want it fundam@@ ent@@ ally tou@@ ched , al@@ though the American people are re@@ mark@@ ably comfor@@ table , and De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s rou@@ gh@@ ly equ@@ al to Re@@ publi@@ cans , with some min@@ or t@@ we@@ ak@@ s to make the system more st@@ able ."
S@@ o@@ cial Se@@ cu@@ ri@@ ty is fa@@ ir@@ ly e@@ asy to fi@@ x .
The ru@@ mor@@ s of its demi@@ se are always gre@@ at@@ ly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
"So gra@@ du@@ ally ra@@ ise S@@ o@@ cial Se@@ cu@@ ri@@ ty re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment age , maybe only on people not yet born ."
"A@@ m@@ eri@@ cans are about 50 / 50 , whether they &apos;re De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s or Re@@ publi@@ cans ."
"R@@ edu@@ ce Me@@ di@@ care for very we@@ al@@ th@@ y s@@ eni@@ ors , s@@ eni@@ ors who make a lot of money . D@@ on &apos;t even e@@ li@@ min@@ ate it . J@@ ust redu@@ ce it ."
"P@@ e@@ ople gener@@ ally are comfor@@ table with it , De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s and Re@@ publi@@ cans ."
R@@ a@@ ise medi@@ cal health care con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions ?
"E@@ very@@ one h@@ ates that equ@@ ally , but Re@@ publi@@ cans and De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s h@@ ate that together ."
"And so what this tel@@ ls me is , when you look at the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion of how to re@@ sol@@ ve our fi@@ sc@@ al problems , we are not a n@@ ation that &apos;s power@@ fully di@@ vi@@ ded on the major , major issue ."
"We &apos;re comfor@@ table with it ne@@ e@@ ding some t@@ we@@ ak@@ s , but we want to keep it ."
We &apos;re not open to a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion of e@@ li@@ min@@ ating it .
"Now there is one issue that is hy@@ per@@ -@@ parti@@ s@@ an , and where there is one par@@ ty that is just spend , spend , spend , we don &apos;t care , spend some more , and that of course is Re@@ publi@@ cans when it comes to mi@@ lit@@ ary def@@ en@@ se sp@@ ending ."
They way out@@ we@@ i@@ gh De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s .
The v@@ ast maj@@ ori@@ ty want to prote@@ ct mi@@ lit@@ ary def@@ en@@ se sp@@ ending .
"That &apos;s 20 percent of the bud@@ get , and that pre@@ sen@@ ts a more difficult issue ."
"I should also not@@ e that the &#91; di@@ scre@@ tion@@ ary &#93; sp@@ ending , which is about 1@@ 9 percent of the bud@@ get , that is De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic and Re@@ publi@@ can issu@@ es , so you do have wel@@ f@@ are , food st@@ am@@ ps , other progra@@ ms that ten@@ d to be popul@@ ar am@@ ong De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s , but you also have the far@@ m bi@@ ll and all sor@@ ts of De@@ part@@ ment of Inter@@ i@@ or indu@@ c@@ em@@ ents for oil dri@@ l@@ ling and other things , which ten@@ d to be popul@@ ar am@@ ong Re@@ publi@@ cans ."
"Now when it comes to ta@@ x@@ es , there is more dis@@ ag@@ re@@ ement ."
That &apos;s a more parti@@ s@@ an area .
"You have De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s over@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly sup@@ por@@ tive of ra@@ is@@ ing the in@@ come ta@@ x on people who make 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 dollars a year , Re@@ publi@@ cans sort of against it , al@@ though if you bre@@ ak it out by in@@ come , Re@@ publi@@ cans who make less than 7@@ 5@@ ,000 dollars a year like this idea ."
"So basically Re@@ publi@@ cans who make more than 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 dollars a year don &apos;t want to be ta@@ x@@ ed ."
"R@@ a@@ is@@ ing ta@@ x@@ es on inv@@ est@@ ment in@@ come , you also see about two th@@ ir@@ ds of De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s but only one third of Re@@ publi@@ cans are comfor@@ table with that idea ."
"This br@@ ings up a really important point , which is that we ten@@ d in this country to talk about De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s and Re@@ publi@@ cans and think there &apos;s this little group over there called in@@ depen@@ d@@ ents that &apos;s , what , two percent ?"
"If you ad@@ d De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s , you ad@@ d Re@@ publi@@ cans , you &apos;ve got the American people ."
But that is not the case at all .
And it has not been the case for most of moder@@ n American history .
R@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly a third of Ameri@@ cans say that they are De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s .
A@@ round a qu@@ ar@@ ter say that they are Re@@ publi@@ cans .
"A t@@ iny little sli@@ ver call themselves li@@ ber@@ t@@ ari@@ ans , or so@@ ci@@ ali@@ sts , or some other small third par@@ ty , and the largest blo@@ ck , 40 percent , say they &apos;re in@@ depen@@ d@@ ents ."
"So most Ameri@@ cans are not parti@@ s@@ an , and most of the people in the in@@ depen@@ dent cam@@ p f@@ all some@@ where in between , so even though we have tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous over@@ la@@ p between the vie@@ ws on these fi@@ sc@@ al issu@@ es of De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s and Re@@ publi@@ cans , we have even more over@@ la@@ p when you ad@@ d in the in@@ depen@@ d@@ ents ."
Now we get to fi@@ ght about all sor@@ ts of other issu@@ es .
"We get to h@@ ate each other on gu@@ n control and ab@@ or@@ tion and the environment , but on these fi@@ sc@@ al issu@@ es , these important fi@@ sc@@ al issu@@ es , we just are not any@@ where ne@@ ar@@ ly as di@@ vi@@ ded as people say ."
"And in fact , there &apos;s this other group of people who are not as di@@ vi@@ ded as people might think , and that group is econom@@ ist@@ s ."
"I talk to a lot of econom@@ ist@@ s , and back in the &apos; 7@@ 0s and &apos; 8@@ 0s it was u@@ g@@ ly being an econ@@ omi@@ st ."
"You were in what they called the s@@ al@@ tw@@ ater cam@@ p , me@@ an@@ ing H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , P@@ r@@ in@@ ce@@ ton , M@@ I@@ T , St@@ an@@ for@@ d , B@@ er@@ k@@ ele@@ y , or you were in the fre@@ sh@@ water cam@@ p , Uni@@ versity of Chi@@ ca@@ go , Uni@@ versity of Ro@@ ch@@ est@@ er ."
"You were a f@@ ree market ca@@ pit@@ ali@@ st econ@@ omi@@ st or you were a K@@ ey@@ ne@@ si@@ an li@@ ber@@ al econ@@ omi@@ st , and these people didn &apos;t go to each other &apos;s we@@ dd@@ ings , they s@@ nu@@ b@@ bed each other at con@@ fer@@ ences ."
"It &apos;s still u@@ g@@ ly to this day , but in my experience , it is really , really hard to find an econ@@ omi@@ st under 40 who still has that kind of way of seeing the world ."
The v@@ ast maj@@ ori@@ ty of econom@@ ist@@ s — it is so un@@ cool to call yourself an ide@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ e of either cam@@ p .
"The ph@@ ra@@ se that you want , if you &apos;re a gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent or a post@@ do@@ c or you &apos;re a prof@@ ess@@ or , a 3@@ 8@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old econ@@ omi@@ cs prof@@ ess@@ or , is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m an em@@ pi@@ ri@@ ci@@ st ."
I go by the data . &quot; &quot; And the data is very clear .
N@@ one of these major the@@ or@@ ies have been completely suc@@ cess@@ ful .
"The 20@@ th century , the last hundre@@ d years , is ri@@ dd@@ led with disa@@ st@@ rou@@ s exam@@ ples of times that one school or the other tr@@ ied to expla@@ in the past or pre@@ di@@ ct the future and just did an aw@@ ful , aw@@ ful job , so the econ@@ omi@@ cs prof@@ es@@ sion has ac@@ qui@@ red some de@@ gre@@ e of mode@@ sty ."
"They still are an aw@@ fully ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant group of people , I will as@@ sure you , but they &apos;re now ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant about their im@@ parti@@ ality , and they , too , see a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous r@@ ange of poten@@ tial out@@ comes ."
"And this n@@ on@@ parti@@ s@@ an@@ ship is something that ex@@ ist@@ s , that has ex@@ ist@@ ed in se@@ cre@@ t in America for years and years and years ."
"I &apos;ve spent a lot of the f@@ all talking to the three major organiz@@ ations that sur@@ v@@ ey American poli@@ tical at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des : Pe@@ w R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch , the Uni@@ versity of Chi@@ ca@@ go &apos;s N@@ ational O@@ p@@ ini@@ on R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch C@@ enter , and the most important but the least known is the American N@@ ational E@@ le@@ ction S@@ tu@@ d@@ ies group that is the world &apos;s lon@@ gest , most re@@ spe@@ cted po@@ ll of poli@@ tical at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des ."
"They &apos;ve been doing it since 19@@ 4@@ 8 , and what they show consi@@ st@@ ently throu@@ gh@@ out is that it &apos;s almost im@@ possible to find Ameri@@ cans who are consi@@ st@@ ent ide@@ ologi@@ cally , who consi@@ st@@ ently sup@@ port , &quot; &quot; No we mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t ta@@ x , and we must lim@@ it the size of government , &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot; No , we must en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge government to play a lar@@ ger ro@@ le in re@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion and cor@@ re@@ cting the il@@ ls of ca@@ pit@@ ali@@ sm . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose grou@@ ps are very , very small ."
"The v@@ ast maj@@ ori@@ ty of people , they pi@@ ck and cho@@ ose , they see com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se and they change over time when they hear a better ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent or a wor@@ se ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent ."
And that part of it has not changed .
What has changed is how people re@@ spo@@ nd to v@@ ag@@ ue questions .
"If you ask people v@@ ag@@ ue questions , like , &quot; Do you think there should be more government or less government ? &quot;"
&quot; &quot; Do you think government should &quot; &quot; — es@@ pe@@ cially if you use lo@@ ad@@ ed language — &quot; Do you think the government should provi@@ de hand@@ ou@@ ts ? &quot;
"O@@ r , &quot; &quot; Do you think the government should re@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ te ? &quot; &quot; Th@@ en you can see radi@@ cal parti@@ s@@ an change ."
"But when you get speci@@ fic , when you actually ask about the ac@@ tu@@ al ta@@ x@@ ing and sp@@ ending issu@@ es under consi@@ der@@ ation , people are re@@ mark@@ ably cent@@ ri@@ st , they &apos;re re@@ mark@@ ably open to com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se ."
"So what we have , then , when you think about the fi@@ sc@@ al cli@@ ff , don &apos;t think of it as the American people fundam@@ ent@@ ally can &apos;t stand each other on these issu@@ es and that we must be ri@@ pped a@@ part into two se@@ par@@ ate war@@ ring n@@ ations ."
"Th@@ in@@ k of it as a t@@ iny , t@@ iny number of an@@ cient econom@@ ist@@ s and mis@@ re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative ide@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ es have cap@@ tu@@ red the process ."
"And they &apos;ve cap@@ tu@@ red the process through fami@@ li@@ ar ways , through a pri@@ mar@@ y system which en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ges that small group of people &apos;s vo@@ i@@ ces , because that small group of people , the people who answer all y@@ es@@ es or all no@@ es on those ide@@ ologi@@ cal questions , they might be small but every one of them has a blo@@ g , every one of them has been on F@@ o@@ x or M@@ S@@ N@@ B@@ C in the last week ."
"E@@ very one of them be@@ comes a l@@ ou@@ der and l@@ ou@@ der vo@@ ice , but they don &apos;t re@@ present us ."
They don &apos;t re@@ present what our vie@@ ws are .
"And that gets me back to the dol@@ lar , and it gets me back to re@@ min@@ ding myself that we know this experience ."
"We know what it &apos;s like to have these people on T@@ V , in Con@@ gre@@ ss , y@@ el@@ ling about how the end of the world is coming if we don &apos;t ad@@ op@@ t their view completely , because it &apos;s happened about the dol@@ lar ever since there &apos;s been a dol@@ lar ."
We had the bat@@ tle between J@@ ef@@ fer@@ son and H@@ am@@ il@@ ton .
"In 19@@ 1@@ 3 , we had this u@@ g@@ ly bat@@ tle over the F@@ e@@ der@@ al R@@ es@@ er@@ ve , when it was created , with vi@@ ci@@ ous , ang@@ ry ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents over how it would be con@@ stitu@@ ted , and a gener@@ al ag@@ re@@ ement that the way it was con@@ stitu@@ ted was the wor@@ st possible com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se , a com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to de@@ stro@@ y this val@@ u@@ able thing , this dol@@ lar , but then everyone ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing , o@@ kay , so long as we &apos;re on the g@@ old stan@@ d@@ ard , it should be o@@ kay ."
The F@@ ed can &apos;t m@@ ess it up so bad@@ ly .
But then we got off the g@@ old stan@@ d@@ ard for individu@@ als during the De@@ pres@@ sion and we got off the g@@ old stan@@ d@@ ard as a source of inter@@ national cur@@ ren@@ cy co@@ ordin@@ ation during Ri@@ ch@@ ard Ni@@ x@@ on &apos;s pre@@ si@@ den@@ cy .
"E@@ ach of those times , we were on the ver@@ ge of comple@@ te col@@ lap@@ se ."
And nothing happened at all .
"Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out it all , the dol@@ lar has been one of the most lon@@ g@@ -@@ standing , st@@ able , reas@@ on@@ able cur@@ ren@@ cies , and we all use it every single day , no matter what the people scre@@ am@@ ing about tell us , no matter how sc@@ ared we &apos;re sup@@ posed to be ."
"And this lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m fi@@ sc@@ al picture that we &apos;re in right now , I think what is most m@@ ad@@ den@@ ing about it is , if Con@@ gre@@ ss were simply able to show not that they ag@@ ree with each other , not that they &apos;re able to come up with the best possible com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se , but that they are able to just beg@@ in the process towar@@ ds com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se , we all in@@ stan@@ tly are better off ."
The fe@@ ar is that the world is wat@@ ching .
"The fe@@ ar is that the longer we de@@ l@@ ay any solution , the more the world will look to the U.@@ S@@ ."
"@@ not as the be@@ dro@@ ck of st@@ ability in the global econom@@ y , but as a place that can &apos;t re@@ sol@@ ve its own fi@@ ghts , and the longer we put that off , the more we make the world ner@@ v@@ ous , the high@@ er inter@@ est r@@ ates are going to be , the quick@@ er we &apos;re going to have to face a day of hor@@ ri@@ ble cal@@ ami@@ ty ."
"And so just the act of com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se itself , and susta@@ ined , real com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se , would give us even more time , would al@@ low both si@@ des even longer to sp@@ read out the pa@@ in and re@@ ach even more com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se down the ro@@ ad ."
"So I &apos;m in the media . I feel like my job to make this happen is to help f@@ ost@@ er the things that se@@ em to le@@ ad to com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se , to not talk about this in those v@@ ag@@ ue and sc@@ ary terms that do po@@ lar@@ i@@ ze us , but to just talk about it like what it is , not an ex@@ ist@@ enti@@ al cri@@ sis , not some bat@@ tle between two fundam@@ ent@@ ally different religi@@ ous vie@@ ws , but a mat@@ h problem , a really sol@@ v@@ able mat@@ h problem , one where we &apos;re not all going to get what we want and one where , you know , there &apos;s going to be a little pa@@ in to sp@@ read around ."
"But the more we ad@@ dre@@ ss it as a prac@@ tical con@@ cer@@ n , the so@@ on@@ er we can re@@ sol@@ ve it , and the more time we have to re@@ sol@@ ve it , par@@ ad@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ cally ."
Thank you . ( Applause )
"M@@ usi@@ c is not the only kind of sound , h@@ ow@@ ever , which af@@ fe@@ cts your emoti@@ ons ."
"And whatever number you &apos;re thinking of , it probably isn &apos;t as bad as this ."
I &apos;ll give you two exam@@ ples .
"That &apos;s an order of mag@@ ni@@ tu@@ de , up or down ."
"Th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , make it val@@ u@@ able ."
So my fre@@ sh@@ man year of colle@@ ge I sig@@ ned up for an inter@@ n@@ ship in the h@@ ous@@ ing uni@@ t at Gre@@ ater B@@ ost@@ on Le@@ g@@ al S@@ er@@ vi@@ ces .
"S@@ h@@ ow@@ ed up the first day ready to make co@@ f@@ fe@@ e and ph@@ ot@@ oc@@ op@@ ies , but was pa@@ i@@ red with this ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , de@@ e@@ ply inspi@@ red at@@ tor@@ ney na@@ med J@@ ef@@ f P@@ ur@@ cell , who th@@ r@@ ust me on@@ to the front lin@@ es from the very first day ."
"And over the course of n@@ ine months I had the ch@@ ance to have do@@ z@@ ens of convers@@ ations with low@@ -@@ in@@ come fam@@ il@@ ies in B@@ ost@@ on who would come in pres@@ ent@@ ing with h@@ ous@@ ing issu@@ es , but always had an under@@ l@@ ying health issue ."
"So I had a cl@@ ien@@ t who came in , about to be evi@@ cted because he ha@@ sn &apos;t pa@@ id his r@@ ent ."
"But he ha@@ sn &apos;t pa@@ id his r@@ ent , of course , because he &apos;s pa@@ ying for his HIV medi@@ cation and just can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d both ."
"We had mom@@ s who would come in , d@@ aughter has as@@ th@@ ma , wa@@ k@@ es up co@@ vered in co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach@@ es every morning ."
And one of our li@@ ti@@ g@@ ation strate@@ g@@ ies was actually to sen@@ d me into the home of these cl@@ ien@@ ts with these large gl@@ as@@ s bot@@ t@@ les .
"And I would colle@@ ct the co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach@@ es , ho@@ t g@@ lu@@ e-@@ gu@@ n them to this post@@ er bo@@ ard that we &apos;d bring to cour@@ t for our c@@ ases ."
And we always won because the ju@@ d@@ ges were just so gro@@ s@@ sed out .
"F@@ ar more effe@@ ctive , I have to say , than anything I later learned in la@@ w school ."
"But over the course of these n@@ ine months , I gre@@ w f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated with feeling like we were inter@@ ven@@ ing too far dow@@ n@@ stre@@ am in the lives of our cl@@ ien@@ ts — that by the time they came to us , they were already in cri@@ sis ."
"And at the end of my fre@@ sh@@ man year of colle@@ ge , I read an arti@@ cle about the work that D@@ r. Bar@@ ry Z@@ u@@ ck@@ er@@ man was doing as C@@ ha@@ ir of Pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ cs at B@@ ost@@ on Me@@ di@@ cal C@@ enter ."
And his first hi@@ re was a leg@@ al ser@@ vi@@ ces at@@ tor@@ ney to re@@ present the patients .
"So I called Bar@@ ry , and with his bl@@ ess@@ ing , in O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 199@@ 5 wal@@ ked into the wai@@ ting room of the pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ cs c@@ lin@@ ic at B@@ ost@@ on Me@@ di@@ cal C@@ enter ."
"I &apos;ll never for@@ get , the T@@ V@@ s pla@@ yed this en@@ d@@ less re@@ el of car@@ to@@ ons ."
"And the ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sti@@ on of mo@@ thers who had taken two , three , sometimes four bus@@ es to bring their child to the do@@ ctor was just pal@@ p@@ able ."
"The do@@ ct@@ ors , it seem@@ ed , never really had enough time for all the patients , try as they might ."
"And over the course of six months , I would cor@@ ner them in the hal@@ l@@ way and ask them a sort of na@@ i@@ ve but fundam@@ ent@@ al question : &quot; &quot; If you had un@@ li@@ mi@@ ted re@@ sources , what &apos;s the one thing you would give your patients ? &quot; &quot; And I heard the same story again and again , a story we &apos;ve heard hundre@@ ds of times since then ."
"They said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very day we have patients that come into the c@@ lin@@ ic — child has an e@@ ar in@@ fe@@ ction , I pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ be anti@@ bi@@ oti@@ cs ."
But the real issue is there &apos;s no food at home .
The real issue is that child is living with 12 other people in a two@@ -@@ be@@ dro@@ om a@@ part@@ ment .
And I don &apos;t even ask about those issu@@ es because there &apos;s nothing I can do .
I have 1@@ 3 minutes with each patien@@ t .
P@@ at@@ ien@@ ts are pi@@ ling up in the c@@ lin@@ ic wai@@ ting room .
I have no idea where the ne@@ ar@@ est food pan@@ try is .
"And I don &apos;t even have any help . &quot; &quot; In that c@@ lin@@ ic , even today , there are two social wor@@ k@@ ers for 2@@ 4@@ ,000 pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ c patients , which is better than a lot of the c@@ lini@@ cs out there ."
"So H@@ e@@ alth Le@@ ads was born of these convers@@ ations — a simple model where do@@ ct@@ ors and n@@ ur@@ ses can pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ be n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ti@@ ous food , he@@ at in the win@@ ter and other basi@@ c re@@ sources for their patients the same way they pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ be medi@@ cation ."
P@@ at@@ ien@@ ts then take their pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tions to our des@@ k in the c@@ lin@@ ic wai@@ ting room where we have a cor@@ e of wel@@ l-@@ tra@@ ined colle@@ ge stud@@ ent adv@@ oc@@ ates who work side by side with these fam@@ il@@ ies to conne@@ ct them out to the ex@@ ist@@ ing land@@ s@@ cape of community re@@ sources .
So we began with a car@@ d table in the c@@ lin@@ ic wai@@ ting room — tot@@ ally le@@ mon@@ ade stand sty@@ le .
"But today we have a thous@@ and colle@@ ge stud@@ ent adv@@ oc@@ ates who are working to conne@@ ct ne@@ ar@@ ly 9@@ ,000 patients and their fam@@ il@@ ies with the re@@ sources that they need to be health@@ y ."
So 18 months ago I got this e@@ ma@@ il that changed my life .
"And the e@@ ma@@ il was from D@@ r. J@@ ack G@@ ei@@ ger , who had wri@@ t@@ ten to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate me on H@@ e@@ alth Le@@ ads and to share , as he said , a bit of histori@@ cal con@@ te@@ xt ."
"In 19@@ 6@@ 5 D@@ r. G@@ ei@@ ger f@@ oun@@ ded one of the first two community health cen@@ ters in this country , in a bru@@ t@@ ally po@@ or area in the M@@ is@@ si@@ s@@ si@@ pp@@ i D@@ el@@ ta ."
And so many of his patients came in pres@@ ent@@ ing with mal@@ n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion that be began pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ ing food for them .
"And they would take these pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tions to the local super@@ market , which would fi@@ ll them and then char@@ ge the ph@@ ar@@ m@@ acy bud@@ get of the c@@ lin@@ ic ."
"And when the O@@ f@@ fi@@ ce of E@@ con@@ om@@ ic O@@ p@@ portuni@@ ty in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . — which was fun@@ ding G@@ ei@@ ger &apos;s c@@ lin@@ ic — found out about this , they were fu@@ ri@@ ous ."
"And they s@@ ent this bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ r@@ at down to tell G@@ ei@@ ger that he was expe@@ cted to use their dollars for medi@@ cal care — to which G@@ ei@@ ger fam@@ ously and logi@@ cally respon@@ ded , &quot; &quot; The last time I che@@ cked my te@@ x@@ t@@ boo@@ ks , the speci@@ fic ther@@ ap@@ y for mal@@ n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion was food . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So when I got this e@@ ma@@ il from D@@ r. G@@ ei@@ ger , I knew I was sup@@ posed to be pro@@ u@@ d to be part of this history ."
But the tru@@ th is I was de@@ v@@ ast@@ ated .
"H@@ ere we are , 4@@ 5 years after G@@ ei@@ ger has pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed food for his patients , and I have do@@ ct@@ ors tel@@ ling me , &quot; O@@ n those issu@@ es , we prac@@ ti@@ ce a &apos; don &apos;t ask , don &apos;t tell &apos; poli@@ cy . &quot;"
"F@@ or@@ ty@@ -@@ five years after G@@ ei@@ ger , H@@ e@@ alth Le@@ ads has to re@@ inv@@ ent the pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ption for basi@@ c re@@ sources ."
So I have spent hours upo@@ n hours trying to make sense of this we@@ ird G@@ ro@@ un@@ d@@ ho@@ g D@@ ay .
"H@@ ow is it that if for de@@ ca@@ des we had a pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward to@@ ol for ke@@ e@@ ping patients , and es@@ pe@@ cially low@@ -@@ in@@ come patients , health@@ y , that we didn &apos;t use it ?"
"If we know what it takes to have a health@@ care system rather than a si@@ ck@@ -@@ care system , why don &apos;t we just do it ?"
"These questions , in my mind , are not hard because the ans@@ w@@ ers are comp@@ lic@@ ated , they are hard because they requi@@ re that we be hon@@ est with ourselves ."
"My belie@@ f is that it &apos;s almost too pain@@ ful to arti@@ cul@@ ate our as@@ pi@@ r@@ ations for our health@@ care system , or even ad@@ m@@ it that we have any at all ."
"Because if we did , they would be so re@@ mo@@ ved from our cur@@ r@@ ent re@@ ality ."
"But that doesn &apos;t change my belie@@ f that all of us , de@@ ep inside , here in this room and across this country , share a si@@ mi@@ lar set of de@@ si@@ res ."
"That if we are hon@@ est with ourselves and list@@ en qu@@ ie@@ tly , that we all har@@ b@@ or one f@@ ier@@ ce@@ ly he@@ ld as@@ pi@@ r@@ ation for our health@@ care : that it keep us health@@ y ."
This as@@ pi@@ r@@ ation that our health@@ care keep us health@@ y is an en@@ or@@ m@@ ously powerful one .
And the way I think about this is that health@@ care is like any other system .
It &apos;s just a set of cho@@ i@@ ces that people make .
What if we decided to make a different set of cho@@ i@@ ces ?
"What if we decided to take all the par@@ ts of health@@ care that have dri@@ f@@ ted away from us and stand fir@@ m and say , &quot; &quot; No ."
These things are ours .
They will be used for our pur@@ pos@@ es .
They will be used to realize our as@@ pi@@ r@@ ation &quot; &quot; ?
What if everything we needed to realize our as@@ pi@@ r@@ ation for health@@ care was right there in front of us just wai@@ ting to be c@@ la@@ im@@ ed ?
So that &apos;s where H@@ e@@ alth Le@@ ads began .
"We started with the pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ption p@@ ad — a very ordin@@ ary piece of pa@@ per — and we asked , not what do patients need to get health@@ y — anti@@ bi@@ oti@@ cs , an in@@ hal@@ er , medi@@ cation — but what do patients need to be health@@ y , to not get si@@ ck in the first place ?"
And we cho@@ se to use the pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ption for that pur@@ pos@@ e .
"So just a few miles from here at Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s N@@ ational Me@@ di@@ cal C@@ enter , when patients come into the do@@ ctor &apos;s offi@@ ce , they &apos;re asked a few questions ."
"They &apos;re asked , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you ru@@ n@@ ning out of food at the end of the mon@@ th ?"
"D@@ o you have sa@@ fe h@@ ous@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; And when the do@@ ctor begin@@ s the visi@@ t , she know@@ s he@@ ight , we@@ ight , is there food at home , is the family living in a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"And that not only le@@ ads to a better set of c@@ lini@@ cal cho@@ i@@ ces , but the do@@ ctor can also pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ be those re@@ sources for the patien@@ t , using H@@ e@@ alth Le@@ ads like any other sub@@ -@@ speci@@ al@@ ty re@@ fer@@ ral ."
"The problem is , once you get a ta@@ ste of what it &apos;s like to realize your as@@ pi@@ r@@ ation for health@@ care , you want more ."
"So we thought , if we can get individu@@ al do@@ ct@@ ors to pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ be these basi@@ c re@@ sources for their patients , could we get an entire health@@ care system to shi@@ ft its pre@@ sum@@ ption ?"
And we gave it a sh@@ ot .
"So now at H@@ ar@@ lem H@@ o@@ spit@@ al C@@ enter when patients come in with an ele@@ v@@ ated body mas@@ s in@@ de@@ x , the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic medi@@ cal recor@@ d au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally gener@@ ates a pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ption for H@@ e@@ alth Le@@ ads ."
And our vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers can then work with them to conne@@ ct patients to health@@ y food and ex@@ cer@@ ci@@ se progra@@ ms in their communi@@ ties .
"We &apos;ve created a pre@@ sum@@ ption that if you &apos;re a patien@@ t at that ho@@ spit@@ al with an ele@@ v@@ ated B@@ M@@ I , the four wal@@ ls of the do@@ ctor &apos;s offi@@ ce probably ar@@ en &apos;t going to give you everything you need to be health@@ y ."
You need more .
"So on the one hand , this is just a basi@@ c re@@ c@@ od@@ ing of the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic medi@@ cal recor@@ d ."
"And on the other hand , it &apos;s a radi@@ cal trans@@ form@@ ation of the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic medi@@ cal recor@@ d from a st@@ atic re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of di@@ ag@@ no@@ stic information to a health pro@@ moti@@ on to@@ ol ."
"In the pri@@ v@@ ate se@@ ctor , when you squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze that kind of ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal val@@ ue out of a fi@@ x@@ ed@@ -@@ cost inv@@ est@@ ment , it &apos;s called a bi@@ lli@@ on-@@ dol@@ lar company ."
"But in my world , it &apos;s called redu@@ ced obe@@ sity and di@@ a@@ be@@ tes ."
"It &apos;s called health@@ care — a system where do@@ ct@@ ors can pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ be solu@@ tions to impro@@ ve health , not just man@@ age dise@@ ase ."
S@@ ame thing in the c@@ lin@@ ic wai@@ ting room .
"So every day in this country three million patients pas@@ s through about 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 c@@ lin@@ ic wai@@ ting ro@@ oms in this country ."
And what do they do when they &apos;re there ?
"They si@@ t , they wat@@ ch the g@@ ol@@ d@@ fish in the fish t@@ ank , they read extre@@ me@@ ly old cop@@ ies of Go@@ od H@@ ou@@ se@@ ke@@ e@@ ping mag@@ az@@ ine ."
"But mo@@ st@@ ly we all just si@@ t there fore@@ ver , wai@@ ting ."
How did we get here where we de@@ v@@ ot@@ e hundre@@ ds of ac@@ res and thousands of hours to wai@@ ting ?
"What if we had a wai@@ ting room where you don &apos;t just si@@ t when you &apos;re si@@ ck , but where you go to get health@@ y ."
"If air@@ por@@ ts can become sh@@ op@@ ping mal@@ ls and M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s can become pla@@ y@@ gro@@ un@@ ds , su@@ re@@ ly we can re@@ inv@@ ent the c@@ lin@@ ic wai@@ ting room ."
"And that &apos;s what H@@ e@@ alth Le@@ ads has tr@@ ied to do , to re@@ c@@ la@@ im that real est@@ ate and that time and to use it as a g@@ ate@@ way to conne@@ ct patients to the re@@ sources they need to be health@@ y ."
"So it &apos;s a bru@@ tal win@@ ter in the Nor@@ the@@ ast , your kid has as@@ th@@ ma , your he@@ at just got turned off , and of course you &apos;re in the wai@@ ting room of the E@@ R , because the c@@ old air tri@@ gg@@ er@@ ed your child &apos;s as@@ th@@ ma ."
"But what if instead of wai@@ ting for hours an@@ x@@ i@@ ously , the wai@@ ting room became the place where H@@ e@@ alth Le@@ ads turned your he@@ at back on ?"
And of course all of this requi@@ res a bro@@ a@@ der wor@@ k@@ force .
"But if we &apos;re cre@@ ative , we already have that too ."
"We know that our do@@ ct@@ ors and n@@ ur@@ ses and even social wor@@ k@@ ers ar@@ en &apos;t enough , that the ti@@ c@@ king minutes of health care are too con@@ stra@@ ining ."
H@@ e@@ alth just takes more time .
It requi@@ res a n@@ on-@@ c@@ lini@@ cal ar@@ my of community health wor@@ k@@ ers and case man@@ ag@@ ers and many others .
What if a small part of that next health@@ care wor@@ k@@ force were the 11 million colle@@ ge students in this country ?
"U@@ n@@ en@@ cu@@ m@@ ber@@ ed by c@@ lini@@ cal respon@@ si@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies , un@@ wil@@ ling to take no for an answer from those bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ rac@@ ies that ten@@ d to c@@ rus@@ h patients , and with an un@@ par@@ al@@ le@@ led ability for information re@@ tr@@ ie@@ v@@ al hon@@ ed through years of using Go@@ og@@ le ."
"Now l@@ est you think it im@@ prob@@ able that a colle@@ ge vol@@ un@@ te@@ er can make this kind of com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment , I have two words for you : Mar@@ ch M@@ ad@@ ness ."
The a@@ ver@@ age N@@ C@@ A@@ A D@@ i@@ vision I men &apos;s bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball pla@@ y@@ er de@@ di@@ c@@ ates 3@@ 9 hours a week to his spor@@ t .
"Now we may think that &apos;s good or bad , but in either case it &apos;s real ."
And H@@ e@@ alth Le@@ ads is based on the pre@@ sum@@ ption that for too long we have asked too little of our colle@@ ge students when it comes to real impac@@ t in v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able communi@@ ties .
"C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge spor@@ ts te@@ am@@ s say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to take do@@ z@@ ens of hours at some fie@@ ld across cam@@ pu@@ s at some un@@ god@@ ly hour of the morning and we &apos;re going to meas@@ ure your perform@@ ance , and your team &apos;s perform@@ ance , and if you don &apos;t meas@@ ure up or you don &apos;t show up , we &apos;re going to cut you off the team ."
"But we &apos;ll make huge inv@@ est@@ ments in your tra@@ ining and develo@@ pment , and we &apos;ll give you an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary community of pe@@ ers . &quot; &quot; And people line up out the door just for the ch@@ ance to be part of it ."
"So our feeling is , if it &apos;s good enough for the ru@@ g@@ by team , it &apos;s good enough for health and po@@ ver@@ ty ."
"H@@ e@@ alth Le@@ ads too re@@ c@@ ru@@ its compe@@ ti@@ ti@@ vely , tra@@ ins inten@@ si@@ vely , co@@ ach@@ es prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ ally , de@@ man@@ ds sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant time , buil@@ ds a co@@ he@@ sive team and meas@@ ures resul@@ ts — a kind of T@@ each for America for health@@ care ."
Now in the top 10 cities in the U.@@ S.
"@@ with the largest number of Me@@ di@@ ca@@ id patients , each of those has at least 20@@ ,000 colle@@ ge students ."
New York alone has half a million colle@@ ge students .
"And this isn &apos;t just a sort of shor@@ t-@@ ter@@ m wor@@ k@@ force to conne@@ ct patients to basi@@ c re@@ sources , it &apos;s a next gener@@ ation health@@ care le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship pi@@ pe@@ line who &apos;ve spent two , three , four years in the c@@ lin@@ ic wai@@ ting room talking to patients about their most basi@@ c health needs ."
"And they leave with the con@@ vi@@ ction , the ability and the ef@@ fi@@ c@@ acy to realize our most basi@@ c as@@ pi@@ r@@ ations for health care ."
"And the thing is , there &apos;s thousands of these fol@@ ks already out there ."
"So M@@ ia L@@ o@@ zad@@ a is Ch@@ ie@@ f Re@@ si@@ dent of Inter@@ na@@ l Me@@ di@@ cine at U@@ C@@ S@@ F Me@@ di@@ cal C@@ enter , but for three years as an under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate she was a H@@ e@@ alth Le@@ ads vol@@ un@@ te@@ er in the c@@ lin@@ ic wai@@ ting room at B@@ ost@@ on Me@@ di@@ cal C@@ enter ."
"M@@ ia says , &quot; &quot; When my clas@@ s@@ mat@@ es write a pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ption , they think their work is done ."
"When I write a pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ption , I think , can the family read the pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ption ?"
Do they have transpor@@ tation to the ph@@ ar@@ m@@ acy ?
Do they have food to take with the pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ption ?
Do they have in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce to fi@@ ll the pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ption ?
"Th@@ ose are the questions I learned at H@@ e@@ alth Le@@ ads , not in medi@@ cal school . &quot; &quot; Now n@@ one of these solu@@ tions — the pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ption p@@ ad , the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic medi@@ cal recor@@ d , the wai@@ ting room , the ar@@ my of colle@@ ge students — are perfe@@ ct ."
"But they are ours for the taking — simple exam@@ ples of the v@@ ast under@@ -@@ u@@ ti@@ liz@@ ed health@@ care re@@ sources that , if we re@@ c@@ la@@ im@@ ed and re@@ de@@ plo@@ yed , could realize our most basi@@ c as@@ pi@@ r@@ ation of health@@ care ."
So I had been at Le@@ g@@ al S@@ er@@ vi@@ ces for about n@@ ine months when this idea of H@@ e@@ alth Le@@ ads started per@@ col@@ ating in my mind .
"And I knew I had to tell J@@ ef@@ f P@@ ur@@ cell , my at@@ tor@@ ney , that I needed to leave ."
"And I was so ner@@ v@@ ous , because I thought he was going to be disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ted in me for ab@@ and@@ on@@ ing our cl@@ ien@@ ts for some c@@ razy idea ."
"And I s@@ at down with him and I said , &quot; &quot; J@@ ef@@ f , I have this idea that we could mo@@ bi@@ li@@ ze colle@@ ge students to ad@@ dre@@ ss patients &apos; most basi@@ c health needs . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ll be hon@@ est , all I wanted was for him to not be ang@@ ry at me ."
"But he said this , &quot; &quot; Re@@ be@@ c@@ ca , when you have a vision , you have an ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation to realize that vision ."
"You must pur@@ su@@ e that vision . &quot; &quot; And I have to say , I was like &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a ."
"That &apos;s a lot of pres@@ sure . &quot; &quot; I just wanted a bl@@ ess@@ ing , I didn &apos;t want some kind of m@@ and@@ ate ."
But the tru@@ th is I &apos;ve spent every wa@@ king minu@@ te ne@@ ar@@ ly since then ch@@ as@@ ing that vision .
I believe that we all have a vision for health@@ care in this country .
"I believe that at the end of the day when we meas@@ ure our health@@ care , it will not be by the dise@@ ases cu@@ red , but by the dise@@ ases pre@@ ven@@ ted ."
"It will not be by the ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ence of our technolog@@ ies or the s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ cation of our speci@@ ali@@ sts , but by how r@@ are@@ ly we needed them ."
"And most of all , I believe that when we meas@@ ure health@@ care , it will be , not by what the system was , but by what we cho@@ se it to be ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
And you don &apos;t have se@@ x .
So mag@@ ic is a very in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted fie@@ ld .
"W@@ hi@@ le scienti@@ sts regu@@ lar@@ ly publi@@ sh their lat@@ est research , we mag@@ i@@ ci@@ ans do not like to share our meth@@ ods and se@@ cre@@ ts ."
That &apos;s true even am@@ on@@ g@@ st pe@@ ers .
"But if you look at cre@@ ative prac@@ ti@@ ce as a form of research , or art as a form of R &a@@ m@@ p@@ ; D for hum@@ ani@@ ty , then how could a cy@@ ber il@@ lu@@ si@@ oni@@ st like myself share his research ?"
Now my own speci@@ ality is com@@ b@@ ining di@@ gi@@ tal technology and mag@@ ic .
"And about three years ago , I started an ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se in open@@ ness and inclu@@ si@@ ven@@ ess by re@@ ach@@ ing out into the open@@ -@@ source so@@ f@@ tw@@ are community to create new di@@ gi@@ tal to@@ ols for mag@@ ic — to@@ ols that could ev@@ en@@ tually be sh@@ ared with other arti@@ sts to start them off f@@ ur@@ ther on in the process and to get them to the po@@ e@@ try f@@ ast@@ er ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , I &apos;d like to show you something which came out of these col@@ labor@@ ations ."
"It &apos;s an au@@ g@@ men@@ ted re@@ ality proje@@ ction trac@@ king and ma@@ pping system , or a di@@ gi@@ tal stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ling to@@ ol ."
C@@ ould we bring down the li@@ ghts ple@@ ase ? Thank you .
So let &apos;s give this a try .

"I am no desig@@ ner , no@@ pe , no way ."
"My d@@ ad was , which is kind of an interesting way to gro@@ w up ."
I had to figure out what it is my d@@ ad did and why it was important .
"D@@ ad tal@@ ked a lot about bad design when we were grow@@ ing up , you know , &quot; &quot; B@@ ad design is just people not thinking , Joh@@ n , &quot; &quot; he would say wh@@ en@@ ever a kid would be in@@ ju@@ red by a ro@@ t@@ ary l@@ aw@@ n mow@@ er or , say , a ty@@ pew@@ ri@@ ter ri@@ b@@ b@@ on would get t@@ ang@@ led or an e@@ gg@@ be@@ ater would get j@@ am@@ med in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en ."
"You know , &quot; &quot; De@@ sig@@ n — bad design , there &apos;s just no ex@@ c@@ use for it ."
It &apos;s le@@ tting stuff happen without thinking about it .
"E@@ very obje@@ ct should be about something , Joh@@ n ."
It should imagine a us@@ er .
It should c@@ ast that us@@ er in a story star@@ ring the us@@ er and the obje@@ ct .
"G@@ o@@ od design , &quot; &quot; my d@@ ad said , &quot; &quot; is about sup@@ pl@@ ying in@@ t@@ ent . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what he said ."
D@@ ad hel@@ ped design the control pan@@ els for the I@@ B@@ M 3@@ 60 computer .
That was a big deal ; that was important . He worked for K@@ od@@ ak for a while ; that was important .
He desig@@ ned cha@@ ir@@ s and des@@ ks and other offi@@ ce e@@ qui@@ pment for Ste@@ el@@ case ; that was important .
"I knew design was important in my house because , for he@@ a@@ ven &apos;s s@@ ake , it put food on our table , right ?"
And design was in everything my d@@ ad did .
"He had a D@@ i@@ x@@ ie@@ land j@@ az@@ z b@@ and when we were grow@@ ing up , and he would always co@@ ver L@@ ou@@ is Ar@@ m@@ stron@@ g tu@@ n@@ es ."
"And I would ask him every once in a while , &quot; D@@ ad , do you want it to sound like the recor@@ d ? &quot;"
We had lots of old j@@ az@@ z recor@@ ds l@@ ying around the house .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; No , never , Joh@@ n , never ."
"The s@@ ong is just a given , that &apos;s how you have to think about it ."
You got@@ ta make it your own . You got@@ ta design it .
"S@@ how everyone what you inten@@ d , &quot; &quot; is what he said ."
"&quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ ing that , ac@@ ting by design , is what we all should be doing ."
It &apos;s where we all be@@ long . &quot; &quot; All of us ? De@@ sig@@ n@@ ers ?
"O@@ h , oh , D@@ ad . Oh , D@@ ad ."
The s@@ ong is just a given .
It &apos;s how you co@@ ver it that mat@@ ters .
"Well , let &apos;s h@@ old on to that thought for just a minu@@ te ."
"It &apos;s kind of like this whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir I &apos;m in , right ?"
The ori@@ gin@@ al tu@@ ne ? It &apos;s a little sc@@ ary .
"&quot; &quot; O@@ oh , what happened to that du@@ de ?"
He can &apos;t walk . An@@ y@@ body know the story ?
"A@@ n@@ y@@ body ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like to talk about this very much , but I &apos;ll tell you guys the story today ."
"A@@ ll right , exactly 3@@ 6 years ago this week , that &apos;s right , I was in a po@@ or@@ ly desig@@ ned au@@ tom@@ ob@@ ile that h@@ it a po@@ or@@ ly desig@@ ned gu@@ ar@@ dra@@ il on a po@@ or@@ ly desig@@ ned ro@@ ad in P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , and p@@ lu@@ m@@ me@@ ted down a 200@@ -@@ fo@@ ot em@@ ban@@ k@@ ment and kil@@ led two people in the car ."
"But ever since then , the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir has been a given in my life ."
"My life , at the mer@@ cy of good design and bad design ."
"Th@@ in@@ k about it . Now , in design terms , a whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir is a very difficult obje@@ ct ."
"It mo@@ st@@ ly proje@@ cts tra@@ ge@@ dy and fe@@ ar and mis@@ for@@ tu@@ ne , and it proje@@ cts that mess@@ age , that story , so stron@@ g@@ ly that it almost bl@@ ots out anything else ."
"I ro@@ ll s@@ wi@@ f@@ tly through an air@@ port , right ?"
"And mom@@ s gra@@ b their kids out of the way and say , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t st@@ are ! &quot; &quot; The po@@ or kid , you know , has this terri@@ f@@ ied look on his face , God know@@ s what they think ."
"And for de@@ ca@@ des , I &apos;m going , why does this happen ? What can I do about it ? How can I change this ? I mean there must be something ."
"So I would ro@@ ll , I &apos;d make no ey@@ e cont@@ act — just kin@@ da fro@@ w@@ n , right ?"
"O@@ r I &apos;d dre@@ ss up really , really sh@@ ar@@ ply or something ."
O@@ r I &apos;d make ey@@ e cont@@ act with everyone — that was really cre@@ e@@ py ; that didn &apos;t work at all .
"( Laughter ) You know anything , I &apos;d try . I wouldn &apos;t show@@ er for a week — nothing worked ."
"N@@ o@@ thing wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever worked until a few years ago , my si@@ x@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old d@@ augh@@ ters were looking at this whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir cat@@ al@@ o@@ g that I had , and they said , &quot; Oh , D@@ ad ! D@@ ad ! L@@ ook , you got@@ ta get these , these f@@ las@@ h@@ y whe@@ els — you got@@ ta get &apos; em ! &quot;"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , girls , D@@ ad is a very important jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st , that just wouldn &apos;t do at all . &quot; &quot; And of course , they im@@ medi@@ ately con@@ clu@@ ded , &quot; &quot; Oh , what a bu@@ m@@ m@@ er , D@@ ad . J@@ our@@ n@@ ali@@ sts ar@@ en &apos;t allow@@ ed to have f@@ las@@ h@@ y whe@@ els ."
"I mean , how important could you be then ? &quot; &quot; they said ."
"I went , &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ it a minu@@ te , all right , right — I &apos;ll get the whe@@ els . &quot; &quot; P@@ u@@ re@@ ly out of prote@@ st , I got the f@@ las@@ h@@ y whe@@ els , and I in@@ stal@@ led them and — che@@ ck this out . C@@ ould I have my spe@@ cial light cu@@ e ple@@ ase ?"
( Laughter ) L@@ ook at that !
"Now ... look at , look at this ! L@@ ook at this !"
"So what you are looking at here has completely changed my life , I mean tot@@ ally changed my life ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad of bl@@ ank star@@ es and aw@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ ness , now it is poin@@ ting and smi@@ ling !"
"P@@ e@@ ople going , &quot; &quot; A@@ w@@ es@@ ome whe@@ els , du@@ de ! Th@@ ose are aw@@ es@@ ome !"
"I mean , I want some of those whe@@ els ! &quot; &quot; L@@ it@@ tle kids say , &quot; C@@ an I have a ri@@ de ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) And of course there &apos;s the oc@@ ca@@ si@@ onal person — usu@@ ally a mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ aged m@@ ale who will say , &quot; &quot; Oh , those whe@@ els are great !"
"I gu@@ ess they &apos;re for sa@@ fe@@ ty , right ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) No ! They &apos;re not for sa@@ fe@@ ty ."
"No , no , no , no , no ."
"What &apos;s the difference here , the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir with no li@@ ghts and the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir with li@@ ghts ?"
The difference is in@@ t@@ ent .
"That &apos;s right , that &apos;s right ; I &apos;m no longer a vi@@ cti@@ m ."
I cho@@ se to change the situ@@ ation — I &apos;m the C@@ om@@ man@@ der of the St@@ ar@@ ship W@@ he@@ el@@ cha@@ ir with the p@@ ha@@ s@@ er whe@@ els in the front . R@@ ight ?
In@@ t@@ ent chang@@ es the picture completely .
I cho@@ ose to en@@ h@@ ance this rol@@ ling experience with a simple design ele@@ ment .
A@@ cting with in@@ t@@ ent .
It con@@ ve@@ ys au@@ th@@ or@@ ship .
It su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that someone is dri@@ ving .
It &apos;s reas@@ sur@@ ing ; people are d@@ raw@@ n to it .
S@@ ome@@ one making the experience their own .
"C@@ over@@ ing the tra@@ gi@@ c tu@@ ne with something different , something radi@@ cally different ."
Pe@@ ople re@@ spo@@ nd to that .
"Now it seem@@ s simple , but actually I think in our society and culture in gener@@ al , we have a huge problem with in@@ t@@ ent ."
Now go with me here . L@@ ook at this guy . You know who this is ?
"It &apos;s An@@ ders B@@ re@@ i@@ vi@@ k . Now , if he inten@@ ded to ki@@ ll in O@@ l@@ so , Nor@@ way last year , do@@ z@@ ens and do@@ z@@ ens of young people — if he inten@@ ded to do that , he &apos;s a vi@@ ci@@ ous cri@@ min@@ al . We pu@@ ni@@ sh him ."
"L@@ i@@ fe in pri@@ son . De@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty in the United States , not so much in Nor@@ way ."
"But , if he instead ac@@ ted out of a de@@ lu@@ si@@ onal fan@@ t@@ asy , if he was moti@@ v@@ ated by some ran@@ dom ment@@ al il@@ l@@ ness , he &apos;s in a completely different c@@ ate@@ g@@ ory ."
"We may put him away for life , but we wat@@ ch him c@@ lini@@ cally ."
It &apos;s a completely different dom@@ a@@ in .
"As an inten@@ ti@@ onal mu@@ r@@ der@@ er , An@@ ders B@@ re@@ i@@ vi@@ k is mer@@ ely evi@@ l ."
"But as a dy@@ s@@ fun@@ cti@@ onal , as a dy@@ s@@ fun@@ cti@@ onal mu@@ r@@ der@@ er / psy@@ ch@@ oti@@ c , he &apos;s something much more comp@@ lic@@ ated ."
"He &apos;s the bre@@ ath of some pri@@ mi@@ tive , an@@ cient cha@@ os ."
He &apos;s the ran@@ dom state of nature we em@@ er@@ g@@ ed from .
"He &apos;s something very , very different ."
It &apos;s as though in@@ t@@ ent is an essen@@ tial com@@ pon@@ ent for hum@@ ani@@ ty .
It &apos;s what we &apos;re sup@@ posed to do some@@ how .
We &apos;re sup@@ posed to act with in@@ t@@ ent .
We &apos;re sup@@ posed to do things by design .
In@@ t@@ ent is a mark@@ er for ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation .
Now here &apos;s an example a little clo@@ s@@ er to home : My family is all about in@@ t@@ ent .
"You can probably tell there are two se@@ ts of tw@@ ins , the resul@@ t of I@@ V@@ F technology , in vi@@ tr@@ o fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ation technology , du@@ e to some physi@@ cal li@@ mi@@ t@@ ations I won &apos;t go into ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , in vi@@ tr@@ o technology , I@@ V@@ F , is about as inten@@ ti@@ onal as agri@@ culture ."
"L@@ et me tell you , some of you may have the experience ."
"In fact , the whole technology of sp@@ er@@ m ex@@ trac@@ tion for sp@@ in@@ al cor@@ d-@@ in@@ ju@@ red mal@@ es was inv@@ en@@ ted by a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an ."
I met the du@@ de . He &apos;s a great guy .
"He car@@ ried this big lea@@ ther ba@@ g full of sp@@ er@@ m pro@@ be@@ s for all of the animals that he &apos;d worked with , all the different animals ."
"P@@ ro@@ be@@ s he desig@@ ned , and in fact , he was really , really pro@@ u@@ d of these pro@@ be@@ s ."
"He would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re right between hor@@ se and squ@@ ir@@ re@@ l , Joh@@ n . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But any@@ way , so when my wi@@ fe and I decided to up@@ gra@@ de our early mi@@ ddle age — we had four kids , after all — with a little different technology that I won &apos;t expla@@ in in too much de@@ ta@@ il here — my u@@ ro@@ logi@@ st as@@ su@@ red me I had nothing wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever to wor@@ ry about ."
"&quot; No need for bir@@ th control , D@@ o@@ c , are you sure about that ? &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; Joh@@ n , Joh@@ n , I looked at your char@@ t ."
F@@ ro@@ m your sp@@ er@@ m te@@ sts we can con@@ fi@@ d@@ ently say that you &apos;re basically a form of bir@@ th control . &quot; &quot; Well !
( Laughter ) What a li@@ ber@@ ating thought ! Yes !
"And after a couple very li@@ ber@@ ating we@@ ek@@ en@@ ds , my wi@@ fe and I , u@@ ti@@ liz@@ ing some cu@@ t@@ t@@ ing@@ -@@ ed@@ ge er@@ e@@ cti@@ le technology that is cer@@ tain@@ ly wor@@ th@@ y of a TE@@ D@@ T@@ al@@ k some@@ day but I won &apos;t get into it now , we noti@@ ced some fami@@ li@@ ar , if u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted , sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s ."
I wasn &apos;t exactly a form of bir@@ th control .
L@@ ook at that f@@ on@@ t there . My wi@@ fe was so pis@@ sed .
"I mean , did a desig@@ ner come up with that ?"
"No , I don &apos;t think a desig@@ ner did come up with that ."
"In fact , maybe that &apos;s the problem ."
"And so , little A@@ ja@@ x was born ."
"He &apos;s like our other children , but the experience is completely different ."
"It &apos;s something like my ac@@ ci@@ dent , right ?"
He came out of now@@ here .
"But we all had to change , but not just re@@ act to the given ; we b@@ end to this new experience with in@@ t@@ ent ."
We &apos;re five now . F@@ i@@ ve .
F@@ ac@@ ing the given with in@@ t@@ ent . D@@ o@@ ing things by design .
"H@@ ey , the name A@@ ja@@ x — you can &apos;t get much more inten@@ ti@@ onal than that , right ?"
We &apos;re really hop@@ ing he th@@ an@@ ks us for that later on .
"( Laughter ) But I never became a desig@@ ner . No , no , no , no . N@@ ever at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted . N@@ ever even close ."
"I did love some great desig@@ ns as I was grow@@ ing up : The H@@ P 3@@ 5@@ S cal@@ cu@@ lat@@ or — God , I lo@@ ved that thing . Oh God , I wi@@ sh I had one ."
"M@@ an , I love that thing ."
I could af@@ for@@ d that .
"O@@ ther desig@@ ns I really couldn &apos;t af@@ for@@ d , like the 19@@ 7@@ 4 9@@ 11 T@@ ar@@ ga ."
"In school , I stud@@ ied nothing close to design or engine@@ ering ; I stud@@ ied us@@ el@@ ess things like the C@@ las@@ si@@ cs , but there were some l@@ ess@@ ons even there — this guy , P@@ la@@ to , it turns out he &apos;s a desig@@ ner ."
"He desig@@ ned a state in &quot; &quot; The Re@@ public , &quot; &quot; a design never im@@ ple@@ men@@ ted ."
"L@@ ist@@ en to one of the design fe@@ at@@ ures of P@@ la@@ to &apos;s G@@ over@@ n@@ ment 4@@ .@@ 0 : &quot; &quot; The St@@ ate in which the ru@@ l@@ ers are most re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant to gover@@ n is always the best and most qu@@ ie@@ tly gover@@ ned , and the St@@ ate in which they are most e@@ ag@@ er , the wor@@ st . &quot; &quot; Well , got that wrong , didn &apos;t we ?"
But look at that stat@@ ement ; it &apos;s all about in@@ t@@ ent . That &apos;s what I love about it .
But consi@@ der what P@@ la@@ to is doing here . What is he doing ?
"It &apos;s a gr@@ and idea of design — a huge idea of design , common to all of the vo@@ i@@ ces of religi@@ on and phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y that em@@ er@@ g@@ ed in the C@@ las@@ si@@ cal per@@ i@@ od ."
What was going on then ?
They were trying to answer the question of what would human be@@ ings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survi@@ ve ?
"As the human rac@@ e em@@ er@@ g@@ ed from a pre@@ histor@@ ic cha@@ os , a con@@ fron@@ tation with ran@@ dom , bru@@ tal nature , they sud@@ den@@ ly had a moment to think — and there was a lot to think about ."
"A@@ ll of a sud@@ den , human ex@@ ist@@ ence needed an in@@ t@@ ent ."
H@@ um@@ an life needed a reason .
Re@@ ality itself needed a desig@@ ner .
"The given was re@@ plac@@ ed by v@@ ari@@ ous aspe@@ cts of in@@ t@@ ent , by v@@ ari@@ ous desig@@ ns , by v@@ ari@@ ous god@@ s ."
G@@ ods we &apos;re still fi@@ gh@@ ting about . Oh ye@@ ah .
T@@ od@@ ay we don &apos;t con@@ front the cha@@ os of nature .
T@@ od@@ ay it is the cha@@ os of hum@@ ani@@ ty &apos;s impac@@ t on the Earth itself that we con@@ front .
"This young dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine called design , I think , is in fact the em@@ er@@ g@@ ing e@@ th@@ os for@@ mu@@ lat@@ ing and then ans@@ wer@@ ing a very new question : What sh@@ all we do now in the face of the cha@@ os that we have created ?"
What sh@@ all we do ?
"H@@ ow sh@@ all we in@@ sc@@ ri@@ be in@@ t@@ ent on all the obje@@ cts we create , on all the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces we create , on all the places we change ?"
The con@@ sequ@@ ences of a planet with 7 billion people and coun@@ ting .
"That &apos;s the tu@@ ne we &apos;re all co@@ ver@@ ing today , all of us ."
And we can &apos;t just imi@@ t@@ ate the past . No .
That won &apos;t do .
That won &apos;t do at all .
"H@@ ere &apos;s my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te design moment : In the city of K@@ in@@ sha@@ sa in Za@@ i@@ re in the 199@@ 0s , I was working for A@@ B@@ C N@@ ew@@ s , and I was re@@ por@@ ting on the f@@ all of M@@ ob@@ u@@ tu S@@ ese Se@@ ko , the di@@ ct@@ ator , the bru@@ tal di@@ ct@@ ator in Za@@ i@@ re , who ra@@ ped and pi@@ ll@@ aged that country ."
There was ri@@ ot@@ ing in the mi@@ ddle of K@@ in@@ sha@@ sa .
"The place was fal@@ ling a@@ part ; it was a hor@@ ri@@ ble , hor@@ ri@@ ble place , and I needed to go and expl@@ ore the cen@@ ter of K@@ in@@ sha@@ sa to re@@ port on the ri@@ ot@@ ing and the lo@@ ot@@ ing ."
"P@@ e@@ ople were car@@ ry@@ ing off ve@@ hi@@ cles , car@@ ry@@ ing off pie@@ ces of buil@@ dings ."
S@@ ol@@ d@@ ier@@ s were in the stre@@ ets sho@@ ot@@ ing at lo@@ ot@@ ers and her@@ ding some in mas@@ s ar@@ re@@ sts .
"In the mi@@ ddle of this cha@@ os , I &apos;m rol@@ ling around in a whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir , and I was completely in@@ visi@@ ble . C@@ om@@ ple@@ tely ."
I was in a whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir ; I didn &apos;t look like a lo@@ ot@@ er .
"I was in a whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir ; I didn &apos;t look like a jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly , at least from their perspe@@ ctive ."
"And I didn &apos;t look like a sol@@ d@@ ier , that &apos;s for sure ."
"I was part of this sort of back@@ ground no@@ ise of the mi@@ ser@@ y of Za@@ i@@ re , completely in@@ visi@@ ble ."
"And all of a sud@@ den , from around a cor@@ ner , comes this young man , par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , just like me , in this me@@ tal and wood and lea@@ ther pe@@ d@@ al , thre@@ e-@@ whe@@ el tri@@ cy@@ cle@@ -@@ whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir de@@ vice , and he pe@@ d@@ als up to me as f@@ ast as he can ."
"He goes , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , mi@@ ster ! M@@ ist@@ er ! &quot; &quot; And I looked at him — he didn &apos;t know any other En@@ g@@ li@@ sh than that , but we didn &apos;t need En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , no , no , no , no , no ."
We s@@ at there and com@@ par@@ ed whe@@ els and ti@@ res and spo@@ k@@ es and tu@@ be@@ s .
And I looked at his wh@@ ac@@ k@@ y pe@@ d@@ al mechani@@ sm ; he was full of pri@@ de over his design .
I wi@@ sh I could show you that con@@ tra@@ ption .
"H@@ is smi@@ le , our g@@ low as we tal@@ ked a uni@@ vers@@ al language of design , in@@ visi@@ ble to the cha@@ os around us ."
"H@@ is mach@@ ine : hom@@ em@@ ade , b@@ ol@@ ted , ru@@ sty , com@@ i@@ cal ."
"My mach@@ ine : Ameri@@ can@@ -@@ made , con@@ fi@@ dent , sle@@ ek ."
"He was parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly pro@@ u@@ d of the comfor@@ table se@@ at , really comfor@@ table se@@ at he had made in his ch@@ ari@@ ot and its beautiful f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c fr@@ in@@ ge around the ed@@ ge ."
"O@@ h , I wi@@ sh I &apos;d had those sp@@ ar@@ k@@ ly whe@@ els back then to have sh@@ own him , man !"
He would have lo@@ ved those ! Oh ye@@ ah .
He would have under@@ sto@@ od those ; a ch@@ ari@@ ot of pu@@ re in@@ t@@ ent — think about it — in a city out of control .
De@@ sig@@ n b@@ le@@ w it all away for a moment .
We spo@@ ke for a few minutes and then each of us v@@ ani@@ shed back into the cha@@ os .
"He went back to the stre@@ ets of K@@ in@@ sha@@ sa ; I went to my hot@@ el . And I think of him now , now ..."
And I pos@@ e this question .
"A@@ n obje@@ ct im@@ bu@@ ed with in@@ t@@ ent — it has power , it &apos;s tre@@ as@@ ure , we &apos;re d@@ raw@@ n to it ."
"A@@ n obje@@ ct de@@ vo@@ id of in@@ t@@ ent — it &apos;s ran@@ dom , it &apos;s imi@@ t@@ ative , it re@@ pe@@ ls us . It &apos;s like a piece of j@@ un@@ k ma@@ il to be th@@ row@@ n away ."
"This is what we must de@@ m@@ and of our lives , of our obje@@ cts , of our things , of our cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces : living with in@@ t@@ ent ."
"And I have to say that on that sc@@ ore , I have a very un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ an@@ t@@ age over all of you ."
And I want to expla@@ in it to you now because this is a very spe@@ cial day .
"Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ six years ago at ne@@ ar@@ ly this moment , a 19@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y a@@ wo@@ ke from a com@@ a to ask a n@@ ur@@ se a question , but the n@@ ur@@ se was already there with an answer ."
"&quot; &quot; You &apos;ve had a terri@@ ble ac@@ ci@@ dent , young man . You &apos;ve bro@@ k@@ en your back ."
"You &apos;ll never walk again . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I know all that — what day is it ? &quot; &quot; You see , I knew that the car had gone over the gu@@ ar@@ dra@@ il on the 2@@ 8@@ th of F@@ e@@ bru@@ ary , and I knew that 19@@ 7@@ 6 was a lea@@ p year ."
&quot; N@@ ur@@ se ! Is this the 2@@ 8@@ th or the 2@@ 9@@ th ? &quot;
"And she looked at me and said , &quot; It &apos;s Mar@@ ch 1@@ st . &quot;"
"And I went , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ."
"I &apos;ve got some cat@@ ching up to do ! &quot; &quot; And from that moment , I knew the given was that ac@@ ci@@ dent ; I had no op@@ tion but to make up this new life without wal@@ king ."
"In@@ t@@ ent — a life with in@@ t@@ ent — li@@ ved by design , co@@ ver@@ ing the ori@@ gin@@ al with something better ."
It &apos;s something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times .
"To get back to this , to get back to design , and as my d@@ ad@@ dy su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed a long time ago , &quot; &quot; M@@ ake the s@@ ong your own , Joh@@ n ."
"S@@ how everybody what you inten@@ d . &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , this one &apos;s for you ."
"( Music ) ♫ J@@ o J@@ o was a man who thought he was a lon@@ er ♫ ♫ but he was another man . ♫ ♫ J@@ o J@@ o left his home in T@@ u@@ c@@ son , A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona to at@@ ten@@ d a C@@ alifor@@ nia bas@@ h . ♫ ♫ G@@ et back , get back , ♫ ♫ get back to where you once be@@ lon@@ g@@ ed . ♫ ♫ G@@ et back , get back , ♫ ♫ get back to where you once be@@ lon@@ g@@ ed . ♫ ( Applause )"
"This is po@@ o , and what I want to do today is share my pas@@ sion for po@@ o with you , which might be quite difficult , but I think what you might find more fas@@ cin@@ ating is the way these small animals deal with po@@ o ."
"So this ani@@ mal here has got a brain about the size of a gra@@ in of ri@@ ce , and yet it can do things that you and I couldn &apos;t possi@@ bly en@@ ter@@ tain the idea of doing ."
"And basically it &apos;s all ev@@ olved to hand@@ le its food source , which is d@@ ung ."
"So the question is , where do we start this story ?"
"And it seem@@ s appro@@ pri@@ ate to start at the end , because this is a wa@@ ste produ@@ ct that comes out of other animals , but it still con@@ ta@@ ins nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ ts and there are su@@ f@@ fi@@ cient nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ ts in there for d@@ ung be@@ et@@ les basically to make a living , and so d@@ ung be@@ et@@ les e@@ at d@@ ung , and their lar@@ v@@ a@@ e are also d@@ un@@ g@@ -@@ fe@@ ed@@ ers ."
They are grow@@ n completely in a ball of d@@ ung .
"Wi@@ th@@ in S@@ outh Africa , we &apos;ve got about 8@@ 00 species of d@@ ung be@@ et@@ les , in Africa we &apos;ve got 2@@ ,000 species of d@@ ung be@@ et@@ les , and in the world we have about 6@@ ,000 species of d@@ ung be@@ et@@ les ."
"So , ac@@ cor@@ ding to d@@ ung be@@ et@@ les , d@@ ung is pretty good ."
"U@@ n@@ less you &apos;re pre@@ par@@ ed to get d@@ ung under your fin@@ ger@@ na@@ il@@ s and ro@@ ot through the d@@ ung itself , you &apos;ll never see 90 percent of the d@@ ung be@@ e@@ tle species , because they go dire@@ ct@@ ly into the d@@ ung , stra@@ ight down be@@ low it , and then they sh@@ ut@@ tle back and for@@ th between the d@@ ung at the so@@ il surface and a n@@ est they make under@@ ground ."
"So the question is , how do they deal with this materi@@ al ?"
And most d@@ ung be@@ et@@ les actually w@@ ra@@ p it into a pac@@ k@@ age of some sort .
"T@@ en percent of the species actually make a ball , and this ball they ro@@ ll away from the d@@ ung source , usu@@ ally bu@@ ry it at a re@@ mot@@ e place away from the d@@ ung source , and they have a very particular behavi@@ or by which they are able to ro@@ ll their bal@@ ls ."
So this is a very pro@@ u@@ d ow@@ ner of a beautiful d@@ ung ball .
"You can see it &apos;s a m@@ ale because he &apos;s got a little ha@@ ir on the back of his le@@ gs there , and he &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly very ple@@ as@@ ed about what he &apos;s sitting on there ."
And then he &apos;s about to become a vi@@ cti@@ m of a vi@@ ci@@ ous s@@ mas@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ gra@@ b . ( Laughter ) And this is a clear indi@@ cation that this is a val@@ u@@ able re@@ source .
"And so val@@ u@@ able re@@ sources have to be looked after and gu@@ ar@@ ded in a particular way , and we think the reason they ro@@ ll the bal@@ ls away is because of this , because of the compe@@ ti@@ tion that is inv@@ olved in getting h@@ old of that d@@ ung ."
"So this d@@ ung p@@ at was actually — well , it was a d@@ ung p@@ at 15 minutes before this photogra@@ ph was taken , and we think it &apos;s the inten@@ se compe@@ ti@@ tion that makes the be@@ et@@ les so wel@@ l-@@ ad@@ ap@@ ted to rol@@ ling bal@@ ls of d@@ ung ."
So what you &apos;ve got to imagine here is this ani@@ mal here moving across the Afri@@ can ve@@ ld .
I@@ ts head is down . It &apos;s wal@@ king back@@ war@@ ds .
"It &apos;s the most bi@@ zar@@ re way to actually transpor@@ t your food in any particular dire@@ ction , and at the same time it &apos;s got to deal with the he@@ at ."
This is Africa . It &apos;s ho@@ t .
So what I want to share with you now are some of the experim@@ ents that myself and my colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es have used to inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ate how d@@ ung be@@ et@@ les deal with these problems .
"So wat@@ ch this be@@ e@@ tle , and there &apos;s two things that I would like you to be aw@@ are of ."
"The first is how it de@@ als with this ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we &apos;ve put in its way . Se@@ e , look , it does a little dance , and then it car@@ r@@ ies on in exactly the same dire@@ ction that it took in the first place ."
"A little dance , and then he@@ ads off in a particular dire@@ ction ."
"So c@@ lear@@ ly this ani@@ mal know@@ s where it &apos;s going and it know@@ s where it wan@@ ts to go , and that &apos;s a very , very important thing , because if you think about it , you &apos;re at the d@@ ung pi@@ le , you &apos;ve got this great big p@@ ie that you want to get away from everybody else , and the quick@@ est way to do it is in a stra@@ ight line ."
"So we gave them some more t@@ as@@ ks to deal with , and what we did here is we turned the world under their fe@@ et . And wat@@ ch its respon@@ se ."
So this ani@@ mal has actually had the whole world turned under its fe@@ et . It &apos;s turned by 90 de@@ gre@@ es .
"But it doesn &apos;t f@@ lin@@ ch . It know@@ s exactly where it wan@@ ts to go , and it he@@ ads off in that particular dire@@ ction ."
"So our next question then was , how are they doing this ?"
What are they doing ? And there was a cu@@ e that was available to us .
It was that every now and then they &apos;d clim@@ b on top of the ball and they &apos;d take a look at the world around them .
And what do you think they could be looking at as they clim@@ b on top of the ball ?
"What are the obvi@@ ous cu@@ es that this ani@@ mal could use to dire@@ ct its movement ? And the most obvi@@ ous one is to look at the sk@@ y , and so we thought , now what could they be looking at in the sk@@ y ?"
And the obvi@@ ous thing to look at is the su@@ n .
"So a clas@@ si@@ c experim@@ ent here , in that what we did was we mo@@ ved the su@@ n ."
What we &apos;re going to do now is sha@@ de the su@@ n with a bo@@ ard and then move the su@@ n with a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r to a completely different posi@@ tion .
And look at what the be@@ e@@ tle does .
"It does a little d@@ ou@@ ble dance , and then it he@@ ads back in exactly the same dire@@ ction it went in the first place ."
What happens now ? So c@@ lear@@ ly they &apos;re looking at the su@@ n .
The su@@ n is a very important cu@@ e in the sk@@ y for them .
"The thing is the su@@ n is not always available to you , because at su@@ n@@ set it disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars be@@ low the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on ."
What is happening in the sk@@ y here is that there &apos;s a great big pat@@ ter@@ n of po@@ lar@@ i@@ zed light in the sk@@ y that you and I can &apos;t see . It &apos;s the way our eyes are built .
"But the su@@ n is at the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on over here and we know that when the su@@ n is at the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on , say it &apos;s over on this side , there is a nor@@ th@@ -@@ s@@ outh , a huge pa@@ th@@ way across the sk@@ y of po@@ lar@@ i@@ zed light that we can &apos;t see that the be@@ et@@ les can see ."
"So how do we test that ? Well , that &apos;s e@@ asy ."
"What we do is we get a great big po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ ation fil@@ ter , po@@ p the be@@ e@@ tle under@@ ne@@ ath it , and the fil@@ ter is at right ang@@ les to the po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ ation pat@@ ter@@ n of the sk@@ y ."
"The be@@ e@@ tle comes out from under@@ ne@@ ath the fil@@ ter and it does a ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand turn , because it comes back under the sk@@ y that it was ori@@ gin@@ ally or@@ ien@@ t@@ ated to and then re@@ or@@ ien@@ t@@ ates itself back to the dire@@ ction it was ori@@ gin@@ ally going in ."
So obvi@@ ously be@@ et@@ les can see po@@ lar@@ i@@ zed light .
"O@@ kay , so what we &apos;ve got so far is , what are be@@ et@@ les doing ? They &apos;re rol@@ ling bal@@ ls ."
"H@@ ow are they doing it ? Well , they &apos;re rol@@ ling them in a stra@@ ight line ."
How are they ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ining it in a particular stra@@ ight line ?
"Well , they &apos;re looking at ce@@ le@@ sti@@ al cu@@ es in the sk@@ y , some of which you and I can &apos;t see ."
But how do they pi@@ ck up those ce@@ le@@ sti@@ al cu@@ es ?
That was what was of inter@@ est to us next .
"And it was this particular little behavi@@ or , the dance , that we thought was important , because look , it takes a pa@@ use every now and then , and then he@@ ads off in the dire@@ ction that it wan@@ ts to go in ."
So what are they doing when they do this dance ?
How far can we p@@ us@@ h them before they will re@@ or@@ ien@@ t@@ ate themselves ?
"And in this experim@@ ent here , what we did was we for@@ ced them into a ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l , and you can see he wasn &apos;t parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly for@@ ced into this particular ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l , and we gra@@ du@@ ally disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed the be@@ e@@ tle by 1@@ 80 de@@ gre@@ es until this individu@@ al en@@ ds up going in exactly the op@@ posi@@ te dire@@ ction that it wanted to go in , in the first place ."
"And let &apos;s see what his re@@ action is as he &apos;s he@@ ad@@ ed through 90 de@@ gre@@ es here , and now he &apos;s going to — when he en@@ ds up down here , he &apos;s going to be 1@@ 80 de@@ gre@@ es in the wrong dire@@ ction ."
And see what his respon@@ se is .
"He does a little dance , he turns around , and he@@ ads back in this . He know@@ s exactly where he &apos;s going ."
"He know@@ s exactly what the problem is , and he know@@ s exactly how to deal with it , and the dance is this tran@@ si@@ tion behavi@@ or that allow@@ s them to re@@ or@@ ien@@ t@@ ate themselves ."
"So that &apos;s the dance , but after sp@@ ending many years sitting in the Afri@@ can bus@@ h wat@@ ching d@@ ung be@@ et@@ les on nice ho@@ t days , we noti@@ ced that there was another behavi@@ or as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with the dance behavi@@ or ."
"E@@ very now and then , when they clim@@ b on top of the ball , they wi@@ pe their face ."
And you see him do it again .
"Now we thought , now what could be going on here ?"
"C@@ lear@@ ly the ground is very ho@@ t , and when the ground is ho@@ t , they dance more often , and when they do this particular dance , they wi@@ pe the bot@@ tom of their face ."
And we thought that it could be a ther@@ mo@@ regu@@ lat@@ ory behavi@@ or .
We thought that maybe what they &apos;re doing is trying to get off the ho@@ t so@@ il and also spit@@ ting on@@ to their face to cool their head down .
So what we did was design a couple of ar@@ en@@ as .
"@@ one was ho@@ t , one was c@@ old ."
We sha@@ ded this one . We left that one ho@@ t .
And then what we did was we fil@@ med them with a ther@@ mal cam@@ era .
"So what you &apos;re looking at here is a he@@ at image of the system , and what you can see here em@@ er@@ g@@ ing from the po@@ o is a cool d@@ ung ball ."
"So the tru@@ th is , if you look at the temper@@ ature over here , d@@ ung is cool . ( Laughter ) So all we &apos;re interested in here is com@@ par@@ ing the temper@@ ature of the be@@ e@@ tle against the back@@ ground ."
So the back@@ ground here is around about 50 de@@ gre@@ es cen@@ ti@@ gra@@ de .
"The be@@ e@@ tle itself and the ball are probably around about 30 to 3@@ 5 de@@ gre@@ es cen@@ ti@@ gra@@ de , so this is a great big ball of ice cre@@ am that this be@@ e@@ tle is now transpor@@ ting across the ho@@ t ve@@ ld ."
"It isn &apos;t clim@@ b@@ ing . It isn &apos;t dan@@ cing , because its body temper@@ ature is actually relati@@ vely low ."
It &apos;s about the same as y@@ ours and m@@ ine .
And what &apos;s of inter@@ est here is that little brain is quite cool .
"But if we con@@ tra@@ st now what happens in a ho@@ t environment , look at the temper@@ ature of the so@@ il ."
It &apos;s up around 5@@ 5 to 60 de@@ gre@@ es cen@@ ti@@ gra@@ de .
W@@ at@@ ch how often the be@@ e@@ tle dan@@ ces .
And look at its front le@@ gs . They &apos;re ro@@ ar@@ ing@@ ly ho@@ t .
"So the ball lea@@ ves a little ther@@ mal sha@@ do@@ w , and the be@@ e@@ tle clim@@ b@@ s on top of the ball and wi@@ p@@ es its face , and all the time it &apos;s trying to cool itself down , we think , and av@@ o@@ id the ho@@ t s@@ and that it &apos;s wal@@ king across ."
"And what we did then was put little bo@@ ots on these le@@ gs , because this was a way to test if the le@@ gs were inv@@ olved in sen@@ sing the temper@@ ature of the so@@ il ."
"And if you look over here , with bo@@ ots they clim@@ b on@@ to the ball far less often when they had no bo@@ ots on ."
So we descri@@ bed these as cool bo@@ ots .
It was a d@@ ent@@ al com@@ po@@ u@@ nd that we used to make these bo@@ ots .
"And we also co@@ o@@ led down the d@@ ung ball , so we were able to put the ball in the f@@ ri@@ dge , gave them a nice cool d@@ ung ball , and they clim@@ bed on@@ to that ball far less often than when they had a ho@@ t ball ."
"So this is called st@@ il@@ ting . It &apos;s a ther@@ mal behavi@@ or that you and I do if we c@@ ross the be@@ ach , we j@@ um@@ p on@@ to a tow@@ el , somebody has this tow@@ el — &quot; &quot; S@@ or@@ ry , I &apos;ve j@@ um@@ ped on@@ to your tow@@ el . &quot; &quot; — and then you s@@ cu@@ t@@ tle across on@@ to somebody else &apos;s tow@@ el , and that way you don &apos;t bur@@ n your fe@@ et ."
And that &apos;s exactly what the be@@ et@@ les are doing here .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , there &apos;s one more story I &apos;d like to share with you , and that &apos;s this particular species ."
It &apos;s from a gen@@ us called P@@ ach@@ y@@ som@@ a .
"There are 1@@ 3 species in the gen@@ us , and they have a particular behavi@@ or that I think you will find interesting ."
This is a d@@ ung be@@ e@@ tle . W@@ at@@ ch what he &apos;s doing .
C@@ an you spo@@ t the difference ?
They don &apos;t nor@@ m@@ ally go this s@@ low@@ ly . It &apos;s in s@@ low moti@@ on .
"@@ but it &apos;s wal@@ king for@@ war@@ ds , and it &apos;s actually taking a pe@@ l@@ let of d@@ ry d@@ ung with it ."
This is a different species in the same gen@@ us but exactly the same for@@ ag@@ ing behavi@@ or .
"There &apos;s one more interesting aspe@@ ct of this d@@ ung be@@ e@@ tle &apos;s behavi@@ or that we found quite fas@@ cin@@ ating , and that &apos;s that it for@@ ages and provi@@ sions a n@@ est ."
"So wat@@ ch this individu@@ al here , and what he &apos;s trying to do is set up a n@@ est ."
"And he doesn &apos;t like this first posi@@ tion , but he comes up with a second posi@@ tion , and about 50 minutes later , that n@@ est is fini@@ shed , and he he@@ ads off to for@@ age and pro@@ vision at a pi@@ le of d@@ ry d@@ ung pe@@ l@@ le@@ ts ."
"And what I want you to noti@@ ce is the ou@@ tw@@ ard pat@@ h com@@ par@@ ed to the h@@ ome@@ ward pat@@ h , and comp@@ are the two ."
"And by and large , you &apos;ll see that the h@@ ome@@ ward pat@@ h is far more dire@@ ct than the ou@@ tw@@ ard pat@@ h ."
"O@@ n the ou@@ tw@@ ard pat@@ h , he &apos;s always on the loo@@ k@@ out for a new blo@@ b of d@@ ung ."
"O@@ n the way home , he know@@ s where home is , and he wan@@ ts to go stra@@ ight to it ."
"The important thing here is that this is not a one@@ -@@ way tri@@ p , as in most d@@ ung be@@ et@@ les . The tri@@ p here is re@@ pe@@ ated back and for@@ th between a pro@@ visi@@ on@@ ing site and a n@@ est site ."
"And wat@@ ch , you &apos;re going to see another S@@ outh Afri@@ can cri@@ me taking place right now . ( Laughter ) And his neigh@@ b@@ or ste@@ als one of his d@@ ung pe@@ l@@ le@@ ts ."
So what we &apos;re looking at here is a behavi@@ or called pat@@ h inte@@ gr@@ ation .
"And what &apos;s taking place is that the be@@ e@@ tle has got a home spo@@ t , it goes out on a con@@ v@@ olu@@ ted pat@@ h looking for food , and then when it fin@@ ds food , it he@@ ads stra@@ ight home . It know@@ s exactly where its home is ."
"Now there &apos;s two ways it could be doing that , and we can test that by disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ing the be@@ e@@ tle to a new posi@@ tion when it &apos;s at the for@@ ag@@ ing site ."
"If it &apos;s using land@@ mar@@ ks , it will find its home ."
"If it is using something called pat@@ h inte@@ gr@@ ation , it will not find its home . It will ar@@ ri@@ ve at the wrong spo@@ t , and what it &apos;s doing here if it &apos;s using pat@@ h inte@@ gr@@ ation is it &apos;s coun@@ ting its ste@@ ps or meas@@ ur@@ ing the di@@ stance out in this dire@@ ction ."
"It know@@ s the be@@ aring home , and it know@@ s it should be in that dire@@ ction ."
"If you disp@@ l@@ ace it , it en@@ ds up in the wrong place ."
So let &apos;s see what happens when we put this be@@ e@@ tle to the test with a si@@ mi@@ lar experim@@ ent .
So here &apos;s our c@@ un@@ ning experim@@ enter .
"He disp@@ l@@ ac@@ es the be@@ e@@ tle , and now we have to see what is going to take place ."
What we &apos;ve got is a bur@@ row . That &apos;s where the for@@ age was .
The for@@ age has been disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed to a new posi@@ tion .
"If he &apos;s using land@@ mar@@ k or@@ ien@@ tation , he should be able to find the bur@@ row , because he &apos;ll be able to re@@ cogni@@ ze the land@@ mar@@ ks around it ."
"If he &apos;s using pat@@ h inte@@ gr@@ ation , then it should end up in the wrong spo@@ t over here ."
So let &apos;s wat@@ ch what happens when we put the be@@ e@@ tle through the whole test .
So there he is there .
"He &apos;s about to head home , and look what happens ."
S@@ ha@@ me .
It ha@@ sn &apos;t a clu@@ e .
"It star@@ ts to sear@@ ch for its house in the right di@@ stance away from the food , but it is c@@ lear@@ ly completely lost ."
"So we know now that this ani@@ mal uses pat@@ h inte@@ gr@@ ation to find its way around , and the cal@@ l@@ ous experim@@ enter le@@ ads it top left and lea@@ ves it . ( Laughter ) So what we &apos;re looking at here are a group of animals that use a comp@@ as@@ s , and they use the su@@ n as a comp@@ as@@ s to find their way around , and they have some sort of system for meas@@ ur@@ ing that di@@ stance , and we know that these species here actually coun@@ t the ste@@ ps . That &apos;s what they use as an od@@ ome@@ ter , a ste@@ p@@ -@@ coun@@ ting system , to find their way back home ."
We don &apos;t know yet what d@@ ung be@@ et@@ les use .
So what have we learned from these animals with a brain that &apos;s the size of a gra@@ in of ri@@ ce ?
"Well , we know that they can ro@@ ll bal@@ ls in a stra@@ ight line using ce@@ le@@ sti@@ al cu@@ es ."
"We know that the dance behavi@@ or is an or@@ ien@@ tation behavi@@ or and it &apos;s also a ther@@ mo@@ regu@@ l@@ ation behavi@@ or , and we also know that they use a pat@@ h inte@@ gr@@ ation system for fin@@ ding their way home ."
So for a small ani@@ mal de@@ al@@ ing with a fa@@ ir@@ ly re@@ vol@@ ting sub@@ stance we can actually learn an aw@@ ful lot from these things doing behavi@@ ors that you and I couldn &apos;t possi@@ bly do .
Thank you . ( Applause )
This po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ ation of en@@ c@@ la@@ ves of me@@ ga@@ -@@ we@@ alth sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by se@@ ct@@ ors of po@@ ver@@ ty and the so@@ ci@@ o@@ economic in@@ equ@@ ali@@ ties they have en@@ gen@@ der@@ ed is really at the cen@@ ter of today &apos;s urb@@ an cri@@ sis .
But I want to beg@@ in ton@@ ight by su@@ gg@@ est@@ ing that this urb@@ an cri@@ sis is not only economic or environ@@ ment@@ al .
"It &apos;s parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly a cul@@ tu@@ ral cri@@ sis , a cri@@ sis of the institu@@ tions u@@ na@@ ble to re@@ imagine the stu@@ pi@@ d ways which we have been grow@@ ing , u@@ na@@ ble to challen@@ ge the o@@ il@@ -@@ hun@@ g@@ ry , sel@@ fish urb@@ ani@@ z@@ ation that have per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated cities based on con@@ sum@@ ption , from s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n C@@ alifor@@ nia to New York to D@@ u@@ ba@@ i ."
"In this bor@@ der regi@@ on , we find some of the we@@ al@@ th@@ ie@@ st real est@@ ate , as I once found in the ed@@ ges of S@@ an D@@ iego , bar@@ ely 20 minutes away from some of the po@@ ore@@ st se@@ t@@ t@@ le@@ ments in L@@ at@@ in America ."
"So I &apos;ve been ar@@ gu@@ ing in the last years that , in fact , the s@@ lu@@ ms of Ti@@ ju@@ ana can te@@ ach a lot to the spraw@@ ls of S@@ an D@@ iego when it comes to so@@ ci@@ o@@ economic susta@@ in@@ ability , that we should pay at@@ ten@@ tion and learn from the many mi@@ gr@@ ant communi@@ ties on both si@@ des of this bor@@ der w@@ all so that we can trans@@ l@@ ate their inform@@ al pro@@ cess@@ es of urb@@ ani@@ z@@ ation ."
What do I mean by the inform@@ al in this case ?
"I &apos;m talking simply about the cre@@ ative inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence of the bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up , whether m@@ ani@@ fe@@ st@@ ed in the s@@ lu@@ ms of Ti@@ ju@@ ana that build themselves , in fact , with the wa@@ ste of S@@ an D@@ iego , or the many mi@@ gr@@ ant neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods in S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n C@@ alifor@@ nia that have be@@ gu@@ n to be re@@ tro@@ fi@@ t@@ ted with difference in the last de@@ ca@@ des ."
"So I &apos;ve been interested as an arti@@ st in the meas@@ ur@@ ing , the obser@@ vation , of many of the trans@@ -@@ bor@@ der inform@@ al f@@ low@@ s across this bor@@ der : in one dire@@ ction , from s@@ outh to nor@@ th , the f@@ low of im@@ mi@@ gran@@ ts into the United States , and from nor@@ th to s@@ outh the f@@ low of wa@@ ste from s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n C@@ alifor@@ nia into Ti@@ ju@@ ana ."
I &apos;m re@@ fer@@ ring to the re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling of these old post@@ -@@ war bu@@ n@@ gal@@ ow@@ s that M@@ exi@@ can con@@ trac@@ t@@ ors bring to the bor@@ der as American develo@@ per@@ s are di@@ spos@@ ing of them in the process of building a more in@@ f@@ lated ver@@ sion of su@@ bur@@ bi@@ a in the last de@@ ca@@ des .
So these are h@@ ous@@ es wai@@ ting to c@@ ross the bor@@ der .
"N@@ ot only people c@@ ross the bor@@ der here , but entire ch@@ un@@ ks of one city move to the next , and when these h@@ ous@@ es are plac@@ ed on top of these ste@@ el fra@@ mes , they leave the first flo@@ or to become the second to be in@@ -@@ fil@@ led with more house , with a small business ."
This la@@ y@@ ering of sp@@ ac@@ es and econom@@ ies is very interesting to noti@@ ce .
"But not only h@@ ous@@ es , also small de@@ br@@ is from one city , from S@@ an D@@ iego , to Ti@@ ju@@ ana ."
P@@ rob@@ ably a lot of you have seen the ru@@ b@@ ber ti@@ res that are used in the s@@ lu@@ ms to build re@@ ta@@ ining wal@@ ls .
But look at what people have done here in con@@ di@@ tions of so@@ ci@@ o@@ economic em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy .
"They have figu@@ red out how to pe@@ el off the ti@@ re , how to th@@ read it and inter@@ lo@@ ck it to con@@ stru@@ ct a more ef@@ fi@@ cient re@@ ta@@ ining w@@ all ."
I don &apos;t want to ro@@ man@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze po@@ ver@@ ty .
They tru@@ ly per@@ form as they trans@@ form through time and as communi@@ ties neg@@ oti@@ ate the sp@@ ac@@ es and b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies and re@@ sources .
"So while wa@@ ste f@@ low@@ s s@@ ou@@ th@@ b@@ ound , people go nor@@ th in sear@@ ch of dollars , and most of my research has had to do with the impac@@ t of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation in the alter@@ ation of the hom@@ og@@ ene@@ ity of many neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods in the United States , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly in S@@ an D@@ iego ."
"And I &apos;m talking about how this begin@@ s to su@@ ggest that the future of S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n C@@ alifor@@ nia depen@@ ds on the re@@ tro@@ fi@@ tting of the large urb@@ ani@@ z@@ ation — I mean , on ster@@ o@@ i@@ ds — with the small progra@@ ms , social and economic ."
"I &apos;m re@@ fer@@ ring to how im@@ mi@@ gran@@ ts , when they come to these neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods , they beg@@ in to al@@ ter the one@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ on@@ ality of par@@ cel@@ s and pro@@ per@@ ties into more so@@ cially and econ@@ omi@@ cally comple@@ x systems , as they beg@@ in to p@@ lu@@ g an inform@@ al econom@@ y into a gar@@ age , or as they build an il@@ leg@@ al gran@@ ny f@@ lat to sup@@ port an ex@@ ten@@ ded family ."
"This so@@ ci@@ o@@ economic ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship on the ground within these neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods really begin@@ s to su@@ ggest ways of trans@@ lat@@ ing that into new , inclu@@ sive and more equ@@ it@@ able land use poli@@ cies ."
"Wi@@ th sho@@ v@@ els in hand , they started to di@@ g ."
"T@@ wo weeks later , the poli@@ ce stop@@ ped them ."
The first thing they did was to re@@ cogni@@ ze the speci@@ fi@@ city of poli@@ tical ju@@ ri@@ s@@ di@@ ction in@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed in that em@@ p@@ ty space .
They found out that they had been lu@@ ck@@ y because they had not be@@ gu@@ n to di@@ g under C@@ al@@ tr@@ ans terri@@ to@@ y .
"C@@ al@@ tr@@ ans is a state ag@@ en@@ cy that gover@@ ns the fre@@ e@@ way , so it would have been very difficult to neg@@ oti@@ ate with them ."
"They were lu@@ ck@@ y , they said , because they began to di@@ g under an ar@@ m of the fre@@ e@@ way that be@@ lon@@ gs to the local muni@@ ci@@ p@@ ality ."
All these red lin@@ es are the in@@ visi@@ ble poli@@ tical institu@@ tions that were in@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed in that le@@ f@@ to@@ ver em@@ p@@ ty space .
"Wi@@ th this know@@ le@@ dge , these te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers as sk@@ at@@ ers con@@ fron@@ ted the city ."
They came to the city at@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s offi@@ ce .
"The city at@@ tor@@ ney told them that in order to contin@@ ue the neg@@ oti@@ ation they had to become an N@@ G@@ O , and of course they didn &apos;t know what an N@@ G@@ O was ."
They had to talk to their friends in Se@@ at@@ tle who had gone through the same experience .
"And they began to realize the ne@@ ces@@ sity to organi@@ ze themselves even de@@ e@@ per and began to fun@@ dra@@ ise , to organi@@ ze bud@@ gets , to really be aw@@ are of all the know@@ le@@ dge em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the urb@@ an c@@ od@@ e in S@@ an D@@ iego so that they could beg@@ in to re@@ def@@ ine the very me@@ an@@ ing of public space in the city , ex@@ pan@@ ding it to other c@@ ate@@ gor@@ ies ."
"They also t@@ au@@ ght me that si@@ mi@@ lar to the mi@@ gr@@ ant communi@@ ties on both si@@ des of the bor@@ der , they eng@@ aged con@@ fli@@ ct itself as a cre@@ ative to@@ ol , because they had to produ@@ ce a process that en@@ ab@@ led them to re@@ organi@@ ze re@@ sources and the poli@@ ti@@ cs of the city ."
Now this jour@@ ney from the bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up to the trans@@ form@@ ation of the top@@ -@@ down is where I find hope today .
( Applause )
"If you &apos;d like to learn how to play the lob@@ ster , we have some here ."
"And that &apos;s not a jo@@ ke , we really do ."
So come up af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds and I &apos;ll show you how to play a lob@@ ster .
"So , actually , I started working on what &apos;s called the man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p a few years ago because they make sound ."
This is a recor@@ ding I made of a man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p that &apos;s found off the co@@ ast of C@@ alifor@@ nia .
"And while that &apos;s an absolu@@ tely fas@@ cin@@ ating sound , it actually turns out to be a very difficult project ."
"And while I was stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing to figure out how and why man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , or st@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ po@@ ds , make sound , I started to think about their app@@ en@@ d@@ ages ."
"And man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p are called &quot; &quot; man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p &quot; &quot; after the pra@@ ying man@@ ti@@ ses , which also have a f@@ ast fe@@ e@@ ding app@@ en@@ d@@ age . And I started to think , well , maybe it will be interesting , while list@@ ening to their sounds , to figure out how these animals gener@@ ate very f@@ ast fe@@ e@@ ding stri@@ k@@ es ."
"And so today I &apos;ll talk about the extre@@ me st@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ pod stri@@ ke , work that I &apos;ve done in col@@ labor@@ ation with Wy@@ at@@ t K@@ or@@ ff and Ro@@ y C@@ al@@ d@@ well ."
"So , man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p come in two v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties : there are spe@@ ar@@ ers and s@@ mas@@ h@@ ers ."
"And this is a spe@@ aring man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , or st@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ pod ."
"And he lives in the s@@ and , and he cat@@ ch@@ es things that go by over@@ head ."
"So , a qui@@ ck stri@@ ke like that . And if we s@@ low it down a bit , this is the man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p — the same species — recor@@ ded at 1@@ ,000 fra@@ mes a second , pla@@ yed back at 15 fra@@ mes per second ."
"And you can see it &apos;s just a really spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar ex@@ ten@@ sion of the lim@@ b@@ s , ex@@ plo@@ ding up@@ ward to actually just cat@@ ch a de@@ ad piece of sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p that I had of@@ fer@@ ed it ."
"Now , the other ty@@ pe of man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p is the s@@ mas@@ her st@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ pod , and these guys open up s@@ na@@ il@@ s for a living ."
And so this guy gets the s@@ na@@ il all set up and gi@@ ves it a good wh@@ ack .
"( Laughter ) So , I &apos;ll play it one more time ."
"He wi@@ gg@@ les it in place , tu@@ gs it with his no@@ se , and s@@ mas@@ h ."
"And a few s@@ mas@@ h@@ es later , the s@@ na@@ il is bro@@ k@@ en open , and he &apos;s got a good din@@ ner ."
"So , the s@@ mas@@ her ra@@ p@@ t@@ ori@@ al app@@ en@@ d@@ age can sta@@ b with a point at the end , or it can s@@ mas@@ h with the he@@ el ."
And today I &apos;ll talk about the s@@ mas@@ h@@ ing ty@@ pe of stri@@ ke .
"And so the first question that came to mind was , well , how f@@ ast does this lim@@ b move ?"
Because it &apos;s moving pretty dar@@ n f@@ ast on that video .
And I im@@ medi@@ ately came upo@@ n a problem .
E@@ very single high-@@ speed video system in the bio@@ logy de@@ part@@ ment at B@@ er@@ k@@ ele@@ y wasn &apos;t f@@ ast enough to cat@@ ch this movement .
We simply couldn &apos;t cap@@ ture it on video .
And so this had me sty@@ mie@@ d for quite a long per@@ i@@ od of time .
"And then a B@@ B@@ C cre@@ w came c@@ ru@@ is@@ ing through the bio@@ logy de@@ part@@ ment , looking for a story to do about new technolog@@ ies in bio@@ logy ."
And so we stru@@ ck up a deal .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you guys r@@ ent the high-@@ speed video system that could cap@@ ture these mov@@ em@@ ents , you guys can film us colle@@ cting the data . &quot; &quot; And believe it or not , they went for it . ( Laughter ) So we got this incredible video system . It &apos;s very new technology — it just came out about a year ago — that allow@@ s you to film at extre@@ me@@ ly high spe@@ eds in low light ."
"And low light is a cri@@ tical issue with fil@@ ming animals , because if it &apos;s too high , you f@@ ry them . ( Laughter ) So this is a man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p . There are the eyes up here , and there &apos;s that ra@@ p@@ t@@ ori@@ al app@@ en@@ d@@ age , and there &apos;s the he@@ el ."
And that thing &apos;s going to s@@ w@@ ing around and s@@ mas@@ h the s@@ na@@ il .
"And the s@@ na@@ il &apos;s wi@@ red to a sti@@ ck , so he &apos;s a little bit e@@ as@@ ier to set up the sh@@ ot . And — ye@@ ah ."
( Laughter ) I hope there ar@@ en &apos;t any s@@ na@@ il ri@@ ghts acti@@ vi@@ sts around here . ( Laughter )
"So this was fil@@ med at 5@@ ,000 fra@@ mes per second , and I &apos;m playing it back at 15 . And so this is s@@ low@@ ed down 3@@ 3@@ 3 times ."
"And as you &apos;ll noti@@ ce , it &apos;s still pretty go@@ sh dar@@ n f@@ ast s@@ low@@ ed down 3@@ 3@@ 3 times . It &apos;s an incredi@@ bly powerful movement ."
The whole lim@@ b ex@@ ten@@ ds out . The body f@@ le@@ x@@ es back@@ war@@ ds — just a spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar movement .
"And so what we did is , we took a look at these vi@@ de@@ os , and we meas@@ u@@ red how f@@ ast the lim@@ b was moving to get back to that ori@@ gin@@ al question ."
And we were in for our first sur@@ pri@@ se .
So what we cal@@ cu@@ lated was that the lim@@ b@@ s were moving at the pe@@ ak speed r@@ ang@@ ing from 10 me@@ ters per second all the way up to 2@@ 3 me@@ ters per second .
"And for those of you who pre@@ f@@ er miles per hour , that &apos;s over 4@@ 5 miles per hour in water . And this is really dar@@ n f@@ ast ."
"In fact , it &apos;s so f@@ ast we were able to ad@@ d a new point on the extre@@ me ani@@ mal movement spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m ."
And man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p are offi@@ cially the f@@ ast@@ est meas@@ u@@ red fe@@ e@@ ding stri@@ ke of any ani@@ mal system . So our first sur@@ pri@@ se .
( Applause ) So that was really cool and very u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted .
"So , you might be wonder@@ ing , well , how do they do it ?"
"And actually , this work was done in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s by a fam@@ ous biologi@@ st na@@ med M@@ al@@ col@@ m Bu@@ r@@ row@@ s ."
"And what he show@@ ed in man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p is that they use what &apos;s called a &quot; &quot; cat@@ ch mechani@@ sm , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; cli@@ ck mechani@@ sm . &quot; &quot; And what this basically consi@@ sts of is a large mus@@ cle that takes a good long time to con@@ trac@@ t , and a lat@@ ch that pre@@ v@@ ents anything from moving ."
"So the mus@@ cle con@@ trac@@ ts , and nothing happens ."
"And once the mus@@ cle &apos;s con@@ trac@@ ted completely , everything &apos;s sto@@ red up — the lat@@ ch fl@@ ies up@@ ward , and you &apos;ve got the movement ."
"And that &apos;s basically what &apos;s called a &quot; &quot; power am@@ pli@@ fi@@ cation system . &quot; &quot; It takes a long time for the mus@@ cle to con@@ trac@@ t , and a very shor@@ t time for the lim@@ b to f@@ ly out ."
And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story .
This was how man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ ps make these very f@@ ast stri@@ k@@ es .
But then I took a tri@@ p to the N@@ ational M@@ us@@ e@@ um of N@@ at@@ u@@ ral Hi@@ story .
"And if any of you ever have a ch@@ ance , back@@ st@@ age of the N@@ ational M@@ us@@ e@@ um of N@@ at@@ u@@ ral Hi@@ story is one of the world &apos;s best colle@@ ctions of pre@@ ser@@ ved man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p . And what — ( Laughter ) this is seri@@ ous business for me . ( Laughter )"
"So , this — what I saw , on every single man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p lim@@ b , whether it &apos;s a spe@@ ar@@ er or a s@@ mas@@ her , is a beautiful s@@ ad@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ sha@@ ped structure right on the top surface of the lim@@ b . And you can see it right here ."
It just looks like a s@@ ad@@ d@@ le you &apos;d put on a hor@@ se .
It &apos;s a very beautiful structure .
And it &apos;s sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by mem@@ bran@@ ous are@@ as . And those mem@@ bran@@ ous are@@ as su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed to me that maybe this is some kind of dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cally f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble structure .
And this really sort of had me sc@@ rat@@ ching my head for a while .
"And then we did a ser@@ ies of cal@@ cul@@ ations , and what we were able to show is that these man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p have to have a sp@@ ring ."
"There needs to be some kind of sp@@ r@@ ing@@ -@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed mechani@@ sm in order to gener@@ ate the amount of force that we obser@@ ve , and the speed that we obser@@ ve , and the out@@ put of the system ."
"So we thought , OK , this must be a sp@@ ring — the s@@ ad@@ d@@ le could very well be a sp@@ ring ."
"And we went back to those high-@@ speed vi@@ de@@ os again , and we could actually vi@@ su@@ ali@@ ze the s@@ ad@@ d@@ le com@@ pres@@ sing and ex@@ ten@@ ding ."
And I &apos;ll just do that one more time .
And then if you take a look at the video — it &apos;s a little bit hard to see — it &apos;s out@@ lin@@ ed in y@@ el@@ low .
"The s@@ ad@@ d@@ le is out@@ lin@@ ed in y@@ el@@ low . You can actually see it ex@@ ten@@ ding over the course of the stri@@ ke , and actually hy@@ per@@ ex@@ ten@@ ding ."
"So , we &apos;ve had very so@@ li@@ d evi@@ dence show@@ ing that that s@@ ad@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ sha@@ ped structure actually com@@ pres@@ ses and ex@@ ten@@ ds , and does , in fact , fun@@ ction as a sp@@ ring ."
"The s@@ ad@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ sha@@ ped structure is also known as a &quot; &quot; hy@@ per@@ bo@@ li@@ c par@@ ab@@ o@@ lo@@ id surface , &quot; &quot; or an &quot; &quot; anti@@ c@@ la@@ stic surface . &quot; &quot; And this is very well known to engine@@ ers and archite@@ cts , because it &apos;s a very stron@@ g surface in com@@ pres@@ sion ."
"It has cur@@ ves in two dire@@ ctions , one cur@@ ve up@@ ward and op@@ posi@@ te trans@@ verse cur@@ ve down the other , so any kind of per@@ tur@@ b@@ ation sp@@ re@@ ads the for@@ ces over the surface of this ty@@ pe of sha@@ pe ."
"So it &apos;s very well known to engine@@ ers , not as well known to biologi@@ sts ."
"It &apos;s also known to quite a few people who make je@@ wel@@ ry , because it requi@@ res very little materi@@ al to build this ty@@ pe of surface , and it &apos;s very stron@@ g ."
"So if you &apos;re going to build a th@@ in g@@ old structure , it &apos;s very nice to have it in a sha@@ pe that &apos;s stron@@ g ."
"Now , it &apos;s also known to archite@@ cts . One of the most fam@@ ous archite@@ cts is E@@ du@@ ar@@ do C@@ at@@ al@@ ano , who po@@ pu@@ lar@@ i@@ zed this structure ."
And what &apos;s sh@@ own here is a s@@ ad@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ sha@@ ped ro@@ of that he built that &apos;s 8@@ 7 and a half fe@@ et sp@@ an@@ wi@@ se .
"It &apos;s two and a half in@@ ch@@ es thi@@ ck , and sup@@ por@@ ted at two poin@@ ts ."
And one of the reas@@ ons why he desig@@ ned ro@@ of@@ s this way is because it &apos;s — he found it fas@@ cin@@ ating that you could build such a stron@@ g structure that &apos;s made of so few materi@@ als and can be sup@@ por@@ ted by so few poin@@ ts .
And all of these are the same prin@@ ci@@ ples that app@@ ly to the s@@ ad@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ sha@@ ped sp@@ ring in st@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ po@@ ds .
In biologi@@ cal systems it &apos;s important not to have a whole lot of ex@@ tra materi@@ al requi@@ re@@ ments for building it .
"So , very interesting par@@ al@@ le@@ ls between the biologi@@ cal and the engine@@ ering wor@@ l@@ ds . And interest@@ ing@@ ly , this turns out — the st@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ pod s@@ ad@@ d@@ le turns out to be the first descri@@ bed biologi@@ cal hy@@ per@@ bo@@ li@@ c par@@ ab@@ o@@ lo@@ id sp@@ ring ."
"That &apos;s a bit long , but it is sort of interesting ."
"So the next and fin@@ al question was , well , how much force does a man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p produ@@ ce if they &apos;re able to bre@@ ak open s@@ na@@ il@@ s ?"
And so I wi@@ red up what &apos;s called a lo@@ ad cell .
"A lo@@ ad cell meas@@ ures for@@ ces , and this is actually a pie@@ z@@ o@@ ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic lo@@ ad cell that has a little c@@ r@@ yst@@ al in it ."
"And when this c@@ r@@ yst@@ al is squ@@ e@@ e@@ zed , the electri@@ cal pro@@ per@@ ties change and it — which — in pro@@ por@@ tion to the for@@ ces that go in ."
"So these animals are wonder@@ fully ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sive , and are really hun@@ g@@ ry all the time . And so all I had to do was actually put a little sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p pa@@ ste on the front of the lo@@ ad cell , and they &apos;d s@@ mas@@ h away at it ."
And so this is just a regu@@ lar video of the ani@@ mal just s@@ mas@@ h@@ ing the he@@ ck out of this lo@@ ad cell .
And we were able to get some force meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments out .
"And again , we were in for a sur@@ pri@@ se ."
"I pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ed a 10@@ 0-@@ po@@ u@@ nd lo@@ ad cell , thinking , no ani@@ mal could produ@@ ce more than 100 po@@ un@@ ds at this size of an ani@@ mal ."
And what do you know ? They im@@ medi@@ ately over@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed the lo@@ ad cell .
"So these are actually some old data where I had to find the s@@ mal@@ l@@ est animals in the la@@ b , and we were able to meas@@ ure for@@ ces of well over 100 po@@ un@@ ds gener@@ ated by an ani@@ mal about this big ."
"And actually , just last week I got a 3@@ 0@@ 0-@@ po@@ u@@ nd lo@@ ad cell up and ru@@ n@@ ning , and I &apos;ve clo@@ cked these animals gener@@ ating well over 2@@ 00 po@@ un@@ ds of force ."
"And again , I think this will be a world recor@@ d ."
"I have to do a little bit more back@@ ground re@@ ading , but I think this will be the largest amount of force produ@@ ced by an ani@@ mal of a given — per body mas@@ s . So , really incredible for@@ ces ."
"And again , that br@@ ings us back to the import@@ ance of that sp@@ ring in stor@@ ing up and rele@@ as@@ ing so much energy in this system ."
But that was not the end of the story .
"Now , things — I &apos;m making this sound very e@@ asy , this is actually a lot of work ."
"And I got all these force meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , and then I went and looked at the force out@@ put of the system ."
And this is just very simple — time is on the X@@ -@@ ax@@ is and the force is on the Y@@ -@@ ax@@ is . And you can see two pe@@ ak@@ s .
And that was what really got me pu@@ z@@ z@@ led .
"The first pe@@ ak , obvi@@ ously , is the lim@@ b hi@@ tting the lo@@ ad cell ."
"But there &apos;s a really large second pe@@ ak half a mi@@ lli@@ second later , and I didn &apos;t know what that was ."
"So now , you &apos;d expe@@ ct a second pe@@ ak for other reas@@ ons , but not half a mi@@ lli@@ second later ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , going back to those high-@@ speed vi@@ de@@ os , there &apos;s a pretty good h@@ int of what might be going on ."
Here &apos;s that same or@@ ien@@ tation that we saw ear@@ lie@@ r .
"There &apos;s that ra@@ p@@ t@@ ori@@ al app@@ en@@ d@@ age — there &apos;s the he@@ el , and it &apos;s going to s@@ w@@ ing around and h@@ it the lo@@ ad cell ."
"And what I &apos;d like you to do in this sh@@ ot is keep your ey@@ e on this , on the surface of the lo@@ ad cell , as the lim@@ b comes fl@@ ying through ."
And I hope what you are able to see is actually a f@@ las@@ h of light .
A@@ ud@@ ience : W@@ ow .
"S@@ he@@ il@@ a P@@ ate@@ k : And so if we just take that one fra@@ me , what you can actually see there at the end of that y@@ el@@ low ar@@ row is a v@@ apo@@ r bu@@ b@@ ble ."
"And what that is , is ca@@ vi@@ tation ."
And ca@@ vi@@ tation is an extre@@ me@@ ly pot@@ ent flu@@ id dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on which oc@@ cur@@ s when you have are@@ as of water moving at extre@@ me@@ ly different spe@@ eds .
"And when this happens , it can cause are@@ as of very low pres@@ sure , which resul@@ ts in the water liter@@ ally v@@ apo@@ ri@@ z@@ ing ."
"And when that v@@ apo@@ r bu@@ b@@ ble col@@ lap@@ ses , it e@@ mi@@ ts sound , light and he@@ at , and it &apos;s a very de@@ stru@@ ctive process ."
"And so here it is in the st@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ pod . And again , this is a situ@@ ation where engine@@ ers are very fami@@ li@@ ar with this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on , because it de@@ stro@@ ys boat pro@@ pe@@ ll@@ ers ."
"P@@ e@@ ople have been stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing for years to try and design a very f@@ ast ro@@ t@@ ating boat pro@@ pe@@ l@@ ler that doesn &apos;t ca@@ vi@@ t@@ ate and liter@@ ally we@@ ar away the me@@ tal and put ho@@ les in it , just like these pi@@ ctures show ."
"So this is a pot@@ ent force in flu@@ id systems , and just to sort of take it one ste@@ p f@@ ur@@ ther , I &apos;m going to show you the man@@ t@@ is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p appro@@ ach@@ ing the s@@ na@@ il ."
"This is taken at 20@@ ,000 fra@@ mes per second , and I have to give full cre@@ d@@ it to the B@@ B@@ C cam@@ er@@ am@@ an , T@@ im Gre@@ en , for se@@ tting this sh@@ ot up , because I could never have done this in a million years — one of the b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts of working with prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal cam@@ er@@ am@@ en ."
"You can see it coming in , and an incredible f@@ las@@ h of light , and all this ca@@ vi@@ tation sp@@ re@@ ading over the surface of the s@@ na@@ il ."
"So really , just an amazing image , s@@ low@@ ed down extre@@ me@@ ly , to extre@@ me@@ ly s@@ low spe@@ eds ."
"And again , we can see it in sli@@ gh@@ tly different form there , with the bu@@ b@@ ble form@@ ing and col@@ lap@@ sing between those two sur@@ fac@@ es ."
"In fact , you might have even seen some ca@@ vi@@ tation going up the ed@@ ge of the lim@@ b ."
"So to sol@@ ve this qu@@ and@@ ary of the two force pe@@ ak@@ s : what I think was going on is : that first impac@@ t is actually the lim@@ b hi@@ tting the lo@@ ad cell , and the second impac@@ t is actually the col@@ lap@@ se of the ca@@ vi@@ tation bu@@ b@@ ble ."
"And these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy sto@@ red with that speci@@ aliz@@ ed sp@@ ring , but the extre@@ mes of the flu@@ id dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs . And they might actually be making use of flu@@ id dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs as a second force for bre@@ aking the s@@ na@@ il ."
"So , really fas@@ cin@@ ating d@@ ou@@ ble wh@@ am@@ my , so to speak , from these animals ."
"So , one question I often get after this talk — so I figu@@ red I &apos;d answer it now — is , well , what happens to the ani@@ mal ?"
"Because obvi@@ ously , if it &apos;s bre@@ aking s@@ na@@ il@@ s , the po@@ or lim@@ b must be dis@@ inte@@ gr@@ ating . And in@@ de@@ ed it does ."
"That &apos;s the s@@ mas@@ h@@ ing part of the he@@ el on both these images , and it gets wor@@ n away . In fact , I &apos;ve seen them we@@ ar away their he@@ el all the way to the fl@@ es@@ h ."
"But one of the con@@ ven@@ ien@@ t things about being an ar@@ th@@ ro@@ pod is that you have to mo@@ l@@ t . And every three months or so these animals mo@@ l@@ t , and they build a new lim@@ b and it &apos;s no problem ."
"@@ V@@ ery , very con@@ ven@@ ien@@ t solution to that particular problem ."
"So , I &apos;d like to end on sort of a w@@ ac@@ k@@ y not@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) Ma@@ ybe this is all w@@ ac@@ k@@ y to fol@@ ks like you , I don &apos;t know . ( Laughter )"
"So , the s@@ ad@@ d@@ les — that s@@ ad@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ sha@@ ped sp@@ ring — has actually been well known to biologi@@ sts for a long time , not as a sp@@ ring but as a vi@@ su@@ al sig@@ na@@ l ."
And there &apos;s actually a spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar co@@ lo@@ red do@@ t in the cen@@ ter of the s@@ ad@@ d@@ les of many species of st@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ po@@ ds .
"And this is quite interesting , to find ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary ori@@ gin@@ s of vi@@ su@@ al sig@@ n@@ als on what &apos;s really , in all species , their sp@@ ring ."
And I think one ex@@ plan@@ ation for this could be going back to the mo@@ l@@ ting ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
So these animals go into a mo@@ l@@ ting per@@ i@@ od where they &apos;re u@@ na@@ ble to stri@@ ke — their bod@@ ies become very so@@ ft .
And they &apos;re liter@@ ally u@@ na@@ ble to stri@@ ke or they will self-@@ de@@ stru@@ ct .
"This is for real . And what they do is , up until that time per@@ i@@ od when they can &apos;t stri@@ ke , they become really ob@@ no@@ x@@ i@@ ous and aw@@ ful , and they stri@@ ke everything in si@@ ght ; it doesn &apos;t matter who or what ."
"And the second they get into that time point when they can &apos;t stri@@ ke any more , they just sig@@ na@@ l . They wa@@ ve their le@@ gs around ."
And it &apos;s one of the clas@@ si@@ c exam@@ ples in ani@@ mal behavi@@ or of blu@@ f@@ f@@ ing .
"It &apos;s a wel@@ l-@@ est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed fact of these animals that they actually blu@@ ff . They can &apos;t actually stri@@ ke , but they pre@@ ten@@ d to ."
"And so I &apos;m very cu@@ ri@@ ous about whether those co@@ lo@@ red d@@ ots in the cen@@ ter of the s@@ ad@@ d@@ les are con@@ ve@@ ying some kind of information about their ability to stri@@ ke , or their stri@@ ke force , and something about the time per@@ i@@ od in the mo@@ l@@ ting cy@@ cle ."
So sort of an interesting str@@ ange fact to find a vi@@ su@@ al structure right in the mi@@ ddle of their sp@@ ring .
"So to con@@ clu@@ de , I mo@@ st@@ ly want to ac@@ know@@ le@@ dge my two col@@ labor@@ at@@ ors , Wy@@ at@@ t K@@ or@@ ff and Ro@@ y C@@ al@@ d@@ well , who worked clo@@ se@@ ly with me on this ."
"And also the M@@ il@@ ler In@@ stitu@@ te for B@@ a@@ si@@ c R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch in S@@ cien@@ ce , which gave me three years of fun@@ ding to just do science all the time , and for that I &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful . Thank you very much ."
( Applause )
"I &apos;m a mar@@ ine biologi@@ st and an expl@@ or@@ er@@ -@@ photograph@@ er with N@@ ational G@@ e@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c , but I want to share a se@@ cre@@ t ."
"This image is tot@@ ally in@@ cor@@ re@@ ct , tot@@ ally in@@ cor@@ re@@ ct ."
I see a couple of people c@@ ry@@ ing in the back that I &apos;ve b@@ low@@ n their idea of mer@@ ma@@ i@@ ds .
"A@@ ll right , the mer@@ ma@@ id is in@@ de@@ ed real , but any@@ one who &apos;s gone on a di@@ ve will know that the ocean looks more like this ."
"It &apos;s because the ocean is this mas@@ sive fil@@ ter , and as so@@ on as you start going under@@ water , you &apos;re going to lo@@ se your col@@ ors , and it &apos;s going to get dar@@ k and blue very quickly ."
But we &apos;re hum@@ ans — we &apos;re ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al m@@ am@@ m@@ als .
"And we &apos;ve got tri@@ chro@@ m@@ atic vision , so we see in red , green and blue , and we &apos;re just comple@@ te color ad@@ di@@ cts ."
"We love e@@ ye@@ -@@ po@@ pping color , and we try to bring this e@@ ye@@ -@@ po@@ pping color under@@ water with us ."
"So there &apos;s been a long and sor@@ did history of br@@ ing@@ ing color under@@ water , and it star@@ ts 8@@ 8 years ago with Bi@@ ll Lon@@ g@@ ley and Ch@@ ar@@ les Mar@@ t@@ in , who were trying to take the first under@@ water color photogra@@ ph ."
"I mean , it &apos;s a gor@@ ge@@ ous image , but this is not real ."
They &apos;re cre@@ ating an arti@@ fi@@ cial environment so we can s@@ ati@@ s@@ fy our own ad@@ di@@ ction to color .
"And looking at it the other way , what we &apos;ve been fin@@ ding is that instead of br@@ ing@@ ing color under@@ water with us , that we &apos;ve been looking at the blue ocean , and it &apos;s a c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ble of blue , and these animals living there for mi@@ llions of years have been ev@@ ol@@ ving all sor@@ ts of ways to take in that blue light and give off other col@@ ors ."
And here &apos;s just a little sam@@ ple of what this se@@ cre@@ t world looks like .
It &apos;s like an under@@ water light show .
"( Music ) A@@ ga@@ in , what we &apos;re seeing here is blue light hi@@ tting this image ."
These animals are ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing the blue light and im@@ medi@@ ately trans@@ form@@ ing this light .
"So if you think about it , the ocean is 7@@ 1 percent of the planet , and blue light can ex@@ ten@@ d down to almost a 1@@ ,000 me@@ ters ."
"As we go down under@@ water , after about 10 me@@ ters , all the red is gone ."
"So if you see anything under 10 me@@ ters that &apos;s red , it &apos;s an ani@@ mal trans@@ form@@ ing and cre@@ ating its own red ."
This is the largest single mon@@ o@@ chro@@ m@@ atic blue environment on our planet .
And my g@@ ate@@ way into this world of bi@@ of@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ence begin@@ s with cor@@ als .
And I want to give a full TED T@@ al@@ k on cor@@ als and just how cool these things are .
"One of the things that they do , one of their mi@@ rac@@ ul@@ ous fe@@ ats , is they produ@@ ce lots of these flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent prote@@ ins , flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les ."
"And in this cor@@ al , it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mas@@ s — could be this flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent prote@@ in ."
"So you wouldn &apos;t be making , like , 14 percent mus@@ cle and not using it , so it &apos;s li@@ ke@@ ly doing something that has a fun@@ cti@@ onal ro@@ le ."
"And for the last 10 , 15 years , this was so spe@@ cial to me , because this mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le has turned out to be one of the most re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary to@@ ols in bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal science , and it &apos;s allow@@ ing us to better see inside ourselves ."
"So , how do I study this ?"
"In order to study bi@@ of@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ence , we s@@ wi@@ m at night ."
"And when I started out , I was just using these blue du@@ ct@@ -@@ ta@@ pe fil@@ ters over my stro@@ be , so I could make sure I &apos;m actually seeing the light that &apos;s being trans@@ form@@ ed by the animals ."
"We &apos;re making an ex@@ hi@@ bit for the M@@ us@@ e@@ um of N@@ at@@ u@@ ral Hi@@ story , and we &apos;re trying to show off how great the flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent cor@@ als are on the re@@ e@@ f , and something happened that just b@@ le@@ w me away : this ."
"In the mi@@ ddle of our cor@@ als , is this green flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent fish ."
It &apos;s the first time we &apos;ve ever seen a green flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent fish or any ver@@ te@@ br@@ ate for that matter .
"And we &apos;re ru@@ b@@ b@@ ing our eyes , che@@ c@@ king the fil@@ ters , thinking that somebody &apos;s maybe playing a jo@@ ke on us with the cam@@ era , but the e@@ el was real ."
"It was the first green flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent e@@ el that we found , and this just changed my tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory completely ."
"So I had to put down my cor@@ als and team up with a fish scienti@@ st , Joh@@ n S@@ par@@ ks , and beg@@ in a sear@@ ch around the world to see how pre@@ val@@ ent this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on is ."
"And fish are much more interesting than cor@@ als , because they have really adv@@ an@@ ced vision , and some of the fish even have , the way that I was photograph@@ ing it , they have len@@ ses in their eyes that would mag@@ ni@@ fy the flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ence ."
So I wanted to se@@ ek this out f@@ ur@@ ther .
"So we desig@@ ned a new set of ge@@ ar and we &apos;re sc@@ our@@ ing the re@@ ef@@ s around the world , looking for flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent life ."
"And ev@@ en@@ tually , we found our ph@@ ot@@ ob@@ om@@ b@@ ing K@@ au@@ pi@@ ch@@ ph@@ ys e@@ el ."
"It &apos;s a really sh@@ y , re@@ clu@@ sive e@@ el that we know almost nothing about ."
"They &apos;re only about the size of my fin@@ ger , and they spend about 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 9 percent of their time hi@@ d@@ den under a ro@@ ck ."
"But these e@@ els do come out to m@@ ate under fu@@ ll@@ -@@ mo@@ on ni@@ ghts , and that fu@@ ll@@ -@@ mo@@ on night trans@@ lat@@ es under@@ water to blue ."
"P@@ er@@ haps they &apos;re using this as a way to see each other , quickly find each other , m@@ ate , go back into their ho@@ le for the next long st@@ int of time ."
"But then we started to find other flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent mar@@ ine life , like this green flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent bre@@ am , with its , like , rac@@ ing stri@@ p@@ es along its head and its na@@ pe , and it &apos;s almost cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ aged and flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ing at the same inten@@ sity as the flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent cor@@ al there ."
"A@@ f@@ ter this fish , we were in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced to this red flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent sc@@ or@@ pi@@ on@@ fish clo@@ ak@@ ed and hi@@ d@@ den on this ro@@ ck ."
"The only time we &apos;ve ever seen this , it &apos;s either on red flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent al@@ ga@@ e or red flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent cor@@ al ."
"L@@ ater , we found this ste@@ al@@ th@@ y green flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent li@@ zar@@ d@@ fish ."
"These li@@ zar@@ d@@ fish come in many v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties , and they look almost exactly ali@@ ke under white light ."
"But if you look at them under flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent light , you see lots of pat@@ ter@@ ns , you can really see the differ@@ ences am@@ ong them ."
And in tot@@ al — we just re@@ por@@ ted this last year — we found over 2@@ 00 species of bi@@ of@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent fish .
One of my in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ations is F@@ ren@@ ch arti@@ st and biologi@@ st Je@@ an P@@ a@@ in@@ le@@ v@@ é .
"He really cap@@ tu@@ res this ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ing , cre@@ ative sp@@ ir@@ it in bio@@ logy ."
"He would design his own ge@@ ar , make his own cam@@ er@@ as , and he was fas@@ cin@@ ated with the se@@ a@@ hor@@ se , Hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ pu@@ s er@@ e@@ ctu@@ s , and he fil@@ med for the first time the se@@ a@@ hor@@ se gi@@ ving bir@@ th ."
So this is the m@@ ale se@@ a@@ hor@@ se .
They were one of the first fish to start s@@ wi@@ m@@ ming up@@ right with their brain ab@@ o@@ ve their head .
"The mal@@ es give bir@@ th , just ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al cre@@ at@@ ures ."
So he sta@@ yed a@@ wa@@ ke for days .
"He even put this electri@@ cal vi@@ s@@ or on his head that would sho@@ ck him , so he could cap@@ ture this moment ."
"Now , I wi@@ sh I could have sh@@ own P@@ a@@ in@@ le@@ v@@ é the moment where we found bi@@ of@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent se@@ a@@ hor@@ ses in the ex@@ act same species that he was stu@@ dy@@ ing ."
And here &apos;s our fo@@ ot@@ age .
( Music ) They &apos;re the most c@@ ry@@ p@@ tic fish .
You could be s@@ wi@@ m@@ ming right on top of them and not see the se@@ a@@ hor@@ se .
"They would bl@@ end right into the al@@ ga@@ e , which would also flu@@ ore@@ s@@ ce red , but they &apos;ve got great vision , and they go through this long mat@@ ing ri@@ tu@@ al , and per@@ haps they &apos;re using it in that effe@@ ct ."
"But things got pretty ed@@ gy when we found green flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ence in the st@@ in@@ gra@@ y , because st@@ in@@ gra@@ ys are in the E@@ las@@ mo@@ bran@@ ch clas@@ s , which inclu@@ des ..."
sh@@ ar@@ ks .
"So I &apos;m , like , a cor@@ al biologi@@ st ."
S@@ ome@@ body &apos;s got to go down and che@@ ck to see if the sh@@ ar@@ ks are flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent .
And there I am .
"( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ybe I should go back to cor@@ als . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It turns out that these sh@@ ar@@ ks are not flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent ."
"In a de@@ ep , dar@@ k c@@ any@@ on off the co@@ ast of C@@ alifor@@ nia , we found the first bi@@ of@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent s@@ wel@@ l@@ sh@@ ar@@ k , right under@@ ne@@ ath all the sur@@ f@@ ers ."
Here it is .
They &apos;re just about a me@@ ter long . It &apos;s called a s@@ wel@@ l@@ sh@@ ar@@ k .
And here is our first fo@@ ot@@ age of these bi@@ of@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent s@@ wel@@ l@@ sh@@ ar@@ ks .
"J@@ ust mag@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent — I mean , they &apos;re show@@ ing these di@@ st@@ in@@ ct pat@@ ter@@ ns , and there are are@@ as that are flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent and are@@ as that are not flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent , but they &apos;ve also got these tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling spo@@ ts on them that are much bri@@ gh@@ ter than other par@@ ts of the sh@@ ar@@ k ."
But this is all beautiful to see .
"I was like , this is gor@@ ge@@ ous ."
But what does it mean to the sh@@ ar@@ k ?
C@@ an they see this ?
"And we looked in the liter@@ ature , and nothing was known about this sh@@ ar@@ k &apos;s vision ."
"So I took this sh@@ ar@@ k to ey@@ e speci@@ ali@@ st E@@ ll@@ is L@@ o@@ e@@ w at C@@ or@@ ne@@ ll Uni@@ versity , and we found out that this sh@@ ar@@ k se@@ es di@@ scre@@ tely and ac@@ u@@ tely in the blu@@ e-@@ green inter@@ face , probably about 100 times better than we can see in the dar@@ k , but they only see blu@@ e-@@ green ."
"So what it &apos;s doing is taking this blue world and it &apos;s ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing the blue , cre@@ ating green ."
It &apos;s cre@@ ating con@@ tra@@ st that they can in@@ de@@ ed see .
"So we have a model , show@@ ing that it cre@@ ates an ability for them to see all these pat@@ ter@@ ns ."
"And mal@@ es and fe@@ mal@@ es also have , we &apos;re fin@@ ding , di@@ st@@ in@@ ct pat@@ ter@@ ns am@@ ong them ."
"But our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now , in the S@@ ol@@ om@@ on Is@@ l@@ ands ."
"S@@ wi@@ m@@ ming at night , I en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed the first bi@@ of@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent se@@ a tur@@ tle ."
"So now it &apos;s going from fish and sh@@ ar@@ ks into re@@ p@@ ti@@ les , which , again , this is only one mon@@ th old , but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this ha@@ w@@ k@@ s@@ bi@@ ll tur@@ tle &apos;s vision ."
And it makes me think about how much more there is to learn .
"And here in the S@@ ol@@ om@@ on Is@@ l@@ ands , there &apos;s only a few thous@@ and bre@@ e@@ ding fe@@ mal@@ es of this species left , and this is one of the hot@@ spo@@ ts for them ."
"So it shows us how much we need to really prote@@ ct these animals while they &apos;re still here , and understand them ."
"In thinking about bi@@ of@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ence , I wanted to know , how de@@ ep does it go ?"
D@@ o@@ es this go all the way to the bot@@ tom of the ocean ?
"So we started using sub@@ mar@@ ines , and we e@@ qui@@ pped them with spe@@ cial blue li@@ ghts on the front here ."
"And we dro@@ pped down , and we noti@@ ced one important thing — that as we get down to 1@@ ,000 me@@ ters , it dro@@ ps off ."
"There &apos;s no bi@@ of@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent mar@@ ine life down there , be@@ low 1@@ ,000 me@@ ters — almost nothing , it &apos;s just dar@@ k@@ ness ."
So it &apos;s ma@@ in@@ ly a sh@@ al@@ low ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
"And be@@ low 1@@ ,000 me@@ ters , we en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed the bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent z@@ one , where n@@ ine out of 10 animals are actually making their own li@@ ghts and f@@ las@@ h@@ ing and b@@ lin@@ king ."
"As I try to get de@@ e@@ per , this is s@@ la@@ pping on a one@@ -@@ person sub@@ mar@@ ine su@@ it — some people call this my &quot; &quot; J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u me@@ ets W@@ o@@ ody Al@@ le@@ n &quot; &quot; moment ."
"( Laughter ) But as we expl@@ ore down here , I was thinking about : How do we inter@@ act with life de@@ lic@@ ately ?"
"Because we &apos;re en@@ ter@@ ing a new age of expl@@ or@@ ation , where we have to take great care , and we have to set exam@@ ples how we expl@@ ore ."
"So I &apos;ve te@@ am@@ ed up with rob@@ oti@@ ci@@ st Ro@@ b W@@ o@@ od at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard Uni@@ versity , and we &apos;ve been desig@@ ning s@@ qui@@ sh@@ y under@@ water robot fin@@ g@@ ers , so we can de@@ lic@@ ately inter@@ act with the mar@@ ine life down there ."
"The idea is that most of our technolog@@ ies to expl@@ ore the de@@ ep ocean come from oil and gas and mi@@ lit@@ ary , who , you know , they &apos;re not really car@@ ing to be g@@ ent@@ le ."
"S@@ ome cor@@ als could be 1@@ ,000 years old ."
You don &apos;t want to just go and c@@ rus@@ h them with a big c@@ la@@ w .
So my dre@@ am is something like this .
"A@@ t night , I &apos;m in a sub@@ mar@@ ine , I have for@@ ce@@ -@@ fe@@ ed@@ back g@@ lo@@ ves , and I could de@@ lic@@ ately set up a la@@ b in the front of my sub@@ mar@@ ine , where the s@@ qui@@ sh@@ y robot fin@@ g@@ ers are de@@ lic@@ ately colle@@ cting and pu@@ tting things in j@@ ars , and we can con@@ du@@ ct our research ."
B@@ ack to the powerful ap@@ pl@@ ied app@@ lic@@ ations .
"H@@ ere , you &apos;re looking at a living brain that &apos;s using the DNA of flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent mar@@ ine cre@@ at@@ ures , this one from je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish and cor@@ als , to il@@ lu@@ min@@ ate the living brain and see its conne@@ ctions ."
"And even more min@@ d-@@ b@@ low@@ ing , is my close colle@@ ag@@ ue V@@ in@@ cent P@@ ie@@ ri@@ b@@ one at Y@@ ale , who has actually desig@@ ned and engine@@ er@@ ed a flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent prote@@ in that respon@@ ds to vol@@ t@@ age ."
So he could see when a single neuro@@ n fi@@ res .
You &apos;re essen@@ ti@@ ally looking at a port@@ al into con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness that was desig@@ ned by mar@@ ine cre@@ at@@ ures .
So this br@@ ings me all back to perspe@@ ctive and relation@@ ship .
"F@@ ro@@ m de@@ ep space , our universe looks like a human brain cell , and then here we are in the de@@ ep ocean , and we &apos;re fin@@ ding mar@@ ine cre@@ at@@ ures and cells that can il@@ lu@@ min@@ ate the human mind ."
"And it &apos;s my hope that with il@@ lu@@ min@@ ated min@@ ds , we could pon@@ der the over@@ ar@@ ching inter@@ conne@@ c@@ te@@ d@@ ness of all life , and fa@@ th@@ om how much more l@@ ies in stor@@ e if we keep our oce@@ ans health@@ y ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So , these are the D@@ ar@@ k A@@ ges ."
"And the D@@ ar@@ k A@@ ges are the time between when you put away the L@@ ego for the last time as a kid , and you deci@@ de as an ad@@ ul@@ t that it is o@@ kay to play with a kid &apos;s to@@ y ."
"S@@ tar@@ ted out with my then f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old : &quot; &quot; Oh , should bu@@ y the kid some L@@ ego ."
That stuff &apos;s cool . &quot; &quot; W@@ al@@ ked into the L@@ ego stor@@ e .
B@@ ou@@ ght him this .
It &apos;s tot@@ ally appro@@ pri@@ ate for a f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old .
( Laughter ) I think the box says — let &apos;s see here — &quot; &quot; 8 to 12 &quot; &quot; on it .
"I turn to my wi@@ fe and said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are we bu@@ ying this for ? &quot; &quot; She &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Oh , us . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay . All right . That &apos;s cool . &quot; &quot; P@@ re@@ t@@ ty so@@ on it got a little bit out of control ."
The din@@ ing room looked like this .
"You walk there , and it h@@ ur@@ ts ."
So we took a room dow@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s in the bas@@ ement that had been used as sort of an A@@ b@@ u G@@ h@@ ra@@ i@@ b an@@ ne@@ x .
"( Laughter ) T@@ or@@ ture , very fun@@ ny ."
"W@@ ow , you guys are great ."
"And we put down those little flo@@ or ti@@ les , and then I went on@@ to e@@ B@@ ay and b@@ ou@@ ght 1@@ 50 po@@ un@@ ds of L@@ ego — ( Laughter ) which is in@@ s@@ ane ."
"My d@@ aughter — the day we got it , I was tu@@ c@@ king her in — and I said , &quot; H@@ on@@ ey , you &apos;re my tre@@ as@@ ure . &quot;"
"And she said , &quot; &quot; No , the L@@ ego is the tre@@ as@@ ure . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then she said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad , we &apos;re L@@ ego ri@@ ch . &quot; &quot; I was like , &quot; &quot; Yeah ."
"I sup@@ pos@@ e we are . &quot; &quot; So then once you do that you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Oh , c@@ ra@@ p . W@@ here am I going to put all this ? &quot; &quot; So you go to The Con@@ tain@@ er St@@ ore and spend an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of money , and then you start this c@@ razy sor@@ ting process that never — it &apos;s just nu@@ ts ."
Wh@@ atever .
So then you realize there are these con@@ ven@@ tions .
"And you go to one of these con@@ ven@@ tions , and some du@@ de built the T@@ it@@ ani@@ c ."
"And you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; H@@ o@@ ly sh@@ it !"
"He had to come in like a tru@@ ck , a se@@ mi , with this thing . &quot; &quot; And then someone built this — this is the S@@ mi@@ th T@@ ow@@ er in Se@@ at@@ tle ."
J@@ ust beautiful .
"And there &apos;s a du@@ de sel@@ ling these af@@ ter@@ market we@@ apo@@ ns for L@@ ego , because L@@ ego — the D@@ ani@@ sh — no , they &apos;re not into g@@ un@@ s ."
"But the Ameri@@ cans ? Oh , we &apos;ll make some g@@ un@@ s for L@@ ego , no problem ."
"And at a certain point , you look around , you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a , this is a really ner@@ dy c@@ row@@ d . &quot; &quot; And I mean like this is a ner@@ dy c@@ row@@ d , but that &apos;s like a couple of le@@ v@@ els ab@@ o@@ ve f@@ ur@@ r@@ ies ."
"( Laughter ) The ner@@ ds here , they get la@@ id — ex@@ cept for the l@@ ady with the con@@ dom@@ s in her po@@ ck@@ et — and you say to yourself at some point , &quot; A@@ m I part of this group ? Li@@ ke , am I into this ? &quot;"
"And I was just like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , I gu@@ ess I am ."
I &apos;m coming out .
"I &apos;m kind of into this stuff , and I &apos;m going to stop being em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sed . &quot; &quot; So then you really get into it , and you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Well , the L@@ ego people in D@@ en@@ mar@@ k , they &apos;ve got all this so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to let you build your own vi@@ r@@ tually . &quot; &quot; And so this is like this C@@ A@@ D program where you build it ."
"And then whatever you design vi@@ r@@ tually , you cli@@ ck the bu@@ t@@ ton and it shows up at your do@@ or@@ ste@@ p a week later ."
And then some of the desig@@ ns that people do they actually se@@ ll in the stor@@ e .
"The L@@ ego guys don &apos;t give you any ro@@ y@@ al@@ ties , str@@ ang@@ ely , but some us@@ er made this and then it s@@ old ."
And it &apos;s pretty amazing actually .
"Th@@ en you noti@@ ce that if that Le@@ go@@ -@@ provi@@ ded C@@ A@@ D program isn &apos;t enough , there &apos;s an entire open@@ -@@ source , th@@ ir@@ d-@@ par@@ ty , in@@ depen@@ dent L@@ ego C@@ A@@ D program that le@@ ts you do 3@@ D mode@@ ling and 3@@ D ren@@ der@@ ing and make , in fact , mov@@ ies out of L@@ ego , 3@@ D fil@@ ms of which there are thousands on Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be , and some of them sort of mi@@ mi@@ c@@ king fam@@ ous fil@@ ms and some tot@@ ally ori@@ gin@@ al cont@@ ent — just beautiful — and people re@@ cre@@ ating all sor@@ ts of things ."
I have to take a moment .
"I love the guy who &apos;s like ru@@ n@@ ning away with his clas@@ ps , his ho@@ o@@ ks ."
O@@ kay . An@@ y@@ way .
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s a whole progra@@ m@@ ming language and rob@@ oti@@ cs to@@ ol , so if you want to te@@ ach someone how to program , kid , ad@@ ul@@ t , whatever it is ."
"And the guy that made this , he made a s@@ lot mach@@ ine out of L@@ ego ."
And I don &apos;t mean he made L@@ ego that looked like a s@@ lot mach@@ ine ; I mean he made a s@@ lot mach@@ ine out of L@@ ego .
The in@@ si@@ des were L@@ ego .
"There &apos;s people getting dru@@ n@@ k building L@@ ego , and you &apos;ve got to fin@@ is@@ h the thing before you pu@@ ke ."

"And then , just some exam@@ ples . This stuff really is s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ."
This is amazing what you can do .
"And don &apos;t kid yourself : some archite@@ ctu@@ ral de@@ ta@@ il@@ s , incredible organi@@ c sha@@ p@@ es and just , even , nature out of , again , little blo@@ cks ."
This is my house .

I am a g@@ ay talking head on F@@ o@@ x N@@ ew@@ s .
I am going to tell you how I do it and the most important thing I &apos;ve learned .
So I go on tele@@ vision .
"It &apos;s sort of like Th@@ an@@ k@@ s@@ gi@@ ving with your con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative un@@ cle on ster@@ o@@ i@@ ds , with a live tele@@ vision audience of mi@@ llions ."

"E@@ moti@@ onal cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ness is the t@@ one , the feeling , how we say what we say , the re@@ spe@@ ct and comp@@ as@@ sion we show one another ."
And what I &apos;ve realized is that poli@@ tical per@@ su@@ a@@ sion doesn &apos;t beg@@ in with ideas or fac@@ ts or data .
Po@@ li@@ tical per@@ su@@ a@@ sion begin@@ s with being emoti@@ on@@ ally cor@@ re@@ ct .
"That , by the way , in case you &apos;re pa@@ ying at@@ ten@@ tion , is not emoti@@ on@@ ally cor@@ re@@ ct ."
"But li@@ ber@@ als on my side , we can be self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , we can be con@@ des@@ cen@@ ding , we can be dis@@ mis@@ sive of any@@ one who doesn &apos;t ag@@ ree with us ."
"In other words , we can be poli@@ ti@@ cally right but emoti@@ on@@ ally wrong ."
"And in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , that means that people don &apos;t like us . R@@ ight ?"
Now here &apos;s the ki@@ ck@@ er .
Con@@ ser@@ v@@ ati@@ ves are really nice .
"I mean , not all of them , and not the ones who sen@@ d me h@@ ate ma@@ il , but you would be sur@@ pri@@ sed ."
Se@@ an H@@ an@@ ni@@ ty is one of the s@@ wee@@ test guys I &apos;ve ever met .
"He sp@@ en@@ ds his f@@ ree time trying to fi@@ x up his st@@ af@@ f on bl@@ ind d@@ ates , and I know that if I ever had a problem , he would do anything he could to help ."
"Now , I think Se@@ an H@@ an@@ ni@@ ty is 9@@ 9 percent poli@@ ti@@ cally wrong , but his emoti@@ onal cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ness is stri@@ k@@ ing@@ ly im@@ pres@@ sive , and that &apos;s why people list@@ en to him ."
Because you can &apos;t get any@@ one to ag@@ ree with you if they don &apos;t even list@@ en to you first .
"We spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our dis@@ ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , and if we can start to find comp@@ as@@ sion for one another , then we have a sh@@ ot at building common ground ."
"It actually sounds really ho@@ key to say it standing up here , but when you try to put it in prac@@ ti@@ ce , it &apos;s really powerful ."
"So someone who says they h@@ ate im@@ mi@@ gran@@ ts , I try to imagine how sc@@ ared they must be that their community is chang@@ ing from what they &apos;ve always known ."
"O@@ r someone who says they don &apos;t like teach@@ ers &apos; uni@@ ons , I be@@ t they &apos;re really de@@ v@@ ast@@ ated to see their kid &apos;s school going into the gu@@ t@@ ter , and they &apos;re just looking for someone to bl@@ ame ."
O@@ ur challen@@ ge is to find the comp@@ as@@ sion for others that we want them to have for us .
That is emoti@@ onal cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ness .
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s e@@ asy .
"This whole fin@@ ding comp@@ as@@ sion and common ground with your ene@@ mie@@ s thing is kind of like a poli@@ ti@@ cal@@ -@@ spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al prac@@ ti@@ ce for me , and I a@@ in &apos;t the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ ama ."
"I &apos;m not perfe@@ ct , but what I am is op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic , because I don &apos;t just get h@@ ate ma@@ il ."
"I get a lot of really nice let@@ ters , lots of them ."
"And one of my al@@ l-@@ time fa@@ v@@ ori@@ tes begin@@ s , &quot; &quot; I am not a big f@@ an of your poli@@ tical le@@ an@@ ings or your sometimes tor@@ tu@@ red logi@@ c , but I &apos;m a big f@@ an of you as a person . &quot; &quot; Now this guy doesn &apos;t ag@@ ree with me , yet ."
"( Laughter ) But he &apos;s list@@ ening , not because of what I said , but because of how I said it , and some@@ how , even though we &apos;ve never met , we &apos;ve man@@ aged to form a conne@@ ction ."
"That &apos;s emoti@@ onal cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ness , and that &apos;s how we start the convers@@ ations that really le@@ ad to change ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m a belie@@ ver .
"I &apos;m a belie@@ ver in global war@@ ming , and my recor@@ d is good on the sub@@ je@@ ct ."
But my sub@@ je@@ ct is national secu@@ ri@@ ty .
We have to get off of oil pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ed from the ene@@ my .
I &apos;m talking about O@@ P@@ E@@ C oil .
And let me take you back 100 years to 19@@ 12 .
You &apos;re probably thinking that was my bir@@ th year .
( Laughter ) It wasn &apos;t . It was 19@@ 2@@ 8 .
"But go back to 19@@ 12 , 100 years ago , and look at that point what we , our country , was fac@@ ed with ."
"It &apos;s the same energy question that you &apos;re looking at today , but it &apos;s different sources of fu@@ el ."
"A hundre@@ d years ago we were looking at co@@ al , of course , and we were looking at wh@@ ale oil and we were looking at c@@ ru@@ de oil ."
"A@@ t that point , we were looking for a fu@@ el that was cle@@ an@@ er , it was che@@ ap@@ er , and it wasn &apos;t ours though , it was the@@ ir@@ s ."
"So at that point , 19@@ 12 , we se@@ le@@ cted c@@ ru@@ de oil over wh@@ ale oil and some more co@@ al ."
"But as we mo@@ ved on to the per@@ i@@ od now , 100 years later , we &apos;re back really at another deci@@ sion point ."
What is the deci@@ sion point ?
It &apos;s what we &apos;re going to use in the future .
"So from here , it &apos;s pretty clear to me , we would pre@@ f@@ er to have cle@@ an@@ er , che@@ ap@@ er , dom@@ esti@@ c , ours — and we have that , we have that — which is natural gas ."
"So here you are , that the cost of all this to the world is 8@@ 9 million bar@@ re@@ ls of oil , give or take a few bar@@ re@@ ls , every day ."
And the cost an@@ nu@@ ally is three tri@@ llion dollars .
And one tri@@ llion of that goes to O@@ P@@ E@@ C .
That has got to be stop@@ ped .
"Now if you look at the cost of O@@ P@@ E@@ C , it cost seven tri@@ llion dollars — on the M@@ il@@ k@@ en In@@ stitu@@ te study last year — seven tri@@ llion dollars since 19@@ 7@@ 6 , is what we pa@@ id for oil from O@@ P@@ E@@ C ."
Now that inclu@@ des the cost of mi@@ lit@@ ary and the cost of the fu@@ el both .
"But it &apos;s the gre@@ at@@ est trans@@ f@@ er of we@@ alth , from one group to another in the history of man@@ kind ."
And it contin@@ u@@ es .
"Now when you look at where is the trans@@ f@@ er of we@@ alth , you can see here that we have the ar@@ row@@ s going into the Mi@@ d-@@ E@@ ast and away from us ."
"And with that , we have found ourselves to be the world &apos;s poli@@ c@@ em@@ en ."
"We are poli@@ cing the world , and how are we doing that ?"
I know the respon@@ se to this .
I would be@@ t there ar@@ en &apos;t 10 percent of you in the room that know how many air@@ c@@ ra@@ ft car@@ r@@ ier@@ s there are in the world .
R@@ a@@ ise your hand if you think you know .
There are 12 .
One is under con@@ stru@@ ction by the Chin@@ ese and the other 11 be@@ long to us .
Why do we have 11 air@@ c@@ ra@@ ft car@@ r@@ ier@@ s ?
Do we have a cor@@ ner on the market ?
A@@ re we s@@ mar@@ ter than any@@ body else ? I &apos;m not sure .
"If you look at where they &apos;re lo@@ c@@ ated — and on this sli@@ de it &apos;s the red blo@@ b@@ s on there — there are five that are oper@@ ating in the Mi@@ d-@@ E@@ ast , and the rest of them are in the United States ."
They just move back to the Mi@@ d-@@ E@@ ast and those come back .
So actually most of the 11 we have are t@@ ied up in the Mi@@ d-@@ E@@ ast .
Why ? Why are they in the Mi@@ d-@@ E@@ ast ?
"They &apos;re there to control , keep the shi@@ pping lan@@ es open and make oil available ."
"And the United States uses about 20 million bar@@ re@@ ls a day , which is about 25 percent of all the oil used every@@ day in the world ."
And we &apos;re doing it with four percent of the popul@@ ation .
S@@ ome@@ how that doesn &apos;t se@@ em right .
That &apos;s not susta@@ in@@ able .
So where do we go from here ?
D@@ o@@ es that contin@@ ue ?
"@@ Yes , it &apos;s going to contin@@ ue ."
The sli@@ de you &apos;re looking at here is 199@@ 0 to 20@@ 40 .
O@@ ver that per@@ i@@ od you are going to d@@ ou@@ ble your de@@ m@@ and .
"And when you look at what we &apos;re using the oil for , 70 percent of it is used for transpor@@ tation fu@@ el ."
"So when somebody says , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go more nuclear , let &apos;s go wind , let &apos;s go solar , &quot; &quot; f@@ ine ; I &apos;m for anything American , anything American ."
"But if you &apos;re going to do anything about the depen@@ den@@ cy on fore@@ ig@@ n oil , you have to ad@@ dre@@ ss transpor@@ tation ."
"So here we are using 20 million bar@@ re@@ ls a day — produ@@ cing eight , im@@ por@@ ting 12 , and from the 12 , five comes from O@@ P@@ E@@ C ."
"When you look at the bi@@ ggest us@@ er and the second largest us@@ er , we use 20 million bar@@ re@@ ls and the Chin@@ ese use 10 ."
The Chin@@ ese have a little bit better pl@@ an — or they have a pl@@ an ; we have no pl@@ an .
"In the history of America , we &apos;ve never had an energy pl@@ an ."
We don &apos;t even realize the re@@ sources that we have available to us .
"If you take the last 10 years and bring forward , you &apos;ve trans@@ fer@@ red to O@@ P@@ E@@ C a tri@@ llion dollars ."
"If you go forward the next 10 years and ca@@ p the pri@@ ce of oil at 100 dollars a bar@@ re@@ l , you will pay 2@@ .@@ 2 tri@@ llion ."
That &apos;s not susta@@ in@@ able either .
But the days of che@@ a@@ p oil are over .
They &apos;re over .
"They make it very clear to you , the S@@ aud@@ is do , they have to have 9@@ 4 dollars a bar@@ re@@ l to make their social com@@ mi@@ t@@ ments ."
"Now I had people in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton last week told me , he said , &quot; &quot; The S@@ aud@@ is can produ@@ ce the oil for five dollars a bar@@ re@@ l ."
That has nothing to do with it .
It &apos;s what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil . &quot; &quot; There is no f@@ ree market for oil .
The oil is pri@@ ced off the mar@@ g@@ in .
And the O@@ P@@ E@@ C n@@ ations are the ones that pri@@ ce the oil .
So where are we he@@ ad@@ ed from here ?
We &apos;re he@@ ad@@ ed to natural gas .
N@@ at@@ u@@ ral gas will do everything we want it to do .
It &apos;s 1@@ 30 o@@ ct@@ ane fu@@ el .
It &apos;s 25 percent cle@@ an@@ er than oil .
"It &apos;s ours , we have an ab@@ un@@ dance of it ."
And it does not requi@@ re a re@@ fin@@ ery .
It comes out of the ground at 1@@ 30 o@@ ct@@ ane .
R@@ u@@ n it through the se@@ par@@ ator and you &apos;re ready to use it .
It &apos;s going to be very simple for us to use .
It &apos;s going to be simple to ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh this .
"You &apos;re going to find , and I &apos;ll tell you in just a minu@@ te , what you &apos;re looking for to make it happen ."
But here you can look at the li@@ st .
N@@ at@@ u@@ ral gas will f@@ it all of those .
It will re@@ place or be able to be used for that .
"It &apos;s for power gener@@ ation , transpor@@ tation , it &apos;s pe@@ aking fu@@ el , it &apos;s all those ."
Do we have enough natural gas ?
L@@ ook at the b@@ ar on the left . It &apos;s 2@@ 4 tri@@ llion .
It &apos;s what we use a year .
"G@@ o forward and the est@@ im@@ ates that you have from the E@@ I@@ A and on@@ to the indu@@ stry est@@ im@@ ates — the indu@@ stry know@@ s what they &apos;re talking about — we &apos;ve got 4@@ ,000 tri@@ llion cu@@ bi@@ c fe@@ et of natural gas that &apos;s available to us ."
How does that trans@@ l@@ ate to bar@@ re@@ ls of oil e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent ?
It would be three times what the S@@ aud@@ is c@@ la@@ im they have .
"And they c@@ la@@ im they have 2@@ 50 billion bar@@ re@@ ls of oil , which I do not believe ."
I think it &apos;s probably 1@@ 7@@ 5 billion bar@@ re@@ ls .
"But any@@ way , whether they say they &apos;re right or whatever , we have pl@@ en@@ ty of natural gas ."
So I have tr@@ ied to tar@@ get on where we use the natural gas .
And where I &apos;ve tar@@ ge@@ ted is on the he@@ av@@ y@@ -@@ du@@ ty tru@@ cks .
There are eight million of them .
"You take eight million tru@@ cks — these are 1@@ 8@@ -@@ whe@@ el@@ ers — and take them to natural gas , redu@@ ce car@@ b@@ on by 30 percent , it is che@@ ap@@ er and it will cut our im@@ por@@ ts three million bar@@ re@@ ls ."
So you will cut 60 percent off of O@@ P@@ E@@ C with eight million tru@@ cks .
There are 2@@ 50 million ve@@ hi@@ cles in America .
"So what you have is natural gas is the bri@@ dge fu@@ el , is the way I see it ."
I don &apos;t have to wor@@ ry about the bri@@ dge to where at my age .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s your con@@ cer@@ n .
"But when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bri@@ dge to natural gas , because you have pl@@ en@@ ty of natural gas ."
"But as I said , I &apos;m for anything American ."
Now let me take you — I &apos;ve been a reali@@ st — I went from the@@ ori@@ st early to reali@@ st .
I &apos;m back to the@@ ori@@ st again .
"If you look at the world , you have meth@@ ane hy@@ d@@ r@@ ates in the ocean around every contin@@ ent ."
"And here you can see meth@@ ane , if that &apos;s the way you &apos;re going to go , that there &apos;s pl@@ en@@ ty of meth@@ ane — natural gas is meth@@ ane , meth@@ ane and natural gas are inter@@ chang@@ e@@ able — but if you deci@@ de that you &apos;re going to use some meth@@ ane — and I &apos;m gone , so it &apos;s up to you — but we do have pl@@ en@@ ty of meth@@ ane hy@@ d@@ r@@ ates ."
So I think I &apos;ve made my point that we have to get on our own re@@ sources in America .
If we do — it &apos;s co@@ st@@ ing us a billion dollars a day for oil .
"And yet , we have no energy pl@@ an ."
"So there &apos;s nothing going on that im@@ pres@@ ses me in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton on that pl@@ an , other than I &apos;m trying to fo@@ cus on that eight million 1@@ 8@@ -@@ whe@@ el@@ ers ."
"If we could do that , I think we would take our first ste@@ p to an energy pl@@ an ."
"If we did , we could see that our own re@@ sources are e@@ as@@ ier to use than any@@ body can imagine ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Th@@ an@@ ks for that .
"So from your point of view , you had this great P@@ i@@ ck@@ ens P@@ l@@ an that was based on wind energy , and you ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed it basically because the econ@@ omi@@ cs changed ."
What happened ?
T@@ B@@ P : I lost 1@@ 50 million dollars .
( Laughter ) That &apos;ll make you ab@@ an@@ don something .
"No , what happened to us , Ch@@ ris , is that power , it &apos;s pri@@ ced off the mar@@ g@@ in ."
And so the mar@@ g@@ in is natural gas .
"And at the time I went into the wind business , natural gas was n@@ ine dollars ."
T@@ od@@ ay it &apos;s two dollars and for@@ ty c@@ ents .
You cannot do a wind deal under six dollars an M@@ C@@ F .
"CA : So what happened was that , through incre@@ as@@ ed ability to use f@@ rac@@ king technology , the cal@@ cu@@ lated re@@ ser@@ ves of natural gas kind of ex@@ plo@@ ded and the pri@@ ce p@@ lu@@ m@@ me@@ ted , which made wind un@@ compe@@ ti@@ tive ."
In a n@@ ut@@ sh@@ ell that &apos;s what happened ?
T@@ B@@ P : That &apos;s what happened .
"We found out that we could go to the source ro@@ ck , which were the car@@ b@@ oni@@ fer@@ ous sh@@ al@@ es in the bas@@ ins ."
"The first one was Bar@@ net@@ t S@@ h@@ ale in T@@ ex@@ as and then the Mar@@ cel@@ lu@@ s up in the Nor@@ the@@ ast across New York , P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia ; and Ha@@ y@@ n@@ es@@ vi@@ l@@ le in L@@ ou@@ i@@ si@@ ana ."
This stuff is every@@ where .
We are over@@ wh@@ el@@ med with natural gas .
CA : And now you &apos;re a big inv@@ est@@ or in that and br@@ ing@@ ing that to market ?
T@@ B@@ P : Well you say a big inv@@ est@@ or .
It &apos;s my life .
"I &apos;m a ge@@ ologi@@ st , got out of school in &apos; 5@@ 1 , and I &apos;ve been in the indu@@ stry my entire life ."
Now I do own sto@@ cks .
I &apos;m not a big natural gas produ@@ cer .
S@@ ome@@ body the other day said I was the second largest natural gas produ@@ cer in the United States .
D@@ on &apos;t I wi@@ sh .
"But no , I &apos;m not . I own sto@@ cks ."
But I also am in the fu@@ el@@ ing business .
CA : But natural gas is a f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ el .
"You bur@@ n it , you rele@@ ase C@@ O@@ 2 ."
So you believe in the thre@@ at of clim@@ ate change .
Why doesn &apos;t that pro@@ spe@@ ct con@@ cer@@ n you ?
T@@ B@@ P : Well you &apos;re going to have to use something .
What do you have to re@@ place it ?
"( Laughter ) CA : No , no . The ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent that it &apos;s a bri@@ dge fu@@ el makes sense , because the amount of C@@ O@@ 2 per uni@@ t of energy is low@@ er than oil and co@@ al , cor@@ re@@ ct ?"
And so everyone can be at least happy to see a shi@@ ft from co@@ al or oil to natural gas .
"But if that &apos;s it and that be@@ comes the reason that r@@ ene@@ wa@@ b@@ les don &apos;t get inv@@ est@@ ed in , then , lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m , we &apos;re scre@@ w@@ ed any@@ way , right ?"
"T@@ B@@ P : Well I &apos;m not ready to give up , but J@@ im and I tal@@ ked there as he left , and I said , &quot; &quot; How do you feel about natural gas ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well it &apos;s a bri@@ dge fu@@ el , is what it is . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Bri@@ dge to what ?"
"W@@ here are we he@@ ad@@ ed ? &quot; &quot; Se@@ e but again , I told you , I don &apos;t have to wor@@ ry with that ."
You all do .
"CA : But I don &apos;t think that &apos;s right , Bo@@ one ."
I think you &apos;re a person who belie@@ ves in your leg@@ acy .
You &apos;ve made the money you need .
You &apos;re one of the few people in a posi@@ tion to really s@@ w@@ ing the de@@ b@@ ate .
Do you sup@@ port the idea of some kind of pri@@ ce on car@@ b@@ on ?
D@@ o@@ es that make sense ?
T@@ B@@ P : I don &apos;t like that because it en@@ ds up the government is going to run the program .
I can tell you it will be a fai@@ lu@@ re .
The government is not suc@@ cess@@ ful on these things .
"They just ar@@ en &apos;t , it &apos;s a bad deal ."
"L@@ ook at S@@ ol@@ y@@ n@@ d@@ ra , or whatever it was ."
"I mean , that was told to be a bad idea 10 times , they went a@@ head and did it any@@ way ."
But that only b@@ le@@ w out 500 million .
I think it &apos;s clo@@ s@@ er to a billion .
"But Ch@@ ris , I think where we &apos;re he@@ ad@@ ed , the lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m , I don &apos;t mind going back to nuclear ."
And I can tell you what the last p@@ age of the re@@ port that will take them five years to write will be .
"One , don &apos;t build a re@@ form@@ er on a f@@ au@@ l@@ t ."
"( Laughter ) And number two , do not build a re@@ form@@ er on the ocean ."
And now I think re@@ form@@ ers are sa@@ fe .
Mo@@ ve them in@@ land and on very st@@ able ground and build the re@@ form@@ ers .
There isn &apos;t anything wrong with nu@@ ke .
You &apos;re going to have to have energy . There is no question .
You can &apos;t — o@@ kay .
"CA : One of the questions from the audience is , with f@@ rac@@ king and the natural gas process , what about the problem of meth@@ ane le@@ aking from that , meth@@ ane being a wor@@ se global war@@ ming gas than C@@ O@@ 2 ?"
Is that a con@@ cer@@ n ?
T@@ B@@ P : F@@ rac@@ king ? What is f@@ rac@@ king ?

"( Laughter ) CA : We &apos;ve got a little bit of ac@@ cent in@@ comp@@ ati@@ bility here , you know ."
"T@@ B@@ P : No , let me tell you , I &apos;ve told you what my age was ."
I got out of school in &apos; 5@@ 1 .
I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed my first f@@ rac@@ k job at bor@@ der T@@ ex@@ as in 19@@ 5@@ 3 .
"F@@ rac@@ king came out in &apos; 4@@ 7 , and don &apos;t believe for a minu@@ te when our pre@@ si@@ dent gets up there and says the De@@ part@@ ment of E@@ ner@@ gy 30 years ago develo@@ ped f@@ rac@@ king ."
I don &apos;t know what in the he@@ ll he &apos;s talking about .
"I mean seri@@ ously , the De@@ part@@ ment of E@@ ner@@ gy did not have anything to do with f@@ rac@@ king ."
The first f@@ rac@@ k job was in &apos; 4@@ 7 .
I saw my first one in &apos; 5@@ 3 .
"I &apos;ve f@@ rac@@ ked over 3@@ ,000 wel@@ ls in my life ."
N@@ ever had a problem with mess@@ ing up an a@@ qui@@ f@@ er or anything else .
"Now the largest a@@ qui@@ f@@ er in Nor@@ th America is from Mi@@ d@@ land , T@@ ex@@ as to the S@@ outh D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a bor@@ der , across eight st@@ ates — big a@@ qui@@ f@@ er : O@@ gal@@ l@@ ala , T@@ ri@@ as@@ si@@ c age ."
"There had to have been 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 wel@@ ls f@@ rac@@ ked in O@@ k@@ la@@ hom@@ a , T@@ ex@@ as , K@@ ans@@ as in that a@@ qui@@ f@@ er ."
There &apos;s no problems .

"T@@ B@@ P : S@@ ol@@ ar and wind , J@@ im and I ag@@ re@@ ed on that in 1@@ 3 secon@@ ds ."
"That is , it &apos;s going to be a small part , because you can &apos;t re@@ ly on it ."

T@@ B@@ P : How do we get there ?
"We have so much natural gas , a day will not come where you say , &quot; &quot; Well let &apos;s don &apos;t use that any@@ more . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll keep using it . It is the cle@@ an@@ est of all ."
"And if you look at C@@ alifor@@ nia , they use 2@@ ,@@ 500 bus@@ es ."
L@@ A@@ M@@ T@@ A have been on natural gas for 25 years .
The F@@ t . Wor@@ th T has been on it for 25 years .
Why ? A@@ ir qu@@ ality was the reason they used natural gas and got away from d@@ ie@@ se@@ l .
Why are all the tra@@ sh tru@@ cks today in S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n C@@ alifor@@ nia on natural gas ?
It &apos;s because of air qu@@ ality .
"I know what you &apos;re tel@@ ling me , and I &apos;m not dis@@ ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing with you ."
How in the he@@ ll can we get off the natural gas at some point ?
"And I say , that is your problem ."
"( Laughter ) CA : All right , so it &apos;s the bri@@ dge fu@@ el ."
What is at the other end of that bri@@ dge is for this audience to figure out .

"A Chin@@ ese sch@@ ol@@ ar would understand 20@@ ,000 char@@ ac@@ ters ."
"You only need 1@@ ,000 to understand the basi@@ c liter@@ acy ."
"The top 2@@ 00 will al@@ low you to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end 40 percent of basi@@ c liter@@ ature — enough to read ro@@ ad sig@@ ns , re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant men@@ us , to understand the basi@@ c idea of the we@@ b p@@ ages or the ne@@ wsp@@ a@@ per@@ s ."
T@@ od@@ ay I &apos;m going to start with eight to show you how the meth@@ od works .
You are ready ?
O@@ p@@ en your m@@ outh as wi@@ de as possible until it &apos;s squ@@ are .
You get a m@@ outh .
This is a person going for a walk .
P@@ er@@ son .
"If the sha@@ pe of the fi@@ re is a person with two ar@@ ms on both si@@ des , as if she was y@@ el@@ ling f@@ ran@@ ti@@ cally , &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ p ! I &apos;m on fi@@ re ! &quot; &quot; — This sym@@ bo@@ l actually is ori@@ gin@@ ally from the sha@@ pe of the fl@@ ame , but I like to think that way . W@@ hi@@ ch@@ ever works for you ."
This is a t@@ ree .
T@@ ree .
This is a m@@ oun@@ tain .
The su@@ n .
The mo@@ on .
The sym@@ bo@@ l of the door looks like a pa@@ ir of s@@ al@@ o@@ on do@@ ors in the wi@@ ld w@@ est .
I call these eight char@@ ac@@ ters radi@@ cal@@ s .
They are the building blo@@ cks for you to create lots more char@@ ac@@ ters .
A person .
"If someone wal@@ ks behind , that is &quot; &quot; to fol@@ low . &quot; &quot; A@@ s the old saying goes , two is company , three is a c@@ row@@ d ."
"If a person stre@@ t@@ ched their ar@@ ms wi@@ de , this person is saying , &quot; &quot; It was this big . &quot; &quot; The person inside the m@@ outh , the person is tra@@ pped ."
"He &apos;s a pri@@ son@@ er , just like J@@ on@@ ah inside the wh@@ ale ."
"One t@@ ree is a t@@ ree . T@@ wo tre@@ es together , we have the wo@@ ods ."
"Th@@ ree tre@@ es together , we create the fore@@ st ."
"P@@ u@@ t a plan@@ k under@@ ne@@ ath the t@@ ree , we have the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
"P@@ u@@ t a m@@ outh on the top of the t@@ ree , that &apos;s &quot; &quot; i@@ di@@ ot . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ asy to remember , since a talking t@@ ree is pretty i@@ di@@ oti@@ c ."
Re@@ member fi@@ re ?
"T@@ wo fi@@ res together , I get really ho@@ t ."
"Th@@ ree fi@@ res together , that &apos;s a lot of fl@@ am@@ es ."
"S@@ et the fi@@ re under@@ ne@@ ath the two tre@@ es , it &apos;s bur@@ ning ."
"For us , the su@@ n is the source of pro@@ sp@@ eri@@ ty ."
"T@@ wo su@@ ns together , pro@@ sp@@ er@@ ous ."
"Th@@ ree together , that &apos;s sp@@ ar@@ k@@ les ."
"P@@ u@@ t the su@@ n and the mo@@ on sh@@ ining together , it &apos;s bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
"It also means tom@@ or@@ row , after a day and a night ."
The su@@ n is coming up ab@@ o@@ ve the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on . S@@ un@@ ri@@ se .
"A door . P@@ u@@ t a plan@@ k inside the door , it &apos;s a door b@@ ol@@ t ."
"P@@ u@@ t a m@@ outh inside the door , as@@ king questions ."
K@@ no@@ ck k@@ no@@ ck . Is any@@ one home ?
"This person is s@@ ne@@ aking out of a door , es@@ ca@@ ping , ev@@ ading ."
"O@@ n the left , we have a woman ."
"T@@ wo women together , they have an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent ."
"( Laughter ) Th@@ ree women together , be car@@ e@@ ful , it &apos;s ad@@ ul@@ tery ."
So we have gone through almost 30 char@@ ac@@ ters .
"B@@ y using this meth@@ od , the first eight radi@@ cal@@ s will al@@ low you to build 3@@ 2 ."
The next group of eight char@@ ac@@ ters will build an ex@@ tra 3@@ 2 .
"So with very little ef@@ for@@ t , you will be able to learn a couple hundre@@ d char@@ ac@@ ters , which is the same as a Chin@@ ese e@@ igh@@ t-@@ year@@ -@@ old ."
"So after we know the char@@ ac@@ ters , we start building ph@@ ra@@ ses ."
"For example , the m@@ oun@@ tain and the fi@@ re together , we have fi@@ re m@@ oun@@ tain . It &apos;s a vol@@ c@@ ano ."
We know J@@ ap@@ an is the land of the ri@@ sing su@@ n .
"This is a su@@ n plac@@ ed with the ori@@ g@@ in , because J@@ ap@@ an l@@ ies to the e@@ ast of China ."
"So a su@@ n , ori@@ g@@ in together , we build J@@ ap@@ an ."
"A person behind J@@ ap@@ an , what do we get ?"
A J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese person .
The char@@ ac@@ ter on the left is two m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins st@@ ac@@ ked on top of each other .
"In an@@ cient China , that means in ex@@ ile , because Chin@@ ese em@@ per@@ ors , they put their poli@@ tical ene@@ mie@@ s in ex@@ ile be@@ y@@ ond m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ."
"N@@ ow@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , ex@@ ile has turned into getting out ."
A m@@ outh which tel@@ ls you where to get out is an ex@@ it .
This is a sli@@ de to re@@ mind me that I should stop talking and get off of the st@@ age . Thank you .
( Applause )
"In 200@@ 9 , I lost someone I lo@@ ved very much ."
And her death was sud@@ den and u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted .

"The wri@@ ter G@@ e@@ or@@ ge E@@ li@@ ot ca@@ u@@ tion@@ ed us that , am@@ ong all form@@ s of mist@@ ake , pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y is the most gr@@ at@@ u@@ it@@ ous ."
"The person that we would all ac@@ know@@ le@@ dge as her 20@@ th@@ -@@ century coun@@ ter@@ part , Y@@ og@@ i B@@ er@@ ra , ag@@ re@@ ed ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s t@@ ough to make pre@@ di@@ ctions , es@@ pe@@ cially about the future . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to ig@@ nor@@ e their ca@@ u@@ tions and make one very speci@@ fic fore@@ c@@ ast ."
"In the world that we are cre@@ ating very quickly , we &apos;re going to see more and more things that look like science fi@@ ction , and fe@@ wer and fe@@ wer things that look like j@@ ob@@ s ."
"O@@ ur cars are very quickly going to start dri@@ ving themselves , which means we &apos;re going to need fe@@ wer tru@@ ck dri@@ ver@@ s ."
"We &apos;re going to ho@@ ok S@@ ir@@ i up to W@@ at@@ son and use that to au@@ tom@@ ate a lot of the work that &apos;s cur@@ r@@ ently done by cu@@ st@@ om@@ er ser@@ vice re@@ ps and t@@ rou@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ ot@@ ers and di@@ ag@@ no@@ s@@ ers , and we &apos;re already taking R@@ 2@@ D@@ 2 , pain@@ ting him or@@ ange , and pu@@ tting him to work car@@ ry@@ ing sh@@ el@@ ves around war@@ e@@ h@@ ous@@ es , which means we need a lot fe@@ wer people to be wal@@ king up and down those a@@ is@@ les ."
"Now , for about 2@@ 00 years , people have been saying exactly what I &apos;m tel@@ ling you — the age of technologi@@ cal u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment is at hand — star@@ ting with the L@@ ud@@ di@@ tes s@@ mas@@ h@@ ing lo@@ oms in Bri@@ tain just about two cen@@ tur@@ ies ago , and they have been wrong ."
O@@ ur econom@@ ies in the develo@@ ped world have co@@ ast@@ ed along on something pretty close to full em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment .
"Wh@@ ich br@@ ings up a cri@@ tical question : Why is this time different , if it really is ?"
"The reason it &apos;s different is that , just in the past few years , our mach@@ ines have started de@@ mon@@ str@@ ating sk@@ il@@ ls they have never , ever had before : under@@ standing , spe@@ aking , hear@@ ing , seeing , ans@@ wer@@ ing , writing , and they &apos;re still ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing new sk@@ il@@ ls ."
"For example , mo@@ bi@@ le hum@@ an@@ o@@ id rob@@ ots are still incredi@@ bly pri@@ mi@@ tive , but the research ar@@ m of the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se De@@ part@@ ment just la@@ un@@ ched a compe@@ ti@@ tion to have them do things like this , and if the tr@@ ack recor@@ d is any gu@@ i@@ de , this compe@@ ti@@ tion is going to be suc@@ cess@@ ful ."
"So when I look around , I think the day is not too far off at all when we &apos;re going to have an@@ dro@@ i@@ ds doing a lot of the work that we are doing right now ."
And we &apos;re cre@@ ating a world where there is going to be more and more technology and fe@@ wer and fe@@ wer j@@ ob@@ s .
It &apos;s a world that E@@ ri@@ k B@@ ry@@ n@@ j@@ ol@@ f@@ s@@ son and I are cal@@ ling &quot; the new mach@@ ine age . &quot;
The thing to keep in mind is that this is absolu@@ tely great news .
This is the best economic news on the planet these days .
"N@@ ot that there &apos;s a lot of compe@@ ti@@ tion , right ?"
This is the best economic news we have these days for two ma@@ in reas@@ ons .
"The first is , technologi@@ cal pro@@ gre@@ ss is what allow@@ s us to contin@@ ue this amazing re@@ cent run that we &apos;re on where out@@ put goes up over time , while at the same time , pri@@ ces go down , and v@@ olu@@ me and qu@@ ality just contin@@ ue to ex@@ plo@@ de ."
"Now , some people look at this and talk about sh@@ al@@ low materi@@ ali@@ sm , but that &apos;s absolu@@ tely the wrong way to look at it ."
"This is ab@@ un@@ dance , which is exactly what we want our economic system to provi@@ de ."
"The second reason that the new mach@@ ine age is such great news is that , once the an@@ dro@@ i@@ ds start doing j@@ ob@@ s , we don &apos;t have to do them any@@ more , and we get fre@@ ed up from dru@@ d@@ g@@ ery and to@@ il ."
"Now , when I talk about this with my friends in C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge and S@@ i@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ ley , they say , &quot; &quot; F@@ an@@ ta@@ stic . No more dru@@ d@@ g@@ ery , no more to@@ il ."
"This gi@@ ves us the ch@@ ance to imagine an enti@@ re@@ ly different kind of society , a society where the cre@@ at@@ ors and the disco@@ ver@@ ers and the perform@@ ers and the in@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ ors come together with their pat@@ ron@@ s and their fin@@ an@@ cie@@ r@@ s to talk about issu@@ es , en@@ ter@@ tain , en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten , pro@@ vo@@ ke each other . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a society really , that looks a lot like the TED Con@@ fer@@ ence ."
And there &apos;s actually a huge amount of tru@@ th here .
We are seeing an amazing fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing taking place .
"In a world where it is just about as e@@ asy to gener@@ ate an obje@@ ct as it is to pr@@ int a do@@ cu@@ ment , we have amazing new possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies ."
"The people who used to be c@@ ra@@ f@@ t@@ s@@ men and h@@ ob@@ by@@ ist@@ s are now mak@@ ers , and they &apos;re respon@@ si@@ ble for mas@@ sive amoun@@ ts of in@@ no@@ vation ."
"And arti@@ sts who were form@@ er@@ ly con@@ stra@@ ined can now do things that were never , ever possible for them before ."
"So this is a time of great fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing , and the more I look around , the more con@@ v@@ in@@ ced I become that this quot@@ e , from the physi@@ ci@@ st F@@ re@@ em@@ an D@@ y@@ son , is not hy@@ per@@ bo@@ le at all ."
This is just a pla@@ in stat@@ ement of the fac@@ ts .
We are in the mi@@ ddle of an ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing per@@ i@@ od .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ ech@@ no@@ logy is a gi@@ ft of God . Af@@ ter the gi@@ ft of life it is per@@ haps the gre@@ at@@ est of God &apos;s gi@@ f@@ ts . It is the mother of ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations , of ar@@ ts and of scien@@ ces . &quot; &quot; — F@@ re@@ em@@ an D@@ y@@ son &#93; Wh@@ ich br@@ ings up another great question : What could possi@@ bly go wrong in this new mach@@ ine age ?"
"R@@ ight ? Gre@@ at , h@@ an@@ g up , fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh , go home ."
We &apos;re going to face two really th@@ or@@ ny se@@ ts of challen@@ ges as we head de@@ e@@ per into the future that we &apos;re cre@@ ating .
"The first are economic , and they &apos;re really ni@@ ce@@ ly sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed in an apo@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ha@@ l story about a back@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ for@@ th between H@@ en@@ ry F@@ or@@ d I@@ I and W@@ al@@ ter Re@@ u@@ ther , who was the head of the au@@ to wor@@ k@@ ers uni@@ on ."
"They were t@@ our@@ ing one of the new moder@@ n fac@@ tor@@ ies , and F@@ or@@ d pla@@ y@@ fully turns to Re@@ u@@ ther and says , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey W@@ al@@ ter , how are you going to get these rob@@ ots to pay uni@@ on du@@ es ? &quot; &quot; And Re@@ u@@ ther sho@@ ots back , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey H@@ en@@ ry , how are you going to get them to bu@@ y cars ? &quot; &quot; Re@@ u@@ ther &apos;s problem in that an@@ e@@ c@@ dot@@ e is that it is t@@ ough to of@@ f@@ er your lab@@ or to an econom@@ y that &apos;s full of mach@@ ines , and we see this very c@@ lear@@ ly in the st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs ."
"If you look over the past couple de@@ ca@@ des at the re@@ turns to ca@@ pi@@ tal — in other words , cor@@ por@@ ate pro@@ fi@@ ts — we see them going up , and we see that they &apos;re now at an al@@ l-@@ time high ."
"If we look at the re@@ turns to lab@@ or , in other words tot@@ al wa@@ ges pa@@ id out in the econom@@ y , we see them at an al@@ l-@@ time low and he@@ ading very quickly in the op@@ posi@@ te dire@@ ction ."
So this is c@@ lear@@ ly bad news for Re@@ u@@ ther .
"It looks like it might be great news for F@@ or@@ d , but it &apos;s actually not . If you want to se@@ ll huge vol@@ um@@ es of some@@ what ex@@ pen@@ sive go@@ ods to people , you really want a large , st@@ able , pro@@ sp@@ er@@ ous mi@@ ddle clas@@ s ."
We have had one of those in America for just about the entire post@@ war per@@ i@@ od .
But the mi@@ ddle clas@@ s is c@@ lear@@ ly under huge thre@@ at right now .
"We all know a lot of the st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs , but just to re@@ pe@@ at one of them , medi@@ an in@@ come in America has actually gone down over the past 15 years , and we &apos;re in d@@ ang@@ er of getting tra@@ pped in some vi@@ ci@@ ous cy@@ cle where in@@ equ@@ ality and po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ ation contin@@ ue to go up over time ."
The socie@@ tal challen@@ ges that come along with that kind of in@@ equ@@ ality des@@ er@@ ve some at@@ ten@@ tion .
"There are a set of socie@@ tal challen@@ ges that I &apos;m actually not that wor@@ ried about , and they &apos;re cap@@ tu@@ red by images like this ."
This is not the kind of socie@@ tal problem that I am con@@ cer@@ ned about .
"There is no shor@@ t@@ age of d@@ yst@@ op@@ i@@ an vi@@ sions about what happens when our mach@@ ines become self-@@ aw@@ are , and they deci@@ de to ri@@ se up and co@@ ordin@@ ate att@@ ac@@ ks against us ."
I &apos;m going to start wor@@ ry@@ ing about those the day my computer be@@ comes aw@@ are of my prin@@ ter .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is not the set of challen@@ ges we really need to wor@@ ry about .
"To tell you the kinds of socie@@ tal challen@@ ges that are going to come up in the new mach@@ ine age , I want to tell a story about two ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pi@@ cal American wor@@ k@@ ers ."
"And to make them really ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pi@@ cal , let &apos;s make them both white guys ."
"And the first one is a colle@@ ge@@ -@@ edu@@ c@@ ated prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal , cre@@ ative ty@@ pe , man@@ ag@@ er , engine@@ er , do@@ ctor , la@@ wy@@ er , that kind of wor@@ k@@ er ."
We &apos;re going to call him &quot; &quot; T@@ ed . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s at the top of the American mi@@ ddle clas@@ s .
"H@@ is coun@@ ter@@ part is not colle@@ ge@@ -@@ edu@@ c@@ ated and works as a lab@@ ore@@ r , works as a cl@@ er@@ k , does low@@ -@@ level white col@@ lar or blue col@@ lar work in the econom@@ y ."
"We &apos;re going to call that guy &quot; &quot; Bi@@ ll . &quot; &quot; And if you go back about 50 years , Bi@@ ll and T@@ ed were le@@ ading re@@ mark@@ ably si@@ mi@@ lar lives ."
"For example , in 19@@ 60 they were both very li@@ ke@@ ly to have fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time j@@ ob@@ s , working at least 40 hours a week ."
"But as the social resear@@ ch@@ er Ch@@ ar@@ les M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y has do@@ cu@@ men@@ ted , as we started to au@@ tom@@ ate the econom@@ y , and 19@@ 60 is just about when compu@@ ters started to be used by bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es , as we started to pro@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vely in@@ je@@ ct technology and au@@ tom@@ ation and di@@ gi@@ tal stuff into the econom@@ y , the for@@ tu@@ n@@ es of Bi@@ ll and T@@ ed di@@ ver@@ g@@ ed a lot ."
"O@@ ver this time fra@@ me , T@@ ed has contin@@ u@@ ed to h@@ old a fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time job . Bi@@ ll ha@@ sn &apos;t ."
"In many c@@ ases , Bi@@ ll has left the econom@@ y enti@@ re@@ ly , and T@@ ed very r@@ are@@ ly has ."
"O@@ ver time , T@@ ed &apos;s mar@@ ri@@ age has sta@@ yed quite happy ."
Bi@@ ll &apos;s ha@@ sn &apos;t .
"And T@@ ed &apos;s kids have grow@@ n up in a two@@ -@@ par@@ ent home , while Bi@@ ll &apos;s absolu@@ tely have not over time ."
O@@ ther ways that Bi@@ ll is dro@@ pping out of society ?
"He &apos;s de@@ cre@@ as@@ ed his v@@ ot@@ ing in pre@@ si@@ den@@ tial ele@@ ctions , and he &apos;s started to go to pri@@ son a lot more often ."
"So I cannot tell a happy story about these social tr@@ en@@ ds , and they don &apos;t show any sig@@ ns of re@@ ver@@ sing themselves ."
"They &apos;re also true no matter which e@@ th@@ nic group or demo@@ gra@@ phi@@ c group we look at , and they &apos;re actually getting so se@@ v@@ ere that they &apos;re in d@@ ang@@ er of over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming even the amazing pro@@ gre@@ ss we made with the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ igh@@ ts Mo@@ v@@ ement ."
And what my friends in S@@ i@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ ley and C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge are over@@ looking is that they &apos;re T@@ ed .
"They &apos;re living these amaz@@ ing@@ ly bus@@ y , produ@@ ctive lives , and they &apos;ve got all the b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts to show from that , while Bi@@ ll is le@@ ading a very different life ."
"They &apos;re actually both pro@@ of of how right V@@ ol@@ ta@@ i@@ re was when he tal@@ ked about the b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts of work , and the fact that it sa@@ ves us from not one but three great evi@@ ls ."
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; W@@ ork sa@@ ves a man from three great evi@@ ls : bo@@ re@@ dom , vice and need . &quot; &quot; — V@@ ol@@ ta@@ i@@ re &#93; So with these challen@@ ges , what do we do about them ?"
"The economic pla@@ y@@ book is sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly clear , sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward , in the shor@@ t ter@@ m es@@ pe@@ cially ."
"The rob@@ ots are not going to take all of our j@@ ob@@ s in the next year or two , so the clas@@ si@@ c E@@ c@@ on 10@@ 1 pla@@ y@@ book is going to work just f@@ ine : En@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship , d@@ ou@@ ble down on in@@ fra@@ structure , and make sure we &apos;re tur@@ ning out people from our edu@@ c@@ ational system with the appro@@ pri@@ ate sk@@ il@@ ls ."
"But over the longer ter@@ m , if we are moving into an econom@@ y that &apos;s he@@ av@@ y on technology and light on lab@@ or , and we are , then we have to consi@@ der some more radi@@ cal inter@@ ven@@ tions , for example , something like a gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed min@@ i@@ mu@@ m in@@ come ."
"Now , that &apos;s probably making some fol@@ k in this room un@@ comfor@@ table , because that idea is as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with the extre@@ me left w@@ ing and with fa@@ ir@@ ly radi@@ cal sch@@ em@@ es for re@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ting we@@ alth ."
"I did a little bit of research on this noti@@ on , and it might cal@@ m some fol@@ k down to know that the idea of a net gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed min@@ i@@ mu@@ m in@@ come has been ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on@@ ed by those fro@@ thin@@ g@@ -@@ at@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ m@@ outh so@@ ci@@ ali@@ sts F@@ r@@ ie@@ dri@@ ch Ha@@ ye@@ k , Ri@@ ch@@ ard Ni@@ x@@ on and M@@ il@@ ton F@@ r@@ ie@@ d@@ man ."
"And if you find yourself wor@@ ried that something like a gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed in@@ come is going to sti@@ f@@ le our dri@@ ve to suc@@ ce@@ ed and make us kind of com@@ plac@@ ent , you might be interested to know that social mo@@ bility , one of the things we really pri@@ de ourselves on in the United States , is now low@@ er than it is in the nor@@ ther@@ n Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an countries that have these very gener@@ ous social sa@@ fe@@ ty ne@@ ts ."
So the economic pla@@ y@@ book is actually pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward .
The socie@@ tal one is a lot more challen@@ g@@ ing .
I don &apos;t know what the pla@@ y@@ book is for getting Bi@@ ll to eng@@ age and st@@ ay eng@@ aged throu@@ gh@@ out life .
I do know that education is a huge part of it .
I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and .
"I was a M@@ on@@ te@@ s@@ sor@@ i kid for the first few years of my education , and what that education t@@ au@@ ght me is that the world is an interesting place and my job is to go expl@@ ore it ."
"The school stop@@ ped in third gra@@ de , so then I en@@ ter@@ ed the public school system , and it felt like I had been s@@ ent to the G@@ u@@ la@@ g ."
"Wi@@ th the b@@ en@@ ef@@ it of h@@ in@@ d@@ si@@ ght , I now know the job was to pre@@ p@@ are me for life as a cl@@ er@@ k or a lab@@ ore@@ r , but at the time it felt like the job was to kind of bor@@ e me into some sub@@ mis@@ sion with what was going on around me ."
We have to do better than this .
We cannot keep tur@@ ning out B@@ il@@ ls .
So we see some green sho@@ ots that things are getting better .
"We see technology de@@ e@@ ply impac@@ ting education and eng@@ ag@@ ing people , from our youn@@ gest lear@@ n@@ ers up to our ol@@ d@@ est ones ."
We see very pro@@ min@@ ent business vo@@ i@@ ces tel@@ ling us we need to re@@ think some of the things that we &apos;ve been hol@@ ding de@@ ar for a while .
And we see very seri@@ ous and susta@@ ined and d@@ at@@ a@@ -@@ dri@@ ven ef@@ for@@ ts to understand how to inter@@ ven@@ e in some of the most t@@ rou@@ b@@ led communi@@ ties that we have .
So the green sho@@ ots are out there .
I don &apos;t want to pre@@ ten@@ d for a minu@@ te that what we have is going to be enough .
We &apos;re fac@@ ing very t@@ ough challen@@ ges .
"To give just one example , there are about five million Ameri@@ cans who have been u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ yed for at least six months ."
We &apos;re not going to fi@@ x things for them by sen@@ ding them back to M@@ on@@ te@@ s@@ sor@@ i .
And my bi@@ ggest wor@@ ry is that we &apos;re cre@@ ating a world where we &apos;re going to have g@@ lit@@ ter@@ ing technolog@@ ies em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in kind of a sha@@ b@@ by society and sup@@ por@@ ted by an econom@@ y that gener@@ ates in@@ equ@@ ality instead of opportunity .
But I actually don &apos;t think that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I think we &apos;re going to do something a lot better for one very stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward reason : The fac@@ ts are getting out there .
The reali@@ ties of this new mach@@ ine age and the change in the econom@@ y are be@@ coming more wi@@ de@@ ly known .
"If we wanted to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate that process , we could do things like have our best econom@@ ist@@ s and poli@@ cy@@ mak@@ ers play &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy ! &quot; &quot; against W@@ at@@ son ."
We could sen@@ d Con@@ gre@@ ss on an au@@ ton@@ om@@ ous car ro@@ ad tri@@ p .
"And if we do enough of these kinds of things , the aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess is going to sin@@ k in that things are going to be different ."
"And then we &apos;re off to the rac@@ es , because I don &apos;t believe for a second that we have for@@ got@@ ten how to sol@@ ve t@@ ough challen@@ ges or that we have become too a@@ pa@@ the@@ tic or har@@ d-@@ hear@@ ted to even try ."
I started my talk with quot@@ es from wor@@ d@@ smi@@ ths who were se@@ par@@ ated by an ocean and a century .
Let me end it with words from poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans who were si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ly di@@ st@@ ant .
"W@@ in@@ st@@ on Ch@@ ur@@ chi@@ ll came to my home of M@@ I@@ T in 19@@ 4@@ 9 , and he said , &quot; &quot; If we are to bring the bro@@ ad mas@@ ses of the people in every land to the table of ab@@ un@@ dance , it can only be by the ti@@ rel@@ ess impro@@ v@@ ement of all of our means of techni@@ cal produ@@ ction . &quot; &quot; A@@ bra@@ ha@@ m L@@ in@@ col@@ n realized there was one other in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ t ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I am a fir@@ m belie@@ ver in the people ."
"If given the tru@@ th , they can be depen@@ ded upo@@ n to me@@ et any national cri@@ sis ."
"The great point is to give them the pla@@ in fac@@ ts . &quot; &quot; So the op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic not@@ e , great point that I want to leave you with is that the pla@@ in fac@@ ts of the mach@@ ine age are be@@ coming clear , and I have every con@@ fi@@ dence that we &apos;re going to use them to char@@ t a good course into the challen@@ g@@ ing , ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant econom@@ y that we &apos;re cre@@ ating ."
Thank you very much .

"We don &apos;t know why we should be arti@@ sts , but we have many reas@@ ons why we can &apos;t be ."
Why do people in@@ stan@@ tly resi@@ st the idea of as@@ so@@ ci@@ ating themselves with art ?
P@@ er@@ haps you think art is for the gre@@ at@@ ly gi@@ f@@ ted or for the th@@ o@@ rou@@ gh@@ ly and prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ ally tra@@ ined .
And some of you may think you &apos;ve stra@@ yed too far from art .
"Well you might have , but I don &apos;t think so ."
This is the the@@ me of my talk today .
We are all born arti@@ sts .
"If you have kids , you know what I mean ."
Al@@ most everything kids do is art .
They dra@@ w with c@@ ra@@ y@@ ons on the w@@ all .
"They dance to S@@ on D@@ am B@@ i &apos;s dance on T@@ V , but you can &apos;t even call it S@@ on D@@ am B@@ i &apos;s dance — it be@@ comes the kids &apos; own dance ."
So they dance a str@@ ange dance and in@@ fli@@ ct their sing@@ ing on everyone .
"P@@ er@@ haps their art is something only their parents can be@@ ar , and because they prac@@ ti@@ ce such art all day long , people hon@@ est@@ ly get a little ti@@ red around kids ."
K@@ i@@ ds will sometimes per@@ form mon@@ od@@ ra@@ m@@ as — playing house is in@@ de@@ ed a mon@@ od@@ ra@@ ma or a play .
"And some kids , when they get a bit ol@@ der , start to lie ."
U@@ su@@ ally parents remember the very first time their kid l@@ ies .
They &apos;re sh@@ oc@@ ked .
"&quot; Now you &apos;re show@@ ing your true col@@ ors , &quot; M@@ om says . She thin@@ ks , &quot; Why does he take after his d@@ ad ? &quot;"
"S@@ he questions him , &quot; &quot; What kind of a person are you going to be ? &quot; &quot; But you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t wor@@ ry ."
The moment kids start to lie is the moment stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ling begin@@ s .
They are talking about things they didn &apos;t see .
It &apos;s amazing . It &apos;s a wonderful moment .
Par@@ ents should ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate .
&quot; H@@ ur@@ ra@@ y ! My bo@@ y finally started to lie ! &quot;
All right ! It cal@@ ls for ce@@ le@@ br@@ ation .
"For example , a kid says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , gu@@ ess what ? I met an al@@ ie@@ n on my way home . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en a ty@@ pi@@ cal mo@@ m respon@@ ds , &quot; &quot; S@@ top that n@@ on@@ sense . &quot; &quot; Now , an ide@@ al par@@ ent is someone who respon@@ ds like this : &quot; &quot; Re@@ ally ? A@@ n al@@ ie@@ n , hu@@ h ? What did it look like ? D@@ id it say anything ?"
"W@@ here did you me@@ et it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ m , in front of the super@@ market . &quot; &quot; When you have a convers@@ ation like this , the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be respon@@ si@@ ble for what he started ."
"S@@ o@@ on , a story develo@@ ps ."
"O@@ f course this is an in@@ fan@@ ti@@ le story , but thinking up one s@@ ent@@ ence after the next is the same thing a prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal wri@@ ter like me does ."
"In essen@@ ce , they are not different ."
"R@@ ol@@ and Bar@@ the@@ s once said of F@@ l@@ au@@ ber@@ t &apos;s no@@ v@@ els , &quot; &quot; F@@ l@@ au@@ ber@@ t did not write a no@@ vel ."
He mer@@ ely conne@@ cted one s@@ ent@@ ence after another .
"The er@@ os between s@@ ent@@ ences , that is the essen@@ ce of F@@ l@@ au@@ ber@@ t &apos;s no@@ vel . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s right — a no@@ vel , basically , is writing one s@@ ent@@ ence , then , without viol@@ ating the sc@@ op@@ e of the first one , writing the next s@@ ent@@ ence ."
And you contin@@ ue to make conne@@ ctions .
"T@@ ake a look at this s@@ ent@@ ence : &quot; One morning , as Gre@@ g@@ or S@@ am@@ sa was wa@@ king up from an@@ x@@ i@@ ous dre@@ am@@ s , he disco@@ vered that in his bed he had been changed into a mon@@ st@@ rou@@ s ver@@ min@@ ous bu@@ g . &quot;"
"@@ Yes , it &apos;s the first s@@ ent@@ ence of Fran@@ z K@@ af@@ ka &apos;s &quot; &quot; The M@@ et@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ osi@@ s . &quot; &quot; W@@ ri@@ ting such an un@@ ju@@ sti@@ fi@@ able s@@ ent@@ ence and contin@@ u@@ ing in order to ju@@ sti@@ fy it , K@@ af@@ ka &apos;s work became the ma@@ ster@@ piece of con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary liter@@ ature ."
K@@ af@@ ka did not show his work to his father .
He was not on good terms with his father .
"O@@ n his own , he wro@@ te these s@@ ent@@ ences ."
"H@@ ad he sh@@ own his father , &quot; &quot; My bo@@ y has finally lost it , &quot; &quot; he would &apos;ve thought ."
"And that &apos;s right . Ar@@ t is about going a little nu@@ ts and ju@@ sti@@ f@@ ying the next s@@ ent@@ ence , which is not much different from what a kid does ."
A kid who has just started to lie is taking the first ste@@ p as a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler .
K@@ i@@ ds do art .
They don &apos;t get ti@@ red and they have fun doing it .
I was in Je@@ ju Is@@ land a few days ago .
"When kids are on the be@@ ach , most of them love playing in the water ."
"But some of them spend a lot of time in the s@@ and , making m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins and se@@ as — well , not se@@ as , but different things — people and do@@ gs , et@@ c ."
"But parents tell them , &quot; It will all be wa@@ shed away by the wa@@ ves . &quot;"
"In other words , it &apos;s us@@ el@@ ess ."
There &apos;s no need .
But kids don &apos;t mind .
They have fun in the moment and they keep playing in the s@@ and .
K@@ i@@ ds don &apos;t do it because someone told them to .
"They ar@@ en &apos;t told by their b@@ os@@ s or any@@ one , they just do it ."
"When you were little , I be@@ t you spent time en@@ jo@@ ying the ple@@ as@@ ure of pri@@ mi@@ tive art ."
"When I ask my students to write about their ha@@ p@@ pie@@ st moment , many write about an early arti@@ stic experience they had as a kid ."
"L@@ ear@@ ning to play pi@@ ano for the first time and playing four h@@ ands with a friend , or perform@@ ing a ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous sk@@ it with friends looking like i@@ di@@ ots — things like that ."
O@@ r the moment you develo@@ ped the first film you sh@@ ot with an old cam@@ era .
They talk about these kinds of exper@@ ien@@ ces .
You must have had such a moment .
"In that moment , art makes you happy because it &apos;s not work ."
"W@@ ork doesn &apos;t make you happy , does it ? M@@ ost@@ ly it &apos;s t@@ ough ."
The F@@ ren@@ ch wri@@ ter Mi@@ ch@@ el T@@ our@@ nie@@ r has a fam@@ ous saying .
"It &apos;s a bit mis@@ ch@@ ie@@ v@@ ous , actually ."
&quot; W@@ ork is against human nature . The pro@@ of is that it makes us ti@@ red . &quot;
R@@ ight ? Why would work ti@@ re us if it &apos;s in our nature ?
P@@ la@@ ying doesn &apos;t ti@@ re us .
We can play all night long .
"If we work over@@ night , we should be pa@@ id for over@@ time ."
Why ? Because it &apos;s ti@@ ring and we feel f@@ ati@@ gu@@ e .
"But kids , usu@@ ally they do art for fun . It &apos;s playing ."
They don &apos;t dra@@ w to se@@ ll the work to a cl@@ ien@@ t or play the pi@@ ano to ear@@ n money for the family .
"O@@ f course , there were kids who had to ."
"You know this g@@ ent@@ le@@ man , right ?"
"He had to t@@ our around Europ@@ e to sup@@ port his family — W@@ ol@@ f@@ g@@ an@@ g A@@ ma@@ de@@ us Mo@@ zar@@ t — but that was cen@@ tur@@ ies ago , so we can make him an ex@@ cep@@ tion ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , at some point our art — such a jo@@ y@@ ful pa@@ sti@@ me — en@@ ds ."
"K@@ i@@ ds have to go to l@@ ess@@ ons , to school , do h@@ ome@@ work and of course they take pi@@ ano or bal@@ let l@@ ess@@ ons , but they ar@@ en &apos;t fun any@@ more ."
You &apos;re told to do it and there &apos;s compe@@ ti@@ tion . How can it be fun ?
"If you &apos;re in ele@@ ment@@ ary school and you still dra@@ w on the w@@ all , you &apos;ll su@@ re@@ ly get in t@@ rou@@ ble with your mo@@ m ."
"Be@@ si@@ des , if you contin@@ ue to act like an arti@@ st as you get ol@@ der , you &apos;ll incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly feel pres@@ sure — people will question your ac@@ tions and ask you to act pro@@ per@@ ly ."
Here &apos;s my story : I was an e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ der and I en@@ ter@@ ed a d@@ raw@@ ing con@@ test at school in G@@ ye@@ on@@ g@@ bo@@ k@@ g@@ ung .
"I was trying my best , and my teach@@ er came around and asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m d@@ raw@@ ing di@@ li@@ g@@ ently , &quot; &quot; I said ."
&quot; Why are you using only black ? &quot;
"In@@ de@@ ed , I was e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly col@@ or@@ ing the sk@@ et@@ ch@@ book in black ."
"And I expla@@ ined , &quot; It &apos;s a dar@@ k night and a cro@@ w is per@@ ching on a bran@@ ch . &quot;"
"Th@@ en my teach@@ er said , &quot; Re@@ ally ? Well , Y@@ oun@@ g@@ -@@ h@@ a , you may not be good at d@@ raw@@ ing but you have a tal@@ ent for stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ling . &quot;"
O@@ r so I wi@@ shed .
"&quot; &quot; Now you &apos;ll get it , you ra@@ sc@@ al ! &quot; &quot; was the respon@@ se . ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll get it ! &quot; &quot; he said ."
"You were sup@@ posed to dra@@ w the pal@@ ace , the G@@ ye@@ on@@ gh@@ o@@ er@@ u , et@@ c . , but I was col@@ or@@ ing everything in black , so he dra@@ gg@@ ed me out of the group ."
"There were a lot of girls there as well , so I was ut@@ ter@@ ly mor@@ ti@@ f@@ ied ."
"N@@ one of my ex@@ plan@@ ations or ex@@ c@@ uses were heard , and I really got it big time ."
"If he was an ide@@ al teach@@ er , he would have respon@@ ded like I said before , &quot; &quot; Y@@ oun@@ g@@ -@@ h@@ a may not have a tal@@ ent for d@@ raw@@ ing , but he has a gi@@ ft for making up stories , &quot; &quot; and he would have en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed me ."
But such a teach@@ er is sel@@ dom found .
"L@@ ater , I gre@@ w up and went to Europ@@ e &apos;s gal@@ l@@ er@@ ies — I was a uni@@ versity stud@@ ent — and I thought this was really un@@ fa@@ ir ."
L@@ ook what I found . ( Laughter ) Wor@@ ks like this were hun@@ g in B@@ as@@ el while I was pu@@ ni@@ shed and sto@@ od in front of the pal@@ ace with my d@@ raw@@ ing in my m@@ outh .
L@@ ook at this . D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t it look just like wal@@ l@@ pa@@ per ?
"C@@ on@@ tem@@ por@@ ary art , I later disco@@ vered , isn &apos;t expla@@ ined by a l@@ ame story like m@@ ine ."
No c@@ row@@ s are brought up .
"Mo@@ st of the works have no ti@@ tle , U@@ n@@ ti@@ t@@ led ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ ways , con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary art in the 20@@ th century is about doing something we@@ ird and fil@@ ling the vo@@ id with ex@@ plan@@ ation and inter@@ pret@@ ation — essen@@ ti@@ ally the same as I did ."
"O@@ f course , my work was very am@@ ate@@ ur , but let &apos;s turn to more fam@@ ous exam@@ ples ."
This is P@@ i@@ c@@ as@@ so &apos;s .
"He stu@@ ck hand@@ le@@ bar@@ s into a bi@@ ke se@@ at and called it &quot; &quot; Bu@@ ll &apos;s H@@ e@@ ad . &quot; &quot; S@@ oun@@ ds con@@ v@@ in@@ cing , right ?"
"N@@ ex@@ t , a ur@@ in@@ al was plac@@ ed on its side and called &quot; &quot; F@@ oun@@ tain &quot; &quot; ."
That was D@@ uch@@ am@@ p .
So fil@@ ling the ga@@ p between ex@@ plan@@ ation and a we@@ ird act with stories — that &apos;s in@@ de@@ ed what con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary art is all about .
"P@@ i@@ c@@ as@@ so even made the stat@@ ement , &quot; I dra@@ w not what I see but what I think . &quot;"
"@@ Yes , it means I didn &apos;t have to dra@@ w G@@ ye@@ on@@ gh@@ o@@ er@@ u ."
I wi@@ sh I knew what P@@ i@@ c@@ as@@ so said back then . I could have ar@@ gu@@ ed better with my teach@@ er .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , the little arti@@ sts within us are cho@@ ked to death before we get to fi@@ ght against the op@@ pres@@ sor@@ s of art ."
They get lo@@ cked in .
That &apos;s our tra@@ ge@@ dy .
"So what happens when little arti@@ sts get lo@@ cked in , b@@ ani@@ shed or even kil@@ led ?"
O@@ ur arti@@ stic de@@ si@@ re doesn &apos;t go away .
"We want to ex@@ pre@@ ss , to re@@ ve@@ al ourselves , but with the arti@@ st de@@ ad , the arti@@ stic de@@ si@@ re re@@ ve@@ als itself in dar@@ k form ."
"In kar@@ a@@ o@@ ke bar@@ s , there are always people who sing &quot; She &apos;s G@@ one &quot; or &quot; H@@ ot@@ el C@@ alifor@@ nia , &quot; mi@@ ming the gu@@ it@@ ar ri@@ f@@ f@@ s ."
U@@ su@@ ally they sound aw@@ ful . A@@ w@@ ful in@@ de@@ ed .
S@@ ome people turn into ro@@ ck@@ ers like this .
O@@ r some people dance in clu@@ b@@ s .
Pe@@ ople who would have en@@ jo@@ yed tel@@ ling stories end up tro@@ l@@ ling on the Inter@@ net all night long .
That &apos;s how a writing tal@@ ent re@@ ve@@ als itself on the dar@@ k side .
S@@ ome@@ times we see d@@ ads get more exci@@ ted than their kids playing with Le@@ go@@ s or pu@@ tting together pla@@ stic rob@@ ots .
"They go , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t tou@@ ch it . D@@ ad@@ dy will do it for you . &quot; &quot; The kid has already lost inter@@ est and is doing something else , but the d@@ ad alone buil@@ ds ca@@ st@@ les ."
"This shows the arti@@ stic im@@ pul@@ ses inside us are sup@@ pres@@ sed , not gone ."
"But they can often re@@ ve@@ al themselves neg@@ ati@@ vely , in the form of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y ."
You know the s@@ ong &quot; &quot; I would love to be on T@@ V &quot; &quot; ? Why would we love it ?
"T@@ V is full of people who do what we wi@@ shed to do , but never got to ."
"They dance , they act — and the more they do , they are pra@@ is@@ ed ."
So we start to en@@ v@@ y them .
We become di@@ ct@@ at@@ ors with a re@@ mot@@ e and start to cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze the people on T@@ V .
&quot; He just can &apos;t act . &quot; &quot; You call that sing@@ ing ? She can &apos;t h@@ it the not@@ es . &quot;
We e@@ a@@ si@@ ly say these sor@@ ts of things .
"We get je@@ al@@ ous , not because we &apos;re evi@@ l , but because we have little arti@@ sts p@@ ent up inside us ."
That &apos;s what I think .
What should we do then ?
"@@ Yes , that &apos;s right ."
"R@@ ight now , we need to start our own art ."
"R@@ ight this minu@@ te , we can turn off T@@ V , lo@@ g off the Inter@@ net , get up and start to do something ."
"W@@ here I te@@ ach students in dra@@ ma school , there &apos;s a course called D@@ ra@@ m@@ ati@@ cs ."
"In this course , all students must put on a play ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , ac@@ ting maj@@ ors are not sup@@ posed to act ."
"They can write the play , for example , and the wri@@ ters may work on st@@ age art ."
"L@@ i@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , st@@ age art maj@@ ors may become ac@@ t@@ ors , and in this way you put on a show ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents at first won@@ der whether they can actually do it , but later they have so much fun . I r@@ are@@ ly see any@@ one who is mi@@ ser@@ able doing a play ."
"In school , the mi@@ lit@@ ary or even in a ment@@ al institu@@ tion , once you make people do it , they en@@ jo@@ y it ."
I saw this happen in the ar@@ my — many people had fun doing pla@@ ys .
"I have another experience : In my writing clas@@ s , I give students a spe@@ cial as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment ."
I have students like you in the clas@@ s — many who don &apos;t major in writing .
S@@ ome major in art or music and think they can &apos;t write .
So I give them bl@@ ank sh@@ e@@ ets of pa@@ per and a the@@ me .
It can be a simple the@@ me : W@@ ri@@ te about the most un@@ for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate experience in your chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od .
There &apos;s one con@@ di@@ tion : You must write like c@@ razy . Li@@ ke c@@ razy !
"I walk around and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge them , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome on , come on ! &quot; &quot; They have to write like c@@ razy for an hour or two ."
They only get to think for the first five minutes .
"The reason I make them write like c@@ razy is because when you write s@@ low@@ ly and lots of thou@@ ghts c@@ ross your mind , the arti@@ stic de@@ vi@@ l cre@@ e@@ ps in ."
This de@@ vi@@ l will tell you hundre@@ ds of reas@@ ons why you can &apos;t write : &quot; &quot; Pe@@ ople will l@@ au@@ gh at you . This is not good writing !
What kind of s@@ ent@@ ence is this ? L@@ ook at your hand@@ writing ! &quot; &quot; It will say a lot of things .
You have to run f@@ ast so the de@@ vi@@ l can &apos;t cat@@ ch up .
"The really good writing I &apos;ve seen in my clas@@ s was not from the as@@ sig@@ n@@ ments with a long de@@ ad@@ line , but from the 4@@ 0@@ - to 6@@ 0-@@ minu@@ te c@@ razy writing students did in front of me with a pen@@ ci@@ l ."
The students go into a kind of tr@@ ance .
"A@@ f@@ ter 30 or 40 minutes , they write without know@@ ing what they &apos;re writing ."
"And in this moment , the na@@ gg@@ ing de@@ vi@@ l disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars ."
"So I can say this : It &apos;s not the hundre@@ ds of reas@@ ons why one can &apos;t be an arti@@ st , but rather , the one reason one must be that makes us arti@@ sts ."
Why we cannot be something is not important .
Mo@@ st arti@@ sts became arti@@ sts because of the one reason .
"When we put the de@@ vi@@ l in our heart to sle@@ ep and start our own art , ene@@ mie@@ s ap@@ pe@@ ar on the outside ."
"M@@ ost@@ ly , they have the fac@@ es of our parents . ( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times they look like our spo@@ uses , but they are not your parents or spo@@ uses ."
They are de@@ vi@@ ls . De@@ vi@@ ls .
"They came to Earth br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly trans@@ form@@ ed to stop you from being arti@@ stic , from be@@ coming arti@@ sts ."
And they have a mag@@ ic question .
"When we say , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;ll try ac@@ ting . There &apos;s a dra@@ ma school in the community cen@@ ter , &quot; &quot; or &quot; I &apos;d like to learn I@@ t@@ ali@@ an son@@ gs , &quot; they ask , &quot; Oh , ye@@ ah ? A play ? What for ? &quot;"
"The mag@@ ic question is , &quot; &quot; What for ? &quot; &quot; But art is not for anything ."
Ar@@ t is the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate go@@ al .
It sa@@ ves our s@@ ou@@ ls and makes us live ha@@ p@@ pi@@ ly .
It hel@@ ps us ex@@ pre@@ ss ourselves and be happy without the help of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l or dru@@ gs .
"So in respon@@ se to such a pra@@ g@@ m@@ atic question , we need to be b@@ old ."
"&quot; Well , just for the fun of it . S@@ or@@ ry for having fun without you , &quot; is what you should say . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll just go a@@ head and do it any@@ way . &quot; &quot; The ide@@ al future I imagine is where we all have mul@@ ti@@ ple iden@@ ti@@ ties , at least one of which is an arti@@ st ."
"O@@ n@@ ce I was in New York and got in a ca@@ b . I took the back@@ se@@ at , and in front of me I saw something re@@ lated to a play ."
"So I asked the dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; He said it was his pro@@ fi@@ le . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en what are you ? &quot; &quot; I asked . &quot; &quot; A@@ n ac@@ tor , &quot; &quot; he said ."
"He was a c@@ ab@@ by and an ac@@ tor . I asked , &quot; &quot; What ro@@ les do you usu@@ ally play ? &quot; &quot; He pro@@ ud@@ ly said he pla@@ yed K@@ ing Le@@ ar . K@@ ing Le@@ ar ."
"&quot; &quot; Wh@@ o is it that can tell me who I am ? &quot; &quot; — a great line from K@@ ing Le@@ ar . That &apos;s the world I dre@@ am of . S@@ ome@@ one is a g@@ ol@@ f@@ er by day and wri@@ ter by night . O@@ r a c@@ ab@@ by and an ac@@ tor , a ban@@ k@@ er and a pain@@ ter ,"
se@@ cre@@ tly or publi@@ c@@ ly perform@@ ing their own ar@@ ts .
"In 199@@ 0 , Mar@@ th@@ a G@@ ra@@ ha@@ m , the leg@@ end of moder@@ n dance , came to Kore@@ a ."
"The great arti@@ st , then in her 9@@ 0s , ar@@ ri@@ ved at G@@ im@@ po A@@ ir@@ port and a re@@ por@@ ter asked her a ty@@ pi@@ cal question : &quot; &quot; What do you have to do to become a great dan@@ cer ?"
"A@@ ny ad@@ vice for as@@ pi@@ ring Kore@@ an dan@@ c@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; Now , she was the ma@@ ster . This ph@@ oto was taken in 19@@ 4@@ 8 and she was already a ce@@ le@@ br@@ ated arti@@ st ."
"In 199@@ 0 , she was asked this question ."
And here &apos;s what she ans@@ wer@@ ed : &quot; J@@ ust do it . &quot;
W@@ ow . I was tou@@ ched .
O@@ n@@ ly those three words and she left the air@@ port . That &apos;s it .
So what should we do now ?
"L@@ et &apos;s be arti@@ sts , right now . R@@ ight away . How ?"
J@@ ust do it !
Thank you .
( Applause )
"As a sing@@ er@@ -@@ son@@ g@@ wri@@ ter , people often ask me about my in@@ flu@@ ences or , as I like to call them , my son@@ ic lin@@ e@@ ages ."
"And I could e@@ a@@ si@@ ly tell you that I was sha@@ ped by the j@@ az@@ z and hi@@ p ho@@ p that I gre@@ w up with , by the E@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ an h@@ eri@@ t@@ age of my an@@ c@@ est@@ ors , or by the 19@@ 8@@ 0s po@@ p on my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od radi@@ o st@@ ations ."
"But be@@ y@@ ond gen@@ re , there is another question : how do the sounds we hear every day in@@ flu@@ ence the music that we make ?"
"I believe that every@@ day soun@@ d@@ s@@ cape can be the most u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation for son@@ g@@ writing , and to look at this idea a little bit more clo@@ se@@ ly , I &apos;m going to talk today about three things : nature , language and sil@@ ence — or rather , the im@@ possi@@ bility of true sil@@ ence ."
"And through this I hope to give you a sense of a world already ali@@ ve with musi@@ cal ex@@ pres@@ sion , with each of us ser@@ ving as ac@@ tive parti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts , whether we know it or not ."
"I &apos;m going to start today with nature , but before we do that , let &apos;s quickly list@@ en to this s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ t of an op@@ era sing@@ er war@@ ming up ."
Here it is .
"( S@@ ing@@ ing ) ( S@@ ing@@ ing en@@ ds ) It &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?"
G@@ ot@@ ch@@ a !
That is actually not the sound of an op@@ era sing@@ er war@@ ming up .
That is the sound of a bir@@ d s@@ low@@ ed down to a p@@ ace that the human e@@ ar mist@@ ak@@ en@@ ly re@@ cogni@@ z@@ es as its own .
"It was rele@@ as@@ ed as part of Pe@@ ter Sz@@ ö@@ ke &apos;s 19@@ 8@@ 7 H@@ un@@ g@@ ari@@ an recor@@ ding &quot; The U@@ n@@ known Music of B@@ ir@@ ds , &quot; where he recor@@ ds many bir@@ ds and s@@ low@@ s down their pit@@ ch@@ es to re@@ ve@@ al what &apos;s under@@ ne@@ ath ."
Let &apos;s list@@ en to the fu@@ ll@@ -@@ speed recor@@ ding .
"( B@@ ird sing@@ ing ) Now , let &apos;s hear the two of them together so your brain can ju@@ x@@ ta@@ pos@@ e them ."
( B@@ ird sing@@ ing at s@@ low then full speed ) ( S@@ ing@@ ing en@@ ds ) It &apos;s incredible .
P@@ er@@ haps the techni@@ qu@@ es of op@@ era sing@@ ing were inspi@@ red by bir@@ d@@ s@@ ong .
"As hum@@ ans , we in@@ tu@@ i@@ ti@@ vely understand bir@@ ds to be our musi@@ cal teach@@ ers ."
"In E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , bir@@ ds are consi@@ der@@ ed an inte@@ gra@@ l part of the ori@@ g@@ in of music itself ."
"The story goes like this : 1@@ ,@@ 500 years ago , a young man was born in the E@@ m@@ pi@@ re of A@@ k@@ su@@ m , a major tra@@ ding cen@@ ter of the an@@ cient world ."
H@@ is name was Y@@ ared .
"When Y@@ ared was seven years old his father d@@ ied , and his mother s@@ ent him to go live with an un@@ cle , who was a pr@@ ie@@ st of the E@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ an O@@ r@@ th@@ od@@ o@@ x tra@@ di@@ tion , one of the ol@@ d@@ est ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es in the world ."
"Now , this tra@@ di@@ tion has an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship and lear@@ ning , and Y@@ ared had to study and study and study and study , and one day he was stu@@ dy@@ ing under a t@@ ree , when three bir@@ ds came to him ."
"One by one , these bir@@ ds became his teach@@ ers ."
"They t@@ au@@ ght him music — sc@@ al@@ es , in fact ."
"And Y@@ ared , ev@@ en@@ tually re@@ cogni@@ zed as S@@ a@@ int Y@@ ared , used these sc@@ al@@ es to com@@ pos@@ e five vol@@ um@@ es of ch@@ an@@ ts and hy@@ m@@ ns for wor@@ ship and ce@@ le@@ br@@ ation ."
And he used these sc@@ al@@ es to com@@ pos@@ e and to create an indi@@ gen@@ ous musi@@ cal not@@ ation system .
"And these sc@@ al@@ es ev@@ olved into what is known as ki@@ ñ@@ it , the uni@@ qu@@ e , p@@ ent@@ at@@ on@@ ic , fi@@ ve@@ -@@ not@@ e , mo@@ d@@ al system that is very much ali@@ ve and th@@ ri@@ ving and still ev@@ ol@@ ving in E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia today ."
"Now , I love this story because it &apos;s true at mul@@ ti@@ ple le@@ v@@ els ."
"S@@ a@@ int Y@@ ared was a real , histori@@ cal figure , and the natural world can be our musi@@ cal teach@@ er ."
And we have so many exam@@ ples of this : the P@@ y@@ g@@ mie@@ s of the Con@@ go tu@@ ne their instru@@ ments to the pit@@ ch@@ es of the bir@@ ds in the fore@@ st around them .

And coun@@ t@@ less works of music were inspi@@ red by bir@@ d and fore@@ st s@@ ong .
"@@ Yes , the natural world can be our cul@@ tu@@ ral teach@@ er ."
So let &apos;s go now to the uni@@ qu@@ ely human world of language .
"E@@ very language communi@@ c@@ ates with pit@@ ch to v@@ ar@@ ying de@@ gre@@ es , whether it &apos;s M@@ and@@ ar@@ in Chin@@ ese , where a shi@@ ft in me@@ lo@@ di@@ c in@@ f@@ le@@ ction gi@@ ves the same ph@@ one@@ tic sy@@ ll@@ able an enti@@ re@@ ly different me@@ an@@ ing , to a language like En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , where a ra@@ is@@ ed pit@@ ch at the end of a s@@ ent@@ ence ..."
( Go@@ ing up in pit@@ ch ) im@@ pl@@ ies a question ?
"( Laughter ) A@@ s an E@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ an@@ -@@ American woman , I gre@@ w up around the language of Am@@ har@@ ic , Am@@ h@@ ari@@ ñ@@ a ."
"It was my first language , the language of my parents , one of the ma@@ in langu@@ ages of E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia ."
"And there are a million reas@@ ons to f@@ all in love with this language : its de@@ p@@ th of po@@ e@@ ti@@ cs , its d@@ ou@@ ble ent@@ en@@ dre@@ s , its wa@@ x and g@@ old , its hu@@ mo@@ r , its pro@@ ver@@ b@@ s that il@@ lu@@ min@@ ate the wi@@ s@@ dom and fol@@ l@@ ies of life ."
"But there &apos;s also this me@@ lo@@ di@@ ci@@ sm , a musi@@ c@@ ality built right in ."
And I find this di@@ st@@ il@@ led most c@@ lear@@ ly in what I like to call em@@ ph@@ atic language — language that &apos;s me@@ ant to high@@ light or under@@ line or that sp@@ r@@ ings from sur@@ pri@@ se .
"T@@ ake , for example , the word : &quot; &quot; in@@ de@@ y . &quot; &quot; Now , if there are E@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ ans in the audience , they &apos;re probably ch@@ u@@ ck@@ ling to themselves , because the word means something like &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; How could he ? &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; No , he didn &apos;t . &quot; &quot; It kind of depen@@ ds on the situ@@ ation ."
"But when I was a kid , this was my very fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te word , and I think it &apos;s because it has a pit@@ ch ."
It has a me@@ lo@@ dy .
You can almost see the sha@@ pe as it sp@@ r@@ ings from someone &apos;s m@@ outh .
"&quot; &quot; In@@ de@@ y &quot; &quot; — it di@@ ps , and then ra@@ is@@ es again ."
"And as a musi@@ ci@@ an and com@@ pos@@ er , when I hear that word , something like this is flo@@ ating through my mind ."

P@@ er@@ haps you can hear it in the words I &apos;m spe@@ aking even now .
"F@@ in@@ ally , we go to the 19@@ 5@@ 0s United States and the most se@@ min@@ al work of 20@@ th century av@@ an@@ t-@@ gar@@ de com@@ posi@@ tion : Joh@@ n C@@ age &apos;s &quot; &quot; 4 : 3@@ 3 , &quot; &quot; wri@@ t@@ ten for any instru@@ ment or com@@ bin@@ ation of instru@@ ments ."

"In 20@@ 11 , during the fin@@ al six months of K@@ im J@@ on@@ g@@ -@@ I@@ l &apos;s life , I li@@ ved under@@ co@@ ver in Nor@@ th Kore@@ a ."

"The students were 2@@ 70 young men , expe@@ cted to be the future le@@ ad@@ ers of the most is@@ ol@@ ated and bru@@ tal di@@ ct@@ at@@ or@@ ship in ex@@ ist@@ ence ."

My students were the only ones sp@@ ared from that f@@ ate .

E@@ very@@ thing there is about the Gre@@ at Le@@ a@@ der .
"E@@ very book , every ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er arti@@ cle , every s@@ ong , every T@@ V program — there is just one sub@@ je@@ ct ."
"The f@@ low@@ ers are na@@ med after him , the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins are car@@ ved with his s@@ log@@ ans ."
E@@ very ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en we@@ ars the bad@@ ge of the Gre@@ at Le@@ a@@ der at all times .

"The school was a he@@ avi@@ ly gu@@ ar@@ ded pri@@ son , pos@@ ing as a cam@@ pu@@ s ."
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers could only leave on group out@@ ings ac@@ comp@@ an@@ ied by an offi@@ cial min@@ der .

"E@@ very bl@@ ank space was co@@ vered with the por@@ tra@@ its of K@@ im I@@ l-@@ S@@ ung and K@@ im J@@ on@@ g@@ -@@ I@@ l , like every@@ where else in Nor@@ th Kore@@ a ."
We were never allow@@ ed to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s the outside world .
"As students of science and technology , many of them were computer maj@@ ors but they did not know the ex@@ ist@@ ence of the Inter@@ net ."
They had never heard of Mar@@ k Z@@ u@@ ck@@ er@@ ber@@ g or Ste@@ ve J@@ ob@@ s .
And I could not tell them .
I went there looking for tru@@ th .
"But where do you even start when an entire n@@ ation &apos;s ide@@ o@@ logy , my students &apos; da@@ y@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day reali@@ ties , and even my own posi@@ tion at the uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties , were all built on l@@ ies ?"
I started with a g@@ ame .
"We pla@@ yed &quot; &quot; T@@ ru@@ th and L@@ ie . &quot; &quot; A vol@@ un@@ te@@ er would write a s@@ ent@@ ence on the chal@@ k@@ bo@@ ard , and the other students had to gu@@ ess whether it was a tru@@ th or a lie ."

V@@ ir@@ tually no Nor@@ th Kore@@ an is allow@@ ed to leave the country .
E@@ ven tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing within their own country requi@@ res a tra@@ vel pas@@ s .
"I had hop@@ ed that this g@@ ame would re@@ ve@@ al some tru@@ th about my students , because they lie so often and so e@@ a@@ si@@ ly , whether about the my@@ thi@@ cal ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments of their Gre@@ at Le@@ a@@ der , or the str@@ ange c@@ la@@ im that they c@@ lon@@ ed a ra@@ b@@ bit as fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ ders ."
The difference between tru@@ th and l@@ ies seem@@ ed at times ha@@ zy to them .
"It took me a while to understand the different typ@@ es of l@@ ies ; they lie to sh@@ ie@@ ld their system from the world , or they were t@@ au@@ ght l@@ ies , and were just re@@ g@@ ur@@ gi@@ t@@ ating them ."
"O@@ r , at mom@@ ents , they lie@@ d out of ha@@ bit ."
"But if all they have ever known were l@@ ies , how could we expe@@ ct them to be o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se ?"
"N@@ ex@@ t , I tr@@ ied to te@@ ach them es@@ say writing ."
But that turned out to be ne@@ ar@@ ly im@@ possible .
"E@@ s@@ says are about coming up with one &apos;s own the@@ sis , and making an evi@@ den@@ ce@@ -@@ based ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent to pro@@ ve it ."
"These students , h@@ ow@@ ever , were simply told what to think , and they obe@@ yed ."
"In their world , cri@@ tical thinking was not allow@@ ed ."
"I also gave them the we@@ ek@@ ly as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment of writing a per@@ s@@ onal let@@ ter , to any@@ body ."
"It took a long time , but ev@@ en@@ tually some of them began to write to their mo@@ thers , their friends , their gir@@ l@@ friends ."
"A@@ l@@ though those were just h@@ ome@@ work , and would never re@@ ach their inten@@ ded re@@ ci@@ pie@@ n@@ ts , my students s@@ low@@ ly began to re@@ ve@@ al their true feel@@ ings in them ."
They wro@@ te that they were f@@ ed up with the sam@@ en@@ ess of everything .
They were wor@@ ried about their future .
"In those let@@ ters , they r@@ are@@ ly ever men@@ tion@@ ed their Gre@@ at Le@@ a@@ der ."
I was sp@@ ending all of my time with these young men .
"We all ate me@@ als together , pla@@ yed bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball together ."
"I often called them g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , which made them gi@@ gg@@ le ."
They bl@@ us@@ h@@ ed at the men@@ tion of girls .
And I came to ad@@ ore them .
"And wat@@ ching them open up even in the t@@ in@@ ie@@ st of ways , was de@@ e@@ ply moving ."
But something also felt wrong .
"D@@ ur@@ ing those months of living in their world , I often wonder@@ ed if the tru@@ th would , in fact , impro@@ ve their lives ."
"I wanted so much to tell them the tru@@ th , of their country and of the outside world , where A@@ ra@@ b y@@ outh were tur@@ ning their ro@@ t@@ ten regi@@ me inside out , using the power of social media , where everyone ex@@ cept them was conne@@ cted through the world wi@@ de we@@ b , which wasn &apos;t wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de after all ."
"But for them , the tru@@ th was d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ."
"B@@ y en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing them to run after it , I was pu@@ tting them at ri@@ sk — of per@@ secu@@ tion , of hear@@ t@@ bre@@ ak ."
"When you &apos;re not allow@@ ed to ex@@ pre@@ ss anything in the open , you become good at re@@ ading what is un@@ spo@@ k@@ en ."
"In one of their per@@ s@@ onal let@@ ters to me , a stud@@ ent wro@@ te that he under@@ sto@@ od why I always called them g@@ ent@@ le@@ men ."
"It was because I was wi@@ sh@@ ing them to be g@@ ent@@ le in life , he said ."
"O@@ n my last day in De@@ c@@ em@@ ber of 20@@ 11 , the day K@@ im J@@ on@@ g@@ -@@ I@@ l &apos;s death was an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced , their world sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed ."
I had to leave without a pro@@ per go@@ od@@ by@@ e .
But I think they knew how sa@@ d I was for them .
"O@@ n@@ ce , tow@@ ard the end of my st@@ ay , a stud@@ ent said to me , &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or , we never think of you as being different from us ."
"O@@ ur cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces are different , but you &apos;re the same as us ."
"We want you to know that we tru@@ ly think of you as being the same . &quot; &quot; T@@ od@@ ay , if I could re@@ spo@@ nd to my students with a let@@ ter of my own , which is of course im@@ possible , I would tell them this : &quot; &quot; My de@@ ar g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , It &apos;s been a bit over three years since I last saw you ."
"And now , you must be 2@@ 2 — maybe even as old as 2@@ 3 ."
"A@@ t our fin@@ al clas@@ s , I asked you if there was anything you wanted ."
"The only wi@@ sh you ex@@ pres@@ sed , the only thing you ever asked of me in all those months we spent together , was for me to speak to you in Kore@@ an ."
J@@ ust once .
I was there to te@@ ach you En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ; you knew it wasn &apos;t allow@@ ed .
"But I under@@ sto@@ od then , you wanted to share that b@@ ond of our mother ton@@ gu@@ e ."
"I called you my g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , but I don &apos;t know if being g@@ ent@@ le in K@@ im J@@ on@@ g@@ -@@ U@@ n &apos;s mer@@ ci@@ less Nor@@ th Kore@@ a is a good thing ."
I don &apos;t want you to le@@ ad a re@@ v@@ olution — let some other young person do it .
"The rest of the world might c@@ as@@ u@@ ally en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge or even expe@@ ct some sort of Nor@@ th Kore@@ an S@@ pr@@ ing , but I don &apos;t want you to do anything ri@@ sk@@ y , because I know in your world , someone is always wat@@ ching ."
I don &apos;t want to imagine what might happen to you .
"If my at@@ tem@@ p@@ ts to re@@ ach you have inspi@@ red something new in you , I would rather you for@@ get me ."
"Be@@ come sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s of your Gre@@ at Le@@ a@@ der , and live long , sa@@ fe lives ."
"You once asked me if I thought your city of P@@ y@@ on@@ g@@ y@@ an@@ g was beautiful , and I could not answer tru@@ th@@ fully then ."
But I know why you asked .
"I know that it was important for you to hear that I , your teach@@ er , the one who has seen the world that you are for@@ bi@@ d@@ den from , dec@@ l@@ are your city as the most beautiful ."
"I know hear@@ ing that would make your lives there a bit more be@@ ar@@ able , but no , I don &apos;t find your ca@@ pi@@ tal beautiful ."
"N@@ ot because it &apos;s mon@@ ot@@ one and con@@ cre@@ te , but because of what it sym@@ bo@@ liz@@ es : a mon@@ ster that fe@@ eds off the rest of the country , where ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens are sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s and s@@ la@@ ves ."
All I see there is dar@@ k@@ ness .
"But it &apos;s your home , so I cannot h@@ ate it ."
"And I hope instead that you , my lo@@ vely young g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , will one day help make it beautiful ."

"In 19@@ 18 , a new vi@@ ru@@ s ap@@ pe@@ ared that kil@@ led some 50 to 100 million people ."

They basically create a c@@ ac@@ he of we@@ apo@@ ns for your im@@ mu@@ ne system which you can de@@ plo@@ y when needed .
"Now , when you get a vi@@ ral in@@ fe@@ ction , what nor@@ m@@ ally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fi@@ ght back at full str@@ eng@@ th , and that might be too l@@ ate ."
"When you &apos;re pre@@ -@@ im@@ muni@@ zed , what happens is you have for@@ ces in your body pre@@ -@@ tra@@ ined to re@@ cogni@@ ze and de@@ fe@@ at speci@@ fic fo@@ es ."
So that &apos;s really how vac@@ cin@@ es work .
"Now , let &apos;s take a look at a video that we &apos;re de@@ bu@@ ting at TED , for the first time , on how an effe@@ ctive HIV vac@@ cine might work ."
( Music ) N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : A vac@@ cine tra@@ ins the body in adv@@ ance how to re@@ cogni@@ ze and neu@@ tr@@ ali@@ ze a speci@@ fic inv@@ a@@ der .
"A@@ f@@ ter HIV pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ates the body &apos;s mu@@ co@@ s@@ al bar@@ r@@ ier@@ s , it in@@ fe@@ cts im@@ mu@@ ne cells to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate ."
The inv@@ a@@ der d@@ raw@@ s the at@@ ten@@ tion of the im@@ mu@@ ne system &apos;s fron@@ t-@@ line tro@@ op@@ s .
"D@@ en@@ dri@@ tic cells , or m@@ ac@@ rop@@ ha@@ ges , cap@@ ture the vi@@ ru@@ s and disp@@ l@@ ay pie@@ ces of it ."
Me@@ mor@@ y cells gener@@ ated by the HIV vac@@ cine are acti@@ v@@ ated when they learn HIV is present from the fron@@ t-@@ line tro@@ op@@ s .
These memor@@ y cells im@@ medi@@ ately de@@ plo@@ y the ex@@ act we@@ apo@@ ns needed .
"M@@ e@@ mor@@ y B cells turn into pl@@ as@@ ma cells , which produ@@ ce wa@@ ve after wa@@ ve of the speci@@ fic anti@@ bod@@ ies that lat@@ ch on@@ to HIV to pre@@ v@@ ent it from in@@ fe@@ cting cells , while squ@@ ad@@ ron@@ s of kil@@ ler T cells se@@ ek out and de@@ stro@@ y cells that are already HIV in@@ fe@@ cted ."
The vi@@ ru@@ s is de@@ fe@@ ated .
"Wi@@ th@@ out a vac@@ cine , these respon@@ ses would have taken more than a week ."
"B@@ y that time , the bat@@ tle against HIV would already have been lost ."
"S@@ e@@ th B@@ er@@ k@@ ley : Re@@ ally cool video , isn &apos;t it ?"
"The anti@@ bod@@ ies you just saw in this video , in action , are the ones that make most vac@@ cin@@ es work ."
So the real question then is : How do we en@@ sure that your body makes the ex@@ act ones that we need to prote@@ ct against f@@ lu and HIV ?
The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al challen@@ ge for both of these vi@@ rus@@ es is that they &apos;re always chang@@ ing .
So let &apos;s take a look at the f@@ lu vi@@ ru@@ s .
"In this ren@@ der@@ ing of the f@@ lu vi@@ ru@@ s , these different co@@ lo@@ red spi@@ k@@ es are what it uses to in@@ fe@@ ct you ."
"And also , what the anti@@ bod@@ ies use is a hand@@ le to essen@@ ti@@ ally gra@@ b and neu@@ tr@@ ali@@ ze the vi@@ ru@@ s ."
"When these mu@@ t@@ ate , they change their sha@@ pe , and the anti@@ bod@@ ies don &apos;t know what they &apos;re looking at any@@ more ."
So that &apos;s why every year you can cat@@ ch a sli@@ gh@@ tly different stra@@ in of f@@ lu .
"It &apos;s also why in the sp@@ ring , we have to make a best gu@@ ess at which three stra@@ ins are going to pre@@ v@@ a@@ il the next year , put those into a single vac@@ cine and rus@@ h those into produ@@ ction for the f@@ all ."
"E@@ ven wor@@ se , the most common in@@ flu@@ en@@ za — in@@ flu@@ en@@ za A — also in@@ fe@@ cts animals that live in close pro@@ x@@ imi@@ ty to hum@@ ans , and they can re@@ com@@ b@@ ine in those particular animals ."
"In ad@@ di@@ tion , wi@@ ld a@@ qu@@ atic bir@@ ds car@@ ry all known stra@@ ins of in@@ flu@@ en@@ za ."
"So , you &apos;ve got this situ@@ ation : In 200@@ 3 , we had an H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 vi@@ ru@@ s that j@@ um@@ ped from bir@@ ds into hum@@ ans in a few is@@ ol@@ ated c@@ ases with an ap@@ par@@ ent mor@@ t@@ ality r@@ ate of 70 percent ."
"Now lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly , that particular vi@@ ru@@ s , al@@ though very sc@@ ary at the time , did not trans@@ m@@ it from person to person very e@@ a@@ si@@ ly ."
"This year &apos;s H@@ 1@@ N@@ 1 thre@@ at was actually a human , avi@@ an , s@@ w@@ ine mi@@ x@@ ture that aro@@ se in M@@ exi@@ co ."
"It was e@@ a@@ si@@ ly trans@@ mi@@ t@@ ted , but , lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly , was pretty mi@@ ld ."
"And so , in a sense , our lu@@ ck is hol@@ ding out , but you know , another wi@@ ld bir@@ d could f@@ ly over at any@@ time ."
Now let &apos;s take a look at HIV .
"As v@@ ari@@ able as f@@ lu is , HIV makes f@@ lu look like the Ro@@ ck of G@@ i@@ br@@ al@@ t@@ ar ."
The vi@@ ru@@ s that ca@@ uses AIDS is the tri@@ c@@ kie@@ st pa@@ th@@ og@@ en scienti@@ sts have ever con@@ fron@@ ted .
"It mu@@ t@@ ates fu@@ ri@@ ously , it has de@@ co@@ ys to ev@@ ade the im@@ mu@@ ne system , it att@@ ac@@ ks the very cells that are trying to fi@@ ght it and it quickly hi@@ des itself in your gen@@ ome ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s a sli@@ de looking at the gen@@ e@@ tic v@@ ari@@ ation of f@@ lu and com@@ par@@ ing that to HIV , a much wil@@ der tar@@ get ."
"In the video a moment ago , you saw f@@ le@@ ets of new vi@@ rus@@ es la@@ un@@ ching from in@@ fe@@ cted cells ."
"Now realize that in a re@@ cent@@ ly in@@ fe@@ cted person , there are mi@@ llions of these ships ; each one is just sli@@ gh@@ tly different ."
F@@ in@@ ding a we@@ apo@@ n that re@@ cogni@@ z@@ es and sin@@ ks all of them makes the job that much har@@ der .
"Now , in the 2@@ 7 years since HIV was iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ied as the cause of AIDS , we &apos;ve develo@@ ped more dru@@ gs to tre@@ at HIV than all other vi@@ rus@@ es put together ."
"These dru@@ gs ar@@ en &apos;t cu@@ res , but they re@@ present a huge tri@@ um@@ ph of science because they take away the au@@ tom@@ atic death s@@ ent@@ ence from a di@@ ag@@ no@@ sis of HIV , at least for those who can ac@@ cess them ."
The vac@@ cine ef@@ for@@ t though is really quite different .
L@@ ar@@ ge comp@@ an@@ ies mo@@ ved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vac@@ cin@@ es were seen as po@@ or business .
"M@@ any thought that it was just im@@ possible to make an AIDS vac@@ cine , but today , evi@@ dence tel@@ ls us o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se ."
"In Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber , we had sur@@ pri@@ sing but exci@@ ting fin@@ dings from a c@@ lini@@ cal tri@@ al that took place in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and ."
"For the first time , we saw an AIDS vac@@ cine work in hum@@ ans — al@@ be@@ it , quite mode@@ st@@ ly — and that particular vac@@ cine was made almost a dec@@ ade ago ."
N@@ ew@@ er con@@ cep@@ ts and early test@@ ing now show even gre@@ ater pro@@ mi@@ se in the best of our ani@@ mal mode@@ ls .
"But in the past few months , resear@@ ch@@ ers have also is@@ ol@@ ated se@@ ver@@ al new bro@@ ad@@ ly neu@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ing anti@@ bod@@ ies from the blo@@ od of an HIV in@@ fe@@ cted individu@@ al ."
"Now , what does this mean ?"
"We saw ear@@ lie@@ r that HIV is high@@ ly v@@ ari@@ able , that a bro@@ ad neu@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ing anti@@ body lat@@ ch@@ es on and dis@@ ab@@ les mul@@ ti@@ ple v@@ ari@@ ations of the vi@@ ru@@ s ."
"If you take these and you put them in the best of our mon@@ key mode@@ ls , they provi@@ de full prote@@ ction from in@@ fe@@ ction ."
"In ad@@ di@@ tion , these resear@@ ch@@ ers found a new site on HIV where the anti@@ bod@@ ies can gra@@ b on@@ to , and what &apos;s so spe@@ cial about this spo@@ t is that it chang@@ es very little as the vi@@ ru@@ s mu@@ t@@ ates ."
"It &apos;s like , as many times as the vi@@ ru@@ s chang@@ es its clo@@ the@@ s , it &apos;s still we@@ aring the same so@@ cks , and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really h@@ ate those so@@ cks ."
So what we &apos;ve got is a situ@@ ation .
"The T@@ ha@@ i resul@@ ts tell us we can make an AIDS vac@@ cine , and the anti@@ body fin@@ dings tell us how we might do that ."
"This strate@@ gy , working back@@ war@@ ds from an anti@@ body to create a vac@@ cine can@@ di@@ d@@ ate , has never been done before in vac@@ cine research ."
"It &apos;s called re@@ tro@@ -@@ vac@@ cin@@ o@@ logy , and its im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations ex@@ ten@@ d way be@@ y@@ ond that of just HIV ."
So think of it this way .
"We &apos;ve got these new anti@@ bod@@ ies we &apos;ve iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ied , and we know that they lat@@ ch on@@ to many , many v@@ ari@@ ations of the vi@@ ru@@ s ."
"We know that they have to lat@@ ch on@@ to a speci@@ fic part , so if we can figure out the pre@@ ci@@ se structure of that part , present that through a vac@@ cine , what we hope is we can pro@@ m@@ pt your im@@ mu@@ ne system to make these mat@@ ching anti@@ bod@@ ies ."
And that would create a uni@@ vers@@ al HIV vac@@ cine .
"Now , it sounds e@@ as@@ ier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue anti@@ body di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m att@@ ach@@ ed to its y@@ el@@ low bin@@ ding site , and as you can imagine , these thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal stru@@ ctures are much har@@ der to work on ."
"And if you guys have ideas to help us sol@@ ve this , we &apos;d love to hear about it ."
"But , you know , the research that has oc@@ cur@@ red from HIV now has really hel@@ ped with in@@ no@@ vation with other dise@@ ases ."
"So for in@@ stance , a bi@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy company has now found bro@@ ad@@ ly neu@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ing anti@@ bod@@ ies to in@@ flu@@ en@@ za , as well as a new anti@@ body tar@@ get on the f@@ lu vi@@ ru@@ s ."
"They &apos;re cur@@ r@@ ently making a co@@ c@@ kt@@ a@@ il — an anti@@ body co@@ c@@ kt@@ a@@ il — that can be used to tre@@ at se@@ v@@ ere , over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming c@@ ases of f@@ lu ."
"In the longer ter@@ m , what they can do is use these to@@ ols of re@@ tro@@ -@@ vac@@ cin@@ o@@ logy to make a pre@@ v@@ enti@@ ve f@@ lu vac@@ cine ."
"Now , re@@ tro@@ -@@ vac@@ cin@@ o@@ logy is just one techni@@ qu@@ e within the am@@ bit of so@@ -@@ called r@@ ational vac@@ cine design ."
Let me give you another example .
We tal@@ ked about before the H and N spi@@ k@@ es on the surface of the f@@ lu vi@@ ru@@ s .
"N@@ oti@@ ce these other , s@@ mal@@ ler pro@@ tu@@ ber@@ an@@ ces ."
These are lar@@ ge@@ ly hi@@ d@@ den from the im@@ mu@@ ne system .
Now it turns out that these spo@@ ts also don &apos;t change much when the vi@@ ru@@ s mu@@ t@@ ates .
"If you can cri@@ pp@@ le these with speci@@ fic anti@@ bod@@ ies , you could cri@@ pp@@ le all ver@@ sions of the f@@ lu ."
"So far , ani@@ mal te@@ sts indi@@ cate that such a vac@@ cine could pre@@ v@@ ent se@@ v@@ ere dise@@ ase , al@@ though you might get a mi@@ ld case ."
"So if this works in hum@@ ans , what we &apos;re talking about is a uni@@ vers@@ al f@@ lu vac@@ cine , one that doesn &apos;t need to change every year and would re@@ move the thre@@ at of death ."
"We really could think of f@@ lu , then , as just a bad c@@ old ."
"O@@ f course , the best vac@@ cine imag@@ in@@ able is only val@@ u@@ able to the ex@@ t@@ ent we get it to everyone who needs it ."
"So to do that , we have to com@@ b@@ ine s@@ mar@@ t vac@@ cine design with s@@ mar@@ t produ@@ ction meth@@ ods and , of course , s@@ mar@@ t deli@@ very meth@@ ods ."
So I want you to think back a few months ago .
"In Ju@@ ne , the World H@@ e@@ alth O@@ r@@ gani@@ z@@ ation dec@@ lar@@ ed the first global f@@ lu pan@@ demi@@ c in 4@@ 1 years ."
The U.@@ S. government pro@@ mis@@ ed 1@@ 50 million do@@ ses of vac@@ cine by O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 1@@ 5@@ th for the f@@ lu pe@@ ak .
V@@ ac@@ cin@@ es were pro@@ mis@@ ed to develo@@ ping countries .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of mi@@ llions of dollars were spent and f@@ low@@ ed to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating vac@@ cine man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing .
So what happened ?
"Well , we first figu@@ red out how to make f@@ lu vac@@ cin@@ es , how to produ@@ ce them , in the early 19@@ 4@@ 0s ."
"It was a s@@ low , cu@@ m@@ ber@@ some process that depen@@ ded on chi@@ ck@@ en e@@ g@@ gs , mi@@ llions of living chi@@ ck@@ en e@@ g@@ gs ."
"@@ V@@ ir@@ uses only gro@@ w in living things , and so it turned out that , for f@@ lu , chi@@ ck@@ en e@@ g@@ gs worked really well ."
"For most stra@@ ins , you could get one to two do@@ ses of vac@@ cine per e@@ g@@ g ."
"Lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly for us , we live in an era of bre@@ a@@ th@@ taking bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal adv@@ an@@ ces ."
"So today , we get our f@@ lu vac@@ cin@@ es from ..."
"@@ chi@@ ck@@ en e@@ g@@ gs , ( Laughter ) hundre@@ ds of mi@@ llions of chi@@ ck@@ en e@@ g@@ gs ."
Al@@ most nothing has changed .
The system is reli@@ able but the problem is you never know how well a stra@@ in is going to gro@@ w .
This year &apos;s s@@ w@@ ine f@@ lu stra@@ in gre@@ w very po@@ or@@ ly in early produ@@ ction : basically .@@ 6 do@@ ses per e@@ g@@ g .
"So , here &apos;s an al@@ ar@@ ming thought ."
What if that wi@@ ld bir@@ d fl@@ ies by again ?
"You could see an avi@@ an stra@@ in that would in@@ fe@@ ct the po@@ ul@@ try flo@@ cks , and then we would have no e@@ g@@ gs for our vac@@ cin@@ es ."
"So , D@@ an &#91; Bar@@ ber &#93; , if you want bi@@ llions of chi@@ ck@@ en pe@@ l@@ le@@ ts for your fish far@@ m , I know where to get them ."
"So right now , the world can produ@@ ce about 3@@ 50 million do@@ ses of f@@ lu vac@@ cine for the three stra@@ ins , and we can up that to about 1@@ .@@ 2 billion do@@ ses if we want to tar@@ get a single v@@ ari@@ ant like s@@ w@@ ine f@@ lu ."
"But this as@@ su@@ mes that our fac@@ tor@@ ies are hum@@ ming because , in 200@@ 4 , the U.@@ S. su@@ pp@@ ly was cut in half by cont@@ am@@ in@@ ation at one single pl@@ ant ."
And the process still takes more than half a year .
So are we better pre@@ par@@ ed than we were in 19@@ 18 ?
"Well , with the new technolog@@ ies em@@ er@@ g@@ ing now , I hope we can say defini@@ ti@@ vely , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I@@ mag@@ ine we could produ@@ ce enough f@@ lu vac@@ cine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we &apos;re cur@@ r@@ ently sp@@ ending now in the United States ."
"Wi@@ th a r@@ ange of new technolog@@ ies , we could ."
Here &apos;s an example : A company I &apos;m eng@@ aged with has found a speci@@ fic piece of the H spi@@ ke of f@@ lu that sp@@ ar@@ ks the im@@ mu@@ ne system .
"If you lo@@ p this off and att@@ ach it to the ta@@ il of a different bac@@ ter@@ i@@ um , which cre@@ ates a vi@@ go@@ rou@@ s im@@ mu@@ ne respon@@ se , they &apos;ve created a very powerful f@@ lu fi@@ gh@@ ter ."
"This vac@@ cine is so small it can be grow@@ n in a common bac@@ ter@@ ia , E@@ . col@@ i ."
"Now , as you know , bac@@ ter@@ ia re@@ produ@@ ce quickly — it &apos;s like making y@@ og@@ ur@@ t — and so we could produ@@ ce enough s@@ w@@ ine ori@@ g@@ in f@@ lu for the entire world in a few fac@@ tor@@ ies , in a few weeks , with no e@@ g@@ gs , for a f@@ rac@@ tion of the cost of cur@@ r@@ ent meth@@ ods ."
( Applause ) So here &apos;s a com@@ par@@ is@@ on of se@@ ver@@ al of these new vac@@ cine technolog@@ ies .
"And , a@@ side from the radi@@ cally incre@@ as@@ ed produ@@ ction and huge cost sa@@ v@@ ings — for example , the E@@ . col@@ i meth@@ od I just tal@@ ked about — look at the time sa@@ ved : this would be lives sa@@ ved ."
"The develo@@ ping world , mo@@ st@@ ly left out of the cur@@ r@@ ent respon@@ se , se@@ es the poten@@ tial of these alter@@ n@@ ate technolog@@ ies and they &apos;re le@@ ap@@ fro@@ gg@@ ing the W@@ est ."
"In@@ di@@ a , M@@ exi@@ co and others are already making experim@@ ent@@ al f@@ lu vac@@ cin@@ es , and they may be the first place we see these vac@@ cin@@ es in use ."
"Because these technolog@@ ies are so ef@@ fi@@ cient and relati@@ vely che@@ a@@ p , bi@@ llions of people can have ac@@ cess to li@@ f@@ es@@ a@@ ving vac@@ cin@@ es if we can figure out how to deli@@ ver them ."
Now think of where this le@@ ads us .
New in@@ fe@@ cti@@ ous dise@@ ases ap@@ pe@@ ar or re@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar every few years .
"S@@ ome day , per@@ haps so@@ on , we &apos;ll have a vi@@ ru@@ s that is going to thre@@ at@@ en all of us ."
Wi@@ ll we be qui@@ ck enough to re@@ act before mi@@ llions die ?
"Lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly , this year &apos;s f@@ lu was relati@@ vely mi@@ ld ."
"I say , &quot; &quot; lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly &quot; &quot; in part because vi@@ r@@ tually no one in the develo@@ ping world was vac@@ cin@@ ated ."
"So if we have the poli@@ tical and fin@@ an@@ cial fore@@ si@@ ght to susta@@ in our inv@@ est@@ ments , we will ma@@ ster these and new to@@ ols of vac@@ cin@@ o@@ logy , and with these to@@ ols we can produ@@ ce enough vac@@ cine for everyone at low cost and en@@ sure health@@ y produ@@ ctive lives ."
No longer must f@@ lu have to ki@@ ll half a million people a year .
No longer does AIDS need to ki@@ ll two million a year .
"No longer do the po@@ or and v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able need to be thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by in@@ fe@@ cti@@ ous dise@@ ases , or in@@ de@@ ed , any@@ body ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad of having V@@ ac@@ la@@ v S@@ mi@@ l &apos;s &quot; &quot; mas@@ si@@ vely f@@ at@@ al dis@@ contin@@ u@@ ity &quot; &quot; of life , we can en@@ sure the contin@@ u@@ ity of life ."
"What the world needs now are these new vac@@ cin@@ es , and we can make it happen ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you .
"So , the science is chang@@ ing . In your mind , Se@@ th — I mean , you must dre@@ am about this —@@ "
"@@ what is the kind of time scale on , let &apos;s start with HIV , for a g@@ am@@ e-@@ chang@@ ing vac@@ cine that &apos;s actually out there and us@@ able ?"
"S@@ B : The g@@ ame change can come at any time , because the problem we have now is we &apos;ve sh@@ own we can get a vac@@ cine to work in hum@@ ans ; we just need a better one ."
"And with these typ@@ es of anti@@ bod@@ ies , we know hum@@ ans can make them ."
"So , if we can figure out how to do that , then we have the vac@@ cine , and what &apos;s interesting is there already is some evi@@ dence that we &apos;re beginning to c@@ rac@@ k that problem ."
"So , the challen@@ ge is full speed a@@ head ."
"CA : In your gu@@ t , do you think it &apos;s probably going to be at least another five years ?"
"S@@ B : You know , everybody says it &apos;s 10 years , but it &apos;s been 10 years every 10 years ."
"So I h@@ ate to put a ti@@ me@@ line on scienti@@ fic in@@ no@@ vation , but the inv@@ est@@ ments that have oc@@ cur@@ red are now pa@@ ying di@@ vi@@ den@@ ds ."
"CA : And that &apos;s the same with uni@@ vers@@ al f@@ lu vac@@ cine , the same kind of thing ?"
S@@ B : I think f@@ lu is different . I think what happened with f@@ lu is we &apos;ve got a bu@@ n@@ ch — I just show@@ ed some of this — a bu@@ n@@ ch of really cool and us@@ e@@ ful technolog@@ ies that are ready to go now .
"They look good . The problem has been that , what we did is we inv@@ est@@ ed in tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal technolog@@ ies because that &apos;s what we were comfor@@ table with ."
"You also can use ad@@ ju@@ v@@ an@@ ts , which are chemi@@ cal@@ s you mi@@ x ."
"That &apos;s what Europ@@ e is doing , so we could have di@@ lu@@ ted out our su@@ pp@@ ly of f@@ lu and made more available , but , going back to what Mi@@ cha@@ el S@@ pe@@ c@@ ter said , the anti@@ -@@ vac@@ cine c@@ row@@ d didn &apos;t really want that to happen ."

"I &apos;m a big belie@@ ver in the emoti@@ on of design , and the mess@@ age that &apos;s s@@ ent before somebody begin@@ s to read , before they get the rest of the information ; what is the emoti@@ onal respon@@ se they get to the produ@@ ct , to the story , to the pain@@ ting — whatever it is ."

"( Laughter ) When I first cont@@ ac@@ ted W@@ il@@ li@@ am Bu@@ r@@ rou@@ gh@@ s about being part of it , he said no ; he said he didn &apos;t believe it was the end of pr@@ int ."
"And I said , well , that &apos;s f@@ ine ; I just would love to have your in@@ put on this film and this book , and he finally ag@@ re@@ ed to it ."
"And at the end of the film , he says in this great vo@@ ice that I can &apos;t mi@@ mi@@ c but I &apos;ll kind of try , but not really , he says , &quot; &quot; I remember at@@ ten@@ ding an ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion called , &apos; P@@ h@@ otogra@@ ph@@ y : The E@@ nd of P@@ a@@ in@@ ting . &apos; &quot; &quot; And then he says , &quot; &quot; And , of course , it wasn &apos;t at all . &quot; &quot; So , ap@@ par@@ ently when photograph@@ y was perfe@@ cted , there were people going around saying , that &apos;s it : you &apos;ve just ru@@ ined pain@@ ting ."
Pe@@ ople are just going to take pi@@ ctures now .
"And of course , that wasn &apos;t the case ."
"So , this is from &quot; &quot; 2@@ nd S@@ ight , &quot; &quot; a book I did on in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion ."
"I think it &apos;s not the only in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ t in design , but possi@@ bly the most important ."
It &apos;s something everybody has .
"It &apos;s not a matter of teach@@ ing it ; in fact , most of the scho@@ ols ten@@ d to di@@ sc@@ oun@@ t in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion as an in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ t of your working process because they can &apos;t qu@@ anti@@ fy it : it &apos;s very hard to te@@ ach people the four ste@@ ps to in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive design , but we can te@@ ach you the four ste@@ ps to a nice business car@@ d or a ne@@ w@@ s@@ let@@ ter ."
So it ten@@ ds to get di@@ sc@@ oun@@ ted .
"This is a quot@@ e from Al@@ ber@@ t E@@ inste@@ in , who says , &quot; &quot; The in@@ tel@@ le@@ ct has little to do on the ro@@ ad to disco@@ very ."
"There comes a lea@@ p in con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness — call it in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion or what you will — and the solution just comes to you , and you don &apos;t know from where or why . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s kind of like when somebody says , Wh@@ o did that s@@ ong ?"
"And the more you try to think about it , the f@@ ur@@ ther the answer gets from you , and the minu@@ te you stop thinking about it , your in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion gi@@ ves you that answer , in a sense ."
I like this for a couple of reas@@ ons .
"If you &apos;ve had any design cour@@ ses , they would te@@ ach you you can &apos;t read this ."
"I think you ev@@ en@@ tually can and , more import@@ an@@ tly , I think it &apos;s true ."
&quot; D@@ on &apos;t mist@@ ake le@@ gi@@ bility for communi@@ cation . &quot;
J@@ ust because something &apos;s le@@ gi@@ ble doesn &apos;t means it communi@@ c@@ ates .
"M@@ ore import@@ an@@ tly , it doesn &apos;t mean it communi@@ c@@ ates the right thing ."
"So , what is the mess@@ age s@@ ent before somebody actually gets into the materi@@ al ?"
And I think that &apos;s sometimes an over@@ looked area .
This is working with Mar@@ sh@@ all M@@ c@@ Lu@@ h@@ an .
"I sta@@ yed and worked with his wi@@ fe and son , E@@ ri@@ c , and we came up with close to 6@@ 00 quot@@ es from Mar@@ sh@@ all that are just amazing in terms of being a@@ head of the times , pre@@ di@@ cting so much of what has happened in the ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing , tele@@ vision , media world ."
And so this book is called &quot; &quot; Pro@@ be@@ s . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s another word for quot@@ es .
"And it &apos;s — a lot of them are never — have never been publi@@ shed before , and basically , I &apos;ve inter@@ pre@@ ted the different quot@@ es ."
"So , this was the cont@@ ents p@@ age ori@@ gin@@ ally ."
"When I got done it was 5@@ 40 p@@ ages , and then the publi@@ sh@@ er , G@@ ing@@ ko P@@ re@@ ss , en@@ ded up cu@@ tting it down consi@@ der@@ ably : it &apos;s just under 4@@ 00 p@@ ages now ."
But I decided I li@@ ked this cont@@ ents p@@ age — I li@@ ked the way it looks — so I ke@@ pt it .
"( Laughter ) It now has no rele@@ v@@ ance to the book wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever , but it &apos;s a nice sp@@ read , I think , in there . ( Laughter )"
"So , a couple sp@@ re@@ ads from the book : here M@@ c@@ Lu@@ h@@ an says , &quot; The new media are not bri@@ d@@ ges between M@@ an and N@@ ature ; they are N@@ ature . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; The inv@@ en@@ tion of prin@@ ting did away with an@@ on@@ y@@ mi@@ ty , f@@ ost@@ ering ideas of liter@@ ary fam@@ e and the ha@@ bit of consi@@ der@@ ing in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al ef@@ for@@ t as pri@@ v@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ty , &quot; &quot; which had never been done before prin@@ ting ."
"&quot; &quot; When new technolog@@ ies im@@ pos@@ e themselves on socie@@ ties long ha@@ bi@@ tu@@ ated to ol@@ der technolog@@ ies , an@@ x@@ ie@@ ties of all kinds resul@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ hi@@ le people are eng@@ aged in cre@@ ating a tot@@ ally different world , they always form vi@@ vi@@ d images of the pre@@ ce@@ ding world . &quot; &quot; I h@@ ate this stuff . It &apos;s hard to read ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; Pe@@ ople in the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic age have no possible environment ex@@ cept the g@@ lo@@ be , and no possible oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ation ex@@ cept information ga@@ ther@@ ing . &quot; &quot; That was it . That &apos;s all he saw as the op@@ tions . And not too far off ."
"So , this is a project for N@@ ine In@@ ch Na@@ il@@ s ."
"And I only show it because it seem@@ ed like it got all this rele@@ v@@ an@@ cy all of a sud@@ den , and it was done right after 9 / 11 ."
And I had re@@ cent@@ ly disco@@ vered a b@@ om@@ b sh@@ el@@ ter in the back@@ y@@ ard of a house I had b@@ ou@@ ght in L@@ A that the real est@@ ate person ha@@ dn &apos;t poin@@ ted out .
"( Laughter ) There was some b@@ om@@ b sh@@ el@@ ter built , ap@@ par@@ ently in the &apos; 6@@ 0s C@@ u@@ b@@ an mis@@ si@@ le cri@@ sis ."
"And I asked the real est@@ ate guy what it was as we were wal@@ king by , and he goes , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s something to do with the se@@ wa@@ ge system . &quot; &quot; I was , O@@ .@@ K@@ . ; that &apos;s f@@ ine ."
"I finally went down there , and it was this old ru@@ st@@ ed cir@@ cular thing , and two be@@ ds , and very kind of cre@@ e@@ py and we@@ ird ."
"And also , sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly , it was done in kind of a che@@ a@@ p me@@ tal , and it had completely ru@@ st@@ ed through , and water every@@ where , and spi@@ ders ."
"And I thought , you know , what were they thinking ?"
"You &apos;d think maybe c@@ ement , possi@@ bly , or something ."
"But any@@ way , I used this for a co@@ ver for the N@@ ine In@@ ch Na@@ il@@ s D@@ V@@ D , and I &apos;ve also now fi@@ x@@ ed the b@@ om@@ b sh@@ el@@ ter with du@@ ct ta@@ pe , and it &apos;s ready . I think I &apos;m ready . So ."
"This is an experim@@ ent , really , for a cl@@ ien@@ t , Q@@ u@@ i@@ ck@@ sil@@ ver , where we were taking what was a si@@ x@@ -@@ sh@@ ot sequ@@ ence and trying to use pr@@ int as a medi@@ um to get people to the W@@ e@@ b ."
"So , this is a si@@ x@@ -@@ sh@@ ot sequ@@ ence ."
I &apos;ve taken one sh@@ ot ; I cro@@ pped it a few different ways .
"And then the t@@ iny line of cop@@ y says , If you want to see this entire sequ@@ ence — how this whole ri@@ de was — go to the we@@ b@@ site ."
And my gu@@ ess is that a lot of the sur@@ f kids did go to the site to get this entire picture .
"G@@ ot no way of trac@@ king it , so I could be tot@@ ally wrong ."
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t have the site . It &apos;s just the piece itself .
This is a group in New York called the Co@@ ali@@ tion for a S@@ mo@@ ke@@ -@@ f@@ ree En@@ viron@@ ment — asked me to do these post@@ ers .
They were wil@@ d-@@ post@@ ed around New York C@@ ity .
"You can &apos;t really — well , you can &apos;t see it at all — but the second line is really the more kind of pa@@ y@@ off , in a sense ."
"It says , &quot; &quot; If the ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te comp@@ an@@ ies can lie , then so can we . &quot; &quot; But — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) — but I did ."
"These were liter@@ ally wil@@ d-@@ post@@ ed all over New York one night , and there were defini@@ tely some he@@ ads tur@@ ning , you know , people smo@@ king and , &quot; &quot; H@@ u@@ h ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it was pur@@ pos@@ ely done to look fa@@ ir@@ ly seri@@ ous ."
"It wasn &apos;t some , you know , we@@ ird gru@@ n@@ ge ty@@ pe or something ; it looked like they might be real . An@@ y@@ way ."
"P@@ ost@@ er for At@@ lan@@ tic C@@ enter for the Ar@@ ts , a school in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da ."
This amaz@@ es me . This is a produ@@ ct I just found out .
"I was in the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an at Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , and I &apos;m just b@@ low@@ n away that in this day and age they will still se@@ ll — not that they will se@@ ll — that there is felt a need for people to li@@ gh@@ ten the color of their sk@@ in ."
"This was either an old produ@@ ct with new pac@@ k@@ ag@@ ing , or a bran@@ d-@@ new pac@@ k@@ age , and I just thought , Y@@ i@@ k@@ es ! How &apos;s that still happening ?"
"I do a lot of wor@@ k@@ sh@@ op@@ s all over the world , really , and this particular as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment was to come up with new sym@@ b@@ ols for the re@@ stro@@ om do@@ ors ."
( Laughter ) I felt this was one of the more suc@@ cess@@ ful solu@@ tions .
"The students actually cut them up and put them up around bar@@ s and re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts that night , and I just always have this vision of this el@@ der@@ ly couple going to use the re@@ stro@@ om ..."
( Laughter ) I did some work for Mi@@ cro@@ so@@ ft a few years back .
It was a wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de bran@@ ding cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
"And it was interesting to me — my back@@ ground is in so@@ ci@@ o@@ logy ; I had no design tra@@ ining , and sometimes people say , well , that expla@@ ins it — but it was a very interesting experim@@ ent because there &apos;s no produ@@ ct that I had to se@@ ll ; it was simply the image of Mi@@ cro@@ so@@ ft they were trying to impro@@ ve ."
They thought some people didn &apos;t like them .
"( Laughter ) I found out that &apos;s very true , working on this cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
"And our go@@ al was to try to hum@@ ani@@ ze them a bit , and what I did was ad@@ d ty@@ pe and people to the ad , which the pre@@ vi@@ ous cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n had not had , and no@@ body re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed them , and no@@ body re@@ fer@@ en@@ ced them ."
"And we were trying to say that , h@@ ey , some of these guys that work there are actually OK ; some of them actually have friends and family , and they &apos;re not all aw@@ ful people ."
"And the um@@ b@@ rel@@ la cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n was &quot; &quot; Thank God it &apos;s M@@ on@@ day . &quot; &quot; So , we tr@@ ied to take this — what was per@@ cei@@ ved as a neg@@ ative : their over@@ -@@ compe@@ ti@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess , their , you know , long working hours — and turn it into a posi@@ tive and not run from it ."
"You know : Thank God it &apos;s M@@ on@@ day — I get to go back to that little cu@@ bi@@ cle , those fak@@ e gra@@ y wal@@ ls , and hear everybody else &apos;s convers@@ ations f or 10 hours and then go home ."
"But any@@ way , this is one of the ads I was most ple@@ as@@ ed with , because they were all el@@ ab@@ or@@ ately ar@@ t-@@ dire@@ cted , and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer ."
"It says , &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ der A@@ round . &quot; &quot; And then it &apos;s a piece of the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are ."
And this is how the ad ran around the world .
"In G@@ er@@ many , they made one small change without che@@ c@@ king with me — no@@ r did they have to , because it was done through ag@@ en@@ cies — but see if you can tell the difference ."
This is how the ad ran throu@@ gh@@ out the world ; G@@ er@@ many made one s@@ light change in the ad .
"( Laughter ) Now , there &apos;s kind of two issu@@ es here ."
"If you &apos;re going to put a kid in the ad , pi@@ ck one that looks ali@@ ve ."
"( Laughter ) I just have a feeling this kid &apos;s been there for a week , you know ."
"He &apos;s just really hop@@ ing that bo@@ ots up and , you know ..."
"( Laughter ) And then as the ag@@ en@@ cy expla@@ ined to me , they said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , we don &apos;t have little green people in our country ; why would we put little green people in our ads , for in@@ stance ? &quot; &quot; So , I understand their logi@@ c . I tot@@ ally dis@@ ag@@ ree with it ; I think it &apos;s a very s@@ mal@@ l-@@ min@@ ded appro@@ ach , the world is cer@@ tain@@ ly much more global , and I cer@@ tain@@ ly think the people of G@@ er@@ many could have hand@@ led a little black girl sitting in front of a computer , though we &apos;ll never know ."
This is some work from R@@ ay G@@ u@@ n .
"And the point of this mag@@ az@@ ine was to read the arti@@ cles , list@@ en to the music , and try to inter@@ pre@@ t it ."
"There &apos;s no g@@ ri@@ d , there &apos;s no system , there &apos;s nothing set up in adv@@ ance ."
"This is an open@@ er for Bri@@ an E@@ no , and it &apos;s just kind of my per@@ s@@ onal inter@@ pret@@ ation of the music ."
This is ro@@ ck@@ star@@ s talking about teach@@ ers they had lu@@ st@@ ed after in school .
There &apos;s a lot of great writing in &quot; &quot; R@@ ay G@@ u@@ n . &quot; &quot; And I was for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate to find a photogra@@ ph of a teach@@ er sitting on some boo@@ ks .
( Laughter ) Ar@@ ti@@ cle on B@@ ry@@ an F@@ er@@ ry — just really bor@@ ing arti@@ cle — so I set the whole arti@@ cle in D@@ ing@@ b@@ at . ( Laughter )
You could — you could high@@ light it ; you could make it H@@ el@@ ve@@ ti@@ ca or something : it is the ac@@ tu@@ al arti@@ cle .
"I sup@@ pos@@ e you could ev@@ en@@ tually dec@@ od@@ e it , but it &apos;s really not very well wri@@ t@@ ten ; it really wouldn &apos;t be wor@@ th@@ while ."
"( Laughter ) Ha@@ ving done a lot of mag@@ az@@ ines , I &apos;m very cu@@ ri@@ ous how big mag@@ az@@ ines hand@@ le big stories , and I was very cu@@ ri@@ ous to see how Ti@@ me and N@@ ew@@ s@@ week would hand@@ le 9 / 11 ."
"And I was basically pretty disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ted to see that they had cho@@ s@@ en to show the ph@@ oto we &apos;d already seen a million times , which was basically the moment of impac@@ t ."
"And Pe@@ ople mag@@ az@@ ine , I thought , got probably the best sh@@ ot ."
"It &apos;s kind of hor@@ se@@ y ty@@ pe , but the te@@ x@@ ture — the second pl@@ ane not quite hi@@ tting : there was something more enti@@ cing , if that &apos;s the right — it &apos;s not the right word — but in this co@@ ver than Ti@@ me or N@@ ew@@ s@@ week ."
"But when I got into this mag@@ az@@ ine , there &apos;s something kind of di@@ st@@ urb@@ ing , and this contin@@ u@@ ed ."
O@@ n the left we see people dy@@ ing ; we see people ru@@ n@@ ning for their lives .
And on the right we learn that there &apos;s a new way to sup@@ port your bre@@ ast .
The co@@ ve@@ ted ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand p@@ age was not given up to the whole issue .
"L@@ ook at the image of this l@@ ady — who know@@ s what she &apos;s going through ? — and the cop@@ y says : &quot; &quot; He know@@ s just how to give me go@@ o@@ se@@ bu@@ m@@ ps . &quot; &quot; Yeah , he j@@ um@@ ps out of buil@@ dings . It &apos;s — un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , this one works , kind of , as a sp@@ read ."
And this contin@@ u@@ ed through the entire mag@@ az@@ ine .
It did not let up .
This says : &quot; &quot; One cle@@ an fi@@ ts all . &quot; &quot; .
"There were a lot of or@@ ph@@ ans made this day , and here &apos;s a de@@ ad body being brought out ."
It just seem@@ s to me possi@@ bly even a bl@@ ank p@@ age would have been more appro@@ pri@@ ate .
"And this one I think is possi@@ bly the wor@@ st : two l@@ ad@@ ies , both fac@@ ing the same way , both we@@ aring je@@ ans ."
One — who know@@ s what she &apos;s going through ; the other one is wor@@ ried about model behavi@@ or and mi@@ l@@ k .
"And — I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this , and af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds somebody came up to me and they said that — they actually e@@ ma@@ i@@ led me — and they said that they ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated the talk , and when they got back to their car , they found a not@@ e on their car that made them think maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this ev@@ ent — it had been a few months ."
This was what they found on their car .
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s very few times you &apos;d be happy to find this on your car , but it did se@@ em to indi@@ cate that we were coming back ."
This is my des@@ kt@@ o@@ p .
"S@@ ome@@ body told me today there was this thing called fol@@ ders , but I don &apos;t know what they are ."
These are my not@@ es for the talk — there might be a cor@@ rel@@ ation here .
We are w@@ ra@@ pping up .
"This I saw on the pl@@ ane , fl@@ ying in , for ho@@ t new produ@@ cts ."
"I &apos;m not sure this is an impro@@ v@@ ement , or a good idea , because , like , if you don &apos;t spend quite enough time in front of your computer , you can now get a pl@@ ate in the ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard , so there &apos;s no more fak@@ ing it — that you don &apos;t really si@@ t at your des@@ k all day and e@@ at and work any@@ way ."
"Now there &apos;s a pl@@ ate , and it would be really , really con@@ ven@@ ien@@ t to get a piece of pi@@ z@@ za , then ty@@ pe a little bit , then ..."
I &apos;m just not sure this is impro@@ v@@ ement .
"If you ever d@@ ou@@ b@@ t the power of gra@@ phi@@ c design , this is a very gen@@ eri@@ c sig@@ n that liter@@ ally says , &quot; &quot; V@@ ot@@ e for H@@ it@@ ler . &quot; &quot; It says nothing else ."
"And this to me is an extre@@ me case of the power of emoti@@ on , of gra@@ phi@@ c design , even though , in fact , was a very gen@@ eri@@ c post@@ er at the time ."
What &apos;s next ? What &apos;s next is going to be people .
"As we get more techni@@ cally dri@@ ven , the import@@ ance of people be@@ comes more than it &apos;s ever been before ."
You have to u@@ ti@@ li@@ ze who you are in your work .
"N@@ ob@@ ody else can do that : no@@ body else can pu@@ ll from your back@@ ground , from your parents , your up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing , your whole life experience ."
"If you al@@ low that to happen , it &apos;s really the only way you can do some uni@@ qu@@ e work , and you &apos;re going to en@@ jo@@ y the work a lot more as well ."
"This is — I like found art ; hand let@@ ter@@ ing &apos;s coming back in a big way , and I thought this was a great example of both ."
This l@@ ady &apos;s ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing for her lost p@@ it bu@@ ll .
It &apos;s frien@@ d@@ ly — she &apos;s under@@ lin@@ ed frien@@ d@@ ly — that &apos;s probably why she cal@@ ls it H@@ er@@ cu@@ les or H@@ er@@ cles . She can &apos;t spe@@ ll .
"( Laughter ) But more import@@ an@@ tly , she &apos;s wil@@ ling to give you 20 bu@@ cks to go find this lost p@@ it bu@@ ll ."
"And I &apos;m thinking , ye@@ ah , right , I &apos;ll go look for a lost p@@ it bi@@ ll for 20 bu@@ cks ."
"I have vi@@ sions of people going down al@@ le@@ y@@ ways y@@ el@@ ling out for H@@ er@@ cles , and you get char@@ g@@ ed by this thing and you go , oh , ple@@ ase be H@@ er@@ cles ; ple@@ ase be the frien@@ d@@ ly one ."
"( Laughter ) I &apos;m sure she never found the do@@ g , because I took the sig@@ n . ( Laughter )"
But I was asked to give a talk at a con@@ fer@@ ence in S@@ ac@@ ra@@ men@@ to a few years back .
"And the the@@ me was cou@@ ra@@ ge , and they asked me to talk about how cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous it is to be a gra@@ phi@@ c desig@@ ner ."
"And I re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed seeing this photogra@@ ph of my father , who was a test pi@@ lot , and he told me that when you sig@@ ned up to become a test pi@@ lot , they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent ch@@ ance of death on the job ."
That &apos;s pretty high for most oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ations .
"( Laughter ) But , you know , the government would make a pl@@ ane ; they &apos;d say , go see if that one fl@@ ies , would you ?"
S@@ ome of them did ; some of them didn &apos;t .
"And I started thinking about some of these deci@@ sions I have to make between , like , ser@@ if ver@@ su@@ s s@@ an@@ -@@ ser@@ if ."
"( Laughter ) And for the most part , they &apos;re not real li@@ fe@@ -@@ thre@@ at@@ ening ."
Why not experim@@ ent ? Why not have some fun ?
Why not put some of yourself into the work ?
"And when I was teach@@ ing , I used to always ask the students , What &apos;s the defini@@ tion of a good job ?"
"And as teach@@ ers , after you get all the ans@@ w@@ ers , you like to give them the cor@@ re@@ ct answer ."
And the best one I &apos;ve heard — I &apos;m sure some of you have heard this — the defini@@ tion of a good job is : If you could af@@ for@@ d to — if money wasn &apos;t an issue — would you be doing that same work ?
"And if you would , you &apos;ve got a great job ."
"And if you wouldn &apos;t , what the he@@ ck are you doing ?"
You &apos;re going to be de@@ ad a really long time .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;ll just take you to B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h for a minu@@ te .
"Be@@ fore I tell that story , we should ask ourselves the question : Why does po@@ ver@@ ty exi@@ st ?"
"I mean , there is pl@@ en@@ ty of know@@ le@@ dge and scienti@@ fic bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s ."
"We all live in the same planet , but there &apos;s still a great deal of po@@ ver@@ ty in the world ."
"And I think — so I want to th@@ row a perspe@@ ctive that I have , so that we can as@@ s@@ ess this project , or any other project , for that matter , to see whether it &apos;s con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ting or — con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ting to po@@ ver@@ ty or trying to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate it ."
R@@ ich countries have been sen@@ ding a@@ id to po@@ or countries for the last 60 years .
"And by and large , this has fai@@ led ."
"And you can see this book , wri@@ t@@ ten by someone who worked in the World B@@ ank for 20 years , and he fin@@ ds economic grow@@ th in this country to be e@@ lu@@ sive ."
"B@@ y and large , it did not work ."
"So the question is , why is that ?"
"In my mind , there is something to learn from the history of Europ@@ e ."
"I mean , even here , y@@ est@@ er@@ day I was wal@@ king across the stre@@ et , and they show@@ ed three bi@@ sh@@ op@@ s were ex@@ e@@ cu@@ ted 500 years ago , right across the stre@@ et from here ."
"So my point is , there &apos;s a lot of stru@@ gg@@ le has gone in Europ@@ e , where ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens were em@@ power@@ ed by technolog@@ ies ."
And they de@@ man@@ ded au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ies from — to come down from their high hor@@ ses .
"And in the end , there &apos;s better bar@@ ga@@ ining between the au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ies and ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , and de@@ moc@@ rac@@ ies , ca@@ pit@@ ali@@ sm — everything else fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shed ."
"And so you can see , the real process of — and this is bac@@ ked up by this 5@@ 0@@ 0-@@ p@@ age book — that the au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ies came down and ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens got up ."
"But if you look , if you have that perspe@@ ctive , then you can see what happened in the last 60 years ."
A@@ id actually did the op@@ posi@@ te .
"It em@@ power@@ ed au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ies , and , as a resul@@ t , mar@@ gin@@ aliz@@ ed ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ."
The au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ies did not have the reason to make economic grow@@ th happen so that they could ta@@ x people and make more money for to run their business .
Because they were getting it from ab@@ ro@@ ad .
"And in fact , if you see o@@ il@@ -@@ ri@@ ch countries , where ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens are not yet em@@ power@@ ed , the same thing goes — Nigeri@@ a , S@@ aud@@ i A@@ ra@@ bi@@ a , all sor@@ ts of countries ."
Because the a@@ id and oil or min@@ er@@ al money ac@@ ts the same way .
"It em@@ pow@@ ers au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ies , without acti@@ v@@ ating the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens — their h@@ ands , le@@ gs , bra@@ ins , what have you ."
"And if you ag@@ ree with that , then I think the best way to impro@@ ve these countries is to re@@ cogni@@ ze that economic develo@@ pment is of the people , by the people , for the people ."
And that is the real network effe@@ ct .
"If ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens can network and make themselves more organiz@@ ed and produ@@ ctive , so that their vo@@ i@@ ces are heard , so then things would impro@@ ve ."
"And to con@@ tra@@ st that , you can see the most important institu@@ tion in the world , the World B@@ ank , is an organiz@@ ation of the government , by the government , for the govern@@ ments ."
J@@ ust see the con@@ tra@@ st .
"And that is the perspe@@ ctive I have , and then I can start my story ."
"O@@ f course , how would you em@@ power ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ?"
There could be all sor@@ ts of technolog@@ ies . And one is cell ph@@ ones .
"R@@ e@@ cent@@ ly &quot; &quot; The E@@ con@@ omi@@ st &quot; &quot; re@@ cogni@@ zed this , but I st@@ um@@ b@@ led upo@@ n the idea 12 years ago , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been working on ."
"So 12 years ago , I was trying to be an inv@@ est@@ ment ban@@ k@@ er in New York ."
We had — quite a few our colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es were conne@@ cted by a computer network .
And we got more produ@@ ctive because we didn &apos;t have to ex@@ change flo@@ pp@@ y di@@ sk@@ s ; we could up@@ d@@ ate each other more often .
But one time it bro@@ ke down .
And it re@@ min@@ ded me of a day in 19@@ 7@@ 1 .
There was a war going on in my country .
"And my family mo@@ ved out of an urb@@ an place , where we used to live , to a re@@ mot@@ e ru@@ ral area where it was sa@@ f@@ er ."
And one time my mother asked me to get some medi@@ cine for a youn@@ ger si@@ b@@ ling .
"And I wal@@ ked 10 miles or so , all morning , to get there , to the medi@@ cine man ."
"And he wasn &apos;t there , so I wal@@ ked all af@@ ter@@ no@@ on back ."
So I had another un@@ produ@@ ctive day .
"So while I was sitting in a t@@ all building in New York , I put those two exper@@ ien@@ ces together side by side , and basically con@@ clu@@ ded that conne@@ cti@@ vity is produ@@ cti@@ vity — whether it &apos;s in a moder@@ n offi@@ ce or an under@@ develo@@ ped vi@@ ll@@ age ."
"So natur@@ ally , I — the im@@ p@@ lic@@ ation of that is that the tele@@ phone is a we@@ apo@@ n against po@@ ver@@ ty ."
"And if that &apos;s the case , then the question is how many tele@@ ph@@ ones did we have at that time ?"
"And it turns out , that there was one tele@@ phone in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h for every 500 people ."
And all those ph@@ ones were in the few urb@@ an places .
"The v@@ ast ru@@ ral are@@ as , where 100 million people li@@ ved , there were no tele@@ ph@@ ones ."
"So just imagine how many man@@ -@@ months or man@@ -@@ years are wa@@ st@@ ed , just like I wa@@ st@@ ed a day ."
"If you just mul@@ ti@@ ply by 100 million people , let &apos;s say lo@@ sing one day a mon@@ th , whatever , and you see a v@@ ast amount of re@@ source wa@@ st@@ ed ."
"And after all , po@@ or countries , like ri@@ ch countries , one thing we &apos;ve got equ@@ al , is their days are the same len@@ g@@ th : 2@@ 4 hours ."
"So if you lo@@ se that pre@@ ci@@ ous re@@ source , where you are some@@ what equ@@ al to the ri@@ ch@@ er countries , that &apos;s a huge wa@@ ste ."
So I started looking for any evi@@ dence that — does conne@@ cti@@ vity really incre@@ ase produ@@ cti@@ vity ?
"And I couldn &apos;t find much , really , but I found this gra@@ ph produ@@ ced by the I@@ T@@ U , which is the Inter@@ national T@@ ele@@ communi@@ cation Uni@@ on , based in G@@ en@@ ev@@ a ."
They show an interesting thing .
"That you see , the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tal ax@@ is is where you place your country ."
"So the United States or the U@@ K would be here , outside ."
"And so the impac@@ t of one new tele@@ phone , which is on the ver@@ tical ax@@ is , is very little ."
"But if you come back to a po@@ ore@@ r country , where the G@@ N@@ P per ca@@ pi@@ ta is , let &apos;s say , 500 dollars , or 3@@ 00 dollars , then the impac@@ t is huge : 6@@ ,000 dollars . O@@ r 5@@ ,000 dollars ."
"The question was , how much did it cost to in@@ st@@ all a new tele@@ phone in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h ?"
"It turns out : 2@@ ,000 dollars ."
"So if you spend 2@@ ,000 dollars , and let &apos;s say the tele@@ phone la@@ sts 10 years , and if 5@@ ,000 dollars every year — so that &apos;s 5@@ 0,000 dollars ."
So obvi@@ ously this was a g@@ ad@@ get to have .
"And of course , if the cost of in@@ stal@@ ling a tele@@ phone is going down , because there &apos;s a di@@ gi@@ tal re@@ v@@ olution going on , then it would be even more dra@@ m@@ atic ."
And I knew a little econ@@ omi@@ cs by then — it says A@@ d@@ am S@@ mi@@ th t@@ au@@ ght us that speci@@ aliz@@ ation le@@ ads to produ@@ cti@@ vity .
But how would you speci@@ ali@@ ze ?
Let &apos;s say I &apos;m a fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man and a farm@@ er .
And Ch@@ ris is a fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man farm@@ er . B@@ ot@@ h are gener@@ ali@@ sts .
"So the point is that we could only — the only way we could de@@ p@@ end on each other , is if we can conne@@ ct with each other ."
"And if we are neigh@@ b@@ ors , I could just walk over to his house ."
But then we are li@@ mi@@ ting our economic sp@@ here to something very small area .
"But in order to ex@@ p@@ and that , you need a ri@@ ver , or you need a high@@ way , or you need tele@@ phone lin@@ es ."
"But in any ev@@ ent , it &apos;s conne@@ cti@@ vity that le@@ ads to depen@@ d@@ ability ."
And that le@@ ads to speci@@ aliz@@ ation .
That le@@ ads to produ@@ cti@@ vity .
"So the question was , I started looking at this issue , and going back and for@@ th between B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h and New York ."
There were a lot of reas@@ ons people told me why we don &apos;t have enough tele@@ ph@@ ones .
And one of them is the l@@ ac@@ king bu@@ ying power .
Po@@ or people ap@@ par@@ ently don &apos;t have the power to bu@@ y .
"But the point is , if it &apos;s a produ@@ ction to@@ ol , why do we have to wor@@ ry about that ?"
"I mean , in America , people bu@@ y cars , and they put very little money down ."
"They get a car , and they go to work ."
The work pa@@ ys them a s@@ al@@ ary ; the s@@ al@@ ary allow@@ s them to pay for the car over time .
The car pa@@ ys for itself .
"So if the tele@@ phone is a produ@@ ction to@@ ol , then we don &apos;t quite have to wor@@ ry about the pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ing power ."
"And of course , even if that &apos;s true , then what about ini@@ tial bu@@ ying power ?"
"So then the question is , why can &apos;t we have some kind of sh@@ ared ac@@ cess ?"
"In the United States , we have — everybody needs a ban@@ king ser@@ vice , but very few of us are trying to bu@@ y a b@@ ank ."
So it &apos;s — a b@@ ank ten@@ ds to ser@@ ve a whole community .
So we could do that for tele@@ ph@@ ones .
"And also people told me that we have a lot of important pri@@ mar@@ y needs to me@@ et : food , clo@@ thing , sh@@ el@@ ter , whatever ."
"But again , it &apos;s very pat@@ er@@ n@@ ali@@ stic ."
You should be ra@@ is@@ ing in@@ come and let people deci@@ de what they want to do with their money .
But the real problem is the l@@ ack of other in@@ fra@@ stru@@ ctures .
"S@@ e@@ e , you need some kind of in@@ fra@@ structure to bring a new thing ."
"For in@@ stance , the Inter@@ net was bo@@ om@@ ing in the U.@@ S@@ ."
because there were — there were people who had compu@@ ters .
They had mode@@ ms .
"They had tele@@ phone lin@@ es , so it &apos;s very e@@ asy to bring in a new idea , like the Inter@@ net ."
But that &apos;s what &apos;s l@@ ac@@ king in a po@@ or country .
"So for example , we didn &apos;t have ways to have cre@@ d@@ it che@@ cks , few ban@@ ks to colle@@ ct bi@@ l@@ ls , et@@ c ."
"But that &apos;s why I noti@@ ced G@@ ra@@ me@@ en B@@ ank , which is a b@@ ank for po@@ or people , and had 1@@ ,@@ 100 bran@@ ch@@ es , 1@@ 2@@ ,000 em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es , 2@@ .@@ 3 million bor@@ row@@ ers ."
And they had these bran@@ ch@@ es .
I thought I could put cell tow@@ ers and create a network .
"And any@@ way , to cut the time shor@@ t — so I started — I first went to them and said , &quot; You know , per@@ haps I could conne@@ ct all your bran@@ ch@@ es and make you more ef@@ fi@@ cient . &quot;"
"But you know , they have , after all , ev@@ olved in a country without tele@@ ph@@ ones , so they are de@@ cen@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed . I mean , of course there might be other good reas@@ ons , but this was one of the reas@@ ons — they had to be ."
"And so they were not that interested to conne@@ ct all their bran@@ ch@@ es , and then to be — and ro@@ ck the boat ."
So I started fo@@ c@@ using . What is it that they really do ?
So what happens is that somebody bor@@ row@@ s money from the b@@ ank .
She ty@@ pi@@ cally bu@@ ys a c@@ ow . The c@@ ow gi@@ ves mi@@ l@@ k .
"And she sel@@ ls the mi@@ l@@ k to the vi@@ ll@@ ag@@ ers , and pa@@ ys off the lo@@ an ."
"And this is a business for her , but it &apos;s mi@@ l@@ k for everybody else ."
And sud@@ den@@ ly I realized that a cell phone could be a c@@ ow .
"Because some way she could bor@@ row 2@@ 00 dollars from the b@@ ank , get a phone and have the phone for everybody ."
And it &apos;s a business for her .
"So I wro@@ te to the b@@ ank , and they thought for a while , and they said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a little c@@ razy , but logi@@ cal ."
"If you think it can be done , come and make it happen . &quot; &quot; So I qu@@ it my job ; I went back to B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h ."
"I created a company in America called G@@ on@@ of@@ one , which in B@@ eng@@ ali means &quot; &quot; people &apos;s phone . &quot; &quot; And ang@@ el inv@@ est@@ ors in America put in money into that ."
I f@@ le@@ w around the world .
"A@@ f@@ ter about a million — I mean , I got re@@ je@@ cted from lots of places , because I was not only trying to go to a po@@ or country , I was trying to go to the po@@ or of the po@@ or country ."
"A@@ f@@ ter about a million miles , and a me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful — a sub@@ stan@@ tial lo@@ ss of ha@@ ir , I ev@@ en@@ tually put together a con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um , and — which inv@@ olved the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an tele@@ phone company , which provi@@ ded the know@@ -@@ how , and the G@@ ra@@ me@@ en B@@ ank provi@@ ded the in@@ fra@@ structure to sp@@ read the ser@@ vice ."
"To make the story shor@@ t , here is the co@@ ver@@ age of the country ."
You can see it &apos;s pretty much co@@ vered .
"E@@ ven in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h , there are some em@@ p@@ ty places ."
But we are also inv@@ est@@ ing around another 3@@ 00 million dollars this year to ex@@ ten@@ d that co@@ ver@@ age .
"Now , about that c@@ ow model I tal@@ ked about ."
"There are about 1@@ 1@@ 5@@ ,000 people who are re@@ ta@@ il@@ ing tele@@ phone ser@@ vi@@ ces in their neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods ."
"And it &apos;s ser@@ ving 5@@ 2@@ ,000 vi@@ ll@@ ages , which re@@ present about 80 million people ."
And these ph@@ ones are gener@@ ating about 100 million dollars for the company .
"And two dollars prof@@ it per ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur per day , which is like 7@@ 00 dollars per year ."
"And of course , it &apos;s very b@@ ene@@ fi@@ cial in a lot of ways ."
"It incre@@ ases in@@ come , impro@@ ves wel@@ f@@ are , et@@ c ."
"And the resul@@ t is , right now , this company is the largest tele@@ phone company , with 3@@ .@@ 5 million sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ bers , 1@@ 1@@ 5@@ ,000 of these ph@@ ones I tal@@ ked about — that produ@@ ces about a third of the traf@@ fic in the network ."
"And 200@@ 4 , the net prof@@ it , after ta@@ x@@ es — very seri@@ ous ta@@ x@@ es — was 1@@ 20 million dollars ."
And the company con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted about 19@@ 0 million dollars to the government co@@ f@@ f@@ ers .
"And again , here are some of the l@@ ess@@ ons ."
&quot; The government needs to provi@@ de econ@@ omi@@ cally vi@@ able ser@@ vi@@ ces . &quot;
"A@@ c@@ tually , this is an in@@ stance where pri@@ v@@ ate comp@@ an@@ ies can provi@@ de that ."
&quot; G@@ over@@ n@@ ments need to sub@@ si@@ di@@ ze pri@@ v@@ ate comp@@ an@@ ies . &quot;
This is what some people think .
"And actually , pri@@ v@@ ate comp@@ an@@ ies help govern@@ ments with ta@@ x@@ es ."
&quot; Po@@ or people are re@@ ci@@ pie@@ n@@ ts . &quot;
Po@@ or people are a re@@ source .
&quot; S@@ er@@ vi@@ ces cost too much for the po@@ or . &quot;
Th@@ e@@ ir inv@@ ol@@ v@@ ement redu@@ ces the cost .
&quot; The po@@ or are u@@ ne@@ du@@ c@@ ated and cannot do much . &quot;
They are very e@@ ag@@ er lear@@ n@@ ers and very cap@@ able survi@@ v@@ ors .
I &apos;ve been very sur@@ pri@@ sed .
Mo@@ st of them learn how to oper@@ ate a tele@@ phone within a day .
&quot; Po@@ or countries need a@@ id . &quot;
"B@@ us@@ in@@ ess@@ es — this one company has ra@@ is@@ ed the — if the ide@@ al figu@@ res are even five percent true , this one company is ra@@ is@@ ing the G@@ N@@ P of the country much more than the a@@ id the country re@@ cei@@ ves ."
"And as I was trying to show you , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned , a@@ id does dam@@ ages because it re@@ mo@@ ves the government from its ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ."
"And this is a new project I have with De@@ an K@@ am@@ en , the fam@@ ous inv@@ ent@@ or in America ."
"He has produ@@ ced some power gener@@ at@@ ors , which we are now doing an experim@@ ent in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h , in two vi@@ ll@@ ages where c@@ ow man@@ ure is produ@@ cing bi@@ og@@ as , which is ru@@ n@@ ning these gener@@ at@@ ors ."
And each of these gener@@ at@@ ors is sel@@ ling electri@@ city to 20 h@@ ous@@ es each .
It &apos;s just an experim@@ ent .
"We don &apos;t know how far it will go , but it &apos;s going on ."
Thank you .
"Well , Ar@@ th@@ ur C@@ . C@@ lar@@ ke , a fam@@ ous science fi@@ ction wri@@ ter from the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , said that , &quot; &quot; We over@@ est@@ im@@ ate technology in the shor@@ t ter@@ m , and we under@@ est@@ im@@ ate it in the long ter@@ m . &quot; &quot; And I think that &apos;s some of the fe@@ ar that we see about j@@ ob@@ s disa@@ p@@ pe@@ aring from arti@@ fi@@ cial inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence and rob@@ ots ."
"Because the demo@@ gra@@ phi@@ cs are really going to leave us with lots of j@@ ob@@ s that need doing and that we , our society , is going to have to be built on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders of ste@@ el of rob@@ ots in the future ."
But fe@@ ar of lo@@ sing j@@ ob@@ s to technology has been around for a long time .
And they would look that up .
The li@@ br@@ ari@@ ans were af@@ ra@@ id their j@@ ob@@ s were going to disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar .
But that &apos;s not what happened in fact .
And I think everyone from 19@@ 5@@ 7 tot@@ ally under@@ est@@ im@@ ated the level of technology we would all car@@ ry around in our h@@ ands and in our po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts today .
S@@ ame thing happened in offi@@ ces .
"B@@ ack in the old days , people used sp@@ re@@ ad@@ sh@@ e@@ ets ."
"S@@ pre@@ ad@@ sh@@ e@@ ets were sp@@ read sh@@ e@@ ets of pa@@ per , and they cal@@ cu@@ lated by hand ."
But here was an interesting thing that came along .
So offi@@ ce wor@@ k@@ ers became progra@@ m@@ m@@ ers of sp@@ re@@ ad@@ sh@@ e@@ ets .
It incre@@ as@@ ed their cap@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies .
"They no longer had to do the mu@@ n@@ dane compu@@ t@@ ations , but they could do something much more ."
"Now today , we &apos;re star@@ ting to see rob@@ ots in our lives ."
O@@ n the left there is the P@@ ac@@ k@@ B@@ ot from i@@ Rob@@ ot .
So the robot takes over the d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous j@@ ob@@ s .
O@@ n the right are some T@@ U@@ G@@ s from a company called A@@ e@@ th@@ on in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh .
These are in hundre@@ ds of ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s across the U.@@ S.
They take the di@@ r@@ ty di@@ sh@@ es back to the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en .
They bring the medi@@ cin@@ es up from the ph@@ ar@@ m@@ acy .
"In fact , rob@@ ots have become sort of u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous in our lives in many ways ."
"But I think when it comes to fac@@ t@@ ory rob@@ ots , people are sort of af@@ ra@@ id , because fac@@ t@@ ory rob@@ ots are d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous to be around ."
"In order to program them , you have to understand si@@ x@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal ve@@ ct@@ ors and qu@@ at@@ er@@ ni@@ ons ."
And I think it &apos;s the sort of technology that &apos;s gone wrong .
And I think we really have to look at technolog@@ ies that ordin@@ ary wor@@ k@@ ers can inter@@ act with .
"And so I want to tell you today about B@@ ax@@ ter , which we &apos;ve been talking about ."
"And if the li@@ gh@@ ting isn &apos;t too extre@@ me — A@@ h , ah ! There it is . It &apos;s pi@@ cked up the obje@@ ct off the con@@ ve@@ y@@ or ."
It &apos;s going to come bring it over here and put it down .
The interesting thing is B@@ ax@@ ter has some basi@@ c common sense .
"B@@ y the way , what &apos;s going on with the eyes ?"
The eyes are on the scre@@ en there .
"It &apos;s got a little bit of basi@@ c common sense , goes and pi@@ cks the obje@@ cts ."
And B@@ ax@@ ter &apos;s sa@@ fe to inter@@ act with .
You wouldn &apos;t want to do this with a cur@@ r@@ ent indu@@ stri@@ al robot .
"It feel@@ s the force , under@@ stan@@ ds that Ch@@ ris is there and doesn &apos;t p@@ us@@ h through him and h@@ ur@@ t him ."
But I think the most interesting thing about B@@ ax@@ ter is the us@@ er inter@@ face .
You can see some i@@ con@@ s on the left of the scre@@ en there for what was about its right ar@@ m .
"And the robot figu@@ res out , ah , he must mean I want to put stuff down ."
It pu@@ ts a little i@@ c@@ on there .
"He comes over here , and he gets the fin@@ g@@ ers to gra@@ s@@ p together , and the robot in@@ f@@ ers , ah , you want an obje@@ ct for me to pi@@ ck up ."
That pu@@ ts the green i@@ c@@ on there .
He &apos;s going to ma@@ p out an area of where the robot should pi@@ ck up the obje@@ ct from .
He didn &apos;t have to se@@ le@@ ct that from a men@@ u .
These rob@@ ots we &apos;re shi@@ pping every day .
They go to fac@@ tor@@ ies around the country .
M@@ il@@ dre@@ d &apos;s a fac@@ t@@ ory wor@@ k@@ er in Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ cut .
She decided she really li@@ ked rob@@ ots .
And it was doing the simple re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive t@@ as@@ ks that she had had to do be@@ fore@@ hand .
"They &apos;re ol@@ der , and they &apos;re getting ol@@ der and ol@@ der ."
We &apos;re not gi@@ ving them to@@ ols that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use .
De@@ mo@@ gra@@ phi@@ cs is really going to change our world .
This is the per@@ cent@@ age of ad@@ ul@@ ts who are working age .
"But more than that , as we get ol@@ der we get more fra@@ il and we can &apos;t do all the t@@ as@@ ks we used to do ."
"If we look at the st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs on the ages of car@@ e@@ gi@@ ver@@ s , before our eyes those car@@ e@@ gi@@ ver@@ s are getting ol@@ der and ol@@ der ."
That &apos;s happening st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cally right now .
"G@@ e@@ tting the gro@@ cer@@ ies in from the car , up the sta@@ ir@@ s , into the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en ."
And I think rob@@ oti@@ cs gi@@ ves people a ch@@ ance to have di@@ gni@@ ty as they get ol@@ der by having control of the rob@@ oti@@ c solution .
And that we will all come to re@@ ly on rob@@ ots over the next 40 years as part of our every@@ day lives .
Th@@ an@@ ks very much .

"( Music ) These bees are in my back@@ y@@ ard in B@@ er@@ k@@ ele@@ y , C@@ alifor@@ nia ."
"And as you may know , bees pol@@ lin@@ ate one third of our food cro@@ ps , and lat@@ ely they &apos;ve been having a really hard time ."
"So as a photograph@@ er , I wanted to expl@@ ore what this problem really looks like ."
So I &apos;m going to show you what I found over the last year .
"This f@@ ur@@ ry little cre@@ ature is a fre@@ sh young be@@ e hal@@ f@@ way em@@ er@@ g@@ ed from its bro@@ od cell , and bees right now are de@@ al@@ ing with se@@ ver@@ al different problems , inclu@@ ding pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , dise@@ ases , and ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at lo@@ ss , but the single gre@@ at@@ est thre@@ at is a par@@ a@@ si@@ tic mi@@ te from A@@ si@@ a , V@@ ar@@ ro@@ a de@@ stru@@ ctor ."
And this p@@ in@@ he@@ ad@@ -@@ si@@ zed mi@@ te c@@ raw@@ ls on@@ to young bees and su@@ cks their blo@@ od .
"This ev@@ en@@ tually de@@ stro@@ ys a hi@@ ve because it we@@ ak@@ ens the im@@ mu@@ ne system of the bees , and it makes them more v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able to stre@@ ss and dise@@ ase ."
"Now , bees are the most sen@@ si@@ tive when they &apos;re develo@@ ping inside their bro@@ od cells , and I wanted to know what that process really looks like , so I te@@ am@@ ed up with a be@@ e la@@ b at U.@@ C@@ . D@@ av@@ is and figu@@ red out how to ra@@ ise bees in front of a cam@@ era ."
I &apos;m going to show you the first 2@@ 1 days of a be@@ e &apos;s life con@@ den@@ sed into 60 secon@@ ds .
"This is a be@@ e e@@ g@@ g as it h@@ at@@ ch@@ es into a lar@@ v@@ a , and those ne@@ w@@ ly h@@ at@@ ched lar@@ v@@ a@@ e s@@ wi@@ m around their cells fe@@ e@@ ding on this white go@@ o that n@@ ur@@ se bees se@@ cre@@ te for them ."
"Th@@ en , their head and their le@@ gs s@@ low@@ ly differ@@ enti@@ ate as they trans@@ form into pu@@ pa@@ e ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s that same pu@@ p@@ ation process , and you can actually see the mi@@ tes ru@@ n@@ ning around in the cells ."
Th@@ en the ti@@ s@@ su@@ e in their body re@@ organiz@@ es and the pi@@ g@@ ment s@@ low@@ ly develo@@ ps in their eyes .
The last ste@@ p of the process is their sk@@ in sh@@ ri@@ v@@ els up and they s@@ pro@@ u@@ t ha@@ ir .
"( Music ) So — ( Applause ) A@@ s you can see hal@@ f@@ way through that video , the mi@@ tes were ru@@ n@@ ning around on the b@@ aby bees , and the way that be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ per@@ s ty@@ pi@@ cally man@@ age these mi@@ tes is they tre@@ at their hi@@ ves with chemi@@ cal@@ s ."
"In the long run , that &apos;s bad news , so resear@@ ch@@ ers are working on fin@@ ding alter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves to control these mi@@ tes ."
This is one of those alter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves .
"It &apos;s an experim@@ ent@@ al bre@@ e@@ ding program at the U@@ S@@ D@@ A Be@@ e L@@ a@@ b in B@@ at@@ on R@@ ou@@ ge , and this qu@@ e@@ en and her at@@ ten@@ d@@ ant bees are part of that program ."
This is what it takes to bre@@ ed bees in a la@@ b .
The vi@@ r@@ g@@ in qu@@ e@@ en is se@@ d@@ ated and then arti@@ fi@@ cially in@@ se@@ min@@ ated using this pre@@ ci@@ sion instru@@ ment .
"Now , this pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re allow@@ s the resear@@ ch@@ ers to control exactly which bees are being cro@@ s@@ sed , but there &apos;s a tra@@ de@@ off in having this much control ."
"They suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed in bre@@ e@@ ding mi@@ te@@ -@@ resi@@ st@@ ant bees , but in that process , those bees started to lo@@ se tra@@ its like their g@@ ent@@ len@@ ess and their ability to stor@@ e hon@@ ey , so to over@@ come that problem , these resear@@ ch@@ ers are now col@@ labor@@ ating with comm@@ er@@ cial be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ per@@ s ."
"This is B@@ re@@ t A@@ de@@ e open@@ ing one of his 7@@ 2@@ ,000 be@@ e@@ hi@@ ves ."
"He and his bro@@ ther run the largest be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ ping oper@@ ation in the world , and the U@@ S@@ D@@ A is inte@@ gr@@ ating their mi@@ te@@ -@@ resi@@ st@@ ant bees into his oper@@ ation with the hope that over time , they &apos;ll be able to se@@ le@@ ct the bees that are not only mi@@ te@@ -@@ resi@@ st@@ ant but also re@@ tain all of these qu@@ ali@@ ties that make them us@@ e@@ ful to us ."
"And to say it like that makes it sound like we &apos;re m@@ ani@@ pu@@ lat@@ ing and ex@@ plo@@ i@@ ting bees , and the tru@@ th is , we &apos;ve been doing that for thousands of years ."
"We took this wi@@ ld cre@@ ature and put it inside of a box , prac@@ ti@@ cally dom@@ esti@@ c@@ ating it , and ori@@ gin@@ ally that was so that we could har@@ v@@ est their hon@@ ey , but over time we started lo@@ sing our n@@ ative pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors , our wi@@ ld pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors , and there are many places now where those wi@@ ld pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors can no longer me@@ et the pol@@ lin@@ ation de@@ man@@ ds of our agri@@ culture , so these man@@ aged bees have become an inte@@ gra@@ l part of our food system ."
"So when people talk about sa@@ ving bees , my inter@@ pret@@ ation of that is we need to sa@@ ve our relation@@ ship to bees , and in order to design new solu@@ tions , we have to understand the basi@@ c bio@@ logy of bees and understand the effe@@ cts of stre@@ s@@ sor@@ s that we sometimes cannot see ."
"In other words , we have to understand bees up close ."
Thank you .
So I really consi@@ der myself a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler .
"But I don &apos;t really tell stories in the usu@@ al way , in the sense that I don &apos;t usu@@ ally tell my own stories ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I &apos;m really interested in building to@@ ols that al@@ low large num@@ bers of other people to tell their stories , people all around the world ."
I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common .
"I think people are very si@@ mi@@ lar , but I also think that we have t@@ rou@@ ble seeing that ."
"You know , as I look around the world I see a lot of g@@ ap@@ s , and I think we all see a lot of g@@ ap@@ s ."
And we def@@ ine ourselves by our g@@ ap@@ s .
"There &apos;s language g@@ ap@@ s , there &apos;s e@@ th@@ ni@@ city and rac@@ i@@ al g@@ ap@@ s , there &apos;s age g@@ ap@@ s , there &apos;s gen@@ der g@@ ap@@ s , there &apos;s se@@ x@@ u@@ ality g@@ ap@@ s , there &apos;s we@@ alth and money g@@ ap@@ s , there &apos;s education g@@ ap@@ s , there &apos;s also religi@@ ous g@@ ap@@ s ."
"You know , we have all these g@@ ap@@ s and I think we like our g@@ ap@@ s because they make us feel like we iden@@ ti@@ fy with something , some s@@ mal@@ ler community ."
"But I think that actually , des@@ pi@@ te our g@@ ap@@ s , we really have a lot in common ."
And I think one thing we have in common is a very de@@ ep need to ex@@ pre@@ ss ourselves .
I think this is a very old human de@@ si@@ re . It &apos;s nothing new .
But the thing about self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion is that there &apos;s tra@@ di@@ tion@@ ally been this im@@ bal@@ ance between the de@@ si@@ re that we have to ex@@ pre@@ ss ourselves and the number of sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic friends who are wil@@ ling to stand around and list@@ en .
"( Laughter ) This , also , is nothing new ."
"S@@ in@@ ce the daw@@ n of human history , we &apos;ve tr@@ ied to re@@ cti@@ fy this im@@ bal@@ ance by making art , writing po@@ em@@ s , sing@@ ing son@@ gs , sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ting e@@ di@@ t@@ ori@@ als and sen@@ ding them in to a ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er , go@@ s@@ si@@ ping with friends . This is nothing new ."
"What &apos;s new is that in the last se@@ ver@@ al years a lot of these very tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal physi@@ cal human acti@@ vi@@ ties , these ac@@ ts of self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , have been moving on@@ to the Inter@@ net ."
"And as that &apos;s happened , people have been lea@@ ving behind fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ ts , fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ ts that tell stories of their mom@@ ents of self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion ."
"And so what I do is , I write computer progra@@ ms that study very large se@@ ts of these fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ ts , and then try to dra@@ w con@@ clu@@ sions about the people who left them — what they feel , what they think , what &apos;s different in the world today than usu@@ al , these sor@@ ts of questions ."
"One project that ex@@ plo@@ res these ideas , which was made about a year ago , is a piece called We F@@ e@@ el F@@ ine ."
"This is a piece that every two or three minutes sc@@ ans the world &apos;s ne@@ w@@ ly@@ -@@ post@@ ed blo@@ g en@@ tries for oc@@ cur@@ ren@@ ces of the ph@@ ra@@ ses &quot; &quot; I feel &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; I am feeling . &quot; &quot; And when it fin@@ ds one of those ph@@ ra@@ ses , it gra@@ b@@ s the s@@ ent@@ ence up to the per@@ i@@ od , and then au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally tries to de@@ du@@ ce the age , gen@@ der and ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal lo@@ cation of the person that wro@@ te that s@@ ent@@ ence ."
"Th@@ en , know@@ ing the ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal lo@@ cation and the time , we can also then figure out the we@@ a@@ ther when that person wro@@ te the s@@ ent@@ ence ."
"A@@ ll of this information is sa@@ ved in a d@@ at@@ ab@@ ase that colle@@ cts about 20@@ ,000 feel@@ ings a day ."
It &apos;s been ru@@ n@@ ning for about a year and a half .
It &apos;s re@@ ach@@ ed about se@@ ven@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half million human feel@@ ings now .
And I &apos;ll show you a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of how this information is then vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ ed . So this is We F@@ e@@ el F@@ ine .
"What you see here is a m@@ ad@@ ly s@@ war@@ ming mas@@ s of parti@@ cles , each of which re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts a single human feeling that was st@@ ated in the last few hours ."
"The color of each parti@@ cle cor@@ respon@@ ds to the ty@@ pe of feeling inside — so that happy , posi@@ tive feel@@ ings are bri@@ gh@@ tly co@@ lo@@ red ."
"And sa@@ d , neg@@ ative feel@@ ings are dar@@ k@@ ly co@@ lo@@ red ."
"The di@@ am@@ e@@ ter of each do@@ t re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts the len@@ g@@ th of the s@@ ent@@ ence inside , so that the large d@@ ots con@@ tain large s@@ ent@@ ences , and the small d@@ ots con@@ tain small s@@ ent@@ ences ."
"A@@ ny do@@ t can be c@@ lic@@ ked and ex@@ pan@@ ded . And we see here , &quot; &quot; I would just feel so much better if I could cur@@ l up in his ar@@ ms right now and feel his af@@ fe@@ ction for me in the em@@ brac@@ e of his body and the ten@@ der@@ ness of his li@@ ps . &quot; &quot; So it gets pretty ho@@ t and ste@@ amy sometimes in the world of human emoti@@ ons ."
"And all of these are st@@ ated by people : &quot; &quot; I know that obje@@ cti@@ vely it really doesn &apos;t mean much , but after sp@@ ending so many years as a small fish in a big po@@ nd , it &apos;s nice to feel bi@@ g@@ ger again . &quot; &quot; The d@@ ots ex@@ hi@@ bit human qu@@ ali@@ ties . They kind of have their own physi@@ cs , and they s@@ war@@ m wil@@ d@@ ly around , kind of expl@@ or@@ ing the world of life ."
And then they also ex@@ hi@@ bit cu@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty .
You can see a few of them are s@@ war@@ ming around the cur@@ s@@ or right now .
You can see some other ones are s@@ war@@ ming around the bot@@ tom left cor@@ ner of the scre@@ en around six words . Th@@ ose six words re@@ present the six mov@@ em@@ ents of We F@@ e@@ el F@@ ine . We &apos;re cur@@ r@@ ently seeing M@@ ad@@ ness .
"There &apos;s also M@@ ur@@ mu@@ r@@ s , M@@ on@@ t@@ age , M@@ ob@@ s , Me@@ tri@@ cs and M@@ oun@@ ds ."
And I &apos;ll walk you through a few of those now .
M@@ ur@@ mu@@ r@@ s ca@@ uses all of the feel@@ ings to f@@ ly to the ce@@ il@@ ing .
"And then , one by one , in re@@ verse chro@@ no@@ logi@@ cal order , they ex@@ c@@ use themselves , en@@ ter@@ ing the sc@@ rol@@ ling li@@ st of feel@@ ings ."
&quot; I feel a bit better now . &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; I feel con@@ f@@ used and un@@ sure of what the he@@ ll I want to do . &quot;
&quot; I feel g@@ y@@ pped out of something aw@@ es@@ ome here . &quot;
&quot; I feel so f@@ ree ; I feel so good . &quot;
&quot; I feel like I &apos;m in this fo@@ g of de@@ pres@@ sion that I can &apos;t get out of . &quot;
"And you can cli@@ ck any of these to go out and visi@@ t the blo@@ g from which it was colle@@ cted . And in that way , you can conne@@ ct with the au@@ th@@ ors of these stat@@ em@@ ents if you feel some de@@ gre@@ e of em@@ pa@@ th@@ y ."
The next movement is called M@@ on@@ t@@ age .
M@@ on@@ t@@ age ca@@ uses all of the feel@@ ings that con@@ tain photograph@@ s to become ex@@ trac@@ ted and disp@@ l@@ ay themselves in a g@@ ri@@ d .
"This g@@ ri@@ d is then said to re@@ present the picture of the world &apos;s feel@@ ings in the last few hours , if you will ."
E@@ ach of these can be c@@ lic@@ ked and we can b@@ low it up .
"We see , &quot; &quot; I just feel like I &apos;m not going to have fun if it &apos;s not the both of us . &quot; &quot; That was from someone in Mi@@ chi@@ g@@ an ."
"We see , &quot; &quot; I feel like I have been at a computer all day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) These are au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally con@@ stru@@ cted using the found obje@@ cts : &quot; I think I feel a little full . &quot;"
The next movement is called mo@@ b@@ s .
M@@ ob@@ s provi@@ des different st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cal bre@@ ak@@ dow@@ ns of the popul@@ ation of the world &apos;s feel@@ ings in the last few hours .
"We see that &quot; &quot; better &quot; &quot; is the most fre@@ qu@@ ent feeling right now , fol@@ low@@ ed by &quot; &quot; good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ il@@ ty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; si@@ ck &quot; &quot; and so on ."
We can also get a gen@@ der bre@@ ak@@ down .
And we see that women are sli@@ gh@@ tly more pro@@ li@@ fic talking about their emoti@@ ons in the last few hours than men .
"We can do an age bre@@ ak@@ down , which gi@@ ves us a hi@@ st@@ ogra@@ m of the world &apos;s emoti@@ onal di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion by age ."
"We see people in their tw@@ ent@@ ies are the most pro@@ li@@ fic , fol@@ low@@ ed by te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers , and then people in their th@@ ir@@ ties , and it d@@ ies out very quickly from there ."
"In we@@ a@@ ther , the feel@@ ings as@@ su@@ me the physi@@ cal char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ sti@@ cs of the we@@ a@@ ther that they re@@ present , so that the ones colle@@ cted on a su@@ n@@ ny day s@@ wi@@ r@@ l around as if they &apos;re part of the su@@ n ."
The cl@@ ou@@ dy ones flo@@ at along as if they &apos;re on a bre@@ e@@ ze .
"The ra@@ iny ones f@@ all down as if they &apos;re in a ra@@ in@@ stor@@ m , and the s@@ nowy ones kind of flu@@ t@@ ter to the ground ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , lo@@ cation ca@@ uses the feel@@ ings to move to their posi@@ tions on a world ma@@ p show@@ ing the ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion of feel@@ ings ."
Me@@ tri@@ cs provi@@ des more num@@ eri@@ cal vie@@ ws on the data .
We see that the world is feeling &quot; &quot; used &quot; &quot; at 3@@ .@@ 3 times the nor@@ mal level right now .
"( Laughter ) They &apos;re feeling &quot; &quot; war@@ m &quot; &quot; at 2@@ .@@ 9 times the nor@@ mal level , and so on ."
O@@ ther vie@@ ws are also available .
"H@@ ere are gen@@ der , age , we@@ a@@ ther , lo@@ cation ."
The fin@@ al movement is called M@@ oun@@ ds .
It &apos;s a bit different from the others .
"M@@ oun@@ ds vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ es the entire d@@ at@@ as@@ et as large , g@@ el@@ at@@ in@@ ous blo@@ b@@ s which kind of j@@ i@@ gg@@ le ."
"And if I h@@ old down my cur@@ s@@ or , they do a little dance ."
"We see &quot; &quot; better &quot; &quot; is the most fre@@ qu@@ ent feeling , fol@@ low@@ ed by &quot; &quot; bad . &quot; &quot; And then if I go over here , the li@@ st begin@@ s to sc@@ ro@@ ll , and there are actually thousands of feel@@ ings that have been colle@@ cted ."
"You can see the little p@@ in@@ k cur@@ s@@ or moving along , re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing our posi@@ tion ."
"H@@ ere we see people that feel &quot; &quot; sli@@ pping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; na@@ us@@ e@@ ous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respon@@ si@@ ble . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s also a sear@@ ch cap@@ ability , if you &apos;re interested in fin@@ ding out about a certain popul@@ ation ."
"For in@@ stance , you could find women who feel &quot; &quot; ad@@ di@@ cted &quot; &quot; in their 20@@ s when it was cl@@ ou@@ dy in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h ."
( Laughter ) But I &apos;ll sp@@ are you that .
So here are some of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te mon@@ t@@ ages that have been colle@@ cted : &quot; I feel so much of my d@@ ad ali@@ ve in me that there isn &apos;t even room for me . &quot;
&quot; I feel very lon@@ ely . &quot;
&quot; &quot; I need to be in some back@@ wo@@ ods re@@ d@@ ne@@ ck tow@@ n so that I can feel beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel in@@ visi@@ ble to you . &quot;
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t hi@@ de it if society didn &apos;t make me feel like I needed to . &quot;
&quot; I feel in love with C@@ a@@ rol@@ y@@ n . &quot; &quot; I feel so nau@@ gh@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I feel these we@@ ir@@ does are actually an as@@ set to colle@@ ge life . &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; I love how I feel today . &quot;
"So as you can see , We F@@ e@@ el F@@ ine uses a techni@@ qu@@ e that I call &quot; &quot; pas@@ sive obser@@ vation . &quot; &quot; What I mean by that is that it pas@@ si@@ vely obser@@ ves people as they live their lives . It sc@@ ans the world &apos;s blo@@ gs and looks at what people are writing , and these people don &apos;t know they &apos;re being wat@@ ched or inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ed ."
"And because of that , you end up getting very hon@@ est , can@@ did , sin@@ c@@ ere respon@@ ses that are often very moving ."
And this is a techni@@ qu@@ e that I usu@@ ally pre@@ f@@ er in my work because people don &apos;t know they &apos;re being inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ed .
"They &apos;re just living life , and they end up just ac@@ ting like that ."
A@@ no@@ ther techni@@ qu@@ e is dire@@ ct@@ ly questi@@ on@@ ing people .
"And this is a techni@@ qu@@ e that I ex@@ plo@@ red in a different project , the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o ! Ti@@ me C@@ ap@@ su@@ le , which was desig@@ ned to take a fin@@ ger@@ pr@@ int of the world in 200@@ 6 ."
"It was di@@ vi@@ ded into ten very simple the@@ mes — love , ang@@ er , s@@ ad@@ ness and so on — each of which con@@ ta@@ ined a single , very open@@ -@@ en@@ ded question put to the world : What do you love ? What makes you ang@@ ry ?"
What makes you sa@@ d ? What do you believe in ? And so on .
"The time cap@@ su@@ le was available for one mon@@ th on@@ line , trans@@ lated into 10 langu@@ ages , and this is what it looked like ."
"It &apos;s a sp@@ in@@ ning g@@ lo@@ be , the surface of which is enti@@ re@@ ly com@@ posed of the pi@@ ctures and words and d@@ raw@@ ings of people that sub@@ mi@@ t@@ ted to the time cap@@ su@@ le ."
The ten the@@ mes radi@@ ate out and or@@ bit the time cap@@ su@@ le .
You can si@@ ft through this data and see what people have sub@@ mi@@ t@@ ted .
"This is in respon@@ se to , What &apos;s beautiful ? &quot; &quot; M@@ is@@ s World . &quot; &quot; There are two mo@@ des to the time cap@@ su@@ le ."
"There &apos;s One World , which pre@@ sen@@ ts the sp@@ in@@ ning g@@ lo@@ be , and M@@ any V@@ o@@ i@@ ces , which sp@@ li@@ ts the data out into film stri@@ ps and le@@ ts you si@@ ft through them one by one ."
"So this project was pun@@ ctu@@ ated by a really amazing ev@@ ent , which was he@@ ld in the des@@ er@@ t outside Al@@ bu@@ qu@@ er@@ qu@@ e in New M@@ exi@@ co at the Je@@ me@@ z P@@ u@@ e@@ bl@@ o , where for three con@@ secu@@ tive ni@@ ghts , the cont@@ ents of the cap@@ su@@ le were proje@@ cted on@@ to the si@@ des of the an@@ cient R@@ ed Ro@@ ck C@@ any@@ on wal@@ ls , which stand about 2@@ 00 fe@@ et t@@ all . It was really incredible ."
And we also proje@@ cted the cont@@ ents of the time cap@@ su@@ le as bin@@ ary c@@ od@@ e using a 3@@ 5@@ -@@ wat@@ t las@@ er into ou@@ ter space .
"You can see the or@@ ange line lea@@ ving the des@@ er@@ t flo@@ or at about a 4@@ 5 de@@ gre@@ e ang@@ le there . This was amazing because the first night I looked at all this information and really started seeing the g@@ ap@@ s that I tal@@ ked about ear@@ lie@@ r — the differ@@ ences in age , gen@@ der and we@@ alth and so on ."
"But , you know , as I looked at this more and more and more , and saw these images go across the ro@@ cks , I realized I was seeing the same ar@@ che@@ typ@@ al ev@@ ents de@@ pi@@ cted again and again and again ."
"You know : we@@ dd@@ ings , bir@@ ths , fun@@ er@@ als , the first car , the first k@@ is@@ s , the first cam@@ el or hor@@ se — depen@@ ding on the culture ."
"And it was really moving . And this picture here was taken the fin@@ al night from a di@@ st@@ ant cli@@ ff about two miles away , where the cont@@ ents of the cap@@ su@@ le were being be@@ am@@ ed into space ."
And there was something very moving about all of this human ex@@ pres@@ sion being sh@@ ot off into the night sk@@ y .
"And it started to make me think a lot about the night sk@@ y , and how hum@@ ans have always used the night sk@@ y to project their great stories ."
"You know , as a child in V@@ er@@ mon@@ t , on a far@@ m where I gre@@ w up , I would often look up into the dar@@ k sk@@ y and see the three st@@ ar be@@ l@@ t of O@@ ri@@ on , the H@@ un@@ ter ."
"And as an ad@@ ul@@ t , I &apos;ve been more aw@@ are of the great Gre@@ ek my@@ ths playing out in the sk@@ y over@@ head every night ."
"You know , O@@ ri@@ on fac@@ ing the ro@@ aring bu@@ ll ."
P@@ er@@ se@@ us fl@@ ying to the re@@ s@@ cu@@ e of An@@ dro@@ me@@ da .
Z@@ e@@ us bat@@ t@@ ling Ch@@ ro@@ no@@ s for control of M@@ oun@@ t O@@ ly@@ m@@ pu@@ s .
"I mean , these are the great tal@@ es of the Gre@@ e@@ ks ."
And it ca@@ used me to won@@ der about our world today .
"And it ca@@ used me to won@@ der speci@@ fi@@ cally , if we could make new con@@ st@@ el@@ l@@ ations today , what would those look like ? What would those be ?"
"If we could make new pi@@ ctures in the sk@@ y , what would we dra@@ w ?"
What are the great stories of today ?
"And those are the questions that inspi@@ red my new project , which is de@@ bu@@ ting here today at TED ."
"N@@ ob@@ ody &apos;s seen this yet , publi@@ c@@ ly ."
It &apos;s called Uni@@ verse : R@@ ev@@ e@@ al@@ ing O@@ ur M@@ od@@ er@@ n M@@ y@@ th@@ o@@ logy .
And it uses this me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or of an inter@@ ac@@ tive night sk@@ y .
"So , it &apos;s my great ple@@ as@@ ure now to show this to you ."
"So , Uni@@ verse will open here ."
"And you &apos;ll see that it le@@ ads with a shi@@ f@@ ting st@@ ar fie@@ ld , and there &apos;s an Au@@ ro@@ ra B@@ ore@@ al@@ is in the back@@ ground , kind of mor@@ ph@@ ing with color . The color of the Au@@ ro@@ ra B@@ ore@@ al@@ is can be contro@@ l@@ led using this single b@@ ar of color at the bot@@ tom , and we &apos;ll put it down here to red ."
So you see this kind of — these star@@ s moving along .
"Now , these ar@@ en &apos;t just little poin@@ ts of light , little pi@@ x@@ els ."
"E@@ ach of those star@@ s actually re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts a speci@@ fic ev@@ ent in the real world — a quot@@ e that was st@@ ated by somebody , an image , a news story , a person , a company . You know , some kind of her@@ o@@ ic per@@ son@@ ality ."
"And you might noti@@ ce that as the cur@@ s@@ or begin@@ s to tou@@ ch some of these star@@ s , that sha@@ p@@ es beg@@ in to em@@ er@@ ge ."
"We see here there &apos;s a little man wal@@ king along , or maybe a woman ."
And we see here a photogra@@ ph with a head .
You can start to see words em@@ er@@ g@@ ing here .
And those are the con@@ st@@ el@@ l@@ ations of today .
"And I can turn them all on , and you can see them moving across the sk@@ y now ."
"This is the universe of 200@@ 7 , the last two months ."
The data from this is global news co@@ ver@@ age from thousands of news sources around the world .
"It &apos;s using the A@@ P@@ I of a really great company that I work with in New York , actually , called D@@ a@@ y@@ life ."
And it &apos;s kind of the ze@@ it@@ ge@@ i@@ st view at this level of the world &apos;s cur@@ r@@ ent my@@ th@@ o@@ logy over the last couple of months .
"So we can see where it &apos;s em@@ er@@ g@@ ing here , like P@@ resi@@ dent F@@ or@@ d , I@@ ra@@ q , B@@ us@@ h . And we can actually is@@ ol@@ ate just the words — I call them se@@ cre@@ ts — and we can cause them to form an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ tical li@@ st . And we see An@@ na Ni@@ co@@ le S@@ mi@@ th playing a big ro@@ le re@@ cent@@ ly ."
P@@ resi@@ dent F@@ or@@ d — this is G@@ er@@ al@@ d F@@ or@@ d &apos;s fun@@ er@@ al .
"We can actually cli@@ ck anything in Uni@@ verse and have it become the cen@@ ter of the universe , and everything else will enter its or@@ bit ."
"So , we &apos;ll cli@@ ck F@@ or@@ d , and now that be@@ comes the cen@@ ter ."
And the things that rel@@ ate to F@@ or@@ d enter its or@@ bit and s@@ wi@@ r@@ l around it .
"We can is@@ ol@@ ate just the photograph@@ s , and we now see those ."
We can cli@@ ck on one of those and have the photogra@@ ph be the cen@@ ter of the universe .
Now the things that rel@@ ate to it are s@@ wi@@ r@@ ling around .
We can cli@@ ck on this and we see this i@@ con@@ ic image of Be@@ t@@ ty F@@ or@@ d k@@ is@@ sing her h@@ us@@ b@@ and &apos;s co@@ f@@ f@@ in .
"In Uni@@ verse , there &apos;s kind of no end . It just goes in@@ fini@@ tely , and you can just kind of cli@@ ck on stuff ."
"This is a photogra@@ phi@@ c re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation , called S@@ na@@ p@@ sh@@ ots ."
But we can actually be more speci@@ fic in de@@ fin@@ ing our universe .
"So , if we want to , let &apos;s che@@ ck out what Bi@@ ll C@@ lin@@ ton &apos;s universe looks like ."
"And let &apos;s see , in the past week , what he &apos;s been up to ."
"So now , we have a new universe , which is just con@@ stra@@ ined to all things Bi@@ ll C@@ lin@@ ton ."
We can have his con@@ st@@ el@@ l@@ ations em@@ er@@ ge here .
"We can pu@@ ll out his se@@ cre@@ ts , and we see that it has a lot to do with can@@ di@@ d@@ ates , H@@ il@@ lar@@ y , pre@@ si@@ den@@ tial , Bar@@ ack O@@ b@@ ama ."
We can see the stories that Bi@@ ll C@@ lin@@ ton is taking part in right now .
A@@ ny of those can be open@@ ed up .
So we see O@@ b@@ ama and the C@@ lin@@ t@@ ons me@@ et in Al@@ ab@@ ama .
"You can see that this is an important story ; there are a lot of things in its or@@ bit . If we open this up , we get different perspe@@ cti@@ ves on this story ."
You can cli@@ ck any of those to go out and read the arti@@ cle at the source . This one &apos;s from A@@ l J@@ az@@ e@@ era .
"We can also see the super@@ star@@ s . These would be the people that are kind of the lo@@ om@@ ing her@@ o@@ es and her@@ o@@ ines in the universe of Bi@@ ll C@@ lin@@ ton . So there &apos;s Bi@@ ll C@@ lin@@ ton , H@@ il@@ lar@@ y , I@@ ra@@ q , G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h , Bar@@ ack O@@ b@@ ama , S@@ co@@ ot@@ er Li@@ b@@ by — these are kind of the people of Bi@@ ll C@@ lin@@ ton ."
"We can also see a world ma@@ p , so this shows us the ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c re@@ ach of Bi@@ ll C@@ lin@@ ton in the last week or so ."
"We can see he &apos;s been fo@@ c@@ used in America because he &apos;s been cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ning , probably , but a little bit of action over here in the Mi@@ ddle E@@ ast ."
And then we can also see a ti@@ me@@ line .
"So we see that he was a bit qu@@ ie@@ t on S@@ atur@@ day , but he was back to work on S@@ un@@ day morning , and actually been ta@@ per@@ ing off since then this week ."
"And it &apos;s not li@@ mi@@ ted to just people or d@@ ates , but we can actually put in con@@ cep@@ ts also ."
"So if I put in clim@@ ate change for all of 200@@ 6 , we &apos;ll see what that universe looks like ."
Here we have our st@@ ar fie@@ ld . Here we have our sha@@ p@@ es .
Here we have our se@@ cre@@ ts .
"So we see again , clim@@ ate change is large : Na@@ i@@ robi , global con@@ fer@@ ence , environ@@ ment@@ al ."
"And there are also quot@@ es that you can see , if you &apos;re interested in re@@ ading about quot@@ es on clim@@ ate change ."
"You know , this is really an in@@ fini@@ te thing ."
"The super@@ star@@ s of clim@@ ate change in 200@@ 6 : United States , Bri@@ tain , China . You know , these are the tow@@ ering countries that kind of def@@ ine this con@@ cept ."
So this is a piece that de@@ man@@ ds expl@@ or@@ ation .
"This will be on@@ line in se@@ ver@@ al days , probably next T@@ u@@ es@@ day ."
And you &apos;ll all be able to use it and kind of expl@@ ore what your own per@@ s@@ onal my@@ th@@ o@@ logy might be .
"You &apos;ll noti@@ ce that in D@@ a@@ y@@ life — rather , in Uni@@ verse — it sup@@ por@@ ts both the noti@@ on of a global my@@ th@@ o@@ logy , which is re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted by something as bro@@ ad as , say , 200@@ 7 , and also a per@@ s@@ onal my@@ th@@ o@@ logy ."
"As you sear@@ ch for the things that are important to you in your world , and then see what the con@@ st@@ el@@ l@@ ations of those might look like ."
So it &apos;s been a ple@@ as@@ ure . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"In half a century of trying to help pre@@ v@@ ent war@@ s , there &apos;s one question that never lea@@ ves me : How do we deal with extre@@ me violence without using force in re@@ turn ?"
"When you &apos;re fac@@ ed with bru@@ t@@ ality , whether it &apos;s a child fac@@ ing a bu@@ lly on a pla@@ y@@ ground or dom@@ esti@@ c violence — or , on the stre@@ ets of Sy@@ ri@@ a today , fac@@ ing tan@@ ks and sh@@ ra@@ p@@ ne@@ l , what &apos;s the most effe@@ ctive thing to do ?"
F@@ ight back ? G@@ i@@ ve in ?
U@@ se more force ?
This question : &quot; &quot; How do I deal with a bu@@ lly without be@@ coming a th@@ u@@ g in re@@ turn ? &quot; &quot; has been with me ever since I was a child .
"I remember I was about 1@@ 3 , g@@ lu@@ ed to a gra@@ iny black and white tele@@ vision in my parents &apos; living room as S@@ o@@ vie@@ t tan@@ ks rol@@ led into Bu@@ d@@ ap@@ est , and kids not much ol@@ der than me were th@@ row@@ ing themselves at the tan@@ ks and getting m@@ own down ."
And I rus@@ h@@ ed up@@ sta@@ ir@@ s and started pac@@ king my su@@ it@@ case .
"And my mother came up and said , &quot; &quot; What on Earth are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to Bu@@ d@@ ap@@ est . &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; What on Earth for ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; K@@ i@@ ds are getting kil@@ led there ."
"There &apos;s something terri@@ ble happening . &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t be so sil@@ ly . &quot; &quot; And I started to c@@ ry ."
"And she got it , she said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , I see it &apos;s seri@@ ous ."
You &apos;re much too young to help .
You need tra@@ ining . I &apos;ll help you .
But just un@@ p@@ ack your su@@ it@@ case . &quot; &quot; And so I got some tra@@ ining and went and worked in Africa during most of my 20@@ s .
But I realized that what I really needed to know I couldn &apos;t get from tra@@ ining cour@@ ses .
"I wanted to understand how violence , how op@@ pres@@ sion , works ."
And what I &apos;ve disco@@ vered since is this : Bu@@ ll@@ ies use violence in three ways .
"They use poli@@ tical violence to in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ate , physi@@ cal violence to ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ ze and ment@@ al or emoti@@ onal violence to under@@ m@@ ine ."
And only very r@@ are@@ ly in very few c@@ ases does it work to use more violence .
"N@@ el@@ son M@@ an@@ de@@ la went to ja@@ il belie@@ ving in violence , and 2@@ 7 years later he and his colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es had s@@ low@@ ly and car@@ e@@ fully hon@@ ed the sk@@ il@@ ls , the incredible sk@@ il@@ ls , that they needed to turn one of the most vi@@ ci@@ ous govern@@ ments the world has known into a de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y ."
And they did it in a tot@@ al de@@ v@@ oti@@ on to n@@ on-@@ violence .
They realized that using force against force doesn &apos;t work .
So what does work ?
O@@ ver time I &apos;ve colle@@ cted about a hal@@ f-@@ do@@ z@@ en meth@@ ods that do work — of course there are many more — that do work and that are effe@@ ctive .
"And the first is that the change that has to take place has to take place here , inside me ."
"It &apos;s my respon@@ se , my at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , to op@@ pres@@ sion that I &apos;ve got control over , and that I can do something about ."
And what I need to develo@@ p is self-@@ know@@ le@@ dge to do that .
"That means I need to know how I ti@@ ck , when I col@@ lap@@ se , where my for@@ mi@@ d@@ able poin@@ ts are , where my we@@ ak@@ er poin@@ ts are ."
When do I give in ?
What will I stand up for ?
And medi@@ tation or self-@@ in@@ spe@@ ction is one of the ways — again it &apos;s not the only one — it &apos;s one of the ways of ga@@ ining this kind of in@@ ner power .
And my her@@ o@@ ine here — like S@@ ati@@ sh &apos;s — is A@@ ung S@@ an Su@@ u K@@ y@@ i in Bu@@ r@@ ma .
She was le@@ ading a group of students on a prote@@ st in the stre@@ ets of R@@ an@@ go@@ on .
They came around a cor@@ ner fac@@ ed with a row of mach@@ ine g@@ un@@ s .
And she realized stra@@ ight away that the sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s with their fin@@ g@@ ers sha@@ king on the tri@@ gg@@ ers were more sc@@ ared than the stud@@ ent prote@@ st@@ ers behind her .
But she told the students to si@@ t down .
"And she wal@@ ked forward with such cal@@ m and such c@@ lar@@ ity and such tot@@ al l@@ ack of fe@@ ar that she could walk right up to the first gu@@ n , put her hand on it and low@@ er it ."
And no one got kil@@ led .
"So that &apos;s what the ma@@ st@@ ery of fe@@ ar can do — not only fac@@ ed with mach@@ ine g@@ un@@ s , but if you me@@ et a k@@ ni@@ fe fi@@ ght in the stre@@ et ."
But we have to prac@@ ti@@ ce .
So what about our fe@@ ar ?
I have a little man@@ tra .
My fe@@ ar grow@@ s f@@ at on the energy I fe@@ ed it .
And if it grow@@ s very big it probably happens .
"So we all know the three o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the morning syn@@ dro@@ me , when something you &apos;ve been wor@@ ry@@ ing about wa@@ k@@ es you up — I see a lot of people — and for an hour you to@@ ss and turn , it gets wor@@ se and wor@@ se , and by four o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck you &apos;re p@@ in@@ ned to the pi@@ l@@ low by a mon@@ ster this big ."
"The only thing to do is to get up , make a cu@@ p of te@@ a and si@@ t down with the fe@@ ar like a child be@@ side you ."
You &apos;re the ad@@ ul@@ t .
The fe@@ ar is the child .
"And you talk to the fe@@ ar and you ask it what it wan@@ ts , what it needs ."
How can this be made better ?
How can the child feel stron@@ ger ?
And you make a pl@@ an .
"And you say , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , now we &apos;re going back to sle@@ ep ."
"H@@ al@@ f-@@ past seven , we &apos;re getting up and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do . &quot; &quot; I had one of these 3 a@@ .@@ m@@ . epi@@ so@@ des on S@@ un@@ day — par@@ al@@ y@@ zed with fe@@ ar at coming to talk to you ."
( Laughter ) So I did the thing .
"I got up , made the cu@@ p of te@@ a , s@@ at down with it , did it all and I &apos;m here — still par@@ tly par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , but I &apos;m here ."
( Applause ) So that &apos;s fe@@ ar . What about ang@@ er ?
Wh@@ er@@ ever there is in@@ ju@@ sti@@ ce there &apos;s ang@@ er .
"But ang@@ er is like g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine , and if you spra@@ y it around and somebody li@@ ghts a mat@@ ch , you &apos;ve got an in@@ fer@@ no ."
But ang@@ er as an eng@@ ine — in an eng@@ ine — is powerful .
"If we can put our ang@@ er inside an eng@@ ine , it can dri@@ ve us forward , it can get us through the dre@@ ad@@ ful mom@@ ents and it can give us real in@@ ner power ."
And I learned this in my work with nuclear we@@ apo@@ n poli@@ cy@@ -@@ mak@@ ers .
Because at the beginning I was so ou@@ tra@@ g@@ ed at the d@@ ang@@ ers they were ex@@ pos@@ ing us to that I just wanted to ar@@ gu@@ e and bl@@ ame and make them wrong .
T@@ ot@@ ally in@@ effe@@ ctive .
In order to develo@@ p a di@@ al@@ og@@ ue for change we have to deal with our ang@@ er .
It &apos;s o@@ kay to be ang@@ ry with the thing — the nuclear we@@ apo@@ ns in this case — but it is hop@@ el@@ ess to be ang@@ ry with the people .
They are human be@@ ings just like us .
And they &apos;re doing what they think is best .
And that &apos;s the basi@@ s on which we have to talk with them .
"So that &apos;s the third one , ang@@ er ."
"And it br@@ ings me to the c@@ ru@@ x of what &apos;s going on , or what I per@@ cei@@ ve as going on , in the world today , which is that last century was top@@ -@@ down power ."
It was still govern@@ ments tel@@ ling people what to do .
This century there &apos;s a shi@@ ft .
It &apos;s bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up or gra@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ots power .
It &apos;s like mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms coming through con@@ cre@@ te .
"It &apos;s people jo@@ ining up with people , as B@@ un@@ dy just said , miles away to bring about change ."
And Pe@@ ace D@@ i@@ re@@ ct spo@@ t@@ ted quite early on that local people in are@@ as of very ho@@ t con@@ fli@@ ct know what to do .
They know best what to do .
So Pe@@ ace D@@ i@@ re@@ ct gets behind them to do that .
"And the kind of thing they &apos;re doing is demo@@ bi@@ liz@@ ing mili@@ ti@@ as , re@@ building econom@@ ies , re@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ ling re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , even li@@ ber@@ ating child sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s ."
And they have to ri@@ sk their lives almost every day to do this .
"And what they &apos;ve realized is that using violence in the situ@@ ations they oper@@ ate in is not only less hum@@ ane , but it &apos;s less effe@@ ctive than using meth@@ ods that conne@@ ct people with people , that re@@ build ."
And I think that the U.@@ S. mi@@ lit@@ ary is finally beginning to get this .
"U@@ p to now their coun@@ ter@@ -@@ ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sm poli@@ cy has been to ki@@ ll in@@ sur@@ g@@ ents at almost any cost , and if ci@@ vi@@ li@@ ans get in the way , that &apos;s wri@@ t@@ ten as &quot; &quot; col@@ lat@@ er@@ al dam@@ age . &quot; &quot; And this is so in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating and hu@@ mili@@ ating for the popul@@ ation of Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , that it makes the re@@ c@@ ru@@ it@@ ment for al@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a very e@@ asy , when people are so dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ed by , for example , the bur@@ ning of the K@@ or@@ an ."
So the tra@@ ining of the tro@@ op@@ s has to change .
And I think there are sig@@ ns that it is beginning to change .
The Bri@@ ti@@ sh mi@@ lit@@ ary have always been much better at this .
"But there is one mag@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent example for them to take their cu@@ e from , and that &apos;s a bri@@ lli@@ ant U.@@ S. lie@@ u@@ ten@@ ant col@@ on@@ el called Ch@@ ris H@@ u@@ gh@@ es ."
"And he was le@@ ading his men down the stre@@ ets of N@@ aj@@ a@@ f — in I@@ ra@@ q actually — and sud@@ den@@ ly people were po@@ ur@@ ing out of the h@@ ous@@ es on either side of the ro@@ ad , scre@@ am@@ ing , y@@ el@@ ling , fu@@ ri@@ ously ang@@ ry , and sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded these very young tro@@ op@@ s who were completely terri@@ f@@ ied , didn &apos;t know what was going on , couldn &apos;t speak A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ."
"And Ch@@ ris H@@ u@@ gh@@ es stro@@ de into the mi@@ ddle of the th@@ rong with his we@@ apo@@ n ab@@ o@@ ve his head , poin@@ ting at the ground , and he said , &quot; &quot; K@@ ne@@ el . &quot; &quot; And these huge sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s with their back@@ pac@@ ks and their body ar@@ mo@@ r , w@@ ob@@ b@@ led to the ground ."
And comple@@ te sil@@ ence fe@@ ll .
"And after about two minutes , everybody mo@@ ved a@@ side and went home ."
Now that to me is wi@@ s@@ dom in action .
"In the moment , that &apos;s what he did ."
And it &apos;s happening every@@ where now .
You don &apos;t believe me ?
Ha@@ ve you asked your@@ selves why and how so many di@@ ct@@ at@@ or@@ ships have col@@ lap@@ sed over the last 30 years ?
"D@@ i@@ ct@@ at@@ or@@ ships in C@@ ze@@ cho@@ s@@ lo@@ v@@ ak@@ ia , E@@ ast G@@ er@@ many , E@@ st@@ on@@ ia , L@@ at@@ vi@@ a , Li@@ th@@ u@@ ania , M@@ ali , M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ car , P@@ ol@@ and , the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines , S@@ er@@ bi@@ a , S@@ lo@@ v@@ enia , I could go on , and now T@@ uni@@ si@@ a and E@@ g@@ y@@ pt ."
And this ha@@ sn &apos;t just happened .
"A lot of it is du@@ e to a book wri@@ t@@ ten by an 8@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old man in B@@ ost@@ on , G@@ ene S@@ har@@ p ."
He wro@@ te a book called &quot; &quot; F@@ ro@@ m D@@ i@@ ct@@ at@@ or@@ ship to De@@ moc@@ rac@@ y &quot; &quot; with 8@@ 1 meth@@ od@@ o@@ log@@ ies for n@@ on-@@ viol@@ ent resi@@ stance .
And it &apos;s been trans@@ lated into 2@@ 6 langu@@ ages .
It &apos;s f@@ low@@ n around the world .
"And it &apos;s being used by young people and ol@@ der people every@@ where , because it works and it &apos;s effe@@ ctive ."
"So this is what gi@@ ves me hope — not just hope , this is what makes me feel very posi@@ tive right now ."
Because finally human be@@ ings are getting it .
"We &apos;re getting prac@@ tical , do@@ able meth@@ od@@ o@@ log@@ ies to answer my question : How do we deal with a bu@@ lly without be@@ coming a th@@ u@@ g ?"
"We &apos;re using the kind of sk@@ il@@ ls that I &apos;ve out@@ lin@@ ed : in@@ ner power — the develo@@ pment of in@@ ner power — through self-@@ know@@ le@@ dge , re@@ cogni@@ z@@ ing and working with our fe@@ ar , using ang@@ er as a fu@@ el , co@@ oper@@ ating with others , ban@@ ding together with others , cou@@ ra@@ ge , and most import@@ an@@ tly , com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment to ac@@ tive n@@ on-@@ violence ."
Now I don &apos;t just believe in n@@ on-@@ violence .
I don &apos;t have to believe in it .
I see evi@@ dence every@@ where of how it works .
"And I see that we , ordin@@ ary people , can do what A@@ ung S@@ an Su@@ u K@@ y@@ i and G@@ hand@@ i and M@@ an@@ de@@ la did ."
We can bring to an end the blo@@ od@@ ie@@ st century that hum@@ ani@@ ty has ever known .
And we can organi@@ ze to over@@ come op@@ pres@@ sion by open@@ ing our hear@@ ts as well as str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening this incredible re@@ sol@@ ve .
And this open@@ -@@ hear@@ te@@ d@@ ness is exactly what I &apos;ve exper@@ ien@@ ced in the entire organiz@@ ation of this ga@@ ther@@ ing since I got here y@@ est@@ er@@ day .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Ha@@ ve you ever wonder@@ ed what is inside your d@@ ent@@ al pla@@ qu@@ e ?
"P@@ rob@@ ably not , but people like me do ."
"I &apos;m an ar@@ che@@ ologi@@ cal gen@@ e@@ ti@@ ci@@ st at the C@@ enter for E@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary Me@@ di@@ cine at the Uni@@ versity of Z@@ u@@ ri@@ ch , and I study the ori@@ gin@@ s and ev@@ olution of human health and dise@@ ase by con@@ du@@ cting gen@@ e@@ tic research on the sk@@ ele@@ tal and mu@@ m@@ mi@@ f@@ ied re@@ ma@@ ins of an@@ cient hum@@ ans ."
"And through this work , I hope to better understand the ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary v@@ ul@@ ner@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies of our bod@@ ies , so that we can impro@@ ve and better man@@ age our health in the future ."
"There are different ways to appro@@ ach ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary medi@@ cine , and one way is to ex@@ trac@@ t human DNA from an@@ cient b@@ ones ."
"And from these ex@@ trac@@ ts , we can re@@ con@@ stru@@ ct the human gen@@ ome at different poin@@ ts in time and look for chang@@ es that might be re@@ lated to ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ations , ri@@ sk fac@@ t@@ ors and in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted dise@@ ases ."
But this is only one half of the story .
"The most important health challen@@ ges today are not ca@@ used by simple mu@@ t@@ ations in our gen@@ ome , but rather resul@@ t from a comple@@ x and dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c inter@@ play between gen@@ e@@ tic v@@ ari@@ ation , d@@ ie@@ t , micro@@ be@@ s and par@@ a@@ si@@ tes and our im@@ mu@@ ne respon@@ se ."
All of these dise@@ ases have a stron@@ g ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary com@@ pon@@ ent that dire@@ ct@@ ly re@@ lat@@ es to the fact that we live today in a very different environment than the ones in which our bod@@ ies ev@@ olved .
"And in order to understand these dise@@ ases , we need to move past stud@@ ies of the human gen@@ ome alone and towar@@ ds a more ho@@ li@@ stic appro@@ ach to human health in the past ."
But there are a lot of challen@@ ges for this .
"And first of all , what do we even study ?"
S@@ k@@ ele@@ t@@ ons are u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ; they &apos;re found all over the place .
"But of course , all of the so@@ ft ti@@ s@@ su@@ e has de@@ com@@ posed , and the sk@@ ele@@ ton itself has li@@ mi@@ ted health information ."
"M@@ um@@ mie@@ s are a great source of information , ex@@ cept that they &apos;re really ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cally li@@ mi@@ ted and li@@ mi@@ ted in time as well ."
"C@@ o@@ pro@@ li@@ tes are f@@ os@@ si@@ liz@@ ed human fe@@ ces , and they &apos;re actually extre@@ me@@ ly interesting ."
"You can learn a lot about an@@ cient d@@ ie@@ t and inte@@ st@@ in@@ al dise@@ ase , but they are very r@@ are ."
"( Laughter ) So to ad@@ dre@@ ss this problem , I put together a team of inter@@ national resear@@ ch@@ ers in S@@ wit@@ zer@@ land , D@@ en@@ mar@@ k and the U.@@ K@@ ."
"@@ to study a very po@@ or@@ ly stud@@ ied , little known materi@@ al that &apos;s found on people every@@ where ."
It &apos;s a ty@@ pe of f@@ os@@ si@@ liz@@ ed d@@ ent@@ al pla@@ qu@@ e that is called offi@@ cially d@@ ent@@ al cal@@ cu@@ lu@@ s .
M@@ any of you may know it by the ter@@ m tar@@ t@@ ar .
It &apos;s what the den@@ ti@@ st cle@@ ans off your te@@ e@@ th every time that you go in for a visi@@ t .
"And in a ty@@ pi@@ cal den@@ ti@@ stry visi@@ t , you may have about 15 to 30 mi@@ lli@@ gra@@ ms re@@ mo@@ ved ."
"But in an@@ cient times before to@@ ot@@ h br@@ us@@ h@@ ing , up to 6@@ 00 mi@@ lli@@ gra@@ ms might have built up on the te@@ e@@ th over a li@@ fe@@ time ."
"And what &apos;s really important about d@@ ent@@ al cal@@ cu@@ lu@@ s is that it f@@ os@@ si@@ liz@@ es just like the rest of the sk@@ ele@@ ton , it &apos;s ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant in qu@@ anti@@ ty before the present day and it &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
We find it in every popul@@ ation around the world at all time per@@ i@@ ods going back ten@@ s of thousands of years .
And we even find it in ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als and animals .
And so pre@@ vi@@ ous stud@@ ies had only fo@@ c@@ used on micro@@ sc@@ op@@ y .
"They &apos;d looked at d@@ ent@@ al cal@@ cu@@ lu@@ s under a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e , and what they had found was things like pol@@ le@@ n and pl@@ ant star@@ ch@@ es , and they &apos;d found mus@@ cle cells from ani@@ mal me@@ ats and bac@@ ter@@ ia ."
"And so what my team of resear@@ ch@@ ers , what we wanted to do , is say , can we app@@ ly gen@@ e@@ tic and prote@@ om@@ ic technology to go after DNA and prote@@ ins , and from this can we get better ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ ic re@@ solution to really understand what &apos;s going on ?"
And what we found is that we can find many com@@ men@@ s@@ al and pa@@ th@@ og@@ eni@@ c bac@@ ter@@ ia that in@@ ha@@ bi@@ ted the na@@ s@@ al pas@@ s@@ ages and m@@ outh .
We also have found im@@ mu@@ ne prote@@ ins re@@ lated to in@@ fe@@ ction and in@@ fl@@ am@@ m@@ ation and prote@@ ins and DNA re@@ lated to d@@ ie@@ t .
"But what was sur@@ pri@@ sing to us , and also quite exci@@ ting , is we also found bac@@ ter@@ ia that nor@@ m@@ ally in@@ ha@@ bit u@@ pp@@ er re@@ sp@@ ir@@ at@@ ory systems ."
"So it gi@@ ves us vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al ac@@ cess to the lu@@ n@@ gs , which is where many important dise@@ ases re@@ side ."
And we also found bac@@ ter@@ ia that nor@@ m@@ ally in@@ ha@@ bit the gu@@ t .
"And so we can also now vi@@ r@@ tually ga@@ in ac@@ cess to this even more di@@ st@@ ant or@@ g@@ an system that , from the sk@@ ele@@ ton alone , has long de@@ com@@ posed ."
"And so by ap@@ pl@@ ying an@@ cient DNA sequ@@ en@@ cing and prote@@ in mas@@ s spe@@ c@@ tro@@ me@@ try technolog@@ ies to an@@ cient d@@ ent@@ al cal@@ cu@@ lu@@ s , we can gener@@ ate im@@ men@@ se qu@@ anti@@ ties of data that then we can use to beg@@ in to re@@ con@@ stru@@ ct a de@@ ta@@ i@@ led picture of the dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c inter@@ play between d@@ ie@@ t , in@@ fe@@ ction and im@@ muni@@ ty thousands of years ago ."
"So what started out as an idea , is now being im@@ ple@@ men@@ ted to ch@@ ur@@ n out mi@@ llions of sequ@@ ences that we can use to inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ate the lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary history of human health and dise@@ ase , right down to the gen@@ e@@ tic c@@ od@@ e of individu@@ al pa@@ th@@ og@@ ens ."
And from this information we can learn about how pa@@ th@@ og@@ ens ev@@ ol@@ ve and also why they contin@@ ue to make us si@@ ck .
And I hope I have con@@ v@@ in@@ ced you of the val@@ ue of d@@ ent@@ al cal@@ cu@@ lu@@ s .
"And as a fin@@ al par@@ ting thought , on be@@ half of future ar@@ che@@ ologi@@ sts , I would like to ask you to ple@@ ase think t@@ wi@@ ce before you go home and br@@ us@@ h your te@@ e@@ th ."
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"Th@@ ank you very much , Ch@@ ris . E@@ very@@ body who came up here said they were sc@@ ared . I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m sc@@ ared , but this is my first time of ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sing an audience like this ."
And I don &apos;t have any s@@ mar@@ t technology for you to look at .
"There are no sli@@ des , so you &apos;ll just have to be cont@@ ent with me ."
( Laughter ) What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa .
"A@@ l@@ ready this morning there were some al@@ lu@@ sions to the Africa that you hear about all the time : the Africa of HIV / AIDS , the Africa of mal@@ ar@@ ia , the Africa of po@@ ver@@ ty , the Africa of con@@ fli@@ ct , and the Africa of disa@@ st@@ ers ."
"W@@ hi@@ le it is true that those things are going on , there &apos;s an Africa that you don &apos;t hear about very much ."
"And sometimes I &apos;m pu@@ z@@ z@@ led , and I ask myself why ."
"This is the Africa that is chang@@ ing , that Ch@@ ris al@@ lu@@ ded to ."
This is the Africa of opportunity .
This is the Africa where people want to take char@@ ge of their own fu@@ tu@@ res and their own de@@ st@@ in@@ ies .
And this is the Africa where people are looking for part@@ ner@@ ships to do this . That &apos;s what I want to talk about today .
And I want to start by tel@@ ling you a story about that change in Africa .
"O@@ n 1@@ 5@@ th of Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 200@@ 5 , M@@ r. D@@ ie@@ pre@@ y@@ e Al@@ am@@ ie@@ y@@ es@@ e@@ igh@@ a , a gover@@ no@@ r of one of the o@@ il@@ -@@ ri@@ ch st@@ ates of Nigeri@@ a , was ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed by the Lon@@ don Me@@ tro@@ po@@ lit@@ an Po@@ li@@ ce on a visi@@ t to Lon@@ don ."
He was ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed because there were trans@@ f@@ ers of eight million dollars that went into some d@@ or@@ m@@ ant ac@@ coun@@ ts that be@@ lon@@ g@@ ed to him and his family .
This ar@@ rest oc@@ cur@@ red because there was co@@ oper@@ ation between the Lon@@ don Me@@ tro@@ po@@ lit@@ an Po@@ li@@ ce and the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic and F@@ in@@ an@@ cial C@@ ri@@ mes C@@ om@@ mis@@ sion of Nigeri@@ a — led by one of our most able and cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous people : M@@ r. N@@ u@@ h@@ u Ri@@ bad@@ u .
Al@@ am@@ ie@@ y@@ es@@ e@@ igh@@ a was ar@@ ra@@ ig@@ ned in Lon@@ don .
"D@@ ue to some sli@@ p@@ -@@ u@@ ps , he man@@ aged to es@@ cape dre@@ s@@ sed as a woman and ran from Lon@@ don back to Nigeri@@ a where , ac@@ cor@@ ding to our con@@ stitu@@ tion , those in offi@@ ce as govern@@ ors , pre@@ si@@ dent — as in many countries — have im@@ muni@@ ty and cannot be pro@@ secu@@ ted . But what happened : people were so ou@@ tra@@ g@@ ed by this behavi@@ or that it was possible for his state le@@ gi@@ s@@ lat@@ ure to im@@ pe@@ ach him and get him out of offi@@ ce ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , Al@@ am@@ s — as we call him for shor@@ t — is in ja@@ il ."
This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer wil@@ ling to t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate cor@@ ru@@ ption from their le@@ ad@@ ers .
"This is a story about the fact that people want their re@@ sources man@@ aged pro@@ per@@ ly for their good , and not taken out to places where they &apos;ll b@@ en@@ ef@@ it just a few of the e@@ li@@ te ."
"And ther@@ e@@ fore , when you hear about the cor@@ ru@@ pt Africa — cor@@ ru@@ ption all the time — I want you to know that the people and the govern@@ ments are trying hard to fi@@ ght this in some of the countries , and that some suc@@ cess@@ es are em@@ er@@ g@@ ing ."
D@@ o@@ es it mean the problem is over ? The answer is no .
"There &apos;s still a long way to go , but that there &apos;s a will there ."
And that suc@@ cess@@ es are being chal@@ ked up on this very important fi@@ ght .
"So when you hear about cor@@ ru@@ ption , don &apos;t just feel that nothing is being done about this — that you can &apos;t oper@@ ate in any Afri@@ can country because of the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming cor@@ ru@@ ption . That is not the case ."
"There &apos;s a will to fi@@ ght , and in many countries , that fi@@ ght is on@@ going and is being won . In others , like m@@ ine , where there has been a long history of di@@ ct@@ at@@ or@@ ship in Nigeri@@ a , the fi@@ ght is on@@ going and we have a long way to go ."
But the tru@@ th of the matter is that this is going on .
"The resul@@ ts are show@@ ing : in@@ depen@@ dent mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing by the World B@@ ank and other organiz@@ ations show that in many in@@ stan@@ ces the tr@@ end is dow@@ n@@ war@@ ds in terms of cor@@ ru@@ ption , and govern@@ ance is impro@@ ving ."
A study by the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic C@@ om@@ mis@@ sion for Africa show@@ ed a clear tr@@ end up@@ war@@ ds in govern@@ ance in 2@@ 8 Afri@@ can countries .
And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of govern@@ ance .
"That is that people talk about cor@@ ru@@ ption , cor@@ ru@@ ption ."
All the time when they talk about it you im@@ medi@@ ately think about Africa .
"That &apos;s the image : Afri@@ can countries . But let me say this : if Al@@ am@@ s was able to ex@@ port eight million dollars into an ac@@ coun@@ t in Lon@@ don — if the other people who had taken money , est@@ im@@ ated at 20 to 40 billion now of develo@@ ping countries &apos; mon@@ ies sitting ab@@ ro@@ ad in the develo@@ ped countries — if they &apos;re able to do this , what is that ? Is that not cor@@ ru@@ ption ?"
"In this country , if you re@@ cei@@ ve sto@@ le@@ n go@@ ods , are you not pro@@ secu@@ ted ?"
"So when we talk about this kind of cor@@ ru@@ ption , let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the g@@ lo@@ be — where the money &apos;s going and what can be done to stop it ."
"I &apos;m working on an ini@@ ti@@ ative now , along with the World B@@ ank , on as@@ set re@@ co@@ very , trying to do what we can to get the mon@@ ies that have been taken ab@@ ro@@ ad — develo@@ ping countries &apos; mon@@ e@@ ys — to get that s@@ ent back ."
"Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back , it may be far more for some of these countries than all the a@@ id that is being put together ."
( Applause ) The second thing I want to talk about is the will for re@@ form .
"A@@ f@@ ri@@ cans , after — they &apos;re ti@@ red , we &apos;re ti@@ red of being the sub@@ je@@ ct of everybody &apos;s ch@@ ari@@ ty and care ."
"We are gr@@ ate@@ ful , but we know that we can take char@@ ge of our own de@@ st@@ in@@ ies if we have the will to re@@ form ."
And what is happening in many Afri@@ can countries now is a realiz@@ ation that no one can do it but us . We have to do it .
"We can in@@ vi@@ te part@@ n@@ ers who can sup@@ port us , but we have to start ."
"We have to re@@ form our econom@@ ies , change our le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship , become more de@@ moc@@ r@@ atic , be more open to change and to information ."
"And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the contin@@ ent , Nigeri@@ a ."
"In fact , if you &apos;re not in Nigeri@@ a , you &apos;re not in Africa ."
I want to tell you that .
"( Laughter ) One in four sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Afri@@ cans is Nigeri@@ an , and it has 1@@ 40 million dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c people — cha@@ oti@@ c people — but very interesting people . You &apos;ll never be bo@@ red . ( Laughter )"
What we started to do was to realize that we had to take char@@ ge and re@@ form ourselves .
"And with the sup@@ port of a lea@@ der who was wil@@ ling , at the time , to do the re@@ form@@ s , we put forward a com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sive re@@ form program , which we develo@@ ped ourselves ."
"N@@ ot the Inter@@ national M@@ on@@ et@@ ary F@@ u@@ nd . N@@ ot the World B@@ ank , where I worked for 2@@ 1 years and ro@@ se to be a vice pre@@ si@@ dent ."
No one can do it for you . You have to do it for yourself .
"We put together a program that would , one : get the state out of bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es it had nothing — it had no business being in ."
The state should not be in the business of produ@@ cing go@@ ods and ser@@ vi@@ ces because it &apos;s in@@ ef@@ fi@@ cient and in@@ compe@@ t@@ ent .
So we decided to pri@@ v@@ ati@@ ze many of our en@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses .
"( Applause ) We — as a resul@@ t , we decided to li@@ ber@@ ali@@ ze many of our marke@@ ts ."
"C@@ an you believe that pri@@ or to this re@@ form — which started at the end of 200@@ 3 , when I left W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton to go and take up the pos@@ t of F@@ in@@ ance M@@ in@@ ist@@ er — we had a tele@@ communi@@ c@@ ations company that was only able to develo@@ p 4@@ ,@@ 500 land@@ lin@@ es in its entire 3@@ 0-@@ year history ?"
( Laughter ) Ha@@ ving a tele@@ phone in my country was a huge lu@@ x@@ ury .
You couldn &apos;t get it . You had to bri@@ be .
You had to do everything to get your phone .
"When P@@ resi@@ dent O@@ bas@@ an@@ j@@ o sup@@ por@@ ted and la@@ un@@ ched the li@@ ber@@ aliz@@ ation of the tele@@ communi@@ c@@ ations se@@ ctor , we went from 4@@ ,@@ 500 land@@ lin@@ es to 3@@ 2 million G@@ S@@ M lin@@ es , and coun@@ ting ."
"N@@ ig@@ eri@@ a &apos;s tele@@ com@@ s market is the secon@@ d-@@ f@@ ast@@ est grow@@ ing in the world , after China . We are getting inv@@ est@@ ments of about a billion dollars a year in tele@@ com@@ s . And no@@ body know@@ s , ex@@ cept a few s@@ mar@@ t people ."
"( Laughter ) The s@@ mar@@ test one , first to come in , was the M@@ T@@ N company of S@@ outh Africa ."
"And in the three years that I was F@@ in@@ ance M@@ in@@ ist@@ er , they made an a@@ ver@@ age of 3@@ 60 million dollars prof@@ it per year ."
"@@ 3@@ 60 million in a market — in a country that is a po@@ or country , with an a@@ ver@@ age per ca@@ pi@@ ta in@@ come just under 500 dollars per ca@@ pi@@ ta ."
So the market is there .
"When they ke@@ pt this under w@@ ra@@ ps , but so@@ on others got to know ."
"N@@ ig@@ eri@@ ans themselves began to develo@@ p some wi@@ rel@@ ess tele@@ communi@@ c@@ ations comp@@ an@@ ies , and three or four others have come in ."
"But there &apos;s a huge market out there , and people don &apos;t know about it , or they don &apos;t want to know ."
So pri@@ v@@ ati@@ z@@ ation is one of the things we &apos;ve done .
The other thing we &apos;ve also done is to man@@ age our fin@@ an@@ ces better .
Because no@@ body &apos;s going to help you and sup@@ port you if you &apos;re not man@@ ag@@ ing your own fin@@ an@@ ces well .
"And Nigeri@@ a , with the oil se@@ ctor , had the re@@ pu@@ tation of being cor@@ ru@@ pt and not man@@ ag@@ ing its own public fin@@ an@@ ces well ."
So what did we try to do ? We in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced a fi@@ sc@@ al ru@@ le that de@@ -@@ lin@@ ked our bud@@ get from the oil pri@@ ce .
"Be@@ fore we used to just bud@@ get on whatever oil we bring in , because oil is the bi@@ ggest , most re@@ ven@@ u@@ e-@@ ear@@ ning se@@ ctor in the econom@@ y : 70 percent of our re@@ ven@@ u@@ es come from oil ."
"We de@@ -@@ lin@@ ked that , and once we did it , we began to bud@@ get at a pri@@ ce sli@@ gh@@ tly low@@ er than the oil pri@@ ce and sa@@ ve whatever was ab@@ o@@ ve that pri@@ ce ."
We didn &apos;t know we could pu@@ ll it off ; it was very contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al .
"But what it im@@ medi@@ ately did was that the vol@@ ati@@ lity that had been present in terms of our economic develo@@ pment — where , even if oil pri@@ ces were high , we would gro@@ w very f@@ ast ."
"When they c@@ ra@@ shed , we c@@ ra@@ shed ."
"And we could har@@ d@@ ly even pay anything , any s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies , in the econom@@ y ."
"That smo@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ ed out . We were able to sa@@ ve , just before I left , 2@@ 7 billion dollars . Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as — and this went to our re@@ ser@@ ves — when I ar@@ ri@@ ved in 200@@ 3 , we had seven billion dollars in re@@ ser@@ ves ."
"B@@ y the time I left , we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars . And as we speak now , we have about 40 billion dollars in re@@ ser@@ ves du@@ e to pro@@ per man@@ ag@@ ement of our fin@@ an@@ ces ."
"And that sho@@ res up our econom@@ y , makes it st@@ able ."
O@@ ur ex@@ change r@@ ate that used to flu@@ ctu@@ ate all the time is now fa@@ ir@@ ly st@@ able and being man@@ aged so that business people have a pre@@ di@@ ct@@ ability of pri@@ ces in the econom@@ y .
We brought in@@ fl@@ ation down from 2@@ 8 percent to about 11 percent .
And we had G@@ D@@ P gro@@ w from an a@@ ver@@ age of 2@@ .@@ 3 percent the pre@@ vi@@ ous dec@@ ade to about 6@@ .@@ 5 percent now .
So all the chang@@ es and re@@ form@@ s we were able to make have sh@@ own up in resul@@ ts that are meas@@ u@@ ra@@ ble in the econom@@ y .
"And what is more important , because we want to get away from oil and di@@ ver@@ si@@ fy — and there are so many opportuni@@ ties in this one big country , as in many countries in Africa — what was re@@ mark@@ able is that much of this grow@@ th came not from the oil se@@ ctor alone , but from n@@ on-@@ oil ."
A@@ g@@ ri@@ culture gre@@ w at better than eight percent .
"As tele@@ com@@ s se@@ ctor gre@@ w , h@@ ous@@ ing and con@@ stru@@ ction , and I could go on and on . And this is to il@@ lu@@ str@@ ate to you that once you get the m@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ econom@@ y stra@@ igh@@ ten@@ ed out , the opportuni@@ ties in v@@ ari@@ ous other se@@ ct@@ ors are en@@ or@@ m@@ ous ."
"We have opportuni@@ ties in agri@@ culture , like I said ."
"We have opportuni@@ ties in so@@ li@@ d min@@ er@@ als . We have a lot of min@@ er@@ als that no one has even inv@@ est@@ ed in or ex@@ plo@@ red . And we realized that without the pro@@ per le@@ gi@@ sl@@ ation to make that possible , that wouldn &apos;t happen . So we &apos;ve now got a min@@ ing c@@ od@@ e that is com@@ par@@ able with some of the best in the world ."
We have opportuni@@ ties in h@@ ous@@ ing and real est@@ ate .
There was nothing in a country of 1@@ 40 million people — no sh@@ op@@ ping mal@@ ls as you know them here .
This was an inv@@ est@@ ment opportunity for someone that exci@@ ted the imag@@ in@@ ation of people .
"And now , we have a situ@@ ation in which the bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es in this mall are doing four times the tur@@ no@@ ver that they had proje@@ cted ."
"So , huge things in con@@ stru@@ ction , real est@@ ate , mor@@ t@@ g@@ age marke@@ ts . F@@ in@@ an@@ cial ser@@ vi@@ ces : we had 8@@ 9 ban@@ ks . T@@ o@@ o many not doing their real business ."
We con@@ so@@ li@@ d@@ ated them from 8@@ 9 to 25 ban@@ ks by re@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing that they incre@@ ase their ca@@ pi@@ tal — share ca@@ pi@@ tal .
And it went from about 25 million dollars to 1@@ 50 million dollars .
"The ban@@ ks — these ban@@ ks are now con@@ so@@ li@@ d@@ ated , and that str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening of the ban@@ king system has at@@ trac@@ ted a lot of inv@@ est@@ ment from outside ."
Bar@@ c@@ la@@ ys B@@ ank of the U.@@ K@@ . is br@@ ing@@ ing in 500 million .
St@@ and@@ ard Ch@@ ar@@ ter@@ ed has brought in 1@@ 40 million .
"And I can go on . D@@ ol@@ lars , on and on , into the system ."
We are doing the same with the in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce se@@ ctor .
"So in fin@@ an@@ cial ser@@ vi@@ ces , a great deal of opportunity ."
"In tou@@ ri@@ sm , in many Afri@@ can countries , a great opportunity ."
"And that &apos;s what many people know E@@ ast Africa for : the wil@@ d@@ life , the ele@@ ph@@ an@@ ts , and so on ."
But man@@ ag@@ ing the tou@@ ri@@ sm market in a way that can really b@@ en@@ ef@@ it the people is very important .
So what am I trying to say ? I &apos;m trying to tell you that there &apos;s a new wa@@ ve on the contin@@ ent .
"A new wa@@ ve of open@@ ness and de@@ moc@@ r@@ ati@@ z@@ ation in which , since 2@@ 000 , more than two@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ ds of Afri@@ can countries have had mul@@ ti@@ -@@ par@@ ty de@@ moc@@ r@@ atic ele@@ ctions ."
"N@@ ot all of them have been perfe@@ ct , or will be , but the tr@@ end is very clear ."
"I &apos;m trying to tell you that since the past three years , the a@@ ver@@ age r@@ ate of grow@@ th on the contin@@ ent has mo@@ ved from about 2@@ .@@ 5 percent to about five percent per an@@ n@@ um ."
This is better than the perform@@ ance of many O@@ E@@ C@@ D countries .
So it &apos;s clear that things are chang@@ ing .
"C@@ on@@ fli@@ cts are down on the contin@@ ent ; from about 12 con@@ fli@@ cts a dec@@ ade ago , we are down to three or four con@@ fli@@ cts — one of the most terri@@ ble , of course , of which is D@@ ar@@ fu@@ r ."
"And , you know , you have the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od effe@@ ct where if something is going on in one part of the contin@@ ent , it looks like the entire contin@@ ent is af@@ fe@@ cted ."
"But you should know that this contin@@ ent is not — is a contin@@ ent of many countries , not one country ."
"And if we are down to three or four con@@ fli@@ cts , it means that there are pl@@ en@@ ty of opportuni@@ ties to inv@@ est in st@@ able , grow@@ ing , exci@@ ting econom@@ ies where there &apos;s pl@@ en@@ ty of opportunity ."
And I want to just make one point about this inv@@ est@@ ment .
The best way to help Afri@@ cans today is to help them to stand on their own fe@@ et .
And the best way to do that is by hel@@ ping create j@@ ob@@ s .
There &apos;s no issue with fi@@ gh@@ ting mal@@ ar@@ ia and pu@@ tting money in that and sa@@ ving children &apos;s lives . That &apos;s not what I &apos;m saying . That is f@@ ine .
"But imagine the impac@@ t on a family : if the parents can be em@@ plo@@ yed and make sure that their children go to school , that they can bu@@ y the dru@@ gs to fi@@ ght the dise@@ ase themselves ."
"If we can inv@@ est in places where you your@@ selves make money wh@@ il@@ st cre@@ ating j@@ ob@@ s and hel@@ ping people stand on their own fe@@ et , isn &apos;t that a wonderful opportunity ? I@@ sn &apos;t that the way to go ?"
And I want to say that some of the best people to inv@@ est in on the contin@@ ent are the women .
( Applause ) I have a C@@ D here . I &apos;m sor@@ ry that I didn &apos;t say anything on time .
"O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , I would have li@@ ked you to have seen this ."
"It says , &quot; &quot; Africa : O@@ p@@ en for B@@ us@@ iness . &quot; &quot; And this is a video that has actually won an aw@@ ard as the best do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ary of the year ."
"U@@ n@@ der@@ stand that the woman who made it is going to be in T@@ an@@ z@@ ania , where they &apos;re having the s@@ es@@ sion in Ju@@ ne ."
"But it shows you Afri@@ cans , and parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly Afri@@ can women , who against all od@@ ds have develo@@ ped bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es , some of them wor@@ l@@ d-@@ clas@@ s ."
"One of the women in this video , A@@ d@@ eni@@ ke O@@ g@@ un@@ l@@ es@@ i , making children &apos;s clo@@ the@@ s — which she started as a h@@ ob@@ by and gre@@ w into a business ."
"M@@ i@@ x@@ ing Afri@@ can materi@@ als , such as we have , with materi@@ als from el@@ se@@ where ."
"So , she &apos;ll make a little pa@@ ir of d@@ un@@ g@@ are@@ es with cor@@ du@@ ro@@ ys , with Afri@@ can materi@@ al mi@@ x@@ ed in . V@@ ery cre@@ ative desig@@ ns , has re@@ ach@@ ed a st@@ age where she even had an order from W@@ al@@ -@@ Mar@@ t ."
"( Laughter ) F@@ or 1@@ 0,000 pie@@ ces ."
So that shows you that we have people who are cap@@ able of doing .
And the women are di@@ li@@ g@@ ent . They are fo@@ c@@ used ; they work hard .
"I could go on gi@@ ving exam@@ ples : Be@@ at@@ ri@@ ce G@@ ak@@ u@@ ba of R@@ wan@@ da , who open@@ ed up a f@@ low@@ er business and is now ex@@ por@@ ting to the D@@ ut@@ ch au@@ ction in Am@@ ster@@ d@@ am each morning and is em@@ plo@@ ying 2@@ 00 other women and men to work with her ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , many of these are star@@ ved for ca@@ pi@@ tal to ex@@ p@@ and , because no@@ body belie@@ ves outside of our countries that we can do what is ne@@ cess@@ ary . N@@ ob@@ ody thin@@ ks in terms of a market ."
N@@ ob@@ ody thin@@ ks there &apos;s opportunity .
"But I &apos;m standing here saying that those who mi@@ ss the boat now , will mi@@ ss it fore@@ ver ."
"So if you want to be in Africa , think about inv@@ est@@ ing ."
"Th@@ in@@ k about the Be@@ at@@ ri@@ ces , think about the A@@ d@@ eni@@ k@@ es of this world , who are doing incredible things , that are br@@ ing@@ ing them into the global econom@@ y , wh@@ il@@ st at the same time making sure that their fel@@ low men and women are em@@ plo@@ yed , and that the children in those hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds get edu@@ c@@ ated because their parents are ear@@ ning a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate in@@ come ."
So I in@@ vi@@ te you to expl@@ ore the opportuni@@ ties .
"When you go to T@@ an@@ z@@ ania , list@@ en car@@ e@@ fully , because I &apos;m sure you will hear of the v@@ ari@@ ous open@@ ings that there will be for you to get inv@@ olved in something that will do good for the contin@@ ent , for the people and for your@@ selves ."
Thank you very much .

"A@@ c@@ ross Europ@@ e and C@@ ent@@ ral A@@ si@@ a , appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately one million children live in large resi@@ den@@ tial institu@@ tions , usu@@ ally known as or@@ ph@@ an@@ ages ."
Mo@@ st people imagine or@@ ph@@ an@@ ages as a b@@ eni@@ g@@ n environment that care for children .
"O@@ thers know more about the living con@@ di@@ tions there , but still think they &apos;re a ne@@ cess@@ ary evi@@ l ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , where else would we put all of those children who don &apos;t have any parents ?"
"But 60 years of research has de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated that se@@ par@@ ating children from their fam@@ il@@ ies and plac@@ ing them in large institu@@ tions seri@@ ously har@@ ms their health and develo@@ pment , and this is parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly true for young b@@ ab@@ ies ."
"As we know , b@@ ab@@ ies are born without their full mus@@ cle develo@@ pment , and that inclu@@ des the brain ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing the first three years of life , the brain grow@@ s to its full size , with most of that grow@@ th taking place in the first six months . The brain develo@@ ps in respon@@ se to experience and to sti@@ mul@@ ation ."
"E@@ very time a young b@@ aby lear@@ ns something new — to fo@@ cus its eyes , to mi@@ mi@@ c a movement or a fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sion , to pi@@ ck something up , to form a word or to si@@ t up — new sy@@ na@@ p@@ tic conne@@ ctions are being built in the brain ."
New parents are ast@@ oni@@ shed by the ra@@ pi@@ di@@ ty of this lear@@ ning .
They are quite ri@@ gh@@ tly amaz@@ ed and deli@@ gh@@ ted by their children &apos;s cle@@ ver@@ ness .
"They communi@@ cate their de@@ light to their children , who re@@ spo@@ nd with s@@ miles , and a de@@ si@@ re to ach@@ ie@@ ve more and to learn more ."
"This form@@ ing of the powerful att@@ ach@@ ment between child and par@@ ent provi@@ des the building blo@@ cks for physi@@ cal , social , language , cogni@@ tive and psy@@ ch@@ om@@ ot@@ or develo@@ pment ."
"It is the model for all future relation@@ ships with friends , with part@@ n@@ ers and with their own children ."
"It happens so natur@@ ally in most fam@@ il@@ ies that we don &apos;t even noti@@ ce it . Mo@@ st of us are u@@ naw@@ are of its import@@ ance to human develo@@ pment and , by ex@@ ten@@ sion , to the develo@@ pment of a health@@ y society ."
And it &apos;s only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the import@@ ance of fam@@ il@@ ies to children .
"In Au@@ g@@ ust , 199@@ 3 , I had my first opportunity to wit@@ ness on a mas@@ sive scale the impac@@ t on children of institu@@ tion@@ aliz@@ ation and the ab@@ sen@@ ce of par@@ ent@@ ing ."
Th@@ ose of us who remember the ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er re@@ por@@ ts that came out of R@@ om@@ ania after the 19@@ 8@@ 9 re@@ v@@ olution will re@@ call the hor@@ ro@@ r@@ s of the con@@ di@@ tions in some of those institu@@ tions .
I was asked to help the dire@@ ctor of a large institu@@ tion to help pre@@ v@@ ent the se@@ par@@ ation of children from their fam@@ il@@ ies .
"H@@ ous@@ ing 5@@ 50 b@@ ab@@ ies , this was C@@ e@@ a@@ us@@ es@@ cu &apos;s show or@@ ph@@ an@@ age , and so I &apos;d been told the con@@ di@@ tions were much better ."
"H@@ a@@ ving worked with lots of young children , I expe@@ cted the institu@@ tion to be a ri@@ ot of no@@ ise , but it was as sil@@ ent as a con@@ v@@ ent ."
"It was hard to believe there were any children there at all , yet the dire@@ ctor show@@ ed me into room after room , each con@@ ta@@ ining row upo@@ n row of c@@ ots , in each of which l@@ ay a child star@@ ing into space ."
"In a room of 40 ne@@ w@@ bor@@ ns , not one of them was c@@ ry@@ ing ."
"@@ Y@@ et I could see so@@ i@@ led na@@ p@@ pie@@ s , and I could see that some of the children were di@@ stre@@ s@@ sed , but the only no@@ ise was a low , contin@@ u@@ ous mo@@ an ."
"The head n@@ ur@@ se told me pro@@ ud@@ ly , &quot; You see , our children are very wel@@ l-@@ beha@@ ved . &quot;"
"O@@ ver the next few days , I began to realize that this qu@@ ie@@ t@@ ness was not ex@@ cep@@ ti@@ onal ."
"The ne@@ w@@ ly ad@@ mi@@ t@@ ted b@@ ab@@ ies would c@@ ry for the first few hours , but their de@@ man@@ ds were not met , and so ev@@ en@@ tually they learned not to bo@@ ther . Wi@@ th@@ in a few days , they were list@@ less , le@@ th@@ ar@@ gi@@ c , and star@@ ing into space like all the others ."
"O@@ ver the years , many people and news re@@ por@@ ts have bl@@ am@@ ed the per@@ son@@ ne@@ l in the institu@@ tions for the har@@ m ca@@ used to the children , but often , one member of st@@ af@@ f is car@@ ing for 10 , 20 , and even 40 children ."
H@@ ence they have no op@@ tion but to im@@ ple@@ ment a regi@@ men@@ ted program .
The children must be wok@@ en at 7 and f@@ ed at 7 : 30 .
"A@@ t 8 , their na@@ p@@ pie@@ s must be changed , so a st@@ af@@ f member may have only 30 minutes to fe@@ ed 10 or 20 children ."
"If a child so@@ il@@ s its na@@ pp@@ y at 8 : 30 , he will have to wa@@ it se@@ ver@@ al hours before it can be changed again ."
"The child &apos;s da@@ i@@ ly cont@@ act with another human being is redu@@ ced to a few h@@ ur@@ ried minutes of fe@@ e@@ ding and chang@@ ing , and o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se their only sti@@ mul@@ ation is the ce@@ il@@ ing , the wal@@ ls or the bar@@ s of their c@@ ots ."
"S@@ in@@ ce my first visi@@ t to C@@ e@@ a@@ us@@ es@@ cu &apos;s institu@@ tion , I &apos;ve seen hundre@@ ds of such places across 18 countries , from the C@@ ze@@ ch Re@@ public to S@@ ud@@ an ."
"A@@ c@@ ross all of these di@@ verse l@@ ands and cul@@ tu@@ res , the institu@@ tions , and the child &apos;s jour@@ ney through them , is de@@ pres@@ sing@@ ly si@@ mi@@ lar ."
"L@@ ack of sti@@ mul@@ ation often le@@ ads to self-@@ sti@@ mu@@ lat@@ ing behavi@@ ors like hand@@ -@@ f@@ la@@ pping , ro@@ c@@ king back and for@@ th , or ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sion , and in some institu@@ tions , psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c dru@@ gs are used to control the behavi@@ or of these children , wh@@ il@@ st in others , children are t@@ ied up to pre@@ v@@ ent them from har@@ ming themselves or others ."
These children are quickly la@@ be@@ led as having dis@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies and trans@@ fer@@ red to another institu@@ tion for children with dis@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies .
Mo@@ st of these children will never leave the institu@@ tion again .
"For those without dis@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies , at age three , they &apos;re trans@@ fer@@ red to another institu@@ tion , and at age seven , to yet another . Se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated ac@@ cor@@ ding to age and gen@@ der , they are ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ari@@ ly se@@ par@@ ated from their si@@ b@@ lin@@ gs , often without even a ch@@ ance to say go@@ od@@ by@@ e ."
There &apos;s r@@ are@@ ly enough to e@@ at . They are often hun@@ g@@ ry .
"The ol@@ der children bu@@ lly the little ones . They learn to survi@@ ve . They learn to def@@ end themselves , or they go under ."
"When they leave the institu@@ tion , they find it really difficult to cop@@ e and to inte@@ gr@@ ate into society ."
"In M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a , young women ra@@ is@@ ed in institu@@ tions are 10 times more li@@ ke@@ ly to be traf@@ fi@@ cked than their pe@@ ers , and a R@@ us@@ si@@ an study found that two years after lea@@ ving institu@@ tions , young ad@@ ul@@ ts , 20 percent of them had a cri@@ min@@ al recor@@ d , 14 percent were inv@@ olved in pro@@ stitu@@ tion , and 10 percent had taken their own lives ."
But why are there so many or@@ ph@@ ans in Europ@@ e when there ha@@ sn &apos;t been a great deal of war or disa@@ ster in re@@ cent years ?
"In fact , more than 9@@ 5 percent of these children have living parents , and socie@@ ties ten@@ d to bl@@ ame these parents for ab@@ and@@ on@@ ing these children , but research shows that most parents want their children , and that the pri@@ mar@@ y dri@@ ver@@ s behind institu@@ tion@@ aliz@@ ation are po@@ ver@@ ty , dis@@ ability and e@@ th@@ ni@@ city ."
"M@@ any countries have not develo@@ ped inclu@@ sive scho@@ ols , and so even children with a very mi@@ ld dis@@ ability are s@@ ent away to a resi@@ den@@ tial spe@@ cial school , at age six or seven ."
The institu@@ tion may be hundre@@ ds of miles away from the family home .
"If the family &apos;s po@@ or , they find it difficult to visi@@ t , and gra@@ du@@ ally the relation@@ ship bre@@ ak@@ s down ."
"Be@@ hind each of the million children in institu@@ tions , there is usu@@ ally a story of parents who are des@@ per@@ ate and feel they &apos;ve run out of op@@ tions , like N@@ at@@ ali@@ a in M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a , who only had enough money to fe@@ ed her b@@ aby , and so had to sen@@ d her ol@@ der son to the institu@@ tion ; or D@@ es@@ i , in Bu@@ l@@ gar@@ ia , who looked after her four children at home until her h@@ us@@ b@@ and d@@ ied , but then she had to go out to work full time , and with no sup@@ port , felt she had no op@@ tion but to place a child with dis@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies in an institu@@ tion ; or the coun@@ t@@ less young girls too terri@@ f@@ ied to tell their par@@ ent@@ s@@ "
"@@ they &apos;re pre@@ gn@@ ant , who leave their b@@ ab@@ ies in a ho@@ spit@@ al ; or the new parents , the young couple who have just found out that their fir@@ st@@ born child has a dis@@ ability , and instead of being provi@@ ded with posi@@ tive mess@@ ages about their child &apos;s poten@@ tial , are told by the do@@ ct@@ ors , &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ get her , leave her in the institu@@ tion , go home and make a health@@ y one . &quot; &quot; This state of af@@ fa@@ ir@@ s is ne@@ i@@ ther ne@@ cess@@ ary no@@ r is it in@@ evi@@ table ."
"E@@ very child has the right to a family , des@@ er@@ ves and needs a family , and children are amaz@@ ing@@ ly re@@ sil@@ ien@@ t ."
"We find that if we get them out of institu@@ tions and into lo@@ ving fam@@ il@@ ies early on , they re@@ co@@ ver their develo@@ p@@ ment@@ al de@@ la@@ ys , and go on to le@@ ad nor@@ mal , happy lives ."
It &apos;s also much che@@ ap@@ er to provi@@ de sup@@ port to fam@@ il@@ ies than it is to provi@@ de institu@@ tions .
"One study su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that a family sup@@ port ser@@ vice co@@ sts 10 percent of an institu@@ ti@@ onal plac@@ ement , wh@@ il@@ st good qu@@ ality f@@ ost@@ er care co@@ sts usu@@ ally about 30 percent ."
"If we spend less on these children but on the right ser@@ vi@@ ces , we can take the sa@@ v@@ ings and re@@ inv@@ est them in high qu@@ ality resi@@ den@@ tial care for those few children with extre@@ me@@ ly comple@@ x needs ."
"A@@ c@@ ross Europ@@ e , a movement is grow@@ ing to shi@@ ft the fo@@ cus and trans@@ f@@ er the re@@ sources from large institu@@ tions that provi@@ de po@@ or qu@@ ality care to communi@@ ty@@ -@@ based ser@@ vi@@ ces that prote@@ ct children from har@@ m and al@@ low them to develo@@ p to their full poten@@ tial . When I first started to work in R@@ om@@ ania ne@@ ar@@ ly 20 years ago , there were 200@@ ,000 children living in institu@@ tions , and more en@@ ter@@ ing every day ."
"Now , there are less than 1@@ 0,000 , and family sup@@ port ser@@ vi@@ ces are provi@@ ded across the country ."
"In M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a , des@@ pi@@ te extre@@ me po@@ ver@@ ty and the terri@@ ble effe@@ cts of the global fin@@ an@@ cial cri@@ sis , the num@@ bers of children in institu@@ tions has redu@@ ced by more than 50 percent in the last five years , and the re@@ sources are being re@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted to family sup@@ port ser@@ vi@@ ces and inclu@@ sive scho@@ ols ."
M@@ any countries have develo@@ ped national action pl@@ ans for change .
"The Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an C@@ om@@ mis@@ sion and other major d@@ on@@ ors are fin@@ ding ways to di@@ ver@@ t money from institu@@ tions towar@@ ds family sup@@ port , em@@ power@@ ing communi@@ ties to look after their own children ."
But there is still much to be done to end the system@@ atic institu@@ tion@@ aliz@@ ation of children .
A@@ war@@ en@@ ess@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ing is requi@@ red at every level of society .
"P@@ e@@ ople need to know the har@@ m that institu@@ tions cause to children , and the better alter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves that exi@@ st ."
"If we know people who are plan@@ ning to sup@@ port or@@ ph@@ an@@ ages , we should con@@ v@@ in@@ ce them to sup@@ port family ser@@ vi@@ ces instead ."
"T@@ og@@ e@@ ther , this is the one form of child ab@@ use that we could er@@ ad@@ i@@ cate in our li@@ fe@@ time ."

"And along the way , he became the face for the U@@ S government &apos;s re@@ cent pat@@ ter@@ n of pro@@ secu@@ ting wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers and sp@@ ying on jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sts ."
"You see , under the F@@ ir@@ st Am@@ en@@ d@@ ment , the pre@@ ss has the right to publi@@ sh se@@ cre@@ t information in the public inter@@ est ."
"So from 200@@ 7 to 20@@ 15 , R@@ is@@ en li@@ ved under the spe@@ c@@ ter of going to fe@@ der@@ al pri@@ son ."
"That is , until just days before the tri@@ al , when a cu@@ ri@@ ous thing happened ."
"S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly , after years of c@@ la@@ im@@ ing it was vi@@ tal to their case , the government dro@@ pped their de@@ man@@ ds to R@@ is@@ en al@@ together ."
"And instead of trying and fa@@ il@@ ing to have R@@ is@@ en te@@ sti@@ fy , they could have his di@@ gi@@ tal tra@@ il te@@ sti@@ fy against him instead ."
"So completely in se@@ cre@@ t and without his con@@ s@@ ent , pro@@ secu@@ t@@ ors got R@@ is@@ en &apos;s phone recor@@ ds ."
"They got his e@@ ma@@ il recor@@ ds , his fin@@ an@@ cial and ban@@ king information , his cre@@ d@@ it re@@ por@@ ts , even tra@@ vel recor@@ ds with a li@@ st of fli@@ ghts he had taken ."
"And it was am@@ ong this information that they used to con@@ vi@@ ct J@@ ef@@ fre@@ y S@@ ter@@ ling , R@@ is@@ en &apos;s al@@ leg@@ ed source and C@@ I@@ A wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ er ."
"S@@ ad@@ ly , this is only one case of many ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad of sen@@ ding an e@@ ma@@ il , you go to a news organiz@@ ation &apos;s we@@ b@@ site , like this one here on The W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton Po@@ st ."
"F@@ ro@@ m there , you can up@@ lo@@ ad a do@@ cu@@ ment or sen@@ d information much like you would on any other cont@@ act form ."
It &apos;ll then be en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted and sto@@ red on a ser@@ ver that only the news organiz@@ ation has ac@@ cess to .
"S@@ e@@ cu@@ re@@ D@@ ro@@ p , though , is really only a small part of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le for prote@@ cting pre@@ ss fre@@ e@@ dom in the 2@@ 1@@ st century ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , govern@@ ments all over the world are con@@ stan@@ tly develo@@ ping new sp@@ ying techni@@ qu@@ es that put us all at ri@@ sk ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , these to@@ ols wer@@ en &apos;t just built to help the bra@@ ve men and women who ex@@ pos@@ e cri@@ mes , but are me@@ ant to prote@@ ct all of our ri@@ ghts under the Con@@ stitu@@ tion ."
Thank you .

We are d@@ row@@ ning in news .
Re@@ u@@ ters alone pu@@ ts out three and a half million news stories a year .
That &apos;s just one source .
My question is : How many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run ?
That &apos;s the idea behind The L@@ ong N@@ ew@@ s .
"It &apos;s a project by The L@@ ong Now F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation , which was f@@ oun@@ ded by TE@@ D@@ st@@ ers inclu@@ ding K@@ ev@@ in K@@ el@@ ly and Ste@@ war@@ t B@@ r@@ and ."
"And what we &apos;re looking for is news stories that might still matter 50 or 100 or 1@@ 0,000 years from now ."
"And when you look at the news through that fil@@ ter , a lot fal@@ ls by the wa@@ y@@ side ."
"To take the top stories from the A@@ .@@ P@@ . this last year , is this going to matter in a dec@@ ade ?"
O@@ r this ? O@@ r this ?
"R@@ e@@ ally ? Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years ? O@@ kay , that was kind of cool . ( Laughter )"
"But the top story of this past year was the econom@@ y , and I &apos;m just bet@@ ting that , so@@ on@@ er or later , this particular re@@ ces@@ sion is going to be old news ."
"So , what kind of stories might make a difference for the future ?"
"Well , let &apos;s take science ."
"S@@ om@@ ed@@ ay , little rob@@ ots will go through our blo@@ od@@ stre@@ am@@ s fi@@ x@@ ing things ."
That some@@ day is already here if you &apos;re a m@@ ou@@ se .
S@@ ome re@@ cent stories : n@@ an@@ obe@@ es za@@ p tu@@ mor@@ s with real be@@ e ven@@ om ; they &apos;re sen@@ ding gen@@ es into the brain ; a robot they built that can c@@ raw@@ l through the human body .
What about re@@ sources ? How are we going to fe@@ ed n@@ ine billion people ?
We &apos;re having t@@ rou@@ ble fe@@ e@@ ding six billion today .
"As we heard y@@ est@@ er@@ day , there &apos;s over a billion people hun@@ g@@ ry ."
Bri@@ tain will star@@ ve without gen@@ e@@ ti@@ cally mo@@ dif@@ ied cro@@ ps .
"B@@ i@@ ll G@@ ates , for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , has be@@ t a billion on &#91; agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral &#93; research ."
What about global poli@@ ti@@ cs ?
"The world &apos;s going to be very different when and if China se@@ ts the ag@@ en@@ da , and they may ."
"They &apos;ve over@@ taken the U.@@ S. as the world &apos;s bi@@ ggest car market , they &apos;ve over@@ taken G@@ er@@ many as the largest ex@@ por@@ ter , and they &apos;ve started doing DNA te@@ sts on kids to cho@@ ose their car@@ e@@ ers ."
We &apos;re fin@@ ding all kinds of ways to p@@ us@@ h back the li@@ mi@@ ts of what we know .
"S@@ ome re@@ cent disco@@ ver@@ ies : There &apos;s an ant col@@ ony from Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ ina that has now sp@@ read to every contin@@ ent but An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca ; there &apos;s a self-@@ dire@@ cted robot scienti@@ st that &apos;s made a disco@@ very — so@@ on , science may no longer need us , and life may no longer need us either ; a micro@@ be wa@@ k@@ es up after 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ."
"It seem@@ s that with or without us , life will go on ."
But my pi@@ ck for the top L@@ ong N@@ ew@@ s story of this past year was this one : water found on the mo@@ on .
M@@ ak@@ es it a lot e@@ as@@ ier to put a col@@ ony up there .
"And if N@@ A@@ SA doesn &apos;t do it , China might , or somebody in this room might write a big che@@ ck ."
"My point is this : In the long run , some news stories are more important than others ."
( Applause )
"S@@ i@@ x thous@@ and miles of ro@@ ad , 6@@ 00 miles of sub@@ way tr@@ ack , 4@@ 00 miles of bi@@ ke lan@@ es and a half a mi@@ le of tra@@ m tr@@ ack , if you &apos;ve ever been to Ro@@ o@@ se@@ v@@ el@@ t Is@@ land ."
These are the num@@ bers that make up the in@@ fra@@ structure of New York C@@ ity .
These are the st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs of our in@@ fra@@ structure .
They &apos;re the kind of num@@ bers you can find rele@@ as@@ ed in re@@ por@@ ts by city ag@@ en@@ cies .
The M@@ T@@ A will bo@@ ast how many miles of sub@@ way tr@@ ack there are .
Mo@@ st city ag@@ en@@ cies give us st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs .
"This is from a re@@ port this year from the T@@ ax@@ i and L@@ im@@ ous@@ ine C@@ om@@ mis@@ sion , where we learn that there &apos;s about 1@@ 3@@ ,@@ 500 ta@@ x@@ is here in New York C@@ ity ."
"P@@ re@@ t@@ ty interesting , right ?"
But did you ever think about where these num@@ bers came from ?
"Because for these num@@ bers to exi@@ st , someone at the city ag@@ en@@ cy had to stop and say , h@@ m@@ m , here &apos;s a number that somebody might want want to know ."
Here &apos;s a number that our ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens want to know .
"So they go back to their ra@@ w data , they coun@@ t , they ad@@ d , they cal@@ cul@@ ate , and then they put out re@@ por@@ ts , and those re@@ por@@ ts will have num@@ bers like this ."
"The problem is , how do they know all of our questions ?"
We have lots of questions .
The ag@@ en@@ cies can never keep up .
"So the par@@ ad@@ ig@@ m isn &apos;t exactly working , and I think our poli@@ cy@@ mak@@ ers realize that , because in 20@@ 12 , Ma@@ y@@ or B@@ lo@@ om@@ ber@@ g sig@@ ned into la@@ w what he called the most am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous and com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sive open data le@@ gi@@ sl@@ ation in the country ."
"In a lot of ways , he &apos;s right ."
"In the last two years , the city has rele@@ as@@ ed 1@@ ,000 d@@ at@@ as@@ ets on our open data port@@ al , and it &apos;s pretty aw@@ es@@ ome ."
"So you go and look at data like this , and instead of just coun@@ ting the number of c@@ ab@@ s , we can start to ask different questions ."
So I had a question .
When &apos;s rus@@ h hour in New York C@@ ity ?
It can be pretty bo@@ ther@@ some . When is rus@@ h hour exactly ?
"And I thought to myself , these c@@ ab@@ s ar@@ en &apos;t just num@@ bers , these are G@@ P@@ S recor@@ ders dri@@ ving around in our city stre@@ ets recor@@ ding each and every ri@@ de they take ."
"There &apos;s data there , and I looked at that data , and I made a p@@ lot of the a@@ ver@@ age speed of ta@@ x@@ is in New York C@@ ity throu@@ gh@@ out the day ."
"You can see that from about mi@@ dni@@ ght to around 5 : 18 in the morning , speed incre@@ ases , and at that point , things turn around , and they get s@@ low@@ er and s@@ low@@ er and s@@ low@@ er until about 8 : 3@@ 5 in the morning , when they end up at around 11 and a half miles per hour ."
"The a@@ ver@@ age ta@@ x@@ i is going 11 and a half miles per hour on our city stre@@ ets , and it turns out it sta@@ ys that way for the entire day ."
"( Laughter ) So I said to myself , I gu@@ ess there &apos;s no rus@@ h hour in New York C@@ ity ."
There &apos;s just a rus@@ h day .
M@@ ak@@ es sense . And this is important for a couple of reas@@ ons .
"If you &apos;re a transpor@@ tation plan@@ ner , this might be pretty interesting to know ."
"But if you want to get some@@ where quickly , you now know to set your al@@ ar@@ m for 4 : 4@@ 5 in the morning and you &apos;re all set ."
"N@@ e@@ w York , right ?"
But there &apos;s a story behind this data .
"This data wasn &apos;t just available , it turns out ."
"It actually came from something called a F@@ re@@ e@@ dom of In@@ form@@ ation L@@ a@@ w Re@@ qu@@ est , or a F@@ O@@ I@@ L Re@@ qu@@ est ."
This is a form you can find on the T@@ ax@@ i and L@@ im@@ ous@@ ine C@@ om@@ mis@@ sion we@@ b@@ site .
"Now , Ch@@ ris is the kind of guy who wan@@ ts to make the data public , and so it en@@ ded up on@@ line for all to use , and that &apos;s where this gra@@ ph came from ."
And the fact that it ex@@ ist@@ s is amazing . These G@@ P@@ S recor@@ ders — really cool .
And we can do better than that as a city .
"Now , not every d@@ at@@ as@@ et is behind a F@@ O@@ I@@ L Re@@ qu@@ est ."
Here is a ma@@ p I made with the most d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous inter@@ se@@ ctions in New York C@@ ity based on cy@@ cli@@ st ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents .
This is exactly what we &apos;re looking for .
But there &apos;s a story behind this data as well .
This data didn &apos;t just ap@@ pe@@ ar .
How many of you guys know this lo@@ go ?
"@@ Yeah , I see some sha@@ k@@ es ."
Ha@@ ve you ever tr@@ ied to cop@@ y and pa@@ ste data out of a P@@ D@@ F and make sense of it ?
I see more sha@@ k@@ es .
"So what happened is , the data that you just saw was actually on a P@@ D@@ F ."
"J@@ o@@ h@@ n K@@ ra@@ us@@ s was like , I &apos;m not going to cop@@ y and pa@@ ste this data . I &apos;m going to write a program ."
"And the fact that the data &apos;s here , the fact that we have ac@@ cess to it — E@@ very ac@@ ci@@ dent , by the way , is a row in this table ."
You can imagine how many P@@ D@@ F@@ s that is .
"The fact that we have ac@@ cess to that is great , but let &apos;s not rele@@ ase it in P@@ D@@ F form , because then we &apos;re having our ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens write P@@ D@@ F sc@@ ra@@ per@@ s ."
"Now , the good news is that the de B@@ la@@ si@@ o ad@@ min@@ ist@@ r@@ ation actually re@@ cent@@ ly rele@@ as@@ ed this data a few months ago , and so now we can actually have ac@@ cess to it , but there &apos;s a lot of data still ent@@ om@@ bed in P@@ D@@ F ."
"For example , our cri@@ me data is still only available in P@@ D@@ F ."
O@@ ur city bud@@ get is only re@@ ad@@ able right now in P@@ D@@ F form .
And it &apos;s not just us that can &apos;t an@@ al@@ y@@ ze it — our own le@@ gi@@ s@@ lat@@ ors who v@@ ot@@ e for the bud@@ get also only get it in P@@ D@@ F .
So our le@@ gi@@ s@@ lat@@ ors cannot an@@ al@@ y@@ ze the bud@@ get that they are v@@ ot@@ ing for .
And I think as a city we can do a little better than that as well .
"Now , there &apos;s a lot of data that &apos;s not hi@@ d@@ den in P@@ D@@ F@@ s ."
"This is an example of a ma@@ p I made , and this is the di@@ r@@ t@@ ie@@ st wat@@ er@@ ways in New York C@@ ity ."
"Now , how do I meas@@ ure di@@ r@@ ty ?"
"Well , it &apos;s kind of a little we@@ ird , but I looked at the level of fe@@ cal co@@ li@@ form , which is a meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment of fe@@ cal matter in each of our wat@@ er@@ ways ."
"The lar@@ ger the cir@@ cle , the di@@ r@@ t@@ ier the water , so the large cir@@ cles are di@@ r@@ ty water , the small cir@@ cles are cle@@ an@@ er ."
What you see is in@@ land wat@@ er@@ ways .
"And in@@ land wat@@ er@@ ways are , in gener@@ al , di@@ r@@ t@@ ier ."
"That makes sense , right ?"
And the bi@@ g@@ ger cir@@ cles are di@@ r@@ ty . And I learned a few things from this .
"In Con@@ ey Is@@ land C@@ re@@ ek , which is not the Con@@ ey Is@@ land you s@@ wi@@ m in , lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly ."
It &apos;s on the other side .
It &apos;s not going to be the front p@@ age on n@@ y@@ c@@ .@@ go@@ v@@ .
"But once again , it wasn &apos;t su@@ per e@@ asy , because this data was not on the open data port@@ al ."
"If you were to go to the open data port@@ al , you &apos;d see just a s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ t of it , a year or a few months ."
"Wh@@ atever you want , you can dow@@ n@@ lo@@ ad the data that way ."
"So one is stre@@ et name , inter@@ se@@ ction stre@@ et , stre@@ et , bo@@ rou@@ gh , ad@@ dre@@ ss , building , building ad@@ dre@@ ss ."
"So once again , you &apos;re sp@@ ending time , even when we have this port@@ al , you &apos;re sp@@ ending time nor@@ m@@ aliz@@ ing our ad@@ dre@@ ss fie@@ l@@ ds ."
And that &apos;s not the best use of our ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens &apos; time .
We can do better than that as a city .
"We can stan@@ dar@@ di@@ ze our ad@@ dre@@ s@@ ses , and if we do , we can get more ma@@ ps like this ."
"This is a ma@@ p of fi@@ re hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts in New York C@@ ity , but not just any fi@@ re hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts ."
These are the top 2@@ 50 gro@@ s@@ sing fi@@ re hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts in terms of par@@ king ti@@ c@@ ke@@ ts .
"But then , a few weeks later , something incredible happened ."
"They re@@ pain@@ ted the spo@@ t , and for a second I thought I saw the future of open data , because think about what happened here ."
All we need are a few chang@@ es .
And let &apos;s ad@@ op@@ t and share some open data stan@@ dar@@ ds .
It &apos;s not science fi@@ ction . We &apos;re actually quite close .
"And by the way , who are we em@@ power@@ ing with this ?"
Because it &apos;s not just Joh@@ n K@@ ra@@ us@@ s and it &apos;s not just Ch@@ ris Wh@@ ong .
There are thousands of people at@@ ten@@ ding these me@@ e@@ tu@@ ps .
"You put in your ad@@ dre@@ ss , you get local com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts ."
And it &apos;s not just the te@@ ch community that are after these things .
"It &apos;s poli@@ cy adv@@ oc@@ ates , it &apos;s everyone , it &apos;s ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens from a di@@ verse set of back@@ gro@@ un@@ ds ."
"And with some small , incre@@ ment@@ al chang@@ es , we can un@@ lo@@ ck the pas@@ sion and the ability of our ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens to har@@ ness open data and make our city even better , whether it &apos;s one d@@ at@@ as@@ et , or one par@@ king spo@@ t at a time ."
Thank you .

What does a working mother look like ?
"If you ask the Inter@@ net , this is what you &apos;ll be told ."
N@@ ever mind that this is what you &apos;ll actually produ@@ ce if you at@@ tem@@ pt to work at a computer with a b@@ aby on your la@@ p .
"( Laughter ) But no , this isn &apos;t a working mother ."
You &apos;ll noti@@ ce a the@@ me in these ph@@ ot@@ os . We &apos;ll look at a lot of them .
"That the@@ me is amazing natural li@@ gh@@ ting , which , as we all know , is the hal@@ l@@ mar@@ k of every American wor@@ k@@ place ."
There are thousands of images like these .
"J@@ ust put the ter@@ m &quot; &quot; working mother &quot; &quot; into any Go@@ og@@ le image sear@@ ch eng@@ ine , sto@@ ck ph@@ oto site ."
"They &apos;re all over the Inter@@ net , they &apos;re top@@ ping blo@@ g po@@ sts and news pie@@ ces , and I &apos;ve become kind of ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with them and the lie that they tell us and the comfor@@ t that they give us , that when it comes to new working mo@@ ther@@ ho@@ od in America , everything &apos;s f@@ ine ."
But it &apos;s not f@@ ine .
"As a country , we are sen@@ ding mi@@ llions of women back to work every year , incredi@@ bly and kind of hor@@ ri@@ fi@@ cally so@@ on after they give bir@@ th ."
That &apos;s a mor@@ al problem but today I &apos;m also going to tell you why it &apos;s an economic problem .
"I got so an@@ no@@ yed and ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with the un@@ re@@ ality of these images , which look nothing like my life , that I re@@ cent@@ ly decided to sho@@ ot and st@@ ar in a pa@@ ro@@ dy ser@@ ies of sto@@ ck ph@@ ot@@ os that I hop@@ ed the world would start to use just show@@ ing the really aw@@ k@@ ward re@@ ality of going back to work when your b@@ aby &apos;s food source is att@@ ach@@ ed to your body ."
I &apos;m just going to show you two of them .
( Laughter ) N@@ o@@ thing says &quot; &quot; G@@ i@@ ve that girl a pro@@ moti@@ on &quot; &quot; like le@@ aking bre@@ ast mi@@ l@@ k through your dre@@ ss during a pres@@ ent@@ ation .
"You &apos;ll noti@@ ce that there &apos;s no b@@ aby in this ph@@ oto , because that &apos;s not how this works , not for most working mo@@ thers ."
"D@@ id you know , and this will ru@@ in your day , that every time a to@@ i@@ let is fl@@ us@@ h@@ ed , its cont@@ ents are a@@ er@@ os@@ o@@ liz@@ ed and they &apos;ll st@@ ay air@@ bor@@ ne for hours ?"
"And yet , for many new working mo@@ thers , this is the only place during the day that they can find to make food for their ne@@ w@@ born b@@ ab@@ ies ."
"I put these things , a whole do@@ z@@ en of them , into the world ."
I wanted to make a point .
"I didn &apos;t know what I was also doing was open@@ ing a door , because now , tot@@ al str@@ ang@@ ers from all wal@@ ks of life write to me all the time just to tell me what it &apos;s like for them to go back to work within days or weeks of having a b@@ aby ."
I &apos;m going to share 10 of their stories with you today .
"They are tot@@ ally real , some of them are very ra@@ w , and not one of them looks anything like this ."
Here &apos;s the first .
&quot; &quot; I was an ac@@ tive du@@ ty ser@@ vice member at a fe@@ der@@ al pri@@ son .
I re@@ turned to work after the ma@@ x@@ i@@ mu@@ m allow@@ ed eight weeks for my C@@ -@@ se@@ ction .
"A m@@ ale c@@ ow@@ or@@ k@@ er was an@@ no@@ yed that I had been out on &apos; vac@@ ation , &apos; so he inten@@ tion@@ ally open@@ ed the door on me while I was pu@@ m@@ ping bre@@ ast mi@@ l@@ k and sto@@ od in the do@@ or@@ way with in@@ mat@@ es in the hal@@ l@@ way . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ st of the stories that these women , tot@@ al str@@ ang@@ ers , sen@@ d to me now , are not actually even about bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ e@@ ding ."
"A woman wro@@ te to me to say , &quot; &quot; I gave bir@@ th to tw@@ ins and went back to work after seven un@@ pa@@ id weeks ."
"E@@ moti@@ on@@ ally , I was a w@@ re@@ ck ."
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ cally , I had a se@@ v@@ ere he@@ mor@@ r@@ ha@@ ge during lab@@ or , and major te@@ aring , so I could bar@@ ely get up , si@@ t or walk ."
"My em@@ plo@@ y@@ er told me I wasn &apos;t allow@@ ed to use my available vac@@ ation days because it was bud@@ get se@@ as@@ on . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve come to believe that we can &apos;t look situ@@ ations like these in the ey@@ e because then we &apos;d be hor@@ ri@@ f@@ ied , and if we get hor@@ ri@@ f@@ ied then we have to do something about it ."
"So we cho@@ ose to look at , and believe , this image ."
"I don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on in this picture , because I find it we@@ ird and sli@@ gh@@ tly cre@@ e@@ py ."
"( Laughter ) Li@@ ke , what is she doing ?"
But I know what it tel@@ ls us .
It tel@@ ls us that everything &apos;s f@@ ine .
"This working mother , all working mo@@ thers and all of their b@@ ab@@ ies , are f@@ ine ."
There &apos;s nothing to see here .
"And any@@ way , women have made a cho@@ ice , so n@@ one of it &apos;s even our problem ."
I want to bre@@ ak this cho@@ ice thing down into two par@@ ts .
The first cho@@ ice says that women have cho@@ s@@ en to work .
"So , that &apos;s not true ."
"T@@ od@@ ay in America , women make up 4@@ 7 percent of the wor@@ k@@ force , and in 40 percent of American hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds a woman is the so@@ le or pri@@ mar@@ y bre@@ ad@@ win@@ ner ."
"O@@ ur pa@@ id work is a part , a huge part , of the eng@@ ine of this econom@@ y , and it is essen@@ tial for the en@@ gin@@ es of our fam@@ il@@ ies ."
"O@@ n a national level , our pa@@ id work is not op@@ ti@@ onal ."
"Cho@@ ice number two says that women are cho@@ os@@ ing to have b@@ ab@@ ies , so women alone should be@@ ar the con@@ sequ@@ ences of those cho@@ i@@ ces ."
"You know , that &apos;s one of those things that when you hear it in pas@@ sing , can sound cor@@ re@@ ct ."
I didn &apos;t make you have a b@@ aby .
I cer@@ tain@@ ly wasn &apos;t there when that happened .
"But that stance ig@@ no@@ res a fundam@@ ent@@ al tru@@ th , which is that our pro@@ cre@@ ation on a national scale is not op@@ ti@@ onal ."
These ar@@ en &apos;t cho@@ i@@ ces .
We need women to work . We need working women to have b@@ ab@@ ies .
"So we should make doing those things at the same time at least pal@@ at@@ able , right ?"
"O@@ K , this is po@@ p qui@@ z time : what per@@ cent@@ age of working women in America do you think have no ac@@ cess to pa@@ id mat@@ er@@ ni@@ ty leave ?"
8@@ 8 percent .
8@@ 8 percent of working mo@@ thers will not get one minu@@ te of pa@@ id leave after they have a b@@ aby .
So now you &apos;re thinking about un@@ pa@@ id leave .
It ex@@ ist@@ s in America . It &apos;s called F@@ M@@ L@@ A . It does not work .
"Because of the way it &apos;s stru@@ ctu@@ red , all kinds of ex@@ cep@@ tions , half of new mo@@ thers are in@@ e@@ li@@ gi@@ ble for it ."
Here &apos;s what that looks like .
&quot; &quot; We ad@@ op@@ ted our son .
"When I got the call , the day he was born , I had to take off work ."
"I had not been there long enough to qu@@ ali@@ fy for F@@ M@@ L@@ A , so I wasn &apos;t e@@ li@@ gi@@ ble for un@@ pa@@ id leave ."
"When I took time off to me@@ et my ne@@ w@@ born son , I lost my job . &quot; &quot; These cor@@ por@@ ate sto@@ ck ph@@ ot@@ os hi@@ de another re@@ ality , another la@@ y@@ er ."
"O@@ f those who do have ac@@ cess to just that un@@ pa@@ id leave , most women can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d to take much of it at all ."
"A n@@ ur@@ se told me , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t qu@@ ali@@ fy for shor@@ t-@@ ter@@ m dis@@ ability because my pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy was consi@@ der@@ ed a pre@@ ex@@ ist@@ ing con@@ di@@ tion ."
We used up all of our ta@@ x re@@ turns and half of our sa@@ v@@ ings during my six un@@ pa@@ id weeks .
We just couldn &apos;t man@@ age any longer .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ cally it was hard , but emoti@@ on@@ ally it was wor@@ se ."
"I stru@@ gg@@ led for months being away from my son . &quot; &quot; So this deci@@ sion to go back to work so early , it &apos;s a r@@ ational economic deci@@ sion dri@@ ven by family fin@@ an@@ ces , but it &apos;s often physi@@ cally hor@@ ri@@ fic because pu@@ tting a human into the world is mess@@ y ."
"A wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss told me , &quot; &quot; Wi@@ th my first b@@ aby , I was back at work five weeks post@@ par@@ tu@@ m ."
"Wi@@ th my second , I had to have major sur@@ g@@ ery after gi@@ ving bir@@ th , so I wai@@ ted until six weeks to go back ."
I had third de@@ gre@@ e te@@ ars . &quot; &quot; 2@@ 3 percent of new working mo@@ thers in America will be back on the job within two weeks of gi@@ ving bir@@ th .
"&quot; &quot; I worked as a bar@@ ten@@ der and co@@ ok , a@@ ver@@ age of 7@@ 5 hours a week while pre@@ gn@@ ant ."
"I had to re@@ turn to work before my b@@ aby was a mon@@ th old , working 60 hours a week ."
"One of my c@@ ow@@ or@@ k@@ ers was only able to af@@ for@@ d 10 days off with her b@@ aby . &quot; &quot; O@@ f course , this isn &apos;t just a scen@@ ari@@ o with economic and physi@@ cal im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations ."

"H@@ e@@ ads up that this next story — I &apos;ve never met this woman , but I find it hard to get through ."
"&quot; &quot; I feel tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous gr@@ ie@@ f and ra@@ ge that I lost an essen@@ tial , ir@@ re@@ plac@@ e@@ able and form@@ ative time with my son ."
L@@ ab@@ or and deli@@ very left me feeling absolu@@ tely bro@@ k@@ en .
"For months , all I remember is the scre@@ am@@ ing : co@@ li@@ c , they said ."
"O@@ n the inside , I was d@@ row@@ ning ."
"E@@ very morning , I asked myself how much longer I could do it ."
I was allow@@ ed to bring my b@@ aby to work .
I clo@@ sed my offi@@ ce door while I ro@@ cked and sh@@ us@@ h@@ ed and be@@ gg@@ ed him to stop scre@@ am@@ ing so I wouldn &apos;t get in t@@ rou@@ ble .
I hi@@ d behind that offi@@ ce door every dam@@ n day and c@@ ried while he scre@@ am@@ ed .
I c@@ ried in the ba@@ th@@ room while I wa@@ shed out the pu@@ m@@ p e@@ qui@@ pment .
"E@@ very day , I c@@ ried all the way to work and all the way home again ."
"I pro@@ mis@@ ed my b@@ os@@ s that the work I didn &apos;t get done during the day , I &apos;d make up at night from home ."
"I thought , there &apos;s just something wrong with me that I can &apos;t s@@ w@@ ing this . &quot; &quot; So those are the mo@@ thers ."
What of the b@@ ab@@ ies ?
"As a country , do we care about the mi@@ llions of b@@ ab@@ ies born every year to working mo@@ thers ?"
"I say we don &apos;t , not until they &apos;re of working and ta@@ x@@ -@@ pa@@ ying and mi@@ lit@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ ser@@ ving age ."
"We tell them we &apos;ll see them in 18 years , and getting there is kind of on them ."
"One of the reas@@ ons I know this is that b@@ ab@@ ies wh@@ ose mo@@ thers have 12 or more weeks at home with them are more li@@ ke@@ ly to get their vac@@ cin@@ ations and their well che@@ cks in their first year , so those b@@ ab@@ ies are more prote@@ cted from de@@ ad@@ ly and dis@@ ab@@ ling dise@@ ases ."
But those things are hi@@ d@@ den behind images like this .
America has a mess@@ age for new mo@@ thers who work and for their b@@ ab@@ ies .
"Wh@@ atever time you get together , you should be gr@@ ate@@ ful for it , and you &apos;re an in@@ con@@ ven@@ ience to the econom@@ y and to your em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers ."
That nar@@ r@@ ative of gr@@ ati@@ tu@@ de ru@@ ns through a lot of the stories I hear .
"A woman told me , &quot; &quot; I went back at eight weeks after my C@@ -@@ se@@ ction because my h@@ us@@ b@@ and was out of work ."
"Wi@@ th@@ out me , my d@@ aughter had fai@@ lu@@ re to th@@ ri@@ ve ."
She wouldn &apos;t take a bot@@ tle .
She started lo@@ sing we@@ ight .
"Th@@ an@@ k@@ fully , my man@@ ag@@ er was very under@@ standing ."
"He let my mo@@ m bring my b@@ aby , who was on o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en and a mon@@ it@@ or , four times a shi@@ ft so I could n@@ ur@@ se her . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a little c@@ lub of countries in the world that of@@ f@@ er no national pa@@ id leave to new mo@@ thers ."
C@@ are to gu@@ ess who they are ?
The first eight make up eight million in tot@@ al popul@@ ation .
"They are P@@ a@@ pu@@ a New G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a , S@@ ur@@ in@@ ame and the t@@ iny is@@ land n@@ ations of Mi@@ cro@@ ne@@ si@@ a , Mar@@ sh@@ all Is@@ l@@ ands , N@@ au@@ r@@ u , Ni@@ ue , P@@ al@@ a@@ u and T@@ on@@ ga ."
"N@@ um@@ ber n@@ ine is the United States of America , with 3@@ 20 million people ."
"O@@ h , that &apos;s it ."
That &apos;s the end of the li@@ st .
"E@@ very other econom@@ y on the planet has found a way to make some level of national pa@@ id leave work for the people doing the work of the future of those countries , but we say , &quot; &quot; We couldn &apos;t possi@@ bly do that . &quot; &quot; We say that the market will sol@@ ve this problem , and then we che@@ er when cor@@ por@@ ations of@@ f@@ er even more pa@@ id leave to the women who are already the high@@ est@@ -@@ edu@@ c@@ ated and high@@ est@@ -@@ pa@@ id am@@ ong us ."
Re@@ member that 8@@ 8 percent ?
Th@@ ose mi@@ dd@@ le@@ - and low@@ -@@ in@@ come women are not going to parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in that .
"We know that there are st@@ ag@@ g@@ ering economic , fin@@ an@@ cial , physi@@ cal and emoti@@ onal co@@ sts to this appro@@ ach ."
"We have decided — decided , not an ac@@ ci@@ dent , to pas@@ s these co@@ sts dire@@ ct@@ ly on to working mo@@ thers and their b@@ ab@@ ies ."
"We know the pri@@ ce ta@@ g is high@@ er for low@@ -@@ in@@ come women , ther@@ e@@ fore dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately for women of color ."
We pas@@ s them on any@@ way .
All of this is to America &apos;s sha@@ me .
But it &apos;s also to America &apos;s ri@@ sk .
Because what would happen if all of these individu@@ al so@@ -@@ called cho@@ i@@ ces to have b@@ ab@@ ies started to turn into individu@@ al cho@@ i@@ ces not to have b@@ ab@@ ies .
"One woman told me , &quot; &quot; New mo@@ ther@@ ho@@ od is hard . It sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be tra@@ um@@ atic ."
"When we talk about ex@@ pan@@ ding our family now , we fo@@ cus on how much time I would have to care for myself and a new b@@ aby ."
"If we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first , we might sti@@ ck with one kid . &quot; &quot; The bir@@ th@@ r@@ ate needed in America to keep the popul@@ ation st@@ able is 2@@ .@@ 1 live bir@@ ths per woman ."
"In America today , we are at 1@@ .@@ 8@@ 6 ."
"We need women to have b@@ ab@@ ies , and we are acti@@ vely dis@@ in@@ cen@@ ti@@ vi@@ z@@ ing working women from doing that ."
"What would happen to work force , to in@@ no@@ vation , to G@@ D@@ P , if one by one , the working mo@@ thers of this country were to deci@@ de that they can &apos;t be@@ ar to do this thing more than once ?"
"I &apos;m here today with only one idea wor@@ th sp@@ re@@ ading , and you &apos;ve gu@@ ess@@ ed what it is ."
It is long since time for the most powerful country on Earth to of@@ f@@ er national pa@@ id leave to the people doing the work of the future of this country and to the b@@ ab@@ ies who re@@ present that future .
Ch@@ il@@ d@@ bir@@ th is a public good .
This leave should be st@@ ate@@ -@@ sub@@ si@@ di@@ zed .
"It should have no ex@@ cep@@ tions for small bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es , len@@ g@@ th of em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment or ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s ."
It should be able to be sh@@ ared between part@@ n@@ ers .
"I &apos;ve tal@@ ked today a lot about mo@@ thers , but co@@ -@@ parents matter on so many le@@ v@@ els ."
N@@ ot one more woman should have to go back to work while she is h@@ ob@@ b@@ ling and b@@ le@@ e@@ ding .
N@@ ot one more family should have to dra@@ in their sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ t to bu@@ y a few days of rest and re@@ co@@ very and b@@ on@@ ding .
N@@ ot one more fra@@ gi@@ le in@@ f@@ ant should have to go dire@@ ct@@ ly from the in@@ cu@@ bat@@ or to day care because his parents have used up all of their me@@ ag@@ er time sitting in the N@@ I@@ C@@ U .
"N@@ ot one more working family should be told that the col@@ li@@ sion of their work , their needed work and their needed par@@ en@@ th@@ o@@ od , is their problem alone ."
"The cat@@ ch is that when this is happening to a new family , it is con@@ sum@@ ing , and a family with a new b@@ aby is more fin@@ an@@ cially v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able than they &apos;ve ever been before , so that new mother cannot af@@ for@@ d to speak up on her own be@@ half ."
But all of us have vo@@ i@@ ces .
"I am done , done having b@@ ab@@ ies , and you might be pre@@ -@@ b@@ aby , you might be post@@ -@@ b@@ aby , you might be no b@@ aby ."
It should not matter .
"We have to stop fra@@ ming this as a mother &apos;s issue , or even a women &apos;s issue ."
This is an American issue .
We need to stop bu@@ ying the lie that these images tell us .
We need to stop being comfor@@ ted by them .
We need to question why we &apos;re told that this can &apos;t work when we see it work every@@ where all over the world .
We need to re@@ cogni@@ ze that this American re@@ ality is to our di@@ sh@@ on@@ or and to our per@@ il .
"Because this is not , this is not , and this is not what a working mother looks like ."
( Applause )
I &apos;ve actually been wai@@ ting by the phone for a call from TED for years .
"And in fact , in 2@@ 000 , I was ready to talk about e@@ B@@ ay , but no call ."
"In 200@@ 3 , I was ready to do a talk about the S@@ kol@@ l F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation and social ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship . No call ."
"In 200@@ 4 , I started P@@ arti@@ ci@@ p@@ ant Pro@@ du@@ ctions and we had a really good first year , and no call ."
"And finally , I get a call last year , and then I have to go up after J@@ .@@ J@@ . A@@ bra@@ ms ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ve got a c@@ ru@@ el sense of hu@@ mo@@ r , TED . ( Laughter )"
"When I first mo@@ ved to H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood from S@@ i@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ ley , I had some mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings ."
But I found that there were some adv@@ an@@ t@@ ages to being in H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood .
"( Laughter ) And , in fact , some adv@@ an@@ t@@ ages to ow@@ ning your own media company ."
And I also found that H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood and S@@ i@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ ley have a lot more in common than I would have dre@@ am@@ ed .
"H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood has its se@@ x sym@@ b@@ ols , and the V@@ al@@ ley has its se@@ x sym@@ b@@ ols ."
"( Laughter ) H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood has its ri@@ val@@ r@@ ies , and the V@@ al@@ ley has its ri@@ val@@ r@@ ies ."
"H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood ga@@ thers around power tab@@ les , and the V@@ al@@ ley ga@@ thers around power tab@@ les ."
So it turned out there was a lot more in common than I would have dre@@ am@@ ed .
But I &apos;m actually here today to tell a story .
"And part of it is a per@@ s@@ onal story . When Ch@@ ris in@@ vi@@ ted me to speak , he said , people think of you as a bit of an eni@@ g@@ ma , and they want to know what dri@@ ves you a bit ."
And what really dri@@ ves me is a vision of the future that I think we all share .
It &apos;s a world of pe@@ ace and pro@@ sp@@ eri@@ ty and susta@@ in@@ ability .
"And when we heard a lot of the pres@@ ent@@ ations over the last couple of days , E@@ d W@@ il@@ son and the pi@@ ctures of J@@ am@@ es N@@ ach@@ t@@ we@@ y , I think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new ver@@ sion of hum@@ ani@@ ty that I like to call &quot; &quot; H@@ um@@ ani@@ ty 2@@ .@@ 0 . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s also something that resi@@ des in each of us , to close what I think are the two big cal@@ am@@ it@@ ies in the world today ."
"One is the ga@@ p in opportunity — this ga@@ p that P@@ resi@@ dent C@@ lin@@ ton last night called u@@ ne@@ ven , un@@ fa@@ ir and un@@ susta@@ in@@ able — and , out of that , comes po@@ ver@@ ty and il@@ liter@@ acy and dise@@ ase and all these evi@@ ls that we see around us ."
"But per@@ haps the other , bi@@ g@@ ger ga@@ p is what we call the hope ga@@ p ."
"And someone , at some point , came up with this very bad idea that an ordin@@ ary individu@@ al couldn &apos;t make a difference in the world ."
And I think that &apos;s just a hor@@ ri@@ ble thing .
"And so ch@@ ap@@ ter one really begin@@ s today , with all of us , because within each of us is the power to equ@@ al those opportunity g@@ ap@@ s and to close the hope g@@ ap@@ s ."
"And if the men and women of TED can &apos;t make a difference in the world , I don &apos;t know who can ."
"And for me , a lot of this started when I was youn@@ ger and my family used to go cam@@ ping in up@@ state New York ."
"And there really wasn &apos;t much to do there for the sum@@ m@@ er , ex@@ cept get be@@ at@@ en up by my si@@ ster or read boo@@ ks ."
And so I used to read au@@ th@@ ors like J@@ am@@ es Mi@@ ch@@ en@@ er and J@@ am@@ es C@@ la@@ ve@@ ll and A@@ y@@ n R@@ and .
And their stories made the world se@@ em a very small and inter@@ conne@@ cted place .
"And it stru@@ ck me that if I could write stories that were about this world as being small and inter@@ conne@@ cted , that maybe I could get people interested in the issu@@ es that af@@ fe@@ cted us all , and maybe eng@@ age them to make a difference ."
"I didn &apos;t think that was ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly the best way to make a living , so I decided to go on a pat@@ h to become fin@@ an@@ cially in@@ depen@@ dent , so I could write these stories as quickly as I could ."
I then had a bit of a wa@@ ke@@ -@@ up call when I was 14 .
"And my d@@ ad came home one day and an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced that he had can@@ cer , and it looked pretty bad ."
"And what he said was , he wasn &apos;t so much af@@ ra@@ id that he might die , but that he ha@@ dn &apos;t done the things that he wanted to with his life ."
"And k@@ no@@ ck on wood , he &apos;s still ali@@ ve today , many years later ."
"But for a young man that made a real im@@ pres@@ sion on me , that one never know@@ s how much time one really has ."
So I set out in a h@@ ur@@ ry . I stud@@ ied engine@@ ering .
I started a couple of bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es that I thought would be the ti@@ ck@@ et to fin@@ an@@ cial fre@@ e@@ dom .
"One of those bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es was a computer r@@ ent@@ al business called Mi@@ cro@@ s on the Mo@@ ve , which is very well na@@ med , because people ke@@ pt ste@@ al@@ ing the compu@@ ters ."
"( Laughter ) So I figu@@ red I needed to learn a little bit more about business , so I went to St@@ an@@ for@@ d B@@ us@@ iness S@@ cho@@ ol and stud@@ ied there ."
"And while I was there , I made friends with a fel@@ low na@@ med P@@ ier@@ re O@@ mi@@ dy@@ ar , who is here today . And P@@ ier@@ re , I apo@@ logi@@ ze for this . This is a ph@@ oto from the old days ."
"And just after I &apos;d gra@@ du@@ ated , P@@ ier@@ re came to me with this idea to help people bu@@ y and se@@ ll things on@@ line with each other ."
"And with the wi@@ s@@ dom of my St@@ an@@ for@@ d de@@ gre@@ e , I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ ier@@ re , what a stu@@ pi@@ d idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And need@@ less to say , I was right . ( Laughter )"
"But right after that , P@@ ier@@ re — in &apos; 9@@ 6 , P@@ ier@@ re and I left our fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time j@@ ob@@ s to build e@@ B@@ ay as a company . And the rest of that story , you know ."
The company went public two years later and is today one of the best known comp@@ an@@ ies in the world .
"H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of mi@@ llions of people use it in hundre@@ ds of countries , and so on ."
"But for me , per@@ son@@ ally , it was a real change ."
"I went from living in a house with five guys in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to and living off their le@@ f@@ to@@ ver@@ s , to all of a sud@@ den having all kinds of re@@ sources ."
And I wanted to figure out how I could take the bl@@ ess@@ ing of these re@@ sources and share it with the world .
"And around that time , I met Joh@@ n G@@ ar@@ d@@ ner , who is a re@@ mark@@ able man ."
He was the archite@@ ct of the Gre@@ at S@@ o@@ cie@@ ty progra@@ ms under L@@ y@@ n@@ don Joh@@ n@@ son in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s .
"And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do , or any@@ one could do , to make a difference in the lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m issu@@ es fac@@ ing hum@@ ani@@ ty ."
"And Joh@@ n said , &quot; &quot; B@@ et on good people doing good things ."
B@@ et on good people doing good things . &quot; &quot; And that really re@@ son@@ ated with me .
I started a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation to be@@ t on these good people doing good things .
"These le@@ ading , in@@ no@@ v@@ ative , n@@ on@@ prof@@ it fol@@ ks , who are using business sk@@ il@@ ls in a very le@@ ver@@ aged way to sol@@ ve social problems ."
Pe@@ ople today we call social ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s .
"And to put a face on it , people like Mu@@ ha@@ m@@ ma@@ d Y@@ un@@ us , who started the G@@ ra@@ me@@ en B@@ ank , has li@@ f@@ ted 100 million people p@@ lu@@ s out of po@@ ver@@ ty around the world , won the N@@ obe@@ l Pe@@ ace P@@ ri@@ ze ."
But there &apos;s also a lot of people that you don &apos;t know .
"F@@ ol@@ ks like An@@ n C@@ ot@@ ton , who started a group called C@@ A@@ M@@ F@@ E@@ D in Africa , because she felt girls &apos; education was l@@ ag@@ g@@ ing ."
"And she started it about 10 years ago , and today , she edu@@ c@@ ates over a qu@@ ar@@ ter million Afri@@ can girls ."
"And somebody like D@@ r. V@@ i@@ ct@@ or@@ ia H@@ ale , who started the world &apos;s first n@@ on@@ prof@@ it ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ tical company , and wh@@ ose first dru@@ g will be fi@@ gh@@ ting vi@@ sc@@ er@@ al le@@ i@@ sh@@ m@@ ani@@ a@@ sis , also known as black fe@@ ver ."
"And by 20@@ 10 , she hop@@ es to e@@ li@@ min@@ ate this dise@@ ase , which is really a sc@@ our@@ ge in the develo@@ ping world ."
And so this is one way to be@@ t on good people doing good things .
And a lot of this comes together in a phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y of change that I find really is powerful .
"It &apos;s what we call , &quot; &quot; In@@ v@@ est , conne@@ ct and ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate . &quot; &quot; And inv@@ est : if you see good people doing good things , inv@@ est in them . In@@ v@@ est in their organiz@@ ations , or in business . In@@ v@@ est in these fol@@ ks ."
"C@@ on@@ ne@@ cting them together through con@@ fer@@ ences — like a TED — br@@ ings so many powerful conne@@ ctions , or through the World F@@ or@@ um on S@@ o@@ cial En@@ tre@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship that my f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation does at O@@ x@@ for@@ d every year ."
"And ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate them : tell their stories , because not only are there good people doing good work , but their stories can help close these g@@ ap@@ s of hope ."
"And it was this last part of the mis@@ sion , the ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate part , that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid and wanted to tell stories to get people inv@@ olved in the issu@@ es that af@@ fe@@ ct us all ."
"And a light bu@@ l@@ b went off , which was , first , that I didn &apos;t actually have to do the writing myself , I could find wri@@ ters ."
"And then the next light bu@@ l@@ b was , better than just writing , what about film and T@@ V , to get out to people in a big way ?"
"And I thought about the fil@@ ms that inspi@@ red me , fil@@ ms like &quot; &quot; G@@ and@@ h@@ i &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; S@@ ch@@ in@@ d@@ ler &apos;s Li@@ st . &quot; &quot; And I wonder@@ ed who was doing these kinds of fil@@ ms today ."
And there really wasn &apos;t a speci@@ fic company that was fo@@ c@@ used on the public inter@@ est .
"So , in 200@@ 3 , I started to make my way around L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les to talk about the idea of a pro@@ -@@ social media company and I was met with a lot of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement ."
"One of the lin@@ es of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement that I heard over and over was , &quot; &quot; The stre@@ ets of H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood are lit@@ ter@@ ed with the car@@ c@@ as@@ ses of people like you , who think you &apos;re going to come to this tow@@ n and make mov@@ ies . &quot; &quot; And then of course , there was the other ad@@ age ."
"&quot; &quot; The su@@ rest way to become a mi@@ lli@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ re is to start by being a bi@@ lli@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ re and go into the movie business . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) U@@ n@@ de@@ ter@@ red , in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary of 200@@ 4 , I started P@@ arti@@ ci@@ p@@ ant Pro@@ du@@ ctions with the vision to be a global media company fo@@ c@@ used on the public inter@@ est ."
And our mis@@ sion is to produ@@ ce en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment that cre@@ ates and inspi@@ res social change .
"And we don &apos;t just want people to see our mov@@ ies and say , that was fun , and for@@ get about it ."
We want them to actually get inv@@ olved in the issu@@ es .
"In 200@@ 5 , we la@@ un@@ ched our first sl@@ ate of fil@@ ms , &quot; M@@ ur@@ der B@@ all , &quot; &quot; Nor@@ th C@@ oun@@ try , &quot; &quot; Sy@@ ri@@ ana &quot; and &quot; &quot; Go@@ od N@@ ight and Go@@ od Lu@@ ck . &quot; &quot; And much to my sur@@ pri@@ se , they were noti@@ ced ."
We en@@ ded up with 11 O@@ s@@ car n@@ om@@ in@@ ations for these fil@@ ms .
And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy .
"P@@ er@@ haps more import@@ an@@ tly , ten@@ s of thousands of people jo@@ ined the adv@@ oc@@ acy progra@@ ms and the acti@@ vi@@ sm progra@@ ms that we created to go around the mov@@ ies ."
"And we had an on@@ line com@@ pon@@ ent of that , our community se@@ ct called P@@ arti@@ ci@@ pat@@ e@@ .@@ net@@ ."
"But with our social se@@ ctor part@@ n@@ ers , like the A@@ C@@ L@@ U and P@@ B@@ S and the S@@ ier@@ ra C@@ lub and the N@@ R@@ D@@ C , once people saw the film , there was actually something they could do to make a difference ."
"One of these fil@@ ms in particular , called &quot; &quot; Nor@@ th C@@ oun@@ try , &quot; &quot; was actually kind of a box offi@@ ce disa@@ ster ."
"But it was a film that star@@ red Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ ze Th@@ er@@ on and it was about women &apos;s ri@@ ghts , women &apos;s em@@ power@@ ment , dom@@ esti@@ c violence and so on ."
And we rele@@ as@@ ed the film at the same time that the Con@@ gre@@ ss was de@@ b@@ ating the r@@ ene@@ wa@@ l of the V@@ i@@ ol@@ ence A@@ ga@@ inst W@@ om@@ en A@@ ct .
"And with scre@@ en@@ ings on the Hi@@ ll , and di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions , and with our social se@@ ctor part@@ n@@ ers , like the N@@ ational O@@ r@@ gani@@ z@@ ation of W@@ om@@ en , the film was wi@@ de@@ ly cre@@ di@@ ted with in@@ flu@@ en@@ cing the suc@@ cess@@ ful r@@ ene@@ wa@@ l of the act ."
"And that to me , spo@@ ke vol@@ um@@ es , because it &apos;s — the film started about a tru@@ e-@@ life story about a woman who was har@@ as@@ sed , su@@ ed her em@@ plo@@ y@@ er , led to a land@@ mar@@ k case that led to the E@@ qu@@ al O@@ p@@ portuni@@ ty A@@ ct , and the V@@ i@@ ol@@ ence A@@ ga@@ inst W@@ om@@ en A@@ ct and others ."
"And then the movie about this person doing these things , then led to this gre@@ ater r@@ ene@@ wa@@ l ."
"And so again , it goes back to bet@@ ting on good people doing good things ."
"S@@ pe@@ aking of which , our fel@@ low TE@@ D@@ ster , A@@ l — I first saw A@@ l do his sli@@ de show pres@@ ent@@ ation on global war@@ ming in M@@ ay of 200@@ 5 ."
"A@@ t that point , I thought I knew something about global war@@ ming ."
I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem .
"And after we saw his sli@@ de show , it became clear that it was much more ur@@ g@@ ent ."
"And so right af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds , I met back@@ st@@ age with A@@ l , and with L@@ aw@@ r@@ ence B@@ en@@ der , who was there , and L@@ au@@ r@@ ie Davi@@ d , and D@@ av@@ is G@@ u@@ g@@ gen@@ he@@ im , who was ru@@ n@@ ning do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ar@@ ies for P@@ arti@@ ci@@ p@@ ant at the time ."
"And with A@@ l &apos;s bl@@ ess@@ ing , we decided on the spo@@ t to turn it into a film , because we felt that we could get the mess@@ age out there far more quickly than having A@@ l go around the world , spe@@ aking to aud@@ ien@@ ces of 100 or 2@@ 00 at a time ."
"And you know , there &apos;s another ad@@ age in H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood , that no@@ body know@@ s nothing about anything ."
And I really thought this was going to be a stra@@ igh@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ P@@ B@@ S char@@ it@@ able ini@@ ti@@ ative .
"And so it was a great sho@@ ck to all of us when the film really cap@@ tu@@ red the public inter@@ est , and today is m@@ and@@ at@@ ory vie@@ w@@ ing in scho@@ ols in En@@ gl@@ and and S@@ c@@ ot@@ land , and most of S@@ c@@ and@@ in@@ avi@@ a ."
"We &apos;ve s@@ ent 5@@ 0,000 D@@ V@@ D@@ s to high school teach@@ ers in the U.@@ S@@ ."
and it &apos;s really changed the de@@ b@@ ate on global war@@ ming .
It was also a pretty good year for this guy .
We now call A@@ l the G@@ e@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey of global war@@ ming .
"( Laughter ) And for P@@ arti@@ ci@@ p@@ ant , this is just the start ."
E@@ very@@ thing we do looks at the major issu@@ es in the world .
"And we have 10 fil@@ ms in produ@@ ction right now , and do@@ z@@ ens others in develo@@ pment ."
I &apos;ll quickly talk about a few coming up .
"One is &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ar@@ lie W@@ il@@ son &apos;s W@@ ar , &quot; &quot; with T@@ om H@@ an@@ ks and Ju@@ li@@ a Rob@@ er@@ ts ."
"And it &apos;s the true story of Con@@ gre@@ s@@ s@@ man Ch@@ ar@@ lie W@@ il@@ son , and how he fun@@ ded the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an to fi@@ ght the R@@ us@@ si@@ ans in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan ."
"And we &apos;re also doing a movie called &quot; &quot; The K@@ i@@ te R@@ un@@ ner , &quot; &quot; based on the book &quot; &quot; The K@@ i@@ te R@@ un@@ ner , &quot; &quot; also about Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan ."
"And we think once people see these fil@@ ms , they &apos;ll have a much better under@@ standing of that part of the world and the Mi@@ ddle E@@ ast in gener@@ al ."
We pre@@ mie@@ red a film called &quot; &quot; The Chi@@ ca@@ go 10 &quot; &quot; at S@@ un@@ dance this year .
"It &apos;s based on the prote@@ st@@ ers at the De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic Con@@ ven@@ tion in 19@@ 6@@ 8 , A@@ b@@ by H@@ of@@ f@@ man and cre@@ w , and , again , a story about a small group of individu@@ als who did make change in the world ."
And a do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ary that we &apos;re doing on J@@ im@@ my C@@ ar@@ ter and his Mi@@ d-@@ E@@ ast pe@@ ace ef@@ for@@ ts over the years .
"And in particular , we &apos;ve been fol@@ low@@ ing him on his re@@ cent book t@@ our , which , as many of you know , has been very n@@ on-@@ contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al — ( Laughter ) — which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie ."
"In clo@@ sing , I &apos;d like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way ."
"And all the people in this room have done so through their business lives , or their ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pi@@ c work , or their other interest@@ s ."
And one thing that I &apos;ve learned is that there &apos;s never one right way to make change .
"One can do it as a te@@ ch person , or as a fin@@ ance person , or a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it person , or as an en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment person , but every one of us is all of those things and more ."
"And I believe if we do these things , we can close the opportunity g@@ ap@@ s , we can close the hope g@@ ap@@ s ."
"And I can imagine , if we do this , the he@@ ad@@ lin@@ es in 10 years might read something like these : &quot; New AIDS C@@ ases in Africa F@@ all to Z@@ er@@ o , &quot; &quot; &quot; U.@@ S.

"And I believe that , working together , we can make all of these things happen ."
And I want to th@@ ank you all for having me here today .
It &apos;s been a real hon@@ or . Thank you .
"( Applause ) Oh , th@@ ank you ."
Let me tell you a story .
"In the course of maybe a thous@@ and li@@ fe@@ times , it could ev@@ ol@@ ve a new fi@@ x@@ ed behavi@@ or ."
That was perfe@@ ct@@ ly o@@ kay 2@@ 00 million years ago .
We call it the C@@ re@@ t@@ ace@@ ous ex@@ t@@ in@@ ction ev@@ ent .
It could learn a pat@@ ter@@ n . It could remember a pat@@ ter@@ n .
S@@ p@@ ati@@ al re@@ solution of bra@@ in@@ sc@@ an@@ ning of all typ@@ es is d@@ ou@@ b@@ ling every year .
So let me descri@@ be br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly how it works .
I &apos;ll give you a simple example .
"E@@ ach is more ab@@ strac@@ t than the next one , so the next one might say &quot; &quot; ca@@ pi@@ tal A@@ . &quot; &quot; That goes up to a high@@ er level that might say &quot; &quot; A@@ pp@@ le . &quot; &quot; In@@ form@@ ation f@@ low@@ s down also ."
"So at first they thought they were tri@@ gg@@ ering some kind of l@@ au@@ gh ref@@ le@@ x , but no , they quickly realized they had found the poin@@ ts in her ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x that de@@ te@@ ct hu@@ mo@@ r , and she just found everything h@@ il@@ ari@@ ous wh@@ en@@ ever they sti@@ mu@@ lated these poin@@ ts ."
So how are we doing today ?
"&quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy &quot; &quot; is a very bro@@ ad natural language g@@ ame , and W@@ at@@ son got a high@@ er sc@@ ore than the best two pla@@ y@@ ers com@@ b@@ ined ."
It &apos;ll be ex@@ pan@@ ded without lim@@ it .
"I essen@@ ti@@ ally dra@@ g sle@@ d@@ ges for a living , so it doesn &apos;t take an aw@@ ful lot to flu@@ m@@ mo@@ x me in@@ tel@@ le@@ c@@ tually , but I &apos;m going to read this question from an inter@@ view ear@@ lie@@ r this year : &quot; &quot; P@@ hi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ hi@@ cally , does the con@@ st@@ ant su@@ pp@@ ly of information ste@@ al our ability to imagine or re@@ place our dre@@ am@@ s of ach@@ ie@@ ving ?"
"A@@ f@@ ter all , if it is being done some@@ where by someone , and we can parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate vi@@ r@@ tually , then why bo@@ ther lea@@ ving the house ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m usu@@ ally in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced as a pol@@ ar ex@@ plo@@ re@@ r ."
"I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the most pro@@ gre@@ s@@ sive or 2@@ 1@@ st@@ -@@ century of job ti@@ t@@ les , but I &apos;ve spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a t@@ ent inside the Ar@@ cti@@ c C@@ ir@@ cle , so I get out of the house a fa@@ ir bit ."
"And in my nature , I gu@@ ess , I am a do@@ er of things more than I am a spe@@ ct@@ ator or a con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ator of things , and it &apos;s that di@@ ch@@ ot@@ om@@ y , the gu@@ l@@ f between ideas and action that I &apos;m going to try and expl@@ ore br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly ."
"The pi@@ th@@ ie@@ st answer to the question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; that &apos;s been do@@ gg@@ ing me for the last 12 years was cre@@ di@@ ted cer@@ tain@@ ly to this cha@@ p , the ra@@ ki@@ sh@@ -@@ looking g@@ ent@@ le@@ man standing at the back , second from the left , G@@ e@@ or@@ ge Le@@ e M@@ al@@ l@@ ory . M@@ any of you will know his name ."
In 19@@ 2@@ 4 he was last seen disa@@ p@@ pe@@ aring into the cl@@ ou@@ ds ne@@ ar the sum@@ m@@ it of M@@ t . E@@ ver@@ est .
"He may or may not have been the first person to clim@@ b E@@ ver@@ est , more than 30 years before E@@ d@@ mu@@ nd H@@ il@@ lar@@ y ."
No one know@@ s if he got to the top . It &apos;s still a m@@ yst@@ ery .
"But he was cre@@ di@@ ted with co@@ ining the ph@@ ra@@ se , &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s there . &quot; &quot; Now I &apos;m not actually sure that he did say that ."
"There &apos;s very little evi@@ dence to su@@ ggest it , but what he did say is actually far nic@@ er , and again , I &apos;ve prin@@ ted this . I &apos;m going to read it out ."
&quot; &quot; The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this : What is the use of clim@@ b@@ ing M@@ t . E@@ ver@@ est ?
"And my answer must at once be , it is no use ."
There is not the sli@@ gh@@ test pro@@ spe@@ ct of any ga@@ in wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever .
"O@@ h , we may learn a little about the behavi@@ or of the human body at high al@@ ti@@ tu@@ des , and possi@@ bly medi@@ cal men may turn our obser@@ vation to some ac@@ coun@@ t for the pur@@ pos@@ es of avi@@ ation , but o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se nothing will come of it ."
"We sh@@ all not bring back a single bit of g@@ old or sil@@ ver , and not a g@@ em , no@@ r any co@@ al or i@@ ro@@ n ."
We sh@@ all not find a single fo@@ ot of ear@@ th that can be plan@@ ted with cro@@ ps to ra@@ ise food . So it is no use .
"If you cannot understand that there is something in man which respon@@ ds to the challen@@ ge of this m@@ oun@@ tain and goes out to me@@ et it , that the stru@@ gg@@ le is the stru@@ gg@@ le of life itself up@@ ward and fore@@ ver up@@ ward , then you won &apos;t see why we go ."
"What we get from this ad@@ ven@@ ture is just sh@@ e@@ er jo@@ y , and jo@@ y , after all , is the end of life ."
We don &apos;t live to e@@ at and make money .
We e@@ at and make money to be able to en@@ jo@@ y life .
"That is what life means , and that is what life is for . &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ l@@ ory &apos;s ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent that lea@@ ving the house , em@@ bar@@ king on these gr@@ and ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ res is jo@@ y@@ ful and fun , h@@ ow@@ ever , doesn &apos;t t@@ ally that ne@@ at@@ ly with my own experience ."
"The f@@ ur@@ th@@ est I &apos;ve ever got away from my front door was in the sp@@ ring of 200@@ 4 . I still don &apos;t know exactly what came over me , but my pl@@ an was to make a sol@@ o and un@@ sup@@ por@@ ted cro@@ s@@ sing of the Ar@@ cti@@ c O@@ ce@@ an ."
"I plan@@ ned essen@@ ti@@ ally to walk from the nor@@ th co@@ ast of R@@ us@@ si@@ a to the Nor@@ th Po@@ le , and then to car@@ ry on to the nor@@ th co@@ ast of C@@ an@@ ada ."
No one had ever done this . I was 2@@ 6 at the time .
"A lot of exper@@ ts were saying it was im@@ possible , and my mu@@ m cer@@ tain@@ ly wasn &apos;t very ke@@ en on the idea ."
"( Laughter ) The jour@@ ney from a small we@@ a@@ ther st@@ ation on the nor@@ th co@@ ast of S@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ a up to my fin@@ al star@@ ting point , the ed@@ ge of the p@@ ack ice , the co@@ ast of the Ar@@ cti@@ c O@@ ce@@ an , took about five hours , and if any@@ one wat@@ ched fe@@ ar@@ less F@@ e@@ li@@ x B@@ au@@ m@@ gar@@ t@@ ner going up , rather than just coming down , you &apos;ll ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate the sense of ap@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sion , as I s@@ at in a he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter th@@ under@@ ing nor@@ th , and the sense , I think if anything , of im@@ pen@@ ding do@@ om ."
I s@@ at there wonder@@ ing what on Earth I had got@@ ten myself into .
"There was a bit of fun , a bit of jo@@ y ."
"I was 2@@ 6 . I remember sitting there looking down at my sle@@ dge . I had my sk@@ is ready to go , I had a s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te phone , a pu@@ m@@ p@@ -@@ action sh@@ ot@@ gu@@ n in case I was att@@ ac@@ ked by a pol@@ ar be@@ ar ."
I remember looking out of the win@@ do@@ w and seeing the second he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter .
"We were both th@@ under@@ ing through this incredible S@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ an daw@@ n , and part of me felt a bit like a c@@ ross between J@@ as@@ on B@@ our@@ ne and W@@ il@@ f@@ red Th@@ e@@ sig@@ er . P@@ art of me felt quite pro@@ u@@ d of myself , but mo@@ st@@ ly I was just ut@@ ter@@ ly terri@@ f@@ ied ."
"And that jour@@ ney la@@ st@@ ed 10 weeks , 7@@ 2 days ."
I didn &apos;t see any@@ one else . We took this ph@@ oto next to the he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter .
"B@@ ey@@ ond that , I didn &apos;t see any@@ one for 10 weeks ."
"The Nor@@ th Po@@ le is s@@ la@@ p ban@@ g in the mi@@ ddle of the se@@ a , so I &apos;m tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing over the f@@ roz@@ en surface of the Ar@@ cti@@ c O@@ ce@@ an ."
N@@ A@@ SA descri@@ bed con@@ di@@ tions that year as the wor@@ st since recor@@ ds began .
"I was dra@@ gg@@ ing 1@@ 80 ki@@ lo@@ s of food and fu@@ el and sup@@ pl@@ ies , about 4@@ 00 po@@ un@@ ds . The a@@ ver@@ age temper@@ ature for the 10 weeks was min@@ us 3@@ 5 . M@@ in@@ us 50 was the col@@ d@@ est ."
"So again , there wasn &apos;t an aw@@ ful lot of jo@@ y or fun to be had ."
"One of the mag@@ i@@ cal things about this jour@@ ney , h@@ ow@@ ever , is that because I &apos;m wal@@ king over the se@@ a , over this flo@@ ating , dri@@ f@@ ting , shi@@ f@@ ting c@@ r@@ ust of ice that &apos;s flo@@ ating on top of the Ar@@ cti@@ c O@@ ce@@ an is it &apos;s an environment that &apos;s in a con@@ st@@ ant state of flu@@ x ."
"The ice is always moving , bre@@ aking up , dri@@ f@@ ting around , re@@ fre@@ e@@ z@@ ing , so the sc@@ ener@@ y that I saw for ne@@ ar@@ ly 3 months was uni@@ qu@@ e to me . No one else will ever , could ever , possi@@ bly see the vie@@ ws , the vi@@ st@@ as , that I saw for 10 weeks ."
"And that , I gu@@ ess , is probably the fin@@ est ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent for lea@@ ving the house ."
"I can try to tell you what it was like , but you &apos;ll never know what it was like , and the more I try to expla@@ in that I felt lon@@ ely , I was the only human being in 5@@ .@@ 4 million squ@@ are@@ -@@ miles , it was c@@ old , ne@@ ar@@ ly min@@ us 7@@ 5 with win@@ d@@ chi@@ ll on a bad day , the more words f@@ all shor@@ t , and I &apos;m u@@ na@@ ble to do it ju@@ sti@@ ce ."
"And it seem@@ s to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , that the doing , you know , to try to experience , to eng@@ age , to en@@ de@@ av@@ or , rather than to wat@@ ch and to won@@ der , that &apos;s where the real me@@ at of life is to be found , the ju@@ ice that we can su@@ ck out of our hours and days ."
"And I would ad@@ d a ca@@ u@@ tion@@ ary not@@ e here , h@@ ow@@ ever ."
"In my experience , there is something ad@@ di@@ ctive about ta@@ st@@ ing life at the very ed@@ ge of what &apos;s hum@@ an@@ ly possible ."
"Now I don &apos;t just mean in the fie@@ ld of d@@ af@@ t mach@@ o E@@ d@@ war@@ di@@ an sty@@ le der@@ r@@ ing@@ -@@ do , but also in the fie@@ l@@ ds of pan@@ cre@@ atic can@@ cer , there is something ad@@ di@@ ctive about this , and in my case , I think pol@@ ar expe@@ di@@ tions are per@@ haps not that far re@@ mo@@ ved from having a c@@ rac@@ k ha@@ bit ."
"I can &apos;t expla@@ in quite how good it is until you &apos;ve tr@@ ied it , but it has the ca@@ pac@@ ity to bur@@ n up all the money I can get my h@@ ands on , to ru@@ in every relation@@ ship I &apos;ve ever had , so be car@@ e@@ ful what you wi@@ sh for ."
"M@@ al@@ l@@ ory po@@ stu@@ lated that there is something in man that respon@@ ds to the challen@@ ge of the m@@ oun@@ tain , and I won@@ der if that &apos;s the case whether there &apos;s something in the challen@@ ge itself , in the en@@ de@@ av@@ or , and parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly in the big , un@@ fini@@ shed , ch@@ un@@ k@@ y challen@@ ges that face hum@@ ani@@ ty that call out to us , and in my experience that &apos;s cer@@ tain@@ ly the case ."
There is one un@@ fini@@ shed challen@@ ge that &apos;s been cal@@ ling out to me for most of my ad@@ ul@@ t life .
M@@ any of you will know the story .
This is a ph@@ oto of C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ c@@ ot@@ t and his team .
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t set out just over a hundre@@ d years ago to try to become the first person to re@@ ach the S@@ outh Po@@ le .
No one knew what was there . It was ut@@ ter@@ ly un@@ ma@@ pped at the time . We knew more about the surface of the mo@@ on than we did about the heart of An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca .
"S@@ c@@ ot@@ t , as many of you will know , was be@@ at@@ en to it by Ro@@ al@@ d A@@ mu@@ n@@ d@@ s@@ en and his Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an team , who used do@@ gs and do@@ g@@ sle@@ ds . S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s team were on fo@@ ot , all five of them we@@ aring har@@ n@@ ess@@ es and dra@@ gg@@ ing around sle@@ d@@ ges , and they ar@@ ri@@ ved at the po@@ le to find the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an f@@ la@@ g already there , I &apos;d imagine pretty bi@@ t@@ ter and de@@ mor@@ aliz@@ ed ."
All five of them turned and started wal@@ king back to the co@@ ast and all five d@@ ied on that re@@ turn jour@@ ney .
There is a sort of mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tion now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys that it &apos;s all been done in the fie@@ l@@ ds of expl@@ or@@ ation and ad@@ ven@@ ture .
"When I talk about An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca , people often say , &quot; &quot; H@@ as@@ n &apos;t , you know , that &apos;s interesting , ha@@ sn &apos;t that B@@ lu@@ e Pe@@ ter pre@@ sen@@ ter just done it on a bi@@ ke ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s nice . You know , my grand@@ mother &apos;s going on a c@@ ru@@ ise to An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca next year . You know ."
Is there a ch@@ ance you &apos;ll see her there ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s jour@@ ney re@@ ma@@ ins un@@ fini@@ shed .
No one has ever wal@@ ked from the very co@@ ast of An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca to the S@@ outh Po@@ le and back again .
"It is , ar@@ gu@@ ably , the most aud@@ aci@@ ous en@@ de@@ av@@ or of that E@@ d@@ war@@ di@@ an g@@ ol@@ den age of expl@@ or@@ ation , and it seem@@ ed to me high time , given everything we have figu@@ red out in the century since from s@@ cur@@ v@@ y to solar pan@@ els , that it was high time someone had a go at fini@@ sh@@ ing the job ."
So that &apos;s pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly what I &apos;m se@@ tting out to do .
"This time next year , in O@@ c@@ to@@ ber , I &apos;m le@@ ading a team of three ."
It will take us about four months to make this re@@ turn jour@@ ney .
That &apos;s the scale . The red line is obvi@@ ously hal@@ f@@ way to the po@@ le .
We have to turn around and come back again .
I &apos;m well aw@@ are of the i@@ ro@@ ny of tel@@ ling you that we will be blo@@ gg@@ ing and t@@ wee@@ ting . You &apos;ll be able to live vi@@ car@@ i@@ ously and vi@@ r@@ tually through this jour@@ ney in a way that no one has ever before .
"And it &apos;ll also be a f@@ our@@ -@@ mon@@ th ch@@ ance for me to finally come up with a pi@@ th@@ y answer to the question , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; And our lives today are sa@@ f@@ er and more comfor@@ table than they have ever been . There cer@@ tain@@ ly isn &apos;t much call for expl@@ or@@ ers now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys . My car@@ e@@ er ad@@ vi@@ s@@ or at school never men@@ tion@@ ed it as an op@@ tion ."
"If I wanted to know , for example , how many star@@ s were in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , how old those gi@@ ant he@@ ads on E@@ ast@@ er Is@@ land were , most of you could find that out right now without even standing up ."
"And yet , if I &apos;ve learned anything in ne@@ ar@@ ly 12 years now of dra@@ gg@@ ing he@@ av@@ y things around c@@ old places , it is that true , real in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation and grow@@ th only comes from ad@@ versity and from challen@@ ge , from ste@@ pping away from what &apos;s comfor@@ table and fami@@ li@@ ar and ste@@ pping out into the un@@ known ."
"In life , we all have tem@@ pe@@ sts to ri@@ de and po@@ les to walk to , and I think me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ori@@ cally spe@@ aking , at least , we could all b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from getting outside the house a little more often , if only we could sum@@ m@@ on up the cou@@ ra@@ ge ."
I cer@@ tain@@ ly would im@@ pl@@ ore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what &apos;s outside .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I learned about the Ha@@ it@@ i ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake by S@@ k@@ y@@ pe .
"My wi@@ fe s@@ ent me a mess@@ age , &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , &quot; and then disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ared for 25 minutes ."
It was 25 minutes of absolu@@ te ter@@ ro@@ r that thousands of people across the U.@@ S. felt .
"I was af@@ ra@@ id of a t@@ su@@ nami ; what I didn &apos;t realize was there was a gre@@ ater ter@@ ro@@ r in Ha@@ it@@ i , and that was building col@@ lap@@ se ."
We &apos;ve all seen the ph@@ ot@@ os of the col@@ lap@@ sed buil@@ dings in Ha@@ it@@ i .
"These are sh@@ ots my wi@@ fe took a couple days after the qu@@ ake , while I was making my way through the D@@ .@@ R@@ . into the country ."
This is the national pal@@ ace — the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of the W@@ hi@@ te H@@ ou@@ se .
This is the largest super@@ market in the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an at pe@@ ak sh@@ op@@ ping time .
This is a n@@ ur@@ ses &apos; colle@@ ge — there are 3@@ 00 n@@ ur@@ ses stu@@ dy@@ ing .
The gener@@ al ho@@ spit@@ al right next door em@@ er@@ g@@ ed lar@@ ge@@ ly un@@ s@@ ca@@ the@@ d .
This is the M@@ in@@ ist@@ ry of E@@ con@@ omi@@ cs and F@@ in@@ ance .
"We have all heard about the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous human lo@@ ss in the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in Ha@@ it@@ i , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t heard enough about why all those lives were lost ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t heard about why the buil@@ dings fai@@ led .
"A@@ f@@ ter all , it was the buil@@ dings , not the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , that kil@@ led 2@@ 20@@ ,000 people , that in@@ ju@@ red 3@@ 3@@ 0,000 , that disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed 1@@ .@@ 3 million people , that cut off food and water and sup@@ pl@@ ies for an entire n@@ ation ."
"This is the largest me@@ tro@@ po@@ lit@@ an@@ -@@ area disa@@ ster in de@@ ca@@ des , and it was not a natural disa@@ ster — it was a disa@@ ster of engine@@ ering ."
"A@@ ID@@ G has worked in Ha@@ it@@ i since 200@@ 7 , provi@@ ding engine@@ ering and business sup@@ port to small bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es ."
"And after the qu@@ ake , we started br@@ ing@@ ing in ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake engine@@ ers to figure out why the buil@@ dings col@@ lap@@ sed , to exam@@ ine what was sa@@ fe and what wasn &apos;t ."
"W@@ or@@ king with M@@ I@@ N@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ A@@ H , which is the U.@@ N@@ . mis@@ sion in Ha@@ it@@ i , with the M@@ in@@ ist@@ ry of P@@ u@@ bli@@ c Wor@@ ks , with different N@@ G@@ O@@ s , we in@@ spe@@ cted over 1@@ ,@@ 500 buil@@ dings ."
We in@@ spe@@ cted scho@@ ols and pri@@ v@@ ate resi@@ den@@ cies .
We in@@ spe@@ cted medi@@ cal cen@@ ters and food war@@ e@@ h@@ ous@@ es .
We in@@ spe@@ cted government buil@@ dings .
This is the M@@ in@@ ist@@ ry of Ju@@ sti@@ ce .
Be@@ hind that door is the N@@ ational Ju@@ di@@ cial Ar@@ chi@@ ves .
"The fel@@ low in the door , An@@ d@@ re F@@ i@@ li@@ tra@@ ul@@ t — who &apos;s the dire@@ ctor of the C@@ enter for Inter@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ ary Ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake En@@ gine@@ ering R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch at the Uni@@ versity of Bu@@ f@@ fal@@ o — was exam@@ ining it to see if it was sa@@ fe to re@@ co@@ ver the archi@@ ves ."
"A@@ n@@ d@@ re told me , after seeing these buil@@ dings fa@@ il again and again in the same way , that there is no new research here ."
There is nothing here that we don &apos;t know .
"The fai@@ lu@@ re poin@@ ts were the same : wal@@ ls and s@@ lab@@ s not t@@ ied pro@@ per@@ ly into col@@ um@@ ns — that &apos;s a ro@@ of s@@ la@@ b h@@ ang@@ ing off the building — can@@ ti@@ le@@ vered stru@@ ctures , or stru@@ ctures that were as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c , that sho@@ ok viol@@ ently and came down , po@@ or building materi@@ als , not enough con@@ cre@@ te , not enough com@@ pres@@ sion in the blo@@ cks , re@@ b@@ ar that was smo@@ ot@@ h , re@@ b@@ ar that was ex@@ posed to the we@@ a@@ ther and had ru@@ st@@ ed away ."
Now there &apos;s a solution to all these problems .
And we know how to build pro@@ per@@ ly .
"The pro@@ of of this came in Chi@@ le , almost a mon@@ th later , when 8@@ .@@ 8 mag@@ ni@@ tu@@ de ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake h@@ it Chi@@ le ."
"That is 500 times the power of the 7@@ .@@ 0 that h@@ it P@@ or@@ t-@@ au@@ -@@ P@@ r@@ in@@ ce — 500 times the power , yet only under a thous@@ and c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ties ."
"A@@ d@@ ju@@ st@@ ed for popul@@ ation den@@ sity , that is less than one percent of the impac@@ t of the Ha@@ i@@ ti@@ an qu@@ ake ."
What was the difference between Chi@@ le and Ha@@ it@@ i ?
"S@@ e@@ is@@ mi@@ c stan@@ dar@@ ds and con@@ fin@@ ed mas@@ on@@ ry , where the building ac@@ ts as a whole — wal@@ ls and col@@ um@@ ns and ro@@ of@@ s and s@@ lab@@ s t@@ ied together to sup@@ port each other — instead of bre@@ aking off into se@@ par@@ ate mem@@ bers and fa@@ il@@ ing ."
"If you look at this building in Chi@@ le , it &apos;s ri@@ pped in half , but it &apos;s not a pi@@ le of ru@@ b@@ ble ."
Chi@@ le@@ ans have been building with con@@ fin@@ ed mas@@ on@@ ry for de@@ ca@@ des .
"R@@ ight now , AID@@ G is working with K@@ P@@ F@@ F Con@@ sul@@ ting En@@ gine@@ ers , Ar@@ chi@@ te@@ cture for H@@ um@@ ani@@ ty , to bring more con@@ fin@@ ed mas@@ on@@ ry tra@@ ining into Ha@@ it@@ i ."
"This is X@@ an@@ tu@@ s D@@ anie@@ l ; he &apos;s a mas@@ on , just a gener@@ al con@@ stru@@ ction wor@@ k@@ er , not a fore@@ man , who took one of our tra@@ in@@ ings ."
"O@@ n his last job he was working with his b@@ os@@ s , and they started po@@ ur@@ ing the col@@ um@@ ns wrong ."
"He took his b@@ os@@ s a@@ side , and he show@@ ed him the materi@@ als on con@@ fin@@ ed mas@@ on@@ ry ."
"He show@@ ed him , &quot; &quot; You know , we don &apos;t have to do this wrong ."
It won &apos;t cost us any more to do it the right way . &quot; &quot; And they re@@ did that building .
"They t@@ ied the re@@ b@@ ar right , they po@@ u@@ red the col@@ um@@ ns right , and that building will be sa@@ fe ."
And every building that they build going forward will be sa@@ fe .
"To make sure these buil@@ dings are sa@@ fe , it &apos;s not going to take poli@@ cy — it &apos;s going to take re@@ ach@@ ing out to the mas@@ ons on the ground and hel@@ ping them learn the pro@@ per techni@@ qu@@ es ."
Now there are many grou@@ ps doing this .
"And the fel@@ low in the v@@ est there , C@@ ra@@ i@@ g T@@ ot@@ en , he has p@@ us@@ h@@ ed forward to get do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ation out to all the grou@@ ps that are doing this ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh Ha@@ it@@ i Re@@ wi@@ red , through Bu@@ ild Ch@@ ange , Ar@@ chi@@ te@@ cture for H@@ um@@ ani@@ ty , AID@@ G , there is the possi@@ bility to re@@ ach out to 3@@ 0,000 — 4@@ 0,000 mas@@ ons across the country and create a movement of pro@@ per building ."
If you re@@ ach out to the people on the ground in this col@@ labor@@ ative way it &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly af@@ for@@ d@@ able .
"For the bi@@ llions spent on re@@ con@@ stru@@ ction , you can tra@@ in mas@@ ons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their li@@ fe@@ time ."
"U@@ l@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , there are two ways that you can re@@ build Ha@@ it@@ i ; the way at the top is the way that Ha@@ it@@ i &apos;s been building for de@@ ca@@ des ."
The way at the top is a po@@ or@@ ly con@@ stru@@ cted building that will fa@@ il .
"The way at the bot@@ tom is a con@@ fin@@ ed mas@@ on@@ ry building , where the wal@@ ls are t@@ ied together , the building is sym@@ me@@ tri@@ c , and it will stand up to an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"For all the disa@@ ster , there is an opportunity here to build better h@@ ous@@ es for the next gener@@ ation , so that when the next ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake hi@@ ts , it is a disa@@ ster — but not a tra@@ ge@@ dy ."

"The H@@ indu@@ s say , &quot; &quot; N@@ ada bra@@ h@@ ma , &quot; &quot; one trans@@ l@@ ation of which is , &quot; &quot; The world is sound . &quot; &quot; And in a way , that &apos;s true , because everything is vi@@ br@@ ating ."
"In fact , all of you as you si@@ t here right now are vi@@ br@@ ating ."
E@@ very part of your body is vi@@ br@@ ating at different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cies .
"So you are , in fact , a ch@@ or@@ d — each of you an individu@@ al ch@@ or@@ d ."
One defini@@ tion of health may be that that ch@@ or@@ d is in comple@@ te har@@ mon@@ y .
Y@@ our ear@@ s can &apos;t hear that ch@@ or@@ d ; they can actually hear amazing things . Y@@ our ear@@ s can hear 10 oc@@ ta@@ ves .
"In@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , we see just one oc@@ ta@@ ve ."
Y@@ our ear@@ s are always on — you have no e@@ ar li@@ ds .
They work even when you sle@@ ep .
The s@@ mal@@ l@@ est sound you can per@@ cei@@ ve mo@@ ves your ear@@ dru@@ m just four at@@ om@@ ic di@@ am@@ e@@ ters .
The l@@ ou@@ d@@ est sound you can hear is a tri@@ llion times more powerful than that .
"E@@ ars are made not for hear@@ ing , but for list@@ ening ."
"L@@ ist@@ ening is an ac@@ tive sk@@ i@@ ll , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as hear@@ ing is pas@@ sive , list@@ ening is something that we have to work at — it &apos;s a relation@@ ship with sound ."
And yet it &apos;s a sk@@ i@@ ll that n@@ one of us are t@@ au@@ ght .
"For example , have you ever consi@@ der@@ ed that there are list@@ ening posi@@ tions , places you can list@@ en from ?"
Here are two of them .
Re@@ du@@ ctive list@@ ening is list@@ ening &quot; &quot; for . &quot; &quot; It redu@@ ces everything down to what &apos;s rele@@ v@@ ant and it di@@ sc@@ ar@@ ds everything that &apos;s not rele@@ v@@ ant .
M@@ en ty@@ pi@@ cally list@@ en redu@@ cti@@ vely .
"So he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got this problem . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s your solution . Th@@ an@@ ks very much . N@@ ex@@ t . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the way we talk , right guys ?"
"E@@ x@@ pan@@ sive list@@ ening , on the other hand , is list@@ ening &quot; &quot; with , &quot; &quot; not list@@ ening &quot; &quot; for . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s got no de@@ st@@ in@@ ation in mind — it &apos;s just en@@ jo@@ ying the jour@@ ney ."
W@@ om@@ en ty@@ pi@@ cally list@@ en ex@@ pan@@ si@@ vely .
"If you look at these two , ey@@ e cont@@ act , fac@@ ing each other , possi@@ bly both talking at the same time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ en , if you get nothing else out of this talk , prac@@ ti@@ ce ex@@ pan@@ sive list@@ ening , and you can trans@@ form your relation@@ ships ."
"The t@@ rou@@ ble with list@@ ening is that so much of what we hear is no@@ ise , sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding us all the time ."
"N@@ o@@ ise like this , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on , is redu@@ cing the health and the qu@@ ality of life of 25 percent of the popul@@ ation of Europ@@ e ."
T@@ wo percent of the popul@@ ation of Europ@@ e — that &apos;s 16 million people — are having their sle@@ ep de@@ v@@ ast@@ ated by no@@ ise like that .
"N@@ o@@ ise kil@@ ls 200@@ ,000 people a year in Europ@@ e ."
It &apos;s a really big problem .
"Now , when you were little , if you had no@@ ise and you didn &apos;t want to hear it , you &apos;d sti@@ ck your fin@@ g@@ ers in your ear@@ s and h@@ um ."
"These days , you can do a si@@ mi@@ lar thing , it just looks a bit co@@ o@@ ler ."
It looks a bit like this .
The t@@ rou@@ ble with wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad he@@ ad@@ phone use is it br@@ ings three really big health issu@@ es .
The first really big health issue is a word that M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y S@@ ch@@ af@@ er co@@ ined : &quot; s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ hon@@ ia . &quot;
It &apos;s a dis@@ lo@@ cation between what you see and what you hear .
"So , we &apos;re in@@ vi@@ ting into our lives the vo@@ i@@ ces of people who are not present with us ."
I think there &apos;s something de@@ e@@ ply un@@ health@@ y about living all the time in s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ hon@@ ia .
The second problem that comes with he@@ ad@@ phone ab@@ use is com@@ pres@@ sion .
We squ@@ as@@ h music to f@@ it it into our po@@ ck@@ et and there is a cost att@@ ach@@ ed to this .
L@@ ist@@ en to this — this is an un@@ com@@ pres@@ sed piece of music .
( Music ) And now the same piece of music with 9@@ 8 percent of the data re@@ mo@@ ved . ( Music )
I do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two .
There is a cost of com@@ pres@@ sion .
It makes you ti@@ red and ir@@ ri@@ table to have to make up all of that data .
You &apos;re having to imagine it .
It &apos;s not good for you in the long run .
The third problem with he@@ ad@@ ph@@ ones is this : de@@ af@@ ness — no@@ i@@ se@@ -@@ indu@@ ced hear@@ ing di@@ sor@@ der .
"T@@ en million Ameri@@ cans already have this for one reason or another , but really wor@@ ry@@ ing@@ ly , 16 percent — rou@@ gh@@ ly one in six — of American te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers su@@ f@@ f@@ er from no@@ i@@ se@@ -@@ indu@@ ced hear@@ ing di@@ sor@@ der as a resul@@ t of he@@ ad@@ phone ab@@ use ."
One study at an American uni@@ versity found that 6@@ 1 percent of colle@@ ge fre@@ sh@@ men had dam@@ aged hear@@ ing as a resul@@ t of he@@ ad@@ phone ab@@ use .
We may be ra@@ is@@ ing an entire gener@@ ation of de@@ a@@ f people .
Now that &apos;s a really seri@@ ous problem .
"I &apos;ll give you three qui@@ ck ti@@ ps to prote@@ ct your ear@@ s and pas@@ s these on to your children , ple@@ ase ."
Pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ onal hear@@ ing prote@@ ct@@ ors are great ; I use some all the time .
"If you &apos;re going to use he@@ ad@@ ph@@ ones , bu@@ y the best ones you can af@@ for@@ d because qu@@ ality means you don &apos;t have to have it so l@@ ou@@ d ."
"If you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a l@@ ou@@ d vo@@ ice , it &apos;s too l@@ ou@@ d ."
"And th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , if you &apos;re in bad sound , it &apos;s f@@ ine to put your fin@@ g@@ ers in your ear@@ s or just move away from it ."
Pro@@ te@@ ct your ear@@ s in that way .
Let &apos;s move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I ur@@ ge you to se@@ ek out .
"W@@ W@@ B : W@@ ind , water , bir@@ ds — sto@@ cha@@ stic natural sounds com@@ posed of lots of individu@@ al ran@@ dom ev@@ ents , all of it very health@@ y , all of it sound that we ev@@ olved to over the years ."
Se@@ ek those sounds out ; they &apos;re good for you and so it this .
S@@ il@@ ence is beautiful .
The E@@ li@@ za@@ be@@ th@@ ans descri@@ bed language as de@@ cor@@ ated sil@@ ence .
I ur@@ ge you to move away from sil@@ ence with inten@@ tion and to design soun@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ es just like works of art .
"H@@ a@@ ve a fore@@ ground , a back@@ ground , all in beautiful pro@@ por@@ tion ."
It &apos;s fun to get into desig@@ ning with sound .
"If you can &apos;t do it yourself , get a prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal to do it for you ."
"S@@ ound design is the future , and I think it &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to change the way the world sounds ."
"I &apos;m going to just run quickly through eight mo@@ d@@ ali@@ ties , eight ways sound can impro@@ ve health ."
"F@@ ir@@ st , ul@@ tra@@ sound : we &apos;re very fami@@ li@@ ar with it from physi@@ cal ther@@ ap@@ y ; it &apos;s also now being used to tre@@ at can@@ cer ."
Li@@ th@@ ot@@ ri@@ p@@ sy — sa@@ ving thousands of people a year from the sc@@ al@@ pe@@ l by pul@@ ver@@ i@@ z@@ ing st@@ ones with high-@@ inten@@ sity sound .
S@@ ound heal@@ ing is a wonderful mo@@ d@@ ality .
It &apos;s been around for thousands of years .
I do ur@@ ge you to expl@@ ore this .
"There are great things being done there , tre@@ ating now au@@ ti@@ sm , de@@ men@@ ti@@ a and other con@@ di@@ tions ."
"And music , of course . J@@ ust list@@ ening to music is good for you , if it &apos;s music that &apos;s made with good inten@@ tion , made with love , gener@@ ally ."
"D@@ ev@@ oti@@ onal music , good — Mo@@ zar@@ t , good ."
There are all sor@@ ts of typ@@ es of music that are very health@@ y .
And four mo@@ d@@ ali@@ ties where you need to take some action and get inv@@ olved .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , list@@ en con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously ."
I hope that that after this talk you &apos;ll be doing that .
It &apos;s a whole new di@@ men@@ sion to your life and it &apos;s wonderful to have that di@@ men@@ sion .
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , get in tou@@ ch with making some sound — create sound ."
"The vo@@ ice is the instru@@ ment we all play , and yet how many of us are tra@@ ined in using our vo@@ ice ? G@@ et tra@@ ined ; learn to sing , learn to play an instru@@ ment ."
Musi@@ ci@@ ans have bi@@ g@@ ger bra@@ ins — it &apos;s true .
You can do this in grou@@ ps as well .
"It &apos;s a fanta@@ stic anti@@ dot@@ e to s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ hon@@ ia ; to make music and sound in a group of people , whi@@ ch@@ ever sty@@ le you en@@ jo@@ y parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly ."
And let &apos;s take a ste@@ war@@ ding ro@@ le for the sound around us .
"P@@ ro@@ te@@ ct your ear@@ s ? Yes , absolu@@ tely ."
De@@ sig@@ n soun@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ es to be beautiful around you at home and at work .
And let &apos;s start to speak up when people are as@@ sa@@ il@@ ing us with the no@@ ise that I pla@@ yed you early on .
So I &apos;m going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to impro@@ ve your health with sound .
"My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things , we will take a very big ste@@ p in that dire@@ ction ."
So I ur@@ ge you to take that pat@@ h .
"I &apos;m lea@@ ving you with a little more bir@@ d@@ s@@ ong , which is very good for you ."
I wi@@ sh you sound health .
( Applause )
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
"H@@ i , everybody ."
B@@ an@@ -@@ g@@ ap@@ -@@ se@@ um@@ -@@ ni@@ -@@ da .
I &apos;d like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life .
"I might look suc@@ cess@@ ful and happy being in front of you today , but I once su@@ f@@ fer@@ ed from se@@ v@@ ere de@@ pres@@ sion and was in tot@@ al des@@ pa@@ ir ."
"The vi@@ o@@ li@@ n , which me@@ ant everything to me , became a gra@@ ve bur@@ den on me ."
"A@@ l@@ though many people tr@@ ied to comfor@@ t and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge me , their words soun@@ ded like me@@ an@@ in@@ gl@@ ess no@@ ise ."
"When I was just about to give everything up after years of su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing , I started to re@@ disco@@ ver the true power of music ."
"( Music ) In the mi@@ d@@ st of har@@ d@@ ship , it was the music that gave me — that re@@ sto@@ red my s@@ ou@@ l ."
"The comfor@@ t the music gave me was just in@@ descri@@ b@@ able , and it was a real e@@ ye@@ -@@ open@@ ing experience for me too , and it tot@@ ally changed my perspe@@ ctive on life and set me f@@ ree from the pres@@ sure of be@@ coming a suc@@ cess@@ ful viol@@ ini@@ st ."
Do you feel like you are all alone ?
"I hope that this piece will tou@@ ch and he@@ al your heart , as it did for me ."
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
"Now , I use my music to re@@ ach people &apos;s hear@@ ts and have found there are no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies ."
"My audience is any@@ one who is here to list@@ en , even those who are not fami@@ li@@ ar with clas@@ si@@ cal music ."
"I not only play at the pre@@ sti@@ gi@@ ous clas@@ si@@ cal con@@ cer@@ t hal@@ ls like C@@ ar@@ neg@@ ie H@@ all and Ken@@ ne@@ dy C@@ enter , but also ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s , ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es , pri@@ s@@ ons , and re@@ stri@@ cted fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ies for le@@ pro@@ sy patients , just to men@@ tion a few ."
"Now , with my last piece , I &apos;d like to show you that clas@@ si@@ cal music can be so much fun , exci@@ ting , and that it can ro@@ ck you ."
"L@@ et me in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to my br@@ and new project , &quot; B@@ aro@@ qu@@ e in Ro@@ ck , &quot; which became a g@@ ol@@ den dis@@ c most re@@ cent@@ ly ."
It &apos;s such an hon@@ or for me .
"I think , while I &apos;m en@@ jo@@ ying my life as a happy musi@@ ci@@ an , I &apos;m ear@@ ning a lot more re@@ cogni@@ tion than I &apos;ve ever imag@@ ined ."
But it &apos;s now your turn .
Ch@@ ang@@ ing your perspe@@ cti@@ ves will not only trans@@ form you but also the whole world .
"J@@ ust play your life with all you have , and share it with the world ."
"I really look forward to wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing a trans@@ form@@ ing world by you , TE@@ D@@ st@@ ers ."
"P@@ l@@ ay your life , and st@@ ay tu@@ ned ."
( Music ) ( Applause )
"So I have bad news , I have good news , and I have a t@@ ask ."
So the bad news is that we all get si@@ ck .
I get si@@ ck . You get si@@ ck .
"And every one of us gets si@@ ck , and the question really is , how si@@ ck do we get ? Is it something that kil@@ ls us ?"
Is it something that we survi@@ ve ?
Is it something that we can tre@@ at ?
And we &apos;ve got@@ ten si@@ ck as long as we &apos;ve been people .
And so we &apos;ve always looked for reas@@ ons to expla@@ in why we get si@@ ck .
"And for a long time , it was the god@@ s , right ?"
"The god@@ s are ang@@ ry with me , or the god@@ s are test@@ ing me , right ? O@@ r God , sin@@ gu@@ lar , more re@@ cent@@ ly , is pu@@ ni@@ sh@@ ing me or ju@@ d@@ g@@ ing me ."
"And as long as we &apos;ve looked for ex@@ plan@@ ations , we &apos;ve w@@ ound up with something that gets clo@@ s@@ er and clo@@ s@@ er to science , which is hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es as to why we get si@@ ck , and as long as we &apos;ve had hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es about why we get si@@ ck , we &apos;ve tr@@ ied to tre@@ at it as well ."
"So this is A@@ vi@@ cen@@ na . He wro@@ te a book over a thous@@ and years ago called &quot; &quot; The C@@ an@@ on of Me@@ di@@ cine , &quot; &quot; and the ru@@ les he la@@ id out for test@@ ing medi@@ cin@@ es are actually really si@@ mi@@ lar to the ru@@ les we have today , that the dise@@ ase and the medi@@ cine must be the same str@@ eng@@ th , the medi@@ cine needs to be pu@@ re , and in the end we need to test it in people . And so if you put together these the@@ mes of a nar@@ r@@ ative or a hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis in human test@@ ing , right , you get some beautiful resul@@ ts , even when we didn &apos;t have very good technolog@@ ies ."
"This is a guy na@@ med C@@ ar@@ lo@@ s F@@ in@@ l@@ ay . He had a hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis that was way outside the box for his time , in the l@@ ate 1@@ 8@@ 0@@ 0s ."
He thought y@@ el@@ low fe@@ ver was not trans@@ mi@@ t@@ ted by di@@ r@@ ty clo@@ thing .
He thought it was trans@@ mi@@ t@@ ted by mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to@@ s .
"And they l@@ augh@@ ed at him . F@@ or 20 years , they called this guy &quot; &quot; the mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to man . &quot; &quot; But he ran an experim@@ ent in people , right ? He had this hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis , and he test@@ ed it in people ."
So he got vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers to go move to C@@ u@@ ba and live in t@@ ents and be vol@@ un@@ t@@ ari@@ ly in@@ fe@@ cted with y@@ el@@ low fe@@ ver .
So some of the people in some of the t@@ ents had di@@ r@@ ty clo@@ the@@ s and some of the people were in t@@ ents that were full of mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to@@ s that had been ex@@ posed to y@@ el@@ low fe@@ ver .
And it defini@@ ti@@ vely pro@@ ved that it wasn &apos;t this mag@@ ic d@@ ust called f@@ omi@@ tes in your clo@@ the@@ s that ca@@ used y@@ el@@ low fe@@ ver .
But it wasn &apos;t until we test@@ ed it in people that we actually knew .
And this is what those people sig@@ ned up for .
"This is what it looked like to have y@@ el@@ low fe@@ ver in C@@ u@@ ba at that time . You su@@ f@@ fer@@ ed in a t@@ ent , in the he@@ at , alone , and you probably d@@ ied ."
But people vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed for this .
And it &apos;s not just a cool example of a scienti@@ fic design of experim@@ ent in the@@ ory . They also did this beautiful thing .
"They sig@@ ned this do@@ cu@@ ment , and it &apos;s called an inform@@ ed con@@ s@@ ent do@@ cu@@ ment ."
"And inform@@ ed con@@ s@@ ent is an idea that we should be very pro@@ u@@ d of as a society , right ? It &apos;s something that se@@ par@@ ates us from the N@@ az@@ is at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g , en@@ for@@ ced medi@@ cal experim@@ ent@@ ation . It &apos;s the idea that ag@@ re@@ ement to jo@@ in a study without under@@ standing isn &apos;t ag@@ re@@ ement ."
"It &apos;s something that prote@@ cts us from har@@ m , from hu@@ ck@@ st@@ ers , from people that would try to ho@@ od@@ win@@ k us into a c@@ lini@@ cal study that we don &apos;t understand , or that we don &apos;t ag@@ ree to ."
"And so you put together the th@@ read of nar@@ r@@ ative hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis , experim@@ ent@@ ation in hum@@ ans , and inform@@ ed con@@ s@@ ent , and you get what we call c@@ lini@@ cal study , and it &apos;s how we do the v@@ ast maj@@ ori@@ ty of medi@@ cal work . It doesn &apos;t really matter if you &apos;re in the nor@@ th , the s@@ outh , the e@@ ast , the w@@ est ."
"C@@ lini@@ cal stud@@ ies form the basi@@ s of how we inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ate , so if we &apos;re going to look at a new dru@@ g , right , we test it in people , we dra@@ w blo@@ od , we do experim@@ ents , and we ga@@ in con@@ s@@ ent for that study , to make sure that we &apos;re not scre@@ w@@ ing people over as part of it ."
"But the world is chang@@ ing around the c@@ lini@@ cal study , which has been fa@@ ir@@ ly well est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed for ten@@ s of years if not 50 to 100 years ."
"So now we &apos;re able to ga@@ ther data about our gen@@ om@@ es , but , as we saw ear@@ lie@@ r , our gen@@ om@@ es ar@@ en &apos;t di@@ spos@@ i@@ tive ."
We &apos;re able to ga@@ ther information about our environment .
"And more import@@ an@@ tly , we &apos;re able to ga@@ ther information about our cho@@ i@@ ces , because it turns out that what we think of as our health is more like the inter@@ action of our bod@@ ies , our gen@@ om@@ es , our cho@@ i@@ ces and our environment ."
And the c@@ lini@@ cal meth@@ ods that we &apos;ve got ar@@ en &apos;t very good at stu@@ dy@@ ing that because they are based on the idea of per@@ son@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ person inter@@ action . You inter@@ act with your do@@ ctor and you get en@@ rol@@ led in the study .
"So this is my grand@@ father . I actually never met him , but he &apos;s hol@@ ding my mo@@ m , and his gen@@ es are in me , right ?"
"H@@ is cho@@ i@@ ces ran through to me . He was a smo@@ k@@ er , like most people were . This is my son ."
"So my grand@@ father &apos;s gen@@ es go all the way through to him , and my cho@@ i@@ ces are going to af@@ fe@@ ct his health ."
"The technology between these two pi@@ ctures cannot be more different , but the meth@@ od@@ o@@ logy for c@@ lini@@ cal stud@@ ies has not radi@@ cally changed over that time per@@ i@@ od ."
We just have better st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs .
"The way we ga@@ in inform@@ ed con@@ s@@ ent was form@@ ed in large part after World W@@ ar I@@ I , around the time that picture was taken ."
"That was 70 years ago , and the way we ga@@ in inform@@ ed con@@ s@@ ent , this to@@ ol that was created to prote@@ ct us from har@@ m , now cre@@ ates si@@ lo@@ s . So the data that we colle@@ ct for prost@@ ate can@@ cer or for Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s tri@@ als goes into si@@ lo@@ s where it can only be used for prost@@ ate can@@ cer or for Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s research ."
R@@ ight ? It can &apos;t be net@@ worked . It can &apos;t be inte@@ gr@@ ated .
It cannot be used by people who ar@@ en &apos;t cre@@ den@@ ti@@ al@@ ed .
So a physi@@ ci@@ st can &apos;t get ac@@ cess to it without fil@@ ing pa@@ per@@ work .
A computer scienti@@ st can &apos;t get ac@@ cess to it without fil@@ ing pa@@ per@@ work .
C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter scienti@@ sts ar@@ en &apos;t patien@@ t . They don &apos;t fi@@ le pa@@ per@@ work .
"And this is an ac@@ ci@@ dent . These are to@@ ols that we created to prote@@ ct us from har@@ m , but what they &apos;re doing is prote@@ cting us from in@@ no@@ vation now ."
And that wasn &apos;t the go@@ al . It wasn &apos;t the point . R@@ ight ?
"It &apos;s a side effe@@ ct , if you will , of a power we created to take us for good ."
"And so if you think about it , the de@@ pres@@ sing thing is that F@@ ace@@ book would never make a change to something as important as an ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m with a sam@@ ple size as small as a P@@ ha@@ se I@@ I@@ I c@@ lini@@ cal tri@@ al ."
We cannot take the information from past tri@@ als and put them together to form st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cally sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant sam@@ ples .
"And that su@@ cks , right ? So 4@@ 5 percent of men develo@@ p can@@ cer . Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ eight percent of women develo@@ p can@@ cer ."
One in four men d@@ ies of can@@ cer .
"One in five women d@@ ies of can@@ cer , at least in the United States ."
And three out of the four dru@@ gs we give you if you get can@@ cer fa@@ il . And this is per@@ s@@ onal to me .
My si@@ ster is a can@@ cer survi@@ v@@ or .
My mo@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w is a can@@ cer survi@@ v@@ or . C@@ an@@ cer su@@ cks .
"And when you have it , you don &apos;t have a lot of pri@@ vac@@ y in the ho@@ spit@@ al . You &apos;re na@@ ked the v@@ ast maj@@ ori@@ ty of the time ."
"P@@ e@@ ople you don &apos;t know come in and look at you and po@@ ke you and pro@@ d you , and when I tell can@@ cer survi@@ v@@ ors that this to@@ ol we created to prote@@ ct them is actually pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing their data from being used , es@@ pe@@ cially when only three to four percent of people who have can@@ cer ever even sig@@ n up for a c@@ lini@@ cal study , their re@@ action is not , &quot; &quot; Thank you , God , for prote@@ cting my pri@@ vac@@ y . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ou@@ tra@@ ge that we have this information and we can &apos;t use it ."
And it &apos;s an ac@@ ci@@ dent .
So the cost in blo@@ od and tre@@ as@@ ure of this is en@@ or@@ m@@ ous .
T@@ wo hundre@@ d and tw@@ en@@ ty@@ -@@ six billion a year is spent on can@@ cer in the United States .
F@@ i@@ f@@ te@@ en hundre@@ d people a day die in the United States .
And it &apos;s getting wor@@ se .
"So the good news is that some things have changed , and the most important thing that &apos;s changed is that we can now meas@@ ure ourselves in ways that used to be the dom@@ ini@@ on of the health system ."
So a lot of people talk about it as di@@ gi@@ tal ex@@ ha@@ ust .
I like to think of it as the d@@ ust that ru@@ ns along behind my kid .
"We can re@@ ach back and gra@@ b that d@@ ust , and we can learn a lot about health from it , so if our cho@@ i@@ ces are part of our health , what we e@@ at is a really important aspe@@ ct of our health . So you can do something very simple and basi@@ c and take a picture of your food , and if enough people do that , we can learn a lot about how our food af@@ fe@@ cts our health ."
"One interesting thing that came out of this — this is an ap@@ p for i@@ P@@ h@@ ones called The E@@ at@@ ery — is that we think our pi@@ z@@ za is sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ tly health@@ ier than other people &apos;s pi@@ z@@ za is . O@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) And it seem@@ s like a tri@@ vi@@ al resul@@ t , but this is the sort of research that used to take the health system years and hundre@@ ds of thousands of dollars to ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh ."
It was done in five months by a star@@ tu@@ p company of a couple of people .
I don &apos;t have any fin@@ an@@ cial inter@@ est in it .
"But more n@@ on@@ tri@@ vi@@ ally , we can get our gen@@ oty@@ p@@ es done , and al@@ though our gen@@ oty@@ p@@ es ar@@ en &apos;t di@@ spos@@ i@@ tive , they give us clu@@ es ."
"So I could show you m@@ ine . It &apos;s just A &apos;s , T &apos;s , C &apos;s and G &apos;s ."
"This is the inter@@ pret@@ ation of it . A@@ s you can see , I car@@ ry a 3@@ 2 percent ri@@ sk of prost@@ ate can@@ cer , 2@@ 2 percent ri@@ sk of p@@ sor@@ i@@ a@@ sis and a 14 percent ri@@ sk of Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s dise@@ ase ."
"So that means , if you &apos;re a gen@@ e@@ ti@@ ci@@ st , you &apos;re fre@@ aking out , going , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , you told everyone you car@@ ry the A@@ po@@ E E@@ 4 al@@ le@@ le . What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ? When I got these resul@@ ts , I started talking to do@@ ct@@ ors , and they told me not to tell any@@ one , and my re@@ action is , &quot; Is that going to help any@@ one cu@@ re me when I get the dise@@ ase ? &quot;"
And no one could tell me y@@ es .
"And I live in a we@@ b world where , when you share things , beautiful stuff happens , not bad stuff ."
"So I started pu@@ tting this in my sli@@ de de@@ cks , and I got even more ob@@ no@@ x@@ i@@ ous , and I went to my do@@ ctor , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to actually get my blo@@ od@@ work ."
P@@ le@@ ase give me back my data . &quot; &quot; So this is my most re@@ cent blo@@ od@@ work .
"As you can see , I have high cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol ."
"I have parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly high bad cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol , and I have some bad li@@ ver num@@ bers , but those are because we had a din@@ ner par@@ ty with a lot of good w@@ ine the night before we ran the test . ( Laughter ) R@@ ight . But look at how n@@ on-@@ compu@@ table this information is ."
"This is like the photogra@@ ph of my gran@@ dd@@ ad hol@@ ding my mo@@ m from a data perspe@@ ctive , and I had to go into the system and get it out ."
"So the thing that I &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing we do here is that we re@@ ach behind us and we gra@@ b the d@@ ust , that we re@@ ach into our bod@@ ies and we gra@@ b the gen@@ oty@@ pe , and we re@@ ach into the medi@@ cal system and we gra@@ b our recor@@ ds , and we use it to build something together , which is a comm@@ ons ."
"And there &apos;s been a lot of talk about com@@ mon@@ ses , right , here , there , every@@ where , right . A comm@@ ons is nothing more than a public good that we build out of pri@@ v@@ ate go@@ ods ."
"We do it vol@@ un@@ t@@ ari@@ ly , and we do it through stan@@ dar@@ di@@ zed leg@@ al to@@ ols . We do it through stan@@ dar@@ di@@ zed technolog@@ ies ."
R@@ ight . That &apos;s all a comm@@ ons is . It &apos;s something that we build together because we think it &apos;s important .
"And a comm@@ ons of data is something that &apos;s really uni@@ qu@@ e , because we make it from our own data . And al@@ though a lot of people like pri@@ vac@@ y as their meth@@ od@@ o@@ logy of control around data , and ob@@ s@@ ess around pri@@ vac@@ y , at least some of us really like to share as a form of control , and what &apos;s re@@ mark@@ able about di@@ gi@@ tal com@@ mon@@ ses is you don &apos;t need a big per@@ cent@@ age if your sam@@ ple size is big enough to gener@@ ate something mas@@ sive and beautiful ."
"So not that many progra@@ m@@ m@@ ers write f@@ ree so@@ f@@ tw@@ are , but we have the Ap@@ ac@@ he we@@ b ser@@ ver ."
"N@@ ot that many people who read Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a ed@@ it , but it works . So as long as some people like to share as their form of control , we can build a comm@@ ons , as long as we can get the information out ."
"And in bio@@ logy , the num@@ bers are even better ."
"So V@@ an@@ der@@ bi@@ l@@ t ran a study as@@ king people , we &apos;d like to take your bi@@ os@@ am@@ ples , your blo@@ od , and share them in a bi@@ ob@@ ank , and only five percent of the people op@@ ted out ."
I &apos;m from T@@ en@@ n@@ es@@ see . It &apos;s not the most scien@@ ce@@ -@@ posi@@ tive state in the United States of America . ( Laughter ) But only five percent of the people wanted out .
"So people like to share , if you give them the opportunity and the cho@@ ice ."
"And the reason that I got ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with this , be@@ si@@ des the obvi@@ ous family aspe@@ cts , is that I spend a lot of time around ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ ans , and ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ ans are d@@ raw@@ n to places where there &apos;s a lot of data because they can use it to te@@ ase sig@@ n@@ als out of no@@ ise ."
"And those cor@@ rel@@ ations that they can te@@ ase out , they &apos;re not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly ca@@ us@@ al ag@@ ents , but mat@@ h , in this day and age , is like a gi@@ ant set of power to@@ ols that we &apos;re lea@@ ving on the flo@@ or , not p@@ lu@@ gg@@ ed in in health , while we use hand sa@@ ws ."
"If we have a lot of sh@@ ared gen@@ oty@@ p@@ es , and a lot of sh@@ ared out@@ comes , and a lot of sh@@ ared li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le cho@@ i@@ ces , and a lot of sh@@ ared environ@@ ment@@ al information , we can start to te@@ ase out the cor@@ rel@@ ations between sub@@ tle v@@ ari@@ ations in people , the cho@@ i@@ ces they make and the health that they create as a resul@@ t of those cho@@ i@@ ces , and there &apos;s open@@ -@@ source in@@ fra@@ structure to do all of this ."
"S@@ age Bi@@ on@@ et@@ works is a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it that &apos;s built a gi@@ ant mat@@ h system that &apos;s wai@@ ting for data , but there isn &apos;t any ."
"So that &apos;s what I do . I &apos;ve actually started what we think is the world &apos;s first fully di@@ gi@@ tal , fully self-@@ con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted , un@@ li@@ mi@@ ted in sc@@ op@@ e , global in parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation , e@@ thi@@ cally appro@@ ved c@@ lini@@ cal research study where you con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te the data ."
"So if you re@@ ach behind yourself and you gra@@ b the d@@ ust , if you re@@ ach into your body and gra@@ b your gen@@ ome , if you re@@ ach into the medi@@ cal system and some@@ how ex@@ trac@@ t your medi@@ cal recor@@ d , you can actually go through an on@@ line inform@@ ed con@@ s@@ ent process — because the d@@ on@@ ation to the comm@@ ons must be vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary and it must be inform@@ ed — and you can actually up@@ lo@@ ad your information and have it syn@@ di@@ c@@ ated to the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ ans who will do this sort of big data research , and the go@@ al is to get 10@@ 0,000 in the first year and a million in the first five years so that we ha@@ ve@@ "
"@@ a st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cally sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant co@@ hor@@ t that you can use to take s@@ mal@@ ler sam@@ ple si@@ z@@ es from tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal research and ma@@ p it against , so that you can use it to te@@ ase out those sub@@ tle cor@@ rel@@ ations between the v@@ ari@@ ations that make us uni@@ qu@@ e and the kinds of health that we need to move forward as a society ."
And I &apos;ve spent a lot of time around other comm@@ ons .
"I &apos;ve been around the early we@@ b . I &apos;ve been around the early cre@@ ative comm@@ ons world , and there &apos;s four things that all of these share , which is , they &apos;re all really simple ."
"And so if you were to go to the we@@ b@@ site and en@@ ro@@ ll in this study , you &apos;re not going to see something comp@@ lic@@ ated ."
"But it &apos;s not sim@@ pli@@ stic . These things are we@@ ak inten@@ tion@@ ally , right , because you can always ad@@ d power and control to a system , but it &apos;s very difficult to re@@ move those things if you put them in at the beginning , and so being simple doesn &apos;t mean being sim@@ pli@@ stic , and being we@@ ak doesn &apos;t mean we@@ ak@@ ness ."
Th@@ ose are str@@ eng@@ ths in the system .
And open doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s no money .
"C@@ lo@@ sed systems , cor@@ por@@ ations , make a lot of money on the open we@@ b , and they &apos;re one of the reas@@ ons why the open we@@ b lives is that cor@@ por@@ ations have a v@@ est@@ ed inter@@ est in the open@@ ness of the system ."
"And so all of these things are part of the c@@ lini@@ cal study that we &apos;ve created , so you can actually come in , all you have to be is 14 years old , wil@@ ling to sig@@ n a con@@ trac@@ t that says I &apos;m not going to be a j@@ er@@ k , basically , and you &apos;re in ."
You can start an@@ al@@ yz@@ ing the data .
"You do have to sol@@ ve a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A as well . ( Laughter ) And if you &apos;d like to build cor@@ por@@ ate stru@@ ctures on top of it , that &apos;s o@@ kay too . That &apos;s all in the con@@ s@@ ent , so if you don &apos;t like those terms , you don &apos;t come in ."
It &apos;s very much the design prin@@ ci@@ ples of a comm@@ ons that we &apos;re trying to bring to health data .
"And the other thing about these systems is that it only takes a small number of really un@@ reas@@ on@@ able people working together to create them . It didn &apos;t take that many people to make Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a , or to keep it Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a ."
"And we &apos;re not sup@@ posed to be un@@ reas@@ on@@ able in health , and so I h@@ ate this word &quot; &quot; patien@@ t . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like being patien@@ t when systems are bro@@ k@@ en , and health care is bro@@ k@@ en ."
"I &apos;m not talking about the poli@@ ti@@ cs of health care , I &apos;m talking about the way we scienti@@ fi@@ cally appro@@ ach health care ."
"So I don &apos;t want to be patien@@ t . And the t@@ ask I &apos;m gi@@ ving to you is to not be patien@@ t . So I &apos;d like you to actually try , when you go home , to get your data ."
"You &apos;ll be sh@@ oc@@ ked and of@@ f@@ en@@ ded and , I would be@@ t , ou@@ tra@@ g@@ ed , at how hard it is to get it ."
"But it &apos;s a challen@@ ge that I hope you &apos;ll take , and maybe you &apos;ll share it . Ma@@ ybe you won &apos;t ."
"If you don &apos;t have any@@ one in your family who &apos;s si@@ ck , maybe you wouldn &apos;t be un@@ reas@@ on@@ able . But if you do , or if you &apos;ve been si@@ ck , then maybe you would ."
And we &apos;re going to be able to do an experim@@ ent in the next se@@ ver@@ al months that le@@ ts us know exactly how many un@@ reas@@ on@@ able people are out there .
"So this is the A@@ th@@ en@@ a B@@ re@@ ast H@@ e@@ alth N@@ et@@ work . It &apos;s a study of 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 women in C@@ alifor@@ nia , and they &apos;re going to re@@ turn all the data to the parti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts of the study in a compu@@ table form , with one@@ -@@ cli@@ ck@@ ability to lo@@ ad it into the study that I &apos;ve put together . So we &apos;ll know exactly how many people are wil@@ ling to be un@@ reas@@ on@@ able ."
"So what I &apos;d end &#91; with &#93; is , the most beautiful thing I &apos;ve learned since I qu@@ it my job almost a year ago to do this , is that it really doesn &apos;t take very many of us to ach@@ ie@@ ve spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar resul@@ ts ."
"You just have to be wil@@ ling to be un@@ reas@@ on@@ able , and the ri@@ sk we &apos;re ru@@ n@@ ning is not the ri@@ sk those 14 men who got y@@ el@@ low fe@@ ver ran . R@@ ight ?"
"It &apos;s to be na@@ ked , di@@ gi@@ t@@ ally , in public . So you know more about me and my health than I know about you . It &apos;s as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c now ."
And being na@@ ked and alone can be terri@@ f@@ ying .
"But to be na@@ ked in a group , vol@@ un@@ t@@ ari@@ ly , can be quite beautiful ."
And so it doesn &apos;t take all of us .
It just takes all of some of us . Thank you .
( Applause )
Ma@@ ybe we &apos;re not the right people to do it .
"And so through this pi@@ ano ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard , we have the means to take a musi@@ cal process and study it ."
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) C@@ L : Mi@@ ke , come on in ."
I &apos;ve always been fas@@ cin@@ ated by fre@@ est@@ y@@ le .
"O@@ ver the past six months , I &apos;ve spent my time tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing . I think I &apos;ve done 6@@ 0,000 miles , but without lea@@ ving my des@@ k ."
And the reason I can do that is because I &apos;m actually two people .
"I look like one person but I &apos;m two people . I &apos;m E@@ dd@@ ie who is here , and at the same time , my al@@ ter ego is a big green bo@@ x@@ y av@@ at@@ ar ni@@ ck@@ na@@ med C@@ y@@ ber Fran@@ k ."
"So that &apos;s what I spend my time doing . I &apos;d like to start , if it &apos;s possible , with a test , because I do business stuff , so it &apos;s important that we fo@@ cus on out@@ comes ."
"And then I stru@@ gg@@ led , because I was thinking to myself , &quot; &quot; What should I talk ? What should I do ? It &apos;s a TED audience ."
It &apos;s got to be stre@@ t@@ ching . How am I going to make — ? &quot; &quot; So I just hope I &apos;ve got the level of difficul@@ ty right .
So let &apos;s just walk our way through this .
P@@ le@@ ase could you work this through with me ? You can sh@@ out out the answer if you like .
"The question is , which of these h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tal lin@@ es is longer ?"
The answer is ?
A@@ ud@@ ience : The sam@@ e@@ .@@ E@@ dd@@ ie O@@ b@@ en@@ g : The same .
"No , they &apos;re not the same . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re not the same . The top one is 10 percent longer than the bot@@ tom one ."
"So why did you tell me they were the same ? Do you remember when we were kids at school , about that big , they pla@@ yed the same tri@@ ck on us ?"
It was to te@@ ach us par@@ al@@ la@@ x . Do you remember ?
"And you got , you said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the same ! &quot; &quot; And you got it wrong ."
"You remember ? And you learned the answer , and you &apos;ve car@@ ried this answer in your head for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years : The answer is the same . The answer is the same . So when you &apos;re asked what the len@@ g@@ ths are , you say they &apos;re the same , but they &apos;re not the same , because I &apos;ve changed it ."
And this is what I &apos;m trying to expla@@ in has happened to us in the 2@@ 1@@ st century .
S@@ ome@@ body or something has changed the ru@@ les about how our world works .
"When I &apos;m jo@@ king , I try and expla@@ in it happened at mi@@ dni@@ ght , you see , while we were as@@ le@@ ep , but it was mi@@ dni@@ ght 15 years ago . O@@ kay ?"
"You didn &apos;t noti@@ ce it ? But basically , what they do is , they s@@ wit@@ ched all the ru@@ les round , so that the way to suc@@ cess@@ fully run a business , an organiz@@ ation , or even a country , has been de@@ le@@ ted , fli@@ pped , and it &apos;s a completely new — you think I &apos;m jo@@ king , don &apos;t you — there &apos;s a completely new set of ru@@ les in oper@@ ation . ( Laughter ) D@@ id you noti@@ ce that ? I mean , you mis@@ sed this one ."
"You probably — No , you didn &apos;t . O@@ kay . ( Laughter ) My simple idea is that what &apos;s happened is , the real 2@@ 1@@ st century around us isn &apos;t so obvi@@ ous to us , so instead we spend our time respon@@ ding r@@ ati@@ on@@ ally to a world which we understand and re@@ cogni@@ ze , but which no longer ex@@ ist@@ s ."
"You don &apos;t believe me , do you ? O@@ kay . ( Applause ) So let me take you on a little jour@@ ney of many of the things I don &apos;t understand ."
"If you sear@@ ch A@@ ma@@ z@@ on for the word &quot; &quot; cre@@ ati@@ vity , &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll disco@@ ver something like 9@@ 0,000 boo@@ ks ."
"If you go on Go@@ og@@ le and you look for &quot; &quot; in@@ no@@ vation + cre@@ ati@@ vity , &quot; &quot; you get 30 million hi@@ ts . If you ad@@ d the word &quot; &quot; con@@ sul@@ tan@@ ts , &quot; &quot; it d@@ ou@@ b@@ les to 60 million . ( Laughter ) A@@ re you with me ? And yet , st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cally , what you disco@@ ver is that about one in 10@@ 0,000 ideas is found making money or deli@@ ver@@ ing b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts two years after its in@@ cep@@ tion ."
It makes no sense . C@@ om@@ pan@@ ies make their ex@@ pen@@ sive ex@@ e@@ cu@@ ti@@ ves spend ages car@@ e@@ fully pre@@ par@@ ing fore@@ ca@@ sts and bud@@ gets which are ob@@ so@@ le@@ te or need chang@@ ing before they can be publi@@ shed .
"H@@ ow is that possible ? If you look at the vi@@ sions we have , the vi@@ sions of how we &apos;re going to change the world , the key thing is im@@ ple@@ ment@@ ation . We have the vision ."
We &apos;ve got to make it happen .
We &apos;ve spent de@@ ca@@ des prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ aliz@@ ing im@@ ple@@ ment@@ ation .
Pe@@ ople are sup@@ posed to be good at making stuff happen .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , if I use as an example a family of five going on ho@@ li@@ day , if you can imagine this , all the way from Lon@@ don all the way across to H@@ ong K@@ ong , what I want you to think about is their bud@@ get is only 3@@ ,000 po@@ un@@ ds of ex@@ pen@@ ses ."
"What actually happens is , if I comp@@ are this to the a@@ ver@@ age real project , a@@ ver@@ age real suc@@ cess@@ ful project , the family actually end up in M@@ ak@@ as@@ sa@@ r , S@@ outh S@@ ul@@ aw@@ es@@ i , at a cost of 4@@ ,000 po@@ un@@ ds , wh@@ il@@ st lea@@ ving two of the children behind . ( Laughter ) What I &apos;m trying to expla@@ in to you is , there are things which don &apos;t make sense to us ."
It gets even wor@@ se than that . Let me just walk you through this one .
"This is a quot@@ e , and I &apos;ll just pi@@ ck words out of it ."
"It says — I &apos;ll put on the vo@@ ice — &quot; &quot; In sum@@ mar@@ y , your Ma@@ je@@ sty , the fai@@ lu@@ re to fore@@ see the ti@@ ming , ex@@ t@@ ent and se@@ ver@@ ity of the cri@@ sis was du@@ e to the l@@ ack of cre@@ ati@@ vity and the number of b@@ right min@@ ds , &quot; &quot; or something like that ."
"This was a group of em@@ in@@ ent econom@@ ist@@ s apo@@ logi@@ z@@ ing to the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of En@@ gl@@ and when she asked the question , &quot; &quot; Why did no one tell us that the cri@@ sis was coming ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll never get my k@@ ni@@ gh@@ th@@ o@@ od . I &apos;ll never get my k@@ ni@@ gh@@ th@@ o@@ od . ( Laughter ) That &apos;s not the important point . The thing you have to remember is , these are em@@ in@@ ent econom@@ ist@@ s , some of the s@@ mar@@ test people on the planet . Do you see the challen@@ ge ? ( Laughter ) It &apos;s sc@@ ary . My friend and ment@@ or , T@@ im B@@ row@@ n of ID@@ E@@ O , he expla@@ ins that design must get big , and he &apos;s right ."
He wi@@ se@@ ly expla@@ ins this to us . He says design thinking must t@@ ac@@ k@@ le big systems for the challen@@ ges we have .
He &apos;s absolu@@ tely right .
"And then I ask myself , &quot; &quot; Why was it ever small ? &quot; &quot; I@@ sn &apos;t it we@@ ird ? You know , if col@@ labor@@ ation is so cool , is cro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ fun@@ cti@@ onal working is so amazing , why did we build these huge h@@ ier@@ ar@@ ch@@ ies ? What &apos;s going on ?"
"You see , I think what &apos;s happened , per@@ haps , is that we &apos;ve not noti@@ ced that change I descri@@ bed ear@@ lie@@ r ."
What we do know is that the world has ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated .
C@@ y@@ ber@@ space mo@@ ves everything at the speed of light .
T@@ ech@@ no@@ logy ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ates things ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally .
"So if this is now , and that &apos;s the past , and we start thinking about change , you know , all govern@@ ments are see@@ king change , you &apos;re here see@@ king change , everybody &apos;s after change , it &apos;s really cool . ( Laughter ) So what happens is , we get this wonderful wh@@ o@@ o@@ sh@@ ing ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ation and change ."
The speed is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating . That &apos;s not the only thing .
"A@@ t the same time , as we &apos;ve done that , we &apos;ve done something really we@@ ird ."
"We &apos;ve d@@ ou@@ b@@ led the popul@@ ation in 40 years , put half of them in cities , then conne@@ cted them all up so they can inter@@ act ."
The den@@ sity of the inter@@ action of human be@@ ings is amazing .
There are char@@ ts which show all these mov@@ em@@ ents of information . That den@@ sity of information is amazing .
And then we &apos;ve done a third thing .
"@@ you know , for those of you who have as an offi@@ ce a little des@@ k under@@ ne@@ ath the sta@@ ir@@ s , and you say , well this is my little des@@ k under the sta@@ ir@@ s , no ! You are sitting at the he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of a global cor@@ por@@ ation if you &apos;re conne@@ cted to the Inter@@ net ."
"What &apos;s happened is , we &apos;ve changed the scale ."
S@@ i@@ ze and scale are no longer the same .
"And then ad@@ d to that , every time you t@@ we@@ et , over a third of your fol@@ low@@ ers fol@@ low from a country which is not your own ."
G@@ lob@@ al is the new scale . We know that .
"And so people say things like , &quot; &quot; The world is now a tur@@ bu@@ l@@ ent place . &quot; &quot; Ha@@ ve you heard them saying things like that ?"
And they use it as a me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or . Ha@@ ve you come across this ?
"And they think it &apos;s a me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or , but this is not a me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or ."
"It &apos;s re@@ ality . A@@ s a young engine@@ ering stud@@ ent , I remember going to a de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation where they basically , the de@@ mon@@ str@@ ator did something quite in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing ."
"What he did was , he got a tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent pi@@ pe — have you seen this de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation before ? — he att@@ ach@@ ed it to a ta@@ p . So effe@@ cti@@ vely what you had was , you had a situ@@ ation where — I &apos;ll try and dra@@ w the ta@@ p and the pi@@ pe , actually I &apos;ll sk@@ i@@ p the ta@@ p . The ta@@ ps are hard ."
"O@@ kay ? So I &apos;ll write the word &quot; &quot; ta@@ p . &quot; &quot; Is that o@@ kay ? It &apos;s a ta@@ p . ( Laughter ) O@@ kay , so he att@@ ach@@ es it to a tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent pi@@ pe , and he turns the water on ."
"And he says , do you noti@@ ce anything ? And the water is wh@@ o@@ o@@ sh@@ ing down this pi@@ pe ."
"I mean , this is not exci@@ ting stuff . A@@ re you with me ?"
So the water goes up . He turns it back down . Gre@@ at .
"And he says , &quot; &quot; An@@ y@@ thing you noti@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; No . Th@@ en he sti@@ cks a need@@ le into the pi@@ pe , and he conne@@ cts this to a con@@ tain@@ er , and he fil@@ ls the con@@ tain@@ er up with green in@@ k . You with me ?"
So gu@@ ess what happens ? A th@@ in green line comes out as it f@@ low@@ s down the pi@@ pe . It &apos;s not that interesting .
"And then he turns the water up a bit , so it star@@ ts coming back in . And nothing chang@@ es ."
"So he &apos;s chang@@ ing the f@@ low of the water , but it &apos;s just a bor@@ ing green line ."
He ad@@ ds some more . He ad@@ ds some more . And then something we@@ ird happens .
"There &apos;s this little fli@@ ck@@ er , and then as he turns it ever so sli@@ gh@@ tly more , the whole of that green line disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars , and instead there are these little sort of in@@ k@@ y d@@ ust de@@ vi@@ ls close to the need@@ le ."
"They &apos;re called ed@@ d@@ ies . N@@ ot me . And they &apos;re viol@@ ently disp@@ er@@ sing the in@@ k so that it actually gets di@@ lu@@ ted out , and the color &apos;s gone ."
What &apos;s happened in this world of pi@@ pe is somebody has fli@@ pped it . They &apos;ve changed the ru@@ les from l@@ am@@ in@@ ar to tur@@ bu@@ l@@ ent .
"A@@ ll the ru@@ les are gone . In that environment , in@@ stan@@ tly , all the possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies which tur@@ bu@@ l@@ ence br@@ ings are available , and it &apos;s not the same as l@@ am@@ in@@ ar ."
"And if we didn &apos;t have that green in@@ k , you &apos;d never noti@@ ce ."
"And I think this is our challen@@ ge , because somebody has actually incre@@ as@@ ed — and it &apos;s probably you guys with all your te@@ ch and stuff — the speed , the scale and the den@@ sity of inter@@ action ."
Now how do we cop@@ e and deal with that ?
"Well , we could just call it tur@@ bu@@ l@@ ence , or we could try and learn ."
"@@ Yes , learn , but I know you guys gre@@ w up in the days when there were actually these things called cor@@ re@@ ct ans@@ w@@ ers , because of the answer you gave me to the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tal line pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and you believe it will last fore@@ ver ."
"So I &apos;ll put a little line up here which re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts lear@@ ning , and that &apos;s how we used to do it . We could see things , understand them , take the time to put them into prac@@ ti@@ ce ."
"O@@ u@@ t here is the world . Now , what &apos;s happened to our p@@ ace of lear@@ ning as the world has ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated ? Well , if you work for a cor@@ por@@ ation , you &apos;ll disco@@ ver it &apos;s quite difficult to work on stuff which your b@@ os@@ s doesn &apos;t appro@@ ve of , isn &apos;t in the strate@@ gy , and any@@ way , you &apos;ve got to go through your mon@@ th@@ ly me@@ et@@ ings ."
"If you work in an institu@@ tion , one day you will get them to make that deci@@ sion ."
"And if you work in a market where people believe in cy@@ cles , it &apos;s even fun@@ nie@@ r , because you have to wa@@ it all the way for the cy@@ cle to fa@@ il before you go , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s something wrong . &quot; &quot; You with me ?"
"So it &apos;s li@@ ke@@ ly that the line , in terms of lear@@ ning , is pretty f@@ lat ."
"You with me ? This point over here , the point at which the lin@@ es c@@ ross over , the p@@ ace of change over@@ takes the p@@ ace of lear@@ ning , and for me , that is what I was descri@@ b@@ ing when I was tel@@ ling you about mi@@ dni@@ ght ."
"So what does it do to us ? Well , it completely trans@@ form@@ s what we have to do , many mist@@ ak@@ es we make . We sol@@ ve last year &apos;s problems without thinking about the future . If you try and think about it , the things you &apos;re sol@@ ving now , what problems are they going to bring in the future ?"
"If you ha@@ ven &apos;t under@@ sto@@ od the world you &apos;re living in , it &apos;s almost im@@ possible to be absolu@@ tely certain that what you &apos;re going to deli@@ ver fi@@ ts ."
"I &apos;ll give you an example , a qui@@ ck one . C@@ re@@ ati@@ vity and ideas , I men@@ tion@@ ed that ear@@ lie@@ r . All the C@@ E@@ O@@ s around me , my cl@@ ien@@ ts , they want in@@ no@@ vation , so they se@@ ek in@@ no@@ vation . They say to people , &quot; &quot; T@@ ake ri@@ sk@@ s and be cre@@ ative ! &quot; &quot; But un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely the words get trans@@ form@@ ed as they tra@@ vel through the air ."
"E@@ n@@ ter@@ ing their ear@@ s , what they hear is , &quot; &quot; Do c@@ razy things and then I &apos;ll fi@@ re you . &quot; &quot; Why ? ( Laughter ) Because — Why ? Because in the old world , o@@ kay , in the old world , over here , getting stuff wrong was un@@ ac@@ cep@@ table ."
"If you got something wrong , you &apos;d fai@@ led . How should you be tre@@ ated ?"
"Well , har@@ sh@@ ly , because you could have asked somebody who had experience ."
"So we learned the answer and we car@@ ried this in our he@@ ads for 20 , 30 years , are you with me ?"
"The answer is , don &apos;t do things which are different ."
And then sud@@ den@@ ly we tell them to and it doesn &apos;t work .
"You see , in re@@ ality , there are two ways you can fa@@ il in our new world ."
"One , you &apos;re doing something that you should fol@@ low a pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re to , and it &apos;s a very difficult thing , you &apos;re s@@ lo@@ pp@@ y , you get it wrong . How should you be tre@@ ated ? You should probably be fi@@ red ."
"O@@ n the other hand , you &apos;re doing something new , no one &apos;s ever done before , you get it completely wrong . How should you be tre@@ ated ?"
"Well , f@@ ree pi@@ z@@ z@@ as ! You should be tre@@ ated better than the people who suc@@ ce@@ ed ."
It &apos;s called s@@ mar@@ t fai@@ lu@@ re . Why ? Because you can &apos;t put it on your C@@ .@@ V@@ .
"So what I want to leave you , then , is with the ex@@ plan@@ ation of why I actually tra@@ ve@@ led 6@@ 0,000 miles from my des@@ k ."
"When I realized the power of this new world , I qu@@ it my sa@@ fe teach@@ ing job , and set up a vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al business school , the first in the world , in order to te@@ ach people how to make this happen , and I used some of my lear@@ n@@ ings about some of the ru@@ les which I &apos;d learned on myself ."
"If you &apos;re interested , wor@@ l@@ d@@ af@@ ter@@ mi@@ dni@@ gh@@ t@@ .@@ co@@ m , you &apos;ll find out more , but I &apos;ve ap@@ pl@@ ied them to myself for over a dec@@ ade , and I &apos;m still here , and I still have my house , and the most important thing is , I hope I &apos;ve done enough to in@@ je@@ ct a little green in@@ k into your lives , so that when you go away and you &apos;re making your next absolu@@ tely sen@@ si@@ ble and r@@ ational deci@@ sion , you &apos;ll take some time to think , &quot; &quot; H@@ m@@ m , I won@@ der whether this also makes sense in our new world after mi@@ dni@@ ght . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much ."
"( Applause ) Thank you , th@@ ank you . ( Applause )"
We always hear that te@@ x@@ ting is a sc@@ our@@ ge .
"The idea is that te@@ x@@ ting spe@@ l@@ ls the dec@@ line and f@@ all of any kind of seri@@ ous liter@@ acy , or at least writing ability , am@@ ong young people in the United States and now the whole world today ."
"The fact of the matter is that it just isn &apos;t true , and it &apos;s e@@ asy to think that it is true , but in order to see it in another way , in order to see that actually te@@ x@@ ting is a mi@@ rac@@ ul@@ ous thing , not just ener@@ ge@@ tic , but a mi@@ rac@@ ul@@ ous thing , a kind of em@@ er@@ g@@ ent comple@@ x@@ ity that we &apos;re seeing happening right now , we have to pu@@ ll the cam@@ era back for a bit and look at what language really is , in which case , one thing that we see is that te@@ x@@ ting is not writing at all ."
What do I mean by that ?
"B@@ a@@ si@@ cally , if we think about language , language has ex@@ ist@@ ed for per@@ haps 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 years , at least 8@@ 0,000 years , and what it aro@@ se as is spe@@ e@@ ch . Pe@@ ople tal@@ ked ."
That &apos;s what we &apos;re probably gen@@ e@@ ti@@ cally speci@@ f@@ ied for .
That &apos;s how we use language most .
"W@@ ri@@ ting is something that came along much later , and as we saw in the last talk , there &apos;s a little bit of contro@@ vers@@ y as to exactly when that happened , but ac@@ cor@@ ding to tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal est@@ im@@ ates , if hum@@ ani@@ ty had ex@@ ist@@ ed for 2@@ 4 hours , then writing only came along at about 11 : 0@@ 7 p@@ .@@ m@@ ."
That &apos;s how much of a lat@@ ter@@ ly thing writing is .
"So first there &apos;s spe@@ e@@ ch , and then writing comes along as a kind of arti@@ fi@@ ce ."
"Now don &apos;t get me wrong , writing has certain adv@@ an@@ t@@ ages ."
"When you write , because it &apos;s a con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous process , because you can look back@@ war@@ ds , you can do things with language that are much less li@@ ke@@ ly if you &apos;re just talking ."
"For example , imagine a pas@@ s@@ age from E@@ d@@ ward G@@ i@@ b@@ b@@ on &apos;s &quot; The De@@ c@@ line and F@@ all of the R@@ om@@ an E@@ m@@ pi@@ re : &quot; &quot; &quot; The whole eng@@ ag@@ ement la@@ st@@ ed ab@@ o@@ ve tw@@ el@@ ve hours , ti@@ ll the gra@@ du@@ ate re@@ tre@@ at of the P@@ er@@ si@@ ans was changed into a di@@ sor@@ der@@ ly f@@ light , of which the sha@@ me@@ ful example was given by the prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al le@@ ad@@ ers and the S@@ ur@@ en@@ as hi@@ m@@ self . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s beautiful , but let &apos;s face it , no@@ body tal@@ ks that way ."
"O@@ r at least , they sh@@ ouldn &apos;t if they &apos;re interested in re@@ produ@@ cing . That — ( Laughter ) is not the way any human being spe@@ ak@@ s c@@ as@@ u@@ ally ."
C@@ as@@ u@@ al spe@@ e@@ ch is something quite different .
"L@@ in@@ gu@@ ist@@ s have actually sh@@ own that when we &apos;re spe@@ aking c@@ as@@ u@@ ally in an un@@ mon@@ i@@ to@@ red way , we ten@@ d to speak in word pac@@ ke@@ ts of maybe seven to 10 words ."
You &apos;ll noti@@ ce this if you ever have oc@@ ca@@ sion to recor@@ d yourself or a group of people talking .
That &apos;s what spe@@ e@@ ch is like .
S@@ pe@@ e@@ ch is much lo@@ os@@ er . It &apos;s much more tele@@ gra@@ phi@@ c .
It &apos;s much less ref@@ le@@ ctive — very different from writing .
"So we natur@@ ally ten@@ d to think , because we see language wri@@ t@@ ten so often , that that &apos;s what language is , but actually what language is , is spe@@ e@@ ch . They are two things ."
"Now of course , as history has gone by , it &apos;s been natural for there to be a certain amount of b@@ le@@ ed between spe@@ e@@ ch and writing ."
"So , for example , in a di@@ st@@ ant era now , it was common when one gave a spe@@ e@@ ch to basically talk like writing ."
"So I mean the kind of spe@@ e@@ ch that you see someone gi@@ ving in an old movie where they clear their th@@ ro@@ at , and they go , &quot; &quot; A@@ h@@ em , l@@ ad@@ ies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , &quot; &quot; and then they speak in a certain way which has nothing to do with c@@ as@@ u@@ al spe@@ e@@ ch ."
It &apos;s form@@ al . It uses long s@@ ent@@ ences like this G@@ i@@ b@@ b@@ on one .
"It &apos;s basically talking like you write , and so , for example , we &apos;re thinking so much these days about L@@ in@@ col@@ n because of the movie ."
The G@@ et@@ ty@@ s@@ bur@@ g A@@ d@@ dre@@ ss was not the ma@@ in me@@ al of that ev@@ ent .
"For two hours before that , E@@ d@@ ward E@@ ver@@ et@@ t spo@@ ke on a top@@ ic that , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , cannot eng@@ age us today and bar@@ ely did then ."
The point of it was to list@@ en to him spe@@ aking like writing .
O@@ r@@ din@@ ary people sto@@ od and list@@ en@@ ed to that for two hours .
It was perfe@@ ct@@ ly natural .
"That &apos;s what people did then , spe@@ aking like writing ."
"Well , if you can speak like writing , then logi@@ cally it fol@@ low@@ s that you might want to also sometimes write like you speak ."
"The problem was just that in the materi@@ al , mechani@@ cal sense , that was har@@ der back in the day for the simple reason that materi@@ als don &apos;t l@@ end themselves to it ."
"It &apos;s almost im@@ possible to do that with your hand ex@@ cept in shor@@ th@@ and , and then communi@@ cation is li@@ mi@@ ted ."
"O@@ n a man@@ u@@ al ty@@ pew@@ ri@@ ter it was very difficult , and even when we had electri@@ c ty@@ pew@@ ri@@ ters , or then computer ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , the fact is that even if you can ty@@ pe e@@ a@@ si@@ ly enough to keep up with the p@@ ace of spe@@ e@@ ch , more or less , you have to have somebody who can re@@ cei@@ ve your mess@@ age quickly ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you have things in your po@@ ck@@ et that can re@@ cei@@ ve that mess@@ age , then you have the con@@ di@@ tions that al@@ low that we can write like we speak ."
And that &apos;s where te@@ x@@ ting comes in .
"And so , te@@ x@@ ting is very lo@@ ose in its structure ."
"No one thin@@ ks about ca@@ pi@@ tal let@@ ters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation when one te@@ x@@ ts , but then again , do you think about those things when you talk ?"
"No , and so ther@@ e@@ fore why would you when you were te@@ x@@ ting ?"
"What te@@ x@@ ting is , des@@ pi@@ te the fact that it inv@@ ol@@ ves the bru@@ te mechani@@ cs of something that we call writing , is fin@@ ger@@ ed spe@@ e@@ ch . That &apos;s what te@@ x@@ ting is ."
Now we can write the way we talk .
"And it &apos;s a very interesting thing , but ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less e@@ asy to think that still it re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts some sort of dec@@ line ."
"We see this gener@@ al b@@ ag@@ gin@@ ess of the structure , the l@@ ack of con@@ cer@@ n with ru@@ les and the way that we &apos;re used to lear@@ ning on the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ bo@@ ard , and so we think that something has gone wrong ."
It &apos;s a very natural sense .
But the fact of the matter is that what is going on is a kind of em@@ er@@ g@@ ent comple@@ x@@ ity .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing in this fin@@ ger@@ ed spe@@ e@@ ch .
"And in order to understand it , what we want to see is the way , in this new kind of language , there is new structure coming up ."
"And so , for example , there is in te@@ x@@ ting a con@@ ven@@ tion , which is L@@ O@@ L ."
"Now L@@ O@@ L , we gener@@ ally think of as me@@ an@@ ing &quot; &quot; l@@ augh@@ ing out l@@ ou@@ d . &quot; &quot; And of course , the@@ ore@@ ti@@ cally , it does , and if you look at ol@@ der te@@ x@@ ts , then people used it to actually indi@@ cate l@@ augh@@ ing out l@@ ou@@ d ."
"But if you te@@ xt now , or if you are someone who is aw@@ are of the sub@@ str@@ ate of te@@ x@@ ting the way it &apos;s become , you &apos;ll noti@@ ce that L@@ O@@ L does not mean l@@ augh@@ ing out l@@ ou@@ d any@@ more ."
It &apos;s ev@@ olved into something that is much sub@@ t@@ ler .
This is an ac@@ tu@@ al te@@ xt that was done by a n@@ on-@@ m@@ ale person of about 20 years old not too long ago .
"&quot; I love the f@@ on@@ t you &apos;re using , b@@ t@@ w . &quot;"
"J@@ ul@@ ie : &quot; &quot; lo@@ l th@@ an@@ ks g@@ ma@@ il is being s@@ low right now &quot; &quot; Now if you think about it , that &apos;s not fun@@ ny ."
"No one &apos;s l@@ augh@@ ing . ( Laughter ) And yet , there it is , so you as@@ su@@ me there &apos;s been some kind of hi@@ c@@ cu@@ p ."
"Th@@ en S@@ us@@ an says &quot; &quot; lo@@ l , I know , &quot; &quot; again more gu@@ f@@ f@@ aw@@ ing than we &apos;re used to when you &apos;re talking about these in@@ con@@ ven@@ ien@@ ces ."
"So J@@ ul@@ ie says , &quot; &quot; I just s@@ ent you an e@@ ma@@ il . &quot; &quot; S@@ us@@ an : &quot; &quot; lo@@ l , I see it . &quot; &quot; V@@ ery fun@@ ny people , if that &apos;s what L@@ O@@ L means ."
"This J@@ ul@@ ie says , &quot; &quot; So what &apos;s up ? &quot; &quot; S@@ us@@ an : &quot; &quot; lo@@ l , I have to write a 10 p@@ age pa@@ per . &quot; &quot; She &apos;s not am@@ used . Let &apos;s think about it ."
L@@ O@@ L is being used in a very particular way .
It &apos;s a mark@@ er of em@@ pa@@ th@@ y . It &apos;s a mark@@ er of ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation .
We lin@@ gu@@ ist@@ s call things like that pra@@ g@@ m@@ atic parti@@ cles .
A@@ ny spo@@ k@@ en language that &apos;s used by real people has them .
"If you happen to speak J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese , think about that little word &quot; &quot; ne &quot; &quot; that you use at the end of a lot of s@@ ent@@ ences ."
"If you list@@ en to the way black y@@ outh today speak , think about the use of the word &quot; &quot; y@@ o . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ole dis@@ ser@@ t@@ ations could be wri@@ t@@ ten about it , and probably are being wri@@ t@@ ten about it ."
"A pra@@ g@@ m@@ atic parti@@ cle , that &apos;s what L@@ O@@ L has gra@@ du@@ ally become ."
It &apos;s a way of using the language between ac@@ tu@@ al people .
"A@@ no@@ ther example is &quot; &quot; s@@ las@@ h . &quot; &quot; Now , we can use s@@ las@@ h in the way that we &apos;re used to , along the lin@@ es of , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to have a par@@ ty@@ -@@ s@@ las@@ h@@ -@@ net@@ working s@@ es@@ sion . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s kind of like what we &apos;re at ."
S@@ las@@ h is used in a very different way in te@@ x@@ ting am@@ ong young people today .
It &apos;s used to change the scen@@ e .
"So for example , this S@@ ally person says , &quot; So I need to find people to chi@@ ll with &quot; and J@@ ake says , &quot; &quot; Ha@@ h@@ a &quot; &quot; — you could write a dis@@ ser@@ tation about &quot; &quot; Ha@@ h@@ a &quot; &quot; too , but we don &apos;t have time for that — &quot; Ha@@ h@@ a so you &apos;re going by yourself ? Why ? &quot;"
S@@ ally : &quot; &quot; F@@ or this sum@@ m@@ er program at N@@ Y@@ U . &quot; &quot; J@@ ake : &quot; &quot; Ha@@ h@@ a . S@@ las@@ h I &apos;m wat@@ ching this video with su@@ ns pla@@ y@@ ers trying to sho@@ ot with one ey@@ e . &quot; &quot; The s@@ las@@ h is interesting .
"I don &apos;t really even know what J@@ ake is talking about after that , but you noti@@ ce that he &apos;s chang@@ ing the top@@ ic ."
"Now that seem@@ s kind of mu@@ n@@ dane , but think about how in real life , if we &apos;re having a convers@@ ation and we want to change the top@@ ic , there are ways of doing it g@@ rac@@ e@@ fully ."
You don &apos;t just zi@@ p right into it .
"You &apos;ll p@@ at your th@@ igh@@ s and look wi@@ st@@ fully off into the di@@ stance , or you &apos;ll say something like , &quot; &quot; H@@ m@@ m , makes you think — &quot; &quot; when it really didn &apos;t , but what you &apos;re really — ( Laughter ) — what you &apos;re really trying to do is change the top@@ ic ."
"You can &apos;t do that while you &apos;re te@@ x@@ ting , and so ways are develo@@ ping of doing it within this medi@@ um ."
"A@@ ll spo@@ k@@ en langu@@ ages have what a lin@@ gu@@ i@@ st cal@@ ls a new information mark@@ er — or two , or three ."
T@@ ex@@ ting has develo@@ ped one from this s@@ las@@ h .
"So we have a whole bat@@ tery of new con@@ stru@@ ctions that are develo@@ ping , and yet it &apos;s e@@ asy to think , well , something is still wrong ."
There &apos;s a l@@ ack of structure of some sort .
It &apos;s not as s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated as the language of The W@@ all St@@ re@@ et J@@ our@@ na@@ l .
"Well , the fact of the matter is , look at this person in 19@@ 5@@ 6 , and this is when te@@ x@@ ting doesn &apos;t exi@@ st , &quot; &quot; I L@@ o@@ ve Lu@@ cy &quot; &quot; is still on the air ."
"&quot; &quot; M@@ any do not know the al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t or mul@@ ti@@ p@@ lic@@ ation table , cannot write gra@@ m@@ m@@ ati@@ cally — &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve heard that sort of thing before , not just in 19@@ 5@@ 6 . 19@@ 1@@ 7 , Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ cut scho@@ ol@@ teach@@ er ."
"@@ 19@@ 1@@ 7 . This is the time when we all as@@ su@@ me that everything some@@ how in terms of writing was perfe@@ ct because the people on &quot; &quot; D@@ ow@@ n@@ ton A@@ b@@ be@@ y &quot; &quot; are arti@@ cul@@ ate , or something like that ."
"So , &quot; &quot; F@@ ro@@ m every colle@@ ge in the country goes up the c@@ ry , &apos; O@@ ur fre@@ sh@@ men can &apos;t spe@@ ll , can &apos;t pun@@ ctu@@ ate . &apos; &quot; &quot; And so on . You can go even f@@ ur@@ ther back than this ."
It &apos;s the P@@ resi@@ dent of H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard . It &apos;s 1@@ 8@@ 7@@ 1 .
There &apos;s no electri@@ city . Pe@@ ople have three na@@ mes .
"&quot; &quot; B@@ ad spe@@ l@@ ling , in@@ cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ness as well as in@@ ele@@ g@@ ance of ex@@ pres@@ sion in writing . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s talking about people who are o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se well pre@@ par@@ ed for colle@@ ge stud@@ ies ."
You can go even f@@ ur@@ ther back .
"@@ 1@@ 8@@ 4@@ 1 , some lon@@ g@@ -@@ lost super@@ inten@@ dent of scho@@ ols is up@@ set because of what he has for a long time &quot; &quot; not@@ ed with re@@ gre@@ t the almost entire neg@@ le@@ ct of the ori@@ gin@@ al &quot; &quot; b@@ la@@ h b@@ la@@ h b@@ la@@ h b@@ la@@ h b@@ la@@ h ."
O@@ r you can go all the way back to 6@@ 3 A@@ .@@ D@@ . — ( Laughter ) — and there &apos;s this po@@ or man who doesn &apos;t like the way people are spe@@ aking L@@ at@@ in .
"As it happens , he was writing about what had become F@@ ren@@ ch ."
"And so , there are always — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) — there are always people wor@@ ry@@ ing about these things and the planet some@@ how seem@@ s to keep sp@@ in@@ ning ."
"And so , the way I &apos;m thinking of te@@ x@@ ting these days is that what we &apos;re seeing is a whole new way of writing that young people are develo@@ ping , which they &apos;re using al@@ on@@ g@@ side their ordin@@ ary writing sk@@ il@@ ls , and that means that they &apos;re able to do two things ."
In@@ cre@@ as@@ ing evi@@ dence is that being bi@@ lin@@ gu@@ al is cogni@@ ti@@ vely b@@ ene@@ fi@@ cial .
That &apos;s also true of being bi@@ di@@ ale@@ ct@@ al .
That &apos;s cer@@ tain@@ ly true of being bi@@ di@@ ale@@ ct@@ al in terms of your writing .
"And so te@@ x@@ ting actually is evi@@ dence of a bal@@ an@@ cing act that young people are using today , not con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously , of course , but it &apos;s an ex@@ pan@@ sion of their lin@@ gu@@ i@@ stic re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re ."
It &apos;s very simple .
"If somebody from 19@@ 7@@ 3 looked at what was on a d@@ or@@ mi@@ t@@ ory mess@@ age bo@@ ard in 199@@ 3 , the s@@ lan@@ g would have changed a little bit since the era of &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ve St@@ ory , &quot; &quot; but they would understand what was on that mess@@ age bo@@ ard ."
"T@@ ake that person from 199@@ 3 — not that long ago , this is &quot; &quot; Bi@@ ll and T@@ ed &apos;s E@@ x@@ cel@@ l@@ ent A@@ d@@ ven@@ ture &quot; &quot; — those people ."
T@@ ake those people and they read a very ty@@ pi@@ cal te@@ xt wri@@ t@@ ten by a 20@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old today .
O@@ f@@ ten they would have no idea what half of it me@@ ant because a whole new language has develo@@ ped am@@ ong our young people doing something as mu@@ n@@ dane as what it looks like to us when they &apos;re bat@@ ting around on their little de@@ vi@@ ces .
"So in clo@@ sing , if I could go into the future , if I could go into 20@@ 3@@ 3 , the first thing I would ask is whether Davi@@ d S@@ im@@ on had done a sequ@@ el to &quot; &quot; The Wi@@ re . &quot; &quot; I would want to know ."
And — I really would ask that — and then I &apos;d want to know actually what was going on on &quot; &quot; D@@ ow@@ n@@ ton A@@ b@@ be@@ y . &quot; &quot; That &apos;d be the second thing .
"And then the third thing would be , ple@@ ase show me a sh@@ e@@ a@@ f of te@@ x@@ ts wri@@ t@@ ten by 1@@ 6@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old girls , because I would want to know where this language had develo@@ ped since our times , and ide@@ ally I would then sen@@ d them back to you and me now so we could exam@@ ine this lin@@ gu@@ i@@ stic mi@@ rac@@ le happening right under our no@@ ses ."
Thank you very much .

"As she was moving in , he told Y@@ us@@ or and her mo@@ m that he didn &apos;t like the way they looked ."
I gu@@ ess we &apos;ve all become so num@@ b to the h@@ at@@ red that we couldn &apos;t have ever imag@@ ined it tur@@ ning into f@@ at@@ al violence .
It turns out there was no par@@ king disp@@ u@@ te .
There was no ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent .
No viol@@ ation .
But the dam@@ age was already done .
"In a 2@@ 4@@ -@@ hour media cy@@ cle , the words &quot; &quot; par@@ king disp@@ u@@ te &quot; &quot; had already become the go@@ -@@ to sound bi@@ te ."
"I si@@ t on my bro@@ ther &apos;s bed and remember his words , the words he gave me so fre@@ ely and with so much love , &quot; I am who I am because of you . &quot;"
"They were mu@@ r@@ der@@ ed by their neigh@@ b@@ or because of their fai@@ th , because of a piece of c@@ lot@@ h they cho@@ se to don on their he@@ ads , because they were visi@@ bly M@@ us@@ li@@ m ."
A ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ st att@@ ack .
"When white men comm@@ it ac@@ ts of violence in the U@@ S , they &apos;re l@@ one wol@@ ves , ment@@ ally i@@ ll or dri@@ ven by a par@@ king disp@@ u@@ te ."
"I know that I have to give my family vo@@ ice , and I do the only thing I know how : I sen@@ d a F@@ ace@@ book mess@@ age to everyone I know in media ."
"A couple of hours later , in the mi@@ d@@ st of a cha@@ oti@@ c house over@@ f@@ low@@ ing with friends and family , our neigh@@ b@@ or Ne@@ al comes over , si@@ ts down next to my parents and as@@ ks , &quot; &quot; What can I do ? &quot; &quot; Ne@@ al had over two de@@ ca@@ des of experience in jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sm , but he makes it clear that he &apos;s not there in his ca@@ pac@@ ity as jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st , but as a neigh@@ b@@ or who wan@@ ts to help ."
"I ask him what he thin@@ ks we should do , given the b@@ om@@ bar@@ d@@ ment of local media inter@@ view re@@ qu@@ est@@ s ."
He of@@ f@@ ers to set up a pre@@ ss con@@ fer@@ ence at a local community cen@@ ter .
E@@ ven now I don &apos;t have the words to th@@ ank him .
"&quot; &quot; J@@ ust tell me when , and I &apos;ll have all the news ch@@ an@@ ne@@ ls present , &quot; &quot; he said ."

The least we can do is call it what it is : a h@@ ate cri@@ me .
"The least we can do is talk about it , because violence and h@@ at@@ red doesn &apos;t just happen in a vac@@ u@@ um ."
"H@@ ere I am having just lost three family mem@@ bers to Is@@ la@@ mo@@ ph@@ ob@@ ia , having been a vo@@ cal adv@@ oc@@ ate within my program on how to deal with such micro@@ ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sions , and yet — sil@@ ence ."

A couple of things .
"He was there as a neigh@@ b@@ or who car@@ ed , but he was also br@@ ing@@ ing in his prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal exper@@ ti@@ se and re@@ sources when the moment called for it ."
O@@ thers have done the same .

"I got a visi@@ t almost exactly a year ago , a little over a year ago , from a very s@@ eni@@ or person at the De@@ part@@ ment of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se ."
"C@@ ame to see me and said , &quot; &quot; 1@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 of the kids that we &apos;ve s@@ ent out have come back mis@@ sing at least one full ar@@ m ."
Wh@@ ole ar@@ m . S@@ hou@@ l@@ der dis@@ arti@@ cul@@ ation .
"And we &apos;re doing the same thing we did for — more or less , that we &apos;ve done since the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar , a sti@@ ck and a ho@@ ok ."
"And they des@@ er@@ ve more than that . &quot; &quot; And liter@@ ally , this guy s@@ at in my offi@@ ce in New H@@ am@@ p@@ shi@@ re and said , &quot; &quot; I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids that &apos;ll pi@@ ck up a ra@@ i@@ si@@ n or a gra@@ pe off a table , they &apos;ll be able to put it in their m@@ outh without de@@ stro@@ ying either one , and they &apos;ll be able to know the difference without looking at it . &quot; &quot; You know , had ef@@ fer@@ ent , af@@ fer@@ ent , and ha@@ p@@ tic respon@@ se ."
"He fini@@ sh@@ es expla@@ ining that , and I &apos;m wai@@ ting for the big 3@@ 00 po@@ u@@ nd pa@@ per pro@@ pos@@ al , and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I want from you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , you &apos;re nu@@ ts .

And it can &apos;t be done .
"N@@ ot in an en@@ velo@@ pe of a human ar@@ m , with 2@@ 1 de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom , from your sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der to your fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ out two do@@ z@@ en of these 1@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 kids have come back bi@@ lat@@ er@@ al ."
You think it &apos;s bad to lo@@ se one ar@@ m ?
"That &apos;s an in@@ con@@ ven@@ ience com@@ par@@ ed to having both of them gone . &quot; &quot; I got a day job , and my ni@@ ghts and we@@ ek@@ en@@ ds are already fil@@ led up with things like , let &apos;s su@@ pp@@ ly water to the world , and power to the world , and edu@@ cate all the kids , which , Ch@@ ris , I will not talk about . I don &apos;t need another mis@@ sion ."
I keep thinking about these kids with no ar@@ ms .
"He says to me , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve done some work around the country ."
"We &apos;ve got some pretty amazing neuro@@ logy and other people . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll take a fie@@ ld tri@@ p , I &apos;ll go see what you got . &quot; &quot; O@@ ver the next mon@@ th I visi@@ ted lots of places , some out here , around the country , found the best of the best ."
"I went down to W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton . I saw these guys , and said , &quot; &quot; I did what you asked me . I looked at what &apos;s out there ."
"I still think you &apos;re nu@@ ts . But not as nu@@ ts as I thought . &quot; &quot; I put a team together , a little over 1@@ 3 months ago , got up to 20 some@@ -@@ od@@ d people ."
"We said , we &apos;re going to build a de@@ vice that does what he wan@@ ts ."
We have 14 out of the 2@@ 1 de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom ; you don &apos;t need the ones in the last two fin@@ g@@ ers .
We put this thing together .
"A couple of weeks ago we took it down to W@@ al@@ ter Re@@ ed , which is un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely more in the news these days ."
We show@@ ed it to a bu@@ n@@ ch of guys .
"One guy who descri@@ bed hi@@ m@@ self as being lu@@ ck@@ y , because he lost his left ar@@ m , and he &apos;s a ri@@ gh@@ ty ."
He s@@ at at a table with seven or eight of these other guys .
"S@@ a@@ id he was lu@@ ck@@ y , because he had his good ar@@ m , and then he p@@ us@@ h@@ ed hi@@ m@@ self back from the table . He had no le@@ gs ."
These kids have at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des that you just can &apos;t believe .
"So I &apos;m going to show you now , without the sk@@ in on it , a 3@@ 0-@@ second piece , and then I &apos;m done ."
"But understand what you &apos;re looking at we made small enough to f@@ it on a 5@@ 0@@ th per@@ cen@@ ti@@ le fe@@ m@@ ale , so that we could put it in any of these people ."
"It &apos;s going to go inside something that we use in C@@ A@@ T sc@@ ans and M@@ R@@ Is of whatever is their good ar@@ m , to make si@@ lic@@ on ru@@ b@@ ber , then co@@ at it , and pa@@ int it in 3@@ D — ex@@ act mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r image of their other lim@@ b ."
"So , you won &apos;t see all the really cool stuff that &apos;s in this ser@@ ies el@@ a@@ stic set of 14 ac@@ tu@@ at@@ ors , each one which has its own cap@@ ability to sense temper@@ ature and pres@@ sure ."
"It also has a p@@ ne@@ um@@ atic cu@@ ff that hol@@ ds it on , so the more they put themselves under lo@@ ad , the more it att@@ ach@@ es ."
"They take the lo@@ ad off , and it be@@ comes , again , comp@@ li@@ ant ."
I &apos;m going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton . C@@ an we look at this thing ?
W@@ at@@ ch the fin@@ g@@ ers gra@@ b . The th@@ um@@ b comes up . W@@ ri@@ st .
This we@@ igh@@ s 6@@ .@@ 9 po@@ un@@ ds .
Go@@ ing to sc@@ rat@@ ch his no@@ se .
It &apos;s got 14 ac@@ tive de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom .
Now he &apos;s going to pi@@ ck up a p@@ en with his op@@ posed th@@ um@@ b and in@@ de@@ x fin@@ ger .
"Now he &apos;s going to put that down , pi@@ ck up a piece of pa@@ per , ro@@ t@@ ate all the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom in his hand and wri@@ st , and read it ."
( Applause )
I &apos;ve noti@@ ced something interesting about society and culture .
"For some reason , there &apos;s no stan@@ d@@ ard sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us , there &apos;s no basi@@ c course ."
The space b@@ ar sc@@ rol@@ ls down one p@@ age .
You make the te@@ xt lar@@ ger with each ta@@ p .
"G@@ o space , space ."
D@@ ou@@ ble cli@@ ck the word .
"A@@ l@@ so , don &apos;t de@@ le@@ te what you &apos;ve high@@ li@@ gh@@ ted ."
You can just ty@@ pe over it .
So I know I went su@@ per f@@ ast .
"This is our life with bees , and this is our life without bees ."
Be@@ es are the most important pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors of our f@@ ru@@ its and ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les and f@@ low@@ ers and cro@@ ps like al@@ fal@@ f@@ a ha@@ y that fe@@ ed our far@@ m animals .
M@@ ore than one third of the world &apos;s cro@@ p produ@@ ction is depen@@ dent on be@@ e pol@@ lin@@ ation .
But the i@@ ro@@ nic thing is that bees are not out there pol@@ lin@@ ating our food inten@@ tion@@ ally .
They &apos;re out there because they need to e@@ at .
Be@@ es get all of the prote@@ in they need in their d@@ ie@@ t from pol@@ le@@ n and all of the car@@ bo@@ hy@@ d@@ r@@ ates they need from ne@@ ct@@ ar .
"They &apos;re f@@ low@@ er@@ -@@ fe@@ ed@@ ers , and as they move from f@@ low@@ er to f@@ low@@ er , basically on a sh@@ op@@ ping tri@@ p at the local fl@@ or@@ al mar@@ t , they end up provi@@ ding this val@@ u@@ able pol@@ lin@@ ation ser@@ vice ."
"In par@@ ts of the world where there are no bees , or where they pl@@ ant v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties that are not at@@ trac@@ tive to bees , people are pa@@ id to do the business of pol@@ lin@@ ation by hand ."
These people are moving pol@@ le@@ n from f@@ low@@ er to f@@ low@@ er with a pain@@ t@@ br@@ us@@ h .
Now this business of hand pol@@ lin@@ ation is actually not that un@@ common .
T@@ om@@ a@@ to grow@@ ers often pol@@ lin@@ ate their tom@@ a@@ to f@@ low@@ ers with a hand@@ -@@ he@@ ld vi@@ br@@ ator .
"Now this one &apos;s the tom@@ a@@ to ti@@ ck@@ ler . ( Laughter ) Now this is because the pol@@ le@@ n within a tom@@ a@@ to f@@ low@@ er is he@@ ld very secu@@ re@@ ly within the m@@ ale part of the f@@ low@@ er , the an@@ ther , and the only way to rele@@ ase this pol@@ le@@ n is to vi@@ br@@ ate it ."
"So bu@@ m@@ b@@ le@@ bees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to h@@ old on@@ to the f@@ low@@ er and vi@@ br@@ ate it , and they do this by sha@@ king their f@@ light mus@@ cles at a fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy si@@ mi@@ lar to the musi@@ cal not@@ e C@@ ."
"So they vi@@ br@@ ate the f@@ low@@ er , they s@@ oni@@ cate it , and that rele@@ ases the pol@@ le@@ n in this ef@@ fi@@ cient swo@@ os@@ h , and the pol@@ le@@ n ga@@ thers all over the fu@@ z@@ zy be@@ e &apos;s body , and she takes it home as food ."
T@@ om@@ a@@ to grow@@ ers now put bu@@ m@@ b@@ le@@ be@@ e col@@ on@@ ies inside the gre@@ en@@ house to pol@@ lin@@ ate the tom@@ at@@ o@@ es because they get much more ef@@ fi@@ cient pol@@ lin@@ ation when it &apos;s done natur@@ ally and they get better qu@@ ality tom@@ at@@ o@@ es .
"So there &apos;s other , maybe more per@@ s@@ onal reas@@ ons , to care about bees ."
"There &apos;s over 20@@ ,000 species of bees in the world , and they &apos;re absolu@@ tely gor@@ ge@@ ous ."
These bees spend the maj@@ ori@@ ty of their life cy@@ cle hi@@ d@@ den in the ground or within a hol@@ low stem and very few of these beautiful species have ev@@ olved high@@ ly social behavi@@ or like hon@@ ey@@ bees .
"Now hon@@ ey@@ bees ten@@ d to be the char@@ is@@ m@@ atic re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative for the other 19@@ ,@@ 9@@ 0@@ 0-@@ p@@ lu@@ s species because there &apos;s something about hon@@ ey@@ bees that d@@ raw@@ s people into their world ."
"H@@ um@@ ans have been d@@ raw@@ n to hon@@ ey@@ bees since early recor@@ ded history , mo@@ st@@ ly to har@@ v@@ est their hon@@ ey , which is an amazing natural s@@ wee@@ ten@@ er ."
I got d@@ raw@@ n into the hon@@ ey@@ be@@ e world completely by a flu@@ ke .
"I was 18 years old and bo@@ red , and I pi@@ cked up a book in the li@@ br@@ ary on bees and I spent the night re@@ ading it ."
I had never thought about in@@ se@@ cts living in comple@@ x socie@@ ties .
It was like the best of science fi@@ ction come true .
"And even str@@ ang@@ er , there were these people , these be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ per@@ s , that lo@@ ved their bees like they were family , and when I put down the book , I knew I had to see this for myself ."
"So I went to work for a comm@@ er@@ cial be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ per , a family that ow@@ ned 2@@ ,000 hi@@ ves of bees in New M@@ exi@@ co ."
And I was per@@ man@@ ently ho@@ o@@ ked .
"H@@ on@@ ey@@ bees can be consi@@ der@@ ed a super@@ -@@ organi@@ sm , where the col@@ ony is the organi@@ sm and it &apos;s comp@@ ri@@ sed of 4@@ 0,000 to 5@@ 0,000 individu@@ al be@@ e organi@@ s@@ ms ."
Now this society has no cent@@ ral au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty .
N@@ ob@@ ody &apos;s in char@@ ge .
"So how they come to colle@@ ctive deci@@ sions , and how they al@@ lo@@ cate their t@@ as@@ ks and di@@ vi@@ de their lab@@ or , how they communi@@ cate where the f@@ low@@ ers are , all of their colle@@ ctive social behavi@@ ors are min@@ d@@ b@@ low@@ ing ."
"My per@@ s@@ onal fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te , and one that I &apos;ve stud@@ ied for many years , is their system of health@@ care ."
So bees have social health@@ care .
"So in my la@@ b , we study how bees keep themselves health@@ y ."
"For example , we study hy@@ g@@ ie@@ ne , where some bees are able to lo@@ cate and we@@ ed out si@@ ck individu@@ als from the n@@ est , from the col@@ ony , and it ke@@ e@@ ps the col@@ ony health@@ y ."
"And more re@@ cent@@ ly , we &apos;ve been stu@@ dy@@ ing re@@ s@@ ins that bees colle@@ ct from plan@@ ts ."
"So bees f@@ ly to some plan@@ ts and they sc@@ ra@@ pe these very , very sti@@ ck@@ y re@@ s@@ ins off the lea@@ ves , and they take them back to the n@@ est where they c@@ ement them into the n@@ est archite@@ cture where we call it pro@@ pol@@ is ."
We &apos;ve found that pro@@ pol@@ is is a natural dis@@ in@@ fe@@ ct@@ ant .
It &apos;s a natural anti@@ bi@@ oti@@ c .
"It kil@@ ls off bac@@ ter@@ ia and mo@@ l@@ ds and other ger@@ ms within the col@@ ony , and so it b@@ ol@@ st@@ ers the col@@ ony health and their social im@@ muni@@ ty ."
H@@ um@@ ans have known about the power of pro@@ pol@@ is since bi@@ bli@@ cal times .
"We &apos;ve been har@@ v@@ est@@ ing pro@@ pol@@ is out of be@@ e col@@ on@@ ies for human medi@@ cine , but we didn &apos;t know how good it was for the bees ."
So hon@@ ey@@ bees have these re@@ mark@@ able natural def@@ en@@ ses that have ke@@ pt them health@@ y and th@@ ri@@ ving for over 50 million years .
"So seven years ago , when hon@@ ey@@ be@@ e col@@ on@@ ies were re@@ por@@ ted to be dy@@ ing en mas@@ se , first in the United States , it was clear that there was something really , really wrong ."
"In our colle@@ ctive con@@ science , in a really pri@@ mal way , we know we can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d to lo@@ se bees ."
So what &apos;s going on ?
"Be@@ es are dy@@ ing from mul@@ ti@@ ple and inter@@ ac@@ ting ca@@ uses , and I &apos;ll go through each of these ."
"The bot@@ tom line is , bees dy@@ ing ref@@ le@@ cts a f@@ low@@ er@@ less land@@ s@@ cape and a dy@@ s@@ fun@@ cti@@ onal food system ."
"Now we have the best data on hon@@ ey@@ bees , so I &apos;ll use them as an example ."
"In the United States , bees in fact have been in dec@@ line since World W@@ ar I@@ I ."
We have half the number of man@@ aged hi@@ ves in the United States now com@@ par@@ ed to 19@@ 4@@ 5 .
"We &apos;re down to about two million hi@@ ves of bees , we think ."
"And the reason is , after World W@@ ar I@@ I , we changed our far@@ ming prac@@ ti@@ ces ."
We stop@@ ped plan@@ ting co@@ ver cro@@ ps .
"We stop@@ ped plan@@ ting clo@@ ver and al@@ fal@@ f@@ a , which are natural fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers that fi@@ x ni@@ tro@@ g@@ en in the so@@ il , and instead we started using syn@@ the@@ tic fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers ."
C@@ lo@@ ver and al@@ fal@@ f@@ a are high@@ ly n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ti@@ ous food plan@@ ts for bees .
"And after World W@@ ar I@@ I , we started using her@@ bi@@ ci@@ des to ki@@ ll off the we@@ eds in our far@@ ms ."
M@@ any of these we@@ eds are f@@ low@@ ering plan@@ ts that bees requi@@ re for their survi@@ v@@ al .
And we started grow@@ ing lar@@ ger and lar@@ ger cro@@ p mon@@ o@@ cul@@ tu@@ res .
"Now we talk about food des@@ er@@ ts , places in our cities , neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods that have no gro@@ cer@@ y sto@@ res ."
"The very far@@ ms that used to susta@@ in bees are now agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral food des@@ er@@ ts , dom@@ in@@ ated by one or two pl@@ ant species like cor@@ n and so@@ y@@ be@@ ans ."
"S@@ in@@ ce World W@@ ar I@@ I , we have been system@@ ati@@ cally e@@ li@@ min@@ ating many of the f@@ low@@ ering plan@@ ts that bees need for their survi@@ v@@ al ."
"And these mon@@ o@@ cul@@ tu@@ res ex@@ ten@@ d even to cro@@ ps that are good for bees , like al@@ mon@@ ds ."
"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty years ago , be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ per@@ s would take a few col@@ on@@ ies , hi@@ ves of bees into the al@@ mon@@ d or@@ char@@ ds , for pol@@ lin@@ ation , and also because the pol@@ le@@ n in an al@@ mon@@ d blo@@ s@@ so@@ m is really high in prote@@ in . It &apos;s really good for bees ."
"Now , the scale of al@@ mon@@ d mon@@ o@@ culture de@@ man@@ ds that most of our n@@ ation &apos;s bees , over 1@@ .@@ 5 million hi@@ ves of bees , be transpor@@ ted across the n@@ ation to pol@@ lin@@ ate this one cro@@ p ."
"And they &apos;re tru@@ cked in in se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ ads , and they must be tru@@ cked out , because after blo@@ om , the al@@ mon@@ d or@@ char@@ ds are a v@@ ast and f@@ low@@ er@@ less land@@ s@@ cape ."
"Be@@ es have been dy@@ ing over the last 50 years , and we &apos;re plan@@ ting more cro@@ ps that need them ."
There has been a 3@@ 00 percent incre@@ ase in cro@@ p produ@@ ction that requi@@ res be@@ e pol@@ lin@@ ation .
And then there &apos;s pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des .
"A@@ f@@ ter World W@@ ar I@@ I , we started using pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des on a large scale , and this became ne@@ cess@@ ary because of the mon@@ o@@ cul@@ tu@@ res that put out a fe@@ ast for cro@@ p pe@@ sts ."
"R@@ e@@ cent@@ ly , resear@@ ch@@ ers from P@@ en@@ n St@@ ate Uni@@ versity have started looking at the pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ de resi@@ du@@ e in the lo@@ ads of pol@@ le@@ n that bees car@@ ry home as food , and they &apos;ve found that every bat@@ ch of pol@@ le@@ n that a hon@@ ey@@ be@@ e colle@@ cts has at least six de@@ te@@ ct@@ able pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des in it , and this inclu@@ des every clas@@ s of in@@ se@@ cti@@ ci@@ des , her@@ bi@@ ci@@ des , fun@@ gi@@ ci@@ des , and even in@@ er@@ t and un@@ la@@ be@@ led in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ ts that are part of the pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ de for@@ mul@@ ation that can be more to@@ x@@ ic than the ac@@ tive in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ t ."
This small be@@ e is hol@@ ding up a large mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r .
How much is it going to take to cont@@ am@@ in@@ ate hum@@ ans ?
"One of these clas@@ s of in@@ se@@ cti@@ ci@@ des , the ne@@ oni@@ contin@@ o@@ i@@ ds , is making he@@ ad@@ lin@@ es around the world right now ."
You &apos;ve probably heard about it .
This is a new clas@@ s of in@@ se@@ cti@@ ci@@ des .
"It mo@@ ves through the pl@@ ant so that a cro@@ p p@@ est , a le@@ af@@ -@@ e@@ ating in@@ se@@ ct , would take a bi@@ te of the pl@@ ant and get a le@@ th@@ al do@@ se and die ."
"If one of these ne@@ oni@@ cs , we call them , is ap@@ pl@@ ied in a high con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation , such as in this ground app@@ lic@@ ation , enough of the com@@ po@@ u@@ nd mo@@ ves through the pl@@ ant and gets into the pol@@ le@@ n and the ne@@ ct@@ ar , where a be@@ e can con@@ su@@ me , in this case , a high do@@ se of this neuro@@ to@@ x@@ in that makes the be@@ e t@@ wit@@ ch and die ."
"In most agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral se@@ t@@ t@@ ings , on most of our far@@ ms , it &apos;s only the se@@ ed that &apos;s co@@ ated with the in@@ se@@ cti@@ ci@@ de , and so a s@@ mal@@ ler con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation mo@@ ves through the pl@@ ant and gets into the pol@@ le@@ n and ne@@ ct@@ ar , and if a be@@ e con@@ su@@ mes this low@@ er do@@ se , either nothing happens or the be@@ e be@@ comes in@@ to@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ ated and di@@ sor@@ ien@@ ted and she may not find her way home ."
"And on top of everything else , bees have their own set of dise@@ ases and par@@ a@@ si@@ tes ."
P@@ u@@ bli@@ c ene@@ my number one for bees is this thing .
It &apos;s called v@@ ar@@ ro@@ a de@@ stru@@ ctor .
It &apos;s ap@@ tly na@@ med .
"It &apos;s this big , blo@@ od@@ -@@ suc@@ king par@@ a@@ site that com@@ pro@@ mis@@ es the be@@ e &apos;s im@@ mu@@ ne system and cir@@ cu@@ lat@@ es vi@@ rus@@ es ."
Let me put this all together for you .
"I don &apos;t know what it feel@@ s like to a be@@ e to have a big , blo@@ od@@ suc@@ king par@@ a@@ site ru@@ n@@ ning around on it , and I don &apos;t know what it feel@@ s like to a be@@ e to have a vi@@ ru@@ s , but I do know what it feel@@ s like when I have a vi@@ ru@@ s , the f@@ lu , and I know how difficult it is for me to get to the gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e to get good n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion ."
But what if I li@@ ved in a food des@@ er@@ t ?
"And what if I had to tra@@ vel a long di@@ stance to get to the gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e , and I finally got my we@@ ak body out there and I con@@ sum@@ ed , in my food , enough of a pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ de , a neuro@@ to@@ x@@ in , that I couldn &apos;t find my way home ?"
And this is what we mean by mul@@ ti@@ ple and inter@@ ac@@ ting ca@@ uses of death .
And it &apos;s not just our hon@@ ey@@ bees .
"A@@ ll of our beautiful wi@@ ld species of bees are at ri@@ sk , inclu@@ ding those tom@@ at@@ o@@ -@@ pol@@ lin@@ ating bu@@ m@@ b@@ le@@ bees ."
These bees are provi@@ ding back@@ up for our hon@@ ey@@ bees .
They &apos;re provi@@ ding the pol@@ lin@@ ation in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce al@@ on@@ g@@ side our hon@@ ey@@ bees .
We need all of our bees .
So what are we going to do ?
What are we going to do about this big be@@ e bu@@ m@@ m@@ er that we &apos;ve created ?
"It turns out , it &apos;s hop@@ e@@ ful . It &apos;s hop@@ e@@ ful ."
E@@ very one of you out there can help bees in two very dire@@ ct and e@@ asy ways .
"P@@ l@@ ant be@@ e-@@ frien@@ d@@ ly f@@ low@@ ers , and don &apos;t cont@@ am@@ in@@ ate these f@@ low@@ ers , this be@@ e food , with pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des ."
So go on@@ line and sear@@ ch for f@@ low@@ ers that are n@@ ative to your area and pl@@ ant them .
P@@ l@@ ant them in a po@@ t on your do@@ or@@ ste@@ p .
"P@@ l@@ ant them in your front y@@ ard , in your l@@ aw@@ ns , in your b@@ ou@@ le@@ v@@ ar@@ ds ."
"C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to have them plan@@ ted in public gar@@ den@@ s , community sp@@ ac@@ es , me@@ ad@@ ow@@ s ."
S@@ et a@@ side farm@@ land .
"We need a beautiful di@@ versity of f@@ low@@ ers that blo@@ oms over the entire grow@@ ing se@@ as@@ on , from sp@@ ring to f@@ all ."
"We need ro@@ ad@@ si@@ des se@@ ed@@ ed in f@@ low@@ ers for our bees , but also for mi@@ gr@@ ating bu@@ t@@ ter@@ fl@@ ies and bir@@ ds and other wil@@ d@@ life ."
And we need to think car@@ e@@ fully about pu@@ tting back in co@@ ver cro@@ ps to n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh our so@@ il and n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh our bees .
And we need to di@@ ver@@ si@@ fy our far@@ ms .
We need to pl@@ ant f@@ low@@ ering cro@@ p bor@@ ders and he@@ dge row@@ s to dis@@ ru@@ pt the agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral food des@@ er@@ t and beg@@ in to cor@@ re@@ ct the dy@@ s@@ fun@@ cti@@ onal food system that we &apos;ve created .
"So maybe it seem@@ s like a really small coun@@ ter@@ meas@@ ure to a big , huge problem — just go pl@@ ant f@@ low@@ ers — but when bees have ac@@ cess to good n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion , we have ac@@ cess to good n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion through their pol@@ lin@@ ation ser@@ vi@@ ces ."
"And when bees have ac@@ cess to good n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion , they &apos;re better able to eng@@ age their own natural def@@ en@@ ses , their health@@ care , that they have re@@ lie@@ d on for mi@@ llions of years ."
"So the beau@@ ty of hel@@ ping bees this way , for me , is that every one of us needs to be@@ have a little bit more like a be@@ e society , an in@@ se@@ ct society , where each of our individu@@ al ac@@ tions can con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to a gr@@ and solution , an em@@ er@@ g@@ ent pro@@ per@@ ty , that &apos;s much gre@@ ater than the m@@ ere su@@ m of our individu@@ al ac@@ tions ."
So let the small act of plan@@ ting f@@ low@@ ers and ke@@ e@@ ping them f@@ ree of pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des be the dri@@ ver of lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale change .
"O@@ n be@@ half of the bees , th@@ ank you ."
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . J@@ ust a qui@@ ck question .
"The lat@@ est num@@ bers on the d@@ ie@@ -@@ off of bees , is there any sig@@ n of things bot@@ tom@@ ing out ?"
What &apos;s your hope / de@@ pres@@ sion level on this ?
Mar@@ ia S@@ pi@@ v@@ ak : Yeah .
"A@@ t least in the United States , an a@@ ver@@ age of 30 percent of all be@@ e hi@@ ves are lost every win@@ ter ."
"A@@ b@@ out 20 years ago , we were at a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ percent lo@@ ss ."
So it &apos;s getting pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous .
"CA : That &apos;s not 30 percent a year , that &apos;s — M@@ S : Yes , th@@ ir@@ ty percent a year ."
"CA : Th@@ ir@@ ty percent a year . M@@ S : But then be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ per@@ s are able to di@@ vi@@ de their col@@ on@@ ies and so they can ma@@ in@@ tain the same number , they can re@@ cu@@ per@@ ate some of their lo@@ ss ."
We &apos;re kind of at a ti@@ pping point .
We can &apos;t really af@@ for@@ d to lo@@ se that many more .
We need to be really ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ative of all the be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ per@@ s out there . P@@ l@@ ant f@@ low@@ ers .
CA : Thank you .

"This is S@@ hi@@ v@@ du@@ t@@ t Y@@ ad@@ a@@ v , and he &apos;s from U@@ t@@ t@@ ar P@@ ra@@ des@@ h , Indi@@ a ."
"Now S@@ hi@@ v@@ du@@ t@@ t was visi@@ ting the local land regi@@ stry offi@@ ce in U@@ t@@ t@@ ar P@@ ra@@ des@@ h , and he disco@@ vered that offi@@ cial recor@@ ds were list@@ ing him as de@@ ad ."
H@@ is land was no longer regi@@ ster@@ ed in his name .

"F@@ ami@@ ly mem@@ bers had bri@@ bed offi@@ ci@@ als to inter@@ ru@@ pt the her@@ e@@ di@@ t@@ ary trans@@ f@@ er of land by having the bro@@ thers dec@@ lar@@ ed de@@ ad , allow@@ ing them to in@@ her@@ it their father &apos;s share of the an@@ c@@ est@@ ral farm@@ land ."
"Because of this , all three bro@@ thers and their fam@@ il@@ ies had to vac@@ ate their home ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to the Y@@ ad@@ a@@ v family , the local cour@@ t has been s@@ che@@ du@@ ling a case re@@ view since 200@@ 1 , but a ju@@ dge has never ap@@ pe@@ ared ."
There are se@@ ver@@ al in@@ stan@@ ces in U@@ t@@ t@@ ar P@@ ra@@ des@@ h of people dy@@ ing before their case is given a pro@@ per re@@ view .
S@@ hi@@ v@@ du@@ t@@ t &apos;s father &apos;s death and a want for his pro@@ per@@ ty led to this cor@@ ru@@ ption .
"He was la@@ id to rest in the G@@ ang@@ es Ri@@ ver , where the de@@ ad are cre@@ mat@@ ed along the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ ver or t@@ ied to he@@ av@@ y st@@ ones and su@@ n@@ k in the water ."
"P@@ h@@ otogra@@ ph@@ ing these bro@@ thers was a di@@ sor@@ ien@@ ting ex@@ change because on pa@@ per they don &apos;t exi@@ st , and a photogra@@ ph is so often used as an evi@@ dence of life ."
"@@ Y@@ et , these men re@@ ma@@ in de@@ ad ."
"This qu@@ and@@ ary led to the ti@@ tle of the project , which consi@@ ders in many ways that we are all the living de@@ ad and that we in some ways re@@ present gh@@ ost@@ s of the past and the future ."
"So this story is the first of 18 ch@@ ap@@ ters in my new body of work ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; A Li@@ ving M@@ an De@@ c@@ lar@@ ed De@@ ad and O@@ ther C@@ ha@@ p@@ ters . &quot; &quot; And for this work , I tra@@ ve@@ led around the world over a f@@ our@@ -@@ year per@@ i@@ od resear@@ ching and recor@@ ding blo@@ od@@ lin@@ es and their re@@ lated stories ."
"I was interested in ideas sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding f@@ ate and whether our f@@ ate is de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed by blo@@ od , ch@@ ance or cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stance ."
The sub@@ je@@ cts I do@@ cu@@ men@@ ted r@@ ang@@ ed from fe@@ u@@ ding fam@@ il@@ ies in B@@ raz@@ il to vi@@ cti@@ ms of gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de in B@@ os@@ nia to the first woman to hi@@ j@@ ack an air@@ pl@@ ane and the living de@@ ad in Indi@@ a .

E@@ ach work that I make is comp@@ ri@@ sed of three se@@ g@@ ments .
O@@ n the left are one or more por@@ tra@@ it pan@@ els in which I system@@ ati@@ cally order the mem@@ bers of a given blo@@ od@@ line .
"This is fol@@ low@@ ed by a te@@ xt pan@@ el , it &apos;s desig@@ ned in sc@@ ro@@ ll form , in which I con@@ stru@@ ct the nar@@ r@@ ative at st@@ ake ."
And then on the right is what I ref@@ er to as a fo@@ ot@@ not@@ e pan@@ el .
"It &apos;s a space that &apos;s more in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive in which I present fra@@ g@@ ments of the story , begin@@ n@@ ings of other stories , photogra@@ phi@@ c evi@@ dence ."
"And it &apos;s me@@ ant to kind of ref@@ le@@ ct how we eng@@ age with histor@@ ies or stories on the Inter@@ net , in a less lin@@ e@@ ar form ."
So it &apos;s more di@@ sor@@ der@@ ed .
And this di@@ sor@@ der is in dire@@ ct con@@ tra@@ st to the un@@ alter@@ able order of a blo@@ od@@ line .
"In my past proje@@ cts I &apos;ve often worked in seri@@ al form , do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ing things that have the ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance of being com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sive through a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed ti@@ tle and a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed pres@@ ent@@ ation , but in fact , are fa@@ ir@@ ly ab@@ strac@@ t ."
"In this project I wanted to work in the op@@ posi@@ te dire@@ ction and find an absolu@@ te cat@@ al@@ o@@ g , something that I couldn &apos;t inter@@ ru@@ pt , cur@@ ate or ed@@ it by cho@@ ice ."
This led me to blo@@ od .
A blo@@ od@@ line is de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed and or@@ der@@ ed .
But the project cen@@ ters on the col@@ li@@ sion of order and di@@ sor@@ der — the order of blo@@ od bu@@ tting up against the di@@ sor@@ der re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted in the often cha@@ oti@@ c and viol@@ ent stories that are the sub@@ je@@ cts of my ch@@ ap@@ ters .
"In ch@@ ap@@ ter two , I photogra@@ ph the des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of Ar@@ th@@ ur R@@ u@@ pp@@ in ."
He was s@@ ent in 19@@ 0@@ 7 to P@@ al@@ est@@ ine by the Z@@ i@@ oni@@ st organiz@@ ation to look at are@@ as for Je@@ wi@@ sh se@@ t@@ t@@ le@@ ment and ac@@ qui@@ re land for Je@@ wi@@ sh se@@ t@@ t@@ le@@ ment .

And these are stud@@ ies com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed by the Z@@ i@@ oni@@ st organiz@@ ation for alter@@ n@@ ative are@@ as for Je@@ wi@@ sh se@@ t@@ t@@ le@@ ment .
"In this , I was interested in the con@@ sequ@@ ences of ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y and imag@@ ining how the world would be different if Is@@ ra@@ el were in U@@ g@@ an@@ da , which is what these ma@@ ps de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate ."

"As a resul@@ t of these trans@@ ac@@ tions , J@@ ur@@ a has n@@ ine wi@@ ves , 3@@ 2 children and 6@@ 3 grand@@ children ."
In his blo@@ od@@ line you see the children and grand@@ children here .
"T@@ wo of his wi@@ ves were brought to him su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing from in@@ fer@@ ti@@ lity and he cu@@ red them , three for evi@@ l spi@@ ri@@ ts , one for an as@@ th@@ m@@ atic con@@ di@@ tion and se@@ v@@ ere ch@@ est pa@@ in and two wi@@ ves O@@ n@@ di@@ j@@ o c@@ la@@ im@@ s he took for love , pa@@ ying their fam@@ il@@ ies a tot@@ al of 16 c@@ ow@@ s ."
One wi@@ fe des@@ er@@ ted him and another pas@@ sed away during tre@@ at@@ ment for evi@@ l spi@@ ri@@ ts .

You may noti@@ ce in se@@ ver@@ al of the ch@@ ap@@ ters that I photograph@@ ed there are em@@ p@@ ty por@@ tra@@ its .
"These em@@ p@@ ty por@@ tra@@ its re@@ present individu@@ als , living individu@@ als , who couldn &apos;t be present ."

"They inclu@@ de den@@ gu@@ e fe@@ ver , im@@ pri@@ son@@ ment , ar@@ my ser@@ vice , women not allow@@ ed to be photograph@@ ed for religi@@ ous and cul@@ tu@@ ral reas@@ ons ."
"And in this particular ch@@ ap@@ ter , it &apos;s children wh@@ ose mo@@ thers wouldn &apos;t al@@ low them to tra@@ vel to the photogra@@ phi@@ c sho@@ ot for fe@@ ar that their fa@@ thers would ki@@ d@@ na@@ p them during it ."
"T@@ wen@@ ty@@ -@@ four Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an ra@@ b@@ bi@@ ts were brought to Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a in 1@@ 8@@ 5@@ 9 by a Bri@@ ti@@ sh se@@ t@@ t@@ ler for spor@@ ting pur@@ pos@@ es , for hun@@ ting ."
"And within a hundre@@ d years , that popul@@ ation of 2@@ 4 had ex@@ plo@@ ded to half a billion ."

"A@@ ga@@ in , talking about f@@ ate , I was interested in the stories and f@@ ate of particular works of art ."
These pain@@ t@@ ings were taken by H@@ ans Fran@@ k during the time of the Th@@ ird Re@@ ich .

"They are Le@@ on@@ ar@@ do da V@@ in@@ ci &apos;s &quot; &quot; L@@ ady Wi@@ th an E@@ r@@ m@@ ine , &quot; &quot; R@@ em@@ bran@@ d@@ t &apos;s &quot; &quot; L@@ and@@ s@@ cape Wi@@ th Go@@ od S@@ am@@ ar@@ it@@ an &quot; &quot; and R@@ ap@@ ha@@ el &apos;s &quot; &quot; P@@ or@@ tra@@ it of a Y@@ outh , &quot; &quot; which has never been found ."
"C@@ ha@@ p@@ ter 12 high@@ li@@ ghts people being born into a bat@@ tle that is not of their making , but be@@ comes their own ."
So this is the F@@ er@@ raz family and the N@@ o@@ v@@ a@@ es family .
And they are in an ac@@ tive blo@@ od fe@@ u@@ d .
"This fe@@ u@@ d has been going on since 199@@ 1 in Nor@@ the@@ ast B@@ raz@@ il in P@@ er@@ na@@ m@@ bu@@ co , and it inv@@ olved the de@@ a@@ ths of 20 mem@@ bers of the fam@@ il@@ ies and 40 others as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with the fe@@ u@@ d , inclu@@ ding hi@@ red h@@ it men , in@@ no@@ cent by@@ stan@@ ders and friends ."
T@@ en@@ sions between these two fam@@ il@@ ies d@@ ate back to 19@@ 1@@ 3 when there was a disp@@ u@@ te over local poli@@ tical power .

"In a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ mon@@ th per@@ i@@ od when I was at the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age , only one child had been ad@@ op@@ ted ."
"Ch@@ il@@ dren have to leave the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age at age 16 , des@@ pi@@ te the fact that there &apos;s often now@@ here for them to go ."
"It &apos;s com@@ mon@@ ly re@@ por@@ ted in U@@ kra@@ ine that children , when lea@@ ving the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age are tar@@ ge@@ ted for human traf@@ fi@@ c@@ king , child por@@ no@@ gra@@ ph@@ y and pro@@ stitu@@ tion ."
"M@@ any have to turn to cri@@ min@@ al acti@@ vity for their survi@@ v@@ al , and high r@@ ates of su@@ i@@ ci@@ de are recor@@ ded ."
This is a bo@@ ys &apos; be@@ dro@@ om .
There &apos;s an in@@ su@@ f@@ fi@@ cient su@@ pp@@ ly of be@@ ds at the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age and not enough war@@ m clo@@ thing .
Ch@@ il@@ dren ba@@ the in@@ fre@@ qu@@ ently because the ho@@ t water isn &apos;t turned on until O@@ c@@ to@@ ber .

I have spent the last years trying to re@@ sol@@ ve two eni@@ g@@ m@@ as : Why is produ@@ cti@@ vity so disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting in all the comp@@ an@@ ies where I work ?
I have worked with more than 500 comp@@ an@@ ies .
"D@@ es@@ pi@@ te all the technologi@@ cal adv@@ an@@ ces — compu@@ ters , I@@ .@@ T@@ . , communi@@ c@@ ations , tele@@ communi@@ c@@ ations , the Inter@@ net ."
E@@ ni@@ g@@ ma number two : Why is there so little eng@@ ag@@ ement at work ?
"Wh@@ y do people feel so mi@@ ser@@ able , even acti@@ vely di@@ sen@@ g@@ aged ?"
D@@ is@@ eng@@ ag@@ ing their colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es .
"D@@ es@@ pi@@ te all the af@@ fi@@ li@@ ation ev@@ ents , the ce@@ le@@ br@@ ation , the people ini@@ ti@@ ati@@ ves , the le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship develo@@ pment progra@@ ms to tra@@ in man@@ ag@@ ers on how to better moti@@ v@@ ate their te@@ am@@ s ."
"A@@ t the beginning , I thought there was a chi@@ ck@@ en and e@@ g@@ g issue : Because people are less eng@@ aged , they are less produ@@ ctive ."
"O@@ r vice ver@@ sa , because they are less produ@@ ctive , we put more pres@@ sure and they are less eng@@ aged ."
"But as we were doing our an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s we realized that there was a common ro@@ ot cause to these two issu@@ es that re@@ lat@@ es , in fact , to the basi@@ c pi@@ l@@ lars of man@@ ag@@ ement ."
The way we organi@@ ze is based on two pi@@ l@@ lars .
"The hard — structure , pro@@ cess@@ es , systems ."
"The so@@ ft — feel@@ ings , sen@@ ti@@ ments , inter@@ per@@ s@@ onal relation@@ ships , tra@@ its , per@@ son@@ ality ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever a company re@@ organiz@@ es , re@@ stru@@ ctures , re@@ engine@@ ers , goes through a cul@@ tu@@ ral trans@@ form@@ ation program , it cho@@ os@@ es these two pi@@ l@@ lars ."
"Now , we try to ref@@ ine them , we try to com@@ b@@ ine them ."
The real issue is — and this is the answer to the two eni@@ g@@ m@@ as — these pi@@ l@@ lars are ob@@ so@@ le@@ te .
They are ob@@ so@@ le@@ te .
How do they work when you try to use these appro@@ ach@@ es in front of the new comple@@ x@@ ity of business ?
"The hard appro@@ ach , basically is that you start from strate@@ gy , requi@@ re@@ ments , stru@@ ctures , pro@@ cess@@ es , systems , K@@ P@@ Is , s@@ co@@ re@@ car@@ ds , com@@ mi@@ t@@ te@@ es , he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters , hu@@ b@@ s , clu@@ st@@ ers , you name it ."
"I for@@ got all the me@@ tri@@ cs , in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves , com@@ mi@@ t@@ te@@ es , mi@@ ddle offi@@ ces and inter@@ fac@@ es ."
"What happens basically on the left , you have more comple@@ x@@ ity , the new comple@@ x@@ ity of business ."
"We need qu@@ ality , cost , reli@@ ability , speed ."
"And every time there is a new requi@@ re@@ ment , we use the same appro@@ ach ."
"We create de@@ di@@ c@@ ated structure pro@@ cess@@ ed systems , basically to deal with the new comple@@ x@@ ity of business ."
The hard appro@@ ach cre@@ ates just comp@@ lic@@ at@@ ed@@ ness in the organiz@@ ation .
Let &apos;s take an example .
"A@@ n au@@ tom@@ oti@@ ve company , the engine@@ ering di@@ vision is a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal mat@@ ri@@ x ."
"If you open any cell of the mat@@ ri@@ x , you find another 20@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal mat@@ ri@@ x ."
"You have M@@ r. N@@ o@@ ise , M@@ r. Pe@@ tro@@ l Con@@ sum@@ ption , M@@ r. An@@ ti@@ -@@ Col@@ li@@ sion Pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"For any new requi@@ re@@ ment , you have a de@@ di@@ c@@ ated fun@@ ction in char@@ ge of ali@@ g@@ ning engine@@ ers against the new requi@@ re@@ ment ."
What happens when the new requi@@ re@@ ment em@@ er@@ ges ?
"S@@ ome years ago , a new requi@@ re@@ ment ap@@ pe@@ ared on the marke@@ t@@ place : the len@@ g@@ th of the war@@ ran@@ ty per@@ i@@ od ."
"So ther@@ e@@ fore the new requi@@ re@@ ment is re@@ pa@@ i@@ ra@@ bility , making cars e@@ asy to re@@ pa@@ ir ."
"So , what was the solution using the hard appro@@ ach ?"
"If re@@ pa@@ i@@ ra@@ bility is the new requi@@ re@@ ment , the solution is to create a new fun@@ ction , M@@ r. Re@@ pa@@ i@@ ra@@ bility ."
And M@@ r. Re@@ pa@@ i@@ ra@@ bility cre@@ ates the re@@ pa@@ i@@ ra@@ bility process .
"Wi@@ th a re@@ pa@@ i@@ ra@@ bility s@@ co@@ re@@ car@@ d , with a re@@ pa@@ i@@ ra@@ bility me@@ tri@@ c and ev@@ en@@ tually re@@ pa@@ i@@ ra@@ bility in@@ cen@@ tive ."
That came on top of 25 other K@@ P@@ Is .
What per@@ cent@@ age of these people is v@@ ari@@ able comp@@ en@@ s@@ ation ?
"T@@ wen@@ ty percent at most , di@@ vi@@ ded by 2@@ 6 K@@ P@@ Is , re@@ pa@@ i@@ ra@@ bility makes a difference of 0@@ .@@ 8 percent ."
"But what oc@@ cur@@ s for zer@@ o impac@@ t ? M@@ r. Re@@ pa@@ i@@ ra@@ bility , process , s@@ co@@ re@@ car@@ d , ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation , co@@ ordin@@ ation with the 25 other co@@ ordin@@ at@@ ors to have zer@@ o impac@@ t ."
"Now , in front of the new comple@@ x@@ ity of business , the only solution is not d@@ raw@@ ing bo@@ x@@ es with re@@ por@@ ting lin@@ es ."
It is basically the inter@@ play .
How the par@@ ts work together .
"The conne@@ ctions , the inter@@ ac@@ tions , the sy@@ na@@ p@@ ses ."
"It is not the sk@@ ele@@ ton of bo@@ x@@ es , it is the ner@@ v@@ ous system of ad@@ ap@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess and inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence ."
"You know , you could call it co@@ oper@@ ation , basically ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever people co@@ oper@@ ate , they use less re@@ sources . In everything ."
"You know , the re@@ pa@@ i@@ ra@@ bility issue is a co@@ oper@@ ation problem ."
"When you design cars , ple@@ ase take into ac@@ coun@@ t the needs of those who will re@@ pa@@ ir the cars in the after s@@ al@@ es gar@@ ages ."
"When we don &apos;t co@@ oper@@ ate we need more time , more e@@ qui@@ pment , more systems , more te@@ am@@ s ."
"We need — When pro@@ cu@@ re@@ ment , su@@ pp@@ ly cha@@ in , man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing don &apos;t co@@ oper@@ ate we need more sto@@ ck , more inv@@ ent@@ or@@ ies , more working ca@@ pi@@ tal ."
S@@ har@@ e@@ hol@@ ders ? C@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ ers ?
"No , they will ref@@ use ."
"So who is left ? The em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es , who have to comp@@ en@@ s@@ ate through their su@@ per individu@@ al ef@@ for@@ ts for the l@@ ack of co@@ oper@@ ation ."
"S@@ tre@@ ss , bur@@ n@@ out , they are over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents ."
No won@@ der they di@@ sen@@ g@@ age .
How do the hard and the so@@ ft try to f@@ ost@@ er co@@ oper@@ ation ?
"The hard : In ban@@ ks , when there is a problem between the back offi@@ ce and the front offi@@ ce , they don &apos;t co@@ oper@@ ate . What is the solution ?"
They create a mi@@ ddle offi@@ ce .
What happens one year later ?
P@@ lu@@ s I have to pay for the mi@@ ddle offi@@ ce .
The hard appro@@ ach is u@@ na@@ ble to f@@ ost@@ er co@@ oper@@ ation .
"It can only ad@@ d new bo@@ x@@ es , new b@@ ones in the sk@@ ele@@ ton ."
"The so@@ ft appro@@ ach : To make people co@@ oper@@ ate , we need to make them like each other ."
"I@@ m@@ pro@@ ve inter@@ per@@ s@@ onal feel@@ ings , the more people like each other , the more they will co@@ oper@@ ate ."
It is tot@@ ally wrong .
It is even coun@@ ter@@ produ@@ ctive .
"L@@ ook , at home I have two T@@ V@@ s . Why ?"
P@@ re@@ ci@@ se@@ ly not to have to co@@ oper@@ ate with my wi@@ fe .
( Laughter ) N@@ ot to have to im@@ pos@@ e tra@@ de@@ of@@ f@@ s to my wi@@ fe .
And why I try not to im@@ pos@@ e tra@@ de@@ of@@ f@@ s to my wi@@ fe is pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly because I love my wi@@ fe .
"If I didn &apos;t love my wi@@ fe , one T@@ V would be enough : You will wat@@ ch my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te fo@@ ot@@ ball g@@ ame , if you are not happy , how is the book or the door ?"
And we go for a second T@@ V or we es@@ cal@@ ate the deci@@ sion ab@@ o@@ ve for ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ation .
"D@@ e@@ fini@@ tely , these appro@@ ach@@ es are ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ."
"To deal with comple@@ x@@ ity , to en@@ h@@ ance the ner@@ v@@ ous system , we have created what we call the s@@ mar@@ t sim@@ pli@@ city appro@@ ach based on simple ru@@ les ."
S@@ im@@ ple ru@@ le number one : U@@ n@@ der@@ stand what others do .
What is their real work ?
"We need to go be@@ y@@ ond the bo@@ x@@ es , the job descri@@ p@@ tions , be@@ y@@ ond the surface of the con@@ tain@@ er , to understand the real cont@@ ent ."
"M@@ e , desig@@ ner , if I put a wi@@ re here , I know that it will mean that we will have to re@@ move the eng@@ ine to ac@@ cess the li@@ ghts ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , you need to re@@ en@@ force inte@@ gr@@ at@@ ors ."
"In@@ te@@ gr@@ at@@ ors are not mi@@ ddle offi@@ ces , they are man@@ ag@@ ers , ex@@ ist@@ ing man@@ ag@@ ers that you re@@ in@@ force so that they have power and inter@@ est to make others co@@ oper@@ ate ."
How can you re@@ in@@ force your man@@ ag@@ ers as inte@@ gr@@ at@@ ors ?
B@@ y re@@ moving la@@ y@@ ers .
"They don &apos;t understand re@@ ality and they ad@@ d the comp@@ lic@@ at@@ ed@@ ness of me@@ tri@@ cs , K@@ P@@ Is ."
"B@@ y re@@ moving ru@@ les — the bi@@ g@@ ger we are , the more we need inte@@ gr@@ at@@ ors , ther@@ e@@ fore the less ru@@ les we must have , to give di@@ scre@@ tion@@ ary power to man@@ ag@@ ers ."
"And we do the op@@ posi@@ te — the bi@@ g@@ ger we are , the more ru@@ les we create ."
And we end up with the En@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ a Bri@@ tan@@ ni@@ ca of ru@@ les .
"You need to incre@@ ase the qu@@ ani@@ ti@@ ty of power so that you can em@@ power everybody to use their ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment , their inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence ."
"You must give more car@@ ds to people so that they have the cri@@ tical mas@@ s of car@@ ds to take the ri@@ sk to co@@ oper@@ ate , to move out of in@@ sul@@ ation ."
"O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , they will with@@ dra@@ w . They will di@@ sen@@ g@@ age ."
"These ru@@ les , they come from g@@ ame the@@ ory and organiz@@ ational so@@ ci@@ o@@ logy ."
You can incre@@ ase the sha@@ do@@ w of the future .
C@@ re@@ ate fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op@@ s that ex@@ pos@@ e people to the con@@ sequ@@ ences of their ac@@ tions .
This is what the au@@ tom@@ oti@@ ve company did when they saw that M@@ r. Re@@ pa@@ i@@ ra@@ bility had no impac@@ t .
"They said to the design engine@@ ers : Now , in three years , when the new car is la@@ un@@ ched on the market , you will move to the after s@@ al@@ es network , and become in char@@ ge of the war@@ ran@@ ty bud@@ get , and if the war@@ ran@@ ty bud@@ get ex@@ plo@@ des , it will ex@@ plo@@ de in your face . ( Laughter ) Mu@@ ch more powerful than 0@@ .@@ 8 percent v@@ ari@@ able comp@@ en@@ s@@ ation ."
"You need also to incre@@ ase re@@ ci@@ pro@@ city , by re@@ moving the bu@@ f@@ f@@ ers that make us self-@@ su@@ f@@ fi@@ cient ."
"When you re@@ move these bu@@ f@@ f@@ ers , you h@@ old me by the no@@ se , I h@@ old you by the e@@ ar ."
We will co@@ oper@@ ate .
Re@@ move the second T@@ V .
"There are many second T@@ V@@ s at work that don &apos;t create val@@ ue , they just provi@@ de dy@@ s@@ fun@@ cti@@ onal self-@@ su@@ f@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy ."
You need to re@@ ward those who co@@ oper@@ ate and bl@@ ame those who don &apos;t co@@ oper@@ ate .
"He says , bl@@ ame is not for fai@@ lu@@ re , it is for fa@@ il@@ ing to help or ask for help ."
It chang@@ es everything .
"S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly it be@@ comes in my inter@@ est to be tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent on my real we@@ ak@@ n@@ ess@@ es , my real fore@@ c@@ ast , because I know I will not be bl@@ am@@ ed if I fa@@ il , but if I fa@@ il to help or ask for help ."
"When you do this , it has a lot of im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations on organiz@@ ational design ."
"You stop d@@ raw@@ ing bo@@ x@@ es , dot@@ ted lin@@ es , full lin@@ es ; you look at their inter@@ play ."
It has a lot of im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations on fin@@ an@@ cial poli@@ cies that we use .
O@@ n human re@@ source man@@ ag@@ ement prac@@ ti@@ ces .
"When you do that , you can man@@ age comple@@ x@@ ity , the new comple@@ x@@ ity of business , without getting comp@@ lic@@ ated ."
You create more val@@ ue with low@@ er cost .
The real bat@@ tle is not against compe@@ ti@@ t@@ ors .
"This is ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh , very ab@@ strac@@ t ."
When do we me@@ et compe@@ ti@@ t@@ ors to fi@@ ght them ?
"The real bat@@ tle is against ourselves , against our bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ rac@@ y , our comp@@ lic@@ at@@ ed@@ ness ."
"O@@ n@@ ly you can fi@@ ght , can do it ."
Thank you .

"I gre@@ w up in New York C@@ ity , between H@@ ar@@ lem and the B@@ ron@@ x ."
"G@@ row@@ ing up as a bo@@ y , we were t@@ au@@ ght that men had to be t@@ ough , had to be stron@@ g , had to be cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous , dom@@ in@@ ating — no pa@@ in , no emoti@@ ons , with the ex@@ cep@@ tion of ang@@ er — and defini@@ tely no fe@@ ar ; that men are in char@@ ge , which means women are not ; that men le@@ ad , and you should just fol@@ low and do what we say ; that men are super@@ i@@ or ; women are in@@ fer@@ i@@ or ; that men are stron@@ g ; women are we@@ ak ; that women are of less val@@ ue , pro@@ per@@ ty of men , and obje@@ cts , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly se@@ x@@ u@@ al obje@@ cts ."
"I &apos;ve later come to know that to be the colle@@ ctive so@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ation of men , better known as the &quot; &quot; man box . &quot; &quot; Se@@ e this man box has in it all the in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ ts of how we def@@ ine what it means to be a man ."
"Now I also want to say , without a d@@ ou@@ b@@ t , there are some wonderful , wonderful , absolu@@ tely wonderful things about being a man ."
"But at the same time , there &apos;s some stuff that &apos;s just stra@@ ight up t@@ wi@@ st@@ ed , and we really need to beg@@ in to challen@@ ge , look at it and really get in the process of de@@ con@@ stru@@ cting , re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing , what we come to know as man@@ ho@@ od ."
"This is my two at home , Ken@@ d@@ all and J@@ ay ."
They &apos;re 11 and 12 .
Ken@@ d@@ all &apos;s 15 months ol@@ der than J@@ ay .
"There was a per@@ i@@ od of time when my wi@@ fe — her name is T@@ am@@ mie — and I , we just got real bus@@ y and whi@@ p , b@@ am , bo@@ om : Ken@@ d@@ all and J@@ ay ."
"( Laughter ) And when they were about five and six , four and five , J@@ ay could come to me , come to me c@@ ry@@ ing ."
"It didn &apos;t matter what she was c@@ ry@@ ing about , she could get on my k@@ ne@@ e , she could s@@ not my sle@@ e@@ ve up , just c@@ ry , c@@ ry it out ."
D@@ ad@@ dy &apos;s got you . That &apos;s all that &apos;s important .
"Now Ken@@ d@@ all on the other hand — and like I said , he &apos;s only 15 months ol@@ der than her — he &apos;d come to me c@@ ry@@ ing , it &apos;s like as so@@ on as I would hear him c@@ ry , a clo@@ ck would go off ."
"I would give the bo@@ y probably about 30 secon@@ ds , which means , by the time he got to me , I was already saying things like , &quot; &quot; Why are you c@@ ry@@ ing ?"
H@@ old your head up . L@@ ook at me .
E@@ x@@ pla@@ in to me what &apos;s wrong .
T@@ ell me what &apos;s wrong . I can &apos;t understand you .
"Wh@@ y are you c@@ ry@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; And out of my own f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation of my ro@@ le and respon@@ si@@ bility of building him up as a man to f@@ it into these gu@@ ide@@ lin@@ es and these stru@@ ctures that are de@@ fin@@ ing this man box , I would find myself saying things like , &quot; &quot; J@@ ust go in your room ."
"J@@ ust go on , go on in your room ."
"S@@ it down , get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a — &quot; &quot; what ?"
( A@@ ud@@ ience : M@@ an . ) Li@@ ke a man .
And he &apos;s five years old .
"And as I gro@@ w in life , I would say to myself , &quot; &quot; My God , what &apos;s wrong with me ?"
What am I doing ? Why would I do this ? &quot; &quot; And I think back .
I think back to my father .
There was a time in my life where we had a very t@@ rou@@ b@@ led experience in our family .
"My bro@@ ther , H@@ en@@ ry , he d@@ ied tra@@ gi@@ cally when we were te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"We li@@ ved in New York C@@ ity , as I said ."
"We li@@ ved in the B@@ ron@@ x at the time , and the bu@@ ri@@ al was in a place called L@@ ong Is@@ land , it was about two hours outside of the city ."
"And as we were pre@@ par@@ ing to come back from the bu@@ ri@@ al , the cars stop@@ ped at the ba@@ th@@ room to let fol@@ ks take care of themselves before the long ri@@ de back to the city ."
And the lim@@ ous@@ ine em@@ p@@ ties out .
"My mother , my si@@ ster , my a@@ un@@ t@@ ie , they all get out , but my father and I sta@@ yed in the lim@@ ous@@ ine , and no so@@ on@@ er than the women got out , he bur@@ st out c@@ ry@@ ing ."
"He didn &apos;t want c@@ ry in front of me , but he knew he wasn &apos;t going to make it back to the city , and it was better me than to al@@ low hi@@ m@@ self to ex@@ pre@@ ss these feel@@ ings and emoti@@ ons in front of the women ."
"And this is a man who , 10 minutes ago , had just put his te@@ en@@ age son in the ground — something I just can &apos;t even imagine ."
"The thing that sti@@ cks with me the most is that he was apo@@ logi@@ z@@ ing to me for c@@ ry@@ ing in front of me , and at the same time , he was also gi@@ ving me pro@@ ps , li@@ f@@ ting me up , for not c@@ ry@@ ing ."
"I come to also look at this as this fe@@ ar that we have as men , this fe@@ ar that just has us par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , hol@@ ding us h@@ ost@@ age to this man box ."
"I can remember spe@@ aking to a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y , a fo@@ ot@@ ball pla@@ y@@ er , and I asked him , I said , &quot; &quot; How would you feel if , in front of all the pla@@ y@@ ers , your co@@ ach told you you were playing like a girl ? &quot; &quot; Now I expe@@ cted him to say something like , I &apos;d be sa@@ d ; I &apos;d be ma@@ d ; I &apos;d be ang@@ ry , or something like that ."
"No , the bo@@ y said to me — the bo@@ y said to me , &quot; It would de@@ stro@@ y me . &quot;"
"And I said to myself , &quot; &quot; God , if it would de@@ stro@@ y him to be called a girl , what are we then teach@@ ing him about girls ? &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) It took me back to a time when I was about 12 years old ."
I gre@@ w up in ten@@ ement buil@@ dings in the in@@ ner city .
"A@@ t this time we &apos;re living in the B@@ ron@@ x , and in the building next to where I li@@ ved there was a guy na@@ med Joh@@ n@@ ny ."
"He was about 16 years old , and we were all about 12 years old — youn@@ ger guys ."
And he was h@@ ang@@ ing out with all us youn@@ ger guys .
"And this guy , he was up to a lot of no good ."
"He was the kind of kid who parents would have to won@@ der , &quot; What is this 1@@ 6@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y doing with these 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ ys ? &quot;"
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good .
He was a t@@ rou@@ b@@ led kid .
H@@ is mother had d@@ ied from a her@@ o@@ in over@@ do@@ se .
He was being ra@@ is@@ ed by his grand@@ mother .
H@@ is father wasn &apos;t on the set .
H@@ is grand@@ mother had two j@@ ob@@ s .
He was home alone a lot .
"But I &apos;ve got to tell you , we young guys , we looked up to this du@@ de , man ."
He was cool . He was f@@ ine .
"That &apos;s what the si@@ st@@ ers said , &quot; &quot; He was f@@ ine . &quot; &quot; He was having se@@ x ."
We all looked up to him .
"So one day , I &apos;m out in front of the house doing something — just playing around , doing something — I don &apos;t know what ."
"He looks out his win@@ do@@ w ; he cal@@ ls me up@@ sta@@ ir@@ s ; he said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey An@@ th@@ ony . &quot; &quot; They called me An@@ th@@ ony grow@@ ing up as a kid ."
"&quot; H@@ ey An@@ th@@ ony , come on up@@ sta@@ ir@@ s . &quot;"
"J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ ny call , you go ."
So I run right up@@ sta@@ ir@@ s .
"As he open@@ s the door , he says to me , &quot; &quot; Do you want some ? &quot; &quot; Now I im@@ medi@@ ately knew what he me@@ ant ."
"Because for me grow@@ ing up at that time , and our relation@@ ship with this man box , &quot; &quot; Do you want some ? &quot; &quot; me@@ ant one of two things : se@@ x or dru@@ gs — and we wer@@ en &apos;t doing dru@@ gs ."
"Now my box , my car@@ d , my man box car@@ d , was im@@ medi@@ ately in je@@ opar@@ dy ."
"T@@ wo things : One , I never had se@@ x ."
We don &apos;t talk about that as men .
"You only tell your de@@ ar@@ est , clo@@ s@@ est friend , s@@ wor@@ n to se@@ cre@@ cy for life , the first time you had se@@ x ."
"For everybody else , we go around like we &apos;ve been having se@@ x since we were two ."
There a@@ in &apos;t no first time .
( Laughter ) The other thing I couldn &apos;t tell him is that I didn &apos;t want any .
That &apos;s even wor@@ se . We &apos;re sup@@ posed to always be on the pro@@ w@@ l .
"W@@ om@@ en are obje@@ cts , es@@ pe@@ cially se@@ x@@ u@@ al obje@@ cts ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , so I couldn &apos;t tell him any of that ."
"So , like my mother would say , make a long story shor@@ t , I just simply said to Joh@@ n@@ ny , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; He told me to go in his room ."
I go in his room . O@@ n his bed is a girl from the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od na@@ med S@@ he@@ il@@ a .
She &apos;s 16 years old .
She &apos;s nu@@ de .
"S@@ he &apos;s what I know today to be ment@@ ally i@@ ll , high@@ er@@ -@@ fun@@ cti@@ on@@ ing at times than others ."
We had a whole cho@@ ice of in@@ appro@@ pri@@ ate na@@ mes for her .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , Joh@@ n@@ ny had just got@@ ten through having se@@ x with her ."
"Well actually , he ra@@ ped her , but he would say he had se@@ x with her ."
"Because , while S@@ he@@ il@@ a never said no , she also never said y@@ es ."
So he was of@@ fer@@ ing me the opportunity to do the same .
"So when I go in the room , I close the door ."
"F@@ ol@@ ks , I &apos;m pe@@ tri@@ f@@ ied ."
"I stand with my back to the door so Joh@@ n@@ ny can &apos;t b@@ ust in the room and see that I &apos;m not doing anything , and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something ."
So now I &apos;m no longer trying to figure out what I &apos;m going to do ; I &apos;m trying to figure out how I &apos;m going to get out of this room .
"So in my 12 years of wi@@ s@@ dom , I zi@@ p my pan@@ ts down , I walk out into the room , and l@@ o and be@@ h@@ old to me , while I was in the room with S@@ he@@ il@@ a , Joh@@ n@@ ny was back at the win@@ do@@ w cal@@ ling guys up ."
So now there &apos;s a living room full of guys .
It was like the wai@@ ting room in the do@@ ctor &apos;s offi@@ ce .
"And they asked me how was it , and I say to them , &quot; &quot; It was good , &quot; &quot; and I zi@@ p my pan@@ ts up in front of them , and I head for the door ."
"Now I say this all with re@@ mor@@ se , and I was feeling a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous amount of re@@ mor@@ se at that time , but I was con@@ fli@@ cted , because , while I was feeling re@@ mor@@ se , I was exci@@ ted , because I didn &apos;t get ca@@ u@@ ght ."
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening .
"This fe@@ ar , getting outside the man box , tot@@ ally en@@ velo@@ ped me ."
"It was way more important to me , about me and my man box car@@ d than about S@@ he@@ il@@ a and what was happening to her ."
"S@@ e@@ e colle@@ cti@@ vely , we as men are t@@ au@@ ght to have less val@@ ue in women , to view them as pro@@ per@@ ty and the obje@@ cts of men ."
We see that as an equ@@ ation that equ@@ als violence against women .
"We as men , good men , the large maj@@ ori@@ ty of men , we oper@@ ate on the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of this whole colle@@ ctive so@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ation ."
"We kind of see ourselves se@@ par@@ ate , but we &apos;re very much a part of it ."
"You see , we have to come to understand that less val@@ ue , pro@@ per@@ ty and obje@@ cti@@ fi@@ cation is the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation and the violence can &apos;t happen without it ."
So we &apos;re very much a part of the solution as well as the problem .
"The cen@@ ter for dise@@ ase control says that men &apos;s violence against women is at epi@@ demi@@ c pro@@ por@@ tions , is the number one health con@@ cer@@ n for women in this country and ab@@ ro@@ ad ."
"So quickly , I &apos;d like to just say , this is the love of my life , my d@@ aughter J@@ ay ."
The world I en@@ vision for her — how do I want men to be ac@@ ting and be@@ having ?
I need you on bo@@ ard . I need you with me .
"I need you working with me and me working with you on how we ra@@ ise our s@@ ons and te@@ ach them to be men — that it &apos;s o@@ kay to not be dom@@ in@@ ating , that it &apos;s o@@ kay to have feel@@ ings and emoti@@ ons , that it &apos;s o@@ kay to pro@@ mot@@ e equ@@ ality , that it &apos;s o@@ kay to have women who are just friends and that &apos;s it , that it &apos;s o@@ kay to be whole , that my li@@ ber@@ ation as a man is t@@ ied to your li@@ ber@@ ation as a woman . ( Applause ) I remember as@@ king a n@@ in@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y , I asked a n@@ in@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y , &quot; &quot; What would life be like for you , if you didn &apos;t have to ad@@ here to this man box ? &quot; &quot;"
"He said to me , &quot; &quot; I would be f@@ ree . &quot; &quot; Thank you fol@@ ks ."
( Applause )
"H@@ ow , maybe , is it possible to use the Inter@@ net to create a new form of cin@@ em@@ a ?"

"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to n@@ on-@@ govern@@ ment@@ al organiz@@ ations that keep such st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs , since 19@@ 4@@ 5 , in Europ@@ e and the Ameri@@ c@@ as , there has been a ste@@ ep dec@@ line in inter@@ state war@@ s , in de@@ ad@@ ly e@@ th@@ nic ri@@ ots or po@@ gro@@ ms , and in mi@@ lit@@ ary cou@@ ps , even in S@@ outh America .

"And , as you can see , the death r@@ ate goes down from 6@@ 5@@ ,000 de@@ a@@ ths per con@@ fli@@ ct per year in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s to less than 2@@ ,000 de@@ a@@ ths per con@@ fli@@ ct per year in this dec@@ ade , as hor@@ ri@@ fic as it is ."
"E@@ ven in the year scale , one can see a dec@@ line of violence ."
"S@@ in@@ ce the end of the C@@ old W@@ ar , there have been fe@@ wer ci@@ vi@@ l war@@ s , fe@@ wer gen@@ o@@ ci@@ des — in@@ de@@ ed , a 90 percent redu@@ ction since post@@ -@@ World W@@ ar I@@ I high@@ s — and even a re@@ vers@@ al of the 19@@ 6@@ 0s up@@ ti@@ ck in h@@ omi@@ ci@@ de and viol@@ ent cri@@ me ."

"P@@ resi@@ dent C@@ lin@@ ton , if you &apos;re here , th@@ ank you ."
"( Laughter ) So the question is , why are so many people so wrong about something so important ? I think there are a number of reas@@ ons ."

"And of course , our change in stan@@ dar@@ ds can out@@ p@@ ace the change in behavi@@ or . One of the reas@@ ons violence went down is that people got si@@ ck of the car@@ na@@ ge and c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty in their time ."
"That &apos;s a process that seem@@ s to be contin@@ u@@ ing , but if it out@@ stri@@ ps behavi@@ or by the stan@@ dar@@ ds of the day , things always look more bar@@ bar@@ ic than they would have been by histor@@ ic stan@@ dar@@ ds .

In a state of an@@ ar@@ chy , there &apos;s a con@@ st@@ ant tem@@ p@@ tation to inv@@ ade your neigh@@ b@@ ors pre@@ em@@ p@@ ti@@ vely , before they inv@@ ade you . M@@ ore re@@ cent@@ ly , Th@@ om@@ as S@@ ch@@ el@@ ling gi@@ ves the an@@ al@@ og@@ y of a h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner who hear@@ s a ru@@ st@@ lin@@ g@@ "
"@@ in the bas@@ ement . Be@@ ing a good American , he has a pi@@ sto@@ l in the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ stand , pul@@ ls out his gu@@ n , and wal@@ ks down the sta@@ ir@@ s ."
And what does he see but a bur@@ gl@@ ar with a gu@@ n in his hand .
"Now , each one of them is thinking , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t really want to ki@@ ll that guy , but he &apos;s about to ki@@ ll me ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe I had better sho@@ ot him , before he sho@@ ots me , es@@ pe@@ cially since , even if he doesn &apos;t want to ki@@ ll me , he &apos;s probably wor@@ ry@@ ing right now that I might ki@@ ll him before he kil@@ ls me . &quot; &quot; And so on ."
"H@@ un@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ er pe@@ op@@ les ex@@ pli@@ ci@@ tly go through this tra@@ in of thought , and will often ra@@ id their neigh@@ b@@ ors out of fe@@ ar of being ra@@ i@@ ded first ."
"Now , one way of de@@ al@@ ing with this problem is by de@@ ter@@ r@@ ence ."
"You don &apos;t stri@@ ke first , but you have a publi@@ c@@ ly an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced poli@@ cy that you will re@@ t@@ ali@@ ate sa@@ v@@ ag@@ ely if you are inv@@ ad@@ ed ."
"The only thing is that it &apos;s li@@ able to having its blu@@ ff called , and ther@@ e@@ fore can only work if it &apos;s cre@@ di@@ ble . To make it cre@@ di@@ ble , you must av@@ en@@ ge all in@@ sul@@ ts and se@@ t@@ tle all s@@ co@@ res , which le@@ ads to the cy@@ cles of blo@@ ody ven@@ de@@ t@@ ta ."
"L@@ i@@ fe be@@ comes an e@@ pis@@ od@@ e of &quot; &quot; The S@@ op@@ ran@@ os . &quot; &quot; H@@ ob@@ be@@ s &apos; solution , the &quot; &quot; Le@@ vi@@ a@@ than , &quot; &quot; was that if au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty for the le@@ gi@@ ti@@ m@@ ate use of violence was v@@ est@@ ed in a single de@@ moc@@ r@@ atic ag@@ en@@ cy — a le@@ vi@@ a@@ than — then such a state can redu@@ ce the tem@@ p@@ tation of att@@ ack , because any kind of ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sion will be pu@@ ni@@ shed , lea@@ ving its pro@@ fi@@ t@@ ability as zer@@ o . That would re@@ move the tem@@ p@@ tation to inv@@ ade pre@@ em@@ p@@ ti@@ vely , out of fe@@ ar of them att@@ ac@@ king you first ."
"It re@@ mo@@ ves the need for a ha@@ ir tri@@ g@@ ger for re@@ t@@ ali@@ ation to make your de@@ ter@@ r@@ ent thre@@ at cre@@ di@@ ble .

E@@ is@@ ner — the man who pl@@ ot@@ ted the h@@ omi@@ ci@@ de r@@ ates that you fai@@ led to see in the ear@@ lie@@ r sli@@ de — ar@@ gu@@ ed that the ti@@ ming of the dec@@ line of h@@ omi@@ ci@@ de in Europ@@ e co@@ in@@ ci@@ ded with the ri@@ se of cen@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed st@@ ates ."
So that &apos;s a bit of a sup@@ port for the le@@ vi@@ a@@ than the@@ ory .
"A@@ l@@ so sup@@ por@@ ting it is the fact that we today see er@@ up@@ tions of violence in z@@ ones of an@@ ar@@ chy , in fai@@ led st@@ ates , col@@ lap@@ sed em@@ pi@@ res , fron@@ t@@ ier regi@@ ons , ma@@ fi@@ as , stre@@ et g@@ an@@ gs and so on ."
"The second ex@@ plan@@ ation is that in many times and places , there is a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad sen@@ ti@@ ment that life is che@@ a@@ p ."
"In ear@@ lie@@ r times , when su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing and early death were common in one &apos;s own life , one has fe@@ wer comp@@ un@@ ctions about in@@ f@@ lic@@ ting them on others . And as technology and economic ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy make life longer and more ple@@ as@@ ant , one pu@@ ts a high@@ er val@@ ue on life in gener@@ al ."
This was an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent from the poli@@ tical scienti@@ st J@@ am@@ es P@@ a@@ y@@ ne .
"A third ex@@ plan@@ ation inv@@ ok@@ es the con@@ cept of a n@@ on@@ zer@@ o@@ -@@ su@@ m g@@ ame , and was worked out in the book &quot; &quot; N@@ on@@ zer@@ o &quot; &quot; by the jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st Rob@@ er@@ t W@@ right . W@@ right poin@@ ts out that in certain cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces , co@@ oper@@ ation or n@@ on-@@ violence can b@@ en@@ ef@@ it both par@@ ties in an inter@@ action , such as ga@@ ins in tra@@ de when two par@@ ties tra@@ de their sur@@ pl@@ uses and both come out a@@ head , or when two par@@ ties l@@ ay down their ar@@ ms and sp@@ li@@ t the so@@ -@@ called pe@@ ace di@@ vi@@ d@@ end that resul@@ ts in them not having to fi@@ ght the whole time ."
"W@@ right ar@@ gu@@ es that technology has incre@@ as@@ ed the number of posi@@ ti@@ ve@@ -@@ su@@ m g@@ am@@ es that hum@@ ans ten@@ d to be em@@ bro@@ i@@ led in , by allow@@ ing the tra@@ de of go@@ ods , ser@@ vi@@ ces and ideas over longer di@@ stan@@ ces and am@@ ong lar@@ ger grou@@ ps of people ."
"The resul@@ t is that other people become more val@@ u@@ able ali@@ ve than de@@ ad , and violence dec@@ lin@@ es for sel@@ fish reas@@ ons . A@@ s W@@ right put it , &quot; &quot; A@@ mon@@ g the many reas@@ ons that I think that we should not b@@ om@@ b the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese is that they built my min@@ i@@ -@@ v@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The f@@ our@@ th ex@@ plan@@ ation is cap@@ tu@@ red in the ti@@ tle of a book called &quot; &quot; The E@@ x@@ pan@@ ding C@@ ir@@ cle , &quot; &quot; by the phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ her Pe@@ ter S@@ ing@@ er , who ar@@ gu@@ es that ev@@ olution be@@ qu@@ e@@ a@@ the@@ d hum@@ ans with a sense of em@@ pa@@ th@@ y , an ability to tre@@ at other pe@@ op@@ les &apos; interest@@ s as com@@ par@@ able to one &apos;s own . U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , by def@@ au@@ l@@ t we app@@ ly it only to a very nar@@ row cir@@ cle of friends and family ."
"P@@ e@@ ople outside that cir@@ cle are tre@@ ated as sub@@ -@@ human , and can be ex@@ plo@@ i@@ ted with im@@ pu@@ ni@@ ty . But , over history , the cir@@ cle has ex@@ pan@@ ded . One can see , in histori@@ cal recor@@ d , it ex@@ pan@@ ding from the vi@@ ll@@ age , to the cl@@ an , to the tri@@ be , to the n@@ ation , to other rac@@ es , to both se@@ x@@ es , and , in S@@ ing@@ er &apos;s own ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents , something that we should ex@@ ten@@ d to other s@@ ent@@ ien@@ t species . The question is , if this has happened , what has power@@ ed that ex@@ pan@@ sion ?"
"And there are a number of possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies , such as incre@@ as@@ ing cir@@ cles of re@@ ci@@ pro@@ city in the sense that Rob@@ er@@ t W@@ right ar@@ gu@@ es for ."
"The logi@@ c of the g@@ ol@@ den ru@@ le — the more you think about and inter@@ act with other people , the more you realize that it is un@@ ten@@ able to pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge your interest@@ s over the@@ ir@@ s , at least not if you want them to list@@ en to you . You can &apos;t say that my interest@@ s are spe@@ cial com@@ par@@ ed to y@@ ours , any@@ more than you can say that the particular spo@@ t that I &apos;m standing on is a uni@@ qu@@ e part of the universe because I happen to be standing on it that very minu@@ te ."
"It may also be power@@ ed by co@@ smo@@ po@@ lit@@ ani@@ sm , by histor@@ ies , and jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sm , and me@@ mo@@ ir@@ s , and reali@@ stic fi@@ ction , and tra@@ vel , and liter@@ acy , which allow@@ s you to project yourself into the lives of other people that form@@ er@@ ly you may have tre@@ ated as sub@@ -@@ human , and also to realize the ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ al cont@@ ing@@ en@@ cy of your own st@@ ation in life , the sense that &quot; &quot; there but for for@@ tu@@ ne go I@@ . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ atever its ca@@ uses , the dec@@ line of violence , I think , has pro@@ found im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations . It should force us to ask not just , why is there war ? But also , why is there pe@@ ace ? N@@ ot just , what are we doing wrong ? But also , what have we been doing right ?"
"Because we have been doing something right , and it sure would be good to find out what it is ."

"A@@ f@@ ter four years , I felt it was sa@@ fe enough to move to Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan per@@ man@@ ently , and I was working there as a do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ary photograph@@ er , and I worked on many stories ."
One of the most important stories that I did was the dan@@ cing bo@@ ys of Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan .
It is a tra@@ gi@@ c story about an app@@ al@@ ling tra@@ di@@ tion .
It inv@@ ol@@ ves young kids dan@@ cing for war@@ l@@ or@@ ds and powerful men in the society .
"These bo@@ ys are often ab@@ du@@ cted or b@@ ou@@ ght from their po@@ or parents , and they are put to work as se@@ x s@@ la@@ ves ."
This is S@@ hu@@ ku@@ r .
He was ki@@ d@@ na@@ pped from K@@ ab@@ u@@ l by a war@@ l@@ or@@ d .
"He was taken to another pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce , where he was for@@ ced to work as a se@@ x s@@ la@@ ve for the war@@ l@@ or@@ d and his friends ."

"A@@ long with my family , I re@@ turned back to Q@@ u@@ et@@ ta ."
The situ@@ ation in Q@@ u@@ et@@ ta had changed dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally since I left in 200@@ 5 .
"O@@ n@@ ce a pe@@ ace@@ ful ha@@ ven for the H@@ az@@ ar@@ as , it had now turned into the most d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous city in P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an ."
"H@@ az@@ ar@@ as are con@@ fin@@ ed into two small are@@ as , and they are mar@@ gin@@ aliz@@ ed so@@ cially , edu@@ c@@ ati@@ on@@ ally , and fin@@ an@@ cially ."
This is N@@ ad@@ ir .
I had known him since my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od .
He was in@@ ju@@ red when his v@@ an was am@@ bus@@ h@@ ed by ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sts in Q@@ u@@ et@@ ta .
He later d@@ ied of his in@@ j@@ ur@@ ies .
"A@@ round 1@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 H@@ az@@ ar@@ a mem@@ bers had been kil@@ led in v@@ ari@@ ous att@@ ac@@ ks , and around 3@@ ,000 of them were in@@ ju@@ red , and many of them per@@ man@@ ently dis@@ ab@@ led ."
"The att@@ ac@@ ks on the H@@ az@@ ar@@ a community would only get wor@@ se , so it was not sur@@ pri@@ sing that many wanted to f@@ le@@ e ."
"A@@ f@@ ter Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , I@@ ran , P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an , Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a is home to the f@@ our@@ th largest popul@@ ation of H@@ az@@ ar@@ as in the world ."
"When it came time to leave P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an , Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a seem@@ ed the obvi@@ ous cho@@ ice ."
"We all knew about the ri@@ sk@@ s , and how terri@@ f@@ ying the jour@@ ney is , and I met many people who lost lo@@ ved ones at se@@ a ."
"It was a des@@ per@@ ate deci@@ sion to take , to leave everything behind , and no one makes this deci@@ sion e@@ a@@ si@@ ly ."
"If I had been able to simply f@@ ly to Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , it would have taken me less than 2@@ 4 hours ."
But getting a vi@@ sa was im@@ possible .
"My jour@@ ney was much longer , much more comp@@ lic@@ ated , and cer@@ tain@@ ly more d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous , tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing to T@@ ha@@ il@@ and by air , and then by ro@@ ad and boat to M@@ al@@ a@@ ysi@@ a and into In@@ d@@ one@@ si@@ a , pa@@ ying people and s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers all the way and sp@@ ending a lot of time hi@@ ding and a lot of time in fe@@ ar of being ca@@ u@@ ght ."
"In In@@ d@@ one@@ si@@ a , I jo@@ ined a group of seven as@@ y@@ lu@@ m se@@ ek@@ ers ."
We all sh@@ ared a be@@ dro@@ om in a tow@@ n outside of Jak@@ ar@@ ta called B@@ og@@ or .
"A@@ f@@ ter sp@@ ending a week in B@@ og@@ or , three of my ro@@ om@@ mat@@ es left for the per@@ il@@ ous jour@@ ney , and we got the news two days later that a di@@ stre@@ s@@ sed boat s@@ ank in the se@@ a en rou@@ te to Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as Is@@ land ."
"We found out that our three ro@@ om@@ mat@@ es — N@@ aw@@ ro@@ z , J@@ af@@ far and S@@ ha@@ b@@ bi@@ r — were also am@@ ong those ."
O@@ n@@ ly J@@ af@@ far was re@@ s@@ cu@@ ed .
S@@ ha@@ b@@ bi@@ r and N@@ aw@@ ro@@ z were never seen again .
"It made me think , am I doing the right thing ?"
I con@@ clu@@ ded I really had no other cho@@ ice but to go on .
"A few weeks later , we got the call from the people s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler to al@@ er@@ t us that the boat is ready for us to comm@@ ence our se@@ a jour@@ ney ."
"T@@ ak@@ en in the night towar@@ ds the ma@@ in v@@ es@@ se@@ l on a mot@@ or@@ boat , we bo@@ ar@@ ded an old fi@@ sh@@ ing boat that was already over@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed ."
"There were 9@@ 3 of us , and we were all be@@ low de@@ ck ."
No one was allow@@ ed up on the top .

"It was like a scen@@ e from do@@ om@@ s@@ day , or maybe like one of those scen@@ es from those H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood mov@@ ies that shows that everything is bre@@ aking a@@ part and the world is just ending ."
It was happening to us for real .
We didn &apos;t have any hope .
O@@ ur boat was flo@@ ating like a mat@@ ch@@ box on the water without any control .
"The wa@@ ves were much high@@ er than our boat , and the water po@@ u@@ red in f@@ ast@@ er than the mot@@ or pu@@ m@@ ps could take it out ."
We all lost hope .
"We thought , this is the end ."
"We were wat@@ ching our de@@ a@@ ths , and I was do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ing it ."
"The cap@@ tain told us that we are not going to make it , we have to turn back the boat ."
We went on the de@@ ck and turned our tor@@ ch@@ es on and off to at@@ trac@@ t the at@@ ten@@ tion of any pas@@ sing boat .

"O@@ ur boat c@@ ra@@ sh@@ ing on@@ to the ro@@ cks , I sli@@ pped into the water and de@@ stro@@ yed my cam@@ era , whatever I had do@@ cu@@ men@@ ted ."
It was a thi@@ ck fore@@ st .
We all sp@@ li@@ t up into many grou@@ ps as we ar@@ gu@@ ed over what to do next .
We were all sc@@ ared and con@@ f@@ used .
"Th@@ en , after sp@@ ending the night on the be@@ ach , we found a je@@ t@@ ty and co@@ con@@ u@@ ts ."
"We ha@@ i@@ led a boat from a ne@@ ar@@ by re@@ sort , and then were quickly h@@ an@@ ded over to In@@ d@@ one@@ si@@ an water poli@@ ce ."

We clim@@ bed a t@@ ree next to an ou@@ ter w@@ all that was top@@ ped with the sh@@ ar@@ ds of gl@@ as@@ s .

"When my do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ary was a@@ i@@ red on S@@ B@@ S D@@ at@@ el@@ ine , many of my friends came to know about my situ@@ ation , and they tr@@ ied to help me ."
They did not al@@ low me to take any other boat to ri@@ sk my life .

But it had happened to be a little bit different with me .
I was lu@@ ck@@ y .
"My cont@@ ac@@ ts worked to expe@@ di@@ te my case through U@@ N@@ H@@ C@@ R , and I got re@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ led in Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a in M@@ ay 20@@ 1@@ 3 ."
N@@ ot every as@@ y@@ lu@@ m se@@ ek@@ er is lu@@ ck@@ y like me .

"But he was a pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate teach@@ er , and I remember one of our ear@@ lie@@ r clas@@ ses with him , he was proje@@ cting images on the w@@ all , as@@ king us to think about them , and he put up an image of a pain@@ ting ."
"It was a land@@ s@@ cape with figu@@ res , se@@ mi@@ -@@ dre@@ s@@ sed , d@@ r@@ in@@ king w@@ ine .

"He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a what ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe I &apos;d pro@@ n@@ oun@@ ced it wrong ."
&quot; It &apos;s a B@@ ac@@ ch@@ an@@ al by Ti@@ ti@@ an . &quot;

"It &apos;s a fu@@ c@@ king or@@ gy ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A@@ s I said , he s@@ wor@@ e too much ."
There was an important l@@ es@@ son for me in that .
"P@@ ie@@ tr@@ o was s@@ us@@ pi@@ ci@@ ous of form@@ al art tra@@ ining , art history tra@@ ining , because he fe@@ ared that it fil@@ led people up with j@@ ar@@ g@@ on , and then they just clas@@ si@@ f@@ ied things rather than looking at them , and he wanted to re@@ mind us that all art was once con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary , and he wanted us to use our eyes , and he was es@@ pe@@ cially ev@@ ang@@ e@@ li@@ cal about this mess@@ age , because he was lo@@ sing his si@@ ght ."
He wanted us to look and ask basi@@ c questions of obje@@ cts .
What is it ? How is it made ? Why was it made ?
How is it used ?
And these were important l@@ ess@@ ons to me when I sub@@ sequ@@ ently became a prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal art histori@@ an .
"My kind of e@@ u@@ re@@ ka moment came a few years later , when I was stu@@ dy@@ ing the art of the cour@@ ts of Nor@@ ther@@ n Europ@@ e , and of course it was very much di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed in terms of the pain@@ t@@ ings and the s@@ cul@@ p@@ tu@@ res and the archite@@ cture of the day ."
"But as I began to read histori@@ cal do@@ cu@@ ments and con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary descri@@ p@@ tions , I found there was a kind of a mis@@ sing com@@ pon@@ ent , for every@@ where I came across descri@@ p@@ tions of ta@@ pe@@ str@@ ies ."
"T@@ a@@ pe@@ str@@ ies were u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous between the Mi@@ ddle A@@ ges and , really , well into the 1@@ 8@@ th century , and it was pretty ap@@ par@@ ent why ."
"T@@ a@@ pe@@ str@@ ies were port@@ able . You could ro@@ ll them up , sen@@ d them a@@ head of you , and in the time it took to h@@ an@@ g them up , you could trans@@ form a c@@ old , d@@ ank inter@@ i@@ or into a ri@@ ch@@ ly co@@ lo@@ red se@@ tting ."
"T@@ a@@ pe@@ str@@ ies effe@@ cti@@ vely provi@@ ded a v@@ ast can@@ v@@ as on which the pat@@ ron@@ s of the day could de@@ pi@@ ct the her@@ o@@ es with wh@@ om they wanted to be as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated , or even themselves , and in ad@@ di@@ tion to that , ta@@ pe@@ str@@ ies were hu@@ ge@@ ly ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
"They requi@@ red s@@ co@@ res of high@@ ly sk@@ il@@ led we@@ a@@ ver@@ s working over ex@@ ten@@ ded per@@ i@@ ods of time with very ex@@ pen@@ sive materi@@ als — the wo@@ ols , the sil@@ ks , even g@@ old and sil@@ ver th@@ read ."
"So , all in all , in an age when the vi@@ su@@ al image of any kind was r@@ are , ta@@ pe@@ str@@ ies were an incredi@@ bly pot@@ ent form of pro@@ p@@ ag@@ an@@ da ."
"Well , I became a ta@@ pe@@ stry histori@@ an ."
"In du@@ e course , I en@@ ded up as a cu@@ rat@@ or at the Me@@ tro@@ po@@ lit@@ an M@@ us@@ e@@ um , because I saw the M@@ et as one of the few places where I could organi@@ ze really big ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions about the sub@@ je@@ ct I car@@ ed so pas@@ si@@ on@@ ately about ."

It wasn &apos;t stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward . It &apos;s no longer a question of ch@@ u@@ c@@ king a ta@@ pe@@ stry in the back of a car .
"They have to be w@@ ound on huge rol@@ l@@ ers , shi@@ pped in over@@ si@@ zed fre@@ igh@@ ters ."
"S@@ ome of them are so big we had , to get them into the mus@@ e@@ um , we had to take them up the great ste@@ ps at the front ."
We thought very hard about how to present this un@@ known sub@@ je@@ ct to a moder@@ n audience : the dar@@ k col@@ ors to set off the col@@ ors that re@@ ma@@ ined in obje@@ cts that were often f@@ ad@@ ed ; the plac@@ ing of li@@ ghts to bring out the sil@@ k and the g@@ old th@@ read ; the la@@ be@@ ling .
"You know , we live in an age where we are so used to tele@@ vision images and photograph@@ s , a one@@ -@@ h@@ it image . These were big , comple@@ x things , almost like car@@ to@@ ons with mul@@ ti@@ ple nar@@ r@@ ati@@ ves ."
"We had to dra@@ w our audience in , get them to s@@ low down , to expl@@ ore the obje@@ cts ."
"There was a lot of sk@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ ci@@ sm . O@@ n the open@@ ing night , I over@@ heard one of the s@@ eni@@ or mem@@ bers of st@@ af@@ f saying , &quot; This is going to be a b@@ om@@ b . &quot;"
"But in re@@ ality , in the course of the coming weeks and months , hundre@@ ds of thousands of people came to see the show ."
"The ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion was desig@@ ned to be an experience , and ta@@ pe@@ str@@ ies are hard to re@@ produ@@ ce in photograph@@ s ."
"So I want you to use your imag@@ in@@ ations , thinking of these wal@@ l-@@ high obje@@ cts , some of them 10 me@@ ters wi@@ de , de@@ pi@@ cting la@@ vi@@ sh cour@@ t scen@@ es with cour@@ t@@ ier@@ s and d@@ and@@ ies who would look quite at home in the p@@ ages of the fas@@ hi@@ on pre@@ ss today , thi@@ ck wo@@ ods with hun@@ ters c@@ ra@@ sh@@ ing through the under@@ grow@@ th in pur@@ su@@ it of wi@@ ld bo@@ ars and de@@ er , viol@@ ent bat@@ t@@ les with scen@@ es of fe@@ ar and her@@ o@@ is@@ m ."
"I remember taking my son &apos;s school clas@@ s . He was eight at the time , and all the little bo@@ ys , they kind of — you know , they were little bo@@ ys , and then the thing that ca@@ u@@ ght their at@@ ten@@ tion was in one of the hun@@ ting scen@@ es there was a do@@ g po@@ op@@ ing in the fore@@ ground — ( Laughter ) — kind of an in@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ face jo@@ ke by the arti@@ st ."
And you can just imagine them .
But it brought it ali@@ ve to them . I think they sud@@ den@@ ly saw that these wer@@ en &apos;t just old f@@ ad@@ ed ta@@ pe@@ str@@ ies .
"These were images of the world in the past , and that it was the same for our audience ."
"And for me as a cu@@ rat@@ or , I felt pro@@ u@@ d . I felt I &apos;d shi@@ f@@ ted the need@@ le a little ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh this experience that could only be created in a mus@@ e@@ um , I &apos;d open@@ ed up the eyes of my audience — histori@@ ans , arti@@ sts , pre@@ ss , the gener@@ al public — to the beau@@ ty of this lost medi@@ um ."
"A few years later , I was in@@ vi@@ ted to be the dire@@ ctor of the mus@@ e@@ um , and after I got over that — &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o , me ? The ta@@ pe@@ stry ge@@ ek ? I don &apos;t we@@ ar a t@@ ie ! &quot; &quot; — I realized the fact : I believe pas@@ si@@ on@@ ately in that cur@@ ated mus@@ e@@ um experience ."
"We live in an age of u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous information , and sort of &quot; &quot; just ad@@ d water &quot; &quot; exper@@ ti@@ se , but there &apos;s nothing that com@@ par@@ es with the pres@@ ent@@ ation of sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant obje@@ cts in a wel@@ l-@@ told nar@@ r@@ ative , what the cu@@ rat@@ or does , the inter@@ pret@@ ation of a comple@@ x , es@@ ot@@ eri@@ c sub@@ je@@ ct , in a way that re@@ ta@@ ins the inte@@ g@@ ri@@ ty of the sub@@ je@@ ct , that makes it — un@@ pac@@ ks it for a gener@@ al audience ."
"And that , to me , today , is now the challen@@ ge and the fun of my job , sup@@ por@@ ting the vision of my cu@@ rat@@ ors , whether it &apos;s an ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion of S@@ am@@ u@@ ra@@ i s@@ words , early By@@ z@@ an@@ t@@ ine arti@@ fac@@ ts , R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance por@@ tra@@ its , or the show we heard men@@ tion@@ ed ear@@ lie@@ r , the M@@ c@@ Q@@ u@@ e@@ en show , with which we en@@ jo@@ yed so much suc@@ cess last sum@@ m@@ er ."
That was an interesting case .
"In the l@@ ate sp@@ ring , early sum@@ m@@ er of 20@@ 10 , shor@@ tly after M@@ c@@ Q@@ u@@ e@@ en &apos;s su@@ i@@ ci@@ de , our cu@@ rat@@ or of co@@ stu@@ me , An@@ dre@@ w B@@ ol@@ ton , came to see me , and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been thinking of doing a show on M@@ c@@ Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , and now is the moment .

M@@ c@@ Q@@ u@@ e@@ en had worked throu@@ gh@@ out his car@@ e@@ er with a small team of desig@@ n@@ ers and man@@ ag@@ ers who were very prote@@ ctive of his leg@@ acy , but An@@ dre@@ w went to Lon@@ don and worked with them over the sum@@ m@@ er and won their con@@ fi@@ dence , and that of the desig@@ n@@ ers who created his amazing fas@@ hi@@ on shows , which were works of perform@@ ance art in their own right ,"
"@@ and we pro@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed to do something at the mus@@ e@@ um , I think , we &apos;ve never done before ."
It wasn &apos;t just your stan@@ d@@ ard in@@ stal@@ l@@ ation .
"In fact , we ri@@ pped down the gal@@ l@@ er@@ ies to re@@ create enti@@ re@@ ly different se@@ t@@ t@@ ings , a re@@ cre@@ ation of his first studi@@ o , a h@@ all of mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r@@ s , a cu@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty box , a su@@ n@@ k@@ en ship , a bur@@ ne@@ d-@@ out inter@@ i@@ or , with vi@@ de@@ os and soun@@ d@@ trac@@ ks that r@@ ang@@ ed from oper@@ atic ari@@ as to pi@@ gs for@@ nic@@ ating ."
"And in this ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary se@@ tting , the co@@ st@@ um@@ es were like ac@@ t@@ ors and ac@@ tre@@ s@@ ses , or living s@@ cul@@ p@@ tu@@ res ."
It could have been a tra@@ in w@@ re@@ ck .
"It could have looked like sho@@ p win@@ dow@@ s on F@@ i@@ f@@ th A@@ ven@@ ue at Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , but because of the way that An@@ dre@@ w conne@@ cted with the M@@ c@@ Q@@ u@@ e@@ en team , he was ch@@ an@@ ne@@ ling the raw@@ ness and the bri@@ lli@@ ance of M@@ c@@ Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , and the show was quite tran@@ scen@@ d@@ ant , and it became a ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on in its own right ."
"B@@ y the end of the show , we had people qu@@ e@@ u@@ ing for four or five hours to get into the show , but no one really com@@ pla@@ ined ."
"I heard over and over again , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , that was wor@@ th it ."
"It was a such a vi@@ sc@@ er@@ al , emoti@@ ve experience . &quot; &quot; Now , I &apos;ve descri@@ bed two very im@@ mer@@ sive ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions , but I also believe that colle@@ ctions , individu@@ al obje@@ cts , can also have that same power ."
"The M@@ et was set up not as a mus@@ e@@ um of American art , but of an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ c mus@@ e@@ um , and today , 1@@ 40 years later , that vision is as pres@@ cient as ever , because , of course , we live in a world of cri@@ sis , of challen@@ ge , and we &apos;re ex@@ posed to it through the 2@@ 4 / 7 ne@@ w@@ s@@ re@@ els ."
"It &apos;s in our gal@@ l@@ er@@ ies that we can un@@ p@@ ack the ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations , the cul@@ tu@@ res , that we &apos;re seeing the cur@@ r@@ ent m@@ ani@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of ."

"I think for most Ameri@@ cans , know@@ le@@ dge of the Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c world was pretty s@@ light before 9 / 11 , and then it was th@@ r@@ ust upo@@ n us in one of America &apos;s dar@@ k@@ est hours , and the per@@ cep@@ tion was through the po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ ation of that terri@@ ble ev@@ ent ."
"Now , in our gal@@ l@@ er@@ ies , we show 14 cen@@ tur@@ ies of the develo@@ pment of different Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c cul@@ tu@@ res across a v@@ ast ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c sp@@ read , and , again , hundre@@ ds of thousands of people have come to see these gal@@ l@@ er@@ ies since they open@@ ed last O@@ c@@ to@@ ber ."
"I &apos;m often asked , &quot; &quot; Is di@@ gi@@ tal media re@@ plac@@ ing the mus@@ e@@ um ? &quot; &quot; and I think those num@@ bers are a re@@ soun@@ ding re@@ je@@ ction of that noti@@ on . I mean , don &apos;t get me wrong , I &apos;m a huge adv@@ oc@@ ate of the W@@ e@@ b ."
"It gi@@ ves us a way of re@@ ach@@ ing out to aud@@ ien@@ ces around the g@@ lo@@ be , but nothing re@@ places the au@@ th@@ enti@@ city of the obje@@ ct pre@@ sen@@ ted with pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship ."
"B@@ r@@ ing@@ ing people face to face with our obje@@ cts is a way of br@@ ing@@ ing them face to face with people across time , across space , wh@@ ose lives may have been very different to our own , but who , like us , had hop@@ es and dre@@ am@@ s , f@@ ru@@ str@@ ations and ach@@ ie@@ v@@ em@@ ents in their lives . And I think this is a process that hel@@ ps us better understand ourselves , hel@@ ps us make better deci@@ sions about where we &apos;re going ."
"The Gre@@ at H@@ all at the M@@ et is one of the great por@@ tal@@ s of the world , a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing , like a me@@ d@@ ie@@ v@@ al ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral ."
"F@@ ro@@ m there , you can walk in any dire@@ ction to almost any culture ."
I fre@@ qu@@ ently go out into the h@@ all and the gal@@ l@@ er@@ ies and I wat@@ ch our visi@@ t@@ ors coming in .
S@@ ome of them are comfor@@ table . They feel at home .
They know what they &apos;re looking for .
O@@ thers are very u@@ ne@@ asy . It &apos;s an in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ating place .
They feel that the institu@@ tion is e@@ li@@ ti@@ st .
I &apos;m working to try and bre@@ ak down that sense of that e@@ li@@ ti@@ sm .
"I want to put people in a con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ative fra@@ me of mind , where they &apos;re pre@@ par@@ ed to be a little bit lost , to expl@@ ore , to see the un@@ fami@@ li@@ ar in the fami@@ li@@ ar , or to try the un@@ known ."
"Because for us , it &apos;s all about br@@ ing@@ ing them face to face with great works of art , cap@@ tur@@ ing them at that moment of dis@@ comfor@@ t , when the in@@ c@@ lin@@ ation is kind of to re@@ ach for your i@@ P@@ h@@ one , your B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ ry , but to create a z@@ one where their cu@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty can ex@@ p@@ and ."
"And whether it &apos;s in the ex@@ pres@@ sion of a Gre@@ ek s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture that re@@ min@@ ds you of a friend , or a do@@ g po@@ op@@ ing in the cor@@ ner of a ta@@ pe@@ stry , or , to bring it back to my tu@@ tor P@@ ie@@ tr@@ o , those dan@@ cing figu@@ res who are in@@ de@@ ed k@@ noc@@ king back the w@@ ine , and that nu@@ de figure in the left fore@@ ground ."
W@@ ow . She is a gor@@ ge@@ ous em@@ bod@@ im@@ ent of y@@ ou@@ th@@ ful se@@ x@@ u@@ ality .
"In that moment , our sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship can tell you that this is a bac@@ ch@@ an@@ al , but if we &apos;re doing our job right , and you &apos;ve che@@ cked the j@@ ar@@ g@@ on at the front door , tr@@ ust your in@@ st@@ in@@ ct ."
You know it &apos;s an or@@ gy .
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
"For much of this time , this as@@ si@@ stance was man@@ u@@ al ."
S@@ ur@@ ve@@ il@@ l@@ ance took place man@@ u@@ ally and wi@@ res were conne@@ cted by hand .
C@@ al@@ ls were recor@@ ded to ta@@ pe .
"But as in so many other indu@@ str@@ ies , compu@@ ting has changed everything ."
The tele@@ phone comp@@ an@@ ies built sur@@ ve@@ il@@ l@@ ance fe@@ at@@ ures into the very cor@@ e of their net@@ works .
I want that to sin@@ k in for a second : O@@ ur tele@@ ph@@ ones and the net@@ works that car@@ ry our cal@@ ls were wi@@ red for sur@@ ve@@ il@@ l@@ ance first .
F@@ ir@@ st and fore@@ most .
"So what that means is that when you &apos;re talking to your spo@@ use , your children , a colle@@ ag@@ ue or your do@@ ctor on the tele@@ phone , someone could be list@@ ening ."
"But while the tele@@ phone comp@@ an@@ ies have built sur@@ ve@@ il@@ l@@ ance as a pri@@ ori@@ ty , S@@ i@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ ley comp@@ an@@ ies have not ."
"And in fact , ac@@ cor@@ ding to A@@ pp@@ le , they &apos;re not able to even see the te@@ xt mess@@ ages themselves ."
And it &apos;s not just A@@ pp@@ le .
"So , after 100 years of being able to list@@ en to any tele@@ phone call — any@@ time , any@@ where — you might imagine that government offi@@ ci@@ als are not very happy ."
"And in fact , that &apos;s what &apos;s happening ."
G@@ over@@ n@@ ment offi@@ ci@@ als are extre@@ me@@ ly ma@@ d .
And they &apos;re not ma@@ d because these en@@ c@@ ry@@ ption to@@ ols are now available .
What up@@ se@@ ts them the most is that the te@@ ch comp@@ an@@ ies have built en@@ c@@ ry@@ ption fe@@ at@@ ures into their produ@@ cts and turned them on by def@@ au@@ l@@ t .
"In shor@@ t , the te@@ ch comp@@ an@@ ies have de@@ moc@@ r@@ ati@@ zed en@@ c@@ ry@@ ption ."
"And so , government offi@@ ci@@ als like Bri@@ ti@@ sh P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er Davi@@ d C@@ am@@ er@@ on , they believe that all communi@@ c@@ ations — e@@ ma@@ il@@ s , te@@ x@@ ts , vo@@ ice cal@@ ls — all of these should be available to govern@@ ments , and en@@ c@@ ry@@ ption is making that difficult ."
"Now , look — I &apos;m extre@@ me@@ ly sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic to their point of view ."
"What that means is that if the dru@@ g de@@ al@@ ers &apos; tele@@ phone cal@@ ls or the ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sts &apos; tele@@ phone cal@@ ls can be inter@@ cep@@ ted , then so can the rest of ours , too ."
So the scen@@ ari@@ o of h@@ ac@@ king of sur@@ ve@@ il@@ l@@ ance systems that I &apos;ve descri@@ bed — this is not imag@@ in@@ ary .
"In 200@@ 9 , the sur@@ ve@@ il@@ l@@ ance systems that Go@@ og@@ le and Mi@@ cro@@ so@@ ft built into their net@@ works — the systems that they use to re@@ spo@@ nd to l@@ aw@@ ful sur@@ ve@@ il@@ l@@ ance re@@ qu@@ est@@ s from the poli@@ ce — those systems were com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ed by the Chin@@ ese government , because the Chin@@ ese government wanted to figure out which of their own ag@@ ents the U@@ S government was mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing ."
The fore@@ ig@@ n government or h@@ ac@@ k@@ ers who did that were never ca@@ u@@ ght .
"And really , this gets to the very problem with these sur@@ ve@@ il@@ l@@ ance fe@@ at@@ ures , or back@@ do@@ ors ."
"When you build a back@@ door into a communi@@ c@@ ations network or piece of technology , you have no way of contro@@ l@@ ling who &apos;s going to go through it ."
"You have no way of contro@@ l@@ ling whether it &apos;ll be used by your side or the other side , by good guys , or by bad guys ."
"And so for that reason , I think that it &apos;s better to build net@@ works to be as secu@@ re as possible ."
"@@ Yes , this means that in the future , en@@ c@@ ry@@ ption is going to make wi@@ re@@ ta@@ pping more difficult ."
It means that the poli@@ ce are going to have a tou@@ gh@@ er time cat@@ ching bad guys .
"But the alter@@ n@@ ative would mean to live in a world where any@@ one &apos;s cal@@ ls or any@@ one &apos;s te@@ xt mess@@ ages could be sur@@ ve@@ il@@ led by cri@@ min@@ als , by stal@@ k@@ ers and by fore@@ ig@@ n inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence ag@@ en@@ cies ."
And I don &apos;t want to live in that kind of world .
"And so right now , you probably have the to@@ ols to th@@ war@@ t many kinds of government sur@@ ve@@ il@@ l@@ ance already on your ph@@ ones and already in your po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts , you just might not realize how stron@@ g and how secu@@ re those to@@ ols are , or how we@@ ak the other ways you &apos;ve used to communi@@ cate really are ."
We need to secu@@ re our tele@@ phone cal@@ ls .
We need to secu@@ re our te@@ xt mess@@ ages .
I want you to use these to@@ ols .
"I want you to tell your lo@@ ved ones , I want you to tell your colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es : U@@ se these en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted communi@@ c@@ ations to@@ ols ."
"D@@ on &apos;t just use them because they &apos;re che@@ a@@ p and e@@ asy , but use them because they &apos;re secu@@ re ."
Thank you .

A@@ id is not doing too well .
We se@@ em to be fi@@ x@@ ated on this ro@@ man@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed idea that every po@@ or pe@@ as@@ ant in Africa is an ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur .
My solution : F@@ or@@ get micro@@ -@@ ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s .
M@@ o took a con@@ tr@@ ari@@ an be@@ t on Africa when he f@@ oun@@ ded C@@ el@@ te@@ l Inter@@ national in &apos; 9@@ 8 and built it into a mo@@ bi@@ le cel@@ lu@@ lar provi@@ der with 2@@ 4 million sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ bers across 14 Afri@@ can countries by 200@@ 4 .
P@@ er@@ haps we are not at a st@@ age in Africa where many ac@@ t@@ ors and small en@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses le@@ ads to grow@@ th through compe@@ ti@@ tion .

"I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the Uni@@ versity of C@@ alifor@@ nia ."
J@@ ust think about this problem for a second .
"H@@ ere is a lu@@ m@@ p of fl@@ es@@ h , about three po@@ un@@ ds , which you can h@@ old in the pal@@ m of your hand ."
But it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ lar space .
"It can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fini@@ ty , ask questions about the me@@ an@@ ing of its own ex@@ ist@@ ence , about the nature of God ."
And this is tru@@ ly the most amazing thing in the world .
It &apos;s the gre@@ at@@ est m@@ yst@@ ery con@@ fron@@ ting human be@@ ings : How does this all come about ?
"Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neuron@@ s ."
We &apos;re looking at neuron@@ s here .
There are 100 billion neuron@@ s in the ad@@ ul@@ t human brain .
"And each neuro@@ n makes something like 1@@ ,000 to 1@@ 0,000 cont@@ ac@@ ts with other neuron@@ s in the brain ."
"And based on this , people have cal@@ cu@@ lated that the number of per@@ mu@@ t@@ ations and com@@ bin@@ ations of brain acti@@ vity ex@@ ce@@ eds the number of ele@@ ment@@ ary parti@@ cles in the universe ."
"So , how do you go about stu@@ dy@@ ing the brain ?"
"One appro@@ ach is to look at patients who had le@@ sions in different part of the brain , and study chang@@ es in their behavi@@ or ."
This is what I spo@@ ke about in the last TED .
"T@@ od@@ ay I &apos;ll talk about a different appro@@ ach , which is to put ele@@ c@@ tro@@ des in different par@@ ts of the brain , and actually recor@@ d the acti@@ vity of individu@@ al ner@@ ve cells in the brain ."
S@@ or@@ t of e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ p on the acti@@ vity of ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
"Now , one re@@ cent disco@@ very that has been made by resear@@ ch@@ ers in I@@ tal@@ y , in Par@@ ma , by G@@ i@@ ac@@ om@@ o Ri@@ z@@ z@@ ol@@ att@@ i and his colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es , is a group of neuron@@ s called mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neuron@@ s , which are on the front of the brain in the fron@@ tal lo@@ be@@ s ."
"Now , it turns out there are neuron@@ s which are called ordin@@ ary mot@@ or comm@@ and neuron@@ s in the front of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years ."
These neuron@@ s will fi@@ re when a person perform@@ s a speci@@ fic action .
"For example , if I do that , and re@@ ach and gra@@ b an app@@ le , a mot@@ or comm@@ and neuro@@ n in the front of my brain will fi@@ re ."
"If I re@@ ach out and pu@@ ll an obje@@ ct , another neuro@@ n will fi@@ re , com@@ man@@ ding me to pu@@ ll that obje@@ ct ."
These are called mot@@ or comm@@ and neuron@@ s that have been known for a long time .
"But what Ri@@ z@@ z@@ ol@@ att@@ i found was a sub@@ set of these neuron@@ s , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fi@@ re when I &apos;m looking at somebody else perform@@ ing the same action ."
"So , here is a neuro@@ n that fi@@ res when I re@@ ach and gra@@ b something , but it also fi@@ res when I wat@@ ch Jo@@ e re@@ ach@@ ing and gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing something ."
And this is tru@@ ly ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing .
Because it &apos;s as though this neuro@@ n is ad@@ op@@ ting the other person &apos;s point of view .
It &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s perform@@ ing a vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al re@@ ality si@@ mul@@ ation of the other person &apos;s action .
"Now , what is the sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ance of these mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neuron@@ s ?"
F@@ or one thing they must be inv@@ olved in things like imi@@ tation and e@@ mul@@ ation .
Because to imi@@ t@@ ate a comple@@ x act requi@@ res my brain to ad@@ op@@ t the other person &apos;s point of view .
"So , this is important for imi@@ tation and e@@ mul@@ ation ."
"Well , why is that important ?"
"Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next sli@@ de ."
"So , how do you do imi@@ tation ? Why is imi@@ tation important ?"
"M@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neuron@@ s and imi@@ tation , e@@ mul@@ ation ."
"Now , let &apos;s look at culture , the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on of human culture ."
"If you go back in time about &#91; 7@@ 5@@ ,000 &#93; to 10@@ 0,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human ev@@ olution , it turns out that something very important happened around 7@@ 5@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And that is , there is a sud@@ den em@@ er@@ g@@ ence and ra@@ pi@@ d sp@@ read of a number of sk@@ il@@ ls that are uni@@ qu@@ e to human be@@ ings like to@@ ol use , the use of fi@@ re , the use of sh@@ el@@ ters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else &apos;s mind and inter@@ pre@@ t that person &apos;s behavi@@ or ."
All of that happened relati@@ vely quickly .
"E@@ ven though the human brain had ach@@ ie@@ ved its present size almost three or four hundre@@ d thous@@ and years ago , 10@@ 0,000 years ago all of this happened very , very quickly ."
"And I c@@ la@@ im that what happened was the sud@@ den em@@ er@@ g@@ ence of a s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neuro@@ n system , which allow@@ ed you to e@@ mul@@ ate and imi@@ t@@ ate other people &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"So that when there was a sud@@ den ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ al disco@@ very by one member of the group , say the use of fi@@ re , or a particular ty@@ pe of to@@ ol , instead of dy@@ ing out , this sp@@ read ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly , h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ t@@ ally across the popul@@ ation , or was trans@@ mi@@ t@@ ted ver@@ ti@@ cally , down the gener@@ ations ."
"So , this made ev@@ olution sud@@ den@@ ly L@@ am@@ ar@@ c@@ ki@@ an , instead of D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ an ."
D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ an ev@@ olution is s@@ low ; it takes hundre@@ ds of thousands of years .
"A pol@@ ar be@@ ar , to ev@@ ol@@ ve a co@@ at , will take thousands of gener@@ ations , maybe 10@@ 0,000 years ."
"A human being , a child , can just wat@@ ch its par@@ ent ki@@ ll another pol@@ ar be@@ ar , and sk@@ in it and put the sk@@ in on its body , fu@@ r on the body , and learn it in one ste@@ p . What the pol@@ ar be@@ ar took 10@@ 0,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes ."
And then once it &apos;s learned this it sp@@ re@@ ads in ge@@ ome@@ tri@@ c pro@@ por@@ tion across a popul@@ ation .
This is the basi@@ s . The imi@@ tation of comple@@ x sk@@ il@@ ls is what we call culture and is the basi@@ s of ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation .
"Now there is another kind of mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neuro@@ n , which is inv@@ olved in something quite different ."
"And that is , there are mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neuron@@ s , just as there are mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neuron@@ s for action , there are mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neuron@@ s for tou@@ ch ."
"In other words , if somebody tou@@ ch@@ es me , my hand , neuro@@ n in the som@@ at@@ osen@@ sor@@ y cor@@ te@@ x in the sen@@ sor@@ y regi@@ on of the brain fi@@ res ."
"But the same neuro@@ n , in some c@@ ases , will fi@@ re when I simply wat@@ ch another person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , it &apos;s em@@ pa@@ thi@@ z@@ ing the other person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , most of them will fi@@ re when I &apos;m tou@@ ched in different lo@@ c@@ ations . D@@ i@@ f@@ fer@@ ent neuron@@ s for different lo@@ c@@ ations ."
But a sub@@ set of them will fi@@ re even when I wat@@ ch somebody else being tou@@ ched in the same lo@@ cation .
"So , here again you have neuron@@ s which are en@@ rol@@ led in em@@ pa@@ th@@ y ."
"Now , the question then ar@@ is@@ es : If I simply wat@@ ch another person being tou@@ ched , why do I not get con@@ f@@ used and liter@@ ally feel that tou@@ ch sen@@ s@@ ation mer@@ ely by wat@@ ching somebody being tou@@ ched ?"
"I mean , I em@@ pa@@ thi@@ ze with that person but I don &apos;t liter@@ ally feel the tou@@ ch ."
"Well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got re@@ cep@@ t@@ ors in your sk@@ in , tou@@ ch and pa@@ in re@@ cep@@ t@@ ors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry , you &apos;re not being tou@@ ched ."
"So , em@@ pa@@ thi@@ ze , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the tou@@ ch , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se you &apos;ll get con@@ f@@ used and mu@@ dd@@ led . &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , so there is a fe@@ ed@@ back sig@@ na@@ l that ve@@ to@@ es the sig@@ na@@ l of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neuro@@ n pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing you from con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously exper@@ ien@@ cing that tou@@ ch ."
"But if you re@@ move the ar@@ m , you simply an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze my ar@@ m , so you put an in@@ je@@ ction into my ar@@ m , an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze the brac@@ hi@@ al ple@@ x@@ us , so the ar@@ m is num@@ b , and there is no sen@@ s@@ ations coming in , if I now wat@@ ch you being tou@@ ched , I liter@@ ally feel it in my hand ."
"In other words , you have dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ r@@ ier between you and other human be@@ ings ."
"So , I call them G@@ and@@ h@@ i neuron@@ s , or em@@ pa@@ th@@ y neuron@@ s ."
( Laughter ) And this is not in some ab@@ strac@@ t me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ori@@ cal sense .
"A@@ ll that &apos;s se@@ par@@ ating you from him , from the other person , is your sk@@ in ."
"R@@ e@@ move the sk@@ in , you experience that person &apos;s tou@@ ch in your mind ."
You &apos;ve dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ r@@ ier between you and other human be@@ ings .
"And this , of course , is the basi@@ s of much of E@@ ast@@ er@@ n phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y , and that is there is no real in@@ depen@@ dent self , al@@ o@@ of from other human be@@ ings , in@@ spe@@ cting the world , in@@ spe@@ cting other people ."
"You are , in fact , conne@@ cted not just vi@@ a F@@ ace@@ book and Inter@@ net , you &apos;re actually quite liter@@ ally conne@@ cted by your neuron@@ s ."
"And there is whole cha@@ ins of neuron@@ s around this room , talking to each other ."
And there is no real di@@ st@@ in@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess of your con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness from somebody else &apos;s con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness .
And this is not mu@@ m@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ um@@ bo phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y .
It em@@ er@@ ges from our under@@ standing of basi@@ c neuro@@ science .
"So , you have a patien@@ t with a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b . If the ar@@ m has been re@@ mo@@ ved and you have a ph@@ an@@ tom , and you wat@@ ch somebody else being tou@@ ched , you feel it in your ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"Now the ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing thing is , if you have pa@@ in in your ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b , you squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze the other person &apos;s hand , mas@@ s@@ age the other person &apos;s hand , that re@@ lie@@ ves the pa@@ in in your ph@@ an@@ tom hand , almost as though the neuro@@ n were ob@@ ta@@ ining re@@ lie@@ f from mer@@ ely wat@@ ching somebody else being mas@@ s@@ aged ."
"So , here you have my last sli@@ de ."
F@@ or the lon@@ gest time people have re@@ gar@@ ded science and hum@@ ani@@ ties as being di@@ st@@ in@@ ct .
"C@@ .@@ P@@ . S@@ now spo@@ ke of the two cul@@ tu@@ res : science on the one hand , hum@@ ani@@ ties on the other ; never the t@@ wa@@ in sh@@ all me@@ et ."
"So , I &apos;m saying the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neuro@@ n system under@@ l@@ ies the inter@@ face allow@@ ing you to re@@ think about issu@@ es like con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness , re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of self , what se@@ par@@ ates you from other human be@@ ings , what allow@@ s you to em@@ pa@@ thi@@ ze with other human be@@ ings , and also even things like the em@@ er@@ g@@ ence of culture and ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , which is uni@@ qu@@ e to human be@@ ings . Thank you ."

Mo@@ st people don &apos;t know that when I went to high school in this country — I ap@@ pl@@ ied for uni@@ versity at a time when I was con@@ v@@ in@@ ced I was going to be an arti@@ st and be a s@@ cul@@ p@@ tor .
And I came from a very pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed back@@ ground . I was very lu@@ ck@@ y .
"My family was we@@ al@@ th@@ y , and my father belie@@ ved in one thing , and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted ."
And I an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced I wanted to be a s@@ cul@@ p@@ tor in Par@@ is .
"And he was a cle@@ ver man . He sort of said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s OK , but you &apos;ve done very well in your mat@@ h S@@ A@@ T@@ s . &quot;"
"In fact , I &apos;d got an 8@@ 00 . And he thought I did very well — and I did , too — in the ar@@ ts : this was my pas@@ sion ."
"And he said &quot; &quot; If you go to M@@ I@@ T , &quot; &quot; to which I had been given early ad@@ mis@@ sion , &quot; &quot; I will pay for every year you &apos;re at M@@ I@@ T , in gra@@ du@@ ate or under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate — as much as you want — I will pay for an equ@@ al number of years for you to live in Par@@ is . &quot; &quot; And I thought that was the best deal in tow@@ n , so I ac@@ cep@@ ted it im@@ medi@@ ately ."
"And I decided that if I was good in art , and I was good in ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs , I &apos;d study archite@@ cture , which was the b@@ len@@ ding of the two ."
"I went and told my he@@ ad@@ ma@@ ster that , at pre@@ p school ."
"And I said to him what I was doing , that I was going to go study archite@@ cture because it was art and ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs put together ."
He said to me something that just went completely over my head .
"He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I like gre@@ y su@@ its , and I like p@@ in@@ -@@ stri@@ ped su@@ its , but I don &apos;t like gre@@ y p@@ in@@ -@@ stri@@ ped su@@ its . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; What a tur@@ key this guy is , &quot; &quot; and I went off to M@@ I@@ T ."
"I stud@@ ied archite@@ cture , then did a second de@@ gre@@ e in archite@@ cture , and then actually quickly realized that it wasn &apos;t archite@@ cture ."
"That really , the mi@@ x@@ ing of art and science was compu@@ ters , and that that really was the place to bring both , and en@@ jo@@ yed a car@@ e@@ er doing that ."
"And probably , if I were to fi@@ ll out J@@ im C@@ i@@ tr@@ in &apos;s scale , I &apos;d put 100 percent on the side of the equ@@ ation where you spend time making it possible for others to be cre@@ ative ."
"And after doing this for a long time , and the Me@@ di@@ a L@@ a@@ b pas@@ sing the bat@@ on on , I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s time for me to do a project ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing that would be important , but also something that would take adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of all of these pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ es that one had . &quot; &quot; And in the case of the Me@@ di@@ a L@@ a@@ b , know@@ ing a lot of people , know@@ ing people who were either ex@@ e@@ cu@@ ti@@ ves or we@@ al@@ th@@ y , and also not having , in my own case , a car@@ e@@ er to wor@@ ry about any@@ more ."
"My car@@ e@@ er , I mean , I &apos;d done my car@@ e@@ er ."
D@@ i@@ dn &apos;t have to wor@@ ry about ear@@ ning money .
D@@ i@@ dn &apos;t have to wor@@ ry about what people thought about me .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ y , let &apos;s really do something that takes adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of all these fe@@ at@@ ures , &quot; &quot; and thought that if we could ad@@ dre@@ ss education , by le@@ ver@@ ag@@ ing the children , and br@@ ing@@ ing to the world the ac@@ cess of the compu@@ ters , that that was really the thing we should do ."
"N@@ ever sh@@ own this picture before , and probably going to be su@@ ed for it ."
"It &apos;s taken at three o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the morning , without the per@@ mis@@ sion of the company ."
"It &apos;s about two weeks old . There they are , fol@@ ks ."
"( Applause ) If you look at the picture , you &apos;ll see they &apos;re st@@ ac@@ ked up ."
Th@@ ose are con@@ ve@@ y@@ or be@@ l@@ ts that go around .
"This is one of the con@@ ve@@ y@@ or be@@ l@@ ts with the thing going by , but then you &apos;ll see the ones up ab@@ o@@ ve ."
"What happens is , they bur@@ n into f@@ las@@ h memor@@ y the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are , and then test them for a few hours ."
"But you &apos;ve got to have the thing moving on the as@@ se@@ m@@ bly line , because it &apos;s con@@ st@@ ant ."
"So they go around in this loo@@ p , which is why you see them up there ."
So this was great for us because it was a real tur@@ ning point . But it goes back .
"This picture was taken in 19@@ 8@@ 2 , just before the I@@ B@@ M P@@ C was even an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced ."
S@@ ey@@ m@@ our P@@ a@@ per@@ t and I were br@@ ing@@ ing compu@@ ters to scho@@ ols and develo@@ ping n@@ ations at a time when it was way a@@ head of itself .
But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolu@@ tely j@@ um@@ p into it just the same way as our kids do here .
"And when people tell me , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o &apos;s going to te@@ ach the teach@@ ers to te@@ ach the kids ? &quot; &quot; I say to myself , &quot; &quot; What planet do you come from ? &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , there &apos;s not a person in this room — I don &apos;t care how tech@@ ie you are — there &apos;s not a person in this room that doesn &apos;t give their lap@@ top or cell phone to a kid to help them de@@ bu@@ g it . OK ?"
"We all need help , even those of us who are very se@@ as@@ on@@ ed ."
"This picture of S@@ ey@@ m@@ our — 25 years ago . S@@ ey@@ m@@ our made a very simple obser@@ vation in 19@@ 6@@ 8 , and then basically pre@@ sen@@ ted it in 19@@ 70 — Ap@@ ri@@ l 11 to be pre@@ ci@@ se — called &quot; &quot; T@@ e@@ ach@@ ing Ch@@ il@@ dren Th@@ in@@ king . &quot; &quot; What he obser@@ ved was that kids who write computer progra@@ ms understand things differ@@ ently , and when they de@@ bu@@ g the progra@@ ms , they come the clo@@ s@@ est to lear@@ ning about lear@@ ning ."
"That was very important , and in some sense , we &apos;ve lost that ."
"K@@ i@@ ds don &apos;t program enough and bo@@ y , if there &apos;s anything I hope this br@@ ings back , it &apos;s progra@@ m@@ ming to kids ."
"It &apos;s really important . U@@ sing app@@ lic@@ ations is OK , but progra@@ m@@ ming is absolu@@ tely fundam@@ ent@@ al ."
"This is being la@@ un@@ ched with three langu@@ ages in it : S@@ qu@@ e@@ ak , L@@ o@@ go , and a third , that I &apos;ve never even seen before ."
"The point being , this is going to be very , very inten@@ sive on the progra@@ m@@ ming side ."
This photogra@@ ph is very important because it &apos;s much later .
"This is in the early 200@@ 0s . My son , D@@ imi@@ tr@@ i — who &apos;s here , many of you know D@@ imi@@ tr@@ i — went to C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia , set up this school that we had built , just as the school conne@@ cted it to the Inter@@ net ."
"And these kids had their lap@@ top@@ s . But it was really what spi@@ ri@@ ted this , p@@ lu@@ s the in@@ flu@@ ence of Jo@@ e and others . We started One L@@ ap@@ top per Chi@@ ld ."
"This is the same vi@@ ll@@ age in C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia , just a couple of months ago ."
"These kids are real pro@@ s . There were just 7@@ ,000 mach@@ ines out there being test@@ ed by kids . Be@@ ing a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it is absolu@@ tely fundam@@ ent@@ al ."
"E@@ very@@ body ad@@ vi@@ sed me not to be a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it , but they were all wrong ."
And the reason being a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it is important is actually two@@ f@@ old .
"There are many reas@@ ons , but the two that mer@@ it the little bit of time is : one , the c@@ lar@@ ity of pur@@ pos@@ e is there . The mor@@ al pur@@ pos@@ e is clear ."
"I can see any head of state , any ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tive I want , at any time , because I &apos;m not sel@@ ling lap@@ top@@ s . OK ? I have no sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders ."
"W@@ he@@ ther we se@@ ll , it doesn &apos;t make any difference wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ."
The c@@ lar@@ ity of pur@@ pos@@ e is absolu@@ tely cri@@ tical . And the second is very coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive — you can get the best people in the world .
"If you look at our prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal ser@@ vi@@ ces , inclu@@ ding sear@@ ch fir@@ ms , inclu@@ ding communi@@ c@@ ations , inclu@@ ding leg@@ al ser@@ vi@@ ces , inclu@@ ding ban@@ king , they &apos;re all pr@@ o b@@ ono . And it &apos;s not to sa@@ ve money ."
We &apos;ve got money in the b@@ ank . It &apos;s because you get the best people .
"You get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mis@@ sion , and they &apos;re the best people ."
"We couldn &apos;t af@@ for@@ d to hi@@ re a C@@ F@@ O . We put out a job descri@@ ption for a C@@ F@@ O at zer@@ o s@@ al@@ ary , and we had a qu@@ e@@ ue of people ."
"It allow@@ s you to team up with people . The U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s not going to be our part@@ ner if we &apos;re prof@@ it making . So an@@ n@@ oun@@ cing this with K@@ of@@ i An@@ na@@ n was very important , and the U.@@ N@@ . allow@@ ed us to basically re@@ ach all the countries . And this was the mach@@ ine we were show@@ ing before I met Y@@ ves Be@@ ha@@ r ."
"And while this mach@@ ine in some sense is sil@@ ly , in re@@ tro@@ spe@@ ct , it actually ser@@ ved a very important pur@@ pos@@ e ."
That pen@@ ci@@ l-@@ y@@ el@@ low c@@ ran@@ k was re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed by everybody .
E@@ very@@ body re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed the pen@@ ci@@ l-@@ y@@ el@@ low c@@ ran@@ k . It &apos;s different .
It was getting its power in a different way . It &apos;s kind of chil@@ d@@ like .
"E@@ ven though this wasn &apos;t the dire@@ ction we went because the c@@ ran@@ k — it really is stu@@ pi@@ d to have it on bo@@ ard , by the way ."
"In spi@@ te of what some people in the pre@@ ss don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do — having it on the lap@@ top itself is really not what you want ."
"You want a se@@ par@@ ate thing , like the A@@ C ad@@ ap@@ tor ."
"I didn &apos;t bring one with me , but they really work much better of@@ f-@@ bo@@ ard ."
"And then , I could tell you lots about the lap@@ top , but I decided on just four things ."
"J@@ ust keep in mind — because there are other people , inclu@@ ding Bi@@ ll G@@ ates , who said , &quot; &quot; G@@ e@@ e , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot; &quot; That computer is un@@ like anything you &apos;ve had , and does things — there are four of them — that you don &apos;t come close to . And it &apos;s very important to be low power , and I hope that &apos;s pi@@ cked up more by the indu@@ stry ."
That the reason that you want to be be@@ low two wat@@ ts is that &apos;s rou@@ gh@@ ly what you can gener@@ ate with your u@@ pp@@ er body .
D@@ u@@ al@@ -@@ mo@@ de disp@@ l@@ ay — that su@@ n@@ light disp@@ l@@ ay &apos;s fanta@@ stic .
"We were using it at lu@@ n@@ ch today in the su@@ n@@ light , and the more su@@ n@@ light the better ."
"And that was really cri@@ tical . The m@@ es@@ h network , it &apos;ll become com@@ mon@@ place ."
"And of course , &quot; &quot; ru@@ gg@@ ed &quot; &quot; goes without saying ."
And the reason I think design mat@@ ters isn &apos;t because I wanted to go to art school .
"And by the way , when I gra@@ du@@ ated from M@@ I@@ T , I thought the wor@@ st and sil@@ lie@@ st thing to do would be to go to Par@@ is for six years . ( Laughter ) So , I didn &apos;t do that . But design mat@@ ters for a number of reas@@ ons ."
The most important being that it is the best way to make an in@@ ex@@ pen@@ sive produ@@ ct .
"Mo@@ st people make in@@ ex@@ pen@@ sive produ@@ cts by taking che@@ a@@ p design , che@@ a@@ p lab@@ or , che@@ a@@ p com@@ pon@@ ents , and making a che@@ a@@ p lap@@ top ."
"And , in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , the word &quot; &quot; che@@ a@@ p &quot; &quot; has a d@@ ou@@ ble me@@ an@@ ing , which is really appro@@ pri@@ ate , because it &apos;s che@@ a@@ p , in the pe@@ j@@ or@@ ative sense , as well as in@@ ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
"But if you take a different appro@@ ach , and you think of very lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale inte@@ gr@@ ation , very adv@@ an@@ ced materi@@ als , very adv@@ an@@ ced man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing — so you &apos;re po@@ ur@@ ing chemi@@ cal@@ s in one end , i@@ Pod@@ s are spe@@ w@@ ing out the other — and really cool design , that &apos;s what we wanted to do ."
And I can rac@@ e through these and sa@@ ve a lot of time because Y@@ ves and I obvi@@ ously didn &apos;t comp@@ are not@@ es .
"These are his sli@@ des , and so I don &apos;t have to talk about them ."
"But it was really , to us , very important as a strate@@ gy ."
"It wasn &apos;t just to kind of make it cu@@ te , because somebody — you know , good design is very important ."
Y@@ ves show@@ ed one of the power@@ -@@ gener@@ ating de@@ vi@@ ces .
"The m@@ es@@ h network , the reason I — and I won &apos;t go into it in great de@@ ta@@ il — but when we deli@@ ver lap@@ top@@ s to kids in the re@@ mot@@ est and po@@ ore@@ st par@@ ts of the world , they &apos;re conne@@ cted . There &apos;s not just lap@@ top@@ s ."
"And so , we have to dro@@ p in s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te di@@ sh@@ es . We put in gener@@ at@@ ors ."
It &apos;s a lot of stuff that goes behind these . These can talk to each other .
"If you &apos;re in a des@@ er@@ t , they can talk to each other about two kilome@@ ters a@@ part ."
"If you &apos;re in the j@@ un@@ g@@ le , it &apos;s about 500 me@@ ters . So if a kid bi@@ cy@@ cles home , or wal@@ ks a few miles , they &apos;re going to be off the g@@ ri@@ d , so to speak ."
"They &apos;re not going to be ne@@ ar another lap@@ top , so you have to na@@ il these on@@ to a t@@ ree , and sort of , get it ."
You don &apos;t call V@@ eri@@ z@@ on or S@@ pr@@ int . You build your own network .
"And that &apos;s very important , the us@@ er inter@@ face ."
We are la@@ un@@ ching with 18 ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds . En@@ g@@ li@@ sh is by far the min@@ ori@@ ty .
"L@@ at@@ in is relati@@ vely r@@ are , too . You just look at some of the langu@@ ages ."
I &apos;m wil@@ ling to s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct some of you ha@@ dn &apos;t even heard of them before .
"I@@ s there any@@ body in the room , one person , un@@ less you work with O@@ L@@ P@@ C , is there any@@ body in the room that can tell me what language the ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard is that &apos;s on the scre@@ en ? There &apos;s only one hand — so you get it ."
"@@ Yes , you &apos;re right . He &apos;s right . It &apos;s Am@@ har@@ ic , it &apos;s E@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ an . In E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , there &apos;s never been a ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard ."
There is no ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard stan@@ d@@ ard because there &apos;s no market .
And this is the big difference .
"A@@ ga@@ in , when you &apos;re a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it , you look at children as a mis@@ sion , not as a market ."
"So we went to E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , and we hel@@ ped them make a ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard ."
And this will become the stan@@ d@@ ard E@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ an ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard .
So what I want to end with is sort of what we &apos;re doing to ro@@ ll it out .
"And we changed strate@@ gy completely . I decided at the beginning — it was a pretty good thing to deci@@ de in the beginning , it &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing now — is to go to six countries ."
"B@@ i@@ g countries , one of them is not so big , but it &apos;s ri@@ ch ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s the six . We went to the six , and in each case the head of state said he would do it , he &apos;d do a million ."
"In the case of G@@ ad@@ d@@ af@@ i , he &apos;d do 1@@ .@@ 2 million , and that they would la@@ un@@ ch it ."
"We thought , this is exactly the right strate@@ gy , get it out , and then the little countries could sort of pi@@ gg@@ y@@ back on these big countries ."
"And so I went to each of those countries at least six times , met with the head of state probably two or three times ."
"In each case , got the min@@ ist@@ ers , went through a lot of the stuff ."
This was a per@@ i@@ od in my life where I was tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing 3@@ 30 days per year .
N@@ ot something you &apos;d en@@ v@@ y or want to do .
"In the case of Li@@ by@@ a , it was a lot of fun me@@ e@@ ting G@@ ad@@ d@@ af@@ i in his t@@ ent ."
The cam@@ el s@@ me@@ l@@ ls were un@@ belie@@ v@@ able .
"And it was 4@@ 5 de@@ gre@@ es C@@ . I mean , this was not what you &apos;d call a cool experience . And form@@ er countries — I say form@@ er , because n@@ one of them really came through this sum@@ m@@ er — there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a ph@@ oto opportunity , make a pre@@ ss rele@@ ase ."
"So we went to s@@ mal@@ ler ones . U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay , bl@@ ess their hear@@ ts ."
"S@@ mall country , not so ri@@ ch . P@@ resi@@ dent said he &apos;d do it , and gu@@ ess what ?"
"He did do it . The ten@@ der had nothing in it that re@@ lated to us , nothing speci@@ fic about su@@ n@@ li@@ gh@@ t-@@ re@@ ad@@ able , m@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ network , low@@ -@@ power , but just a v@@ ani@@ l@@ la lap@@ top pro@@ pos@@ al ."
And gu@@ ess what ? We won it h@@ ands down .
"When it was an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced that they were going to do every child in U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay , the first 10@@ 0,000 , bo@@ om , went to O@@ L@@ P@@ C ."
"The next day — the next day , not even 2@@ 4 hours had pas@@ sed — in P@@ er@@ u , the pre@@ si@@ dent of P@@ er@@ u said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll do 2@@ 50 . &quot; &quot; And bo@@ om , a little dom@@ in@@ o effe@@ ct ."
The pre@@ si@@ dent of R@@ wan@@ da ste@@ pped in and said he would do it .
The pre@@ si@@ dent of E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia said he would do it .
"And bo@@ om , bo@@ om , bo@@ om . The pre@@ si@@ dent of M@@ on@@ go@@ li@@ a ."
"And so what happens is , these things start to happen with these countries — still not enough ."
"A@@ d@@ d up all those countries , it didn &apos;t quite get to thing , so we said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s start a program in the United States . &quot; &quot; So , end of Au@@ g@@ ust , early Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber , we deci@@ de to do this . We an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced it ne@@ ar the mi@@ ddle , end — just when the C@@ lin@@ ton I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative was taking place ."
We thought that was a good time to an@@ n@@ oun@@ ce it .
L@@ a@@ un@@ ched it on the 12 of N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber .
We said it would be just for a shor@@ t per@@ i@@ od until the 2@@ 6 . We &apos;ve ex@@ ten@@ ded it until the 3@@ 1 .
"And the &quot; &quot; G@@ i@@ ve One , G@@ et One &quot; &quot; program is really important because it got a lot of people absolu@@ tely interested ."
"The first day it was just wi@@ ld . And then we said , &quot; &quot; Well , let &apos;s get people to give many . N@@ ot just one , and get one , but maybe give 100 , give 1@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s where you come in ."
"And that &apos;s where I think it &apos;s very important . I don &apos;t want you all to go out and bu@@ y 4@@ 00 dollars wor@@ th of lap@@ top@@ s . O@@ kay ? Do it , but that &apos;s not going to help . O@@ kay ?"
"If everybody in this room goes out ton@@ ight and or@@ ders one of these things for 4@@ 00 dollars , whatever it is , 3@@ 00 people in the room doing it — ye@@ ah , great ."
I want you do something else .
"And it &apos;s not to go out and bu@@ y 100 or 1@@ ,000 , though , I in@@ vi@@ te you to do that , and 1@@ 0,000 would be even better ."
"T@@ ell people about it ! It &apos;s got to become vi@@ ral , OK ?"
U@@ se your ma@@ il@@ ing li@@ sts . Pe@@ ople in this room have ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ma@@ il@@ ing li@@ sts .
"G@@ et your friends to give one , get one ."
"And if each one of you sen@@ ds it to 3@@ 00 or 4@@ 00 people , that would be fanta@@ stic ."
I won &apos;t d@@ well on the pri@@ cing at all .
"J@@ ust to say that when you do the &quot; &quot; G@@ i@@ ve One , G@@ et One , &quot; &quot; a lot of pre@@ ss is a bit about , &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t make it , it &apos;s 1@@ 8@@ 8 dollars , it &apos;s not 100 . &quot; &quot; It will be 100 in two years . It will go be@@ low 100 ."
"We &apos;ve ple@@ d@@ g@@ ed not to ad@@ d fe@@ at@@ ures , but to bring that pri@@ ce down ."
"But it was the countries that wanted it to go up , and we let them p@@ us@@ h it up for all sor@@ ts of reas@@ ons . So what you can do — I &apos;ve just said it . D@@ on &apos;t just give one , get one ."
"I just want to end with one last one . This one is not even 2@@ 4@@ -@@ hours old , or maybe it &apos;s 2@@ 4@@ -@@ hours ."
"The first kids got their lap@@ top@@ s . They got them by ship , and I &apos;m talking now about 7@@ ,000 , 8@@ ,000 at a time went out this week ."
"They went to U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay , P@@ er@@ u , M@@ exi@@ co ."
"And it &apos;s been s@@ low coming , and we &apos;re only making about 5@@ ,000 a week , but we hope , we hope , some@@ time in next year , maybe by the mi@@ ddle of the year , to h@@ it a million a mon@@ th . Now put that number , and a million isn &apos;t so much . It &apos;s not a big number ."
We &apos;re sel@@ ling a billion cell ph@@ ones wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de this year .
But a million a mon@@ th in lap@@ top@@ -@@ land is a big number .
"And the world produ@@ ction today , everybody com@@ b@@ ined , making lap@@ top@@ s , is five million a mon@@ th . So I &apos;m standing here tel@@ ling you that some@@ time next year , we &apos;re going to make 20 percent of the world produ@@ ction ."
"And if we do that , there are going to be a lot of lu@@ ck@@ y kids out there ."
"And we hope if you have E@@ G two years from now , or wh@@ en@@ ever you have it again , I won &apos;t have bad bre@@ ath , and I will be in@@ vi@@ ted back , and will have , hop@@ e@@ fully by then , maybe 100 million out there to children ."
Thank you .

"What I &apos;d like to start off with is an obser@@ vation , which is that if I &apos;ve learned anything over the last year , it &apos;s that the su@@ pre@@ me i@@ ro@@ ny of publi@@ sh@@ ing a book about s@@ low@@ ness is that you have to go around pro@@ mot@@ ing it really f@@ ast ."
"I se@@ em to spend most of my time these days zi@@ pping from city to city , studi@@ o to studi@@ o , inter@@ view to inter@@ view , ser@@ ving up the book in really t@@ iny bi@@ te@@ -@@ size ch@@ un@@ ks ."
"Because everyone these days wan@@ ts to know how to s@@ low down , but they want to know how to s@@ low down really quickly . So ..."
so I did a spo@@ t on C@@ N@@ N the other day where I actually spent more time in mak@@ e@@ up than I did talking on air .
"And I think that — that &apos;s not really sur@@ pri@@ sing though , is it ?"
"Because that &apos;s kind of the world that we live in now , a world stu@@ ck in f@@ ast@@ -@@ forward ."
"A world ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with speed , with doing everything f@@ ast@@ er , with c@@ ra@@ m@@ ming more and more into less and less time ."
E@@ very moment of the day feel@@ s like a rac@@ e against the clo@@ ck .
"To bor@@ row a ph@@ ra@@ se from C@@ ar@@ r@@ ie F@@ i@@ sh@@ er , which is in my bi@@ o there ; I &apos;ll just to@@ ss it out again — &quot; &quot; These days even in@@ st@@ ant gr@@ ati@@ fi@@ cation takes too long . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And if you think about how we to try to make things better , what do we do ?"
"No , we speed them up , don &apos;t we ? So we used to di@@ al ; now we speed di@@ al ."
We used to read ; now we speed read . We used to walk ; now we speed walk .
"And of course , we used to d@@ ate and now we speed d@@ ate ."
And even things that are by their very nature s@@ low — we try and speed them up too .
"So I was in New York re@@ cent@@ ly , and I wal@@ ked past a g@@ ym that had an ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se@@ ment in the win@@ do@@ w for a new course , a new ev@@ ening course ."
"And it was for , you gu@@ ess@@ ed it , speed y@@ og@@ a ."
"So this — the perfe@@ ct solution for ti@@ me@@ -@@ star@@ ved prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als who want to , you know , s@@ al@@ u@@ te the su@@ n , but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it ."
"I mean , these are sort of the extre@@ me exam@@ ples , and they &apos;re am@@ using and good to l@@ au@@ gh at ."
"But there &apos;s a very seri@@ ous point , and I think that in the he@@ ad@@ long d@@ as@@ h of da@@ i@@ ly life , we often lo@@ se si@@ ght of the dam@@ age that this ro@@ ad@@ ru@@ n@@ ner form of living does to us ."
"We &apos;re so mar@@ in@@ ated in the culture of speed that we almost fa@@ il to noti@@ ce the t@@ ol@@ l it takes on every aspe@@ ct of our lives — on our health , our d@@ ie@@ t , our work , our relation@@ ships , the environment and our community ."
"And sometimes it takes a wa@@ ke@@ -@@ up call , doesn &apos;t it , to al@@ er@@ t us to the fact that we &apos;re h@@ ur@@ ry@@ ing through our lives , instead of actually living them ; that we &apos;re living the f@@ ast life , instead of the good life ."
"And I think for many people , that wa@@ ke@@ -@@ up call takes the form of an il@@ l@@ ness ."
"You know , a bur@@ n@@ out , or ev@@ en@@ tually the body says , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t take it any@@ more , &quot; &quot; and th@@ row@@ s in the tow@@ el ."
"O@@ r maybe a relation@@ ship goes up in smo@@ ke because we ha@@ ven &apos;t had the time , or the pat@@ ience , or the tran@@ qui@@ lity , to be with the other person , to list@@ en to them ."
"And my wa@@ ke@@ -@@ up call came when I started re@@ ading be@@ d@@ time stories to my son , and I found that at the end of day , I would go into his room and I just couldn &apos;t s@@ low down — you know , I &apos;d be speed re@@ ading &quot; &quot; The C@@ at In The H@@ at . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d be — you know , I &apos;d be sk@@ i@@ pping lin@@ es here , par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s there , sometimes a whole p@@ age , and of course , my little bo@@ y knew the book inside out , so we would qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l ."
"And what should have been the most re@@ la@@ x@@ ing , the most in@@ ti@@ m@@ ate , the most ten@@ der moment of the day , when a d@@ ad si@@ ts down to read to his son , became instead this kind of gl@@ ad@@ i@@ at@@ ori@@ al bat@@ tle of wil@@ ls , a clas@@ h between my speed and his s@@ low@@ ness ."
"And this went on for some time , until I ca@@ u@@ ght myself sc@@ an@@ ning a ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er arti@@ cle with ti@@ m@@ es@@ a@@ ving ti@@ ps for f@@ ast people ."
And one of them made re@@ fer@@ ence to a ser@@ ies of boo@@ ks called &quot; The O@@ ne@@ -@@ M@@ in@@ u@@ te B@@ ed@@ time St@@ ory . &quot;
"And I win@@ ce saying those words now , but my first re@@ action at the time was very different ."
"My first ref@@ le@@ x was to say , &quot; &quot; H@@ al@@ le@@ lu@@ j@@ ah — what a great idea !"
"This is exactly what I &apos;m looking for to speed up be@@ d@@ time even more . &quot; &quot; But th@@ an@@ k@@ fully , a light bu@@ l@@ b went on over my head , and my next re@@ action was very different , and I took a ste@@ p back , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a — you know , has it really come to this ?"
"A@@ m I really in such a h@@ ur@@ ry that I &apos;m pre@@ par@@ ed to fo@@ b off my son with a sound by@@ te at the end of the day ? &quot; &quot; And I put away the ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er — and I was getting on a pl@@ ane — and I s@@ at there , and I did something I ha@@ dn &apos;t done for a long time — which is I did nothing ."
"I just thought , and I thought long and hard ."
"And by the time I got off that pl@@ ane , I &apos;d decided I wanted to do something about it ."
"I wanted to inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ate this whole ro@@ ad@@ ru@@ n@@ ner culture , and what it was doing to me and to everyone else ."
And I had two questions in my head .
"The first was , how did we get so f@@ ast ?"
"And the second is , is it possible , or even de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble , to s@@ low down ?"
"Now , if you think about how our world got so ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated , the usu@@ al s@@ us@@ pe@@ cts re@@ ar their he@@ ads ."
"You think of , you know , urb@@ ani@@ z@@ ation , con@@ sum@@ eri@@ sm , the wor@@ k@@ place , technology ."
"But I think if you cut through those for@@ ces , you get to what might be the de@@ e@@ per dri@@ ver , the nu@@ b of the question , which is how we think about time itself ."
"In other cul@@ tu@@ res , time is cy@@ cli@@ cal ."
"It &apos;s seen as moving in great , un@@ h@@ ur@@ ried cir@@ cles ."
It &apos;s always ren@@ ew@@ ing and re@@ fre@@ sh@@ ing itself .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as in the W@@ est , time is lin@@ e@@ ar ."
It &apos;s a fini@@ te re@@ source ; it &apos;s always dra@@ ining away .
"You either use it , or lo@@ se it ."
"&quot; &quot; Ti@@ me is money , &quot; &quot; as B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in Fran@@ kli@@ n said ."
And I think what that does to us psycho@@ logi@@ cally is it cre@@ ates an equ@@ ation .
"T@@ i@@ me is sc@@ ar@@ ce , so what do we do ?"
"Well — well , we speed up , don &apos;t we ?"
We try and do more and more with less and less time .
"We turn every moment of every day into a rac@@ e to the fin@@ is@@ h line — a fin@@ is@@ h line , in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , that we never re@@ ach , but a fin@@ is@@ h line n@@ one@@ the@@ less ."
"And I gu@@ ess that the question is , is it possible to bre@@ ak f@@ ree from that min@@ d@@ set ?"
"And th@@ an@@ k@@ fully , the answer is y@@ es , because what I disco@@ vered , when I began looking around , that there is a global bac@@ klas@@ h against this culture that tel@@ ls us that f@@ ast@@ er is always better , and that bus@@ ier is best ."
"R@@ ight across the world , people are doing the un@@ thin@@ k@@ able : they &apos;re s@@ low@@ ing down , and fin@@ ding that , al@@ though con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal wi@@ s@@ dom tel@@ ls you that if you s@@ low down , you &apos;re ro@@ ad ki@@ ll , the op@@ posi@@ te turns out to be true : that by s@@ low@@ ing down at the right mom@@ ents , people find that they do everything better ."
They e@@ at better ; they make love better ; they ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se better ; they work better ; they live better .
"And , in this kind of ca@@ ul@@ dro@@ n of mom@@ ents and places and ac@@ ts of de@@ cel@@ er@@ ation , lie what a lot of people now ref@@ er to as the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ national S@@ low Mo@@ v@@ ement . &quot; &quot; Now if you &apos;ll per@@ m@@ it me a small act of hy@@ po@@ cri@@ sy , I &apos;ll just give you a very qui@@ ck over@@ view of what &apos;s going on inside the S@@ low Mo@@ v@@ ement . If you think of food , many of you will have heard of the S@@ low F@@ o@@ od movement ."
"S@@ tar@@ ted in I@@ tal@@ y , but has sp@@ read across the world , and now has 10@@ 0,000 mem@@ bers in 50 countries ."
"And it &apos;s dri@@ ven by a very simple and sen@@ si@@ ble mess@@ age , which is that we get more ple@@ as@@ ure and more health from our food when we cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ate , co@@ ok and con@@ su@@ me it at a reas@@ on@@ able p@@ ace ."
"I think also the ex@@ plo@@ sion of the organi@@ c far@@ ming movement , and the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance of farm@@ ers &apos; marke@@ ts , are other il@@ lu@@ str@@ ations of the fact that people are des@@ per@@ ate to get away from e@@ ating and co@@ o@@ king and cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ating their food on an indu@@ stri@@ al ti@@ me@@ table ."
They want to get back to s@@ low@@ er r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms .
"And out of the S@@ low F@@ o@@ od movement has grow@@ n something called the S@@ low C@@ it@@ ies movement , which has started in I@@ tal@@ y , but has sp@@ read right across Europ@@ e and be@@ y@@ ond ."
"And in this , tow@@ ns beg@@ in to re@@ think how they organi@@ ze the urb@@ an land@@ s@@ cape , so that people are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to s@@ low down and s@@ me@@ ll the ro@@ ses and conne@@ ct with one another ."
"So they might cur@@ b traf@@ fic , or put in a par@@ k b@@ en@@ ch , or some green space ."
"And in some ways , these chang@@ es ad@@ d up to more than the su@@ m of their par@@ ts , because I think when a S@@ low C@@ ity be@@ comes offi@@ cially a S@@ low C@@ ity , it &apos;s kind of like a phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ hi@@ cal dec@@ lar@@ ation ."
"It &apos;s saying to the rest of world , and to the people in that tow@@ n , that we believe that in the 2@@ 1@@ st century , s@@ low@@ ness has a ro@@ le to play ."
"In medi@@ cine , I think a lot of people are de@@ e@@ ply di@@ sil@@ lu@@ si@@ on@@ ed with the kind of quick@@ -@@ fi@@ x ment@@ ality you find in con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal medi@@ cine ."
"And mi@@ llions of them around the world are tur@@ ning to comple@@ ment@@ ary and alter@@ n@@ ative form@@ s of medi@@ cine , which ten@@ d to ta@@ p into sort of s@@ low@@ er , g@@ ent@@ ler , more ho@@ li@@ stic form@@ s of heal@@ ing ."
"Now , obvi@@ ously the j@@ ury is out on many of these comple@@ ment@@ ary ther@@ a@@ pie@@ s , and I per@@ son@@ ally d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that the co@@ f@@ fe@@ e en@@ em@@ a will ever , you know , ga@@ in ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am appro@@ v@@ al ."
"But other tre@@ at@@ ments such as ac@@ u@@ pun@@ cture and mas@@ s@@ age , and even just re@@ la@@ x@@ ation , c@@ lear@@ ly have some kind of b@@ en@@ ef@@ it ."
"And blu@@ e-@@ chi@@ p medi@@ cal col@@ leg@@ es every@@ where are star@@ ting to study these things to find out how they work , and what we might learn from them ."
"S@@ e@@ x . There &apos;s an aw@@ ful lot of f@@ ast se@@ x around , isn &apos;t there ?"
I was coming to — well — no pu@@ n inten@@ ded there .
"I was making my way , let &apos;s say , s@@ low@@ ly to O@@ x@@ for@@ d , and I went through a news ag@@ ent , and I saw a mag@@ az@@ ine , a men &apos;s mag@@ az@@ ine , and it said on the front , &quot; How to bring your part@@ ner to or@@ g@@ as@@ m in 30 secon@@ ds . &quot;"
"So , you know , even se@@ x is on a stop@@ wat@@ ch these days ."
"Now , you know , I like a qui@@ c@@ kie as much as the next person , but I think that there &apos;s an aw@@ ful lot to be ga@@ ined from s@@ low se@@ x — from s@@ low@@ ing down in the be@@ dro@@ om ."
"You know , you ta@@ p into that — those de@@ e@@ per , sort of , psycho@@ logi@@ cal , emoti@@ onal , spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al cur@@ r@@ ents , and you get a better or@@ g@@ as@@ m with the buil@@ du@@ p ."
"You can get more ban@@ g for your bu@@ ck , let &apos;s say ."
"I mean , the Po@@ in@@ ter S@@ ist@@ ers said it most e@@ lo@@ qu@@ ently , didn &apos;t they , when they s@@ an@@ g the pra@@ is@@ es of &quot; &quot; a lo@@ ver with a s@@ low hand . &quot; &quot; Now , we all l@@ augh@@ ed at S@@ ting a few years ago when he went T@@ an@@ tri@@ c , but you f@@ ast@@ -@@ forward a few years , and now you find cou@@ ples of all ages flo@@ c@@ king to wor@@ k@@ sh@@ op@@ s , or maybe just on their own in their own be@@ dro@@ oms , fin@@ ding ways to put on the bra@@ k@@ es and have better se@@ x ."
"And of course , in I@@ tal@@ y where — I mean , I@@ t@@ ali@@ ans always se@@ em to know where to find their ple@@ as@@ ure — they &apos;ve la@@ un@@ ched an offi@@ cial S@@ low Se@@ x movement ."
The wor@@ k@@ place .
R@@ ight across much of the world — Nor@@ th America being a not@@ able ex@@ cep@@ tion — working hours have been coming down .
"And Europ@@ e is an example of that , and people fin@@ ding that their qu@@ ality of life impro@@ ves as they &apos;re working less , and also that their h@@ our@@ ly produ@@ cti@@ vity goes up ."
"Now , c@@ lear@@ ly there are problems with the 3@@ 5@@ -@@ hour wor@@ kwe@@ ek in Fran@@ ce — too much , too so@@ on , too ri@@ gi@@ d ."
"But other countries in Europ@@ e , not@@ ably the Nor@@ di@@ c countries , are show@@ ing that it &apos;s possible to have a ki@@ ck@@ -@@ as@@ s econom@@ y without being a wor@@ ka@@ ho@@ li@@ c ."
"And Nor@@ way , S@@ we@@ den , D@@ en@@ mar@@ k and F@@ in@@ land now ran@@ k am@@ ong the top six most compe@@ ti@@ tive n@@ ations on Earth , and they work the kind of hours that would make the a@@ ver@@ age American we@@ ep with en@@ v@@ y ."
"And if you go be@@ y@@ ond sort of the country level , down at the micro@@ -@@ company level , more and more comp@@ an@@ ies now are realiz@@ ing that they need to al@@ low their st@@ af@@ f either to work fe@@ wer hours or just to un@@ p@@ lu@@ g — to take a lu@@ n@@ ch bre@@ ak , or to go si@@ t in a qu@@ ie@@ t room , to s@@ wit@@ ch off their B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ ry@@ s and lap@@ top@@ s — you at the back — mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones , during the work day or on the we@@ ek@@ end , so that they have time to re@@ char@@ ge and for the brain to sli@@ de into that kind of cre@@ ative mo@@ de of thought ."
"It &apos;s not just , though , these days , ad@@ ul@@ ts who over@@ work , though , is it ? It &apos;s children , too ."
"I &apos;m 3@@ 7 , and my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od en@@ ded in the mi@@ d@@ - &apos; 8@@ 0s , and I look at kids now , and I &apos;m just amaz@@ ed by the way they rac@@ e around with more h@@ ome@@ work , more tu@@ tor@@ ing , more ex@@ trac@@ ur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lars than we would ever have con@@ cei@@ ved of a gener@@ ation ago ."
"And some of the most hear@@ tr@@ ending e@@ ma@@ il@@ s that I get on my we@@ b@@ site are actually from ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ents ho@@ ver@@ ing on the ed@@ ge of bur@@ n@@ out , ple@@ ading with me to write to their parents , to help them s@@ low down , to help them get off this fu@@ ll@@ -@@ th@@ ro@@ t@@ tle tre@@ ad@@ mi@@ ll ."
"But th@@ an@@ k@@ fully , there is a bac@@ klas@@ h there in par@@ ent@@ ing as well , and you &apos;re fin@@ ding that , you know , tow@@ ns in the United States are now ban@@ ding together and ban@@ ning ex@@ trac@@ ur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lars on a particular day of the mon@@ th , so that people can , you know , de@@ com@@ pre@@ ss and have some family time , and s@@ low down ."
"H@@ ome@@ work is another thing . There are h@@ ome@@ work b@@ ans sp@@ r@@ ing@@ ing up all over the develo@@ ped world in scho@@ ols which had been pi@@ ling on the h@@ ome@@ work for years , and now they &apos;re disco@@ ver@@ ing that less can be more ."
"So there was a case up in S@@ c@@ ot@@ land re@@ cent@@ ly where a fe@@ e-@@ pa@@ ying , high-@@ ach@@ ie@@ ving pri@@ v@@ ate school ban@@ ned h@@ ome@@ work for everyone under the age of 1@@ 3 , and the high-@@ ach@@ ie@@ ving parents fre@@ ak@@ ed out and said , &quot; &quot; What are you — you know , our kids will f@@ all &quot; &quot; — the he@@ ad@@ ma@@ ster said , &quot; No , no , your children need to s@@ low down at the end of the day . &quot;"
"And just this last mon@@ th , the ex@@ am resul@@ ts came in , and in mat@@ h , science , mar@@ ks went up 20 percent on a@@ ver@@ age last year ."
"And I think what &apos;s very re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing is that the e@@ li@@ te uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties , who are often ci@@ ted as the reason that people dri@@ ve their kids and ho@@ thou@@ se them so much , are star@@ ting to noti@@ ce the c@@ ali@@ ber of students coming to them is fal@@ ling . These kids have wonderful mar@@ ks ; they have C@@ V@@ s j@@ am@@ med with ex@@ trac@@ ur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lars , to the point that would make your eyes water ."
"But they l@@ ack sp@@ ar@@ k ; they l@@ ack the ability to think cre@@ ati@@ vely and think outside — they don &apos;t know how to dre@@ am . And so what these I@@ v@@ y Le@@ ag@@ ue scho@@ ols , and O@@ x@@ for@@ d and C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge and so on , are star@@ ting to sen@@ d a mess@@ age to parents and students that they need to put on the bra@@ k@@ es a little bit ."
"And in H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , for in@@ stance , they sen@@ d out a let@@ ter to under@@ gra@@ du@@ ates — fre@@ sh@@ men — tel@@ ling them that they &apos;ll get more out of life , and more out of H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , if they put on the bra@@ k@@ es , if they do less , but give time to things , the time that things need , to en@@ jo@@ y them , to sa@@ v@@ or them ."
And even if they sometimes do nothing at all .
"And that let@@ ter is called — very re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing , I think — &quot; &quot; S@@ low D@@ own ! &quot; &quot; — with an ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ation mar@@ k on the end ."
"So wh@@ er@@ ever you look , the mess@@ age , it seem@@ s to me , is the same : that less is very often more , that s@@ low@@ er is very often better . But that said , of course , it &apos;s not that e@@ asy to s@@ low down , is it ?"
"I mean , you heard that I got a spe@@ e@@ ding ti@@ ck@@ et while I was resear@@ ching my book on the b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts of s@@ low@@ ness , and that &apos;s true , but that &apos;s not all of it ."
I was actually en rou@@ te to a din@@ ner he@@ ld by S@@ low F@@ o@@ od at the time .
"And if that &apos;s not sha@@ ming enough , I got that ti@@ ck@@ et in I@@ tal@@ y ."
"And if any of you have ever dri@@ ven on an I@@ t@@ ali@@ an high@@ way , you &apos;ll have a pretty good idea of how f@@ ast I was going ."
( Laughter ) But why is it so hard to s@@ low down ?
I think there are v@@ ari@@ ous reas@@ ons .
"One is that speed is fun , you know , speed is se@@ x@@ y ."
It &apos;s all that ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine rus@@ h . It &apos;s hard to give it up .
"I think there &apos;s a kind of me@@ ta@@ physi@@ cal di@@ men@@ sion — that speed be@@ comes a way of wal@@ ling ourselves off from the bi@@ g@@ ger , de@@ e@@ per questions ."
"We fi@@ ll our head with di@@ strac@@ tion , with bus@@ y@@ ness , so that we don &apos;t have to ask , am I well ? A@@ m I happy ? A@@ re my children grow@@ ing up right ?"
A@@ re poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans making good deci@@ sions on my be@@ half ?
"A@@ no@@ ther reason — al@@ though I think , per@@ haps , the most powerful reason — why we find it hard to s@@ low down is the cul@@ tu@@ ral tab@@ o@@ o that we &apos;ve er@@ e@@ cted against s@@ low@@ ing down ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ low &quot; &quot; is a di@@ r@@ ty word in our culture .
"It &apos;s a by@@ word for &quot; &quot; la@@ zy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sl@@ ac@@ k@@ er , &quot; &quot; for being somebody who gi@@ ves up ."
"You know , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a bit s@@ low . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s actually syn@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous with being stu@@ pi@@ d ."
"I gu@@ ess what the S@@ low Mo@@ v@@ ement — the pur@@ pos@@ e of the S@@ low Mo@@ v@@ ement , or its ma@@ in go@@ al , really , is to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le that tab@@ o@@ o , and to say that y@@ es , sometimes s@@ low is not the answer , that there is such a thing as &quot; &quot; bad s@@ low . &quot; &quot; You know , I got stu@@ ck on the M@@ 25 , which is a ring ro@@ ad around Lon@@ don , re@@ cent@@ ly , and spent thre@@ e-@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half hours there . And I can tell you , that &apos;s really bad s@@ low ."
"But the new idea , the sort of re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary idea , of the S@@ low Mo@@ v@@ ement , is that there is such a thing as &quot; &quot; good s@@ low , &quot; &quot; too ."
"And good s@@ low is , you know , taking the time to e@@ at a me@@ al with your family , with the T@@ V s@@ wit@@ ched off ."
O@@ r taking the time to look at a problem from all ang@@ les in the offi@@ ce to make the best deci@@ sion at work .
O@@ r even simply just taking the time to s@@ low down and sa@@ v@@ or your life .
"Now , one of the things that I found most up@@ li@@ f@@ ting about all of this stuff that &apos;s happened around the book since it came out , is the re@@ action to it ."
"And I knew that when my book on s@@ low@@ ness came out , it would be wel@@ com@@ ed by the New A@@ ge bri@@ g@@ ade , but it &apos;s also been taken up , with great gu@@ sto , by the cor@@ por@@ ate world — you know , business pre@@ ss , but also big comp@@ an@@ ies and le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship organiz@@ ations ."
"Because people at the top of the cha@@ in , people like you , I think , are star@@ ting to realize that there &apos;s too much speed in the system , there &apos;s too much bus@@ y@@ ness , and it &apos;s time to find , or get back to that lost art of shi@@ f@@ ting g@@ ear@@ s ."
"A@@ no@@ ther en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing sig@@ n , I think , is that it &apos;s not just in the develo@@ ped world that this idea &apos;s been taken up . In the develo@@ ping world , in countries that are on the ver@@ ge of making that lea@@ p into first world stat@@ us — China , B@@ raz@@ il , T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , P@@ ol@@ and , and so on — these countries have em@@ brac@@ ed the idea of the S@@ low Mo@@ v@@ ement , many people in them , and there &apos;s a de@@ b@@ ate going on in their media , on the stre@@ ets ."
"Because I think they &apos;re looking at the W@@ est , and they &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we like that aspe@@ ct of what you &apos;ve got , but we &apos;re not so sure about that . &quot; &quot; So all of that said , is it , I gu@@ ess , is it possible ?"
That &apos;s really the ma@@ in question before us today . Is it possible to s@@ low down ? And I &apos;m happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a re@@ soun@@ ding y@@ es .
"And I present myself as E@@ x@@ hi@@ bit A , a kind of re@@ form@@ ed and re@@ ha@@ bi@@ lit@@ ated spe@@ ed@@ -@@ a@@ ho@@ li@@ c ."
"I still love speed . You know , I live in Lon@@ don , and I work as a jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st , and I en@@ jo@@ y the bu@@ z@@ z and the bus@@ y@@ ness , and the ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine rus@@ h that comes from both of those things ."
"I play squ@@ as@@ h and ice ho@@ ck@@ ey , two very f@@ ast spor@@ ts , and I wouldn &apos;t give them up for the world ."
"But I &apos;ve also , over the last year or so , got in tou@@ ch with my in@@ ner tor@@ to@@ ise ."
( Laughter ) And what that means is that I no longer over@@ lo@@ ad myself gr@@ at@@ u@@ it@@ ously .
My def@@ au@@ l@@ t mo@@ de is no longer to be a rus@@ h@@ -@@ a@@ ho@@ li@@ c .
"I no longer hear time &apos;s w@@ ing@@ ed ch@@ ari@@ ot d@@ raw@@ ing ne@@ ar , or at least not as much as I did before ."
"I can actually hear it now , because I see my time is ti@@ c@@ king off ."
"And the up@@ sh@@ ot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot ha@@ p@@ pie@@ r , health@@ ier , more produ@@ ctive than I ever have ."
I feel like I &apos;m living my life rather than actually just rac@@ ing through it .
"And per@@ haps , the most important meas@@ ure of the suc@@ cess of this is that I feel that my relation@@ ships are a lot de@@ e@@ per , ri@@ ch@@ er , stron@@ ger ."
"And for me , I gu@@ ess , the lit@@ mu@@ s test for whether this would work , and what it would mean , was always going to be be@@ d@@ time stories , because that &apos;s sort of where the jour@@ ney began . And there too the news is ro@@ sy . You know , at the end of the day , I go into my son &apos;s room ."
"I don &apos;t we@@ ar a wat@@ ch . I s@@ wit@@ ch off my computer , so I can &apos;t hear the e@@ ma@@ il p@@ ing@@ ing into the bas@@ k@@ et , and I just s@@ low down to his p@@ ace and we read ."
"And because children have their own tem@@ po and inter@@ na@@ l clo@@ ck , they don &apos;t do qu@@ ality time , where you s@@ che@@ du@@ le 10 minutes for them to open up to you ."
They need you to move at their r@@ hy@@ th@@ m .
"I find that 10 minutes into a story , you know , my son will sud@@ den@@ ly say , &quot; &quot; You know , something happened in the pla@@ y@@ ground today that really bo@@ ther@@ ed me . &quot; &quot; And we &apos;ll go off and have a convers@@ ation on that ."
"And I now find that be@@ d@@ time stories used to be a box on my to@@ -@@ do li@@ st , something that I dre@@ ad@@ ed , because it was so s@@ low and I had to get through it quickly ."
"It &apos;s become my re@@ ward at the end of the day , something I really ch@@ eri@@ sh ."
"And I have a kind of H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood ending to my talk this af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , which goes a little bit like this : a few months ago , I was getting ready to go on another book t@@ our , and I had my b@@ ag@@ s pac@@ ked ."
"I was dow@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s by the front door , and I was wai@@ ting for a ta@@ x@@ i , and my son came down the sta@@ ir@@ s and he &apos;d made a car@@ d for me . And he was car@@ ry@@ ing it ."
"He &apos;d gone and st@@ ap@@ led two car@@ ds , very like these , together , and put a sti@@ ck@@ er of his fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te char@@ ac@@ ter , T@@ in@@ t@@ in , on the front ."
"And he said to me , or he h@@ an@@ ded this to me , and I read it , and it said , &quot; &quot; To D@@ ad@@ dy , love B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; A@@ w , that &apos;s really s@@ we@@ et ."

There &apos;s the form@@ er S@@ o@@ vie@@ t me@@ gal@@ om@@ ani@@ ac@@ s .
"S@@ a@@ par@@ mu@@ r@@ at Ni@@ y@@ az@@ o@@ v , he was one of them ."
"U@@ n@@ til his death in 200@@ 6 , he was the al@@ l-@@ powerful lea@@ der of T@@ ur@@ k@@ m@@ eni@@ stan , a C@@ ent@@ ral A@@ si@@ an country ri@@ ch in natural gas ."
"Now , he really lo@@ ved to issue pre@@ si@@ den@@ tial de@@ cre@@ es ."
"Well , I can tell you that , in the ri@@ gi@@ d structure and high@@ ly compe@@ ti@@ tive nature of the Kore@@ an school system , also known as pres@@ sure co@@ ok@@ er , not everyone can do well in that environment ."
"W@@ hi@@ le many people respon@@ ded in different ways about our education system , my respon@@ se to the high-@@ pres@@ sure environment was making bow@@ s with pie@@ ces of wood found ne@@ ar my a@@ part@@ ment building ."
Why bow@@ s ?
I &apos;m not quite sure .
"P@@ er@@ haps , in the face of con@@ st@@ ant pres@@ sure , my ca@@ v@@ em@@ an in@@ st@@ in@@ ct of survi@@ v@@ al has conne@@ cted with the bow@@ s ."
"If you think about it , the b@@ ow has really hel@@ ped dri@@ ve human survi@@ v@@ al since pre@@ histor@@ ic times ."
"The area within three kilome@@ ters of my home used to be a mul@@ ber@@ ry fore@@ st during the Jo@@ se@@ on dy@@ na@@ sty , where sil@@ k@@ wor@@ ms were f@@ ed with mul@@ ber@@ ry lea@@ ves ."
"In order to ra@@ ise the histori@@ cal aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess of this fact , the government has plan@@ ted mul@@ ber@@ ry tre@@ es ."
The se@@ eds from these tre@@ es also have sp@@ read by bir@@ ds here and there ne@@ ar@@ by the soun@@ d@@ pro@@ of wal@@ ls of the city ex@@ pres@@ s@@ way that has been built around the 19@@ 8@@ 8 O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ cs .
"The area ne@@ ar these wal@@ ls , which no@@ body bo@@ thers to pay at@@ ten@@ tion to , had been left f@@ ree from major inter@@ ven@@ tion , and this is where I first found my tre@@ as@@ ures ."
"As I fe@@ ll de@@ e@@ per into b@@ ow making , I began to sear@@ ch far and be@@ y@@ ond my neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
"And they would be some@@ things like sa@@ ws , k@@ ni@@ ves , si@@ ck@@ les and ax@@ es that I co@@ vered up with a piece of tow@@ el ."
"I would bring the bran@@ ch@@ es home , ri@@ ding bus@@ es and sub@@ ways , bar@@ ely hol@@ ding them in my h@@ ands ."
And I did not bring the to@@ ols here to L@@ ong Be@@ ach .
A@@ ir@@ port secu@@ ri@@ ty .
"( Laughter ) In the pri@@ vac@@ y of my room , co@@ vered in sa@@ w@@ d@@ ust , I would saw , tri@@ m and poli@@ sh wood all night long until a b@@ ow took sha@@ pe ."
"One day , I was chang@@ ing the sha@@ pe of a b@@ am@@ bo@@ o piece and en@@ ded up se@@ tting the place on fi@@ re ."
"W@@ here ? The ro@@ of@@ top of my a@@ part@@ ment building , a place where 9@@ 6 fam@@ il@@ ies call home ."
"A cu@@ st@@ om@@ er from a de@@ part@@ ment stor@@ e across from my building called 9@@ 11 , and I ran dow@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s to tell my mo@@ m with half of my ha@@ ir bur@@ ned ."
"I want to take this opportunity to tell my mo@@ m , in the audience today : M@@ om , I was really sor@@ ry , and I will be more car@@ e@@ ful with open fi@@ re from now on ."
"My mother had to do a lot of expla@@ ining , tel@@ ling people that her son did not comm@@ it a pre@@ medi@@ t@@ ated ar@@ son ."
I also resear@@ ched ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vely on bow@@ s around the world .
"In that process , I tr@@ ied to com@@ b@@ ine the different bow@@ s from across time and places to create the most effe@@ ctive b@@ ow ."
"I also worked with many different typ@@ es of wood , such as ma@@ ple , ye@@ w and mul@@ ber@@ ry , and did many sho@@ ot@@ ing experim@@ ents in the wo@@ od@@ ed area ne@@ ar the urb@@ an ex@@ pres@@ s@@ way that I men@@ tion@@ ed before ."
The most effe@@ ctive b@@ ow for me would be like this .
One : C@@ ur@@ ved ti@@ ps can ma@@ x@@ imi@@ ze the sp@@ r@@ ing@@ iness when you dra@@ w and sho@@ ot the ar@@ row .
"T@@ wo : B@@ el@@ ly is d@@ raw@@ n in@@ ward for high@@ er dra@@ w we@@ ight , which means more power ."
Th@@ ree : S@@ in@@ e@@ w used in the ou@@ ter la@@ y@@ er of the lim@@ b for ma@@ x@@ i@@ mu@@ m ten@@ sion stor@@ age .
And four : H@@ or@@ n used to stor@@ e energy in com@@ pres@@ sion .
"A@@ f@@ ter fi@@ x@@ ing , bre@@ aking , re@@ desig@@ ning , men@@ ding , b@@ ending and am@@ ending , my ide@@ al b@@ ow began to take sha@@ pe , and when it was finally done , it looked like this ."
I was so pro@@ u@@ d of myself for inv@@ ent@@ ing a perfe@@ ct b@@ ow on my own .
"This is a picture of Kore@@ an tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal bow@@ s taken from a mus@@ e@@ um , and see how my b@@ ow re@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ les them ."
"Th@@ an@@ ks to my an@@ c@@ est@@ ors for rob@@ b@@ ing me of my inv@@ en@@ tion . ( Laughter ) Th@@ rou@@ gh bow@@ making , I came in cont@@ act with part of my h@@ eri@@ t@@ age ."
L@@ ear@@ ning the information that has ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ lated over time and re@@ ading the mess@@ age left by my an@@ c@@ est@@ ors were better than any con@@ sol@@ ation ther@@ ap@@ y or piece of ad@@ vice any living ad@@ ul@@ ts could give me .
"You see , I sear@@ ched far and wi@@ de , but never bo@@ ther@@ ed to look close and ne@@ ar ."
"F@@ ro@@ m this realiz@@ ation , I began to take inter@@ est in Kore@@ an history , which had never inspi@@ red me before ."
"In the end , the gra@@ ss is often gre@@ en@@ er on my side of the f@@ ence , al@@ though we don &apos;t realize it ."
"Now , I am going to show you how my b@@ ow works ."
And let &apos;s see how this one works .
"This is a b@@ am@@ bo@@ o b@@ ow , with 4@@ 5@@ -@@ po@@ u@@ nd dra@@ w we@@ igh@@ ts ."
"( N@@ o@@ ise of sho@@ ot@@ ing ar@@ row ) ( Applause ) A b@@ ow may fun@@ ction in a simple mechani@@ sm , but in order to make a good b@@ ow , a great amount of sen@@ si@@ ti@@ vity is requi@@ red ."
You need to con@@ so@@ le and communi@@ cate with the wood materi@@ al .
"E@@ ach fi@@ ber in the wood has its own reason and fun@@ ction for being , and only through co@@ oper@@ ation and har@@ mon@@ y am@@ ong them comes a great b@@ ow ."
"My ide@@ al world is a place where no one is left behind , where everyone is needed exactly where they are , like the fi@@ bers and the ten@@ d@@ ons in a b@@ ow , a place where the stron@@ g is f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble and the v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able is re@@ sil@@ ien@@ t ."
"The b@@ ow re@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ les me , and I re@@ se@@ m@@ ble the b@@ ow ."
"Now , I am sho@@ ot@@ ing a part of myself to you ."
"No , better yet , a part of my mind has just been sh@@ ot over to your mind ."
D@@ id it stri@@ ke you ?
Thank you .
( Applause )
"I &apos;ve also been going about the business of pu@@ tting down ro@@ ots , cho@@ os@@ ing a part@@ ner , making b@@ ab@@ ies ."
We live in ten@@ u@@ ous times .
"In fact , for the first time in American history , the maj@@ ori@@ ty of parents do not think that their kids will be better off than they were ."
"This is true of ri@@ ch and po@@ or , men and women ."
"Now , some of you might hear this and feel sa@@ d ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , America is de@@ e@@ ply inv@@ est@@ ed in this idea of economic tran@@ scen@@ dence , that every gener@@ ation kind of le@@ ap@@ fro@@ gs the one before it , ear@@ ning more , bu@@ ying more , being more ."
"But when I read this histor@@ ic po@@ ll for the first time , it didn &apos;t actually make me feel sa@@ d ."
It felt like a pro@@ v@@ oc@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; Be@@ t@@ ter off &quot; &quot; — based on wh@@ ose stan@@ dar@@ ds ?
Is &quot; &quot; better off &quot; &quot; fin@@ ding a secu@@ re job that you can coun@@ t on for the rest of your life ?
Th@@ ose are ne@@ ar@@ ly ex@@ t@@ in@@ ct .
"P@@ e@@ ople move j@@ ob@@ s , on a@@ ver@@ age , every 4@@ .@@ 7 years , and it &apos;s est@@ im@@ ated that by 20@@ 20 , ne@@ ar@@ ly half of Ameri@@ cans will be fre@@ el@@ an@@ c@@ ers ."
"O@@ K , so is better off just a number ?"
Is it about ear@@ ning as much as you possi@@ bly can ?
"B@@ y that sin@@ gu@@ lar meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment , we are fa@@ il@@ ing ."
"M@@ e@@ di@@ an per ca@@ pi@@ ta in@@ come has been f@@ lat since about 2@@ 000 , ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ed for in@@ fl@@ ation ."
"A@@ ll right , so is better off getting a big house with a white pi@@ ck@@ et f@@ ence ?"
L@@ ess of us are doing that .
"N@@ early five million people lost their hom@@ es in the Gre@@ at Re@@ ces@@ sion , and even more of us sob@@ er@@ ed up about the len@@ g@@ ths we were wil@@ ling to go — or be tri@@ cked into going , in many pre@@ d@@ at@@ ory c@@ ases — to h@@ old that de@@ ed ."
H@@ ome@@ -@@ ow@@ ner@@ ship r@@ ates are at their low@@ est since 199@@ 5 .
"A@@ ll right , so we &apos;re not fin@@ ding ste@@ ady em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment , we &apos;re not ear@@ ning as much money , and we &apos;re not living in big fan@@ cy h@@ ous@@ es ."
"But , are those the best meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments of a country &apos;s gre@@ at@@ ness , of a life well li@@ ved ?"
What I think makes America great is its sp@@ ir@@ it of re@@ inv@@ en@@ tion .
"In the wa@@ ke of the Gre@@ at Re@@ ces@@ sion , more and more Ameri@@ cans are re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing what &quot; &quot; better off &quot; &quot; really means ."
"T@@ ur@@ ns out , it has more to do with community and cre@@ ati@@ vity than dollars and c@@ ents ."
"Now , let me be very clear : the 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 8 percent of Ameri@@ cans living in po@@ ver@@ ty need money , pla@@ in and simple ."
And all of us need poli@@ cies that prote@@ ct us from ex@@ plo@@ it@@ ation by em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers and fin@@ an@@ cial institu@@ tions .
N@@ o@@ thing that fol@@ low@@ s is me@@ ant to su@@ ggest that the ga@@ p between ri@@ ch and po@@ or is anything but prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly im@@ mor@@ al .
"But , too often we let the convers@@ ation stop there ."
We talk about po@@ ver@@ ty as if it were a mon@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic experience ; about the po@@ or as if they were so@@ le@@ ly vi@@ cti@@ ms .
P@@ art of what I &apos;ve learned in my research and re@@ por@@ ting is that the art of living well is often prac@@ ti@@ ced most ma@@ ster@@ fully by the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able .
"Now , if ne@@ ces@@ sity is the mother of inv@@ en@@ tion , I &apos;ve come to believe that re@@ ces@@ sion can be the father of con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness ."
"It con@@ fron@@ ts us with pro@@ found questions , questions we might be too la@@ zy or di@@ strac@@ ted to ask in times of rel@@ ative comfor@@ t ."
How should we work ?
How should we live ?
"A@@ ll of us , whether we realize it or not , se@@ ek ans@@ w@@ ers to these questions , with our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors kind of whi@@ sp@@ ering in our ear@@ s ."
"He had , as un@@ belie@@ v@@ able as it might sound , 2@@ 1 children , with one woman , my gre@@ at@@ -@@ grand@@ mother , who d@@ ied at 4@@ 7 years old of o@@ v@@ ari@@ an can@@ cer ."
"Now , I &apos;m pre@@ gn@@ ant with my second child , and I cannot even fa@@ th@@ om what she must have gone through ."
And if you &apos;re trying to do the mat@@ h — there were six se@@ ts of tw@@ ins .
"So my grand@@ father , their son , became a tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing s@@ al@@ es@@ man , and he li@@ ved bo@@ om and b@@ ust ."
So my d@@ ad gre@@ w up ans@@ wer@@ ing the door for de@@ b@@ t colle@@ ct@@ ors and pre@@ ten@@ ding his parents wer@@ en &apos;t home .
"So my d@@ ad , un@@ sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly , became a ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ cy la@@ wy@@ er ."
"C@@ ouldn &apos;t write this in a no@@ vel , right ?"
He was ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with provi@@ ding a secu@@ re f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for my bro@@ ther and I@@ .
So I ask these questions by way of a few gener@@ ations of stru@@ gg@@ le .
My parents made sure that I gre@@ w up on a kind of ste@@ ady ground that allow@@ s one to question and ri@@ sk and lea@@ p .
"And i@@ ro@@ ni@@ cally , and probably sometimes to their f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation , it is their ste@@ ad@@ f@@ ast com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment to secu@@ ri@@ ty that allow@@ s me to question its val@@ ue , or at least its val@@ ue as we &apos;ve histori@@ cally de@@ fin@@ ed it in the 2@@ 1@@ st century ."
So let &apos;s di@@ g into this first question : How should we work ?
We should work like our mo@@ thers .
That &apos;s right — we &apos;ve spent de@@ ca@@ des trying to f@@ it women into a work world built for company men .
"And many have done back@@ b@@ en@@ ds to f@@ it in , but others have car@@ ved a more un@@ con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal pat@@ h , cre@@ ating a pat@@ ch@@ work of me@@ an@@ ing and money with enough f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility to do what they need to do for those that they love ."
They &apos;re wa@@ king up to their de@@ si@@ re and du@@ ty to be present fa@@ thers and s@@ ons .
"In other words , what we work on@@ "
is what we understand about the world .
"If this is true , and I think it is , then women who have dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately car@@ ed for the little ones and the si@@ ck ones and the ag@@ ing ones , have dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ted from the most pro@@ found kind of know@@ ing there is : know@@ ing the human con@@ di@@ tion ."
"B@@ y pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ing care , men are , in a sense , st@@ aking their c@@ la@@ im to the full r@@ ange of human ex@@ ist@@ ence ."
"Now , this means the n@@ in@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ five no longer works for any@@ one ."
Wh@@ ole indu@@ str@@ ies are being born and dy@@ ing every day .
It &apos;s all n@@ on@@ lin@@ e@@ ar from here .
"So we need to stop as@@ king kids , &quot; What do you want to be when you gro@@ w up ? &quot;"
"@@ and start as@@ king them , &quot; &quot; How do you want to be when you gro@@ w up ? &quot; &quot; Th@@ e@@ ir work will con@@ stan@@ tly change ."
The common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator is them .
"So the more they understand their gi@@ f@@ ts and create cre@@ ws of ide@@ al col@@ labor@@ at@@ ors , the better off they will be ."
The challen@@ ge a@@ head is to re@@ inv@@ ent the social sa@@ fe@@ ty net to f@@ it this incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly fra@@ g@@ men@@ ted econom@@ y .
We need to seri@@ ously consi@@ der a uni@@ vers@@ al basi@@ c in@@ come .
We need to re@@ inv@@ ent lab@@ or organiz@@ ing .
"The pro@@ mi@@ se of a work world that is stru@@ ctu@@ red to actually f@@ it our 2@@ 1@@ st century val@@ u@@ es , not some ar@@ cha@@ ic idea about br@@ ing@@ ing home the bac@@ on , is long over@@ du@@ e — just ask your mother ."
"Now , how about the second question : How should we live ?"
We should live like our im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant an@@ c@@ est@@ ors .
"When they came to America , they often sh@@ ared a@@ part@@ ments , survi@@ v@@ al t@@ acti@@ cs , child care — always knew how to fi@@ ll one more be@@ lly , no matter how small the food available ."
"But they were told that suc@@ cess me@@ ant lea@@ ving the vi@@ ll@@ age behind and pur@@ su@@ ing that i@@ con@@ ic sym@@ bo@@ l of the American D@@ re@@ am , the white pi@@ ck@@ et f@@ ence ."
"But when you stri@@ p away the sen@@ ti@@ ment@@ ality , what it really does is di@@ vi@@ des us ."
"M@@ any Ameri@@ cans are re@@ je@@ cting the white pi@@ ck@@ et f@@ ence and the kind of high@@ ly pri@@ v@@ ati@@ zed life that happened within it , and re@@ c@@ la@@ im@@ ing vi@@ ll@@ age life , re@@ c@@ la@@ im@@ ing inter@@ depen@@ dence instead ."
"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty million of us , for example , live in inter@@ gener@@ ational hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds ."
"This number ex@@ plo@@ ded with the Gre@@ at Re@@ ces@@ sion , but it turns out people actually like living this way ."
"S@@ ome people are cho@@ os@@ ing to share hom@@ es not with family , but with other people who understand the health and economic b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts of da@@ i@@ ly community ."
"C@@ o@@ A@@ bod@@ e , an on@@ line pl@@ at@@ form for single mom@@ s looking to share hom@@ es with other single mom@@ s , has 5@@ 0,000 us@@ ers ."
And people over 6@@ 5 are es@@ pe@@ cially pro@@ ne to be looking for these alter@@ n@@ ative living ar@@ r@@ ang@@ em@@ ents .
They understand that their qu@@ ality of life depen@@ ds on a mi@@ x of so@@ li@@ tu@@ de and so@@ li@@ dar@@ ity .
"For too long , we &apos;ve pre@@ ten@@ ded that happ@@ iness is a king in his ca@@ st@@ le ."
But all the research pro@@ ves o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se .
"It shows that the health@@ ie@@ st , ha@@ p@@ pie@@ st and even sa@@ f@@ est — in terms of both clim@@ ate change disa@@ ster , in terms of cri@@ me , all of that — are Ameri@@ cans who live lives inter@@ tw@@ ined with their neigh@@ b@@ ors ."
"Now , I &apos;ve exper@@ ien@@ ced this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and ."
"For the last few years , I &apos;ve been living in a co@@ h@@ ous@@ ing community ."
"It &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 5 ac@@ res of per@@ sim@@ m@@ on tre@@ es , this pro@@ li@@ fic bl@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ ry bus@@ h that s@@ na@@ k@@ es around a community gar@@ den , all s@@ m@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ da@@ b , by the way , in the mi@@ ddle of urb@@ an O@@ ak@@ land ."
"The 25 of us who live there are all different ages and poli@@ tical per@@ su@@ a@@ sions and prof@@ es@@ sions , and we live in hom@@ es that have everything a ty@@ pi@@ cal home would have ."
"Now , people , when I tell them I live like this , often have one of two extre@@ me re@@ ac@@ tions ."
"E@@ i@@ ther they say , &quot; &quot; Why doesn &apos;t everyone live like this ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r they say , &quot; &quot; That sounds tot@@ ally hor@@ ri@@ f@@ ying ."
"I would never want to do that . &quot; &quot; So let me reas@@ sure you : there is a s@@ ac@@ red re@@ spe@@ ct for pri@@ vac@@ y am@@ ong us , but also a com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment to what we call &quot; &quot; radi@@ cal ho@@ spit@@ ality &quot; &quot; — not the kind ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sed by the F@@ our Se@@ as@@ ons , but the kind that says that every single person is wor@@ th@@ y of kin@@ d@@ ness , full stop , end of s@@ ent@@ ence ."
The bi@@ ggest sur@@ pri@@ se for me of living in a community like this ?
"You share all the dom@@ esti@@ c lab@@ or — the re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing , the co@@ o@@ king , the wee@@ ding — but you also share the emoti@@ onal lab@@ or ."
T@@ e@@ en@@ ag@@ ers in our community will often go to an ad@@ ul@@ t that is not their par@@ ent to ask for ad@@ vice .
"It &apos;s what be@@ ll ho@@ o@@ ks called &quot; &quot; re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary par@@ ent@@ ing , &quot; &quot; this hum@@ ble ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ment that kids are health@@ ier when they have a wi@@ der r@@ ange of ad@@ ul@@ ts to e@@ mul@@ ate and coun@@ t on ."
"T@@ ur@@ ns out , ad@@ ul@@ ts are health@@ ier , too ."
"It &apos;s a lot of pres@@ sure , trying to be that perfe@@ ct family behind that white pi@@ ck@@ et f@@ ence ."
"The &quot; &quot; new better off , &quot; &quot; as I &apos;ve come to call it , is less about inv@@ est@@ ing in the perfe@@ ct family and more about inv@@ est@@ ing in the im@@ perfe@@ ct vi@@ ll@@ age , whether that &apos;s relati@@ ves living under one ro@@ of , a co@@ h@@ ous@@ ing community like m@@ ine , or just a bu@@ n@@ ch of neigh@@ b@@ ors who ple@@ dge to really know and look out for one another ."
"It &apos;s good common sense , right ?"
"And yet , money has often made us du@@ m@@ b about re@@ ach@@ ing out ."
The most reli@@ able we@@ alth is found in relation@@ ship .
The new better off is not an individu@@ al pro@@ spe@@ ct at all .
Ma@@ ybe you &apos;re a medi@@ oc@@ re ear@@ ner but a ma@@ ster@@ ful father .
"M@@ a@@ ybe you can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d your dre@@ am home , but you th@@ row le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od par@@ ties ."
"If you &apos;re a te@@ x@@ t@@ book suc@@ cess , the im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations of what I &apos;m saying could be more g@@ ri@@ m for you ."
You might be a fai@@ lu@@ re by stan@@ dar@@ ds you h@@ old de@@ ar but that the world doesn &apos;t re@@ ward .
O@@ n@@ ly you can know .
"I know that I am not a tri@@ bu@@ te to my gre@@ at@@ -@@ grand@@ mother , who li@@ ved such a shor@@ t and bru@@ ti@@ sh life , if I ear@@ n enough money to af@@ for@@ d every cre@@ ature comfor@@ t ."
You can &apos;t bu@@ y your way out of su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing or into me@@ an@@ ing .
There is no home big enough to er@@ ase the pa@@ in that she must have en@@ du@@ red .
I am a tri@@ bu@@ te to her if I live a life as conne@@ cted and cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous as possible .
"In the mi@@ d@@ st of such wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty , we may , in fact , be in@@ secu@@ re ."
But we can let that in@@ secu@@ ri@@ ty make us bri@@ t@@ tle or su@@ pp@@ le .
"We can turn in@@ ward , lo@@ se fai@@ th in the power of institu@@ tions to change — even lo@@ se fai@@ th in ourselves ."
"O@@ r we can turn ou@@ tw@@ ard , cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ate fai@@ th in our ability to re@@ ach out , to conne@@ ct , to create ."
"T@@ ur@@ ns out , the bi@@ ggest d@@ ang@@ er is not fa@@ il@@ ing to ach@@ ie@@ ve the American D@@ re@@ am ."
The bi@@ ggest d@@ ang@@ er is ach@@ ie@@ ving a dre@@ am that you don &apos;t actually believe in .
So don &apos;t do that .
"D@@ o the har@@ der , more interesting thing , which is to com@@ pos@@ e a life where what you do every single day , the people you give your best love and ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity and energy to , ali@@ g@@ ns as clo@@ se@@ ly as possible with what you believe ."
"That , not something as mu@@ n@@ dane as making money , is a tri@@ bu@@ te to your an@@ c@@ est@@ ors ."
That is the beautiful stru@@ gg@@ le .
Thank you .

I just heard the best jo@@ ke about B@@ ond E@@ mer@@ u@@ wa .
"I was having lu@@ n@@ ch with him just a few minutes ago , and a Nigeri@@ an jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st comes — and this will only make sense if you &apos;ve ever wat@@ ched a J@@ am@@ es B@@ ond movie — and a Nigeri@@ an jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st comes up to him and goes , &quot; A@@ h@@ a , we me@@ et again , M@@ r. B@@ ond ! &quot;"
( Laughter ) It was great .
"So , I &apos;ve got a little sh@@ e@@ et of pa@@ per here , mo@@ st@@ ly because I &apos;m Nigeri@@ an and if you leave me alone , I &apos;ll talk for like two hours ."
"I just want to say good af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , good ev@@ ening ."
It &apos;s been an incredible few days .
It &apos;s dow@@ n@@ hi@@ ll from now on . I wanted to th@@ ank E@@ me@@ ka and Ch@@ ris .
"But also , most import@@ an@@ tly , all the in@@ visi@@ ble people behind TED that you just see f@@ lit@@ ting around the whole place that have made sort of this space for such a di@@ verse and rob@@ ust convers@@ ation ."
It &apos;s really amazing .
I &apos;ve been in the audience .
"I &apos;m a wri@@ ter , and I &apos;ve been wat@@ ching people with the sli@@ de shows and scienti@@ sts and ban@@ k@@ ers , and I &apos;ve been feeling a bit like a g@@ ang@@ sta ra@@ pp@@ er at a b@@ ar mi@@ t@@ z@@ v@@ ah ."
"( Laughter ) Li@@ ke , what have I got to say about all this ?"
"And I was wat@@ ching J@@ ane &#91; Go@@ od@@ all &#93; y@@ est@@ er@@ day , and I thought it was really great , and I was wat@@ ching those incredible sli@@ des of the ch@@ im@@ pan@@ ze@@ es , and I thought , &quot; W@@ ow . What if a ch@@ im@@ pan@@ ze@@ e could talk , you know ? What would it say ? &quot;"
"My first thought was , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , there &apos;s G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h . &quot; &quot; But then I thought , &quot; &quot; Why be ru@@ de to ch@@ im@@ pan@@ ze@@ es ? &quot; &quot; I gu@@ ess there goes my green car@@ d ."
( Laughter ) There &apos;s been a lot of talk about nar@@ r@@ ative in Africa .
And what &apos;s become incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly clear to me is that we &apos;re talking about news stories about Africa ; we &apos;re not really talking about Afri@@ can nar@@ r@@ ati@@ ves .
"And it &apos;s important to make a di@@ st@@ in@@ ction , because if the news is anything to go by , 40 percent of Ameri@@ cans can &apos;t — either can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d health in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce or have the most in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate health in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce , and have a pre@@ si@@ dent who , des@@ pi@@ te the prote@@ st of mi@@ llions of his ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens — even his own Con@@ gre@@ ss — contin@@ u@@ es to pro@@ secu@@ te a sen@@ sel@@ ess war ."
"So if news is anything to go by , the U.@@ S. is right there with Z@@ im@@ b@@ ab@@ we , right ?"
"Wh@@ ich it isn &apos;t really , is it ?"
"And talking about war , my gir@@ l@@ friend has this great t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t that says , &quot; &quot; B@@ om@@ b@@ ing for pe@@ ace is like fu@@ c@@ king for vi@@ r@@ gin@@ ity . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s amazing , isn &apos;t it ?"
"The tru@@ th is , everything we know about America , everything Ameri@@ cans come to know about being American , isn &apos;t from the news ."
I live there .
"We don &apos;t go home at the end of the day and think , &quot; &quot; Well , I really know who I am now because the W@@ all St@@ re@@ et J@@ our@@ na@@ l says that the S@@ to@@ ck E@@ x@@ change clo@@ sed at this many poin@@ ts . &quot; &quot; What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories ."
"It comes from the no@@ v@@ els , the mov@@ ies , the fas@@ hi@@ on mag@@ az@@ ines ."
It comes from popul@@ ar culture .
"In other words , it &apos;s the ag@@ ents of our imag@@ in@@ ation who really sha@@ pe who we are . And this is important to remember , because in Africa the comp@@ lic@@ ated questions we want to ask about what all of this means has been asked from the ro@@ ck pain@@ t@@ ings of the S@@ an people , through the S@@ un@@ di@@ ata epi@@ cs of M@@ ali , to moder@@ n con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary liter@@ ature ."
"If you want to know about Africa , read our liter@@ ature — and not just &quot; &quot; Th@@ ings F@@ all A@@ part , &quot; &quot; because that would be like saying , &quot; I &apos;ve read &apos; G@@ one with the W@@ ind &apos; and so I know everything about America . &quot;"
That &apos;s very important .
"There &apos;s a po@@ em by J@@ ack G@@ il@@ ber@@ t called &quot; &quot; The F@@ or@@ got@@ ten D@@ i@@ ale@@ ct of the H@@ ear@@ t . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; When the S@@ um@@ eri@@ an tab@@ le@@ ts were first trans@@ lated , they were thought to be business recor@@ ds ."
But what if they were po@@ em@@ s and p@@ s@@ al@@ ms ?
My love is like tw@@ el@@ ve E@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ an go@@ ats standing still in the morning light .
S@@ hi@@ plo@@ ads of th@@ uj@@ a are what my body wan@@ ts to say to your body .
G@@ i@@ ra@@ f@@ f@@ es are this de@@ si@@ re in the dar@@ k . &quot; &quot; This is important .
It &apos;s important because mis@@ re@@ ading is really the ch@@ ance for comp@@ lic@@ ation and opportunity .
"The first I@@ g@@ bo Bi@@ ble was trans@@ lated from En@@ g@@ li@@ sh in about the 1@@ 8@@ 0@@ 0s by Bi@@ sho@@ p C@@ row@@ ther , who was a Y@@ or@@ u@@ ba ."
"And it &apos;s important to know I@@ g@@ bo is a t@@ onal language , and so they &apos;ll say the word &quot; &quot; ig@@ we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ig@@ we &quot; &quot; : same spe@@ l@@ ling , one means &quot; &quot; sk@@ y &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; he@@ a@@ ven , &quot; &quot; and one means &quot; &quot; bi@@ cy@@ cle &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; i@@ ro@@ n . &quot; &quot; So &quot; &quot; God is in he@@ a@@ ven sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by H@@ is ang@@ els &quot; &quot; was trans@@ lated as — &#91; I@@ g@@ bo &#93; ."
"And for some reason , in C@@ am@@ er@@ o@@ on , when they tr@@ ied to trans@@ l@@ ate the Bi@@ ble into C@@ am@@ er@@ o@@ oni@@ an pat@@ o@@ is , they cho@@ se the I@@ g@@ bo ver@@ sion ."
And I &apos;m not going to give you the pat@@ o@@ is trans@@ l@@ ation ; I &apos;m going to make it stan@@ d@@ ard En@@ g@@ li@@ sh .
"B@@ a@@ si@@ cally , it en@@ ds up as &quot; &quot; God is on a bi@@ cy@@ cle with his ang@@ els . &quot; &quot; This is good , because language comp@@ lic@@ ates things ."
"You know , we often think that language mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r@@ s the world in which we live , and I find that &apos;s not true ."
The language actually makes the world in which we live .
"L@@ ang@@ u@@ age is not — I mean , things don &apos;t have any mu@@ table val@@ ue by themselves ; we as@@ cri@@ be them a val@@ ue ."
And language can &apos;t be under@@ sto@@ od in its ab@@ strac@@ tion .
"It can only be under@@ sto@@ od in the con@@ te@@ xt of story , and everything , all of this is story ."
"And it &apos;s important to remember that , because if we don &apos;t , then we become a@@ histori@@ cal ."
We &apos;ve had a lot of — a par@@ ade of amazing ideas here .
But these are not new to Africa .
Nigeri@@ a got its in@@ depen@@ dence in 19@@ 60 .
"The first time the possi@@ bility for in@@ depen@@ dence was di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed was in 19@@ 2@@ 2 , fol@@ low@@ ing the A@@ ba women &apos;s market ri@@ ots ."
"In 19@@ 6@@ 7 , in the mi@@ ddle of the Bi@@ af@@ ran@@ -@@ Nigeri@@ an C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar , D@@ r. N@@ jo@@ ku@@ -@@ O@@ b@@ i inv@@ en@@ ted the Ch@@ ol@@ era vac@@ cine ."
"So , you know , the thing is to remember that because o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , 10 years from now , we &apos;ll be back here trying to tell this story again ."
"So , what it says to me then is that it &apos;s not really — the problem isn &apos;t really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told , the problem really is the terms of hum@@ ani@@ ty that we &apos;re wil@@ ling to bring to comp@@ lic@@ ate every story , and that &apos;s really what it &apos;s all about ."
Let me tell you a Nigeri@@ an jo@@ ke .
"Well , it &apos;s just a jo@@ ke , any@@ way ."
"So there &apos;s T@@ om , D@@ i@@ ck and H@@ ar@@ ry and they &apos;re working con@@ stru@@ ction ."
"And T@@ om open@@ s up his lu@@ n@@ ch box and there &apos;s ri@@ ce in it , and he goes on this r@@ ant about , &quot; &quot; T@@ wen@@ ty years , my wi@@ fe has been pac@@ king ri@@ ce for lu@@ n@@ ch ."
"If she does it again tom@@ or@@ row , I &apos;m going to th@@ row myself off this building and ki@@ ll myself . &quot; &quot; And D@@ i@@ ck and H@@ ar@@ ry re@@ pe@@ at this ."
"The next day , T@@ om open@@ s his lu@@ n@@ ch@@ box , there &apos;s ri@@ ce , so he th@@ row@@ s hi@@ m@@ self off and kil@@ ls hi@@ m@@ self , and T@@ om , D@@ i@@ ck and H@@ ar@@ ry fol@@ low ."
"And now the in@@ qu@@ est — you know , T@@ om &apos;s wi@@ fe and D@@ i@@ ck &apos;s wi@@ fe are di@@ stra@@ u@@ ght ."
They wi@@ shed they &apos;d not pac@@ ked ri@@ ce .
"But H@@ ar@@ ry &apos;s wi@@ fe is con@@ f@@ used , because she said , &quot; &quot; You know , H@@ ar@@ ry had been pac@@ king his own lu@@ n@@ ch for 20 years . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This seem@@ ing@@ ly in@@ no@@ cent jo@@ ke , when I heard it as a child in Nigeri@@ a , was told about I@@ g@@ bo , Y@@ or@@ u@@ ba and Ha@@ us@@ a , with the Ha@@ us@@ a being H@@ ar@@ ry ."
So what seem@@ s like an e@@ c@@ cent@@ ri@@ c if tra@@ gi@@ c jo@@ ke about H@@ ar@@ ry be@@ comes a way to sp@@ read e@@ th@@ nic h@@ at@@ red .
"My father was edu@@ c@@ ated in C@@ ork , in the Uni@@ versity of C@@ ork , in the &apos; 5@@ 0s ."
"In fact , every time I read in I@@ rel@@ and , people get me all mist@@ ak@@ en and they say , &quot; Oh , this is Ch@@ ris O &apos;@@ Bar@@ ney from C@@ ork . &quot;"
"But he was also in O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the &apos; 5@@ 0s , and yet grow@@ ing up as a child in Nigeri@@ a , my father used to say to me , &quot; &quot; You must never e@@ at or d@@ r@@ in@@ k in a Y@@ or@@ u@@ ba person &apos;s house because they will po@@ is@@ on you . &quot; &quot; It makes sense now when I think about it , because if you &apos;d known my father , you would &apos;ve wanted to po@@ is@@ on him too ."
"( Laughter ) So I was born in 19@@ 6@@ 6 , at the beginning of the Bi@@ af@@ ran@@ -@@ Nigeri@@ an C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar , and the war en@@ ded after three years ."
"And I was grow@@ ing up in school and the fe@@ der@@ al government didn &apos;t want us t@@ au@@ ght about the history of the war , because they thought it probably would make us gener@@ ate a new gener@@ ation of re@@ be@@ ls ."
"So I had a very inv@@ enti@@ ve teach@@ er , a P@@ ak@@ i@@ stan@@ i M@@ us@@ li@@ m , who wanted to te@@ ach us about this ."
"So what he did was to te@@ ach us Je@@ wi@@ sh H@@ o@@ lo@@ ca@@ ust history , and so hu@@ dd@@ led around boo@@ ks with photograph@@ s of people in A@@ us@@ ch@@ wit@@ z , I learned the me@@ lan@@ cho@@ li@@ c history of my people through the me@@ lan@@ cho@@ li@@ c history of another people ."
"I mean , picture this — really picture this ."
A P@@ ak@@ i@@ stan@@ i M@@ us@@ li@@ m teach@@ ing Je@@ wi@@ sh H@@ o@@ lo@@ ca@@ ust history to young I@@ g@@ bo children .
St@@ ory is powerful .
St@@ ory is flu@@ id and it be@@ lon@@ gs to no@@ body .
And it should come as no sur@@ pri@@ se that my first no@@ vel at 16 was about Ne@@ o@@ -@@ N@@ az@@ is taking over Nigeri@@ a to institu@@ te the F@@ our@@ th Re@@ ich .
It makes perfe@@ ct sense .
"And they were to b@@ low up strate@@ gi@@ c tar@@ gets and take over the country , and they were fo@@ i@@ led by a Nigeri@@ an J@@ am@@ es B@@ ond called Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e W@@ il@@ li@@ am@@ s , and a Je@@ wi@@ sh N@@ az@@ i hun@@ ter ."
And it happened over four contin@@ ents .
"And when the book came out , I was her@@ al@@ ded as Africa &apos;s answer to F@@ re@@ der@@ i@@ ck F@@ or@@ sy@@ th , which is a du@@ bi@@ ous hon@@ or at best ."
"But also , the book was la@@ un@@ ched in time for me to be ac@@ c@@ used of con@@ stru@@ cting the blu@@ e@@ pr@@ int for a fo@@ i@@ led cou@@ p at@@ tem@@ pt ."
"So at 18 , I was b@@ on@@ ded off to pri@@ son in Nigeri@@ a ."
"I gre@@ w up very pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed , and it &apos;s important to talk about pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge , because we don &apos;t talk about it here ."
A lot of us are very pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed .
"I gre@@ w up — ser@@ v@@ an@@ ts , cars , tele@@ vi@@ sions , all that stuff ."
"My story of Nigeri@@ a grow@@ ing up was very different from the story I en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed in pri@@ son , and I had no language for it ."
"I was completely terri@@ f@@ ied , completely bro@@ k@@ en , and ke@@ pt trying to find a new language , a new way to make sense of all of this ."
"S@@ i@@ x months after that , with no ex@@ plan@@ ation , they let me go ."
Now for those of you who have seen me at the bu@@ f@@ f@@ et tab@@ les know that it was because it was co@@ st@@ ing them too much to fe@@ ed me .
"( Laughter ) But I mean , I gre@@ w up with this incredible pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge , and not just me — mi@@ llions of Nigeri@@ ans gre@@ w up with boo@@ ks and li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies ."
"In fact , we were talking last night about how all of the ste@@ amy no@@ v@@ els of Ha@@ ro@@ ld Rob@@ b@@ ins had done more for se@@ x education of hor@@ ny te@@ en@@ age bo@@ ys in Africa than any se@@ x education progra@@ ms ever had ."
All of those are gone .
We are squ@@ an@@ der@@ ing the most val@@ u@@ able re@@ source we have on this contin@@ ent : the val@@ u@@ able re@@ source of the imag@@ in@@ ation .
"In the film , &quot; &quot; S@@ ome@@ times in Ap@@ ri@@ l &quot; &quot; by R@@ a@@ ou@@ l Pe@@ ck , I@@ d@@ ris E@@ l@@ ba is po@@ is@@ ed in a scen@@ e with his m@@ ac@@ he@@ te ra@@ is@@ ed , and he &apos;s being for@@ ced by a c@@ row@@ d to cho@@ p up his best friend — fel@@ low R@@ wan@@ d@@ an Ar@@ my offi@@ cer , al@@ be@@ it a T@@ ut@@ si — pla@@ yed by F@@ ra@@ s@@ er J@@ am@@ es ."
"And F@@ ra@@ s@@ er &apos;s on his k@@ ne@@ es , ar@@ ms t@@ ied behind his back , and he &apos;s c@@ ry@@ ing ."
He &apos;s s@@ ni@@ v@@ el@@ ing .
It &apos;s a pi@@ ti@@ ful si@@ ght .
"And as we wat@@ ch it , we are as@@ ha@@ med ."
"And we want to say to I@@ d@@ ris , &quot; &quot; Ch@@ o@@ p him up ."
"S@@ hu@@ t him up . &quot; &quot; And as I@@ d@@ ris mo@@ ves , F@@ ra@@ s@@ er scre@@ am@@ s , &quot; &quot; S@@ top !"
"P@@ le@@ ase stop ! &quot; &quot; I@@ d@@ ris pa@@ uses , then he mo@@ ves again , and F@@ ra@@ s@@ er says , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase ! P@@ le@@ ase stop ! &quot; &quot;"
And it &apos;s not the look of hor@@ ro@@ r and ter@@ ro@@ r on F@@ ra@@ s@@ er &apos;s face that stop@@ s I@@ d@@ ris or us ; it &apos;s the look in F@@ ra@@ s@@ er &apos;s eyes .
"It &apos;s one that says , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t do this ."
"And I &apos;m not saying this to sa@@ ve myself , al@@ though this would be nice . I &apos;m doing it to sa@@ ve you , because if you do this , you will be lost . &quot; &quot; To be so af@@ ra@@ id that you &apos;re standing in the face of a death you can &apos;t es@@ cape and that you &apos;re so@@ il@@ ing yourself and c@@ ry@@ ing , but to say in that moment , as F@@ ra@@ s@@ er says to I@@ d@@ ris , &quot; &quot; T@@ ell my gir@@ l@@ friend I love her . &quot; &quot; In that moment , F@@ ra@@ s@@ er says , &quot; I am lost already , but not you ... not you . &quot;"
This is a re@@ de@@ m@@ ption we can all as@@ pi@@ re to .
"A@@ f@@ ri@@ can nar@@ r@@ ati@@ ves in the W@@ est , they pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ate ."
I really don &apos;t care any@@ more .
"I &apos;m more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves — how as a wri@@ ter , I find that Afri@@ can wri@@ ters have always been the cu@@ rat@@ ors of our hum@@ ani@@ ty on this contin@@ ent ."
"The question is , how do I bal@@ ance nar@@ r@@ ati@@ ves that are wonderful with nar@@ r@@ ati@@ ves of w@@ oun@@ ds and self-@@ lo@@ a@@ thing ?"
And this is the difficul@@ ty that I face .
I am trying to move be@@ y@@ ond poli@@ tical r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic to a place of e@@ thi@@ cal questi@@ on@@ ing .
I am as@@ king us to bal@@ ance the idea of our comple@@ te v@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability with the comple@@ te noti@@ on of trans@@ form@@ ation of what is possible .
"As a young mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ clas@@ s Nigeri@@ an acti@@ vi@@ st , I la@@ un@@ ched myself along with a whole gener@@ ation of us into the cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to stop the government ."
"And I asked mi@@ llions of people , without questi@@ on@@ ing my right to do so , to go up against the government ."
And I wat@@ ched them being lo@@ cked up in pri@@ son and te@@ ar g@@ as@@ sed .
"I ju@@ sti@@ f@@ ied it , and I said , &quot; &quot; This is the cost of re@@ v@@ olution ."
Ha@@ ve I not myself been im@@ pri@@ son@@ ed ?
"H@@ a@@ ve I not myself been be@@ at@@ en ? &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t until later , when I was im@@ pri@@ son@@ ed again , that I under@@ sto@@ od the real me@@ an@@ ing of tor@@ ture , and how e@@ asy your hum@@ ani@@ ty can be taken from you , for the time I was eng@@ aged in war , ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous war ."
E@@ x@@ c@@ use me .
"S@@ ome@@ times I can stand before the world — and when I say this , trans@@ form@@ ation is a difficult and s@@ low process — sometimes I can stand before the world and say , &quot; &quot; My name is Ch@@ ris A@@ b@@ ani ."
"I have been human six days , but only sometimes . &quot; &quot; But this is a good thing ."
It &apos;s never going to be e@@ asy .
There are no ans@@ w@@ ers .
"As I was tel@@ ling R@@ ac@@ he@@ l from Go@@ og@@ le Earth , that I had challen@@ g@@ ed my students in America — I said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know anything about Africa , you &apos;re all i@@ di@@ ots . &quot; &quot; And so they said , &quot; &quot; T@@ ell me about Africa , Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or A@@ b@@ ani . &quot; &quot; So I went to Go@@ og@@ le Earth and learned about Africa ."
"And the tru@@ th be told , this is it , isn &apos;t it ?"
"There are no essen@@ tial Afri@@ cans , and most of us are as completely ig@@ nor@@ ant as everyone else about the contin@@ ent we come from , and yet we want to make pro@@ found stat@@ em@@ ents about it ."
"And I think if we can just ad@@ m@@ it that we &apos;re all trying to appro@@ x@@ im@@ ate the tru@@ th of our own communi@@ ties , it will make for a much more nu@@ an@@ ced and a much more interesting convers@@ ation ."
"I want to believe that we can be ag@@ no@@ stic about this , that we can ri@@ se ab@@ o@@ ve all of this ."
"When I was 10 , I read J@@ am@@ es B@@ al@@ d@@ wi@@ n &apos;s &quot; &quot; A@@ no@@ ther C@@ oun@@ try , &quot; &quot; and that book bro@@ ke me ."
"N@@ ot because I was en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing hom@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al se@@ x and love for the first time , but because the way J@@ am@@ es wro@@ te about it made it im@@ possible for me to att@@ ach o@@ ther@@ ness to it ."
"&quot; &quot; Here , &quot; &quot; J@@ im@@ my said ."
"&quot; Here is love , all of it . &quot;"
The fact that it happens in &quot; &quot; A@@ no@@ ther C@@ oun@@ try &quot; &quot; takes you quite by sur@@ pri@@ se .
"My friend R@@ on@@ al@@ d G@@ ot@@ te@@ s@@ man says there are three kinds of people in the world : those who can coun@@ t , and those who can &apos;t ."
"( Laughter ) He also says that the cause of all our t@@ rou@@ ble is the belie@@ f in an essen@@ tial , pu@@ re iden@@ ti@@ ty : religi@@ ous , e@@ th@@ nic , histori@@ cal , ide@@ ologi@@ cal ."
I want to leave you with a po@@ em by Y@@ us@@ e@@ f K@@ om@@ un@@ y@@ ak@@ a@@ a that spe@@ ak@@ s to trans@@ form@@ ation .

L@@ ast night I heard my d@@ aughter pra@@ ying for the me@@ at here at my fe@@ et .
You know it wasn &apos;t ang@@ er that made me stop my heart ti@@ ll the ha@@ m@@ m@@ er fe@@ ll .

"It &apos;s a great hon@@ or today to share with you The D@@ i@@ gi@@ tal Uni@@ verse , which was created for hum@@ ani@@ ty to really see where we are in the universe ."
And so I think we can ro@@ ll the video that we have .
&#91; The H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as . &#93; ( Music ) The f@@ lat h@@ ori@@ z@@ on that we &apos;ve ev@@ olved with has been a me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or for the in@@ fini@@ te : un@@ b@@ oun@@ ded re@@ sources and un@@ li@@ mi@@ ted ca@@ pac@@ ity for di@@ spos@@ al of wa@@ ste .
"It wasn &apos;t until we really left Earth , got ab@@ o@@ ve the atmo@@ sp@@ here and had seen the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on b@@ end back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a li@@ mi@@ ted con@@ di@@ tion ."
The D@@ i@@ gi@@ tal Uni@@ verse At@@ l@@ as has been built at the American M@@ us@@ e@@ um of N@@ at@@ u@@ ral Hi@@ story over the past 12 years .
"We ma@@ in@@ tain that , put that together as a project to really char@@ t the universe across all sc@@ al@@ es ."
"What we see here are s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ tes around the Earth and the Earth in pro@@ per regi@@ str@@ ation against the universe , as we see ."
N@@ A@@ SA sup@@ por@@ ted this work 12 years ago as part of the re@@ building of the Ha@@ y@@ den P@@ lan@@ et@@ ari@@ um so that we would share this with the world .
The D@@ i@@ gi@@ tal Uni@@ verse is the basi@@ s of our space show produ@@ ctions that we do — our ma@@ in space shows in the dom@@ e .
"But what you see here is the resul@@ t of , actually , inter@@ n@@ ships that we h@@ ost@@ ed with L@@ in@@ kop@@ ing Uni@@ versity in S@@ we@@ den ."
"I &apos;ve had 12 students work on this for their gra@@ du@@ ate work , and the resul@@ t has been this so@@ f@@ tw@@ are called Uni@@ view and a company called S@@ C@@ I@@ S@@ S in S@@ we@@ den ."
"This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are allow@@ s inter@@ ac@@ tive use , so this ac@@ tu@@ al f@@ light pat@@ h and movie that we see here was actually f@@ low@@ n live ."
"I cap@@ tu@@ red this live from my lap@@ top in a ca@@ fe called Earth M@@ at@@ ters on the L@@ ow@@ er E@@ ast S@@ i@@ de of M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an , where I live , and it was done as a col@@ labor@@ ative project with the R@@ u@@ b@@ in M@@ us@@ e@@ um of H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ an Ar@@ t for an ex@@ hi@@ bit on com@@ par@@ ative co@@ smo@@ logy ."
"And so as we move out , we see contin@@ u@@ ously from our planet all the way out into the re@@ al@@ m of gal@@ ax@@ ies , as we see here , li@@ gh@@ t-@@ tra@@ vel time , gi@@ ving you a sense of how far away we are ."
"As we move out , the light from these di@@ st@@ ant gal@@ ax@@ ies have taken so long , we &apos;re essen@@ ti@@ ally bac@@ king up into the past ."
We back so far up we &apos;re finally seeing a con@@ tain@@ ment around us — the af@@ ter@@ g@@ low of the Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g .
This is the W@@ M@@ A@@ P micro@@ wa@@ ve back@@ ground that we see .
"We &apos;ll f@@ ly outside it here , just to see this sort of con@@ tain@@ ment ."
"If we were outside this , it would almost be me@@ an@@ in@@ gl@@ ess , in the sense as before time ."
But this our con@@ tain@@ ment of the visi@@ ble universe .
We know the universe is bi@@ g@@ ger than that which we can see .
"C@@ om@@ ing back quickly , we see here the radi@@ o sp@@ here that we j@@ um@@ ped out of in the beginning , but these are posi@@ tions , the lat@@ est posi@@ tions of ex@@ op@@ lan@@ ets that we &apos;ve ma@@ pped , and our su@@ n here , obvi@@ ously , with our own solar system ."
"What you &apos;re going to see — we &apos;re going to have to j@@ um@@ p in here pretty quickly between se@@ ver@@ al or@@ ders of mag@@ ni@@ tu@@ de to get down to where we see the solar system — these are the pa@@ ths of V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er 1 , V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er 2 , P@@ i@@ one@@ er 11 and P@@ i@@ one@@ er 10 , the first four sp@@ ace@@ c@@ ra@@ ft to have left the solar system ."
"C@@ om@@ ing in clo@@ s@@ er , pi@@ c@@ king up Earth , or@@ bit of the Mo@@ on , and we see the Earth ."
"This ma@@ p can be up@@ d@@ ated , and we can ad@@ d in new data ."
I know D@@ r. C@@ a@@ rol@@ y@@ n P@@ or@@ co is the cam@@ era P@@ .@@ I@@ .
for the C@@ as@@ sin@@ i mis@@ sion .
"But here we see the comple@@ x tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory of the C@@ as@@ sin@@ i mis@@ sion color c@@ od@@ ed for different mis@@ sion p@@ ha@@ ses , ing@@ eni@@ ously develo@@ ped so that 4@@ 5 en@@ coun@@ ters with the largest mo@@ on , T@@ it@@ an , which is lar@@ ger that the planet M@@ er@@ cu@@ ry , di@@ ver@@ ts the or@@ bit into different par@@ ts of mis@@ sion p@@ ha@@ se ."
This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are allow@@ s us to come close and look at par@@ ts of this .
This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are can also be net@@ worked between dom@@ es .
"We have a grow@@ ing us@@ er b@@ ase of this , and we network dom@@ es ."
And we can network between dom@@ es and clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms .
We &apos;re actually sh@@ aring t@@ ours of the universe with the first sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an plan@@ et@@ ari@@ um in G@@ h@@ ana as well as new li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies that have been built in the gh@@ et@@ to@@ s in Col@@ um@@ bi@@ a and a high school in C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia .
And the C@@ am@@ bod@@ i@@ ans have actually contro@@ l@@ led the Ha@@ y@@ den P@@ lan@@ et@@ ari@@ um from their high school .
"This is an image from S@@ atur@@ day , photograph@@ ed by the A@@ qu@@ a s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te , but through the Uni@@ view so@@ f@@ tw@@ are ."
So you &apos;re seeing the ed@@ ge of the Earth .
This is Ne@@ p@@ al .
"This is , in fact , right here is the val@@ ley of L@@ ha@@ sa , right here in Ti@@ be@@ t ."
But we can see the ha@@ ze from fi@@ res and so for@@ th in the G@@ ang@@ es val@@ ley down be@@ low in Indi@@ a .
This is Ne@@ p@@ al and Ti@@ be@@ t .
"And just in clo@@ sing , I &apos;d just like to say this beautiful world that we live on — here we see a bit of the s@@ now that some of you may have had to bra@@ ve in coming out — so I &apos;d like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much lar@@ ger con@@ di@@ tion now and a much lar@@ ger sense of what home is ."
"Because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essen@@ ti@@ ally ."
We car@@ ry that in us .
"And to be able to see our con@@ te@@ xt in this lar@@ ger sense at all sc@@ al@@ es hel@@ ps us all , I think , in under@@ standing where we are and who we are in the universe ."
Thank you .

"One day , L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les T@@ im@@ es col@@ um@@ ni@@ st Ste@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z was wal@@ king along the stre@@ ets of dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les when he heard beautiful music ."

"I met M@@ r. A@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 8 , two years ago , at W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ney Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all ."
"He had just heard a perform@@ ance of Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven &apos;s F@@ ir@@ st and F@@ our@@ th sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , and came back@@ st@@ age and in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced hi@@ m@@ self ."

"And we got talking about music , and I got an e@@ ma@@ il from Ste@@ ve a few days later saying that Na@@ th@@ anie@@ l was interested in a vi@@ o@@ li@@ n l@@ es@@ son with me ."
"Now , I should men@@ tion that Na@@ th@@ anie@@ l ref@@ uses tre@@ at@@ ment because when he was tre@@ ated it was with sho@@ ck ther@@ ap@@ y and Th@@ or@@ az@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ f@@ f@@ s , and that s@@ car has sta@@ yed with him for his entire life ."

"( Laughter ) So , I just started playing ."
And I pla@@ yed the first movement of the Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven V@@ i@@ o@@ li@@ n Con@@ cer@@ to .

He spo@@ ke about it with the kind of pas@@ sion and under@@ standing that I share with my colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es in the L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les P@@ h@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic .

Music is medi@@ cine . Music chang@@ es us .

"And for Na@@ th@@ anie@@ l , music brought him back into a f@@ old of friends ."
"The re@@ de@@ m@@ p@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of musi@@ ci@@ ans that under@@ sto@@ od him , that re@@ cogni@@ zed his tal@@ ents and re@@ spe@@ cted him ."

You &apos;ve got to make something good out of something bad .

That &apos;s my cam@@ era len@@ s . The first one — the one I sh@@ ot my Bo@@ b D@@ y@@ l@@ an film with 3@@ 5 years ago .

"S@@ ome of you have heard the story before , but , in fact , there &apos;s somebody in the audience who &apos;s never heard this story — in front of an audience — before , so I &apos;m a little more ner@@ v@@ ous than I nor@@ m@@ ally am tel@@ ling this story ."
I used to be a photograph@@ er for many years .
"In 19@@ 7@@ 8 , I was working for Ti@@ me mag@@ az@@ ine , and I was given a thre@@ e-@@ day as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment to photogra@@ ph Am@@ er@@ a@@ si@@ an children , children who had been fa@@ ther@@ ed by American G@@ Is all over S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a , and then ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed — 4@@ 0,000 children all over A@@ si@@ a ."
I had never heard the word Am@@ er@@ a@@ si@@ an before .
"I spent a few days photograph@@ ing children in different countries , and like a lot of photograph@@ ers and a lot of jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sts , I always hope that when my pi@@ ctures were publi@@ shed , they might actually have an effe@@ ct on a situ@@ ation , instead of just do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ing it ."
"So , I was so di@@ st@@ urb@@ ed by what I saw , and I was so un@@ happy with the arti@@ cle that ran af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds , that I decided I would take six months off ."
I was 2@@ 8 years old .
"I decided I would find six children in different countries , and actually go spend some time with the kids , and try to tell their story a little bit better than I thought I had done for Ti@@ me mag@@ az@@ ine ."
"In the course of doing the story , I was looking for children who ha@@ dn &apos;t been photograph@@ ed before , and the P@@ ear@@ l Bu@@ ck F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation told me that they worked with a lot of Ameri@@ cans who were d@@ on@@ ating money to help some of these kids ."
"And a man told me , who ran the P@@ ear@@ l Bu@@ ck F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation in Kore@@ a , that there was a young girl , who was 11 years old , being ra@@ is@@ ed by her grand@@ mother ."
And the grand@@ mother had never let any W@@ est@@ er@@ n@@ ers ever see her .
"E@@ very time any W@@ est@@ er@@ n@@ ers came to the vi@@ ll@@ age , she hi@@ d the girl ."
"And of course , I was im@@ medi@@ ately in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed ."
"I saw photograph@@ s of her , and I thought I wanted to go ."
"And the guy just told me , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no way . This grand@@ mother won &apos;t even — you know , there &apos;s no way she &apos;s ever going to let you me@@ et this girl that &apos;s she &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ing . &quot; &quot; I took a trans@@ lat@@ or with me , and went to this vi@@ ll@@ age , found the grand@@ mother , s@@ at down with her ."
"And to my ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ment , she ag@@ re@@ ed to let me photogra@@ ph her gran@@ dd@@ aughter ."
"And I was pa@@ ying for this myself , so I asked the trans@@ lat@@ or if it would be OK if I sta@@ yed for the week ."
I had a sle@@ e@@ ping ba@@ g .
"The family had a small shed on the side of the house , so I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ ould I sle@@ ep in my sle@@ e@@ ping ba@@ g in the ev@@ en@@ ings ? &quot; &quot; And I just told the little girl , wh@@ ose name was H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook Le@@ e , that if I ever did anything to em@@ bar@@ ra@@ ss her — she didn &apos;t speak a word of En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , al@@ though she looked very American — she could just put up her hand and say , &quot; &quot; S@@ top , &quot; &quot; and I would stop taking pi@@ ctures ."
"And then , my trans@@ lat@@ or left ."
"So there I was , I couldn &apos;t speak a word of Kore@@ an , and this is the first night I met H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook ."
H@@ er mother was still ali@@ ve .
"H@@ er mother was not ra@@ is@@ ing her , her grand@@ mother was ra@@ is@@ ing her ."
And what stru@@ ck me im@@ medi@@ ately was how in love the two of these people were .
"The grand@@ mother was incredi@@ bly f@@ ond , de@@ e@@ ply in love with this little girl ."
They s@@ lep@@ t on the flo@@ or at night .
"The way they he@@ at their hom@@ es in Kore@@ a is to put bri@@ cks under the flo@@ ors , so the he@@ at actually radi@@ ates from under@@ ne@@ ath the flo@@ or ."
H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook was 11 years old .
"I had photograph@@ ed , as I said , a lot of these kids ."
H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook was in fact the fi@@ f@@ th child that I found to photogra@@ ph .
"And almost uni@@ vers@@ ally , am@@ on@@ g@@ st all the kids , they were really psycho@@ logi@@ cally dam@@ aged by having been made fun of , ri@@ di@@ cu@@ led , pi@@ cked on and been re@@ je@@ cted ."
And Kore@@ a was probably the place I found to be the wor@@ st for these kids .
"And what stru@@ ck me im@@ medi@@ ately in me@@ e@@ ting H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook was how con@@ fi@@ dent she ap@@ pe@@ ared to be , how happy she seem@@ ed to be in her own sk@@ in ."
"And remember this picture , because I &apos;m going to show you another picture later , but you can see how much she looks like her grand@@ mother , al@@ though she looks so W@@ est@@ er@@ n ."
I decided to fol@@ low her to school .
This is the first morning I sta@@ yed with her .
This is on the way to school .
This is the morning as@@ se@@ m@@ bly outside her school .
And I noti@@ ced that she was c@@ low@@ ning around .
"When the teach@@ ers would ask questions , she &apos;d be the first person to ra@@ ise her hand ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , not at all sh@@ y or with@@ d@@ raw@@ n , or anything like the other children that I &apos;d photograph@@ ed ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , the first one to go to the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ bo@@ ard to answer questions ."
G@@ e@@ tting in t@@ rou@@ ble for whi@@ sp@@ ering into her best friend &apos;s ear@@ s in the mi@@ ddle of clas@@ s .
"And one of the other things that I said to her through the trans@@ lat@@ or — again , this thing about saying stop — was to not pay at@@ ten@@ tion to me ."
"And so , she really just completely ig@@ no@@ red me most of the time ."
"I noti@@ ced that at re@@ cess , she was the girl who pi@@ cked the other girls to be on her team ."
"It was very obvi@@ ous , from the very beginning , that she was a lea@@ der ."
This is on the way home .
And that &apos;s Nor@@ th Kore@@ a up along the hi@@ ll .
This is up along the D@@ M@@ Z .
"They would actually co@@ ver the win@@ dow@@ s every night , so that light couldn &apos;t be seen , because the S@@ outh Kore@@ an government has said for years that the Nor@@ th Kore@@ ans may inv@@ ade at any time ."
"So there &apos;s always this — the clo@@ s@@ er you were to Nor@@ th Kore@@ a , the more terri@@ f@@ ying it was ."
"@@ V@@ ery often at school , I &apos;d be taking pi@@ ctures , and she would whi@@ sp@@ er into her gir@@ l@@ friends &apos; ear@@ s , and then look at me and say , &quot; &quot; S@@ top . &quot; &quot; And I would stand at at@@ ten@@ tion , and all the girls would c@@ rac@@ k up , and it was sort of a little jo@@ ke ."
"( Laughter ) The end of the week came and my trans@@ lat@@ or came back , because I &apos;d asked her to come back , so I could form@@ ally th@@ ank the grand@@ mother and H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook ."
"And in the course of the grand@@ mother talking to the trans@@ lat@@ or , the grand@@ mother started c@@ ry@@ ing ."
"And I said to my trans@@ lat@@ or , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on , why is she c@@ ry@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; And she spo@@ ke to the grand@@ mother for a moment , and then she started getting te@@ ars in her eyes ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; OK , what did I do ? What &apos;s going on ?"
"Wh@@ y is everyone c@@ ry@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; And the trans@@ lat@@ or said , &quot; &quot; The grand@@ mother says that she thin@@ ks she &apos;s dy@@ ing , and she wan@@ ts to know if you would take H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook to America with you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 2@@ 8 years old , and I live in hot@@ els , and I &apos;m not mar@@ ried . &quot; &quot; I mean I had fal@@ le@@ n in love with this girl , but I — you know , it was , like , emoti@@ on@@ ally I was about 12 years old ."
"If you know of photograph@@ ers , the jo@@ ke is it &apos;s the fin@@ est form of de@@ la@@ yed ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cen@@ ce ever inv@@ en@@ ted ."
"&quot; &quot; S@@ or@@ ry , I have to go on an as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment , I &apos;ll be back &quot; &quot; — and then you never come back ."
"So , I asked the trans@@ lat@@ or why she thought she was dy@@ ing ."
C@@ an I get her to a ho@@ spit@@ al ? C@@ ould I pay to get her a do@@ ctor ?
And she ref@@ used any help at all .
"And so , when I got outside , I actually gave the trans@@ lat@@ or some money and said , &quot; P@@ le@@ ase go back and see if you can do something . &quot;"
And I gave the grand@@ mother my business car@@ d .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re seri@@ ous , I will try to find a family for her . &quot; &quot; And I im@@ medi@@ ately wro@@ te a let@@ ter to my best friends in At@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , who had an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old son ."
And my best friend had mist@@ ak@@ en@@ ly one day said something about wi@@ sh@@ ing he had another child .
"So here my friends G@@ ene and G@@ a@@ il had not heard from me in about a year , and sud@@ den@@ ly I was cal@@ ling , saying &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in Kore@@ a , and I &apos;ve met this ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary girl . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; The grand@@ mother thin@@ ks she &apos;s si@@ ck , but I think maybe we would have to bring the grand@@ mother over also . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll pay for the ... &quot; &quot; I mean , I had this whole sort of picture ."
"So any@@ way , I left ."
And my friends actually said they were very interested in ad@@ op@@ ting her .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , I think I &apos;ll sc@@ are the grand@@ mother to death , if I actually write to her and tell her that you &apos;re wil@@ ling to ad@@ op@@ t her , I want to go back and talk to her . &quot; &quot; But I was off on as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment ."
I figu@@ red I &apos;d come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grand@@ mother .
"And on Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as D@@ ay , I was in B@@ ang@@ ko@@ k with a group of photograph@@ ers and got a tele@@ gra@@ m — back in those days , you got tele@@ gra@@ ms — from Ti@@ me mag@@ az@@ ine saying someone in Kore@@ a had d@@ ied , and left their child in a will to me ."
D@@ id I know anything about this ?
"Because I ha@@ dn &apos;t told them what I was doing , because I was so up@@ set with the story they &apos;d run ."
"So , I went back to Kore@@ a , and I went back to H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook &apos;s vi@@ ll@@ age , and she was gone ."
And the house that I had spent time in was em@@ p@@ ty .
It was incredi@@ bly c@@ old .
"No one in the vi@@ ll@@ age would tell me where H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook was , because the grand@@ mother had always hi@@ d@@ den her from W@@ est@@ er@@ n@@ ers ."
And they had no idea about this re@@ qu@@ est that she &apos;d made of me .
"So I finally found M@@ y@@ ung S@@ ung , her best friend that she used to play with after school every day ."
"And M@@ y@@ ung S@@ ung , under some pres@@ sure from me and the trans@@ lat@@ or , gave us an ad@@ dre@@ ss on the outside of Se@@ ou@@ l ."
"And I went to that ad@@ dre@@ ss and k@@ noc@@ ked on the door , and a man ans@@ wer@@ ed the door ."
"It was not a very nice area of Se@@ ou@@ l , as there were mu@@ d stre@@ ets outside of it ."
"And I k@@ noc@@ ked on the door , and H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook ans@@ wer@@ ed the door , and her eyes were blo@@ od@@ sh@@ ot , and she seem@@ ed to be in sho@@ ck ."
She didn &apos;t re@@ cogni@@ ze me — there was no re@@ cogni@@ tion wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever .
And this man came to the door and kind of bar@@ ked something in Kore@@ an .
"And I said to the trans@@ lat@@ or , &quot; &quot; What did he say ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; He wan@@ ts to know who you are . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , tell him that I am a photograph@@ er . &quot; &quot; I started expla@@ ining who I was , and he inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted ."
"And she said , &quot; &quot; He says he know@@ s who you are , what do you want ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , tell him that I was asked by this little girl &apos;s grand@@ mother to find a family for her . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m her un@@ cle , she &apos;s f@@ ine , you can leave now . &quot; &quot; So I was — you know , the door was being sl@@ am@@ med in my face , it &apos;s incredi@@ bly c@@ old , and I &apos;m trying to think , &quot; &quot; What would the her@@ o do in a movie , if I was writing this as a movie sc@@ ri@@ pt ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , it &apos;s really c@@ old , I &apos;ve come a very long way , do you mind if I just come in for a minu@@ te ? I &apos;m fre@@ e@@ z@@ ing . &quot; &quot;"
So the guy kind of re@@ lu@@ ct@@ an@@ tly let us in and we s@@ at down on the flo@@ or .
"And as we started talking , I saw him ye@@ ll something , and H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook came and brought us some food ."
"And I had this whole ment@@ al picture of , sort of like C@@ in@@ der@@ el@@ la ."
"I sort of had this picture of this incredi@@ bly wonderful , b@@ right , happy little child , who now ap@@ pe@@ ared to be very with@@ d@@ raw@@ n , being en@@ s@@ la@@ ved by this family ."
"And I was really app@@ al@@ led , and I couldn &apos;t figure out what to do ."
"And the more I tr@@ ied talking to him , the less frien@@ d@@ ly he was getting ."
"So I finally decided , I said &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , &quot; &quot; — this is all through the trans@@ lat@@ or , because , this is all , you know , I don &apos;t speak a word of Kore@@ an — and I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , I &apos;m really gl@@ ad that H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook has a family to live with ."
I was very wor@@ ried about her .
"I made a pro@@ mi@@ se to her grand@@ mother , your mother , that I would find a family , and now I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re going to take care of her . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; But you know , I b@@ ou@@ ght an air@@ line ti@@ ck@@ et , and I &apos;m stu@@ ck here for a week . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sta@@ ying in a hot@@ el dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n ."
W@@ ould you like to come and have lu@@ n@@ ch tom@@ or@@ row ?
And you can prac@@ ti@@ ce your En@@ g@@ li@@ sh . &quot; &quot; Because he told me — I was trying to ask him questions about hi@@ m@@ self .
"And so I went to the hot@@ el , and I found two ol@@ der Am@@ er@@ a@@ si@@ ans ."
"A girl wh@@ ose mother had been a pro@@ stitu@@ te , and she was a pro@@ stitu@@ te , and a bo@@ y who &apos;d been in and out of ja@@ il ."
"And I said to them , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , there &apos;s a little girl who has a t@@ iny ch@@ ance of getting out of here and going to America . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s the right deci@@ sion or not , but I would like you to come to lu@@ n@@ ch tom@@ or@@ row and tell the un@@ cle what it &apos;s like to walk down the stre@@ et , what people say to you , what you do for a living ."
And just — I want him to understand what happens if she sta@@ ys here .
"And I could be wrong , I don &apos;t know , but I wi@@ sh you would come tom@@ or@@ row . &quot; &quot; So , these two came to lu@@ n@@ ch , and we got th@@ row@@ n out of the re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant ."
"They were y@@ el@@ ling at him , they were — it got to be really u@@ g@@ ly ."
"And we went outside , and he was just fu@@ ri@@ ous ."
And I knew I had tot@@ ally b@@ low@@ n this whole thing .
"H@@ ere I was again , trying to figure out what to do ."
"And he started y@@ el@@ ling at me , and I said to the trans@@ lat@@ or , &quot; OK , tell him to cal@@ m down , what is he saying ? &quot;"
"And she said , &quot; &quot; Well , he &apos;s saying , &apos; Wh@@ o the he@@ ll are you to walk into my house , some ri@@ ch American with your cam@@ er@@ as around your ne@@ ck , ac@@ c@@ using me of en@@ s@@ la@@ ving my nie@@ ce ?"
"This is my nie@@ ce , I love her , she &apos;s my si@@ ster &apos;s d@@ aughter ."
"Wh@@ o the he@@ ll are you to ac@@ c@@ use me of something like this ? &apos; &quot; &quot; And I said , you know , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re absolu@@ tely right ."
"I don &apos;t pre@@ ten@@ d to understand what &apos;s going on here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; All I know is , I &apos;ve been photograph@@ ing a lot of these children . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in love with your nie@@ ce , I think she &apos;s an incredi@@ bly spe@@ cial child . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , I will f@@ ly my friends over here from the United States if you want to me@@ et them , to see if you appro@@ ve of them ."
"I just think that — what little I know about the situ@@ ation , she has very little ch@@ ance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have . &quot; &quot; So , everyone told me af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds that in@@ vi@@ ting the pro@@ spe@@ ctive parents over was , again , the stu@@ pi@@ d@@ est thing I could have possi@@ bly done , because who &apos;s ever good enough for your rel@@ ative ?"
But he in@@ vi@@ ted me to come to a cer@@ em@@ ony they were having that day for her grand@@ mother .
"And they actually take i@@ tem@@ s of clo@@ thing and photograph@@ s , and they bur@@ n them as part of the ri@@ tu@@ al ."
And you can see how different she looks just in three months .
"This was now , I think , F@@ e@@ bru@@ ary , early F@@ e@@ bru@@ ary ."
And the pi@@ ctures before were taken in Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber .
"Well , there was an American Mar@@ ine pr@@ ie@@ st that I had met in the course of doing the story , who had 7@@ 5 children living in his house ."
He had three women hel@@ ping him take care of these kids .
"And so I su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed to the un@@ cle that we go down and me@@ et F@@ a@@ ther K@@ e@@ ene , to find out how the ad@@ op@@ tion process worked ."
Because I wanted him to feel like this was all being done very much ab@@ o@@ ve bo@@ ard .
"So , this is on the way down to the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age ."
This is F@@ a@@ ther K@@ e@@ ene . He &apos;s just a wonderful guy .
"He had kids from all over Kore@@ a living there , and he would find fam@@ il@@ ies for these kids ."
This is a social wor@@ k@@ er inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ing H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook .
"Now , I had always thought she was completely un@@ tou@@ ched by all of this , because the grand@@ mother , to me , ap@@ pe@@ ared to be sort of the vi@@ ll@@ age wi@@ se woman , and the person everybody — throu@@ gh@@ out the day , I noti@@ ced people ke@@ pt coming to visi@@ t her grand@@ mother ."
"And I always had this ment@@ al picture that even though they may have been one of the po@@ ore@@ r fam@@ il@@ ies in the vi@@ ll@@ age , they were one of the most re@@ spe@@ cted fam@@ il@@ ies in the vi@@ ll@@ age ."
"And I always felt that the grand@@ mother had kind of de@@ man@@ ded , and in@@ si@@ st@@ ed , that the vi@@ ll@@ ag@@ ers tre@@ at H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook with the same re@@ spe@@ ct they tre@@ ated her ."
"H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook sta@@ yed at F@@ a@@ ther K@@ e@@ ene &apos;s , and her un@@ cle ag@@ re@@ ed to let her st@@ ay there until the ad@@ op@@ tion went through ."
He actually ag@@ re@@ ed to the ad@@ op@@ tion .
"And I went off on as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment and came back a week later , and F@@ a@@ ther K@@ e@@ ene said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to talk to you about H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook . &quot; &quot; I kind of said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , now what ? &quot; &quot; And he takes me into this room , and he clo@@ ses the door , and he says , &quot; &quot; I have 7@@ 5 children here in the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age , and it &apos;s tot@@ al be@@ d@@ l@@ am . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s clo@@ the@@ s , and there &apos;s kids , and , you know , there &apos;s three ad@@ ul@@ ts and 7@@ 5 kids — you can imagine ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; The second day she was here she made up a li@@ st of all of the na@@ mes of the ol@@ der kids and the youn@@ ger kids ."
And she as@@ sig@@ ned one of the ol@@ der kids to each of the youn@@ ger kids .
"And then she set up a work de@@ ta@@ il li@@ st of who cle@@ an@@ ed the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age on what day . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; She &apos;s tel@@ ling me that I &apos;m mess@@ y , and I have to cle@@ an up my room . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know who ra@@ is@@ ed her , but , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; she &apos;s ru@@ n@@ ning the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age , and she &apos;s been here three days . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was movie day — that she organiz@@ ed — where all the kids went to the mov@@ ies ."
"A lot of the kids who had been ad@@ op@@ ted actually wro@@ te back to the other kids , tel@@ ling them about what their life was like with their new fam@@ il@@ ies ."
"So , it was a really big deal when the let@@ ters show@@ ed up ."
"This is a woman who is now working at the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age , wh@@ ose son had been ad@@ op@@ ted ."
G@@ ene and G@@ a@@ il started stu@@ dy@@ ing Kore@@ an the moment they had got@@ ten my first let@@ ter .
They really wanted to be able to wel@@ come H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook into their family .
"And one of the things F@@ a@@ ther K@@ e@@ ene told me when I came back from one of these tri@@ ps — H@@ y@@ un@@ -@@ S@@ ook had cho@@ s@@ en the name N@@ at@@ ash@@ a , which I under@@ sto@@ od was from her wat@@ ching a &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ck@@ y and Bu@@ ll@@ win@@ k@@ le &quot; &quot; car@@ to@@ on on the American A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce st@@ ation ."
"This may be one of those my@@ th@@ -@@ bu@@ ster things that we &apos;ll have to clear up here , in a minu@@ te ."
"So , my friend G@@ ene f@@ le@@ w over with his son , T@@ im ."
G@@ a@@ il couldn &apos;t come .
And they spent a lot of time hu@@ dd@@ led over a di@@ cti@@ on@@ ary .
"And this was G@@ ene show@@ ing the un@@ cle where At@@ lan@@ ta was on the ma@@ p , where he li@@ ved ."
This is the un@@ cle sig@@ ning the ad@@ op@@ tion pa@@ per@@ s .
"Now , we went out to din@@ ner that night to ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate ."
"The un@@ cle went back to his family , and N@@ at@@ ash@@ a and T@@ im and G@@ ene and I went out to din@@ ner ."
"And G@@ ene was show@@ ing N@@ at@@ ash@@ a how to use a k@@ ni@@ fe and for@@ k , and then N@@ at@@ ash@@ a was re@@ tur@@ ning the u@@ ten@@ si@@ l l@@ ess@@ ons ."
"We went back to our hot@@ el room , and G@@ ene was show@@ ing N@@ at@@ ash@@ a also where At@@ lan@@ ta was ."
This is the third night we were in Kore@@ a .
The first night we &apos;d got@@ ten a room for the kids right next to us .
"Now , I &apos;d been sta@@ ying in this room for about three months — it was a little 1@@ 5@@ -@@ story Kore@@ an hot@@ el ."
"So , the second night , we didn &apos;t keep the kids &apos; room , because we went down and s@@ lep@@ t on the flo@@ or with all the kids at the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age ."
"And the third night , we came back , we &apos;d just gone out to din@@ ner , where you saw the pi@@ ctures , and we got to the front des@@ k and the guy at the front des@@ k said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no other f@@ ree ro@@ oms on your flo@@ or ton@@ ight , so if you want to put the kids five flo@@ ors be@@ low you , there &apos;s a room there . &quot; &quot; And G@@ ene and I looked at each other and said , &quot; No , we don &apos;t want two 1@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds five flo@@ ors away . &quot;"
"So , his son said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad , I have a sle@@ e@@ ping ba@@ g , I &apos;ll sle@@ ep on the flo@@ or . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , I have one too . &quot; &quot; So , T@@ im and I s@@ lep@@ t on the flo@@ or , N@@ at@@ ash@@ a got one bed , G@@ ene got the other — kids pas@@ s out , it &apos;s been very exci@@ ting for three days ."
"We &apos;re l@@ ying in bed , and G@@ ene and I are talking about how cool we are ."
"We said , &quot; &quot; That was so great , we sa@@ ved this little girl &apos;s life . &quot; &quot; We were just like , you know , ah , just full of ourselves ."
"And we f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep — and I &apos;ve been in this room , you know , for a couple of months now ."
"And they always over@@ he@@ at the hot@@ els in Kore@@ a terri@@ bly , so during the day I always left the win@@ do@@ w open ."
"And then , at night , about mi@@ dni@@ ght , they turn the he@@ at off in the hot@@ el ."
"So at about 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , the whole room would be like 20 be@@ low zer@@ o , and I &apos;d get up ."
I &apos;d been doing this every night I &apos;d been there .
"So , sure enough , it &apos;s one o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck , room &apos;s fre@@ e@@ z@@ ing , I go to close the win@@ do@@ w , and I hear people sh@@ ou@@ ting outside , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , the bar@@ s must have just got@@ ten out . &quot; &quot; And I don &apos;t speak Kore@@ an , but I &apos;m hear@@ ing these vo@@ i@@ ces , and I &apos;m not hear@@ ing ang@@ er , I &apos;m hear@@ ing ter@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I open the win@@ do@@ w , and I look out , and there &apos;s fl@@ am@@ es coming up the side of our hot@@ el , and the hot@@ el &apos;s on fi@@ re ."
"So , I run over to G@@ ene , and I wa@@ ke him up , and I say , &quot; &quot; G@@ ene , don &apos;t fre@@ ak out , I think the hot@@ el &apos;s on fi@@ re . &quot; &quot; And now there &apos;s smo@@ ke and fl@@ am@@ es coming by our win@@ dow@@ s — we &apos;re on the ele@@ ven@@ th flo@@ or ."
"So , the two of us were just like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , oh my God . &quot; &quot; So , we &apos;re trying to get N@@ at@@ ash@@ a up , and we can &apos;t talk to her ."
"And you know what kids are like when they &apos;ve been as@@ le@@ ep for like an hour , it &apos;s like they took five V@@ ali@@ um@@ s — you know , they &apos;re all over the place ."
And we can &apos;t talk to her .
"I remember his son had the L@@ .@@ L@@ . Be@@ an bo@@ ot@@ l@@ ac@@ es , and we &apos;re trying to do up his l@@ ac@@ es ."
"So , we try to get to the door , and we run to the door , and we open the door and it &apos;s like wal@@ king into a b@@ last f@@ ur@@ n@@ ace ."
"There &apos;s people scre@@ am@@ ing , there &apos;s the sound of gl@@ as@@ s bre@@ aking , there &apos;s these we@@ ird th@@ um@@ ps ."
And the whole room fil@@ led with smo@@ ke in about two secon@@ ds .
"And G@@ ene turns around and says , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to make it . &quot; &quot; And he clo@@ ses the door , and the whole room is now fil@@ led with smo@@ ke ."
"We &apos;re all cho@@ king , and there &apos;s smo@@ ke po@@ ur@@ ing through the v@@ ents , under the do@@ ors . There &apos;s people scre@@ am@@ ing ."
"I just remember this un@@ belie@@ v@@ able , just ut@@ ter cha@@ os ."
"I remember sitting ne@@ ar the bed , and I was just so — I had two over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming feel@@ ings ."
"One was absolu@@ te ter@@ ro@@ r — it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Oh , ple@@ ase God , I just want to wa@@ ke up ."
"This has got to be a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are , this can &apos;t be happening ."
"P@@ le@@ ase , I just want to wa@@ ke up , it &apos;s got to be a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are . &quot; &quot; And the other is un@@ belie@@ v@@ able gu@@ il@@ t ."
"H@@ ere I &apos;ve been , playing God with my friends &apos; lives , my friends &apos; son , with N@@ at@@ ash@@ a &apos;s life , and this what you get when you try playing God , is you h@@ ur@@ t people ."
I remember just being so f@@ ri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed and terri@@ f@@ ied .
"And G@@ ene , who &apos;s l@@ ying on the flo@@ or , says , &quot; M@@ an , we &apos;ve got to so@@ ak tow@@ els . &quot; I said , &quot; What ? &quot;"
"He says , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve got to so@@ ak tow@@ els . We &apos;re going to die from the smo@@ ke . &quot; &quot; So , we ran to the ba@@ th@@ room , and got tow@@ els , and put them over our fac@@ es , and the kids fac@@ es ."
"Th@@ en he said , &quot; &quot; Do you have g@@ af@@ f@@ er &apos;s ta@@ pe ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Do you have g@@ af@@ f@@ er &apos;s ta@@ pe ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , some@@ where in my H@@ al@@ li@@ bur@@ ton . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve got to stop the smo@@ ke . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s all we can do , we &apos;ve got to stop the smo@@ ke . &quot; &quot; I mean , G@@ ene — th@@ ank God for G@@ ene ."
"So , we put the room ser@@ vice men@@ us over the v@@ ents in the w@@ all , we put bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ts at the bot@@ tom of the door , we put the kids on the win@@ dow@@ si@@ ll to try to get some air ."
"And there was a building , a new building , going up , that was being built right outside , across the stre@@ et from our hot@@ el ."
"And there , in the building were photograph@@ ers wai@@ ting for people to j@@ um@@ p ."
E@@ le@@ ven people en@@ ded up dy@@ ing in the fi@@ re .
"F@@ i@@ ve people j@@ um@@ ped and d@@ ied , other people were kil@@ led by the smo@@ ke ."
"And there &apos;s this l@@ ou@@ d th@@ um@@ ping on the door after about 4@@ 5 minutes in all this , and people were sh@@ ou@@ ting in Kore@@ an ."
"And I remember , N@@ at@@ ash@@ a didn &apos;t want us open@@ ing the door — sor@@ ry , I was trying not to open the door , because we &apos;d spent so much time bar@@ ri@@ c@@ ading the room ."
"I didn &apos;t know who it was , I didn &apos;t know what they wanted , and N@@ at@@ ash@@ a could tell they were fi@@ re@@ men trying to get us out ."
"I remember a sort of a t@@ us@@ s@@ le at the door , trying to get the door open ."
"In any case , 12 hours later , I mean , they put us in the lob@@ by ."
"G@@ ene en@@ ded up using his co@@ at , and his fi@@ st in the co@@ at , to bre@@ ak open a li@@ qu@@ or c@@ ab@@ in@@ et ."
Pe@@ ople were l@@ ying on the flo@@ or .
It was one of just the most hor@@ ri@@ f@@ ying ni@@ ghts .
"And then 12 hours later , we ren@@ ted a car , as we had plan@@ ned to , and dro@@ ve back to N@@ at@@ ash@@ a &apos;s vi@@ ll@@ age ."
"And we ke@@ pt saying , &quot; &quot; Do you realize we were dy@@ ing in a hot@@ el fi@@ re , like eight hours ago ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so we@@ ird how life just goes on ."
"N@@ at@@ ash@@ a wanted to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce her bro@@ ther and father to all the vi@@ ll@@ ag@@ ers , and the day we show@@ ed up turned out to be a 6@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old man &apos;s bir@@ th@@ day ."
This guy &apos;s 60 years old .
"So it turned into a du@@ al ce@@ le@@ br@@ ation , because N@@ at@@ ash@@ a was the first person from this vi@@ ll@@ age ever to go to the United States ."
"So , these are the gre@@ en@@ house t@@ ents ."
This is the el@@ ders teach@@ ing G@@ ene their dan@@ ces .
"We d@@ ran@@ k a lot of ri@@ ce w@@ ine . We were both so dru@@ n@@ k , I couldn &apos;t believe it ."
This is the last picture before G@@ ene and T@@ im he@@ ad@@ ed back .
The ad@@ op@@ tion people told us it was going to take a year for the ad@@ op@@ tion to go through .
"L@@ i@@ ke , what could you do for a year ?"
"So I found out the name of every offi@@ cial on both the Kore@@ an and American side , and I photograph@@ ed them , and told them how fam@@ ous they were going to be when this book was done ."
"And four months later , the ad@@ op@@ tion pa@@ per@@ s came through ."
This is saying go@@ od@@ by@@ e to everybody at the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age .
This is F@@ a@@ ther K@@ e@@ ene with N@@ at@@ ash@@ a at the bu@@ s stop .
H@@ er great a@@ un@@ t at the air@@ port .
"I had a wonderful deal with C@@ a@@ th@@ ay P@@ aci@@ fic air@@ lin@@ es for many years , where they gave me f@@ ree pas@@ ses on all their air@@ lin@@ es in re@@ turn for photograph@@ y ."
It was like the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate per@@ k .
"And the pi@@ lot , I actually knew — because they used to let me si@@ t in the j@@ um@@ p se@@ at , to tell you how long ago this was ."
"This is a T@@ ri@@ -@@ St@@ ar , and so they let N@@ at@@ ash@@ a actually si@@ t in the j@@ um@@ p se@@ at ."
"And the pi@@ lot , J@@ ef@@ f C@@ ow@@ ley , actually went back and ad@@ op@@ ted one of the other kids at the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age after me@@ e@@ ting N@@ at@@ ash@@ a ."
This is 2@@ 8 hours later in At@@ lan@@ ta . It &apos;s a very long f@@ light .
"J@@ ust to make things even c@@ raz@@ ier , G@@ a@@ il , N@@ at@@ ash@@ a &apos;s new mo@@ m , was three days away from gi@@ ving bir@@ th to her own d@@ aughter ."
"So you know , if you were writing this , you &apos;d say , &quot; No , we &apos;ve got to write the sc@@ ri@@ pt differ@@ ently . &quot;"
This is the first night show@@ ing N@@ at@@ ash@@ a her new cou@@ s@@ ins and un@@ cles and a@@ un@@ ts .
G@@ ene and G@@ a@@ il know everyone in At@@ lan@@ ta — they &apos;re the most social couple imag@@ in@@ able .
"So , at this point , N@@ at@@ ash@@ a doesn &apos;t speak a word of En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , other than what little F@@ a@@ ther K@@ e@@ ene t@@ au@@ ght her ."
"This is K@@ y@@ lie , her si@@ ster , who &apos;s now a do@@ ctor , on the right ."
"This is a deal I had with N@@ at@@ ash@@ a , which is that when we got to At@@ lan@@ ta she could take — she could cut off my be@@ ard ."
She never li@@ ked it very much .
She learned En@@ g@@ li@@ sh in three months .
She en@@ ter@@ ed se@@ ven@@ th gra@@ de at her own age level .
P@@ le@@ dge of Al@@ le@@ gi@@ ance for the first time .
This is her co@@ o@@ king teach@@ er .
"N@@ at@@ ash@@ a told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stu@@ ck up , because they would talk to her and she wouldn &apos;t answer , and they didn &apos;t realize she didn &apos;t actually speak En@@ g@@ li@@ sh very well , in the beginning ."
"But what I noti@@ ced , again as an obser@@ ver , was she was cho@@ os@@ ing who was going to be on her team , and seem@@ ed to be very popul@@ ar very , very quickly ."
"Now , remember the picture , how much she looked like her grand@@ mother , at the beginning ?"
"P@@ e@@ ople were always tel@@ ling N@@ at@@ ash@@ a how much she looks like her mother , G@@ a@@ il ."
"This is a ten@@ se moment in the first fo@@ ot@@ ball g@@ ame , I think ."
"And K@@ y@@ lie — I mean , it was almost like K@@ y@@ lie was her own child ."
She &apos;s being b@@ ap@@ ti@@ zed .
"Now , a lot of parents , when they ad@@ op@@ t , actually want to er@@ ase their children &apos;s history ."
And G@@ a@@ il and G@@ ene did the comple@@ te op@@ posi@@ te .
They were stu@@ dy@@ ing Kore@@ an ; they b@@ ou@@ ght Kore@@ an clo@@ the@@ s .
"G@@ ene even did a little ti@@ le work in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , which was that , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce upo@@ n a time , there was a beautiful girl that came from h@@ il@@ ls of Kore@@ a to live ha@@ p@@ pi@@ ly ever after in At@@ lan@@ ta . &quot; &quot; She h@@ ates this picture — it was her first job ."
She b@@ ou@@ ght a b@@ right red K@@ ar@@ man@@ n G@@ hi@@ a with the money she made working at Bu@@ r@@ ger K@@ ing .
The cap@@ tain of the che@@ er@@ le@@ ad@@ ers .
Be@@ au@@ ty p@@ ag@@ e@@ ant .
U@@ sed to do their Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as car@@ d every year .
G@@ ene &apos;s been re@@ stor@@ ing this car for a million years .
K@@ od@@ ak hi@@ red N@@ at@@ ash@@ a to be a trans@@ lat@@ or for them at the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ cs in Kore@@ a .
"H@@ er future h@@ us@@ b@@ and , J@@ ef@@ f , was working for C@@ an@@ on cam@@ er@@ as , and met N@@ at@@ ash@@ a at the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c V@@ il@@ l@@ age ."
"This is her first tri@@ p back to Kore@@ a , so there &apos;s her un@@ cle ."
This is her hal@@ f-@@ si@@ ster .
She went back to the vi@@ ll@@ age . That &apos;s her best friend &apos;s mother .
And I always thought that was a very An@@ nie H@@ all kind of out@@ f@@ it .
"It &apos;s just , you know , it was just so interesting , just to wat@@ ch — this is her mother in the back@@ ground there ."
This is N@@ at@@ ash@@ a &apos;s we@@ d@@ ding day .
G@@ ene is looking a little ol@@ der .
"This is Sy@@ d@@ ney , who &apos;s going to be three years old in a couple of days ."
And there &apos;s E@@ v@@ an .
"N@@ at@@ ash@@ a , would you just come up , for a second , just maybe to say hel@@ l@@ o to everybody ?"
( Applause ) N@@ at@@ ash@@ a &apos;s actually never heard me tell the story .
"I mean , she — you know , we &apos;ve looked at the pi@@ ctures together ."
"N@@ at@@ ash@@ a : I &apos;ve seen pi@@ ctures mi@@ llions of times , but today was the first time I &apos;m actually seeing him give the whole pres@@ ent@@ ation ."
I started c@@ ry@@ ing .
"R@@ i@@ ck S@@ mo@@ l@@ an : I &apos;m sure there &apos;s about 40 things she &apos;s going to tell me , &quot; That wasn &apos;t what happened , that wasn &apos;t what you said . &quot;"
"N@@ at@@ ash@@ a : L@@ ater , I &apos;ll do that later ."
"( Laughter ) R@@ S : An@@ y@@ way , th@@ ank you , Mi@@ ke and Ri@@ ch@@ ard , so much for le@@ tting us tell the story ."
Thank you all of you .
( Applause )
"Now , ex@@ t@@ in@@ ction is a different kind of death ."
It &apos;s bi@@ g@@ ger .
"We didn &apos;t really realize that until 19@@ 14 , when the last pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on , a fe@@ m@@ ale na@@ med Mar@@ th@@ a , d@@ ied at the C@@ in@@ cin@@ nat@@ i z@@ o@@ o ."
This had been the most ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant bir@@ d in the world that &apos;d been in Nor@@ th America for six million years .
S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly it wasn &apos;t here at all .
F@@ lo@@ cks that were a mi@@ le wi@@ de and 4@@ 00 miles long used to dar@@ k@@ en the su@@ n .
"A@@ l@@ do Le@@ o@@ po@@ ld said this was a biologi@@ cal stor@@ m , a fe@@ a@@ ther@@ ed tem@@ p@@ est ."
"And in@@ de@@ ed it was a ke@@ yst@@ one species that en@@ ri@@ ched the entire e@@ ast@@ er@@ n deci@@ du@@ ous fore@@ st , from the M@@ is@@ si@@ s@@ si@@ pp@@ i to the At@@ lan@@ tic , from C@@ an@@ ada down to the G@@ ul@@ f ."
But it went from five billion bir@@ ds to zer@@ o in just a couple de@@ ca@@ des .
What happened ?
"Well , comm@@ er@@ cial hun@@ ting happened ."
"These bir@@ ds were hun@@ ted for me@@ at that was s@@ old by the ton , and it was e@@ asy to do because when those big flo@@ cks came down to the ground , they were so den@@ se that hundre@@ ds of hun@@ ters and net@@ ters could show up and sl@@ aughter them by the ten@@ s of thousands ."
It was the che@@ ap@@ est source of prote@@ in in America .
"B@@ y the end of the century , there was nothing left but these beautiful sk@@ ins in mus@@ e@@ um speci@@ men d@@ raw@@ ers ."
There &apos;s an up@@ side to the story .
"This made people realize that the same thing was about to happen to the American bi@@ son , and so these bir@@ ds sa@@ ved the bu@@ f@@ fal@@ os ."
But a lot of other animals wer@@ en &apos;t sa@@ ved .
It was hun@@ ted to death for its fe@@ a@@ thers .
There was a bir@@ d that people li@@ ked on the E@@ ast Co@@ ast called the he@@ ath h@@ en .
"A local ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er spe@@ l@@ led out , &quot; &quot; There is no survi@@ v@@ or , there is no future , there is no life to be re@@ created in this form ever again . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a sense of de@@ ep tra@@ ge@@ dy that goes with these things , and it happened to lots of bir@@ ds that people lo@@ ved ."
It happened to lots of m@@ am@@ m@@ als .
A@@ no@@ ther ke@@ yst@@ one species is a fam@@ ous ani@@ mal called the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an au@@ ro@@ ch@@ s .
There was sort of a movie made about it re@@ cent@@ ly .
And the au@@ ro@@ ch@@ s was like the bi@@ son .
"This was an ani@@ mal that basically ke@@ pt the fore@@ st mi@@ x@@ ed with gra@@ s@@ sl@@ ands across the entire Europ@@ e and A@@ si@@ an contin@@ ent , from S@@ pa@@ in to Kore@@ a ."
The do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ation of this ani@@ mal goes back to the L@@ as@@ ca@@ u@@ x ca@@ ve pain@@ t@@ ings .
The ex@@ t@@ in@@ ctions still go on .
There &apos;s an i@@ be@@ x in S@@ pa@@ in called the bu@@ car@@ do .
It went ex@@ t@@ in@@ ct in 2@@ 000 .
"There was a mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous ani@@ mal , a mar@@ su@@ pi@@ al wol@@ f called the th@@ y@@ l@@ ac@@ ine in T@@ as@@ m@@ ania , s@@ outh of Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , called the T@@ as@@ m@@ ani@@ an ti@@ ger ."
A little bit of film was sh@@ ot .
"S@@ or@@ row , ang@@ er , m@@ our@@ ning ."
D@@ on &apos;t m@@ our@@ n . O@@ r@@ gani@@ ze .
"So he and R@@ y@@ an organiz@@ ed and h@@ ost@@ ed a me@@ e@@ ting at the Wy@@ ss In@@ stitu@@ te in H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard br@@ ing@@ ing together speci@@ ali@@ sts on pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ ons , con@@ ser@@ vation or@@ ni@@ th@@ ologi@@ sts , bio@@ e@@ thi@@ ci@@ sts , and for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on DNA had already been sequ@@ en@@ ced by a mo@@ le@@ cular biologi@@ st na@@ med Be@@ th S@@ ha@@ pi@@ r@@ o ."
"A@@ ll she needed from those speci@@ men@@ s at the S@@ mi@@ th@@ s@@ oni@@ an was a little bit of to@@ e p@@ ad ti@@ s@@ su@@ e , because down in there is what is called an@@ cient DNA ."
"It &apos;s DNA which is pretty bad@@ ly fra@@ g@@ men@@ ted , but with good techni@@ qu@@ es now , you can basically reas@@ se@@ m@@ ble the whole gen@@ ome ."
"Th@@ en the question is , can you reas@@ se@@ m@@ ble , with that gen@@ ome , the whole bir@@ d ?"
G@@ e@@ or@@ ge Ch@@ ur@@ ch thin@@ ks you can .
"So in his book , &quot; &quot; Re@@ gen@@ e@@ sis , &quot; &quot; which I re@@ comm@@ end , he has a ch@@ ap@@ ter on the science of br@@ ing@@ ing back ex@@ t@@ in@@ ct species , and he has a mach@@ ine called the M@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple@@ x A@@ ut@@ om@@ ated G@@ en@@ ome En@@ gine@@ ering mach@@ ine ."
It &apos;s kind of like an ev@@ olution mach@@ ine .
"You try com@@ bin@@ ations of gen@@ es that you write at the cell level and then in or@@ g@@ ans on a chi@@ p , and the ones that wi@@ n , that you can then put into a living organi@@ sm . It &apos;ll work ."
"The pre@@ ci@@ sion of this , one of G@@ e@@ or@@ ge &apos;s fam@@ ous un@@ re@@ ad@@ able sli@@ des , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less poin@@ ts out that there &apos;s a level of pre@@ ci@@ sion here right down to the individu@@ al b@@ ase pa@@ ir ."
The pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on has 1@@ .@@ 3 billion b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s in its gen@@ ome .
So what you &apos;re getting is the cap@@ ability now of re@@ plac@@ ing one gen@@ e with another v@@ ari@@ ation of that gen@@ e .
It &apos;s called an al@@ le@@ le .
Well that &apos;s what happens in nor@@ mal hy@@ bri@@ di@@ z@@ ation any@@ way .
"Now along the way , G@@ e@@ or@@ ge poin@@ ts out that his technology , the technology of syn@@ the@@ tic bio@@ logy , is cur@@ r@@ ently ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating at four times the r@@ ate of Mo@@ ore &apos;s L@@ a@@ w ."
"It &apos;s been doing that since 200@@ 5 , and it &apos;s li@@ ke@@ ly to contin@@ ue ."
"G@@ ene@@ ti@@ cally , the b@@ and@@ -@@ ta@@ i@@ led pi@@ ge@@ on already is mo@@ st@@ ly living pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on ."
There &apos;s just some bi@@ ts that are b@@ and@@ -@@ ta@@ i@@ led pi@@ ge@@ on .
"Now , there &apos;s work to do ."
You have to figure out exactly what gen@@ es matter .
A@@ d@@ d them all up and the resul@@ t won &apos;t be perfe@@ ct .
"But it should be be perfe@@ ct enough , because nature doesn &apos;t do perfe@@ ct either ."
So this me@@ e@@ ting in B@@ ost@@ on led to three things .
"F@@ ir@@ st off , R@@ y@@ an and I decided to create a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it called Re@@ vi@@ ve and R@@ est@@ ore that would p@@ us@@ h de@@ -@@ ex@@ t@@ in@@ ction gener@@ ally and try to have it go in a respon@@ si@@ ble way , and we would p@@ us@@ h a@@ head with the pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on ."
"A@@ no@@ ther dire@@ ct resul@@ t was a young gra@@ d stud@@ ent na@@ med B@@ en N@@ o@@ v@@ ak , who had been ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ ons since he was 14 and had also learned how to work with an@@ cient DNA , hi@@ m@@ self sequ@@ en@@ ced the pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on , using money from his family and friends ."
We hi@@ red him fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time .
"Now , this photogra@@ ph I took of him last year at the S@@ mi@@ th@@ s@@ oni@@ an , he &apos;s looking down at Mar@@ th@@ a , the last pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on ali@@ ve ."
"So if he &apos;s suc@@ cess@@ ful , she won &apos;t be the last ."
"And N@@ ational G@@ e@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c got interested because N@@ ational G@@ e@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c has the the@@ ory that the last century , disco@@ very was basically fin@@ ding things , and in this century , disco@@ very is basically making things ."
De@@ -@@ ex@@ t@@ in@@ ction fal@@ ls in that c@@ ate@@ g@@ ory .
"So they h@@ ost@@ ed and fun@@ ded this me@@ e@@ ting . And 3@@ 5 scienti@@ sts , they were con@@ ser@@ vation biologi@@ sts and mo@@ le@@ cular biologi@@ sts , basically me@@ e@@ ting to see if they had work to do together ."
S@@ ome of these con@@ ser@@ vation biologi@@ sts are pretty radi@@ cal .
"There &apos;s three of them who are not just re@@ -@@ cre@@ ating an@@ cient species , they &apos;re re@@ cre@@ ating ex@@ t@@ in@@ ct e@@ co@@ systems in nor@@ ther@@ n S@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ a , in the Ne@@ ther@@ l@@ ands , and in Ha@@ wa@@ ii ."
"H@@ en@@ r@@ i , from the Ne@@ ther@@ l@@ ands , with a D@@ ut@@ ch last name I won &apos;t try to pro@@ n@@ oun@@ ce , is working on the au@@ ro@@ ch@@ s ."
"The au@@ ro@@ ch@@ s is the an@@ c@@ est@@ or of all dom@@ esti@@ c cat@@ tle , and so basically its gen@@ ome is ali@@ ve , it &apos;s just u@@ ne@@ ven@@ ly di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted ."
"So what they &apos;re doing is working with seven bre@@ eds of pri@@ mi@@ tive , har@@ dy@@ -@@ looking cat@@ tle like that Mar@@ em@@ m@@ ana pri@@ mi@@ ti@@ v@@ o on the top there to re@@ build , over time , with se@@ le@@ ctive back@@ -@@ bre@@ e@@ ding , the au@@ ro@@ ch@@ s ."
A@@ no@@ ther amazing story came from Al@@ ber@@ to F@@ er@@ n@@ á@@ n@@ de@@ z@@ -@@ A@@ ri@@ as .
Al@@ ber@@ to worked with the bu@@ car@@ do in S@@ pa@@ in .
"The last bu@@ car@@ do was a fe@@ m@@ ale na@@ med C@@ e@@ li@@ a who was still ali@@ ve , but then they cap@@ tu@@ red her , they got a little bit of ti@@ s@@ su@@ e from her e@@ ar , they c@@ ry@@ op@@ re@@ ser@@ ved it in li@@ qu@@ id ni@@ tro@@ g@@ en , rele@@ as@@ ed her back into the wi@@ ld , but a few months later , she was found de@@ ad under a fal@@ le@@ n t@@ ree ."
"They took the DNA from that e@@ ar , they plan@@ ted it as a c@@ lon@@ ed e@@ g@@ g in a go@@ at , the pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy came to ter@@ m , and a live b@@ aby bu@@ car@@ do was born ."
It was the first de@@ -@@ ex@@ t@@ in@@ ction in history .
( Applause ) It was shor@@ t-@@ li@@ ved .
S@@ ome@@ times inter@@ species c@@ lon@@ es have re@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation problems .
"This one had a mal@@ form@@ ed lu@@ n@@ g and d@@ ied after 10 minutes , but Al@@ ber@@ to was con@@ fi@@ dent that c@@ lon@@ ing has mo@@ ved along well since then , and this will move a@@ head , and ev@@ en@@ tually there will be a popul@@ ation of bu@@ car@@ do@@ s back in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins in nor@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in ."
C@@ ry@@ op@@ re@@ ser@@ vation pi@@ one@@ er of great de@@ p@@ th is O@@ li@@ ver R@@ y@@ der .
"A@@ t the S@@ an D@@ iego z@@ o@@ o , his f@@ roz@@ en z@@ o@@ o has colle@@ cted the ti@@ s@@ su@@ es from over 1@@ ,000 species over the last 3@@ 5 years ."
"Now , when it &apos;s f@@ roz@@ en that de@@ ep , min@@ us 19@@ 6 de@@ gre@@ es C@@ el@@ si@@ us , the cells are in@@ t@@ act and the DNA is in@@ t@@ act ."
"They &apos;re basically vi@@ able cells , so someone like Bo@@ b L@@ an@@ za at A@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ ced C@@ ell T@@ ech@@ no@@ logy took some of that ti@@ s@@ su@@ e from an en@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed ani@@ mal called the J@@ av@@ an ban@@ ten@@ g , put it in a c@@ ow , the c@@ ow went to ter@@ m , and what was born was a live , health@@ y b@@ aby J@@ av@@ an ban@@ ten@@ g , who th@@ ri@@ ved and is still ali@@ ve ."
"So now we go to Mi@@ ke M@@ c@@ Gre@@ w who is a scienti@@ st at R@@ os@@ li@@ n In@@ stitu@@ te in S@@ c@@ ot@@ land , and Mi@@ ke &apos;s doing mi@@ rac@@ les with bir@@ ds ."
"So he &apos;ll take , say , fal@@ c@@ on sk@@ in cells , fi@@ b@@ rob@@ last , turn it into indu@@ ced p@@ lu@@ ri@@ pot@@ ent stem cells ."
"He then has a way to put the ger@@ m pl@@ as@@ m into the em@@ b@@ ry@@ o of a chi@@ ck@@ en e@@ g@@ g so that that chi@@ ck@@ en will have , basically , the g@@ on@@ ads of a fal@@ c@@ on ."
"You get a m@@ ale and a fe@@ m@@ ale each of those , and out of them comes fal@@ con@@ s ."
( Laughter ) Re@@ al fal@@ con@@ s out of sli@@ gh@@ tly do@@ c@@ to@@ red chi@@ ck@@ ens .
B@@ en N@@ o@@ v@@ ak was the youn@@ gest scienti@@ st at the me@@ e@@ ting .
He show@@ ed how all of this can be put together .
"The sequ@@ ence of ev@@ ents : he &apos;ll put together the gen@@ om@@ es of the b@@ and@@ -@@ ta@@ i@@ led pi@@ ge@@ on and the pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on , he &apos;ll take the techni@@ qu@@ es of G@@ e@@ or@@ ge Ch@@ ur@@ ch and get pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on DNA , the techni@@ qu@@ es of Rob@@ er@@ t L@@ an@@ za and Mi@@ cha@@ el M@@ c@@ Gre@@ w , get that DNA into chi@@ ck@@ en g@@ on@@ ads , and out of the chi@@ ck@@ en g@@ on@@ ads get pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on e@@ g@@ gs , squ@@ ab@@ s , and now you &apos;re getting a popul@@ ation of pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ ons ."
"It does ra@@ ise the question of , they &apos;re not going to have pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on parents to te@@ ach them how to be a pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on ."
So what do you do about that ?
"Well bir@@ ds are pretty har@@ d-@@ wi@@ red , as it happens , so most of that is already in their DNA , but to su@@ pp@@ le@@ ment it , part of B@@ en &apos;s idea is to use hom@@ ing pi@@ ge@@ ons to help tra@@ in the young pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ ons how to flo@@ ck and how to find their way to their old ne@@ st@@ ing gro@@ un@@ ds and fe@@ e@@ ding gro@@ un@@ ds ."
"There were some con@@ ser@@ v@@ ati@@ on@@ ist@@ s , really fam@@ ous con@@ ser@@ v@@ ati@@ on@@ ist@@ s like St@@ an@@ ley T@@ em@@ ple , who is one of the f@@ oun@@ ders of con@@ ser@@ vation bio@@ logy , and K@@ ate J@@ ones from the I@@ U@@ C@@ N , which does the R@@ ed Li@@ st ."
"You see , you want to work on prote@@ cting the animals out there ."
"You want to work on getting the market for i@@ v@@ ory in A@@ si@@ a down so you &apos;re not using 2@@ 5@@ ,000 ele@@ ph@@ an@@ ts a year ."
"But at the same time , con@@ ser@@ vation biologi@@ sts are realiz@@ ing that bad news bu@@ ms people out ."
"And so the R@@ ed Li@@ st is really important , keep tr@@ ack of what &apos;s en@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed and cri@@ ti@@ cally en@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed , and so on ."
"But they &apos;re about to create what they call a Gre@@ en Li@@ st , and the Gre@@ en Li@@ st will have species that are doing f@@ ine , th@@ ank you , species that were en@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed , like the bal@@ d e@@ ag@@ le , but they &apos;re much better off now , th@@ an@@ ks to everybody &apos;s good work , and prote@@ cted are@@ as around the world that are very , very well man@@ aged ."
"So basically , they &apos;re lear@@ ning how to build on good news ."
And they see re@@ vi@@ ving ex@@ t@@ in@@ ct species as the kind of good news you might be able to build on .
Here &apos;s a couple re@@ lated exam@@ ples .
C@@ ap@@ tive bre@@ e@@ ding will be a major part of br@@ ing@@ ing back these species .
E@@ very@@ body thought is was fini@@ shed .
"Th@@ an@@ ks to cap@@ tive bre@@ e@@ ding at the S@@ an D@@ iego Z@@ o@@ o , there &apos;s 4@@ 0@@ 5 of them now , 2@@ 2@@ 6 are out in the wi@@ ld ."
That technology will be used on de@@ -@@ ex@@ t@@ in@@ cted animals .
A@@ no@@ ther suc@@ cess story is the m@@ oun@@ tain gor@@ il@@ la in C@@ ent@@ ral Africa .
"In 19@@ 8@@ 1 , D@@ i@@ an F@@ os@@ se@@ y was sure they were going ex@@ t@@ in@@ ct ."
There were just 2@@ 5@@ 4 left .
Now there are 8@@ 80 . They &apos;re incre@@ as@@ ing in popul@@ ation by three percent a year .
"The se@@ cre@@ t is , they have an e@@ co@@ -@@ tou@@ ri@@ sm program , which is absolu@@ tely bri@@ lli@@ ant ."
So this photogra@@ ph was taken last mon@@ th by R@@ y@@ an with an i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
That &apos;s how comfor@@ table these wi@@ ld gor@@ il@@ l@@ as are with visi@@ t@@ ors .
"A@@ no@@ ther interesting project , though it &apos;s going to need some help , is the nor@@ ther@@ n white r@@ h@@ in@@ o@@ cer@@ os ."
There &apos;s no bre@@ e@@ ding pa@@ ir@@ s left .
But this is the kind of thing that a wi@@ de v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of DNA for this ani@@ mal is available in the f@@ roz@@ en z@@ o@@ o .
"A bit of c@@ lon@@ ing , you can get them back ."
So where do we go from here ?
These have been pri@@ v@@ ate me@@ et@@ ings so far .
I think it &apos;s time for the sub@@ je@@ ct to go public .
What do people think about it ?
"You know , do you want ex@@ t@@ in@@ ct species back ?"
Do you want ex@@ t@@ in@@ ct species back ?
( Applause ) T@@ in@@ k@@ er B@@ ell is going to come flu@@ t@@ ter@@ ing down .
What are they con@@ cer@@ ned about ?
We &apos;re also going to p@@ us@@ h a@@ head with the pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on .
"So B@@ en N@@ o@@ v@@ ak , even as we speak , is jo@@ ining the group that Be@@ th S@@ ha@@ pi@@ r@@ o has at U@@ C S@@ an@@ ta C@@ ru@@ z ."
"As that data mat@@ ures , they &apos;ll sen@@ d it to G@@ e@@ or@@ ge Ch@@ ur@@ ch , who will work his mag@@ ic , get pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on DNA out of that ."
"You can do the same thing , as the co@@ sts come down , for the C@@ aro@@ lin@@ a par@@ ak@@ e@@ et , for the great au@@ k , for the he@@ ath h@@ en , for the i@@ v@@ ory@@ -@@ bi@@ l@@ led wo@@ od@@ pe@@ ck@@ er , for the E@@ sk@@ im@@ o cur@@ le@@ w , for the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an mon@@ k se@@ al , for the wo@@ ol@@ ly m@@ am@@ mot@@ h ."
"Because the fact is , hum@@ ans have made a huge ho@@ le in nature in the last 1@@ 0,000 years ."
"We have the ability now , and maybe the mor@@ al ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation , to re@@ pa@@ ir some of the dam@@ age ."
"Mo@@ st of that we &apos;ll do by ex@@ pan@@ ding and prote@@ cting wil@@ d@@ l@@ ands , by ex@@ pan@@ ding and prote@@ cting the popul@@ ations of en@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed species ."
But some species that we kil@@ led off tot@@ ally we could consi@@ der br@@ ing@@ ing back to a world that mis@@ ses them .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Thank you .
I &apos;ve got a question .
"So , this is an emoti@@ onal top@@ ic . S@@ ome people stand ."
There &apos;s going to be un@@ inten@@ ded con@@ sequ@@ ences .
You &apos;re going to un@@ cor@@ k some sort of P@@ and@@ or@@ a &apos;s box of wh@@ o@@ -@@ know@@ s@@ -@@ what . Do they have a point ?
"I think that &apos;s , you know , part of how it &apos;ll work ."
"This is a long , s@@ low process — One of the things I like about it , it &apos;s mul@@ ti@@ -@@ gener@@ ation ."
We will get wo@@ ol@@ ly m@@ am@@ mo@@ ths back .
CA : Well it feel@@ s like both the convers@@ ation and the poten@@ tial here are pretty th@@ ri@@ l@@ ling .
Thank you so much for pres@@ ent@@ ing . S@@ B : Thank you .
"In 200@@ 7 , I became the at@@ tor@@ ney gener@@ al of the state of New J@@ er@@ se@@ y ."
"Be@@ fore that , I &apos;d been a cri@@ min@@ al pro@@ secu@@ tor , first in the M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an di@@ stri@@ ct at@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s offi@@ ce , and then at the United States De@@ part@@ ment of Ju@@ sti@@ ce ."
"But when I became the at@@ tor@@ ney gener@@ al , two things happened that changed the way I see cri@@ min@@ al ju@@ sti@@ ce ."
And I couldn &apos;t get this information out .
It turned out that most big cri@@ min@@ al ju@@ sti@@ ce ag@@ en@@ cies like my own didn &apos;t tr@@ ack the things that matter .
"The second thing that happened is that I spent the day in the C@@ am@@ den , New J@@ er@@ se@@ y poli@@ ce de@@ part@@ ment ."
"Now , at that time , C@@ am@@ den , New J@@ er@@ se@@ y , was the most d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous city in America ."
I ran the C@@ am@@ den Po@@ li@@ ce De@@ part@@ ment because of that .
"And what I saw in that room , as we tal@@ ked about how to redu@@ ce cri@@ me , were a ser@@ ies of offi@@ c@@ ers with a lot of little y@@ el@@ low sti@@ ck@@ y not@@ es ."
"We didn &apos;t even know who was in our cri@@ min@@ al ju@@ sti@@ ce system , we didn &apos;t have any data about the things that mat@@ ter@@ ed , and we didn &apos;t share data or use an@@ al@@ y@@ ti@@ cs or to@@ ols to help us make better deci@@ sions and to redu@@ ce cri@@ me ."
So I wanted to do things differ@@ ently .
"In shor@@ t , I wanted to mon@@ ey@@ ball cri@@ min@@ al ju@@ sti@@ ce ."
"It worked for the O@@ ak@@ land A &apos;s , and it worked in the state of New J@@ er@@ se@@ y ."
"We redu@@ ced mu@@ r@@ ders there by 4@@ 1 percent , which actually means 3@@ 7 lives were sa@@ ved ."
And we redu@@ ced all cri@@ me in the city by 2@@ 6 percent .
We also changed the way we did cri@@ min@@ al pro@@ secu@@ tions .
And we live in a country today where we face seri@@ ous cri@@ min@@ al ju@@ sti@@ ce problems .
We have 12 million ar@@ re@@ sts every single year .
"The v@@ ast maj@@ ori@@ ty of those ar@@ re@@ sts are for low@@ -@@ level cri@@ mes , like mis@@ de@@ me@@ an@@ ors , 70 to 80 percent ."
"@@ Y@@ et we spend 7@@ 5 billion , that &apos;s b for billion , dollars a year on state and local cor@@ re@@ ctions co@@ sts ."
They ha@@ ven &apos;t yet been con@@ vi@@ cted of a cri@@ me .
They &apos;re just wai@@ ting for their day in cour@@ t .
O@@ ur re@@ ci@@ di@@ vi@@ sm r@@ ate is am@@ on@@ g@@ st the high@@ est in the world .
It impac@@ ts everything .

"And when I talk to ju@@ d@@ ges around the United States , which I do all the time now , they all say the same thing , which is that we put d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous people in ja@@ il , and we let n@@ on-@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous , n@@ on@@ viol@@ ent people out ."
They mean it and they believe it .
"We find low@@ -@@ ri@@ sk of@@ f@@ en@@ ders , which makes up 50 percent of our entire cri@@ min@@ al ju@@ sti@@ ce popul@@ ation , we find that they &apos;re in ja@@ il ."
"T@@ ake L@@ es@@ lie Ch@@ e@@ w , who was a T@@ ex@@ as man who sto@@ le four bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ts on a c@@ old win@@ ter night ."
The reason for this is the way we make deci@@ sions .
And so we built a uni@@ vers@@ al ri@@ sk as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment to@@ ol .
And it looks like this .
"And with this to@@ ol , we can pre@@ di@@ ct three things ."
"And every single ju@@ dge in the United States of America can use it , because it &apos;s been created on a uni@@ vers@@ al data set ."
"I actually believe the problem that we see and the reason that we have these incredible system er@@ ro@@ r@@ s , where we &apos;re in@@ car@@ cer@@ ating low@@ -@@ level , n@@ on@@ viol@@ ent people and we &apos;re rele@@ as@@ ing high-@@ ri@@ sk , d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous people , is that we don &apos;t have an obje@@ ctive meas@@ ure of ri@@ sk ."
"The to@@ ol went st@@ ate@@ wi@@ de in Ken@@ tu@@ ck@@ y on Ju@@ ly 1 , and we &apos;re about to go up in a number of other U.@@ S. ju@@ ri@@ s@@ di@@ ctions ."
( Applause )
I wo@@ ke up in the mi@@ ddle of the night with the sound of he@@ av@@ y ex@@ plo@@ sion .
It was de@@ ep at night .
I do not remember what time it was .
I just remember the sound was so he@@ av@@ y and so very sh@@ oc@@ king .
"E@@ very@@ thing in my room was sha@@ king — my heart , my win@@ dow@@ s , my bed , everything ."
I looked out the win@@ dow@@ s and I saw a full hal@@ f-@@ cir@@ cle of ex@@ plo@@ sion .
"I thought it was just like the mov@@ ies , but the mov@@ ies had not con@@ ve@@ yed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of b@@ right red and or@@ ange and gra@@ y , and a full cir@@ cle of ex@@ plo@@ sion ."
And I ke@@ pt on star@@ ing at it until it disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ared .
"I went back to my bed , and I pra@@ yed , and I se@@ cre@@ tly th@@ an@@ ked God that that mis@@ si@@ le did not land on my family &apos;s home , that it did not ki@@ ll my family that night ."
"Th@@ ir@@ ty years have pas@@ sed , and I still feel gu@@ il@@ ty about that pra@@ y@@ er , for the next day , I learned that that mis@@ si@@ le lan@@ ded on my bro@@ ther &apos;s friend &apos;s home and kil@@ led him and his father , but did not ki@@ ll his mother or his si@@ ster ."
"H@@ is mother show@@ ed up the next week at my bro@@ ther &apos;s clas@@ s@@ room and be@@ gg@@ ed se@@ ven@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son , for she had lost everything ."
"This is not a story of a na@@ me@@ less survi@@ v@@ or of war , and na@@ me@@ less re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , wh@@ ose ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pi@@ cal images we see in our ne@@ wsp@@ a@@ per@@ s and our T@@ V with tat@@ ter@@ ed clo@@ the@@ s , di@@ r@@ ty face , sc@@ ared eyes ."
"This is not a story of a na@@ me@@ less someone who li@@ ved in some war , who we do not know their hop@@ es , their dre@@ am@@ s , their ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments , their fam@@ il@@ ies , their belie@@ f@@ s , their val@@ u@@ es ."
This is my story .
I was that girl .
I am another image and vision of another survi@@ v@@ or of war .
"I am that re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e , and I am that girl ."
"You see , I gre@@ w up in war@@ -@@ tor@@ n I@@ ra@@ q , and I believe that there are two si@@ des of war@@ s and we &apos;ve only seen one side of it ."
We only talk about one side of it .
But there &apos;s another side that I have wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed as someone who li@@ ved in it and someone who en@@ ded up working in it .
"I gre@@ w up with the col@@ ors of war — the red col@@ ors of fi@@ re and blo@@ od , the b@@ row@@ n t@@ ones of ear@@ th as it ex@@ plo@@ des in our fac@@ es and the pier@@ cing sil@@ ver of an ex@@ plo@@ ded mis@@ si@@ le , so b@@ right that nothing can prote@@ ct your eyes from it . I gre@@ w up@@ "
"@@ with the sounds of war — the st@@ ac@@ ca@@ to sounds of g@@ un@@ fi@@ re , the w@@ ren@@ ching bo@@ oms of ex@@ plo@@ sions , om@@ in@@ ous d@@ ron@@ es of je@@ ts fl@@ ying over@@ head and the wa@@ il@@ ing war@@ ning sounds of si@@ r@@ ens ."
"These are the sounds you would expe@@ ct , but they are also the sounds of dis@@ son@@ ant con@@ cer@@ ts of a flo@@ ck of bir@@ ds scre@@ ech@@ ing in the night , the high-@@ pit@@ ched hon@@ est c@@ r@@ ies of children and the th@@ under@@ ous , un@@ be@@ ar@@ able sil@@ ence ."
"&quot; &quot; W@@ ar , &quot; &quot; a friend of m@@ ine said , &quot; &quot; is not about sound at all ."
"It is actually about sil@@ ence , the sil@@ ence of hum@@ ani@@ ty . &quot; &quot; I have since left I@@ ra@@ q and f@@ oun@@ ded a group called W@@ om@@ en for W@@ om@@ en Inter@@ national that en@@ ds up working with women survi@@ v@@ ors of war@@ s ."
"In my tra@@ v@@ els and in my work , from Con@@ go to Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , from S@@ ud@@ an to R@@ wan@@ da , I have learned not only that the col@@ ors and the sounds of war are the same , but the fe@@ ars of war are the same ."
"You know , there is a fe@@ ar of dy@@ ing , and do not believe any movie char@@ ac@@ ter where the her@@ o is not af@@ ra@@ id ."
"It is very sc@@ ary to go through that feeling of &quot; &quot; I am about to die &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; I could die in this ex@@ plo@@ sion . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s also the fe@@ ar of lo@@ sing lo@@ ved ones , and I think that &apos;s even wor@@ se ."
It &apos;s too pain@@ ful . You don &apos;t want to think about it .
"But I think the wor@@ st kind of fe@@ ar is the fe@@ ar — as S@@ ami@@ a , a B@@ os@@ ni@@ an woman , once told me , who survi@@ ved the f@@ our@@ -@@ years b@@ es@@ ie@@ ge of S@@ ar@@ a@@ je@@ v@@ o ; she said , &quot; &quot; The fe@@ ar of lo@@ sing the &apos; I &apos; in me , the fe@@ ar of lo@@ sing the &apos; I &apos; in me . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what my mother in I@@ ra@@ q used to tell me ."
It &apos;s like dy@@ ing from in@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ out .
"A P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ an woman once told me , &quot; It is not about the fe@@ ar of one death , &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; sometimes I feel I die 10 times in one day , &quot; &quot; as she was descri@@ b@@ ing the mar@@ ch@@ es of sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s and the sounds of their bu@@ l@@ le@@ ts ."
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s not fa@@ ir , because there is only one life , and there should only be one death . &quot; &quot; We have been only seeing one side of war ."
"We have only been di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing and con@@ sum@@ ed with high-@@ level pre@@ oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ations over tro@@ o@@ p le@@ v@@ els , d@@ raw@@ down ti@@ me@@ lin@@ es , sur@@ ges and st@@ ing oper@@ ations , when we should be exam@@ ining the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of where the social f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c has been most tor@@ n , where the community has impro@@ vi@@ sed and survi@@ ved and sh@@ own ac@@ ts of re@@ sil@@ ience and amazing cou@@ ra@@ ge just to keep life going ."
"We have been so con@@ sum@@ ed with seem@@ ing@@ ly obje@@ ctive di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions of poli@@ ti@@ cs , t@@ acti@@ cs , we@@ apo@@ ns , dollars and c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ties ."
This is the language of st@@ eri@@ lity .
How c@@ as@@ u@@ ally we tre@@ at c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ties in the con@@ te@@ xt of this top@@ ic .
This is where we con@@ cei@@ ve of ra@@ pe and c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ties as in@@ evi@@ t@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies .
E@@ igh@@ ty percent of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es around the world are women and children . Oh .
N@@ in@@ e@@ ty percent of moder@@ n war c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ties are ci@@ vi@@ li@@ ans .
S@@ ev@@ en@@ ty@@ -@@ five percent of them are women and children .
How interesting .
"O@@ h , half a million women in R@@ wan@@ da get ra@@ ped in 100 days ."
"O@@ r , as we speak now , hundre@@ ds of thousands of Con@@ g@@ ol@@ ese women are getting ra@@ ped and mu@@ ti@@ lated ."
How interesting .
These just become num@@ bers that we ref@@ er to .
"The front of war@@ s is incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly n@@ on-@@ human eyes pe@@ ering down on our per@@ cei@@ ved ene@@ mie@@ s from space , gu@@ i@@ ding mis@@ si@@ les tow@@ ard un@@ seen tar@@ gets , while the human con@@ du@@ ct of the or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra of media rel@@ ations in the ev@@ ent that this particular dro@@ ne att@@ ack hi@@ ts a vi@@ ll@@ ag@@ er instead of an extre@@ mi@@ st ."
It is a ch@@ ess g@@ ame .
You learn to play an inter@@ national rel@@ ations school on your way out and up to national and inter@@ national le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship .
Ch@@ e@@ ck@@ m@@ ate .
We are mis@@ sing a completely other side of war@@ s .
"We are mis@@ sing my mother &apos;s story , who made sure with every si@@ re@@ n , with every ra@@ id , with every cut of@@ f-@@ of electri@@ city , she pla@@ yed pu@@ p@@ pe@@ t shows for my bro@@ thers and I , so we would not be sc@@ ared of the sounds of ex@@ plo@@ sions ."
"We are mis@@ sing the story of F@@ are@@ ed@@ a , a music teach@@ er , a pi@@ ano teach@@ er , in S@@ ar@@ a@@ je@@ v@@ o , who made sure that she ke@@ pt the music school open every single day in the four years of b@@ es@@ ie@@ ge in S@@ ar@@ a@@ je@@ v@@ o and wal@@ ked to that school , des@@ pi@@ te the s@@ ni@@ per@@ s sho@@ ot@@ ing at that school and at her , and ke@@ pt the pi@@ ano , the vi@@ o@@ li@@ n , the cel@@ l@@ o playing the whole du@@ r@@ ation of the war , with students we@@ aring their g@@ lo@@ ves and h@@ ats and co@@ ats ."
That was her fi@@ ght .
That was her resi@@ stance .
"We are mis@@ sing the story of Ne@@ hi@@ a , a P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ an woman in G@@ a@@ za who , the minu@@ te there was a ce@@ as@@ e-@@ fi@@ re in the last year &apos;s war , she left out of home , colle@@ cted all the fl@@ our and b@@ ak@@ ed as much b@@ read for every neigh@@ b@@ or to have , in case there is no ce@@ as@@ e-@@ fi@@ re the day after .

"@@ the stories of V@@ i@@ o@@ let , who , des@@ pi@@ te survi@@ ving gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de in the ch@@ ur@@ ch mas@@ s@@ ac@@ re , she ke@@ pt on going on , bu@@ ry@@ ing bod@@ ies , cle@@ an@@ ing hom@@ es , cle@@ an@@ ing the stre@@ ets ."
We are mis@@ sing stories of women who are liter@@ ally ke@@ e@@ ping life going in the mi@@ d@@ st of war@@ s .
Do you know — do you know that people f@@ all in love in war and go to school and go to fac@@ tor@@ ies and ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s and get di@@ v@@ or@@ ced and go dan@@ cing and go playing and live life going ?
And the ones who are ke@@ e@@ ping that life are women .
There are two si@@ des of war .
"There is a side that fi@@ ghts , and there is a side that ke@@ e@@ ps the scho@@ ols and the fac@@ tor@@ ies and the ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s open ."
"There is a side that is fo@@ c@@ used on win@@ ning bat@@ t@@ les , and there is a side that is fo@@ c@@ used on win@@ ning life ."
"There is a side that le@@ ads the fron@@ t-@@ line di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion , and there is a side that le@@ ads the back@@ -@@ line di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
"There is a side that thin@@ ks that pe@@ ace is the end of fi@@ gh@@ ting , and there is a side that thin@@ ks that pe@@ ace is the ar@@ ri@@ v@@ al of scho@@ ols and j@@ ob@@ s . There is a si@@ de@@ "
"@@ that is led by men , and there is a side that is led by women ."
"And in order for us to understand how do we build la@@ st@@ ing pe@@ ace , we must understand war and pe@@ ace from both si@@ des ."
We must have a full picture of what that means .
"In order for us to understand what actually pe@@ ace means , we need to understand , as one S@@ ud@@ an@@ ese woman once told me , &quot; &quot; Pe@@ ace is the fact that my to@@ en@@ ail@@ s are grow@@ ing back again . &quot; &quot; She gre@@ w up in S@@ ud@@ an , in S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ ud@@ an , for 20 years of war , where it kil@@ led one million people and disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed five million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
"M@@ any women were taken as s@@ la@@ ves by re@@ be@@ ls and sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s , as se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ ves who were for@@ ced also to car@@ ry the am@@ muni@@ tion and the water and the food for the sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s ."
"So that woman wal@@ ked for 20 years , so she would not be ki@@ d@@ na@@ pped again ."
"And only when there was some sort of pe@@ ace , her to@@ en@@ ail@@ s gre@@ w back again ."
We need to understand pe@@ ace from a to@@ en@@ a@@ il &apos;s perspe@@ ctive . We need to understand
that we cannot actually have neg@@ oti@@ ations of ending of war@@ s or pe@@ ace without fully inclu@@ ding women at the neg@@ oti@@ ating table .
"I find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fi@@ gh@@ ting and not kil@@ ling and not pi@@ ll@@ ag@@ ing and not bur@@ ning and not ra@@ ping , and the group of people who are mo@@ st@@ ly — though not ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely — who are ke@@ e@@ ping life going in the mi@@ d@@ st of war , are not inclu@@ ded in the neg@@ oti@@ ating table ."
"And I do ar@@ gu@@ e that women le@@ ad the back@@ -@@ line di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion , but there are also men who are ex@@ clu@@ ded from that di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
"The do@@ ct@@ ors who are not fi@@ gh@@ ting , the arti@@ sts , the students , the men who ref@@ use to pi@@ ck up the g@@ un@@ s , they are , too , ex@@ clu@@ ded from the neg@@ oti@@ ating tab@@ les ."
"There is no way we can talk about a la@@ st@@ ing pe@@ ace , building of de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y , susta@@ in@@ able econom@@ ies , any kind of st@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies , if we do not fully inclu@@ de women at the neg@@ oti@@ ating table ."
"N@@ ot one , but 50 percent ."
There is no way we can talk about the building of st@@ ability if we don &apos;t start inv@@ est@@ ing in women and girls .
"D@@ id you know that one year of the world &apos;s mi@@ lit@@ ary sp@@ ending equ@@ als 7@@ 00 years of the U.@@ N@@ . bud@@ get and equ@@ als 2@@ ,@@ 9@@ 2@@ 8 years of the U.@@ N@@ . bud@@ get al@@ lo@@ c@@ ated for women ?"
"If we just re@@ verse that di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion of fun@@ ds , per@@ haps we could have a better la@@ st@@ ing pe@@ ace in this world ."
"And last , but not least , we need to inv@@ est in pe@@ ace and women , not only because it is the right thing to do , not only because it is the right thing to do , for all of us to build susta@@ in@@ able and la@@ st@@ ing pe@@ ace today , but it is for the future ."
"A Con@@ g@@ ol@@ ese woman , who was tel@@ ling me about how her children saw their father kil@@ led in front of them and saw her ra@@ ped in front of them and mu@@ ti@@ lated in front of them , and her children saw their n@@ in@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ old si@@ b@@ ling kil@@ led in front of them , how they &apos;re doing o@@ kay right now ."
She got into W@@ om@@ en for W@@ om@@ en Inter@@ national &apos;s program .
She got a sup@@ port network .
She learned about her ri@@ ghts .
We t@@ au@@ ght her v@@ oc@@ ational and business sk@@ il@@ ls . We hel@@ ped her get a job .
She was ear@@ ning 4@@ 50 dollars . She was doing o@@ kay .
She was sen@@ ding them to school . Ha@@ ve a new home .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; But what I wor@@ ry about the most is not any of that ."
"I wor@@ ry that my children have h@@ ate in their hear@@ ts , and when they want to gro@@ w up , they want to fi@@ ght again the kil@@ l@@ ers of their father and their bro@@ ther . &quot; &quot; We need to inv@@ est in women , because that &apos;s our only ch@@ ance to en@@ sure that there is no more war in the future ."
That mother has a better ch@@ ance to he@@ al her children than any pe@@ ace ag@@ re@@ ement can do .
"A@@ re there good news ? O@@ f course , there are good news . There are lots of good news ."
"To start with , these women that I told you about are dan@@ cing and sing@@ ing every single day , and if they can , who are we not to dance ?"
"That girl that I told you about en@@ ded up star@@ ting W@@ om@@ en for W@@ om@@ en Inter@@ national G@@ rou@@ p that impac@@ ted one million people , s@@ ent 80 million dollars , and I started this from zer@@ o , nothing , na@@ da , &#91; un@@ clear &#93; ."
"( Laughter ) They are women who are standing on their fe@@ et in spi@@ te of their cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces , not because of it ."
"Th@@ in@@ k of how the world can be a much better place if , for a change , we have a better equ@@ ality , we have equ@@ ality , we have a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation and we understand war , both from the fron@@ t-@@ line and the back@@ -@@ line di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
"R@@ u@@ mi , a 1@@ 3@@ th@@ -@@ century Su@@ f@@ i po@@ et , says , &quot; &quot; O@@ u@@ t be@@ y@@ ond the wor@@ l@@ ds of ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ do@@ ings and w@@ ron@@ g@@ -@@ do@@ ings , there is a fie@@ ld ."

Mar@@ co T@@ em@@ p@@ est : What I &apos;d like to show you today is something in the way of an experim@@ ent .
T@@ od@@ ay &apos;s its de@@ but .
It &apos;s a de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of au@@ g@@ men@@ ted re@@ ality .
And the vi@@ su@@ als you &apos;re about to see are not pr@@ er@@ e@@ cor@@ ded .
They are live and re@@ ac@@ ting to me in real time .
I like to think of it as a kind of technologi@@ cal mag@@ ic .
So fin@@ g@@ ers cro@@ s@@ sed .
And keep your eyes on the big scre@@ en .
Au@@ g@@ men@@ ted re@@ ality is the me@@ l@@ ding of the real world with compu@@ ter@@ -@@ gener@@ ated imag@@ ery .
"It seem@@ s the perfe@@ ct medi@@ um to inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ate mag@@ ic and ask , why , in a technologi@@ cal age , we contin@@ ue to have this mag@@ i@@ cal sense of won@@ der ."
"M@@ ag@@ ic is de@@ cep@@ tion , but it is a de@@ cep@@ tion we en@@ jo@@ y ."
"To en@@ jo@@ y being de@@ cei@@ ved , an audience must first s@@ us@@ p@@ end its dis@@ belie@@ f ."
It was the po@@ et S@@ am@@ u@@ el T@@ a@@ y@@ lor Col@@ eri@@ dge who first su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed this re@@ cep@@ tive state of mind .
"S@@ am@@ u@@ el T@@ a@@ y@@ lor Col@@ eri@@ dge : I try to con@@ v@@ ey a se@@ m@@ bl@@ ance of tru@@ th in my writing to produ@@ ce for these sha@@ dow@@ s of the imag@@ in@@ ation a wil@@ ling s@@ us@@ pen@@ sion of dis@@ belie@@ f that , for a moment , con@@ stitu@@ tes po@@ e@@ tic fai@@ th ."
M@@ T : This fai@@ th in the fi@@ cti@@ onal is essen@@ tial for any kind of the@@ at@@ ri@@ cal experience .
"Wi@@ th@@ out it , a sc@@ ri@@ pt is just words ."
Au@@ g@@ men@@ ted re@@ ality is just the lat@@ est technology .
And sle@@ ight of hand is just an ar@@ t@@ ful de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity .
We are all very good at s@@ us@@ pen@@ ding our dis@@ belie@@ f .
"We do it every day , while re@@ ading no@@ v@@ els , wat@@ ching tele@@ vision or going to the mov@@ ies ."
We wil@@ lin@@ g@@ ly enter fi@@ cti@@ onal wor@@ l@@ ds where we che@@ er our her@@ o@@ es and c@@ ry for friends we never had .
Wi@@ th@@ out this ability there is no mag@@ ic .
"It was Je@@ an Rob@@ er@@ t-@@ H@@ ou@@ d@@ in , Fran@@ ce &apos;s gre@@ at@@ est il@@ lu@@ si@@ oni@@ st , who first re@@ cogni@@ zed the ro@@ le of the mag@@ i@@ ci@@ an as a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler ."
He said something that I &apos;ve post@@ ed on the w@@ all of my studi@@ o .
Je@@ an Rob@@ er@@ t-@@ H@@ ou@@ d@@ in : A con@@ ju@@ re@@ r is not a ju@@ gg@@ ler .
He is an ac@@ tor playing the part of a mag@@ i@@ ci@@ an .
M@@ T : Wh@@ ich means mag@@ ic is the@@ ater and every tri@@ ck is a story .
The tri@@ cks of mag@@ ic fol@@ low the ar@@ che@@ typ@@ es of nar@@ r@@ ative fi@@ ction .
"There are tal@@ es of cre@@ ation and lo@@ ss , death and re@@ sur@@ re@@ ction , and ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les that must be over@@ come ."
Now many of them are inten@@ se@@ ly dra@@ m@@ atic .
"M@@ ag@@ i@@ ci@@ ans play with fi@@ re and ste@@ el , de@@ fy the f@@ ury of the bu@@ z@@ z@@ saw , d@@ are to cat@@ ch a bu@@ l@@ let or at@@ tem@@ pt a de@@ ad@@ ly es@@ cape ."
"But aud@@ ien@@ ces don &apos;t come to see the mag@@ i@@ ci@@ an die , they come to see him live ."
Because the best stories always have a happy ending .
The tri@@ cks of mag@@ ic have one spe@@ cial ele@@ ment .
They are stories with a t@@ wi@@ st .
Now E@@ d@@ ward de B@@ ono ar@@ gu@@ ed that our bra@@ ins are pat@@ ter@@ n mat@@ ching mach@@ ines .
He said that mag@@ i@@ ci@@ ans deli@@ ber@@ ately ex@@ plo@@ it the way their aud@@ ien@@ ces think .
E@@ d@@ ward de B@@ ono : St@@ age mag@@ ic rel@@ ies almost wh@@ ol@@ ly on the mom@@ entu@@ m er@@ ro@@ r .
"The audience is led to make as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions or el@@ ab@@ or@@ ations that are perfe@@ ct@@ ly reas@@ on@@ able , but do not , in fact , mat@@ ch what is being done in front of them ."
"M@@ T : In that re@@ spe@@ ct , mag@@ ic tri@@ cks are like jo@@ k@@ es ."
J@@ ok@@ es le@@ ad us down a pat@@ h to an expe@@ cted de@@ st@@ in@@ ation .
"But when the scen@@ ari@@ o we have imag@@ ined sud@@ den@@ ly fli@@ ps into something enti@@ re@@ ly u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted , we l@@ au@@ gh ."
The same thing happens when people wat@@ ch mag@@ ic tri@@ cks .
"The fin@@ ale def@@ ies logi@@ c , gi@@ ves new in@@ si@@ ght into the problem , and aud@@ ien@@ ces ex@@ pre@@ ss their amaz@@ ement with l@@ aughter ."
It &apos;s fun to be fo@@ o@@ led .
One of the key qu@@ ali@@ ties of all stories is that they &apos;re made to be sh@@ ared .
We feel compe@@ l@@ led to tell them .
When I do a tri@@ ck at a par@@ ty — ( Laughter ) that person will im@@ medi@@ ately pu@@ ll their friend over and ask me to do it again .
They want to share the experience .
"That makes my job more difficult , because , if I want to sur@@ pri@@ se them , I need to tell a story that star@@ ts the same , but en@@ ds differ@@ ently — a tri@@ ck with a t@@ wi@@ st on a t@@ wi@@ st ."
It ke@@ e@@ ps me bus@@ y .
Now exper@@ ts believe that stories go be@@ y@@ ond our ca@@ pac@@ ity for ke@@ e@@ ping us en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ined .
We think in nar@@ r@@ ative stru@@ ctures .
We conne@@ ct ev@@ ents and emoti@@ ons and in@@ st@@ in@@ cti@@ vely trans@@ form them into a sequ@@ ence that can be e@@ a@@ si@@ ly under@@ sto@@ od .
It &apos;s a uni@@ qu@@ ely human ach@@ ie@@ v@@ ement .
"We all want to share our stories , whether it is the tri@@ ck we saw at the par@@ ty , the bad day at the offi@@ ce or the beautiful su@@ n@@ set we saw on vac@@ ation ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , th@@ an@@ ks to technology , we can share those stories as never before , by e@@ ma@@ il , F@@ ace@@ book , blo@@ gs , t@@ wee@@ ts , on TE@@ D@@ .@@ com@@ ."
"The to@@ ols of social net@@ working , these are the di@@ gi@@ tal cam@@ p@@ fi@@ res around which the audience ga@@ thers to hear our story ."
"We turn fac@@ ts into si@@ miles and me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ors , and even fan@@ t@@ as@@ ies ."
We poli@@ sh the rou@@ gh ed@@ ges of our lives so that they feel whole .
"O@@ ur stories make us the people we are and , sometimes , the people we want to be ."
They give us our iden@@ ti@@ ty and a sense of community .
"And if the story is a good one , it might even make us smi@@ le ."

A@@ n ac@@ coun@@ t that expla@@ ins the pre@@ sen@@ ce of beau@@ ty in everything on this li@@ st is not going to be e@@ asy .

"And we get it not from a phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ her of art , not from a post@@ moder@@ n art the@@ ori@@ st or a bi@@ gwi@@ g art cri@@ tic ."
"No , this the@@ ory comes from an exper@@ t on bar@@ n@@ ac@@ les and wor@@ ms and pi@@ ge@@ on bre@@ e@@ ding , and you know who I mean : Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n ."
"O@@ f course , a lot of people think they already know the pro@@ per answer to the question , &quot; What is beau@@ ty ? &quot;"
It &apos;s in the ey@@ e of the be@@ hol@@ der .

"There are many differ@@ ences am@@ ong the ar@@ ts , but there are also uni@@ vers@@ al , cro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral a@@ es@@ the@@ tic ple@@ as@@ ures and val@@ u@@ es ."
How can we expla@@ in this uni@@ vers@@ ality ?
The best answer l@@ ies in trying to re@@ con@@ stru@@ ct a D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ an ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary history of our arti@@ stic and a@@ es@@ the@@ tic ta@@ st@@ es .
"We need to re@@ ver@@ se@@ -@@ engine@@ er our present arti@@ stic ta@@ st@@ es and pre@@ fer@@ ences and expla@@ in how they came to be en@@ gra@@ ved in our min@@ ds by the ac@@ tions of both our pre@@ histor@@ ic , lar@@ ge@@ ly ple@@ ist@@ o@@ cen@@ e environ@@ ments , where we became fully human , but also by the social situ@@ ations in which we ev@@ olved ."
This re@@ verse engine@@ ering can also en@@ li@@ st help from the human recor@@ d pre@@ ser@@ ved in pre@@ history .
"I mean f@@ os@@ si@@ ls , ca@@ ve pain@@ t@@ ings and so for@@ th ."
And it should take into ac@@ coun@@ t what we know of the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic interest@@ s of is@@ ol@@ ated hun@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ er b@@ ands that survi@@ ved into the 19@@ th and the 20@@ th cen@@ tur@@ ies .
"Now , I per@@ son@@ ally have no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever that the experience of beau@@ ty , with its emoti@@ onal inten@@ sity and ple@@ as@@ ure , be@@ lon@@ gs to our ev@@ olved human psycho@@ logy ."
The experience of beau@@ ty is one com@@ pon@@ ent in a whole ser@@ ies of D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ an ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ations .
"Be@@ au@@ ty is an ad@@ ap@@ tive effe@@ ct , which we ex@@ ten@@ d and inten@@ si@@ fy in the cre@@ ation and en@@ jo@@ y@@ ment of works of art and en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment ."
"As many of you will know , ev@@ olution oper@@ ates by two ma@@ in pri@@ mar@@ y mechani@@ s@@ ms ."
The first of these is natural se@@ le@@ ction — that &apos;s ran@@ dom mu@@ tation and se@@ le@@ ctive re@@ ten@@ tion — along with our basi@@ c an@@ at@@ om@@ y and physi@@ o@@ logy — the ev@@ olution of the pan@@ cre@@ as or the ey@@ e or the fin@@ ger@@ na@@ il@@ s .
"N@@ at@@ u@@ ral se@@ le@@ ction also expla@@ ins many basi@@ c re@@ v@@ ul@@ sions , such as the hor@@ ri@@ d s@@ me@@ ll of ro@@ tting me@@ at , or fe@@ ars , such as the fe@@ ar of s@@ na@@ k@@ es or standing close to the ed@@ ge of a cli@@ ff ."
"N@@ at@@ u@@ ral se@@ le@@ ction also expla@@ ins ple@@ as@@ ures — se@@ x@@ u@@ al ple@@ as@@ ure , our li@@ king for s@@ we@@ et , f@@ at and prote@@ ins , which in turn expla@@ ins a lot of popul@@ ar fo@@ ods , from ri@@ pe f@@ ru@@ its through cho@@ col@@ ate mal@@ ts and bar@@ be@@ cu@@ ed ri@@ b@@ s ."
"The other great prin@@ ci@@ ple of ev@@ olution is se@@ x@@ u@@ al se@@ le@@ ction , and it oper@@ ates very differ@@ ently ."
The pe@@ ac@@ o@@ ck &apos;s mag@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent ta@@ il is the most fam@@ ous example of this .
It did not ev@@ ol@@ ve for natural survi@@ v@@ al .
"In fact , it goes against natural survi@@ v@@ al ."
"No , the pe@@ ac@@ o@@ ck &apos;s ta@@ il resul@@ ts from the mat@@ ing cho@@ i@@ ces made by pe@@ a@@ h@@ ens ."
It &apos;s quite a fami@@ li@@ ar story .
It &apos;s women who actually p@@ us@@ h history forward .
"D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n hi@@ m@@ self , by the way , had no d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts that the pe@@ ac@@ o@@ ck &apos;s ta@@ il was beautiful in the eyes of the pe@@ a@@ h@@ en ."
He actually used that word .
"Now , ke@@ e@@ ping these ideas fir@@ m@@ ly in mind , we can say that the experience of beau@@ ty is one of the ways that ev@@ olution has of aro@@ using and susta@@ ining inter@@ est or fas@@ cin@@ ation , even ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion , in order to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge us tow@@ ard making the most ad@@ ap@@ tive deci@@ sions for survi@@ v@@ al and re@@ produ@@ ction ."
"Be@@ au@@ ty is nature &apos;s way of ac@@ ting at a di@@ stance , so to speak ."
"I mean , you can &apos;t expe@@ ct to e@@ at an ad@@ ap@@ ti@@ vely b@@ ene@@ fi@@ cial land@@ s@@ cape ."
It would har@@ d@@ ly do to e@@ at your b@@ aby or your lo@@ ver .
"So ev@@ olution &apos;s tri@@ ck is to make them beautiful , to have them ex@@ er@@ t a kind of mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ sm to give you the ple@@ as@@ ure of simply looking at them ."
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly an important source of a@@ es@@ the@@ tic ple@@ as@@ ure , the mag@@ ne@@ tic pu@@ ll of beautiful land@@ s@@ cap@@ es ."
"P@@ e@@ ople in very different cul@@ tu@@ res all over the world ten@@ d to like a particular kind of land@@ s@@ cape , a land@@ s@@ cape that just happens to be si@@ mi@@ lar to the ple@@ ist@@ o@@ cen@@ e sa@@ v@@ an@@ nas where we ev@@ olved ."
"This land@@ s@@ cape shows up today on cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s , on post@@ car@@ ds , in the design of g@@ ol@@ f cour@@ ses and public par@@ ks and in g@@ ol@@ d-@@ fra@@ med pi@@ ctures that h@@ an@@ g in living ro@@ oms from New York to New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and ."
It &apos;s a kind of H@@ ud@@ son Ri@@ ver school land@@ s@@ cape fe@@ atur@@ ing open sp@@ ac@@ es of low gra@@ s@@ ses inter@@ sp@@ er@@ sed with cop@@ ses of tre@@ es .
"The tre@@ es , by the way , are often pre@@ fer@@ red if they for@@ k ne@@ ar the ground , that is to say , if they &apos;re tre@@ es you could sc@@ ra@@ m@@ ble up if you were in a ti@@ ght fi@@ x ."

"This land@@ s@@ cape ty@@ pe is re@@ gar@@ ded as beautiful , even by people in countries that don &apos;t have it ."
The ide@@ al sa@@ v@@ an@@ na land@@ s@@ cape is one of the c@@ lear@@ est exam@@ ples where human be@@ ings every@@ where find beau@@ ty in si@@ mi@@ lar vi@@ su@@ al experience .
"But , someone might ar@@ gu@@ e , that &apos;s natural beau@@ ty ."
How about arti@@ stic beau@@ ty ?
I@@ sn &apos;t that ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sti@@ vely cul@@ tu@@ ral ?
"No , I don &apos;t think it is ."
"And once again , I &apos;d like to look back to pre@@ history to say something about it ."
It is wi@@ de@@ ly as@@ sum@@ ed that the ear@@ lie@@ st human ar@@ t@@ works are the stu@@ pen@@ d@@ ously sk@@ il@@ l@@ ful ca@@ ve pain@@ t@@ ings that we all know from L@@ as@@ ca@@ u@@ x and C@@ ha@@ u@@ v@@ et .
"C@@ ha@@ u@@ v@@ et ca@@ ves are about 3@@ 2@@ ,000 years old , along with a few small , reali@@ stic s@@ cul@@ p@@ tu@@ res of women and animals from the same per@@ i@@ od ."
But arti@@ stic and de@@ cor@@ ative sk@@ il@@ ls are actually much ol@@ der than that .
"Be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful sh@@ ell ne@@ ck@@ l@@ ac@@ es that look like something you &apos;d see at an ar@@ ts and c@@ ra@@ f@@ ts fa@@ ir , as well as o@@ ch@@ re body pa@@ int , have been found from around 10@@ 0,000 years ago ."
But the most in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing pre@@ histor@@ ic arti@@ fac@@ ts are ol@@ der even than this .
I have in mind the so@@ -@@ called A@@ che@@ uli@@ an hand ax@@ es .
The ol@@ d@@ est st@@ one to@@ ols are ch@@ op@@ per@@ s from the O@@ l@@ du@@ v@@ a@@ i G@@ or@@ ge in E@@ ast Africa .
They go back about two@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f-@@ million years .
"These c@@ ru@@ de to@@ ols were around for thousands of cen@@ tur@@ ies , until around 1@@ .@@ 4 million years ago when H@@ om@@ o er@@ e@@ ctu@@ s started sha@@ ping single , th@@ in st@@ one b@@ la@@ des , sometimes ro@@ un@@ ded o@@ v@@ als , but often in what are to our eyes an ar@@ re@@ st@@ ing , sym@@ me@@ tri@@ cal poin@@ ted lea@@ f or te@@ ar@@ dro@@ p form ."
"These A@@ che@@ uli@@ an hand ax@@ es — they &apos;re na@@ med after St@@ . A@@ che@@ u@@ l in Fran@@ ce , where fin@@ ds were made in 19@@ th century — have been u@@ ne@@ ar@@ the@@ d in their thousands , sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ed across A@@ si@@ a , Europ@@ e and Africa , almost every@@ where H@@ om@@ o er@@ e@@ ctu@@ s and H@@ om@@ o er@@ g@@ ast@@ er ro@@ am@@ ed ."
"Now , the sh@@ e@@ er num@@ bers of these hand ax@@ es shows that they can &apos;t have been made for bu@@ t@@ ch@@ ering animals ."
"And the p@@ lot really thi@@ ck@@ ens when you realize that , un@@ like other ple@@ ist@@ o@@ cen@@ e to@@ ols , the hand ax@@ es often ex@@ hi@@ bit no evi@@ dence of we@@ ar on their de@@ lic@@ ate bl@@ ade ed@@ ges ."
"And some , in any ev@@ ent , are too big to use for bu@@ t@@ ch@@ ery ."
"Th@@ e@@ ir sym@@ me@@ try , their at@@ trac@@ tive materi@@ als and , ab@@ o@@ ve all , their me@@ ti@@ cul@@ ous wor@@ k@@ man@@ ship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes , even today ."
"So what were these an@@ cient — I mean , they &apos;re an@@ cient , they &apos;re fore@@ ig@@ n , but they &apos;re at the same time some@@ how fami@@ li@@ ar ."
What were these arti@@ fac@@ ts for ?
"The best available answer is that they were liter@@ ally the ear@@ lie@@ st known works of art , prac@@ tical to@@ ols trans@@ form@@ ed into cap@@ ti@@ v@@ ating a@@ es@@ the@@ tic obje@@ cts , con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated both for their ele@@ g@@ ant sha@@ pe and their vi@@ r@@ tu@@ o@@ so c@@ ra@@ f@@ t@@ s@@ man@@ ship ."
"H@@ and ax@@ es mar@@ k an ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary adv@@ ance in human history — to@@ ols fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ed to fun@@ ction as what D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ ans call &quot; &quot; fi@@ t@@ ness sig@@ n@@ als &quot; &quot; — that is to say , disp@@ la@@ ys that are perform@@ an@@ ces like the pe@@ ac@@ o@@ ck &apos;s ta@@ il , ex@@ cept that , un@@ like ha@@ ir and fe@@ a@@ thers , the hand ax@@ es are con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously cle@@ ver@@ ly c@@ ra@@ f@@ ted ."

"You know , it &apos;s an old line , but it has been sh@@ own to work — &quot; Why don &apos;t you come up to my ca@@ ve , so I can show you my hand ax@@ es ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) E@@ x@@ cept , of course , what &apos;s interesting about this is that we can &apos;t be sure how that idea was con@@ ve@@ yed , because the H@@ om@@ o er@@ e@@ ctu@@ s that made these obje@@ cts did not have language ."
"It &apos;s hard to gra@@ s@@ p , but it &apos;s an incredible fact ."
"This obje@@ ct was made by a hom@@ in@@ id an@@ c@@ est@@ or , H@@ om@@ o er@@ e@@ ctu@@ s or H@@ om@@ o er@@ g@@ ast@@ er , between 5@@ 0,000 and 10@@ 0,000 years before language ."
"S@@ tre@@ t@@ ching over a million years , the hand ax@@ e tra@@ di@@ tion is the lon@@ gest arti@@ stic tra@@ di@@ tion in human and pro@@ to@@ -@@ human history ."
"B@@ y the end of the hand ax@@ e epi@@ c , H@@ om@@ o sa@@ pie@@ ns — as they were then called , finally — were d@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ less fin@@ ding new ways to am@@ use and am@@ a@@ ze each other by , who know@@ s , tel@@ ling jo@@ k@@ es , stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ling , dan@@ cing , or ha@@ ir@@ sty@@ ling ."

"For us moder@@ ns , vi@@ r@@ tu@@ o@@ so techni@@ qu@@ e is used to create imag@@ in@@ ary wor@@ l@@ ds in fi@@ ction and in mov@@ ies , to ex@@ pre@@ ss inten@@ se emoti@@ ons with music , pain@@ ting and dance ."
"But still , one fundam@@ ent@@ al tra@@ it of the an@@ c@@ est@@ ral per@@ son@@ ality per@@ si@@ sts in our a@@ es@@ the@@ tic c@@ ra@@ v@@ ings : the beau@@ ty we find in sk@@ il@@ led perform@@ an@@ ces ."

Is beau@@ ty in the ey@@ e of the be@@ hol@@ der ?
"No , it &apos;s de@@ ep in our min@@ ds ."

"Well , I was born with a r@@ are vi@@ su@@ al con@@ di@@ tion called ach@@ ro@@ mat@@ op@@ si@@ a , which is tot@@ al color b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness , so I &apos;ve never seen color , and I don &apos;t know what color looks like , because I come from a gra@@ y@@ scale world ."
"To me , the sk@@ y is always gra@@ y , f@@ low@@ ers are always gra@@ y , and tele@@ vision is still in black and white ."
"But , since the age of 2@@ 1 , instead of seeing color , I can hear color ."
"In 200@@ 3 , I started a project with computer scienti@@ st A@@ d@@ am M@@ on@@ tan@@ don , and the resul@@ t , with f@@ ur@@ ther col@@ labor@@ ations with Pe@@ ter K@@ ese from S@@ lo@@ v@@ enia and M@@ ati@@ as Li@@ z@@ ana from Bar@@ cel@@ ona , is this ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic ey@@ e ."
"It &apos;s a color sen@@ s@@ or that de@@ te@@ cts the color fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy in front of me — ( F@@ re@@ qu@@ en@@ cy sounds ) — and sen@@ ds this fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy to a chi@@ p in@@ stal@@ led at the back of my head , and I hear the color in front of me through the b@@ one , through b@@ one con@@ du@@ ction ."
"( F@@ re@@ qu@@ en@@ cy sounds ) So , for example , if I have , like — This is the sound of pur@@ ple . ( F@@ re@@ qu@@ en@@ cy sounds ) F@@ or example , this is the sound of gra@@ ss . ( F@@ re@@ qu@@ en@@ cy sounds ) This is red , like TED . ( F@@ re@@ qu@@ en@@ cy sounds ) This is the sound of a di@@ r@@ ty so@@ ck . ( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich is like y@@ el@@ low , this one ."
"So I &apos;ve been hear@@ ing color all the time for eight years , since 200@@ 4 , so I find it completely nor@@ mal now to hear color all the time ."
"A@@ t the start , though , I had to memor@@ i@@ ze the na@@ mes you give for each color , so I had to memor@@ i@@ ze the not@@ es , but after some time , all this information became a per@@ cep@@ tion ."
I didn &apos;t have to think about the not@@ es .
"And after some time , this per@@ cep@@ tion became a feeling ."
"I started to have fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te col@@ ors , and I started to dre@@ am in col@@ ors ."
"So , when I started to dre@@ am in color is when I felt that the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are and my brain had uni@@ ted , because in my dre@@ am@@ s , it was my brain cre@@ ating ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic sounds . It wasn &apos;t the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are , so that &apos;s when I started to feel like a cy@@ bor@@ g ."
It &apos;s when I started to feel that the cy@@ ber@@ ne@@ tic de@@ vice was no longer a de@@ vice .
"It had become a part of my body , an ex@@ ten@@ sion of my sen@@ ses , and after some time , it even became a part of my offi@@ cial image ."
This is my pas@@ spor@@ t from 200@@ 4 .
"You &apos;re not allow@@ ed to ap@@ pe@@ ar on U.@@ K@@ . pas@@ spor@@ ts with ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic e@@ qui@@ pment , but I in@@ si@@ st@@ ed to the pas@@ spor@@ t offi@@ ce that what they were seeing was actually a new part of my body , an ex@@ ten@@ sion of my brain , and they finally ac@@ cep@@ ted me to ap@@ pe@@ ar with the pas@@ spor@@ t ph@@ oto ."
"So , life has changed dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally since I hear color , because color is almost every@@ where , so the bi@@ ggest change for example is going to an art gal@@ l@@ ery , I can list@@ en to a P@@ i@@ c@@ as@@ so , for example . So it &apos;s like I &apos;m going to a con@@ cer@@ t h@@ all , because I can list@@ en to the pain@@ t@@ ings ."
"And super@@ marke@@ ts , I find this is very sh@@ oc@@ king , it &apos;s very , very at@@ trac@@ tive to walk along a super@@ market ."
It &apos;s like going to a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ c@@ lub .
It &apos;s full of different me@@ lo@@ d@@ ies . ( Laughter ) Yeah .
E@@ speci@@ ally the a@@ is@@ le with cle@@ an@@ ing produ@@ cts .
"It &apos;s just f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous . ( Laughter ) Al@@ so , the way I dre@@ ss has changed ."
"Be@@ fore , I used to dre@@ ss in a way that it looked good ."
"Now I dre@@ ss in a way that it sounds good . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So today I &apos;m dre@@ s@@ sed in C major , so it &apos;s quite a happy ch@@ or@@ d . ( Laughter ) If I had to go to a fun@@ er@@ al , though , I would dre@@ ss in B min@@ or , which would be tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise , pur@@ ple and or@@ ange . ( Laughter ) Al@@ so , food , the way I look at food has changed , because now I can disp@@ l@@ ay the food on a pl@@ ate , so I can e@@ at my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te s@@ ong . ( Laughter ) So depen@@ ding on how I disp@@ l@@ ay it , I can hear and I can com@@ pos@@ e music with food ."
"So imagine a re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant where we can have , like , L@@ ady G@@ ag@@ a s@@ al@@ ads as star@@ ters . ( Laughter ) I mean , this would get te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers to e@@ at their ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les , probably ."
"And also , some R@@ ach@@ man@@ in@@ o@@ v pi@@ ano con@@ cer@@ to@@ s as ma@@ in di@@ sh@@ es , and some B@@ j@@ ork or M@@ ad@@ on@@ na des@@ ser@@ ts , that would be a very exci@@ ting re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant where you can actually e@@ at son@@ gs ."
"A@@ l@@ so , the way I per@@ cei@@ ve beau@@ ty has changed , because when I look at someone , I hear their face , so someone might look very beautiful but sound terri@@ ble ."
"( Laughter ) And it might happen the op@@ posi@@ te , the other way around . So I really en@@ jo@@ y cre@@ ating , like , sound por@@ tra@@ its of people ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad of d@@ raw@@ ing someone &apos;s face , like d@@ raw@@ ing the sha@@ pe , I point at them with the ey@@ e and I write down the different not@@ es I hear , and then I create sound por@@ tra@@ its ."
Here &apos;s some fac@@ es .
"( Musi@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds ) Yeah , Ni@@ co@@ le K@@ i@@ d@@ man sounds good . ( Laughter ) S@@ ome people , I would never rel@@ ate , but they sound si@@ mi@@ lar ."
P@@ r@@ in@@ ce Ch@@ ar@@ les has some si@@ mi@@ lar@@ it@@ ies with Ni@@ co@@ le K@@ i@@ d@@ man .
They have si@@ mi@@ lar sound of eyes .
"So you rel@@ ate people that you wouldn &apos;t rel@@ ate , and you can actually also create con@@ cer@@ ts by looking at the audience fac@@ es ."
"So I conne@@ ct the ey@@ e , and then I play the audience &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"The good thing about this is , if the con@@ cer@@ t doesn &apos;t sound good , it &apos;s their f@@ au@@ l@@ t ."
"It &apos;s not my f@@ au@@ l@@ t , because — ( Laughter ) And so another thing that happens is that I started having this secon@@ d@@ ary effe@@ ct that nor@@ mal sounds started to become color ."
"I heard a tele@@ phone t@@ one , and it felt green because it soun@@ ded just like the color green ."
"The B@@ B@@ C be@@ e@@ ps , they sound tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise , and list@@ ening to Mo@@ zar@@ t became a y@@ el@@ low experience , so I started to pa@@ int music and pa@@ int people &apos;s vo@@ i@@ ces , because people &apos;s vo@@ i@@ ces have fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cies that I rel@@ ate to color ."
And here &apos;s some music trans@@ lated into color .
"For example , Mo@@ zar@@ t , &quot; &quot; Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of the N@@ ight , &quot; &quot; looks like this ."
"( Music ) V@@ ery y@@ el@@ low and very col@@ or@@ ful , because there &apos;s many different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cies . ( Music )"
And this is a completely different s@@ ong .
( Music ) It &apos;s Ju@@ st@@ in B@@ ie@@ ber &apos;s &quot; &quot; B@@ aby . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Music ) It is very p@@ in@@ k and very y@@ el@@ low .
"So , also vo@@ i@@ ces , I can trans@@ form spe@@ ech@@ es into color , for example , these are two very wel@@ l-@@ known spe@@ ech@@ es ."
"One of them is Mar@@ t@@ in Lu@@ ther K@@ ing &apos;s &quot; &quot; I Ha@@ ve A D@@ re@@ am , &quot; &quot; and the other one is H@@ it@@ ler ."
"And I like to ex@@ hi@@ bit these pain@@ t@@ ings in the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion hal@@ ls without la@@ be@@ ls , and then I ask people , &quot; Wh@@ ich one do you pre@@ f@@ er ? &quot;"
And most people change their pre@@ fer@@ ence when I tell them that the one on the left is H@@ it@@ ler and the one on the right is Mar@@ t@@ in Lu@@ ther K@@ ing .
"So I got to a point when I was able to per@@ cei@@ ve 3@@ 60 col@@ ors , just like human vision ."
I was able to differ@@ enti@@ ate all the de@@ gre@@ es of the color whe@@ el .
"But then , I just thought that this human vision wasn &apos;t good enough ."
"There &apos;s many , many more col@@ ors around us that we cannot per@@ cei@@ ve , but that ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic eyes can per@@ cei@@ ve ."
"So I decided to contin@@ ue ex@@ ten@@ ding my color sen@@ ses , and I ad@@ ded in@@ fr@@ ared and I ad@@ ded ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let to the col@@ or@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sound scale , so now I can hear col@@ ors that the human ey@@ e cannot per@@ cei@@ ve ."
"For example , per@@ cei@@ ving in@@ fr@@ ared is good because you can actually de@@ te@@ ct if there &apos;s movement de@@ te@@ ct@@ ors in a room ."
I can hear if someone poin@@ ts at me with a re@@ mot@@ e control .
"And the good thing about per@@ cei@@ ving ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let is that you can hear if it &apos;s a good day or a bad day to su@@ n@@ ba@@ the , because ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let is a d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous color , a color that can actually ki@@ ll us , so I think we should all have this wi@@ sh to per@@ cei@@ ve things that we cannot per@@ cei@@ ve ."
"That &apos;s why , two years ago , I created the C@@ y@@ bor@@ g F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation , which is a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation that tries to help people become a cy@@ bor@@ g , tries to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge people to ex@@ ten@@ d their sen@@ ses by using technology as part of the body ."
"We should all think that know@@ le@@ dge comes from our sen@@ ses , so if we ex@@ ten@@ d our sen@@ ses , we will con@@ sequ@@ ently ex@@ ten@@ d our know@@ le@@ dge ."
I think life will be much more exci@@ ting when we stop cre@@ ating app@@ lic@@ ations for mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones and we start cre@@ ating app@@ lic@@ ations for our own body .
"I think this will be a big , big change that we will see during this century ."
So I do en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you all to think about which sen@@ ses you &apos;d like to ex@@ ten@@ d .
I would en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you to become a cy@@ bor@@ g .
You won &apos;t be alone . Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )

I want to de@@ but a new s@@ ong that I &apos;ve been working on in the last five or six months .

( Laughter ) I &apos;m kind of hop@@ ing some convers@@ ations here might help me fin@@ is@@ h it .
Because it gets into all sor@@ ts of c@@ razy re@@ al@@ ms .
"And so this is basically a s@@ ong about lo@@ op@@ s , but not the kind of lo@@ op@@ s that I make up here ."
They &apos;re fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op@@ s .
"And in the au@@ di@@ o world that &apos;s when the micro@@ phone gets too close to its sound source , and then it gets in this self-@@ de@@ stru@@ ctive loo@@ p that cre@@ ates a very un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant sound ."

"So like , you can &apos;t fe@@ ed c@@ ow@@ s their own bra@@ ins or you get ma@@ d c@@ ow dise@@ ase , and in@@ bre@@ e@@ ding and in@@ c@@ est and , let &apos;s see , what &apos;s the other one ?"
"B@@ i@@ ologi@@ cal — there &apos;s au@@ to@@ im@@ mu@@ ne dise@@ ases , where the body att@@ ac@@ ks itself a little too over@@ ze@@ al@@ ously and de@@ stro@@ ys the ho@@ st , or the person ."
"And then — o@@ kay , this is where we get to the s@@ ong — kind of bri@@ d@@ ges the ga@@ p to the emoti@@ onal ."
"Because al@@ though I &apos;ve used scienti@@ fic terms in son@@ gs , it &apos;s very difficult sometimes to make them ly@@ ri@@ cal ."
And there &apos;s some things you just don &apos;t need to have in son@@ gs .
So I &apos;m trying to bri@@ dge this ga@@ p between this idea and this me@@ lo@@ dy .
"And so , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever had this , but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sle@@ ep , I can &apos;t stop thinking about my own eyes ."
And it &apos;s like your eyes start stra@@ ining to see themselves .

I &apos;m sor@@ ry if I put that idea in your head .
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s im@@ possible , of course , for your eyes to see themselves , but they se@@ em to be trying ."
So that &apos;s getting a little more clo@@ s@@ er to a per@@ s@@ onal experience .
O@@ r ear@@ s being able to hear themselves — it &apos;s just im@@ possible .
That &apos;s the thing .

"I want you now to imagine a we@@ ar@@ able robot that gi@@ ves you super@@ human abi@@ lit@@ ies , or another one that takes whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir us@@ ers up standing and wal@@ king again ."
We at B@@ er@@ k@@ ele@@ y Bi@@ oni@@ cs call these rob@@ ots ex@@ o@@ sk@@ ele@@ t@@ ons .
"These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you ex@@ tra str@@ eng@@ th , and it will f@@ ur@@ ther en@@ h@@ ance your speed , and it will help you , for in@@ stance , to man@@ age your bal@@ ance ."
It is actually the true inte@@ gr@@ ation of the man and the mach@@ ine .
But not only that — it will inte@@ gr@@ ate and network you to the universe and other de@@ vi@@ ces out there .
This is just not some blue sk@@ y thinking .
"To show you now what we are working on by star@@ ting out talking about the American sol@@ d@@ ier , that on a@@ ver@@ age does car@@ ry about 100 l@@ b@@ s. on their bac@@ ks , and they are being asked to car@@ ry more e@@ qui@@ pment ."
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , this is resul@@ ting in some major comp@@ lic@@ ations — back in@@ j@@ ur@@ ies , 30 percent of them — chro@@ nic back in@@ j@@ ur@@ ies ."
So we thought we would look at this challen@@ ge and create an ex@@ o@@ sk@@ ele@@ ton that would help deal with this issue .
So let me now in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce to you H@@ U@@ L@@ C — or the H@@ um@@ an Uni@@ vers@@ al L@@ o@@ ad C@@ ar@@ r@@ ier .
"S@@ ol@@ d@@ ier : Wi@@ th the H@@ U@@ L@@ C ex@@ o@@ sk@@ ele@@ ton , I can car@@ ry 2@@ 00 l@@ b@@ s. over v@@ ar@@ ied ter@@ ra@@ in for many hours ."
"I@@ ts f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble design allow@@ s for de@@ ep squ@@ ats , c@@ raw@@ ls and high-@@ ag@@ i@@ lity mov@@ em@@ ents ."

"E@@ y@@ th@@ or B@@ en@@ der : We are ready with our indu@@ stry part@@ ner to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce this de@@ vice , this new ex@@ o@@ sk@@ ele@@ ton this year ."
So this is for real .
"Now let &apos;s turn our he@@ ads towar@@ ds the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir us@@ ers , something that I &apos;m parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate about ."
There are 6@@ 8 million people est@@ im@@ ated to be in whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir@@ s wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de .
This is about one percent of the tot@@ al popul@@ ation .
And that &apos;s actually a con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative est@@ im@@ ate .
"We are talking here about , of@@ ten@@ times , very young individu@@ als with sp@@ in@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ur@@ ies , that in the pri@@ me of their life — 20@@ s , 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s — h@@ it a w@@ all and the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir &apos;s the only op@@ tion ."
But it is also the ag@@ ing popul@@ ation that is mul@@ ti@@ pl@@ ying in num@@ bers .
"And the only op@@ tion , pretty much — when it &apos;s stro@@ ke or other comp@@ lic@@ ations — is the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir ."
"And that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very suc@@ cess@@ ful in@@ tro@@ du@@ ction , I must say ."
So we thought we would start writing a br@@ and new ch@@ ap@@ ter of mo@@ bility .
"L@@ et me now in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to e@@ L@@ E@@ G@@ S that is wor@@ n by Am@@ an@@ da Bo@@ x@@ te@@ l that 1@@ 9 years ago was sp@@ in@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ red , and as a resul@@ t of that she has not been able to walk for 1@@ 9 years until now ."
( Applause ) Am@@ an@@ da Bo@@ x@@ te@@ l : Thank you . ( Applause )
E@@ B : Am@@ an@@ da is we@@ aring our e@@ L@@ E@@ G@@ S set .
It has sen@@ sor@@ s .
"It &apos;s completely n@@ on-@@ inv@@ a@@ sive , sen@@ sor@@ s in the c@@ ru@@ t@@ ch@@ es that sen@@ d sig@@ n@@ als back to our on@@ bo@@ ard computer that is sitting here at her back ."
"There are bat@@ tery pac@@ ks here as well that power mot@@ ors that are sitting at her hi@@ ps , as well as her k@@ ne@@ e jo@@ in@@ ts , that move her forward in this kind of smo@@ ot@@ h and very natural ga@@ it ."
A@@ B : I was 2@@ 4 years old and at the top of my g@@ ame when a fre@@ ak sum@@ mer@@ sa@@ ul@@ t while dow@@ n@@ hi@@ ll sk@@ i@@ ing par@@ al@@ y@@ zed me .
"In a sp@@ li@@ t second , I lost all sen@@ s@@ ation and movement be@@ low my pe@@ l@@ v@@ is ."

( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"E@@ B : A@@ s you can see , we have the technology , we have the pl@@ at@@ form@@ s to si@@ t down and have di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions with you ."
"It &apos;s in our h@@ ands , and we have all the poten@@ tial here to change the lives of future gener@@ ations — not only for the sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s , or for Am@@ an@@ da here and all the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir us@@ ers , but for everyone ."
A@@ B : Th@@ an@@ ks .
( Applause )
"In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been building the su@@ bur@@ b@@ s with a lot of un@@ inten@@ ded con@@ sequ@@ ences ."
And I &apos;m going to talk about some of those con@@ sequ@@ ences and just present a whole bu@@ n@@ ch of really interesting proje@@ cts that I think give us tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous reas@@ ons to be really op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic that the big design and develo@@ pment project of the next 50 years is going to be re@@ tro@@ fi@@ tting su@@ bur@@ bi@@ a .
"So whether it &apos;s re@@ develo@@ ping dy@@ ing mal@@ ls or re@@ -@@ in@@ ha@@ bi@@ ting de@@ ad bi@@ g@@ -@@ box sto@@ res or re@@ con@@ stru@@ cting we@@ t@@ l@@ ands out of par@@ king lots , I think the fact is the grow@@ ing number of em@@ p@@ ty and under@@ -@@ perform@@ ing , es@@ pe@@ cially re@@ ta@@ il , si@@ tes throu@@ gh@@ out su@@ bur@@ bi@@ a gi@@ ves us actually a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous opportunity to take our le@@ ast@@ -@@ susta@@ in@@ able land@@ s@@ cap@@ es right now and con@@ ver@@ t them into more susta@@ in@@ able places ."
"And in the process , what that allow@@ s us to do is to re@@ dire@@ ct a lot more of our grow@@ th back into ex@@ ist@@ ing communi@@ ties that could use a boo@@ st , and have the in@@ fra@@ structure in place , instead of contin@@ u@@ ing to te@@ ar down tre@@ es and to te@@ ar up the green space out at the ed@@ ges ."
So why is this important ?
"I think there are any number of reas@@ ons , and I &apos;m just going to not get into de@@ ta@@ il but men@@ tion a few ."
"J@@ ust from the perspe@@ ctive of clim@@ ate change , the a@@ ver@@ age urb@@ an dw@@ el@@ ler in the U.@@ S@@ ."
"@@ has about one@@ -@@ third the car@@ b@@ on fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int of the a@@ ver@@ age su@@ bur@@ b@@ an dw@@ el@@ ler , mo@@ st@@ ly because su@@ bur@@ b@@ ani@@ tes dri@@ ve a lot more , and living in de@@ t@@ ach@@ ed buil@@ dings , you have that much more ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or surface to le@@ ak energy out of ."
"So stri@@ ct@@ ly from a clim@@ ate change perspe@@ ctive , the cities are already relati@@ vely green ."
The big opportunity to redu@@ ce gre@@ en@@ house gas e@@ mis@@ sions is actually in urb@@ ani@@ z@@ ing the su@@ bur@@ b@@ s .
"A@@ ll that dri@@ ving that we &apos;ve been doing out in the su@@ bur@@ b@@ s , we have d@@ ou@@ b@@ led the amount of miles we dri@@ ve ."
It &apos;s incre@@ as@@ ed our depen@@ dence on fore@@ ig@@ n oil des@@ pi@@ te the ga@@ ins in fu@@ el ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy .
We &apos;re just dri@@ ving so much more ; we ha@@ ven &apos;t been able to keep up technologi@@ cally .
P@@ u@@ bli@@ c health is another reason to consi@@ der re@@ tro@@ fi@@ tting .
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers at the C@@ D@@ C and other places have incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly been lin@@ king su@@ bur@@ b@@ an develo@@ pment pat@@ ter@@ ns with se@@ d@@ ent@@ ary li@@ fe@@ sty@@ les .
"And those have been lin@@ ked then with the rather al@@ ar@@ ming , grow@@ ing r@@ ates of obe@@ sity , sh@@ own in these ma@@ ps here , and that obe@@ sity has also been tri@@ gg@@ ering great incre@@ ases in heart dise@@ ase and di@@ a@@ be@@ tes to the point where a child born today has a one@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ three ch@@ ance of develo@@ ping di@@ a@@ be@@ tes ."
"And that r@@ ate has been es@@ cal@@ ating at the same r@@ ate as children not wal@@ king to school any@@ more , again , because of our develo@@ pment pat@@ ter@@ ns ."
And then there &apos;s finally — there &apos;s the af@@ for@@ d@@ ability question .
"I mean , how af@@ for@@ d@@ able is it to contin@@ ue to live in su@@ bur@@ bi@@ a with ri@@ sing gas pri@@ ces ?"
"S@@ u@@ bur@@ b@@ an ex@@ pan@@ sion to che@@ a@@ p land , for the last 50 years — you know the che@@ a@@ p land out on the ed@@ ge — has hel@@ ped gener@@ ations of fam@@ il@@ ies en@@ jo@@ y the American dre@@ am ."
"But incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly , the sa@@ v@@ ings pro@@ mis@@ ed by dri@@ ve@@ -@@ ti@@ ll@@ -@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ qu@@ ali@@ fy af@@ for@@ d@@ ability — which is basically our model — those sa@@ v@@ ings are wi@@ ped out when you consi@@ der the transpor@@ tation co@@ sts ."
"For in@@ stance , here in At@@ lan@@ ta , about half of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds make between $ 20@@ ,000 and $ 5@@ 0,000 a year , and they are sp@@ ending 2@@ 9 percent of their in@@ come on h@@ ous@@ ing and 3@@ 2 percent on transpor@@ tation ."
"I mean , that &apos;s 200@@ 5 figu@@ res ."
That &apos;s before we got up to the four bu@@ cks a gal@@ l@@ on .
"You know , n@@ one of us really ten@@ d to do the mat@@ h on our transpor@@ tation co@@ sts , and they &apos;re not going down any time so@@ on ."
"W@@ he@@ ther you love su@@ bur@@ bi@@ a &apos;s le@@ af@@ y pri@@ vac@@ y or you h@@ ate its s@@ ou@@ l@@ less comm@@ er@@ cial stri@@ ps , there are reas@@ ons why it &apos;s important to re@@ tro@@ f@@ it ."
But is it prac@@ tical ?
I think it is .
"J@@ u@@ ne W@@ il@@ li@@ am@@ son and I have been resear@@ ching this top@@ ic for over a dec@@ ade , and we &apos;ve found over 80 v@@ ar@@ ied proje@@ cts ."
"But that they &apos;re really all market dri@@ ven , and what &apos;s dri@@ ving the market in particular — number one — is major demo@@ gra@@ phi@@ c shi@@ f@@ ts ."
"We all ten@@ d to think of su@@ bur@@ bi@@ a as this very fam@@ il@@ y@@ -@@ fo@@ c@@ used place , but that &apos;s really not the case any@@ more ."
"S@@ in@@ ce 2@@ 000 , already two@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ ds of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in su@@ bur@@ bi@@ a did not have kids in them ."
We just ha@@ ven &apos;t ca@@ u@@ ght up with the ac@@ tu@@ al reali@@ ties of this .
"The reas@@ ons for this have a lot to with the dom@@ in@@ ance of the two big demo@@ gra@@ phi@@ c grou@@ ps right now : the B@@ aby Bo@@ om@@ ers re@@ ti@@ ring — and then there &apos;s a ga@@ p , G@@ ener@@ ation X , which is a small gener@@ ation ."
They &apos;re still having kids — but G@@ ener@@ ation Y ha@@ sn &apos;t even started hi@@ tting chil@@ d-@@ re@@ aring age .
They &apos;re the other big gener@@ ation .
"So as a resul@@ t of that , demo@@ gra@@ ph@@ ers pre@@ di@@ ct that through 20@@ 25 , 7@@ 5 to 8@@ 5 percent of new hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds will not have kids in them ."
"And the market research , con@@ sum@@ er research , as@@ king the Bo@@ om@@ ers and G@@ en Y what it is they would like , what they would like to live in , tel@@ ls us there is going to be a huge de@@ m@@ and — and we &apos;re already seeing it — for more urb@@ an li@@ fe@@ sty@@ les within su@@ bur@@ bi@@ a ."
"That basically , the Bo@@ om@@ ers want to be able to age in place , and G@@ en Y would like to live an urb@@ an li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le , but most of their j@@ ob@@ s will contin@@ ue to be out in su@@ bur@@ bi@@ a ."
The other big dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c of change is the sh@@ e@@ er perform@@ ance of under@@ perform@@ ing as@@ ph@@ al@@ t .
"Now I keep thinking this would be a great name for an in@@ die ro@@ ck b@@ and , but develo@@ per@@ s gener@@ ally use it to ref@@ er to under@@ used par@@ king lots — and su@@ bur@@ bi@@ a is full of them ."
"When the post@@ war su@@ bur@@ b@@ s were first built out on the che@@ a@@ p land away from dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n , it made sense to just build surface par@@ king lots ."
"But those si@@ tes have now been le@@ ap@@ fro@@ gg@@ ed and le@@ ap@@ fro@@ gg@@ ed again , as we &apos;ve just contin@@ u@@ ed to spraw@@ l , and they now have a relati@@ vely cent@@ ral lo@@ cation ."
It no longer just makes sense .
That land is more val@@ u@@ able than just surface par@@ king lots .
"It now makes sense to go back in , build a de@@ ck and build up on those si@@ tes ."
"So what do you do with a de@@ ad mall , de@@ ad offi@@ ce par@@ k ?"
"It turns out , all sor@@ ts of things ."
"In a s@@ low econom@@ y like ours , re@@ -@@ in@@ ha@@ bi@@ tation is one of the more popul@@ ar strate@@ g@@ ies ."
So this happens to be a de@@ ad mall in St@@ . L@@ ou@@ is that &apos;s been re@@ -@@ in@@ ha@@ bi@@ ted as ar@@ t-@@ space .
"It &apos;s now home to arti@@ st studi@@ os , the@@ ater grou@@ ps , dance t@@ rou@@ p@@ es ."
"It &apos;s not pul@@ ling in as much ta@@ x re@@ ven@@ ue as it once was , but it &apos;s ser@@ ving its community ."
It &apos;s ke@@ e@@ ping the li@@ ghts on .
"It &apos;s be@@ coming , I think , a really great institu@@ tion ."
"O@@ ther mal@@ ls have been re@@ -@@ in@@ ha@@ bi@@ ted as n@@ ur@@ sing hom@@ es , as uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties , and as all v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of offi@@ ce space ."
"We also found a lot of exam@@ ples of de@@ ad bi@@ g@@ -@@ box sto@@ res that have been con@@ ver@@ ted into all sor@@ ts of communi@@ ty@@ -@@ ser@@ ving uses as well — lots of scho@@ ols , lots of ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es and lots of li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies like this one ."
"This was a little gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e , a F@@ o@@ od Li@@ on gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e , that is now a public li@@ br@@ ary ."
"In ad@@ di@@ tion to , I think , doing a beautiful ad@@ ap@@ tive re@@ use , they tor@@ e up some of the par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ es , put in bi@@ os@@ wal@@ es to colle@@ ct and cle@@ an the ru@@ no@@ ff , put in a lot more si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks to conne@@ ct to the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods ."
"And they &apos;ve made this , what was just a stor@@ e along a comm@@ er@@ cial stri@@ p , into a community ga@@ ther@@ ing space ."
"This one is a little L@@ -@@ sha@@ ped stri@@ p sh@@ op@@ ping cen@@ ter in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x , A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona ."
"R@@ e@@ ally all they did was they gave it a fre@@ sh co@@ at of b@@ right pa@@ int , a g@@ our@@ met gro@@ cer@@ y , and they put up a re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant in the old pos@@ t offi@@ ce ."
N@@ ever under@@ est@@ im@@ ate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a de@@ st@@ in@@ ation .
"It &apos;s been so suc@@ cess@@ ful , they &apos;ve now taken over the stri@@ p across the stre@@ et ."
"The real est@@ ate ads in the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od all very pro@@ ud@@ ly pro@@ c@@ la@@ im , &quot; W@@ al@@ king di@@ stance to L@@ e G@@ ran@@ de O@@ r@@ ange , &quot; because it provi@@ ded its neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od with what so@@ ci@@ ologi@@ sts like to call &quot; a third place . &quot;"
"If home is the first place and work is the second place , the third place is where you go to h@@ an@@ g out and build community ."
"And es@@ pe@@ cially as su@@ bur@@ bi@@ a is be@@ coming less cen@@ ter@@ ed on the family , the family hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , there &apos;s a real hun@@ ger for more third places ."
"So the most dra@@ m@@ atic re@@ tro@@ fi@@ ts are really those in the next c@@ ate@@ g@@ ory , the next strate@@ gy : re@@ develo@@ pment ."
"Now , during the bo@@ om , there were se@@ ver@@ al really dra@@ m@@ atic re@@ develo@@ pment proje@@ cts where the ori@@ gin@@ al building was sc@@ ra@@ ped to the ground and then the whole site was re@@ built at sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ tly gre@@ ater den@@ sity , a sort of comp@@ act , wal@@ k@@ able urb@@ an neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods ."
But some of them have been much more incre@@ ment@@ al .
"This is M@@ ash@@ pe@@ e C@@ om@@ m@@ ons , the ol@@ d@@ est re@@ tro@@ f@@ it that we &apos;ve found ."
"And it &apos;s just incre@@ ment@@ ally , over the last 20 years , built urb@@ ani@@ sm on top of its par@@ king lots ."
So the black and white ph@@ oto shows the simple 60 &apos;s stri@@ p sh@@ op@@ ping cen@@ ter .
"And then the ma@@ ps ab@@ o@@ ve that show its gra@@ du@@ al trans@@ form@@ ation into a comp@@ act , mi@@ x@@ ed@@ -@@ use New En@@ gl@@ and vi@@ ll@@ age , and it has pl@@ ans now that have been appro@@ ved for it to conne@@ ct to new resi@@ den@@ tial neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods across the ar@@ ter@@ i@@ als and over to the other side ."
"So , you know , sometimes it &apos;s incre@@ ment@@ al ."
"S@@ ome@@ times , it &apos;s all at once ."
"This is another in@@ fi@@ ll project on the par@@ king lots , this one of an offi@@ ce par@@ k outside of W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ ."
"When Me@@ tro@@ ra@@ il ex@@ pan@@ ded tran@@ si@@ t into the su@@ bur@@ b@@ s and open@@ ed a st@@ ation ne@@ ar@@ by to this site , the ow@@ n@@ ers decided to build a new par@@ king de@@ ck and then in@@ ser@@ t on top of their surface lots a new Ma@@ in St@@ re@@ et , se@@ ver@@ al a@@ part@@ ments and con@@ do buil@@ dings , while ke@@ e@@ ping the ex@@ ist@@ ing offi@@ ce buil@@ dings ."
Here is the site in 19@@ 40 : It was just a little far@@ m in the vi@@ ll@@ age of H@@ y@@ att@@ s@@ vi@@ l@@ le .
"B@@ y 19@@ 80 , it had been sub@@ di@@ vi@@ ded into a big mall on one side and the offi@@ ce par@@ k on the other and then some bu@@ f@@ f@@ er si@@ tes for a li@@ br@@ ary and a ch@@ ur@@ ch to the far right ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , the tran@@ si@@ t , the Ma@@ in St@@ re@@ et and the new h@@ ous@@ ing have all been built ."
"E@@ ven@@ tually , I expe@@ ct that the stre@@ ets will probably ex@@ ten@@ d through a re@@ develo@@ pment of the mall ."
P@@ l@@ ans have already been an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced for a lot of those gar@@ den a@@ part@@ ments ab@@ o@@ ve the mall to be re@@ develo@@ ped .
T@@ ran@@ si@@ t is a big dri@@ ver of re@@ tro@@ fi@@ ts .
So here &apos;s what it looks like .
You can sort of see the funk@@ y new con@@ do buil@@ dings in between the offi@@ ce buil@@ dings and the public space and the new Ma@@ in St@@ re@@ et .
"This one is one of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ tes , B@@ el@@ m@@ ar ."
I think they really built an at@@ trac@@ tive place here and have just em@@ plo@@ yed al@@ l-@@ green con@@ stru@@ ction .
There &apos;s mas@@ sive P@@ .@@ V@@ . ar@@ ra@@ ys on the ro@@ of@@ s as well as wind tur@@ bin@@ es .
This was a very large mall on a hundre@@ d-@@ ac@@ re super@@ blo@@ ck .
"It &apos;s now 2@@ 2 wal@@ k@@ able urb@@ an blo@@ cks with public stre@@ ets , two public par@@ ks , eight bu@@ s lin@@ es and a r@@ ange of h@@ ous@@ ing typ@@ es , and so it &apos;s really given L@@ ak@@ e@@ wood , Col@@ or@@ a@@ do the dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n that this particular su@@ bur@@ b never had ."
Here was the mall in its he@@ y@@ day .
They had their pro@@ m in the mall . They lo@@ ved their mall .
So here &apos;s the site in 19@@ 7@@ 5 with the mall .
"B@@ y 199@@ 5 , the mall has d@@ ied ."
The de@@ part@@ ment stor@@ e has been ke@@ pt — and we found this was true in many c@@ ases .
The de@@ part@@ ment sto@@ res are mul@@ ti@@ story ; they &apos;re better built .
They &apos;re e@@ asy to be re@@ -@@ ad@@ ap@@ ted .
But the one story stuff ...
that &apos;s really history .
So here it is at proje@@ cted buil@@ d-@@ out .
"This project , I think , has great conne@@ cti@@ vity to the ex@@ ist@@ ing neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods ."
"It &apos;s provi@@ ding 1@@ ,@@ 500 hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds with the op@@ tion of a more urb@@ an li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le ."
It &apos;s about two@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ ds built out right now .
Here &apos;s what the new Ma@@ in St@@ re@@ et looks like .
"It &apos;s very suc@@ cess@@ ful , and it &apos;s hel@@ ped to pro@@ m@@ pt — eight of the 1@@ 3 regi@@ onal mal@@ ls in D@@ en@@ ver have now , or have an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced pl@@ ans to be , re@@ tro@@ fi@@ t@@ ted ."
But it &apos;s important to not@@ e that all of this re@@ tro@@ fi@@ tting is not oc@@ cur@@ ring — just bu@@ ll@@ do@@ z@@ ers are coming and just pl@@ ow@@ ing down the whole city .
"No , it &apos;s po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts of wal@@ k@@ ability on the si@@ tes of under@@ -@@ perform@@ ing pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"And so it &apos;s gi@@ ving people more cho@@ i@@ ces , but it &apos;s not taking away cho@@ i@@ ces ."
But it &apos;s also not really enough to just create po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts of wal@@ k@@ ability .
You want to also try to get more syst@@ e@@ mi@@ c trans@@ form@@ ation .
We need to also re@@ tro@@ f@@ it the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors themselves .
So this is one that has been re@@ tro@@ fi@@ t@@ ted in C@@ alifor@@ nia .
"They took the comm@@ er@@ cial stri@@ p sh@@ own on the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ white images be@@ low , and they built a b@@ ou@@ le@@ v@@ ard that has become the Ma@@ in St@@ re@@ et for their tow@@ n ."
"And it &apos;s trans@@ form@@ ed from being an u@@ g@@ ly , un@@ sa@@ fe , un@@ de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble ad@@ dre@@ ss , to be@@ coming a beautiful , at@@ trac@@ tive , di@@ gni@@ f@@ ied sort of good ad@@ dre@@ ss ."
"I mean now we &apos;re hop@@ ing we start to see it ; they &apos;ve already built C@@ ity H@@ all , at@@ trac@@ ted two hot@@ els ."
I could imagine beautiful h@@ ous@@ ing going up along there without te@@ aring down another t@@ ree .
"So there &apos;s a lot of great things , but I &apos;d love to see more cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors getting re@@ tro@@ fi@@ tting ."
But den@@ si@@ fi@@ cation is not going to work every@@ where .
S@@ ome@@ times re@@ -@@ gre@@ ening is really the better answer .
"There &apos;s a lot to learn from suc@@ cess@@ ful land@@ ban@@ king progra@@ ms in cities like F@@ lin@@ t , Mi@@ chi@@ g@@ an ."
There &apos;s also a bur@@ ge@@ on@@ ing su@@ bur@@ b@@ an far@@ ming movement — sort of vi@@ ct@@ ory gar@@ den@@ s me@@ ets the Inter@@ net .
"But per@@ haps one of the most important re@@ -@@ gre@@ ening aspe@@ cts is the opportunity to re@@ stor@@ e the local e@@ co@@ logy , as in this example outside of M@@ in@@ ne@@ a@@ pol@@ is ."
"When the sh@@ op@@ ping cen@@ ter d@@ ied , the city re@@ sto@@ red the site &apos;s ori@@ gin@@ al we@@ t@@ l@@ ands , cre@@ ating l@@ ak@@ e@@ front pro@@ per@@ ty , which then at@@ trac@@ ted pri@@ v@@ ate inv@@ est@@ ment , the first pri@@ v@@ ate inv@@ est@@ ment to this very low@@ -@@ in@@ come neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od in over 40 years ."
So they &apos;ve man@@ aged to both re@@ stor@@ e the local e@@ co@@ logy and the local econom@@ y at the same time .
This is another re@@ -@@ gre@@ ening example .
It also makes sense in very stron@@ g marke@@ ts .
This one in Se@@ at@@ tle is on the site of a mall par@@ king lot ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent to a new tran@@ si@@ t stop .
And the wa@@ v@@ y line is a pat@@ h al@@ on@@ g@@ side a cre@@ ek that has now been da@@ y@@ li@@ t .
The cre@@ ek had been cul@@ ver@@ ted under the par@@ king lot .
But da@@ y@@ li@@ gh@@ ting our cre@@ e@@ ks really impro@@ ves their water qu@@ ality and con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions to ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at .
So I &apos;ve sh@@ own you some of the first gener@@ ation of re@@ tro@@ fi@@ ts .
What &apos;s next ?
I think we have three challen@@ ges for the future .
The first is to pl@@ an re@@ tro@@ fi@@ tting much more syst@@ e@@ mi@@ cally at the me@@ tro@@ po@@ lit@@ an scale .
We need to be able to tar@@ get which are@@ as really should be re@@ -@@ gre@@ en@@ ed .
W@@ here should we be re@@ develo@@ ping ?
And where should we be en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing re@@ -@@ in@@ ha@@ bi@@ tation ?
These sli@@ des just show two images from a lar@@ ger project that looked at trying to do that for At@@ lan@@ ta .
I led a team that was asked to imagine At@@ lan@@ ta 100 years from now .
"And we cho@@ se to try to re@@ verse spraw@@ l through three simple mo@@ ves — ex@@ pen@@ sive , but simple ."
"One , in a hundre@@ d years , tran@@ si@@ t on all major ra@@ il and ro@@ ad cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors ."
"T@@ wo , in a hundre@@ d years , thous@@ and fo@@ ot bu@@ f@@ f@@ ers on all stre@@ am cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors ."
"It &apos;s a little extre@@ me , but we &apos;ve got a little water problem ."
"In a hundre@@ d years , sub@@ di@@ vi@@ sions that simply end up too close to water or too far from tran@@ si@@ t won &apos;t be vi@@ able ."
And so we &apos;ve created the e@@ co@@ -@@ ac@@ re trans@@ fer@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ trans@@ f@@ er develo@@ pment ri@@ ghts to the tran@@ si@@ t cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors and al@@ low the re@@ -@@ gre@@ ening of those form@@ er sub@@ di@@ vi@@ sions for food and energy produ@@ ction .
So the second challen@@ ge is to impro@@ ve the archite@@ ctu@@ ral design qu@@ ality of the re@@ tro@@ fi@@ ts .
"And I close with this image of de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y in action : This is a prote@@ st that &apos;s happening on a re@@ tro@@ f@@ it in S@@ il@@ ver S@@ pr@@ ing , Mar@@ y@@ land on an A@@ stro@@ tur@@ f tow@@ n green ."
"Now , re@@ tro@@ fi@@ ts are often ac@@ c@@ used of being exam@@ ples of f@@ au@@ x dow@@ n@@ tow@@ ns and in@@ st@@ ant urb@@ ani@@ sm , and not without reason ; you don &apos;t get much more ph@@ ony than an A@@ stro@@ tur@@ f tow@@ n green ."
"I have to say , these are very hy@@ bri@@ d places ."
They are new but trying to look old .
"They have urb@@ an stre@@ et@@ s@@ cap@@ es , but su@@ bur@@ b@@ an par@@ king r@@ ati@@ os ."
"Th@@ e@@ ir popul@@ ations are more di@@ verse than ty@@ pi@@ cal su@@ bur@@ bi@@ a , but they &apos;re less di@@ verse than cities ."
"And they are public places , but that are man@@ aged by pri@@ v@@ ate comp@@ an@@ ies ."
And just the surface ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance are often — like the A@@ stro@@ tur@@ f here — they make me win@@ ce .
"So , you know , I mean I &apos;m gl@@ ad that the urb@@ ani@@ sm is doing its job ."
"The fact that a prote@@ st is happening really does mean that the la@@ y@@ out of the blo@@ cks , the stre@@ ets and blo@@ cks , the pu@@ tting in of public space , com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ed as it may be , is still a really great thing ."
But we &apos;ve got to get the archite@@ cture better .
The fin@@ al challen@@ ge is for all of you .
"I want you to jo@@ in the prote@@ st and start de@@ man@@ ding more susta@@ in@@ able su@@ bur@@ b@@ an places — more susta@@ in@@ able places , per@@ i@@ od ."
"But cul@@ tur@@ ally , we ten@@ d to think that dow@@ n@@ tow@@ ns should be dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c , and we expe@@ ct that ."
But we se@@ em to have an expe@@ ct@@ ation that the su@@ bur@@ b@@ s should fore@@ ver re@@ ma@@ in f@@ roz@@ en in whatever ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cent form they were first given bir@@ th to .
"It &apos;s time to let them gro@@ w up , so I want you to all sup@@ port the z@@ on@@ ing chang@@ es , the ro@@ ad d@@ ie@@ ts , the in@@ fra@@ structure impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents and the re@@ tro@@ fi@@ ts that are coming so@@ on to a neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ne@@ ar you ."
Thank you .
How do they dif@@ f@@ er from the rest of us ?
"In two of the three great ar@@ en@@ as of life , by the time L@@ en was 30 , L@@ en was en@@ or@@ m@@ ously suc@@ cess@@ ful ."
"B@@ y the time he was 20 , he was an op@@ tions tra@@ der ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , in play , he &apos;s a national ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on bri@@ dge pla@@ y@@ er ."
"And the reason he was , was that L@@ en is a c@@ old fish ."
What you get out of that is not smi@@ le@@ y@@ -@@ ness .
"So , that &apos;s the second pat@@ h ."
"This is the most v@@ ener@@ able of the happ@@ in@@ ess@@ es , tra@@ di@@ tion@@ ally ."
"Now , OK , you can open your eyes ."
"And we ask the question as a fun@@ ction of the three different lives , how much life s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion do you get ?"
The pur@@ su@@ it of me@@ an@@ ing is the stron@@ gest .
"As an A@@ ra@@ b fe@@ m@@ ale photograph@@ er , I have always found am@@ ple in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation for my proje@@ cts in per@@ s@@ onal exper@@ ien@@ ces ."
"The pas@@ sion I develo@@ ped for know@@ le@@ dge , which allow@@ ed me to bre@@ ak bar@@ r@@ ier@@ s towar@@ ds a better life was the moti@@ vation for my project I Re@@ ad I W@@ ri@@ te ."
"O@@ n@@ ly after expla@@ ining to them how their stories might in@@ flu@@ ence other women &apos;s lives , how they would become ro@@ le mode@@ ls for their own community , did some ag@@ ree ."
"S@@ e@@ e@@ king a col@@ labor@@ ative and ref@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ve appro@@ ach , I asked them to write their own words and ideas on prin@@ ts of their own images ."
"Th@@ ose images were then sh@@ ared in some of the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , and worked to inspi@@ re and moti@@ v@@ ate other women going through si@@ mi@@ lar edu@@ c@@ ations and situ@@ ations ."
"When we first met , she was bar@@ ely able to write her name ."
"O@@ f course , that &apos;s not why U@@ m@@ m E@@ l-@@ S@@ a@@ ad jo@@ ined the program ."
"Now , after the re@@ v@@ olution , we have a new one every single day . &quot; &quot; A@@ s@@ ma was re@@ fer@@ ring to the ri@@ se of religi@@ ous fundam@@ ent@@ ali@@ sm in the regi@@ on , which is another ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le to women in particular ."
That mar@@ ri@@ age la@@ st@@ ed for a year .
"A@@ t 14 , she became the third wi@@ fe of a 6@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old man , and by the time she was 18 , she was a di@@ v@@ or@@ ced mother of three ."
"H@@ er go@@ al is to find a job , r@@ ent a place to live in , and bring her kids back with her ."
"The A@@ ra@@ b st@@ ates are going through tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous change , and the stru@@ gg@@ les women face are over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming ."
"J@@ ust like the women I photograph@@ ed , I had to over@@ come many bar@@ r@@ ier@@ s to be@@ coming the photograph@@ er I am today , many people along the way tel@@ ling me what I can and cannot do ."
"U@@ m@@ m E@@ l-@@ S@@ a@@ ad , A@@ s@@ ma and F@@ a@@ y@@ za , and many women across the A@@ ra@@ b world , show that it is possible to over@@ come bar@@ r@@ ier@@ s to education , which they know is the best means to a better future ."
"And here I would like to end with a quot@@ e by Y@@ as@@ m@@ ine , one of the four acti@@ vi@@ st women I inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ed in T@@ uni@@ si@@ a ."
"@@ Y@@ as@@ m@@ ine wro@@ te , &quot; &quot; Q@@ u@@ esti@@ on your con@@ vi@@ ctions ."
"B@@ e who you to want to be , not who they want you to be ."
( Applause )
"A@@ lli@@ son H@@ un@@ t : My three minutes ha@@ sn &apos;t started yet , has it ?"
"Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : No , you can &apos;t start the three minutes ."
"R@@ es@@ et the three minutes , that &apos;s just not fa@@ ir ."
"A@@ H : Oh my God , it &apos;s har@@ sh up here ."
I mean I &apos;m ner@@ v@@ ous enough as it is .
But I am not as ner@@ v@@ ous as I was five weeks ago .
F@@ i@@ ve weeks ago I had tot@@ al hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ement sur@@ g@@ ery .
Do you know that sur@@ g@@ ery ?
"E@@ le@@ ctri@@ c saw , power dri@@ ll , tot@@ ally dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing un@@ less you &apos;re Davi@@ d B@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ y , in which case it &apos;s all tru@@ th and beau@@ ty ."
"S@@ ure Davi@@ d , if it &apos;s not your hi@@ p , it &apos;s tru@@ th and beau@@ ty ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , I did have a really big epi@@ ph@@ any around the situ@@ ation , so Ch@@ ris in@@ vi@@ ted me to tell you about it ."
But first you need to know two things about me .
J@@ ust two things .
"I &apos;m C@@ an@@ ad@@ i@@ an , and I &apos;m the youn@@ gest of seven kids ."
"Now , in C@@ an@@ ada , we have that great health@@ care system ."
That means we get our new hi@@ ps for f@@ ree .
"And being the youn@@ gest of seven , I have never been at the front of the line for anything . OK ?"
So my hi@@ p had been h@@ ur@@ ting me for years .
"I finally went to the do@@ ctor , which was f@@ ree ."
"And she re@@ fer@@ red me to an or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c sur@@ ge@@ on , also f@@ ree ."
F@@ in@@ ally got to see him after 10 months of wai@@ ting — almost a year .
That is what f@@ ree gets you .
"I met the sur@@ ge@@ on , and he took some f@@ ree X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys , and I got a good look at them . And you know , even I could tell my hi@@ p was bad , and I actually work in marke@@ ting ."
"So he said , &quot; &quot; A@@ lli@@ son , we &apos;ve got to get you on the table ."
I &apos;m going to re@@ place your hi@@ p — it &apos;s about an 1@@ 8@@ -@@ mon@@ th wa@@ it . &quot; &quot; 18 more months .
"I &apos;d already wai@@ ted 10 months , and I had to wa@@ it 18 more months ."
"You know , it &apos;s such a long wa@@ it that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TE@@ D@@ s ."
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hi@@ p for this TED .
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hi@@ p for TE@@ D@@ G@@ lob@@ al in Africa .
I would not have my new hi@@ p for TE@@ D@@ 200@@ 8 .
I would still be on my bad hi@@ p . That was so disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting .
"So , I left his offi@@ ce and I was wal@@ king through the ho@@ spit@@ al , and that &apos;s when I had my epi@@ ph@@ any ."
This youn@@ gest of seven had to get her@@ self to the front of the line .
Oh ye@@ ah .
C@@ an I tell you how un@@ -@@ C@@ an@@ ad@@ i@@ an that is ?
We do not think that way .
We don &apos;t talk about it . It &apos;s not even a consi@@ der@@ ation .
"In fact , when we &apos;re tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing ab@@ ro@@ ad , it &apos;s how we iden@@ ti@@ fy fel@@ low C@@ an@@ ad@@ i@@ ans ."
"&quot; Af@@ ter you . &quot; &quot; Oh , no , no . Af@@ ter you . &quot;"
"H@@ ey , are you from C@@ an@@ ada ? &quot; &quot; Oh , me too ! H@@ i ! &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at ! E@@ x@@ cel@@ l@@ ent ! &quot;"
"So no , sud@@ den@@ ly I wasn &apos;t a@@ verse to bu@@ tting any ge@@ e@@ z@@ er off the li@@ st ."
"S@@ ome 7@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old who wanted his new hi@@ p so he could be back g@@ ol@@ f@@ ing , or gar@@ den@@ ing ."
"No , no . F@@ ron@@ t of the line ."
"So by now I was wal@@ king the lob@@ by , and of course , that h@@ ur@@ t , because of my hi@@ p , and I kind of needed a sig@@ n ."
And I saw a sig@@ n .
"In the win@@ do@@ w of the ho@@ spit@@ al &apos;s t@@ iny gi@@ ft sho@@ p there was a sig@@ n that said , &quot; &quot; V@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers Ne@@ ed@@ ed . &quot; &quot; H@@ m@@ m ."
"Well , they sig@@ ned me up im@@ medi@@ ately ."
"No re@@ fer@@ ence che@@ cks . N@@ one of the usu@@ al back@@ ground stuff , no ."
They were des@@ per@@ ate for vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers because the a@@ ver@@ age age of the vol@@ un@@ te@@ er at the ho@@ spit@@ al gi@@ ft sho@@ p was 7@@ 5 .
Yeah . They needed some young blo@@ od .
"So , next thing you know , I had my b@@ right blue vol@@ un@@ te@@ er v@@ est , I had my ph@@ oto I@@ D , and I was fully tra@@ ined by my 8@@ 9@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old b@@ os@@ s ."
I worked alone .
E@@ very F@@ ri@@ day morning I was at the gi@@ ft sho@@ p .
"W@@ hi@@ le r@@ ing@@ ing in ho@@ spit@@ al st@@ af@@ f &apos;s T@@ ic T@@ ac@@ s , I &apos;d c@@ as@@ u@@ ally ask , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I &apos;d tell them , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m getting my hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ed — in 18 months ."
"It &apos;s g@@ on@@ na be so great when the pa@@ in stop@@ s . O@@ w ! &quot; &quot; All the st@@ af@@ f got to know the p@@ lu@@ ck@@ y , young vol@@ un@@ te@@ er ."
"My next sur@@ ge@@ on &apos;s ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment was , co@@ in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , right after a shi@@ ft at the gi@@ ft sho@@ p ."
"So , natur@@ ally , I had my v@@ est and my iden@@ ti@@ fi@@ cation ."
I dra@@ ped them c@@ as@@ u@@ ally over the cha@@ ir in the do@@ ctor &apos;s offi@@ ce .
"And you know , when he wal@@ ked in , I could just tell that he saw them ."
"M@@ om@@ ents later , I had a sur@@ g@@ ery d@@ ate just weeks away , and a big f@@ at pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ption for P@@ er@@ co@@ c@@ et ."
"Now , word on the stre@@ et was that it was actually my vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering that got me to the front of the line ."
"And , you know , I &apos;m not even as@@ ha@@ med of that ."
T@@ wo reas@@ ons .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , I am going to take such good care of this new hi@@ p ."
"But also I inten@@ d to sti@@ ck with the vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering , which actually le@@ ads me to the bi@@ ggest epi@@ ph@@ any of them all ."
"E@@ ven when a C@@ an@@ ad@@ i@@ an che@@ ats the system , they do it in a way that b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts society ."
"You know , there &apos;s a small country ne@@ st@@ led in the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ an M@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins , far from these beautiful m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins , where the people of the K@@ ing@@ dom of B@@ h@@ ut@@ an have decided to do something different , which is to meas@@ ure their g@@ ross national happ@@ iness rather than their g@@ ross national produ@@ ct ."
And why not ?
"A@@ f@@ ter all , happ@@ iness is not just a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge for the lu@@ ck@@ y few , but a fundam@@ ent@@ al human right for all ."
And what is happ@@ iness ?
Ha@@ pp@@ iness is the fre@@ e@@ dom of cho@@ ice .
"The fre@@ e@@ dom to cho@@ se where to live , what to do , what to bu@@ y , what to se@@ ll , from wh@@ om , to wh@@ om , when and how ."
W@@ here does cho@@ ice come from ?
"And who gets to ex@@ pre@@ ss it , and how do we ex@@ pre@@ ss it ?"
"Well , one way to ex@@ pre@@ ss cho@@ ice is through the market ."
"W@@ el@@ l-@@ fun@@ cti@@ on@@ ing marke@@ ts provi@@ de cho@@ i@@ ces , and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , the ability to ex@@ pre@@ ss one &apos;s pur@@ su@@ it for happ@@ iness ."
"The great Indi@@ an econ@@ omi@@ st , A@@ mar@@ ty@@ a S@@ en , was aw@@ ar@@ ded the N@@ obe@@ l pri@@ ze for de@@ mon@@ str@@ ating that fam@@ ine is not so much about the avail@@ ability of food su@@ pp@@ ly , but rather the ability to ac@@ qui@@ re or enti@@ tle on@@ es@@ el@@ f to that food through the market ."
"In 19@@ 8@@ 4 , in what can only be consi@@ der@@ ed one of the gre@@ at@@ est cri@@ mes of hum@@ ani@@ ty , ne@@ ar@@ ly one million people d@@ ied of star@@ vation in my country of bir@@ th , E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia ."
"N@@ ot because there was not enough food — because there was actually a sur@@ p@@ lu@@ s of food in the fer@@ ti@@ le regi@@ ons of the s@@ outh par@@ ts of the country — but because in the nor@@ th , people could not ac@@ cess or enti@@ tle themselves to that food ."
That was a tur@@ ning point for my life .
"Mo@@ st Afri@@ cans today , by far , are farm@@ ers ."
"And most of Africa &apos;s farm@@ ers are , by and large , small farm@@ ers in terms of land that they oper@@ ate , and very , very small farm@@ ers in terms of the ca@@ pi@@ tal they have at their di@@ spos@@ al ."
"A@@ f@@ ri@@ can agri@@ culture today is am@@ ong , or is , the most under@@ -@@ ca@@ pit@@ aliz@@ ed in the world ."
"O@@ n@@ ly seven percent of ar@@ able land in Africa is ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ated , com@@ par@@ ed to 40 percent in A@@ si@@ a ."
"A@@ f@@ ri@@ can farm@@ ers only use some 2@@ 2 ki@@ lo@@ gra@@ ms of fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er per he@@ ct@@ are , com@@ par@@ ed to 1@@ 4@@ 4 in A@@ si@@ a ."
Ro@@ ad den@@ sity is six times gre@@ ater in A@@ si@@ a than it is in ru@@ ral Africa .
"There are eight times more trac@@ t@@ ors in L@@ at@@ in America , and three times more trac@@ t@@ ors in A@@ si@@ a , than in Africa ."
"The small farm@@ er in Africa today lives a life without much cho@@ ice , and ther@@ e@@ fore without much fre@@ e@@ dom ."
H@@ is li@@ ve@@ li@@ ho@@ od is pre@@ de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed by the con@@ di@@ tions of gr@@ in@@ ding po@@ ver@@ ty .
"He comes to the market when pri@@ ces are low@@ est , with the me@@ ag@@ er f@@ ru@@ its of his hard lab@@ or , just after the har@@ v@@ est , because he has no cho@@ ice ."
"S@@ he comes back to the market some months later , when pri@@ ces are high@@ est , in what we call the le@@ an se@@ as@@ on — when food is sc@@ ar@@ ce — because she has to fe@@ ed her family and has no cho@@ ice ."
"The real question is , how can marke@@ ts be develo@@ ped in ru@@ ral Africa to har@@ ness the power of in@@ no@@ vation and ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship that we know ex@@ ist@@ s ?"
"A@@ no@@ ther not@@ able econ@@ omi@@ st , Th@@ e@@ od@@ ore S@@ ch@@ ul@@ t@@ z , in 19@@ 7@@ 4 won the N@@ obe@@ l pri@@ ze for de@@ mon@@ str@@ ating that farm@@ ers are ef@@ fi@@ cient , but po@@ or ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ ing , in fact , that farm@@ ers are r@@ ational and pro@@ fi@@ t-@@ min@@ ded just like everybody else ."
"Well , we don &apos;t need , now , any more N@@ obe@@ l pri@@ z@@ es to know that farm@@ ers want a fa@@ ir sha@@ ke at the market and want to make money , just like everyone else ."
"And one thing is clear , which is at least now we know that Africa is open for business ."
And that business is agri@@ culture .
"O@@ ver two de@@ ca@@ des ago , the world in@@ si@@ st@@ ed to Africa that marke@@ ts must be li@@ ber@@ aliz@@ ed , that econom@@ ies must be stru@@ c@@ tur@@ ally ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ed ."
This me@@ ant that govern@@ ments were to re@@ move themselves from the business of bu@@ ying and sel@@ ling — which they did rather in@@ ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ tly — and let the pri@@ v@@ ate market do its mag@@ ic .
"Well , what happened over the last 25 years ?"
D@@ id Africa fe@@ ed itself ?
D@@ id our farm@@ ers turn into high@@ ly produ@@ ctive comm@@ er@@ cial ac@@ t@@ ors ?
"I think we &apos;re all in this room , probably , because we know that , in fact , Africa is the only regi@@ on in the world where hun@@ ger and mal@@ n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion are proje@@ cted to go up over the next 10 years , where the food im@@ port bi@@ ll is now d@@ ou@@ ble what it was 20 years ago , where food produ@@ ction per ca@@ pi@@ ta has st@@ ag@@ nat@@ ed , and where fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er use has dec@@ lin@@ ed rather than incre@@ as@@ ed ."
So why didn &apos;t agri@@ culture marke@@ ts per@@ form to expe@@ ct@@ ations ?
"The market re@@ form@@ s pro@@ m@@ p@@ ted by the W@@ est — and I &apos;ve spent some 15 years tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing around the contin@@ ent doing research on agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral marke@@ ts , and have inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ed tra@@ ders in 10 to 15 countries in this contin@@ ent , hundre@@ ds of tra@@ ders — trying to understand what went wrong with our market re@@ form ."
And it seem@@ s to me that the re@@ form@@ s might have th@@ row@@ n the b@@ aby out with the b@@ ath water .
"L@@ i@@ ke its agri@@ culture , Africa &apos;s marke@@ ts are high@@ ly under@@ -@@ ca@@ pit@@ aliz@@ ed and in@@ ef@@ fi@@ cient ."
"We know from our work around the contin@@ ent that trans@@ action co@@ sts of re@@ ach@@ ing the market , and the ri@@ sk@@ s of trans@@ ac@@ ting in ru@@ ral , agri@@ culture marke@@ ts , are extre@@ me@@ ly high ."
"In fact , only one third of agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral out@@ put produ@@ ced in Africa even re@@ ach@@ es the market ."
"A@@ f@@ ri@@ ca &apos;s marke@@ ts are we@@ ak not only because of we@@ ak in@@ fra@@ structure in terms of ro@@ ads and tele@@ communi@@ c@@ ations , but also because of the vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al ab@@ sen@@ ce of ne@@ cess@@ ary market institu@@ tions , such as market information , gra@@ des and stan@@ dar@@ ds , and reli@@ able ways to conne@@ ct bu@@ y@@ ers and sel@@ l@@ ers ."
"Because of this , com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty bu@@ y@@ ers and sel@@ l@@ ers ty@@ pi@@ cally trans@@ act in small cir@@ cles , in nar@@ row net@@ works of people they know and tr@@ ust ."
"And because of that , as gra@@ in chang@@ es h@@ ands — and I &apos;ve meas@@ u@@ red that it chang@@ es h@@ ands four , five times in its tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory from the farm@@ er to the con@@ sum@@ er — every time it chang@@ es h@@ ands — and I &apos;ve seen this all over ru@@ ral Africa — it also chang@@ es s@@ ac@@ ks ."
And I thought that was incredi@@ bly pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar .
And really realized that that was because — as tra@@ ders would tell me over and over — that &apos;s the only way people know what they &apos;re getting in terms of the qu@@ anti@@ ty and the produ@@ ct qu@@ ality .
"And that actually has huge im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations for the ability of marke@@ ts to quickly re@@ spo@@ nd to pri@@ ce sig@@ n@@ als , and situ@@ ations where there are de@@ fi@@ ci@@ ts , for example ."
It also has very high cost im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations .
"I have meas@@ u@@ red that 2@@ 6 percent of the marke@@ ting mar@@ g@@ in is simply du@@ e to the fact that , because of the ab@@ sen@@ ce of gra@@ des and stan@@ dar@@ ds and market information , s@@ ac@@ ks have to be con@@ stan@@ tly changed ."
And this le@@ ads to very high hand@@ ling co@@ sts .
"For their part , small farm@@ ers , who produ@@ ce the bu@@ l@@ k of our agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral out@@ put in Africa , come to the market with vi@@ r@@ tually no information at all — bl@@ ind — tru@@ st@@ ing that they &apos;re going to have some sort of de@@ m@@ and for their produ@@ ce , and completely at the mer@@ cy of the mer@@ ch@@ an@@ ts in the only market , the ne@@ ar@@ est local market they know — where they &apos;re u@@ na@@ ble to neg@@ oti@@ ate better pri@@ ces or redu@@ ce their ri@@ sk ."
"S@@ pe@@ aking of ri@@ sk , we have seen that pri@@ ce vol@@ ati@@ lity of food cro@@ ps in Africa is the high@@ est in the world ."
"In Africa , small farm@@ ers be@@ ar the bru@@ n@@ t of this ri@@ sk ."
"In fact , in my view , there is no regi@@ on of the world and no per@@ i@@ od in history that farm@@ ers have been expe@@ cted to be@@ ar the kind of market ri@@ sk that Africa &apos;s farm@@ ers have to be@@ ar ."
"And in my view , there is simply no place in the world that has grow@@ n its agri@@ culture on the kind of ri@@ sk that our farm@@ ers in Africa today face ."
"In E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , for example , the v@@ ari@@ ation in ma@@ i@@ ze pri@@ ces from year to year is as much as 50 percent an@@ nu@@ ally ."
"This kind of market ri@@ sk is min@@ d-@@ bog@@ gl@@ ing , and has dire@@ ct im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations for not only the in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves of farm@@ ers to inv@@ est in high@@ er produ@@ cti@@ vity technology , such as moder@@ n se@@ eds and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , but also dire@@ ct im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations for food secu@@ ri@@ ty ."
"To give you an example , between 200@@ 1 and 200@@ 2 , E@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ an ma@@ i@@ ze farm@@ ers produ@@ ced two years of bu@@ m@@ per har@@ v@@ est ."
"That in turn , because of the we@@ ak marke@@ ting system , led to an 80 percent col@@ lap@@ se in ma@@ i@@ ze pri@@ ces in the country ."
This made it un@@ pro@@ fi@@ table for some farm@@ ers to even har@@ v@@ est the gra@@ in from the fie@@ l@@ ds .
"And we cal@@ cu@@ lated that some 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 t@@ ons of gra@@ in was left in the fie@@ l@@ ds to ro@@ t in early 200@@ 2 ."
"N@@ ot six months later , in Ju@@ ly 200@@ 2 , E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced a major food cri@@ sis , to the same pro@@ por@@ tions as 19@@ 8@@ 4 : 14 million people at ri@@ sk of star@@ vation ."
"What also happened that year is in the are@@ as where there were good ra@@ ins , and where farm@@ ers had pre@@ vi@@ ously produ@@ ced sur@@ p@@ lu@@ s gra@@ in , farm@@ ers had decided to with@@ dra@@ w from the fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er market , not use fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er and actually had dro@@ pped their use of fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er by 2@@ 7 percent ."
"This is a tra@@ gi@@ c example of ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed develo@@ pment , or a bud@@ ding green re@@ v@@ olution stop@@ ped in its trac@@ ks ."
"And this is not just speci@@ fic to E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , but happens over and over , all over Africa ."
"Well , I &apos;m not here today to l@@ am@@ ent about the situ@@ ation , or w@@ ring my h@@ ands ."
I am here to tell you that change is in the air .
"A@@ f@@ ri@@ ca today is not the Africa wai@@ ting for a@@ id solu@@ tions , or co@@ o@@ kie@@ -@@ cu@@ t@@ ter fore@@ ig@@ n exper@@ t poli@@ cy pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tions ."
"A@@ f@@ ri@@ ca has learned , or is lear@@ ning some@@ what s@@ low@@ ly , that marke@@ ts don &apos;t happen by themselves ."
"In the 19@@ 8@@ 0s , it was very fas@@ hi@@ on@@ able to talk about getting pri@@ ces right ."
"There was a very in@@ flu@@ enti@@ al book about that , which was ma@@ in@@ ly about getting govern@@ ments out of the market ."
"We now re@@ cogni@@ ze that getting marke@@ ts right is about not just pri@@ ce in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves , but also inv@@ est@@ ing in the right in@@ fra@@ structure and the appro@@ pri@@ ate and ne@@ cess@@ ary institu@@ tions to create the con@@ di@@ tions to un@@ le@@ as@@ h the power of in@@ no@@ vation in the market ."
"When con@@ di@@ tions are right , we know and see that that in@@ no@@ vation is ready to ex@@ plo@@ de in ru@@ ral Africa , just like any@@ where else ."
"N@@ early three years ago , I decided to leave my comfor@@ table job as a World B@@ ank s@@ eni@@ or econ@@ omi@@ st in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton and come back to my country of bir@@ th , E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , after ne@@ ar@@ ly 30 years ab@@ ro@@ ad ."
I did so for a simple reason .
"A@@ f@@ ter having spent more than a dec@@ ade under@@ standing , stu@@ dy@@ ing , and trying to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce poli@@ cy@@ mak@@ ers and d@@ on@@ ors about what was wrong with Africa &apos;s agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral marke@@ ts , I decided it was time to do something about it ."
"I cur@@ r@@ ently le@@ ad , in E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , an exci@@ ting new ini@@ ti@@ ative to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh the first E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia C@@ om@@ mo@@ di@@ ty E@@ x@@ change , or E@@ C@@ X ."
"Now , the com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty ex@@ change itself , that con@@ cept , is not new to the world ."
"In fact , in 1@@ 8@@ 4@@ 8 , 8@@ 2 gra@@ in mer@@ ch@@ an@@ ts and farm@@ ers got together in a small tow@@ n at the cro@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ads of the I@@ l@@ lin@@ o@@ is Ri@@ ver and L@@ ake Mi@@ chi@@ g@@ an to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh a way to tra@@ de better am@@ on@@ g@@ st themselves ."
"That was , of course , the bir@@ th of the Chi@@ ca@@ go Bo@@ ard of T@@ ra@@ de , which is the most fam@@ ous com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty ex@@ change in the world ."
The Chi@@ ca@@ go Bo@@ ard of T@@ ra@@ de was est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed then for pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly the same reas@@ ons that our farm@@ ers today would b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from a com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty ex@@ change .
"In the American Mi@@ dw@@ est , farm@@ ers used to lo@@ ad gra@@ in on@@ to bar@@ ges and sen@@ d it u@@ pri@@ ver to the Chi@@ ca@@ go market ."
"But once it ar@@ ri@@ ved , if no bu@@ y@@ er was to be found , or if pri@@ ces sud@@ den@@ ly dro@@ pped , farm@@ ers would in@@ cu@@ r tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous lo@@ s@@ ses ."
"And in fact , would even du@@ m@@ p the gra@@ in in L@@ ake Mi@@ chi@@ g@@ an , rather than spend more money transpor@@ ting it back to their far@@ ms ."
"Well , the need to av@@ o@@ id these huge ri@@ sk@@ s and tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous lo@@ s@@ ses led to the bir@@ th of the fu@@ tu@@ res market , and the under@@ l@@ ying system of gra@@ ding gra@@ in and re@@ cei@@ p@@ ting — issu@@ ing war@@ e@@ house re@@ cei@@ p@@ ts on the basi@@ s of which tra@@ de could be done ."
"F@@ ro@@ m there , the gre@@ at@@ est in@@ no@@ vation of all came about in this market , which is that bu@@ y@@ ers and sel@@ l@@ ers could trans@@ act gra@@ in without actually having to physi@@ cally or vi@@ su@@ ally in@@ spe@@ ct the gra@@ in ."
"That me@@ ant that gra@@ in could be tra@@ ded across tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous di@@ stan@@ ces , and even across time — as far forward as 18 months into the future ."
"This in@@ no@@ vation is at the heart of the trans@@ form@@ ation of American agri@@ culture , and the ri@@ se of Chi@@ ca@@ go to a global market , agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral market , super@@ power from where it was , a small regi@@ onal tow@@ n ."
"Now , over the last century , we ten@@ d to think of com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty ex@@ chang@@ es as the pur@@ view of W@@ est@@ er@@ n indu@@ stri@@ aliz@@ ed countries , and that the re@@ fer@@ ence pri@@ ces for c@@ ot@@ ton , co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , co@@ co@@ a — produ@@ cts produ@@ ced ma@@ in@@ ly in the s@@ outh — are actually a re@@ fer@@ ence pri@@ ce , or a pri@@ ce disco@@ vered in these organiz@@ ed com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty ex@@ chang@@ es in the nor@@ ther@@ n countries ."
But that is actually chang@@ ing .
And we &apos;re seeing a shi@@ ft — power@@ ed ma@@ in@@ ly because of information technology — a shi@@ ft in market dom@@ in@@ ance towar@@ ds the em@@ er@@ g@@ ing marke@@ ts .
"And over the last dec@@ ade , you see that the share of W@@ est@@ er@@ n ex@@ chang@@ es — and this is the U.@@ S. share of ex@@ chang@@ es in the world — has gone down by ne@@ ar@@ ly half in just the last dec@@ ade ."
"S@@ imi@@ lar@@ ly , there &apos;s been ex@@ plo@@ sive grow@@ th in Indi@@ a , for example , where ru@@ ral farm@@ ers are using ex@@ chang@@ es — grow@@ ing here over the last three years by 2@@ 70 percent a year ."
"This is power@@ ed by low@@ -@@ cost V@@ S@@ A@@ T technology , ag@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vely trying to re@@ ach farm@@ ers to bring them into the market ."
"Ch@@ ina &apos;s D@@ ali@@ an C@@ om@@ mo@@ di@@ ty E@@ x@@ change , three years ago , 200@@ 4 , over@@ took the Chi@@ ca@@ go Bo@@ ard of T@@ ra@@ de to become the second largest com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty ex@@ change in the world ."
"Now , in E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , we &apos;re in the process of desig@@ ning the first organiz@@ ed E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia C@@ om@@ mo@@ di@@ ty E@@ x@@ change ."
"We &apos;re not trying to cut and pa@@ ste the Chi@@ ca@@ go model or the Indi@@ a model , but cre@@ ating a system uni@@ qu@@ ely ta@@ ilo@@ red to E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia &apos;s needs and reali@@ ties , E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia &apos;s small farm@@ ers ."
"So , the E@@ C@@ X is an E@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ an ex@@ change for E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia ."
"We &apos;re cre@@ ating a system that ser@@ ves all market ac@@ t@@ ors , that cre@@ ates inte@@ g@@ ri@@ ty , tr@@ ust , ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy , tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy and en@@ ab@@ les small farm@@ ers to man@@ age the ri@@ sk@@ s that I have descri@@ bed ."
"In the design of our com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty ex@@ change in E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , we &apos;ve done something rather uni@@ qu@@ e , which is to take the appro@@ ach of an inte@@ gr@@ ated perspe@@ ctive , or what we call the E@@ C@@ X E@@ dge ."
The E@@ C@@ X E@@ dge pretty much cre@@ ates the entire e@@ co@@ system in which the market will develo@@ p itself .
And this is because one of the things we &apos;ve learned over the last dec@@ ade of stu@@ dy@@ ing market develo@@ pment in Africa is that the pie@@ ce@@ me@@ al appro@@ ach does not work .
"You &apos;ve got one d@@ on@@ or trying to develo@@ p market information , another trying to work on or spon@@ s@@ or gra@@ des and stan@@ dar@@ ds , another I@@ C@@ T , and yet another on war@@ e@@ h@@ ous@@ ing , or war@@ e@@ house re@@ cei@@ p@@ ts ."
"In our appro@@ ach in E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , we &apos;ve decided to put together the entire e@@ co@@ system , or environment , in which tra@@ de takes place ."
"That means that the ex@@ change will oper@@ ate a tra@@ ding system , which will ini@@ ti@@ ally start as an open out@@ c@@ ry , because we don &apos;t think the country &apos;s ready for full ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic tra@@ ding ."
"But at the same time , we &apos;ll do something which I think no ex@@ change in the world has ever done , which is itself to oper@@ ate something like an Inter@@ net ca@@ fe in the ru@@ ral are@@ as ."
"So that farm@@ ers and small tra@@ ders can actually come to a ter@@ min@@ al cen@@ ter — what we call the re@@ mot@@ e ac@@ cess ter@@ min@@ al cen@@ ters — and actually , without having to bu@@ y a computer or figure out how to di@@ al up or any of those things , simply see the tra@@ ding that &apos;s happening on the A@@ dd@@ is A@@ b@@ ab@@ a tra@@ ding flo@@ or ."
"A@@ t the same time , what &apos;s very fundam@@ ent@@ al to this market is that — and again , an in@@ no@@ vation that we &apos;ve desig@@ ned for our ex@@ change — is that the ex@@ change will oper@@ ate war@@ e@@ h@@ ous@@ es around the country , in which gra@@ de cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cation and war@@ e@@ house re@@ cei@@ p@@ ting will be done ."
"And in turn , we &apos;ll oper@@ ate an in@@ -@@ house c@@ lear@@ ing system , to as@@ sure that pa@@ y@@ ment is done appro@@ pri@@ ately , in the right amount and at the right time , so that basically , we create tr@@ ust and inte@@ g@@ ri@@ ty in the system ."
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , we work with ex@@ change ac@@ t@@ ors , and as we &apos;re develo@@ ping the ex@@ change market itself , we &apos;re also develo@@ ping the regu@@ lat@@ ory in@@ fra@@ structure and leg@@ al fra@@ me@@ work , the over@@ ar@@ ching leg@@ al fra@@ me@@ work for making this market work ."
"So , in fact , our pro@@ cl@@ am@@ ation is going to par@@ li@@ am@@ ent next mon@@ th ."
"What &apos;s really important is that the E@@ C@@ X will oper@@ ate a market information system to dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate pri@@ ces in real time to farm@@ ers around the country , using V@@ S@@ A@@ T technology to bring an ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic pri@@ ce dis@@ se@@ min@@ ation dire@@ ct@@ ly to farm@@ ers ."
"What this does is trans@@ form@@ s , fundam@@ ent@@ ally , the farm@@ ers &apos; relation@@ ship to the market ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as before the farm@@ er used to think local — me@@ an@@ ing that he or she would go to the ne@@ ar@@ est local market , eight to 10 kilome@@ ters away on a@@ ver@@ age , and se@@ ll whatever they happened to have , without any idea of what the pri@@ ce pre@@ mi@@ um or anything else was — now farm@@ ers come with know@@ le@@ dge of what pri@@ ces are at the national market ."
"And they start to think national , and even global ."
"They start to make not only comm@@ er@@ cial marke@@ ting deci@@ sions , but also plan@@ ting deci@@ sions , on the basi@@ s of information coming from the fu@@ tu@@ res pri@@ ce market ."
And they come to the market know@@ ing what gra@@ des their produ@@ cts will ach@@ ie@@ ve in terms of a pri@@ ce pre@@ mi@@ um .
So all of this will trans@@ form farm@@ ers .
It will also trans@@ form the way tra@@ ders do business .
"It will stop them from doing simple , back@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ back , li@@ mi@@ ted ar@@ bi@@ tra@@ ge to really thinking strate@@ gi@@ cally about how to move gra@@ in across long di@@ stan@@ ces from &#91; sur@@ p@@ lu@@ s regi@@ ons &#93; to &#91; de@@ fi@@ c@@ it are@@ as &#93; ."
C@@ an E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia do this ?
It seem@@ s very am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous .
But it will create new opportuni@@ ties .
"We believe that this ini@@ ti@@ ative requi@@ res great poli@@ tical will , and we &apos;ll have to ali@@ g@@ n the fin@@ an@@ cial se@@ ctor , as well as the I@@ C@@ T se@@ ctor , and really even the under@@ l@@ ying leg@@ al fra@@ me@@ work ."
"We believe that the win@@ ds of change are here , and that we can do it ."
"E@@ C@@ X is the market for E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia &apos;s new mi@@ l@@ len@@ ni@@ um , which star@@ ts in about eight months ."
The last par@@ li@@ am@@ ent of our century open@@ ed with our pre@@ si@@ dent an@@ n@@ oun@@ cing to the country that this was the most important economic ini@@ ti@@ ative for the country today .
"We believe that the st@@ ak@@ es are high , but that the re@@ turns will be even gre@@ ater ."
"E@@ C@@ X , mo@@ re@@ over , can become a tra@@ ding pl@@ at@@ form for a pan@@ -@@ Afri@@ can market in agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral com@@ mo@@ di@@ ties ."
E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia &apos;s dom@@ esti@@ c market is about one billion dollars of val@@ ue .
"And we feel that over the next five years , if E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia can cap@@ ture even 40 percent , just 40 percent , of the dom@@ esti@@ c market , and ad@@ d just 25 percent val@@ ue to that market , the val@@ ue of the market d@@ ou@@ b@@ les ."
"E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia &apos;s agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral market is 30 percent high@@ er than S@@ outh Africa &apos;s gra@@ in produ@@ ction , and , in fact , E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia is the second largest ma@@ i@@ ze produ@@ cer in Africa ."
So the poten@@ tial is there .
The will is there .
The com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment is there .
"So we feel that we have a win@@ ning val@@ ue pro@@ posi@@ tion to trans@@ form farm@@ ers &apos; cho@@ i@@ ces , to gro@@ w our agri@@ culture , and to change Africa ."
"So , we are in the business of fin@@ ding our happ@@ iness ."
Thank you very much .

"So , when I was in art school , I develo@@ ped a sha@@ ke in my hand , and this was the stra@@ igh@@ test line I could dra@@ w ."
"Now in h@@ in@@ d@@ si@@ ght , it was actually good for some things , like mi@@ x@@ ing a can of pa@@ int or sha@@ king a P@@ ol@@ aro@@ id , but at the time this was really do@@ om@@ s@@ day ."
This was the de@@ stru@@ ction of my dre@@ am of be@@ coming an arti@@ st .

"So to comp@@ en@@ s@@ ate , I &apos;d h@@ old the p@@ en ti@@ gh@@ ter , and this pro@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vely made the sha@@ ke wor@@ se , so I &apos;d h@@ old the p@@ en ti@@ gh@@ ter still ."
"And this became a vi@@ ci@@ ous cy@@ cle that en@@ ded up ca@@ using so much pa@@ in and jo@@ int issu@@ es , I had t@@ rou@@ ble hol@@ ding anything ."
"And after sp@@ ending all my life wan@@ ting to do art , I left art school , and then I left art completely ."
"But after a few years , I just couldn &apos;t st@@ ay away from art , and I decided to go to a neuro@@ logi@@ st about the sha@@ ke and disco@@ vered I had per@@ man@@ ent ner@@ ve dam@@ age ."
"And he actually took one look at my s@@ qui@@ gg@@ ly line , and said , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just em@@ brac@@ e the sha@@ ke ? &quot; &quot; So I did . I went home , I gra@@ b@@ bed a pen@@ ci@@ l , and I just started le@@ tting my hand sha@@ ke and sha@@ ke ."
I was making all these sc@@ ri@@ b@@ ble pi@@ ctures .
"And even though it wasn &apos;t the kind of art that I was ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate about , it felt great ."
"And more import@@ an@@ tly , once I em@@ brac@@ ed the sha@@ ke , I realized I could still make art ."
I just had to find a different appro@@ ach to making the art that I wanted .
"Now , I still en@@ jo@@ yed the fra@@ g@@ ment@@ ation of poin@@ ti@@ lli@@ sm , seeing these little t@@ iny d@@ ots come together to make this uni@@ f@@ ied whole ."
"So I began experim@@ ent@@ ing with other ways to fra@@ g@@ ment images where the sha@@ ke wouldn &apos;t af@@ fe@@ ct the work , like di@@ pping my fe@@ et in pa@@ int and wal@@ king on a can@@ v@@ as , or , in a 3@@ D structure consi@@ st@@ ing of two@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ f@@ ours , cre@@ ating a 2@@ D image by bur@@ ning it with a b@@ low@@ tor@@ ch ."
"I disco@@ vered that , if I worked on a lar@@ ger scale and with bi@@ g@@ ger materi@@ als , my hand really wouldn &apos;t h@@ ur@@ t , and after having gone from a single appro@@ ach to art , I en@@ ded up having an appro@@ ach to cre@@ ati@@ vity that completely changed my arti@@ stic h@@ ori@@ z@@ ons ."
This was the first time I &apos;d en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed this idea that em@@ brac@@ ing a li@@ mi@@ tation could actually dri@@ ve cre@@ ati@@ vity .
"A@@ t the time , I was fini@@ sh@@ ing up school , and I was so exci@@ ted to get a real job and finally af@@ for@@ d new art sup@@ pl@@ ies ."
"I had this hor@@ ri@@ ble little set of to@@ ols , and I felt like I could do so much more with the sup@@ pl@@ ies I thought an arti@@ st was sup@@ posed to have ."
I actually didn &apos;t even have a regu@@ lar pa@@ ir of s@@ ci@@ s@@ sor@@ s .
I was using these me@@ tal sh@@ ear@@ s until I sto@@ le a pa@@ ir from the offi@@ ce that I worked at .
"So I got out of school , I got a job , I got a pa@@ y@@ che@@ ck , I got myself to the art stor@@ e , and I just went nu@@ ts bu@@ ying sup@@ pl@@ ies ."
"And then when I got home , I s@@ at down and I set myself to t@@ ask to really try to create something just completely outside of the box ."
"But I s@@ at there for hours , and nothing came to mind ."
"The same thing the next day , and then the next , quickly sli@@ pping into a cre@@ ative s@@ lu@@ m@@ p ."
"And I was in a dar@@ k place for a long time , u@@ na@@ ble to create ."
"And it didn &apos;t make any sense , because I was finally able to sup@@ port my art , and yet I was cre@@ ati@@ vely bl@@ ank ."
"But as I sear@@ ched around in the dar@@ k@@ ness , I realized I was actually par@@ al@@ y@@ zed by all of the cho@@ i@@ ces that I never had before ."
And it was then that I thought back to my j@@ it@@ tery h@@ ands .
E@@ m@@ brac@@ e the sha@@ ke .
"And I realized , if I ever wanted my cre@@ ati@@ vity back , I had to qu@@ it trying so hard to think outside of the box and get back into it ."
"I wonder@@ ed , could you become more cre@@ ative , then , by looking for li@@ mi@@ t@@ ations ?"
What if I could only create with a dol@@ lar &apos;s wor@@ th of sup@@ pl@@ ies ?
"A@@ t this point , I was sp@@ ending a lot of my ev@@ en@@ ings in — well , I gu@@ ess I still spend a lot of my ev@@ en@@ ings in St@@ ar@@ bu@@ cks — but I know you can ask for an ex@@ tra cu@@ p if you want one , so I decided to ask for 50 ."
"S@@ ur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly , they just h@@ an@@ ded them right over , and then with some pen@@ ci@@ ls I already had , I made this project for only 80 c@@ ents ."
It really became a moment of c@@ lar@@ i@@ fi@@ cation for me that we need to first be li@@ mi@@ ted in order to become li@@ mi@@ t@@ less .
"I took this appro@@ ach of thinking inside the box to my can@@ v@@ as , and wonder@@ ed what if , instead of pain@@ ting on a can@@ v@@ as , I could only pa@@ int on my ch@@ est ?"

"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) O@@ r , what if instead of rel@@ ying on myself , I had to re@@ ly on other people to create the cont@@ ent for the art ?"

"( Applause ) O@@ r what if instead of making art to disp@@ l@@ ay , I had to de@@ stro@@ y it ?"
"This seem@@ ed like the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate li@@ mi@@ tation , being an arti@@ st without art ."
"This de@@ stru@@ ction idea turned into a year@@ long project that I called Go@@ od@@ by@@ e Ar@@ t , where each and every piece of art had to be de@@ stro@@ yed after its cre@@ ation ."
"In the beginning of Go@@ od@@ by@@ e Ar@@ t , I fo@@ c@@ used on for@@ ced de@@ stru@@ ction , like this image of J@@ i@@ mi H@@ en@@ dri@@ x , made with over 7@@ ,000 mat@@ ch@@ es ."
( Laughter ) Th@@ en I open@@ ed it up to cre@@ ating art that was de@@ stro@@ yed natur@@ ally .
"I looked for tem@@ por@@ ary materi@@ als , like spit@@ ting out food — ( Laughter ) — si@@ de@@ walk chal@@ k and even f@@ roz@@ en w@@ ine ."
The last i@@ ter@@ ation of de@@ stru@@ ction was to try to produ@@ ce something that didn &apos;t actually exi@@ st in the first place .
"So I organiz@@ ed c@@ and@@ les on a table , I li@@ t them , and then b@@ le@@ w them out , then re@@ pe@@ ated this process over and over with the same set of c@@ and@@ les , then as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ led the vi@@ de@@ os into the lar@@ ger image ."
So the end image was never visi@@ ble as a physi@@ cal whole .
It was de@@ stro@@ yed before it ever ex@@ ist@@ ed .
"In the course of this Go@@ od@@ by@@ e Ar@@ t ser@@ ies , I created 2@@ 3 different pie@@ ces with nothing left to physi@@ cally disp@@ l@@ ay ."
"What I thought would be the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate li@@ mi@@ tation actually turned out to be the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate li@@ ber@@ ation , as each time I created , the de@@ stru@@ ction brought me back to a neu@@ tra@@ l place where I felt re@@ fre@@ shed and ready to start the next project ."
It did not happen over@@ night .
"There were times when my proje@@ cts fai@@ led to get off the ground , or , even wor@@ se , after sp@@ ending t@@ ons of time on them the end image was kind of em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing ."
"But having com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted to the process , I contin@@ u@@ ed on , and something really sur@@ pri@@ sing came out of this ."
"As I de@@ stro@@ yed each project , I was lear@@ ning to let go , let go of out@@ comes , let go of fai@@ lu@@ res , and let go of im@@ perfe@@ ctions ."
"And in re@@ turn , I found a process of cre@@ ating art that &apos;s per@@ pe@@ tu@@ al and un@@ en@@ cu@@ m@@ ber@@ ed by resul@@ ts ."
"I found myself in a state of con@@ st@@ ant cre@@ ation , thinking only of what &apos;s next and coming up with more ideas than ever ."
"When I think back to my three years away from art , away from my dre@@ am , just going through the moti@@ ons , instead of trying to find a different way to contin@@ ue that dre@@ am , I just qu@@ it , I gave up ."
And what if I didn &apos;t em@@ brac@@ e the sha@@ ke ?
Because em@@ brac@@ ing the sha@@ ke for me wasn &apos;t just about art and having art sk@@ il@@ ls .
"It turned out to be about life , and having life sk@@ il@@ ls ."
"Because ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , most of what we do takes place here , inside the box , with li@@ mi@@ ted re@@ sources ."
"L@@ ear@@ ning to be cre@@ ative within the con@@ fin@@ es of our li@@ mi@@ t@@ ations is the best hope we have to trans@@ form ourselves and , colle@@ cti@@ vely , trans@@ form our world ."
L@@ o@@ o@@ king at li@@ mi@@ t@@ ations as a source of cre@@ ati@@ vity changed the course of my life .
"Now , when I run into a bar@@ r@@ ier or I find myself cre@@ ati@@ vely st@@ um@@ ped , I sometimes still stru@@ gg@@ le , but I contin@@ ue to show up for the process and try to re@@ mind myself of the possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies , like using hundre@@ ds of real , live wor@@ ms to make an image , using a p@@ us@@ h@@ p@@ in to tat@@ too a ban@@ ana , or pain@@ ting a picture with ha@@ m@@ bur@@ ger gre@@ ase ."
( Laughter ) One of my most re@@ cent en@@ de@@ av@@ ors is to try to trans@@ l@@ ate the ha@@ bi@@ ts of cre@@ ati@@ vity that I &apos;ve learned into something others can re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate .
"L@@ imi@@ t@@ ations may be the most un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly of places to har@@ ness cre@@ ati@@ vity , but per@@ haps one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ru@@ ts , re@@ think c@@ ate@@ gor@@ ies and challen@@ ge ac@@ cep@@ ted nor@@ ms ."
"And instead of tel@@ ling each other to se@@ i@@ ze the day , maybe we can re@@ mind ourselves every day to se@@ i@@ ze the li@@ mi@@ tation ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"I mean one of the bo@@ ys has a bot@@ tle of li@@ qu@@ or in his hand , he &apos;s 14 years old and it &apos;s a school day ."
"O@@ ther people , when they see this picture , might see g@@ an@@ gs , th@@ u@@ gs , de@@ lin@@ qu@@ ents — cri@@ min@@ als ."
But I see it different .
So will you jo@@ in me in chang@@ ing the way we la@@ be@@ l young people from &quot; &quot; at@@ -@@ ri@@ sk &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; at@@ -@@ pro@@ mi@@ se ? &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) How do I know that these young people have the poten@@ tial and the pro@@ mi@@ se to change ?
I know this because I am one of them .
"We were on wel@@ f@@ are , sometimes hom@@ el@@ ess , many times hun@@ g@@ ry ."
"B@@ y the time I was 15 years old , I had been in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated in ju@@ v@@ y three times for three fel@@ on@@ ies ."
My best friend had already been kil@@ led .
"And so@@ on after , while I &apos;m standing next to my un@@ cle , he gets sh@@ ot ."
And as I &apos;m wai@@ ting for the am@@ bu@@ l@@ ance to ar@@ ri@@ ve for over an hour ...
he b@@ le@@ eds to death on the stre@@ et .
"I had lost fai@@ th and hope in the world , and I had given up on the system because the system had fai@@ led me ."
I had nothing to of@@ f@@ er and no one had anything to of@@ f@@ er me .
I was f@@ at@@ ali@@ stic .
I didn &apos;t even think I could make it to my 1@@ 8@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
The reason I &apos;m here today is because a teach@@ er that car@@ ed re@@ ach@@ ed out and man@@ aged to ta@@ p into my s@@ ou@@ l .
"This teach@@ er , M@@ s. R@@ us@@ s ..."
she was the kind of teach@@ er that was always in your business .
"( Laughter ) She was the kind of teach@@ er that was like , &quot; V@@ i@@ ctor , I &apos;m here for you wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re ready . &quot; ( Laughter )"
I wasn &apos;t ready .
But she under@@ sto@@ od one basi@@ c prin@@ ci@@ ple about young people like me .
We &apos;re like o@@ yst@@ ers .
"We &apos;re only going to open up when we &apos;re ready , and if you &apos;re not there when we &apos;re ready , we &apos;re going to cl@@ am back up ."
M@@ s. R@@ us@@ s was there for me .
"S@@ he was cul@@ tur@@ ally rele@@ v@@ ant , she re@@ spe@@ cted my community , my people , my family ."
I told her a story about my U@@ n@@ cle R@@ u@@ be@@ n .
"He would take me to work with him because I was bro@@ ke , and he knew I needed some money ."
He colle@@ cted gl@@ as@@ s bot@@ t@@ les for a living .
"F@@ our in the morning on a school day , we &apos;d th@@ row the gl@@ as@@ s bot@@ t@@ les in the back of his v@@ an , and the bot@@ t@@ les would bre@@ ak ."
And my h@@ ands and ar@@ ms would start to b@@ le@@ ed and my ten@@ n@@ is sho@@ es and pan@@ ts would get all blo@@ ody .
"And I was terri@@ f@@ ied and in pa@@ in , and I would stop working ."
"And my un@@ cle , he would look me in the eyes and he would say to me , &quot; &quot; Mi@@ j@@ o , est@@ a@@ mo@@ s bus@@ can@@ do vi@@ da . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We &apos;re sear@@ ching for a better life , we &apos;re trying to make something out of nothing . &quot; &quot; M@@ s. R@@ us@@ s list@@ en@@ ed to my story , wel@@ com@@ ed it into the clas@@ s@@ room and said , &quot; &quot; V@@ i@@ ctor , this is your power ."
This is your poten@@ tial .
"@@ Y@@ our family , your culture , your community have t@@ au@@ ght you a har@@ d-@@ work e@@ th@@ ic and you will use it to em@@ power yourself in the ac@@ a@@ demi@@ c world so you can come back and em@@ power your community . &quot; &quot; Wi@@ th M@@ s. R@@ us@@ s &apos;s help , I en@@ ded up re@@ tur@@ ning to school ."
I even fini@@ shed my cre@@ di@@ ts on time and gra@@ du@@ ated with my clas@@ s .
"( Applause ) But M@@ s. R@@ us@@ s said to me right before gra@@ du@@ ation , &quot; &quot; V@@ i@@ ctor , I &apos;m so pro@@ u@@ d of you ."
I knew you could do it .
"Now it &apos;s time to go to colle@@ ge . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Col@@ le@@ ge , me ?"
"M@@ an , what is this teach@@ er smo@@ king thinking I &apos;m going to colle@@ ge ?"
"I ap@@ pl@@ ied with the ment@@ ors and sup@@ port she provi@@ ded , got a let@@ ter of ac@@ cep@@ t@@ ance , and one of the par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s read , &quot; You &apos;ve been ad@@ mi@@ t@@ ted under prob@@ ati@@ on@@ ary stat@@ us . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ rob@@ ation ? I &apos;m already on prob@@ ation , that don &apos;t matter ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It was ac@@ a@@ demi@@ c prob@@ ation , not cri@@ min@@ al prob@@ ation ."
But what do teach@@ ers like M@@ s. R@@ us@@ s do to suc@@ ce@@ ed with young people like the ones I study ?
I pro@@ pos@@ e three strate@@ g@@ ies .
The first : let &apos;s get ri@@ d of our de@@ fi@@ c@@ it perspe@@ ctive in education .
"&quot; &quot; These people come from a culture of violence , a culture of po@@ ver@@ ty ."
These people are at@@ -@@ ri@@ sk ; these people are tru@@ ant .
These people are em@@ p@@ ty con@@ tain@@ ers for us to fi@@ ll with know@@ le@@ dge .
"They have the problems , we have the solu@@ tions . &quot; &quot; N@@ um@@ ber two ."
Let &apos;s val@@ ue the stories that young people bring to the scho@@ ol@@ house .
Th@@ e@@ ir stories of over@@ coming in@@ sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table od@@ ds are so powerful .
And I know you know some of these stories .
"These very same stories and exper@@ ien@@ ces already have gr@@ it , char@@ ac@@ ter and re@@ sil@@ ience in them ."
So let &apos;s help young people ref@@ ine those stories .
And of course the third strate@@ gy being the most important : re@@ sources .
We have to provi@@ de a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate re@@ sources to young people .
G@@ r@@ it alone isn &apos;t going to cut it .
"You can si@@ t there and tell me all you want , &quot; H@@ ey man , pi@@ ck yourself up by the bo@@ ot@@ stra@@ ps . &quot;"
But if I was born without any stra@@ ps on my bo@@ ots — ( Laughter ) How am I sup@@ posed to pi@@ ck myself up ?
"( Applause ) Jo@@ b tra@@ ining , ment@@ or@@ ing , coun@@ sel@@ ing ..."
"T@@ e@@ ach@@ ing young people to learn from their mist@@ ak@@ es instead of cri@@ min@@ aliz@@ ing them , and dra@@ gg@@ ing them out of their clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms like animals ."
How about this ?
I pro@@ pos@@ e that we im@@ ple@@ ment re@@ stor@@ ative ju@@ sti@@ ce in every high school in America .
( Applause ) So we went out to test these ideas in the community of W@@ at@@ ts in L@@ A with 40 young people that had been p@@ us@@ h@@ ed out of school .
W@@ il@@ li@@ am was one of them .
W@@ il@@ li@@ am was the kind of kid that had been given every la@@ be@@ l .
"He had dro@@ pped out , he was a g@@ an@@ g member , a cri@@ min@@ al ."
And when we met him he was very resi@@ st@@ ant .
But I remember what M@@ s. R@@ us@@ s used to say .
"&quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m here for you wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re ready . &quot;"
( Laughter ) So over time — over time he began to open up .
And I remember the day that he made the s@@ wit@@ ch .
We were in a large group and a young l@@ ady in our program was c@@ ry@@ ing because she told us her powerful story of her d@@ ad being kil@@ led and then his body being sh@@ own in the ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er the next day .
"And as she &apos;s c@@ ry@@ ing , I don &apos;t know what to do , so I give her her space , and W@@ il@@ li@@ am had enough ."
"He sl@@ am@@ med his h@@ ands on the des@@ k and he said , &quot; H@@ ey , everybody ! G@@ rou@@ p hu@@ g ! G@@ rou@@ p hu@@ g ! &quot;"
"( Applause ) This young l@@ ady &apos;s te@@ ars and pa@@ in turned into jo@@ y and l@@ aughter know@@ ing that her community had her back , and W@@ il@@ li@@ am had now learned that he did have a pur@@ pos@@ e in life : to help to he@@ al the s@@ ou@@ ls of people in his own community ."
He told us his story .
We re@@ fin@@ ed his story to go from being the story of a vi@@ cti@@ m to being the story of a survi@@ v@@ or that has over@@ come ad@@ versity .
We plac@@ ed high val@@ ue on it .
"W@@ il@@ li@@ am went on to fin@@ is@@ h high school , get his secu@@ ri@@ ty gu@@ ard cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate to become a secu@@ ri@@ ty gu@@ ard , and is now working at a local school di@@ stri@@ ct ."
"( Applause ) M@@ s. R@@ us@@ s &apos;s man@@ tra — her man@@ tra was always , &quot; when you te@@ ach to the heart , the mind will fol@@ low . &quot;"
"The great wri@@ ter K@@ h@@ ali@@ l G@@ i@@ bra@@ n says , &quot; &quot; O@@ u@@ t of su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing have em@@ er@@ g@@ ed the gre@@ at@@ est s@@ ou@@ ls ."
"The mas@@ sive char@@ ac@@ ters are sear@@ ed with sc@@ ars . &quot; &quot; I believe that in this education re@@ v@@ olution that we &apos;re talking about we need to in@@ vi@@ te the s@@ ou@@ ls of the young people that we work with , and once they &apos;re able to ref@@ ine — iden@@ ti@@ fy their gr@@ it , re@@ sil@@ ience and char@@ ac@@ ter that they &apos;ve already develo@@ ped — their ac@@ a@@ demi@@ c perform@@ ance will impro@@ ve ."
Let &apos;s believe in young people .
Let &apos;s provi@@ de them the right kinds of re@@ sources .
I &apos;ll tell you what my teach@@ er did for me .
She belie@@ ved in me so much that she tri@@ cked me into belie@@ ving in myself .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So today &apos;s top che@@ f clas@@ s is in how to ro@@ b a b@@ ank , and it &apos;s clear that the gener@@ al public needs gu@@ i@@ dance , because the a@@ ver@@ age b@@ ank rob@@ ber@@ y ne@@ ts only 7@@ ,@@ 500 dollars ."
R@@ ank am@@ ate@@ ur@@ s who know nothing about how to co@@ ok the boo@@ ks .
"The fol@@ ks who know , of course , run our largest ban@@ ks , and in the last go@@ -@@ around , they cost us over 11 tri@@ llion dollars ."
That &apos;s what 11 tri@@ llion looks like .
That &apos;s how many zer@@ os ?
And cost us over 10 million j@@ ob@@ s as well .
"So our t@@ ask is to edu@@ cate ourselves so that we can understand why we have these re@@ cur@@ r@@ ent , inten@@ si@@ f@@ ying fin@@ an@@ cial cri@@ ses , and how we can pre@@ v@@ ent them in the future ."
And the answer to that is that we have to stop epi@@ demi@@ cs of control fra@@ u@@ d .
"C@@ on@@ tro@@ l fra@@ u@@ d is what happens when the people who control , ty@@ pi@@ cally a C@@ E@@ O , a seem@@ ing@@ ly le@@ gi@@ ti@@ m@@ ate enti@@ ty , use it as a we@@ apo@@ n to de@@ fra@@ u@@ d ."
And these are the we@@ apo@@ ns of mas@@ s de@@ stru@@ ction in the fin@@ an@@ cial world .
"They also fol@@ low in fin@@ ance a particular strate@@ gy , because the we@@ apo@@ n of cho@@ ice in fin@@ ance is ac@@ coun@@ ting , and there is a re@@ ci@@ pe for ac@@ coun@@ ting control fra@@ u@@ d , and how it oc@@ cur@@ s ."
And we disco@@ vered this re@@ ci@@ pe in quite an od@@ d way that I &apos;ll come back to in a moment .
"If you fol@@ low those four simple ste@@ ps , and any b@@ ank can fol@@ low them , then you are ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cally gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to have three things oc@@ cu@@ r ."
"The first thing is you will re@@ port recor@@ d b@@ ank pro@@ fi@@ ts — not just high , recor@@ d ."
"T@@ wo , the C@@ E@@ O will im@@ medi@@ ately be made incredi@@ bly we@@ al@@ th@@ y by moder@@ n ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tive comp@@ en@@ s@@ ation ."
"And three , far@@ ther down the ro@@ ad , the b@@ ank will su@@ f@@ f@@ er cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ hi@@ c lo@@ s@@ ses and will fa@@ il un@@ less it is ba@@ i@@ led out ."
"In other words , a co@@ ro@@ ner could find these things because this is a f@@ at@@ al re@@ ci@@ pe that will de@@ stro@@ y the ban@@ ks as well as the econom@@ y ."
"And three , the war@@ n@@ ings were u@@ na@@ m@@ bi@@ gu@@ ous ."
They were obvi@@ ous that what was going on was an epi@@ demi@@ c of ac@@ coun@@ ting control fra@@ u@@ d building up .
Let &apos;s take app@@ ra@@ is@@ al fra@@ u@@ d first .
"So this was an incredi@@ bly early war@@ ning , 2@@ 000 ."
"It was something we &apos;d seen before , and it was completely u@@ na@@ m@@ bi@@ gu@@ ous ."
This was an epi@@ demi@@ c of ac@@ coun@@ ting control fra@@ u@@ d led by the ban@@ ks .
What about li@@ ar &apos;s lo@@ ans ?
"Well , that war@@ ning actually comes ear@@ lie@@ r ."
"The sa@@ v@@ ings and lo@@ an de@@ bac@@ le is basically the early 19@@ 8@@ 0s through 199@@ 3 , and in the mi@@ d@@ st of fi@@ gh@@ ting that wa@@ ve of ac@@ coun@@ ting control fra@@ u@@ d , in 199@@ 0 , we found that a second front of fra@@ u@@ d was being started ."
"And like all good fin@@ an@@ cial fra@@ u@@ ds in America , it began in O@@ r@@ ange C@@ oun@@ ty , C@@ alifor@@ nia ."
And we happened to be the regi@@ onal regu@@ lat@@ ors for it .
"And our exam@@ in@@ ers said , they are making lo@@ ans without even che@@ c@@ king what the bor@@ row@@ er &apos;s in@@ come is ."
So we knew again about this cri@@ sis .
"We had incredi@@ bly early war@@ n@@ ings of it , and it was absolu@@ tely u@@ na@@ m@@ bi@@ gu@@ ous that no hon@@ est len@@ der would make lo@@ ans in this fas@@ hi@@ on ."
St@@ art with the indu@@ stry .
The indu@@ stry respon@@ ded between 200@@ 3 and 200@@ 6 by incre@@ as@@ ing li@@ ar &apos;s lo@@ ans by over 500 percent .
These were the lo@@ ans that hy@@ per@@ in@@ f@@ lated the bu@@ b@@ ble and produ@@ ced the economic cri@@ sis .
"B@@ y 200@@ 6 , half of all the lo@@ ans called sub@@ pri@@ me were also li@@ ar &apos;s lo@@ ans ."
"They &apos;re not mu@@ tually ex@@ clu@@ sive , it &apos;s just that together , they &apos;re the most to@@ x@@ ic com@@ bin@@ ation you can possi@@ bly imagine ."
This came from the len@@ ders because of the fra@@ u@@ d re@@ ci@@ pe .
What happened to app@@ ra@@ is@@ al fra@@ u@@ d ?
It ex@@ pan@@ ded re@@ mark@@ ably as well .
"B@@ y 200@@ 7 , when a sur@@ v@@ ey of app@@ ra@@ is@@ ers was done , 90 percent of app@@ ra@@ is@@ ers re@@ por@@ ted that they had been sub@@ je@@ ct to co@@ er@@ ci@@ on from the len@@ ders trying to get them to in@@ fl@@ ate an app@@ ra@@ is@@ al ."
"In other words , both form@@ s of fra@@ u@@ d became absolu@@ tely en@@ demi@@ c and nor@@ mal , and this is what dro@@ ve the bu@@ b@@ ble ."
What happened in the govern@@ ment@@ al se@@ ctor ?
"Well , the government , as I told you , when we were the sa@@ v@@ ings and lo@@ an regu@@ lat@@ ors , we could only deal with our indu@@ stry , and if people gave up their fe@@ der@@ al de@@ pos@@ it in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce , we couldn &apos;t do anything to them ."
"C@@ on@@ gre@@ ss , it may stri@@ ke you as im@@ possible , but actually did something inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent in 199@@ 4 , and pas@@ sed the H@@ ome O@@ w@@ ner@@ ship and E@@ qui@@ ty Pro@@ te@@ ction A@@ ct that gave the F@@ ed , and only the F@@ e@@ der@@ al R@@ es@@ er@@ ve , the ex@@ p@@ lic@@ it , stat@@ ut@@ ory au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty to b@@ an li@@ ar &apos;s lo@@ ans by every len@@ der , whether or not they had fe@@ der@@ al de@@ pos@@ it in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce ."
"So what did B@@ en B@@ er@@ n@@ an@@ ke and Al@@ an Gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an , as cha@@ ir@@ s of the F@@ ed , do when they got these war@@ n@@ ings that these were mas@@ si@@ vely fra@@ u@@ du@@ l@@ ent lo@@ ans and that they were being s@@ old to the secon@@ d@@ ary market ?"
"R@@ e@@ member , there &apos;s no fra@@ u@@ d ex@@ or@@ ci@@ st ."
"So the fra@@ u@@ d is going to pro@@ gre@@ ss through the entire system , hy@@ per@@ in@@ fl@@ ate the bu@@ b@@ ble , produ@@ ce a disa@@ ster ."
"And remember , we had experience with this ."
"We had seen sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant lo@@ s@@ ses , and we had experience of compe@@ t@@ ent regu@@ lat@@ ors in stop@@ ping it ."
Gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an and B@@ er@@ n@@ an@@ ke ref@@ used to use the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty under the stat@@ u@@ te to stop li@@ ar &apos;s lo@@ ans .
And this was a matter first of do@@ g@@ ma .
They &apos;re just hor@@ ri@@ fi@@ cally op@@ posed to anything regu@@ lat@@ ory .
"But it is also the inter@@ national compe@@ ti@@ tion in la@@ x@@ ity , the rac@@ e to the bot@@ tom between the United States and the United K@@ ing@@ dom , the city of Lon@@ don , in particular , and the city of Lon@@ don won that rac@@ e to the bot@@ tom , but it me@@ ant that all regu@@ l@@ ation in the W@@ est was completely de@@ gra@@ ded in this stu@@ pi@@ d compe@@ ti@@ tion to be who could have the we@@ ak@@ est regu@@ l@@ ation ."
So that was the regu@@ lat@@ ory respon@@ se .
"What about the respon@@ se of the pro@@ secu@@ t@@ ors after the cri@@ sis , after 11 tri@@ llion dollars in lo@@ s@@ ses , after 10 million j@@ ob@@ s lost , a cri@@ sis in which the lo@@ s@@ ses and the fra@@ u@@ ds were more than 70 times lar@@ ger than the sa@@ v@@ ings and lo@@ an de@@ bac@@ le ?"
"Well , in the sa@@ v@@ ings and lo@@ an de@@ bac@@ le , our ag@@ en@@ cy that regu@@ lated sa@@ v@@ ings and lo@@ ans , O@@ T@@ S , made over 3@@ 0,000 cri@@ min@@ al re@@ fer@@ r@@ als , produ@@ ced over 1@@ ,000 fel@@ ony con@@ vi@@ ctions just in c@@ ases desig@@ nat@@ ed as major , and that under@@ st@@ ates the de@@ gre@@ e of pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ation , because we worked with the F@@ B@@ I to create the li@@ st of the top 100 fra@@ u@@ d sch@@ em@@ es , the absolu@@ te wor@@ st of the wor@@ st , n@@ ati@@ on@@ wi@@ de ."
V@@ ir@@ tually all of them were pro@@ secu@@ ted .
We had a 90 percent con@@ vi@@ ction r@@ ate .
"It &apos;s the gre@@ at@@ est suc@@ cess against e@@ li@@ te white col@@ lar cri@@ min@@ als ever , and it was because of this under@@ standing of control fra@@ u@@ d and the ac@@ coun@@ ting control fra@@ u@@ d mechani@@ sm ."
F@@ las@@ h forward to the cur@@ r@@ ent cri@@ sis .
"The O@@ f@@ fi@@ ce of the C@@ om@@ p@@ tro@@ l@@ ler of the C@@ ur@@ ren@@ cy , which is sup@@ posed to regu@@ l@@ ate the largest national ban@@ ks , has made zer@@ o cri@@ min@@ al re@@ fer@@ r@@ als ."
The F@@ ed ap@@ pe@@ ars to have made zer@@ o cri@@ min@@ al re@@ fer@@ r@@ als .
"It isn &apos;t simply that they &apos;ve had to re@@ inv@@ ent the whe@@ el of how to do these pro@@ secu@@ tions ; they &apos;ve for@@ got@@ ten that the whe@@ el ex@@ ist@@ s , and ther@@ e@@ fore , we have zer@@ o pro@@ secu@@ tions , and of course , zer@@ o con@@ vi@@ ctions , of any of the e@@ li@@ te b@@ ank fra@@ u@@ ds , the W@@ all St@@ re@@ et typ@@ es , that dro@@ ve this cri@@ sis ."
"Wi@@ th no exper@@ ti@@ se coming from the regu@@ lat@@ ors , the F@@ B@@ I form@@ ed what it cal@@ ls a part@@ ner@@ ship with the M@@ or@@ t@@ g@@ age B@@ an@@ k@@ ers A@@ s@@ so@@ ci@@ ation in 200@@ 7 ."
The M@@ or@@ t@@ g@@ age B@@ an@@ k@@ ers A@@ s@@ so@@ ci@@ ation is the tra@@ de as@@ so@@ ci@@ ation of the per@@ ps .
"And the M@@ or@@ t@@ g@@ age B@@ an@@ k@@ ers A@@ s@@ so@@ ci@@ ation set out , it had the aud@@ aci@@ ty and the suc@@ cess to c@@ on the F@@ B@@ I ."
"It had created a sup@@ posed defini@@ tion of mor@@ t@@ g@@ age fra@@ u@@ d , in which , gu@@ ess what , its mem@@ bers are always the vi@@ cti@@ m and never the per@@ pe@@ tr@@ at@@ ors ."
"And the F@@ B@@ I has b@@ ou@@ ght this ho@@ ok , line , sin@@ k@@ er , ro@@ d , re@@ el and the boat they ro@@ de out in ."
"And it &apos;s those o@@ h@@ -@@ so@@ -@@ cle@@ ver ha@@ ir@@ dre@@ s@@ s@@ ers who were able to de@@ fra@@ u@@ d the po@@ or , pi@@ ti@@ ful ban@@ ks , who l@@ ack any fin@@ an@@ cial s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ cation ."
"It is the sil@@ lie@@ st story you can con@@ cei@@ ve of , and so they go and they pro@@ secu@@ te the ha@@ ir@@ dre@@ s@@ s@@ ers , and they leave the ban@@ k@@ st@@ ers alone enti@@ re@@ ly ."
"And so , while li@@ ons are ro@@ am@@ ing the cam@@ p@@ site , the F@@ B@@ I is ch@@ as@@ ing mi@@ ce ."
What do we need to do ?
What can we do in all of this ?
We need to change the per@@ verse in@@ cen@@ tive stru@@ ctures that produ@@ ce these re@@ cur@@ r@@ ent epi@@ demi@@ cs of ac@@ coun@@ ting control fra@@ u@@ d that are dri@@ ving our cri@@ ses .
So we have to first get ri@@ d of the syst@@ e@@ mi@@ cally d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous institu@@ tions .
These are the so@@ -@@ called to@@ o@@ -@@ bi@@ g@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ fa@@ il institu@@ tions .
"We need to sh@@ r@@ in@@ k them to the point , within the next five years , that they no longer pos@@ e a syst@@ e@@ mi@@ c ri@@ sk ."
"R@@ ight now , they are ti@@ c@@ king time b@@ om@@ b@@ s that will cause a global cri@@ sis as so@@ on as the next one fa@@ il@@ s — not if , when ."
"S@@ econ@@ d thing we need to do is completely re@@ form moder@@ n ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tive and prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal comp@@ en@@ s@@ ation , which is what they use to su@@ born the app@@ ra@@ is@@ ers ."
"R@@ e@@ member , they were pres@@ sur@@ ing the app@@ ra@@ is@@ ers through the comp@@ en@@ s@@ ation system , trying to produ@@ ce what we call a Gre@@ sha@@ m &apos;s dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c , in which bad e@@ thi@@ cs dri@@ ves good e@@ thi@@ cs out of the marke@@ t@@ place ."
"And they lar@@ ge@@ ly suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed , which is how the fra@@ u@@ d became en@@ demi@@ c ."
That is not simply cri@@ tical to our econom@@ y .
You can see what these cri@@ ses do to in@@ equ@@ ality and what they do to our de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y .
There are many form@@ s of am@@ muni@@ tion they can use .
"That &apos;s why we need to learn what the ban@@ k@@ ers have learned : the re@@ ci@@ pe for the best way to ro@@ b a b@@ ank , so that we can stop that re@@ ci@@ pe , because our le@@ gi@@ s@@ lat@@ ors , who are depen@@ dent on poli@@ tical con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions , will not do it on their own ."

This is a ven@@ ding mach@@ ine in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les .
"It &apos;s in a sh@@ op@@ ping mall , and it sel@@ ls fish e@@ g@@ gs ."
It &apos;s a ca@@ vi@@ ar ven@@ ding mach@@ ine .
"This is the Ar@@ t-@@ o@@ -@@ m@@ at , an art ven@@ ding mach@@ ine that sel@@ ls small arti@@ stic cre@@ ations by different arti@@ sts , usu@@ ally on small wood blo@@ cks or mat@@ ch@@ bo@@ x@@ es , in li@@ mi@@ ted e@@ di@@ tion ."
"In fact , I saw O@@ li@@ ver do one of these st@@ raw@@ ber@@ ry DNA ex@@ trac@@ tions about a year ago , and this is what led me on@@ to this bi@@ zar@@ re pat@@ h that I &apos;m going to talk to you right now ."
"Because st@@ raw@@ ber@@ ry DNA is really fas@@ cin@@ ating , because it &apos;s so beautiful ."
"I &apos;d never thought about DNA being a beautiful thing before , before I saw it in this form ."
"And I started doing this on my own , and this is what my DNA actually looks like ."
"And I was at a din@@ ner par@@ ty with some friends , some arti@@ st friends , and I was tel@@ ling them about this project , and they couldn &apos;t believe that you could actually see DNA ."
"So I said , all right , let &apos;s get out some sup@@ pl@@ ies right now ."
You can kind of tell from their re@@ ac@@ tions .
And so I started doing this regu@@ lar@@ ly .
This is what that looked like .
And it started to make me think about a couple of things .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , this looked a lot like my F@@ ace@@ book w@@ all ."
"And the second thing was , one time a friend came over and looked at this on my table and was like , &quot; &quot; Oh ."
They were just num@@ ber@@ ed because that was the order that I ex@@ trac@@ ted the DNA in .
You bu@@ y these bo@@ x@@ es . You &apos;re not sure what &apos;s going to be inside of them .
"And so , of course , I decided to create an art in@@ stal@@ l@@ ation called the DNA V@@ ending M@@ ach@@ ine ."
Here it is .
And how much will these sam@@ ples be wor@@ th ?
And will you bu@@ y someone else &apos;s sam@@ ple ?
And what will you be able to do with that sam@@ ple ?
Thank you .

R@@ ight now is the most exci@@ ting time to see new Indi@@ an art .
Con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary arti@@ sts in Indi@@ a are having a convers@@ ation with the world like never before .
"I thought it might be interesting , even for the many lon@@ g@@ -@@ time colle@@ ct@@ ors here with us at TED , local colle@@ ct@@ ors , to have an outside view of 10 young Indi@@ an arti@@ sts I wi@@ sh everyone at TED to know ."
The first is B@@ har@@ t@@ i K@@ her .
"The cent@@ ral mot@@ if of B@@ har@@ t@@ i &apos;s prac@@ ti@@ ce is the re@@ ad@@ y@@ -@@ made sto@@ re@@ -@@ b@@ ou@@ ght bin@@ d@@ i that un@@ told mi@@ llions of Indi@@ an women app@@ ly to their fore@@ he@@ ads , every day , in an act clo@@ se@@ ly as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with the institu@@ tion of mar@@ ri@@ age ."
But ori@@ gin@@ ally the sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ance of the bin@@ d@@ i is to sym@@ bo@@ li@@ ze the third ey@@ e between the spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al world and the religi@@ ous world .
"B@@ har@@ t@@ i see@@ ks to li@@ ber@@ ate this every@@ day cli@@ ch@@ e , as she cal@@ ls it , by ex@@ plo@@ ding it into something spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar ."
"S@@ he also cre@@ ates li@@ fe@@ -@@ size fi@@ ber@@ gl@@ as@@ s s@@ cul@@ p@@ tu@@ res , often of animals , which she then completely co@@ ver@@ s in bin@@ d@@ is , often with pot@@ ent sym@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ."
"S@@ he says she first got started with 10 pac@@ ke@@ ts of bin@@ d@@ is , and then wonder@@ ed what she could do with 10 thous@@ and ."
"O@@ ur next arti@@ st , B@@ al@@ as@@ u@@ bra@@ m@@ ani@@ am , really stan@@ ds at the cro@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ads of s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture , pain@@ ting and in@@ stal@@ l@@ ation , working won@@ ders with fi@@ ber@@ gl@@ as@@ s ."
"S@@ in@@ ce B@@ ala hi@@ m@@ self will be spe@@ aking at TED I won &apos;t spend too much time on him here today , ex@@ cept to say that he really suc@@ ce@@ eds at making the in@@ visi@@ ble visi@@ ble ."
"B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n@@ -@@ based Chi@@ tra G@@ an@@ es@@ h is known for her di@@ gi@@ tal col@@ l@@ ages , using Indi@@ an com@@ ic boo@@ ks called am@@ ar chi@@ tra ka@@ th@@ as as her pri@@ mar@@ y source materi@@ al ."

"I , for one , was ste@@ e@@ ped in these ."
Chi@@ tra basically re@@ mi@@ x@@ es and re@@ -@@ ti@@ t@@ les these i@@ con@@ ic images to te@@ ase out some of the se@@ x@@ u@@ al and gen@@ der poli@@ ti@@ cs em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in these de@@ e@@ ply in@@ flu@@ enti@@ al com@@ i@@ cs .
And she uses this v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ lar@@ y in her in@@ stal@@ l@@ ation work as well .

"As you can see , he &apos;s he@@ avi@@ ly in@@ flu@@ en@@ ced by gra@@ f@@ fi@@ t@@ i and stre@@ et art , and his home city of M@@ um@@ ba@@ i is an e@@ ver@@ -@@ present ele@@ ment in his work ."
He really cap@@ tu@@ res that sense of den@@ sity and energy which really char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ z@@ es moder@@ n urb@@ an B@@ om@@ b@@ ay .
He also cre@@ ates ph@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ mag@@ or@@ ic s@@ cul@@ p@@ tu@@ res made of b@@ ones from c@@ ast resi@@ n .

"This next arti@@ st , N@@ .@@ S. H@@ ar@@ sh@@ a , actually has a studi@@ o right here in M@@ y@@ sor@@ e ."
He &apos;s pu@@ tting a con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary sp@@ in on the min@@ i@@ ature tra@@ di@@ tion .
"He cre@@ ates these f@@ ine , de@@ lic@@ ate images which he then re@@ pe@@ ats on a mas@@ sive scale ."
"He uses scale to more and more spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar effe@@ ct , whether on the ro@@ of of a tem@@ ple in S@@ ing@@ apo@@ re , or in his incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous in@@ stal@@ l@@ ation work , here with 19@@ 2 fun@@ cti@@ on@@ ing se@@ w@@ ing mach@@ ines , f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ating the fl@@ ag@@ s of every member of the United N@@ ations ."
M@@ um@@ ba@@ i@@ -@@ based D@@ h@@ ru@@ v@@ i A@@ char@@ ya buil@@ ds on her love of com@@ ic boo@@ ks and stre@@ et art to com@@ ment on the ro@@ les and expe@@ ct@@ ations of moder@@ n Indi@@ an women .
"S@@ he too min@@ es the ri@@ ch source materi@@ al of am@@ ar chi@@ tra ka@@ th@@ as , but in a very different way than Chi@@ tra G@@ an@@ es@@ h ."
"In this particular work , she actually stri@@ ps out the images and lea@@ ves the ac@@ tu@@ al te@@ xt to re@@ ve@@ al something pre@@ vi@@ ously un@@ seen , and pro@@ v@@ oc@@ ative ."
"R@@ a@@ q@@ i@@ b S@@ ha@@ w is K@@ ol@@ kat@@ a@@ -@@ born , K@@ ash@@ mi@@ r@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ed , and Lon@@ d@@ on-@@ tra@@ ined ."
He too is re@@ inv@@ ent@@ ing the min@@ i@@ ature tra@@ di@@ tion .
"He cre@@ ates these op@@ ul@@ ent tab@@ le@@ au@@ s inspi@@ red by H@@ ie@@ ron@@ y@@ mu@@ s B@@ os@@ ch , but also by the K@@ ash@@ mi@@ r@@ i te@@ x@@ ti@@ les of his y@@ outh ."
He actually ap@@ pl@@ ies me@@ tal@@ li@@ c indu@@ stri@@ al pain@@ ts to his work using por@@ cu@@ p@@ ine qu@@ il@@ ls to get this ri@@ ch de@@ ta@@ i@@ led effe@@ ct .
I &apos;m kind of che@@ ating with this next arti@@ st since R@@ a@@ q@@ s Me@@ di@@ a Col@@ le@@ ctive are really three arti@@ sts working together .
"R@@ a@@ q@@ s are probably the fore@@ most prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers of mul@@ ti@@ media art in Indi@@ a today , working across photograph@@ y , video and in@@ stal@@ l@@ ation ."
"They fre@@ qu@@ ently expl@@ ore the@@ mes of glob@@ aliz@@ ation and urb@@ ani@@ z@@ ation , and their home of D@@ el@@ h@@ i is a fre@@ qu@@ ent ele@@ ment in their work ."
"H@@ ere , they in@@ vi@@ te the vie@@ wer to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze a cri@@ me looking at evi@@ dence and clu@@ es em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in five nar@@ r@@ ati@@ ves on these five different scre@@ ens , in which the city itself may have been the cul@@ pr@@ it ."
"This next arti@@ st is probably the al@@ ph@@ a m@@ ale of con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary Indi@@ an art , Su@@ bod@@ h G@@ up@@ ta ."
"He was first known for cre@@ ating gi@@ ant ph@@ ot@@ o@@ -@@ reali@@ stic can@@ v@@ ases , pain@@ t@@ ings of every@@ day obje@@ cts , the sta@@ in@@ less ste@@ el k@@ it@@ ch@@ en v@@ es@@ sel@@ s and ti@@ f@@ f@@ in con@@ tain@@ ers known to every Indi@@ an ."
"He ce@@ le@@ br@@ ates these local and mu@@ n@@ dane obje@@ cts glob@@ ally , and on a gran@@ der and gran@@ der scale , by in@@ cor@@ por@@ ating them into ever more co@@ lo@@ s@@ s@@ al s@@ cul@@ p@@ tu@@ res and in@@ stal@@ l@@ ations ."
"And finally number 10 , last and cer@@ tain@@ ly not least , R@@ an@@ j@@ ani S@@ he@@ t@@ t@@ ar , who lives and works here in the state of K@@ ar@@ nat@@ ak@@ a , cre@@ ates e@@ ther@@ e@@ al s@@ cul@@ p@@ tu@@ res and in@@ stal@@ l@@ ations that really mar@@ ry the organi@@ c to the indu@@ stri@@ al , and br@@ ings , like Su@@ bod@@ h , the local global ."
These are actually wi@@ res w@@ ra@@ pped in mus@@ li@@ n and ste@@ e@@ ped in ve@@ ge@@ table dy@@ e .
"And she ar@@ r@@ ang@@ es them so that the vie@@ wer actually has to na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate through the space , and inter@@ act with the obje@@ cts ."
And light and sha@@ do@@ w are a very important part of her work .
"S@@ he also ex@@ plo@@ res the@@ mes of con@@ sum@@ eri@@ sm , and the environment , such as in this work , where these bas@@ ke@@ t-@@ like obje@@ cts look organi@@ c and wo@@ ven , and are wo@@ ven , but with the stri@@ ps of ste@@ el , s@@ al@@ v@@ aged from cars that she found in a B@@ ang@@ al@@ ore j@@ un@@ k@@ y@@ ard ."
"@@ 10 arti@@ sts , six minutes , I know that was a lot to take in ."
But I can only hope I &apos;ve wh@@ et your ap@@ pe@@ ti@@ te to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in Indi@@ a today .
Thank you very much for looking and list@@ ening .

"I &apos;m a neuro@@ scienti@@ st , a prof@@ ess@@ or at the Uni@@ versity of C@@ alifor@@ nia ."
"And over the past 3@@ 5 years , I &apos;ve stud@@ ied behavi@@ or on the basi@@ s of everything from gen@@ es through neuro@@ trans@@ mi@@ t@@ ters , dop@@ am@@ ine , things like that , all the way through cir@@ cu@@ it an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s ."
So that &apos;s what I nor@@ m@@ ally do .
"But then , for some reason , I got into something else , just re@@ cent@@ ly ."
And it all gre@@ w out of one of my colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es as@@ king me to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze a bu@@ n@@ ch of bra@@ ins of psy@@ ch@@ op@@ a@@ th@@ ic kil@@ l@@ ers .
And so this would be the ty@@ pi@@ cal talk I would give .
"And the question is , &quot; &quot; How do you end up with a psy@@ ch@@ op@@ a@@ th@@ ic kil@@ ler ? &quot; &quot; What I mean by psy@@ ch@@ op@@ a@@ th@@ ic kil@@ ler are these people , these typ@@ es of people ."
And so some of the bra@@ ins that I &apos;ve stud@@ ied are people you know about .
When I get the bra@@ ins I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m looking at .
It &apos;s bl@@ ind experim@@ ents . They also gave me nor@@ mal people and everything .
So I &apos;ve looked at about 70 of these .
And what came up was a number of pie@@ ces of data .
"So we look at these sor@@ ts of things the@@ ore@@ ti@@ cally , on the basi@@ s of gen@@ e@@ ti@@ cs , and brain dam@@ age , and inter@@ action with environment , and exactly how that mach@@ ine works ."
"So we &apos;re interested in exactly where in the brain , and what &apos;s the most important part of the brain ."
"So we &apos;ve been looking at this : the inter@@ action of gen@@ es , what &apos;s called epi@@ gen@@ e@@ tic effe@@ cts , brain dam@@ age , and environment , and how these are t@@ ied together ."
"And how you end up with a psy@@ ch@@ op@@ ath , and a kil@@ ler , depen@@ ds on exactly when the dam@@ age oc@@ cur@@ s ."
It &apos;s really a very pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly ti@@ med thing .
You get different kinds of psy@@ ch@@ op@@ a@@ ths .
"So we &apos;re going along with this . And here &apos;s , just to give you the pat@@ ter@@ n ."
"The pat@@ ter@@ n is that those people , every one of them I looked at , who was a mu@@ r@@ der@@ er , and was a seri@@ al kil@@ ler , had dam@@ age to their or@@ bi@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x , which is right ab@@ o@@ ve the eyes , the or@@ bi@@ ts , and also the inter@@ i@@ or part of the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be ."
"So there is the pat@@ ter@@ n that every one of them had , but they all were a little different too ."
They had other sor@@ ts of brain dam@@ age .
"A key thing is that the major violence gen@@ es , it &apos;s called the M@@ A@@ O@@ -@@ A gen@@ e ."
And there is a v@@ ari@@ ant of this gen@@ e that is in the nor@@ mal popul@@ ation .
S@@ ome of you have this . And it &apos;s se@@ x@@ -@@ lin@@ ked .
It &apos;s on the X chro@@ mo@@ some . And so in this way you can only get it from your mother .
"And in fact this is probably why mo@@ st@@ ly men , bo@@ ys , are psy@@ ch@@ op@@ a@@ th@@ ic kil@@ l@@ ers , or are very ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sive ."
"Because a d@@ aughter can get one X from the father , one X from the mother , it &apos;s kind of di@@ lu@@ ted out ."
"But for a son , he can only get the X chro@@ mo@@ some from his mother ."
So this is how it &apos;s pas@@ sed from mother to son .
"And it has to do with too much brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in during develo@@ pment , which is kind of interesting because ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in is sup@@ posed to make you cal@@ m and re@@ la@@ x@@ ed ."
"But if you have this gen@@ e , in u@@ ter@@ o your brain is ba@@ the@@ d in this , so your whole brain be@@ comes in@@ sen@@ si@@ tive to ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , so it doesn &apos;t work later on in life ."
"And I &apos;d given this one talk in Is@@ ra@@ el , just this past year ."
And it does have some con@@ sequ@@ ences .
"Th@@ e@@ ore@@ ti@@ cally what this means is that in order to ex@@ pre@@ ss this gen@@ e , in a viol@@ ent way , very early on , before pu@@ ber@@ ty , you have to be inv@@ olved in something that is really tra@@ um@@ atic — not a little stre@@ ss , not being sp@@ an@@ ked or something , but really seeing violence , or being inv@@ olved in it , in 3@@ D ."
R@@ ight ? That &apos;s how the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neuro@@ n system works .
"And so , if you have that gen@@ e , and you see a lot of violence in a certain situ@@ ation , this is the re@@ ci@@ pe for disa@@ ster , absolu@@ te disa@@ ster ."
"And what I think might happen in these are@@ as of the world , where we have con@@ st@@ ant violence , you end up having gener@@ ations of kids that are seeing all this violence ."
"And if I was a young girl , some@@ where in a viol@@ ent area , you know , a 14 year old , and I want to find a m@@ ate , I &apos;d find some t@@ ough guy , right , to prote@@ ct me ."
Well what the problem is this ten@@ ds to con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate these gen@@ es .
And now the bo@@ ys and the girls get them .
"So I think after se@@ ver@@ al gener@@ ations , and here is the idea , we really have a t@@ in@@ der@@ box ."
So that was the idea .
"But then my mother said to me , &quot; &quot; I hear you &apos;ve been going around talking about psy@@ ch@@ op@@ a@@ th@@ ic kil@@ l@@ ers ."
"And you &apos;re talking as if you come from a nor@@ mal family . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What the he@@ ll are you talking about ? &quot; &quot; She then told me about our own family t@@ ree ."
"Now she bl@@ am@@ ed this on my father &apos;s side , of course ."
"This was one of these c@@ ases , because she has no violence in her back@@ ground , but my father did ."
"Well she said , &quot; &quot; There is good news and bad news ."
"One of your cou@@ s@@ ins is E@@ z@@ ra C@@ or@@ ne@@ ll , f@@ oun@@ der of C@@ or@@ ne@@ ll uni@@ versity ."
But the bad news is that your cou@@ si@@ n is also Li@@ z@@ z@@ ie B@@ or@@ den .
"Now I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , so what ? We have Li@@ z@@ z@@ ie . &quot; &quot; She goes , &quot; &quot; No it gets wor@@ se , read this book . &quot; &quot; And here is this &quot; &quot; K@@ il@@ led S@@ tr@@ ang@@ ely , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s this histori@@ cal book ."
And the first mu@@ r@@ der of a mother by a son was my gre@@ at@@ -@@ gre@@ at@@ -@@ gre@@ at@@ -@@ gre@@ at@@ -@@ gre@@ at@@ -@@ gre@@ at@@ -@@ grand@@ father .
"O@@ kay , so that &apos;s the first case of mat@@ ri@@ ci@@ de ."
"And that book is very interesting . Because it &apos;s about wit@@ ch tri@@ als , and how people thought back then ."
But it doesn &apos;t stop there .
"There were seven more men , on my father &apos;s side , star@@ ting then , C@@ or@@ ne@@ l@@ ls , that were all mu@@ r@@ der@@ ers ."
"O@@ kay , now this gi@@ ves one a little pa@@ use ."
"( Laughter ) Because my father hi@@ m@@ self , and my three un@@ cles , in World W@@ ar I@@ I , were all con@@ scienti@@ ous obje@@ ct@@ ors , all p@@ us@@ sy@@ cat@@ s ."
"But every once in a while , like Li@@ z@@ z@@ ie B@@ or@@ den , like three times a century , and we &apos;re kind of du@@ e ."
( Laughter ) So the mor@@ al of the story is : people in gl@@ as@@ s h@@ ous@@ es sh@@ ouldn &apos;t th@@ row st@@ ones .
But more li@@ ke@@ ly is this .
( Laughter ) And we had to take action . Now our kids found out about it .
And they all seem@@ ed to be OK .
But our grand@@ kids are going to be kind of con@@ cer@@ ned here .
So what we &apos;ve done is I &apos;ve started to do P@@ E@@ T sc@@ ans of everybody in the family .
"( Laughter ) We started to do P@@ E@@ T sc@@ ans , E@@ E@@ G@@ s and gen@@ e@@ tic an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s to see where the bad news is ."
"Now the only person — it turns out one son and one d@@ aughter , si@@ b@@ lin@@ gs , didn &apos;t get along and their pat@@ ter@@ ns are exactly the same ."
"They have the same brain , and the same E@@ E@@ G ."
And now they are close as can be .
But there &apos;s g@@ on@@ na be bad news some@@ where .
And we don &apos;t know where it &apos;s going to po@@ p up .
So that &apos;s my talk .
( Laughter )
Thank you .
I &apos;m th@@ ri@@ l@@ led to be here .
"I &apos;m going to talk about a new , old materi@@ al that still contin@@ u@@ es to am@@ a@@ ze us , and that might impac@@ t the way we think about materi@@ al science , high technology — and maybe , along the way , also do some stuff for medi@@ cine and for global health and help re@@ fore@@ st@@ ation ."
So that &apos;s kind of a b@@ old stat@@ ement .
I &apos;ll tell you a little bit more .
This materi@@ al actually has some tra@@ its that make it se@@ em almost too good to be true .
"It &apos;s susta@@ in@@ able ; it &apos;s a susta@@ in@@ able materi@@ al that is pro@@ cess@@ ed all in water and at room temper@@ ature — and is bio@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able with a clo@@ ck , so you can wat@@ ch it dis@@ sol@@ ve in@@ stan@@ tan@@ e@@ ously in a gl@@ as@@ s of water or have it st@@ able for years ."
It &apos;s e@@ di@@ ble ; it &apos;s im@@ plan@@ table in the human body without ca@@ using any im@@ mu@@ ne respon@@ se .
It actually gets re@@ inte@@ gr@@ ated in the body .
"And it &apos;s technologi@@ cal , so it can do things like micro@@ ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs , and maybe ph@@ ot@@ oni@@ cs do ."
And the materi@@ al looks something like this .
"In fact , this materi@@ al you see is clear and tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent ."
The com@@ pon@@ ents of this materi@@ al are just water and prote@@ in .
So this materi@@ al is sil@@ k .
So it &apos;s kind of different from what we &apos;re used to thinking about sil@@ k .
"So the question is , how do you re@@ inv@@ ent something that has been around for five mi@@ l@@ len@@ nia ?"
"The process of disco@@ very , gener@@ ally , is inspi@@ red by nature ."
And so we mar@@ vel at sil@@ k wor@@ ms — the sil@@ k wor@@ m you see here sp@@ in@@ ning its fi@@ ber .
"The sil@@ k wor@@ m does a re@@ mark@@ able thing : it uses these two in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ ts , prote@@ in and water , that are in its gl@@ and , to make a materi@@ al that is ex@@ cep@@ tion@@ ally t@@ ough for prote@@ ction — so com@@ par@@ able to techni@@ cal fi@@ bers like K@@ ev@@ lar ."
"And so in the re@@ verse engine@@ ering process that we know about , and that we &apos;re fami@@ li@@ ar with , for the te@@ x@@ ti@@ le indu@@ stry , the te@@ x@@ ti@@ le indu@@ stry goes and un@@ win@@ ds the co@@ co@@ on and then we@@ a@@ ves g@@ la@@ mo@@ rou@@ s things ."
"We want to know how you go from water and prote@@ in to this li@@ qu@@ id K@@ ev@@ lar , to this natural K@@ ev@@ lar ."
So the in@@ si@@ ght is how do you actually re@@ verse engine@@ er this and go from co@@ co@@ on to gl@@ and and get water and prote@@ in that is your star@@ ting materi@@ al .
"And this is an in@@ si@@ ght that came , about two de@@ ca@@ des ago , from a person that I &apos;m very for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate to work with , Davi@@ d K@@ a@@ pl@@ an ."
And so we get this star@@ ting materi@@ al .
And so this star@@ ting materi@@ al is back to the basi@@ c building blo@@ ck .
"And then we use this to do a v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of things — like , for example , this film ."
And we take adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of something that is very simple .
The re@@ ci@@ pe to make those fil@@ ms is to take adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of the fact that prote@@ ins are extre@@ me@@ ly s@@ mar@@ t at what they do .
They find their way to self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ ble .
"So the re@@ ci@@ pe is simple : you take the sil@@ k solution , you po@@ ur it , and you wa@@ it for the prote@@ in to self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ ble ."
"And then you de@@ t@@ ach the prote@@ in and you get this film , as the prote@@ ins find each other as the water ev@@ a@@ por@@ ates ."
But I men@@ tion@@ ed that the film is also technologi@@ cal .
And so what does that mean ?
"It means that you can inter@@ face it with some of the things that are ty@@ pi@@ cal of technology , like micro@@ ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs and n@@ an@@ os@@ c@@ ale technology ."
"And the image of the D@@ V@@ D here is just to il@@ lu@@ str@@ ate a point that sil@@ k fol@@ low@@ s very sub@@ tle to@@ po@@ gra@@ ph@@ ies of the surface , which means that it can re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate fe@@ at@@ ures on the n@@ an@@ os@@ c@@ ale ."
So it would be able to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate the information that is on the D@@ V@@ D .
And we can stor@@ e information that &apos;s film with water and prote@@ in .
"So we tr@@ ied something out , and we wro@@ te a mess@@ age in a piece of sil@@ k , which is right here , and the mess@@ age is over there ."
"And much like in the D@@ V@@ D , you can read it out op@@ ti@@ cally ."
"And this requi@@ res a st@@ able hand , so this is why I decided to do it on@@ st@@ age in front of a thous@@ and people ."
So let me see .
"So as you see the film go in tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ently through there , and then ..."
( Applause ) And the most re@@ mark@@ able fe@@ at is that my hand actually sta@@ yed still long enough to do that .
"So once you have these at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes of this materi@@ al , then you can do a lot of things ."
It &apos;s actually not li@@ mi@@ ted to fil@@ ms .
And so the materi@@ al can as@@ su@@ me a lot of for@@ mat@@ s .
"And then you go a little c@@ razy , and so you do v@@ ari@@ ous op@@ tical com@@ pon@@ ents or you do micro@@ pri@@ sm ar@@ ra@@ ys , like the ref@@ le@@ ctive ta@@ pe that you have on your ru@@ n@@ ning sho@@ es ."
"O@@ r you can do beautiful things that , if the cam@@ era can cap@@ ture , you can make ."
You can ad@@ d a third di@@ men@@ si@@ on@@ ality to the film .
"And if the ang@@ le is right , you can actually see a ho@@ lo@@ gra@@ m ap@@ pe@@ ar in this film of sil@@ k ."
But you can do other things .
"You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pu@@ re prote@@ in to gu@@ i@@ de light , and so we &apos;ve made op@@ tical fi@@ bers ."
But sil@@ k is vers@@ ati@@ le and it goes be@@ y@@ ond op@@ ti@@ cs .
And you can think of different for@@ mat@@ s .
"So for in@@ stance , if you &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id of going to the do@@ ctor and getting stu@@ ck with a need@@ le , we do micro@@ need@@ le ar@@ ra@@ ys ."
What you see there on the scre@@ en is a human ha@@ ir super@@ im@@ posed on the need@@ le that &apos;s made of sil@@ k — just to give you a sense of size .
You can do bi@@ g@@ ger things .
You can do g@@ ear@@ s and nu@@ ts and b@@ ol@@ ts — that you can bu@@ y at Wh@@ ole F@@ o@@ ods .
And the g@@ ear@@ s work in water as well .
So you think of alter@@ n@@ ative mechani@@ cal par@@ ts .
"And maybe you can use that li@@ qu@@ id K@@ ev@@ lar if you need something stron@@ g to re@@ place per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al ve@@ ins , for example , or maybe an entire b@@ one ."
And so you have here a little example of a small sku@@ ll — what we call min@@ i Y@@ ori@@ ck .
"( Laughter ) But you can do things like cu@@ ps , for example , and so , if you ad@@ d a little bit of g@@ old , if you ad@@ d a little bit of se@@ mi@@ con@@ du@@ ct@@ ors you could do sen@@ sor@@ s that sti@@ ck on the sur@@ fac@@ es of fo@@ ods ."
You can do ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic pie@@ ces that f@@ old and w@@ ra@@ p .
"O@@ r if you &apos;re fas@@ hi@@ on forward , some sil@@ k L@@ E@@ D tat@@ to@@ os ."
"So there &apos;s vers@@ ati@@ lity , as you see , in the materi@@ al for@@ mat@@ s , that you can do with sil@@ k ."
But there are still some uni@@ qu@@ e tra@@ its .
"I mean , why would you want to do all these things for real ?"
I men@@ tion@@ ed it br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly at the beginning ; the prote@@ in is bio@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able and bio@@ comp@@ ati@@ ble .
And you see here a picture of a ti@@ s@@ su@@ e se@@ ction .
"And so what does that mean , that it &apos;s bio@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able and bio@@ comp@@ ati@@ ble ?"
You can im@@ pl@@ ant it in the body without ne@@ e@@ ding to re@@ tr@@ ie@@ ve what is im@@ plan@@ ted .
"Wh@@ ich means that all the de@@ vi@@ ces that you &apos;ve seen before and all the for@@ mat@@ s , in prin@@ ci@@ ple , can be im@@ plan@@ ted and disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar ."
"And what you see there in that ti@@ s@@ su@@ e se@@ ction , in fact , is you see that ref@@ le@@ ctor ta@@ pe ."
"So , much like you &apos;re seen at night by a car , then the idea is that you can see , if you il@@ lu@@ min@@ ate ti@@ s@@ su@@ e , you can see de@@ e@@ per par@@ ts of ti@@ s@@ su@@ e because there is that ref@@ le@@ ctive ta@@ pe there that is made out of sil@@ k ."
"And you see there , it gets re@@ inte@@ gr@@ ated in ti@@ s@@ su@@ e ."
"And re@@ inte@@ gr@@ ation in the human body is not the only thing , but re@@ inte@@ gr@@ ation in the environment is important ."
"So you have a clo@@ ck , you have prote@@ in , and now a sil@@ k cu@@ p like this can be th@@ row@@ n away without gu@@ il@@ t — ( Applause ) un@@ like the pol@@ ysty@@ ren@@ e cu@@ ps that un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely fi@@ ll our land@@ fil@@ ls every@@ day ."
"It &apos;s e@@ di@@ ble , so you can do s@@ mar@@ t pac@@ k@@ ag@@ ing around food that you can co@@ ok with the food ."
"It doesn &apos;t ta@@ ste good , so I &apos;m going to need some help with that ."
But probably the most re@@ mark@@ able thing is that it comes full cir@@ cle .
"S@@ il@@ k , during its self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ bly process , ac@@ ts like a co@@ co@@ on for biologi@@ cal matter ."
"And so if you change the re@@ ci@@ pe , and you ad@@ d things when you po@@ ur — so you ad@@ d things to your li@@ qu@@ id sil@@ k solution — where these things are en@@ zy@@ mes or anti@@ bod@@ ies or vac@@ cin@@ es , the self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ bly process pre@@ ser@@ ves the biologi@@ cal fun@@ ction of these dop@@ an@@ ts ."
So it makes the materi@@ als environ@@ ment@@ ally ac@@ tive and inter@@ ac@@ tive .
"So that scre@@ w that you thought about be@@ fore@@ hand can actually be used to scre@@ w a b@@ one together — a f@@ rac@@ tu@@ red b@@ one together — and deli@@ ver dru@@ gs at the same , while your b@@ one is heal@@ ing , for example ."
O@@ r you could put dru@@ gs in your wal@@ let and not in your f@@ ri@@ dge .
So we &apos;ve made a sil@@ k car@@ d with p@@ eni@@ ci@@ lli@@ n in it .
"And we sto@@ red p@@ eni@@ ci@@ lli@@ n at 60 de@@ gre@@ es C , so 1@@ 40 de@@ gre@@ es F@@ a@@ h@@ ren@@ he@@ it , for two months without lo@@ ss of ef@@ fi@@ c@@ acy of the p@@ eni@@ ci@@ lli@@ n ."
"And so that could be — - ( Applause ) that could be poten@@ ti@@ ally a good alter@@ n@@ ative to solar power@@ ed ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ ated cam@@ els . ( Laughter ) And of course , there &apos;s no use in stor@@ age if you can &apos;t use &#91; it &#93; ."
"And so there is this other uni@@ qu@@ e materi@@ al tra@@ it that these materi@@ als have , that they &apos;re progra@@ m@@ m@@ ably de@@ gra@@ d@@ able ."
And so what you see there is the difference .
"In the top , you have a film that has been progra@@ m@@ med not to de@@ gra@@ de , and in the bot@@ tom , a film that has been progra@@ m@@ med to de@@ gra@@ de in water ."
And what you see is that the film on the bot@@ tom rele@@ ases what is inside it .
So it allow@@ s for the re@@ co@@ very of what we &apos;ve sto@@ red before .
And so this allow@@ s for a contro@@ l@@ led deli@@ very of dru@@ gs and for re@@ inte@@ gr@@ ation in the environment in all of these for@@ mat@@ s that you &apos;ve seen .
So the th@@ read of disco@@ very that we have really is a th@@ read .
"We &apos;re im@@ pas@@ si@@ on@@ ed with this idea that whatever you want to do , whether you want to re@@ place a ve@@ in or a b@@ one , or maybe be more susta@@ in@@ able in micro@@ ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs , per@@ haps d@@ r@@ in@@ k a co@@ f@@ fe@@ e in a cu@@ p and th@@ row it away without gu@@ il@@ t , maybe car@@ ry your dru@@ gs in your po@@ ck@@ et , deli@@ ver them inside your body or deli@@ ver them across the des@@ er@@ t , the answer may be in a th@@ read of sil@@ k ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"F@@ i@@ ve years ago , I exper@@ ien@@ ced a bit of what it must have been like to be A@@ li@@ ce in W@@ on@@ der@@ land ."
"P@@ en@@ n St@@ ate asked me , a communi@@ c@@ ations teach@@ er , to te@@ ach a communi@@ c@@ ations clas@@ s for engine@@ ering students ."
"And I was sc@@ ared . ( Laughter ) Re@@ ally sc@@ ared . S@@ car@@ ed of these students with their big bra@@ ins and their big boo@@ ks and their big , un@@ fami@@ li@@ ar words ."
"But as these convers@@ ations un@@ fol@@ ded , I exper@@ ien@@ ced what A@@ li@@ ce must have when she went down that ra@@ b@@ bit ho@@ le and saw that door to a whole new world ."
"That &apos;s just how I felt as I had those convers@@ ations with the students . I was amaz@@ ed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonder@@ land as well ."
And I believe the key to open@@ ing that door is great communi@@ cation .
We des@@ per@@ ately need great communi@@ cation from our scienti@@ sts and engine@@ ers in order to change the world .
"O@@ ur scienti@@ sts and engine@@ ers are the ones that are t@@ ac@@ k@@ ling our grand@@ est challen@@ ges , from energy to environment to health care , am@@ ong others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our respon@@ si@@ bility as n@@ on-@@ scienti@@ sts to have these inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
But these great convers@@ ations can &apos;t oc@@ cu@@ r if our scienti@@ sts and engine@@ ers don &apos;t in@@ vi@@ te us in to see their wonder@@ land .
"So scienti@@ sts and engine@@ ers , ple@@ ase , talk ner@@ dy to us ."
I want to share a few ke@@ ys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is se@@ x@@ y and that your engine@@ ering is eng@@ ag@@ ing .
F@@ ir@@ st question to answer for us : so what ?
T@@ ell us why your science is rele@@ v@@ ant to us .
"D@@ on &apos;t just tell me that you study tra@@ be@@ cu@@ la@@ e , but tell me that you study tra@@ be@@ cu@@ la@@ e , which is the m@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ like structure of our b@@ ones because it &apos;s important to under@@ standing and tre@@ ating ost@@ e@@ o@@ po@@ ro@@ sis ."
"And when you &apos;re descri@@ b@@ ing your science , be@@ w@@ are of j@@ ar@@ g@@ on ."
J@@ ar@@ g@@ on is a bar@@ r@@ ier to our under@@ standing of your ideas .
"S@@ ure , you can say &quot; &quot; sp@@ ati@@ al and tem@@ po@@ ral , &quot; &quot; but why not just say &quot; &quot; space and time , &quot; &quot; which is so much more ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble to us ?"
And making your ideas ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble is not the same as du@@ m@@ b@@ ing it down .
"In@@ ste@@ ad , as E@@ inste@@ in said , make everything as simple as possible , but no sim@@ ple@@ r ."
You can c@@ lear@@ ly communi@@ cate your science without com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ing the ideas .
"A few things to consi@@ der are having exam@@ ples , stories and an@@ al@@ og@@ ies . Th@@ ose are ways to eng@@ age and exci@@ te us about your cont@@ ent ."
"And when pres@@ ent@@ ing your work , dro@@ p the bu@@ l@@ let poin@@ ts ."
"H@@ a@@ ve you ever wonder@@ ed why they &apos;re called bu@@ l@@ let poin@@ ts ? ( Laughter ) What do bu@@ l@@ le@@ ts do ? Bu@@ l@@ le@@ ts ki@@ ll , and they will ki@@ ll your pres@@ ent@@ ation ."
"A sli@@ de like this is not only bor@@ ing , but it rel@@ ies too much on the language area of our brain , and ca@@ uses us to become over@@ wh@@ el@@ med ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , this example sli@@ de by G@@ en@@ ev@@ ie@@ ve B@@ row@@ n is much more effe@@ ctive . It &apos;s show@@ ing that the spe@@ cial structure of tra@@ be@@ cu@@ la@@ e are so stron@@ g that they actually inspi@@ red the uni@@ qu@@ e design of the E@@ i@@ f@@ fe@@ l T@@ ow@@ er ."
"And the tri@@ ck here is to use a single , re@@ ad@@ able s@@ ent@@ ence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provi@@ de vi@@ su@@ als which ap@@ pe@@ al to our other sen@@ ses and create a de@@ e@@ per sense of under@@ standing of what &apos;s being descri@@ bed ."
So I think these are just a few ke@@ ys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonder@@ land that is science and engine@@ ering .
"And because the engine@@ ers that I &apos;ve worked with have t@@ au@@ ght me to become really in tou@@ ch with my in@@ ner ner@@ d , I want to sum@@ mar@@ i@@ ze with an equ@@ ation . ( Laughter ) T@@ ake your science , sub@@ trac@@ t your bu@@ l@@ let poin@@ ts and your j@@ ar@@ g@@ on , di@@ vi@@ de by rele@@ v@@ ance , me@@ an@@ ing share what &apos;s rele@@ v@@ ant to the audience , and mul@@ ti@@ ply it by the pas@@ sion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equ@@ al incredible inter@@ ac@@ tions that are full of under@@ standing ."
"And so , scienti@@ sts and engine@@ ers , when you &apos;ve sol@@ ved this equ@@ ation , by all means , talk ner@@ dy to me . ( Laughter ) Thank you . ( Applause )"
So I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about re@@ imag@@ ining food .
I &apos;ve been interested in food for a long time .
I t@@ au@@ ght myself to co@@ ok with a bu@@ n@@ ch of big boo@@ ks like this .
I went to che@@ f school in Fran@@ ce .
"And there is a way the world both en@@ vi@@ sions food , the way the world wri@@ tes about food and lear@@ ns about food ."
And it &apos;s lar@@ ge@@ ly what you would find in these boo@@ ks .
And it &apos;s a wonderful thing .
But there &apos;s some things that have been going on since this idea of food was est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed .
"In the last 20 years , people have realized that science has a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous amount to do with food ."
"In fact , under@@ standing why co@@ o@@ king works requi@@ res know@@ ing the science of co@@ o@@ king — some of the chemi@@ stry , some of the physi@@ cs and so for@@ th ."
But that &apos;s not in any of those boo@@ ks .
"There &apos;s also a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous number of techni@@ qu@@ es that ch@@ ef@@ s have develo@@ ped , some about new a@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ cs , new appro@@ ach@@ es to food ."
There &apos;s a che@@ f in S@@ pa@@ in na@@ med F@@ er@@ ran A@@ dri@@ a .
He &apos;s develo@@ ped a very av@@ an@@ t-@@ gar@@ de cu@@ is@@ ine .
"A guy in En@@ gl@@ and called H@@ est@@ on B@@ lu@@ men@@ th@@ al , he &apos;s develo@@ ped his av@@ an@@ t-@@ gar@@ de cu@@ is@@ ine ."
N@@ one of the techni@@ qu@@ es that these people have develo@@ ped over the course of the last 20 years is in any of those boo@@ ks .
N@@ one of them are t@@ au@@ ght in co@@ o@@ king scho@@ ols .
"In order to learn them , you have to go work in those re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts ."
"And finally , there &apos;s the old way of vie@@ w@@ ing food is the old way ."
"And so a few years ago — f@@ ours years ago , actually — I set out to say , is there a way we can communi@@ cate science and techni@@ qu@@ e and won@@ der ?"
Is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before ?
"So we tr@@ ied , and I &apos;ll show you what we came up with ."
This is a picture called a cu@@ ta@@ way .
This is actually the first picture I took in the book .
The idea here is to expla@@ in what happens when you ste@@ am bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
And this mag@@ ic view allow@@ s you to see all of what &apos;s happening while the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ste@@ am@@ s .
Th@@ en each of the different little pie@@ ces around it expla@@ in some fact .
And the hope was two@@ -@@ f@@ old .
One is you can actually expla@@ in what happens when you ste@@ am bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
"But the other thing is that maybe we could se@@ du@@ ce people into stuff that was a little more techni@@ cal , maybe a little bit more scienti@@ fic , maybe a little bit more ch@@ ef@@ -@@ y than they o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se would have ."
"Because with that beautiful ph@@ oto , maybe I can also pac@@ k@@ age this little box here that tal@@ ks about how ste@@ am@@ ing and bo@@ il@@ ing actually take different amoun@@ ts of time ."
Ste@@ am@@ ing ou@@ ght to be f@@ ast@@ er .
"It turns out it isn &apos;t because of something called film con@@ den@@ s@@ ation , and this expla@@ ins that ."
"Well , that first cu@@ ta@@ way picture worked , so we said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , let &apos;s do some more . &quot; &quot; So here &apos;s another one ."
We disco@@ vered why wo@@ ks are the sha@@ pe they are .
This sha@@ ped wo@@ k doesn &apos;t work very well ; this ca@@ u@@ ght fi@@ re three times .
"But we had a phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y , which is it only has to look good for a thous@@ and@@ th of a second ."
( Laughter ) And one of our can@@ ning cu@@ ta@@ ways .
"O@@ n@@ ce you start cu@@ tting things in half , you kind of get car@@ ried away , so you see we cut the j@@ ars in half as well as the p@@ an ."
And each of these te@@ xt blo@@ cks expla@@ ins a key thing that &apos;s going on .
"In this case , bo@@ il@@ ing water can@@ ning is for can@@ ning things that are already pretty aci@@ di@@ c ."
You don &apos;t have to he@@ at them up as ho@@ t as you would something you do pres@@ sure can@@ ning because bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al spo@@ res can &apos;t gro@@ w in the ac@@ id .
"So this is great for pi@@ ck@@ led ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les , which is what we &apos;re can@@ ning here ."
Here &apos;s our ha@@ m@@ bur@@ ger cu@@ ta@@ way .
One of our phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ ies in the book is that no di@@ sh is really in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ cally any better than any other di@@ sh .
"So you can la@@ vi@@ sh all the same care , all the same techni@@ qu@@ e , on a ha@@ m@@ bur@@ ger as you would on some much more fan@@ cy di@@ sh ."
"And if you do la@@ vi@@ sh as much techni@@ qu@@ e as possible , and you try to make the high@@ est qu@@ ality ha@@ m@@ bur@@ ger , it gets to be a little bit inv@@ olved ."
"The New York T@@ im@@ es ran a piece after my book was de@@ la@@ yed and it was called &quot; &quot; The W@@ a@@ it for the 3@@ 0-@@ H@@ our H@@ am@@ bur@@ ger J@@ ust G@@ ot Lon@@ ger . &quot; &quot; Because our ha@@ m@@ bur@@ ger re@@ ci@@ pe , our ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate ha@@ m@@ bur@@ ger re@@ ci@@ pe , if you make the bu@@ ns and you mar@@ in@@ ate the me@@ at and you do all this stuff , it does take about 30 hours ."
"O@@ f course , you &apos;re not actually working the whole time ."
Mo@@ st of the time is kind of sitting there .
"The point of this cu@@ ta@@ way is to show people a view of ha@@ m@@ bur@@ g@@ ers they ha@@ ven &apos;t seen before and to expla@@ in the physi@@ cs of ha@@ m@@ bur@@ g@@ ers and the chemi@@ stry of ha@@ m@@ bur@@ g@@ ers , because , believe it or not , there is something to the physi@@ cs and chemi@@ stry — in particular , those fl@@ am@@ es under@@ ne@@ ath the bur@@ ger ."
Mo@@ st of the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ stic char@@ -@@ g@@ ri@@ l@@ led ta@@ ste doesn &apos;t come from the wood or the char@@ co@@ al .
Bu@@ ying m@@ es@@ quite char@@ co@@ al will not actually make that much difference .
"M@@ ost@@ ly it comes from f@@ at py@@ rol@@ yz@@ ing , or bur@@ ning ."
So it &apos;s the f@@ at that dri@@ ps down and f@@ lar@@ es up that ca@@ uses the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ stic ta@@ ste .
"Now you might won@@ der , how do we make these cu@@ ta@@ ways ?"
Mo@@ st people as@@ su@@ me we use P@@ hot@@ o@@ sho@@ p .
"And the answer is : no , not really ; we use a mach@@ ine sho@@ p ."
"And it turns out , the best way to cut things in half is to actually cut them in half ."
So we have two hal@@ ves of one of the best k@@ it@@ ch@@ ens in the world .
"( Laughter ) We cut a $ 5@@ ,000 re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant o@@ ven in half ."
"The man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ re@@ r said , &quot; What would it take for you to cut one in half ? &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It would have to show up f@@ ree . &quot; &quot; And so it show@@ ed up , we used it a little while , we cut it in half ."
Now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these sh@@ ots .
We would g@@ lu@@ e a piece of P@@ y@@ re@@ x or he@@ at@@ -@@ resi@@ st@@ ant gl@@ as@@ s in front .
"We used a red , very high-@@ temper@@ ature si@@ lic@@ on to do that ."
"The great thing is , when you cut something in half , you have another half ."
"So you photogra@@ ph that in exactly the same posi@@ tion , and then you can sub@@ stitu@@ te in — and that part does use P@@ hot@@ o@@ sho@@ p — just the ed@@ ges ."
"So it &apos;s very much like in a H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood movie where a guy fl@@ ies through the air , sup@@ por@@ ted by wi@@ res , and then they take the wi@@ res away di@@ gi@@ t@@ ally so you &apos;re fl@@ ying through the air ."
"In most c@@ ases , though , there was no gl@@ as@@ s ."
"L@@ i@@ ke for the ha@@ m@@ bur@@ ger , we just cut the dam@@ n bar@@ be@@ cu@@ e ."
"And so those co@@ als that ke@@ pt fal@@ ling off the ed@@ ge , we ke@@ pt having to put them back up ."
"But again , it only has to work for a thous@@ and@@ th of a second ."
The wo@@ k sh@@ ot ca@@ u@@ ght fi@@ re three times .
What happens when you have your wo@@ k cut in half is the oil goes down into the fi@@ re and wh@@ o@@ os@@ h !
One of our co@@ o@@ ks lost his e@@ ye@@ b@@ row@@ s that way .
"But h@@ ey , they gro@@ w back ."
"In ad@@ di@@ tion to cu@@ ta@@ ways , we also expla@@ in physi@@ cs ."
This is F@@ our@@ ier &apos;s la@@ w of he@@ at con@@ du@@ ction .
It &apos;s a parti@@ al differ@@ enti@@ al equ@@ ation .
We have the only co@@ ok@@ book in the world that has parti@@ al differ@@ enti@@ al equ@@ ations in it .
"But to make them pal@@ at@@ able , we cut it out of a ste@@ el pl@@ ate and put it in front of a fi@@ re and photograph@@ ed it like this ."
We &apos;ve got lots of little ti@@ d@@ bi@@ ts in the book .
"E@@ very@@ body know@@ s that your v@@ ari@@ ous app@@ li@@ an@@ ces have wat@@ t@@ age , right ?"
But you probably don &apos;t know that much about J@@ am@@ es W@@ at@@ t .
But now you will ; we put a bi@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y of J@@ am@@ es W@@ at@@ t in .
"It &apos;s a little couple par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s to expla@@ in why we call that uni@@ t of he@@ at the wat@@ t , and where he got his in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation ."
It turned out he was hi@@ red by a S@@ c@@ ot@@ ti@@ sh di@@ st@@ il@@ l@@ ery to understand why they were bur@@ ning so dam@@ n much pe@@ at to di@@ still the whi@@ sk@@ ey .
We also did a lot of cal@@ cul@@ ation .
I per@@ son@@ ally wro@@ te thousands of lin@@ es of c@@ od@@ e to write this co@@ ok@@ book .
"H@@ ere &apos;s a cal@@ cul@@ ation that shows how the inten@@ sity of a bar@@ be@@ cu@@ e , or other radi@@ ant he@@ at source , goes as you move away from it ."
"So as you move ver@@ ti@@ cally away from this surface , the he@@ at fal@@ ls off ."
"As you move side to side , it mo@@ ves off ."
That hor@@ n@@ -@@ sha@@ ped regi@@ on is what we call the s@@ we@@ et spo@@ t .
That &apos;s the place where the he@@ at is even to within 10 percent .
So that &apos;s the place where you really want to co@@ ok .
"And it &apos;s got this fun@@ ny hor@@ n@@ -@@ sha@@ ped thing , which as far as I know , again , the first co@@ ok@@ book to ever do this ."
Now it may also be the last co@@ ok@@ book that ever does it .
"You know , there &apos;s two ways you can make a produ@@ ct ."
"You can do lots of market research and do fo@@ cus grou@@ ps and figure out what people really want , or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it ."
Here &apos;s a ste@@ p@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ ste@@ p that shows gr@@ in@@ ding ha@@ m@@ bur@@ ger .
"If you really want great ha@@ m@@ bur@@ ger , it turns out it makes a difference if you ali@@ g@@ n the gra@@ in ."
"And it &apos;s really simple , as you can see here ."
"As it comes out of the gr@@ in@@ der , you just have a little tra@@ y , and you just take it off in little pas@@ ses , build it up , sli@@ ce it ver@@ ti@@ cally ."
Here &apos;s the fin@@ al ha@@ m@@ bur@@ ger .
This is the 3@@ 0-@@ hour ha@@ m@@ bur@@ ger .
We make every aspe@@ ct of this bur@@ ger .
The let@@ tu@@ ce has got li@@ qu@@ id smo@@ ke in@@ f@@ used into it .
We also have things about how to make the bu@@ n .
"There &apos;s a mus@@ h@@ room , ke@@ t@@ ch@@ up — it goes on and on ."
Now wat@@ ch clo@@ se@@ ly . This is po@@ p@@ cor@@ n . I &apos;ll expla@@ in it here .
The po@@ p@@ cor@@ n is il@@ lu@@ str@@ ating a key thing in physi@@ cs .
I@@ sn &apos;t that beautiful ?
"We have a very high-@@ speed cam@@ era , which we had lots of fun with on the book ."
"The key physi@@ cs prin@@ ci@@ ple here is when water bo@@ il@@ s to ste@@ am it ex@@ p@@ ands by a fac@@ tor of 1@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 ."
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening to the water inside that po@@ p@@ cor@@ n .
So it &apos;s a great il@@ lu@@ str@@ ation of that .
Now I &apos;m going to close with a video that is kind of un@@ usu@@ al .
We have a ch@@ ap@@ ter on g@@ els .
"And because people wat@@ ch M@@ y@@ th@@ bu@@ st@@ ers and C@@ S@@ I , I thought , well , let &apos;s put in a re@@ ci@@ pe for a bal@@ li@@ sti@@ cs g@@ el@@ at@@ in ."
"Well , if you have a high-@@ speed cam@@ era , and you have a blo@@ ck of bal@@ li@@ sti@@ cs g@@ el@@ at@@ in l@@ ying around , pretty so@@ on somebody does this ."
( G@@ as@@ ps ) Now the amazing thing here is that a bal@@ li@@ sti@@ cs g@@ el@@ at@@ in is sup@@ posed to mi@@ mi@@ c what happens to human fl@@ es@@ h when you get sh@@ ot — that &apos;s why you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t get sh@@ ot .
"The other amazing thing is , when this bal@@ li@@ sti@@ cs g@@ el@@ at@@ in comes down , it fal@@ ls back down as a nice blo@@ ck ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , here &apos;s the book ."
Here it is .
"@@ 2@@ ,@@ 4@@ 3@@ 8 p@@ ages ."
And they &apos;re nice big p@@ ages too .
"( Applause ) A friend of m@@ ine com@@ pla@@ ined that this was too big and too pretty to go in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , so there &apos;s a si@@ x@@ th v@@ olu@@ me that has wa@@ sha@@ ble , wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of pa@@ per . ( Applause )"
There &apos;s a group of people in Ken@@ ya .
Pe@@ ople c@@ ross oce@@ ans to go see them .
These people are t@@ all .
They j@@ um@@ p high . They we@@ ar red .
And they ki@@ ll li@@ ons .
"You might be wonder@@ ing , who are these people ?"
These are the Ma@@ as@@ a@@ is .
And you know what &apos;s cool ? I &apos;m actually one of them .
"The Ma@@ as@@ a@@ is , the bo@@ ys are brought up to be war@@ ri@@ ors ."
The girls are brought up to be mo@@ thers .
"When I was five years old , I found out that I was eng@@ aged to be mar@@ ried as so@@ on as I re@@ ach@@ ed pu@@ ber@@ ty ."
"My mother , my grand@@ mother , my a@@ un@@ ties , they con@@ stan@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me that your h@@ us@@ b@@ and just pas@@ sed by ."
"( Laughter ) Co@@ ol , ye@@ ah ?"
And everything I had to do from that moment was to pre@@ p@@ are me to be a perfe@@ ct woman at age 12 .
"My day started at 5 in the morning , mi@@ l@@ king the c@@ ow@@ s , s@@ wee@@ ping the house , co@@ o@@ king for my si@@ b@@ lin@@ gs , colle@@ cting water , fi@@ re@@ wood ."
I did everything that I needed to do to become a perfe@@ ct wi@@ fe .
I went to school not because the Ma@@ as@@ a@@ is &apos; women or girls were going to school .
"It &apos;s because my mother was den@@ ied an education , and she con@@ stan@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me and my si@@ b@@ lin@@ gs that she never wanted us to live the life she was living ."
Why did she say that ?
My father worked as a poli@@ c@@ em@@ an in the city .
He came home once a year .
We didn &apos;t see him for sometimes even two years .
"And wh@@ en@@ ever he came home , it was a different case ."
My mother worked hard in the far@@ m to gro@@ w cro@@ ps so that we can e@@ at .
She re@@ ared the c@@ ow@@ s and the go@@ ats so that she can care for us .
"But when my father came , he would se@@ ll the c@@ ow@@ s , he would se@@ ll the produ@@ cts we had , and he went and d@@ ran@@ k with his friends in the bar@@ s ."
"Because my mother was a woman , she was not allow@@ ed to own any pro@@ per@@ ty , and by def@@ au@@ l@@ t , everything in my family any@@ way be@@ lon@@ gs to my father , so he had the right ."
"And if my mother ever questi@@ on@@ ed him , he be@@ at her , ab@@ used her , and really it was difficult ."
"When I went to school , I had a dre@@ am ."
I wanted to become a teach@@ er .
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers looked nice .
"They we@@ ar nice dre@@ s@@ ses , high-@@ he@@ e@@ led sho@@ es ."
"I found out later that they are un@@ comfor@@ table , but I ad@@ mi@@ red it ."
"( Laughter ) But most of all , the teach@@ er was just writing on the bo@@ ard — not hard work , that &apos;s what I thought , com@@ par@@ ed to what I was doing in the far@@ m ."
So I wanted to become a teach@@ er .
"I worked hard in school , but when I was in e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , it was a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ing fac@@ tor ."
"In our tra@@ di@@ tion , there is a cer@@ em@@ ony that girls have to under@@ go to become women , and it &apos;s a ri@@ te of pas@@ s@@ age to wom@@ an@@ ho@@ od ."
"And then I was just fini@@ sh@@ ing my e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , and that was a tran@@ si@@ tion for me to go to high school ."
This was the cro@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ad .
"O@@ n@@ ce I go through this tra@@ di@@ tion , I was going to become a wi@@ fe ."
"Well , my dre@@ am of be@@ coming a teach@@ er will not come to pas@@ s ."
So I tal@@ ked — I had to come up with a pl@@ an to figure these things out .
I tal@@ ked to my father . I did something that most girls have never done .
"I told my father , &quot; &quot; I will only go through this cer@@ em@@ ony if you let me go back to school . &quot; &quot; The reason why , if I ran away , my father will have a sti@@ g@@ ma , people will be cal@@ ling him the father of that girl who didn &apos;t go through the cer@@ em@@ ony ."
It was a sha@@ me@@ ful thing for him to car@@ ry the rest of his life .
"So he figu@@ red out . &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; o@@ kay , you &apos;ll go to school after the cer@@ em@@ ony . &quot; &quot; I did . The cer@@ em@@ ony happened ."
It &apos;s a whole week long of exci@@ tem@@ ent .
It &apos;s a cer@@ em@@ ony . Pe@@ ople are en@@ jo@@ ying it .
"And the day before the ac@@ tu@@ al cer@@ em@@ ony happens , we were dan@@ cing , having exci@@ tem@@ ent , and through all the night we did not sle@@ ep ."
"The ac@@ tu@@ al day came , and we wal@@ ked out of the house that we were dan@@ cing in . Yes , we dan@@ ced and dan@@ ced ."
"We wal@@ ked out to the cour@@ ty@@ ard , and there were a bu@@ n@@ ch of people wai@@ ting ."
They were all in a cir@@ cle .
"And as we dan@@ ced and dan@@ ced , and we appro@@ ach@@ ed this cir@@ cle of women , men , women , children , everybody was there ."
"There was a woman sitting in the mi@@ ddle of it , and this woman was wai@@ ting to h@@ old us ."
"I was the first . There were my si@@ st@@ ers and a couple of other girls , and as I appro@@ ach@@ ed her , she looked at me , and I s@@ at down ."
"And I s@@ at down , and I open@@ ed my le@@ gs ."
"As I open@@ ed my le@@ g , another woman came , and this woman was car@@ ry@@ ing a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And as she car@@ ried the k@@ ni@@ fe , she wal@@ ked tow@@ ard me and she he@@ ld the c@@ lit@@ or@@ is , and she cut it off ."
"As you can imagine , I b@@ led . I b@@ led ."
"A@@ f@@ ter b@@ le@@ e@@ ding for a while , I fa@@ in@@ ted ther@@ e@@ after ."
"It &apos;s something that so many girls — I &apos;m lu@@ ck@@ y , I never d@@ ied — but many die ."
"It &apos;s prac@@ ti@@ ced , it &apos;s no an@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a , it &apos;s a ru@@ sty old k@@ ni@@ fe , and it was difficult ."
"I was lu@@ ck@@ y because one , also , my mo@@ m did something that most women don &apos;t do ."
"Th@@ ree days later , after everybody has left the home , my mo@@ m went and brought a n@@ ur@@ se ."
We were taken care of .
"Th@@ ree weeks later , I was heal@@ ed , and I was back in high school ."
I was so de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to be a teach@@ er now so that I could make a difference in my family .
"Well , while I was in high school , something happened ."
I met a young g@@ ent@@ le@@ man from our vi@@ ll@@ age who had been to the Uni@@ versity of O@@ re@@ g@@ on .
"This man was we@@ aring a white t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t , je@@ ans , cam@@ era , white s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers — and I &apos;m talking about white s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers ."
"There is something about clo@@ the@@ s , I think , and sho@@ es ."
"They were s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers , and this is in a vi@@ ll@@ age that doesn &apos;t even have pa@@ ved ro@@ ads . It was quite at@@ trac@@ tive ."
"I told him , &quot; &quot; Well , I want to go to where you are , &quot; &quot; because this man looked very happy , and I ad@@ mi@@ red that ."
"And he told me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you mean , you want to go ?"
"D@@ on &apos;t you have a h@@ us@@ b@@ and wai@@ ting for you ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that part ."
"J@@ ust tell me how to get there . &quot; &quot; This g@@ ent@@ le@@ man , he hel@@ ped me ."
"W@@ hi@@ le I was in high school also , my d@@ ad was si@@ ck ."
"He got a stro@@ ke , and he was really , really si@@ ck , so he really couldn &apos;t tell me what to do next ."
"But the problem is , my father is not the only father I have ."
"E@@ very@@ body who is my d@@ ad &apos;s age , m@@ ale in the community , is my father by def@@ au@@ l@@ t — my un@@ cles , all of them — and they di@@ ct@@ ate what my future is ."
"So the news came , I ap@@ pl@@ ied to school and I was ac@@ cep@@ ted to R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph@@ -@@ M@@ ac@@ on W@@ om@@ an &apos;s Col@@ le@@ ge in L@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ bur@@ g , V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , and I couldn &apos;t come without the sup@@ port of the vi@@ ll@@ age , because I needed to ra@@ ise money to bu@@ y the air ti@@ ck@@ et ."
I got a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship but I needed to get myself here .
"But I needed the sup@@ port of the vi@@ ll@@ age , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had got@@ ten an opportunity to go to school , they said , &quot; &quot; What a lost opportunity ."
This should have been given to a bo@@ y . We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; So I went back and I had to go back to the tra@@ di@@ tion .
There &apos;s a belie@@ f am@@ ong our people that morning br@@ ings good news .
"So I had to come up with something to do with the morning , because there &apos;s good news in the morning ."
"And in the vi@@ ll@@ age also , there is one ch@@ ie@@ f , an el@@ der , who if he says y@@ es , everybody will fol@@ low him ."
"So I went to him very early in the morning , as the su@@ n ro@@ se ."
"The first thing he se@@ es when he open@@ s his door is , it &apos;s me ."
"&quot; My child , what are you doing here ? &quot;"
"&quot; Well , D@@ ad , I need help . C@@ an you sup@@ port me to go to America ? &quot;"
"I pro@@ mis@@ ed him that I would be the best girl , I will come back , anything they wanted after that , I will do it for them ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , but I can &apos;t do it alone . &quot; &quot; He gave me a li@@ st of another 15 men that I went — 16 more men — every single morning I went and visi@@ ted them ."
They all came together .
"The vi@@ ll@@ age , the women , the men , everybody came together to sup@@ port me to come to get an education ."
"I ar@@ ri@@ ved in America . A@@ s you can imagine , what did I find ?"
I found s@@ now !
"I found W@@ al@@ -@@ Mar@@ ts , vac@@ u@@ um cle@@ an@@ ers , and lots of food in the ca@@ fe@@ ter@@ ia ."
I was in a land of pl@@ en@@ ty .
"I en@@ jo@@ yed myself , but during that moment while I was here , I disco@@ vered a lot of things ."
"I learned that that cer@@ em@@ ony that I went through when I was 1@@ 3 years old , it was called fe@@ m@@ ale g@@ eni@@ tal mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation ."
I learned that it was against the la@@ w in Ken@@ ya .
I learned that I did not have to tra@@ de part of my body to get an education . I had a right .
"And as we speak right now , three million girls in Africa are at ri@@ sk of going through this mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation ."
I learned that my mo@@ m had a right to own pro@@ per@@ ty .
I learned that she did not have to be ab@@ used because she is a woman .
Th@@ ose things made me ang@@ ry .
I wanted to do something .
"As I went back , every time I went , I found that my neigh@@ b@@ ors &apos; girls were getting mar@@ ried ."
"They were getting mu@@ ti@@ lated , and here , after I gra@@ du@@ ated from here , I worked at the U.@@ N@@ . , I went back to school to get my gra@@ du@@ ate work , the con@@ st@@ ant c@@ ry of these girls was in my face ."
I had to do something .
"As I went back , I started talking to the men , to the vi@@ ll@@ age , and mo@@ thers , and I said , &quot; &quot; I want to give back the way I had pro@@ mis@@ ed you that I would come back and help you . What do you need ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s I spo@@ ke to the women , they told me , &quot; You know what we need ? We really need a school for girls . &quot;"
Because there had not been any school for girls .
"And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is ra@@ ped when she &apos;s wal@@ king to school , the mother is bl@@ am@@ ed for that ."
"If she got pre@@ gn@@ ant before she got mar@@ ried , the mother is bl@@ am@@ ed for that , and she &apos;s pu@@ ni@@ shed ."
She &apos;s be@@ at@@ en .
"They said , &quot; &quot; We wanted to put our girls in a sa@@ fe place . &quot; &quot; A@@ s we mo@@ ved , and I went to talk to the fa@@ thers , the fa@@ thers , of course , you can imagine what they said : &quot; We want a school for bo@@ ys . &quot;"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there are a couple of men from my vi@@ ll@@ age who have been out and they have got@@ ten an education ."
"Wh@@ y can &apos;t they build a school for bo@@ ys , and I &apos;ll build a school for girls ? &quot; &quot; That made sense . And they ag@@ re@@ ed ."
"And I told them , I wanted them to show me a sig@@ n of com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment ."
And they did . They d@@ on@@ ated land where we built the girls &apos; school .
We have .
I want you to me@@ et one of the girls in that school .
"A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ ine came to app@@ ly for the school , and she did not me@@ et any cri@@ ter@@ ia that we had ."
"S@@ he &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an . Yes , we could have taken her for that ."
"But she was ol@@ der . She was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
"A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ ine had been moving from one place — because she &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an , she has no mother , she has no father — moving from one grand@@ mother &apos;s house to another one , from a@@ un@@ ties to a@@ un@@ ties . She had no st@@ ability in her life ."
"And I looked at her , I remember that day , and I saw something be@@ y@@ ond what I was seeing in An@@ g@@ el@@ ine ."
"And y@@ es , she was ol@@ der to be in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
We gave her the opportunity to come to the clas@@ s .
"F@@ i@@ ve months later , that is An@@ g@@ el@@ ine ."
A trans@@ form@@ ation had be@@ gu@@ n in her life .
An@@ g@@ el@@ ine wan@@ ts to be a pi@@ lot so she can f@@ ly around the world and make a difference .
She was not the top stud@@ ent when we took her .
"Now she &apos;s the best stud@@ ent , not just in our school , but in the entire di@@ vision that we are in ."
That &apos;s S@@ ha@@ ro@@ n . That &apos;s five years later .
"That &apos;s E@@ v@@ el@@ y@@ n . F@@ i@@ ve months later , that is the difference that we are making ."
"As a new daw@@ n is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening ."
"As we speak right now , 1@@ 25 girls will never be mu@@ ti@@ lated ."
One hundre@@ d tw@@ en@@ ty@@ -@@ five girls will not be mar@@ ried when they &apos;re 12 years old .
One hundre@@ d tw@@ en@@ ty@@ -@@ five girls are cre@@ ating and ach@@ ie@@ ving their dre@@ am@@ s .
"This is the thing that we are doing , gi@@ ving them opportuni@@ ties where they can ri@@ se ."
"As we speak right now , women are not being be@@ at@@ en because of the re@@ v@@ olu@@ tions we &apos;ve started in our community ."
( Applause ) I want to challen@@ ge you today .
"You are list@@ ening to me because you are here , very op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic ."
You are somebody who is so pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see a better world .
"You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see that war en@@ ds , no po@@ ver@@ ty ."
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make a difference .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make our tom@@ or@@ row better .
"I want to challen@@ ge you today that to be the first , because people will fol@@ low you ."
B@@ e the first . Pe@@ ople will fol@@ low you .
B@@ e b@@ old . St@@ and up . B@@ e fe@@ ar@@ less . B@@ e con@@ fi@@ dent .
"Mo@@ ve out , because as you change your world , as you change your community , as we believe that we are impac@@ ting one girl , one family , one vi@@ ll@@ age , one country at a time ."
"We are making a difference , so if you change your world , you are going to change your community , you are going to change your country , and think about that . If you do that , and I do that , ar@@ en &apos;t we going to create a better future for our children , for your children , for our grand@@ children ?"
And we will live in a very pe@@ ace@@ ful world . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
We can turn data into a ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se view of a global econom@@ y in moti@@ on .
"And by trac@@ king mark@@ ers on an in@@ se@@ ct &apos;s w@@ ings , we can vi@@ su@@ ali@@ ze the air f@@ low that they produ@@ ce ."
C@@ an you gu@@ ess what this is ?
A cat@@ er@@ pi@@ ll@@ ar &apos;s m@@ outh .
A@@ n e@@ gg@@ sh@@ ell .
This jour@@ ney will take us all the way down to the n@@ ano world .
The sil@@ k is 100 times thin@@ ner than human ha@@ ir .
"T@@ on@@ ight , I want to have a convers@@ ation about this incredible global issue that &apos;s at the inter@@ se@@ ction of land use , food and environment , something we can all rel@@ ate to , and what I &apos;ve been cal@@ ling the other in@@ con@@ ven@@ ien@@ t tru@@ th ."
"But first , I want to take you on a little jour@@ ney ."
"L@@ et &apos;s first visi@@ t our planet , but at night , and from space ."
"This is what our planet looks like from ou@@ ter space at ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time , if you were to take a s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te and tra@@ vel around the planet . And the thing you would noti@@ ce first , of course , is how dom@@ in@@ ant the human pre@@ sen@@ ce on our planet is ."
"We see cities , we see oil fie@@ l@@ ds , you can even make out fi@@ sh@@ ing f@@ le@@ ets in the se@@ a , that we are dom@@ in@@ ating much of our planet , and mo@@ st@@ ly through the use of energy that we see here at night ."
But let &apos;s go back and dro@@ p it a little de@@ e@@ per and look during the da@@ y@@ time .
What we see during the day is our land@@ s@@ cap@@ es .
"This is part of the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on B@@ a@@ si@@ n , a place called R@@ on@@ d@@ ô@@ nia in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ cen@@ ter part of the B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ an A@@ ma@@ z@@ on ."
"If you look really car@@ e@@ fully in the u@@ pp@@ er ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand cor@@ ner , you &apos;re going to see a th@@ in white line , which is a ro@@ ad that was built in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
"If we come back to the same place in 200@@ 1 , what we &apos;re going to find is that these ro@@ ads sp@@ ur@@ t off more ro@@ ads , and more ro@@ ads after that , at the end of which is a small c@@ lear@@ ing in the ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st where there are going to be a few c@@ ow@@ s ."
These c@@ ow@@ s are used for be@@ e@@ f . We &apos;re going to e@@ at these c@@ ow@@ s .
"And these c@@ ow@@ s are e@@ at@@ en basically in S@@ outh America , in B@@ raz@@ il and Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ ina . They &apos;re not being shi@@ pped up here ."
"But this kind of fi@@ sh@@ b@@ one pat@@ ter@@ n of de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation is something we noti@@ ce a lot of around the tro@@ pi@@ cs , es@@ pe@@ cially in this part of the world ."
"If we go a little bit f@@ ur@@ ther s@@ outh in our little t@@ our of the world , we can go to the Bo@@ li@@ vi@@ an ed@@ ge of the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , here also in 19@@ 7@@ 5 , and if you look really car@@ e@@ fully , there &apos;s a th@@ in white line through that kind of se@@ am , and there &apos;s a l@@ one farm@@ er out there in the mi@@ ddle of the pri@@ me@@ v@@ al j@@ un@@ g@@ le ."
"L@@ et &apos;s come back again a few years later , here in 200@@ 3 , and we &apos;ll see that that land@@ s@@ cape actually looks a lot more like I@@ owa than it does like a ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st ."
"In fact , what you &apos;re seeing here are so@@ y@@ be@@ an fie@@ l@@ ds ."
"These so@@ y@@ be@@ ans are being shi@@ pped to Europ@@ e and to China as ani@@ mal fe@@ ed , es@@ pe@@ cially after the ma@@ d c@@ ow dise@@ ase sc@@ are about a dec@@ ade ago , where we don &apos;t want to fe@@ ed animals ani@@ mal prote@@ in any@@ more , because that can trans@@ m@@ it dise@@ ase ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , we want to fe@@ ed them more ve@@ ge@@ table prote@@ ins ."
"So so@@ y@@ be@@ ans have really ex@@ plo@@ ded , show@@ ing how tra@@ de and glob@@ aliz@@ ation are really respon@@ si@@ ble for the conne@@ ctions to ra@@ in@@ fore@@ sts and the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on — an incredi@@ bly str@@ ange and inter@@ conne@@ cted world that we have today ."
"Well , again and again , what we find as we look around the world in our little t@@ our of the world is that land@@ s@@ cape after land@@ s@@ cape after land@@ s@@ cape have been c@@ lear@@ ed and alter@@ ed for grow@@ ing food and other cro@@ ps ."
"So one of the questions we &apos;ve been as@@ king is , how much of the world is used to gro@@ w food , and where is it exactly , and how can we change that into the future , and what does it mean ?"
"Well , our team has been looking at this on a global scale , using s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te data and gro@@ un@@ d-@@ based data kind of to tr@@ ack far@@ ming on a global scale ."
"And this is what we found , and it &apos;s star@@ t@@ ling ."
This ma@@ p shows the pre@@ sen@@ ce of agri@@ culture on planet Earth .
"The green are@@ as are the are@@ as we use to gro@@ w cro@@ ps , like whe@@ at or so@@ y@@ be@@ ans or cor@@ n or ri@@ ce or whatever ."
That &apos;s 16 million squ@@ are kilome@@ ters &apos; wor@@ th of land .
"If you put it all together in one place , it &apos;d be the size of S@@ outh America ."
"The second area , in b@@ row@@ n , is the world &apos;s pa@@ stu@@ res and r@@ ang@@ el@@ ands , where our animals live ."
"That area &apos;s about 30 million squ@@ are kilome@@ ters , or about an Africa &apos;s wor@@ th of land , a huge amount of land , and it &apos;s the best land , of course , is what you see . And what &apos;s left is , like , the mi@@ ddle of the S@@ a@@ har@@ a D@@ es@@ er@@ t , or S@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ a , or the mi@@ ddle of a ra@@ in fore@@ st ."
We &apos;re using a planet &apos;s wor@@ th of land already .
"If we look at this car@@ e@@ fully , we find it &apos;s about 40 percent of the Earth &apos;s land surface is de@@ v@@ ot@@ ed to agri@@ culture , and it &apos;s 60 times lar@@ ger than all the are@@ as we com@@ pla@@ in about , our su@@ bur@@ b@@ an spraw@@ l and our cities where we mo@@ st@@ ly live ."
"H@@ al@@ f of hum@@ ani@@ ty lives in cities today , but a 6@@ 0-@@ ti@@ m@@ es@@ -@@ lar@@ ger area is used to gro@@ w food ."
"So this is an amazing kind of resul@@ t , and it really sh@@ oc@@ ked us when we looked at that ."
"So we &apos;re using an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of land for agri@@ culture , but also we &apos;re using a lot of water ."
"This is a photogra@@ ph fl@@ ying into A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona , and when you look at it , you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; What are they grow@@ ing here ? &quot; &quot; It turns out they &apos;re grow@@ ing let@@ tu@@ ce in the mi@@ ddle of the des@@ er@@ t using water spra@@ yed on top ."
"Now , the i@@ ro@@ ny is , it &apos;s probably s@@ old in our super@@ market sh@@ el@@ ves in the T@@ wi@@ n C@@ it@@ ies ."
"But what &apos;s really interesting is , this water &apos;s got to come from some place , and it comes from here , the Col@@ or@@ a@@ do Ri@@ ver in Nor@@ th America ."
"Well , the Col@@ or@@ a@@ do on a ty@@ pi@@ cal day in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , this is just , you know , not a flo@@ od , not a d@@ rought , kind of an a@@ ver@@ age day , it looks something like this ."
"But if we come back today , during a nor@@ mal con@@ di@@ tion to the ex@@ act same lo@@ cation , this is what &apos;s left ."
"The difference is ma@@ in@@ ly ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ating the des@@ er@@ t for food , or maybe g@@ ol@@ f cour@@ ses in S@@ c@@ ot@@ t@@ s@@ d@@ ale , you take your pi@@ ck ."
"Well , this is a lot of water , and again , we &apos;re min@@ ing water and using it to gro@@ w food , and today , if you tra@@ vel down f@@ ur@@ ther down the Col@@ or@@ a@@ do , it d@@ r@@ ies up completely and no longer f@@ low@@ s into the ocean ."
We &apos;ve liter@@ ally con@@ sum@@ ed an entire ri@@ ver in Nor@@ th America for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .
"Well , that &apos;s not even the wor@@ st example in the world ."
This probably is : the A@@ ral Se@@ a .
"Now , a lot you will remember this from your ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y clas@@ ses ."
"This is in the form@@ er S@@ o@@ vie@@ t Uni@@ on in between K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ stan and U@@ z@@ be@@ k@@ ist@@ an , one of the great in@@ land se@@ as of the world ."
"But there &apos;s kind of a par@@ ad@@ o@@ x here , because it looks like it &apos;s sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by des@@ er@@ t . Why is this se@@ a here ?"
"The reason it &apos;s here is because , on the ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side , you see two little ri@@ ver@@ s kind of coming down through the s@@ and , fe@@ e@@ ding this basi@@ n with water ."
"Th@@ ose ri@@ ver@@ s are dra@@ ining s@@ now@@ me@@ l@@ t from m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins far to the e@@ ast , where s@@ now me@@ l@@ ts , it tra@@ v@@ els down the ri@@ ver through the des@@ er@@ t , and form@@ s the great A@@ ral Se@@ a ."
"Well , in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , the S@@ o@@ vie@@ ts decided to di@@ ver@@ t that water to ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ate the des@@ er@@ t to gro@@ w c@@ ot@@ ton , believe it or not , in K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ stan , to se@@ ll c@@ ot@@ ton to the inter@@ national marke@@ ts to bring fore@@ ig@@ n cur@@ ren@@ cy into the S@@ o@@ vie@@ t Uni@@ on ."
They really needed the money .
"Well , you can imagine what happens . You turn off the water su@@ pp@@ ly to the A@@ ral Se@@ a , what &apos;s going to happen ?"
"H@@ ere it is in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , 19@@ 8@@ 6 , 199@@ 9 , 200@@ 4 , and about 11 months ago ."
It &apos;s pretty ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary .
Now a lot of us in the audience here live in the Mi@@ dw@@ est .
I@@ mag@@ ine that was L@@ ake Su@@ per@@ i@@ or .
I@@ mag@@ ine that was L@@ ake H@@ u@@ ro@@ n .
It &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary change .
"This is not only a change in water and where the sho@@ rel@@ ine is , this is a change in the fundam@@ ent@@ als of the environment of this regi@@ on ."
Let &apos;s start with this .
The S@@ o@@ vie@@ t Uni@@ on didn &apos;t really have a S@@ ier@@ ra C@@ lub .
Let &apos;s put it that way .
So what you find in the bot@@ tom of the A@@ ral Se@@ a a@@ in &apos;t pretty .
"There &apos;s a lot of to@@ x@@ ic wa@@ ste , a lot of things that were du@@ m@@ ped there that are now be@@ coming air@@ bor@@ ne ."
One of those small is@@ l@@ ands that was re@@ mot@@ e and im@@ possible to get to was a site of S@@ o@@ vie@@ t biologi@@ cal we@@ apo@@ ns test@@ ing .
You can walk there today .
W@@ e@@ a@@ ther pat@@ ter@@ ns have changed .
N@@ in@@ e@@ te@@ en of the uni@@ qu@@ e 20 fish species found only in the A@@ ral Se@@ a are now wi@@ ped off the face of the Earth .
This is an environ@@ ment@@ al disa@@ ster w@@ r@@ it large .
But let &apos;s bring it home .
"This is a picture that A@@ l G@@ ore gave me a few years ago that he took when he was in the S@@ o@@ vie@@ t Uni@@ on a long , long time ago , show@@ ing the fi@@ sh@@ ing f@@ le@@ ets of the A@@ ral Se@@ a ."
You see the can@@ al they du@@ g ?
"They were so des@@ per@@ ate to try to , kind of , flo@@ at the bo@@ ats into the re@@ ma@@ ining po@@ ols of water , but they finally had to give up because the pier@@ s and the mo@@ or@@ ings simply couldn &apos;t keep up with the re@@ tre@@ ating sho@@ rel@@ ine ."
"I don &apos;t know about you , but I &apos;m terri@@ f@@ ied that future ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ologi@@ sts will di@@ g this up and write stories about our time in history , and won@@ der , &quot; &quot; What were you thinking ? &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the future we have to look forward to ."
"We already use about 50 percent of the Earth &apos;s fre@@ sh water that &apos;s susta@@ in@@ able , and agri@@ culture alone is 70 percent of that ."
"So we use a lot of water , a lot of land for agri@@ culture ."
We also use a lot of the atmo@@ sp@@ here for agri@@ culture .
"U@@ su@@ ally when we think about the atmo@@ sp@@ here , we think about clim@@ ate change and gre@@ en@@ house g@@ ases , and mo@@ st@@ ly around energy , but it turns out agri@@ culture is one of the bi@@ ggest e@@ mi@@ t@@ ters of gre@@ en@@ house g@@ ases too ."
"If you look at car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de from bur@@ ning tro@@ pi@@ cal ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st , or meth@@ ane coming from c@@ ow@@ s and ri@@ ce , or ni@@ t@@ rou@@ s o@@ x@@ i@@ de from too many fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , it turns out agri@@ culture is 30 percent of the gre@@ en@@ house g@@ ases going into the atmo@@ sp@@ here from human acti@@ vity ."
That &apos;s more than all our transpor@@ tation .
It &apos;s more than all our electri@@ city .
"It &apos;s more than all other man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , in fact ."
It &apos;s the single largest e@@ mi@@ t@@ ter of gre@@ en@@ house g@@ ases of any human acti@@ vity in the world .
"And yet , we don &apos;t talk about it very much ."
"So we have this incredible pre@@ sen@@ ce today of agri@@ culture dom@@ in@@ ating our planet , whether it &apos;s 40 percent of our land surface , 70 percent of the water we use , 30 percent of our gre@@ en@@ house gas e@@ mis@@ sions ."
"We &apos;ve d@@ ou@@ b@@ led the f@@ low@@ s of ni@@ tro@@ g@@ en and ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us around the world simply by using fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , ca@@ using huge problems of water qu@@ ality from ri@@ ver@@ s , l@@ ak@@ es , and even oce@@ ans , and it &apos;s also the single bi@@ ggest dri@@ ver of bi@@ od@@ i@@ versity lo@@ ss ."
"So without a d@@ ou@@ b@@ t , agri@@ culture is the single most powerful force un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed on this planet since the end of the ice age . No question ."
And it ri@@ v@@ als clim@@ ate change in import@@ ance .
And they &apos;re both happening at the same time .
But what &apos;s really important here to remember is that it &apos;s not all bad . It &apos;s not that agri@@ culture &apos;s a bad thing .
"In fact , we completely de@@ p@@ end on it ."
It &apos;s not op@@ ti@@ onal . It &apos;s not a lu@@ x@@ ury . It &apos;s an absolu@@ te ne@@ ces@@ sity .
"We have to provi@@ de food and fe@@ ed and , ye@@ ah , fi@@ ber and even bio@@ fu@@ els to something like seven billion people in the world today , and if anything , we &apos;re going to have the de@@ man@@ ds on agri@@ culture incre@@ ase into the future . It &apos;s not going to go away ."
"It &apos;s going to get a lot bi@@ g@@ ger , ma@@ in@@ ly because of grow@@ ing popul@@ ation . We &apos;re seven billion people today he@@ ading towar@@ ds at least n@@ ine , probably n@@ ine and a half before we &apos;re done ."
"M@@ ore import@@ an@@ tly , chang@@ ing d@@ ie@@ ts ."
"As the world be@@ comes we@@ al@@ th@@ ier as well as more popul@@ ous , we &apos;re seeing incre@@ ases in d@@ ie@@ t@@ ary con@@ sum@@ ption of me@@ at , which take a lot more re@@ sources than a ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ari@@ an d@@ ie@@ t does ."
"So more people , e@@ ating more stuff , and ri@@ ch@@ er stuff , and of course having an energy cri@@ sis at the same time , where we have to re@@ place oil with other energy sources that will ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely have to inclu@@ de some kinds of bio@@ fu@@ els and bio@@ -@@ energy sources ."
So you put these together . It &apos;s really hard to see how we &apos;re going to get to the rest of the century without at least d@@ ou@@ b@@ ling global agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral produ@@ ction .
"Well , how are we going to do this ? How are going to d@@ ou@@ ble global a@@ g produ@@ ction around the world ?"
"Well , we could try to far@@ m more land ."
"This is an an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s we &apos;ve done , where on the left is where the cro@@ ps are today , on the right is where they could be based on so@@ il@@ s and clim@@ ate , as@@ sum@@ ing clim@@ ate change doesn &apos;t dis@@ ru@@ pt too much of this , which is not a good as@@ sum@@ ption ."
"We could far@@ m more land , but the problem is the re@@ ma@@ ining l@@ ands are in sen@@ si@@ tive are@@ as ."
"They have a lot of bi@@ od@@ i@@ versity , a lot of car@@ b@@ on , things we want to prote@@ ct ."
"So we could gro@@ w more food by ex@@ pan@@ ding farm@@ land , but we &apos;d better not , because it &apos;s e@@ co@@ logi@@ cally a very , very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous thing to do ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , we maybe want to fre@@ e@@ ze the fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int of agri@@ culture and far@@ m the l@@ ands we have better ."
This is work that we &apos;re doing to try to high@@ light places in the world where we could impro@@ ve y@@ ie@@ l@@ ds without har@@ ming the environment .
"The green are@@ as here show where cor@@ n y@@ ie@@ l@@ ds , just show@@ ing cor@@ n as an example , are already really high , probably the ma@@ x@@ i@@ mu@@ m you could find on Earth today for that clim@@ ate and so@@ il , but the b@@ row@@ n are@@ as and y@@ el@@ low are@@ as are places where we &apos;re only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the y@@ ie@@ ld you should be able to get ."
"You see a lot of this in Africa , even L@@ at@@ in America , but interest@@ ing@@ ly , E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Europ@@ e , where S@@ o@@ vie@@ t Uni@@ on and E@@ ast@@ er@@ n B@@ lo@@ c countries used to be , is still a m@@ ess agri@@ cul@@ tur@@ ally ."
"Now , this would requi@@ re nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ ts and water ."
It &apos;s going to either be organi@@ c or con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal or some mi@@ x of the two to deli@@ ver that .
P@@ lan@@ ts need water and nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ ts .
"But we can do this , and there are opportuni@@ ties to make this work ."
But we have to do it in a way that is sen@@ si@@ tive to me@@ e@@ ting the food secu@@ ri@@ ty needs of the future and the environ@@ ment@@ al secu@@ ri@@ ty needs of the future .
We have to figure out how to make this tra@@ de@@ off between grow@@ ing food and having a health@@ y environment work better .
"R@@ ight now , it &apos;s kind of an al@@ l-@@ or@@ -@@ nothing pro@@ posi@@ tion ."
"We can gro@@ w food in the back@@ ground — that &apos;s a so@@ y@@ be@@ an fie@@ ld — and in this f@@ low@@ er di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m , it shows we gro@@ w a lot of food , but we don &apos;t have a lot cle@@ an water , we &apos;re not stor@@ ing a lot of car@@ b@@ on , we don &apos;t have a lot of bi@@ od@@ i@@ versity ."
"In the fore@@ ground , we have this pra@@ ir@@ ie that &apos;s wonderful from the environ@@ ment@@ al side , but you can &apos;t e@@ at anything . What &apos;s there to e@@ at ?"
We need to figure out how to bring both of those together into a new kind of agri@@ culture that br@@ ings them all together .
"Now , when I talk about this , people often tell me , &quot; &quot; Well , isn &apos;t bl@@ ank the answer ? &quot; &quot; — organi@@ c food , local food , G@@ M@@ O@@ s , new tra@@ de sub@@ si@@ d@@ ies , new far@@ m bi@@ l@@ ls — and ye@@ ah , we have a lot of good ideas here , but not any one of these is a sil@@ ver bu@@ l@@ let ."
"In fact , what I think they are is more like sil@@ ver bu@@ ck@@ sh@@ ot ."
"And I love sil@@ ver bu@@ ck@@ sh@@ ot . You put it together and you &apos;ve got something really powerful , but we need to put them together ."
"So what we have to do , I think , is inv@@ ent a new kind of agri@@ culture that b@@ len@@ ds the best ideas of comm@@ er@@ cial agri@@ culture and the green re@@ v@@ olution with the best ideas of organi@@ c far@@ ming and local food and the best ideas of environ@@ ment@@ al con@@ ser@@ vation , not to have them fi@@ gh@@ ting each other but to have them col@@ labor@@ ating together to form a new kind of agri@@ culture , something I call &quot; &quot; ter@@ rac@@ ul@@ ture , &quot; &quot; or far@@ ming for a whole planet ."
"Now , having this convers@@ ation has been really hard , and we &apos;ve been trying very hard to bring these key poin@@ ts to people to redu@@ ce the contro@@ vers@@ y , to incre@@ ase the col@@ labor@@ ation ."
I want to show you a shor@@ t video that does kind of show our ef@@ for@@ ts right now to bring these si@@ des together into a single convers@@ ation . So let me show you that .
"( Music ) ( &quot; &quot; In@@ stitu@@ te on the En@@ viron@@ ment , Uni@@ versity of M@@ in@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a : D@@ ri@@ ven to D@@ is@@ co@@ ver &quot; &quot; ) ( Music ) ( &quot; &quot; The world popul@@ ation is grow@@ ing by 7@@ 5 million people each year ."
That &apos;s almost the size of G@@ er@@ many .
"T@@ od@@ ay , we &apos;re ne@@ aring 7 billion people ."
"A@@ t this r@@ ate , we &apos;ll re@@ ach 9 billion people by 20@@ 40 ."
And we all need food .
But how ?
How do we fe@@ ed a grow@@ ing world without de@@ stro@@ ying the planet ?
We already know clim@@ ate change is a big problem .
But it &apos;s not the only problem .
We need to face &apos; the other in@@ con@@ ven@@ ien@@ t tru@@ th . &apos; A global cri@@ sis in agri@@ culture .
P@@ op@@ ul@@ ation grow@@ th + me@@ at con@@ sum@@ ption + da@@ i@@ ry con@@ sum@@ ption + energy co@@ sts + bio@@ energy produ@@ ction = stre@@ ss on natural re@@ sources .
M@@ ore than 40 % of Earth &apos;s land has been c@@ lear@@ ed for agri@@ culture .
G@@ lob@@ al cro@@ plan@@ ds co@@ ver 16 million km ² .
That &apos;s almost the size of S@@ outh America .
G@@ lob@@ al pa@@ stu@@ res co@@ ver 30 million km ² .
That &apos;s the size of Africa .
A@@ g@@ ri@@ culture uses 60 times more land than urb@@ an and su@@ bur@@ b@@ an are@@ as com@@ b@@ ined .
I@@ r@@ ri@@ g@@ ation is the bi@@ ggest use of water on the planet .
"We use 2@@ ,@@ 8@@ 00 cu@@ bi@@ c kilome@@ ters of water on cro@@ ps every year ."
"That &apos;s enough to fi@@ ll 7@@ ,@@ 3@@ 0@@ 5 E@@ m@@ pi@@ re St@@ ate Bu@@ il@@ dings every day ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , many large ri@@ ver@@ s have redu@@ ced f@@ low@@ s ."
S@@ ome d@@ ry up al@@ together .
"L@@ ook at the A@@ ral Se@@ a , now turned to des@@ er@@ t ."
"O@@ r the Col@@ or@@ a@@ do Ri@@ ver , which no longer f@@ low@@ s to the ocean ."
F@@ er@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers have more than d@@ ou@@ b@@ led the ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us and ni@@ tro@@ g@@ en in the environment .
The con@@ sequ@@ ence ?
Wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad water pol@@ lu@@ tion and mas@@ sive de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation of l@@ ak@@ es and ri@@ ver@@ s .
"S@@ ur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly , agri@@ culture is the bi@@ ggest con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tor to clim@@ ate change ."
It gener@@ ates 30 % of gre@@ en@@ house gas e@@ mis@@ sions .
"That &apos;s more than the e@@ mis@@ sions from all electri@@ city and indu@@ stry , or from all the world &apos;s plan@@ es , tra@@ ins and au@@ tom@@ ob@@ i@@ les ."
"Mo@@ st agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral e@@ mis@@ sions come from tro@@ pi@@ cal de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation , meth@@ ane from animals and ri@@ ce fie@@ l@@ ds , and ni@@ t@@ rou@@ s o@@ x@@ i@@ de from over@@ -@@ fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ing ."
There is nothing we do that trans@@ form@@ s the world more than agri@@ culture .
And there &apos;s nothing we do that is more c@@ ru@@ cial to our survi@@ v@@ al .
Here &apos;s the di@@ le@@ m@@ ma ...
"As the world grow@@ s by se@@ ver@@ al billion more people , We &apos;ll need to d@@ ou@@ ble , maybe even tri@@ ple , global food produ@@ ction ."
So where do we go from here ?
"We need a bi@@ g@@ ger convers@@ ation , an inter@@ national di@@ al@@ og@@ ue ."
"We need to inv@@ est in real solu@@ tions : in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves for farm@@ ers , pre@@ ci@@ sion agri@@ culture , new cro@@ p v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties , dri@@ p ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , gra@@ y water re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling , better ti@@ ll@@ age prac@@ ti@@ ces , s@@ mar@@ ter d@@ ie@@ ts ."
We need everyone at the table .
"A@@ d@@ v@@ oc@@ ates of comm@@ er@@ cial agri@@ culture , environ@@ ment@@ al con@@ ser@@ vation , and organi@@ c far@@ ming ..."
must work together .
There is no single solution .
"We need col@@ labor@@ ation , imag@@ in@@ ation , de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation , because fai@@ lu@@ re is not an op@@ tion ."
How do we fe@@ ed the world without de@@ stro@@ ying it ?
"@@ Yeah , so we face one of the gre@@ at@@ est gr@@ and challen@@ ges in all of human history today : the need to fe@@ ed n@@ ine billion people and do so susta@@ in@@ ably and equ@@ it@@ ably and ju@@ st@@ ly , at the same time prote@@ cting our planet for this and future gener@@ ations ."
"This is going to be one of the har@@ d@@ est things we ever have done in human history , and we absolu@@ tely have to get it right , and we have to get it right on our first and only try ."
So th@@ an@@ ks very much . ( Applause )
"So , my question : are we alone ?"
"The story of hum@@ ans is the story of ideas — scienti@@ fic ideas that sh@@ ine light into dar@@ k cor@@ n@@ ers , ideas that we em@@ brac@@ e r@@ ati@@ on@@ ally and ir@@ r@@ ati@@ on@@ ally , ideas for which we &apos;ve li@@ ved and d@@ ied and kil@@ led and been kil@@ led , ideas that have v@@ ani@@ shed in history , and ideas that have been set in do@@ g@@ ma ."
"It &apos;s a story of n@@ ations , of ide@@ o@@ log@@ ies , of terri@@ tor@@ ies , and of con@@ fli@@ cts am@@ ong them ."
"But , every moment of human history , from the St@@ one A@@ ge to the In@@ form@@ ation A@@ ge , from S@@ um@@ er and B@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on to the i@@ P@@ od and ce@@ le@@ bri@@ ty go@@ s@@ si@@ p , they &apos;ve all been car@@ ried out — every book that you &apos;ve read , every po@@ em , every l@@ au@@ gh , every te@@ ar — they &apos;ve all happened here ."

These extre@@ mo@@ phi@@ les tell us that life may exi@@ st in many other environ@@ ments .

"E@@ ven our ne@@ ar@@ est st@@ ar , the Su@@ n — its e@@ mis@@ sions su@@ f@@ f@@ er the ty@@ ran@@ ny of light speed ."

"And the ed@@ ge of our gal@@ ax@@ y is 7@@ 5@@ ,000 light years away , and the ne@@ ar@@ est gal@@ ax@@ y to us , 2@@ .@@ 5 million light years ."
That means any sig@@ na@@ l we de@@ te@@ ct would have started its jour@@ ney a long time ago .

"Wh@@ ich is why P@@ hi@@ l M@@ or@@ ri@@ son cal@@ ls S@@ E@@ T@@ I , &quot; &quot; the ar@@ cha@@ e@@ o@@ logy of the future . &quot; &quot; It tel@@ ls us about their past , but de@@ te@@ ction of a sig@@ na@@ l tel@@ ls us it &apos;s possible for us to have a long future ."
"I think this is what Davi@@ d De@@ ut@@ s@@ ch me@@ ant in 200@@ 5 , when he en@@ ded his O@@ x@@ for@@ d TE@@ D@@ T@@ al@@ k by saying he had two prin@@ ci@@ ples he &apos;d like to share for living , and he would like to car@@ ve them on st@@ one tab@@ le@@ ts ."
The first is that problems are in@@ evi@@ table .
The second is that problems are solu@@ ble .
"So , ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely what &apos;s going to de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine the suc@@ cess or fai@@ lu@@ re of S@@ E@@ T@@ I is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of technolog@@ ies , and the mean di@@ stance between technolog@@ ies in the co@@ smo@@ s — di@@ stance over space and di@@ stance over time ."

"And we &apos;re a very young technology in an old gal@@ ax@@ y , and we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s possible for technolog@@ ies to per@@ si@@ st ."
"So , up until now I &apos;ve been talking to you about really large num@@ bers ."
Let me talk about a relati@@ vely small number .
And that &apos;s the len@@ g@@ th of time that the Earth was li@@ fel@@ ess .
"Z@@ ir@@ con@@ s that are min@@ ed in the J@@ ack H@@ il@@ ls of we@@ ster@@ n Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , z@@ ir@@ con@@ s taken from the J@@ ack H@@ il@@ ls of we@@ ster@@ n Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a tell us that within a few hundre@@ d million years of the ori@@ g@@ in of the planet there was ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant water and per@@ haps even life ."
"So , our planet has spent the v@@ ast maj@@ ori@@ ty of its 4@@ .@@ 5@@ 6 billion year history develo@@ ping life , not anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ing its em@@ er@@ g@@ ence ."
"L@@ i@@ fe happened very quickly , and that bo@@ des well for the poten@@ tial of life el@@ se@@ where in the co@@ smo@@ s ."
And the other thing that one should take away from this char@@ t is the very nar@@ row r@@ ange of time over which hum@@ ans can c@@ la@@ im to be the dom@@ in@@ ant inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence on the planet .
It &apos;s only the last few hundre@@ d thous@@ and years moder@@ n hum@@ ans have been pur@@ su@@ ing technology and ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation .

We are not the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of ev@@ olution .
We are not the de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed produ@@ ct of bi@@ llions of years of ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary pl@@ ot@@ ting and plan@@ ning .
We are one out@@ come of a contin@@ u@@ ing ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ational process .

"We mis@@ use language , and talk about the &quot; &quot; as@@ cent &quot; &quot; of man ."
We understand the scienti@@ fic basi@@ s for the inter@@ re@@ lat@@ ed@@ ness of life but our ego ha@@ sn &apos;t ca@@ u@@ ght up yet .
"So this &quot; &quot; as@@ cent &quot; &quot; of man , p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of ev@@ olution , has got to go ."
It &apos;s a sense of pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge that the natural universe doesn &apos;t share .
"L@@ ore@@ n E@@ i@@ se@@ ley has said , &quot; &quot; One does not me@@ et on@@ es@@ el@@ f until one cat@@ ch@@ es the ref@@ le@@ ction from an ey@@ e other than human . &quot; &quot; One day that ey@@ e may be that of an inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent al@@ ie@@ n , and the so@@ on@@ er we es@@ che@@ w our nar@@ row view of ev@@ olution the so@@ on@@ er we can tru@@ ly expl@@ ore our ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate ori@@ gin@@ s and de@@ st@@ in@@ ations ."
"We are a small part of the story of co@@ smi@@ c ev@@ olution , and we are going to be respon@@ si@@ ble for our contin@@ u@@ ed parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation in that story , and per@@ haps S@@ E@@ T@@ I will help as well ."

Thank you .
( Applause )
The problem that I want to talk with you about is really the problem of : How does one su@@ pp@@ ly health@@ care in a world in which cost is everything ?
How do you do that ?
"And the basi@@ c par@@ ad@@ ig@@ m we want to su@@ ggest to you , I want to su@@ ggest to you , is one in which you say that in order to tre@@ at dise@@ ase you have to first know what you &apos;re tre@@ ating — that &apos;s di@@ ag@@ no@@ sti@@ cs — and then you have to do something ."
"So , the program that we &apos;re inv@@ olved in is something which we call D@@ i@@ ag@@ no@@ sti@@ cs for All , or zer@@ o@@ -@@ cost di@@ ag@@ no@@ sti@@ cs ."
How do you provi@@ de medi@@ cally rele@@ v@@ ant information at as close as possible to zer@@ o cost ? How do you do it ?
Let me just give you two exam@@ ples .
"The ri@@ g@@ ors of mi@@ lit@@ ary medi@@ cine are not so dis@@ si@@ mi@@ lar from the third world — po@@ or re@@ sources , a ri@@ go@@ rou@@ s environment , a ser@@ ies of problems in li@@ gh@@ t@@ we@@ ight , and things of this kind — and also not so different from the home health@@ care and di@@ ag@@ no@@ stic system world ."
"So , the technology that I want to talk about is for the third world , for the develo@@ ping world , but it has , I think , much bro@@ a@@ der app@@ lic@@ ation , because information is so important in the health@@ care system ."
"So , you see two exam@@ ples here ."
One is a la@@ b that is actually a fa@@ ir@@ ly high-@@ end labor@@ at@@ ory in Africa .
The second is basically an ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur who is set up and doing wh@@ o@@ -@@ know@@ s@@ -@@ what in a table in a market .
I don &apos;t know what kind of health@@ care is deli@@ vered there .
But it &apos;s not really what is probably most ef@@ fi@@ cient .
What is our appro@@ ach ?
"And the way in which one ty@@ pi@@ cally appro@@ ach@@ es a problem of low@@ ering cost , star@@ ting from the perspe@@ ctive of the United States , is to take our solution , and then to try to cut cost out of it ."
"No matter how you do that , you &apos;re not going to start with a 10@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ dol@@ lar instru@@ ment and bring it down to no@@ -@@ cost . It isn &apos;t going to work ."
"So , the appro@@ ach that we took was the other way around ."
"To ask , &quot; &quot; What is the che@@ ap@@ est possible stuff that you could make a di@@ ag@@ no@@ stic system out of , and get us@@ e@@ ful information , ad@@ d fun@@ ction ? &quot; &quot; And what we &apos;ve cho@@ s@@ en is pa@@ per ."
What you see here is a pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pi@@ c de@@ vice .
It &apos;s about a cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter on the side .
It &apos;s about the size of a fin@@ ger@@ na@@ il .
The lin@@ es around the ed@@ ges are a po@@ ly@@ m@@ er .
"It &apos;s made of pa@@ per and pa@@ per , of course , wi@@ cks flu@@ id , as you know , pa@@ per , c@@ lot@@ h — dro@@ p w@@ ine on the tab@@ le@@ c@@ lot@@ h , and the w@@ ine wi@@ cks all over everything ."
"P@@ u@@ t it on your sh@@ ir@@ t , it ru@@ ins the sh@@ ir@@ t ."
That &apos;s what a hy@@ dro@@ phi@@ li@@ c surface does .
"So , in this de@@ vice the idea is that you dri@@ p the bot@@ tom end of it in a dro@@ p of , in this case , ur@@ ine ."
The flu@@ id wi@@ cks its way into those ch@@ am@@ bers at the top .
"The b@@ row@@ n color indi@@ c@@ ates the amount of g@@ lu@@ co@@ se in the ur@@ ine , the blue color indi@@ c@@ ates the amount of prote@@ in in the ur@@ ine ."
And the com@@ bin@@ ation of those two is a first order sh@@ ot at a number of us@@ e@@ ful things that you want .
"So , this is an example of a de@@ vice made from a simple piece of pa@@ per ."
"Now , how simple can you make the produ@@ ction ?"
Why do we cho@@ ose pa@@ per ?
"There &apos;s an example of the same thing on a fin@@ ger , show@@ ing you basically what it looks like ."
One reason for using pa@@ per is that it &apos;s every@@ where .
"We have made these kinds of de@@ vi@@ ces using na@@ p@@ k@@ ins and to@@ i@@ let pa@@ per and w@@ ra@@ ps , and all kinds of stuff ."
"So , the produ@@ ction cap@@ ability is there ."
"The second is , you can put lots and lots of te@@ sts in a very small place ."
"I &apos;ll show you in a moment that the st@@ ack of pa@@ per there would probably h@@ old something like 10@@ 0,000 te@@ sts , something of that kind ."
"And then finally , a point that you don &apos;t think of so much in develo@@ ped world medi@@ cine : it e@@ li@@ min@@ ates sh@@ ar@@ ps ."
"And what sh@@ ar@@ ps means is need@@ les , things that sti@@ ck ."
"If you &apos;ve taken a sam@@ ple of someone &apos;s blo@@ od and the someone might have he@@ p@@ ati@@ t@@ is C , you don &apos;t want to make a mist@@ ake and sti@@ ck it in you ."
It just — you don &apos;t want to do that .
"So , how do you di@@ spos@@ e of that ? It &apos;s a problem every@@ where ."
And here you simply bur@@ n it .
"So , it &apos;s a sort of a prac@@ tical appro@@ ach to star@@ ting on things ."
"Now , you say , &quot; &quot; If pa@@ per is a good idea , other people have su@@ re@@ ly thought of it . &quot; &quot; And the answer is , of course , y@@ es ."
"Th@@ ose half of you , rou@@ gh@@ ly , who are women , at some point may have had a pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy test ."
And the most common of these is in a de@@ vice that looks like the thing on the left .
It &apos;s something called a lat@@ er@@ al f@@ low im@@ mu@@ no@@ as@@ say .
"In that particular test , ur@@ ine either , con@@ ta@@ ining a hor@@ m@@ one called H@@ C@@ G , does or does not f@@ low across a piece of pa@@ per ."
"And there are two bar@@ s . One b@@ ar indi@@ c@@ ates that the test is working , and if the second b@@ ar shows up , you &apos;re pre@@ gn@@ ant ."
"This is a terri@@ fic kind of test in a bin@@ ary world , and the nice thing about pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy is either you are pre@@ gn@@ ant or you &apos;re not pre@@ gn@@ ant ."
You &apos;re not parti@@ ally pre@@ gn@@ ant or thinking about being pre@@ gn@@ ant or something of that sort .
"So , it works very well there , but it doesn &apos;t work very well when you need more qu@@ anti@@ t@@ ative information ."
"There are also di@@ p@@ sti@@ cks , but if you look at the di@@ p@@ sti@@ cks , they &apos;re for another kind of ur@@ ine an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s ."
There are an aw@@ ful lot of col@@ ors and things like that .
What do you actually do about that in a difficult cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stance ?
"So , the appro@@ ach that we started with is to ask : Is it really prac@@ tical to make things of this sort ?"
"And that problem is now , in a pu@@ re@@ ly engine@@ ering way , sol@@ ved ."
And the pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re that we have is simply to start with pa@@ per .
You run it through a new kind of prin@@ ter called a wa@@ x prin@@ ter .
The wa@@ x prin@@ ter does what looks like prin@@ ting .
"It is prin@@ ting . You put that on , you war@@ m it a little bit , the wa@@ x prin@@ ts through so it ab@@ sor@@ b@@ s into the pa@@ per , and you end up with the de@@ vice that you want ."
The pr@@ inter@@ s cost 8@@ 00 bu@@ cks now .
"They &apos;ll make , we est@@ im@@ ate that if you were to run them 2@@ 4 hours a day they &apos;d make about 10 million te@@ sts a year ."
"So , it &apos;s a sol@@ ved problem , that particular problem is sol@@ ved ."
And there is an example of the kind of thing that you see .
That &apos;s on a piece of 8 by 12 pa@@ per .
That takes about two secon@@ ds to make .
And so I re@@ g@@ ard that as done .
"There is a very important issue here , which is that because it &apos;s a prin@@ ter , a color prin@@ ter , it prin@@ ts col@@ ors . That &apos;s what color pr@@ inter@@ s do ."
"I &apos;ll show you in a moment , that &apos;s actually quite us@@ e@@ ful ."
"Now , the next question that you would like to ask is : What would you like to meas@@ ure ? What would you like to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze ?"
"And the thing which you &apos;d most like to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze , we &apos;re a fa@@ ir di@@ stance from ."
"It &apos;s what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; fe@@ ver of un@@ di@@ ag@@ no@@ sed ori@@ g@@ in . &quot; &quot; S@@ ome@@ one comes into the c@@ lin@@ ic , they have a fe@@ ver , they feel bad . What do they have ?"
Do they have T@@ .@@ B@@ . ? Do they have AIDS ?
Do they have a common c@@ old ?
The tri@@ age problem . That &apos;s a hard problem for reas@@ ons that I won &apos;t go through .
There are an aw@@ ful lot of things that you &apos;d like to di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ h am@@ ong .
"But then there are a ser@@ ies of things : AIDS , he@@ p@@ ati@@ t@@ is , mal@@ ar@@ ia , T@@ B , others and sim@@ ple@@ r ones , such as gu@@ i@@ dance of tre@@ at@@ ment ."
Now even that &apos;s more comp@@ lic@@ ated than you think .
"A friend of m@@ ine works in trans@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry , and he is interested in the question of why people do and don &apos;t take their me@@ ds ."
"So , D@@ ap@@ s@@ one , or something like that , you have to take it for a while ."
"He has a wonderful story of talking to a vi@@ ll@@ ag@@ er in Indi@@ a and saying , &quot; &quot; Ha@@ ve you taken your D@@ ap@@ s@@ one ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; Ha@@ ve you taken it every day ? &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;"
&quot; Ha@@ ve you taken if for a mon@@ th ? &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
"What the guy actually me@@ ant was that he &apos;d f@@ ed a 3@@ 0-@@ day do@@ se of D@@ ap@@ s@@ one to his do@@ g , that morning ."
"( Laughter ) He was tel@@ ling the tru@@ th . Because in a different culture , the do@@ g is a sur@@ ro@@ g@@ ate for you , you know , &quot; &quot; today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this mon@@ th , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the ra@@ iny se@@ as@@ on &quot; &quot; — there are lots of opportuni@@ ties for mi@@ su@@ n@@ der@@ standing , and so an issue here is to , in some c@@ ases , to figure out how to deal with mat@@ ters that se@@ em un@@ interesting , like comp@@ li@@ ance ."
"Now , take a look at what a ty@@ pi@@ cal test looks like ."
"P@@ ri@@ ck a fin@@ ger , you get some blo@@ od , about 50 micro@@ li@@ ters ."
"That &apos;s about all you &apos;re going to get , because you can &apos;t use the usu@@ al sort of systems ."
"You can &apos;t m@@ ani@@ pul@@ ate it very well , al@@ though I &apos;ll show something about that in a moment ."
"So , you take the dro@@ p of blo@@ od , no f@@ ur@@ ther m@@ ani@@ pul@@ ations , you put it on a little de@@ vice , the de@@ vice fil@@ ters out the blo@@ od cells , le@@ ts the ser@@ um go through , and you get a ser@@ ies of col@@ ors down in the bot@@ tom there ."
"And the col@@ ors indi@@ cate &quot; &quot; dise@@ ase &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; nor@@ mal . &quot; &quot; But even that &apos;s comp@@ lic@@ ated , because to you , to me , col@@ ors might indi@@ cate &quot; &quot; nor@@ mal , &quot; &quot; but , after all , we &apos;re all su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing from probably an ex@@ cess of education ."
What you do about something which requi@@ res qu@@ anti@@ t@@ ative an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s ?
"And so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there , and at this point there is a dra@@ m@@ atic fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh , and out comes the uni@@ vers@@ al solution to everything these days , which is a cell phone . In this particular case , a cam@@ era phone ."
"They &apos;re every@@ where , six billion a mon@@ th in Indi@@ a ."
"And the idea is that what one does , is to take the de@@ vice , you di@@ p it , you develo@@ p the color , you take a picture , the picture goes to a cent@@ ral labor@@ at@@ ory ."
"You don &apos;t have to sen@@ d out a do@@ ctor , you sen@@ d out somebody who can just take the sam@@ ple , and in the c@@ lin@@ ic either a do@@ ctor , or ide@@ ally a computer in this case , does the an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s ."
"T@@ ur@@ ns out to work actually quite well , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly when your color prin@@ ter has prin@@ ted the color bar@@ s that indi@@ cate how things work ."
"So , my view of the health care wor@@ k@@ er of the future is not a do@@ ctor , but is an 1@@ 8@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ yed , who has two things : He has a back@@ p@@ ack full of these te@@ sts , and a lan@@ c@@ et to oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally take a blo@@ od sam@@ ple , and an A@@ K@@ -@@ 4@@ 7 ."
And these are the things that get him through his day .
"There &apos;s another very interesting conne@@ ction here , and that is that what one wan@@ ts to do is to pas@@ s through us@@ e@@ ful information over what is gener@@ ally a pretty aw@@ ful tele@@ phone system ."
"It turns out there &apos;s an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of information already available on that sub@@ je@@ ct , which is the Mars ro@@ ver problem ."
How do you get back an ac@@ cur@@ ate view of the color on Mars if you have a really terri@@ ble b@@ and@@ wi@@ d@@ th to do it with ?
"And the answer is not comp@@ lic@@ ated but it &apos;s one which I don &apos;t want to go through here , other than to say that the communi@@ cation systems for doing this are really pretty well under@@ sto@@ od ."
"A@@ l@@ so , a fact which you may not know is that the compu@@ te cap@@ ability of this thing is not so different from the compu@@ te cap@@ ability of your des@@ kt@@ o@@ p computer ."
This is a fanta@@ stic de@@ vice which is only beginning to be ta@@ pped .
"I don &apos;t know whether the idea of one computer , one child makes any sense . Here &apos;s the computer of the future , because this scre@@ en is already there and they &apos;re u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
All right now let me show you just a little bit about adv@@ an@@ ced de@@ vi@@ ces .
And we &apos;ll start by pos@@ ing a little problem .
"What you see here is another cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ si@@ zed de@@ vice , and the different col@@ ors are different col@@ ors of dy@@ e ."
"And you noti@@ ce something which might stri@@ ke you as a little bit interesting , which is the y@@ el@@ low seem@@ s to disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar , get through the blue , and then get through the red ."
How does that happen ? How do you make something f@@ low through something ?
"And , of course the answer is , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; You make it f@@ low under and over ."
But now the question is : How do you make it f@@ low under and over in a piece of pa@@ per ?
"The answer is that what you do , and the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s are not terri@@ bly important here , is to make something more el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate : You take se@@ ver@@ al different la@@ y@@ ers of pa@@ per , each one con@@ ta@@ ining its own little flu@@ id system , and you se@@ par@@ ate them by pie@@ ces of , liter@@ ally , d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ si@@ ded car@@ pe@@ t ta@@ pe , the stuff you use to sti@@ ck the car@@ pe@@ ts on@@ to the flo@@ or ."
And the flu@@ id will f@@ low from one la@@ y@@ er into the next .
"It di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tes itself , f@@ low@@ s through f@@ ur@@ ther ho@@ les , di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tes itself ."
"And what you see , at the low@@ er ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side there , is a sam@@ ple in which a single sam@@ ple of blo@@ od has been put on the top , and it has gone through and di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted itself into these 16 ho@@ les on the bot@@ tom , in a piece of pa@@ per — basically it looks like a chi@@ p , two pie@@ ces of pa@@ per thi@@ ck ."
And in this particular case we were just interested in the re@@ p@@ lic@@ ability of that .
"But that is , in prin@@ ci@@ ple , the way you sol@@ ve the &quot; &quot; fe@@ ver of u@@ ne@@ x@@ pla@@ ined ori@@ g@@ in &quot; &quot; problem , because each one of those spo@@ ts then be@@ comes a test for a particular set of mark@@ ers of dise@@ ase , and this will work in du@@ e course ."
Here is an example of a sli@@ gh@@ tly more comp@@ lic@@ ated de@@ vice .
There &apos;s the chi@@ p .
You di@@ p in a cor@@ ner . The flu@@ id goes into the cen@@ ter .
"It di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tes itself out into these v@@ ari@@ ous wel@@ ls or ho@@ les , and turns color , and all done with pa@@ per and car@@ pe@@ t ta@@ pe ."
"So , I think it &apos;s as low@@ -@@ cost as we &apos;re li@@ ke@@ ly to be able to come up and make things ."
"Now , I have one last , two last little stories to tell you , in fini@@ sh@@ ing off this business ."
This is one : One of the things that one does oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally need to do is to se@@ par@@ ate blo@@ od cells from ser@@ um .
"And the question was , here we do it by taking a sam@@ ple , we put it in a cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , we sp@@ in it , and you get blo@@ od cells out . T@@ er@@ ri@@ fic ."
"What happens if you don &apos;t have an electri@@ city , and a cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and whatever ?"
"And we thought for a while of how you might do this and the way , in fact , you do it is what &apos;s sh@@ own here ."
"You get an e@@ gg@@ be@@ ater , which is every@@ where , and you saw off a bl@@ ade , and then you take tu@@ b@@ ing , and you sti@@ ck it on that . You put the blo@@ od in , you sp@@ in it — somebody si@@ ts there and sp@@ ins it ."
"It works really , really well ."
"And we s@@ at down , we did the physi@@ cs of e@@ gg@@ be@@ at@@ ers and self-@@ ali@@ g@@ ning tu@@ be@@ s and all the rest of that kind of thing , s@@ ent it off to a jour@@ na@@ l ."
"We were very pro@@ u@@ d of this , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly the ti@@ tle , which was &quot; &quot; E@@ gg@@ be@@ ater as C@@ ent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we s@@ ent it off , and by re@@ turn ma@@ il it came back ."
"I called up the e@@ di@@ tor and I said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? How is this possible ? &quot;"
"The e@@ di@@ tor said , with en@@ or@@ m@@ ous dis@@ da@@ in , &quot; &quot; I read this ."
"And we &apos;re not going to publi@@ sh it , because we only publi@@ sh science . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s an important issue because it means that we have to , as a society , think about what we val@@ ue ."
"And if it &apos;s just pa@@ per@@ s and ph@@ y@@ s. re@@ v@@ . let@@ ters , we &apos;ve got a problem ."
Here is another example of something which is — this is a little spe@@ c@@ tro@@ ph@@ ot@@ ome@@ ter .
"It meas@@ ures the ab@@ sor@@ ption of light in a sam@@ ple The ne@@ at thing about this is , you have light source that fli@@ ck@@ ers on and off at about 1@@ ,000 her@@ t@@ z , another light source that de@@ te@@ cts that light at 1@@ ,000 her@@ t@@ z , and so you can run this system in bro@@ ad da@@ y@@ light ."
"It perform@@ s about e@@ qui@@ val@@ ently to a system that &apos;s in the order of 10@@ 0,000 dollars ."
"It co@@ sts 50 dollars . We can probably make it for 50 c@@ ents , if we put our mind to it ."
"Wh@@ y doesn &apos;t somebody do it ? And the answer is , &quot; How do you make a prof@@ it in a ca@@ pit@@ ali@@ st system , doing that ? &quot;"
Inter@@ est@@ ing problem .
"So , let me fin@@ is@@ h by saying that we &apos;ve thought about this as a kind of engine@@ ering problem ."
And we &apos;ve asked : What is the scienti@@ fic uni@@ f@@ ying idea here ?
"And we &apos;ve decided that we should think about this not so much in terms of cost , but in terms of sim@@ pli@@ city ."
S@@ im@@ pli@@ city is a ne@@ at word . And you &apos;ve got to think about what sim@@ pli@@ city means .
I know what it is but I don &apos;t actually know what it means .
"So , I actually was interested enough in this to put together se@@ ver@@ al grou@@ ps of people ."
"And the most re@@ cent inv@@ olved a couple of people at M@@ I@@ T , one of them being an ex@@ cep@@ tion@@ ally b@@ right kid who is one of the very few people I would think of who &apos;s an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c g@@ eni@@ us ."
We all stru@@ gg@@ led for an entire day to think about sim@@ pli@@ city .
And I want to give you the answer of this de@@ ep scienti@@ fic thought .
"( Laughter ) So , in a sense , you get what you pay for ."
Thank you very much .
( Laughter )
"H@@ el@@ l@@ o . A@@ c@@ tually , that &apos;s &quot; &quot; hel@@ l@@ o &quot; &quot; in B@@ au@@ er B@@ od@@ oni for the ty@@ po@@ gra@@ phi@@ cally h@@ yst@@ eri@@ cal am@@ on@@ g@@ st us ."
"One of the thre@@ ads that seem@@ s to have come through l@@ ou@@ d and clear in the last couple of days is this need to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le what the Bi@@ g wan@@ ts — the &quot; &quot; Bi@@ g &quot; &quot; being the organiz@@ ation , the system , the country — and what the &quot; &quot; S@@ mall &quot; &quot; wan@@ ts — the individu@@ al , the person ."
And how do you bring those two things together ?
"Ch@@ ar@@ lie L@@ ed@@ better , y@@ est@@ er@@ day , I thought , tal@@ ked very arti@@ cu@@ lat@@ ely about this need to bring con@@ sum@@ ers , to bring people into the process of cre@@ ating things ."
And that &apos;s what I want to talk about today .
"So , br@@ ing@@ ing together the S@@ mall to help fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ate and create the Bi@@ g , I think , is something that we believe in — something I believe in , and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at I@@ deo ."
"I call this first ch@@ ap@@ ter — for the Bri@@ ts in the room — the &quot; &quot; B@@ lin@@ ding G@@ lim@@ p@@ se of the B@@ le@@ e@@ ding O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous . &quot; &quot; O@@ f@@ ten , the good ideas are so star@@ ing@@ -@@ at@@ -@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ in@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ face that you kind of mi@@ ss them . And I think , a lot of times , what we do is just , sort of , h@@ old the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r up to our cl@@ ien@@ ts , and sort of go , &quot; D@@ u@@ h ! You know , look what &apos;s really going on . &quot;"
"And rather than talk about it in the the@@ ory , I think I &apos;m just going to show you an example ."
We were asked by a large health@@ care system in M@@ in@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a to descri@@ be to them what their patien@@ t experience was .
"And I think they were expe@@ cting — they &apos;d worked with lots of con@@ sul@@ tan@@ ts before — I think they were expe@@ cting some kind of hi@@ de@@ ous or@@ g char@@ t with thousands of bu@@ b@@ b@@ les and syst@@ e@@ mi@@ c this , that and the other , and all kinds of ma@@ pp@@ y stuff ."
"O@@ r even wor@@ se , some kind of g@@ ha@@ st@@ ly de@@ a@@ th@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ Pow@@ er@@ point thing with W@@ ow@@ Ch@@ ar@@ ts and all kinds of , you know , God know@@ s , whatever ."
The first thing we actually sh@@ ared with them was this .
I &apos;ll play this until your e@@ ye@@ bal@@ ls completely dis@@ sol@@ ve .
This is 5@@ 9 secon@@ ds into the film .
This is a minu@@ te 5@@ 9 .
3 : 1@@ 9 .
I think something happens . I think a head may ap@@ pe@@ ar in a second .
5 : 10 .
5 : 5@@ 8 .
6 : 20 .
"We show@@ ed them the whole cut , and they were all completely , what is this ?"
"And the point is when you lie in a ho@@ spit@@ al bed all day , all you do is look at the ro@@ of , and it &apos;s a really sh@@ it@@ ty experience ."
"And just pu@@ tting yourself in the posi@@ tion of the patien@@ t — this is Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an , who works with us at I@@ deo ."
"He just l@@ ay in the ho@@ spit@@ al bed , and , kind of , star@@ ed at the pol@@ ysty@@ ren@@ e ce@@ il@@ ing ti@@ les for a really long time ."
That &apos;s what it &apos;s like to be a patien@@ t in the ho@@ spit@@ al .
"And they were sort , you know , b@@ lin@@ ding g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of b@@ le@@ e@@ ding obvi@@ ous ."
"O@@ h , my go@@ od@@ ness . So , looking at the situ@@ ation from the point of view of the person out — as op@@ posed to the tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal posi@@ tion of the organiz@@ ation in — was , for these guys , quite a re@@ v@@ el@@ ation ."
"And so , that was a really cat@@ al@@ y@@ tic thing for them ."
So they s@@ na@@ pped into action .
"They said , OK , it &apos;s not about syst@@ e@@ mi@@ c change ."
"It &apos;s not about huge , ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous things that we need to do ."
It &apos;s about t@@ iny things that can make a huge amount of difference .
So we started with them pro@@ t@@ oty@@ ping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impac@@ t .
"The first thing we did was we took a little bi@@ cy@@ cle mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r and we B@@ and@@ -@@ A@@ i@@ ded it here , on@@ to a g@@ ur@@ ney , a ho@@ spit@@ al tro@@ l@@ ley , so that when you were whe@@ e@@ led around by a n@@ ur@@ se or by a do@@ ctor , you could actually have a convers@@ ation with them ."
"You could , kind of , see them in your re@@ ar@@ -@@ view mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , so it created a t@@ iny human inter@@ action ."
V@@ ery small example of something that they could do .
"In@@ ter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , the n@@ ur@@ ses themselves , sort of , s@@ na@@ pped into action — said , OK , we em@@ brac@@ e this . What can we do ?"
The first thing they do is they de@@ cor@@ ated the ce@@ il@@ ing .
Wh@@ ich I thought was really — I show@@ ed this to my mother re@@ cent@@ ly .
I think my mother now thin@@ ks that I &apos;m some sort of inter@@ i@@ or de@@ cor@@ ator .
"It &apos;s what I do for a living , sort of L@@ au@@ r@@ ence L@@ le@@ wel@@ y@@ n@@ -@@ B@@ ow@@ en ."
"N@@ ot parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly the world &apos;s best design solution for those of us who are real , sort of , har@@ d-@@ cor@@ e desig@@ n@@ ers , but n@@ one@@ the@@ less , a f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous em@@ pa@@ th@@ ic solution for people ."
"Th@@ ings that they started doing themselves — like chang@@ ing the flo@@ or going into the patien@@ t &apos;s room so that it sig@@ ni@@ f@@ ied , &quot; &quot; This is my room . This is my per@@ s@@ onal space &quot; &quot; — was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem ."
So you went from public space to pri@@ v@@ ate space .
"And another idea , again , that came from one of the n@@ ur@@ ses — which I love — was they took tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal , sort of , cor@@ por@@ ate white bo@@ ar@@ ds , then they put them on one w@@ all of the patien@@ t &apos;s room , and they put this sti@@ ck@@ er there ."
"So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write mess@@ ages to the person who was si@@ ck in that room , which was lo@@ vely ."
"So , t@@ iny , t@@ iny , t@@ iny solu@@ tions that made a huge amount of impac@@ t ."
"I thought that was a really , really nice example ."
"So this is not parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly a new idea , kind of , seeing opportuni@@ ties in things that are around you and s@@ na@@ pping and tur@@ ning them into a solution ."
It &apos;s a history of inv@@ en@@ tion based around this .
I &apos;m going to read this because I want to get these na@@ mes right .
"J@@ o@@ an G@@ an@@ z Co@@ on@@ ey saw her d@@ aughter — came down on a S@@ atur@@ day morning , saw her d@@ aughter wat@@ ching the test car@@ d , wai@@ ting for progra@@ ms to come on one morning and from that came S@@ es@@ ame St@@ re@@ et ."
M@@ al@@ col@@ m M@@ c@@ Le@@ an was moving from one country to another and was wonder@@ ing why it took these guys so long to get the bo@@ x@@ es on@@ to the ship .
And he inv@@ en@@ ted the shi@@ pping con@@ tain@@ er .
"G@@ e@@ or@@ ge de M@@ est@@ ral — this is not bu@@ gs all over a B@@ ir@@ k@@ en@@ sto@@ ck — was wal@@ king his do@@ g in a fie@@ ld and got co@@ vered in bur@@ r@@ s , sort of little pri@@ ck@@ ly things , and from that came V@@ el@@ c@@ r@@ o ."
"And finally , for the Bri@@ ts , P@@ er@@ cy S@@ ha@@ w — this is a big Bri@@ ti@@ sh inv@@ en@@ tion — saw the c@@ at &apos;s eyes at the side of the ro@@ ad , when he was dri@@ ving home one night and from that came the C@@ at@@ se@@ y@@ e ."
"So there &apos;s a whole ser@@ ies of just using your eyes , seeing things for the first time , seeing things af@@ re@@ sh and using them as an opportunity to create new possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies ."
"S@@ econ@@ d one , without soun@@ ding over@@ ly Z@@ en , and this is a quot@@ e from the Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ a : &quot; &quot; F@@ in@@ ding yourself in the mar@@ gin@@ s , looking to the ed@@ ges of things , is often a really interesting place to start . &quot; &quot; B@@ lin@@ k@@ er@@ ed vision ten@@ ds to produ@@ ce , I think , b@@ lin@@ k@@ er@@ ed solu@@ tions ."
"So , looking wi@@ de , using your per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al vision , is a really interesting place to look for opportunity ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , another medi@@ cal example here ."
We were asked by a de@@ vice produ@@ cer — we did the P@@ al@@ m P@@ i@@ lot and the T@@ re@@ o .
We did a lot of se@@ x@@ y te@@ ch at I@@ deo — they &apos;d seen this and they wanted a se@@ x@@ y piece of technology for medi@@ cal di@@ ag@@ no@@ sti@@ cs .
This was a de@@ vice that a n@@ ur@@ se uses when they &apos;re doing a sp@@ in@@ al pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re in ho@@ spit@@ al .
They &apos;ll ask the n@@ ur@@ ses to in@@ put data .
"And they had this vision of the n@@ ur@@ se , kind of , c@@ lic@@ king away on this al@@ um@@ in@@ um de@@ vice and it all being incredi@@ bly , sort of , g@@ ad@@ ge@@ t-@@ lu@@ sti@@ sh ."
When we actually went and wat@@ ched this pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re taking place — and I &apos;ll expla@@ in this in a second — it became very obvi@@ ous that there was a human di@@ men@@ sion to this that they really wer@@ en &apos;t re@@ cogni@@ z@@ ing .
When you &apos;re having a f@@ our@@ -@@ in@@ ch need@@ le in@@ ser@@ ted into your sp@@ ine — which was the pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re that this de@@ vice &apos;s data was about ; it was for pa@@ in man@@ ag@@ ement — you &apos;re sh@@ it sc@@ ared ; you &apos;re fre@@ aking out .
"And so the first thing that pretty much every n@@ ur@@ se did , was h@@ old the patien@@ t &apos;s hand to comfor@@ t them . H@@ um@@ an g@@ est@@ ure — which made the f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous two@@ -@@ h@@ an@@ ded data in@@ put completely im@@ possible ."
"So , the thing that we desig@@ ned , much less se@@ x@@ y but much more human and prac@@ tical , was this ."
"So , it &apos;s not a P@@ al@@ m P@@ i@@ lot by any stre@@ t@@ ch of the imag@@ in@@ ation , but it has a th@@ um@@ b@@ -@@ sc@@ ro@@ ll so you can do everything with one hand ."
"So , again , going back to this — the idea that a t@@ iny human g@@ est@@ ure di@@ ct@@ ated the design of this produ@@ ct ."
"And I think that &apos;s really , really important ."
"So , again , this idea of wor@@ ka@@ ro@@ un@@ ds ."
"We use this ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; wor@@ ka@@ ro@@ un@@ ds &quot; &quot; a lot , sort of , looking around us . I was actually looking around the TED and just wat@@ ching all of these kind of things happen while I &apos;ve been here ."
This idea of the way that people c@@ ob@@ ble together solu@@ tions in our life — and the things we kind of do in our environment that are some@@ what sub@@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous but have huge poten@@ tial — is something that we look at a lot .
"We wro@@ te a book re@@ cent@@ ly , I think you might have re@@ cei@@ ved it , called &quot; &quot; Th@@ ou@@ gh@@ t@@ less A@@ cts ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s been all about these kind of thou@@ gh@@ t@@ less things that people do , which have huge inten@@ tion and huge opportunity ."
Why do we all fol@@ low the line in the stre@@ et ?
This is a picture in a J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese sub@@ way .
"P@@ e@@ ople con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously fol@@ low things even though , why , we don &apos;t know ."
Why do we line up the squ@@ are mi@@ l@@ k car@@ ton with the squ@@ are f@@ ence ?
Because we kind of have to — we &apos;re just compe@@ l@@ led to .
"We don &apos;t know why , but we do ."
Why do we w@@ ra@@ p the te@@ ab@@ a@@ g str@@ ing around the cu@@ p hand@@ le ?
"A@@ ga@@ in , we &apos;re sort of using the world around us to create our own design solu@@ tions ."
And we &apos;re always saying to our cl@@ ien@@ ts : &quot; &quot; You should look at this stuff .
This stuff is really important . This stuff is really vi@@ tal . &quot; &quot; This is people desig@@ ning their own exper@@ ien@@ ces .
You can dra@@ w from this .
"We sort of as@@ su@@ me that because there &apos;s a po@@ le in the stre@@ et , that it &apos;s o@@ kay to use it , so we par@@ k our sh@@ op@@ ping car@@ t there ."
"It &apos;s there for our use , on some level ."
"So , again , we sort of co@@ -@@ op@@ t our environment to do all these different things ."
We co@@ -@@ op@@ t other exper@@ ien@@ ces — we take one i@@ tem and trans@@ f@@ er it to another .
"And this is my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te one . My mother used to say to me , &quot; J@@ ust because your si@@ ster j@@ um@@ ps in the l@@ ake doesn &apos;t mean you have to . &quot;"
"But , of course , we all do . We all fol@@ low each other every day ."
"So somebody as@@ su@@ mes that because somebody else has done something , that &apos;s per@@ mis@@ sion for them to do the same thing ."
And there &apos;s almost this sort of se@@ ma@@ ph@@ ore around us all the time .
"I mean , sh@@ op@@ ping ba@@ g equ@@ als &quot; &quot; par@@ king me@@ ter out of order . &quot; &quot; And we all , kind of , know how to read these sig@@ n@@ als now ."
We all talk to one another in this high@@ ly vi@@ su@@ al way without realiz@@ ing what we &apos;re doing .
"Th@@ ird se@@ ction is this idea of not know@@ ing , of con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously pu@@ tting yourself back@@ war@@ ds ."
I talk about un@@ thinking situ@@ ations all the time .
"S@@ or@@ t of having begin@@ ner &apos;s mind , sc@@ ra@@ ping your mind cle@@ an and looking at things af@@ re@@ sh ."
"A friend of m@@ ine was a desig@@ ner at I@@ K@@ E@@ A , and he was asked by his b@@ os@@ s to help design a stor@@ age system for children ."
This is the B@@ il@@ ly bo@@ ok@@ case — it &apos;s I@@ K@@ E@@ A &apos;s bi@@ ggest sel@@ ling produ@@ ct .
"H@@ am@@ m@@ er it together . H@@ am@@ m@@ er it together with a sho@@ e , if you &apos;re me , because they &apos;re im@@ possible to as@@ se@@ m@@ ble ."
But big sel@@ ling bo@@ ok@@ case . How do we re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate this for children ?
"The re@@ ality is when you actually wat@@ ch children , children don &apos;t think about things like stor@@ age in lin@@ e@@ ar terms ."
Ch@@ il@@ dren as@@ su@@ me per@@ mis@@ sion in a very different way .
Ch@@ il@@ dren live on things . They live under things .
"They live around things , and so their sp@@ ati@@ al aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess relation@@ ship , and their thinking around stor@@ age is tot@@ ally different ."
"So the first thing you have to do — this is G@@ ra@@ ha@@ m , the desig@@ ner — is , sort of , put yourself in their sho@@ es . And so , here he is sitting under the table ."
"So , what came out of this ?"
This is the stor@@ age system that he desig@@ ned .
"So what is this ? I hear you all ask . No , I don &apos;t ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s this , and I think this is a parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly lo@@ vely solution ."
"So , you know , it &apos;s a tot@@ ally different way of looking at the situ@@ ation ."
It &apos;s a completely em@@ pa@@ th@@ ic solution — a@@ part from the fact that te@@ d@@ dy &apos;s probably not lo@@ ving it .
"( Laughter ) But a really nice way of re@@ -@@ fra@@ ming the ordin@@ ary , and I think that &apos;s one of the things ."
"And pu@@ tting yourself in the posi@@ tion of the person , and I think that &apos;s one of the thre@@ ads that I &apos;ve heard again from this con@@ fer@@ ence is how do we put ourselves in other pe@@ op@@ les &apos; sho@@ es and really feel what they feel ?"
And then use that information to fu@@ el solu@@ tions ?
And I think that &apos;s what this is very much about .
L@@ ast se@@ ction : green ar@@ m@@ b@@ and . We &apos;ve all got them .
It &apos;s about this really .
"I mean , it &apos;s about pi@@ c@@ king bat@@ t@@ les big enough to matter but small enough to wi@@ n ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , that &apos;s one of the the@@ mes that I think has come through l@@ ou@@ d and clear in this con@@ fer@@ ence is : W@@ here do we start ? How do we start ? What do we do to start ?"
"So , again , we were asked to design a water pu@@ m@@ p for a company called Ap@@ pro@@ TE@@ C , in Ken@@ ya ."
They &apos;re now called K@@ i@@ ck@@ St@@ art .
"And , again , as desig@@ n@@ ers , we wanted to make this thing incredi@@ bly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form ."
And that was completely ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant .
"When you put yourself in the posi@@ tion of these people , things like the fact that this has to be able to f@@ old up and f@@ it on a bi@@ cy@@ cle , become much more rele@@ v@@ ant than the form of it . The way it &apos;s produ@@ ced , it has to be produ@@ ced with indi@@ gen@@ ous man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing meth@@ ods and indi@@ gen@@ ous materi@@ als ."
So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the us@@ er .
We had to completely trans@@ f@@ er ourselves over to their world .
"So what seem@@ s like a very clu@@ n@@ k@@ y produ@@ ct is , in fact , incredi@@ bly us@@ e@@ ful ."
It &apos;s power@@ ed a bit like a S@@ ta@@ ir@@ ma@@ ster — you pu@@ m@@ p up and down on it .
Ch@@ il@@ dren can use it . A@@ du@@ l@@ ts can use it . E@@ very@@ body uses it .
"It &apos;s tur@@ ning these guys — again , one of the the@@ mes — it &apos;s tur@@ ning them into ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s ."
These guys are using this very suc@@ cess@@ fully .
"And for us , it &apos;s been great because it &apos;s won lo@@ ads of design aw@@ ar@@ ds ."
"So we actually man@@ aged to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le the needs of the design company , the needs of the individu@@ als in the company , to feel good about a produ@@ ct we were actually desig@@ ning , and the needs of the individu@@ als we were desig@@ ning it for ."
"There it is , pu@@ m@@ ping water from 30 fe@@ et ."
So as a fin@@ al g@@ est@@ ure we h@@ an@@ ded out these brac@@ ele@@ ts to all of you this morning .
"We &apos;ve made a d@@ on@@ ation on everybody &apos;s be@@ half here to ki@@ ck start , no pu@@ n inten@@ ded , their next project ."
"Because , again , I think , sort of , pu@@ tting our money where our m@@ outh is , here ."
We feel that this is an important g@@ est@@ ure .
So we &apos;ve h@@ an@@ ded out brac@@ ele@@ ts . S@@ mall is the new big .
I hope you &apos;ll all we@@ ar them .
So that &apos;s it . Thank you .

"When my bro@@ ther called me in De@@ c@@ em@@ ber of 199@@ 8 , he said , &quot; &quot; The news does not look good . &quot; &quot; This is him on the scre@@ en ."
"He &apos;d just been di@@ ag@@ no@@ sed with A@@ L@@ S , which is a dise@@ ase that the a@@ ver@@ age li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an is three years ."
It par@@ al@@ yz@@ es you . It star@@ ts by kil@@ ling the mot@@ or neuron@@ s in your sp@@ in@@ al cor@@ d .
"And you go from being a health@@ y , rob@@ ust 2@@ 9@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old m@@ ale to someone that cannot bre@@ a@@ the , cannot move , cannot speak ."
"This has actually been , to me , a gi@@ ft , because we began a jour@@ ney to learn a new way of thinking about life ."
And even though Ste@@ ven pas@@ sed away three years ago we had an amazing jour@@ ney as a family .
We did not even — I think ad@@ versity is not even the right word .
"We looked at this and we said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to do something with this in an incredi@@ bly posi@@ tive way . &quot; &quot; And I want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do , which was to think about a new way of appro@@ ach@@ ing health@@ care ."
"Because , as we all know here today , it doesn &apos;t work very well ."
I want to talk about it in the con@@ te@@ xt of a story .
This is the story of my bro@@ ther .
"But it &apos;s just a story . And I want to go be@@ y@@ ond the story , and go to something more ."
"&quot; &quot; G@@ i@@ ven my stat@@ us , what is the best out@@ come I can hope to ach@@ ie@@ ve , and how do I get there ? &quot; &quot; is what we are here to do in medi@@ cine , is what everyone should do ."
And those questions all have v@@ ari@@ ab@@ les to them .
All of our stat@@ uses are different .
"A@@ ll of our hop@@ es and dre@@ am@@ s , what we want to ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh , is different , and our pa@@ ths will be different , they are all stories ."
"But it &apos;s a story until we con@@ ver@@ t it to data and so what we do , this con@@ cept we had , was to take Ste@@ ven &apos;s stat@@ us , &quot; &quot; What is my stat@@ us ? &quot; &quot; and go from this con@@ cept of wal@@ king , bre@@ a@@ thing , and then his h@@ ands , speak , and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely happ@@ iness and fun@@ ction ."
"So , the first set of pa@@ th@@ o@@ log@@ ies , they end up in the sti@@ ck man on his i@@ c@@ on , but the rest of them are really what &apos;s important here ."
"Because Ste@@ ven , des@@ pi@@ te the fact that he was par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , as he was in that po@@ ol , he could not walk , he could not use his ar@@ ms — that &apos;s why he had the little flo@@ aty things on them , did you see those ? — he was happy . We were at the be@@ ach , he was ra@@ is@@ ing his son , and he was produ@@ ctive ."
"And we took this , and we con@@ ver@@ ted it into data ."
But it &apos;s not a data point at that one moment in time .
It is a data point of Ste@@ ven in a con@@ te@@ xt .
"H@@ ere he is in the po@@ ol . But here he is health@@ y , as a buil@@ der : tal@@ ler , stron@@ ger , got all the women , amazing guy ."
"H@@ ere he is wal@@ king down the a@@ is@@ le , but he can bar@@ ely walk now , so it &apos;s im@@ pa@@ i@@ red ."
"And he could still h@@ old his wi@@ fe &apos;s hand , but he couldn &apos;t do bu@@ t@@ t@@ ons on his clo@@ the@@ s , can &apos;t fe@@ ed hi@@ m@@ self ."
"And here he is , par@@ al@@ y@@ zed completely , u@@ na@@ ble to bre@@ a@@ the and move , over this time jour@@ ney ."
"These stories of his life , con@@ ver@@ ted to data ."
"He ren@@ o@@ v@@ ated my car@@ ri@@ age house when he was completely par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , and u@@ na@@ ble to speak , and u@@ na@@ ble to bre@@ a@@ the , and he won an aw@@ ard for a histor@@ ic re@@ stor@@ ation ."
"So , here &apos;s Ste@@ ven alone , sh@@ aring this story in the world ."
"And this is the in@@ si@@ ght , the thing that we are exci@@ ted about , because we have gone away from the community that we are , the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other ."
We need to give to others to be suc@@ cess@@ ful .
"So , Ste@@ ven is sh@@ aring this story , but he is not alone ."
There are so many other people sh@@ aring their stories .
"N@@ ot stories in words , but stories in data and words ."
"And we con@@ ver@@ t that information into this structure , this under@@ standing , this ability to con@@ ver@@ t those stories into something that is compu@@ table , to which we can beg@@ in to change the way medi@@ cine is done and deli@@ vered ."
"We did this for A@@ L@@ S . We can do this for de@@ pres@@ sion , Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ ase , HIV ."
"These are not simple , they are not inter@@ net sc@@ al@@ able ; they requi@@ re thought and pro@@ cess@@ es to find the me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful information about the dise@@ ase ."
"So , this is what it looks like when you go to the we@@ b@@ site ."
"And I &apos;m going to show you what P@@ at@@ ien@@ ts Li@@ ke M@@ e , the company that myself , my youn@@ gest bro@@ ther and a good friend from M@@ I@@ T started ."
"H@@ ere are the ac@@ tu@@ al patients , there are 4@@ 5@@ ,000 of them now , sh@@ aring their stories as data ."
Here is an M@@ .@@ S. patien@@ t .
"H@@ is name is Mi@@ ke , and he is uni@@ form@@ ly im@@ pa@@ i@@ red on cogni@@ tion , vision , wal@@ king , sen@@ s@@ ation ."
Th@@ ose are things that are different for each M@@ .@@ S. patien@@ t .
E@@ ach of them can have a different char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ stic .
"You can see fi@@ bro@@ my@@ al@@ gi@@ a , HIV , A@@ L@@ S , de@@ pres@@ sion ."
"L@@ ook at this HIV patien@@ t down here , Z@@ inny ."
It &apos;s two years of this dise@@ ase . All of the sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s are not there .
But he is working to keep his C@@ D@@ 4 coun@@ t high and his vi@@ ral level low so he can make his life better .
But you can ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate this and you can disco@@ ver things about tre@@ at@@ ments .
"L@@ ook at this , 2@@ ,000 people almost , on C@@ op@@ ax@@ one ."
"These are patients cur@@ r@@ ently on dru@@ gs , sh@@ aring data ."
"I love some of these , physi@@ cal ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se , pra@@ y@@ er ."
An@@ y@@ one want to run a com@@ par@@ ative effe@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess study on pra@@ y@@ er against something ? Let &apos;s look at pra@@ y@@ er .
"What I love about this , just sort of interesting design problems ."
These are why people pra@@ y .
Here is the s@@ che@@ du@@ le of how fre@@ qu@@ ently they — it &apos;s a do@@ se .
"So , any@@ one want to see the 3@@ 2 patients that pra@@ y for 60 minutes a day , and see if they &apos;re doing better , they probably are ."
"H@@ ere they are . It &apos;s an open network , everybody is sh@@ aring . We can see it all ."
"O@@ r , I want to look at an@@ x@@ ie@@ ty , because people are pra@@ ying for an@@ x@@ ie@@ ty ."
"And here is data on 1@@ 5@@ ,000 people &apos;s cur@@ r@@ ent an@@ x@@ ie@@ ty , right now ."
"H@@ ow they tre@@ at it , the dru@@ gs , the com@@ pon@@ ents of it , their side effe@@ cts , all of it in a ri@@ ch environment , and you can dri@@ ll down and see the individu@@ als ."
"This amazing data allow@@ s us to dri@@ ll down and see what this dru@@ g is for — 1@@ ,@@ 500 people on this dru@@ g , I think . Yes ."
I want to talk to the 5@@ 8 patients down here who are taking four mi@@ lli@@ gra@@ ms a day .
And I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing it for more than two years .
"So , you can see the du@@ r@@ ation ."
"A@@ ll open , all available ."
I &apos;m going to lo@@ g in .
And this is my bro@@ ther &apos;s pro@@ fi@@ le .
And this is a new ver@@ sion of our pl@@ at@@ form we &apos;re la@@ un@@ ching right now .
This is the second gener@@ ation . It &apos;s going to be in F@@ las@@ h .
"And you can see here , as this ani@@ mat@@ es over , Ste@@ ven &apos;s ac@@ tu@@ al data against the back@@ ground of all other patients , against this information ."
"The blue b@@ and is the 5@@ 0@@ th per@@ cen@@ ti@@ le . Ste@@ ven is the 7@@ 5@@ th per@@ cen@@ ti@@ le , that he has n@@ on-@@ gen@@ e@@ tic A@@ L@@ S ."
"You sc@@ ro@@ ll down in this pro@@ fi@@ le and you can see all of his pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ption dru@@ gs , but more than that , in the new ver@@ sion , I can look at this inter@@ acti@@ vely ."
"W@@ a@@ it , po@@ or sp@@ in@@ al ca@@ pac@@ ity ."
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t this re@@ mind you of a great sto@@ ck program ?
W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves was as good as the technology we use to make money ?
"D@@ e@@ tro@@ l . In the side effe@@ cts for his dru@@ g , inte@@ gr@@ ated into that , the stem cell tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant that he had , the first in the world , sh@@ ared open@@ ly for any@@ one who wan@@ ts to see it ."
"I love here — the cy@@ ber@@ kin@@ e@@ ti@@ cs im@@ pl@@ ant , which was , again , the only patien@@ t &apos;s data that was on@@ line and available ."
You can ad@@ just the time scale . You can ad@@ just the sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s .
You can look at the inter@@ action between how I tre@@ at my A@@ L@@ S .
"So , you cli@@ ck down on the A@@ L@@ S ta@@ b there ."
I &apos;m taking three dru@@ gs to man@@ age it . S@@ ome of them are experim@@ ent@@ al .
"I can look at my con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , how to man@@ age it ."
"I can see mag@@ ne@@ si@@ um ci@@ tr@@ ate , and the side effe@@ cts from that dru@@ g all inte@@ gr@@ ated in the time in which they &apos;re me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful ."
But I want more .
"I don &apos;t want to just look at this cool de@@ vice , I want to take this data and make something even better ."
"I want my bro@@ ther &apos;s cen@@ ter of the universe and his sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s and his dru@@ gs , and all of the things that inter@@ act am@@ ong those , the side effe@@ cts , to be in this beautiful data gal@@ ax@@ y that we can look at in any way we want to understand it , so that we can take this information and go be@@ y@@ ond just this simple model of what a recor@@ d is ."
I don &apos;t even know what a medi@@ cal recor@@ d is .
I want to sol@@ ve a problem . I want an app@@ lic@@ ation .
"So , can I take this data — re@@ ar@@ r@@ ange yourself , put the sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s in the left , the dru@@ gs across the top , tell me everything we know about Ste@@ ven and everyone else , and what inter@@ ac@@ ts ."
"@@ Y@@ ear@@ s after he &apos;s had these dru@@ gs , I learned that everything he did to man@@ age his ex@@ cess s@@ ali@@ v@@ a , inclu@@ ding some posi@@ tive side effe@@ cts that came from other dru@@ gs , were making his con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation wor@@ se ."
"And if any@@ one &apos;s ever had se@@ v@@ ere con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , and you don &apos;t understand how much of an impac@@ t that has on your life — y@@ es , that was a pu@@ n ."
"You &apos;re trying to man@@ age these , and this g@@ ri@@ d is available here , and we want to understand it ."
No one &apos;s ever had this kind of information .
"So , patients have this . We &apos;re for patients ."
"This is all about patien@@ t health care , there was no do@@ ct@@ ors on our network ."
This is about the patients .
"So , how can we take this and bring them a to@@ ol that they can go back and they can eng@@ age the medi@@ cal system ?"
"And we worked hard , and we thought about it and we said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s something we can use all the time , that we can use in the medi@@ cal care system , that everyone will understand ? &quot; &quot; So , the patients pr@@ int it out , because ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s usu@@ ally blo@@ ck us because they believe we are a social network ."
It &apos;s actually the most used fe@@ ature on the we@@ b@@ site .
"D@@ o@@ ct@@ ors actually love this sh@@ e@@ et , and they &apos;re actually really eng@@ aged ."
"So , we went from this story of Ste@@ ven and his history to data , and then back to pa@@ per , where we went back and eng@@ aged the medi@@ cal care system ."
And here &apos;s another pa@@ per .
"This is a jour@@ na@@ l , P@@ N@@ A@@ S — I think it &apos;s the Pro@@ ce@@ ed@@ ings of the N@@ ational A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of S@@ cien@@ ce of the United States of America ."
"You &apos;ve seen mul@@ ti@@ ple of these today , when everyone &apos;s bra@@ gg@@ ing about the amazing things they &apos;ve done ."
This is a re@@ port about a dru@@ g called li@@ thi@@ um .
"L@@ i@@ thi@@ um , that is a dru@@ g used to tre@@ at bi@@ pol@@ ar di@@ sor@@ der , that a group in I@@ tal@@ y found s@@ low@@ ed A@@ L@@ S down in 16 patients , and publi@@ shed it ."
"Now , we &apos;ll sk@@ i@@ p the cri@@ ti@@ qu@@ es of the pa@@ per ."
"But the shor@@ t story is : If you &apos;re a patien@@ t , you want to be on the blue line ."
"You don &apos;t want to be on the red line , you want to be on the blue line ."
"Because the blue line is a better line . The red line is way dow@@ n@@ hi@@ ll , the blue line is a good line ."
"So , you know we said — we looked at this , and what I love also is that people always ac@@ c@@ use these Inter@@ net si@@ tes of pro@@ mot@@ ing bad medi@@ cine and having people do things ir@@ respon@@ si@@ bly ."
"So , this is what happened when P@@ N@@ A@@ S publi@@ shed this ."
Ten percent of the people in our system took li@@ thi@@ um .
Ten percent of the patients started taking li@@ thi@@ um based on 16 patients of data in a bad publi@@ cation .
And they call the Inter@@ net ir@@ respon@@ si@@ ble .
Here &apos;s the im@@ p@@ lic@@ ation of what happens .
"There &apos;s this one guy , na@@ med H@@ um@@ ber@@ to , from B@@ raz@@ il , who un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely pas@@ sed away n@@ ine months ago , who said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , list@@ en . C@@ an you help us answer this question ?"
"Because I don &apos;t want to wa@@ it for the next tri@@ al , it &apos;s going to be years ."
"I want to know now . C@@ an you help us ? &quot; &quot; So , we la@@ un@@ ched some to@@ ols , we let them tr@@ ack their blo@@ od le@@ v@@ els ."
We let them share the data and ex@@ change it .
"You know , a data network ."
"And they said , you know , &quot; &quot; J@@ am@@ ie , P@@ L@@ M , can you guys tell us whether this works or not ? &quot; &quot; And we went around and we tal@@ ked to people , and they said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t run a c@@ lini@@ cal tri@@ al like this . You know ?"
"You don &apos;t have the b@@ lin@@ ding , you don &apos;t have data , it doesn &apos;t fol@@ low the scienti@@ fic meth@@ od ."
"It &apos;s never going to work . You can &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; So , I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay well we can &apos;t do that . Th@@ en we can do something har@@ der . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I can &apos;t say whether li@@ thi@@ um works in all A@@ L@@ S patients , but I can say whether it works in H@@ um@@ ber@@ to ."
"I b@@ ou@@ ght a Ma@@ c about two years ago , I con@@ ver@@ ted over , and I was so exci@@ ted about this new fe@@ ature of the time mach@@ ine that came in Le@@ op@@ ard . And we said — because it &apos;s really cool , you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer , and find everything you &apos;ve lost , and I lo@@ ved it ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; What if we built a time mach@@ ine for patients , ex@@ cept instead of going back@@ war@@ ds , we go for@@ war@@ ds ."
"C@@ an we find out what &apos;s going to happen to you , so that you can maybe change it ? &quot; &quot; So , we did . We took all the patients like H@@ um@@ ber@@ to , That &apos;s the A@@ pp@@ le back@@ ground , we sto@@ le that because we didn &apos;t have time to build our own . This is a real ap@@ p by the way ."
This is not just gra@@ phi@@ cs .
"And you take those data , and we find the patients like him , and we bring their data together . And we bring their histor@@ ies into it ."
"And then we say , &quot; &quot; Well how do we line them all up ? &quot; &quot; So , we line them all up so they go together around the me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful poin@@ ts , inte@@ gr@@ ated across everything we know about the patien@@ t ."
"F@@ u@@ ll information , the entire course of their dise@@ ase ."
"And that &apos;s what is going to happen to H@@ um@@ ber@@ to , un@@ less he does something ."
"And he took li@@ thi@@ um , and he went down the line ."
And it works almost every time .
"Now , the ones that it doesn &apos;t work are interesting ."
But almost all the time it works .
It &apos;s actually sc@@ ary . It &apos;s beautiful .
"So , we couldn &apos;t run a c@@ lini@@ cal tri@@ al , we couldn &apos;t figure it out ."
But we could see whether it was going to work for H@@ um@@ ber@@ to .
"And ye@@ ah , all the c@@ lini@@ ci@@ ans in the audience will talk about power and all the stan@@ d@@ ard de@@ vi@@ ation . We &apos;ll do that later ."
But here is the answer of the mean of the patients that actually decided to take li@@ thi@@ um .
These are all the patients that started li@@ thi@@ um .
It &apos;s the In@@ t@@ ent to T@@ re@@ at C@@ ur@@ ve .
"You can see here , the blue d@@ ots on the top , the light ones , those are the people in the study in P@@ N@@ A@@ S that you wanted to be on . And the red ones are the ones , the p@@ in@@ k ones on the bot@@ tom are the ones you didn &apos;t want to be ."
"And the ones in the mi@@ ddle are all of our patients from the start of li@@ thi@@ um at time zer@@ o , going forward , and then going back@@ ward ."
"So , you can see we mat@@ ched them perfe@@ ct@@ ly , perfe@@ ct@@ ly ."
T@@ er@@ ri@@ f@@ y@@ ing@@ ly ac@@ cur@@ ate mat@@ ching .
"And going forward , you actually don &apos;t want to be a li@@ thi@@ um patien@@ t this time ."
"You &apos;re actually doing sli@@ gh@@ tly wor@@ se — not sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ tly , but sli@@ gh@@ tly wor@@ se . You don &apos;t want to be a li@@ thi@@ um patien@@ t this time ."
"But you know , a lot of people dro@@ pped out , the tri@@ al , there is too much dro@@ p out ."
"C@@ an we do the even har@@ der thing ? C@@ an we go to the patients that actually decided to st@@ ay on li@@ thi@@ um , because they were so con@@ v@@ in@@ ced they were getting better ?"
"We asked our control al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m , are those 6@@ 9 patients — by the way , you &apos;ll noti@@ ce that &apos;s four times the number of patients in the c@@ lini@@ cal tri@@ al — can we look at those patients and say , &quot; &quot; C@@ an we mat@@ ch them with our time mach@@ ine to the other patients that are just like them , and what happens ? &quot; &quot; E@@ ven the ones that belie@@ ved they were getting better mat@@ ched the contro@@ ls exactly . E@@ x@@ actly ."
Th@@ ose little lin@@ es ? That &apos;s the power .
"So , we — I can &apos;t tell you li@@ thi@@ um doesn &apos;t work . I can &apos;t tell you that if you did it at a high@@ er do@@ se or if you run the study pro@@ per — I can tell you that for those 6@@ 9 people that took li@@ thi@@ um , they didn &apos;t do any better than the people that were just like them , just like me , and that we had the power to de@@ te@@ ct that at about a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the str@@ eng@@ ths re@@ por@@ ted in the ini@@ tial study ."
"We did that one year a@@ head of the time when the first c@@ lini@@ cal tri@@ al fun@@ ded by the N@@ I@@ H for mi@@ llions of dollars fai@@ led for fu@@ ti@@ lity last week , and an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced it ."
"So , remember I told you about my bro@@ ther &apos;s stem cell tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant ."
I never really knew whether it worked .
"And I put 100 million cells in his ci@@ ster@@ na mag@@ na , in his lu@@ m@@ b@@ ar cor@@ d , and fil@@ led out the I@@ R@@ B@@ s and did all this work , and I never really knew ."
How did I not know ?
"I mean , I didn &apos;t know what was going to happen to him ."
"I actually asked T@@ im , who is the qu@@ ant in our group — we actually sear@@ ched for about a year to find someone who could do the sort of mat@@ h and st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs and mode@@ ling in health@@ care , couldn &apos;t find any@@ body . So , we went to the fin@@ ance indu@@ stry ."
"And there are these guys who used to model the future of inter@@ est r@@ ates , and all that kind of stuff ."
"And some of them were available . So , we hi@@ red one ."
"( Laughter ) We hi@@ red them , set them up , as@@ si@@ st@@ ing at la@@ b ."
"I I@@ .@@ M@@ . him things . That &apos;s the way I communi@@ cate with him , is like a little guy in a box . I I@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ ed T@@ im . I said , &quot; &quot; T@@ im can you tell me whether my bro@@ ther &apos;s stem cell tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant worked or not ? &quot; &quot; And he s@@ ent me this two days ago ."
It was that little out@@ lie@@ r@@ s there . You see that guy that li@@ ved a long time ?
We have to go talk to him . Because I &apos;d like to know what happened .
Because something went different .
But my bro@@ ther didn &apos;t . My bro@@ ther went stra@@ ight down the line .
It only works about 12 months .
It &apos;s the first ver@@ sion of the time mach@@ ine .
F@@ ir@@ st time we ever tr@@ ied it . We &apos;ll try to get it better later but 12 months so far .
"And , you know , I look at this , and I get really emoti@@ onal ."
"You look at the patients , you can dri@@ ll in all the contro@@ ls , you can look at them , you can ask them ."
"And I found a woman that had — we found her , she was od@@ d because she had data after she d@@ ied ."
"And her h@@ us@@ b@@ and had come in and en@@ ter@@ ed her last fun@@ cti@@ onal s@@ co@@ res , because he knew how much she car@@ ed ."
And I am th@@ an@@ k@@ ful .
"I can &apos;t believe that these people , years after my bro@@ ther had d@@ ied , hel@@ ped me answer the question about whether an oper@@ ation I did , and spent mi@@ llions of dollars on years ago , worked or not ."
"I wi@@ shed it had been there when I &apos;d done it the first time , and I &apos;m really exci@@ ted that it &apos;s here now , because the la@@ b that I f@@ oun@@ ded has some data on a dru@@ g that might work , and I &apos;d like to show it ."
"I &apos;d like to show it in real time , now , and I want to do that for all of the dise@@ ases that we can do that for ."
"I &apos;ve got to th@@ ank the 4@@ 5@@ ,000 people that are doing this social experim@@ ent with us ."
"There is an amazing jour@@ ney we are going on to become human again , to be part of community again , to share of ourselves , to be v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able , and it &apos;s very exci@@ ting . So , th@@ ank you ."
( Applause )
"I don &apos;t know about you , but I ha@@ ven &apos;t quite figu@@ red out exactly what technology means in my life ."
I &apos;ve spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about .
S@@ h@@ ould I be pro@@ -@@ technology ? S@@ h@@ ould I em@@ brac@@ e it full ar@@ ms ?
"S@@ h@@ ould I be war@@ y ? Li@@ ke you , I &apos;m very tem@@ p@@ ted by the lat@@ est thing ."
"But at the other hand , a couple of years ago I gave up all of my pos@@ s@@ es@@ sions , s@@ old all my technology — ex@@ cept for a bi@@ cy@@ cle — and ro@@ de across 3@@ ,000 miles on the U.@@ S. back ro@@ ads under the power of my one body , fu@@ el@@ led mo@@ st@@ ly by T@@ win@@ kie@@ s and j@@ un@@ k food ."
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;ve since then tr@@ ied to keep technology at ar@@ m &apos;s len@@ g@@ th in many ways , so it doesn &apos;t ma@@ ster my life ."
"A@@ t the same time , I run a we@@ b@@ site on cool to@@ ols , where I issue a da@@ i@@ ly ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion of the lat@@ est things in technology ."
"So I &apos;m still per@@ ple@@ x@@ ed about what the true me@@ an@@ ing of technology is as it re@@ lat@@ es to hum@@ ani@@ ty , as it re@@ lat@@ es to nature , as it re@@ lat@@ es to the spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al ."
And I &apos;m not even sure we know what technology is .
And one defini@@ tion of technology is that which is first recor@@ ded .
This is the first example of the moder@@ n use of technology that I can find .
It was the su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us for de@@ al@@ ing with the Ap@@ pl@@ ied Ar@@ ts and S@@ cien@@ ce at C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge Uni@@ versity in 1@@ 8@@ 2@@ 9 .
"Be@@ fore that , obvi@@ ously , technology didn &apos;t exi@@ st . But obvi@@ ously it did ."
I like one of the defini@@ tions that Al@@ an K@@ ay has for technology .
He says technology is anything that was inv@@ en@@ ted after you were born .
( Laughter ) So it su@@ ms up a lot of what we &apos;re talking about .
D@@ an@@ ny H@@ il@@ l@@ is actually has an up@@ d@@ ate on that — he says technology is anything that doesn &apos;t quite work yet .
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich also , I think , gets into a little bit of our cur@@ r@@ ent idea ."
But I was interested in another defini@@ tion of technology .
"S@@ ome@@ thing , again , that went back to something more fundam@@ ent@@ al ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing that was de@@ e@@ per . And as I stru@@ gg@@ led to understand that , I came up with a way of fra@@ ming the question that seem@@ ed to work for me in my inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ations ."
"And I &apos;m , this morning , going to talk about this for the first time ."
So this is a very rou@@ gh at@@ tem@@ pt to think out l@@ ou@@ d .
"The question that I came up with was this question : what does technology want ? And by that , I don &apos;t mean , does it want cho@@ col@@ ate or v@@ ani@@ l@@ la ? B@@ y what it wan@@ ts , I mean , what are its in@@ her@@ ent tr@@ en@@ ds and bi@@ ases ?"
"What are its ten@@ den@@ cies over time ? One way to think about this is thinking about biologi@@ cal organi@@ s@@ ms , which we &apos;ve heard a lot about ."
"And the tri@@ ck that Ri@@ ch@@ ard D@@ aw@@ k@@ ins does , which is to say , to look at them as simply as gen@@ es , as ve@@ hi@@ cles for gen@@ es ."
"So he &apos;s saying , what do gen@@ es want ? The sel@@ fish gen@@ e ."
"And I &apos;m ap@@ pl@@ ying a si@@ mi@@ lar tri@@ ck to say , what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology ? What does technology want ?"
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , this in an in@@ comple@@ te question , just as looking at an organi@@ sm as only a gen@@ e is an in@@ comple@@ te way of looking at it ."
"But it &apos;s still very , very produ@@ ctive . So I &apos;m at@@ tem@@ p@@ ting to say , if we take technology &apos;s view of the world , what does it want ?"
"And I think once we ask that question we have to go back , actually , to life . Because obvi@@ ously , if we keep ex@@ ten@@ ding the ori@@ gin@@ s of technology far back , I think we come back to life at some point ."
"So that &apos;s where I want to beg@@ in my little expl@@ or@@ ation , is in life ."
"And like you heard from the pre@@ vi@@ ous spe@@ ak@@ ers , we don &apos;t really know what life there is on Earth right now ."
We have really no idea .
C@@ ra@@ i@@ g V@@ enter &apos;s tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous and bri@@ lli@@ ant at@@ tem@@ pt to DNA sequ@@ ence things in the ocean is great .
Bri@@ an F@@ ar@@ re@@ ll &apos;s work is all part of this ag@@ en@@ da to try and actually disco@@ ver all the species on Earth .
"And one of the things that we should do is just make a g@@ ri@@ d of the g@@ lo@@ be and ran@@ dom@@ ly go and in@@ spe@@ ct all the places that the g@@ ri@@ d inter@@ se@@ cts , just to see what &apos;s on life . And if we did that with our little Mar@@ ti@@ an pro@@ be , which we have not done on Earth , we would beg@@ in to see some incredible species ."
This is not on another planet . These are things that are hi@@ d@@ den away on our planet .
This is an ant that sto@@ res its colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es &apos; hon@@ ey in its ab@@ dom@@ en .
"E@@ ach one of these organi@@ s@@ ms that we &apos;ve descri@@ bed — that you &apos;ve seen from J@@ am@@ ie and others , these mag@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent things — what they &apos;re doing , each one of them , is they &apos;re h@@ ac@@ king the ru@@ les of life ."
I can &apos;t think of a single gener@@ al prin@@ ci@@ ple of bio@@ logy that does not have an ex@@ cep@@ tion some@@ where by some organi@@ sm .
"E@@ very single thing that we can think of — and if you heard O@@ li@@ vi@@ a &apos;s talk about the se@@ x@@ u@@ al ha@@ bi@@ ts , you &apos;ll realize that there isn &apos;t anything we can say that &apos;s true for all life , because every single one of them is h@@ ac@@ king something about it ."
This is a sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed se@@ a s@@ lu@@ g . It &apos;s a nu@@ di@@ bran@@ ch that has in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated ch@@ lo@@ ro@@ pl@@ ast inside it to dri@@ ve its energy .
"This is another ver@@ sion of that . This is a se@@ a dra@@ g@@ on , and the one on the bot@@ tom , the blue one , is a ju@@ v@@ eni@@ le that has not yet s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed the ac@@ id , has not yet taken in the b@@ row@@ n@@ -@@ green al@@ ga@@ e po@@ nd s@@ cu@@ m into its body to give it energy ."
"These are h@@ ac@@ ks , and if we looked at the gener@@ al sha@@ pe of the appro@@ ach@@ es to h@@ ac@@ king life there are , cur@@ r@@ ent con@@ sen@@ su@@ s , six k@@ ing@@ dom@@ s . S@@ i@@ x different bro@@ ad appro@@ ach@@ es : the plan@@ ts , the animals , the fun@@ gi , the prote@@ sts — the little things — the bac@@ ter@@ ia and the Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a bac@@ ter@@ ia . The Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ as ."
Th@@ ose are the gener@@ al appro@@ ach@@ es to life . That &apos;s one way to look at life on Earth today .
"But a more interesting way , the cur@@ r@@ ent way to take the long view , is to look at it in an ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary perspe@@ ctive ."
"And here we have a view of ev@@ olution where rather than having ev@@ olution go over the lin@@ e@@ ar time , we have it coming out from the cen@@ ter ."
"So in the cen@@ ter is the most pri@@ mi@@ tive , and this is a gen@@ e@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ cal char@@ t of all life on ear@@ th . This is all the same six k@@ ing@@ dom@@ s ."
"You see 4@@ ,000 re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative species , and you can see where we are ."
But what I like about this is it shows that every living organi@@ sm on Earth today is equ@@ ally ev@@ olved .
Th@@ ose fun@@ gi and bac@@ ter@@ ia are as high@@ ly ev@@ olved as hum@@ ans .
They &apos;ve been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of tri@@ al and er@@ ro@@ r to get here .
"But we see that each one of these is actually h@@ ac@@ king , and has a different way of fin@@ ding out how to do life ."
"And if we take the lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m tr@@ en@@ ds of life , if we beg@@ in to say , what does ev@@ olution want ? There &apos;s se@@ ver@@ al things that we see ."
One of the things about ev@@ olution is that now@@ here on Earth have we ever been where we don &apos;t find life .
"We find life at the bot@@ tom of every lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m , lon@@ g@@ -@@ di@@ stance dri@@ l@@ ling cor@@ e into the cen@@ ter of ro@@ ck that we bring up — and there &apos;s bac@@ ter@@ ia in the po@@ res of that ro@@ ck ."
"And wh@@ er@@ ever life is , it never re@@ tre@@ ats . It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and it wan@@ ts to be more ."
M@@ ore and more of the in@@ er@@ t matter of the g@@ lo@@ be is being tou@@ ched and ani@@ mat@@ ed by life .
The second thing is is we see di@@ versity . We also see speci@@ aliz@@ ation .
We see the movement from a gener@@ al@@ -@@ pur@@ pos@@ e cell to the more speci@@ fic and speci@@ aliz@@ ed .
And we see a dri@@ ft towar@@ ds comple@@ x@@ ity that &apos;s very in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive .
"And actually , we have cur@@ r@@ ent data that does show that there is an ac@@ tu@@ al dri@@ ft towar@@ ds comple@@ x@@ ity over time ."
"And the last thing , I bring back this nu@@ di@@ bran@@ ch ."
One of the things we see about life is that it mo@@ ves from the in@@ ner to incre@@ as@@ ing so@@ ci@@ ability . And by that it means that there is more and more of life wh@@ ose entire environment is other life .
Li@@ ke those ch@@ lo@@ ro@@ pl@@ ast cells — they &apos;re completely sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by other life .
They never tou@@ ch the in@@ ner matter . There is more and more co@@ -@@ ev@@ olution .
"And so the gener@@ al , lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m tr@@ en@@ ds of ev@@ olution are rou@@ gh@@ ly these five : u@@ bi@@ qui@@ ty , di@@ versity , speci@@ aliz@@ ation , comple@@ x@@ ity and so@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ation . Now , I took that and said , OK , what are the lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m tr@@ en@@ ds in technology ?"
"And again , my question is , what does technology want ?"
"And so , re@@ mark@@ ably , I disco@@ vered that there &apos;s also a dri@@ ft tow@@ ard speci@@ aliz@@ ation ."
"That we see there &apos;s a gener@@ al ha@@ m@@ m@@ er , and ha@@ m@@ m@@ ers become more and more speci@@ fic over time ."
There &apos;s obvi@@ ously di@@ versity . H@@ u@@ ge num@@ bers of things .
This is all the cont@@ ents of a J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese home .
"I actually had my d@@ aughter — gave her a t@@ ally coun@@ ter , and I gave her an as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment last sum@@ m@@ er to go around and coun@@ t the number of species of technology in our hou@@ se@@ h@@ old ."
"And it came up with 6@@ ,000 different species of produ@@ cts ."
"I did some research and found out that the K@@ ing of En@@ gl@@ and , H@@ en@@ ry V@@ I@@ I@@ I , had only about 7@@ ,000 i@@ tem@@ s in his hou@@ se@@ h@@ old ."
"And he was the K@@ ing of En@@ gl@@ and , and that was the entire we@@ alth of En@@ gl@@ and at the time ."
So we &apos;re seeing huge num@@ bers of di@@ versity in the kinds of things .
This is a scen@@ e from St@@ ar W@@ ars where the 3@@ P@@ O comes out and he se@@ es mach@@ ines making mach@@ ines . How de@@ pra@@ ved !
"Well , this is actually what we &apos;re he@@ ad@@ ed towar@@ ds : world mach@@ ines ."
And the technology is only being th@@ row@@ n out by other technolog@@ ies .
"Mo@@ st mach@@ ines will only ever be in cont@@ act with other technology and not n@@ on-@@ technology , or even life ."
"And th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , the idea that mach@@ ines are be@@ coming biologi@@ cal and comple@@ x is at this point a cli@@ ch@@ e . And I &apos;m happy to say , I was par@@ tly respon@@ si@@ ble for that cli@@ ch@@ e that mach@@ ines are be@@ coming biologi@@ cal , but that &apos;s pretty evi@@ dent ."
"So the major tr@@ en@@ ds in technology ev@@ olution actually are the same as in biologi@@ cal ev@@ olution . The same dri@@ ves that we see towar@@ ds u@@ bi@@ qui@@ ty , towar@@ ds di@@ versity , towar@@ ds so@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ation , towar@@ ds comple@@ x@@ ity . That is maybe not a big sur@@ pri@@ se because if we ma@@ p out , say , the ev@@ olution of ar@@ mo@@ r , you can actually fol@@ low a sort of an ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ ty@@ pe cl@@ ad@@ i@@ stic t@@ ree ."
"I su@@ ggest that , in fact , technology is the se@@ ven@@ th k@@ ing@@ dom of life ."
That its oper@@ ations and how it works is so si@@ mi@@ lar that we can think of it as the se@@ ven@@ th k@@ ing@@ dom .
"And so it would be sort of appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately up there , coming out of the ani@@ mal k@@ ing@@ dom . And if we were to do that , we would find out — we could actually appro@@ ach technology in this way ."
This is Ni@@ les E@@ l@@ dre@@ dge . He was the co@@ -@@ develo@@ per with Ste@@ ph@@ en J@@ ay G@@ ould of the the@@ ory of pun@@ ctu@@ ated e@@ qui@@ li@@ bri@@ um .
"But as a si@@ de@@ line , he happens to colle@@ ct cor@@ ne@@ ts ."
He has one of the world &apos;s largest colle@@ ctions — about 500 of them .
"And he has decided to tre@@ at them as if they were tri@@ lo@@ bi@@ tes , or s@@ na@@ il@@ s , and to do a mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cal an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s , and try to der@@ i@@ ve their gen@@ e@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ cal history over time ."
"This is his char@@ t , which is not quite publi@@ shed yet ."
"But the most interesting aspe@@ ct about this is that if you look at those red lin@@ es at the bot@@ tom , those indi@@ cate basically a par@@ ent@@ age of a ty@@ pe of cor@@ net that was no longer made . That does not happen in bio@@ logy ."
"When something is ex@@ t@@ in@@ ct , you can &apos;t have it as your par@@ ent ."
"But that does happen in technology . And it turns out that that &apos;s so di@@ st@@ in@@ ctive that you can actually look at this t@@ ree , and you can actually use it to de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine that this is a technologi@@ cal system ver@@ su@@ s a biologi@@ cal system ."
"In fact , this idea of re@@ sur@@ re@@ cting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology ."
"And it turns out that , in fact , technolog@@ ies don &apos;t die ."
"So I su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed this to an histori@@ an of science , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , what about , you know , come on , what about ste@@ am cars ?"
"They &apos;re not around any@@ more . &quot; &quot; Well actually , they are ."
"In fact , they &apos;re so around that you can bu@@ y new par@@ ts for a St@@ an@@ ley ste@@ am au@@ tom@@ ob@@ ile ."
"And this is a we@@ b@@ site of a guy who &apos;s sel@@ ling br@@ and new par@@ ts for the St@@ an@@ ley au@@ tom@@ ob@@ ile . And the thing that I li@@ ked is sort of this one@@ -@@ cli@@ ck , ad@@ d-@@ to@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ car@@ t bu@@ t@@ ton — ( Laughter ) — for bu@@ ying ste@@ am val@@ ves . I mean , it was just — it was really there ."
"And so , I began to think about , well , maybe that &apos;s just a ran@@ dom sam@@ ple ."
Ma@@ ybe I should do this sort of in a more con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative way .
"So I took the great big 1@@ 8@@ 9@@ 5 M@@ on@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery W@@ ard &apos;s cat@@ al@@ o@@ g and I ran@@ dom@@ ly went through it . And I took a p@@ age — not quite a ran@@ dom p@@ age — I took a p@@ age that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the p@@ ages are fil@@ led with things that are still being made . But I took this p@@ age and I said , how many of these things are still being made ?"
And not anti@@ qu@@ es . I want to know how many of these things are still in produ@@ ction .
And the answer is : all of them .
All of them are still being produ@@ ced . So you &apos;ve got cor@@ n sh@@ el@@ l@@ ers .
I don &apos;t know who needs a cor@@ n sh@@ el@@ ler .
"B@@ e it cor@@ n sh@@ el@@ l@@ ers — you &apos;ve got pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ s ; you &apos;ve got f@@ an mi@@ l@@ ls ; all these things — and these are not , again , anti@@ qu@@ es . These are — you can order these . You can go to the we@@ b and you can bu@@ y them now , bran@@ d-@@ new made . So in a certain sense , technolog@@ ies don &apos;t die ."
"In fact , you can bu@@ y , for 50 bu@@ cks , a st@@ one@@ -@@ age k@@ ni@@ fe made exactly the same way that they were made 1@@ 0,000 years ago ."
"It &apos;s shor@@ t , b@@ one hand@@ le , 50 bu@@ cks . And in fact , what &apos;s important is that this information actually never d@@ ied out ."
It &apos;s not just that it was re@@ sur@@ re@@ cted . It &apos;s contin@@ u@@ ed all along .
"And in P@@ a@@ pu@@ a New G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a , they were making st@@ one ax@@ es until two de@@ ca@@ des ago , just as a course of prac@@ tical mat@@ ters ."
"E@@ ven when we try to get ri@@ d of a technology , it &apos;s actually very hard ."
So we &apos;ve all heard about the A@@ mi@@ sh gi@@ ving up cars .
We &apos;ve heard about the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese gi@@ ving up g@@ un@@ s .
"We &apos;ve heard about this and that . But I actually went back and took what I could find , the exam@@ ples in history where there have been pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions against technology , and then I tr@@ ied to find out when they came back in , because they always came back in . And it turns out that the time , the du@@ r@@ ation of when they were out@@ l@@ aw@@ ed and pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ ted , is de@@ cre@@ as@@ ing over time . And that basically , you can de@@ l@@ ay technology , but you can &apos;t ki@@ ll it . So this makes sense , because in a certain sense what culture is , is the ac@@ cu@@ mul@@ ation of ideas ."
That &apos;s what it &apos;s for . It &apos;s so that ideas don &apos;t die out .
"And when we take that , we take this idea of what culture is doing and ad@@ d it to what the lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory — again , in life &apos;s ev@@ olution — we find that each case — each of the major tran@@ si@@ tions in life — what they &apos;re really about is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating and chang@@ ing the way in which ev@@ olution happens ."
They &apos;re actually chang@@ ing the way in which ideas are gener@@ ated .
"So all these ste@@ ps in ev@@ olution are incre@@ as@@ ing , basically , the ev@@ olution of ev@@ ol@@ v@@ ability ."
"So what &apos;s happening over time in life is that the ways in which you gener@@ ate these new ideas , these new h@@ ac@@ ks , are incre@@ as@@ ing . And the real tri@@ cks are ways in which you kind of expl@@ ore the way of expl@@ or@@ ing ."
"And then what we see in the sin@@ gu@@ lar@@ ity , that pro@@ p@@ he@@ si@@ zed by K@@ u@@ rz@@ we@@ il and others — his idea that technology is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating ev@@ olution ."
It &apos;s ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating the way in which we sear@@ ch for ideas .
"So if you have life h@@ ac@@ king — life means h@@ ac@@ king , the g@@ ame of survi@@ v@@ al — then ev@@ olution is a way to ex@@ ten@@ d the g@@ ame by chang@@ ing the ru@@ les of the g@@ ame ."
And what technology is really about is better ways to ev@@ ol@@ ve .
"That is what we call an &quot; &quot; in@@ fini@@ te g@@ ame . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the defini@@ tion of &quot; &quot; in@@ fini@@ te g@@ ame . &quot; &quot; A fini@@ te g@@ ame is play to wi@@ n , and an in@@ fini@@ te g@@ ame is pla@@ yed to keep playing ."
And I believe that technology is actually a co@@ smi@@ c force .
"The ori@@ gin@@ s of technology was not in 1@@ 8@@ 2@@ 9 , but was actually at the beginning of the Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g , and at that moment the entire huge bi@@ llions of star@@ s in the universe were com@@ pres@@ sed . The entire universe was com@@ pres@@ sed into a little qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m do@@ t , and it was so ti@@ ght in there , there was no room for any difference at all ."
That &apos;s the defini@@ tion . There was no temper@@ ature .
"There was no difference wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever . And at the Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ g , what it ex@@ pan@@ ded was the poten@@ tial for difference ."
"So as it ex@@ p@@ ands and as things ex@@ p@@ and what we have is the poten@@ tial for differ@@ ences , di@@ versity , op@@ tions , cho@@ i@@ ces , opportuni@@ ties , possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies and fre@@ ed@@ oms ."
Th@@ ose are all basically the same thing .
And those are the things that technology br@@ ings us .
"That &apos;s what technology is br@@ ing@@ ing us : cho@@ i@@ ces , possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies , fre@@ ed@@ oms ."
That &apos;s what it &apos;s about . It &apos;s this ex@@ pan@@ sion of room to make differ@@ ences .
"And so a ha@@ m@@ m@@ er , when we gra@@ b a ha@@ m@@ m@@ er , that &apos;s what we &apos;re gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing ."
And that &apos;s why we contin@@ ue to gra@@ b technology — because we want those things . Th@@ ose things are good .
"D@@ i@@ f@@ fer@@ ences , fre@@ e@@ dom , cho@@ i@@ ces , possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies ."
"And each time we make a new opportunity place , we &apos;re allow@@ ing a pl@@ at@@ form to make new ones ."
And I think it &apos;s really important . Because if you can imagine Mo@@ zar@@ t before the technology of the pi@@ ano was inv@@ en@@ ted — what a lo@@ ss to society there would be .
I@@ mag@@ ine V@@ an G@@ og@@ h being born before the technolog@@ ies of che@@ a@@ p oil pain@@ ts .
I@@ mag@@ ine H@@ it@@ ch@@ co@@ ck before the technolog@@ ies of film .
"S@@ ome@@ where , today , there are mi@@ llions of young children being born wh@@ ose technology of self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion has not yet been inv@@ en@@ ted ."
We have a mor@@ al ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation to inv@@ ent technology so that every person on the g@@ lo@@ be has the poten@@ tial to realize their true difference .
We want a tri@@ llion z@@ il@@ li@@ on species of one individu@@ als .
That &apos;s what technology really wan@@ ts .
I &apos;m going to sk@@ i@@ p through some of the obje@@ ctions because I don &apos;t have ans@@ w@@ ers to why there &apos;s de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation .
"I don &apos;t have an answer to the fact that there se@@ em to be bad technolog@@ ies . I don &apos;t have an answer to how this impac@@ ts on our di@@ gni@@ ty , other than to su@@ ggest that maybe the se@@ ven@@ th k@@ ing@@ dom , because it &apos;s so close to what life is about , maybe we can bring it back and have it help us mon@@ it@@ or life ."
Ma@@ ybe in some ways the fact that what we &apos;re trying to do with technology is find a good home for it .
"It &apos;s a terri@@ ble thing to spra@@ y D@@ D@@ T on c@@ ot@@ ton fie@@ l@@ ds , but it &apos;s a really good thing to use to e@@ li@@ min@@ ate mi@@ llions of c@@ ases of death du@@ e to mal@@ ar@@ ia in a small vi@@ ll@@ age ."
O@@ ur hum@@ ani@@ ty is actually de@@ fin@@ ed by technology .
All the things that we think that we really like about hum@@ ani@@ ty is being dri@@ ven by technology . This is the in@@ fini@@ te g@@ ame .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
"You see , technology is a way to ev@@ ol@@ ve the ev@@ olution ."
It &apos;s a way to expl@@ ore possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies and opportuni@@ ties and create more .
"And it &apos;s actually a way of playing the g@@ ame , of playing all the g@@ am@@ es ."
That &apos;s what technology wan@@ ts .
"And so when I think about what technology wan@@ ts , I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here — and I really believe this — every person here has an as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment . And your as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment is to spend your life disco@@ ver@@ ing what your as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment is ."
That re@@ cur@@ sive nature is the in@@ fini@@ te g@@ ame .
"And if you play that well , you &apos;ll have other people inv@@ olved , so even that g@@ ame ex@@ ten@@ ds and contin@@ u@@ es even when you &apos;re gone ."
That is the in@@ fini@@ te g@@ ame . And what technology is is the medi@@ um in which we play that in@@ fini@@ te g@@ ame .
And so I think that we should em@@ brac@@ e technology because it is an essen@@ tial part of our jour@@ ney in fin@@ ding out who we are .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Ha@@ wa A@@ b@@ d@@ i : M@@ any people — 20 years for S@@ om@@ ali@@ a — &#91; were &#93; fi@@ gh@@ ting .
"So there was no job , no food ."
"Ch@@ il@@ dren , most of them , became very mal@@ n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shed , like this ."
"D@@ e@@ q@@ o Mo@@ ha@@ med : So as you know , always in a ci@@ vi@@ l war , the ones af@@ fe@@ cted most &#91; are &#93; the women and children ."
So our patients are women and children .
And they are in our back@@ y@@ ard .
It &apos;s our home . We wel@@ come them .
"That &apos;s the cam@@ p that we have in now 9@@ 0,000 people , where 7@@ 5 percent of them are women and children ."
P@@ at M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell : And this is your ho@@ spit@@ al . This is the inside .
H@@ A : We are doing C@@ -@@ se@@ ctions and different oper@@ ations because people need some help .
There is no government to prote@@ ct them .
"D@@ M : E@@ very morning we have about 4@@ 00 patients , maybe more or less ."
"But sometimes we are only five do@@ ct@@ ors and 16 n@@ ur@@ ses , and we are physi@@ cally getting ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ed to see all of them ."
"But we take the se@@ v@@ ere ones , and we re@@ s@@ che@@ du@@ le the other ones the next day ."
It is very t@@ ough .
"And as you can see , it &apos;s the women who are car@@ ry@@ ing the children ; it &apos;s the women who come into the ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s ; it &apos;s the women &#91; are &#93; building the h@@ ous@@ es ."
That &apos;s their house .
"And we have a school . This is our b@@ right — we open@@ ed &#91; in the &#93; last two years &#91; an &#93; ele@@ ment@@ ary school where we have 8@@ 50 children , and the maj@@ ori@@ ty are women and girls ."
( Applause ) P@@ M : And the do@@ ct@@ ors have some very big ru@@ les about who can get tre@@ ated at the c@@ lin@@ ic .
W@@ ould you expla@@ in the ru@@ les for ad@@ mis@@ sion ?
"H@@ A : The people who are coming to us , we are wel@@ coming ."
We are sh@@ aring with them whatever we have .
But there are only two ru@@ les .
F@@ ir@@ st ru@@ le : there is no cl@@ an di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ i@@ shed and poli@@ tical di@@ vision in S@@ om@@ ali society .
&#91; Wh@@ om@@ ever &#93; makes those things we th@@ row out .
The second : no man can be@@ at his wi@@ fe .
"If he be@@ at , we will put &#91; him &#93; in ja@@ il , and we will call the el@@ d@@ est people ."
"U@@ n@@ til they iden@@ ti@@ fy this case , we &apos;ll never rele@@ ase him ."
That &apos;s our two ru@@ les .
"( Applause ) The other thing that I have realized , that the woman is the most stron@@ g person all over the world ."
"Because the last 20 years , the S@@ om@@ ali woman has sto@@ od up ."
"They were the le@@ ad@@ ers , and we are the le@@ ad@@ ers of our community and the hope of our future gener@@ ations ."
We are not just the hel@@ pl@@ ess and the vi@@ cti@@ ms of the ci@@ vi@@ l war .
We can re@@ con@@ ci@@ le .
We can do everything .
"( Applause ) D@@ M : A@@ s my mother said , we are the future hope , and the men are only kil@@ ling in S@@ om@@ ali@@ a ."
So we came up with these two ru@@ les .
"In a cam@@ p with 9@@ 0,000 people , you have to come up with some ru@@ les or there is going to be some fi@@ ghts ."
"So there is no cl@@ an di@@ vision , and no man can be@@ at his wi@@ fe ."
And we have a little stor@@ age room where we con@@ ver@@ ted a ja@@ il .
"So if you be@@ at your wi@@ fe , you &apos;re going to be there ."
( Applause ) So em@@ power@@ ing the women and gi@@ ving the opportunity — we are there for them . They are not alone for this .
P@@ M : You &apos;re ru@@ n@@ ning a medi@@ cal c@@ lin@@ ic .
"It brought much , much needed medi@@ cal care to people who wouldn &apos;t get it ."
You &apos;re also ru@@ n@@ ning a ci@@ vi@@ l society .
"You &apos;ve created your own ru@@ les , in which women and children are getting a different sense of secu@@ ri@@ ty ."
"T@@ al@@ k to me about your deci@@ sion , D@@ r. A@@ b@@ d@@ i , and your deci@@ sion , D@@ r. Mo@@ ha@@ med , to work together — for you to become a do@@ ctor and to work with your mother in these cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces ."
"H@@ A : My age — because I was born in 19@@ 4@@ 7 — we were having , at that time , government , la@@ w and order ."
"But one day , I went to the ho@@ spit@@ al — my mother was si@@ ck — and I saw the ho@@ spit@@ al , how they &#91; were &#93; tre@@ ating the do@@ ct@@ ors , how they &#91; are &#93; com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted to help the si@@ ck people ."
"I ad@@ mi@@ red them , and I decided to become a do@@ ctor ."
"My mother d@@ ied , un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , when I was 12 years &#91; old &#93; ."
Th@@ en my father allow@@ ed me to pro@@ ce@@ ed &#91; with &#93; my hope .
"My mother d@@ ied in &#91; a &#93; g@@ y@@ ne@@ co@@ logy comp@@ lic@@ ation , so I decided to become a g@@ y@@ ne@@ co@@ logy speci@@ ali@@ st ."
That &apos;s why I became a do@@ ctor .
So D@@ r. De@@ q@@ o has to expla@@ in .
"D@@ M : F@@ or me , my mother was pre@@ par@@ ing &#91; me &#93; when I was a child to become a do@@ ctor , but I really didn &apos;t want to ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe I should become an histori@@ an , or maybe a re@@ por@@ ter ."
"I lo@@ ved it , but it didn &apos;t work ."
"When the war bro@@ ke out — ci@@ vi@@ l war — I saw how my mother was hel@@ ping and how she really needed the help , and how the care is essen@@ tial to the woman to be a woman do@@ ctor in S@@ om@@ ali@@ a and help the women and children ."
"And I thought , maybe I can be a re@@ por@@ ter and do@@ ctor g@@ y@@ ne@@ co@@ logi@@ st ."
"( Laughter ) So I went to R@@ us@@ si@@ a , and my mother also , &#91; during the &#93; time of &#91; the &#93; S@@ o@@ vie@@ t Uni@@ on ."
"So some of our char@@ ac@@ ter , maybe we will come with a stron@@ g S@@ o@@ vie@@ t back@@ ground of tra@@ ining ."
So that &apos;s how I decided &#91; to do &#93; the same .
My si@@ ster was different .
She &apos;s here . She &apos;s also a do@@ ctor .
She gra@@ du@@ ated in R@@ us@@ si@@ a also .
"( Applause ) And to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the ci@@ vi@@ l war — when I was 16 , and my si@@ ster was 11 , when the ci@@ vi@@ l war bro@@ ke out ."
So it was the need and the people we saw in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s — that &apos;s what made us go back and work for them .
"P@@ M : So what is the bi@@ ggest challen@@ ge working , mother and d@@ aughter , in such d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous and sometimes sc@@ ary situ@@ ations ?"
"H@@ A : Yes , I was working in a t@@ ough situ@@ ation , very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ."
"And when I saw the people who needed me , I was sta@@ ying with them to help , because I &#91; could &#93; do something for them ."
Mo@@ st people f@@ led ab@@ ro@@ ad .
"But I re@@ ma@@ ined with those people , and I was trying to do something — &#91; any &#93; little thing I &#91; could &#93; do ."
I suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed in my place .
"Now my place is 9@@ 0,000 people who are re@@ spe@@ cting each other , who are not fi@@ gh@@ ting ."
"But we try to stand on our fe@@ et , to do something , little things , we can for our people ."
And I &apos;m th@@ an@@ k@@ ful for my d@@ augh@@ ters .
"When they come to me , they help me to tre@@ at the people , to help ."
They do everything for them .
They have done what I de@@ si@@ re to do for them .
"P@@ M : What &apos;s the best part of working with your mother , and the most challen@@ g@@ ing part for you ?"
D@@ M : She &apos;s very t@@ ough ; it &apos;s most challen@@ g@@ ing .
She always expe@@ cts us to do more .
"And really when you think &#91; you &#93; cannot do it , she will p@@ us@@ h you , and I can do it ."
That &apos;s the best part .
"S@@ he shows us , tra@@ ins us how to do and how to be better &#91; people &#93; and how to do long hours in sur@@ g@@ ery — 3@@ 00 patients per day , 10 , 20 sur@@ ger@@ ies , and still you have to man@@ age the cam@@ p — that &apos;s how she tra@@ ins us ."
"It is not like beautiful offi@@ ces here , 20 patients , you &apos;re ti@@ red ."
"You see 3@@ 00 patients , 20 sur@@ ger@@ ies and 9@@ 0,000 people to man@@ age ."
P@@ M : But you do it for good reas@@ ons .
( Applause ) W@@ a@@ it . W@@ a@@ it .
H@@ A : Thank you .
D@@ M : Thank you .
( Applause ) H@@ A : Thank you very much . D@@ M : Thank you very much .
I have a question for you : A@@ re you religi@@ ous ?
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religi@@ ous person .
"L@@ et &apos;s see , I &apos;d say about three or four percent ."
I had no idea there were so many belie@@ ver@@ s at a TED Con@@ fer@@ ence .
"( Laughter ) O@@ kay , here &apos;s another question : Do you think of yourself as spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al in any way , sha@@ pe or form ? R@@ a@@ ise your hand ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s the maj@@ ori@@ ty ."
"My T@@ al@@ k today is about the ma@@ in reason , or one of the ma@@ in reas@@ ons , why most people consi@@ der themselves to be spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al in some way , sha@@ pe or form ."
My T@@ al@@ k today is about self-@@ tran@@ scen@@ dence .
It &apos;s just a basi@@ c fact about being human that sometimes the self seem@@ s to just me@@ l@@ t away .
"And when that happens , the feeling is e@@ c@@ st@@ atic and we re@@ ach for me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ors of up and down to expla@@ in these feel@@ ings ."
We talk about being up@@ li@@ f@@ ted or ele@@ v@@ ated .
Now it &apos;s really hard to think about anything ab@@ strac@@ t like this without a good con@@ cre@@ te me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or .
So here &apos;s the me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or I &apos;m of@@ fer@@ ing today .
"Th@@ in@@ k about the mind as being like a house with many ro@@ oms , most of which we &apos;re very fami@@ li@@ ar with ."
But sometimes it &apos;s as though a do@@ or@@ way ap@@ pe@@ ars from out of now@@ here and it open@@ s on@@ to a sta@@ ir@@ case .
We clim@@ b the sta@@ ir@@ case and experience a state of alter@@ ed con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness .
"In 19@@ 0@@ 2 , the great American psycho@@ logi@@ st W@@ il@@ li@@ am J@@ am@@ es wro@@ te about the many v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties of religi@@ ous experience ."
He colle@@ cted all kinds of case stud@@ ies .
He quot@@ ed the words of all kinds of people who &apos;d had a v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of these exper@@ ien@@ ces .
"One of the most exci@@ ting to me is this young man , Ste@@ ph@@ en Bra@@ d@@ ley , had an en@@ coun@@ ter , he thought , with J@@ es@@ us in 1@@ 8@@ 20 ."
And here &apos;s what Bra@@ d@@ ley said about it .
"( Music ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) Ste@@ ph@@ en Bra@@ d@@ ley : I thought I saw the sa@@ vi@@ or in human sha@@ pe for about one second in the room , with ar@@ ms ex@@ ten@@ ded , ap@@ pe@@ aring to say to me , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome . &quot; &quot; The next day I re@@ jo@@ i@@ ced with tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling ."
My happ@@ iness was so great that I said I wanted to die .
This world had no place in my af@@ fe@@ ctions .
"P@@ re@@ vi@@ ous to this time , I was very sel@@ fish and self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous ."
"But now I de@@ si@@ red the wel@@ f@@ are of all man@@ kind and could , with a feeling heart , for@@ give my wor@@ st ene@@ mie@@ s ."
"J@@ H : So not@@ e how Bra@@ d@@ ley &apos;s pe@@ t@@ ty , mor@@ ali@@ stic self just d@@ ies on the way up the sta@@ ir@@ case ."
And on this high@@ er level he be@@ comes lo@@ ving and for@@ gi@@ ving .
The world &apos;s many religi@@ ons have found so many ways to help people clim@@ b the sta@@ ir@@ case .
S@@ ome sh@@ u@@ t down the self using medi@@ tation .
O@@ thers use psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c dru@@ gs .
This is from a 1@@ 6@@ th century A@@ z@@ te@@ c sc@@ ro@@ ll show@@ ing a man about to e@@ at a p@@ si@@ lo@@ cy@@ b@@ in mus@@ h@@ room and at the same moment get y@@ an@@ ked up the sta@@ ir@@ case by a go@@ d .
"O@@ thers use dan@@ cing , sp@@ in@@ ning and cir@@ c@@ ling to pro@@ mot@@ e self-@@ tran@@ scen@@ dence ."
But you don &apos;t need a religi@@ on to get you through the sta@@ ir@@ case .
L@@ ots of people find self-@@ tran@@ scen@@ dence in nature .
O@@ thers over@@ come their self at ra@@ ves .
But here &apos;s the we@@ ir@@ d@@ est place of all : war .
"So many boo@@ ks about war say the same thing , that nothing br@@ ings people together like war ."
And that br@@ ing@@ ing them together open@@ s up the possi@@ bility of ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary self-@@ tran@@ scen@@ dent exper@@ ien@@ ces .
I &apos;m going to play for you an ex@@ cer@@ pt from this book by G@@ len@@ n G@@ ra@@ y .
G@@ ra@@ y was a sol@@ d@@ ier in the American ar@@ my in World W@@ ar I@@ I .
And after the war he inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ed a lot of other sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s and wro@@ te about the experience of men in bat@@ tle .
Here &apos;s a key pas@@ s@@ age where he basically descri@@ be@@ s the sta@@ ir@@ case .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) G@@ len@@ n G@@ ra@@ y : M@@ any ve@@ ter@@ ans will ad@@ m@@ it that the experience of com@@ mu@@ na@@ l ef@@ for@@ t in bat@@ tle has been the high point of their lives .
"&quot; I &quot; pas@@ ses in@@ sen@@ si@@ bly into a &quot; we , &quot; &quot; my &quot; be@@ comes &quot; our &quot; and individu@@ al fai@@ th lo@@ ses its cent@@ ral import@@ ance ."
I believe that it is nothing less than the as@@ su@@ ran@@ ce of im@@ mor@@ t@@ ality that makes self-@@ s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce at these mom@@ ents so relati@@ vely e@@ asy .
"I may f@@ all , but I do not die , for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the com@@ ra@@ des for wh@@ om I gave up my life ."
"J@@ H : So what all of these c@@ ases have in common is that the self seem@@ s to th@@ in out , or me@@ l@@ t away , and it feel@@ s good , it feel@@ s really good , in a way tot@@ ally un@@ like anything we feel in our nor@@ mal lives ."
It feel@@ s some@@ how up@@ li@@ f@@ ting .
This idea that we move up was cent@@ ral in the writing of the great F@@ ren@@ ch so@@ ci@@ ologi@@ st E@@ mi@@ le D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ im .
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ im even called us H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x , or two@@ -@@ level man ."
The low@@ er level he called the level of the prof@@ ane .
Now prof@@ ane is the op@@ posi@@ te of s@@ ac@@ red .
It just means ordin@@ ary or common .
And in our ordin@@ ary lives we exi@@ st as individu@@ als .
We want to s@@ ati@@ s@@ fy our individu@@ al de@@ si@@ res .
We pur@@ su@@ e our individu@@ al go@@ als .
But sometimes something happens that tri@@ gg@@ ers a p@@ ha@@ se change .
"In@@ di@@ vidu@@ als uni@@ te into a team , a movement or a n@@ ation , which is far more than the su@@ m of its par@@ ts ."
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ im called this level the level of the s@@ ac@@ red because he belie@@ ved that the fun@@ ction of religi@@ on was to uni@@ te people into a group , into a mor@@ al community ."
D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ im belie@@ ved that anything that uni@@ tes us takes on an air of s@@ ac@@ re@@ d@@ ness .
"And once people cir@@ cle around some s@@ ac@@ red obje@@ ct or val@@ ue , they &apos;ll then work as a team and fi@@ ght to def@@ end it ."
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ im wro@@ te about a set of inten@@ se colle@@ ctive emoti@@ ons that ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh this mi@@ rac@@ le of E p@@ lu@@ ri@@ bu@@ s un@@ um , of making a group out of individu@@ als ."
Th@@ in@@ k of the colle@@ ctive jo@@ y in Bri@@ tain on the day World W@@ ar I@@ I en@@ ded .
"Th@@ in@@ k of the colle@@ ctive ang@@ er in T@@ a@@ h@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are , which brought down a di@@ ct@@ ator ."
"And think of the colle@@ ctive gr@@ ie@@ f in the United States that we all felt , that brought us all together , after 9 / 11 ."
So let me sum@@ mar@@ i@@ ze where we are .
I &apos;m saying that the ca@@ pac@@ ity for self-@@ tran@@ scen@@ dence is just a basi@@ c part of being human .
I &apos;m of@@ fer@@ ing the me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or of a sta@@ ir@@ case in the mind .
I &apos;m saying we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x and this sta@@ ir@@ case takes us up from the prof@@ ane level to the level of the s@@ ac@@ red .
"When we clim@@ b that sta@@ ir@@ case , self-@@ inter@@ est fa@@ des away , we become just much less self-@@ interested , and we feel as though we are better , no@@ b@@ ler and some@@ how up@@ li@@ f@@ ted ."
So here &apos;s the mi@@ lli@@ on-@@ dol@@ lar question for social scienti@@ sts like me : Is the sta@@ ir@@ case a fe@@ ature of our ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary design ?
"I@@ s it a produ@@ ct of natural se@@ le@@ ction , like our h@@ ands ?"
"O@@ r is it a bu@@ g , a mist@@ ake in the system — this religi@@ ous stuff is just something that happens when the wi@@ res c@@ ross in the brain — J@@ i@@ ll has a stro@@ ke and she has this religi@@ ous experience , it &apos;s just a mist@@ ake ?"
Well many scienti@@ sts who study religi@@ on take this view .
"The New A@@ the@@ ist@@ s , for example , ar@@ gu@@ e that religi@@ on is a set of me@@ mes , sort of par@@ a@@ si@@ tic me@@ mes , that get inside our min@@ ds and make us do all kinds of c@@ razy religi@@ ous stuff , self-@@ de@@ stru@@ ctive stuff , like su@@ i@@ ci@@ de b@@ om@@ b@@ ing ."
"And after all , how could it ever be good for us to lo@@ se ourselves ?"
How could it ever be ad@@ ap@@ tive for any organi@@ sm to over@@ come self-@@ inter@@ est ?
Well let me show you .
"In &quot; &quot; The D@@ es@@ cent of M@@ an , &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n wro@@ te a great deal about the ev@@ olution of mor@@ ality — where did it come from , why do we have it ."
"D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n not@@ ed that many of our vi@@ r@@ tu@@ es are of very little use to ourselves , but they &apos;re of great use to our grou@@ ps ."
He wro@@ te about the scen@@ ari@@ o in which two tri@@ be@@ s of early hum@@ ans would have come in cont@@ act and compe@@ ti@@ tion .
"He said , &quot; &quot; If the one tri@@ be inclu@@ ded a great number of cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous , sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic and fai@@ th@@ ful mem@@ bers who are always ready to a@@ id and def@@ end each other , this tri@@ be would suc@@ ce@@ ed better and con@@ qu@@ er the other . &quot; &quot; He went on to say that &quot; &quot; S@@ el@@ fish and con@@ ten@@ ti@@ ous people will not co@@ here , and without co@@ her@@ ence nothing can be effe@@ cted . &quot; &quot; In other words , Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n belie@@ ved in group se@@ le@@ ction ."
"Now this idea has been very contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al for the last 40 years , but it &apos;s about to make a major com@@ e@@ back this year , es@@ pe@@ cially after E@@ .@@ O@@ . W@@ il@@ son &apos;s book comes out in Ap@@ ri@@ l , making a very stron@@ g case that we , and se@@ ver@@ al other species , are produ@@ cts of group se@@ le@@ ction ."
But really the way to think about this is as mul@@ ti@@ level se@@ le@@ ction .
So look at it this way : You &apos;ve got compe@@ ti@@ tion going on within grou@@ ps and across grou@@ ps .
So here &apos;s a group of guys on a colle@@ ge cre@@ w team .
Wi@@ th@@ in this team there &apos;s compe@@ ti@@ tion .
There are guys compe@@ ting with each other .
"The s@@ low@@ est row@@ ers , the we@@ ak@@ est row@@ ers , are going to get cut from the team ."
And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the spor@@ t .
Ma@@ ybe one of them will make it to the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ cs .
"So within the team , their interest@@ s are actually pit@@ ted against each other ."
And sometimes it would be adv@@ an@@ t@@ ag@@ e@@ ous for one of these guys to try to s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age the other guys .
Ma@@ ybe he &apos;ll bad@@ m@@ outh his ch@@ ie@@ f ri@@ v@@ al to the co@@ ach .
"But while that compe@@ ti@@ tion is going on within the boat , this compe@@ ti@@ tion is going on across bo@@ ats ."
"And once you put these guys in a boat compe@@ ting with another boat , now they &apos;ve got no cho@@ ice but to co@@ oper@@ ate because they &apos;re all in the same boat ."
They can only wi@@ n if they all pu@@ ll together as a team .
"I mean , these things sound tri@@ te , but they are de@@ ep ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary tru@@ ths ."
"The ma@@ in ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent against group se@@ le@@ ction has always been that , well sure , it would be nice to have a group of co@@ oper@@ at@@ ors , but as so@@ on as you have a group of co@@ oper@@ at@@ ors , they &apos;re just going to get taken over by fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ ders , individu@@ als that are going to ex@@ plo@@ it the hard work of the others ."
Let me il@@ lu@@ str@@ ate this for you .
"S@@ up@@ pos@@ e we &apos;ve got a group of little organi@@ s@@ ms — they can be bac@@ ter@@ ia , they can be ha@@ m@@ st@@ ers ; it doesn &apos;t matter what — and let &apos;s sup@@ pos@@ e that this little group here , they ev@@ olved to be co@@ oper@@ ative ."
"Well that &apos;s great . They gra@@ ze , they def@@ end each other , they work together , they gener@@ ate we@@ alth ."
"And as you &apos;ll see in this si@@ mul@@ ation , as they inter@@ act they ga@@ in poin@@ ts , as it were , they gro@@ w , and when they &apos;ve d@@ ou@@ b@@ led in size , you &apos;ll see them sp@@ li@@ t , and that &apos;s how they re@@ produ@@ ce and the popul@@ ation grow@@ s ."
But sup@@ pos@@ e then that one of them mu@@ t@@ ates .
There &apos;s a mu@@ tation in the gen@@ e and one of them mu@@ t@@ ates to fol@@ low a sel@@ fish strate@@ gy .
It takes adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of the others .
"And so when a green inter@@ ac@@ ts with a blue , you &apos;ll see the green gets lar@@ ger and the blue gets s@@ mal@@ ler ."
So here &apos;s how things play out .
"We start with just one green , and as it inter@@ ac@@ ts it ga@@ ins we@@ alth or poin@@ ts or food ."
"And in shor@@ t order , the co@@ oper@@ at@@ ors are done for ."
The fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ ders have taken over .
If a group cannot sol@@ ve the fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ der problem then it cannot re@@ a@@ p the b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts of co@@ oper@@ ation and group se@@ le@@ ction cannot get started .
But there are solu@@ tions to the fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ der problem .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
"In fact , nature has sol@@ ved it many , many times ."
And nature &apos;s fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te solution is to put everyone in the same boat .
"For example , why is it that the mi@@ to@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ a in every cell has its own DNA , tot@@ ally se@@ par@@ ate from the DNA in the nu@@ cle@@ us ?"
It &apos;s because they used to be se@@ par@@ ate fre@@ e-@@ living bac@@ ter@@ ia and they came together and became a super@@ organi@@ sm .
"S@@ ome@@ how or other — maybe one s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed another ; we &apos;ll never know exactly why — but once they got a mem@@ br@@ ane around them , they were all in the same mem@@ br@@ ane , now all the we@@ al@@ th@@ -@@ created di@@ vision of lab@@ or , all the gre@@ at@@ ness created by co@@ oper@@ ation , sta@@ ys lo@@ cked inside the mem@@ br@@ ane and we &apos;ve got a super@@ organi@@ sm ."
"And now let &apos;s r@@ er@@ u@@ n the si@@ mul@@ ation pu@@ tting one of these super@@ organi@@ s@@ ms into a popul@@ ation of fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ ders , of de@@ fe@@ ct@@ ors , of che@@ at@@ ers and look what happens ."
A super@@ organi@@ sm can basically take what it wan@@ ts .
"It &apos;s so big and powerful and ef@@ fi@@ cient that it can take re@@ sources from the gre@@ ens , from the de@@ fe@@ ct@@ ors , the che@@ at@@ ers ."
And pretty so@@ on the whole popul@@ ation is actually com@@ posed of these new super@@ organi@@ s@@ ms .
What I &apos;ve sh@@ own you here is sometimes called a major tran@@ si@@ tion in ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary history .
"D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n &apos;s l@@ aw@@ s don &apos;t change , but now there &apos;s a new kind of pla@@ y@@ er on the fie@@ ld and things beg@@ in to look very different ."
Now this tran@@ si@@ tion was not a one@@ -@@ time fre@@ ak of nature that just happened with some bac@@ ter@@ ia .
"It happened again about 1@@ 20 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some so@@ lit@@ ary wa@@ sp@@ s began cre@@ ating little simple , pri@@ mi@@ tive ne@@ sts , or hi@@ ves ."
"O@@ n@@ ce se@@ ver@@ al wa@@ sp@@ s were all together in the same hi@@ ve , they had no cho@@ ice but to co@@ oper@@ ate , because pretty so@@ on they were lo@@ cked into compe@@ ti@@ tion with other hi@@ ves ."
"And the most co@@ he@@ sive hi@@ ves won , just as D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n said ."
These early wa@@ sp@@ s gave ri@@ se to the bees and the an@@ ts that have co@@ vered the world and changed the bio@@ sp@@ here .
"And it happened again , even more spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ u@@ lar@@ ly , in the last hal@@ f-@@ million years when our own an@@ c@@ est@@ ors became cul@@ tu@@ ral cre@@ at@@ ures , they came together around a hear@@ th or a cam@@ p@@ fi@@ re , they di@@ vi@@ ded lab@@ or , they began pain@@ ting their bod@@ ies , they spo@@ ke their own di@@ ale@@ cts , and ev@@ en@@ tually they wor@@ shi@@ ped their own god@@ s ."
"O@@ n@@ ce they were all in the same tri@@ be , they could keep the b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts of co@@ oper@@ ation lo@@ cked inside ."
"And they un@@ lo@@ cked the most powerful force ever known on this planet , which is human co@@ oper@@ ation — a force for con@@ stru@@ ction and de@@ stru@@ ction ."
"O@@ f course , human grou@@ ps are now@@ here ne@@ ar as co@@ he@@ sive as be@@ e@@ hi@@ ves ."
"H@@ um@@ an grou@@ ps may look like hi@@ ves for br@@ ie@@ f mom@@ ents , but they ten@@ d to then bre@@ ak a@@ part ."
We &apos;re not lo@@ cked into co@@ oper@@ ation the way bees and an@@ ts are .
"In fact , often , as we &apos;ve seen happen in a lot of the A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing re@@ vol@@ ts , often those di@@ vi@@ sions are along religi@@ ous lin@@ es ."
"N@@ one@@ the@@ less , when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement , they can move m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ."
L@@ ook at the people in these ph@@ ot@@ os I &apos;ve been show@@ ing you .
Do you think they &apos;re there pur@@ su@@ ing their self-@@ inter@@ est ?
"O@@ r are they pur@@ su@@ ing com@@ mu@@ na@@ l inter@@ est , which requi@@ res them to lo@@ se themselves and become simply a part of a whole ?"
"O@@ kay , so that was my T@@ al@@ k deli@@ vered in the stan@@ d@@ ard TED way ."
And now I &apos;m going to give the whole T@@ al@@ k over again in three minutes in a more fu@@ ll@@ -@@ spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m sort of way .
"( Music ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) J@@ on@@ a@@ than Ha@@ i@@ d@@ t : We hum@@ ans have many v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties of religi@@ ous experience , as W@@ il@@ li@@ am J@@ am@@ es expla@@ ined ."
One of the most common is clim@@ b@@ ing the se@@ cre@@ t sta@@ ir@@ case and lo@@ sing ourselves .
"The sta@@ ir@@ case takes us from the experience of life as prof@@ ane or ordin@@ ary up@@ war@@ ds to the experience of life as s@@ ac@@ red , or de@@ e@@ ply inter@@ conne@@ cted ."
"We are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x , as D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ im expla@@ ined ."
"And we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x because we ev@@ olved by mul@@ ti@@ level se@@ le@@ ction , as D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n expla@@ ined ."
"I can &apos;t be certain if the sta@@ ir@@ case is an ad@@ ap@@ tation rather than a bu@@ g , but if it is an ad@@ ap@@ tation , then the im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations are pro@@ found ."
"If it is an ad@@ ap@@ tation , then we ev@@ olved to be religi@@ ous ."
I don &apos;t mean that we ev@@ olved to jo@@ in gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic organiz@@ ed religi@@ ons .
Th@@ ose things came along too re@@ cent@@ ly .
"I mean that we ev@@ olved to see s@@ ac@@ re@@ d@@ ness all around us and to jo@@ in with others into te@@ am@@ s and cir@@ cle around s@@ ac@@ red obje@@ cts , people and ideas ."
This is why poli@@ ti@@ cs is so tri@@ b@@ al .
"Po@@ li@@ ti@@ cs is par@@ tly prof@@ ane , it &apos;s par@@ tly about self-@@ inter@@ est , but poli@@ ti@@ cs is also about s@@ ac@@ re@@ d@@ ness ."
It &apos;s about jo@@ ining with others to pur@@ su@@ e mor@@ al ideas .
"It &apos;s about the e@@ ter@@ na@@ l stru@@ gg@@ le between good and evi@@ l , and we all believe we &apos;re on the good team ."
"And most import@@ an@@ tly , if the sta@@ ir@@ case is real , it expla@@ ins the per@@ si@@ st@@ ent under@@ cur@@ r@@ ent of dis@@ s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion in moder@@ n life ."
"Because human be@@ ings are , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , hi@@ vi@@ sh cre@@ at@@ ures like bees ."
We &apos;re bees . We bu@@ st@@ ed out of the hi@@ ve during the En@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment .
We bro@@ ke down the old institu@@ tions and brought li@@ ber@@ ty to the op@@ pres@@ sed .
We un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed Ear@@ th@@ -@@ chang@@ ing cre@@ ati@@ vity and gener@@ ated v@@ ast we@@ alth and comfor@@ t .
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ a@@ ys we f@@ ly around like individu@@ al bees ex@@ ul@@ ting in our fre@@ e@@ dom .
But sometimes we won@@ der : Is this all there is ?
What should I do with my life ?
What &apos;s mis@@ sing ?
"What &apos;s mis@@ sing is that we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x , but moder@@ n , se@@ cular society was built to s@@ ati@@ s@@ fy our low@@ er , prof@@ ane selves ."
It &apos;s really comfor@@ table down here on the low@@ er level .
"C@@ ome , have a se@@ at in my home en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment cen@@ ter ."
One great challen@@ ge of moder@@ n life is to find the sta@@ ir@@ case am@@ id all the clu@@ t@@ ter and then to do something good and no@@ ble once you clim@@ b to the top .
I see this de@@ si@@ re in my students at the Uni@@ versity of V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
They all want to find a cause or cal@@ ling that they can th@@ row themselves into .
They &apos;re all sear@@ ching for their sta@@ ir@@ case .
And that gi@@ ves me hope because people are not pu@@ re@@ ly sel@@ fish .
Mo@@ st people long to over@@ come pe@@ t@@ t@@ iness and become part of something lar@@ ger .
And this expla@@ ins the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary re@@ son@@ ance of this simple me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or con@@ ju@@ red up ne@@ ar@@ ly 4@@ 00 years ago .
&quot; &quot; No man is an is@@ land entire of itself .
"E@@ very man is a piece of the contin@@ ent , a part of the ma@@ in . &quot; &quot; J@@ H : Thank you ."
( Applause )
"I would like to talk today about what I think is one of the gre@@ at@@ est ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ res human be@@ ings have em@@ bar@@ ked upo@@ n , which is the qu@@ est to understand the universe and our place in it ."
"My own inter@@ est in this sub@@ je@@ ct , and my pas@@ sion for it , began rather ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally ."
"I had b@@ ou@@ ght a cop@@ y of this book , &quot; &quot; The Uni@@ verse and D@@ r. E@@ inste@@ in &quot; &quot; — a used pa@@ per@@ back from a secon@@ d@@ hand bo@@ ok@@ stor@@ e in Se@@ at@@ tle ."
"A few years after that , in B@@ ang@@ al@@ ore , I was fin@@ ding it hard to f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep one night , and I pi@@ cked up this book , thinking it would put me to sle@@ ep in 10 minutes ."
"And as it happened , I read it from mi@@ dni@@ ght to five in the morning in one sh@@ ot ."
And I was left with this inten@@ se feeling of a@@ we and ex@@ h@@ il@@ ar@@ ation at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do .
And that feeling ha@@ sn &apos;t left me yet .
"That feeling was the tri@@ g@@ ger for me to actually change my car@@ e@@ er — from being a so@@ f@@ tw@@ are engine@@ er to become a science wri@@ ter — so that I could par@@ take in the jo@@ y of science , and also the jo@@ y of communi@@ c@@ ating it to others ."
"And that feeling also led me to a pi@@ l@@ g@@ ri@@ m@@ age of sor@@ ts , to go liter@@ ally to the en@@ ds of the ear@@ th to see tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , de@@ te@@ ct@@ ors , instru@@ ments that people are building , or have built , in order to pro@@ be the co@@ smo@@ s in gre@@ ater and gre@@ ater de@@ ta@@ il ."
"So it took me from places like Chi@@ le — the At@@ ac@@ ama D@@ es@@ er@@ t in Chi@@ le — to S@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ a , to under@@ ground min@@ es in the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese Al@@ ps , in Nor@@ ther@@ n America , all the way to An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca and even to the S@@ outh Po@@ le ."
"And today I would like to share with you some images , some stories of these tri@@ ps ."
"I have been basically sp@@ ending the last few years do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ing the ef@@ for@@ ts of some extre@@ me@@ ly in@@ tre@@ pi@@ d men and women who are pu@@ tting , liter@@ ally at times , their lives at st@@ ake working in some very re@@ mot@@ e and very h@@ ost@@ ile places so that they may ga@@ ther the fa@@ inte@@ st sig@@ n@@ als from the co@@ smo@@ s in order for us to understand this universe ."
And I first beg@@ in with a p@@ ie char@@ t — and I pro@@ mi@@ se this is the only p@@ ie char@@ t in the whole pres@@ ent@@ ation — but it se@@ ts up the state of our know@@ le@@ dge of the co@@ smo@@ s .
All the the@@ or@@ ies in physi@@ cs that we have today pro@@ per@@ ly expla@@ in what is called nor@@ mal matter — the stuff that we &apos;re all made of — and that &apos;s four percent of the universe .
"A@@ stron@@ om@@ ers and co@@ smo@@ logi@@ sts and physi@@ ci@@ sts think that there is something called dar@@ k matter in the universe , which makes up 2@@ 3 percent of the universe , and something called dar@@ k energy , which per@@ me@@ ates the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of sp@@ ace@@ -@@ time , that makes up another 7@@ 3 percent ."
"So if you look at this p@@ ie char@@ t , 9@@ 6 percent of the universe , at this point in our expl@@ or@@ ation of it , is un@@ known or not well under@@ sto@@ od ."
"And most of the experim@@ ents , tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es that I went to see are in some way ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sing this question , these two t@@ wi@@ n m@@ yst@@ er@@ ies of dar@@ k matter and dar@@ k energy ."
I will take you first to an under@@ ground m@@ ine in Nor@@ ther@@ n M@@ in@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a where people are looking for something called dar@@ k matter .
And the idea here is that they are looking for a sig@@ n of a dar@@ k matter parti@@ cle hi@@ tting one of their de@@ te@@ ct@@ ors .
"And the reason why they have to go under@@ ground is that , if you did this experim@@ ent on the surface of the Earth , the same experim@@ ent would be s@@ wa@@ m@@ ped by sig@@ n@@ als that could be created by things like co@@ smi@@ c ra@@ ys , am@@ b@@ ien@@ t radi@@ o acti@@ vity , even our own bod@@ ies . You might not believe it , but even our own bod@@ ies are radi@@ o@@ ac@@ tive enough to di@@ st@@ ur@@ b this experim@@ ent ."
So they go de@@ ep inside min@@ es to find a kind of environ@@ ment@@ al sil@@ ence that will al@@ low them to hear the ping of a dar@@ k matter parti@@ cle hi@@ tting their de@@ te@@ ctor .
"And I went to see one of these experim@@ ents , and this is actually — you can bar@@ ely see it , and the reason for that is it &apos;s enti@@ re@@ ly dar@@ k in there — this is a ca@@ ver@@ n that was left behind by the min@@ ers who left this m@@ ine in 19@@ 60 ."
And physi@@ ci@@ sts came and started using it some@@ time in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s .
"And the min@@ ers in the early part of the last century worked , liter@@ ally , in c@@ and@@ le@@ light ."
"And today , you would see this inside the m@@ ine , half a mi@@ le under@@ ground ."
This is one of the largest under@@ ground lab@@ s in the world .
"And , am@@ ong other things , they &apos;re looking for dar@@ k matter ."
"There is another way to sear@@ ch for dar@@ k matter , which is indi@@ re@@ ct@@ ly ."
"If dar@@ k matter ex@@ ist@@ s in our universe , in our gal@@ ax@@ y , then these parti@@ cles should be s@@ mas@@ h@@ ing together and produ@@ cing other parti@@ cles that we know about — one of them being neu@@ tr@@ in@@ os ."
And neu@@ tr@@ in@@ os you can de@@ te@@ ct by the sig@@ nature they leave when they h@@ it water mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les .
"When a neu@@ tr@@ in@@ o hi@@ ts a water mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le it e@@ mi@@ ts a kind of blue light , a f@@ las@@ h of blue light , and by looking for this blue light , you can essen@@ ti@@ ally understand something about the neu@@ tr@@ in@@ o and then , indi@@ re@@ ct@@ ly , something about the dar@@ k matter that might have created this neu@@ tr@@ in@@ o ."
"But you need very , very large vol@@ um@@ es of water in order to do this ."
You need something like ten@@ s of me@@ gat@@ ons of water — almost a gi@@ gat@@ on of water — in order to have any ch@@ ance of cat@@ ching this neu@@ tr@@ in@@ o .
And where in the world would you find such water ?
Well the R@@ us@@ si@@ ans have a t@@ ank in their own back@@ y@@ ard .
This is L@@ ake B@@ a@@ i@@ k@@ al .
It is the largest l@@ ake in the world . It &apos;s 8@@ 00 km long .
"It &apos;s about 40 to 50 km wi@@ de in most places , and one to two kilome@@ ters de@@ ep ."
And what the R@@ us@@ si@@ ans are doing is they &apos;re building these de@@ te@@ ct@@ ors and im@@ mer@@ sing them about a kilome@@ ter b@@ ene@@ ath the surface of the l@@ ake so that they can wat@@ ch for these f@@ las@@ h@@ es of blue light .
And this is the scen@@ e that gre@@ e@@ ted me when I lan@@ ded there .
This is L@@ ake B@@ a@@ i@@ k@@ al in the pe@@ ak of the S@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ an win@@ ter .
The l@@ ake is enti@@ re@@ ly f@@ roz@@ en .
"And the line of black d@@ ots that you see in the back@@ ground , that &apos;s the ice cam@@ p where the physi@@ ci@@ sts are working ."
"The reason why they have to work in win@@ ter is because they don &apos;t have the money to work in sum@@ m@@ er and sp@@ ring , which , if they did that , they would need ships and sub@@ mer@@ si@@ b@@ les to do their work ."
So they wa@@ it until win@@ ter — the l@@ ake is completely f@@ roz@@ en over — and they use this me@@ ter@@ -@@ thi@@ ck ice as a pl@@ at@@ form on which to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh their ice cam@@ p and do their work .
So this is the R@@ us@@ si@@ ans working on the ice in the pe@@ ak of the S@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ an win@@ ter .
"They have to dri@@ ll ho@@ les in the ice , di@@ ve down into the water — c@@ old , c@@ old water — to get h@@ old of the instru@@ ment , bring it up , do any re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s and ma@@ inten@@ ance that they need to do , put it back and get out before the ice me@@ l@@ ts ."
Because that p@@ ha@@ se of so@@ li@@ d ice la@@ sts for two months and it &apos;s full of c@@ rac@@ ks .
"And you have to imagine , there &apos;s an entire se@@ a@@ -@@ like l@@ ake under@@ ne@@ ath , moving ."
"I still don &apos;t understand this one R@@ us@@ si@@ an man working in his b@@ are ch@@ est , but that tel@@ ls you how hard he was working ."
"And these people , a hand@@ ful of people , have been working for 20 years , looking for parti@@ cles that may or may not exi@@ st ."
And they have de@@ di@@ c@@ ated their lives to it .
"And just to give you an idea , they have spent 20 million over 20 years ."
It &apos;s very har@@ sh con@@ di@@ tions .
They work on a sho@@ est@@ ring bud@@ get .
The to@@ i@@ le@@ ts there are liter@@ ally ho@@ les in the ground co@@ vered with a wo@@ o@@ den sh@@ ack .
"And it &apos;s that basi@@ c , but they do this every year ."
"F@@ ro@@ m S@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ a to the At@@ ac@@ ama D@@ es@@ er@@ t in Chi@@ le , to see something called The V@@ ery L@@ ar@@ ge T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e . The V@@ ery L@@ ar@@ ge T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e@@ "
is one of these things that ast@@ ron@@ om@@ ers do — they name their tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es rather uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ati@@ vely .
"I can tell you for a fact , that the next one that they &apos;re plan@@ ning is called The E@@ x@@ tre@@ me@@ ly L@@ ar@@ ge T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but the one after that is going to be called The O@@ ver@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly L@@ ar@@ ge T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e ."
"But n@@ one@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary piece of engine@@ ering ."
These are four 8@@ .@@ 2 me@@ ter tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es .
"And these tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , am@@ ong other things , they &apos;re being used to study how the ex@@ pan@@ sion of the universe is chang@@ ing with time ."
"And the more you understand that , the better you would understand what this dar@@ k energy that the universe is made of is all about ."
And one piece of engine@@ ering that I want to leave you with as re@@ gar@@ ds this tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e is the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r .
"E@@ ach mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , there are four of them , is made of a single piece of gl@@ as@@ s , a mon@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic piece of high-@@ te@@ ch cer@@ ami@@ c , that has been ground down and poli@@ shed to such ac@@ cu@@ rac@@ y that the only way to understand what that is is &#91; to &#93; imagine a city like Par@@ is , with all its buil@@ dings and the E@@ i@@ f@@ fe@@ l T@@ ow@@ er , if you gr@@ ind down Par@@ is to that kind of ac@@ cu@@ rac@@ y , you would be left with bu@@ m@@ ps that are one mi@@ lli@@ me@@ ter high ."
And that &apos;s the kind of poli@@ sh@@ ing that these mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r@@ s have en@@ du@@ red .
A@@ n ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary set of tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es .
Here &apos;s another view of the same .
The reason why you have to build these tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es in places like the At@@ ac@@ ama D@@ es@@ er@@ t is because of the high al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de des@@ er@@ t .
"The d@@ ry air is really good for tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , and also , the cl@@ ou@@ d co@@ ver is be@@ low the sum@@ m@@ it of these m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins so that the tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es have about 3@@ 00 days of clear sk@@ ies ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , I want to take you to An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca ."
I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world .
This is co@@ smo@@ logy &apos;s fin@@ al fron@@ t@@ ier .
"S@@ ome of the most amazing experim@@ ents , some of the most extre@@ me experim@@ ents , are being done in An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca ."
"I was there to view something called a lon@@ g@@ -@@ du@@ r@@ ation bal@@ lo@@ on f@@ light , which basically takes tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es and instru@@ ments all the way to the u@@ pp@@ er atmo@@ sp@@ here , the u@@ pp@@ er str@@ at@@ o@@ sp@@ here , 40 km up ."
"And that &apos;s where they do their experim@@ ents , and then the bal@@ lo@@ on , the pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad , is brought down ."
So this is us lan@@ ding on the R@@ os@@ s I@@ ce S@@ hel@@ f in An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca .
That &apos;s an American C@@ -@@ 1@@ 7 car@@ go pl@@ ane that f@@ le@@ w us from New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and to M@@ c@@ M@@ ur@@ do in An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca .
And here we are about to bo@@ ard our bu@@ s .
"And I don &apos;t know if you can read the let@@ ter@@ ing , but it says , &quot; &quot; I@@ v@@ an the T@@ er@@ ri@@ bu@@ s . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s taking us to M@@ c@@ M@@ ur@@ do ."
And this is the scen@@ e that gre@@ ets you in M@@ c@@ M@@ ur@@ do .
And you bar@@ ely might be able to make out this hu@@ t here .
This hu@@ t was built by Rob@@ er@@ t F@@ al@@ c@@ on S@@ c@@ ot@@ t and his men when they first came to An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca on their first expe@@ di@@ tion to go to the S@@ outh Po@@ le .
"Because it &apos;s so c@@ old , the entire cont@@ ents of that hu@@ t is still as they left it , with the re@@ m@@ n@@ an@@ ts of the last me@@ al they co@@ o@@ ked still there ."
It &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary place .
"This is M@@ c@@ M@@ ur@@ do itself . A@@ b@@ out a thous@@ and people work here in sum@@ m@@ er , and about 2@@ 00 in win@@ ter when it &apos;s completely dar@@ k for six months ."
I was here to see the la@@ un@@ ch of this particular ty@@ pe of instru@@ ment .
This is a co@@ smi@@ c ra@@ y experim@@ ent that has been la@@ un@@ ched all the way to the up@@ per@@ -@@ str@@ at@@ o@@ sp@@ here to an al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de of 40 km .
What I want you to imagine is this is two t@@ ons in we@@ ight .
So you &apos;re using a bal@@ lo@@ on to car@@ ry something that is two t@@ ons all the way to an al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de of 40 km .
"And the engine@@ ers , the techni@@ ci@@ ans , the physi@@ ci@@ sts have all got to as@@ se@@ m@@ ble on the R@@ os@@ s I@@ ce S@@ hel@@ f , because An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca — I won &apos;t go into the reas@@ ons why — but it &apos;s one of the most fa@@ v@@ or@@ able places for doing these bal@@ lo@@ on la@@ un@@ ch@@ es , ex@@ cept for the we@@ a@@ ther ."
"The we@@ a@@ ther , as you can imagine , this is sum@@ m@@ er , and you &apos;re standing on 2@@ 00 ft of ice ."
"And there &apos;s a vol@@ c@@ ano behind , which has gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ s at the very top ."
"And what they have to do is they have to as@@ se@@ m@@ ble the entire bal@@ lo@@ on — the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , par@@ ach@@ u@@ te and everything — on the ice and then fi@@ ll it up with he@@ li@@ um ."
And that process takes about two hours .
And the we@@ a@@ ther can change as they &apos;re pu@@ tting together this whole as@@ se@@ m@@ bly .
"For in@@ stance , here they are la@@ ying down the bal@@ lo@@ on f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c behind , which is ev@@ en@@ tually going to be fil@@ led up with he@@ li@@ um ."
Th@@ ose two tru@@ cks you see at the very end car@@ ry 12 tan@@ ks each of com@@ pres@@ sed he@@ li@@ um .
"Now , in case the we@@ a@@ ther chang@@ es before the la@@ un@@ ch , they have to actually p@@ ack everything back up into their bo@@ x@@ es and take it out back to M@@ c@@ M@@ ur@@ do St@@ ation ."
"And this particular bal@@ lo@@ on , because it has to la@@ un@@ ch two t@@ ons of we@@ ight , is an extre@@ me@@ ly huge bal@@ lo@@ on ."
The f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c alone we@@ igh@@ s two t@@ ons .
"In order to min@@ imi@@ ze the we@@ ight , it &apos;s very th@@ in , it &apos;s as th@@ in as a s@@ and@@ wi@@ ch w@@ ra@@ pp@@ er ."
"And if they have to p@@ ack it back , they have to put it into bo@@ x@@ es and st@@ am@@ p on it so that it fi@@ ts into the box again — ex@@ cept , when they did it first , it would have been done in T@@ ex@@ as ."
"H@@ ere , they can &apos;t do it with the kind sho@@ es they &apos;re we@@ aring , so they have to take their sho@@ es off , get bar@@ e@@ fo@@ ot into the bo@@ x@@ es , in this c@@ old , and do that kind of work ."
That &apos;s the kind of de@@ di@@ cation these people have .
"H@@ ere &apos;s the bal@@ lo@@ on being fil@@ led up with he@@ li@@ um , and you can see it &apos;s a gor@@ ge@@ ous si@@ ght ."
Here &apos;s a scen@@ e that shows you the bal@@ lo@@ on and the pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad en@@ d-@@ to@@ -@@ end .
"So the bal@@ lo@@ on is being fil@@ led up with he@@ li@@ um on the le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side , and the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c actually ru@@ ns all the way to the mi@@ ddle where there &apos;s a piece of ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs and ex@@ plo@@ si@@ ves being conne@@ cted to a par@@ ach@@ u@@ te , and then the par@@ ach@@ u@@ te is then conne@@ cted to the pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad ."
"And remember , all this wi@@ ring is being done by people in extre@@ me c@@ old , in sub@@ -@@ zer@@ o temper@@ at@@ ures ."
"They &apos;re we@@ aring about 15 k@@ g of clo@@ thing and stuff , but they have to take their g@@ lo@@ ves off in order to do that ."
And I would like to share with you a la@@ un@@ ch .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) R@@ ad@@ i@@ o : O@@ kay , rele@@ ase the bal@@ lo@@ on , rele@@ ase the bal@@ lo@@ on , rele@@ ase the bal@@ lo@@ on ."
A@@ ni@@ l An@@ an@@ th@@ as@@ wamy : And I &apos;ll finally like to leave you with two images .
"This is an obser@@ v@@ at@@ ory in the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as , in L@@ ad@@ ak@@ h in Indi@@ a ."
And the thing I want you to look at here is the tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e on the ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side .
And on the far left there is a 4@@ 00 year@@ -@@ old Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ st mon@@ ast@@ ery .
This is a clo@@ se@@ -@@ up of the Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ st mon@@ ast@@ ery .
And I was stru@@ ck by the ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posi@@ tion of these two en@@ or@@ m@@ ous dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ines that hum@@ ani@@ ty has .
"One is expl@@ or@@ ing the co@@ smo@@ s on the outside , and the other one is expl@@ or@@ ing our inter@@ i@@ or being ."
And both requi@@ re sil@@ ence of some sort .
"And what stru@@ ck me was every place that I went to to see these tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , the ast@@ ron@@ om@@ ers and co@@ smo@@ logi@@ sts are in sear@@ ch of a certain kind of sil@@ ence , whether it &apos;s sil@@ ence from radi@@ o pol@@ lu@@ tion or light pol@@ lu@@ tion or whatever ."
"And it was very obvi@@ ous that , if we de@@ stro@@ y these sil@@ ent places on Earth , we will be stu@@ ck on a planet without the ability to look ou@@ twar@@ ds , because we will not be able to understand the sig@@ n@@ als that come from ou@@ ter space ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
D@@ o@@ es any@@ body know when the ste@@ th@@ os@@ cop@@ e was inv@@ en@@ ted ?
A@@ ny gu@@ ess@@ es ? 1@@ 8@@ 16 .
"And what I can say is , in 20@@ 16 , do@@ ct@@ ors ar@@ en &apos;t going to be wal@@ king around with ste@@ th@@ os@@ cop@@ es ."
"There &apos;s a whole lot better technology coming , and that &apos;s part of the change in medi@@ cine ."
What has changed our society has been wi@@ rel@@ ess de@@ vi@@ ces .
"But the future are di@@ gi@@ tal medi@@ cal wi@@ rel@@ ess de@@ vi@@ ces , OK ?"
"So , let me give you some exam@@ ples of this to kind of make this much more con@@ cre@@ te ."
This is the first one . This is an ele@@ c@@ tro@@ car@@ di@@ ogra@@ m .
"And , as a car@@ di@@ ologi@@ st , to think that you could see in real time a patien@@ t , an individu@@ al , any@@ where in the world on your s@@ mart@@ phone , wat@@ ching your r@@ hy@@ th@@ m — that &apos;s incredible , and it &apos;s with us today ."
But that &apos;s just the beginning .
You che@@ ck your e@@ ma@@ il while you &apos;re sitting here .
"In the future you &apos;re going to be che@@ c@@ king all your vi@@ tal sig@@ ns , all your vi@@ tal sig@@ ns : your heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , your blo@@ od pres@@ sure , your o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en , your temper@@ ature , et@@ c ."
This is already available today .
This is A@@ ir@@ St@@ ri@@ p T@@ ech@@ no@@ log@@ ies .
"It &apos;s now wi@@ red — or I should say , wi@@ rel@@ ess — by taking the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate of these sig@@ n@@ als in the ho@@ spit@@ al , in the inten@@ sive care uni@@ t , and pu@@ tting it on a s@@ mart@@ phone for physi@@ ci@@ ans ."
"If you &apos;re an expe@@ ct@@ ant par@@ ent , what about the ability to mon@@ it@@ or , contin@@ u@@ ously , fe@@ tal heart r@@ ate , or in@@ tra@@ u@@ ter@@ ine con@@ trac@@ tions , and not having to wor@@ ry so much that things are f@@ ine as the pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy , and moving over into the time of deli@@ very ?"
"And then as we go f@@ ur@@ ther , today we have contin@@ u@@ ous g@@ lu@@ co@@ se sen@@ sor@@ s ."
"R@@ ight now , they are under the sk@@ in , but in the future , they won &apos;t have to be im@@ plan@@ ted ."
"And of course , the de@@ si@@ red r@@ ange — trying to keep g@@ lu@@ co@@ se between 7@@ 5 and less than 2@@ 00 , che@@ c@@ king it every five minutes in a contin@@ u@@ ous g@@ lu@@ co@@ se sen@@ s@@ or — you &apos;ll see how that can impac@@ t di@@ a@@ be@@ tes ."
And what about sle@@ ep ?
We &apos;re going to z@@ o@@ om in on that a little bit .
We &apos;re sup@@ posed to spend a third of our life in sle@@ ep .
"What if , on your phone , which will be available in the next few weeks , you had every minu@@ te of your sle@@ ep disp@@ la@@ yed ?"
"And this is , of course , as you can see , the a@@ wa@@ ke is the or@@ ange ."
"The R@@ E@@ M sle@@ ep , ra@@ pi@@ d ey@@ e movement , dre@@ am state , is in light green ; and light is gra@@ y , light sle@@ ep ; and de@@ ep sle@@ ep , the best re@@ stor@@ ative sle@@ ep , is that dar@@ k green ."
How about coun@@ ting every cal@@ or@@ ie ?
"And this is ability , in real time , to actually take meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments of cal@@ or@@ ic in@@ take as well as ex@@ pen@@ di@@ ture , through a B@@ and@@ -@@ A@@ id ."
"Now , what I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about are physi@@ ologi@@ c me@@ tri@@ cs ."
"But what I want to get to , the next fron@@ t@@ ier , very quickly , and why the ste@@ th@@ os@@ cop@@ e is on its way out , is because we can tran@@ sc@@ end list@@ ening to the val@@ ve sounds , and the bre@@ ath sounds , because now , in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced by G@@ .@@ E@@ . is a hand@@ he@@ ld ul@@ tra@@ -@@ sound ."
Why is this important ? Because this is so much more sen@@ si@@ tive .
"H@@ ere is an example of an ab@@ dom@@ in@@ al ul@@ tra@@ sound , and also a car@@ di@@ a@@ c ech@@ o , which can be s@@ ent wi@@ rel@@ ess , and then there &apos;s an example of fe@@ tal mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing on your s@@ mart@@ phone ."
"So , we &apos;re not just talking about physi@@ ologi@@ c me@@ tri@@ cs — the key meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments of vi@@ tal sig@@ ns , and all those things in physi@@ o@@ logy — but also all the imag@@ ing that one could look at in your s@@ mart@@ phone ."
"Now , this is an example of another ob@@ so@@ le@@ te technology , so@@ on to be bur@@ ied : the H@@ ol@@ ter M@@ on@@ it@@ or ."
"T@@ wen@@ ty@@ -@@ four hour recor@@ ding , lots of wi@@ res ."
This is now a little t@@ iny pat@@ ch .
You can put it on for two weeks and sen@@ d it in the ma@@ il .
"Now , how does this work ? Well , there is these s@@ mar@@ t B@@ and@@ -@@ A@@ i@@ ds or these sen@@ sor@@ s that one would put on , on a sho@@ e or on the wri@@ st ."
And this sen@@ ds a sig@@ na@@ l and it cre@@ ates a body area network to a g@@ ate@@ way .
"G@@ ate@@ way could be a s@@ mart@@ phone or it could be a de@@ di@@ c@@ ated g@@ ate@@ way , as today many of these things are de@@ di@@ c@@ ated g@@ ate@@ ways , because they are not so well inte@@ gr@@ ated ."
"That sig@@ na@@ l goes to the we@@ b , the cl@@ ou@@ d , and then it can be pro@@ cess@@ ed and s@@ ent any@@ where : to a car@@ e@@ gi@@ ver , to a physi@@ ci@@ an , back to the patien@@ t , et@@ c ."
"So , that &apos;s basically very sim@@ pli@@ stic technology of how this works ."
"Now , I have this de@@ vice on ."
"I didn &apos;t want to take my sh@@ ir@@ t off to show you , but I can tell you it &apos;s on ."
"This is a de@@ vice that not only meas@@ ures car@@ di@@ a@@ c r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , as you saw already , but it also goes well be@@ y@@ ond that ."
This is me now . And you can see the E@@ C@@ G .
Be@@ low that &apos;s the ac@@ tu@@ al heart r@@ ate and the tr@@ end ; to the right of that is a bio@@ con@@ du@@ ct@@ ant .
"That &apos;s the flu@@ id stat@@ us , flu@@ id stat@@ us , that &apos;s really important if you &apos;re mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing somebody with heart fai@@ lu@@ re ."
"And be@@ low that &apos;s temper@@ ature , and re@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation , and o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en , and then the posi@@ tion acti@@ vity ."
"So , this is really stri@@ king , because this de@@ vice meas@@ ures seven things that are very much vi@@ tal sig@@ ns for mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing someone with heart fai@@ lu@@ re . OK ?"
"And why is this important ? Well , this is the most ex@@ pen@@ sive bed ."
What if we could redu@@ ce the need for ho@@ spit@@ al be@@ ds ?
"Well , we can . F@@ ir@@ st of all , heart fai@@ lu@@ re is the number one reason for ho@@ spit@@ al ad@@ mis@@ sions and re@@ ad@@ mis@@ sions in this country ."
"The cost of heart fai@@ lu@@ re is 3@@ 7 billion dollars a year , which is 80 percent re@@ lated to ho@@ spit@@ aliz@@ ation ."
"And in the course of 30 days after a ho@@ spit@@ al st@@ ay for a Me@@ di@@ care gre@@ ater than 6@@ 5 years or ol@@ der , is — 2@@ 7 percent are re@@ ad@@ mi@@ t@@ ted in 30 days , and by six months , over 5@@ 6 percent are re@@ ad@@ mi@@ t@@ ted ."
"So , can we impro@@ ve that ? Well the idea is we take this de@@ vice that I &apos;m we@@ aring , and we put it on 6@@ 00 patients with heart fai@@ lu@@ re , ran@@ dom@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned , ver@@ su@@ s 6@@ 00 patients who don &apos;t have ac@@ tive mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing , and see whether we can redu@@ ce heart fai@@ lu@@ re re@@ ad@@ mis@@ sions , and that &apos;s exci@@ ting . And we &apos;ll start that tri@@ al , and you &apos;ll hear more about how we &apos;re going to do that , but that &apos;s a ty@@ pe of wi@@ rel@@ ess de@@ vice tri@@ al that could change medi@@ cine in the years a@@ head ."
"Wh@@ y now ? Why has this all of a sud@@ den become a re@@ ality , an exci@@ ting dire@@ ction in the future of medi@@ cine ?"
"What we have is , in a way , a perfe@@ ct posi@@ tive stor@@ m ."
This se@@ ts up con@@ sum@@ er@@ -@@ dri@@ ven health@@ care .
That &apos;s where this is all star@@ ting .
"L@@ et me just give you speci@@ fi@@ cs about why this is a big movement if you &apos;re not aw@@ are of it : 1@@ .@@ 2 million Ameri@@ cans have got@@ ten a Ni@@ ke sho@@ e , which is a bod@@ y@@ -@@ area network that conne@@ cts the sho@@ e , the so@@ le of the sho@@ e to the i@@ P@@ h@@ one , or an i@@ P@@ od ."
And this Wi@@ red M@@ ag@@ az@@ ine co@@ ver arti@@ cle really cap@@ tu@@ red a lot of this ; it tal@@ ked a lot about the Ni@@ ke sho@@ e and how quickly that &apos;s been ad@@ op@@ ted to mon@@ it@@ or ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se physi@@ o@@ logy and energy ex@@ pen@@ di@@ ture .
"H@@ ere are some things , the prin@@ ci@@ ples that are gu@@ i@@ ding prin@@ ci@@ ples to keep in mind : &quot; &quot; A d@@ at@@ a@@ -@@ dri@@ ven health re@@ v@@ olution pro@@ mis@@ es to make us all better , f@@ ast@@ er , and stron@@ ger . Li@@ ving by num@@ bers . &quot; &quot; And this one , which is really tel@@ ling , this was from Ju@@ ly , this co@@ ver arti@@ cle : &quot; &quot; The per@@ s@@ onal me@@ tri@@ cs movement goes way be@@ y@@ ond d@@ ie@@ t and ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se . It &apos;s about trac@@ king every fac@@ et of life , from sle@@ ep to mo@@ od to pa@@ in , 2@@ 4 / 7 / 3@@ 6@@ 5 . &quot; &quot; Well , I tr@@ ied this de@@ vice ."
A lot of you have got@@ ten that P@@ h@@ il@@ li@@ ps D@@ i@@ re@@ ct Li@@ fe .
"I didn &apos;t have one of those , but I got the F@@ it@@ bit ."
That looks like this .
"It &apos;s like a wi@@ rel@@ ess ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ome@@ ter , pe@@ dom@@ e@@ ter ."
"And I want to just give you the resul@@ ts of that test@@ ing , because I wanted to understand about the con@@ sum@@ er movement ."
"I hope the , by the way , the P@@ h@@ il@@ li@@ ps D@@ i@@ re@@ ct Li@@ fe works better — I hope so ."
"But this mon@@ it@@ ors food , it mon@@ it@@ ors acti@@ vity and trac@@ ks we@@ ight ."
H@@ ow@@ ever you have to put in most of this stuff .
"The only thing it really trac@@ ks by itself is acti@@ vity , and even then , it &apos;s not comple@@ te ."
"So , you ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se and it pi@@ cks up the ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se ."
"You put in your he@@ ight and we@@ ight , it cal@@ cu@@ lat@@ es B@@ M@@ I , and of course it tel@@ ls you how many cal@@ or@@ ies you &apos;re ex@@ pen@@ ding from the ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se , and how many you took in , if you go in and enter all the fo@@ ods ."
But it really wan@@ ts you to enter all your acti@@ vity .
"And so I went to this , and of course I was gr@@ ati@@ f@@ ied that it pi@@ cked up the 4@@ 2 minutes of ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se , el@@ li@@ p@@ tical ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se I did , but then it wan@@ ts more information ."
"So , it says , &quot; &quot; You want to lo@@ g se@@ x@@ u@@ al acti@@ vity ."
"H@@ ow long did you do it for ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it says , &quot; &quot; How hard was it ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more it says , &quot; &quot; St@@ art time . &quot; &quot; Now , this doesn &apos;t ap@@ pe@@ ar — this just doesn &apos;t work , I mean , this just doesn &apos;t work ."
"So , now I want to move to sle@@ ep ."
"Wh@@ o would ever have thought you could have your own E@@ E@@ G at your home , t@@ ag@@ g@@ ed to a very nice al@@ ar@@ m clo@@ ck , by the way ?"
This is the he@@ ad@@ b@@ and that goes with this al@@ ar@@ m clo@@ ck .
"It mon@@ it@@ ors your bra@@ in@@ wa@@ ves contin@@ u@@ ously , when you &apos;re sle@@ e@@ ping ."
"So , I did this thing for seven days getting ready for TE@@ D@@ M@@ ed ."
"This is an important part of our life , one@@ -@@ third you &apos;re sup@@ posed to be sle@@ e@@ ping ."
O@@ f course how many here have any problems with sle@@ e@@ ping ?
"It &apos;s usu@@ ally 90 percent . So , you tell me you sle@@ ep better than expe@@ cted ."
"O@@ kay , well this was a week of my life in sle@@ e@@ ping , and you get a Z@@ .@@ Q@@ . sc@@ ore . In@@ ste@@ ad of an I@@ .@@ Q@@ . sc@@ ore , you get a Z@@ .@@ Q@@ . sc@@ ore when you wa@@ ke up ."
"You say , &quot; &quot; Oh , OK . &quot; &quot; And a Z@@ .@@ Q@@ . sc@@ ore is ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ed to age , and you want to get as high as you possi@@ bly can ."
"So this is the mom@@ ent@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ moment , or minu@@ te@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ minu@@ te sle@@ ep ."
And you see that Z@@ .@@ Q@@ . there was 8@@ 0-@@ od@@ d .
And the wa@@ ke time is in or@@ ange .
"And this can be a problem , as I learned ."
"Because it not only hel@@ ps you with qu@@ anti@@ f@@ ying your sle@@ ep , but also tel@@ ls others you &apos;re a@@ wa@@ ke ."
"So , when my wi@@ fe came in and she could tell you &apos;re a@@ wa@@ ke ."
"&quot; E@@ ri@@ c , I want to talk . I want to talk . &quot;"
And I &apos;m trying to play pos@@ su@@ m .
"This thing is very , very im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"O@@ K . So , that &apos;s the first night ."
"And this one is now 6@@ 7 , and that &apos;s not a good sc@@ ore ."
"And this tel@@ ls you , of course , how much you had in R@@ E@@ M sle@@ ep , in de@@ ep sle@@ ep , and all this sort of thing ."
This was really fas@@ cin@@ ating because this gave that qu@@ anti@@ tation about all the different p@@ ha@@ ses of sle@@ ep .
"So , it also then tel@@ ls you how you do com@@ par@@ ed to your age group ."
It &apos;s like a man@@ aged compe@@ ti@@ tion of sle@@ ep .
And really interesting stuff .
"L@@ ook at this thing and say , &quot; &quot; Well , I didn &apos;t think I was a very good sle@@ e@@ per , but actually I did better than a@@ ver@@ age in 50 to 60 year ol@@ ds . &quot; &quot; OK ?"
"And the key thing was , what I didn &apos;t know , was that I was a really good dre@@ am@@ er ."
OK . Now let &apos;s move from sle@@ ep to dise@@ ases .
"E@@ igh@@ ty percent of Ameri@@ cans have chro@@ nic dise@@ ase , or 80 percent of age gre@@ ater than 6@@ 5 have two or more chro@@ nic dise@@ ase , 1@@ 40 million Ameri@@ cans have one or more chro@@ nic dise@@ ase , and 80 percent of our 1@@ .@@ 5 , whatever , tri@@ llion ex@@ pen@@ di@@ tu@@ res are re@@ lated to chro@@ nic dise@@ ase ."
"Now , di@@ a@@ be@@ tes is one of the big ones ."
Al@@ most 2@@ 4 million people have di@@ a@@ be@@ tes .
"And here is the lat@@ est ma@@ p . It was publi@@ shed just a little more than a week ago in the New York T@@ im@@ es , and it isn &apos;t looking good ."
"That is , for men , 2@@ 9 percent in the country over 60 have Ty@@ pe I@@ I di@@ a@@ be@@ tes , and women , al@@ though it &apos;s less , it &apos;s terri@@ bly high ."
"But of course we have a way to meas@@ ure that now on a contin@@ u@@ ous basi@@ s , with a sen@@ s@@ or that de@@ te@@ cts blo@@ od g@@ lu@@ co@@ se , and it &apos;s important because we could de@@ te@@ ct hy@@ per@@ gl@@ y@@ ce@@ mi@@ a that o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se wouldn &apos;t be known , and also hy@@ po@@ gl@@ y@@ ce@@ mi@@ a ."
"And you can see the red d@@ ots , in this particular patien@@ t &apos;s case , were fin@@ ger sti@@ cks , which would have mis@@ sed both en@@ ds ."
"But by contin@@ u@@ ous mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing , it cap@@ tu@@ res all that vi@@ tal information ."
"The future of this though , is being able to move this to a B@@ and@@ -@@ A@@ id ty@@ pe ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on , and that &apos;s not so far away ."
"So , let me just give you , very quickly , 10 top tar@@ gets for wi@@ rel@@ ess medi@@ cine ."
"A@@ ll these things are possible — some of them are very close , or already , as you heard , are available today , in some way or form ."
"A@@ l@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s dise@@ ase : there &apos;s five million people af@@ fe@@ cted , and you can che@@ ck vi@@ tal sig@@ ns , acti@@ vity , bal@@ ance ."
"A@@ s@@ th@@ ma : large number , we could de@@ te@@ ct things like pol@@ le@@ n coun@@ t , air qu@@ ality , re@@ sp@@ ir@@ at@@ ory r@@ ate . B@@ re@@ ast can@@ cer , I &apos;ll show you an example of that real quickly ."
Ch@@ ro@@ nic ob@@ stru@@ ctive pul@@ mon@@ ary dise@@ ase .
"D@@ e@@ pres@@ sion , there &apos;s a great appro@@ ach to that in mo@@ od di@@ sor@@ ders ."
D@@ i@@ a@@ be@@ tes I &apos;ve just men@@ tion@@ ed . H@@ ear@@ t fai@@ lu@@ re we already tal@@ ked about . H@@ y@@ per@@ ten@@ sion : 7@@ 4 million people could have contin@@ u@@ ous blo@@ od@@ -@@ pres@@ sure mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing to come up with much better man@@ ag@@ ement and pre@@ ven@@ tion .
"And obe@@ sity we already tal@@ ked about , the ways to get to that ."
And sle@@ ep di@@ sor@@ ders .
This is effe@@ ctive around the world . The ac@@ cess to s@@ mart@@ ph@@ ones and cell ph@@ ones today is ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary .
"And this arti@@ cle from The E@@ con@@ omi@@ st sum@@ med it up beauti@@ fully about the opportuni@@ ties in health across the develo@@ ping world : &quot; &quot; M@@ ob@@ ile ph@@ ones made a bi@@ g@@ ger difference to the lives of more people , more quickly , than any pre@@ vi@@ ous technology . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s before we got going on the m@@ -@@ health world ."
"A@@ g@@ ing : The problem is en@@ or@@ m@@ ous , 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 bro@@ k@@ en hi@@ ps per year ; but the solu@@ tions are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary , and they inclu@@ de so many different things ."
One of the ones I just wanted to men@@ tion : The i@@ S@@ ho@@ e is another example of a sen@@ s@@ or that impro@@ ves pro@@ pri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion am@@ ong the el@@ der@@ ly to pre@@ v@@ ent fal@@ ling .
One of many different techni@@ qu@@ es using wi@@ rel@@ ess sen@@ sor@@ s .
"So , we can change medi@@ cine across the contin@@ u@@ um of care , across the ages from pre@@ mie@@ s or un@@ born children to s@@ eni@@ ors ; the ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ tical ar@@ en@@ a chang@@ es ; the full spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of dise@@ ase — I hope I &apos;ve given you a sense of that — across the g@@ lo@@ be ."
There are two things that can really ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate this whole process .
One of them — we &apos;re very for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate — is to develo@@ p a de@@ di@@ c@@ ated institu@@ te and that &apos;s work that started with the work that S@@ cri@@ pp@@ s with Q@@ u@@ al@@ com@@ m ...
"@@ and then the great for@@ tu@@ ne of me@@ e@@ ting up with G@@ ary and M@@ ary W@@ est , to get behind this wi@@ rel@@ ess health institu@@ te ."
S@@ an D@@ iego is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary place for this .
"There &apos;s over 6@@ 50 wi@@ rel@@ ess comp@@ an@@ ies , 100 of which or more are working in wi@@ rel@@ ess health ."
"It &apos;s the number one source of comm@@ er@@ ce , and interest@@ ing@@ ly it do@@ ve@@ ta@@ il@@ s beauti@@ fully with over 500 life science comp@@ an@@ ies ."
"The wi@@ rel@@ ess institu@@ te , the W@@ est Wi@@ rel@@ ess H@@ e@@ alth In@@ stitu@@ te , is really the out@@ grow@@ th of two ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary people who are here this ev@@ ening : G@@ ary and M@@ ary W@@ est . And I &apos;d like to give it up for them for getting behind this ."
"( Applause ) Th@@ e@@ ir fanta@@ stic ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pi@@ c inv@@ est@@ ment made this possible , and this is really a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it education cen@@ ter which is just about to open . It looks like this , this whole building de@@ di@@ c@@ ated ."
"And what it &apos;s trying to do is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate this era : to take un@@ met medi@@ cal needs , to work and in@@ no@@ v@@ ate — and we just ap@@ poin@@ ted the ch@@ ie@@ f engine@@ er , Me@@ h@@ ran Me@@ h@@ re@@ g@@ any , it was an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced on M@@ on@@ day — then to move up with develo@@ pment , c@@ lini@@ cal tri@@ al v@@ ali@@ d@@ ation and then chang@@ ing medi@@ cal prac@@ ti@@ ce , the most challen@@ g@@ ing thing of all , re@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing at@@ ten@@ tion to re@@ im@@ bur@@ se@@ ment , health@@ care poli@@ cy , health@@ care econ@@ omi@@ cs ."
"The other big thing , be@@ si@@ des having this fanta@@ stic institu@@ te to cat@@ al@@ y@@ ze this process is gu@@ i@@ dance , and that &apos;s of course rel@@ ying on the fact that medi@@ cine goes di@@ gi@@ tal ."
"If we understand bio@@ logy from gen@@ omi@@ cs and omi@@ cs and wi@@ rel@@ ess through physi@@ ologi@@ c ph@@ en@@ oty@@ ping , that &apos;s big ."
Because what it does is al@@ low a con@@ ver@@ g@@ ence like we &apos;ve never had before .
"O@@ ver 80 major dise@@ ases have been c@@ rac@@ ked at the gen@@ om@@ ic level , but this is quite ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary : M@@ ore has been learned about the under@@ p@@ in@@ n@@ ings of dise@@ ase in the last two and a half years than in the history of man ."
"And when you put that together with , for example , now an ap@@ p for the i@@ P@@ h@@ one with your gen@@ oty@@ pe to gu@@ i@@ de dru@@ g ther@@ ap@@ y ..."
"@@ but , the future — we can now tell who &apos;s going to get Ty@@ pe I@@ I di@@ a@@ be@@ tes from all the common v@@ ari@@ an@@ ts , and that &apos;s going to get fil@@ led in more with low@@ -@@ fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy v@@ ari@@ an@@ ts in the future ."
We can tell who &apos;s going to get bre@@ ast can@@ cer from the v@@ ari@@ ous gen@@ es .
We can also know who &apos;s li@@ ke@@ ly to get at@@ ri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation .
"And finally , another example : sud@@ den car@@ di@@ a@@ c death ."
E@@ ach of these has a sen@@ s@@ or .
We can give g@@ lu@@ co@@ se a sen@@ s@@ or for di@@ a@@ be@@ tes to pre@@ v@@ ent it .
"We can pre@@ v@@ ent , or have the ear@@ lie@@ st de@@ te@@ ction possible , for bre@@ ast can@@ cer with an ul@@ tra@@ sound de@@ vice given to the patien@@ t ."
"A@@ n i@@ P@@ at@@ ch , i@@ R@@ hy@@ th@@ m , for at@@ ri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation ."
And vi@@ tal@@ -@@ sig@@ ns mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing to pre@@ v@@ ent sud@@ den car@@ di@@ a@@ c death .
"We lo@@ se 7@@ 0@@ 0,000 people a year in the U.@@ S. from sud@@ den car@@ di@@ a@@ c death ."
"So , I hope I &apos;ve con@@ v@@ in@@ ced you of this , of the impac@@ t on ho@@ spit@@ al c@@ lin@@ ic re@@ sources is pro@@ found and then the impac@@ t on dise@@ ases is equ@@ ally im@@ pres@@ sive across all these different dise@@ ases and more ."
"It &apos;s really taking individu@@ aliz@@ ed medi@@ cine to a new he@@ ight and it &apos;s hy@@ per@@ -@@ in@@ no@@ v@@ ative , and I think it re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts the black s@@ wa@@ n of medi@@ cine ."
Th@@ an@@ ks for your at@@ ten@@ tion .
( Applause )
So that &apos;s the kind of thing that we do when we &apos;re pre@@ di@@ cting stuff about you on social media .
"We &apos;re looking for little pat@@ ter@@ ns of behavi@@ or that , when you de@@ te@@ ct them am@@ ong mi@@ llions of people , le@@ ts us find out all kinds of things ."
So this is something we &apos;ve stud@@ ied for a long time .
"Well , the le@@ ading epi@@ demi@@ ologi@@ sts and cri@@ min@@ ologi@@ sts around the world se@@ em to think we can , and so do I , but only if we fo@@ cus on our cities , es@@ pe@@ cially the most fra@@ gi@@ le ones ."
That &apos;s 2@@ 3 times the global a@@ ver@@ age .
There &apos;s 7@@ .@@ 3 billion people in the world today ; there will be 9@@ .@@ 6 billion by 20@@ 50 .
And this ex@@ pan@@ sion in urb@@ ani@@ z@@ ation is going to be ne@@ i@@ ther even no@@ r equ@@ it@@ able .
The im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations are dis@@ con@@ cer@@ ting .
"R@@ ight here in B@@ raz@@ il , the life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy is 7@@ 3@@ .@@ 6 years ."
"If you live in Ri@@ o , I &apos;m sor@@ ry , s@@ have off two right there ."
"But if you &apos;re young , you &apos;re u@@ ne@@ du@@ c@@ ated , you l@@ ack em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment , you &apos;re black , and you &apos;re m@@ ale , your life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy dro@@ ps to less than 60 years old ."
"But as we &apos;ve heard so many times , these new technolog@@ ies are du@@ al@@ -@@ ed@@ g@@ ed , right ?"
T@@ ake the case of la@@ w en@@ for@@ c@@ ement .
I &apos;m going to talk today about the ple@@ as@@ ures of every@@ day life .
But I want to beg@@ in with a story of an un@@ usu@@ al and terri@@ ble man .
This is H@@ er@@ man@@ n Go@@ ering .
"G@@ o@@ ering was H@@ it@@ ler &apos;s second in comm@@ and in World W@@ ar I@@ I , his desig@@ nat@@ ed suc@@ cess@@ or ."
"And like H@@ it@@ ler , Go@@ ering fan@@ cie@@ d hi@@ m@@ self a colle@@ ctor of art ."
"He went through Europ@@ e , through World W@@ ar I@@ I , ste@@ al@@ ing , ex@@ tor@@ ting and oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally bu@@ ying v@@ ari@@ ous pain@@ t@@ ings for his colle@@ ction ."
And what he really wanted was something by V@@ er@@ me@@ er .
"H@@ it@@ ler had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any ."
"So he finally found an art de@@ al@@ er , a D@@ ut@@ ch art de@@ al@@ er na@@ med H@@ an v@@ an Me@@ e@@ ger@@ en , who s@@ old him a wonderful V@@ er@@ me@@ er for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars ."
And it was his fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te ar@@ t@@ work ever .
"W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I came to an end , and Go@@ ering was cap@@ tu@@ red , tr@@ ied at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely s@@ ent@@ en@@ ced to death ."
Th@@ en the Al@@ lie@@ d for@@ ces went through his colle@@ ctions and found the pain@@ t@@ ings and went after the people who s@@ old it to him .
And at some point the D@@ ut@@ ch poli@@ ce came into Am@@ ster@@ d@@ am and ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed V@@ an Me@@ e@@ ger@@ en .
"@@ V@@ an Me@@ e@@ ger@@ en was char@@ g@@ ed with the cri@@ me of tre@@ as@@ on , which is itself pu@@ ni@@ sha@@ ble by death ."
"S@@ i@@ x weeks into his pri@@ son s@@ ent@@ ence , v@@ an Me@@ e@@ ger@@ en con@@ f@@ ess@@ ed ."
But he didn &apos;t con@@ f@@ ess to tre@@ as@@ on .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I did not se@@ ll a great ma@@ ster@@ piece to that N@@ az@@ i ."
I pain@@ ted it myself ; I &apos;m a for@@ ger . &quot; &quot; Now no@@ body belie@@ ved him .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll pro@@ ve it ."
"B@@ ring me a can@@ v@@ as and some pa@@ int , and I will pa@@ int a V@@ er@@ me@@ er much better than I s@@ old that dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing N@@ az@@ i ."
"I also need al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and mor@@ ph@@ ine , because it &apos;s the only way I can work . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So they brought him in ."
He pain@@ ted a beautiful V@@ er@@ me@@ er .
And then the char@@ ges of tre@@ as@@ on were dro@@ pped .
"He had a l@@ ess@@ er char@@ ge of for@@ g@@ ery , got a year s@@ ent@@ ence and d@@ ied a her@@ o to the D@@ ut@@ ch people ."
"There &apos;s a lot more to be said about v@@ an Me@@ e@@ ger@@ en , but I want to turn now to Go@@ ering , who &apos;s pi@@ ctu@@ red here being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g ."
"Now Go@@ ering was , by all ac@@ coun@@ ts , a terri@@ ble man ."
"E@@ ven for a N@@ az@@ i , he was a terri@@ ble man ."
H@@ is American inter@@ ro@@ gat@@ ors descri@@ bed him as an ami@@ c@@ able psy@@ ch@@ op@@ ath .
But you could feel sym@@ pa@@ th@@ y for the re@@ action he had when he was told that his fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te pain@@ ting was actually a for@@ g@@ ery .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to his bi@@ ogra@@ ph@@ er , &quot; &quot; He looked as if for the first time he had disco@@ vered there was evi@@ l in the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he kil@@ led hi@@ m@@ self so@@ on af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds ."
He had disco@@ vered after all that the pain@@ ting he thought was this was actually that .
"It looked the same , but it had a different ori@@ g@@ in , it was a different ar@@ t@@ work ."
It wasn &apos;t just him who was in for a sho@@ ck .
"O@@ n@@ ce v@@ an Me@@ e@@ ger@@ en was on tri@@ al , he couldn &apos;t stop talking ."
And he bo@@ ast@@ ed about all the great ma@@ ster@@ pie@@ ces that he hi@@ m@@ self had pain@@ ted that were at@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted to other arti@@ sts .
"In particular , &quot; &quot; The Su@@ pp@@ er at E@@ m@@ m@@ au@@ s &quot; &quot; which was vie@@ w@@ ed as V@@ er@@ me@@ er &apos;s fin@@ est ma@@ ster@@ piece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a for@@ g@@ ery ."
"It was not that pain@@ ting , but that pain@@ ting ."
"And when that was disco@@ vered , it lost all its val@@ ue and was taken away from the mus@@ e@@ um ."
Why does this matter ?
I &apos;m a psycho@@ logi@@ sts — why do ori@@ gin@@ s matter so much ?
Why do we re@@ spo@@ nd so much to our know@@ le@@ dge of where something comes from ?
Well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
"M@@ any so@@ ci@@ ologi@@ sts like V@@ e@@ b@@ le@@ n and W@@ ol@@ fe would ar@@ gu@@ e that the reason why we take ori@@ gin@@ s so seri@@ ously is because we &apos;re s@@ no@@ b@@ s , because we &apos;re fo@@ c@@ used on stat@@ us ."
"A@@ mon@@ g other things , if you want to show off how ri@@ ch you are , how powerful you are , it &apos;s always better to own an ori@@ gin@@ al than a for@@ g@@ ery because there &apos;s always going to be fe@@ wer ori@@ gin@@ als than for@@ ger@@ ies ."
"I don &apos;t d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that that pla@@ ys some ro@@ le , but what I want to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you of today is that there &apos;s something else going on . I want to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce y@@ ou@@ "
"@@ that hum@@ ans are , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , natural born essen@@ ti@@ ali@@ sts ."
"What I mean by this is we don &apos;t just re@@ spo@@ nd to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them ."
"R@@ a@@ ther , our respon@@ se is con@@ di@@ tion@@ ed on our belie@@ f@@ s , about what they really are , what they came from , what they &apos;re made of , what their hi@@ d@@ den nature is ."
"I want to su@@ ggest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we re@@ act to things ."
"So I want to su@@ ggest that ple@@ as@@ ure is de@@ ep — and that this isn &apos;t true just for high@@ er level ple@@ as@@ ures like art , but even the most seem@@ ing@@ ly simple ple@@ as@@ ures are af@@ fe@@ cted by our belie@@ f@@ s about hi@@ d@@ den essen@@ ces ."
So take food .
W@@ ould you e@@ at this ?
"Well , a good answer is , &quot; &quot; It depen@@ ds . What is it ? &quot; &quot; S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s por@@ k , but not be@@ e@@ f ."
"S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s be@@ e@@ f , but not por@@ k ."
F@@ e@@ w of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s a r@@ at or a human .
S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it only if it &apos;s a str@@ ang@@ ely co@@ lo@@ red piece of to@@ f@@ u .
That &apos;s not so sur@@ pri@@ sing .
But what &apos;s more interesting is how it ta@@ st@@ es to you will de@@ p@@ end cri@@ ti@@ cally on what you think you &apos;re e@@ ating .
So one de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of this was done with young children .
"H@@ ow do you make children not just be more li@@ ke@@ ly to e@@ at car@@ ro@@ ts and d@@ r@@ in@@ k mi@@ l@@ k , but to get more ple@@ as@@ ure from e@@ ating car@@ ro@@ ts and d@@ r@@ in@@ king mi@@ l@@ k — to think they ta@@ ste better ?"
"It &apos;s simple , you tell them they &apos;re from M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s ."
"They believe M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s food is ta@@ st@@ ier , and it le@@ ads them to experience it as ta@@ st@@ ier ."
How do you get ad@@ ul@@ ts to really en@@ jo@@ y w@@ ine ?
It &apos;s very simple : po@@ ur it from an ex@@ pen@@ sive bot@@ tle .
"There are now do@@ z@@ ens , per@@ haps hundre@@ ds of stud@@ ies show@@ ing that if you believe you &apos;re d@@ r@@ in@@ king the ex@@ pen@@ sive stuff , it ta@@ st@@ es better to you ."
This was re@@ cent@@ ly done with a neuro@@ scienti@@ fic t@@ wi@@ st .
"They get people into a f@@ M@@ R@@ I sc@@ an@@ ner , and while they &apos;re l@@ ying there , through a tu@@ be , they get to si@@ p w@@ ine ."
In front of them on a scre@@ en is information about the w@@ ine .
"E@@ very@@ body , of course , d@@ r@@ in@@ ks exactly the same w@@ ine ."
"But if you believe you &apos;re d@@ r@@ in@@ king ex@@ pen@@ sive stuff , par@@ ts of the brain as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with ple@@ as@@ ure and re@@ ward light up like a Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as t@@ ree ."
"It &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more ple@@ as@@ u@@ ra@@ ble , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way ."
O@@ r take se@@ x .
These are sti@@ mu@@ li I &apos;ve used in some of my stud@@ ies .
"And if you simply show people these pi@@ ctures , they &apos;ll say these are fa@@ ir@@ ly at@@ trac@@ tive people ."
"But how at@@ trac@@ tive you find them , how se@@ x@@ u@@ ally or ro@@ man@@ ti@@ cally mo@@ ved you are by them , re@@ sts cri@@ ti@@ cally on who you think you &apos;re looking at ."
"You probably think the picture on the left is m@@ ale , the one on the right is fe@@ m@@ ale ."
"If that belie@@ f turns out to be mist@@ ak@@ en , it will make a difference ."
( Laughter ) It will make a difference if they turn out to be much youn@@ ger or much ol@@ der than you think they are .
"It will make a difference if you were to disco@@ ver that the person you &apos;re looking at with l@@ ust is actually a dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed ver@@ sion of your son or d@@ aughter , your mother or father ."
K@@ now@@ ing somebody &apos;s your k@@ in ty@@ pi@@ cally kil@@ ls the li@@ bi@@ do .
Ma@@ ybe one of the most hear@@ ten@@ ing fin@@ dings from the psycho@@ logy of ple@@ as@@ ure is there &apos;s more to looking good than your physi@@ cal ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance .
"If you like somebody , they look better to you ."
This is why spo@@ uses in happy mar@@ ri@@ ages ten@@ d to think that their h@@ us@@ b@@ and or wi@@ fe looks much better than any@@ one else thin@@ ks that they do .
( Laughter ) A parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly dra@@ m@@ atic example of this comes from a neuro@@ logi@@ cal di@@ sor@@ der known as C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s syn@@ dro@@ me .
So C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s syn@@ dro@@ me is a di@@ sor@@ der where you get a speci@@ fic de@@ lu@@ sion .
Su@@ f@@ fer@@ ers of C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s syn@@ dro@@ me believe that the people they love most in the world have been re@@ plac@@ ed by perfe@@ ct du@@ p@@ lic@@ ates .
"Now often , a resul@@ t of C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s syn@@ dro@@ me is tra@@ gi@@ c ."
"P@@ e@@ ople have mu@@ r@@ der@@ ed those that they lo@@ ved , belie@@ ving that they were mu@@ r@@ der@@ ing an im@@ post@@ er ."
But there &apos;s at least one case where C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s syn@@ dro@@ me had a happy ending .
This was recor@@ ded in 19@@ 3@@ 1 .
&quot; &quot; R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch descri@@ bed a woman with C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s syn@@ dro@@ me who com@@ pla@@ ined about her po@@ or@@ ly en@@ dow@@ ed and se@@ x@@ u@@ ally in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate lo@@ ver . &quot; &quot; But that was before she got C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s syn@@ dro@@ me .
"A@@ f@@ ter she got it , &quot; &quot; She was happy to re@@ port that she has disco@@ vered that he pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed a d@@ ou@@ ble who was ri@@ ch , vi@@ ri@@ le , hand@@ some and ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ r@@ atic . &quot; &quot; O@@ f course , it was the same man , but she was seeing him in different ways ."
"As a third example , consi@@ der con@@ sum@@ er produ@@ cts ."
So one reason why you might like something is its u@@ ti@@ lity .
You can put sho@@ es on your fe@@ et ; you can play g@@ ol@@ f with g@@ ol@@ f clu@@ b@@ s ; and ch@@ ew@@ ed up bu@@ b@@ ble gu@@ m doesn &apos;t do anything at all for you .
But each of these three obje@@ cts has val@@ ue ab@@ o@@ ve and be@@ y@@ ond what it can do for you based on its history .
The g@@ ol@@ f clu@@ b@@ s were ow@@ ned by Joh@@ n F@@ . Ken@@ ne@@ dy and s@@ old for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of a million dollars at au@@ ction .
The bu@@ b@@ ble gu@@ m was ch@@ ew@@ ed up by po@@ p st@@ ar Bri@@ t@@ ney S@@ pe@@ ars and s@@ old for se@@ ver@@ al hundre@@ ds of dollars .
"And in fact , there &apos;s a th@@ ri@@ ving market in the parti@@ ally e@@ at@@ en food of be@@ lo@@ ved people ."
( Laughter ) The sho@@ es are per@@ haps the most val@@ u@@ able of all .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to an un@@ con@@ fir@@ med re@@ port , a S@@ aud@@ i mi@@ lli@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ re of@@ fer@@ ed 10 million dollars for this pa@@ ir of sho@@ es ."
They were the ones th@@ row@@ n at G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h at an I@@ ra@@ q@@ i pre@@ ss con@@ fer@@ ence se@@ ver@@ al years ago .
( Applause ) Now this at@@ trac@@ tion to obje@@ cts doesn &apos;t just work for ce@@ le@@ bri@@ ty obje@@ cts .
"E@@ ach one of us , most people , have something in our life that &apos;s liter@@ ally ir@@ re@@ plac@@ e@@ able , in that it has val@@ ue because of its history — maybe your we@@ d@@ ding ring , maybe your child &apos;s b@@ aby sho@@ es — so that if it was lost , you couldn &apos;t get it back ."
"You could get something that looked like it or felt like it , but you couldn &apos;t get the same obje@@ ct back ."
"Wi@@ th my colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es G@@ e@@ or@@ ge N@@ ew@@ man and G@@ il D@@ ie@@ sen@@ dru@@ ck , we &apos;ve looked to see what sort of fac@@ t@@ ors , what sort of history , mat@@ ters for the obje@@ cts that people like ."
"So in one of our experim@@ ents , we asked people to name a fam@@ ous person who they ad@@ o@@ red , a living person they ad@@ o@@ red ."
So one answer was G@@ e@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey .
"Th@@ en we asked them , &quot; How much would you pay for G@@ e@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey &apos;s s@@ we@@ ater ? &quot;"
And the answer is a fa@@ ir amount — more than you would pay for a br@@ and new s@@ we@@ ater or a s@@ we@@ ater ow@@ ned by somebody who you didn &apos;t ad@@ ore .
Th@@ en we asked other grou@@ ps of sub@@ je@@ cts — we gave them different re@@ stri@@ ctions and different con@@ di@@ tions .
"So for in@@ stance , we told some people , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , you can bu@@ y the s@@ we@@ ater , but you can &apos;t tell any@@ body you own it , and you can &apos;t re@@ se@@ ll it . &quot; &quot; That dro@@ ps the val@@ ue of it , su@@ gg@@ est@@ ing that that &apos;s one reason why we like it ."
"But what really ca@@ uses an effe@@ ct is you tell people , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , you could re@@ se@@ ll it , you could bo@@ ast about it , but before it gets to you , it &apos;s th@@ o@@ rou@@ gh@@ ly wa@@ shed . &quot; &quot; That ca@@ uses a huge dro@@ p in the val@@ ue ."
"As my wi@@ fe put it , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve wa@@ shed away the C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey co@@ ot@@ ies . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s go back to art ."
I would love a C@@ ha@@ g@@ all . I love the work of C@@ ha@@ g@@ all .
"If people want to get me something at the end of the con@@ fer@@ ence , you could bu@@ y me a C@@ ha@@ g@@ all ."
"But I don &apos;t want a du@@ p@@ lic@@ ate , even if I can &apos;t tell the difference ."
"That &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , I &apos;m a s@@ no@@ b and want to bo@@ ast about having an ori@@ gin@@ al ."
"R@@ a@@ ther , it &apos;s because I want something that has a speci@@ fic history ."
"In the case of ar@@ t@@ work , the history is spe@@ cial in@@ de@@ ed ."
"The phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ her D@@ en@@ is D@@ ut@@ ton in his wonderful book &quot; &quot; The Ar@@ t In@@ st@@ in@@ ct &quot; &quot; makes the case that , &quot; &quot; The val@@ ue of an ar@@ t@@ work is ro@@ ot@@ ed in as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions about the human perform@@ ance under@@ l@@ ying its cre@@ ation . &quot; &quot; And that could expla@@ in the difference between an ori@@ gin@@ al and a for@@ g@@ ery ."
"They may look ali@@ ke , but they have a different history ."
"The ori@@ gin@@ al is ty@@ pi@@ cally the produ@@ ct of a cre@@ ative act , the for@@ g@@ ery isn &apos;t ."
I think this appro@@ ach can expla@@ in differ@@ ences in people &apos;s ta@@ ste in art .
This is a work by J@@ ac@@ k@@ son P@@ ol@@ lo@@ ck .
Wh@@ o here li@@ k@@ es the work of J@@ ac@@ k@@ son P@@ ol@@ lo@@ ck ?
"O@@ kay . Wh@@ o here , it does nothing for them ?"
They just don &apos;t like it .
"I &apos;m not going to make a c@@ la@@ im about who &apos;s right , but I will make an em@@ pi@@ ri@@ cal c@@ la@@ im about people &apos;s in@@ tu@@ i@@ tions , which is that , if you like the work of J@@ ac@@ k@@ son P@@ ol@@ lo@@ ck , you &apos;ll ten@@ d more so than the people who don &apos;t like it to believe that these works are difficult to create , that they requi@@ re a lot of time and energy and cre@@ ative energy ."
"I use J@@ ac@@ k@@ son P@@ ol@@ lo@@ ck on pur@@ pos@@ e as an example because there &apos;s a young American arti@@ st who pain@@ ts very much in the sty@@ le of J@@ ac@@ k@@ son P@@ ol@@ lo@@ ck , and her work was wor@@ th many ten@@ s of thousands of dollars — in large part because she &apos;s a very young arti@@ st ."
This is Mar@@ la O@@ l@@ m@@ ste@@ ad who did most of her work when she was three years old .
The interesting thing about Mar@@ la O@@ l@@ m@@ ste@@ ad is her family made the mist@@ ake of in@@ vi@@ ting the tele@@ vision program 60 M@@ in@@ u@@ tes I@@ I into their house to film her pain@@ ting .
And they then re@@ por@@ ted that her father was co@@ ach@@ ing her .
"When this came out on tele@@ vision , the val@@ ue of her art dro@@ pped to nothing ."
"It was the same art , physi@@ cally , but the history had changed ."
"I &apos;ve been fo@@ c@@ using now on the vi@@ su@@ al ar@@ ts , but I want to give two exam@@ ples from music ."
"This is Jo@@ sh@@ u@@ a B@@ ell , a very fam@@ ous viol@@ ini@@ st ."
And the W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton Po@@ st re@@ por@@ ter G@@ ene W@@ e@@ ing@@ ar@@ ten decided to en@@ li@@ st him for an aud@@ aci@@ ous experim@@ ent .
"The question is : How much would people like Jo@@ sh@@ u@@ a B@@ ell , the music of Jo@@ sh@@ u@@ a B@@ ell , if they didn &apos;t know they were list@@ ening to Jo@@ sh@@ u@@ a B@@ ell ?"
So he got Jo@@ sh@@ u@@ a B@@ ell to take his million dol@@ lar vi@@ o@@ li@@ n down to a W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ . sub@@ way st@@ ation and stand in the cor@@ ner and see how much money he would make .
And here &apos;s a br@@ ie@@ f cli@@ p of this .
"( V@@ i@@ o@@ li@@ n music ) Af@@ ter being there for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of an hour , he made 3@@ 2 dollars ."
N@@ ot bad . It &apos;s also not good .
"A@@ p@@ par@@ ently to really en@@ jo@@ y the music of Jo@@ sh@@ u@@ a B@@ ell , you have to know you &apos;re list@@ ening to Jo@@ sh@@ u@@ a B@@ ell ."
"He actually made 20 dollars more than that , but he didn &apos;t coun@@ t it ."
Because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the video — she comes up .
She had heard him at the Li@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gre@@ ss a few weeks before at this ex@@ tra@@ v@@ ag@@ ant bl@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ t@@ ie af@@ fa@@ ir .
So she &apos;s st@@ un@@ ned that he &apos;s standing in a sub@@ way st@@ ation .
So she &apos;s stru@@ ck with pi@@ ty .
She re@@ ach@@ es into her pur@@ se and h@@ ands him a 20 .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The second example from music is from Joh@@ n C@@ age &apos;s moder@@ ni@@ st com@@ posi@@ tion , &quot; 4 &apos; 3@@ 3 &quot; . &quot;"
"As many of you know , this is the com@@ posi@@ tion where the pi@@ ani@@ st si@@ ts at a b@@ en@@ ch , open@@ s up the pi@@ ano and si@@ ts and does nothing for four minutes and 3@@ 3 secon@@ ds — that per@@ i@@ od of sil@@ ence ."
And people have different vie@@ ws on this .
But what I want to point out is you can bu@@ y this from i@@ T@@ un@@ es .
"( Laughter ) F@@ or a dol@@ lar 9@@ 9 , you can list@@ en to that sil@@ ence , which is different than other form@@ s of sil@@ ence . ( Laughter )"
"Now I &apos;ve been talking so far about ple@@ as@@ ure , but what I want to su@@ ggest is that everything I &apos;ve said ap@@ pl@@ ies as well to pa@@ in ."
"And how you think about what you &apos;re exper@@ ien@@ cing , your belie@@ f@@ s about the essen@@ ce of it , af@@ fe@@ ct how it h@@ ur@@ ts ."
One lo@@ vely experim@@ ent was done by K@@ ur@@ t G@@ ra@@ y and D@@ an W@@ e@@ g@@ ner .
What they did was they ho@@ o@@ ked up H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard under@@ gra@@ du@@ ates to an electri@@ c sho@@ ck mach@@ ine .
And they gave them a ser@@ ies of pain@@ ful electri@@ c sh@@ oc@@ ks .
So it was a ser@@ ies of five pain@@ ful sh@@ oc@@ ks .
"H@@ al@@ f of them are told that they &apos;re being given the sh@@ oc@@ ks by somebody in another room , but the person in the other room doesn &apos;t know they &apos;re gi@@ ving them sh@@ oc@@ ks ."
"There &apos;s no mal@@ ev@@ ol@@ ence , they &apos;re just pres@@ sing a bu@@ t@@ ton ."
The first sho@@ ck is recor@@ ded as very pain@@ ful .
"The second sho@@ ck feel@@ s less pain@@ ful , because you get a bit used to it ."
"The third dro@@ ps , the f@@ our@@ th , the fi@@ f@@ th ."
The pa@@ in gets less .
"In the other con@@ di@@ tion , they &apos;re told that the person in the next room is sh@@ oc@@ king them on pur@@ pos@@ e — know@@ s they &apos;re sh@@ oc@@ king them ."
The first sho@@ ck h@@ ur@@ ts like he@@ ll .
"The second sho@@ ck h@@ ur@@ ts just as much , and the third and the f@@ our@@ th and the fi@@ f@@ th ."
It h@@ ur@@ ts more if you believe somebody is doing it to you on pur@@ pos@@ e .
"The most extre@@ me example of this is that in some c@@ ases , pa@@ in under the right cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces can trans@@ form into ple@@ as@@ ure ."
H@@ um@@ ans have this ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly interesting pro@@ per@@ ty that will often se@@ ek out low@@ -@@ level do@@ ses of pa@@ in in contro@@ l@@ led cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces and take ple@@ as@@ ure from it — as in the e@@ ating of ho@@ t chi@@ li pe@@ p@@ per@@ s and rol@@ ler co@@ ast@@ er ri@@ des .
"The point was ni@@ ce@@ ly sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed by the po@@ et Joh@@ n M@@ il@@ ton who wro@@ te , &quot; &quot; The mind is its own place , and in itself can make a he@@ a@@ ven of he@@ ll , a he@@ ll of he@@ a@@ ven . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ll end with that . Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;ll tell you a little bit more about this .
So one of the dis@@ adv@@ an@@ t@@ ages of these small rob@@ ots is its size .
This man is we@@ aring what we call a be@@ e be@@ ard . ( Laughter ) A be@@ ard full of bees .
"Now , this is what many of you might picture when you think about hon@@ ey@@ bees , maybe in@@ se@@ cts , or maybe anything that has more le@@ gs than two ."
"And let me start by tel@@ ling you , I got@@ ch@@ a ."
"I understand that . But , there are many things to know , and I want you to open your min@@ ds here , keep them open , and change your perspe@@ ctive about hon@@ ey@@ bees ."
N@@ oti@@ ce that this man is not getting st@@ ung .
"He probably has a qu@@ e@@ en be@@ e t@@ ied to his ch@@ in , and the other bees are at@@ trac@@ ted to it ."
"So this really de@@ mon@@ str@@ ates our relation@@ ship with hon@@ ey@@ bees , and that goes de@@ ep back for thousands of years ."
"We &apos;re very co@@ -@@ ev@@ olved , because we de@@ p@@ end on bees for pol@@ lin@@ ation and , even more re@@ cent@@ ly , as an economic com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty ."
"M@@ any of you may have heard that hon@@ ey@@ bees are disa@@ p@@ pe@@ aring , not just dy@@ ing , but they &apos;re gone ."
We don &apos;t even find de@@ ad bod@@ ies .
"This is called col@@ ony col@@ lap@@ se di@@ sor@@ der , and it &apos;s bi@@ zar@@ re . R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers around the g@@ lo@@ be still do not know what &apos;s ca@@ using it , but what we do know is that , with the dec@@ lin@@ ing num@@ bers of bees , the co@@ sts of over 1@@ 30 f@@ ru@@ it and ve@@ ge@@ table cro@@ ps that we re@@ ly on for food is going up in pri@@ ce ."
So hon@@ ey@@ bees are important for their ro@@ le in the econom@@ y as well as in agri@@ culture .
"H@@ ere you can see some pi@@ ctures of what are called green ro@@ of@@ s , or urb@@ an agri@@ culture ."
We &apos;re fami@@ li@@ ar with the image on the left that shows a local neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od gar@@ den in the S@@ outh E@@ nd .
That &apos;s where I call home . I have a be@@ e@@ hi@@ ve in the back@@ y@@ ard .
"And per@@ haps a green ro@@ of in the future , when we &apos;re f@@ ur@@ ther u@@ ti@@ liz@@ ing urb@@ an are@@ as , where there are st@@ ac@@ ks of gar@@ den sp@@ ac@@ es ."
Ch@@ e@@ ck out this image ab@@ o@@ ve the or@@ ange line in B@@ ost@@ on .
T@@ ry to spo@@ t the be@@ e@@ hi@@ ve . It &apos;s there .
"It &apos;s on the ro@@ of@@ top , right on the cor@@ ner there , and it &apos;s been there for a couple of years now ."
"The way that urb@@ an be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ ping cur@@ r@@ ently oper@@ ates is that the be@@ e@@ hi@@ ves are quite hi@@ d@@ den , and it &apos;s not because they need to be ."
"It &apos;s just because people are un@@ comfor@@ table with the idea , and that &apos;s why I want you today to try to think about this , think about the b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts of bees in cities and why they really are a terri@@ fic thing ."
Let me give you a br@@ ie@@ f ru@@ n@@ down on how pol@@ lin@@ ation works .
"So we know f@@ low@@ ers , we know f@@ ru@@ its and ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les , even some al@@ fal@@ f@@ a in ha@@ y that the li@@ v@@ est@@ o@@ ck for the me@@ ats that we e@@ at , re@@ ly on pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors , but you &apos;ve got m@@ ale and fe@@ m@@ ale par@@ ts to a pl@@ ant here , and basically pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors are at@@ trac@@ ted to plan@@ ts for their ne@@ ct@@ ar , and in the process , a be@@ e will visi@@ t some f@@ low@@ ers and pi@@ ck up some pol@@ le@@ n , or that m@@ ale kind of sp@@ er@@ m coun@@ ter@@ part , along the way , and then tra@@ vel to different f@@ low@@ ers , and ev@@ en@@ tually an app@@ le , in this case , will be produ@@ ced ."
You can see the or@@ ien@@ tation . The stem is down .
"The blo@@ s@@ so@@ m end has fal@@ le@@ n off by the time we e@@ at it , but that &apos;s a basi@@ c over@@ view of how pol@@ lin@@ ation works ."
"And let &apos;s think about urb@@ an living , not today , and not in the past , but what about in a hundre@@ d years ?"
"What &apos;s it g@@ on@@ na look like ? We have huge gr@@ and challen@@ ges these days of ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at lo@@ ss . We have more and more people , bi@@ llions of people , in 100 years , God know@@ s how many people , and how little space there will be to f@@ it all of them , so we need to change the way that we see cities , and looking at this picture on the left of New York C@@ ity today , you can see how gra@@ y and b@@ row@@ n it is ."
"We have t@@ ar pa@@ per on the ro@@ of@@ top@@ s that b@@ oun@@ ces he@@ at back into the atmo@@ sp@@ here , con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ting to global clim@@ ate change , no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t ."
"What about in 100 years , if we have green ro@@ of@@ top@@ s every@@ where , and gar@@ den@@ ing , and we create our own cro@@ ps right in the cities ? We sa@@ ve on the co@@ sts of transpor@@ tation , we sa@@ ve on a health@@ ier d@@ ie@@ t , and we also edu@@ cate and create new j@@ ob@@ s lo@@ cally ."
We need bees for the future of our cities and urb@@ an living .
"H@@ ere &apos;s some data that we colle@@ cted through our company with B@@ est Be@@ es , where we deli@@ ver , in@@ st@@ all and man@@ age hon@@ ey@@ be@@ e hi@@ ves for any@@ body who wan@@ ts them , in the city , in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , and we in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce hon@@ ey@@ bees , and the idea of be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ ping in your own back@@ y@@ ard or ro@@ of@@ top or fi@@ re es@@ cape , for even that matter , and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is ."
"There &apos;s a coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive tr@@ end that we noti@@ ced in these num@@ bers . So let &apos;s look at the first me@@ tri@@ c here , over@@ w@@ inter@@ ing survi@@ v@@ al ."
"Now this has been a huge problem for many years , basically since the l@@ ate 19@@ 8@@ 0s , when the v@@ ar@@ ro@@ a mi@@ te came and brought many different vi@@ rus@@ es , bac@@ ter@@ ia and fun@@ g@@ al dise@@ ases with it ."
"O@@ ver@@ w@@ inter@@ ing suc@@ cess is hard , and that &apos;s when most of the col@@ on@@ ies are lost , and we found that in the cities , bees are survi@@ ving better than they are in the country ."
"A bit coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive , right ?"
"We think , oh , bees , coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , agri@@ culture , but that &apos;s not what the bees are show@@ ing ."
"The bees like it in the city . ( Laughter ) F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , they also produ@@ ce more hon@@ ey ."
The urb@@ an hon@@ ey is deli@@ ci@@ ous .
"The bees in B@@ ost@@ on on the ro@@ of@@ top of the Se@@ a@@ port H@@ ot@@ el , where we have hundre@@ ds of thousands of bees fl@@ ying over@@ heard right now that I &apos;m sure n@@ one of you noti@@ ced when we wal@@ ked by , are going to all of the local community gar@@ den@@ s and making deli@@ ci@@ ous , health@@ y hon@@ ey that just ta@@ st@@ es like the f@@ low@@ ers in our city ."
"So the y@@ ie@@ ld for urb@@ an hi@@ ves , in terms of hon@@ ey produ@@ ction , is high@@ er as well as the over@@ w@@ inter@@ ing survi@@ v@@ al , com@@ par@@ ed to ru@@ ral are@@ as ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , a bit coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive ."
"And looking back histori@@ cally at the ti@@ me@@ line of hon@@ ey@@ be@@ e health , we can go back to the year 9@@ 50 and see that there was also a great mor@@ t@@ ality of bees in I@@ rel@@ and ."
"So the problems of bees today isn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly something new . It has been happening since over a thous@@ and years ago , but what we don &apos;t really noti@@ ce are these problems in cities ."
So one thing I want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you to think about is the idea of what an urb@@ an is@@ land is .
You think in the city maybe the temper@@ ature &apos;s war@@ m@@ er .
Why are bees doing better in the city ?
This is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city .
P@@ er@@ haps there &apos;s more pol@@ le@@ n in the city .
"Wi@@ th the tra@@ ins coming in to urb@@ an hu@@ b@@ s , they can car@@ ry pol@@ le@@ n with them , very light pol@@ le@@ n , and it &apos;s just a big super@@ market in the city ."
A lot of lin@@ den tre@@ es live along the ra@@ il@@ ro@@ ad trac@@ ks .
P@@ er@@ haps there are fe@@ wer pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des in the cities than there are in &#91; ru@@ ral &#93; are@@ as .
"P@@ er@@ haps there are other things that we &apos;re just not thinking about yet , but that &apos;s one idea to think about , urb@@ an is@@ l@@ ands ."
"And col@@ ony col@@ lap@@ se di@@ sor@@ der is not the only thing af@@ fe@@ cting hon@@ ey@@ bees . H@@ on@@ ey@@ bees are dy@@ ing , and it &apos;s a huge , huge gr@@ and challen@@ ge of our time ."
"What you can see up here is a ma@@ p of the world , and we &apos;re trac@@ king the sp@@ read of this v@@ ar@@ ro@@ a mi@@ te ."
"Now , the v@@ ar@@ ro@@ a mi@@ te is what changed the g@@ ame in be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ ping , and you can see , at the top right , the years are chang@@ ing , we &apos;re coming up to moder@@ n times , and you can see the sp@@ read of the v@@ ar@@ ro@@ a mi@@ te from the early 19@@ 0@@ 0s through now ."
"It &apos;s 19@@ 6@@ 8 , and we &apos;re pretty much co@@ ver@@ ing A@@ si@@ a ."
"@@ 19@@ 7@@ 1 , we saw it sp@@ read to Europ@@ e and S@@ outh America , and then , when we get to the 19@@ 8@@ 0s , and speci@@ fi@@ cally to 19@@ 8@@ 7 , the v@@ ar@@ ro@@ a mi@@ te finally came to Nor@@ th America and to the United States , and that is when the g@@ ame changed for hon@@ ey@@ bees in the United States ."
"M@@ any of us will remember our chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od grow@@ ing up , maybe you got st@@ ung by a be@@ e , you saw bees on f@@ low@@ ers ."
Th@@ in@@ k of the kids today . Th@@ e@@ ir chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od &apos;s a bit different .
They don &apos;t experience this .
The bees just ar@@ en &apos;t around any@@ more .
So we need bees and they &apos;re disa@@ p@@ pe@@ aring and it &apos;s a big problem .
What can we do here ?
"So , what I do is hon@@ ey@@ be@@ e research ."
I got my P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . stu@@ dy@@ ing hon@@ ey@@ be@@ e health .
I started in 200@@ 5 stu@@ dy@@ ing hon@@ ey@@ bees .
"In 200@@ 6 , hon@@ ey@@ bees started disa@@ p@@ pe@@ aring , so sud@@ den@@ ly , like , this little ner@@ d kid going to school working with bu@@ gs — ( Laughter ) — became very rele@@ v@@ ant in the world ."
And it worked out that way .
So my research fo@@ c@@ uses on ways to make bees health@@ ier .
"I don &apos;t research what &apos;s kil@@ ling the bees , per se ."
I &apos;m not one of the many resear@@ ch@@ ers around the world who &apos;s looking at the effe@@ cts of pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des or dise@@ ases or ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at lo@@ ss and po@@ or n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion on bees .
"We &apos;re looking at ways to make bees health@@ ier through vac@@ cin@@ es , through y@@ og@@ ur@@ t , like pro@@ bi@@ oti@@ cs , and other typ@@ es of ther@@ a@@ pie@@ s in ways that can be f@@ ed or@@ ally to bees , and this process is so e@@ asy , even a 7@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old can do it ."
"You just mi@@ x up some pol@@ le@@ n , su@@ g@@ ar and water , and whatever ac@@ tive in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ t you want to put in , and you just give it right to the bees . No chemi@@ cal@@ s inv@@ olved , just im@@ mu@@ ne bo@@ ost@@ ers ."
H@@ um@@ ans think about our own health in a pro@@ spe@@ ctive way .
"We ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se , we e@@ at health@@ y , we take vi@@ tam@@ ins ."
Why don &apos;t we think about hon@@ ey@@ bees in that same ty@@ pe of way ?
B@@ ring them to are@@ as where they &apos;re th@@ ri@@ ving and try to make them health@@ ier before they get si@@ ck .
"I spent many years in gra@@ d school trying to po@@ ke bees and do vac@@ cin@@ es with need@@ les . ( Laughter ) Li@@ ke , years , years at the b@@ en@@ ch , &quot; &quot; Oh my go@@ sh , it &apos;s 3 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
"@@ and I &apos;m still pri@@ c@@ king bees . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then one day I said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we just do an or@@ al vac@@ cine ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; U@@ gh , &quot; &quot; so that &apos;s what we do . ( Laughter ) I &apos;d love to share with you some images of urb@@ an be@@ e@@ hi@@ ves , because they can be anything ."
"I mean , really open your mind with this ."
You can pa@@ int a hi@@ ve to mat@@ ch your home .
You can hi@@ de a hi@@ ve inside your home .
"These are three hi@@ ves on the ro@@ of@@ top of the F@@ air@@ mon@@ t C@@ op@@ ley P@@ la@@ za H@@ ot@@ el , and they &apos;re beautiful here . I mean , we mat@@ ched the new color of the inside of their ro@@ oms to do some ty@@ pe of a sta@@ ined wood with blue for their sh@@ e@@ ets , and these bees are terri@@ fic , and they also will use her@@ b@@ s that are grow@@ ing in the gar@@ den ."
"That &apos;s what the ch@@ ef@@ s go to to use for their co@@ o@@ king , and the hon@@ ey — they do live ev@@ ents — they &apos;ll use that hon@@ ey at their bar@@ s ."
H@@ on@@ ey is a great n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ti@@ onal sub@@ stitu@@ te for regu@@ lar su@@ g@@ ar because there are different typ@@ es of su@@ gar@@ s in there .
"We also have a clas@@ s@@ room hi@@ ves project , where — this is a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it ven@@ ture — we &apos;re sp@@ re@@ ading the word around the world for how hon@@ ey@@ be@@ e hi@@ ves can be taken into the clas@@ s@@ room or into the mus@@ e@@ um se@@ tting , behind gl@@ as@@ s , and used as an edu@@ c@@ ational to@@ ol ."
This hi@@ ve that you see here has been in F@@ en@@ way Hi@@ gh S@@ cho@@ ol for many years now .
The bees f@@ ly right into the out@@ fie@@ ld of F@@ en@@ way Par@@ k .
"N@@ ob@@ ody noti@@ ces it . If you &apos;re not a f@@ low@@ er , these bees do not care about you . ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t . They don &apos;t . They &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; S &apos;@@ c@@ use me , fl@@ ying around . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) S@@ ome other images here in tel@@ ling a part of the story that really made urb@@ an be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ ping terri@@ fic is in New York C@@ ity , be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ ping was il@@ leg@@ al until 20@@ 10 ."
"That &apos;s a big problem , because what &apos;s going to pol@@ lin@@ ate all of the gar@@ den@@ s and the produ@@ ce lo@@ cally ? H@@ ands ?"
"I mean , lo@@ cally in B@@ ost@@ on , there is a terri@@ fic company called Gre@@ en C@@ ity G@@ row@@ ers , and they are going and pol@@ lin@@ ating their squ@@ as@@ h cro@@ ps by hand with Q@@ -@@ Ti@@ ps , and if they mi@@ ss that three day win@@ do@@ w , there &apos;s no f@@ ru@@ it ."
"Th@@ e@@ ir cl@@ ien@@ ts ar@@ en &apos;t happy , and people go hun@@ g@@ ry ."
So this is important .
We have also some images of hon@@ ey from B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n .
"Now , this was a m@@ yst@@ ery in the New York T@@ im@@ es where the hon@@ ey was very red , and the New York St@@ ate for@@ en@@ si@@ cs de@@ part@@ ment came in and they actually did some science to mat@@ ch the red dy@@ e with that found in a mar@@ as@@ ch@@ in@@ o ch@@ er@@ ry fac@@ t@@ ory down the stre@@ et . ( Laughter ) So you can ta@@ i@@ lor your hon@@ ey to ta@@ ste h@@ ow@@ ever you want by plan@@ ting be@@ e-@@ frien@@ d@@ ly f@@ low@@ ers ."

What can you do to sa@@ ve the bees or to help them or to think of susta@@ in@@ able cities in the future ?
"Well , really , just change your perspe@@ ctive ."
T@@ ry to understand that bees are very important .
A be@@ e isn &apos;t going to st@@ ing you if you see it .
"The be@@ e d@@ ies . H@@ on@@ ey@@ bees die when they st@@ ing , so they don &apos;t want to do it either . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s nothing to p@@ ani@@ c about . They &apos;re all over the city ."
You could even get your own hi@@ ve if you want .

S@@ wal@@ low@@ ing pi@@ l@@ ls is the most effe@@ ctive and pain@@ less way of deli@@ ver@@ ing any medi@@ cation in the body .
"The dow@@ n@@ side , though , is that s@@ wal@@ low@@ ing any medi@@ cation le@@ ads to its di@@ lu@@ tion ."
"And this is a big problem , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly in HIV patients ."
"When they take their anti@@ -@@ HIV dru@@ gs , these dru@@ gs are good for low@@ ering the vi@@ ru@@ s in the blo@@ od , and incre@@ as@@ ing the C@@ D@@ 4 cell coun@@ ts ."
"But they are also not@@ ori@@ ous for their ad@@ verse side effe@@ cts , but mo@@ st@@ ly bad , because they get di@@ lu@@ ted by the time they get to the blo@@ od , and wor@@ se , by the time they get to the si@@ tes where it mat@@ ters most : within the HIV vi@@ ral re@@ ser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s ."
"These are@@ as in the body — such as the ly@@ m@@ ph no@@ des , the ner@@ v@@ ous system , as well as the lu@@ n@@ gs — where the vi@@ ru@@ s is sle@@ e@@ ping , and will not re@@ ad@@ i@@ ly get deli@@ vered in the blo@@ od of patients that are under consi@@ st@@ ent anti@@ -@@ HIV dru@@ gs ther@@ ap@@ y ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , upo@@ n dis@@ contin@@ u@@ ation of ther@@ ap@@ y , the vi@@ ru@@ s can a@@ wa@@ ke and in@@ fe@@ ct new cells in the blo@@ od ."
"Now , all this is a big problem in tre@@ ating HIV with the cur@@ r@@ ent dru@@ g tre@@ at@@ ment , which is a li@@ fe@@ -@@ long tre@@ at@@ ment that must be s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed by patients ."
"One day , I s@@ at and thought , &quot; &quot; C@@ an we deli@@ ver anti@@ -@@ HIV dire@@ ct@@ ly within its re@@ ser@@ vo@@ ir si@@ tes , without the ri@@ sk of dru@@ g di@@ lu@@ tion ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s a las@@ er scienti@@ st , the answer was just before my eyes : L@@ as@@ ers , of course ."
"If they can be used for den@@ ti@@ stry , for di@@ a@@ be@@ tic w@@ oun@@ d-@@ heal@@ ing and sur@@ g@@ ery , they can be used for anything imag@@ in@@ able , inclu@@ ding transpor@@ ting dru@@ gs into cells ."
"As a matter of fact , we are cur@@ r@@ ently using las@@ er pul@@ ses to po@@ ke or dri@@ ll extre@@ me@@ ly t@@ iny ho@@ les , which open and close almost im@@ medi@@ ately in H@@ I@@ V@@ -@@ in@@ fe@@ cted cells , in order to deli@@ ver dru@@ gs within them ."
&quot; &quot; How is that possible ? &quot; &quot; you may ask .
"Well , we sh@@ ine a very powerful but super@@ -@@ t@@ iny las@@ er be@@ am on@@ to the mem@@ br@@ ane of H@@ I@@ V@@ -@@ in@@ fe@@ cted cells while these cells are im@@ mer@@ sed in li@@ qu@@ id con@@ ta@@ ining the dru@@ g ."

"Now , we are cur@@ r@@ ently test@@ ing this technology in test tu@@ be@@ s or in Pe@@ tr@@ i di@@ sh@@ es , but the go@@ al is to get this technology in the human body , app@@ ly it in the human body ."
&quot; &quot; How is that possible ? &quot; &quot; you may ask .
"Well , the answer is : through a thre@@ e-@@ he@@ ad@@ ed de@@ vice ."
"U@@ sing the first head , which is our las@@ er , we will make an in@@ ci@@ sion in the site of in@@ fe@@ ction ."
"U@@ sing the second head , which is a cam@@ era , we me@@ an@@ der to the site of in@@ fe@@ ction ."

"Well , this might not se@@ em like much right now ."
"But one day , if suc@@ cess@@ ful , this technology can le@@ ad to comple@@ te er@@ ad@@ i@@ cation of HIV in the body ."

"They &apos;re just about the most powerful words we can say to one another , and often that &apos;s what happens in a St@@ ory@@ C@@ or@@ ps bo@@ ot@@ h ."
"It &apos;s a ch@@ ance to have a sense of clo@@ sure with someone you care about — no re@@ gre@@ ts , nothing left un@@ said ."
"And it &apos;s hard and it takes cou@@ ra@@ ge , but that &apos;s why we &apos;re ali@@ ve , right ?"
"So , the TED P@@ ri@@ ze ."
"When I first heard from TED and Ch@@ ris a few months ago about the possi@@ bility of the P@@ ri@@ ze , I was completely f@@ loo@@ red ."
"They asked me to come up with a very br@@ ie@@ f wi@@ sh for hum@@ ani@@ ty , no more than 50 words ."

"It has a micro@@ phone , it can tell you how to do things , and it can sen@@ d au@@ di@@ o fi@@ les ."
Th@@ ose are the key in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ ts .
So the first part of the wi@@ sh is already under@@ way .
"O@@ ver the past couple of months , the team at St@@ ory@@ C@@ or@@ ps has been working fu@@ ri@@ ously to create an ap@@ p that will bring St@@ ory@@ C@@ or@@ ps out of our boo@@ ths so that it can be exper@@ ien@@ ced by any@@ one , any@@ where , any@@ time ."

and how they want to be re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed .

I hope you &apos;ll help us make this wi@@ sh come true .
"In@@ ter@@ view a family member , a friend or even a str@@ ang@@ er ."

"( Applause ) N@@ ew@@ ton A@@ du@@ ak@@ a : Thank you . The first cli@@ p , really , is tot@@ ally trying to cap@@ ture what cin@@ em@@ a is for me , and where I &apos;m coming from in terms of cin@@ em@@ a ."
"The first piece was , really , there &apos;s a young woman talking about Nigeri@@ a , that she has a feeling she &apos;ll be happy there ."
These are the sen@@ ti@@ ments of someone that &apos;s been away from home .
"And that was something that I went through , you know , and I &apos;m still going through ."
"I &apos;ve not been home for quite a while , for about five years now ."
I &apos;ve been away 20 years in tot@@ al .
"And so it ’ s really — it &apos;s really how sud@@ den@@ ly , you know , this was made in 199@@ 7 , which is the time of A@@ b@@ ach@@ a — the mi@@ lit@@ ary di@@ ct@@ at@@ or@@ ship , the wor@@ st part of Nigeri@@ an history , this post@@ -@@ col@@ oni@@ al history ."
"So , for this girl to have these dre@@ am@@ s is simply how we pre@@ ser@@ ve a sense of what home is ."
"H@@ ow — and it &apos;s sort of , per@@ haps ro@@ man@@ tic , but I think beautiful , because you just need something to h@@ old on to , es@@ pe@@ cially in a society where you feel al@@ ien@@ ated ."
"Wh@@ ich takes us to the next piece , where the young man tal@@ ks about l@@ ack of opportunity : living as a black person in Europ@@ e , the gl@@ as@@ s ce@@ il@@ ing that we all know about , that we all talk about , and his re@@ ality ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , this was my — this was me talking about — this was , again , the time of mul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tur@@ ali@@ sm in the United K@@ ing@@ dom , and there was this bu@@ z@@ z@@ word — and it was trying to say , what exactly does this mul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tur@@ ali@@ sm mean in the real lives of people ?"
"And what would a child — what does a child like J@@ am@@ ie — the young bo@@ y — think , I mean , with all this ang@@ er that &apos;s built up inside of him ?"
What happens with that ?
"What , of course , happens with that is violence , which we see when we talk about the gh@@ et@@ to@@ s and we talk about , you know , S@@ outh C@@ ent@@ ral L@@ .@@ A@@ . and this kind of stuff , and which ev@@ en@@ tually , when ch@@ an@@ ne@@ led , be@@ comes , you know , ev@@ ol@@ ves and m@@ ani@@ fe@@ sts itself as ri@@ ots — like the one in Fran@@ ce two years ago , where I live , which sh@@ oc@@ ked everybody , because everyone thought , &quot; &quot; Oh well , Fran@@ ce is a li@@ ber@@ al society . &quot; &quot; But I li@@ ved in En@@ gl@@ and for 18 years ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in Fran@@ ce for about four , and I feel actually th@@ row@@ n back 20 years , living in Fran@@ ce ."
"And then , the third piece . The third piece for me is the question : What is cin@@ em@@ a to you ? What do you do with cin@@ em@@ a ?"
"There &apos;s a young dire@@ ctor , H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood dire@@ ctor , with his friends — fel@@ low fil@@ m@@ mak@@ ers — talking about what cin@@ em@@ a means ."
I sup@@ pos@@ e that will take me to my last piece — what cin@@ em@@ a means for me .
"My life started as a — I started life in 19@@ 6@@ 6 , a few months before the Bi@@ af@@ ran , which la@@ st@@ ed for three years and it was three years of war ."
"So that whole thing , that whole chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od e@@ cho@@ es and takes me into the next piece ."

One of the the@@ mes that comes through very stron@@ g@@ ly in the piece we just wat@@ ched is this sense of the psycho@@ logi@@ cal tra@@ um@@ a of the young that have to play this ro@@ le of being child sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s .
"And consi@@ der@@ ing where you are coming from , and when we consi@@ der the ex@@ t@@ ent to which it ’ s not taken as seri@@ ously as it should be , what would you have to say about that ?"
"N@@ A : In the process of my research , I actually spent a bit of time in S@@ ier@@ ra Le@@ one resear@@ ching this ."
"And I remember I met a lot of child sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s — ex@@ -@@ com@@ bat@@ an@@ ts , as they like to be called ."
I met psycho@@ social wor@@ k@@ ers who worked with them .
"I met psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ sts who spent time with them , a@@ id wor@@ k@@ ers , N@@ G@@ O@@ s , the whole lot ."
"But I remember on the f@@ light back on my last tri@@ p , I remember bre@@ aking down in te@@ ars and thinking to myself , if any kid in the W@@ est , in the we@@ ster@@ n world , went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through , they will be in ther@@ ap@@ y for the rest of their natural lives ."
"So for me , the thought that we have all these children — it ’ s a gener@@ ation , we have a whole gener@@ ation of children — who have been put through so much psycho@@ logi@@ cal tra@@ um@@ a or dam@@ age , and Africa has to live with that ."
"But I ’ m just saying to fac@@ tor that in , fac@@ tor that in with all this great adv@@ an@@ c@@ ement , all this pro@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ement of great ach@@ ie@@ v@@ ement ."

( Applause )
H@@ i there .
"I &apos;m going to be talking a little bit about music , mach@@ ines and life ."
"O@@ r , more speci@@ fi@@ cally , what we learned from the cre@@ ation of a very large and comp@@ lic@@ ated mach@@ ine for a music video ."
S@@ ome of you may re@@ cogni@@ ze this image .
This is the open@@ ing fra@@ me of the video that we created .
"We &apos;ll be show@@ ing the video at the end , but before we do , I want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted ."
"Now , when we first started talking to OK G@@ o — the name of the s@@ ong is &quot; &quot; This T@@ o@@ o S@@ h@@ all P@@ as@@ s &quot; &quot; — we were really exci@@ ted because they ex@@ pres@@ sed inter@@ est in building a mach@@ ine that they could dance with ."
"And we were very exci@@ ted about this because , of course , they have a history of dan@@ cing with mach@@ ines ."
"They &apos;re respon@@ si@@ ble for this video , &quot; &quot; Here It Go@@ es A@@ ga@@ in . &quot; &quot; 5@@ 0-@@ mi@@ lli@@ on-@@ p@@ lu@@ s vie@@ ws on Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be ."
"F@@ our guys dan@@ cing on tre@@ ad@@ mi@@ l@@ ls , no cu@@ ts , just a st@@ atic cam@@ era ."
A fanta@@ sti@@ cally vi@@ ral and wonderful video .
So we were really exci@@ ted about working with them .
And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted .
And they expla@@ ined that they wanted kind of a R@@ u@@ be G@@ ol@@ d@@ ber@@ g mach@@ ine .
"Now , for those of you who don &apos;t know , a R@@ u@@ be G@@ ol@@ d@@ ber@@ g mach@@ ine is a comp@@ lic@@ ated con@@ tra@@ ption , an incredi@@ bly over@@ -@@ engine@@ er@@ ed piece of mach@@ in@@ ery that ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ es a relati@@ vely simple t@@ ask ."
"So we were exci@@ ted by this idea , and we started talking about exactly what it would look like ."
"And we came up with some par@@ am@@ e@@ ters , because , you know , building a R@@ u@@ be G@@ ol@@ d@@ ber@@ g mach@@ ine has li@@ mi@@ t@@ ations , but it also is pretty wi@@ de open ."
And we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video .
"So we came up with a li@@ st of requi@@ re@@ ments , the &quot; &quot; 10 comm@@ and@@ ments , &quot; &quot; and they were , in order of as@@ cen@@ ding difficul@@ ty : The first is &quot; &quot; No mag@@ ic . &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing that happened on scre@@ en had to be very e@@ a@@ si@@ ly under@@ sto@@ od by a ty@@ pi@@ cal vie@@ wer ."
"The ru@@ le of th@@ um@@ b was that , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video ."
"They wanted b@@ and inte@@ gr@@ ation , that is , the mach@@ ine ac@@ ting upo@@ n the b@@ and mem@@ bers , speci@@ fi@@ cally not the other way around ."
They wanted the mach@@ ine action to fol@@ low the s@@ ong feeling .
"So as the s@@ ong pi@@ cks up emoti@@ on , so should the mach@@ ine get gran@@ der in its process ."
They wanted us to make use of the space .
"So we have this 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ squ@@ are@@ -@@ fo@@ ot war@@ e@@ house we were using , di@@ vi@@ ded between two flo@@ ors ."
It inclu@@ ded an ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or lo@@ ading do@@ ck .
"We used all of that , inclu@@ ding a gi@@ ant ho@@ le in the flo@@ or that we actually des@@ cen@@ ded the cam@@ era and cam@@ er@@ am@@ an through ."
"They wanted it mess@@ y , and we were happy to ob@@ li@@ ge ."
The mach@@ ine itself would start the music .
"So the mach@@ ine would get started , it would tra@@ vel some di@@ stance , re@@ ac@@ ting along the way , h@@ it play on an i@@ P@@ od or a ta@@ pe de@@ ck or something that would start pla@@ y@@ back ."
And the mach@@ ine would ma@@ in@@ tain syn@@ chro@@ ni@@ z@@ ation throu@@ gh@@ out .
"And spe@@ aking of syn@@ chro@@ ni@@ z@@ ation , they wanted it to syn@@ c to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m and to h@@ it speci@@ fic be@@ ats along the way ."
O@@ kay . ( Laughter ) They wanted it to end pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly on time .
"O@@ kay , so now the start to fin@@ is@@ h ti@@ ming has to be perfe@@ ct ."
And they wanted the music to dro@@ p out at a certain point in the video and ac@@ tu@@ al live au@@ di@@ o from the mach@@ ine to play part of the s@@ ong .
"And as if that wasn &apos;t enough , all of these incredi@@ bly comp@@ lic@@ ating things , right , they wanted it in one sh@@ ot ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) O@@ kay .
"So , just some st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs about what we went through in the process ."
The mach@@ ine itself has 8@@ 9 di@@ st@@ in@@ ct inter@@ ac@@ tions .
It took us 8@@ 5 takes to get it on film to our s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion .
"O@@ f those 8@@ 5 takes , only three actually suc@@ cess@@ fully comple@@ ted their run ."
We de@@ stro@@ yed two pi@@ an@@ os and 10 tele@@ vi@@ sions in the process .
We went to H@@ ome De@@ po@@ t well over a hundre@@ d times .
"( Laughter ) And we lost one high-@@ he@@ e@@ led sho@@ e when one of our engine@@ ers , H@@ e@@ a@@ ther K@@ night , left her high-@@ he@@ e@@ led sho@@ e — after a nice din@@ ner , and re@@ turned back to the build — and left it in a pi@@ le of stuff ."
"And another engine@@ er thought , &quot; &quot; Well , that would be a really good thing to use &quot; &quot; and en@@ ded up using it as a really nice tri@@ g@@ ger ."
And it &apos;s actually in the mach@@ ine .
So what did we learn from all of this ?
"Well , having comple@@ ted this , we have the opportunity to ste@@ p back and ref@@ le@@ ct on some of the things ."
And we learned that small stuff st@@ in@@ ks .
"L@@ it@@ tle bal@@ ls in wo@@ o@@ den trac@@ ks are really s@@ us@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble to hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty and temper@@ ature and a little bit of d@@ ust , and they f@@ all out of the trac@@ ks , the ex@@ act ang@@ les makes it hard to get right ."
"And yet , a bow@@ ling ball will always fol@@ low the same pat@@ h ."
"It doesn &apos;t matter what temper@@ ature it is , doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s in its way ; it will pretty much get where it needs to go ."
"But as much as the small stuff st@@ in@@ ks , we needed some@@ where to start , so that we would have some@@ where to go ."
And so you have to start with it . You have to fo@@ cus on it .
"S@@ mall stuff st@@ in@@ ks , but , of course , it &apos;s essen@@ tial , right ?"
What else ? P@@ lan@@ ning is incredi@@ bly important .
"( Laughter ) You know , we spent a lot of time ide@@ ating and even building some of these things ."
"It &apos;s been said that , &quot; &quot; No bat@@ tle pl@@ an survi@@ ves cont@@ act with the ene@@ my . &quot; &quot; I think our ene@@ my was physi@@ cs — ( Laughter ) and she &apos;s a c@@ ru@@ el mi@@ stre@@ ss ."
"O@@ f@@ ten , we had to pu@@ ll things out as a resul@@ t because of ti@@ ming or a@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ cs or whatever ."
"And so while plan@@ ning is important , so is f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility ."
These are all things that en@@ ded up not making it into the fin@@ al mach@@ ine .
"So also , put reli@@ able stuff last , the stuff that &apos;s going to run every time ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , small to large is rele@@ v@@ ant here ."
"The little L@@ ego car in the beginning of the video re@@ fer@@ ences the big , real car ne@@ ar the end of the video ."
"The big , real car works every time ; there &apos;s no problem about it ."
The little one had a ten@@ den@@ cy to try to run off the tr@@ ack and that &apos;s a problem .
"But you don &apos;t want to have to re@@ set the whole mach@@ ine because the L@@ ego car at the end doesn &apos;t work , right ."
"So you put that up front so that , if it fa@@ il@@ s , at least you know you don &apos;t have to re@@ set the whole thing ."
Li@@ fe can be mess@@ y .
There were incredi@@ bly difficult mom@@ ents in the building of this thing .
"M@@ on@@ ths were spent in this t@@ iny , c@@ old war@@ e@@ house ."
And the wonderful el@@ ation that we had when we finally comple@@ ted it .
"So it &apos;s important to remember that whether it &apos;s good or it &apos;s bad , &quot; This T@@ o@@ o S@@ h@@ all P@@ as@@ s . &quot;"
Thank you very much .

It was more at@@ onal and tw@@ el@@ ve@@ -@@ t@@ one .
And he in@@ si@@ st@@ ed on beautiful music .
So this is &quot; &quot; O@@ bli@@ vi@@ on &quot; &quot; by A@@ st@@ or P@@ i@@ az@@ z@@ ol@@ la .

"The K@@ ra@@ k@@ en , a be@@ ast so terri@@ f@@ ying it was said to de@@ v@@ our men and ships and wh@@ al@@ es , and so en@@ or@@ m@@ ous it could be mist@@ ak@@ en for an is@@ land ."
"In as@@ s@@ ess@@ ing the m@@ eri@@ ts of such tal@@ es , it &apos;s probably wi@@ se to keep in mind that old sa@@ i@@ lor &apos;s saw that the only difference between a fai@@ ry@@ t@@ ale and a se@@ a story is a fai@@ ry@@ t@@ ale begin@@ s , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce upo@@ n a time , &quot; &quot; and a se@@ a story begin@@ s , &quot; &quot; This a@@ in &apos;t no sh@@ it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ very fish that gets away grow@@ s with every tel@@ ling of the t@@ ale ."

I was one of the three scienti@@ sts on this expe@@ di@@ tion that took place last sum@@ m@@ er off J@@ ap@@ an .

I owe my parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation in this now@@ -@@ histor@@ ic ev@@ ent to TED .
"In 20@@ 10 , there was a TED ev@@ ent called M@@ is@@ sion B@@ lu@@ e he@@ ld ab@@ o@@ ard the L@@ in@@ d@@ bl@@ ad E@@ x@@ plo@@ re@@ r in the G@@ al@@ a@@ pa@@ go@@ s as part of the fu@@ l@@ fil@@ l@@ ment of Sy@@ l@@ vi@@ a Ear@@ le &apos;s TED wi@@ sh ."
"I spo@@ ke about a new way of expl@@ or@@ ing the ocean , one that fo@@ c@@ uses on at@@ trac@@ ting animals instead of sc@@ aring them away ."
"M@@ i@@ ke de@@ G@@ ru@@ y was also in@@ vi@@ ted , and he spo@@ ke with great pas@@ sion about his love of the ocean , and he also tal@@ ked to me about ap@@ pl@@ ying my appro@@ ach to something he &apos;s been inv@@ olved with for a very long time , which is the hun@@ t for the gi@@ ant squ@@ id ."
"It was Mi@@ ke that got me in@@ vi@@ ted to the squ@@ id sum@@ m@@ it , a ga@@ ther@@ ing of squ@@ id exper@@ ts at the D@@ is@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l that sum@@ m@@ er during S@@ har@@ k W@@ e@@ ek . ( Laughter ) I gave a talk on u@@ no@@ b@@ tru@@ sive vie@@ w@@ ing and op@@ tical lu@@ ring of de@@ ep se@@ a squ@@ id in which I em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ zed the import@@ ance of using qu@@ ie@@ t , u@@ no@@ b@@ tru@@ sive pl@@ at@@ form@@ s for expl@@ or@@ ation ."
"This came out of hundre@@ ds of di@@ ves I have made , far@@ ting around in the dar@@ k using these pl@@ at@@ form@@ s , and my im@@ pres@@ sion that I saw more animals working from the sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble than I did with either of the re@@ mot@@ e-@@ oper@@ ated ve@@ hi@@ cles ."
But that could just be because the sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble has a wi@@ der fie@@ ld of view .
"But I also felt like I saw more animals working with the Ti@@ bu@@ ro@@ n than the V@@ ent@@ ana , two ve@@ hi@@ cles with the same fie@@ ld of view but different pro@@ pul@@ sion systems ."
So my s@@ us@@ pi@@ ci@@ on was that it might have something to do with the amount of no@@ ise they make .
"So I set up a hy@@ dro@@ phone on the bot@@ tom of the ocean , and I had each of these f@@ ly by at the same speed and di@@ stance and recor@@ ded the sound they made ."
"The Joh@@ n@@ son Se@@ a@@ -@@ L@@ in@@ k — ( wh@@ ir@@ ring no@@ ise ) — which you can probably just bar@@ ely hear here , uses electri@@ c th@@ ru@@ st@@ ers — very , very qu@@ ie@@ t ."
The Ti@@ bu@@ ro@@ n also uses electri@@ c power@@ ed th@@ ru@@ st@@ ers .
"It &apos;s also pretty qu@@ ie@@ t , but a bit no@@ is@@ ier . ( L@@ ou@@ der wh@@ ir@@ ring no@@ ise ) But most de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ di@@ ving R@@ O@@ V@@ s these days use hy@@ dra@@ uli@@ cs and they sound like the V@@ ent@@ ana . ( L@@ ou@@ d be@@ e@@ ping no@@ ise ) I think that &apos;s got to be sc@@ aring a lot of animals away ."
"So for the de@@ ep se@@ a squ@@ id hun@@ t , I pro@@ posed using an op@@ tical lu@@ re att@@ ach@@ ed to a cam@@ era pl@@ at@@ form with no th@@ ru@@ st@@ ers , no mot@@ ors , just a bat@@ ter@@ y@@ -@@ power@@ ed cam@@ era , and the only il@@ lu@@ min@@ ation coming from red light that &apos;s in@@ visi@@ ble to most de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ se@@ a animals that are ad@@ ap@@ ted to see pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly blue ."
"That &apos;s visi@@ ble to our ey@@ e , but it &apos;s the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of in@@ fr@@ ared in the de@@ ep se@@ a ."
"So this cam@@ era pl@@ at@@ form , which we called the M@@ ed@@ us@@ a , could just be th@@ row@@ n off the back of the ship , att@@ ach@@ ed to a flo@@ at at the surface with over 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et of line , it would just flo@@ at around pas@@ si@@ vely car@@ ried by the cur@@ r@@ ents , and the only light visi@@ ble to the animals in the de@@ ep would be the blue light of the op@@ tical lu@@ re , which we called the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish , or e-@@ je@@ lly , because it was desig@@ ned to imi@@ t@@ ate the bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent disp@@ l@@ ay of the common de@@ ep se@@ a je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish At@@ ol@@ la ."
"Now , this p@@ in@@ whe@@ el of light that the At@@ ol@@ la produ@@ ces is known as a bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent bur@@ gl@@ ar al@@ ar@@ m and is a form of def@@ en@@ se ."
"The reason that the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish worked as a lu@@ re is not because gi@@ ant squ@@ id e@@ at je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish , but it &apos;s because this je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish only re@@ sor@@ ts to produ@@ cing this light when it &apos;s being ch@@ ew@@ ed on by a pre@@ d@@ ator and its only hope for es@@ cape may be to at@@ trac@@ t the at@@ ten@@ tion of a lar@@ ger pre@@ d@@ ator that will att@@ ack its att@@ ac@@ k@@ er and ther@@ e@@ by af@@ for@@ d it an opportunity for es@@ cape ."
"It &apos;s a scre@@ am for help , a la@@ st@@ -@@ di@@ t@@ ch at@@ tem@@ pt for es@@ cape , and a common form of def@@ en@@ se in the de@@ ep se@@ a ."
The appro@@ ach worked .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as all pre@@ vi@@ ous expe@@ di@@ tions had fai@@ led to gar@@ ner a single video g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of the gi@@ ant , we man@@ aged six , and the first tri@@ gg@@ er@@ ed wi@@ ld exci@@ tem@@ ent ."
E@@ di@@ th Wi@@ d@@ der ( on video ) : Oh my God . Oh my God ! A@@ re you ki@@ d@@ ding me ? O@@ ther scienti@@ sts : Oh h@@ o h@@ o ! That &apos;s just h@@ ang@@ ing there .
"E@@ W : It was like it was te@@ as@@ ing us , doing a kind of f@@ an dance — now you see me , now you don &apos;t — and we had four such te@@ as@@ ing ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ an@@ ces , and then on the fi@@ f@@ th , it came in and tot@@ ally w@@ ow@@ ed us ."
( Music ) N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : ( S@@ pe@@ aking in J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese ) S@@ cien@@ ti@@ sts : O@@ oh . B@@ an@@ g ! Oh my God ! Wh@@ o@@ a !
( Applause ) E@@ W : The full mon@@ ty .
"What really w@@ ow@@ ed me about that was the way it came in up over the e-@@ je@@ lly and then att@@ ac@@ ked the en@@ or@@ m@@ ous thing next to it , which I think it mi@@ sto@@ ok for the pre@@ d@@ ator on the e-@@ je@@ lly ."
But even more incredible was the fo@@ ot@@ age sh@@ ot from the T@@ ri@@ ton sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble .
"What was not men@@ tion@@ ed in the D@@ is@@ co@@ very do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ary was that the ba@@ it squ@@ id that D@@ r. K@@ u@@ bod@@ era used , a one@@ -@@ me@@ ter long di@@ am@@ on@@ d@@ back squ@@ id had a light att@@ ach@@ ed to it , a squ@@ id j@@ i@@ g of the ty@@ pe that lon@@ gl@@ ine fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men use , and I think it was this light that brought the gi@@ ant in ."
"Now , what you &apos;re seeing is the inten@@ si@@ f@@ ied cam@@ era &apos;s view under red light , and that &apos;s all D@@ r. K@@ u@@ bod@@ era could see when the gi@@ ant comes in here ."
"And then he got so exci@@ ted , he turned on his f@@ las@@ h@@ light because he wanted to see better , and the gi@@ ant didn &apos;t run away , so he ri@@ sk@@ ed tur@@ ning on the white li@@ ghts on the sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , br@@ ing@@ ing a cre@@ ature of leg@@ end from the mist@@ y history into high-@@ re@@ solution video ."
"It was absolu@@ tely bre@@ a@@ th@@ taking , and had this ani@@ mal had its fe@@ e@@ ding t@@ ent@@ ac@@ les in@@ t@@ act and fully ex@@ ten@@ ded , it would have been as t@@ all as a two@@ -@@ story house ."
How could something that big live in our ocean and yet re@@ ma@@ in un@@ fil@@ med until now ?
We &apos;ve only ex@@ plo@@ red about five percent of our ocean .
"There are great disco@@ ver@@ ies yet to be made down there , fanta@@ stic cre@@ at@@ ures re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing mi@@ llions of years of ev@@ olution and possi@@ bly bio@@ ac@@ tive com@@ po@@ un@@ ds that could b@@ en@@ ef@@ it us in ways that we can &apos;t even yet imagine ."
Y@@ et we have spent only a t@@ iny f@@ rac@@ tion of the money on ocean expl@@ or@@ ation that we &apos;ve spent on space expl@@ or@@ ation .
"We need a N@@ A@@ S@@ A@@ -@@ like organiz@@ ation for ocean expl@@ or@@ ation , because we need to be expl@@ or@@ ing and prote@@ cting our life sup@@ port systems here on Earth ."
We need — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) E@@ x@@ pl@@ or@@ ation is the eng@@ ine that dri@@ ves in@@ no@@ vation .
In@@ no@@ vation dri@@ ves economic grow@@ th .
"So let &apos;s all go expl@@ or@@ ing , but let &apos;s do it in a way that doesn &apos;t sc@@ are the animals away , or , as Mi@@ ke de@@ G@@ ru@@ y once said , &quot; &quot; If you want to get away from it all and see something you &apos;ve never seen , or have an ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent ch@@ ance of seeing something that no one &apos;s ever seen , get in a su@@ b . &quot; &quot; He should have been with us for this ad@@ ven@@ ture ."
We mi@@ ss him .
( Applause )
The first idea I &apos;d like to su@@ ggest is that we all love music a great deal . It means a lot to us .
"But music is even more powerful if you don &apos;t just list@@ en to it , but you make it yourself ."
"So , that &apos;s my first idea . And we all know about the Mo@@ zar@@ t effe@@ ct — the idea that &apos;s been around for the last five to 10 years — that just by list@@ ening to music or by playing music to your b@@ aby &#91; in u@@ ter@@ o &#93; , that it &apos;ll ra@@ ise our I@@ Q poin@@ ts 10 , 20 , 30 percent ."
"G@@ re@@ at idea , but it doesn &apos;t work at all ."
"So , you can &apos;t just list@@ en to music , you have to make it some@@ how ."
"And I &apos;d ad@@ d to that , that it &apos;s not just making it , but everybody , each of us , everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c way , and that &apos;s one of the ma@@ in par@@ ts of my work ."
"So , with the M@@ I@@ T Me@@ di@@ a L@@ a@@ b , for quite a while now , we &apos;ve been eng@@ aged in a fie@@ ld called ac@@ tive music ."
"What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the mi@@ ddle of a musi@@ cal experience , not just list@@ ening , but making music ?"
"And we started by making instru@@ ments for some of the world &apos;s gre@@ at@@ est perform@@ ers — we call these hy@@ per@@ instru@@ ments — for Y@@ o@@ -@@ Y@@ o M@@ a , Pe@@ ter G@@ ab@@ r@@ ie@@ l , P@@ r@@ in@@ ce , or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra@@ s , ro@@ ck b@@ ands . In@@ stru@@ ments where they &apos;re all kinds of sen@@ sor@@ s built right into the instru@@ ment , so the instru@@ ment know@@ s how it &apos;s being pla@@ yed ."
"And just by chang@@ ing the inter@@ pret@@ ation and the feeling , I can turn my cel@@ l@@ o into a vo@@ ice , or into a whole or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra , or into something that no@@ body has ever heard before ."
"When we started making these , I started thinking , why can &apos;t we make wonderful instru@@ ments like that for everybody , people who ar@@ en &apos;t fanta@@ stic Y@@ o@@ -@@ Y@@ o M@@ as or P@@ r@@ in@@ ces ?"
"So , we &apos;ve made a whole ser@@ ies of instru@@ ments ."
One of the largest colle@@ ctions is called the Bra@@ in O@@ per@@ a .
"It &apos;s a whole or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra of about 100 instru@@ ments , all desig@@ ned for any@@ body to play using natural sk@@ i@@ ll ."
"So , you can play a video g@@ ame , dri@@ ve through a piece of music , use your body g@@ est@@ ure to control huge mas@@ ses of sound , tou@@ ch a spe@@ cial surface to make me@@ lo@@ d@@ ies , use your vo@@ ice to make a whole au@@ ra ."
"And when we make the Bra@@ in O@@ per@@ a , we in@@ vi@@ te the public to come in , to try these instru@@ ments and then col@@ labor@@ ate with us to help make each perform@@ ance of the Bra@@ in O@@ per@@ a ."
"We tou@@ red that for a long time . It is now per@@ man@@ ently in V@@ ien@@ na , where we built a mus@@ e@@ um around it ."
And that led to something which you probably do know .
"G@@ u@@ it@@ ar H@@ er@@ o came out of our la@@ b , and my two te@@ en@@ age d@@ augh@@ ters and most of the students at the M@@ I@@ T Me@@ di@@ a L@@ a@@ b are pro@@ of that if you make the right kind of inter@@ face , people are really interested in being in the mi@@ ddle of a piece of music , and playing it over and over and over again ."
"So , the model works , but it &apos;s only the ti@@ p of the i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g , because my second idea is that it &apos;s not enough just to want to make music in something like G@@ u@@ it@@ ar H@@ er@@ o ."
"And music is very fun , but it &apos;s also trans@@ form@@ ative ."
"It &apos;s very , very important ."
"M@@ usi@@ c can change your life , more than almost anything ."
"It can change the way you communi@@ cate with others , it can change your body , it can change your mind . So , we &apos;re trying to go to the next ste@@ p of how you build on top of something like G@@ u@@ it@@ ar H@@ er@@ o ."
"We are very inv@@ olved in education . We have a lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m project called T@@ o@@ y Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony , where we make all kinds of instru@@ ments that are also ad@@ di@@ ctive , but for little kids , so the kids will f@@ all in love with making music , want to spend their time doing it , and then will de@@ m@@ and to know how it works , how to make more , how to create . So , we make squ@@ e@@ e@@ zy instru@@ ments , like these Music S@@ ha@@ per@@ s that meas@@ ure the electri@@ city in your fin@@ g@@ ers , Be@@ at@@ bu@@ gs that let you ta@@ p in r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms — they ga@@ ther your r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , and like ho@@ t po@@ ta@@ to , you sen@@ d your r@@ hy@@ th@@ m to your friends ,"
"@@ who then have to imi@@ t@@ ate or re@@ spo@@ nd to what your doing — and a so@@ f@@ tw@@ are pac@@ k@@ age called H@@ y@@ per@@ sc@@ ore , which le@@ ts any@@ body use lin@@ es and color to make quite s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated music . E@@ x@@ tre@@ me@@ ly e@@ asy to use , but once you use it , you can go quite de@@ ep — music in any sty@@ le . And then , by pres@@ sing a bu@@ t@@ ton , it turns into music not@@ ation so that live musi@@ ci@@ ans can play your pie@@ ces ."
"We &apos;ve had good enough , really , very powerful effe@@ cts with kids around the world , and now people of all ages , using H@@ y@@ per@@ sc@@ ore ."
"So , we &apos;ve got@@ ten more and more interested in using these kinds of cre@@ ative acti@@ vi@@ ties in a much bro@@ a@@ der con@@ te@@ xt , for all kinds of people who don &apos;t usu@@ ally have the opportunity to make music ."
"So , one of the grow@@ ing fie@@ l@@ ds that we &apos;re working on at the Me@@ di@@ a L@@ a@@ b right now is music , mind and health ."
A lot of you have probably seen O@@ li@@ ver S@@ ac@@ ks &apos; wonderful new book called &quot; &quot; Musi@@ cop@@ hi@@ li@@ a &quot; &quot; . It &apos;s on s@@ ale in the bo@@ ok@@ stor@@ e . It &apos;s a great book .
"If you ha@@ ven &apos;t seen it , it &apos;s wor@@ th re@@ ading . He &apos;s a pi@@ ani@@ st hi@@ m@@ self , and he de@@ ta@@ il@@ s his whole car@@ e@@ er of looking at and obser@@ ving incredi@@ bly powerful effe@@ cts that music has had on pe@@ op@@ les &apos; lives in un@@ usu@@ al situ@@ ations ."
"So we know , for in@@ stance , that music is almost always the last thing that people with adv@@ an@@ ced Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s can still re@@ spo@@ nd to ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe many of you have noti@@ ced this with lo@@ ved ones , you can find somebody who can &apos;t re@@ cogni@@ ze their face in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , or can &apos;t tell any@@ one in their family , but you can still find a sh@@ ard of music that that person will j@@ um@@ p out of the cha@@ ir and start sing@@ ing . And with that you can bring back par@@ ts of people &apos;s memor@@ ies and per@@ son@@ ali@@ ties ."
"M@@ usi@@ c is the best way to re@@ stor@@ e spe@@ e@@ ch to people who have lost it through stro@@ k@@ es , movement to people with Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ ase ."
"It &apos;s very powerful for de@@ pres@@ sion , s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ enia , many , many things ."
"So , we &apos;re working on under@@ standing those under@@ l@@ ying prin@@ ci@@ ples and then building acti@@ vi@@ ties which will let music really impro@@ ve people &apos;s health ."
And we do this in many ways . We work with many different ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s .
"One of them is right ne@@ ar B@@ ost@@ on , called T@@ ew@@ k@@ s@@ bu@@ ry H@@ o@@ spit@@ al ."
"It &apos;s a lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m state ho@@ spit@@ al , where se@@ ver@@ al years ago we started working with H@@ y@@ per@@ sc@@ ore and patients with physi@@ cal and ment@@ al dis@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies ."
"This has become a cent@@ ral part of the tre@@ at@@ ment at T@@ ew@@ k@@ s@@ bu@@ ry ho@@ spit@@ al , so everybody there cl@@ am@@ ors to work on musi@@ cal acti@@ vi@@ ties ."
It &apos;s the acti@@ vity that seem@@ s to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate people &apos;s tre@@ at@@ ment the most and it also br@@ ings the entire ho@@ spit@@ al together as a kind of musi@@ cal community .
I wanted to show you a qui@@ ck video of some of this work before I go on .
V@@ ide@@ o : They &apos;re m@@ ani@@ pu@@ lat@@ ing each other &apos;s r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms .
"It &apos;s a real experience , not only to learn how to play and list@@ en to r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , but to tra@@ in your musi@@ cal memor@@ y and playing music in a group ."
"To get their h@@ ands on music , to sha@@ pe it themselves , change it , to experim@@ ent with it , to make their own music ."
So H@@ y@@ per@@ sc@@ ore le@@ ts you start from sc@@ rat@@ ch very quickly .
"E@@ very@@ body can experience music in a pro@@ found way , we just have to make different to@@ ols ."
"The third idea I want to share with you is that music , par@@ ad@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ cally , I think even more than words , is one of the very best ways we have of show@@ ing who we really are . I love gi@@ ving tal@@ ks , al@@ though str@@ ang@@ ely I feel more ner@@ v@@ ous gi@@ ving tal@@ ks than playing music ."
"If I were here playing cel@@ l@@ o , or playing on a syn@@ th , or sh@@ aring my music with you , I &apos;d be able to show things about myself that I can &apos;t tell you in words , more per@@ s@@ onal things , per@@ haps de@@ e@@ per things ."
"I think that &apos;s true for many of us , and I want to give you two exam@@ ples of how music is one of the most powerful inter@@ fac@@ es we have , from ourselves to the outside world ."
"The first is a really c@@ razy project that we &apos;re building right now , called De@@ ath and the Pow@@ ers . And it &apos;s a big op@@ era , one of the lar@@ ger op@@ era proje@@ cts going on in the world right now ."
"And it &apos;s about a man , ri@@ ch , suc@@ cess@@ ful , powerful , who wan@@ ts to live fore@@ ver ."
"So , he figu@@ res out a way to dow@@ n@@ lo@@ ad hi@@ m@@ self into his environment , actually into a ser@@ ies of boo@@ ks ."
"So this guy wan@@ ts to live fore@@ ver , he dow@@ n@@ lo@@ ads hi@@ m@@ self into his environment ."
The ma@@ in sing@@ er disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars at the beginning of the op@@ era and the entire st@@ age be@@ comes the ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ter . It be@@ comes his leg@@ acy .
"And the op@@ era is about what we can share , what we can pas@@ s on to others , to the people we love , and what we can &apos;t ."
"E@@ very obje@@ ct in the op@@ era comes ali@@ ve and is a gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic music instru@@ ment , like this ch@@ an@@ de@@ lie@@ r . It takes up the whole st@@ age . It looks like a ch@@ an@@ de@@ lie@@ r , but it &apos;s actually a rob@@ oti@@ c music instru@@ ment ."
"So , as you can see in this pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pe , gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic pi@@ ano str@@ ings , each str@@ ing is contro@@ l@@ led with a little rob@@ oti@@ c ele@@ ment — either little bow@@ s that stro@@ ke the str@@ ings , pro@@ pe@@ ll@@ ers that ti@@ ck@@ le the str@@ ings , ac@@ ou@@ stic sig@@ n@@ als that vi@@ br@@ ate the str@@ ings . We also have an ar@@ my of rob@@ ots on st@@ age ."
"These rob@@ ots are the kind of the inter@@ medi@@ ary between the ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ter , S@@ im@@ on Pow@@ ers , and his family . There are a whole ser@@ ies of them , kind of like a Gre@@ ek ch@@ or@@ us ."
They obser@@ ve the action . We &apos;ve desig@@ ned these squ@@ are rob@@ ots that we &apos;re test@@ ing right now at M@@ I@@ T called O@@ per@@ a@@ B@@ ots . These O@@ per@@ a@@ B@@ ots fol@@ low my music .
"They fol@@ low the char@@ ac@@ ters . They &apos;re s@@ mar@@ t enough , we hope , not to bu@@ m@@ p into each other . They go off on their own ."
"And then they can also , when you s@@ na@@ p , line up exactly the way you &apos;d like to ."
"E@@ ven though they &apos;re cu@@ be@@ s , they actually have a lot of per@@ son@@ ality ."
The largest set piece in the op@@ era is called The S@@ yst@@ em . It &apos;s a ser@@ ies of boo@@ ks .
"E@@ very single book is rob@@ oti@@ c , so they all move , they all make sound , and when you put them all together , they turn into these wal@@ ls , which have the g@@ est@@ ure and the per@@ son@@ ality of S@@ im@@ on Pow@@ ers . So he &apos;s disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ared , but the whole physi@@ cal environment be@@ comes this person ."
This is how he &apos;s cho@@ s@@ en to re@@ present hi@@ m@@ self .
The boo@@ ks also have high-@@ pac@@ ked L@@ E@@ D@@ s on the sp@@ ines . So it &apos;s all disp@@ l@@ ay .
And here &apos;s the great bar@@ it@@ one J@@ am@@ es M@@ ad@@ dal@@ en@@ a as he en@@ ters The S@@ yst@@ em .
This is a s@@ ne@@ ak pre@@ view .
"This pre@@ mie@@ res in M@@ on@@ ac@@ o — it &apos;s in Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 200@@ 9 . If by any ch@@ ance you can &apos;t make it , another idea with this project — here &apos;s this guy building his leg@@ acy through this very un@@ usu@@ al form , through music and through the environment ."
"But we &apos;re also making this available both on@@ line and in public sp@@ ac@@ es , as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own leg@@ acy or to make a leg@@ acy of someone we love ."
"So instead of being gr@@ and op@@ era , this op@@ era will turn into what we &apos;re thinking of as per@@ s@@ onal op@@ era ."
"And , if you &apos;re going to make a per@@ s@@ onal op@@ era , what about a per@@ s@@ onal instru@@ ment ?"
"E@@ very@@ thing I &apos;ve sh@@ own you so far — whether it &apos;s a hy@@ per@@ -@@ cel@@ l@@ o for Y@@ o@@ -@@ Y@@ o M@@ a or squ@@ e@@ e@@ zy to@@ y for a child — the instru@@ ments sta@@ yed the same and are val@@ u@@ able for a certain clas@@ s of person : a vi@@ r@@ tu@@ o@@ so , a child ."
"But what if I could make an instru@@ ment that could be ad@@ ap@@ ted to the way I per@@ son@@ ally be@@ have , to the way my h@@ ands work , to what I do very sk@@ il@@ l@@ fully , per@@ haps , to what I don &apos;t do so sk@@ il@@ l@@ fully ?"
"I think that this is the future of inter@@ face , it &apos;s the future of music , the future of instru@@ ments ."
"And I &apos;d like now to in@@ vi@@ te two very spe@@ cial people on the st@@ age , so that I can give you an example of what per@@ s@@ onal instru@@ ments might be like ."
"So , can you give a hand to A@@ d@@ am B@@ ou@@ lang@@ er , P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . stud@@ ent from the M@@ I@@ T Me@@ di@@ a L@@ a@@ b , and D@@ an E@@ ll@@ se@@ y . D@@ an , th@@ an@@ ks to TED and to B@@ om@@ bar@@ d@@ ier F@@ le@@ x@@ je@@ t , D@@ an is here with us today all the way from T@@ ew@@ k@@ s@@ bu@@ ry . He &apos;s a resi@@ dent at T@@ ew@@ k@@ s@@ bu@@ ry H@@ o@@ spit@@ al ."
"This is by far the far@@ th@@ est he &apos;s stra@@ yed from T@@ ew@@ k@@ s@@ bu@@ ry H@@ o@@ spit@@ al , I can tell you that , because he &apos;s moti@@ v@@ ated to me@@ et with you today and show you his own music ."
"So , first of all , D@@ an , do you want to say h@@ i to everyone and tell everyone who you are ?"
D@@ an E@@ ll@@ se@@ y : H@@ el@@ l@@ o . My name is D@@ an E@@ ll@@ se@@ y . I am 3@@ 4 years old and I have cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l pal@@ sy .
I have always lo@@ ved music and I am exci@@ ted to be able to con@@ du@@ ct my own music with this new so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
"T@@ od M@@ ach@@ over : And we &apos;re really exci@@ ted to have you here , really D@@ an . ( Applause ) So we met D@@ an about three years ago , three and a half years ago , when we started working at T@@ ew@@ k@@ s@@ bu@@ ry . E@@ very@@ body we met there was fanta@@ stic , did fanta@@ stic music . D@@ an had never made music before , and it turned out he was really fanta@@ stic at it . He &apos;s a born com@@ pos@@ er ."
"He &apos;s very sh@@ y , too ."
"So , turned out he &apos;s a fanta@@ stic com@@ pos@@ er , and over the last few years has been a con@@ st@@ ant col@@ labor@@ ator of ours . He has made many , many pie@@ ces ."
"He makes his own C@@ D@@ s . A@@ c@@ tually , he is quite well known in the B@@ ost@@ on area — ment@@ ors people at the ho@@ spit@@ al and children , lo@@ cally , in how to make their own music ."
"And I &apos;ll let A@@ d@@ am tell you . So , A@@ d@@ am is a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . stud@@ ent at M@@ I@@ T , an exper@@ t in music technology and medi@@ cine . And A@@ d@@ am and D@@ an have become close col@@ labor@@ at@@ ors ."
"What A@@ d@@ am &apos;s been working on for this last per@@ i@@ od is not only how to have D@@ an be able e@@ a@@ si@@ ly to make his own pie@@ ces , but how he can per@@ form his piece using this kind of per@@ s@@ onal instru@@ ment ."
"So , you want to say a little bit about how you guys work ?"
"A@@ d@@ am B@@ ou@@ lang@@ er : Yes . So , T@@ od and I en@@ ter@@ ed into a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion fol@@ low@@ ing the T@@ ew@@ k@@ s@@ bu@@ ry work and it was really about how D@@ an is an ex@@ pres@@ sive person , and he &apos;s an inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent and cre@@ ative person . And it &apos;s in his face , it &apos;s in his bre@@ a@@ thing , it &apos;s in his eyes . How come he can &apos;t per@@ form one of his pie@@ ces of music ? That &apos;s our respon@@ si@@ bility , and it doesn &apos;t make sense ."
"So we started develo@@ ping a technology that will al@@ low him with nu@@ ance , with pre@@ ci@@ sion , with control , and des@@ pi@@ te his physi@@ cal dis@@ ability , to be able to do that , to be able to per@@ form his piece of music ."
"So , the process and the technology — basically , first we needed an engine@@ ering solution . So , you know , we have a F@@ i@@ re@@ Wi@@ re cam@@ era , it looked at an in@@ fr@@ ared poin@@ ter ."
We went with the ty@@ pe of g@@ est@@ ure me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or that D@@ an was already used to with his spe@@ aking contro@@ l@@ ler .
"And this was actually the least interesting part of the work , you know , the design process . We needed an in@@ put ; we needed contin@@ u@@ ous trac@@ king ; in the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are , we look at the typ@@ es of sha@@ p@@ es he &apos;s making ."
"But , then was the really interesting aspe@@ ct of the work , fol@@ low@@ ing the engine@@ ering part , where , basically , we &apos;re c@@ od@@ ing over D@@ an &apos;s sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der at the ho@@ spit@@ al ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vely to figure out , you know , how does D@@ an move ?"
What &apos;s us@@ e@@ ful to him as an ex@@ pres@@ sive moti@@ on ?
"You know , what &apos;s his me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or for perform@@ ance ?"
What typ@@ es of things does he find important to control and con@@ v@@ ey in a piece of music ?
"So all the par@@ am@@ e@@ ter fi@@ tting , and really the technology was stre@@ t@@ ched at that point to f@@ it just D@@ an ."
"And , you know , I think this is a perspe@@ ctive shi@@ ft . It &apos;s not that our technolog@@ ies — they provi@@ de ac@@ cess , they al@@ low us to create pie@@ ces of cre@@ ative work ."
"But what about ex@@ pres@@ sion ? What about that moment when an arti@@ st deli@@ ver@@ s that piece of work ? You know , do our technolog@@ ies al@@ low us to ex@@ pre@@ ss ?"
"D@@ o they provi@@ de structure for us to do that ? And , you know , that &apos;s a per@@ s@@ onal relation@@ ship to ex@@ pres@@ sion that is l@@ ac@@ king in the technologi@@ cal sp@@ here . So , you know , with D@@ an , we needed a new design process , a new engine@@ ering process to sort of disco@@ ver his movement and his pat@@ h to ex@@ pres@@ sion that al@@ low him to per@@ form ."
And so that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do today .
T@@ M : So let &apos;s do it . So D@@ an do you want to tell everyone about what you &apos;re going to play now ?
"D@@ E : This is &quot; &quot; My E@@ ag@@ le S@@ ong . &quot; &quot; T@@ M : So D@@ an is going to play a piece of his , called &quot; &quot; My E@@ ag@@ le S@@ ong &quot; &quot; ."
"In fact , this is the sc@@ ore for D@@ an &apos;s piece , completely com@@ posed by D@@ an in H@@ y@@ per@@ sc@@ ore ."
So he can use his in@@ fr@@ ared trac@@ k@@ er to go dire@@ ct@@ ly into H@@ y@@ per@@ sc@@ ore .
"He &apos;s incredi@@ bly f@@ ast at it , too , f@@ ast@@ er than I am , in fact ."
"( Laughter ) T@@ M : He &apos;s really mo@@ d@@ est , too ."
So he can go in H@@ y@@ per@@ sc@@ ore . You start out by making me@@ lo@@ d@@ ies and r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms .
He can place those exactly where he wan@@ ts .
"E@@ ach one gets a color . He goes back into the com@@ posi@@ tion win@@ do@@ w , d@@ raw@@ s the lin@@ es , places everything the way he wan@@ ts to . L@@ o@@ o@@ king at the H@@ y@@ per@@ sc@@ ore , you can see it also , you can see where the se@@ ctions are , something might contin@@ ue for a while , change , get really c@@ razy and then end up with a big ban@@ g at the end ."
"So that &apos;s the way he made his piece , and as A@@ d@@ am says , we then figu@@ red out the best way to have him per@@ form his piece ."
"It &apos;s going to be looked at by this cam@@ era , an@@ al@@ y@@ ze his mov@@ em@@ ents , it &apos;s going to let D@@ an bring out all the different aspe@@ cts of his music that he wan@@ ts to ."
And you &apos;re also going to noti@@ ce a vi@@ su@@ al on the scre@@ en .
We asked one of our students to look at what the cam@@ era is meas@@ ur@@ ing .
"But instead of making it very liter@@ al , show@@ ing you exactly the cam@@ era trac@@ ing , we turned it into a gra@@ phi@@ c that shows you the basi@@ c movement , and shows the way it &apos;s being an@@ al@@ y@@ zed ."
"I think it gi@@ ves an under@@ standing of how we &apos;re pi@@ c@@ king out movement from what D@@ an &apos;s doing , but I think it will also show you , if you look at that movement , that when D@@ an makes music , his moti@@ ons are very pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful , very pre@@ ci@@ se , very dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ined and they &apos;re also very beautiful ."
"So , in hear@@ ing this piece , as I men@@ tion@@ ed before , the most important thing is the music &apos;s great , and it &apos;ll show you who D@@ an is ."
"So , are we ready A@@ d@@ am ?"
A@@ B : Yeah .
"T@@ M : OK , now D@@ an will play his piece &quot; &quot; My E@@ ag@@ le S@@ ong &quot; &quot; for you ."
( Applause ) T@@ M : Bra@@ v@@ o . ( Applause )
There &apos;s this con@@ st@@ ant c@@ ac@@ op@@ h@@ ony of no@@ ise .
S@@ ome things actually do sti@@ ck out .
"For example , this here is a big bir@@ d , a r@@ h@@ in@@ o@@ cer@@ os hor@@ n@@ bi@@ ll ."
This bu@@ z@@ z@@ ing is a ci@@ c@@ ada .
This is a family of gi@@ b@@ b@@ ons .
It &apos;s actually sing@@ ing to each other over a great di@@ stance .
"So , as I said , this was a gi@@ b@@ b@@ on re@@ ser@@ ve ."
"They spend most of their time re@@ ha@@ bi@@ lit@@ ating gi@@ b@@ b@@ ons , but they also have to spend a lot of their time prote@@ cting their area from il@@ leg@@ al lo@@ gg@@ ing that takes place on the side ."
"They ha@@ dn &apos;t been able to hear the cha@@ in@@ sa@@ ws , because as you heard , the fore@@ st is very , very l@@ ou@@ d ."
"It stru@@ ck me as quite un@@ ac@@ cep@@ table that in this moder@@ n time , just a few hundre@@ d me@@ ters away from a r@@ ang@@ er st@@ ation in a s@@ an@@ ctu@@ ary , that in fact no@@ body could hear it when someone who has a cha@@ in@@ saw gets fi@@ red up ."
"It sounds im@@ possible , but in fact , it was quite true ."
So how do we stop il@@ leg@@ al lo@@ gg@@ ing ?
"It &apos;s really tem@@ p@@ ting , as an engine@@ er , always to come up with a high-@@ te@@ ch , super@@ -@@ c@@ razy high-@@ te@@ ch solution , but in fact , you &apos;re in the ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st ."
"It has to be simple , it has to be sc@@ al@@ able , and so what we also noti@@ ced while were there was that everything we needed was already there ."
We could build a system that would al@@ low us to stop this using what &apos;s already there .
Wh@@ o was there ? What was already in the fore@@ st ?
"Well , we had people ."
"We had this group there that was de@@ di@@ c@@ ated , three fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time gu@@ ar@@ ds , that was de@@ di@@ c@@ ated to go and stop it , but they just needed to know what was happening out in the fore@@ st ."
"The real sur@@ pri@@ se , this is the big one , was that there was conne@@ cti@@ vity out in the fore@@ st ."
There was cell phone ser@@ vice way out in the mi@@ ddle of now@@ here .
But you have to have a de@@ vice to go up in the tre@@ es .
"So if we can use some de@@ vice to list@@ en to the sounds of the fore@@ st , conne@@ ct to the cell phone network that &apos;s there , and sen@@ d an al@@ er@@ t to people on the ground , per@@ haps we could have a solution to this issue for them ."
"But let &apos;s take a moment to talk about sa@@ ving the ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st , because it &apos;s something that we &apos;ve defini@@ tely all heard about fore@@ ver ."
"P@@ e@@ ople in my gener@@ ation have heard about sa@@ ving the ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st since we were kids , and it seem@@ s that the mess@@ age has never changed : We &apos;ve got to sa@@ ve the ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st , it &apos;s su@@ per ur@@ g@@ ent , this many fo@@ ot@@ ball fie@@ l@@ ds have been de@@ stro@@ yed y@@ est@@ er@@ day ."
"But in fact , this is the lit@@ t@@ le@@ -@@ known fact that I didn &apos;t realize at the time : De@@ fore@@ st@@ ation ac@@ coun@@ ts for more gre@@ en@@ house gas than all of the world &apos;s plan@@ es , tra@@ ins , cars , tru@@ cks and ships com@@ b@@ ined ."
It &apos;s the second high@@ est con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tor to clim@@ ate change .
"So if we can help people in the fore@@ st en@@ force the ru@@ les that are there , then in fact we could e@@ at he@@ avi@@ ly into this 1@@ 7 percent and poten@@ ti@@ ally have a major impac@@ t in the shor@@ t ter@@ m ."
"It might just be the che@@ ap@@ est , f@@ ast@@ est way to fi@@ ght clim@@ ate change ."
And so here &apos;s the system that we imagine .
It &apos;s no more about going out and fin@@ ding a t@@ ree that &apos;s been cut .
"C@@ ell ph@@ ones are th@@ row@@ n away by the hundre@@ ds of mi@@ llions every year , hundre@@ ds of mi@@ llions in the U.@@ S. alone , not coun@@ ting the rest of the world , which of course we should do , but in fact , cell ph@@ ones are great ."
They &apos;re full of sen@@ sor@@ s .
They can list@@ en to the sounds of the fore@@ st .
These are stri@@ ps that are cut down .
Th@@ an@@ ks very much to them for allow@@ ing me to do that .
"As you can see , this is a de@@ vice up in a t@@ ree ."
"What you can see from here , per@@ haps , is that they are pretty well ob@@ s@@ cu@@ red up in the t@@ ree can@@ op@@ y at a di@@ stance ."
So does it actually work ?
"Well , to test it , we took it back to In@@ d@@ one@@ si@@ a , not the same place , but another place , to another gi@@ b@@ b@@ on re@@ ser@@ ve that was thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed da@@ i@@ ly by il@@ leg@@ al lo@@ gg@@ ing ."
We were able to get a re@@ al@@ -@@ time al@@ er@@ t .
I got an e@@ ma@@ il on my phone .
"A@@ ll these guys are smo@@ king ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes , and then I get an e@@ ma@@ il , and they all qu@@ ie@@ t down , and in fact you can hear the cha@@ in@@ saw really , really fa@@ int in the back@@ ground , but no one had noti@@ ced it until that moment ."
And so then we took off to actually stop these lo@@ gg@@ ers .
I was pretty ner@@ v@@ ous .
This is the moment where we &apos;ve actually ar@@ ri@@ ved close to where the lo@@ gg@@ ers are .
This is the moment where you can see where I &apos;m actually re@@ gre@@ tting per@@ haps the entire en@@ de@@ av@@ or .
I &apos;m not really sure what &apos;s on the other side of this hi@@ ll .
That guy &apos;s much bra@@ ver than I am .
"But he went , so I had to go , wal@@ king up , and in fact , he made it over the hi@@ ll , and inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted the lo@@ gg@@ ers in the act ."
"For them , it was such a sur@@ pri@@ se — they had never , ever been inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted before — that it was such an im@@ pres@@ sive ev@@ ent for them , that we &apos;ve heard from our part@@ n@@ ers they have not been back since ."
"They show@@ ed us how the entire oper@@ ation works , and what they really con@@ v@@ in@@ ced us on the spo@@ t was that if you can show up in real time and stop people , it &apos;s enough of a de@@ ter@@ r@@ ent they won &apos;t come back ."
"So — Thank you . ( Applause ) Wor@@ d of this sp@@ read , possi@@ bly because we told a lot of people , and in fact , then some really amazing stuff started to happen ."
"P@@ e@@ ople from around the world started to sen@@ d us e@@ ma@@ il@@ s , phone cal@@ ls ."
"And then something really amazing happened , which was that people started sen@@ ding us their own old cell ph@@ ones ."
"And if the rest of the de@@ vice can be completely re@@ cy@@ c@@ led , then we believe it &apos;s an enti@@ re@@ ly up@@ cy@@ c@@ led de@@ vice ."
"So again , this didn &apos;t come because of any sort of high-@@ te@@ ch solution ."
Thank you very much .
"As an arti@@ st , conne@@ ction is very important to me ."
Th@@ rou@@ gh my work I &apos;m trying to arti@@ cul@@ ate that hum@@ ans are not se@@ par@@ ate from nature and that everything is inter@@ conne@@ cted .
"I first went to An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca almost 10 years ago , where I saw my first i@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs ."
I was in a@@ we .
"My heart be@@ at f@@ ast , my head was di@@ z@@ zy , trying to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end what it was that sto@@ od in front of me ."
"The i@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs around me were almost 2@@ 00 fe@@ et out of the water , and I could only help but won@@ der that this was one s@@ now@@ fl@@ ake on top of another s@@ now@@ fl@@ ake , year after year ."
I@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs are born when they cal@@ ve off of gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ s or bre@@ ak off of ice sh@@ el@@ ves .
E@@ ach i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g has its own individu@@ al per@@ son@@ ality .
They have a di@@ st@@ in@@ ct way of inter@@ ac@@ ting with their environment and their exper@@ ien@@ ces .
"S@@ ome ref@@ use to give up and h@@ old on to the bi@@ t@@ ter end , while others can &apos;t take it any@@ more and c@@ ru@@ m@@ ble in a f@@ it of dra@@ m@@ atic pas@@ sion ."
"It &apos;s e@@ asy to think , when you look at an i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g , that they &apos;re is@@ ol@@ ated , that they &apos;re se@@ par@@ ate and alone , much like we as hum@@ ans sometimes view ourselves ."
But the re@@ ality is far from it .
"As an i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g me@@ l@@ ts , I am bre@@ a@@ thing in its an@@ cient atmo@@ sp@@ here ."
"As the i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g me@@ l@@ ts , it is rele@@ as@@ ing min@@ er@@ al@@ -@@ ri@@ ch fre@@ sh water that n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ es many form@@ s of life ."
"I appro@@ ach photograph@@ ing these i@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs as if I &apos;m making por@@ tra@@ its of my an@@ c@@ est@@ ors , know@@ ing that in these individu@@ al mom@@ ents they exi@@ st in that way and will never exi@@ st that way again ."
"It is not a death when they me@@ l@@ t ; it is not an end , but a contin@@ u@@ ation of their pat@@ h through the cy@@ cle of life ."
S@@ ome of the ice in the i@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs that I photogra@@ ph is very young — a couple thous@@ and years old .
"And some of the ice is over 10@@ 0,000 years old ."
"The last pi@@ ctures I &apos;d like to show you are of an i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g that I photograph@@ ed in Q@@ e@@ q@@ et@@ ar@@ su@@ a@@ q , Gre@@ en@@ land ."
It &apos;s a very r@@ are oc@@ ca@@ sion that you get to actually wit@@ ness an i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g rol@@ ling .
So here it is .
You can see on the left side a small boat .
That &apos;s about a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ fo@@ ot boat .
And I &apos;d like you to pay at@@ ten@@ tion to the sha@@ pe of the i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g and where it is at the wat@@ er@@ line .
"You can see here , it begin@@ s to ro@@ ll , and the boat has mo@@ ved to the other side , and the man is standing there ."
This is an a@@ ver@@ ag@@ e-@@ size Gre@@ en@@ lan@@ di@@ c i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g .
"It &apos;s about 1@@ 20 fe@@ et ab@@ o@@ ve the water , or 40 me@@ ters ."
And this video is real time .
"( Music ) And just like that , the i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g shows you a different side of its per@@ son@@ ality ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
The au@@ di@@ t@@ ori@@ um was em@@ p@@ ty .
"It was li@@ t only by the di@@ m , green g@@ low of the em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy ex@@ it sig@@ n ."
This was the most exci@@ ting day of V@@ era &apos;s life .
"S@@ he was the youn@@ gest con@@ cer@@ t pro@@ mot@@ er in G@@ er@@ many , and she had per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed the Co@@ log@@ ne O@@ per@@ a H@@ ou@@ se to ho@@ st a lat@@ e-@@ night con@@ cer@@ t of j@@ az@@ z from the American musi@@ ci@@ an , K@@ ei@@ th J@@ ar@@ re@@ t@@ t ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 people were coming ."
"And in just a few hours , J@@ ar@@ re@@ t@@ t would walk out on the same st@@ age , he &apos;d si@@ t down at the pi@@ ano and without re@@ hear@@ s@@ al or sh@@ e@@ et music , he would beg@@ in to play ."
"But right now , V@@ era was in@@ tro@@ du@@ cing K@@ ei@@ th to the pi@@ ano in question , and it wasn &apos;t going well ."
"J@@ ar@@ re@@ t@@ t looked to the instru@@ ment a little war@@ i@@ ly , pla@@ yed a few not@@ es , wal@@ ked around it , pla@@ yed a few more not@@ es , mu@@ t@@ ter@@ ed something to his produ@@ cer ."
Th@@ en the produ@@ cer came over to V@@ era and said ...
"&quot; If you don &apos;t get a new pi@@ ano , K@@ ei@@ th can &apos;t play . &quot;"
There &apos;d been a mist@@ ake .
The op@@ era house had provi@@ ded the wrong instru@@ ment .
"The black not@@ es were sti@@ c@@ king , the white not@@ es were out of tu@@ ne , the pe@@ d@@ als didn &apos;t work and the pi@@ ano itself was just too small ."
It wouldn &apos;t create the v@@ olu@@ me that would fi@@ ll a large space such as the Co@@ log@@ ne O@@ per@@ a H@@ ou@@ se .
So K@@ ei@@ th J@@ ar@@ re@@ t@@ t left .
"He went and s@@ at outside in his car , lea@@ ving V@@ era B@@ ran@@ des to get on the phone to try to find a re@@ plac@@ ement pi@@ ano ."
"Now she got a pi@@ ano tu@@ ner , but she couldn &apos;t get a new pi@@ ano ."
"And so she went outside and she sto@@ od there in the ra@@ in , talking to K@@ ei@@ th J@@ ar@@ re@@ t@@ t , be@@ gg@@ ing him not to can@@ ce@@ l the con@@ cer@@ t ."
"And so a few hours later , J@@ ar@@ re@@ t@@ t did in@@ de@@ ed ste@@ p out on@@ to the st@@ age of the op@@ era house , he s@@ at down at the un@@ pla@@ y@@ able pi@@ ano and began ."
( Music ) Wi@@ th@@ in mom@@ ents it became clear that something mag@@ i@@ cal was happening .
"J@@ ar@@ re@@ t@@ t was av@@ o@@ i@@ ding those u@@ pp@@ er regi@@ st@@ ers , he was sti@@ c@@ king to the mi@@ ddle t@@ ones of the ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard , which gave the piece a so@@ o@@ thing , am@@ b@@ ien@@ t qu@@ ality ."
"But also , because the pi@@ ano was so qu@@ ie@@ t , he had to set up these ru@@ m@@ b@@ ling , re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive ri@@ f@@ f@@ s in the bas@@ s ."
"And he sto@@ od up t@@ wi@@ st@@ ing , po@@ un@@ ding down on the ke@@ ys , des@@ per@@ ately trying to create enough v@@ olu@@ me to re@@ ach the people in the back row ."
It &apos;s an electri@@ f@@ ying perform@@ ance .
And the audience lo@@ ved it .
K@@ ei@@ th J@@ ar@@ re@@ t@@ t had been h@@ an@@ ded a m@@ ess .
"He had em@@ brac@@ ed that m@@ ess , and it so@@ ared ."
But let &apos;s think for a moment about J@@ ar@@ re@@ t@@ t &apos;s ini@@ tial in@@ st@@ in@@ ct .
He didn &apos;t want to play .
"O@@ f course , I think any of us , in any re@@ mot@@ ely si@@ mi@@ lar situ@@ ation , would feel the same way , we &apos;d have the same in@@ st@@ in@@ ct ."
We don &apos;t want to be asked to do good work with bad to@@ ols .
"But J@@ ar@@ re@@ t@@ t &apos;s in@@ st@@ in@@ ct was wrong , and th@@ ank go@@ od@@ ness he changed his mind ."
And I think our in@@ st@@ in@@ ct is also wrong .
I think we need to ga@@ in a bit more ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation for the u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted adv@@ an@@ t@@ ages of having to cop@@ e with a little m@@ ess .
"So let me give you some exam@@ ples from cogni@@ tive psycho@@ logy , from comple@@ x@@ ity science , from social psycho@@ logy , and of course , ro@@ ck &apos; n &apos; ro@@ ll ."
So cogni@@ tive psycho@@ logy first .
"We &apos;ve actually known for a while that certain kinds of difficul@@ ty , certain kinds of ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le , can actually impro@@ ve our perform@@ ance ."
"So the regu@@ lar hand@@ out would be for@@ mat@@ ted in something stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward , such as H@@ el@@ ve@@ ti@@ ca or T@@ im@@ es New R@@ om@@ an ."
"But half these clas@@ ses were getting hand@@ ou@@ ts that were for@@ mat@@ ted in something sort of inten@@ se , like Ha@@ et@@ ten@@ sch@@ we@@ i@@ ler , or something with a z@@ est@@ y b@@ oun@@ ce , like C@@ om@@ ic S@@ ans it@@ ali@@ ci@@ zed ."
"Now , these are really u@@ g@@ ly f@@ on@@ ts , and they &apos;re difficult f@@ on@@ ts to read ."
"And the reason is , the difficult f@@ on@@ t had s@@ low@@ ed them down , for@@ ced them to work a bit har@@ der , to think a bit more about what they were re@@ ading , to inter@@ pre@@ t it ..."
and so they learned more .
A@@ no@@ ther example .
The psycho@@ logi@@ st S@@ hel@@ ley C@@ ar@@ son has been test@@ ing H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard under@@ gra@@ du@@ ates for the qu@@ ality of their at@@ ten@@ ti@@ onal fil@@ ters .
What do I mean by that ?
"What I mean is , imagine you &apos;re in a re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant , you &apos;re having a convers@@ ation , there are all kinds of other convers@@ ations going on in the re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant , you want to fil@@ ter them out , you want to fo@@ cus on what &apos;s important to you ."
C@@ an you do that ?
"If you can , you have good , stron@@ g at@@ ten@@ ti@@ onal fil@@ ters ."
But some people really stru@@ gg@@ le with that .
S@@ ome of C@@ ar@@ son &apos;s under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate sub@@ je@@ cts stru@@ gg@@ led with that .
"They had we@@ ak fil@@ ters , they had po@@ rou@@ s fil@@ ters — let a lot of ex@@ ter@@ na@@ l information in ."
And so what that me@@ ant is they were con@@ stan@@ tly being inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted by the si@@ ghts and the sounds of the world around them .
"If there was a tele@@ vision on while they were doing their es@@ says , they couldn &apos;t scre@@ en it out ."
"Now , you would think that that was a dis@@ adv@@ an@@ t@@ age ..."
but no .
"When C@@ ar@@ son looked at what these students had ach@@ ie@@ ved , the ones with the we@@ ak fil@@ ters were v@@ ast@@ ly more li@@ ke@@ ly to have some real cre@@ ative mi@@ le@@ st@@ one in their lives , to have publi@@ shed their first no@@ vel , to have rele@@ as@@ ed their first al@@ bu@@ m ."
These di@@ strac@@ tions were actually g@@ ri@@ sts to their cre@@ ative mi@@ ll .
They were able to think outside the box because their box was full of ho@@ les .
Let &apos;s talk about comple@@ x@@ ity science .
So how do you sol@@ ve a really comple@@ x — the world &apos;s full of comp@@ lic@@ ated problems — how do you sol@@ ve a really comp@@ lic@@ ated problem ?
"For example , you try to make a je@@ t eng@@ ine ."
"There are lots and lots of different v@@ ari@@ ab@@ les , the oper@@ ating temper@@ ature , the materi@@ als , all the different di@@ men@@ sions , the sha@@ pe ."
"You can &apos;t sol@@ ve that kind of problem all in one go , it &apos;s too hard ."
So what do you do ?
"Well , one thing you can do is try to sol@@ ve it ste@@ p@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ ste@@ p ."
"So you have some kind of pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pe and you t@@ we@@ ak it , you test it , you impro@@ ve it ."
"You t@@ we@@ ak it , you test it , you impro@@ ve it ."
"Now , this idea of mar@@ gin@@ al ga@@ ins will ev@@ en@@ tually get you a good je@@ t eng@@ ine ."
And it &apos;s been quite wi@@ de@@ ly im@@ ple@@ men@@ ted in the world .
"So you &apos;ll hear about it , for example , in high perform@@ ance cy@@ c@@ ling , we@@ b desig@@ n@@ ers will talk about trying to op@@ ti@@ mi@@ ze their we@@ b p@@ ages , they &apos;re looking for these ste@@ p@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ ste@@ p ga@@ ins ."
That &apos;s a good way to sol@@ ve a comp@@ lic@@ ated problem .
But you know what would make it a better way ?
A d@@ as@@ h of m@@ ess .
"You ad@@ d ran@@ dom@@ ness , early on in the process , you make c@@ razy mo@@ ves , you try stu@@ pi@@ d things that sh@@ ouldn &apos;t work , and that will ten@@ d to make the proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ving work better ."
"And the reason for that is the t@@ rou@@ ble with the ste@@ p@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ ste@@ p process , the mar@@ gin@@ al ga@@ ins , is they can walk you gra@@ du@@ ally down a de@@ ad end ."
"And if you start with the ran@@ dom@@ ness , that be@@ comes less li@@ ke@@ ly , and your proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ving be@@ comes more rob@@ ust ."
Let &apos;s talk about social psycho@@ logy .
"So the psycho@@ logi@@ st K@@ a@@ ther@@ ine P@@ h@@ il@@ li@@ ps , with some colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es , re@@ cent@@ ly gave mu@@ r@@ der m@@ yst@@ ery problems to some students , and these students were colle@@ cted in grou@@ ps of four and they were given do@@ s@@ sie@@ r@@ s with information about a cri@@ me — ali@@ b@@ is and evi@@ dence , wit@@ ness stat@@ em@@ ents and three s@@ us@@ pe@@ cts ."
"And the grou@@ ps of four students were asked to figure out who did it , who com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted the cri@@ me ."
And there were two tre@@ at@@ ments in this experim@@ ent .
"In some c@@ ases these were four friends , they all knew each other well ."
And you can see where I &apos;m going with this .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously I &apos;m going to say that the grou@@ ps with the str@@ ang@@ er sol@@ ved the problem more effe@@ cti@@ vely , which is true , they did ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , they sol@@ ved the problem quite a lot more effe@@ cti@@ vely ."
"So the grou@@ ps of four friends , they only had a 5@@ 0-@@ 50 ch@@ ance of getting the answer right ."
"Wh@@ ich is actually not that great — in mul@@ ti@@ ple cho@@ ice , for three ans@@ w@@ ers ? 5@@ 0-@@ 50 &apos;s not good ."
"( Laughter ) The three friends and the str@@ ang@@ er , even though the str@@ ang@@ er didn &apos;t have any ex@@ tra information , even though it was just a case of how that changed the convers@@ ation to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ate that aw@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ ness , the three friends and the str@@ ang@@ er , they had a 7@@ 5 percent ch@@ ance of fin@@ ding the right answer ."
That &apos;s quite a big lea@@ p in perform@@ ance .
"But I think what &apos;s really interesting is not just that the three friends and the str@@ ang@@ er did a better job , but how they felt about it ."
"So when K@@ a@@ ther@@ ine P@@ h@@ il@@ li@@ ps inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ed the grou@@ ps of four friends , they had a nice time , they also thought they &apos;d done a good job ."
They were com@@ plac@@ ent .
"When she spo@@ ke to the three friends and the str@@ ang@@ er , they had not had a nice time — it &apos;s actually rather difficult , it &apos;s rather aw@@ k@@ ward ..."
and they were full of d@@ ou@@ b@@ t .
They didn &apos;t think they &apos;d done a good job even though they had .
And I think that really ex@@ em@@ pli@@ f@@ ies the challen@@ ge that we &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with here .
"Because , ye@@ ah — the u@@ g@@ ly f@@ on@@ t , the aw@@ k@@ ward str@@ ang@@ er , the ran@@ dom move ..."
"@@ these dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tions help us sol@@ ve problems , they help us become more cre@@ ative ."
But we don &apos;t feel that they &apos;re hel@@ ping us .
We feel that they &apos;re getting in the way ...
and so we resi@@ st .
And that &apos;s why the last example is really important .
So I want to talk about somebody from the back@@ ground of the world of ro@@ ck &apos; n &apos; ro@@ ll .
"And you may know him , he &apos;s actually a TE@@ D@@ -@@ ster ."
H@@ is name is Bri@@ an E@@ no .
He is an am@@ b@@ ien@@ t com@@ pos@@ er — rather bri@@ lli@@ ant .
He &apos;s also a kind of cat@@ al@@ y@@ st behind some of the great ro@@ ck &apos; n &apos; ro@@ ll al@@ bu@@ ms of the last 40 years .
"He &apos;s worked with Davi@@ d B@@ owie on &quot; &quot; H@@ er@@ o@@ es , &quot; &quot; he worked with U@@ 2 on &quot; &quot; A@@ ch@@ tu@@ n@@ g B@@ aby &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Jo@@ sh@@ u@@ a T@@ ree , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s worked with D@@ E@@ V@@ O , he &apos;s worked with Col@@ d@@ play , he &apos;s worked with everybody ."
And what does he do to make these great ro@@ ck b@@ ands better ?
"Well , he makes a m@@ ess ."
He dis@@ ru@@ p@@ ts their cre@@ ative pro@@ cess@@ es .
It &apos;s his ro@@ le to be the aw@@ k@@ ward str@@ ang@@ er .
It &apos;s his ro@@ le to tell them that they have to play the un@@ pla@@ y@@ able pi@@ ano .
"And one of the ways in which he cre@@ ates this dis@@ ru@@ ption is through this re@@ mark@@ able de@@ ck of car@@ ds — I have my sig@@ ned cop@@ y here — th@@ ank you , Bri@@ an ."
"They &apos;re called The O@@ bli@@ qu@@ e S@@ tr@@ ate@@ g@@ ies , he develo@@ ped them with a friend of his ."
"And when they &apos;re stu@@ ck in the studi@@ o , Bri@@ an E@@ no will re@@ ach for one of the car@@ ds ."
"He &apos;ll dra@@ w one at ran@@ dom , and he &apos;ll make the b@@ and fol@@ low the instru@@ ctions on the car@@ d ."
So this one ...
&quot; Ch@@ ange instru@@ ment ro@@ les . &quot;
"@@ Yeah , everyone s@@ wa@@ p instru@@ ments — D@@ ru@@ m@@ m@@ er on the pi@@ ano — Bri@@ lli@@ ant , bri@@ lli@@ ant idea ."
&quot; L@@ ook clo@@ se@@ ly at the most em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing de@@ ta@@ il@@ s . Am@@ pli@@ fy them . &quot;
"&quot; M@@ ake a sud@@ den , de@@ stru@@ ctive , un@@ pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able action . In@@ cor@@ por@@ ate . &quot;"
These car@@ ds are dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tive .
"Now , they &apos;ve pro@@ ved their wor@@ th in al@@ bu@@ m after al@@ bu@@ m ."
The musi@@ ci@@ ans h@@ ate them .
( Laughter ) So P@@ hi@@ l Col@@ lin@@ s was playing dru@@ ms on an early Bri@@ an E@@ no al@@ bu@@ m .
He got so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated he started th@@ row@@ ing be@@ er cans across the studi@@ o .
"C@@ ar@@ lo@@ s Al@@ om@@ ar , great ro@@ ck gu@@ it@@ ari@@ st , working with E@@ no on Davi@@ d B@@ owie &apos;s &quot; &quot; L@@ od@@ ger &quot; &quot; al@@ bu@@ m , and at one point he turns to Bri@@ an and says , &quot; Bri@@ an , this experim@@ ent is stu@@ pi@@ d . &quot;"
"But the thing is it was a pretty good al@@ bu@@ m , but also , C@@ ar@@ lo@@ s Al@@ om@@ ar , 3@@ 5 years later , now uses The O@@ bli@@ qu@@ e S@@ tr@@ ate@@ g@@ ies ."
And he tel@@ ls his students to use The O@@ bli@@ qu@@ e S@@ tr@@ ate@@ g@@ ies because he &apos;s realized something .
J@@ ust because you don &apos;t like it doesn &apos;t mean it isn &apos;t hel@@ ping you .
"The strate@@ g@@ ies actually wer@@ en &apos;t a de@@ ck of car@@ ds ori@@ gin@@ ally , they were just a li@@ st — li@@ st on the recor@@ ding studi@@ o w@@ all ."
A che@@ ck@@ li@@ st of things you might try if you got stu@@ ck .
The li@@ st didn &apos;t work .
K@@ now why ?
N@@ ot mess@@ y enough .
"@@ Y@@ our ey@@ e would go down the li@@ st and it would se@@ t@@ tle on whatever was the least dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tive , the least t@@ rou@@ bl@@ es@@ ome , which of course mis@@ ses the point enti@@ re@@ ly ."
"And what Bri@@ an E@@ no came to realize was , y@@ es , we need to run the stu@@ pi@@ d experim@@ ents , we need to deal with the aw@@ k@@ ward str@@ ang@@ ers , we need to try to read the u@@ g@@ ly f@@ on@@ ts ."
These things help us .
"They help us sol@@ ve problems , they help us be more cre@@ ative ."
But also ...
we really need some per@@ su@@ a@@ sion if we &apos;re going to ac@@ cept this .
So h@@ ow@@ ever we do it ...
"@@ whether it &apos;s sh@@ e@@ er wil@@ l@@ power , whether it &apos;s the fli@@ p of a car@@ d or whether it &apos;s a gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p from a G@@ er@@ man te@@ en@@ ag@@ er , all of us , from time to time , need to si@@ t down and try and play the un@@ pla@@ y@@ able pi@@ ano ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk about the simple tru@@ th in le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship in the 2@@ 1@@ st century .
"In the 2@@ 1@@ st century , we need to actually look at — and what I &apos;m actually going to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you to consi@@ der today — is to go back to our school days when we learned how to coun@@ t ."
But I think it &apos;s time for us to think about what we coun@@ t .
Because what we actually coun@@ t tru@@ ly coun@@ ts .
Let me start by tel@@ ling you a little story .
This is V@@ an Q@@ u@@ ach .
She came to this country in 19@@ 8@@ 6 from V@@ ie@@ t@@ nam .
She changed her name to V@@ i@@ vi@@ an because she wanted to f@@ it in here in America .
H@@ er first job was at an in@@ ner@@ -@@ city mot@@ el in S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co as a ma@@ id .
I happened to bu@@ y that mot@@ el about three months after V@@ i@@ vi@@ an started working there .
So V@@ i@@ vi@@ an and I have been working together for 2@@ 3 years .
"Wi@@ th the y@@ ou@@ th@@ ful ide@@ ali@@ sm of a 2@@ 6@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old , in 19@@ 8@@ 7 , I started my company and I called it Jo@@ ie de V@@ i@@ v@@ re , a very im@@ prac@@ tical name , because I actually was looking to create jo@@ y of life ."
"And this first hot@@ el that I b@@ ou@@ ght , mot@@ el , was a pa@@ y@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ hour , no@@ -@@ tell mot@@ el in the in@@ ner@@ -@@ city of S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co ."
"As I spent time with V@@ i@@ vi@@ an , I saw that she had sort of a jo@@ ie de vi@@ v@@ re in how she did her work ."
It made me question and cu@@ ri@@ ous : How could someone actually find jo@@ y in cle@@ an@@ ing to@@ i@@ le@@ ts for a living ?
"So I spent time with V@@ i@@ vi@@ an , and I saw that she didn &apos;t find jo@@ y in cle@@ an@@ ing to@@ i@@ le@@ ts ."
"H@@ er job , her go@@ al and her cal@@ ling was not to become the world &apos;s gre@@ at@@ est to@@ i@@ let sc@@ ru@@ b@@ ber ."
What coun@@ ts for V@@ i@@ vi@@ an was the emoti@@ onal conne@@ ction she created with her fel@@ low em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es and our gu@@ est@@ s .
And what gave her in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation and me@@ an@@ ing was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home .
Because V@@ i@@ vi@@ an knew what it was like to be far away from home .
"That very human l@@ es@@ son , more than 20 years ago , ser@@ ved me well during the last economic dow@@ n@@ turn we had ."
"In the wa@@ ke of the dot@@ co@@ m c@@ ra@@ sh and 9 / 11 , S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a hot@@ els went through the largest per@@ cent@@ age re@@ ven@@ ue dro@@ p in the history of American hot@@ els ."
"We were the largest oper@@ ator of hot@@ els in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a , so we were parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able ."
"But also back then , remember we stop@@ ped e@@ ating F@@ ren@@ ch fr@@ ies in this country ."
"Well , not exactly , of course not ."
"We started e@@ ating &quot; &quot; fre@@ e@@ dom fr@@ ies , &quot; &quot; and we started bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ ting anything that was F@@ ren@@ ch ."
"Well , my name of my company , Jo@@ ie de V@@ i@@ v@@ re — so I started getting these let@@ ters from places like Al@@ ab@@ ama and O@@ r@@ ange C@@ oun@@ ty saying to me that they were going to bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ t my company because they thought we were a F@@ ren@@ ch company ."
"And I &apos;d write them back , and I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; What a minu@@ te . We &apos;re not F@@ ren@@ ch ."
"We &apos;re an American company . We &apos;re based in S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d get a ter@@ se respon@@ se : &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s wor@@ se . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So one particular day when I was feeling a little de@@ pres@@ sed and not a lot of jo@@ ie de vi@@ v@@ re , I en@@ ded up in the local bo@@ ok@@ stor@@ e around the cor@@ ner from our offi@@ ces ."
And I ini@@ ti@@ ally en@@ ded up in the business se@@ ction of the bo@@ ok@@ stor@@ e looking for a business solution .
"But given my be@@ fu@@ dd@@ led state of mind , I en@@ ded up in the self-@@ help se@@ ction very quickly ."
"That &apos;s where I got re@@ ac@@ qu@@ a@@ in@@ ted with A@@ bra@@ ha@@ m M@@ as@@ low &apos;s &quot; &quot; h@@ ier@@ ar@@ chy of needs . &quot; &quot; I took one psycho@@ logy clas@@ s in colle@@ ge , and I learned about this guy , A@@ bra@@ ha@@ m M@@ as@@ low , as many of us are fami@@ li@@ ar with his h@@ ier@@ ar@@ chy of needs ."
"But as I s@@ at there for four hours , the full af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , re@@ ading M@@ as@@ low , I re@@ cogni@@ zed something that is true of most le@@ ad@@ ers ."
"One of the sim@@ pl@@ est fac@@ ts in business is something that we often neg@@ le@@ ct , and that is that we &apos;re all human ."
"E@@ ach of us , no matter what our ro@@ le is in business , has some h@@ ier@@ ar@@ chy of needs in the wor@@ k@@ place ."
"So as I started re@@ ading more M@@ as@@ low , what I started to realize is that M@@ as@@ low , later in his life , wanted to take this h@@ ier@@ ar@@ chy for the individu@@ al and app@@ ly it to the colle@@ ctive , to organiz@@ ations and speci@@ fi@@ cally to business ."
"But un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , he d@@ ied pre@@ mat@@ u@@ re@@ ly in 19@@ 70 , and so he wasn &apos;t really able to live that dre@@ am completely ."
So I realized in that dot@@ co@@ m c@@ ra@@ sh that my ro@@ le in life was to ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l A@@ be M@@ as@@ low .
"And that &apos;s what I did a few years ago when I took that fi@@ ve@@ -@@ level h@@ ier@@ ar@@ chy of needs py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d and turned it into what I call the trans@@ form@@ ation py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d , which is survi@@ v@@ al , suc@@ cess and trans@@ form@@ ation ."
"It &apos;s not just fundam@@ ent@@ al in business , it &apos;s fundam@@ ent@@ al in life ."
"And we started as@@ king ourselves the questions about how we were actually ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sing the high@@ er needs , these trans@@ form@@ ational needs for our key em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es in the company ."
These three le@@ v@@ els of the h@@ ier@@ ar@@ chy needs rel@@ ate to the five le@@ v@@ els of M@@ as@@ low &apos;s h@@ ier@@ ar@@ chy of needs .
"But as we started as@@ king ourselves about how we were ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sing the high@@ er needs of our em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es and our cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers , I realized we had no me@@ tri@@ cs ."
We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right .
"So we started as@@ king ourselves : What kind of less obvi@@ ous me@@ tri@@ cs could we use to actually ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate our em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es &apos; sense of me@@ an@@ ing , or our cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers &apos; sense of emoti@@ onal conne@@ ction with us ?"
"For example , we actually started as@@ king our em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es , do they understand the mis@@ sion of our company , and do they feel like they believe in it , can they actually in@@ flu@@ ence it , and do they feel that their work actually has an impac@@ t on it ?"
"We started as@@ king our cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers , did they feel an emoti@@ onal conne@@ ction with us , in one of seven different kinds of ways ."
"M@@ i@@ rac@@ ul@@ ously , as we asked these questions and started gi@@ ving at@@ ten@@ tion high@@ er up the py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d , what we found is we created more lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty ."
O@@ ur cu@@ st@@ om@@ er lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty sk@@ y@@ ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ted .
"O@@ ur em@@ plo@@ ye@@ e tur@@ no@@ ver dro@@ pped to one@@ -@@ third of the indu@@ stry a@@ ver@@ age , and during that five year dot@@ co@@ m b@@ ust , we tri@@ p@@ led in size ."
"As I went out and started sp@@ ending time with other le@@ ad@@ ers out there and as@@ king them how they were getting through that time , what they told me over and over again was that they just man@@ age what they can meas@@ ure ."
What we can meas@@ ure is that tan@@ gi@@ ble stuff at the bot@@ tom of the py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d .
They didn &apos;t even see the in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble stuff high@@ er up the py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d .
So I started as@@ king myself the question : How can we get le@@ ad@@ ers to start val@@ u@@ ing the in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble ?
"If we &apos;re t@@ au@@ ght as le@@ ad@@ ers to just man@@ age what we can meas@@ ure , and all we can meas@@ ure is the tan@@ gi@@ ble in life , we &apos;re mis@@ sing a whole lot of things at the top of the py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d ."
"So I went out and stud@@ ied a bu@@ n@@ ch of things , and I found a sur@@ v@@ ey that show@@ ed that 9@@ 4 percent of business le@@ ad@@ ers wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de believe that the in@@ tan@@ gi@@ b@@ les are important in their business , things like in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al pro@@ per@@ ty , their cor@@ por@@ ate culture , their br@@ and lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty , and yet , only five percent of those same le@@ ad@@ ers actually had a means of meas@@ ur@@ ing the in@@ tan@@ gi@@ b@@ les in their business ."
"So as le@@ ad@@ ers , we understand that in@@ tan@@ gi@@ b@@ les are important , but we don &apos;t have a clu@@ e how to meas@@ ure them ."
"So here &apos;s another E@@ inste@@ in quot@@ e : &quot; &quot; N@@ ot everything that can be coun@@ ted coun@@ ts , and not everything that coun@@ ts can be coun@@ ted . &quot; &quot; I h@@ ate to ar@@ gu@@ e with E@@ inste@@ in , but if that which is most val@@ u@@ able in our life and our business actually can &apos;t be coun@@ ted or val@@ u@@ ed , ar@@ en &apos;t we going to spend our lives just mi@@ red in meas@@ ur@@ ing the mu@@ n@@ dane ?"
It was that sort of he@@ ady question about what coun@@ ts that led me to take my C@@ E@@ O h@@ at off for a week and f@@ ly off to the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ an pe@@ ak@@ s .
"I f@@ le@@ w off to a place that &apos;s been sh@@ rou@@ ded in m@@ yst@@ ery for cen@@ tur@@ ies , a place some fol@@ ks call S@@ h@@ ang@@ ri@@ -@@ L@@ a ."
It &apos;s actually mo@@ ved from the survi@@ v@@ al b@@ ase of the py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d to be@@ coming a trans@@ form@@ ational ro@@ le model for the world .
I went to B@@ h@@ ut@@ an .
"The te@@ en@@ age king of B@@ h@@ ut@@ an was also a cu@@ ri@@ ous man , but this was back in 19@@ 7@@ 2 , when he as@@ cen@@ ded to the th@@ ro@@ ne two days after his father pas@@ sed away ."
"A@@ t age 1@@ 7 , he started as@@ king the kinds of questions that you &apos;d expe@@ ct of someone with a begin@@ ner &apos;s mind ."
"O@@ n a tri@@ p through Indi@@ a , early in his re@@ ig@@ n as king , he was asked by an Indi@@ an jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st about the B@@ h@@ ut@@ an@@ ese G@@ D@@ P , the size of the B@@ h@@ ut@@ an@@ ese G@@ D@@ P ."
The king respon@@ ded in a fas@@ hi@@ on that actually has trans@@ form@@ ed us four de@@ ca@@ des later .
"He said the fol@@ low@@ ing , he said : &quot; &quot; Why are we so ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed and fo@@ c@@ used with g@@ ross dom@@ esti@@ c produ@@ ct ?"
"Wh@@ y don &apos;t we care more about g@@ ross national happ@@ iness ? &quot; &quot; Now , in essen@@ ce , the king was as@@ king us to consi@@ der an alter@@ n@@ ative defini@@ tion of suc@@ cess , what has come to be known as G@@ N@@ H , or g@@ ross national happ@@ iness ."
"Mo@@ st world le@@ ad@@ ers didn &apos;t take noti@@ ce , and those that did thought this was just &quot; &quot; Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ st econ@@ omi@@ cs . &quot; &quot; But the king was seri@@ ous ."
"This was a not@@ able moment , because this was the first time a world lea@@ der in almost 2@@ 00 years had su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed that in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble of happ@@ iness — that lea@@ der 2@@ 00 years ago , Th@@ om@@ as J@@ ef@@ fer@@ son with the De@@ c@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ depen@@ dence — 2@@ 00 years later , this king was su@@ gg@@ est@@ ing that in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble of happ@@ iness is something that we should meas@@ ure , and it &apos;s something we should actually val@@ ue as government offi@@ ci@@ als ."
"For the next three do@@ z@@ en years as king , this king actually started meas@@ ur@@ ing and man@@ ag@@ ing around happ@@ iness in B@@ h@@ ut@@ an — inclu@@ ding , just re@@ cent@@ ly , taking his country from being an absolu@@ te mon@@ ar@@ chy to a con@@ stitu@@ ti@@ onal mon@@ ar@@ chy with no blo@@ od@@ shed , no cou@@ p ."
"B@@ h@@ ut@@ an , for those of you who don &apos;t know it , is the ne@@ w@@ est de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y in the world , just two years ago ."
"So as I spent time with le@@ ad@@ ers in the G@@ N@@ H movement , I got to really understand what they &apos;re doing ."
And I got to spend some time with the pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er .
"O@@ ver din@@ ner , I asked him an im@@ per@@ t@@ in@@ ent question ."
"I asked him , &quot; &quot; How can you create and meas@@ ure something which ev@@ a@@ por@@ ates — in other words , happ@@ iness ? &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s a very wi@@ se man , and he said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , B@@ h@@ ut@@ an &apos;s go@@ al is not to create happ@@ iness ."
We create the con@@ di@@ tions for happ@@ iness to oc@@ cu@@ r .
"In other words , we create a ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at of happ@@ iness . &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , that &apos;s interesting ."
"He said that they have a science behind that art , and they &apos;ve actually created four essen@@ tial pi@@ l@@ lars , n@@ ine key indi@@ cat@@ ors and 7@@ 2 different me@@ tri@@ cs that help them to meas@@ ure their G@@ N@@ H ."
One of those key indi@@ cat@@ ors is : How do the B@@ h@@ ut@@ an@@ ese feel about how they spend their time each day ?
It &apos;s a good question . How do you feel about how you spend your time each day ?
Ti@@ me is one of the sc@@ ar@@ c@@ est re@@ sources in the moder@@ n world .
"And yet , of course , that little in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble piece of data doesn &apos;t fac@@ tor into our G@@ D@@ P cal@@ cul@@ ations ."
"As I spent my week up in the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as , I started to imagine what I call an emoti@@ onal equ@@ ation ."
And it fo@@ c@@ uses on something I read long ago from a guy na@@ med R@@ ab@@ b@@ i H@@ y@@ man S@@ ch@@ ach@@ te@@ l .
How many know him ? An@@ y@@ body ?
"@@ 19@@ 5@@ 4 , he wro@@ te a book called &quot; &quot; The Re@@ al En@@ jo@@ y@@ ment of Li@@ ving , &quot; &quot; and he su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed that happ@@ iness is not about having what you want ; instead , it &apos;s about wan@@ ting what you have ."
"O@@ r in other words , I think the B@@ h@@ ut@@ an@@ ese believe happ@@ iness equ@@ als wan@@ ting what you have — imagine gr@@ ati@@ tu@@ de — di@@ vi@@ ded by having what you want — gr@@ ati@@ fi@@ cation ."
"The B@@ h@@ ut@@ an@@ ese ar@@ en &apos;t on some as@@ pi@@ r@@ ational tre@@ ad@@ mi@@ ll , con@@ stan@@ tly fo@@ c@@ used on what they don &apos;t have ."
"Th@@ e@@ ir religi@@ on , their is@@ ol@@ ation , their de@@ ep re@@ spe@@ ct for their culture and now the prin@@ ci@@ ples of their G@@ N@@ H movement all have f@@ ost@@ er@@ ed a sense of gr@@ ati@@ tu@@ de about what they do have ."
"H@@ ow many of us here , as TE@@ D@@ st@@ ers in the audience , spend more of our time in the bot@@ tom half of this equ@@ ation , in the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator ?"
We are a bot@@ tom@@ -@@ he@@ av@@ y culture in more ways than one .
"( Laughter ) The re@@ ality is , in W@@ est@@ er@@ n countries , quite often we do fo@@ cus on the pur@@ su@@ it of happ@@ iness as if happ@@ iness is something that we have to go out — an obje@@ ct that we &apos;re sup@@ posed to get , or maybe many obje@@ cts ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , in fact , if you look in the di@@ cti@@ on@@ ary , many di@@ cti@@ on@@ ar@@ ies def@@ ine pur@@ su@@ it as to &quot; &quot; ch@@ ase with h@@ ost@@ i@@ lity . &quot; &quot; Do we pur@@ su@@ e happ@@ iness with h@@ ost@@ i@@ lity ?"
Go@@ od question . But back to B@@ h@@ ut@@ an .
B@@ h@@ ut@@ an &apos;s bor@@ der@@ ed on its nor@@ th and s@@ outh by 3@@ 8 percent of the world &apos;s popul@@ ation .
"C@@ ould this little country , like a star@@ tu@@ p in a mat@@ ure indu@@ stry , be the sp@@ ar@@ k p@@ lu@@ g that in@@ flu@@ ences a 2@@ 1@@ st century of mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ clas@@ s in China and Indi@@ a ?"
"B@@ h@@ ut@@ an &apos;s created the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate ex@@ port , a new global cur@@ ren@@ cy of wel@@ l-@@ being , and there are 40 countries around the world today that are stu@@ dy@@ ing their own G@@ N@@ H ."
"You may have heard , this last f@@ all Ni@@ col@@ as S@@ ar@@ ko@@ zy in Fran@@ ce an@@ n@@ oun@@ cing the resul@@ ts of an 1@@ 8@@ -@@ mon@@ th study by two N@@ obe@@ l econom@@ ist@@ s , fo@@ c@@ using on happ@@ iness and wel@@ l@@ ness in Fran@@ ce ."
"S@@ ar@@ ko@@ zy su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed that world le@@ ad@@ ers should stop my@@ op@@ i@@ cally fo@@ c@@ using on G@@ D@@ P and consi@@ der a new in@@ de@@ x , what some F@@ ren@@ ch are cal@@ ling a &quot; &quot; jo@@ ie de vi@@ v@@ re in@@ de@@ x . &quot; &quot; I like it ."
Co@@ -@@ bran@@ ding opportuni@@ ties .
"J@@ ust three days ago , three days ago here at TED , we had a si@@ mul@@ c@@ ast of Davi@@ d C@@ am@@ er@@ on , poten@@ ti@@ ally the next pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er of the U@@ K , quot@@ ing one of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te spe@@ ech@@ es of al@@ l-@@ time , Rob@@ er@@ t Ken@@ ne@@ dy &apos;s po@@ e@@ tic spe@@ e@@ ch from 19@@ 6@@ 8 when he su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed that we &apos;re my@@ op@@ i@@ cally fo@@ c@@ used on the wrong thing and that G@@ D@@ P is a mi@@ sp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed me@@ tri@@ c ."
So it su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that the mom@@ entu@@ m is shi@@ f@@ ting .
"I &apos;ve taken that Rob@@ er@@ t Ken@@ ne@@ dy quot@@ e , and I &apos;ve turned it into a new bal@@ ance sh@@ e@@ et for just a moment here ."
This is a colle@@ ction of things that Rob@@ er@@ t Ken@@ ne@@ dy said in that quot@@ e .
G@@ D@@ P coun@@ ts everything from air pol@@ lu@@ tion to the de@@ stru@@ ction of our re@@ d@@ wo@@ ods .
But it doesn &apos;t coun@@ t the health of our children or the inte@@ g@@ ri@@ ty of our public offi@@ ci@@ als .
"As you look at these two col@@ um@@ ns here , doesn &apos;t it make you feel like it &apos;s time for us to start fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing out a new way to coun@@ t , a new way to imagine what &apos;s important to us in life ?"
( Applause ) C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly Rob@@ er@@ t Ken@@ ne@@ dy su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed at the end of the spe@@ e@@ ch exactly that .
"He said G@@ D@@ P &quot; &quot; meas@@ ures everything in shor@@ t , ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while . &quot; &quot; W@@ ow ."
So how do we do that ?
"L@@ et me say one thing we can just start doing ten years from now , at least in this country ."
Why in the he@@ ck in America are we doing a cen@@ su@@ s in 20@@ 10 ?
We &apos;re sp@@ ending 10 billion dollars on the cen@@ su@@ s .
We &apos;re as@@ king 10 simple questions — it is sim@@ pli@@ city .
But all of those questions are tan@@ gi@@ ble .
They &apos;re about demo@@ gra@@ phi@@ cs .
"They &apos;re about where you live , how many people you live with , and whether you own your home or not ."
That &apos;s about it .
We &apos;re not as@@ king me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful me@@ tri@@ cs .
We &apos;re not as@@ king important questions .
We &apos;re not as@@ king anything that &apos;s in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble .
"A@@ be M@@ as@@ low said long ago something you &apos;ve heard before , but you didn &apos;t realize it was him ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; If the only to@@ ol you have is a ha@@ m@@ m@@ er , everything star@@ ts to look like a na@@ il . &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve been fo@@ o@@ led by our to@@ ol ."
E@@ x@@ c@@ use that ex@@ pres@@ sion .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ve been fo@@ o@@ led by our to@@ ol .
G@@ D@@ P has been our ha@@ m@@ m@@ er .
And our na@@ il has been a 19@@ th@@ - and 20@@ th@@ -@@ century indu@@ stri@@ al@@ -@@ era model of suc@@ cess .
"And yet , 6@@ 4 percent of the world &apos;s G@@ D@@ P today is in that in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble indu@@ stry we call ser@@ vice , the ser@@ vice indu@@ stry , the indu@@ stry I &apos;m in ."
And only 3@@ 6 percent is in the tan@@ gi@@ ble indu@@ str@@ ies of man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing and agri@@ culture .
"So maybe it &apos;s time that we get a bi@@ g@@ ger to@@ ol@@ box , right ?"
"M@@ a@@ ybe it &apos;s time we get a to@@ ol@@ box that doesn &apos;t just coun@@ t what &apos;s e@@ a@@ si@@ ly coun@@ ted , the tan@@ gi@@ ble in life , but actually coun@@ ts what we most val@@ ue , the things that are in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble ."
I gu@@ ess I &apos;m sort of a cu@@ ri@@ ous C@@ E@@ O .
I was also a cu@@ ri@@ ous econ@@ omi@@ cs major as an under@@ gra@@ d .
I learned that econom@@ ist@@ s meas@@ ure everything in tan@@ gi@@ ble uni@@ ts of produ@@ ction and con@@ sum@@ ption as if each of those tan@@ gi@@ ble uni@@ ts is exactly the same .
They ar@@ en &apos;t the same .
"In fact , as le@@ ad@@ ers , what we need to learn is that we can in@@ flu@@ ence the qu@@ ality of that uni@@ t of produ@@ ction by cre@@ ating the con@@ di@@ tions for our em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es to live their cal@@ ling ."
"In V@@ i@@ vi@@ an &apos;s case , her uni@@ t of produ@@ ction isn &apos;t the tan@@ gi@@ ble hours she works , it &apos;s the in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble difference she makes during that one hour of work ."
This is D@@ a@@ ve Ar@@ r@@ ing@@ d@@ ale who &apos;s actually been a lon@@ g@@ time gu@@ est at V@@ i@@ vi@@ an &apos;s mot@@ el .
"He sta@@ yed there a hundre@@ d times in the last 20 years , and he &apos;s lo@@ y@@ al to the pro@@ per@@ ty because of the relation@@ ship that V@@ i@@ vi@@ an and her fel@@ low em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es have created with him ."
They &apos;ve created a ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at of happ@@ iness for D@@ a@@ ve .
He tel@@ ls me that he can always coun@@ t on V@@ i@@ vi@@ an and the st@@ af@@ f there to make him feel at home .
Why is it that business le@@ ad@@ ers and inv@@ est@@ ors quite often don &apos;t see the conne@@ ction between cre@@ ating the in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble of em@@ plo@@ ye@@ e happ@@ iness with cre@@ ating the tan@@ gi@@ ble of fin@@ an@@ cial pro@@ fi@@ ts in their business ?
"We don &apos;t have to cho@@ ose between inspi@@ red em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es and si@@ z@@ able pro@@ fi@@ ts , we can have both ."
"In fact , inspi@@ red em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es quite often help make si@@ z@@ able pro@@ fi@@ ts , right ?"
"So what the world needs now , in my op@@ ini@@ on , is business le@@ ad@@ ers and poli@@ tical le@@ ad@@ ers who know what to coun@@ t ."
We coun@@ t num@@ bers .
We coun@@ t on people .
What really coun@@ ts is when we actually use our num@@ bers to tru@@ ly take into ac@@ coun@@ t our people .
I learned that from a ma@@ id in a mot@@ el and a king of a country .
What can you start coun@@ ting today ?
"What one thing can you start coun@@ ting today that actually would be me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful in your life , whether it &apos;s your work life or your business life ?"
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"@@ &#91; And &#93; then a P@@ l@@ ank in Re@@ as@@ on , bro@@ ke , and I fe@@ ll down and down — and h@@ it a World , at every p@@ lu@@ n@@ ge , and F@@ ini@@ shed know@@ ing — then — &quot; &quot; We know de@@ pres@@ sion through me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ors ."
"E@@ mi@@ ly D@@ i@@ ck@@ in@@ son was able to con@@ v@@ ey it in language , Go@@ ya in an image ."
"In 199@@ 1 , I had a ser@@ ies of lo@@ s@@ ses ."
You know it &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous while you &apos;re exper@@ ien@@ cing it .
And then the an@@ x@@ ie@@ ty set in .
The next day I started with the medi@@ c@@ ations and the ther@@ ap@@ y .
And the other was that I had ac@@ cess to good tre@@ at@@ ment .
De@@ pres@@ sion is the f@@ la@@ w in love .
What are the mechani@@ s@@ ms that al@@ low people to survi@@ ve ?
But the tru@@ th l@@ ies .
I became ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with that s@@ ent@@ ence : &quot; But the tru@@ th l@@ ies . &quot;
"And then she said , &quot; &quot; You know , my h@@ us@@ b@@ and would never understand this ."
De@@ pres@@ sion is so ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ing .
I su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed to her that she also should look up ob@@ s@@ es@@ sive com@@ pul@@ sive di@@ sor@@ der in the D@@ S@@ M .
They didn &apos;t inclu@@ de dru@@ m@@ ming or music to get people &apos;s blo@@ od going .
He was con@@ stan@@ tly de@@ pres@@ sed .
Th@@ en he would feel sort of di@@ sor@@ ien@@ ted for a week .
Th@@ en he would feel o@@ kay for a week .
Th@@ en he would have a week of going dow@@ n@@ hi@@ ll .
"And he had the cin@@ gu@@ lot@@ om@@ y , and it was incredi@@ bly suc@@ cess@@ ful ."
He &apos;s now a friend of m@@ ine .
I &apos;m ali@@ ve and gr@@ ate@@ ful .
"One of them , L@@ ol@@ ly , came in , and this is what she said the day she came in ."
"My h@@ us@@ b@@ and has been tel@@ ling me I &apos;m stu@@ pi@@ d , I &apos;m u@@ g@@ ly ."
Th@@ ose are the things that I feel sa@@ d about now .
"And I said to myself , well , what is the con@@ clu@@ sion ?"
How did those people who have better lives even with bi@@ g@@ ger de@@ pres@@ sion man@@ age to get through ?
"S@@ ome@@ one once said that poli@@ ti@@ cs is , of course , &quot; &quot; show@@ bi@@ z for u@@ g@@ ly people . &quot; &quot; So , on that basi@@ s , I feel like I &apos;ve really ar@@ ri@@ ved ."
"The other thing to think of is what an hon@@ or it is , as a poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an , to give a TED talk , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly here in the U.@@ K@@ . , where the re@@ pu@@ tation of poli@@ ti@@ cs , with the ex@@ pen@@ ses sc@@ and@@ al , has su@@ n@@ k so low ."
There was even a story re@@ cent@@ ly that scienti@@ sts had thought about actually re@@ plac@@ ing rat@@ s in their experim@@ ents with poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans .
"And someone asked , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s no shor@@ t@@ age of poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans , no one really min@@ ds what happens to them and , after all , there are some things that rat@@ s just won &apos;t do . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , I know you all love data , so I &apos;m star@@ ting with a d@@ at@@ a@@ -@@ ri@@ ch sli@@ de ."
"This , I think , is the most important fact to be@@ ar in mind in Bri@@ ti@@ sh poli@@ ti@@ cs or American poli@@ ti@@ cs , and that is : We have run out of money ."
We have v@@ ast bud@@ get de@@ fi@@ ci@@ ts .
"This is my global public de@@ b@@ t clo@@ ck , and , as you can see , it &apos;s 3@@ 2 tri@@ llion and coun@@ ting ."
"And I think what this le@@ ads to is a very simple re@@ cogni@@ tion , that there &apos;s one question in poli@@ ti@@ cs at the moment ab@@ o@@ ve all other , and it &apos;s this one : How do we make things better without sp@@ ending more money ?"
"Because there isn &apos;t going to be a lot of money to impro@@ ve public ser@@ vi@@ ces , or to impro@@ ve government , or to impro@@ ve so many of the things that poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans talk about ."
"So what fol@@ low@@ s from that is that if you think it &apos;s all about money — you can only meas@@ ure suc@@ cess in public ser@@ vi@@ ces in health care and education and poli@@ cing by sp@@ ending more money , you can only meas@@ ure pro@@ gre@@ ss by sp@@ ending money — you &apos;re going to have a pretty mi@@ ser@@ able time ."
"But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that le@@ ad up to well being — things like your family relation@@ ships , frien@@ d@@ ship , community , val@@ u@@ es — then , actually , this is an incredi@@ bly exci@@ ting time to be in poli@@ ti@@ cs ."
"And the really simple ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent I want to make ton@@ ight , the really stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent is this : That if we com@@ b@@ ine the right poli@@ tical phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y , the right poli@@ tical thinking , with the incredible information re@@ v@@ olution that has taken place , and that all of you know so much more about than I do , I think there &apos;s an incredible opportunity to actually re@@ make poli@@ ti@@ cs , re@@ make government , re@@ make public ser@@ vi@@ ces , and ach@@ ie@@ ve what &apos;s up on that sli@@ de , which is a big incre@@ ase in our wel@@ l-@@ being ."
That &apos;s the ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent I want to make ton@@ ight .
"So , star@@ ting with the poli@@ tical phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y ."
Now I &apos;m not saying for a minu@@ te that Bri@@ ti@@ sh Con@@ ser@@ v@@ ati@@ ves have all the ans@@ w@@ ers .
O@@ f course we don &apos;t .
But there are two things at heart that I think dri@@ ve a con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y that are really rele@@ v@@ ant to this whole de@@ b@@ ate .
"The first is this : We believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives , if you give people more cho@@ ice , if you put them in the dri@@ ving se@@ at , then actually , you can create a stron@@ ger and better society ."
"And if you mar@@ ry this fact with the incredible ab@@ un@@ dance of information that we have in our world today , I think you can completely , as I &apos;ve said , re@@ make poli@@ ti@@ cs , re@@ make government , re@@ make your public ser@@ vi@@ ces ."
The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the gra@@ in of human nature .
"Po@@ li@@ ti@@ cs and poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans will only suc@@ ce@@ ed if they actually try and tre@@ at with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be ."
"Now , if you com@@ b@@ ine this very simple , very con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative thought — go with the gra@@ in of human nature — with all the adv@@ an@@ ces in behavi@@ or@@ al econ@@ omi@@ cs , some of which we were just hear@@ ing about , again , I think we can ach@@ ie@@ ve a real incre@@ ase in wel@@ l-@@ being , in happ@@ iness , in a stron@@ ger society without ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly having to spend a whole lot more money ."
"Now , why do I think now is the moment to make this ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent ?"
"Well , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;re going to su@@ f@@ f@@ er a shor@@ t , con@@ den@@ sed history l@@ es@@ son about what I would say are the three pas@@ s@@ ages of history : the pre@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ r@@ atic age , the bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ r@@ atic age and what we now live in , which I think is a post@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ r@@ atic age ."
"A sim@@ ple@@ r way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of local control , then we went to a world of cent@@ ral control , and now we &apos;re in a world of people control ."
"L@@ o@@ cal power , cent@@ ral power , now , people power ."
"Now , here is K@@ ing C@@ nu@@ t , king a thous@@ and years ago ."
Th@@ ou@@ ght he could turn back the wa@@ ves ; couldn &apos;t turn back the wa@@ ves .
"C@@ ouldn &apos;t actually turn back very much , because if you were king a thous@@ and years ago , while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to tra@@ verse your own country , there wasn &apos;t much you were in char@@ ge of ."
"You wer@@ en &apos;t in char@@ ge of poli@@ cing , ju@@ sti@@ ce , education , health , wel@@ f@@ are ."
You could just about go to war and that was about it .
"This was the pre@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ r@@ atic age , an age in which everything had to be local ."
You had to have local control because there was no n@@ ati@@ on@@ al@@ ly@@ -@@ available information because tra@@ vel was so re@@ stri@@ cted .
So this was the pre@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ r@@ atic age .
"N@@ ex@@ t part of the c@@ old history l@@ es@@ son , the lo@@ vely picture of the Bri@@ ti@@ sh In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ ev@@ olution ."
"S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly , all sor@@ ts of transpor@@ t , tra@@ vel information were possible , and this gave bir@@ th to , what I like to call , the bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ r@@ atic age ."
And hop@@ e@@ fully this sli@@ de is going to mor@@ ph beauti@@ fully . There we are .
"S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly , you have the big , stron@@ g , cent@@ ral state ."
"It was able — but only it was able — to organi@@ ze health care , education , poli@@ cing , ju@@ sti@@ ce ."
"And it was a world of , as I say , not local power , but now cent@@ ral power ."
It had suc@@ ked all that power up from the lo@@ c@@ ali@@ ties .
It was able to do that itself .
"The next great st@@ age , which all of you are so fami@@ li@@ ar with : the mas@@ sive information re@@ v@@ olution ."
"J@@ ust consi@@ der this one fact : One hundre@@ d years ago , sen@@ ding these 10 words cost 50 dollars ."
"R@@ ight now , here we are lin@@ ked up to L@@ ong Be@@ ach and every@@ where else , and all these se@@ cre@@ t lo@@ c@@ ations for a f@@ rac@@ tion of that cost , and we can sen@@ d and re@@ cei@@ ve huge qu@@ anti@@ ties of information without it co@@ st@@ ing anything ."
"So we &apos;re now living in a post@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ r@@ atic age , where gen@@ u@@ ine people power is possible ."
"Now , what does this mean for our poli@@ ti@@ cs , for our public ser@@ vi@@ ces , for our government ?"
"Well I can &apos;t , in the time I &apos;ve got , give huge num@@ bers of exam@@ ples , but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change ."
"And this is so obvi@@ ous , in a way , because you think about how all of you have changed the way we sho@@ p , the way we tra@@ vel , the way that business is done ."
"That is already happened ; the information and Inter@@ net re@@ v@@ olution has actually gone all the way through our socie@@ ties in so many different ways , but it ha@@ sn &apos;t , in every way , yet tou@@ ched our government ."
"So , how could this happen ?"
"Well , I think there are three ch@@ ie@@ f ways that it should make an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous difference : in tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy , in gre@@ ater cho@@ ice and in ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability , in gi@@ ving us that gen@@ u@@ ine people power ."
"If we take tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy , here is one of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te we@@ b@@ si@@ tes , the M@@ is@@ sour@@ i A@@ c@@ coun@@ t@@ ability P@@ or@@ tal ."
"In the old days , only the government could h@@ old the information , and only a few ele@@ cted people could try and gra@@ b that information and question it and challen@@ ge it ."
"Now here , on one we@@ b@@ site , one state in America , every single dol@@ lar spent by that government is sear@@ ch@@ able , is an@@ al@@ yz@@ able , is che@@ ck@@ able ."
Th@@ in@@ k of the huge change that means : A@@ ny business that wan@@ ts to bi@@ d for a government con@@ trac@@ t can see what cur@@ r@@ ently is being spent .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ one thinking , &quot; &quot; I could do that ser@@ vice better , I could deli@@ ver it che@@ ap@@ er , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all available there ."
"We have only , in government and in poli@@ ti@@ cs , started to sc@@ rat@@ ch the surface of what people are doing in the comm@@ er@@ cial world with the information re@@ v@@ olution ."
"So , comple@@ te tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy will make a huge difference ."
"In this country , if we wi@@ n the ele@@ ction , we are going to make all government sp@@ ending over 2@@ 5@@ ,000 po@@ un@@ ds tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent and available on@@ line , sear@@ ch@@ able for any@@ one to see ."
"We &apos;re going to make every con@@ trac@@ t — we &apos;re an@@ n@@ oun@@ cing this today — available on the Inter@@ net so any@@ one can see what the terms are , what the con@@ di@@ tions are , dri@@ ving huge val@@ ue for money , but also huge incre@@ ases , I believe , in wel@@ l-@@ being as well ."
"Cho@@ ice . Now you all sho@@ p on@@ line , comp@@ are on@@ line , do everything on@@ line , and yet this re@@ v@@ olution has har@@ d@@ ly tou@@ ched the surface of public ser@@ vi@@ ces like education , or health care or poli@@ cing , and you &apos;re going to see this change mas@@ si@@ vely ."
"We should be making this change with the information re@@ v@@ olution in our country , with sear@@ ch@@ able health si@@ tes , so you can see what oper@@ ations work out pro@@ per@@ ly , what recor@@ ds do@@ ct@@ ors have , the cle@@ an@@ lin@@ ess of ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s , who does best at in@@ fe@@ ction control — all of the information that would once be lo@@ cked in the De@@ part@@ ment of H@@ e@@ alth is now available for all of us to see ."
And the third of these big chang@@ es : ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability .
"This , I think , is a huge change ."
It is a cri@@ me ma@@ p . This is a cri@@ me ma@@ p from Chi@@ ca@@ go .
"So , instead of having a situ@@ ation where only the poli@@ ce have the information about which cri@@ mes are com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted where , and we have to em@@ plo@@ y people in government to try and h@@ old the poli@@ ce to ac@@ coun@@ t , sud@@ den@@ ly , we &apos;ve got this v@@ ast opportunity for people power , where we , as ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , can see what cri@@ mes are being com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted — where , when and by wh@@ om — and we can h@@ old the poli@@ ce to ac@@ coun@@ t ."
"And you can see this looks a bit like a che@@ f &apos;s h@@ at , but actually that &apos;s an as@@ sa@@ ul@@ t , the one in blue ."
"You can see what cri@@ me is com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted where , and you have the opportunity to h@@ old your poli@@ ce force to ac@@ coun@@ t ."
"So those three ways — tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy , ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability and cho@@ ice — will make a huge difference ."
"Now I also said the other prin@@ ci@@ ple that I think we should work on is under@@ standing of people , is re@@ cogni@@ z@@ ing that going with the gra@@ in of human nature you can ach@@ ie@@ ve so much more ."
"Now , we &apos;re got a huge re@@ v@@ olution in under@@ standing of why people be@@ have in the way that they do , and a great opportunity to put that know@@ le@@ dge and information to gre@@ ater use ."
We &apos;re working with some of these people .
"We &apos;re being ad@@ vi@@ sed by some of these people , as was said , to try and bring all the experience to book ."
"L@@ et me just give you one example that I think is incredi@@ bly simple , and I love ."
We want to get people to be more energy ef@@ fi@@ cient .
"Wh@@ y ? It cu@@ ts fu@@ el po@@ ver@@ ty , it cu@@ ts their bi@@ l@@ ls , and it cu@@ ts car@@ b@@ on e@@ mis@@ sions at the same time ."
How do you do it ?
"Well , we &apos;ve had government information cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ns over the years when they tell you to s@@ wit@@ ch off the li@@ ghts when you leave the home ."
We even had — one government min@@ ist@@ er once told us to br@@ us@@ h our te@@ e@@ th in the dar@@ k .
I don &apos;t think they la@@ st@@ ed very long .
L@@ ook at what this does . This is a simple piece of behavi@@ or@@ al econ@@ omi@@ cs .
"The best way to get someone to cut their electri@@ city bi@@ ll is to show them their own sp@@ ending , to show them what their neigh@@ b@@ ors are sp@@ ending , and then show what an energy con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous neigh@@ b@@ or is sp@@ ending ."
That sort of behavi@@ or@@ al econ@@ omi@@ cs can trans@@ form people &apos;s behavi@@ or in a way that all the bu@@ ll@@ ying and all the information and all the bad@@ g@@ ering from a government cannot possi@@ bly ach@@ ie@@ ve .
O@@ ther exam@@ ples are re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling .
We all know we need to re@@ cy@@ cle more .
How do we make it happen ?
"A@@ ll the pro@@ of from America is that actually , if you pay people to re@@ cy@@ cle , if you give them a car@@ ro@@ t rather than a sti@@ ck , you can trans@@ form their behavi@@ or ."
So what does all this ad@@ d up to ?
Here are my two fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te U.@@ S. spe@@ ech@@ es of the last 50 years .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , here we have J@@ F@@ K with that incredi@@ bly simple and powerful for@@ mul@@ ation , &quot; A@@ sk not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country , &quot; an incredi@@ bly no@@ ble sen@@ ti@@ ment ."
"But when he made that spe@@ e@@ ch , what could you do to build the stron@@ ger , better society ?"
"You could fi@@ ght for your country , you could die for your country , you could ser@@ ve in your country &apos;s ci@@ vi@@ l ser@@ vice , but you didn &apos;t really have the information and the know@@ le@@ dge and the ability to help build the stron@@ ger society in the way that you do now ."
"And I think an even more wonderful spe@@ e@@ ch , which I &apos;m going to read a big ch@@ un@@ k of , which su@@ ms up what I said at the beginning about belie@@ ving there is more to life than money , and more that we should try and meas@@ ure than money ."
"And it is Rob@@ er@@ t Ken@@ ne@@ dy &apos;s beautiful descri@@ ption of why g@@ ross national produ@@ ct cap@@ tu@@ res so little : It &quot; &quot; does not al@@ low for the health of our children , the qu@@ ality of their education , or the jo@@ y of their play ."
"It does not inclu@@ de the beau@@ ty of our po@@ e@@ try or the str@@ eng@@ th of our mar@@ ri@@ ages , the inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence of our public de@@ b@@ ate ."
"It meas@@ ures ne@@ i@@ ther our wi@@ t no@@ r our cou@@ ra@@ ge , ne@@ i@@ ther our wi@@ s@@ dom no@@ r our lear@@ ning , ne@@ i@@ ther our comp@@ as@@ sion no@@ r our de@@ v@@ oti@@ on to our country ."
"It meas@@ ures everything , in shor@@ t , ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while . &quot; &quot; A@@ ga@@ in , a sen@@ ti@@ ment that was so no@@ ble and beauti@@ fully put 40 years ago , and a beautiful dre@@ am 40 years ago , but now with the huge adv@@ an@@ ces in information technology , with the mas@@ sive chang@@ es in behavi@@ or@@ al econ@@ omi@@ cs , with all that we know about how you adv@@ ance wel@@ l-@@ being , that if we com@@ b@@ ine those in@@ si@@ ghts of gi@@ ving power to people , and using information to make that possible , and using the in@@ si@@ ght of going with the gra@@ in of human nature , while at the same time , under@@ standing why people be@@ have in the way they do ,"
it is a dre@@ am more e@@ asy to realize today than it was when it was made in that beautiful spe@@ e@@ ch 40 years ago .
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Laughter ) I was wor@@ ried .
"It sounds like an in@@ fe@@ ction , at best ."
"It &apos;s a body world , and the species really ex@@ ist@@ s in the body ."
And always as a child I had this fan@@ t@@ asy that somebody would come and re@@ s@@ cu@@ e me .
And I actually made up a little char@@ ac@@ ter wh@@ ose name was M@@ r. A@@ lli@@ gat@@ or .
"So , ste@@ pping down out of the bu@@ s , I he@@ ad@@ ed back to the cor@@ ner to head w@@ est en rou@@ te to a bra@@ il@@ le tra@@ ining s@@ es@@ sion ."
"It was the win@@ ter of 200@@ 9 , and I had been bl@@ ind for about a year ."
Th@@ ings were going pretty well .
"S@@ a@@ fe@@ ly re@@ ach@@ ing the other side , I turned to the left , p@@ us@@ h@@ ed the au@@ to@@ -@@ bu@@ t@@ ton for the au@@ di@@ ble pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an sig@@ na@@ l , and wai@@ ted my turn ."
"As it went off , I took off and sa@@ fe@@ ly got to the other side ."
"S@@ te@@ pping on@@ to the si@@ de@@ walk , I then heard the sound of a ste@@ el cha@@ ir sli@@ de across the con@@ cre@@ te si@@ de@@ walk in front of me ."

"As I did , so sli@@ d the cha@@ ir ."
"I just figu@@ red I &apos;d made a mist@@ ake , and went back to the right , and so sli@@ d the cha@@ ir in perfe@@ ct syn@@ chro@@ ni@@ city ."
Now I was getting a little an@@ x@@ i@@ ous .
"I went back to the left , and so sli@@ d the cha@@ ir , blo@@ c@@ king my pat@@ h of tra@@ vel ."
"Now , I was offi@@ cially fre@@ aking out ."
"So I y@@ el@@ led , &quot; Wh@@ o the he@@ ll &apos;s out there ? What &apos;s going on ? &quot;"
"J@@ ust then , over my sh@@ out , I heard something else , a fami@@ li@@ ar rat@@ tle ."
"It soun@@ ded fami@@ li@@ ar , and I quickly consi@@ der@@ ed another possi@@ bility , and I re@@ ach@@ ed out with my left hand , as my fin@@ g@@ ers br@@ us@@ h@@ ed against something fu@@ z@@ zy , and I came across an e@@ ar , the e@@ ar of a do@@ g , per@@ haps a g@@ ol@@ den re@@ tr@@ ie@@ ver ."
"I@@ ts le@@ as@@ h had been t@@ ied to the cha@@ ir as her ma@@ ster went in for co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , and she was just per@@ si@@ st@@ ent in her ef@@ for@@ ts to gre@@ et me , per@@ haps get a sc@@ rat@@ ch behind the e@@ ar ."
"Wh@@ o know@@ s , maybe she was vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering for ser@@ vice ."
"( Laughter ) But that little story is really about the fe@@ ars and mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tions that come along with the idea of moving through the city without si@@ ght , seem@@ ing@@ ly ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous to the environment and the people around you ."
So let me ste@@ p back and set the st@@ age a little bit .
"O@@ n St@@ . P@@ at@@ ri@@ ck &apos;s D@@ ay of 200@@ 8 , I re@@ por@@ ted to the ho@@ spit@@ al for sur@@ g@@ ery to re@@ move a brain tu@@ mo@@ r ."
The sur@@ g@@ ery was suc@@ cess@@ ful .
"T@@ wo days later , my si@@ ght started to fa@@ il ."
"O@@ n the third day , it was gone ."
"I@@ m@@ medi@@ ately , I was stru@@ ck by an incredible sense of fe@@ ar , of con@@ fu@@ sion , of v@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability , like any@@ body would ."
"But as I had time to stop and think , I actually started to realize I had a lot to be gr@@ ate@@ ful for ."
"In particular , I thought about my d@@ ad , who had pas@@ sed away from comp@@ lic@@ ations from brain sur@@ g@@ ery ."
He was 3@@ 6 . I was seven at the time .
"So al@@ though I had every reason to be fe@@ ar@@ ful of what was a@@ head , and had no clu@@ e quite what was going to happen , I was ali@@ ve ."
My son still had his d@@ ad .
"And be@@ si@@ des , it &apos;s not like I was the first person ever to lo@@ se their si@@ ght ."
"I knew there had to be all sor@@ ts of systems and techni@@ qu@@ es and tra@@ ining to have to live a full and me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful , ac@@ tive life without si@@ ght ."
"So by the time I was dis@@ char@@ g@@ ed from the ho@@ spit@@ al a few days later , I left with a mis@@ sion , a mis@@ sion to get out and get the best tra@@ ining as quickly as I could and get on to re@@ building my life ."
"Wi@@ th@@ in six months , I had re@@ turned to work ."
My tra@@ ining had started .
"I even started ri@@ ding a tan@@ dem bi@@ ke with my old cy@@ c@@ ling bu@@ dd@@ ies , and was com@@ mu@@ ting to work on my own , wal@@ king through tow@@ n and taking the bu@@ s ."
It was a lot of hard work .
But what I didn &apos;t anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate through that ra@@ pi@@ d tran@@ si@@ tion was the incredible experience of the ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posi@@ tion of my si@@ gh@@ ted experience up against my un@@ si@@ gh@@ ted experience of the same places and the same people within such a shor@@ t per@@ i@@ od of time .
"F@@ ro@@ m that came a lot of in@@ si@@ ghts , or out@@ si@@ ghts , as I called them , things that I learned since lo@@ sing my si@@ ght ."
"These out@@ si@@ ghts r@@ ang@@ ed from the tri@@ v@@ al to the pro@@ found , from the mu@@ n@@ dane to the hu@@ mo@@ rou@@ s ."
"As an archite@@ ct , that star@@ k ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posi@@ tion of my si@@ gh@@ ted and un@@ si@@ gh@@ ted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a shor@@ t per@@ i@@ od of time has given me all sor@@ ts of wonderful out@@ si@@ ghts of the city itself ."
"P@@ ar@@ amount am@@ on@@ g@@ st those was the realiz@@ ation that , actually , cities are fanta@@ stic places for the bl@@ ind ."
And then I was also sur@@ pri@@ sed by the city &apos;s pro@@ pen@@ sity for kin@@ d@@ ness and care as op@@ posed to in@@ difference or wor@@ se .
And then I started to realize that it seem@@ ed like the bl@@ ind seem@@ ed to have a posi@@ tive in@@ flu@@ ence on the city itself .
That was a little cu@@ ri@@ ous to me .
Let me ste@@ p back and take a look at why the city is so good for the bl@@ ind .
"In@@ her@@ ent with the tra@@ ining for re@@ co@@ very from si@@ ght lo@@ ss is lear@@ ning to re@@ ly on all your n@@ on-@@ vi@@ su@@ al sen@@ ses , things that you would o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se maybe ig@@ nor@@ e ."
It &apos;s like a whole new world of sen@@ sor@@ y information open@@ s up to you .
"I was really stru@@ ck by the sym@@ ph@@ ony of sub@@ tle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are , how you need to move , and where you need to go ."
"S@@ imi@@ lar@@ ly , just through the g@@ ri@@ p of the c@@ ane , you can feel con@@ tra@@ st@@ ing te@@ x@@ tu@@ res in the flo@@ or be@@ low , and over time you build a pat@@ ter@@ n of where you are and where you &apos;re he@@ ad@@ ed ."
"S@@ imi@@ lar@@ ly , just the su@@ n war@@ ming one side of your face or the wind at your ne@@ ck gi@@ ves you clu@@ es about your ali@@ gn@@ ment and your pro@@ gre@@ s@@ sion through a blo@@ ck and your movement through time and space ."
"But also , the sense of s@@ me@@ ll ."
"S@@ ome di@@ stri@@ cts and cities have their own s@@ me@@ ll , as do places and things around you , and if you &apos;re lu@@ ck@@ y , you can even fol@@ low your no@@ se to that new b@@ ak@@ ery that you &apos;ve been looking for ."
"A@@ ll this really sur@@ pri@@ sed me , because I started to realize that my un@@ si@@ gh@@ ted exper@@ ien@@ ced was so far more mul@@ ti@@ -@@ sen@@ sor@@ y than my si@@ gh@@ ted experience ever was ."
What stru@@ ck me also was how much the city was chang@@ ing around me .
"When you &apos;re si@@ gh@@ ted , everybody kind of sti@@ cks to themselves , you mind your own business ."
"L@@ ose your si@@ ght , though , and it &apos;s a whole other story ."
"And I don &apos;t know who &apos;s wat@@ ching who , but I have a s@@ us@@ pi@@ ci@@ on that a lot of people are wat@@ ching me ."
"And I &apos;m not par@@ an@@ o@@ id , but every@@ where I go , I &apos;m getting all sor@@ ts of ad@@ vice : G@@ o here , move there , wat@@ ch out for this ."
A lot of the information is good .
S@@ ome of it &apos;s hel@@ p@@ ful . A lot of it &apos;s kind of re@@ ver@@ sed .
You &apos;ve got to figure out what they actually me@@ ant .
S@@ ome of it &apos;s kind of wrong and not hel@@ p@@ ful .
But it &apos;s all good in the gr@@ and s@@ che@@ me of things .
"But one time I was in O@@ ak@@ land wal@@ king along B@@ ro@@ ad@@ way , and came to a cor@@ ner ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s like , there was no es@@ cape from this man &apos;s death g@@ ri@@ p , but he got me sa@@ fe@@ ly there ."
What could I do ?
"But believe me , there are more poli@@ te ways to of@@ f@@ er as@@ si@@ stance ."
"We don &apos;t know you &apos;re there , so it &apos;s kind of nice to say &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ l@@ o &quot; &quot; first ."
&quot; W@@ ould you like some help ? &quot;
"But while in O@@ ak@@ land , I &apos;ve really been stru@@ ck by how much the city of O@@ ak@@ land changed as I lost my si@@ ght ."
I li@@ ked it si@@ gh@@ ted . It was f@@ ine .
It &apos;s a perfe@@ ct@@ ly great city .
"But once I lost my si@@ ght and was wal@@ king along B@@ ro@@ ad@@ way , I was bl@@ ess@@ ed every blo@@ ck of the way ."
"&quot; B@@ less you , man . &quot;"
"&quot; G@@ o for it , bro@@ ther . &quot;"
&quot; God bl@@ ess you . &quot;
I didn &apos;t get that si@@ gh@@ ted .
"( Laughter ) And even without si@@ ght , I don &apos;t get that in S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co ."
"And I know it bo@@ thers some of my bl@@ ind friends , it &apos;s not just me ."
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s thought that that &apos;s an emoti@@ on that comes up out of pi@@ ty .
"I ten@@ d to think that it comes out of our sh@@ ared hum@@ ani@@ ty , out of our toge@@ ther@@ ness , and I think it &apos;s pretty cool ."
"In fact , if I &apos;m feeling down , I just go to B@@ ro@@ ad@@ way in dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n O@@ ak@@ land , I go for a walk , and I feel better like that , in no time at all ."
"But also that it il@@ lu@@ str@@ ates how dis@@ ability and b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness sort of cu@@ ts across e@@ th@@ nic , social , rac@@ i@@ al , economic lin@@ es ."
D@@ is@@ ability is an equ@@ al@@ -@@ opportunity provi@@ der .
E@@ very@@ body &apos;s wel@@ come .
"In fact , I &apos;ve heard it said in the dis@@ ability community that there are really only two typ@@ es of people : There are those with dis@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies , and there are those that ha@@ ven &apos;t quite found the@@ ir@@ s yet ."
"It &apos;s a different way of thinking about it , but I think it &apos;s kind of beautiful , because it is cer@@ tain@@ ly far more inclu@@ sive than the us@@ -@@ vers@@ us@@ -@@ them or the ab@@ le@@ d-@@ vers@@ us@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ dis@@ ab@@ led , and it &apos;s a lot more hon@@ est and re@@ spe@@ ct@@ ful of the fra@@ gi@@ lity of life ."
"So my fin@@ al tak@@ e@@ away for you is that not only is the city good for the bl@@ ind , but the city needs us ."
"And I &apos;m so sure of that that I want to pro@@ pos@@ e to you today that the bl@@ ind be taken as the pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pi@@ cal city dw@@ el@@ l@@ ers when imag@@ ining new and wonderful cities , and not the people that are thought about after the mo@@ ld has already been c@@ ast ."
It &apos;s too l@@ ate then .
"So if you design a city with the bl@@ ind in mind , you &apos;ll have a ri@@ ch , wal@@ k@@ able network of si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks with a den@@ se ar@@ ra@@ y of op@@ tions and cho@@ i@@ ces all available at the stre@@ et level ."
"If you design a city with the bl@@ ind in mind , si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks will be pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able and will be gener@@ ous ."
The space between buil@@ dings will be wel@@ l-@@ bal@@ an@@ ced between people and cars .
"In fact , cars , who needs them ?"
"If you &apos;re bl@@ ind , you don &apos;t dri@@ ve . ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t like it when you dri@@ ve . ( Laughter ) If you design a city with the bl@@ ind in mind , you design a city with a rob@@ ust , ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble , wel@@ l-@@ conne@@ cted mas@@ s tran@@ si@@ t system that conne@@ cts all par@@ ts of the city and the regi@@ on all around . If you design a city with the bl@@ ind in mind ,"
"@@ there &apos;ll be j@@ ob@@ s , lots of j@@ ob@@ s ."
B@@ l@@ ind people want to work too .
They want to ear@@ n a living .
"So , in desig@@ ning a city for the bl@@ ind , I hope you start to realize that it actually would be a more inclu@@ sive , a more equ@@ it@@ able , a more just city for all ."
"And based on my pri@@ or si@@ gh@@ ted experience , it sounds like a pretty cool city , whether you &apos;re bl@@ ind , whether you have a dis@@ ability , or you ha@@ ven &apos;t quite found y@@ ours yet ."
So th@@ ank you .
( Applause )
"H@@ um@@ ans in the develo@@ ped world spend more than 90 percent of their lives in@@ do@@ ors , where they bre@@ a@@ the in and come into cont@@ act with tri@@ llions of life form@@ s in@@ visi@@ ble to the na@@ ked ey@@ e : micro@@ organi@@ s@@ ms ."
"@@ Bu@@ il@@ dings are comple@@ x e@@ co@@ systems that are an important source of micro@@ be@@ s that are good for us , and some that are bad for us ."
What de@@ ter@@ min@@ es the typ@@ es and di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tions of micro@@ be@@ s in@@ do@@ ors ?
Bu@@ il@@ dings are col@@ oni@@ zed by air@@ bor@@ ne micro@@ be@@ s that enter through win@@ dow@@ s and through mechani@@ cal v@@ enti@@ l@@ ation systems .
And they are brought inside by hum@@ ans and other cre@@ at@@ ures .
"The f@@ ate of micro@@ be@@ s in@@ do@@ ors depen@@ ds on comple@@ x inter@@ ac@@ tions with hum@@ ans , and with the hum@@ an@@ -@@ built environment ."
"And today , archite@@ cts and biologi@@ sts are working together to expl@@ ore s@@ mar@@ t building design that will create health@@ y buil@@ dings for us ."
"We spend an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary amount of time in buil@@ dings that are extre@@ me@@ ly contro@@ l@@ led environ@@ ments , like this building here — environ@@ ments that have mechani@@ cal v@@ enti@@ l@@ ation systems that inclu@@ de fil@@ ter@@ ing , he@@ ating and air con@@ di@@ tion@@ ing ."
"G@@ i@@ ven the amount of time that we spend in@@ do@@ ors , it &apos;s important to understand how this af@@ fe@@ cts our health ."
"A@@ t the Bi@@ o@@ logy and the Bu@@ il@@ t En@@ viron@@ ment C@@ enter , we car@@ ried out a study in a ho@@ spit@@ al where we sam@@ p@@ led air and pul@@ led the DNA out of micro@@ be@@ s in the air ."
And we looked at three different typ@@ es of ro@@ oms .
"We looked at ro@@ oms that were mechani@@ cally v@@ enti@@ lated , which are the data poin@@ ts in the blue ."
"We looked at ro@@ oms that were natur@@ ally v@@ enti@@ lated , where the ho@@ spit@@ al let us turn off the mechani@@ cal v@@ enti@@ l@@ ation in a w@@ ing of the building and p@@ ry open the win@@ dow@@ s that were no longer oper@@ able , but they made them oper@@ able for our study ."
And we also sam@@ p@@ led the out@@ door air .
"If you look at the x@@ -@@ ax@@ is of this gra@@ ph , you &apos;ll see that what we com@@ mon@@ ly want to do — which is ke@@ e@@ ping the out@@ do@@ ors out — we ac@@ comp@@ li@@ shed that with mechani@@ cal v@@ enti@@ l@@ ation ."
"So if you look at the green data poin@@ ts , which is air that &apos;s outside , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a large amount of mi@@ c@@ robi@@ al di@@ versity , or v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of mi@@ c@@ robi@@ al typ@@ es ."
"But if you look at the blue data poin@@ ts , which is mechani@@ cally v@@ enti@@ lated air , it &apos;s not as di@@ verse ."
But being less di@@ verse is not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly good for our health .
"If you look at the y@@ -@@ ax@@ is of this gra@@ ph , you &apos;ll see that , in the mechani@@ cally v@@ enti@@ lated air , you have a high@@ er prob@@ ability of en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing a poten@@ tial pa@@ th@@ og@@ en , or ger@@ m , than if you &apos;re out@@ do@@ ors ."
"So to understand why this was the case , we took our data and put it into an ordin@@ ation di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m , which is a st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cal ma@@ p that tel@@ ls you something about how re@@ lated the mi@@ c@@ robi@@ al communi@@ ties are in the different sam@@ ples ."
The data poin@@ ts that are clo@@ s@@ er together have mi@@ c@@ robi@@ al communi@@ ties that are more si@@ mi@@ lar than data poin@@ ts that are far a@@ part .
"And the first things that you can see from this gra@@ ph is , if you look at the blue data poin@@ ts , which are the mechani@@ cally v@@ enti@@ lated air , they &apos;re not simply a sub@@ set of the green data poin@@ ts , which are the out@@ door air ."
What we &apos;ve found is that mechani@@ cally v@@ enti@@ lated air looks like hum@@ ans .
"It has micro@@ be@@ s on it that are com@@ mon@@ ly as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with our sk@@ in and with our m@@ outh , our sp@@ it ."
And this is because we &apos;re all con@@ stan@@ tly sh@@ ed@@ ding micro@@ be@@ s .
So all of you right now are sh@@ aring your micro@@ be@@ s with one another .
"And when you &apos;re out@@ do@@ ors , that ty@@ pe of air has micro@@ be@@ s that are com@@ mon@@ ly as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with pl@@ ant lea@@ ves and with di@@ r@@ t ."
Why does this matter ?
It mat@@ ters because the health care indu@@ stry is the second most energy inten@@ sive indu@@ stry in the United States .
H@@ o@@ spi@@ tal@@ s use two and a half times the amount of energy as offi@@ ce buil@@ dings .
"And the model that we &apos;re working with in ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s , and also with many , many different buil@@ dings , is to keep the out@@ do@@ ors out ."
And this model may not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly be the best for our health .
"And given the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary amount of no@@ so@@ com@@ i@@ al in@@ fe@@ ctions , or ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ -@@ ac@@ qui@@ red in@@ fe@@ ctions , this is a clu@@ e that it &apos;s a good time to re@@ consi@@ der our cur@@ r@@ ent prac@@ ti@@ ces ."
"So just as we man@@ age national par@@ ks , where we pro@@ mot@@ e the grow@@ th of some species and we in@@ hi@@ bit the grow@@ th of others , we &apos;re working towar@@ ds thinking about buil@@ dings using an e@@ co@@ system fra@@ me@@ work where we can pro@@ mot@@ e the kinds of micro@@ be@@ s that we want to have in@@ do@@ ors ."
I &apos;ve heard somebody say that you &apos;re as health@@ y as your gu@@ t .
"And for this reason , many people e@@ at pro@@ bi@@ oti@@ c y@@ og@@ ur@@ t so they can pro@@ mot@@ e a health@@ y gu@@ t fl@@ or@@ a ."
And what we ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely want to do is to be able to use this con@@ cept to pro@@ mot@@ e a health@@ y group of micro@@ organi@@ s@@ ms inside .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;d like to start with a shor@@ t story .
It &apos;s about a little bo@@ y wh@@ ose father was a history bu@@ ff and who used to take him by the hand to visi@@ t the ru@@ ins of an an@@ cient me@@ tro@@ pol@@ is on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of their cam@@ p .
"They would always stop by to visi@@ t these huge w@@ ing@@ ed bu@@ l@@ ls that used to gu@@ ard the g@@ ates of that an@@ cient me@@ tro@@ pol@@ is , and the bo@@ y used to be sc@@ ared of these w@@ ing@@ ed bu@@ l@@ ls , but at the same time they exci@@ ted him ."
And the d@@ ad used to use those bu@@ l@@ ls to tell the bo@@ y stories about that ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation and their work .
"L@@ et &apos;s f@@ ast@@ -@@ forward to the S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a many de@@ ca@@ des later , where I started a technology company that brought the world its first 3@@ D las@@ er sc@@ an@@ ning system ."
Let me show you how it works .
F@@ em@@ ale V@@ o@@ ice : L@@ ong r@@ ange las@@ er sc@@ an@@ ning by sen@@ ding out a pul@@ se that &apos;s a las@@ er be@@ am of light .
"The system meas@@ ures the be@@ am &apos;s time of f@@ light , recor@@ ding the time it takes for the light to h@@ it a surface and make its re@@ turn ."
"Wi@@ th two mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r@@ s , the sc@@ an@@ ner cal@@ cu@@ lat@@ es the be@@ am &apos;s h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tal and ver@@ tical ang@@ les , gi@@ ving ac@@ cur@@ ate x , y , and z co@@ ordin@@ ates ."
The point is then recor@@ ded into a 3@@ D vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ ation program .
All of this happens in secon@@ ds .
"B@@ en K@@ ac@@ y@@ ra : You can see here , these systems are extre@@ me@@ ly f@@ ast ."
They colle@@ ct mi@@ llions of poin@@ ts at a time with very high ac@@ cu@@ rac@@ y and very high re@@ solution .
A sur@@ ve@@ y@@ or with tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal sur@@ v@@ ey to@@ ols would be har@@ d-@@ pres@@ sed to produ@@ ce maybe 500 poin@@ ts in a whole day .
These b@@ ab@@ ies would be produ@@ cing something like ten thous@@ and poin@@ ts a second .
"So , as you can imagine , this was a par@@ ad@@ ig@@ m shi@@ ft in the sur@@ v@@ ey and con@@ stru@@ ction as well as in re@@ ality cap@@ ture indu@@ stry ."
"A@@ p@@ pro@@ x@@ im@@ ately ten years ago , my wi@@ fe and I started a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation to do good , and right about that time , the mag@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent B@@ ami@@ y@@ an Bu@@ dd@@ has , hundre@@ d and e@@ igh@@ ty fo@@ ot t@@ all in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , were b@@ low@@ n up by the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an ."
They were gone in an in@@ st@@ ant .
"And un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , there was no de@@ ta@@ i@@ led do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ation of these Bu@@ dd@@ has ."
"This c@@ lear@@ ly de@@ v@@ ast@@ ated me , and I couldn &apos;t help but won@@ der about the f@@ ate of my old friends , the w@@ ing@@ ed bu@@ l@@ ls , and the f@@ ate of the many , many h@@ eri@@ t@@ age si@@ tes all over the world ."
B@@ ot@@ h my wi@@ fe and I were so tou@@ ched by this that we decided to ex@@ p@@ and the mis@@ sion of our f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation to inclu@@ de di@@ gi@@ tal h@@ eri@@ t@@ age pre@@ ser@@ vation of world si@@ tes .
"We called the project C@@ y@@ Ar@@ k , which stan@@ ds for C@@ y@@ ber Ar@@ chi@@ ve ."
"To d@@ ate , with the help of a global network of part@@ n@@ ers , we &apos;ve comple@@ ted close to fi@@ f@@ ty proje@@ cts ."
"L@@ et me show you some of them : Chi@@ ch@@ en I@@ t@@ za , R@@ ap@@ a N@@ u@@ i — and what you &apos;re seeing here are the cl@@ ou@@ d of poin@@ ts — B@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on , R@@ os@@ s@@ ly@@ n C@@ ha@@ pe@@ l , P@@ om@@ pe@@ ii , and our lat@@ est project , M@@ t . R@@ us@@ h@@ more , which happened to be one of our most challen@@ g@@ ing proje@@ cts ."
"As you see here , we had to develo@@ p a spe@@ cial ri@@ g to bring the sc@@ an@@ ner up close and per@@ s@@ onal ."
The resul@@ ts of our work in the fie@@ ld are used to produ@@ ce media and deli@@ ver@@ ab@@ les to be used by con@@ ser@@ v@@ at@@ ors and resear@@ ch@@ ers .
We also produ@@ ce media for dis@@ se@@ min@@ ation to the public — f@@ ree through the C@@ y@@ Ar@@ k we@@ b@@ site .
"These would be used for education , cul@@ tu@@ ral tou@@ ri@@ sm , et@@ c ."
"What you &apos;re looking at in here is a 3@@ D vie@@ wer that we develo@@ ped that would al@@ low the disp@@ l@@ ay and m@@ ani@@ pul@@ ation of &#91; the &#93; cl@@ ou@@ d of poin@@ ts in real time , cu@@ tting se@@ ctions through them and ex@@ trac@@ ting di@@ men@@ sions ."
This happens to be the cl@@ ou@@ d of poin@@ ts for Ti@@ k@@ al .
"In here you see a tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal 2@@ D archite@@ ctu@@ ral engine@@ ering d@@ raw@@ ing that &apos;s used for pre@@ ser@@ vation , and of course we tell the stories through f@@ ly@@ -@@ throu@@ gh@@ s ."
"And here , this is a f@@ ly@@ -@@ through the cl@@ ou@@ d of poin@@ ts of Ti@@ k@@ al , and here you see it ren@@ der@@ ed and ph@@ ot@@ o@@ -@@ te@@ x@@ tu@@ red with the photograph@@ y that we take of the site ."
And so this is not a video .
This is ac@@ tu@@ al 3@@ D poin@@ ts with two to three mi@@ lli@@ me@@ ter ac@@ cu@@ rac@@ y .
And of course the data can be used to develo@@ p 3@@ D mode@@ ls that are very ac@@ cur@@ ate and very de@@ ta@@ i@@ led .
And here you &apos;re looking at a model that &apos;s ex@@ trac@@ ted from the cl@@ ou@@ d of poin@@ ts for S@@ ti@@ r@@ ling C@@ ast@@ le .
"It &apos;s used for stud@@ ies , for vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ ation , as well as for education ."
"And finally , we produ@@ ce mo@@ bi@@ le app@@ s that inclu@@ de nar@@ r@@ ated vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al to@@ ols ."
"The more I got inv@@ olved in the h@@ eri@@ t@@ age fie@@ ld , the more it became clear to me that we are lo@@ sing the si@@ tes and the stories f@@ ast@@ er than we can physi@@ cally pre@@ ser@@ ve them ."
"O@@ f course , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es and all the natural ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a — flo@@ ods , tor@@ na@@ does , et@@ c . — take their t@@ ol@@ l ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , what oc@@ cur@@ red to me was hum@@ an@@ -@@ ca@@ used de@@ stru@@ ction , which was not only ca@@ using a sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant por@@ tion of the de@@ stru@@ ction , but actually it was ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating ."
"This inclu@@ des ar@@ son , urb@@ an spraw@@ l , ac@@ id ra@@ in , not to men@@ tion ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sm and war@@ s ."
It was getting more and more ap@@ par@@ ent that we &apos;re fi@@ gh@@ ting a lo@@ sing bat@@ tle .
"We &apos;re lo@@ sing our si@@ tes and the stories , and basically we &apos;re lo@@ sing a piece — and a sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant piece — of our colle@@ ctive memor@@ y ."
I@@ mag@@ ine us as a human rac@@ e not know@@ ing where we came from .
"Lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly , in the last two or three de@@ ca@@ des , di@@ gi@@ tal technolog@@ ies have been develo@@ ping that have hel@@ ped us to develo@@ p to@@ ols that we &apos;ve brought to be@@ ar in the di@@ gi@@ tal pre@@ ser@@ vation , in our di@@ gi@@ tal pre@@ ser@@ vation war ."
"This inclu@@ des , for example , the 3@@ D las@@ er sc@@ an@@ ning systems , ever more powerful per@@ s@@ onal compu@@ ters , 3@@ D gra@@ phi@@ cs , high-@@ defini@@ tion di@@ gi@@ tal photograph@@ y , not to men@@ tion the Inter@@ net ."
"Because of this ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated p@@ ace of de@@ stru@@ ction , it became clear to us that we needed to challen@@ ge ourselves and our part@@ n@@ ers to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate our work ."
And we created a project we call the C@@ y@@ Ar@@ k 500 Ch@@ al@@ len@@ ge — and that is to di@@ gi@@ t@@ ally pre@@ ser@@ ve 500 World H@@ eri@@ t@@ age S@@ i@@ tes in five years .
"We do have the technology that &apos;s sc@@ ale@@ able , and our network of global part@@ n@@ ers has been ex@@ pan@@ ding and can be ex@@ pan@@ ded at a ra@@ pi@@ d r@@ ate , so we &apos;re comfor@@ table that this t@@ ask can be ac@@ comp@@ li@@ shed ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , to me , the 500 is really just the first 500 ."
"In order to susta@@ in our work into the future , we use technology cen@@ ters where we part@@ ner with local uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties and col@@ leg@@ es to take the technology to them , wh@@ er@@ e@@ by they then can help us with di@@ gi@@ tal pre@@ ser@@ vation of their h@@ eri@@ t@@ age si@@ tes , and at the same time , it gi@@ ves them the technology to b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from in the future ."
Let me close with another shor@@ t story .
"T@@ wo years ago , we were appro@@ ach@@ ed by a part@@ ner of ours to di@@ gi@@ t@@ ally pre@@ ser@@ ve an important h@@ eri@@ t@@ age site , a U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O h@@ eri@@ t@@ age site in U@@ g@@ an@@ da , the Ro@@ y@@ al K@@ as@@ u@@ b@@ i T@@ om@@ b@@ s ."
"The work was done suc@@ cess@@ fully in the fie@@ ld , and the data was archi@@ ved and publi@@ c@@ ly dis@@ se@@ min@@ ated through the C@@ y@@ Ar@@ k we@@ b@@ site ."
"L@@ ast Mar@@ ch , we re@@ cei@@ ved very sa@@ d news ."
The Ro@@ y@@ al T@@ om@@ b@@ s had been de@@ stro@@ yed by s@@ us@@ pe@@ cted ar@@ son .
"A few days later , we re@@ cei@@ ved a call : &quot; &quot; Is the data available and can it be used for re@@ con@@ stru@@ ction ? &quot; &quot; O@@ ur answer , of course , was y@@ es ."
Let me leave you with a fin@@ al thought .
O@@ ur h@@ eri@@ t@@ age is much more than our colle@@ ctive memor@@ y — it &apos;s our colle@@ ctive tre@@ as@@ ure .
"We owe it to our children , our grand@@ children and the gener@@ ations we will never me@@ et to keep it sa@@ fe and to pas@@ s it along ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
"Well , I &apos;m sta@@ ying here because we wanted to de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate to y@@ ou@@ "
"@@ the power of this technology and so , while I &apos;ve been spe@@ aking , you have been sc@@ an@@ ned ."
( Laughter ) The two wi@@ zar@@ ds that I have that are behind the cur@@ tain will help me bring the resul@@ ts on the scre@@ en .
( Applause ) This is all in 3@@ D and of course you can f@@ ly through the cl@@ ou@@ d of poin@@ ts .
"You can look at it from on top , from the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
"You can look from different v@@ an@@ t@@ age poin@@ ts , but I &apos;m going to ask D@@ ou@@ g to z@@ o@@ om in on an individu@@ al in the c@@ row@@ d , just to show the amount of de@@ ta@@ il that we can create ."
So you have been di@@ gi@@ t@@ ally pre@@ ser@@ ved in about four minutes .
( Laughter ) I &apos;d like to th@@ ank the wi@@ zar@@ ds here .
"We were very lu@@ ck@@ y to have two of our part@@ n@@ ers parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in this : the Hi@@ stor@@ ic S@@ c@@ ot@@ land , and the G@@ las@@ go@@ w S@@ cho@@ ol of Ar@@ t ."
"I &apos;d like to also th@@ ank per@@ son@@ ally the ef@@ for@@ ts of Davi@@ d M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell , who is the D@@ i@@ re@@ ctor of Con@@ ser@@ vation at Hi@@ stor@@ ic S@@ c@@ ot@@ land ."
Davi@@ d .
"( Applause ) And D@@ ou@@ g P@@ ri@@ t@@ ch@@ ard , who &apos;s the H@@ e@@ ad of V@@ i@@ su@@ aliz@@ ation at the G@@ las@@ go@@ w S@@ cho@@ ol of Ar@@ t ."
Let &apos;s give them a hand .
( Applause ) Thank you .
"O@@ n@@ ce upo@@ n a time , there was a place called Lest@@ er@@ land ."
Now Lest@@ er@@ land looks a lot like the United States .
"L@@ i@@ ke the United States , it has about 3@@ 11 million people , and of that 3@@ 11 million people , it turns out 1@@ 4@@ 4@@ ,000 are called Lest@@ er ."
"If M@@ at@@ t &apos;s in the audience , I just bor@@ row@@ ed that , I &apos;ll re@@ turn it in a second , this char@@ ac@@ ter from your ser@@ ies ."
"So 1@@ 4@@ 4@@ ,000 are called Lest@@ er , which means about .@@ 0@@ 5 percent is na@@ med Lest@@ er ."
"Now , Lest@@ ers in Lest@@ er@@ land have this ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary power ."
There are two ele@@ ctions every ele@@ ction cy@@ cle in Lest@@ er@@ land .
One is called the gener@@ al ele@@ ction .
The other is called the Lest@@ er ele@@ ction .
"And in the gener@@ al ele@@ ction , it &apos;s the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens who get to v@@ ot@@ e , but in the Lest@@ er ele@@ ction , it &apos;s the Lest@@ ers who get to v@@ ot@@ e ."
And here &apos;s the tri@@ ck .
"In order to run in the gener@@ al ele@@ ction , you must do extre@@ me@@ ly well in the Lest@@ er ele@@ ction ."
"You don &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly have to wi@@ n , but you must do extre@@ me@@ ly well ."
"Now , what can we say about de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y in Lest@@ er@@ land ?"
"What we can say , number one , as the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t said in C@@ i@@ ti@@ z@@ ens United , that people have the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate in@@ flu@@ ence over ele@@ cted offi@@ ci@@ als , because , after all , there is a gener@@ al ele@@ ction , but only after the Lest@@ ers have had their way with the can@@ di@@ d@@ ates who wi@@ sh to run in the gener@@ al ele@@ ction ."
"And number two , obvi@@ ously , this depen@@ dence upo@@ n the Lest@@ ers is going to produ@@ ce a sub@@ tle , under@@ st@@ ated , we could say cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ aged , b@@ ending to keep the Lest@@ ers happy ."
"O@@ kay , so we have a de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y , no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t , but it &apos;s depen@@ dent upo@@ n the Lest@@ ers and depen@@ dent upo@@ n the people ."
"It has compe@@ ting depen@@ den@@ cies , we could say con@@ f@@ lic@@ ting depen@@ den@@ cies , depen@@ ding upo@@ n who the Lest@@ ers are ."
O@@ kay . That &apos;s Lest@@ er@@ land .
Now there are three things I want you to see now that I &apos;ve descri@@ bed Lest@@ er@@ land .
"N@@ um@@ ber one , the United States is Lest@@ er@@ land ."
The United States is Lest@@ er@@ land .
"The United States also looks like this , also has two ele@@ ctions , one we called the gener@@ al ele@@ ction , the second we should call the money ele@@ ction ."
"In the gener@@ al ele@@ ction , it &apos;s the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens who get to v@@ ot@@ e , if you &apos;re over 18 , in some st@@ ates if you have an I@@ D ."
"In the money ele@@ ction , it &apos;s the fun@@ ders who get to v@@ ot@@ e , the fun@@ ders who get to v@@ ot@@ e , and just like in Lest@@ er@@ land , the tri@@ ck is , to run in the gener@@ al ele@@ ction , you must do extre@@ me@@ ly well in the money ele@@ ction ."
You don &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly have to wi@@ n . There is J@@ er@@ ry B@@ row@@ n .
But you must do extre@@ me@@ ly well .
And here &apos;s the key : There are just as few rele@@ v@@ ant fun@@ ders in U@@ S@@ A@@ -@@ land as there are Lest@@ ers in Lest@@ er@@ land .
"Now you say , really ?"
Re@@ ally .@@ 0@@ 5 percent ?
"Well , here are the num@@ bers from 20@@ 10 : .@@ 2@@ 6 percent of America gave 2@@ 00 dollars or more to any fe@@ der@@ al can@@ di@@ d@@ ate , .@@ 0@@ 5 percent gave the ma@@ x@@ i@@ mu@@ m amount to any fe@@ der@@ al can@@ di@@ d@@ ate , .@@ 0@@ 1 percent — the one percent of the one percent — gave 1@@ 0,000 dollars or more to fe@@ der@@ al can@@ di@@ d@@ ates , and in this ele@@ ction cy@@ cle , my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te st@@ ati@@ stic is .@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4@@ 2 percent — for those of you doing the num@@ bers , you know that &apos;s 1@@ 3@@ 2 Ameri@@ cans — gave 60 percent of the Su@@ per P@@ A@@ C money spent in the cy@@ cle we have just seen ending ."
"So I &apos;m just a la@@ wy@@ er , I look at this r@@ ange of num@@ bers , and I say it &apos;s fa@@ ir for me to say it &apos;s .@@ 0@@ 5 percent who are our rele@@ v@@ ant fun@@ ders in America ."
"In this sense , the fun@@ ders are our Lest@@ ers ."
"Now , what can we say about this de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y in U@@ S@@ A@@ -@@ land ?"
"Well , as the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t said in C@@ i@@ ti@@ z@@ ens United , we could say , of course the people have the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate in@@ flu@@ ence over the ele@@ cted offi@@ ci@@ als . We have a gener@@ al ele@@ ction , but only after the fun@@ ders have had their way with the can@@ di@@ d@@ ates who wi@@ sh to run in that gener@@ al ele@@ ction ."
"And number two , obvi@@ ously , this depen@@ dence upo@@ n the fun@@ ders produ@@ ces a sub@@ tle , under@@ st@@ ated , cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ aged b@@ ending to keep the fun@@ ders happy ."
"C@@ an@@ di@@ d@@ ates for Con@@ gre@@ ss and mem@@ bers of Con@@ gre@@ ss spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time ra@@ is@@ ing money to get back to Con@@ gre@@ ss or to get their par@@ ty back into power , and the question we need to ask is , what does it do to them , these hum@@ ans , as they spend their time behind the tele@@ phone , cal@@ ling people they &apos;ve never met , but cal@@ ling the t@@ in@@ ie@@ st sli@@ ce of the one percent ?"
"As any@@ one would , as they do this , they develo@@ p a si@@ x@@ th sense , a con@@ st@@ ant aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess about how what they do might af@@ fe@@ ct their ability to ra@@ ise money ."
"They become , in the words of &quot; &quot; The X@@ -@@ F@@ i@@ les , &quot; &quot; sha@@ pe@@ -@@ shi@@ f@@ ters , as they con@@ stan@@ tly ad@@ just their vie@@ ws in light of what they know will help them to ra@@ ise money , not on issu@@ es one to 10 , but on issu@@ es 11 to 1@@ ,000 ."
"L@@ es@@ lie By@@ r@@ ne , a De@@ moc@@ r@@ at from V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , descri@@ be@@ s that when she went to Con@@ gre@@ ss , she was told by a colle@@ ag@@ ue , &quot; &quot; Al@@ ways le@@ an to the green . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en to c@@ lar@@ i@@ fy , she went on , &quot; &quot; He was not an environ@@ ment@@ ali@@ st . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So here too we have a de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y , a de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y depen@@ dent upo@@ n the fun@@ ders and depen@@ dent upo@@ n the people , compe@@ ting depen@@ den@@ cies , possi@@ bly con@@ f@@ lic@@ ting depen@@ den@@ cies depen@@ ding upo@@ n who the fun@@ ders are ."
"O@@ kay , the United States is Lest@@ er@@ land , point number one ."
Here &apos;s point number two .
"The United States is wor@@ se than Lest@@ er@@ land , wor@@ se than Lest@@ er@@ land because you can imagine in Lest@@ er@@ land if we Lest@@ ers got a let@@ ter from the government that said , &quot; H@@ ey , you get to pi@@ ck who gets to run in the gener@@ al ele@@ ction , &quot; we would think maybe of a kind of ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ rac@@ y of Lest@@ ers ."
"You know , there are Lest@@ ers from every part of social society ."
"There are ri@@ ch Lest@@ ers , po@@ or Lest@@ ers , black Lest@@ ers , white Lest@@ ers , not many women Lest@@ ers , but put that to the side for one second ."
"We have Lest@@ ers from every@@ where . We could think , &quot; What could we do to make Lest@@ er@@ land better ? &quot;"
It &apos;s at least possible the Lest@@ ers would act for the good of Lest@@ er@@ land .
"But in our land , in this land , in U@@ S@@ A@@ -@@ land , there are cer@@ tain@@ ly some s@@ we@@ et Lest@@ ers out there , many of them in this room here today , but the v@@ ast maj@@ ori@@ ty of Lest@@ ers act for the Lest@@ ers , because the shi@@ f@@ ting co@@ ali@@ tions that are comp@@ ri@@ sing the .@@ 0@@ 5 percent are not comp@@ ri@@ sing it for the public inter@@ est ."
"It &apos;s for their pri@@ v@@ ate inter@@ est . In this sense , the USA is wor@@ se than Lest@@ er@@ land ."
"And finally , point number three : Wh@@ atever one wan@@ ts to say about Lest@@ er@@ land , against the back@@ ground of its history , its tra@@ di@@ tions , in our land , in U@@ S@@ A@@ -@@ land , Lest@@ er@@ land is a cor@@ ru@@ ption , a cor@@ ru@@ ption ."
"Now , by cor@@ ru@@ ption I don &apos;t mean b@@ row@@ n pa@@ per ba@@ g c@@ as@@ h se@@ cre@@ ted am@@ ong mem@@ bers of Con@@ gre@@ ss ."
I don &apos;t mean R@@ od B@@ la@@ go@@ je@@ v@@ ich sense of cor@@ ru@@ ption .
I don &apos;t mean any cri@@ min@@ al act .
The cor@@ ru@@ ption I &apos;m talking about is perfe@@ ct@@ ly leg@@ al .
It &apos;s a cor@@ ru@@ ption rel@@ ative to the fra@@ m@@ ers &apos; bas@@ el@@ ine for this re@@ public .
"The fra@@ m@@ ers gave us what they called a re@@ public , but by a re@@ public they me@@ ant a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y , and by a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y , they me@@ ant a government , as M@@ ad@@ is@@ on put it in F@@ e@@ der@@ ali@@ st 5@@ 2 , that would have a bran@@ ch that would be depen@@ dent upo@@ n the people alone ."
So here &apos;s the model of government .
"They have the people and the government with this ex@@ clu@@ sive depen@@ den@@ cy , but the problem here is that Con@@ gre@@ ss has ev@@ olved a different depen@@ dence , no longer a depen@@ dence upo@@ n the people alone , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly a depen@@ dence upo@@ n the fun@@ ders ."
"Now this is a depen@@ dence too , but it &apos;s different and con@@ f@@ lic@@ ting from a depen@@ dence upo@@ n the people alone so long as the fun@@ ders are not the people ."
This is a cor@@ ru@@ ption .
"Now , there &apos;s good news and bad news about this cor@@ ru@@ ption ."
"One bit of good news is that it &apos;s bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an , equ@@ al@@ -@@ opportunity cor@@ ru@@ ption ."
It blo@@ cks the left on a whole r@@ ange of issu@@ es that we on the left really care about .
"It blo@@ cks the right too , as it makes prin@@ ci@@ p@@ led ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents of the right incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly im@@ possible ."
So the right wan@@ ts s@@ mal@@ ler government .
"When A@@ l G@@ ore was V@@ ice P@@ resi@@ dent , his team had an idea for der@@ e@@ gu@@ lat@@ ing a sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant por@@ tion of the tele@@ communi@@ c@@ ations indu@@ stry ."
"The ch@@ ie@@ f poli@@ cy man took this idea to C@@ a@@ pi@@ to@@ l Hi@@ ll , and as he re@@ por@@ ted back to me , the respon@@ se was , &quot; &quot; H@@ ell no !"
"If we der@@ e@@ gu@@ l@@ ate these guys , how are we going to ra@@ ise money from them ? &quot; &quot; This is a system that &apos;s desig@@ ned to sa@@ ve the stat@@ us qu@@ o , inclu@@ ding the stat@@ us qu@@ o of big and inv@@ a@@ sive government ."
"It works against the left and the right , and that , you might say , is good news ."
But here &apos;s the bad news .
"It &apos;s a pa@@ th@@ ologi@@ cal , de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y@@ -@@ de@@ stro@@ ying cor@@ ru@@ ption , because in any system where the mem@@ bers are depen@@ dent upo@@ n the t@@ in@@ ie@@ st f@@ rac@@ tion of us for their ele@@ ction , that means the t@@ in@@ ie@@ st number of us , the t@@ in@@ ie@@ st , t@@ in@@ ie@@ st number of us , can blo@@ ck re@@ form ."
"I know that should have been , like , a ro@@ ck or something ."
I can only find che@@ ese . I &apos;m sor@@ ry . So there it is .
B@@ lo@@ ck re@@ form .
"Because there is an econom@@ y here , an econom@@ y of in@@ flu@@ ence , an econom@@ y with lob@@ by@@ ist@@ s at the cen@@ ter which fe@@ eds on po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ ation ."
It fe@@ eds on dy@@ s@@ fun@@ ction .
"The wor@@ se that it is for us , the better that it is for this fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing ."
H@@ en@@ ry Davi@@ d Th@@ ore@@ a@@ u : &quot; &quot; There are a thous@@ and h@@ ac@@ king at the bran@@ ch@@ es of evi@@ l to one who is stri@@ king at the ro@@ ot . &quot; &quot; This is the ro@@ ot .
"O@@ kay , now , every single one of you know@@ s this ."
"You couldn &apos;t be here if you didn &apos;t know this , yet you ig@@ nor@@ e it ."
You ig@@ nor@@ e it . This is an im@@ possible problem .
"You fo@@ cus on the possible problems , like er@@ ad@@ i@@ c@@ ating poli@@ o from the world , or taking an image of every single stre@@ et across the g@@ lo@@ be , or building the first real uni@@ vers@@ al trans@@ lat@@ or , or building a fu@@ sion fac@@ t@@ ory in your gar@@ age ."
"These are the man@@ ag@@ e@@ able problems , so you ig@@ nor@@ e — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) — so you ig@@ nor@@ e this cor@@ ru@@ ption ."
But we cannot ig@@ nor@@ e this cor@@ ru@@ ption any@@ more .
( Applause ) We need a government that works .
"And not works for the left or the right , but works for the left and the right , the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens of the left and right , because there is no sen@@ si@@ ble re@@ form possible until we end this cor@@ ru@@ ption ."
"So I want you to take h@@ old , to gra@@ b the issue you care the most about ."
"C@@ lim@@ ate change is m@@ ine , but it might be fin@@ an@@ cial re@@ form or a sim@@ ple@@ r ta@@ x system or in@@ equ@@ ality ."
"G@@ ra@@ b that issue , si@@ t it down in front of you , look stra@@ ight in its eyes , and tell it there is no Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as this year ."
There will never be a Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as .
We will never get your issue sol@@ ved until we fi@@ x this issue first .
So it &apos;s not that m@@ ine is the most important issue . It &apos;s not .
"@@ Y@@ ours is the most important issue , but m@@ ine is the first issue , the issue we have to sol@@ ve before we get to fi@@ x the issu@@ es you care about ."
"No sen@@ si@@ ble re@@ form , and we cannot af@@ for@@ d a world , a future , with no sen@@ si@@ ble re@@ form ."
O@@ kay . So how do we do it ?
"T@@ ur@@ ns out , the an@@ al@@ y@@ ti@@ cs here are e@@ asy , simple ."
"If the problem is mem@@ bers sp@@ ending an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary amount of time fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing from the t@@ in@@ ie@@ st sli@@ ce of America , the solution is to have them spend less time fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing but fun@@ dra@@ ise from a wi@@ der sli@@ ce of Ameri@@ cans , to sp@@ read it out , to sp@@ read the fun@@ der in@@ flu@@ ence so that we re@@ stor@@ e the idea of depen@@ dence upo@@ n the people alone ."
"And to do this does not requi@@ re a con@@ stitu@@ ti@@ onal am@@ en@@ d@@ ment , chang@@ ing the F@@ ir@@ st Am@@ en@@ d@@ ment ."
"To do this would requi@@ re a single stat@@ u@@ te , a stat@@ u@@ te est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing what we think of as small dol@@ lar fun@@ ded ele@@ ctions , a stat@@ u@@ te of ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ -@@ fun@@ ded cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ns , and there &apos;s any number of these pro@@ pos@@ als out there : F@@ air E@@ le@@ ctions Now A@@ ct , the American An@@ ti@@ -@@ C@@ or@@ ru@@ ption A@@ ct , an idea in my book that I call the G@@ r@@ ant and Fran@@ kli@@ n Pro@@ je@@ ct to give v@@ ou@@ ch@@ ers to people to fu@@ nd ele@@ ctions , an idea of Joh@@ n S@@ ar@@ ban@@ es called the G@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ots De@@ moc@@ rac@@ y A@@ ct ."
E@@ ach of these would fi@@ x this cor@@ ru@@ ption by sp@@ re@@ ading out the in@@ flu@@ ence of fun@@ ders to all of us .
The an@@ al@@ y@@ ti@@ cs are e@@ asy here .
"It &apos;s the poli@@ ti@@ cs that &apos;s hard , in@@ de@@ ed im@@ possi@@ bly hard , because this re@@ form would sh@@ r@@ in@@ k K St@@ re@@ et , and C@@ a@@ pi@@ to@@ l Hi@@ ll , as Con@@ gre@@ s@@ s@@ man J@@ im Co@@ op@@ er , a De@@ moc@@ r@@ at from T@@ en@@ n@@ es@@ see , put it , has become a far@@ m le@@ ag@@ ue for K St@@ re@@ et , a far@@ m le@@ ag@@ ue for K St@@ re@@ et ."
"M@@ em@@ bers and st@@ af@@ f@@ ers and bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ rat@@ s have an incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly common business model in their head , a business model fo@@ c@@ used on their life after government , their life as lob@@ by@@ ist@@ s ."
"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty percent of the S@@ en@@ ate between 199@@ 8 and 200@@ 4 left to become lob@@ by@@ ist@@ s , 4@@ 2 percent of the H@@ ou@@ se ."
"Th@@ ose num@@ bers have only gone up , and as United Re@@ public cal@@ cu@@ lated last Ap@@ ri@@ l , the a@@ ver@@ age incre@@ ase in s@@ al@@ ary for those who they trac@@ ked was 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 5@@ 2 percent ."
"So it &apos;s fa@@ ir to ask , how is it possible for them to change this ?"
Now I get this sk@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ ci@@ sm .
I get this cy@@ ni@@ ci@@ sm . I get this sense of im@@ possi@@ bility .
But I don &apos;t bu@@ y it .
This is a sol@@ v@@ able issue .
"If you think about the issu@@ es our parents tr@@ ied to sol@@ ve in the 20@@ th century , issu@@ es like rac@@ is@@ m , or se@@ x@@ is@@ m , or the issue that we &apos;ve been fi@@ gh@@ ting in this century , hom@@ op@@ h@@ ob@@ ia , those are hard issu@@ es ."
You don &apos;t wa@@ ke up one day no longer a rac@@ i@@ st .
"It takes gener@@ ations to te@@ ar that in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion , that DNA , out of the s@@ ou@@ l of a people ."
"But this is a problem of just in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves , just in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves ."
"Ch@@ ange the in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves , and the behavi@@ or chang@@ es , and the st@@ ates that have ad@@ op@@ ted small dol@@ lar fun@@ ded systems have seen over@@ night a change in the prac@@ ti@@ ce ."
"When Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ cut ad@@ op@@ ted this system , in the very first year , 7@@ 8 percent of ele@@ cted re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ati@@ ves gave up large con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions and took small con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions only ."
"It &apos;s sol@@ v@@ able , not by being a De@@ moc@@ r@@ at , not by being a Re@@ publi@@ can ."
"It &apos;s sol@@ v@@ able by being ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , by being ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , by being TE@@ D@@ i@@ z@@ ens ."
"Because if you want to ki@@ ck@@ start re@@ form , look , I could ki@@ ck@@ start re@@ form at half the pri@@ ce of fi@@ x@@ ing energy poli@@ cy , I could give you back a re@@ public ."
"O@@ kay . But even if you &apos;re not yet with me , even if you believe this is im@@ possible , what the five years since I spo@@ ke at TED has t@@ au@@ ght me as I &apos;ve spo@@ k@@ en about this issue again and again is , even if you think it &apos;s im@@ possible , that is ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant ."
I@@ r@@ rele@@ v@@ ant .
"I spo@@ ke at D@@ ar@@ t@@ m@@ outh once , and a woman sto@@ od up after I spo@@ ke , I write in my book , and she said to me , &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or , you &apos;ve con@@ v@@ in@@ ced me this is hop@@ el@@ ess . H@@ op@@ el@@ ess ."
"There &apos;s nothing we can do . &quot; &quot; When she said that , I sc@@ ra@@ m@@ b@@ led ."
"I tr@@ ied to think , &quot; &quot; How do I re@@ spo@@ nd to that hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness ?"
What is that sense of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness ? &quot; &quot; And what h@@ it me was an image of my si@@ x@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old son .
"And I imag@@ ined a do@@ ctor coming to me and saying , &quot; &quot; Y@@ our son has ter@@ min@@ al brain can@@ cer , and there &apos;s nothing you can do ."
N@@ o@@ thing you can do . &quot; &quot; So would I do nothing ?
"W@@ ould I just si@@ t there ? A@@ c@@ cept it ? O@@ kay , nothing I can do ?"
I &apos;m going off to build Go@@ og@@ le G@@ las@@ s .
"O@@ f course not . I would do everything I could , and I would do everything I could because this is what love means , that the od@@ ds are ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant and that you do whatever the he@@ ll you can , the od@@ ds be dam@@ ned ."
"And then I saw the obvi@@ ous lin@@ k , because even we li@@ ber@@ als love this country ."
"( Laughter ) And so when the pun@@ di@@ ts and the poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans say that change is im@@ possible , what this love of country says back is , &quot; That &apos;s just ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant . &quot;"
"We lo@@ se something de@@ ar , something everyone in this room lo@@ ves and ch@@ eri@@ sh@@ es , if we lo@@ se this re@@ public , and so we act with everything we can to pro@@ ve these pun@@ di@@ ts wrong ."
So here &apos;s my question : Do you have that love ? Do you have that love ?
"Because if you do ,"
"@@ then what the he@@ ll are you , what are the he@@ ll are we doing ?"
"When B@@ en Fran@@ kli@@ n was car@@ ried from the con@@ stitu@@ ti@@ onal con@@ ven@@ tion in Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber of 1@@ 7@@ 8@@ 7 , he was stop@@ ped in the stre@@ et by a woman who said , &quot; M@@ r. Fran@@ kli@@ n , what have you w@@ rought ? &quot;"
"F@@ ran@@ kli@@ n said , &quot; &quot; A re@@ public , m@@ ad@@ am , if you can keep it . &quot; &quot; A re@@ public . A re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y ."
A government depen@@ dent upo@@ n the people alone .
We have lost that re@@ public .
All of us have to act to get it back .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
"To most of you , this is a de@@ vice to bu@@ y , se@@ ll , play g@@ am@@ es , wat@@ ch vi@@ de@@ os ."
I think it might be a li@@ fel@@ ine .

I can help you with those later .

And this isn &apos;t some su@@ bur@@ b@@ an i@@ P@@ h@@ one@@ -@@ using te@@ en ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
T@@ ex@@ ting actually over@@ in@@ de@@ x@@ es for min@@ ori@@ ty and urb@@ an y@@ outh .
"I know this because at D@@ o@@ S@@ ome@@ thin@@ g@@ .@@ or@@ g , which is the largest organiz@@ ation for te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers and social change in America , about six months ago we pi@@ v@@ ot@@ ed and started fo@@ c@@ using on te@@ xt mess@@ ag@@ ing ."
"We &apos;re now te@@ x@@ ting out to about 200@@ ,000 kids a week about doing our cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ns to make their scho@@ ols more green or to work on hom@@ el@@ ess issu@@ es and things like that ."
We &apos;re fin@@ ding it 11 times more powerful than e@@ ma@@ il .
We &apos;ve also found an un@@ inten@@ ded con@@ sequ@@ ence .
We &apos;ve been getting te@@ xt mess@@ ages back like these .
&quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to school today .
"The bo@@ ys call me f@@ ag@@ got . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was cu@@ tting , my parents found out , and so I stop@@ ped ."
"But I just started again an hour ago . &quot; &quot; O@@ r , &quot; &quot; He won &apos;t stop ra@@ ping me ."
He told me not to tell any@@ one .
It &apos;s my d@@ ad . A@@ re you there ? &quot; &quot; That last one &apos;s an ac@@ tu@@ al te@@ xt mess@@ age that we re@@ cei@@ ved .
"And ye@@ ah , we &apos;re there ."
I will not for@@ get the day we got that te@@ xt mess@@ age .
And so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a cri@@ sis te@@ xt hot@@ line .
Because this isn &apos;t what we do .
We do social change .
K@@ i@@ ds are just sen@@ ding us these te@@ xt mess@@ ages because te@@ x@@ ting is so fami@@ li@@ ar and comfor@@ table to them and there &apos;s now@@ here else to turn that they &apos;re sen@@ ding them to us .
"So think about it , a te@@ xt hot@@ line ; it &apos;s pretty powerful ."
"It &apos;s f@@ ast , it &apos;s pretty pri@@ v@@ ate ."
"No one hear@@ s you in a st@@ all , you &apos;re just te@@ x@@ ting qu@@ ie@@ tly ."
It &apos;s real time .
We can help mi@@ llions of te@@ ens with coun@@ sel@@ ing and re@@ fer@@ r@@ als .
That &apos;s great .
But the thing that really makes this aw@@ es@@ ome is the data .
Because I &apos;m not really comfor@@ table just hel@@ ping that girl with coun@@ sel@@ ing and re@@ fer@@ r@@ als .
I want to pre@@ v@@ ent this sh@@ it from happening .
So think about a co@@ p .
There &apos;s something in New York C@@ ity .
"The poli@@ ce did it . It used to be just gu@@ ess work , poli@@ ce work ."
And then they started cri@@ me ma@@ pping .
"And so they started fol@@ low@@ ing and wat@@ ching pe@@ t@@ ty the@@ f@@ ts , sum@@ mon@@ ses , all kinds of things — char@@ ting the future essen@@ ti@@ ally ."
"And they found things like , when you see c@@ r@@ yst@@ al me@@ th on the stre@@ et , if you ad@@ d poli@@ ce pre@@ sen@@ ce , you can cur@@ b the o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se in@@ evi@@ table sp@@ ate of as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts and rob@@ ber@@ ies that would happen ."
"In fact , the year after the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D put C@@ om@@ p@@ St@@ at in place , the mu@@ r@@ der r@@ ate fe@@ ll 60 percent ."
So think about the data from a cri@@ sis te@@ xt line .
There is no cen@@ su@@ s on bu@@ ll@@ ying and d@@ ating ab@@ use and e@@ ating di@@ sor@@ ders and cu@@ tting and ra@@ pe — no cen@@ su@@ s .
"M@@ a@@ ybe there &apos;s some stud@@ ies , some lon@@ gi@@ tu@@ din@@ al stud@@ ies , that cost lots of money and took lots of time ."
O@@ r maybe there &apos;s some an@@ e@@ c@@ dot@@ al evi@@ dence .
I@@ mag@@ ine having real time data on every one of those issu@@ es .
You could in@@ form le@@ gi@@ sl@@ ation .
You could in@@ form school poli@@ cy .
"You could say to a prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re having a problem every Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day at three o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck ."
What &apos;s going on in your school ? &quot; &quot; You could see the im@@ medi@@ ate impac@@ t of le@@ gi@@ sl@@ ation or a h@@ ate@@ ful spe@@ e@@ ch that somebody gi@@ ves in a school as@@ se@@ m@@ bly and see what happens as a resul@@ t .
"This is really , to me , the power of te@@ x@@ ting and the power of data ."
"Because while people are talking about data , making it possible for F@@ ace@@ book to m@@ ine my friend from the third gra@@ de , or T@@ ar@@ get to know when it &apos;s time for me to bu@@ y more di@@ a@@ per@@ s , or some du@@ de to build a better bas@@ e@@ ball team , I &apos;m actually really exci@@ ted about the power of data and the power of te@@ x@@ ting to help that kid go to school , to help that girl stop cu@@ tting in the ba@@ th@@ room and absolu@@ tely to help that girl wh@@ ose father &apos;s ra@@ ping her ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So re@@ cent@@ ly , some white guys and some black women s@@ wa@@ pped T@@ wit@@ ter av@@ at@@ ars , or pi@@ ctures on@@ line ."
"They didn &apos;t change their cont@@ ent , they ke@@ pt t@@ wee@@ ting the same as usu@@ al , but sud@@ den@@ ly , the white guys noti@@ ced they were getting called the n@@ -@@ word all the time and they were getting the wor@@ st kind of on@@ line ab@@ use , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the black women all of a sud@@ den noti@@ ced things got a lot more ple@@ as@@ ant for them ."
"Now , if you &apos;re my fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old , your Inter@@ net consi@@ sts mo@@ st@@ ly of pu@@ p@@ pie@@ s and fa@@ ir@@ ies and oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally fa@@ ir@@ ies ri@@ ding pu@@ p@@ pie@@ s ."
That &apos;s a thing . Go@@ og@@ le it .
But the rest of us know that the Inter@@ net can be a really u@@ g@@ ly place .
I &apos;m talking about na@@ sty per@@ s@@ onal att@@ ac@@ ks .
"M@@ a@@ ybe it &apos;s happened to you , but it &apos;s at least t@@ wi@@ ce as li@@ ke@@ ly to happen , and be wor@@ se , if you &apos;re a woman , a person of color , or g@@ ay , or more than one at the same time ."
"In fact , just as I was writing this talk , I found a T@@ wit@@ ter ac@@ coun@@ t called @ S@@ al@@ ly@@ Ko@@ h@@ n@@ Su@@ cks ."
"The bi@@ o says that I &apos;m a &quot; &quot; man@@ -@@ h@@ ater and a bu@@ ll dy@@ ke and the only thing I &apos;ve ever ac@@ comp@@ li@@ shed with my car@@ e@@ er is sp@@ re@@ ading my per@@ verse se@@ x@@ u@@ ality . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ich , in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , is only a third cor@@ re@@ ct ."
"I mean , l@@ ies ! ( Laughter ) But seri@@ ously , we all say we h@@ ate this c@@ ra@@ p ."
The question is whether you &apos;re wil@@ ling to make a per@@ s@@ onal s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce to change it .
I don &apos;t mean gi@@ ving up the Inter@@ net .
"I mean chang@@ ing the way you cli@@ ck , because c@@ lic@@ king is a public act ."
It &apos;s no longer the case that a few powerful e@@ li@@ tes control all the media and the rest of us are just pas@@ sive re@@ cei@@ ver@@ s .
"In@@ cre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly , we &apos;re all the media ."
"I used to think , oh , o@@ kay , I get dre@@ s@@ sed up , I put on a lot of mak@@ e@@ up , I go on tele@@ vision , I talk about the news ."
That is a public act of making media .
"And then I go home and I b@@ row@@ se the we@@ b and I &apos;m re@@ ading T@@ wit@@ ter , and that &apos;s a pri@@ v@@ ate act of con@@ sum@@ ing media ."
"I mean , of course it is . I &apos;m in my p@@ aj@@ am@@ as ."
W@@ rong .
"E@@ very@@ thing we blo@@ g , everything we T@@ we@@ et , and everything we cli@@ ck is a public act of making media ."
We are the new e@@ di@@ t@@ ors .
We deci@@ de what gets at@@ ten@@ tion based on what we give our at@@ ten@@ tion to .
That &apos;s how the media works now .
"There &apos;s all these hi@@ d@@ den al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms that deci@@ de what you see more of and what we all see more of based on what you cli@@ ck on , and that in turn sha@@ p@@ es our whole culture ."
"In an incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly no@@ is@@ y media land@@ s@@ cape , the in@@ cen@@ tive is to make more no@@ ise to be heard , and that ty@@ ran@@ ny of the l@@ ou@@ d en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ges the ty@@ ran@@ ny of the na@@ sty ."
It does not have to be that way .
It does not .
We can change the in@@ cen@@ tive .
"F@@ ir@@ st , don &apos;t just stand by the si@@ de@@ lin@@ es when you see someone getting h@@ ur@@ t ."
"If someone is being ab@@ used on@@ line , do something ."
B@@ e a her@@ o . This is your ch@@ ance .
S@@ pe@@ ak up . S@@ pe@@ ak out . B@@ e a good person .
D@@ row@@ n out the neg@@ ative with the posi@@ tive .
"I know you do it . ( Applause ) You too , ap@@ par@@ ently ."
"I mean , really , same example : if you don &apos;t like poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans cal@@ ling each other na@@ mes , stop c@@ lic@@ king on the stories about what one guy in one par@@ ty called the other guy in the other par@@ ty ."
C@@ lic@@ king on a tra@@ in w@@ re@@ ck just po@@ ur@@ s g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine on it .
"It makes it wor@@ se , the fi@@ re sp@@ re@@ ads ."
O@@ ur whole culture gets bur@@ ned .
"If what gets the most c@@ lic@@ ks win@@ s , then we have to start sha@@ ping the world we want with our c@@ lic@@ ks , because c@@ lic@@ king is a public act ."
So cli@@ ck respon@@ si@@ bly . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to show you how something you can &apos;t see can be so much fun to look at .
"You &apos;re about to experience a new , available and exci@@ ting technology that &apos;s going to make us re@@ think how we wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of our lives ."
What I have here is a cin@@ der blo@@ ck that we &apos;ve co@@ ated half with a n@@ an@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy spra@@ y that can be ap@@ pl@@ ied to almost any materi@@ al .
"It &apos;s called U@@ l@@ tra@@ -@@ E@@ ver D@@ ry , and when you app@@ ly it to any materi@@ al , it turns into a super@@ hy@@ dro@@ ph@@ ob@@ ic sh@@ ie@@ ld ."
"So this is a cin@@ der blo@@ ck , un@@ co@@ ated , and you can see that it &apos;s po@@ rou@@ s , it ab@@ sor@@ b@@ s water ."
N@@ ot any@@ more .
"Po@@ rou@@ s , n@@ on@@ po@@ rou@@ s ."
So what &apos;s super@@ hy@@ dro@@ ph@@ ob@@ ic ?
Su@@ per@@ hy@@ dro@@ ph@@ ob@@ ic is how we meas@@ ure a dro@@ p of water on a surface .
"The ro@@ under it is , the more hy@@ dro@@ ph@@ ob@@ ic it is , and if it &apos;s really round , it &apos;s super@@ hy@@ dro@@ ph@@ ob@@ ic ."
"A fre@@ sh@@ ly wa@@ x@@ ed car , the water mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les s@@ lu@@ m@@ p to about 90 de@@ gre@@ es ."
A win@@ d@@ sh@@ ie@@ ld co@@ ating is going to give you about 1@@ 10 de@@ gre@@ es .
"But what you &apos;re seeing here is 1@@ 60 to 1@@ 7@@ 5 de@@ gre@@ es , and anything over 1@@ 50 is super@@ hy@@ dro@@ ph@@ ob@@ ic ."
"So as part of the de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation , what I have is a pa@@ ir of g@@ lo@@ ves , and we &apos;ve co@@ ated one of the g@@ lo@@ ves with the n@@ an@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy co@@ ating , and let &apos;s see if you can tell which one , and I &apos;ll give you a h@@ int ."
D@@ id you gu@@ ess the one that was d@@ ry ?
"When you have n@@ an@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy and n@@ an@@ os@@ cien@@ ce , what &apos;s oc@@ cur@@ red is that we &apos;re able to now look at at@@ oms and mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les and actually control them for great b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts ."
And we &apos;re talking really small here .
"The way you meas@@ ure n@@ an@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy is in n@@ an@@ ome@@ ters , and one n@@ an@@ ome@@ ter is a bi@@ lli@@ on@@ th of a me@@ ter , and to put some scale to that , if you had a n@@ an@@ op@@ arti@@ cle that was one n@@ an@@ ome@@ ter thi@@ ck , and you put it side by side , and you had 5@@ 0,000 of them , you &apos;d be the wi@@ d@@ th of a human ha@@ ir ."
"So very small , but very us@@ e@@ ful ."
And it &apos;s not just water that this works with .
"It &apos;s a lot of wat@@ er@@ -@@ based materi@@ als like con@@ cre@@ te , wat@@ er@@ -@@ based pa@@ int , mu@@ d , and also some re@@ fin@@ ed o@@ il@@ s as well ."
You can see the difference .
"Mo@@ ving on@@ to the next de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation , we &apos;ve taken a p@@ ane of gl@@ as@@ s and we &apos;ve co@@ ated the outside of it , we &apos;ve fra@@ med it with the n@@ an@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy co@@ ating , and we &apos;re going to po@@ ur this gre@@ en@@ -@@ t@@ in@@ ted water inside the mi@@ ddle , and you &apos;re going to see , it &apos;s going to sp@@ read out on gl@@ as@@ s like you &apos;d nor@@ m@@ ally think it would , ex@@ cept when it hi@@ ts the co@@ ating , it stop@@ s , and I can &apos;t even co@@ a@@ x it to leave ."
It &apos;s that af@@ ra@@ id of the water .
( Applause ) So what &apos;s going on here ? What &apos;s happening ?
"Well , the surface of the spra@@ y co@@ ating is actually fil@@ led with n@@ an@@ op@@ arti@@ cles that form a very rou@@ gh and c@@ ra@@ gg@@ ly surface ."
"You &apos;d think it &apos;d be smo@@ ot@@ h , but it &apos;s actually not ."
"And it has bi@@ llions of inter@@ sti@@ tial sp@@ ac@@ es , and those sp@@ ac@@ es , along with the n@@ an@@ op@@ arti@@ cles , re@@ ach up and gra@@ b the air mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les , and co@@ ver the surface with air ."
"It &apos;s an um@@ b@@ rel@@ la of air all across it , and that la@@ y@@ er of air is what the water hi@@ ts , the mu@@ d hi@@ ts , the con@@ cre@@ te hi@@ ts , and it g@@ li@@ des right off ."
"So if I put this inside this water here , you can see a sil@@ ver ref@@ le@@ ctive co@@ ating around it , and that sil@@ ver ref@@ le@@ ctive co@@ ating is the la@@ y@@ er of air that &apos;s prote@@ cting the water from tou@@ ching the pad@@ d@@ le , and it &apos;s d@@ ry ."
So what are the app@@ lic@@ ations ?
"I mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head ."
"E@@ very@@ one that se@@ es this gets exci@@ ted , and says , &quot; Oh , I could use it for this and this and this . &quot;"
The app@@ lic@@ ations in a gener@@ al sense could be anything that &apos;s anti@@ -@@ we@@ tting .
We &apos;ve cer@@ tain@@ ly seen that today .
"It could be anything that &apos;s anti@@ -@@ i@@ cing , because if you don &apos;t have water , you don &apos;t have ice ."
It could be anti@@ -@@ cor@@ ro@@ sion .
"No water , no cor@@ ro@@ sion ."
It could be anti@@ -@@ bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al .
"Wi@@ th@@ out water , the bac@@ ter@@ ia won &apos;t survi@@ ve ."
And it could be things that need to be self-@@ cle@@ an@@ ing as well .
So imagine how something like this could help re@@ v@@ olu@@ ti@@ oni@@ ze your fie@@ ld of work .
"And I &apos;m going to leave you with one last de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation , but before I do that , I would like to say th@@ ank you , and think small ."
( Applause ) It &apos;s going to happen . W@@ a@@ it for it . W@@ a@@ it for it .
Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : You guys didn &apos;t hear about us cu@@ tting out the De@@ sig@@ n from TED ? ( Laughter ) &#91; T@@ wo minutes later ... &#93; He ran into all sor@@ ts of problems in terms of man@@ ag@@ ing the medi@@ cal research part .
It &apos;s happening !
( Applause )
"In this rather long sort of mar@@ a@@ th@@ on pres@@ ent@@ ation , I &apos;ve tr@@ ied to bre@@ ak it up into three par@@ ts : the first being a whole lot of exam@@ ples on how it can be a little bit more ple@@ as@@ u@@ ra@@ ble to deal with a computer and really ad@@ dre@@ ss the qu@@ ali@@ ties of the human inter@@ face ."
"And these will be some simple design qu@@ ali@@ ties and they will also be some qu@@ ali@@ ties of , if you will , the inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence of inter@@ action ."
Th@@ en the second part will really just be exam@@ ples of new technolog@@ ies — new media fal@@ ling very much into that mo@@ ld .
"A@@ ga@@ in , I will go through them as f@@ ast as possible ."
"And then the last one will be some exam@@ ples I &apos;ve been able to colle@@ ct , which I think il@@ lu@@ str@@ ate this at least as best I can , in the world of en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment ."
"P@@ e@@ ople have this belie@@ f — and I share most of it — that we will be using the T@@ V scre@@ ens or their e@@ qui@@ val@@ ents for ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic boo@@ ks of the future . But then you think , &quot; My God ! What a terri@@ ble image you get when you look at still pi@@ ctures on T@@ V . &quot;"
"Well , it doesn &apos;t have to be terri@@ ble ."
"And that is a sli@@ de taken from a T@@ V set and it was pre@@ -@@ pro@@ cess@@ ed to be very sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic to the T@@ V medi@@ um , and it absolu@@ tely looks beautiful ."
"Well , what &apos;s happened ? How did people get into this m@@ ess ?"
"W@@ here you are now , all of a sud@@ den , sitting in front of per@@ s@@ onal compu@@ ters and video te@@ xt — tele@@ te@@ xt systems , and some@@ what hor@@ ri@@ f@@ ied by what you see on the scre@@ en ?"
"Well , you have to remember that T@@ V was desig@@ ned to be looked at eight times the di@@ stance of the di@@ ag@@ onal ."
"So you get a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ in@@ ch , 19@@ -@@ in@@ ch , whatever , T@@ V , and then you should mul@@ ti@@ ply that by eight and that &apos;s the di@@ stance you should si@@ t away from the T@@ V set ."
"Now we &apos;ve put people 18 in@@ ch@@ es in front of a T@@ V , and all the arti@@ fac@@ ts that n@@ one of the ori@@ gin@@ al desig@@ n@@ ers expe@@ cted to be seen , all of a sud@@ den , are star@@ ing you in the face : the sha@@ do@@ w mas@@ k , the s@@ can lin@@ es , all of that ."
"And they can be tre@@ ated very e@@ a@@ si@@ ly ; there are actually ways of getting ri@@ d of them , there are actually ways of just making absolu@@ tely beautiful pi@@ ctures ."
I &apos;m talking here a little bit about disp@@ l@@ ay technolog@@ ies .
Let me talk about how you might in@@ put information .
And my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te example is always fin@@ g@@ ers .
I &apos;m very interested in tou@@ ch@@ -@@ sen@@ si@@ tive disp@@ la@@ ys .
"H@@ igh@@ -@@ te@@ ch , high-@@ tou@@ ch . I@@ sn &apos;t that what some of you said ?"
"It &apos;s cer@@ tain@@ ly a very important medi@@ um for in@@ put , and a lot of people think that fin@@ g@@ ers are a very low@@ -@@ re@@ solution sort of sty@@ lu@@ s for in@@ pu@@ tting to a disp@@ l@@ ay ."
"In fact , they &apos;re not : it &apos;s really a very , very high-@@ re@@ solution in@@ put medi@@ um — you have to just do it t@@ wi@@ ce , you have to tou@@ ch the scre@@ en and then ro@@ t@@ ate your fin@@ ger sli@@ gh@@ tly — and you can move a cur@@ s@@ or with great ac@@ cu@@ rac@@ y ."
"And so when you see on the market these systems that have just a few light e@@ mi@@ tting di@@ o@@ des on the side and are very low re@@ solution , it &apos;s nice that they exi@@ st because it still is better than nothing ."
"But it , in some sense , mis@@ ses the point : na@@ me@@ ly , that fin@@ g@@ ers are a very , very high-@@ re@@ solution in@@ put medi@@ um ."
"Now , what are some of the other adv@@ an@@ t@@ ages ?"
"Well , the one adv@@ an@@ t@@ age is that you don &apos;t have to pi@@ ck them up , and people don &apos;t realize how important that is — not having to pi@@ ck up your fin@@ g@@ ers to use them . ( Laughter ) When you think for a second of the m@@ ou@@ se on M@@ ac@@ in@@ to@@ sh — and I will not cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze the m@@ ou@@ se too much — when you &apos;re ty@@ ping — what you have — you want to now put something — first of all , you &apos;ve got to find the m@@ ou@@ se ."
"You have to probably stop . Ma@@ ybe not come to a gr@@ in@@ ding hal@@ t , but you &apos;ve got to sort of find that m@@ ou@@ se . Th@@ en you find the m@@ ou@@ se , and you &apos;re going to have to wi@@ gg@@ le it a little bit to see where the cur@@ s@@ or is on the scre@@ en ."
"And then when you finally see where it is , then you &apos;ve got to move it to get the cur@@ s@@ or over there , and then — &quot; &quot; B@@ an@@ g &quot; &quot; — you &apos;ve got to h@@ it a bu@@ t@@ ton or do whatever ."
"That &apos;s four se@@ par@@ ate ste@@ ps ver@@ su@@ s ty@@ ping and then tou@@ ching and ty@@ ping and just doing it all in one moti@@ on — or one@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half , depen@@ ding on how you want to coun@@ t ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , what I &apos;m trying to do is just il@@ lu@@ str@@ ate the kinds of problems that I think face the desig@@ n@@ ers of new computer systems and en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment systems and edu@@ c@@ ational systems from the perspe@@ ctive of the qu@@ ality of that inter@@ face ."
"And another adv@@ an@@ t@@ age , of course , of using fin@@ g@@ ers is you have 10 of them ."
"And we have never known how to do this techni@@ cally , so this sli@@ de is a fak@@ e sli@@ de ."
"We never suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed in using ten fin@@ g@@ ers , but there are certain things you can do , obvi@@ ously , with more than one@@ -@@ fin@@ ger in@@ put , which is rather fas@@ cin@@ ating ."
What we did st@@ um@@ ble across was something ...
"A@@ ga@@ in , which is ty@@ pi@@ cal of the computer fie@@ ld , is when you have a bu@@ g that you can &apos;t get ri@@ d of you turn it into a fe@@ ature ."
And maybe ... ( Laughter ) maybe a m@@ ou@@ se is a new kind of bu@@ g .
"But the bu@@ g in our case was in tou@@ ch@@ -@@ sen@@ si@@ tive disp@@ la@@ ys : we wanted to be able to dra@@ w — you know , ru@@ b your fin@@ ger across the scre@@ en to in@@ put contin@@ u@@ ous poin@@ ts — and there was just too much f@@ ri@@ ction created between your fin@@ ger and the gl@@ as@@ s — if gl@@ as@@ s was the sub@@ str@@ ate , which it usu@@ ally is ."
So we found that that actually was a fe@@ ature in the sense you could build a pres@@ su@@ re@@ -@@ sen@@ si@@ tive disp@@ l@@ ay .
"And when you tou@@ ch it with your fin@@ ger , you can actually , then , in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce all the for@@ ces on the face of that scre@@ en , and that actually has a certain amount of val@@ ue ."
"L@@ et me see if I can lo@@ ad another dis@@ c and show you , quickly , an example ."
"Now , imagine a scre@@ en , which is not only tou@@ ch@@ -@@ sen@@ si@@ tive now , it &apos;s pres@@ su@@ re@@ -@@ sen@@ si@@ tive ."
"And it &apos;s pres@@ su@@ re@@ -@@ sen@@ si@@ tive to the for@@ ces both in the pl@@ ane of the scre@@ en — X , Y , and Z at least in one dire@@ ction ; we couldn &apos;t figure out how to come in the other dire@@ ction ."
"But let me get ri@@ d of the sli@@ de , and let &apos;s see if this comes on ."
OK . So there is the pres@@ su@@ re@@ -@@ sen@@ si@@ tive disp@@ l@@ ay in oper@@ ation .
"The person &apos;s just , if you will , p@@ us@@ h@@ ing on the scre@@ en to make a cur@@ ve ."
But this is the interesting part .
I want to stop it for a second because the movie is very bad@@ ly made .
"And the particular disp@@ l@@ ay was built about six years ago , and when we mo@@ ved from one room to another room , a rather large person s@@ at on it and it got de@@ stro@@ yed ."
"So all we have is this recor@@ d . ( Laughter ) But imagine that scre@@ en having lots of obje@@ cts on it and the person has tou@@ ched an obje@@ ct — one of N — like he did there , and then p@@ us@@ h@@ ed on it ."
"Now , imagine a program where some of those obje@@ cts are physi@@ cally he@@ av@@ y and some are light : one is an an@@ vi@@ l on a fu@@ z@@ zy ru@@ g and the other one is a p@@ ing@@ -@@ pon@@ g ball on a sh@@ e@@ et of gl@@ as@@ s ."
"And when you tou@@ ch it , you have to really p@@ us@@ h very hard to move that an@@ vi@@ l across the scre@@ en , and yet you tou@@ ch the p@@ ing@@ -@@ pon@@ g ball very li@@ gh@@ tly and it just s@@ co@@ ots across the scre@@ en ."
"And what you can do — o@@ op@@ s , I didn &apos;t mean to do that — what you can do is actually fe@@ ed back to the us@@ er the feeling of the physi@@ cal pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"So again , they don &apos;t have to be we@@ ight ; they could be a gener@@ al trying to move tro@@ op@@ s , and he &apos;s got to move an air@@ c@@ ra@@ ft car@@ r@@ ier ver@@ su@@ s a little boat ."
"In fact , they fun@@ ded it for that very reason ."
"( Laughter ) The whole noti@@ on , then , is one that at the inter@@ face there are physi@@ cal pro@@ per@@ ties in that trans@@ du@@ cer — in this case it &apos;s pres@@ sure and tou@@ ch@@ es — that al@@ low you to present things to the us@@ er that you could never present before ."
"So it &apos;s not simply looking at the qu@@ ality or , if you will , the lu@@ x@@ ury of that inter@@ face , but it &apos;s actually looking at the idea of pres@@ ent@@ ing things that pre@@ vi@@ ously couldn &apos;t be pre@@ sen@@ ted before ."
"I want to move on to another example , which is one of a different sort , where we &apos;re trying to use computer and video dis@@ c technology now to come up with a new kind of book ."
"H@@ ere , the idea is that you &apos;re going to take this book , if you will , and it &apos;s going to come ali@@ ve ."
You &apos;re going to sort of bre@@ a@@ the life into it .
We are so used to doing mon@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ es .
"F@@ il@@ m@@ mak@@ ers , for example , are the exper@@ ts in mon@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ e making : you make a film and it has a wel@@ l-@@ form@@ ed beginning , mi@@ ddle and end , and in some sense the art of it is that ."
"And you then say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s an opportunity for making convers@@ ational mov@@ ies . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?"
And it sort of ni@@ b@@ b@@ les at the cor@@ e of the whole prof@@ es@@ sion and all the as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions of that medi@@ um .
"So , book writing is the same thing ."
"What I &apos;ll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mi@@ x@@ ed now with ... all sor@@ ts of things live in there , but you have to keep a few things in mind ."
One is that this book know@@ s about itself .
E@@ ach fra@@ me of the movie has information about itself .
"So it know@@ s , or at least there is compu@@ ter@@ -@@ re@@ ad@@ able information in the medi@@ um itself . It &apos;s just not a st@@ atic movie fra@@ me ."
"That &apos;s one thing . The other is that you have to realize that it is a ran@@ dom ac@@ cess medi@@ um , and you can , in fact , bran@@ ch and ex@@ p@@ and and el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate and sh@@ r@@ in@@ k ."
"And here — again , my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te example — is the co@@ ok@@ book , the &quot; &quot; L@@ aro@@ us@@ se G@@ ast@@ ron@@ omi@@ qu@@ e . &quot; &quot; And I think I use the example all too often , but it &apos;s a great one because there is a clas@@ si@@ c ending in that little en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ a@@ -@@ sty@@ le co@@ ok@@ book that tel@@ ls you how to do something like pen@@ gu@@ in , and you get to the end of the re@@ ci@@ pe and it says , &quot; &quot; C@@ ook until done . &quot; &quot; Now , that would be , if you will , the top green tr@@ ack , which doesn &apos;t mean too much . But you might have to el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate for me or for somebody who isn &apos;t an exper@@ t , and say , &quot; C@@ ook at 3@@ 80 de@@ gre@@ es for 4@@ 5 minutes . &quot;"
"And then for a real begin@@ ner , you would go down even f@@ ur@@ ther and el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate more — say , &quot; &quot; O@@ p@@ en the o@@ ven , pre@@ he@@ at , wa@@ it for the light to go out , open the door , don &apos;t leave it open too long , put the pen@@ gu@@ in in and sh@@ u@@ t the door ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) whatever ."
And that &apos;s a much more el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate one than you dri@@ b@@ ble back .
That &apos;s one kind of use of ran@@ dom ac@@ cess .
And the other is where you want to expla@@ in the same thing in different ways .
"If you &apos;re in a clas@@ s@@ room situ@@ ation and somebody as@@ ks a question , the last thing you do is re@@ pe@@ at what you just said ."
"You try and think of a different way of saying the same thing , or if you know the particular stud@@ ent and that stud@@ ent &apos;s cogni@@ tive sty@@ le , then you might say it in a way that you think would have a good im@@ pe@@ dance mat@@ ch with that stud@@ ent ."
"There are all sor@@ ts of techni@@ qu@@ es you will use — and again , this is a different kind of bran@@ ching ."
"So , what I will show you is ... it &apos;s a rather bor@@ ing book , but I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id sometimes you have to do bor@@ ing boo@@ ks because your spon@@ sor@@ s ar@@ en &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly interested in fi@@ ction and en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment . And this is a book on how to re@@ pa@@ ir a trans@@ mis@@ sion ."
"Now , I don &apos;t even know what v@@ in@@ t@@ age the trans@@ mis@@ sion is , but let me just show you very quickly some of it , and we &apos;ll move on ."
( V@@ ide@@ o ) N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : And contin@@ ue to get descri@@ p@@ tions for each of these ch@@ ap@@ ters .
"N@@ i@@ ch@@ ol@@ as Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te : Now , this is his table of cont@@ ents ."
"J@@ ust a picture of the trans@@ mis@@ sion , and as you ru@@ b your fin@@ ger across the trans@@ mis@@ sion it high@@ li@@ ghts the v@@ ari@@ ous par@@ ts ."
"N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : When I find a ch@@ ap@@ ter that I want to see , I just tou@@ ch the te@@ xt and the system will form@@ at p@@ ages for me to read ."
"The words or ph@@ ra@@ ses that are li@@ t up in red are g@@ lo@@ s@@ s@@ ary words , so I can get a different defini@@ tion by just tou@@ ching the word , and the defini@@ tion ap@@ pe@@ ars , super@@ im@@ posed over the il@@ lu@@ str@@ ation ."
"N@@ N : This is about the oil p@@ an , or the oil fil@@ ter and all that ."
This is relati@@ vely important because it se@@ ts the p@@ age ...
N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : This is another example of a p@@ age with g@@ lo@@ s@@ s@@ ary words high@@ li@@ gh@@ ted in red .
"I can get a defini@@ tion of these words just by tou@@ ching them , and the defini@@ tion will ap@@ pe@@ ar in the il@@ lu@@ str@@ ation cor@@ ner ."
"I can get back to the il@@ lu@@ str@@ ation , but in this case it &apos;s not a single fra@@ me , but it &apos;s actually a movie of someone coming into the fra@@ me and doing the re@@ pa@@ ir that &apos;s descri@@ bed in the te@@ xt ."
"The two@@ -@@ he@@ ad@@ ed sli@@ der is a speed control that allow@@ s me to wat@@ ch the movie at v@@ ari@@ ous spe@@ eds , in forward or re@@ verse ."
And the movie is disp@@ la@@ yed as a full fra@@ me movie .
I can go back to the beginning ... and play the movie at full speed .
"H@@ ere &apos;s another ste@@ p@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ ste@@ p pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re , only in this case — N@@ N : O@@ kay , this movie is ... E@@ very@@ body &apos;s heard of soun@@ d-@@ syn@@ c mov@@ ies — this is te@@ x@@ t-@@ syn@@ c mov@@ ies , so as the movie pla@@ ys , the te@@ xt gets high@@ li@@ gh@@ ted ."
We high@@ light the te@@ xt as we go through the movie .
"R@@ e@@ pa@@ ir@@ man : ... N@@ ot too far out . F@@ ron@@ t po@@ les , pre@@ fer@@ ably ."
"D@@ on &apos;t lo@@ os@@ en them too far . If you lo@@ os@@ en them too far , you &apos;ll have a big m@@ ess ."
N@@ N : I s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct that some of you might not even understand that language .
"( Laughter ) OK . I &apos;m at the third and last part of this , which I said I would make an at@@ tem@@ pt to at least give you some exam@@ ples that may be more dire@@ ct@@ ly re@@ lated to the world of en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment ."
"And of course , good education has got to be good en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , so my first example will be d@@ raw@@ n from a very re@@ cent experim@@ ent that we &apos;ve been doing — in this case , in S@@ ene@@ g@@ al — where we have tr@@ ied to use per@@ s@@ onal compu@@ ters as a pe@@ da@@ go@@ gi@@ cal medi@@ um . But not as teach@@ ing mach@@ ines at all ; the whole noti@@ on is to use this as an instru@@ ment where there is a comple@@ te re@@ vers@@ al of ro@@ les — the child is , if you will , the teach@@ er and the mach@@ ine is the stud@@ ent — and the art of computer progra@@ m@@ ming is a ve@@ hi@@ cle that sort of appro@@ x@@ im@@ ates thinking about thinking ."
But teach@@ ing kids progra@@ m@@ ming per se is ut@@ ter@@ ly ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant .
"And there are just a few sli@@ des I want to go through , but there &apos;s a story I &apos;d like to tell . And that was when , before we did this in any develo@@ ping countries — we &apos;re doing it , in fact , in three develo@@ ping countries right now : P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an , Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a and S@@ ene@@ g@@ al — we did it in some pretty rou@@ gh are@@ as of New York C@@ ity ."
"And one child , wh@@ ose name I &apos;ve for@@ got@@ ten , was about seven or eight years old , absolu@@ tely consi@@ der@@ ed ment@@ ally h@@ an@@ di@@ ca@@ pped — couldn &apos;t read , didn &apos;t even make it in the low@@ est se@@ ction of the school &apos;s clas@@ ses — and was pretty much not in school , though physi@@ cally there ."
"But did h@@ an@@ g around the , quot@@ e , &quot; &quot; computer room , &quot; &quot; where there were quite a few compu@@ ters , and learned this particular language called L@@ o@@ go — and learned it with great e@@ ase and found it a lot of fun , it was very interesting . And one day , by ch@@ ance , some visi@@ t@@ ors from the N@@ I@@ E came by in their d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ bre@@ ast@@ ed su@@ its looking at this se@@ tu@@ p , and n@@ one of the children who were nor@@ m@@ ally there , ex@@ cept for this one child , were there ."
"He was , and he said , &quot; &quot; Let me show you how this works , &quot; &quot; and they got an absolu@@ tely ing@@ en@@ u@@ ous , wonderful descri@@ ption of L@@ o@@ go ."
"And the child was just zi@@ pping right through it , show@@ ing them all sor@@ ts of things until they asked him how to do something which he couldn &apos;t expla@@ in and so he fli@@ pped through the man@@ u@@ al , found the ex@@ plan@@ ation and ty@@ ped the comm@@ and and got it to do what they asked ."
"They were deli@@ gh@@ ted , and by the time it was time to go see the prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al , wh@@ om they &apos;d actually come to see — not the computer room — they went up@@ sta@@ ir@@ s and they said , &quot; &quot; This is absolu@@ tely re@@ mark@@ able !"
"That child was very arti@@ cul@@ ate and show@@ ed us and even de@@ al@@ t with the things he couldn &apos;t do au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally with that man@@ u@@ al . It was just absolu@@ tely fanta@@ stic . &quot; &quot; The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a dre@@ ad@@ ful mist@@ ake , because that child can &apos;t read ."
"And you obvi@@ ously have been ho@@ od@@ win@@ ked or you &apos;ve tal@@ ked about somebody else . &quot; &quot; And they all got up and they all went dow@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s and the child was still there . And they did something very inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent : they asked the child , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you read ? &quot; &quot; And the child said , &quot; &quot; No , I can &apos;t . &quot; &quot; And then they said , &quot; &quot; But wa@@ it a minu@@ te . You just looked through that man@@ u@@ al and you found ... &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , but that &apos;s not re@@ ading . &quot; &quot; And so they said , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s re@@ ading then ? &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Well , re@@ ading is this j@@ un@@ k they give me in little boo@@ ks to read ."
"It &apos;s absolu@@ tely ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant , ( Laughter ) and I get nothing for it ."
"But here , with a little bit of ef@@ for@@ t I get a lot of re@@ turn . &quot; &quot; And it really me@@ ant something to the child ."
"The child read beauti@@ fully , it turned out , and was really very compe@@ t@@ ent . So it actually me@@ ant something ."
"And that story has many other an@@ e@@ c@@ dot@@ es that are si@@ mi@@ lar , but wo@@ w . The key to the future of compu@@ ters in education is right there , and it is : when does it mean something to a child ?"
"There is a my@@ th , and it tru@@ ly is a my@@ th : we believe — and I &apos;m sure a lot of you believe in this room — that it is har@@ der to read and write than it is to learn how to speak ."
"And it &apos;s not , but we think spe@@ e@@ ch — &quot; &quot; My God , little children pi@@ ck it up some@@ how , and by the age of two they &apos;re doing a medi@@ oc@@ re job , and by three and four they &apos;re spe@@ aking reas@@ on@@ ably well ."
"And yet you &apos;ve got to go to school to learn how to read , and you have to si@@ t in a clas@@ s@@ room and somebody has to te@@ ach you ."
"H@@ ence , it must be har@@ der . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s not har@@ der ."
What the tru@@ th is is that spe@@ aking has great val@@ ue to a child ; the child can get a great deal by talking to you .
Re@@ ading and writing is ut@@ ter@@ ly us@@ el@@ ess .
"There is no reason for a child to read and write ex@@ cept bl@@ ind fai@@ th , and that it &apos;s going to help you . ( Laughter ) So what happens is you go to school and people say , &quot; &quot; J@@ ust believe me , you &apos;re going to like it ."
"You &apos;re going to like re@@ ading , &quot; &quot; and just read and read ."
"O@@ n the other hand , you give a kid — a thre@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ old kid — a computer and they ty@@ pe a little comm@@ and and — Po@@ of ! — something happens ."
"And all of a sud@@ den ... You may not call that re@@ ading and writing , but a certain bit of ty@@ ping and re@@ ading stuff on the scre@@ en has a huge pa@@ y@@ off , and it &apos;s a lot of fun ."
"And in fact , it &apos;s a powerful edu@@ c@@ ational instru@@ ment ."
"Well , in S@@ ene@@ g@@ al we found that this was the tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal clas@@ s@@ room : 1@@ 20 kids — three per des@@ k — one teach@@ er , a little bit of chal@@ k ."
"This stud@@ ent was one of our first students , and it &apos;s the girl on the left le@@ an@@ ing with her chal@@ k@@ bo@@ ard , and she came ... within two days — I want to show you the program she wro@@ te , and remember her ha@@ ir@@ sty@@ le . And that is the program she made ."
"That &apos;s what me@@ ant something to her , is doing the ha@@ ir pat@@ ter@@ n , and actually did it within two days — an hour each day — and found it was , to her , absolu@@ tely the most me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful piece ..."
"But ro@@ ot@@ ed in that , little did she know how much know@@ le@@ dge she was ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing about ge@@ ome@@ try and just mat@@ h and logi@@ c and all the rest ."
"And again , I could talk for three hours about this sub@@ je@@ ct ."
I will come to my last example and then qu@@ it .
"And my last example — as some of my form@@ er colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es , wh@@ om I see in the room , can imagine what it will be ."
"@@ Yes , it is . It &apos;s our work — that was a while ago , and it still is my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te project — of tele@@ con@@ fer@@ en@@ cing ."
"And the reason it re@@ ma@@ ins a fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te project is that we were asked to do a tele@@ con@@ fer@@ en@@ cing system where you had the fol@@ low@@ ing situ@@ ation : you had five people at five different si@@ tes — they were known people — and you had to have these people in tele@@ con@@ fer@@ ence , such that each one was ut@@ ter@@ ly con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that the other four were physi@@ cally present ."
"Now , that is su@@ f@@ fi@@ cien@@ tly z@@ any that we would , obvi@@ ously , j@@ um@@ p to the ba@@ it , and we did ."
And the fact that we knew the people — we had to take a p@@ age out of the history of W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ney — we actually went so far as to build C@@ R@@ T@@ s in the sha@@ p@@ es of the people &apos;s fac@@ es .
"So if I wanted to call my friend Pe@@ ter S@@ pra@@ gu@@ e on the phone , my se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the des@@ k , ( Laughter ) and that would be the T@@ V used for the oc@@ ca@@ sion ."
And it &apos;s un@@ can@@ ny : there &apos;s no way I can expla@@ in to you the amount of ey@@ e cont@@ act you get with that physi@@ cal face proje@@ cted on a 3@@ D C@@ R@@ T of that sort .
"The next thing that we had to do is to per@@ su@@ ade them that there needed to be sp@@ ati@@ al cor@@ respon@@ dence , which is stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward , but again , it &apos;s something that didn &apos;t f@@ all natur@@ ally out of a tele@@ communi@@ c@@ ations or compu@@ ting sty@@ le of thinking ; it was a very , if you will , archite@@ ctu@@ ral or sp@@ ati@@ al con@@ cept ."
"And that was to re@@ cogni@@ ze that when you si@@ t around the table , the ac@@ tu@@ al lo@@ cation of the people be@@ comes rather important ."
"And when somebody gets up , in fact , to go answer a phone or use a ba@@ th@@ room or something , the em@@ p@@ ty se@@ at be@@ comes , if you will , that person . And you point fre@@ qu@@ ently to the em@@ p@@ ty se@@ at and you say , &quot; &quot; He or she wouldn &apos;t ag@@ ree , &quot; &quot; and the em@@ p@@ ty cha@@ ir is that person and the sp@@ ati@@ ality is c@@ ru@@ cial ."
"So we said , &quot; &quot; Well , these will be on round tab@@ les and the order around the table had to be the same , so that at my site , I would be , if you will , real and then at each other &apos;s site you &apos;d have these pla@@ stic he@@ ads ."
"And the pla@@ stic he@@ ads , sometimes you want to project them ."
"And there are a number of sch@@ em@@ es , which I don &apos;t want to d@@ well on , but this is the one that we finally used where we proje@@ cted on@@ to re@@ ar scre@@ en materi@@ al that was mo@@ l@@ ded in the face — liter@@ ally in the face of the person ."
"And I &apos;ll show you one more sli@@ de , where this is actually made from something called a so@@ li@@ d photogra@@ ph and is the scre@@ en ."
"Now , we tr@@ ack , on the person &apos;s head , the head moti@@ ons — so we trans@@ m@@ it with a video the head posi@@ tions — and so this head mo@@ ves in about two ax@@ es ."
"So if I , all of a sud@@ den , turn to the person to my left and start talking to that person , then at the person to my right &apos;s site , he &apos;ll see these two pla@@ stic he@@ ads talking to each other ."
"And then if that person inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ts , then those two he@@ ads may turn ."
"And it really is re@@ con@@ stru@@ cting , quite ac@@ cur@@ ately , tele@@ con@@ fer@@ en@@ cing ."
&quot; D@@ on &apos;t talk to str@@ ang@@ ers . &quot;
"You have heard that ph@@ ra@@ se ut@@ ter@@ ed by your friends , family , scho@@ ols and the media for de@@ ca@@ des ."
It &apos;s a nor@@ m . It &apos;s a social nor@@ m .
"But it &apos;s a spe@@ cial kind of social nor@@ m , because it &apos;s a social nor@@ m that wan@@ ts to tell us who we can rel@@ ate to and who we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t rel@@ ate to ."
"&quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t talk to str@@ ang@@ ers &quot; &quot; says , &quot; &quot; S@@ ta@@ y from any@@ one who &apos;s not fami@@ li@@ ar to you ."
S@@ ti@@ ck with the people you know .
S@@ ti@@ ck with people like you . &quot; &quot; How ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing is that ?
"It &apos;s not really what we do , is it , when we &apos;re at our best ?"
"When we &apos;re at our best , we re@@ ach out to people who are not like us , because when we do that , we learn from people who are not like us ."
"My ph@@ ra@@ se for this val@@ ue of being with &quot; &quot; not like us &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; str@@ ang@@ en@@ ess , &quot; &quot; and my point is that in today &apos;s di@@ gi@@ t@@ ally inten@@ sive world , str@@ ang@@ ers are quite f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly not the point ."
"The point that we should be wor@@ ried about is , how much str@@ ang@@ en@@ ess are we getting ?"
"Wh@@ y str@@ ang@@ en@@ ess ? Because our social rel@@ ations are incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly medi@@ ated by data , and data turns our social rel@@ ations into di@@ gi@@ tal rel@@ ations , and that means that our di@@ gi@@ tal rel@@ ations now de@@ p@@ end ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly on technology to bring to them a sense of ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness , a sense of disco@@ very , a sense of sur@@ pri@@ se and un@@ pre@@ di@@ ct@@ ability ."
Why not str@@ ang@@ ers ?
Because str@@ ang@@ ers are part of a world of really ri@@ gi@@ d b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies .
"They be@@ long to a world of people I know ver@@ su@@ s people I don &apos;t know , and in the con@@ te@@ xt of my di@@ gi@@ tal rel@@ ations , I &apos;m already doing things with people I don &apos;t know ."
The question isn &apos;t whether or not I know you .
"The question is , what can I do with you ?"
What can I learn with you ?
What can we do together that b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts us both ?
"I spend a lot of time thinking about how the social land@@ s@@ cape is chang@@ ing , how new technolog@@ ies create new con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts and new opportuni@@ ties for people ."
The most important chang@@ es fac@@ ing us today have to do with data and what data is doing to sha@@ pe the kinds of di@@ gi@@ tal rel@@ ations that will be possible for us in the future .
The econom@@ ies of the future de@@ p@@ end on that .
O@@ ur social lives in the future de@@ p@@ end on that .
The thre@@ at to wor@@ ry about isn &apos;t str@@ ang@@ ers .
The thre@@ at to wor@@ ry about is whether or not we &apos;re getting our fa@@ ir share of str@@ ang@@ en@@ ess .
"Now , 20@@ th@@ -@@ century psycho@@ logi@@ sts and so@@ ci@@ ologi@@ sts were thinking about str@@ ang@@ ers , but they wer@@ en &apos;t thinking so dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cally about human rel@@ ations , and they were thinking about str@@ ang@@ ers in the con@@ te@@ xt of in@@ flu@@ en@@ cing prac@@ ti@@ ces ."
"S@@ tan@@ ley M@@ il@@ gra@@ m from the &apos; 6@@ 0s and &apos; 7@@ 0s , the cre@@ ator of the s@@ mal@@ l-@@ world experim@@ ents , which became later po@@ pu@@ lar@@ i@@ zed as six de@@ gre@@ es of se@@ par@@ ation , made the point that any two ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ari@@ ly se@@ le@@ cted people were li@@ ke@@ ly conne@@ cted from between five to seven inter@@ medi@@ ary ste@@ ps ."
H@@ is point was that str@@ ang@@ ers are out there .
We can re@@ ach them . There are pa@@ ths that en@@ able us to re@@ ach them .
"M@@ ar@@ k G@@ ran@@ o@@ ve@@ t@@ ter , St@@ an@@ for@@ d so@@ ci@@ ologi@@ st , in 19@@ 7@@ 3 in his se@@ min@@ al es@@ say &quot; &quot; The S@@ tr@@ eng@@ th of W@@ e@@ ak T@@ ies , &quot; &quot; made the point that these we@@ ak ties that are a part of our net@@ works , these str@@ ang@@ ers , are actually more effe@@ ctive at dif@@ f@@ using information to us than are our stron@@ g ties , the people clo@@ s@@ est to us ."
"He makes an ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal indi@@ ct@@ ment of our stron@@ g ties when he says that these people who are so close to us , these stron@@ g ties in our lives , actually have a hom@@ og@@ eni@@ z@@ ing effe@@ ct on us ."
They produ@@ ce sam@@ en@@ ess .
"My colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es and I at In@@ te@@ l have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which di@@ gi@@ tal pl@@ at@@ form@@ s are re@@ sha@@ ping our every@@ day lives , what kinds of new rou@@ t@@ ines are possible ."
"We &apos;ve been looking speci@@ fi@@ cally at the kinds of di@@ gi@@ tal pl@@ at@@ form@@ s that have en@@ ab@@ led us to take our pos@@ s@@ es@@ sions , those things that used to be very re@@ stri@@ cted to us and to our friends in our h@@ ous@@ es , and to make them available to people we don &apos;t know ."
"W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s our clo@@ the@@ s , whether it &apos;s our cars , whether it &apos;s our bi@@ k@@ es , whether it &apos;s our boo@@ ks or music , we are able to take our pos@@ s@@ es@@ sions now and make them available to people we &apos;ve never met ."
"And we con@@ clu@@ ded a very important in@@ si@@ ght , which was that as people &apos;s relation@@ ships to the things in their lives change , so do their rel@@ ations with other people ."
And yet re@@ com@@ men@@ d@@ ation system after re@@ com@@ men@@ d@@ ation system contin@@ u@@ es to mi@@ ss the boat .
"It contin@@ u@@ es to try to pre@@ di@@ ct what I need based on some past char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ z@@ ation of who I am , of what I &apos;ve already done ."
"S@@ e@@ cu@@ ri@@ ty technology after secu@@ ri@@ ty technology contin@@ u@@ es to design data prote@@ ction in terms of thre@@ ats and att@@ ac@@ ks , ke@@ e@@ ping me lo@@ cked into really ri@@ gi@@ d kinds of rel@@ ations ."
C@@ ate@@ gor@@ ies like &quot; &quot; friends &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; family &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; cont@@ ac@@ ts &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es &quot; &quot; don &apos;t tell me anything about my ac@@ tu@@ al rel@@ ations .
"A more effe@@ ctive way to think about my rel@@ ations might be in terms of clo@@ sen@@ ess and di@@ stance , where at any given point in time , with any single person , I am both close and di@@ st@@ ant from that individu@@ al , all as a fun@@ ction of what I need to do right now ."
Pe@@ ople ar@@ en &apos;t close or di@@ st@@ ant .
"P@@ e@@ ople are always a com@@ bin@@ ation of the two , and that com@@ bin@@ ation is con@@ stan@@ tly chang@@ ing ."
What if technolog@@ ies could inter@@ ven@@ e to dis@@ ru@@ pt the bal@@ ance of certain kinds of relation@@ ships ? What if technolog@@ ies could inter@@ ven@@ e
to help me find the person that I need right now ?
"S@@ tr@@ ang@@ en@@ ess is that c@@ ali@@ br@@ ation of clo@@ sen@@ ess and di@@ stance that en@@ ab@@ les me to find the people that I need right now , that en@@ ab@@ les me to find the sources of in@@ ti@@ m@@ acy , of disco@@ very , and of in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation that I need right now ."
S@@ tr@@ ang@@ en@@ ess is not about me@@ e@@ ting str@@ ang@@ ers .
It simply makes the point that we need to dis@@ ru@@ pt our z@@ ones of fami@@ li@@ ari@@ ty .
"So j@@ og@@ g@@ ing those z@@ ones of fami@@ li@@ ari@@ ty is one way to think about str@@ ang@@ en@@ ess , and it &apos;s a problem fac@@ ed not just by individu@@ als today , but also by organiz@@ ations , organiz@@ ations that are trying to em@@ brac@@ e mas@@ si@@ vely new opportuni@@ ties ."
"W@@ he@@ ther you &apos;re a poli@@ tical par@@ ty in@@ si@@ st@@ ing to your de@@ tri@@ ment on a very ri@@ gi@@ d noti@@ on of who be@@ lon@@ gs and who does not , whether you &apos;re the government prote@@ cting social institu@@ tions like mar@@ ri@@ age and re@@ stri@@ cting ac@@ cess of those institu@@ tions to the few , whether you &apos;re a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er in her be@@ dro@@ om who &apos;s trying to j@@ ost@@ le her rel@@ ations with her parents , str@@ ang@@ en@@ ess is a way to think about how we pa@@ ve the way to new kinds of rel@@ ations ."
We have to change the nor@@ ms .
We have to change the nor@@ ms in order to en@@ able new kinds of technolog@@ ies as a basi@@ s for new kinds of bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es .
What interesting questions lie a@@ head for us in this world of no str@@ ang@@ ers ?
How might we think differ@@ ently about our rel@@ ations with people ? How might we think differ@@ ently about our rel@@ ations
with di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted grou@@ ps of people ?
"H@@ ow might we think differ@@ ently about our rel@@ ations with technolog@@ ies , things that effe@@ cti@@ vely become social parti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts in their own right ?"
The r@@ ange of di@@ gi@@ tal rel@@ ations is ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary .
"In the con@@ te@@ xt of this bro@@ ad r@@ ange of di@@ gi@@ tal rel@@ ations , sa@@ fe@@ ly see@@ king str@@ ang@@ en@@ ess might very well be a new basi@@ s for that in@@ no@@ vation ."

Let &apos;s start with the first photogra@@ ph N@@ A@@ SA ob@@ ta@@ ined of planet Mars .
"This is f@@ ly@@ -@@ by , Mar@@ in@@ er IV ."
It was taken in 19@@ 6@@ 5 .
"When this picture ap@@ pe@@ ared , that wel@@ l-@@ known scienti@@ fic jour@@ na@@ l , The New York T@@ im@@ es , wro@@ te in its e@@ di@@ t@@ ori@@ al , &quot; &quot; Mars is un@@ interesting ."
"It &apos;s a de@@ ad world . N@@ A@@ SA should not spend any time or ef@@ for@@ t stu@@ dy@@ ing Mars any@@ more . &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , our le@@ ad@@ ers in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton at N@@ A@@ SA he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters knew better and we began a very ex@@ ten@@ sive study of the red planet ."
"One of the key questions in all of science , &quot; Is there life outside of Earth ? &quot;"
I believe that Mars is the most li@@ ke@@ ly tar@@ get for life outside the Earth .
I &apos;m going to show you in a few minutes some amazing meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments that su@@ ggest there may be life on Mars .
But let me start with a V@@ i@@ king photogra@@ ph .
This is a com@@ posi@@ te taken by V@@ i@@ king in 19@@ 7@@ 6 .
V@@ i@@ king was develo@@ ped and man@@ aged at the N@@ A@@ SA L@@ ang@@ ley R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch C@@ enter .
We s@@ ent two or@@ bi@@ ters and two land@@ ers in the sum@@ m@@ er of 19@@ 7@@ 6 .
"We had four sp@@ ace@@ c@@ ra@@ ft , two around Mars , two on the surface — an amazing ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment ."
This is the first photogra@@ ph taken from the surface of any planet .
This is a V@@ i@@ king L@@ an@@ der photogra@@ ph of the surface of Mars .
"And y@@ es , the red planet is red ."
"M@@ ars is half the size of the Earth , but because two@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ ds of the Earth is co@@ vered by water , the land area on Mars is com@@ par@@ able to the land area on Earth ."
"So , Mars is a pretty big place even though it &apos;s half the size ."
We have ob@@ ta@@ ined to@@ po@@ gra@@ phi@@ c meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments of the surface of Mars . We understand the ele@@ vation differ@@ ences .
We know a lot about Mars .
"M@@ ars has the largest vol@@ c@@ ano in the solar system , O@@ ly@@ m@@ pu@@ s M@@ ons ."
"M@@ ars has the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on of the solar system , V@@ al@@ les Mar@@ in@@ er@@ is ."
"@@ V@@ ery , very interesting planet ."
"M@@ ars has the largest impac@@ t c@@ rat@@ er in the solar system , H@@ el@@ l@@ as B@@ a@@ si@@ n ."
"This is 2@@ ,000 miles across ."
"If you happened to be on Mars when this impac@@ tor h@@ it , it was a really bad day on Mars ."
( Laughter ) This is O@@ ly@@ m@@ pu@@ s M@@ ons .
This is bi@@ g@@ ger than the state of A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona .
"@@ V@@ ol@@ can@@ o@@ es are important , because vol@@ can@@ o@@ es produ@@ ce atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ es and they produ@@ ce oce@@ ans ."
"We &apos;re looking at V@@ al@@ les Mar@@ in@@ er@@ is , the largest c@@ any@@ on in the solar system , super@@ im@@ posed on a ma@@ p of the United States , 3@@ ,000 miles across ."
"One of the most in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing fe@@ at@@ ures about Mars , the N@@ ational A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of S@@ cien@@ ce says one of the 10 major m@@ yst@@ er@@ ies of the space age , is why certain are@@ as of Mars are so high@@ ly mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ zed ."
We call this c@@ ru@@ st@@ al mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ sm .
"There are regi@@ ons on Mars , where , for some reason — we don &apos;t understand why at this point — the surface is very , very high@@ ly mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ zed ."
Is there water on Mars ?
"The answer is no , there is no li@@ qu@@ id water on the surface of Mars today ."
But there is in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing evi@@ dence that su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that the early history of Mars there may have been ri@@ ver@@ s and f@@ ast f@@ low@@ ing water .
T@@ od@@ ay Mars is very very d@@ ry .
"We believe there &apos;s some water in the pol@@ ar ca@@ ps , there are pol@@ ar ca@@ ps of Nor@@ th Po@@ le and S@@ outh Po@@ le ."
Here are some re@@ cent images .
This is from S@@ pi@@ r@@ it and O@@ p@@ portuni@@ ty .
"These images that show at one time , there was very f@@ ast f@@ low@@ ing water on the surface of Mars ."
Why is water important ? W@@ ater is important because if you want life you have to have water .
"W@@ ater is the key in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ t in the ev@@ olution , the ori@@ g@@ in of life on a planet ."
"H@@ ere is some picture of An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca and a picture of O@@ ly@@ m@@ pu@@ s M@@ ons , very si@@ mi@@ lar fe@@ at@@ ures , gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ s ."
"So , this is f@@ roz@@ en water ."
This is ice water on Mars .
This is my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te picture . This was just taken a few weeks ago .
It has not been seen publi@@ c@@ ly .
"This is Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an space ag@@ en@@ cy Mars E@@ x@@ pre@@ ss , image of a c@@ rat@@ er on Mars and in the mi@@ ddle of the c@@ rat@@ er we have li@@ qu@@ id water , we have ice ."
V@@ ery in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing photogra@@ ph .
"We now believe that in the early history of Mars , which is 4@@ .@@ 6 billion years ago , 4@@ .@@ 6 billion years ago , Mars was very Ear@@ th@@ -@@ like ."
"M@@ ars had ri@@ ver@@ s , Mars had l@@ ak@@ es , but more important Mars had plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ scale oce@@ ans ."
"We believe that the oce@@ ans were in the nor@@ ther@@ n he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here , and this area in blue , which shows a de@@ pres@@ sion of about four miles , was the an@@ cient ocean area on the surface of Mars ."
W@@ here did the ocean &apos;s wor@@ th of water on Mars go ?
"Well , we have an idea ."
This is a meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment we ob@@ ta@@ ined a few years ago from a Mar@@ s@@ -@@ or@@ bi@@ ting s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te called O@@ dy@@ s@@ se@@ y .
"S@@ u@@ b@@ -@@ surface water on Mars , f@@ roz@@ en in the form of ice ."
"And this shows the percent . If it &apos;s a blu@@ e@@ is@@ h color , it means 16 percent by we@@ ight ."
"S@@ i@@ x@@ te@@ en percent , by we@@ ight , of the inter@@ i@@ or con@@ ta@@ ins f@@ roz@@ en water , or ice ."
"So , there is a lot of water be@@ low the surface ."
"The most in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing and pu@@ z@@ z@@ ling meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment , in my op@@ ini@@ on , we &apos;ve ob@@ ta@@ ined of Mars , was rele@@ as@@ ed ear@@ lie@@ r this year in the mag@@ az@@ ine S@@ cien@@ ce ."
"And what we &apos;re looking at is the pre@@ sen@@ ce of the gas meth@@ ane , C@@ H@@ 4 , in the atmo@@ sp@@ here of Mars ."
And you can see there are three di@@ st@@ in@@ ct regi@@ ons of meth@@ ane .
Why is meth@@ ane important ?
"Because on Earth , almost all — 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 9 percent — of the meth@@ ane is produ@@ ced by living systems , not little green men , but micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic life be@@ low the surface or at the surface ."
"We now have evi@@ dence that meth@@ ane is in the atmo@@ sp@@ here of Mars , a gas that , on Earth , is bi@@ og@@ eni@@ c in ori@@ g@@ in , produ@@ ced by living systems ."
"These are the three p@@ lu@@ mes : A , B@@ 1 , B@@ 2 ."
"And this is the ter@@ ra@@ in it ap@@ pe@@ ars over , and we know from ge@@ ologi@@ cal stud@@ ies that these regi@@ ons are the ol@@ d@@ est regi@@ ons on Mars ."
"In fact , the Earth and Mars are both 4@@ .@@ 6 billion years old ."
The ol@@ d@@ est ro@@ ck on Earth is only 3@@ .@@ 6 billion .
"The reason there is a bi@@ lli@@ on-@@ year ga@@ p in our ge@@ ologi@@ cal under@@ standing is because of pl@@ ate te@@ ct@@ oni@@ cs , The c@@ r@@ ust of the Earth has been re@@ cy@@ c@@ led ."
We have no ge@@ ologi@@ cal recor@@ d pri@@ or for the first billion years .
That recor@@ d ex@@ ist@@ s on Mars .
And this ter@@ ra@@ in that we &apos;re looking at d@@ ates back to 4@@ .@@ 6 billion years when Earth and Mars were form@@ ed .
It was a T@@ u@@ es@@ day .
( Laughter ) This is a ma@@ p that shows where we &apos;ve put our sp@@ ace@@ c@@ ra@@ ft on the surface of Mars .
"H@@ ere is V@@ i@@ king I , V@@ i@@ king I@@ I ."
This is O@@ p@@ portuni@@ ty . This is S@@ pi@@ r@@ it .
"This is Mars P@@ a@@ th@@ fin@@ der . This is P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x , we just put two years ago ."
N@@ oti@@ ce all of our ro@@ ver@@ s and all of our land@@ ers have gone to the nor@@ ther@@ n he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here .
That &apos;s because the nor@@ ther@@ n he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here is the regi@@ on of the an@@ cient ocean basi@@ n .
There ar@@ en &apos;t many c@@ rat@@ ers .
And that &apos;s because the water prote@@ cted the basi@@ n from being impac@@ ted by ast@@ er@@ o@@ i@@ ds and me@@ te@@ ori@@ tes .
But look in the s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here .
"In the s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here there are impac@@ t c@@ rat@@ ers , there are vol@@ c@@ ani@@ c c@@ rat@@ ers ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s H@@ el@@ l@@ as B@@ a@@ si@@ n , a very very different place , ge@@ ologi@@ cally ."
"L@@ ook where the meth@@ ane is , the meth@@ ane is in a very rou@@ gh ter@@ ra@@ in area ."
What is the best way to un@@ ra@@ vel the m@@ yst@@ er@@ ies on Mars that exi@@ st ?
We asked this question 10 years ago .
We in@@ vi@@ ted 10 of the top Mars scienti@@ sts to the L@@ ang@@ ley R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch C@@ enter for two days .
We ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed on the bo@@ ard the major questions that have not been ans@@ wer@@ ed .
And we spent two days deci@@ ding how to best answer this question .
And the resul@@ t of our me@@ e@@ ting was a rob@@ oti@@ c ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t-@@ power@@ ed air@@ pl@@ ane we call A@@ R@@ E@@ S .
It &apos;s an A@@ eri@@ al Re@@ gi@@ on@@ al@@ -@@ scale En@@ viron@@ ment@@ al S@@ ur@@ ve@@ y@@ or .
There &apos;s a model of A@@ R@@ E@@ S here .
This is a 20@@ -@@ percent scale model .
This air@@ pl@@ ane was desig@@ ned at the L@@ ang@@ ley R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch C@@ enter .
"If any place in the world can build an air@@ pl@@ ane to f@@ ly on Mars , it &apos;s the L@@ ang@@ ley R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch C@@ enter , for almost 100 years a le@@ ading cen@@ ter of a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ ti@@ cs in the world ."
We f@@ ly about a mi@@ le ab@@ o@@ ve the surface .
"We co@@ ver hundre@@ ds of miles , and we f@@ ly about 4@@ 50 miles an hour ."
"We can do things that ro@@ ver@@ s can &apos;t do and land@@ ers can &apos;t do : We can f@@ ly ab@@ o@@ ve m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins , vol@@ can@@ o@@ es , impac@@ t c@@ rat@@ ers ; we f@@ ly over val@@ le@@ ys ; we can f@@ ly over surface mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ sm , the pol@@ ar ca@@ ps , sub@@ surface water ; and we can sear@@ ch for life on Mars ."
"But , of equ@@ al import@@ ance , as we f@@ ly through the atmo@@ sp@@ here of Mars , we trans@@ m@@ it that jour@@ ney , the first f@@ light of an air@@ pl@@ ane outside of the Earth , we trans@@ m@@ it those images back to Earth ."
And our go@@ al is to inspi@@ re the American public who is pa@@ ying for this mis@@ sion through ta@@ x dollars .
"But more important we will inspi@@ re the next gener@@ ation of scienti@@ sts , technologi@@ sts , engine@@ ers and ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ ans ."
"And that &apos;s a cri@@ tical area of national secu@@ ri@@ ty and economic vi@@ t@@ ality , to make sure we produ@@ ce the next gener@@ ation of scienti@@ sts , engine@@ ers , ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ ans and technologi@@ sts ."
This is what A@@ R@@ E@@ S looks like as it fl@@ ies over Mars .
We pre@@ program it .
We will f@@ ly where the meth@@ ane is .
"We will have instru@@ ments ab@@ o@@ ard the pl@@ ane that will sam@@ ple , every three minutes , the atmo@@ sp@@ here of Mars ."
We will look for meth@@ ane as well as other g@@ as@@ ses produ@@ ced by living systems .
"We will p@@ in@@ point where these g@@ ases em@@ an@@ ate from , because we can meas@@ ure the gra@@ d@@ ien@@ t where it comes from , and there , we can dire@@ ct the next mis@@ sion to land right in that area ."
How do we transpor@@ t an air@@ pl@@ ane to Mars ?
"In two words , very car@@ e@@ fully ."
"The problem is we don &apos;t f@@ ly it to Mars , we put it in a sp@@ ace@@ c@@ ra@@ ft and we sen@@ d it to Mars ."
"The problem is the sp@@ ace@@ c@@ ra@@ ft &apos;s largest di@@ am@@ e@@ ter is n@@ ine fe@@ et ; A@@ R@@ E@@ S is 2@@ 1@@ -@@ fo@@ ot w@@ ing@@ sp@@ an , 1@@ 7 fe@@ et long ."
How do we get it to Mars ?
"We f@@ old it , and we transpor@@ t it in a sp@@ ace@@ c@@ ra@@ ft ."
And we have it in something called an a@@ er@@ o@@ sh@@ ell .
This is how we do it .
And we have a little video that descri@@ be@@ s the sequ@@ ence .
"@@ V@@ ide@@ o : S@@ even , six . Gre@@ en bo@@ ard . F@@ i@@ ve , four , three , two , one ."
"M@@ a@@ in eng@@ ine start , and li@@ f@@ to@@ ff ."
Jo@@ el L@@ ev@@ ine : This is a la@@ un@@ ch from the Ken@@ ne@@ dy S@@ p@@ ace C@@ enter in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da .
This is the sp@@ ace@@ c@@ ra@@ ft taking n@@ ine months to get to Mars .
It en@@ ters the atmo@@ sp@@ here of Mars .
"A lot of he@@ ating , f@@ ri@@ cti@@ onal he@@ ating . It &apos;s going 18 thous@@ and miles an hour ."
A par@@ ach@@ u@@ te open@@ s up to s@@ low it down .
The ther@@ mal ti@@ les f@@ all off .
The air@@ pl@@ ane is ex@@ posed to the atmo@@ sp@@ here for the first time .
It un@@ fol@@ ds .
The ro@@ ck@@ et eng@@ ine begin@@ s .
"We believe that in a one@@ -@@ hour f@@ light we can re@@ write the te@@ x@@ t@@ book on Mars by making high-@@ re@@ solution meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments of the atmo@@ sp@@ here , looking for g@@ ases of bi@@ og@@ eni@@ c ori@@ g@@ in , looking for g@@ ases of vol@@ c@@ ani@@ c ori@@ g@@ in , stu@@ dy@@ ing the surface , stu@@ dy@@ ing the mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ sm on the surface , which we don &apos;t understand , as well as about a do@@ z@@ en other are@@ as ."
P@@ rac@@ ti@@ ce makes perfe@@ ct .
How do we know we can do it ?
"Because we have test@@ ed A@@ R@@ E@@ S model , se@@ ver@@ al mode@@ ls in a half a do@@ z@@ en wind tu@@ n@@ ne@@ ls at the N@@ A@@ SA L@@ ang@@ ley R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch C@@ enter for eight years , under Mars con@@ di@@ tions ."
"And , of equ@@ al import@@ ance is , we test A@@ R@@ E@@ S in the Earth &apos;s atmo@@ sp@@ here , at 10@@ 0,000 fe@@ et , which is com@@ par@@ able to the den@@ sity and pres@@ sure of the atmo@@ sp@@ here on Mars where we &apos;ll f@@ ly ."
"Now , 10@@ 0,000 fe@@ et , if you f@@ ly cro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ country to L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , you f@@ ly 3@@ 7@@ ,000 fe@@ et ."
"We do our te@@ sts at 10@@ 0,000 fe@@ et ."
And I want to show you one of our te@@ sts .
This is a hal@@ f-@@ scale model .
This is a high-@@ al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de he@@ li@@ um bal@@ lo@@ on .
"This is over T@@ il@@ a@@ mo@@ ok , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."
"We put the fol@@ ded air@@ pl@@ ane on the bal@@ lo@@ on — it took about three hours to get up there — and then we rele@@ as@@ ed it on comm@@ and at 10@@ 3@@ ,000 fe@@ et , and we de@@ plo@@ y the air@@ pl@@ ane and everything works perfe@@ ct@@ ly ."
"And we &apos;ve done high-@@ al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de and low@@ -@@ al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de te@@ sts , just to perfe@@ ct this techni@@ qu@@ e ."
We &apos;re ready to go .
I have a scale model here .
But we have a fu@@ ll@@ -@@ scale model in stor@@ age at the N@@ A@@ SA L@@ ang@@ ley R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch C@@ enter .
We &apos;re ready to go . All we need is a che@@ ck from N@@ A@@ SA he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters ( Laughter ) to co@@ ver the co@@ sts .
I &apos;m pre@@ par@@ ed to d@@ on@@ ate my hon@@ or@@ ari@@ um for today &apos;s talk for this mis@@ sion .
There &apos;s actually no hon@@ or@@ ari@@ um for any@@ one for this thing .
"This is the A@@ R@@ E@@ S team ; we have about 1@@ 50 scienti@@ sts , engine@@ ers ; where we &apos;re working with J@@ et Pro@@ pul@@ sion L@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory , G@@ od@@ d@@ ard S@@ p@@ ace F@@ light C@@ enter , Am@@ es R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch C@@ enter and half a do@@ z@@ en major uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties and cor@@ por@@ ations in develo@@ ping this ."
It &apos;s a large ef@@ for@@ t . It &apos;s all at N@@ A@@ SA L@@ ang@@ ley R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch C@@ enter .
"And let me con@@ clu@@ de by saying not too far from here , right down the ro@@ ad in K@@ it@@ ty@@ ha@@ w@@ k , Nor@@ th C@@ aro@@ lin@@ a , a little more than 100 years ago history was made when we had the first power@@ ed f@@ light of an air@@ pl@@ ane on Earth ."
We are on the ver@@ ge right now to make the first f@@ light of an air@@ pl@@ ane outside the Earth &apos;s atmo@@ sp@@ here .
"We are pre@@ par@@ ed to f@@ ly this on Mars , re@@ write the te@@ x@@ t@@ book about Mars ."
"If you &apos;re interested in more information , we have a we@@ b@@ site that descri@@ be@@ s this exci@@ ting and in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing mis@@ sion , and why we want to do it ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"G@@ o@@ od morning . I think , as a gru@@ m@@ py E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an , I was brought in to play the p@@ es@@ si@@ mi@@ st this morning . So be@@ ar with me ."
"Well , I come from the form@@ er S@@ o@@ vie@@ t Re@@ public of B@@ el@@ ar@@ us , which , as some of you may know , is not exactly an o@@ a@@ sis of li@@ ber@@ al de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y ."
So that &apos;s why I &apos;ve always been fas@@ cin@@ ated with how technology could actually re@@ sha@@ pe and open up au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an socie@@ ties like ours .
"So , I &apos;m gra@@ du@@ ating colle@@ ge and , feeling very ide@@ ali@@ stic , I decided to jo@@ in the N@@ G@@ O which actually was using new media to pro@@ mot@@ e de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y and media re@@ form in much of the form@@ er S@@ o@@ vie@@ t Uni@@ on ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , to my sur@@ pri@@ se , I disco@@ vered that di@@ ct@@ at@@ or@@ ships do not c@@ ru@@ m@@ ble so e@@ a@@ si@@ ly ."
"In fact , some of them actually survi@@ ved the Inter@@ net challen@@ ge , and some got even more re@@ pres@@ sive ."
So this is when I ran out of my ide@@ ali@@ sm and decided to qu@@ it my N@@ G@@ O job and actually study how the Inter@@ net could im@@ pe@@ de de@@ moc@@ r@@ ati@@ z@@ ation .
"Now , I must tell you that this was never a very popul@@ ar ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent , and it &apos;s probably not very popul@@ ar yet with some of you sitting in this audience ."
"It was never popul@@ ar with many poli@@ tical le@@ ad@@ ers , es@@ pe@@ cially those in the United States who some@@ how thought that new media would be able to do what mis@@ si@@ les couldn &apos;t ."
"That is , pro@@ mot@@ e de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y in difficult places where everything else has already been tr@@ ied and fai@@ led ."
"And I think by 200@@ 9 , this news has finally re@@ ach@@ ed Bri@@ tain , so I should probably ad@@ d G@@ or@@ don B@@ row@@ n to this li@@ st as well ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , there is an under@@ l@@ ying ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent about logi@@ sti@@ cs , which has dri@@ ven so much of this de@@ b@@ ate . R@@ ight ?"
"So if you look at it close enough , you &apos;ll actually see that much of this is about econ@@ omi@@ cs ."
"The cy@@ ber@@ top@@ i@@ ans say , much like fa@@ x mach@@ ines and X@@ er@@ o@@ x mach@@ ines did in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , blo@@ gs and social net@@ works have radi@@ cally trans@@ form@@ ed the econ@@ omi@@ cs of prote@@ st , so people would in@@ evi@@ t@@ ably re@@ be@@ l ."
"To put it very simply , the as@@ sum@@ ption so far has been that if you give people enough conne@@ cti@@ vity , if you give them enough de@@ vi@@ ces , de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y will in@@ evi@@ t@@ ably fol@@ low ."
"And to tell you the tru@@ th , I never really b@@ ou@@ ght into this ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent , in part because I never saw three American pre@@ si@@ d@@ ents ag@@ ree on anything else in the past ."
"( Laughter ) But , you know , even be@@ y@@ ond that , if you think about the logi@@ c under@@ l@@ ying it , is something I call i@@ P@@ od li@@ ber@@ ali@@ sm , where we as@@ su@@ me that every single I@@ rani@@ an or Chin@@ ese who happens to have and love his i@@ P@@ od will also love li@@ ber@@ al de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y ."
"And again , I think this is kind of fal@@ se ."
"But I think a much bi@@ g@@ ger problem with this is that this logi@@ c — that we should be dro@@ pping i@@ Pod@@ s not b@@ om@@ b@@ s — I mean , it would make a fas@@ cin@@ ating ti@@ tle for Th@@ om@@ as F@@ r@@ ie@@ d@@ man &apos;s new book ."
( Laughter ) But this is r@@ are@@ ly a good sig@@ n . R@@ ight ?
"So , the bi@@ g@@ ger problem with this logi@@ c is that it con@@ f@@ uses the inten@@ ded ver@@ su@@ s the ac@@ tu@@ al uses of technology ."
"For those of you who think that new media of the Inter@@ net could some@@ how help us a@@ ver@@ t gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de , should look no f@@ ur@@ ther than R@@ wan@@ da , where in the &apos; 9@@ 0s it was actually two radi@@ o st@@ ations which were respon@@ si@@ ble for fu@@ el@@ ing much of the e@@ th@@ nic h@@ at@@ red in the first place ."
"But even be@@ y@@ ond that , coming back to the Inter@@ net , what you can actually see is that certain govern@@ ments have ma@@ ster@@ ed the use of cy@@ ber@@ space for pro@@ p@@ ag@@ an@@ da pur@@ pos@@ es . R@@ ight ?"
And they are building what I call the S@@ p@@ inter@@ net .
"The com@@ bin@@ ation of sp@@ in , on the one hand , and the Inter@@ net on the other ."
"So govern@@ ments from R@@ us@@ si@@ a to China to I@@ ran are actually hi@@ ring , tra@@ ining and pa@@ ying blo@@ gg@@ ers in order to leave ide@@ ologi@@ cal com@@ ments and create a lot of ide@@ ologi@@ cal blo@@ g po@@ sts to com@@ ment on sen@@ si@@ tive poli@@ tical issu@@ es . R@@ ight ?"
"So you may won@@ der , why on Earth are they doing it ?"
Why are they eng@@ ag@@ ing with cy@@ ber@@ space ?
Well my the@@ ory is that it &apos;s happening because cen@@ sor@@ ship actually is less effe@@ ctive than you think it is in many of those places .
"The moment you put something cri@@ tical in a blo@@ g , even if you man@@ age to b@@ an it im@@ medi@@ ately , it will still sp@@ read around thousands and thousands of other blo@@ gs ."
"So the more you blo@@ ck it , the more it em@@ b@@ ol@@ den@@ s people to actually av@@ o@@ id the cen@@ sor@@ ship and th@@ us wi@@ n in this cat@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ m@@ ou@@ se g@@ ame ."
"So the only way to control this mess@@ age is actually to try to sp@@ in it and ac@@ c@@ use any@@ one who has wri@@ t@@ ten something cri@@ tical of being , for example , a C@@ I@@ A ag@@ ent ."
"And , again , this is happening quite often ."
"J@@ ust to give you an example of how it works in China , for example ."
"There was a big case in F@@ e@@ bru@@ ary 200@@ 9 called &quot; &quot; E@@ lu@@ de the C@@ at . &quot; &quot; And for those of you who didn &apos;t know , I &apos;ll just give a little sum@@ mar@@ y ."
"So what happened is that a 2@@ 4@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old man , a Chin@@ ese man , d@@ ied in pri@@ son cu@@ st@@ ody ."
"And poli@@ ce said that it happened because he was playing hi@@ de and se@@ ek , which is &quot; &quot; e@@ lu@@ de the c@@ at &quot; &quot; in Chin@@ ese s@@ lan@@ g , with other in@@ mat@@ es and h@@ it his head against the w@@ all , which was not an ex@@ plan@@ ation which s@@ at well with many Chin@@ ese blo@@ gg@@ ers ."
So they im@@ medi@@ ately began post@@ ing a lot of cri@@ tical com@@ ments .
"In fact , Q@@ Q@@ .@@ co@@ m , which is a popul@@ ar Chin@@ ese we@@ b@@ site , had 3@@ 5@@ ,000 com@@ ments on this issue within hours ."
But then au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ies did something very s@@ mar@@ t .
"In@@ ste@@ ad of trying to pur@@ ge these com@@ ments , they instead went and re@@ ach@@ ed out to the blo@@ gg@@ ers ."
"And they basically said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook guys . We &apos;d like you to become ne@@ ti@@ z@@ en inv@@ esti@@ gat@@ ors . &quot; &quot; So 500 people ap@@ pl@@ ied , and four were se@@ le@@ cted to actually go and t@@ our the fac@@ i@@ lity in question , and th@@ us in@@ spe@@ ct it and then blo@@ g about it ."
"Wi@@ th@@ in days the entire in@@ ci@@ dent was for@@ got@@ ten , which would have never happened if they simply tr@@ ied to blo@@ ck the cont@@ ent ."
Pe@@ ople would keep talking about it for weeks .
And this actually fi@@ ts with another interesting the@@ ory about what &apos;s happening in au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an st@@ ates and in their cy@@ ber@@ space .
"This is what poli@@ tical scienti@@ sts call au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an deli@@ ber@@ ation , and it happens when govern@@ ments are actually re@@ ach@@ ing out to their cri@@ ti@@ cs and le@@ tting them eng@@ age with each other on@@ line ."
"We ten@@ d to think that some@@ how this is going to har@@ m these di@@ ct@@ at@@ or@@ ships , but in many c@@ ases it only str@@ eng@@ th@@ ens them ."
And you may won@@ der why .
I &apos;ll just give you a very shor@@ t li@@ st of reas@@ ons why au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an deli@@ ber@@ ation may actually help the di@@ ct@@ at@@ ors .
And first it &apos;s quite simple .
Mo@@ st of them oper@@ ate in a comple@@ te information vac@@ u@@ um .
They don &apos;t really have the data they need in order to iden@@ ti@@ fy em@@ er@@ g@@ ing thre@@ ats fac@@ ing the regi@@ me .
"So en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing people to actually go on@@ line and share information and data on blo@@ gs and wi@@ k@@ is is great because o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , low level ap@@ par@@ at@@ chi@@ ks and bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ rat@@ s will contin@@ ue con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing what &apos;s actually happening in the country , right ?"
"So from this perspe@@ ctive , having blo@@ gs and wi@@ k@@ is produ@@ ce know@@ le@@ dge has been great ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , inv@@ ol@@ ving public in any deci@@ sion making is also great because it hel@@ ps you to share the bl@@ ame for the poli@@ cies which ev@@ en@@ tually fa@@ il ."
"Because they say , &quot; &quot; Well look , we asked you , we con@@ sul@@ ted you , you v@@ ot@@ ed on it ."
You put it on the front p@@ age of your blo@@ g .
"Well , great . You are the one who is to bl@@ ame . &quot; &quot; And finally , the pur@@ pos@@ e of any au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an deli@@ ber@@ ation ef@@ for@@ ts is usu@@ ally to incre@@ ase the le@@ gi@@ ti@@ m@@ acy of the regi@@ mes , both at home and ab@@ ro@@ ad ."
"So in@@ vi@@ ting people to all sor@@ ts of public for@@ um@@ s , having them parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in deci@@ sion making , it &apos;s actually great ."
"Because what happens is that then you can actually point to this ini@@ ti@@ ative and say , &quot; Well , we are having a de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y . We are having a for@@ um . &quot;"
"J@@ ust to give you an example , one of the R@@ us@@ si@@ an regi@@ ons , for example , now inv@@ ol@@ ves its ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens in plan@@ ning its strate@@ gy up until year 20@@ 20 ."
R@@ ight ? So they can go on@@ line and con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te ideas on what that regi@@ on would look like by the year 20@@ 20 .
"I mean , any@@ one who has been to R@@ us@@ si@@ a would know that there was no plan@@ ning in R@@ us@@ si@@ a for the next mon@@ th ."
"So having people inv@@ olved in plan@@ ning for 20@@ 20 is not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly going to change anything , because the di@@ ct@@ at@@ ors are still the ones who control the ag@@ en@@ da ."
"J@@ ust to give you an example from I@@ ran , we all heard about the T@@ wit@@ ter re@@ v@@ olution that happened there , but if you look close enough , you &apos;ll actually see that many of the net@@ works and blo@@ gs and T@@ wit@@ ter and F@@ ace@@ book were actually oper@@ ational ."
"They may have become s@@ low@@ er , but the acti@@ vi@@ sts could still ac@@ cess it and actually ar@@ gu@@ e that having ac@@ cess to them is actually great for many au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an st@@ ates ."
And it &apos;s great simply because they can ga@@ ther open source inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence .
"In the past it would take you weeks , if not months , to iden@@ ti@@ fy how I@@ rani@@ an acti@@ vi@@ sts conne@@ ct to each other ."
Now you actually know how they conne@@ ct to each other by looking at their F@@ ace@@ book p@@ age .
"I mean K@@ G@@ B , and not just K@@ G@@ B , used to tor@@ ture in order to actually get this data ."
Now it &apos;s all available on@@ line .
"( Laughter ) But I think the bi@@ ggest con@@ cep@@ tu@@ al pit@@ f@@ all that cy@@ ber@@ top@@ i@@ ans made is when it comes to di@@ gi@@ tal n@@ ati@@ ves , people who have grow@@ n up on@@ line ."
"We often hear about cy@@ ber acti@@ vi@@ sm , how people are getting more ac@@ tive because of the Inter@@ net ."
"R@@ are@@ ly hear about cy@@ ber he@@ d@@ on@@ is@@ m , for example , how people are be@@ coming pas@@ sive ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because they some@@ how as@@ su@@ me that the Inter@@ net is going to be the cat@@ al@@ y@@ st of change that will p@@ us@@ h young people into the stre@@ ets , while in fact it may actually be the new op@@ i@@ um for the mas@@ ses which will keep the same people in their ro@@ oms dow@@ n@@ lo@@ ading por@@ no@@ gra@@ ph@@ y ."
That &apos;s not an op@@ tion being consi@@ der@@ ed too stron@@ g@@ ly .
"So for every di@@ gi@@ tal r@@ ene@@ g@@ ade that is re@@ vol@@ ting in the stre@@ ets of T@@ e@@ h@@ ran , there may as well be two di@@ gi@@ tal cap@@ ti@@ ves who are actually re@@ be@@ l@@ ling only in the World of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft ."
And this is reali@@ stic . And there is nothing wrong about it because the Inter@@ net has gre@@ at@@ ly em@@ power@@ ed many of these young people and it pla@@ ys a completely different social ro@@ le for them .
"If you look at some of the sur@@ ve@@ ys on how the young people actually b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from the Inter@@ net , you &apos;ll see that the number of te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers in China , for example , for wh@@ om the Inter@@ net actually bro@@ ad@@ ens their se@@ x life , is three times more than in the United States ."
"So it does play a social ro@@ le , h@@ ow@@ ever it may not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly le@@ ad to poli@@ tical eng@@ ag@@ ement ."
"So the way I ten@@ d to think of it is like a h@@ ier@@ ar@@ chy of cy@@ ber@@ -@@ needs in space , a tot@@ al ri@@ p@@ -@@ off from A@@ bra@@ ha@@ m M@@ as@@ low ."
"But the point here is that when we get the re@@ mot@@ e R@@ us@@ si@@ an vi@@ ll@@ age on@@ line , what will get people to the Inter@@ net is not going to be the re@@ por@@ ts from H@@ um@@ an R@@ igh@@ ts W@@ at@@ ch ."
"It &apos;s going to be por@@ no@@ gra@@ ph@@ y , &quot; &quot; Se@@ x and the C@@ ity , &quot; &quot; or maybe wat@@ ching fun@@ ny vi@@ de@@ os of cat@@ s ."
So this is something you have to re@@ cogni@@ ze .
So what should we do about it ?
"Well I say we have to stop thinking about the number of i@@ Pod@@ s per ca@@ pi@@ ta and start thinking about ways in which we can em@@ power in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ als , dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents , N@@ G@@ O@@ s and then the mem@@ bers of ci@@ vi@@ l society ."
"Because even what has been happening up &apos; til now with the S@@ p@@ inter@@ net and au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an deli@@ ber@@ ation , there is a great ch@@ ance that those vo@@ i@@ ces will not be heard ."
So I think we should sh@@ at@@ ter some of our ut@@ op@@ i@@ an as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions and actually start doing something about it .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"A couple of years ago , H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ iness S@@ cho@@ ol cho@@ se the best business model of that year ."
"And I learned these two fac@@ ts , and I thought , what &apos;s going on in shi@@ pping ?"
"And I thought , would that happen in any other indu@@ stry ?"
W@@ ould we see 5@@ 4@@ 4 Gre@@ y@@ h@@ ound bu@@ s dri@@ ver@@ s ?
It wouldn &apos;t happen .
So I started to get in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed .
"And I disco@@ vered another fact , which to me was more ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing almost for the fact that I ha@@ dn &apos;t known it before at the age of 4@@ 2 , 4@@ 3 ."
That is how fundam@@ ent@@ ally we still de@@ p@@ end on shi@@ pping .
But shi@@ pping isn &apos;t that .
S@@ hi@@ pping br@@ ings us 90 percent of world tra@@ de .
S@@ hi@@ pping has qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ p@@ led in size since 19@@ 70 .
We are more depen@@ dent on it now than ever .
"And yet , for such an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous indu@@ stry — there are a 10@@ 0,000 working v@@ es@@ sel@@ s on the se@@ a — it &apos;s become pretty much in@@ visi@@ ble ."
"Now that sounds ab@@ sur@@ d in S@@ ing@@ apo@@ re to say that , because here shi@@ pping is so present that you stu@@ ck a ship on top of a hot@@ el ."
"( Laughter ) But el@@ se@@ where in the world , if you ask the gener@@ al public what they know about shi@@ pping and how much tra@@ de is car@@ ried by se@@ a , you will get essen@@ ti@@ ally a bl@@ ank face ."
You will ask someone on the stre@@ et if they &apos;ve heard of Mi@@ cro@@ so@@ ft .
"I should think they &apos;ll say y@@ es , because they &apos;ll know that they make so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that goes on compu@@ ters , and oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally works ."
"But if you ask them if they &apos;ve heard of Ma@@ er@@ sk , I d@@ ou@@ b@@ t you &apos;d get the same respon@@ se , even though Ma@@ er@@ sk , which is just one shi@@ pping company am@@ on@@ g@@ st many , has re@@ ven@@ u@@ es pretty much on a p@@ ar with Mi@@ cro@@ so@@ ft ."
&#91; $ 6@@ 0@@ .@@ 2 billion &#93; Now why is this ?
We are bl@@ ind to the se@@ a as a place of indu@@ stry or of work .
"It &apos;s just something we f@@ ly over , a pat@@ ch of blue on an air@@ line ma@@ p ."
"N@@ o@@ thing to see , move along ."
"So I wanted to open my own eyes to my own se@@ a b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness , so I ran away to se@@ a ."
"We tra@@ ve@@ led through five se@@ as , two oce@@ ans , n@@ ine por@@ ts , and I learned a lot about shi@@ pping ."
Now that &apos;s because shi@@ pping is very ef@@ fi@@ cient .
Con@@ tain@@ eri@@ z@@ ation has made it very ef@@ fi@@ cient .
S@@ hi@@ ps have au@@ tom@@ ation now .
They can oper@@ ate with small cre@@ ws .
So most se@@ af@@ ar@@ ers now working on con@@ tain@@ er ships often have less than two hours in port at a time .
They don &apos;t have time to re@@ la@@ x .
So that was a nor@@ mal working ship .
Now how is that possible ?
S@@ hi@@ ps can now f@@ ly the f@@ la@@ g of any n@@ ation that provi@@ des a f@@ la@@ g regi@@ stry .
"( Laughter ) So we have these very mul@@ t@@ in@@ ational , global , mo@@ bi@@ le cre@@ ws on ships ."
And that was a sur@@ pri@@ se to me .
"And when we got to pi@@ r@@ ate wat@@ ers , down the B@@ ab@@ -@@ el@@ -@@ M@@ an@@ de@@ b stra@@ it and into the Indi@@ an O@@ ce@@ an , the ship changed ."
We were no longer allow@@ ed on de@@ ck .
There were d@@ ou@@ ble pi@@ r@@ ate wat@@ ch@@ es .
What else does our se@@ a b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness mas@@ k ?
And shi@@ pping is the gre@@ en@@ est meth@@ od of transpor@@ t .
"But it &apos;s not b@@ eni@@ g@@ n , because there &apos;s so much of it ."
When are we going to start talking and thinking about shi@@ pping miles as well as air miles ?
"And in fact , shi@@ pping has a ro@@ le to play here , because shi@@ pping no@@ ise has con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted to dam@@ ag@@ ing the ac@@ ou@@ stic ha@@ bi@@ tat@@ s of ocean cre@@ at@@ ures ."
And a Nor@@ th At@@ lan@@ tic right wh@@ ale can trans@@ m@@ it across hundre@@ ds of miles .
A hum@@ p@@ back can trans@@ m@@ it a sound across a whole ocean .
But there are no l@@ aw@@ s gover@@ ning ac@@ ou@@ stic pol@@ lu@@ tion yet .
"And when I ar@@ ri@@ ved in S@@ ing@@ apo@@ re , and I apo@@ logi@@ ze for this , but I didn &apos;t want to get off my ship ."
I &apos;d really lo@@ ved being on bo@@ ard Ken@@ d@@ al .
"I &apos;d been well tre@@ ated by the cre@@ w , I &apos;d had a gar@@ ru@@ l@@ ous and en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ining cap@@ tain , and I would ha@@ p@@ pi@@ ly have sig@@ ned up for another five weeks , something that the cap@@ tain also said I was c@@ razy to think about ."
"But I wasn &apos;t there for n@@ ine months at a time like the F@@ i@@ li@@ p@@ in@@ o se@@ af@@ ar@@ ers , who , when I asked them to descri@@ be their job to me , called it &quot; &quot; dol@@ lar for h@@ ome@@ si@@ ck@@ ness . &quot; &quot; They had good s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies , but the@@ ir@@ s is still an is@@ ol@@ ating and difficult life in a d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous and often difficult ele@@ ment ."
"But I also want to see shi@@ pping , and us , the gener@@ al public , who know so little about it , to have a bit more sc@@ ru@@ t@@ iny , to be a bit more tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent , to have 90 percent tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy ."
"Because I think we could all b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from doing something very simple , which is lear@@ ning to see the se@@ a ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
My fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te top@@ ic is shor@@ t@@ cu@@ ts .
"The ma@@ ster of shor@@ t@@ cu@@ ts — it &apos;s , of course , nature ."
"But I will de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate different ways to get ri@@ d of difficul@@ ties and go to the point , to find an answer probably much quick@@ er than Ar@@ th@@ ur did .

"A@@ ll of you , right ? P@@ al@@ m up ."
"If you do this , the common , the logi@@ c says you must turn the wri@@ st ."
Do you ag@@ ree ?
Go@@ od .

"You can do it im@@ medi@@ ately , right ?"
"H@@ old the hand like this , pal@@ m up ."
"D@@ on &apos;t move the wri@@ st . The wri@@ st is — I doesn &apos;t speak very many , but I do the best , what I are ."
"R@@ igh@@ t-@@ mo@@ l@@ ded you say , with i@@ ro@@ n ?"

"F@@ or@@ ward , don &apos;t move the wri@@ st ."
"U@@ p , don &apos;t move the wri@@ st . O@@ ver the heart , don &apos;t move the wri@@ st ."
And forward . Yeah .
"Now — ( Laughter ) — logi@@ c , logi@@ cally , you have got to this posi@@ tion from this , without moving the wri@@ st . ( Laughter )"
"Now , the shor@@ t@@ cut . ( Laughter )"
But it was six mo@@ ves . Now with one move .
"I start here , pal@@ m down , you can fol@@ low ."
And then look at me .
Yeah ! ( Laughter ) One move . OK .
"So , that was the war@@ ming up ."
"Now , I need an as@@ si@@ st@@ ant ."
"I tal@@ ked to a nice girl before , Z@@ o@@ e ."
She has left . No ! A big hand .
( Applause ) Go@@ od . N@@ ice . And you can si@@ t over there .

And I will give my tri@@ bu@@ te to water .
I think it &apos;s enough with water for me . The other guys can talk about — che@@ ers .
( Laughter ) Be@@ er has about — there &apos;s a lot of water in be@@ er . ( Laughter )
"So , now I will de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate different ways of memor@@ i@@ z@@ ing , control car@@ ds and so on ."
And I think I &apos;ll take off this one .

"Now I will inter@@ act . So a different person all the time , so not the same person can answer ."
So we have an ag@@ re@@ ement .
Wh@@ ich one sh@@ all have a good po@@ k@@ er hand ?
"Wh@@ ich number ? One , two , three , four or five ? ( A@@ ud@@ ience : Th@@ ree . ) L@@ en@@ n@@ art Gre@@ en : Th@@ ree — good ."

( Laughter ) Wi@@ th qu@@ e@@ ens and — it &apos;s OK — qu@@ e@@ ens and ten@@ s .
That &apos;s a challen@@ ge . I like this .

I start with three qu@@ e@@ ens .
So here you see the con@@ tra@@ st when I tre@@ at the car@@ ds .
And two ten@@ s .
Yeah . Thank you .
"( Applause ) But also the other hand is good , if all the other guys have good h@@ ands too ."
So these guys have actually a stron@@ ger hand — three ac@@ es and two k@@ ings .

"No re@@ action ? That with even — OK , and this ."

"So here , I can make a be@@ t , and this is actually one of the poin@@ ts where I get my money ."
"So here : 10 , j@@ ack , qu@@ e@@ en , king , ace ."
OK .
( Applause ) N@@ ex@@ t is a ter@@ m — I do it qui@@ ck . I call this ste@@ al@@ ing .

Z@@ o@@ e : S@@ top .
L@@ G : Here — you see some are mis@@ sing ?
"And that &apos;s the ste@@ al@@ ing car@@ ds , which I did ."
( Laughter ) OK .
"Now , another ter@@ m called sh@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ le trac@@ king ."
"S@@ hu@@ f@@ f@@ le trac@@ king means I keep tr@@ ack of the car@@ ds , even if another person sh@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ les ."
This is a little ri@@ sk@@ y .
"So — because if you look , now , I can still see it ."
"You ag@@ ree ? But if you squ@@ are — squ@@ are , and sh@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ le , and then a cut ."
"So here , to fol@@ low my car@@ ds , I must look at the sh@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ le from the beg@@ in — ah , we are started together . It &apos;s OK , it &apos;s OK ."
"C@@ ome to — no , no , no , no ."
"I &apos;m jo@@ king , ye@@ ah ?"
"A@@ ny sty@@ le — ye@@ ah , good ."
"H@@ ere I have to cal@@ cul@@ ate , but actually , I don &apos;t like to cal@@ cul@@ ate ."
I work dire@@ ct with the right brain .

"D@@ i@@ re@@ ct in the right brain , that &apos;s much better . And so — ( Laughter ) — Ar@@ th@@ ur B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in did a little of the same thing ."

"Now , you can car@@ ry this in your wal@@ let , so ..."
"You don &apos;t see it , make no re@@ action ?"
"( Laughter ) So , but here , and — is the cam@@ era getting too much ? No . ( Laughter )"
"@@ Yeah ? ( A@@ ud@@ ience : It &apos;s getting too much . ) L@@ G : Par@@ don ? But then , when we will have it back , you do this ."
But not too much .
Th@@ en you have to p@@ us@@ h it down again .
"H@@ ere , ple@@ ase . If you p@@ us@@ h these he@@ ap@@ s — everyone see — p@@ us@@ h them together so they are really inter@@ l@@ ac@@ ed , right ? Yeah , good ."

"And then , I will de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate a thing from R@@ us@@ si@@ an s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te , ste@@ al@@ en — sto@@ le@@ n , probably cop@@ ied from America but we will see ."
Here — shor@@ t@@ cu@@ ts . I talk about shor@@ t@@ cu@@ ts .

"But you know , I think you are fami@@ li@@ ar with f@@ rac@@ tal@@ s — the M@@ an@@ de@@ l@@ bro@@ t sp@@ ir@@ als and all these things ."
"And it &apos;s much e@@ as@@ ier to memor@@ i@@ ze car@@ ds in a pat@@ ter@@ n way , and not con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate . If you con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate and cal@@ cul@@ ate , then you go to — then it &apos;s the left brain . But if you just look and talk in another language ..."
"@@ Yeah , great ."
I think I have it .
"So now , different per@@ s@@ ons , ol@@ der , ta@@ p ."
"P@@ le@@ ase name any car@@ d , any@@ one ."
( A@@ ud@@ ience : J@@ ack of sp@@ a@@ des . ) L@@ G : J@@ ack of sp@@ a@@ des . J@@ ack of sp@@ a@@ des .

"O@@ K . A@@ no@@ ther person . Oh , I for@@ got , I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t sh@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ le but I think — ( Laughter ) — actually , my techni@@ qu@@ e is to pe@@ ek , all the time ."

"( Applause ) OK , I had to use a little force there ."
I think we sa@@ ve five of clu@@ b@@ s .
And now a car@@ d with a con@@ tra@@ st of five of clu@@ b@@ s .
"( A@@ ud@@ ience : Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of hear@@ ts . ) L@@ G : Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of hear@@ ts , ye@@ ah ."
E@@ x@@ cel@@ l@@ ent . I love that car@@ d .
"H@@ ere , I will do the most difficult thing ."
"For example , you are sitting in L@@ as V@@ e@@ gas , and you &apos;re bet@@ ting , and you let the other guys pe@@ ek this car@@ d by mist@@ ake . F@@ e@@ el , it &apos;s just the regu@@ lar , one car@@ d ."
"And now , when I li@@ ft this car@@ d , it sh@@ all be your car@@ d . What was your car@@ d ?"
( A@@ ud@@ ience : Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of hear@@ ts . ) L@@ G : Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of ? Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of hear@@ ts .
"So that &apos;s a t@@ ough challen@@ ge , right ?"
"So here , I gra@@ b — you know this ? F@@ i@@ ve of clu@@ b@@ s ..."
and qu@@ e@@ en of hear@@ ts . Yes !
"This is a t@@ ough one , because here I must take adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of — I s@@ wit@@ ch it with the five of clu@@ b@@ s ."
"So , now a fal@@ se coun@@ t ."
Wh@@ ich car@@ d sh@@ all I use ? Q@@ u@@ e@@ en or five ?
"Z@@ o@@ e : The qu@@ e@@ en . L@@ G : Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , y@@ es ."
"So , I use the qu@@ e@@ en , and here &apos;s five of clu@@ b@@ s ."
"The fal@@ se coun@@ t — and the number one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight — you say the same car@@ d all the time ."
"E@@ ight , n@@ ine , 10 ."
"This is a kind of op@@ tical deal , right ?"
"When I put one car@@ d at a table — look , it &apos;s not one car@@ d . It &apos;s — look , it &apos;s a bu@@ n@@ ch of car@@ ds that gi@@ ves this im@@ pres@@ sion ."
Yeah .
Now some hard stuff .
"I think we keep the qu@@ e@@ en here , y@@ es ."
"Now , to the s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ tes things ."
"This — oh sor@@ ry , don &apos;t look at the be@@ am . My f@@ au@@ l@@ t ."
"( Laughter ) This is high-@@ fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy las@@ er , and it &apos;s enough with a f@@ rac@@ tion of a second to de@@ stro@@ y the re@@ t@@ ina completely ."
"R@@ ight , sor@@ ry , my — I should have men@@ tion@@ ed that , ye@@ ah ."
"But you can re@@ la@@ x , because it takes half an hour before it works , so you have pl@@ en@@ ty of time to see my whole perform@@ ance ."
"( Laughter ) Now , I put the las@@ er here , and — now , when I deal the car@@ ds in the las@@ er , I know where they are but — y@@ es ?"
D@@ id the cam@@ era got it ?
No ?
They didn &apos;t ?
What happened ?
"( A@@ ud@@ ience : It disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ared . ) L@@ G : OK , I &apos;ll take another group ."
Do the cam@@ er@@ as see the car@@ ds now ?
"No ? ( A@@ ud@@ ience : No , they &apos;re all gone . ) L@@ G : But you see the hand ."
"A@@ h , good , good , good . But now ."
"So now , that was the reason , right ?"
You see the car@@ ds ? Yes .
"( Laughter ) Yeah , good ."
"Now — ( Laughter ) — one guy l@@ augh@@ ed . So now , to find the qu@@ e@@ en , do it this way : take back the other one , take back the qu@@ e@@ en . ( Laughter )"
"@@ Yeah , interesting , but a little d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous . ( Laughter )"
"I li@@ ked it . Now , a little more difficult ."
"N@@ ame — any@@ one , name , ple@@ ase , any su@@ it ."
"( A@@ ud@@ ience : S@@ pa@@ des . ) L@@ G : S@@ pa@@ des ? S@@ pa@@ des , good ."
"So here , here I have to pe@@ ek , lots of car@@ ds ."
"I think there are lots of — I don &apos;t know how many — but 10 , 15 sp@@ a@@ des in a de@@ ck , at least , right ?"
"( Laughter ) So every time I li@@ ft the he@@ a@@ p , I pe@@ ek , right ."
Th@@ en I ar@@ r@@ ange them so I can get them qui@@ ck .
"P@@ er@@ fe@@ ct , ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent ."
"So I start with the ace — ye@@ ah , ace . A@@ h , ye@@ ah — sp@@ a@@ des ?"
"S@@ ame mist@@ ake as before , right ?"
So — I ar@@ r@@ ange the sp@@ a@@ des — the clu@@ b@@ s .
"I try to do this right here . F@@ ir@@ st , I take the sp@@ a@@ des ."
"You see , I don &apos;t work with pre@@ sti@@ ge , so always do mist@@ ak@@ es ."
It doesn &apos;t matter to me .
"And now and then , I get some ex@@ tra sym@@ pa@@ th@@ y poin@@ ts , right ?"
"One , two , three , four — y@@ es , the cam@@ era got it ? F@@ i@@ ve , six , seven , eight — ah — n@@ ine , 10 , the j@@ ack , j@@ ack of sp@@ a@@ des , qu@@ e@@ en of — I like that l@@ au@@ gh , ye@@ ah ! Go@@ od . Q@@ u@@ e@@ en ."
"( Laughter ) W@@ a@@ it , wa@@ it , wa@@ it — ple@@ ase take any car@@ d ."
"G@@ ra@@ b any one . Q@@ u@@ i@@ ck , qui@@ ck , good ."
And we s@@ wit@@ ch this to the king .
A@@ ce of di@@ am@@ on@@ ds .
"And now , look , ace of di@@ am@@ on@@ ds will gu@@ i@@ de ."
So I find ...
king of sp@@ a@@ des .
"There was the place . And here is king of sp@@ a@@ des , cor@@ re@@ ct ?"
Yeah ? OK .
"( Applause ) Now , a little more difficult thing ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe you think I have the car@@ ds in order already , so you help me to sh@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ le again ."
"A@@ no@@ ther su@@ it , ple@@ ase ."
( A@@ ud@@ ience : Ar@@ m@@ ani . ) L@@ G : Par@@ don ? ( A@@ ud@@ ience : Ar@@ m@@ ani . ) ( Laughter ) L@@ G : It was after the b@@ lin@@ d@@ f@@ old .
"I like this guy , ye@@ ah ."
"O@@ K . That should be my end effe@@ ct , but OK ."
Ar@@ m@@ ani — who said Ar@@ m@@ ani ? You ?
I dro@@ p the car@@ ds and you — which size ?
Wh@@ ich size ? It &apos;s a piece of c@@ ake . I like challen@@ ges . Wh@@ ich size ?
"( A@@ ud@@ ience : E@@ x@@ tra large . ) L@@ G : E@@ x@@ tra large , OK . S@@ ay stop . ( A@@ ud@@ ience : S@@ top . )"
"( Laughter ) L@@ G : Yeah , Ar@@ m@@ ani . OK ."

"A@@ no@@ ther su@@ it . ( A@@ ud@@ ience : D@@ i@@ am@@ on@@ ds . ) L@@ G : D@@ i@@ am@@ on@@ ds , perfe@@ ct ."
"So , in this case , I try to lo@@ cate di@@ am@@ on@@ ds . I look at the car@@ ds , and OK ."
We try . Yeah . You help me .
"If I dro@@ p the car@@ d face up , like this , you re@@ verse it . Z@@ o@@ e : OK ."
"L@@ G : OK , now ."
"D@@ o with both h@@ ands , and qui@@ ck . Yes , good , good ."
"( Laughter ) I think we have it now . Yeah , good , good ."
"So here , di@@ am@@ on@@ ds , hear@@ ts — no , di@@ am@@ on@@ ds . Go@@ od , good ."
S@@ top . Do you see the pat@@ ter@@ n ?
No ? Now ?
"@@ Yes , y@@ es , OK ."
I work with pat@@ ter@@ n .
"O@@ h sor@@ ry , I dro@@ pped one ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe it &apos;s important — ye@@ ah — n@@ ine of di@@ am@@ on@@ ds , OK ."
"So now — I always ask , why do I put myself in this posi@@ tion ?"
"I have to figure out so many ou@@ ts , when I mi@@ ss some car@@ ds , but I love it . So now , I will do it . I will try to find the di@@ am@@ on@@ ds , but I will do it the hard way ."
"It &apos;s too e@@ asy to do it right away , right ?"
I think I will do it ...
b@@ lin@@ d@@ fol@@ ded .
"A@@ t this di@@ stance , it works im@@ medi@@ ately ."
A@@ ar@@ gh !
( Laughter ) D@@ u@@ ct ta@@ pe .
"I look — sha@@ ke the car@@ ds , so I don &apos;t ."
"G@@ o a@@ head . Yeah , good . I like the em@@ pa@@ th@@ y ."
E@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y .
But it was — did you hear ?
"It was women &apos;s vo@@ ice . H@@ e@@ ar the guy — ye@@ ah , more , more , more ."
"( Laughter ) Yeah , good . Yeah ."
"You can take the no@@ stri@@ l too , because some guys think — ( Laughter ) — some guys think I can pe@@ ek through the no@@ stri@@ l , so do more . G@@ o , go ."
R@@ ight ? Go@@ od .
S@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied ?
"L@@ o@@ o@@ ks good , like B@@ at@@ man . O@@ w !"
"( Laughter ) No , with di@@ gni@@ ty and ele@@ g@@ ance , right ?"
"But I like her , ye@@ ah . I said , be a little t@@ ough ."
And it was OK . One more ?
The last .
OK .
All right .
"Now you must ag@@ ree that I &apos;m — I must re@@ ly on other sen@@ ses , right ?"
I work with vi@@ br@@ ation .
"So , what was the car@@ d ?"
"D@@ i@@ am@@ on@@ ds . A@@ h , I memor@@ i@@ zed hear@@ ts ."
So now I have to impro@@ vi@@ se again .
Ma@@ ybe I &apos;ll stand up . H@@ al@@ f .
D@@ i@@ am@@ on@@ ds — I &apos;ll start with ace of di@@ am@@ on@@ ds .
"J@@ ust ki@@ d@@ ding , war@@ ming up — king of hear@@ ts ."
"( Laughter ) And I give you a di@@ am@@ on@@ ds , so they — so you put them here , in a nice row , right . And you can see , ye@@ ah ? Go@@ od ."
"A@@ ce of di@@ am@@ on@@ ds , y@@ es ? Z@@ o@@ e : Yeah ."
L@@ G : Go@@ od . Go@@ od . T@@ wo — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you .
I never ever mi@@ ss two . This is interesting .
"A@@ l@@ ways I &apos;ve found two , but the wrong color . S@@ pa@@ des , sor@@ ry ."
"And the de@@ ck is a gi@@ ft to you after , so let the sk@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ cal@@ s here , in this , exam@@ ine them , right ? R@@ em@@ ind me . It &apos;s a gi@@ ft ."
"T@@ wo — and it was two of sp@@ a@@ des , right ?"
"S@@ or@@ ry , two of di@@ am@@ on@@ ds . I &apos;ll do it qui@@ ck now ."
Th@@ ree — three of di@@ am@@ on@@ ds . Yes !
"F@@ our — I like challen@@ ges , y@@ es ."
"@@ Yeah , good ."
Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : You &apos;re pe@@ e@@ king .
L@@ G : Par@@ don ?
CA : You &apos;re pe@@ e@@ king . You just got to — this is a re@@ qu@@ est from the l@@ ady in the back .
( Laughter ) O@@ kay .
T@@ ry that .
L@@ G : Yeah . Al@@ so list@@ en .
"O@@ K , now ."
This is maybe a little t@@ ough .
We will try .
Yes ? Go@@ od ?
"( Laughter ) OK . So , how many car@@ ds ? F@@ i@@ ve ? Z@@ o@@ e : F@@ our ."
L@@ G : F@@ our . Is five the next car@@ d ?
"Z@@ o@@ e : F@@ i@@ ve of di@@ am@@ on@@ ds , ye@@ ah ."
L@@ G : It &apos;s not here ? Z@@ o@@ e : It &apos;s not there .
L@@ G : Oh .
"So here , all the car@@ ds are face down — you ag@@ ree ? ( A@@ ud@@ ience : Yes . ) L@@ G : Yes ? You see that in the scre@@ en ?"
"And this is face up , and it &apos;s not at the bot@@ tom here ."
So next car@@ d will be — was it five ?
Z@@ o@@ e : F@@ i@@ ve . L@@ G : Yeah — I will re@@ verse it face up here .
Yes ? Z@@ o@@ e : Yeah .
L@@ G : S@@ i@@ x — six with the th@@ um@@ b .
S@@ even .
"@@ Yeah , I do this . I know where it is , because I pe@@ e@@ ked before and then I do this ."
R@@ ight ?
E@@ ight .
"If — and then n@@ ine , right ?"
Yeah .
"@@ Y@@ est@@ er@@ day — the day before y@@ est@@ er@@ day , I was in V@@ e@@ gas , and I used this actually ."
N@@ ine ? Yeah ? C@@ or@@ re@@ ct ?
"No ? Yes ! A@@ h , good , good ."
"T@@ en — once again , I love this J@@ on@@ ny W@@ a@@ y@@ ne move ."
Yeah . J@@ ack — you &#91; un@@ clear &#93; with J@@ ack ? J@@ ack
"@@ of di@@ am@@ on@@ ds , cor@@ re@@ ct ? ( A@@ ud@@ ience : No . ) L@@ G : Yes ?"
"And qu@@ e@@ en ! Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , with mis@@ dire@@ ction ."
M@@ is@@ dire@@ ction . ( Applause ) Yeah ?
"And then , king , after exactly five secon@@ ds ."
Yeah . F@@ i@@ ve . F@@ i@@ ve secon@@ ds .
"One , two , three , four — m@@ m@@ m !"
Ch@@ e@@ ck it .
Yes ?
CA : K@@ ing of di@@ am@@ on@@ ds . L@@ G : A@@ h !
Go@@ od . Oh .
"T@@ ou@@ ch me , feel — ah , ah , you know !"
"CA : L@@ ad@@ ies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , L@@ en@@ n@@ art Gre@@ en ! L@@ G : O@@ kay , th@@ ank you ."
"I &apos;d like to apo@@ logi@@ ze , first of all , to all of you because I have no form of Pow@@ er@@ Po@@ int pres@@ ent@@ ation ."
"So what I &apos;m going to do is , every now and again , I will make this g@@ est@@ ure , and in a moment of Pow@@ er@@ Po@@ int de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y , you can imagine what you &apos;d like to see ."
I do a radi@@ o show .
"The radi@@ o show is called &quot; &quot; The In@@ fini@@ te M@@ on@@ key C@@ age . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about science , it &apos;s about r@@ ati@@ on@@ ali@@ sm ."
"So ther@@ e@@ fore , we get a lot of com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts every single week — com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts inclu@@ ding one we get very often , which is to say the very ti@@ tle , &quot; &quot; In@@ fini@@ te M@@ on@@ key C@@ age , &quot; &quot; ce@@ le@@ br@@ ates the idea of vi@@ vi@@ se@@ ction ."
We have made it quite clear to these people that an in@@ fini@@ te mon@@ key c@@ age is ro@@ om@@ y .
"( Laughter ) We also had someone else who said , &quot; &quot; &apos; The In@@ fini@@ te M@@ on@@ key C@@ age &apos; idea is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous ."
A@@ n in@@ fini@@ te number of mon@@ ke@@ ys could never write the works of S@@ ha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are .
"We know this because they did an experim@@ ent . &quot; &quot; Yes , they gave 12 mon@@ ke@@ ys a ty@@ pew@@ ri@@ ter for a week , and after a week , they only used it as a ba@@ th@@ room ."
"( Laughter ) So the ma@@ in ele@@ ment though , the ma@@ in com@@ pla@@ int we get — and one that I find most wor@@ ry@@ ing — is that people say , &quot; &quot; Oh , why do you in@@ si@@ st on ru@@ ining the mag@@ ic ?"
"You bring in science , and it ru@@ ins the mag@@ ic . &quot; &quot; Now I &apos;m an ar@@ ts gra@@ du@@ ate ; I love my@@ th and mag@@ ic and ex@@ ist@@ enti@@ ali@@ sm and self-@@ lo@@ a@@ thing ."
That &apos;s what I do .
But I also don &apos;t understand how it does ru@@ in the mag@@ ic .
"A@@ ll of the mag@@ ic , I think , that may well be taken away by science is then re@@ plac@@ ed by something as wonderful ."
"A@@ stro@@ logy , for in@@ stance : like many r@@ ati@@ on@@ ali@@ sts , I &apos;m a P@@ i@@ sc@@ es ."
"( Laughter ) Now ast@@ ro@@ logy — we re@@ move the ban@@ al idea that your life could be pre@@ di@@ cted ; that you &apos;ll , per@@ haps today , me@@ et a lu@@ ck@@ y man who &apos;s we@@ aring a h@@ at ."
That is gone .
"But if we want to look at the sk@@ y and see pre@@ di@@ ctions , we still can ."
"We can see pre@@ di@@ ctions of gal@@ ax@@ ies form@@ ing , of gal@@ ax@@ ies col@@ li@@ ding into each other , of new solar systems ."
This is a wonderful thing .
"If the Su@@ n could one day — and in@@ de@@ ed the Earth , in fact — if the Earth could read its own ast@@ ro@@ logi@@ cal , ast@@ ron@@ omi@@ cal char@@ t , one day it would say , &quot; &quot; N@@ ot a good day for making pl@@ ans ."
"You &apos;ll been en@@ gu@@ l@@ f@@ ed by a red gi@@ ant . &quot; &quot; And that to me as well , that if you think I &apos;m wor@@ ried about lo@@ sing wor@@ l@@ ds , well M@@ any Wor@@ l@@ ds the@@ ory — one of the most beautiful , fas@@ cin@@ ating , sometimes terri@@ f@@ ying ideas from the qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m inter@@ pret@@ ation — is a wonderful thing ."
"That every person here , every deci@@ sion that you &apos;ve made today , every deci@@ sion you &apos;ve made in your life , you &apos;ve not really made that deci@@ sion , but in fact , every single per@@ mu@@ tation of those deci@@ sions is made , each one going off into a new universe ."
That is a wonderful idea .
"If you ever think that your life is ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh , always remember there &apos;s another you that &apos;s made much wor@@ se deci@@ sions than that ."
"( Laughter ) If you ever think , &quot; &quot; A@@ h , I want to end it all , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t end it all ."
"R@@ e@@ member that in the maj@@ ori@@ ty of uni@@ ver@@ ses , you don &apos;t even exi@@ st in the first place ."
"This to me , in its own str@@ ange way , is very , very comfor@@ ting ."
"Now re@@ in@@ car@@ n@@ ation , that &apos;s another thing gone — the af@@ ter@@ life ."
But it &apos;s not gone .
S@@ cien@@ ce actually says we will live fore@@ ver .
"Well , there is one provi@@ so ."
We won &apos;t actually live fore@@ ver . You won &apos;t live fore@@ ver .
"@@ Y@@ our con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness , the y@@ ou@@ -@@ ness of you , the me@@ -@@ ness of me — that gets this one go ."
"But every single thing that makes us , every at@@ om in us , has already created a my@@ ri@@ ad of different things and will go on to create a my@@ ri@@ ad of new things ."
We have been m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins and app@@ les and pul@@ s@@ ars and other people &apos;s k@@ ne@@ es .
"Wh@@ o know@@ s , maybe one of your at@@ oms was once Na@@ po@@ le@@ on &apos;s k@@ ne@@ e ."
That is a good thing .
"U@@ n@@ like the oc@@ cu@@ pan@@ ts of the universe , the universe itself is not wa@@ ste@@ ful ."
We are all tot@@ ally re@@ cy@@ cl@@ able .
"And when we die , we don &apos;t even have to be plac@@ ed in different ref@@ use s@@ ac@@ s ."
This is a wonderful thing .
"U@@ n@@ der@@ standing , to me , does not re@@ move the won@@ der and the jo@@ y ."
"For in@@ stance , my wi@@ fe could turn to me and she may say , &quot; Why do you love me ? &quot;"
"And I can with all hon@@ est@@ y look her in the ey@@ e and say , &quot; &quot; Because our ph@@ er@@ om@@ ones mat@@ ched our ol@@ fac@@ t@@ ory re@@ cep@@ t@@ ors . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Th@@ ough I &apos;ll probably also say something about her ha@@ ir and per@@ son@@ ality as well ."
And that is a wonderful thing there .
L@@ o@@ ve does not die because of that thing .
P@@ a@@ in doesn &apos;t go away either .
"This is a terri@@ ble thing , even though I understand pa@@ in ."
"If someone pun@@ ch@@ es me — and because of my per@@ son@@ ality , this is re@@ cent@@ ly a regu@@ lar oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ence — I understand where the pa@@ in comes from ."
It is basically mom@@ entu@@ m to energy where the f@@ our@@ -@@ ve@@ ctor is con@@ st@@ ant — that &apos;s what it is .
"But at no point can I re@@ act and go , &quot; H@@ a ! Is that the best mom@@ entu@@ m@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ energy f@@ our@@ th ve@@ ctor con@@ st@@ ant you &apos;ve got ? &quot;"
"No , I just sp@@ it out a to@@ ot@@ h ."
( Laughter ) And that is all of these different things — the love for my child .
I have a son . H@@ is name is Ar@@ ch@@ ie .
"I &apos;m very lu@@ ck@@ y , because he &apos;s better than all the other children ."
Now I know you don &apos;t think that .
"You may well have your own children and think , &quot; &quot; Oh no , my child &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the wonderful thing about ev@@ olution — the pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction to believe that our child is best ."
"Now in many ways , that &apos;s just a survi@@ v@@ al thing ."
"The fact we see here is the ve@@ hi@@ cle for our gen@@ es , and ther@@ e@@ fore we love it ."
But we don &apos;t noti@@ ce that bit ; we just un@@ con@@ di@@ tion@@ ally love .
That is a wonderful thing .
Th@@ ough I should say that my son is best and is better than your children .
I &apos;ve done some te@@ sts .
And all of these things to me give such jo@@ y and exci@@ tem@@ ent and won@@ der .
"E@@ ven qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m mechani@@ cs can give you an ex@@ c@@ use for bad hou@@ se@@ work , for in@@ stance ."
P@@ er@@ haps you &apos;ve been at home for a week on your own .
You house is in a terri@@ ble state .
Y@@ our part@@ ner is about to re@@ turn .
"You think , what should I do ?"
Do nothing .
"A@@ ll you have to do is , when she wal@@ ks in , using a qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m inter@@ pret@@ ation , say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sor@@ ry ."
"I stop@@ ped obser@@ ving the house for a moment , and when I started obser@@ ving again , everything had happened . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the stron@@ g an@@ th@@ ro@@ pi@@ c prin@@ ci@@ ple of vac@@ u@@ um@@ ing ."
"For me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing ."
E@@ ven on my jour@@ ney up here — the jo@@ y that I have on my jour@@ ney up here every single time .
"If you actually think , you re@@ move the my@@ th and there is still something wonderful ."
I &apos;m sitting on a tra@@ in .
"E@@ very time I bre@@ a@@ the in , I &apos;m bre@@ a@@ thing in a mi@@ lli@@ on-@@ bi@@ lli@@ on-@@ billion at@@ oms of o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en ."
I &apos;m sitting on a cha@@ ir .
"E@@ ven though I know the cha@@ ir is made of at@@ oms and ther@@ e@@ fore actually in many ways em@@ p@@ ty space , I find it comfor@@ table ."
"I look out the win@@ do@@ w , and I realize that every single time we stop and I look out that win@@ do@@ w , fra@@ med in that win@@ do@@ w , wh@@ er@@ ever we are , I am obser@@ ving more life than there is in the rest of the known universe be@@ y@@ ond the planet Earth ."
"If you go to the sa@@ far@@ i par@@ ks on S@@ atur@@ n or Ju@@ pi@@ ter , you will be disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ted ."
"And I realize I &apos;m obser@@ ving this with the brain , the human brain , the most comple@@ x thing in the known universe ."
"That , to me , is an incredible thing ."
"And do you know what , that might be enough ."
"S@@ te@@ ven W@@ e@@ in@@ ber@@ g , the N@@ obe@@ l l@@ au@@ re@@ ate , once said , &quot; &quot; The more the universe seem@@ s com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble , the more it seem@@ s poin@@ t@@ less . &quot; &quot; Now for some people , that seem@@ s to le@@ ad to an idea of ni@@ hi@@ li@@ sm ."
"But for me , it doesn &apos;t . That is a wonderful thing ."
I &apos;m gl@@ ad the universe is poin@@ t@@ less .
"It means if I get to the end of my life , the universe can &apos;t turn to me and go , &quot; &quot; What have you been doing , you i@@ di@@ ot ?"
That &apos;s not the point . &quot; &quot; I can make my own pur@@ pos@@ e .
You can make your own pur@@ pos@@ e .
"We have the individu@@ al power to go , &quot; &quot; This is what I want to do . &quot; &quot; And in a poin@@ t@@ less universe , that , to me , is a wonderful thing ."
I have cho@@ s@@ en to make sil@@ ly jo@@ k@@ es about qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m mechani@@ cs and the C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en inter@@ pret@@ ation .
"You , I imagine , can do much better things with your time ."
Thank you very much . Go@@ od@@ by@@ e .
( Applause )
"W@@ ow , what an hon@@ or . I always wonder@@ ed what this would feel like ."
"So eight years ago , I got the wor@@ st car@@ e@@ er ad@@ vice of my life ."
"I had a friend tell me , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about how much you like the work you &apos;re doing now ."
"It &apos;s all about just building your re@@ su@@ me . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d just come back from living in S@@ pa@@ in for a while , and I &apos;d jo@@ ined this F@@ or@@ tu@@ ne 500 company . I thought , &quot; &quot; This is fanta@@ stic ."
I don &apos;t know if any@@ one &apos;s ever felt that .
And I noti@@ ced pretty so@@ on after that that all the compe@@ ti@@ t@@ ors in our space had already au@@ tom@@ ated my job ro@@ le .
And this is right about when I got this s@@ age ad@@ vice to build up my re@@ su@@ me .
"Well , as I &apos;m trying to figure out what two@@ -@@ story win@@ do@@ w I &apos;m going to j@@ um@@ p out of and change things up , I read some al@@ together different ad@@ vice from W@@ ar@@ re@@ n Bu@@ f@@ fe@@ t@@ t , and he said , &quot; T@@ aking j@@ ob@@ s to build up your re@@ su@@ me is the same as sa@@ ving up se@@ x for old age . &quot;"
I wanted to have some ty@@ pe of impac@@ t . It didn &apos;t matter what it was .
And I found pretty quickly that I wasn &apos;t alone : it turns out that over 80 percent of the people around don &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y their work .
"I &apos;m gu@@ ess@@ ing this room is different , but that &apos;s the a@@ ver@@ age that De@@ lo@@ it@@ te has done with their stud@@ ies ."
"So I wanted to find out , what is it that se@@ ts these people a@@ part , the people who do the pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate , wor@@ l@@ d-@@ chang@@ ing work , that wa@@ ke up inspi@@ red every day , and then these people , the other 80 percent who le@@ ad these lives of qu@@ ie@@ t des@@ per@@ ation ."
"O@@ f the people I &apos;d si@@ t down with for lu@@ n@@ ch , 80 percent would qu@@ it their job within two months ."
"I was pro@@ u@@ d of this , and it wasn &apos;t that I had any spe@@ cial mag@@ ic ."
It was that I would ask one simple question .
"It was , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing the work that you &apos;re doing ? &quot; &quot; And so often their answer would be , &quot; Well , because somebody told me I &apos;m sup@@ posed to . &quot;"
"And I realized that so many people around us are clim@@ b@@ ing their way up this l@@ ad@@ der that someone tel@@ ls them to clim@@ b , and it en@@ ds up being le@@ an@@ ed up against the wrong w@@ all , or no w@@ all at all ."
"The more time I spent around these people and saw this problem , I thought , what if we could create a community , a place where people could feel like they be@@ lon@@ g@@ ed and that it was OK to do things differ@@ ently , to take the ro@@ ad less tra@@ ve@@ led , where that was en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed , and inspi@@ re people to change ?"
"And that later became what I now call Li@@ ve Y@@ our Le@@ g@@ end , which I &apos;ll expla@@ in in a little bit ."
But you &apos;re doing work that em@@ bod@@ ies who you are .
"I want to share those three with you , so we can use them as a len@@ s for the rest of today and hop@@ e@@ fully the rest of our life ."
"The first part of this thre@@ e-@@ ste@@ p pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate work fra@@ me@@ work is be@@ coming a self-@@ exper@@ t and under@@ standing yourself , because if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for , you &apos;re never going to find it ."
And the thing is that no one is going to do this for us .
There &apos;s no major in uni@@ versity on pas@@ sion and pur@@ pos@@ e and car@@ e@@ er .
"I mean , you spend more time pi@@ c@@ king out a d@@ or@@ m room T@@ V set than you do you pi@@ c@@ king your major and your area of study ."
"But the point is , it &apos;s on us to figure that out , and we need a fra@@ me@@ work , we need a way to na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate through this ."
And so the first ste@@ p of our comp@@ as@@ s is fin@@ ding out what our uni@@ qu@@ e str@@ eng@@ ths are .
"What are the things that we wa@@ ke up lo@@ ving to do no matter what , whether we &apos;re pa@@ id or we &apos;re not pa@@ id , the things that people th@@ ank us for ?"
And the S@@ tr@@ eng@@ ths F@@ in@@ der 2@@ .@@ 0 is a book and also an on@@ line to@@ ol .
I high@@ ly re@@ comm@@ end it for sor@@ ting out what it is that you &apos;re natur@@ ally good at .
"And next , what &apos;s our fra@@ me@@ work or our h@@ ier@@ ar@@ chy for making deci@@ sions ?"
"D@@ o we care about the people , our family , health , or is it ach@@ ie@@ v@@ ement , suc@@ cess , all this stuff ?"
"We have to figure out what it is to make these deci@@ sions , so we know what our s@@ ou@@ l is made of , so that we don &apos;t go sel@@ ling it to some cause we don &apos;t give a sh@@ it about ."
And then the next ste@@ p is our exper@@ ien@@ ces .
"And if we don &apos;t spend time pa@@ ying at@@ ten@@ tion to that and as@@ si@@ mi@@ lat@@ ing that lear@@ ning and ap@@ pl@@ ying it to the rest of our lives , it &apos;s all for nothing ."
"E@@ very day , every week , every mon@@ th of every year I spend some time just ref@@ le@@ cting on what went right , what went wrong , and what do I want to re@@ pe@@ at , what can I app@@ ly more to my life ."
Why are you saying that ? O@@ p@@ en up a jour@@ na@@ l .
"Because when we start to put these things together , we can then def@@ ine what suc@@ cess actually means to us , and without these different par@@ ts of the comp@@ as@@ s , it &apos;s im@@ possible ."
We end up in the situ@@ ation — we have that sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ted life that everybody seem@@ s to be living going up this l@@ ad@@ der to now@@ here .
"It &apos;s kind of like in W@@ all St@@ re@@ et 2 , if any@@ body saw that , the pe@@ on em@@ plo@@ ye@@ e as@@ ks the big W@@ all St@@ re@@ et ban@@ k@@ er C@@ E@@ O , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s your number ? E@@ very@@ one &apos;s got a number , where if they make this money , they &apos;ll leave it all . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s simple . M@@ ore . &quot; &quot; And he just s@@ miles ."
"But once we have this fra@@ me@@ work together , we can start to iden@@ ti@@ fy the things that make us come ali@@ ve ."
"You know , before this , a pas@@ sion could come and h@@ it you in the face , or maybe in your possible line of work , you might th@@ row it away because you don &apos;t have a way of iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ying it ."
"But once you do , you can see something that &apos;s con@@ gru@@ ent with my str@@ eng@@ ths , my val@@ u@@ es , who I am as a person , so I &apos;m going to gra@@ b a@@ h@@ old of this , I &apos;m going to do something with it , and I &apos;m going to pur@@ su@@ e it and try to make an impac@@ t with it ."
"And Li@@ ve Y@@ our Le@@ g@@ end and the movement we &apos;ve built wouldn &apos;t exi@@ st if I didn &apos;t have this comp@@ as@@ s to iden@@ ti@@ fy , &quot; W@@ ow , this is something I want to pur@@ su@@ e and make a difference with . &quot;"
"One is they tell themselves they can &apos;t do them , or people around them tell them they can &apos;t do them ."
"E@@ i@@ ther way , we start to believe it ."
"The things is , everyone was im@@ possible until somebody did it ."
And then what happened ?
"T@@ wo months later , 16 people bro@@ ke the f@@ our@@ -@@ minu@@ te mi@@ le ."
And I &apos;ve actually got@@ ten into the ha@@ bit of this a little bit with my friends .
"We have this little group . We go on physi@@ cal ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ res , and re@@ cent@@ ly , I found myself in a kind of pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous spo@@ t ."
"I &apos;m terri@@ f@@ ied of de@@ ep , dar@@ k , blue water ."
"But anything ab@@ o@@ ve here , if it &apos;s mu@@ r@@ k@@ y , I can already feel it right now ."
I s@@ we@@ ar there &apos;s something in there .
"E@@ ven if it &apos;s L@@ ake T@@ a@@ ho@@ e , it &apos;s fre@@ sh water , tot@@ ally un@@ f@@ oun@@ ded fe@@ ar , ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , but it &apos;s there ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , three years ago I find myself on this tu@@ g@@ boat right down here in the S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co B@@ ay ."
"It &apos;s a ra@@ iny , stor@@ my , win@@ dy day , and people are getting si@@ ck on the boat , and I &apos;m sitting there we@@ aring a we@@ t@@ su@@ it , and I &apos;m looking out the win@@ do@@ w in pu@@ re ter@@ ro@@ r thinking I &apos;m about to s@@ wi@@ m to my death ."
I &apos;m going to try to s@@ wi@@ m across the G@@ ol@@ den G@@ ate .
And my gu@@ ess is some people in this room might have done that before .
"I &apos;m sitting there , and my bud@@ dy J@@ on@@ a@@ than , who had tal@@ ked me into it , he comes up to me and he could see the state I was in ."
"And he says , &quot; &quot; S@@ c@@ ot@@ t , h@@ ey man , what &apos;s the wor@@ st that could happen ?"
You &apos;re we@@ aring a we@@ t@@ su@@ it . You &apos;re not going to sin@@ k .
"And If you can &apos;t make it , just ho@@ p on one of the 20 ka@@ y@@ ak@@ s ."
"P@@ lu@@ s , if there &apos;s a sh@@ ar@@ k att@@ ack , why are they going to pi@@ ck you over the 80 people in the water ? &quot; &quot; So th@@ an@@ ks , that hel@@ ps ."
"T@@ ur@@ ns out , the pe@@ p talk tot@@ ally worked , and I felt this tot@@ al feeling of cal@@ m , and I think it was because J@@ on@@ a@@ than was 1@@ 3 years old ."
"( Laughter ) And of the 80 people s@@ wi@@ m@@ ming that day , 6@@ 5 of them were between the ages of n@@ ine and 1@@ 3 ."
Th@@ in@@ k how you would have appro@@ ach@@ ed your world differ@@ ently if at n@@ ine years old you found out you could s@@ wi@@ m a mi@@ le and a half in 5@@ 6@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e water from Al@@ cat@@ raz to S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co .
What would you have said y@@ es to ?
What would you have not given up on ? What would you have tr@@ ied ?
"As I &apos;m fini@@ sh@@ ing this s@@ wi@@ m , I get to A@@ qu@@ atic Par@@ k , and I &apos;m getting out of the water and of course half the kids are already fini@@ shed , so they &apos;re che@@ ering me on and they &apos;re all exci@@ ted ."
"And I got tot@@ al po@@ p@@ si@@ cle head , if any@@ one &apos;s ever s@@ wam in the B@@ ay , and I &apos;m trying to just th@@ a@@ w my face out , and I &apos;m wat@@ ching people fin@@ is@@ h ."
"And I see this one kid , something didn &apos;t look right ."
And he &apos;s just f@@ la@@ il@@ ing like this .
And he &apos;s bar@@ ely able to si@@ p some air before he sl@@ am@@ s his head back down .
"And I noti@@ ce other parents were wat@@ ching too , and I s@@ we@@ ar they were thinking the same thing I was : this is why you don &apos;t let n@@ in@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds s@@ wi@@ m from Al@@ cat@@ raz ."
This was not f@@ ati@@ gu@@ e .
"A@@ ll of a sud@@ den , two parents run up and gra@@ b him , and they put him on their sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders , and they &apos;re dra@@ gg@@ ing him like this , tot@@ ally lim@@ p ."
And then all of a sud@@ den they walk a few more fe@@ et and they plo@@ p him down in his whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir .
And he pu@@ ts his fi@@ sts up in the most in@@ s@@ ane show of vi@@ ct@@ ory I &apos;ve ever seen .
I can still feel the war@@ m@@ th and the energy on this guy when he made this ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment .
I had seen him ear@@ lie@@ r that day in his whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir .
I just had no idea he was going to s@@ wi@@ m .
"I mean , where is he going to be in 20 years ?"
"H@@ ow many people told him he couldn &apos;t do that , that he would die if tr@@ ied that ?"
The f@@ ast@@ est things to do things you don &apos;t think can be done is to sur@@ round yourself with people already doing them .
There &apos;s this quot@@ e by J@@ im Ro@@ h@@ n and it says .
&quot; You are the a@@ ver@@ age of the five people you spend the most time with . &quot;
And there is no bi@@ g@@ ger li@@ fe@@ h@@ ack in the history of the world from getting where you are today to where you want to be than the people you cho@@ ose to put in your cor@@ ner .
"They change everything , and it &apos;s a pro@@ ven fact ."
"In 1@@ 8@@ 9@@ 8 , Nor@@ man T@@ ri@@ ple@@ t@@ t did this study with a bu@@ n@@ ch of cy@@ cli@@ sts , and he would meas@@ ure their times around the tr@@ ack in a group , and also individu@@ ally ."
And he found that every time the cy@@ cli@@ sts in the group would cy@@ cle f@@ ast@@ er .
"And it &apos;s been re@@ pe@@ ated in all kinds of wal@@ ks of life since then , and it pro@@ ves the same thing over again , that the people around you matter , and environment is everything ."
"I found myself in this situ@@ ation — per@@ s@@ onal example , a couple years ago ."
"H@@ as any@@ one ever had a h@@ ob@@ by or a pas@@ sion they po@@ u@@ red their heart and s@@ ou@@ l into , un@@ belie@@ v@@ able amount of time , and they so bad@@ ly want to call it a business , but no one &apos;s pa@@ ying at@@ ten@@ tion and it doesn &apos;t make a di@@ me ?"
"O@@ K , I was there for four years trying to build this Li@@ ve Y@@ our Le@@ g@@ end movement to help people do work that they gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely car@@ ed about and that inspi@@ red them , and I was doing all I could , and there were only three people pa@@ ying at@@ ten@@ tion , and they &apos;re all right there : my mother , father and my wi@@ fe , Ch@@ el@@ se@@ a ."
Thank you guys for the sup@@ port .
"( Applause ) And this is how bad@@ ly I wanted it , it gre@@ w at zer@@ o percent for four years , and I was about to sh@@ u@@ t it down , and right about then , I mo@@ ved to S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co and started to me@@ et some pretty interesting people who had these c@@ razy li@@ fe@@ sty@@ les of ad@@ ven@@ ture , of bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es and we@@ b@@ si@@ tes and blo@@ gs that sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded their pas@@ sions and hel@@ ped people in a me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful way ."
"And one of my friends , now , he has a family of eight , and he sup@@ por@@ ts his whole family with a blo@@ g that he wri@@ tes for t@@ wi@@ ce a week ."
"They just came back from a mon@@ th in Europ@@ e , all of them together ."
This b@@ le@@ w my mind . How does this even exi@@ st ?
"And I got un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably inspi@@ red by seeing this , and instead of sh@@ u@@ tting it down , I decided , let &apos;s take it seri@@ ously ."
"And I did everything I could to spend my time , every wa@@ king hour possible trying to h@@ ound these guys , h@@ ang@@ ing out and having be@@ ers and wor@@ k@@ ou@@ ts , whatever it was ."
"And after four years of zer@@ o grow@@ th , within six months of h@@ ang@@ ing around these people , the community at Li@@ ve Y@@ our Le@@ g@@ end gre@@ w by 10 times ."
"In another 12 months , it gre@@ w by 1@@ 60 times ."
"And today over 3@@ 0,000 people from 1@@ 5@@ 8 countries use our car@@ e@@ er and conne@@ ction to@@ ols on a mon@@ th@@ ly basi@@ s ."
And those people have made up that community of pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate fol@@ ks who inspi@@ red that possi@@ bility that I dre@@ am@@ ed of for Li@@ ve Y@@ our Le@@ g@@ end so many years back .
"The people change everything , and this is why — you know , you ask what was going on ."
"Well , for four years , I knew no@@ body in this space , and I didn &apos;t even know it ex@@ ist@@ ed , that people could do this stuff , that you could have mov@@ em@@ ents like this ."
"And then I &apos;m over here in S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co , and everyone around me was doing it ."
You don &apos;t need to change your go@@ als . You just need to change your sur@@ ro@@ un@@ dings .
Because this is the group of people that inspi@@ res possi@@ bility .
We have a whole day to spend together and pl@@ en@@ ty more .
"To su@@ m things up , in terms of these three pi@@ l@@ lars , they all have one thing in common more than anything else ."
They are 100 percent in our control .
No one can tell you you can &apos;t learn about yourself .
No one can tell you you can &apos;t p@@ us@@ h your li@@ mi@@ ts and learn your own im@@ possible and p@@ us@@ h that .
No one can tell you you can &apos;t sur@@ round yourself with in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing people or get away from the people who bring you down .
You can &apos;t control a re@@ ces@@ sion .
You can &apos;t control getting fi@@ red or getting in a car ac@@ ci@@ dent .
Mo@@ st things are tot@@ ally out of our h@@ ands .
"These three things are tot@@ ally on us , and they can change our whole world if we deci@@ de to do something about it ."
"And the thing is , it &apos;s star@@ ting to happen on a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad level ."
"They thought this was an an@@ om@@ al@@ y , but it &apos;s happened three months stra@@ ight ."
"And the thing is , people are wa@@ king up to this possi@@ bility , that really the only thing that li@@ mi@@ ts possi@@ bility now is imag@@ in@@ ation ."
That &apos;s not a cli@@ ch@@ é any@@ more .
"I don &apos;t care what it is that you &apos;re into , what pas@@ sion , what h@@ ob@@ by ."
"If you &apos;re into k@@ ni@@ tting , you can find someone who is kil@@ ling it k@@ ni@@ tting , and you can learn from them . It &apos;s wi@@ ld ."
"And that &apos;s what this whole day is about , to learn from the fol@@ ks spe@@ aking , and we pro@@ fi@@ le these people on Li@@ ve Y@@ our Le@@ g@@ end every day , because when ordin@@ ary people are doing the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary , and we can be around that , it be@@ comes nor@@ mal ."
"And this isn &apos;t about being G@@ and@@ h@@ i or Ste@@ ve J@@ ob@@ s , doing something c@@ razy ."
"It &apos;s just about doing something that mat@@ ters to you , and makes an impac@@ t that only you can make ."
And he has this quot@@ e that I absolu@@ tely live by .
"You can either h@@ an@@ g around the people who tell you it can &apos;t be done and tell you you &apos;re stu@@ pi@@ d for trying , or sur@@ round yourself with the people who inspi@@ re possi@@ bility , the people who are in this room ."
Because I see it as our respon@@ si@@ bility to show the world that what &apos;s seen as im@@ possible can become that new nor@@ mal .
And that &apos;s already star@@ ting to happen .
"F@@ ir@@ st , do the things that inspi@@ re us , so we can inspi@@ re other people to do the things that inspi@@ re them ."
But we can &apos;t find that un@@ less we know what we &apos;re looking for .
"We have to do our work on our@@ self , be inten@@ ti@@ onal about that , and make those disco@@ ver@@ ies ."
Because I imagine a world where 80 percent of people love the work they do .
What would that look like ?
What would the in@@ no@@ vation be like ? How would you tre@@ at the people around you ?
Th@@ ings would start to change .
"And as we fin@@ is@@ h up , I have just one question to ask you guys , and I think it &apos;s the only question that mat@@ ters ."
And it &apos;s what is the work you can &apos;t not do ?
"D@@ is@@ co@@ ver that , live it , not just for you , but for everybody around you , because that is what star@@ ts to change the world ."
What is the work you can &apos;t not do ?
Thank you guys .
( Applause )
Go@@ od morning .
"When I was a little bo@@ y , I had an experience that changed my life , and is in fact why I &apos;m here today ."
"That one moment prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly af@@ fe@@ cted how I think about art , design and engine@@ ering ."
"As back@@ ground , I was for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate enough to gro@@ w up in a family of lo@@ ving and tal@@ en@@ ted arti@@ sts in one of the world &apos;s great cities ."
"My d@@ ad , Joh@@ n F@@ er@@ re@@ n , who d@@ ied when I was 15 , was an arti@@ st by both pas@@ sion and prof@@ es@@ sion , as is my mo@@ m , R@@ a@@ e ."
"I@@ sn &apos;t it re@@ mark@@ able that , after thousands of years of people doing mo@@ st@@ ly re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ational art , that moder@@ n art , com@@ par@@ ati@@ vely spe@@ aking , is about 15 minutes old , yet now per@@ v@@ a@@ sive ."
"In our home , art was every@@ where ."
"It was like o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en , around us and ne@@ cess@@ ary for life ."
"I had no inter@@ est in be@@ coming an arti@@ st , cer@@ tain@@ ly not a pain@@ ter ."
"I did this for hours every day , ap@@ par@@ ently av@@ o@@ i@@ ding ele@@ c@@ tro@@ cu@@ tion ."
Li@@ fe was good .
"Th@@ en , when I was about n@@ ine years old , we went to R@@ ome ."
"It didn &apos;t look all that spe@@ cial from the outside , as I said , but when we wal@@ ked inside , I was im@@ medi@@ ately stru@@ ck by three things : F@@ ir@@ st of all , it was ple@@ as@@ an@@ tly cool des@@ pi@@ te the op@@ pres@@ sive he@@ at outside ."
"It was very dar@@ k , the only source of light being an big open ho@@ le in the ro@@ of ."
"And there was something about this place , I didn &apos;t know why , that just felt spe@@ cial ."
"As we wal@@ ked to the cen@@ ter of the room , I looked up at the he@@ av@@ ens through the o@@ cu@@ lu@@ s ."
This was the first ch@@ ur@@ ch that I &apos;d been to that provi@@ ded an un@@ re@@ stri@@ cted view between God and man .
"But I wonder@@ ed , what about when it ra@@ ined ?"
"D@@ ad may have called this an o@@ cu@@ lu@@ s , but it was , in fact , a big ho@@ le in the ro@@ of ."
"No big deal here , just the same stat@@ u@@ ary stuff that we &apos;d seen all over R@@ ome ."
It looked like a Bu@@ ck@@ min@@ ster F@@ ul@@ ler ge@@ o@@ de@@ si@@ c dom@@ e .
"I &apos;d seen these before , and Bu@@ ck@@ y was friends with my d@@ ad ."
I lo@@ ved this place .
"He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the ori@@ gin@@ al ro@@ of . &quot; &quot; That moment changed my life , and I can remember it as if it were y@@ est@@ er@@ day ."
"For the first time , I realized people were s@@ mar@@ t 2@@ ,000 years ago . ( Laughter ) This had never cro@@ s@@ sed my mind ."
"I mean , to me , the py@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds at G@@ i@@ za , we visi@@ ted those the year before , and sure they &apos;re im@@ pres@@ sive , nice enough design , but look , give me an un@@ li@@ mi@@ ted bud@@ get , 20@@ ,000 to 4@@ 0,000 labor@@ ers , and about 10 to 20 years to cut and dra@@ g st@@ one blo@@ cks across the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , and I &apos;ll build you py@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds too ."
"But no amount of bru@@ te force gets you the dom@@ e of the P@@ an@@ the@@ on , not 2@@ ,000 years ago , no@@ r today ."
"And in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , it is still the largest un@@ re@@ in@@ for@@ ced con@@ cre@@ te dom@@ e that &apos;s ever been built ."
To build the P@@ an@@ the@@ on took some mi@@ rac@@ les .
"B@@ y mi@@ rac@@ les , I mean things that are techni@@ cally bar@@ ely possible , very high-@@ ri@@ sk , and might not be actually ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sha@@ ble at this moment in time , cer@@ tain@@ ly not by you ."
"For example , here are some of the P@@ an@@ the@@ on &apos;s mi@@ rac@@ les ."
"To make it even stru@@ c@@ tur@@ ally possible , they had to inv@@ ent super@@ -@@ stron@@ g con@@ cre@@ te , and to control we@@ ight , v@@ ar@@ ied the den@@ sity of the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate as they worked their way up the dom@@ e ."
I disco@@ vered for the first time that light itself has sub@@ stance .
"I realized , when com@@ b@@ ined , you could create things that were amazing that couldn &apos;t be done in either dom@@ a@@ in alone ."
My teach@@ ers told me that I had to get seri@@ ous and fo@@ cus on one or the other .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , ur@@ g@@ ing me to speci@@ ali@@ ze only ca@@ used me to really ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate those po@@ ly@@ ma@@ ths like Mi@@ ch@@ el@@ ang@@ el@@ o , Le@@ on@@ ar@@ do da V@@ in@@ ci , B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in Fran@@ kli@@ n , people who did exactly the op@@ posi@@ te ."
And this led me to em@@ brac@@ e and want to be in both wor@@ l@@ ds .
"S@@ ome@@ one themselves , per@@ haps H@@ ad@@ ri@@ an , needed a bri@@ lli@@ ant cre@@ ative vision ."
It is my belie@@ f that to create these r@@ are g@@ ame chang@@ ers requi@@ res you to pu@@ ll off at least five mi@@ rac@@ les .
"The problem is , no matter how tal@@ en@@ ted , ri@@ ch or s@@ mar@@ t you are , you only get one to one and a half mi@@ rac@@ les ."
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the quot@@ a .
"Th@@ en you run out of time , money , en@@ th@@ usi@@ as@@ m , whatever ."
T@@ ake the o@@ cu@@ lu@@ s of the P@@ an@@ the@@ on .
N@@ ot bad .
En@@ ough an@@ cient history .
"Well , pu@@ tting a man on the mo@@ on was a good one , and re@@ tur@@ ning him sa@@ fe@@ ly to Earth wasn &apos;t bad either ."
So what came after the mo@@ on ?
The Inter@@ net isn &apos;t a P@@ an@@ the@@ on .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , just as the technology of con@@ cre@@ te was cri@@ tical in realiz@@ ation of the P@@ an@@ the@@ on , new desig@@ n@@ ers will use the technolog@@ ies of the Inter@@ net to create no@@ vel con@@ cep@@ ts that will en@@ du@@ re ."
The s@@ mart@@ phone is a perfe@@ ct example .
So what &apos;s next ?
What im@@ min@@ ent adv@@ ance will be the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of the P@@ an@@ the@@ on ?
"It is a different kind of language , like art ."
"These other vi@@ tal con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions that ex@@ ten@@ d life and re@@ lie@@ ve su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing are , of course , cri@@ tical , and fanta@@ stic , but they &apos;re part of the contin@@ u@@ um of our over@@ all know@@ le@@ dge and technology , like the Inter@@ net ."
So what is next ?
"P@@ er@@ haps coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ ti@@ vely , I &apos;m gu@@ ess@@ ing it &apos;s a visi@@ on@@ ary idea from the l@@ ate 19@@ 3@@ 0s that &apos;s been re@@ vi@@ ved every dec@@ ade since : au@@ ton@@ om@@ ous ve@@ hi@@ cles ."
"Now you &apos;re thinking , give me a bre@@ ak ."
How can a fan@@ cy ver@@ sion of c@@ ru@@ ise control be pro@@ found ?
"A@@ l@@ though per@@ haps not obvi@@ ous today , au@@ ton@@ om@@ ous ve@@ hi@@ cles will be the key technology that en@@ ab@@ les us to re@@ design our cities and , by ex@@ ten@@ sion , ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s why : O@@ n@@ ce they become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous , each year , these ve@@ hi@@ cles will sa@@ ve ten@@ s of thousands of lives in the United States alone and a million glob@@ ally ."
A@@ ut@@ om@@ oti@@ ve energy con@@ sum@@ ption and air pol@@ lu@@ tion will be cut dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally .
Mu@@ ch of the ro@@ ad con@@ g@@ esti@@ on in and out of our cities will disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar .
"They will en@@ able compe@@ l@@ ling new con@@ cep@@ ts in how we design cities , work , and the way we live ."
But why now ? Why do we think this is ready ?
"It took fol@@ ks like D@@ A@@ R@@ P@@ A , uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties , and comp@@ an@@ ies completely outside of the au@@ tom@@ oti@@ ve indu@@ stry to noti@@ ce that if you were cle@@ ver about it , au@@ ton@@ om@@ y could be done now ."
So what are the five mi@@ rac@@ les needed for au@@ ton@@ om@@ ous ve@@ hi@@ cles ?
"One , you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is ."
"You need to know where all the ro@@ ads are , what the ru@@ les are , and where you &apos;re going ."

L@@ ast year saw 9@@ 9@@ 7 billion dollars in cor@@ por@@ ate fra@@ u@@ d alone in the United States .
De@@ cep@@ tion can cost bi@@ llions .
"Th@@ in@@ k En@@ ro@@ n , M@@ ad@@ off , the mor@@ t@@ g@@ age cri@@ sis ."

"Now gran@@ ted , many of those are white l@@ ies ."
"But in another study , it show@@ ed that str@@ ang@@ ers lie@@ d three times within the first 10 minutes of me@@ e@@ ting each other ."
We can &apos;t believe how pre@@ val@@ ent l@@ ying is .
We &apos;re essen@@ ti@@ ally against l@@ ying .
"But if you look more clo@@ se@@ ly , the p@@ lot actually thi@@ ck@@ ens ."
We lie more to str@@ ang@@ ers than we lie to c@@ ow@@ or@@ k@@ ers .
E@@ x@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts lie more than in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts .
M@@ en lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people .
W@@ om@@ en lie more to prote@@ ct other people .
"If you &apos;re an a@@ ver@@ age mar@@ ried couple , you &apos;re going to lie to your spo@@ use in one out of every 10 inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
"Now , you may think that &apos;s bad ."

"We say &quot; &quot; y@@ es , &quot; &quot; we sha@@ ke our he@@ ads &quot; &quot; no . &quot; &quot; We tell very con@@ v@@ in@@ cing stories , we sli@@ gh@@ tly sh@@ ru@@ g our sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders ."

It &apos;s as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with mor@@ al super@@ i@@ ori@@ ty .
"And for that reason , it &apos;s very , very hard to re@@ co@@ ver from ."
Here &apos;s what it looks like .
It &apos;s mar@@ ked by one li@@ p cor@@ ner pul@@ led up and in .
It &apos;s the only as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ cal ex@@ pres@@ sion .
They will take bar@@ r@@ ier obje@@ cts and put them between themselves and the person that is inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ing them .
Now here &apos;s the deal .
These behavi@@ ors are just behavi@@ ors .
They &apos;re not pro@@ of of de@@ cep@@ tion .
They &apos;re red fl@@ ag@@ s .
We &apos;re human be@@ ings .
We make de@@ cep@@ tive f@@ la@@ il@@ ing g@@ est@@ ures all over the place all day long .
"And as I pro@@ mis@@ ed , we &apos;re now going to look at what the tru@@ th looks like ."
And these were sur@@ fac@@ ed by resear@@ ch@@ er Davi@@ d M@@ at@@ su@@ mo@@ to in C@@ alifor@@ nia .
"This mother , D@@ i@@ ane D@@ ow@@ ns , sh@@ ot her kids at close r@@ ange , dro@@ ve them to the ho@@ spit@@ al while they b@@ led all over the car , c@@ la@@ im@@ ed a sc@@ ra@@ gg@@ y@@ -@@ ha@@ i@@ red str@@ ang@@ er did it ."
"And you &apos;ll see when you see the video , she can &apos;t even pre@@ ten@@ d to be an ag@@ oni@@ z@@ ing mother ."
"And if you look clo@@ se@@ ly , you &apos;ll see du@@ ping de@@ light throu@@ gh@@ out this video ."
That bo@@ thers me the most .
"And she f@@ ou@@ ght , and I know she f@@ ou@@ ght you ."
"But I know she looked at you with those amazing b@@ row@@ n eyes , and you still wanted to ki@@ ll her ."
"And I don &apos;t understand it , and I never will ."
"Now the technology around what the tru@@ th looks like is pro@@ gre@@ s@@ sing on , the science of it ."
"And these technolog@@ ies are going to be marke@@ ted to all of us as pan@@ ace@@ as for de@@ ce@@ it , and they will pro@@ ve incredi@@ bly us@@ e@@ ful some day ."
"They know , as someone once said , &quot; Ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter &apos;s who you are in the dar@@ k . &quot;"

O@@ ur world is li@@ t up 2@@ 4 hours a day .
"So one challen@@ ge we have is to remember , over@@ sh@@ aring , that &apos;s not hon@@ est@@ y ."
And that &apos;s the tru@@ th . Thank you .
( Applause )
"N@@ ot in@@ fini@@ te con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation of we@@ alth , but the high@@ er the ga@@ p between r and g , the high@@ er the level of in@@ equ@@ ality of we@@ alth towar@@ ds which society ten@@ ds to con@@ ver@@ ge ."
Al@@ so there is a lot of data that still needs to be colle@@ cted .
"So let me show you a couple of fac@@ ts coming from this d@@ at@@ ab@@ ase , and then we &apos;ll re@@ turn to r bi@@ g@@ ger than g ."
So let me be very clear : The ma@@ in ex@@ plan@@ ation for this is not r bi@@ g@@ ger than g .
So let me just show you a very simple indi@@ cat@@ or about the in@@ come in@@ equ@@ ality part .
So let me show you two gra@@ ph@@ s il@@ lu@@ str@@ ating fact number two and fact number three .
"So first , if you look at the level of we@@ alth in@@ equ@@ ality , this is the share of tot@@ al we@@ alth going to the top 10 percent of we@@ alth hol@@ ders , so you can see the same kind of re@@ vers@@ al between the U.@@ S. and Europ@@ e that we had before for in@@ come in@@ equ@@ ality ."
"So we@@ alth con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation was high@@ er in Europ@@ e than in the U.@@ S. a century ago , and now it is the op@@ posi@@ te ."
"But you can also show two things : F@@ ir@@ st , the gener@@ al level of we@@ alth in@@ equ@@ ality is always high@@ er than in@@ come in@@ equ@@ ality ."
"O@@ kay , so that &apos;s fact number one , and that &apos;s very important for what fol@@ low@@ s ."
"So the big difference today , we@@ alth in@@ equ@@ ality is still very large , with 60 , 70 percent of tot@@ al we@@ alth for the top 10 , but the good news is that it &apos;s actually better than one century ago , where you had 90 percent in Europ@@ e going to the top 10 ."
"So this is an important change , and it &apos;s interesting to see that we@@ alth in@@ equ@@ ality has not fully re@@ co@@ vered to pre@@ -@@ World W@@ ar I le@@ v@@ els , al@@ though the tot@@ al qu@@ anti@@ ty of we@@ alth has re@@ co@@ vered ."
"So what we really want to fo@@ cus on is the lon@@ g@@ -@@ run ev@@ olution of we@@ alth in@@ equ@@ ality , and what &apos;s going to happen in the future ."
"So ty@@ pi@@ cally , they want to trans@@ m@@ it we@@ alth to the next gener@@ ation , to their children , or sometimes they want to ac@@ cu@@ mul@@ ate we@@ alth because of the pre@@ sti@@ ge , the power that goes with we@@ alth ."
"So for in@@ stance , some fam@@ il@@ ies have a very large number of children , so the we@@ alth will be di@@ vi@@ ded ."
S@@ ome fam@@ il@@ ies have fe@@ wer children .
You also have sh@@ oc@@ ks to r@@ ates of re@@ turn .
S@@ ome fam@@ il@@ ies make huge ca@@ pi@@ tal ga@@ ins .
So you will always have some mo@@ bility in the we@@ alth process .
"S@@ ome people will move up , some people will move down ."
"And this was in a way very obvi@@ ous to everybody for a simple reason , which is that grow@@ th was close to zer@@ o percent during most of the history of man@@ kind ."
"It was , for land as@@ se@@ ts , which was the tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal form of as@@ se@@ ts in pre@@ indu@@ stri@@ al socie@@ ties , it was ty@@ pi@@ cally five percent ."
"If you want an an@@ nu@@ al in@@ come of 1@@ ,000 po@@ un@@ ds , you should have a ca@@ pi@@ tal val@@ ue of 20@@ ,000 po@@ un@@ ds so that five percent of 20@@ ,000 is 1@@ ,000 ."
"And in a way , this was the very f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of society , because r bi@@ g@@ ger than g was what allow@@ ed hol@@ ders of we@@ alth and as@@ se@@ ts to live off their ca@@ pi@@ tal in@@ come and to do something else in life than just to care about their own survi@@ v@@ al ."
"Now , one important con@@ clu@@ sion of my histori@@ cal research is that moder@@ n indu@@ stri@@ al grow@@ th did not change this basi@@ c fact as much as one might have expe@@ cted ."
"So during the 20@@ th century , you had a very uni@@ qu@@ e com@@ bin@@ ation of ev@@ ents ."
"H@@ ere I use the United N@@ ations popul@@ ation proje@@ ctions , so of course they are un@@ certain ."
"It could be that we all start having a lot of children in the future , and the grow@@ th r@@ ates are going to be high@@ er , but from now on , these are the best proje@@ ctions we have , and this will make global grow@@ th dec@@ line and the ga@@ p between the r@@ ate of re@@ turn go up ."
"In the cur@@ r@@ ent poli@@ tical con@@ te@@ xt , how reali@@ stic are those ?"
How li@@ ke@@ ly do you think that it is that they will be im@@ ple@@ men@@ ted ?
So I am not terri@@ bly im@@ pres@@ sed by those who know in adv@@ ance what will or will not happen .
So I think these are not techni@@ cal difficul@@ ties .
"So we take meas@@ ures to low@@ er in@@ equ@@ ality , and at the same time we low@@ er grow@@ th , poten@@ ti@@ ally ."
What do you answer to that ?
"T@@ P : Yeah , I think in@@ equ@@ ality is not a problem per se ."
I think in@@ equ@@ ality up to a point can actually be us@@ e@@ ful for in@@ no@@ vation and grow@@ th .
"The problem is , it &apos;s a question of de@@ gre@@ e ."
It is actually us@@ e@@ ful both for e@@ qui@@ ty and ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy reas@@ ons .
B@@ G : I said at the beginning that your book has been cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed .
S@@ ome of your data has been cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed .
"T@@ P : Well , I answer that I am very happy that this book is sti@@ mu@@ lat@@ ing de@@ b@@ ate ."
This is part of what it is inten@@ ded for .
"L@@ ook , the reason why I put all the data on@@ line with all of the de@@ ta@@ i@@ led compu@@ tation is so that we can have an open and tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent de@@ b@@ ate about this ."
"There is a re@@ cent study by S@@ a@@ e@@ z and Z@@ u@@ c@@ man show@@ ing , with new data which I didn &apos;t have at the time of the book , that we@@ alth con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation in the U.@@ S. has ri@@ s@@ en even more than what I re@@ port ."
And there will be other data in the future .
S@@ ome of it will go in different dire@@ ctions .
"So ta@@ x@@ ation is a source of know@@ le@@ dge , and that &apos;s what we need the most right now ."
"B@@ G : Th@@ om@@ as P@@ i@@ ke@@ t@@ ty , mer@@ ci beau@@ cou@@ p ."

I wan@@ na start today — here &apos;s my thing . H@@ old on . There I go .

"And I was thinking about this , what to talk about at TED ."
"When I tal@@ ked to the kind re@@ p from TED , and I said , &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , you know , what should I talk about ? &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about it . J@@ ust be pro@@ found . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I took en@@ or@@ m@@ ous comfor@@ t in that ."
"So th@@ ank you , if you &apos;re here ."
"I was trying to think , what do I talk about ? It &apos;s a good question ."
Why do I do so much stuff that inv@@ ol@@ ves m@@ yst@@ ery ? And I started trying to figure it out .
"And I started thinking about why do I do any of what I do , and I started thinking about my grand@@ father ."
"I lo@@ ved my grand@@ father . H@@ ar@@ ry K@@ el@@ v@@ in was his name , my mother &apos;s father . He d@@ ied in 19@@ 8@@ 6 . He was an amazing guy ."
And one of the reas@@ ons he was amazing : Af@@ ter World W@@ ar I@@ I he began an ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs company .
"He started sel@@ ling sur@@ p@@ lu@@ s par@@ ts , ki@@ ts , to scho@@ ols and stuff ."
So he had this incredible cu@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty . A@@ s a kid I saw him come over to me with radi@@ os and tele@@ ph@@ ones and all sor@@ ts of things .
"And he &apos;d open them up , he &apos;d un@@ scre@@ w them , and re@@ ve@@ al the in@@ ner wor@@ k@@ ings — which many of us , I &apos;m sure , take for gran@@ ted ."
But it &apos;s an amazing gi@@ ft to give a kid .
To open up this thing and show how it works and why it works and what it is .
"He was the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate de@@ con@@ stru@@ c@@ ter , in many ways ."
"And my grand@@ father was a kind of guy who would not only take things a@@ part , but he got me interested in all sor@@ ts of different od@@ d c@@ ra@@ f@@ ts , like , you know , prin@@ ting , like the let@@ ter pre@@ ss . I &apos;m ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with prin@@ ting ."
I &apos;m ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with sil@@ k scre@@ ening and bo@@ ok@@ bin@@ ding and box making .
"When I was a kid , I was always , like , taking a@@ part bo@@ x@@ es and stuff ."
"And last night in the hot@@ el , I took a@@ part the K@@ le@@ ene@@ x box ."
I was just looking at it . And I &apos;m tel@@ ling you ... ( Laughter ) It &apos;s a beautiful thing .
"I s@@ we@@ ar to God . I mean , when you look at the box , and you sort of see how it works ."
"R@@ i@@ ves is here , and I met him years ago at a book fa@@ ir ; he does po@@ p@@ -@@ up boo@@ ks ."
"And I &apos;m ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with , like , engine@@ ering of pa@@ per ."
"But like , the sc@@ or@@ ing of it , the prin@@ ting of it , where the thing gets g@@ lu@@ ed , you know , the regi@@ str@@ ation mar@@ ks for the in@@ k . I just love bo@@ x@@ es ."
"My grand@@ father was sort of the guy who , you know , kind of got me into all sor@@ ts of these things ."
He would also su@@ pp@@ ly me with to@@ ols .
"He was this amazing en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ger — this pat@@ ro@@ n , sort of , to make stuff ."
And he got me a Su@@ per 8 cam@@ era when I was 10 years old .
"And in 19@@ 7@@ 6 , that was sort of an an@@ om@@ al@@ y , to be a 1@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old kid that had ac@@ cess to a cam@@ era ."
"And you know , he was so gener@@ ous ; I couldn &apos;t believe it ."
He wasn &apos;t doing it enti@@ re@@ ly without some m@@ ani@@ pul@@ ation .
"I mean , I would call him , and I &apos;d be like , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , G@@ ran@@ d@@ p@@ a , I really need this cam@@ era ."
"You don &apos;t understand . This is , like , you know , I want to make mov@@ ies ."
"I &apos;ll get in@@ vi@@ ted to TED one day . This is like — &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And you know , and my grand@@ mother was the gre@@ at@@ est ."
"Because she &apos;d be like , you know — she &apos;d get on the phone ."
"S@@ he &apos;d be like , &quot; &quot; H@@ ar@@ ry , it &apos;s better than the dru@@ gs . He should be doing — &quot; &quot; She was fanta@@ stic . ( Laughter ) So I found myself getting this stuff , th@@ an@@ ks to her as@@ si@@ st , and sud@@ den@@ ly , you know , I had a syn@@ the@@ si@@ z@@ er when I was 14 years old — this kind of stuff ."
"And it let me make things , which , to me , was sort of the dre@@ am ."
"He sort of hu@@ mo@@ red my ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion to other things too , like mag@@ ic ."
"The thing is , we &apos;d go to this mag@@ ic stor@@ e in New York C@@ ity called L@@ ou T@@ an@@ ne@@ n &apos;s M@@ ag@@ ic ."
"It was this great mag@@ ic stor@@ e . It was a c@@ ra@@ pp@@ y little building in Mi@@ d@@ tow@@ n , but you &apos;d be in the ele@@ v@@ ator , the ele@@ v@@ ator would open — there &apos;d be this little , small mag@@ ic stor@@ e . You &apos;d be in the mag@@ ic stor@@ e ."
"And it was just , it was a mag@@ i@@ cal place ."
"So I got all these sort of mag@@ ic tri@@ cks . Oh , here . I &apos;ll show you ."
"This is the kind of thing . So it would be like , you know . R@@ ight ?"
"Wh@@ ich is good , but now I can &apos;t move ."
"Now , I have to do this , the rest of the thing , like this ."
"I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh , wo@@ w . L@@ ook at my computer over there ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) An@@ y@@ way , so one of the things that I b@@ ou@@ ght at the mag@@ ic stor@@ e was this : T@@ an@@ ne@@ n &apos;s M@@ yst@@ ery M@@ ag@@ ic Bo@@ x ."
The pre@@ mi@@ se behind the m@@ yst@@ ery mag@@ ic box was the fol@@ low@@ ing : 15 dollars bu@@ ys you 50 dollars wor@@ th of mag@@ ic .
"Wh@@ ich is a sa@@ v@@ ings . ( Laughter ) Now , I b@@ ou@@ ght this de@@ ca@@ des ago and I &apos;m not ki@@ d@@ ding ."
"If you look at this , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s never been open@@ ed ."
But I &apos;ve had this fore@@ ver .
"Now , I was looking at this , it was in my offi@@ ce , as it always is , on the sh@@ el@@ f , and I was thinking , why have I not open@@ ed this ?"
And why have I ke@@ pt it ? Because I &apos;m not a p@@ ack r@@ at . I don &apos;t keep everything but for some reason I ha@@ ven &apos;t open@@ ed this box .
"And I felt like there was a key to this , some@@ how , in talking about something at TED that I ha@@ ven &apos;t di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed before , and bo@@ red people el@@ se@@ where ."
"So I thought , maybe there &apos;s something with this . I started thinking about it ."
"And there was this gi@@ ant question mar@@ k . I love the design , for what it &apos;s wor@@ th , of this thing . And I started thinking , why ha@@ ven &apos;t I open@@ ed it ?"
And I realized that I ha@@ ven &apos;t open@@ ed it because it re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts something important — to me . It re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts my grand@@ father .
"A@@ m I allow@@ ed to c@@ ry at TED ? Because — no , I &apos;m not going to c@@ ry . But — ( Laughter ) — the thing is , that it re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts in@@ fini@@ te possi@@ bility ."
It re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts hope . It re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts poten@@ tial .
"And what I love about this box , and what I realize I sort of do in whatever it is that I do , is I find myself d@@ raw@@ n to in@@ fini@@ te possi@@ bility , that sense of poten@@ tial ."
And I realize that m@@ yst@@ ery is the cat@@ al@@ y@@ st for imag@@ in@@ ation .
"Now , it &apos;s not the most gro@@ un@@ d-@@ bre@@ aking idea , but when I started to think that maybe there are times when m@@ yst@@ ery is more important than know@@ le@@ dge , I started getting interested in this ."
"And so I started thinking about &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ st , &quot; &quot; and the stuff that we do , and I realized , oh my God , m@@ yst@@ ery bo@@ x@@ es are every@@ where in what I do !"
"In how — in the cre@@ ation of &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ st , &quot; &quot; D@@ am@@ on L@@ in@@ de@@ l@@ of and I , who created the show with me , we were basically t@@ asked with cre@@ ating this ser@@ ies that we had very little time to do . We had 11 and a half weeks to write it , c@@ ast it , cre@@ w it , sho@@ ot it , cut it , pos@@ t it , turn in a two@@ -@@ hour pi@@ lot ."
So it was not a lot of time . And that sense of possi@@ bility — what could this thing be ?
There was no time to develo@@ p it .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re all fami@@ li@@ ar with those people who tell you what you can &apos;t do and what you should change .
"And there was no time for that , which is kind of amazing ."
"And so we did this show , and for those of you who , you know , who ha@@ ven &apos;t seen it , or don &apos;t know it , I can show you this one little cli@@ p from the pi@@ lot , just to show you some stuff that we did ."
C@@ la@@ i@@ re : H@@ el@@ p ! P@@ le@@ ase help me ! H@@ el@@ p me ! H@@ el@@ p me !
J@@ ack : G@@ et him out of here ! G@@ et him away from the eng@@ ine ! G@@ et him out of here !
C : I &apos;m having con@@ trac@@ tions !
J : How many months pre@@ gn@@ ant are you ?
C : I &apos;m only eight months .
J : And how far a@@ part are they coming ?
C : I don &apos;t know . I think it just happened .
"M@@ an : H@@ ey ! H@@ ey ! H@@ ey , get away from — J@@ J@@ A : Now , 10 years ago , if we wanted to do that , we &apos;d have to ki@@ ll a st@@ un@@ t@@ man ."
We &apos;d actually — ( Laughter ) it would be har@@ der . It would take — T@@ ake 2 would be a bi@@ t@@ ch .
"So the amazing thing was , we were able to do this thing ."
"And part of that was the amazing avail@@ ability of technology , know@@ ing we could do anything . I mean , we could never have done that ."
"We might have been able to write it ; we wouldn &apos;t have been able to de@@ pi@@ ct it like we did . And so part of the amazing thing for me is in the cre@@ ative process , technology is , like , min@@ d-@@ b@@ low@@ ing@@ ly in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing to me ."
"I realize that that bl@@ ank p@@ age is a mag@@ ic box , you know ?"
It needs to be fil@@ led with something fanta@@ stic .
I used to have the &quot; &quot; O@@ r@@ din@@ ary Pe@@ ople &quot; &quot; sc@@ ri@@ pt that I &apos;d fli@@ p through .
The ro@@ m@@ ance of the sc@@ ri@@ pt was amazing to me ; it would inspi@@ re me .
I wanted to try and fi@@ ll p@@ ages with the same kind of sp@@ ir@@ it and thought and emoti@@ on that that sc@@ ri@@ pt did .
"You know , I love A@@ pp@@ le compu@@ ters . I &apos;m ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed ."
"So the A@@ pp@@ le computer — like those — the Pow@@ er@@ B@@ ook — this computer , right , it challen@@ ges me . It basically says , what are you going to write wor@@ th@@ y of me ? ( Laughter ) I gu@@ ess I feel this — I &apos;m compe@@ l@@ led ."
"And I often am like , you know , du@@ de , today I &apos;m out . I got nothing . You know ? ( Laughter ) So there &apos;s that . In terms of the cont@@ ent of it , you look at stories , you think , well , what are stories but m@@ yst@@ ery bo@@ x@@ es ?"
"There &apos;s a fundam@@ ent@@ al question — in T@@ V , the first act is called the te@@ as@@ er ."
It &apos;s liter@@ ally the te@@ as@@ er . It &apos;s the big question .
"So you &apos;re d@@ raw@@ n into it . Th@@ en of course , there &apos;s another question . And it goes on and on ."
L@@ ook at &quot; &quot; St@@ ar W@@ ars . &quot; &quot; You got the dro@@ i@@ ds ; they me@@ et the m@@ yst@@ eri@@ ous woman .
Wh@@ o &apos;s that ? We don &apos;t know . M@@ yst@@ ery box ! You know ?
"Th@@ en you me@@ et Lu@@ ke S@@ k@@ y@@ wal@@ k@@ er . He gets the D@@ ro@@ id , you see the ho@@ lo@@ gra@@ phi@@ c image ."
"You learn , oh , it &apos;s a mess@@ age , you know ."
"S@@ he wan@@ ts to , you know , find O@@ b@@ i W@@ an Ken@@ ob@@ i . He &apos;s her only hope ."
But who the he@@ ll &apos;s O@@ b@@ i W@@ an Ken@@ ob@@ i ? M@@ yst@@ ery box !
So then you go and he me@@ ets B@@ en Ken@@ ob@@ i . B@@ en Ken@@ ob@@ i is O@@ b@@ i W@@ an Ken@@ ob@@ i .
H@@ o@@ ly sh@@ it ! You know — so it ke@@ e@@ ps us — ( Laughter ) — have you guys not seen that ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s huge ! An@@ y@@ way — So there &apos;s this thing with m@@ yst@@ ery bo@@ x@@ es that I started feeling compe@@ l@@ led .
"Th@@ en there &apos;s the thing of m@@ yst@@ ery in terms of imag@@ in@@ ation — the with@@ hol@@ ding of information . You know , doing that inten@@ tion@@ ally is much more eng@@ ag@@ ing ."
"W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s like the sh@@ ar@@ k in &quot; &quot; J@@ aw@@ s &quot; &quot; — if S@@ pie@@ l@@ ber@@ g &apos;s mechani@@ cal sh@@ ar@@ k , B@@ ru@@ ce , had worked , it would not be re@@ mot@@ ely as sc@@ ary ; you would have seen it too much ."
"In &quot; &quot; A@@ lie@@ n &quot; &quot; , they never really show@@ ed the al@@ ie@@ n : terri@@ f@@ ying !"
"E@@ ven in a movie , like a ro@@ man@@ tic com@@ e@@ dy , &quot; &quot; The G@@ ra@@ du@@ ate , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re having that d@@ ate , remember ?"
"And they &apos;re in the car , and it &apos;s l@@ ou@@ d , and so they put the top up ."
They &apos;re in there — you don &apos;t hear anything they &apos;re saying ! You can &apos;t hear a word !
But it &apos;s the most ro@@ man@@ tic d@@ ate ever . And you love it because you don &apos;t hear it .
"So to me , there &apos;s that ."
"And then , finally , there &apos;s this idea — stre@@ t@@ ching the sort of par@@ ad@@ ig@@ m a little bit — but the idea of the m@@ yst@@ ery box ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ ing , what you think you &apos;re getting , then what you &apos;re really getting ."
And it &apos;s true in so many mov@@ ies and stories .
"And when you look at &quot; &quot; E@@ .@@ T@@ . , &quot; &quot; for example — &quot; &quot; E@@ .@@ T@@ . &quot; &quot; is this , you know , un@@ belie@@ v@@ able movie about what ? It &apos;s about an al@@ ie@@ n who me@@ ets a kid , right ?"
"Well , it &apos;s not . &quot; &quot; E@@ .@@ T@@ . &quot; &quot; is about di@@ v@@ or@@ ce . &quot; &quot; E@@ .@@ T@@ . &quot; &quot; is about a hear@@ t@@ bro@@ k@@ en , di@@ v@@ or@@ ce@@ -@@ cri@@ pp@@ led family , and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , this kid who can &apos;t find his way ."
"&quot; &quot; D@@ ie H@@ ard , &quot; &quot; right ? C@@ razy , great , fun , ac@@ tion@@ -@@ ad@@ ven@@ ture movie in a building ."
It &apos;s about a guy who &apos;s on the ver@@ ge of di@@ v@@ or@@ ce .
"He &apos;s show@@ ing up to L@@ .@@ A@@ . , ta@@ il between his le@@ gs ."
"There are great scen@@ es — maybe not the most amazing dra@@ m@@ atic scen@@ es in the history of time , but pretty great scen@@ es ."
"There &apos;s a half an hour of inv@@ est@@ ment in char@@ ac@@ ter before you get to the stuff that you &apos;re , you know , expe@@ cting ."
"When you look at a movie like &quot; &quot; J@@ aw@@ s , &quot; &quot; the scen@@ e that you expe@@ ct — we have the scre@@ en ?"
"These are the kind of , you know , scen@@ es that you remember and expe@@ ct from &quot; &quot; J@@ aw@@ s . &quot; &quot; And she &apos;s being e@@ at@@ en ; there &apos;s a sh@@ ar@@ k ."
"The thing about &quot; &quot; J@@ aw@@ s &quot; &quot; is , it &apos;s really about a guy who is sort of de@@ al@@ ing with his place in the world — with his mas@@ cu@@ lin@@ ity , with his family , how he &apos;s going to , you know , make it work in this new tow@@ n ."
"This is one of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te scen@@ es ever , and this is a scen@@ e that you wouldn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly think of when you think of &quot; &quot; J@@ aw@@ s . &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s an amazing scen@@ e ."
F@@ a@@ ther : C &apos;@@ m@@ ere . G@@ i@@ ve us a k@@ is@@ s .
S@@ on : Why ?
F@@ a@@ ther : &apos; C@@ a@@ use I need it .
"J@@ J@@ A : C &apos;@@ m@@ on . &quot; &quot; Why ? &apos; C@@ a@@ use I need it ? &quot; &quot; B@@ est scen@@ e ever , right ?"
"C@@ ome on ! So you think of &quot; &quot; J@@ aw@@ s &quot; &quot; — so that &apos;s the kind of stuff that , like , you know , the inv@@ est@@ ment of char@@ ac@@ ter , which is the stuff that really is inside the box , you know ?"
"It &apos;s why when people do sequ@@ els , or ri@@ p off mov@@ ies , you know , of a gen@@ re , they &apos;re ri@@ pping off the wrong thing ."
You &apos;re not sup@@ posed to ri@@ p off the sh@@ ar@@ k or the mon@@ ster .
"You got@@ ta ri@@ p off — you know , if you ri@@ p something off — ri@@ p off the char@@ ac@@ ter ."
"R@@ i@@ p off the stuff that mat@@ ters . I mean , look inside yourself and figure out what is inside you ."
"Because ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , you know , the m@@ yst@@ ery box is all of us . So there &apos;s that ."
Th@@ en the di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion . What &apos;s a bi@@ g@@ ger m@@ yst@@ ery box than a movie the@@ ater ?
"You know ? You go to the the@@ ater , you &apos;re just so exci@@ ted to see anything ."
"The moment the li@@ ghts go down is often the best part , you know ?"
And you &apos;re full of that amazing — that feeling of exci@@ ted anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation .
"And often , the movie &apos;s , like , there and it &apos;s going , and then something happens and you go , &quot; &quot; Oh — &quot; &quot; and then something else , and you &apos;re , &quot; &quot; M@@ m@@ m ... &quot; &quot; Now , when it &apos;s a great movie , you &apos;re along for the ri@@ de &apos; cause you &apos;re wil@@ ling to give yourself to it ."
"So to me , whether it &apos;s that , whether it &apos;s a T@@ V , an i@@ P@@ od , computer , cell phone — it &apos;s fun@@ ny , I &apos;m an — as I said , A@@ pp@@ le fan@@ atic — and one day , about a year or so ago , I was sig@@ ning on on@@ line in the morning to wat@@ ch Ste@@ ve J@@ ob@@ s &apos; ke@@ y@@ not@@ e , &apos; cause I always do . And he came on , he was pres@@ ent@@ ing the video i@@ P@@ od , and what was on the en@@ or@@ m@@ ous i@@ P@@ od behind him ?"
"&quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ st &quot; &quot; ! I had no idea ! And I realized , ho@@ ly sh@@ it , it &apos;d come full cir@@ cle ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation I get from the technology is now using the stuff that I do , inspi@@ red by it , to se@@ ll technology . I mean , it &apos;s nu@@ ts ! ( Laughter ) I was g@@ on@@ na show you a couple of other things I &apos;m g@@ on@@ na sk@@ i@@ p through ."
I just want to show you one other thing that has nothing to do with anything .
This is something on@@ line ; I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve seen it before .
"S@@ i@@ x years ago they did this . This is an on@@ line thing done by guys who had some vi@@ su@@ al effe@@ cts experience . But the point was , that they were doing things that were using these m@@ yst@@ ery bo@@ x@@ es that they had — everyone has now ."
"What I &apos;ve realized is what my grand@@ father did for me when I was a kid , everyone has ac@@ cess to now ."
"You don &apos;t need to have my grand@@ father , though you wi@@ shed you had ."
But I have to tell you — this is a guy doing stuff on a Q@@ u@@ ad@@ ra 9@@ 50 computer — the re@@ solution &apos;s a little bit low — using In@@ fini@@ ty so@@ f@@ tw@@ are they stop@@ ped making 15 years ago .
He &apos;s doing stuff that looks as amazing as stuff I &apos;ve seen rele@@ as@@ ed from H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood .
"The most incredible sort of m@@ yst@@ ery , I think , is now the question of what comes next ."
"Because it is now de@@ moc@@ r@@ ati@@ zed . So now , the cre@@ ation of media is — it &apos;s every@@ where ."
The stuff that I was lu@@ ck@@ y and be@@ gg@@ ing for to get when I was a kid is now u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
"And so , there &apos;s an amazing sense of opportunity out there ."
"And when I think of the fil@@ m@@ mak@@ ers who exi@@ st out there now who would have been si@@ len@@ ced , you know — who have been si@@ len@@ ced in the past — it &apos;s a very exci@@ ting thing ."
"I used to say in clas@@ ses and le@@ ctures and stuff , to someone who wan@@ ts to write , &quot; &quot; G@@ o ! W@@ ri@@ te ! Do your thing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s f@@ ree , you know , you don &apos;t need per@@ mis@@ sion to go write . But now I can say , &quot; &quot; G@@ o make your movie ! &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing stop@@ ping you from going out there and getting the technology ."
"You can le@@ ase , r@@ ent , bu@@ y stuff off the sh@@ el@@ f that is either as good , or just as good , as the stuff that &apos;s being used by the , you know , quot@@ e un@@ quot@@ e &quot; &quot; leg@@ it people . &quot; &quot; No community is best ser@@ ved when only the e@@ li@@ te have control ."
And I feel like this is an amazing opportunity to see what else is out there .
"When I did &quot; &quot; M@@ is@@ sion : I@@ m@@ possible I@@ I@@ I , &quot; &quot; we had amazing vi@@ su@@ al effe@@ cts stuff ."
I@@ L@@ M did the effe@@ cts ; it was incredible .
And sort of like my dre@@ am to be inv@@ olved .
"And there are a couple of sequ@@ ences in the movie , like these couple of mom@@ ents I &apos;ll show you ."
There &apos;s that .
"O@@ kay , obvi@@ ously I have an ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion with big c@@ razy ex@@ plo@@ sions ."
So my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te vi@@ su@@ al effe@@ ct in the movie is the one I &apos;m about to show you .
"And it &apos;s a scen@@ e in which T@@ om &apos;s char@@ ac@@ ter wa@@ k@@ es up . He &apos;s d@@ row@@ sy . He &apos;s c@@ razy — out of it . And the guy wa@@ k@@ es up , and he sho@@ ves this gu@@ n in his no@@ se and sho@@ ots this little cap@@ su@@ le into his brain that he &apos;s going to use later to ki@@ ll him , as bad guys do ."
B@@ ad G@@ u@@ y : Go@@ od morning .
"J@@ J@@ A : OK , now . When we sh@@ ot that scen@@ e , we were there doing it , the ac@@ tor who had the gu@@ n , an En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ac@@ tor , E@@ dd@@ ie Mar@@ s@@ an — s@@ wee@@ the@@ art , great guy — he ke@@ pt taking the gu@@ n and pu@@ tting it into T@@ om &apos;s no@@ se , and it was h@@ ur@@ ting T@@ om &apos;s no@@ se ."
And I learned this very early on in my car@@ e@@ er : D@@ on &apos;t h@@ ur@@ t T@@ om &apos;s no@@ se . ( Laughter ) There are three things you don &apos;t want to do . N@@ um@@ ber two is : D@@ on &apos;t h@@ ur@@ t T@@ om &apos;s no@@ se .
"So E@@ dd@@ ie has this gu@@ n — and he &apos;s the gre@@ at@@ est guy — he &apos;s this really s@@ we@@ et En@@ g@@ li@@ sh guy . He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; S@@ or@@ ry , I don &apos;t want to h@@ ur@@ t you . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like — you got@@ ta — we have to make this look good ."
And I realized that we had to do something &apos; cause it wasn &apos;t working just as it was .
"And I liter@@ ally , like , thought back to what I would have done using the Su@@ per 8 cam@@ era that my grand@@ father got me sitting in that room , and I realized that hand didn &apos;t have to be E@@ dd@@ ie Mar@@ s@@ an &apos;s . It could be T@@ om &apos;s ."
And T@@ om would know just how hard to p@@ us@@ h the gu@@ n . He wouldn &apos;t h@@ ur@@ t hi@@ m@@ self .
So we took his hand and we pain@@ ted it to look a little bit more like E@@ dd@@ ie &apos;s .
"We put it in E@@ dd@@ ie &apos;s sle@@ e@@ ve , and so the hand that you see — I &apos;ll show you again , that &apos;s not E@@ dd@@ ie &apos;s hand , that &apos;s T@@ om &apos;s ."
So T@@ om is playing two ro@@ les . ( Laughter ) And he didn &apos;t ask for any more money .
"So here , here . W@@ at@@ ch it again ."
"There he is . He &apos;s wa@@ king up . He &apos;s d@@ row@@ sy , been through a lot ."
T@@ om &apos;s hand . T@@ om &apos;s hand . T@@ om &apos;s hand . ( Laughter ) An@@ y@@ way .
So .
( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks .
So you don &apos;t need the gre@@ at@@ est technology to do things that can work in mov@@ ies .
"And the m@@ yst@@ ery box , in hon@@ or of my grand@@ father , sta@@ ys clo@@ sed ."
So here are four different te@@ as that we &apos;ve test@@ ed .
And here are the d@@ ie@@ t@@ ary fac@@ t@@ ors going he@@ ad@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ head against these dru@@ gs .
Because it turns out that ad@@ i@@ pos@@ e ti@@ s@@ su@@ e — f@@ at — is high@@ ly an@@ gi@@ og@@ ene@@ si@@ s@@ -@@ depen@@ dent .
"D@@ o you re@@ comm@@ end pur@@ su@@ ing these tre@@ at@@ ments now , for most can@@ cer patients ?"
"The An@@ gi@@ og@@ ene@@ sis F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation is fol@@ low@@ ing almost 3@@ 00 comp@@ an@@ ies , and there are about 100 more dru@@ gs in that pi@@ pe@@ line ."
"So if you &apos;ve been fol@@ low@@ ing the news , you &apos;ve heard that there &apos;s a p@@ ack of gi@@ ant ast@@ er@@ o@@ i@@ ds he@@ ad@@ ed for the United States , all s@@ che@@ du@@ led to stri@@ ke within the next 50 years ."
Now I don &apos;t mean ac@@ tu@@ al ast@@ er@@ o@@ i@@ ds made of ro@@ ck and me@@ tal .
"That actually wouldn &apos;t be such a problem , because if we were really all going to die , we would put a@@ side our differ@@ ences , we &apos;d spend whatever it took , and we &apos;d find a way to def@@ le@@ ct them ."
"I &apos;m talking instead about thre@@ ats that are he@@ ad@@ ed our way , but they &apos;re w@@ ra@@ pped in a spe@@ cial energy fie@@ ld that po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ es us , and ther@@ e@@ fore par@@ al@@ yz@@ es us ."
"L@@ ast Mar@@ ch , I went to the TED con@@ fer@@ ence , and I saw J@@ im H@@ ans@@ en speak , the N@@ A@@ SA scienti@@ st who first ra@@ is@@ ed the al@@ ar@@ m about global war@@ ming in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s , and it seem@@ s that the pre@@ di@@ ctions he made back then are coming true ."
"This is where we &apos;re he@@ ad@@ ed in terms of global temper@@ ature ri@@ ses , and if we keep on going the way we &apos;re going , we get a f@@ our@@ - or fi@@ ve@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e-@@ C@@ enti@@ gra@@ de temper@@ ature ri@@ se by the end of this century ."
H@@ ans@@ en says we can expe@@ ct about a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ me@@ ter ri@@ se in se@@ a le@@ v@@ els .
This is what a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ me@@ ter ri@@ se in se@@ a le@@ v@@ els would look like .
L@@ ow@@ -@@ l@@ ying cities all around the world will disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar within the li@@ fe@@ time of children born today .
"H@@ ans@@ en clo@@ sed his talk by saying , &quot; &quot; I@@ mag@@ ine a gi@@ ant ast@@ er@@ o@@ id on a col@@ li@@ sion course with Earth ."
That is the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of what we face now .
"@@ Y@@ et we di@@ ther , taking no action to def@@ le@@ ct the ast@@ er@@ o@@ id , even though the longer we wa@@ it , the more difficult and ex@@ pen@@ sive it be@@ comes . &quot; &quot; O@@ f course , the left wan@@ ts to take action , but the right den@@ ies that there &apos;s any problem ."
"A@@ ll right , so I go back from TED , and then the fol@@ low@@ ing week , I &apos;m in@@ vi@@ ted to a din@@ ner par@@ ty in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , where I know that I &apos;ll be me@@ e@@ ting a number of con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ als , inclu@@ ding Y@@ u@@ v@@ al L@@ ev@@ in , and to pre@@ p@@ are for the me@@ e@@ ting , I read this arti@@ cle by L@@ ev@@ in in N@@ ational Af@@ fa@@ ir@@ s called &quot; &quot; Be@@ y@@ ond the W@@ el@@ f@@ are St@@ ate . &quot; &quot; L@@ ev@@ in wri@@ tes that all over the world , n@@ ations are coming to terms with the fact that the social de@@ moc@@ r@@ atic wel@@ f@@ are state is tur@@ ning out to be un@@ ten@@ able and u@@ na@@ f@@ for@@ d@@ able , depen@@ dent upo@@ n du@@ bi@@ ous econ@@ omi@@ cs and the demo@@ gra@@ phi@@ c model of a by@@ gone era ."
"A@@ ll right , now this might not sound as sc@@ ary as an ast@@ er@@ o@@ id , but look at these gra@@ ph@@ s that L@@ ev@@ in show@@ ed ."
"This gra@@ ph shows the national de@@ b@@ t as a per@@ cent@@ age of America &apos;s G@@ D@@ P , and as you see , if you go all the way back to the f@@ oun@@ ding , we bor@@ row@@ ed a lot of money to fi@@ ght the R@@ ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary W@@ ar ."
"W@@ ars are ex@@ pen@@ sive . But then we &apos;d pay it off , pay it off , pay it off , and then , oh , what &apos;s this ? The C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar . E@@ ven more ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
"B@@ or@@ row a lot of money , pay it off , pay it off , pay it off , get down to ne@@ ar zer@@ o , and ban@@ g ! — World W@@ ar I@@ ."
"O@@ n@@ ce again , the same process re@@ pe@@ ats ."
Now then we get the Gre@@ at De@@ pres@@ sion and World W@@ ar I@@ I .
"We ri@@ se to an ast@@ ron@@ omi@@ cal level , around 1@@ 18 percent of G@@ D@@ P , really un@@ susta@@ in@@ able , really d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ."
"But we pay it off , pay it off , pay it off , and then , what &apos;s this ?"
Why has it been ri@@ sing since the &apos; 7@@ 0s ?
"It &apos;s par@@ tly du@@ e to ta@@ x cu@@ ts that were un@@ fun@@ ded , but it &apos;s du@@ e pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly to the ri@@ se of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment sp@@ ending , es@@ pe@@ cially Me@@ di@@ care ."
"We &apos;re appro@@ ach@@ ing the le@@ v@@ els of in@@ de@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ness we had at World W@@ ar I@@ I , and the b@@ aby bo@@ om@@ ers ha@@ ven &apos;t even re@@ ti@@ red yet , and when they do , this is what will happen ."
This is data from the Con@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ onal Bu@@ d@@ get O@@ f@@ fi@@ ce show@@ ing its most reali@@ stic fore@@ c@@ ast of what would happen if cur@@ r@@ ent situ@@ ations and expe@@ ct@@ ations and tr@@ en@@ ds are ex@@ ten@@ ded .
"A@@ ll right , now what you might noti@@ ce is that these two gra@@ ph@@ s are actually iden@@ tical , not in terms of the x@@ - and y@@ -@@ ax@@ es , or in terms of the data they present , but in terms of their mor@@ al and poli@@ tical im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations , they say the same thing ."
Let me trans@@ l@@ ate for you .
&quot; &quot; We are do@@ om@@ ed un@@ less we start ac@@ ting now .
What &apos;s wrong with you people on the other side in the other par@@ ty ?
"C@@ an &apos;t you see re@@ ality ? If you won &apos;t help , then get the he@@ ll out of the way . &quot; &quot; We can def@@ le@@ ct both of these ast@@ er@@ o@@ i@@ ds ."
These problems are both techni@@ cally sol@@ v@@ able .
"O@@ ur problem and our tra@@ ge@@ dy is that in these hy@@ per@@ -@@ parti@@ s@@ an times , the m@@ ere fact that one side says , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , there &apos;s an ast@@ er@@ o@@ id , &quot; &quot; means that the other side &apos;s going to say , &quot; &quot; H@@ u@@ h ? What ?"
"No , I &apos;m not even going to look up . No . &quot; &quot; To understand why this is happening to us , and what we can do about it , we need to learn more about mor@@ al psycho@@ logy ."
"So I &apos;m a social psycho@@ logi@@ st , and I study mor@@ ality , and one of the most important prin@@ ci@@ ples of mor@@ ality is that mor@@ ality bin@@ ds and b@@ lin@@ ds ."
It bin@@ ds us into te@@ am@@ s that cir@@ cle around s@@ ac@@ red val@@ u@@ es but ther@@ e@@ by makes us go bl@@ ind to obje@@ ctive re@@ ality .
Th@@ in@@ k of it like this .
L@@ ar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale co@@ oper@@ ation is extre@@ me@@ ly r@@ are on this planet .
There are only a few species that can do it .
"That &apos;s a be@@ e@@ hi@@ ve . That &apos;s a ter@@ mi@@ te m@@ ound , a gi@@ ant ter@@ mi@@ te m@@ ound ."
"And when you find this in other animals , it &apos;s always the same story ."
"They &apos;re always all si@@ b@@ lin@@ gs who are children of a single qu@@ e@@ en , so they &apos;re all in the same boat ."
"They ri@@ se or f@@ all , they live or die , as one ."
"There &apos;s only one species on the planet that can do this without kin@@ ship , and that , of course , is us ."
"This is a re@@ con@@ stru@@ ction of an@@ cient B@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on , and this is T@@ en@@ o@@ ch@@ ti@@ t@@ l@@ an ."
"Now how did we do this ? How did we go from being hun@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ ers 1@@ 0,000 years ago to building these gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic cities in just a few thous@@ and years ?"
"It &apos;s mi@@ rac@@ ul@@ ous , and part of the ex@@ plan@@ ation is this ability to cir@@ cle around s@@ ac@@ red val@@ u@@ es ."
"As you see , tem@@ ples and god@@ s play a big ro@@ le in all an@@ cient ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations ."
This is an image of M@@ us@@ li@@ ms cir@@ c@@ ling the K@@ a@@ ab@@ a in Me@@ c@@ ca .
"It &apos;s a s@@ ac@@ red ro@@ ck , and when people cir@@ cle something together , they uni@@ te , they can tr@@ ust each other , they become one ."
It &apos;s as though you &apos;re moving an electri@@ cal wi@@ re through a mag@@ ne@@ tic fie@@ ld that gener@@ ates cur@@ r@@ ent .
"When people cir@@ cle together , they gener@@ ate a cur@@ r@@ ent ."
We love to cir@@ cle around things .
"We cir@@ cle around fl@@ ag@@ s , and then we can tr@@ ust each other ."
"We can fi@@ ght as a team , as a uni@@ t ."
"But even as mor@@ ality bin@@ ds people together into a uni@@ t , into a team , the cir@@ c@@ ling b@@ lin@@ ds them ."
It ca@@ uses them to di@@ stor@@ t re@@ ality .
We beg@@ in se@@ par@@ ating everything into good ver@@ su@@ s evi@@ l .
Now that process feel@@ s great . It feel@@ s really s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying .
But it is a g@@ ross di@@ stor@@ tion of re@@ ality .
You can see the mor@@ al ele@@ c@@ tro@@ mag@@ net oper@@ ating in the U.@@ S. Con@@ gre@@ ss .
"This is a gra@@ ph that shows the de@@ gre@@ e to which v@@ ot@@ ing in Con@@ gre@@ ss fal@@ ls stri@@ ct@@ ly along the le@@ f@@ t-@@ right ax@@ is , so that if you know how li@@ ber@@ al or con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative someone is , you know exactly how they v@@ ot@@ ed on all the major issu@@ es ."
"And what you can see is that , in the de@@ ca@@ des after the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar , Con@@ gre@@ ss was ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly po@@ lar@@ i@@ zed , as you would expe@@ ct , about as high as can be ."
"But then , after World W@@ ar I , things dro@@ pped , and we get this histori@@ cally low level of po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ ation ."
"This was a g@@ ol@@ den age of bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an@@ ship , at least in terms of the par@@ ties &apos; ability to work together and sol@@ ve gr@@ and national problems ."
"But in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s and &apos; 9@@ 0s , the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ mag@@ net turns back on ."
P@@ ol@@ ari@@ z@@ ation ri@@ ses .
It used to be that con@@ ser@@ v@@ ati@@ ves and moder@@ ates and li@@ ber@@ als could all work together in Con@@ gre@@ ss .
"They could re@@ ar@@ r@@ ange themselves , form bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an com@@ mi@@ t@@ te@@ es , but as the mor@@ al ele@@ c@@ tro@@ mag@@ net got c@@ ran@@ ked up , the force fie@@ ld incre@@ as@@ ed , De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s and Re@@ publi@@ cans were pul@@ led a@@ part ."
"It became much har@@ der for them to so@@ ci@@ ali@@ ze , much har@@ der for them to co@@ oper@@ ate ."
Re@@ ti@@ ring mem@@ bers now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys say that it &apos;s become like g@@ an@@ g war@@ f@@ are .
"D@@ id any@@ body noti@@ ce that in two of the three de@@ b@@ ates , O@@ b@@ ama wor@@ e a blue t@@ ie and R@@ om@@ ney wor@@ e a red t@@ ie ?"
Do you know why they do this ?
It &apos;s so that the B@@ lo@@ ods and the C@@ ri@@ ps will know which side to v@@ ot@@ e for . ( Laughter ) The po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ ation is stron@@ gest am@@ ong our poli@@ tical e@@ li@@ tes .
N@@ ob@@ ody d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts that this is happening in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton .
"But for a while , there was some d@@ ou@@ b@@ t as to whether it was happening am@@ ong the people ."
"Well , in the last 12 years it &apos;s become much more ap@@ par@@ ent that it is ."
So look at this data . This is from the American N@@ ational E@@ le@@ ctions S@@ ur@@ v@@ ey .
And what they do on that sur@@ v@@ ey is they ask what &apos;s called a feeling ther@@ mom@@ e@@ ter r@@ ating .
"So , how war@@ m or c@@ old do you feel about , you know , N@@ ative Ameri@@ cans , or the mi@@ lit@@ ary , the Re@@ publi@@ can Par@@ ty , the De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic Par@@ ty , all sor@@ ts of grou@@ ps in American life ."
"The blue line shows how war@@ m@@ ly De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s feel about De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s , and they like them ."
"You know , rat@@ ings in the 7@@ 0s on a 10@@ 0-@@ point scale ."
Re@@ publi@@ cans like Re@@ publi@@ cans . That &apos;s not a sur@@ pri@@ se .
"But when you look at cro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ par@@ ty rat@@ ings , you find , well , that it &apos;s low@@ er , but actually , when I first saw this data , I was sur@@ pri@@ sed ."
"That &apos;s actually not so bad . If you go back to the C@@ ar@@ ter and even Re@@ ag@@ an ad@@ min@@ ist@@ r@@ ations , they were r@@ ating the other par@@ ty 4@@ 3 , 4@@ 5 . It &apos;s not terri@@ ble ."
"It dri@@ f@@ ts dow@@ n@@ war@@ ds very sli@@ gh@@ tly , but now look what happens under G@@ e@@ or@@ ge W@@ . B@@ us@@ h and O@@ b@@ ama ."
It p@@ lu@@ m@@ me@@ ts . S@@ ome@@ thing is going on here .
"The mor@@ al ele@@ c@@ tro@@ mag@@ net is tur@@ ning back on , and now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , just very re@@ cent@@ ly , De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s really dis@@ like Re@@ publi@@ cans ."
Re@@ publi@@ cans really dis@@ like the De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s . We &apos;re chang@@ ing .
It &apos;s as though the mor@@ al ele@@ c@@ tro@@ mag@@ net is af@@ fe@@ cting us too .
"It &apos;s like put out in the two oce@@ ans and it &apos;s pul@@ ling the whole country a@@ part , pul@@ ling left and right into their own terri@@ tor@@ ies like the B@@ lo@@ ods and the C@@ ri@@ ps ."
"Now , there are many reas@@ ons why this is happening to us , and many of them we cannot re@@ verse ."
We will never again have a poli@@ tical clas@@ s that was for@@ g@@ ed by the experience of fi@@ gh@@ ting together in World W@@ ar I@@ I against a common ene@@ my .
"We will never again have just three tele@@ vision net@@ works , all of which are relati@@ vely cent@@ ri@@ st ."
"And we will never again have a large group of con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s and li@@ ber@@ al nor@@ ther@@ n Re@@ publi@@ cans making it e@@ asy , making there be a lot of over@@ la@@ p for bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an co@@ oper@@ ation ."
"So for a lot of reas@@ ons , those de@@ ca@@ des after the S@@ econ@@ d World W@@ ar were an histori@@ cally an@@ om@@ al@@ ous time ."
"We will never get back to those low le@@ v@@ els of po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ ation , I believe ."
"But there &apos;s a lot that we can do . There are do@@ z@@ ens and do@@ z@@ ens of re@@ form@@ s we can do that will make things better , because a lot of our dy@@ s@@ fun@@ ction can be trac@@ ed dire@@ ct@@ ly to things that Con@@ gre@@ ss did to itself in the 199@@ 0s that created a much more po@@ lar@@ i@@ zed and dy@@ s@@ fun@@ cti@@ onal institu@@ tion ."
These chang@@ es are de@@ ta@@ i@@ led in many boo@@ ks .
"These are two that I stron@@ g@@ ly re@@ comm@@ end , and they li@@ st a whole bu@@ n@@ ch of re@@ form@@ s ."
I &apos;m just going to group them into three bro@@ ad clas@@ ses here .
"So if you think about this as the problem of a dy@@ s@@ fun@@ cti@@ onal , hy@@ per@@ -@@ po@@ lar@@ i@@ zed institu@@ tion , well , the first ste@@ p is , do what you can so that fe@@ wer hy@@ per@@ -@@ parti@@ s@@ ans get ele@@ cted in the first place , and when you have clo@@ sed par@@ ty pri@@ mar@@ ies , and only the most com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted Re@@ publi@@ cans and De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s are v@@ ot@@ ing , you &apos;re n@@ om@@ in@@ ating and se@@ le@@ cting the most extre@@ me hy@@ per@@ -@@ parti@@ s@@ ans ."
"So open pri@@ mar@@ ies would make that problem much , much less se@@ v@@ ere ."
But the problem isn &apos;t pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly that we &apos;re ele@@ cting bad people to Con@@ gre@@ ss .
"F@@ ro@@ m my experience , and from what I &apos;ve heard from Con@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ onal in@@ si@@ ders , most of the people going to Con@@ gre@@ ss are good , har@@ d-@@ working , inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent people who really want to sol@@ ve problems , but once they get there , they find that they are for@@ ced to play a g@@ ame that re@@ war@@ ds hy@@ per@@ -@@ parti@@ s@@ an@@ ship and that pu@@ ni@@ sh@@ es in@@ depen@@ dent thinking ."
"You ste@@ p out of line , you get pu@@ ni@@ shed ."
So there are a lot of re@@ form@@ s we could do that will coun@@ ter@@ act this .
"For example , this &quot; &quot; C@@ i@@ ti@@ z@@ ens United &quot; &quot; ru@@ ling is a disa@@ ster , because it means there &apos;s like a money gu@@ n a@@ im@@ ed at your head , and if you ste@@ p out of line , if you try to re@@ ach across the a@@ is@@ le , there &apos;s a ton of money wai@@ ting to be given to your op@@ pon@@ ent to make everybody think that you are a terri@@ ble person through neg@@ ative ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing ."
But the third clas@@ s of re@@ form@@ s is that we &apos;ve got to change the nature of social relation@@ ships in Con@@ gre@@ ss .
"The poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans I &apos;ve met are gener@@ ally very ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted , frien@@ d@@ ly , very so@@ cially sk@@ il@@ l@@ ful people , and that &apos;s the nature of poli@@ ti@@ cs . You &apos;ve got to make relation@@ ships , make de@@ als , you &apos;ve got to c@@ aj@@ ole , ple@@ ase , f@@ lat@@ ter , you &apos;ve got to use your per@@ s@@ onal sk@@ il@@ ls , and that &apos;s the way poli@@ ti@@ cs has always worked ."
"But beginning in the 199@@ 0s , first the H@@ ou@@ se of Re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ati@@ ves changed its le@@ gi@@ sl@@ ative cal@@ en@@ d@@ ar so that all business is basically done in the mi@@ ddle of the week ."
"N@@ ow@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , Con@@ gre@@ s@@ s@@ men f@@ ly in on T@@ u@@ es@@ day morning , they do bat@@ tle for two days , then they f@@ ly home Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day af@@ ter@@ no@@ on ."
They don &apos;t move their fam@@ il@@ ies to the D@@ ist@@ ri@@ ct .
They don &apos;t me@@ et each other &apos;s spo@@ uses or children .
There &apos;s no more relation@@ ship there .
And trying to run Con@@ gre@@ ss without human relation@@ ships is like trying to run a car without mot@@ or oil .
S@@ h@@ ould we be sur@@ pri@@ sed when the whole thing fre@@ e@@ z@@ es up and des@@ cen@@ ds into par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s and po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ ation ?
"A simple change to the le@@ gi@@ sl@@ ative cal@@ en@@ d@@ ar , such as having business stre@@ t@@ ch out for three weeks and then they get a week off to go home , that would change the fundam@@ ent@@ al relation@@ ships in Con@@ gre@@ ss ."
"So there &apos;s a lot we can do , but who &apos;s going to p@@ us@@ h them to do it ?"
There are a number of grou@@ ps that are working on this .
"No L@@ a@@ be@@ ls and C@@ om@@ m@@ on C@@ a@@ use , I think , have very good ideas for chang@@ es we need to do to make our de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y more respon@@ sive and our Con@@ gre@@ ss more effe@@ ctive ."
"But I &apos;d like to su@@ pp@@ le@@ ment their work with a little psycho@@ logi@@ cal tri@@ ck , and the tri@@ ck is this ."
"N@@ o@@ thing pul@@ ls people together like a common thre@@ at or a common att@@ ack , es@@ pe@@ cially an att@@ ack from a fore@@ ig@@ n ene@@ my , un@@ less of course that thre@@ at hi@@ ts on our po@@ lar@@ i@@ zed psycho@@ logy , in which case , as I said before , it can actually pu@@ ll us a@@ part ."
"S@@ ome@@ times a single thre@@ at can po@@ lar@@ i@@ ze us , as we saw ."
"But what if the situ@@ ation we face is not a single thre@@ at but is actually more like this , where there &apos;s just so much stuff coming in , it &apos;s just , &quot; &quot; St@@ art sho@@ ot@@ ing , come on , everybody , we &apos;ve got to just work together , just start sho@@ ot@@ ing . &quot; &quot; Because actually , we do face this situ@@ ation ."
This is where we are as a country .
So here &apos;s another ast@@ er@@ o@@ id .
"We &apos;ve all seen ver@@ sions of this gra@@ ph , right , which shows the chang@@ es in we@@ alth since 19@@ 7@@ 9 , and as you can see , almost all the ga@@ ins in we@@ alth have gone to the top 20 percent , and es@@ pe@@ cially the top one percent ."
R@@ is@@ ing in@@ equ@@ ality like this is as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with so many problems for a de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y .
"E@@ speci@@ ally , it de@@ stro@@ ys our ability to tr@@ ust each other , to feel that we &apos;re all in the same boat , because it &apos;s obvi@@ ous we &apos;re not ."
S@@ ome of us are sitting there sa@@ fe and sound in gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic pri@@ v@@ ate y@@ ach@@ ts .
O@@ ther people are c@@ lin@@ g@@ ing to a piece of dri@@ f@@ two@@ od .
"We &apos;re not all in the same boat , and that means no@@ body &apos;s wil@@ ling to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce for the common good ."
"The left has been scre@@ am@@ ing about this ast@@ er@@ o@@ id for 30 years now , and the right says , &quot; &quot; H@@ u@@ h , what ? H@@ m@@ m ? No problem . No problem . &quot; &quot; Now , why is that happening to us ? Why is the in@@ equ@@ ality ri@@ sing ?"
"Well , one of the largest ca@@ uses , after glob@@ aliz@@ ation , is actually this f@@ our@@ th ast@@ er@@ o@@ id , ri@@ sing n@@ on-@@ mar@@ it@@ al bir@@ ths ."
This gra@@ ph shows the ste@@ ady ri@@ se of out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ we@@ d@@ lo@@ ck bir@@ ths since the 19@@ 6@@ 0s .
Mo@@ st Hi@@ sp@@ ani@@ c and black children are now born to un@@ mar@@ ried mo@@ thers .
W@@ hi@@ tes are he@@ ad@@ ed that way too .
"Wi@@ th@@ in a dec@@ ade or two , most American children will be born into hom@@ es with no father ."
This means that there &apos;s much less money coming into the house .
But it &apos;s not just money . It &apos;s also st@@ ability ver@@ su@@ s cha@@ os .
"As I know from working with stre@@ et children in B@@ raz@@ il , M@@ om &apos;s bo@@ y@@ friend is often a really , really d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous person for kids ."
"Now the right has been scre@@ am@@ ing about this ast@@ er@@ o@@ id since the 19@@ 6@@ 0s , and the left has been saying , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not a problem . It &apos;s not a problem . &quot; &quot; The left has been very re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant to say that mar@@ ri@@ age is actually good for women and for children ."
Now let me be clear . I &apos;m not bl@@ am@@ ing the women here .
I &apos;m actually more cri@@ tical of the men who won &apos;t take respon@@ si@@ bility for their own children and of an economic system that makes it difficult for many men to ear@@ n enough money to sup@@ port those children .
"But even if you bl@@ ame no@@ body , it still is a national problem , and one side has been more con@@ cer@@ ned about it than the other ."
The New York T@@ im@@ es finally noti@@ ced this ast@@ er@@ o@@ id with a fron@@ t-@@ p@@ age story last Ju@@ ly show@@ ing how the dec@@ line of mar@@ ri@@ age con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes to in@@ equ@@ ality .
We are be@@ coming a n@@ ation of just two clas@@ ses .
"When Ameri@@ cans go to colle@@ ge and mar@@ ry each other , they have very low di@@ v@@ or@@ ce r@@ ates ."
"They ear@@ n a lot of money , they inv@@ est that money in their kids , some of them become ti@@ ger mo@@ thers , the kids ri@@ se to their full poten@@ tial , and the kids go on to become the top two lin@@ es in this gra@@ ph ."
"And then there &apos;s everybody else : the children who don &apos;t b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from a st@@ able mar@@ ri@@ age , who don &apos;t have as much inv@@ est@@ ed in them , who don &apos;t gro@@ w up in a st@@ able environment , and who go on to become the bot@@ tom three lin@@ es in that gra@@ ph ."
"So once again , we see that these two gra@@ ph@@ s are actually saying the same thing ."
"As before , we &apos;ve got a problem , we &apos;ve got to start working on this , we &apos;ve got to do something , and what &apos;s wrong with you people that you don &apos;t see my thre@@ at ?"
"But if everybody could just take off their parti@@ s@@ an b@@ lin@@ ders , we &apos;d see that these two problems actually are best ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed together ."
"Because if you really care about in@@ come in@@ equ@@ ality , you might want to talk to some ev@@ ang@@ e@@ li@@ cal Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an grou@@ ps that are working on ways to pro@@ mot@@ e mar@@ ri@@ age ."
But then you &apos;re going to run s@@ m@@ ack into the problem that women don &apos;t gener@@ ally want to mar@@ ry someone who doesn &apos;t have a job .
"So if you really care about str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening fam@@ il@@ ies , you might want to talk to some li@@ ber@@ al grou@@ ps who are working on pro@@ mot@@ ing edu@@ c@@ ational equ@@ ality , who are working on ra@@ is@@ ing the min@@ i@@ mu@@ m wa@@ ge , who are working on fin@@ ding ways to stop so many men from being suc@@ ked into the cri@@ min@@ al ju@@ sti@@ ce system and taken out of the mar@@ ri@@ age market for their whole lives ."
"So to con@@ clu@@ de , there are at least four ast@@ er@@ o@@ i@@ ds he@@ ad@@ ed our way ."
How many of you can see all four ?
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand right now if you &apos;re wil@@ ling to ad@@ m@@ it that all four of these are national problems .
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your h@@ ands .
"O@@ kay , almost all of you ."
"Well , con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations , you guys are the in@@ au@@ gu@@ ral mem@@ bers of the A@@ ster@@ o@@ i@@ ds C@@ lub , which is a c@@ lub for all Ameri@@ cans who are wil@@ ling to ad@@ m@@ it that the other side actually might have a point ."
"In the A@@ ster@@ o@@ i@@ ds C@@ lub , we don &apos;t start by looking for common ground ."
C@@ om@@ m@@ on ground is often very hard to find .
"No , we start by looking for common thre@@ ats because common thre@@ ats make common ground ."
"Now , am I being na@@ i@@ ve ? Is it na@@ i@@ ve to think that people could ever l@@ ay down their s@@ words , and left and right could actually work together ?"
"I don &apos;t think so , because it happens , not all that often , but there are a v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of exam@@ ples that point the way ."
This is something we can do .
"Because Ameri@@ cans on both si@@ des care about the dec@@ line in ci@@ vi@@ lity , and they &apos;ve form@@ ed do@@ z@@ ens of organiz@@ ations , at the national level , such as this one , down to many local organiz@@ ations , such as To The V@@ il@@ l@@ age S@@ qu@@ are in T@@ al@@ la@@ ha@@ s@@ see , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , which tries to bring state le@@ ad@@ ers together to help fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ate that sort of working together human relation@@ ship that &apos;s ne@@ cess@@ ary to sol@@ ve F@@ l@@ ori@@ da &apos;s problems ."
"A@@ m@@ eri@@ cans on both si@@ des care about global po@@ ver@@ ty and AIDS , and on so many hum@@ ani@@ t@@ ari@@ an issu@@ es , li@@ ber@@ als and ev@@ ang@@ e@@ li@@ cal@@ s are actually natural al@@ l@@ ies , and at times they really have worked together to sol@@ ve these problems ."
"And most sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly to me , they sometimes can even see ey@@ e to ey@@ e on cri@@ min@@ al ju@@ sti@@ ce ."
"For example , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation r@@ ate , the pri@@ son popul@@ ation in this country has qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ p@@ led since 19@@ 80 ."
"Now this is a social disa@@ ster , and li@@ ber@@ als are very con@@ cer@@ ned about this ."
"The S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Po@@ ver@@ ty L@@ a@@ w C@@ enter is often fi@@ gh@@ ting the pri@@ son@@ -@@ indu@@ stri@@ al comple@@ x , fi@@ gh@@ ting to pre@@ v@@ ent a system that &apos;s just suc@@ king in more and more po@@ or young men ."
But are con@@ ser@@ v@@ ati@@ ves happy about this ?
"Well , G@@ ro@@ ver Nor@@ qui@@ st isn &apos;t , because this system co@@ sts an un@@ belie@@ v@@ able amount of money ."
"And so , because the pri@@ son@@ -@@ indu@@ stri@@ al comple@@ x is ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ ting our st@@ ates and cor@@ ro@@ ding our s@@ ou@@ ls , grou@@ ps of fi@@ sc@@ al con@@ ser@@ v@@ ati@@ ves and Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an con@@ ser@@ v@@ ati@@ ves have come together to form a group called R@@ ight on C@@ ri@@ me ."
And at times they have worked with the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Po@@ ver@@ ty L@@ a@@ w C@@ enter to op@@ pos@@ e the building of new pri@@ s@@ ons and to work for re@@ form@@ s that will make the ju@@ sti@@ ce system more ef@@ fi@@ cient and more hum@@ ane .
So this is possible . We can do it .
"L@@ et us ther@@ e@@ fore go to bat@@ tle st@@ ations , not to fi@@ ght each other , but to beg@@ in def@@ le@@ cting these in@@ coming ast@@ er@@ o@@ i@@ ds ."
"And let our first mis@@ sion be to pre@@ ss Con@@ gre@@ ss to re@@ form itself , before it &apos;s too l@@ ate for our n@@ ation ."
Thank you . ( Applause )
Now I &apos;m going to give you a story .
It &apos;s an Indi@@ an story about an Indi@@ an woman and her jour@@ ney .
Let me beg@@ in with my parents .
I &apos;m a produ@@ ct of this visi@@ on@@ ary mother and father .
"M@@ any years ago , when I was born in the &apos; 5@@ 0s — &apos; 5@@ 0s and &apos; 6@@ 0s didn &apos;t be@@ long to girls in Indi@@ a ."
They be@@ lon@@ g@@ ed to bo@@ ys .
"They be@@ lon@@ g@@ ed to bo@@ ys who would jo@@ in business and in@@ her@@ it business from parents , and girls would be dol@@ led up to get mar@@ ried ."
"My family , in my city , and almost in the country , was uni@@ qu@@ e ."
"We were four of us , not one , and for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely no bo@@ ys ."
We were four girls and no bo@@ ys .
And my parents were part of a lan@@ ded pro@@ per@@ ty family .
"My father def@@ ied his own grand@@ father , almost to the point of dis@@ in@@ h@@ eri@@ t@@ ance , because he decided to edu@@ cate all four of us ."
He s@@ ent us to one of the best scho@@ ols in the city and gave us the best education .
"As I &apos;ve said , when we &apos;re born , we don &apos;t cho@@ ose our parents , and when we go to school , we don &apos;t cho@@ ose our school ."
Ch@@ il@@ dren don &apos;t cho@@ ose a school .
They just get the school which parents cho@@ ose for them .
So this is the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation time which I got .
"I gre@@ w up like this , and so did my other three si@@ st@@ ers ."
"And my father used to say at that time , &quot; I &apos;m going to sp@@ read all my four d@@ augh@@ ters in four cor@@ n@@ ers of the world . &quot;"
"I don &apos;t know if he really me@@ ant &#91; that &#93; , but it happened ."
I &apos;m the only one who &apos;s left in Indi@@ a .
"One is a Bri@@ ti@@ sh , another is an American and the third is a C@@ an@@ ad@@ i@@ an ."
So we are four of us in four cor@@ n@@ ers of the world .
"And since I said they &apos;re my ro@@ le mode@@ ls , I fol@@ low@@ ed two things which my father and mother gave me ."
"One , they said , &quot; &quot; Li@@ fe is on an in@@ c@@ line ."
"You either go up , or you come down . &quot; &quot; And the second thing , which has sta@@ yed with me , which became my phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y of life , which made all the difference , is : 100 things happen in your life , good or bad ."
"O@@ u@@ t of 100 , 90 are your cre@@ ation ."
They &apos;re good . They &apos;re your cre@@ ation . En@@ jo@@ y it .
"If they &apos;re bad , they &apos;re your cre@@ ation . L@@ ear@@ n from it ."
Ten are natu@@ re@@ -@@ s@@ ent over which you can &apos;t do a thing .
"It &apos;s like a death of a rel@@ ative , or a cy@@ cl@@ one , or a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ c@@ ane , or an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
You can &apos;t do a thing about it .
You &apos;ve got to just re@@ spo@@ nd to the situ@@ ation .
But that respon@@ se comes out of those 90 poin@@ ts .
"S@@ in@@ ce I &apos;m a produ@@ ct of this phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y , of 90 / 10 , and secon@@ d@@ ly , &quot; &quot; life on an in@@ c@@ line , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the way I gre@@ w up to be val@@ u@@ ing what I got ."
"I &apos;m a produ@@ ct of opportuni@@ ties , r@@ are opportuni@@ ties in the &apos; 5@@ 0s and the &apos; 6@@ 0s , which girls didn &apos;t get , and I was con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous of the fact that what my parents were gi@@ ving me was something uni@@ qu@@ e ."
"Because all of my best school friends were getting dol@@ led up to get mar@@ ried with a lot of dow@@ ry , and here I was with a ten@@ n@@ is rac@@ k@@ et and going to school and doing all kinds of ex@@ trac@@ ur@@ ri@@ cular acti@@ vi@@ ties ."
I thought I must tell you this .
"Wh@@ y I said this , is the back@@ ground ."
This is what comes next .
"I jo@@ ined the Indi@@ an Po@@ li@@ ce S@@ er@@ vice as a t@@ ough woman , a woman with in@@ def@@ ati@@ g@@ able st@@ am@@ ina , because I used to run for my ten@@ n@@ is ti@@ t@@ les , et@@ c ."
"But I jo@@ ined the Indi@@ an Po@@ li@@ ce S@@ er@@ vice , and then it was a new pat@@ ter@@ n of poli@@ cing ."
"For me the poli@@ cing sto@@ od for power to cor@@ re@@ ct , power to pre@@ v@@ ent and power to de@@ te@@ ct ."
This is something like a new defini@@ tion ever given in poli@@ cing in Indi@@ a — the power to pre@@ v@@ ent .
"Because nor@@ m@@ ally it was always said , power to de@@ te@@ ct , and that &apos;s it , or power to pu@@ ni@@ sh ."
"But I decided no , it &apos;s a power to pre@@ v@@ ent , because that &apos;s what I learned when I was grow@@ ing up ."
How do I pre@@ v@@ ent the 10 and never make it more than 10 ?
"So this was how it came into my ser@@ vice , and it was different from the men ."
"I didn &apos;t want to make it different from the men , but it was different , because this was the way I was different ."
And I re@@ de@@ fin@@ ed poli@@ cing con@@ cep@@ ts in Indi@@ a .
"I &apos;m going to take you on two jour@@ ne@@ ys , my poli@@ cing jour@@ ney and my pri@@ son jour@@ ney ."
"What you see , if you see the ti@@ tle called &quot; &quot; P@@ M &apos;s car he@@ ld . &quot; &quot; This was the first time a pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er of Indi@@ a was given a par@@ king ti@@ ck@@ et ."
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time in Indi@@ a , and I can tell you , that &apos;s the last time you &apos;re hear@@ ing about it ."
"It &apos;ll never happen again in Indi@@ a , because now it was once and fore@@ ver ."
"And the ru@@ le was , because I was sen@@ si@@ tive , I was comp@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ ate , I was very sen@@ si@@ tive to in@@ ju@@ sti@@ ce , and I was very pro@@ -@@ ju@@ sti@@ ce ."
"That &apos;s the reason , as a woman , I jo@@ ined the Indi@@ an Po@@ li@@ ce S@@ er@@ vice ."
"I had other op@@ tions , but I didn &apos;t cho@@ ose them ."
So I &apos;m going to move on .
"This is about t@@ ough poli@@ cing , equ@@ al poli@@ cing ."
"Now I was known as &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a woman that &apos;s not going to list@@ en . &quot; &quot; So I was s@@ ent to all indi@@ sc@@ ri@@ min@@ ate post@@ ings , post@@ ings which others would say no ."
I now went to a pri@@ son as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment as a poli@@ ce offi@@ cer .
Nor@@ m@@ ally poli@@ ce offi@@ c@@ ers don &apos;t want to do pri@@ son .
"They s@@ ent me to pri@@ son to lo@@ ck me up , thinking , &quot; &quot; Now there will be no cars and no V@@ I@@ P@@ s to be given ti@@ c@@ ke@@ ts to ."
Let &apos;s lo@@ ck her up . &quot; &quot; Here I got a pri@@ son as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment .
This was a pri@@ son as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment which was one big den of cri@@ min@@ als .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , it was ."
"But 1@@ 0,000 men , of which only 4@@ 00 were women — 1@@ 0,000 — 9@@ ,000 p@@ lu@@ s about 6@@ 00 were men ."
"T@@ er@@ ro@@ ri@@ sts , ra@@ pi@@ sts , bur@@ gl@@ ars , g@@ ang@@ st@@ ers — some of them I &apos;d s@@ ent to ja@@ il as a poli@@ ce offi@@ cer outside ."
And then how did I deal with them ?
"The first day when I went in , I didn &apos;t know how to look at them ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pra@@ y ? &quot; &quot; When I looked at the group , I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pra@@ y ? &quot; &quot; They saw me as a young , shor@@ t woman we@@ aring a pa@@ than su@@ it . I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pra@@ y ? &quot; &quot;"
And they didn &apos;t say anything .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pra@@ y ? Do you want to pra@@ y ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; All right , let &apos;s pra@@ y . &quot; &quot; I pra@@ yed for them , and things started to change ."
This is a vi@@ su@@ al of education inside the pri@@ son .
"F@@ r@@ ien@@ ds , this has never happened , where everybody in the pri@@ son stud@@ ies ."
I started this with community sup@@ port .
G@@ over@@ n@@ ment had no bud@@ get .
"It was one of the fin@@ est , largest vol@@ un@@ te@@ eri@@ sm in any pri@@ son in the world ."
This was ini@@ ti@@ ated in D@@ el@@ h@@ i pri@@ son .
You see one sam@@ ple of a pri@@ son@@ er teach@@ ing a clas@@ s .
These are hundre@@ ds of clas@@ ses .
"N@@ ine to ele@@ ven , every pri@@ son@@ er went into the education program — the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the b@@ ar and things would be for@@ got@@ ten ."
We con@@ ver@@ ted this into an ash@@ ra@@ m — from a pri@@ son to an ash@@ ra@@ m through education .
I think that &apos;s the bi@@ g@@ ger change .
It was the beginning of a change .
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers were pri@@ son@@ ers . T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers were vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers .
Bo@@ o@@ ks came from d@@ on@@ ated scho@@ ol@@ boo@@ ks .
St@@ ati@@ on@@ ery was d@@ on@@ ated .
"E@@ very@@ thing was d@@ on@@ ated , because there was no bud@@ get of education for the pri@@ son ."
"Now if I &apos;d not done that , it would have been a hel@@ l@@ ho@@ le ."
That &apos;s the second land@@ mar@@ k .
"I want to show you some mom@@ ents of history in my jour@@ ney , which probably you would never ever get to see any@@ where in the world ."
"One , the num@@ bers you &apos;ll never get to see ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , this con@@ cept ."
"This was a medi@@ tation program inside the pri@@ son of over 1@@ ,000 pri@@ son@@ ers ."
One thous@@ and pri@@ son@@ ers who s@@ at in medi@@ tation .
This was one of the most cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous ste@@ ps I took as a pri@@ son gover@@ no@@ r .
And this is what trans@@ form@@ ed .
"You want to know more about this , go and see this film , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ ing Ti@@ me , D@@ o@@ ing V@@ i@@ pas@@ s@@ ana . &quot; &quot; You will hear about it , and you will love it ."
"And write to me on K@@ i@@ ran@@ Be@@ di@@ .@@ co@@ m , and I &apos;ll re@@ spo@@ nd to you ."
Let me show you the next sli@@ de .
"I took the same con@@ cept of min@@ d@@ fu@@ l@@ ness , because , why did I bring medi@@ tation into the Indi@@ an pri@@ son ?"
Because cri@@ me is a produ@@ ct of a di@@ stor@@ ted mind .
It was di@@ stor@@ tion of mind which needed to be ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed to control .
"N@@ ot by pre@@ ach@@ ing , not by tel@@ ling , not by re@@ ading , but by ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sing your mind ."
"I took the same thing to the poli@@ ce , because poli@@ ce , equ@@ ally , were pri@@ son@@ ers of their min@@ ds , and they felt as if it was &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; they , &quot; &quot; and that the people don &apos;t co@@ oper@@ ate ."
This worked .
This is a fe@@ ed@@ back box called a pe@@ ti@@ tion box .
"This is a con@@ cept which I in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced to list@@ en to com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts , list@@ en to gr@@ ie@@ v@@ an@@ ces ."
This was a mag@@ ic box .
This was a sen@@ si@@ tive box .
This is how a pri@@ son@@ er dre@@ w how they felt about the pri@@ son .
"If you see somebody in the blue — ye@@ ah , this guy — he was a pri@@ son@@ er , and he was a teach@@ er ."
"And you see , everybody &apos;s bus@@ y . There was no time to wa@@ ste ."
Let me w@@ ra@@ p it up .
"I &apos;m cur@@ r@@ ently into mov@@ em@@ ents , mov@@ em@@ ents of education of the under@@ -@@ ser@@ ved children , which is thousands — Indi@@ a is all about thousands ."
S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly is about the anti@@ -@@ cor@@ ru@@ ption movement in Indi@@ a .
"That &apos;s a big way we , as a small group of acti@@ vi@@ sts , have dra@@ f@@ ted an om@@ bud@@ s@@ man bi@@ ll for the government of Indi@@ a ."
"F@@ r@@ ien@@ ds , you will hear a lot about it ."
"That &apos;s the movement at the moment I &apos;m dri@@ ving , and that &apos;s the movement and am@@ bi@@ tion of my life ."

"M@@ ob@@ i@@ lity in develo@@ ping world cities is a very pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar challen@@ ge , because different from health or education or h@@ ous@@ ing , it ten@@ ds to get wor@@ se as socie@@ ties become ri@@ ch@@ er ."
"C@@ lear@@ ly , a un@@ susta@@ in@@ able model ."
"M@@ ob@@ i@@ lity , as most other develo@@ ping country problems , more than a matter of money or technology , is a matter of equ@@ ality , e@@ qui@@ ty ."
"O@@ r bi@@ cy@@ cles : F@@ or example , in Am@@ ster@@ d@@ am , more than 30 percent of the popul@@ ation uses bi@@ cy@@ cles , des@@ pi@@ te the fact that the Ne@@ ther@@ l@@ ands has a high@@ er in@@ come per ca@@ pi@@ ta than the United States ."
"There is a con@@ fli@@ ct in develo@@ ping world cities for money , for government inv@@ est@@ ment ."
"If more money is inv@@ est@@ ed in high@@ ways , of course there is less money for h@@ ous@@ ing , for scho@@ ols , for ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s , and also there is a con@@ fli@@ ct for space ."
There is a con@@ fli@@ ct for space between those with cars and those without them .
Mo@@ st of us ac@@ cept today that pri@@ v@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ty and a market econom@@ y is the best way to man@@ age most of society &apos;s re@@ sources .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , there is a problem with that , that market econom@@ y needs in@@ equ@@ ality of in@@ come in order to work ."
"S@@ ome people must make more money , some others less ."
S@@ ome comp@@ an@@ ies suc@@ ce@@ ed . O@@ thers fa@@ il .
I would pro@@ pos@@ e two kinds which both have much to do with cities .
And the second kind of equ@@ ality is one which we could call &quot; &quot; de@@ moc@@ r@@ atic equ@@ ality . &quot; &quot; The first arti@@ cle in every con@@ stitu@@ tion st@@ ates that all ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens are equ@@ al before the la@@ w .
That is not just po@@ e@@ try .
It &apos;s a very powerful prin@@ ci@@ ple .
"For example , if that is true , a bu@@ s with 80 pas@@ sen@@ g@@ ers has a right to 80 times more ro@@ ad space than a car with one ."
"L@@ ess than 100 years ago , women could not v@@ ot@@ e , and it seem@@ ed nor@@ mal , in the same way that it seem@@ s nor@@ mal today to see a bu@@ s in traf@@ fic ."
"We called it T@@ ran@@ s@@ M@@ il@@ eni@@ o , in order to make bus@@ es se@@ x@@ ier ."
"And one thing is that it is also a very beautiful de@@ moc@@ r@@ atic sym@@ bo@@ l , because as bus@@ es z@@ o@@ om by , ex@@ pen@@ sive cars stu@@ ck in traf@@ fic , it c@@ lear@@ ly is almost a picture of de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y at work ."
"In fact , it &apos;s not just a matter of e@@ qui@@ ty ."
It doesn &apos;t take P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . &apos; s .
"In fact , bus@@ es are not se@@ x@@ y , but they are the only possible means to bring mas@@ s tran@@ si@@ t to all are@@ as of f@@ ast grow@@ ing develo@@ ping cities ."
"For example , this system in G@@ u@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou is moving more pas@@ sen@@ g@@ ers our dire@@ ction than all sub@@ way lin@@ es in China , ex@@ cept for one line in Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing , at a f@@ rac@@ tion of the cost ."
"We f@@ ou@@ ght not just for space for bus@@ es , but we f@@ ou@@ ght for space for people , and that was even more difficult ."
"C@@ it@@ ies are human ha@@ bi@@ tat@@ s , and we hum@@ ans are pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans ."
"J@@ ust as fish need to s@@ wi@@ m or bir@@ ds need to f@@ ly or de@@ er need to run , we need to walk ."
"There is a really en@@ or@@ m@@ ous con@@ fli@@ ct , when we are talking about develo@@ ping country cities , between pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans and cars ."
"H@@ ere , what you see is a picture that shows in@@ su@@ f@@ fi@@ cient de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y ."
"H@@ ere they made a f@@ ly@@ over , probably very us@@ el@@ ess , and they for@@ got to make a si@@ de@@ walk ."
This is pre@@ v@@ ail@@ ing all over the world .
N@@ ot even scho@@ ol@@ children are more important than cars .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , I had black ha@@ ir before that ."
It is a very difficult bat@@ tle .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , it was possible , finally , after very difficult bat@@ t@@ les , to make a city that would ref@@ le@@ ct some re@@ spe@@ ct for human di@@ gni@@ ty , that would show that those who walk are equ@@ ally important to those who have cars ."
A city could find oil or di@@ am@@ on@@ ds under@@ ground and it would not be so val@@ u@@ able as ro@@ ad space .
"This is not a technologi@@ cal issue , and we should remember that in no con@@ stitu@@ tion par@@ king is a con@@ stitu@@ ti@@ onal right when we make that di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion ."
"We also built , and this was 15 years ago , before there were bi@@ ke@@ ways in New York or in Par@@ is or in Lon@@ don , it was a very difficult bat@@ tle as well , more than 3@@ 50 kilome@@ ters of prote@@ cted bi@@ cy@@ cle ways ."
I don &apos;t think prote@@ cted bi@@ cy@@ cle ways are a cu@@ te archite@@ ctu@@ ral fe@@ ature .
"They are a right , just as si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks are , un@@ less we believe that only those with ac@@ cess to a mot@@ or ve@@ hi@@ cle have a right to sa@@ fe mo@@ bility , without the ri@@ sk of getting kil@@ led ."
And we are living in a uni@@ qu@@ e moment in history .
But this is not just a matter for develo@@ ping country cities .
"That &apos;s more than all the hom@@ es that today exi@@ st in Bri@@ tain , Fran@@ ce and C@@ an@@ ada put together ."
"And I believe that our cities today have se@@ v@@ ere fl@@ aw@@ s , and that different , better ones could be built ."
What is wrong with our cities today ?
"We have had cities for 8@@ ,000 years , and children could walk out of home and play ."
"In fact , only very re@@ cent@@ ly , towar@@ ds 19@@ 00 , there were no cars ."
C@@ ars have been here for really less than 100 years .
They completely changed cities .
"In 19@@ 00 , for example , no@@ body was kil@@ led by cars in the United States ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 20 years later , between 19@@ 20 and 19@@ 30 , almost 200@@ ,000 people were kil@@ led by cars in the United States ."
"So we could make different cities , cities that will give more pri@@ ori@@ ty to human be@@ ings than to cars , that will give more public space to human be@@ ings than to cars , cities which show great re@@ spe@@ ct for those most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , such as children or the el@@ der@@ ly ."
Ch@@ il@@ dren will walk out of hom@@ es into sa@@ fe sp@@ ac@@ es .
"In new cities which are going to be built , this would not be parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly difficult ."
"And this chang@@ es the way people live , move , en@@ jo@@ y the city ."
"In this picture , you see in one of the very po@@ or neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods , we have a lu@@ x@@ ury pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an bi@@ cy@@ cle stre@@ et , and the cars still in the mu@@ d ."
N@@ in@@ e@@ ty@@ -@@ n@@ ine percent of the people in those neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods don &apos;t have cars .
Th@@ en the city grow@@ s around it .
"And of course this is just a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of something which could be much better if we just create it , and it chang@@ es the way of life ."
"This would be , again , a very low@@ -@@ cost solution if im@@ ple@@ men@@ ted from the start , low cost , ple@@ as@@ ant tran@@ si@@ t with natural su@@ n@@ light ."
And of course it &apos;s very difficult to have mas@@ s tran@@ si@@ t or to use bi@@ cy@@ cles in such environ@@ ments .
"But even leg@@ al develo@@ p@@ ments have also been lo@@ c@@ ated in the wrong places , very far from the city cen@@ ters where it &apos;s im@@ possible to provi@@ de low@@ -@@ cost , high-@@ fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy public transpor@@ t ."
"As a L@@ at@@ in American , and L@@ at@@ in America was the most re@@ cent@@ ly organiz@@ ed regi@@ on in the world , I would re@@ comm@@ end , re@@ spe@@ ct@@ fully , pas@@ si@@ on@@ ately , to those countries which are yet to urb@@ ani@@ ze — L@@ at@@ in America went from 40 percent urb@@ an in 19@@ 50 to 80 percent urb@@ an in 20@@ 10 — I would re@@ comm@@ end A@@ si@@ an and Afri@@ can countries which are yet to urb@@ ani@@ ze , such as Indi@@ a which is only 3@@ 3 percent urb@@ an now , that govern@@ ments should ac@@ qui@@ re all land around cities ."
"In this way , their cities could gro@@ w in the right places with the right sp@@ ac@@ es , with the par@@ ks , with the gre@@ en@@ ways , with the bus@@ ways ."
The cities we are going to build over the next 50 years will de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine qu@@ ality of life and even happ@@ iness for bi@@ llions of people towar@@ ds the future .
"What a fanta@@ stic opportunity for le@@ ad@@ ers and many young le@@ ad@@ ers to come , es@@ pe@@ cially in the develo@@ ping countries ."
They can create a much ha@@ p@@ pie@@ r life for bi@@ llions towar@@ ds the future .
"I am sure , I am op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic , that they will make cities better than our most am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous dre@@ am@@ s ."
( Applause )
I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medi@@ cine that has to change .
"And I think it star@@ ts with one physi@@ ci@@ an , and that &apos;s me ."
"H@@ ey , why not ?"
"We &apos;re ne@@ ar the end , we &apos;re getting close to the World S@@ er@@ ies ."
"We all love bas@@ e@@ ball , don &apos;t we ?"
( Laughter ) B@@ as@@ e@@ ball is fil@@ led with some amazing st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs .
And there &apos;s hundre@@ ds of them .
It &apos;s called bat@@ ting a@@ ver@@ age .
"So we talk about a 3@@ 00 , a bat@@ ter who bat@@ s 3@@ 00 ."
"That means that bal@@ l@@ pla@@ y@@ er bat@@ ted sa@@ fe@@ ly , h@@ it sa@@ fe@@ ly three times out of 10 at bat@@ s ."
Th@@ ree times out of 10 .
Do you know what they call a 3@@ 00 hi@@ t@@ ter in M@@ aj@@ or Le@@ ag@@ ue B@@ as@@ e@@ ball ?
"G@@ o@@ od , really good , maybe an al@@ l-@@ st@@ ar ."
Do you know what they call a 4@@ 00 bas@@ e@@ ball hi@@ t@@ ter ?
"That &apos;s somebody who h@@ it , by the way , four times sa@@ fe@@ ly out of every 10 ."
Le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary — as in T@@ ed W@@ il@@ li@@ am@@ s le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary — the last M@@ aj@@ or Le@@ ag@@ ue B@@ as@@ e@@ ball pla@@ y@@ er to h@@ it over 4@@ 00 during a regu@@ lar se@@ as@@ on .

"( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ how this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?"
Now sup@@ pos@@ e you live in a certain part of a certain re@@ mot@@ e place and you have a lo@@ ved one who has blo@@ ck@@ ages in two co@@ ron@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ ies and your family do@@ ctor ref@@ ers that lo@@ ved one to a car@@ di@@ ologi@@ st who &apos;s bat@@ ting 2@@ 00 on an@@ gi@@ op@@ la@@ st@@ ies .
"But , but , you know what ?"
She &apos;s doing a lot better this year . She &apos;s on the com@@ e@@ back tra@@ il .
And she &apos;s hi@@ tting a 2@@ 5@@ 7 .
S@@ ome@@ how this isn &apos;t working .
But I &apos;m going to ask you a question .
"@@ 1@@ ,000 , very good ."
"Now tru@@ th of the matter is , no@@ body know@@ s in all of medi@@ cine what a good sur@@ ge@@ on or physi@@ ci@@ an or par@@ am@@ e@@ di@@ c is sup@@ posed to b@@ at ."
"What we do though is we sen@@ d each one of them , inclu@@ ding myself , out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ i@@ tion , be perfe@@ ct ."
"N@@ ever ever , ever make a mist@@ ake , but you wor@@ ry about the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s , about how that &apos;s going to happen ."
I was an ob@@ s@@ es@@ sive com@@ pul@@ sive stud@@ ent .
"In high school , a clas@@ s@@ m@@ ate once said that Bri@@ an G@@ ol@@ d@@ man would study for a blo@@ od test ."
And I memor@@ i@@ zed everything .
I even knew the differ@@ enti@@ al di@@ ag@@ no@@ sis in how to clas@@ si@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ lar aci@@ do@@ sis .
"And I did well , I gra@@ du@@ ated with hon@@ ors , cu@@ m l@@ au@@ de ."
"And it worked for a while , until I met M@@ r@@ s. D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er ."
I was a resi@@ dent at a teach@@ ing ho@@ spit@@ al here in T@@ o@@ ron@@ to when M@@ r@@ s. D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er was brought to the em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy de@@ part@@ ment of the ho@@ spit@@ al where I was working .
and to re@@ port back to my at@@ ten@@ ding .
"And I saw M@@ r@@ s. D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er , and she was bre@@ a@@ th@@ less ."
"And when I list@@ en@@ ed to her , she was making a whe@@ e@@ zy sound ."
"And when I list@@ en@@ ed to her ch@@ est with a ste@@ th@@ os@@ cop@@ e , I could hear c@@ rac@@ k@@ ly sounds on both si@@ des that told me that she was in con@@ g@@ esti@@ ve heart fai@@ lu@@ re ."
"This is a con@@ di@@ tion in which the heart fa@@ il@@ s , and instead of being able to pu@@ m@@ p all the blo@@ od forward , some of the blo@@ od bac@@ ks up into the lu@@ n@@ g , the lu@@ n@@ gs fi@@ ll up with blo@@ od , and that &apos;s why you have shor@@ t@@ ness of bre@@ ath ."
I made it and I set to work tre@@ ating her .
I gave her as@@ pi@@ r@@ in . I gave her medi@@ c@@ ations to re@@ lie@@ ve the stra@@ in on her heart .
"I gave her medi@@ c@@ ations that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ ti@@ cs , water pi@@ l@@ ls , to get her to pe@@ e out the ac@@ cess flu@@ id ."
And I felt really good .
And that &apos;s when I made my first mist@@ ake ; I s@@ ent her home .
"A@@ c@@ tually , I made two more mist@@ ak@@ es ."
I s@@ ent her home without spe@@ aking to my at@@ ten@@ ding .
"And he knew her , he would have been able to f@@ ur@@ ni@@ sh ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal information about her ."
Ma@@ ybe I didn &apos;t want to be a high-@@ ma@@ inten@@ ance resi@@ dent .
Ma@@ ybe I wanted to be so suc@@ cess@@ ful and so able to take respon@@ si@@ bility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my at@@ ten@@ ding &apos;s patients without even having to cont@@ act him .
The second mist@@ ake that I made was wor@@ se .
"In fact , so l@@ ac@@ king in con@@ fi@@ dence was I that I actually asked the n@@ ur@@ se who was looking after M@@ r@@ s. D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er , &quot; Do you think it &apos;s o@@ kay if she goes home ? &quot;"
"And the n@@ ur@@ se thought about it and said very mat@@ ter@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ fac@@ tly , &quot; &quot; Yeah , I think she &apos;ll do o@@ kay . &quot; &quot; I can remember that like it was y@@ est@@ er@@ day ."
"So I sig@@ ned the dis@@ char@@ ge pa@@ per@@ s , and an am@@ bu@@ l@@ ance came , par@@ am@@ e@@ di@@ cs came to take her home ."
And I went back to my work on the war@@ ds .
"A@@ ll the rest of that day , that af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , I had this kind of g@@ naw@@ ing feeling inside my st@@ om@@ ach ."
But I car@@ ried on with my work .
"And at the end of the day , I pac@@ ked up to leave the ho@@ spit@@ al and wal@@ ked to the par@@ king lot to take my car and dri@@ ve home when I did something that I don &apos;t usu@@ ally do ."
I wal@@ ked through the em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy de@@ part@@ ment on my way home .
The three words are : Do you remember ?
&quot; Do you remember that patien@@ t you s@@ ent home ? &quot;
the other n@@ ur@@ se asked mat@@ ter@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ fac@@ tly .
"&quot; Well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that t@@ one of vo@@ ice ."
Well she was back all right .
She was back and ne@@ ar death .
"A@@ b@@ out an hour after she had ar@@ ri@@ ved home , after I &apos;d s@@ ent her home , she col@@ lap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the par@@ am@@ e@@ di@@ cs brought her back to the em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy de@@ part@@ ment where she had a blo@@ od pres@@ sure of 50 , which is in se@@ v@@ ere sho@@ ck ."
And she was bar@@ ely bre@@ a@@ thing and she was blue .
And the em@@ er@@ g@@ . st@@ af@@ f pul@@ led out all the stop@@ s .
They gave her medi@@ c@@ ations to ra@@ ise her blo@@ od pres@@ sure .
They put her on a v@@ enti@@ lat@@ or .
And I was sh@@ oc@@ ked and sha@@ k@@ en to the cor@@ e .
"And I went through this rol@@ ler co@@ ast@@ er , because after they st@@ abi@@ liz@@ ed her , she went to the inten@@ sive care uni@@ t , and I hop@@ ed against hope that she would re@@ co@@ ver ."
"And over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wa@@ ke up ."
And the family ga@@ ther@@ ed .
"And over the course of the next eight or n@@ ine days , they re@@ sig@@ ned themselves to what was happening ."
They say you never for@@ get the na@@ mes of those who die .
And that was my first time to be ac@@ qu@@ a@@ in@@ ted with that .
"O@@ ver the next few weeks , I be@@ at myself up and I exper@@ ien@@ ced for the first time the un@@ health@@ y sha@@ me that ex@@ ist@@ s in our culture of medi@@ cine — where I felt alone , is@@ ol@@ ated , not feeling the health@@ y kind of sha@@ me that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es ."
The un@@ health@@ y sha@@ me I &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so si@@ ck inside .
"It &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad ."
And it was what I was feeling .
And it wasn &apos;t because of my at@@ ten@@ ding ; he was a dol@@ l .
And I ke@@ pt as@@ king myself these questions .
Why didn &apos;t I ask my at@@ ten@@ ding ? Why did I sen@@ d her home ?
And then at my wor@@ st mom@@ ents : Why did I make such a stu@@ pi@@ d mist@@ ake ?
Why did I go into medi@@ cine ?
"S@@ low@@ ly but su@@ re@@ ly , it li@@ f@@ ted ."
I began to feel a bit better .
"And I made myself a bar@@ ga@@ in that if only I re@@ d@@ ou@@ ble my ef@@ for@@ ts to be perfe@@ ct and never make another mist@@ ake again , ple@@ ase make the vo@@ i@@ ces stop ."
And they did .
And I went back to work .
And then it happened again .
"It was bus@@ y , I was in a bit of a h@@ ur@@ ry ."
He ke@@ pt poin@@ ting here .
"I looked at his th@@ ro@@ at , it was a little bit p@@ in@@ k ."
"And even as he was wal@@ king out the door , he was still sort of poin@@ ting to his th@@ ro@@ at ."
"And two days later I came to do my next em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy shi@@ ft , and that &apos;s when my ch@@ ie@@ f asked to speak to me qu@@ ie@@ tly in her offi@@ ce ."
&quot; Do you remember that patien@@ t you saw with the sor@@ e th@@ ro@@ at ? &quot;
"Well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a stre@@ p th@@ ro@@ at ."
And for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely he didn &apos;t die .
He was plac@@ ed on in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous anti@@ bi@@ oti@@ cs and he re@@ co@@ vered after a few days .
"And I went through the same per@@ i@@ od of sha@@ me and re@@ cri@@ min@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again ."
"T@@ wi@@ ce in one em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy shi@@ ft , I mis@@ sed app@@ en@@ di@@ ci@@ t@@ is ."
"Now that takes some doing , es@@ pe@@ cially when you work in a ho@@ spit@@ al that at the time saw but 14 people a night ."
"Now in both c@@ ases , I didn &apos;t sen@@ d them home and I don &apos;t think there was any ga@@ p in their care ."
"I or@@ der@@ ed a ki@@ d@@ ney X@@ -@@ ra@@ y . When it turned out to be nor@@ mal , my colle@@ ag@@ ue who was doing a reas@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of the patien@@ t noti@@ ced some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right low@@ er qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ant and called the sur@@ ge@@ ons ."
The other one had a lot of di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a .
I or@@ der@@ ed some flu@@ i@@ ds to re@@ hy@@ d@@ r@@ ate him and asked my colle@@ ag@@ ue to reas@@ s@@ ess him .
"And he did and when he noti@@ ced some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right low@@ er qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ant , called the sur@@ ge@@ ons ."
"In both c@@ ases , they had their oper@@ ations and they did o@@ kay ."
"But each time , they were g@@ naw@@ ing at me , e@@ ating at me ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome of my do@@ oz@@ ies have been in the last five years .
"A@@ l@@ one , as@@ ha@@ med and un@@ sup@@ por@@ ted ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s the problem : If I can &apos;t come cle@@ an and talk about my mist@@ ak@@ es , if I can &apos;t find the st@@ il@@ l-@@ small vo@@ ice that tel@@ ls me what really happened , how can I share it with my colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es ?"
How can I te@@ ach them about what I did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
"If I were to walk into a room — like right now , I have no idea what you think of me ."
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about fai@@ lu@@ re after fai@@ lu@@ re after fai@@ lu@@ re ?
"And in fact , if I knew and my colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es knew that one of my or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es took off the wrong le@@ g in my ho@@ spit@@ al , believe me , I &apos;d have t@@ rou@@ ble making ey@@ e cont@@ act with that person ."
That &apos;s the system that we have .
It &apos;s a comple@@ te d@@ eni@@ al of mist@@ ak@@ es .
"It &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physi@@ ci@@ ans — those who make mist@@ ak@@ es and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t hand@@ le sle@@ ep de@@ pri@@ vation and those who can , those who have l@@ ous@@ y out@@ comes and those who have great out@@ comes ."
But there are two problems with that .
"In this country , as many as 2@@ 4@@ ,000 C@@ an@@ ad@@ i@@ ans die of pre@@ v@@ ent@@ able medi@@ cal er@@ ro@@ r@@ s ."
"In the United States , the In@@ stitu@@ te of Me@@ di@@ cine pe@@ gg@@ ed it at 10@@ 0,000 ."
And here &apos;s the thing .
"In a ho@@ spit@@ al system where medi@@ cal know@@ le@@ dge is d@@ ou@@ b@@ ling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it ."
S@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ vation is absolu@@ tely per@@ v@@ a@@ sive .
We can &apos;t get ri@@ d of it .
"We have our cogni@@ tive bi@@ ases , so that I can take a perfe@@ ct history on a patien@@ t with ch@@ est pa@@ in ."
I &apos;m not a robot ; I don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
And my patients ar@@ en &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s in the same way each time .
"G@@ i@@ ven all of that , mist@@ ak@@ es are in@@ evi@@ table ."
"So if you take the system , as I was t@@ au@@ ght , and we@@ ed out all the er@@ ro@@ r@@ -@@ pro@@ ne health prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als , well there won &apos;t be any@@ body left ."
And you know that business about people not wan@@ ting to talk about their wor@@ st c@@ ases ?
They want to tell their stories . They want to share their stories .
And it star@@ ts with one physi@@ ci@@ an at a time .
She sh@@ ar@@ es her experience with others .
She &apos;s sup@@ por@@ tive when other people talk about their mist@@ ak@@ es .
"And she works in a culture of medi@@ cine that ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ ges that human be@@ ings run the system , and when human be@@ ings run the system , they will make mist@@ ak@@ es from time to time ."
My name is Bri@@ an G@@ ol@@ d@@ man .
I am a re@@ de@@ fin@@ ed physi@@ ci@@ an .
I &apos;m human . I make mist@@ ak@@ es .
"I &apos;m sor@@ ry about that , but I stri@@ ve to learn one thing that I can pas@@ s on to other people ."
"I still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but I can live with that ."
And let me close with three words of my own : I do remember .
( Applause )
"So , well , I do ap@@ pl@@ ied mat@@ h , and this is a pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar problem for any@@ one who does ap@@ pl@@ ied mat@@ h , is that we are like man@@ ag@@ ement con@@ sul@@ tan@@ ts ."
No one know@@ s what the he@@ ll we do .
So I am going to give you some — at@@ tem@@ pt today to try and expla@@ in to you what I do .
"So , dan@@ cing is one of the most human of acti@@ vi@@ ties ."
We de@@ light at bal@@ let vi@@ r@@ tu@@ os@@ os and ta@@ p dan@@ c@@ ers you will see later on .
"Now , bal@@ let requi@@ res an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary level of exper@@ ti@@ se and a high level of sk@@ i@@ ll , and probably a level of ini@@ tial su@@ it@@ ability that may well have a gen@@ e@@ tic com@@ pon@@ ent to it ."
"Now , s@@ ad@@ ly , neuro@@ logi@@ cal di@@ sor@@ ders such as Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ ase gra@@ du@@ ally de@@ stro@@ y this ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an St@@ ri@@ pl@@ ing , who was a vi@@ r@@ tu@@ o@@ so bal@@ let dan@@ cer in his time ."
So great pro@@ gre@@ ss and tre@@ at@@ ment has been made over the years .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , there are 6@@ .@@ 3 million people wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de who have the dise@@ ase , and they have to live with in@@ cu@@ ra@@ ble we@@ ak@@ ness , tre@@ mo@@ r , ri@@ gi@@ di@@ ty and the other sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s that go along with the dise@@ ase , so what we need are obje@@ ctive to@@ ols to de@@ te@@ ct the dise@@ ase before it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
"We need to be able to meas@@ ure pro@@ gre@@ s@@ sion obje@@ cti@@ vely , and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cu@@ re is when we have an obje@@ ctive meas@@ ure that can answer that for sure ."
"But f@@ ru@@ str@@ at@@ ing@@ ly , with Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ ase and other movement di@@ sor@@ ders , there are no bi@@ om@@ ar@@ k@@ ers , so there &apos;s no simple blo@@ od test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20@@ -@@ minu@@ te neuro@@ logi@@ st test ."
"You have to go to the c@@ lin@@ ic to do it . It &apos;s very , very co@@ st@@ ly , and that means that , outside the c@@ lini@@ cal tri@@ als , it &apos;s just never done . It &apos;s never done ."
But what if patients could do this test at home ?
"Now , that would actually sa@@ ve on a difficult tri@@ p to the c@@ lin@@ ic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?"
No ex@@ pen@@ sive st@@ af@@ f time requi@@ red .
"T@@ ak@@ es about $ 3@@ 00 , by the way , in the neuro@@ logi@@ st &apos;s c@@ lin@@ ic to do it ."
"So what I want to pro@@ pos@@ e to you as an un@@ con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal way in which we can try to ach@@ ie@@ ve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all vi@@ r@@ tu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an St@@ ri@@ pl@@ ing ."
So here we have a video of the vi@@ br@@ ating vo@@ cal fol@@ ds .
"Now , this is health@@ y and this is somebody making spe@@ e@@ ch sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vo@@ cal bal@@ let dan@@ c@@ ers , because we have to co@@ ordin@@ ate all of these vo@@ cal or@@ g@@ ans when we make sounds , and we all actually have the gen@@ es for it . F@@ o@@ x@@ P@@ 2 , for example ."
"And like bal@@ let , it takes an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary level of tra@@ ining ."
"I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak ."
"F@@ ro@@ m the sound , we can actually tr@@ ack the vo@@ cal f@@ old posi@@ tion as it vi@@ br@@ ates , and just as the lim@@ b@@ s are af@@ fe@@ cted in Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s , so too are the vo@@ cal or@@ g@@ ans ."
"So on the bot@@ tom tr@@ ace , you can see an example of ir@@ regu@@ lar vo@@ cal f@@ old tre@@ mo@@ r ."
We see all the same sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s .
"We see vo@@ cal tre@@ mo@@ r , we@@ ak@@ ness and ri@@ gi@@ di@@ ty ."
"The spe@@ e@@ ch actually be@@ comes qu@@ ie@@ ter and more bre@@ a@@ th@@ y after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s of it ."
"So these vo@@ cal effe@@ cts can actually be quite sub@@ tle , in some c@@ ases , but with any di@@ gi@@ tal micro@@ phone , and using pre@@ ci@@ sion vo@@ ice an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s so@@ f@@ tw@@ are in com@@ bin@@ ation with the lat@@ est in mach@@ ine lear@@ ning , which is very adv@@ an@@ ced by now , we can now qu@@ anti@@ fy exactly where somebody l@@ ies on a contin@@ u@@ um between health and dise@@ ase using vo@@ ice sig@@ n@@ als alone ."
"So these vo@@ i@@ ce@@ -@@ based te@@ sts , how do they st@@ ack up against exper@@ t c@@ lini@@ cal te@@ sts ? We &apos;ll , they &apos;re both n@@ on-@@ inv@@ a@@ sive ."
The neuro@@ logi@@ st &apos;s test is n@@ on-@@ inv@@ a@@ sive . They both use ex@@ ist@@ ing in@@ fra@@ structure .
You don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s to do it .
"And they &apos;re both ac@@ cur@@ ate . O@@ kay , but in ad@@ di@@ tion , vo@@ i@@ ce@@ -@@ based te@@ sts are n@@ on-@@ exper@@ t ."
That means they can be self-@@ ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er@@ ed .
"They &apos;re high-@@ speed , take about 30 secon@@ ds at most ."
"They &apos;re ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low cost , and we all know what happens ."
"When something be@@ comes ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low cost , it be@@ comes mas@@ si@@ vely sc@@ al@@ able ."
So here are some amazing go@@ als that I think we can deal with now .
We can redu@@ ce logi@@ sti@@ cal difficul@@ ties with patients .
No need to go to the c@@ lin@@ ic for a rou@@ t@@ ine che@@ ck@@ up .
We can do high-@@ fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing to get obje@@ ctive data .
"We can per@@ form low@@ -@@ cost mas@@ s re@@ c@@ ru@@ it@@ ment for c@@ lini@@ cal tri@@ als , and we can make popul@@ ati@@ on-@@ scale scre@@ ening fe@@ a@@ si@@ ble for the first time ."
We have the opportunity to start to sear@@ ch for the early bi@@ om@@ ar@@ k@@ ers of the dise@@ ase before it &apos;s too l@@ ate .
"So , taking the first ste@@ ps towar@@ ds this today , we &apos;re la@@ un@@ ching the Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s V@@ o@@ ice I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative ."
"Wi@@ th A@@ cu@@ la@@ b and P@@ at@@ ien@@ t@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ M@@ e , we &apos;re a@@ im@@ ing to recor@@ d a very large number of vo@@ i@@ ces wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de to colle@@ ct enough data to start to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le these four go@@ als ."
We have local num@@ bers ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble to three qu@@ ar@@ ters of a billion people on the planet .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ one health@@ y or with Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s can call in , che@@ ap@@ ly , and leave recor@@ dings , a few c@@ ents each , and I &apos;m really happy to an@@ n@@ oun@@ ce that we &apos;ve already h@@ it six percent of our tar@@ get just in eight hours ."
"Th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) T@@ om R@@ ie@@ lly : So Ma@@ x , by taking all these sam@@ ples of , let &apos;s say , 1@@ 0,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s health@@ y and who &apos;s not ?"
What are you going to get out of those sam@@ ples ?
"M@@ a@@ x L@@ it@@ tle : Yeah . Yeah . So what will happen is that , during the call you have to indi@@ cate whether or not you have the dise@@ ase or not , you see . T@@ R : R@@ ight ."
"M@@ L : You see , some people may not do it . They may not get through it ."
"But we &apos;ll get a very large sam@@ ple of data that is colle@@ cted from all different cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces , and it &apos;s getting it in different cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces that matter because then we are looking at i@@ ron@@ ing out the con@@ f@@ oun@@ ding fac@@ t@@ ors , and looking for the ac@@ tu@@ al mark@@ ers of the dise@@ ase ."
T@@ R : So you &apos;re 8@@ 6 percent ac@@ cur@@ ate right now ?
M@@ L : It &apos;s much better than that .
"A@@ c@@ tually , my stud@@ ent Th@@ an@@ a@@ sis , I have to p@@ lu@@ g him , because he &apos;s done some fanta@@ stic work , and now he has pro@@ ved that it works over the mo@@ bi@@ le tele@@ phone network as well , which en@@ ab@@ les this project , and we &apos;re getting 9@@ 9 percent ac@@ cu@@ rac@@ y ."
"T@@ R : N@@ in@@ e@@ ty@@ -@@ n@@ ine . Well , that &apos;s an impro@@ v@@ ement ."
"So what that means is that people will be able to — M@@ L : ( L@@ augh@@ s ) T@@ R : Pe@@ ople will be able to call in from their mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones and do this test , and people with Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s could call in , recor@@ d their vo@@ ice , and then their do@@ ctor can che@@ ck up on their pro@@ gre@@ ss , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the dise@@ ase ."
M@@ L : A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely .
"T@@ R : Th@@ an@@ ks so much . Ma@@ x L@@ it@@ tle , everybody ."
"M@@ L : Th@@ an@@ ks , T@@ om . ( Applause )"
"The public de@@ b@@ ate about archite@@ cture quite often just sta@@ ys on con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating the fin@@ al resul@@ t , the archite@@ ctu@@ ral obje@@ ct ."
Is the lat@@ est tow@@ er in Lon@@ don a gh@@ er@@ k@@ in or a sa@@ us@@ age or a se@@ x to@@ ol ?
"So re@@ cent@@ ly , we asked ourselves if we could inv@@ ent a form@@ at that could actually tell the stories behind the proje@@ cts , maybe com@@ b@@ ining images and d@@ raw@@ ings and words to actually sort of tell stories about archite@@ cture ."
"And we disco@@ vered that we didn &apos;t have to inv@@ ent it , it already ex@@ ist@@ ed in the form of a com@@ ic book ."
"So we basically cop@@ ied the form@@ at of the com@@ ic book to actually tell the stories of behind the scen@@ es , how our proje@@ cts actually ev@@ ol@@ ve through ad@@ ap@@ tation and impro@@ vi@@ s@@ ation ."
S@@ or@@ t of through the tur@@ mo@@ il and the opportuni@@ ties and the in@@ ci@@ d@@ ents of the real world .
"We call this com@@ ic book &quot; &quot; Yes is M@@ ore , &quot; &quot; which is obvi@@ ously a sort of ev@@ olution of the ideas of some of our her@@ o@@ es ."
In this case it &apos;s M@@ ies v@@ an der Ro@@ he &apos;s L@@ ess is M@@ ore .
He tri@@ gg@@ er@@ ed the moder@@ ni@@ st re@@ v@@ olution .
"A@@ f@@ ter him fol@@ low@@ ed the post@@ -@@ moder@@ n coun@@ ter@@ -@@ re@@ v@@ olution , Rob@@ er@@ t V@@ en@@ tur@@ i saying , &quot; &quot; L@@ ess is a bor@@ e . &quot; &quot; Af@@ ter him , P@@ hi@@ li@@ p Joh@@ n@@ son sort of in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced ( Laughter ) you could say pro@@ mis@@ cu@@ ity , or at least open@@ ness to new ideas with , &quot; &quot; I am a wh@@ ore . &quot; &quot; Re@@ cent@@ ly , O@@ b@@ ama has in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m at a sort of time of global fin@@ an@@ cial cri@@ sis ."
"And what we &apos;d like to say with &quot; &quot; Yes is M@@ ore &quot; &quot; is basically trying to question this idea that the archite@@ ctu@@ ral av@@ an@@ t-@@ gar@@ de is almost always neg@@ ati@@ vely de@@ fin@@ ed , as who or what we are against ."
The cli@@ ch@@ e of the radi@@ cal archite@@ ct is the sort of ang@@ ry young man re@@ be@@ l@@ ling against the est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment .
"O@@ r this idea of the mi@@ su@@ n@@ der@@ sto@@ od g@@ eni@@ us , f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated that the world doesn &apos;t f@@ it in with his or her ideas ."
"R@@ a@@ ther than re@@ v@@ olution , we &apos;re much more interested in ev@@ olution , this idea that things gra@@ du@@ ally ev@@ ol@@ ve by ad@@ ap@@ ting and impro@@ vi@@ sing to the chang@@ es of the world ."
"In fact , I actually think that D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n is one of the people who best expla@@ ins our design process ."
H@@ is fam@@ ous ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary t@@ ree could almost be a di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m of the way we work .
"As you can see , a project ev@@ ol@@ ves through a ser@@ ies of gener@@ ations of design me@@ et@@ ings ."
"A@@ t each me@@ e@@ ting , there &apos;s way too many ideas ."
O@@ n@@ ly the best ones can survi@@ ve .
"And through a process of archite@@ ctu@@ ral se@@ le@@ ction , we might cho@@ ose a really beautiful model or we might have a very fun@@ cti@@ onal model ."
We m@@ ate them . They have sort of mu@@ t@@ ant of@@ f@@ sp@@ ring .
And through these sort of gener@@ ations of design me@@ et@@ ings we ar@@ ri@@ ve at a design .
A very liter@@ al way of show@@ ing it is a project we did for a li@@ br@@ ary and a hot@@ el in C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en .
"The design process was really t@@ ough , almost like a stru@@ gg@@ le for survi@@ v@@ al , but gra@@ du@@ ally an idea ev@@ olved : this sort of idea of a r@@ ational tow@@ er that me@@ l@@ ts together with the sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding city , sort of ex@@ pan@@ ding the public space on@@ to what we ref@@ er to as a S@@ c@@ and@@ in@@ avi@@ an ver@@ sion of the S@@ p@@ ani@@ sh Ste@@ ps in R@@ ome , but sort of public on the outside , as well as on the inside , with the li@@ br@@ ary ."
But D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n doesn &apos;t only expla@@ in the ev@@ olution of a single idea .
"As you can see , sometimes a sub@@ species bran@@ ch@@ es off ."
And quite often we si@@ t in a design me@@ e@@ ting and we disco@@ ver that there is this great idea .
It doesn &apos;t really work in this con@@ te@@ xt .
"But for another cl@@ ien@@ t in another culture , it could really be the right answer to a different question ."
"So as a resul@@ t , we never th@@ row anything out ."
We keep our offi@@ ce almost like an archi@@ ve of archite@@ ctu@@ ral bi@@ od@@ i@@ versity .
You never know when you might need it .
"And what I &apos;d like to do now , in an act of war@@ p@@ -@@ speed stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ling , is tell the story of how two proje@@ cts ev@@ olved by ad@@ ap@@ ting and impro@@ vi@@ sing to the happen@@ stance of the world ."
The first story star@@ ts last year when we went to S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i to do the compe@@ ti@@ tion for the D@@ ani@@ sh N@@ ational P@@ avi@@ li@@ on for the World E@@ x@@ po in 20@@ 10 .
"And we saw this guy , Ha@@ i@@ ba@@ o ."
"He &apos;s the mas@@ co@@ t of the ex@@ po , and he looks str@@ ang@@ ely fami@@ li@@ ar ."
In fact he looked like a building we had desig@@ ned for a hot@@ el in the nor@@ th of S@@ we@@ den .
"When we sub@@ mi@@ t@@ ted it for the S@@ we@@ di@@ sh compe@@ ti@@ tion we thought it was a really cool s@@ che@@ me , but it didn &apos;t exactly look like something from the nor@@ th of S@@ we@@ den ."
The S@@ we@@ di@@ sh j@@ ury didn &apos;t think so either . So we lost .
"But then we had a me@@ e@@ ting with a Chin@@ ese bus@@ in@@ ess@@ man who saw our design and said , &quot; W@@ ow , that &apos;s the Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter for the word &apos; people . &apos; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , ap@@ par@@ ently this is how you write &quot; &quot; people , &quot; &quot; as in the Pe@@ ople &apos;s Re@@ public of China ."
We even d@@ ou@@ ble che@@ cked .
"And at the same time , we got in@@ vi@@ ted to ex@@ hi@@ bit at the S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i C@@ re@@ ative In@@ du@@ stry W@@ e@@ ek ."
"So we thought like , this is too much of an opportunity , so we hi@@ red a f@@ en@@ g sh@@ u@@ i ma@@ ster ."
"We sc@@ al@@ ed the building up three times to Chin@@ ese pro@@ por@@ tions , and went to China ."
"( Laughter ) So the Pe@@ ople &apos;s Bu@@ il@@ ding , as we called it ."
"This is our two inter@@ pre@@ ters , sort of re@@ ading the archite@@ cture ."
"It went on the co@@ ver of the W@@ en W@@ e@@ i Po ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er , which got M@@ r. Li@@ ang@@ y@@ u Ch@@ en , the ma@@ y@@ or of S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i , to visi@@ t the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion ."
And we had the ch@@ ance to expla@@ in the project .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i is the city in the world with most sk@@ y@@ sc@@ ra@@ per@@ s , &quot; &quot; but to him it was as if the conne@@ ction to the ro@@ ots had been cut over ."
"And with the Pe@@ ople &apos;s Bu@@ il@@ ding , he saw an archite@@ cture that could bri@@ dge the ga@@ p between the an@@ cient wi@@ s@@ dom of China and the pro@@ gre@@ s@@ sive future of China ."
So we obvi@@ ously prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly ag@@ re@@ ed with him .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , M@@ r. Ch@@ en is now in pri@@ son for cor@@ ru@@ ption . ( Laughter )"
"But like I said , Ha@@ i@@ ba@@ o looked very fami@@ li@@ ar , because he is actually the Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter for &quot; &quot; people . &quot; &quot; And they cho@@ se this mas@@ co@@ t because the the@@ me of the ex@@ po is &quot; &quot; Be@@ t@@ ter C@@ ity , Be@@ t@@ ter Li@@ fe . &quot; &quot; Su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability ."
"And we thought , susta@@ in@@ ability has grow@@ n into being this sort of ne@@ o@@ -@@ Pro@@ test@@ ant idea that it has to h@@ ur@@ t in order to do good ."
"You know , you &apos;re not sup@@ posed to take long , war@@ m show@@ ers ."
You &apos;re not sup@@ posed to f@@ ly on ho@@ li@@ days because it &apos;s bad for the environment .
"G@@ ra@@ du@@ ally , you get this idea that susta@@ in@@ able life is less fun than nor@@ mal life ."
So we thought that maybe it could be interesting to fo@@ cus on exam@@ ples where a susta@@ in@@ able city actually incre@@ ases the qu@@ ality of life .
"We also asked ourselves , what could D@@ en@@ mar@@ k possi@@ bly show China that would be rele@@ v@@ ant ?"
"You know , it &apos;s one of the bi@@ ggest countries in the world , one of the s@@ mal@@ l@@ est ."
China sym@@ bo@@ liz@@ ed by the dra@@ g@@ on .
"D@@ en@@ mar@@ k , we have a national bir@@ d , the s@@ wa@@ n ."
"( Laughter ) China has many great po@@ ets , but we disco@@ vered that in the Pe@@ ople &apos;s Re@@ public public school cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m , they have three fai@@ ry tal@@ es by A@@ n T@@ u S@@ h@@ en@@ g , or H@@ ans Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an An@@ der@@ son , as we call him ."
"So that means that all 1@@ .@@ 3 billion Chin@@ ese have grow@@ n up with &quot; &quot; The E@@ m@@ per@@ or &apos;s New C@@ lo@@ the@@ s , &quot; &quot; &quot; The M@@ at@@ ch@@ sti@@ ck G@@ ir@@ l &quot; and &quot; The L@@ it@@ tle M@@ er@@ ma@@ id . &quot;"
It &apos;s almost like a fra@@ g@@ ment of D@@ ani@@ sh culture inte@@ gr@@ ated into Chin@@ ese culture .
The bi@@ ggest tou@@ ri@@ st at@@ trac@@ tion in China is the Gre@@ at W@@ all .
The Gre@@ at W@@ all is the only thing that can be seen from the mo@@ on .
The big tou@@ ri@@ st at@@ trac@@ tion in D@@ en@@ mar@@ k is The L@@ it@@ tle M@@ er@@ ma@@ id .
That can actually har@@ d@@ ly be seen from the can@@ al t@@ ours .
( Laughter ) And it sort of shows the difference between these two cities .
"C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en , S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i , moder@@ n , Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an ."
"But then we looked at re@@ cent urb@@ an develo@@ pment , and we noti@@ ced that this is like a S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i stre@@ et , 30 years ago . All bi@@ k@@ es , no cars ."
This is how it looks today ; all traf@@ fic j@@ am .
Bi@@ cy@@ cles have become for@@ bi@@ d@@ den many places .
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , in C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en we &apos;re actually ex@@ pan@@ ding the bi@@ cy@@ cle lan@@ es ."
A third of all the people com@@ mu@@ te by bi@@ ke .
We have a f@@ ree system of bi@@ cy@@ cles called the C@@ ity Bi@@ ke that you can bor@@ row if you visi@@ t the city .
"So we thought , why don &apos;t we re@@ in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce the bi@@ cy@@ cle in China ?"
"We d@@ on@@ ate 1@@ ,000 bi@@ k@@ es to S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i ."
"So if you come to the ex@@ po , go stra@@ ight to the D@@ ani@@ sh pa@@ vi@@ li@@ on , get a D@@ ani@@ sh bi@@ ke , and then contin@@ ue on that to visi@@ t the other pa@@ vi@@ li@@ ons ."
"L@@ i@@ ke I said , S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i and C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en are both port cities , but in C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en the water has got@@ ten so cle@@ an that you can actually s@@ wi@@ m in it ."
"One of the first proje@@ cts we ever did was the har@@ b@@ or b@@ ath in C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en , sort of contin@@ u@@ ing the public re@@ al@@ m into the water ."
"So we thought that these ex@@ po@@ s quite often have a lot of state fin@@ an@@ ced pro@@ p@@ ag@@ an@@ da , images , stat@@ em@@ ents , but no real experience ."
"So just like with a bi@@ ke , we don &apos;t talk about it ."
You can try it .
"L@@ i@@ ke with the water , instead of talking about it , we &apos;re going to sa@@ il a million li@@ ters of har@@ b@@ or water from C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en to S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i , so the Chin@@ ese who have the cou@@ ra@@ ge can actually di@@ ve in and feel how cle@@ an it is ."
This is where people nor@@ m@@ ally obje@@ ct that it doesn &apos;t sound very susta@@ in@@ able to sa@@ il water from C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en to China .
"But in fact , the con@@ tain@@ er ships go full of go@@ ods from China to D@@ en@@ mar@@ k , and then they sa@@ il em@@ p@@ ty back ."
So quite often you lo@@ ad water for bal@@ last .
So we can actually hi@@ t@@ ch a ri@@ de for f@@ ree .
"And in the mi@@ ddle of this sort of har@@ b@@ or b@@ ath , we &apos;re actually going to put the ac@@ tu@@ al L@@ it@@ tle M@@ er@@ ma@@ id ."
"So the real M@@ er@@ ma@@ id , the real water , and the real bi@@ k@@ es ."
"And when she &apos;s gone , we &apos;re going to in@@ vi@@ te a Chin@@ ese arti@@ st to re@@ inter@@ pre@@ t her ."
The archite@@ cture of the pa@@ vi@@ li@@ on is this sort of loo@@ p of ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion and bi@@ k@@ es .
"When you go to the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion , you &apos;ll see the M@@ er@@ ma@@ id and the po@@ ol ."
"You &apos;ll walk around , start looking for a bi@@ cy@@ cle on the ro@@ of , j@@ um@@ p on your ri@@ de and then contin@@ ue out into the rest of the ex@@ po ."
So when we actually won the compe@@ ti@@ tion we had to do an ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion in China expla@@ ining the project .
And to our sur@@ pri@@ se we got one of our bo@@ ar@@ ds back with cor@@ re@@ ctions from the Chin@@ ese state cen@@ sor@@ ship .
"The first thing , the China ma@@ p mis@@ sed T@@ a@@ i@@ wa@@ n ."
It &apos;s a very seri@@ ous poli@@ tical issue in China . We will ad@@ d on .
"The second thing , we had com@@ par@@ ed the s@@ wa@@ n to the dra@@ g@@ on , and then the Chin@@ ese state said , &quot; Su@@ ggest change to pan@@ da . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , when it came out in D@@ en@@ mar@@ k that we were actually going to move our national mon@@ um@@ ent , the N@@ ational Pe@@ ople &apos;s Par@@ ty sort of re@@ be@@ l@@ led against it ."
They tr@@ ied to pas@@ s a la@@ w against moving the M@@ er@@ ma@@ id .
"So for the first time , I got in@@ vi@@ ted to speak at the N@@ ational Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent ."
"It was kind of interesting because in the morning , from 9 to 11 , they were di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing the ba@@ il@@ out pac@@ k@@ age — how many bi@@ llions to inv@@ est in sa@@ ving the D@@ ani@@ sh econom@@ y ."
And then at 11 o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck they stop@@ ped talking about these little issu@@ es .
"And then from 11 to 1 , they were de@@ b@@ ating whether or not to sen@@ d the M@@ er@@ ma@@ id to China ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But to con@@ clu@@ de , if you want to see the M@@ er@@ ma@@ id from M@@ ay to De@@ c@@ em@@ ber next year , don &apos;t come to C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en , because she &apos;s going to be in S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i ."
"If you do come to C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en , you will probably see an in@@ stal@@ l@@ ation by A@@ i W@@ ei@@ we@@ i , the Chin@@ ese arti@@ st ."
"But if the Chin@@ ese government inter@@ ven@@ es , it might even be a pan@@ da ."
"( Laughter ) So the second story that I &apos;d like to tell is , actually star@@ ts in my own house ."
This is my a@@ part@@ ment .
"This is the view from my a@@ part@@ ment , over the sort of land@@ s@@ cape of tri@@ ang@@ ul@@ ar bal@@ con@@ ies that our cl@@ ien@@ t called the Le@@ on@@ ar@@ do D@@ i@@ C@@ ap@@ ri@@ o bal@@ con@@ y ."
"And they form this sort of ver@@ tical back@@ y@@ ard where , on a nice sum@@ m@@ er day , you &apos;ll actually get in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced to all your neigh@@ b@@ ors in a ver@@ tical radi@@ us of 10 me@@ ters ."
The house is sort of a di@@ stor@@ tion of a squ@@ are blo@@ ck .
"T@@ ry@@ ing to zi@@ g@@ za@@ g it to make sure that all of the a@@ part@@ ments look at the stra@@ ight vie@@ ws , instead of into each other ."
"U@@ n@@ til re@@ cent@@ ly , this was the view from my a@@ part@@ ment , on@@ to this place where our cl@@ ien@@ t actually b@@ ou@@ ght the neigh@@ b@@ or site ."
And he said that he was going to do an a@@ part@@ ment blo@@ ck next to a par@@ king structure .
"And we thought , rather than doing a tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal st@@ ack of a@@ part@@ ments looking stra@@ ight into a big bor@@ ing blo@@ ck of cars , why don &apos;t we turn all the a@@ part@@ ments into pen@@ thou@@ ses , put them on a po@@ di@@ um of cars ."
"And because C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en is completely f@@ lat , if you want to have a nice s@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ fac@@ ing s@@ lo@@ pe with a view , you basically have to do it yourself ."
"Th@@ en we sort of cut up the v@@ olu@@ me , so we wouldn &apos;t blo@@ ck the view from my a@@ part@@ ment ."
( Laughter ) And essen@@ ti@@ ally the par@@ king is sort of oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ying the de@@ ep space under@@ ne@@ ath the a@@ part@@ ments .
"And up in the su@@ n , you have a single la@@ y@@ er of a@@ part@@ ments that com@@ b@@ ine all the sp@@ len@@ d@@ ors of a su@@ bur@@ b@@ an li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le , like a house with a gar@@ den with a sort of me@@ tro@@ po@@ lit@@ an view , and a sort of den@@ se urb@@ an lo@@ cation ."
This is our first archite@@ ctu@@ ral model .
This is an a@@ eri@@ al ph@@ oto taken last sum@@ m@@ er .
"And essen@@ ti@@ ally , the a@@ part@@ ments co@@ ver the par@@ king ."
They are ac@@ cess@@ ed through this di@@ ag@@ onal ele@@ v@@ ator .
"It &apos;s actually a stan@@ d-@@ up produ@@ ct from S@@ wit@@ zer@@ land , because in S@@ wit@@ zer@@ land they have a natural need for di@@ ag@@ onal ele@@ v@@ at@@ ors ."
"( Laughter ) And the fac@@ ade of the par@@ king , we wanted to make the par@@ king natur@@ ally v@@ enti@@ lated , so we needed to per@@ for@@ ate it ."
"And we disco@@ vered that by contro@@ l@@ ling the size of the ho@@ les , we could actually turn the entire fac@@ ade into a gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic , natur@@ ally v@@ enti@@ lated , ra@@ st@@ eri@@ zed image ."
"And since we always ref@@ er to the project as The M@@ oun@@ tain , we com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed this J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ ya photograph@@ er to give us this beautiful ph@@ oto of M@@ oun@@ t E@@ ver@@ est , making the entire building a 3@@ ,000 squ@@ are me@@ ter ar@@ t@@ work ."
"( Applause ) So if you go back into the par@@ king , into the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors , it &apos;s almost like tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing into a par@@ al@@ le@@ l universe from cars and col@@ ors , into this sort of s@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ fac@@ ing urb@@ an o@@ a@@ sis ."
The wood of your a@@ part@@ ment contin@@ u@@ es outside be@@ coming the fac@@ a@@ des .
"If you go even f@@ ur@@ ther , it turns into this green gar@@ den ."
And all the ra@@ in@@ water that dro@@ ps on the M@@ oun@@ tain is actually ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ lated .
"And there is an au@@ tom@@ atic ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation system that makes sure that this sort of land@@ s@@ cape of gar@@ den@@ s , in one or two years it will sort of trans@@ form into a C@@ am@@ bod@@ i@@ an tem@@ ple ru@@ in , completely co@@ vered in green ."
"So , the M@@ oun@@ tain is like our first built example of what we like to ref@@ er to as archite@@ ctu@@ ral al@@ che@@ my ."
"This idea that you can actually create , if not g@@ old , then at least ad@@ ded val@@ ue by mi@@ x@@ ing tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ ts , like nor@@ mal a@@ part@@ ments and nor@@ mal par@@ king , and in this case actually of@@ f@@ er people the ch@@ ance that they don &apos;t have to cho@@ ose between a life with a gar@@ den or a life in the city ."
They can actually have both .
"As an archite@@ ct , it &apos;s really hard to set the ag@@ en@@ da ."
"You can &apos;t just say that now I &apos;d like to do a susta@@ in@@ able city in cent@@ ral A@@ si@@ a , because that &apos;s not really how you get com@@ mis@@ sions ."
"You always have to sort of ad@@ ap@@ t and impro@@ vi@@ se to the opportuni@@ ties and ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents that happen , and the sort of tur@@ mo@@ il of the world ."
"One last example is that re@@ cent@@ ly we , like last sum@@ m@@ er , we won the compe@@ ti@@ tion to design a Nor@@ di@@ c national b@@ ank ."
This was the dire@@ ctor of the b@@ ank when he was still smi@@ ling .
( Laughter ) It was in the mi@@ ddle of the ca@@ pi@@ tal so we were really exci@@ ted by this opportunity .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , it was the national b@@ ank of I@@ cel@@ and ."
"A@@ t the same time , we actually had a visi@@ tor — a min@@ ist@@ er from A@@ zer@@ ba@@ i@@ j@@ an came to our offi@@ ce ."
"We took him to see the M@@ oun@@ tain . And he got very exci@@ ted by this idea that you could actually make m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins out of archite@@ cture , because A@@ zer@@ ba@@ i@@ j@@ an is known as the Al@@ ps of C@@ ent@@ ral A@@ si@@ a ."
So he asked us if we could actually imagine an urb@@ an ma@@ ster pl@@ an on an is@@ land outside the ca@@ pi@@ tal that would re@@ create the sil@@ hou@@ et@@ te of the seven most sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of A@@ zer@@ ba@@ i@@ j@@ an .
So we took the com@@ mis@@ sion .
And we made this small movie that I &apos;d like to show .
We quite often make little mov@@ ies .
"We always ar@@ gu@@ e a lot about the soun@@ d@@ tr@@ ack , but in this case it was really e@@ asy to cho@@ ose the s@@ ong ."
"So basically , B@@ ak@@ u is this sort of cre@@ sc@@ ent b@@ ay over@@ looking the is@@ land of Z@@ ir@@ a , the is@@ land that we are plan@@ ning — almost like the di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m of their f@@ la@@ g ."
"And our ma@@ in idea was to sort of sam@@ ple the seven most sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of the to@@ po@@ gra@@ ph@@ y of A@@ zer@@ ba@@ i@@ j@@ an and re@@ inter@@ pre@@ t them into urb@@ an and archite@@ ctu@@ ral stru@@ ctures , in@@ ha@@ bi@@ table of human life ."
"Th@@ en we place these m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins on the is@@ land , sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding this sort of cent@@ ral green val@@ ley , almost like a cent@@ ral par@@ k ."
And what makes it interesting is that the is@@ land right now is just a piece of des@@ er@@ t . It has no ve@@ ge@@ tation .
"It has no water . It has no energy , no re@@ sources ."
"So we actually sort of desig@@ ned the entire is@@ land as a single e@@ co@@ system , ex@@ plo@@ i@@ ting wind energy to dri@@ ve the des@@ al@@ in@@ ation plan@@ ts , and to use the ther@@ mal pro@@ per@@ ties of water to he@@ at and cool the buil@@ dings ."
"And all the sort of ex@@ cess fre@@ sh@@ water wa@@ ste@@ water is fil@@ ter@@ ed organi@@ cally into the land@@ s@@ cape , gra@@ du@@ ally trans@@ form@@ ing the des@@ er@@ t is@@ land into sort of a green , l@@ us@@ h land@@ s@@ cape ."
"So , you can say where an urb@@ an develo@@ pment nor@@ m@@ ally happens at the ex@@ pen@@ se of nature , in this case it &apos;s actually cre@@ ating nature ."
"And the buil@@ dings , they don &apos;t only sort of inv@@ o@@ ke the imag@@ ery of the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins , they also oper@@ ate like m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ."
They create sh@@ el@@ ter from the wind .
They ac@@ cu@@ mul@@ ate the solar energy .
They ac@@ cu@@ mul@@ ate the water .
So they actually trans@@ form the entire is@@ land into a single e@@ co@@ system .
"So we re@@ cent@@ ly pre@@ sen@@ ted the ma@@ ster pl@@ an , and it has got@@ ten appro@@ ved ."
"And this sum@@ m@@ er we are star@@ ting the con@@ stru@@ ction do@@ cu@@ ments of the two first m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins , in what &apos;s going to be the first car@@ b@@ on-@@ neu@@ tra@@ l is@@ land in C@@ ent@@ ral A@@ si@@ a ."
"( Applause ) Yes , maybe just to round off ."
So in a way you can see how the M@@ oun@@ tain in C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en sort of ev@@ olved into the S@@ even Pe@@ ak@@ s of A@@ zer@@ ba@@ i@@ j@@ an .
"Wi@@ th a little lu@@ ck and some more ev@@ olution , maybe in 10 years it could be the F@@ i@@ ve M@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins on Mars ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"O@@ n my des@@ k in my offi@@ ce , I keep a small cl@@ ay po@@ t that I made in colle@@ ge . It &apos;s ra@@ ku , which is a kind of pot@@ tery that began in J@@ ap@@ an cen@@ tur@@ ies ago as a way of making bow@@ ls for the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese te@@ a cer@@ em@@ ony ."
This one is more than 4@@ 00 years old .
"E@@ ach one was p@@ in@@ ched or car@@ ved out of a ball of cl@@ ay , and it was the im@@ perfe@@ ctions that people ch@@ eri@@ shed ."
E@@ very@@ day po@@ ts like this cu@@ p take eight to 10 hours to fi@@ re .
"I just took this out of the kil@@ n last week , and the kil@@ n itself takes another day or two to cool down , but ra@@ ku is really f@@ ast . You do it outside , and you take the kil@@ n up to temper@@ ature . In 15 minutes , it goes to 1@@ ,@@ 500 de@@ gre@@ es , and as so@@ on as you see that the g@@ la@@ ze has me@@ l@@ ted inside , you can see that fa@@ int sh@@ e@@ en , you turn the kil@@ n off , and you re@@ ach in with these long me@@ tal ton@@ gs , you gra@@ b the po@@ t , and in J@@ ap@@ an , this re@@ d-@@ ho@@ t po@@ t would be im@@ medi@@ ately im@@ mer@@ sed in a solution of green te@@ a , and you can imagine what that ste@@ am would s@@ me@@ ll like ."
"But here in the United States , we ra@@ m@@ p up the dra@@ ma a little bit , and we dro@@ p our po@@ ts into sa@@ w@@ d@@ ust , which cat@@ ch@@ es on fi@@ re , and you take a gar@@ b@@ age pa@@ il , and you put it on top , and smo@@ ke star@@ ts po@@ ur@@ ing out ."
I would come home with my clo@@ the@@ s re@@ e@@ king of wo@@ od@@ smo@@ ke .
I love ra@@ ku because it allow@@ s me to play with the ele@@ ments .
"I can sha@@ pe a po@@ t out of cl@@ ay and cho@@ ose a g@@ la@@ ze , but then I have to let it go to the fi@@ re and the smo@@ ke , and what &apos;s wonderful is the sur@@ pri@@ ses that happen , like this c@@ rac@@ k@@ le pat@@ ter@@ n , because it &apos;s really stre@@ s@@ s@@ ful on these po@@ ts . They go from 1@@ ,@@ 500 de@@ gre@@ es to room temper@@ ature in the space of just a minu@@ te ."
R@@ ak@@ u is a wonderful me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or for the process of cre@@ ati@@ vity .
"I find in so many things that ten@@ sion between what I can control and what I have to let go happens all the time , whether I &apos;m cre@@ ating a new radi@@ o show or just at home neg@@ oti@@ ating with my te@@ en@@ age s@@ ons ."
"When I s@@ at down to write a book about cre@@ ati@@ vity , I realized that the ste@@ ps were re@@ ver@@ sed ."
"I had to let go at the very beginning , and I had to im@@ mer@@ se myself in the stories of hundre@@ ds of arti@@ sts and wri@@ ters and musi@@ ci@@ ans and fil@@ m@@ mak@@ ers , and as I list@@ en@@ ed to these stories , I realized that cre@@ ati@@ vity grow@@ s out of every@@ day exper@@ ien@@ ces more often than you might think , inclu@@ ding le@@ tting go ."
"It was sup@@ posed to bre@@ ak , but that &apos;s o@@ kay . ( Laughter ) ( L@@ augh@@ s ) That &apos;s part of the le@@ tting go , is sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , because cre@@ ati@@ vity also grow@@ s from the bro@@ k@@ en places ."
"The best way to learn about anything is through stories , and so I want to tell you a story about work and play and about four aspe@@ cts of life that we need to em@@ brac@@ e in order for our own cre@@ ati@@ vity to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh ."
"The first em@@ brac@@ e is something that we think , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is very e@@ asy , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s actually getting har@@ der , and that &apos;s pa@@ ying at@@ ten@@ tion to the world around us ."
"So many arti@@ sts speak about ne@@ e@@ ding to be open , to em@@ brac@@ e experience , and that &apos;s hard to do when you have a li@@ gh@@ ted re@@ ct@@ ang@@ le in your po@@ ck@@ et that takes all of your fo@@ cus ."
"The fil@@ m@@ mak@@ er M@@ ir@@ a Na@@ ir spe@@ ak@@ s about grow@@ ing up in a small tow@@ n in Indi@@ a . I@@ ts name is B@@ hu@@ ban@@ es@@ war , and here &apos;s a picture of one of the tem@@ ples in her tow@@ n ."
"M@@ ir@@ a Na@@ ir : In this little tow@@ n , there were like 2@@ ,000 tem@@ ples ."
"We pla@@ yed cri@@ ck@@ et all the time . We kind of gre@@ w up in the ru@@ b@@ ble . The major thing that inspi@@ red me , that led me on this pat@@ h , that made me a fil@@ m@@ mak@@ er ev@@ en@@ tually , was tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing fol@@ k the@@ ater that would come through the tow@@ n and I would go off and see these great bat@@ t@@ les of good and evi@@ l by two people in a school fie@@ ld with no pro@@ ps but with a lot of , you know , pas@@ sion , and ha@@ sh@@ is@@ h as well , and it was amazing ."
"You know , the fol@@ k tal@@ es of Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ har@@ ata and R@@ am@@ a@@ y@@ ana , the two ho@@ ly boo@@ ks , the epi@@ cs that everything comes out of in Indi@@ a , they say . Af@@ ter seeing that J@@ at@@ ra , the fol@@ k the@@ ater , I knew I wanted to get on , you know , and per@@ form ."
J@@ ul@@ ie Bu@@ r@@ ste@@ in : I@@ sn &apos;t that a wonderful story ?
You can see the sort of bre@@ ak in the every@@ day .
"There they are in the school fie@@ l@@ ds , but it &apos;s good and evi@@ l , and pas@@ sion and ha@@ sh@@ is@@ h . And M@@ ir@@ a Na@@ ir was a young girl with thousands of other people wat@@ ching this perform@@ ance , but she was ready . She was ready to open up to what it sp@@ ar@@ ked in her , and it led her , as she said , down this pat@@ h to become an aw@@ ar@@ d-@@ win@@ ning fil@@ m@@ mak@@ er ."
So being open for that experience that might change you is the first thing we need to em@@ brac@@ e .
Ar@@ ti@@ sts also speak about how some of their most powerful work comes out of the par@@ ts of life that are most difficult .
The no@@ ve@@ li@@ st Ri@@ ch@@ ard F@@ or@@ d spe@@ ak@@ s about a chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od challen@@ ge that contin@@ u@@ es to be something he w@@ re@@ st@@ les with today . He &apos;s se@@ ver@@ ely dy@@ sle@@ x@@ ic .
"R@@ i@@ ch@@ ard F@@ or@@ d : I was s@@ low to learn to read , went all the way through school not really re@@ ading more than the min@@ i@@ mu@@ m , and still to this day can &apos;t read sil@@ ently much f@@ ast@@ er than I can read al@@ ou@@ d , but there were a lot of b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts to being dy@@ sle@@ x@@ ic for me because when I finally did re@@ con@@ ci@@ le myself to how s@@ low I was going to have to do it , then I think I came very s@@ low@@ ly into an ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of all of those qu@@ ali@@ ties of language and of s@@ ent@@ ences that are not just the cogni@@ tive aspe@@ cts of language : the syn@@ cop@@ ations , the sounds of words ,"
"@@ what words look like , where par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s bre@@ ak , where lin@@ es bre@@ ak . I mean , I wasn &apos;t so bad@@ ly dy@@ sle@@ x@@ ic that I was dis@@ ab@@ led from re@@ ading . I just had to do it really s@@ low@@ ly , and as I did , lin@@ g@@ ering on those s@@ ent@@ ences as I had to lin@@ ger , I fe@@ ll he@@ ir to language &apos;s other qu@@ ali@@ ties , which I think has hel@@ ped me write s@@ ent@@ ences ."
"J@@ B : It &apos;s so powerful . Ri@@ ch@@ ard F@@ or@@ d , who &apos;s won the P@@ u@@ lit@@ z@@ er P@@ ri@@ ze , says that dy@@ sle@@ x@@ ia hel@@ ped him write s@@ ent@@ ences ."
"He had to em@@ brac@@ e this challen@@ ge , and I use that word inten@@ tion@@ ally . He didn &apos;t have to over@@ come dy@@ sle@@ x@@ ia ."
He had to learn from it . He had to learn to hear the music in language .
"A@@ r@@ ti@@ sts also speak about how p@@ us@@ h@@ ing up against the li@@ mi@@ ts of what they can do , sometimes p@@ us@@ h@@ ing into what they can &apos;t do , hel@@ ps them fo@@ cus on fin@@ ding their own vo@@ ice ."
"The s@@ cul@@ p@@ tor Ri@@ ch@@ ard S@@ er@@ ra tal@@ ks about how , as a young arti@@ st , he thought he was a pain@@ ter , and he li@@ ved in F@@ l@@ or@@ ence after gra@@ du@@ ate school ."
"W@@ hi@@ le he was there , he tra@@ ve@@ led to M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d , where he went to the P@@ ra@@ do to see this picture by the S@@ p@@ ani@@ sh pain@@ ter D@@ iego V@@ el@@ á@@ z@@ qu@@ e@@ z ."
"It &apos;s from 1@@ 6@@ 5@@ 6 , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; L@@ as M@@ en@@ in@@ as , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s the picture of a little prin@@ cess and her l@@ ad@@ ie@@ s@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ wai@@ ting , and if you look over that little b@@ lon@@ de prin@@ cess &apos;s sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , you &apos;ll see a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and ref@@ le@@ cted in it are her parents , the K@@ ing and Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of S@@ pa@@ in , who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture ."
"As he often did , V@@ el@@ á@@ z@@ qu@@ e@@ z put hi@@ m@@ self in this pain@@ ting too ."
He &apos;s standing on the left with his pain@@ t@@ br@@ us@@ h in one hand and his p@@ ale@@ t@@ te in the other .
"R@@ i@@ ch@@ ard S@@ er@@ ra : I was standing there looking at it , and I realized that V@@ el@@ á@@ z@@ qu@@ e@@ z was looking at me , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh . I &apos;m the sub@@ je@@ ct of the pain@@ ting . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to do that pain@@ ting . &quot; &quot; I was to the point where I was using a stop@@ wat@@ ch and pain@@ ting squ@@ ar@@ es out of ran@@ dom@@ ness , and I wasn &apos;t getting any@@ where . So I went back and du@@ m@@ ped all my pain@@ t@@ ings in the Ar@@ no , and I thought , I &apos;m going to just start playing around ."
"J@@ B : Ri@@ ch@@ ard S@@ er@@ ra says that so n@@ on@@ chal@@ an@@ tly , you might have mis@@ sed it . He went and saw this pain@@ ting by a guy who &apos;d been de@@ ad for 3@@ 00 years , and realized , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t do that , &quot; &quot; and so Ri@@ ch@@ ard S@@ er@@ ra went back to his studi@@ o in F@@ l@@ or@@ ence , pi@@ cked up all of his work up to that point , and thre@@ w it in a ri@@ ver ."
"R@@ i@@ ch@@ ard S@@ er@@ ra let go of pain@@ ting at that moment , but he didn &apos;t let go of art . He mo@@ ved to New York C@@ ity , and he put together a li@@ st of ver@@ b@@ s — to ro@@ ll , to cre@@ ase , to f@@ old — more than a hundre@@ d of them , and as he said , he just started playing around . He did these things to all kinds of materi@@ al . He would take a huge sh@@ e@@ et of le@@ ad and ro@@ ll it up and un@@ ro@@ ll it . He would do the same thing to ru@@ b@@ ber , and when he got to the dire@@ ction &quot; &quot; to li@@ ft , &quot; &quot; he created this , which is in the M@@ us@@ e@@ um of M@@ od@@ er@@ n Ar@@ t ."
"R@@ i@@ ch@@ ard S@@ er@@ ra had to let go of pain@@ ting in order to em@@ bar@@ k on this pla@@ y@@ ful expl@@ or@@ ation that led him to the work that he &apos;s known for today : huge cur@@ ves of ste@@ el that requi@@ re our time and moti@@ on to experience . In s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture , Ri@@ ch@@ ard S@@ er@@ ra is able to do what he couldn &apos;t do in pain@@ ting ."
He makes us the sub@@ je@@ ct of his art .
So experience and challen@@ ge and li@@ mi@@ t@@ ations are all things we need to em@@ brac@@ e for cre@@ ati@@ vity to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh .
"There &apos;s a f@@ our@@ th em@@ brac@@ e , and it &apos;s the har@@ d@@ est ."
"It &apos;s the em@@ brac@@ e of lo@@ ss , the ol@@ d@@ est and most con@@ st@@ ant of human exper@@ ien@@ ces ."
"In order to create , we have to stand in that space between what we see in the world and what we hope for , looking squ@@ are@@ ly at re@@ je@@ ction , at hear@@ t@@ bre@@ ak , at war , at death ."
That &apos;s a t@@ ough space to stand in .
"The edu@@ cat@@ or Par@@ k@@ er P@@ al@@ m@@ er cal@@ ls it &quot; &quot; the tra@@ gi@@ c ga@@ p , &quot; &quot; tra@@ gi@@ c not because it &apos;s sa@@ d but because it &apos;s in@@ evi@@ table , and my friend D@@ i@@ ck N@@ o@@ de@@ l li@@ k@@ es to say , &quot; &quot; You can h@@ old that ten@@ sion like a vi@@ o@@ li@@ n str@@ ing and make something beautiful . &quot; &quot; That ten@@ sion re@@ son@@ ates in the work of the photograph@@ er Jo@@ el M@@ ey@@ er@@ owi@@ t@@ z , who at the beginning of his car@@ e@@ er was known for his stre@@ et photograph@@ y , for cap@@ tur@@ ing a moment on the stre@@ et , and also for his beautiful photograph@@ s of land@@ s@@ cap@@ es — of T@@ us@@ c@@ any , of C@@ ap@@ e C@@ od , of light ."
"J@@ o@@ el is a New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er , and his studi@@ o for many years was in Ch@@ el@@ se@@ a , with a stra@@ ight view dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n to the World T@@ ra@@ de C@@ enter , and he photograph@@ ed those buil@@ dings in every sort of light ."
You know where this story goes .
"O@@ n 9 / 11 , Jo@@ el wasn &apos;t in New York . He was out of tow@@ n , but he rac@@ ed back to the city , and rac@@ ed down to the site of the de@@ stru@@ ction ."
"J@@ o@@ el M@@ ey@@ er@@ owi@@ t@@ z : And like all the other pas@@ ser@@ s@@ by , I sto@@ od outside the cha@@ in lin@@ k f@@ ence on C@@ ha@@ m@@ bers and Gre@@ en@@ wi@@ ch , and all I could see was the smo@@ ke and a little bit of ru@@ b@@ ble , and I ra@@ is@@ ed my cam@@ era to take a pe@@ ek , just to see if there was something to see , and some co@@ p , a l@@ ady co@@ p , h@@ it me on my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , no pi@@ ctures ! &quot; &quot; And it was such a b@@ low that it wo@@ ke me up , in the way that it was me@@ ant to be , I gu@@ ess ."
"And when I asked her why no pi@@ ctures , she said , &quot; It &apos;s a cri@@ me scen@@ e . No photograph@@ s allow@@ ed . &quot;"
"And I asked her , &quot; &quot; What would happen if I was a member of the pre@@ ss ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , &quot; &quot; Oh , look back there , &quot; &quot; and back a blo@@ ck was the pre@@ ss cor@@ ps t@@ ied up in a little pen@@ ne@@ d-@@ in area , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , when do they go in ? &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; P@@ rob@@ ably never . &quot; &quot; And as I wal@@ ked away from that , I had this c@@ r@@ yst@@ al@@ liz@@ ation , probably from the b@@ low , because it was an in@@ sul@@ t in a way ."
"I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , if there &apos;s no pi@@ ctures , then there &apos;ll be no recor@@ d . We need a recor@@ d . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m g@@ on@@ na make that recor@@ d ."
"I &apos;ll find a way to get in , because I don &apos;t want to see this history disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar . &quot; &quot; J@@ B : He did . He pul@@ led in every fa@@ v@@ or he could , and got a pas@@ s into the World T@@ ra@@ de C@@ enter site , where he photograph@@ ed for n@@ ine months almost every day ."
L@@ o@@ o@@ king at these photograph@@ s today br@@ ings back the s@@ me@@ ll of smo@@ ke that lin@@ ger@@ ed on my clo@@ the@@ s when I went home to my family at night .
My offi@@ ce was just a few blo@@ cks away .
"But some of these photograph@@ s are beautiful , and we wonder@@ ed , was it difficult for Jo@@ el M@@ ey@@ er@@ owi@@ t@@ z to make such beau@@ ty out of such de@@ v@@ ast@@ ation ?"
"J@@ M : Well , you know , u@@ g@@ ly , I mean , powerful and tra@@ gi@@ c and hor@@ ri@@ fic and everything , but it was also as , in nature , an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous ev@@ ent that was trans@@ form@@ ed after the fact into this resi@@ du@@ e , and like many other ru@@ ins — you go to the ru@@ ins of the Co@@ lo@@ s@@ se@@ um or the ru@@ ins of a ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral some@@ place — and they take on a new me@@ an@@ ing when you wat@@ ch the we@@ a@@ ther ."
"I mean , there were af@@ ter@@ no@@ ons I was down there , and the light goes p@@ in@@ k and there &apos;s a mi@@ st in the air and you &apos;re standing in the ru@@ b@@ ble , and I found myself re@@ cogni@@ z@@ ing both the in@@ her@@ ent beau@@ ty of nature and the fact that nature , as time , is er@@ as@@ ing this w@@ ound ."
"T@@ i@@ me is un@@ stop@@ p@@ able , and it trans@@ form@@ s the ev@@ ent ."
"It gets f@@ ur@@ ther and f@@ ur@@ ther away from the day , and light and se@@ as@@ ons tem@@ per it in some way , and it &apos;s not that I &apos;m a ro@@ man@@ tic . I &apos;m really a reali@@ st ."
"The re@@ ality is , there &apos;s the W@@ o@@ ol@@ wor@@ th Bu@@ il@@ ding in a ve@@ il of smo@@ ke from the site , but it &apos;s now like a sc@@ ri@@ m across a the@@ ater , and it &apos;s tur@@ ning p@@ in@@ k , you know , and down be@@ low there are h@@ os@@ es spra@@ ying , and the li@@ ghts have come on for the ev@@ ening , and the water is tur@@ ning ac@@ id green because the s@@ od@@ i@@ um l@@ am@@ ps are on , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; My God , who could dre@@ am this up ? &quot; &quot; But the fact is , I &apos;m there , it looks like that , you have to take a picture ."
"J@@ B : You have to take a picture . That sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , of the need to get to work , is so powerful in Jo@@ el &apos;s story ."
"When I saw Jo@@ el M@@ ey@@ er@@ owi@@ t@@ z re@@ cent@@ ly , I told him how much I ad@@ mi@@ red his pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate ob@@ st@@ in@@ acy , his de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation to p@@ us@@ h through all the bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ r@@ atic red ta@@ pe to get to work , and he l@@ augh@@ ed , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m stu@@ b@@ born , but I think what &apos;s more important is my pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m . &quot; &quot; The first time I told these stories , a man in the audience ra@@ is@@ ed his hand and said , &quot; &quot; All these arti@@ sts talk about their work , not their art , which has got me thinking about my work and where the cre@@ ati@@ vity is there , and I &apos;m not an arti@@ st . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s right . We all w@@ re@@ st@@ le with experience and challen@@ ge , li@@ mi@@ ts and lo@@ ss ."
"C@@ re@@ ati@@ vity is essen@@ tial to all of us , whether we &apos;re scienti@@ sts or teach@@ ers , parents or ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s ."
"I want to leave you with another image of a J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese te@@ a bow@@ l . This one is at the F@@ re@@ er G@@ al@@ l@@ ery in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ ."
It &apos;s more than a hundre@@ d years old and you can still see the fin@@ ger@@ mar@@ ks where the pot@@ ter p@@ in@@ ched it .
"But as you can also see , this one did bre@@ ak at some point in its hundre@@ d years ."
"But the person who put it back together , instead of hi@@ ding the c@@ rac@@ ks , decided to em@@ p@@ ha@@ size them , using g@@ old l@@ ac@@ qu@@ er to re@@ pa@@ ir it ."
"This bow@@ l is more beautiful now , having been bro@@ k@@ en , than it was when it was first made , and we can look at those c@@ rac@@ ks , because they tell the story that we all live , of the cy@@ cle of cre@@ ation and de@@ stru@@ ction , of control and le@@ tting go , of pi@@ c@@ king up the pie@@ ces and making something new ."

"L@@ ast year here at TED I asked you to give me your data , to put your data on the we@@ b , on the basi@@ s that if people put data on@@ to the we@@ b — government data , scienti@@ fic data , community data , whatever it is — it will be used by other people to do wonderful things , in ways that they never could have imag@@ ined ."
"So , today I &apos;m back just to show you a few things , to show you , in fact , there is an open data movement a@@ fo@@ ot , now , around the world ."
"The c@@ ry of &quot; &quot; R@@ a@@ w data now ! &quot; &quot; which I made people make in the au@@ di@@ t@@ ori@@ um , was heard around the world ."
"So , let &apos;s ro@@ ll the video ."
"A clas@@ si@@ c story , the first one which lots of people pi@@ cked up , was when in Mar@@ ch — on Mar@@ ch 10@@ th in fact , so@@ on after TED — P@@ au@@ l C@@ lar@@ ke , in the U.@@ K@@ . government , blo@@ gg@@ ed , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve just got some ra@@ w data . Here it is , it &apos;s about bi@@ cy@@ cle ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents . &quot; &quot; T@@ wo days it took the T@@ im@@ es O@@ n@@ line to make a ma@@ p , a mas@@ ha@@ ble ma@@ p — we call these things mas@@ h@@ -@@ u@@ ps — a mas@@ he@@ d-@@ up us@@ er inter@@ face that allow@@ s you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bi@@ cy@@ cle rou@@ te to work was af@@ fe@@ cted ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s more data , traf@@ fic sur@@ v@@ ey data , again , put out by the U.@@ K@@ . government , and because they put it up using the L@@ in@@ ked D@@ ata stan@@ dar@@ ds , then a us@@ er could just make a ma@@ p , just by c@@ lic@@ king ."
"D@@ o@@ es this data af@@ fe@@ ct things ? Well , let &apos;s get back to 200@@ 8 ."
"L@@ ook at Z@@ an@@ es@@ vi@@ l@@ le , O@@ hi@@ o ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s a ma@@ p a la@@ wy@@ er made . He put on it the water pl@@ ant , and which h@@ ous@@ es are there , which h@@ ous@@ es have been conne@@ cted to the water ."
"And he got , from other data sources , information to show which h@@ ous@@ es are oc@@ cu@@ pie@@ d by white people ."
"Well , there was too much of a cor@@ rel@@ ation , he felt , between which h@@ ous@@ es were oc@@ cu@@ pie@@ d by white people and which h@@ ous@@ es had water , and the ju@@ dge was not im@@ pres@@ sed either ."
The ju@@ dge was not im@@ pres@@ sed to the tu@@ ne of 10@@ .@@ 9 million dollars .
"That &apos;s the power of taking one piece of data , another piece of data , pu@@ tting it together , and show@@ ing the resul@@ t ."
Let &apos;s look at some data from the U.@@ K@@ . now .
"This is U.@@ K@@ . government data , a completely in@@ depen@@ dent site , W@@ here D@@ o@@ es My M@@ on@@ ey G@@ o ."
It allow@@ s any@@ body to go there and bur@@ row down .
"You can bur@@ row down by a particular ty@@ pe of sp@@ ending , or you can go through all the different regi@@ ons and comp@@ are them ."
"So , that &apos;s happening in the U.@@ K@@ . with U.@@ K@@ . government data ."
"@@ Yes , cer@@ tain@@ ly you can do it over here ."
Here &apos;s a site which allow@@ s you to look at re@@ co@@ very sp@@ ending in C@@ alifor@@ nia .
"T@@ ake an ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary example , L@@ ong Be@@ ach , C@@ alifor@@ nia , you can go and have a look at what re@@ co@@ very money they &apos;ve been sp@@ ending on different things such as energy ."
"In fact , this is the gra@@ ph of the number of data se@@ ts in the re@@ pos@@ it@@ or@@ ies of d@@ at@@ a@@ .@@ go@@ v , and d@@ at@@ a@@ .@@ go@@ v@@ .@@ u@@ k@@ ."
"And I &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to see a great compe@@ ti@@ tion between the U.@@ K@@ . in blue , and the U.@@ S. in red ."
How can you use this stuff ?
"Well , for example , if you have lots of data about places you can take , from a post@@ c@@ od@@ e — which is like a zi@@ p p@@ lu@@ s four — for a speci@@ fic group of h@@ ous@@ es , you can make pa@@ per , pr@@ int off a pa@@ per which has got very , very speci@@ fic things about the bu@@ s stop@@ s , the things speci@@ fi@@ cally ne@@ ar you ."
"O@@ n a lar@@ ger scale , this is a mas@@ h@@ -@@ up of the data which was rele@@ as@@ ed about the Af@@ gh@@ an ele@@ ctions ."
It allow@@ s you to set your own cri@@ ter@@ ia for what sort of things you want to look at .
"The red cir@@ cles are pol@@ ling st@@ ations , se@@ le@@ cted by your cri@@ ter@@ ia ."
"And then you can se@@ le@@ ct also other things on the ma@@ p to see what other fac@@ t@@ ors , like the thre@@ at level ."
"So , that was government data ."
I also tal@@ ked about communi@@ ty@@ -@@ gener@@ ated data — in fact I e@@ di@@ ted some .
"This is the wi@@ ki ma@@ p , this is the O@@ p@@ en St@@ re@@ et Ma@@ p ."
&quot; &quot; T@@ er@@ rac@@ e Th@@ e@@ ater &quot; &quot; I actually put on the ma@@ p because it wasn &apos;t on the ma@@ p before TED last year .
I was not the only person e@@ di@@ ting the open stre@@ et ma@@ p .
E@@ ach f@@ las@@ h on this vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ ation — put together by I@@ T@@ O World — shows an ed@@ it in 200@@ 9 made to the O@@ p@@ en St@@ re@@ et Ma@@ p .
Let &apos;s now sp@@ in the world during the same year .
"E@@ very f@@ las@@ h is an ed@@ it . S@@ ome@@ body some@@ where looking at the O@@ p@@ en St@@ re@@ et Ma@@ p , and realiz@@ ing it could be better ."
You can see Europ@@ e is ab@@ la@@ ze with up@@ d@@ ates .
"S@@ ome places , per@@ haps not as much as they should be ."
Here fo@@ c@@ using in on Ha@@ it@@ i .
"The ma@@ p of P@@ or@@ t au@@ -@@ P@@ r@@ in@@ ce at the end of 200@@ 9 was not all it could be , not as good as the ma@@ p of C@@ alifor@@ nia ."
"F@@ or@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , just after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , G@@ e@@ o@@ E@@ y@@ e , a comm@@ er@@ cial company , rele@@ as@@ ed s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te imag@@ ery with a li@@ cen@@ se , which allow@@ ed the open@@ -@@ source community to use it ."
"This is J@@ an@@ u@@ ary , in time lap@@ se , of people e@@ di@@ ting ... that &apos;s the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"A@@ f@@ ter the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , im@@ medi@@ ately , people all over the world , ma@@ p@@ per@@ s who wanted to help , and could , looked at that imag@@ ery , built the ma@@ p , quickly building it up ."
We &apos;re fo@@ c@@ using now on P@@ or@@ t-@@ au@@ -@@ P@@ r@@ in@@ ce .
The light blue is re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps these vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers had spo@@ t@@ ted from the &#91; s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te images &#93; .
"So , now we have , im@@ medi@@ ately , a re@@ al@@ -@@ time ma@@ p show@@ ing where there are re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps — ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly became the best ma@@ p to use if you &apos;re doing re@@ lie@@ f work in P@@ or@@ t-@@ au@@ -@@ P@@ r@@ in@@ ce ."
W@@ it@@ ness the fact that it &apos;s here on this G@@ ar@@ m@@ in de@@ vice being used by re@@ s@@ cu@@ e team in Ha@@ it@@ i .
"There &apos;s the ma@@ p show@@ ing , on the le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side , that ho@@ spit@@ al — actually that &apos;s a ho@@ spit@@ al ship ."
"This is a re@@ al@@ -@@ time ma@@ p that shows blo@@ cked ro@@ ads , dam@@ aged buil@@ dings , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps — it shows things that are needed &#91; for re@@ s@@ cu@@ e and re@@ lie@@ f work &#93; ."
"So , if you &apos;ve been inv@@ olved in that at all , I just wanted to say : Wh@@ atever you &apos;ve been doing , whether you &apos;ve just been ch@@ an@@ ting , &quot; &quot; R@@ a@@ w data now ! &quot; &quot; or you &apos;ve been pu@@ tting government or scienti@@ fic data on@@ line , I just wanted to take this opportunity to say : Thank you very much , and we have only just started !"
( Applause )
"I &apos;m an e@@ co@@ logi@@ st , mo@@ st@@ ly a cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f e@@ co@@ logi@@ st ."
I started out in Ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ ake B@@ ay and went di@@ ving in the win@@ ter and became a tro@@ pi@@ cal e@@ co@@ logi@@ st over@@ night .
And it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years .
"I mean , somebody pa@@ ys you to go around and tra@@ vel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet ."
And that was what I did .
"And I en@@ ded up in J@@ am@@ a@@ i@@ ca , in the W@@ est In@@ d@@ ies , where the cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s were really am@@ ong the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary , stru@@ c@@ tur@@ ally , that I ever saw in my life ."
"And this picture here , it &apos;s really interesting , it shows two things : F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far , and film was so s@@ low in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s and early 7@@ 0s , you took pi@@ ctures in black and white ."
"The other thing it shows you is that , al@@ though there &apos;s this beautiful fore@@ st of cor@@ al , there are no fish in that picture ."
"Th@@ ose re@@ ef@@ s at D@@ is@@ co@@ very B@@ ay , J@@ am@@ a@@ i@@ ca were the most stud@@ ied cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s in the world for 20 years ."
We were the best and the bri@@ gh@@ test .
"P@@ e@@ ople came to study our re@@ ef@@ s from Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , which is sort of fun@@ ny because now we go to the@@ ir@@ s ."
"And the view of scienti@@ sts about how cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s work , how they ou@@ ght to be , was based on these re@@ ef@@ s without any fish ."
"Th@@ en , in 19@@ 80 , there was a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ c@@ ane , H@@ ur@@ ri@@ c@@ ane Al@@ le@@ n ."
I put half the la@@ b up in my house .
The wind b@@ le@@ w very stron@@ g .
The wa@@ ves were 25 to 50 fe@@ et high .
"And the re@@ ef@@ s disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ared , and new is@@ l@@ ands form@@ ed , and we thought , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re real s@@ mar@@ t ."
"We know that h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ es have always happened in the past . &quot; &quot; And we publi@@ shed a pa@@ per in S@@ cien@@ ce , the first time that any@@ body ever descri@@ bed the de@@ stru@@ ction on a cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f by a major h@@ ur@@ ri@@ c@@ ane ."
"And we pre@@ di@@ cted what would happen , and we got it all wrong ."
"And the reason was because of over@@ fi@@ sh@@ ing , and the fact that a last common gra@@ z@@ er , a se@@ a ur@@ ch@@ in , d@@ ied ."
"And within a few months after that se@@ a ur@@ ch@@ in dy@@ ing , the se@@ a@@ we@@ ed started to gro@@ w ."
And that is the same re@@ e@@ f ; that &apos;s the same re@@ e@@ f 15 years ago ; that &apos;s the same re@@ e@@ f today .
The cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s of the nor@@ th co@@ ast of J@@ am@@ a@@ i@@ ca have a few percent live cor@@ al co@@ ver and a lot of se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and sli@@ me .
"And that &apos;s more or less the story of the cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s of the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , and incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly , tra@@ gi@@ cally , the cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
"Now , that &apos;s my little , de@@ pres@@ sing story ."
All of us in our 6@@ 0s and 7@@ 0s have com@@ par@@ able de@@ pres@@ sing stories .
"There are ten@@ s of thousands of those stories out there , and it &apos;s really hard to con@@ ju@@ re up much of a sense of wel@@ l-@@ being , because it just ke@@ e@@ ps getting wor@@ se ."
"And the reason it ke@@ e@@ ps getting wor@@ se is that after a natural cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ he , like a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ c@@ ane , it used to be that there was some kind of suc@@ ces@@ si@@ onal sequ@@ ence of re@@ co@@ very , but what &apos;s going on now is that over@@ fi@@ sh@@ ing and pol@@ lu@@ tion and clim@@ ate change are all inter@@ ac@@ ting in a way that pre@@ v@@ ents that ."
And so I &apos;m going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things .
We hear a lot about the col@@ lap@@ se of c@@ od .
"It &apos;s difficult to imagine that two , or some histori@@ ans would say three world war@@ s were f@@ ou@@ ght during the col@@ oni@@ al era for the control of c@@ od ."
C@@ od f@@ ed most of the people of W@@ est@@ er@@ n Europ@@ e .
"It f@@ ed the s@@ la@@ ves brought to the An@@ ti@@ l@@ les , the s@@ ong &quot; &quot; J@@ am@@ a@@ i@@ ca F@@ are@@ well &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; A@@ c@@ ke@@ e ri@@ ce s@@ al@@ t fish are nice &quot; &quot; — is an em@@ b@@ lem of the import@@ ance of s@@ al@@ t c@@ od from nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n C@@ an@@ ada ."
"It all col@@ lap@@ sed in the 8@@ 0s and the 9@@ 0s : 3@@ 5@@ ,000 people lost their j@@ ob@@ s ."
"And that was the beginning of a kind of seri@@ al de@@ ple@@ tion from bi@@ g@@ ger and ta@@ st@@ ier species to s@@ mal@@ ler and not@@ -@@ so@@ -@@ ta@@ sty species , from species that were ne@@ ar to home to species that were all around the world , and what have you ."
"It &apos;s a little hard to understand that , because you can go to a C@@ ost@@ co in the United States and bu@@ y che@@ a@@ p fish ."
"You ou@@ ght to read the la@@ be@@ l to find out where it came from , but it &apos;s still che@@ a@@ p , and everybody thin@@ ks it &apos;s o@@ kay ."
"It &apos;s hard to communi@@ cate this , and one way that I think is really interesting is to talk about spor@@ t fish , because people like to go out and cat@@ ch fish ."
It &apos;s one of those things .
"This picture here shows the tro@@ ph@@ y fish , the bi@@ ggest fish ca@@ u@@ ght by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat , go to a place off of K@@ ey W@@ est in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , d@@ r@@ in@@ k a lot of be@@ er , th@@ row a lot of ho@@ o@@ ks and lin@@ es into the water , come back with the bi@@ ggest and the best fish , and the ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on tro@@ ph@@ y fish are put on this bo@@ ard , where people take a picture , and this guy is obvi@@ ously really exci@@ ted about that fish ."
"Well , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like now , but this is what it was like in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s from the same boat in the same place on the same bo@@ ard on the same do@@ ck ."
The tro@@ ph@@ y fish were so big that you couldn &apos;t put any of those small fish up on it .
"And the a@@ ver@@ age size tro@@ ph@@ y fish we@@ igh@@ ed 2@@ 50 to 3@@ 00 po@@ un@@ ds , go@@ li@@ ath grou@@ per , and if you wanted to go out and ki@@ ll something , you could pretty much coun@@ t on being able to cat@@ ch one of those fish ."
And they ta@@ st@@ ed really good .
"And people pa@@ id less in 19@@ 50 dollars to cat@@ ch that than what people pay now to cat@@ ch those little , t@@ iny fish ."
And that &apos;s every@@ where .
"It &apos;s not just the fish , though , that are disa@@ p@@ pe@@ aring ."
"In@@ du@@ stri@@ al fi@@ sh@@ ing uses big stuff , big mach@@ in@@ ery ."
We use ne@@ ts that are 20 miles long .
We use lon@@ gl@@ ines that have one million or two million ho@@ o@@ ks .
"And we t@@ raw@@ l , which means to take something the size of a trac@@ tor tra@@ i@@ ler tru@@ ck that we@@ igh@@ s thousands and thousands of po@@ un@@ ds , put it on a big cha@@ in , and dra@@ g it across the se@@ a flo@@ or to st@@ ir up the bot@@ tom and cat@@ ch the fish ."
"Th@@ in@@ k of it as being kind of the bu@@ ll@@ do@@ z@@ ing of a city or of a fore@@ st , because it c@@ lear@@ s it away ."
And the ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at de@@ stru@@ ction is un@@ belie@@ v@@ able .
"This is a photogra@@ ph , a ty@@ pi@@ cal photogra@@ ph , of what the contin@@ ent@@ al sh@@ el@@ ves of the world look like ."
"You can see the row@@ s in the bot@@ tom , the way you can see the row@@ s in a fie@@ ld that has just been pl@@ ow@@ ed to pl@@ ant cor@@ n ."
"What that was , was a fore@@ st of spon@@ ges and cor@@ al , which is a cri@@ tical ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at for the develo@@ pment of fish ."
"What it is now is mu@@ d , and the area of the ocean flo@@ or that has been trans@@ form@@ ed from fore@@ st to level mu@@ d , to par@@ king lot , is e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent to the entire area of all the fore@@ sts that have ever been cut down on all of the ear@@ th in the history of hum@@ ani@@ ty ."
We &apos;ve man@@ aged to do that in the last 100 to 1@@ 50 years .
We ten@@ d to think of oil sp@@ il@@ ls and mer@@ cu@@ ry and we hear a lot about pla@@ stic these days .
"And all of that stuff is really dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing , but what &apos;s really in@@ si@@ di@@ ous is the biologi@@ cal pol@@ lu@@ tion that happens because of the mag@@ ni@@ tu@@ de of the shi@@ f@@ ts that it ca@@ uses to entire e@@ co@@ systems ."
And I &apos;m going to just talk very br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly about two kinds of biologi@@ cal pol@@ lu@@ tion : one is in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced species and the other is what comes from nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ ts .
"So this is the in@@ fam@@ ous C@@ au@@ l@@ er@@ p@@ a ta@@ x@@ i@@ fo@@ li@@ a , the so@@ -@@ called kil@@ ler al@@ ga@@ e ."
A book was wri@@ t@@ ten about it .
It &apos;s a bit of an em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ ment .
"It was ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally rele@@ as@@ ed from the a@@ qu@@ ari@@ um in M@@ on@@ ac@@ o , it was b@@ red to be c@@ old t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant to have in pe@@ op@@ les a@@ qu@@ ar@@ ia ."
"It &apos;s very pretty , and it has ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly started to over@@ gro@@ w the once very ri@@ ch bi@@ od@@ i@@ versity of the nor@@ th@@ we@@ ster@@ n Me@@ di@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an ."
"I don &apos;t know how many of you remember the movie &quot; The L@@ it@@ tle S@@ ho@@ p of H@@ or@@ ro@@ r@@ s , &quot; but this is the pl@@ ant of &quot; &quot; The L@@ it@@ tle S@@ ho@@ p of H@@ or@@ ro@@ r@@ s . &quot; &quot; But , instead of de@@ v@@ our@@ ing the people in the sho@@ p , what it &apos;s doing is over@@ grow@@ ing and smo@@ ther@@ ing vi@@ r@@ tually all of the bot@@ tom@@ -@@ dw@@ el@@ ling life of the entire nor@@ th@@ we@@ ster@@ n Me@@ di@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an Se@@ a ."
"We don &apos;t know anything that e@@ ats it , we &apos;re trying to do all sor@@ ts of gen@@ e@@ ti@@ cs and figure out something that could be done , but , as it stan@@ ds , it &apos;s the mon@@ ster from he@@ ll , about which no@@ body know@@ s what to do ."
Now another form of pol@@ lu@@ tion that &apos;s biologi@@ cal pol@@ lu@@ tion is what happens from ex@@ cess nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ ts .
"The green re@@ v@@ olution , all of this arti@@ fi@@ cial ni@@ tro@@ g@@ en fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er , we use too much of it ."
"It &apos;s sub@@ si@@ di@@ zed , which is one of the reas@@ ons we used too much of it ."
"It ru@@ ns down the ri@@ ver@@ s , and it fe@@ eds the plan@@ kt@@ on , the little micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic pl@@ ant cells in the co@@ ast@@ al water ."
"But since we ate all the o@@ yst@@ ers and we ate all the fish that would e@@ at the plan@@ kt@@ on , there &apos;s nothing to e@@ at the plan@@ kt@@ on and there &apos;s more and more of it , so it d@@ ies of old age , which is un@@ heard of for plan@@ kt@@ on ."
"And when it d@@ ies , it fal@@ ls to the bot@@ tom and then it ro@@ ts , which means that bac@@ ter@@ ia bre@@ ak it down ."
"And in the process they use up all the o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en , and in using up all the o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en they make the environment ut@@ ter@@ ly le@@ th@@ al for anything that can &apos;t s@@ wi@@ m away ."
"So , what we end up with is a mi@@ c@@ robi@@ al z@@ o@@ o dom@@ in@@ ated by bac@@ ter@@ ia and je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish , as you see on the left in front of you ."
"And the only fi@@ sh@@ ery left — and it is a comm@@ er@@ cial fi@@ sh@@ ery — is the je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish fi@@ sh@@ ery you see on the right , where there used to be praw@@ ns ."
"E@@ ven in N@@ ew@@ f@@ oun@@ d@@ land where we used to cat@@ ch c@@ od , we now have a je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish fi@@ sh@@ ery ."
And another ver@@ sion of this sort of thing is what is often called red ti@@ des or to@@ x@@ ic blo@@ oms .
That picture on the left is just st@@ ag@@ g@@ ering to me .
"I have tal@@ ked about it a million times , but it &apos;s un@@ belie@@ v@@ able ."
"In the u@@ pp@@ er right of that picture on the left is almost the M@@ is@@ si@@ s@@ si@@ pp@@ i D@@ el@@ ta , and the low@@ er left of that picture is the T@@ ex@@ as@@ -@@ M@@ exi@@ co bor@@ der ."
"You &apos;re looking at the entire nor@@ th@@ we@@ ster@@ n G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ exi@@ co ; you &apos;re looking at one to@@ x@@ ic din@@ of@@ l@@ ag@@ el@@ l@@ ate blo@@ om that can ki@@ ll fish , made by that beautiful little cre@@ ature on the low@@ er right ."
And in the u@@ pp@@ er right you see this black sort of cl@@ ou@@ d moving as@@ hor@@ e .
That &apos;s the same species .
"And as it comes to sh@@ ore and the wind b@@ low@@ s , and little dro@@ ple@@ ts of the water get into the air , the em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy ro@@ oms of all the ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s fi@@ ll up with people with ac@@ u@@ te re@@ sp@@ ir@@ at@@ ory di@@ stre@@ ss ."
And that &apos;s re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment hom@@ es on the w@@ est co@@ ast of F@@ l@@ ori@@ da .
"A friend and I did this thing in H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood we called H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood ocean night , and I was trying to figure out how to expla@@ in to ac@@ t@@ ors what &apos;s going on ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; So , imagine you &apos;re in a movie called &apos; E@@ s@@ cape from M@@ ali@@ b@@ u &apos; because all the beautiful people have mo@@ ved to Nor@@ th D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a , where it &apos;s cle@@ an and sa@@ fe ."
"And the only people who are left there are the people who can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d to move away from the co@@ ast , because the co@@ ast , instead of being par@@ ad@@ ise , is har@@ m@@ ful to your health . &quot; &quot; And then this is amazing ."
It was when I was on ho@@ li@@ day last early au@@ tu@@ m@@ n in Fran@@ ce .
"This is from the co@@ ast of Bri@@ t@@ t@@ any , which is being en@@ velo@@ ped in this green , al@@ g@@ al sli@@ me ."
"The reason that it at@@ trac@@ ted so much at@@ ten@@ tion , be@@ si@@ des the fact that it &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing , is that se@@ a bir@@ ds fl@@ ying over it are as@@ ph@@ y@@ x@@ i@@ ated by the s@@ me@@ ll and die , and a farm@@ er d@@ ied of it , and you can imagine the sc@@ and@@ al that happened ."
"And so there &apos;s this war between the farm@@ ers and the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men about it all , and the net resul@@ t is that the be@@ ach@@ es of Bri@@ t@@ t@@ any have to be bu@@ ll@@ do@@ zed of this stuff on a regu@@ lar basi@@ s ."
"And then , of course , there &apos;s clim@@ ate change , and we all know about clim@@ ate change ."
I gu@@ ess the i@@ con@@ ic figure of it is the me@@ l@@ ting of the ice in the Ar@@ cti@@ c Se@@ a .
Th@@ in@@ k about the thousands and thousands of people who d@@ ied trying to find the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est P@@ as@@ s@@ age .
"Well , the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est P@@ as@@ s@@ age is already there ."
"I think it &apos;s sort of fun@@ ny ; it &apos;s on the S@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ an co@@ ast , maybe the R@@ us@@ si@@ ans will char@@ ge t@@ ol@@ ls ."
The govern@@ ments of the world are taking this really seri@@ ously .
The mi@@ lit@@ ary of the Ar@@ cti@@ c n@@ ations is taking it really seri@@ ously .
"For all the d@@ eni@@ al of clim@@ ate change by government le@@ ad@@ ers , the C@@ I@@ A and the na@@ v@@ ies of Nor@@ way and the U.@@ S. and C@@ an@@ ada , whatever are bu@@ si@@ ly thinking about how they will secu@@ re their terri@@ t@@ ory in this in@@ evi@@ t@@ ability from their point of view ."
"And , of course , Ar@@ cti@@ c communi@@ ties are to@@ ast ."
"The other kinds of effe@@ cts of clim@@ ate change — this is cor@@ al b@@ le@@ ach@@ ing . It &apos;s a beautiful picture , right ?"
All that white cor@@ al .
E@@ x@@ cept it &apos;s sup@@ posed to be b@@ row@@ n .
"What happens is that the cor@@ als are a sym@@ bio@@ sis , and they have these little al@@ g@@ al cells that live inside them ."
"And the al@@ ga@@ e give the cor@@ als su@@ g@@ ar , and the cor@@ als give the al@@ ga@@ e nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ ts and prote@@ ction ."
"But when it gets too ho@@ t , the al@@ ga@@ e can &apos;t make the su@@ g@@ ar ."
"The cor@@ als say , &quot; &quot; You che@@ ated . You didn &apos;t pay your r@@ ent . &quot; &quot; They ki@@ ck them out , and then they die ."
"N@@ ot all of them die ; some of them survi@@ ve , some more are survi@@ ving , but it &apos;s really bad news ."
"To try and give you a sense of this , imagine you go cam@@ ping in Ju@@ ly some@@ where in Europ@@ e or in Nor@@ th America , and you wa@@ ke up the next morning , and you look around you , and you see that 80 percent of the tre@@ es , as far as you can see , have dro@@ pped their lea@@ ves and are standing there na@@ ked ."
"And you come home , and you disco@@ ver that 80 percent of all the tre@@ es in Nor@@ th America and in Europ@@ e have dro@@ pped their lea@@ ves ."
"And then you read in the pa@@ per a few weeks later , &quot; Oh , by the way , a qu@@ ar@@ ter of those d@@ ied . &quot;"
"Well , that &apos;s what happened in the Indi@@ an O@@ ce@@ an during the 199@@ 8 E@@ l N@@ in@@ o , an area v@@ ast@@ ly gre@@ ater than the size of Nor@@ th America and Europ@@ e , when 80 percent of all the cor@@ als b@@ le@@ ach@@ ed and a qu@@ ar@@ ter of them d@@ ied ."
"And then the really sc@@ ary thing about all of this — the over@@ fi@@ sh@@ ing , the pol@@ lu@@ tion and the clim@@ ate change — is that each thing doesn &apos;t happen in a vac@@ u@@ um ."
"But there are these , what we call , posi@@ tive fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ ks , the sy@@ ner@@ g@@ ies am@@ ong them that make the whole v@@ ast@@ ly gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the par@@ ts ."
"And the great scienti@@ fic challen@@ ge for people like me in thinking about all this , is do we know how to put H@@ um@@ p@@ ty D@@ um@@ p@@ ty back together again ?"
"I mean , because we , at this point , we can prote@@ ct it ."
But what does that mean ?
We really don &apos;t know .
So what are the oce@@ ans going to be like in 20 or 50 years ?
"Well , there won &apos;t be any fish ex@@ cept for min@@ now@@ s , and the water will be pretty di@@ r@@ ty , and all those kinds of things and full of mer@@ cu@@ ry , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
"And de@@ ad z@@ ones will get bi@@ g@@ ger and bi@@ g@@ ger and they &apos;ll start to mer@@ ge , and we can imagine something like the de@@ ad@@ -@@ z@@ oni@@ fi@@ cation of the global , co@@ ast@@ al ocean ."
"Th@@ en you sure won &apos;t want to e@@ at fish that were ra@@ is@@ ed in it , because it would be a kind of g@@ ast@@ ron@@ om@@ ic R@@ us@@ si@@ an rou@@ let@@ te ."
S@@ ome@@ times you have a to@@ x@@ ic blo@@ om ; sometimes you don &apos;t .
That doesn &apos;t se@@ ll .
"The really sc@@ ary things though are the physi@@ cal , chemi@@ cal , oce@@ an@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c things that are happening ."
"As the surface of the ocean gets war@@ m@@ er , the water is li@@ gh@@ ter when it &apos;s war@@ m@@ er , it be@@ comes har@@ der and har@@ der to turn the ocean over ."
We say it be@@ comes more stron@@ g@@ ly str@@ ati@@ f@@ ied .
"The con@@ sequ@@ ence of that is that all those nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ ts that fu@@ el the great an@@ cho@@ ve@@ ta fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies , of the s@@ ar@@ din@@ es of C@@ alifor@@ nia or in P@@ er@@ u or whatever , those s@@ low down and those fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies col@@ lap@@ se ."
"And , at the same time , water from the surface , which is ri@@ ch in o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en , doesn &apos;t make it down and the ocean turns into a des@@ er@@ t ."
So the question is : How are we all going to re@@ spo@@ nd to this ?
"And we can do all sor@@ ts of things to fi@@ x it , but in the fin@@ al an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s , the thing we really need to fi@@ x is ourselves ."
It &apos;s not about the fish ; it &apos;s not about the pol@@ lu@@ tion ; it &apos;s not about the clim@@ ate change .
It &apos;s about us and our gre@@ ed and our need for grow@@ th and our in@@ ability to imagine a world that is different from the sel@@ fish world we live in today .
So the question is : Wi@@ ll we re@@ spo@@ nd to this or not ?
I would say that the future of life and the di@@ gni@@ ty of human be@@ ings depen@@ ds on our doing that .
Thank you . ( Applause )

"Now you may ask , why have I done these things ?"
It started a couple of years ago .
"Well , I was sur@@ pri@@ sed . I did not know this ."
So I dow@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed the sh@@ e@@ et music and started playing .
"And what happened next was that I en@@ ter@@ ed this state of pu@@ re , un@@ pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ced amaz@@ ement ."
"It was an experience of being tot@@ ally in a@@ we of the music , and I had not felt that in a long time ."
It might be e@@ as@@ ier to rel@@ ate to this when you hear it .
The first piece that I pla@@ yed through started like this .
"( Music ) Well this sounds very me@@ lan@@ cho@@ li@@ c , doesn &apos;t it ?"
"So within a couple of minutes , and the piece isn &apos;t even fini@@ shed yet , I exper@@ ien@@ ced two very con@@ tra@@ st@@ ing char@@ ac@@ ters : beautiful me@@ lan@@ cho@@ ly and sh@@ e@@ er energy ."
And I consi@@ der these two ele@@ ments to be vi@@ tal human ex@@ pres@@ sions .
And the pu@@ ri@@ ty of the music makes you hear it very effe@@ cti@@ vely .
"I &apos;ve given a lot of children &apos;s con@@ cer@@ ts for children of seven and eight years old , and whatever I play , whether it &apos;s B@@ ach , Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven , even S@@ to@@ ck@@ ha@@ us@@ en , or some j@@ az@@ zy music , they are open to hear it , really wil@@ ling to list@@ en , and they are comfor@@ table doing so ."
"And when clas@@ ses come in with children who are just a few years ol@@ der , 11 , 12 , I felt that I sometimes already had t@@ rou@@ ble in re@@ ach@@ ing them like that ."
"The comple@@ x@@ ity of the music does become an issue , and actually the op@@ ini@@ ons of others — parents , friends , media — they start to coun@@ t ."
"But the young ones , they don &apos;t question their own op@@ ini@@ on ."
"They are in this con@@ st@@ ant state of won@@ der , and I do fir@@ m@@ ly believe that we can keep list@@ ening like these se@@ ven@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old children , even when grow@@ ing up ."
"And that is why I have pla@@ yed not only in the con@@ cer@@ t h@@ all but also on the stre@@ et , on@@ line , in the air : to feel that state of won@@ der , to tru@@ ly list@@ en , and to list@@ en without pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce ."
And I would like to in@@ vi@@ te you to do so now .

"Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : E@@ l@@ on , what kind of c@@ razy dre@@ am would per@@ su@@ ade you to think of trying to take on the au@@ to indu@@ stry and build an al@@ l-@@ electri@@ c car ?"
"E@@ l@@ on M@@ us@@ k : Well , it goes back to when I was in uni@@ versity ."
"I thought about , what are the problems that are most li@@ ke@@ ly to af@@ fe@@ ct the future of the world or the future of hum@@ ani@@ ty ?"
I think it &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly important that we have susta@@ in@@ able transpor@@ t and susta@@ in@@ able energy produ@@ ction .
"That sort of over@@ all susta@@ in@@ able energy problem is the bi@@ ggest problem that we have to sol@@ ve this century , in@@ depen@@ dent of environ@@ ment@@ al con@@ cer@@ ns ."
"In fact , even if produ@@ cing C@@ O@@ 2 was good for the environment , given that we &apos;re going to run out of hy@@ dro@@ car@@ b@@ ons , we need to find some susta@@ in@@ able means of oper@@ ating ."
CA : Mo@@ st of American electri@@ city comes from bur@@ ning f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els .
How can an electri@@ c car that p@@ lu@@ gs into that electri@@ city help ?
E@@ M : R@@ ight . There &apos;s two ele@@ ments to that answer .
"One is that , even if you take the same source fu@@ el and produ@@ ce power at the power pl@@ ant and use it to char@@ ge electri@@ c cars , you &apos;re still better off ."
"So if you take , say , natural gas , which is the most pre@@ val@@ ent hy@@ dro@@ car@@ b@@ on source fu@@ el , if you bur@@ n that in a moder@@ n G@@ ener@@ al E@@ le@@ ctri@@ c natural gas tur@@ b@@ ine , you &apos;ll get about 60 percent ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy ."
"If you put that same fu@@ el in an inter@@ na@@ l com@@ bu@@ sti@@ on eng@@ ine car , you get about 20 percent ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy ."
"And the reason is , in the st@@ ati@@ on@@ ary power pl@@ ant , you can af@@ for@@ d to have something that we@@ igh@@ s a lot more , is vol@@ um@@ in@@ ous , and you can take the wa@@ ste he@@ at and run a ste@@ am tur@@ b@@ ine and gener@@ ate a secon@@ d@@ ary power source ."
"So in effe@@ ct , even after you &apos;ve taken trans@@ mis@@ sion lo@@ ss into ac@@ coun@@ t and everything , even using the same source fu@@ el , you &apos;re at least t@@ wi@@ ce as better off char@@ g@@ ing an electri@@ c car , then bur@@ ning it at the power pl@@ ant ."
CA : That scale deli@@ ver@@ s ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy .
"E@@ M : Yes , it does ."
"And then the other point is , we have to have susta@@ in@@ able means of power gener@@ ation any@@ way , electri@@ city gener@@ ation ."
"So given that we have to sol@@ ve susta@@ in@@ able electri@@ city gener@@ ation , then it makes sense for us to have electri@@ c cars as the mo@@ de of transpor@@ t ."
"CA : So we &apos;ve got some video here of the T@@ es@@ la being as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ led , which , if we could play that first video — So what is in@@ no@@ v@@ ative about this process in this ve@@ hi@@ cle ?"
"E@@ M : S@@ ure . So , in order to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate the adv@@ ent of electri@@ c transpor@@ t , and I should say that I think , actually , all mo@@ des of transpor@@ t will become fully electri@@ c with the i@@ ro@@ nic ex@@ cep@@ tion of ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts ."
There &apos;s just no way around N@@ ew@@ ton &apos;s third la@@ w .
The question is how do you ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate the adv@@ ent of electri@@ c transpor@@ t ?
"And in order to do that for cars , you have to come up with a really energy ef@@ fi@@ cient car , so that means making it incredi@@ bly light , and so what you &apos;re seeing here is the only al@@ l-@@ al@@ um@@ in@@ um body and ch@@ as@@ sis car made in Nor@@ th America ."
"In fact , we ap@@ pl@@ ied a lot of ro@@ ck@@ et design techni@@ qu@@ es to make the car light des@@ pi@@ te having a very large bat@@ tery p@@ ack ."
And then it also has the low@@ est dra@@ g co@@ ef@@ fi@@ cient of any car of its size .
"So as a resul@@ t , the energy us@@ age is very low , and it has the most adv@@ an@@ ced bat@@ tery p@@ ack , and that &apos;s what gi@@ ves it the r@@ ange that &apos;s compe@@ ti@@ tive , so you can actually have on the order of a 2@@ 5@@ 0-@@ mi@@ le r@@ ange ."
"CA : I mean , those bat@@ tery pac@@ ks are incredi@@ bly he@@ av@@ y , but you think the mat@@ h can still work out inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ently — by com@@ b@@ ining light body , he@@ av@@ y bat@@ tery , you can still ga@@ in spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy ."
"E@@ M : E@@ x@@ actly . The rest of the car has to be very light to of@@ f@@ set the mas@@ s of the p@@ ack , and then you have to have a low dra@@ g co@@ ef@@ fi@@ cient so that you have good high@@ way r@@ ange ."
"And in fact , cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers of the Mo@@ de@@ l S are sort of compe@@ ting with each other to try to get the high@@ est possible r@@ ange ."
I think somebody re@@ cent@@ ly got 4@@ 20 miles out of a single char@@ ge .
"CA : B@@ ru@@ no B@@ ow@@ den , who &apos;s here , did that , bro@@ ke the world recor@@ d@@ .@@ E@@ M : Con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations ."
"CA : That was the good news . The bad news was that to do it , he had to dri@@ ve at 18 miles an hour con@@ st@@ ant speed and got pul@@ led over by the cop@@ s . ( Laughter ) E@@ M : I mean , you can cer@@ tain@@ ly dri@@ ve — if you dri@@ ve it 6@@ 5 miles an hour , under nor@@ mal con@@ di@@ tions , 2@@ 50 miles is a reas@@ on@@ able number ."
CA : Let &apos;s show that second video show@@ ing the T@@ es@@ la in action on ice .
"N@@ ot at all a di@@ g at The New York T@@ im@@ es , this , by the way ."
What is the most sur@@ pri@@ sing thing about the experience of dri@@ ving the car ?
"E@@ M : In cre@@ ating an electri@@ c car , the respon@@ si@@ ven@@ ess of the car is really incredible ."
"So we wanted really to have people feel as though they &apos;ve almost got to mind me@@ ld with the car , so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one , and as you cor@@ ner and ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate , it just happens , like the car has E@@ S@@ P ."
You can do that with an electri@@ c car because of its respon@@ si@@ ven@@ ess .
You can &apos;t do that with a g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine car .
"I think that &apos;s really a pro@@ found difference , and people only experience that when they have a test dri@@ ve ."
"CA : I mean , this is a beautiful but ex@@ pen@@ sive car ."
Is there a ro@@ ad ma@@ p where this be@@ comes a mas@@ s@@ -@@ market ve@@ hi@@ cle ?
"E@@ M : Yeah . The go@@ al of T@@ es@@ la has always been to have a sort of thre@@ e-@@ ste@@ p process , where ver@@ sion one was an ex@@ pen@@ sive car at low v@@ olu@@ me , ver@@ sion two is medi@@ um pri@@ ced and medi@@ um v@@ olu@@ me , and then ver@@ sion three would be low pri@@ ce , high v@@ olu@@ me ."
So we &apos;re at ste@@ p two at this point .
"So we had a $ 10@@ 0,000 spor@@ ts car , which was the Ro@@ ad@@ ster ."
"Th@@ en we &apos;ve got the Mo@@ de@@ l S , which star@@ ts at around 5@@ 0,000 dollars ."
"And our third gener@@ ation car , which should hop@@ e@@ fully be out in about three or four years will be a $ 3@@ 0,000 car ."
"But wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;ve got really new technology , it gener@@ ally takes about three major ver@@ sions in order to make it a compe@@ l@@ ling mas@@ s@@ -@@ market produ@@ ct ."
"And so I think we &apos;re making pro@@ gre@@ ss in that dire@@ ction , and I feel con@@ fi@@ dent that we &apos;ll get there ."
"CA : I mean , right now , if you &apos;ve got a shor@@ t com@@ mu@@ te , you can dri@@ ve , you can get back , you can char@@ ge it at home ."
There isn &apos;t a huge n@@ ati@@ on@@ wi@@ de network of char@@ g@@ ing st@@ ations now that are f@@ ast .
"D@@ o you see that coming , really , tru@@ ly , or just on a few key rou@@ tes ?"
"E@@ M : There actually are far more char@@ g@@ ing st@@ ations than people realize , and at T@@ es@@ la we develo@@ ped something called a Su@@ per@@ char@@ g@@ ing technology , and we &apos;re of@@ fer@@ ing that if you bu@@ y a Mo@@ de@@ l S for f@@ ree , fore@@ ver ."
And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don &apos;t realize .
"We actually have C@@ alifor@@ nia and N@@ ev@@ ada co@@ vered , and we &apos;ve got the E@@ ast@@ er@@ n se@@ ab@@ o@@ ard from B@@ ost@@ on to D@@ .@@ C@@ . co@@ vered ."
"B@@ y the end of this year , you &apos;ll be able to dri@@ ve from L@@ .@@ A@@ . to New York just using the Su@@ per@@ char@@ ger network , which char@@ ges at five times the r@@ ate of anything else ."
"And the key thing is to have a r@@ ati@@ o of dri@@ ve to stop , to stop time , of about six or seven ."
"So if you dri@@ ve for three hours , you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes , because that &apos;s nor@@ m@@ ally what people will stop for ."
"So if you start a tri@@ p at 9 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , by no@@ on you want to stop to have a bi@@ te to e@@ at , h@@ it the re@@ stro@@ om , co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , and keep going ."
"CA : So your pro@@ posi@@ tion to con@@ sum@@ ers is , for the full char@@ ge , it could take an hour ."
So it &apos;s common — don &apos;t expe@@ ct to be out of here in 10 minutes .
"W@@ a@@ it for an hour , but the good news is , you &apos;re hel@@ ping sa@@ ve the planet , and by the way , the electri@@ city is f@@ ree . You don &apos;t pay anything ."
"E@@ M : A@@ c@@ tually , what we &apos;re expe@@ cting is for people to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes , not for an hour ."
"It &apos;s actually better to dri@@ ve for about maybe 1@@ 60 , 1@@ 70 miles and then stop for half an hour and then keep going ."
That &apos;s the natural c@@ ad@@ ence of a tri@@ p .
CA : All right . So this is only one str@@ ing to your energy b@@ ow .
You &apos;ve been working on this solar company S@@ ol@@ ar@@ C@@ ity .
What &apos;s un@@ usu@@ al about that ?
"E@@ M : Well , as I men@@ tion@@ ed ear@@ lie@@ r , we have to have susta@@ in@@ able electri@@ city produ@@ ction as well as con@@ sum@@ ption , so I &apos;m quite con@@ fi@@ dent that the pri@@ mar@@ y means of power gener@@ ation will be solar ."
"I mean , it &apos;s really indi@@ re@@ ct fu@@ sion , is what it is ."
"We &apos;ve got this gi@@ ant fu@@ sion gener@@ ator in the sk@@ y called the su@@ n , and we just need to ta@@ p a little bit of that energy for pur@@ pos@@ es of human ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation ."
What most people know but don &apos;t realize they know is that the world is almost enti@@ re@@ ly sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed already .
"If the su@@ n wasn &apos;t there , we &apos;d be a f@@ roz@@ en ice ball at three de@@ gre@@ es K@@ el@@ v@@ in , and the su@@ n pow@@ ers the entire system of pre@@ ci@@ pi@@ tation ."
The whole e@@ co@@ system is sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed .
"CA : But in a gal@@ l@@ on of g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine , you have , effe@@ cti@@ vely , thousands of years of su@@ n power com@@ pres@@ sed into a small space , so it &apos;s hard to make the num@@ bers work right now on solar , and to re@@ mot@@ ely compe@@ te with , for example , natural gas , f@@ rac@@ ked natural gas . How are you going to build a business here ?"
"E@@ M : Well actually , I &apos;m con@@ fi@@ dent that solar will be@@ at everything , h@@ ands down , inclu@@ ding natural gas ."
( Applause ) CA : How ?
"E@@ M : It must , actually . If it doesn &apos;t , we &apos;re in de@@ ep t@@ rou@@ ble ."
CA : But you &apos;re not sel@@ ling solar pan@@ els to con@@ sum@@ ers .
What are you doing ?
"E@@ M : No , we actually are . You can bu@@ y a solar system or you can le@@ ase a solar system ."
Mo@@ st people cho@@ ose to le@@ ase .
"And the thing about solar power is that it doesn &apos;t have any fe@@ ed sto@@ ck or oper@@ ational co@@ sts , so once it &apos;s in@@ stal@@ led , it &apos;s just there ."
It works for de@@ ca@@ des . It &apos;ll work for probably a century .
"So ther@@ e@@ fore , the key thing to do is to get the cost of that ini@@ tial in@@ stal@@ l@@ ation low , and then get the cost of the fin@@ an@@ cing low , because that inter@@ est — those are the two fac@@ t@@ ors that dri@@ ve the cost of solar ."
"And we &apos;ve made huge pro@@ gre@@ ss in that dire@@ ction , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m con@@ fi@@ dent we &apos;ll actually be@@ at natural gas ."
"CA : So your cur@@ r@@ ent pro@@ posi@@ tion to con@@ sum@@ ers is , don &apos;t pay so much up front ."
E@@ M : Z@@ er@@ o@@ .@@ CA : P@@ ay zer@@ o up front .
We will in@@ st@@ all pan@@ els on your ro@@ of .
"You will then pay , how long is a ty@@ pi@@ cal le@@ ase ?"
"E@@ M : Ty@@ pi@@ cal le@@ ases are 20 years , but the val@@ ue pro@@ posi@@ tion is , as you &apos;re sort of al@@ lu@@ ding to , quite stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward ."
"It &apos;s no money down , and your u@@ ti@@ lity bi@@ ll de@@ cre@@ ases ."
P@@ re@@ t@@ ty good deal .
CA : So that seem@@ s like a wi@@ n for the con@@ sum@@ er .
"No ri@@ sk , you &apos;ll pay less than you &apos;re pa@@ ying now ."
"For you , the dre@@ am here then is that — I mean , who ow@@ ns the electri@@ city from those pan@@ els for the longer ter@@ m ?"
"I mean , how do you , the company , b@@ en@@ ef@@ it ?"
"E@@ M : Well , essen@@ ti@@ ally , S@@ ol@@ ar@@ C@@ ity ra@@ is@@ es a ch@@ un@@ k of ca@@ pi@@ tal from say , a company or a b@@ ank ."
Go@@ og@@ le is one of our big part@@ n@@ ers here .
And they have an expe@@ cted re@@ turn on that ca@@ pi@@ tal .
"Wi@@ th that ca@@ pi@@ tal , S@@ ol@@ ar@@ C@@ ity pur@@ ch@@ ases and in@@ stal@@ ls the pan@@ el on the ro@@ of and then char@@ ges the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner or business ow@@ ner a mon@@ th@@ ly le@@ ase pa@@ y@@ ment , which is less than the u@@ ti@@ lity bi@@ ll ."
CA : But you yourself get a lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m comm@@ er@@ cial b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from that power .
You &apos;re kind of building a new ty@@ pe of di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted u@@ ti@@ lity .
E@@ M : E@@ x@@ actly . What it amoun@@ ts to is a gi@@ ant di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted u@@ ti@@ lity .
"I think it &apos;s a good thing , because u@@ ti@@ lit@@ ies have been this mon@@ o@@ po@@ ly , and people ha@@ ven &apos;t had any cho@@ ice ."
"So effe@@ cti@@ vely it &apos;s the first time there &apos;s been compe@@ ti@@ tion for this mon@@ o@@ po@@ ly , because the u@@ ti@@ lit@@ ies have been the only ones that ow@@ ned those power di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion lin@@ es , but now it &apos;s on your ro@@ of ."
So I think it &apos;s actually very em@@ power@@ ing for h@@ ome@@ ow@@ n@@ ers and bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es .
"CA : And you really picture a future where a maj@@ ori@@ ty of power in America , within a dec@@ ade or two , or within your li@@ fe@@ time , it goes solar ?"
"E@@ M : I &apos;m extre@@ me@@ ly con@@ fi@@ dent that solar will be at least a p@@ lu@@ r@@ ality of power , and most li@@ ke@@ ly a maj@@ ori@@ ty , and I pre@@ di@@ ct it will be a p@@ lu@@ r@@ ality in less than 20 years ."
I made that be@@ t with someone — CA : De@@ fini@@ tion of p@@ lu@@ r@@ ality is ?
E@@ M : M@@ ore from solar than any other source .
CA : A@@ h . Wh@@ o did you make the be@@ t with ?
E@@ M : Wi@@ th a friend who will re@@ ma@@ in na@@ me@@ less .
"CA : J@@ ust between us . ( Laughter ) E@@ M : I made that be@@ t , I think , two or three years ago , so in rou@@ gh@@ ly 18 years , I think we &apos;ll see more power from solar than any other source ."
"CA : All right , so let &apos;s go back to another be@@ t that you made with yourself , I gu@@ ess , a kind of c@@ razy be@@ t ."
You &apos;d made some money from the s@@ ale of P@@ a@@ y@@ P@@ al .
You decided to build a space company .
Why on Earth would someone do that ?
"( Laughter ) E@@ M : I got that question a lot , that &apos;s true ."
"P@@ e@@ ople would say , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you hear the jo@@ ke about the guy who made a small for@@ tu@@ ne in the space indu@@ stry ? &quot; &quot; O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , &quot; &quot; He started with a large one , &quot; &quot; is the pun@@ ch@@ line ."
"And so I tell people , well , I was trying to figure out the f@@ ast@@ est way to turn a large for@@ tu@@ ne into a small one ."
"And they &apos;d look at me , like , &quot; &quot; Is he seri@@ ous ? &quot; &quot; CA : And str@@ ang@@ ely , you were . So what happened ?"
E@@ M : It was a close call . Th@@ ings almost didn &apos;t work out .
"We came very close to fai@@ lu@@ re , but we man@@ aged to get through that point in 200@@ 8 ."
"The go@@ al of S@@ pac@@ e@@ X is to try to adv@@ ance ro@@ ck@@ et technology , and in particular to try to c@@ rac@@ k a problem that I think is vi@@ tal for hum@@ ani@@ ty to become a sp@@ ace@@ -@@ far@@ ing ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , which is to have a ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly and fully re@@ us@@ able ro@@ ck@@ et ."
CA : W@@ ould hum@@ ani@@ ty become a sp@@ ace@@ -@@ far@@ ing ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation ?
"So that was a dre@@ am of y@@ ours , in a way , from a young age ?"
You &apos;ve dre@@ am@@ ed of Mars and be@@ y@@ ond ?
"E@@ M : I did build ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts when I was a kid , but I didn &apos;t think I &apos;d be inv@@ olved in this ."
It was really more from the stan@@ d@@ point of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exci@@ ting and in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing one ?
"And I really think there &apos;s a fundam@@ ent@@ al difference , if you sort of look into the future , between a hum@@ ani@@ ty that is a sp@@ ace@@ -@@ far@@ ing ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , that &apos;s out there expl@@ or@@ ing the star@@ s , on mul@@ ti@@ ple plane@@ ts , and I think that &apos;s really exci@@ ting , com@@ par@@ ed with one where we are fore@@ ver con@@ fin@@ ed to Earth until some ev@@ entu@@ al ex@@ t@@ in@@ ction ev@@ ent ."
"CA : So you &apos;ve some@@ how s@@ las@@ h@@ ed the cost of building a ro@@ ck@@ et by 7@@ 5 percent , depen@@ ding on how you cal@@ cul@@ ate it ."
How on Earth have you done that ?
N@@ A@@ SA has been doing this for years . How have you done this ?
"E@@ M : Well , we &apos;ve made sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant adv@@ an@@ ces in the technology of the air@@ fra@@ me , the en@@ gin@@ es , the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs and the la@@ un@@ ch oper@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s a long li@@ st of in@@ no@@ v@@ ations that we &apos;ve come up with there that are a little difficult to communi@@ cate in this talk , but — CA : N@@ ot least because you could still get cop@@ ied , right ?"
You ha@@ ven &apos;t pat@@ en@@ ted this stuff . It &apos;s really interesting to me .
"E@@ M : No , we don &apos;t pat@@ ent@@ .@@ CA : You didn &apos;t pat@@ ent because you think it &apos;s more d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous to pat@@ ent than not to pat@@ ent ."
"E@@ M : S@@ in@@ ce our pri@@ mar@@ y compe@@ ti@@ t@@ ors are national govern@@ ments , the en@@ for@@ ce@@ ability of pat@@ ents is questi@@ on@@ able . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : That &apos;s really , really interesting ."
"But the big in@@ no@@ vation is still a@@ head , and you &apos;re working on it now . T@@ ell us about this ."
"E@@ M : R@@ ight , so the big in@@ no@@ vation — CA : In fact , let &apos;s ro@@ ll that video and you can talk us through it , what &apos;s happening here ."
E@@ M : A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely . So the thing about ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts is that they &apos;re all ex@@ pen@@ d@@ able .
All ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts that f@@ ly today are fully ex@@ pen@@ d@@ able .
"The space sh@@ ut@@ tle was an at@@ tem@@ pt at a re@@ us@@ able ro@@ ck@@ et , but even the ma@@ in t@@ ank of the space sh@@ ut@@ tle was th@@ row@@ n away every time , and the par@@ ts that were re@@ us@@ able took a 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ person group n@@ ine months to ref@@ ur@@ bi@@ sh for f@@ light ."
So the space sh@@ ut@@ tle en@@ ded up co@@ st@@ ing a billion dollars per f@@ light .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously that doesn &apos;t work very well for — CA : What just happened there ? We just saw something land ?
"E@@ M : That &apos;s right . So it &apos;s important that the ro@@ ck@@ et st@@ ages be able to come back , to be able to re@@ turn to the la@@ un@@ ch site and be ready to la@@ un@@ ch again within a matter of hours ."
"CA : W@@ ow . Re@@ us@@ able ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t@@ s@@ .@@ E@@ M : Yes . ( Applause ) And so what a lot of people don &apos;t realize is , the cost of the fu@@ el , of the pro@@ pe@@ ll@@ ant , is very small ."
It &apos;s much like on a je@@ t .
So the cost of the pro@@ pe@@ ll@@ ant is about .@@ 3 percent of the cost of the ro@@ ck@@ et .
"So it &apos;s possible to ach@@ ie@@ ve , let &apos;s say , rou@@ gh@@ ly 10@@ 0-@@ f@@ old impro@@ v@@ ement in the cost of sp@@ ac@@ ef@@ light if you can effe@@ cti@@ vely re@@ use the ro@@ ck@@ et ."
That &apos;s why it &apos;s so important .
"E@@ very mo@@ de of transpor@@ t that we use , whether it &apos;s plan@@ es , tra@@ ins , au@@ tom@@ ob@@ i@@ les , bi@@ k@@ es , hor@@ ses , is re@@ us@@ able , but not ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts ."
So we must sol@@ ve this problem in order to become a sp@@ ace@@ -@@ far@@ ing ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation .
CA : You asked me the question ear@@ lie@@ r of how popul@@ ar tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing on c@@ ru@@ is@@ es would be if you had to bur@@ n your ships af@@ ter@@ war@@ d@@ .@@ E@@ M : C@@ er@@ tain c@@ ru@@ is@@ es are ap@@ par@@ ently high@@ ly proble@@ m@@ atic .
CA : De@@ fini@@ tely more ex@@ pen@@ sive .
"So that &apos;s poten@@ ti@@ ally absolu@@ tely dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tive technology , and , I gu@@ ess , pa@@ ves the way for your dre@@ am to actually take , at some point , to take hum@@ ani@@ ty to Mars at scale ."
You &apos;d like to see a col@@ ony on Mars .
"E@@ M : Yeah , exactly . S@@ pac@@ e@@ X , or some com@@ bin@@ ation of comp@@ an@@ ies and govern@@ ments , needs to make pro@@ gre@@ ss in the dire@@ ction of making life mul@@ ti@@ -@@ plan@@ et@@ ary , of est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing a b@@ ase on another planet , on Mars — being the only reali@@ stic op@@ tion — and then building that b@@ ase up until we &apos;re a true mul@@ ti@@ -@@ planet species ."
"CA : So pro@@ gre@@ ss on this &quot; &quot; let &apos;s make it re@@ us@@ able , &quot; &quot; how is that going ? That was just a si@@ mul@@ ation video we saw ."
How &apos;s it going ?
"E@@ M : We &apos;re actually , we &apos;ve been making some good pro@@ gre@@ ss re@@ cent@@ ly with something we call the G@@ ra@@ s@@ sh@@ op@@ per T@@ est Pro@@ je@@ ct , where we &apos;re test@@ ing the ver@@ tical lan@@ ding por@@ tion of the f@@ light , the sort of ter@@ min@@ al por@@ tion which is quite tri@@ ck@@ y ."
And we &apos;ve had some good te@@ sts .
CA : C@@ an we see that ? E@@ M : Yeah .
So that &apos;s just to give a sense of scale .
"We dre@@ s@@ sed a c@@ ow@@ bo@@ y as Joh@@ n@@ ny C@@ as@@ h and b@@ ol@@ ted the man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in to the ro@@ ck@@ et . ( Laughter ) CA : All right , let &apos;s see that video then , because this is actually amazing when you think about it ."
"You &apos;ve never seen this before . A ro@@ ck@@ et b@@ la@@ st@@ ing off and then — E@@ M : Yeah , so that ro@@ ck@@ et is about the size of a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ story building ."
"( Ro@@ ck@@ et la@@ un@@ ch ) So now it &apos;s ho@@ ver@@ ing at about 40 me@@ ters , and it &apos;s con@@ stan@@ tly ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ing the ang@@ le , the pit@@ ch and y@@ a@@ w of the ma@@ in eng@@ ine , and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ining ro@@ ll with c@@ old gas th@@ ru@@ st@@ ers ."
"CA : How cool is that ? ( Applause ) E@@ l@@ on , how have you done this ?"
"These proje@@ cts are so — P@@ a@@ y@@ p@@ al , S@@ ol@@ ar@@ C@@ ity , T@@ es@@ la , S@@ pac@@ e@@ X , they &apos;re so spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ u@@ lar@@ ly different , they &apos;re such am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous proje@@ cts at scale ."
How on Earth has one person been able to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate in this way ?
What is it about you ?
"E@@ M : I don &apos;t know , actually ."
I don &apos;t have a good answer for you .
"I work a lot . I mean , a lot ."
"CA : Well , I have a the@@ ory@@ .@@ E@@ M : O@@ kay . All right ."
"CA : My the@@ ory is that you have an ability to think at a system level of design that pul@@ ls together design , technology and business , so if TED was T@@ B@@ D , design , technology and business , into one pac@@ k@@ age , syn@@ the@@ size it in a way that very few people can and — and this is the cri@@ tical thing — feel so dam@@ n con@@ fi@@ dent in that cli@@ ck@@ ed@@ -@@ together pac@@ k@@ age that you take c@@ razy ri@@ sk@@ s ."
"You be@@ t your for@@ tu@@ ne on it , and you se@@ em to have done that mul@@ ti@@ ple times ."
"I mean , almost no one can do that ."
Is that — could we have some of that se@@ cre@@ t sa@@ u@@ ce ?
C@@ an we put it into our education system ? C@@ an someone learn from you ?
It is tru@@ ly amazing what you &apos;ve done .
"E@@ M : Well , th@@ an@@ ks . Thank you ."
"Well , I do think there &apos;s a good fra@@ me@@ work for thinking ."
"It is physi@@ cs . You know , the sort of first prin@@ ci@@ ples reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"G@@ ener@@ ally I think there are — what I mean by that is , bo@@ il things down to their fundam@@ ent@@ al tru@@ ths and reason up from there , as op@@ posed to reas@@ on@@ ing by an@@ al@@ og@@ y ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh most of our life , we get through life by reas@@ on@@ ing by an@@ al@@ og@@ y , which essen@@ ti@@ ally means cop@@ ying what other people do with s@@ light v@@ ari@@ ations ."
And you have to do that .
"O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , ment@@ ally , you wouldn &apos;t be able to get through the day ."
"But when you want to do something new , you have to app@@ ly the physi@@ cs appro@@ ach ."
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ cs is really fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing out how to disco@@ ver new things that are coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive , like qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m mechani@@ cs ."
It &apos;s really coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive .
"So I think that &apos;s an important thing to do , and then also to really pay at@@ ten@@ tion to neg@@ ative fe@@ ed@@ back , and so@@ lic@@ it it , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly from friends ."
"This may sound like simple ad@@ vice , but har@@ d@@ ly any@@ one does that , and it &apos;s incredi@@ bly hel@@ p@@ ful ."
"CA : Bo@@ ys and girls wat@@ ching , study physi@@ cs ."
L@@ ear@@ n from this man .
"E@@ l@@ on M@@ us@@ k , I wi@@ sh we had all day , but th@@ ank you so much for coming to TED ."
"E@@ M : Thank you . CA : That was aw@@ es@@ ome . That was really , really cool ."
L@@ ook at that . ( Applause ) J@@ ust take a b@@ ow . That was fanta@@ stic .
Thank you so much .
"I have , like , a thing about sle@@ e@@ ping ."
"I don &apos;t sle@@ ep that much , and I &apos;ve come to this thing about , like , not sle@@ e@@ ping much as being a great vi@@ r@@ tu@@ e , after years of kind of bat@@ t@@ ling it as being a terri@@ ble de@@ tri@@ ment , or something ."
"And now I really like sort of sitting up , you know ."
"But for years I &apos;ve been sitting up and I think that , like , my cre@@ ati@@ vity is gre@@ at@@ ly moti@@ v@@ ated by this kind of in@@ som@@ nia ."
I lie a@@ wa@@ ke . I think thou@@ ghts . I walk a@@ im@@ l@@ ess@@ ly .
S@@ ome@@ times I used to walk more at night .
I walk during the day and I fol@@ low people who I think look interesting .
"( Laughter ) And sometimes — actually , once it was on P@@ age S@@ i@@ x in the Po@@ st , that I was c@@ ru@@ is@@ ing this guy , like , sort of , whatever , but I was actually just fol@@ low@@ ing because he had these really great sho@@ es on ."
And so I was fol@@ low@@ ing this guy .
"And I took a picture of his sho@@ es , and we th@@ an@@ ked each other and just went on our way ."
But I do that all the time .
"As a matter of fact , I think a lot of my design ideas come from mist@@ ak@@ es and tri@@ cks of the ey@@ e ."
"Because I feel like , you know , there are so many images out there , so many clo@@ the@@ s out there ."
"And the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look sli@@ gh@@ tly mist@@ ak@@ en , of course , or very , very sur@@ pri@@ sing ."
"And often , I &apos;m dri@@ ving in a ta@@ x@@ i and I see a ho@@ le in a sh@@ ir@@ t , or something that looks very interesting or pretty or fun@@ cti@@ onal in some way that I &apos;d never seen happen before ."
"And so I &apos;d make the car stop , and I &apos;d get out of the car and walk , and see that in fact there wasn &apos;t a ho@@ le , but it was a tri@@ ck of my ey@@ e , it was a sha@@ do@@ w , you know ."
"O@@ r if there was a ho@@ le I &apos;d think like , oh dam@@ n , there was actually someone thought of that thought already ."
S@@ ome@@ one made that mist@@ ake already so I can &apos;t do it any@@ more .
I don &apos;t know where in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation comes from .
It does not come for me from research .
I don &apos;t get ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly inspi@@ red by research .
"As a matter of fact , one of the most fun things I &apos;ve ever , ever done in my whole life , was this Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as se@@ as@@ on at the G@@ u@@ g@@ gen@@ he@@ im in New York ."
I read &quot; &quot; Pe@@ ter and the W@@ ol@@ f &quot; &quot; with this beautiful b@@ and from Ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard .
"And I did like , you know , the nar@@ rat@@ or , and I read it ."
And I saw this really s@@ mar@@ t cri@@ tic who I love .
"This woman , Jo@@ an A@@ co@@ cel@@ la , who &apos;s a friend of m@@ ine , and she came back@@ st@@ age and she said , oh , you know , I@@ sa@@ a@@ c , did you know that , talking about S@@ tal@@ in@@ is@@ m and talking about , you know , like the &apos; 3@@ 0s in R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
"And I said , how do I know about S@@ tal@@ in@@ is@@ m ?"
"I know about a wol@@ f and a bir@@ d and , you know , he ate the bir@@ d , and then in the end you hear , you know , you hear the bir@@ d squ@@ e@@ aking , or something , you know ?"
"So I don &apos;t really know that . I don &apos;t really — actually I do my own kind of research , you know ."
"If I &apos;m com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed to do the co@@ st@@ um@@ es for an 1@@ 8@@ th@@ -@@ century op@@ era , or something like that , I will do a lot of research , because it &apos;s interesting , not because it &apos;s what I &apos;m sup@@ posed to do ."
"I &apos;m very , very , very inspi@@ red by mov@@ ies ."
"The color of mov@@ ies and the way light makes the col@@ ors , light from behind the proje@@ ction , or light from the proje@@ ction , makes the col@@ ors look so im@@ possible ."

"W@@ he@@ ther they &apos;re kind of gl@@ ori@@ f@@ ied in this way , or whether they &apos;re kind of , you know , i@@ ro@@ ni@@ cally gl@@ ori@@ f@@ ied , or whether they &apos;re , you know , sort of d@@ eni@@ gr@@ ated , or i@@ ro@@ ni@@ cally d@@ eni@@ gr@@ ated ."
I go back to color all the time .
Co@@ lor is something that moti@@ v@@ ates me a lot .
"It &apos;s r@@ are@@ ly color that I find in nature , al@@ though , you know , ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posed next to arti@@ fi@@ cial color , natural color is so beautiful ."
So that &apos;s what I do . I study color a lot .
"But for the most part , I think , like , how can I ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of N@@ at@@ al@@ ie W@@ o@@ od ?"
How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Gre@@ ta G@@ ar@@ bo ?
"I mean , that &apos;s just not possible , you know ."
"And so that &apos;s what makes me lie a@@ wa@@ ke at night , I gu@@ ess , you know ."
"I want to show you — I &apos;m also like a big — I go to ast@@ ro@@ log@@ ers and ta@@ ro@@ t car@@ d re@@ ad@@ ers often , and that &apos;s another thing that moti@@ v@@ ates me a lot ."
"P@@ e@@ ople say , oh , do that . A@@ n ast@@ ro@@ lo@@ ger tel@@ ls me to do something ."
So I do it .
"( Laughter ) When I was about 2@@ 1 , an ast@@ ro@@ lo@@ ger told me that I was going to me@@ et the man of my dre@@ am@@ s , and that his name was going to be E@@ ri@@ c , right ?"
"So , you know , for years I would go to bar@@ s and , sort of , any@@ one I met wh@@ ose name was E@@ ri@@ c I was hum@@ ping im@@ medi@@ ately , or something ."
"( Laughter ) And there were times when I was actually so des@@ per@@ ate I would just , you know , walk into a room and just go like , &quot; &quot; E@@ ri@@ c ! &quot; &quot; And any@@ body who would turn around I would , sort of , make a be@@ el@@ ine for . ( Laughter )"
And I had this really interesting ta@@ ro@@ t re@@ ading a long time ago .
"The last car@@ d he pul@@ led , which was re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing my de@@ st@@ iny was this guy on like a stra@@ w bo@@ ater with a c@@ ane and you know , sort of sp@@ ats and this , you know , a min@@ stre@@ l sing@@ er , right ?"
I want to show you this cli@@ p because I do this kind of c@@ razy thing where I do a c@@ ab@@ ar@@ et act .
"So actually , che@@ ck this out ."
V@@ ery em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) : Thank you . We can do anything you ask .
The name of the show is based on this story that I have to tell you about my mother .
It &apos;s sort of an ex@@ cer@@ pt from a quot@@ e of h@@ ers .
"I was d@@ ating this guy , right ?"
"And this has to do with being happy , I s@@ we@@ ar ."
"I was d@@ ating this guy and it was going on for about a year , right ."
"And we were getting seri@@ ous , so we decided to in@@ vi@@ te them all to din@@ ner , our parents ."
"And we , you know , sort of in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced them to each other ."
"My mother was , sort of , very sen@@ si@@ tive to his mother , who it seem@@ ed was a little bit sk@@ e@@ p@@ tical about the whole alter@@ n@@ ative li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le thing ."
"You know , hom@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ ality , right ?"
"So my mother was a little of@@ f@@ en@@ ded . She turned to her and she said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you ki@@ d@@ ding ? They have the gre@@ at@@ est life together ."
"They e@@ at out , they see shows . &quot; &quot; They e@@ at out , they see shows ."
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s the name of the show , they e@@ at out , they — that &apos;s on my tom@@ b@@ st@@ one when I die ."
"&quot; &quot; He ate out , he saw shows , &quot; &quot; right ?"
"So in e@@ di@@ ting these cli@@ ps , I didn &apos;t have the aud@@ aci@@ ty to ed@@ it a cli@@ p of me sing@@ ing at Jo@@ e &apos;s P@@ u@@ b ."
"So you &apos;ll have to , like , go che@@ ck it out and come see me or something ."
"Because it &apos;s mor@@ ti@@ f@@ ying , and yet it feel@@ s ..."
I don &apos;t know how to put this .
"I feel as little comfor@@ t as possible is a good thing , you know ."
"And at least , you know , in my case , because if I just do one thing all the time , I don &apos;t know , I get very , very bo@@ red . I bor@@ e very e@@ a@@ si@@ ly ."
"And you know , I don &apos;t say that I do everything well , I just say that I do a lot of things , that &apos;s all ."
"And I kind of try not to look back , you know ."
"E@@ x@@ cept , I gu@@ ess , that &apos;s what sta@@ ying up every night is about ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , looking back and thinking , what a fo@@ ol you made of yourself , you know ."
But I gu@@ ess that &apos;s o@@ kay . R@@ ight ?
"Because if you do many things you get to feel l@@ ous@@ y about everything , and not just one , you know ."
You don &apos;t ma@@ ster feeling l@@ ous@@ y about one thing .
"@@ Yeah , exactly ."
"I will show you this next thing , spe@@ aking of co@@ st@@ um@@ es for oper@@ as ."
I do work with different cho@@ re@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ers .
"I work with T@@ wy@@ la Th@@ ar@@ p a lot , and I work with Mar@@ k M@@ or@@ ris a lot , who is one of my best friends ."
"And I desig@@ ned three oper@@ as with him , and the most re@@ cent one , &quot; &quot; K@@ ing Ar@@ th@@ ur . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d been very in@@ gra@@ ined in the dance world since I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er ."
"I went to perform@@ ing ar@@ ts high school , where I was an ac@@ tor ."
And many of my friends were bal@@ let dan@@ c@@ ers .
"A@@ ga@@ in , I don &apos;t know where in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation comes from ."
I don &apos;t know where it comes from .
I started making pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts when I was a kid .
"M@@ a@@ ybe that &apos;s where the whole in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation thing started from , pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts , right ."
And then perform@@ ing ar@@ ts high school .
"There I was in high school , me@@ e@@ ting dan@@ c@@ ers and ac@@ ting ."
"And some@@ how , from there , I got interested in design ."
I went to Par@@ s@@ ons S@@ cho@@ ol of De@@ sig@@ n and then I began my car@@ e@@ er as a desig@@ ner .
"I don &apos;t really think of myself as a desig@@ ner , I don &apos;t really think of myself ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly as a fas@@ hi@@ on desig@@ ner ."
"And f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , I don &apos;t really know what to call myself ."
I think of myself as a ... I don &apos;t know what I think of myself as .
It &apos;s just that .
"( Laughter ) But I must say , this whole thing about being sli@@ gh@@ tly bo@@ red all the time , that is what — I think that is a very important thing for a fas@@ hi@@ on desig@@ ner ."
You always have to be sli@@ gh@@ tly bo@@ red with everything .
"And if you &apos;re not , you have to pre@@ ten@@ d to be sli@@ gh@@ tly bo@@ red with everything ."
( Laughter ) But I am really a little bo@@ red with everything .
"I always say to my part@@ ner , Mar@@ is@@ a G@@ ar@@ din@@ i , who boo@@ ks everything — she boo@@ ks everything and she makes everything happen ."
And she makes all the de@@ als .
And I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bri@@ dge program .
"T@@ o@@ o much time on computer bri@@ dge , which is , you know , like that &apos;s so ... some@@ how , like , about ten years ago I thought that the most un@@ bor@@ ing place in the world would be like a T@@ .@@ V@@ . studi@@ o , like for a day show . S@@ ome kind of day talk show ."
Because it &apos;s all of these things that I love all kind of in one place .
"And if you ever get bo@@ red you can look at another thing , and do another thing and talk about it , right ?"
And so I had this T@@ .@@ V@@ . show .
"And that was a very , very , very big part of my process ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , could you ro@@ ll the cli@@ p , ple@@ ase ?"
This is one of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te cli@@ ps of R@@ os@@ ie .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) I@@ sa@@ a@@ c Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ h@@ i : We &apos;re back on the set .
H@@ i there .
"R@@ os@@ ie O &apos;@@ D@@ on@@ ne@@ ll : H@@ el@@ l@@ o , B@@ en ."
"I@@ M : L@@ ook how cu@@ te she looks with this , just a sli@@ ck back ."
"M@@ an : H@@ er grand@@ mother says , &quot; &quot; De@@ li@@ sh ! &quot; &quot; I@@ M : A@@ h , wo@@ w , deli@@ sh . All right . So now where should I posi@@ tion myself ?"
I want to st@@ ay out of the way .
I don &apos;t want to be — o@@ kay . Here we go .
"D@@ o you get ner@@ v@@ ous , A@@ sh@@ le@@ i@@ gh ?"
A@@ sh@@ le@@ i@@ gh : D@@ o@@ ing what ?
R@@ O@@ D : C@@ u@@ tting ha@@ ir .
"A : C@@ u@@ tting ha@@ ir ? N@@ ever , never ."
I don &apos;t think there was ever a day where I cut ha@@ ir I was ner@@ v@@ ous .
"I@@ M : You look so cu@@ te already , by the way ."
R@@ O@@ D : You like it ? All right .
I@@ M : Do you have a problem with looking cu@@ te ? You want to look cu@@ te .
R@@ O@@ D : O@@ f course I want to look cu@@ te .
"I@@ M : J@@ ust che@@ c@@ king , because some people want to look , you know , ag@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vely u@@ g@@ ly ."
"R@@ O@@ D : No , not me , no ."
"I@@ M : You read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up some@@ how , like , really mess@@ ed up , you know what I mean ?"
"And there &apos;s got to be some way to do that , R@@ os@@ ie ."
"Because just because if you &apos;re f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ously ri@@ ch , and f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ously fam@@ ous , does that mean you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have kids , because you know they &apos;re going to end up getting mess@@ ed up ?"
"R@@ O@@ D : No , but it means that your pri@@ ori@@ ty has to be their wel@@ l-@@ being first , I think ."
But you have to make the deci@@ sion for yourself .
"My kids are seven , who the he@@ ll know@@ s ."
They &apos;re going to be like 14 and in re@@ ha@@ b .
And they &apos;re going to be playing this cli@@ p : &quot; I &apos;m such a good mother . &quot;
"My God , this is the shor@@ test I &apos;ve ever had ."
"I@@ M : It looks good , ye@@ ah ?"
"A : I was going to ask you , has your ha@@ ir ever been — R@@ O@@ D : No ! It &apos;s all right — go c@@ razy ."
I@@ M : I feel like it needs to be a little clo@@ s@@ er down here .
"A : Oh no , we &apos;re just st@@ ag@@ ing , R@@ O@@ D : We &apos;re just st@@ ag@@ ing it ."
I@@ M : A@@ re you fre@@ aking out ? You look so cu@@ te .
"R@@ O@@ D : No , I love it . It &apos;s the new me ."
"I@@ M : Oh , it &apos;s so f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous !"
R@@ O@@ D : F@@ lo@@ ck of R@@ os@@ ie . W@@ o@@ o@@ o !
"I@@ M : So by the way . O@@ f all the most un@@ bor@@ ing things in the world , right ."
"I mean , like making someone who &apos;s already cu@@ te look terri@@ ble like that ."
That is not bor@@ ing . That is nothing if it &apos;s not bor@@ ing .
"A@@ c@@ tually , I read this great quot@@ e the other day , which was , &quot; S@@ tyle makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you &apos;re going to die . &quot;"
"R@@ ight ? And then I realized , that was on my we@@ b@@ site , and then it said , like , you know , the quot@@ e was at@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted to me and I thought , oh , I said something , you know , in an inter@@ view ."
I for@@ got that I said that . But it &apos;s really true .
I want to show you this last cli@@ p because it &apos;s going to be my last go@@ od@@ by@@ e .
I &apos;ll tell you that I co@@ ok a lot also . I love to co@@ ok .
And I often look at things as though they &apos;re food .
"L@@ i@@ ke I say , oh , you know , would you ser@@ ve a ro@@ t@@ ten chi@@ ck@@ en ?"
"Th@@ en how could you ser@@ ve , you know , a be@@ at up old dre@@ ss or something ."
How could you show a be@@ at up old dre@@ ss ?
I always rel@@ ate things to k@@ it@@ ch@@ en@@ -@@ ry .
And so I think that &apos;s what it all bo@@ il@@ s down to .
E@@ very@@ thing bo@@ il@@ s down to that .
So che@@ ck this out .
This is what I &apos;ve been doing because I think it &apos;s the most fun thing in the world .
"It &apos;s , like , this we@@ b@@ site ."
It &apos;s got a lot of different things on it .
It &apos;s a po@@ ly@@ ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal we@@ b@@ site .
We actually sho@@ ot se@@ g@@ ments like T@@ .@@ V@@ . show se@@ g@@ ments .
And it &apos;s kind of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te thing in the world .
And it just began like in the beginning of F@@ e@@ bru@@ ary . So who know@@ s ?
"And again , I don &apos;t say it &apos;s good , I just think it &apos;s not bor@@ ing , right ?"
And here is the last bit .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) I@@ M : I have to tell you , I make bu@@ t@@ ter@@ mi@@ l@@ k pan@@ c@@ ak@@ es or bu@@ t@@ ter@@ mi@@ l@@ k wa@@ f@@ f@@ les all the time ."
Ch@@ e@@ f : Do you ?
"I@@ M : Yeah , but I can never find bu@@ t@@ ter@@ mi@@ l@@ k , ever ."
Ch@@ e@@ f : Oh .
I@@ M : You can &apos;t find bu@@ t@@ ter@@ mi@@ l@@ k at C@@ it@@ ar@@ el@@ la ; you can &apos;t find bu@@ t@@ ter@@ mi@@ l@@ k .
Ch@@ e@@ f : You can &apos;t ?
I@@ M : It &apos;s always low@@ -@@ f@@ at bu@@ t@@ ter@@ mi@@ l@@ k .
"Ch@@ e@@ f : No , but that &apos;s all it is ."
I@@ M : Is that all it is ?
"Ch@@ e@@ f : Oh , you don &apos;t know ? Let me tell you something ."
Let me tell you something interesting .
I@@ M : You know what ? S@@ top l@@ augh@@ ing . It &apos;s not fun@@ ny .
J@@ ust because I don &apos;t know that whole — that there &apos;s no such thing as whole bu@@ t@@ ter@@ mi@@ l@@ k .
"S@@ or@@ ry , what ?"
"Ch@@ e@@ f : Well , here &apos;s the deal . Let me tell you the deal ."
"In the old days when they used to make bu@@ t@@ ter , you know how you make bu@@ t@@ ter ?"
I@@ M : Ch@@ ur@@ ns ?
Ch@@ e@@ f : F@@ or cre@@ am ?
"I@@ M : Yeah , exactly ."
"Ch@@ e@@ f : So you take he@@ av@@ y , high-@@ f@@ at mi@@ l@@ k , which is cre@@ am , and you ch@@ ur@@ n it until it se@@ par@@ ates into these cur@@ ds and water ."
The li@@ qu@@ id is actually that clear li@@ qu@@ id .
"If you &apos;ve ever over@@ be@@ at@@ en your whi@@ pped cre@@ am , it &apos;s actually bu@@ t@@ ter@@ mi@@ l@@ k ."
And that &apos;s what it was in the early days .
And that &apos;s what people used for b@@ aking and all sor@@ ts of things .
"Now , the bu@@ t@@ ter@@ mi@@ l@@ k that you get is actually low@@ -@@ f@@ at or skim mi@@ l@@ k ."
"I@@ M : E@@ x@@ c@@ use me , I didn &apos;t know . All right ?"
Ch@@ e@@ f : The reason he thought that is because bu@@ t@@ ter@@ mi@@ l@@ k is so wonder@@ fully thi@@ ck and deli@@ ci@@ ous .
"I@@ M : Yeah , it is , exactly ."
So who would think that it was low@@ -@@ f@@ at ?
"Well , that &apos;s it . Thank you very much ."
Ha@@ pp@@ y TED . It &apos;s so wonderful here . I love it . I love it . I love it .
Th@@ an@@ ks . By@@ e .
"K@@ ur@@ t An@@ der@@ s@@ en : Li@@ ke many archite@@ cts , Davi@@ d is a ho@@ g for the li@@ me@@ light but is su@@ f@@ fi@@ cien@@ tly re@@ ti@@ cent — or at least pre@@ ten@@ ds to be — that he asked me to question him rather than spe@@ aking ."
"In fact what we &apos;re going to talk about , I think , is in fact a sub@@ je@@ ct that is probably better ser@@ ved by a convers@@ ation than an ad@@ dre@@ ss ."
And I gu@@ ess we have a bit of news cli@@ p to pre@@ ce@@ de .
"D@@ an R@@ a@@ ther : S@@ in@@ ce the Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 1@@ th att@@ ack on the World T@@ ra@@ de C@@ enter , many people have flo@@ cked to dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n New York to see and pay re@@ spe@@ cts at what amoun@@ ts to the 1@@ 6@@ -@@ ac@@ re bu@@ ri@@ al ground ."
"Now , as C@@ B@@ S &apos;s J@@ im A@@ x@@ el@@ ro@@ d re@@ por@@ ts , they &apos;re pu@@ tting the fini@@ sh@@ ing tou@@ ch@@ es on a new way for people to visi@@ t and view the scen@@ e ."
J@@ im A@@ x@@ el@@ ro@@ d : F@@ or@@ get the E@@ m@@ pi@@ re St@@ ate Bu@@ il@@ ding or the St@@ at@@ ue of Li@@ ber@@ ty .
There &apos;s a new place in New York where the c@@ row@@ ds are thi@@ ck@@ est — G@@ round Z@@ er@@ o .
T@@ ou@@ ri@@ st : I &apos;ve taken my ste@@ p@@ -@@ d@@ aughter here from Indi@@ an@@ a@@ pol@@ is .
This was — out of all the tou@@ ri@@ st si@@ tes in New York C@@ ity — this was her num@@ ber@@ -@@ one pi@@ ck .
J@@ A : Th@@ ous@@ ands now line up on low@@ er B@@ ro@@ ad@@ way .
T@@ ou@@ ri@@ st : I &apos;ve been wan@@ ting to come down here since this happened .
J@@ A : E@@ ven on the col@@ d@@ est win@@ ter days .
To hon@@ or and remember .
"T@@ ou@@ ri@@ st : It &apos;s re@@ ality , it &apos;s us . It happened here ."
This is ours .
"J@@ A : So many , in fact , that seeing has become a bit of a problem ."
T@@ ou@@ ri@@ st : I think that people are very f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated that they &apos;re not able to get clo@@ s@@ er to see what &apos;s going on .
J@@ A : But that is about to change .
"In recor@@ d time , a team of archite@@ cts and con@@ stru@@ ction wor@@ k@@ ers desig@@ ned and built a vie@@ w@@ ing pl@@ at@@ form to e@@ ase the f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation and bring people clo@@ s@@ er ."
"M@@ an : They &apos;ll get an incredible pan@@ or@@ ama and understand , I think more completely , the sh@@ e@@ er tot@@ ality of the de@@ stru@@ ction of the place ."
"J@@ A : If you think about it , G@@ round Z@@ er@@ o is un@@ like most any other tou@@ ri@@ st site in America ."
"U@@ n@@ like the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on or the W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton M@@ on@@ um@@ ent , people come here to see what &apos;s no longer there ."
Davi@@ d Ro@@ ck@@ well : The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a con@@ stru@@ ction site but as this incredi@@ bly moving bu@@ ri@@ al ground .
"J@@ A : The wal@@ ls are b@@ are by design , so people can fi@@ ll them with their own memor@@ i@@ als the way they already have along the cur@@ r@@ ent per@@ i@@ me@@ ter ."
"T@@ ou@@ ri@@ st : F@@ ro@@ m our hear@@ ts , it af@@ fe@@ cted us just as much ."
J@@ A : The ra@@ m@@ ps are made of simple materi@@ al — the kind of pl@@ y@@ wood you see at con@@ stru@@ ction si@@ tes — which is really the whole point .
In the face of America &apos;s wor@@ st de@@ stru@@ ction people are building again .
"J@@ im A@@ x@@ el@@ ro@@ d , C@@ B@@ S N@@ ew@@ s , New York ."
"K@@ A : This is not an obvi@@ ous sub@@ je@@ ct to be in the sen@@ su@@ ality se@@ g@@ ment , but cer@@ tain@@ ly Davi@@ d you are known as — I know , a ph@@ ra@@ se you h@@ ate — an en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment archite@@ ct ."
"@@ Y@@ our work is high@@ ly sen@@ su@@ al , even he@@ d@@ oni@@ stic ."
D@@ R : I like that word .
K@@ A : It &apos;s about ple@@ as@@ ure — c@@ as@@ in@@ os and hot@@ els and re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts .
How did the sho@@ ck that all of us — and es@@ pe@@ cially all of us in New York — felt on the 1@@ 1@@ th of Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber trans@@ mu@@ te into your de@@ si@@ re to do this thing ?
"D@@ R : Well the tru@@ th of the matter is , post@@ -@@ Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 1@@ th , I felt myself in the ro@@ le ori@@ gin@@ ally — first of all as someone who lives in T@@ ri@@ be@@ ca and wh@@ ose neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od was de@@ v@@ ast@@ ated , and as someone who works less than a mi@@ le from there — that I was in the ro@@ le of for@@ cing 100 people who work with me in my fir@@ m , to contin@@ ue to have the same level of en@@ th@@ usi@@ as@@ m about cre@@ ating the places we had been cre@@ ating ."
"In fact we &apos;re fini@@ sh@@ ing a book which is called &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ as@@ ure , &quot; &quot; which is about sen@@ su@@ al ple@@ as@@ ure in sp@@ ac@@ es ."
But I &apos;ve got to tell you — it became im@@ possible to do that .
We were really par@@ al@@ y@@ zed .
And I found myself the F@@ ri@@ day after Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 1@@ th — two days af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds — liter@@ ally u@@ na@@ ble to moti@@ v@@ ate any@@ one to do anything .
We gave the offi@@ ce a few days off .
"And in di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing this with other archite@@ cts , we had seen people saying in the pre@@ ss that they should re@@ build the tow@@ ers as they were — they should re@@ build them 50 stories tal@@ ler ."
"And I thought it was ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing to spe@@ cul@@ ate , as if this were a compe@@ ti@@ tion , on something that was such a fre@@ sh w@@ ound ."
"And I had a ser@@ ies of di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions — first with Ri@@ ck S@@ co@@ fi@@ di@@ o and Li@@ z D@@ il@@ ler , who col@@ labor@@ ated with us on this , and se@@ ver@@ al other people — and really felt like we had to find rele@@ v@@ ance in doing something ."
"And that as people who create places , the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate way to help wasn &apos;t to pon@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate or to make up scen@@ ari@@ os , but to help right now ."
"So we tr@@ ied to come up with a way , as a group , to have a kind of design S@@ W@@ A@@ T team ."
And that was the mis@@ sion that we came up with .
K@@ A : W@@ ere you con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous of sud@@ den@@ ly — as a desig@@ ner wh@@ ose work is all about fu@@ l@@ fil@@ ling wan@@ ts — sud@@ den@@ ly fu@@ l@@ fil@@ ling needs ?
"D@@ R : Well what I was aw@@ are of was , there was this over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming need to act now ."
And we were asked to parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in a few proje@@ cts before this .
"There was a school , P@@ S 2@@ 3@@ 4 , that had been ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated down at G@@ round Z@@ er@@ o ."
They mo@@ ved to an ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed school .
"We took about 20 or 30 archite@@ cts and desig@@ n@@ ers and arti@@ sts , and over four days — it was like this urb@@ an bar@@ n@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ing — to ren@@ o@@ v@@ ate it , and everyone wanted to help ."
It was just ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary .
"T@@ om O@@ t@@ ter@@ ness con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted , Ma@@ ir@@ a K@@ al@@ man con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted and it became this ca@@ th@@ arti@@ c experience for us ."
"K@@ A : And that was done , effe@@ cti@@ vely , by O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 8 or something ?"
D@@ R : Yeah .
"K@@ A : O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , what you fac@@ ed in trying to do something as sub@@ stan@@ tial as this project — and this is only one of four that you &apos;ve desig@@ ned to sur@@ round the site — you must have run up against the incredi@@ bly by@@ z@@ an@@ t@@ ine , en@@ tr@@ en@@ ched bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ rac@@ y and pow@@ ers that be in New York real est@@ ate and New York poli@@ ti@@ cs ."
"D@@ R : Well , it &apos;s a fun@@ ny thing ."
"We fini@@ shed P@@ S 2@@ 3@@ 4 , and had din@@ ner with a small group ."
I was actually asked to be a com@@ mi@@ t@@ te@@ e cha@@ ir on an A@@ I@@ A com@@ mi@@ t@@ te@@ e to re@@ build .
And I s@@ at in on se@@ ver@@ al me@@ et@@ ings .
And there were the most cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ous gr@@ and pl@@ ans that had to do with lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m in@@ fra@@ structure and re@@ building the entire city .
"And the fact is that there were im@@ medi@@ ate w@@ oun@@ ds and needs that needed to be fil@@ led , and there was talk about inclu@@ sion and wan@@ ting it to be an inclu@@ sive process ."
And it wasn &apos;t an inclu@@ sive group .
"So we said , what is — K@@ A : It was not an inclu@@ sive group ?"
D@@ R : It was not an inclu@@ sive group .
"It was pre@@ dom@@ in@@ an@@ tly a white , ri@@ ch , cor@@ por@@ ate group that was not re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative of the city ."
K@@ A : S@@ ho@@ c@@ king .
"D@@ R : Yeah , sur@@ pri@@ sing ."
So Ri@@ ck and Li@@ z and K@@ ev@@ in and I came up with the idea .
The city actually appro@@ ach@@ ed us .
We first appro@@ ach@@ ed the city about P@@ ier 9@@ 4 .
We saw how P@@ S 2@@ 3@@ 4 worked .
The fam@@ il@@ ies — the vi@@ cti@@ ms of the fam@@ il@@ ies — were going to this pie@@ r that was incredi@@ bly de@@ hum@@ ani@@ z@@ ing .
K@@ A : O@@ n the H@@ ud@@ son Ri@@ ver ?
"D@@ R : Yeah . And the city actually — through T@@ im Z@@ ag@@ at ini@@ ti@@ ally , and then through Ch@@ ri@@ sty@@ ne Ni@@ ch@@ ol@@ as , then we got to G@@ i@@ uli@@ ani — said , &quot; &quot; You know we don &apos;t want to do anything with P@@ ier 9@@ 4 right now , but we have an obser@@ vation pl@@ at@@ form for the fam@@ il@@ ies down at G@@ round Z@@ er@@ o that we &apos;d like to be a more di@@ gni@@ f@@ ied experience for the fam@@ il@@ ies , and a way to prote@@ ct it from the we@@ a@@ ther . &quot; &quot; So I went down there with Ri@@ ck and Li@@ z and K@@ ev@@ in , and I &apos;ve got to say , it was the most moving experience of my life ."
"It was de@@ v@@ ast@@ ating to see the simple pl@@ y@@ wood pl@@ at@@ form with a ra@@ il around it , where the fam@@ il@@ ies of the vi@@ cti@@ ms had left not@@ es to them ."
And there was no medi@@ ation between us and the experience .
There was no fil@@ ter .
"And I re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed on Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 1@@ th , on 1@@ 4@@ th St@@ re@@ et , the ro@@ of of our building — we can see the World T@@ ra@@ de T@@ ow@@ ers pro@@ min@@ ently — and I saw the first building col@@ lap@@ se from a con@@ fer@@ ence room on the e@@ igh@@ th flo@@ or on a T@@ V that we had set up ."
"And then everyone was up on the ro@@ of , so I ran up there ."
And it was amazing how much har@@ der it was to believe in real life than it was on T@@ V .
There was something about the comfor@@ t of the fil@@ ter and how much information was between us and the experience .
"So seeing this in a very simple , di@@ gni@@ f@@ ied way was a very powerful experience ."
"So we went back to the city and said we &apos;re not parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly interested in the up@@ gra@@ de of this as a V@@ I@@ P pl@@ at@@ form , but we &apos;ve spent some time down there ."
A@@ t the same time the city had this need .
"They were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thous@@ and people a day who were going down there , that had now@@ here to go ."
And there was no way to deal with the traf@@ fic around the site .
So de@@ al@@ ing with it is just an im@@ medi@@ ate ma@@ ster pl@@ an .
There was a way — there had to be a way — to get people to move around the site .
K@@ A : But then you &apos;ve got to figure out a way — we will sk@@ i@@ p over the in@@ s@@ an@@ ely te@@ di@@ ous process of getting per@@ mi@@ ts and getting everybody on bo@@ ard — but simply fun@@ ding this thing .
"It looks like a fa@@ ir@@ ly simple thing , but this was a half a million dol@@ lar project ?"
"D@@ R : Well , we knew that if it wasn &apos;t pri@@ v@@ ately fun@@ ded , it wasn &apos;t going to happen ."
"And we also , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , knew that if it didn &apos;t happen by the end of the G@@ i@@ uli@@ ani ad@@ min@@ ist@@ r@@ ation , then everyone who we were de@@ al@@ ing with at the D@@ O@@ T and the Po@@ li@@ ce De@@ part@@ ment and all of the — we were me@@ e@@ ting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time , and it was set up by the O@@ f@@ fi@@ ce of E@@ mer@@ gen@@ cy M@@ an@@ ag@@ ement ."
"This incredible act on their part , because they really wanted this , and they sen@@ sed that this needed to happen ."
"K@@ A : And there was ther@@ e@@ fore this ti@@ c@@ king clo@@ ck , because G@@ i@@ uli@@ ani was obvi@@ ously out three months after that ."
"D@@ R : Yeah . So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this — we had to work with the fam@@ il@@ ies of the vi@@ cti@@ ms , through the city , to make sure that they knew this was happening ."
Because this didn &apos;t want to be a sur@@ pri@@ se .
"And we also had to be as under the ra@@ d@@ ar scre@@ en as we could be in New York , because the key was not ra@@ is@@ ing a lot of obje@@ ction and sort of working as qu@@ ie@@ tly as possible ."
"We came up with the idea of se@@ tting up a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation , ma@@ in@@ ly because when we found a con@@ trac@@ tor who would build this , he would not ag@@ ree to do this , even if we would pay him the money ."
There needed to be a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation in place .
"So we came up with a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation , and actually what happened was one major develo@@ per in New York — K@@ A : Wh@@ o sh@@ all re@@ ma@@ in na@@ me@@ less , I gu@@ ess ?"
"D@@ R : Yeah . H@@ is ini@@ ti@@ als are J@@ S , and he ow@@ ns R@@ oc@@ ke@@ fel@@ ler C@@ enter , if that hel@@ ps any@@ one — vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed to help ."
And we met with him .
"The pri@@ ces from the con@@ trac@@ t@@ ors were between five to 7@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars ."
"And At@@ lan@@ ti@@ c@@ -@@ H@@ ey@@ d@@ t , who &apos;s the largest s@@ ca@@ f@@ fol@@ ding con@@ trac@@ tor in the country , vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed to do it at cost ."
"So this develo@@ per said , &quot; &quot; You know what , we &apos;ll under@@ write the entire ex@@ pen@@ se . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s incredible ! &quot; &quot; And I think this was the 2@@ 1@@ st , and we knew this had to be built and up by the 2@@ 8@@ th ."
And we had to start con@@ stru@@ ction the next day .
"We had a me@@ e@@ ting that ev@@ ening with his con@@ trac@@ tor of cho@@ ice , and the con@@ trac@@ tor show@@ ed up with the d@@ raw@@ ings of the pl@@ at@@ form about half the size that we had d@@ raw@@ n it ."
"K@@ A : S@@ or@@ t of like the S@@ p@@ in@@ al T@@ a@@ p scen@@ e where you get the t@@ iny little St@@ one@@ h@@ en@@ ge , I gu@@ ess ?"
"( Laughter ) D@@ R : In fact , it was as if this was going to be win@@ dow@@ -@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing s@@ ca@@ f@@ fol@@ ding ."
"There was no sense of the fact that this is next to S@@ a@@ int P@@ au@@ l — that this is really a place that needs to be kind of di@@ gni@@ f@@ ied , and a place to ref@@ le@@ ct and remember ."
"And I &apos;ve got to say that we spent a lot of time in pu@@ tting this together , wat@@ ching the c@@ row@@ ds that ga@@ ther@@ ed at S@@ a@@ int P@@ au@@ l — which is just to the right — and moving around the site ."
"And I live down there , so we spent a lot of time looking at the need ."
"And I think people were amaz@@ ed at two things — I think they were amaz@@ ed at the de@@ stru@@ ction , but I think there was a sense of dis@@ belie@@ f about the her@@ o@@ i@@ cs of New Y@@ or@@ k@@ ers that I found very moving ."
J@@ ust the sort of every@@ day her@@ o@@ i@@ cs of New Y@@ or@@ k@@ ers .
"So we were in this me@@ e@@ ting and the con@@ trac@@ tor liter@@ ally said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to lo@@ ck the door , because this develo@@ per will not ag@@ ree to have you leave ti@@ ll you &apos;ve sig@@ ned off on this . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is half the size , it doesn &apos;t have any of the design fe@@ at@@ ures that have been ag@@ re@@ ed upo@@ n by everyone — everyone in the city ."
We &apos;d have to go back to the beginning to do this . &quot; &quot; And I con@@ v@@ in@@ ced him that we should leave the room with the ag@@ re@@ ement to build it as desig@@ ned .
The next day I got an e@@ ma@@ il from the develo@@ per saying that he was with@@ d@@ raw@@ ing all fun@@ ding .
"So we didn &apos;t know what to do , but we decided to c@@ ast a very wi@@ de net ."
We e@@ ma@@ i@@ led out let@@ ters to as many people as we could — se@@ ver@@ al people in the audience here — who were very hel@@ p@@ ful .
K@@ A : There was no thought of ab@@ and@@ on@@ ing ship at that point ?
D@@ R : No . In fact I told the con@@ trac@@ tor to go a@@ head .
He had already or@@ der@@ ed materi@@ als based on my go@@ -@@ a@@ head .
We knew that one way or another this was going to happen .
And we just felt it had to happen .
K@@ A : You were fun@@ ding it yourself and with con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions and this f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation .
"R@@ i@@ ch@@ ard , I think very cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ly , made the point at the beginning — before all the cha@@ ir desig@@ n@@ ers came out — about the history of cha@@ ir desig@@ n@@ ers im@@ pos@@ ing a@@ es@@ the@@ tic solu@@ tions on this kind of uni@@ vers@@ al , ban@@ al , common problem of sitting ."
"It seem@@ s to me with this , that it was the op@@ posi@@ te of that ."
"This was an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted , sin@@ gu@@ lar design problem ."
"D@@ R : Well here &apos;s the issue : we knew that this was not in the sense of — we think about the site , and think about the need for a memor@@ i@@ al ."
It was important that this not be c@@ ate@@ g@@ ori@@ zed as a memor@@ i@@ al .
"That this was a place for people to ref@@ le@@ ct , to remember — a kind of qu@@ ie@@ t place ."
So it led us to using design solu@@ tions that created as few fil@@ ters between the vie@@ wer — as we said about the fam@@ il@@ ies &apos; pl@@ at@@ form — and the experience as possible .
It &apos;s all incredi@@ bly hum@@ ble materi@@ al .
It &apos;s s@@ ca@@ f@@ fol@@ ding and pl@@ y@@ wood .
"And it allow@@ s — by sort of the pro@@ ces@@ sion of the movement , up by S@@ a@@ int P@@ au@@ l &apos;s and down the other side — it gi@@ ves you about 3@@ 00 fe@@ et to go up 1@@ 3 fe@@ et from the ground to where you get the 3@@ 60 de@@ gre@@ e view ."
"But the design was dri@@ ven by a need to be qui@@ ck , che@@ a@@ p , sa@@ fe , re@@ spe@@ ct@@ ful , f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble ."
One of the other things is this is desig@@ ned to be mo@@ ve@@ able .
"Because when we looked at the four pl@@ at@@ form@@ s around the site , one of which is an up@@ gra@@ de of the fam@@ il@@ ies &apos; pl@@ at@@ form , we knew that these had to be mo@@ ve@@ able to re@@ spo@@ nd to chang@@ ing con@@ di@@ tions , and the chang@@ ing defini@@ tion of what G@@ round Z@@ er@@ o is ."
"K@@ A : Y@@ our work — I mean , we &apos;ve tal@@ ked about this before — a lot of your work , I think , is inform@@ ed by your belie@@ f in , or your fo@@ cus on the tem@@ por@@ ar@@ iness of all things and the ev@@ an@@ es@@ cen@@ ce of things , and a kind of &quot; &quot; E@@ at , d@@ r@@ in@@ k , and be mer@@ ry , for tom@@ or@@ row we die , &quot; &quot; sort of sense of ex@@ ist@@ ence ."
This is c@@ lear@@ ly not a work for the ages .
"You know , a couple of years this thing isn &apos;t going to be here ."
"D@@ id that requi@@ re , as an archite@@ ct , a new way of thinking about what you were doing ?"
To think of it as this pu@@ re@@ ly tem@@ por@@ ary in@@ stal@@ l@@ ation ?
"D@@ R : No , I don &apos;t think so ."
"I think this is , obvi@@ ously , sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally different from anything we &apos;d ever thought about doing before , just by the nature of it ."
"W@@ here it over@@ la@@ ps with thou@@ ghts about our work in gener@@ al is , number one — the noti@@ on of col@@ labor@@ ation as a sort of way to get things done ."
"And K@@ ev@@ in Ken@@ n@@ on , Ri@@ ck S@@ co@@ fi@@ di@@ o , Li@@ z D@@ il@@ ler and all the people within the city — Nor@@ man Le@@ ar , who I spo@@ ke to four hours before our de@@ ad@@ line for fun@@ ding , of@@ fer@@ ed to give us a bri@@ dge lo@@ an to help us get through it ."
So the noti@@ on of col@@ labor@@ ation — I think this re@@ in@@ for@@ ces how important that is .
"And in terms of the tem@@ por@@ ary nature of it , our go@@ al was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be ."
"I think what we were most interested in was pro@@ mot@@ ing a kind of di@@ al@@ og@@ ue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city , about what &apos;s really happening there ."
"And a day or two before it open@@ ed was G@@ i@@ uli@@ ani &apos;s f@@ are@@ well ad@@ dre@@ ss , where he pro@@ posed the idea of all of G@@ round Z@@ er@@ o being a memor@@ i@@ al ."
"Wh@@ ich was very contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al , but it re@@ son@@ ated with a lot of people ."
"And I think re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of what the posi@@ tion is about how this s@@ ac@@ red piece of land is to be used , having it come out of actually seeing it in a real en@@ coun@@ ter , I think makes it a more powerful di@@ al@@ og@@ ue ."
And that &apos;s what we were interested in .
"So that , very much , is in the re@@ al@@ m of things I &apos;ve been interested in before ."
"K@@ A : It seem@@ s to me , am@@ ong other things , a lo@@ vely piece of ci@@ vi@@ c in@@ fra@@ structure ."
It en@@ ab@@ les that convers@@ ation to get seri@@ ous .
"And six months after the fact — and only a few months away from the site being cle@@ an@@ ed — we are very quickly , now , getting to the point where those convers@@ ations about what should go there are getting seri@@ ous ."
Do you have — having been as physi@@ cally inv@@ olved in the site as you have been doing this project — have any ideas about what should or sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be done ?
"D@@ R : Well , I think one thing that sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be done is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate — I think right now the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion is a very clo@@ sed di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion on the ma@@ ster pl@@ an ."
"The Pro@@ te@@ t@@ ch G@@ al@@ l@@ ery re@@ cent@@ ly had a show on ideas for buil@@ dings , which had some sort of inv@@ enti@@ ve ideas of buil@@ dings ."
K@@ A : But it had some really terri@@ ble ideas .
"D@@ R : And it also felt a little bit like a kind of compe@@ ti@@ tion of ideas , where I think the fo@@ cus of ideas should be on ma@@ ster plan@@ ning and uses ."
"And I think there should be a bro@@ a@@ der — which there &apos;s star@@ ting to be — the di@@ al@@ og@@ ue is really open@@ ing up to , what does this site really want to be ?"
"And I tru@@ ly believe until the issue of memor@@ i@@ al is sor@@ ted out , that it &apos;s going to be very hard to have an inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
"There &apos;s a few di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions right now that I think are very posi@@ tive , about de@@ pres@@ sing the W@@ est S@@ i@@ de H@@ igh@@ way and conne@@ cting this over , so that there &apos;s one un@@ inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted piece of land ."
"K@@ A : Well , I think that &apos;s interesting ."
"And it gets to another issue that was probably in@@ appro@@ pri@@ ate to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s six months ago , but per@@ haps isn &apos;t now , which is , not many of us love the World T@@ ra@@ de C@@ enter as a piece of archite@@ cture , as what it had done to this city and that huge pla@@ za ."
"I@@ s this an opportunity , is the sil@@ ver lin@@ ing — a sil@@ ver lin@@ ing , here — to re@@ build some more tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal city g@@ ri@@ d , or not ?"
D@@ R : I think there &apos;s a real opportunity to eng@@ age in a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion of why we live in cities .
And why do we live in places where such dis@@ si@@ mi@@ lar people col@@ li@@ de up against us each day ?
"I don &apos;t think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thous@@ and new offi@@ ce sp@@ ac@@ es , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of what the number is ."
"So ye@@ ah , I think there is a ch@@ ance to re@@ -@@ look at how we think about cities ."
"And in fact , there &apos;s a pro@@ pos@@ al on the table now for building number seven ."
K@@ A : Wh@@ ich was the building just nor@@ th of the T@@ ow@@ ers ?
"D@@ R : R@@ ight , which the tow@@ ers fe@@ ll into ."
And the reason that &apos;s been he@@ ld up is essen@@ ti@@ ally by community ou@@ tra@@ ge that they &apos;re not re@@ -@@ open@@ ing the stre@@ et to conne@@ ct that back to the rest of the city .
"I think a public di@@ al@@ og@@ ue — I think , you know , I &apos;d like to see an inter@@ national compe@@ ti@@ tion , and a call for ideas for uses ."
"K@@ A : W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s ar@@ ts , whether it &apos;s h@@ ous@@ ing , whether it &apos;s what amount of sh@@ op@@ ping ?"
D@@ R : R@@ ight . And we &apos;re looking for other things .
This small f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation we put together is looking for other ways to help .
In@@ clu@@ ding taking a small piece ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent to the site and in@@ vi@@ ting 10 archite@@ cts who cur@@ r@@ ently don &apos;t have a vo@@ ice in New York to do arti@@ st h@@ ous@@ ing .
"And find other ways to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion to be against sort of mon@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic , single solu@@ tions , and more about a mul@@ ti@@ pli@@ city of things ."
"K@@ A : Be@@ fore we end , I know you have a piece of di@@ gi@@ tal video of the experience of being on this pl@@ at@@ form ?"
"D@@ R : Joh@@ n K@@ am@@ en — who &apos;s here , actually — put together a two and a half minu@@ te piece that shows the pl@@ at@@ form in use ."
So I thought that would be good to end with .
"D@@ R : We &apos;re looking from F@@ ul@@ ton St@@ re@@ et , w@@ est ."
One of the tri@@ ck@@ y issu@@ es we had with the G@@ i@@ uli@@ ani ad@@ min@@ ist@@ r@@ ation was I had for@@ got@@ ten how anti@@ -@@ gra@@ f@@ fi@@ t@@ i he was .
And essen@@ ti@@ ally our structure was desig@@ ned to be wri@@ t@@ ten on .
"K@@ A : A@@ s you say , it &apos;s not a memor@@ i@@ al ."
But were you con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous of memor@@ i@@ als ? The V@@ ie@@ t@@ nam Me@@ mor@@ i@@ al ?
Th@@ ose kinds of form@@ s ?
"D@@ R : We cer@@ tain@@ ly did as much research as we could , and we were con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous of other memor@@ i@@ als ."
And also the comple@@ x@@ ity and len@@ g@@ th of time they really take to do .
"It &apos;s 3@@ 50 people on the com@@ mi@@ t@@ te@@ e for O@@ k@@ la@@ hom@@ a C@@ ity , which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad@@ -@@ ho@@ c , spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous solution that ex@@ pan@@ ded on Uni@@ on S@@ qu@@ are and the places that were ad@@ -@@ ho@@ c memor@@ i@@ als in the city already ."
The s@@ ca@@ f@@ fol@@ ding you can see built up over the stre@@ et is de@@ -@@ m@@ oun@@ table .
"What &apos;s interesting now is the nature of the site has tot@@ ally changed , so that what you &apos;re aw@@ are of is not just the de@@ stru@@ ction of the buil@@ dings in G@@ round Z@@ er@@ o , but all of the buil@@ dings around it — and the sc@@ ars on the building around it , which are en@@ or@@ m@@ ous ."
This shows S@@ a@@ int P@@ au@@ l &apos;s on the left .
K@@ A : I just want to th@@ ank you on be@@ half of New Y@@ or@@ k@@ ers for making this happen and getting this done .
"But the kind of vi@@ r@@ tually in@@ stan@@ tan@@ e@@ ous nature of its er@@ e@@ ction , and its being there , almost before you could believe that a respon@@ se of this mag@@ ni@@ tu@@ de could be ac@@ comp@@ li@@ shed , is part of its ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary — I don &apos;t know if beau@@ ty is the word — but pre@@ sen@@ ce ."
D@@ R : It was an hon@@ or to do .
And we were th@@ ri@@ l@@ led to be able to show it here .
"E@@ very@@ thing is co@@ vered in in@@ visi@@ ble e@@ co@@ systems made of t@@ iny li@@ fe@@ form@@ s : bac@@ ter@@ ia , vi@@ rus@@ es and fun@@ gi ."
"O@@ ur des@@ ks , our compu@@ ters , our pen@@ ci@@ ls , our buil@@ dings all har@@ b@@ or resi@@ dent mi@@ c@@ robi@@ al land@@ s@@ cap@@ es ."
"As we design these things , we could be thinking about desig@@ ning these in@@ visi@@ ble wor@@ l@@ ds , and also thinking about how they inter@@ act with our per@@ s@@ onal e@@ co@@ systems ."
"O@@ ur bod@@ ies are home to tri@@ llions of micro@@ be@@ s , and these cre@@ at@@ ures def@@ ine who we are ."
The micro@@ be@@ s in your gu@@ t can in@@ flu@@ ence your we@@ ight and your mo@@ ods .
The micro@@ be@@ s on your sk@@ in can help boo@@ st your im@@ mu@@ ne system .
"The micro@@ be@@ s in your m@@ outh can fre@@ sh@@ en your bre@@ ath , or not , and the key thing is that our per@@ s@@ onal e@@ co@@ systems inter@@ act with e@@ co@@ systems on everything we tou@@ ch ."
"So , for example , when you tou@@ ch a pen@@ ci@@ l , mi@@ c@@ robi@@ al ex@@ change happens ."
"If we can design the in@@ visi@@ ble e@@ co@@ systems in our sur@@ ro@@ un@@ dings , this open@@ s a pat@@ h to in@@ flu@@ en@@ cing our health in un@@ pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted ways ."
"I get asked all of the time from people , &quot; Is it possible to really design mi@@ c@@ robi@@ al e@@ co@@ systems ? &quot;"
And I believe the answer is y@@ es .
"I think we &apos;re doing it right now , but we &apos;re doing it un@@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously ."
"I &apos;m going to share data with you from one aspe@@ ct of my research fo@@ c@@ used on archite@@ cture that de@@ mon@@ str@@ ates how , through both con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous and un@@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous design , we &apos;re impac@@ ting these in@@ visi@@ ble wor@@ l@@ ds ."
"This is the L@@ il@@ l@@ is B@@ us@@ iness C@@ om@@ ple@@ x at the Uni@@ versity of O@@ re@@ g@@ on , and I worked with a team of archite@@ cts and biologi@@ sts to sam@@ ple over 3@@ 00 ro@@ oms in this building ."
"We wanted to get something like a f@@ os@@ si@@ l recor@@ d of the building , and to do this , we sam@@ p@@ led d@@ ust ."
"F@@ ro@@ m the d@@ ust , we pul@@ led out bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al cells , bro@@ ke them open , and com@@ par@@ ed their gen@@ e sequ@@ ences ."
This means that people in my group were doing a lot of vac@@ u@@ um@@ ing during this project .
"This is a picture of T@@ im , who , right when I s@@ na@@ pped this picture , re@@ min@@ ded me , he said , &quot; &quot; J@@ es@@ si@@ ca , the last la@@ b group I worked in I was doing fie@@ l@@ d@@ work in the C@@ ost@@ a Ri@@ can ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st , and things have changed dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally for me . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;m going to show you now first what we found in the offi@@ ces , and we &apos;re going to look at the data through a vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ ation to@@ ol that I &apos;ve been working on in part@@ ner@@ ship with Au@@ tod@@ es@@ k ."
"The way that you look at this data is , first , look around the outside of the cir@@ cle ."
"You &apos;ll see bro@@ ad bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al grou@@ ps , and if you look at the sha@@ pe of this p@@ in@@ k lo@@ be , it tel@@ ls you something about the rel@@ ative ab@@ un@@ dance of each group ."
"So at 12 o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck , you &apos;ll see that offi@@ ces have a lot of al@@ p@@ ha@@ prote@@ ob@@ ac@@ ter@@ ia , and at one o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck you &apos;ll see that bac@@ il@@ li are relati@@ vely r@@ are ."
Let &apos;s take a look at what &apos;s going on in different space typ@@ es in this building .
"If you look inside the re@@ stro@@ oms , they all have really si@@ mi@@ lar e@@ co@@ systems , and if you were to look inside the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , those also have si@@ mi@@ lar e@@ co@@ systems ."
"But if you look across these space typ@@ es , you can see that they &apos;re fundam@@ ent@@ ally different from one another ."
I like to think of ba@@ th@@ ro@@ oms like a tro@@ pi@@ cal ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st .
"I told T@@ im , &quot; &quot; If you could just see the micro@@ be@@ s , it &apos;s kind of like being in C@@ ost@@ a Ri@@ ca . K@@ ind of . &quot; &quot; And I also like to think of offi@@ ces as being a temper@@ ate gra@@ s@@ s@@ land ."
"This perspe@@ ctive is a really powerful one for desig@@ n@@ ers , because you can bring on prin@@ ci@@ ples of e@@ co@@ logy , and a really important prin@@ ci@@ ple of e@@ co@@ logy is disp@@ er@@ s@@ al , the way organi@@ s@@ ms move around ."
We know that micro@@ be@@ s are disp@@ er@@ sed around by people and by air .
So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system .
"M@@ ech@@ ani@@ cal engine@@ ers design air hand@@ ling uni@@ ts to make sure that people are comfor@@ table , that the air f@@ low and temper@@ ature is just right ."
"They do this using prin@@ ci@@ ples of physi@@ cs and chemi@@ stry , but they could also be using bio@@ logy ."
"If you look at the micro@@ be@@ s in one of the air hand@@ ling uni@@ ts in this building , you &apos;ll see that they &apos;re all very si@@ mi@@ lar to one another ."
"And if you comp@@ are this to the micro@@ be@@ s in a different air hand@@ ling uni@@ t , you &apos;ll see that they &apos;re fundam@@ ent@@ ally different ."
"The ro@@ oms in this building are like is@@ l@@ ands in an archi@@ pe@@ la@@ go , and what that means is that mechani@@ cal engine@@ ers are like e@@ co@@ -@@ engine@@ ers , and they have the ability to structure bi@@ om@@ es in this building the way that they want to ."
"A@@ no@@ ther fac@@ et of how micro@@ be@@ s get around is by people , and desig@@ n@@ ers often clu@@ ster ro@@ oms together to fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ate inter@@ ac@@ tions am@@ ong people , or the sh@@ aring of ideas , like in lab@@ s and in offi@@ ces ."
"G@@ i@@ ven that micro@@ be@@ s tra@@ vel around with people , you might expe@@ ct to see ro@@ oms that are close together have really si@@ mi@@ lar bi@@ om@@ es ."
And that is exactly what we found .
"If you look at clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms right ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent to one another , they have very si@@ mi@@ lar e@@ co@@ systems , but if you go to an offi@@ ce that is a far@@ ther wal@@ king di@@ stance away , the e@@ co@@ system is fundam@@ ent@@ ally different ."
"And when I see the power that disp@@ er@@ s@@ al has on these bi@@ og@@ e@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c pat@@ ter@@ ns , it makes me think that it &apos;s possible to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le really challen@@ g@@ ing problems , like ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ -@@ ac@@ qui@@ red in@@ fe@@ ctions ."
"I believe this has got to be , in part , a building e@@ co@@ logy problem ."
"A@@ ll right , I &apos;m going to tell you one more story about this building ."
I am col@@ labor@@ ating with Ch@@ ar@@ lie B@@ row@@ n .
"He &apos;s an archite@@ ct , and Ch@@ ar@@ lie is de@@ e@@ ply con@@ cer@@ ned about global clim@@ ate change ."
He &apos;s de@@ di@@ c@@ ated his life to susta@@ in@@ able design .
"When he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a qu@@ anti@@ t@@ ative way how his design cho@@ i@@ ces impac@@ ted the e@@ co@@ logy and bio@@ logy of this building , he got really exci@@ ted , because it ad@@ ded a new di@@ men@@ sion to what he did ."
He went from thinking just about energy to also star@@ ting to think about human health .
He hel@@ ped design some of the air hand@@ ling systems in this building and the way it was v@@ enti@@ lated .
So what I &apos;m first going to show you is air that we sam@@ p@@ led outside of the building .
"What you &apos;re looking at is a sig@@ nature of bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al communi@@ ties in the out@@ door air , and how they v@@ ary over time ."
N@@ ex@@ t I &apos;m going to show you what happened when we experim@@ ent@@ ally m@@ ani@@ pu@@ lated clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms .
We blo@@ cked them off at night so that they got no v@@ enti@@ l@@ ation .
"A lot of buil@@ dings are oper@@ ated this way , probably where you work , and comp@@ an@@ ies do this to sa@@ ve money on their energy bi@@ ll ."
"What we found is that these ro@@ oms re@@ ma@@ ined relati@@ vely st@@ ag@@ n@@ ant until S@@ atur@@ day , when we open@@ ed the v@@ ents up again ."
"When you wal@@ ked into those ro@@ oms , they s@@ me@@ l@@ led really bad , and our data su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that it had something to do with lea@@ ving behind the air@@ bor@@ ne bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al s@@ ou@@ p from people the day before ."
Con@@ tra@@ st this to ro@@ oms that were desig@@ ned using a susta@@ in@@ able pas@@ sive design strate@@ gy where air came in from the outside through l@@ ou@@ ver@@ s .
"In these ro@@ oms , the air trac@@ ked the out@@ door air relati@@ vely well , and when Ch@@ ar@@ lie saw this , he got really exci@@ ted ."
He felt like he had made a good cho@@ ice with the design process because it was both energy ef@@ fi@@ cient and it wa@@ shed away the building &apos;s resi@@ dent mi@@ c@@ robi@@ al land@@ s@@ cape .
"The exam@@ ples that I just gave you are about archite@@ cture , but they &apos;re rele@@ v@@ ant to the design of anything ."
I@@ mag@@ ine desig@@ ning with the kinds of micro@@ be@@ s that we want in a pl@@ ane or on a phone .
"There &apos;s a new micro@@ be , I just disco@@ vered it ."
"It &apos;s called B@@ L@@ I@@ S , and it &apos;s been sh@@ own to both ward off pa@@ th@@ og@@ ens and give you good bre@@ ath ."
W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be aw@@ es@@ ome if we all had B@@ L@@ I@@ S on our ph@@ ones ?
"A con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous appro@@ ach to design , I &apos;m cal@@ ling it bio@@ inform@@ ed design , and I think it &apos;s possible ."
Thank you .

In@@ te@@ lli@@ g@@ ence — what is it ?
Let &apos;s take a ste@@ p back .
And you obser@@ ve a really str@@ ange effe@@ ct .
We &apos;re trying to pre@@ v@@ ent an impac@@ t .
Is there a single equ@@ ation for inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence ?
"In shor@@ t , inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence doesn &apos;t like to get tra@@ pped ."
How pre@@ di@@ ctive is it ?
D@@ o@@ es it pre@@ di@@ ct hum@@ an@@ -@@ level inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence ?
Here are some exam@@ ples of En@@ tro@@ pi@@ ca in action .
It simply decided on its own to bal@@ ance the po@@ le .
"Now , there &apos;s a pro@@ found i@@ ro@@ ny here ."
The mach@@ ines would ri@@ se up against us .
A@@ no@@ ther important con@@ sequ@@ ence is go@@ al see@@ king .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to start by as@@ king you a question : Is any@@ one fami@@ li@@ ar with the blue al@@ ga@@ e problem ?
"O@@ kay , so most of you are ."
I think we can all ag@@ ree it &apos;s a seri@@ ous issue .
"N@@ ob@@ ody wan@@ ts to d@@ r@@ in@@ k blue al@@ ga@@ e-@@ cont@@ am@@ in@@ ated water , or s@@ wi@@ m in a blue al@@ ga@@ e-@@ in@@ fe@@ st@@ ed l@@ ake ."
R@@ ight ?
"I hope you won &apos;t be disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ted , but today , I won &apos;t be talking about blue al@@ ga@@ e ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I &apos;ll be talking about the ma@@ in cause at the ro@@ ot of this issue , which I will be re@@ fer@@ ring to as the ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us cri@@ sis ."
Why have I cho@@ s@@ en to talk to you about the ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us cri@@ sis today ?
F@@ or the simple reason that no@@ body else is talking about it .
"And by the end of my pres@@ ent@@ ation , I hope that the gener@@ al public will be more aw@@ are of this cri@@ sis and this issue ."
"Now , the problem is that if I ask , why do we find ourselves in this situ@@ ation with blue al@@ ga@@ e ?"
The answer is that it comes from how we far@@ m .
"We use fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers in our far@@ ming , chemi@@ cal fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers ."
Why do we use chemi@@ cal fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers in agri@@ culture ?
"B@@ a@@ si@@ cally , to help plan@@ ts gro@@ w and to produ@@ ce a better y@@ ie@@ ld ."
The issue is that this is set to en@@ gen@@ der an environ@@ ment@@ al problem that is without pre@@ ce@@ dent .
"Be@@ fore going f@@ ur@@ ther , let me give you a c@@ ra@@ sh course in pl@@ ant bio@@ logy ."
"So , what does a pl@@ ant need in order to gro@@ w ?"
"A pl@@ ant , quite simply , needs light , it needs C@@ O@@ 2 , but even more import@@ an@@ tly , it needs nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ ts , which it d@@ raw@@ s from the so@@ il ."
"S@@ e@@ ver@@ al of these nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ ts are essen@@ tial chemi@@ cal ele@@ ments : ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us , ni@@ tro@@ g@@ en and cal@@ ci@@ um ."
"So , the pl@@ ant ’ s ro@@ ots will ex@@ trac@@ t these re@@ sources ."
T@@ od@@ ay I &apos;ll be fo@@ c@@ using on a major problem that is lin@@ ked to ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us .
Why ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us in particular ?
Because it is the most proble@@ m@@ atic chemi@@ cal ele@@ ment .
"B@@ y the end of my pres@@ ent@@ ation , you will have seen what these problems are , and where we are today ."
P@@ ho@@ sp@@ hor@@ us is a chemi@@ cal ele@@ ment that is essen@@ tial to life . This is a very important point .
I ’ d like everyone to understand pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly what the ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us issue is .
"P@@ ho@@ sp@@ hor@@ us is a key com@@ pon@@ ent in se@@ ver@@ al mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les , in many of our mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les of life ."
"E@@ x@@ per@@ ts in the fie@@ ld will know that cel@@ lu@@ lar communi@@ cation is ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us@@ -@@ based — ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ y@@ l@@ ation , de@@ ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ y@@ l@@ ation ."
C@@ ell mem@@ bran@@ es are ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us@@ -@@ based : These are called ph@@ o@@ sp@@ ho@@ li@@ pi@@ ds .
"The energy in all living things , A@@ T@@ P , is ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us@@ -@@ based ."
"And more import@@ an@@ tly still , ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us is a key com@@ pon@@ ent of DNA , something everyone is fami@@ li@@ ar with , and which is sh@@ own in this image ."
DNA is our gen@@ e@@ tic h@@ eri@@ t@@ age .
"It is extre@@ me@@ ly important , and once again , ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us is a key pla@@ y@@ er ."
"Now , where do we find this ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us ?"
"As hum@@ ans , where do we find it ?"
"As I expla@@ ined ear@@ lie@@ r , plan@@ ts ex@@ trac@@ t ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us from the so@@ il , through water ."
"So , we hum@@ ans get it from the things we e@@ at : plan@@ ts , ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les , f@@ ru@@ its , and also from e@@ g@@ gs , me@@ at and mi@@ l@@ k ."
It ’ s true that some hum@@ ans e@@ at better than others .
S@@ ome are ha@@ p@@ pie@@ r than others .
"And now , looking at this picture , which spe@@ ak@@ s for itself , we see moder@@ n agri@@ culture , which I also ref@@ er to as inten@@ sive agri@@ culture ."
In@@ ten@@ sive agri@@ culture is based on the use of chemi@@ cal fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers .
"Wi@@ th@@ out them , we would not man@@ age to produ@@ ce enough to fe@@ ed the world &apos;s popul@@ ation ."
"S@@ pe@@ aking of hum@@ ans , there are cur@@ r@@ ently 7 billion of us on Earth ."
"In less than 40 years , there will be 9 billion of us ."
And the question is a simple one : Do we have enough ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us to fe@@ ed our future gener@@ ations ?
"So , in order to understand these issu@@ es , where do we find our ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us ?"
Let me expla@@ in .
"But first , let ’ s just sup@@ pos@@ e that we are using 100 percent of a given do@@ se of ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us ."
O@@ n@@ ly 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the pl@@ ant . E@@ igh@@ ty@@ -@@ five percent is lost .
"It goes into the so@@ il , ending its jour@@ ney in the l@@ ak@@ es , resul@@ ting in l@@ ak@@ es with ex@@ tra ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us , which le@@ ads to the blue al@@ ga@@ e problem ."
"So , you ’ ll see there ’ s a problem here , something that is il@@ logi@@ cal ."
"A hundre@@ d percent of the ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us is used , but only 15 percent goes to the pl@@ ant ."
You ’ re going to tell me it ’ s wa@@ ste@@ ful .
"@@ Yes , it is . What is wor@@ se is that it is very ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
"N@@ ob@@ ody wan@@ ts to th@@ row their money out the win@@ do@@ w , but un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely that &apos;s what is happening here ."
E@@ igh@@ ty percent of each do@@ se of ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us is lost .
M@@ od@@ er@@ n agri@@ culture depen@@ ds on ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us .
"And because in order to get 15 percent of it to the pl@@ ant , all the rest is lost , we have to ad@@ d more and more ."
"Now , where will we get this ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us from ?"
"B@@ a@@ si@@ cally , we get it out of min@@ es ."
"This is the co@@ ver of an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary arti@@ cle publi@@ shed in N@@ ature in 200@@ 9 , which really la@@ un@@ ched the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion about the ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us cri@@ sis ."
"P@@ ho@@ sp@@ hor@@ us , a nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ t essen@@ tial to life , which is be@@ coming incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly sc@@ ar@@ ce , yet no@@ body is talking about it ."
And everyone ag@@ re@@ es : Po@@ li@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans and scienti@@ sts are in ag@@ re@@ ement that we are he@@ ad@@ ed for a ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us cri@@ sis .
"What you are seeing here is an open@@ -@@ p@@ it m@@ ine in the U.@@ S. , and to give you an idea of the di@@ men@@ sions of this m@@ ine , if you look in the top ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand cor@@ ner , the little c@@ r@@ ane you can see , that is a gi@@ ant c@@ r@@ ane ."
So that really pu@@ ts it into perspe@@ ctive .
"So , we get ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us from min@@ es ."
"And if I make a com@@ par@@ is@@ on with oil , there ’ s an oil cri@@ sis , we talk about it , we talk about global war@@ ming , yet we never men@@ tion the ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us cri@@ sis ."
"To come back to the oil problem , oil is something we can re@@ place ."
"We can use bio@@ fu@@ els , or solar power , or hy@@ dro@@ power , but ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us is an essen@@ tial ele@@ ment , indi@@ sp@@ en@@ s@@ able to life , and we can ’ t re@@ place it ."
What is the cur@@ r@@ ent state of the world &apos;s ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us re@@ ser@@ ves ?
This gra@@ ph gi@@ ves you a rou@@ gh idea of where we are today .
The black line re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts pre@@ di@@ ctions for ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us re@@ ser@@ ves .
"In 20@@ 30 , we ’ ll re@@ ach the pe@@ ak ."
"B@@ y the end of this century , it will all be gone ."
The dot@@ ted line shows where we are today .
"As you can see , they me@@ et in 20@@ 30 , I ’ ll be re@@ ti@@ red by then ."
"But we are in@@ de@@ ed he@@ ading for a major cri@@ sis , and I ’ d like people to become aw@@ are of this problem ."
Do we have a solution ?
What are we to do ? We are fac@@ ed with a par@@ ad@@ o@@ x .
L@@ ess and less ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us will be available .
"B@@ y 20@@ 50 there will be 9 billion of us , and ac@@ cor@@ ding to the U.@@ N@@ . F@@ o@@ od and A@@ g@@ ri@@ culture O@@ r@@ gani@@ z@@ ation , we will need to produ@@ ce t@@ wi@@ ce as much food in 20@@ 50 than we do today ."
"So , we will have less ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us , but we &apos;ll need to produ@@ ce more food ."
What should we do ?
It tru@@ ly is a par@@ ad@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ cal situ@@ ation .
"D@@ o we have a solution , or an alter@@ n@@ ative which will al@@ low us to op@@ ti@@ mi@@ ze ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us use ?"
Re@@ member that 80 percent is de@@ st@@ ined to be lost .
"The solution I &apos;m of@@ fer@@ ing today is one that has ex@@ ist@@ ed for a very long time , even before plan@@ ts ex@@ ist@@ ed on Earth , and it &apos;s a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic mus@@ h@@ room that is very m@@ yst@@ eri@@ ous , very simple , and yet also extre@@ me@@ ly comple@@ x ."
I &apos;ve been fas@@ cin@@ ated by this little mus@@ h@@ room for over 16 years now .
It has led me to f@@ ur@@ ther my research and to use it as a model for my labor@@ at@@ ory research .
This mus@@ h@@ room ex@@ ist@@ s in sym@@ bio@@ sis with the ro@@ ots .
"B@@ y sym@@ bio@@ sis , I mean a bi@@ dire@@ cti@@ onal and mu@@ tually b@@ ene@@ fi@@ cial as@@ so@@ ci@@ ation which is also called my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za ."
This sli@@ de il@@ lu@@ str@@ ates the ele@@ ments of a my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za .
"You ’ re looking at the ro@@ ot of whe@@ at , one of the world ’ s most important plan@@ ts ."
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , a ro@@ ot will find ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us all by itself ."
"It will go in sear@@ ch of ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us , but only within the one mi@@ lli@@ me@@ ter which sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ds it ."
"B@@ ey@@ ond one mi@@ lli@@ me@@ ter , the ro@@ ot is in@@ effe@@ ctive ."
It cannot go f@@ ur@@ ther in its sear@@ ch for ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us .
"Now , imagine this t@@ iny , micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic mus@@ h@@ room ."
"It grow@@ s much f@@ ast@@ er , and is much better desig@@ ned to se@@ ek out ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us ."
It can go be@@ y@@ ond the ro@@ ot ’ s one@@ -@@ mi@@ lli@@ me@@ ter sc@@ op@@ e to se@@ ek out ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us .
I ha@@ ven ’ t inv@@ en@@ ted anything at all ; it &apos;s a bi@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy that has ex@@ ist@@ ed for 4@@ 50 million years .
"And over time , this mus@@ h@@ room has ev@@ olved and ad@@ ap@@ ted to se@@ ek out even the t@@ in@@ ie@@ st tr@@ ace of ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us , and to put it to use , to make it available to the pl@@ ant ."
"What you ’ re seeing here , in the real world , is a car@@ ro@@ t ro@@ ot , and the mus@@ h@@ room with its very f@@ ine fil@@ am@@ ents ."
"L@@ o@@ o@@ king clo@@ s@@ er , we can see that this mus@@ h@@ room is very g@@ ent@@ le in its pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ation ."
"It will pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ate between the ro@@ ot &apos;s cells , ev@@ en@@ tually pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ating a cell and star@@ ting to form a ty@@ pi@@ cal ar@@ bus@@ cular structure , which will consi@@ der@@ ably incre@@ ase the ex@@ change inter@@ face between the pl@@ ant and the mus@@ h@@ room ."
And it is through this structure that mu@@ tu@@ al ex@@ chang@@ es will oc@@ cu@@ r .
"It ’ s a win@@ -@@ wi@@ n tra@@ de : I give you ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us , and you fe@@ ed me ."
T@@ ru@@ e sym@@ bio@@ sis .
Now let &apos;s ad@@ d a my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za pl@@ ant into the di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m I used ear@@ lie@@ r .
"And instead of using a 100 percent do@@ se , I ’ m going to redu@@ ce it to 25 percent ."
"You ’ ll see that of this 25 percent , most will b@@ en@@ ef@@ it the pl@@ ant , more than 90 percent ."
A very small amount of ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us will re@@ ma@@ in in the so@@ il .
That &apos;s completely natural .
"What &apos;s more is that in certain c@@ ases , we don &apos;t even need to ad@@ d ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us ."
"If you re@@ call the gra@@ ph@@ s I show@@ ed you ear@@ lie@@ r , 8@@ 5 percent of ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us is lost in the so@@ il , and the plan@@ ts are u@@ na@@ ble to ac@@ cess it ."
"E@@ ven though it is present in the so@@ il , it is in in@@ solu@@ ble form ."
The pl@@ ant is only able to se@@ ek out solu@@ ble form@@ s .
The mus@@ h@@ room is cap@@ able of dis@@ sol@@ ving this in@@ solu@@ ble form and making it available for the pl@@ ant to use .
"To f@@ ur@@ ther sup@@ port my ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent , here is a picture that spe@@ ak@@ s for itself ."
These are tri@@ als in a fie@@ ld of sor@@ gh@@ um .
"O@@ n the left side , you see the y@@ ie@@ ld produ@@ ced using con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal agri@@ culture , with a 100 percent ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us do@@ se ."
"O@@ n the other side , the do@@ se was redu@@ ced to 50 percent , and just look at the y@@ ie@@ ld ."
"Wi@@ th only a hal@@ f-@@ do@@ se , we ach@@ ie@@ ved a better y@@ ie@@ ld ."
This is to show you that this meth@@ od works .
"And in some c@@ ases , in C@@ u@@ ba , M@@ exi@@ co and Indi@@ a , the do@@ se can be redu@@ ced to 25 percent , and in se@@ ver@@ al other c@@ ases , there &apos;s no need to ad@@ d any ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us at all , because the mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms are so well ad@@ ap@@ ted to fin@@ ding ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us and d@@ raw@@ ing it from the so@@ il ."
This is an example of so@@ y produ@@ ction in C@@ an@@ ada .
M@@ y@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za was used in one fie@@ ld but not in the other .
"And here , where blue indi@@ c@@ ates a better y@@ ie@@ ld , and y@@ el@@ low a we@@ ak@@ er y@@ ie@@ ld ."
The black re@@ ct@@ ang@@ le is the p@@ lot from which the my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za was ad@@ ded .
"In other words , as I already said , I have inv@@ en@@ ted nothing ."
"M@@ y@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za has ex@@ ist@@ ed for 4@@ 50 million years , and it has even hel@@ ped moder@@ n@@ -@@ day pl@@ ant species to di@@ ver@@ si@@ fy ."
"So , this it isn &apos;t something that is still under@@ going la@@ b te@@ sts ."
"M@@ y@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za ex@@ ist@@ s , it works , it &apos;s produ@@ ced at an indu@@ stri@@ al scale and comm@@ er@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ed wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
The problem is that people are not aw@@ are of it .
Pe@@ ople like food produ@@ c@@ ers and farm@@ ers are still not aw@@ are of this problem .
"We have a technology that works , and one that , if used cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ly , will al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate some of the pres@@ sure we are pu@@ tting on the world &apos;s ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us re@@ ser@@ ves ."
"In con@@ clu@@ sion , I am a scienti@@ st and a dre@@ am@@ er ."
I &apos;m pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate about this top@@ ic .
"So if you were to ask me what my re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment dre@@ am is , which will be at the moment we re@@ ach that ph@@ o@@ sp@@ hor@@ us pe@@ ak , it would be that we use one la@@ be@@ l , &quot; &quot; M@@ ade with my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za , &quot; &quot; and that my children and grand@@ children bu@@ y produ@@ cts be@@ aring that la@@ be@@ l too ."
Thank you for your at@@ ten@@ tion .
( Applause )
"In the next 18 minutes , I &apos;m going to take you on a jour@@ ney ."
"And it &apos;s a jour@@ ney that you and I have been on for many years now , and it began some 50 years ago , when hum@@ ans first ste@@ pped off our planet ."
"And in those 50 years , not only did we liter@@ ally , physi@@ cally set fo@@ ot on the mo@@ on , but we have disp@@ at@@ ched rob@@ oti@@ c sp@@ ace@@ c@@ ra@@ ft to all the plane@@ ts — all eight of them — and we have lan@@ ded on ast@@ er@@ o@@ i@@ ds , we have ren@@ de@@ z@@ v@@ ous@@ ed with com@@ ets , and , at this point in time , we have a sp@@ ace@@ c@@ ra@@ ft on its way to P@@ lu@@ to , the body form@@ er@@ ly known as a planet ."
"And all of these rob@@ oti@@ c mis@@ sions are part of a bi@@ g@@ ger human jour@@ ney : a vo@@ y@@ age to understand something , to get a sense of our co@@ smi@@ c place , to understand something of our ori@@ gin@@ s , and how Earth , our planet , and we , living on it , came to be ."
"And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and sear@@ ch for ans@@ w@@ ers to questions like this , there &apos;s S@@ atur@@ n . And we have been to S@@ atur@@ n before — we visi@@ ted S@@ atur@@ n in the early 19@@ 8@@ 0s — but our inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ations of S@@ atur@@ n have become far more in@@ -@@ de@@ p@@ th in de@@ ta@@ il since the C@@ as@@ sin@@ i sp@@ ace@@ c@@ ra@@ ft , tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing across inter@@ plan@@ et@@ ary space for seven years , g@@ li@@ ded into or@@ bit around S@@ atur@@ n in the sum@@ m@@ er of 200@@ 4 , and became at that point the far@@ th@@ est rob@@ oti@@ c out@@ pos@@ t that hum@@ ani@@ ty had ever est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed around the Su@@ n ."
"Now , the S@@ atur@@ n system is a ri@@ ch plan@@ et@@ ary system ."
"It of@@ f@@ ers m@@ yst@@ ery , scienti@@ fic in@@ si@@ ght and obvi@@ ously sp@@ len@@ d@@ or be@@ y@@ ond comp@@ are , and the inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ation of this system has en@@ or@@ m@@ ous co@@ smi@@ c re@@ ach ."
"In fact , just stu@@ dy@@ ing the r@@ ings alone , we stand to learn a lot about the di@@ sc@@ s of star@@ s and gas that we call the spi@@ ral gal@@ ax@@ ies ."
"And here &apos;s a beautiful picture of the An@@ dro@@ me@@ da Ne@@ bu@@ la , which is our clo@@ s@@ est , largest spi@@ ral gal@@ ax@@ y to the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay ."
"And then , here &apos;s a beautiful com@@ posi@@ te of the W@@ hi@@ r@@ l@@ po@@ ol G@@ al@@ ax@@ y , taken by the H@@ u@@ b@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e ."
"So the jour@@ ney back to S@@ atur@@ n is really part of and is also a me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or for a much lar@@ ger human vo@@ y@@ age to understand the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ te@@ d@@ ness of everything around us , and also how hum@@ ans f@@ it into that picture ."
And it pa@@ ins me that I can &apos;t tell you all that we have learned with C@@ as@@ sin@@ i .
"I can &apos;t show you all the beautiful pi@@ ctures that we &apos;ve taken in the last two and a half years , because I simply don &apos;t have the time ."
"So I &apos;m going to con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate on two of the most exci@@ ting stories that have em@@ er@@ g@@ ed out of this major expl@@ or@@ at@@ ory expe@@ di@@ tion that we are con@@ du@@ cting around S@@ atur@@ n , and have been for the past two and a half years ."
S@@ atur@@ n is ac@@ comp@@ an@@ ied by a very large and di@@ verse colle@@ ction of mo@@ ons .
They r@@ ange in size from a few kilome@@ ters across to as big across as the U.@@ S.
"Mo@@ st of the beautiful pi@@ ctures we &apos;ve taken of S@@ atur@@ n , in fact , show S@@ atur@@ n in ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ment with some of its mo@@ ons . Here &apos;s S@@ atur@@ n with D@@ i@@ one , and then , here &apos;s S@@ atur@@ n show@@ ing the r@@ ings ed@@ ge@@ -@@ on , show@@ ing you just how ver@@ ti@@ cally th@@ in they are , with the mo@@ on En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us ."
"Now , two of the 4@@ 7 mo@@ ons that S@@ atur@@ n has are stan@@ d@@ ou@@ ts ."
"And those are T@@ it@@ an and En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . T@@ it@@ an is S@@ atur@@ n &apos;s largest mo@@ on , and , until C@@ as@@ sin@@ i had ar@@ ri@@ ved there , was the largest single ex@@ pan@@ se of u@@ ne@@ x@@ plo@@ red ter@@ ra@@ in that we had re@@ ma@@ ining in our solar system ."
And it is a body that has long in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed people who &apos;ve wat@@ ched the plane@@ ts .
"It has a very large , thi@@ ck atmo@@ sp@@ here , and in fact , its surface environment was belie@@ ved to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth , or at least had in the past , than any other body in the solar system ."
"I@@ ts atmo@@ sp@@ here is lar@@ ge@@ ly mo@@ le@@ cular ni@@ tro@@ g@@ en , like you are bre@@ a@@ thing here in this room , ex@@ cept that its atmo@@ sp@@ here is su@@ f@@ f@@ used with simple organi@@ c materi@@ als like meth@@ ane and pro@@ p@@ ane and e@@ th@@ ane ."
"And these mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les high up in the atmo@@ sp@@ here of T@@ it@@ an get bro@@ k@@ en down , and their produ@@ cts jo@@ in together to make ha@@ ze parti@@ cles ."
This ha@@ ze is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous . It &apos;s completely global and en@@ velo@@ ping T@@ it@@ an .
And that &apos;s why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visi@@ ble regi@@ on of the spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m .
"But these ha@@ ze parti@@ cles , it was sur@@ mis@@ ed , before we got there with C@@ as@@ sin@@ i , over bi@@ llions and bi@@ llions of years , g@@ ently dri@@ f@@ ted down to the surface and co@@ ated the surface in a thi@@ ck organi@@ c s@@ lu@@ dge ."
"So like the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent , the T@@ it@@ an e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent , of t@@ ar , or oil , or what — we didn &apos;t know what ."
"But this is what we s@@ us@@ pe@@ cted . And these mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les , es@@ pe@@ cially meth@@ ane and e@@ th@@ ane , can be li@@ qui@@ ds at the surface temper@@ at@@ ures of T@@ it@@ an ."
And so it turns out that meth@@ ane is to T@@ it@@ an what water is to the Earth .
"It &apos;s a con@@ den@@ s@@ able in the atmo@@ sp@@ here , and so re@@ cogni@@ z@@ ing this cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stance brought to the fore a whole world of bi@@ zar@@ re possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies . You can have meth@@ ane cl@@ ou@@ ds , OK , and ab@@ o@@ ve those cl@@ ou@@ ds , you have this hundre@@ ds of kilome@@ ters of ha@@ ze , which pre@@ v@@ ent any su@@ n@@ light from getting to the surface ."
The temper@@ ature at the surface is some 3@@ 50 de@@ gre@@ es be@@ low zer@@ o F@@ a@@ h@@ ren@@ he@@ it .
"But des@@ pi@@ te that c@@ old , you could have ra@@ in fal@@ ling down on the surface of T@@ it@@ an ."
And doing on T@@ it@@ an what ra@@ in does on the Earth : it car@@ ves gu@@ ll@@ ies ; it form@@ s ri@@ ver@@ s and cat@@ ar@@ ac@@ ts ; it can create c@@ any@@ ons ; it can po@@ ol in large bas@@ ins and c@@ rat@@ ers .
"It can wa@@ sh the s@@ lu@@ dge off high m@@ oun@@ tain pe@@ ak@@ s and h@@ il@@ ls , down into the low@@ l@@ ands . So stop and think for a minu@@ te ."
T@@ ry to imagine what the surface of T@@ it@@ an might look like .
It &apos;s dar@@ k . Hi@@ gh no@@ on on T@@ it@@ an is as dar@@ k as de@@ ep ear@@ th t@@ wi@@ light on the Earth .
"It &apos;s c@@ old , it &apos;s e@@ er@@ ie , it &apos;s mist@@ y , it might be ra@@ ining , and you might be standing on the sho@@ res of L@@ ake Mi@@ chi@@ g@@ an bri@@ m@@ ming with pa@@ int thin@@ ner . ( Laughter ) That is the view that we had of the surface of T@@ it@@ an before we got there with C@@ as@@ sin@@ i , and I can tell you that what we have found on T@@ it@@ an , though it is not the same in de@@ ta@@ il , is every bit as fas@@ cin@@ ating as that story is ."
"And for us , it has been like — the C@@ as@@ sin@@ i people — it has been like a Ju@@ les V@@ er@@ ne ad@@ ven@@ ture come true ."
"As I said , it has a thi@@ ck , ex@@ ten@@ sive atmo@@ sp@@ here ."
"This is a picture of T@@ it@@ an , bac@@ kli@@ t by the Su@@ n , with the r@@ ings as a beautiful back@@ dro@@ p ."
And yet another mo@@ on there — I don &apos;t even know which one it is . It &apos;s a very ex@@ ten@@ sive atmo@@ sp@@ here .
"We have instru@@ ments on C@@ as@@ sin@@ i which can see down to the surface through this atmo@@ sp@@ here , and my cam@@ era system is one of them ."
And we have taken pi@@ ctures like this .
"And what you see is b@@ right and dar@@ k regi@@ ons , and that &apos;s about as far as it got for us ."
It was so m@@ yst@@ i@@ f@@ ying : we couldn &apos;t make out what we were seeing on T@@ it@@ an .
"When you look clo@@ s@@ er at this regi@@ on , you start to see things like sin@@ u@@ ous ch@@ an@@ ne@@ ls — we didn &apos;t know . You see a few round things ."
"This , we later found out , is , in fact , a c@@ rat@@ er , but there are very few c@@ rat@@ ers on the surface of T@@ it@@ an , me@@ an@@ ing it &apos;s a very young surface ."
And there are fe@@ at@@ ures that look te@@ ct@@ on@@ ic .
They look like they &apos;ve been pul@@ led a@@ part .
"Wh@@ en@@ ever you see anything lin@@ e@@ ar on a planet , it means there &apos;s been a f@@ rac@@ ture , like a f@@ au@@ l@@ t ."
And so it &apos;s been te@@ ct@@ oni@@ cally alter@@ ed .
"But we couldn &apos;t make sense of our images , until , six months after we got into or@@ bit , an ev@@ ent oc@@ cur@@ red that many have re@@ gar@@ ded as the high@@ light of C@@ as@@ sin@@ i &apos;s inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ation of T@@ it@@ an ."
"And that was the de@@ plo@@ y@@ ment of the H@@ u@@ y@@ gen@@ s pro@@ be , the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an@@ -@@ built H@@ u@@ y@@ gen@@ s pro@@ be that C@@ as@@ sin@@ i had car@@ ried for seven years across the solar system . We de@@ plo@@ yed it to the atmo@@ sp@@ here of T@@ it@@ an , it took two and a half hours to des@@ cen@@ d , and it lan@@ ded on the surface ."
And I just want to em@@ p@@ ha@@ size how sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant an ev@@ ent this is .
"This is a de@@ vice of human making , and it lan@@ ded in the ou@@ ter solar system for the first time in human history ."
"It is so sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant that , in my mind , this was an ev@@ ent that should have been ce@@ le@@ br@@ ated with ti@@ ck@@ er ta@@ pe par@@ a@@ des in every city across the U.@@ S. and Europ@@ e , and s@@ ad@@ ly , that wasn &apos;t the case ."
( Laughter ) .
"It was sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant for another reason . This is an inter@@ national mis@@ sion , and this ev@@ ent was ce@@ le@@ br@@ ated in Europ@@ e , in G@@ er@@ many , and the ce@@ le@@ br@@ at@@ ory pres@@ ent@@ ations were given in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ac@@ c@@ ents , and American ac@@ c@@ ents , and G@@ er@@ man ac@@ c@@ ents , and F@@ ren@@ ch and I@@ t@@ ali@@ an and D@@ ut@@ ch ac@@ c@@ ents ."
It was a moving de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of what the words &quot; &quot; uni@@ ted n@@ ations &quot; &quot; are sup@@ posed to mean : a true uni@@ on of n@@ ations jo@@ ined together in a co@@ lo@@ s@@ s@@ al ef@@ for@@ t for good .
"And , in this case , it was a mas@@ sive under@@ taking to expl@@ ore a planet , and to come to understand a plan@@ et@@ ary system that , for all of human history , had been un@@ re@@ ac@@ ha@@ ble , and now hum@@ ans had actually tou@@ ched it ."
"So it was — I mean , I &apos;m getting go@@ ose bu@@ m@@ ps just talking about it ."
"It was a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously emoti@@ onal ev@@ ent , and it &apos;s something that I will per@@ son@@ ally never for@@ get , and you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t either ."
( Applause ) .
"But any@@ way , the pro@@ be took meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments of the atmo@@ sp@@ here on the way down , and it also took pan@@ or@@ ami@@ c pi@@ ctures ."
And I can &apos;t tell you what it was like to see the first pi@@ ctures of T@@ it@@ an &apos;s surface from the pro@@ be . And this is what we saw .
"And it was a sho@@ ck@@ er , because it was everything we wanted those other pi@@ ctures taken from or@@ bit to be ."
"It was an u@@ na@@ m@@ bi@@ gu@@ ous pat@@ ter@@ n , a ge@@ ologi@@ cal pat@@ ter@@ n ."
It &apos;s a den@@ dri@@ tic dra@@ in@@ age pat@@ ter@@ n that can be form@@ ed only by the f@@ low of li@@ qui@@ ds .
And you can fol@@ low these ch@@ an@@ ne@@ ls and you can see how they all con@@ ver@@ ge .
"And they con@@ ver@@ ge into this ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l here , which dra@@ ins into this regi@@ on ."
You are looking at a sho@@ rel@@ ine .
W@@ as this a sho@@ rel@@ ine of flu@@ i@@ ds ? We didn &apos;t know .
But this is some@@ what of a sho@@ rel@@ ine .
This picture is taken at 16 kilome@@ ters .
"This is the picture taken at eight kilome@@ ters , OK ? A@@ ga@@ in , the sho@@ rel@@ ine ."
"O@@ kay , now , 16 kilome@@ ters , eight kilome@@ ters — this is rou@@ gh@@ ly an air@@ line al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de ."
"If you were going to take an air@@ pl@@ ane tri@@ p across the U.@@ S. , you would be fl@@ ying at these al@@ ti@@ tu@@ des ."
"So , this is the picture you would have at the win@@ do@@ w of T@@ it@@ ani@@ an A@@ ir@@ lin@@ es as you f@@ ly across the surface of T@@ it@@ an . ( Laughter ) And then finally , the pro@@ be came to rest on the surface , and I &apos;m going to show you , l@@ ad@@ ies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , the first picture ever taken from the surface of a mo@@ on in the ou@@ ter solar system ."
"And here is the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on , OK ?"
"These are probably water ice pe@@ b@@ b@@ les , y@@ es ?"
( Applause ) .
"And obvi@@ ously , it lan@@ ded in one of these f@@ lat , dar@@ k regi@@ ons and it didn &apos;t sin@@ k out of si@@ ght . So it wasn &apos;t flu@@ id that we lan@@ ded in ."
What the pro@@ be came down in was basically the T@@ it@@ an e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of a mu@@ d f@@ lat .
This is an un@@ con@@ so@@ li@@ d@@ ated ground that is su@@ f@@ f@@ used with li@@ qu@@ id meth@@ ane .
"And it &apos;s probably the case that this materi@@ al has wa@@ shed off the high@@ l@@ ands of T@@ it@@ an through these ch@@ an@@ ne@@ ls that we saw , and has dra@@ ined over bi@@ llions of years to fi@@ ll in low@@ -@@ l@@ ying bas@@ ins ."
And that is what the H@@ u@@ y@@ gen@@ s pro@@ be lan@@ ded in .
"But still , there was no sig@@ n in our images , or even in the H@@ u@@ y@@ gen@@ s &apos; images , of any large , open bod@@ ies of flu@@ i@@ ds ."
W@@ here were they ? It got even more pu@@ z@@ z@@ ling when we found d@@ un@@ es .
"O@@ K , so this is our movie of the equ@@ at@@ ori@@ al regi@@ on of T@@ it@@ an , show@@ ing these d@@ un@@ es . These are d@@ un@@ es that are 100 me@@ ters t@@ all , se@@ par@@ ated by a few kilome@@ ters , and they go on for miles and miles and miles ."
"There &apos;s hundre@@ ds , up to a 1@@ ,000 or 1@@ ,@@ 2@@ 00 miles of d@@ un@@ es ."
This is the S@@ a@@ har@@ an des@@ er@@ t of T@@ it@@ an .
"It &apos;s obvi@@ ously a place which is very d@@ ry , or you wouldn &apos;t get d@@ un@@ es ."
"So again , it got pu@@ z@@ z@@ ling that there were no bod@@ ies of flu@@ id , until finally , we saw l@@ ak@@ es in the pol@@ ar regi@@ ons ."
And there is a l@@ ake scen@@ e in the s@@ outh pol@@ ar regi@@ on of T@@ it@@ an .
It &apos;s about the size of L@@ ake O@@ n@@ t@@ ari@@ o .
"And then , only a week and a half ago , we f@@ le@@ w over the nor@@ th po@@ le of T@@ it@@ an and found , again , we found a fe@@ ature here the size of the C@@ as@@ pi@@ an Se@@ a ."
"So it seem@@ s that the li@@ qui@@ ds , for some reason we don &apos;t understand , or during at least this se@@ as@@ on , are ap@@ par@@ ently at the po@@ les of T@@ it@@ an ."
"And I think you would ag@@ ree that we have found T@@ it@@ an is a re@@ mark@@ able , m@@ yst@@ i@@ cal place . It &apos;s ex@@ oti@@ c , it &apos;s al@@ ie@@ n , but yet str@@ ang@@ ely Ear@@ th@@ -@@ like , and having Ear@@ th@@ -@@ like ge@@ ologi@@ cal form@@ ations and a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal di@@ versity , and is a fas@@ cin@@ ating world wh@@ ose only ri@@ v@@ al in the solar system for comple@@ x@@ ity and ri@@ ch@@ ness is the Earth itself ."
"And so now we go on@@ to En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us is a small mo@@ on , it &apos;s about a ten@@ th the size of T@@ it@@ an . And you can see it here next to En@@ gl@@ and , just to show you the size . This is not me@@ ant to be a thre@@ at ."
( Laughter ) .
"And En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us is very white , it &apos;s very b@@ right , and its surface is obvi@@ ously w@@ re@@ cked with f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res ."
It is a very ge@@ ologi@@ cally ac@@ tive body .
But the mother lo@@ de of disco@@ ver@@ ies on En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us was found at the s@@ outh po@@ le — and we &apos;re looking at the s@@ outh po@@ le here — where we found this system of f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res .
And they &apos;re a different color because they &apos;re a different com@@ posi@@ tion .
They are co@@ ated . These f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res are co@@ ated with organi@@ c materi@@ als .
"Mo@@ re@@ over , this whole , entire regi@@ on , the s@@ outh pol@@ ar regi@@ on , has ele@@ v@@ ated temper@@ at@@ ures . It &apos;s the hot@@ test place on the planet , on the body ."
That &apos;s as bi@@ zar@@ re as fin@@ ding that the An@@ tar@@ cti@@ c on the Earth is hot@@ ter than the tro@@ pi@@ cs .
"And then , when we took ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal pi@@ ctures , we disco@@ vered that from these f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res are issu@@ ing je@@ ts of f@@ ine , i@@ cy parti@@ cles ex@@ ten@@ ding hundre@@ ds of miles into space ."
"And when we col@@ or@@ -@@ c@@ od@@ e this image , to bring out the fa@@ int light le@@ v@@ els , we see that these je@@ ts fe@@ ed a p@@ lu@@ me that , in fact , we see , in other images , goes thousands of miles into the space ab@@ o@@ ve En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us ."
"My team and I have exam@@ ined images like this , and like this one , and have thought about the other resul@@ ts from C@@ as@@ sin@@ i ."
And we have ar@@ ri@@ ved at the con@@ clu@@ sion that these je@@ ts may be er@@ up@@ ting from po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts of li@@ qu@@ id water under the surface of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
"So we have , possi@@ bly , li@@ qu@@ id water , organi@@ c materi@@ als and ex@@ cess he@@ at ."
"In other words , we have possi@@ bly st@@ um@@ b@@ led upo@@ n the ho@@ ly gra@@ il of moder@@ n day plan@@ et@@ ary expl@@ or@@ ation , or in other words , an environment that is poten@@ ti@@ ally su@@ it@@ able for living organi@@ s@@ ms ."
"And I don &apos;t think I need to tell you that the disco@@ very of life el@@ se@@ where in our solar system , whether it be on En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us or el@@ se@@ where , would have en@@ or@@ m@@ ous cul@@ tu@@ ral and scienti@@ fic im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations ."
"Because if we could de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that gen@@ e@@ sis had oc@@ cur@@ red not once , but t@@ wi@@ ce , in@@ depen@@ d@@ ently , in our solar system , then that means , by in@@ fer@@ ence , it has oc@@ cur@@ red a st@@ ag@@ g@@ ering number of times throu@@ gh@@ out the universe and its 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 7 billion year history ."
"R@@ ight now , Earth is the only planet still that we know is te@@ em@@ ing with life ."
"It is pre@@ ci@@ ous , it is uni@@ qu@@ e , it is still , so far , the only home we &apos;ve ever known ."
"And if any of you were al@@ er@@ t and co@@ her@@ ent during the 19@@ 6@@ 0s — and we &apos;d for@@ give you , if you wer@@ en &apos;t , OK — you would remember this very fam@@ ous picture taken by the A@@ pol@@ l@@ o 8 ast@@ ro@@ nau@@ ts in 19@@ 6@@ 8 ."
"It was the first time that Earth was imag@@ ed from space , and it had an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous impac@@ t on our sense of place in the universe , and our sense of respon@@ si@@ bility for the prote@@ ction of our own planet ."
"Well , we on C@@ as@@ sin@@ i have taken an e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent first , a picture that no human ey@@ e has ever seen before ."
"It is a tot@@ al e@@ cli@@ p@@ se of the Su@@ n , seen from the other side of S@@ atur@@ n ."
"And in this im@@ possi@@ bly beautiful picture , you see the ma@@ in r@@ ings bac@@ kli@@ t by the Su@@ n , you see the ref@@ rac@@ ted image of the Su@@ n and you see this ring created , in fact , by the ex@@ hal@@ ations of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us ."
"But as if that wer@@ en &apos;t bri@@ lli@@ ant enough , we can spo@@ t , in this beautiful image , si@@ ght of our own planet , c@@ ra@@ d@@ led in the ar@@ ms of S@@ atur@@ n &apos;s r@@ ings ."
"Now , there is something de@@ e@@ ply moving about seeing ourselves from af@@ ar , and cap@@ tur@@ ing the si@@ ght of our little , blu@@ e-@@ ocean planet in the sk@@ ies of other wor@@ l@@ ds ."
"And that , and the perspe@@ ctive of ourselves that we ga@@ in from that , may be , in the end , the fin@@ est re@@ ward that we ear@@ n from this jour@@ ney of disco@@ very that started half a century ago ."
And th@@ ank you very much .

Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : We &apos;re having a de@@ b@@ ate .
The de@@ b@@ ate is over the pro@@ posi@@ tion : &quot; &quot; What the world needs now is nuclear energy . &quot; &quot; T@@ ru@@ e or fal@@ se ?
"And before we have the de@@ b@@ ate , I &apos;d like to actually take a show of h@@ ands — on bal@@ ance , right now , are you for or against this ?"
"So those who are &quot; &quot; y@@ es , &quot; &quot; ra@@ ise your hand . &quot; &quot; F@@ or . &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , h@@ ands down ."
"Th@@ ose who are against , ra@@ ise your h@@ ands ."
"O@@ kay , I &apos;m re@@ ading that at about 7@@ 5 to 25 in fa@@ v@@ or at the start ."
"Wh@@ ich means we &apos;re going to take a v@@ ot@@ e at the end and see how that shi@@ f@@ ts , if at all ."
"So here &apos;s the form@@ at : They &apos;re going to have six minutes each , and then after one little , qui@@ ck ex@@ change between them , I want two people on each side of this de@@ b@@ ate in the audience to have 30 secon@@ ds to make one shor@@ t , cri@@ s@@ p , pun@@ g@@ ent , powerful point ."

Ste@@ war@@ t B@@ r@@ and : Wh@@ o@@ a .

"Wi@@ th nuclear , those who know the most are the least wor@@ ried ."

This is the design situ@@ ation : a planet that is fac@@ ing clim@@ ate change and is now half urb@@ an .
L@@ ook at the cl@@ ien@@ t b@@ ase for this .
F@@ i@@ ve out of six of us live in the develo@@ ping world .
We are moving to cities . We are moving up in the world .
"And we are edu@@ c@@ ating our kids , having fe@@ wer kids , basically good news all around ."
"But we move to cities , tow@@ ard the b@@ right li@@ ghts , and one of the things that is there that we want , be@@ si@@ des j@@ ob@@ s , is electri@@ city ."
"And if it isn &apos;t e@@ a@@ si@@ ly got@@ ten , we &apos;ll go a@@ head and ste@@ al it ."
"This is one of the most de@@ si@@ red things by po@@ or people all over the world , in the cities and in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
"E@@ le@@ ctri@@ city for cities , at its best , is what &apos;s called bas@@ e@@ lo@@ ad electri@@ city ."
That &apos;s where it is on all the time .
"And so far there are only three major sources of that — co@@ al and gas , hy@@ dro@@ -@@ electri@@ c , which in most places is ma@@ x@@ ed@@ -@@ out — and nuclear ."
"I would love to have something in the f@@ our@@ th place here , but in terms of con@@ st@@ ant , cle@@ an , sc@@ al@@ able energy , &#91; solar &#93; and wind and the other r@@ ene@@ wa@@ b@@ les ar@@ en &apos;t there yet because they &apos;re in@@ con@@ st@@ ant ."
N@@ u@@ clear is and has been for 40 years .
"Now , from an environ@@ ment@@ al stan@@ d@@ point , the ma@@ in thing you want to look at is what happens to the wa@@ ste from nuclear and from co@@ al , the two major sources of electri@@ city ."
"If all of your electri@@ city in your li@@ fe@@ time came from nuclear , the wa@@ ste from that li@@ fe@@ time of electri@@ city would go in a Co@@ ke can — a pretty he@@ av@@ y Co@@ ke can , about two po@@ un@@ ds ."
But one day of co@@ al ad@@ ds up to one he@@ ll of a lot of car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de in a nor@@ mal one@@ -@@ gi@@ g@@ aw@@ at@@ t co@@ al@@ -@@ fi@@ red pl@@ ant .
Th@@ en what happens to the wa@@ ste ?
The nuclear wa@@ ste ty@@ pi@@ cally goes into a d@@ ry c@@ ask stor@@ age out back of the par@@ king lot at the re@@ ac@@ tor site because most places don &apos;t have under@@ ground stor@@ age yet .
"It &apos;s just as well , because it can st@@ ay where it is ."
"W@@ hi@@ le the car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de , v@@ ast qu@@ anti@@ ties of it , gi@@ gat@@ ons , goes into the atmo@@ sp@@ here where we can &apos;t get it back — yet — and where it is ca@@ using the problems that we &apos;re most con@@ cer@@ ned about ."
"So when you ad@@ d up the gre@@ en@@ house g@@ ases in the li@@ fe@@ time of these v@@ ari@@ ous energy sources , nuclear is down there with wind and hy@@ d@@ r@@ o , be@@ low solar and way be@@ low , obvi@@ ously , all the f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els ."
W@@ ind is wonderful ; I love wind .
I love being around these big wind gener@@ at@@ ors .
"But one of the things we &apos;re disco@@ ver@@ ing is that wind , like solar , is an actually relati@@ vely di@@ lu@@ te source of energy ."
"And so it takes a very large fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int on the land , a very large fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int in terms of materi@@ als , five to 10 times what you &apos;d use for nuclear , and ty@@ pi@@ cally to get one gi@@ g@@ aw@@ at@@ t of electri@@ city is on the order of 2@@ 50 squ@@ are miles of wind far@@ m ."
"In places like D@@ en@@ mar@@ k and G@@ er@@ many , they &apos;ve ma@@ x@@ ed out on wind already ."
They &apos;ve run out of good si@@ tes .
The power lin@@ es are getting over@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed .

"L@@ i@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , with solar , es@@ pe@@ cially here in C@@ alifor@@ nia , we &apos;re disco@@ ver@@ ing that the 80 solar far@@ m sch@@ em@@ es that are going forward want to basically bu@@ ll@@ do@@ ze 1@@ ,000 squ@@ are miles of s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n C@@ alifor@@ nia des@@ er@@ t ."

And it also en@@ h@@ an@@ ces nuclear we@@ apo@@ ns pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation .
So let &apos;s start just by looking at the C@@ O@@ 2 e@@ mis@@ sions from the life cy@@ cle .
C@@ O@@ 2@@ e e@@ mis@@ sions are e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent e@@ mis@@ sions of all the gre@@ en@@ house g@@ ases and parti@@ cles that cause war@@ ming and con@@ ver@@ ted to C@@ O@@ 2 .

N@@ u@@ clear — there are two bar@@ s here .
"One is a low est@@ im@@ ate , and one is a high est@@ im@@ ate ."
The low est@@ im@@ ate is the nuclear energy indu@@ stry est@@ im@@ ate of nuclear .
"The high is the a@@ ver@@ age of 10@@ 3 scienti@@ fic , pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ w@@ ed stud@@ ies ."
And this is just the C@@ O@@ 2 from the life cy@@ cle .
"If we look at the de@@ la@@ ys , it takes between 10 and 1@@ 9 years to put up a nuclear power pl@@ ant from plan@@ ning to oper@@ ation ."
This inclu@@ des about three and a half to six years for a site per@@ m@@ it .
"@@ and another two and a half to four years for a con@@ stru@@ ction per@@ m@@ it and issue , and then four to n@@ ine years for ac@@ tu@@ al con@@ stru@@ ction ."
"And in China , right now , they &apos;re pu@@ tting up five gi@@ g@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of nuclear ."
"And the a@@ ver@@ age , just for the con@@ stru@@ ction time of these , is 7@@ .@@ 1 years on top of any plan@@ ning times ."
"W@@ hi@@ le you &apos;re wai@@ ting around for your nuclear , you have to run the regu@@ lar electri@@ c power g@@ ri@@ d , which is mo@@ st@@ ly co@@ al in the United States and around the world ."
"And the char@@ t here shows the difference between the e@@ mis@@ sions from the regu@@ lar g@@ ri@@ d , resul@@ ting if you use nuclear , or anything else , ver@@ su@@ s wind , C@@ S@@ P or ph@@ ot@@ o@@ vol@@ ta@@ i@@ cs ."
"W@@ ind takes about two to five years on a@@ ver@@ age , same as con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated solar and ph@@ ot@@ o@@ vol@@ ta@@ i@@ cs ."
"So the difference is the opportunity cost of using nuclear ver@@ su@@ s wind , or something else ."
"So if you ad@@ d these two together , alone , you can see a se@@ par@@ ation that nuclear pu@@ ts out at least n@@ ine to 1@@ 7 times more C@@ O@@ 2 e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent e@@ mis@@ sions than wind energy ."
And this doesn &apos;t even ac@@ coun@@ t for the fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int on the ground .
"If you look at the air pol@@ lu@@ tion health effe@@ cts , this is the number of de@@ a@@ ths per year in 20@@ 20 just from ve@@ hi@@ cle ex@@ ha@@ ust ."
"L@@ et &apos;s say we con@@ ver@@ ted all the ve@@ hi@@ cles in the United States to bat@@ tery electri@@ c ve@@ hi@@ cles , hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en fu@@ el cell ve@@ hi@@ cles or f@@ le@@ x fu@@ el ve@@ hi@@ cles run on E@@ 8@@ 5 ."
"Well , right now in the United States , 50 to 10@@ 0,000 people die per year from air pol@@ lu@@ tion , and ve@@ hi@@ cles are about 2@@ 5@@ ,000 of those ."
"In 20@@ 20 , the number will go down to 1@@ 5@@ ,000 du@@ e to impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents ."
"And so , on the right , you see g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine e@@ mis@@ sions , the death r@@ ates of 20@@ 20 ."
"If you go to cor@@ n or cel@@ lu@@ lo@@ si@@ c e@@ th@@ an@@ ol , you &apos;d actually incre@@ ase the death r@@ ate sli@@ gh@@ tly ."
"If you go to nuclear , you do get a big redu@@ ction , but it &apos;s not as much as with wind and con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated solar ."
"Now if you consi@@ der the fact that nuclear we@@ apo@@ ns pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation is as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with nuclear energy pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation , because we know for example , Indi@@ a and P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an develo@@ ped nuclear we@@ apo@@ ns se@@ cre@@ tly by en@@ ri@@ ching ur@@ ani@@ um in nuclear energy fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ies ."
Nor@@ th Kore@@ a did that to some ex@@ t@@ ent .
I@@ ran is doing that right now .
And V@@ ene@@ zu@@ el@@ a would be doing it if they started with their nuclear energy fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ies .
"If you do a large scale ex@@ pan@@ sion of nuclear energy across the world , and as a resul@@ t there was just one nuclear b@@ om@@ b created that was used to de@@ stro@@ y a city such as M@@ um@@ ba@@ i or some other big city , me@@ g@@ aci@@ ty , the ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal death r@@ ates du@@ e to this a@@ ver@@ aged over 30 years and then sc@@ al@@ ed to the popul@@ ation of the U.@@ S@@ ."
would be this .
"So , do we need this ?"
The next thing is : What about the fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int ? Ste@@ war@@ t men@@ tion@@ ed the fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int .
"A@@ c@@ tually , the fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int on the ground for wind is by far the s@@ mal@@ l@@ est of any energy source in the world ."
"That , because the fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int , as you can see , is just the po@@ le tou@@ ching the ground ."
"And you can power the entire U.@@ S. ve@@ hi@@ cle f@@ le@@ et with 7@@ 3@@ ,000 to 1@@ 4@@ 5@@ ,000 fi@@ ve@@ -@@ me@@ g@@ aw@@ at@@ t wind tur@@ bin@@ es ."
"That would take between one and three squ@@ are kilome@@ ters of fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int on the ground , enti@@ re@@ ly ."
The sp@@ ac@@ ing is something else .
That &apos;s the fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int that is always being con@@ f@@ used .
Pe@@ ople con@@ f@@ use fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int with sp@@ ac@@ ing .
"As you can see from these pi@@ ctures , the sp@@ ac@@ ing between can be used for mul@@ ti@@ ple pur@@ pos@@ es inclu@@ ding agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral land , r@@ ange land or open space ."
"O@@ ver the ocean , it &apos;s not even land ."
"Now if we look at nuclear — ( Laughter ) Wi@@ th nuclear , what do we have ?"
We have fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ies around there . You also have a bu@@ f@@ f@@ er z@@ one that &apos;s 1@@ 7 squ@@ are kilome@@ ters .
And you have the ur@@ ani@@ um min@@ ing that you have to deal with .
"Now if we go to the area , lots is wor@@ se than nuclear or wind ."
"For example , cel@@ lu@@ lo@@ si@@ c e@@ th@@ an@@ ol , to power the entire U.@@ S. ve@@ hi@@ cle f@@ le@@ et , this is how much land you would need ."
"That &apos;s cel@@ lu@@ lo@@ si@@ c , second gener@@ ation bio@@ fu@@ els from pra@@ ir@@ ie gra@@ ss ."
Here &apos;s cor@@ n e@@ th@@ an@@ ol . It &apos;s s@@ mal@@ ler .
"This is based on r@@ ang@@ es from data , but if you look at nuclear , it would be the size of R@@ h@@ od@@ e Is@@ land to power the U.@@ S. ve@@ hi@@ cle f@@ le@@ et ."
"For wind , there &apos;s a lar@@ ger area , but much s@@ mal@@ ler fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int ."
"And of course , with wind , you could put it all over the E@@ ast Co@@ ast , of@@ f@@ sh@@ ore the@@ ore@@ ti@@ cally , or you can sp@@ li@@ t it up ."
"And now , if you go back to looking at ge@@ o@@ ther@@ mal , it &apos;s even s@@ mal@@ ler than both , and solar is sli@@ gh@@ tly lar@@ ger than the nuclear sp@@ ac@@ ing , but it &apos;s still pretty small ."
And this is to power the entire U.@@ S. ve@@ hi@@ cle f@@ le@@ et .
"To power the entire world with 50 percent wind , you would need about one percent of world land ."
"M@@ at@@ ching the reli@@ ability , b@@ ase lo@@ ad is actually ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant ."
We want to mat@@ ch the h@@ our@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ hour power su@@ pp@@ ly .
You can do that by com@@ b@@ ining r@@ ene@@ wa@@ b@@ les .
"This is from real data in C@@ alifor@@ nia , looking at wind data and solar data ."
And it consi@@ ders just using ex@@ ist@@ ing hy@@ d@@ r@@ o to mat@@ ch the h@@ our@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ hour power de@@ m@@ and .
Here are the world wind re@@ sources .
There &apos;s five to 10 times more wind available wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de than we need for all the world .
So then here &apos;s the fin@@ al ran@@ king .
And one last sli@@ de I just want to show . This is the cho@@ ice : You can either have wind or nuclear .
"If you use wind , you gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e ice will last ."
"N@@ u@@ clear , the time la@@ g alone will al@@ low the Ar@@ cti@@ c to me@@ l@@ t and other places to me@@ l@@ t more ."
"And we can gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e a cle@@ an , blue sk@@ y or an un@@ certain future with nuclear power ."
( Applause ) CA : All right .
So while they &apos;re having their com@@ e@@ bac@@ ks on each other — and y@@ ours is sli@@ gh@@ tly shor@@ t because you sli@@ gh@@ tly over@@ ran — I need two people from either side .
"So if you &apos;re for this , if you &apos;re for nuclear power , put up two h@@ ands ."
"If you &apos;re against , put up one ."
And I want two of each for the mi@@ cs .
"Now then , you guys have — you have a minu@@ te com@@ e@@ back on him to pi@@ ck up a point he said , challen@@ ge it , whatever ."
"S@@ B : I think a point of difference we &apos;re having , Mar@@ k , has to do with we@@ apo@@ ns and energy ."
"These di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms that show that nuclear is some@@ how pu@@ tting out a lot of gre@@ en@@ house g@@ ases — a lot of those stud@@ ies inclu@@ de , &quot; &quot; Well of course war will be in@@ evi@@ table and ther@@ e@@ fore we &apos;ll have cities bur@@ ning and stuff like that , &quot; &quot; which is kind of fin@@ ess@@ ing it a little bit , I think ."
"The re@@ ality is that there &apos;s , what , 2@@ 1 n@@ ations that have nuclear power ?"
"O@@ f those , seven have nuclear we@@ apo@@ ns ."
"In every case , they got the we@@ apo@@ ns before they got the nuclear power ."
"There are two n@@ ations , Nor@@ th Kore@@ a and Is@@ ra@@ el , that have nuclear we@@ apo@@ ns and don &apos;t have nuclear power at all ."
"The places that we would most like to have really cle@@ an energy oc@@ cu@@ r are China , Indi@@ a , Europ@@ e , Nor@@ th America , all of which have sor@@ ted out their situ@@ ation in rel@@ ation to nuclear we@@ apo@@ ns ."
"So that lea@@ ves a couple of places like I@@ ran , maybe V@@ ene@@ zu@@ el@@ a , that you would like to have very close sur@@ ve@@ il@@ l@@ ance of anything that goes on with fi@@ s@@ si@@ le stuff ."
"P@@ us@@ h@@ ing a@@ head with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fi@@ s@@ si@@ le materi@@ al is , and we can move tow@@ ard zer@@ o we@@ apo@@ ns left , once we know all that ."
"CA : Mar@@ k , 30 secon@@ ds , either on that or on anything Ste@@ war@@ t said ."
"M@@ J : Well we know Indi@@ a and P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an had nuclear energy first , and then they develo@@ ped nuclear we@@ apo@@ ns se@@ cre@@ tly in the fac@@ tor@@ ies ."
"So the other thing is , we don &apos;t need nuclear energy ."
There &apos;s pl@@ en@@ ty of solar and wind .
"You can make it reli@@ able , as I show@@ ed with that di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m ."
That &apos;s from real data .
And this is an on@@ going research . This is not ro@@ ck@@ et science .
"S@@ ol@@ ving the world &apos;s problems can be done , if you really put your mind to it and use cle@@ an , r@@ ene@@ wa@@ ble energy ."
There &apos;s absolu@@ tely no need for nuclear power .

"My jour@@ ney as an arti@@ st started from a very , very per@@ s@@ onal place ."
I did not start to make social com@@ ment@@ ary about my country .
The first one that you see in front of you is actually when I first re@@ turned to I@@ ran after being se@@ par@@ ated for a good 12 years .
It was after the Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c R@@ ev@@ olution of 19@@ 7@@ 9 .
"W@@ hi@@ le I was ab@@ s@@ ent from I@@ ran , the Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c R@@ ev@@ olution had des@@ cen@@ ded on I@@ ran and had enti@@ re@@ ly trans@@ form@@ ed the country from P@@ er@@ si@@ an to the Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c culture ."
I came ma@@ in@@ ly to be re@@ uni@@ ted with my family and to re@@ conne@@ ct in a way that I found my place in the society .
"But instead , I found a country that was tot@@ ally ide@@ ologi@@ cal and that I didn &apos;t re@@ cogni@@ ze any@@ more ."
"M@@ ore so , I became very interested , as I was fac@@ ing my own per@@ s@@ onal di@@ le@@ m@@ m@@ as and questions , I became im@@ mer@@ sed in the study of the Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c R@@ ev@@ olution — how , in@@ de@@ ed , it had incredi@@ bly trans@@ form@@ ed the lives of I@@ rani@@ an women ."
"I found the sub@@ je@@ ct of I@@ rani@@ an women im@@ men@@ se@@ ly interesting , in the way the women of I@@ ran , histori@@ cally , seem@@ ed to em@@ body the poli@@ tical trans@@ form@@ ation ."
"So in a way , by stu@@ dy@@ ing a woman , you can read the structure and the ide@@ o@@ logy of the country ."
"So I made a group of work that at once fac@@ ed my own per@@ s@@ onal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a lar@@ ger di@@ sc@@ our@@ se — the sub@@ je@@ ct of mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom , the question of those who wil@@ lin@@ g@@ ly stand in that inter@@ se@@ ction of love of God , fai@@ th , but violence and cri@@ me and c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty ."
"For me , this became incredi@@ bly important ."
"And yet , I had an un@@ usu@@ al posi@@ tion tow@@ ard this ."
"I was an out@@ si@@ der who had come back to I@@ ran to find my place , but I was not in a posi@@ tion to be cri@@ tical of the government or the ide@@ o@@ logy of the Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c R@@ ev@@ olution ."
This changed s@@ low@@ ly as I found my vo@@ ice and I disco@@ vered things that I didn &apos;t know I would disco@@ ver .
So my art became sli@@ gh@@ tly more cri@@ tical .
My k@@ ni@@ fe became a little sh@@ ar@@ per .

"My ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion with this book , and the reason I made this into a film , is because it at once was ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sing the question of being a fe@@ m@@ ale — tra@@ di@@ tion@@ ally , histori@@ cally in I@@ ran — and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change , fre@@ e@@ dom and de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y — while the country of I@@ ran , equ@@ ally , as if another char@@ ac@@ ter , also stru@@ gg@@ led for an idea of fre@@ e@@ dom and de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y and in@@ depen@@ dence from the fore@@ ig@@ n inter@@ ven@@ tions ."
I made this film because I felt it &apos;s important for it to speak to the W@@ est@@ er@@ n@@ ers about our history as a country .
That all of you se@@ em to remember I@@ ran after the Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c R@@ ev@@ olution .
"That I@@ ran was once a se@@ cular society , and we had de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y , and this de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y was sto@@ le@@ n from us by the American government , by the Bri@@ ti@@ sh government ."
"This film also spe@@ ak@@ s to the I@@ rani@@ an people in as@@ king them to re@@ turn to their history and look at themselves before they were so Is@@ l@@ ami@@ ci@@ zed — in the way we looked , in the way we pla@@ yed music , in the way we had in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al life ."
"And most of all , in the way that we f@@ ou@@ ght for de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y ."
These are some of the sh@@ ots actually from my film .
These are some of the images of the cou@@ p .
"And we made this film in C@@ as@@ ab@@ lan@@ ca , re@@ cre@@ ating all the sh@@ ots ."
"This film tr@@ ied to find a bal@@ ance between tel@@ ling a poli@@ tical story , but also a fe@@ min@@ ine story ."
"Be@@ ing a vi@@ su@@ al arti@@ st , in@@ de@@ ed , I am fore@@ most interested to make art — to make art that tran@@ scen@@ ds poli@@ ti@@ cs , religi@@ on , the question of fe@@ min@@ is@@ m , and become an important , ti@@ me@@ less , uni@@ vers@@ al work of art ."
The challen@@ ge I have is how to do that .
How to tell a poli@@ tical story but an al@@ leg@@ ori@@ cal story .
"H@@ ow to move you with your emoti@@ ons , but also make your mind work ."
These are some of the images and the char@@ ac@@ ters of the film .
"Now comes the green movement — the sum@@ m@@ er of 200@@ 9 , as my film is rele@@ as@@ ed — the u@@ pri@@ sing begin@@ s in the stre@@ ets of T@@ e@@ h@@ ran ."
"What is un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably i@@ ro@@ nic is the per@@ i@@ od that we tr@@ ied to de@@ pi@@ ct in the film , the c@@ ry for de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y and social ju@@ sti@@ ce , re@@ pe@@ ats itself now again in T@@ e@@ h@@ ran ."
The green movement sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ tly inspi@@ red the world .
It brought a lot of at@@ ten@@ tion to all those I@@ rani@@ ans who stand for basi@@ c human ri@@ ghts and stru@@ gg@@ le for de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y .
"What was most sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant for me was , once again , the pre@@ sen@@ ce of the women ."
They &apos;re absolu@@ tely in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ational for me .
"If in the Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c R@@ ev@@ olution , the images of the woman por@@ tra@@ yed were sub@@ mis@@ sive and didn &apos;t have a vo@@ ice , now we saw a new idea of fe@@ min@@ is@@ m in the stre@@ ets of T@@ e@@ h@@ ran — women who were edu@@ c@@ ated , forward thinking , n@@ on-@@ tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal , se@@ x@@ u@@ ally open , fe@@ ar@@ less and seri@@ ously fe@@ min@@ i@@ st ."
"These women and those young men uni@@ ted I@@ rani@@ ans across the world , inside and outside ."
I then disco@@ vered why I take so much in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation from I@@ rani@@ an women .
"That , under all cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces , they have p@@ us@@ h@@ ed the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary ."
They have con@@ fron@@ ted the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty .
They have bro@@ k@@ en every ru@@ le in the s@@ mal@@ l@@ est and the bi@@ ggest way .
"And once again , they pro@@ ved themselves ."
"I stand here to say that I@@ rani@@ an women have found a new vo@@ ice , and their vo@@ ice is gi@@ ving me my vo@@ ice ."
"And it &apos;s a great hon@@ or to be an I@@ rani@@ an woman and an I@@ rani@@ an arti@@ st , even if I have to oper@@ ate in the W@@ est only for now ."
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
Let &apos;s talk about what scale looks like at T@@ wit@@ ter .
"J@@ an@@ u@@ ary 20@@ 14 , more than 500 million ."
"That &apos;s a 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 9@@ 0@@ 0-@@ percent incre@@ ase ."
There &apos;s no ri@@ sk inv@@ olved .
My job is to ro@@ ot out and pre@@ v@@ ent acti@@ vity that might .
"S@@ oun@@ ds stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward , right ?"
"You might even think it &apos;d be e@@ asy , given that I just said the v@@ ast maj@@ ori@@ ty of acti@@ vity on T@@ wit@@ ter pu@@ ts no one in har@@ m &apos;s way ."
Why spend so much time sear@@ ching for poten@@ tial cal@@ am@@ it@@ ies in in@@ no@@ cu@@ ous acti@@ vi@@ ties ?
S@@ ay 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9 percent of t@@ wee@@ ts pos@@ e no ri@@ sk to any@@ one .
There &apos;s no thre@@ at inv@@ olved .
"A@@ f@@ ter you take out that 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9 percent , that t@@ iny per@@ cent@@ age of t@@ wee@@ ts re@@ ma@@ ining works out to rou@@ gh@@ ly 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 per mon@@ th ."
The sh@@ e@@ er scale of what we &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with makes for a challen@@ ge .
Pe@@ ople do we@@ ird things .
"( Laughter ) And I have to figure out what they &apos;re doing , why , and whether or not there &apos;s ri@@ sk inv@@ olved , often without much in terms of con@@ te@@ xt or back@@ ground ."
The de@@ ta@@ il@@ s have been changed to prote@@ ct the in@@ no@@ cent and sometimes the gu@@ il@@ ty .
We &apos;ll start off e@@ asy .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o bi@@ t@@ ch &quot; &quot; &#93; If you saw a T@@ we@@ et that only said this , you might think to yourself , &quot; That looks like ab@@ use . &quot;"
"A@@ f@@ ter all , why would you want to re@@ cei@@ ve the mess@@ age , &quot; Y@@ o , bi@@ t@@ ch . &quot;"
"Now , I try to st@@ ay relati@@ vely hi@@ p to the lat@@ est tr@@ en@@ ds and me@@ mes , so I knew that &quot; &quot; y@@ o , bi@@ t@@ ch &quot; &quot; was also often a common gre@@ e@@ ting between friends , as well as being a popul@@ ar &quot; &quot; B@@ re@@ aking B@@ ad &quot; &quot; re@@ fer@@ ence ."
I will ad@@ m@@ it that I did not expe@@ ct to en@@ coun@@ ter a f@@ our@@ th use case .
It turns out it is also used on T@@ wit@@ ter when people are ro@@ le@@ -@@ playing as do@@ gs .
"( Laughter ) And in fact , in that case , it &apos;s not only not ab@@ u@@ sive , it &apos;s techni@@ cally just an ac@@ cur@@ ate gre@@ e@@ ting . ( Laughter )"
Let &apos;s look at sp@@ am .
Se@@ em@@ s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward .
We should just au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally s@@ us@@ p@@ end ac@@ coun@@ ts eng@@ ag@@ ing in this kind of behavi@@ or .
T@@ ur@@ ns out there &apos;s some ex@@ cep@@ tions to that ru@@ le .
O@@ kay . Let &apos;s make the st@@ ak@@ es high@@ er .
"B@@ ack to my ac@@ coun@@ t , again ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ ting clas@@ si@@ c behavi@@ or ."
"This is often indi@@ c@@ ative of something called phi@@ sh@@ ing , somebody trying to ste@@ al another person &apos;s ac@@ coun@@ t information by dire@@ cting them to another we@@ b@@ site ."
That &apos;s pretty c@@ lear@@ ly not a good thing .
"We want to , and do , s@@ us@@ p@@ end ac@@ coun@@ ts eng@@ ag@@ ing in that kind of behavi@@ or ."
So why are the st@@ ak@@ es high@@ er for this ?
"Well , this could also be a by@@ stan@@ der at a r@@ ally who man@@ aged to recor@@ d a video of a poli@@ ce offi@@ cer be@@ ating a n@@ on-@@ viol@@ ent prote@@ ster who &apos;s trying to let the world know what &apos;s happening ."
We don &apos;t want to g@@ am@@ ble on poten@@ ti@@ ally si@@ len@@ cing that c@@ ru@@ cial spe@@ e@@ ch by clas@@ si@@ f@@ ying it as sp@@ am and s@@ us@@ pen@@ ding it .
"Now , given the sor@@ ts of challen@@ ges I &apos;m up against , it &apos;s c@@ ru@@ cial that I not only pre@@ di@@ ct but also design prote@@ ctions for the u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted ."
So what do I do ?
"I pa@@ use and I think , how could all of this go hor@@ ri@@ bly wrong ?"
I vi@@ su@@ ali@@ ze cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ he .
"( Laughter ) But you still have to do it , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly if you &apos;re mar@@ ry@@ ing 500 million t@@ wee@@ ts per day ."
Wh@@ ich happens to be my next example .
"This is my c@@ at , E@@ li ."
We wanted to give us@@ ers the ability to ad@@ d ph@@ ot@@ os to their t@@ wee@@ ts .
There &apos;s all sor@@ ts of great things you can do by ad@@ ding a ph@@ oto to a t@@ we@@ et .
My job isn &apos;t to think of those .
It &apos;s to think of what could go wrong .
How could this picture le@@ ad to my death ?
"Well , here &apos;s one possi@@ bility ."
There &apos;s more in that picture than just a c@@ at .
There &apos;s ge@@ od@@ ata .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s not .
"The v@@ ast maj@@ ori@@ ty of inter@@ ac@@ tions I see — and I see a lot , believe me — are posi@@ tive , people re@@ ach@@ ing out to help or to conne@@ ct or share information with each other ."
"It &apos;s just that for those of us de@@ al@@ ing with scale , for those of us t@@ asked with ke@@ e@@ ping people sa@@ fe , we have to as@@ su@@ me the wor@@ st will happen , because for us , a one@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ million ch@@ ance is pretty good od@@ ds ."
"You know , what I do is write for children , and I &apos;m probably America &apos;s most wi@@ de@@ ly read children &apos;s au@@ th@@ or , in fact ."
And I always tell people that I don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scienti@@ st .
"You can have me as a farm@@ er , or in lea@@ thers , and no one has ever cho@@ se farm@@ er ."
I &apos;m here today to talk to you about cir@@ cles and epi@@ ph@@ an@@ ies .
"And you know , an epi@@ ph@@ any is usu@@ ally something you find that you dro@@ pped some@@ place ."
You &apos;ve just got to go around the blo@@ ck to see it as an epi@@ ph@@ any .
That &apos;s a pain@@ ting of a cir@@ cle .
A friend of m@@ ine did that — Ri@@ ch@@ ard B@@ ol@@ lin@@ g@@ bro@@ ke .
It &apos;s the kind of comp@@ lic@@ ated cir@@ cle that I &apos;m going to tell you about .
"My cir@@ cle began back in the &apos; 6@@ 0s in high school in St@@ ow , O@@ hi@@ o where I was the clas@@ s qu@@ e@@ er ."
"I was the guy be@@ at@@ en up blo@@ ody every week in the bo@@ ys &apos; room , until one teach@@ er sa@@ ved my life ."
She sa@@ ved my life by le@@ tting me go to the ba@@ th@@ room in the teach@@ ers &apos; l@@ oun@@ ge .
She did it in se@@ cre@@ t .
She did it for three years .
And I had to get out of tow@@ n .
"I had a th@@ um@@ b , I had 8@@ 5 dollars , and I en@@ ded up in S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co , C@@ alifor@@ nia — met a lo@@ ver — and back in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , found it ne@@ cess@@ ary to beg@@ in work on AIDS organiz@@ ations ."
"A@@ b@@ out three or four years ago , I got a phone call in the mi@@ ddle of the night from that teach@@ er , M@@ r@@ s. P@@ ost@@ en , who said , &quot; &quot; I need to see you ."
I &apos;m disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ted that we never got to know each other as ad@@ ul@@ ts .
"C@@ ould you ple@@ ase come to O@@ hi@@ o , and ple@@ ase bring that man that I know you have found by now ."
"And I should men@@ tion that I have pan@@ cre@@ atic can@@ cer , and I &apos;d like you to ple@@ ase be qui@@ ck about this . &quot; &quot; Well , the next day we were in C@@ le@@ v@@ el@@ and ."
"We took a look at her , we l@@ augh@@ ed , we c@@ ried , and we knew that she needed to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce ."
"We found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and wat@@ ched over her family , because it was ne@@ cess@@ ary ."
It &apos;s something we knew how to do .
"And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an ad@@ ul@@ t got to know me , she turned into a box of ash@@ es and was plac@@ ed in my h@@ ands ."
"And what had happened was the cir@@ cle had clo@@ sed , it had become a cir@@ cle — and that epi@@ ph@@ any I tal@@ ked about pre@@ sen@@ ted itself ."
The epi@@ ph@@ any is that death is a part of life .
She sa@@ ved my life ; I and my part@@ ner sa@@ ved h@@ ers .
"And you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does ."
"It needs tru@@ th and beau@@ ty , and I &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been men@@ tion@@ ed so much here today ."
"It also needs — it needs di@@ gni@@ ty , love and ple@@ as@@ ure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out ."
Thank you .

"For me , this story begin@@ s about 15 years ago , when I was a ho@@ spi@@ ce do@@ ctor at the Uni@@ versity of Chi@@ ca@@ go ."
And I was taking care of people who were dy@@ ing and their fam@@ il@@ ies in the S@@ outh S@@ i@@ de of Chi@@ ca@@ go .
And I was obser@@ ving what happened to people and their fam@@ il@@ ies over the course of their ter@@ min@@ al il@@ l@@ ness .
"And in my la@@ b , I was stu@@ dy@@ ing the wi@@ dow@@ er effe@@ ct , which is a very old idea in the social scien@@ ces , going back 1@@ 50 years , known as &quot; &quot; dy@@ ing of a bro@@ k@@ en heart . &quot; &quot; So , when I die , my wi@@ fe &apos;s ri@@ sk of death can d@@ ou@@ ble , for in@@ stance , in the first year ."
"And I had gone to take care of one particular patien@@ t , a woman who was dy@@ ing of de@@ men@@ ti@@ a ."
"And in this case , un@@ like this couple , she was being car@@ ed for by her d@@ aughter ."
And the d@@ aughter was ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ed from car@@ ing for her mother .
"And the d@@ aughter &apos;s h@@ us@@ b@@ and , he also was si@@ ck from his wi@@ fe &apos;s ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sti@@ on ."
"And I was dri@@ ving home one day , and I get a phone call from the h@@ us@@ b@@ and &apos;s friend , cal@@ ling me because he was de@@ pres@@ sed about what was happening to his friend ."
So here I get this call from this ran@@ dom guy that &apos;s having an experience that &apos;s being in@@ flu@@ en@@ ced by people at some social di@@ stance .
"And so I sud@@ den@@ ly realized two very simple things : F@@ ir@@ st , the wi@@ dow@@ ho@@ od effe@@ ct was not re@@ stri@@ cted to h@@ us@@ b@@ ands and wi@@ ves ."
"And second , it was not re@@ stri@@ cted to pa@@ ir@@ s of people ."
"And I started to see the world in a whole new way , like pa@@ ir@@ s of people conne@@ cted to each other ."
And then I realized that these individu@@ als would be conne@@ cted into f@@ our@@ som@@ es with other pa@@ ir@@ s of people ne@@ ar@@ by .
"And then , in fact , these people were em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in other sor@@ ts of relation@@ ships : mar@@ ri@@ age and spo@@ us@@ al and frien@@ d@@ ship and other sor@@ ts of ties ."
"And that , in fact , these conne@@ ctions were v@@ ast and that we were all em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in this bro@@ ad set of conne@@ ctions with each other ."
So I started to see the world in a completely new way and I became ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with this .
"I became ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with how it might be that we &apos;re em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in these social net@@ works , and how they af@@ fe@@ ct our lives ."
"So , social net@@ works are these in@@ tri@@ cate things of beau@@ ty , and they &apos;re so el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate and so comple@@ x and so u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous , in fact , that one has to ask what pur@@ pos@@ e they ser@@ ve ."
Why are we em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in social net@@ works ?
"I mean , how do they form ? How do they oper@@ ate ?"
And how do they effe@@ ct us ?
"So my first top@@ ic with re@@ spe@@ ct to this , was not death , but obe@@ sity ."
"It had become tr@@ en@@ dy to speak about the &quot; &quot; obe@@ sity epi@@ demi@@ c . &quot; &quot; And , along with my col@@ labor@@ ator , J@@ am@@ es F@@ ow@@ ler , we began to won@@ der whether obe@@ sity really was epi@@ demi@@ c and could it sp@@ read from person to person like the four people I di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed ear@@ lie@@ r ."
So this is a sli@@ de of some of our ini@@ tial resul@@ ts .
"It &apos;s 2@@ ,@@ 2@@ 00 people in the year 2@@ 000 ."
E@@ very do@@ t is a person . We make the do@@ t size pro@@ por@@ ti@@ onal to people &apos;s body size ; so bi@@ g@@ ger d@@ ots are bi@@ g@@ ger people .
"In ad@@ di@@ tion , if your body size , if your B@@ M@@ I , your body mas@@ s in@@ de@@ x , is ab@@ o@@ ve 30 — if you &apos;re c@@ lini@@ cally ob@@ ese — we also co@@ lo@@ red the d@@ ots y@@ el@@ low ."
"So , if you look at this image , right away you might be able to see that there are clu@@ st@@ ers of ob@@ ese and n@@ on-@@ ob@@ ese people in the image ."
But the vi@@ su@@ al comple@@ x@@ ity is still very high .
It &apos;s not obvi@@ ous exactly what &apos;s going on .
"In ad@@ di@@ tion , some questions are im@@ medi@@ ately ra@@ is@@ ed : How much clu@@ ster@@ ing is there ?"
Is there more clu@@ ster@@ ing than would be du@@ e to ch@@ ance alone ?
How big are the clu@@ st@@ ers ? How far do they re@@ ach ?
"And , most import@@ an@@ tly , what ca@@ uses the clu@@ st@@ ers ?"
So we did some ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs to study the size of these clu@@ st@@ ers .
"This here shows , on the Y@@ -@@ ax@@ is , the incre@@ ase in the prob@@ ability that a person is ob@@ ese given that a social cont@@ act of the@@ ir@@ s is ob@@ ese and , on the X@@ -@@ ax@@ is , the de@@ gre@@ es of se@@ par@@ ation between the two people ."
"O@@ n the far left , you see the pur@@ ple line ."
"It says that , if your friends are ob@@ ese , your ri@@ sk of obe@@ sity is 4@@ 5 percent high@@ er ."
"And the next b@@ ar over , the &#91; red &#93; line , says if your friend &apos;s friends are ob@@ ese , your ri@@ sk of obe@@ sity is 25 percent high@@ er ."
"And then the next line over says if your friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friend , someone you probably don &apos;t even know , is ob@@ ese , your ri@@ sk of obe@@ sity is 10 percent high@@ er ."
And it &apos;s only when you get to your friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends that there &apos;s no longer a relation@@ ship between that person &apos;s body size and your own body size .
"Well , what might be ca@@ using this clu@@ ster@@ ing ?"
"There are at least three possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies : One possi@@ bility is that , as I ga@@ in we@@ ight , it ca@@ uses you to ga@@ in we@@ ight ."
"A kind of indu@@ ction , a kind of sp@@ read from person to person ."
"A@@ no@@ ther possi@@ bility , very obvi@@ ous , is hom@@ op@@ hi@@ ly , or , bir@@ ds of a fe@@ a@@ ther flo@@ ck together ; here , I form my t@@ ie to you because you and I share a si@@ mi@@ lar body size ."
"And the last possi@@ bility is what is known as con@@ f@@ oun@@ ding , because it con@@ f@@ oun@@ ds our ability to figure out what &apos;s going on ."
"And here , the idea is not that my we@@ ight ga@@ in is ca@@ using your we@@ ight ga@@ in , no@@ r that I pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally form a t@@ ie with you because you and I share the same body size , but rather that we share a common ex@@ pos@@ ure to something , like a health c@@ lub that makes us both lo@@ se we@@ ight at the same time ."
"When we stud@@ ied these data , we found evi@@ dence for all of these things , inclu@@ ding for indu@@ ction ."
"And we found that if your friend be@@ comes ob@@ ese , it incre@@ ases your ri@@ sk of obe@@ sity by about 5@@ 7 percent in the same given time per@@ i@@ od ."
"There can be many mechani@@ s@@ ms for this effe@@ ct : One possi@@ bility is that your friends say to you something like — you know , they ad@@ op@@ t a behavi@@ or that sp@@ re@@ ads to you — like , they say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go have mu@@ f@@ fin@@ s and be@@ er , &quot; &quot; which is a terri@@ ble com@@ bin@@ ation . ( Laughter ) But you ad@@ op@@ t that com@@ bin@@ ation , and then you start ga@@ ining we@@ ight like them ."
"A@@ no@@ ther more sub@@ tle possi@@ bility is that they start ga@@ ining we@@ ight , and it chang@@ es your ideas of what an ac@@ cep@@ table body size is ."
"H@@ ere , what &apos;s sp@@ re@@ ading from person to person is not a behavi@@ or , but rather a nor@@ m : A@@ n idea is sp@@ re@@ ading ."
"Now , he@@ ad@@ line wri@@ ters had a fie@@ ld day with our stud@@ ies ."
"I think the he@@ ad@@ line in The New York T@@ im@@ es was , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you pac@@ king it on ?"
"B@@ l@@ ame your f@@ at friends . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) What was interesting to us is that the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an he@@ ad@@ line wri@@ ters had a different take : They said , &quot; A@@ re your friends ga@@ ining we@@ ight ? P@@ er@@ haps you are to bl@@ ame . &quot; ( Laughter )"
"And we thought this was a very interesting com@@ ment on America , and a kind of self-@@ ser@@ ving , &quot; &quot; not my respon@@ si@@ bility &quot; &quot; kind of ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on ."
"Now , I want to be very clear : We do not think our work should or could ju@@ sti@@ fy pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce against people of one or another body size at all ."
O@@ ur next questions was : C@@ ould we actually vi@@ su@@ ali@@ ze this sp@@ read ?
W@@ as we@@ ight ga@@ in in one person actually sp@@ re@@ ading to we@@ ight ga@@ in in another person ?
"And this was comp@@ lic@@ ated because we needed to take into ac@@ coun@@ t the fact that the network structure , the archite@@ cture of the ties , was chang@@ ing across time ."
"In ad@@ di@@ tion , because obe@@ sity is not a uni@@ cent@@ ri@@ c epi@@ demi@@ c , there &apos;s not a P@@ at@@ ien@@ t Z@@ er@@ o of the obe@@ sity epi@@ demi@@ c — if we find that guy , there was a sp@@ read of obe@@ sity out from him — it &apos;s a mul@@ ti@@ cent@@ ri@@ c epi@@ demi@@ c ."
L@@ ots of people are doing things at the same time .
And I &apos;m about to show you a 30 second video anim@@ ation that took me and J@@ am@@ es five years of our lives to do .
"So , again , every do@@ t is a person ."
E@@ very t@@ ie between them is a relation@@ ship .
"We &apos;re going to put this into moti@@ on now , taking da@@ i@@ ly cu@@ ts through the network for about 30 years ."
"The do@@ t si@@ z@@ es are going to gro@@ w , you &apos;re going to see a se@@ a of y@@ el@@ low take over ."
"You &apos;re going to see people be born and die — d@@ ots will ap@@ pe@@ ar and disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar — ties will form and bre@@ ak , mar@@ ri@@ ages and di@@ v@@ or@@ ces , frien@@ dings and de@@ frien@@ dings ."
"A lot of comple@@ x@@ ity , a lot is happening just in this 3@@ 0-@@ year per@@ i@@ od that inclu@@ des the obe@@ sity epi@@ demi@@ c ."
"And , by the end , you &apos;re going to see clu@@ st@@ ers of ob@@ ese and n@@ on-@@ ob@@ ese individu@@ als within the network ."
"Now , when looked at this , it changed the way I see things , because this thing , this network that &apos;s chang@@ ing across time , it has a memor@@ y , it mo@@ ves , things f@@ low within it , it has a kind of consi@@ st@@ en@@ cy — people can die , but it doesn &apos;t die ; it still per@@ si@@ sts — and it has a kind of re@@ sil@@ ience that allow@@ s it to per@@ si@@ st across time ."
"And so , I came to see these kinds of social net@@ works as living things , as living things that we could put under a kind of micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e to study and an@@ al@@ y@@ ze and understand ."
And we used a v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of techni@@ qu@@ es to do this .
And we started expl@@ or@@ ing all kinds of other ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a .
"We looked at smo@@ king and d@@ r@@ in@@ king behavi@@ or , and v@@ ot@@ ing behavi@@ or , and di@@ v@@ or@@ ce — which can sp@@ read — and al@@ tru@@ is@@ m ."
"And , ev@@ en@@ tually , we became interested in emoti@@ ons ."
"Now , when we have emoti@@ ons , we show them ."
Why do we show our emoti@@ ons ?
"I mean , there would be an adv@@ an@@ t@@ age to exper@@ ien@@ cing our emoti@@ ons inside , you know , ang@@ er or happ@@ iness ."
"But we don &apos;t just experience them , we show them ."
"And not only do we show them , but others can read them ."
"And , not only can they read them , but they cop@@ y them ."
There &apos;s emoti@@ onal cont@@ ag@@ i@@ on that takes place in human popul@@ ations .
"And so this fun@@ ction of emoti@@ ons su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that , in ad@@ di@@ tion to any other pur@@ pos@@ e they ser@@ ve , they &apos;re a kind of pri@@ mi@@ tive form of communi@@ cation ."
"And that , in fact , if we really want to understand human emoti@@ ons , we need to think about them in this way ."
"Now , we &apos;re ac@@ cu@@ st@@ om@@ ed to thinking about emoti@@ ons in this way , in simple , sort of , br@@ ie@@ f per@@ i@@ ods of time ."
"So , for example , I was gi@@ ving this talk re@@ cent@@ ly in New York C@@ ity , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know when you &apos;re on the sub@@ way and the other person across the sub@@ way car s@@ miles at you , and you just in@@ st@@ in@@ cti@@ vely smi@@ le back ? &quot; &quot; And they looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t do that in New York C@@ ity . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ where else in the world , that &apos;s nor@@ mal human behavi@@ or . &quot; &quot; And so there &apos;s a very in@@ st@@ in@@ ctive way in which we br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly trans@@ m@@ it emoti@@ ons to each other ."
"And , in fact , emoti@@ onal cont@@ ag@@ i@@ on can be bro@@ a@@ der still ."
"L@@ i@@ ke we could have pun@@ ctu@@ ated ex@@ pres@@ sions of ang@@ er , as in ri@@ ots ."
"The question that we wanted to ask was : C@@ ould emoti@@ on sp@@ read , in a more susta@@ ined way than ri@@ ots , across time and inv@@ ol@@ ve large num@@ bers of people , not just this pa@@ ir of individu@@ als smi@@ ling at each other in the sub@@ way car ?"
"M@@ a@@ ybe there &apos;s a kind of be@@ low the surface , qu@@ ie@@ t ri@@ ot that ani@@ mat@@ es us all the time ."
Ma@@ ybe there are emoti@@ onal st@@ am@@ pe@@ des that ri@@ pp@@ le through social net@@ works .
"M@@ a@@ ybe , in fact , emoti@@ ons have a colle@@ ctive ex@@ ist@@ ence , not just an individu@@ al ex@@ ist@@ ence ."
And this is one of the first images we made to study this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
"A@@ ga@@ in , a social network , but now we color the people y@@ el@@ low if they &apos;re happy and blue if they &apos;re sa@@ d and green in between ."
"And if you look at this image , you can right away see clu@@ st@@ ers of happy and un@@ happy people , again , sp@@ re@@ ading to three de@@ gre@@ es of se@@ par@@ ation ."
And you might form the in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion that the un@@ happy people oc@@ cu@@ py a different stru@@ ctu@@ ral lo@@ cation within the network .
"There &apos;s a mi@@ ddle and an ed@@ ge to this network , and the un@@ happy people se@@ em to be lo@@ c@@ ated at the ed@@ ges ."
"So to inv@@ o@@ ke another me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or , if you imagine social net@@ works as a kind of v@@ ast f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of hum@@ ani@@ ty — I &apos;m conne@@ cted to you and you to her , on out en@@ d@@ l@@ ess@@ ly into the di@@ stance — this f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c is actually like an ol@@ d-@@ fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ed American qu@@ il@@ t , and it has pat@@ ch@@ es on it : happy and un@@ happy pat@@ ch@@ es ."
And whether you become happy or not depen@@ ds in part on whether you oc@@ cu@@ py a happy pat@@ ch .
"( Laughter ) So , this work with emoti@@ ons , which are so fundam@@ ent@@ al , then got us to thinking about : Ma@@ ybe the fundam@@ ent@@ al ca@@ uses of human social net@@ works are some@@ how en@@ c@@ od@@ ed in our gen@@ es ."
"Because human social net@@ works , wh@@ en@@ ever they are ma@@ pped , always kind of look like this : the picture of the network ."
But they never look like this .
Why do they not look like this ?
Why don &apos;t we form human social net@@ works that look like a regu@@ lar lat@@ ti@@ ce ?
"Well , the stri@@ king pat@@ ter@@ ns of human social net@@ works , their u@@ bi@@ qui@@ ty and their ap@@ par@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ e be@@ g questions about whether we ev@@ olved to have human social net@@ works in the first place , and whether we ev@@ olved to form net@@ works with a particular structure ."
"And noti@@ ce first of all — so , to understand this , though , we need to dis@@ se@@ ct network structure a little bit first — and noti@@ ce that every person in this network has exactly the same stru@@ ctu@@ ral lo@@ cation as every other person ."
But that &apos;s not the case with real net@@ works .
"So , for example , here is a real network of colle@@ ge students at an e@@ li@@ te nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n uni@@ versity ."
And now I &apos;m high@@ li@@ gh@@ ting a few d@@ ots .
"If you look here at the d@@ ots , comp@@ are no@@ de B in the u@@ pp@@ er left to no@@ de D in the far right ; B has four friends coming out from him and D has six friends coming out from him ."
"And so , those two individu@@ als have different num@@ bers of friends ."
"That &apos;s very obvi@@ ous , we all know that ."
But certain other aspe@@ cts of social network structure are not so obvi@@ ous .
C@@ om@@ p@@ are no@@ de B in the u@@ pp@@ er left to no@@ de A in the low@@ er left .
"Now , those people both have four friends , but A &apos;s friends all know each other , and B &apos;s friends do not ."
"So the friend of a friend of A &apos;s is , back again , a friend of A &apos;s , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the friend of a friend of B &apos;s is not a friend of B &apos;s , but is far@@ ther away in the network ."
This is known as tran@@ si@@ ti@@ vity in net@@ works .
"And , finally , comp@@ are no@@ des C and D : C and D both have six friends ."
"If you talk to them , and you said , &quot; &quot; What is your social life like ? &quot; &quot; they would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got six friends ."
"That &apos;s my social experience . &quot; &quot; But now we , with a bir@@ d &apos;s ey@@ e view looking at this network , can see that they oc@@ cu@@ py very different social wor@@ l@@ ds ."
And I can cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ate that in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion in you by just as@@ king you : Wh@@ o would you rather be if a de@@ ad@@ ly ger@@ m was sp@@ re@@ ading through the network ?
W@@ ould you rather be C or D ?
"You &apos;d rather be D , on the ed@@ ge of the network ."
"And now who would you rather be if a ju@@ i@@ cy piece of go@@ s@@ si@@ p — not about you — was sp@@ re@@ ading through the network ? ( Laughter ) Now , you would rather be C@@ ."
So different stru@@ ctu@@ ral lo@@ c@@ ations have different im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations for your life .
"And , in fact , when we did some experim@@ ents looking at this , what we found is that 4@@ 6 percent of the v@@ ari@@ ation in how many friends you have is expla@@ ined by your gen@@ es ."
And this is not sur@@ pri@@ sing . We know that some people are born sh@@ y and some are born gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous . That &apos;s obvi@@ ous .
But we also found some n@@ on-@@ obvi@@ ous things .
"For in@@ stance , 4@@ 7 percent in the v@@ ari@@ ation in whether your friends know each other is at@@ tri@@ bu@@ table to your gen@@ es ."
"W@@ he@@ ther your friends know each other has not just to do with their gen@@ es , but with y@@ ours ."
And we think the reason for this is that some people like to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce their friends to each other — you know who you are — and others of you keep them a@@ part and don &apos;t in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce your friends to each other .
"And so some people k@@ ni@@ t together the net@@ works around them , cre@@ ating a kind of den@@ se we@@ b of ties in which they &apos;re comfor@@ t@@ ably em@@ be@@ d@@ ded ."
"And finally , we even found that 30 percent of the v@@ ari@@ ation in whether or not people are in the mi@@ ddle or on the ed@@ ge of the network can also be at@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted to their gen@@ es ."
So whether you find yourself in the mi@@ ddle or on the ed@@ ge is also parti@@ ally h@@ eri@@ table .
"Now , what is the point of this ?"
How does this help us understand ? How does this help us
figure out some of the problems that are af@@ fe@@ cting us these days ?
"Well , the ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent I &apos;d like to make is that net@@ works have val@@ ue ."
They are a kind of social ca@@ pi@@ tal .
"N@@ e@@ w pro@@ per@@ ties em@@ er@@ ge because of our em@@ be@@ d@@ de@@ d@@ ness in social net@@ works , and these pro@@ per@@ ties in@@ here in the structure of the net@@ works , not just in the individu@@ als within them ."
So think about these two common obje@@ cts .
"They &apos;re both made of car@@ b@@ on , and yet one of them has car@@ b@@ on at@@ oms in it that are ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ed in one particular way — on the left — and you get gra@@ phi@@ te , which is so@@ ft and dar@@ k ."
"But if you take the same car@@ b@@ on at@@ oms and inter@@ conne@@ ct them a different way , you get di@@ am@@ ond , which is clear and hard ."
"And those pro@@ per@@ ties of so@@ f@@ t@@ ness and har@@ d@@ ness and dar@@ k@@ ness and c@@ lear@@ ness do not re@@ side in the car@@ b@@ on at@@ oms ; they re@@ side in the inter@@ conne@@ ctions between the car@@ b@@ on at@@ oms , or at least ari@@ se because of the inter@@ conne@@ ctions between the car@@ b@@ on at@@ oms ."
"So , si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ly , the pat@@ ter@@ n of conne@@ ctions am@@ ong people con@@ f@@ ers upo@@ n the grou@@ ps of people different pro@@ per@@ ties ."
It is the ties between people that makes the whole gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of its par@@ ts .
"And so it is not just what &apos;s happening to these people — whether they &apos;re lo@@ sing we@@ ight or ga@@ ining we@@ ight , or be@@ coming ri@@ ch or be@@ coming po@@ or , or be@@ coming happy or not be@@ coming happy — that af@@ fe@@ cts us ; it &apos;s also the ac@@ tu@@ al archite@@ cture of the ties around us ."
O@@ ur experience of the world depen@@ ds on the ac@@ tu@@ al structure of the net@@ works in which we &apos;re resi@@ ding and on all the kinds of things that ri@@ pp@@ le and f@@ low through the network .
"Now , the reason , I think , that this is the case is that human be@@ ings as@@ se@@ m@@ ble themselves and form a kind of super@@ organi@@ sm ."
"Now , a super@@ organi@@ sm is a colle@@ ction of individu@@ als which show or ev@@ in@@ ce behavi@@ ors or ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a that are not redu@@ ci@@ ble to the study of individu@@ als and that must be under@@ sto@@ od by re@@ fer@@ ence to , and by stu@@ dy@@ ing , the colle@@ ctive ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , for example , a hi@@ ve of bees that &apos;s fin@@ ding a new ne@@ st@@ ing site , or a flo@@ ck of bir@@ ds that &apos;s ev@@ ading a pre@@ d@@ ator , or a flo@@ ck of bir@@ ds that &apos;s able to po@@ ol its wi@@ s@@ dom and na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate and find a t@@ iny spe@@ ck of an is@@ land in the mi@@ ddle of the P@@ aci@@ fic , or a p@@ ack of wol@@ ves that &apos;s able to bring down lar@@ ger pre@@ y ."
Su@@ per@@ organi@@ s@@ ms have pro@@ per@@ ties that cannot be under@@ sto@@ od just by stu@@ dy@@ ing the individu@@ als .
"I think under@@ standing social net@@ works and how they form and oper@@ ate can help us understand not just health and emoti@@ ons but all kinds of other ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a — like cri@@ me , and war@@ f@@ are , and economic ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a like b@@ ank ru@@ ns and market c@@ ra@@ sh@@ es and the ad@@ op@@ tion of in@@ no@@ vation and the sp@@ read of produ@@ ct ad@@ op@@ tion ."
"Now , look at this ."
I think we form social net@@ works because the b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts of a conne@@ cted life out@@ we@@ i@@ gh the co@@ sts .
"If I was always viol@@ ent towar@@ ds you or gave you mis@@ information or made you sa@@ d or in@@ fe@@ cted you with de@@ ad@@ ly ger@@ ms , you would cut the ties to me , and the network would dis@@ inte@@ gr@@ ate ."
So the sp@@ read of good and val@@ u@@ able things is requi@@ red to susta@@ in and n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh social net@@ works .
"S@@ imi@@ lar@@ ly , social net@@ works are requi@@ red for the sp@@ read of good and val@@ u@@ able things , like love and kin@@ d@@ ness and happ@@ iness and al@@ tru@@ is@@ m and ideas ."
"I think , in fact , that if we realized how val@@ u@@ able social net@@ works are , we &apos;d spend a lot more time n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing them and susta@@ ining them , because I think social net@@ works are fundam@@ ent@@ ally re@@ lated to go@@ od@@ ness ."
And what I think the world needs now is more conne@@ ctions .

There are 3@@ 9 million people in the world who are bl@@ ind .

Let me show you some images of what I consi@@ der to be the cities of tom@@ or@@ row .
"So , that &apos;s K@@ i@@ b@@ era , the largest squ@@ at@@ ter community in Na@@ i@@ robi ."
"This is the squ@@ at@@ ter community in S@@ an@@ j@@ ay G@@ and@@ h@@ i N@@ ational Par@@ k in B@@ om@@ b@@ ay , Indi@@ a , what &apos;s called M@@ um@@ ba@@ i these days ."
"This is H@@ os@@ in@@ ia , the largest and most urb@@ ani@@ zed fa@@ v@@ el@@ a in Ri@@ o de J@@ an@@ e@@ ir@@ o ."
"And this is S@@ ul@@ tan@@ be@@ ly@@ i , which is one of the largest squ@@ at@@ ter communi@@ ties in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l ."
"They are what I consi@@ der to be the cities of tom@@ or@@ row , the new urb@@ an world ."
"Now , why do I say that ?"
"To tell you about that I have to talk about this fel@@ low here , his name is Ju@@ li@@ us ."
And I met Ju@@ li@@ us the last week that I was living in K@@ i@@ b@@ era .
"So , I had been there almost three months , and I was t@@ our@@ ing around the city going to different squ@@ at@@ ter are@@ as and Ju@@ li@@ us was t@@ ag@@ g@@ ing along , and he was bu@@ g ey@@ ed and at certain poin@@ ts we were wal@@ king around , he gra@@ b@@ bed my hand for sup@@ port , which is something most Ken@@ y@@ ans would never consi@@ der doing ."
They &apos;re very poli@@ te and they don &apos;t get so forward so quickly .
"And I found out later that it was Ju@@ li@@ us &apos; first day in Na@@ i@@ robi , and he &apos;s one of many ."
"So , close to 200@@ ,000 people a day mi@@ gr@@ ate from the ru@@ ral to the urb@@ an are@@ as ."
"That &apos;s , and I &apos;m going to be fa@@ ir to the st@@ ati@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans who tal@@ ked this morning , not almost 1@@ .@@ 5 million people a week , but almost 1@@ .@@ 4 million people a week but I &apos;m a jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st , and we ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate , so almost 1@@ .@@ 5 million people a week , close to 70 million people a year ."
"And if you do the mat@@ h , that &apos;s 1@@ 30 people every minu@@ te ."
"So , that &apos;ll be — in the 18 minutes that I &apos;m given to talk here , between two and three thous@@ and people will have jour@@ ne@@ yed to the cities ."

But it sto@@ od in j@@ ar@@ ring con@@ tra@@ st to something Ar@@ m@@ stron@@ g had said as we were e@@ ating — that he tre@@ as@@ u@@ red the qu@@ ality of life in his neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od .
"&quot; &quot; F@@ or Ar@@ m@@ stron@@ g , S@@ ou@@ th@@ land wasn &apos;t con@@ stra@@ ined by its materi@@ al con@@ di@@ tions ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , the human sp@@ ir@@ it radi@@ ated out from the me@@ tal wal@@ ls and gar@@ b@@ age he@@ ap@@ s to of@@ f@@ er something no leg@@ al neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od could : fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"@@ &apos;@@ This place is very ad@@ di@@ ctive , &apos; he had said ."
"@@ &apos;@@ It &apos;s a simple life , but no@@ body is re@@ stri@@ cting you ."
N@@ ob@@ ody is contro@@ l@@ ling what you do .
"O@@ n@@ ce you have sta@@ yed here , you cannot go back . &apos; He me@@ ant back be@@ y@@ ond that m@@ oun@@ tain of tra@@ sh , back in the leg@@ al city , of leg@@ al buil@@ dings , with leg@@ al le@@ ases and leg@@ al ri@@ ghts ."
"@@ &apos;@@ O@@ n@@ ce you have sta@@ yed here , &apos; he said , &apos; you can st@@ ay for the rest of your life . &apos; &quot; &quot; So , he has hope , and this is where these communi@@ ties start ."
"This is per@@ haps the most pri@@ mi@@ tive sh@@ an@@ ty that you can find in K@@ i@@ b@@ era , little more than a sti@@ ck@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ mu@@ d hu@@ t next to a gar@@ b@@ age he@@ a@@ p ."
"This is getting ready for the mon@@ so@@ on in B@@ om@@ b@@ ay , Indi@@ a ."
This is home impro@@ v@@ ement : pu@@ tting pla@@ stic tar@@ ps on your ro@@ of .
"This is in Ri@@ o de J@@ an@@ e@@ ir@@ o , and it &apos;s getting a bit better , right ?"
"We &apos;re seeing s@@ ca@@ ven@@ g@@ ed ter@@ ra c@@ ot@@ ta ti@@ le and little pie@@ ces of sig@@ ns , and pla@@ ster over the bri@@ ck , some color , and this is S@@ ul@@ ay M@@ on@@ tak@@ a@@ ya &apos;s house in S@@ ul@@ tan@@ be@@ ly@@ i , and it &apos;s getting even better ."
He &apos;s got a f@@ ence ; he s@@ ca@@ ven@@ g@@ ed a door ; he &apos;s got new ti@@ le on the ro@@ of .
And then you get Ro@@ cin@@ h@@ a and you can see that it &apos;s getting even better .
The buil@@ dings here are mul@@ ti@@ -@@ story .
"They develo@@ p — you can see on the far right one where it seem@@ s to just st@@ ack on top of each other , room , after room , after room ."
"And what people do is they develo@@ p their home on one or two stories , and they se@@ ll their log@@ gi@@ a or ro@@ of ri@@ ghts , and someone else buil@@ ds on top of their building , and then that person sel@@ ls the ro@@ of ri@@ ghts , and someone else buil@@ ds on top of their building ."
All of these buil@@ dings are made out of re@@ in@@ for@@ ced con@@ cre@@ te and bri@@ ck .
"And then you get S@@ ul@@ tan@@ be@@ ly@@ i , in T@@ ur@@ key , where it &apos;s even built to a high@@ er level of design ."
"The c@@ ru@@ d in the front is mat@@ tre@@ ss stu@@ f@@ f@@ ing , and you see that all over T@@ ur@@ key ."
Pe@@ ople d@@ ry out or air out their mat@@ tre@@ ss stu@@ f@@ f@@ ing on their ro@@ of@@ s .
"But the green building , on behind , you can see that the top flo@@ or is not oc@@ cu@@ pie@@ d , so people are building with the possi@@ bility of ex@@ pan@@ sion ."
And it &apos;s built to a pretty high stan@@ d@@ ard of design .
"And then you finally get squ@@ at@@ ter hom@@ es like this , which is built on the su@@ bur@@ b@@ an model ."
"H@@ ey , that &apos;s a single family home in the squ@@ at@@ ter community ."
"That &apos;s also in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , T@@ ur@@ key ."
"They &apos;re quite vi@@ tal places , these communi@@ ties ."
"This is the ma@@ in dra@@ g of Ro@@ cin@@ h@@ a , the E@@ stra@@ da da G@@ a@@ ve@@ a , and there &apos;s a bu@@ s rou@@ te that ru@@ ns through it , lots of people out on the stre@@ et ."
These communi@@ ties in these cities are actually more vi@@ tal than the il@@ leg@@ al communi@@ ties .
They have more things going on in them .
This is a ty@@ pi@@ cal pa@@ th@@ way in Ro@@ cin@@ h@@ a called a &quot; &quot; be@@ co &quot; &quot; — these are how you get around the community .
It &apos;s on very ste@@ ep ground .
"They &apos;re built on the h@@ il@@ ls , in@@ land from the be@@ ach@@ es in Ri@@ o , and you can see that the h@@ ous@@ es are just can@@ ti@@ le@@ vered over the natural ob@@ stru@@ ctions ."
"So , that &apos;s just a ro@@ ck in the h@@ il@@ l@@ side ."
"And these be@@ co@@ s are nor@@ m@@ ally very c@@ row@@ ded , and people hum@@ p f@@ ur@@ ni@@ ture up them , or ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ at@@ ors up them , all sor@@ ts of things ."
Be@@ er is all car@@ ried in on your sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders .
Be@@ er is a very important thing in B@@ raz@@ il .
"This is comm@@ er@@ ce in Ken@@ ya , right along the tra@@ in trac@@ ks , so close to the tra@@ in trac@@ ks that the mer@@ ch@@ an@@ ts sometimes have to pu@@ ll the mer@@ ch@@ an@@ di@@ se out of the way ."
"This is a marke@@ t@@ place , also in Ken@@ ya , T@@ o@@ i Mar@@ k@@ et , lots of de@@ al@@ ers , in almost everything you want to bu@@ y ."
Th@@ ose green things in the fore@@ ground are man@@ goes .
"This is a sh@@ op@@ ping stre@@ et in K@@ i@@ b@@ era , and you can see that there &apos;s a s@@ od@@ a de@@ al@@ er , a health c@@ lin@@ ic , two beau@@ ty s@@ al@@ ons , a b@@ ar , two gro@@ cer@@ y sto@@ res , and a ch@@ ur@@ ch , and more ."
It &apos;s a ty@@ pi@@ cal dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n stre@@ et ; it just happens to be self-@@ built .
"This here , on the ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side , is what &apos;s called a — if you look at the f@@ ine pr@@ int under the aw@@ ning — it &apos;s a hot@@ el ."
"And what hot@@ el means , in Ken@@ ya and Indi@@ a , is an e@@ at@@ ing@@ -@@ place ."
"So , that &apos;s a re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant ."
Pe@@ ople ste@@ al electri@@ cal power — this is Ri@@ o .
"P@@ e@@ ople ta@@ p in and they have th@@ ie@@ ves who are called &quot; &quot; g@@ ri@@ l@@ lo@@ s &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; cri@@ c@@ ke@@ ts , &quot; &quot; and they ste@@ al the electri@@ cal power and wi@@ re the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
"P@@ e@@ ople bur@@ n tra@@ sh to get ri@@ d of the gar@@ b@@ age , and they di@@ g their own se@@ wer ch@@ an@@ ne@@ ls ."
T@@ al@@ k about more pla@@ stic b@@ ag@@ s than plan@@ kt@@ on .
And sometimes they have natural tra@@ sh@@ -@@ di@@ spos@@ al .
"And when they have more money they c@@ ement their stre@@ ets , and they put in se@@ w@@ ers and good water pi@@ p@@ es , and stuff like that ."
"This is water going to Ri@@ o . Pe@@ ople run their water pi@@ p@@ es all over the place , and that little hu@@ t right there has a pu@@ m@@ p in it , and that &apos;s what people do : they ste@@ al electri@@ city ; they in@@ st@@ all a pu@@ m@@ p and they ta@@ p into the water ma@@ in , and pu@@ m@@ p water up to their h@@ ous@@ es ."
"So , the question is how do you go from the mu@@ d-@@ hu@@ t vi@@ ll@@ age , to the more develo@@ ped city , to the even high@@ ly develo@@ ped S@@ ul@@ tan@@ be@@ ly@@ i ?"
I say there are two things .
One is people need a gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e they won &apos;t be evi@@ cted .
"That does not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly mean pro@@ per@@ ty ri@@ ghts , and I would dis@@ ag@@ ree with H@@ er@@ n@@ an@@ do de S@@ oto on that question , because pro@@ per@@ ty ri@@ ghts create a lot of comp@@ lic@@ ations ."
"They &apos;re most often s@@ old to people , and people then wind up in de@@ b@@ t and have to pay back the de@@ b@@ t , and sometimes have to se@@ ll their pro@@ per@@ ty in order to pay back the de@@ b@@ t ."
"There &apos;s a whole v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of other reas@@ ons why pro@@ per@@ ty ri@@ ghts sometimes don &apos;t work in these c@@ ases , but they do need secu@@ ri@@ ty of ten@@ ure ."
"And they need ac@@ cess to poli@@ ti@@ cs , and that can mean two things ."
"That can mean community organiz@@ ing from be@@ low , but it can also mean possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies from ab@@ o@@ ve ."
And I say that because the system in T@@ ur@@ key is not@@ able .
T@@ ur@@ key has two great l@@ aw@@ s that prote@@ ct squ@@ at@@ ters .
"One is that — it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; ge@@ ce@@ kon@@ d@@ u &quot; &quot; in T@@ ur@@ k@@ is@@ h , which means &quot; &quot; built over@@ night , &quot; &quot; and if you build your house over@@ night in T@@ ur@@ key , you can &apos;t be evi@@ cted without du@@ e process of la@@ w , if they don &apos;t cat@@ ch you during the night ."
"And the second aspe@@ ct is that once you have 2@@ ,000 people in the community , you can pe@@ ti@@ tion the government to be re@@ cogni@@ zed as a leg@@ al sub@@ -@@ muni@@ ci@@ p@@ ality ."
"And when you &apos;re a leg@@ al sub@@ -@@ muni@@ ci@@ p@@ ality , you sud@@ den@@ ly have poli@@ ti@@ cs ."
"You &apos;re allow@@ ed to have an ele@@ cted government , colle@@ ct ta@@ x@@ es , provi@@ de muni@@ ci@@ p@@ al ser@@ vi@@ ces , and that &apos;s exactly what they do ."
"So , these are the ci@@ vi@@ c le@@ ad@@ ers of the future ."
The woman in the cen@@ ter is G@@ e@@ e@@ ta J@@ i@@ wa .
She lives in one of those t@@ ents on the high@@ way medi@@ an in M@@ um@@ ba@@ i .
That &apos;s Su@@ re@@ ka G@@ un@@ d@@ i ; she also lives with her family on the t@@ ent along the same high@@ way medi@@ an .
They &apos;re very out@@ spo@@ k@@ en . They &apos;re very ac@@ tive .
They can be community le@@ ad@@ ers .
"This woman is N@@ ine , which means &quot; &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; in T@@ ur@@ k@@ is@@ h ."
"And there were three old l@@ ad@@ ies who li@@ ved in — that &apos;s her self-@@ built house behind her — and they &apos;ve li@@ ved there for 30 or 40 years , and they are the back@@ b@@ one of the community there ."
"This is Ri@@ ch@@ ard Mu@@ th@@ ama Pe@@ ter , and he is an it@@ in@@ er@@ ant stre@@ et photograph@@ er in K@@ i@@ b@@ era ."
"He makes money taking pi@@ ctures of the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od , and the people in the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od , and is a great re@@ source in the community ."
"And finally my cho@@ ice to run for ma@@ y@@ or of Ri@@ o is C@@ e@@ z@@ ini@@ o , the f@@ ru@@ it mer@@ ch@@ ant with his two kids here , and a more hon@@ est and gi@@ ving and car@@ ing man I don &apos;t know ."
The future of these communi@@ ties is in the people and in our ability to work with those people .
"So , I think the mess@@ age I take , from what I read from the book , from what Ar@@ m@@ stron@@ g said , and from all these people , is that these are neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods ."
The issue is not urb@@ an po@@ ver@@ ty .
"The issue is not the lar@@ ger , over@@ -@@ ar@@ ching thing ."
"The issue is for us to re@@ cogni@@ ze that these are neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods — this is a le@@ gi@@ ti@@ m@@ ate form of urb@@ an develo@@ pment — and that cities have to eng@@ age these resi@@ d@@ ents , because they are building the cities of the future ."
Thank you very much .
Sy@@ d@@ ney . I had been wai@@ ting my whole life to get to Sy@@ d@@ ney .
"I got to the air@@ port , to the hot@@ el , che@@ cked in , and , sitting there in the lob@@ by , was a bro@@ ch@@ ure for the Sy@@ d@@ ney F@@ esti@@ v@@ al . I th@@ um@@ bed through it , and I came across a show called &quot; &quot; M@@ into : Li@@ ve . &quot; &quot; The descri@@ ption read : &quot; &quot; The su@@ bur@@ b@@ an stre@@ ets of M@@ into become the st@@ age for perform@@ an@@ ces created by inter@@ national arti@@ sts in col@@ labor@@ ation with the people of M@@ into . &quot; &quot; What was this place called M@@ into ?"
"S@@ y@@ d@@ ney , as I would learn , is a city of su@@ bur@@ b@@ s , and M@@ into l@@ ies s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est , about an hour away ."
"I have to say , it wasn &apos;t exactly what I had in mind for my first day down under ."
"I mean , I &apos;d thought about the H@@ ar@@ b@@ our Bri@@ dge or B@@ on@@ d@@ i Be@@ ach , but M@@ into ? But still , I &apos;m a produ@@ cer , and the lu@@ re of a si@@ te@@ -@@ speci@@ fic the@@ ater project was more than I could resi@@ st . ( Laughter ) So , off I went into F@@ ri@@ day af@@ ter@@ no@@ on traf@@ fic , and I &apos;ll never for@@ get what I saw when I got there ."
"For the perform@@ ance , the audience wal@@ ked around the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od from house to house , and the resi@@ d@@ ents , who were the perform@@ ers , they came out of their h@@ ous@@ es , and they perform@@ ed these au@@ t@@ ob@@ i@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal dan@@ ces on their l@@ aw@@ ns , on their dri@@ ve@@ ways . ( Laughter ) The show is a col@@ labor@@ ation with a U.@@ K@@ .@@ -@@ based perform@@ ance company called L@@ one T@@ wi@@ n ."
"L@@ one T@@ wi@@ n had come to M@@ into and worked with the resi@@ d@@ ents , and they had created these dan@@ ces ."
"This Au@@ str@@ ali@@ an@@ -@@ Indi@@ an girl , she came out and started to dance on her front l@@ aw@@ n , and her father pe@@ er@@ ed out the win@@ do@@ w to see what all the no@@ ise and comm@@ oti@@ on was about , and he so@@ on jo@@ ined her ."
And he was fol@@ low@@ ed by her little si@@ ster .
"And so@@ on they were all dan@@ cing this jo@@ y@@ ous , ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant dance right there on their l@@ aw@@ n . ( Laughter ) And as I wal@@ ked through the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od , I was amaz@@ ed and I was mo@@ ved by the incredible sense of ow@@ ner@@ ship this community c@@ lear@@ ly felt about this ev@@ ent ."
"&quot; &quot; M@@ into : Li@@ ve &quot; &quot; brought Sy@@ d@@ ne@@ ysi@@ ders into di@@ al@@ og@@ ue with inter@@ national arti@@ sts , and really ce@@ le@@ br@@ ated the di@@ versity of Sy@@ d@@ ney on its own terms ."
The Sy@@ d@@ ney F@@ esti@@ v@@ al which produ@@ ced &quot; &quot; M@@ into : Li@@ ve &quot; &quot; I think re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts a new kind of 2@@ 1@@ st@@ -@@ century ar@@ ts fe@@ sti@@ v@@ al .
These fe@@ sti@@ v@@ als are radi@@ cally open .
They can trans@@ form cities and communi@@ ties .
"To understand this , I think it kind of makes sense to look where we &apos;ve come from ."
M@@ od@@ er@@ n ar@@ ts fe@@ sti@@ v@@ als were born in the ru@@ b@@ ble of World W@@ ar I@@ I .
C@@ i@@ vi@@ c le@@ ad@@ ers created these an@@ nu@@ al ev@@ ents to ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate culture as the high@@ est ex@@ pres@@ sion of the human sp@@ ir@@ it .
"In 19@@ 4@@ 7 , the E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh F@@ esti@@ v@@ al was born and A@@ vi@@ gn@@ on was born and hundre@@ ds of others would fol@@ low in their wa@@ ke ."
"The work they did was very , very high art , and star@@ s came along like L@@ au@@ r@@ ie An@@ der@@ son and M@@ er@@ ce C@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ha@@ m and Rob@@ er@@ t Le@@ p@@ age who made work for this cir@@ cu@@ it , and you had these se@@ min@@ al shows like &quot; &quot; The Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ har@@ ata &quot; &quot; and the mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al &quot; &quot; E@@ inste@@ in on the Be@@ ach . &quot; &quot; But as the de@@ ca@@ des pas@@ sed , these fe@@ sti@@ v@@ als , they really became the est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment , and as the culture and ca@@ pi@@ tal ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated , the Inter@@ net brought us all together , high and low kind of disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ared , a new kind of fe@@ sti@@ v@@ al em@@ er@@ g@@ ed ."
"The old fe@@ sti@@ v@@ als , they contin@@ u@@ ed to th@@ ri@@ ve , but from Bri@@ gh@@ ton to Ri@@ o to P@@ er@@ th , something new was em@@ er@@ g@@ ing , and these fe@@ sti@@ v@@ als were really different ."
"They &apos;re open , these fe@@ sti@@ v@@ als , because , like in M@@ into , they understand that the di@@ al@@ og@@ ue between the local and the global is essen@@ tial ."
"They &apos;re open because they ask the audience to be a pla@@ y@@ er , a pro@@ t@@ ag@@ oni@@ st , a part@@ ner , rather than a pas@@ sive spe@@ ct@@ ator , and they &apos;re open because they know that imag@@ in@@ ation cannot be con@@ ta@@ ined in buil@@ dings , and so much of the work they do is si@@ te@@ -@@ speci@@ fic or out@@ door work ."
"So , the new fe@@ sti@@ v@@ al , it as@@ ks the audience to play an essen@@ tial ro@@ le in sha@@ ping the perform@@ ance ."
"C@@ om@@ pan@@ ies like D@@ e L@@ a G@@ u@@ ar@@ da , which I produ@@ ce , and P@@ un@@ ch@@ dru@@ n@@ k create these completely im@@ mer@@ sive exper@@ ien@@ ces that put the audience at the cen@@ ter of the action , but the G@@ er@@ man perform@@ ance company R@@ im@@ in@@ i Pro@@ to@@ kol@@ l takes this all to a whole new level ."
"In a ser@@ ies of shows that inclu@@ des &quot; &quot; 100 P@@ er@@ cent V@@ an@@ cou@@ ver , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 P@@ er@@ cent B@@ er@@ li@@ n , &quot; &quot; R@@ im@@ in@@ i Pro@@ to@@ kol@@ l makes shows that actually ref@@ le@@ ct society ."
"R@@ im@@ in@@ i Pro@@ to@@ kol@@ l cho@@ os@@ es 100 people that re@@ present that city at that moment in terms of rac@@ e and gen@@ der and clas@@ s , through a car@@ e@@ ful process that begin@@ s three months before , and then those 100 people share stories about themselves and their lives , and the whole thing be@@ comes a s@@ na@@ p@@ sh@@ ot of that city at that moment ."
L@@ I@@ F@@ T has always been a pi@@ one@@ er in the use of ven@@ u@@ es .
They understand that the@@ ater and perform@@ ance can happen any@@ where .
"You can do a show in a scho@@ ol@@ room , in an air@@ port , — ( Laughter ) — in a de@@ part@@ ment stor@@ e win@@ do@@ w ."
Ar@@ ti@@ sts are expl@@ or@@ ers . Wh@@ o better to show us the city an@@ e@@ w ?
"A@@ r@@ ti@@ sts can take us to a far@@ -@@ flu@@ n@@ g part of the city that we ha@@ ven &apos;t ex@@ plo@@ red , or they can take us into that building that we pas@@ s every day but we never went into ."
"A@@ n arti@@ st , I think , can really show us people that we might over@@ look in our lives ."
B@@ ack to B@@ ack is an Au@@ str@@ ali@@ an company of people with in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al dis@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies . I saw their amazing show in New York at the St@@ at@@ en Is@@ land F@@ er@@ ry T@@ er@@ min@@ al at rus@@ h hour .
"We , the audience , were given he@@ ad@@ se@@ ts and se@@ ated on one side of the ter@@ min@@ al ."
"The ac@@ t@@ ors were right there in front of us , right there am@@ ong the com@@ mu@@ ters , and we could hear them , but we might not have o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se seen them ."
So B@@ ack to B@@ ack takes si@@ te@@ -@@ speci@@ fic the@@ ater and uses it to g@@ ently re@@ mind us about who and what we cho@@ ose to ed@@ it out of our da@@ i@@ ly lives .
"So , the di@@ al@@ og@@ ue with the local and the global , the audience as parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ant and pla@@ y@@ er and pro@@ t@@ ag@@ oni@@ st , the in@@ no@@ v@@ ative use of site , all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fanta@@ stic F@@ ren@@ ch company Ro@@ y@@ al de Lu@@ x@@ e ."
Ro@@ y@@ al de Lu@@ x@@ e &apos;s gi@@ ant pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts come into a city and they live there for a few days .
"For &quot; &quot; The S@@ ul@@ t@@ an &apos;s E@@ le@@ ph@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Ro@@ y@@ al de Lu@@ x@@ e came to cent@@ ral Lon@@ don and brought it to a stan@@ d@@ still with their story of a gi@@ ant little girl and her friend , a ti@@ me@@ -@@ tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing ele@@ ph@@ ant ."
"For a few days , they trans@@ form@@ ed a mas@@ sive city into a community where en@@ d@@ less possi@@ bility re@@ ig@@ ned ."
"The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an wro@@ te , &quot; &quot; If art is about trans@@ form@@ ation , then there can be no more trans@@ form@@ ative experience ."
"What &apos; The S@@ ul@@ t@@ an &apos;s E@@ le@@ ph@@ ant &apos; re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts is no less than an arti@@ stic oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ation of the city and a re@@ cl@@ am@@ ation of the stre@@ ets for the people . &quot; &quot; We can talk about the economic impac@@ ts of these fe@@ sti@@ v@@ als on their cities , but I &apos;m much &#91; more &#93; interested in many more things , like how a fe@@ sti@@ v@@ al hel@@ ps a city to ex@@ pre@@ ss itself , how it le@@ ts it come into its own ."
"F@@ esti@@ v@@ als pro@@ mot@@ e di@@ versity , they bring neigh@@ b@@ ors into di@@ al@@ og@@ ue , they incre@@ ase cre@@ ati@@ vity , they of@@ f@@ er opportuni@@ ties for ci@@ vi@@ c pri@@ de , they impro@@ ve our gener@@ al psycho@@ logi@@ cal wel@@ l-@@ being ."
"In shor@@ t , they make cities better places to live ."
"C@@ ase in point : When &quot; &quot; The S@@ ul@@ t@@ an &apos;s E@@ le@@ ph@@ ant &quot; &quot; came to Lon@@ don just n@@ ine months after 7 / 7 , a Lon@@ d@@ on@@ er wro@@ te , &quot; &quot; F@@ or the first time since the Lon@@ don b@@ om@@ b@@ ings , my d@@ aughter called up with that sp@@ ar@@ k@@ le back in her vo@@ ice ."
"S@@ he had ga@@ ther@@ ed with others to wat@@ ch &apos; The S@@ ul@@ t@@ an &apos;s E@@ le@@ ph@@ ant , &apos; and , you know , it just made all the difference . &quot; &quot; L@@ y@@ n G@@ ar@@ d@@ ner in The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an has wri@@ t@@ ten that a great fe@@ sti@@ v@@ al can show us a ma@@ p of the world , a ma@@ p of the city and a ma@@ p of ourselves , but there is no one fi@@ x@@ ed fe@@ sti@@ v@@ al model ."
"I think what &apos;s so bri@@ lli@@ ant about the fe@@ sti@@ v@@ als , the new fe@@ sti@@ v@@ als , is that they are really fully cap@@ tur@@ ing the comple@@ x@@ ity and the exci@@ tem@@ ent of the way we all live today ."
Thank you very much . ( Applause )
Is E@@ .@@ T@@ . out there ?
"Well , I work at the S@@ E@@ T@@ I In@@ stitu@@ te ."
That &apos;s almost my name . S@@ E@@ T@@ I : S@@ ear@@ ch for E@@ x@@ tr@@ at@@ er@@ re@@ stri@@ al In@@ te@@ lli@@ g@@ ence .
"In other words , I look for al@@ ien@@ s , and when I tell people that at a co@@ c@@ kt@@ a@@ il par@@ ty , they usu@@ ally look at me with a mi@@ l@@ d@@ ly incre@@ du@@ l@@ ous look on their face ."
I try to keep my own face some@@ what disp@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ ate .
"Now , a lot of people think that this is kind of ide@@ ali@@ stic , ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , maybe even hop@@ el@@ ess , but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think that the job I have is actually a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge , o@@ kay , and give you a little bit of the moti@@ vation for my getting into this line of work , if that &apos;s what you call it ."
"This thing — wh@@ o@@ op@@ s , can we go back ?"
"H@@ el@@ l@@ o , come in , Earth ."
There we go . All right .
"This is the O@@ wen@@ s V@@ al@@ ley R@@ ad@@ i@@ o O@@ b@@ ser@@ v@@ at@@ ory behind the S@@ ier@@ ra N@@ ev@@ ad@@ as , and in 19@@ 6@@ 8 , I was working there colle@@ cting data for my the@@ sis ."
"Now , it &apos;s kin@@ da lon@@ ely , it &apos;s kin@@ da te@@ di@@ ous , just colle@@ cting data , so I would am@@ use myself by taking ph@@ ot@@ os at night of the tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es or even of myself , because , you know , at night , I would be the only hom@@ in@@ id within about 30 miles ."
So here are pi@@ ctures of myself .
"The obser@@ v@@ at@@ ory had just ac@@ qui@@ red a new book , wri@@ t@@ ten by a R@@ us@@ si@@ an co@@ smo@@ logi@@ st by the name of Jo@@ se@@ ph S@@ h@@ k@@ lo@@ v@@ sk@@ y , and then ex@@ pan@@ ded and trans@@ lated and e@@ di@@ ted by a lit@@ t@@ le@@ -@@ known C@@ or@@ ne@@ ll ast@@ ron@@ om@@ er by the name of C@@ ar@@ l S@@ ag@@ an ."
"And I remember re@@ ading that book , and at 3 in the morning I was re@@ ading this book and it was expla@@ ining how the an@@ ten@@ nas I was using to meas@@ ure the sp@@ ins of gal@@ ax@@ ies could also be used to communi@@ cate , to sen@@ d bi@@ ts of information from one st@@ ar system to another ."
"Now , at 3 o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the morning when you &apos;re all alone , ha@@ ven &apos;t had much sle@@ ep , that was a very ro@@ man@@ tic idea , but it was that idea — the fact that you could in fact pro@@ ve that there &apos;s somebody out there just using this same technology — that ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job at the S@@ E@@ T@@ I In@@ stitu@@ te . Now , I have to say that my memor@@ y is not@@ ori@@ ously po@@ rou@@ s , and I &apos;ve often wonder@@ ed whether there was any tru@@ th in this story , or I was just , you know , mis@@ re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing something , but I re@@ cent@@ ly just b@@ le@@ w up this old neg@@ ative of m@@ ine ,"
"@@ and sure enough , there you can see the S@@ h@@ k@@ lo@@ v@@ sk@@ y and S@@ ag@@ an book under@@ ne@@ ath that an@@ al@@ o@@ g cal@@ cu@@ lat@@ ing de@@ vice ."
So it was true .
"A@@ ll right . Now , the idea for doing this , it wasn &apos;t very old at the time that I made that ph@@ oto ."
"The idea d@@ ates from 19@@ 60 , when a young ast@@ ron@@ om@@ er by the name of Fran@@ k D@@ ra@@ ke used this an@@ ten@@ na in W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , poin@@ ted it at a couple of ne@@ ar@@ by star@@ s in the hop@@ es of e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pping on E@@ .@@ T@@ ."
"Now , Fran@@ k didn &apos;t hear anything ."
"A@@ c@@ tually he did , but it turned out to be the U.@@ S. A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce , which doesn &apos;t coun@@ t as ex@@ tr@@ at@@ er@@ re@@ stri@@ al inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence ."
"But D@@ ra@@ ke &apos;s idea here became very popul@@ ar because it was very ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing — and I &apos;ll get back to that — and on the basi@@ s of this experim@@ ent , which didn &apos;t suc@@ ce@@ ed , we have been doing S@@ E@@ T@@ I ever since , not contin@@ u@@ ously , but ever since ."
We still ha@@ ven &apos;t heard anything . We still ha@@ ven &apos;t heard anything .
"In fact , we don &apos;t know about any life be@@ y@@ ond Earth ,"
"@@ but I &apos;m going to su@@ ggest to you that that &apos;s going to change rather so@@ on , and part of the reason , in fact , the maj@@ ori@@ ty of the reason why I think that &apos;s going to change is that the e@@ qui@@ pment &apos;s getting better ."
"This is the Al@@ le@@ n T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e Ar@@ ra@@ y , about 3@@ 50 miles from whatever se@@ at you &apos;re in right now ."
"This is something that we &apos;re using today to sear@@ ch for E@@ .@@ T@@ . , and the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs have got@@ ten very much better too ."
This is Fran@@ k D@@ ra@@ ke &apos;s ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs in 19@@ 60 .
This is the Al@@ le@@ n T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e Ar@@ ra@@ y ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs today .
"S@@ ome pun@@ d@@ it with too much time on his h@@ ands has re@@ c@@ kon@@ ed that the new experim@@ ents are appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately 100 tri@@ llion times better than they were in 19@@ 60 , 100 tri@@ llion times better ."
"That &apos;s a de@@ gre@@ e of an impro@@ v@@ ement that would look good on your re@@ port car@@ d , o@@ kay ?"
"But something that &apos;s not ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated by the public is , in fact , that the experim@@ ent contin@@ u@@ es to get better , and , con@@ sequ@@ ently , ten@@ ds to get f@@ ast@@ er ."
"This is a little p@@ lot , and every time you show a p@@ lot , you lo@@ se 10 percent of the audience ."
I have 12 of these . ( Laughter ) But what I pl@@ ot@@ ted here is just some me@@ tri@@ c that shows how f@@ ast we &apos;re sear@@ ching .
"In other words , we &apos;re looking for a need@@ le in a ha@@ yst@@ ack ."
We know how big the ha@@ yst@@ ack is . It &apos;s the gal@@ ax@@ y .
"But we &apos;re going through the ha@@ yst@@ ack no longer with a te@@ as@@ po@@ on but with a sk@@ i@@ p lo@@ a@@ der , because of this incre@@ ase in speed ."
"In fact , those of you who are still con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous and ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cally compe@@ t@@ ent , will not@@ e that this is a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g p@@ lot ."
"In other words , the r@@ ate of incre@@ ase is ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ al ."
"It &apos;s ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally impro@@ ving . Now , ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ al is an over@@ worked word . You hear it on the media all the time ."
"They don &apos;t really know what ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ al means , but this is ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ al ."
"In fact , it &apos;s d@@ ou@@ b@@ ling every 18 months , and , of course , every car@@ d-@@ car@@ ry@@ ing member of the di@@ ger@@ at@@ i know@@ s that that &apos;s Mo@@ ore &apos;s L@@ a@@ w ."
"So this means that over the course of the next two do@@ z@@ en years , we &apos;ll be able to look at a million st@@ ar systems , a million st@@ ar systems , looking for sig@@ n@@ als that would pro@@ ve somebody &apos;s out there ."
"Well , a million st@@ ar systems , is that interesting ?"
"I mean , how many of those st@@ ar systems have plane@@ ts ?"
"And the fac@@ ts are , we didn &apos;t know the answer to that even as re@@ cent@@ ly as 15 years ago , and in fact , we really didn &apos;t know it even as re@@ cent@@ ly as six months ago ."
"But now we do . Re@@ cent resul@@ ts su@@ ggest that vi@@ r@@ tually every st@@ ar has plane@@ ts , and more than one ."
"They &apos;re like , you know , k@@ it@@ ten@@ s . You get a lit@@ ter ."
You don &apos;t get one k@@ it@@ ten . You get a bu@@ n@@ ch .
"So in fact , this is a pretty ac@@ cur@@ ate est@@ im@@ ate of the number of plane@@ ts in our gal@@ ax@@ y , just in our gal@@ ax@@ y , by the way , and I re@@ mind the n@@ on-@@ ast@@ ron@@ om@@ y maj@@ ors am@@ ong you that our gal@@ ax@@ y is only one of 100 billion that we can see with our tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es ."
"That &apos;s a lot of real est@@ ate , but of course , most of these plane@@ ts are going to be kind of wor@@ th@@ less , like , you know , M@@ er@@ cu@@ ry , or Ne@@ p@@ tu@@ ne ."
Ne@@ p@@ tu@@ ne &apos;s probably not very big in your life .
"So the question is , what f@@ rac@@ tion of these plane@@ ts are actually su@@ it@@ able for life ?"
"We don &apos;t know the answer to that either , but we will learn that answer this year , th@@ an@@ ks to N@@ A@@ SA &apos;s K@@ e@@ ple@@ r S@@ p@@ ace T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e , and in fact , the s@@ mar@@ t money , which is to say the people who work on this project , the s@@ mar@@ t money is su@@ gg@@ est@@ ing that the f@@ rac@@ tion of plane@@ ts that might be su@@ it@@ able for life is maybe one in a thous@@ and , one in a hundre@@ d , something like that ."
"Well , even taking the p@@ es@@ si@@ mi@@ stic est@@ im@@ ate , that it &apos;s one in a thous@@ and , that means that there are at least a billion cou@@ s@@ ins of the Earth just in our own gal@@ ax@@ y ."
"O@@ kay , now I &apos;ve given you a lot of num@@ bers here , but they &apos;re mo@@ st@@ ly big num@@ bers , o@@ kay , so , you know , keep that in mind . There &apos;s pl@@ en@@ ty of real est@@ ate , pl@@ en@@ ty of real est@@ ate in the universe , and if we &apos;re the only bit of real est@@ ate in which there &apos;s some interesting oc@@ cu@@ pan@@ ts , that makes you a mi@@ rac@@ le , and I know you like to think you &apos;re a mi@@ rac@@ le , but if you do science , you learn rather quickly that every time you think you &apos;re a mi@@ rac@@ le , you &apos;re wrong , so probably not the case ."
"A@@ ll right , so the bot@@ tom line is this : Because of the incre@@ ase in speed , and because of the v@@ ast amount of ha@@ bi@@ table real est@@ ate in the co@@ smo@@ s , I figure we &apos;re going to pi@@ ck up a sig@@ na@@ l within two do@@ z@@ en years ."
"And I feel stron@@ g@@ ly enough about that to make a be@@ t with you : E@@ i@@ ther we &apos;re going to find E@@ .@@ T@@ . in the next two do@@ z@@ en years , or I &apos;ll bu@@ y you a cu@@ p of co@@ f@@ fe@@ e ."
"So that &apos;s not so bad . I mean , even with two do@@ z@@ en years , you open up your b@@ row@@ s@@ er and there &apos;s news of a sig@@ na@@ l , or you get a cu@@ p of co@@ f@@ fe@@ e ."
"Now , let me tell you about some aspe@@ ct of this that people don &apos;t think about , and that is , what happens ? S@@ up@@ pos@@ e that what I say is true ."
"I mean , who know@@ s , but sup@@ pos@@ e it happens ."
S@@ up@@ pos@@ e some time in the next two do@@ z@@ en years we pi@@ ck up a fa@@ int line that tel@@ ls us we have some co@@ smi@@ c company .
What is the effe@@ ct ? What &apos;s the con@@ sequ@@ ence ?
"Now , I might be at ground zer@@ o for this ."
"I happen to know what the con@@ sequ@@ ence for me would be , because we &apos;ve had fal@@ se al@@ ar@@ ms . This is 199@@ 7 , and this is a ph@@ oto I made at about 3 o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the morning in M@@ oun@@ tain V@@ ie@@ w here , when we were wat@@ ching the computer mon@@ it@@ ors because we had pi@@ cked up a sig@@ na@@ l that we thought , &quot; &quot; This is the real deal . &quot; &quot; All right ?"
And I ke@@ pt wai@@ ting for the M@@ en in B@@ l@@ ack to show up . R@@ ight ?
"I ke@@ pt wai@@ ting for — I ke@@ pt wai@@ ting for my mo@@ m to call , somebody to call , the government to call . N@@ ob@@ ody called ."
"N@@ ob@@ ody called . I was so ner@@ v@@ ous that I couldn &apos;t si@@ t down . I just wan@@ der@@ ed around taking ph@@ ot@@ os like this one , just for something to do ."
"Well , at 9 : 30 in the morning , with my head down on my des@@ k because I obvi@@ ously ha@@ dn &apos;t s@@ lep@@ t all night , the phone r@@ ings and it &apos;s The New York T@@ im@@ es ."
"And I think there &apos;s a l@@ es@@ son in that , and that l@@ es@@ son is that if we pi@@ ck up a sig@@ na@@ l , the media , the media will be on it f@@ ast@@ er than a we@@ as@@ el on ball be@@ ar@@ ings . It &apos;s going to be f@@ ast ."
You can be sure of that . No se@@ cre@@ cy .
"That &apos;s what happens to me . It kind of ru@@ ins my whole week , because whatever I &apos;ve got plan@@ ned that week is kind of out the win@@ do@@ w ."
But what about you ? What &apos;s it going to do to you ?
And the answer is that we don &apos;t know the answer .
"We don &apos;t know what that &apos;s going to do to you , not in the long ter@@ m , and not even very much in the shor@@ t ter@@ m ."
"I mean , that would be a bit like as@@ king Ch@@ ris Col@@ um@@ bu@@ s in 1@@ 4@@ 9@@ 1 , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey Ch@@ ris , you know , what happens if it turns out that there &apos;s a contin@@ ent between here and J@@ ap@@ an , where you &apos;re sa@@ il@@ ing to , what will be the con@@ sequ@@ ences for hum@@ ani@@ ty if that turns out to be the case ? &quot; &quot; And I think Ch@@ ris would probably of@@ f@@ er you some answer that you might not have under@@ sto@@ od , but it probably wouldn &apos;t have been right , and I think that to pre@@ di@@ ct what fin@@ ding E@@ .@@ T@@ . &apos; s going to mean , we can &apos;t pre@@ di@@ ct that either ."
But here are a couple things I can say .
"To beg@@ in with , it &apos;s going to be a society that &apos;s way in adv@@ ance of our own ."
You &apos;re not going to hear from al@@ ie@@ n Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als .
They &apos;re not building trans@@ mi@@ t@@ ters .
"They &apos;re going to be a@@ head of us , maybe by a few thous@@ and years , maybe by a few mi@@ llions years , but sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally a@@ head of us , and that means , if you can understand anything that they &apos;re going to say , then you might be able to shor@@ t-@@ cir@@ cu@@ it history by getting information from a society that &apos;s way be@@ y@@ ond our own ."
"Now , you might find that a bit hy@@ per@@ bo@@ li@@ c , and maybe it is , but n@@ one@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s con@@ cei@@ v@@ able that this will happen , and , you know , you could consi@@ der this like , I don &apos;t know , gi@@ ving Ju@@ li@@ us C@@ a@@ es@@ ar En@@ g@@ li@@ sh l@@ ess@@ ons and the key to the li@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gre@@ ss ."
"It would change his day , all right ?"
That &apos;s one thing . A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s for sure going to happen is that it will c@@ ali@@ br@@ ate us .
"We will know that we &apos;re not that mi@@ rac@@ le , right , that we &apos;re just another du@@ ck in a row , we &apos;re not the only kids on the blo@@ ck , and I think that that &apos;s phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ hi@@ cally a very pro@@ found thing to learn ."
"We &apos;re not a mi@@ rac@@ le , o@@ kay ?"
"The third thing that it might tell you is some@@ what v@@ ag@@ ue , but I think interesting and important , and that is , if you find a sig@@ na@@ l coming from a more adv@@ an@@ ced society , because they will be , that will tell you something about our own possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies , that we &apos;re not in@@ evi@@ t@@ ably do@@ om@@ ed to self-@@ de@@ stru@@ ction ."
"Because they survi@@ ved their technology , we could do it too ."
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally when you look out into the universe , you &apos;re looking back in time . All right ?"
That &apos;s interesting to co@@ smo@@ logi@@ sts .
"But in this sense , you actually can look into the future , ha@@ zi@@ ly , but you can look into the future ."
So those are all the sor@@ ts of things that would come from a de@@ te@@ ction .
"Now , let me talk a little bit about something that happens even in the me@@ an@@ time , and that is , S@@ E@@ T@@ I , I think , is important , because it &apos;s expl@@ or@@ ation , and it &apos;s not only expl@@ or@@ ation , it &apos;s com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble expl@@ or@@ ation ."
"Now , I got@@ ta tell you , I &apos;m always re@@ ading boo@@ ks about expl@@ or@@ ers . I find expl@@ or@@ ation very interesting , Ar@@ cti@@ c expl@@ or@@ ation , you know , people like M@@ ag@@ el@@ l@@ an , A@@ mu@@ n@@ d@@ s@@ en , S@@ h@@ ac@@ k@@ le@@ ton , you see Fran@@ kli@@ n down there , S@@ c@@ ot@@ t , all these guys . It &apos;s really ni@@ f@@ ty , expl@@ or@@ ation ."
"And they &apos;re just doing it because they want to expl@@ ore , and you might say , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s kind of a f@@ ri@@ vol@@ ous opportunity , &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not f@@ ri@@ vol@@ ous . That &apos;s not a f@@ ri@@ vol@@ ous acti@@ vity , because , I mean , think of an@@ ts ."
"You know , most an@@ ts are progra@@ m@@ med to fol@@ low one another along in a long line , but there are a couple of an@@ ts , maybe one percent of those an@@ ts , that are what they call pi@@ one@@ er an@@ ts , and they &apos;re the ones that wan@@ der off ."
They &apos;re the ones you find on the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en coun@@ ter@@ top .
You got@@ ta get them with your th@@ um@@ b before they find the su@@ g@@ ar or something .
"But those an@@ ts , even though most of them get wi@@ ped out , those an@@ ts are the ones that are essen@@ tial to the survi@@ v@@ al of the hi@@ ve . So expl@@ or@@ ation is important ."
"I also think that expl@@ or@@ ation is important in terms of being able to ad@@ dre@@ ss what I think is a cri@@ tical l@@ ack in our society , and that is the l@@ ack of science liter@@ acy , the l@@ ack of the ability to even understand science ."
"Now , look , a lot has been wri@@ t@@ ten about the de@@ pl@@ or@@ able state of science liter@@ acy in this country ."
You &apos;ve heard about it .
"Well , here &apos;s one example , in fact ."
"P@@ ol@@ ls taken , this po@@ ll was taken 10 years ago ."
"It shows like rou@@ gh@@ ly one third of the public thin@@ ks that al@@ ien@@ s are not only out there , we &apos;re looking for them out there , but they &apos;re here , right ?"
S@@ ail@@ ing the sk@@ ies in their sa@@ u@@ c@@ ers and oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally ab@@ du@@ cting people for experim@@ ents their parents wouldn &apos;t appro@@ ve of .
"Well , that would be interesting if it was true , and job secu@@ ri@@ ty for me , but I don &apos;t think the evi@@ dence is very good . That &apos;s more , you know , sa@@ d than sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant ."
"But there are other things that people believe that are sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant , like the ef@@ fi@@ c@@ acy of h@@ ome@@ op@@ a@@ th@@ y , or that ev@@ olution is just , you know , sort of a c@@ razy idea by scienti@@ sts without any le@@ gs , or , you know , ev@@ olution , all that sort of thing , or global war@@ ming ."
"These sor@@ ts of ideas don &apos;t really have any v@@ ali@@ di@@ ty , that you can &apos;t tr@@ ust the scienti@@ sts ."
"Now , we &apos;ve got to sol@@ ve that problem , because that &apos;s a cri@@ ti@@ cally important problem , and you might say , &quot; Well , o@@ kay , how are we g@@ on@@ na sol@@ ve that problem with S@@ E@@ T@@ I ? &quot;"
"Well , let me su@@ ggest to you that S@@ E@@ T@@ I obvi@@ ously can &apos;t sol@@ ve the problem , but it can ad@@ dre@@ ss the problem ."
"It can ad@@ dre@@ ss the problem by getting young people interested in science . L@@ ook , science is hard , it has a re@@ pu@@ tation of being hard , and the fac@@ ts are , it is hard , and that &apos;s the resul@@ t of 4@@ 00 years of science , right ?"
"I mean , in the 1@@ 8@@ th century , in the 1@@ 8@@ th century you could become an exper@@ t on any fie@@ ld of science in an af@@ ter@@ no@@ on by going to a li@@ br@@ ary , if you could find the li@@ br@@ ary , right ?"
"In the 19@@ th century , if you had a bas@@ ement la@@ b , you could make major scienti@@ fic disco@@ ver@@ ies in your own home . R@@ ight ? Because there was all this science just l@@ ying around wai@@ ting for somebody to pi@@ ck it up ."
"Now , that &apos;s not true any@@ more ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , you &apos;ve got to spend years in gra@@ d school and post@@ -@@ do@@ c posi@@ tions just to figure out what the important questions are ."
It &apos;s hard . There &apos;s no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t about it .
"And in fact , here &apos;s an example : the H@@ ig@@ gs b@@ os@@ on , fin@@ ding the H@@ ig@@ gs b@@ os@@ on ."
"A@@ sk the next 10 people you see on the stre@@ ets , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , do you think it &apos;s wor@@ th@@ while to spend bi@@ llions of S@@ wi@@ ss f@@ ran@@ cs looking for the H@@ ig@@ gs b@@ os@@ on ? &quot; &quot; And I be@@ t the answer you &apos;re going to get , is , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know what the H@@ ig@@ gs b@@ os@@ on is , and I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s important . &quot; &quot; And probably most of the people wouldn &apos;t even know the val@@ ue of a S@@ wi@@ ss f@@ ran@@ c , o@@ kay ?"
And yet we &apos;re sp@@ ending bi@@ llions of S@@ wi@@ ss f@@ ran@@ cs on this problem .
O@@ kay ? So that doesn &apos;t get people interested in science because they can &apos;t com@@ pre@@ h@@ end what it &apos;s about .
"S@@ E@@ T@@ I , on the other hand , is really simple ."
We &apos;re going to use these big an@@ ten@@ nas and we &apos;re going to try to e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ p on sig@@ n@@ als . E@@ very@@ body can understand that .
"@@ Yes , technologi@@ cally , it &apos;s very s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated , but everybody gets the idea ."
"So that &apos;s one thing . The other thing is , it &apos;s exci@@ ting science ."
"It &apos;s exci@@ ting because we &apos;re natur@@ ally interested in other inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent be@@ ings , and I think that &apos;s part of our har@@ d@@ wi@@ ring ."
"I mean , we &apos;re har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to be interested in be@@ ings that might be , if you will , compe@@ ti@@ t@@ ors , or if you &apos;re the ro@@ man@@ tic sort , possi@@ bly even mat@@ es . O@@ kay ?"
"I mean , this is an@@ al@@ og@@ ous to our inter@@ est in things that have big te@@ e@@ th . R@@ ight ?"
"We &apos;re interested in things that have big te@@ e@@ th , and you can see the ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary val@@ ue of that , and you can also see the prac@@ tical con@@ sequ@@ ences by wat@@ ching A@@ ni@@ mal P@@ lan@@ et ."
You noti@@ ce they make very few progra@@ ms about ger@@ bi@@ ls .
It &apos;s mo@@ st@@ ly about things that have big te@@ e@@ th .
"O@@ kay , so we &apos;re interested in these sor@@ ts of things ."
And not just us . It &apos;s also kids .
"This allow@@ s you to pay it forward by using this sub@@ je@@ ct as a ho@@ ok to science , because S@@ E@@ T@@ I inv@@ ol@@ ves all kinds of science , obvi@@ ously bio@@ logy , obvi@@ ously ast@@ ron@@ om@@ y , but also ge@@ o@@ logy , also chemi@@ stry , v@@ ari@@ ous scienti@@ fic dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ines all can be pre@@ sen@@ ted in the gu@@ ise of , &quot; We &apos;re looking for E@@ .@@ T@@ . &quot;"
"So to me this is interesting and important , and in fact , it &apos;s my poli@@ cy , even though I give a lot of tal@@ ks to ad@@ ul@@ ts , you give tal@@ ks to ad@@ ul@@ ts , and two days later they &apos;re back where they were ."
"But if you give tal@@ ks to kids , you know , one in 50 of them , some light bu@@ l@@ b goes off , and they think , &quot; &quot; G@@ e@@ e , I &apos;d never thought of that , &quot; &quot; and then they go , you know , read a book or a mag@@ az@@ ine or whatever ."
They get interested in something .
"Now it &apos;s my the@@ ory , sup@@ por@@ ted only by an@@ e@@ c@@ dot@@ al , per@@ s@@ onal an@@ e@@ c@@ dot@@ al evi@@ dence , but n@@ one@@ the@@ less , that kids get interested in something between the ages of eight and 11 . You &apos;ve got to get them there ."
"So , all right , I give tal@@ ks to ad@@ ul@@ ts , that &apos;s f@@ ine , but I try and make 10 percent of the tal@@ ks that I give , I try and make those for kids ."
"I remember when a guy came to our high school , actually , it was actually my ju@@ ni@@ or high school . I was in si@@ x@@ th gra@@ de ."
And he gave some talk . All I remember from it was one word : ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs .
"It was like D@@ u@@ st@@ in H@@ of@@ f@@ man in &quot; &quot; The G@@ ra@@ du@@ ate , &quot; &quot; right , when he said &quot; &quot; pla@@ sti@@ cs , &quot; &quot; whatever that means , pla@@ sti@@ cs ."
"A@@ ll right , so the guy said ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs . I don &apos;t remember anything else . In fact , I don &apos;t remember anything that my si@@ x@@ th gra@@ de teach@@ er said all year , but I remember ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs ."
"And so I got interested in ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs , and you know , I stud@@ ied to get my ha@@ m li@@ cen@@ se . I was wi@@ ring up stuff ."
"H@@ ere I am at about 15 or something , doing that sort of stuff ."
O@@ kay ? That had a big effe@@ ct on me .
"So that &apos;s my point , that you can have a big effe@@ ct on these kids ."
"In fact , this re@@ min@@ ds me , I don &apos;t know , a couple years ago I gave a talk at a school in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to where there were about a do@@ z@@ en 1@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds that had come to this talk ."
I had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour .
"E@@ le@@ ven@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds , they &apos;re all sitting in a little se@@ mi@@ -@@ cir@@ cle looking up at me with big eyes , and I started , there was a white bo@@ ard behind me , and I started off by writing a one with 2@@ 2 zer@@ o@@ es after it , and I said , &quot; &quot; All right , now look , this is the number of star@@ s in the visi@@ ble universe , and this number is so big there &apos;s not even a name for it . &quot; &quot; And one of these kids sh@@ ot up his hand , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , actually there is a name for it ."
It &apos;s a se@@ x@@ tra@@ -@@ qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ -@@ h@@ ex@@ a@@ -@@ something or other . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?
"Now , that kid was wrong by four or@@ ders of mag@@ ni@@ tu@@ de , but there was no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t about it , these kids were s@@ mar@@ t ."
O@@ kay ? So I stop@@ ped gi@@ ving the le@@ cture .
All they wanted to do was ask questions .
"In fact , my last com@@ ments to these kids , at the end I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you kids are s@@ mar@@ ter than the people I work with . &quot; &quot; Now — ( Laughter ) They didn &apos;t even care about that ."
"What they wanted was my e@@ ma@@ il ad@@ dre@@ ss so they could ask me more questions . ( Laughter ) Let me just say , look , my job is a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge because we &apos;re in a spe@@ cial time ."
P@@ re@@ vi@@ ous gener@@ ations couldn &apos;t do this experim@@ ent at all .
"In another gener@@ ation down the line , I think we will have suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed ."
"So to me , it is a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge , and when I look in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , the fac@@ ts are that I really don &apos;t see myself ."
What I see is the gener@@ ation behind me .
"These are some kids from the H@@ u@@ ff S@@ cho@@ ol , f@@ our@@ th gra@@ ders ."
"I tal@@ ked there , what , two weeks ago , something like that ."
"I think that if you can in@@ still some inter@@ est in science and how it works , well , that &apos;s a pa@@ y@@ off be@@ y@@ ond e@@ asy meas@@ ure . Thank you very much ."
( Applause )
That &apos;s the question that changed my life fore@@ ver .
"I didn &apos;t know what to expe@@ ct , but I wasn &apos;t expe@@ cting that ."
"H@@ ow was I ever going to live the life full of ad@@ ven@@ ture and stories , as I always wanted ?"
I was absolu@@ tely physi@@ cally and emoti@@ on@@ ally bro@@ k@@ en .
And that is when it daw@@ ned on me that I didn &apos;t have to be fi@@ ve@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ -@@ five any@@ more .
I could be as t@@ all as I wanted !
So there were b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts here .
"And I didn &apos;t just see myself car@@ ving down a m@@ oun@@ tain of pow@@ der , I could actually feel it ."
"As you can see , ru@@ st@@ ed b@@ ol@@ ts , ru@@ b@@ ber , wood and ne@@ on p@@ in@@ k du@@ ct ta@@ pe ."
"I &apos;m here today to talk about social change , not a new ther@@ ap@@ y or a new inter@@ ven@@ tion or a new way of working with kids or something like that , but a new business model for social change , a new way of t@@ ac@@ k@@ ling the problem ."
"In Bri@@ tain , 6@@ 3 percent of all men who come out of shor@@ t s@@ ent@@ ences from pri@@ son re@@ -@@ of@@ f@@ end again within a year ."
Now how many pre@@ vi@@ ous of@@ f@@ en@@ ses do you think they have on a@@ ver@@ age man@@ aged to comm@@ it ?
F@@ or@@ ty@@ -@@ three .
And how many pre@@ vi@@ ous times do you think they &apos;ve been in pri@@ son ?
S@@ even .
"So we went to talk to the M@@ in@@ ist@@ ry of Ju@@ sti@@ ce , and we said to the M@@ in@@ ist@@ ry of Ju@@ sti@@ ce , what &apos;s it wor@@ th to you if fe@@ wer of these guys re@@ -@@ of@@ f@@ end ?"
"It &apos;s got to be wor@@ th something , right ?"
"I mean , there &apos;s pri@@ son co@@ sts , there &apos;s poli@@ ce co@@ sts , there &apos;s cour@@ t co@@ sts , all these things that you &apos;re sp@@ ending money on to deal with these guys . What &apos;s it wor@@ th ?"
"Now , of course , we care about the social val@@ ue ."
"S@@ o@@ cial F@@ in@@ ance , the organiz@@ ation I hel@@ ped set up , car@@ es about social stuff ."
"But we wanted to make the economic case , because if we could make the economic case , then the val@@ ue of doing this would be completely compe@@ l@@ ling ."
The idea is called the social impac@@ t b@@ ond .
"Now , the social impac@@ t b@@ ond is simply saying , if we can get the government to ag@@ ree , that we can create a con@@ trac@@ t where they only pay if it worked ."
So we have to ra@@ ise some money .
"S@@ o@@ cially moti@@ v@@ ated inv@@ est@@ ors : there &apos;s an interesting idea , right ?"
And here &apos;s the opportunity .
"And the inv@@ est@@ ors do not just get their money back , but they make a re@@ turn ."
"So in Mar@@ ch 20@@ 10 , we sig@@ ned the first social impac@@ t b@@ ond with the M@@ in@@ ist@@ ry of Ju@@ sti@@ ce around Pe@@ ter@@ bo@@ rou@@ gh P@@ ri@@ son ."
"It was to work with 3@@ ,000 of@@ f@@ en@@ ders sp@@ li@@ t into three co@@ hor@@ ts of 1@@ ,000 each ."
"They &apos;ve got to have a year to comm@@ it their cri@@ mes , six months to get through the cour@@ t system , and then they would be com@@ par@@ ed to a group taken from the poli@@ ce national computer , as si@@ mi@@ lar as possible , and we would get pa@@ id provi@@ ding we ach@@ ie@@ ved a h@@ ur@@ d@@ le r@@ ate of 1@@ 0-@@ percent redu@@ ction , for every con@@ vi@@ ction ev@@ ent that didn &apos;t happen ."
So we get pa@@ id for cri@@ mes sa@@ ved .
"Now if we ach@@ ie@@ ved that 1@@ 0-@@ percent redu@@ ction across all three co@@ hor@@ ts , then the inv@@ est@@ ors get a seven and a half percent an@@ nu@@ aliz@@ ed re@@ turn on their inv@@ est@@ ment , and if we do better than that , they can get up to 1@@ 3 percent an@@ nu@@ aliz@@ ed re@@ turn on their inv@@ est@@ ment , which is o@@ kay ."
"So everyone win@@ s here , right ?"
The M@@ in@@ ist@@ ry of Ju@@ sti@@ ce can try out a new program and they only pay if it works .
"In@@ v@@ est@@ ors get two opportuni@@ ties : for the first time , they can inv@@ est in social change ."
"A@@ l@@ so , they make a reas@@ on@@ able re@@ turn , and they also know that first inv@@ est@@ ors in these kinds of things , they &apos;re going to have to belie@@ ver@@ s ."
"S@@ o@@ cie@@ ty win@@ s : fe@@ wer cri@@ mes , fe@@ wer vi@@ cti@@ ms ."
"Now , the of@@ f@@ en@@ ders , they also b@@ en@@ ef@@ it ."
So let &apos;s think of another example : working with children in care .
So children in the state care ten@@ d to do very bad@@ ly .
"M@@ ore t@@ rou@@ b@@ lin@@ g@@ ly , 2@@ 7 percent of of@@ f@@ en@@ ders in pri@@ son have spent some time in care ."
The state is not a great par@@ ent .
So we set up a program with E@@ s@@ se@@ x C@@ oun@@ ty C@@ oun@@ ci@@ l to test out inten@@ sive family ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic sup@@ port for those fam@@ il@@ ies with ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ents on the ed@@ ge of the care system .
E@@ s@@ se@@ x only pa@@ ys in the ev@@ ent that it &apos;s sa@@ ving them care co@@ sts .
In@@ v@@ est@@ ors have put in 3@@ .@@ 1 million po@@ un@@ ds .
That program started last mon@@ th .
"O@@ thers , around hom@@ el@@ ess@@ ness in Lon@@ don , around y@@ outh and em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment and education el@@ se@@ where in the country ."
"There are now 1@@ 3 social impac@@ t b@@ on@@ ds in Bri@@ tain , and amazing le@@ v@@ els of inter@@ est in this idea all over the world ."
So Davi@@ d C@@ am@@ er@@ on &apos;s put 20 million po@@ un@@ ds into a social out@@ comes fu@@ nd to sup@@ port this idea .
So what &apos;s ca@@ used this exci@@ tem@@ ent ?
Why is this so different for people ?
"Well , the first piece , which we &apos;ve tal@@ ked about , is in@@ no@@ vation ."
It en@@ ab@@ les test@@ ing of new ideas in a way that &apos;s less difficult for everybody .
The second piece it br@@ ings is ri@@ g@@ or .
"B@@ y working to out@@ comes , people really have to test and bring data into the situ@@ ation that one &apos;s de@@ al@@ ing with ."
"And this le@@ ads to the third ele@@ ment , which is new , and that &apos;s f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility ."
"Because nor@@ mal con@@ trac@@ ting for things , when you &apos;re sp@@ ending government money , you &apos;re sp@@ ending our money , ta@@ x money , and the people who are in char@@ ge of that are very aw@@ are of it so the tem@@ p@@ tation is to control exactly how you spend it ."
"So when you &apos;re trying to do something like this , you need the f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility to ad@@ ap@@ t the program ."
The last ele@@ ment is part@@ ner@@ ship .
"There is , at the moment , a st@@ ale de@@ b@@ ate going on very often : state &apos;s better , public se@@ ctor &apos;s better , pri@@ v@@ ate se@@ ctor &apos;s better , social se@@ ctor &apos;s better , for a lot of these progra@@ ms ."
And this cre@@ ates a structure through which they can com@@ b@@ ine .
So where does this leave us ?
"We &apos;ve met thousands , possi@@ bly mi@@ llions of people , who want the opportunity to inv@@ est in social change ."
We &apos;ve met ch@@ am@@ pi@@ ons all over the public se@@ ctor ke@@ en to make these kinds of differ@@ ences .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;d like to talk today about how we can change our bra@@ ins and our society .
Me@@ et Jo@@ e .
Jo@@ e &apos;s 3@@ 2 years old and a mu@@ r@@ der@@ er .
I met Jo@@ e 1@@ 3 years ago on the li@@ f@@ er w@@ ing at Wor@@ m@@ wood S@@ c@@ ru@@ b@@ s high-@@ secu@@ ri@@ ty pri@@ son in Lon@@ don .
I &apos;d like you to imagine this place .
It looks and feel@@ s like it sounds : Wor@@ m@@ wood S@@ c@@ ru@@ b@@ s .
"@@ Bu@@ il@@ t at the end of the V@@ i@@ ct@@ ori@@ an E@@ ra by the in@@ mat@@ es themselves , it is where En@@ gl@@ and &apos;s most d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous pri@@ son@@ ers are ke@@ pt ."
These individu@@ als have com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted ac@@ ts of un@@ spe@@ ak@@ able evi@@ l .
And I was there to study their bra@@ ins .
"I was part of a team of resear@@ ch@@ ers from Uni@@ versity Col@@ le@@ ge Lon@@ don , on a gr@@ ant from the U.@@ K@@ . de@@ part@@ ment of health ."
My t@@ ask was to study a group of in@@ mat@@ es who had been c@@ lini@@ cally di@@ ag@@ no@@ sed as psy@@ ch@@ op@@ a@@ ths .
What l@@ ay at the ro@@ ot of their behavi@@ or ?
W@@ as there a neuro@@ logi@@ cal cause for their con@@ di@@ tion ?
"And if there was a neuro@@ logi@@ cal cause , could we find a cu@@ re ?"
"So I &apos;d like to speak about change , and es@@ pe@@ cially about emoti@@ onal change ."
"Wh@@ il@@ st the psy@@ ch@@ op@@ a@@ ths in our study were able to descri@@ be the pi@@ ctures ac@@ cur@@ ately , they fai@@ led to show the emoti@@ ons requi@@ red ."
They fai@@ led to show a physi@@ cal respon@@ se .
It was as though they knew the words but not the music of em@@ pa@@ th@@ y .
That turned out to be not such an e@@ asy t@@ ask .
It is thought to be key to the experience of em@@ pa@@ th@@ y .
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , the more em@@ pa@@ th@@ ic a person is , the lar@@ ger and more ac@@ tive their am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a is ."
So let &apos;s take a ste@@ p back .
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing mor@@ al behavi@@ or is simply part of grow@@ ing up , like lear@@ ning to speak ."
"A@@ t first , this isn &apos;t perfe@@ ct ."
"If you d@@ ou@@ b@@ t this , try , as I &apos;ve done , to r@@ ene@@ ge on a pro@@ mi@@ se you &apos;ve made to a f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old ."
You will find that the mind of a f@@ our@@ -@@ year old is not na@@ ï@@ ve in the sli@@ gh@@ test .
The early years are c@@ ru@@ cial .
"There seem@@ s to be a win@@ do@@ w of opportunity , after which ma@@ ster@@ ing mor@@ al questions be@@ comes more difficult , like ad@@ ul@@ ts lear@@ ning a fore@@ ig@@ n language ."
That &apos;s not to say it &apos;s im@@ possible .
So can bra@@ ins change ?
"But then , in the 199@@ 0s , stud@@ ies star@@ ting show@@ ing , fol@@ low@@ ing the le@@ ad of E@@ li@@ za@@ be@@ th G@@ ould at P@@ r@@ in@@ ce@@ ton and others , stud@@ ies started show@@ ing the evi@@ dence of neuro@@ gen@@ e@@ sis , the bir@@ th of new brain cells in the ad@@ ul@@ t m@@ am@@ m@@ ali@@ an brain , first in the ol@@ fac@@ t@@ ory bu@@ l@@ b , which is respon@@ si@@ ble for our sense of s@@ me@@ ll , then in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ pu@@ s inv@@ ol@@ ving shor@@ t-@@ ter@@ m memor@@ y , and finally in the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a itself ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad of psy@@ ch@@ op@@ a@@ ths , I stud@@ ied mi@@ ce , because the same pat@@ ter@@ n of brain respon@@ ses ap@@ pe@@ ars across many different species of social animals ."
One way such re@@ ha@@ bi@@ lit@@ ation might work is through re@@ stor@@ ative ju@@ sti@@ ce progra@@ ms .
This sti@@ mu@@ lat@@ es the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a and may be a more effe@@ ctive re@@ ha@@ bi@@ lit@@ ative prac@@ ti@@ ce than simple in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation .
"S@@ u@@ ch progra@@ ms won &apos;t work for everyone , but for many , it could be a way to bre@@ ak the f@@ roz@@ en se@@ a within ."
So what can we do now ?
How can we app@@ ly this know@@ le@@ dge ?
The first thing that I learned was that we need to change our min@@ d@@ set .
"@@ Y@@ et the moment we speak about pri@@ s@@ ons , it &apos;s as though we &apos;re back in D@@ i@@ ck@@ en@@ si@@ an times , if not me@@ d@@ ie@@ v@@ al times ."
It &apos;s e@@ asy enough for a neuro@@ scienti@@ st to place a high-@@ secu@@ ri@@ ty in@@ m@@ ate in an M@@ R@@ I sc@@ an@@ ner .
"Well actually , that turns out not to be so e@@ asy , but ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely what we want to show is whether we &apos;re able to redu@@ ce the re@@ of@@ f@@ ending r@@ ates ."
"In order to answer comple@@ x questions like that , we need people of different back@@ gro@@ un@@ ds — lab@@ -@@ based scienti@@ sts and c@@ lini@@ ci@@ ans , social wor@@ k@@ ers and poli@@ cy mak@@ ers , ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pi@@ sts and human ri@@ ghts acti@@ vi@@ sts — to work together ."
Wi@@ ll he be am@@ ong the 70 percent of in@@ mat@@ es who end up re@@ of@@ f@@ ending and re@@ tur@@ ning to the pri@@ son system ?
"S@@ u@@ re@@ ly , that would be in the inter@@ est of all of us ."
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"I gre@@ w up in Europ@@ e , and World W@@ ar I@@ I ca@@ u@@ ght me when I was between seven and 10 years old ."
"And I realized how few of the grow@@ n@@ -@@ u@@ ps that I knew were able to with@@ stand the tra@@ ge@@ d@@ ies that the war visi@@ ted on them — how few of them could even re@@ se@@ m@@ ble a nor@@ mal , con@@ ten@@ ted , s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied , happy life once their job , their home , their secu@@ ri@@ ty was de@@ stro@@ yed by the war ."
So I became interested in under@@ standing what con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted to a life that was wor@@ th living .
"And I tr@@ ied , as a child , as a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er , to read phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y and to get inv@@ olved in art and religi@@ on and many other ways that I could see as a possible answer to that question ."
And finally I en@@ ded up en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing psycho@@ logy by ch@@ ance .
"I was at a ski re@@ sort in S@@ wit@@ zer@@ land without any money to actually en@@ jo@@ y myself , because the s@@ now had me@@ l@@ ted and I didn &apos;t have money to go to a movie . But I found that on the — I read in the ne@@ wsp@@ a@@ per@@ s that there was to be a pres@@ ent@@ ation by someone in a place that I &apos;d seen in the cen@@ ter of Z@@ u@@ ri@@ ch , and it was about fl@@ ying sa@@ u@@ c@@ ers &#91; that &#93; he was going to talk ."
"And I thought , well , since I can &apos;t go to the mov@@ ies , at least I will go for f@@ ree to list@@ en to fl@@ ying sa@@ u@@ c@@ ers ."
And the man who tal@@ ked at that ev@@ ening le@@ cture was very interesting .
"In@@ ste@@ ad of talking about little green men , he tal@@ ked about how the psy@@ ch@@ e of the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans had been tra@@ um@@ ati@@ zed by the war , and now they &apos;re proje@@ cting fl@@ ying sa@@ u@@ c@@ ers into the sk@@ y ."
He tal@@ ked about how the m@@ and@@ al@@ as of an@@ cient H@@ in@@ d@@ u religi@@ on were kind of proje@@ cted into the sk@@ y as an at@@ tem@@ pt to re@@ ga@@ in some sense of order after the cha@@ os of war .
And this seem@@ ed very interesting to me .
And I started re@@ ading his boo@@ ks after that le@@ cture .
"And that was C@@ ar@@ l J@@ ung , wh@@ ose name or work I had no idea about ."
Th@@ en I came to this country to study psycho@@ logy and I started trying to understand the ro@@ ots of happ@@ iness .
"This is a ty@@ pi@@ cal resul@@ t that many people have pre@@ sen@@ ted , and there are many v@@ ari@@ ations on it ."
"But this , for in@@ stance , shows that about 30 percent of the people sur@@ ve@@ yed in the United States since 19@@ 5@@ 6 say that their life is very happy ."
And that ha@@ sn &apos;t changed at all .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the per@@ s@@ onal in@@ come , on a scale that has been he@@ ld con@@ st@@ ant to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ate for in@@ fl@@ ation , has more than d@@ ou@@ b@@ led , almost tri@@ p@@ led , in that per@@ i@@ od ."
"But you find essen@@ ti@@ ally the same resul@@ ts , na@@ me@@ ly , that after a certain basi@@ c point — which cor@@ respon@@ ds more or less to just a few 1@@ ,000 dollars ab@@ o@@ ve the min@@ i@@ mu@@ m po@@ ver@@ ty level — incre@@ ases in materi@@ al wel@@ l-@@ being don &apos;t se@@ em to af@@ fe@@ ct how happy people are ."
"In fact , you can find that the l@@ ack of basi@@ c re@@ sources , materi@@ al re@@ sources , con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes to un@@ happ@@ iness , but the incre@@ ase in materi@@ al re@@ sources does not incre@@ ase happ@@ iness ."
"So my research has been fo@@ c@@ used more on — after fin@@ ding out these things that actually cor@@ respon@@ ded to my own experience , I tr@@ ied to understand : where — in every@@ day life , in our nor@@ mal experience — do we feel really happy ?"
"And to start those stud@@ ies about 40 years ago , I began to look at cre@@ ative people — first arti@@ sts and scienti@@ sts , and so for@@ th — trying to understand what made them feel that it was wor@@ th essen@@ ti@@ ally sp@@ ending their life doing things for which many of them didn &apos;t expe@@ ct either fam@@ e or for@@ tu@@ ne , but which made their life me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful and wor@@ th doing ."
This was one of the le@@ ading com@@ pos@@ ers of American music back in the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
And the inter@@ view was 40 p@@ ages long .
But this little ex@@ cer@@ pt is a very good sum@@ mar@@ y of what he was saying during the inter@@ view .
And it descri@@ be@@ s how he feel@@ s when com@@ pos@@ ing is going well .
And he says by descri@@ b@@ ing it as an e@@ c@@ st@@ atic state .
"Now , &quot; &quot; e@@ c@@ st@@ asy &quot; &quot; in Gre@@ ek me@@ ant simply to stand to the side of something ."
And then it became essen@@ ti@@ ally an an@@ al@@ og@@ y for a ment@@ al state where you feel that you are not doing your ordin@@ ary every@@ day rou@@ t@@ ines .
So e@@ c@@ st@@ asy is essen@@ ti@@ ally a ste@@ pping into an alter@@ n@@ ative re@@ ality .
"And it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations that we look up to as having been p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ les of human ach@@ ie@@ v@@ ement — whether it &apos;s China , Gre@@ e@@ ce , the H@@ in@@ d@@ u ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , or the Ma@@ y@@ as , or E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ ans — what we know about them is really about their e@@ c@@ st@@ as@@ ies , not about their every@@ day life ."
"We know the tem@@ ples they built , where people could come to experience a different re@@ ality ."
"We know about the cir@@ c@@ uses , the ar@@ en@@ as , the the@@ at@@ ers ."
"These are the re@@ ma@@ ins of ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated , more or@@ der@@ ed form ."
"Now , this man doesn &apos;t need to go to a place like this , which is also — this place , this ar@@ en@@ a , which is built like a Gre@@ ek am@@ phi@@ the@@ at@@ re , is a place for e@@ c@@ st@@ asy also ."
We are parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ing in a re@@ ality that is different from that of the every@@ day life that we &apos;re used to .
But this man doesn &apos;t need to go there .
"He needs just a piece of pa@@ per where he can put down little mar@@ ks , and as he does that , he can imagine sounds that had not ex@@ ist@@ ed before in that particular com@@ bin@@ ation ."
"So once he gets to that point of beginning to create , like J@@ en@@ ni@@ f@@ er did in her impro@@ vi@@ s@@ ation , a new re@@ ality — that is , a moment of e@@ c@@ st@@ asy — he en@@ ters that different re@@ ality ."
Now he says also that this is so inten@@ se an experience that it feel@@ s almost as if he didn &apos;t exi@@ st .
And that sounds like a kind of a ro@@ man@@ tic ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation .
"But actually , our ner@@ v@@ ous system is in@@ cap@@ able of pro@@ cess@@ ing more than about 1@@ 10 bi@@ ts of information per second ."
"And in order to hear me and understand what I &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 bi@@ ts per second ."
That &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear more than two people .
You can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
"Well , when you are really inv@@ olved in this completely eng@@ ag@@ ing process of cre@@ ating something new , as this man is , he doesn &apos;t have enough at@@ ten@@ tion left over to mon@@ it@@ or how his body feel@@ s , or his problems at home ."
He can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s hun@@ g@@ ry or ti@@ red .
"H@@ is body disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars , his iden@@ ti@@ ty disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars from his con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness , because he doesn &apos;t have enough at@@ ten@@ tion , like n@@ one of us do , to really do well something that requi@@ res a lot of con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation , and at the same time to feel that he ex@@ ist@@ s ."
So ex@@ ist@@ ence is tem@@ por@@ ari@@ ly s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded .
And he says that his hand seem@@ s to be moving by itself .
"Now , I could look at my hand for two weeks , and I wouldn &apos;t feel any a@@ we or won@@ der , because I can &apos;t com@@ pos@@ e . ( Laughter ) So what it &apos;s tel@@ ling you here is that obvi@@ ously this au@@ tom@@ atic , spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous process that he &apos;s descri@@ b@@ ing can only happen to someone who is very well tra@@ ined and who has develo@@ ped techni@@ qu@@ e ."
And it has become a kind of a tru@@ is@@ m in the study of cre@@ ati@@ vity that you can &apos;t be cre@@ ating anything with less than 10 years of techni@@ cal@@ -@@ know@@ le@@ dge im@@ mer@@ sion in a particular fie@@ ld .
"W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs or music , it takes that long to be able to beg@@ in to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before ."
"Now , when that happens , he says the music just f@@ low@@ s out ."
And because all of these people I started inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ing — this was an inter@@ view which is over 30 years old — so many of the people descri@@ bed this as a spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous f@@ low that I called this ty@@ pe of experience the &quot; &quot; f@@ low experience . &quot; &quot; And it happens in different re@@ al@@ ms .
"For in@@ stance , a po@@ et descri@@ be@@ s it in this form ."
This is by a stud@@ ent of m@@ ine who inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ed some of the le@@ ading wri@@ ters and po@@ ets in the United States .
"And it descri@@ be@@ s the same ef@@ for@@ t@@ less , spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous feeling that you get when you enter into this e@@ c@@ st@@ atic state ."
"This po@@ et descri@@ be@@ s it as open@@ ing a door that flo@@ ats in the sk@@ y — a very si@@ mi@@ lar descri@@ ption to what Al@@ ber@@ t E@@ inste@@ in gave as to how he imag@@ ined the for@@ ces of relati@@ vity , when he was stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with trying to understand how it worked ."
But it happens in other acti@@ vi@@ ties .
"For in@@ stance , this is another stud@@ ent of m@@ ine , S@@ us@@ an J@@ ac@@ k@@ son from Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , who did work with some of the le@@ ading a@@ th@@ le@@ tes in the world ."
"And you see here in this descri@@ ption of an O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c sk@@ ater , the same essen@@ tial descri@@ ption of the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ o@@ logy of the in@@ ner state of the person ."
"You don &apos;t think ; it goes au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally , if you mer@@ ge yourself with the music , and so for@@ th ."
"It happens also , actually , in the most re@@ cent book I wro@@ te , called &quot; &quot; Go@@ od B@@ us@@ iness , &quot; &quot; where I inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ed some of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had been n@@ om@@ in@@ ated by their pe@@ ers as being both very suc@@ cess@@ ful and very e@@ thi@@ cal , very so@@ cially respon@@ si@@ ble ."
You see that these people def@@ ine suc@@ cess as something that hel@@ ps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .
"And like all of these suc@@ cess@@ ful and respon@@ si@@ ble C@@ E@@ O@@ s say , you can &apos;t have just one of these things be suc@@ cess@@ ful if you want a me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful and suc@@ cess@@ ful job ."
A@@ ni@@ ta R@@ od@@ di@@ ck is another one of these C@@ E@@ O@@ s we inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ed .
"S@@ he is the f@@ oun@@ der of B@@ ody S@@ ho@@ p , the natural co@@ s@@ me@@ ti@@ cs king ."
It &apos;s kind of a pas@@ sion that comes from doing the best and having f@@ low while you &apos;re working .
"This is an interesting little quot@@ e from M@@ as@@ ar@@ u I@@ bu@@ ka , who was at that time star@@ ting out S@@ ony without any money , without a produ@@ ct — they didn &apos;t have a produ@@ ct , they didn &apos;t have anything , but they had an idea ."
"And the idea he had was to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh a place of work where engine@@ ers can feel the jo@@ y of technologi@@ cal in@@ no@@ vation , be aw@@ are of their mis@@ sion to society and work to their heart &apos;s cont@@ ent ."
I couldn &apos;t impro@@ ve on this as a good example of how f@@ low en@@ ters the wor@@ k@@ place .
"Now , when we do stud@@ ies — we have , with other colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es around the world , done over 8@@ ,000 inter@@ vie@@ ws of people — from D@@ om@@ ini@@ can mon@@ ks , to bl@@ ind n@@ un@@ s , to H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ an clim@@ bers , to Na@@ v@@ aj@@ o sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ ds — who en@@ jo@@ y their work ."
"And re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the culture , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of education or whatever , there are these seven con@@ di@@ tions that se@@ em to be there when a person is in f@@ low ."
"There &apos;s this fo@@ cus that , once it be@@ comes inten@@ se , le@@ ads to a sense of e@@ c@@ st@@ asy , a sense of c@@ lar@@ ity : you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other ; you get im@@ medi@@ ate fe@@ ed@@ back ."
"You know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars , you for@@ get yourself , you feel part of something lar@@ ger ."
"And once the con@@ di@@ tions are present , what you are doing be@@ comes wor@@ th doing for its own s@@ ake ."
"In our stud@@ ies , we re@@ present the every@@ day life of people in this simple s@@ che@@ me ."
"And we can meas@@ ure this very pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly , actually , because we give people ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic p@@ ag@@ ers that go off 10 times a day , and wh@@ en@@ ever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about ."
And two things that we meas@@ ure is the amount of challen@@ ge people experience at that moment and the amount of sk@@ i@@ ll that they feel they have at that moment .
"So for each person we can est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh an a@@ ver@@ age , which is the cen@@ ter of the di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m ."
"That would be your mean level of challen@@ ge and sk@@ i@@ ll , which will be different from that of any@@ body else ."
"But you have a kind of a set point there , which would be in the mi@@ ddle ."
"If we know what that set point is , we can pre@@ di@@ ct fa@@ ir@@ ly ac@@ cur@@ ately when you will be in f@@ low , and it will be when your challen@@ ges are high@@ er than a@@ ver@@ age and sk@@ il@@ ls are high@@ er than a@@ ver@@ age ."
"And you may be doing things very differ@@ ently from other people , but for everyone that f@@ low ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l , that area there , will be when you are doing what you really like to do — play the pi@@ ano , be with your best friend , per@@ haps work , if work is what provi@@ des f@@ low for you ."
And then the other are@@ as become less and less posi@@ tive .
A@@ ro@@ us@@ al is still good because you are over@@ -@@ challen@@ g@@ ed there .
"@@ Y@@ our sk@@ il@@ ls are not quite as high as they should be , but you can move into f@@ low fa@@ ir@@ ly e@@ a@@ si@@ ly by just develo@@ ping a little more sk@@ i@@ ll ."
"So , aro@@ us@@ al is the area where most people learn from , because that &apos;s where they &apos;re p@@ us@@ h@@ ed be@@ y@@ ond their comfor@@ t z@@ one and to enter that — going back to f@@ low — then they develo@@ p high@@ er sk@@ il@@ ls ."
"C@@ on@@ tro@@ l is also a good place to be , because there you feel comfor@@ table , but not very exci@@ ted ."
It &apos;s not very challen@@ g@@ ing any more .
"And if you want to enter f@@ low from control , you have to incre@@ ase the challen@@ ges ."
So those two are ide@@ al and comple@@ ment@@ ary are@@ as from which f@@ low is e@@ asy to go into .
The other com@@ bin@@ ations of challen@@ ge and sk@@ i@@ ll become pro@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vely less op@@ ti@@ mal .
R@@ el@@ ax@@ ation is f@@ ine — you still feel OK .
"B@@ ore@@ dom begin@@ s to be very a@@ ver@@ sive and a@@ pa@@ th@@ y be@@ comes very neg@@ ative : you don &apos;t feel that you &apos;re doing anything , you don &apos;t use your sk@@ il@@ ls , there &apos;s no challen@@ ge ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , a lot of people &apos;s experience is in a@@ pa@@ th@@ y ."
"The largest single con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tor to that experience is wat@@ ching tele@@ vision ; the next one is being in the ba@@ th@@ room , sitting ."
"E@@ ven though sometimes wat@@ ching tele@@ vision about seven to eight percent of the time is in f@@ low , but that &apos;s when you cho@@ ose a program you really want to wat@@ ch and you get fe@@ ed@@ back from it ."
So the question we are trying to ad@@ dre@@ ss — and I &apos;m way over time — is how to put more and more of every@@ day life in that f@@ low ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l .
And that is the kind of challen@@ ge that we &apos;re trying to understand .
"And some of you obvi@@ ously know how to do that spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously without any ad@@ vice , but un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely a lot of people don &apos;t ."
"And that &apos;s what our m@@ and@@ ate is , in a way , to do ."

"Well when I was asked to do this TE@@ D@@ T@@ al@@ k , I was really ch@@ u@@ ck@@ led , because , you see , my father &apos;s name was T@@ ed , and much of my life , es@@ pe@@ cially my musi@@ cal life , is really a talk that I &apos;m still having with him , or the part of me that he contin@@ u@@ es to be ."
"Now T@@ ed was a New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er , an al@@ l-@@ around the@@ ater guy , and he was a self-@@ t@@ au@@ ght il@@ lu@@ str@@ ator and musi@@ ci@@ an ."
"He didn &apos;t read a not@@ e , and he was prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly hear@@ ing im@@ pa@@ i@@ red ."
"@@ Y@@ et , he was my gre@@ at@@ est teach@@ er ."
"Because even through the squ@@ e@@ ak@@ s of his hear@@ ing a@@ i@@ ds , his under@@ standing of music was pro@@ found ."
"And for him , it wasn &apos;t so much the way the music goes as about what it wit@@ n@@ ess@@ es and where it can take you ."
"And he did a pain@@ ting of this experience , which he called &quot; &quot; In the Re@@ al@@ m of Music . &quot; &quot; Now T@@ ed en@@ ter@@ ed this re@@ al@@ m every day by impro@@ vi@@ sing in a sort of T@@ in P@@ an Al@@ ley sty@@ le like this ."
( Music ) But he was t@@ ough when it came to music .
"He said , &quot; &quot; There are only two things that matter in music : what and how ."
"And the thing about clas@@ si@@ cal music , that what and how , it &apos;s in@@ ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sti@@ ble . &quot; &quot; That was his pas@@ sion for the music ."
B@@ ot@@ h my parents really lo@@ ved it .
"They didn &apos;t know all that much about it , but they gave me the opportunity to disco@@ ver it together with them ."
"And I think inspi@@ red by that memor@@ y , it &apos;s been my de@@ si@@ re to try and bring it to as many other people as I can , sort of pas@@ s it on through whatever means ."
"And how people get this music , how it comes into their lives , really fas@@ cin@@ ates me ."
"One day in New York , I was on the stre@@ et and I saw some kids playing bas@@ e@@ ball between sto@@ op@@ s and cars and fi@@ re hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts ."
"And a t@@ ough , sl@@ ou@@ chy kid got up to b@@ at , and he took a s@@ w@@ ing and really conne@@ cted ."
"And he wat@@ ched the ball f@@ ly for a second , and then he went , &quot; &quot; D@@ ah d@@ ad@@ ar@@ at@@ at@@ at@@ ah ."
Bra@@ h d@@ ada d@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ah . &quot; &quot; And he ran around the bas@@ es .
"And I thought , go figure ."
How did this piece of 1@@ 8@@ th century Au@@ stri@@ an ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ r@@ atic en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment turn into the vi@@ ct@@ ory cro@@ w of this New York kid ?
How was that pas@@ sed on ? How did he get to hear Mo@@ zar@@ t ?
"Well when it comes to clas@@ si@@ cal music , there &apos;s an aw@@ ful lot to pas@@ s on , much more than Mo@@ zar@@ t , Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven or T@@ chi@@ ak@@ o@@ v@@ sk@@ y ."
"Because clas@@ si@@ cal music is an un@@ bro@@ k@@ en living tra@@ di@@ tion that goes back over 1@@ ,000 years ."
And every one of those years has had something uni@@ qu@@ e and powerful to say to us about what it &apos;s like to be ali@@ ve .
"Now the ra@@ w materi@@ al of it , of course , is just the music of every@@ day life ."
It &apos;s all the an@@ the@@ ms and dance c@@ raz@@ es and bal@@ l@@ ads and mar@@ ch@@ es .
"But what clas@@ si@@ cal music does is to di@@ still all of these musi@@ cs down , to con@@ den@@ se them to their absolu@@ te essen@@ ce , and from that essen@@ ce create a new language , a language that spe@@ ak@@ s very lo@@ v@@ ing@@ ly and un@@ f@@ lin@@ ch@@ ing@@ ly about who we really are ."
It &apos;s a language that &apos;s still ev@@ ol@@ ving .
"Now over the cen@@ tur@@ ies it gre@@ w into the big pie@@ ces we always think of , like con@@ cer@@ to@@ s and sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , but even the most am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous ma@@ ster@@ piece can have as its cent@@ ral mis@@ sion to bring you back to a fra@@ gi@@ le and per@@ s@@ onal moment — like this one from the Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven V@@ i@@ o@@ li@@ n Con@@ cer@@ to ."
"( Music ) It &apos;s so simple , so ev@@ oc@@ ative ."
So many emoti@@ ons se@@ em to be inside of it .
"@@ Y@@ et , of course , like all music , it &apos;s essen@@ ti@@ ally not about anything ."
It &apos;s just a design of pit@@ ch@@ es and sil@@ ence and time .
"And the pit@@ ch@@ es , the not@@ es , as you know , are just vi@@ br@@ ations ."
They &apos;re lo@@ c@@ ations in the spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of sound .
"And whether we call them 4@@ 40 per second , A , or 3@@ ,@@ 7@@ 2@@ 9 , B f@@ lat — tr@@ ust me , that &apos;s right — they &apos;re just ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a ."
But the way we re@@ act to different com@@ bin@@ ations of these ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a is comple@@ x and emoti@@ onal and not tot@@ ally under@@ sto@@ od .
"And the way we re@@ act to them has changed radi@@ cally over the cen@@ tur@@ ies , as have our pre@@ fer@@ ences for them ."
"So for example , in the 1@@ 1@@ th century , people li@@ ked pie@@ ces that en@@ ded like this ."
"( Music ) And in the 1@@ 7@@ th century , it was more like this . ( Music )"
And in the 2@@ 1@@ st century ... ( Music )
"Now your 2@@ 1@@ st century ear@@ s are quite happy with this last ch@@ or@@ d , even though a while back it would have pu@@ z@@ z@@ led or an@@ no@@ yed you or s@@ ent some of you ru@@ n@@ ning from the room ."
"And the reason you like it is because you &apos;ve in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted , whether you knew it or not , cen@@ tur@@ ie@@ s@@ -@@ wor@@ th of chang@@ es in musi@@ cal the@@ ory , prac@@ ti@@ ce and fas@@ hi@@ on ."
"And in clas@@ si@@ cal music we can fol@@ low these chang@@ es very , very ac@@ cur@@ ately because of the music &apos;s powerful sil@@ ent part@@ ner , the way it &apos;s been pas@@ sed on : not@@ ation ."
"Now the im@@ pul@@ se to not@@ ate , or , more exactly I should say , en@@ c@@ od@@ e music has been with us for a very long time ."
"In 2@@ 00 B@@ .@@ C@@ . , a man na@@ med Se@@ ku@@ lo@@ s wro@@ te this s@@ ong for his de@@ par@@ ted wi@@ fe and in@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed it on her gra@@ v@@ est@@ one in the not@@ ational system of the Gre@@ e@@ ks ."
"( Music ) And a thous@@ and years later , this im@@ pul@@ se to not@@ ate took an enti@@ re@@ ly different form ."
"And you can see how this happened in these ex@@ cer@@ p@@ ts from the Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as mas@@ s &quot; &quot; P@@ u@@ er N@@ at@@ us est no@@ b@@ is , &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ or U@@ s is B@@ or@@ n . &quot;"
"( Music ) In the 10@@ th century , little s@@ qui@@ gg@@ les were used just to indi@@ cate the gener@@ al sha@@ pe of the tu@@ ne ."
"And in the 1@@ 2@@ th century , a line was d@@ raw@@ n , like a musi@@ cal h@@ ori@@ z@@ on line , to better p@@ in@@ point the pit@@ ch &apos;s lo@@ cation ."
"And then in the 1@@ 3@@ th century , more lin@@ es and new sha@@ p@@ es of not@@ es lo@@ cked in the con@@ cept of the tu@@ ne exactly , and that led to the kind of not@@ ation we have today ."
"Well not@@ ation not only pas@@ sed the music on , not@@ ating and en@@ c@@ od@@ ing the music changed its pri@@ or@@ it@@ ies enti@@ re@@ ly , because it en@@ ab@@ led the musi@@ ci@@ ans to imagine music on a much v@@ ast@@ er scale ."
"Now inspi@@ red mo@@ ves of impro@@ vi@@ s@@ ation could be recor@@ ded , sa@@ ved , consi@@ der@@ ed , pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed , made into in@@ tri@@ cate desig@@ ns ."
"And from this moment , clas@@ si@@ cal music became what it most essen@@ ti@@ ally is , a di@@ al@@ og@@ ue between the two powerful si@@ des of our nature : in@@ st@@ in@@ ct and inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence ."
And there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of impro@@ vi@@ s@@ ation and the art of com@@ posi@@ tion .
"Now an impro@@ vi@@ s@@ er sen@@ ses and pla@@ ys the next cool move , but a com@@ pos@@ er is consi@@ der@@ ing all possible mo@@ ves , test@@ ing them out , pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ing them out , until he se@@ es how they can form a powerful and co@@ her@@ ent design of ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate and en@@ during co@@ ol@@ ness ."
"Now some of the gre@@ at@@ est com@@ pos@@ ers , like B@@ ach , were com@@ bin@@ ations of these two things ."
B@@ ach was like a great impro@@ vi@@ s@@ er with a mind of a ch@@ ess ma@@ ster .
Mo@@ zar@@ t was the same way .
"But every musi@@ ci@@ an stri@@ k@@ es a different bal@@ ance between fai@@ th and reason , in@@ st@@ in@@ ct and inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence ."
"And every musi@@ cal era had different pri@@ or@@ it@@ ies of these things , different things to pas@@ s on , different &apos; wh@@ ats &apos; and &apos; h@@ ow@@ s &apos; ."
So in the first eight cen@@ tur@@ ies or so of this tra@@ di@@ tion the big &apos; what &apos; was to pra@@ ise God .
"And by the 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 0s , music was being wri@@ t@@ ten that tr@@ ied to mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r God &apos;s mind as could be seen in the design of the night sk@@ y ."
"The &apos; how &apos; was a sty@@ le called po@@ ly@@ ph@@ ony , music of many in@@ depen@@ d@@ ently moving vo@@ i@@ ces that su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed the way the plane@@ ts seem@@ ed to move in P@@ to@@ le@@ my &apos;s ge@@ o@@ cent@@ ri@@ c universe ."
This was tru@@ ly the music of the sp@@ her@@ es .
( Music ) This is the kind of music that Le@@ on@@ ar@@ do D@@ a@@ V@@ in@@ ci would have known .
"And per@@ haps its tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al perfe@@ ction and ser@@ eni@@ ty me@@ ant that something new had to happen — a radi@@ cal new move , which in 1@@ 6@@ 00 is what did happen ."
"( Music ) S@@ ing@@ er : A@@ h , bi@@ t@@ ter b@@ low !"
"A@@ h , wi@@ cked , c@@ ru@@ el f@@ ate !"
"A@@ h , b@@ ale@@ ful star@@ s !"
"A@@ h , av@@ ari@@ ci@@ ous he@@ a@@ ven !"
"M@@ T@@ T : This , of course , was the bir@@ th of op@@ era , and its develo@@ pment put music on a radi@@ cal new course ."
"The what now was not to mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r the mind of God , but to fol@@ low the emoti@@ on tur@@ bu@@ l@@ ence of man ."
"And the how was har@@ mon@@ y , st@@ ac@@ king up the pit@@ ch@@ es to form ch@@ or@@ ds ."
"And the ch@@ or@@ ds , it turned out , were cap@@ able of re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing incredible v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties of emoti@@ ons ."
"And the basi@@ c ch@@ or@@ ds were the ones we still have with us , the tri@@ ads , either the major one , which we think is happy , or the min@@ or one , which we per@@ cei@@ ve as sa@@ d ."
But what &apos;s the ac@@ tu@@ al difference between these two ch@@ or@@ ds ?
It &apos;s just these two not@@ es in the mi@@ ddle .
"It &apos;s either E natural , and 6@@ 5@@ 9 vi@@ br@@ ations per second , or E f@@ lat , at 6@@ 2@@ 2 ."
So the big difference between human happ@@ iness and s@@ ad@@ ness ?
3@@ 7 fre@@ ak@@ in &apos; vi@@ br@@ ations .
So you can see in a system like this there was en@@ or@@ m@@ ous sub@@ tle poten@@ tial of re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing human emoti@@ ons .
"And in fact , as man began to understand more his comple@@ x and am@@ bi@@ val@@ ent nature , har@@ mon@@ y gre@@ w more comple@@ x to ref@@ le@@ ct it ."
T@@ ur@@ ns out it was cap@@ able of ex@@ pres@@ sing emoti@@ ons be@@ y@@ ond the ability of words .
"Now with all this possi@@ bility , clas@@ si@@ cal music really took off ."
It &apos;s the time in which the big form@@ s began to ari@@ se .
"And the effe@@ cts of technology began to be felt also , because prin@@ ting put music , the s@@ co@@ res , the co@@ de@@ boo@@ ks of music , into the h@@ ands of perform@@ ers every@@ where ."
And new and impro@@ ved instru@@ ments made the age of the vi@@ r@@ tu@@ o@@ so possible .
"This is when those big form@@ s aro@@ se — the sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , the son@@ at@@ as , the con@@ cer@@ to@@ s ."
"And in these big archite@@ ctures of time , com@@ pos@@ ers like Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven could share the in@@ si@@ ghts of a li@@ fe@@ time ."
"A piece like Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven &apos;s F@@ i@@ f@@ th basically wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing how it was possible for him to go from sor@@ row and ang@@ er , over the course of a half an hour , ste@@ p by ex@@ ac@@ ting ste@@ p of his rou@@ te , to the moment when he could make it across to jo@@ y ."
"( Music ) And it turned out the sym@@ ph@@ ony could be used for more comple@@ x issu@@ es , like g@@ ri@@ pping ones of culture , such as n@@ ati@@ on@@ ali@@ sm or qu@@ est for fre@@ e@@ dom or the fron@@ t@@ ier@@ s of sen@@ su@@ ality ."
"But whatever dire@@ ction the music took , one thing until re@@ cent@@ ly was always the same , and that was when the musi@@ ci@@ ans stop@@ ped playing , the music stop@@ ped ."
Now this moment so fas@@ cin@@ ates me .
I find it such a pro@@ found one .
What happens when the music stop@@ s ?
W@@ here does it go ? What &apos;s left ?
What sti@@ cks with people in the audience at the end of a perform@@ ance ?
Is it a me@@ lo@@ dy or a r@@ hy@@ th@@ m or a mo@@ od or an at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de ?
And how might that change their lives ?
"To me this is the in@@ ti@@ m@@ ate , per@@ s@@ onal side of music ."
It &apos;s the pas@@ sing on part . It &apos;s the &apos; why &apos; part of it .
And to me that &apos;s the most essen@@ tial of all .
"M@@ ost@@ ly it &apos;s been a per@@ son@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ person thing , a teach@@ er@@ -@@ stud@@ ent , perform@@ er@@ -@@ audience thing , and then around 1@@ 8@@ 80 came this new technology that first mechani@@ cally then through an@@ al@@ o@@ gs then di@@ gi@@ t@@ ally created a new and mi@@ rac@@ ul@@ ous way of pas@@ sing things on , al@@ be@@ it an im@@ per@@ s@@ onal one ."
"P@@ e@@ ople could now hear music all the time , even though it wasn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ary for them to play an instru@@ ment , read music or even go to con@@ cer@@ ts ."
And technology de@@ moc@@ r@@ ati@@ zed music by making everything available .
It spe@@ ar@@ he@@ ad@@ ed a cul@@ tu@@ ral re@@ v@@ olution in which arti@@ sts like C@@ ar@@ us@@ o and B@@ ess@@ ie S@@ mi@@ th were on the same fo@@ ot@@ ing .
"And technology p@@ us@@ h@@ ed com@@ pos@@ ers to tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous extre@@ mes , using compu@@ ters and syn@@ the@@ si@@ z@@ ers to create works of in@@ tel@@ le@@ c@@ tually im@@ pen@@ e@@ tra@@ ble comple@@ x@@ ity be@@ y@@ ond the means of perform@@ ers and aud@@ ien@@ ces ."
"A@@ t the same time technology , by taking over the ro@@ le that not@@ ation had always pla@@ yed , shi@@ f@@ ted the bal@@ ance within music between in@@ st@@ in@@ ct and inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence way over to the in@@ st@@ in@@ ctive side ."
"The culture in which we live now is a@@ wa@@ sh with music of impro@@ vi@@ s@@ ation that &apos;s been sli@@ ced , di@@ ced , la@@ y@@ er@@ ed and , God know@@ s , di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted and s@@ old ."
What &apos;s the lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m effe@@ ct of this on us or on music ?
N@@ ob@@ ody know@@ s .
The question re@@ ma@@ ins : What happens when the music stop@@ s ?
What sti@@ cks with people ?
"Now that we have un@@ li@@ mi@@ ted ac@@ cess to music , what does sti@@ ck with us ?"
"Well let me show you a story of what I mean by &quot; &quot; really sti@@ c@@ king with us . &quot; &quot; I was visi@@ ting a cou@@ si@@ n of m@@ ine in an old age home , and I sp@@ ied a very sha@@ k@@ y old man making his way across the room on a wal@@ k@@ er ."
"He came over to a pi@@ ano that was there , and he bal@@ an@@ ced hi@@ m@@ self and began playing something like this ."
"( Music ) And he said something like , &quot; &quot; M@@ e ... bo@@ y ... sym@@ ph@@ ony ... Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven . &quot; &quot; And I sud@@ den@@ ly got it , and I said , &quot; &quot; F@@ r@@ iend , by any ch@@ ance are you trying to play this ? &quot; &quot; ( Music ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , y@@ es . I was a little bo@@ y ."
"The sym@@ ph@@ ony : I@@ sa@@ a@@ c S@@ ter@@ n , the con@@ cer@@ to , I heard it . &quot; &quot; And I thought , my God , how much must this music mean to this man that he would get hi@@ m@@ self out of his bed , across the room to re@@ co@@ ver the memor@@ y of this music that , after everything else in his life is sl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing away , still means so much to him ?"
"Well , that &apos;s why I take every perform@@ ance so seri@@ ously , why it mat@@ ters to me so much ."
"I never know who might be there , who might be ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing it and what will happen to it in their life ."
But now I &apos;m exci@@ ted that there &apos;s more ch@@ ance than ever before possible of sh@@ aring this music .
"That &apos;s what dri@@ ves my inter@@ est in proje@@ cts like the T@@ V ser@@ ies &quot; &quot; K@@ e@@ e@@ ping S@@ cor@@ e &quot; &quot; with the S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony that looks at the back@@ stories of music , and working with the young musi@@ ci@@ ans at the New World Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony on proje@@ cts that expl@@ ore the poten@@ tial of the new perform@@ ing ar@@ ts cen@@ ters for both en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment and education ."
"And of course , the New World Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony led to the Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony and proje@@ cts on the inter@@ net that re@@ ach out to musi@@ ci@@ ans and aud@@ ien@@ ces all over the world ."
And the exci@@ ting thing is all this is just a pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pe .
"There &apos;s just a ro@@ le here for so many people — teach@@ ers , parents , perform@@ ers — to be expl@@ or@@ ers together ."
"S@@ ure , the big ev@@ ents at@@ trac@@ t a lot of at@@ ten@@ tion , but what really mat@@ ters is what goes on every single day ."
"We need your perspe@@ cti@@ ves , your cu@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty , your vo@@ i@@ ces ."
"And it exci@@ tes me now to me@@ et people who are hi@@ k@@ ers , ch@@ ef@@ s , c@@ od@@ e wri@@ ters , ta@@ x@@ i dri@@ ver@@ s , people I never would have gu@@ ess@@ ed who lo@@ ved the music and who are pas@@ sing it on ."
You don &apos;t need to wor@@ ry about know@@ ing anything .

"To put these num@@ bers in perspe@@ ctive , this is eight times lar@@ ger than the number of c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ties in the I@@ ra@@ q and Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan war@@ s com@@ b@@ ined ."
"It &apos;s also sho@@ ck@@ ing@@ ly close to the number of people who have d@@ ied in the Sy@@ ri@@ an ci@@ vi@@ l war , which is an ac@@ tive ci@@ vi@@ l war ."
This is happening just s@@ outh of the bor@@ der .

"And the only way to do this , because it &apos;s il@@ leg@@ al , is to have absolu@@ te control of the ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors that are used to transpor@@ t dru@@ gs ."
H@@ ence the violence .
"If you look at a ma@@ p of car@@ te@@ l in@@ flu@@ ence and violence , you will see that it almost perfe@@ ct@@ ly ali@@ g@@ ns with the most ef@@ fi@@ cient rou@@ tes of transpor@@ tation from the s@@ outh to the nor@@ th ."
The only thing that the car@@ te@@ ls are doing is that they &apos;re trying to prote@@ ct their business .
"It &apos;s not only a mul@@ ti@@ -@@ billion dol@@ lar market , but it &apos;s also a comple@@ x one ."
"For example , the co@@ ca pl@@ ant is a fra@@ gi@@ le pl@@ ant that can only gro@@ w in certain l@@ ati@@ tu@@ des , and so it means that a business model to ad@@ dre@@ ss this market requi@@ res you to have de@@ cen@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed , inter@@ national produ@@ ction , that by the way needs to have good qu@@ ality control , because people need a good high that is not going to ki@@ ll them and that is going to be deli@@ vered to them when they need it ."
"And so that means they need to secu@@ re produ@@ ction and qu@@ ality control in the s@@ outh , and you need to en@@ sure that you have ef@@ fi@@ cient and effe@@ ctive di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion ch@@ an@@ ne@@ ls in the marke@@ ts where these dru@@ gs are con@@ sum@@ ed ."
"I ur@@ ge you , but only a little bit , because I don &apos;t want to get you in t@@ rou@@ ble , to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever dru@@ g you want , wh@@ er@@ ever you want it , wh@@ en@@ ever you want it , any@@ where in the U.@@ S. , and some of you may be sur@@ pri@@ sed to know that there are many de@@ al@@ ers that of@@ f@@ er a ser@@ vice where if you sen@@ d them a te@@ xt mess@@ age , they gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e deli@@ very of the dru@@ g in 30 minutes or less ."
Th@@ in@@ k about this for a second .
Th@@ in@@ k about the comple@@ x@@ ity of the di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion network that I just descri@@ bed .
"It &apos;s very difficult to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this with the image of fac@@ el@@ ess , ig@@ nor@@ ant go@@ ons that are just sho@@ ot@@ ing each other , very difficult to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le ."
"Now , as a business prof@@ ess@@ or , and as any business prof@@ ess@@ or would tell you , an effe@@ ctive organiz@@ ation requi@@ res an inte@@ gr@@ ated strate@@ gy that inclu@@ des a good organiz@@ ational structure , good in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves , a so@@ li@@ d iden@@ ti@@ ty and good br@@ and man@@ ag@@ ement ."
This le@@ ads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 3@@ 0-@@ minu@@ te expl@@ or@@ ation of dru@@ g violence in M@@ exi@@ co .
"Because you would quickly realize , and maybe be con@@ f@@ used by the fact , that there are three organiz@@ ations that are con@@ stan@@ tly na@@ med in the arti@@ cles ."
"You will hear about L@@ os Z@@ et@@ as , the K@@ ni@@ ghts T@@ em@@ pl@@ ar , which is the new br@@ and for the F@@ ami@@ li@@ a Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ ana that I spo@@ ke about at the beginning , and the S@@ in@@ al@@ o@@ a F@@ e@@ der@@ ation ."
"You will read that L@@ os Z@@ et@@ as is this as@@ sor@@ t@@ ment of so@@ ci@@ op@@ a@@ ths that terri@@ fy the cities that they enter and they sil@@ ence the pre@@ ss , and this is some@@ what true , or mo@@ st@@ ly true ."
But this is the resul@@ t of a very car@@ e@@ ful bran@@ ding and business strate@@ gy .
"You see , L@@ os Z@@ et@@ as is not just this ran@@ dom as@@ sor@@ t@@ ment of individu@@ als , but was actually created by another cri@@ min@@ al organiz@@ ation , the G@@ ul@@ f C@@ ar@@ te@@ l , that used to control the e@@ ast@@ er@@ n cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of M@@ exi@@ co ."
"When that cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or became con@@ test@@ ed , they decided that they wanted to re@@ c@@ ru@@ it a prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal en@@ for@@ c@@ ement ar@@ m ."
So they re@@ c@@ ru@@ i@@ ted L@@ os Z@@ et@@ as : an entire uni@@ t of e@@ li@@ te par@@ at@@ ro@@ op@@ ers from the M@@ exi@@ can Ar@@ my .
"They were incredi@@ bly effe@@ ctive as en@@ for@@ c@@ ers for the G@@ ul@@ f C@@ ar@@ te@@ l , so much so that at some point , they decided to just take over the oper@@ ations , which is why I ask you to never keep ti@@ g@@ ers as pe@@ ts , because they gro@@ w up ."
"Because the Z@@ et@@ as organiz@@ ation was f@@ oun@@ ded in tre@@ as@@ on , they lost some of the lin@@ k@@ ages to the produ@@ ction and di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion in the most pro@@ fi@@ table marke@@ ts like co@@ ca@@ ine , but what they did have , and this is again based on their mi@@ lit@@ ary ori@@ g@@ in , was a perfe@@ ct@@ ly stru@@ ctu@@ red cha@@ in of comm@@ and with a very clear h@@ ier@@ ar@@ chy and a very clear pro@@ moti@@ on pat@@ h that allow@@ ed them to super@@ vi@@ se and oper@@ ate across many , many marke@@ ts very effe@@ cti@@ vely , which is the essen@@ ce of what a cha@@ in of comm@@ and see@@ ks to do ."
"And so because they didn &apos;t have ac@@ cess to the more pro@@ fi@@ table dru@@ g marke@@ ts , this p@@ us@@ h@@ ed them and gave them the opportunity to di@@ ver@@ si@@ fy into other form@@ s of cri@@ me ."
"That inclu@@ des ki@@ d@@ na@@ pping , pro@@ stitu@@ tion , local dru@@ g de@@ al@@ ing and human traf@@ fi@@ c@@ king , inclu@@ ding of mi@@ gran@@ ts that go from the s@@ outh to the U.@@ S@@ ."
So what they cur@@ r@@ ently run is tru@@ ly and quite liter@@ ally a f@@ ran@@ chi@@ se business .
"They fo@@ cus most of their re@@ c@@ ru@@ i@@ ting on the ar@@ my , and they very open@@ ly ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se for better s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies , better b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts , better pro@@ moti@@ on pa@@ ths , not to men@@ tion much better food , than what the ar@@ my can deli@@ ver ."
"This kind of business model obvi@@ ously depen@@ ds enti@@ re@@ ly on having a very effe@@ ctive br@@ and of fe@@ ar , and so L@@ os Z@@ et@@ as car@@ e@@ fully st@@ age ac@@ ts of violence that are spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar in nature , es@@ pe@@ cially when they ar@@ ri@@ ve first in a city , but again , that &apos;s just a br@@ and strate@@ gy ."
"I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re not viol@@ ent , but what I am saying is that even though you will read that they are the most viol@@ ent of all , when you coun@@ t , when you do the body coun@@ t , they &apos;re actually all the same ."
"In con@@ tra@@ st to them , the K@@ ni@@ ghts T@@ em@@ pl@@ ar that aro@@ se in Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ á@@ n em@@ er@@ g@@ ed in re@@ action to the in@@ cur@@ sion of the Z@@ et@@ as into the state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ á@@ n ."
"M@@ i@@ cho@@ ac@@ á@@ n is a ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cally strate@@ gi@@ c state because it has one of the largest por@@ ts in M@@ exi@@ co , and it has very dire@@ ct rou@@ tes to the cen@@ ter of M@@ exi@@ co , which then gi@@ ves you dire@@ ct ac@@ cess to the U.@@ S@@ ."
"The K@@ ni@@ ghts T@@ em@@ pl@@ ar realized very quickly that they couldn &apos;t face the Z@@ et@@ as on violence alone , and so they develo@@ ped a strate@@ gy as a social en@@ ter@@ pri@@ se ."
They br@@ and themselves as re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative of and prote@@ cting of the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ á@@ n against organiz@@ ed cri@@ me .
"Th@@ e@@ ir br@@ and of social en@@ ter@@ pri@@ se means that they requi@@ re a lot of ci@@ vi@@ c eng@@ ag@@ ement , so they inv@@ est he@@ avi@@ ly in provi@@ ding local ser@@ vi@@ ces , like de@@ al@@ ing with home violence , going after pe@@ t@@ ty cri@@ min@@ als , tre@@ ating ad@@ di@@ cts , and ke@@ e@@ ping dru@@ gs out of the local marke@@ ts where they are , and , of course , prote@@ cting people from other cri@@ min@@ al organiz@@ ations ."
"Now , they ki@@ ll a lot of people too , but when they ki@@ ll them , they provi@@ de very car@@ e@@ ful nar@@ r@@ ati@@ ves and descri@@ p@@ tions for why they did them , through ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er in@@ ser@@ tions , Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be vi@@ de@@ os , and bi@@ ll@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds that expla@@ in that the people who were kil@@ led were kil@@ led because they re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted a thre@@ at not to us , as an organiz@@ ation , of course , but to you , as ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ."
And so we &apos;re actually here to prote@@ ct you .
"They , as social en@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses do , have created a mor@@ al and e@@ thi@@ cal c@@ od@@ e that they ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se around , and they have very stri@@ ct re@@ c@@ ru@@ i@@ ting prac@@ ti@@ ces ."
And here you have the typ@@ es of ex@@ plan@@ ations that they provi@@ de for some of their ac@@ tions .
"They have actually re@@ ta@@ ined ac@@ cess to the pro@@ fi@@ table dru@@ g tra@@ de , but the way they do it is , because they control all of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ á@@ n , and they control the P@@ or@@ t of L@@ á@@ zar@@ o C@@ á@@ r@@ den@@ as , they le@@ ver@@ age that to , for example , tra@@ de cop@@ per from Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ á@@ n that is leg@@ ally created and leg@@ ally ex@@ trac@@ ted with il@@ leg@@ al e@@ p@@ he@@ d@@ r@@ ine from China which is a cri@@ tical pre@@ cur@@ s@@ or for meth@@ am@@ p@@ he@@ tam@@ ines that they produ@@ ce , and then they have part@@ ner@@ ships with lar@@ ger organiz@@ ations like the S@@ in@@ al@@ o@@ a F@@ e@@ der@@ ation that place their produ@@ cts in the U.@@ S@@ ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , the S@@ in@@ al@@ o@@ a F@@ e@@ der@@ ation ."
"When you read about them , you will often read about them with an under@@ t@@ one of re@@ ver@@ ence and ad@@ mi@@ r@@ ation , because they are the most inte@@ gr@@ ated and the largest of all the M@@ exi@@ can organiz@@ ations , and , many people ar@@ gu@@ e , the world ."
They started as just sort of a transpor@@ t organiz@@ ation that speci@@ aliz@@ ed in s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ing between the U.@@ S.
"@@ and the M@@ exi@@ can bor@@ ders , but now they have grow@@ n into a tru@@ ly inte@@ gr@@ ated mul@@ t@@ in@@ ational that has part@@ ner@@ ships in produ@@ ction in the s@@ outh and part@@ ner@@ ships in global di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion across the planet ."
"They have cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ated a br@@ and of prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ ali@@ sm , business ac@@ um@@ en and in@@ no@@ vation ."
They have desig@@ ned new dru@@ g produ@@ cts and new dru@@ g pro@@ cess@@ es .
"They have desig@@ ned nar@@ co@@ -@@ tu@@ n@@ ne@@ ls that go across the bor@@ der , and you can see that these are not &quot; &quot; The S@@ ha@@ w@@ sh@@ ank Re@@ de@@ m@@ ption &quot; &quot; typ@@ es ."
They have inv@@ en@@ ted nar@@ co@@ -@@ sub@@ mar@@ ines and bo@@ ats that are not de@@ te@@ cted by ra@@ d@@ ar .
"They have inv@@ en@@ ted d@@ ron@@ es to transpor@@ t dru@@ gs , cat@@ a@@ pul@@ ts , you name it ."
One of the le@@ ad@@ ers of the S@@ in@@ al@@ o@@ a F@@ e@@ der@@ ation actually made it to the F@@ or@@ be@@ s li@@ st .
"@@ &#91; # 7@@ 0@@ 1 Jo@@ a@@ qu@@ in G@@ u@@ z@@ man L@@ o@@ era &#93; Li@@ ke any mul@@ t@@ in@@ ational would , they have speci@@ aliz@@ ed and fo@@ c@@ used only in the most pro@@ fi@@ table part of the business , which is high-@@ mar@@ g@@ in dru@@ gs like co@@ ca@@ ine , her@@ o@@ ine , meth@@ am@@ p@@ he@@ tam@@ ines ."
"L@@ i@@ ke any tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal L@@ at@@ in American mul@@ t@@ in@@ ational would , the way they control their oper@@ ations is through family ties ."
"When they &apos;re en@@ ter@@ ing a new market , they sen@@ d a family member to super@@ vi@@ se it , or , if they &apos;re part@@ ner@@ ing with a new organiz@@ ation , they create a family t@@ ie , either through mar@@ ri@@ ages or other typ@@ es of ties ."
"L@@ i@@ ke any other mul@@ t@@ in@@ ational would , they prote@@ ct their br@@ and by out@@ sour@@ cing the more questi@@ on@@ able par@@ ts of the business model , like for example , when they have to eng@@ age in violence against other cri@@ min@@ al organiz@@ ations , they re@@ c@@ ru@@ it g@@ an@@ gs and other s@@ mal@@ ler pla@@ y@@ ers to do the di@@ r@@ ty work for them , and they try to se@@ par@@ ate their oper@@ ations and their violence and be very di@@ scre@@ te about this ."
"To f@@ ur@@ ther str@@ eng@@ then their br@@ and , they actually have prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal P@@ .@@ R@@ . fir@@ ms that sha@@ pe how the pre@@ ss tal@@ ks about them ."
They have prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal vi@@ de@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ers on st@@ af@@ f .
They have incredi@@ bly produ@@ ctive ties with the secu@@ ri@@ ty organiz@@ ations on both si@@ des of the bor@@ der .
"And so , differ@@ ences a@@ side , what these three organiz@@ ations share is on the one hand , a very clear under@@ standing that institu@@ tions cannot be im@@ posed from the top , but rather they are built from the bot@@ tom up one inter@@ action at a time ."
They have created extre@@ me@@ ly co@@ her@@ ent stru@@ ctures that they use to show the in@@ consi@@ st@@ en@@ cies in government poli@@ cies .
And so what I want you to remember from this talk are three things .
The first one is that dru@@ g violence is actually the resul@@ t of a huge market de@@ m@@ and and an institu@@ ti@@ onal se@@ tu@@ p that for@@ ces the ser@@ vi@@ cing of this market to ne@@ ces@@ si@@ t@@ ate violence to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e deli@@ very rou@@ tes .
"The second thing I want you to remember is that these are s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated , co@@ her@@ ent organiz@@ ations that are business organiz@@ ations , and an@@ al@@ yz@@ ing them and tre@@ ating them as such is probably a much more us@@ e@@ ful appro@@ ach ."
"The third thing I want you to remember is that even though we &apos;re more comfor@@ table with this idea of &quot; &quot; them , &quot; &quot; a set of bad guys se@@ par@@ ated from us , we are actually ac@@ comp@@ li@@ ces to them , either through our dire@@ ct con@@ sum@@ ption or through our ac@@ cep@@ t@@ ance of the in@@ consi@@ st@@ en@@ cy between our poli@@ cies of pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion and our ac@@ tu@@ al behavi@@ or of t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance or even en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement of con@@ sum@@ ption ."
"These organiz@@ ations ser@@ vice , re@@ c@@ ru@@ it from , and oper@@ ate within our communi@@ ties , so ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly , they are much more inte@@ gr@@ ated within them than we are comfor@@ table ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ing ."
And so to me the question is not whether these dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs will contin@@ ue the way they have .
We see that the nature of this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es that they will .
"The question is whether we are wil@@ ling to contin@@ ue our sup@@ port of a fai@@ led strate@@ gy based on our stu@@ b@@ born , bli@@ s@@ s@@ ful , vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary ig@@ nor@@ ance at the cost of the de@@ a@@ ths of thousands of our young ."
Thank you .

"O@@ n Mar@@ ch 14 , this year , I post@@ ed this post@@ er on F@@ ace@@ book ."
This is an image of me and my d@@ aughter hol@@ ding the Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li f@@ la@@ g .
I will try to expla@@ in to you about the con@@ te@@ xt of why and when I post@@ ed .
"A few days ago , I was sitting wai@@ ting on the line at the gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e , and the ow@@ ner and one of the cl@@ ien@@ ts were talking to each other , and the ow@@ ner was expla@@ ining to the cl@@ ien@@ t that we &apos;re going to get 1@@ 0,000 mis@@ si@@ les on Is@@ ra@@ el ."
"And the cl@@ ien@@ t was saying , no , it &apos;s 1@@ 0,000 a day ."
"( Laughter ) ( &quot; &quot; 1@@ 0,000 mis@@ si@@ les &quot; &quot; ) This is the con@@ te@@ xt . This is where we are now in Is@@ ra@@ el ."
"We have this war with I@@ ran coming for 10 years now , and we have people , you know , af@@ ra@@ id ."
It &apos;s like every year it &apos;s the last minu@@ te that we can do something about the war with I@@ ran .
"It &apos;s like , if we don &apos;t act now , it &apos;s too l@@ ate fore@@ ver , for 10 years now ."
"So at some point it became , you know , to me , I &apos;m a gra@@ phi@@ c desig@@ ner , so I made post@@ ers about it and I post@@ ed the one I just show@@ ed you before ."
"Mo@@ st of the time , I make post@@ ers , I pos@@ t them on F@@ ace@@ book , my friends like it , don &apos;t like it , most of the time don &apos;t like it , don &apos;t share it , don &apos;t nothing , and it &apos;s another day ."
"So I went to sle@@ ep , and that was it for me ."
"And later on in the night , I wo@@ ke up because I &apos;m always wa@@ king up in the night , and I went by the computer and I see all these red d@@ ots , you know , on F@@ ace@@ book , which I &apos;ve never seen before ."
"( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; So I come to the computer and I start looking on , and sud@@ den@@ ly I see many people talking to me , most of them I don &apos;t know , and a few of them from I@@ ran , which is — What ?"
"Because you have to understand , in Is@@ ra@@ el we don &apos;t talk with people from I@@ ran ."
We don &apos;t know people from I@@ ran .
"It &apos;s like , on F@@ ace@@ book , you have friends only from — it &apos;s like your neigh@@ b@@ ors are your friends on F@@ ace@@ book ."
And now people from I@@ ran are talking to me .
"So I start ans@@ wer@@ ing this girl , and she &apos;s tel@@ ling me she saw the post@@ er and she asked her family to come , because they don &apos;t have a computer , she asked her family to come to see the post@@ er , and they &apos;re all sitting in the living room c@@ ry@@ ing ."
"So I &apos;m like , wh@@ o@@ a ."
"I ask my wi@@ fe to come , and I tell her , you have to see that ."
"P@@ e@@ ople are c@@ ry@@ ing , and she came , she read the te@@ xt , and she started to c@@ ry ."
"And everybody &apos;s c@@ ry@@ ing now . ( Laughter ) So I don &apos;t know what to do , so my first ref@@ le@@ x , as a gra@@ phi@@ c desig@@ ner , is , you know , to show everybody what I &apos;d just seen , and people started to see them and to share them , and that &apos;s how it started ."
"The day after , when really it became a lot of talking , I said to myself , and my wi@@ fe said to me , I also want a post@@ er , so this is her . ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s working , put me in a post@@ er now ."
"But more seri@@ ously , I was like , o@@ kay , these ones work , but it &apos;s not just about me , it &apos;s about people from Is@@ ra@@ el who want to say something ."
"So I &apos;m going to sho@@ ot all the people I know , if they want , and I &apos;m going to put them in a post@@ er and I &apos;m going to share them ."
"So I went to my neigh@@ b@@ ors and friends and students and I just asked them , give me a picture , I will make you a post@@ er ."
"And that &apos;s how it started . And that &apos;s how , really , it &apos;s un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed , because sud@@ den@@ ly people from F@@ ace@@ book , friends and others , just understand that they can be part of it ."
"It &apos;s not just one du@@ de making one post@@ er , it &apos;s — we can be part of it , so they start sen@@ ding me pi@@ ctures and ask me , &quot; &quot; M@@ ake me a post@@ er . Po@@ st it ."
"T@@ ell the I@@ rani@@ ans we from Is@@ ra@@ el love you too . &quot; &quot; It became , you know , at some point it was really , really inten@@ se ."
"I mean , so many pi@@ ctures , so I asked friends to come , gra@@ phi@@ c desig@@ n@@ ers most of them , to make post@@ ers with me , because I didn &apos;t have the time ."
It was a huge amount of pi@@ ctures .
"So for a few days , that &apos;s how my living room was ."
"And we re@@ cei@@ ved Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li post@@ ers , Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li images , but also lots of com@@ ments , lots of mess@@ ages from I@@ ran ."
"And we took these mess@@ ages and we made post@@ ers out of it , because I know people : They don &apos;t read , they see images ."
"If it &apos;s an image , they may read it ."
So here are a few of them .
"( &quot; &quot; You are my first Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li@@ an friend . I wi@@ sh we both get ri@@ d of our i@@ di@@ ot poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans , any@@ way nice to see you ! &quot; &quot; ) ( &quot; &quot; I love that blue . I love that st@@ ar . I love that f@@ la@@ g . &quot; &quot; ) This one is really moving for me because it &apos;s the story of a girl who has been ra@@ is@@ ed in I@@ ran to walk on an Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li f@@ la@@ g to enter her school every morning , and now that she se@@ es the post@@ ers that we &apos;re sen@@ ding , she star@@ ts — she said that she changed her mind , and now she lo@@ ves that blue , she lo@@ ves that st@@ ar , and she lo@@ ves that f@@ la@@ g , talking about the Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li f@@ la@@ g ,"
"@@ and she wi@@ shed that we &apos;d me@@ et and come to visi@@ t one another , and just a few days after I post@@ ed the first post@@ er ."
"The day after , I@@ rani@@ ans started to re@@ spo@@ nd with their own post@@ ers ."
"They have gra@@ phi@@ c desig@@ n@@ ers . What ? ( Laughter ) C@@ razy , c@@ razy ."
"So you can see they are still sh@@ y , they don &apos;t want to show their fac@@ es , but they want to sp@@ read the mess@@ age ."
They want to re@@ spo@@ nd . They want to say the same thing .
So . And now it &apos;s communi@@ cation .
"It &apos;s a two@@ -@@ way story . It &apos;s Is@@ ra@@ el@@ is and I@@ rani@@ ans sen@@ ding the same mess@@ age , one to each other ."
"( &quot; &quot; My Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li F@@ r@@ ien@@ ds . I don &apos;t h@@ ate you . I don &apos;t want W@@ ar . &quot; &quot; ) This never happened before , and this is two people sup@@ posed to be ene@@ mie@@ s , we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of a war , and sud@@ den@@ ly people on F@@ ace@@ book are star@@ ting to say , &quot; I like this guy . I love those guys . &quot;"
And it became really big at some point .
And then it became news .
"Because when you &apos;re seeing the Mi@@ ddle E@@ ast , you see only the bad news ."
"And sud@@ den@@ ly , there is something that was happening that was good news . So the guys on the news , they say , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , let &apos;s talk about this . &quot; &quot; And they just came , and it was so much , I remember one day , Mi@@ ch@@ al , she was talking with the jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st , and she was as@@ king him , &quot; Wh@@ o &apos;s g@@ on@@ na see the show ? &quot; And he said , &quot; E@@ very@@ body . &quot;"
"So she said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ body in P@@ al@@ est@@ ine , in where ? Is@@ ra@@ el ?"
"Wh@@ o is everybody ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ body . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Sy@@ ri@@ a ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sy@@ ri@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ ban@@ on ? &quot; &quot; Le@@ ban@@ on . &quot;"
"A@@ t some point , he just said , &quot; &quot; 40 million people are going to see you today ."
It &apos;s everybody . &quot; &quot; The Chin@@ ese .
And we were just at the beginning of the story .
S@@ ome@@ thing c@@ razy also happened .
"E@@ very time a country started talking about it , like G@@ er@@ many , America , wh@@ er@@ ever , a p@@ age on F@@ ace@@ book po@@ pped up with the same lo@@ go with the same stories , so at the beginning we had &quot; &quot; I@@ ran@@ -@@ L@@ o@@ v@@ es@@ -@@ Is@@ ra@@ el , &quot; &quot; which is an I@@ rani@@ an sitting in T@@ e@@ h@@ ran , saying , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , Is@@ ra@@ el lo@@ ves I@@ ran ?"
I give you I@@ ran@@ -@@ L@@ o@@ v@@ es@@ -@@ Is@@ ra@@ el . &quot; &quot; You have P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ e-@@ L@@ o@@ v@@ es@@ -@@ Is@@ ra@@ el .
You have Le@@ ban@@ on that just — a few days ago .
"And this whole li@@ st of p@@ ages on F@@ ace@@ book de@@ di@@ c@@ ated to the same mess@@ age , to people sen@@ ding their love , one to each other ."
"The moment I really under@@ sto@@ od that something was happening , a friend of m@@ ine told me , &quot; Go@@ og@@ le the word &apos; Is@@ ra@@ el . &apos; &quot; And those were the first images on those days that po@@ pped up from Go@@ og@@ le when you were ty@@ ping , &quot; &quot; Is@@ ra@@ el &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; I@@ ran . &quot; &quot; We really changed how people see the Mi@@ ddle E@@ ast ."
Because you &apos;re not in the Mi@@ ddle E@@ ast .
"You &apos;re some@@ where over there , and then you want to see the Mi@@ ddle E@@ ast , so you go on Go@@ og@@ le and you say , &quot; &quot; Is@@ ra@@ el , &quot; &quot; and they give you the bad stuff ."
And for a few days you got those images .
"T@@ od@@ ay the Is@@ ra@@ el@@ -@@ L@@ o@@ v@@ es@@ -@@ I@@ ran p@@ age is this number , 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 8@@ 3@@ 1 , and two million people last week went on the p@@ age and sh@@ ared , li@@ ked , I don &apos;t know , com@@ men@@ ted on one of the ph@@ ot@@ os ."
"So for five months now , that &apos;s what we are doing , me , Mi@@ ch@@ al , a few of my friends , are just making images ."
We &apos;re show@@ ing a new re@@ ality by just making images because that &apos;s how the world per@@ cei@@ ves us .
"They see images of us , and they see bad images ."
So we &apos;re working on making good images . E@@ nd of story .
L@@ ook at this one . This is the I@@ ran@@ -@@ L@@ o@@ v@@ es@@ -@@ Is@@ ra@@ el p@@ age .
This is not the Is@@ ra@@ el@@ -@@ L@@ o@@ v@@ es@@ -@@ I@@ ran . This is not my p@@ age .
This is a guy in T@@ e@@ h@@ ran on the day of re@@ mem@@ bran@@ ce of the Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li fal@@ le@@ n sol@@ d@@ ier pu@@ tting an image of an Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li sol@@ d@@ ier on his p@@ age .

"It &apos;s like , we are show@@ ing re@@ spe@@ ct , one to each other ."
And we &apos;re under@@ standing . And you show comp@@ as@@ sion .
And you become friends .
"And at some point , you become friends on F@@ ace@@ book , and you become friends in life ."
You can go and tra@@ vel and me@@ et people .
And I was in M@@ uni@@ ch a few weeks ago .
"I went there to open an ex@@ posi@@ tion about I@@ ran and I met there with people from the p@@ age that told me , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , you &apos;re going to be in Europ@@ e , I &apos;m coming . I &apos;m coming from Fran@@ ce , from H@@ ol@@ land , from G@@ er@@ many , &quot; &quot; of course , and from Is@@ ra@@ el people came , and we just met there for the first time in real life ."
"I met with people that are sup@@ posed to be my ene@@ mie@@ s for the first time . And we just sha@@ ke h@@ ands , and have a co@@ f@@ fe@@ e and a nice di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion , and we talk about food and bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball ."
And that was the end of it .
Re@@ member that image from the beginning ?
"A@@ t some point we met in real life , and we became friends ."
And it goes the other way around .
"S@@ ome girl that we met on F@@ ace@@ book never been in Is@@ ra@@ el , born and ra@@ is@@ ed in I@@ ran , lives in G@@ er@@ many , af@@ ra@@ id of Is@@ ra@@ el@@ is because of what she know@@ s about us , deci@@ des after a few months of talking on the Inter@@ net with some Is@@ ra@@ el@@ is to come to Is@@ ra@@ el , and she gets on the pl@@ ane and ar@@ ri@@ ves at B@@ en G@@ u@@ ri@@ on and says , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , not that big a deal . &quot; &quot; So a few weeks ago , the stre@@ ss is getting high@@ er , so we start this new cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n called &quot; &quot; N@@ ot ready to die in your war . &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s p@@ lu@@ s / min@@ us the same mess@@ age , but we wanted really to ad@@ d some ag@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vity to it ."
"And again , something amazing happened , something that we didn &apos;t have on the first wa@@ ve of the cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n ."
"Now people from I@@ ran , the same ones who were sh@@ y at the first cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n and just s@@ ent , you know , their fo@@ ot and half their fac@@ es , now they &apos;re sen@@ ding their fac@@ es , and they &apos;re saying , &quot; O@@ kay , no problem , we &apos;re into it . We are with you . &quot;"
J@@ ust read where those guys are from .
"And for every guy from Is@@ ra@@ el , you &apos;ve got someone from I@@ ran ."
J@@ ust people sen@@ ding their pi@@ ctures .
"C@@ razy , y@@ es ?"
"So — ( Applause ) So you may ask yourself , who is this du@@ de ?"
"My name is R@@ on@@ ny E@@ d@@ ry , and I &apos;m 4@@ 1 , I &apos;m an Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li , I &apos;m a father of two , I &apos;m a h@@ us@@ b@@ and , and I &apos;m a gra@@ phi@@ c desig@@ ner . I &apos;m teach@@ ing gra@@ phi@@ c design ."
"And I &apos;m not that na@@ i@@ ve , because a lot of the time I &apos;ve been asked , many times I &apos;ve been asked , &quot; &quot; Yeah , but , this is really na@@ i@@ ve , sen@@ ding f@@ low@@ ers over , I mean — &quot; &quot; I was in the ar@@ my . I was in the par@@ at@@ ro@@ op@@ ers for three years , and I know how it looks from the ground ."
I know how it can look really bad .
"So to me , this is the cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous thing to do , to try to re@@ ach the other side before it &apos;s too l@@ ate , because when it &apos;s going to be too l@@ ate , it &apos;s going to be too l@@ ate ."
"And sometimes war is in@@ evi@@ table , sometimes , but maybe &#91; with &#93; ef@@ for@@ t , we can av@@ o@@ id it ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe as people , because es@@ pe@@ cially in Is@@ ra@@ el , we &apos;re in a de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y . We have the fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ e@@ ch , and maybe that little thing can change something ."
"And really , we can be our own am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ ors ."
We can just sen@@ d a mess@@ age and hope for the best .
"So I want to ask Mi@@ ch@@ al , my wi@@ fe , to come with me on the st@@ age just to make with you one image , because it &apos;s all about images ."
And maybe that image will help us change something .
J@@ ust ra@@ ise that . E@@ x@@ actly .
"And I &apos;m just going to take a picture of it , and I &apos;m just going to pos@@ t it on F@@ ace@@ book with kind of &quot; &quot; Is@@ ra@@ el@@ is for pe@@ ace &quot; &quot; or something ."
Oh my God .
D@@ on &apos;t c@@ ry .
Thank you guys .
( Applause )
"The fra@@ gran@@ ce that you will s@@ me@@ ll , you will never be able to s@@ me@@ ll this way again ."
"It ’ s a fra@@ gran@@ ce called Be@@ y@@ ond Par@@ ad@@ ise , which you can find in any stor@@ e in the n@@ ation ."
"E@@ x@@ cept here it ’ s been sp@@ li@@ t up in par@@ ts by E@@ st@@ é@@ e L@@ au@@ der and by the per@@ f@@ um@@ er who did it , C@@ ali@@ ce Be@@ ck@@ er , and I &apos;m most gr@@ ate@@ ful to them for this ."
And it ’ s been sp@@ li@@ t up in suc@@ ces@@ sive bi@@ ts and a ch@@ or@@ d .
So what you ’ re s@@ me@@ l@@ ling now is the top not@@ e .
"And then will come what they call the heart , the l@@ us@@ h heart not@@ e ."
I will show it to you .
The E@@ den top not@@ e is na@@ med after the E@@ den Pro@@ je@@ ct in the U.@@ K@@ .
"The l@@ us@@ h heart not@@ e , M@@ el@@ ale@@ u@@ ca bar@@ k not@@ e — which does not con@@ tain any M@@ el@@ ale@@ u@@ ca bar@@ k , because it ’ s tot@@ ally for@@ bi@@ d@@ den ."
"And after that , the comple@@ te fra@@ gran@@ ce ."
"Now what you are s@@ me@@ l@@ ling is a com@@ bin@@ ation of — I asked how many mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les there were in there , and no@@ body would tell me ."
"So I put it through a G@@ .@@ C@@ . , a G@@ as Ch@@ ro@@ mat@@ ogra@@ ph that I have in my offi@@ ce , and it ’ s about 4@@ 00 ."
"So what you ’ re s@@ me@@ l@@ ling is se@@ ver@@ al hundre@@ d mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les flo@@ ating through the air , hi@@ tting your no@@ se ."
And do not get the im@@ pres@@ sion that this is very sub@@ je@@ ctive .
"You are all s@@ me@@ l@@ ling pretty much the same thing , OK ?"
S@@ me@@ ll has this re@@ pu@@ tation of being some@@ what different for each person .
It ’ s not really true .
"And per@@ f@@ um@@ ery shows you that can ’ t be true , because if it were like that it wouldn ’ t be an art , OK ?"
"Now , while the s@@ me@@ ll wa@@ f@@ ts over you , let me tell you the history of an idea ."
"E@@ very@@ thing that you ’ re s@@ me@@ l@@ ling in here is made up of at@@ oms that come from what I call the U@@ pp@@ er E@@ ast S@@ i@@ de of the per@@ i@@ od@@ ic table — a nice , sa@@ fe neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
( Laughter ) You really don ’ t want to leave it if you want to have a car@@ e@@ er in per@@ f@@ um@@ ery .
"S@@ ome people have tr@@ ied in the 19@@ 20@@ s to ad@@ d things from the bad par@@ ts , and it didn ’ t really work ."
"These are the five at@@ oms from which just about everything that you ’ re going to s@@ me@@ ll in real life , from co@@ f@@ fe@@ e to fra@@ gran@@ ce , are made of ."
"The top not@@ e that you s@@ me@@ l@@ led at the very beginning , the cu@@ t-@@ gra@@ ss green , what we call in per@@ f@@ um@@ ery — they ’ re we@@ ird terms — and this would be called a green not@@ e , because it s@@ me@@ l@@ ls of something green , like cut gra@@ ss ."
This is ci@@ s@@ -@@ 3@@ -@@ h@@ ex@@ ene@@ -@@ 1@@ -@@ ol . And I had to learn chemi@@ stry on the f@@ ly in the last three years . A very ex@@ pen@@ sive high school chemi@@ stry education .
"This has six car@@ b@@ on at@@ oms , so &quot; &quot; h@@ ex@@ a , &quot; &quot; h@@ ex@@ ene@@ -@@ 1@@ -@@ ol ."
"It has one d@@ ou@@ ble b@@ ond , it has an al@@ co@@ ho@@ l on the end , so it ’ s &quot; &quot; ol , &quot; &quot; and that ’ s why they call it ci@@ s@@ -@@ 3@@ -@@ h@@ ex@@ ene@@ -@@ 1@@ -@@ ol ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you figure this out , you can really im@@ pre@@ ss people at par@@ ties ."
"This s@@ me@@ l@@ ls of cut gra@@ ss . Now , this is the sk@@ ele@@ ton of the mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le ."
"If you dre@@ ss it up with at@@ oms , hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en at@@ oms — that ’ s what it looks like when you have it on your computer — but actually it ’ s sort of more like this , in the sense that the at@@ oms have a certain sp@@ here that you cannot pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ate . They re@@ pe@@ l ."
"O@@ K , now . Why does this thing s@@ me@@ ll of cut gra@@ ss , OK ?"
"Wh@@ y doesn ’ t it s@@ me@@ ll of pot@@ at@@ o@@ es or vi@@ o@@ le@@ ts ? Well , there are really two the@@ or@@ ies ."
But the first the@@ ory is : it must be the sha@@ pe .
And that ’ s a perfe@@ ct@@ ly reas@@ on@@ able the@@ ory in the sense that almost everything else in bio@@ logy works by sha@@ pe .
"E@@ n@@ zy@@ mes that che@@ w things up , anti@@ bod@@ ies , it ’ s all , you know , the f@@ it between a prote@@ in and whatever it is gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing , in this case a s@@ me@@ ll ."
And I will try and expla@@ in to you what ’ s wrong with this noti@@ on .
And the other the@@ ory is that we s@@ me@@ ll mo@@ le@@ cular vi@@ br@@ ations .
"Now , this is a tot@@ ally in@@ s@@ ane idea ."
"And when I first came across it in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s , I thought my pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or , M@@ al@@ col@@ m D@@ y@@ son and Bo@@ b W@@ right , had really taken leave of their sen@@ ses , and I ’ ll expla@@ in to you why this was the case ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , I came to realize gra@@ du@@ ally that they may be right — and I have to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce all my colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es that this is so , but I ’ m working on it ."
Here ’ s how sha@@ pe works in nor@@ mal re@@ cep@@ t@@ ors .
"You have a mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le coming in , it gets into the prote@@ in , which is sch@@ em@@ atic here , and it ca@@ uses this thing to s@@ wit@@ ch , to turn , to move in some way by bin@@ ding in certain par@@ ts ."
"And the at@@ trac@@ tion , the for@@ ces , between the mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le and the prote@@ in cause the moti@@ on . This is a sha@@ pe@@ -@@ based idea ."
"Now , what ’ s wrong with sha@@ pe is sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed in this sli@@ de ."
The way — I expe@@ ct everybody to memor@@ i@@ ze these com@@ po@@ un@@ ds .
"This is one p@@ age of work from a chemi@@ st ’ s wor@@ k@@ book , OK ?"
Wor@@ king for a fra@@ gran@@ ce company .
"He ’ s making 4@@ 5 mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les , and he ’ s looking for a s@@ and@@ al@@ wood , something that s@@ me@@ l@@ ls of s@@ and@@ al@@ wood ."
Because there ’ s a lot of money in s@@ and@@ al@@ wo@@ ods .
"And of these 4@@ 5 mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les , only 4@@ 6@@ 2@@ 9 actually s@@ me@@ l@@ ls of s@@ and@@ al@@ wood ."
"And he pu@@ ts an ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ation mar@@ k , OK ? This is an aw@@ ful lot of work ."
"This actually is rou@@ gh@@ ly , in man@@ -@@ years of work , 200@@ ,000 dollars rou@@ gh@@ ly , if you keep them on the low s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies with no b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts ."
So this is a prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly in@@ ef@@ fi@@ cient process .
"And my defini@@ tion of a the@@ ory is , it ’ s not just something that you te@@ ach people ; it ’ s lab@@ or sa@@ ving ."
A the@@ ory is something that en@@ ab@@ les you to do less work .
I love the idea of doing less work . So let me expla@@ in to you why — a very simple fact that tel@@ ls you why this sha@@ pe the@@ ory really does not work very well .
This is ci@@ s@@ -@@ 3@@ -@@ h@@ ex@@ ene@@ -@@ 1@@ -@@ ol . It s@@ me@@ l@@ ls of cut gra@@ ss .
"This is ci@@ s@@ -@@ 3@@ -@@ h@@ ex@@ ene@@ -@@ 1@@ -@@ thi@@ ol , and this s@@ me@@ l@@ ls of ro@@ t@@ ten e@@ g@@ gs , OK ?"
"Now , you will have noti@@ ced that v@@ od@@ ka never s@@ me@@ l@@ ls of ro@@ t@@ ten e@@ g@@ gs ."
"If it does , you put the gl@@ as@@ s down , you go to a different b@@ ar ."
"This is — in other words , we never get the O@@ -@@ H — we never mist@@ ake it for an S@@ -@@ H , OK ?"
"L@@ i@@ ke , at no con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation , even pu@@ re , you know , if you s@@ me@@ l@@ t pu@@ re e@@ th@@ an@@ ol , it doesn ’ t s@@ me@@ ll of ro@@ t@@ ten e@@ g@@ gs ."
"C@@ on@@ ver@@ se@@ ly , there is no con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation at which the sul@@ fu@@ r com@@ po@@ u@@ nd will s@@ me@@ ll like v@@ od@@ ka ."
It ’ s very hard to expla@@ in this by mo@@ le@@ cular re@@ cogni@@ tion .
"Now , I show@@ ed this to a physi@@ ci@@ st friend of m@@ ine who has a pro@@ found di@@ st@@ ast@@ e for bio@@ logy , and he says , &quot; &quot; That ’ s e@@ asy ! The things are a different color ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We have to go a little be@@ y@@ ond that . Now let me expla@@ in why vi@@ br@@ ational the@@ ory has some sort of inter@@ est in it . These mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les , as you saw in the beginning , the building blo@@ cks had sp@@ r@@ ings conne@@ cting them to each other ."
"In fact , mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les are able to vi@@ br@@ ate at a set of fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cies which are very speci@@ fic for each mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le and for the b@@ on@@ ds conne@@ cting them ."
"So this is the sound of the O@@ -@@ H stre@@ t@@ ch , trans@@ lated into the au@@ di@@ ble r@@ ange ."
"S@@ -@@ H , quite a different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy ."
"Now , this is kind of interesting , because it tel@@ ls you that you should be looking for a particular fact , which is this : nothing in the world s@@ me@@ l@@ ls like ro@@ t@@ ten e@@ g@@ gs ex@@ cept S@@ -@@ H , OK ?"
"Now , F@@ act B : nothing in the world has that fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy ex@@ cept S@@ -@@ H ."
"If you look on this , imagine a pi@@ ano ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard ."
"The S@@ -@@ H stre@@ t@@ ch is in the mi@@ ddle of a part of the ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard that has been , so to speak , dam@@ aged , and there are no neigh@@ bor@@ ing not@@ es , nothing is close to it ."
"You have a uni@@ qu@@ e s@@ me@@ ll , a uni@@ qu@@ e vi@@ br@@ ation ."
So I went sear@@ ching when I started in this g@@ ame to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce myself that there was any de@@ gre@@ e of pl@@ au@@ si@@ bility to this whole c@@ razy story .
"I went sear@@ ching for a ty@@ pe of mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le , any mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le , that would have that vi@@ br@@ ation and that — the obvi@@ ous pre@@ di@@ ction was that it should absolu@@ tely s@@ me@@ ll of sul@@ fu@@ r ."
"If it didn ’ t , the whole idea was to@@ ast , and I might as well move on to other things ."
"Now , after sear@@ ching high and low for se@@ ver@@ al months , I disco@@ vered that there was a ty@@ pe of mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le called a B@@ or@@ ane which has exactly the same vi@@ br@@ ation ."
"Now the good news is , B@@ or@@ an@@ es you can get h@@ old of ."
The bad news is they ’ re ro@@ ck@@ et fu@@ els .
"Mo@@ st of them ex@@ plo@@ de spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously in cont@@ act with air , and when you call up the comp@@ an@@ ies , they only give you min@@ i@@ mu@@ m ten t@@ ons , OK ?"
"( Laughter ) So this was not what they call a labor@@ at@@ ory@@ -@@ scale experim@@ ent , and they wouldn ’ t have li@@ ked it at my colle@@ ge ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , I man@@ aged to get a h@@ old of a B@@ or@@ ane ev@@ en@@ tually , and here is the be@@ ast ."
"And it really does have the same — if you cal@@ cul@@ ate , if you meas@@ ure the vi@@ br@@ ational fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cies , they are the same as S@@ -@@ H ."
"Now , does it s@@ me@@ ll of sul@@ fu@@ r ? Well , if you go back in the liter@@ ature , there ’ s a man who knew more about B@@ or@@ an@@ es than any@@ one ali@@ ve then or since , Al@@ f@@ red S@@ to@@ ck , he syn@@ the@@ si@@ zed all of them ."
"And in an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous 4@@ 0-@@ p@@ age pa@@ per in G@@ er@@ man he says , at one point — my wi@@ fe is G@@ er@@ man and she trans@@ lated it for me — and at one point he says , &quot; &quot; g@@ an@@ z wi@@ der@@ li@@ ch G@@ er@@ u@@ ch , &quot; &quot; an &quot; &quot; absolu@@ tely re@@ pul@@ sive s@@ me@@ ll , &quot; &quot; which is good . R@@ em@@ ini@@ sc@@ ent of hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en sul@@ fi@@ de ."
"So this fact that B@@ or@@ an@@ es s@@ me@@ ll of sul@@ fu@@ r had been known since 19@@ 10 , and ut@@ ter@@ ly for@@ got@@ ten until 199@@ 7 , 199@@ 8 ."
"Now , the s@@ light f@@ ly in the o@@ in@@ t@@ ment is this : that if we s@@ me@@ ll mo@@ le@@ cular vi@@ br@@ ations , we must have a spe@@ c@@ tro@@ sc@@ op@@ e in our no@@ se ."
"Now , this is a spe@@ c@@ tro@@ sc@@ op@@ e , OK , on my labor@@ at@@ ory b@@ en@@ ch ."
"And it ’ s fa@@ ir to say that if you look up somebody ’ s no@@ se , you ’ re un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly to see anything re@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ling this ."
And this is the ma@@ in obje@@ ction to the the@@ ory .
"O@@ K , great , we s@@ me@@ ll vi@@ br@@ ations . How ? All right ?"
"Now when people ask this kind of question , they neg@@ le@@ ct something , which is that physi@@ ci@@ sts are really cle@@ ver , un@@ like biologi@@ sts ."
"( Laughter ) This is a jo@@ ke . I ’ m a biologi@@ st , OK ?"
So it ’ s a jo@@ ke against myself .
"B@@ o@@ b J@@ ac@@ k@@ lo@@ v@@ ich and Joh@@ n L@@ am@@ b at F@@ or@@ d M@@ ot@@ or C@@ om@@ p@@ any , in the days when F@@ or@@ d M@@ ot@@ or was sp@@ ending v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of money on fundam@@ ent@@ al research , disco@@ vered a way to build a spe@@ c@@ tro@@ sc@@ op@@ e that was in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ cally n@@ an@@ o@@ -@@ scale ."
"In other words , no mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r@@ s , no las@@ ers , no pri@@ s@@ ms , no n@@ on@@ sense , just a t@@ iny de@@ vice , and he built this de@@ vice . And this de@@ vice uses ele@@ c@@ tro@@ n tu@@ n@@ ne@@ ling ."
"Now , I could do the dance of ele@@ c@@ tro@@ n tu@@ n@@ ne@@ ling , but I ’ ve done a video instead , which is much more interesting . Here ’ s how it works ."
"E@@ le@@ c@@ tro@@ ns are fu@@ z@@ zy cre@@ at@@ ures , and they can j@@ um@@ p across g@@ ap@@ s , but only at equ@@ al energy . If the energy dif@@ f@@ ers , they can ’ t j@@ um@@ p ."
"U@@ n@@ like us , they won ’ t f@@ all off the cli@@ ff ."
"O@@ K . Now . If something ab@@ sor@@ b@@ s the energy , the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ n can tra@@ vel ."
"So here you have a system , you have something — and there ’ s pl@@ en@@ ty of that stuff in bio@@ logy — some sub@@ stance gi@@ ving an ele@@ c@@ tro@@ n , and the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ n tries to j@@ um@@ p , and only when a mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le comes along that has the right vi@@ br@@ ation does the re@@ action happen , OK ?"
This is the basi@@ s for the de@@ vice that these two guys at F@@ or@@ d built .
And every single part of this mechani@@ sm is actually pl@@ au@@ si@@ ble in bio@@ logy .
"In other words , I ’ ve taken of@@ f-@@ the@@ -@@ sh@@ el@@ f com@@ pon@@ ents , and I ’ ve made a spe@@ c@@ tro@@ sc@@ op@@ e ."
"What ’ s nice about this idea , if you have a phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ hi@@ cal b@@ ent of mind , is that then it tel@@ ls you that the no@@ se , the e@@ ar and the ey@@ e are all vi@@ br@@ ational sen@@ ses ."
"O@@ f course , it doesn ’ t matter , because it could also be that they ’ re not ."
But it has a certain — ( Laughter ) — it has a certain ring to it which is at@@ trac@@ tive to people who read too much 19@@ th@@ -@@ century G@@ er@@ man liter@@ ature .
"And then a mag@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent thing happened : I left ac@@ a@@ demi@@ a and jo@@ ined the real world of business , and a company was created around my ideas to make new mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les using my meth@@ od , along the lin@@ es of , let ’ s put someone else ’ s money where your m@@ outh is ."
"And one of the first things that happened was we started going around to fra@@ gran@@ ce comp@@ an@@ ies as@@ king for what they needed , because , of course , if you could cal@@ cul@@ ate s@@ me@@ ll , you don ’ t need chemi@@ sts ."
"You need a computer , a Ma@@ c will do it , if you know how to program the thing right , OK ? So you can try a thous@@ and mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les , you can try ten thous@@ and mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les in a we@@ ek@@ end , and then you only tell the chemi@@ sts to make the right one ."
And so that ’ s a dire@@ ct pat@@ h to making new od@@ or@@ an@@ ts .
"And one of the first things that happened was we went to see some per@@ f@@ um@@ ers in Fran@@ ce — and here ’ s where I do my Ch@@ ar@@ les F@@ le@@ is@@ ch@@ er im@@ pres@@ sion — and one of them says , &quot; &quot; You cannot make a cou@@ mar@@ in . &quot; &quot; He says to me , &quot; &quot; I be@@ t you cannot make a cou@@ mar@@ in . &quot; &quot; Now , cou@@ mar@@ in is a very common thing , a materi@@ al , in fra@@ gran@@ ce which is der@@ i@@ ved from a be@@ an that comes from S@@ outh America ."
"And it is the clas@@ si@@ c syn@@ the@@ tic aro@@ ma chemi@@ cal , OK ?"
"It ’ s the mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le that has made men ’ s fra@@ gran@@ ces s@@ me@@ ll the way they do since 1@@ 8@@ 8@@ 1 , to be ex@@ act ."
And the problem is it ’ s a car@@ cin@@ og@@ en .
"So no@@ body li@@ k@@ es parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly to — you know , af@@ ter@@ s@@ have with car@@ cin@@ og@@ ens ."
"( Laughter ) There are some re@@ ck@@ less people , but it ’ s not wor@@ th it , OK ?"
So they asked us to make a new cou@@ mar@@ in . And so we started doing cal@@ cul@@ ations .
"And the first thing you do is you cal@@ cul@@ ate the vi@@ br@@ ational spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of cou@@ mar@@ in , and you smo@@ ot@@ h it out , so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of ch@@ or@@ d , so to speak , of cou@@ mar@@ in is ."
"And then you start c@@ ran@@ king the computer to find other mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les , re@@ lated or un@@ re@@ lated , that have the same vi@@ br@@ ations ."
"And we actually , in this case , I ’ m sor@@ ry to say , it happened — it was ser@@ en@@ di@@ pit@@ ous ."
"Because I got a phone call from our ch@@ ie@@ f chemi@@ st and he said , look , I ’ ve just found this such a beautiful re@@ action , that even if this com@@ po@@ u@@ nd doesn ’ t s@@ me@@ ll of cou@@ mar@@ in , I want to do it , it ’ s just such a ni@@ f@@ ty , one ste@@ p — I mean , chemi@@ sts have we@@ ird min@@ ds — one ste@@ p , 90 percent y@@ ie@@ ld , you know , and you get this lo@@ vely c@@ r@@ yst@@ al@@ line com@@ po@@ u@@ nd . Let us try it ."
"And I said , first of all , let me do the cal@@ cul@@ ation on that com@@ po@@ u@@ nd , bot@@ tom right , which is re@@ lated to cou@@ mar@@ in , but has an ex@@ tra p@@ ent@@ ag@@ on in@@ ser@@ ted into the mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le ."
"C@@ al@@ cul@@ ate the vi@@ br@@ ations , the pur@@ ple spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m is that new fel@@ low , the white one is the old one ."
And the pre@@ di@@ ction is it should s@@ me@@ ll of cou@@ mar@@ in .
They made it ... and it s@@ me@@ l@@ led exactly like cou@@ mar@@ in .
"And this is our new b@@ aby , called ton@@ k@@ ene ."
"You see , when you ’ re a scienti@@ st , you ’ re always sel@@ ling ideas ."
"And people are very resi@@ st@@ ant to ideas , and ri@@ gh@@ tly so ."
Why should new ideas be ac@@ cep@@ ted ?
"But when you put a little 1@@ 0-@@ gra@@ m vi@@ al on the table in front of per@@ f@@ um@@ ers and it s@@ me@@ l@@ ls like cou@@ mar@@ in , and it isn ’ t cou@@ mar@@ in , and you ’ ve found it in three weeks , this fo@@ c@@ uses everybody ’ s mind wonder@@ fully ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And people often ask me , is your the@@ ory ac@@ cep@@ ted ?"
"And I said , well , by wh@@ om ? I mean most , you know — there ’ s three at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des : You ’ re right , and I don ’ t know why , which is the most r@@ ational one at this point ."
"You ’ re right , and I don ’ t care how you do it , in a sense ; you bring me the mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les , you know ."
"And : You ’ re completely wrong , and I ’ m sure you ’ re completely wrong ."
"O@@ K ? Now , we ’ re de@@ al@@ ing with people who only want resul@@ ts , and this is the comm@@ er@@ cial world ."
"And they tell us that even if we do it by ast@@ ro@@ logy , they ’ re happy ."
But we ’ re not actually doing it by ast@@ ro@@ logy .
"But for the last three years , I ’ ve had what I consi@@ der to be the best job in the entire universe , which is to put my h@@ ob@@ by — which is , you know , fra@@ gran@@ ce and all the mag@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent things — p@@ lu@@ s a little bit of bi@@ op@@ h@@ ysi@@ cs , a small amount of self-@@ t@@ au@@ ght chemi@@ stry at the ser@@ vice of something that actually works ."
Thank you very much .

"H@@ er pl@@ an was to row it alone across the At@@ lan@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an — no mot@@ or , no sa@@ il — something no woman and no American had ever done before ."
"This would be her rou@@ te : over 3@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 miles across the open Nor@@ th At@@ lan@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an ."
This was not her first big expe@@ di@@ tion .

This is her 2@@ 1@@ st day at se@@ a .
"A@@ t this point , she &apos;d co@@ vered over 1@@ ,000 miles , had had no radi@@ o cont@@ act in more than two weeks fol@@ low@@ ing a stor@@ m that dis@@ ab@@ led all her lon@@ g@@ -@@ r@@ ange communi@@ c@@ ations systems just five days in ."

I &apos;m not very happy right now .

They found her ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed boat two months later ad@@ ri@@ ft ne@@ ar Fran@@ ce .

"For 1@@ 3 long years , that was my re@@ ality ."
"Mo@@ st of us never think t@@ wi@@ ce about talking , about communi@@ c@@ ating ."
I &apos;ve thought a lot about it .
I &apos;ve had a lot of time to think .
"For the first 12 years of my life , I was a nor@@ mal , happy , health@@ y little bo@@ y ."
Th@@ en everything changed .
I con@@ trac@@ ted a brain in@@ fe@@ ction .
"The do@@ ct@@ ors wer@@ en &apos;t sure what it was , but they tre@@ ated me the best they could ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , I pro@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vely got wor@@ se ."
"E@@ ven@@ tually , I lost my ability to control my mov@@ em@@ ents , make ey@@ e cont@@ act , and finally , my ability to speak ."

"I said to my mother , &quot; &quot; When home ? &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose were the last words I ever spo@@ ke with my own vo@@ ice ."
I would ev@@ en@@ tually fa@@ il every test for ment@@ al aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess .
My parents were told I was as good as not there .
"A ve@@ ge@@ table , having the inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence of a thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th@@ -@@ old b@@ aby ."
"My parents , in fact my entire family &apos;s lives , became con@@ sum@@ ed by taking care of me the best they knew how ."
Th@@ e@@ ir friends dri@@ f@@ ted away .
"One year turned to two , two turned to three ."
It seem@@ ed like the person I once was began to disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar .
The L@@ ego blo@@ cks and ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic cir@@ cu@@ its I &apos;d lo@@ ved as a bo@@ y were put away .
I had been mo@@ ved out of my be@@ dro@@ om into another more prac@@ tical one .
"I had become a gh@@ o@@ st , a f@@ ad@@ ed memor@@ y of a bo@@ y people once knew and lo@@ ved ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , my mind began k@@ ni@@ tting itself back together ."
"G@@ ra@@ du@@ ally , my aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess started to re@@ turn ."
But no one realized that I had come back to life .
"I was aw@@ are of everything , just like any nor@@ mal person ."
"I could see and understand everything , but I couldn &apos;t find a way to let any@@ body know ."
"My per@@ son@@ ality was ent@@ om@@ bed within a seem@@ ing@@ ly sil@@ ent body , a vi@@ br@@ ant mind hi@@ d@@ den in pla@@ in si@@ ght within a ch@@ ry@@ s@@ al@@ is ."
"The star@@ k re@@ ality h@@ it me that I was going to spend the rest of my life lo@@ cked inside myself , tot@@ ally alone ."
I was tra@@ pped with only my thou@@ ghts for company .
I would never be re@@ s@@ cu@@ ed .
No one would ever show me ten@@ der@@ ness .
I would never talk to a friend .
No one would ever love me .
"I had no dre@@ am@@ s , no hope , nothing to look forward to ."
"Well , nothing ple@@ as@@ ant ."
"I li@@ ved in fe@@ ar , and , to put it blu@@ n@@ tly , was wai@@ ting for death to finally rele@@ ase me , expe@@ cting to die all alone in a care home ."
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s tru@@ ly possible to ex@@ pre@@ ss in words what it &apos;s like not to be able to communi@@ cate .
"@@ Y@@ our per@@ son@@ ality ap@@ pe@@ ars to v@@ ani@@ sh into a he@@ av@@ y fo@@ g and all of your emoti@@ ons and de@@ si@@ res are con@@ stri@@ cted , sti@@ f@@ led and mu@@ ted within you ."
"For me , the wor@@ st was the feeling of ut@@ ter power@@ l@@ ess@@ ness ."
I simply ex@@ ist@@ ed .
"It &apos;s a very dar@@ k place to find yourself because in a sense , you have v@@ ani@@ shed ."
O@@ ther people contro@@ l@@ led every aspe@@ ct of my life .
They decided what I ate and when .
W@@ he@@ ther I was la@@ id on my side or stra@@ pped into my whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir .
I often spent my days posi@@ tion@@ ed in front of the T@@ V wat@@ ching Bar@@ ney r@@ er@@ un@@ s .
"I think because Bar@@ ney is so happy and j@@ ol@@ ly , and I absolu@@ tely wasn &apos;t , it made it so much wor@@ se ."
I was completely power@@ less to change anything in my life or people &apos;s per@@ cep@@ tions of me .

"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , I wasn &apos;t only an obser@@ ver ."
"Wi@@ th no way to communi@@ cate , I became the perfe@@ ct vi@@ cti@@ m : a def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess obje@@ ct , seem@@ ing@@ ly de@@ vo@@ id of feel@@ ings that people used to play out their dar@@ k@@ est de@@ si@@ res ."
"For more than 10 years , people who were char@@ g@@ ed with my care ab@@ used me physi@@ cally , ver@@ b@@ ally and se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ."
"D@@ es@@ pi@@ te what they thought , I did feel ."
"The first time it happened , I was sh@@ oc@@ ked and fil@@ led with dis@@ belie@@ f ."
How could they do this to me ?
I was con@@ f@@ used .
What had I done to des@@ er@@ ve this ?
P@@ art of me wanted to c@@ ry and another part wanted to fi@@ ght .
"H@@ ur@@ t , s@@ ad@@ ness and ang@@ er flo@@ od@@ ed through me ."
I felt wor@@ th@@ less .
There was no one to comfor@@ t me .
But ne@@ i@@ ther of my parents knew this was happening .
"I li@@ ved in ter@@ ro@@ r , know@@ ing it would happen again and again ."
I just never knew when .
All I knew was that I would never be the same .
"I remember once list@@ ening to W@@ hi@@ t@@ ney H@@ ou@@ st@@ on sing@@ ing , &quot; No matter what they take from me , they can &apos;t take away my di@@ gni@@ ty . &quot;"
"And I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; You want to be@@ t ? &quot; &quot; P@@ er@@ haps my parents could have found out and could have hel@@ ped ."
"But the years of con@@ st@@ ant car@@ e@@ taking , having to wa@@ ke up every two hours to turn me , com@@ b@@ ined with them essen@@ ti@@ ally gr@@ ie@@ ving the lo@@ ss of their son , had taken a t@@ ol@@ l on my mother and father ."
"F@@ ol@@ low@@ ing yet another he@@ ated ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent between my parents , in a moment of des@@ pa@@ ir and des@@ per@@ ation , my mother turned to me and told me that I should die ."
"I was sh@@ oc@@ ked , but as I thought about what she had said , I was fil@@ led with en@@ or@@ m@@ ous comp@@ as@@ sion and love for my mother , yet I could do nothing about it ."
"There were many mom@@ ents when I gave up , sin@@ king into a dar@@ k ab@@ y@@ ss ."
I remember one parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly low moment .
My d@@ ad left me alone in the car while he quickly went to bu@@ y something from the stor@@ e .
"A ran@@ dom str@@ ang@@ er wal@@ ked past , looked at me and he smi@@ led ."
"I may never know why , but that simple act , the f@@ le@@ e@@ ting moment of human conne@@ ction , trans@@ form@@ ed how I was feeling , making me want to keep going ."
"My ex@@ ist@@ ence was tor@@ tu@@ red by mon@@ ot@@ ony , a re@@ ality that was often too much to be@@ ar ."
"A@@ l@@ one with my thou@@ ghts , I con@@ stru@@ cted in@@ tri@@ cate fan@@ t@@ as@@ ies about an@@ ts ru@@ n@@ ning across the flo@@ or ."
I t@@ au@@ ght myself to tell the time by noti@@ cing where the sha@@ dow@@ s were .
"As I learned how the sha@@ dow@@ s mo@@ ved as the hours of the day pas@@ sed , I under@@ sto@@ od how long it would be before I was pi@@ cked up and taken home ."
Se@@ e@@ ing my father walk through the door to colle@@ ct me was the best moment of the day .
My mind became a to@@ ol that I could use to either close down to re@@ tre@@ at from my re@@ ality or en@@ large into a gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic space that I could fi@@ ll with fan@@ t@@ as@@ ies .
I hop@@ ed that my re@@ ality would change and someone would see that I had come back to life .
"But I had been wa@@ shed away like a s@@ and ca@@ st@@ le built too close to the wa@@ ves , and in my place was the person people expe@@ cted me to be ."
"To some I was Mar@@ t@@ in , a vac@@ ant sh@@ ell , the ve@@ ge@@ table , des@@ er@@ ving of har@@ sh words , dis@@ mis@@ s@@ al and even ab@@ use ."
"To others , I was the tra@@ gi@@ cally bra@@ in@@ -@@ dam@@ aged bo@@ y who had grow@@ n to become a man ."
S@@ ome@@ one they were kind to and car@@ ed for .
"G@@ o@@ od or bad , I was a bl@@ ank can@@ v@@ as on@@ to which different ver@@ sions of myself were proje@@ cted ."
It took someone new to see me in a different way .
A@@ n aro@@ ma@@ ther@@ a@@ pi@@ st began coming to the care home about once a week .
"W@@ he@@ ther through in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion or her at@@ ten@@ tion to de@@ ta@@ il@@ s that others fai@@ led to noti@@ ce , she became con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that I could understand what was being said ."
She ur@@ g@@ ed my parents to have me test@@ ed by exper@@ ts in au@@ g@@ ment@@ ative and alter@@ n@@ ative communi@@ cation .
"And within a year , I was beginning to use a computer program to communi@@ cate ."
"It was ex@@ h@@ il@@ ar@@ ating , but f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating at times ."
"I had so many words in my mind , that I couldn &apos;t wa@@ it to be able to share them ."
"S@@ ome@@ times , I would say things to myself simply because I could ."
"In myself , I had a ready audience , and I belie@@ ved that by ex@@ pres@@ sing my thou@@ ghts and wi@@ sh@@ es , others would list@@ en , too ."
"But as I began to communi@@ cate more , I realized that it was in fact only just the beginning of cre@@ ating a new vo@@ ice for myself ."
I was th@@ r@@ ust into a world I didn &apos;t quite know how to fun@@ ction in .
I stop@@ ped going to the care home and man@@ aged to get my first job making ph@@ ot@@ oc@@ op@@ ies .
"As simple as this may sound , it was amazing ."
My new world was really exci@@ ting but often quite over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming and f@@ ri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
"I was like a man@@ -@@ child , and as li@@ ber@@ ating as it often was , I stru@@ gg@@ led ."
I also learned that many of those who had known me for a long time found it im@@ possible to ab@@ an@@ don the idea of Mar@@ t@@ in they had in their he@@ ads .
W@@ hi@@ le those I had only just met stru@@ gg@@ led to look past the image of a sil@@ ent man in a whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir .
I realized that some people would only list@@ en to me if what I said was in line with what they expe@@ cted .
"O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , it was dis@@ re@@ gar@@ ded and they did what they felt was best ."
I disco@@ vered that true communi@@ cation is about more than mer@@ ely physi@@ cally con@@ ve@@ ying a mess@@ age .
It is about getting the mess@@ age heard and re@@ spe@@ cted .
"S@@ ti@@ ll , things were going well ."
My body was s@@ low@@ ly getting stron@@ ger .
"I had a job in compu@@ ting that I lo@@ ved , and had even got Ko@@ jak , the do@@ g I had been dre@@ am@@ ing about for years ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , I lon@@ g@@ ed to share my life with someone ."
"I remember star@@ ing out the win@@ do@@ w as my d@@ ad dro@@ ve me home from work , thinking I have so much love inside of me and no@@ body to give it to ."
"J@@ ust as I had re@@ sig@@ ned myself to being single for the rest of my life , I met Jo@@ an ."
"N@@ ot only is she the best thing that has ever happened to me , but Jo@@ an hel@@ ped me to challen@@ ge my own mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tions about myself ."
Jo@@ an said it was through my words that she fe@@ ll in love with me .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , after all I had been through , I still couldn &apos;t sha@@ ke the belie@@ f that no@@ body could tru@@ ly see be@@ y@@ ond my dis@@ ability and ac@@ cept me for who I am ."
I also really stru@@ gg@@ led to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end that I was a man .
"The first time someone re@@ fer@@ red to me as a man , it stop@@ ped me in my trac@@ ks ."
"I felt like looking around and as@@ king , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o , me ? &quot; &quot; That all changed with Jo@@ an ."
We have an amazing conne@@ ction and I learned how important it is to communi@@ cate open@@ ly and hon@@ est@@ ly .
"I felt sa@@ fe , and it gave me the con@@ fi@@ dence to tru@@ ly say what I thought ."
"I started to feel whole again , a man wor@@ th@@ y of love ."
I began to re@@ sha@@ pe my de@@ st@@ iny .
I spo@@ ke up a little more at work .
I as@@ ser@@ ted my need for in@@ depen@@ dence to the people around me .
Be@@ ing given a means of communi@@ cation changed everything .
I used the power of words and will to challen@@ ge the pre@@ con@@ cep@@ tions of those around me and those I had of myself .
"C@@ om@@ muni@@ cation is what makes us human , en@@ ab@@ ling us to conne@@ ct on the de@@ e@@ p@@ est level with those around us — tel@@ ling our own stories , ex@@ pres@@ sing wan@@ ts , needs and de@@ si@@ res , or hear@@ ing those of others by really list@@ ening ."
All this is how the world know@@ s who we are .
So who are we without it ?
T@@ ru@@ e communi@@ cation incre@@ ases under@@ standing and cre@@ ates a more car@@ ing and comp@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ ate world .
"O@@ n@@ ce , I was per@@ cei@@ ved to be an in@@ anim@@ ate obje@@ ct , a min@@ d@@ less ph@@ an@@ tom of a bo@@ y in a whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , I am so much more ."
"A h@@ us@@ b@@ and , a son , a friend , a bro@@ ther , a business ow@@ ner , a fir@@ st@@ -@@ clas@@ s hon@@ ors gra@@ du@@ ate , a ke@@ en am@@ ate@@ ur photograph@@ er ."
It is my ability to communi@@ cate that has given me all this .
We are told that ac@@ tions speak l@@ ou@@ der than words .
"But I won@@ der , do they ?"
"O@@ ur words , h@@ ow@@ ever we communi@@ cate them , are just as powerful ."
"W@@ he@@ ther we speak the words with our own vo@@ i@@ ces , ty@@ pe them with our eyes , or communi@@ cate them n@@ on-@@ ver@@ b@@ ally to someone who spe@@ ak@@ s them for us , words are am@@ ong our most powerful to@@ ols ."
"I have come to you through a terri@@ ble dar@@ k@@ ness , pul@@ led from it by car@@ ing s@@ ou@@ ls and by language itself ."
The act of you list@@ ening to me today br@@ ings me far@@ ther into the light .
We are sh@@ ining here together .
"If there is one most difficult ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le to my way of communi@@ c@@ ating , it is that sometimes I want to sh@@ out and other times simply to whi@@ sp@@ er a word of love or gr@@ ati@@ tu@@ de ."
It all sounds the same .
"But if you will , ple@@ ase imagine these next two words as war@@ m@@ ly as you can : Thank you ."
( Applause )
"In two weeks time , that &apos;s the n@@ in@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the day I first ste@@ pped out on@@ to that hal@@ low@@ ed &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy &quot; &quot; set ."
"I mean , n@@ ine years is a long time ."
"And given &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy &apos;s &quot; &quot; a@@ ver@@ age demo@@ gra@@ phi@@ cs , I think what that means is most of the people who saw me on that show are now de@@ ad ."
"( Laughter ) But not all , a few are still ali@@ ve ."
O@@ c@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally I still get re@@ cogni@@ zed at the mall or whatever .
"And when I do , it &apos;s as a bit of a know@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ all ."
"I think that ship has sa@@ i@@ led , it &apos;s too l@@ ate for me ."
"For better or for wor@@ se , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to be known as , as the guy who knew a lot of we@@ ird stuff ."
And I can &apos;t com@@ pla@@ in about this .
"I feel like that was always sort of my de@@ st@@ iny , al@@ though I had for many years been pretty de@@ e@@ ply in the tri@@ vi@@ a clo@@ set ."
"If nothing else , you realize very quickly as a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er , it is not a h@@ it with girls to know C@@ ap@@ tain K@@ ir@@ k &apos;s mi@@ ddle name ."
"( Laughter ) And as a resul@@ t , I was sort of the de@@ e@@ ply clo@@ se@@ ted kind of know@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ all for many years ."
"But if you go f@@ ur@@ ther back , if you look at it , it &apos;s all there ."
I was the kind of kid who was always bu@@ gg@@ ing M@@ om and D@@ ad with whatever great fact I had just read about — H@@ al@@ ey &apos;s com@@ et or gi@@ ant s@@ qui@@ ds or the size of the world &apos;s bi@@ ggest pu@@ m@@ p@@ k@@ in p@@ ie or whatever it was .
I now have a 1@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old of my own who &apos;s exactly the same .
"And I know how de@@ e@@ ply an@@ no@@ ying it is , so kar@@ ma does work ."
"( Laughter ) And I lo@@ ved g@@ ame shows , fas@@ cin@@ ated with g@@ ame shows ."
"I remember c@@ ry@@ ing on my first day of kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten back in 19@@ 7@@ 9 because it had just h@@ it me , as bad@@ ly as I wanted to go to school , that I was also going to mi@@ ss &quot; &quot; H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood S@@ qu@@ ar@@ es &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; F@@ ami@@ ly F@@ e@@ u@@ d . &quot; &quot; I was going to mi@@ ss my g@@ ame shows ."
"And later , in the mi@@ d@@ - &apos; 8@@ 0s , when &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy &quot; &quot; came back on the air , I remember ru@@ n@@ ning home from school every day to wat@@ ch the show ."
"It was my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te show , even before it pa@@ id for my house ."
"And we li@@ ved over@@ se@@ as , we li@@ ved in S@@ outh Kore@@ a where my d@@ ad was working , where there was only one En@@ g@@ li@@ sh language T@@ V ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l ."
"There was Ar@@ med F@@ or@@ ces T@@ V , and if you didn &apos;t speak Kore@@ an , that &apos;s what you were wat@@ ching ."
So me and all my friends would run home every day and wat@@ ch &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy . &quot; &quot; I was always that kind of ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed tri@@ vi@@ a kid .
"I remember being able to play T@@ ri@@ vi@@ al P@@ ur@@ su@@ it against my parents back in the &apos; 8@@ 0s and hol@@ ding my own , back when that was a f@@ ad ."
There &apos;s a we@@ ird sense of ma@@ st@@ ery you get when you know some bit of bo@@ om@@ er tri@@ vi@@ a that M@@ om and D@@ ad don &apos;t know .
You know some Be@@ at@@ les fac@@ to@@ id that D@@ ad didn &apos;t know .
"And you think , ah ha@@ h , know@@ le@@ dge really is power — the right fact de@@ plo@@ yed at exactly the right place ."
"I never had a gu@@ i@@ dance coun@@ se@@ lor who thought this was a le@@ gi@@ ti@@ m@@ ate car@@ e@@ er pat@@ h , that thought you could major in tri@@ vi@@ a or be a prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal ex@@ -@@ g@@ ame show con@@ test@@ ant ."
And so I s@@ old out way too young .
I didn &apos;t try to figure out what one does with that .
"I stud@@ ied compu@@ ters because I heard that was the thing , and I became a computer progra@@ m@@ m@@ er — not an es@@ pe@@ cially good one , not an es@@ pe@@ cially happy one at the time when I was first on &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy &quot; &quot; in 200@@ 4 ."
But that &apos;s what I was doing .
"And it made it d@@ ou@@ bly i@@ ro@@ nic — my computer back@@ ground — a few years later , I think 200@@ 9 or so , when I got another phone call from &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy &quot; &quot; saying , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s early days yet , but I@@ B@@ M tel@@ ls us they want to build a super@@ computer to be@@ at you at &apos; Je@@ opar@@ dy . &apos; A@@ re you up for this ? &quot; &quot; This was the first I &apos;d heard of it ."
"And of course I said y@@ es , for se@@ ver@@ al reas@@ ons ."
"One , because playing &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy &quot; &quot; is a great time ."
It &apos;s fun . It &apos;s the most fun you can have with your pan@@ ts on .
( Laughter ) And I would do it for nothing .
"I don &apos;t think they know that , lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly , but I would go back and play for Ar@@ by &apos;s cou@@ po@@ ns ."
"I just love &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy , &quot; &quot; and I always have ."
"And second of all , because I &apos;m a ner@@ dy guy and this seem@@ ed like the future ."
"P@@ e@@ ople playing compu@@ ters on g@@ ame shows was the kind of thing I always imag@@ ined would happen in the future , and now I could be on the st@@ age with it ."
I was not going to say no .
The third reason I said y@@ es is because I was pretty con@@ fi@@ dent that I was going to wi@@ n .
I had taken some arti@@ fi@@ cial inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence clas@@ ses .
"I knew there were no compu@@ ters that could do what you need to do to wi@@ n on &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ ople don &apos;t realize how t@@ ough it is to write that kind of program that can read a &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy &quot; &quot; clu@@ e in a natural language like En@@ g@@ li@@ sh and understand all the d@@ ou@@ ble me@@ an@@ ings , the pun@@ s , the red her@@ r@@ ings , un@@ p@@ ack the me@@ an@@ ing of the clu@@ e ."
"The kind of thing that a thre@@ e@@ - or f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old human , little kid could do , very hard for a computer ."
"And I thought , well this is going to be child &apos;s play ."
"@@ Yes , I will come de@@ stro@@ y the computer and def@@ end my species ."
"( Laughter ) But as the years went on , as I@@ B@@ M started th@@ row@@ ing money and man@@ power and pro@@ cess@@ or speed at this , I started to get oc@@ ca@@ si@@ onal up@@ d@@ ates from them , and I started to get a little more wor@@ ried ."
I remember a jour@@ na@@ l arti@@ cle about this new question ans@@ wer@@ ing so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that had a gra@@ ph .
"It was a sc@@ at@@ ter char@@ t show@@ ing perform@@ ance on &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy , &quot; &quot; ten@@ s of thousands of d@@ ots re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy &quot; &quot; ch@@ am@@ pi@@ ons up at the top with their perform@@ ance pl@@ ot@@ ted on number of — I was going to say questions ans@@ wer@@ ed , but ans@@ w@@ ers questi@@ on@@ ed , I gu@@ ess , clu@@ es respon@@ ded to — ver@@ su@@ s the ac@@ cu@@ rac@@ y of those ans@@ w@@ ers ."
So there &apos;s a certain perform@@ ance level that the computer would need to get to .
"And at first , it was very low ."
There was no so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that could compe@@ te at this kind of ar@@ en@@ a .
But then you see the line start to go up .
And it &apos;s getting very close to what they call the win@@ ner &apos;s cl@@ ou@@ d .
"And I noti@@ ced in the u@@ pp@@ er right of the sc@@ at@@ ter char@@ t some dar@@ k@@ er d@@ ots , some black d@@ ots , that were a different color ."
"And thought , what are these ?"
&quot; The black d@@ ots in the u@@ pp@@ er right re@@ present 7@@ 4@@ -@@ time &apos; Je@@ opar@@ dy &apos; ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on K@@ en J@@ en@@ n@@ ings . &quot;
And I saw this line coming for me .
"And I realized , this is it ."
This is what it looks like when the future comes for you .
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s not the T@@ er@@ min@@ ator &apos;s gu@@ n si@@ ght ; it &apos;s a little line coming clo@@ s@@ er and clo@@ s@@ er to the thing you can do , the only thing that makes you spe@@ cial , the thing you &apos;re best at ."
"And when the g@@ ame ev@@ en@@ tually happened about a year later , it was very different than the &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy &quot; &quot; g@@ am@@ es I &apos;d been used to ."
We were not playing in L@@ .@@ A@@ . on the regu@@ lar &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy &quot; &quot; set .
W@@ at@@ son does not tra@@ vel .
W@@ at@@ son &apos;s actually huge .
"It &apos;s thousands of pro@@ ces@@ sor@@ s , a ter@@ ab@@ y@@ te of memor@@ y , tri@@ llions of by@@ tes of memor@@ y ."
We got to walk through his cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ contro@@ l@@ led ser@@ ver room .
The only other &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy &quot; &quot; con@@ test@@ ant to this day I &apos;ve ever been inside .
And so W@@ at@@ son does not tra@@ vel .
You must come to it ; you must make the pi@@ l@@ g@@ ri@@ m@@ age .
So me and the other human pla@@ y@@ er w@@ ound up at this se@@ cre@@ t I@@ B@@ M research la@@ b in the mi@@ ddle of these s@@ nowy wo@@ ods in W@@ est@@ ch@@ est@@ er C@@ oun@@ ty to play the computer .
And we realized right away that the computer had a big home cour@@ t adv@@ an@@ t@@ age .
There was a big W@@ at@@ son lo@@ go in the mi@@ ddle of the st@@ age .
"L@@ i@@ ke you &apos;re going to play the Chi@@ ca@@ go Bu@@ l@@ ls , and there &apos;s the thing in the mi@@ ddle of their cour@@ t ."
"And the c@@ row@@ d was full of I@@ B@@ M V@@ .@@ P@@ .@@ s and progra@@ m@@ m@@ ers che@@ ering on their little dar@@ ling , having po@@ u@@ red mi@@ llions of dollars into this hop@@ ing against hope that the hum@@ ans scre@@ w up , and hol@@ ding up &quot; &quot; G@@ o W@@ at@@ son &quot; &quot; sig@@ ns and just ap@@ pl@@ au@@ ding like p@@ ag@@ e@@ ant mom@@ s every time their little dar@@ ling got one right ."
I think guys had &quot; &quot; W@@ -@@ A@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ S@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ N &quot; &quot; wri@@ t@@ ten on their be@@ ll@@ ies in gre@@ ase pa@@ int .
"If you can imagine computer progra@@ m@@ m@@ ers with the let@@ ters &quot; &quot; W@@ -@@ A@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ S@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ N &quot; &quot; wri@@ t@@ ten on their gu@@ t , it &apos;s an un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant si@@ ght ."
But they were right . They were exactly right .
"I don &apos;t want to spo@@ il it , if you still have this sitting on your D@@ V@@ R , but W@@ at@@ son won h@@ an@@ di@@ ly ."
And I remember standing there behind the po@@ di@@ um as I could hear that little in@@ se@@ c@@ to@@ id th@@ um@@ b c@@ lic@@ king .
It had a robot th@@ um@@ b that was c@@ lic@@ king on the bu@@ z@@ z@@ er .
"And you could hear that little ti@@ ck , ti@@ ck , ti@@ ck , ti@@ ck ."
"And I remember thinking , this is it ."
I felt ob@@ so@@ le@@ te .
I felt like a De@@ tro@@ it fac@@ t@@ ory wor@@ k@@ er of the &apos; 8@@ 0s seeing a robot that could now do his job on the as@@ se@@ m@@ bly line .
I felt like qui@@ z show con@@ test@@ ant was now the first job that had become ob@@ so@@ le@@ te under this new regi@@ me of thinking compu@@ ters .
And it ha@@ sn &apos;t been the last .
"If you wat@@ ch the news , you &apos;ll see oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally — and I see this all the time — that ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ ist@@ s now , there &apos;s a mach@@ ine that can fi@@ ll pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tions au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally without actually ne@@ e@@ ding a human ph@@ ar@@ m@@ aci@@ st ."
And a lot of la@@ w fir@@ ms are getting ri@@ d of par@@ ale@@ g@@ als because there &apos;s so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that can su@@ m up case l@@ aw@@ s and leg@@ al br@@ ie@@ f@@ s and deci@@ sions .
You don &apos;t need human as@@ si@@ stan@@ ts for that any@@ more .
I read the other day about a program where you fe@@ ed it a box sc@@ ore from a bas@@ e@@ ball or fo@@ ot@@ ball g@@ ame and it sp@@ its out a news arti@@ cle as if a human had wat@@ ched the g@@ ame and was com@@ ment@@ ing on it .
"And obvi@@ ously these new technolog@@ ies can &apos;t do as cle@@ ver or cre@@ ative a job as the hum@@ ans they &apos;re re@@ plac@@ ing , but they &apos;re f@@ ast@@ er , and c@@ ru@@ cially , they &apos;re much , much che@@ ap@@ er ."
So it makes me won@@ der what the economic effe@@ cts of this might be .
"I &apos;ve read econom@@ ist@@ s saying that , as a resul@@ t of these new technolog@@ ies , we &apos;ll enter a new g@@ ol@@ den age of le@@ i@@ sure when we &apos;ll all have time for the things we really love because all these on@@ er@@ ous t@@ as@@ ks will be taken over by W@@ at@@ son and his di@@ gi@@ tal bre@@ thre@@ n ."
"I &apos;ve heard other people say quite the op@@ posi@@ te , that this is yet another t@@ ier of the mi@@ ddle clas@@ s that &apos;s having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology and that this is actually something om@@ in@@ ous , something that we should wor@@ ry about ."
I &apos;m not an econ@@ omi@@ st myself .
All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work .
And it was f@@ ri@@ gg@@ in &apos; de@@ mor@@ aliz@@ ing . It was terri@@ ble .
"H@@ ere &apos;s the one thing that I was ever good at , and all it took was I@@ B@@ M po@@ ur@@ ing ten@@ s of mi@@ llions of dollars and its s@@ mar@@ test people and thousands of pro@@ ces@@ sor@@ s working in par@@ al@@ le@@ l and they could do the same thing ."
"They could do it a little bit f@@ ast@@ er and a little better on national T@@ V , and &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , K@@ en . We don &apos;t need you any@@ more . &quot; &quot; And it made me think , what does this mean , if we &apos;re going to be able to start out@@ sour@@ cing , not just low@@ er uni@@ m@@ port@@ ant brain fun@@ ctions ."
"I &apos;m sure many of you remember a di@@ st@@ ant time when we had to know phone num@@ bers , when we knew our friends &apos; phone num@@ bers ."
"And sud@@ den@@ ly there was a mach@@ ine that did that , and now we don &apos;t need to remember that any@@ more ."
"I have read that there &apos;s now actually evi@@ dence that the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ pu@@ s , the part of our brain that hand@@ les sp@@ aci@@ al relation@@ ships , physi@@ cally sh@@ r@@ in@@ ks and at@@ ro@@ ph@@ ies in people who use to@@ ols like G@@ P@@ S , because we &apos;re not ex@@ er@@ ci@@ sing our sense of dire@@ ction any@@ more ."
We &apos;re just obe@@ ying a little talking vo@@ ice on our d@@ ash@@ bo@@ ard .
"And as a resul@@ t , a part of our brain that &apos;s sup@@ posed to do that kind of stuff gets s@@ mal@@ ler and du@@ m@@ ber ."
"And it made me think , what happens when compu@@ ters are now better at know@@ ing and re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing stuff than we are ?"
Is all of our brain going to start to sh@@ r@@ in@@ k and at@@ ro@@ ph@@ y like that ?
A@@ re we as a culture going to start to val@@ ue know@@ le@@ dge less ?
"As somebody who has always belie@@ ved in the import@@ ance of the stuff that we know , this was a terri@@ f@@ ying idea to me ."
"The more I thought about it , I realized , no , it &apos;s still important ."
The things we know are still important .
"I came to believe there were two adv@@ an@@ t@@ ages that those of us who have these things in our head have over somebody who says , &quot; &quot; Oh , ye@@ ah . I can Go@@ og@@ le that . H@@ old on a second . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s an adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of v@@ olu@@ me , and there &apos;s an adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of time ."
"The adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of v@@ olu@@ me , first , just has to do with the comple@@ x@@ ity of the world now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys ."
There &apos;s so much information out there .
"Be@@ ing a R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance man or woman , that &apos;s something that was only possible in the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance ."
Now it &apos;s really not possible to be reas@@ on@@ ably edu@@ c@@ ated on every fie@@ ld of human en@@ de@@ av@@ or .
There &apos;s just too much .
"They say that the sc@@ op@@ e of human information is now d@@ ou@@ b@@ ling every 18 months or so , the su@@ m tot@@ al of human information ."
"That means between now and l@@ ate 20@@ 14 , we will gener@@ ate as much information , in terms of gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , as all of hum@@ ani@@ ty has in all the pre@@ vi@@ ous mi@@ ll@@ enia put together ."
It &apos;s d@@ ou@@ b@@ ling every 18 months now .
This is terri@@ f@@ ying because a lot of the big deci@@ sions we make requi@@ re the ma@@ st@@ ery of lots of different kinds of fac@@ ts .
A deci@@ sion like where do I go to school ? What should I major in ?
Wh@@ o do I v@@ ot@@ e for ?
Do I take this job or that one ?
These are the deci@@ sions that requi@@ re cor@@ re@@ ct ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments about many different kinds of fac@@ ts .
"If we have those fac@@ ts at our ment@@ al fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps , we &apos;re going to be able to make inform@@ ed deci@@ sions ."
"If , on the other hand , we need to look them all up , we may be in t@@ rou@@ ble ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to a N@@ ational G@@ e@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c sur@@ v@@ ey I just saw , some@@ where along the lin@@ es of 80 percent of the people who v@@ ot@@ e in a U.@@ S. pre@@ si@@ den@@ tial ele@@ ction about issu@@ es like fore@@ ig@@ n poli@@ cy cannot find I@@ ra@@ q or Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan on a ma@@ p ."
"If you can &apos;t do that first ste@@ p , are you really going to look up the other thous@@ and fac@@ ts you &apos;re going to need to know to ma@@ ster your know@@ le@@ dge of U.@@ S. fore@@ ig@@ n poli@@ cy ?"
Q@@ u@@ i@@ te probably not .
"A@@ t some point you &apos;re just going to be like , &quot; You know what ? There &apos;s too much to know . S@@ cre@@ w it . &quot;"
And you &apos;ll make a less inform@@ ed deci@@ sion .
The other issue is the adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of time that you have if you have all these things at your fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps .
I always think of the story of a little girl na@@ med T@@ il@@ ly S@@ mi@@ th .
"S@@ he was a 1@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old girl from S@@ ur@@ re@@ y , En@@ gl@@ and on vac@@ ation with her parents a few years ago in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et , T@@ ha@@ il@@ and ."
"S@@ he ru@@ ns up to them on the be@@ ach one morning and says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , D@@ ad , we &apos;ve got to get off the be@@ ach . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? We just got here . &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; In M@@ r. K@@ ear@@ ney &apos;s ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y clas@@ s last mon@@ th , he told us that when the ti@@ de goes out ab@@ ru@@ p@@ tly out to se@@ a and you see the wa@@ ves ch@@ ur@@ ning way out there , that &apos;s the sig@@ n of a t@@ su@@ nami , and you need to clear the be@@ ach . &quot; &quot; What would you do if your 1@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old d@@ aughter came up to you with this ?"
"H@@ er parents thought about it , and they finally , to their cre@@ d@@ it , decided to believe her ."
"They told the li@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard , they went back to the hot@@ el , and the li@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard c@@ lear@@ ed over 100 people off the be@@ ach , lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly , because that was the day of the Bo@@ x@@ ing D@@ ay t@@ su@@ nami , the day after Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , 200@@ 4 , that kil@@ led thousands of people in S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a and around the Indi@@ an O@@ ce@@ an ."
"But not on that be@@ ach , not on Ma@@ i K@@ ha@@ o Be@@ ach , because this little girl had re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed one fact from her ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y teach@@ er a mon@@ th before ."
"Now when fac@@ ts come in h@@ an@@ dy like that — I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact , one re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed fact in exactly the right place at the right time — nor@@ m@@ ally something that &apos;s e@@ as@@ ier to see on g@@ ame shows than in real life ."
But in this case it happened in real life .
And it happens in real life all the time .
"It &apos;s not always a t@@ su@@ nami , often it &apos;s a social situ@@ ation ."
It &apos;s a me@@ e@@ ting or job inter@@ view or first d@@ ate or some relation@@ ship that gets lu@@ bri@@ c@@ ated because two people realize they share some common piece of know@@ le@@ dge .
"You say where you &apos;re from , and I say , &quot; &quot; Oh , ye@@ ah . &quot; &quot; O@@ r your al@@ ma mat@@ er or your job , and I know just a little something about it , enough to get the ball rol@@ ling ."
Pe@@ ople love that sh@@ ared conne@@ ction that gets created when somebody know@@ s something about you .
It &apos;s like they took the time to get to know you before you even met .
That &apos;s often the adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of time .
"And it &apos;s not effe@@ ctive if you say , &quot; &quot; Well , h@@ old on ."
"You &apos;re from F@@ ar@@ go , Nor@@ th D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a . Let me see what comes up ."
"O@@ h , ye@@ ah . R@@ og@@ er Mar@@ is was from F@@ ar@@ go . &quot; &quot; That doesn &apos;t work . That &apos;s just an@@ no@@ ying ."
"( Laughter ) The great 1@@ 8@@ th@@ -@@ century Bri@@ ti@@ sh the@@ ologi@@ an and thin@@ k@@ er , friend of D@@ r. Joh@@ n@@ son , S@@ am@@ u@@ el Par@@ r once said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s always better to know a thing than not to know it . &quot; &quot; And if I have li@@ ved my life by any kind of cre@@ ed , it &apos;s probably that ."
"I have always belie@@ ved that the things we know — that know@@ le@@ dge is an absolu@@ te good , that the things we have learned and car@@ ry with us in our he@@ ads are what make us who we are , as individu@@ als and as a species ."
I don &apos;t know if I want to live in a world where know@@ le@@ dge is ob@@ so@@ le@@ te .
"I don &apos;t want to live in a world where cul@@ tu@@ ral liter@@ acy has been re@@ plac@@ ed by these little bu@@ b@@ b@@ les of speci@@ al@@ ty , so that n@@ one of us know about the common as@@ so@@ ci@@ ations that used to b@@ ind our ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation together ."
"I don &apos;t want to be the last tri@@ vi@@ a know@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ all sitting on a m@@ oun@@ tain some@@ where , re@@ ci@@ ting to hi@@ m@@ self the state ca@@ pi@@ tal@@ s and the na@@ mes of &quot; &quot; S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ ons &quot; &quot; epi@@ so@@ des and the ly@@ ri@@ cs of A@@ b@@ ba son@@ gs ."
"I feel like our ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation works when this is a v@@ ast cul@@ tu@@ ral h@@ eri@@ t@@ age that we all share and that we know without having to out@@ source it to our de@@ vi@@ ces , to our sear@@ ch en@@ gin@@ es and our s@@ mart@@ ph@@ ones ."
"In the mov@@ ies , when compu@@ ters like W@@ at@@ son start to think , things don &apos;t always end well ."
Th@@ ose mov@@ ies are never about beautiful ut@@ op@@ i@@ as .
It &apos;s always a ter@@ min@@ ator or a mat@@ ri@@ x or an ast@@ ro@@ nau@@ t getting suc@@ ked out an air@@ lo@@ ck in &quot; &quot; 200@@ 1 . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ings always go terri@@ bly wrong .
And I feel like we &apos;re sort of at the point now where we need to make that cho@@ ice of what kind of future we want to be living in .
"This is a question of le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship , because it be@@ comes a question of who le@@ ads the future ."
"O@@ n the one hand , we can cho@@ ose between a new g@@ ol@@ den age where information is more uni@@ vers@@ ally available than it &apos;s ever been in human history , where we all have the ans@@ w@@ ers to our questions at our fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps ."
"And on the other hand , we have the poten@@ tial to be living in some g@@ lo@@ om@@ y d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia where the mach@@ ines have taken over and we &apos;ve all decided it &apos;s not important what we know any@@ more , that know@@ le@@ dge isn &apos;t val@@ u@@ able because it &apos;s all out there in the cl@@ ou@@ d , and why would we ever bo@@ ther lear@@ ning anything new ."
Th@@ ose are the two cho@@ i@@ ces we have . I know which future I would rather be living in .
And we can all make that cho@@ ice .
"We make that cho@@ ice by being cu@@ ri@@ ous , in@@ qui@@ si@@ tive people who like to learn , who don &apos;t just say , &quot; &quot; Well , as so@@ on as the be@@ ll has ru@@ n@@ g and the clas@@ s is over , I don &apos;t have to learn any@@ more , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Thank go@@ od@@ ness I have my di@@ pl@@ om@@ a . I &apos;m done lear@@ ning for a li@@ fe@@ time ."
"I don &apos;t have to learn new things any@@ more . &quot; &quot; No , every day we should be stri@@ ving to learn something new ."
We should have this un@@ qu@@ en@@ ch@@ able cu@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty for the world around us .
That &apos;s where the people you see on &quot; &quot; Je@@ opar@@ dy &quot; &quot; come from .
"These know@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ al@@ ls , they &apos;re not R@@ a@@ in@@ man@@ -@@ sty@@ le sa@@ v@@ an@@ ts sitting at home memor@@ i@@ z@@ ing the phone book ."
I &apos;ve met a lot of them .
"For the most part , they are just nor@@ mal fol@@ ks who are uni@@ vers@@ ally interested in the world around them , cu@@ ri@@ ous about everything , th@@ ir@@ sty for this know@@ le@@ dge about whatever sub@@ je@@ ct ."
We can live in one of these two wor@@ l@@ ds .
"We can live in a world where our bra@@ ins , the things that we know , contin@@ ue to be the thing that makes us spe@@ cial , or a world in which we &apos;ve out@@ sour@@ ced all of that to evi@@ l super@@ compu@@ ters from the future like W@@ at@@ son ."

"( Music ) ( G@@ row@@ ling ) ( R@@ u@@ st@@ ling ) So what you &apos;ll see up there is that it &apos;s really like the atmo@@ sp@@ here of an open fie@@ ld , and there are tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous num@@ bers of plan@@ ts and animals that have ad@@ ap@@ ted to make their way and their life in the can@@ op@@ y ."
"C@@ om@@ m@@ on grou@@ ps , like the s@@ lot@@ h here , have clear ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ations for fore@@ st can@@ op@@ ies , h@@ ang@@ ing on with their very stron@@ g cl@@ aw@@ s ."
But I &apos;d like to descri@@ be to you a more sub@@ tle kind of di@@ versity and tell you about the an@@ ts .
"There are 1@@ 0,000 species of an@@ ts that ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ ist@@ s — people who descri@@ be and name animals — have na@@ med ."
"@@ 4@@ ,000 of those an@@ ts live ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely in the fore@@ st can@@ op@@ y ."
"One of the reas@@ ons I tell you about an@@ ts is because of my h@@ us@@ b@@ and , who is in fact an ant ta@@ x@@ on@@ omi@@ st and when we got mar@@ ried , he pro@@ mis@@ ed to name an ant after me , which he did — Pro@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ to@@ cer@@ us n@@ al@@ in@@ i , a can@@ op@@ y ant ."
"We &apos;ve had two children , Au@@ g@@ ust An@@ dre@@ w and E@@ ri@@ ka and actually , he na@@ med an@@ ts after them ."
So we may be the only family that has an ant na@@ med after each one of us .
"But my pas@@ sion — in ad@@ di@@ tion to J@@ ack and my children — are the plan@@ ts , the so@@ -@@ called epi@@ ph@@ y@@ tes , those plan@@ ts that gro@@ w up on tre@@ es ."
They don &apos;t have ro@@ ots that go into tru@@ n@@ ks no@@ r to the fore@@ st flo@@ or .
"But rather , it is their lea@@ ves that are ad@@ ap@@ ted to inter@@ cept the dis@@ sol@@ ved nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ ts that come to them in the form of mi@@ st and fo@@ g ."
"These plan@@ ts oc@@ cu@@ r in great di@@ versity , over 2@@ 8@@ ,000 species around the world ."
"They gro@@ w in tro@@ pi@@ cal fore@@ sts like this one and they also gro@@ w in temper@@ ate ra@@ in@@ fore@@ sts , that we find in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton state ."
These epi@@ ph@@ y@@ tes are ma@@ in@@ ly dom@@ in@@ ated by the mo@@ s@@ ses .
"One thing I want to point out is that under@@ ne@@ ath these live epi@@ ph@@ y@@ tes , as they die and de@@ com@@ pos@@ e , they actually con@@ stru@@ ct an ar@@ bo@@ real so@@ il , both in the temper@@ ate z@@ one and in the tro@@ pi@@ cs ."
"And these mo@@ s@@ ses , gener@@ ated by de@@ com@@ pos@@ ing , are like pe@@ at mo@@ ss in your gar@@ den ."
They have a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous ca@@ pac@@ ity for hol@@ ding on to nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ ts and water .
"One of the sur@@ pri@@ sing things I disco@@ vered is that , if you pu@@ ll back with me on those mat@@ s of epi@@ ph@@ y@@ tes , what you &apos;ll find under@@ ne@@ ath them are conne@@ ctions , net@@ works of what we call can@@ op@@ y ro@@ ots ."
These are not epi@@ ph@@ y@@ te ro@@ ots : these are ro@@ ots that em@@ er@@ ge from the tru@@ n@@ k and bran@@ ch of the ho@@ st tre@@ es themselves .
And so those epi@@ ph@@ y@@ tes are actually pa@@ ying the land@@ l@@ or@@ d a bit of r@@ ent in ex@@ change for being sup@@ por@@ ted high ab@@ o@@ ve the fore@@ st flo@@ or .
"I was interested , and my can@@ op@@ y resear@@ ch@@ er colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es have been interested in the dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs of the can@@ op@@ y plan@@ ts that live in the fore@@ st ."
We &apos;ve done stri@@ pping experim@@ ents where we &apos;ve re@@ mo@@ ved mat@@ s of epi@@ ph@@ y@@ tes and looked at the r@@ ates of re@@ col@@ oni@@ z@@ ation .
We had pre@@ di@@ cted that they would gro@@ w back very quickly and that they would come in en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ing from the side .
"What we found , h@@ ow@@ ever , was that they took an extre@@ me@@ ly long time — over 20 years — to re@@ gener@@ ate , star@@ ting from the bot@@ tom and grow@@ ing up ."
"And even now , after 25 years , they &apos;re not up there , they have not re@@ col@@ oni@@ zed completely ."
And I use this little image to say this is what happens to mo@@ s@@ ses .
"If it &apos;s gone , it &apos;s gone , and if you &apos;re really lu@@ ck@@ y you might get something grow@@ ing back from the bot@@ tom ."
"( Laughter ) So , re@@ col@@ oni@@ z@@ ation is really very s@@ low ."
These can@@ op@@ y communi@@ ties are fra@@ gi@@ le .
"Well , when we look out , you and I , over that can@@ op@@ y of the in@@ t@@ act pri@@ mar@@ y fore@@ st , what we see is this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous car@@ pe@@ t of car@@ b@@ on ."
One of the challen@@ ges that can@@ op@@ y resear@@ ch@@ ers are att@@ ac@@ king today is trying to understand the amount of car@@ b@@ on that is being sequ@@ est@@ er@@ ed .
"We know it &apos;s a lot , but we do not yet know the ans@@ w@@ ers to how much , and by what pro@@ cess@@ es , car@@ b@@ on is being taken out of the atmo@@ sp@@ here , he@@ ld in its bi@@ om@@ as@@ s , and moving on through the e@@ co@@ system ."
"So I hope I &apos;ve show@@ ed you that can@@ op@@ y@@ -@@ dw@@ el@@ l@@ ers are not just in@@ sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant bi@@ ts of green up high in the can@@ op@@ y that T@@ arz@@ an and J@@ ane were interested in , but rather that they f@@ ost@@ er bi@@ od@@ i@@ versity con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to e@@ co@@ system nu@@ tr@@ ien@@ t cy@@ cles , and they also help to keep our global clim@@ ate st@@ able ."
"U@@ p in the can@@ op@@ y , if you were sitting next to me and you turned around from those pri@@ mar@@ y fore@@ st e@@ co@@ systems , you would also see scen@@ es like this ."
"S@@ cen@@ es of fore@@ st de@@ stru@@ ction , fore@@ st har@@ v@@ est@@ ing and fore@@ st fra@@ g@@ ment@@ ation , ther@@ e@@ by making that in@@ t@@ act ta@@ pe@@ stry of the can@@ op@@ y u@@ na@@ ble to fun@@ ction in the mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous ways that it has when it is not di@@ st@@ urb@@ ed by hum@@ ans ."
I &apos;ve also looked out on urb@@ an places like this and thought about people who are dis@@ as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated from tre@@ es in their lives .
"P@@ e@@ ople who gre@@ w up in a place like this did not have the opportunity to clim@@ b tre@@ es and form a relation@@ ship with tre@@ es and fore@@ sts , as I did when I was a young girl ."
This t@@ rou@@ b@@ les me .
"H@@ ere in 200@@ 9 , you know , it &apos;s not an e@@ asy thing to be a fore@@ st e@@ co@@ logi@@ st , g@@ ri@@ pping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer them ."
"And es@@ pe@@ cially , you know , as a small b@@ row@@ n woman in a little colle@@ ge , in the u@@ pp@@ er nor@@ th@@ w@@ est part of our country , far away from the are@@ as of power and money , I really have to ask myself , &quot; &quot; What can I do about this ?"
"H@@ ow can I re@@ conne@@ ct people with tre@@ es ? &quot; &quot; Well , I think that I can do something ."
"I know that as a scienti@@ st , I have information and as a human being , I can communi@@ cate with any@@ body , inside or outside of ac@@ a@@ demi@@ a ."
"And so , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve beg@@ in doing , and so I &apos;d like to un@@ ve@@ il the Inter@@ national C@@ an@@ op@@ y N@@ et@@ work here ."
We con@@ sul@@ t to the media about can@@ op@@ y questions ; we have a can@@ op@@ y ne@@ w@@ s@@ let@@ ter ; we have an e@@ ma@@ il L@@ I@@ S@@ T@@ S@@ E@@ R@@ V .
"And so we &apos;re trying to dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate information about the import@@ ance of the can@@ op@@ y , the beau@@ ty of the can@@ op@@ y , the ne@@ ces@@ sity of in@@ t@@ act can@@ op@@ ies , to people outside of ac@@ a@@ demi@@ a ."
"We also re@@ cogni@@ ze that a lot of the produ@@ cts that we make — those vi@@ de@@ os and so for@@ th — you know , they don &apos;t re@@ ach everybody , and so we &apos;ve been f@@ ost@@ ering proje@@ cts that re@@ ach people outside of ac@@ a@@ demi@@ a , and outside of the cho@@ ir that most e@@ co@@ logi@@ sts pre@@ ach to ."
T@@ re@@ e@@ top Bar@@ bie is a great example of that .
"What we do , my students in my la@@ b and I , is we bu@@ y Bar@@ b@@ ies from Go@@ od@@ will and V@@ al@@ ue V@@ il@@ l@@ age , we dre@@ ss her in clo@@ the@@ s that have been made by se@@ am@@ stre@@ s@@ ses and we sen@@ d her out with a can@@ op@@ y hand@@ book ."
And my feeling is — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
— that we &apos;ve taken this po@@ p i@@ c@@ on and we have just t@@ we@@ ak@@ ed her a little bit to become an am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ or who can car@@ ry the mess@@ age that being a woman scienti@@ st stu@@ dy@@ ing tre@@ et@@ op@@ s is actually a really great thing .
"We &apos;ve also made part@@ ner@@ ships with arti@@ sts , with people who understand and can communi@@ cate the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic beau@@ ty of tre@@ es and fore@@ st can@@ op@@ ies ."
"And I &apos;d like to just tell you one of our proje@@ cts , which is the gener@@ ation of C@@ an@@ op@@ y Con@@ flu@@ ences ."
"What I do is I bring together scienti@@ sts and arti@@ sts of all kinds , and we spend a week in the fore@@ st on these little pl@@ at@@ form@@ s ; and we look at nature , we look at tre@@ es , we look at the can@@ op@@ y , and we communi@@ cate , and ex@@ change , and ex@@ pre@@ ss what we see together ."
The resul@@ ts have been fanta@@ stic .
I &apos;ll just give you a few exam@@ ples .
This is a fanta@@ stic in@@ stal@@ l@@ ation by B@@ ru@@ ce C@@ ha@@ o who is cha@@ ir of the S@@ cul@@ p@@ ture and G@@ las@@ s B@@ low@@ ing De@@ part@@ ment at R@@ h@@ od@@ e Is@@ land S@@ cho@@ ol of De@@ sig@@ n .
"He saw ne@@ sts in the can@@ op@@ y at one of our C@@ an@@ op@@ y Con@@ flu@@ ences in the P@@ aci@@ fic Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est , and created this beautiful s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ."
We &apos;ve had dance people up in the can@@ op@@ y .
"J@@ od@@ i L@@ om@@ ask , and her wonderful t@@ rou@@ pe C@@ ap@@ ac@@ it@@ or , jo@@ ined me in the can@@ op@@ y in my ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st site in C@@ ost@@ a Ri@@ ca ."
"They made a f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous dance called &quot; &quot; Bi@@ ome . &quot; &quot; They dan@@ ced in the fore@@ st , and we are taking this dance , my scienti@@ fic ou@@ tre@@ ach communi@@ c@@ ations , and also lin@@ king up with environ@@ ment@@ al grou@@ ps , to go to different cities and to per@@ form the science , the dance and the environ@@ ment@@ al ou@@ tre@@ ach that we hope will make a difference ."
"We brought musi@@ ci@@ ans to the can@@ op@@ y , and they made their music — and it &apos;s fanta@@ stic music ."
"We had wo@@ o@@ den flu@@ ti@@ sts , we had ob@@ o@@ ist@@ s , we had op@@ era sing@@ ers , we had gu@@ it@@ ar pla@@ y@@ ers , and we had ra@@ p sing@@ ers ."
And I brought a little se@@ g@@ ment to give you of D@@ u@@ ke Bra@@ dy &apos;s &quot; &quot; C@@ an@@ op@@ y R@@ a@@ p . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) That &apos;s D@@ u@@ ke !
( Applause ) This experience of working with D@@ u@@ ke also led me to ini@@ ti@@ ate a program called S@@ ound S@@ cien@@ ce .
"I saw the power of D@@ u@@ ke &apos;s s@@ ong with urb@@ an y@@ outh — an audience , you know , I as a mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ aged prof@@ ess@@ or , I don &apos;t have a hope of getting to — in terms of con@@ v@@ in@@ cing them of the import@@ ance of wil@@ d@@ l@@ ands ."
"So I eng@@ aged C@@ au@@ tion , this ra@@ p sing@@ er , with a group of young people from in@@ ner@@ -@@ city T@@ ac@@ om@@ a ."
"We went out to the fore@@ st , I would pi@@ ck up a bran@@ ch , C@@ au@@ tion would ra@@ p on it , and sud@@ den@@ ly that bran@@ ch was really cool ."
"And then the students would come into our sound studi@@ os , they would make their own ra@@ p son@@ gs with their own be@@ ats ."
"They en@@ ded up making a C@@ D which they took home to their family and friends , ther@@ e@@ by ex@@ pres@@ sing their own exper@@ ien@@ ces with nature in their own medi@@ um ."
"The fin@@ al project I &apos;ll talk about is one that &apos;s very close to my heart , and it inv@@ ol@@ ves an economic and social val@@ ue that is as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with epi@@ ph@@ y@@ tic plan@@ ts ."
"In the P@@ aci@@ fic Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est , there &apos;s a whole indu@@ stry of mo@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ har@@ v@@ est@@ ing from ol@@ d-@@ grow@@ th fore@@ sts ."
"These mo@@ s@@ ses are taken from the fore@@ st ; they &apos;re used by the fl@@ ori@@ culture indu@@ stry , by fl@@ or@@ ist@@ s , to make ar@@ r@@ ang@@ em@@ ents and make h@@ ang@@ ing bas@@ ke@@ ts ."
It &apos;s a 2@@ 6@@ 5 million dol@@ lar indu@@ stry and it &apos;s incre@@ as@@ ing ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly .
"If you remember that bal@@ d guy , you &apos;ll know that what has been stri@@ pped off of these tru@@ n@@ ks in the P@@ aci@@ fic Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est ol@@ d-@@ grow@@ th fore@@ st is going to take de@@ ca@@ des and de@@ ca@@ des to come back ."
So this whole indu@@ stry is un@@ susta@@ in@@ able .
"What can I , as an e@@ co@@ logi@@ st , do about that ?"
"Well , my thought was that I could learn how to gro@@ w mo@@ s@@ ses , and that way we wouldn &apos;t have to take them out of the wi@@ ld ."
"And I thought , if I had some part@@ n@@ ers that could help me with this , that would be great ."
"And so , I thought per@@ haps in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated men and women — who don &apos;t have ac@@ cess to nature , who often have a lot of time , they often have space , and you don &apos;t need any sh@@ ar@@ p to@@ ols to work with mo@@ s@@ ses — would be great part@@ n@@ ers ."
And they have become ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent part@@ n@@ ers .
The best I can imagine .
They were very en@@ th@@ usi@@ a@@ stic .
( Applause ) They were incredi@@ bly en@@ th@@ usi@@ a@@ stic about the work .
"They learned how to di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ h different species of mo@@ s@@ ses , which , to tell you the tru@@ th , is a lot more than my under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate students at the E@@ ver@@ green Col@@ le@@ ge can do ."
And they em@@ brac@@ ed the idea that they could help develo@@ p a research design in order to gro@@ w these mo@@ s@@ ses .
"We &apos;ve been suc@@ cess@@ ful as part@@ n@@ ers in fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing out which species gro@@ w the f@@ ast@@ est , and I &apos;ve just been over@@ wh@@ el@@ med with how suc@@ cess@@ ful this has been ."
"Because the pri@@ son war@@ den@@ s were very en@@ th@@ usi@@ a@@ stic about this as well , I started a S@@ cien@@ ce and Su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability S@@ em@@ in@@ ar in the pri@@ s@@ ons ."
I brought my scienti@@ fic colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es and susta@@ in@@ ability prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers into the pri@@ son .
"We gave tal@@ ks once a mon@@ th , and that actually en@@ ded up im@@ ple@@ ment@@ ing some amazing susta@@ in@@ ability proje@@ cts at the pri@@ s@@ ons — organi@@ c gar@@ den@@ s , wor@@ m culture , re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling , water cat@@ ch@@ ment and be@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ ping . ( Applause ) O@@ ur lat@@ est en@@ de@@ av@@ or , with a gr@@ ant from the De@@ part@@ ment of C@@ or@@ re@@ ctions at W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton state , they &apos;ve asked us to ex@@ p@@ and this program to three more pri@@ s@@ ons ."
And our new project is having the in@@ mat@@ es and ourselves learn how to ra@@ ise the O@@ re@@ g@@ on spo@@ t@@ ted fro@@ g which is a high@@ ly en@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed am@@ phi@@ bi@@ an in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton state and O@@ re@@ g@@ on .
"So they will ra@@ ise them — in cap@@ ti@@ vity , of course — from e@@ g@@ gs to t@@ ad@@ po@@ les and on@@ ward to fro@@ gs ."
"And they will have the ple@@ as@@ ure , many of them , of seeing those fro@@ gs that they &apos;ve ra@@ is@@ ed from e@@ g@@ gs and hel@@ ped develo@@ p , hel@@ ped n@@ ur@@ ture , move out into prote@@ cted wil@@ d@@ l@@ ands to au@@ g@@ ment the number of en@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed species out there in the wi@@ ld ."
"And so , I think for many reas@@ ons — e@@ co@@ logi@@ cal , social , economic and per@@ haps even spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al — this has been a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous project and I &apos;m really looking forward to not only myself and my students doing it , but also to pro@@ mot@@ e and te@@ ach other scienti@@ sts how to do this ."
"As many of you are aw@@ are , the world of ac@@ a@@ demi@@ a is a rather in@@ war@@ d-@@ looking one ."
I &apos;m trying to help resear@@ ch@@ ers move more ou@@ tw@@ ard to have their own part@@ ner@@ ships with people outside of the ac@@ a@@ demi@@ c community .
"And so I &apos;m hop@@ ing that my h@@ us@@ b@@ and J@@ ack , the ant ta@@ x@@ on@@ omi@@ st , can per@@ haps work with M@@ at@@ te@@ l to make T@@ ax@@ on@@ omi@@ st K@@ en ."
P@@ er@@ haps B@@ en Z@@ an@@ der and Bi@@ ll G@@ ates could get together and make an op@@ era about AIDS .
O@@ r per@@ haps A@@ l G@@ ore and N@@ atur@@ ally 7 could make a s@@ ong about clim@@ ate change that would really make you c@@ la@@ p your h@@ ands .
"So , al@@ though it &apos;s a little bit of a fan@@ t@@ asy , I think it &apos;s also a re@@ ality ."
"G@@ i@@ ven the du@@ re@@ ss that we &apos;re feeling environ@@ ment@@ ally in these times , it is time for scienti@@ sts to re@@ ach ou@@ tw@@ ard , and time for those outside of science to re@@ ach towar@@ ds ac@@ a@@ demi@@ a as well ."
I started my car@@ e@@ er with trying to understand the m@@ yst@@ er@@ ies of fore@@ sts with the to@@ ols of science .
"B@@ y making these part@@ ner@@ ships that I descri@@ bed to you , I have really open@@ ed my mind and , I have to say , my heart to have a gre@@ ater under@@ standing , to make other disco@@ ver@@ ies about nature and myself ."
"When I look into my heart , I see tre@@ es — this is actually an image of a real heart — there are tre@@ es in our hear@@ ts , there are tre@@ es in your hear@@ ts ."
"When we come to understand nature , we are tou@@ ching the most de@@ ep , the most important par@@ ts of our self ."
"In these part@@ ner@@ ships , I have also learned that people ten@@ d to com@@ part@@ ment@@ ali@@ ze themselves into I@@ T people , and movie st@@ ar people , and scienti@@ sts , but when we share nature , when we share our perspe@@ cti@@ ves about nature , we find a common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , as a scienti@@ st and as a person and now , as part of the TED community , I feel that I have better to@@ ols to go out to tre@@ es , to go out to fore@@ sts , to go out to nature , to make new disco@@ ver@@ ies about nature — and about hum@@ ans &apos; place in nature wh@@ er@@ ever we are and wh@@ om@@ ever you are ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And cro@@ c@@ od@@ i@@ les were not be@@ having at that time either .
"In 200@@ 2 , a group of tre@@ at@@ ment acti@@ vi@@ sts met to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s the early develo@@ pment of the air@@ pl@@ ane ."
"The W@@ right B@@ ro@@ thers , in the beginning of the last century , had for the first time man@@ aged to make one of those de@@ vi@@ ces f@@ ly ."
They also had taken out num@@ er@@ ous pat@@ ents on essen@@ tial par@@ ts of the air@@ pl@@ ane .
They were not the only ones .
"That was common prac@@ ti@@ ce in the indu@@ stry , and those who he@@ ld pat@@ ents on air@@ plan@@ es were def@@ ending them f@@ ier@@ ce@@ ly and su@@ ing compe@@ ti@@ t@@ ors left and right ."
"This actually wasn &apos;t so great for the develo@@ pment of the avi@@ ation indu@@ stry , and this was at a time that in particular the U.@@ S. government was interested in ra@@ m@@ ping up the produ@@ ction of mi@@ lit@@ ary air@@ plan@@ es ."
So there was a bit of a con@@ fli@@ ct there .
"The U.@@ S. government decided to take action , and for@@ ced those pat@@ ent hol@@ ders to make their pat@@ ents available to share with others to en@@ able the produ@@ ction of air@@ plan@@ es ."
So what has this got to do with this ?
"In 200@@ 2 , N@@ el@@ son O@@ tw@@ om@@ a , a Ken@@ y@@ an social scienti@@ st , disco@@ vered he had HIV and needed ac@@ cess to tre@@ at@@ ment ."
He was told that a cu@@ re did not exi@@ st .
"A@@ ID@@ S , he heard , was le@@ th@@ al , and tre@@ at@@ ment was not of@@ fer@@ ed . This was at a time that tre@@ at@@ ment actually ex@@ ist@@ ed in ri@@ ch countries ."
AIDS had become a chro@@ nic dise@@ ase .
"P@@ e@@ ople in our countries here in Europ@@ e , in Nor@@ th America , were living with HIV , health@@ y lives ."
"N@@ ot so for N@@ el@@ son . He wasn &apos;t ri@@ ch enough , and not so for his thre@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ old son , who he disco@@ vered a year later also had HIV ."
N@@ el@@ son decided to become a tre@@ at@@ ment acti@@ vi@@ st and jo@@ in up with other grou@@ ps .
"In 200@@ 2 , they were fac@@ ing a different bat@@ tle ."
"P@@ ri@@ ces for A@@ R@@ V@@ s , the dru@@ gs needed to tre@@ at HIV , cost about 1@@ 2@@ ,000 &#91; dollars &#93; per patien@@ t per year ."
The pat@@ ents on those dru@@ gs were he@@ ld by a number of W@@ est@@ er@@ n ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ tical comp@@ an@@ ies that were not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly wil@@ ling to make those pat@@ ents available .
"When you have a pat@@ ent , you can ex@@ clu@@ de any@@ one else from making , from produ@@ cing or making low@@ -@@ cost ver@@ sions , for example , available of those medi@@ c@@ ations ."
C@@ lear@@ ly this led to pat@@ ent war@@ s bre@@ aking out all over the g@@ lo@@ be .
"Lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly , those pat@@ ents did not exi@@ st every@@ where ."
"There were countries that did not re@@ cogni@@ ze ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ tical produ@@ ct pat@@ ents , such as Indi@@ a , and Indi@@ an ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ tical comp@@ an@@ ies started to produ@@ ce so@@ -@@ called gen@@ eri@@ c ver@@ sions , low@@ -@@ cost cop@@ ies of anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral medi@@ cin@@ es , and make them available in the develo@@ ping world , and within a year the pri@@ ce had come down from 1@@ 0,000 dollars per patien@@ t per year to 3@@ 50 dollars per patien@@ t per year , and today that same tri@@ ple pi@@ ll co@@ c@@ kt@@ a@@ il is available for 60 dollars per patien@@ t per year , and of course that started to have an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous effe@@ ct on the number of people who could af@@ for@@ d ac@@ cess to those medi@@ cin@@ es ."
"T@@ re@@ at@@ ment progra@@ ms became possible , fun@@ ding became available , and the number of people on anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral dru@@ gs started to incre@@ ase very ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , eight million people have ac@@ cess to anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral dru@@ gs ."
Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ four million are in@@ fe@@ cted with HIV .
"N@@ ever has this number been so high , but actually this is good news , because what it means is people stop dy@@ ing ."
Pe@@ ople who have ac@@ cess to these dru@@ gs stop dy@@ ing .
And there &apos;s something else .
They also stop pas@@ sing on the vi@@ ru@@ s .
This is fa@@ ir@@ ly re@@ cent science that has sh@@ own that .
What that means is we have the to@@ ols to bre@@ ak the back of this epi@@ demi@@ c .
So what &apos;s the problem ?
"Well , things have changed ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , the ru@@ les have changed ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , all countries are ob@@ li@@ g@@ ed to provi@@ de pat@@ ents for ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ ti@@ cal@@ s that last at least 20 years ."
This is as a resul@@ t of the in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al pro@@ per@@ ty ru@@ les of the World T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ gani@@ z@@ ation .
So what Indi@@ a did is no longer possible .
"S@@ econ@@ d , the prac@@ ti@@ ce of pat@@ ent@@ -@@ hol@@ ding comp@@ an@@ ies have changed ."
"H@@ ere you see the pat@@ ent prac@@ ti@@ ces before the World T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ gani@@ z@@ ation &apos;s ru@@ les , before &apos; 9@@ 5 , before anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral dru@@ gs ."
"This is what you see today , and this is in develo@@ ping countries , so what that means is , un@@ less we do something deli@@ ber@@ ate and un@@ less we do something now , we will very so@@ on be fac@@ ed with another dru@@ g pri@@ ce cri@@ sis , because new dru@@ gs are develo@@ ped , new dru@@ gs go to market , but these medi@@ cin@@ es are pat@@ en@@ ted in a much wi@@ der r@@ ange of countries ."
"So un@@ less we act , un@@ less we do something today , we will so@@ on be fac@@ ed &#91; with &#93; what some have ter@@ med the tre@@ at@@ ment time b@@ om@@ b ."
It isn &apos;t only the number of dru@@ gs that are pat@@ en@@ ted .
There &apos;s something else that can really sc@@ are gen@@ eri@@ c man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers away .
This shows you a pat@@ ent land@@ s@@ cape .
This is the land@@ s@@ cape of one medi@@ cine .
"So you can imagine that if you are a gen@@ eri@@ c company about to deci@@ de whether to inv@@ est in the develo@@ pment of this produ@@ ct , un@@ less you know that the li@@ cen@@ ses to these pat@@ ents are actually going to be available , you will probably cho@@ ose to do something else ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , deli@@ ber@@ ate action is needed ."
"So su@@ re@@ ly if a pat@@ ent po@@ ol could be est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed to ra@@ m@@ p up the produ@@ ction of mi@@ lit@@ ary air@@ plan@@ es , we should be able to do something si@@ mi@@ lar to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le the HIV / AIDS epi@@ demi@@ c ."
And we did .
"In 20@@ 10 , U@@ N@@ I@@ T@@ A@@ I@@ D est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed the Me@@ di@@ cin@@ es P@@ at@@ ent Po@@ ol for HIV ."
"And this is how it works : P@@ at@@ ent hol@@ ders , inv@@ ent@@ ors that develo@@ p new medi@@ cin@@ es pat@@ ent those inv@@ en@@ tions , but make those pat@@ ents available to the Me@@ di@@ cin@@ es P@@ at@@ ent Po@@ ol . The Me@@ di@@ cin@@ es P@@ at@@ ent Po@@ ol then li@@ cen@@ se those out to wh@@ o@@ ever needs ac@@ cess to those pat@@ ents ."
That can be gen@@ eri@@ c man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers .

"Th@@ ose man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers can then se@@ ll those medi@@ cin@@ es at much low@@ er cost to people who need ac@@ cess to them , to tre@@ at@@ ment progra@@ ms that need ac@@ cess to them ."

There is one key difference with the air@@ pl@@ ane pat@@ ent po@@ ol .
The Me@@ di@@ cin@@ es P@@ at@@ ent Po@@ ol is a vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary mechani@@ sm .
The air@@ pl@@ ane pat@@ ent hol@@ ders were not left a cho@@ ice whether they &apos;d li@@ cen@@ se their pat@@ ents or not .
They were for@@ ced to do so .
That is something that the Me@@ di@@ cin@@ es P@@ at@@ ent Po@@ ol cannot do .
It rel@@ ies on the wil@@ lin@@ g@@ ness of ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ tical comp@@ an@@ ies to li@@ cen@@ se their pat@@ ents and make them available for others to use .
"T@@ od@@ ay , N@@ el@@ son O@@ tw@@ om@@ a is health@@ y ."

"N@@ el@@ son is a member of the exper@@ t ad@@ vi@@ sor@@ y group of the Me@@ di@@ cin@@ es P@@ at@@ ent Po@@ ol , and he told me not so long ago , &quot; &quot; E@@ l@@ le@@ n , we re@@ ly in Ken@@ ya and in many other countries on the Me@@ di@@ cin@@ es P@@ at@@ ent Po@@ ol to make sure that new medi@@ cin@@ es also become available to us , that new medi@@ cin@@ es , without de@@ l@@ ay , become available to us . &quot; &quot; And this is no longer fan@@ t@@ asy ."

This has never been done before .

This has never been seen before .
"N@@ el@@ son &apos;s expe@@ ct@@ ations are very high , and quite ri@@ gh@@ tly so .

"Now we coun@@ t on the wil@@ lin@@ g@@ ness of dru@@ g comp@@ an@@ ies to make that happen .

Thank you . ( Applause )
Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : W@@ el@@ come to TED .
Ri@@ ch@@ ard B@@ ran@@ son : Thank you very much . The first TED has been great .
CA : Ha@@ ve you met any@@ one interesting ?
"R@@ B : Well , the nice thing about TED is everybody &apos;s interesting ."
"I was very gl@@ ad to see G@@ ol@@ die H@@ aw@@ n , because I had an apo@@ logy to make to her ."
I &apos;d had din@@ ner with her about two years ago and I &apos;d — she had this big we@@ d@@ ding ring and I put it on my fin@@ ger and I couldn &apos;t get it off .
"And I went home to my wi@@ fe that night and she wanted to know why I had another woman &apos;s big , mas@@ sive , big we@@ d@@ ding ring on my fin@@ ger ."
"And , any@@ way , the next morning we had to go along to the je@@ we@@ ler and get it cut off ."
So — ( Laughter ) — so apo@@ log@@ ies to G@@ ol@@ die .
CA : That &apos;s pretty good .
"So , we &apos;re going to put up some sli@@ des of some of your comp@@ an@@ ies here ."
You &apos;ve started one or two in your time .
"So , you know , V@@ ir@@ g@@ in At@@ lan@@ tic , V@@ ir@@ g@@ in Re@@ cor@@ ds — I gu@@ ess it all started with a mag@@ az@@ ine called S@@ tu@@ dent ."
"And then , y@@ es , all these other ones as well . I mean , how do you do this ?"
"R@@ B : I read all these sort of TED instru@@ ctions : you must not talk about your own business , and this , and now you ask me ."
"So I sup@@ pos@@ e you &apos;re not going to be able to ki@@ ck me off the st@@ age , since you asked the question ."
( Laughter ) CA : It depen@@ ds what the answer is though .
"R@@ B : No , I mean , I think I learned early on that if you can run one company , you can really run any comp@@ an@@ ies ."
"I mean , comp@@ an@@ ies are all about fin@@ ding the right people , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing those people , you know , d@@ raw@@ ing out the best in people ."
"And I just love lear@@ ning and I &apos;m incredi@@ bly in@@ qui@@ si@@ tive and I love taking on , you know , the stat@@ us qu@@ o and trying to turn it up@@ side down ."
So I &apos;ve seen life as one long lear@@ ning process .
"And if I see — you know , if I f@@ ly on somebody else &apos;s air@@ line and find the experience is not a ple@@ as@@ ant one , which it wasn &apos;t , 2@@ 1 years ago , then I &apos;d think , well , you know , maybe I can create the kind of air@@ line that I &apos;d like to f@@ ly on ."
"And so , you know , so got one secon@@ d@@ hand 7@@ 4@@ 7 from Bo@@ e@@ ing and gave it a go ."
"CA : Well , that was a bi@@ zar@@ re thing , because you made this move that a lot of people ad@@ vi@@ sed you was c@@ razy ."
"And in fact , in a way , it almost took down your em@@ pi@@ re at one point ."
"I had a convers@@ ation with one of the inv@@ est@@ ment ban@@ k@@ ers who , at the time when you basically s@@ old V@@ ir@@ g@@ in Re@@ cor@@ ds and inv@@ est@@ ed he@@ avi@@ ly in V@@ ir@@ g@@ in At@@ lan@@ tic , and his view was that you were tra@@ ding , you know , the world &apos;s f@@ our@@ th bi@@ ggest recor@@ d company for the tw@@ en@@ ty@@ -@@ fi@@ f@@ th bi@@ ggest air@@ line and that you were out of your mind ."
Why did you do that ?
"R@@ B : Well , I think that there &apos;s a very th@@ in di@@ vi@@ ding line between suc@@ cess and fai@@ lu@@ re ."
"And I think if you start a business without fin@@ an@@ cial bac@@ king , you &apos;re li@@ ke@@ ly to go the wrong side of that di@@ vi@@ ding line ."
We had — we were being att@@ ac@@ ked by Bri@@ ti@@ sh A@@ ir@@ ways .
"They were trying to put our air@@ line out of business , and they la@@ un@@ ched what &apos;s become known as the di@@ r@@ ty tri@@ cks cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n ."
And I realized that the whole em@@ pi@@ re was li@@ ke@@ ly to come c@@ ra@@ sh@@ ing down un@@ less I chi@@ pped in a chi@@ p .
"And in order to prote@@ ct the j@@ ob@@ s of the people who worked for the air@@ line , and prote@@ ct the j@@ ob@@ s of the people who worked for the recor@@ d company , I had to se@@ ll the family je@@ wel@@ ry to prote@@ ct the air@@ line ."
"CA : P@@ ost@@ -@@ N@@ ap@@ ster , you &apos;re looking like a bit of a g@@ eni@@ us , actually , for that as well ."
"R@@ B : Yeah , as it turned out , it pro@@ ved to be the right move ."
"But , ye@@ ah , it was sa@@ d at the time , but we mo@@ ved on ."
"CA : Now , you use the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in br@@ and a lot and it seem@@ s like you &apos;re getting sy@@ ner@@ gy from one thing to the other ."
What does the br@@ and stand for in your head ?
"R@@ B : Well , I like to think it stan@@ ds for qu@@ ality , that you know , if somebody comes across a V@@ ir@@ g@@ in company , they — CA : They are qu@@ ality , Ri@@ ch@@ ard . C@@ ome on now , everyone says qu@@ ality . S@@ pi@@ r@@ it ?"
"R@@ B : No , but I was going to move on this ."
We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it en@@ jo@@ y it .
"As I say , we go in and sha@@ ke up other indu@@ str@@ ies , and I think , you know , we do it differ@@ ently and I think that indu@@ str@@ ies are not quite the same as a resul@@ t of V@@ ir@@ g@@ in att@@ ac@@ king the market ."
"CA : I mean , there are a few la@@ un@@ ch@@ es you &apos;ve done where the br@@ and maybe ha@@ sn &apos;t worked quite as well ."
"I mean , V@@ ir@@ g@@ in Bri@@ des — what happened there ?"
( Laughter ) R@@ B : We couldn &apos;t find any cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) CA : I was actually also cu@@ ri@@ ous why — I think you mis@@ sed an opportunity with your con@@ dom@@ s la@@ un@@ ch . You called it M@@ ates .
"I mean , couldn &apos;t you have used the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in br@@ and for that as well ?"
"A@@ in &apos;t vi@@ r@@ g@@ in no longer , or something ."
"R@@ B : A@@ ga@@ in , we may have had problems fin@@ ding cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ."
"I mean , we had — often , when you la@@ un@@ ch a company and you get cu@@ st@@ om@@ er com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts , you know , you can deal with them ."
"But about three months after the la@@ un@@ ch of the con@@ dom company , I had a let@@ ter , a com@@ pla@@ int , and I s@@ at down and wro@@ te a long let@@ ter back to this l@@ ady apo@@ logi@@ z@@ ing prof@@ us@@ ely ."
"But obvi@@ ously , there wasn &apos;t a lot I could do about it ."
"And then six months later , or n@@ ine months after the problem had taken , I got this deli@@ gh@@ t@@ ful let@@ ter with a picture of the b@@ aby as@@ king if I &apos;d be god@@ father , which I became ."
"So , it all worked out well ."
CA : Re@@ ally ? You should have brought a picture . That &apos;s wonderful .
R@@ B : I should have .
"CA : So , just help us with some of the num@@ bers ."
"I mean , what are the num@@ bers on this ?"
"I mean , how big is the group over@@ all ?"
How much — what &apos;s the tot@@ al re@@ ven@@ ue ?
"R@@ B : It &apos;s about 25 billion dollars now , in tot@@ al ."
CA : And how many em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es ?
"R@@ B : A@@ b@@ out 5@@ 5@@ ,000 ."
"CA : So , you &apos;ve been photograph@@ ed in v@@ ari@@ ous ways at v@@ ari@@ ous times and never wor@@ ry@@ ing about pu@@ tting your di@@ gni@@ ty on the line or anything like that ."
What was that ? W@@ as that real ?
"R@@ B : Yeah . We were la@@ un@@ ching a me@@ ga@@ stor@@ e in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , I think ."
"No , I mean , I think — CA : But is that your ha@@ ir ?"
R@@ B : No .
CA : What was that one ?
R@@ B : D@@ ro@@ pping in for te@@ a .
CA : OK .
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : A@@ h , that was quite fun . That was a wonderful car@@ -@@ boat in which — CA : Oh , that car that we — actually we — it was a TE@@ D@@ ster ev@@ ent there , I think ."
"I@@ s that — could you still pa@@ use on that one actually , for a minu@@ te ?"
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : It &apos;s a t@@ ough job , isn &apos;t it ?"
"CA : I mean , it is a t@@ ough job ."
"( Laughter ) When I first came to America , I used to try this with em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es as well and they kind of — they have these different ru@@ les over here , it &apos;s very str@@ ange ."
"R@@ B : I know , I have — the la@@ wy@@ ers say you mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t do things like that , but — CA : I mean , spe@@ aking of which , tell us about — R@@ B : &quot; &quot; P@@ am@@ my &quot; &quot; we la@@ un@@ ched , you know — mist@@ ak@@ en@@ ly thought we could take on Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a , and we la@@ un@@ ched a col@@ a bot@@ tle called &quot; &quot; The P@@ am@@ my &quot; &quot; and it was sha@@ ped a bit like P@@ am@@ el@@ a An@@ der@@ son ."
"But the t@@ rou@@ ble is , it ke@@ pt on ti@@ pping over , but — ( Laughter ) CA : De@@ sig@@ ned by P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ e St@@ ar@@ ck per@@ haps ?"
R@@ B : O@@ f course .
"CA : So , we &apos;ll just run a couple more pi@@ ctures here . V@@ ir@@ g@@ in Bri@@ des . V@@ ery nice ."
"And , OK , so stop there . This was — you had some aw@@ ard I think ?"
"R@@ B : Yeah , well , 25 years ear@@ lie@@ r , we &apos;d la@@ un@@ ched the Se@@ x P@@ ist@@ ols &apos; &quot; &quot; God S@@ a@@ ve The Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;d cer@@ tain@@ ly never expe@@ cted that 25 years later — that she &apos;d actually k@@ night us ."
"But some@@ how , she must have had a for@@ ge@@ t@@ ful memor@@ y , I think ."
"CA : Well , God sa@@ ved her and you got your just re@@ ward ."
"D@@ o you like to be called S@@ ir Ri@@ ch@@ ard , or how ?"
R@@ B : N@@ ob@@ ody &apos;s ever called me S@@ ir Ri@@ ch@@ ard .
"O@@ c@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally in America , I hear people saying S@@ ir Ri@@ ch@@ ard and think there &apos;s some S@@ ha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are@@ an play taking place ."
But now@@ here else any@@ way .
CA : OK . So can you use your k@@ ni@@ gh@@ th@@ o@@ od for anything or is it just ...
"R@@ B : No . I sup@@ pos@@ e if you &apos;re having problems getting a boo@@ king in a re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant or something , that might be wor@@ th using it ."
"CA : You know , it &apos;s not Ri@@ ch@@ ard B@@ ran@@ son . It &apos;s S@@ ir Ri@@ ch@@ ard B@@ ran@@ son ."
R@@ B : I &apos;ll go get the se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary to use it .
CA : OK . So let &apos;s look at the space thing .
"I think , with us , we &apos;ve got a video that shows what you &apos;re up to , and V@@ ir@@ g@@ in G@@ al@@ ac@@ tic up in the air . ( V@@ ide@@ o ) So that &apos;s the B@@ er@@ t R@@ ut@@ an desig@@ ned sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p ?"
"R@@ B : Yeah , it &apos;ll be ready in — well , ready in 12 months and then we do 12 months ex@@ ten@@ sive test@@ ing ."
"And then 2@@ 4 months from now , people will be able to take a ri@@ de into space ."
CA : So this inter@@ i@@ or is P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ e St@@ ar@@ c@@ ke desig@@ ned ?
"R@@ B : P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ e has done the — ye@@ ah , quite a bit of it : the lo@@ go@@ s and he &apos;s building the space st@@ ation in New M@@ exi@@ co ."
"And basically , he &apos;s just taken an ey@@ e and the space st@@ ation will be one gi@@ ant ey@@ e , so when you &apos;re in space , you ou@@ ght to be able to see this mas@@ sive ey@@ e looking up at you ."
"And when you land , you &apos;ll be able to go back into this gi@@ ant ey@@ e ."
But he &apos;s an absolu@@ te g@@ eni@@ us when it comes to design .
CA : But you didn &apos;t have him design the eng@@ ine ?
"R@@ B : P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ e is quite er@@ r@@ atic , so I think that he wouldn &apos;t be the best person to design the eng@@ ine , no ."
CA : He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago .
"R@@ B : Yeah ? No , he is a — CA : Well , some people found it wonderful , some people found it completely bi@@ zar@@ re ."
"But , I per@@ son@@ ally found it wonderful ."
"R@@ B : He &apos;s a wonderful en@@ th@@ usi@@ ast , which is why I love him . But ..."
"CA : So , now , you &apos;ve always had this expl@@ or@@ ation bu@@ g in you ."
Ha@@ ve you ever re@@ gre@@ t@@ ted that ?
R@@ B : M@@ any times .
"I mean , I think with the bal@@ lo@@ on@@ ing and bo@@ ating expe@@ di@@ tions we &apos;ve done in the past ."
"Well , I got pul@@ led out of the se@@ a I think six times by he@@ lic@@ op@@ ters , so — and each time , I didn &apos;t expe@@ ct to come home to tell the t@@ ale ."
"So in those mom@@ ents , you cer@@ tain@@ ly won@@ der what you &apos;re doing up there or — CA : What was the clo@@ s@@ est you got to — when did you think , this is it , I might be on my way out ?"
"R@@ B : Well , I think the bal@@ lo@@ on ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ res were — each one was , each one , actually , I think we came close ."
"And , I mean , first of all we — no@@ body had actually cro@@ s@@ sed the At@@ lan@@ tic in a ho@@ t air bal@@ lo@@ on before , so we had to build a ho@@ t air bal@@ lo@@ on that was cap@@ able of fl@@ ying in the je@@ t stre@@ am , and we wer@@ en &apos;t quite sure , when a bal@@ lo@@ on actually got into the je@@ t stre@@ am , whether it would actually survi@@ ve the 2@@ 00 , 2@@ 20 miles an hour win@@ ds that you can find up there ."
"And so , just the ini@@ tial li@@ ft off from Su@@ gar@@ lo@@ a@@ f to c@@ ross the At@@ lan@@ tic , as we were p@@ us@@ h@@ ing into the je@@ t stre@@ am , this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous bal@@ lo@@ on — the top of the bal@@ lo@@ on en@@ ded up going at a couple of hundre@@ d miles an hour , the cap@@ su@@ le that we were in at the bot@@ tom was going at maybe two miles an hour , and it just took off ."
And it was like hol@@ ding on@@ to a thous@@ and hor@@ ses .
"And we were just cro@@ s@@ sing every fin@@ ger , pra@@ ying that the bal@@ lo@@ on would h@@ old together , which , for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , it did ."
"But the en@@ ds of all those bal@@ lo@@ on tri@@ ps were , you know — something seem@@ ed to go wrong every time , and on that particular oc@@ ca@@ sion , the more exper@@ ien@@ ced bal@@ lo@@ oni@@ st who was with me j@@ um@@ ped , and left me hol@@ ding on for de@@ ar life ."
"( Laughter ) CA : D@@ id he tell you to j@@ um@@ p , or he just said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m out of here ! &quot; &quot; and ..."
"R@@ B : No , he told me j@@ um@@ p , but once his we@@ ight had gone , the bal@@ lo@@ on just sh@@ ot up to 1@@ 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et and I ..."
CA : And you inspi@@ red an I@@ an M@@ c@@ E@@ wa@@ n no@@ vel I think with that .
"R@@ B : Yeah . No , I put on my o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en mas@@ k and sto@@ od on top of the bal@@ lo@@ on , with my par@@ ach@@ u@@ te , looking at the s@@ wi@@ r@@ ling cl@@ ou@@ ds be@@ low , trying to p@@ lu@@ ck up my cou@@ ra@@ ge to j@@ um@@ p into the Nor@@ th Se@@ a , which — and it was a very , very , very lon@@ ely few mom@@ ents ."
"But , any@@ way , we man@@ aged to survi@@ ve it ."
CA : D@@ id you j@@ um@@ p ? O@@ r it came down in the end ?
"R@@ B : Well , I knew I had about half an hour &apos;s fu@@ el left , and I also knew that the ch@@ an@@ ces were that if I j@@ um@@ ped , I would only have a couple of minutes of life left ."
So I clim@@ bed back into the cap@@ su@@ le and just des@@ per@@ ately tr@@ ied to make sure that I was making the right deci@@ sion .
"And wro@@ te some not@@ es to my family . And then clim@@ bed back up again , looked down at those cl@@ ou@@ ds again , clim@@ bed back into the cap@@ su@@ le again ."
"And then finally , just thought , there &apos;s a better way ."
"I &apos;ve got , you know , this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous bal@@ lo@@ on ab@@ o@@ ve me , it &apos;s the bi@@ ggest par@@ ach@@ u@@ te ever , why not use it ?"
"And so I man@@ aged to f@@ ly the bal@@ lo@@ on down through the cl@@ ou@@ ds , and about 50 fe@@ et , before I h@@ it the se@@ a , thre@@ w myself over ."
"And the bal@@ lo@@ on h@@ it the se@@ a and went sho@@ ot@@ ing back up to 1@@ 0,000 fe@@ et without me ."
But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and — CA : What did you write to your family ?
"R@@ B : J@@ ust what you would do in a situ@@ ation like that : just I love you very much . And I &apos;d already wri@@ t@@ ten them a let@@ ter before going on this tri@@ p , which — just in case anything had happened ."
"But for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , they never had to use it ."
CA : Y@@ our comp@@ an@@ ies have had incredible P@@ R val@@ ue out of these her@@ o@@ i@@ cs .
"The years — and until I stop@@ ped looking at the pol@@ ls , you were sort of re@@ gar@@ ded as this great her@@ o in the U.@@ K@@ . and el@@ se@@ where ."
"And cy@@ ni@@ cs might say , you know , this is just a s@@ mar@@ t business guy doing what it takes to ex@@ e@@ cu@@ te his particular sty@@ le of marke@@ ting ."
How much was the P@@ R val@@ ue part of this ?
"R@@ B : Well , of course , the P@@ R exper@@ ts said that as an air@@ line ow@@ ner , the last thing you should be doing is he@@ ading off in bal@@ lo@@ ons and bo@@ ats , and c@@ ra@@ sh@@ ing into the se@@ as ."
"( Laughter ) CA : They have a point , Ri@@ ch@@ ard ."
"R@@ B : In fact , I think our air@@ line took a full p@@ age ad at the time saying , you know , come on , Ri@@ ch@@ ard , there are better ways of cro@@ s@@ sing the At@@ lan@@ tic ."
"( Laughter ) CA : To do all this , you must have been a g@@ eni@@ us from the ge@@ t-@@ go , right ?"
"R@@ B : Well , I won &apos;t con@@ tra@@ di@@ ct that ."
"( Laughter ) CA : OK , this isn &apos;t exactly har@@ d@@ ball . OK ."
D@@ i@@ dn &apos;t — wer@@ en &apos;t you just terri@@ ble at school ?
R@@ B : I was dy@@ sle@@ x@@ ic . I had no under@@ standing of scho@@ ol@@ work wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever .
I cer@@ tain@@ ly would have fai@@ led I@@ Q te@@ sts .
And it was one of the reas@@ ons I left school when I was 15 years old .
"And if I — if I &apos;m not interested in something , I don &apos;t gra@@ s@@ p it ."
"As somebody who &apos;s dy@@ sle@@ x@@ ic , you also have some quite bi@@ zar@@ re situ@@ ations ."
"I mean , for in@@ stance , I &apos;ve had to — you know , I &apos;ve been ru@@ n@@ ning the largest group of pri@@ v@@ ate comp@@ an@@ ies in Europ@@ e , but ha@@ ven &apos;t been able to know the difference between net and g@@ ross ."
And so the bo@@ ard me@@ et@@ ings have been fas@@ cin@@ ating .
"( Laughter ) And so , it &apos;s like , good news or bad news ?"
"And gener@@ ally , the people would say , oh , well that &apos;s bad news ."
"CA : But just to c@@ lar@@ i@@ fy , the 25 billion dollars is g@@ ross , right ? That &apos;s g@@ ross ?"
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : Well , I hope it &apos;s net actually , having — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;ve got it right ."
"CA : No , tr@@ ust me , it &apos;s g@@ ross ."
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : So , when I turned 50 , somebody took me outside the bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om and said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook Ri@@ ch@@ ard , here &apos;s a — let me dra@@ w on a di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s a net in the se@@ a , and the fish have been pul@@ led from the se@@ a into this net ."
"And that &apos;s the pro@@ fi@@ ts you &apos;ve got left over in this little net , everything else is e@@ at@@ en . &quot; &quot; And I finally worked it all out ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : But , I mean , at school — so as well as being , you know , doing pretty mi@@ ser@@ ably ac@@ a@@ demi@@ cally , but you were also the cap@@ tain of the cri@@ ck@@ et and fo@@ ot@@ ball te@@ am@@ s ."
"So you were kind of a — you were a natural lea@@ der , but just a bit of a ... W@@ ere you a re@@ be@@ l then , or how would you ..."
"R@@ B : Yeah , I think I was a bit of a ma@@ ver@@ i@@ ck and — but I ... And I was , ye@@ ah , I was for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely good at spor@@ t , and so at least I had something to ex@@ ce@@ l at , at school ."
CA : And some bi@@ zar@@ re things happened just ear@@ lie@@ r in your life .
"I mean , there &apos;s the story about your mother al@@ le@@ ge@@ d@@ ly du@@ m@@ ping you in a fie@@ ld , aged four , and saying &quot; &quot; OK , walk home . &quot; &quot; D@@ id this really happen ?"
"R@@ B : She was , you know , she felt that we needed to stand on our own two fe@@ et from an early age ."
"So she did things to us , which now she &apos;d be ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed for , such as p@@ us@@ h@@ ing us out of the car , and tel@@ ling us to find our own way to G@@ ran@@ ny &apos;s , about five miles before we actually got there ."
"And making us go on wonderful , long bi@@ ke ri@@ des ."
And we were never allow@@ ed to wat@@ ch tele@@ vision and the like .
CA : But is there a ri@@ sk here ?
"I mean , there &apos;s a lot of people in the room who are we@@ al@@ th@@ y , and they &apos;ve got kids , and we &apos;ve got this di@@ le@@ m@@ ma about how you bring them up ."
"D@@ o you look at the cur@@ r@@ ent gener@@ ation of kids coming up and think they &apos;re too c@@ od@@ d@@ led , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;ve got , we &apos;re going to ra@@ ise a gener@@ ation of pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed ..."
"R@@ B : No , I think if you &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing up kids , you just want to s@@ mother them with love and pra@@ ise and en@@ th@@ usi@@ as@@ m ."
So I don &apos;t think you can mo@@ l@@ ly@@ c@@ od@@ d@@ le your kids too much really .
"CA : You didn &apos;t turn out too bad , I have to say , I &apos;m ..."
"@@ Y@@ our he@@ ad@@ ma@@ ster said to you — I mean he found you kind of an eni@@ g@@ ma at your school — he said , you &apos;re either going to be a mi@@ lli@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ re or go to pri@@ son , and I &apos;m not sure which ."
Wh@@ ich of those happened first ?
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : Well , I &apos;ve done both . I think I went to pri@@ son first ."
I was actually pro@@ secu@@ ted under two quite an@@ cient ac@@ ts in the U.@@ K@@ .
I was pro@@ secu@@ ted under the 1@@ 8@@ 8@@ 9 V@@ ener@@ e@@ al D@@ i@@ se@@ ases A@@ ct and the 19@@ 16 In@@ de@@ cent A@@ d@@ ver@@ ti@@ se@@ ments A@@ ct .
"O@@ n the first oc@@ ca@@ sion , for men@@ tion@@ ing the word v@@ ener@@ e@@ al dise@@ ase in public , which — we had a cen@@ ter where we would help young people who had problems ."
And one of the problems young people have is v@@ ener@@ e@@ al dise@@ ase .
And there &apos;s an an@@ cient la@@ w that says you can &apos;t actually men@@ tion the word v@@ ener@@ e@@ al dise@@ ase or pr@@ int it in public .
"So the poli@@ ce k@@ noc@@ ked on the door , and told us they were going to ar@@ rest us if we car@@ ried on men@@ tion@@ ing the word v@@ ener@@ e@@ al dise@@ ase ."
"We changed it to social dise@@ ases and people came along with ac@@ ne and spo@@ ts , but no@@ body came with V@@ D any more ."
"So , we put it back to V@@ D and pro@@ m@@ p@@ tly got ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed ."
"And then sub@@ sequ@@ ently , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever M@@ ind the B@@ ol@@ lo@@ cks , Here &apos;s the Se@@ x P@@ ist@@ ols , &quot; &quot; the word b@@ ol@@ lo@@ cks , the poli@@ ce decided was a ru@@ de word and so we were ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed for using the word b@@ ol@@ lo@@ cks on the Se@@ x P@@ ist@@ ols &apos; al@@ bu@@ m ."
"And Joh@@ n M@@ or@@ ti@@ m@@ er , the pla@@ yw@@ right , def@@ en@@ ded us ."
And he asked if I could find a lin@@ gu@@ i@@ sti@@ cs exper@@ t to come up with a different defini@@ tion of the word b@@ ol@@ lo@@ cks .
"And so I ran@@ g up N@@ ot@@ t@@ ing@@ ha@@ m Uni@@ versity , and I asked to talk to the prof@@ ess@@ or of lin@@ gu@@ i@@ sti@@ cs ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , b@@ ol@@ lo@@ cks is not a — has nothing to do with bal@@ ls wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ."
"It &apos;s actually a ni@@ ck@@ name given to pr@@ ie@@ sts in the e@@ igh@@ te@@ en@@ th century . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he went , &quot; &quot; F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , I &apos;m a pr@@ ie@@ st myself . &quot; &quot; And so I said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ould you mind coming to the cour@@ t ? &quot; &quot; And he said he &apos;d be deli@@ gh@@ ted . And I said — and he said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ould you like me to we@@ ar my do@@ g col@@ lar ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , defini@@ tely . P@@ le@@ ase . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) CA : That &apos;s great ."
"R@@ B : So our key wit@@ ness ar@@ gu@@ ed that it was actually &quot; N@@ ever M@@ ind the P@@ r@@ ie@@ st , Here &apos;s the Se@@ x P@@ ist@@ ols . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) And the ju@@ dge found us — re@@ lu@@ ct@@ an@@ tly found us not gu@@ il@@ ty , so ... ( Laughter )"
CA : That is ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ous .
"( Applause ) So seri@@ ously , is there a dar@@ k side ?"
"A lot of people would say there &apos;s no way that someone could put together this incredible colle@@ ction of bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es without k@@ ni@@ f@@ ing a few people in the back , you know , doing some u@@ g@@ ly things ."
You &apos;ve been ac@@ c@@ used of being ru@@ th@@ less .
There was a na@@ sty bi@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y wri@@ t@@ ten about you by someone .
Is any of it true ? Is there an ele@@ ment of tru@@ th in it ?
"R@@ B : I don &apos;t actually think that the ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pe of a bus@@ in@@ es@@ sp@@ er@@ son tre@@ ading all over people to get to the top , gener@@ ally spe@@ aking , works ."
"I think if you tre@@ at people well , people will come back and come back for more ."
And I think all you have in life is your re@@ pu@@ tation and it &apos;s a very small world .
"And I actually think that the best way of be@@ coming a suc@@ cess@@ ful business lea@@ der is de@@ al@@ ing with people fa@@ ir@@ ly and well , and I like to think that &apos;s how we run V@@ ir@@ g@@ in ."
"CA : And what about the people who love you and who see you sp@@ ending — you keep getting ca@@ u@@ ght up in these new proje@@ cts , but it almost feel@@ s like you &apos;re ad@@ di@@ cted to la@@ un@@ ching new stuff ."
"You get exci@@ ted by an idea and , ka@@ po@@ w !"
"I mean , do you think about life bal@@ ance ?"
How do your family feel about each time you ste@@ p into something big and new ?
"R@@ B : I also believe that being a father &apos;s incredi@@ bly important , so from the time the kids were very young , you know , when they go on ho@@ li@@ day , I go on ho@@ li@@ day with them ."
And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together .
"@@ Yes , I &apos;ll , you know , be in tou@@ ch . We &apos;re very lu@@ ck@@ y , we have this t@@ iny little is@@ land in the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an and we can — so I can take them there and we can bring friends , and we can play together , but I can also keep in tou@@ ch with what &apos;s going on ."
CA : You started talking in re@@ cent years about this ter@@ m ca@@ pit@@ ali@@ st ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ropy .
What is that ?
R@@ B : C@@ a@@ pit@@ ali@@ sm has been pro@@ ven to be a system that works .
"You know , the alter@@ n@@ ative , communi@@ sm , has not worked ."
"But the problem with ca@@ pit@@ ali@@ sm is extre@@ me we@@ alth en@@ ds up in the h@@ ands of a few people , and ther@@ e@@ fore extre@@ me respon@@ si@@ bility , I think , goes with that we@@ alth ."
"And I think it &apos;s important that the individu@@ als , who are in that for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate posi@@ tion , do not end up compe@@ ting for bi@@ g@@ ger and bi@@ g@@ ger bo@@ ats , and bi@@ g@@ ger and bi@@ g@@ ger cars , but , you know , use that money to either create new j@@ ob@@ s or to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le issu@@ es around the world ."
"CA : And what are the issu@@ es that you wor@@ ry about most , care most about , want to turn your re@@ sources tow@@ ard ?"
"R@@ B : Well , there &apos;s — I mean there &apos;s a lot of issu@@ es ."
"I mean global war@@ ming cer@@ tain@@ ly is a mas@@ sive thre@@ at to man@@ kind and we are pu@@ tting a lot of time and energy into , A , trying to come up with alter@@ n@@ ative fu@@ els and , B , you know , we just la@@ un@@ ched this pri@@ ze , which is really a pri@@ ze in case we don &apos;t get an answer on alter@@ n@@ ative fu@@ els , in case we don &apos;t actually man@@ age to get the car@@ b@@ on e@@ mis@@ sions cut down quickly , and in case we go through the ti@@ pping point ."
We need to try to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge people to come up with a way of ex@@ trac@@ ting car@@ b@@ on out of the Earth &apos;s atmo@@ sp@@ here .
"And we just — you know , there wer@@ en &apos;t really people working on that before , so we wanted people to try to — all the best bra@@ ins in the world to start thinking about that , and also to try to ex@@ trac@@ t the meth@@ ane out of the Earth &apos;s atmo@@ sp@@ here as well ."
"And actually , we &apos;ve had about 1@@ 5@@ ,000 people fi@@ ll in the form@@ s saying they want to give it a go ."
"And so we only need one , so we &apos;re hop@@ e@@ ful ."
CA : And you &apos;re also working in Africa on a couple of proje@@ cts ?
"R@@ B : Yes , I mean , we &apos;ve got — we &apos;re se@@ tting up something called the war room , which is maybe the wrong word ."
"We &apos;re trying to — maybe we &apos;ll change it — but any@@ way , it &apos;s a war room to try to co@@ ordin@@ ate all the att@@ ack that &apos;s going on in Africa , all the different social problems in Africa , and try to look at best prac@@ ti@@ ces ."
"So , for in@@ stance , there &apos;s a do@@ ctor in Africa that &apos;s found that if you give a mother anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral dru@@ gs at 2@@ 4 weeks , when she &apos;s pre@@ gn@@ ant , that the b@@ aby will not have HIV when it &apos;s born ."
And so dis@@ se@@ min@@ ating that information to around the rest of Africa is important .
"CA : The war room sounds , it sounds powerful and dra@@ m@@ atic ."
"And is there a ri@@ sk that the kind of the business her@@ o@@ es of the W@@ est get so exci@@ ted about — I mean , they &apos;re used to having an idea , getting stuff done , and they believe prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly in their ability to make a difference in the world ."
"I@@ s there a ri@@ sk that we go to places like Africa and say , we &apos;ve got to fi@@ x this problem and we can do it , I &apos;ve got all these bi@@ llions of dollars , you know , da , da , da — here &apos;s the big idea . And kind of take a much more comple@@ x situ@@ ation and actually end up making a m@@ ess of it . Do you wor@@ ry about that ?"
"R@@ B : Well , first of all , on this particular situ@@ ation , we &apos;re actually — we &apos;re working with the government on it ."
"I mean , T@@ ha@@ bo M@@ be@@ ki &apos;s had his problems with ac@@ cep@@ ting HIV and AIDS are re@@ lated , but this is a way , I think , of him t@@ ac@@ k@@ ling this problem and instead of the world cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ing him , it &apos;s a way of working with him , with his government ."
"It &apos;s important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help , they don &apos;t just go in there and then leave after a few years ."
It &apos;s got to be consi@@ st@@ ent .
But I think business le@@ ad@@ ers can bring their ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ u@@ ri@@ al know@@ -@@ how and help govern@@ ments appro@@ ach things sli@@ gh@@ tly differ@@ ently .
"For in@@ stance , we &apos;re se@@ tting up c@@ lini@@ cs in Africa where we &apos;re going to be gi@@ ving f@@ ree anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral dru@@ gs , f@@ ree T@@ B tre@@ at@@ ment and f@@ ree mal@@ ar@@ ia tre@@ at@@ ment ."
"But we &apos;re also trying to make them self-@@ susta@@ ining c@@ lini@@ cs , so that people pay for some other aspe@@ cts ."
"CA : I mean a lot of cy@@ ni@@ cs say about someone like yourself , or Bi@@ ll G@@ ates , or whatever , that this is really being — it &apos;s almost dri@@ ven by some sort of de@@ si@@ re again , you know , for the right image , for gu@@ il@@ t av@@ o@@ i@@ dance and not like a real ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pi@@ c in@@ st@@ in@@ ct ."
What would you say to them ?
"R@@ B : Well , I think that everybody — people do things for a whole v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of different reas@@ ons and I think that , you know , when I &apos;m on me de@@ a@@ th@@ bed , I will want to feel that I &apos;ve made a difference to other people &apos;s lives ."
"And that may be a sel@@ fish thing to think , but it &apos;s the way I &apos;ve been brought up ."
"I think if I &apos;m in a posi@@ tion to radi@@ cally change other people &apos;s lives for the better , I should do so ."
CA : How old are you ?
R@@ B : I &apos;m 5@@ 6 .
"CA : I mean , the psycho@@ logi@@ st E@@ ri@@ k E@@ ri@@ k@@ son says that — as I understand him and I &apos;m a tot@@ al am@@ ate@@ ur — but that during 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s people are dri@@ ven by this de@@ si@@ re to gro@@ w and that &apos;s where they get their fu@@ l@@ fil@@ l@@ ment ."
"@@ 5@@ 0s , 6@@ 0s , the mo@@ de of oper@@ ation shi@@ f@@ ts more to the qu@@ est for wi@@ s@@ dom and a sear@@ ch for leg@@ acy ."
"I mean , it seem@@ s like you &apos;re still a little bit in the grow@@ th p@@ ha@@ ses , you &apos;re still doing these incredible new pl@@ ans ."
"H@@ ow much do you think about leg@@ acy , and what would you like your leg@@ acy to be ?"
R@@ B : I don &apos;t think I think too much about leg@@ acy .
"I mean , I like to — you know , my grand@@ mother li@@ ved to 10@@ 1 , so hop@@ e@@ fully I &apos;ve got another 30 or 40 years to go ."
"No , I just want to live life to its full ."
"You know , if I can make a difference , I hope to be able to make a difference ."
"And I think one of the posi@@ tive things at the moment is you &apos;ve got S@@ er@@ g@@ ey and L@@ ar@@ ry from Go@@ og@@ le , for in@@ stance , who are good friends ."
"And , th@@ ank God , you &apos;ve got two people who gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely care about the world and with that kind of we@@ alth ."
"If they had that kind of we@@ alth and they didn &apos;t care about the world , it would be very wor@@ ry@@ ing ."
And you know they &apos;re going to make a he@@ ll of a difference to the world .
And I think it &apos;s important that people in that kind of posi@@ tion do make a difference .
"CA : Well , Ri@@ ch@@ ard , when I was star@@ ting off in business , I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of — I thought that business people were sup@@ posed to just be ru@@ th@@ less and that that was the only way you could have a ch@@ ance of suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ding ."
"And you actually did inspi@@ re me . I looked at you , I thought , well , he &apos;s made it . Ma@@ ybe there is a different way ."
"So I would like to th@@ ank you for that in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation , and for coming to TED today . Thank you ."
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
"So it was about four years ago , five years ago , I was sitting on a st@@ age in P@@ h@@ il@@ a@@ de@@ l@@ phi@@ a , I think it was , with a ba@@ g si@@ mi@@ lar to this ."
And I was pul@@ ling a mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le out of this ba@@ g .
"And I was saying , you don &apos;t know this mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le really well , but your body know@@ s it extre@@ me@@ ly well ."
"And I was thinking that your body h@@ ated it , at the time , because we are very im@@ mu@@ ne to this . This is called al@@ p@@ ha@@ -@@ g@@ al epi@@ top@@ e ."
And the fact that pi@@ g heart val@@ ves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can &apos;t tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant a pi@@ g heart val@@ ve into a person e@@ a@@ si@@ ly .
A@@ c@@ tually our body doesn &apos;t h@@ ate these .
O@@ ur body lo@@ ves these . It e@@ ats them .
"I mean , the cells in our im@@ mu@@ ne system are always hun@@ g@@ ry ."
"And if an anti@@ body is stu@@ ck to one of these things on the cell , it means &quot; &quot; that &apos;s food . &quot; &quot; Now , I was thinking about that and I said , you know , we &apos;ve got this im@@ mu@@ ne respon@@ se to this ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le that we don &apos;t make , and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff ."
"But I said we can &apos;t get ri@@ d of it , because all the people who tr@@ ied to tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant heart val@@ ves found out you can &apos;t get ri@@ d of that im@@ muni@@ ty ."
"And I said , why don &apos;t you use that ?"
"What if I could sti@@ ck this mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le , s@@ la@@ p it on@@ to a bac@@ ter@@ ia that was pa@@ th@@ og@@ eni@@ c to me , that had just inv@@ ad@@ ed my lu@@ n@@ gs ?"
"I mean I could im@@ medi@@ ately ta@@ p into an im@@ mu@@ ne respon@@ se that was already there , where it was not going to take five or six days to develo@@ p it — it was going to im@@ medi@@ ately att@@ ack whatever this thing was on ."
"It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you , like when you &apos;re getting stop@@ ped for a traf@@ fic ti@@ ck@@ et in L@@ .@@ A@@ . , and the co@@ p dro@@ ps a ba@@ g of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana in the back of your car , and then char@@ ges you for pos@@ s@@ es@@ sion of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana ."
"It &apos;s like this very f@@ ast , very ef@@ fi@@ cient way to get people off the stre@@ et ."
"( Laughter ) So you can take a bac@@ ter@@ ia that really doesn &apos;t make these things at all , and if you could cl@@ am@@ p these on it really well you have it taken off the stre@@ et ."
And for certain bac@@ ter@@ ia we don &apos;t have really ef@@ fi@@ cient ways to do that any@@ more .
O@@ ur anti@@ bi@@ oti@@ cs are ru@@ n@@ ning out .
"And , I mean , the world ap@@ par@@ ently is ru@@ n@@ ning out too ."
So probably it doesn &apos;t matter 50 years from now — stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ cus and stuff like that will be ra@@ m@@ p@@ ant — because we won &apos;t be here . But if we are — ( Laughter ) we &apos;re going to need something to do with the bac@@ ter@@ ia .
"So I started working with this thing , with a bu@@ n@@ ch of col@@ labor@@ at@@ ors ."
"And trying to att@@ ach this to things that were themselves att@@ ach@@ ed to certain speci@@ fic tar@@ get z@@ ones , bac@@ ter@@ ia that we don &apos;t like ."
And I feel now like G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h .
"It &apos;s like &quot; &quot; mis@@ sion ac@@ comp@@ li@@ shed . &quot; &quot; So I might be doing something du@@ m@@ b , just like he was doing at the time ."
But basically what I was talking about there we &apos;ve now got@@ ten to work .
And it &apos;s kil@@ ling bac@@ ter@@ ia . It &apos;s e@@ ating them .
"This thing can be stu@@ ck , like that little green tri@@ ang@@ le up there , sort of sym@@ bo@@ liz@@ ing this right now ."
You can sti@@ ck this to something called a DNA ap@@ tam@@ er .
And that DNA ap@@ tam@@ er will att@@ ach speci@@ fi@@ cally to a tar@@ get that you have se@@ le@@ cted for it .
"So you can find a little fe@@ ature on a bac@@ ter@@ i@@ um that you don &apos;t like , like S@@ ta@@ ph@@ y@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus — I don &apos;t like it in particular , because it kil@@ led a prof@@ ess@@ or friend of m@@ ine last year ."
It doesn &apos;t re@@ spo@@ nd to anti@@ bi@@ oti@@ cs . So I don &apos;t like it .
And I &apos;m making an ap@@ tam@@ er that will have this att@@ ach@@ ed to it .
"That will know how to find S@@ ta@@ ph when it &apos;s in your body , and will al@@ er@@ t your im@@ mu@@ ne system to go after it ."
Here &apos;s what happened . Se@@ e that line on the very top with the little d@@ ots ?
"That &apos;s a bu@@ n@@ ch of mi@@ ce that had been po@@ is@@ on@@ ed by our scienti@@ st friends down in T@@ ex@@ as , at B@@ ro@@ o@@ ks A@@ ir B@@ ase , with an@@ th@@ ra@@ x ."
"And they had also been tre@@ ated with a dru@@ g that we made that would att@@ ack an@@ th@@ ra@@ x in particular , and dire@@ ct your im@@ mu@@ ne system to it ."
"You &apos;ll noti@@ ce they all li@@ ved , the ones on the top line — that &apos;s a 100 percent survi@@ v@@ al r@@ ate ."
"And they actually li@@ ved another 14 days , or 2@@ 8 when we finally kil@@ led them , and took them a@@ part and figu@@ red out what went wrong ."
Why did they not die ?
And they didn &apos;t die because they didn &apos;t have an@@ th@@ ra@@ x any@@ more .
So we did it . O@@ kay ?

"And I found myself , after two years there and perform@@ ing and lear@@ ning , on the is@@ land of B@@ ali , on the ed@@ ge of a c@@ rat@@ er , G@@ un@@ ung B@@ at@@ ur ."
"And I was in a vi@@ ll@@ age where there was an ini@@ ti@@ ation cer@@ em@@ ony for the young men , a ri@@ te of pas@@ s@@ age ."

"And as I s@@ at in this tem@@ ple squ@@ are under this gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic ber@@ ing@@ in b@@ any@@ an t@@ ree , in the dar@@ k , there was no electri@@ city , just the full mo@@ on , down in this em@@ p@@ ty squ@@ are , and I heard the most beautiful sounds , like a Ch@@ ar@@ les I@@ ves con@@ cer@@ t as I list@@ en@@ ed to the g@@ am@@ el@@ an music from all the different vi@@ ll@@ ag@@ ers that came for this on@@ ce@@ -@@ every@@ -@@ fi@@ ve@@ -@@ years cer@@ em@@ ony ."
And I thought I was alone in the dar@@ k under this t@@ ree .
"And all of a sud@@ den , out of the dar@@ k , from the other end of the squ@@ are , I saw the gl@@ int of mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r@@ s li@@ t by the mo@@ on ."

"But some@@ how , it didn &apos;t matter about the publi@@ city ."
There was no money inv@@ olved .
It wasn &apos;t going to be wri@@ t@@ ten down . It was no news .
And there were these incredible arti@@ sts that felt for me like an e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty as they perform@@ ed .

The vi@@ ll@@ age squ@@ are was fil@@ led with hundre@@ ds of people .

They needed the light to see .

"It &apos;s a movie . I did &quot; &quot; The T@@ em@@ p@@ est &quot; &quot; on a st@@ age three times in the the@@ ater since 19@@ 8@@ 4 , &apos; 8@@ 6 , and I love the play ."
I did it always with a m@@ ale Pro@@ sp@@ er@@ o .

Why not H@@ ele@@ n M@@ ir@@ re@@ n ? She &apos;s a great ac@@ tor . Why not ? &quot; &quot; And this materi@@ al really did work for a woman equ@@ ally as well .

"( Applause ) So I went from the@@ ater , doing &quot; &quot; The T@@ em@@ p@@ est &quot; &quot; on the st@@ age in a very low@@ -@@ bud@@ get produ@@ ction many years ago , and I love the play , and I also think it &apos;s S@@ ha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are &apos;s last play , and it really len@@ ds itself , as you can see , to cin@@ em@@ a ."
"The ide@@ ogra@@ ph that I tal@@ ked to you about before , what is it for &quot; &quot; The T@@ em@@ p@@ est &quot; &quot; ?"
"What , if I were to bo@@ il it down , would be the one image that I could h@@ an@@ g my h@@ at on for this ?"
"And it was the s@@ and ca@@ st@@ le , the idea of n@@ ur@@ ture ver@@ su@@ s nature , that we build these ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations — she spe@@ ak@@ s about it at the end , H@@ ele@@ n M@@ ir@@ re@@ n &apos;s Pro@@ sp@@ era — we build them , but under nature , under the gr@@ and tem@@ p@@ est , these cl@@ ou@@ d-@@ ca@@ pped tow@@ ers , these gor@@ ge@@ ous pal@@ ac@@ es will f@@ ade and there will — leave not a rac@@ k behind ."
"So in the the@@ ater , I started the play , it was a black s@@ and ra@@ ke , white cy@@ c , and there was a little girl , Mi@@ ran@@ da , on the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on , building a dri@@ p ca@@ st@@ le , a s@@ and ca@@ st@@ le ."
"And as she was there on the ed@@ ge of that st@@ age , two st@@ ag@@ e@@ h@@ ands all in black with wat@@ ering cans ran along the top and started to po@@ ur water on the s@@ and ca@@ st@@ le , and the s@@ and ca@@ st@@ le started to dri@@ p and sin@@ k , but before it did , the audience saw the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ cl@@ ad st@@ ag@@ e@@ h@@ ands ."
The medi@@ um was ap@@ par@@ ent . It was ban@@ al . We saw it .
"But as they started to po@@ ur the water , the light changed from show@@ ing you the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ cl@@ ad st@@ ag@@ e@@ h@@ ands to fo@@ c@@ using , this rou@@ gh mag@@ ic that we do in the@@ ater , it fo@@ c@@ used right on the water itself ."
"And all of a sud@@ den , the audience &apos;s perspe@@ ctive chang@@ es ."

"The mas@@ ked ac@@ t@@ ors , the pu@@ p@@ pe@@ te@@ ers , they disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar , and the audience makes that lea@@ p into this world , into this imag@@ in@@ ary world of &quot; &quot; The T@@ em@@ p@@ est &quot; &quot; actually happening ."
"Now the difference when I went and did it in the cin@@ em@@ a , I started the ac@@ tu@@ al movie with a clo@@ se@@ -@@ up of a s@@ and ca@@ st@@ le , a black s@@ and ca@@ st@@ le , and what cin@@ em@@ a can do is , by using cam@@ era , perspe@@ ctive , and also long sh@@ ots and clo@@ se@@ -@@ u@@ ps , it started on a clo@@ se@@ -@@ up of the s@@ and ca@@ st@@ le , and as it pul@@ led away , you saw that it was a min@@ i@@ ature sitting in the pal@@ m of the girl &apos;s h@@ ands ."

Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m a neuro@@ scienti@@ st .
"And in neuro@@ science , we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain ."
"But I want to start with the e@@ as@@ ie@@ st question and the question you really should have all asked your@@ selves at some point in your life , because it &apos;s a fundam@@ ent@@ al question if we want to understand brain fun@@ ction ."
"And that is , why do we and other animals have bra@@ ins ?"
"N@@ ot all species on our planet have bra@@ ins , so if we want to know what the brain is for , let &apos;s think about why we ev@@ olved one ."
"Now you may reason that we have one to per@@ cei@@ ve the world or to think , and that &apos;s completely wrong ."
"If you think about this question for any len@@ g@@ th of time , it &apos;s b@@ lin@@ d@@ ing@@ ly obvi@@ ous why we have a brain ."
"We have a brain for one reason and one reason only , and that &apos;s to produ@@ ce ad@@ ap@@ table and comple@@ x mov@@ em@@ ents ."
There is no other reason to have a brain .
Th@@ in@@ k about it .
Mo@@ v@@ ement is the only way you have of af@@ fe@@ cting the world around you .
"Now that &apos;s not quite true . There &apos;s one other way , and that &apos;s through s@@ we@@ ating ."
"But a@@ part from that , everything else goes through con@@ trac@@ tions of mus@@ cles ."
"So think about communi@@ cation — spe@@ e@@ ch , g@@ est@@ ures , writing , sig@@ n language — they &apos;re all medi@@ ated through con@@ trac@@ tions of your mus@@ cles ."
"So it &apos;s really important to remember that sen@@ sor@@ y , memor@@ y and cogni@@ tive pro@@ cess@@ es are all important , but they &apos;re only important to either dri@@ ve or sup@@ pre@@ ss future mov@@ em@@ ents ."
There can be no ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary adv@@ an@@ t@@ age to la@@ ying down memor@@ ies of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od or per@@ cei@@ ving the color of a ro@@ se if it doesn &apos;t af@@ fe@@ ct the way you &apos;re going to move later in life .
"Now for those who don &apos;t believe this ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent , we have tre@@ es and gra@@ ss on our planet without the brain , but the c@@ lin@@ ching evi@@ dence is this ani@@ mal here — the hum@@ ble se@@ a squ@@ ir@@ t ."
"R@@ u@@ di@@ ment@@ ary ani@@ mal , has a ner@@ v@@ ous system , s@@ wi@@ ms around in the ocean in its ju@@ v@@ eni@@ le life ."
"And at some point of its life , it im@@ plan@@ ts on a ro@@ ck ."
"And the first thing it does in im@@ plan@@ ting on that ro@@ ck , which it never lea@@ ves , is to di@@ gest its own brain and ner@@ v@@ ous system for food ."
"So once you don &apos;t need to move , you don &apos;t need the lu@@ x@@ ury of that brain ."
"And this ani@@ mal is often taken as an an@@ al@@ og@@ y to what happens at uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties when prof@@ es@@ sor@@ s get ten@@ ure , but that &apos;s a different sub@@ je@@ ct ."
( Applause ) So I am a movement ch@@ au@@ v@@ ini@@ st .
I believe movement is the most important fun@@ ction of the brain — don &apos;t let any@@ one tell you that it &apos;s not true .
"Now if movement is so important , how well are we doing under@@ standing how the brain contro@@ ls movement ?"
And the answer is we &apos;re doing extre@@ me@@ ly po@@ or@@ ly ; it &apos;s a very hard problem .
But we can look at how well we &apos;re doing by thinking about how well we &apos;re doing building mach@@ ines which can do what hum@@ ans can do .
Th@@ in@@ k about the g@@ ame of ch@@ ess .
How well are we doing de@@ ter@@ min@@ ing what piece to move where ?
"If you p@@ it G@@ ar@@ ry K@@ as@@ pa@@ ro@@ v here , when he &apos;s not in ja@@ il , against I@@ B@@ M &apos;s De@@ ep B@@ lu@@ e , well the answer is I@@ B@@ M &apos;s De@@ ep B@@ lu@@ e will oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally wi@@ n ."
"And I think if I@@ B@@ M &apos;s De@@ ep B@@ lu@@ e pla@@ yed any@@ one in this room , it would wi@@ n every time ."
That problem is sol@@ ved .
"What about the problem of pi@@ c@@ king up a ch@@ ess piece , de@@ x@@ ter@@ ously m@@ ani@@ pu@@ lat@@ ing it and pu@@ tting it back down on the bo@@ ard ?"
"If you put a five year@@ -@@ old child &apos;s de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity against the best rob@@ ots of today , the answer is simple : the child win@@ s e@@ a@@ si@@ ly ."
There &apos;s no compe@@ ti@@ tion at all .
Now why is that top problem so e@@ asy and the bot@@ tom problem so hard ?
One reason is a very s@@ mar@@ t five year@@ -@@ old could tell you the al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m for that top problem — look at all possible mo@@ ves to the end of the g@@ ame and cho@@ ose the one that makes you wi@@ n .
So it &apos;s a very simple al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m .
"Now of course there are other mo@@ ves , but with v@@ ast compu@@ ters we appro@@ x@@ im@@ ate and come close to the op@@ ti@@ mal solution ."
"When it comes to being de@@ x@@ ter@@ ous , it &apos;s not even clear what the al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m is you have to sol@@ ve to be de@@ x@@ ter@@ ous ."
"And we &apos;ll see you have to both per@@ cei@@ ve and act on the world , which has a lot of problems ."
But let me show you cu@@ t@@ t@@ ing@@ -@@ ed@@ ge rob@@ oti@@ cs .
"Now a lot of rob@@ oti@@ cs is very im@@ pres@@ sive , but m@@ ani@@ pul@@ ation rob@@ oti@@ cs is really just in the dar@@ k ages ."
So this is the end of a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . project from one of the best rob@@ oti@@ cs institu@@ tes .
And the stud@@ ent has tra@@ ined this robot to po@@ ur this water into a gl@@ as@@ s .
"It &apos;s a hard problem because the water s@@ lo@@ sh@@ es about , but it can do it ."
But it doesn &apos;t do it with anything like the ag@@ i@@ lity of a human .
"Now if you want this robot to do a different t@@ ask , that &apos;s another thre@@ e-@@ year P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . program ."
There is no gener@@ aliz@@ ation at all from one t@@ ask to another in rob@@ oti@@ cs .
Now we can comp@@ are this to cu@@ t@@ t@@ ing@@ -@@ ed@@ ge human perform@@ ance .
So what I &apos;m going to show you is E@@ mi@@ ly F@@ o@@ x win@@ ning the world recor@@ d for cu@@ p st@@ ac@@ king .
Now the Ameri@@ cans in the audience will know all about cu@@ p st@@ ac@@ king .
It &apos;s a high school spor@@ t where you have 12 cu@@ ps you have to st@@ ack and un@@ st@@ ack against the clo@@ ck in a pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed order .
And this is her getting the world recor@@ d in real time .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And she &apos;s pretty happy .
"We have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that , and that &apos;s what we &apos;d like to know ."
"So in my group , what we try to do is re@@ verse engine@@ er how hum@@ ans control movement ."
And it sounds like an e@@ asy problem .
"You sen@@ d a comm@@ and down , it ca@@ uses mus@@ cles to con@@ trac@@ t ."
"@@ Y@@ our ar@@ m or body mo@@ ves , and you get sen@@ sor@@ y fe@@ ed@@ back from vision , from sk@@ in , from mus@@ cles and so on ."
The t@@ rou@@ ble is these sig@@ n@@ als are not the beautiful sig@@ n@@ als you want them to be .
"So one thing that makes contro@@ l@@ ling movement difficult is , for example , sen@@ sor@@ y fe@@ ed@@ back is extre@@ me@@ ly no@@ is@@ y ."
"Now by no@@ ise , I do not mean sound ."
We use it in the engine@@ ering and neuro@@ science sense me@@ an@@ ing a ran@@ dom no@@ ise cor@@ ru@@ p@@ ting a sig@@ na@@ l .
"So the old days before di@@ gi@@ tal radi@@ o when you were tu@@ ning in your radi@@ o and you heard &quot; &quot; c@@ r@@ r@@ c@@ ck@@ k@@ k &quot; &quot; on the st@@ ation you wanted to hear , that was the no@@ ise ."
"But more gener@@ ally , this no@@ ise is something that cor@@ ru@@ p@@ ts the sig@@ na@@ l ."
"So for example , if you put your hand under a table and try to lo@@ c@@ ali@@ ze it with your other hand , you can be off by se@@ ver@@ al cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ters du@@ e to the no@@ ise in sen@@ sor@@ y fe@@ ed@@ back ."
"S@@ imi@@ lar@@ ly , when you put mot@@ or out@@ put on movement out@@ put , it &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly no@@ is@@ y ."
"F@@ or@@ get about trying to h@@ it the bu@@ ll &apos;s ey@@ e in dar@@ ts , just a@@ im for the same spo@@ t over and over again ."
You have a huge sp@@ read du@@ e to movement v@@ ari@@ ability .
"And more than that , the outside world , or t@@ ask , is both am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ous and v@@ ari@@ able ."
"The te@@ apo@@ t could be full , it could be em@@ p@@ ty ."
It chang@@ es over time .
So we work in a whole sen@@ sor@@ y movement t@@ ask s@@ ou@@ p of no@@ ise .
Now this no@@ ise is so great that society places a huge pre@@ mi@@ um on those of us who can redu@@ ce the con@@ sequ@@ ences of no@@ ise .
"So if you &apos;re lu@@ ck@@ y enough to be able to k@@ no@@ ck a small white ball into a ho@@ le se@@ ver@@ al hundre@@ d y@@ ar@@ ds away using a long me@@ tal sti@@ ck , our society will be wil@@ ling to re@@ ward you with hundre@@ ds of mi@@ llions of dollars ."
Now what I want to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you of is the brain also goes through a lot of ef@@ for@@ t to redu@@ ce the neg@@ ative con@@ sequ@@ ences of this sort of no@@ ise and v@@ ari@@ ability .
"And to do that , I &apos;m going to tell you about a fra@@ me@@ work which is very popul@@ ar in st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs and mach@@ ine lear@@ ning of the last 50 years called B@@ a@@ ye@@ si@@ an deci@@ sion the@@ ory ."
And it &apos;s more re@@ cent@@ ly a uni@@ f@@ ying way to think about how the brain de@@ als with un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
And the fundam@@ ent@@ al idea is you want to make in@@ fer@@ ences and then take ac@@ tions .
So let &apos;s think about the in@@ fer@@ ence .
You want to gener@@ ate belie@@ f@@ s about the world .
So what are belie@@ f@@ s ?
B@@ el@@ ie@@ f@@ s could be : where are my ar@@ ms in space ?
A@@ m I looking at a c@@ at or a fo@@ x ?
But we &apos;re going to re@@ present belie@@ f@@ s with prob@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies .
"So we &apos;re going to re@@ present a belie@@ f with a number between zer@@ o and one — zer@@ o me@@ an@@ ing I don &apos;t believe it at all , one means I &apos;m absolu@@ tely certain ."
And num@@ bers in between give you the gra@@ y le@@ v@@ els of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
And the key idea to B@@ a@@ ye@@ si@@ an in@@ fer@@ ence is you have two sources of information from which to make your in@@ fer@@ ence .
"You have data , and data in neuro@@ science is sen@@ sor@@ y in@@ put ."
"So I have sen@@ sor@@ y in@@ put , which I can take in to make belie@@ f@@ s ."
"But there &apos;s another source of information , and that &apos;s effe@@ cti@@ vely pri@@ or know@@ le@@ dge ."
You ac@@ cu@@ mul@@ ate know@@ le@@ dge throu@@ gh@@ out your life in memor@@ ies .
And the point about B@@ a@@ ye@@ si@@ an deci@@ sion the@@ ory is it gi@@ ves you the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs of the op@@ ti@@ mal way to com@@ b@@ ine your pri@@ or know@@ le@@ dge with your sen@@ sor@@ y evi@@ dence to gener@@ ate new belie@@ f@@ s .
And I &apos;ve put the for@@ mu@@ la up there .
"I &apos;m not going to expla@@ in what that for@@ mu@@ la is , but it &apos;s very beautiful ."
And it has real beau@@ ty and real ex@@ plan@@ at@@ ory power .
"And what it really says , and what you want to est@@ im@@ ate , is the prob@@ ability of different belie@@ f@@ s given your sen@@ sor@@ y in@@ put ."
So let me give you an in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive example .
I@@ mag@@ ine you &apos;re lear@@ ning to play ten@@ n@@ is and you want to deci@@ de where the ball is going to b@@ oun@@ ce as it comes over the net towar@@ ds you .
There are two sources of information B@@ a@@ y@@ es &apos; ru@@ le tel@@ ls you .
"There &apos;s sen@@ sor@@ y evi@@ dence — you can use vi@@ su@@ al information au@@ di@@ t@@ ory information , and that might tell you it &apos;s going to land in that red spo@@ t ."
"But you know that your sen@@ ses are not perfe@@ ct , and ther@@ e@@ fore there &apos;s some v@@ ari@@ ability of where it &apos;s going to land sh@@ own by that cl@@ ou@@ d of red , re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing num@@ bers between 0@@ .@@ 5 and maybe 0@@ .@@ 1 ."
"That information is available in the cur@@ r@@ ent sh@@ ot , but there &apos;s another source of information not available on the cur@@ r@@ ent sh@@ ot , but only available by re@@ pe@@ ated experience in the g@@ ame of ten@@ n@@ is , and that &apos;s that the ball doesn &apos;t b@@ oun@@ ce with equ@@ al prob@@ ability over the cour@@ t during the mat@@ ch ."
"If you &apos;re playing against a very good op@@ pon@@ ent , they may di@@ stri@@ bu@@ te it in that green area , which is the pri@@ or di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion , making it hard for you to re@@ turn ."
Now both these sources of information car@@ ry important information .
"And what B@@ a@@ y@@ es &apos; ru@@ le says is that I should mul@@ ti@@ ply the num@@ bers on the red by the num@@ bers on the green to get the num@@ bers of the y@@ el@@ low , which have the el@@ li@@ p@@ ses , and that &apos;s my belie@@ f ."
So it &apos;s the op@@ ti@@ mal way of com@@ b@@ ining information .
"Now I wouldn &apos;t tell you all this if it wasn &apos;t that a few years ago , we show@@ ed this is exactly what people do when they learn new movement sk@@ il@@ ls ."
And what it means is we really are B@@ a@@ ye@@ si@@ an in@@ fer@@ ence mach@@ ines .
"As we go around , we learn about st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs of the world and l@@ ay that down , but we also learn about how no@@ is@@ y our own sen@@ sor@@ y ap@@ par@@ at@@ us is , and then com@@ b@@ ine those in a real B@@ a@@ ye@@ si@@ an way ."
Now a key part to the B@@ a@@ ye@@ si@@ an is this part of the for@@ mu@@ la .
And what this part really says is I have to pre@@ di@@ ct the prob@@ ability of different sen@@ sor@@ y fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ ks given my belie@@ f@@ s .
So that really means I have to make pre@@ di@@ ctions of the future .
And I want to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you the brain does make pre@@ di@@ ctions of the sen@@ sor@@ y fe@@ ed@@ back it &apos;s going to get .
"And mo@@ re@@ over , it prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly chang@@ es your per@@ cep@@ tions by what you do ."
"And to do that , I &apos;ll tell you about how the brain de@@ als with sen@@ sor@@ y in@@ put ."
"So you sen@@ d a comm@@ and out , you get sen@@ sor@@ y fe@@ ed@@ back back , and that trans@@ form@@ ation is gover@@ ned by the physi@@ cs of your body and your sen@@ sor@@ y ap@@ par@@ at@@ us ."
But you can imagine looking inside the brain .
And here &apos;s inside the brain .
"You might have a little pre@@ di@@ ctor , a neu@@ ral si@@ mu@@ lat@@ or , of the physi@@ cs of your body and your sen@@ ses ."
"So as you sen@@ d a movement comm@@ and down , you ta@@ p a cop@@ y of that off and run it into your neu@@ ral si@@ mu@@ lat@@ or to anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate the sen@@ sor@@ y con@@ sequ@@ ences of your ac@@ tions ."
"So as I sha@@ ke this ke@@ t@@ ch@@ up bot@@ tle , I get some true sen@@ sor@@ y fe@@ ed@@ back as the fun@@ ction of time in the bot@@ tom row ."
"And if I &apos;ve got a good pre@@ di@@ ctor , it pre@@ di@@ cts the same thing ."
Well why would I bo@@ ther doing that ?
I &apos;m going to get the same fe@@ ed@@ back any@@ way .
Well there &apos;s good reas@@ ons .
"I@@ mag@@ ine , as I sha@@ ke the ke@@ t@@ ch@@ up bot@@ tle , someone very kin@@ d@@ ly comes up to me and ta@@ ps it on the back for me ."
Now I get an ex@@ tra source of sen@@ sor@@ y information du@@ e to that ex@@ ter@@ na@@ l act .
So I get two sources .
"I get you ta@@ pping on it , and I get me sha@@ king it , but from my sen@@ ses &apos; point of view , that is com@@ b@@ ined together into one source of information ."
Now there &apos;s good reason to believe that you would want to be able to di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ h ex@@ ter@@ na@@ l ev@@ ents from inter@@ na@@ l ev@@ ents .
Because ex@@ ter@@ na@@ l ev@@ ents are actually much more behavi@@ or@@ ally rele@@ v@@ ant than feeling everything that &apos;s going on inside my body .
So one way to re@@ con@@ stru@@ ct that is to comp@@ are the pre@@ di@@ ction — which is only based on your movement com@@ man@@ ds — with the re@@ ality .
A@@ ny di@@ scre@@ pan@@ cy should hop@@ e@@ fully be ex@@ ter@@ na@@ l .
"So as I go around the world , I &apos;m making pre@@ di@@ ctions of what I should get , sub@@ trac@@ ting them off ."
E@@ very@@ thing left over is ex@@ ter@@ na@@ l to me .
What evi@@ dence is there for this ?
Well there &apos;s one very clear example where a sen@@ s@@ ation gener@@ ated by myself feel@@ s very different then if gener@@ ated by another person .
And so we decided the most obvi@@ ous place to start was with ti@@ ck@@ ling .
"It &apos;s been known for a long time , you can &apos;t ti@@ ck@@ le yourself as well as other people can ."
"But it ha@@ sn &apos;t really been sh@@ own , it &apos;s because you have a neu@@ ral si@@ mu@@ lat@@ or , si@@ mu@@ lat@@ ing your own body and sub@@ trac@@ ting off that sense ."
So we can bring the experim@@ ents of the 2@@ 1@@ st century by ap@@ pl@@ ying rob@@ oti@@ c technolog@@ ies to this problem .
"And in effe@@ ct , what we have is some sort of sti@@ ck in one hand att@@ ach@@ ed to a robot , and they &apos;re going to move that back and forward ."
"And then we &apos;re going to tr@@ ack that with a computer and use it to control another robot , which is going to ti@@ ck@@ le their pal@@ m with another sti@@ ck ."
And then we &apos;re going to ask them to r@@ ate a bu@@ n@@ ch of things inclu@@ ding ti@@ ck@@ li@@ sh@@ ness .
I &apos;ll show you just one part of our study .
"And here I &apos;ve taken away the rob@@ ots , but basically people move with their right ar@@ m sin@@ us@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ ally back and forward ."
And we re@@ play that to the other hand with a time de@@ l@@ ay .
"E@@ i@@ ther no time de@@ l@@ ay , in which case light would just ti@@ ck@@ le your pal@@ m , or with a time de@@ l@@ ay of two@@ -@@ ten@@ ths of thre@@ e-@@ ten@@ ths of a second ."
So the important point here is the right hand always does the same things — sin@@ us@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ al movement .
The left hand always is the same and pu@@ ts sin@@ us@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ al ti@@ ck@@ le .
All we &apos;re playing with is a tem@@ po ca@@ us@@ ality .
"And as we go from nau@@ ght to 0@@ .@@ 1 second , it be@@ comes more ti@@ ck@@ li@@ sh ."
"As you go from 0@@ .@@ 1 to 0@@ .@@ 2 , it be@@ comes more ti@@ ck@@ li@@ sh at the end ."
"And by 0@@ .@@ 2 of a second , it &apos;s e@@ qui@@ val@@ ently ti@@ ck@@ li@@ sh to the robot that just ti@@ ck@@ led you without you doing anything ."
So whatever is respon@@ si@@ ble for this can@@ cel@@ l@@ ation is extre@@ me@@ ly ti@@ gh@@ tly cou@@ p@@ led with tem@@ po ca@@ us@@ ality .
"And based on this il@@ lu@@ str@@ ation , we really con@@ v@@ in@@ ced ourselves in the fie@@ ld that the brain &apos;s making pre@@ ci@@ se pre@@ di@@ ctions and sub@@ trac@@ ting them off from the sen@@ s@@ ations ."
"Now I have to ad@@ m@@ it , these are the wor@@ st stud@@ ies my la@@ b has ever run ."
"Because the ti@@ ck@@ le sen@@ s@@ ation on the pal@@ m comes and goes , you need large num@@ bers of sub@@ je@@ cts with these star@@ s making them sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant ."
So we were looking for a much more obje@@ ctive way to as@@ s@@ ess this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a .
And in the inter@@ ven@@ ing years I had two d@@ augh@@ ters .
"And one thing you noti@@ ce about children in back@@ se@@ ats of cars on long jour@@ ne@@ ys , they get into fi@@ ghts — which started with one of them doing something to the other , the other re@@ t@@ ali@@ ating ."
It quickly es@@ cal@@ ates .
And children ten@@ d to get into fi@@ ghts which es@@ cal@@ ate in terms of force .
"Now when I scre@@ am@@ ed at my children to stop , sometimes they would both say to me the other person h@@ it them har@@ der ."
"Now I happen to know my children don &apos;t lie , so I thought , as a neuro@@ scienti@@ st , it was important how I could expla@@ in how they were tel@@ ling in@@ consi@@ st@@ ent tru@@ ths ."
"And we hy@@ po@@ the@@ size based on the ti@@ ck@@ ling study that when one child hi@@ ts another , they gener@@ ate the movement comm@@ and ."
They pre@@ di@@ ct the sen@@ sor@@ y con@@ sequ@@ ences and sub@@ trac@@ t it off .
So they actually think they &apos;ve h@@ it the person less hard than they have — rather like the ti@@ ck@@ ling .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the pas@@ sive re@@ ci@@ pie@@ n@@ t doesn &apos;t make the pre@@ di@@ ction , feel@@ s the full b@@ low ."
"So if they re@@ t@@ ali@@ ate with the same force , the first person will think it &apos;s been es@@ cal@@ ated ."
So we decided to test this in the la@@ b .
"( Laughter ) Now we don &apos;t work with children , we don &apos;t work with hi@@ tting , but the con@@ cept is iden@@ tical ."
We bring in two ad@@ ul@@ ts . We tell them they &apos;re going to play a g@@ ame .
And so here &apos;s pla@@ y@@ er one and pla@@ y@@ er two sitting op@@ posi@@ te to each other .
And the g@@ ame is very simple .
"We started with a mot@@ or with a little le@@ ver , a little force trans@@ f@@ us@@ er ."
And we use this mot@@ or to app@@ ly force down to pla@@ y@@ er one &apos;s fin@@ g@@ ers for three secon@@ ds and then it stop@@ s .
"And that pla@@ y@@ er &apos;s been told , remember the experience of that force and use your other fin@@ ger to app@@ ly the same force down to the other sub@@ je@@ ct &apos;s fin@@ ger through a force trans@@ f@@ us@@ er — and they do that ."
"And pla@@ y@@ er two &apos;s been told , remember the experience of that force ."
U@@ se your other hand to app@@ ly the force back down .
And so they take it in turns to app@@ ly the force they &apos;ve just exper@@ ien@@ ced back and forward .
"But cri@@ ti@@ cally , they &apos;re br@@ ie@@ f@@ ed about the ru@@ les of the g@@ ame in se@@ par@@ ate ro@@ oms ."
So they don &apos;t know the ru@@ les the other person &apos;s playing by .
And what we &apos;ve meas@@ u@@ red is the force as a fun@@ ction of terms .
"And if we look at what we start with , a qu@@ ar@@ ter of a N@@ ew@@ ton there , a number of turns , perfe@@ ct would be that red line ."
And what we see in all pa@@ ir@@ s of sub@@ je@@ cts is this — a 70 percent es@@ cal@@ ation in force on each go .
"So it really su@@ gg@@ est@@ s , when you &apos;re doing this — based on this study and others we &apos;ve done — that the brain is can@@ cel@@ ing the sen@@ sor@@ y con@@ sequ@@ ences and under@@ est@@ im@@ ating the force it &apos;s produ@@ cing ."
So it re@@ -@@ shows the brain makes pre@@ di@@ ctions and fundam@@ ent@@ ally chang@@ es the pre@@ cep@@ ts .
"So we &apos;ve made in@@ fer@@ ences , we &apos;ve done pre@@ di@@ ctions , now we have to gener@@ ate ac@@ tions ."
"And what B@@ a@@ y@@ es &apos; ru@@ le says is , given my belie@@ f@@ s , the action should in some sense be op@@ ti@@ mal ."
But we &apos;ve got a problem .
"T@@ as@@ ks are sym@@ bo@@ li@@ c — I want to d@@ r@@ in@@ k , I want to dance — but the movement system has to con@@ trac@@ t 6@@ 00 mus@@ cles in a particular sequ@@ ence ."
And there &apos;s a big ga@@ p between the t@@ ask and the movement system .
So it could be bri@@ d@@ g@@ ed in in@@ fini@@ tely many different ways .
So think about just a point to point movement .
I could cho@@ ose these two pa@@ ths out of an in@@ fini@@ te number of pa@@ ths .
"H@@ a@@ ving cho@@ s@@ en a particular pat@@ h , I can h@@ old my hand on that pat@@ h as in@@ fini@@ tely many different jo@@ int con@@ fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations ."
And I can h@@ old my ar@@ m in a particular jo@@ int con@@ fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation either very sti@@ ff or very re@@ la@@ x@@ ed .
So I have a huge amount of cho@@ ice to make .
"Now it turns out , we are extre@@ me@@ ly ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pi@@ cal ."
We all move the same way pretty much .
"And so it turns out we &apos;re so ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pi@@ cal , our bra@@ ins have got de@@ di@@ c@@ ated neu@@ ral cir@@ cu@@ i@@ try to dec@@ od@@ e this ster@@ e@@ oty@@ ping ."
"So if I take some d@@ ots and set them in moti@@ on with biologi@@ cal moti@@ on , your brain &apos;s cir@@ cu@@ i@@ try would understand in@@ stan@@ tly what &apos;s going on ."
Now this is a bu@@ n@@ ch of d@@ ots moving .
"You will know what this person is doing , whether happy , sa@@ d , old , young — a huge amount of information ."
"If these d@@ ots were cars going on a rac@@ ing cir@@ cu@@ it , you would have absolu@@ tely no idea what &apos;s going on ."
So why is it that we move the particular ways we do ?
Well let &apos;s think about what really happens .
Ma@@ ybe we don &apos;t all quite move the same way .
Ma@@ ybe there &apos;s v@@ ari@@ ation in the popul@@ ation .
And maybe those who move better than others have got more ch@@ ance of getting their children into the next gener@@ ation .
"So in ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary sc@@ al@@ es , mov@@ em@@ ents get better ."
"And per@@ haps in life , mov@@ em@@ ents get better through lear@@ ning ."
So what is it about a movement which is good or bad ?
I@@ mag@@ ine I want to inter@@ cept this ball .
Here are two possible pa@@ ths to that ball .
"Well if I cho@@ ose the le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand pat@@ h , I can work out the for@@ ces requi@@ red in one of my mus@@ cles as a fun@@ ction of time ."
But there &apos;s no@@ ise ad@@ ded to this .
"So what I actually get , based on this lo@@ vely , smo@@ ot@@ h , de@@ si@@ red force , is a very no@@ is@@ y ver@@ sion ."
"So if I pi@@ ck the same comm@@ and through many times , I will get a different no@@ is@@ y ver@@ sion each time , because no@@ ise chang@@ es each time ."
So what I can show you here is how the v@@ ari@@ ability of the movement will ev@@ ol@@ ve if I cho@@ ose that way .
"If I cho@@ ose a different way of moving — on the right for example — then I &apos;ll have a different comm@@ and , different no@@ ise , playing through a no@@ is@@ y system , very comp@@ lic@@ ated ."
All we can be sure of is the v@@ ari@@ ability will be different .
"If I move in this particular way , I end up with a s@@ mal@@ ler v@@ ari@@ ability across many mov@@ em@@ ents ."
"So if I have to cho@@ ose between those two , I would cho@@ ose the right one because it &apos;s less v@@ ari@@ able ."
And the fundam@@ ent@@ al idea is you want to pl@@ an your mov@@ em@@ ents so as to min@@ imi@@ ze the neg@@ ative con@@ sequ@@ ence of the no@@ ise .
And one in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion to get is actually the amount of no@@ ise or v@@ ari@@ ability I show here gets bi@@ g@@ ger as the force gets bi@@ g@@ ger .
So you want to av@@ o@@ id big for@@ ces as one prin@@ ci@@ ple .
"So we &apos;ve sh@@ own that using this , we can expla@@ in a huge amount of data — that exactly people are going about their lives plan@@ ning mov@@ em@@ ents so as to min@@ imi@@ ze neg@@ ative con@@ sequ@@ ences of no@@ ise ."
So I hope I &apos;ve con@@ v@@ in@@ ced you the brain is there and ev@@ olved to control movement .
And it &apos;s an in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al challen@@ ge to understand how we do that .
But it &apos;s also rele@@ v@@ ant for dise@@ ase and re@@ ha@@ bi@@ lit@@ ation .
There are many dise@@ ases which effe@@ ct movement .
"And hop@@ e@@ fully if we understand how we control movement , we can app@@ ly that to rob@@ oti@@ c technology ."
"And finally , I want to re@@ mind you , when you see animals do what look like very simple t@@ as@@ ks , the ac@@ tu@@ al comple@@ x@@ ity of what is going on inside their brain is really quite dra@@ m@@ atic ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Q@@ u@@ i@@ ck question for you , D@@ an ."
So you &apos;re a movement — ( D@@ W : C@@ ha@@ u@@ v@@ ini@@ st . ) — ch@@ au@@ v@@ ini@@ st .
"D@@ o@@ es that mean that you think that the other things we think our bra@@ ins are about — the dre@@ am@@ ing , the year@@ ning , the fal@@ ling in love and all these things — are a kind of side show , an ac@@ ci@@ dent ?"
"D@@ W : No , no , actually I think they &apos;re all important to dri@@ ve the right movement behavi@@ or to get re@@ produ@@ ction in the end ."
So I think people who study sen@@ s@@ ation or memor@@ y without realiz@@ ing why you &apos;re la@@ ying down memor@@ ies of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od .
"The fact that we for@@ get most of our chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od , for example , is probably f@@ ine , because it doesn &apos;t effe@@ ct our mov@@ em@@ ents later in life ."
You only need to stor@@ e things which are really going to effe@@ ct movement .
"CA : So you think that people thinking about the brain , and con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness gener@@ ally , could get real in@@ si@@ ght by saying , where does movement play in this g@@ ame ?"
D@@ W : So people have found out for example that stu@@ dy@@ ing vision in the ab@@ sen@@ ce of realiz@@ ing why you have vision is a mist@@ ake .
You have to study vision with the realiz@@ ation of how the movement system is going to use vision .
And it uses it very differ@@ ently once you think about it that way .
CA : Well that was quite fas@@ cin@@ ating . Thank you very much in@@ de@@ ed .
( Applause )
"So that &apos;s Joh@@ n@@ ny De@@ p@@ p , of course ."
And that &apos;s Joh@@ n@@ ny De@@ p@@ p &apos;s sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der .
And that &apos;s Joh@@ n@@ ny De@@ p@@ p &apos;s fam@@ ous sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der tat@@ too .
"S@@ ome of you might know that , in 199@@ 0 , De@@ p@@ p got eng@@ aged to W@@ in@@ ona R@@ y@@ der , and he had tat@@ to@@ o@@ ed on his right sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der &quot; W@@ in@@ ona fore@@ ver . &quot;"

"I first started thinking about getting it in my mi@@ d-@@ 20@@ s , but I deli@@ ber@@ ately wai@@ ted a really long time ."
Because we all know people who have got@@ ten tat@@ to@@ os when they were 1@@ 7 or 1@@ 9 or 2@@ 3 and re@@ gre@@ t@@ ted it by the time they were 30 .
That didn &apos;t happen to me .
"I got my tat@@ too when I was 2@@ 9 , and I re@@ gre@@ t@@ ted it in@@ stan@@ tly ."
"And by &quot; &quot; re@@ gre@@ t@@ ted it , &quot; &quot; I mean that I ste@@ pped outside of the tat@@ too place — this is just a couple miles from here down on the L@@ ow@@ er E@@ ast S@@ i@@ de — and I had a mas@@ sive emoti@@ onal me@@ l@@ t@@ down in bro@@ ad da@@ y@@ light on the cor@@ ner of E@@ ast B@@ ro@@ ad@@ way and C@@ an@@ al St@@ re@@ et ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich is a great place to do it because no@@ body car@@ es . ( Laughter )
"And then I went home that night , and I had an even lar@@ ger emoti@@ onal me@@ l@@ t@@ down , which I &apos;ll say more about in a minu@@ te ."
"And this was all actually quite sh@@ oc@@ king to me , because pri@@ or to this moment , I had pri@@ ded myself on having absolu@@ tely no re@@ gre@@ ts ."
"I made a lot of mist@@ ak@@ es and du@@ m@@ b deci@@ sions , of course ."
I do that h@@ our@@ ly .
"But I had always felt like , look , you know , I made the best cho@@ ice I could make given who I was then , given the information I had on hand ."
I learned a l@@ es@@ son from it .
It some@@ how got me to where I am in life right now .
"And o@@ kay , I wouldn &apos;t change it ."
"In other words , I had dru@@ n@@ k our great cul@@ tu@@ ral Ko@@ ol@@ -@@ A@@ id about re@@ gre@@ t , which is that l@@ am@@ ent@@ ing things that oc@@ cur@@ red in the past is an absolu@@ te wa@@ ste of time , that we should always look forward and not back@@ ward , and that one of the no@@ bl@@ est and best things we can do is stri@@ ve to live a life f@@ ree of re@@ gre@@ ts ."
This idea is ni@@ ce@@ ly cap@@ tu@@ red by this quot@@ e : &quot; &quot; Th@@ ings without all re@@ me@@ dy should be without re@@ g@@ ard ; what &apos;s done is done . &quot; &quot; And it seem@@ s like kind of an ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ ble phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y at first — something we might all ag@@ ree to sig@@ n on@@ to ...
until I tell you who said it .
"R@@ ight , so this is L@@ ady M@@ ac@@ Be@@ th basically tel@@ ling her h@@ us@@ b@@ and to stop being such a w@@ us@@ s for feeling bad about mu@@ r@@ der@@ ing people ."
"And as it happens , S@@ ha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are was on@@ to something here , as he gener@@ ally was ."
Because the in@@ ability to experience re@@ gre@@ t is actually one of the di@@ ag@@ no@@ stic char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ sti@@ cs of so@@ ci@@ op@@ a@@ ths .
"It &apos;s also , by the way , a char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ stic of certain kinds of brain dam@@ age ."
So people who have dam@@ age to their or@@ bi@@ tal fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x se@@ em to be u@@ na@@ ble to feel re@@ gre@@ t in the face of even obvi@@ ously very po@@ or deci@@ sions .
"So if , in fact , you want to live a life f@@ ree of re@@ gre@@ t , there is an op@@ tion open to you ."
It &apos;s called a lo@@ bot@@ om@@ y .
"But if you want to be fully fun@@ cti@@ onal and fully human and fully hum@@ ane , I think you need to learn to live , not without re@@ gre@@ t , but with it ."
So let &apos;s start off by de@@ fin@@ ing some terms .
What is re@@ gre@@ t ?
Re@@ gre@@ t is the emoti@@ on we experience when we think that our present situ@@ ation could be better or ha@@ p@@ pie@@ r if we had done something different in the past .
"So in other words , re@@ gre@@ t requi@@ res two things ."
"It requi@@ res , first of all , ag@@ en@@ cy — we had to make a deci@@ sion in the first place ."
"And second of all , it requi@@ res imag@@ in@@ ation ."
"We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different cho@@ ice , and then we need to be able to kind of spo@@ ol this imag@@ in@@ ary recor@@ d forward and imagine how things would be playing out in our present ."
"And in fact , the more we have of either of these things — the more ag@@ en@@ cy and the more imag@@ in@@ ation with re@@ spe@@ ct to a given re@@ gre@@ t , the more ac@@ u@@ te that re@@ gre@@ t will be ."
"So let &apos;s say for in@@ stance that you &apos;re on your way to your best friend &apos;s we@@ d@@ ding and you &apos;re trying to get to the air@@ port and you &apos;re stu@@ ck in terri@@ ble traf@@ fic , and you finally ar@@ ri@@ ve at your g@@ ate and you &apos;ve mis@@ sed your f@@ light ."
You &apos;re going to experience more re@@ gre@@ t in that situ@@ ation if you mis@@ sed your f@@ light by three minutes than if you mis@@ sed it by 20 .
Why ?
"Well because , if you mi@@ ss your f@@ light by three minutes , it is pain@@ fully e@@ asy to imagine that you could have made different deci@@ sions that would have led to a better out@@ come ."
&quot; &quot; I should have taken the bri@@ dge and not the tu@@ n@@ ne@@ l .
I should have gone through that y@@ el@@ low light . &quot; &quot; These are the clas@@ si@@ c con@@ di@@ tions that create re@@ gre@@ t .
"We feel re@@ gre@@ t when we think we are respon@@ si@@ ble for a deci@@ sion that came out bad@@ ly , but almost came out well ."
"Now within that fra@@ me@@ work , we can obvi@@ ously experience re@@ gre@@ t about a lot of different things ."
This s@@ es@@ sion today is about behavi@@ or@@ al econ@@ omi@@ cs .
And most of what we know about re@@ gre@@ t comes to us out of that dom@@ a@@ in .
"We have a v@@ ast body of liter@@ ature on con@@ sum@@ er and fin@@ an@@ cial deci@@ sions and the re@@ gre@@ ts as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with them — bu@@ y@@ er &apos;s re@@ mor@@ se , basically ."
"But then finally , it oc@@ cur@@ red to some resear@@ ch@@ ers to ste@@ p back and say , well o@@ kay , but over@@ all , what do we re@@ gre@@ t most in life ?"
Here &apos;s what the ans@@ w@@ ers turn out to look like .
"So top six re@@ gre@@ ts — the things we re@@ gre@@ t most in life : N@@ um@@ ber one by far , education ."
3@@ 3 percent of all of our re@@ gre@@ ts per@@ tain to deci@@ sions we made about education .
We wi@@ sh we &apos;d got@@ ten more of it .
We wi@@ sh we &apos;d taken better adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of the education that we did have .
We wi@@ sh we &apos;d cho@@ s@@ en to study a different top@@ ic .
"O@@ thers very high on our li@@ st of re@@ gre@@ ts inclu@@ de car@@ e@@ er , ro@@ m@@ ance , par@@ ent@@ ing , v@@ ari@@ ous deci@@ sions and cho@@ i@@ ces about our sense of self and how we spend our le@@ i@@ sure time — or actually more speci@@ fi@@ cally , how we fa@@ il to spend our le@@ i@@ sure time ."
"The re@@ ma@@ ining re@@ gre@@ ts per@@ tain to these things : fin@@ ance , family issu@@ es un@@ re@@ lated to ro@@ m@@ ance or par@@ ent@@ ing , health , friends , spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ ality and community ."
"So in other words , we know most of what we know about re@@ gre@@ t by the study of fin@@ ance ."
"But it turns out , when you look over@@ all at what people re@@ gre@@ t in life , you know what , our fin@@ an@@ cial deci@@ sions don &apos;t even ran@@ k ."
They ac@@ coun@@ t for less than three percent of our tot@@ al re@@ gre@@ ts .
"So if you &apos;re sitting there stre@@ s@@ sing about large ca@@ p ver@@ su@@ s small ca@@ p , or company A ver@@ su@@ s company B , or should you bu@@ y the Su@@ bar@@ u or the P@@ ri@@ us , you know what , let it go ."
"Od@@ ds are , you &apos;re not going to care in five years ."
"But for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience pro@@ found re@@ gre@@ t around , what does that experience feel like ?"
We all know the shor@@ t answer .
It feel@@ s terri@@ ble . Re@@ gre@@ t feel@@ s aw@@ ful .
But it turns out that re@@ gre@@ t feel@@ s aw@@ ful in four very speci@@ fic and consi@@ st@@ ent ways .
So the first consi@@ st@@ ent com@@ pon@@ ent of re@@ gre@@ t is basically d@@ eni@@ al .
"When I went home that night after getting my tat@@ too , I basically sta@@ yed up all night ."
"And for the first se@@ ver@@ al hours , there was exactly one thought in my head ."
"And the thought was , &quot; M@@ ake it go away ! &quot;"
This is an un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably pri@@ mi@@ tive emoti@@ onal respon@@ se .
"I mean , it &apos;s right up there with , &quot; &quot; I want my mom@@ my ! &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not trying to sol@@ ve the problem ."
We &apos;re not trying to understand how the problem came about .
We just want it to v@@ ani@@ sh .
The second char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ stic com@@ pon@@ ent of re@@ gre@@ t is a sense of be@@ wil@@ der@@ ment .
"So the other thing I thought about there in my be@@ dro@@ om that night was , &quot; &quot; How could I have done that ?"
What was I thinking ? &quot; &quot; This real sense of al@@ ien@@ ation from the part of us that made a deci@@ sion we re@@ gre@@ t .
We can &apos;t iden@@ ti@@ fy with that part .
We don &apos;t understand that part .
"And we cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t have any em@@ pa@@ th@@ y for that part — which expla@@ ins the third consi@@ st@@ ent com@@ pon@@ ent of re@@ gre@@ t , which is an inten@@ se de@@ si@@ re to pu@@ ni@@ sh ourselves ."
"That &apos;s why , in the face of our re@@ gre@@ t , the thing we consi@@ st@@ ently say is , &quot; &quot; I could have ki@@ cked myself . &quot; &quot; The f@@ our@@ th com@@ pon@@ ent here is that re@@ gre@@ t is what psycho@@ logi@@ sts call per@@ se@@ ver@@ ative ."
To per@@ se@@ ver@@ ate means to fo@@ cus ob@@ s@@ es@@ si@@ vely and re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly on the ex@@ act same thing .
Now the effe@@ ct of per@@ se@@ ver@@ ation is to basically take these first three com@@ pon@@ ents of re@@ gre@@ t and put them on an in@@ fini@@ te loo@@ p .
"So it &apos;s not that I s@@ at there in my be@@ dro@@ om that night , thinking , &quot; &quot; M@@ ake it go away . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s that I s@@ at there and I thought , &quot; &quot; M@@ ake it go away . M@@ ake it go away ."
"M@@ ake it go away . M@@ ake it go away . &quot; &quot; So if you look at the psycho@@ logi@@ cal liter@@ ature , these are the four consi@@ st@@ ent de@@ fin@@ ing com@@ pon@@ ents of re@@ gre@@ t ."
But I want to su@@ ggest that there &apos;s also a fi@@ f@@ th one .
And I think of this as a kind of ex@@ ist@@ enti@@ al wa@@ ke@@ -@@ up call .
"That night in my a@@ part@@ ment , after I got done ki@@ c@@ king myself and so for@@ th , I l@@ ay in bed for a long time , and I thought about sk@@ in gra@@ f@@ ts ."
"And then I thought about how , much as tra@@ vel in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce doesn &apos;t co@@ ver ac@@ ts of God , probably my health in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce did not co@@ ver ac@@ ts of i@@ di@@ o@@ cy ."
"In point of fact , no in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce co@@ ver@@ s ac@@ ts of i@@ di@@ o@@ cy ."
"The whole point of ac@@ ts of i@@ di@@ o@@ cy is that they leave you tot@@ ally un@@ in@@ su@@ red ; they leave you ex@@ posed to the world and ex@@ posed to your own v@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability and fal@@ li@@ bility in face of , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , a fa@@ ir@@ ly in@@ different universe ."
This is obvi@@ ously an incredi@@ bly pain@@ ful experience .
"And I think it &apos;s parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly pain@@ ful for us now in the W@@ est in the g@@ ri@@ ps of what I sometimes think of as a Con@@ tro@@ l-@@ Z culture — Con@@ tro@@ l-@@ Z like the computer comm@@ and , un@@ do ."
"We &apos;re incredi@@ bly used to not having to face life &apos;s hard reali@@ ties , in a certain sense ."
We think we can th@@ row money at the problem or th@@ row technology at the problem — we can un@@ do and un@@ friend and un@@ fol@@ low .
And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we des@@ per@@ ately want to change and we cannot .
"S@@ ome@@ times instead of Con@@ tro@@ l-@@ Z , we actually have zer@@ o control ."
"And for those of us who are control fre@@ ak@@ s and perfe@@ cti@@ on@@ ist@@ s — and I know where of I speak — this is really hard , because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right ."
"Now there is a case to be made that control fre@@ ak@@ s and perfe@@ cti@@ on@@ ist@@ s should not get tat@@ to@@ os , and I &apos;m going to re@@ turn to that point in a few minutes ."
But first I want to say that the inten@@ sity and per@@ si@@ st@@ ence with which we experience these emoti@@ onal com@@ pon@@ ents of re@@ gre@@ t is obvi@@ ously going to v@@ ary depen@@ ding on the speci@@ fic thing that we &apos;re feeling re@@ gre@@ t@@ ful about .
"So for in@@ stance , here &apos;s one of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te au@@ tom@@ atic gener@@ at@@ ors of re@@ gre@@ t in moder@@ n life ."
( Laughter ) T@@ ex@@ t : R@@ el@@ py to all .
"And the amazing thing about this really in@@ si@@ di@@ ous technologi@@ cal in@@ no@@ vation is that even just with this one thing , we can experience a huge r@@ ange of re@@ gre@@ t ."
You can ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally h@@ it &quot; &quot; re@@ ply all &quot; &quot; to an e@@ ma@@ il and tor@@ pe@@ do a relation@@ ship .
O@@ r you can just have an incredi@@ bly em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing day at work .
O@@ r you can have your last day at work .
And this doesn &apos;t even tou@@ ch on the really pro@@ found re@@ gre@@ ts of a life .
"Because of course , sometimes we do make deci@@ sions that have ir@@ re@@ v@@ oc@@ able and terri@@ ble con@@ sequ@@ ences , either for our own or for other people &apos;s health and happ@@ iness and li@@ ve@@ li@@ ho@@ ods , and in the very wor@@ st case scen@@ ari@@ o , even their lives ."
"Now obvi@@ ously , those kinds of re@@ gre@@ ts are incredi@@ bly pier@@ cing and en@@ during ."
"I mean , even the stu@@ pi@@ d &quot; &quot; re@@ ply all &quot; &quot; re@@ gre@@ ts can leave us in a f@@ it of ex@@ c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating ag@@ ony for days ."
So how are we sup@@ posed to live with this ?
I want to su@@ ggest that there &apos;s three things that help us to make our pe@@ ace with re@@ gre@@ t .
And the first of these is to take some comfor@@ t in its uni@@ vers@@ ality .
"If you Go@@ og@@ le re@@ gre@@ t and tat@@ too , you will get 1@@ 1@@ .@@ 5 million hi@@ ts ."
"( Laughter ) The F@@ D@@ A est@@ im@@ ates that of all the Ameri@@ cans who have tat@@ to@@ os , 1@@ 7 percent of us re@@ gre@@ t getting them ."
That is Joh@@ n@@ ny De@@ p@@ p and me and our seven million friends .
And that &apos;s just re@@ gre@@ t about tat@@ to@@ os .
We are all in this together .
The second way that we can help make our pe@@ ace with re@@ gre@@ t is to l@@ au@@ gh at ourselves .
"Now in my case , this really wasn &apos;t a problem , because it &apos;s actually very e@@ asy to l@@ au@@ gh at yourself when you &apos;re 2@@ 9 years old and you want your mom@@ my because you don &apos;t like your new tat@@ too ."
But it might se@@ em like a kind of c@@ ru@@ el or g@@ li@@ b su@@ gg@@ esti@@ on when it comes to these more pro@@ found re@@ gre@@ ts .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the case though .
All of us who &apos;ve exper@@ ien@@ ced re@@ gre@@ t that con@@ ta@@ ins real pa@@ in and real gr@@ ie@@ f understand that hu@@ mo@@ r and even black hu@@ mo@@ r pla@@ ys a c@@ ru@@ cial ro@@ le in hel@@ ping us survi@@ ve .
"It conne@@ cts the po@@ les of our lives back together , the posi@@ tive and the neg@@ ative , and it sen@@ ds a little cur@@ r@@ ent of life back into us ."
"The third way that I think we can help make our pe@@ ace with re@@ gre@@ t is through the pas@@ s@@ age of time , which , as we know , he@@ als all w@@ oun@@ ds — ex@@ cept for tat@@ to@@ os , which are per@@ man@@ ent ."
So it &apos;s been se@@ ver@@ al years since I got my own tat@@ too .
And do you guys just want to see it ?
All right .
"A@@ c@@ tually , you know what , I should war@@ n you , you &apos;re going to be disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ted ."
Because it &apos;s actually not that hi@@ de@@ ous .
I didn &apos;t tat@@ too Mar@@ il@@ y@@ n M@@ an@@ son &apos;s face on some indi@@ scre@@ et part of myself or something .
"When other people see my tat@@ too , for the most part they like how it looks ."
It &apos;s just that I don &apos;t like how it looks .
"And as I said ear@@ lie@@ r , I &apos;m a perfe@@ cti@@ oni@@ st ."
But I &apos;ll let you see it any@@ way .
This is my tat@@ too .
I can gu@@ ess what some of you are thinking .
So let me reas@@ sure you about something .
S@@ ome of your own re@@ gre@@ ts are also not as u@@ g@@ ly as you think they are .
I got this tat@@ too because I spent most of my 20@@ s living outside the country and tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing .
"And when I came and se@@ t@@ t@@ led in New York af@@ ter@@ ward , I was wor@@ ried that I would for@@ get some of the most important l@@ ess@@ ons that I learned during that time ."
"S@@ pe@@ ci@@ fi@@ cally the two things I learned about myself that I most didn &apos;t want to for@@ get was how important it felt to keep expl@@ or@@ ing and , si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously , how important it is to some@@ how keep an ey@@ e on your own true nor@@ th ."
And what I lo@@ ved about this image of the comp@@ as@@ s was that I felt like it en@@ cap@@ su@@ lated both of these ideas in one simple image .
And I thought it might ser@@ ve as a kind of per@@ man@@ ent m@@ ne@@ mon@@ ic de@@ vice .
Well it did .
"But it turns out , it doesn &apos;t re@@ mind me of the thing I thought it would ; it re@@ min@@ ds me con@@ stan@@ tly of something else instead ."
"It actually re@@ min@@ ds me of the most important l@@ es@@ son re@@ gre@@ t can te@@ ach us , which is also one of the most important l@@ ess@@ ons life teach@@ es us ."
"And i@@ ro@@ ni@@ cally , I think it &apos;s probably the single most important thing I possi@@ bly could have tat@@ to@@ o@@ ed on@@ to my body — par@@ tly as a wri@@ ter , but also just as a human being ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s the thing , if we have go@@ als and dre@@ am@@ s , and we want to do our best , and if we love people and we don &apos;t want to h@@ ur@@ t them or lo@@ se them , we should feel pa@@ in when things go wrong ."
The point isn &apos;t to live without any re@@ gre@@ ts .
The point is to not h@@ ate ourselves for having them .
"The l@@ es@@ son that I ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely learned from my tat@@ too and that I want to leave you with today is this : We need to learn to love the fl@@ aw@@ ed , im@@ perfe@@ ct things that we create and to for@@ give ourselves for cre@@ ating them ."
Re@@ gre@@ t doesn &apos;t re@@ mind us that we did bad@@ ly .
It re@@ min@@ ds us that we know we can do better .
Thank you .

But that wasn &apos;t the bi@@ ggest l@@ es@@ son I ever learned .
The bi@@ ggest l@@ es@@ son I learned was many years later when I went to Be@@ ver@@ ly H@@ il@@ ls and I ran into a tal@@ ent ag@@ ent who looked at me up and down and said I don &apos;t look like I have any experience to be working in this business .
"And I said to him , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , pun@@ k fo@@ ol , you &apos;re a fai@@ led ac@@ tor who became an ag@@ ent , and you know why you fai@@ led as an ac@@ tor ?"
Because people like me took your job .

And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that .
I &apos;ve cam@@ ped my whole life . And I decided that living in a v@@ an for a year to do this would be like one long cam@@ ping tri@@ p .
"So I pac@@ ked my c@@ at , my R@@ ot@@ t@@ we@@ i@@ ler and my cam@@ ping ge@@ ar into a 19@@ 7@@ 5 Ch@@ ev@@ y v@@ an , and dro@@ ve off into the su@@ n@@ set , having fully fai@@ led to realize three cri@@ tical things ."

My fre@@ el@@ ance job en@@ ded . And I had to get a fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time job to pay the bi@@ l@@ ls .
What had been a really mi@@ ld sp@@ ring turned into a mi@@ ser@@ ably ho@@ t sum@@ m@@ er .
"And it became im@@ possible to par@@ k any@@ where — ( L@@ augh@@ s ) — without being very obvi@@ ous that I had a c@@ at and a do@@ g with me , and it was really ho@@ t ."

And I fac@@ ed a whole new set of challen@@ ges .
I par@@ ked a different place every night so I would av@@ o@@ id being noti@@ ced and ha@@ s@@ s@@ led by the poli@@ ce .
I didn &apos;t always suc@@ ce@@ ed .

"And I don &apos;t know when or how it happened , but the speed at which I went from being a tal@@ en@@ ted wri@@ ter and jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st to being a hom@@ el@@ ess woman , living in a v@@ an , took my bre@@ ath away ."

You should too .

"The fol@@ low@@ ing are my op@@ ini@@ ons , and do not ref@@ le@@ ct the op@@ ini@@ ons or poli@@ cies of any particular pro@@ secu@@ tor &apos;s offi@@ ce ."
( Laughter ) I am a pro@@ secu@@ tor .
I believe in la@@ w and order .
I believe in ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability and that we should all be sa@@ fe in our communi@@ ties .
I love my job and the people that do it .
I just think that it &apos;s our respon@@ si@@ bility to do it better .
( Laughter ) All right .
( Laughter ) Po@@ int taken .
My life and my leg@@ al car@@ e@@ er changed the first day of that inter@@ n@@ ship .

"So the A@@ w@@ es@@ ome story : It begin@@ s about 40 years ago , when my mo@@ m and my d@@ ad came to C@@ an@@ ada ."
"My mo@@ m left Na@@ i@@ robi , Ken@@ ya ."
"My d@@ ad left a small vi@@ ll@@ age outside of Am@@ ri@@ t@@ sa@@ r , Indi@@ a ."

"We gre@@ w up , and we gre@@ w ol@@ der ."
I went to high school .
I gra@@ du@@ ated .
"I mo@@ ved out of the house , I got a job , I found a girl , I se@@ t@@ t@@ led down — and I realize it sounds like a bad si@@ t@@ co@@ m or a C@@ at Ste@@ ven@@ s &apos; s@@ ong — ( Laughter ) but life was pretty good ."
Li@@ fe was pretty good .
200@@ 6 was a great year .
"U@@ n@@ der clear blue sk@@ ies in Ju@@ ly in the w@@ ine regi@@ on of O@@ n@@ t@@ ari@@ o , I got mar@@ ried , sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by 1@@ 50 family and friends ."

"H@@ ere &apos;s a picture of me and my friend , Ch@@ ris , on the co@@ ast of the P@@ aci@@ fic O@@ ce@@ an ."
"We actually saw se@@ als out of our car win@@ do@@ w , and we pul@@ led over to take a qui@@ ck picture of them and then blo@@ cked them with our gi@@ ant he@@ ads ."
"( Laughter ) So you can &apos;t actually see them , but it was bre@@ a@@ th@@ taking , believe me . ( Laughter )"
200@@ 8 and 200@@ 9 were a little tou@@ gh@@ er .
"I know that they were tou@@ gh@@ er for a lot of people , not just me ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , the news was so he@@ av@@ y ."
"It &apos;s still he@@ av@@ y now , and it was he@@ av@@ y before that , but when you fli@@ pped open a ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er , when you turned on the T@@ V , it was about ice ca@@ ps me@@ l@@ ting , war@@ s going on around the world , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es , h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ es and an econom@@ y that was w@@ ob@@ b@@ ling on the br@@ in@@ k of col@@ lap@@ se , and then ev@@ en@@ tually did col@@ lap@@ se , and so many of us lo@@ sing our hom@@ es , or our j@@ ob@@ s , or our re@@ ti@@ re@@ ments , or our li@@ ve@@ li@@ ho@@ ods ."
"@@ 200@@ 8 , 200@@ 9 were he@@ av@@ y years for me for another reason , too ."
I was going through a lot of per@@ s@@ onal problems at the time .
"My mar@@ ri@@ age wasn &apos;t going well , and we just were grow@@ ing f@@ ur@@ ther and f@@ ur@@ ther a@@ part ."
"One day my wi@@ fe came home from work and sum@@ mon@@ ed the cou@@ ra@@ ge , through a lot of te@@ ars , to have a very hon@@ est convers@@ ation ."

"My friend Ch@@ ris , who I just show@@ ed you a picture of , had been bat@@ t@@ ling ment@@ al il@@ l@@ ness for some time ."
"And for those of you wh@@ ose lives have been tou@@ ched by ment@@ al il@@ l@@ ness , you know how challen@@ g@@ ing it can be ."
I spo@@ ke to him on the phone at 10 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ .
on a S@@ un@@ day night .
We tal@@ ked about the T@@ V show we wat@@ ched that ev@@ ening .
"And M@@ on@@ day morning , I found out that he disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ared ."
"@@ V@@ ery s@@ ad@@ ly , he took his own life ."
And it was a really he@@ av@@ y time .
"And as these dar@@ k cl@@ ou@@ ds were cir@@ c@@ ling me , and I was fin@@ ding it really , really difficult to think of anything good , I said to myself that I really needed a way to fo@@ cus on the posi@@ tive some@@ how ."
"So I came home from work one night , and I lo@@ gg@@ ed on@@ to the computer , and I started up a t@@ iny we@@ b@@ site called 10@@ 0@@ 0@@ aw@@ es@@ ome@@ thin@@ g@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ ."
"I was trying to re@@ mind myself of the simple , uni@@ vers@@ al , little ple@@ as@@ ures that we all love , but we just don &apos;t talk about enough — things like wai@@ ters and wa@@ it@@ re@@ s@@ ses who bring you f@@ ree re@@ fil@@ ls without as@@ king , being the first table to get called up to the din@@ ner bu@@ f@@ f@@ et at a we@@ d@@ ding , we@@ aring war@@ m under@@ we@@ ar from just out of the d@@ ry@@ er , or when c@@ ash@@ ier@@ s open up a new che@@ ck@@ -@@ out l@@ ane at the gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e and you get to be first in line — even if you were last at the other line , swo@@ o@@ p right in there ."
"( Laughter ) And s@@ low@@ ly over time , I started pu@@ tting myself in a better mo@@ od ."
"I mean , 5@@ 0,000 blo@@ gs are started a day , and so my blo@@ g was just one of those 5@@ 0,000 ."
And no@@ body read it ex@@ cept for my mo@@ m .
Al@@ though I should say that my traf@@ fic did sk@@ y@@ ro@@ ck@@ et and go up by 100 percent when she for@@ war@@ ded it to my d@@ ad .
"( Laughter ) And then I got exci@@ ted when it started getting ten@@ s of hi@@ ts , and then I started getting exci@@ ted when it started getting do@@ z@@ ens and then hundre@@ ds and then thousands and then mi@@ llions ."
It started getting bi@@ g@@ ger and bi@@ g@@ ger and bi@@ g@@ ger .
"And then I got a phone call , and the vo@@ ice at the other end of the line said , &quot; You &apos;ve just won the B@@ est B@@ lo@@ g In the World aw@@ ard . &quot;"
"I was like , that sounds tot@@ ally fak@@ e ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Wh@@ ich Afri@@ can country do you want me to wi@@ re all my money to ? ( Laughter )
"But it turns out , I j@@ um@@ ped on a pl@@ ane , and I en@@ ded up wal@@ king a red car@@ pe@@ t between S@@ ar@@ ah S@@ il@@ ver@@ man and J@@ im@@ my F@@ al@@ l@@ on and Mar@@ th@@ a Ste@@ war@@ t ."

"And the sur@@ pri@@ se and just the amaz@@ ement of that was only over@@ sha@@ dow@@ ed by my re@@ turn to T@@ o@@ ron@@ to , when , in my in@@ box , 10 liter@@ ary ag@@ ents were wai@@ ting for me to talk about pu@@ tting this into a book ."
F@@ las@@ h@@ -@@ forward to the next year and &quot; &quot; The B@@ ook of A@@ w@@ es@@ ome &quot; &quot; has now been number one on the be@@ st@@ sel@@ ler li@@ st for 20 stra@@ ight weeks .
"( Applause ) But look , I said I wanted to do three things with you today ."
"I said I wanted to tell you the A@@ w@@ es@@ ome story , I wanted to share with you the three A@@ s of A@@ w@@ es@@ ome , and I wanted to leave you with a clo@@ sing thought ."
So let &apos;s talk about those three A@@ s .
"O@@ ver the last few years , I ha@@ ven &apos;t had that much time to really think ."
"But lat@@ ely I have had the opportunity to take a ste@@ p back and ask myself : &quot; &quot; What is it over the last few years that hel@@ ped me gro@@ w my we@@ b@@ site , but also gro@@ w myself ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed those things , for me per@@ son@@ ally , as three A@@ s ."
"They are At@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , A@@ war@@ en@@ ess and Au@@ th@@ enti@@ city ."
I &apos;d love to just talk about each one br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly .
"So At@@ ti@@ tu@@ de : L@@ ook , we &apos;re all going to get lu@@ m@@ ps , and we &apos;re all going to get bu@@ m@@ ps ."
"N@@ one of us can pre@@ di@@ ct the future , but we do know one thing about it and that &apos;s that it a@@ in &apos;t g@@ on@@ na go ac@@ cor@@ ding to pl@@ an ."
"We will all have high high@@ s and big days and pro@@ u@@ d mom@@ ents of s@@ miles on gra@@ du@@ ation st@@ ages , fa@@ ther@@ -@@ d@@ aughter dan@@ ces at we@@ dd@@ ings and health@@ y b@@ ab@@ ies scre@@ ech@@ ing in the deli@@ very room , but between those high high@@ s , we may also have some lu@@ m@@ ps and some bu@@ m@@ ps too ."
"It &apos;s sa@@ d , and it &apos;s not ple@@ as@@ ant to talk about , but your h@@ us@@ b@@ and might leave you , your gir@@ l@@ friend could che@@ at , your he@@ ad@@ ach@@ es might be more seri@@ ous than you thought , or your do@@ g could get h@@ it by a car on the stre@@ et ."
"It &apos;s not a happy thought , but your kids could get mi@@ x@@ ed up in g@@ an@@ gs or bad scen@@ es ."
"@@ Y@@ our mo@@ m could get can@@ cer , your d@@ ad could get mean ."
"And there are times in life when you will be to@@ s@@ sed in the well , too , with t@@ wi@@ sts in your st@@ om@@ ach and with ho@@ les in your heart , and when that bad news wa@@ sh@@ es over you , and when that pa@@ in spon@@ ges and so@@ ak@@ s in , I just really hope you feel like you &apos;ve always got two cho@@ i@@ ces ."
"One , you can s@@ wi@@ r@@ l and t@@ wi@@ r@@ l and g@@ lo@@ om and do@@ om fore@@ ver , or two , you can gr@@ ie@@ ve and then face the future with ne@@ w@@ ly so@@ ber eyes ."
"H@@ a@@ ving a great at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de is about cho@@ os@@ ing op@@ tion number two , and cho@@ os@@ ing , no matter how difficult it is , no matter what pa@@ in hi@@ ts you , cho@@ os@@ ing to move forward and move on and take b@@ aby ste@@ ps into the future ."
The second &quot; &quot; A &quot; &quot; is A@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
I love h@@ ang@@ ing out with three year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds .
"I love the way that they see the world , because they &apos;re seeing the world for the first time ."
I love the way that they can st@@ are at a bu@@ g cro@@ s@@ sing the si@@ de@@ walk .
"I love the way that they &apos;ll st@@ are sl@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ j@@ aw@@ ed at their first bas@@ e@@ ball g@@ ame with wi@@ de eyes and a mi@@ t@@ t on their hand , so@@ aking in the c@@ rac@@ k of the b@@ at and the c@@ ru@@ n@@ ch of the pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts and the s@@ me@@ ll of the hot@@ do@@ gs ."
I love the way that they &apos;ll spend hours pi@@ c@@ king dan@@ deli@@ ons in the back@@ y@@ ard and pu@@ tting them into a nice cen@@ ter@@ piece for Th@@ an@@ k@@ s@@ gi@@ ving din@@ ner .
"I love the way that they see the world , because they &apos;re seeing the world for the first time ."
Ha@@ ving a sense of aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess is just about em@@ brac@@ ing your in@@ ner three year@@ -@@ old .
Because you all used to be three years old .
That thre@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y is still part of you .
That thre@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ old girl is still part of you .
They &apos;re in there .
"And being aw@@ are is just about re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing that you saw everything you &apos;ve seen for the first time once , too ."
So there was a time when it was your first time ever hi@@ tting a str@@ ing of green li@@ ghts on the way home from work .
"There was the first time you wal@@ ked by the open door of a b@@ ak@@ ery and s@@ me@@ l@@ t the b@@ ak@@ ery air , or the first time you pul@@ led a 20@@ -@@ dol@@ lar bi@@ ll out of your old j@@ ac@@ k@@ et po@@ ck@@ et and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ound money . &quot; &quot; The last &quot; &quot; A &quot; &quot; is Au@@ th@@ enti@@ city ."
"And for this one , I want to tell you a qui@@ ck story ."
"L@@ et &apos;s go all the way back to 19@@ 3@@ 2 when , on a pe@@ an@@ u@@ t far@@ m in G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , a little b@@ aby bo@@ y na@@ med Ro@@ o@@ se@@ v@@ el@@ t G@@ r@@ ier was born ."
"R@@ o@@ o@@ se@@ v@@ el@@ t G@@ r@@ ier , or Ro@@ se@@ y G@@ r@@ ier , as people used to call him , gre@@ w up and gre@@ w into a 3@@ 0@@ 0-@@ po@@ u@@ nd , si@@ x@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ -@@ five lin@@ e@@ back@@ er in the N@@ F@@ L ."
He &apos;s number 7@@ 6 in the picture .
Here he is pi@@ ctu@@ red with the &quot; &quot; fe@@ ar@@ some f@@ our@@ some . &quot; &quot; These were four guys on the L@@ .@@ A@@ . R@@ am@@ s in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s you did not want to go up against .
"They were t@@ ough fo@@ ot@@ ball pla@@ y@@ ers doing what they love , which was c@@ rus@@ h@@ ing sk@@ ul@@ ls and se@@ par@@ ating sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders on the fo@@ ot@@ ball fie@@ ld ."
But Ro@@ se@@ y G@@ r@@ ier also had another pas@@ sion .
"In his de@@ e@@ ply au@@ th@@ enti@@ c self , he also lo@@ ved need@@ le@@ point . ( Laughter ) He lo@@ ved k@@ ni@@ tting ."
"He said that it cal@@ med him down , it re@@ la@@ x@@ ed him , it took away his fe@@ ar of fl@@ ying and hel@@ ped him me@@ et chi@@ cks ."
That &apos;s what he said .
"I mean , he lo@@ ved it so much that , after he re@@ ti@@ red from the N@@ F@@ L , he started jo@@ ining clu@@ b@@ s ."
And he even put out a book called &quot; &quot; Ro@@ se@@ y G@@ r@@ ier &apos;s Ne@@ ed@@ le@@ point for M@@ en . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a great co@@ ver .
"If you noti@@ ce , he &apos;s actually need@@ le@@ poin@@ ting his own face ."
"( Laughter ) And so what I love about this story is that Ro@@ se@@ y G@@ r@@ ier is just such an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c person , and that &apos;s what au@@ th@@ enti@@ city is all about ."
It &apos;s just about being you and being cool with that .
"And I think when you &apos;re au@@ th@@ enti@@ c , you end up fol@@ low@@ ing your heart , and you put yourself in places and situ@@ ations and in convers@@ ations that you love and that you en@@ jo@@ y ."
You me@@ et people that you like talking to .
You go places you &apos;ve dre@@ am@@ t about .
And you end you end up fol@@ low@@ ing your heart and feeling very fu@@ l@@ fil@@ led .
So those are the three A &apos;s .
"For the clo@@ sing thought , I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to C@@ an@@ ada ."
I don &apos;t know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you &apos;re in your mi@@ d-@@ 20@@ s .
"I don &apos;t know , because I never did it , but I would imagine that it would take a great at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de ."
I would imagine that you &apos;d have to be pretty aw@@ are of your sur@@ ro@@ un@@ dings and ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ating the small won@@ ders that you &apos;re star@@ ting to see in your new world .
"And I think you &apos;d have to be really au@@ th@@ enti@@ c , you &apos;d have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you &apos;re being ex@@ posed to ."
"I &apos;d like to pa@@ use my TE@@ D@@ T@@ al@@ k for about 10 secon@@ ds right now , because you don &apos;t get many opportuni@@ ties in life to do something like this , and my parents are sitting in the front row ."
"So I wanted to ask them to , if they don &apos;t mind , stand up ."
And I just wanted to say th@@ ank you to you guys .
"( Applause ) When I was grow@@ ing up , my d@@ ad used to love tel@@ ling the story of his first day in C@@ an@@ ada ."
"And it &apos;s a great story , because what happened was he got off the pl@@ ane at the T@@ o@@ ron@@ to air@@ port , and he was wel@@ com@@ ed by a n@@ on-@@ prof@@ it group , which I &apos;m sure someone in this room ru@@ ns ."
( Laughter ) And this n@@ on-@@ prof@@ it group had a big wel@@ coming lu@@ n@@ ch for all the new im@@ mi@@ gran@@ ts to C@@ an@@ ada .
And my d@@ ad says he got off the pl@@ ane and he went to this lu@@ n@@ ch and there was this huge sp@@ read .
"There was b@@ read , there was those little , min@@ i di@@ ll pi@@ ck@@ les , there was o@@ lives , those little white oni@@ ons ."
"There was rol@@ led up tur@@ key c@@ old cu@@ ts , rol@@ led up ha@@ m c@@ old cu@@ ts , rol@@ led up ro@@ ast be@@ e@@ f c@@ old cu@@ ts and little cu@@ be@@ s of che@@ ese ."
There was tu@@ na s@@ al@@ ad s@@ and@@ wi@@ ch@@ es and e@@ g@@ g s@@ al@@ ad s@@ and@@ wi@@ ch@@ es and s@@ al@@ m@@ on s@@ al@@ ad s@@ and@@ wi@@ ch@@ es .
"There was las@@ ag@@ na , there was c@@ as@@ ser@@ o@@ les , there was b@@ row@@ nie@@ s , there was bu@@ t@@ ter tar@@ ts , and there was pie@@ s , lots and lots of pie@@ s ."
"And when my d@@ ad tel@@ ls the story , he says , &quot; &quot; The c@@ raz@@ ie@@ st thing was , I &apos;d never seen any of that before , ex@@ cept b@@ read ."
"( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know what was me@@ at , what was ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ari@@ an ."
I was e@@ ating o@@ lives with p@@ ie .
"( Laughter ) I just couldn &apos;t believe how many things you can get here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) When I was five years old , my d@@ ad used to take me gro@@ cer@@ y sh@@ op@@ ping , and he would st@@ are in won@@ der at the little sti@@ ck@@ ers that are on the f@@ ru@@ its and ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les ."
"He would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , can you believe they have a man@@ go here from M@@ exi@@ co ?"
They &apos;ve got an app@@ le here from S@@ outh Africa .
"C@@ an you believe they &apos;ve got a d@@ ate from Mo@@ ro@@ c@@ co ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Do you know where Mo@@ ro@@ c@@ co even is ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m five . I don &apos;t even know where I am ."
"I@@ s this A &a@@ m@@ p@@ ; P ? &quot; &quot; And he &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know where Mo@@ ro@@ c@@ co is either , but let &apos;s find out . &quot; &quot; And so we &apos;d bu@@ y the d@@ ate , and we &apos;d go home ."
"And we &apos;d actually take an at@@ l@@ as off the sh@@ el@@ f , and we &apos;d fli@@ p through until we found this m@@ yst@@ eri@@ ous country ."
"And when we did , my d@@ ad would say , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you believe someone clim@@ bed a t@@ ree over there , pi@@ cked this thing off it , put it in a tru@@ ck , dro@@ ve it all the way to the do@@ cks and then sa@@ i@@ led it all the way across the At@@ lan@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an and then put it in another tru@@ ck and dro@@ ve that all the way to a t@@ iny gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e just outside our house , so they could se@@ ll it to us for 25 c@@ ents ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe it either ."
"Th@@ ings are amazing . There &apos;s just so many things to be happy about . &quot; &quot; When I stop to think about it , he &apos;s absolu@@ tely right ."
There are so many things to be happy about .
"We are the only species on the only li@@ fe@@ -@@ gi@@ ving ro@@ ck in the entire universe that we &apos;ve ever seen , cap@@ able of exper@@ ien@@ cing so many of these things ."
"I mean , we &apos;re the only ones with archite@@ cture and agri@@ culture ."
We &apos;re the only ones with je@@ wel@@ ry and de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y .
"We &apos;ve got air@@ plan@@ es , high@@ way lan@@ es , inter@@ i@@ or design and ho@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ e sig@@ ns ."
"We &apos;ve got fas@@ hi@@ on mag@@ az@@ ines , house par@@ ty scen@@ es ."
You can wat@@ ch a hor@@ ro@@ r movie with mon@@ st@@ ers .
You can go to a con@@ cer@@ t and hear gu@@ it@@ ars j@@ am@@ ming .
"We &apos;ve got boo@@ ks , bu@@ f@@ fe@@ ts and radi@@ o wa@@ ves , we@@ d@@ ding bri@@ des and rol@@ l@@ er@@ co@@ ast@@ er ri@@ des ."
You can sle@@ ep in cle@@ an sh@@ e@@ ets .
You can go to the mov@@ ies and get good se@@ ats .
"You can s@@ me@@ ll b@@ ak@@ ery air , walk around with ra@@ in ha@@ ir , po@@ p bu@@ b@@ ble w@@ ra@@ p or take an il@@ leg@@ al na@@ p ."
"We &apos;ve got all that , but we &apos;ve only got 100 years to en@@ jo@@ y it ."
And that &apos;s the sa@@ d part .
"The c@@ ash@@ ier@@ s at your gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e , the fore@@ man at your pl@@ ant , the guy ta@@ il@@ g@@ ating you home on the high@@ way , the tele@@ marke@@ ter cal@@ ling you during din@@ ner , every teach@@ er you &apos;ve ever had , everyone that &apos;s ever wok@@ en up be@@ side you , every poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an in every country , every ac@@ tor in every movie , every single person in your family , everyone you love , everyone in this room and you will be de@@ ad in a hundre@@ d years ."
Li@@ fe is so great that we only get such a shor@@ t time to experience and en@@ jo@@ y all those t@@ iny little mom@@ ents that make it so s@@ we@@ et .
"And that moment is right now , and those mom@@ ents are coun@@ ting down , and those mom@@ ents are always , always , always f@@ le@@ e@@ ting ."
You will never be as young as you are right now .
"And that &apos;s why I believe that if you live your life with a great at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , cho@@ os@@ ing to move forward and move on wh@@ en@@ ever life de@@ als you a b@@ low , living with a sense of aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess of the world around you , em@@ brac@@ ing your in@@ ner three year@@ -@@ old and seeing the t@@ iny jo@@ ys that make life so s@@ we@@ et and being au@@ th@@ enti@@ c to yourself , being you and being cool with that , le@@ tting your heart le@@ ad you and pu@@ tting yourself in exper@@ ien@@ ces that s@@ ati@@ s@@ fy you , then I think you &apos;ll live a life that is ri@@ ch and is s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying , and I think you &apos;ll live a life that is tru@@ ly aw@@ es@@ ome ."
Thank you .
How are they enti@@ t@@ led to prac@@ ti@@ ce ?
It &apos;s a simple idea about nature .
I want to say a word for nature because we ha@@ ven &apos;t tal@@ ked that much about it the last couple days .
"I want to say a word for the so@@ il and the bees and the plan@@ ts and the animals , and tell you about a to@@ ol , a very simple to@@ ol that I have found ."
Al@@ though it &apos;s really nothing more than a liter@@ ary con@@ ce@@ it ; it &apos;s not a technology .
"It &apos;s very powerful for , I think , chang@@ ing our relation@@ ship to the natural world and to the other species on wh@@ om we de@@ p@@ end ."
"And that to@@ ol is very simply , as Ch@@ ris su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed , looking at us and the world from the plan@@ ts &apos; or the animals &apos; point of view ."
"It &apos;s not my idea , other people have h@@ it on it , but I &apos;ve tr@@ ied to take it to some new places ."
Let me tell you where I got it .
"L@@ i@@ ke a lot of my ideas , like a lot of the to@@ ols I use , I found it in the gar@@ den ; I &apos;m a very de@@ v@@ ot@@ ed gar@@ den@@ er ."
"And there was a day about seven years ago : I was plan@@ ting pot@@ at@@ o@@ es , it was the first week of M@@ ay — this is New En@@ gl@@ and , when the app@@ le tre@@ es are just vi@@ br@@ ating with blo@@ om ; they &apos;re just white cl@@ ou@@ ds ab@@ o@@ ve ."
"I was here , plan@@ ting my ch@@ un@@ ks , cu@@ tting up pot@@ at@@ o@@ es and plan@@ ting it , and the bees were working on this t@@ ree ; bu@@ m@@ b@@ le@@ bees , just making this thing vi@@ br@@ ate ."
"And one of the things I really like about gar@@ den@@ ing is that it doesn &apos;t take all your con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation , you really can &apos;t get h@@ ur@@ t — it &apos;s not like wo@@ od@@ working — and you have pl@@ en@@ ty of kind of ment@@ al space for spe@@ cul@@ ation ."
"And the question I asked myself that af@@ ter@@ no@@ on in the gar@@ den , working al@@ on@@ g@@ side that bu@@ m@@ b@@ le@@ be@@ e , was : what did I and that bu@@ m@@ b@@ le@@ be@@ e have in common ?"
How was our ro@@ le in this gar@@ den si@@ mi@@ lar and different ?
"And I realized we actually had quite a bit in common : both of us were dis@@ se@@ min@@ ating the gen@@ es of one species and not another , and both of us — probably , if I can imagine the be@@ e &apos;s point of view — thought we were cal@@ ling the sh@@ ots ."
"I had decided what kind of po@@ ta@@ to I wanted to pl@@ ant — I had pi@@ cked my Y@@ u@@ k@@ on G@@ old or Y@@ el@@ low F@@ in@@ n , or whatever it was — and I had sum@@ mon@@ ed those gen@@ es from a se@@ ed cat@@ al@@ o@@ g across the country , brought it , and I was plan@@ ting it ."
"And that be@@ e , no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t , as@@ sum@@ ed that it had decided , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going for that app@@ le t@@ ree , I &apos;m going for that blo@@ s@@ so@@ m , I &apos;m going to get the ne@@ ct@@ ar and I &apos;m going to leave . &quot; &quot; We have a gra@@ m@@ m@@ ar that su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that &apos;s who we are ; that we are so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n sub@@ je@@ cts in nature , the be@@ e as well as me ."
"I pl@@ ant the pot@@ at@@ o@@ es , I we@@ ed the gar@@ den , I dom@@ esti@@ cate the species ."
"But that day , it oc@@ cur@@ red to me : what if that gra@@ m@@ m@@ ar is nothing more than a self-@@ ser@@ ving con@@ ce@@ it ?"
"Because , of course , the be@@ e thin@@ ks he &apos;s in char@@ ge or she &apos;s in char@@ ge , but we know better ."
We know that what &apos;s going on between the be@@ e and that f@@ low@@ er is that be@@ e has been cle@@ ver@@ ly m@@ ani@@ pu@@ lated by that f@@ low@@ er .
"And when I say m@@ ani@@ pu@@ lated , I &apos;m talking about in a D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ an sense , right ?"
"I mean it has ev@@ olved a very speci@@ fic set of tra@@ its — color , sc@@ ent , f@@ la@@ v@@ or , pat@@ ter@@ n — that has lu@@ red that be@@ e in ."
"And the be@@ e has been cle@@ ver@@ ly fo@@ o@@ led into taking the ne@@ ct@@ ar , and also pi@@ c@@ king up some pow@@ der on its le@@ g , and going off to the next blo@@ s@@ so@@ m ."
The be@@ e is not cal@@ ling the sh@@ ots .
"And I realized then , I wasn &apos;t either ."
"I had been se@@ du@@ ced by that po@@ ta@@ to and not another into plan@@ ting its — into sp@@ re@@ ading its gen@@ es , gi@@ ving it a little bit more ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at ."
"And that &apos;s when I got the idea , which was , &quot; &quot; Well , what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us ? &quot; &quot; And agri@@ culture sud@@ den@@ ly ap@@ pe@@ ared to me not as an inv@@ en@@ tion , not as a human technology , but as a co@@ -@@ ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary develo@@ pment in which a group of very cle@@ ver species , mo@@ st@@ ly e@@ di@@ ble gra@@ s@@ ses , had ex@@ plo@@ i@@ ted us , figu@@ red out how to get us to basically de@@ fore@@ st the world ."
"The compe@@ ti@@ tion of gra@@ s@@ ses , right ?"
And sud@@ den@@ ly everything looked different .
And sud@@ den@@ ly mow@@ ing the l@@ aw@@ n that day was a completely different experience .
"I had thought always — and in fact , had wri@@ t@@ ten this in my first book ; this was a book about gar@@ den@@ ing — that l@@ aw@@ ns were nature under culture &apos;s bo@@ ot , that they were tot@@ ali@@ t@@ ari@@ an land@@ s@@ cap@@ es , and that when we mow@@ ed them we were c@@ ru@@ el@@ ly sup@@ pres@@ sing the species and never le@@ tting it set se@@ ed or die or have se@@ x ."
And that &apos;s what the l@@ aw@@ n was .
"But then I realized , &quot; &quot; No , this is exactly what the gra@@ s@@ ses want us to do ."
"I &apos;m a du@@ pe . I &apos;m a du@@ pe of the l@@ aw@@ ns , wh@@ ose go@@ al in life is to out@@ compe@@ te the tre@@ es , who they compe@@ te with for su@@ n@@ light . &quot; &quot; And so by getting us to mo@@ w the l@@ aw@@ n , we keep the tre@@ es from coming back , which in New En@@ gl@@ and happens very , very quickly ."
"So I started looking at things this way and wro@@ te a whole book about it called &quot; &quot; The B@@ ot@@ any of De@@ si@@ re . &quot; &quot; And I realized that in the same way you can look at a f@@ low@@ er and de@@ du@@ ce all sor@@ ts of interesting things about the ta@@ ste and the de@@ si@@ res of bees — that they like s@@ we@@ et@@ ness , that they like this color and not that color , that they like sym@@ me@@ try — what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing ?"
"That a certain kind of po@@ ta@@ to , a certain kind of dru@@ g , a s@@ ati@@ v@@ a@@ -@@ indi@@ ca C@@ an@@ na@@ b@@ is c@@ ross has something to say about us ."
"And that , wouldn &apos;t this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world ?"
"Now , the test of any idea — I said it was a liter@@ ary con@@ ce@@ it — is what does it get us ?"
"And when you &apos;re talking about nature , which is really my sub@@ je@@ ct as a wri@@ ter , how does it me@@ et the Al@@ do Le@@ o@@ po@@ ld test ?"
"Wh@@ ich is , does it make us better ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens of the bi@@ oti@@ c community ?"
"G@@ et us to do things that le@@ ads to the sup@@ port and per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ation of the bi@@ ot@@ a , rather than its de@@ stru@@ ction ?"
And I would sub@@ m@@ it that this idea does this .
"So , let me go through what you ga@@ in when you look at the world this way , be@@ si@@ des some en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ining in@@ si@@ ghts about human de@@ si@@ re ."
"As an in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al matter , looking at the world from other species &apos; poin@@ ts of view hel@@ ps us deal with this we@@ ird an@@ om@@ al@@ y , which is — and this is in the re@@ al@@ m of in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al history — which is that we have this D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ an re@@ v@@ olution 1@@ 50 years ago ..."
"U@@ gh . M@@ ini@@ -@@ M@@ e . ( Laughter ) We have this in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al , this D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ an re@@ v@@ olution in which , th@@ an@@ ks to D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n , we figu@@ red out we are just one species am@@ ong many ; ev@@ olution is working on us the same way it &apos;s working on all the others ; we are ac@@ ted upo@@ n as well as ac@@ ting ; we are really in the fi@@ ber , the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of life ."
"But the we@@ ird thing is , we have not ab@@ sor@@ bed this l@@ es@@ son 1@@ 50 years later ; n@@ one of us really belie@@ ves this ."
"We are still C@@ ar@@ te@@ si@@ ans — the children of D@@ es@@ car@@ tes — who believe that sub@@ je@@ cti@@ vity , con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness , se@@ ts us a@@ part ; that the world is di@@ vi@@ ded into sub@@ je@@ cts and obje@@ cts ; that there is nature on one side , culture on another ."
"As so@@ on as you start seeing things from the pl@@ ant &apos;s point of view or the ani@@ mal &apos;s point of view , you realize that the real liter@@ ary con@@ ce@@ it is that — is the idea that nature is op@@ posed to culture , the idea that con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness is everything — and that &apos;s another very important thing it does ."
L@@ o@@ o@@ king at the world from other species &apos; poin@@ ts of view is a cu@@ re for the dise@@ ase of human self-@@ import@@ ance .
"You sud@@ den@@ ly realize that con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness — which we val@@ ue and we consi@@ der the c@@ row@@ ning ach@@ ie@@ v@@ ement of nature , human con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness — is really just another set of to@@ ols for getting along in the world ."
And it &apos;s kind of natural that we would think it was the best to@@ ol .
"But , you know , there &apos;s a com@@ e@@ di@@ an who said , &quot; &quot; Well , who &apos;s tel@@ ling me that con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness is so good and so important ?"
"Well , con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness . &quot; &quot; So when you look at the plan@@ ts , you realize that there are other to@@ ols and they &apos;re just as interesting ."
"I &apos;ll give you two exam@@ ples , also from the gar@@ den : li@@ ma be@@ ans . You know what a li@@ ma be@@ an does when it &apos;s att@@ ac@@ ked by spi@@ der mi@@ tes ?"
"It rele@@ ases this vol@@ ati@@ le chemi@@ cal that goes out into the world and sum@@ m@@ ons another species of mi@@ te that comes in and att@@ ac@@ ks the spi@@ der mi@@ te , def@@ ending the li@@ ma be@@ an ."
"So what plan@@ ts have — while we have con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness , to@@ ol making , language , they have bio@@ chemi@@ stry ."
And they have perfe@@ cted that to a de@@ gre@@ e far be@@ y@@ ond what we can imagine .
"Th@@ e@@ ir comple@@ x@@ ity , their s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ cation , is something to really mar@@ vel at , and I think it &apos;s really the sc@@ and@@ al of the H@@ um@@ an G@@ en@@ ome Pro@@ je@@ ct ."
"You know , we went into it thinking , 4@@ 0,000 or 5@@ 0,000 human gen@@ es and we came out with only 2@@ 3@@ ,000 ."
"J@@ ust to give you gro@@ un@@ ds for com@@ par@@ is@@ on , ri@@ ce : 3@@ 5@@ ,000 gen@@ es ."
So who &apos;s the more s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated species ?
"Well , we &apos;re all equ@@ ally s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated ."
"We &apos;ve been ev@@ ol@@ ving just as long , just along different pa@@ ths ."
"So , cu@@ re for self-@@ import@@ ance , way to sort of make us feel the D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ an idea ."
"And that &apos;s really what I do as a wri@@ ter , as a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler , is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually help us think e@@ co@@ logi@@ cally ."
"Now , the other use of this is prac@@ tical ."
"And I &apos;m going to take you to a far@@ m right now , because I used this idea to develo@@ p my under@@ standing of the food system and what I learned , in fact , is that we are all , now , being m@@ ani@@ pu@@ lated by cor@@ n ."
"And the talk you heard about e@@ th@@ an@@ ol ear@@ lie@@ r today , to me , is the fin@@ al tri@@ um@@ ph of cor@@ n over good sense . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It is part of cor@@ n &apos;s s@@ che@@ me for world dom@@ in@@ ation . ( Laughter )"
"And you will see , the amount of cor@@ n plan@@ ted this year will be up dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally from last year and there will be that much more ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at because we &apos;ve decided e@@ th@@ an@@ ol is going to help us ."
"So it hel@@ ped me understand indu@@ stri@@ al agri@@ culture , which of course is a C@@ ar@@ te@@ si@@ an system ."
"It &apos;s based on this idea that we b@@ end other species to our will and that we are in char@@ ge , and that we create these fac@@ tor@@ ies and we have these technologi@@ cal in@@ pu@@ ts and we get the food out of it or the fu@@ el or whatever we want ."
Let me take you to a very different kind of far@@ m .
This is a far@@ m in the S@@ h@@ en@@ an@@ do@@ ah V@@ al@@ ley of V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
"I went looking for a far@@ m where these ideas about looking at things from the species &apos; point of view are actually im@@ ple@@ men@@ ted , and I found it in a man . The farm@@ er &apos;s name is Jo@@ el S@@ al@@ at@@ in ."
"And I spent a week as an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce on his far@@ m , and I took away from this some of the most hop@@ e@@ ful news about our relation@@ ship to nature that I &apos;ve ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature ."
"And that is this : the far@@ m is called P@@ ol@@ y@@ face , which means ..."
"@@ the idea is he &apos;s got six different species of animals , as well as some plan@@ ts , grow@@ ing in this very el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate sym@@ bi@@ oti@@ c ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ement ."
"It &apos;s per@@ m@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , those of you who know a little bit about this , such that the c@@ ow@@ s and the pi@@ gs and the sh@@ e@@ ep and the tur@@ ke@@ ys and the ..."
what else does he have ?
"A@@ ll the six different species — ra@@ b@@ bi@@ ts , actually — are all perform@@ ing e@@ co@@ logi@@ cal ser@@ vi@@ ces for one another , such that the man@@ ure of one is the lu@@ n@@ ch for the other and they take care of pe@@ sts for one another ."
"It &apos;s a very el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate and beautiful dance , but I &apos;m going to just give you a clo@@ se@@ -@@ up on one piece of it , and that is the relation@@ ship between his cat@@ tle and his chi@@ ck@@ ens , his la@@ ying h@@ ens ."
"And I &apos;ll show you , if you take this appro@@ ach , what you get , OK ?"
"And this is a lot more than grow@@ ing food , as you &apos;ll see ; this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zer@@ o@@ -@@ su@@ m noti@@ on , the C@@ ar@@ te@@ si@@ an idea that either nature &apos;s win@@ ning or we &apos;re win@@ ning , and that for us to get what we want , nature is di@@ min@@ i@@ shed ."
"So , one day , cat@@ tle in a p@@ en ."
"The only technology inv@@ olved here is this che@@ a@@ p electri@@ c f@@ en@@ cing : relati@@ vely new , ho@@ o@@ ked to a car bat@@ tery ; even I could car@@ ry a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ -@@ ac@@ re pad@@ do@@ ck , set it up in 15 minutes ."
"C@@ ow@@ s gra@@ ze one day . They move , OK ?"
"They gra@@ ze everything down , inten@@ sive gra@@ z@@ ing ."
"He wa@@ its three days , and then we tow@@ ed in something called the E@@ gg@@ mo@@ bi@@ le ."
The E@@ gg@@ mo@@ bi@@ le is a very ri@@ c@@ ke@@ ty con@@ tra@@ ption — it looks like a pra@@ ir@@ ie scho@@ on@@ er made out of bo@@ ar@@ ds — but it h@@ ous@@ es 3@@ 50 chi@@ ck@@ ens .
"He tow@@ s this into the pad@@ do@@ ck three days later and open@@ s the g@@ ang@@ plan@@ k , turns them down , and 3@@ 50 h@@ ens come stre@@ am@@ ing down the g@@ ang@@ plan@@ k — clu@@ c@@ king , go@@ s@@ si@@ ping as chi@@ ck@@ ens will — and they make a be@@ el@@ ine for the c@@ ow pat@@ ties ."
"And what they &apos;re doing is very interesting : they &apos;re di@@ gg@@ ing through the c@@ ow pat@@ ties for the mag@@ got@@ s , the gru@@ b@@ s , the lar@@ v@@ a@@ e of fl@@ ies ."
"And the reason he &apos;s wai@@ ted three days is because he know@@ s that on the f@@ our@@ th day or the fi@@ f@@ th day , those lar@@ v@@ a@@ e will h@@ at@@ ch and he &apos;ll have a huge f@@ ly problem ."
But he wa@@ its that long to gro@@ w them as big and ju@@ i@@ cy and ta@@ sty as he can because they are the chi@@ ck@@ ens &apos; fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te form of prote@@ in .
"So the chi@@ ck@@ ens do their kind of little bre@@ ak@@ dance and they &apos;re p@@ us@@ h@@ ing around the man@@ ure to get at the gru@@ b@@ s , and in the process they &apos;re sp@@ re@@ ading the man@@ ure out ."
V@@ ery us@@ e@@ ful second e@@ co@@ system ser@@ vice .
"And third , while they &apos;re in this pad@@ do@@ ck they are , of course , de@@ fe@@ c@@ ating m@@ ad@@ ly and their very ni@@ tro@@ gen@@ ous man@@ ure is fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ing this fie@@ ld ."
"They then move out to the next one , and in the course of just a few weeks , the gra@@ ss just en@@ ters this b@@ la@@ ze of grow@@ th ."
"And within four or five weeks , he can do it again ."
"He can gra@@ ze again , he can cut , he can bring in another species , like the l@@ am@@ b@@ s , or he can make ha@@ y for the win@@ ter ."
"Now , I want you to just look really close up on@@ to what &apos;s happened there ."
"So , it &apos;s a very produ@@ ctive system ."
"And what I need to tell you is that on 100 ac@@ res he gets 4@@ 0,000 po@@ un@@ ds of be@@ e@@ f ; 3@@ 0,000 po@@ un@@ ds of por@@ k ; 2@@ 5@@ ,000 do@@ z@@ en e@@ g@@ gs ; 20@@ ,000 bro@@ il@@ ers ; 1@@ ,000 tur@@ ke@@ ys ; 1@@ ,000 ra@@ b@@ bi@@ ts — an im@@ men@@ se amount of food ."
"You know , you hear , &quot; &quot; C@@ an organi@@ c fe@@ ed the world ? &quot; &quot; Well , look how much food you can produ@@ ce on 100 ac@@ res if you do this kind of ..."
"@@ again , give each species what it wan@@ ts , let it realize its de@@ si@@ res , its physi@@ ologi@@ cal di@@ st@@ in@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess ."
P@@ u@@ t that in play .
"But look at it from the point of view of the gra@@ ss , now ."
What happens to the gra@@ ss when you do this ?
"When a ru@@ min@@ ant gra@@ z@@ es gra@@ ss , the gra@@ ss is cut from this he@@ ight to this he@@ ight , and it im@@ medi@@ ately does something very interesting ."
"A@@ ny one of you who gar@@ den@@ s know@@ s that there is something called the ro@@ ot@@ -@@ sho@@ ot r@@ ati@@ o , and plan@@ ts need to keep the ro@@ ot mas@@ s in some rou@@ gh bal@@ ance with the lea@@ f mas@@ s to be happy ."
"So when they lo@@ se a lot of lea@@ f mas@@ s , they shed ro@@ ots ; they kind of ca@@ u@@ ter@@ i@@ ze them and the ro@@ ots die ."
"And the species in the so@@ il go to work basically ch@@ ew@@ ing through those ro@@ ots , de@@ com@@ pos@@ ing them — the ear@@ th@@ wor@@ ms , the fun@@ gi , the bac@@ ter@@ ia — and the resul@@ t is new so@@ il ."
This is how so@@ il is created .
It &apos;s created from the bot@@ tom up .
"This is how the pra@@ ir@@ ies were built , the relation@@ ship between bi@@ son and gra@@ s@@ ses ."
"And what I realized when I under@@ sto@@ od this — and if you ask Jo@@ el S@@ al@@ at@@ in what he is , he &apos;ll tell you he &apos;s not a chi@@ ck@@ en farm@@ er , he &apos;s not a sh@@ e@@ ep farm@@ er , he &apos;s not a cat@@ tle ran@@ ch@@ er ; he &apos;s a gra@@ ss farm@@ er , because gra@@ ss is really the ke@@ yst@@ one species of such a system — is that , if you think about it , this completely con@@ tra@@ di@@ cts the tra@@ gi@@ c idea of nature we h@@ old in our he@@ ads , which is that for us to get what we want , nature is di@@ min@@ i@@ shed ."
"M@@ ore for us , less for nature ."
"H@@ ere , all this food comes off this far@@ m , and at the end of the se@@ as@@ on there is actually more so@@ il , more fer@@ ti@@ lity and more bi@@ od@@ i@@ versity ."
It &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ ably hop@@ e@@ ful thing to do .
There are a lot of farm@@ ers doing this today .
"This is well be@@ y@@ ond organi@@ c agri@@ culture , which is still a C@@ ar@@ te@@ si@@ an system , more or less ."
"And what it tel@@ ls you is that if you beg@@ in to take ac@@ coun@@ t of other species , take ac@@ coun@@ t of the so@@ il , that even with nothing more than this perspe@@ cti@@ v@@ al idea — because there is no technology inv@@ olved here ex@@ cept for those f@@ ences , which are so che@@ a@@ p they could be all over Africa in no time — that we can take the food we need from the Earth and actually he@@ al the Earth in the process ."
"This is a way to re@@ anim@@ ate the world , and that &apos;s what &apos;s so exci@@ ting about this perspe@@ ctive ."
"When we really beg@@ in to feel D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n &apos;s in@@ si@@ ghts in our b@@ ones , the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very hop@@ e@@ ful about ."
Thank you very much .
Ty@@ ler De@@ war : The way I feel right now is that all of the other spe@@ ak@@ ers have said exactly what I wanted to say .
( Laughter ) And it seem@@ s that the only thing left for me to say is to th@@ ank you all for your kin@@ d@@ ness .
"T@@ D : But maybe in the sp@@ ir@@ it of ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ating the kin@@ d@@ ness of you all , I could share with you a little story about myself ."
"T@@ D : F@@ ro@@ m the time I was very young , on@@ ward , I was given a lot of different respon@@ si@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies , and it always seem@@ ed to me , when I was young , that everything was la@@ id out before me ."
All of the pl@@ ans for me were already made .
"I was given the clo@@ the@@ s that I needed to we@@ ar and told where I needed to be , given these very pre@@ ci@@ ous and ho@@ ly looking ro@@ be@@ s to we@@ ar , with the under@@ standing that it was something s@@ ac@@ red or important ."
"T@@ D : But before that kind of form@@ al li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le happened for me , I was living in e@@ ast@@ er@@ n Ti@@ be@@ t with my family ."
"And when I was seven years old , all of a sud@@ den , a sear@@ ch par@@ ty ar@@ ri@@ ved at my home ."
"They were looking the next K@@ ar@@ ma@@ p@@ a , and I noti@@ ced they were talking to my mo@@ m and d@@ ad , and the news came to me that they were tel@@ ling me that I was the K@@ ar@@ ma@@ p@@ a ."
"And these days , people ask me a lot , how did that feel ."
"H@@ ow did that feel when they came and whi@@ sk@@ ed you away , and your li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le completely changed ?"
"And what I mo@@ st@@ ly say is that , at that time , it was a pretty interesting idea to me ."
I thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with .
"( Laughter ) T@@ D : But it didn &apos;t turn out to be so fun and en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ining , as I thought it would have been ."
I was plac@@ ed in a pretty stri@@ ct@@ ly contro@@ l@@ led environment .
"And im@@ medi@@ ately , a lot of different respon@@ si@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies , in terms of my education and so for@@ th , were he@@ ap@@ ed upo@@ n me ."
"I was se@@ par@@ ated , lar@@ ge@@ ly , from my family , inclu@@ ding my mother and father ."
"I didn &apos;t have have many per@@ s@@ onal friends to spend time with , but I was expe@@ cted to per@@ form these pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed du@@ ties ."
So it turned out that my fan@@ t@@ asy about an en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ining life of being the K@@ ar@@ ma@@ p@@ a wasn &apos;t going to come true .
"It more felt to be the case to me that I was being tre@@ ated like a stat@@ ue , and I was to si@@ t in one place like a stat@@ ue would ."
"T@@ D : Ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , I felt that , even though I &apos;ve been se@@ par@@ ated from my lo@@ ved ones — and , of course , now I &apos;m even f@@ ur@@ ther away ."
"When I was 14 , I es@@ ca@@ ped from Ti@@ be@@ t and became even f@@ ur@@ ther re@@ mo@@ ved from my mother and father , my relati@@ ves , my friends and my hom@@ el@@ and ."
"But ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , there &apos;s no real sense of se@@ par@@ ation from me in my heart , in terms of the love that I feel for these people ."
"I feel , still , a very stron@@ g conne@@ ction of love for all of these people and for the land ."
"T@@ D : And I still do get to keep in tou@@ ch with my mother and father , al@@ be@@ it in@@ fre@@ qu@@ ently ."
I talk to my mother once in a blue mo@@ on on the tele@@ phone .
"And my experience is that , when I &apos;m talking to her , with every second that pas@@ ses during our convers@@ ation , the feeling of love that bin@@ ds us is br@@ ing@@ ing us clo@@ s@@ er and clo@@ s@@ er together ."
T@@ D : So those were just a few re@@ mar@@ ks about my per@@ s@@ onal back@@ ground .
"And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you , in terms of ideas , I think it &apos;s wonderful to have a situ@@ ation like this , where so many people from different back@@ gro@@ un@@ ds and places can come together , ex@@ change their ideas and form relation@@ ships of frien@@ d@@ ship with each other ."
"And I think that &apos;s sym@@ bo@@ li@@ c of what we &apos;re seeing in the world in gener@@ al , that the world is be@@ coming s@@ mal@@ ler and s@@ mal@@ ler , and that all of the pe@@ op@@ les in the world are en@@ jo@@ ying more opportuni@@ ties for conne@@ ction ."
"That &apos;s wonderful , but we should also remember that we should have a si@@ mi@@ lar process happening on the inside ."
"A@@ long with ou@@ tw@@ ard develo@@ pment and incre@@ ase of opportunity , there should be in@@ ward develo@@ pment and de@@ e@@ pen@@ ing of our heart conne@@ ctions as well as our ou@@ tw@@ ard conne@@ ctions ."
So we spo@@ ke and we heard some about design this week .
I think that it &apos;s important for us to remember that we need to keep p@@ us@@ h@@ ing forward on the en@@ de@@ av@@ or of the design of the heart .
"We heard a lot about technology this week , and it &apos;s important for us to remember to inv@@ est a lot of our energy in impro@@ ving the technology of the heart ."
"T@@ D : So , even though I &apos;m some@@ what happy about the wonderful develo@@ p@@ ments that are happening in the world , still , I feel a sense of im@@ pe@@ di@@ ment , when it comes to the ability that we have to conne@@ ct with each other on a hear@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ heart , or a min@@ d-@@ to@@ -@@ mind , level ."
I feel that there are some things that are getting in the way .
"T@@ C : My relation@@ ship to this con@@ cept of hear@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ heart conne@@ ction , or min@@ d-@@ to@@ -@@ mind conne@@ ction , is an interesting one , because , as a spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al lea@@ der , I &apos;m always at@@ tem@@ p@@ ting to open my heart to others and of@@ f@@ er myself up for hear@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ heart and min@@ d-@@ to@@ -@@ mind conne@@ ctions in a gen@@ u@@ ine way with other people , but at the same time , I &apos;ve always been ad@@ vi@@ sed that I need to em@@ p@@ ha@@ size inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence over the hear@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ heart conne@@ ctions , because , being someone in a posi@@ tion like m@@ ine , if I don &apos;t re@@ ly pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly on inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence , then something d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous may happen to me ."
So it &apos;s an interesting par@@ ad@@ o@@ x at play there .
"But I had a really stri@@ king experience once , when a group from Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan came to visi@@ t me , and we had a really interesting convers@@ ation ."
"T@@ D : So we en@@ ded up talking about the B@@ ami@@ y@@ an Bu@@ dd@@ has , which , as you know , were de@@ stro@@ yed some years ago in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan ."
But the basi@@ s of our convers@@ ation was the different appro@@ ach to spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ ality on the part of the M@@ us@@ li@@ m and Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ st tra@@ di@@ tions .
"O@@ f course , in M@@ us@@ li@@ m , because of the teach@@ ings around the con@@ cept of i@@ dol@@ at@@ ry , you don &apos;t find as many physi@@ cal re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ations of di@@ v@@ in@@ ity or of spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al li@@ ber@@ ation as you do in the Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ st tra@@ di@@ tion , where , of course , there are many stat@@ u@@ es of the Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ a that are high@@ ly re@@ vered ."
"So , we were talking about the differ@@ ences between the tra@@ di@@ tions and what many people per@@ cei@@ ved as the tra@@ ge@@ dy of the de@@ stru@@ ction of the B@@ ami@@ y@@ an Bu@@ dd@@ has , but I of@@ fer@@ ed the su@@ gg@@ esti@@ on that per@@ haps we could look at this in a posi@@ tive way ."
"What we saw in the de@@ stru@@ ction of the B@@ ami@@ y@@ an Bu@@ dd@@ has was the de@@ ple@@ tion of matter , some so@@ li@@ d sub@@ stance fal@@ ling down and dis@@ inte@@ gr@@ ating ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe we could look at that to be more si@@ mi@@ lar to the fal@@ ling of the B@@ er@@ li@@ n W@@ all , where a di@@ vi@@ de that had ke@@ pt two typ@@ es of people a@@ part had col@@ lap@@ sed and open@@ ed up a door for f@@ ur@@ ther communi@@ cation ."
"So I think that , in this way , it &apos;s always possible for us to der@@ i@@ ve something posi@@ tive that can help us understand one another better ."
"T@@ D : So , with re@@ g@@ ard to the develo@@ pment that we &apos;ve been talking about here at this con@@ fer@@ ence , I really feel that the develo@@ pment that we make sh@@ ouldn &apos;t create a f@@ ur@@ ther bur@@ den for us as human be@@ ings , but should be used to impro@@ ve our fundam@@ ent@@ al li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le of how we live in the world ."
"T@@ D : O@@ f course , I re@@ jo@@ ice in the develo@@ pment and the grow@@ th and the ri@@ se of the no@@ ble land of Indi@@ a , the great country of Indi@@ a , but at the same time , I think , as some of us have ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ed , we need to be aw@@ are that some aspe@@ cts of this ri@@ se are coming at the cost of the very ground on which we stand ."
"So , as we are clim@@ b@@ ing the t@@ ree , some of the things that we &apos;re doing in order to clim@@ b the t@@ ree are actually under@@ min@@ ing the t@@ ree &apos;s very ro@@ ot ."
"And so , what I think it comes down to is a question of , not only having information of what &apos;s going on , but pa@@ ying at@@ ten@@ tion to that and le@@ tting that shi@@ ft our moti@@ vation to become more sin@@ c@@ ere and gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely posi@@ tive ."
"We have hear , this week , about the hor@@ ri@@ ble su@@ f@@ fer@@ ings , for example , that so many women of the world are en@@ during da@@ y@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day ."
"We have that information , but what often happens to us is that we don &apos;t really cho@@ ose to pay at@@ ten@@ tion to it ."
We don &apos;t really cho@@ ose to al@@ low that to cause there to be a shi@@ ft in our hear@@ ts .
So I think the way forward for the world — one that will bring the pat@@ h of ou@@ ter develo@@ pment in har@@ mon@@ y with the real ro@@ ot of happ@@ iness — is that we al@@ low the information that we have to really make a change in our heart .
"T@@ D : So I think that sin@@ c@@ ere moti@@ vation is very important for our future wel@@ l-@@ being , or de@@ ep sense of wel@@ l-@@ being as hum@@ ans , and I think that means sin@@ king in to whatever it is you &apos;re doing now ."
"Wh@@ atever work you &apos;re trying to do now to b@@ en@@ ef@@ it the world , sin@@ k into that , get a full ta@@ ste of that ."
"T@@ D : So , since we &apos;ve been here this week , we &apos;ve taken mi@@ llions of bre@@ a@@ ths , colle@@ cti@@ vely , and per@@ haps we ha@@ ven &apos;t wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed any course chang@@ es happening in our lives , but we often mi@@ ss the very sub@@ tle chang@@ es ."
"And I think that sometimes we develo@@ p gr@@ and con@@ cep@@ ts of what happ@@ iness might look like for us , but that , if we pay at@@ ten@@ tion , we can see that there are little sym@@ b@@ ols of happ@@ iness in every bre@@ ath that we take ."
"T@@ D : So , every one of you who has come here is so tal@@ en@@ ted , and you have so much to of@@ f@@ er to the world , I think it would be a good not@@ e to con@@ clu@@ de on then to just take a moment to ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate how for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate we are to have come together in this way and ex@@ changed ideas and really form a stron@@ g as@@ pi@@ r@@ ation and energy within ourselves that we will take the good that has come from this con@@ fer@@ ence , the mom@@ entu@@ m , the posi@@ ti@@ vity , and we will sp@@ read that and pl@@ ant it in all of the cor@@ n@@ ers of the world ."
H@@ is H@@ ol@@ iness the K@@ ar@@ ma@@ p@@ a : T@@ om@@ or@@ row is my T@@ al@@ k .
"T@@ D : L@@ ak@@ sh@@ mi has worked incredi@@ bly hard , even in in@@ vi@@ ting me , let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen , and I was some@@ what resi@@ st@@ ant at times , and I was also very ner@@ v@@ ous throu@@ gh@@ out this week ."
"I was feeling under the we@@ a@@ ther and di@@ z@@ zy and so for@@ th , and people would ask me , why ."
"I would tell them , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s because I have to talk tom@@ or@@ row . &quot; &quot; And so L@@ ak@@ sh@@ mi had to put up with me through all of that , but I very much ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate the opportunity she &apos;s given me to be here ."
"And to you , everyone , th@@ ank you very much ."
( Applause ) H@@ H : Thank you very much . ( Applause )
So I want to take you on a tri@@ p to an al@@ ie@@ n world .
"And it &apos;s not a tri@@ p that requi@@ res li@@ gh@@ t-@@ years of tra@@ vel , but it &apos;s to a place where it &apos;s de@@ fin@@ ed by light ."
So it &apos;s a lit@@ t@@ le@@ -@@ ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light .
I &apos;ve spent most of my car@@ e@@ er stu@@ dy@@ ing this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cen@@ ce .
I study it because I think under@@ standing it is cri@@ tical to under@@ standing life in the ocean where most bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cen@@ ce oc@@ cur@@ s .
I also use it as a to@@ ol for vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ ing and trac@@ king pol@@ lu@@ tion .
But mo@@ st@@ ly I &apos;m en@@ tran@@ ced by it .
"S@@ in@@ ce my my first di@@ ve in a de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ di@@ ving sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , when I went down and turned out the li@@ ghts and saw the fi@@ re@@ works disp@@ la@@ ys , I &apos;ve been a bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cen@@ ce j@@ un@@ k@@ y ."
"But I would come back from those di@@ ves and try to share the experience with words , and they were tot@@ ally in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate to the t@@ ask ."
I needed some way to share the experience dire@@ ct@@ ly .
And the first time I figu@@ red out that way was in this little sing@@ le@@ -@@ person sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble called De@@ ep R@@ over .
"This next video cli@@ p , you &apos;re going to see how we sti@@ mu@@ lated the bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cen@@ ce ."
And the first thing you &apos;re going to see is a tran@@ se@@ ct scre@@ en that is about a me@@ ter across .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : In front of the su@@ b , a m@@ ess scre@@ en will come into cont@@ act with the so@@ f@@ t-@@ bod@@ ied cre@@ at@@ ures of the de@@ ep se@@ a ."
"Wi@@ th the su@@ b &apos;s li@@ ghts s@@ wit@@ ched off , it is possible to see their bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cen@@ ce — the light produ@@ ced when they col@@ li@@ de with the m@@ es@@ h ."
This is the first time it has ever been recor@@ ded .
E@@ di@@ th Wi@@ d@@ der : So I recor@@ ded that with an inten@@ si@@ f@@ ied video cam@@ era that has about the sen@@ si@@ ti@@ vity of the fully dar@@ k@@ -@@ ad@@ ap@@ ted human ey@@ e .
Wh@@ ich means that really is what you would see if you took a di@@ ve in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble .
"But just to try to pro@@ ve that fact to you , I &apos;ve brought along some bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent plan@@ kt@@ on in what is un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly a fo@@ ol@@ har@@ dy at@@ tem@@ pt at a live de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation ."
"( Laughter ) So , if we could have the li@@ ghts down and have it as dar@@ k in here as possible , I have a f@@ las@@ k that has bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent plan@@ kt@@ on in it ."
"And you &apos;ll not@@ e there &apos;s no light coming from them right now , either because they &apos;re de@@ ad — ( Laughter ) or because I need to st@@ ir them up in some way for you to see what bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cen@@ ce really looks like ."
( G@@ as@@ ps ) O@@ op@@ s . S@@ or@@ ry .
( Laughter ) I spend most of my time working in the dar@@ k ; I &apos;m used to that .
O@@ kay .
"So that light was made by a bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent din@@ of@@ l@@ ag@@ el@@ l@@ ate , a sing@@ le@@ -@@ cel@@ led al@@ ga ."
So why would a sing@@ le@@ -@@ cel@@ led al@@ ga need to be able to produ@@ ce light ?
"Well , it uses it to def@@ end itself from its pre@@ d@@ at@@ ors ."
The f@@ las@@ h is like a scre@@ am for help .
"It &apos;s what &apos;s known as a bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent bur@@ gl@@ ar al@@ ar@@ m , and just like the al@@ ar@@ m on your car or your house , it &apos;s me@@ ant to c@@ ast un@@ wanted at@@ ten@@ tion on@@ to the in@@ tru@@ der , ther@@ e@@ by either le@@ ading to his cap@@ ture or sc@@ aring him away ."
"There &apos;s a lot of animals that use this tri@@ ck , for example this black dra@@ g@@ on@@ fish ."
It &apos;s got a light or@@ g@@ an under its ey@@ e .
It &apos;s got a ch@@ in bar@@ be@@ l .
"It &apos;s got a lot of other light or@@ g@@ ans you can &apos;t see , but you &apos;ll see in here in a minu@@ te ."
"So we had to ch@@ ase this in the sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble for quite some@@ time , because the top speed of this fish is one k@@ not , which was the top speed of the sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble ."
"But it was wor@@ th it , because we ca@@ u@@ ght it in a spe@@ cial cap@@ ture de@@ vice , brought it up into the la@@ b on the ship , and then everything on this fish li@@ ghts up ."
It &apos;s un@@ belie@@ v@@ able .
The light or@@ g@@ ans under the eyes are f@@ las@@ h@@ ing .
That ch@@ in bar@@ be@@ l is f@@ las@@ h@@ ing .
"It &apos;s got light or@@ g@@ ans on its be@@ lly that are f@@ las@@ h@@ ing , f@@ in li@@ ghts ."
It &apos;s a scre@@ am for help ; it &apos;s me@@ ant to at@@ trac@@ t at@@ ten@@ tion .
It &apos;s ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
And you nor@@ m@@ ally don &apos;t get to see this because we &apos;ve ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ed the lu@@ min@@ es@@ cen@@ ce when we bring them up in ne@@ ts .
There &apos;s other ways you can def@@ end yourself with light .
"For example , this sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p rele@@ ases its bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent chemi@@ cal@@ s into the water just the way a squ@@ id or an o@@ ct@@ op@@ us would rele@@ ase an in@@ k cl@@ ou@@ d ."
This b@@ lin@@ ds or di@@ strac@@ ts the pre@@ d@@ ator .
This little squ@@ id is called the fi@@ re sho@@ ot@@ er because of its ability to do this .
"Now it may look like a ta@@ sty mor@@ se@@ l , or a pi@@ g &apos;s head with w@@ ings — ( Laughter ) but if it &apos;s att@@ ac@@ ked , it pu@@ ts out a bar@@ ra@@ ge of light — in fact , a bar@@ ra@@ ge of ph@@ ot@@ on tor@@ pe@@ does ."
I just bar@@ ely got the li@@ ghts out in time for you to be able to see those g@@ ob@@ s of light hi@@ tting the tran@@ se@@ ct scre@@ en and then just gl@@ ow@@ ing .
It &apos;s ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
So there &apos;s a lot of animals in the open ocean — most of them that make light .
"And we have a pretty good idea , for most of them , why ."
"They use it for fin@@ ding food , for at@@ trac@@ ting mat@@ es , for def@@ ending against pre@@ d@@ at@@ ors ."
"But when you get down to the bot@@ tom of the ocean , that &apos;s where things get really str@@ ange ."
"And some of these animals are probably in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation for the things you saw in &quot; &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; &quot; but you don &apos;t have to tra@@ vel to P@@ and@@ or@@ a to see them ."
They &apos;re things like this .
"This is a g@@ ol@@ den cor@@ al , a bus@@ h ."
It grow@@ s very s@@ low@@ ly .
"In fact , it &apos;s thought that some of these are as much as 3@@ ,000 years old , which is one reason that bot@@ tom t@@ raw@@ ling should not be allow@@ ed ."
The other reason is this amazing bus@@ h gl@@ ow@@ s .
"So if you br@@ us@@ h up against it , any place you br@@ us@@ h@@ ed against it , you get this tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling blu@@ e-@@ green light that &apos;s just bre@@ a@@ th@@ taking ."
And you see things like this .
This looks like something out of a D@@ r. Se@@ us@@ s book — just all man@@ ner of cre@@ at@@ ures all over this thing .
And these are f@@ ly@@ tra@@ p an@@ em@@ ones .
"Now if you po@@ ke it , it pul@@ ls in its t@@ ent@@ ac@@ les ."
"But if you keep po@@ king it , it star@@ ts to produ@@ ce light ."
And it actually en@@ ds up looking like a gal@@ ax@@ y .
"It produ@@ ces these str@@ ings of light , pre@@ sum@@ ably as some form of def@@ en@@ se ."
There are star@@ fish that can make light .
And there are bri@@ t@@ tle star@@ s that produ@@ ce b@@ ands of light that dance along their ar@@ ms .
"This looks like a pl@@ ant , but it &apos;s actually an ani@@ mal ."
And it an@@ ch@@ ors itself in the s@@ and by b@@ low@@ ing up a bal@@ lo@@ on on the end of its sto@@ ck .
"So it can actually h@@ old itself in very stron@@ g cur@@ r@@ ents , as you see here ."
"But if we colle@@ ct it very g@@ ently , and we bring it up into the la@@ b and just squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze it at the b@@ ase of the sto@@ ck , it produ@@ ces this light that pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ates from stem to the p@@ lu@@ me , chang@@ ing color as it goes , from green to blue ."
Col@@ ori@@ z@@ ation and sound effe@@ cts ad@@ ded for you vie@@ w@@ ing ple@@ as@@ ure .
( Laughter ) But we have no idea why it does that .
Here &apos;s another one . This is also a se@@ a p@@ en .
It &apos;s got a bri@@ t@@ tle st@@ ar hi@@ t@@ ching a ri@@ de .
It &apos;s a green sa@@ ber of light .
"And like the one you just saw , it can produ@@ ce these as b@@ ands of light ."
"So if I squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze the b@@ ase , the b@@ ands go from b@@ ase to ti@@ p ."
"If I squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze the ti@@ p , they go from ti@@ p to b@@ ase ."
So what do you think happens if you squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze it in the mi@@ ddle ?
( G@@ as@@ ps ) I &apos;d be very interested in your the@@ or@@ ies about what that &apos;s about .
"( Laughter ) So there &apos;s a language of light in the de@@ ep ocean , and we &apos;re just beginning to understand it , and one way we &apos;re going about that is we &apos;re imi@@ t@@ ating a lot of these disp@@ la@@ ys ."
This is an op@@ tical lu@@ re that I &apos;ve used .
We call it the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish .
It &apos;s just 16 blue L@@ E@@ D@@ s that we can program to do different typ@@ es of disp@@ la@@ ys .
"And we view it with a cam@@ era system I develo@@ ped called E@@ ye@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ Se@@ a that uses far red light that &apos;s in@@ visi@@ ble to most animals , so it &apos;s u@@ no@@ b@@ tru@@ sive ."
So I just want to show you some of the respon@@ ses we &apos;ve e@@ li@@ ci@@ ted from animals in the de@@ ep se@@ a .
So the cam@@ era &apos;s black and white .
It &apos;s not high-@@ re@@ solution .
And what you &apos;re seeing here is a ba@@ it box with a bu@@ n@@ ch of — like the co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach@@ es of the ocean — there are i@@ so@@ po@@ ds all over it .
And right in the front is the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish .
"And when it star@@ ts f@@ las@@ h@@ ing , it &apos;s just going to be one of the L@@ E@@ D@@ s that &apos;s f@@ las@@ h@@ ing very f@@ ast ."
"But as so@@ on as it star@@ ts to f@@ las@@ h — and it &apos;s going to look big , because it blo@@ oms on the cam@@ era — I want you to look right here ."
There &apos;s something small there that respon@@ ds .
We &apos;re talking to something .
"It looks like a little of str@@ ing pe@@ ar@@ ls basically — in fact , three str@@ ings of pe@@ ar@@ ls ."
And this was very consi@@ st@@ ent .
"This was in the B@@ a@@ ha@@ m@@ as at about 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et ."
"We basically have a ch@@ at room going on here , because once it gets started , everybody &apos;s talking ."
And I think this is actually a sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p that &apos;s rele@@ as@@ ing its bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent chemi@@ cal@@ s into the water .
"But the cool thing is , we &apos;re talking to it ."
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re saying .
"P@@ er@@ son@@ ally , I think it &apos;s something se@@ x@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) And then finally , I want to show you some respon@@ ses that we recor@@ ded with the world &apos;s first de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ se@@ a we@@ b@@ c@@ am , which we had in@@ stal@@ led in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey C@@ any@@ on last year ."
We &apos;ve only just be@@ gu@@ n to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze all of this data .
"This is going to be a gl@@ ow@@ ing source first , which is like bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent bac@@ ter@@ ia ."
And it is an op@@ tical cu@@ e that there &apos;s car@@ ri@@ on on the bot@@ tom of the ocean .
"So this s@@ ca@@ ven@@ ger comes in , which is a gi@@ ant si@@ x@@ gi@@ ll sh@@ ar@@ k ."
"And I can &apos;t c@@ la@@ im for sure that the op@@ tical source brought it in , because there &apos;s ba@@ it right there ."
"But if it had been fol@@ low@@ ing the od@@ or p@@ lu@@ me , it would have come in from the other dire@@ ction ."
And it does actually se@@ em to be trying to e@@ at the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish .
That &apos;s a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ -@@ long gi@@ ant si@@ x@@ gi@@ ll sh@@ ar@@ k .
"O@@ kay , so this next one is from the we@@ b@@ c@@ am , and it &apos;s going to be this p@@ in@@ whe@@ el disp@@ l@@ ay ."
And this is a bur@@ gl@@ ar al@@ ar@@ m .
"And that was a H@@ um@@ b@@ ol@@ d@@ t squ@@ id , a ju@@ v@@ eni@@ le H@@ um@@ b@@ ol@@ d@@ t squ@@ id , about three fe@@ et long ."
"This is at 3@@ ,000 fe@@ et in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey C@@ any@@ on ."
"But if it &apos;s a bur@@ gl@@ ar al@@ ar@@ m , you wouldn &apos;t expe@@ ct it to att@@ ack the je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish dire@@ ct@@ ly ."
It &apos;s sup@@ posed to be att@@ ac@@ king what &apos;s att@@ ac@@ king the je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish .
But we did see a bu@@ n@@ ch of respon@@ ses like this .
This guy is a little more con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ative .
"&quot; &quot; H@@ ey , wa@@ it a minu@@ te ."
There &apos;s sup@@ posed to be something else there . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s thinking about it .
But he &apos;s per@@ si@@ st@@ ent .
He ke@@ e@@ ps coming back .
"And then he goes away for a few secon@@ ds to think about it some more , and thin@@ ks , &quot; Ma@@ ybe if I come in from a different ang@@ le . &quot;"
( Laughter ) N@@ op@@ e .
"So we are star@@ ting to get a hand@@ le on this , but only just the begin@@ n@@ ings ."
We need more eyes on the process .
"So if any of you ever get a ch@@ ance to take a di@@ ve in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , by all means , clim@@ b in and take the p@@ lu@@ n@@ ge ."
"This is something that should be on everybody &apos;s bu@@ ck@@ et li@@ st , because we live on an ocean planet ."
"M@@ ore than 90 percent , 9@@ 9 percent , of the living space on our planet is ocean ."
"It &apos;s a mag@@ i@@ cal place fil@@ led with bre@@ a@@ th@@ taking light shows and bi@@ zar@@ re and won@@ d@@ rou@@ s cre@@ at@@ ures , al@@ ie@@ n life form@@ s that you don &apos;t have to tra@@ vel to another planet to see ."
"But if you do take the p@@ lu@@ n@@ ge , ple@@ ase remember to turn out the li@@ ghts ."
"But I war@@ n you , it &apos;s ad@@ di@@ ctive ."
Thank you .

What is bio@@ energy ? Bi@@ o@@ energy is not e@@ th@@ an@@ ol .
"B@@ i@@ o@@ energy isn &apos;t global war@@ ming . Bi@@ o@@ energy is something which seem@@ s coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive . Bi@@ o@@ energy is oil . It &apos;s gas . It &apos;s co@@ al . And part of building that bri@@ dge to the future , to the point where we can actually see the oce@@ ans in a r@@ ational way , or put up these ge@@ o@@ -@@ sp@@ ati@@ al or@@ bi@@ ts that will t@@ wi@@ r@@ l or do micro@@ wa@@ ves or stuff , is going to de@@ p@@ end on how we understand bio@@ energy and man@@ age it . And to do that , you really have to look first at agri@@ culture ."
"So we &apos;ve been plan@@ ting stuff for 1@@ 1@@ ,000 years . And in the meas@@ ure that we pl@@ ant stuff , what we learn from agri@@ culture is you &apos;ve got to deal with pe@@ sts , you &apos;ve got to deal with all typ@@ es of aw@@ ful things , you &apos;ve got to cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ate stuff . In the meas@@ ure that you learn how to use water to cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ate , then you &apos;re going to be able to sp@@ read be@@ y@@ ond the N@@ ile ."
"You &apos;re going to be able to power stuff , so ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation makes a difference ."
"I@@ r@@ ri@@ g@@ ation star@@ ts to make you be allow@@ ed to pl@@ ant stuff where you want it , as op@@ posed to where the ri@@ ver@@ s flo@@ od . You start getting this organi@@ c agri@@ culture ; you start pu@@ tting mach@@ in@@ ery on@@ to this stuff . M@@ ach@@ in@@ ery , with a whole bu@@ n@@ ch of water , le@@ ads to very lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale agri@@ culture ."
"You put together mach@@ ines and water , and you get land@@ s@@ cap@@ es that look like this . And then you get s@@ al@@ es that look like this . It &apos;s bru@@ te force . So what you &apos;ve been doing in agri@@ culture is you start out with something that &apos;s a reas@@ on@@ ably natural system . You start tam@@ ing that natural system . You put a lot of force behind that natural system . You put a whole bu@@ n@@ ch of pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des and her@@ bi@@ ci@@ des — ( Laughter ) — behind that natural system , and you end up with systems that look like this ."
"And it &apos;s all bru@@ te force . And that &apos;s the way we &apos;ve been appro@@ ach@@ ing energy . So the l@@ es@@ son in agri@@ culture is that you can actually change the system that &apos;s based on bru@@ te force as you start mer@@ g@@ ing that system and lear@@ ning that system and actually ap@@ pl@@ ying bio@@ logy . And you move from a dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine of engine@@ ering , you move from a dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine of chemi@@ stry , into a dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine of bio@@ logy . And probably one of the most important human be@@ ings on the planet is this guy behind me ."
"This is a guy called Nor@@ man B@@ or@@ l@@ au@@ g . He won the N@@ obe@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze . He &apos;s got the Con@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ onal M@@ ed@@ al of H@@ on@@ or . He des@@ er@@ ves all of this stuff . And he des@@ er@@ ves this stuff because he probably has f@@ ed more people than any other human being ali@@ ve because he resear@@ ched how to put bio@@ logy behind se@@ eds . He did this in M@@ exi@@ co . The reason why Indi@@ a and China no longer have these mas@@ sive fam@@ ines is because Nor@@ man B@@ or@@ l@@ au@@ g t@@ au@@ ght them how to gro@@ w gra@@ ins in a more ef@@ fi@@ cient way and la@@ un@@ ched the Gre@@ en R@@ ev@@ olution . That is something that a lot of people have cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed . But of course , those are@@ "
"@@ people who don &apos;t realize that China and Indi@@ a , instead of having huge amoun@@ ts of star@@ ving people , are ex@@ por@@ ting gra@@ ins ."
"And the i@@ ro@@ ny of this particular system is the place where he did the research , which was M@@ exi@@ co , didn &apos;t ad@@ op@@ t this technology , ig@@ no@@ red this technology , tal@@ ked about why this technology should be thought about , but not really ap@@ pl@@ ied ."
"And M@@ exi@@ co re@@ ma@@ ins one of the largest gra@@ in im@@ por@@ ters on the planet because it doesn &apos;t app@@ ly technology that was disco@@ vered in M@@ exi@@ co . And in fact , ha@@ sn &apos;t re@@ cogni@@ zed this man , to the point where there ar@@ en &apos;t stat@@ u@@ es of this man all over M@@ exi@@ co . There are in China and Indi@@ a . And the In@@ stitu@@ te that this guy ran has now mo@@ ved to Indi@@ a . That is the difference between ad@@ op@@ ting technolog@@ ies and di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing technolog@@ ies ."
"Now , it &apos;s not just that this guy f@@ ed a huge amount of people in the world . It &apos;s that this is the net effe@@ ct in terms of what technology does , if you understand bio@@ logy ."
"What happened in agri@@ culture ? Well , if you take agri@@ culture over a century , agri@@ culture in about 19@@ 00 would have been re@@ cogni@@ z@@ able to somebody plan@@ ting a thous@@ and years ear@@ lie@@ r . Yeah , the pl@@ ow@@ s look different . The mach@@ ines were trac@@ t@@ ors or stuff instead of mu@@ les , but the farm@@ er would have under@@ sto@@ od : this is what the guy &apos;s doing , this is why he &apos;s doing it , this is where he &apos;s going . What really started to change in agri@@ culture is when you started moving from this bru@@ te force engine@@ ering and chemi@@ stry into bio@@ logy , and that &apos;s where you get your produ@@ cti@@ vity incre@@ ases . And as you do that stuff , here &apos;s what happens to@@ "
produ@@ cti@@ vity .
"B@@ a@@ si@@ cally , you go from 2@@ 50 hours to produ@@ ce 100 bus@@ hel@@ s , to 40 , to 15 , to five . A@@ g@@ ri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral lab@@ or produ@@ cti@@ vity incre@@ as@@ ed seven times , 19@@ 50 to 2@@ 000 , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the rest of the econom@@ y incre@@ as@@ ed about 2@@ .@@ 5 times . This is an absolu@@ tely mas@@ sive incre@@ ase in how much is produ@@ ced per person ."
"The effe@@ ct of this , of course , is it &apos;s not just am@@ ber wa@@ ves of gra@@ in , it is m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of stuff ."
And 50 percent of the E@@ U bud@@ get is going to sub@@ si@@ di@@ ze agri@@ culture from m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of stuff that people have over@@ produ@@ ced .
"This would be a good out@@ come for energy . And of course , by now , you &apos;re probably saying to yourself , &quot; &quot; S@@ el@@ f , I thought I came to a talk about energy and here &apos;s this guy talking about bio@@ logy . &quot; &quot; So where &apos;s the lin@@ k between these two things ?"
"One of the i@@ ro@@ nie@@ s of this whole system is we &apos;re di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing what to do about a system that we don &apos;t understand . We don &apos;t even know what oil is . We don &apos;t know where oil comes from . I mean , liter@@ ally , it &apos;s still a source of de@@ b@@ ate what this black ri@@ ver of stuff is and where it comes from . The best as@@ sum@@ ption , and one of the best gu@@ ess@@ es in this stuff , is that this stuff comes out of this stuff , that these things ab@@ sor@@ b su@@ n@@ light , ro@@ t under pres@@ sure for mi@@ llions of years , and you get these black ri@@ ver@@ s ."
"Now , the interesting thing about that the@@ sis — if that the@@ sis turns out to be true — is that oil , and all hy@@ dro@@ car@@ b@@ ons , turned out to be con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated su@@ n@@ light . And if you think of bio@@ energy , bio@@ energy isn &apos;t e@@ th@@ an@@ ol . Bi@@ o@@ energy is taking the su@@ n , con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ating it in a@@ mo@@ e@@ b@@ as , con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ating it in plan@@ ts , and maybe that &apos;s why you get these ra@@ in@@ bow@@ s ."
"And as you &apos;re looking at this system , if hy@@ dro@@ car@@ b@@ ons are con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated su@@ n@@ light , then bio@@ energy works in a different way . And we &apos;ve got to start thinking of oil and other hy@@ dro@@ car@@ b@@ ons as part of these solar pan@@ els ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons why if you f@@ ly over w@@ est T@@ ex@@ as , the typ@@ es of wel@@ ls that you &apos;re beginning to see don &apos;t look un@@ like those pi@@ ctures of K@@ ans@@ as and those ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ated pl@@ ots ."
"This is how you far@@ m oil . And as you think of far@@ ming oil and how oil has ev@@ olved , we started with this bru@@ te force appro@@ ach . And then what did we learn ? Th@@ en we learned we had to go bi@@ g@@ ger . And then what &apos;d we learn ? Th@@ en we have to go even bi@@ g@@ ger . And we are getting really de@@ stru@@ ctive as we &apos;re going out and far@@ ming this bio@@ energy ."
"These are the A@@ th@@ ab@@ as@@ ca t@@ ar s@@ ands , and there &apos;s an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount — first of min@@ ing , the largest tru@@ cks in the world are working here , and then you &apos;ve got to pu@@ ll out this black s@@ lu@@ dge , which is basically oil that doesn &apos;t f@@ low . It &apos;s t@@ ied to the s@@ and . And then you &apos;ve got to use a lot of ste@@ am to se@@ par@@ ate it , which only works at today &apos;s oil pri@@ ces ."
"C@@ o@@ al . Co@@ al turns out to be vi@@ r@@ tually the same stuff . It is probably plan@@ ts , ex@@ cept that these have been bur@@ ned and c@@ rus@@ h@@ ed under pres@@ sure ."
"So you take something like this , you bur@@ n it , you put it under pres@@ sure , and li@@ ke@@ ly as not , you get this . Al@@ though , again , I stre@@ ss : we don &apos;t know ."
"Wh@@ ich is cu@@ ri@@ ous as we de@@ b@@ ate all this stuff . But as you think of co@@ al , this is what bur@@ ned whe@@ at k@@ er@@ ne@@ ls look like . N@@ ot enti@@ re@@ ly un@@ like co@@ al ."
"And of course , co@@ al@@ min@@ es are very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous places because in some of these co@@ al@@ min@@ es , you get gas . When that gas b@@ low@@ s up , people die . So you &apos;re produ@@ cing a bi@@ og@@ as out of co@@ al in some min@@ es , but not in others ."
"A@@ ny place you see a differ@@ enti@@ al , there &apos;re some interesting questions . There &apos;s some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff . But again , co@@ al . Ma@@ ybe the same stuff , maybe the same system , maybe bio@@ energy , and you &apos;re ap@@ pl@@ ying exactly the same technology ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s your bru@@ te force appro@@ ach . O@@ n@@ ce you get through your bru@@ te force appro@@ ach , then you just ri@@ p off whole m@@ oun@@ tain@@ top@@ s . And you end up with the single largest source of car@@ b@@ on e@@ mis@@ sions , which are co@@ al@@ -@@ fi@@ red gas plan@@ ts . That is probably not the best use of bio@@ energy ."
"As you think of what are the alter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves to this system — it &apos;s important to find alter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves because it turns out that the U.@@ S. is d@@ win@@ d@@ ling in its pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um re@@ ser@@ ves , but it is not d@@ win@@ d@@ ling in its co@@ al re@@ ser@@ ves , no@@ r is China . There are huge co@@ al re@@ ser@@ ves that are sitting out there , and we &apos;ve got to start thinking of them as biologi@@ cal energy , because if we keep tre@@ ating them as chemi@@ cal energy , or engine@@ ering energy , we &apos;re going to be in de@@ ep do@@ o@@ -@@ do@@ o ."
"G@@ as is a si@@ mi@@ lar issue . G@@ as is also a biologi@@ cal produ@@ ct . And as you think of gas , well , you &apos;re fami@@ li@@ ar with gas . And here &apos;s a different way of min@@ ing co@@ al ."
"This is called co@@ al bed meth@@ ane . Why is this picture interesting ? Because if co@@ al turns out to be con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated pl@@ ant life , the reason why you may get a differ@@ enti@@ al in gas out@@ put between one m@@ ine and another — the reason why one m@@ ine may b@@ low up and another one may not b@@ low up — may be because there &apos;s stuff e@@ ating that stuff and produ@@ cing gas ."
"This is a wel@@ l-@@ known ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on . ( Laughter ) You e@@ at certain things , you produ@@ ce a lot of gas . It may turn out that biologi@@ cal pro@@ cess@@ es in co@@ al@@ min@@ es have the same process . If that is true , then one of the ways of getting the energy out of co@@ al may not be to ri@@ p whole m@@ oun@@ tain@@ top@@ s off , and it may not be to bur@@ n co@@ al . It may be to have stuff process that co@@ al in a biologi@@ cal fas@@ hi@@ on as you did in agri@@ culture ."
"That is what bio@@ energy is . It is not e@@ th@@ an@@ ol . It is not sub@@ si@@ d@@ ies to a few comp@@ an@@ ies . It is not im@@ por@@ ting cor@@ n into I@@ owa because you &apos;ve built so many of these e@@ th@@ an@@ ol plan@@ ts . It is beginning to understand the tran@@ si@@ tion that oc@@ cur@@ red in agri@@ culture , from bru@@ te force into biologi@@ cal force . And in the meas@@ ure that you can do that , you can cle@@ an some stuff , and you can cle@@ an it pretty quickly ."
"We already have some indi@@ cat@@ ors of produ@@ cti@@ vity on this stuff . OK , if you put ste@@ am into co@@ al fie@@ l@@ ds or pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um fie@@ l@@ ds that have been ru@@ n@@ ning for de@@ ca@@ des , you can get a really sub@@ stan@@ tial incre@@ ase , like an e@@ igh@@ t-@@ f@@ old incre@@ ase , in your out@@ put . This is just the beginning st@@ ages of this stuff ."
"And as you think of bi@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als , this guy — who did part of the sequ@@ en@@ cing of the human gen@@ ome , who just d@@ ou@@ b@@ led the d@@ at@@ ab@@ ases of gen@@ es and prote@@ ins known on ear@@ th by sa@@ il@@ ing around the world — has been thinking about how you structure this . And there &apos;s a ser@@ ies of s@@ mar@@ t people thinking about this . And they &apos;ve been pu@@ tting together comp@@ an@@ ies like Sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic G@@ en@@ omi@@ cs , like , a C@@ am@@ bri@@ a , like C@@ od@@ on , and what those comp@@ an@@ ies are trying to do is to think of , how do you app@@ ly biologi@@ cal prin@@ ci@@ ples to av@@ o@@ id bru@@ te force ?"
Th@@ in@@ k of it in the fol@@ low@@ ing terms . Th@@ in@@ k of it as beginning to program stuff for speci@@ fic pur@@ pos@@ es .
"Th@@ in@@ k of the cell as a har@@ dw@@ are . Th@@ in@@ k of the gen@@ es as a so@@ f@@ tw@@ are . And in the meas@@ ure that you beg@@ in to think of life as c@@ od@@ e that is inter@@ chang@@ e@@ able , that can become energy , that can become food , that can become fi@@ ber , that can become human be@@ ings , that can become a whole ser@@ ies of things , then you &apos;ve got to shi@@ ft your appro@@ ach as to how you &apos;re going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way ."
What are the first prin@@ ci@@ ples of this stuff and where are we he@@ ading ? This is one of the g@@ ent@@ le gi@@ an@@ ts on the planet . He &apos;s one of the nic@@ est human be@@ ings you &apos;ve ever met . H@@ is name is H@@ am@@ il@@ ton S@@ mi@@ th . He won the N@@ obe@@ l for fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing out how to cut gen@@ es — something called re@@ stri@@ ction en@@ zy@@ mes .
"He was at H@@ op@@ k@@ ins when he did this , and he &apos;s such a mo@@ d@@ est guy that the day he won , his mother called him and said , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t realize there was another H@@ am S@@ mi@@ th at H@@ op@@ k@@ ins . Do you know he just won the N@@ obe@@ l ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , that was M@@ om , but any@@ way , this guy is just a clas@@ s act . You find him at the b@@ en@@ ch every single day , working on a pi@@ pe@@ t@@ te and building stuff . And one of the things this guy just built are these things ."
"What is this ? This is the first tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant of na@@ ked DNA , where you take an entire DNA oper@@ ating system out of one cell , in@@ ser@@ t it into a different cell , and have that cell bo@@ ot up as a se@@ par@@ ate species . That &apos;s one mon@@ th old . You will see stuff in the next mon@@ th that will be just as important as this stuff ."
"And as you think about this stuff and what the im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations of this are , we &apos;re going to start not just con@@ ver@@ ting e@@ th@@ an@@ ol from cor@@ n with very high sub@@ si@@ d@@ ies . We &apos;re going to start thinking about bio@@ logy en@@ ter@@ ing energy . It is very ex@@ pen@@ sive to process this stuff , both in economic terms and in energy terms ."
"This is what ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ lat@@ es in the t@@ ar s@@ ands of Al@@ ber@@ ta . These are sul@@ fu@@ r blo@@ cks . Because as you se@@ par@@ ate that pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um from the s@@ and , and use an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of energy inside that v@@ apo@@ r — ste@@ am to se@@ par@@ ate this stuff — you also have to se@@ par@@ ate out the sul@@ fu@@ r . The difference between light c@@ ru@@ de and he@@ av@@ y c@@ ru@@ de — well , it &apos;s about 14 bu@@ cks a bar@@ re@@ l . That &apos;s why you &apos;re building these py@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds of sul@@ fu@@ r blo@@ cks . And by the way , the scale on these things is pretty large ."
"Now , if you can take part of the energy cont@@ ent out of doing this , you redu@@ ce the system , and you really do start ap@@ pl@@ ying biologi@@ cal prin@@ ci@@ ples to energy . This has to be a bri@@ dge to the point where you can get to wind , to the point where you can get to solar , to the point where you can get to nuclear — and hop@@ e@@ fully you won &apos;t build the next nuclear pl@@ ant on a beautiful se@@ as@@ hor@@ e next to an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake f@@ au@@ l@@ t . ( Laughter ) J@@ ust a thought ."
"But in the me@@ an@@ time , for the next dec@@ ade at least , the name of the g@@ ame is hy@@ dro@@ car@@ b@@ ons . And be that oil , be that gas , be that co@@ al , this is what we &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with . And before I make this talk too long , here &apos;s what &apos;s happening in the cur@@ r@@ ent energy system ."
"@@ 8@@ 6 percent of the energy we con@@ su@@ me are hy@@ dro@@ car@@ b@@ ons . That means 8@@ 6 percent of the stuff we &apos;re con@@ sum@@ ing are probably pro@@ cess@@ ed plan@@ ts and a@@ mo@@ e@@ b@@ as and the rest of the stuff . And there &apos;s a ro@@ le in here for con@@ ser@@ vation . There &apos;s a ro@@ le in here for alter@@ n@@ ative stuff , but we &apos;ve also got to get that other por@@ tion right ."
"H@@ ow we deal with that other por@@ tion is our bri@@ dge to the future . And as we think of this bri@@ dge to the future , one of the things you should pon@@ der is : we are lea@@ ving about two@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ ds of the oil today inside those wel@@ ls . So we &apos;re sp@@ ending an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of money and lea@@ ving most of the energy down there . Wh@@ ich , of course , requi@@ res more energy to go out and get energy . The r@@ ati@@ os become i@@ di@@ oti@@ c by the time you get to e@@ th@@ an@@ ol . It may even be a one@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ one r@@ ati@@ o on the energy in@@ put and the energy out@@ put . That is a stu@@ pi@@ d way of@@ "
man@@ ag@@ ing this system .
"L@@ ast point , last gra@@ ph . One of the things that we &apos;ve got to do is to st@@ abi@@ li@@ ze oil pri@@ ces . This is what oil pri@@ ces look like , OK ?"
"This is a very bad system because what happens is your h@@ ur@@ d@@ le r@@ ate gets set very low . Pe@@ ople come up with really s@@ mar@@ t ideas for solar pan@@ els , or for wind , or for something else , and then gu@@ ess what ?"
"The oil pri@@ ce goes through the flo@@ or . That company goes out of business , and then you can bring the oil pri@@ ce back up ."
"So if I had one clo@@ sing and mo@@ d@@ est su@@ gg@@ esti@@ on , let &apos;s set a st@@ able oil pri@@ ce in Europ@@ e and the United States . How do you do that ? Well , let &apos;s put a ta@@ x on oil that is a n@@ on-@@ re@@ ven@@ ue ta@@ x , and it basically says for the next 20 years , the pri@@ ce of oil will be — whatever you want , 3@@ 5 bu@@ cks , 40 bu@@ cks . If the O@@ P@@ E@@ C pri@@ ce fal@@ ls be@@ low that , we ta@@ x it . If the O@@ P@@ E@@ C pri@@ ce goes ab@@ o@@ ve that , the ta@@ x goes away ."
"What does that do for ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s ? What does it do for comp@@ an@@ ies ? It tel@@ ls people , if you can produ@@ ce energy for less than 3@@ 5 bu@@ cks a bar@@ re@@ l , or less than 40 bu@@ cks a bar@@ re@@ l , or less than 50 bu@@ cks a bar@@ re@@ l — let &apos;s de@@ b@@ ate it — you will have a business . But let &apos;s not put people through this cy@@ cle where it doesn &apos;t pay to research because your company will go out of business as O@@ P@@ E@@ C dri@@ ves alter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves and ke@@ e@@ ps bio@@ energy from happening . Thank you ."
"The first time I en@@ ter@@ ed M@@ an@@ shi@@ y@@ at N@@ as@@ er , it felt like a ma@@ ze ."
I was looking for the St@@ . S@@ im@@ on M@@ on@@ ast@@ ery on the top of the Mu@@ q@@ at@@ tam M@@ oun@@ tain .
A@@ d@@ d to it the d@@ in created by the c@@ rus@@ h@@ ers in those war@@ e@@ h@@ ous@@ es along the way .
I am really gr@@ ate@@ ful to Mar@@ i@@ o . He was the key of the project .
"He man@@ aged to get me a me@@ e@@ ting with F@@ a@@ ther S@@ am@@ a@@ an , and sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly , he lo@@ ved the idea ."
And he was ma@@ in@@ ly con@@ cer@@ ned by what I was going to write .
"H@@ ere some blue , there some y@@ el@@ low , there some or@@ ange ."
They just work out of it .
"A@@ c@@ tually , they don ’ t live in the gar@@ b@@ age . They live from the gar@@ b@@ age ."
So I started d@@ ou@@ b@@ ting myself and wonder@@ ing what was the real pur@@ pos@@ e of this whole project ?
It was not about beauti@@ f@@ ying a place by br@@ ing@@ ing art to it .
But the kin@@ d@@ ness of all those people made us for@@ get everything .
The building number 3 was the house of U@@ n@@ cle B@@ ak@@ he@@ et and A@@ un@@ ty F@@ are@@ ed@@ a .
"In E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an , they have this ex@@ pres@@ sion that says , &quot; &quot; A@@ h@@ s@@ en N@@ as , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; the best people . &quot; &quot; They were the best people ."
I was im@@ pres@@ sed and amaz@@ ed by the kids of M@@ an@@ shi@@ y@@ at N@@ as@@ er .
"There &apos;s a lot of exci@@ ting things happening in the design world and at ID@@ E@@ O this past year , and I &apos;m ple@@ as@@ ed to get a ch@@ ance to share some of those with you ."
I didn &apos;t at@@ ten@@ d the first TED back in 19@@ 8@@ 4 but I &apos;ve been to a lot of them since that time .
"I thought it &#91; would &#93; kind of be interesting to think back to that time when Ri@@ ch@@ ard got the whole thing started . Thank you very much , Ri@@ ch@@ ard ; it &apos;s been a big , en@@ jo@@ y@@ able part of my life , coming here ."
"And so thinking back , I was thinking those of us in S@@ i@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ ley were really fo@@ c@@ used on produ@@ cts or obje@@ cts — cer@@ tain@@ ly technologi@@ cal obje@@ cts ."
"And so it was great fun in those days , and some of those of you who are in the audience were my cl@@ ien@@ ts ."
"We &apos;d come in with some pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pe under@@ ne@@ ath a black c@@ lot@@ h and we &apos;d put it on the con@@ fer@@ ence table , and we &apos;d pu@@ ll off the black c@@ lot@@ h and everybody would &quot; &quot; o@@ oh &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ah . &quot; &quot; That was a really good time ."
"And so we &apos;ll contin@@ ue to fo@@ cus on produ@@ cts , as we always have ."
"And if you were here last year , I probably w@@ re@@ st@@ led you to the flo@@ or and tr@@ ied to show you my new E@@ ye@@ M@@ od@@ u@@ le 2 , which was a cam@@ era that p@@ lu@@ gg@@ ed into the H@@ and@@ sp@@ ring ."
"And I took a lot of pi@@ ctures last year ; very few people knew what I was up to , but I took a lot of pi@@ ctures ."
"This year — maybe you could show the sli@@ des — this year we &apos;re car@@ ry@@ ing this T@@ re@@ o , which we had a lot to do with and hel@@ ped H@@ and@@ sp@@ ring design it ."
"A@@ l@@ so , though we desig@@ ned it a few years ago — it &apos;s just become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous in the last year or so — this H@@ ear@@ t@@ stre@@ am de@@ fi@@ bri@@ l@@ lat@@ or which is sa@@ ving lives ."
Ma@@ ybe you &apos;ve seen them in the air@@ por@@ ts ? They se@@ em to be every@@ where now .
L@@ ots of lives are being sa@@ ved by those .
"And , we &apos;re just about to an@@ n@@ oun@@ ce the Z@@ ini@@ o Re@@ a@@ der produ@@ ct that I believe will make mag@@ az@@ ines even more en@@ jo@@ y@@ able to read ."
"So , we really will contin@@ ue to fo@@ cus on produ@@ cts ."
"But something &apos;s happened in the last 18 years since Ri@@ ch@@ ard started TED , and that &apos;s that people like us — I know people in other places have ca@@ u@@ ght on@@ to this for a long time , but for us , we &apos;ve really just started ... we &apos;ve kind of clim@@ bed M@@ as@@ low &apos;s h@@ ier@@ ar@@ chy a little bit — and so we &apos;re now fo@@ c@@ used more and more on hum@@ an@@ -@@ cen@@ ter@@ ed design , hum@@ an@@ -@@ cen@@ ter@@ ed@@ ness in an appro@@ ach to design ."
That really inv@@ ol@@ ves desig@@ ning behavi@@ ors and per@@ son@@ ality into produ@@ cts .
"And I think you &apos;re star@@ ting to see that , and it &apos;s making our job even more en@@ jo@@ y@@ able ."
"In@@ ter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly enough , we used to pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly build 3@@ -@@ D mode@@ ls — you know , you &apos;ve seen some today — and 3@@ -@@ D ren@@ der@@ ings ."
Th@@ en we &apos;d go and we &apos;d show those as communi@@ c@@ ating our ideas .
"But fir@@ ms like ours are having to move to a point where we get those obje@@ cts that we &apos;re desig@@ ning and get them in moti@@ on , show@@ ing how they &apos;ll be used ."
And so in order to do that we &apos;ve been form@@ ing inter@@ na@@ l vi@@ de@@ o@@ -@@ produ@@ ction grou@@ ps in order to make these kind of experience pro@@ t@@ oty@@ p@@ es that show just what we mean about the man@@ -@@ mach@@ ine relation@@ ship .
And it &apos;s a much better way to see .
"It &apos;s kind of like archite@@ cts who show people in their h@@ ous@@ es , as op@@ posed to them being em@@ p@@ ty ."
"So I thought that I would show you a few vi@@ de@@ os to show off this new , bro@@ a@@ der defini@@ tion of design in produ@@ cts and ser@@ vi@@ ces and environ@@ ments ."
"I have a few of them — they &apos;re no more than a minu@@ te or a minu@@ te@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half a@@ piece — but I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year , and how it respon@@ ds in video ."
"So , P@@ ra@@ da New York : we were asked by R@@ em Ko@@ ol@@ ha@@ as and O@@ M@@ A to help us con@@ cei@@ ve the technology that &apos;s in their re@@ ta@@ il stor@@ e in New York ."
He wanted a new kind of stor@@ e — a new one — a stor@@ e that had a cul@@ tu@@ ral ro@@ le as well as a re@@ ta@@ il one .
And that me@@ ant actually desig@@ ning cu@@ st@@ om technology as op@@ posed to just bu@@ ying things off the sh@@ el@@ f and pu@@ tting them to use .
"So , there &apos;re lots of things . E@@ very@@ thing has R@@ F t@@ ag@@ s : there &apos;s R@@ F t@@ ag@@ s on the us@@ er , on the car@@ ds , there &apos;s the st@@ af@@ f de@@ vi@@ ces that are all around the stor@@ e ."
"You pi@@ ck them up , and once you see something that you &apos;re interested in , the st@@ af@@ f person can s@@ can them in and then they can be sh@@ own on any scre@@ en throu@@ gh@@ out the stor@@ e ."
"You can look at color , and si@@ z@@ es , and how it ap@@ pe@@ ared on the ru@@ n@@ way , or whatever ."
"And so then the obje@@ ct — the mer@@ ch@@ an@@ di@@ se that you &apos;re interested in — can be sc@@ an@@ ned . It &apos;s taken into the dre@@ s@@ sing room , and in the dre@@ s@@ sing room there are sc@@ an@@ n@@ ers so that we know exactly what clo@@ thing you have in the dre@@ s@@ sing room ."
"We can put that up on a tou@@ ch scre@@ en and you can play with that , and get more information about the clo@@ thing that you &apos;re interested in as you &apos;re trying it on ."
"It &apos;s been used a lot of places , but I parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly like the use here of li@@ qu@@ id c@@ r@@ yst@@ al disp@@ la@@ ys in the chang@@ ing room ."
"The last time I went to see this stor@@ e , there was a huge bu@@ z@@ z about people standing outside and wonder@@ ing , &quot; A@@ m I going to actually get to see the people chang@@ ing clo@@ the@@ s here ? &quot;"
"But if you p@@ us@@ h the bu@@ t@@ ton , of course , the whole w@@ all goes dar@@ k ."
"So you can try to get appro@@ v@@ al , or not , for whatever you &apos;re we@@ aring ."
"And then one of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te fe@@ at@@ ures of the technology is the mag@@ ic mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , where you put on the clo@@ the@@ s ."
"There &apos;s a big disp@@ l@@ ay in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and you can turn around — but there &apos;s a three second de@@ l@@ ay ."
"So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around , as you look ."
"( Applause ) A@@ b@@ out a year and a half ago we were asked to design an in@@ stal@@ l@@ ation in the mus@@ e@@ um — this is a new w@@ ing of the S@@ cien@@ ce M@@ us@@ e@@ um in Lon@@ don , and it &apos;s pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly about di@@ gi@@ tal and bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal issu@@ es ."
"And a group at I@@ t@@ ch , which is now part of ID@@ E@@ O , desig@@ ned this inter@@ ac@@ tive w@@ all that &apos;s about four stories t@@ all ."
I don &apos;t know if any@@ body &apos;s seen this — it &apos;s pretty spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar in the room .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , it &apos;s based on the Lon@@ don sub@@ way system ."
"And so you can see that the go@@ al is to bring some of the fe@@ ed@@ back that the people who had gone to the mus@@ e@@ um were gi@@ ving , and get it up on the w@@ all so everybody could see . J@@ ust for everybody to see ."
"So you enter your information . Th@@ en , like the Lon@@ don tu@@ be system , the little tra@@ ins go around with what you &apos;re thinking about ."

"And also , it &apos;s not sh@@ own in the video , but these are very beautiful ."
"They go to the top of the w@@ all and when they re@@ ach all the way to the top , after they &apos;ve b@@ oun@@ ced around , they disp@@ er@@ se into bi@@ ts and go off into the atmo@@ sp@@ here ."
The next video is not done by us .
This is C@@ B@@ S S@@ un@@ day M@@ or@@ ning that a@@ i@@ red about two weeks ago .
"S@@ c@@ ot@@ t A@@ dam@@ s ran into us and asked us if we wouldn &apos;t help to design the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate cu@@ bi@@ cle for D@@ il@@ ber@@ t , which soun@@ ded like a fun thing and so we couldn &apos;t pas@@ s it up ."
He &apos;s always been interested in technology in the future .
( V@@ ide@@ o : S@@ c@@ ot@@ t A@@ dam@@ s : I realized that at some point I might be the world &apos;s exper@@ t on what &apos;s wrong with cu@@ bi@@ cles .
"So we thought , well , wouldn &apos;t it be fun to get together with some of the s@@ mar@@ test design guys in the world and try to figure out if we could make the cu@@ bi@@ cle better ?"
"N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : Th@@ ough they work in a wi@@ de@@ -@@ open offi@@ ce space spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ u@@ lar@@ ly set under S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co &apos;s O@@ ak@@ land B@@ ay Bri@@ dge , the team built their own little cu@@ bi@@ cles to fully experience the problems ."
W@@ om@@ an : A one@@ -@@ way mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r . I can look out ; you can look at yourself .
N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : They took pi@@ ctures .
"W@@ om@@ an : You feel so tra@@ pped , when someone kind of le@@ ans over and you &apos;re sort of he@@ ld cap@@ tive there for a minu@@ te ."
"S@@ A : So far it &apos;s cha@@ os , but a lot of people are doing stuff , so that &apos;s good ."
We &apos;ll see what happens .
N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : The first group buil@@ ds a cu@@ bi@@ cle in which the wal@@ ls are scre@@ ens for the computer and for family ph@@ ot@@ os .
"In the second group &apos;s scen@@ ari@@ o , the wal@@ ls are ali@@ ve and actually give D@@ il@@ ber@@ t a group hu@@ g ."
"( Laughter ) Be@@ hind the hu@@ mo@@ r is the idea of making the cu@@ bi@@ cle more human . ) Davi@@ d K@@ el@@ ley : So here &apos;s the fin@@ al thing , comple@@ te with or@@ ange li@@ gh@@ ting that fol@@ low@@ s the su@@ n across — that fol@@ low@@ s the trac@@ ks of the su@@ n — across the sk@@ y ."
So you feel that in your cu@@ bi@@ cle .
"And my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te fe@@ ature , which is a f@@ low@@ er in a v@@ ase that wil@@ ts when you leave in disa@@ p@@ poin@@ t@@ ment , and then when you come back , it comes up to gre@@ et you , happy to see you ."
"( SA : The stor@@ age is built right into the w@@ all . ) D@@ K : You know , it has hom@@ ey tou@@ ch@@ es like a buil@@ t-@@ in fish t@@ ank in the wal@@ ls , or something to be ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sive with to rele@@ ase ten@@ sion ."

"( SA : Li@@ fe would be s@@ we@@ et in a cu@@ bi@@ cle like this . ) D@@ K : This next project , we were asked to design a pa@@ vi@@ li@@ on to ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate the re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling of the water on the M@@ il@@ len@@ ni@@ um D@@ ome in Lon@@ don ."
"The dom@@ e has an incredible amount of water that wa@@ sh@@ es off of it , as well as wa@@ ste@@ water ."
So this building actually ce@@ le@@ br@@ ates the water as it comes out of the re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling pl@@ ant and goes into the re@@ ed bed so that it can be fil@@ ter@@ ed for the fin@@ al time .
The pa@@ vi@@ li@@ on &apos;s design go@@ al was to be kind of qu@@ ie@@ t and pe@@ ace@@ ful .
"In con@@ tra@@ st to if you went inside the dom@@ e , where it &apos;s kind of wi@@ ld and c@@ razy and everybody &apos;s lear@@ ning all kinds of things , or fo@@ ol@@ ing around , or whatever they &apos;re doing ."
But it was inten@@ ded to be quite qu@@ ie@@ t .
"And then you would wan@@ der around and ga@@ ther information , in a stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward fas@@ hi@@ on , about the re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling process and what &apos;s being done , and how they &apos;re going to re@@ use the water once it comes through the pl@@ ant ."
"And then , if you saw , the pan@@ els actually ro@@ t@@ ate . So you can get the information on the front side , but as they ro@@ t@@ ate , you can see the ac@@ tu@@ al re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling pl@@ ant behind , with all the mach@@ ines as they actually process the water ."
You can see : there &apos;s the pl@@ ant .
"These are all very low@@ -@@ bud@@ get vi@@ de@@ os , like qui@@ ck pro@@ t@@ oty@@ p@@ es ."
"And we &apos;re an@@ n@@ oun@@ cing a new produ@@ ct here ton@@ ight , which is the first time this has ever been sh@@ own in public ."
"It &apos;s called S@@ py@@ fish , and it &apos;s a company called H@@ 2@@ E@@ y@@ e , started by Ni@@ ge@@ l J@@ ag@@ ger in Lon@@ don ."
"And it &apos;s a company that &apos;s trying to bring the experience — many people have bo@@ ats , or en@@ jo@@ y being on bo@@ ats , but a very small per@@ cent@@ age of people actually have the cap@@ ability or the inter@@ est in going under the water and actually seeing what &apos;s there , and en@@ jo@@ ying what s@@ cu@@ ba di@@ ver@@ s do ."
"This produ@@ ct , it has two cam@@ er@@ as ."
You th@@ row it over the side of your boat and you basically s@@ cu@@ ba di@@ ve without getting w@@ et .
"For us — there &apos;s the obje@@ ct — for us , it was two proje@@ cts . One , to design the inter@@ face so that the inter@@ face doesn &apos;t get in your way ."
You could have that kind of im@@ mer@@ sive experience of being under@@ water — of feeling like you &apos;re under@@ water — seeing what &apos;s going on .
And the other one was to design the obje@@ ct and make sure that it was a con@@ sum@@ er produ@@ ct and not a research to@@ ol .
"And so we spent a lot of time — this has been going on for about seven or eight years , this project — and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; just ready to start building them ."
( N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : The S@@ py@@ fish is a re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary su@@ ba@@ qu@@ atic video cam@@ era .
"It can di@@ ve to 500 fe@@ et , to where su@@ n@@ light does not pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ate , and is e@@ qui@@ pped with powerful li@@ ghts ."

"A@@ p@@ pro@@ TE@@ C is a company started by D@@ r. Mar@@ t@@ in F@@ i@@ sh@@ er , who &apos;s a good friend of m@@ ine . He &apos;s a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . from St@@ an@@ for@@ d ."
"He found hi@@ m@@ self in Ken@@ ya on a F@@ ul@@ b@@ right and he had a very interesting in@@ si@@ ght , which is that he said , &quot; &quot; There must be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s in Ken@@ ya ; there must be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s every@@ where . &quot; &quot; And he noti@@ ced that for we@@ dd@@ ings and fun@@ er@@ als there they could find enough money to put something together ."
"So he decided to start man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing produ@@ cts in Ken@@ ya with Ken@@ y@@ an man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers — desig@@ ned by people like us , but taken there ."
"And to this d@@ ate — he &apos;s been gone for only a few years — he &apos;s started 19@@ ,000 comp@@ an@@ ies ."
"He &apos;s made 3@@ 0,000 new j@@ ob@@ s ."
And just the s@@ al@@ es of the produ@@ cts — this is a n@@ on-@@ prof@@ it — the s@@ al@@ es of these produ@@ cts is now .@@ 6 % of the G@@ D@@ P of Ken@@ ya .
This is one guy doing this . This is a pretty spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar thing .
"So we &apos;re in the process of hel@@ ping them design de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ well , low@@ -@@ cost man@@ u@@ al pu@@ m@@ ps in order for these people who have a qu@@ ar@@ ter ac@@ re of land to be able to gro@@ w cro@@ ps in the of@@ f-@@ se@@ as@@ on ."
What they do now is : they can gro@@ w cro@@ ps in the ra@@ iny se@@ as@@ on but they can &apos;t gro@@ w them in the of@@ f-@@ se@@ as@@ on .
"And so by doing that , the woman that you saw in the first thing — she &apos;s a school teach@@ er — always wanted to sen@@ d her kids to colle@@ ge and she &apos;s going to be able to do it because of these things ."
"So with se@@ ed@@ -@@ squ@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ ers , and pu@@ m@@ ps , and ha@@ y@@ -@@ bal@@ ers and very stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward things that we &apos;re desig@@ ning — my students are doing this as clas@@ s proje@@ cts and ID@@ E@@ O has d@@ on@@ ated their time to do this kind of work — it &apos;s really amazing to see his suc@@ cess , Mar@@ t@@ in &apos;s ."
"We also were thinking about the experience of Ri@@ ch@@ ard , and so — ( Laughter ) — we desig@@ ned this h@@ at , because I knew I &apos;d be the last one in the day and I needed to deal with him . So I just have one more thing to say . ( Laughter )"
C@@ an you read it ? ( Laughter )
"Well , it &apos;s always kind of fun@@ ny when he comes up and ho@@ ver@@ s ."
"You know , you don &apos;t want to be ru@@ de to him and you don &apos;t want to feel gu@@ il@@ ty , and so I thought this would do it , where I just si@@ t here ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we saw a lot of interesting things being desig@@ ned today in this s@@ es@@ sion , and from all the different pre@@ sen@@ ters ."
"And in my own prac@@ ti@@ ce , from produ@@ ct to Ap@@ pro@@ TE@@ C , it &apos;s really exci@@ ting that we &apos;re taking a more hum@@ an@@ -@@ cen@@ ter@@ ed appro@@ ach to design , that we &apos;re inclu@@ ding behavi@@ ors and per@@ son@@ ali@@ ties in the things we do , and I think this is great ."
"D@@ e@@ sig@@ n@@ ers are more tru@@ st@@ ed and more inte@@ gr@@ ated into the business strate@@ gy of comp@@ an@@ ies , and I have to say , for one , I feel very lu@@ ck@@ y at the pro@@ gre@@ ss that design has made since the first TED . Th@@ an@@ ks a lot ."
N@@ am@@ ast@@ e . Go@@ od morning .
I &apos;m very happy to be here in Indi@@ a .
"And I &apos;ve been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly 11 years with V@@ -@@ D@@ ay and &quot; &quot; The V@@ ag@@ ina M@@ on@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ es , &quot; &quot; tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing the world , essen@@ ti@@ ally me@@ e@@ ting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women ."
"What I want to talk about today is this particular cell , or grou@@ ping of cells , that is in each and every one of us ."
And I want to call it the girl cell .
And it &apos;s in men as well as in women .
I want you to imagine that this particular grou@@ ping of cells is cent@@ ral to the ev@@ olution of our species and the contin@@ u@@ ation of the human rac@@ e .
"And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people inv@@ est@@ ed in ow@@ ning and contro@@ l@@ ling the world under@@ sto@@ od that the sup@@ pres@@ sion of this particular cell , the op@@ pres@@ sion of these cells , the re@@ inter@@ pret@@ ation of these cells , the under@@ min@@ ing of these cells , getting us to believe in the we@@ ak@@ ness of these cells and the c@@ rus@@ h@@ ing , er@@ ad@@ i@@ c@@ ating , de@@ stro@@ ying , redu@@ cing these cells , basically began the process of kil@@ ling off the girl cell , which was , by the way , pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ chy ."
I want you to imagine that the girl is a chi@@ p in the huge m@@ ac@@ ro@@ co@@ sm of colle@@ ctive con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness .
"And it is essen@@ tial to bal@@ ance , to wi@@ s@@ dom and to actually the future of all of us ."
"And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell is comp@@ as@@ sion , and it &apos;s em@@ pa@@ th@@ y , and it &apos;s pas@@ sion itself , and it &apos;s v@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability , and it &apos;s open@@ ness , and it &apos;s inten@@ sity , and it &apos;s as@@ so@@ ci@@ ation , and it &apos;s relation@@ ship , and it is in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive ."
"And then let &apos;s think how comp@@ as@@ sion inform@@ s wi@@ s@@ dom , and that v@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability is our gre@@ at@@ est str@@ eng@@ th , and that emoti@@ ons have in@@ her@@ ent logi@@ c , which le@@ ad to radi@@ cal , appro@@ pri@@ ate , sa@@ ving action ."
"And then let &apos;s remember that we &apos;ve been t@@ au@@ ght the ex@@ act op@@ posi@@ te by the pow@@ ers that be , that comp@@ as@@ sion cl@@ ou@@ ds your thinking , that it gets in the way , that v@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability is we@@ ak@@ ness , that emoti@@ ons are not to be tru@@ st@@ ed , and you &apos;re not sup@@ posed to take things per@@ son@@ ally , which is one of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ tes ."
I think the whole world has essen@@ ti@@ ally been brought up not to be a girl .
How do we bring up bo@@ ys ? What does it mean to be a bo@@ y ?
To be a bo@@ y really means not to be a girl .
To be a man means not to be a girl .
To be a woman means not to be a girl .
To be stron@@ g means not to be a girl .
To be a lea@@ der means not to be a girl .
I actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we &apos;ve had to tra@@ in everyone not to be that .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;d also like to say that the i@@ ro@@ ny of course , is that den@@ ying girl , sup@@ pres@@ sing girl , sup@@ pres@@ sing emoti@@ on , ref@@ using feeling has le@@ ad th@@ us here ."
"W@@ here we have now come to live in a world where the most extre@@ me form@@ s of violence , the most hor@@ ri@@ fic po@@ ver@@ ty , gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de , mas@@ s ra@@ p@@ es , the de@@ stru@@ ction of the Earth , is completely out of control ."
"And because we have sup@@ pres@@ sed our girl cells and sup@@ pres@@ sed our gir@@ l-@@ ship , we do not feel what is going on ."
"So , we are not being char@@ g@@ ed with the a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate respon@@ se to what is happening ."
I want to talk a little bit about the De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic Re@@ public of Con@@ go .
"For me , it was the tur@@ ning point of my life ."
I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years .
"I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world , a lot of violence ."
I essen@@ ti@@ ally li@@ ved in the ra@@ pe min@@ es of the world for the last 12 years .
But the De@@ moc@@ r@@ atic Re@@ public of Con@@ go really was the tur@@ ning point in my s@@ ou@@ l .
"I went and I spent time in a place called Bu@@ ka@@ v@@ u in a ho@@ spit@@ al called the P@@ an@@ z@@ i H@@ o@@ spit@@ al , with a do@@ ctor who was as close to a sa@@ int as any person I &apos;ve ever met ."
H@@ is name is D@@ r. D@@ en@@ is Mu@@ kwe@@ ge .
"In the Con@@ go , for those of you who don &apos;t know , there has been a war ra@@ g@@ ing for the last 12 years , a war that has kil@@ led ne@@ ar@@ ly six million people ."
"It is est@@ im@@ ated that some@@ where between 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 and 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 women have been ra@@ ped there ."
When I spent my first weeks at P@@ an@@ z@@ i ho@@ spit@@ al I s@@ at with women who s@@ at and lin@@ ed up every day to tell me their stories .
"Th@@ e@@ ir stories were so hor@@ ri@@ fic , and so min@@ d-@@ b@@ low@@ ing and so on the other side of human ex@@ ist@@ ence , that to be perfe@@ ct@@ ly hon@@ est with you , I was sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed ."
"And I will tell you that what happened is through that sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing , list@@ ening to the stories of e@@ igh@@ t-@@ year@@ -@@ old girls who had their in@@ si@@ des evi@@ sc@@ er@@ ated , who had g@@ un@@ s and ba@@ y@@ one@@ ts and things sho@@ ved inside them so they had ho@@ les , liter@@ ally , inside them where their pe@@ e and po@@ o@@ p came out of them ."
"L@@ ist@@ ening to the story of 8@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old women who were t@@ ied to cha@@ ins and cir@@ c@@ led , and where grou@@ ps of men would come and ra@@ pe them per@@ i@@ od@@ i@@ cally , all in the name of economic ex@@ plo@@ it@@ ation to ste@@ al the min@@ er@@ als so the W@@ est can have it and prof@@ it from them ."
My mind was so sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed .
But what happened for me is that that sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing actually em@@ b@@ ol@@ den@@ ed me in a way I have never been em@@ b@@ ol@@ den@@ ed .
"That sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing , that open@@ ing of my girl cell , that kind of mas@@ sive bre@@ ak@@ through of my heart allow@@ ed me to become more cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous , and bra@@ ver , and actually more cle@@ ver than I had been in the past in my life ."
I want to say that I think the pow@@ ers that be know that em@@ pi@@ re@@ -@@ building is actually — that feel@@ ings get in the way of em@@ pi@@ re@@ -@@ building .
"F@@ e@@ el@@ ings get in the way of the mas@@ s ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion of the Earth , and ex@@ ca@@ v@@ ating the Earth , and de@@ stro@@ ying things ."
"I remember , for example , when my father , who was very , very viol@@ ent , used to be@@ at me ."
"And he would actually say , while he was be@@ ating me , &quot; D@@ on &apos;t you c@@ ry . D@@ on &apos;t you d@@ are c@@ ry . &quot;"
Because my c@@ ry@@ ing some@@ how ex@@ posed his bru@@ t@@ ality to him .
And even in the moment he didn &apos;t want to be re@@ min@@ ded of what he was doing .
I know that we have system@@ ati@@ cally an@@ ni@@ h@@ il@@ ated the girl cell .
And I want to say we &apos;ve an@@ ni@@ h@@ il@@ ated it in men as well as in women .
And I think in some ways we &apos;ve been much har@@ sh@@ er to men in the an@@ ni@@ h@@ il@@ ation of their girl cell .
"( Applause ) I see how bo@@ ys have been brought up , and I see this across the planet : to be t@@ ough , to be har@@ den@@ ed , to di@@ stance themselves from their ten@@ der@@ ness , to not c@@ ry ."
"I actually realized once in K@@ os@@ o@@ v@@ o , when I wat@@ ched a man bre@@ ak down , that bu@@ l@@ le@@ ts are actually har@@ den@@ ed te@@ ars , that when we don &apos;t al@@ low men to have their girl self and have their v@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability , and have their comp@@ as@@ sion , and have their hear@@ ts , that they become har@@ den@@ ed and h@@ ur@@ t@@ ful and viol@@ ent ."
"And I think we have t@@ au@@ ght men to be secu@@ re when they are in@@ secu@@ re , to pre@@ ten@@ d they know things when they don &apos;t know things , or why would we be where we are ?"
To pre@@ ten@@ d they &apos;re not a m@@ ess when they are a m@@ ess .
And I will tell you a very fun@@ ny story .
"O@@ n my way here on the air@@ pl@@ ane , I was wal@@ king up and down the a@@ is@@ le of the pl@@ ane ."
"And all these men , liter@@ ally at least 10 men , were in their little se@@ ats wat@@ ching chi@@ ck f@@ lic@@ ks ."
"And they were all alone , and I thought , &quot; &quot; This is the se@@ cre@@ t life of men . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve tra@@ ve@@ led , as I said , to many , many countries , and I &apos;ve seen , if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obvi@@ ously it &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ fic to think what we do to girls in the world ."
"And we heard from S@@ uni@@ th@@ a y@@ est@@ er@@ day , and K@@ avi@@ ta about what we do to girls ."
"But I just want to say that I &apos;ve met girls with k@@ ni@@ fe w@@ oun@@ ds and ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te bur@@ ns , who are liter@@ ally being tre@@ ated like ash@@ tra@@ ys ."
I &apos;ve seen girls be tre@@ ated like gar@@ b@@ age cans .
I &apos;ve seen girls who were be@@ at@@ en by their mo@@ thers and bro@@ thers and fa@@ thers and un@@ cles .
I &apos;ve seen girls star@@ ving themselves to death in America in institu@@ tions to look like some ide@@ aliz@@ ed ver@@ sion of themselves .
"I &apos;ve seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them il@@ liter@@ ate , or we make them feel bad about being too s@@ mar@@ t ."
"We sil@@ ence them . We make them feel gu@@ il@@ ty for being s@@ mar@@ t . We get them to be@@ have , to t@@ one it down , not to be too inten@@ se ."
"We se@@ ll them , we ki@@ ll them as em@@ b@@ ry@@ os , we en@@ s@@ la@@ ve them , we ra@@ pe them ."
We are so ac@@ cu@@ st@@ om@@ ed to rob@@ b@@ ing girls of the sub@@ je@@ ct of being the sub@@ je@@ cts of their lives that we have now actually obje@@ cti@@ f@@ ied them and turned them into com@@ mo@@ di@@ ties .
The sel@@ ling of girls is ra@@ m@@ p@@ ant across the planet .
And in many places they are wor@@ th less than go@@ ats and c@@ ow@@ s .
"But I also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of 10 to 2@@ 4 , they are they key , really , in the develo@@ ping world , as well as in the whole world , to the future of hum@@ ani@@ ty ."
"And if girls are in t@@ rou@@ ble because they face system@@ atic dis@@ adv@@ an@@ t@@ ages that keep them where society wan@@ ts them to be , inclu@@ ding l@@ ack of ac@@ cess to health@@ care , education , health@@ y fo@@ ods , lab@@ or force parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation ."
"The bur@@ den of all the hou@@ se@@ h@@ old t@@ as@@ ks usu@@ ally fal@@ ls on girls and youn@@ ger si@@ b@@ lin@@ gs , which en@@ su@@ res that they will never over@@ come these bar@@ r@@ ier@@ s ."
"The state of girls , the con@@ di@@ tion of girls , will , in my belie@@ f — and that &apos;s the girl inside us and the girl in the world — de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine whether the species survi@@ ves ."
"And what I want to su@@ ggest is that , having tal@@ ked to girls , because I just fini@@ shed a new book called &quot; I A@@ m an E@@ moti@@ onal C@@ re@@ ature : The Se@@ cre@@ t Li@@ fe of G@@ ir@@ ls A@@ round the World , &quot; I &apos;ve been talking to girls for five years , and one of the things that I &apos;ve seen is true every@@ where is that the ver@@ b that &apos;s been en@@ for@@ ced on girl is the ver@@ b &quot; &quot; to ple@@ ase . &quot; &quot; G@@ ir@@ ls are tra@@ ined to ple@@ ase ."
I want to change the ver@@ b .
I want us all to change the ver@@ b .
"I want the ver@@ b to be &quot; &quot; edu@@ cate , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; acti@@ v@@ ate , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; eng@@ age , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; con@@ front , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; de@@ fy , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; create . &quot; &quot; If we te@@ ach girls to change the ver@@ b we will actually en@@ force the girl inside us and the girl inside them ."
"And I have to now share a few stories of girls I &apos;ve seen across the planet who have eng@@ aged their girl , who have taken on their girl in spi@@ te of all the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces around them ."
"I know a 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old girl in the Ne@@ ther@@ l@@ ands , for example , who is de@@ man@@ ding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by her@@ self ."
There is a te@@ en@@ age girl who just re@@ cent@@ ly went out and knew that she needed 5@@ 6 star@@ s tat@@ to@@ o@@ ed on the right side of her face .
"There is a girl , Ju@@ li@@ a Bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ ly Hi@@ ll , who li@@ ved for a year in a t@@ ree because she wanted to prote@@ ct the wi@@ ld o@@ ak@@ s ."
There is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan who I have ad@@ op@@ ted as my d@@ aughter because her mother was kil@@ led . H@@ er mother was a re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary .
"And this girl , when she was 1@@ 7 years old , wor@@ e a bur@@ q@@ a in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , and went into the st@@ ad@@ i@@ um@@ s and do@@ cu@@ men@@ ted the at@@ ro@@ cities that were going on towar@@ ds women , under@@ ne@@ ath her bur@@ q@@ a , with a video ."
And that video became the video that went out all over the world after 9 / 11 to show what was going on in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan .
"I want to talk about R@@ ac@@ he@@ l C@@ or@@ r@@ ie who was in her te@@ ens when she sto@@ od in front of an Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li t@@ ank to say , &quot; &quot; E@@ nd the oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ation . &quot; &quot; And she knew she ri@@ sk@@ ed death and she was liter@@ ally g@@ un@@ ned down and rol@@ led over by that t@@ ank ."
"And I want to talk about a girl that I just met re@@ cent@@ ly in Bu@@ ka@@ v@@ u , who was im@@ pre@@ g@@ nat@@ ed by her ra@@ pi@@ st ."
And she was hol@@ ding her b@@ aby .
And I asked her if she lo@@ ved her b@@ aby .
"And she looked into her b@@ aby &apos;s eyes and she said , &quot; &quot; O@@ f course I love my b@@ aby . How could I not love my b@@ aby ?"
"It &apos;s my b@@ aby and it &apos;s full of love . &quot; &quot; The ca@@ pac@@ ity for girls to over@@ come situ@@ ations and to move on le@@ v@@ els , to me , is min@@ d-@@ b@@ low@@ ing ."
"There is a girl na@@ med D@@ or@@ c@@ as , and I just met her in Ken@@ ya ."
"D@@ or@@ c@@ as is 15 years old , and she was tra@@ ined in self-@@ def@@ en@@ se ."
A few months ago she was pi@@ cked up on the stre@@ et by three ol@@ der men .
"They ki@@ d@@ na@@ pped her , they put her in a car ."
"And through her self-@@ def@@ en@@ se , she gra@@ b@@ bed their A@@ d@@ am &apos;s app@@ les , she pun@@ ched them in the eyes and she got her@@ self f@@ ree and out of the car ."
"In Ken@@ ya , in Au@@ g@@ ust , I went to visi@@ t one of the V@@ -@@ D@@ ay sa@@ fe h@@ ous@@ es for girls , a house we open@@ ed seven years ago with an amazing woman na@@ med A@@ gn@@ es Par@@ ey@@ i@@ o ."
"A@@ gn@@ es was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl , she was fe@@ m@@ ale g@@ eni@@ t@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ lated ."
"And she made a deci@@ sion as many women do across this planet , that what was done to her would not be en@@ for@@ ced and done to other women and girls ."
"So , for years A@@ gn@@ es wal@@ ked through the Ri@@ ft val@@ ley ."
"S@@ he t@@ au@@ ght girls what a health@@ y v@@ ag@@ ina looked like , and what a mu@@ ti@@ lated v@@ ag@@ ina looked like ."
"And in that time she sa@@ ved many girls . And when we met her we asked her what we could do for her , and she said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you got me a Je@@ ep I could get around a lot f@@ ast@@ er . &quot; &quot; So , we got her a Je@@ ep . And then she sa@@ ved 4@@ ,@@ 500 girls ."
"And then we asked her , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , what else do you need ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Well , now , I need a house . &quot; &quot; So , seven years ago A@@ gn@@ es built the first V@@ -@@ D@@ ay sa@@ fe house in Na@@ rok , Ken@@ ya , in the M@@ as@@ a@@ i land ."
"And it was a house where girls could run away , they could sa@@ ve their c@@ lit@@ or@@ is , they wouldn &apos;t be cut , they could go to school ."
"And in the years that A@@ gn@@ es has had the house , she has changed the situ@@ ation there ."
She has liter@@ ally become de@@ pu@@ ty ma@@ y@@ or .
She &apos;s changed the ru@@ les .
The whole community has b@@ ou@@ ght in to what she &apos;s doing .
"When we were there she was doing a ri@@ tu@@ al where she re@@ con@@ ci@@ les girls , who have run away , with their fam@@ il@@ ies ."
And there was a young girl na@@ med J@@ ac@@ ly@@ n .
J@@ ac@@ ly@@ n was 14 years old and she was in her M@@ as@@ a@@ i family and there &apos;s a d@@ rought in Ken@@ ya .
"So c@@ ow@@ s are dy@@ ing , and c@@ ow@@ s are the most val@@ u@@ ed pos@@ s@@ es@@ sion ."
And J@@ ac@@ ly@@ n over@@ heard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to se@@ ll her for the c@@ ow@@ s .
And she knew that me@@ ant she would be cut .
She knew that me@@ ant she wouldn &apos;t go to school .
She knew that me@@ ant she wouldn &apos;t have a future .
"S@@ he knew she would have to mar@@ ry that old man , and she was 14 ."
"So , one af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , she &apos;d heard about the sa@@ fe house , J@@ ac@@ ly@@ n left her father &apos;s house and she wal@@ ked for two days , two days through M@@ as@@ a@@ i land ."
She s@@ lep@@ t with the hy@@ en@@ as . She hi@@ d at night .
"S@@ he imag@@ ined her father kil@@ ling her on one hand , and M@@ ama A@@ gn@@ es gre@@ e@@ ting her , with the hope that she would gre@@ et her when she got to the house ."
And when she got to the house she was gre@@ e@@ ted .
"A@@ gn@@ es took her in , and A@@ gn@@ es lo@@ ved her , and A@@ gn@@ es sup@@ por@@ ted her for the year ."
"S@@ he went to school and she found her vo@@ ice , and she found her iden@@ ti@@ ty , and she found her heart ."
"Th@@ en , her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation , after a year ."
I had the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of being in the hu@@ t when she was re@@ uni@@ ted with her father and re@@ con@@ ci@@ led .
"In that hu@@ t , we wal@@ ked in , and her father and his four wi@@ ves were sitting there , and her si@@ st@@ ers who had just re@@ turned because they had all f@@ led when she had f@@ led , and her pri@@ mar@@ y mother , who had been be@@ at@@ en in standing up for her with the el@@ ders ."
"When her father saw her and saw who she had become , in her full girl self , he thre@@ w his ar@@ ms around her and bro@@ ke down c@@ ry@@ ing ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; You are beautiful . You have grow@@ n into a gor@@ ge@@ ous woman ."
We will not cut you .
"And I give you my word , here and now , that we will not cut your si@@ st@@ ers either . &quot; &quot; And what she said to him was , &quot; &quot; You were wil@@ ling to se@@ ll me for four c@@ ow@@ s , and a cal@@ f and some bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ts ."
"But I pro@@ mi@@ se you , now that I will be edu@@ c@@ ated I will always take care of you , and I will come back and I will build you a house ."
"And I will be in your cor@@ ner for the rest of your life . &quot; &quot; F@@ or me , that is the power of girls ."
And that is the power of trans@@ form@@ ation .
I want to close today with a new piece from my book .
And I want to do it ton@@ ight for the girl in everybody here .
And I want to do it for S@@ uni@@ th@@ a .
"And I want to do it for the girls that S@@ uni@@ th@@ a tal@@ ked about y@@ est@@ er@@ day , the girls who survi@@ ve , the girls who can become somebody else ."
"But I really want to do it for each and every person here , to val@@ ue the girl in us , to val@@ ue the part that c@@ r@@ ies , to val@@ ue the part that &apos;s emoti@@ onal , to val@@ ue the part that &apos;s v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able , to understand that &apos;s where the future l@@ ies ."
"This is called &quot; &quot; I &apos;m A@@ n E@@ moti@@ onal C@@ re@@ ature . &quot; &quot; And it happened because I met a girl in W@@ at@@ ts , L@@ .@@ A@@ ."
"I was as@@ king girls if they like being a girl , and all the girls were like , &quot; &quot; No , I h@@ ate it . I can &apos;t stand it ."
"It &apos;s all bad . My bro@@ thers get everything . &quot; &quot; And this girl just s@@ at up and went , &quot; &quot; I love being a girl ."
I &apos;m an emoti@@ onal cre@@ ature ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is for her : I love being a girl .
I can feel what you &apos;re feeling as you &apos;re feeling inside the feeling before .
I am an emoti@@ onal cre@@ ature .
Th@@ ings do not come to me as in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al the@@ or@@ ies or har@@ d-@@ pres@@ sed ideas .
They pul@@ se through my or@@ g@@ ans and le@@ gs and bur@@ n up my ear@@ s .
"O@@ h , I know when your gir@@ l@@ friend &apos;s really pis@@ sed off , even though she ap@@ pe@@ ars to give you what you want ."
I know when a stor@@ m is coming .
I can feel the in@@ visi@@ ble sti@@ r@@ r@@ ings in the air .
I can tell you he won &apos;t call back . It &apos;s a vi@@ be I share .
I am an emoti@@ onal cre@@ ature .
I love that I do not take things li@@ gh@@ tly .
"E@@ very@@ thing is inten@@ se to me , the way I walk in the stre@@ et , the way my mom@@ ma wa@@ k@@ es me up , the way it &apos;s un@@ be@@ ar@@ able when I lo@@ se , the way I hear bad news ."
I am an emoti@@ onal cre@@ ature .
I am conne@@ cted to everything and everyone . I was born like that .
"D@@ on &apos;t you say all neg@@ ative that it &apos;s only only a te@@ en@@ age thing , or it &apos;s only because I &apos;m a girl ."
These feel@@ ings make me better .
They make me present . They make me ready . They make me stron@@ g .
I am an emoti@@ onal cre@@ ature .
There is a particular way of know@@ ing .
It &apos;s like the ol@@ der women some@@ how for@@ got .
I re@@ jo@@ ice that it &apos;s still in my body .
"O@@ h , I know when the co@@ con@@ u@@ t &apos;s about to f@@ all ."
I know we have p@@ us@@ h@@ ed the Earth too far .
"I know my father isn &apos;t coming back , and that no one &apos;s pre@@ par@@ ed for the fi@@ re ."
"I know that li@@ p@@ sti@@ ck means more than show , and bo@@ ys are su@@ per in@@ secu@@ re , and so@@ -@@ called ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sts are made , not born ."
I know that one k@@ is@@ s could take away all my deci@@ si@@ on-@@ making ability .
( Laughter ) And you know what ? S@@ ome@@ times it should .
"This is not extre@@ me . It &apos;s a girl thing , what we would all be if the big door inside us f@@ le@@ w open ."
"D@@ on &apos;t tell me not to c@@ ry , to cal@@ m it down , not to be so extre@@ me , to be reas@@ on@@ able ."
I am an emoti@@ onal cre@@ ature .
"It &apos;s how the ear@@ th got made , how the wind contin@@ u@@ es to pol@@ lin@@ ate ."
You don &apos;t tell the At@@ lan@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an to be@@ have .
I am an emoti@@ onal cre@@ ature .
Why would you want to sh@@ u@@ t me down or turn me off ?
I am your re@@ ma@@ ining memor@@ y .
I can take you back .
N@@ o@@ thing &apos;s been di@@ lu@@ ted .
N@@ o@@ thing &apos;s le@@ ak@@ ed out .
"I love , hear me , I love that I can feel the feel@@ ings inside you , even if they stop my life , even if they bre@@ ak my heart , even if they take me off tr@@ ack , they make me respon@@ si@@ ble ."
"I am an emoti@@ onal , I am an emoti@@ onal , in@@ con@@ d@@ oti@@ onal , de@@ v@@ oti@@ onal cre@@ ature ."
"And I love , hear me , I love , love , love being a girl ."
C@@ an you say it with me ?
"I love , I love , love , love being a girl !"
Thank you very much .

"We &apos;re here today to an@@ n@@ oun@@ ce the first syn@@ the@@ tic cell , a cell made by star@@ ting with the di@@ gi@@ tal c@@ od@@ e in the computer , building the chro@@ mo@@ some from four bot@@ t@@ les of chemi@@ cal@@ s , as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ling that chro@@ mo@@ some in ye@@ ast , tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ ting it into a re@@ ci@@ pie@@ n@@ t bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al cell and trans@@ form@@ ing that cell into a new bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al species ."
So this is the first self-@@ re@@ p@@ lic@@ ating species that we &apos;ve had on the planet wh@@ ose par@@ ent is a computer .
It also is the first species to have its own we@@ b@@ site en@@ c@@ od@@ ed in its gen@@ e@@ tic c@@ od@@ e .
But we &apos;ll talk more about the wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in a minu@@ te .
This is a project that had its in@@ cep@@ tion 15 years ago when our team then — we called the institu@@ te T@@ I@@ G@@ R — was inv@@ olved in sequ@@ en@@ cing the first two gen@@ om@@ es in history .
"We did Ha@@ emo@@ phi@@ lu@@ s in@@ flu@@ en@@ za@@ e and then the s@@ mal@@ l@@ est gen@@ ome of a self-@@ re@@ p@@ lic@@ ating organi@@ sm , that of M@@ y@@ cop@@ las@@ ma g@@ eni@@ t@@ ali@@ um ."
"And as so@@ on as we had these two sequ@@ ences we thought , if this is sup@@ posed to be the s@@ mal@@ l@@ est gen@@ ome of a self-@@ re@@ p@@ lic@@ ating species , could there be even a s@@ mal@@ ler gen@@ ome ?"
C@@ ould we understand the basi@@ s of cel@@ lu@@ lar life at the gen@@ e@@ tic level ?
"It &apos;s been a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ year qu@@ est just to get to the star@@ ting point now to be able to answer those questions , because it &apos;s very difficult to e@@ li@@ min@@ ate mul@@ ti@@ ple gen@@ es from a cell ."
You can only do them one at a time .
"We decided early on that we had to take a syn@@ the@@ tic rou@@ te , even though no@@ body had been there before , to see if we could syn@@ the@@ size a bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al chro@@ mo@@ some so we could actually v@@ ary the gen@@ e cont@@ ent to understand the essen@@ tial gen@@ es for life ."
That started our 1@@ 5@@ -@@ year qu@@ est to get here .
"But before we did the first experim@@ ents , we actually asked Ar@@ t C@@ a@@ pl@@ an &apos;s team at the Uni@@ versity of P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania to under@@ take a re@@ view of what the ri@@ sk@@ s , the challen@@ ges , the e@@ thi@@ cs around cre@@ ating new species in the labor@@ at@@ ory were because it ha@@ dn &apos;t been done before ."
They spent about two years re@@ vie@@ w@@ ing that in@@ depen@@ d@@ ently and publi@@ shed their resul@@ ts in S@@ cien@@ ce in 199@@ 9 .
"H@@ am and I took two years off as a side project to sequ@@ ence the human gen@@ ome , but as so@@ on as that was done we got back to the t@@ ask at hand ."
"In 200@@ 2 , we started a new institu@@ te , the In@@ stitu@@ te for Bi@@ ologi@@ cal E@@ ner@@ gy Al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves , where we set out two go@@ als : One , to understand the impac@@ t of our technology on the environment , and how to understand the environment better , and two , to start down this process of making syn@@ the@@ tic life to understand basi@@ c life ."
"In 200@@ 3 , we publi@@ shed our first suc@@ cess ."
So H@@ am S@@ mi@@ th and C@@ ly@@ de H@@ ut@@ ch@@ is@@ on develo@@ ped some new meth@@ ods for making er@@ ro@@ r@@ -@@ f@@ ree DNA at a small level .
"O@@ ur first t@@ ask was a 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ let@@ ter c@@ od@@ e bac@@ ter@@ i@@ op@@ ha@@ ge , a vi@@ ru@@ s that att@@ ac@@ ks only E@@ . col@@ i ."
"So that was the p@@ ha@@ ge ph@@ i X 1@@ 7@@ 4 , which was cho@@ s@@ en for histori@@ cal reas@@ ons ."
"It was the first DNA p@@ ha@@ ge , DNA vi@@ ru@@ s , DNA gen@@ ome that was actually sequ@@ en@@ ced ."
"So once we realized that we could make 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ b@@ ase pa@@ ir vi@@ r@@ al@@ -@@ si@@ zed pie@@ ces , we thought , we at least have the means then to try and make seri@@ ally lots of these pie@@ ces to be able to ev@@ en@@ tually as@@ se@@ m@@ ble them together to make this me@@ ga b@@ ase chro@@ mo@@ some ."
"So , sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally lar@@ ger than we even thought we would go ini@@ ti@@ ally ."
"There were se@@ ver@@ al ste@@ ps to this . There were two si@@ des : We had to sol@@ ve the chemi@@ stry for making large DNA mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les , and we had to sol@@ ve the biologi@@ cal side of how , if we had this new chemi@@ cal enti@@ ty , how would we bo@@ ot it up , acti@@ v@@ ate it in a re@@ ci@@ pie@@ n@@ t cell ."
"We had two te@@ am@@ s working in par@@ al@@ le@@ l : one team on the chemi@@ stry , and the other on trying to be able to tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant entire chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es to get new cells ."
"When we started this out , we thought the syn@@ the@@ sis would be the bi@@ ggest problem , which is why we cho@@ se the s@@ mal@@ l@@ est gen@@ ome ."
And some of you have noti@@ ced that we s@@ wit@@ ched from the s@@ mal@@ l@@ est gen@@ ome to a much lar@@ ger one .
"And we can walk through the reas@@ ons for that , but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get resul@@ ts from , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the lar@@ ger , f@@ ast@@ er@@ -@@ grow@@ ing cell takes only two days ."
So there &apos;s only so many cy@@ cles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cy@@ cle .
"And you should know that basically 9@@ 9 , probably 9@@ 9 percent p@@ lu@@ s of our experim@@ ents fai@@ led ."
"So this was a de@@ bu@@ gg@@ ing , proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ving scen@@ ari@@ o from the beginning because there was no re@@ ci@@ pe of how to get there ."
"So , one of the most important publi@@ c@@ ations we had was in 200@@ 7 ."
C@@ aro@@ le L@@ arti@@ gu@@ e led the ef@@ for@@ t to actually tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant a bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al chro@@ mo@@ some from one bac@@ ter@@ ia to another .
"I think phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ hi@@ cally , that was one of the most important pa@@ per@@ s that we &apos;ve ever done because it show@@ ed how dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c life was ."
"And we knew , once that worked , that we actually had a ch@@ ance if we could make the syn@@ the@@ tic chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es to do the same with those ."
We didn &apos;t know that it was going to take us se@@ ver@@ al years more to get there .
"In 200@@ 8 , we re@@ por@@ ted the comple@@ te syn@@ the@@ sis of the M@@ y@@ cop@@ las@@ ma g@@ eni@@ t@@ ali@@ um gen@@ ome , a little over 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 let@@ ters of gen@@ e@@ tic c@@ od@@ e , but we have not yet suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed in bo@@ ot@@ ing up that chro@@ mo@@ some ."
"We think in part , because of its s@@ low grow@@ th and , in part , cells have all kinds of uni@@ qu@@ e def@@ en@@ se mechani@@ s@@ ms to keep these ev@@ ents from happening ."
"It turned out the cell that we were trying to tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant into had a nu@@ cle@@ ase , an en@@ zy@@ me that ch@@ ew@@ s up DNA on its surface , and was happy to e@@ at the syn@@ the@@ tic DNA that we gave it and never got tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ t@@ ations ."
"But at the time , that was the largest mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le of a de@@ fin@@ ed structure that had been made ."
"And so both si@@ des were pro@@ gre@@ s@@ sing , but part of the syn@@ the@@ sis had to be ac@@ comp@@ li@@ shed or was able to be ac@@ comp@@ li@@ shed using ye@@ ast , pu@@ tting the fra@@ g@@ ments in ye@@ ast and ye@@ ast would as@@ se@@ m@@ ble these for us ."
"It &apos;s an amazing ste@@ p forward , but we had a problem because now we had the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es grow@@ ing in ye@@ ast ."
"So in ad@@ di@@ tion to doing the tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant , we had to find out how to get a bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al chro@@ mo@@ some out of the e@@ u@@ kar@@ y@@ oti@@ c ye@@ ast into a form where we could tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant it into a re@@ ci@@ pie@@ n@@ t cell ."
"So our team develo@@ ped new techni@@ qu@@ es for actually grow@@ ing , c@@ lon@@ ing entire bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es in ye@@ ast ."
"So we took the same my@@ co@@ ide@@ s gen@@ ome that C@@ aro@@ le had ini@@ ti@@ ally tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ ted , and we gre@@ w that in ye@@ ast as an arti@@ fi@@ cial chro@@ mo@@ some ."
And we thought this would be a great test bed for lear@@ ning how to get chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es out of ye@@ ast and tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant them .
"When we did these experim@@ ents , though , we could get the chro@@ mo@@ some out of ye@@ ast but it wouldn &apos;t tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant and bo@@ ot up a cell ."
That little issue took the team two years to sol@@ ve .
"It turns out , the DNA in the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al cell was actually meth@@ y@@ lated , and the meth@@ y@@ l@@ ation prote@@ cts it from the re@@ stri@@ ction en@@ zy@@ me , from di@@ g@@ est@@ ing the DNA ."
"So what we found is if we took the chro@@ mo@@ some out of ye@@ ast and meth@@ y@@ lated it , we could then tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant it ."
F@@ ur@@ ther adv@@ an@@ ces came when the team re@@ mo@@ ved the re@@ stri@@ ction en@@ zy@@ me gen@@ es from the re@@ ci@@ pie@@ n@@ t ca@@ pri@@ c@@ olu@@ m cell .
"And once we had done that , now we can take na@@ ked DNA out of ye@@ ast and tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant it ."
"So last f@@ all when we publi@@ shed the resul@@ ts of that work in S@@ cien@@ ce , we all became over@@ con@@ fi@@ dent and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now bo@@ ot up a chro@@ mo@@ some out of ye@@ ast ."
"Because of the problems with M@@ y@@ cop@@ las@@ ma g@@ eni@@ t@@ ali@@ um and its s@@ low grow@@ th about a year and a half ago , we decided to syn@@ the@@ size the much lar@@ ger chro@@ mo@@ some , the my@@ co@@ ide@@ s chro@@ mo@@ some , know@@ ing that we had the bio@@ logy worked out on that for tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ tation ."
And D@@ an led the team for the syn@@ the@@ sis of this over one@@ -@@ mi@@ lli@@ on-@@ b@@ ase pa@@ ir chro@@ mo@@ some .
"But it turned out it wasn &apos;t going to be as simple in the end , and it set us back three months because we had one er@@ ro@@ r out of over a million b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s in that sequ@@ ence ."
"So the team develo@@ ped new de@@ bu@@ gg@@ ing so@@ f@@ tw@@ are , where we could test each syn@@ the@@ tic fra@@ g@@ ment to see if it would gro@@ w in a back@@ ground of wi@@ ld ty@@ pe DNA ."
"And we found that 10 out of the 11 10@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ b@@ ase pa@@ ir pie@@ ces we syn@@ the@@ si@@ zed were completely ac@@ cur@@ ate and comp@@ ati@@ ble with a li@@ fe@@ -@@ form@@ ing sequ@@ ence ."
We nar@@ row@@ ed it down to one fra@@ g@@ ment ; we sequ@@ en@@ ced it and found just one b@@ ase pa@@ ir had been de@@ le@@ ted in an essen@@ tial gen@@ e .
So ac@@ cu@@ rac@@ y is essen@@ tial .
"There &apos;s par@@ ts of the gen@@ ome where it cannot t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate even a single er@@ ro@@ r , and then there &apos;s par@@ ts of the gen@@ ome where we can put in large blo@@ cks of DNA , as we did with the wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks , and it can t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate all kinds of er@@ ro@@ r@@ s ."
So it took about three months to find that er@@ ro@@ r and re@@ pa@@ ir it .
"And then early one morning , at 6 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
"@@ we got a te@@ xt from D@@ an saying that , now , the first blue col@@ on@@ ies ex@@ ist@@ ed ."
"So , it &apos;s been a long rou@@ te to get here : 15 years from the beginning ."
We felt one of the ten@@ ets of this fie@@ ld was to make absolu@@ tely certain we could di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ h syn@@ the@@ tic DNA from natural DNA .
"E@@ ar@@ ly on , when you &apos;re working in a new area of science , you have to think about all the pit@@ fal@@ ls and things that could le@@ ad you to believe that you had done something when you ha@@ dn &apos;t , and , even wor@@ se , le@@ ading others to believe it ."
"So , we thought the wor@@ st problem would be a single mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le cont@@ am@@ in@@ ation of the n@@ ative chro@@ mo@@ some , le@@ ading us to believe that we actually had created a syn@@ the@@ tic cell , when it would have been just a cont@@ am@@ in@@ ant ."
"So early on , we develo@@ ped the noti@@ on of pu@@ tting in wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in the DNA to absolu@@ tely make clear that the DNA was syn@@ the@@ tic ."
"And the first chro@@ mo@@ some we built in 200@@ 8 — the 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ b@@ ase pa@@ ir one — we simply as@@ sig@@ ned the na@@ mes of the au@@ th@@ ors of the chro@@ mo@@ some into the gen@@ e@@ tic c@@ od@@ e , but it was using just am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id single let@@ ter trans@@ l@@ ations , which lea@@ ves out certain let@@ ters of the al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t ."
So the team actually develo@@ ped a new c@@ od@@ e within the c@@ od@@ e within the c@@ od@@ e .
So it &apos;s a new c@@ od@@ e for inter@@ pre@@ ting and writing mess@@ ages in DNA .
"Now , ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ ans have been hi@@ ding and writing mess@@ ages in the gen@@ e@@ tic c@@ od@@ e for a long time , but it &apos;s clear they were ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ ans and not biologi@@ sts because , if you write long mess@@ ages with the c@@ od@@ e that the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ ans develo@@ ped , it would more than li@@ ke@@ ly le@@ ad to new prote@@ ins being syn@@ the@@ si@@ zed with un@@ known fun@@ ctions ."
"So the c@@ od@@ e that Mi@@ ke M@@ on@@ t@@ ag@@ ue and the team develo@@ ped actually pu@@ ts fre@@ qu@@ ent stop c@@ od@@ ons , so it &apos;s a different al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t but allow@@ s us to use the entire En@@ g@@ li@@ sh al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t with pun@@ ctu@@ ation and num@@ bers ."
"So , there are four major wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks all over 1@@ ,000 b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s of gen@@ e@@ tic c@@ od@@ e ."
The first one actually con@@ ta@@ ins within it this c@@ od@@ e for inter@@ pre@@ ting the rest of the gen@@ e@@ tic c@@ od@@ e .
"So in the re@@ ma@@ ining information , in the wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks , con@@ tain the na@@ mes of , I think it &apos;s 4@@ 6 different au@@ th@@ ors and key con@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ ors to getting the project to this st@@ age ."
"And we also built in a we@@ b@@ site ad@@ dre@@ ss so that if somebody de@@ co@@ des the c@@ od@@ e within the c@@ od@@ e within the c@@ od@@ e , they can sen@@ d an e@@ ma@@ il to that ad@@ dre@@ ss ."
"So it &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from any other species , having 4@@ 6 na@@ mes in it , its own we@@ b ad@@ dre@@ ss ."
"And we ad@@ ded three quot@@ ations , because with the first gen@@ ome we were cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for not trying to say something more pro@@ found than just sig@@ ning the work ."
"So we won &apos;t give the rest of the c@@ od@@ e , but we will give the three quot@@ ations ."
"The first is , &quot; &quot; To live , to er@@ r , to f@@ all , to tri@@ um@@ ph and to re@@ create life out of life . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a J@@ am@@ es Jo@@ y@@ ce quot@@ e ."
"The second quot@@ ation is , &quot; &quot; Se@@ e things not as they are , but as they might be . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a quot@@ e from the &quot; &quot; American Pro@@ me@@ the@@ us &quot; &quot; book on Rob@@ er@@ t O@@ pp@@ en@@ he@@ im@@ er ."
"And the last one is a Ri@@ ch@@ ard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man quot@@ e : &quot; &quot; What I cannot build , I cannot understand . &quot; &quot; So , because this is as much a phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ hi@@ cal adv@@ ance as a techni@@ cal adv@@ ance in science , we tr@@ ied to deal with both the phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ hi@@ cal and the techni@@ cal side ."
"The last thing I want to say before tur@@ ning it over to questions is that the ex@@ ten@@ sive work that we &apos;ve done — as@@ king for e@@ thi@@ cal re@@ view , p@@ us@@ h@@ ing the en@@ velo@@ pe on that side as well as the techni@@ cal side — this has been bro@@ ad@@ ly di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed in the scienti@@ fic community , in the poli@@ cy community and at the high@@ est le@@ v@@ els of the fe@@ der@@ al government ."
"E@@ ven with this an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ement , as we did in 200@@ 3 — that work was fun@@ ded by the De@@ part@@ ment of E@@ ner@@ gy , so the work was re@@ vie@@ w@@ ed at the level of the W@@ hi@@ te H@@ ou@@ se , trying to deci@@ de whether to clas@@ si@@ fy the work or publi@@ sh it ."
"And they came down on the side of open publi@@ cation , which is the right appro@@ ach — we &apos;ve br@@ ie@@ f@@ ed the W@@ hi@@ te H@@ ou@@ se , we &apos;ve br@@ ie@@ f@@ ed mem@@ bers of Con@@ gre@@ ss , we &apos;ve tr@@ ied to take and p@@ us@@ h the poli@@ cy issu@@ es in par@@ al@@ le@@ l with the scienti@@ fic adv@@ an@@ ces ."
"So with that , I would like to open it first to the flo@@ or for questions ."
"@@ Yes , in the back ."
"R@@ e@@ por@@ ter : C@@ ould you expla@@ in , in la@@ y@@ man &apos;s terms , how sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant a bre@@ ak@@ through this is ple@@ ase ?"
C@@ ra@@ i@@ g V@@ enter : C@@ an we expla@@ in how sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant this is ?
I &apos;m not sure we &apos;re the ones that should be expla@@ ining how sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant it is .
It &apos;s sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant to us .
P@@ er@@ haps it &apos;s a gi@@ ant phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ hi@@ cal change in how we view life .
"We actually view it as a b@@ aby ste@@ p in terms of , it &apos;s taken us 15 years to be able to do the experim@@ ent we wanted to do 15 years ago on under@@ standing life at its basi@@ c level ."
But we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of to@@ ols and we &apos;re already star@@ ting in num@@ er@@ ous av@@ en@@ u@@ es to use this to@@ ol .
"We have , at the In@@ stitu@@ te , on@@ going fun@@ ding now from N@@ I@@ H in a program with N@@ o@@ v@@ ar@@ t@@ is to try and use these new syn@@ the@@ tic DNA to@@ ols to per@@ haps make the f@@ lu vac@@ cine that you might get next year ."
"Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these , D@@ an &apos;s team can now make these in less than 2@@ 4 hours ."
"So when you see how long it took to get an H@@ 1@@ N@@ 1 vac@@ cine out , we think we can shor@@ ten that process quite sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally ."
"In the vac@@ cine area , Sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic G@@ en@@ omi@@ cs and the In@@ stitu@@ te are form@@ ing a new vac@@ cine company because we think these to@@ ols can af@@ fe@@ ct vac@@ cin@@ es to dise@@ ases that ha@@ ven &apos;t been possible to d@@ ate , things where the vi@@ rus@@ es ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly ev@@ ol@@ ve , such with r@@ h@@ in@@ o@@ vi@@ ru@@ s ."
W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be nice to have something that actually blo@@ cked common col@@ ds ?
"O@@ r , more import@@ an@@ tly , HIV , where the vi@@ ru@@ s ev@@ ol@@ ves so quickly the vac@@ cin@@ es that are made today can &apos;t keep up with those ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary chang@@ es ."
"A@@ l@@ so , at Sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic G@@ en@@ omi@@ cs , we &apos;ve been working on major environ@@ ment@@ al issu@@ es ."
I think this lat@@ est oil spi@@ ll in the G@@ ul@@ f is a re@@ min@@ der .
We can &apos;t see C@@ O@@ 2 — we de@@ p@@ end on scienti@@ fic meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments for it and we see the beginning resul@@ ts of having too much of it — but we can see pre@@ -@@ C@@ O@@ 2 now flo@@ ating on the wat@@ ers and cont@@ am@@ in@@ ating the be@@ ach@@ es in the G@@ ul@@ f .
We need some alter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves for oil .
"We have a program with E@@ x@@ x@@ on M@@ ob@@ ile to try and develo@@ p new stra@@ ins of al@@ ga@@ e that can ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ tly cap@@ ture car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de from the atmo@@ sp@@ here or from con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated sources , make new hy@@ dro@@ car@@ b@@ ons that can go into their re@@ fin@@ er@@ ies to make nor@@ mal g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine and d@@ ie@@ se@@ l fu@@ el out of C@@ O@@ 2 ."
Th@@ ose are just a couple of the appro@@ ach@@ es and dire@@ ctions that we &apos;re taking .
( Applause )
"You know , my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te part of being a d@@ ad is the mov@@ ies I get to wat@@ ch ."
"I love sh@@ aring my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te mov@@ ies with my kids , and when my d@@ aughter was four , we got to wat@@ ch &quot; &quot; The Wi@@ z@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; &quot; together ."
It tot@@ ally dom@@ in@@ ated her imag@@ in@@ ation for months .
"H@@ er fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te char@@ ac@@ ter was G@@ lin@@ da , of course ."
It gave her a great ex@@ c@@ use to we@@ ar a sp@@ ar@@ k@@ ly dre@@ ss and car@@ ry a w@@ and .
"But you wat@@ ch that movie enough times , and you start to realize how un@@ usu@@ al it is ."
"Now we live today , and are ra@@ is@@ ing our children , in a kind of children &apos;@@ s@@ -@@ fan@@ t@@ as@@ y@@ -@@ spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ u@@ lar@@ -@@ indu@@ stri@@ al comple@@ x ."
But &quot; &quot; The Wi@@ z@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; &quot; sto@@ od alone .
It did not start that tr@@ end .
"F@@ or@@ ty years later was when the tr@@ end really ca@@ u@@ ght on , with , interest@@ ing@@ ly , another movie that fe@@ at@@ u@@ red a me@@ tal guy and a f@@ ur@@ ry guy re@@ s@@ cu@@ ing a girl by dre@@ s@@ sing up as the ene@@ my &apos;s gu@@ ar@@ ds ."
Do you know what I &apos;m talking about ? ( Laughter ) Yeah .
"Now , there &apos;s a big difference between these two mov@@ ies , a couple of really big differ@@ ences between &quot; &quot; The Wi@@ z@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; &quot; and all the mov@@ ies we wat@@ ch today ."
"One is there &apos;s very little violence in &quot; &quot; The Wi@@ z@@ ard of O@@ z . &quot; &quot; The mon@@ ke@@ ys are rather ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sive , as are the app@@ le tre@@ es ."
"But I think if &quot; &quot; The Wi@@ z@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; &quot; were made today , the wiz@@ ard would say , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ ro@@ th@@ y , you are the sa@@ vi@@ or of O@@ z that the pro@@ p@@ he@@ cy fore@@ told ."
U@@ se your mag@@ ic sli@@ p@@ per@@ s to de@@ fe@@ at the compu@@ ter@@ -@@ gener@@ ated ar@@ mie@@ s of the Wi@@ cked W@@ it@@ ch . &quot; &quot; But that &apos;s not how it happens .
A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s really uni@@ qu@@ e about &quot; &quot; The Wi@@ z@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; &quot; to me is that all of the most her@@ o@@ ic and wi@@ se and even vi@@ l@@ la@@ in@@ ous char@@ ac@@ ters are fe@@ m@@ ale .
"Now I started to noti@@ ce this when I actually show@@ ed &quot; &quot; St@@ ar W@@ ars &quot; &quot; to my d@@ aughter , which was years later , and the situ@@ ation was different ."
A@@ t that point I also had a son .
He was only three at the time .
He was not in@@ vi@@ ted to the scre@@ ening . He was too young for that .
"But he was the second child , and the level of super@@ vision had p@@ lu@@ m@@ me@@ ted . ( Laughter ) So he wan@@ der@@ ed in , and it im@@ prin@@ ted on him like a mom@@ my du@@ ck does to its du@@ ck@@ ling , and I don &apos;t think he under@@ stan@@ ds what &apos;s going on , but he is sure so@@ aking in it ."
And I won@@ der what he &apos;s so@@ aking in .
Is he pi@@ c@@ king up on the the@@ mes of cou@@ ra@@ ge and per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance and lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty ?
Is he pi@@ c@@ king up on the fact that Lu@@ ke jo@@ ins an ar@@ my to over@@ th@@ row the government ? Is he pi@@ c@@ king up on the fact that
"@@ there are only bo@@ ys in the universe ex@@ cept for A@@ un@@ t B@@ er@@ u , and of course this prin@@ cess , who &apos;s really cool , but who kind of wa@@ its around through most of the movie so that she can aw@@ ard the her@@ o with a me@@ d@@ al and a win@@ k to th@@ ank him for sa@@ ving the universe , which he does by the mag@@ ic that he was born with ?"
C@@ om@@ p@@ are this to 19@@ 3@@ 9 with &quot; &quot; The Wi@@ z@@ ard of O@@ z . &quot; &quot; How does D@@ o@@ ro@@ th@@ y wi@@ n her movie ?
B@@ y making friends with everybody and being a lea@@ der .
"That &apos;s kind of the world I &apos;d rather ra@@ ise my kids in — O@@ z , right ? — and not the world of du@@ des fi@@ gh@@ ting , which is where we kind of have to be ."
"Wh@@ y is there so much F@@ or@@ ce — ca@@ pi@@ tal F , F@@ or@@ ce — in the mov@@ ies we have for our kids , and so little y@@ el@@ low bri@@ ck ro@@ ad ?"
"There is a lot of great writing about the impac@@ t that the bo@@ y@@ -@@ viol@@ ent movie has on girls , and you should do that re@@ ading . It &apos;s very good ."
I ha@@ ven &apos;t read as much on how bo@@ ys are pi@@ c@@ king up on this vi@@ be .
"I know from my own experience that P@@ r@@ in@@ cess Le@@ ia did not provi@@ de the a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate con@@ te@@ xt that I could have used in na@@ vi@@ g@@ ating the ad@@ ul@@ t world that is co@@ -@@ ed . ( Laughter ) I think there was a fir@@ st@@ -@@ k@@ is@@ s moment when I really expe@@ cted the cre@@ di@@ ts to start rol@@ ling because that &apos;s the end of the movie , right ?"
"I fini@@ shed my qu@@ est , I got the girl ."
Why are you still standing there ?
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m sup@@ posed to do .
"The mov@@ ies are very , very fo@@ c@@ used on de@@ fe@@ ating the vi@@ l@@ la@@ in and getting your re@@ ward , and there &apos;s not a lot of room for other relation@@ ships and other jour@@ ne@@ ys ."
"It &apos;s almost as though if you &apos;re a bo@@ y , you are a dop@@ ey ani@@ mal , and if you are a girl , you should bring your war@@ ri@@ or co@@ stu@@ me ."
"There are pl@@ en@@ ty of ex@@ cep@@ tions , and I will def@@ end the D@@ is@@ ney prin@@ cess@@ es in front of any you ."
"But they do sen@@ d a mess@@ age to bo@@ ys , that they are not , the bo@@ ys are not really the tar@@ get audience ."
"They are doing a ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al job of teach@@ ing girls how to def@@ end against the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ chy , but they are not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly show@@ ing bo@@ ys how they &apos;re sup@@ posed to def@@ end against the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ chy ."
There &apos;s no mode@@ ls for them .
"And we also have some terri@@ fic women who are writing new stories for our kids , and as thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal and deli@@ gh@@ t@@ ful as H@@ er@@ mi@@ one and K@@ at@@ ni@@ ss are , these are still war mov@@ ies ."
"And , of course , the most suc@@ cess@@ ful studi@@ o of all time contin@@ u@@ es to c@@ ran@@ k out clas@@ si@@ c after clas@@ si@@ c , every single one of them about the jour@@ ney of a bo@@ y , or a man , or two men who are friends , or a man and his son , or two men who are ra@@ is@@ ing a little girl ."
"U@@ n@@ til , as many of you are thinking , this year , when they finally came out with &quot; &quot; Bra@@ ve . &quot; &quot; I re@@ comm@@ end it to all of you . It &apos;s on de@@ m@@ and now ."
Do you remember what the cri@@ ti@@ cs said when &quot; &quot; Bra@@ ve &quot; &quot; came out ?
"&quot; A@@ w , I can &apos;t believe P@@ i@@ x@@ ar made a prin@@ cess movie . &quot;"
It &apos;s very good . D@@ on &apos;t let that stop you .
"Now , almost n@@ one of these mov@@ ies pas@@ s the Be@@ ch@@ de@@ l T@@ est ."
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard of this .
"It has not yet ca@@ u@@ ght on and ca@@ u@@ ght fi@@ re , but maybe today we will start a movement ."
"A@@ li@@ son Be@@ ch@@ de@@ l is a com@@ ic book arti@@ st , and back in the mi@@ d@@ - &apos; 8@@ 0s , she recor@@ ded this convers@@ ation she &apos;d had with a friend about as@@ s@@ ess@@ ing the mov@@ ies that they saw ."
And it &apos;s very simple . There &apos;s just three questions you should ask : Is there more than one char@@ ac@@ ter in the movie that is fe@@ m@@ ale who has lin@@ es ?
So try to me@@ et that b@@ ar .
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie ?
And is their convers@@ ation about something other than the guy that they both like ? ( Laughter ) R@@ ight ? Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much .
T@@ wo women who exi@@ st and talk to each other about stuff .
"It does happen . I &apos;ve seen it , and yet I very r@@ are@@ ly see it in the mov@@ ies that we know and love ."
"In fact , this week I went to see a very high-@@ qu@@ ality movie , &quot; &quot; Ar@@ go . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ? O@@ s@@ car bu@@ z@@ z , doing great at the box offi@@ ce , a con@@ sen@@ su@@ s idea of what a qu@@ ality H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood film is ."
It pretty much flu@@ n@@ ks the Be@@ ch@@ de@@ l test .
"And I don &apos;t think it should , because a lot of the movie , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve seen it , but a lot of the movie takes place in this em@@ bas@@ sy where men and women are hi@@ ding out during the h@@ ost@@ age cri@@ sis ."
"We &apos;ve got quite a few scen@@ es of the men having de@@ ep , ang@@ st@@ -@@ ri@@ d@@ den convers@@ ations in this hi@@ de@@ out , and the great moment for one of the ac@@ tre@@ s@@ ses is to pe@@ ek through the door and say , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you coming to bed , hon@@ ey ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood for you ."
So let &apos;s look at the num@@ bers .
"@@ 20@@ 11 , of the 100 most popul@@ ar mov@@ ies , how many of them do you think actually have fe@@ m@@ ale pro@@ t@@ ag@@ on@@ ist@@ s ?"
E@@ le@@ ven . It &apos;s not bad .
"It &apos;s not as many percent as the number of women we &apos;ve just ele@@ cted to Con@@ gre@@ ss , so that &apos;s good ."
But there is a number that is gre@@ ater than this that &apos;s going to bring this room down .
"L@@ ast year , The New York T@@ im@@ es publi@@ shed a study that the government had done ."
Here &apos;s what it said .
One out of five women in America say that they have been se@@ x@@ u@@ ally as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted some time in their life .
"Now , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the f@@ au@@ l@@ t of popul@@ ar en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment ."
I don &apos;t think kids &apos; mov@@ ies have anything to do with that .
"I don &apos;t even think that music vi@@ de@@ os or por@@ no@@ gra@@ ph@@ y are really dire@@ ct@@ ly re@@ lated to that , but something is going wrong , and when I hear that st@@ ati@@ stic , one of the things I think of is that &apos;s a lot of se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ il@@ an@@ ts ."
Wh@@ o are these guys ? What are they lear@@ ning ?
What are they fa@@ il@@ ing to learn ?
"A@@ re they ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing the story that a m@@ ale her@@ o &apos;s job is to de@@ fe@@ at the vi@@ l@@ la@@ in with violence and then colle@@ ct the re@@ ward , which is a woman who has no friends and doesn &apos;t speak ?"
A@@ re we so@@ aking up that story ?
"You know , as a par@@ ent with the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of ra@@ is@@ ing a d@@ aughter like all of you who are doing the same thing , we find this world and this st@@ ati@@ stic very al@@ ar@@ ming and we want to pre@@ p@@ are them ."
"We have to@@ ols at our di@@ spos@@ al like &quot; &quot; girl power , &quot; &quot; and we hope that that will help , but I got@@ ta won@@ der , is girl power going to prote@@ ct them if , at the same time , acti@@ vely or pas@@ si@@ vely , we are tra@@ ining our s@@ ons to ma@@ in@@ tain their bo@@ y power ?"
"I mean , I think the N@@ et@@ fli@@ x qu@@ e@@ ue is one way that we can do something very important , and I &apos;m talking ma@@ in@@ ly to the d@@ ads here ."
I think we have got to show our s@@ ons a new defini@@ tion of man@@ ho@@ od .
The defini@@ tion of man@@ ho@@ od is already tur@@ ning up@@ side down .
You &apos;ve read about how the new econom@@ y is chang@@ ing the ro@@ les of car@@ e@@ gi@@ ver and wa@@ ge ear@@ ner .
They &apos;re th@@ row@@ ing it up in the air .
"So our s@@ ons are going to have to find some way of ad@@ ap@@ ting to this , some new relation@@ ship with each other , and I think we really have to show them , and model for them , how a real man is someone who tru@@ sts his si@@ st@@ ers and re@@ spe@@ cts them , and wan@@ ts to be on their team , and stan@@ ds up against the real bad guys , who are the men who want to ab@@ use the women ."
"And I think our job in the N@@ et@@ fli@@ x qu@@ e@@ ue is to look out for those mov@@ ies that pas@@ s the Be@@ ch@@ de@@ l T@@ est , if we can find them , and to se@@ ek out the her@@ o@@ ines who are there , who show real cou@@ ra@@ ge , who bring people together , and to nu@@ dge our s@@ ons to iden@@ ti@@ fy with those her@@ o@@ ines and to say , &quot; &quot; I want to be on their team , &quot; &quot; because they &apos;re going to be on their team ."
"When I asked my d@@ aughter who her fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te char@@ ac@@ ter was in &quot; &quot; St@@ ar W@@ ars , &quot; &quot; do you know what she said ?"
O@@ bi@@ -@@ W@@ an .
O@@ bi@@ -@@ W@@ an Ken@@ ob@@ i and G@@ lin@@ da .
What do these two have in common ?
Ma@@ ybe it &apos;s not just the sp@@ ar@@ k@@ ly dre@@ ss .
I think these people are exper@@ ts .
"I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than any@@ body else , and they love sh@@ aring their know@@ le@@ dge with other people to help them re@@ ach their poten@@ tial ."
"Now , they are le@@ ad@@ ers ."
"I like that kind of qu@@ est for my d@@ aughter , and I like that kind of qu@@ est for my son ."
I want more qu@@ est@@ s like that .
"I want fe@@ wer qu@@ est@@ s where my son is told , &quot; G@@ o out and fi@@ ght it alone , &quot; and more qu@@ est@@ s where he se@@ es that it &apos;s his job to jo@@ in a team , maybe a team led by women , to help other people become better and be better people , like the Wi@@ z@@ ard of O@@ z ."
Thank you .
I &apos;d like to tell you about a leg@@ al case that I worked on inv@@ ol@@ ving a man na@@ med Ste@@ ve Ti@@ tu@@ s .
Ti@@ tu@@ s was a re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant man@@ ag@@ er .
"He was 3@@ 1 years old , he li@@ ved in Se@@ at@@ tle , W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , he was eng@@ aged to Gre@@ t@@ ch@@ en , about to be mar@@ ried , she was the love of his life ."
"And one night , the couple went out for a ro@@ man@@ tic re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant me@@ al ."
"They were on their way home , and they were pul@@ led over by a poli@@ ce offi@@ cer ."
"You see , Ti@@ tu@@ s &apos; car sort of re@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ led a car that was dri@@ ven ear@@ lie@@ r in the ev@@ ening by a man who ra@@ ped a fe@@ m@@ ale hi@@ t@@ ch@@ hi@@ k@@ er , and Ti@@ tu@@ s kind of re@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ led that ra@@ pi@@ st ."
"So the poli@@ ce took a picture of Ti@@ tu@@ s , they put it in a ph@@ oto lin@@ e@@ up , they later show@@ ed it to the vi@@ cti@@ m , and she poin@@ ted to Ti@@ tu@@ s &apos; ph@@ oto ."
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; That one &apos;s the clo@@ s@@ est . &quot; &quot; The poli@@ ce and the pro@@ secu@@ tion pro@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed with a tri@@ al , and when Ste@@ ve Ti@@ tu@@ s was put on tri@@ al for ra@@ pe , the ra@@ pe vi@@ cti@@ m got on the stand and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m absolu@@ tely posi@@ tive that &apos;s the man . &quot; &quot; And Ti@@ tu@@ s was con@@ vi@@ cted ."
"He pro@@ c@@ la@@ im@@ ed his in@@ no@@ cen@@ ce , his family scre@@ am@@ ed at the j@@ ury , his fi@@ an@@ c@@ é@@ e col@@ lap@@ sed on the flo@@ or sob@@ b@@ ing , and Ti@@ tu@@ s is taken away to ja@@ il ."
So what would you do at this point ?
What would you do ?
"Well , Ti@@ tu@@ s lost comple@@ te fai@@ th in the leg@@ al system , and yet he got an idea ."
"He called up the local ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er , he got the inter@@ est of an inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ative jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st , and that jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st actually found the real ra@@ pi@@ st , a man who ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely con@@ f@@ ess@@ ed to this ra@@ pe , a man who was thought to have com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted 50 ra@@ p@@ es in that area , and when this information was given to the ju@@ dge , the ju@@ dge set Ti@@ tu@@ s f@@ ree ."
"And really , that &apos;s where this case should have en@@ ded ."
It should have been over .
"T@@ i@@ tu@@ s should have thought of this as a hor@@ ri@@ ble year , a year of ac@@ c@@ us@@ ation and tri@@ al , but over ."
It didn &apos;t end that way .
Ti@@ tu@@ s was so bi@@ t@@ ter .
He &apos;d lost his job . He couldn &apos;t get it back .
He lost his fi@@ an@@ c@@ é@@ e .
She couldn &apos;t put up with his per@@ si@@ st@@ ent ang@@ er .
"He lost his entire sa@@ v@@ ings , and so he decided to fi@@ le a l@@ aw@@ su@@ it against the poli@@ ce and others wh@@ om he felt were respon@@ si@@ ble for his su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing ."
"And that &apos;s when I really started working on this case , trying to figure out how did that vi@@ cti@@ m go from &quot; That one &apos;s the clo@@ s@@ est &quot; to &quot; &quot; I &apos;m absolu@@ tely posi@@ tive that &apos;s the guy . &quot; &quot; Well , Ti@@ tu@@ s was con@@ sum@@ ed with his ci@@ vi@@ l case ."
"He spent every wa@@ king moment thinking about it , and just days before he was to have his day in cour@@ t , he wo@@ ke up in the morning , d@@ ou@@ b@@ led over in pa@@ in , and d@@ ied of a stre@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ re@@ lated heart att@@ ack ."
He was 3@@ 5 years old .
So I was asked to work on Ti@@ tu@@ s &apos; case because I &apos;m a psycho@@ logi@@ cal scienti@@ st .
I study memor@@ y . I &apos;ve stud@@ ied memor@@ y for de@@ ca@@ des .
"And if I me@@ et somebody on an air@@ pl@@ ane — this happened on the way over to S@@ c@@ ot@@ land — if I me@@ et somebody on an air@@ pl@@ ane , and we ask each other , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? What do you do ? &quot; &quot; and I say &quot; &quot; I study memor@@ y , &quot; &quot; they usu@@ ally want to tell me how they have t@@ rou@@ ble re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing na@@ mes , or they &apos;ve got a rel@@ ative who &apos;s got Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s or some kind of memor@@ y problem , but I have to tell them I don &apos;t study when people for@@ get ."
"I study the op@@ posi@@ te : when they remember , when they remember things that didn &apos;t happen or remember things that were different from the way they really were ."
I study fal@@ se memor@@ ies .
"U@@ n@@ ha@@ p@@ pi@@ ly , Ste@@ ve Ti@@ tu@@ s is not the only person to be con@@ vi@@ cted based on somebody &apos;s fal@@ se memor@@ y ."
"In one project in the United States , information has been ga@@ ther@@ ed on 3@@ 00 in@@ no@@ cent people , 3@@ 00 def@@ en@@ dan@@ ts who were con@@ vi@@ cted of cri@@ mes they didn &apos;t do ."
"They spent 10 , 20 , 30 years in pri@@ son for these cri@@ mes , and now DNA test@@ ing has pro@@ ven that they are actually in@@ no@@ cent ."
"And when those c@@ ases have been an@@ al@@ y@@ zed , three qu@@ ar@@ ters of them are du@@ e to f@@ au@@ l@@ ty memor@@ y , f@@ au@@ l@@ ty e@@ ye@@ wit@@ ness memor@@ y ."
"Well , why ?"
"L@@ i@@ ke the ju@@ ro@@ r@@ s who con@@ vi@@ cted those in@@ no@@ cent people and the ju@@ ro@@ r@@ s who con@@ vi@@ cted Ti@@ tu@@ s , many people believe that memor@@ y works like a recor@@ ding de@@ vice ."
"You just recor@@ d the information , then you call it up and play it back when you want to answer questions or iden@@ ti@@ fy images ."
But de@@ ca@@ des of work in psycho@@ logy has sh@@ own that this just isn &apos;t true .
O@@ ur memor@@ ies are con@@ stru@@ ctive .
They &apos;re re@@ con@@ stru@@ ctive .
"M@@ e@@ mor@@ y works a little bit more like a Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ age : You can go in there and change it , but so can other people ."
I first started stu@@ dy@@ ing this con@@ stru@@ ctive memor@@ y process in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s .
I did my experim@@ ents that inv@@ olved show@@ ing people si@@ mu@@ lated cri@@ mes and ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents and as@@ king them questions about what they remember .
"In one study , we show@@ ed people a si@@ mu@@ lated ac@@ ci@@ dent and we asked people , how f@@ ast were the cars going when they h@@ it each other ?"
"And we asked other people , how f@@ ast were the cars going when they s@@ mas@@ h@@ ed into each other ?"
"And if we asked the le@@ ading &quot; &quot; s@@ mas@@ h@@ ed &quot; &quot; question , the wit@@ n@@ ess@@ es told us the cars were going f@@ ast@@ er , and mo@@ re@@ over , that le@@ ading &quot; &quot; s@@ mas@@ h@@ ed &quot; &quot; question ca@@ used people to be more li@@ ke@@ ly to tell us that they saw bro@@ k@@ en gl@@ as@@ s in the ac@@ ci@@ dent scen@@ e when there wasn &apos;t any bro@@ k@@ en gl@@ as@@ s at all ."
"In another study , we show@@ ed a si@@ mu@@ lated ac@@ ci@@ dent where a car went through an inter@@ se@@ ction with a stop sig@@ n , and if we asked a question that in@@ sin@@ u@@ ated it was a y@@ ie@@ ld sig@@ n , many wit@@ n@@ ess@@ es told us they remember seeing a y@@ ie@@ ld sig@@ n at the inter@@ se@@ ction , not a stop sig@@ n ."
"And you might be thinking , well , you know , these are fil@@ med ev@@ ents , they are not parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly stre@@ s@@ s@@ ful ."
W@@ ould the same kind of mist@@ ak@@ es be made with a really stre@@ s@@ s@@ ful ev@@ ent ?
"In a study we publi@@ shed just a few months ago , we have an answer to this question , because what was un@@ usu@@ al about this study is we ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ed for people to have a very stre@@ s@@ s@@ ful experience ."
The sub@@ je@@ cts in this study were mem@@ bers of the U.@@ S. mi@@ lit@@ ary who were under@@ going a har@@ row@@ ing tra@@ ining ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se to te@@ ach them what it &apos;s going to be like for them if they are ever cap@@ tu@@ red as pri@@ son@@ ers of war .
"And as part of this tra@@ ining ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se , these sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s are inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated in an ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sive , h@@ ost@@ ile , physi@@ cally ab@@ u@@ sive fas@@ hi@@ on for 30 minutes and later on they have to try to iden@@ ti@@ fy the person who con@@ du@@ cted that inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation ."
"And when we fe@@ ed them su@@ gg@@ esti@@ ve information that in@@ sin@@ u@@ ates it &apos;s a different person , many of them mi@@ si@@ den@@ ti@@ fy their inter@@ ro@@ gat@@ or , often iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ying someone who doesn &apos;t even re@@ mot@@ ely re@@ se@@ m@@ ble the real inter@@ ro@@ gat@@ or ."
"And so what these stud@@ ies are show@@ ing is that when you fe@@ ed people mis@@ information about some experience that they may have had , you can di@@ stor@@ t or cont@@ am@@ in@@ ate or change their memor@@ y ."
"Well out there in the real world , mis@@ information is every@@ where ."
"We get mis@@ information not only if we &apos;re questi@@ on@@ ed in a le@@ ading way , but if we talk to other wit@@ n@@ ess@@ es who might con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously or in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently fe@@ ed us some er@@ ro@@ ne@@ ous information , or if we see media co@@ ver@@ age about some ev@@ ent we might have exper@@ ien@@ ced , all of these provi@@ de the opportunity for this kind of cont@@ am@@ in@@ ation of our memor@@ y ."
"In the 199@@ 0s , we began to see an even more extre@@ me kind of memor@@ y problem ."
"S@@ ome patients were going into ther@@ ap@@ y with one problem — maybe they had de@@ pres@@ sion , an e@@ ating di@@ sor@@ der — and they were coming out of ther@@ ap@@ y with a different problem ."
"E@@ x@@ tre@@ me memor@@ ies for hor@@ ri@@ fic bru@@ t@@ aliz@@ ations , sometimes in s@@ at@@ ani@@ c ri@@ tu@@ als , sometimes inv@@ ol@@ ving really bi@@ zar@@ re and un@@ usu@@ al ele@@ ments ."
"One woman came out of psycho@@ ther@@ ap@@ y belie@@ ving that she &apos;d en@@ du@@ red years of ri@@ tu@@ ali@@ stic ab@@ use , where she was for@@ ced into a pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy and that the b@@ aby was cut from her be@@ lly ."
But there were no physi@@ cal sc@@ ars or any kind of physi@@ cal evi@@ dence that could have sup@@ por@@ ted her story .
"And when I began looking into these c@@ ases , I was wonder@@ ing , where do these bi@@ zar@@ re memor@@ ies come from ?"
And what I found is that most of these situ@@ ations inv@@ olved some particular form of psycho@@ ther@@ ap@@ y .
"And so I asked , were some of the things going on in this psycho@@ ther@@ ap@@ y — like the imag@@ in@@ ation ex@@ er@@ ci@@ ses or dre@@ am inter@@ pret@@ ation , or in some c@@ ases hy@@ p@@ no@@ sis , or in some c@@ ases ex@@ pos@@ ure to fal@@ se information — were these le@@ ading these patients to develo@@ p these very bi@@ zar@@ re , un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly memor@@ ies ?"
And I desig@@ ned some experim@@ ents to try to study the pro@@ cess@@ es that were being used in this psycho@@ ther@@ ap@@ y so I could study the develo@@ pment of these very ri@@ ch fal@@ se memor@@ ies .
"In one of the first stud@@ ies we did , we used su@@ gg@@ esti@@ on , a meth@@ od inspi@@ red by the psycho@@ ther@@ ap@@ y we saw in these c@@ ases , we used this kind of su@@ gg@@ esti@@ on and plan@@ ted a fal@@ se memor@@ y that when you were a kid , five or six years old , you were lost in a sh@@ op@@ ping mall ."
You were f@@ ri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed . You were c@@ ry@@ ing .
You were ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely re@@ s@@ cu@@ ed by an el@@ der@@ ly person and re@@ uni@@ ted with the family .
And we suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed in plan@@ ting this memor@@ y in the min@@ ds of about a qu@@ ar@@ ter of our sub@@ je@@ cts .
"And you might be thinking , well , that &apos;s not parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly stre@@ s@@ s@@ ful ."
But we and other inv@@ esti@@ gat@@ ors have plan@@ ted ri@@ ch fal@@ se memor@@ ies of things that were much more un@@ usu@@ al and much more stre@@ s@@ s@@ ful .
"So in a study done in T@@ en@@ n@@ es@@ see , resear@@ ch@@ ers plan@@ ted the fal@@ se memor@@ y that when you were a kid , you ne@@ ar@@ ly d@@ row@@ ned and had to be re@@ s@@ cu@@ ed by a life gu@@ ard ."
"And in a study done in C@@ an@@ ada , resear@@ ch@@ ers plan@@ ted the fal@@ se memor@@ y that when you were a kid , something as aw@@ ful as being att@@ ac@@ ked by a vi@@ ci@@ ous ani@@ mal happened to you , suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ding with about half of their sub@@ je@@ cts ."
"And in a study done in I@@ tal@@ y , resear@@ ch@@ ers plan@@ ted the fal@@ se memor@@ y , when you were a kid , you wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed de@@ mon@@ ic pos@@ s@@ es@@ sion ."
"I do want to ad@@ d that it might se@@ em like we are tra@@ um@@ ati@@ z@@ ing these experim@@ ent@@ al sub@@ je@@ cts in the name of science , but our stud@@ ies have gone through th@@ o@@ rou@@ gh ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation by research e@@ thi@@ cs bo@@ ar@@ ds that have made the deci@@ sion that the tem@@ por@@ ary dis@@ comfor@@ t that some of these sub@@ je@@ cts might experience in these stud@@ ies is out@@ we@@ igh@@ ed by the import@@ ance of this problem for under@@ standing memor@@ y pro@@ cess@@ es and the ab@@ use of memor@@ y that is going on in some places in the world ."
"Well , to my sur@@ pri@@ se , when I publi@@ shed this work and began to speak out against this particular br@@ and of psycho@@ ther@@ ap@@ y , it created some pretty bad problems for me : h@@ ost@@ i@@ lit@@ ies , pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly from the re@@ pres@@ sed memor@@ y ther@@ a@@ pi@@ sts , who felt under att@@ ack , and by the patients wh@@ om they had in@@ flu@@ en@@ ced ."
"I had sometimes ar@@ med gu@@ ar@@ ds at spe@@ ech@@ es that I was in@@ vi@@ ted to give , people trying to dru@@ m up let@@ ter@@ -@@ writing cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ns to get me fi@@ red ."
But probably the wor@@ st was I s@@ us@@ pe@@ cted that a woman was in@@ no@@ cent of ab@@ use that was being c@@ la@@ im@@ ed by her grow@@ n d@@ aughter .
She ac@@ c@@ used her mother of se@@ x@@ u@@ al ab@@ use based on a re@@ pres@@ sed memor@@ y .
And this ac@@ c@@ using d@@ aughter had actually allow@@ ed her story to be fil@@ med and pre@@ sen@@ ted in public places .
"I was s@@ us@@ pi@@ ci@@ ous of this story , and so I started to inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ate , and ev@@ en@@ tually found information that con@@ v@@ in@@ ced me that this mother was in@@ no@@ cent ."
"I publi@@ shed an ex@@ pos@@ é on the case , and a little while later , the ac@@ c@@ using d@@ aughter fi@@ led a l@@ aw@@ su@@ it ."
"E@@ ven though I &apos;d never men@@ tion@@ ed her name , she su@@ ed me for de@@ fam@@ ation and inv@@ a@@ sion of pri@@ vac@@ y ."
"And I went through ne@@ ar@@ ly five years of de@@ al@@ ing with this mess@@ y , un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant li@@ ti@@ g@@ ation , but finally , finally , it was over and I could really get back to my work ."
"In the process , h@@ ow@@ ever , I became part of a di@@ st@@ urb@@ ing tr@@ end in America where scienti@@ sts are being su@@ ed for simply spe@@ aking out on mat@@ ters of great public contro@@ vers@@ y ."
"When I got back to my work , I asked this question : if I pl@@ ant a fal@@ se memor@@ y in your mind , does it have re@@ per@@ c@@ us@@ sions ?"
"D@@ o@@ es it af@@ fe@@ ct your later thou@@ ghts , your later behavi@@ ors ?"
"O@@ ur first study plan@@ ted a fal@@ se memor@@ y that you got si@@ ck as a child e@@ ating certain fo@@ ods : har@@ d-@@ bo@@ i@@ led e@@ g@@ gs , di@@ ll pi@@ ck@@ les , st@@ raw@@ ber@@ ry ice cre@@ am ."
"And we found that once we plan@@ ted this fal@@ se memor@@ y , people didn &apos;t want to e@@ at the fo@@ ods as much at an out@@ door pi@@ c@@ nic ."
The fal@@ se memor@@ ies ar@@ en &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly bad or un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant .
"If we plan@@ ted a war@@ m , fu@@ z@@ zy memor@@ y inv@@ ol@@ ving a health@@ y food like as@@ par@@ ag@@ us , we could get people to want to e@@ at as@@ par@@ ag@@ us more ."
And so what these stud@@ ies are show@@ ing is that you can pl@@ ant fal@@ se memor@@ ies and they have re@@ per@@ c@@ us@@ sions that af@@ fe@@ ct behavi@@ or long after the memor@@ ies take h@@ old .
"Well , along with this ability to pl@@ ant memor@@ ies and control behavi@@ or obvi@@ ously come some important e@@ thi@@ cal issu@@ es , like , when should we use this mind technology ?"
And should we ever b@@ an its use ?
"Th@@ er@@ a@@ pi@@ sts can &apos;t e@@ thi@@ cally pl@@ ant fal@@ se memor@@ ies in the mind of their patients even if it would help the patien@@ t , but there &apos;s nothing to stop a par@@ ent from trying this out on their over@@ we@@ ight or ob@@ ese te@@ en@@ ag@@ er ."
"And when I su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed this publi@@ c@@ ly , it created an out@@ c@@ ry again ."
&quot; There she goes . She &apos;s adv@@ oc@@ ating that parents lie to their children . &quot;
"H@@ el@@ l@@ o , S@@ an@@ ta C@@ l@@ au@@ s . ( Laughter ) I mean , another way to think about this is , which would you rather have , a kid with obe@@ sity , di@@ a@@ be@@ tes , shor@@ ten@@ ed li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an , all the things that go with it , or a kid with one little ex@@ tra bit of fal@@ se memor@@ y ?"
I know what I would cho@@ ose for a kid of m@@ ine .
But maybe my work has made me different from most people .
"Mo@@ st people ch@@ eri@@ sh their memor@@ ies , know that they re@@ present their iden@@ ti@@ ty , who they are , where they came from ."
And I ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate that . I feel that way too .
But I know from my work how much fi@@ ction is already in there .
"If I &apos;ve learned anything from these de@@ ca@@ des of working on these problems , it &apos;s this : just because somebody tel@@ ls you something and they say it with con@@ fi@@ dence , just because they say it with lots of de@@ ta@@ il , just because they ex@@ pre@@ ss emoti@@ on when they say it , it doesn &apos;t mean that it really happened ."
We can &apos;t reli@@ ably di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ h true memor@@ ies from fal@@ se memor@@ ies .
We need in@@ depen@@ dent cor@@ rob@@ or@@ ation .
Su@@ ch a disco@@ very has made me more t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant of the every@@ day memor@@ y mist@@ ak@@ es that my friends and family mem@@ bers make .
"S@@ u@@ ch a disco@@ very might have sa@@ ved Ste@@ ve Ti@@ tu@@ s , the man wh@@ ose whole future was s@@ nat@@ ched away by a fal@@ se memor@@ y ."
"But me@@ an@@ while , we should all keep in mind , we &apos;d do well to , that memor@@ y , like li@@ ber@@ ty , is a fra@@ gi@@ le thing ."
Thank you . Thank you .

"For the last three years , I was sho@@ ot@@ ing the ear@@ th for the movie ."
The name of the movie is &quot; &quot; H@@ ome &quot; &quot; — &quot; Ma@@ is@@ on . &quot;
It is about the state of the planet .
It &apos;s a fanta@@ stic story of life on the ear@@ th .
I &apos;m very pro@@ u@@ d to show you the te@@ as@@ er .
V@@ ide@@ o : This Earth is four and a half billion years old .
"These plan@@ ts , se@@ ver@@ al hundre@@ d million years old ."
And we hum@@ ans have been wal@@ king up@@ right for only 2@@ 00 thous@@ and years .
"We &apos;ve man@@ aged to ad@@ ap@@ t , and have con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed the whole planet ."
"For gener@@ ations , we &apos;ve been ra@@ is@@ ing our children , not un@@ like mi@@ llions of other species living be@@ side us ."
F@@ or the past 30 years I &apos;ve been clo@@ se@@ ly wat@@ ching the ear@@ th and its dw@@ el@@ l@@ ers from high up in the sk@@ y .

"F@@ i@@ sh@@ ing , bre@@ e@@ ding , far@@ ming are still the world &apos;s fore@@ most human oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ations ."

And yet we car@@ ry on ra@@ is@@ ing wal@@ ls to keep us a@@ part .

In less than 50 years we &apos;ve alter@@ ed it more th@@ o@@ rou@@ gh@@ ly than in the entire history of man@@ kind .

We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet under@@ sto@@ od that we &apos;re going at a much f@@ ast@@ er p@@ ace than the planet can susta@@ in .
We know that solu@@ tions are available today .
We all have the power to change this tr@@ end for the better .
So what are we wai@@ ting for ?
( Applause ) Y@@ A@@ B : Lu@@ c B@@ es@@ son is the produ@@ cer of the movie .
But it is not a nor@@ mal movie .
The film is going to be di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted f@@ ree .
This film has no cop@@ y@@ right .
"O@@ n the five of Ju@@ ne , the environment day , everybody can dow@@ n@@ lo@@ ad the movie on Inter@@ net ."
The film is given for f@@ ree to the di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tor for T@@ V and the@@ ater to show it the fi@@ f@@ th of Ju@@ ne .
There is no business on this movie .
"It is also available for school , cities , N@@ G@@ O@@ s and you ."
We have to believe what we know .
Let me tell you something .
It &apos;s too l@@ ate to be p@@ es@@ si@@ mi@@ stic — really too l@@ ate .
We have all a part of the solu@@ tions .
"To fin@@ is@@ h , I would like to wel@@ come the 4@@ ,@@ 7@@ 0@@ 0@@ th b@@ aby born since the beginning of this talk ."
M@@ er@@ ci beau@@ cou@@ p . I love you .
( Applause )
"I &apos;ve spent the last dec@@ ade sub@@ je@@ cting myself to pa@@ in and hu@@ mili@@ ation , hop@@ e@@ fully for a good cause , which is self-@@ impro@@ v@@ ement ."
And I &apos;ve done this in three par@@ ts .
So first I started with the mind .
"And I decided to try to get s@@ mar@@ ter by re@@ ading the entire En@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ a Bri@@ tan@@ ni@@ ca from A to Z — or , more pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly , from &quot; &quot; a@@ -@@ ak &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; Z@@ y@@ wie@@ c . &quot; &quot; And here &apos;s a little image of that ."
And this was an amazing year .
It was really a fas@@ cin@@ ating jour@@ ney .
"It was pain@@ ful at times , es@@ pe@@ cially for those around me ."
My wi@@ fe started to f@@ ine me one dol@@ lar for every ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant fact I in@@ ser@@ ted into convers@@ ation .
So it had its dow@@ n@@ si@@ des .
"But after that , I decided to work on the sp@@ ir@@ it ."
"As I men@@ tion@@ ed last year , I gre@@ w up with no religi@@ on at all ."
"I &apos;m Je@@ wi@@ sh , but I &apos;m Je@@ wi@@ sh in the same way the O@@ live G@@ ar@@ den is I@@ t@@ ali@@ an ."
( Laughter ) N@@ ot really .
But I decided to learn about the Bi@@ ble and my h@@ eri@@ t@@ age by actually di@@ ving in and trying to live it and im@@ mer@@ se myself in it .
So I decided to fol@@ low all the ru@@ les of the Bi@@ ble .
And from the Ten C@@ om@@ m@@ and@@ ments to grow@@ ing my be@@ ard — because Le@@ vi@@ ti@@ cus says you cannot s@@ have .
So this is what I looked like by the end .
Thank you for that re@@ action .
"( Laughter ) I look a little like M@@ os@@ es , or T@@ ed K@@ a@@ czyn@@ ski ."
I got both of them .
So there was the top@@ i@@ ary there .
And there &apos;s the sh@@ e@@ ep .
"Now the fin@@ al part of the tri@@ logy was I wanted to fo@@ cus on the body and try to be the health@@ ie@@ st person I could be , the health@@ ie@@ st person ali@@ ve ."
So that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing the last couple of years .
And I just fini@@ shed a couple of months ago .
"And I have to say , th@@ ank God ."
Because living so heal@@ thi@@ ly was kil@@ ling me .
"( Laughter ) It was so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming , because the amount of things you have to do , it &apos;s just min@@ d-@@ bog@@ gl@@ ing ."
I was list@@ ening to all the exper@@ ts and talking to sort of a bo@@ ard of medi@@ cal ad@@ vi@@ s@@ ers .
And they were tel@@ ling me all the things I had to do .
"I had to e@@ at right , ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se , medi@@ t@@ ate , pe@@ t do@@ gs , because that low@@ ers the blo@@ od pres@@ sure ."
"I wro@@ te the book on a tre@@ ad@@ mi@@ ll , and it took me about a thous@@ and miles to write the book ."
I had to put on su@@ n@@ scre@@ en .
"This was no small fe@@ at , because if you list@@ en to der@@ mat@@ ologi@@ sts , they say that you should have a sh@@ ot gl@@ as@@ s full of su@@ n@@ scre@@ en ."
And you have to re@@ app@@ ly it every two to four hours .
So I think half of my book adv@@ ance went into su@@ n@@ scre@@ en .
I was like a g@@ la@@ zed d@@ ou@@ gh@@ nu@@ t for most of the year .
There was the wa@@ sh@@ ing of h@@ ands .
I had to do that pro@@ per@@ ly .
"And my im@@ mu@@ no@@ logi@@ st told me that I should also wi@@ pe down all of the re@@ mot@@ e contro@@ ls and i@@ P@@ h@@ ones in my house , because those are just or@@ g@@ ies of ger@@ ms ."
So that took a lot of time .
"I also tr@@ ied to be the sa@@ f@@ est person I could be , because that &apos;s a part of health ."
I was inspi@@ red by the D@@ ani@@ sh S@@ a@@ fe@@ ty C@@ oun@@ ci@@ l .
"They started a public cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n that says , &quot; &quot; A wal@@ king hel@@ met is a good hel@@ met . &quot; &quot; So they believe you should not just we@@ ar hel@@ me@@ ts for bi@@ king , but also for wal@@ king around ."
And you can see there they &apos;re sh@@ op@@ ping with their hel@@ me@@ ts .
"( Laughter ) Well ye@@ ah , I tr@@ ied that ."
"Now it &apos;s a little extre@@ me , I ad@@ m@@ it ."
"But if you think about this , this is actually — the &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ ak@@ on@@ omi@@ cs &quot; &quot; au@@ th@@ ors wro@@ te about this — that more people die on a per mi@@ le basi@@ s from dru@@ n@@ k wal@@ king than from dru@@ n@@ k dri@@ ving ."
So something to think about ton@@ ight if you &apos;ve had a couple .
"So I fini@@ shed , and it was a suc@@ cess in a sense ."
All of the mark@@ ers went in the right dire@@ ction .
"My cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol went down , I lost we@@ ight , my wi@@ fe stop@@ ped tel@@ ling me that I looked pre@@ gn@@ ant ."
So that was nice .
And it was suc@@ cess@@ ful over@@ all .
"But I also learned that I was too health@@ y , and that was un@@ health@@ y ."
I was so fo@@ c@@ used on doing all these things that I was neg@@ le@@ cting my friends and family .
"And as D@@ an Bu@@ et@@ t@@ ner can tell you , having a stron@@ g social network is so c@@ ru@@ cial to our health ."
So I fini@@ shed .
And I kind of went over@@ bo@@ ard on the week after the project was over .
"I went to the dar@@ k side , and I just indu@@ l@@ g@@ ed myself ."
It was like something out of C@@ ali@@ gu@@ la .
( Laughter ) Wi@@ th@@ out the se@@ x part .
"Because I have three young kids , so that wasn &apos;t happening ."
"But the over@@ -@@ e@@ ating and over@@ -@@ d@@ r@@ in@@ king , defini@@ tely ."
And I finally have st@@ abi@@ liz@@ ed .
So now I &apos;m back to ad@@ op@@ ting many — not all ; I don &apos;t we@@ ar a hel@@ met any@@ more — but do@@ z@@ ens of health@@ y behavi@@ ors that I ad@@ op@@ ted during my year .
It was really a li@@ fe@@ -@@ chang@@ ing project .
"And I , of course , don &apos;t have time to go into all of them ."
Let me just tell you two really quickly .
The first is — and this was sur@@ pri@@ sing to me ; I didn &apos;t expe@@ ct this to come out — but I live a much qu@@ ie@@ ter life now .
Because we live in such a no@@ is@@ y world .
"There &apos;s tra@@ ins and plan@@ es and cars and Bi@@ ll O &apos;@@ Re@@ il@@ ly , he &apos;s very no@@ is@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) And this is a real under@@ est@@ im@@ ated , under@@ -@@ ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated health ha@@ z@@ ard — not just because it har@@ ms our hear@@ ing , which it obvi@@ ously does , but it actually ini@@ ti@@ ates the fi@@ gh@@ t-@@ or@@ -@@ f@@ light respon@@ se ."
A l@@ ou@@ d no@@ ise will get your fi@@ gh@@ t-@@ or@@ -@@ f@@ light respon@@ se going .
"And this , over the years , can cause real dam@@ age , car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cular dam@@ age ."
The World H@@ e@@ alth O@@ r@@ gani@@ z@@ ation just did a big study that they publi@@ shed this year .
And it was done in Europ@@ e .
And they est@@ im@@ ated that 1@@ .@@ 6 million years of health@@ y living are lost every year in Europ@@ e because of no@@ ise pol@@ lu@@ tion .
So they think it &apos;s actually very de@@ ad@@ ly .
"And by the way , it &apos;s also terri@@ ble for your brain ."
It really im@@ pa@@ ir@@ s cogni@@ tion .
And our F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ a@@ thers knew about this .
"When they wro@@ te the Con@@ stitu@@ tion , they put di@@ r@@ t all over the c@@ ob@@ b@@ le@@ st@@ ones outside the h@@ all so that they could con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate ."
"So without no@@ ise redu@@ ction technology , our country would not exi@@ st ."
"So as a pat@@ ri@@ ot , I felt it was important to — I we@@ ar all the ear@@ p@@ lu@@ gs and the ear@@ ph@@ ones , and it &apos;s really impro@@ ved my life in a sur@@ pri@@ sing and u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted way ."
"And the second point I want to make , the fin@@ al point , is that — and it &apos;s actually been a the@@ me of TE@@ D@@ M@@ E@@ D — that jo@@ y is so important to your health , that very few of these behavi@@ ors will sti@@ ck with me un@@ less there &apos;s some sense of ple@@ as@@ ure and jo@@ y in them ."
And just to give you one in@@ stance of this : food .
The j@@ un@@ k food indu@@ stry is really great at pres@@ sing our ple@@ as@@ ure bu@@ t@@ t@@ ons and fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing out what &apos;s the most ple@@ as@@ u@@ ra@@ ble .
But I think we can use their techni@@ qu@@ es and app@@ ly them to health@@ y food .
"To give just one example , we love c@@ ru@@ n@@ ch@@ iness , m@@ ou@@ th@@ feel ."
So I basically have tr@@ ied to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate c@@ ru@@ n@@ ch@@ iness into a lot of my re@@ ci@@ p@@ es — th@@ row in some su@@ n@@ f@@ low@@ er se@@ eds .
And you can almost tri@@ ck yourself into thinking you &apos;re e@@ ating D@@ ori@@ to@@ s .
( Laughter ) And it has made me a health@@ ier person .
So that is it .
The book about it comes out in Ap@@ ri@@ l .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; D@@ ro@@ p De@@ ad H@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ y . &quot; &quot; And I hope that I don &apos;t get si@@ ck during the book t@@ our .
That &apos;s my gre@@ at@@ est hope .
So th@@ ank you very much .
( Applause )
"B@@ il@@ lie Je@@ an K@@ ing : H@@ i , everyone !"
Thank you !
"G@@ e@@ tting me all w@@ ound up , now !"
( Laughter ) P@@ at M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell : Go@@ od !
"You know , when I was wat@@ ching the video again of the mat@@ ch , you must have felt like the f@@ ate of the world &apos;s women was on every stro@@ ke you took ."
W@@ ere you feeling that ?
"B@@ J@@ K : F@@ ir@@ st of all , B@@ ob@@ by R@@ ig@@ gs — he was the form@@ er number one pla@@ y@@ er , he wasn &apos;t just some h@@ ac@@ k@@ er , by the way ."
He was one of my her@@ o@@ es and I ad@@ mi@@ red him .
"And that &apos;s the reason I be@@ at him , actually , because I re@@ spe@@ cted him ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s true — my mo@@ m and es@@ pe@@ cially my d@@ ad always said : &quot; R@@ es@@ pe@@ ct your op@@ pon@@ ent , and never under@@ est@@ im@@ ate them , ever . &quot;"
And he was cor@@ re@@ ct . He was absolu@@ tely cor@@ re@@ ct .
But I knew it was about social change .
"And I was really ner@@ v@@ ous wh@@ en@@ ever we an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced it , and I felt like the whole world was on my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders ."
"And I thought , &quot; &quot; If I lo@@ se , it &apos;s going to put women back 50 years , at least . &quot; &quot; Ti@@ tle I@@ X had just been pas@@ sed the year before — Ju@@ ne 2@@ 3 , 19@@ 7@@ 2 ."
"And women &apos;s prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal ten@@ n@@ is — there were n@@ ine of us who sig@@ ned a one@@ -@@ dol@@ lar con@@ trac@@ t in 19@@ 70 — now remember , the mat@@ ch is in &apos; 7@@ 3 ."
"So we were only in our third year of having a t@@ our where we could actually play , have a place to compe@@ te and make a living ."
So there were n@@ ine of us that sig@@ ned that one@@ -@@ dol@@ lar con@@ trac@@ t .
"And our dre@@ am was for any girl , born any place in the world — if she was good enough — there would be a place for her to compe@@ te and for us to make a living ."
"Because before 19@@ 6@@ 8 , we made 14 dollars a day , and we were under the control of organiz@@ ations ."
So we really wanted to bre@@ ak away from that .
But we knew it wasn &apos;t really about our gener@@ ation so much ; we knew it was about the future gener@@ ations .
"We do stand on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders of the people that came before us , there is no question ."
But every gener@@ ation has the ch@@ ance to make it better .
That was really on my mind .
I really wanted to start mat@@ ching the hear@@ ts and min@@ ds to Ti@@ tle I@@ X .
"T@@ i@@ tle I@@ X , in case any@@ body doesn &apos;t know , which a lot of people probably don &apos;t , said that any fe@@ der@@ al fun@@ ds given to a high school , colle@@ ge or uni@@ versity , either public or pri@@ v@@ ate , had to — finally — give equ@@ al mon@@ ies to bo@@ ys and girls ."
And that changed everything .
"( Applause ) So you can have a la@@ w , but it &apos;s chang@@ ing the hear@@ ts and min@@ ds to mat@@ ch up with it ."
"That &apos;s when it really ro@@ cks , tot@@ ally ."
So that was on my mind .
I wanted to start that change in the hear@@ ts and min@@ ds .
But two things came out of that mat@@ ch .
"For women : self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dence , em@@ power@@ ment ."
They actually had enough ner@@ ve to ask for a ra@@ ise .
"S@@ ome women have wai@@ ted 10 , 15 years to ask ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ore import@@ an@@ tly , did you get it ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they did !"
And for the men ?
"A lot of the men today don &apos;t realize it , but if you &apos;re in your 5@@ 0s , 6@@ 0s or whatever , l@@ ate 4@@ 0s , you &apos;re the first gener@@ ation of men of the W@@ om@@ en &apos;s Mo@@ v@@ ement — whether you like it or not !"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And for the men , what happened for the men , they &apos;d come up to me — and most times , the men are the ones who have te@@ ars in their eyes , it &apos;s very interesting ."
"They go , &quot; &quot; B@@ il@@ lie , I was very young when I saw that mat@@ ch , and now I have a d@@ aughter ."
"And I am so happy I saw that as a young man . &quot; &quot; And one of those young men , at 12 years old , was P@@ resi@@ dent O@@ b@@ ama ."
"And he actually told me that when I met him , he said : &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t realize it , but I saw that mat@@ ch at 12 ."
"And now I have two d@@ augh@@ ters , and it has made a difference in how I ra@@ ise them . &quot; &quot; So both men and women got a lot out of it , but different things ."
P@@ M : And now there are gener@@ ations — at least one or two — who have exper@@ ien@@ ced the equ@@ ality that Ti@@ tle I@@ X and other fi@@ ghts along the way made possible .
"And for women , there are gener@@ ations who have also exper@@ ien@@ ced te@@ am@@ work ."
They got to play team spor@@ ts in a way they ha@@ dn &apos;t before .
"So you had a leg@@ acy already built in terms of being an a@@ th@@ le@@ te , a leg@@ acy of the work you did to lob@@ by for equ@@ al pay for women a@@ th@@ le@@ tes and the W@@ om@@ en &apos;s S@@ por@@ ts F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
What now are you looking to ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh with The B@@ il@@ lie Je@@ an K@@ ing Le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative ?
B@@ J@@ K : I think it goes back to an epi@@ ph@@ any I had at 12 .
"A@@ t 11 , I wanted to be the number one ten@@ n@@ is pla@@ y@@ er in the world , and a friend had asked me to play and I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; T@@ en@@ n@@ is was not in my family — bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball was , other spor@@ ts ."
"F@@ ast forward to 12 years old , ( Laughter ) and I &apos;m finally star@@ ting to play in t@@ our@@ na@@ ments where you get a ran@@ king at the end of the year ."
"So I was da@@ y@@ dre@@ am@@ ing at the L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les T@@ en@@ n@@ is C@@ lub , and I started thinking about my spor@@ t and how t@@ iny it was , but also that everybody who pla@@ yed wor@@ e white sho@@ es , white clo@@ the@@ s , pla@@ yed with white bal@@ ls — everybody who pla@@ yed was white ."
"And I said to myself , at 12 years old , &quot; &quot; W@@ here is everyone else ? &quot; &quot; And that just ke@@ pt sti@@ c@@ king in my brain ."
"And that moment , I pro@@ mis@@ ed myself I &apos;d fi@@ ght for equ@@ al ri@@ ghts and opportuni@@ ties for bo@@ ys and girls , men and women , the rest of my life ."
"And that ten@@ n@@ is , if I was for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate enough to become number one — and I knew , being a girl , it would be har@@ der to have in@@ flu@@ ence , already at that age — that I had this pl@@ at@@ form ."
And ten@@ n@@ is is global .
"And I thought , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
I &apos;ve been given an opportunity that very few people have had . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know if I was going to make it — this was only 12 .
"I sure wanted it , but making it is a whole other di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
"I just remember I pro@@ mis@@ ed myself , and I really try to keep my word ."
"That &apos;s who I tru@@ ly am , just fi@@ gh@@ ting for people ."
"And , un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , women have had less ."
And we are consi@@ der@@ ed less .
"And so my at@@ ten@@ tions , where did they have to go ?"
It was just ... you have to .
"And learn to sti@@ ck up for yourself , hear your own vo@@ ice ."
"You hear the same words keep coming out all the time , and I got really lu@@ ck@@ y because I had an education ."
"And I think if you can see it you can be it , you know ?"
"If you can see it , you can be it ."
"You look at P@@ at , you look at other le@@ ad@@ ers , you look at these spe@@ ak@@ ers , look at yourself , because everyone — everyone — can do something ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ."
E@@ very single person .
"P@@ M : And your story , B@@ il@@ lie , has inspi@@ red so many women every@@ where ."
"Now with the B@@ il@@ lie Je@@ an K@@ ing Le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative , you &apos;re taking on an even bi@@ g@@ ger cause ."
"Because one thing we hear a lot about is women taking their vo@@ ice , working to find their way into le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship posi@@ tions ."
But what you &apos;re talking about is even bi@@ g@@ ger than that .
It &apos;s inclu@@ sive le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship .
And this is a gener@@ ation that has grow@@ n up thinking more inclu@@ si@@ vely — B@@ J@@ K : I@@ sn &apos;t it great ? L@@ ook at the technology !
It &apos;s amazing how it conne@@ cts us all ! It &apos;s about conne@@ ction .
It &apos;s simply amazing what &apos;s possible because of it .
"But the B@@ il@@ lie Je@@ an K@@ ing Le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative is really about the wor@@ k@@ force mo@@ st@@ ly , and trying to change it , so people can actually go to work and be their au@@ th@@ enti@@ c selves ."
"Because most of us have two j@@ ob@@ s : One , to f@@ it in — I &apos;ll give you a perfe@@ ct example ."
"A@@ n Afri@@ can American woman gets up an hour ear@@ lie@@ r to go to work , stra@@ igh@@ ten@@ s her ha@@ ir in the ba@@ th@@ room , goes to the ba@@ th@@ room probably four , five , six times a day to keep stra@@ igh@@ ten@@ ing her ha@@ ir , to keep making sure she fi@@ ts in ."
So she &apos;s working two j@@ ob@@ s .
"S@@ he &apos;s got this other job , whatever that may be , but she &apos;s also trying to f@@ it in ."
"O@@ r this po@@ or man who ke@@ pt his di@@ pl@@ om@@ a — he went to Uni@@ versity of Mi@@ chi@@ g@@ an , but he never would talk about his po@@ ver@@ ty as a youn@@ g@@ ster , ever — just would not men@@ tion it ."
So he made sure they saw he was wel@@ l-@@ edu@@ c@@ ated .
"And then you see a g@@ ay guy who has an N@@ F@@ L — which means American fo@@ ot@@ ball for all of you out there , it &apos;s a big deal , it &apos;s very mach@@ o — and he tal@@ ked about fo@@ ot@@ ball all the time , because he was g@@ ay and he didn &apos;t want any@@ body to know ."
It just goes on and on .
"So my wi@@ sh for everyone is to be able to be their au@@ th@@ enti@@ c self 2@@ 4 / 7 , that would be the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate ."
"And we cat@@ ch ourselves — I mean , I cat@@ ch myself to this day ."
"E@@ ven being g@@ ay I cat@@ ch myself , you know , like , ( G@@ as@@ p ) a little un@@ comfor@@ table , a little sur@@ ge in my gu@@ t , feeling not tot@@ ally comfor@@ table in my own sk@@ in ."
"So , I think you have to ask yourself — I want people to be themselves , whatever that is , just let it be ."
"P@@ M : And the first research the Le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative did show@@ ed that , that these exam@@ ples you just used — that many of us have the problem of being au@@ th@@ enti@@ c ."
"But what you &apos;ve just looked at is this mi@@ l@@ len@@ ni@@ al gener@@ ation , who have b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ted from all these equ@@ al opportuni@@ ties — which may not be equ@@ al but exi@@ st every@@ where — B@@ J@@ K : F@@ ir@@ st of all , I &apos;m really lu@@ ck@@ y ."
"P@@ ar@@ t@@ ner@@ ship with T@@ ene@@ o , a strate@@ gi@@ c company that &apos;s amazing ."
That &apos;s really the reason I &apos;m able to do this .
I &apos;ve had two times in my life where I &apos;ve actually had men really behind me with power .
"And that was in the old days with P@@ hi@@ li@@ p M@@ or@@ ris with V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia S@@ li@@ ms , and this is the second time in my entire life ."
And then De@@ lo@@ it@@ te .
The one thing I wanted was data — fac@@ ts .
"So De@@ lo@@ it@@ te s@@ ent out a sur@@ v@@ ey , and over 4@@ ,000 people now have ans@@ wer@@ ed , and we &apos;re contin@@ u@@ ing in the wor@@ k@@ place ."
And what do the mi@@ l@@ len@@ ni@@ als feel ?
"Well , they feel a lot , but what they &apos;re so fanta@@ stic about is — you know , our gener@@ ation was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , we &apos;re going to get re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation . &quot; &quot; So if you walk into a room , you see everybody re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted ."
"That &apos;s not good enough any@@ more , which is so good !"
"So the mi@@ l@@ len@@ ni@@ als are fanta@@ stic ; they want conne@@ ction , eng@@ ag@@ ement ."
"They just want you to tell us what you &apos;re feeling , what you &apos;re thinking , and get into the solution ."
"They &apos;re proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ver@@ s , and of course , you &apos;ve got the information at your fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps , com@@ par@@ ed to when I was grow@@ ing up ."
P@@ M : What did the research show you about mi@@ l@@ len@@ ni@@ als ?
A@@ re they going to make a difference ?
A@@ re they going to create a world where there is really an inclu@@ sive work force ?
"B@@ J@@ K : Well , in 20@@ 25 , 7@@ 5 percent of the global wor@@ k@@ force is going to be mi@@ l@@ len@@ ni@@ als ."
I think they are going to help sol@@ ve problems .
I think they have the wh@@ er@@ e@@ with@@ al to do it .
I know they care a lot .
They have big ideas and they can make big things happen .
"I want to st@@ ay in the now with the young people , I don &apos;t want to get behind ."
( Laughter ) P@@ M : I don &apos;t think there &apos;s any ch@@ ance !
But what you found out in the research about mi@@ l@@ len@@ ni@@ als is not really the experience that a lot of people have with mi@@ l@@ len@@ ni@@ als .
"B@@ J@@ K : No , well , if we want to talk — OK , I &apos;ve been doing my little min@@ i@@ -@@ sur@@ v@@ ey ."
"I &apos;ve been talking to the Bo@@ om@@ ers , who are their b@@ os@@ ses , and I go , &quot; What do you think about the mi@@ l@@ len@@ ni@@ als ? &quot;"
"And I &apos;m pretty exci@@ ted , like it &apos;s good , and they get this face — ( Laughter ) &quot; Oh , you mean the &apos; M@@ e &apos; gener@@ ation ? &quot; ( Laughter )"
"I say , &quot; &quot; Do you really think so ?"
"Because I do think they care about the environment and all these things . &quot; &quot; And they go , &quot; &quot; Oh , B@@ il@@ lie , they cannot fo@@ cus . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They actually have pro@@ ven that the a@@ ver@@ age fo@@ cus for an 1@@ 8@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old is 3@@ 7 secon@@ ds . ( Laughter )"
They can &apos;t fo@@ cus .
And they don &apos;t really care .
I just heard a story the other night : a woman ow@@ ns a gal@@ l@@ ery and she has these wor@@ k@@ ers .
"S@@ he gets a te@@ xt from one of the wor@@ k@@ ers , like an inter@@ n , she &apos;s just star@@ ting — she goes , &quot; Oh , by the way , I &apos;m going to be l@@ ate because I &apos;m at the ha@@ ir@@ dre@@ s@@ s@@ er &apos;s . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) So she ar@@ ri@@ ves , and this b@@ os@@ s says , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;"
"And she says , &quot; &quot; Oh , I was l@@ ate , sor@@ ry , how &apos;s it going ? &quot; &quot; She says , &quot; &quot; Well , gu@@ ess what ? I &apos;d like you leave , you &apos;re fini@@ shed . &quot; &quot; She goes , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) No problem !"
"P@@ M : Now B@@ il@@ lie , that story — I know , but that &apos;s what sc@@ ar@@ es the bo@@ om@@ ers — I &apos;m just tel@@ ling you — so I think it &apos;s good for us to share ."
"( Laughter ) No , it is good for us to share , because we &apos;re our au@@ th@@ enti@@ c selves and what we &apos;re really feeling , so we &apos;ve got to take it both ways , you know ?"
But I have great fai@@ th because — if you &apos;ve been in spor@@ ts like I have — every gener@@ ation gets better .
It &apos;s a fact .
"Wi@@ th the W@@ om@@ en &apos;s S@@ por@@ ts F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation being the adv@@ oc@@ ates for Ti@@ tle I@@ X still , because we &apos;re trying to keep prote@@ cting the la@@ w , because it &apos;s in a ten@@ u@@ ous posi@@ tion always , so we really are con@@ cer@@ ned , and we do a lot of research ."
That &apos;s very important to us .
And I want to hear from people .
But we really have to prote@@ ct what Ti@@ tle I@@ X stan@@ ds for wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de .
And you heard P@@ resi@@ dent C@@ ar@@ ter talk about how Ti@@ tle I@@ X is prote@@ cted .
"And do you know that every single l@@ aw@@ su@@ it that girls , at least in spor@@ ts , have gone up against — whatever institu@@ tions — has won ?"
Ti@@ tle I@@ X is there to prote@@ ct us .
And it is amazing .
But we still have to get the hear@@ ts and min@@ ds — the hear@@ ts and min@@ ds to mat@@ ch the le@@ gi@@ sl@@ ation is huge .
P@@ M : So what gets you up every morning ?
"What ke@@ e@@ ps you susta@@ ining your work , susta@@ ining the fi@@ ght for equ@@ ality , ex@@ ten@@ ding it , always expl@@ or@@ ing new are@@ as , trying to find new ways ... ?"
"B@@ J@@ K : Well , I always dro@@ ve my parents c@@ razy because I was always the cu@@ ri@@ ous one ."
I &apos;m high@@ ly moti@@ v@@ ated .
My youn@@ ger bro@@ ther was a M@@ aj@@ or Le@@ ag@@ ue B@@ as@@ e@@ ball pla@@ y@@ er .
My po@@ or parents did not care if we were any good .
"( Laughter ) And we dro@@ ve them c@@ razy because we p@@ us@@ h@@ ed , we p@@ us@@ h@@ ed because we wanted to be the best ."
And I think it &apos;s because of what I &apos;m hear@@ ing today in TED tal@@ ks .
"I think to list@@ en to these different women , to list@@ en to different people , to list@@ en to P@@ resi@@ dent C@@ ar@@ ter — 90 years old , by the way , and he we was th@@ row@@ ing these figu@@ res out that I would never — I &apos;d have to go , &quot; E@@ x@@ c@@ use me , wa@@ it a minu@@ te , I need to get a li@@ st out of these figu@@ res . &quot;"
"He was rat@@ t@@ ling off — I mean , that &apos;s amazing , I &apos;m sor@@ ry ."
P@@ M : He &apos;s an amazing man .
"( Applause ) B@@ J@@ K : And then you &apos;re going to have P@@ resi@@ dent M@@ ary Rob@@ in@@ son , who &apos;s a form@@ er pre@@ si@@ dent — Thank you , I@@ ri@@ sh ! 6@@ 2 percent ! L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q ! Yes ! ( Applause )"
"C@@ on@@ gre@@ ss is v@@ ot@@ ing in Ju@@ ne on sam@@ e-@@ se@@ x mar@@ ri@@ age , so these are things that for some people are very hard to hear ."
"But always remember , every one of us is an individu@@ al , a human being with a be@@ ating heart , who car@@ es and wan@@ ts to live their au@@ th@@ enti@@ c life ."
"O@@ K ? You don &apos;t have to ag@@ ree with somebody , but everyone has the opportunity ."
"I think we all have an ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation to contin@@ ue to keep moving the need@@ le forward , always ."

Th@@ an@@ ks a lot !
Thank you so much . I &apos;m going to try to take you on a jour@@ ney of the under@@ water ac@@ ou@@ stic world of wh@@ al@@ es and dol@@ ph@@ ins .
"S@@ in@@ ce we are such a vi@@ su@@ al species , it &apos;s hard for us to really understand this , so I &apos;ll use a mi@@ x@@ ture of figu@@ res and sounds and hope this can communi@@ cate it ."
"But let &apos;s also think , as a vi@@ su@@ al species , what it &apos;s like when we go s@@ nor@@ k@@ el@@ ing or di@@ ving and try to look under@@ water ."
We really can &apos;t see very far .
"O@@ ur vision , which works so well in air , all of a sud@@ den is very re@@ stri@@ cted and cl@@ au@@ stro@@ ph@@ ob@@ ic ."
And what mar@@ ine m@@ am@@ m@@ als have ev@@ olved over the last ten@@ s of mi@@ llions of years is ways to de@@ p@@ end on sound to both expl@@ ore their world and also to st@@ ay in tou@@ ch with one another .
D@@ ol@@ ph@@ ins and to@@ o@@ the@@ d wh@@ al@@ es use e@@ cho@@ lo@@ cation .
They can produ@@ ce l@@ ou@@ d c@@ lic@@ ks and list@@ en for e@@ cho@@ es from the se@@ a flo@@ or in order to or@@ ien@@ t .
They can list@@ en for e@@ cho@@ es from pre@@ y in order to deci@@ de where food is and to deci@@ de which one they want to e@@ at .
All mar@@ ine m@@ am@@ m@@ als use sound for communi@@ cation to st@@ ay in tou@@ ch .
"So the large b@@ ale@@ en wh@@ al@@ es will produ@@ ce long , beautiful son@@ gs , which are used in re@@ produ@@ ctive ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se@@ ment for m@@ ale and fe@@ mal@@ es , both to find one another and to se@@ le@@ ct a m@@ ate ."
"And mother and young and clo@@ se@@ ly b@@ on@@ ded animals use cal@@ ls to st@@ ay in tou@@ ch with one another , so sound is really cri@@ tical for their lives ."
"The first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these under@@ water animals , wh@@ ose world was so fore@@ ig@@ n to me , was evi@@ dence from cap@@ tive dol@@ ph@@ ins that cap@@ tive dol@@ ph@@ ins could imi@@ t@@ ate human sounds ."
And I men@@ tion@@ ed I &apos;ll use some vi@@ su@@ al re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ations of sounds .
Here &apos;s the first example .
"This is a p@@ lot of fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy against time — sort of like musi@@ cal not@@ ation , where the high@@ er not@@ es are up high@@ er and the low@@ er not@@ es are low@@ er , and time goes this way ."
"This is a picture of a tra@@ in@@ er &apos;s wh@@ ist@@ le , a wh@@ ist@@ le a tra@@ in@@ er will b@@ low to tell a dol@@ ph@@ in it &apos;s done the right thing and can come get a fish ."
It sounds sort of like &quot; &quot; t@@ wee@@ e@@ e@@ e@@ et . &quot; &quot; Li@@ ke that .
This is a cal@@ f in cap@@ ti@@ vity making an imi@@ tation of that tra@@ in@@ er &apos;s wh@@ ist@@ le .
"If you hum@@ med this tu@@ ne to your do@@ g or c@@ at and it hum@@ med it back to you , you ou@@ ght to be pretty sur@@ pri@@ sed ."
V@@ ery few n@@ on@@ human m@@ am@@ m@@ als can imi@@ t@@ ate sounds .
It &apos;s really important for our music and our language .
"So it &apos;s a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le : The few other m@@ am@@ mal grou@@ ps that do this , why do they do it ?"
"A lot of my car@@ e@@ er has been de@@ v@@ ot@@ ed to trying to understand how these animals use their lear@@ ning , use the ability to change what you say based on what you hear in their own communi@@ cation systems ."
So let &apos;s start with cal@@ ls of a n@@ on@@ human pri@@ m@@ ate .
"M@@ any m@@ am@@ m@@ als have to produ@@ ce cont@@ act cal@@ ls when , say , a mother and cal@@ f are a@@ part ."
This is an example of a call produ@@ ced by squ@@ ir@@ re@@ l mon@@ ke@@ ys when they &apos;re is@@ ol@@ ated from another one .
"And you can see , there &apos;s not much v@@ ari@@ ability in these cal@@ ls ."
"B@@ y con@@ tra@@ st , the sig@@ nature wh@@ ist@@ le which dol@@ ph@@ ins use to st@@ ay in tou@@ ch , each individu@@ al here has a radi@@ cally different call ."
They can use this ability to learn cal@@ ls in order to develo@@ p more comp@@ lic@@ ated and more di@@ st@@ in@@ ctive cal@@ ls to iden@@ ti@@ fy individu@@ als .
How about the se@@ tting in which animals need to use this call ?
Well let &apos;s look at mo@@ thers and cal@@ ves .
"In nor@@ mal life for mother and cal@@ f dol@@ ph@@ in , they &apos;ll often dri@@ ft a@@ part or s@@ wi@@ m a@@ part if M@@ om is ch@@ as@@ ing a fish , and when they se@@ par@@ ate they have to get back together again ."
"What this figure shows is the per@@ cent@@ age of the se@@ par@@ ations in which dol@@ ph@@ ins wh@@ ist@@ le , against the ma@@ x@@ i@@ mu@@ m di@@ stance ."
"So when dol@@ ph@@ ins are se@@ par@@ ating by less than 20 me@@ ters , less than half the time they need to use wh@@ ist@@ les ."
Mo@@ st of the time they can just find each other just by s@@ wi@@ m@@ ming around .
"But all of the time when they se@@ par@@ ate by more than 100 me@@ ters , they need to use these individu@@ ally di@@ st@@ in@@ ctive wh@@ ist@@ les to come back together again ."
Mo@@ st of these di@@ st@@ in@@ ctive sig@@ nature wh@@ ist@@ les are quite ster@@ e@@ oty@@ ped and st@@ able through the life of a dol@@ ph@@ in .
But there are some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"When a m@@ ale dol@@ ph@@ in lea@@ ves M@@ om , it will often jo@@ in up with another m@@ ale and form an al@@ li@@ ance , which may last for de@@ ca@@ des ."
"As these two animals form a social b@@ ond , their di@@ st@@ in@@ ctive wh@@ ist@@ les actually con@@ ver@@ ge and become very si@@ mi@@ lar ."
This p@@ lot shows two mem@@ bers of a pa@@ ir .
"As you can see at the top here , they share an up@@ -@@ s@@ we@@ ep , like &quot; &quot; wo@@ o@@ p , wo@@ o@@ p , wo@@ o@@ p . &quot; &quot; They both have that kind of up@@ -@@ s@@ we@@ ep ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as these mem@@ bers of a pa@@ ir go &quot; &quot; wo@@ -@@ ot , wo@@ -@@ ot , wo@@ -@@ ot . &quot; &quot; And what &apos;s happened is they &apos;ve used this lear@@ ning process to develo@@ p a new sig@@ n that iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ies this new social group ."
It &apos;s a very interesting way that they can form a new iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ier for the new social group that they &apos;ve had .
Let &apos;s now take a ste@@ p back and see what this mess@@ age can tell us about prote@@ cting dol@@ ph@@ ins from human di@@ st@@ urb@@ ance .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ body looking at this picture will know this dol@@ ph@@ in is sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded , and c@@ lear@@ ly his behavi@@ or is being dis@@ ru@@ p@@ ted ."
This is a bad situ@@ ation .
"But it turns out that when just a single boat is appro@@ ach@@ ing a group of dol@@ ph@@ ins at a couple hundre@@ d me@@ ters away , the dol@@ ph@@ ins will start wh@@ ist@@ ling , they &apos;ll change what they &apos;re doing , they &apos;ll have a more co@@ he@@ sive group , wa@@ it for the boat to go by , and then they &apos;ll get back to nor@@ mal business ."
"Well , in a place like S@@ ar@@ as@@ ot@@ a , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , the a@@ ver@@ age inter@@ v@@ al between times that a boat is pas@@ sing within a hundre@@ d me@@ ters of a dol@@ ph@@ in group is six minutes ."
"So even in the situ@@ ation that doesn &apos;t look as bad as this , it &apos;s still af@@ fe@@ cting the amount of time these animals have to do their nor@@ mal work ."
"And if we look at a very pri@@ st@@ ine environment like we@@ ster@@ n Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , L@@ ars Bi@@ der has done work com@@ par@@ ing dol@@ ph@@ in behavi@@ or and di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion before there were dol@@ ph@@ in@@ -@@ wat@@ ching bo@@ ats ."
"When there was one boat , not much of an impac@@ t ."
"And two bo@@ ats : When the second boat was ad@@ ded , what happened was that some of the dol@@ ph@@ ins left the area completely ."
"O@@ f the ones that sta@@ yed , their re@@ produ@@ ctive r@@ ate dec@@ lin@@ ed ."
So it could have a neg@@ ative impac@@ t on the whole popul@@ ation .
"When we think of mar@@ in@@ e-@@ prote@@ cted are@@ as for animals like dol@@ ph@@ ins , this means that we have to be quite con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous about acti@@ vi@@ ties that we thought were b@@ eni@@ g@@ n ."
We may need to regu@@ l@@ ate the inten@@ sity of re@@ cre@@ ational bo@@ ating and ac@@ tu@@ al wh@@ ale wat@@ ching in order to pre@@ v@@ ent these kinds of problems .
I &apos;d also like to point out that sound doesn &apos;t obe@@ y b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies .
"So you can dra@@ w a line to try to prote@@ ct an area , but chemi@@ cal pol@@ lu@@ tion and no@@ ise pol@@ lu@@ tion will contin@@ ue to move through the area ."
"And I &apos;d like to s@@ wit@@ ch now from this local , fami@@ li@@ ar , co@@ ast@@ al environment to a much bro@@ a@@ der world of the b@@ ale@@ en wh@@ al@@ es and the open ocean ."
This is a kind of ma@@ p we &apos;ve all been looking at .
The world is mo@@ st@@ ly blue .
But I &apos;d also like to point out that the oce@@ ans are much more conne@@ cted than we think .
N@@ oti@@ ce how few bar@@ r@@ ier@@ s there are to movement across all of the oce@@ ans com@@ par@@ ed to land .
"To me , the most min@@ d-@@ b@@ ending example of the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ te@@ d@@ ness of the ocean comes from an ac@@ ou@@ stic experim@@ ent where oce@@ an@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ers took a ship to the s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Indi@@ an O@@ ce@@ an , de@@ plo@@ yed an under@@ water l@@ ou@@ d@@ spe@@ ak@@ er and pla@@ yed back a sound ."
"That same sound tra@@ ve@@ led to the w@@ est , and could be heard in B@@ er@@ mu@@ da , and tra@@ ve@@ led to the e@@ ast , and could be heard in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey — the same sound ."
"So we live in a world of s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te communi@@ cation , are used to global communi@@ cation , but it &apos;s still amazing to me ."
The ocean has pro@@ per@@ ties that al@@ low low@@ -@@ fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy sound to basically move glob@@ ally .
The ac@@ ou@@ stic tran@@ si@@ t time for each of these pa@@ ths is about three hours .
It &apos;s ne@@ ar@@ ly hal@@ f@@ way around the g@@ lo@@ be .
"In the early &apos; 7@@ 0s , R@@ og@@ er P@@ a@@ y@@ ne and an ocean ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ ci@@ an publi@@ shed a the@@ ore@@ tical pa@@ per poin@@ ting out that it was possible that sound could trans@@ m@@ it over these large are@@ as , but very few biologi@@ sts belie@@ ved it ."
"It actually turns out , though , even though we &apos;ve only known of lon@@ g@@ -@@ r@@ ange pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ation for a few de@@ ca@@ des , the wh@@ al@@ es c@@ lear@@ ly have ev@@ olved , over ten@@ s of mi@@ llions of years , a way to ex@@ plo@@ it this amazing pro@@ per@@ ty of the ocean ."
So blue wh@@ al@@ es and f@@ in wh@@ al@@ es produ@@ ce very low@@ -@@ fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy sounds that can tra@@ vel over very long r@@ ang@@ es .
The top p@@ lot here shows a comp@@ lic@@ ated ser@@ ies of cal@@ ls that are re@@ pe@@ ated by mal@@ es .
"They form son@@ gs , and they ap@@ pe@@ ar to play a ro@@ le in re@@ produ@@ ction , sort of like that of s@@ ong bir@@ ds ."
"D@@ own be@@ low here , we see cal@@ ls made by both mal@@ es and fe@@ mal@@ es that also car@@ ry over very long r@@ ang@@ es ."
"The biologi@@ sts contin@@ u@@ ed to be sk@@ e@@ p@@ tical of the lon@@ g@@ -@@ r@@ ange communi@@ cation issue well past the &apos; 7@@ 0s , until the end of the C@@ old W@@ ar ."
"What happened was , during the C@@ old W@@ ar , the U.@@ S. Na@@ v@@ y had a system that was se@@ cre@@ t at the time , that they used to tr@@ ack R@@ us@@ si@@ an sub@@ mar@@ ines ."
"It had de@@ ep under@@ water micro@@ ph@@ ones , or hy@@ dro@@ ph@@ ones , c@@ ab@@ led to sh@@ ore , all wi@@ red back to a cent@@ ral place that could list@@ en to sounds over the whole Nor@@ th At@@ lan@@ tic ."
"And after the B@@ er@@ li@@ n W@@ all fe@@ ll , the Na@@ v@@ y made these systems available to wh@@ ale bio@@ -@@ ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans to see what they could hear ."
"This is a p@@ lot from Ch@@ ri@@ stop@@ her C@@ lar@@ k who trac@@ ked one individu@@ al blue wh@@ ale as it pas@@ sed by B@@ er@@ mu@@ da , went down to the l@@ ati@@ tu@@ de of Mi@@ ami and came back again ."
"It was trac@@ ked for 4@@ 3 days , s@@ wi@@ m@@ ming 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 kilome@@ ters , or more than 1@@ ,000 miles ."
This shows us both that the cal@@ ls are de@@ te@@ ct@@ able over hundre@@ ds of miles and that wh@@ al@@ es rou@@ t@@ in@@ ely s@@ wi@@ m hundre@@ ds of miles .
They &apos;re oce@@ an@@ -@@ based and scale animals who are communi@@ c@@ ating over much longer r@@ ang@@ es than we had anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed .
"U@@ n@@ like fin@@ s and blu@@ es , which disp@@ er@@ se into the temper@@ ate and tro@@ pi@@ cal oce@@ ans , the hum@@ p@@ bac@@ ked wh@@ al@@ es con@@ gre@@ g@@ ate in local tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal bre@@ e@@ ding gro@@ un@@ ds , so they can make a sound that &apos;s a little high@@ er in fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy , bro@@ ad@@ er@@ -@@ b@@ and and more comp@@ lic@@ ated ."
So you &apos;re list@@ ening to the comp@@ lic@@ ated s@@ ong produ@@ ced by hum@@ p@@ bac@@ ks here .
"H@@ um@@ p@@ bac@@ ks , when they develo@@ p the ability to sing this s@@ ong , they &apos;re list@@ ening to other wh@@ al@@ es and mo@@ dif@@ ying what they sing based on what they &apos;re hear@@ ing , just like s@@ ong bir@@ ds or the dol@@ ph@@ in wh@@ ist@@ les I descri@@ bed ."
"This means that hum@@ p@@ back s@@ ong is a form of ani@@ mal culture , just like music for hum@@ ans would be ."
I think one of the most interesting exam@@ ples of this comes from Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a .
Bi@@ ologi@@ sts on the e@@ ast co@@ ast of Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a were recor@@ ding the son@@ gs of hum@@ p@@ bac@@ ks in that area .
And this or@@ ange line here mar@@ ks the ty@@ pi@@ cal son@@ gs of e@@ ast co@@ ast hum@@ p@@ bac@@ ks .
In &apos; 9@@ 5 they all s@@ an@@ g the nor@@ mal s@@ ong .
"But in &apos; 9@@ 6 they heard a few we@@ ird son@@ gs , and it turned out that these str@@ ange son@@ gs were ty@@ pi@@ cal of w@@ est co@@ ast wh@@ al@@ es ."
"The w@@ est co@@ ast cal@@ ls became more and more popul@@ ar , until by 199@@ 8 , n@@ one of the wh@@ al@@ es s@@ an@@ g the e@@ ast co@@ ast s@@ ong ; it was completely gone ."
They just s@@ an@@ g the cool new w@@ est co@@ ast s@@ ong .
"It &apos;s as if some new h@@ it sty@@ le had completely wi@@ ped out the ol@@ d-@@ fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ed sty@@ le before , and with no g@@ ol@@ den ol@@ d@@ ies st@@ ations ."
N@@ ob@@ ody s@@ an@@ g the old ones .
I &apos;d like to br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly just show what the ocean does to these cal@@ ls .
"Now you are list@@ ening to a recor@@ ding made by Ch@@ ris C@@ lar@@ k , 0@@ .@@ 2 miles away from a hum@@ p@@ back ."
You can hear the full fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy r@@ ange . It &apos;s quite l@@ ou@@ d .
You sound very ne@@ ar@@ by .
The next recor@@ ding you &apos;re going to hear was made of the same hum@@ p@@ back s@@ ong 50 miles away .
That &apos;s sh@@ own down here .
You only hear the low fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cies .
You hear the re@@ ver@@ ber@@ ation as the sound tra@@ v@@ els over lon@@ g@@ -@@ r@@ ange in the ocean and is not quite as l@@ ou@@ d .
"Now after I play back these hum@@ p@@ back cal@@ ls , I &apos;ll play blue wh@@ ale cal@@ ls , but they have to be sp@@ ed up because they &apos;re so low in fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy that you wouldn &apos;t be able to hear it o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s a blue wh@@ ale call at 50 miles , which was di@@ st@@ ant for the hum@@ p@@ back ."
"It &apos;s l@@ ou@@ d , clear — you can hear it very c@@ lear@@ ly ."
Here &apos;s the same call recor@@ ded from a hy@@ dro@@ phone 500 miles away .
"There &apos;s a lot of no@@ ise , which is mo@@ st@@ ly other wh@@ al@@ es ."
But you can still hear that fa@@ int call .
Let &apos;s now s@@ wit@@ ch and think about a poten@@ tial for human impac@@ ts .
The most dom@@ in@@ ant sound that hum@@ ans put into the ocean comes from shi@@ pping .
"This is the sound of a ship , and I &apos;m having to talk a little l@@ ou@@ der to talk over it ."
I@@ mag@@ ine that wh@@ ale list@@ ening from 500 miles .
There &apos;s a poten@@ tial problem that maybe this kind of shi@@ pping no@@ ise would pre@@ v@@ ent wh@@ al@@ es from being able to hear each other .
Now this is something that &apos;s been known for quite a while .
This is a figure from a te@@ x@@ t@@ book on under@@ water sound .
And on the y@@ -@@ ax@@ is is the l@@ ou@@ d@@ ness of a@@ ver@@ age am@@ b@@ ien@@ t no@@ ise in the de@@ ep ocean by fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy .
"In the low fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cies , this line indi@@ c@@ ates sound that comes from se@@ is@@ mi@@ c acti@@ vity of the ear@@ th ."
"U@@ p high , these v@@ ari@@ able lin@@ es indi@@ cate incre@@ as@@ ing no@@ ise in this fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy r@@ ange from high@@ er wind and wa@@ ve ."
"But right in the mi@@ ddle here where there &apos;s a s@@ we@@ et spo@@ t , the no@@ ise is dom@@ in@@ ated by human ships ."
"Now think about it . This is an amazing thing : That in this fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy r@@ ange where wh@@ al@@ es communi@@ cate , the ma@@ in source glob@@ ally , on our planet , for the no@@ ise comes from human ships , thousands of human ships , di@@ st@@ ant , far away , just all ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ating ."
The next sli@@ de will show what the impac@@ t this may have on the r@@ ange at which wh@@ al@@ es can communi@@ cate .
So here we have the l@@ ou@@ d@@ ness of a call at the wh@@ ale .
"And as we get far@@ ther away , the sound gets fa@@ in@@ ter and fa@@ in@@ ter ."
"Now in the pre@@ -@@ indu@@ stri@@ al ocean , as we were men@@ tion@@ ing , this wh@@ ale call could be e@@ a@@ si@@ ly de@@ te@@ cted ."
It &apos;s l@@ ou@@ der than no@@ ise at a r@@ ange of a thous@@ and kilome@@ ters .
Let &apos;s now take that ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal incre@@ ase in no@@ ise that we saw comes from shi@@ pping .
"A@@ ll of a sud@@ den , the effe@@ ctive r@@ ange of communi@@ cation goes from a thous@@ and kilome@@ ters to 10 kilome@@ ters ."
"Now if this sig@@ na@@ l is used for mal@@ es and fe@@ mal@@ es to find each other for mat@@ ing and they &apos;re disp@@ er@@ sed , imagine the impac@@ t this could have on the re@@ co@@ very of en@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed popul@@ ations ."
Wh@@ al@@ es also have cont@@ act cal@@ ls like I descri@@ bed for the dol@@ ph@@ ins .
I &apos;ll play the sound of a cont@@ act call used by right wh@@ al@@ es to st@@ ay in tou@@ ch .
"And this is the kind of call that is used by , say , right wh@@ ale mo@@ thers and cal@@ ves as they se@@ par@@ ate to come back again ."
Now imagine — let &apos;s put the ship no@@ ise in the picture .
What &apos;s a mother to do if the ship comes by and her cal@@ f isn &apos;t there ?
I &apos;ll descri@@ be a couple strate@@ g@@ ies .
"One strate@@ gy is if your call &apos;s down here , and the no@@ ise is in this b@@ and , you could shi@@ ft the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy of your call out of the no@@ ise b@@ and and communi@@ cate better ."
S@@ us@@ an Par@@ ks of P@@ en@@ n St@@ ate has actually stud@@ ied this .
She &apos;s looked in the At@@ lan@@ tic . Here &apos;s data from the S@@ outh At@@ lan@@ tic .
Here &apos;s a ty@@ pi@@ cal S@@ outh At@@ lan@@ tic cont@@ act call from the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
L@@ ook what happened by 2@@ 000 to the a@@ ver@@ age call .
"S@@ ame thing in the Nor@@ th At@@ lan@@ tic , in the &apos; 5@@ 0s ver@@ su@@ s 2@@ 000 ."
"O@@ ver the last 50 years , as we &apos;ve put more no@@ ise into the oce@@ ans , these wh@@ al@@ es have had to shi@@ ft ."
It &apos;s as if the whole popul@@ ation had to shi@@ ft from being bas@@ ses to sing@@ ing as a ten@@ or .
"It &apos;s an amazing shi@@ ft , indu@@ ced by hum@@ ans over this large scale , in both time and space ."
"And we now know that wh@@ al@@ es can comp@@ en@@ s@@ ate for no@@ ise by cal@@ ling l@@ ou@@ der , like I did when that ship was playing , by wai@@ ting for sil@@ ence and by shi@@ f@@ ting their call out of the no@@ ise b@@ and ."
"Now there &apos;s probably co@@ sts to cal@@ ling l@@ ou@@ der or shi@@ f@@ ting the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy away from where you want to be , and there &apos;s probably lost opportuni@@ ties ."
"If we also have to wa@@ it for sil@@ ence , they may mi@@ ss a cri@@ tical opportunity to communi@@ cate ."
"So we have to be very con@@ cer@@ ned about when the no@@ ise in ha@@ bi@@ tat@@ s de@@ gra@@ des the ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communi@@ cate , or are not able to per@@ form cri@@ tical fun@@ ctions ."
It &apos;s a really important problem .
"And I &apos;m happy to say that there are se@@ ver@@ al very pro@@ mis@@ ing develo@@ p@@ ments in this area , looking at the impac@@ t of shi@@ pping on wh@@ al@@ es ."
"In terms of the shi@@ pping no@@ ise , the Inter@@ national Mar@@ i@@ time O@@ r@@ gani@@ z@@ ation of the United N@@ ations has form@@ ed a group wh@@ ose job is to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh gu@@ ide@@ lin@@ es for qu@@ ie@@ ting ships , to tell the indu@@ stry how you could qu@@ ie@@ t ships ."
"And they &apos;ve already found that by being more inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent about better pro@@ pe@@ l@@ ler design , you can redu@@ ce that no@@ ise by 90 percent ."
"If you actually in@@ sul@@ ate and is@@ ol@@ ate the mach@@ in@@ ery of the ship from the hu@@ ll , you can redu@@ ce that no@@ ise by 9@@ 9 percent ."
"So at this point , it &apos;s pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly an issue of cost and stan@@ dar@@ ds ."
"If this group can est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh stan@@ dar@@ ds , and if the shi@@ p@@ building indu@@ stry ad@@ op@@ ts them for building new ships , we can now see a gra@@ du@@ al dec@@ line in this poten@@ tial problem ."
"But there &apos;s also another problem from ships that I &apos;m il@@ lu@@ str@@ ating here , and that &apos;s the problem of col@@ li@@ sion ."
This is a wh@@ ale that just squ@@ e@@ ak@@ ed by a ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly moving con@@ tain@@ er ship and av@@ o@@ i@@ ded col@@ li@@ sion .
But col@@ li@@ sion is a seri@@ ous problem .
"E@@ n@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed wh@@ al@@ es are kil@@ led every year by ship col@@ li@@ sion , and it &apos;s very important to try to redu@@ ce this ."
I &apos;ll di@@ sc@@ us@@ s two very pro@@ mis@@ ing appro@@ ach@@ es .
The first case comes from the B@@ ay of F@@ un@@ dy .
These black lin@@ es mar@@ k shi@@ pping lan@@ es in and out of the B@@ ay of F@@ un@@ dy .
The col@@ ori@@ zed area shows the ri@@ sk of col@@ li@@ sion for en@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed right wh@@ al@@ es because of the ships moving in this l@@ ane .
"It turns out that this l@@ ane here goes right through a major fe@@ e@@ ding area of right wh@@ al@@ es in the sum@@ m@@ er time , and it makes an area of a sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant ri@@ sk of col@@ li@@ sion ."
"Well , biologi@@ sts who couldn &apos;t take no for an answer went to the Inter@@ national Mar@@ i@@ time O@@ r@@ gani@@ z@@ ation and pe@@ ti@@ tion@@ ed them to say , &quot; &quot; C@@ an &apos;t you move that l@@ ane ? Th@@ ose are just lin@@ es on the ground ."
"C@@ an &apos;t you move them over to a place where there &apos;s less of a ri@@ sk ? &quot; &quot; And the Inter@@ national Mar@@ i@@ time O@@ r@@ gani@@ z@@ ation respon@@ ded very stron@@ g@@ ly , &quot; These are the new lan@@ es . &quot;"
The shi@@ pping lan@@ es have been mo@@ ved .
"And as you can see , the ri@@ sk of col@@ li@@ sion is much low@@ er ."
"So it &apos;s very pro@@ mis@@ ing , actually ."
We can be very cre@@ ative about thinking of different ways to redu@@ ce these ri@@ sk@@ s .
A@@ no@@ ther action which was just taken in@@ depen@@ d@@ ently by a shi@@ pping company itself was ini@@ ti@@ ated because of con@@ cer@@ ns the shi@@ pping company had about gre@@ en@@ house gas e@@ mis@@ sions with global war@@ ming .
The Ma@@ er@@ sk L@@ ine looked at their compe@@ ti@@ tion and saw that everybody who is in shi@@ pping thin@@ ks time is money .
They rus@@ h as f@@ ast as they can to get to their port .
But then they often wa@@ it there .
What Ma@@ er@@ sk did is they worked ways to s@@ low down .
They could s@@ low down by about 50 percent .
"This redu@@ ced their fu@@ el con@@ sum@@ ption by about 30 percent , which sa@@ ved them money , and at the same time , it had a sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant b@@ en@@ ef@@ it for wh@@ al@@ es ."
"It you s@@ low down , you redu@@ ce the amount of no@@ ise you make and you redu@@ ce the ri@@ sk of col@@ li@@ sion ."
"So to con@@ clu@@ de , I &apos;d just like to point out , you know , the wh@@ al@@ es live in an amazing ac@@ ou@@ stic environment ."
They &apos;ve ev@@ olved over ten@@ s of mi@@ llions of years to take adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of this .
And we need to be very at@@ ten@@ tive and vi@@ gi@@ l@@ ant to thinking about where things that we do may un@@ inten@@ tion@@ ally pre@@ v@@ ent them from being able to ach@@ ie@@ ve their important acti@@ vi@@ ties .
"A@@ t the same time , we need to be really cre@@ ative in thinking of solu@@ tions to be able to help redu@@ ce these problems ."
I hope these exam@@ ples have sh@@ own some of the different dire@@ ctions we can take in ad@@ di@@ tion to prote@@ cted are@@ as to be able to keep the ocean sa@@ fe for wh@@ al@@ es to be able to contin@@ ue to communi@@ cate .
Thank you very much .

I &apos;m a relation@@ ship buil@@ der .
"When you think of a relation@@ ship buil@@ der , don &apos;t you just au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally think &quot; &quot; archite@@ ct ? &quot; &quot; P@@ rob@@ ably not ."
"That &apos;s because most people think archite@@ cts design buil@@ dings and cities , but what we really design are relation@@ ships , because cities are about people ."
They &apos;re places where people come together for all kinds of ex@@ change .
"And be@@ si@@ des , sk@@ y@@ lin@@ es are high@@ ly speci@@ fic urb@@ an ha@@ bi@@ tat@@ s with their own in@@ se@@ cts , plan@@ ts and animals , and even their own we@@ a@@ ther ."
"But today , urb@@ an ha@@ bi@@ tat@@ s are out of bal@@ ance ."
"For me , the fie@@ ld of e@@ co@@ logy has provi@@ ded important in@@ si@@ ght , because e@@ co@@ logi@@ sts don &apos;t just look at individu@@ al species on their own , they look at the relation@@ ships between living things and their environment ."
"They look at how all the di@@ verse par@@ ts of the e@@ co@@ system are inter@@ conne@@ cted , and it &apos;s actually this bal@@ ance , this we@@ b of life , that susta@@ ins life ."
My team and I have been ap@@ pl@@ ying in@@ si@@ ghts from e@@ co@@ logy to archite@@ cture to see how physi@@ cal space can help build stron@@ ger relation@@ ships .
The proje@@ cts I &apos;m going to show you today use the idea of building relation@@ ships as the key dri@@ ver for design .
Here &apos;s an example of what I mean .
"R@@ e@@ cent@@ ly , we were asked to design a cen@@ ter for social ju@@ sti@@ ce le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship called the Ar@@ cus C@@ enter ."
"They asked us for a building that could bre@@ ak down tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal bar@@ r@@ ier@@ s between different grou@@ ps and in doing so , create possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies for me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful convers@@ ations around social ju@@ sti@@ ce ."
The students wanted a place for cul@@ tu@@ ral ex@@ change .
They thought a place for pre@@ par@@ ing food together could do that .
And they wanted to be wel@@ coming to the outside community .
They thought a fi@@ re@@ place could dra@@ w people in and help start convers@@ ations .
"C@@ om@@ muni@@ ty me@@ e@@ ting h@@ ous@@ es are places where there &apos;s very speci@@ fic relation@@ ships between people , like this one in M@@ ali , where the el@@ ders ga@@ ther ."
The low ro@@ of ke@@ e@@ ps everybody se@@ ated and at equ@@ al ey@@ e level .
It &apos;s very e@@ g@@ ali@@ t@@ ari@@ an .
"I mean , you can &apos;t stand up and take over the me@@ e@@ ting ."
You &apos;d actually bu@@ m@@ p your head .
"( Laughter ) In me@@ e@@ ting h@@ ous@@ es , there &apos;s always a cent@@ ral space where you can si@@ t around a cir@@ cle and see each other ."
"So we desig@@ ned a space just like that right in the mi@@ ddle of the Ar@@ cus C@@ enter , and we an@@ cho@@ red it with a fi@@ re@@ place and a k@@ it@@ ch@@ en ."
And now the cent@@ ral space works for big social ga@@ ther@@ ings and a place to me@@ et one@@ -@@ on-@@ one for the very first time .
It &apos;s almost like this thre@@ e-@@ way inter@@ se@@ ction that en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ges bu@@ m@@ ping into people and star@@ ting a convers@@ ation .
Now you can always pas@@ s the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en and see something going on .
You can si@@ t by the fi@@ re@@ place and share stories .
"You can study together in big grou@@ ps or in small ones , because the archite@@ cture se@@ ts up these opportuni@@ ties ."
E@@ ven the con@@ stru@@ ction is about building relation@@ ships .
"It &apos;s made of cor@@ d@@ wood mas@@ on@@ ry , which is using lo@@ gs the way you would use bri@@ cks ."
It &apos;s su@@ per low@@ -@@ te@@ ch and e@@ asy to do and any@@ one can do it — and that &apos;s the entire point .
The act of making is a social acti@@ vity .
"And it &apos;s good for the planet , too : the tre@@ es ab@@ sor@@ bed car@@ b@@ on when they were grow@@ ing up , and they gave off o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en , and now that car@@ b@@ on is tra@@ pped inside the wal@@ ls and it &apos;s not being rele@@ as@@ ed into the atmo@@ sp@@ here ."
So making the wal@@ ls is e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent to taking cars right off the ro@@ ad .
We cho@@ se the building meth@@ od because it conne@@ cts people to each other and to the environment .
But is it working ?
Is it cre@@ ating relation@@ ships and n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing them ?
How can we know ?
"Well , more and more people are coming here , for one , and as a resul@@ t of the fi@@ re@@ side ch@@ ats and a full cal@@ en@@ d@@ ar of progra@@ m@@ ming , people are ap@@ pl@@ ying for the Ar@@ cus F@@ el@@ low@@ ships ."
"In fact , app@@ lic@@ ations have incre@@ as@@ ed ten@@ f@@ old for the Ar@@ cus F@@ el@@ low@@ ship since the building open@@ ed ."
It &apos;s working . It &apos;s br@@ ing@@ ing people together .
So I &apos;ve sh@@ own how archite@@ cture can conne@@ ct people on this kind of h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tal cam@@ pu@@ s scale .
T@@ all buil@@ dings don &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly l@@ end themselves to being social buil@@ dings .
They can se@@ em is@@ ol@@ ating and in@@ ward .
You might only see people in those aw@@ k@@ ward ele@@ v@@ ator ri@@ des .
"But in se@@ ver@@ al major cities , I &apos;ve been desig@@ ning t@@ all buil@@ dings that are based on cre@@ ating relation@@ ships between people ."
This is A@@ qu@@ a .
"It &apos;s a resi@@ den@@ tial high-@@ ri@@ se in Chi@@ ca@@ go a@@ im@@ ed at young urb@@ an prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als and em@@ p@@ ty ne@@ st@@ ers , many of them new to the city ."
"Wi@@ th over 7@@ 00 a@@ part@@ ments , we wanted to see if we could use archite@@ cture to help people get to know their neigh@@ b@@ ors , even when their hom@@ es are organiz@@ ed in the ver@@ tical di@@ men@@ sion ."
So we inv@@ en@@ ted a way to use bal@@ con@@ ies as the new social conne@@ ct@@ ors .
The sha@@ p@@ es of the flo@@ or s@@ lab@@ s v@@ ary sli@@ gh@@ tly and they tran@@ si@@ tion as you go up the tow@@ er .
The resul@@ t of this is that you can actually see people from your bal@@ con@@ y .
The bal@@ con@@ ies are mis@@ regi@@ ster@@ ed .
"You can le@@ an over your bal@@ con@@ y and say , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey ! &quot; &quot; just like you would across the back@@ y@@ ard ."
"To make the bal@@ con@@ ies more comfor@@ table for a longer per@@ i@@ od of time during the year , we stud@@ ied the wind with di@@ gi@@ tal si@@ mul@@ ations , so the effe@@ ct of the bal@@ con@@ y sha@@ p@@ es bre@@ ak@@ s up the wind and con@@ f@@ uses the wind and makes the bal@@ con@@ ies more comfor@@ table and less win@@ dy ."
"Now , just by being able to go outside on your bal@@ con@@ y or on the third flo@@ or ro@@ of ter@@ rac@@ e , you can be conne@@ cted to the out@@ do@@ ors , even when you &apos;re way ab@@ o@@ ve the ground pl@@ ane ."
So the building ac@@ ts to create community within the building and the city at the same time .
It &apos;s working .
And people are star@@ ting to me@@ et each other on the building surface and we &apos;ve heard — ( Laughter ) they &apos;ve even star@@ ting getting together as cou@@ ples .
"But be@@ si@@ des ro@@ man@@ tic relation@@ ships , the building has a posi@@ tive social effe@@ ct on the community , as evi@@ den@@ ced by people star@@ ting grou@@ ps together and star@@ ting big proje@@ cts together , like this organi@@ c community gar@@ den on the building &apos;s ro@@ of ter@@ rac@@ e ."
"So I &apos;ve sh@@ own how t@@ all buil@@ dings can be social conne@@ ct@@ ors , but what about public archite@@ cture ?"
"H@@ ow can we create better social co@@ he@@ sion in public buil@@ dings and ci@@ vi@@ c sp@@ ac@@ es , and why is it important ?"
P@@ u@@ bli@@ c archite@@ cture is just not as suc@@ cess@@ ful if it comes from the top down .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 years ago in Chi@@ ca@@ go , they started to re@@ place old poli@@ ce st@@ ations , and they built this iden@@ tical model all over the city ."
"And even though they had good inten@@ tions of tre@@ ating all neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods equ@@ ally , the communi@@ ties didn &apos;t feel inv@@ est@@ ed in the process or feel a sense of ow@@ ner@@ ship of these buil@@ dings ."
And e@@ qui@@ ty is the key issue here .
"You know , in my fie@@ ld , there &apos;s a de@@ b@@ ate about whether archite@@ cture can even do anything to impro@@ ve social relation@@ ships ."
But I believe that we need archite@@ cture and every to@@ ol in our to@@ ol k@@ it to impro@@ ve these relation@@ ships .
"In the U@@ S , poli@@ cy re@@ form@@ s have been re@@ com@@ men@@ ded in order to re@@ build tr@@ ust ."
But my team and I wonder@@ ed if design and a more inclu@@ sive design process could help ad@@ d something posi@@ tive to this poli@@ cy convers@@ ation .
We asked ourselves simply : C@@ an design help re@@ build tr@@ ust ?
So we re@@ ach@@ ed out to community mem@@ bers and poli@@ ce offi@@ c@@ ers in Nor@@ th L@@ aw@@ n@@ d@@ ale ; it &apos;s a neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od in Chi@@ ca@@ go where the poli@@ ce st@@ ation is per@@ cei@@ ved as a sc@@ ary for@@ tre@@ ss sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by a par@@ king lot .
"So we organiz@@ ed this bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming s@@ es@@ sion with both grou@@ ps parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ing , and we came up with this whole new idea for the poli@@ ce st@@ ation ."
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; P@@ ol@@ is St@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ol@@ is &quot; &quot; is a Gre@@ ek word that means a place with a sense of community .
"It &apos;s based on the idea that if you can incre@@ ase opportuni@@ ties for posi@@ tive social inter@@ ac@@ tions between poli@@ ce and community mem@@ bers , you can re@@ build that relation@@ ship and acti@@ v@@ ate the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od at the same time ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad of the poli@@ ce st@@ ation as a sc@@ ary for@@ tre@@ ss , you get high@@ ly ac@@ tive sp@@ ac@@ es on the public side of the st@@ ation — places that sp@@ ar@@ k convers@@ ation , like a bar@@ ber@@ sho@@ p , a co@@ f@@ fe@@ e sho@@ p or spor@@ ts cour@@ ts as well ."
B@@ ot@@ h cop@@ s and kids said they love spor@@ ts .
"These in@@ si@@ ghts came dire@@ ct@@ ly from the community mem@@ bers and the poli@@ ce offi@@ c@@ ers themselves , and as desig@@ n@@ ers , our ro@@ le was just to conne@@ ct the d@@ ots and su@@ ggest the first ste@@ p ."
"So with the help of the city and the par@@ ks , we were able to ra@@ ise fun@@ ds and design and build a hal@@ f-@@ cour@@ t , right on the poli@@ ce st@@ ation par@@ king lot ."
It &apos;s a start .
But is it re@@ building tr@@ ust ?
"The people in Nor@@ th L@@ aw@@ n@@ d@@ ale say the kids are using the cour@@ ts every day and they even organi@@ ze t@@ our@@ na@@ ments like this one sh@@ own here , and once in a while an offi@@ cer jo@@ ins in ."
And re@@ cent@@ ly they &apos;ve asked us to ex@@ p@@ and the cour@@ ts and build a par@@ k on the site .
And parents re@@ port something ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing .
"Be@@ fore , there was fe@@ ar of going any@@ where the st@@ ation , and now they say there &apos;s a sense that the cour@@ t is sa@@ f@@ er than other cour@@ ts ne@@ ar@@ by , and they pre@@ f@@ er their kids to play here ."
"So maybe in the future , on the public side of the st@@ ation , you might be able to dro@@ p in for a ha@@ ir@@ cut at the bar@@ ber@@ sho@@ p or re@@ ser@@ ve the community room for a bir@@ th@@ day par@@ ty or r@@ ene@@ w your dri@@ ver &apos;s li@@ cen@@ se or get money out of an A@@ T@@ M ."
"It can be a place for neigh@@ b@@ ors to me@@ et each other and to get to know the offi@@ c@@ ers , and vice ver@@ sa ."
This is not a ut@@ op@@ i@@ an fan@@ t@@ asy .
"It &apos;s about how do you design to re@@ build tr@@ ust , tru@@ st@@ ing relation@@ ships ?"
But re@@ imag@@ ining the buil@@ dings for the future is going to requi@@ re eng@@ ag@@ ing the people who live there .
"E@@ n@@ g@@ ag@@ ing the public can be in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ating , and I &apos;ve felt that , too ."
"But maybe that &apos;s because in archite@@ cture school , we don &apos;t really learn how to eng@@ age the public in the act of design ."
We &apos;re t@@ au@@ ght to def@@ end our design against cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ sm .
"But I think that can change , too ."
"So if we can fo@@ cus the design mind on cre@@ ating posi@@ tive , re@@ in@@ for@@ cing relation@@ ships in archite@@ cture and through archite@@ cture , I believe we can do much more than create individu@@ al buil@@ dings ."
We can redu@@ ce the stre@@ ss and the po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ ation in our urb@@ an ha@@ bi@@ tat@@ s .
We can create relation@@ ships .
We can help ste@@ ady this planet we all share .
Se@@ e ?
Ar@@ chi@@ te@@ cts really are relation@@ ship buil@@ ders .
( Laughter ) Thank you very much .

"I was one of the only kids in colle@@ ge who had a reason to go to the P@@ .@@ O@@ . box at the end of the day , and that was ma@@ in@@ ly because my mother has never belie@@ ved in e@@ ma@@ il , in F@@ ace@@ book , in te@@ x@@ ting or cell ph@@ ones in gener@@ al ."
"And so while other kids were B@@ B@@ M@@ -@@ ing their parents , I was liter@@ ally wai@@ ting by the ma@@ il@@ box to get a let@@ ter from home to see how the we@@ ek@@ end had gone , which was a little f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating when G@@ ran@@ d@@ ma was in the ho@@ spit@@ al , but I was just looking for some sort of sc@@ ri@@ b@@ ble , some un@@ k@@ em@@ pt cur@@ sive from my mother ."
"And so when I mo@@ ved to New York C@@ ity after colle@@ ge and got completely su@@ ck@@ er@@ -@@ pun@@ ched in the face by de@@ pres@@ sion , I did the only thing I could think of at the time ."
"I wro@@ te those same kinds of let@@ ters that my mother had wri@@ t@@ ten me for str@@ ang@@ ers , and tu@@ cked them all throu@@ gh@@ out the city , do@@ z@@ ens and do@@ z@@ ens of them . I left them every@@ where , in ca@@ f@@ es and in li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies , at the U.@@ N@@ . , every@@ where ."
"I blo@@ gg@@ ed about those let@@ ters and the days when they were ne@@ cess@@ ary , and I posed a kind of c@@ razy pro@@ mi@@ se to the Inter@@ net : that if you asked me for a hand@@ -@@ wri@@ t@@ ten let@@ ter , I would write you one , no questions asked ."
"O@@ ver@@ night , my in@@ box mor@@ ph@@ ed into this har@@ b@@ or of hear@@ t@@ bre@@ ak — a single mother in S@@ ac@@ ra@@ men@@ to , a girl being bu@@ l@@ lie@@ d in ru@@ ral K@@ ans@@ as , all as@@ king me , a 2@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old girl who bar@@ ely even knew her own co@@ f@@ fe@@ e order , to write them a love let@@ ter and give them a reason to wa@@ it by the ma@@ il@@ box ."
"Well , today I fu@@ el a global organiz@@ ation that is fu@@ e@@ led by those tri@@ ps to the ma@@ il@@ box , fu@@ e@@ led by the ways in which we can har@@ ness social media like never before to write and ma@@ il str@@ ang@@ ers let@@ ters when they need them most , but most of all , fu@@ e@@ led by c@@ r@@ ates of ma@@ il like this one , my tru@@ sty ma@@ il c@@ r@@ ate , fil@@ led with the sc@@ ri@@ p@@ t@@ ings of ordin@@ ary people , str@@ ang@@ ers writing let@@ ters to other str@@ ang@@ ers not because they &apos;re ever going to me@@ et and l@@ au@@ gh over a cu@@ p of co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , but because they have found one another by way of let@@ ter@@ -@@ writing ."
"But , you know , the thing that always gets me about these let@@ ters is that most of them have been wri@@ t@@ ten by people that have never known themselves lo@@ ved on a piece of pa@@ per ."
They could not tell you about the in@@ k of their own love let@@ ters .
"They &apos;re the ones from my gener@@ ation , the ones of us that have grow@@ n up into a world where everything is pa@@ per@@ less , and where some of our best convers@@ ations have happened upo@@ n a scre@@ en ."
"We have learned to di@@ ary our pa@@ in on@@ to F@@ ace@@ book , and we speak s@@ wi@@ f@@ tly in 1@@ 40 char@@ ac@@ ters or less ."
But what if it &apos;s not about ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy this time ?
"I was on the sub@@ way y@@ est@@ er@@ day with this ma@@ il c@@ r@@ ate , which is a convers@@ ation star@@ ter , let me tell you ."
"If you ever need one , just car@@ ry one of these . ( Laughter ) And a man just star@@ ed at me , and he was like , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you use the Inter@@ net ? &quot;"
"And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , si@@ r , I am not a strate@@ gi@@ st , no@@ r am I speci@@ ali@@ st . I am mer@@ ely a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler . &quot; &quot; And so I could tell you about a woman wh@@ ose h@@ us@@ b@@ and has just come home from Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , and she is having a hard time u@@ ne@@ ar@@ thing this thing called convers@@ ation , and so she tu@@ cks love let@@ ters throu@@ gh@@ out the house as a way to say , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome back to me ."
"F@@ ind me when you can . &quot; &quot; O@@ r a girl who deci@@ des that she is going to leave love let@@ ters around her cam@@ pu@@ s in D@@ u@@ bu@@ qu@@ e , I@@ owa , only to find her ef@@ for@@ ts ri@@ pp@@ le@@ -@@ effe@@ cted the next day when she wal@@ ks out on@@ to the qu@@ ad and fin@@ ds love let@@ ters h@@ ang@@ ing from the tre@@ es , tu@@ cked in the bus@@ h@@ es and the b@@ en@@ ch@@ es ."
"O@@ r the man who deci@@ des that he is going to take his life , uses F@@ ace@@ book as a way to say go@@ od@@ by@@ e to friends and family ."
"Well , ton@@ ight he sle@@ e@@ ps sa@@ fe@@ ly with a st@@ ack of let@@ ters just like this one tu@@ cked b@@ ene@@ ath his pi@@ l@@ low , sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ted by str@@ ang@@ ers who were there for him when ."
"These are the kinds of stories that con@@ v@@ in@@ ced me that let@@ ter@@ -@@ writing will never again need to fli@@ p back her ha@@ ir and talk about ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy , because she is an art form now , all the par@@ ts of her , the sig@@ ning , the sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ting , the ma@@ il@@ ing , the do@@ od@@ les in the mar@@ gin@@ s ."
"The m@@ ere fact that somebody would even just si@@ t down , pu@@ ll out a piece of pa@@ per and think about someone the whole way through , with an inten@@ tion that is so much har@@ der to u@@ ne@@ ar@@ th when the b@@ row@@ s@@ er is up and the i@@ P@@ h@@ one is p@@ ing@@ ing and we &apos;ve got six convers@@ ations rol@@ ling in at once , that is an art form that does not f@@ all down to the Go@@ li@@ ath of &quot; &quot; get f@@ ast@@ er , &quot; &quot; no matter how many social net@@ works we might jo@@ in ."
"We still clu@@ t@@ ch close these let@@ ters to our ch@@ est , to the words that speak l@@ ou@@ der than l@@ ou@@ d , when we turn p@@ ages into p@@ ale@@ t@@ tes to say the things that we have needed to say , the words that we have needed to write , to si@@ st@@ ers and bro@@ thers and even to str@@ ang@@ ers , for far too long ."
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
N@@ in@@ e@@ ty@@ -@@ n@@ ine percent of us have the dre@@ am of list@@ en@@ ers .
"N@@ ot being the musi@@ ci@@ ans — the list@@ en@@ ers , right ?"
"And we c@@ ra@@ ve one thing , even though we kind of don &apos;t know it all the time ."
"We c@@ ra@@ ve to be in the room with the musi@@ ci@@ an the day it was recor@@ ded , the day it was pla@@ yed ."
"And we go to live con@@ cer@@ ts , and we get that as much as we can ."
But then we list@@ en to the other 9@@ 9 percent of our stuff recor@@ ded .
"And it turns out the f@@ ur@@ ther back you go in history , the little rou@@ gh@@ er it sounds ."
"And so we said , there &apos;s a solution to this ."
"L@@ et &apos;s se@@ par@@ ate the perform@@ ance , as a thing , out from the recor@@ ding , which was how it was made ."
"You know , the thing with micro@@ ph@@ ones in the room and all that day ."
"But the perform@@ ance itself was how the musi@@ ci@@ ans worked their fin@@ g@@ ers , and what instru@@ ments they were using ."
And it &apos;s the data hi@@ d@@ den inside the recor@@ ding .
"In order to do this , it &apos;s a lot of har@@ dw@@ are and so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that ru@@ ns in a very high re@@ solution ."
And Y@@ am@@ a@@ h@@ a makes an incredible thing called the D@@ i@@ sk@@ la@@ vie@@ r P@@ r@@ o that looks like a nice gr@@ and pi@@ ano there .
"And you probably didn &apos;t realize it &apos;s going to do all these things — but full of sol@@ en@@ o@@ i@@ ds , and fi@@ ber op@@ ti@@ cs , and compu@@ ters and all this kind of stuff . The high@@ est re@@ solution out of J@@ ap@@ an ."
And this just didn &apos;t work until we could c@@ ross this line that says high-@@ defini@@ tion .
"And we were able to c@@ ross this line , called the un@@ can@@ ny val@@ ley , in terms of — arti@@ fi@@ cial inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence terms ."
"We have a process where we , you know , kind of put it into the computer and di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze it , and then a whole lot of an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s ."
"And we look at every single not@@ e , and all the at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes of those not@@ es : how hard they were stru@@ ck , and how they were he@@ ld down , and how you move the fin@@ g@@ ers ."
So we had to develo@@ p a whole new science of how you move your fin@@ g@@ ers .
"And , you know , it &apos;s a thing your pi@@ ano teach@@ er teach@@ es you , but we never had a science behind these kinds of things ."
I &apos;m going to start with G@@ len@@ n G@@ ould .
"He d@@ ied 25 years ago this year , and was born 7@@ 5 years ago this year ."
"W@@ as a be@@ lo@@ ved pi@@ ani@@ st , maybe the great cul@@ t pi@@ ani@@ st of the tw@@ ent@@ ie@@ th century ."
"He just got ti@@ red of being in front of an audience , and felt like — a perform@@ ing mon@@ key was , in fact , his ter@@ m ."
"So he ste@@ pped back , and did nothing but the c@@ ra@@ f@@ ting of his work ."
And G@@ ould &apos;s speci@@ al@@ ty was playing B@@ ach .
H@@ is maybe most fam@@ ous recor@@ ding was something called &quot; &quot; The G@@ ol@@ d@@ ber@@ g V@@ ari@@ ations . &quot; &quot; B@@ ach only wro@@ te the@@ mes and v@@ ari@@ ations one time .
"He wro@@ te some early pie@@ ces , but l@@ ate in his life , in his mat@@ ure per@@ i@@ od , he said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a the@@ me — 30 v@@ ari@@ ations . &quot; &quot; In fact , the the@@ me isn &apos;t even the me@@ lo@@ dy , it &apos;s the bas@@ s line ."
"And G@@ ould recor@@ ded it in two major recor@@ dings that you may know about , one in mon@@ o , and one in ster@@ e@@ o ."
"And the one in mon@@ o , by the way , he used the pe@@ d@@ al , and as he got ol@@ der , he said , &quot; &quot; No , no , wa@@ it a minu@@ te ."
"I &apos;m going to get very scienti@@ fic about this , and not use the pe@@ d@@ al . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like you to hear live is the 19@@ 5@@ 5 ver@@ sion , and we &apos;ll play the first couple pie@@ ces of it ."
"G@@ len@@ n G@@ ould , 19@@ 5@@ 5 ."
( Music ) How about that ?
( Applause ) So let me tell you a little bit how this was done .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , let me get you to the end ste@@ p ."
"This is — we have a fa@@ ir@@ ly comple@@ x process that , you know , so@@ f@@ tw@@ are and musi@@ ci@@ ans and so on , but when we &apos;re all done , we know that the e@@ ar is the fin@@ al ar@@ bi@@ ter ."
"We can play the ori@@ gin@@ al in one e@@ ar , and a new recor@@ ding in the other ."
"So I &apos;m going to do this for you right now , what you just heard ."
"And in the right spe@@ ak@@ er is going to be the ori@@ gin@@ al recor@@ ding , and the left spe@@ ak@@ er is going to be the new recor@@ ding , actually of an instru@@ ment just like that one , and I &apos;m going to play them together at the same time ."
( Music ) That &apos;s the ori@@ gin@@ al . &#91; U@@ n@@ clear &#93; That &apos;s the two together . ( Music )
"Be@@ fore &quot; &quot; Ju@@ ra@@ s@@ si@@ c Par@@ k , &quot; &quot; there was no science for how sk@@ in hun@@ g off of mus@@ cle , right ?"
"So , in the video world , we &apos;ve been able to inv@@ ent , in our li@@ fe@@ times , natural behavi@@ or ."
And this is kind of another example of pu@@ tting a science behind natural behavi@@ or .
And then you heard the ori@@ gin@@ al .
"U@@ l@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , I started with the experience ."
And the experience is : I want to be in the room and hear the musi@@ ci@@ ans .
L@@ ots of you can af@@ for@@ d to bu@@ y one of these .
"But , if not , there is now high-@@ defini@@ tion sur@@ round sound ."
"And I got to tell you , if you ha@@ ven &apos;t heard high-@@ defini@@ tion sur@@ round , go down to your au@@ di@@ o de@@ al@@ er , your au@@ di@@ op@@ hi@@ le de@@ al@@ er ."
It &apos;s so inv@@ ol@@ ving com@@ par@@ ed to regu@@ lar ster@@ e@@ o .
"But if you don &apos;t have that , maybe you can list@@ en on your he@@ ad@@ ph@@ ones ."
And so on the same dis@@ k we have five recor@@ dings — S@@ ony has five recor@@ dings .
And you could list@@ en in he@@ ad@@ ph@@ ones with this thing called bin@@ au@@ ral recor@@ ding .
"And it &apos;s a du@@ m@@ my head that si@@ ts in front of the instru@@ ment , and it &apos;s got micro@@ ph@@ ones where the ear@@ s are ."
"And when you put on he@@ ad@@ ph@@ ones , and you list@@ en to this , you &apos;re inside of G@@ len@@ n G@@ ould &apos;s body ."
"And it is a ch@@ u@@ ck@@ le until , you know , the musi@@ ci@@ ans , who are musi@@ ci@@ ans who play the pi@@ ano , list@@ en to this , say , &quot; I can &apos;t believe it ! It &apos;s just what it &apos;s like to play the pi@@ ano . &quot;"
"E@@ x@@ cept now you &apos;re inside G@@ len@@ n G@@ ould &apos;s body playing the pi@@ ano , and it feel@@ s like your fin@@ g@@ ers are making the deci@@ sions and moving through the whole process ."
It &apos;s a g@@ ame chang@@ er .
Here &apos;s now something we know in spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar qu@@ ality .
The whole process is very sen@@ si@@ tive to temper@@ ature and hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty .
What you heard today was not perfe@@ ct .
"It &apos;s an am@@ al@@ g@@ am of wood , and c@@ ast i@@ ro@@ n , and felt , and ste@@ el str@@ ings , and all these , and they &apos;re all amaz@@ ing@@ ly sen@@ si@@ tive to temper@@ ature and hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty ."
"So when you go into the recor@@ ding s@@ es@@ sion , you get to stop after every piece and re@@ build the pi@@ ano if you need to ."
"There &apos;s the whole action there , sitting , kind of , on the side , and the du@@ m@@ my head and our recor@@ ding engine@@ ers standing around while we re@@ build the pi@@ ano ."
"Wi@@ th@@ out pu@@ tting d@@ ates next to these things , ste@@ p@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ ste@@ p music will be turned into data , like every fie@@ ld that &apos;s oc@@ cur@@ red in the past 3@@ 5 or 40 years ."
"A@@ u@@ di@@ o has come very l@@ ate to this g@@ ame — I &apos;m not talking about di@@ gi@@ ti@@ z@@ ing , and bi@@ ts , and re@@ -@@ ma@@ ster@@ ing ."
"I &apos;m talking about turn it into the data that it was made from , which is how it was perform@@ ed ."
"And au@@ di@@ o came very l@@ ate because our ear@@ s are so hard to fo@@ ol — they &apos;re high-@@ re@@ solution , and they &apos;re wi@@ red stra@@ ight to our emoti@@ ons , and you can &apos;t tri@@ ck them very e@@ a@@ si@@ ly ."
"@@ Y@@ our eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement , you know ."
"A@@ ll right , there &apos;s this e@@ pis@@ od@@ e of &quot; &quot; St@@ ar T@@ re@@ k . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I get it — it was all just la@@ id in for me y@@ est@@ er@@ day there ."
The e@@ pis@@ od@@ e of &quot; &quot; St@@ ar T@@ re@@ k &quot; &quot; for me was J@@ am@@ es D@@ al@@ y pla@@ yed Me@@ th@@ us@@ el@@ ah — remember this one ?
"And at some point he &apos;s dan@@ cing with his — and I won &apos;t ru@@ in the e@@ pis@@ od@@ e for you , from 19@@ 6@@ 7 ."
"R@@ ight , do you know where I &apos;m going ?"
"And Ni@@ mo@@ y , I &apos;m sor@@ ry , S@@ po@@ ck si@@ ts down at the pi@@ ano , and he star@@ ts playing this Bra@@ h@@ ms wal@@ t@@ z , and they all dance to it ."
"And then S@@ po@@ ck turns round , he goes , &quot; &quot; J@@ am@@ es , I know all of the Bra@@ h@@ ms wal@@ t@@ z@@ es , and I don &apos;t believe this is one of them in the c@@ ate@@ g@@ ory . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s where I &apos;m at ."
I want to hear the wal@@ t@@ z@@ es Bra@@ h@@ ms didn &apos;t write .
I want to hear the pie@@ ces that H@@ o@@ ro@@ wit@@ z didn &apos;t play .
"But I believe we &apos;re on a pat@@ h now , when we get to data , that we can di@@ still sty@@ les , and tem@@ pl@@ ates , and for@@ mul@@ as , and all these kinds of things , again , that you &apos;ve seen happen in the computer gra@@ phi@@ cs world ."
It &apos;s now coming in this world .
The tran@@ si@@ tion will be this one .
"It says right now , we think music is not@@ es and how they &apos;re pla@@ yed ."
And I believe this is coming .
Because what you &apos;ve just heard was a computer playing data — no G@@ len@@ n G@@ ould in the room .
"But yet , it was human ."
"And I believe you &apos;ll get to the next ste@@ p , the real dre@@ am of list@@ en@@ ers ."
"E@@ very time you list@@ en to a recor@@ ding today , every time you take out your i@@ P@@ od and whatever , every time you list@@ en to it , it &apos;s the same thing — it &apos;s f@@ roz@@ en ."
"W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be cool if every time you list@@ en@@ ed , it could be different ?"
"This morning , you &apos;re s@@ ad@@ der , you want to hear your s@@ ong , the same s@@ ong , pla@@ yed s@@ ad@@ der than you did y@@ est@@ er@@ day ."
You want to hear it pla@@ yed by different musi@@ ci@@ ans .
You want to hear it in different ro@@ oms and whatever .
"We &apos;ve seen all these &quot; &quot; St@@ ar T@@ re@@ ks , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re all ho@@ lo@@ de@@ ck epi@@ so@@ des as well ."
"E@@ very time I list@@ en to that , I get go@@ ose bu@@ m@@ ps ."
"It &apos;s so amazing , it &apos;s so exci@@ ting ."
"E@@ very time I list@@ en to that recor@@ ding it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m in the same room . I can &apos;t believe this is happening . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a way better experience than whatever you &apos;re used to list@@ ening to , in whatever form ."
"And la@@ st@@ ly , I will w@@ ra@@ p up with one minu@@ te of Ar@@ t T@@ at@@ um ."
So I &apos;ve really over@@ sh@@ ot my bud@@ get here .
We made a new recor@@ ding of him playing in the S@@ h@@ r@@ ine Au@@ di@@ t@@ ori@@ um in Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber .
It was a con@@ cer@@ t he recor@@ ded in the S@@ h@@ r@@ ine Au@@ di@@ t@@ ori@@ um in 19@@ 4@@ 9 .
"And I &apos;ve got to tell you , we have this la@@ b where we build and meas@@ ure everything , back in R@@ ale@@ i@@ gh , Nor@@ th C@@ aro@@ lin@@ a , and we f@@ le@@ w out to L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les ."
"And as the pre@@ si@@ dent of the company , I didn &apos;t feel real comfor@@ table about where we were ."
