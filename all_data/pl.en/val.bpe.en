"When I was 11 , I remember wa@@ king up one morning to the sound of jo@@ y in my house ."
"My father was list@@ ening to B@@ B@@ C N@@ ew@@ s on his small , gra@@ y radi@@ o ."
"There was a big smi@@ le on his face which was un@@ usu@@ al then , because the news mo@@ st@@ ly de@@ pres@@ sed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A morning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan and made it il@@ leg@@ al for girls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I dre@@ s@@ sed as a bo@@ y to es@@ cor@@ t my ol@@ der si@@ ster , who was no longer allow@@ ed to be outside alone , to a se@@ cre@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be edu@@ c@@ ated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different rou@@ te so that no one would s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our boo@@ ks in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would se@@ em we were just out sh@@ op@@ ping .
"The school was in a house , more than 100 of us pac@@ ked in one small living room ."
It was co@@ zy in win@@ ter but extre@@ me@@ ly ho@@ t in sum@@ m@@ er .
"We all knew we were ri@@ sk@@ ing our lives — the teach@@ er , the students and our parents ."
"F@@ ro@@ m time to time , the school would sud@@ den@@ ly be can@@ ce@@ led for a week because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were s@@ us@@ pi@@ ci@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being fol@@ low@@ ed ?
Do they know where we live ?
"We were sc@@ ared , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very lu@@ ck@@ y to gro@@ w up in a family where education was pri@@ zed and d@@ augh@@ ters were tre@@ as@@ u@@ red .
My grand@@ father was an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary man for his time .
"A tot@@ al ma@@ ver@@ i@@ ck from a re@@ mot@@ e pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce of Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , he in@@ si@@ st@@ ed that his d@@ aughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was dis@@ ow@@ ned by his father ."
But my edu@@ c@@ ated mother became a teach@@ er .
There she is .
"S@@ he re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to re@@ cei@@ ve an education .
"There was no question that his children would re@@ cei@@ ve an education , inclu@@ ding his d@@ augh@@ ters , des@@ pi@@ te the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , des@@ pi@@ te the ri@@ sk@@ s ."
"To him , there was gre@@ ater ri@@ sk in not edu@@ c@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years , I remember there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated by our life and always being sc@@ ared and not seeing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , my d@@ aughter , you can lo@@ se everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be sto@@ le@@ n . You can be for@@ ced to leave your home during a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to se@@ ll our blo@@ od to pay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to contin@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; T@@ od@@ ay I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in a country that has been de@@ stro@@ yed by de@@ ca@@ des of war .
"F@@ ew@@ er than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ y@@ ond high school , and had my family not been so com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I stand here a pro@@ u@@ d gra@@ du@@ ate of Mi@@ dd@@ le@@ bu@@ ry Col@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) When I re@@ turned to Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , my grand@@ father , the one exi@@ led from his home for dar@@ ing to edu@@ cate his d@@ augh@@ ters , was am@@ ong the first to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate me ."
"He not only bra@@ gs about my colle@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l ."
( Applause ) My family belie@@ ves in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ am@@ s even bi@@ g@@ ger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to edu@@ cate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and per@@ haps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , a country where it &apos;s still ri@@ sk@@ y for girls to go to school ."
The exci@@ ting thing is that I see students at my school with am@@ bi@@ tion gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing at opportunity .
"And I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , des@@ pi@@ te and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ posi@@ tion ."
"L@@ i@@ ke A@@ h@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ med is the father of one of my students ."
"L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his d@@ aughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their vi@@ ll@@ age , and they liter@@ ally mis@@ sed being kil@@ led by a ro@@ ad@@ side b@@ om@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ ri@@ ved home , the phone ran@@ g , a vo@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he s@@ ent his d@@ aughter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ i@@ ll me now , if you wi@@ sh , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my d@@ aughter &apos;s future because of your old and back@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , and this is something that is often dis@@ mis@@ sed in the W@@ est , that behind most of us who suc@@ ce@@ ed is a father who re@@ cogni@@ z@@ es the val@@ ue in his d@@ aughter and who se@@ es that her suc@@ cess is his suc@@ cess ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mo@@ thers ar@@ en &apos;t key in our suc@@ cess .
"In fact , they &apos;re often the ini@@ tial and con@@ v@@ in@@ cing neg@@ oti@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their d@@ augh@@ ters , but in the con@@ te@@ xt of a society like in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , we must have the sup@@ port of men ."
"U@@ n@@ der the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , girls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hundre@@ ds — remember , it was il@@ leg@@ al ."
"But today , more than three million girls are in school in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan ."
( Applause ) Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Ameri@@ cans see the fra@@ gi@@ lity in chang@@ es .
I fe@@ ar that these chang@@ es will not last much be@@ y@@ ond the U.@@ S. tro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ wa@@ l .
"But when I am back in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , who en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge them , I see a pro@@ mis@@ ing future and la@@ st@@ ing change ."
"To me , Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan is a country of hope and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies , and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"L@@ i@@ ke me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
And you &apos;ll now see the y@@ ol@@ k and the white have se@@ par@@ ated .
And sli@@ gh@@ tly more comple@@ x things ap@@ pe@@ ar .
That &apos;s t@@ wi@@ ce as long as hum@@ ans have been on this planet .
"And de@@ ep b@@ ene@@ ath those oce@@ ans , at c@@ rac@@ ks in the Earth &apos;s c@@ r@@ ust , you &apos;ve got he@@ at see@@ ping up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great di@@ versity of ele@@ ments ."
"But of course , life is more than just ex@@ oti@@ c chemi@@ stry ."
H@@ um@@ an be@@ ings start pu@@ tting each other into bo@@ x@@ es the second that they see each other — Is that person d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ? A@@ re they at@@ trac@@ tive ?
A@@ re they a poten@@ tial m@@ ate ? A@@ re they a poten@@ tial net@@ working opportunity ?
We do this little inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation when we me@@ et people to make a ment@@ al re@@ su@@ me for them .
What &apos;s your name ? W@@ here are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Th@@ en we get more per@@ s@@ onal with it .
Ha@@ ve you ever had any dise@@ ases ?
Ha@@ ve you ever been di@@ v@@ or@@ ced ?
D@@ o@@ es your bre@@ ath s@@ me@@ ll bad while you &apos;re ans@@ wer@@ ing my inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation right now ?
What are you into ? Wh@@ o are you into ?
What gen@@ der do you like to sle@@ ep with ?
I get it .
We are neuro@@ logi@@ cally har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to se@@ ek out people like ourselves .
We start form@@ ing cli@@ qu@@ es as so@@ on as we &apos;re old enough to know what ac@@ cep@@ t@@ ance feel@@ s like .
"We b@@ ond together based on anything that we can — music pre@@ fer@@ ence , rac@@ e , gen@@ der , the blo@@ ck that we gre@@ w up on ."
We se@@ ek out environ@@ ments that re@@ in@@ force our per@@ s@@ onal cho@@ i@@ ces .
"S@@ ome@@ times , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s open@@ ing a t@@ iny little box and as@@ king you to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze yourself inside of it ."
"Because the c@@ ate@@ gor@@ ies , I &apos;ve found , are too li@@ mi@@ ting ."
The bo@@ x@@ es are too nar@@ row .
And this can get really d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
"So here &apos;s a di@@ sc@@ la@@ im@@ er about me , though , before we get too de@@ ep into this ."
I gre@@ w up in a very sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed environment .
"I was ra@@ is@@ ed in dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an in the early 19@@ 8@@ 0s , two blo@@ cks from the epi@@ cen@@ ter of pun@@ k music ."
I was sh@@ ie@@ l@@ ded from the pa@@ ins of bi@@ got@@ ry and the social re@@ stri@@ ctions of a religi@@ ous@@ ly@@ -@@ based up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing .
"W@@ here I come from , if you wer@@ en &apos;t a dra@@ g qu@@ e@@ en or a radi@@ cal thin@@ k@@ er or a perform@@ ance arti@@ st of some kind , you were the we@@ ir@@ do ."
"( Laughter ) It was an un@@ or@@ th@@ od@@ o@@ x up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing , but as a kid on the stre@@ ets of New York , you learn how to tr@@ ust your own in@@ st@@ in@@ cts , you learn how to go with your own ideas ."
"So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a bo@@ y ."
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball with them .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
"So I went home , and I sha@@ ved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a bo@@ y . &quot; &quot; I mean , who know@@ s , right ?"
"When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that ."
"I didn &apos;t want any@@ one to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t ."
I ke@@ pt up the char@@ ade for eight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was playing a kid na@@ med W@@ al@@ ter in a movie called &quot; &quot; Ju@@ li@@ an Po . &quot; &quot; I was a little stre@@ et t@@ ough that fol@@ low@@ ed Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an S@@ later around and bad@@ ger@@ ed him .
"S@@ e@@ e , I was also a child ac@@ tor , which d@@ ou@@ b@@ led up the la@@ y@@ ers of the perform@@ ance of my iden@@ ti@@ ty , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a bo@@ y ."
"In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teach@@ ers at school , not my friends , not the dire@@ ct@@ ors that I worked with ."
K@@ i@@ ds would often come up to me in clas@@ s and gra@@ b me by the th@@ ro@@ at to che@@ ck for an A@@ d@@ am &apos;s app@@ le or gra@@ b my cro@@ t@@ ch to che@@ ck what I was working with .
"When I would go to the ba@@ th@@ room , I would turn my sho@@ es around in the stal@@ ls so that it looked like I was pe@@ e@@ ing standing up ."
A@@ t sle@@ e@@ po@@ ver@@ s I would have p@@ ani@@ c att@@ ac@@ ks trying to bre@@ ak it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to k@@ is@@ s me without ou@@ ting myself .
It &apos;s wor@@ th men@@ tion@@ ing though that I didn &apos;t h@@ ate my body or my g@@ eni@@ t@@ ali@@ a .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was perform@@ ing this el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have qu@@ ali@@ f@@ ied as trans@@ gen@@ der .
"If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in ther@@ ap@@ y , they probably would have di@@ ag@@ no@@ sed me as something like gen@@ der dy@@ s@@ mor@@ phi@@ c and put me on hor@@ mon@@ es to sta@@ ve off pu@@ ber@@ ty ."
"But in my particular case , I just wo@@ ke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again ."
"P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty had h@@ it , and I had no idea what being a girl me@@ ant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was ."
"When a kid beha@@ ves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?"
No one is exactly sh@@ oc@@ ked .
( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to def@@ ine myself by my parents .
"When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fal@@ le@@ n in love , it was the last thing on either of our min@@ ds to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s what the con@@ sequ@@ ences were of the fact that my first love was a girl ."
"Th@@ ree years later , when I fe@@ ll in love with a man , ne@@ i@@ ther of my parents bat@@ ted an ey@@ el@@ as@@ h either ."
"S@@ e@@ e , it &apos;s one of the great bl@@ ess@@ ings of my very un@@ or@@ th@@ od@@ o@@ x chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to def@@ ine myself as any one thing at any point ."
"I was just allow@@ ed to be me , grow@@ ing and chang@@ ing in every moment ."
"So four , almost five years ago , Pro@@ posi@@ tion 8 , the great mar@@ ri@@ age equ@@ ality de@@ b@@ ate , was ra@@ is@@ ing a lot of d@@ ust around this country ."
"And at the time , getting mar@@ ried wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about ."
"But I was stru@@ ck by the fact that America , a country with such a tar@@ ni@@ shed ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts recor@@ d , could be re@@ pe@@ ating its mist@@ ak@@ es so b@@ lat@@ an@@ tly ."
"And I remember wat@@ ching the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion on tele@@ vision and thinking how interesting it was that the se@@ par@@ ation of ch@@ ur@@ ch and state was essen@@ ti@@ ally d@@ raw@@ ing ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies throu@@ gh@@ out this country , between places where people belie@@ ved in it and places where people didn &apos;t ."
"And then , that this di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion was d@@ raw@@ ing ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies around me ."
"If this was a war with two disp@@ ar@@ ate si@@ des , I , by def@@ au@@ l@@ t , fe@@ ll on team g@@ ay , because I cer@@ tain@@ ly wasn &apos;t 100 percent stra@@ ight ."
"A@@ t the time I was just beginning to em@@ er@@ ge from this e@@ igh@@ t-@@ year per@@ s@@ onal iden@@ ti@@ ty cri@@ sis zi@@ g@@ za@@ g that saw me go from being a bo@@ y to being this aw@@ k@@ ward girl that looked like a bo@@ y in girl &apos;s clo@@ the@@ s to the op@@ posi@@ te extre@@ me of this su@@ per sk@@ im@@ py , over@@ -@@ comp@@ en@@ s@@ ating , bo@@ y@@ -@@ ch@@ as@@ ing gir@@ ly@@ -@@ girl to finally just a he@@ si@@ t@@ ant expl@@ or@@ ation of what I actually was , a tom@@ bo@@ y@@ is@@ h girl who li@@ ked both bo@@ ys and girls depen@@ ding on the person ."
"I had spent a year photograph@@ ing this new gener@@ ation of girls , much like myself , who fe@@ ll kind of bet@@ we@@ en@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ lin@@ es — girls who sk@@ ate@@ bo@@ ar@@ ded but did it in l@@ acy under@@ we@@ ar , girls who had bo@@ ys &apos; ha@@ ir@@ cu@@ ts but wor@@ e gir@@ ly na@@ il poli@@ sh , girls who had ey@@ es@@ ha@@ do@@ w to mat@@ ch their sc@@ ra@@ ped k@@ ne@@ es , girls who li@@ ked girls and bo@@ ys who all li@@ ked bo@@ ys and girls who all h@@ ated being bo@@ x@@ ed in to anything ."
"I lo@@ ved these people , and I ad@@ mi@@ red their fre@@ e@@ dom , but I wat@@ ched as the world outside of our ut@@ op@@ i@@ an bu@@ b@@ ble ex@@ plo@@ ded into these ra@@ g@@ ing de@@ b@@ ates where pun@@ di@@ ts started li@@ k@@ ening our love to be@@ sti@@ ality on national tele@@ vision ."
"And this powerful aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess rol@@ led in over me that I was a min@@ ori@@ ty , and in my own home country , based on one fac@@ et of my char@@ ac@@ ter ."
I was leg@@ ally and indi@@ sp@@ ut@@ ably a secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en .
I was not an acti@@ vi@@ st .
I wa@@ ve no fl@@ ag@@ s in my own life .
But I was pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed by this question : How could any@@ one v@@ ot@@ e to stri@@ p the ri@@ ghts of the v@@ ast v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of people that I knew based on one ele@@ ment of their char@@ ac@@ ter ?
How could they say that we as a group were not des@@ er@@ ving of equ@@ al ri@@ ghts as somebody else ?
W@@ ere we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously met a vi@@ cti@@ m of their di@@ sc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation ?
D@@ id they know who they were v@@ ot@@ ing against and what the impac@@ t was ?
"And then it oc@@ cur@@ red to me , per@@ haps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were ca@@ st@@ ing into secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ ship it might make it har@@ der for them to do ."
It might give them pa@@ use .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same din@@ ner par@@ ty , so I figu@@ red out a way where I could in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce them to each other photogra@@ phi@@ cally without any arti@@ fi@@ ce , without any li@@ gh@@ ting , or without any m@@ ani@@ pul@@ ation of any kind on my part ."
Because in a photogra@@ ph you can exam@@ ine a li@@ on &apos;s whi@@ sk@@ ers without the fe@@ ar of him ri@@ pping your face off .
"For me , photograph@@ y is not just about ex@@ pos@@ ing film , it &apos;s about ex@@ pos@@ ing the vie@@ wer to something new , a place they ha@@ ven &apos;t gone before , but most import@@ an@@ tly , to people that they might be af@@ ra@@ id of ."
"L@@ i@@ fe mag@@ az@@ ine in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced gener@@ ations of people to di@@ st@@ ant , far@@ -@@ off cul@@ tu@@ res they never knew ex@@ ist@@ ed through pi@@ ctures ."
"So I decided to make a ser@@ ies of very simple por@@ tra@@ its , mu@@ g@@ sh@@ ots if you will ."
"And I basically decided to photogra@@ ph any@@ one in this country that was not 100 percent stra@@ ight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a li@@ mi@@ t@@ less number of people ."
"( Laughter ) So this was a very large under@@ taking , and to do it we needed some help ."
"So I ran out in the fre@@ e@@ z@@ ing c@@ old , and I photograph@@ ed every single person that I knew that I could get to in F@@ e@@ bru@@ ary of about two years ago ."
"And I took those photograph@@ s , and I went to the H@@ R@@ C and I asked them for some help ."
And they fun@@ ded two weeks of sho@@ ot@@ ing in New York .
And then we made this .
"( Music ) V@@ ide@@ o : I &apos;m i@@ O T@@ il@@ let@@ t W@@ right , and I &apos;m an arti@@ st born and ra@@ is@@ ed in New York C@@ ity . ( Music )"
S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is a photogra@@ phi@@ c recor@@ d of L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q America today .
My a@@ im is to take a simple por@@ tra@@ it of any@@ one who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent stra@@ ight or feel@@ s like they f@@ all in the L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m in any way .
My go@@ al is to show the hum@@ ani@@ ty that ex@@ ist@@ s in every one of us through the sim@@ pli@@ city of a face .
( Music ) &quot; We h@@ old these tru@@ ths to be self-@@ evi@@ dent that all men are created equ@@ al . &quot;
It &apos;s wri@@ t@@ ten in the De@@ c@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ depen@@ dence .
We are fa@@ il@@ ing as a n@@ ation to u@@ ph@@ old the mor@@ als upo@@ n which we were f@@ oun@@ ded .
There is no equ@@ ality in the United States .

The fi@@ ght for equ@@ al ri@@ ghts is not just about g@@ ay mar@@ ri@@ age .
"T@@ od@@ ay in 2@@ 9 st@@ ates , more than half of this country , you can leg@@ ally be fi@@ red just for your se@@ x@@ u@@ ality ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o is respon@@ si@@ ble for equ@@ ality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundre@@ ds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all respon@@ si@@ ble for equ@@ ality . &quot;
So far we &apos;ve sh@@ ot 3@@ 00 fac@@ es in New York C@@ ity .
And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the gener@@ ous sup@@ port of the H@@ um@@ an R@@ igh@@ ts C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
I want to take the project across the country .
"I want to visi@@ t 25 American cities , and I want to sho@@ ot 4@@ ,000 or 5@@ ,000 people ."
This is my con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to the ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts fi@@ ght of my gener@@ ation .

"A@@ l@@ most 8@@ 5@@ ,000 people wat@@ ched that video , and then they started e@@ ma@@ il@@ ing us from all over the country , as@@ king us to come to their tow@@ ns and help them to show their fac@@ es ."
And a lot more people wanted to show their fac@@ es than I had anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed .
"So I changed my im@@ medi@@ ate go@@ al to 1@@ 0,000 fac@@ es ."
"That video was made in the sp@@ ring of 20@@ 11 , and as of today I have tra@@ ve@@ led to almost 20 cities and photograph@@ ed almost 2@@ ,000 people ."
"I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minu@@ te of just qu@@ ie@@ t and have you just look at these fac@@ es because there is nothing that I can say that will ad@@ d to them ."
"Because if a picture is wor@@ th a thous@@ and words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ lar@@ y ."
"So after tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing and talking to people in places like O@@ k@@ la@@ hom@@ a or s@@ mal@@ l-@@ tow@@ n T@@ ex@@ as , we found evi@@ dence that the ini@@ tial pre@@ mi@@ se was de@@ ad on ."
V@@ i@@ si@@ bility really is key .
F@@ ami@@ li@@ ari@@ ty really is the g@@ ate@@ way dru@@ g to em@@ pa@@ th@@ y .
"O@@ n@@ ce an issue po@@ ps up in your own back@@ y@@ ard or am@@ on@@ g@@ st your own family , you &apos;re far more li@@ ke@@ ly to expl@@ ore sym@@ pa@@ th@@ y for it or expl@@ ore a new perspe@@ ctive on it ."
"O@@ f course , in my tra@@ v@@ els I met people who leg@@ ally di@@ v@@ or@@ ced their children for being other than stra@@ ight , but I also met people who were S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ sts who s@@ wit@@ ched ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es because their child was a l@@ es@@ bi@@ an ."
S@@ par@@ king em@@ pa@@ th@@ y had become the back@@ b@@ one of S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths .
But here &apos;s what I was star@@ ting to learn that was really interesting : S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths doesn &apos;t er@@ ase the differ@@ ences between us .
"In fact , on the con@@ tr@@ ary , it high@@ li@@ ghts them ."
"It pre@@ sen@@ ts , not just the comple@@ x@@ it@@ ies found in a pro@@ ces@@ sion of different human be@@ ings , but the comple@@ x@@ it@@ ies found within each individu@@ al person ."
"It wasn &apos;t that we had too many bo@@ x@@ es , it was that we had too few ."
"A@@ t some point I realized that my mis@@ sion to photogra@@ ph &quot; &quot; ga@@ ys &quot; &quot; was in@@ her@@ ently fl@@ aw@@ ed , because there were a million different sha@@ des of g@@ ay ."
"H@@ ere I was trying to help , and I had per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated the very thing I had spent my life trying to av@@ o@@ id — yet another box ."
A@@ t some point I ad@@ ded a question to the rele@@ ase form that asked people to qu@@ anti@@ fy themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent g@@ ay .
And I wat@@ ched so many ex@@ ist@@ enti@@ al cri@@ ses un@@ f@@ old in front of me .
( Laughter ) Pe@@ ople didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been pre@@ sen@@ ted with the op@@ tion before .
C@@ an you qu@@ anti@@ fy your open@@ ness ?
"O@@ n@@ ce they got over the sho@@ ck , though , by and large people op@@ ted for some@@ where between 70 to 9@@ 5 percent or the 3 to 20 percent mar@@ ks ."
"O@@ f course , there were lots of people who op@@ ted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much lar@@ ger pro@@ por@@ tion of people iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ied as something that was much more nu@@ an@@ ced ."
I found that most people f@@ all on a spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of what I have come to ref@@ er to as &quot; &quot; Gre@@ y . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that pre@@ fer@@ ence doesn &apos;t exi@@ st .
"And I am not even going to ad@@ dre@@ ss the issue of cho@@ ice ver@@ su@@ s biologi@@ cal im@@ per@@ ative , because if any of you happen to be of the belie@@ f that se@@ x@@ u@@ al or@@ ien@@ tation is a cho@@ ice , I in@@ vi@@ te you to go out and try to be gre@@ y ."
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human be@@ ings are not one@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal .
"The most important thing to take from the per@@ cent@@ age system is this : If you have g@@ ay people over here and you have stra@@ ight people over here , and while we re@@ cogni@@ ze that most people iden@@ ti@@ fy as some@@ where clo@@ s@@ er to one bin@@ ary or another , there is this v@@ ast spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of people that exi@@ st in between ."
And the re@@ ality that this pre@@ sen@@ ts is a comp@@ lic@@ ated one .
"Because , for example , if you pas@@ s a la@@ w that allow@@ s a b@@ os@@ s to fi@@ re an em@@ plo@@ ye@@ e for hom@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al behavi@@ or , where exactly do you dra@@ w the line ?"
"I@@ s it over here , by the people who have had one or two he@@ ter@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al exper@@ ien@@ ces so far ?"
O@@ r is it over here by the people who have only had one or two hom@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al exper@@ ien@@ ces th@@ us far ?
W@@ here exactly does one become a secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ?
A@@ no@@ ther interesting thing that I learned from my project and my tra@@ v@@ els is just what a po@@ or bin@@ ding ag@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al or@@ ien@@ tation is .
"A@@ f@@ ter tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing so much and me@@ e@@ ting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many j@@ er@@ ks and s@@ wee@@ the@@ ar@@ ts and De@@ moc@@ rat@@ s and Re@@ publi@@ cans and jo@@ cks and qu@@ e@@ ens and every other po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ ation you can possi@@ bly think of within the L@@ G@@ B@@ T community as there are within the human rac@@ e ."
"A@@ side from the fact that we play with one leg@@ al hand t@@ ied behind our bac@@ ks , and once you get past the sh@@ ared nar@@ r@@ ative of pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce and stru@@ gg@@ le , just being other than stra@@ ight doesn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly mean that we have anything in common ."
"So in the en@@ d@@ less pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of fac@@ es that S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is always be@@ coming , as it hop@@ e@@ fully ap@@ pe@@ ars across more and more pl@@ at@@ form@@ s , bu@@ s sh@@ el@@ ters , bi@@ ll@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , F@@ ace@@ book p@@ ages , scre@@ en sa@@ ver@@ s , per@@ haps in wat@@ ching this pro@@ ces@@ sion of hum@@ ani@@ ty , something interesting and us@@ e@@ ful will beg@@ in to happen ."
"H@@ op@@ e@@ fully these c@@ ate@@ gor@@ ies , these bin@@ ar@@ ies , these over@@ -@@ sim@@ pli@@ f@@ ied bo@@ x@@ es will beg@@ in to become us@@ el@@ ess and they &apos;ll beg@@ in to f@@ all away ."
"Because really , they descri@@ be nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are ."
What we see are human be@@ ings in all their mul@@ ti@@ pli@@ city .
And seeing them makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their hum@@ ani@@ ty .
A@@ t the very least I hope it makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their human ri@@ ghts .
"So is it me parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly that you would cho@@ ose to den@@ y the right to h@@ ous@@ ing , the right to ad@@ op@@ t children , the right to mar@@ ri@@ age , the fre@@ e@@ dom to sho@@ p here , live here , bu@@ y here ?"

It &apos;s too l@@ ate .
Because I already am all of those things .
"We already are all of those things , and we always have been ."
"So ple@@ ase don &apos;t gre@@ et us as str@@ ang@@ ers , gre@@ et us as your fel@@ low human be@@ ings , per@@ i@@ od ."

"In Indi@@ a and Ne@@ p@@ al , I was in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced to the bri@@ ck kil@@ ns ."
This str@@ ange and aw@@ es@@ ome si@@ ght was like wal@@ king into an@@ cient E@@ g@@ y@@ pt or D@@ an@@ te &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
"E@@ n@@ velo@@ ped in temper@@ at@@ ures of 1@@ 30 de@@ gre@@ es , men , women , children , entire fam@@ il@@ ies in fact , were clo@@ ak@@ ed in a he@@ av@@ y bl@@ an@@ k@@ et of d@@ ust , while mechani@@ cally st@@ ac@@ king bri@@ cks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and car@@ ry@@ ing them from the sc@@ or@@ ching kil@@ ns to tru@@ cks hundre@@ ds of y@@ ar@@ ds away ."
"D@@ e@@ ad@@ en@@ ed by mon@@ ot@@ ony and ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sti@@ on , they work sil@@ ently , doing this t@@ ask over and over for 16 or 1@@ 7 hours a day ."
"There were no bre@@ ak@@ s for food , no water bre@@ ak@@ s , and the se@@ v@@ ere de@@ hy@@ d@@ r@@ ation made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al ."
So per@@ v@@ a@@ sive was the he@@ at and the d@@ ust that my cam@@ era became too ho@@ t to even tou@@ ch and ce@@ as@@ ed working .
"E@@ very 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our c@@ ru@@ is@@ er to cle@@ an out my ge@@ ar and run it under an air con@@ di@@ tion@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it , and as I s@@ at there , I thought , my cam@@ era is getting far better tre@@ at@@ ment than these people ."
"B@@ ack in the kil@@ ns , I wanted to c@@ ry , but the ab@@ o@@ li@@ ti@@ oni@@ st next to me quickly gra@@ b@@ bed me and he said , &quot; &quot; L@@ is@@ a , don &apos;t do that .

I couldn &apos;t of@@ f@@ er them any dire@@ ct help .
"I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing ."
I wasn &apos;t a ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en of that country .
I could get them in a wor@@ se situ@@ ation than they were already in .
"I &apos;d have to re@@ ly on F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves to work within the system for their li@@ ber@@ ation , and I tru@@ st@@ ed that they would ."
"As for me , I &apos;d have to wa@@ it until I got home to really feel my hear@@ t@@ bre@@ ak ."
"In the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as , I found children car@@ ry@@ ing st@@ one for miles down m@@ oun@@ tain@@ ous ter@@ ra@@ in to tru@@ cks wai@@ ting at ro@@ ads be@@ low ."
"The big sh@@ e@@ ets of sl@@ ate were he@@ a@@ vie@@ r than the children car@@ ry@@ ing them , and the kids ho@@ ist@@ ed them from their he@@ ads using these hand@@ made har@@ n@@ ess@@ es of sti@@ cks and rop@@ e and tor@@ n c@@ lot@@ h ."
It &apos;s difficult to wit@@ ness something so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
"H@@ ow can we af@@ fe@@ ct something so in@@ si@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ v@@ a@@ sive ?"
"S@@ ome don &apos;t even know they &apos;re en@@ s@@ la@@ ved , people working 16 , 1@@ 7 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives ."
They have nothing to comp@@ are it to .
"When these vi@@ ll@@ ag@@ ers c@@ la@@ im@@ ed their fre@@ e@@ dom , the s@@ la@@ ve@@ hol@@ ders bur@@ ned down all of their h@@ ous@@ es ."
"I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so pe@@ tri@@ f@@ ied , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the cen@@ ter r@@ al@@ lie@@ d for them to per@@ se@@ v@@ ere , and ab@@ o@@ li@@ tion@@ ist@@ s on the ground hel@@ ped them get a qu@@ ar@@ ry le@@ ase of their own , so that now they do the same back@@ -@@ bre@@ aking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get pa@@ id for it , and they do it in fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"S@@ e@@ x traf@@ fi@@ c@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word s@@ la@@ very , and because of this wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work sa@@ fe@@ ly within this particular indu@@ stry ."
"In K@@ a@@ th@@ m@@ and@@ u , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had pre@@ vi@@ ously been se@@ x s@@ la@@ ves themselves ."
"They us@@ her@@ ed me down a nar@@ row set of sta@@ ir@@ s that led to this di@@ r@@ ty , di@@ m@@ ly flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent li@@ t bas@@ ement ."
"This wasn &apos;t a bro@@ the@@ l , per se ."
It was more like a re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant .
"C@@ ab@@ in re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts , as they &apos;re known in the tra@@ de , are ven@@ u@@ es for for@@ ced pro@@ stitu@@ tion ."
"E@@ ach has small , pri@@ v@@ ate ro@@ oms , where the s@@ la@@ ves , women , along with young girls and bo@@ ys , some as young as seven years old , are for@@ ced to en@@ ter@@ tain the cl@@ ien@@ ts , en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing them to bu@@ y more food and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ."
"E@@ ach cu@@ bi@@ cle is dar@@ k and din@@ gy , iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ied with a pain@@ ted number on the w@@ all , and parti@@ tion@@ ed by pl@@ y@@ wood and a cur@@ tain ."
The wor@@ k@@ ers here often en@@ du@@ re tra@@ gi@@ c se@@ x@@ u@@ al ab@@ use at the h@@ ands of their cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers .
"S@@ tan@@ ding in the ne@@ ar dar@@ k@@ ness , I remember feeling this qui@@ ck , ho@@ t fe@@ ar , and in that in@@ st@@ ant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be tra@@ pped in that he@@ ll ."
I had only one way out : the sta@@ ir@@ s from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back do@@ ors .
There were no win@@ dow@@ s large enough to clim@@ b through .
"These people have no es@@ cape at all , and as we take in such a difficult sub@@ je@@ ct , it &apos;s important to not@@ e that s@@ la@@ very , inclu@@ ding se@@ x traf@@ fi@@ c@@ king , oc@@ cur@@ s in our own back@@ y@@ ard as well ."
"T@@ ens of hundre@@ ds of people are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in agri@@ culture , in re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts , in dom@@ esti@@ c ser@@ vi@@ tu@@ de , and the li@@ st can go on ."
"R@@ e@@ cent@@ ly , the New York T@@ im@@ es re@@ por@@ ted that between 10@@ 0,000 and 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 American children are s@@ old into se@@ x s@@ la@@ very every year ."
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The te@@ x@@ ti@@ le indu@@ stry is another one we often think of when we hear about s@@ la@@ ve lab@@ or .
I visi@@ ted vi@@ ll@@ ages in Indi@@ a where entire fam@@ il@@ ies were en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in the sil@@ k tra@@ de .
This is a family por@@ tra@@ it .
"The dy@@ ed black h@@ ands are the father , while the blue and red h@@ ands are his s@@ ons ."
"They mi@@ x dy@@ e in these big bar@@ re@@ ls , and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the sil@@ k into the li@@ qu@@ id up to their el@@ bow@@ s , but the dy@@ e is to@@ x@@ ic ."
My inter@@ pre@@ ter told me their stories .
"&quot; &quot; We have no fre@@ e@@ dom , &quot; &quot; they said ."
"&quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get pa@@ id for our dy@@ e@@ ing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s est@@ im@@ ated that more than 4@@ ,000 children are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved on L@@ ake V@@ ol@@ ta , the largest man@@ -@@ made l@@ ake in the world ."
"When we first ar@@ ri@@ ved , I went to have a qui@@ ck look ."
"I saw what seem@@ ed to be a family fi@@ sh@@ ing on a boat , two ol@@ der bro@@ thers , some youn@@ ger kids , makes sense right ?"
W@@ rong . They were all en@@ s@@ la@@ ved .
"Ch@@ il@@ dren are taken from their fam@@ il@@ ies and traf@@ fi@@ cked and v@@ ani@@ shed , and they &apos;re for@@ ced to work en@@ d@@ less hours on these bo@@ ats on the l@@ ake , even though they do not know how to s@@ wi@@ m ."
This young child is eight years old .
"He was tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling when our boat appro@@ ach@@ ed , f@@ ri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed it would run over his t@@ iny can@@ o@@ e ."
He was pe@@ tri@@ f@@ ied he would be k@@ noc@@ ked in the water .
"The sk@@ ele@@ tal t@@ ree lim@@ b@@ s sub@@ mer@@ g@@ ed in L@@ ake V@@ ol@@ ta often cat@@ ch the fi@@ sh@@ ing ne@@ ts , and we@@ ary , f@@ ri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed children are th@@ row@@ n into the water to un@@ te@@ ther the lin@@ es ."
M@@ any of them d@@ row@@ n .
"For as long as he can re@@ call , he &apos;s been for@@ ced to work on the l@@ ake ."
"T@@ er@@ ri@@ f@@ ied of his ma@@ ster , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been tre@@ ated with c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty all his life , he pas@@ ses that down to the youn@@ ger s@@ la@@ ves that he man@@ ages ."
"I met these bo@@ ys at five in the morning , when they were ha@@ u@@ ling in the last of their ne@@ ts , but they had been working since 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
"@@ in the c@@ old , win@@ dy night ."
And it &apos;s important to not@@ e that these ne@@ ts we@@ i@@ gh more than a thous@@ and po@@ un@@ ds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was re@@ s@@ cu@@ ed from a fi@@ sh@@ ing vi@@ ll@@ age .
I met him at a sh@@ el@@ ter where F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves re@@ ha@@ bi@@ lit@@ ates vi@@ cti@@ ms of s@@ la@@ very .
"H@@ ere he &apos;s seen taking a b@@ ath at the well , po@@ ur@@ ing big bu@@ c@@ ke@@ ts of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , K@@ of@@ i has been re@@ uni@@ ted with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given to@@ ols to make a living and to keep their children sa@@ fe ."
K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bod@@ im@@ ent of possi@@ bility .
Wh@@ o will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
"D@@ ri@@ ving down a ro@@ ad in G@@ h@@ ana with part@@ n@@ ers of F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves , a fel@@ low ab@@ o@@ li@@ ti@@ oni@@ st on a mo@@ ped sud@@ den@@ ly sp@@ ed up to our c@@ ru@@ is@@ er and ta@@ pped on the win@@ do@@ w ."
He told us to fol@@ low him down a di@@ r@@ t ro@@ ad into the j@@ un@@ g@@ le .
"A@@ t the end of the ro@@ ad , he ur@@ g@@ ed us out of the car , and told the dri@@ ver to quickly leave ."
"Th@@ en he poin@@ ted tow@@ ard this bar@@ ely visi@@ ble fo@@ ot@@ pat@@ h , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the pat@@ h , this is the pat@@ h .

"A@@ f@@ ter another two hours of hi@@ king , the win@@ ding tra@@ il ab@@ ru@@ p@@ tly en@@ ded at a c@@ lear@@ ing , and before us was a mas@@ s of ho@@ les that could f@@ it into the size of a fo@@ ot@@ ball fie@@ ld , and all of them were full of en@@ s@@ la@@ ved people labor@@ ing ."
"M@@ any women had children stra@@ pped to their bac@@ ks while they were pan@@ ning for g@@ old , wa@@ ding in water po@@ is@@ on@@ ed by mer@@ cu@@ ry ."
M@@ er@@ cu@@ ry is used in the ex@@ trac@@ tion process .
These min@@ ers are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in a m@@ ine sha@@ ft in another part of G@@ h@@ ana .
"When they came out of the sha@@ ft , they were so@@ aking w@@ et from their own s@@ we@@ at ."
"I remember looking into their ti@@ red , blo@@ od@@ sh@@ ot eyes , for many of them had been under@@ ground for 7@@ 2 hours ."
"The sha@@ f@@ ts are up to 3@@ 00 fe@@ et de@@ ep , and they car@@ ry out he@@ av@@ y b@@ ag@@ s of st@@ one that later will be transpor@@ ted to another area , where the st@@ one will be po@@ un@@ ded so that they can ex@@ trac@@ t the g@@ old ."
"A@@ t first gl@@ ance , the po@@ un@@ ding site seem@@ s full of powerful men , but when we look clo@@ s@@ er , we see some less for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate working on the fr@@ ing@@ es , and children too ."
"A@@ ll of them are vi@@ cti@@ m to in@@ j@@ ury , il@@ l@@ ness and violence ."
"In fact , it &apos;s very li@@ ke@@ ly that this mus@@ cular person will end up like this one here , rac@@ ked with tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mer@@ cu@@ ry po@@ is@@ on@@ ing in just a few years ."
"This is M@@ an@@ ur@@ u . When his father d@@ ied , his un@@ cle traf@@ fi@@ cked him to work with him in the min@@ es ."
"When his un@@ cle d@@ ied , M@@ an@@ ur@@ u in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted his un@@ cle &apos;s de@@ b@@ t , which f@@ ur@@ ther for@@ ced him into being en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in the min@@ es ."

"In an age of global stri@@ fe and clim@@ ate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is se@@ x so dam@@ n good ?"
"If you &apos;re l@@ augh@@ ing , you know what I mean ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s why . B@@ ack in uni@@ versity , we had a qui@@ ck project to design some sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed clo@@ cks ."
Here &apos;s my clo@@ ck .
"It uses something called the d@@ war@@ f su@@ n@@ f@@ low@@ er , which grow@@ s to about 12 in@@ ch@@ es in he@@ ight ."
"Now , as you know , su@@ n@@ f@@ low@@ ers tr@@ ack the su@@ n during the course of the day ."
"So in the morning , you see which dire@@ ction the su@@ n@@ f@@ low@@ er is fac@@ ing , and you mar@@ k it on the bl@@ ank area in the b@@ ase ."
"A@@ t no@@ on , you mar@@ k the changed posi@@ tion of the su@@ n@@ f@@ low@@ er , and in the ev@@ ening again , and that &apos;s your clo@@ ck ."
"Now , I know my clo@@ ck doesn &apos;t tell you the ex@@ act time , but it does give you a gener@@ al idea using a f@@ low@@ er ."
"So , in my completely un@@ bi@@ as@@ ed , sub@@ je@@ ctive op@@ ini@@ on , it &apos;s bri@@ lli@@ ant ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , here &apos;s Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck ."
It &apos;s five mag@@ ni@@ f@@ ying gl@@ as@@ ses with a sh@@ ot gl@@ as@@ s under each one .
In each sh@@ ot gl@@ as@@ s is a different scen@@ ted oil .
"In the morning , the su@@ n@@ light will sh@@ ine down on the first mag@@ ni@@ f@@ ying gl@@ as@@ s , fo@@ c@@ using a be@@ am of light on the sh@@ ot gl@@ as@@ s under@@ ne@@ ath ."
"This will war@@ m up the scen@@ ted oil inside , and a particular s@@ me@@ ll will be e@@ mi@@ t@@ ted ."
"So during the course of the day , five different s@@ me@@ l@@ ls are disp@@ er@@ sed throu@@ gh@@ out that environment ."
An@@ y@@ one living in that house can tell the time just by the s@@ me@@ ll .
You can see why I h@@ ate Ch@@ ris .
One thing you have to know about me is I h@@ ate to lo@@ se .
This problem &apos;s been bu@@ gg@@ ing me for well over a dec@@ ade .
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why se@@ x is so good ."
"M@@ any years after the solar power@@ ed clo@@ cks project , a young l@@ ady I knew su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed maybe se@@ x is so good because of the five sen@@ ses ."
"And when she said this , I had an epi@@ ph@@ any ."
So I decided to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate different exper@@ ien@@ ces I had in my life from the point of view of the five sen@@ ses .
"To do this , I de@@ vi@@ sed something called the five sen@@ ses gra@@ ph ."
"A@@ long the y@@ -@@ ax@@ is , you have a scale from zer@@ o to 10 , and along the x@@ -@@ ax@@ is , you have , of course , the five sen@@ ses ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ time I had a memor@@ able experience in my life , I would recor@@ d it on this gra@@ ph like a five sen@@ ses di@@ ary ."
Here &apos;s a qui@@ ck video to show you how it works .
"B@@ i@@ ke desig@@ ner : This is &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , cu@@ st@@ om bi@@ ke desig@@ ner ."
( M@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ le re@@ v@@ ving ) &#91; S@@ ound &#93; &#91; T@@ ou@@ ch &#93; &#91; S@@ ight &#93; &#91; S@@ me@@ ll &#93; &#91; T@@ ast@@ e &#93; J@@ L : And that &apos;s how the five sen@@ ses gra@@ ph works .
So here are some other resul@@ ts .
The first is for in@@ st@@ ant no@@ od@@ les .
"Now obvi@@ ously , ta@@ ste and s@@ me@@ ll are quite high , but noti@@ ce sound is at three ."
"You know . ( S@@ lu@@ r@@ ps ) Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , I no longer d@@ ine with these people ."
"O@@ K , next , clu@@ b@@ b@@ ing ."
These people I still do h@@ an@@ g out with .
"A@@ ll right , and smo@@ king ."
"H@@ ere I found tou@@ ch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reas@@ ons is that smo@@ k@@ ers told me the sen@@ s@@ ation of hol@@ ding a ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te and br@@ ing@@ ing it up to your li@@ ps is a big part of the smo@@ king experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of sc@@ ary to think how well ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes are desig@@ ned by the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers ."
"O@@ K . Now , what would the perfe@@ ct experience look like on the five sen@@ ses gra@@ ph ?"
"It would , of course , be a h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tal line along the top ."
"Now you can see , not even as inten@@ se an experience as ri@@ ding a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke comes close ."
"In fact , in the years that I ga@@ ther@@ ed data , only one experience came close to being the perfe@@ ct one ."
"That is , of course , se@@ x . Gre@@ at se@@ x ."
R@@ es@@ pon@@ d@@ ents said that great se@@ x hi@@ ts all of the five sen@@ ses at an extre@@ me level .
So the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory does help expla@@ in why se@@ x is so good .
"Now in the mi@@ ddle of all this five sen@@ ses work , I sud@@ den@@ ly re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed the sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed clo@@ cks project from my y@@ outh ."
And I realized this the@@ ory also expla@@ ins why Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck is so much better than m@@ ine .
"You see , my clo@@ ck only fo@@ c@@ uses on si@@ ght , and a little bit of tou@@ ch ."
Here &apos;s Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck .
It &apos;s the first clo@@ ck ever that uses s@@ me@@ ll to tell the time .
"In fact , in terms of the five sen@@ ses , Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck is a re@@ v@@ olution ."
And that &apos;s what this the@@ ory t@@ au@@ ght me about my fie@@ ld .
"You see , up ti@@ ll now , us desig@@ n@@ ers , we &apos;ve ma@@ in@@ ly fo@@ c@@ used on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of tou@@ ch , which means we &apos;ve ig@@ no@@ red the other three sen@@ ses ."
Ch@@ ris &apos;s clo@@ ck shows us that even ra@@ is@@ ing just one of those other sen@@ ses can make for a bri@@ lli@@ ant produ@@ ct .
So what if we started using the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory in all of our desig@@ ns ?
Here &apos;s three qui@@ ck ideas I came up with .
"We could call this &quot; &quot; the per@@ f@@ um@@ ator . &quot; &quot; All right , next ."
"So I br@@ us@@ h my te@@ e@@ th t@@ wi@@ ce a day , and what if we had a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h that ta@@ st@@ es like can@@ dy , and when the ta@@ ste of can@@ dy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h ?"
"F@@ in@@ ally , I have a thing for the ke@@ ys on a flu@@ te or a c@@ lar@@ in@@ et ."
"It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you pre@@ ss down on them ."
"Now , I don &apos;t play the flu@@ te or the c@@ lar@@ in@@ et , so I decided to com@@ b@@ ine these ke@@ ys with an instru@@ ment I do play : the tele@@ vision re@@ mot@@ e control ."
"Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll noti@@ ce that the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these produ@@ cts but also the way they look ."
"Now , I realize the five sen@@ ses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting ."
There &apos;s also the six emoti@@ ons and that e@@ lu@@ sive x@@ -@@ fac@@ tor .
Ma@@ ybe that could be the top@@ ic of my next talk .
"U@@ n@@ til then , ple@@ ase have fun using the five sen@@ ses in your own lives and your own desig@@ ns ."
"O@@ h , one last thing before I leave ."
And the best way to do that is with f@@ ree can@@ dy .
You guys ready ?
All right .
( Applause )
"My father was five years old when he lost his father , but by the time I was born , he was already a bus@@ in@@ ess@@ man ."
But it didn &apos;t make a difference to him if his children were going to be a bo@@ y or a girl : they were going to go to school .
So I gu@@ ess I was the lu@@ ck@@ y one .
My mother had 16 pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cies .
"F@@ ro@@ m 16 pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cies , five of us are ali@@ ve ."
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
"D@@ ay to day , I wat@@ ched women being car@@ ried to a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard , or wat@@ ched children going to a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard ."
"A@@ t that time , when I fini@@ shed my high school , I really wanted to be a do@@ ctor ."
I wanted to be a do@@ ctor to help women and children .
"So I comple@@ ted my education , but I wanted to go to uni@@ versity ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a d@@ or@@ mi@@ t@@ ory for girls , so I was ac@@ cep@@ ted in medi@@ cal school , but I could not go there ."
"So as a resul@@ t , my father s@@ ent me to America ."
I came to America .
I comple@@ ted my education .
"W@@ hi@@ le I was comple@@ ting my education , my country was inv@@ ad@@ ed by R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
"And do you know that at the time I was comple@@ ting my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country ."
"There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it ."
My family was in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p .
"So as so@@ on as I comple@@ ted my education , I brought my family to America ."
I wanted them to be sa@@ fe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan .
"D@@ ay after day , when I list@@ en@@ ed to the news , when I fol@@ low@@ ed what was going on with my country , my heart was bre@@ aking up ."
"I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me ."
I had a good job .
I was a prof@@ ess@@ or at a uni@@ versity .
I ear@@ ned good money .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
But I wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back home .
So I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p .
"And when I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p in P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an , there were 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es . 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
"A@@ b@@ out 90 percent of them were women and children . Mo@@ st of the men have been kil@@ led or they were in war . And you know , in the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p ,"
"@@ when I went da@@ y@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day to do a sur@@ v@@ ey , I found things you never could imagine ."
I saw a wido@@ w with five to eight children sitting there and wee@@ ping and not know@@ ing what to do .
"I saw a young woman have no way to go any@@ where , no education , no en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , no place to even live ."
"I saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are sup@@ por@@ ting the family as a 1@@ 0-@@ to@@ -@@ 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year old bo@@ y — being the head of the hou@@ se@@ h@@ old , trying to prote@@ ct their si@@ ster and their mother and their children ."
So it was a very de@@ v@@ ast@@ ating situ@@ ation .
"My heart was be@@ ating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do ."
"A@@ t that moment , we talk about mom@@ entu@@ m ."
"A@@ t that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?"
How could I help these people ?
I am one individu@@ al . What can I do for them ?
"But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life ."
It trans@@ form@@ ed me . It gave me stat@@ us .
It gave me con@@ fi@@ dence . It gave me a car@@ e@@ er .
"It hel@@ ped me to sup@@ port my family , to bring my family to another country , to be sa@@ fe ."
"And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after ."
But do you think it was e@@ asy ?
"No , because at that time , education was ban@@ ned for girls , completely ."
"And also , by R@@ us@@ si@@ a inv@@ ading Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , people were not tru@@ st@@ ing any@@ one ."
"It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o am I ?"
S@@ ome@@ body who comes from the United States .
S@@ ome@@ body who got edu@@ c@@ ated here .
D@@ id they tr@@ ust me ? O@@ f course not .
So I really needed to build the tr@@ ust in this community .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and sur@@ ve@@ yed and looked and looked .
I asked .
"F@@ in@@ ally , I found one man ."
He was 80 years old .
He was a mul@@ la@@ h .
"I went to his t@@ ent in the cam@@ p , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a teach@@ er . &quot;"
"And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; C@@ razy woman , c@@ razy woman , how do you think I can be a teach@@ er ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a teach@@ er . &quot; &quot; F@@ in@@ ally , he ac@@ cep@@ ted my of@@ f@@ er , and once I started a clas@@ s in his com@@ po@@ u@@ nd , the word sp@@ read all over ."
"In a matter of one year , we had 25 scho@@ ols set up , 1@@ 5@@ ,000 children going to school , and it was amazing ."
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
"But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were gi@@ ving teach@@ er tra@@ ining . We were tra@@ ining women &apos;s ri@@ ghts , human ri@@ ghts , de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y , ru@@ le of la@@ w . We were gi@@ ving all kinds of tra@@ ining . And one day , I tell you ,"
"@@ one day I was in the offi@@ ce in P@@ es@@ ha@@ war , P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an ."
"A@@ ll of a sud@@ den , I saw my st@@ af@@ f ru@@ n@@ ning to ro@@ oms and lo@@ c@@ king the do@@ ors and tel@@ ling me , &quot; &quot; R@@ u@@ n away , hi@@ de ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a lea@@ der , what do you do ?"
You &apos;re sc@@ ared . You know it &apos;s d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
You know your life is on the line .
"But as a lea@@ der , you have to h@@ old it together ."
You have to h@@ old it together and show str@@ eng@@ th .
"So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were po@@ ur@@ ing into my offi@@ ce ."
"This is where I live . I live in Ken@@ ya , at the s@@ outh par@@ ts of the Na@@ i@@ robi N@@ ational Par@@ k ."
"Th@@ ose are my d@@ ad &apos;s c@@ ow@@ s at the back , and behind the c@@ ow@@ s , that &apos;s the Na@@ i@@ robi N@@ ational Par@@ k ."
"Na@@ i@@ robi N@@ ational Par@@ k is not f@@ en@@ ced in the s@@ outh wi@@ de@@ ly , which means wi@@ ld animals like ze@@ bra@@ s mi@@ gr@@ ate out of the par@@ k fre@@ ely ."
"So pre@@ d@@ at@@ ors like li@@ ons fol@@ low them , and this is what they do ."
They ki@@ ll our li@@ v@@ est@@ o@@ ck .
"This is one of the c@@ ow@@ s which was kil@@ led at night , and I just wo@@ ke up in the morning and I found it de@@ ad , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bu@@ ll we had ."
"My community , the Ma@@ as@@ a@@ i , we believe that we came from he@@ a@@ ven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we val@@ ue them so much ."
So I gre@@ w up h@@ ating li@@ ons so much .
"The mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who prote@@ ct our community and the li@@ v@@ est@@ o@@ ck , and they &apos;re also up@@ set about this problem ."
So they ki@@ ll the li@@ ons .
It &apos;s one of the six li@@ ons which were kil@@ led in Na@@ i@@ robi .
And I think this is why the Na@@ i@@ robi N@@ ational Par@@ k li@@ ons are few .
"So a bo@@ y , from six to n@@ ine years old , in my community is respon@@ si@@ ble for his d@@ ad &apos;s c@@ ow@@ s , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me ."
So I had to find a way of sol@@ ving this problem .
"And the first idea I got was to use fi@@ re , because I thought li@@ ons were sc@@ ared of fi@@ re ."
"But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even hel@@ ping the li@@ ons to see through the c@@ ow@@ shed ."
So I didn &apos;t give up . I contin@@ u@@ ed .
And a second idea I got was to use a sc@@ are@@ cro@@ w .
I was trying to tri@@ ck the li@@ ons &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing ne@@ ar the c@@ ow@@ shed .
"But li@@ ons are very cle@@ ver . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the sc@@ are@@ cro@@ w , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he j@@ um@@ ps in and kil@@ ls the animals ."
"So one night , I was wal@@ king around the c@@ ow@@ shed with a tor@@ ch , and that day , the li@@ ons didn &apos;t come ."
And I disco@@ vered that li@@ ons are af@@ ra@@ id of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
"S@@ in@@ ce I was a small bo@@ y , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took a@@ part my mo@@ m &apos;s new radi@@ o , and that day she almost kil@@ led me , but I learned a lot about ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car bat@@ tery , an indi@@ cat@@ or box . It &apos;s a small de@@ vice found in a mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle , and it hel@@ ps mot@@ or@@ ist@@ s when they want to turn right or left . It b@@ lin@@ ks ."
"And I got a s@@ wit@@ ch where I can s@@ wit@@ ch on the li@@ ghts , on and off ."
And that &apos;s a small tor@@ ch from a bro@@ k@@ en f@@ las@@ h@@ light .
So I set up everything .
"As you can see , the solar pan@@ el char@@ ges the bat@@ tery , and the bat@@ tery sup@@ pl@@ ies the power to the small indi@@ cat@@ or box . I call it a trans@@ form@@ er ."
And the indi@@ cat@@ or box makes the li@@ ghts f@@ las@@ h .
"As you can see , the bu@@ l@@ b@@ s face outside , because that &apos;s where the li@@ ons come from ."
And that &apos;s how it looks to li@@ ons when they come at night .
"The li@@ ghts f@@ las@@ h and tri@@ ck the li@@ ons into thinking I was wal@@ king around the c@@ ow@@ shed , but I was sle@@ e@@ ping in my bed ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks .
"So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never exper@@ ien@@ ced any problem with li@@ ons ."
And my neigh@@ bor@@ ing hom@@ es heard about this idea .
One of them was this grand@@ mother .
"S@@ he had a lot of her animals being kil@@ led by li@@ ons , and she asked me if I could put the li@@ ghts for her ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the li@@ ghts . You can see at the back , those are the li@@ on li@@ ghts ."
"S@@ in@@ ce now , I &apos;ve set up seven hom@@ es around my community , and they &apos;re really working ."
"And my idea is also being used now all over Ken@@ ya for sc@@ aring other pre@@ d@@ at@@ ors like hy@@ en@@ as , le@@ opar@@ ds , and it &apos;s also being used to sc@@ are ele@@ ph@@ an@@ ts away from people &apos;s far@@ ms ."
"Because of this inv@@ en@@ tion , I was lu@@ ck@@ y to get a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best scho@@ ols in Ken@@ ya , B@@ ro@@ ok@@ house Inter@@ national S@@ cho@@ ol , and I &apos;m really exci@@ ted about this ."
My new school now is coming in and hel@@ ping by fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing and cre@@ ating an aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess .
"I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re in@@ stal@@ ling the li@@ ghts to the hom@@ es which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teach@@ ing them how to put them ."
"So one year ago , I was just a bo@@ y in the sa@@ v@@ an@@ na gra@@ s@@ s@@ land her@@ ding my father &apos;s c@@ ow@@ s , and I used to see plan@@ es fl@@ ying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside ."
And here I am today .
I got a ch@@ ance to come by pl@@ ane for my first time for TED .
So my big dre@@ am is to become an air@@ c@@ ra@@ ft engine@@ er and pi@@ lot when I gro@@ w up .
"I used to h@@ ate li@@ ons , but now because my inv@@ en@@ tion is sa@@ ving my father &apos;s c@@ ow@@ s and the li@@ ons , we are able to st@@ ay with the li@@ ons without any con@@ fli@@ ct ."
"A@@ sh@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n . It means in my language , th@@ ank you very much ."

"If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , medi@@ cine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives ."
"A@@ t eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called Ma@@ ya &apos;s I@@ de@@ as , and my n@@ on@@ prof@@ it , Ma@@ ya &apos;s I@@ de@@ as for the P@@ lan@@ et ."
( Laughter ) And I make e@@ co@@ -@@ frien@@ d@@ ly clo@@ thing and ac@@ ces@@ sor@@ ies .
"I &apos;m 1@@ 3 now , and al@@ though I started my business in 200@@ 8 , my arti@@ stic jour@@ ney started way before then ."
"I was gre@@ at@@ ly in@@ flu@@ en@@ ced by art , and I wanted to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate it in everything I did , even my business ."
"I would find different f@@ ab@@ ri@@ cs around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a sc@@ ar@@ f or a h@@ at , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for desig@@ ns ."
"I noti@@ ced when I wor@@ e my cre@@ ations , people would stop me and say , &quot; W@@ ow , that &apos;s really cu@@ te . W@@ here can I get one ? &quot;"
"And I thought , I can start my own business ."
Now I didn &apos;t have any business pl@@ ans at only eight years old .
I only knew I wanted to make pretty cre@@ ations that were sa@@ fe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
"My mo@@ m t@@ au@@ ght me how to se@@ w , and on my back por@@ ch , I would si@@ t and make little he@@ ad@@ b@@ ands out of ri@@ b@@ b@@ on , and I would write down the na@@ mes and the pri@@ ce of each i@@ tem ."
"I started making more i@@ tem@@ s like h@@ ats , sc@@ ar@@ ves and b@@ ag@@ s ."
"S@@ o@@ on , my i@@ tem@@ s began sel@@ ling all over the world , and I had cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers in D@@ en@@ mar@@ k , I@@ tal@@ y , Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , C@@ an@@ ada and more ."
"Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like bran@@ ding and marke@@ ting , sta@@ ying eng@@ aged with my cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers , and seeing what s@@ old the most and the least ."
"S@@ o@@ on , my business really started to take off ."
"Th@@ en one day , F@@ or@@ be@@ s mag@@ az@@ ine cont@@ ac@@ ted me when I was 10 years old ."
( Laughter ) They wanted to fe@@ ature me and my company in their arti@@ cle .
"Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business e@@ co@@ -@@ frien@@ d@@ ly ?"
I &apos;ve had a pas@@ sion for prote@@ cting the environment and its cre@@ at@@ ures since I was little .
My parents t@@ au@@ ght me at an early age about gi@@ ving back and being a good ste@@ ward to the environment .
"I heard about how the dy@@ es in some clo@@ thing or the process of even making the i@@ tem@@ s was har@@ m@@ ful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I disco@@ vered that even after dy@@ e@@ ing has being comple@@ ted , there is a wa@@ ste issue that gi@@ ves a neg@@ ative impac@@ t on the environment ."
"For example , the gr@@ in@@ ding of materi@@ als , or the du@@ m@@ ping of d@@ ried pow@@ der materi@@ als ."
"These ac@@ tions can pol@@ lu@@ te the air , making it to@@ x@@ ic to any@@ one or anything that in@@ hal@@ es it ."
"So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my i@@ tem@@ s had to be e@@ co@@ -@@ frien@@ d@@ ly , and 10 to 20 percent of the pro@@ fi@@ ts I made went to local and global char@@ it@@ ies and environ@@ ment@@ al organiz@@ ations ."
"( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new wa@@ ve of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s that not only see@@ ks to have a suc@@ cess@@ ful business , but also a susta@@ in@@ able future ."
I feel that I can me@@ et the needs of my cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers without com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ing the ability of future gener@@ ations to live in a gre@@ en@@ er tom@@ or@@ row .
"We live in a big , di@@ verse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate to sa@@ ve it ."
But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your he@@ ads about the things that are happening in our world .
"It takes to get it through your hear@@ ts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when mov@@ em@@ ents are sp@@ ar@@ ked ."
"That is when opportuni@@ ties and in@@ no@@ vation are created , and that is why ideas come to life ."
"Th@@ ank you , and pe@@ ace and bl@@ ess@@ ings ."

( Applause )
"You know , one of the inten@@ se ple@@ as@@ ures of tra@@ vel and one of the deli@@ ghts of e@@ th@@ no@@ gra@@ phi@@ c research is the opportunity to live am@@ on@@ g@@ st those who have not for@@ got@@ ten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , tou@@ ch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by ra@@ in , ta@@ ste it in the bi@@ t@@ ter lea@@ ves of plan@@ ts ."

"And of course , we all share the same ad@@ ap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ ves ."
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through ini@@ ti@@ ation ri@@ tes .
"We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of death , so it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t sur@@ pri@@ se us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art ."
"But what &apos;s interesting is the uni@@ qu@@ e c@@ ad@@ ence of the s@@ ong , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the dance in every culture ."
"And whether it is the P@@ en@@ an in the fore@@ sts of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the V@@ o@@ od@@ o@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in Ha@@ it@@ i , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ a@@ i@@ su@@ t des@@ er@@ t of Nor@@ ther@@ n Ken@@ ya , the C@@ ur@@ an@@ der@@ o in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ des , or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ a@@ i in the mi@@ ddle of the S@@ a@@ har@@ a — this is in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally the fel@@ low that I tra@@ ve@@ led into the des@@ er@@ t with a mon@@ th ago — or in@@ de@@ ed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , E@@ ver@@ est , the god@@ d@@ ess mother of the world ."
"A@@ ll of these pe@@ op@@ les te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of or@@ ien@@ ting yourself in the Earth ."
"And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fi@@ ll you with hope ."
"Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tu@@ res of the world make up a we@@ b of spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al life and cul@@ tu@@ ral life that en@@ velo@@ ps the planet , and is as important to the wel@@ l-@@ being of the planet as in@@ de@@ ed is the biologi@@ cal we@@ b of life that you know as a bio@@ sp@@ here ."
"And you might think of this cul@@ tu@@ ral we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here , and you might def@@ ine the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here as being the su@@ m tot@@ al of all thou@@ ghts and dre@@ am@@ s , my@@ ths , ideas , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ations , in@@ tu@@ i@@ tions brought into being by the human imag@@ in@@ ation since the daw@@ n of con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness ."
The e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here is hum@@ ani@@ ty &apos;s great leg@@ acy .
It &apos;s the sym@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qui@@ si@@ tive species .
"And just as the bio@@ sp@@ here has been se@@ ver@@ ely er@@ od@@ ed , so too is the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here — and , if anything , at a far gre@@ ater r@@ ate ."
"No biologi@@ sts , for example , would d@@ are su@@ ggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ in@@ k of ex@@ t@@ in@@ ction because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most apo@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ o in the re@@ al@@ m of biologi@@ cal di@@ versity — sc@@ ar@@ ce@@ ly appro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic scen@@ ari@@ o in the re@@ al@@ m of cul@@ tu@@ ral di@@ versity ."
"And the great indi@@ cat@@ or of that , of course , is language lo@@ ss ."
"When each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages spo@@ k@@ en on the planet ."
"Now , a language is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ lar@@ y or a set of gra@@ m@@ m@@ ati@@ cal ru@@ les ."
A language is a f@@ las@@ h of the human sp@@ ir@@ it .
It &apos;s a ve@@ hi@@ cle through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the materi@@ al world .
"E@@ very language is an ol@@ d-@@ grow@@ th fore@@ st of the mind , a wat@@ er@@ shed , a thought , an e@@ co@@ system of spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies ."
"And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages , as we si@@ t here today in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being whi@@ sp@@ er@@ ed into the ear@@ s of children ."
"They &apos;re no longer being t@@ au@@ ght to b@@ ab@@ ies , which means , effe@@ cti@@ vely , un@@ less something chang@@ es , they &apos;re already de@@ ad ."
"What could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ velo@@ ped in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pas@@ s on the wi@@ s@@ dom of the an@@ c@@ est@@ ors or anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate the pro@@ mi@@ se of the children ?"
"And yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the p@@ light of somebody some@@ where on Earth rou@@ gh@@ ly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der d@@ ies and car@@ r@@ ies with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ les of an an@@ cient ton@@ gu@@ e ."
"And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spo@@ ke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at , let &apos;s make that language Y@@ or@@ u@@ ba . Let &apos;s make it C@@ an@@ ton@@ ese ."
Let &apos;s make it K@@ og@@ i . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll sud@@ den@@ ly disco@@ ver what it would be like to be u@@ na@@ ble to speak your own language .
"And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here , a br@@ ie@@ f jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here , to try to beg@@ in to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost ."
"Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being ."
"T@@ ake , for example , this child of a Bar@@ as@@ ana in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally they came up the mi@@ l@@ k ri@@ ver from the e@@ ast in the be@@ lly of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ na@@ k@@ es ."
"Now , this is a people who cogni@@ ti@@ vely do not di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ h the color blue from the color green because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the fore@@ st upo@@ n which the people de@@ p@@ end ."
They have a cu@@ ri@@ ous language and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called &quot; &quot; lin@@ gu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ amy : &quot; &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spe@@ ak@@ s a different language .
"And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cal past , yet the cu@@ ri@@ ous thing is in these long h@@ ous@@ es , where there are six or seven langu@@ ages spo@@ k@@ en because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never hear any@@ one prac@@ ti@@ cing a language ."
They simply list@@ en and then beg@@ in to speak .
"O@@ r , one of the most fas@@ cin@@ ating tri@@ be@@ s I ever li@@ ved with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani of nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ace@@ fully in 19@@ 5@@ 8 ."
"In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , five mis@@ si@@ on@@ ar@@ ies at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted cont@@ act and made a cri@@ tical mist@@ ake ."
"They dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 g@@ lo@@ s@@ sy photograph@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be frien@@ d@@ ly g@@ est@@ ures , for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st had never seen anything two@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal in their lives ."
"They pi@@ cked up these photograph@@ s from the fore@@ st flo@@ or , tr@@ ied to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and con@@ clu@@ ded that these were cal@@ ling car@@ ds from the de@@ vi@@ l , so they spe@@ ared the five mis@@ si@@ on@@ ar@@ ies to death ."
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
They spe@@ ared each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ t@@ ality was du@@ e to them spe@@ aring each other .
"We trac@@ ed gen@@ e@@ al@@ og@@ ies back eight gener@@ ations , and we found two in@@ stan@@ ces of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mi@@ t@@ ted that one of the fel@@ low@@ s had got@@ ten so old that he d@@ ied getting old , so we spe@@ ared him any@@ way . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a per@@ spi@@ c@@ aci@@ ous know@@ le@@ dge of the fore@@ st that was ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing ."
Th@@ e@@ ir hun@@ ters could s@@ me@@ ll ani@@ mal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
"In the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , I had a really ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment when I was asked by my prof@@ ess@@ or at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard if I was interested in going down to Ha@@ it@@ i , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the se@@ cre@@ t socie@@ ties which were the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of D@@ u@@ val@@ ier &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ on@@ ton M@@ ac@@ ou@@ tes , and se@@ cur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ b@@ ies ."
"In order to make sense out of sen@@ s@@ ation , of course , I had to understand something about this re@@ mark@@ able fai@@ th of V@@ od@@ ou@@ n . And V@@ o@@ od@@ o@@ o is not a black mag@@ ic cul@@ t ."
"O@@ n the con@@ tr@@ ary , it &apos;s a comple@@ x me@@ ta@@ physi@@ cal wor@@ l@@ d@@ view ."
It &apos;s interesting .
"If I asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?"
"Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ani@@ ty , Is@@ l@@ am , Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ sm , Ju@@ da@@ is@@ m , whatever ."
"There &apos;s always one contin@@ ent left out , the as@@ sum@@ ption being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa had no religi@@ ous belie@@ f@@ s . Well , of course , they did and V@@ o@@ od@@ o@@ o is simply the di@@ st@@ il@@ l@@ ation of these very pro@@ found religi@@ ous ideas that came over during the tra@@ gi@@ c D@@ i@@ as@@ por@@ a of the s@@ la@@ very era ."
"But , what makes V@@ o@@ od@@ o@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relation@@ ship between the living and the de@@ ad ."
"So , the living give bir@@ th to the spi@@ ri@@ ts ."
"The spi@@ ri@@ ts can be inv@@ o@@ ked from b@@ ene@@ ath the Gre@@ at W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the dance to mom@@ ent@@ ari@@ ly disp@@ l@@ ace the s@@ ou@@ l of the living , so that for that br@@ ie@@ f sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te be@@ comes the go@@ d ."
That &apos;s why the V@@ o@@ od@@ o@@ o@@ ist@@ s like to say that &quot; &quot; You white people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and speak about God .
"We dance in the tem@@ ple and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed , you are taken by the sp@@ ir@@ it — how can you be har@@ med ?"
"So you see these ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ations : V@@ o@@ od@@ o@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ bers with im@@ pu@@ ni@@ ty , a rather ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the ability of the mind to af@@ fe@@ ct the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ al@@ y@@ zed in the state of extre@@ me exci@@ tation ."
"Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary are the K@@ og@@ i of the S@@ ier@@ ra N@@ ev@@ ada de S@@ an@@ ta Mar@@ ta in nor@@ ther@@ n Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a ."

"In a blo@@ od@@ sta@@ ined contin@@ ent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed by the S@@ p@@ ani@@ sh ."
"To this day , they re@@ ma@@ in ru@@ led by a ri@@ tu@@ al pr@@ ie@@ s@@ th@@ o@@ od but the tra@@ ining for the pr@@ ie@@ s@@ th@@ o@@ od is rather ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ."
"The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their fam@@ il@@ ies at the age of three and four , sequ@@ est@@ er@@ ed in a sha@@ dow@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one hu@@ ts at the b@@ ase of gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ s for 18 years : two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year per@@ i@@ ods deli@@ ber@@ ately cho@@ s@@ en to mi@@ mi@@ c the n@@ ine months of g@@ est@@ ation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ori@@ cally in the wom@@ b of the great mother ."
"And for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ u@@ es of their society , val@@ u@@ es that ma@@ in@@ tain the pro@@ posi@@ tion that their pra@@ y@@ ers and their pra@@ y@@ ers alone ma@@ in@@ tain the co@@ smi@@ c — or we might say the e@@ co@@ logi@@ cal — bal@@ ance ."
"And at the end of this amazing ini@@ ti@@ ation , one day they &apos;re sud@@ den@@ ly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a su@@ n@@ ri@@ se . And in that c@@ r@@ yst@@ al moment of aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess of first light as the Su@@ n begin@@ s to ba@@ the the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly beautiful land@@ s@@ cape , sud@@ den@@ ly everything they have learned in the ab@@ strac@@ t is af@@ fir@@ med in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ ory .

"It is that beautiful . It is y@@ ours to prote@@ ct . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; el@@ der bro@@ thers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the youn@@ ger bro@@ thers , are the ones respon@@ si@@ ble for de@@ stro@@ ying the world ."
"Now , this level of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion be@@ comes very important ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and land@@ s@@ cape , we either inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; &quot; no@@ ble sa@@ v@@ age , &quot; &quot; which is an idea rac@@ i@@ st in its sim@@ pli@@ city , or alter@@ n@@ ati@@ vely , we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ ore@@ a@@ u and say these people are clo@@ s@@ er to the Earth than we are ."
"Well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther sen@@ ti@@ ment@@ al no@@ r we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a ."
"There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al s@@ wa@@ m@@ ps of the A@@ s@@ m@@ at or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of Ti@@ be@@ t , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , through time and ri@@ tu@@ al , for@@ g@@ ed a tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal m@@ yst@@ i@@ qu@@ e of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion : the idea that the Earth itself can only exi@@ st because it is bre@@ a@@ the@@ d into being by human con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness ."
"Now , what does that mean ?"
It means that a young kid from the An@@ des who &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that m@@ oun@@ tain is an Ap@@ u sp@@ ir@@ it that will dire@@ ct his or her de@@ st@@ iny will be a prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly different human being and have a different relation@@ ship to that re@@ source or that place than a young kid from M@@ on@@ t@@ ana ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a m@@ oun@@ tain is a pi@@ le of ro@@ ck ready to be min@@ ed .
W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s the ab@@ od@@ e of a sp@@ ir@@ it or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or that de@@ fin@@ es the relation@@ ship between the individu@@ al and the natural world .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the fore@@ sts of Bri@@ ti@@ sh Col@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those fore@@ sts ex@@ ist@@ ed to be cut .
"That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ g@@ st the K@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those fore@@ sts were the ab@@ od@@ e of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked Be@@ ak of H@@ e@@ a@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ ri@@ ts that dw@@ el@@ led at the nor@@ th end of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts they would have to eng@@ age during their H@@ am@@ at@@ sa ini@@ ti@@ ation ."
"Now , if you beg@@ in to look at the idea that these cul@@ tu@@ res could create different reali@@ ties , you could beg@@ in to understand some of their ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary disco@@ ver@@ ies . T@@ ake this pl@@ ant here ."
It &apos;s a photogra@@ ph I took in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last Ap@@ ri@@ l .
"This is a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ ac@@ tive pre@@ par@@ ation of the sha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re ."
"What makes a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fas@@ cin@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ ologi@@ cal poten@@ tial of this pre@@ par@@ ation , but the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this wo@@ ody li@@ ana which has in it a ser@@ ies of be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ m@@ ine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mi@@ l@@ d@@ ly hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ og@@ eni@@ c — to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue ha@@ zy smo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness — but it &apos;s mi@@ x@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the co@@ f@@ fe@@ e family called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is ."
"This pl@@ ant had in it some very powerful tr@@ y@@ p@@ tam@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ tam@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ meth@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ tam@@ ine ."
"If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami b@@ low@@ ing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ ses , that sub@@ stance they make from a different set of species also con@@ ta@@ ins meth@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ tam@@ ine ."
To have that pow@@ der b@@ low@@ n up your no@@ se is rather like being sh@@ ot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with ba@@ ro@@ qu@@ e pain@@ t@@ ings and lan@@ ding on a se@@ a of electri@@ city . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of re@@ ality ; it cre@@ ates the dis@@ solution of re@@ ality .

They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ j@@ un@@ ction with some other chemi@@ cal that den@@ at@@ ures the M@@ A@@ O .

So I started plan@@ ning how to help them es@@ cape .
I was so sur@@ pri@@ sed that a tot@@ al str@@ ang@@ er car@@ ed enough to ask .
I realized that this was a sym@@ bo@@ li@@ c moment in my life .
( Music ) ( Applause )
This is a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten we desig@@ ned in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten to be a cir@@ cle .
It &apos;s a kind of en@@ d@@ less cir@@ cul@@ ation on top of the ro@@ of .
"If you are a par@@ ent , you know that kids love to keep making cir@@ cles ."
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we design this ?
"The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al of this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a hand@@ ra@@ il . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ si@@ st@@ ed : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sti@@ c@@ king out from the ed@@ ge of the ro@@ of ?"
"So that it can cat@@ ch the children fal@@ ling off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government offi@@ cial said , &quot; O@@ f course you have to have a hand@@ ra@@ il . &quot;"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es po@@ pping through .
And we were allow@@ ed to call this rop@@ e as a hand@@ ra@@ il .
"But of course , rop@@ e has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times 40 children are around a t@@ ree .
"The bo@@ y on the bran@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the t@@ ree so he is e@@ ating the t@@ ree ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they si@@ t on the ed@@ ge ."
It looks so nice from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys in the z@@ o@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ e@@ ding time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g wa@@ sh@@ ing place — there are many kinds of water ta@@ ps .
"You see with the f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble tu@@ be@@ s , you want to spra@@ y water to your friends , and the show@@ er , and the one in front is quite nor@@ mal ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not wa@@ sh@@ ing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s pu@@ tting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this archite@@ cture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms .
So there is no ac@@ ou@@ stic bar@@ r@@ ier at all .
"When you put many children in a qu@@ ie@@ t box , some of them get really ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ v@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary .
"And the prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to st@@ ay in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back ev@@ en@@ tually , because it &apos;s a cir@@ cle , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of oc@@ ca@@ sion , usu@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ d@@ ly , we consi@@ der no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children sle@@ ep better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t sle@@ ep in a qu@@ ie@@ t space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , these children show amazing con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation in clas@@ s ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the j@@ un@@ g@@ le with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not sup@@ posed to be in sil@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control ."
"You know , it &apos;s completely open ."
In sum@@ m@@ er you go s@@ wi@@ m@@ ming .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
"And also , you should know that you are wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of ."
You never me@@ l@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are sup@@ posed to be outside ."
So that is how we should tre@@ at them .
This is how they di@@ vi@@ de clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms .
They are sup@@ posed to help teach@@ ers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A clas@@ s@@ room .
And a wa@@ sh@@ basi@@ n .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the clas@@ s@@ room .
A mon@@ key trying to fish another mon@@ key from ab@@ o@@ ve .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each clas@@ s@@ room has at least one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ an@@ ta C@@ l@@ au@@ s comes down at the time of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ sha@@ ped kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten ."
The building is only five me@@ ters t@@ all with seven flo@@ ors .
"And of course , the ce@@ il@@ ing he@@ ight is very low ."
So you have to consi@@ der sa@@ fe@@ ty .
"So , we put our children , a d@@ aughter and a son ."
They tr@@ ied to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s o@@ kay . H@@ is sku@@ ll is quite stron@@ g .
He is re@@ sil@@ ien@@ t . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to j@@ um@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The traf@@ fic j@@ am is aw@@ ful in T@@ ok@@ y@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in front , she needs to learn how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now these days , kids need a small do@@ s@@ age of d@@ ang@@ er ."
"Now , this d@@ raw@@ ing is show@@ ing the movement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
And the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ fer@@ ence of this building is 1@@ 8@@ 3 me@@ ters .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 me@@ ters in the morning ."
But the sur@@ pri@@ se is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 me@@ ters on a@@ ver@@ age ."
And these children have the high@@ est a@@ th@@ le@@ tic abi@@ lit@@ ies am@@ ong many kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ s .
"The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
J@@ ust like sh@@ e@@ ep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep ru@@ n@@ ning . ( Laughter )
"My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t prote@@ ct them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble sometimes ."
They need to get some in@@ j@@ ury .
"I think archite@@ cture is cap@@ able of chang@@ ing this world , and people &apos;s lives ."
And this is one of the at@@ tem@@ p@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .

Here are some images of clu@@ st@@ ers of gal@@ ax@@ ies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
"They are these huge colle@@ ctions of gal@@ ax@@ ies , b@@ ound together by their mu@@ tu@@ al gra@@ vity ."
"So most of the poin@@ ts that you see on the scre@@ en are not individu@@ al star@@ s , but colle@@ ctions of star@@ s , or gal@@ ax@@ ies ."
"Now , by show@@ ing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are these beautiful obje@@ cts , but more than that , I think gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are m@@ yst@@ eri@@ ous , they are sur@@ pri@@ sing , and they &apos;re us@@ e@@ ful ."
U@@ se@@ ful as the universe &apos;s most mas@@ sive labor@@ at@@ or@@ ies .
"And as labor@@ at@@ or@@ ies , to descri@@ be gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers is to descri@@ be the experim@@ ents that you can do with them ."
"And I think there are four major typ@@ es , and the first ty@@ pe that I want to descri@@ be is prob@@ ing the very big ."
"So , how big ?"
"Well , here is an image of a particular gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ ster ."
"It is so mas@@ sive that the light pas@@ sing through it is being b@@ ent , it &apos;s being di@@ stor@@ ted by the extre@@ me gra@@ vity of this clu@@ ster ."
"And , in fact , if you look very car@@ e@@ fully you &apos;ll be able to see r@@ ings around this clu@@ ster ."
"Now , to give you a number , this particular gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ ster has a mas@@ s of over one million billion su@@ ns ."
It &apos;s just min@@ d-@@ bog@@ gl@@ ing how mas@@ sive these systems can get .
"But more than their mas@@ s , they have this ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal fe@@ ature ."
"They are essen@@ ti@@ ally is@@ ol@@ ated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a sc@@ ale@@ d-@@ down ver@@ sion of the entire universe ."
"And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large sc@@ al@@ es , such as , how does gra@@ vity work ?"
might be ans@@ wer@@ ed by stu@@ dy@@ ing these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very ho@@ t .
"O@@ kay , if I take an image of a gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ ster , and I sub@@ trac@@ t away all of the star@@ light , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blue blo@@ b ."
This is in fal@@ se color .
It &apos;s actually X@@ -@@ ra@@ y light that we &apos;re seeing .
"And the question is , if it &apos;s not gal@@ ax@@ ies , what is e@@ mi@@ tting this light ?"
"The answer is ho@@ t gas , mi@@ lli@@ on-@@ de@@ gre@@ e gas — in fact , it &apos;s pl@@ as@@ ma ."
And the reason why it &apos;s so ho@@ t goes back to the pre@@ vi@@ ous sli@@ de .
"The extre@@ me gra@@ vity of these systems is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating parti@@ cles of gas to great spe@@ eds , and great spe@@ eds means great temper@@ at@@ ures ."
"So this is the ma@@ in idea , but science is a rou@@ gh dra@@ ft ."
"There are many basi@@ c pro@@ per@@ ties about this pl@@ as@@ ma that still con@@ f@@ use us , still pu@@ z@@ z@@ le us , and still p@@ us@@ h our under@@ standing of the physi@@ cs of the very ho@@ t ."
Th@@ ird thing : prob@@ ing the very small .
"Now , to expla@@ in this , I need to tell you a very di@@ st@@ urb@@ ing fact ."
Mo@@ st of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of at@@ oms .
You were lie@@ d to .
"Mo@@ st of it is made up of something very , very m@@ yst@@ eri@@ ous , which we call dar@@ k matter ."
"D@@ ar@@ k matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to inter@@ act very much , ex@@ cept through gra@@ vity , and of course we would like to learn more about it ."
"If you &apos;re a parti@@ cle physi@@ ci@@ st , you want to know what happens when we s@@ mas@@ h things together ."
And dar@@ k matter is no ex@@ cep@@ tion .
"Well , how do we do this ?"
"To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers col@@ li@@ de ?"
Here is an image .
"S@@ in@@ ce gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative sli@@ ces of the universe , sc@@ ale@@ d-@@ down ver@@ sions ."
"They are mo@@ st@@ ly made up of dar@@ k matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this blu@@ is@@ h pur@@ ple ."
"The red re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts the ho@@ t gas , and , of course , you can see many gal@@ ax@@ ies ."
"What &apos;s happened is a parti@@ cle ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ator at a huge , huge scale ."
"And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effe@@ cts that might be difficult to de@@ te@@ ct in the la@@ b , might be com@@ po@@ un@@ ded and com@@ po@@ un@@ ded into something that we could possi@@ bly obser@@ ve in nature ."
"So , it &apos;s very fun@@ ny ."
"The reason why gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers can te@@ ach us about dar@@ k matter , the reason why gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers can te@@ ach us about the physi@@ cs of the very small , is pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly because they are so very big ."
F@@ our@@ th thing : the physi@@ cs of the very str@@ ange .
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly what I &apos;ve said so far is c@@ razy .
"O@@ kay , if there &apos;s anything str@@ ang@@ er I think it has to be dar@@ k energy ."
"If I th@@ row a ball into the air , I expe@@ ct it to go up ."
What I don &apos;t expe@@ ct is that it go up at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing r@@ ate .
"S@@ imi@@ lar@@ ly , co@@ smo@@ logi@@ sts understand why the universe is ex@@ pan@@ ding ."
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s ex@@ pan@@ ding at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing r@@ ate .
"They give the cause of this ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated ex@@ pan@@ sion a name , and they call it dar@@ k energy ."
"And , again , we want to learn more about it ."
"So , one particular question that we have is , how does dar@@ k energy af@@ fe@@ ct the universe at the largest sc@@ al@@ es ?"
"D@@ e@@ pen@@ ding on how stron@@ g it is , maybe structure form@@ s f@@ ast@@ er or s@@ low@@ er ."
"Well , the problem with the lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ bly comp@@ lic@@ ated ."
Here is a computer si@@ mul@@ ation .
And we need a way to sim@@ pli@@ fy it .
"Well , I like to think about this using an an@@ al@@ og@@ y ."
"If I want to understand the sin@@ king of the T@@ it@@ ani@@ c , the most important thing to do is not to model the little posi@@ tions of every single little piece of the boat that bro@@ ke off ."
The most important thing to do is to tr@@ ack the two bi@@ ggest par@@ ts .
"S@@ imi@@ lar@@ ly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest sc@@ al@@ es by trac@@ king its bi@@ ggest pie@@ ces and those bi@@ ggest pie@@ ces are clu@@ st@@ ers of gal@@ ax@@ ies ."
"So , as I come to a close , you might feel sli@@ gh@@ tly che@@ ated ."
"I mean , I began by talking about how gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ st@@ ers are us@@ e@@ ful , and I &apos;ve given some reas@@ ons , but what is their use really ?"
"Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quot@@ e by H@@ en@@ ry F@@ or@@ d when he was asked about cars ."
"He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said f@@ ast@@ er hor@@ ses . &quot; &quot; T@@ od@@ ay , we as a society are fac@@ ed with many , many difficult problems ."
And the solu@@ tions to these problems are not obvi@@ ous .
They are not f@@ ast@@ er hor@@ ses .
They will requi@@ re an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of scienti@@ fic ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity .
"So , y@@ es , we need to fo@@ cus , y@@ es , we need to con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate , but we also need to remember that in@@ no@@ vation , ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation — these things come when we bro@@ a@@ den our fie@@ ld of vision when we ste@@ p back when we z@@ o@@ om out ."
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by stu@@ dy@@ ing the universe around us . Th@@ an@@ ks .

"A@@ t the time , I was car@@ di@@ ologi@@ st at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , speci@@ aliz@@ ing in car@@ di@@ a@@ c imag@@ ing techni@@ qu@@ es ."
The call came from a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an at the L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Z@@ o@@ o .
A@@ n el@@ der@@ ly fe@@ m@@ ale ch@@ im@@ pan@@ ze@@ e had wok@@ en up with a fac@@ i@@ al dro@@ o@@ p and the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were wor@@ ried that she &apos;d had a stro@@ ke .
They asked if I &apos;d come to the z@@ o@@ o and image the ani@@ mal &apos;s heart to look for a possible car@@ di@@ a@@ c cause .
"Now , to be clear , Nor@@ th American z@@ o@@ os are st@@ af@@ f@@ ed by high@@ ly qu@@ ali@@ f@@ ied , bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ f@@ ied ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans who take out@@ standing care of their ani@@ mal patients ."
"But oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally , they do re@@ ach into the human medi@@ cal community , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly for some speci@@ ality con@@ sul@@ tation , and I was one of the lu@@ ck@@ y physi@@ ci@@ ans who was in@@ vi@@ ted in to help ."
"And this pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re , which I have done on many human patients , was iden@@ tical , with the ex@@ cep@@ tion of that pa@@ w and that ta@@ il ."
"Now most of the time , I was working at U@@ C@@ L@@ A Me@@ di@@ cal C@@ enter with physi@@ ci@@ ans , di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s and di@@ ag@@ no@@ ses and tre@@ at@@ ments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Z@@ o@@ o with ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans , di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s and di@@ ag@@ no@@ ses and tre@@ at@@ ments for their ani@@ mal patients ."
"And oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally , on the very same day , I went on ro@@ un@@ ds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A Me@@ di@@ cal C@@ enter and at the L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Z@@ o@@ o ."
And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear fo@@ cus for me .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans and ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were essen@@ ti@@ ally taking care of the same di@@ sor@@ ders in their ani@@ mal and human patients : con@@ g@@ esti@@ ve heart fai@@ lu@@ re , brain tu@@ mor@@ s , le@@ u@@ ke@@ mi@@ a , di@@ a@@ be@@ tes , ar@@ th@@ ri@@ t@@ is , A@@ L@@ S , bre@@ ast can@@ cer , even psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c syn@@ dro@@ mes like de@@ pres@@ sion , an@@ x@@ ie@@ ty , com@@ pul@@ sions , e@@ ating di@@ sor@@ ders and self-@@ in@@ j@@ ury ."
"Now , I &apos;ve got a con@@ f@@ es@@ sion to make ."
"E@@ ven though I stud@@ ied com@@ par@@ ative physi@@ o@@ logy and ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary bio@@ logy as an under@@ gra@@ d — I had even wri@@ t@@ ten my s@@ eni@@ or the@@ sis on D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ an the@@ ory — lear@@ ning about the sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant over@@ la@@ p between the di@@ sor@@ ders of animals and hum@@ ans , it came as a much needed wa@@ ke@@ -@@ up call for me ."
"So I started wonder@@ ing , with all of these over@@ la@@ ps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an , or con@@ sul@@ t the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary liter@@ ature , for in@@ si@@ ghts into one of my human patients ?"
"Wh@@ y had I never , no@@ r had any of my physi@@ ci@@ an friends and colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es wh@@ om I asked , ever at@@ ten@@ ded a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary con@@ fer@@ ence ?"
"For that matter , why was any of this a sur@@ pri@@ se ?"
"I mean , look , every single physi@@ ci@@ an ac@@ cep@@ ts some biologi@@ cal conne@@ ction between animals and hum@@ ans ."
E@@ very medi@@ cation that we pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ be or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our fam@@ il@@ ies has first been test@@ ed on an ani@@ mal .
"Now , maybe some of the sur@@ pri@@ se comes from the incre@@ as@@ ing se@@ par@@ ation in our world between the urb@@ an and the n@@ on@@ urb@@ an ."
"You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wo@@ ol grow@@ s on tre@@ es or that che@@ ese comes from a pl@@ ant ."
"Well , today &apos;s human ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly , are tur@@ ning into these g@@ le@@ am@@ ing ca@@ the@@ d@@ r@@ als of technology ."
But I think there &apos;s an even de@@ e@@ per reason .
"But in our hear@@ ts , we don &apos;t completely believe that ."
I feel it myself when I &apos;m list@@ ening to Mo@@ zar@@ t or looking at pi@@ ctures of the Mars R@@ over on my M@@ ac@@ B@@ ook .
"I feel that tu@@ g of human ex@@ cep@@ tion@@ ali@@ sm , even as I re@@ cogni@@ ze the scienti@@ fi@@ cally is@@ ol@@ ating cost of seeing ourselves as a super@@ i@@ or species , a@@ part ."
"Well , I &apos;m trying these days ."
"When I see a human patien@@ t now , I always ask , what do the ani@@ mal do@@ ct@@ ors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?"
"And , might I be taking better care of my human patien@@ t if I saw them as a human ani@@ mal patien@@ t ?"
Here are a few exam@@ ples of the kind of exci@@ ting conne@@ ctions that this kind of thinking has led me to .
F@@ ear@@ -@@ indu@@ ced heart fai@@ lu@@ re .
"A@@ round the year 2@@ 000 , human car@@ di@@ ologi@@ sts &quot; &quot; disco@@ vered &quot; &quot; emoti@@ on@@ ally indu@@ ced heart fai@@ lu@@ re ."
"But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human di@@ ag@@ no@@ sis was ne@@ i@@ ther new , no@@ r was it uni@@ qu@@ ely human ."
"@@ V@@ e@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans had been di@@ ag@@ no@@ sing , tre@@ ating and even pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing emoti@@ on@@ ally indu@@ ced sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s in animals r@@ ang@@ ing from mon@@ ke@@ ys to fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , from to de@@ er to ra@@ b@@ bi@@ ts , since the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
S@@ el@@ f-@@ in@@ j@@ ury .
S@@ ome human patients har@@ m themselves .
"S@@ ome p@@ lu@@ ck out pat@@ ch@@ es of ha@@ ir , others actually cut themselves ."
S@@ ome ani@@ mal patients also har@@ m themselves .
There are bir@@ ds that p@@ lu@@ ck out fe@@ a@@ thers .
There are stal@@ li@@ ons that re@@ pe@@ ti@@ ti@@ vely bi@@ te their f@@ lan@@ ks until they b@@ le@@ ed .
But ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have very speci@@ fic and very effe@@ ctive ways of tre@@ ating and even pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing self-@@ in@@ j@@ ury in their self-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ ing animals .
S@@ hou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t this ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary know@@ le@@ dge be put into the h@@ ands of psycho@@ ther@@ a@@ pi@@ sts and parents and patients stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with self-@@ in@@ j@@ ury ?
P@@ ost@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pres@@ sion and post@@ par@@ tu@@ m psycho@@ sis .
"S@@ ome@@ times , so@@ on after gi@@ ving bir@@ th , some women become de@@ pres@@ sed , and sometimes they become seri@@ ously de@@ pres@@ sed and even psy@@ ch@@ oti@@ c ."
"They may neg@@ le@@ ct their ne@@ w@@ born , and in some extre@@ me c@@ ases , even har@@ m the child ."
But ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have de@@ vi@@ sed an inter@@ ven@@ tion to deal with this fo@@ al re@@ je@@ ction syn@@ dro@@ me that inv@@ ol@@ ves incre@@ as@@ ing o@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in in the m@@ are .
"O@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in is the b@@ on@@ ding hor@@ m@@ one , and this le@@ ads to ren@@ ew@@ ed inter@@ est , on the part of the m@@ are , in her fo@@ al ."
S@@ hou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t this information be put into the h@@ ands of o@@ b / g@@ y@@ n &apos;s and family do@@ ct@@ ors and patients who are stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with post@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pres@@ sion and psycho@@ sis ?
"Well , des@@ pi@@ te all of this pro@@ mi@@ se , un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely the gu@@ l@@ f between our fie@@ l@@ ds re@@ ma@@ ins large ."
"To expla@@ in it , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;m going to have to air some di@@ r@@ ty la@@ un@@ d@@ ry ."
S@@ ome physi@@ ci@@ ans can be real s@@ no@@ b@@ s about do@@ ct@@ ors who are not M@@ .@@ D@@ . &apos; s .
"I &apos;m talking about den@@ ti@@ sts and op@@ t@@ ome@@ tri@@ sts and psycho@@ logi@@ sts , but maybe es@@ pe@@ cially ani@@ mal do@@ ct@@ ors ."
So I don &apos;t bl@@ ame the ve@@ ts for feeling an@@ no@@ yed by my prof@@ es@@ sion &apos;s con@@ des@@ cen@@ sion and ig@@ nor@@ ance .
But here &apos;s one from the ve@@ ts : What do you call a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an who can only take care of one species ?
"A physi@@ ci@@ an .

"A@@ f@@ ter all , we hum@@ ans are animals , too , and it &apos;s time for us physi@@ ci@@ ans to em@@ brac@@ e our patients &apos; and our own ani@@ mal natu@@ res and jo@@ in ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans in a spe@@ cie@@ s@@ -@@ sp@@ an@@ ning appro@@ ach to health ."

Thank you .

C@@ an ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c information make you health@@ y ?
In 200@@ 1 I got h@@ it by a tra@@ in .
My tra@@ in was a heart att@@ ack .
"I found myself in a ho@@ spit@@ al in an inten@@ si@@ ve@@ -@@ care ward , re@@ cu@@ per@@ ating from em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy sur@@ g@@ ery ."
And I sud@@ den@@ ly realized something : that I was completely in the dar@@ k .
"I started as@@ king my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;"
&quot; C@@ ould my do@@ ctor have war@@ ned me ? &quot;
"So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the for@@ mu@@ la for life and good health ."
"G@@ ene@@ ti@@ cs , li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le and environment ."
"That &apos;s going to sort of con@@ tain our ri@@ sk@@ s , and if we man@@ age those ri@@ sk@@ s we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good health@@ y life ."
"Well , I understand the gen@@ e@@ ti@@ cs and li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le part ."
And you know why I understand that ?
Because my physi@@ ci@@ ans con@@ stan@@ tly ask me questions about this .
"H@@ a@@ ve you ever had to fi@@ ll out those long , leg@@ al@@ -@@ size form@@ s in your do@@ ctor &apos;s offi@@ ce ?"
"I mean , if you &apos;re lu@@ ck@@ y enough you get to do it more than once , right ?"
"( Laughter ) Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your li@@ fe@@ sty@@ le and your family history , your medi@@ cation history , your sur@@ gi@@ cal history , your al@@ l@@ er@@ gy history ... did I for@@ get any history ?"
"But this part of the equ@@ ation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physi@@ ci@@ ans really get this part of the equ@@ ation ."
"What does that mean , my environment ?"
"Well , it can mean a lot of things ."
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
W@@ hi@@ le I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you li@@ ved ?
"J@@ ust think about that , you know , wan@@ der through your life thinking about this ."
And you realize that you spend it in a v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of different places .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
"And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an air@@ pl@@ ane a good por@@ tion of your time tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing some place ."
"So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody as@@ ks you , &quot; &quot; W@@ here do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?"
"And where do you ex@@ pos@@ e your@@ selves to ri@@ sk@@ s that maybe per@@ haps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the con@@ clu@@ sion that I spend about 7@@ 5 percent of my time relati@@ vely in a small number of places ."
"And I don &apos;t wan@@ der far from that place for a maj@@ ori@@ ty of my time , even though I &apos;m an ex@@ ten@@ sive global tre@@ k@@ k@@ er ."
"Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little jour@@ ney here ."
"I started off in S@@ c@@ ran@@ ton , P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania ."
"I don &apos;t know if any@@ body might ha@@ il from nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , but this is where I spent my first 1@@ 9 years with my little young lu@@ n@@ gs ."
"You know , bre@@ a@@ thing high con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ations here of sul@@ fu@@ r di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de , car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de and meth@@ ane gas , in u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al qu@@ anti@@ ties — 1@@ 9 years of this ."
"And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those pi@@ les of bur@@ ning , smo@@ l@@ der@@ ing co@@ al wa@@ ste look like ."
"So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mi@@ d-@@ w@@ est ."
"O@@ K , so I en@@ ded up in L@@ ou@@ is@@ vi@@ l@@ le , Ken@@ tu@@ ck@@ y ."
"Well , I decided to be neigh@@ b@@ ors to a place called R@@ u@@ b@@ ber@@ tow@@ n ."
They man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture pla@@ sti@@ cs . They use large qu@@ anti@@ ties ch@@ lo@@ rop@@ ren@@ e and b@@ en@@ z@@ ene .
"O@@ kay , I spent 25 years , in my mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ age lu@@ n@@ gs now , bre@@ a@@ thing v@@ ari@@ ous con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ations of that ."
"And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it ."
It was in@@ si@@ di@@ ous and it was really happening .
"Th@@ en I decided I had to get really s@@ mar@@ t , I would take this job in the W@@ est Co@@ ast ."
And I mo@@ ved to R@@ ed@@ l@@ ands C@@ alifor@@ nia .
"@@ V@@ ery nice , and there my ol@@ der , s@@ eni@@ or lu@@ n@@ gs , as I like to call them , I fil@@ led with parti@@ cul@@ ate matter , car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de and very high do@@ ses of oz@@ one ."
O@@ kay ? Al@@ most like the high@@ est in the n@@ ation .
"A@@ l@@ right , this is what it looks like on a good day ."
"If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about ."
"So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?"
"Well , the picture is , there is a huge ga@@ p here ."
The one thing that never happens in my do@@ ctor &apos;s offi@@ ce : They never ask me about my place history .
"No do@@ ctor , can I remember , ever as@@ king me , &quot; W@@ here have you li@@ ved ? &quot;"
They ha@@ ven &apos;t asked me what kind of the qu@@ ality of the d@@ r@@ in@@ king water that I put in my m@@ outh or the food that I ing@@ est into my st@@ om@@ ach .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s mis@@ sing .
L@@ ook at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend bi@@ llions of dollars inv@@ est@@ ing in this kind of research .
"Now , I &apos;ve cir@@ c@@ led the places where I &apos;ve been ."
"Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart att@@ ack I &apos;d been in the right places . R@@ ight ?"
"So , how many people are in the white ?"
How many people in the room have spent the maj@@ ori@@ ty of their life in the white space ?
An@@ y@@ body ? Bo@@ y you &apos;re lu@@ ck@@ y .
How many have spent it in the red places ?
"O@@ h , not so lu@@ ck@@ y ."
There are thousands of these kinds of ma@@ ps that are disp@@ la@@ yed in at@@ las@@ es all over the world .
They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our tra@@ in w@@ re@@ ck .
But n@@ one of that &apos;s in my medi@@ cal recor@@ d .
And it &apos;s not in y@@ ours either .
"So , here &apos;s my friend P@@ au@@ l ."
"He &apos;s a colle@@ ag@@ ue . He allow@@ ed his cell phone to be trac@@ ked every two hours , 2@@ 4 / 7 , 3@@ 6@@ 5 days out of the year for the last two years , every@@ where he went ."
And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
And this is where he has spent most of his time .
If you really stud@@ ied that you might have some clu@@ es as to what P@@ au@@ l li@@ k@@ es to do .
An@@ y@@ body got any clu@@ es ? S@@ ki . R@@ ight .
"We can z@@ o@@ om in here , and we sud@@ den@@ ly see that now we see where P@@ au@@ l has really spent a maj@@ ori@@ ty of his time ."
And all of those black d@@ ots are all of the to@@ x@@ ic rele@@ ase inv@@ ent@@ or@@ ies that are mon@@ i@@ to@@ red by the E@@ P@@ A .
D@@ id you know that data ex@@ ist@@ ed ?
"For every community in the United States , you could have your own per@@ son@@ aliz@@ ed ma@@ p of that ."
"So , our cell ph@@ ones can now build a place history ."
This is how P@@ au@@ l did it . He did it with his i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
This might be what we end up with .
This is what the physi@@ ci@@ an would have in front of him and her when we enter that ex@@ am room instead of just the p@@ in@@ k sli@@ p that said I pa@@ id at the coun@@ ter . R@@ ight ?
This could be my little as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment .
"And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a Bi@@ ll , I su@@ ggest that maybe you not deci@@ de , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful C@@ alifor@@ nia , and it &apos;s war@@ m every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck at night ."
"I &apos;d su@@ ggest that that &apos;s a bad idea Bi@@ ll , because of this re@@ port . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tions ."
"O@@ kay , number one is , we must te@@ ach physi@@ ci@@ ans about the val@@ ue of ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal information ."
It &apos;s called ge@@ ome@@ di@@ cine . There are about a half a do@@ z@@ en progra@@ ms in the world right now that are fo@@ c@@ used on this .
And they &apos;re in the early st@@ ages of develo@@ pment .
"These progra@@ ms need to be sup@@ por@@ ted , and we need to te@@ ach our future do@@ ct@@ ors of the world the import@@ ance of some of the information I &apos;ve sh@@ ared here with you today ."
"The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re sp@@ ending bi@@ llions and bi@@ llions of dollars all over the world building an ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic health recor@@ d , we make sure we put a place history inside that medi@@ cal recor@@ d ."
It not only will be important for the physi@@ ci@@ an ; it will be important for the resear@@ ch@@ ers that now will have huge sam@@ ples to dra@@ w upo@@ n .
But it will also be us@@ e@@ ful for us .
"I could have made the deci@@ sion , if I had this information , not to move to the oz@@ one ca@@ pi@@ tal of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that deci@@ sion ."
O@@ r I could neg@@ oti@@ ate with my em@@ plo@@ y@@ er to make that deci@@ sion in the best inter@@ est of myself and my company .
"Wi@@ th that , I would like to just say that J@@ ack L@@ or@@ d said this almost 10 years ago ."
J@@ ust look at that for a minu@@ te .
"That was what the con@@ clu@@ sion of the D@@ ar@@ t@@ m@@ outh At@@ l@@ as of H@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ care was about , was saying that we can expla@@ in the ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c v@@ ari@@ ations that oc@@ cu@@ r in dise@@ ase , in il@@ l@@ ness , in wel@@ l@@ ness , and how our health@@ care system actually oper@@ ates ."
That was what he was talking about on that quot@@ e .
And I would say he got it right almost a dec@@ ade ago .
"So , I &apos;d very much like to see us beg@@ in to really se@@ i@@ ze this as an opportunity to get this into our medi@@ cal recor@@ ds ."
"So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : G@@ e@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y always mat@@ ters ."
And I believe that ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c information can make both you and me very health@@ y . Thank you .

"So I was tra@@ ined to become a g@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ st for two years in H@@ u@@ na@@ n , China in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
"When I was in the first gra@@ de , the government wanted to trans@@ f@@ er me to a school for a@@ th@@ le@@ tes , all ex@@ pen@@ ses pa@@ id ."
"But my ti@@ ger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engine@@ er like them ."
"A@@ f@@ ter survi@@ ving the C@@ ul@@ tu@@ ral R@@ ev@@ olution , they fir@@ m@@ ly belie@@ ved there &apos;s only one sure way to happ@@ iness : a sa@@ fe and wel@@ l-@@ pa@@ id job ."
It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dre@@ am was to become a Chin@@ ese op@@ era sing@@ er .
That is me playing my imag@@ in@@ ary pi@@ ano .
"A@@ n op@@ era sing@@ er must start tra@@ ining young to learn ac@@ rob@@ ati@@ cs , so I tr@@ ied everything I could to go to op@@ era school ."
I even wro@@ te to the school prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al and the ho@@ st of a radi@@ o show .
But no ad@@ ul@@ ts li@@ ked the idea .
No ad@@ ul@@ ts belie@@ ved I was seri@@ ous .
"O@@ n@@ ly my friends sup@@ por@@ ted me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was ."
"So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be tra@@ ined ."
My dre@@ am would never come true .
I was af@@ ra@@ id that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s happ@@ iness would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so un@@ fa@@ ir .
So I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to find another cal@@ ling .
N@@ ob@@ ody around to te@@ ach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to boo@@ ks .
I s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied my hun@@ ger for par@@ ent@@ al ad@@ vice from this book by a family of wri@@ ters and musi@@ ci@@ ans . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ or@@ respon@@ dence in the F@@ ami@@ ly of F@@ ou Le@@ i &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my ro@@ le model of an in@@ depen@@ dent woman when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an tra@@ di@@ tion requi@@ res obe@@ d@@ ience . &#91; &quot; &quot; J@@ ane E@@ y@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be ef@@ fi@@ cient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er by the D@@ oz@@ en &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspi@@ red to study ab@@ ro@@ ad after re@@ ading these .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ om@@ ple@@ te Wor@@ ks of S@@ an@@ ma@@ o &quot; &quot; ( ak@@ a E@@ ch@@ o Ch@@ an ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ ess@@ ons F@@ ro@@ m Hi@@ story &quot; &quot; by N@@ an H@@ u@@ a@@ i@@ j@@ in &#93; I came to the U.@@ S. in 199@@ 5 , so which boo@@ ks did I read here first ?"
"B@@ o@@ o@@ ks ban@@ ned in China , of course ."
&quot; &quot; The Go@@ od Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chin@@ ese pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not con@@ ven@@ ien@@ t for pro@@ p@@ ag@@ an@@ da . G@@ ot it .
"The Bi@@ ble is interesting , but str@@ ange ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a top@@ ic for a different day .
But the fi@@ f@@ th comm@@ and@@ ment gave me an epi@@ ph@@ any : &quot; You sh@@ all hon@@ or your father and mother . &quot;
"&quot; &quot; H@@ on@@ or , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obe@@ y . &quot; &quot; So it be@@ comes my to@@ ol to clim@@ b out of this Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an gu@@ il@@ t tra@@ p and to re@@ start my relation@@ ship with my parents ."
En@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing a new culture also started my ha@@ bit of com@@ par@@ ative re@@ ading .
It of@@ f@@ ers many in@@ si@@ ghts .
"For example , I found this ma@@ p out of place at first because this is what Chin@@ ese students gre@@ w up with ."
"It had never oc@@ cur@@ red to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the cen@@ ter of the world ."
A ma@@ p actually car@@ r@@ ies somebody &apos;s view .
C@@ om@@ par@@ ative re@@ ading actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a stan@@ d@@ ard prac@@ ti@@ ce in the ac@@ a@@ demi@@ c world .
There are even research fie@@ l@@ ds such as com@@ par@@ ative religi@@ on and com@@ par@@ ative liter@@ ature .
C@@ om@@ p@@ are and con@@ tra@@ st gi@@ ves sch@@ ol@@ ars a more comple@@ te under@@ standing of a top@@ ic .
"So I thought , well , if com@@ par@@ ative re@@ ading works for research , why not do it in da@@ i@@ ly life too ?"
So I started re@@ ading boo@@ ks in pa@@ ir@@ s .
"So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in Fran@@ kli@@ n &quot; &quot; by W@@ al@@ ter I@@ sa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Joh@@ n A@@ dam@@ s &quot; &quot; by Davi@@ d M@@ c@@ C@@ ul@@ l@@ ough &#93; — who are inv@@ olved in the same ev@@ ent , or friends with sh@@ ared exper@@ ien@@ ces ."

"For the Ch@@ ri@@ st , the tem@@ p@@ t@@ ations are economic , poli@@ tical and spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al ."
"For the Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ a , they are all psycho@@ logi@@ cal : l@@ ust , fe@@ ar and social du@@ ty — interesting ."
"So if you know a fore@@ ig@@ n language , it &apos;s also fun to read your fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te boo@@ ks in two langu@@ ages ."

&quot; &quot; Bri@@ de &quot; &quot; in Chin@@ ese liter@@ ally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; U@@ h@@ -@@ oh .
( Laughter ) Bo@@ o@@ ks have given me a mag@@ ic port@@ al to conne@@ ct with people of the past and the present .
I know I sh@@ all never feel lon@@ ely or power@@ less again .
Ha@@ ving a dre@@ am sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed really is nothing com@@ par@@ ed to what many others have su@@ f@@ fer@@ ed .
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only pur@@ pos@@ e of a dre@@ am .
"I@@ ts most important pur@@ pos@@ e is to get us in tou@@ ch with where dre@@ am@@ s come from , where pas@@ sion comes from , where happ@@ iness comes from ."
E@@ ven a sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed dre@@ am can do that for you .
"So because of boo@@ ks , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a pur@@ pos@@ e and a c@@ lar@@ ity , most of the time ."
So may boo@@ ks be always with you .
Thank you .

"I &apos;m an American , which means , gener@@ ally , I ig@@ nor@@ e fo@@ ot@@ ball un@@ less it inv@@ ol@@ ves guys my size or B@@ ru@@ no &apos;s size ru@@ n@@ ning into each other at extre@@ me@@ ly high spe@@ eds ."
"That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ig@@ nor@@ e fo@@ ot@@ ball for the last couple of weeks ."
"I go on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , there are all these str@@ ange words that I &apos;ve never heard before : F@@ I@@ F@@ A , v@@ u@@ v@@ u@@ z@@ el@@ a , we@@ ird jo@@ k@@ es about o@@ ct@@ op@@ i ."
"But the one that &apos;s really been sort of stre@@ s@@ sing me out , that I ha@@ ven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve gone on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter in the last couple of weeks , you &apos;ve probably seen this ."
It &apos;s been a major tr@@ ending top@@ ic .
"Be@@ ing a mon@@ ol@@ in@@ gu@@ al American , I obvi@@ ously don &apos;t know what the ph@@ ra@@ se means ."
"So I went on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , and I asked some people if they could expla@@ in to me &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , my B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ an friends were more than ready to help ."
"They expla@@ ined that the G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o bir@@ d is a r@@ are and en@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed par@@ ro@@ t that &apos;s in terri@@ ble , terri@@ ble d@@ ang@@ er ."
"In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it ."
"N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : A word about G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o , a very r@@ are kind of bir@@ d n@@ ative to B@@ raz@@ il ."
"E@@ very year , more than 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o bir@@ ds are kil@@ led during C@@ ar@@ ni@@ v@@ al par@@ a@@ des ."
"E@@ than Z@@ u@@ ck@@ er@@ man : O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , this is a tra@@ gi@@ c situ@@ ation , and it actually gets wor@@ se ."
"It turns out that , not only is the G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o par@@ ro@@ t very at@@ trac@@ tive , us@@ e@@ ful for he@@ ad@@ dre@@ s@@ ses , it evi@@ d@@ ently has certain hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ og@@ eni@@ c pro@@ per@@ ties , which means that there &apos;s a terri@@ ble problem with G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o ab@@ use ."
S@@ ome si@@ ck and t@@ wi@@ st@@ ed people have found themselves s@@ nor@@ ting G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o .
And it &apos;s terri@@ bly en@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed .
"The good news about this is that the global community — again , my B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ an friends tell me — is pit@@ ching in to help out ."
"It turns out that L@@ ady G@@ ag@@ a has rele@@ as@@ ed a new single — actually five or six new sing@@ les , as ne@@ ar as I can tell — ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And my B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ an friends tell me that if I just t@@ we@@ et the ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o , &quot; &quot; 10 c@@ ents will be given to a global cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to sa@@ ve this r@@ are and beautiful bir@@ d ."
"Now , most of you have figu@@ red out that this was a p@@ ran@@ k , and actually a very , very good one ."
"&quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o &quot; &quot; actually means something very different ."
"In P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ ese , it means &quot; &quot; S@@ hu@@ t your m@@ outh , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And it speci@@ fi@@ cally ref@@ ers to this guy , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o Bu@@ en@@ o , who &apos;s the le@@ ad so@@ c@@ cer com@@ ment@@ ator for Re@@ de G@@ lo@@ bo ."
And what I understand from my B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ an friends is that this guy is just a cli@@ ch@@ e mach@@ ine .
He can ru@@ in the most interesting mat@@ ch by just spo@@ u@@ ting cli@@ ch@@ e again and again and again .
"So B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ ans went to that first mat@@ ch against Nor@@ th Kore@@ a , put up this ban@@ ner , started a T@@ wit@@ ter cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n and tr@@ ied to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce the rest of us to t@@ we@@ et the ph@@ ra@@ se : &quot; &quot; C@@ ala a bo@@ ca , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so suc@@ cess@@ ful at this that it top@@ ped T@@ wit@@ ter for two weeks ."
Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of l@@ ess@@ ons that you can take from this .
"And the first l@@ es@@ son , which I think is a wor@@ th@@ while one , is that you cannot go wrong as@@ king people to be ac@@ tive on@@ line , so long as acti@@ vi@@ sm just means re@@ t@@ wee@@ ting a ph@@ ra@@ se ."
"So as long as acti@@ vi@@ sm is that simple , it &apos;s pretty e@@ asy to get away with ."
"The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ ans on T@@ wit@@ ter ."
There &apos;s more than five million of them .
"As far as national re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation , 11 percent of B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ an inter@@ net us@@ ers are on T@@ wit@@ ter ."
That &apos;s a much high@@ er number than in the U.@@ S. or U.@@ K@@ .
"N@@ ex@@ t to J@@ ap@@ an , it &apos;s the second most re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted by popul@@ ation ."
"Now if you &apos;re using T@@ wit@@ ter or other social net@@ works , and you didn &apos;t realize this was a space with a lot of B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ ans in it , you &apos;re like most of us ."
Because what happens on a social network is you inter@@ act with the people that you have cho@@ s@@ en to inter@@ act with .
"And if you are like me , a big , ge@@ ek@@ y , white , American guy , you ten@@ d to inter@@ act with a lot of other ge@@ ek@@ y , white , American guys ."
And you don &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly have the sense that T@@ wit@@ ter is in fact a very he@@ avi@@ ly B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ an space .
"It &apos;s also extre@@ me@@ ly sur@@ pri@@ sing to many Ameri@@ cans , a he@@ avi@@ ly Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American space ."
T@@ wit@@ ter re@@ cent@@ ly did some research .
They looked at their local popul@@ ation .
They believe that 2@@ 4 percent of American T@@ wit@@ ter us@@ ers are Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American .
That &apos;s about t@@ wi@@ ce as high as Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Ameri@@ cans are re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted in the popul@@ ation .
"And again , that was very sh@@ oc@@ king to many T@@ wit@@ ter us@@ ers , but it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be ."
And the reason it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into T@@ ren@@ ding T@@ op@@ i@@ cs .
And you ten@@ d to find top@@ i@@ cs that are almost enti@@ re@@ ly Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American convers@@ ations .
"This was a vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ ation done by F@@ er@@ n@@ an@@ do V@@ ie@@ gas and Mar@@ t@@ in W@@ at@@ ten@@ ber@@ g , two amazing vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ ation desig@@ n@@ ers , who looked at a we@@ ek@@ end &apos;s wor@@ th of T@@ wit@@ ter traf@@ fic and essen@@ ti@@ ally found that a lot of these tr@@ ending top@@ i@@ cs were basically se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated convers@@ ations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expe@@ ct ."
"It turns out that oil spi@@ ll is a mo@@ st@@ ly white convers@@ ation , that co@@ ok@@ out is a mo@@ st@@ ly black convers@@ ation ."
"And what &apos;s c@@ razy about this is that if you wanted to mi@@ x up who you were seeing on T@@ wit@@ ter , it &apos;s liter@@ ally a qui@@ ck cli@@ ck away ."
"You cli@@ ck on that co@@ ok@@ out ta@@ g , there an enti@@ re@@ ly different convers@@ ation with different people parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ing in it ."
"But gener@@ ally spe@@ aking , most of us don &apos;t ."
"We end up within these fil@@ ter bu@@ b@@ b@@ les , as my friend E@@ li Par@@ is@@ er cal@@ ls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are si@@ mi@@ lar to the people we already know ."
And we ten@@ d not to see that wi@@ der picture .
"Now for me , I &apos;m sur@@ pri@@ sed by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the inter@@ net was sup@@ posed to be ."
"If you go back into the early days of the inter@@ net , when cy@@ ber@@ -@@ ut@@ op@@ i@@ ans like Ni@@ ck Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te were writing big boo@@ ks like &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing D@@ i@@ gi@@ tal , &quot; &quot; the pre@@ di@@ ction was that the inter@@ net was going to be an incredi@@ bly powerful force to smo@@ ot@@ h out cul@@ tu@@ ral differ@@ ences , to put us all on a common fie@@ ld of one fas@@ hi@@ on or another ."
Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te started his book with a story about how hard it is to build conne@@ ctions in the world of at@@ oms .
He &apos;s at a technology con@@ fer@@ ence in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da .
"And he &apos;s looking at something really , tru@@ ly ab@@ sur@@ d , which is bot@@ t@@ les of E@@ vi@@ an water on the table ."
And Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te says this is c@@ razy .
This is the old econom@@ y .
"It &apos;s the econom@@ y of moving these he@@ av@@ y , s@@ low at@@ oms over long di@@ stan@@ ces that &apos;s very difficult to do ."
"We &apos;re he@@ ading to the future of bi@@ ts , where everything is spe@@ e@@ dy , it &apos;s we@@ igh@@ t@@ less ."
It can be any@@ where in the world at any time .
And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
"Now , Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te has been right about a lot of things ."
He &apos;s tot@@ ally wrong about this one .
It turns out that in many c@@ ases at@@ oms are much more mo@@ bi@@ le than bi@@ ts .
"If I walk into a stor@@ e in the United States , it &apos;s very , very e@@ asy for me to bu@@ y water that &apos;s bot@@ t@@ led in F@@ i@@ ji , shi@@ pped at great ex@@ pen@@ se to the United States ."
It &apos;s actually sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly hard for me to see a F@@ i@@ j@@ i@@ an fe@@ ature film .
It &apos;s really difficult for me to list@@ en to F@@ i@@ j@@ i@@ an music .
"It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly difficult for me to get F@@ i@@ j@@ i@@ an news , which is str@@ ange , because actually there &apos;s an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount going on in F@@ i@@ ji ."
There &apos;s a cou@@ p government . There &apos;s a mi@@ lit@@ ary government .
There &apos;s c@@ rac@@ k@@ dow@@ ns on the pre@@ ss .
It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be pa@@ ying at@@ ten@@ tion to at the moment .
Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
I think that we ten@@ d to look a lot at the in@@ fra@@ structure of glob@@ aliz@@ ation .
We look at the fra@@ me@@ work that makes it possible to live in this conne@@ cted world .
And that &apos;s a fra@@ me@@ work that inclu@@ des things like air@@ line rou@@ tes .
It inclu@@ des things like the Inter@@ net c@@ ab@@ les .
"We look at a ma@@ p like this one , and it looks like the entire world is f@@ lat because everything is a ho@@ p or two away ."
"You can get on a f@@ light in Lon@@ don , you can end up in B@@ ang@@ al@@ ore later today ."
"T@@ wo hop@@ s , you &apos;re in Su@@ v@@ a , the ca@@ pi@@ to@@ l of F@@ i@@ ji ."
It &apos;s all right there .
"When you start looking at what actually f@@ low@@ s on top of these net@@ works , you get a very different picture ."
"You start looking at how the global pl@@ ane fli@@ ghts move , and you sud@@ den@@ ly disco@@ ver that the world isn &apos;t even close to f@@ lat ."
It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly lu@@ m@@ py .
"There are par@@ ts of the world that are very , very well conne@@ cted ."
There &apos;s basically a gi@@ ant pa@@ th@@ way in the sk@@ y between Lon@@ don and New York .
"@@ but look at this ma@@ p , and you can wat@@ ch this for , you know , two or three minutes ."
You won &apos;t see very many plan@@ es go from S@@ outh America to Africa .
And you &apos;ll disco@@ ver that there are par@@ ts of the g@@ lo@@ be that are system@@ ati@@ cally cut off .
"When we stop looking at the in@@ fra@@ structure that makes conne@@ ction possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realiz@@ ing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does ."
So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last dec@@ ade or so .
"The world is , in fact , getting more global ."
It &apos;s getting more conne@@ cted .
M@@ ore of problems are global in scale .
M@@ ore of our econ@@ omi@@ cs is global in scale .
And our media is less global by the day .
"If you wat@@ ched a tele@@ vision bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast in the United States in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , 3@@ 5 to 40 percent of it would have been inter@@ national news on a ni@@ gh@@ tly new bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast ."
That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
And this ten@@ ds to give us a very di@@ stor@@ ted view of the world .
Here &apos;s a sli@@ de that A@@ li@@ sa M@@ il@@ ler show@@ ed at a pre@@ vi@@ ous TED T@@ al@@ k .
A@@ li@@ sa &apos;s the pre@@ si@@ dent of P@@ u@@ bli@@ c R@@ ad@@ i@@ o Inter@@ national .
"And she made a car@@ to@@ gra@@ m , which is basically a di@@ stor@@ ted ma@@ p based on what American tele@@ vision news ca@@ sts looked at for a mon@@ th ."
"And you see that when you di@@ stor@@ t a ma@@ p based on at@@ ten@@ tion , the world within American tele@@ vision news is basically redu@@ ced to this gi@@ ant blo@@ ated U.@@ S@@ ."
and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed .
And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
"And before you con@@ clu@@ de that this is just a fun@@ ction of American T@@ V news — which is dre@@ ad@@ ful , and I ag@@ ree that it &apos;s dre@@ ad@@ ful — I &apos;ve been ma@@ pping e@@ li@@ te media like the New York T@@ im@@ es , and I get the same thing ."
"When you look at the New York T@@ im@@ es , you look at other e@@ li@@ te media , what you lar@@ ge@@ ly get are pi@@ ctures of very we@@ al@@ th@@ y n@@ ations and the n@@ ations we &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed ."
It turns out that new media isn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly hel@@ ping us all that much .
Here &apos;s a ma@@ p made by Mar@@ k G@@ ra@@ ha@@ m who &apos;s down the stre@@ et at the O@@ x@@ for@@ d Inter@@ net In@@ stitu@@ te .
A this is a ma@@ p of arti@@ cles in Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a that have been ge@@ o@@ -@@ c@@ od@@ ed .
And you &apos;ll noti@@ ce that there &apos;s a very he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as towar@@ ds Nor@@ th America and W@@ est@@ er@@ n Europ@@ e .
"E@@ ven within Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ as , where we &apos;re cre@@ ating their own cont@@ ent on@@ line , there &apos;s a he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as towar@@ ds the place where a lot of the Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a au@@ th@@ ors are based , rather than to the rest of the world ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , you can get up , you can pi@@ ck up your computer when you get out of this s@@ es@@ sion , you could read a ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er from Indi@@ a or from Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a , from C@@ an@@ ada , God for@@ bi@@ d from the U.@@ S@@ ."
You probably won &apos;t .
"If you look at on@@ line media con@@ sum@@ ption — in this case , in the top 10 us@@ ers of the inter@@ net — more than 9@@ 5 percent of the news re@@ ad@@ er@@ ship is on dom@@ esti@@ c news si@@ tes ."
"It &apos;s one of these r@@ are c@@ ases where the U.@@ S. is actually sli@@ gh@@ tly better than &#91; the U.@@ K@@ . &#93; , because we actually like re@@ ading your media , rather than vice ver@@ sa ."
So all of this star@@ ts le@@ ading me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I ref@@ er to as imag@@ in@@ ary co@@ smo@@ po@@ lit@@ ani@@ sm .
We look at the inter@@ net .
We think we &apos;re getting this wi@@ de view of the g@@ lo@@ be .
"We oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally st@@ um@@ ble on@@ to a p@@ age in Chin@@ ese , and we deci@@ de that we do in fact have the gre@@ at@@ est technology ever built to conne@@ ct us to the rest of the world ."
And we for@@ get that most of the time we &apos;re che@@ c@@ king B@@ ost@@ on R@@ ed S@@ o@@ x s@@ co@@ res .
"So this is a real problem — not just because the R@@ ed S@@ o@@ x are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to sol@@ ve are global in scale and sc@@ op@@ e , they requi@@ re global convers@@ ations to get to global solu@@ tions ."
This is a problem we have to sol@@ ve .
So here &apos;s the good news .
"For six years , I &apos;ve been h@@ ang@@ ing out with these guys ."
This is a group called G@@ lob@@ al V@@ o@@ i@@ ces .
This is a team of blo@@ gg@@ ers from around the world .
O@@ ur mis@@ sion was to fi@@ x the world &apos;s media .
We started in 200@@ 4 .
"You might have noti@@ ced , we ha@@ ven &apos;t done all that well so far ."
"N@@ or do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to sol@@ ve the problem ."
"But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting l@@ ess@@ ons for how we would re@@ wi@@ re if we we wanted to use the we@@ b to have a wi@@ der world ."
The first thing you have to consi@@ der is that there are par@@ ts of the world that are dar@@ k spo@@ ts in terms of at@@ ten@@ tion .
In this case — the ma@@ p of the world at night by N@@ A@@ SA — they &apos;re dar@@ k liter@@ ally because of l@@ ack of electri@@ city .
And I used to think that a dar@@ k spo@@ t on this ma@@ p basically me@@ ant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more basi@@ c needs .
"What I &apos;m star@@ ting to realize is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of work , and you need an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement ."
"One of those dar@@ k spo@@ ts is M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ car , a country which is gener@@ ally better known for the D@@ re@@ am@@ works film than it is actually known for the lo@@ vely people who live there ."
And so the people who f@@ oun@@ ded F@@ o@@ ko C@@ lub in M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ car wer@@ en &apos;t actually con@@ cer@@ ned with trying to change the image of their country .
They were doing something much sim@@ ple@@ r .
It was a c@@ lub to learn En@@ g@@ li@@ sh and to learn compu@@ ters and the inter@@ net .
but what happened was that M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ car went through a viol@@ ent cou@@ p .
Mo@@ st in@@ depen@@ dent media was sh@@ u@@ t down .
"And the high school students who were lear@@ ning to blo@@ g through F@@ o@@ ko C@@ lub sud@@ den@@ ly found themselves talking to an inter@@ national audience about the de@@ mon@@ str@@ ations , the violence , everything that was going on within this country ."
"So a very , very small program desig@@ ned to get people in front of compu@@ ters , publi@@ sh@@ ing their own thou@@ ghts , publi@@ sh@@ ing in@@ depen@@ dent media , en@@ ded up having a huge impac@@ t on what we know about this country ."
Now the tri@@ ck with this is that I &apos;m gu@@ ess@@ ing most people here don &apos;t speak M@@ al@@ ag@@ asy .
"I &apos;m also gu@@ ess@@ ing that most of you don &apos;t even speak Chin@@ ese — which is sort of sa@@ d if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted language on the inter@@ net ."
F@@ or@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely people are trying to figure out how to fi@@ x this .
"If you &apos;re using Go@@ og@@ le Ch@@ ro@@ me and you go to a Chin@@ ese language site , you noti@@ ce this really cu@@ te box at the top , which au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally de@@ te@@ cts that the p@@ age is in Chin@@ ese and very quickly at a m@@ ou@@ se cli@@ ck will give you a trans@@ l@@ ation of the p@@ age ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , it &apos;s a mach@@ ine trans@@ l@@ ation of the p@@ age ."
"And while Go@@ og@@ le is very , very good with some langu@@ ages , it &apos;s actually pretty dre@@ ad@@ ful with Chin@@ ese ."
And the resul@@ ts can be pretty fun@@ ny .
"What you really want — what I really want , is ev@@ en@@ tually the ability to p@@ us@@ h a bu@@ t@@ ton and have this qu@@ e@@ u@@ ed so a human being can trans@@ l@@ ate this ."
"And if you think this is ab@@ sur@@ d , it &apos;s not ."
There &apos;s a group right now in China called Ye@@ ey@@ an .
"And Ye@@ ey@@ an is a group of 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers who get on@@ line every day ."
They look for the most interesting cont@@ ent in the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh language .
"They trans@@ l@@ ate rou@@ gh@@ ly 100 arti@@ cles a day from major ne@@ wsp@@ a@@ per@@ s , major we@@ b@@ si@@ tes ."
They put it on@@ line for f@@ ree .
"It &apos;s the project of a guy na@@ med Z@@ h@@ an@@ g Le@@ i , who was living in the United States during the L@@ ha@@ sa ri@@ ots and who couldn &apos;t believe how bi@@ as@@ ed American media co@@ ver@@ age was ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start trans@@ lat@@ ing , so that people between these countries start under@@ standing each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Ye@@ ey@@ an can line up 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 people to trans@@ l@@ ate the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh inter@@ net into Chin@@ ese , where &apos;s the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh language Ye@@ ey@@ an ?"
"Wh@@ o &apos;s going after Chin@@ ese , which now has 4@@ 00 million inter@@ net us@@ ers out there ?"
My gu@@ ess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
"So even if we can find a way to trans@@ l@@ ate from Chin@@ ese , there &apos;s no gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e that we &apos;re going to find it ."
"When we look for information on@@ line , we basically have two strate@@ g@@ ies ."
We use a lot of sear@@ ch .
And sear@@ ch is terri@@ fic if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
"But if what you &apos;re looking for is ser@@ en@@ di@@ pi@@ ty , if you want to st@@ um@@ ble on@@ to something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our ma@@ in phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y is to look to our social net@@ works , to look for our friends ."
What are they looking at ? Ma@@ ybe we should be looking at it .
The problem with this is that essen@@ ti@@ ally what you end up getting after a while is the wi@@ s@@ dom of the flo@@ ck .
"You end up flo@@ c@@ king with a lot of people who are probably si@@ mi@@ lar to you , who have si@@ mi@@ lar interest@@ s ."
"And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other flo@@ cks , from the other par@@ ts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interest@@ s ."
"To do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bu@@ m@@ p you out of your flo@@ ck and into another flo@@ ck ."
You need a gu@@ i@@ de .
So this is A@@ mi@@ ra A@@ l H@@ us@@ sa@@ in@@ i . She is the Mi@@ ddle E@@ ast e@@ di@@ tor for G@@ lob@@ al V@@ o@@ i@@ ces .
She has one of the har@@ d@@ est j@@ ob@@ s in the world .
"N@@ ot only does she have to keep our Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li and P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ an con@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ ors from kil@@ ling each other , she has to figure out what is going to inter@@ est you about the Mi@@ ddle E@@ ast ."
"And in that sense of trying to get you out of your nor@@ mal or@@ bit , and to try to get you to pay at@@ ten@@ tion to a story about someone who &apos;s given up smo@@ king for the mon@@ th of R@@ am@@ ad@@ an , she has to know something about a global audience ."
She has to know something about what stories are available .
"B@@ a@@ si@@ cally , she &apos;s a de@@ e@@ j@@ ay ."
"S@@ he &apos;s a sk@@ il@@ led human cu@@ rat@@ or who know@@ s what materi@@ al is available to her , who &apos;s able to list@@ en to the audience , and who &apos;s able to make a se@@ le@@ ction and p@@ us@@ h people forward in one fas@@ hi@@ on or another ."
I don &apos;t think this is ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mi@@ c process .
I think what &apos;s great about the inter@@ net is that it actually makes it much e@@ as@@ ier for de@@ e@@ ja@@ ys to re@@ ach a wi@@ der audience .
I know A@@ mi@@ ra .
I can ask her what to read .
"But with the inter@@ net , she &apos;s in a posi@@ tion where she can tell a lot of people what to read ."
"And you can list@@ en to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your we@@ b wi@@ den@@ ed ."
"So once you start wi@@ den@@ ing like this , once you start li@@ gh@@ ting up vo@@ i@@ ces in the dar@@ k spo@@ ts , once you start trans@@ lat@@ ing , once you start cur@@ ating , you end up in some really we@@ ird places ."
"This is an image from pretty much my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te blo@@ g , which is Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get ."
And Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get is a blo@@ g that looks at technology in an Africa con@@ te@@ xt .
"And speci@@ fi@@ cally , it &apos;s looking at a bl@@ ac@@ k@@ smi@@ th in K@@ i@@ b@@ era in Na@@ i@@ robi , who is tur@@ ning the sha@@ ft of a L@@ an@@ dro@@ ver into a c@@ old chi@@ se@@ l ."
"And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I con@@ cei@@ v@@ ably care about this ? &quot;"
"And the tru@@ th is , this guy can probably expla@@ in this to you ."
This is E@@ ri@@ k H@@ er@@ s@@ man . You guys may have seen him around the con@@ fer@@ ence .
He goes by the mon@@ i@@ k@@ er W@@ hi@@ te Afri@@ can .
"He &apos;s both a very well known American ge@@ ek , but he &apos;s also Ken@@ y@@ an ; he was born in S@@ ud@@ an , gre@@ w up in Ken@@ ya ."
He is a bri@@ dge figure .
"He is someone who liter@@ ally has fe@@ et in both wor@@ l@@ ds — one in the world of the Afri@@ can technology community , one in the world of the American technology community ."
"And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this bl@@ ac@@ k@@ smi@@ th in K@@ i@@ b@@ era and turn it into a story about re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ing technology , about in@@ no@@ v@@ ating from con@@ stra@@ int , about looking for in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation based on re@@ using materi@@ als ."
"He know@@ s one world , and he &apos;s fin@@ ding a way to communi@@ cate it to another world , both of which he has de@@ ep conne@@ ctions to ."
"These bri@@ dge figu@@ res , I &apos;m pretty well con@@ v@@ in@@ ced , are the future of how we try to make the world wi@@ der through using the we@@ b ."
"But the tri@@ ck with bri@@ d@@ ges is , ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , you need someone to c@@ ross them ."
And that &apos;s where we start talking about x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ les .
"So if I found myself in the N@@ F@@ L , I s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct I would spend my of@@ f-@@ se@@ as@@ on n@@ ur@@ sing my w@@ oun@@ ds , en@@ jo@@ ying my house , so on and so for@@ th — possi@@ bly recor@@ ding a hi@@ p@@ -@@ ho@@ p al@@ bu@@ m ."
"D@@ h@@ ani J@@ ones , who is the mi@@ ddle lin@@ e@@ back@@ er for the C@@ in@@ cin@@ nat@@ i B@@ eng@@ als , has a sli@@ gh@@ tly different appro@@ ach to the of@@ f-@@ se@@ as@@ on ."
D@@ h@@ ani has a tele@@ vision show .
"It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; D@@ h@@ ani T@@ ac@@ k@@ les the G@@ lo@@ be . &quot; &quot; And every week on this tele@@ vision show , D@@ h@@ ani tra@@ v@@ els to a different n@@ ation of the world ."
He fin@@ ds a local spor@@ ting team .
"He tra@@ ins with them for a week , and he pla@@ ys a mat@@ ch with them ."
And his reason for this is not just that he wan@@ ts to ma@@ ster Mu@@ ay T@@ ha@@ i bo@@ x@@ ing .
"It &apos;s because , for him , spor@@ t is the language that allow@@ s him to en@@ coun@@ ter the full wi@@ d@@ th and won@@ der of the world ."
F@@ or some of us it might be music . F@@ or some of us it might be food .
F@@ or a lot of us it might be liter@@ ature or writing .
But there are all these different techni@@ qu@@ es that al@@ low you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
The go@@ al of my T@@ al@@ k here is not to per@@ su@@ ade the people in this room to em@@ brac@@ e your x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a .
"My gu@@ ess — given that you &apos;re at a con@@ fer@@ ence called TE@@ D@@ G@@ lob@@ al — is that most of you are x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ les , whether or not you use that ter@@ m ."
My challen@@ ge instead is this .
It &apos;s not enough to make the per@@ s@@ onal deci@@ sion that you want a wi@@ der world .
We have to figure out how to re@@ wi@@ re the systems that we have .
We have to fi@@ x our media .
We have to fi@@ x the inter@@ net . We have to fi@@ x our education .
We have to fi@@ x our im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation poli@@ cy .
"We need to look at ways of cre@@ ating ser@@ en@@ di@@ pi@@ ty , of making trans@@ l@@ ation per@@ v@@ a@@ sive , and we need to find ways to em@@ brac@@ e and ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate these bri@@ dge figu@@ res ."
And we need to figure out how to cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ate x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ les .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
( Applause )
"B@@ a@@ si@@ cally , there &apos;s a major demo@@ gra@@ phi@@ c ev@@ ent going on ."
And it may be that pas@@ sing the 50 percent urb@@ an point is an economic ti@@ pping point . So the world now is a ma@@ p of conne@@ cti@@ vity .
It used to be that Par@@ is and Lon@@ don and New York were the largest cities .
What we have now is the end of the ri@@ se of the W@@ est . That &apos;s over .
The ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate num@@ bers are over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
"So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , vi@@ ll@@ ages of the world are em@@ p@@ ty@@ ing out ."
"The question is , why ?"
"And here &apos;s the un@@ ro@@ man@@ tic tru@@ th — and the city air makes you f@@ ree , they said in R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance G@@ er@@ many . So some people go to places like S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i but most go to the squ@@ at@@ ter cities where a@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ cs ru@@ le ."
And these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed by po@@ ver@@ ty .
They &apos;re people getting out of po@@ ver@@ ty as f@@ ast as they can .
"They &apos;re the dom@@ in@@ ant buil@@ ders and to a large ex@@ t@@ ent , the dom@@ in@@ ant desig@@ n@@ ers ."
They have h@@ ome@@ -@@ bre@@ w@@ ed in@@ fra@@ structure and vi@@ br@@ ant urb@@ an life .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ si@@ x@@ th of the G@@ D@@ P in Indi@@ a is coming out of M@@ um@@ ba@@ i .
"They are con@@ stan@@ tly up@@ gra@@ ding , and in a few c@@ ases , the government hel@@ ps ."
E@@ du@@ cation is the ma@@ in ev@@ ent that can happen in cities .
What &apos;s going on in the stre@@ et in M@@ um@@ ba@@ i ?
A@@ l G@@ ore know@@ s . It &apos;s basically everything .
There &apos;s no u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment in squ@@ at@@ ter cities . E@@ very@@ one works .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ si@@ x@@ th of hum@@ ani@@ ty is there . It &apos;s so@@ on going to be more than that .
So here &apos;s the first pun@@ ch line : cities have def@@ used the popul@@ ation b@@ om@@ b .
And here &apos;s the second pun@@ ch line .
That &apos;s the news from dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n . Here it is in perspe@@ ctive .
St@@ ars have sh@@ ined down on ear@@ th &apos;s life for bi@@ llions of years .
Now we &apos;re sh@@ ining right back up .
Thank you .
"The night before I was he@@ ading for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land , I was in@@ vi@@ ted to ho@@ st the fin@@ al of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s G@@ ot T@@ al@@ ent &quot; &quot; show in S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i with the 8@@ 0,000 live audience in the st@@ ad@@ i@@ um ."
G@@ u@@ ess who was the perform@@ ing gu@@ est ?
S@@ us@@ an Bo@@ y@@ le .
"And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to S@@ c@@ ot@@ land the next day . &quot; &quot; She s@@ an@@ g beauti@@ fully , and she even man@@ aged to say a few words in Chin@@ ese : 送@@ 你@@ 葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hel@@ l@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; th@@ ank you , &quot; &quot; that ordin@@ ary stuff ."
It means &quot; &quot; green oni@@ on for f@@ ree . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
"Because it was a line from our Chin@@ ese par@@ al@@ le@@ l S@@ us@@ an Bo@@ y@@ le — a 5@@ 0-@@ some year@@ -@@ old woman , a ve@@ ge@@ table ven@@ d@@ or in S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i , who lo@@ ves sing@@ ing W@@ est@@ er@@ n op@@ era , but she didn &apos;t understand any En@@ g@@ li@@ sh or F@@ ren@@ ch or I@@ t@@ ali@@ an , so she man@@ aged to fi@@ ll in the ly@@ ri@@ cs with ve@@ ge@@ table na@@ mes in Chin@@ ese ."
"( Laughter ) And the last s@@ ent@@ ence of N@@ es@@ su@@ n D@@ or@@ ma that she was sing@@ ing in the st@@ ad@@ i@@ um was &quot; &quot; green oni@@ on for f@@ ree . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; S@@ us@@ an Bo@@ y@@ le was saying that , 8@@ 0,000 live audience s@@ an@@ g together ."
That was h@@ il@@ ari@@ ous .
So I gu@@ ess both S@@ us@@ an Bo@@ y@@ le and this ve@@ ge@@ table ven@@ d@@ or in S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i be@@ lon@@ g@@ ed to o@@ ther@@ ness .
"They were the least expe@@ cted to be suc@@ cess@@ ful in the business called en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , yet their cou@@ ra@@ ge and tal@@ ent brought them through ."
And a show and a pl@@ at@@ form gave them the st@@ age to realize their dre@@ am@@ s .
"Well , being different is not that difficult ."
We are all different from different perspe@@ cti@@ ves .
"But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view ."
You may have the ch@@ ance to make a difference .
"My gener@@ ation has been very for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate to wit@@ ness and parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in the histor@@ ic trans@@ form@@ ation of China that has made so many chang@@ es in the past 20 , 30 years ."
"I remember that in the year of 199@@ 0 , when I was gra@@ du@@ ating from colle@@ ge , I was ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job in the s@@ al@@ es de@@ part@@ ment of the first fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar hot@@ el in Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing , Gre@@ at W@@ all S@@ her@@ at@@ on — it &apos;s still there ."
"So after being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated by this J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese man@@ ag@@ er for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , M@@ is@@ s Y@@ an@@ g , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I sum@@ mon@@ ed my cou@@ ra@@ ge and po@@ ise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you se@@ ll ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a clu@@ e what a s@@ al@@ es de@@ part@@ ment was about in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar hot@@ el ."
That was the first day I set my fo@@ ot in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar hot@@ el .
"A@@ round the same time , I was going through an au@@ di@@ tion — the first ever open au@@ di@@ tion by national tele@@ vision in China — with another thous@@ and colle@@ ge girls ."
"The produ@@ cer told us they were looking for some s@@ we@@ et , in@@ no@@ cent and beautiful fre@@ sh face ."
"So when it was my turn , I sto@@ od up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s per@@ son@@ ali@@ ties on tele@@ vision always have to be beautiful , s@@ we@@ et , in@@ no@@ cent and , you know , sup@@ por@@ tive ?"
Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own vo@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of of@@ f@@ en@@ ded them .
"But actually , they were im@@ pres@@ sed by my words ."
"And so I was in the second round of compe@@ ti@@ tion , and then the third and the f@@ our@@ th ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seven ro@@ un@@ ds of compe@@ ti@@ tion , I was the last one to survi@@ ve it ."
So I was on a national tele@@ vision pri@@ me@@ -@@ time show .
"And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chin@@ ese tele@@ vision that allow@@ ed its h@@ ost@@ s to speak out of their own min@@ ds without re@@ ading an appro@@ ved sc@@ ri@@ pt ."
( Applause ) And my we@@ ek@@ ly audience at that time was between 2@@ 00 to 3@@ 00 million people .
"Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.@@ S. and Col@@ um@@ bi@@ a Uni@@ versity to pur@@ su@@ e my post@@ gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ies , and then started my own media company , which was un@@ thought of during the years that I started my car@@ e@@ er ."
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve inter@@ vie@@ w@@ ed more than a thous@@ and people in the past .
"And sometimes I have young people appro@@ ach@@ ing me say , &quot; &quot; L@@ an , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel pro@@ u@@ d of that ."
But then we are also so for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate to wit@@ ness the trans@@ form@@ ation of the whole country .
I was in Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing &apos;s bi@@ d@@ ding for the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c G@@ am@@ es .
I was re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing the S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i E@@ x@@ po .
I saw China em@@ brac@@ ing the world and vice ver@@ sa .
"But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young gener@@ ation up to ?"
"H@@ ow are they different , and what are the differ@@ ences they are going to make to sha@@ pe the future of China , or at large , the world ?"
So today I want to talk about young people through the pl@@ at@@ form of social media .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?"
"Well this is a girl called G@@ u@@ o Me@@ i@@ me@@ i — 20 years old , beautiful ."
"S@@ he show@@ ed off her ex@@ pen@@ sive b@@ ag@@ s , clo@@ the@@ s and car on her mi@@ c@@ rob@@ lo@@ g , which is the Chin@@ ese ver@@ sion of T@@ wit@@ ter ."
And she c@@ la@@ im@@ ed to be the gener@@ al man@@ ag@@ er of R@@ ed C@@ ross at the C@@ ha@@ m@@ ber of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce .
"S@@ he didn &apos;t realize that she ste@@ pped on a sen@@ si@@ tive ner@@ ve and aro@@ used national questi@@ on@@ ing , almost a tur@@ mo@@ il , against the cre@@ di@@ bility of R@@ ed C@@ ross ."
"The contro@@ vers@@ y was so he@@ ated that the R@@ ed C@@ ross had to open a pre@@ ss con@@ fer@@ ence to c@@ lar@@ i@@ fy it , and the inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ation is going on ."
"So far , as of today , we know that she her@@ self made up that ti@@ tle — probably because she feel@@ s pro@@ u@@ d to be as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with ch@@ ari@@ ty ."
"A@@ ll those ex@@ pen@@ sive i@@ tem@@ s were given to her as gi@@ f@@ ts by her bo@@ y@@ friend , who used to be a bo@@ ard member in a sub@@ di@@ vision of R@@ ed C@@ ross at C@@ ha@@ m@@ ber of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce ."
It &apos;s very comp@@ lic@@ ated to expla@@ in .
"But any@@ way , the public still doesn &apos;t bu@@ y it ."
It is still bo@@ il@@ ing .
"It shows us a gener@@ al mi@@ str@@ ust of government or govern@@ ment@@ -@@ bac@@ ked institu@@ tions , which l@@ ac@@ ked tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy in the past ."
And also it show@@ ed us the power and the impac@@ t of social media as mi@@ c@@ rob@@ lo@@ g .
"M@@ i@@ c@@ rob@@ lo@@ g bo@@ om@@ ed in the year of 20@@ 10 , with visi@@ t@@ ors d@@ ou@@ b@@ led and time spent on it tri@@ p@@ led ."
"S@@ in@@ a@@ .@@ co@@ m , a major news port@@ al , alone has more than 1@@ 40 million mi@@ c@@ rob@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers ."
"O@@ n T@@ en@@ cent , 2@@ 00 million ."
"The most popul@@ ar blo@@ g@@ ger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movie st@@ ar , and she has more than 9@@ .@@ 5 million fol@@ low@@ ers , or f@@ ans ."
"A@@ b@@ out 80 percent of those mi@@ c@@ rob@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers are young people , under 30 years old ."
"And because , as you know , the tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal media is still he@@ avi@@ ly contro@@ l@@ led by the government , social media of@@ f@@ ers an open@@ ing to let the ste@@ am out a little bit ."
"But because you don &apos;t have many other open@@ ings , the he@@ at coming out of this open@@ ing is sometimes very stron@@ g , ac@@ tive and even viol@@ ent ."
"So through mi@@ c@@ rob@@ lo@@ gg@@ ing , we are able to understand Chin@@ ese y@@ outh even better ."
So how are they different ?
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , most of them were born in the 8@@ 0s and 9@@ 0s , under the one@@ -@@ child poli@@ cy ."
"And because of se@@ le@@ cted ab@@ or@@ tion by fam@@ il@@ ies who fa@@ vo@@ red bo@@ ys to girls , now we have en@@ ded up with 30 million more young men than women ."
"That could pos@@ e a poten@@ tial d@@ ang@@ er to the society , but who know@@ s ; we &apos;re in a glob@@ aliz@@ ed world , so they can look for gir@@ l@@ friends from other countries ."
Mo@@ st of them have fa@@ ir@@ ly good education .
The il@@ liter@@ acy r@@ ate in China am@@ ong this gener@@ ation is under one percent .
"In cities , 80 percent of kids go to colle@@ ge ."
"But they are fac@@ ing an ag@@ ing China with a popul@@ ation ab@@ o@@ ve 6@@ 5 years old coming up with se@@ ven@@ -@@ poin@@ t-@@ some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 20@@ 30 ."
"And you know we have the tra@@ di@@ tion that youn@@ ger gener@@ ations sup@@ port the el@@ ders fin@@ an@@ cially , and taking care of them when they &apos;re si@@ ck ."
So it means young cou@@ ples will have to sup@@ port four parents who have a life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy of 7@@ 3 years old .
So making a living is not that e@@ asy for young people .
Col@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ates are not in shor@@ t su@@ pp@@ ly .
"In urb@@ an are@@ as , colle@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ates find the star@@ ting s@@ al@@ ary is about 4@@ 00 U.@@ S. dollars a mon@@ th , while the a@@ ver@@ age r@@ ent is ab@@ o@@ ve $ 500 ."
"So what do they do ? They have to share space — squ@@ e@@ e@@ zed in very li@@ mi@@ ted space to sa@@ ve money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tri@@ be of an@@ ts . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get mar@@ ried and bu@@ y their a@@ part@@ ment , they figu@@ red out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to af@@ for@@ d their first a@@ part@@ ment ."
"That r@@ ati@@ o in America would only cost a couple five years to ear@@ n , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the sk@@ y@@ ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ting real est@@ ate pri@@ ce ."
"A@@ mon@@ g the 2@@ 00 million mi@@ gr@@ ant wor@@ k@@ ers , 60 percent of them are young people ."
They find themselves sort of s@@ and@@ wi@@ ched between the urb@@ an are@@ as and the ru@@ ral are@@ as .
"Mo@@ st of them don &apos;t want to go back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , but they don &apos;t have the sense of be@@ lon@@ g@@ ing ."
"They work for longer hours with less in@@ come , less social wel@@ f@@ are ."
"And they &apos;re more v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able to job lo@@ s@@ ses , sub@@ je@@ ct to in@@ fl@@ ation , ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing lo@@ ans from ban@@ ks , ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of the ren@@ min@@ b@@ i , or dec@@ line of de@@ m@@ and from Europ@@ e or America for the produ@@ cts they produ@@ ce ."
"L@@ ast year , though , an app@@ al@@ ling in@@ ci@@ dent in a s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n O@@ E@@ M man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing com@@ po@@ u@@ nd in China : 1@@ 3 young wor@@ k@@ ers in their l@@ ate te@@ ens and early 20@@ s com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted su@@ i@@ ci@@ de , just one by one like ca@@ using a cont@@ ag@@ i@@ ous dise@@ ase ."
But they d@@ ied because of all different per@@ s@@ onal reas@@ ons .
"But this whole in@@ ci@@ dent aro@@ used a huge out@@ c@@ ry from society about the is@@ ol@@ ation , both physi@@ cal and ment@@ al , of these mi@@ gr@@ ant wor@@ k@@ ers ."
"For those who do re@@ turn back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , they find themselves very wel@@ come lo@@ cally , because with the know@@ le@@ dge , sk@@ il@@ ls and net@@ works they have learned in the cities , with the as@@ si@@ stance of the Inter@@ net , they &apos;re able to create more j@@ ob@@ s , up@@ gra@@ de local agri@@ culture and create new business in the less develo@@ ped market ."
"So for the past few years , the co@@ ast@@ al are@@ as , they found themselves in a shor@@ t@@ age of lab@@ or ."
These di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms show a more gener@@ al social back@@ ground .
"The first one is the En@@ g@@ els co@@ ef@@ fi@@ cient , which expla@@ ins that the cost of da@@ i@@ ly ne@@ ces@@ si@@ ties has dro@@ pped its per@@ cent@@ age all through the past dec@@ ade , in terms of family in@@ come , to about 3@@ 7@@ -@@ some percent ."
"But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 3@@ 9 percent , indi@@ c@@ ating a ri@@ sing living cost ."
The G@@ in@@ i co@@ ef@@ fi@@ cient has already pas@@ sed the d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous line of 0@@ .@@ 4 .
Now it &apos;s 0@@ .@@ 5 — even wor@@ se than that in America — show@@ ing us the in@@ come in@@ equ@@ ality .
And so you see this whole society getting f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated about lo@@ sing some of its mo@@ bility .
"And also , the bi@@ t@@ ter@@ ness and even re@@ s@@ ent@@ ment towar@@ ds the ri@@ ch and the powerful is quite wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ."
So any ac@@ c@@ us@@ ations of cor@@ ru@@ ption or back@@ door de@@ al@@ ings between au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ies or business would aro@@ use a social out@@ c@@ ry or even un@@ rest .
"So through some of the hot@@ test top@@ i@@ cs on mi@@ c@@ rob@@ lo@@ gg@@ ing , we can see what young people care most about ."
S@@ o@@ cial ju@@ sti@@ ce and government ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability ru@@ ns the first in what they de@@ m@@ and .
"For the past dec@@ ade or so , a mas@@ sive urb@@ ani@@ z@@ ation and develo@@ pment have let us wit@@ ness a lot of re@@ por@@ ts on the for@@ ced demo@@ li@@ tion of pri@@ v@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ty ."
And it has aro@@ used huge ang@@ er and f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation am@@ ong our young gener@@ ation .
"S@@ ome@@ times people get kil@@ led , and sometimes people set themselves on fi@@ re to prote@@ st ."
"So when these in@@ ci@@ d@@ ents are re@@ por@@ ted more and more fre@@ qu@@ ently on the Inter@@ net , people c@@ ry for the government to take ac@@ tions to stop this ."
"So the good news is that ear@@ lie@@ r this year , the state coun@@ ci@@ l pas@@ sed a new regu@@ l@@ ation on house requi@@ si@@ tion and demo@@ li@@ tion and pas@@ sed the right to order for@@ ced demo@@ li@@ tion from local govern@@ ments to the cour@@ t ."
"S@@ imi@@ lar@@ ly , many other issu@@ es con@@ cer@@ ning public sa@@ fe@@ ty is a ho@@ t top@@ ic on the Inter@@ net ."
"We heard about pol@@ lu@@ ted air , pol@@ lu@@ ted water , po@@ is@@ on@@ ed food ."
"And gu@@ ess what , we have fak@@ ed be@@ e@@ f ."
"They have sor@@ ts of in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ ts that you br@@ us@@ h on a piece of chi@@ ck@@ en or fish , and it turns it to look like be@@ e@@ f ."
"And then lat@@ ely , people are very con@@ cer@@ ned about co@@ o@@ king oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; re@@ fin@@ ing &#93; co@@ o@@ king oil from re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant s@@ lo@@ p ."
So all these things have aro@@ used a huge out@@ c@@ ry from the Inter@@ net .
"And for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , we have seen the government respon@@ ding more ti@@ me@@ ly and also more fre@@ qu@@ ently to the public con@@ cer@@ ns ."
"W@@ hi@@ le young people se@@ em to be very sure about their parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation in public poli@@ cy@@ -@@ making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their per@@ s@@ onal life ."
China is so@@ on to pas@@ s the U.@@ S.
as the number one market for lu@@ x@@ ury bran@@ ds — that &apos;s not inclu@@ ding the Chin@@ ese ex@@ pen@@ di@@ tu@@ res in Europ@@ e and el@@ se@@ where .
"But you know what , half of those con@@ sum@@ ers are ear@@ ning a s@@ al@@ ary be@@ low 2@@ ,000 U.@@ S. dollars ."
They &apos;re not ri@@ ch at all .
They &apos;re taking those b@@ ag@@ s and clo@@ the@@ s as a sense of iden@@ ti@@ ty and social stat@@ us .
And this is a girl ex@@ pli@@ ci@@ tly saying on a T@@ V d@@ ating show that she would rather c@@ ry in a B@@ M@@ W than smi@@ le on a bi@@ cy@@ cle .
"But of course , we do have young people who would still pre@@ f@@ er to smi@@ le , whether in a B@@ M@@ W or &#91; on &#93; a bi@@ cy@@ cle ."
"So in the next picture , you see a very popul@@ ar ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called &quot; &quot; na@@ ked &quot; &quot; we@@ d@@ ding , or &quot; &quot; na@@ ked &quot; &quot; mar@@ ri@@ age ."
"It does not mean they will we@@ ar nothing in the we@@ d@@ ding , but it shows that these young cou@@ ples are ready to get mar@@ ried without a house , without a car , without a di@@ am@@ ond ring and without a we@@ d@@ ding ban@@ qu@@ et , to show their com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment to true love ."
"And also , people are doing good through social media ."
And the first picture show@@ ed us that a tru@@ ck c@@ ag@@ ing 500 hom@@ el@@ ess and ki@@ d@@ na@@ pped do@@ gs for food pro@@ cess@@ ing was spo@@ t@@ ted and stop@@ ped on the high@@ way with the whole country wat@@ ching through mi@@ c@@ rob@@ lo@@ gg@@ ing .
"P@@ e@@ ople were d@@ on@@ ating money , do@@ g food and of@@ fer@@ ing vol@@ un@@ te@@ er work to stop that tru@@ ck ."
"And after hours of neg@@ oti@@ ation , 500 do@@ gs were re@@ s@@ cu@@ ed ."
And here also people are hel@@ ping to find mis@@ sing children .
A father post@@ ed his son &apos;s picture on@@ to the Inter@@ net .
"A@@ f@@ ter thousands of re@@ sen@@ ds in rel@@ ay , the child was found , and we wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed the re@@ uni@@ on of the family through mi@@ c@@ rob@@ lo@@ gg@@ ing ."
So happ@@ iness is the most popul@@ ar word we have heard through the past two years .
"H@@ app@@ iness is not only re@@ lated to per@@ s@@ onal exper@@ ien@@ ces and per@@ s@@ onal val@@ u@@ es , but also , it &apos;s about the environment ."
Pe@@ ople are thinking about the fol@@ low@@ ing questions : A@@ re we going to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce our environment f@@ ur@@ ther to produ@@ ce high@@ er G@@ D@@ P ?
"H@@ ow are we going to per@@ form our social and poli@@ tical re@@ form to keep p@@ ace with economic grow@@ th , to keep susta@@ in@@ ability and st@@ ability ?"
"And also , how cap@@ able is the system of self-@@ cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ness to keep more people cont@@ ent with all sor@@ ts of f@@ ri@@ ction going on at the same time ?"
I gu@@ ess these are the questions people are going to answer .
And our youn@@ ger gener@@ ation are going to trans@@ form this country while at the same time being trans@@ form@@ ed themselves .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"A big challen@@ ge is , how should the i@@ P@@ ads be used , and what app@@ s should we put on the i@@ P@@ ads ?"
H@@ i everybody . So my name is Ma@@ c .
"My job is that I lie to children , but they &apos;re hon@@ est l@@ ies ."
"I write children &apos;s boo@@ ks , and there &apos;s a quot@@ e from P@@ ab@@ l@@ o P@@ i@@ c@@ as@@ so , &quot; &quot; We all know that Ar@@ t is not tru@@ th ."
Ar@@ t is a lie that makes us realize tru@@ th or at least the tru@@ th that is given us to understand .
"( Laughter ) So I thought , you know what , it &apos;s what I &apos;m here to talk to you today about , though , tru@@ th and l@@ ies , fi@@ ction and re@@ ality ."
"And I said , I &apos;ve got Pow@@ er@@ Po@@ int . Let &apos;s do a V@@ en@@ n di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m ."
"That li@@ min@@ al space , that &apos;s art ."
All right . V@@ en@@ n di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very hel@@ p@@ ful either .
I used to be a sum@@ m@@ er cam@@ p coun@@ se@@ lor .
"I was in char@@ ge of the f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds , which is good , because f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds can &apos;t play spor@@ ts , and ne@@ i@@ ther can I@@ ."
"In my fan@@ t@@ asy , they were s@@ v@@ el@@ te R@@ us@@ si@@ an women , but , you know , f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds — you take what you can get in B@@ er@@ k@@ ele@@ y , C@@ alifor@@ nia ."
And I realized that the stories that I was tel@@ ling were real in this way that was fami@@ li@@ ar to me and really exci@@ ting .
"And so Ri@@ ley was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen ."
"P@@ u@@ t them in the tra@@ sh can . It ru@@ ins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And Ri@@ ley car@@ ried that me@@ l@@ on around with her all day , and she was so pro@@ u@@ d ."
It &apos;s anything . Ar@@ t can get us to that place .
"S@@ he was right in that place in the mi@@ ddle , that place which you could call art or fi@@ ction ."
I &apos;m going to call it won@@ der .
It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
"It &apos;s why in two days , people will be des@@ cen@@ ding on D@@ u@@ bli@@ n to take the wal@@ king t@@ our of B@@ lo@@ om@@ s@@ day and see everything that happened in &quot; &quot; U@@ ly@@ s@@ ses , &quot; &quot; even though n@@ one of that happened ."
"O@@ r people go to Lon@@ don and they visi@@ t B@@ ak@@ er St@@ re@@ et to see S@@ her@@ lo@@ ck H@@ ol@@ mes &apos; a@@ part@@ ment , even though 2@@ 2@@ 1@@ B is just a number that was pain@@ ted on a building that never actually had that ad@@ dre@@ ss ."
and yet we also know that they are .
"K@@ i@@ ds can get there a lot more e@@ a@@ si@@ ly than ad@@ ul@@ ts can , and that &apos;s why I love writing for kids ."
"When I was a kid , I was ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with se@@ cre@@ t door no@@ v@@ els , things like &quot; &quot; N@@ ar@@ nia , &quot; &quot; where you would open a war@@ dro@@ be and go through to a mag@@ i@@ cal land ."
And I was con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that se@@ cre@@ t do@@ ors really did exi@@ st and I would look for them and try to go through them .
There was some other we@@ ird stuff that I think my mo@@ m should know about .
( Laughter ) And I was happy to tell her all about it .
This is a place called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ cia .
There &apos;s d@@ raw@@ ers you can pu@@ ll out and get ci@@ tru@@ s so you don &apos;t get s@@ cur@@ v@@ y .
"They have e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ch@@ es in lots of col@@ ors , because when it &apos;s sp@@ r@@ ing@@ time , pi@@ r@@ ates want to go wi@@ ld ."
You don &apos;t know . B@@ l@@ ack is bor@@ ing . P@@ a@@ ste@@ l .
It &apos;s a se@@ cre@@ t door that you can walk through .
"So I ran the 8@@ 2@@ 6 in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , and it was my job to build the stor@@ e down there ."
O@@ ur frien@@ d@@ ly st@@ af@@ f is ready to help you .
"There &apos;s our E@@ m@@ plo@@ ye@@ es of the M@@ on@@ th , inclu@@ ding G@@ en@@ gh@@ is K@@ h@@ an , Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ i@@ ck@@ ens ."
S@@ ome great people have come up through our ran@@ ks .
This is our kind of ph@@ ar@@ m@@ acy se@@ ction .
O@@ ur archite@@ ct was co@@ vered in red sy@@ ru@@ p .
"M@@ am@@ mot@@ h Ch@@ un@@ ks . These things we@@ i@@ gh , like , seven po@@ un@@ ds each ."
Bar@@ bar@@ i@@ an re@@ pe@@ ll@@ ent . It &apos;s full of s@@ al@@ ad and pot@@ po@@ ur@@ r@@ i — things that bar@@ bar@@ i@@ ans h@@ ate .
De@@ ad langu@@ ages .
"And V@@ i@@ king Od@@ or@@ ant , which comes in lots of great sc@@ ents : to@@ en@@ ail@@ s , s@@ we@@ at and ro@@ t@@ ten ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les , py@@ re as@@ h ."
"O@@ ur bi@@ ggest sel@@ ler is S@@ ch@@ ad@@ en@@ fre@@ u@@ de , which we did not expe@@ ct ."
( Laughter ) We did not think that was going to happen .
"And it &apos;s a very spe@@ cial space , because it &apos;s this we@@ ird space in the front ."
The jo@@ ke isn &apos;t a jo@@ ke .
"You can &apos;t find the se@@ am@@ s on the fi@@ ction , and I love that . It &apos;s this little bit of fi@@ ction that &apos;s col@@ oni@@ zed the real world ."
I see it as kind of a book in three di@@ men@@ sions .
"There &apos;s a ter@@ m called me@@ ta@@ fi@@ ction , and that &apos;s just stories about stories , and me@@ ta &apos;s having a moment now ."
"I@@ ts last big moment was probably in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s with no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts like Joh@@ n Bar@@ th and W@@ il@@ li@@ am G@@ ad@@ d@@ is , but it &apos;s been around ."
It &apos;s almost as old as stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ling itself .
"For me , I kind of pre@@ f@@ er the op@@ posi@@ te ."
I want a book to be a se@@ cre@@ t door that open@@ s and le@@ ts the stories out into re@@ ality .
And so I try to do this in my boo@@ ks .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
So it &apos;s deli@@ vered over@@ night by F@@ ed@@ U@@ p .
( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
He lives in S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co — very t@@ ough city to own a blue wh@@ ale in .
"A lot of h@@ il@@ ls , real est@@ ate is at a pre@@ mi@@ um ."
"This market &apos;s c@@ razy , everybody ."
"But under@@ ne@@ ath the j@@ ac@@ k@@ et is this case , and that &apos;s the co@@ ver under@@ ne@@ ath the book , the j@@ ac@@ k@@ et , and there &apos;s an ad that of@@ f@@ ers a f@@ ree 3@@ 0-@@ day ri@@ sk@@ -@@ f@@ ree tri@@ al for a blue wh@@ ale ."
And you can just sen@@ d in a self-@@ ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed st@@ am@@ ped en@@ velo@@ pe and we &apos;ll sen@@ d you a wh@@ ale .
And kids do write in .
"So here &apos;s a let@@ ter . It says , &quot; &quot; De@@ ar people , I be@@ t you 10 bu@@ cks you won &apos;t sen@@ d me a blue wh@@ ale ."
But it fini@@ sh@@ es off by saying that your wh@@ ale would love to hear from you .
"He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a mess@@ age ."
"And when you call and leave him a mess@@ age , you just , on the out@@ going mess@@ age , it &apos;s just wh@@ ale sounds and then a be@@ ep , which actually sounds a lot like a wh@@ ale sound ."
And they get a picture of their wh@@ ale too .
"So this is R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph , and R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph be@@ lon@@ gs to a kid na@@ med Ni@@ co who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of Ni@@ co &apos;s mess@@ age ."
"( Au@@ di@@ o ) Ni@@ co : H@@ el@@ l@@ o , this is Ni@@ co ."
"I am your ow@@ ner , R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph . H@@ el@@ l@@ o ."
"So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you so@@ on another day . By@@ e ."
"M@@ a@@ c Bar@@ net@@ t : So Ni@@ co called back , like , an hour later ."
( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of Ni@@ co &apos;s mess@@ ages .
"( Au@@ di@@ o ) Ni@@ co : H@@ el@@ l@@ o , R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph , this is Ni@@ co ."
"I ha@@ ven &apos;t tal@@ ked to you for a long time , but I tal@@ ked to you on S@@ atur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , ye@@ ah , S@@ atur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , so now I &apos;m cal@@ ling you again to say hel@@ l@@ o and I won@@ der what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tom@@ or@@ row or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . By@@ e ."
"M@@ B : So he did , he called back that day again ."
"You find out all about him and the grand@@ ma that he lo@@ ves and the grand@@ ma that he li@@ k@@ es a little bit less — ( Laughter ) — and the cro@@ s@@ s@@ word pu@@ z@@ z@@ les that he does , and this is — I &apos;ll play you one more mess@@ age from Ni@@ co ."
This is the Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as mess@@ age from Ni@@ co .
"@@ &#91; Be@@ ep &#93; ( Au@@ di@@ o ) Ni@@ co : H@@ el@@ l@@ o , R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph , sor@@ ry I ha@@ ven &apos;t tal@@ ked to you in a long time ."
"So have a nice Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , and by@@ e-@@ by@@ e , R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph . Go@@ od@@ by@@ e ."
"H@@ is vo@@ ice is completely different , but he put his b@@ ab@@ ysi@@ t@@ ter on the phone , and she was very nice to R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph as well ."
But Ni@@ co &apos;s the best re@@ a@@ der I could hope for .
I would want any@@ one I was writing for to be in that place emoti@@ on@@ ally with the things that I create .
"I feel lu@@ ck@@ y . K@@ i@@ ds like Ni@@ co are the best re@@ ad@@ ers , and they des@@ er@@ ve the best stories we can give them ."

"( Music ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are com@@ mon@@ ly asked ; there are so many ."
"And ... Well , I gu@@ ess I could tell you a little of the history of the ther@@ em@@ in ."
"It was inv@@ en@@ ted around the 19@@ 20@@ s , and the inv@@ ent@@ or , L@@ é@@ on Th@@ er@@ em@@ in — he also was a musi@@ ci@@ an be@@ si@@ des an inv@@ ent@@ or — he came up with the idea for making the ther@@ em@@ in , I think , when he was working on some shor@@ t@@ wa@@ ve radi@@ os ."
"And there &apos;d be that sound in the sig@@ na@@ l — it &apos;s like ( S@@ cre@@ ech@@ ing ) — and he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instru@@ ment , because there are pit@@ ch@@ es in it . &quot; &quot; And so some@@ how through develo@@ ping that , he ev@@ en@@ tually came to make the ther@@ em@@ in the way it is now ."
"And a lot of times , even kids now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , they &apos;ll make re@@ fer@@ ence to a ther@@ em@@ in by going , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o@@ o@@ -@@ ho@@ o@@ -@@ ho@@ o@@ -@@ ho@@ o , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 5@@ 0s it was used in the s@@ ci@@ -@@ f@@ i hor@@ ro@@ r mov@@ ies , that sound that &apos;s like ...

"And sometimes if I have too much co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , then my vi@@ bra@@ to gets out of hand ."
You &apos;re really sen@@ si@@ tive to your body and its fun@@ ctions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
You have to st@@ ay so still if you want to have the most control .
"It re@@ min@@ ds me of the bal@@ an@@ cing act ear@@ lie@@ r on — what Mi@@ cha@@ el was doing — because you &apos;re fi@@ gh@@ ting so hard to keep the bal@@ ance with what you &apos;re playing with and st@@ ay in tu@@ ne , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to fo@@ cus so much on being in tu@@ ne all the time ; you want to be feeling the music ."
"And then also , you &apos;re trying to st@@ ay very , very , very still because little mov@@ em@@ ents with other par@@ ts of your body will af@@ fe@@ ct the pit@@ ch , or sometimes if you &apos;re hol@@ ding a low not@@ e — ( T@@ one ri@@ sing out of key ) — and bre@@ a@@ thing will make it ..."
( Laughter ) If I pas@@ s out on the next s@@ ong ... ( Laughter )
"I think of it almost like like a y@@ og@@ a instru@@ ment because it makes you so aw@@ are of every little c@@ razy thing your body is doing , or just aw@@ are of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re playing ; you don &apos;t want to have any sud@@ den mov@@ em@@ ents ."

I was made of fl@@ es@@ h but I wasn &apos;t p@@ in@@ k .
"My sk@@ in was b@@ row@@ n , and people said I was black ."
I was seven years old with a m@@ ess of col@@ ors in my head .
"B@@ y hel@@ ping in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en at a friend &apos;s par@@ ty , people thought I was the ma@@ id ."
"In some way , I get to used to it and ac@@ cept part of it ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , something inside of me ke@@ e@@ ps re@@ vol@@ ving and stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing ."
Y@@ ear@@ s later I mar@@ ried a S@@ p@@ ani@@ ard .
But not any S@@ p@@ ani@@ ard .
What will be the color of your children ?
"As you can understand , this is my last con@@ cer@@ n ."
It &apos;s a kind of g@@ ame to question our co@@ des .
It &apos;s a work in pro@@ gre@@ ss from a per@@ s@@ onal story to a global history .
"Th@@ en I cho@@ ose an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ pi@@ x@@ el squ@@ are from the no@@ se , pa@@ int the back@@ ground , and look for the cor@@ respon@@ ding color in the indu@@ stri@@ al p@@ ale@@ t@@ te , P@@ an@@ t@@ one ."
"I started with my family and friends , then more and more people jo@@ ined the ad@@ ven@@ ture , th@@ an@@ ks to public cal@@ ls coming through the social media ."
The s@@ now@@ ball started to ro@@ ll .
"I have por@@ tra@@ yed more than 3@@ ,000 people in 1@@ 3 different countries , 1@@ 9 different cities around the world ."
"A@@ ll kinds of belie@@ f@@ s , gen@@ der iden@@ ti@@ ties or physi@@ cal im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ments , a ne@@ w@@ born or ter@@ min@@ ally i@@ ll ."
We all together build H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e .
Th@@ ose por@@ tra@@ its make us re@@ think how we see each other .
"When moder@@ n science is questi@@ on@@ ing the rac@@ e con@@ cept , what does it mean for us to be black , white , y@@ el@@ low , red ?"
"I@@ s it the ey@@ e , the no@@ se , the m@@ outh , the ha@@ ir ?"
"O@@ r does it have to do with our ori@@ g@@ in , n@@ ati@@ on@@ ality or b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t ?"
This per@@ s@@ onal ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se turned out to be a disco@@ very .
S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly I realized that H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e was us@@ e@@ ful for many people .
"I have hundre@@ ds of that , I will share with you , too ."
P@@ er@@ haps we should stop .
"I &apos;m a D@@ om@@ ini@@ can@@ -@@ D@@ ut@@ ch , I gre@@ w up in a mi@@ x@@ ed family and I &apos;m a bi@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al woman . &apos; &quot; &quot; Be@@ si@@ des these u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted and tou@@ ching re@@ ac@@ tions , H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e fin@@ ds a new life in a different v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of fie@@ l@@ ds ."
"J@@ ust to show you some exam@@ ples , il@@ lu@@ str@@ at@@ ors and art students using it as a re@@ fer@@ ence for their sk@@ et@@ ch@@ es and their stud@@ ies ."
It &apos;s a colle@@ ction of fac@@ es .
"One of the most important impac@@ ts of the project is that H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e was cho@@ s@@ en to be the co@@ ver of F@@ ore@@ ig@@ n Af@@ fa@@ ir@@ s , one of the most rele@@ v@@ ant poli@@ tical publi@@ c@@ ations ."
"And talking about fore@@ ig@@ n af@@ fa@@ ir@@ s , I found the perfe@@ ct am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ ors for my project ..."
teach@@ ers .
They are the ones that use H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e as a to@@ ol for edu@@ c@@ ational pur@@ pos@@ es .
"Th@@ e@@ ir pas@@ sion en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ges me to go back to d@@ raw@@ ing clas@@ ses , but this time as a teach@@ er myself ."
"My students , both ad@@ ul@@ ts and kids , pa@@ int their self-@@ por@@ tra@@ its , trying to disco@@ ver their own uni@@ qu@@ e color ."
"As a photograph@@ er , I realize that I can be a ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l for others to communi@@ cate ."
"As an individu@@ al , as An@@ g@@ é@@ li@@ ca , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sitting in front of a ther@@ a@@ pi@@ st ."
"A@@ ll the f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation , fe@@ ar and lon@@ el@@ iness that I once felt ..."
be@@ comes love .
"The last country — the last country in the world who ab@@ o@@ li@@ shed s@@ la@@ very is the country where I was born , B@@ raz@@ il ."
We still have to work hard to ab@@ o@@ li@@ sh di@@ sc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation .
"That re@@ ma@@ ins a common prac@@ ti@@ ce wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de , and that will not disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar by itself ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
I &apos;m very for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate to be here .
I feel so for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate .
I &apos;ve been so im@@ pres@@ sed by the kin@@ d@@ ness ex@@ pres@@ sed to me .
"I called my wi@@ fe L@@ es@@ lie , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good ."
It feel@@ s like I &apos;ve lan@@ ded in a col@@ ony of ang@@ els . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true feeling .
But let me get to the talk — I see the clo@@ ck is ru@@ n@@ ning .
"I &apos;m a public school teach@@ er , and I just want to share a story of my super@@ inten@@ dent ."
"H@@ er name is P@@ am M@@ or@@ an in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty , V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , the fo@@ o@@ th@@ il@@ ls of the B@@ lu@@ e Ri@@ dge M@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ."
And she &apos;s a very high-@@ te@@ ch super@@ inten@@ dent .
"S@@ he uses s@@ mar@@ t bo@@ ar@@ ds , she blo@@ gs , she T@@ wee@@ ts , she does F@@ ace@@ book , she does all this sort of high-@@ te@@ ch stuff ."
She &apos;s a technology lea@@ der and instru@@ cti@@ onal lea@@ der .
"But in her offi@@ ce , there &apos;s this old wo@@ o@@ den , we@@ a@@ ther@@ -@@ wor@@ n table , k@@ it@@ ch@@ en table — pe@@ el@@ ing green pa@@ int , it &apos;s kind of ri@@ c@@ ke@@ ty ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ am , you &apos;re such a moder@@ n , cu@@ t@@ t@@ ing@@ -@@ ed@@ ge person ."
"Wh@@ y is this old table in your offi@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I gre@@ w up in S@@ ou@@ th@@ we@@ ster@@ n V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , in the co@@ al min@@ es and the farm@@ l@@ ands of ru@@ ral V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , and this table was in my grand@@ father &apos;s k@@ it@@ ch@@ en ."
"And we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from pl@@ ow@@ ing and working , and we &apos;d si@@ t around that table every night ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , I heard so much know@@ le@@ dge and so many in@@ si@@ ghts and so much wi@@ s@@ dom come out around this table , I began to call it the wi@@ s@@ dom table ."
"And when he pas@@ sed on , I took this table with me and brought it to my offi@@ ce , and it re@@ min@@ ds me of him ."
"It re@@ min@@ ds me of what goes on around an em@@ p@@ ty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the World Pe@@ ace G@@ ame , and essen@@ ti@@ ally it is also an em@@ p@@ ty space ."
"And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 2@@ 1@@ st century wi@@ s@@ dom table , really ."
It all started back in 19@@ 7@@ 7 .
"I was a young man , and I had been dro@@ pping in and out of colle@@ ge ."
"And my parents were very patien@@ t , but I had been doing inter@@ mi@@ t@@ t@@ ent so@@ jour@@ ns to Indi@@ a on a m@@ yst@@ i@@ cal qu@@ est ."
"And I remember the last time I came back from Indi@@ a — in my long white f@@ low@@ ing ro@@ be@@ s and my big be@@ ard and my Joh@@ n L@@ en@@ n@@ on gl@@ as@@ ses — and I said to my father , &quot; D@@ ad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , d@@ ad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they ple@@ ad@@ ed with me to get a de@@ gre@@ e in something ."
So I got a de@@ gre@@ e and it turned out to be education .
It was an experim@@ ent@@ al education program .
"It could have been den@@ ti@@ stry , but the word &quot; &quot; experim@@ ent@@ al &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for ."
"And I went in for a job inter@@ view in the Ri@@ ch@@ mon@@ d P@@ u@@ bli@@ c S@@ cho@@ ols in V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , the ca@@ pi@@ tal city , b@@ ou@@ ght a thre@@ e-@@ piece su@@ it — my con@@ ces@@ sion to con@@ ven@@ tion — ke@@ pt my long be@@ ard and my af@@ r@@ o and my pl@@ at@@ form sho@@ es — at the time it was the &apos; 7@@ 0s — and I wal@@ ked in , and I s@@ at down and had an inter@@ view ."
"And I gu@@ ess they were hard up for teach@@ ers because the super@@ vi@@ s@@ or , her name was An@@ na Ar@@ o , said I had the job teach@@ ing gi@@ f@@ ted children ."
"And I was so sh@@ oc@@ ked , so st@@ un@@ ned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , th@@ ank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) G@@ i@@ f@@ ted education ha@@ dn &apos;t really taken h@@ old too much ."
There wer@@ en &apos;t really many materi@@ als or things to use .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer sh@@ oc@@ ked me . It st@@ un@@ ned me ."
H@@ er answer set the tem@@ pl@@ ate for the entire car@@ e@@ er I was to have after that .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question c@@ lear@@ ed the space ."
"There was no program dire@@ ctive , no man@@ u@@ al to fol@@ low , no stan@@ dar@@ ds in gi@@ f@@ ted education in that way ."
"And she c@@ lear@@ ed such a space that I en@@ de@@ av@@ o@@ red from then on to clear a space for my students , an em@@ p@@ ty space , wh@@ er@@ e@@ by they could create and make me@@ an@@ ing out of their own under@@ standing ."
"So this happened in 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and I was teach@@ ing many years later , and a friend of m@@ ine in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced me to a young fil@@ m@@ mak@@ er ."
H@@ is name is Ch@@ ris F@@ ar@@ ina .
Ch@@ ris F@@ ar@@ ina is here today at his own cost .
"Ch@@ ris , could you stand up and let them see you — a young , visi@@ on@@ ary fil@@ m@@ mak@@ er who &apos;s made a film ."
( Applause ) This film is called &quot; &quot; World Pe@@ ace and O@@ ther 4@@ th G@@ ra@@ de A@@ ch@@ ie@@ v@@ em@@ ents . &quot; &quot; He pro@@ posed the film to me — it &apos;s a great ti@@ tle .
"He pro@@ posed the film to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local T@@ V , and we can say h@@ i to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the film has really gone places ."
"Now it &apos;s still in de@@ b@@ t , but Ch@@ ris has man@@ aged , through his own s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce , to get this film out ."
"So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teach@@ er ."
It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a test@@ am@@ ent to teach@@ ing and teach@@ ers .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
"And the str@@ ange thing is , when I wat@@ ch the film — I have the e@@ er@@ ie sen@@ s@@ ation of seeing it — I saw myself liter@@ ally disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar ."
What I saw was my teach@@ ers coming through me .
"I saw my ge@@ ome@@ try teach@@ er in high school , M@@ r. R@@ u@@ cell &apos;s w@@ ry smi@@ le under his hand@@ le@@ b@@ ar mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he ."
That &apos;s the smi@@ le I use — that &apos;s his smi@@ le .
I saw J@@ an P@@ ol@@ o &apos;s f@@ las@@ h@@ ing eyes .
"And they wer@@ en &apos;t f@@ las@@ h@@ ing in ang@@ er , they were f@@ las@@ h@@ ing in love , inten@@ se love for her students ."
And I have that kind of f@@ las@@ h sometimes .
And I saw M@@ is@@ s E@@ the@@ l J@@ . B@@ an@@ ks who wor@@ e pe@@ ar@@ ls and high-@@ he@@ els to ele@@ ment@@ ary school every day .
"And you know , she had that ol@@ d-@@ school teach@@ er st@@ are ."
You know the one .
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that teach@@ er ?"
"I didn &apos;t use that st@@ are very often , but I do have it in my re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re ."
And M@@ is@@ s B@@ an@@ ks was there as a great ment@@ or for me .
"And then I saw my own parents , my first teach@@ ers ."
"My father , very inv@@ enti@@ ve , sp@@ ati@@ al thin@@ k@@ er ."
That &apos;s my bro@@ ther M@@ al@@ col@@ m there on the right .
"And my mother , who t@@ au@@ ght me in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de in se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated scho@@ ols in V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , who was my in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation ."
"And really , I feel as though , when I see the film — I have a g@@ est@@ ure she does , like this — I feel like I am a contin@@ u@@ ation of her g@@ est@@ ure ."
I am one of her teach@@ ing g@@ est@@ ures .
"And the beautiful thing was , I got to te@@ ach my d@@ aughter in ele@@ ment@@ ary school , Ma@@ de@@ line ."
And so that g@@ est@@ ure of my mother &apos;s contin@@ u@@ es through many gener@@ ations .
It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lin@@ e@@ age .
And so I &apos;m here standing on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders of many people .
I &apos;m not here alone .
There are many people on this st@@ age right now .
And so this World Pe@@ ace G@@ ame I &apos;d like to tell you about .
"It started out like this : it &apos;s just a f@@ our@@ -@@ fo@@ ot by fi@@ ve@@ -@@ fo@@ ot pl@@ y@@ wood bo@@ ard in an in@@ ner@@ -@@ city urb@@ an school , 19@@ 7@@ 8 ."
I was cre@@ ating a l@@ es@@ son for students on Africa .
"We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them sol@@ ve it ."
I didn &apos;t want to le@@ cture or have just book re@@ ading .
I wanted to have them be im@@ mer@@ sed and learn the feeling of lear@@ ning through their bod@@ ies .
"So I thought , well they like to play g@@ am@@ es ."
I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say inter@@ ac@@ tive ; we didn &apos;t have that ter@@ m in 19@@ 7@@ 8 — but something inter@@ ac@@ tive .
"And so we made the g@@ ame , and it has since ev@@ olved to a f@@ our@@ -@@ fo@@ ot by f@@ our@@ -@@ fo@@ ot by f@@ our@@ -@@ fo@@ ot P@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ gl@@ as@@ s structure ."
And it has four P@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ gl@@ as@@ s la@@ y@@ ers .
There &apos;s an ou@@ ter space la@@ y@@ er with black ho@@ les and s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ tes and research s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ tes and ast@@ er@@ o@@ id min@@ ing .
"There &apos;s an air and space level with cl@@ ou@@ ds that are big pu@@ f@@ f@@ s of c@@ ot@@ ton we p@@ us@@ h around and terri@@ t@@ ori@@ al air sp@@ ac@@ es and air for@@ ces , a ground and se@@ a level with thousands of g@@ ame pie@@ ces on it — even an under@@ se@@ a level with sub@@ mar@@ ines and under@@ se@@ a min@@ ing ."
There are four countries around the bo@@ ard .
The kids make up the na@@ mes of the countries — some are ri@@ ch ; some are po@@ or .
"They have different as@@ se@@ ts , comm@@ er@@ cial and mi@@ lit@@ ary ."
And each country has a c@@ ab@@ in@@ et .
"There &apos;s a P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er , Se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary of St@@ ate , M@@ in@@ ist@@ er of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se and a C@@ F@@ O , or C@@ om@@ p@@ tro@@ l@@ ler ."
I cho@@ ose the P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er based on my relation@@ ship with them .
"I of@@ f@@ er them the job , they can turn it down , and then they cho@@ ose their own c@@ ab@@ in@@ et ."
"There &apos;s a World B@@ ank , ar@@ ms de@@ al@@ ers and a United N@@ ations ."
There &apos;s also a we@@ a@@ ther god@@ d@@ ess who contro@@ ls a ran@@ dom sto@@ ck market and ran@@ dom we@@ a@@ ther .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
And then there &apos;s a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ p@@ age cri@@ sis do@@ cu@@ ment with 50 inter@@ lo@@ c@@ king problems .
"So that , if one thing chang@@ es , everything else chang@@ es ."
"I th@@ row them into this comple@@ x mat@@ ri@@ x , and they tr@@ ust me because we have a de@@ ep , ri@@ ch relation@@ ship together ."
"And so with all these cri@@ ses , we have — let &apos;s see — e@@ th@@ nic and min@@ ori@@ ty ten@@ sions ; we have chemi@@ cal and nuclear sp@@ il@@ ls , nuclear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s oil sp@@ il@@ ls , environ@@ ment@@ al disa@@ st@@ ers , water ri@@ ghts disp@@ u@@ tes , bre@@ ak@@ away re@@ publi@@ cs , fam@@ ine , en@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed species and global war@@ ming ."
"If A@@ l G@@ ore is here , I &apos;m going to sen@@ d my f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders from A@@ g@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t and V@@ en@@ able scho@@ ols to you because they sol@@ ved global war@@ ming in a week ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it se@@ ver@@ al times too . ( Laughter )
"So I also have in the g@@ ame a s@@ ab@@ ot@@ e@@ ur — some child — it &apos;s basically a t@@ rou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er — and I have my t@@ rou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to sa@@ ve the world and their posi@@ tion in the g@@ ame ."
But they &apos;re also trying to under@@ m@@ ine everything in the g@@ ame .
"And they do it se@@ cre@@ tly through mis@@ information and am@@ bi@@ gu@@ it@@ ies and ir@@ rele@@ v@@ an@@ cies , trying to cause everyone to think more de@@ e@@ ply ."
"The s@@ ab@@ ot@@ e@@ ur is there , and we also read from Su@@ n T@@ z@@ u &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Ar@@ t of W@@ ar . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders understand it — n@@ ine years old — and they hand@@ le that and use that to understand how to , not fol@@ low — at first they do — the pa@@ ths to power and de@@ stru@@ ction , the pat@@ h to war ."
"They learn to over@@ look shor@@ t-@@ si@@ gh@@ ted re@@ ac@@ tions and im@@ pul@@ sive thinking , to think in a lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m , more con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al way ."
"S@@ te@@ war@@ t B@@ r@@ and is here , and one of the ideas for this g@@ ame came from him with a Co@@ E@@ v@@ olution Q@@ u@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly arti@@ cle on a pe@@ ace force ."
"And in the g@@ ame , sometimes students actually form a pe@@ ace force ."
I &apos;m just a clo@@ ck wat@@ ch@@ er .
I &apos;m just a c@@ lar@@ i@@ f@@ ier . I &apos;m just a fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ator .
The students run the g@@ ame .
I have no ch@@ ance to make any poli@@ cy wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever once they start playing .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
( V@@ ide@@ o ) Bo@@ y : The World Pe@@ ace G@@ ame is seri@@ ous .
You &apos;re actually getting t@@ au@@ ght something like how to take care of the world .
"S@@ e@@ e , M@@ r. H@@ un@@ ter is doing that because he says his time has mess@@ ed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fi@@ x that problem ."
"J@@ o@@ h@@ n H@@ un@@ ter : I of@@ fer@@ ed them a — ( Applause ) A@@ c@@ tually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer ."
And I ad@@ m@@ it the tru@@ th to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
"And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to di@@ g up the answer ."
And so I apo@@ logi@@ ze to them as well .
"I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sor@@ ry , bo@@ ys and girls , but the tru@@ th is we have left this world to you in such a sa@@ d and terri@@ ble sha@@ pe , and we hope you can fi@@ x it for us , and maybe this g@@ ame will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sin@@ c@@ ere apo@@ logy , and they take it very seri@@ ously ."
Now you may be wonder@@ ing what all this comple@@ x@@ ity looks like .
"Well when we have the g@@ ame start , here &apos;s what you see ."
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) J@@ H : All right , we &apos;re going into neg@@ oti@@ ations as of now . G@@ o ."
"( Ch@@ at@@ ter ) J@@ H : My question to you is , who &apos;s in char@@ ge of that clas@@ s@@ room ?"
It &apos;s a seri@@ ous question : who is really in char@@ ge ?
I &apos;ve learned to ce@@ de control of the clas@@ s@@ room over to the students over time .
There &apos;s a tr@@ ust and an under@@ standing and a de@@ di@@ cation to an ide@@ al that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teach@@ er : control every convers@@ ation and respon@@ se in the clas@@ s@@ room .
"It &apos;s im@@ possible . Th@@ e@@ ir colle@@ ctive wi@@ s@@ dom is much gre@@ ater than m@@ ine , and I ad@@ m@@ it it to them open@@ ly ."
So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some mag@@ i@@ cal things that have happened .
"In this g@@ ame we had a little girl , and she was the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ ist@@ er of the po@@ ore@@ st n@@ ation ."
And the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ ist@@ er — she had the t@@ ank cor@@ ps and A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce and so for@@ th .
"And she was next door to a very we@@ al@@ th@@ y , o@@ il@@ -@@ ri@@ ch neigh@@ b@@ or ."
"Wi@@ th@@ out pro@@ v@@ oc@@ ation , sud@@ den@@ ly she att@@ ac@@ ked , against her P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er &apos;s or@@ ders , the ne@@ x@@ t-@@ door neigh@@ b@@ or &apos;s oil fie@@ l@@ ds ."
"S@@ he mar@@ ched into the oil fie@@ ld re@@ ser@@ ves , sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded it , without fir@@ ing a sh@@ ot , and secu@@ red it and he@@ ld it ."
And that neigh@@ b@@ or was u@@ na@@ ble to con@@ du@@ ct any mi@@ lit@@ ary oper@@ ations because their fu@@ el su@@ pp@@ ly was lo@@ cked up .
"We were all up@@ set with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?"
"This is the World Pe@@ ace G@@ ame . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at n@@ ine years old , she he@@ ld her pie@@ ces and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; To her gir@@ l@@ friends she said that ."
That &apos;s a bre@@ ach there .
"And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to c@@ ross a n@@ ine year@@ -@@ old girl with tan@@ ks ."
( Laughter ) They are the tou@@ gh@@ est op@@ pon@@ ents .
And we were very up@@ set .
I thought I was fa@@ il@@ ing as a teach@@ er . Why would she do this ?
"But come to find out , a few g@@ ame days later — and there are turns where we take neg@@ oti@@ ation from a team — actually there &apos;s a neg@@ oti@@ ation per@@ i@@ od with all te@@ am@@ s , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in neg@@ oti@@ ation , around and around , so each turn around is one g@@ ame day ."
So a few g@@ ame days later it came to light that we found out this major country was plan@@ ning a mi@@ lit@@ ary of@@ f@@ en@@ sive to dom@@ in@@ ate the entire world .
"H@@ ad they had their fu@@ el sup@@ pl@@ ies , they would have done it ."
She was able to see the ve@@ ct@@ ors and tr@@ end lin@@ es and inten@@ tions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ hi@@ cal deci@@ sion to att@@ ack in a pe@@ ace g@@ ame .
"Now she used a small war to a@@ ver@@ t a lar@@ ger war , so we stop@@ ped and had a very good phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ hi@@ cal di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion about whether that was right , con@@ di@@ ti@@ onal good , or not right ."
"That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situ@@ ations ."
I could not have desig@@ ned that in teach@@ ing it .
It came about spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously through their colle@@ ctive wi@@ s@@ dom .
"( Applause ) A@@ no@@ ther example , a beautiful thing happened ."
We have a let@@ ter in the g@@ ame .
"If you &apos;re a mi@@ lit@@ ary com@@ man@@ der and you wa@@ ge tro@@ op@@ s — the little pla@@ stic to@@ ys on the bo@@ ard — and you lo@@ se them , I put in a let@@ ter ."
You have to write a let@@ ter to their parents — the fi@@ cti@@ onal parents of your fi@@ cti@@ onal tro@@ op@@ s — expla@@ ining what happened and of@@ fer@@ ing your con@@ dol@@ ences .
So you have a little bit more thought before you comm@@ it to com@@ b@@ at .
"And so we had this situ@@ ation come up — last sum@@ m@@ er actually , at A@@ g@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t S@@ cho@@ ol in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty — and one of our mi@@ lit@@ ary comm@@ and@@ ers got up to read that let@@ ter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; M@@ r. H@@ un@@ ter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a par@@ ent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a par@@ ent visi@@ ting that day , just sitting in the back of the room ."
&quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mo@@ m to read the let@@ ter .
"It &apos;ll be more re@@ al@@ er if she re@@ ads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she g@@ am@@ ely pi@@ cked up the let@@ ter ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ ure . &quot; &quot; She started re@@ ading . She read one s@@ ent@@ ence .
She read two s@@ ent@@ ences .
"B@@ y the third s@@ ent@@ ence , she was in te@@ ars ."
I was in te@@ ars .
"E@@ very@@ body under@@ sto@@ od that when we lo@@ se somebody , the win@@ n@@ ers are not g@@ lo@@ ating ."
We all lo@@ se .
And it was an amazing oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ence and an amazing under@@ standing .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend Davi@@ d says about this .
He &apos;s been in many bat@@ t@@ les .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) Davi@@ d : We &apos;ve really had enough of people att@@ ac@@ king .
"I mean , we &apos;ve been lu@@ ck@@ y &#91; most of &#93; the time ."
But now I &apos;m feeling really we@@ ird because I &apos;m living what Su@@ n T@@ z@@ u said one week .
"One week he said , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose who go into bat@@ tle and wi@@ n will want to go back , and those who lo@@ se in bat@@ tle will want to go back and wi@@ n . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been win@@ ning bat@@ t@@ les , so I &apos;m going into bat@@ t@@ les , more bat@@ t@@ les ."
And I think it &apos;s sort of we@@ ird to be living what Su@@ n T@@ z@@ u said .
J@@ H : I get chil@@ ls every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of eng@@ ag@@ ement you want to have happen .
"And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t pl@@ an that , and I can &apos;t even test that ."
But it &apos;s self-@@ evi@@ dent as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment .
We know that &apos;s an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of lear@@ ning .
"We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go be@@ y@@ ond data with the real tru@@ th of what &apos;s going on ."
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend B@@ ren@@ na@@ n .
"We had pla@@ yed the g@@ ame one s@@ es@@ sion after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essen@@ ti@@ ally sol@@ ved all 50 of the inter@@ lo@@ c@@ king cri@@ ses ."
The way the g@@ ame is won is all 50 problems have to be sol@@ ved and every country &apos;s as@@ set val@@ ue has to be incre@@ as@@ ed ab@@ o@@ ve its star@@ ting point .
"S@@ ome are po@@ or , some are we@@ al@@ th@@ y . There are bi@@ llions ."
The World B@@ ank pre@@ si@@ dent was a th@@ ir@@ d-@@ gra@@ der one time .
"He says , &quot; &quot; How many zer@@ os in a tri@@ llion ? I &apos;ve got to cal@@ cul@@ ate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was se@@ tting fi@@ sc@@ al poli@@ cy in that g@@ ame for high school pla@@ y@@ ers who were playing with him ."
So the team that was the po@@ ore@@ st had got@@ ten even po@@ ore@@ r .
There was no way they could wi@@ n .
"And we were appro@@ ach@@ ing four o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck , our cu@@ t-@@ off time — there was about a minu@@ te left — and des@@ pa@@ ir just se@@ t@@ t@@ led over the room ."
"I thought , I &apos;m fa@@ il@@ ing as a teach@@ er ."
I should have got@@ ten it so they could have won .
They sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be fa@@ il@@ ing like this .
I &apos;ve fai@@ led them .
And I was just feeling so sa@@ d and de@@ je@@ cted .
"And sud@@ den@@ ly , B@@ ren@@ na@@ n wal@@ ked over to my cha@@ ir and he gra@@ b@@ bed the be@@ ll , the be@@ ll I ring to sig@@ na@@ l a change or a re@@ con@@ ven@@ ing of c@@ ab@@ in@@ ets , and he ran back to his se@@ at , ran@@ g the be@@ ll ."
"E@@ very@@ body ran to his cha@@ ir : there was scre@@ am@@ ing ; there was y@@ el@@ ling , wa@@ ving of their do@@ s@@ sie@@ r@@ s ."
They get these do@@ s@@ sie@@ r@@ s full of se@@ cre@@ t do@@ cu@@ ments .
They were g@@ esti@@ cu@@ lat@@ ing ; they were ru@@ n@@ ning around .
I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my clas@@ s@@ room .
"P@@ r@@ in@@ ci@@ p@@ al wal@@ ks in , I &apos;m out of a job ."
The parents were looking in the win@@ do@@ w .
And B@@ ren@@ na@@ n ru@@ ns back to his se@@ at . E@@ very@@ body ru@@ ns back to their se@@ at .
"He r@@ ings the be@@ ll again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 secon@@ ds left on the clo@@ ck — &quot; &quot; we have , all n@@ ations , po@@ o@@ led all our fun@@ ds together ."
And we &apos;ve got 6@@ 00 billion dollars .
We &apos;re going to of@@ f@@ er it as a d@@ on@@ ation to this po@@ or country .
"And if they ac@@ cept it , it &apos;ll ra@@ ise their as@@ set val@@ ue and we can wi@@ n the g@@ ame ."
Wi@@ ll you ac@@ cept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three secon@@ ds left on the clo@@ ck .
"E@@ very@@ body looks at this pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And the g@@ ame is won ."
"S@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous comp@@ as@@ sion that could not be plan@@ ned for , that was u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted and un@@ pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able ."
E@@ very g@@ ame we play is different .
"S@@ ome g@@ am@@ es are more about social issu@@ es , some are more about economic issu@@ es ."
S@@ ome g@@ am@@ es are more about war@@ f@@ are .
But I don &apos;t try to den@@ y them that re@@ ality of being human .
"I al@@ low them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a blo@@ od@@ less way , how not to do what they consi@@ der to be the wrong thing ."
"And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves ."
"And so in this g@@ ame , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pi@@ ck up a cri@@ tical thinking to@@ ol or cre@@ ative thinking to@@ ol from this g@@ ame and le@@ ver@@ age something good for the world , they may sa@@ ve us all ."
If only .
"And on be@@ half of all of my teach@@ ers on wh@@ ose sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders I &apos;m standing , th@@ ank you . Thank you . Thank you ."
( Applause )
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small tow@@ n kid .
"I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story ."
He lives in a small vi@@ ll@@ age in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ om@@ ali@@ a .
H@@ is vi@@ ll@@ age is ne@@ ar M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u .
D@@ rought dri@@ ves the small vi@@ ll@@ age into po@@ ver@@ ty and to the br@@ in@@ k of star@@ vation .
"Wi@@ th nothing left for him there , he lea@@ ves for the big city , in this case , M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u , the ca@@ pi@@ tal of S@@ om@@ ali@@ a ."
"When he ar@@ ri@@ ves , there are no opportuni@@ ties , no j@@ ob@@ s , no way forward ."
He en@@ ds up living in a t@@ ent city on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u .
"M@@ a@@ ybe a year pas@@ ses , nothing ."
"One day , he &apos;s appro@@ ach@@ ed by a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man who of@@ f@@ ers to take him to lu@@ n@@ ch , then to din@@ ner , to bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast ."
"He me@@ ets this dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c group of people , and they give him a bre@@ ak ."
"He &apos;s given a bit of money to bu@@ y hi@@ m@@ self some new clo@@ the@@ s , money to sen@@ d back home to his family ."
He is in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced to this young woman .
He ev@@ en@@ tually gets mar@@ ried .
He star@@ ts this new life .
He has a pur@@ pos@@ e in life .
"One beautiful day in M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u , under an az@@ ure blue sk@@ y , a car b@@ om@@ b goes off ."
"That small tow@@ n kid with the big city dre@@ am@@ s was the su@@ i@@ ci@@ de b@@ om@@ ber , and that dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c group of people were al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b , a ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ st organiz@@ ation lin@@ ked to al Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a ."
So how does the story of a small tow@@ n kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him b@@ low@@ ing hi@@ m@@ self up ?
He was wai@@ ting .
"He was wai@@ ting for an opportunity , wai@@ ting to beg@@ in his future , wai@@ ting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along ."
This was the first thing that pul@@ led him out of what we call wai@@ th@@ o@@ od .
And his story re@@ pe@@ ats itself in urb@@ an cen@@ ters around the world .
"It is the story of the di@@ sen@@ f@@ ran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed , u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ yed urb@@ an y@@ outh who sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ ots in Joh@@ an@@ n@@ es@@ bur@@ g , sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ ots in Lon@@ don , who re@@ ach@@ es out for something other than wai@@ th@@ o@@ od ."
"For young people , the pro@@ mi@@ se of the city , the big city dre@@ am is that of opportunity , of j@@ ob@@ s , of we@@ alth , but young people are not sh@@ aring in the pro@@ sp@@ eri@@ ty of their cities ."
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s y@@ outh who su@@ f@@ f@@ er from the high@@ est u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment r@@ ates .
"B@@ y 20@@ 30 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 ."
"If we do not inclu@@ de young people in the grow@@ th of our cities , if we do not provi@@ de them opportuni@@ ties , the story of wai@@ th@@ o@@ od , the g@@ ate@@ way to ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sm , to violence , to g@@ an@@ gs , will be the story of cities 2@@ .@@ 0 ."
"And in my city of bir@@ th , M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u , 70 percent of young people su@@ f@@ f@@ er from u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment ."
"@@ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school ."
They pretty much do nothing .
"I went back to M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u last mon@@ th , and I went to visi@@ t M@@ ad@@ ina H@@ o@@ spit@@ al , the ho@@ spit@@ al I was born in ."
"I remember standing in front of that bu@@ l@@ let@@ -@@ ri@@ d@@ den ho@@ spit@@ al thinking , what if I had never left ?"
What if I had been for@@ ced into that same state of wai@@ th@@ o@@ od ?
W@@ ould I have become a ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ st ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
My reason for being in M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u that mon@@ th was actually to ho@@ st a y@@ outh le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship and ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship sum@@ m@@ it .
I brought together about 90 young S@@ om@@ ali le@@ ad@@ ers .
We s@@ at down and bra@@ in@@ stor@@ med on solu@@ tions to the bi@@ ggest challen@@ ges fac@@ ing their city .
One of the young men in the room was A@@ den .
"He went to uni@@ versity in M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u , gra@@ du@@ ated ."
"There were no j@@ ob@@ s , no opportuni@@ ties ."
"I remember him tel@@ ling me , because he was a colle@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ate , u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ yed , f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated , that he was the perfe@@ ct tar@@ get for al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b and other ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ st organiz@@ ations , to be re@@ c@@ ru@@ i@@ ted ."
They s@@ ou@@ ght people like him out .
But his story takes a different rou@@ te .
"In M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u , the bi@@ ggest bar@@ r@@ ier to getting from point A to point B are the ro@@ ads ."
"T@@ wen@@ ty@@ -@@ three years of ci@@ vi@@ l war have completely de@@ stro@@ yed the ro@@ ad system , and a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke can be the e@@ as@@ ie@@ st way to get around ."
A@@ den saw an opportunity and se@@ i@@ zed it .
He started a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke company .
He began r@@ ent@@ ing out mot@@ or@@ bi@@ k@@ es to local resi@@ d@@ ents who couldn &apos;t nor@@ m@@ ally af@@ for@@ d them .
"He b@@ ou@@ ght 10 bi@@ k@@ es , with the help of family and friends , and his dre@@ am is to ev@@ en@@ tually ex@@ p@@ and to se@@ ver@@ al hundre@@ d within the next three years ."
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to iden@@ ti@@ fy and se@@ i@@ ze a new opportunity .
"It &apos;s ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship , and I believe ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship can be the most powerful to@@ ol against wai@@ th@@ o@@ od ."
It em@@ pow@@ ers young people to be the cre@@ at@@ ors of the very economic opportuni@@ ties they are so des@@ per@@ ately see@@ king .
And you can tra@@ in young people to be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s .
"I want to talk to you about a young man who at@@ ten@@ ded one of my me@@ et@@ ings , Mo@@ ha@@ med Mo@@ ha@@ m@@ ou@@ d , a fl@@ ori@@ st ."
He was hel@@ ping me tra@@ in some of the young people at the sum@@ m@@ it in ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship and how to be in@@ no@@ v@@ ative and how to create a culture of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship .
"He &apos;s actually the first fl@@ ori@@ st M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u has seen in over 2@@ 2 years , and until re@@ cent@@ ly , until Mo@@ ha@@ med came along , if you wanted f@@ low@@ ers at your we@@ d@@ ding , you used pla@@ stic b@@ ou@@ qu@@ ets shi@@ pped from ab@@ ro@@ ad ."
"If you asked someone , &quot; When was the last time you saw fre@@ sh f@@ low@@ ers ? &quot;"
"@@ for many who gre@@ w up under ci@@ vi@@ l war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever . &quot; &quot; So Mo@@ ha@@ med saw an opportunity ."
He started a land@@ s@@ ca@@ ping and design fl@@ or@@ al company .
"He created a far@@ m right outside of M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u , and started grow@@ ing tu@@ li@@ ps and li@@ l@@ ies , which he said could survi@@ ve the har@@ sh M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u clim@@ ate ."
"And he began deli@@ ver@@ ing f@@ low@@ ers to we@@ dd@@ ings , cre@@ ating gar@@ den@@ s at hom@@ es and bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es around the city , and he &apos;s now working on cre@@ ating M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u &apos;s first public par@@ k in 2@@ 2 years ."
There &apos;s no public par@@ k in M@@ og@@ ad@@ i@@ sh@@ u .
"He wan@@ ts to create a space where fam@@ il@@ ies , young people , can come together , and , as he says , s@@ me@@ ll the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ro@@ ses ."
"And he doesn &apos;t gro@@ w ro@@ ses because they use too much water , by the way ."
"So the first ste@@ p is to inspi@@ re young people , and in that room , Mo@@ ha@@ med &apos;s pre@@ sen@@ ce had a really pro@@ found impac@@ t on the y@@ outh in that room ."
They had never really thought about star@@ ting up a business .
"They &apos;ve thought about working for an N@@ G@@ O , working for the government , but his story , his in@@ no@@ vation , really had a stron@@ g impac@@ t on them ."
He for@@ ced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
"He em@@ power@@ ed them to believe that they could be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s , that they could be change mak@@ ers ."
"B@@ y the end of the day , they were coming up with in@@ no@@ v@@ ative solu@@ tions to some of the bi@@ ggest challen@@ ges fac@@ ing their city ."
They came up with ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ u@@ ri@@ al solu@@ tions to local problems .
"So in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing young people and cre@@ ating a culture of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship is a really great ste@@ p , but young people need ca@@ pi@@ tal to make their ideas a re@@ ality ."
They need exper@@ ti@@ se and ment@@ or@@ ship to gu@@ i@@ de them in develo@@ ping and la@@ un@@ ching their bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es .
"C@@ on@@ ne@@ ct young people with the re@@ sources they need , provi@@ de them the sup@@ port they need to go from ide@@ ation to cre@@ ation , and you will create cat@@ al@@ yst@@ s for urb@@ an grow@@ th ."
"For me , ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship is more than just star@@ ting up a business ."
It &apos;s about cre@@ ating a social impac@@ t .
Mo@@ ha@@ med is not simply sel@@ ling f@@ low@@ ers .
I believe he is sel@@ ling hope .
"H@@ is Pe@@ ace Par@@ k , and that &apos;s what he cal@@ ls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually trans@@ form the way people see their city ."
A@@ den hi@@ red stre@@ et kids to help r@@ ent out and ma@@ in@@ tain those bi@@ k@@ es for him .
He gave them the opportunity to es@@ cape the par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s of wai@@ th@@ o@@ od .
These young ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s are having a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous impac@@ t in their cities .
"So my su@@ gg@@ esti@@ on is , turn y@@ outh into ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s , in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate and n@@ ur@@ ture their in@@ her@@ ent in@@ no@@ vation , and you will have more stories of f@@ low@@ ers and Pe@@ ace Par@@ ks than of car b@@ om@@ b@@ s and wai@@ th@@ o@@ od ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"O@@ kay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play ."
I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be a little music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
"( Music ) ( Applause ) O@@ kay , so first of all , let &apos;s wel@@ come M@@ r. J@@ ami@@ re W@@ il@@ li@@ am@@ s on the dru@@ ms , ( Applause ) Bu@@ r@@ ni@@ ss T@@ ra@@ v@@ is on the bas@@ s , ( Applause ) and M@@ r. Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an S@@ ands on the pi@@ ano . ( Applause )"
"So the b@@ and@@ stand , as we call it , this is an incredible space ."
It is really a s@@ ac@@ red space .
"And one of the things that is really s@@ ac@@ red about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past ."
You really are ali@@ ve right here in this moment .
There are so many deci@@ sions being made when you walk on the b@@ and@@ stand .
We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
"In the mi@@ ddle , we sort of made our way into a s@@ ong called &quot; &quot; T@@ it@@ i Bo@@ om . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not ."
E@@ very@@ one &apos;s list@@ ening . We &apos;re respon@@ ding .
You have no time for proje@@ cted ideas .
"So the idea of a mist@@ ake : F@@ ro@@ m the perspe@@ ctive of a j@@ az@@ z musi@@ ci@@ an , it &apos;s e@@ as@@ ier to talk about someone else &apos;s mist@@ ake ."
"So the way I per@@ cei@@ ve a mist@@ ake when I &apos;m on the b@@ and@@ stand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mist@@ ake ."
The only mist@@ ake l@@ ies in that I &apos;m not able to per@@ cei@@ ve what it is that someone else did .
E@@ very &quot; &quot; mist@@ ake &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in j@@ az@@ z .
So it &apos;s hard to even descri@@ be what a fun@@ ny not@@ e would be .
"So for example , if I pla@@ yed a color , like we were playing on a p@@ ale@@ t@@ te , that soun@@ ded like this ..."
( Music ) So if Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an pla@@ yed a not@@ e — like play an F@@ . ( Music )
"S@@ e@@ e , these are all right inside of the color p@@ ale@@ t@@ te ."
If you pla@@ yed an E@@ .
"S@@ e@@ e , these all lie right inside of this gener@@ al emoti@@ onal p@@ ale@@ t@@ te that we were pain@@ ting ."
"If you pla@@ yed an F # though , ( D@@ is@@ son@@ ance ) to most people &apos;s ear@@ s , they would per@@ cei@@ ve that as a mist@@ ake ."
"So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second ."
And we &apos;re going to play on this p@@ ale@@ t@@ te .
"And at some point , Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an will in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce this not@@ e ."
And we won &apos;t re@@ act to it .
"He &apos;ll in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second ."
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this p@@ ale@@ t@@ te .
( Music ) So someone could con@@ cep@@ tually per@@ cei@@ ve that as a mist@@ ake .
The only way that I would say it was a mist@@ ake is in that we didn &apos;t re@@ act to it .
It was an opportunity that was mis@@ sed .
So it &apos;s un@@ pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able . We &apos;ll pa@@ int this p@@ ale@@ t@@ te again .
"He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll re@@ act to it , but something will change ."
"We &apos;ll all ac@@ cept his ideas , or not ."
"( Music ) So you see , he pla@@ yed this not@@ e ."
I en@@ ded up cre@@ ating a me@@ lo@@ dy out of it .
The te@@ x@@ ture changed in the dru@@ ms this time .
"It got a little bit more r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ c , a little bit more inten@@ se in respon@@ se to how I respon@@ ded to it ."
So there is no mist@@ ake .
"The only mist@@ ake is if I &apos;m not aw@@ are , if each individu@@ al musi@@ ci@@ an is not aw@@ are and ac@@ cep@@ ting enough of his fel@@ low b@@ and member to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate the idea and we don &apos;t al@@ low for cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"So j@@ az@@ z , this b@@ and@@ stand is absolu@@ tely amazing ."
It &apos;s a very pu@@ ri@@ f@@ ying experience .
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for gran@@ ted .
We know that to be able to come on the b@@ and@@ stand and play music is a bl@@ ess@@ ing .
So how does this all rel@@ ate to behavi@@ or@@ al fin@@ ance ?
"Well we &apos;re j@@ az@@ z musi@@ ci@@ ans , so ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pi@@ cally we don &apos;t have a great relation@@ ship to fin@@ ance ."
"( Laughter ) An@@ y@@ way , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we hand@@ le it ."
And the other dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c of it is that we don &apos;t micro@@ man@@ age in j@@ az@@ z .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually li@@ mi@@ ts the arti@@ stic possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies .
"If I come up and I di@@ ct@@ ate to the b@@ and that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just j@@ um@@ p right in ..."
"@@ ready , just play some time ."
"One , two , one , two , three , four ."
( Music ) It &apos;s kind of cha@@ oti@@ c because I &apos;m bu@@ ll@@ ying my ideas .
"I &apos;m tel@@ ling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to list@@ en ."
This is a science of list@@ ening .
It has far more to do with what I can per@@ cei@@ ve than what it is that I can do .
"So if I want the music to get to a certain level of inten@@ sity , the first ste@@ p for me is to be patien@@ t , to list@@ en to what &apos;s going on and pu@@ ll from something that &apos;s going on around me ."
"When you do that , you eng@@ age and inspi@@ re the other musi@@ ci@@ ans and they give you more , and gra@@ du@@ ally it buil@@ ds ."
"W@@ at@@ ch . One , two , a one , two , three , four ."
( Music ) T@@ ot@@ ally different experience when I &apos;m pul@@ ling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organi@@ c . It &apos;s much more nu@@ an@@ ced .
It &apos;s not about bu@@ ll@@ ying my vision or anything like that .
"It &apos;s about being here in the moment , ac@@ cep@@ ting one another and allow@@ ing cre@@ ati@@ vity to f@@ low ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real challen@@ ges is to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate fundam@@ ent@@ ally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ th@@ r@@ al@@ led to in education ."
This one teach@@ er didn &apos;t take it seri@@ ously .
"I want to say that really and tru@@ ly , after these incredible spe@@ ech@@ es and ideas that are being sp@@ read , I am in the aw@@ k@@ ward posi@@ tion of being here to talk to you today about tele@@ vision ."
So most everyone wat@@ ch@@ es T@@ V .
We like it . We like some par@@ ts of it .
"H@@ ere in America , people actually love T@@ V ."
The a@@ ver@@ age American wat@@ ch@@ es T@@ V for almost 5 hours a day .
O@@ kay ?
"Now I happen to make my living these days in tele@@ vision , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing ."
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
"They , in fact , ber@@ ate it ."
"They call it stu@@ pi@@ d , and wor@@ se , believe me ."
"My mother , grow@@ ing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; i@@ di@@ ot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to de@@ b@@ ate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good T@@ V or bad T@@ V ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe tele@@ vision has a con@@ science ."
"So why I believe that tele@@ vision has a con@@ science is that I actually believe that tele@@ vision dire@@ ct@@ ly ref@@ le@@ cts the mor@@ al , poli@@ tical , social and emoti@@ onal need st@@ ates of our n@@ ation — that tele@@ vision is how we actually dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate our entire val@@ ue system ."
"So all these things are uni@@ qu@@ ely human , and they all ad@@ d up to our idea of con@@ science ."
"Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad T@@ V ."
We &apos;re talking about popul@@ ar T@@ V .
We &apos;re talking about top@@ -@@ 10 N@@ ie@@ l@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated shows over the course of 50 years .
"H@@ ow do these N@@ ie@@ l@@ s@@ en rat@@ ings ref@@ le@@ ct not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , colle@@ ctive un@@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous , but how do these top@@ -@@ 10 N@@ ie@@ l@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated shows over 50 years ref@@ le@@ ct the idea of our social con@@ science ?"
"H@@ ow does tele@@ vision ev@@ ol@@ ve over time , and what does this say about our society ?"
"Now spe@@ aking of ev@@ olution , from basi@@ c bio@@ logy , you probably remember that the ani@@ mal k@@ ing@@ dom , inclu@@ ding hum@@ ans , have four basi@@ c pri@@ mal in@@ st@@ in@@ cts ."
You have hun@@ ger ; you have se@@ x ; you have power ; and you have the ur@@ ge for ac@@ qui@@ si@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess .
"As hum@@ ans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve develo@@ ped , we &apos;ve ev@@ olved over time to tem@@ per , or tam@@ e , these basi@@ c ani@@ mal in@@ st@@ in@@ cts ."
We have the ca@@ pac@@ ity to l@@ au@@ gh and c@@ ry .
"We feel a@@ we , we feel pi@@ ty ."
That is se@@ par@@ ate and a@@ part from the ani@@ mal k@@ ing@@ dom .
The other thing about human be@@ ings is that we love to be en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ined .
We love to wat@@ ch T@@ V .
This is something that c@@ lear@@ ly se@@ par@@ ates us from the ani@@ mal k@@ ing@@ dom .
"A@@ ni@@ m@@ als might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to wat@@ ch ."
So I had an am@@ bi@@ tion to disco@@ ver what could be under@@ sto@@ od from this uni@@ qu@@ ely human relation@@ ship between tele@@ vision progra@@ ms and the human con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous .
Why has tele@@ vision en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment ev@@ olved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this car@@ to@@ on de@@ vi@@ l or ang@@ el sitting on our sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders .
"I@@ s tele@@ vision liter@@ ally fun@@ cti@@ on@@ ing as our con@@ science , tem@@ p@@ ting us and re@@ war@@ ding us at the same time ?"
"So to beg@@ in to answer these questions , we did a research study ."
We went back 50 years to the 19@@ 5@@ 9 / 19@@ 60 tele@@ vision se@@ as@@ on .
We sur@@ ve@@ yed the top@@ -@@ 20 N@@ ie@@ l@@ s@@ en shows every year for 50 years — a thous@@ and shows .
"We tal@@ ked to over 3@@ ,000 individu@@ als — almost 3@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 — aged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emoti@@ on@@ ally ."
How did you feel wat@@ ching every single one of these shows ?
D@@ id you feel a sense of mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity ?
D@@ id you feel ou@@ tra@@ ge ? D@@ id you l@@ au@@ gh ?
What did this mean for you ?
"So to our global TED aud@@ ien@@ ces , I want to say that this was a U.@@ S. sam@@ ple ."
"But as you can see , these emoti@@ onal need st@@ ates are tru@@ ly uni@@ vers@@ al ."
"And on a fac@@ tu@@ al basi@@ s , over 80 percent of the U.@@ S. &apos; s most popul@@ ar shows are ex@@ por@@ ted around the world ."
So I really hope our global aud@@ ien@@ ces can rel@@ ate .
"T@@ wo ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ments before our first data sli@@ de : F@@ or in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing me to even think about the idea of con@@ science and the tri@@ cks that con@@ science can play on us on a da@@ i@@ ly basi@@ s , I th@@ ank le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary ra@@ b@@ b@@ i , J@@ ack S@@ ter@@ n ."
"And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to th@@ ank TED community super@@ st@@ ar H@@ ans R@@ os@@ ling , who you may have just seen ."
"O@@ kay , here we go ."
"So here you see , from 19@@ 60 to 20@@ 10 , the 50 years of our study ."
"T@@ wo things we &apos;re going to start with — the in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation state and the mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity state , which , for this pur@@ pos@@ e , we de@@ fin@@ ed in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation as tele@@ vision shows that up@@ li@@ ft me , that make me feel much more posi@@ tive about the world ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity are tele@@ vi@@ sions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
"As we start , you see in 19@@ 60 in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation is hol@@ ding ste@@ ady ."
That &apos;s what we &apos;re wat@@ ching T@@ V for .
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity star@@ ts to clim@@ b .
"R@@ ight at the end of the 6@@ 0s , mor@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity is going up , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation is kind of on the w@@ ane ."
Why ?
"The C@@ u@@ b@@ an M@@ is@@ si@@ le C@@ ri@@ sis , J@@ F@@ K is sh@@ ot , the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ igh@@ ts movement , rac@@ e ri@@ ots , the V@@ ie@@ t@@ nam W@@ ar , M@@ L@@ K is sh@@ ot , B@@ ob@@ by Ken@@ ne@@ dy is sh@@ ot , W@@ at@@ er@@ g@@ ate ."
L@@ ook what happens .
"In 19@@ 70 , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation p@@ lu@@ m@@ me@@ ts ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity takes off .
"They c@@ ross , but R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an , a te@@ leg@@ eni@@ c pre@@ si@@ dent , is in offi@@ ce ."
It &apos;s trying to re@@ co@@ ver .
"But look , it can &apos;t : AIDS , I@@ ran@@ -@@ Con@@ tra , the Ch@@ al@@ len@@ ger disa@@ ster , Ch@@ er@@ no@@ by@@ l ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity be@@ comes the dom@@ in@@ ant me@@ me in tele@@ vision from 199@@ 0 for the next 20 years .
T@@ ake a look at this .
This char@@ t is going to do@@ cu@@ ment a very si@@ mi@@ lar tr@@ end .
"But in this case , we have comfor@@ t — the bu@@ b@@ ble in red — social com@@ ment@@ ary and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence in blue and green ."
"Now this time on T@@ V you have &quot; &quot; B@@ on@@ an@@ za , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t for@@ get , you have &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ smo@@ ke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ f@@ fi@@ th , &quot; &quot; you have dom@@ esti@@ c shows all about comfor@@ t ."
This is ri@@ sing . C@@ om@@ for@@ t sta@@ ys whole .
I@@ r@@ re@@ ver@@ ence star@@ ts to ri@@ se .
S@@ o@@ cial com@@ ment@@ ary is all of a sud@@ den spi@@ king up .
"You get to 19@@ 6@@ 9 , and look what happens ."
"You have comfor@@ t , ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence , and social com@@ ment@@ ary , not only bat@@ t@@ ling it out in our society , but you liter@@ ally have two est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment shows — &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ smo@@ ke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; G@@ om@@ er P@@ y@@ le &quot; &quot; — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 are the num@@ ber@@ -@@ two@@ - and num@@ ber@@ -@@ thre@@ e-@@ r@@ ated tele@@ vision shows ."
What &apos;s number one ?
"The so@@ cially ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent hi@@ pp@@ ie show , &quot; R@@ ow@@ an and Mar@@ t@@ in &apos;s L@@ augh@@ -@@ In . &quot;"
"They &apos;re all living together , right ."
V@@ ie@@ w@@ ers had respon@@ ded dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally .
L@@ ook at this green spi@@ ke in 19@@ 6@@ 6 to a be@@ ll@@ we@@ ther show .
"When you guys hear this indu@@ stry ter@@ m , a bre@@ ak@@ out h@@ it , what does that mean ?"
"It means in the 19@@ 6@@ 6 tele@@ vision se@@ as@@ on , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mo@@ thers B@@ ro@@ thers &quot; &quot; came out of now@@ here ."
"This was the first show that allow@@ ed vie@@ w@@ ers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can com@@ ment on how I feel about the V@@ ie@@ t@@ nam W@@ ar , about the pre@@ si@@ den@@ cy , through tele@@ vision ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a bre@@ ak@@ out show ."
"So then , just like the last char@@ t , look what happens ."
"In 19@@ 70 , the d@@ am bur@@ sts . The d@@ am bur@@ sts ."
C@@ om@@ for@@ t is no longer why we wat@@ ch tele@@ vision .
S@@ o@@ cial com@@ ment@@ ary and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence ri@@ se throu@@ gh@@ out the 7@@ 0s .
Now look at this .
The 7@@ 0s means who ? Nor@@ man Le@@ ar .
"You have &quot; &quot; All in the F@@ ami@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ an@@ for@@ d and S@@ on , &quot; &quot; and the dom@@ in@@ ant show — in the top@@ -@@ 10 for the entire 7@@ 0s — &quot; M@@ A@@ S * H@@ . &quot;"
"In the entire 50 years of tele@@ vision that we stud@@ ied , seven of 10 shows ran@@ ked most high@@ ly for ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence ap@@ pe@@ ared on air during the V@@ ie@@ t@@ nam W@@ ar , five of the top@@ -@@ 10 during the Ni@@ x@@ on ad@@ min@@ ist@@ r@@ ation ."
"O@@ n@@ ly one gener@@ ation , 20 years in , and we disco@@ vered , W@@ ow ! T@@ V can do that ?"
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
"So to this very , very sa@@ v@@ v@@ y c@@ row@@ d , I also want to not@@ e the di@@ gi@@ tal fol@@ ks did not inv@@ ent dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tive ."
Ar@@ ch@@ ie B@@ un@@ k@@ er was sho@@ ved out of his e@@ asy cha@@ ir along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
"This is a qui@@ ck char@@ t . Here &apos;s another at@@ tri@@ bu@@ te : fan@@ t@@ asy and imag@@ in@@ ation , which are shows de@@ fin@@ ed as , &quot; takes me out of my every@@ day re@@ al@@ m &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ma@@ pped against the red do@@ t , u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment , which is a simple Bu@@ re@@ a@@ u of L@@ ab@@ or De@@ part@@ ment st@@ ati@@ stic ."
"You &apos;ll see that every time fan@@ t@@ asy and imag@@ in@@ ation shows ri@@ se , it ma@@ ps to a spi@@ ke in u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment ."
Do we want to see shows about people sa@@ ving money and being u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ yed ?
"No . In the 7@@ 0s you have the be@@ ll@@ we@@ ther show &quot; &quot; The Bi@@ on@@ ic W@@ om@@ an &quot; &quot; that ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ted into the top@@ -@@ 10 in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , fol@@ low@@ ed by the &quot; &quot; S@@ i@@ x M@@ il@@ li@@ on-@@ D@@ ol@@ lar M@@ an &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ar@@ lie &apos;s An@@ g@@ els . &quot; &quot; A@@ no@@ ther spi@@ ke in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s — another spi@@ ke in shows about control and power ."
What were those shows ?
G@@ la@@ mo@@ rou@@ s and ri@@ ch .
"&quot; D@@ al@@ l@@ as , &quot; &quot; F@@ an@@ t@@ asy Is@@ land . &quot;"
In@@ cre@@ di@@ ble ma@@ pping of our national psy@@ ch@@ e with some hard and f@@ ast fac@@ ts : u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment .
"So here you are , in my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te char@@ t , because this is our last 20 years ."
"W@@ he@@ ther or not you &apos;re in my business , you have su@@ re@@ ly heard or read of the dec@@ line of the thing called the thre@@ e-@@ cam@@ era si@@ t@@ co@@ m and the ri@@ se of re@@ ality T@@ V ."
"Well , as we say in the business , X mar@@ ks the spo@@ t ."
"The 9@@ 0s — the big bu@@ b@@ b@@ les of hu@@ mo@@ r — we &apos;re wat@@ ching &quot; &quot; F@@ r@@ ien@@ ds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ra@@ sie@@ r , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ e@@ ers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ in@@ fe@@ ld . &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing &apos;s good , low u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ y@@ ment ."
But look : X mar@@ ks the spo@@ t .
"In 200@@ 1 , the Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 200@@ 1 tele@@ vision se@@ as@@ on , hu@@ mo@@ r suc@@ cu@@ m@@ b@@ s to ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment once and for all ."
Why not ?
We had a 2@@ 000 pre@@ si@@ den@@ tial ele@@ ction decided by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
We had the bur@@ st@@ ing of the te@@ ch bu@@ b@@ ble .
We had 9 / 11 .
An@@ th@@ ra@@ x be@@ comes part of the social le@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ on .
L@@ ook what happens when we keep going .
"A@@ t the turn of the century , the Inter@@ net takes off , re@@ ality tele@@ vision has taken h@@ old ."
What do people want in their T@@ V then ?
I would have thought re@@ ven@@ ge or no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
G@@ i@@ ve me some comfor@@ t ; my world is fal@@ ling a@@ part .
"No , they want ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment ."
I can v@@ ot@@ e you off the is@@ land .
I can keep S@@ ar@@ ah P@@ al@@ in &apos;s d@@ aughter dan@@ cing .
I can cho@@ ose the next American I@@ do@@ l . You &apos;re fi@@ red .
"That &apos;s all great , right ?"
"So as dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally different as these tele@@ vision shows , pu@@ re en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one basi@@ c in@@ st@@ in@@ ct re@@ ma@@ ins ."
"We &apos;re animals , we need our mom@@ s ."
"There has not been a dec@@ ade of tele@@ vision without a defini@@ tive , dom@@ in@@ ant T@@ V mo@@ m ."
"The 19@@ 5@@ 0s : Ju@@ ne C@@ le@@ ever in the ori@@ gin@@ al comfor@@ t show , &quot; &quot; Le@@ a@@ ve it to Be@@ a@@ ver . &quot; &quot; Lu@@ ci@@ l@@ le B@@ all ke@@ pt us l@@ augh@@ ing through the ri@@ se of social con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness in the 6@@ 0s ."
"M@@ au@@ de F@@ in@@ d@@ l@@ ay , the epi@@ t@@ ome of the ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent 19@@ 7@@ 0s , who t@@ ac@@ k@@ led ab@@ or@@ tion , di@@ v@@ or@@ ce , even men@@ op@@ a@@ use on T@@ V ."
"The 19@@ 8@@ 0s , our first cou@@ g@@ ar was given to us in the form of A@@ le@@ x@@ is C@@ ar@@ r@@ ing@@ ton ."
M@@ ur@@ ph@@ y B@@ row@@ n took on a vice pre@@ si@@ dent when she took on the idea of single par@@ en@@ th@@ o@@ od .
"This era &apos;s mo@@ m , B@@ ree V@@ an de K@@ am@@ p ."
"Now I don &apos;t know if this is the de@@ vi@@ l or the ang@@ el sitting on our con@@ science , sitting on tele@@ vision &apos;s sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders , but I do know that I absolu@@ tely love this image ."
"So to you all , the women of TE@@ D@@ W@@ om@@ en , the men of TE@@ D@@ W@@ om@@ en , the global aud@@ ien@@ ces of TE@@ D@@ W@@ om@@ en , th@@ ank you for le@@ tting me present my idea about the con@@ science of tele@@ vision ."
But let me also th@@ ank the incredible cre@@ at@@ ors who get up every@@ day to put their ideas on our tele@@ vision scre@@ ens throu@@ gh@@ out all these ages of tele@@ vision .
"They give it life on tele@@ vision , for sure , but it &apos;s you as vie@@ w@@ ers , through your colle@@ ctive social con@@ scien@@ ces , that give it life , lon@@ ge@@ vity , power or not ."
So th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause )
"Well we all know the World Wi@@ de W@@ e@@ b has absolu@@ tely trans@@ form@@ ed publi@@ sh@@ ing , bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st@@ ing , comm@@ er@@ ce and social conne@@ cti@@ vity , but where did it all come from ?"
"And I &apos;ll quot@@ e three people : V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h , D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ bar@@ t and T@@ im B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ Le@@ e ."
So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
This is V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h .
V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h was the U.@@ S. government &apos;s ch@@ ie@@ f scienti@@ fic ad@@ vi@@ s@@ er during the war .
"And in 19@@ 4@@ 5 , he publi@@ shed an arti@@ cle in a mag@@ az@@ ine called At@@ lan@@ tic M@@ on@@ th@@ ly ."
And the arti@@ cle was called &quot; &quot; A@@ s We M@@ ay Th@@ in@@ k . &quot; &quot; And what V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h was saying was the way we use information is bro@@ k@@ en .
We don &apos;t work in terms of li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies and cat@@ al@@ o@@ g systems and so for@@ th .
The brain works by as@@ so@@ ci@@ ation .
"Wi@@ th one i@@ tem in its thought , it s@@ na@@ ps in@@ stan@@ tly to the next i@@ tem ."
And the way information is stru@@ ctu@@ red is tot@@ ally in@@ cap@@ able of ke@@ e@@ ping up with this process .
"And so he su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed a mach@@ ine , and he called it the me@@ me@@ x ."
"And the me@@ me@@ x would lin@@ k information , one piece of information to a re@@ lated piece of information and so for@@ th ."
Now this was in 19@@ 4@@ 5 .
A computer in those days was something the se@@ cre@@ t ser@@ vi@@ ces used to use for c@@ od@@ e bre@@ aking .
And no@@ body knew anything about it .
So this was before the computer was inv@@ en@@ ted .
And he pro@@ posed this mach@@ ine called the me@@ me@@ x .
"And he had a pl@@ at@@ form where you lin@@ ked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will ."
"So sp@@ in@@ ning forward , one of the guys who read this arti@@ cle was a guy called D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ bar@@ t , and he was a U.@@ S. A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce offi@@ cer ."
And he was re@@ ading it in their li@@ br@@ ary in the F@@ ar E@@ ast .
"And he was so inspi@@ red by this arti@@ cle , it kind of dire@@ cted the rest of his life ."
"And by the mi@@ d-@@ 6@@ 0s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the St@@ an@@ for@@ d R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch L@@ a@@ b in C@@ alifor@@ nia ."
He built a system .
"The system was desig@@ ned to au@@ g@@ ment human inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence , it was called ."
"And in a pre@@ mon@@ i@@ tion of today &apos;s world of cl@@ ou@@ d compu@@ ting and so@@ f@@ twar@@ es of ser@@ vice , his system was called N@@ L@@ S for o@@ N@@ -@@ L@@ ine S@@ yst@@ em ."
And this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ bar@@ t .
He was gi@@ ving a pres@@ ent@@ ation at the F@@ all Jo@@ int C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter Con@@ fer@@ ence in 19@@ 6@@ 8 .
"What he show@@ ed — he s@@ at on a st@@ age like this , and he de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated this system ."
He had his head mi@@ c like I &apos;ve got .
And he works this system .
"And you can see , he &apos;s working between do@@ cu@@ ments and gra@@ phi@@ cs and so for@@ th ."
"And he &apos;s dri@@ ving it all with this pl@@ at@@ form here , with a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ fin@@ ger ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard and the world &apos;s first computer m@@ ou@@ se , which he speci@@ ally desig@@ ned in order to do this system ."
So this is where the m@@ ou@@ se came from as well .
So this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ bar@@ t .
The t@@ rou@@ ble with D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ bar@@ t &apos;s system was that the compu@@ ters in those days cost se@@ ver@@ al million po@@ un@@ ds .
"So for a per@@ s@@ onal computer , a few million po@@ un@@ ds was like having a per@@ s@@ onal je@@ t pl@@ ane ; it wasn &apos;t really very prac@@ tical ."
"But sp@@ in on to the 8@@ 0s when per@@ s@@ onal compu@@ ters did ar@@ ri@@ ve , then there was room for this kind of system on per@@ s@@ onal compu@@ ters ."
"And my company , O@@ W@@ L built a system called G@@ u@@ i@@ de for the A@@ pp@@ le M@@ ac@@ in@@ to@@ sh ."
And we deli@@ vered the world &apos;s first hy@@ per@@ te@@ xt system .
And this began to get a head of ste@@ am .
"A@@ pp@@ le in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced a thing called H@@ y@@ per@@ C@@ ard , and they made a bit of a f@@ us@@ s about it ."
They had a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ p@@ age su@@ pp@@ le@@ ment in the W@@ all St@@ re@@ et J@@ our@@ na@@ l the day it la@@ un@@ ched .
The mag@@ az@@ ines started to co@@ ver it .
By@@ te mag@@ az@@ ine and C@@ om@@ muni@@ c@@ ations at the A@@ C@@ M had spe@@ cial issu@@ es co@@ ver@@ ing hy@@ per@@ te@@ xt .
We develo@@ ped a P@@ C ver@@ sion of this produ@@ ct as well as the M@@ ac@@ in@@ to@@ sh ver@@ sion .
And our P@@ C ver@@ sion became quite mat@@ ure .
These are some exam@@ ples of this system in action in the l@@ ate 8@@ 0s .
"You were able to deli@@ ver do@@ cu@@ ments , were able to do it over net@@ works ."
We develo@@ ped a system such that it had a mark@@ up language based on h@@ t@@ m@@ l .
We called it h@@ m@@ l : hy@@ per@@ te@@ xt mark@@ up language .
"And the system was cap@@ able of doing very , very large do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ation systems over computer net@@ works ."
So I took this system to a tra@@ de show in V@@ er@@ sa@@ il@@ les ne@@ ar Par@@ is in l@@ ate N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber 199@@ 0 .
"And I was appro@@ ach@@ ed by a nice young man called T@@ im B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ Le@@ e who said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you I@@ an R@@ it@@ ch@@ ie ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his pro@@ posed system called the World Wi@@ de W@@ e@@ b ."
"And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pre@@ ten@@ ti@@ ous name , es@@ pe@@ cially since the whole system ran on his computer in his offi@@ ce ."
But he was completely con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that his World Wi@@ de W@@ e@@ b would take over the world one day .
"And he tr@@ ied to per@@ su@@ ade me to write the b@@ row@@ s@@ er for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any gra@@ phi@@ cs or f@@ on@@ ts or la@@ y@@ out or anything ; it was just pla@@ in te@@ xt ."
"I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from C@@ E@@ R@@ N , he &apos;s not going to do this ."
So we didn &apos;t do it .
"In the next couple of years , the hy@@ per@@ te@@ xt community didn &apos;t re@@ cogni@@ ze him either ."
"In 199@@ 2 , his pa@@ per was re@@ je@@ cted for the H@@ y@@ per@@ te@@ xt Con@@ fer@@ ence ."
"In 199@@ 3 , there was a table at the con@@ fer@@ ence in Se@@ at@@ tle , and a guy called Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ ess@@ en was de@@ mon@@ str@@ ating his little b@@ row@@ s@@ er for the World Wi@@ de W@@ e@@ b ."
"And I saw it , and I thought , ye@@ p , that &apos;s it ."
"And the very next year , in 199@@ 4 , we had the con@@ fer@@ ence here in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh , and I had no op@@ posi@@ tion in having T@@ im B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ Le@@ e as the ke@@ y@@ not@@ e spe@@ ak@@ er ."
So that pu@@ ts me in pretty il@@ lu@@ stri@@ ous company .
There was a guy called D@@ i@@ ck R@@ owe who was at De@@ c@@ ca Re@@ cor@@ ds and turned down The Be@@ at@@ les .
"There was a guy called G@@ ary K@@ il@@ d@@ all who went fl@@ ying his pl@@ ane when I@@ B@@ M came looking for an oper@@ ating system for the I@@ B@@ M P@@ C , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see Bi@@ ll G@@ ates ."
"And the 12 publi@@ sh@@ ers who turned down J@@ .@@ K@@ . R@@ ow@@ ling &apos;s H@@ ar@@ ry Pot@@ ter , I gu@@ ess ."
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ ess@@ en who wro@@ te the world &apos;s first b@@ row@@ s@@ er for the World Wi@@ de W@@ e@@ b ."
"And ac@@ cor@@ ding to F@@ or@@ tu@@ ne mag@@ az@@ ine , he &apos;s wor@@ th 7@@ 00 million dollars ."
But is he happy ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
"In 199@@ 4 , I wal@@ ked into a pri@@ son in C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia , and I met a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y who had been tor@@ tu@@ red and was den@@ ied ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l ."
"And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundre@@ ds of let@@ ters I had wri@@ t@@ ten for poli@@ tical pri@@ son@@ ers , that I would never have wri@@ t@@ ten a let@@ ter for him , because he was not a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y who had done something important for any@@ body ."
He was not a poli@@ tical pri@@ son@@ er .
He was a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y who had sto@@ le@@ n a bi@@ cy@@ cle .
"What I also realized at that point was that it was not only C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia , but of the 1@@ 1@@ 3 develo@@ ping countries that tor@@ ture , 9@@ 3 of these countries have all pas@@ sed l@@ aw@@ s that say you have a right to a la@@ wy@@ er and you have a right not to be tor@@ tu@@ red ."
And what I re@@ cogni@@ zed was that there was an incredible win@@ do@@ w of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end tor@@ ture as an inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ative to@@ ol .
"We often think of tor@@ ture as being poli@@ tical tor@@ ture or re@@ ser@@ ved for just the wor@@ st , but , in fact , 9@@ 5 percent of tor@@ ture today is not for poli@@ tical pri@@ son@@ ers ."
"It is for people who are in bro@@ k@@ en@@ -@@ down leg@@ al systems , and un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely because tor@@ ture is the che@@ ap@@ est form of inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ation — it &apos;s che@@ ap@@ er than having a leg@@ al system , che@@ ap@@ er than having a la@@ wy@@ er and early ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l — it is what happens most of the time ."
"I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a deci@@ sion , to come together and end tor@@ ture as an inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ative to@@ ol in our li@@ fe@@ time , but it will requi@@ re three things ."
"F@@ ir@@ st is the tra@@ ining , em@@ power@@ ment , and conne@@ ction of def@@ en@@ ders wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
The second is in@@ sur@@ ing that there is system@@ atic early ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l .
And the third is com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment .
"So in the year 2@@ 000 , I began to won@@ der , what if we came together ?"
C@@ ould we do something for these 9@@ 3 countries ?
And I f@@ oun@@ ded Inter@@ national Bri@@ d@@ ges to Ju@@ sti@@ ce which has a speci@@ fic mis@@ sion of ending tor@@ ture as an inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ative to@@ ol and im@@ ple@@ ment@@ ing du@@ e process ri@@ ghts in the 9@@ 3 countries by plac@@ ing tra@@ ined la@@ wy@@ ers at an early st@@ age in poli@@ ce st@@ ations and in cour@@ tro@@ oms .
"My first exper@@ ien@@ ces , though , did come from C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia , and at the time I remember first coming to C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia and there were , in 199@@ 4 , still less than 10 at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys in the country because the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge had kil@@ led them all ."
"And even 20 years later , there was only 10 la@@ wy@@ ers in the country , so con@@ sequ@@ ently you &apos;d walk into a pri@@ son and not only would you me@@ et 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ ys , you &apos;d me@@ et women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; W@@ om@@ en would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my h@@ us@@ b@@ and com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted a cri@@ me , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no ru@@ le of la@@ w ."
"The first group of def@@ en@@ ders came together and I still remember , as I was tra@@ ining , I said , &quot; O@@ kay , what do you do for an inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ation ? &quot;"
"And there was sil@@ ence in the clas@@ s , and finally one woman sto@@ od up , &#91; in@@ au@@ di@@ ble name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ re@@ w , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teach@@ er . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have def@@ en@@ ded more than a hundre@@ d people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ation , because they all come with con@@ f@@ es@@ sions . &quot; &quot; And we tal@@ ked about , as a clas@@ s , the fact that number one , the con@@ f@@ es@@ sions might not be reli@@ able , but number two , we did not want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the poli@@ ce to keep doing this , es@@ pe@@ cially as it was now against the la@@ w ."
And it took a lot of cou@@ ra@@ ge for these def@@ en@@ ders to deci@@ de that they would beg@@ in to stand up and sup@@ port each other in im@@ ple@@ ment@@ ing these l@@ aw@@ s .
"And I still remember the first c@@ ases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would sup@@ port her , and the ju@@ d@@ ges ke@@ pt saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the ex@@ act same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfe@@ ct case came , and it was a woman who was a ve@@ ge@@ table sel@@ ler , she was sitting outside of a house ."
"S@@ he said she actually saw the person run out who she thin@@ ks sto@@ le whatever the je@@ wel@@ ry was , but the poli@@ ce came , they got her , there was nothing on her ."
She was pre@@ gn@@ ant at the time . She had ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te bur@@ ns on her . She &apos;d mi@@ sc@@ ar@@ ried .
"And when they brought her case to the ju@@ dge , for the first time he sto@@ od up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evi@@ dence ex@@ cept for your tor@@ ture con@@ f@@ es@@ sion and you will be rele@@ as@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And the def@@ en@@ ders began to take c@@ ases over and over again and you will see , they have ste@@ p by ste@@ p began to change the course of history in C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia ."
But C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia is not alone .
"I used to think , well is it C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia ?"
O@@ r is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
"In Bu@@ ru@@ n@@ d@@ i I wal@@ ked into a pri@@ son and it wasn &apos;t a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y , it was an 8@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y for ste@@ al@@ ing a mo@@ bi@@ le phone ."
"O@@ r a woman , I pi@@ cked up her b@@ aby , really cu@@ te b@@ aby , I said &quot; &quot; Y@@ our b@@ aby is so cu@@ te . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a b@@ aby , she was three ."
"And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was ac@@ c@@ used of ste@@ al@@ ing two di@@ a@@ per@@ s and an i@@ ro@@ n for her b@@ aby and still had been in pri@@ son ."
"And when I wal@@ ked up to the pri@@ son dire@@ ctor , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out ."
"A ju@@ dge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , we can talk about it , but look at my pri@@ son . E@@ igh@@ ty percent of the two thous@@ and people here are without a la@@ wy@@ er . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So la@@ wy@@ ers began to cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously stand up together to organi@@ ze a system where they can take c@@ ases ."
"But we realized that it &apos;s not only the tra@@ ining of the la@@ wy@@ ers , but the conne@@ ction of the la@@ wy@@ ers that makes a difference ."
"For example , in C@@ am@@ bod@@ ia , it was that &#91; in@@ au@@ di@@ ble name &#93; did not go alone but she had 2@@ 4 la@@ wy@@ ers with her who sto@@ od up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fre@@ sh wind in the des@@ er@@ t when we can come together . &quot; &quot; O@@ r in Z@@ im@@ b@@ ab@@ we , where I remember In@@ no@@ cent , after coming out of a pri@@ son where everybody sto@@ od up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a la@@ wy@@ er , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a tra@@ ining together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people mu@@ m@@ b@@ lin@@ g@@ "
"@@ and gru@@ m@@ b@@ ling — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create ju@@ sti@@ ce because we do not have the re@@ sources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the l@@ ack of re@@ sources is never an ex@@ c@@ use for in@@ ju@@ sti@@ ce . &quot; &quot; And with that , he suc@@ cess@@ fully organiz@@ ed 6@@ 8 la@@ wy@@ ers who have been system@@ ati@@ cally taking the c@@ ases ."
"The key that we see , though , is tra@@ ining and then early ac@@ cess ."
"I was re@@ cent@@ ly in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , and was inspi@@ red to me@@ et with another group of la@@ wy@@ ers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , look , we don &apos;t have poli@@ ce on the stre@@ ets now . The poli@@ ce are one of the ma@@ in reas@@ ons why we had the re@@ v@@ olution . They were tor@@ tur@@ ing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been ten@@ s of mi@@ llions of dollars that have re@@ cent@@ ly gone in to the develo@@ pment of the leg@@ al system here ."
"What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the develo@@ pment ag@@ en@@ cies , and they were tra@@ ining pro@@ secu@@ t@@ ors and ju@@ d@@ ges , which is the nor@@ mal bi@@ as , as op@@ posed to def@@ en@@ ders ."
And they show@@ ed me a man@@ u@@ al which actually was an ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent man@@ u@@ al .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m g@@ on@@ na cop@@ y this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . L@@ a@@ wy@@ ers can come at the poli@@ ce st@@ ation . It was perfe@@ ct ."
Pro@@ secu@@ t@@ ors were perfe@@ ct@@ ly tra@@ ined .
"But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the pro@@ secu@@ tor &apos;s offi@@ ce , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pa@@ use , they said , &quot; They had been tor@@ tu@@ red . &quot;"
"So the pie@@ ces are , not only the tra@@ ining of the la@@ wy@@ ers , but us fin@@ ding a way to system@@ ati@@ cally im@@ ple@@ ment early ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l , because they are the sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard in the system for people who are being tor@@ tu@@ red ."
"And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the fact that it sounds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , o@@ kay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it sounds big ."
And there are many reas@@ ons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of cre@@ ating mi@@ rac@@ les because of their com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment .
"It &apos;s not only In@@ no@@ cent , who I told you about in Z@@ im@@ b@@ ab@@ we , but def@@ en@@ ders all over the world who are looking for these pie@@ ces ."
"We have a program called Ju@@ sti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , and we realized there are people that are cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous and want to do things , but how can we sup@@ port them ?"
So it &apos;s an on@@ line con@@ test where it &apos;s only five thous@@ and dollars if you come up with and in@@ no@@ v@@ ative way of im@@ ple@@ ment@@ ing ju@@ sti@@ ce .
"And there are 30 Ju@@ sti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers throu@@ gh@@ out the world , from S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ ka to S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and to the D@@ R@@ C , who with five thous@@ and dollars do amazing things , through S@@ M@@ S progra@@ ms , through par@@ ale@@ g@@ al progra@@ ms , through whatever they can do ."
"And it &apos;s not only these Ju@@ sti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , but people we cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously see figure out who their net@@ works are and how they can move it forward ."
"So in China , for in@@ stance , great l@@ aw@@ s came out where it says poli@@ ce cannot tor@@ ture people or they will be pu@@ ni@@ shed ."
"And I was sitting side by side with one of our very cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous la@@ wy@@ ers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is im@@ ple@@ men@@ ted ?"
"This is fanta@@ stic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s o@@ kay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on De@@ c@@ em@@ ber 4 , he organiz@@ ed three thous@@ and mem@@ bers of the Y@@ outh C@@ om@@ muni@@ st Le@@ ag@@ ue , from 14 of the top la@@ w scho@@ ols , who organiz@@ ed themselves , develo@@ ped post@@ ers with the new l@@ aw@@ s , and went to the poli@@ ce st@@ ations and began what he says is a n@@ on-@@ viol@@ ent leg@@ al re@@ v@@ olution to prote@@ ct ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ri@@ ghts ."
So I tal@@ ked about the fact that we need to tra@@ in and sup@@ port def@@ en@@ ders .
We need to system@@ ati@@ cally im@@ ple@@ ment early ac@@ cess to coun@@ se@@ l .
But the third and most important thing is that we make a com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment to this .
"And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wil@@ d@@ ly ide@@ ali@@ stic ."
"N@@ ever going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end s@@ la@@ very , or end a@@ par@@ the@@ id ."
It began with a small group of people who decided they would comm@@ it .
"Now , there &apos;s one of our fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te po@@ em@@ s from the def@@ en@@ ders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; T@@ ake cou@@ ra@@ ge friends , the ro@@ ad is often long , the pat@@ h is never clear , and the st@@ ak@@ es are very high , but de@@ ep down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to sup@@ port not only def@@ en@@ ders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towar@@ ds it , we can end tor@@ ture as an inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ative to@@ ol ."
"I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . F@@ ir@@ st of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of V@@ i@@ sh@@ na , who actually was my in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation for star@@ ting Inter@@ national Bri@@ d@@ ges to Ju@@ sti@@ ce ."
"@@ V@@ i@@ sh@@ na was a 4@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y when I met him who was born in a C@@ am@@ bod@@ i@@ an pri@@ son in K@@ and@@ al Pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce . But because he was born in the pri@@ son , everybody lo@@ ved him , inclu@@ ding the gu@@ ar@@ ds , so he was the only one who was allow@@ ed to come in and out of the bar@@ s ."
"So , you know , there &apos;s bar@@ s . And by the time that V@@ i@@ sh@@ na was getting bi@@ g@@ ger , which means what gets bi@@ g@@ ger ? Y@@ our head gets bi@@ g@@ ger ."
"So he would come to the first b@@ ar , the second b@@ ar and then the third b@@ ar , and then really s@@ low@@ ly move his head so he could f@@ it through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would gra@@ b my p@@ in@@ kie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visi@@ t ."
"You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visi@@ t all 1@@ 5@@ 6 pri@@ son@@ ers . And I would li@@ ft him , and he would put his fin@@ g@@ ers through ."
"O@@ r if they were dar@@ k cells , it was like i@@ ro@@ n cor@@ ru@@ g@@ ated , and he would put his fin@@ g@@ ers through ."
"And most of the pri@@ son@@ ers said that he was their gre@@ at@@ est jo@@ y and their su@@ n@@ sh@@ ine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s V@@ i@@ sh@@ na . He &apos;s a 4@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ y ."
"He was born in a pri@@ son with almost nothing , no materi@@ al go@@ ods , but he had a sense of his own her@@ o@@ ic jour@@ ney , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; P@@ rob@@ ably I can &apos;t do everything ."
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
"And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I th@@ ank you for having the pro@@ p@@ he@@ tic imag@@ in@@ ation to imagine the sha@@ ping of a new world with us together , and in@@ vi@@ te you into this jour@@ ney with us ."

"So , it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous why the ideas that make up your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view are c@@ ru@@ cial ."
"You need them to be as reli@@ able as possible — a gu@@ i@@ de , to the sc@@ ary but wonderful real world out there ."
"Now , different people &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ vie@@ ws can be dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally different ."
"For example , how does your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view re@@ act when you see this image : ( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ ali@@ a M@@ og@@ a@@ h@@ ed : What do you think when you look at me ?"
"&quot; &quot; A woman of fai@@ th , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exper@@ t , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a si@@ ster &quot; &quot; ?"
"O@@ r &quot; &quot; op@@ pres@@ sed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bra@@ in@@ wa@@ shed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ st &quot; &quot; ?"
"CA : Wh@@ atever your answer , there are mi@@ llions of people out there who would re@@ act very differ@@ ently ."
So that &apos;s why ideas really matter .
"If communi@@ c@@ ated pro@@ per@@ ly , they &apos;re cap@@ able of chang@@ ing , fore@@ ver , how someone thin@@ ks about the world , and sha@@ ping their ac@@ tions both now and well into the future ."
I@@ de@@ as are the most powerful force sha@@ ping human culture .
"So if you ac@@ cept that your number one t@@ ask as a spe@@ ak@@ er is to build an idea inside the min@@ ds of your audience , here are four gu@@ ide@@ lin@@ es for how you should go about that t@@ ask : One , lim@@ it your talk to just one major idea ."
"I@@ de@@ as are comple@@ x things ; you need to s@@ las@@ h back your cont@@ ent so that you can fo@@ cus on the single idea you &apos;re most pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate about , and give yourself a ch@@ ance to expla@@ in that one thing pro@@ per@@ ly ."
"You have to give con@@ te@@ xt , share exam@@ ples , make it vi@@ vi@@ d ."
"So pi@@ ck one idea , and make it the throu@@ gh@@ -@@ line ru@@ n@@ ning through your entire talk , so that everything you say lin@@ ks back to it in some way ."
"T@@ wo , give your list@@ en@@ ers a reason to care ."
"Be@@ fore you can start building things inside the min@@ ds of your audience , you have to get their per@@ mis@@ sion to wel@@ come you in ."
And the ma@@ in to@@ ol to ach@@ ie@@ ve that ?
C@@ u@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty .
S@@ ti@@ r your audience &apos;s cu@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty .
"U@@ se in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing , pro@@ v@@ oc@@ ative questions to iden@@ ti@@ fy why something doesn &apos;t make sense and needs expla@@ ining ."
"If you can re@@ ve@@ al a dis@@ conne@@ ction in someone &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ view , they &apos;ll feel the need to bri@@ dge that know@@ le@@ dge ga@@ p ."
"And once you &apos;ve sp@@ ar@@ ked that de@@ si@@ re , it will be so much e@@ as@@ ier to start building your idea ."
"Th@@ ree , build your idea , piece by piece , out of con@@ cep@@ ts that your audience already under@@ stan@@ ds ."
"You use the power of language to we@@ a@@ ve together con@@ cep@@ ts that already exi@@ st in your list@@ en@@ ers &apos; min@@ ds — but not your language , their language ."
You start where they are .
The spe@@ ak@@ ers often for@@ get that many of the terms and con@@ cep@@ ts they live with are completely un@@ fami@@ li@@ ar to their aud@@ ien@@ ces .
"Now , me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ors can play a c@@ ru@@ cial ro@@ le in show@@ ing how the pie@@ ces f@@ it together , because they re@@ ve@@ al the de@@ si@@ red sha@@ pe of the pat@@ ter@@ n , based on an idea that the list@@ en@@ er already under@@ stan@@ ds ."
"For example , when J@@ en@@ ni@@ f@@ er K@@ a@@ h@@ n wanted to expla@@ in the incredible new bi@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy called C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R , she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s as if , for the first time , you had a word pro@@ cess@@ or to ed@@ it DNA ."
"C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R allow@@ s you to cut and pa@@ ste gen@@ e@@ tic information really e@@ a@@ si@@ ly . &quot; &quot; Now , a vi@@ vi@@ d ex@@ plan@@ ation like that deli@@ ver@@ s a s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying a@@ h@@ a moment as it s@@ na@@ ps into place in our min@@ ds ."
"It &apos;s important , ther@@ e@@ fore , to test your talk on tru@@ st@@ ed friends , and find out which par@@ ts they get con@@ f@@ used by ."
"F@@ our , here &apos;s the fin@@ al ti@@ p : M@@ ake your idea wor@@ th sh@@ aring ."
"B@@ y that I mean , ask yourself the question : &quot; Wh@@ o does this idea b@@ en@@ ef@@ it ? &quot;"
And I need you to be hon@@ est with the answer .
"If the idea only ser@@ ves you or your organiz@@ ation , then , I &apos;m sor@@ ry to say , it &apos;s probably not wor@@ th sh@@ aring ."
The audience will see right through you .
"C@@ an I ask you to ple@@ ase re@@ call a time when you really lo@@ ved something — a movie , an al@@ bu@@ m , a s@@ ong or a book — and you re@@ com@@ men@@ ded it wh@@ o@@ le@@ hear@@ te@@ d@@ ly to someone you also really li@@ ked , and you anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed that re@@ action , you wai@@ ted for it , and it came back , and the person h@@ ated it ?"
"So , by way of in@@ tro@@ du@@ ction , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school mat@@ h ."
"I se@@ ll a produ@@ ct to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ ced by la@@ w to bu@@ y it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a lo@@ sing pro@@ posi@@ tion ."
"So there &apos;s a us@@ e@@ ful ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pe about students that I see , a us@@ e@@ ful ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pe about you all ."
"I could give you guys an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would expe@@ ct no high@@ er than a 25 percent pas@@ s r@@ ate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call mat@@ h education in the U.@@ S. today .
"To start with , I &apos;d like to bre@@ ak mat@@ h down into two c@@ ate@@ gor@@ ies ."
One is compu@@ tation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ got@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ tor@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ati@@ cs with le@@ ading co@@ ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ ts gre@@ ater than one ."
"This stuff is also really e@@ asy to re@@ learn , provi@@ ded you have a really stron@@ g gro@@ un@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the app@@ lic@@ ation of mat@@ h pro@@ cess@@ es to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal fie@@ l@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.@@ S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ ami@@ ty for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a mat@@ h teach@@ er ."
"So first , five sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s that you &apos;re doing mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your clas@@ s@@ room ."
One is a l@@ ack of ini@@ ti@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ is@@ h your le@@ cture blo@@ ck and im@@ medi@@ ately you have five h@@ ands going up as@@ king you to re@@ -@@ expla@@ in the entire thing at their des@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents l@@ ack per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
"They l@@ ack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find yourself re@@ -@@ expla@@ ining con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ale ."
"There &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ sion to word problems , which descri@@ be@@ s 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the for@@ mu@@ la to app@@ ly in that situ@@ ation .
This is really de@@ stru@@ ctive .
"D@@ avi@@ d M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ ator of &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ wood &quot; &quot; and other amazing T@@ V shows , has a really good descri@@ ption for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary dra@@ ma , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fi@@ ll their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ wo and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ re@@ spe@@ ct , it sha@@ p@@ es the neu@@ ral pa@@ th@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they expe@@ ct simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an im@@ pat@@ ience with ir@@ re@@ solution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re im@@ patien@@ t with things that don &apos;t re@@ sol@@ ve quickly ."
"You expe@@ ct si@@ t@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ zed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three comm@@ er@@ cial bre@@ ak@@ s and a l@@ au@@ gh tr@@ ack ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and wel@@ l-@@ being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our te@@ x@@ t@@ boo@@ ks — parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly mas@@ s@@ -@@ ad@@ op@@ ted te@@ x@@ t@@ boo@@ ks — te@@ ach mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and patien@@ t problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s fun@@ cti@@ on@@ ally e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ wo and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and cal@@ ling it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all seri@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a physi@@ cs te@@ x@@ t@@ book .
It ap@@ pl@@ ies equ@@ ally to mat@@ h .
"N@@ oti@@ ce , first of all here , that you have exactly three pie@@ ces of information there , each of which will figure into a for@@ mu@@ la some@@ where , ev@@ en@@ tually , which the stud@@ ent will then compu@@ te ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the given information in adv@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ p@@ lu@@ s of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have su@@ f@@ fi@@ cient information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the te@@ x@@ t@@ book , I think , know@@ s how it &apos;s ha@@ m@@ str@@ ing@@ ing students because , wat@@ ch this , this is the prac@@ ti@@ ce problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tu@@ al problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ wa@@ pping out num@@ bers and t@@ we@@ aking the con@@ te@@ xt a little bit ."
"And if the stud@@ ent still doesn &apos;t re@@ cogni@@ ze the st@@ am@@ p this was mo@@ l@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ fully expla@@ ins to you what sam@@ ple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the for@@ mu@@ la ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , pas@@ s this particular uni@@ t without know@@ ing any physi@@ cs , just know@@ ing how to dec@@ od@@ e a te@@ x@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a sha@@ me ."
So I can di@@ ag@@ no@@ se the problem a little more speci@@ fi@@ cally in mat@@ h .
Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about de@@ fin@@ ing ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ pe using a ski li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers , and I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers and , parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pres@@ sed together and pre@@ sen@@ ted to the stud@@ ent all at once , how that cre@@ ates this im@@ patien@@ t problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll def@@ ine them here : You have the vi@@ su@@ al .
"You also have the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal structure , talking about g@@ ri@@ ds , meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , la@@ be@@ ls , poin@@ ts , ax@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ ste@@ ps , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which se@@ ction is the ste@@ e@@ p@@ est ."
So I hope you can see .
"I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compe@@ l@@ ling question , a compe@@ l@@ ling answer , but we &apos;re pa@@ ving a smo@@ ot@@ h , stra@@ ight pat@@ h from one to the other and con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lat@@ ing our students for how well they can ste@@ p over the small c@@ rac@@ ks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patien@@ t problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the vi@@ su@@ al , and I im@@ medi@@ ately ask the question : Wh@@ ich se@@ ction is the ste@@ e@@ p@@ est ?"
And this star@@ ts convers@@ ation because the vi@@ su@@ al is created in such a way where you can def@@ end two ans@@ w@@ ers .
"So you get people ar@@ gu@@ ing against each other , friend ver@@ su@@ s friend , in pa@@ ir@@ s , jour@@ n@@ al@@ ing , whatever ."
And then ev@@ en@@ tually we realize it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the sk@@ ie@@ r in the low@@ er le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the sk@@ ie@@ r just ab@@ o@@ ve the mi@@ d line .
"And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D la@@ be@@ ls to talk about them more e@@ a@@ si@@ ly ."
"And then as we start to def@@ ine what does ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments to really nar@@ row it down , speci@@ fi@@ cally what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ row down that ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal structure ."
"The mat@@ h ser@@ ves the convers@@ ation , the convers@@ ation doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the mat@@ h ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 clas@@ ses are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ pe , ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then develo@@ p those sub@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"D@@ o you guys see how this , right here , com@@ par@@ ed to that — which one cre@@ ates that patien@@ t problem sol@@ ving , that mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been obvi@@ ous in my prac@@ ti@@ ce , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ ie@@ ld the flo@@ or here for a second to E@@ inste@@ in , who , I believe , has pa@@ id his du@@ es ."
"He tal@@ ked about the for@@ mul@@ ation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my prac@@ ti@@ ce , in the U.@@ S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve them in the for@@ mul@@ ation of the problem ."
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fa@@ ir@@ ly compe@@ l@@ ling ele@@ ments of problems like this from my te@@ x@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that sup@@ por@@ ts mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and patien@@ t problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water t@@ ank .
The question is : How long will it take you to fi@@ ll it up ?
"F@@ ir@@ st things first , we e@@ li@@ min@@ ate all the sub@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents have to develo@@ p those , they have to for@@ mul@@ ate those ."
And then noti@@ ce that all the information wri@@ t@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"N@@ one of it &apos;s a di@@ strac@@ tor , so we lo@@ se that ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents need to deci@@ de , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the color of the val@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; Su@@ ch an under@@ re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted question in mat@@ h cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m .
So now we have a water t@@ ank .
How long will it take you to fi@@ ll it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or cli@@ p art that you so often see in te@@ x@@ t@@ boo@@ ks , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to fi@@ ll it up ?
"And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone fil@@ ling it up ."
"And it &apos;s fil@@ ling up s@@ low@@ ly , ag@@ oni@@ z@@ ing@@ ly s@@ low@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents are looking at their wat@@ ch@@ es , rol@@ ling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to fi@@ ll up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ i@@ ted the ho@@ ok , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the in@@ tr@@ o , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a convers@@ ation about mat@@ h because someone else has the for@@ mu@@ la ; someone else know@@ s how to work the for@@ mu@@ la better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stud@@ ent is on a level playing fie@@ ld of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion ."
"E@@ very@@ one &apos;s fil@@ led something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cally and convers@@ ati@@ on@@ ally in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated jo@@ ining the convers@@ ation ."
"We put na@@ mes on the bo@@ ard , att@@ ach them to gu@@ ess@@ es , and kids have b@@ ou@@ ght in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve descri@@ bed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better par@@ ts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teach@@ er &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion ."
"We , instead , just wat@@ ch the end of the movie ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ ore@@ tical mode@@ ls that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teach@@ er &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s sc@@ ary to talk about sources of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ ore@@ tical does not mat@@ ch up with the prac@@ tical ."
"But those convers@@ ations have been so val@@ u@@ able , am@@ ong the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ port some really fun g@@ am@@ es with students who come pre@@ -@@ in@@ stal@@ led with these vi@@ rus@@ es day one of the clas@@ s .
"These are the kids who now , one se@@ me@@ ster in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , tot@@ ally new , tot@@ ally fore@@ ig@@ n , and they &apos;ll have a convers@@ ation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun ."
"We &apos;re no longer a@@ verse to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ de@@ fin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated by mat@@ h , because we &apos;re s@@ low@@ ly re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing what mat@@ h is ."
This has been a lot of fun .
"I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge mat@@ h teach@@ ers I talk to to use mul@@ ti@@ media , because it br@@ ings the real world into your clas@@ s@@ room in high re@@ solution and full color ; to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge stud@@ ent in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion for that level playing fie@@ ld ; to ask the shor@@ test question you possi@@ bly can and let those more speci@@ fic questions come out in convers@@ ation ; to let students build the problem , because E@@ inste@@ in said so ; and to finally , in tot@@ al , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the te@@ x@@ t@@ book is hel@@ ping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation , for patien@@ t problem sol@@ ving and mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an amazing time to be a mat@@ h teach@@ er right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high-@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m in our front po@@ ck@@ et .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fa@@ ir@@ ly che@@ a@@ p , and the to@@ ols to di@@ stri@@ bu@@ te it fre@@ ely under open li@@ cen@@ ses has also never been che@@ ap@@ er or more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a video ser@@ ies on my blo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vie@@ ws in two weeks ."
"I get e@@ ma@@ il@@ s still from teach@@ ers in countries I &apos;ve never visi@@ ted saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ ah . We had a good convers@@ ation about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wo@@ w ."
"I put this problem on my blo@@ g re@@ cent@@ ly : In a gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e , which line do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 1@@ 9 i@@ tem@@ s or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one i@@ tem@@ s ."
"And the lin@@ e@@ ar mode@@ ling inv@@ olved in that was some good stuff for my clas@@ s@@ room , but it ev@@ en@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; Go@@ od M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bi@@ zar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ clu@@ de that people , not just students , are really hun@@ g@@ ry for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ lar@@ y for your own in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion .
"So I just really en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , whatever your st@@ ake is in education — whether you &apos;re a stud@@ ent , par@@ ent , teach@@ er , poli@@ cy mak@@ er , whatever — in@@ si@@ st on better mat@@ h cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m ."
We need more patien@@ t problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
"In@@ ter@@ pre@@ ter : P@@ i@@ ano , &quot; &quot; p , &quot; &quot; is my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te musi@@ cal sym@@ bo@@ l ."
It means to play so@@ f@@ tly .
"If you &apos;re playing a musi@@ cal instru@@ ment and you noti@@ ce a &quot; &quot; p &quot; &quot; in the sc@@ ore , you need to play so@@ f@@ ter ."
T@@ wo p &apos;s — even so@@ f@@ ter .
F@@ our p &apos;s — extre@@ me@@ ly so@@ ft .
"This is my d@@ raw@@ ing of a p@@ -@@ t@@ ree , which de@@ mon@@ str@@ ates no matter how many thousands upo@@ n thousands of p &apos;s there may be , you &apos;ll never re@@ ach comple@@ te sil@@ ence ."
That &apos;s my cur@@ r@@ ent defini@@ tion of sil@@ ence : a very ob@@ s@@ cu@@ re sound .
"I &apos;d like to share a little bit about the history of American S@@ ig@@ n L@@ ang@@ u@@ age , A@@ S@@ L , p@@ lu@@ s a bit of my own back@@ ground ."
"F@@ ren@@ ch sig@@ n language was brought to America during the early 1@@ 8@@ 0@@ 0s , and as time went by , mi@@ x@@ ed with local sig@@ ns , it ev@@ olved into the language we know today as A@@ S@@ L ."
So it has a history of about 2@@ 00 years .
"I was born de@@ a@@ f , and I was t@@ au@@ ght to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life ."
And I belie@@ ved it to be true .
"@@ Y@@ et , I realize now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all ."
"S@@ ound was very much a part of my life , really , on my mind every day ."
"As a De@@ a@@ f person living in a world of sound , it &apos;s as if I was living in a fore@@ ig@@ n country , b@@ lin@@ d@@ ly fol@@ low@@ ing its ru@@ les , cu@@ st@@ oms , behavi@@ ors and nor@@ ms without ever questi@@ on@@ ing them ."
So how is it that I understand sound ?
"Well , I wat@@ ch how people be@@ have and re@@ spo@@ nd to sound ."
"You people are like my l@@ ou@@ d@@ spe@@ ak@@ ers , and am@@ pli@@ fy sound ."
I learn and mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r that behavi@@ or .
"A@@ t the same time , I &apos;ve learned that I create sound , and I &apos;ve seen how people re@@ spo@@ nd to me ."
"Th@@ us I &apos;ve learned , for example ..."
&quot; D@@ on &apos;t make too much no@@ ise when you &apos;re e@@ ating from the pot@@ at@@ o@@ -@@ chi@@ p ba@@ g ! &quot;
I &apos;m hy@@ per@@ -@@ vi@@ gi@@ l@@ ant around sound .
"H@@ ence , this d@@ raw@@ ing ."
"T@@ B@@ D , to be decided ."
"T@@ B@@ C , to be contin@@ u@@ ed ."
"T@@ B@@ A , to be an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced ."
And you noti@@ ce the st@@ af@@ f — there are no not@@ es con@@ ta@@ ined in the lin@@ es .
That &apos;s because the lin@@ es already con@@ tain sound through the sub@@ tle s@@ mu@@ d@@ ges and s@@ me@@ ars .
"In De@@ a@@ f culture , movement is e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent to sound ."
This is a sig@@ n for &quot; &quot; st@@ af@@ f &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
A ty@@ pi@@ cal st@@ af@@ f con@@ ta@@ ins five lin@@ es .
"@@ Y@@ et for me , sig@@ ning it with my th@@ um@@ b sti@@ c@@ king up like that doesn &apos;t feel natural ."
"That &apos;s why you &apos;ll noti@@ ce in my d@@ raw@@ ings , I sti@@ ck to four lin@@ es on pa@@ per ."
"P@@ ri@@ or to this time , I had been working as a pain@@ ter ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing this sum@@ m@@ er , I visi@@ ted different mus@@ e@@ um@@ s and gal@@ l@@ ery sp@@ ac@@ es , and as I went from one place to the next , I noti@@ ced there was no vi@@ su@@ al art there ."
"A@@ t that time , sound was tr@@ ending , and this stru@@ ck me ..."
"@@ there was no vi@@ su@@ al art , everything was au@@ di@@ t@@ ory ."
Now sound has come into my art terri@@ t@@ ory .
Is it going to f@@ ur@@ ther di@@ stance me from art ?
I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
I actually know sound .
I know it so well that it doesn &apos;t have to be something just exper@@ ien@@ ced through the ear@@ s .
"It could be felt t@@ actually , or exper@@ ien@@ ced as a vi@@ su@@ al , or even as an idea ."
So I decided to re@@ c@@ la@@ im ow@@ ner@@ ship of sound and to put it into my art prac@@ ti@@ ce .
"And everything that I had been t@@ au@@ ght re@@ gar@@ ding sound , I decided to do away with and un@@ learn ."
I started cre@@ ating a new body of work .
"And when I pre@@ sen@@ ted this to the art community , I was b@@ low@@ n away with the amount of sup@@ port and at@@ ten@@ tion I re@@ cei@@ ved ."
"I realized : sound is like money , power , control — social cur@@ ren@@ cy ."
"In the back of my mind , I &apos;ve always felt that sound was your thing , a hear@@ ing person &apos;s thing ."
"And sound is so powerful that it could either dise@@ m@@ power me and my ar@@ t@@ work , or it could em@@ power me ."
I cho@@ se to be em@@ power@@ ed .
There &apos;s a mas@@ sive culture around spo@@ k@@ en language .
"And just because I don &apos;t use my liter@@ al vo@@ ice to communi@@ cate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a vo@@ ice at all ."
So I need to work with individu@@ als who can sup@@ port me as an equ@@ al and become my vo@@ ice .
"And that way , I &apos;m able to ma@@ in@@ tain rele@@ v@@ an@@ cy in society today ."
"So at school , at work and institu@@ tions , I work with many different A@@ S@@ L inter@@ pre@@ ters ."
And their vo@@ ice be@@ comes my vo@@ ice and iden@@ ti@@ ty .
They help me to be heard .
And their vo@@ i@@ ces h@@ old val@@ ue and cur@@ ren@@ cy .
"I@@ ro@@ ni@@ cally , by bor@@ row@@ ing out their vo@@ i@@ ces , I &apos;m able to ma@@ in@@ tain a tem@@ por@@ ary form of cur@@ ren@@ cy , kind of like taking out a lo@@ an with a very high inter@@ est r@@ ate ."
"If I didn &apos;t contin@@ ue this prac@@ ti@@ ce , I feel that I could just f@@ ade off into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on and not ma@@ in@@ tain any form of social cur@@ ren@@ cy ."
"So with sound as my new art medi@@ um , I de@@ l@@ ved into the world of music ."
And I was sur@@ pri@@ sed to see the si@@ mi@@ lar@@ it@@ ies between music and A@@ S@@ L .
"For example , a musi@@ cal not@@ e cannot be fully cap@@ tu@@ red and ex@@ pres@@ sed on pa@@ per ."
And the same hol@@ ds true for a con@@ cept in A@@ S@@ L .
"I &apos;d like to share with you a pi@@ ano me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or , to have you have a better under@@ standing of how A@@ S@@ L works ."
"So , en@@ vision a pi@@ ano ."
A@@ S@@ L is bro@@ k@@ en down into many different gra@@ m@@ m@@ ati@@ cal par@@ am@@ e@@ ters .
"If you as@@ sig@@ n a different par@@ am@@ e@@ ter to each fin@@ ger as you play the pi@@ ano — such as fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sion , body movement , speed , hand sha@@ pe and so on , as you play the pi@@ ano — En@@ g@@ li@@ sh is a lin@@ e@@ ar language , as if one key is being pres@@ sed at a time ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , A@@ S@@ L is more like a ch@@ or@@ d — all 10 fin@@ g@@ ers need to come down si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously to ex@@ pre@@ ss a clear con@@ cept or idea in A@@ S@@ L ."
"If just one of those ke@@ ys were to change the ch@@ or@@ d , it would create a completely different me@@ an@@ ing ."
"The same ap@@ pl@@ ies to music in re@@ gar@@ ds to pit@@ ch , t@@ one and v@@ olu@@ me ."
"In A@@ S@@ L , by playing around with these different gra@@ m@@ m@@ ati@@ cal par@@ am@@ e@@ ters , you can ex@@ pre@@ ss different ideas ."
"For example , take the sig@@ n T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T ."
This is the sig@@ n T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T .
I &apos;m looking at you .
St@@ aring at you .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Oh — bu@@ st@@ ed . ( Laughter )
U@@ h@@ -@@ oh .
What are you looking at ?
"A@@ w , stop ."
"( Laughter ) I then started thinking , &quot; What if I was to look at A@@ S@@ L through a musi@@ cal len@@ s ? &quot;"
"If I was to create a sig@@ n and re@@ pe@@ at it over and over , it could become like a piece of vi@@ su@@ al music ."
"For example , this is the sig@@ n for &quot; &quot; day , &quot; &quot; as the su@@ n ri@@ ses and se@@ ts ."
"This is &quot; &quot; all day . &quot; &quot; If I was to re@@ pe@@ at it and s@@ low it down , vi@@ su@@ ally it looks like a piece of music ."
All ... day .
I feel the same hol@@ ds true for &quot; &quot; all night . &quot; &quot; &quot; All night . &quot;
"This is A@@ L@@ L@@ -@@ N@@ I@@ G@@ H@@ T , re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted in this d@@ raw@@ ing ."
"And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of ni@@ ghts : &quot; last night , &quot; &quot; over@@ night , &quot; ( S@@ ings ) &quot; &quot; all night long . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I feel like the third one has a lot more musi@@ c@@ ality than the other two . ( Laughter )"
This re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts how time is ex@@ pres@@ sed in A@@ S@@ L and how the di@@ stance from your body can ex@@ pre@@ ss the chang@@ es in time .
"For example , 1@@ H is one hand , 2@@ H is two hand , present ten@@ se happens clo@@ s@@ est and in front of the body , future is in front of the body and the past is to your back ."
"So , the first example is &quot; &quot; a long time ago . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en &quot; &quot; past , &quot; &quot; &quot; used to &quot; and the last one , which is my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te , with the very ro@@ man@@ tic and dra@@ m@@ atic noti@@ on to it , &quot; once upo@@ n a time . &quot;"
"@@ Y@@ et when I see the word &quot; &quot; common time , &quot; &quot; what au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally comes to mind for me is &quot; &quot; at the same time . &quot; &quot; So noti@@ ce R@@ H : right hand , L@@ H : left hand ."
We have the st@@ af@@ f across the head and the ch@@ est .
"@@ &#91; H@@ e@@ ad : R@@ H , F@@ las@@ h c@@ la@@ w &#93; &#91; C@@ om@@ m@@ on time &#93; &#91; Ch@@ est : L@@ H , F@@ las@@ h c@@ la@@ w &#93; I &apos;m now going to de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate a hand sha@@ pe called the &quot; &quot; f@@ las@@ h c@@ la@@ w . &quot; &quot; C@@ an you ple@@ ase fol@@ low along with me ?"
"E@@ very@@ body , h@@ ands up ."
"Now we &apos;re going to do it in both the head and the ch@@ est , kind of like &quot; &quot; common time &quot; &quot; or at the same time ."
"@@ Yes , got it ."
That means &quot; &quot; to f@@ all in love &quot; &quot; in Inter@@ national &#91; S@@ ig@@ n &#93; .
"( Laughter ) Inter@@ national &#91; S@@ ig@@ n &#93; , as a not@@ e , is a vi@@ su@@ al to@@ ol to help communi@@ cate across cul@@ tu@@ res and sig@@ n langu@@ ages around the world ."
The second one I &apos;d like to de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate is this — ple@@ ase fol@@ low along with me again .
And now this .
This is &quot; &quot; col@@ oni@@ z@@ ation &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
( Laughter ) Now the third — ple@@ ase fol@@ low along again .
And again .
This is &quot; &quot; en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
So let &apos;s do all three together .
"&quot; F@@ all in love , &quot; &quot; col@@ oni@@ z@@ ation &quot; and &quot; &quot; en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot; &quot; Go@@ od job , everyone ."
"( Laughter ) N@@ oti@@ ce how all three sig@@ ns are very si@@ mi@@ lar , they all happen at the head and the ch@@ est , but they con@@ v@@ ey quite different me@@ an@@ ings ."
"So it &apos;s amazing to see how A@@ S@@ L is ali@@ ve and th@@ ri@@ ving , just like music is ."
"And just because A@@ S@@ L has no sound to it , it au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally hol@@ ds no social cur@@ ren@@ cy ."
We need to start thinking har@@ der about what de@@ fin@@ es social cur@@ ren@@ cy and al@@ low A@@ S@@ L to develo@@ p its own form of cur@@ ren@@ cy — without sound .
And this could possi@@ bly be a ste@@ p to le@@ ad to a more inclu@@ sive society .
"And maybe people will understand that you don &apos;t need to be de@@ a@@ f to learn A@@ S@@ L , no@@ r do you have to be hear@@ ing to learn music ."
A@@ S@@ L is such a ri@@ ch tre@@ as@@ ure that I &apos;d like you to have the same experience .
"And I &apos;d like to in@@ vi@@ te you to open your ear@@ s , to open your eyes , take part in our culture and experience our vi@@ su@@ al language ."
"And you never know , you might just f@@ all in love with us ."
( Applause ) Thank you .
"D@@ eni@@ se K@@ a@@ h@@ l@@ er@@ -@@ Bra@@ at@@ en : H@@ ey , that &apos;s me ."
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produ@@ ced by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ r@@ o C@@ or@@ por@@ ation of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of pla@@ stic with a R@@ ad@@ i@@ o S@@ h@@ ack an@@ ten@@ na att@@ ach@@ ed to it .
So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ or@@ t of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and p@@ lu@@ m@@ b@@ ing comp@@ ati@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a Bu@@ i@@ ck hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ ali@@ le@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e to S@@ atur@@ n ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the side of a gl@@ as@@ s win@@ do@@ w in S@@ a@@ o P@@ au@@ l@@ o .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
"H@@ ere &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the back@@ side , which they started to wi@@ pe off ."
How many of you had to fi@@ ll out some sort of we@@ b form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a di@@ stor@@ ted sequ@@ ence of char@@ ac@@ ters like this ?
"H@@ ow many of you found it really , really an@@ no@@ ying ?"
"O@@ kay , out@@ standing . So I inv@@ en@@ ted that ."
( Laughter ) O@@ r I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
"And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the enti@@ ty fil@@ ling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was wri@@ t@@ ten to sub@@ m@@ it the form mi@@ llions and mi@@ llions of times ."
"The reason it works is because hum@@ ans , at least n@@ on-@@ vi@@ su@@ al@@ ly@@ -@@ im@@ pa@@ i@@ red hum@@ ans , have no t@@ rou@@ ble re@@ ading these di@@ stor@@ ted s@@ qui@@ gg@@ ly char@@ ac@@ ters , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as computer progra@@ ms simply can &apos;t do it as well yet ."
"So for example , in the case of Ti@@ c@@ ke@@ t@@ ma@@ ster , the reason you have to ty@@ pe these di@@ stor@@ ted char@@ ac@@ ters is to pre@@ v@@ ent sc@@ al@@ per@@ s from writing a program that can bu@@ y mi@@ llions of ti@@ c@@ ke@@ ts , two at a time ."
C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are used all over the Inter@@ net .
"And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the pre@@ ci@@ se sequ@@ ence of ran@@ dom char@@ ac@@ ters that is sh@@ own to the us@@ er is not so for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate ."
So this is an example from the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o regi@@ str@@ ation p@@ age .
"The ran@@ dom char@@ ac@@ ters that happened to be sh@@ own to the us@@ er were W , A , I , T , which , of course , spe@@ ll a word ."
But the best part is the mess@@ age that the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o help des@@ k got about 20 minutes later .
"T@@ ex@@ t : &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ p ! I &apos;ve been wai@@ ting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wa@@ it ."
"This of course , is not as bad as this po@@ or person ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A Pro@@ je@@ ct is something that we did here at C@@ ar@@ neg@@ ie M@@ el@@ ll@@ on over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used every@@ where ."
"L@@ et me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next ev@@ olution of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"This is a project that we call re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , which is something that we started here at C@@ ar@@ neg@@ ie M@@ el@@ l@@ on , then we turned it into a star@@ tu@@ p company ."
"And then about a year and a half ago , Go@@ og@@ le actually ac@@ qui@@ red this company ."
So let me tell you what this project started .
So this project started from the fol@@ low@@ ing realiz@@ ation : It turns out that appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately 2@@ 00 million C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are ty@@ ped every@@ day by people around the world .
"When I first heard this , I was quite pro@@ u@@ d of myself ."
"I thought , look at the impac@@ t that my research has had ."
But then I started feeling bad .
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , each time you ty@@ pe a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , essen@@ ti@@ ally you wa@@ ste 10 secon@@ ds of your time ."
"And if you mul@@ ti@@ ply that by 2@@ 00 million , you get that hum@@ ani@@ ty as a whole is wa@@ st@@ ing about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 hours every day ty@@ ping these an@@ no@@ ying C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s ."
So then I started feeling bad .
"( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get ri@@ d of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s , because the secu@@ ri@@ ty of the W@@ e@@ b sort of depen@@ ds on them ."
"But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this ef@@ for@@ t for something that is good for hum@@ ani@@ ty ?"
"So see , here &apos;s the thing ."
"W@@ hi@@ le you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , during those 10 secon@@ ds , your brain is doing something amazing ."
Y@@ our brain is doing something that compu@@ ters cannot yet do .
So can we get you to do us@@ e@@ ful work for those 10 secon@@ ds ?
"A@@ no@@ ther way of pu@@ tting it is , is there some hum@@ on@@ g@@ ous problem that we cannot yet get compu@@ ters to sol@@ ve , yet we can sp@@ li@@ t into t@@ iny 1@@ 0-@@ second ch@@ un@@ ks such that each time somebody sol@@ ves a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A they sol@@ ve a little bit of this problem ?"
"And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; y@@ es , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now ."
"So what you may not know is that now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys while you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , not only are you au@@ th@@ enti@@ c@@ ating yourself as a human , but in ad@@ di@@ tion you &apos;re actually hel@@ ping us to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze boo@@ ks ."
So let me expla@@ in how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of proje@@ cts out there trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze boo@@ ks .
Go@@ og@@ le has one . The Inter@@ net Ar@@ chi@@ ve has one .
"A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , now with the K@@ in@@ d@@ le , is trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze boo@@ ks ."
B@@ a@@ si@@ cally the way this works is you start with an old book .
"You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Li@@ ke a book ?"
"( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you s@@ can it ."
Now sc@@ an@@ ning a book is like taking a di@@ gi@@ tal photogra@@ ph of every p@@ age of the book .
It gi@@ ves you an image for every p@@ age of the book .
This is an image with te@@ xt for every p@@ age of the book .
The next ste@@ p in the process is that the computer needs to be able to deci@@ ph@@ er all of the words in this image .
"That &apos;s using a technology called O@@ C@@ R , for op@@ tical char@@ ac@@ ter re@@ cogni@@ tion , which takes a picture of te@@ xt and tries to figure out what te@@ xt is in there ."
Now the problem is that O@@ C@@ R is not perfe@@ ct .
"E@@ speci@@ ally for ol@@ der boo@@ ks where the in@@ k has f@@ ad@@ ed and the p@@ ages have turned y@@ el@@ low , O@@ C@@ R cannot re@@ cogni@@ ze a lot of the words ."
"For example , for things that were wri@@ t@@ ten more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot re@@ cogni@@ ze about 30 percent of the words ."
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot re@@ cogni@@ ze and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A on the Inter@@ net .
"So the next time you ty@@ pe a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , these words that you &apos;re ty@@ ping are actually words that are coming from boo@@ ks that are being di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed that the computer could not re@@ cogni@@ ze ."
"And now the reason we have two words now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you ."
"But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot gra@@ de it for you ."
"So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer ."
"We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , ple@@ ase ty@@ pe both ."
"And if you ty@@ pe the cor@@ re@@ ct word for the one for which the system already know@@ s the answer , it as@@ su@@ mes you are human , and it also gets some con@@ fi@@ dence that you ty@@ ped the other word cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ly ."
"And if we re@@ pe@@ at this process to like 10 different people and all of them ag@@ ree on what the new word is , then we get one more word di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed ac@@ cur@@ ately ."
So this is how the system works .
"And basically , since we rele@@ as@@ ed it about three or four years ago , a lot of we@@ b@@ si@@ tes have started s@@ wit@@ ching from the old C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people wa@@ st@@ ed their time to the new C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people are hel@@ ping to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze boo@@ ks ."
"So for example , Ti@@ c@@ ke@@ t@@ ma@@ ster ."
"So every time you bu@@ y ti@@ c@@ ke@@ ts on Ti@@ c@@ ke@@ t@@ ma@@ ster , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"F@@ ace@@ book : E@@ very time you ad@@ d a friend or po@@ ke somebody , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"T@@ wit@@ ter and about 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 other si@@ tes are all using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"And in fact , the number of si@@ tes that are using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re di@@ gi@@ ti@@ z@@ ing per day is really , really large ."
"It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of about two and a half million boo@@ ks a year ."
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people ty@@ ping C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s on the Inter@@ net .
"( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , fun@@ ny things can happen ."
And this is es@@ pe@@ cially true because now we &apos;re gi@@ ving people two ran@@ dom@@ ly cho@@ s@@ en En@@ g@@ li@@ sh words next to each other .
So fun@@ ny things can happen .
"For example , we pre@@ sen@@ ted this word ."
It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
"But if you present it along with another ran@@ dom@@ ly cho@@ s@@ en word , bad things can happen ."
"So we get this . ( T@@ ex@@ t : bad ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans ) But it &apos;s even wor@@ se , because the particular we@@ b@@ site where we show@@ ed this actually happened to be called The E@@ m@@ bas@@ sy of the K@@ ing@@ dom of God ."
( Laughter ) O@@ op@@ s . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
Joh@@ n@@ E@@ d@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m ( T@@ ex@@ t : D@@ am@@ n li@@ ber@@ al ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on in@@ sul@@ ting people left and right every@@ day .
"Now , of course , we &apos;re not just in@@ sul@@ ting people ."
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re pres@@ ent@@ ing two ran@@ dom@@ ly cho@@ s@@ en words , interesting things can happen ."
"So this actually has given ri@@ se to a really big Inter@@ net me@@ me that ten@@ s of thousands of people have parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed in , which is called C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A art ."
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
"I@@ mag@@ ine you &apos;re using the Inter@@ net and you see a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A that you think is some@@ what pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , like this C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A . ( T@@ ex@@ t : in@@ visi@@ ble to@@ ast@@ er ) Th@@ en what you &apos;re sup@@ posed to do is you take a scre@@ en sh@@ ot of it ."
"Th@@ en of course , you fi@@ ll out the C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A because you help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"But then , first you take a scre@@ en sh@@ ot , and then you dra@@ w something that is re@@ lated to it ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
There are ten@@ s of thousands of these .
S@@ ome of them are very cu@@ te . ( T@@ ex@@ t : c@@ len@@ ched it ) ( Laughter ) S@@ ome of them are fun@@ nie@@ r .
"( T@@ ex@@ t : st@@ on@@ ed f@@ oun@@ ders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like p@@ ale@@ on@@ to@@ logi@@ cal sh@@ vi@@ s@@ le , they con@@ tain S@@ no@@ o@@ p D@@ og@@ g . ( Laughter )"
"O@@ kay , so this is my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te number of re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
So this is the fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te thing that I like about this whole project .
"This is the number of di@@ st@@ in@@ ct people that have hel@@ ped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze at least one word out of a book through re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A : 7@@ 50 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s popul@@ ation , has hel@@ ped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human know@@ le@@ dge ."
And it is num@@ bers like these that moti@@ v@@ ate my research ag@@ en@@ da .
"So the question that moti@@ v@@ ates my research is the fol@@ low@@ ing : If you look at hum@@ ani@@ ty &apos;s lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale ach@@ ie@@ v@@ em@@ ents , these really big things that hum@@ ani@@ ty has got@@ ten together and done histori@@ cally — like for example , building the py@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds of E@@ g@@ y@@ pt or the P@@ an@@ ama C@@ an@@ al or pu@@ tting a man on the Mo@@ on — there is a cu@@ ri@@ ous fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people ."
"It &apos;s we@@ ird ; they were all done with about 10@@ 0,000 people ."
"And the reason for that is because , before the Inter@@ net , co@@ ordin@@ ating more than 10@@ 0,000 people , let alone pa@@ ying them , was essen@@ ti@@ ally im@@ possible ."
"But now with the Inter@@ net , I &apos;ve just sh@@ own you a project where we &apos;ve got@@ ten 7@@ 50 million people to help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human know@@ le@@ dge ."
"So the question that moti@@ v@@ ates my research is , if we can put a man on the Mo@@ on with 10@@ 0,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?"
"So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different proje@@ cts that we &apos;ve been working on ."
Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most exci@@ ted about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been se@@ mi@@ -@@ qu@@ ie@@ tly working on for the last year and a half or so .
It ha@@ sn &apos;t yet been la@@ un@@ ched . It &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"S@@ in@@ ce it ha@@ sn &apos;t been la@@ un@@ ched , sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h !"
"( Laughter ) Yeah , I can tr@@ ust you &apos;ll do that ."
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
"It started with me pos@@ ing a question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent , Se@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s Se@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
So I posed the question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent .
"B@@ y the way , you did hear me cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ly ; his last name is H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people trans@@ lat@@ ing the W@@ e@@ b into every major language for f@@ ree ?
"O@@ kay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , trans@@ lat@@ ing the W@@ e@@ b ."
So right now the W@@ e@@ b is parti@@ tion@@ ed into mul@@ ti@@ ple langu@@ ages .
A large f@@ rac@@ tion of it is in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh .
"If you don &apos;t know any En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , you can &apos;t ac@@ cess it ."
"But there &apos;s large f@@ rac@@ tions in other different langu@@ ages , and if you don &apos;t know those langu@@ ages , you can &apos;t ac@@ cess it ."
"So I would like to trans@@ l@@ ate all of the W@@ e@@ b , or at least most of the W@@ e@@ b , into every major language ."
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
"Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use compu@@ ters to trans@@ l@@ ate ?"
Why can &apos;t we use mach@@ ine trans@@ l@@ ation ?
M@@ ach@@ ine trans@@ l@@ ation now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys is star@@ ting to trans@@ l@@ ate some s@@ ent@@ ences here and there .
Why can &apos;t we use it to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b ?
Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
It makes a lot of mist@@ ak@@ es .
"E@@ ven when it doesn &apos;t make a mist@@ ake , since it makes so many mist@@ ak@@ es , you don &apos;t know whether to tr@@ ust it or not ."
So let me show you an example of something that was trans@@ lated with a mach@@ ine .
A@@ c@@ tually it was a for@@ um pos@@ t .
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt .
It was trans@@ lated from J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese into En@@ g@@ li@@ sh .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
This person star@@ ts apo@@ logi@@ z@@ ing for the fact that it &apos;s trans@@ lated with a computer .
So the next s@@ ent@@ ence is is going to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to the question .
So he &apos;s just expla@@ ining something .
"R@@ e@@ member , it &apos;s a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : A@@ t often , the go@@ at@@ -@@ time in@@ st@@ all a er@@ ro@@ r is v@@ om@@ it . ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes the first part of the question ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : How many times like the wind , a po@@ le , and the dra@@ g@@ on ? ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te part of the question ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : This in@@ sul@@ t to father &apos;s st@@ ones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the ending , which is my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te part of the whole thing ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : P@@ le@@ ase apo@@ logi@@ ze for your stu@@ pi@@ di@@ ty . There are a many th@@ ank you . ) ( Laughter ) O@@ kay , so computer trans@@ l@@ ation , not yet good enough ."
So back to the question .
So we need people to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b .
"So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?"
We could pay prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal language trans@@ lat@@ ors to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b .
We could do that .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , it would be extre@@ me@@ ly ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
"For example , trans@@ lat@@ ing a t@@ iny , t@@ iny f@@ rac@@ tion of the whole W@@ e@@ b , Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a , into one other language , S@@ p@@ ani@@ sh ."
"Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a ex@@ ist@@ s in S@@ p@@ ani@@ sh , but it &apos;s very small com@@ par@@ ed to the size of En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ."
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of En@@ g@@ li@@ sh .
"If we wanted to trans@@ l@@ ate the other 80 percent into S@@ p@@ ani@@ sh , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most ex@@ plo@@ i@@ ted , out@@ sour@@ cing country out there ."
So it would be very ex@@ pen@@ sive .
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people trans@@ lat@@ ing the W@@ e@@ b into every major language for f@@ ree .
"Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big h@@ ur@@ d@@ les , two big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les ."
The first one is a l@@ ack of bi@@ lin@@ gu@@ als .
So I don &apos;t even know if there ex@@ ist@@ s 100 million people out there using the W@@ e@@ b who are bi@@ lin@@ gu@@ al enough to help us trans@@ l@@ ate .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a l@@ ack of moti@@ vation .
How are we going to moti@@ v@@ ate people to actually trans@@ l@@ ate the W@@ e@@ b for f@@ ree ?
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , you have to pay people to do this ."
So how are we going to moti@@ v@@ ate them to do it for f@@ ree ?
"Now when we were star@@ ting to think about this , we were blo@@ cked by these two things ."
"But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to sol@@ ve both these problems with the same solution ."
There &apos;s a way to ki@@ ll two bir@@ ds with one st@@ one .
"And that is to trans@@ form language trans@@ l@@ ation into something that mi@@ llions of people want to do , and that also hel@@ ps with the problem of l@@ ack of bi@@ lin@@ gu@@ als , and that is language education ."
"So it turns out that today , there are over 1@@ .@@ 2 billion people lear@@ ning a fore@@ ig@@ n language ."
"P@@ e@@ ople really , really want to learn a fore@@ ig@@ n language ."
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being for@@ ced to do so in school .
"For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have pa@@ id over $ 500 for so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to learn a new language ."
"So people really , really want to learn a new language ."
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new we@@ b@@ site — it &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go — where the basi@@ c idea is people learn a new language for f@@ ree while si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously trans@@ lat@@ ing the W@@ e@@ b .
And so basically they &apos;re lear@@ ning by doing .
"So the way this works is wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re a just a begin@@ ner , we give you very , very simple s@@ ent@@ ences ."
"There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple s@@ ent@@ ences on the W@@ e@@ b ."
"We give you very , very simple s@@ ent@@ ences along with what each word means ."
"And as you trans@@ l@@ ate them , and as you see how other people trans@@ l@@ ate them , you start lear@@ ning the language ."
"And as you get more and more adv@@ an@@ ced , we give you more and more comple@@ x s@@ ent@@ ences to trans@@ l@@ ate ."
"But at all times , you &apos;re lear@@ ning by doing ."
Now the c@@ razy thing about this meth@@ od is that it actually really works .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , people are really , really lear@@ ning a language ."
"We &apos;re mo@@ st@@ ly done building it , and now we &apos;re test@@ ing it ."
Pe@@ ople really can learn a language with it .
And they learn it about as well as the le@@ ading language lear@@ ning so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
So people really do learn a language .
"And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting ."
"Because you see with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , people are actually lear@@ ning with real cont@@ ent ."
"As op@@ posed to lear@@ ning with ma@@ de@@ -@@ up s@@ ent@@ ences , people are lear@@ ning with real cont@@ ent , which is in@@ her@@ ently interesting ."
So people really do learn a language .
"But per@@ haps more sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly , the trans@@ l@@ ations that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just begin@@ n@@ ers , the trans@@ l@@ ations that we get are as ac@@ cur@@ ate as those of prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal language trans@@ lat@@ ors , which is very sur@@ pri@@ sing ."
So let me show you one example .
This is a s@@ ent@@ ence that was trans@@ lated from G@@ er@@ man into En@@ g@@ li@@ sh .
The top is the G@@ er@@ man .
The mi@@ ddle is an En@@ g@@ li@@ sh trans@@ l@@ ation that was done by somebody who was a prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal En@@ g@@ li@@ sh trans@@ lat@@ or who we pa@@ id 20 c@@ ents a word for this trans@@ l@@ ation .
"And the bot@@ tom is a trans@@ l@@ ation by us@@ ers of D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , n@@ one of wh@@ om knew any G@@ er@@ man before they started using the site ."
"You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfe@@ ct ."
"Now of course , we play a tri@@ ck here to make the trans@@ l@@ ations as good as prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal language trans@@ lat@@ ors ."
We com@@ b@@ ine the trans@@ l@@ ations of mul@@ ti@@ ple begin@@ n@@ ers to get the qu@@ ality of a single prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal trans@@ lat@@ or .
"Now even though we &apos;re com@@ b@@ ining the trans@@ l@@ ations , the site actually can trans@@ l@@ ate pretty f@@ ast ."
"So let me show you , this is our est@@ im@@ ates of how f@@ ast we could trans@@ l@@ ate Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a from En@@ g@@ li@@ sh into S@@ p@@ ani@@ sh ."
"R@@ e@@ member , this is 50 million dol@@ lar@@ s@@ -@@ wor@@ th of val@@ ue ."
"So if we wanted to trans@@ l@@ ate Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a into S@@ p@@ ani@@ sh , we could do it in five weeks with 10@@ 0,000 ac@@ tive us@@ ers ."
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million ac@@ tive us@@ ers .
"S@@ in@@ ce all the proje@@ cts that my group has worked on so far have got@@ ten mi@@ llions of us@@ ers , we &apos;re hop@@ e@@ ful that we &apos;ll be able to trans@@ l@@ ate extre@@ me@@ ly f@@ ast with this project ."
Now the thing that I &apos;m most exci@@ ted about with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think this provi@@ des a fa@@ ir business model for language education .
"So here &apos;s the thing : The cur@@ r@@ ent business model for language education is the stud@@ ent pa@@ ys , and in particular , the stud@@ ent pa@@ ys Ro@@ se@@ t@@ ta St@@ one 500 dollars ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the cur@@ r@@ ent business model .
The problem with this business model is that 9@@ 5 percent of the world &apos;s popul@@ ation doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
So it &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly un@@ fa@@ ir towar@@ ds the po@@ or .
This is tot@@ ally bi@@ as@@ ed towar@@ ds the ri@@ ch .
"Now see , in D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , because while you learn you &apos;re actually cre@@ ating val@@ ue , you &apos;re trans@@ lat@@ ing stuff — which for example , we could char@@ ge somebody for trans@@ l@@ ations ."
So this is how we could mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze this .
"S@@ in@@ ce people are cre@@ ating val@@ ue while they &apos;re lear@@ ning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time ."
"But the mag@@ i@@ cal thing here is that they &apos;re pa@@ ying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent any@@ ways lear@@ ning the language ."
So the nice thing about D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think it provi@@ des a fa@@ ir business model — one that doesn &apos;t di@@ sc@@ ri@@ min@@ ate against po@@ or people .
So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
( Applause ) So here &apos;s the site .
"We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet la@@ un@@ ched , but if you go there , you can sig@@ n up to be part of our pri@@ v@@ ate be@@ ta , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet la@@ un@@ ched this D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"B@@ y the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is the work of a really aw@@ es@@ ome team , some of wh@@ om are here ."
So th@@ ank you .
( Applause )
Thank you .
"T@@ wo years ago , I sto@@ od on the TED st@@ age in Ar@@ us@@ h@@ a , T@@ an@@ z@@ ania ."
I spo@@ ke very br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly about one of my pro@@ ud@@ est cre@@ ations .
It was a simple mach@@ ine that changed my life .
"Be@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in M@@ al@@ aw@@ i ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Inter@@ net .
"O@@ n the st@@ age that day , I was so ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"My En@@ g@@ li@@ sh lost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by so many az@@ un@@ g@@ u , white people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"A@@ ll si@@ st@@ ers , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my d@@ ad when I was a little bo@@ y .
"Be@@ fore I disco@@ vered the won@@ ders of science , I was just a simple farm@@ er in a country of po@@ or farm@@ ers ."
"L@@ i@@ ke everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ i@@ ze ."
One year our for@@ tu@@ ne turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we exper@@ ien@@ ced an aw@@ ful fam@@ ine .
Wi@@ th@@ in five months all M@@ al@@ a@@ wi@@ ans began to star@@ ve to death .
"My family ate one me@@ al per day , at night ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ low@@ s of n@@ si@@ ma for each one of us .
The food pas@@ ses through our bod@@ ies .
We dro@@ p down to nothing .
"In M@@ al@@ aw@@ i , the secon@@ d@@ ary school , you have to pay school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the hun@@ ger , I was for@@ ced to dro@@ p out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fie@@ l@@ ds .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I felt very happy to be at the secon@@ d@@ ary school , so I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to re@@ cei@@ ve education ."
So I went to a li@@ br@@ ary .
"I read boo@@ ks , science boo@@ ks , es@@ pe@@ cially physi@@ cs ."
I couldn &apos;t read En@@ g@@ li@@ sh that well .
I used di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms and pi@@ ctures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that know@@ le@@ dge in my h@@ ands .
It said a win@@ d@@ mi@@ ll could pu@@ m@@ p water and gener@@ ate electri@@ city .
"P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , a def@@ en@@ se against hun@@ ger , which we were exper@@ ien@@ cing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one win@@ d@@ mi@@ ll for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a sc@@ ra@@ p y@@ ard where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , inclu@@ ding my mother , said I was c@@ razy ."
"( Laughter ) I found a trac@@ tor f@@ an , sho@@ ck ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ p@@ es ."
"U@@ sing a bi@@ cy@@ cle fra@@ me and an old bi@@ cy@@ cle dy@@ na@@ mo , I built my mach@@ ine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four li@@ ghts , with s@@ wit@@ ch@@ es , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it bre@@ ak@@ er , mode@@ led after an electri@@ c be@@ ll ."
A@@ no@@ ther mach@@ ine pu@@ m@@ ps water for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .
Q@@ u@@ e@@ u@@ es of people start lin@@ ing up at my house ( Laughter ) to char@@ ge their mo@@ bi@@ le phone .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the re@@ por@@ ters came too , which le@@ ad to blo@@ gg@@ ers and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an air@@ pl@@ ane before .
I had never s@@ lep@@ t in a hot@@ el .
"So , on st@@ age that day in Ar@@ us@@ h@@ a , my En@@ g@@ li@@ sh lost , I said something like , &quot; I tr@@ ied . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Afri@@ cans , and the po@@ or who are stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with your dre@@ am@@ s ."
God bl@@ ess .
Ma@@ ybe one day you will wat@@ ch this on the Inter@@ net .

"In the 19@@ 8@@ 0s in the communi@@ st E@@ ast@@ er@@ n G@@ er@@ many , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pew@@ ri@@ ter , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government ."
You had to regi@@ ster a sam@@ ple sh@@ e@@ et of te@@ xt out of the ty@@ pew@@ ri@@ ter .
And this was done so the government could tr@@ ack where te@@ xt was coming from .
"If they found a pa@@ per which had the wrong kind of thought , they could tr@@ ack down who created that thought ."
"And we in the W@@ est couldn &apos;t understand how any@@ body could do this , how much this would re@@ stri@@ ct fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ e@@ ch ."
We would never do that in our own countries .
"But today in 20@@ 11 , if you go and bu@@ y a color las@@ er prin@@ ter from any major las@@ er prin@@ ter man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ re@@ r and pr@@ int a p@@ age , that p@@ age will end up having s@@ light y@@ el@@ low d@@ ots prin@@ ted on every single p@@ age in a pat@@ ter@@ n which makes the p@@ age uni@@ qu@@ e to you and to your prin@@ ter ."
This is happening to us today .
And no@@ body seem@@ s to be making a f@@ us@@ s about it .
"And this is an example of the ways that our own govern@@ ments are using technology against us , the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ."
And this is one of the ma@@ in three sources of on@@ line problems today .
"If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the on@@ line world , we can group the att@@ ac@@ ks based on the att@@ ac@@ k@@ ers ."
We have three ma@@ in grou@@ ps .
We have on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als .
"L@@ i@@ ke here , we have M@@ r. D@@ imi@@ try G@@ olu@@ bo@@ v from the city of K@@ ie@@ v in U@@ kra@@ ine ."
And the moti@@ ves of on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are very e@@ asy to understand .
These guys make money .
"They use on@@ line att@@ ac@@ ks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it ."
"We actually have se@@ ver@@ al c@@ ases of mi@@ lli@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ res on@@ line , mul@@ ti@@ mi@@ lli@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ res , who made money with their att@@ ac@@ ks ."
Here &apos;s V@@ l@@ ad@@ imi@@ r T@@ sa@@ st@@ si@@ n form T@@ ar@@ tu in E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
This is Ste@@ ph@@ en W@@ at@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ d@@ in .
"This is M@@ at@@ the@@ w An@@ der@@ son , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ D@@ a@@ our and so on and so on ."
"These guys make their for@@ tu@@ n@@ es on@@ line , but they make it through the il@@ leg@@ al means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts while we do on@@ line ban@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers to colle@@ ct our cre@@ d@@ it car@@ d information while we are doing on@@ line sh@@ op@@ ping from an in@@ fe@@ cted computer ."
"The U.@@ S. Se@@ cre@@ t S@@ er@@ vice , two months ago , f@@ roz@@ e the S@@ wi@@ ss b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t of M@@ r. S@@ am J@@ a@@ in right here , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.@@ S. dollars on it when it was f@@ roz@@ en ."
M@@ r. J@@ a@@ in hi@@ m@@ self is on the lo@@ ose ; no@@ body know@@ s where he is .
And I c@@ la@@ im it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more li@@ ke@@ ly for any of us to become the vi@@ cti@@ m of a cri@@ me on@@ line than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvi@@ ous that this is only going to get wor@@ se .
"In the future , the maj@@ ori@@ ty of cri@@ me will be happening on@@ line ."
The second major group of att@@ ac@@ k@@ ers that we are wat@@ ching today are not moti@@ v@@ ated by money .
"They &apos;re moti@@ v@@ ated by something else — moti@@ v@@ ated by prote@@ sts , moti@@ v@@ ated by an op@@ ini@@ on , moti@@ v@@ ated by the l@@ augh@@ s ."
G@@ rou@@ ps like An@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous have ri@@ s@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major pla@@ y@@ er in the fie@@ ld of on@@ line att@@ ac@@ ks .
"So those are the three ma@@ in att@@ ac@@ k@@ ers : cri@@ min@@ als who do it for the money , h@@ ac@@ k@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like An@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous doing it for the prote@@ st , but then the last group are n@@ ation st@@ ates , govern@@ ments doing the att@@ ac@@ ks ."
And then we look at c@@ ases like what happened in D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a pri@@ me example of what happens when govern@@ ments att@@ ack against their own ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens .
"D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate Au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty from The Ne@@ ther@@ l@@ ands — or actually , it was ."
It was ru@@ n@@ ning into ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ cy last f@@ all because they were h@@ ac@@ ked into .
S@@ ome@@ body bro@@ ke in and they h@@ ac@@ ked it th@@ o@@ rou@@ gh@@ ly .
"And I asked last week in a me@@ e@@ ting with D@@ ut@@ ch government re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ati@@ ves , I asked one of the le@@ ad@@ ers of the team whether he found pl@@ au@@ si@@ ble that people d@@ ied because of the D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar h@@ ack ."
And his answer was y@@ es .
So how do people die as the resul@@ t of a h@@ ack like this ?
Well D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .@@ A@@ .
They se@@ ll cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ c@@ ates .
What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ c@@ ates ?
"Well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate if you have a we@@ b@@ site that has h@@ t@@ t@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted ser@@ vi@@ ces , ser@@ vi@@ ces like G@@ ma@@ il ."
"Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ ma@@ il or one of their compe@@ ti@@ t@@ ors , but these ser@@ vi@@ ces are es@@ pe@@ cially popul@@ ar in tot@@ ali@@ t@@ ari@@ an st@@ ates like I@@ ran , where dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents use fore@@ ig@@ n ser@@ vi@@ ces like G@@ ma@@ il because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y than the local ser@@ vi@@ ces and they are en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L conne@@ ctions , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ o@@ p on their di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions ."
E@@ x@@ cept they can if they h@@ ack into a fore@@ ig@@ n C@@ .@@ A@@ .
and issue ro@@ gu@@ e cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ c@@ ates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
"What about A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt ?"
"Well in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of the E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an se@@ cre@@ t poli@@ ce in Ap@@ ri@@ l 20@@ 11 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of pa@@ per@@ s ."
"A@@ mon@@ g those pa@@ per@@ s , was this bin@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And within that bin@@ der were not@@ es from a company based in G@@ er@@ many which had s@@ old the E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an government a set of to@@ ols for inter@@ cep@@ ting — and in very large scale — all the communi@@ cation of the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens of the country ."
"They had s@@ old this to@@ ol for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 Eu@@ ro@@ s to the E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an government ."
The company he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters are right here .
So W@@ est@@ er@@ n govern@@ ments are provi@@ ding tot@@ ali@@ t@@ ari@@ an govern@@ ments with to@@ ols to do this against their own ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens .
But W@@ est@@ er@@ n govern@@ ments are doing it to themselves as well .
"For example , in G@@ er@@ many , just a couple of weeks ago the so@@ -@@ called St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by G@@ er@@ man government offi@@ ci@@ als to inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ate their own ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ."
"If you are a s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct in a cri@@ min@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous , your phone will be ta@@ pped ."
"But today , it goes be@@ y@@ ond that ."
They will ta@@ p your Inter@@ net conne@@ ction .
"They will even use to@@ ols like St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an to in@@ fe@@ ct your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ab@@ les them to wat@@ ch all your communi@@ cation , to list@@ en to your on@@ line di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions , to colle@@ ct your pas@@ s@@ words ."
"Now when we think de@@ e@@ per about things like these , the obvi@@ ous respon@@ se from people should be that , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really af@@ fe@@ ct me because I &apos;m a leg@@ al ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ."
Why should I wor@@ ry ?
"Because I have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot; &quot; And this is an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent , which doesn &apos;t make sense ."
P@@ ri@@ vac@@ y is im@@ pl@@ ied .
P@@ ri@@ vac@@ y is not up for di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion .
This is not a question between pri@@ vac@@ y against secu@@ ri@@ ty .
It &apos;s a question of fre@@ e@@ dom against control .
"And while we might tr@@ ust our govern@@ ments right now , right here in 20@@ 11 , any right we give away will be given away for good ."
"And do we tr@@ ust , do we b@@ lin@@ d@@ ly tr@@ ust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?"
And these are the questions that we have to wor@@ ry about for the next 50 years .
We re@@ tain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying mu@@ n@@ dane sounds .
"This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble d@@ ry@@ er ."
"Now sound is my pas@@ sion , it &apos;s my life ."
( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to speak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ u@@ es .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally under@@ sto@@ od that questions of mor@@ ality — questions of good and evi@@ l and right and wrong — are questions about which science offi@@ cially has no op@@ ini@@ on ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we val@@ ue , but it can never tell us what we ou@@ ght to val@@ ue ."
"And , con@@ sequ@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th dy@@ ing for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ stitu@@ tes a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to ar@@ gu@@ e that this is an il@@ lu@@ sion — that the se@@ par@@ ation between science and human val@@ u@@ es is an il@@ lu@@ sion — and actually quite a d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for mor@@ ality and human val@@ u@@ es , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ u@@ es se@@ em to be@@ long to different sp@@ her@@ es ."
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ ption of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ou@@ ght to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ u@@ es are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the wel@@ l-@@ being of con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous cre@@ at@@ ures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ thi@@ cal ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations tow@@ ard ro@@ cks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel comp@@ as@@ sion for ro@@ cks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ cks can su@@ f@@ f@@ er . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our fel@@ low pri@@ mat@@ es than we are about in@@ se@@ cts , as in@@ de@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ posed to a gre@@ ater r@@ ange of poten@@ tial happ@@ iness and su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing ."
"Now , the c@@ ru@@ cial thing to noti@@ ce here is that this is a fac@@ tu@@ al c@@ la@@ im : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ stru@@ ed the relation@@ ship between biologi@@ cal comple@@ x@@ ity and the possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ se@@ cts ."
"And there &apos;s no noti@@ on , no ver@@ sion of human mor@@ ality and human val@@ u@@ es that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point redu@@ ci@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous experience and its possible chang@@ es ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ u@@ es from religi@@ on , even if you think that good and evi@@ l ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely rel@@ ate to con@@ di@@ tions after death — either to an e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty of happ@@ iness with God or an e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty of su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing in he@@ ll — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness and its chang@@ es ."
"And to say that such chang@@ es can per@@ si@@ st after death is itself a fac@@ tu@@ al c@@ la@@ im , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to speak about the con@@ di@@ tions of wel@@ l-@@ being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a contin@@ u@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fai@@ led state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mo@@ thers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where str@@ ang@@ ers cannot find the basi@@ s for pe@@ ace@@ ful col@@ labor@@ ation , where people are mu@@ r@@ der@@ ed indi@@ sc@@ ri@@ min@@ ately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this contin@@ u@@ um towar@@ ds something quite a bit more i@@ dy@@ lli@@ c , to a place where a con@@ fer@@ ence like this is even con@@ cei@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ era to the water be a good idea ?
P@@ rob@@ ably not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evi@@ l ey@@ e , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ ately bl@@ ame their neigh@@ b@@ ors ? P@@ rob@@ ably not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human communi@@ ties fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And mor@@ ality re@@ lat@@ es to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ u@@ es we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our situ@@ ation in the world can be under@@ sto@@ od at many le@@ v@@ els — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic systems and poli@@ tical ar@@ r@@ ang@@ em@@ ents ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human wel@@ l-@@ being we are , of ne@@ ces@@ sity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ i@@ ci@@ de b@@ om@@ ber does get 7@@ 2 vi@@ r@@ gin@@ s in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his per@@ son@@ ality — his rather un@@ for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate per@@ son@@ ality — is the produ@@ ct of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions of culture — if culture chang@@ es us , as in@@ de@@ ed it does , it chang@@ es us by chang@@ ing our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ e@@ fore whatever cul@@ tu@@ ral v@@ ari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh can , at least in prin@@ ci@@ ple , be under@@ sto@@ od in the con@@ te@@ xt of a mat@@ ur@@ ing science of the mind — neuro@@ science , psycho@@ logy , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m ar@@ gu@@ ing is that val@@ ue &apos;s redu@@ ced to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous experience of con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can ther@@ e@@ fore vi@@ su@@ ali@@ ze a space of possible chang@@ es in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a mor@@ al land@@ s@@ cape , with pe@@ ak@@ s and val@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ re@@ spo@@ nd to differ@@ ences in the wel@@ l-@@ being of con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous cre@@ at@@ ures , both per@@ s@@ onal and colle@@ ctive ."
"And one thing to noti@@ ce is that per@@ haps there are st@@ ates of human wel@@ l-@@ being that we r@@ are@@ ly ac@@ cess , that few people ac@@ cess ."
And these a@@ wa@@ it our disco@@ very .
P@@ er@@ haps some of these st@@ ates can be appro@@ pri@@ ately called m@@ yst@@ i@@ cal or spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al .
P@@ er@@ haps there are other st@@ ates that we can &apos;t ac@@ cess because of how our min@@ ds are stru@@ ctu@@ red but other min@@ ds possi@@ bly could ac@@ cess them .
"Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to ma@@ p this space , or that we will have scienti@@ fic ans@@ w@@ ers to every con@@ cei@@ v@@ able mor@@ al question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for in@@ stance , that you will one day con@@ sul@@ t a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should b@@ om@@ b I@@ ran &apos;s nuclear fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ies , or whether you can de@@ du@@ ct the full cost of TED as a business ex@@ pen@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions af@@ fe@@ ct human wel@@ l-@@ being then they do have ans@@ w@@ ers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ mi@@ tting this — just ad@@ mi@@ tting that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to the question of how hum@@ ans fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh — will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our expe@@ ct@@ ations of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For in@@ stance , there are 2@@ 1 st@@ ates in our country where cor@@ po@@ ral pu@@ ni@@ sh@@ ment in the clas@@ s@@ room is leg@@ al , where it is leg@@ al for a teach@@ er to be@@ at a child with a wo@@ o@@ den bo@@ ard , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing large bru@@ is@@ es and bli@@ st@@ ers and even bre@@ aking the sk@@ in ."
"And hundre@@ ds of thousands of children , in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , are sub@@ je@@ cted to this every year ."
"The lo@@ c@@ ations of these en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed di@@ stri@@ cts , I think , will fa@@ il to sur@@ pri@@ se you ."
We &apos;re not talking about Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ cut .
And the r@@ ati@@ on@@ ale for this behavi@@ or is ex@@ pli@@ ci@@ tly religi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ ator of the universe hi@@ m@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , l@@ est we spo@@ il the child — this is in Pro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the obvi@@ ous question : Is it a good idea , gener@@ ally spe@@ aking , to sub@@ je@@ ct children to pa@@ in and violence and public hu@@ mili@@ ation as a way of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing health@@ y emoti@@ onal develo@@ pment and good behavi@@ or ?"
"( Laughter ) Is there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the noti@@ on of wel@@ l-@@ being is tru@@ ly un@@ de@@ fin@@ ed , and seem@@ ing@@ ly per@@ pe@@ tually open to be re@@ -@@ con@@ stru@@ ed ."
"And so , how ther@@ e@@ fore can there be an obje@@ ctive noti@@ on of wel@@ l-@@ being ?"
"Well , consi@@ der by an@@ al@@ og@@ y , the con@@ cept of physi@@ cal health ."
The con@@ cept of physi@@ cal health is un@@ de@@ fin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from Mi@@ cha@@ el S@@ pe@@ c@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
When this stat@@ ue was car@@ ved the a@@ ver@@ age life expe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the develo@@ ped world .
There may come a time when we me@@ ddle with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to run a mar@@ a@@ th@@ on at age 2@@ 00 will be consi@@ der@@ ed a pro@@ found dis@@ ability .
Pe@@ ople will sen@@ d you d@@ on@@ ations when you &apos;re in that con@@ di@@ tion .
"( Laughter ) N@@ oti@@ ce that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is open , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely open for re@@ vision , does not make it vac@@ u@@ ous ."
The di@@ st@@ in@@ ction between a health@@ y person and a de@@ ad one is about as clear and con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to noti@@ ce is there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the mor@@ al land@@ s@@ cape : There may be e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent ways to organi@@ ze a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ imi@@ ze human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ m@@ ine an obje@@ ctive mor@@ ality ?"
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tem@@ p@@ ted to ar@@ gu@@ e to you that there must be one right food to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a r@@ ange of materi@@ als that con@@ stitu@@ te health@@ y food .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less a clear di@@ st@@ in@@ ction between food and po@@ is@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ w@@ ers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tem@@ pt us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a uni@@ vers@@ al mor@@ ality would requi@@ re mor@@ al pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ m@@ it of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for in@@ stance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as mor@@ al tru@@ th ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , by an@@ al@@ og@@ y , the g@@ ame of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to play good ch@@ ess , a prin@@ ci@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t lo@@ se your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ mi@@ ts some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mom@@ ents when lo@@ sing your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en is a bri@@ lli@@ ant thing to do .
There are mom@@ ents when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a dom@@ a@@ in of perfe@@ ct obje@@ cti@@ vity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this br@@ ings us to the sor@@ ts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the mor@@ al sp@@ here ."
Con@@ si@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bod@@ ies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can co@@ ver them up .
"Now , it is the posi@@ tion , gener@@ ally spe@@ aking , of our in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ ost@@ on or P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , who are we to say that the pro@@ u@@ d d@@ eni@@ z@@ ens of an an@@ cient culture are wrong to force their wi@@ ves and d@@ augh@@ ters to live in c@@ lot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with len@@ g@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or th@@ row bat@@ tery ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they dec@@ line the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of being smo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pre@@ ten@@ d that we know so little about human wel@@ l-@@ being that we have to be n@@ on-@@ ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment@@ al about a prac@@ ti@@ ce like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary we@@ aring of a ve@@ il — women should be able to we@@ ar whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary mean in a community where , when a girl gets ra@@ ped , her father &apos;s first im@@ pul@@ se , rather often , is to mu@@ r@@ der her out of sha@@ me ?"
"J@@ ust let that fact de@@ ton@@ ate in your brain for a minu@@ te : Y@@ our d@@ aughter gets ra@@ ped , and what you want to do is ki@@ ll her ."
What are the ch@@ an@@ ces that re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts a pe@@ ak of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfe@@ ct solution in our own society ."
"For in@@ stance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ stand almost any@@ where in the ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ed world ."
"Now , gran@@ ted , for many men it may requi@@ re a de@@ gre@@ e in phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y to see something wrong with these images ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a ref@@ le@@ ctive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfe@@ ct ex@@ pres@@ sion of psycho@@ logi@@ cal bal@@ ance with re@@ spe@@ ct to v@@ ari@@ ab@@ les like y@@ outh and beau@@ ty and women &apos;s bod@@ ies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ ti@@ mal environment in which to ra@@ ise our children ?"
"P@@ rob@@ ably not . OK , so per@@ haps there &apos;s some place on the spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m between these two extre@@ mes that re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts a place of better bal@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ haps there are many such places — again , given other chang@@ es in human culture there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the mor@@ al land@@ s@@ cape ."
But the thing to noti@@ ce is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ ak .
"Now the i@@ ro@@ ny , from my perspe@@ ctive , is that the only people who se@@ em to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to mor@@ al questions are religi@@ ous de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ w@@ ers to mor@@ al questions because they got these ans@@ w@@ ers from a vo@@ ice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind , not because they made an inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s of the ca@@ uses and con@@ di@@ tion of human and ani@@ mal wel@@ l-@@ being ."
"In fact , the en@@ du@@ ran@@ ce of religi@@ on as a len@@ s through which most people view mor@@ al questions has se@@ par@@ ated most mor@@ al talk from real questions of human and ani@@ mal su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing ."
This is why we spend our time talking about things like g@@ ay mar@@ ri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or nuclear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or po@@ ver@@ ty or any other hu@@ ge@@ ly con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al issue .
But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : We need a uni@@ vers@@ al con@@ cep@@ tion of human val@@ u@@ es .
"Now , what stan@@ ds in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to noti@@ ce is that we do something different when talking about mor@@ ality — es@@ pe@@ cially se@@ cular , ac@@ a@@ demi@@ c , scienti@@ st typ@@ es ."
When talking about mor@@ ality we val@@ ue differ@@ ences of op@@ ini@@ on in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
"So , for in@@ stance the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ ama gets up every morning medi@@ t@@ ating on comp@@ as@@ sion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ ping other human be@@ ings is an inte@@ gra@@ l com@@ pon@@ ent of human happ@@ iness ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy ; T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy was very f@@ ond of ab@@ du@@ cting and ra@@ ping and tor@@ tur@@ ing and kil@@ ling young women ."
"So , we ap@@ pe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ ini@@ on about how to pro@@ fi@@ t@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) Mo@@ st W@@ est@@ er@@ n in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ als look at this situ@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ ama to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy to be really wrong about that ad@@ mi@@ ts of a real ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent that poten@@ ti@@ ally fal@@ ls within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He li@@ k@@ es cho@@ col@@ ate , he li@@ k@@ es v@@ ani@@ l@@ la ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ ade the other . &quot; &quot; N@@ oti@@ ce that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a str@@ ing the@@ ori@@ st .
"If you ask the s@@ mar@@ test physi@@ ci@@ sts around who is the s@@ mar@@ test physi@@ ci@@ st around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I show@@ ed up at a physi@@ cs con@@ fer@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing the@@ ory is bog@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t re@@ son@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I cho@@ se to view the universe at a small scale .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physi@@ ci@@ st ; I don &apos;t understand str@@ ing the@@ ory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy of str@@ ing the@@ ory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to be@@ long to any str@@ ing the@@ ory c@@ lub that would have me as a member .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ ini@@ ons must be ex@@ clu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a dom@@ a@@ in of exper@@ ti@@ se .
That is what it is for know@@ le@@ dge to coun@@ t .
"H@@ ow have we con@@ v@@ in@@ ced ourselves that in the mor@@ al sp@@ here there is no such thing as mor@@ al exper@@ ti@@ se , or mor@@ al tal@@ ent , or mor@@ al g@@ eni@@ us even ? How have we con@@ v@@ in@@ ced our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ ini@@ on has to coun@@ t ? How have we con@@ v@@ in@@ ced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ je@@ cts wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ?
D@@ o@@ es the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an have a point of view on physi@@ cs that is wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ig@@ nor@@ ance any less obvi@@ ous on the sub@@ je@@ ct of human wel@@ l-@@ being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now ."
"It needs people like ourselves to ad@@ m@@ it that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing , and mor@@ ality re@@ lat@@ es to that dom@@ a@@ in of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for individu@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tu@@ res , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have belie@@ f@@ s and de@@ si@@ res that reli@@ ably le@@ ad to need@@ less human su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing ."
J@@ ust ad@@ mi@@ tting this will trans@@ form our di@@ sc@@ our@@ se about mor@@ ality .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies between n@@ ations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world fil@@ led with de@@ stru@@ ctive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ inv@@ en@@ ted ; it will always be e@@ as@@ ier to bre@@ ak things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It seem@@ s to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , pat@@ ently obvi@@ ous that we can no more re@@ spe@@ ct and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in noti@@ ons of human wel@@ l-@@ being than we can re@@ spe@@ ct or t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in the noti@@ ons about how dise@@ ase sp@@ re@@ ads , or in the sa@@ fe@@ ty stan@@ dar@@ ds of buil@@ dings and air@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must con@@ ver@@ ge on the ans@@ w@@ ers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ m@@ it that these questions have ans@@ w@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble materi@@ al there ."
"W@@ he@@ ther in this audience or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , hear@@ ing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ ra@@ ge thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ ang@@ u@@ age seem@@ s to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women dre@@ s@@ sed in c@@ lot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , spo@@ k@@ en with a lot of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a ce@@ le@@ br@@ ation of fe@@ m@@ ale speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a resul@@ t of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is ar@@ gu@@ ably a s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated psycho@@ logi@@ cal view — &quot; that m@@ ale l@@ ust is not to be tru@@ st@@ ed . &quot;"
"I mean , can you eng@@ age in a convers@@ ation with that kind of woman without seem@@ ing kind of cul@@ tu@@ ral im@@ per@@ i@@ ali@@ st ?"
"S@@ am H@@ ar@@ ris : Yeah , well I think I tr@@ ied to bro@@ ach this in a s@@ ent@@ ence , wat@@ ching the clo@@ ck ti@@ c@@ king , but the question is : What is vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary in a con@@ te@@ xt where men have certain expe@@ ct@@ ations , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to we@@ ar a ve@@ il , or a very fun@@ ny h@@ at , or tat@@ too their face — I think we should be f@@ ree to vol@@ un@@ t@@ ari@@ ly do whatever we want , but we have to be hon@@ est about the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that these women are plac@@ ed under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ag@@ er to always take their word for it , es@@ pe@@ cially when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re we@@ aring a full bur@@ q@@ a ."
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of mor@@ al pro@@ gre@@ ss .
But can you re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that ?
"I think I under@@ sto@@ od you to say that you could re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one di@@ men@@ si@@ onal , where we all have to think the same ."
"P@@ a@@ int your picture of what rol@@ ling the clo@@ ck 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , bal@@ an@@ cing mor@@ al pro@@ gre@@ ss with ri@@ ch@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ m@@ it that we are on the pat@@ h tow@@ ard under@@ standing our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important de@@ ta@@ il , then you have to ad@@ m@@ it that we are going to understand all of the posi@@ tive and neg@@ ative qu@@ ali@@ ties of ourselves in much gre@@ ater de@@ ta@@ il ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand posi@@ tive social emoti@@ on like em@@ pa@@ th@@ y and comp@@ as@@ sion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ t@@ ors that en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge it — whether they &apos;re gen@@ e@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and in@@ so@@ far as we beg@@ in to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ evi@@ t@@ ably going to con@@ ver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gra@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my d@@ aughter from bir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ fi@@ dent and wel@@ l-@@ edu@@ c@@ ated in the con@@ te@@ xt of men who do de@@ si@@ re women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that com@@ pul@@ sor@@ y ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone inv@@ olved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
Do people love their d@@ augh@@ ters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ w@@ ers to that .
"CA : And if the resul@@ ts come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ par@@ ed to shi@@ ft your in@@ st@@ in@@ ctive cur@@ r@@ ent ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these issu@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well ye@@ ah , mo@@ du@@ l@@ o one obvi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the con@@ te@@ xt of a tru@@ ly de@@ lu@@ si@@ onal belie@@ f system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my g@@ ay son was going to go to he@@ ll if he found a bo@@ y@@ friend , I ch@@ op@@ ped his head off . And that was the most comp@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those par@@ ts ali@@ g@@ ned , y@@ es I think you could probably be feeling the emoti@@ on of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about wel@@ l-@@ being in a lar@@ ger con@@ te@@ xt ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling e@@ c@@ st@@ asy and then b@@ low@@ ing hi@@ m@@ self up on a bu@@ s ."
"CA : S@@ am , this is a convers@@ ation I would actually love to contin@@ ue for hours ."

G@@ ot@@ t@@ fr@@ ied S@@ ch@@ l@@ au@@ g , one of the pre@@ em@@ in@@ ent neuro@@ scienti@@ sts stu@@ dy@@ ing music and the brain at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , and S@@ ch@@ l@@ au@@ g is a pro@@ pon@@ ent of a ther@@ ap@@ y called Me@@ lo@@ di@@ c In@@ ton@@ ation Th@@ er@@ ap@@ y , which has become very popul@@ ar in music ther@@ ap@@ y now ."
"S@@ ch@@ l@@ au@@ g found that his stro@@ ke vi@@ cti@@ ms who were ap@@ ha@@ si@@ c , could not form s@@ ent@@ ences of thre@@ e@@ - or f@@ our@@ -@@ word s@@ ent@@ ences , but they could still sing the ly@@ ri@@ cs to a s@@ ong , whether it was &quot; &quot; Ha@@ pp@@ y B@@ ir@@ th@@ day To You &quot; &quot; or their fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te s@@ ong by the E@@ ag@@ les or the R@@ ol@@ ling St@@ ones ."
"And after 70 hours of inten@@ sive sing@@ ing l@@ ess@@ ons , he found that the music was able to liter@@ ally re@@ wi@@ re the bra@@ ins of his patients and create a hom@@ o@@ log@@ ous spe@@ e@@ ch cen@@ ter in their right he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here to comp@@ en@@ s@@ ate for the left he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here &apos;s dam@@ age ."
"When I was 1@@ 7 , I visi@@ ted D@@ r. S@@ ch@@ l@@ au@@ g &apos;s la@@ b , and in one af@@ ter@@ no@@ on he wal@@ ked me through some of the le@@ ading research on music and the brain — how musi@@ ci@@ ans had fundam@@ ent@@ ally different brain structure than n@@ on-@@ musi@@ ci@@ ans , how music , and list@@ ening to music , could just light up the entire brain , from our pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x all the way back to our cer@@ e@@ be@@ l@@ lu@@ m , how music was be@@ coming a neu@@ rop@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c mo@@ d@@ ality to help children with au@@ ti@@ sm , to help people stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with stre@@ ss and an@@ x@@ ie@@ ty and de@@ pres@@ sion , how de@@ e@@ ply Par@@ kin@@ s@@ oni@@ an patients would find that their tre@@ mo@@ r and their ga@@ it would ste@@ ady when they list@@ en@@ ed to music ,"
"@@ and how lat@@ e-@@ st@@ age Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s patients , wh@@ ose de@@ men@@ ti@@ a was so far pro@@ gre@@ s@@ sed that they could no longer re@@ cogni@@ ze their family , could still pi@@ ck out a tu@@ ne by Ch@@ op@@ in at the pi@@ ano that they had learned when they were children ."
"But I had an ul@@ ter@@ i@@ or moti@@ ve of visi@@ ting G@@ ot@@ t@@ fr@@ ied S@@ ch@@ l@@ au@@ g , and it was this : that I was at a cro@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ads in my life , trying to cho@@ ose between music and medi@@ cine ."
"I had just comple@@ ted my under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate , and I was working as a research as@@ si@@ st@@ ant at the la@@ b of D@@ en@@ n@@ is S@@ el@@ ko@@ e , stu@@ dy@@ ing Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ ase at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , and I had fal@@ le@@ n in love with neuro@@ science . I wanted to become a sur@@ ge@@ on ."
"I wanted to become a do@@ ctor like P@@ au@@ l F@@ ar@@ m@@ er or Ri@@ ck H@@ o@@ des , these kind of fe@@ ar@@ less men who go into places like Ha@@ it@@ i or E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia and work with AIDS patients with mul@@ ti@@ drug@@ -@@ resi@@ st@@ ant tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , or with children with dis@@ fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing can@@ c@@ ers ."
"I wanted to become that kind of R@@ ed C@@ ross do@@ ctor , that do@@ ctor without bor@@ ders ."
"O@@ n the other hand , I had pla@@ yed the vi@@ o@@ li@@ n my entire life ."
Music for me was more than a pas@@ sion . It was ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion .
"It was o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en . I was lu@@ ck@@ y enough to have stud@@ ied at the Ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard S@@ cho@@ ol in M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an , and to have pla@@ yed my de@@ but with Z@@ u@@ b@@ in Me@@ h@@ ta and the Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li ph@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra in T@@ el A@@ vi@@ v , and it turned out that G@@ ot@@ t@@ fr@@ ied S@@ ch@@ l@@ au@@ g had stud@@ ied as an organi@@ st at the V@@ ien@@ na Con@@ ser@@ v@@ at@@ ory , but had given up his love for music to pur@@ su@@ e a car@@ e@@ er in medi@@ cine . And that af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , I had to ask him , &quot; How was it for you making that deci@@ sion ? &quot;"
"And he said that there were still times when he wi@@ shed he could go back and play the or@@ g@@ an the way he used to , and that for me , medi@@ cal school could wa@@ it , but that the vi@@ o@@ li@@ n simply would not ."
"And after two more years of stu@@ dy@@ ing music , I decided to sho@@ ot for the im@@ possible before taking the M@@ C@@ A@@ T and ap@@ pl@@ ying to medi@@ cal school like a good Indi@@ an son to become the next D@@ r. G@@ up@@ ta . ( Laughter ) And I decided to sho@@ ot for the im@@ possible and I took an au@@ di@@ tion for the est@@ e@@ em@@ ed L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les P@@ h@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic ."
"It was my first au@@ di@@ tion , and after three days of playing behind a scre@@ en in a tri@@ al week , I was of@@ fer@@ ed the posi@@ tion ."
"And it was a dre@@ am . It was a wi@@ ld dre@@ am to per@@ form in an or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra , to per@@ form in the i@@ con@@ ic W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ney Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all in an or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra con@@ du@@ cted now by the fam@@ ous G@@ u@@ sta@@ v@@ o D@@ ud@@ am@@ el , but much more import@@ an@@ tly to me to be sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by musi@@ ci@@ ans and ment@@ ors that became my new family , my new musi@@ cal home ."
"But a year later , I met another musi@@ ci@@ an who had also stud@@ ied at Ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , one who prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly hel@@ ped me find my vo@@ ice and sha@@ ped my iden@@ ti@@ ty as a musi@@ ci@@ an ."
"Na@@ th@@ anie@@ l A@@ y@@ ers was a d@@ ou@@ ble bas@@ si@@ st at Ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , but he su@@ f@@ fer@@ ed a ser@@ ies of psy@@ ch@@ oti@@ c epi@@ so@@ des in his early 20@@ s , was tre@@ ated with th@@ or@@ az@@ ine at B@@ el@@ le@@ v@@ ue , and en@@ ded up living hom@@ el@@ ess on the stre@@ ets of S@@ kid R@@ ow in dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les 30 years later ."
"Na@@ th@@ anie@@ l &apos;s story has become a be@@ ac@@ on for hom@@ el@@ ess@@ ness and ment@@ al health adv@@ oc@@ acy throu@@ gh@@ out the United States , as told through the book and the movie &quot; &quot; The S@@ o@@ lo@@ i@@ st , &quot; &quot; but I became his friend , and I became his vi@@ o@@ li@@ n teach@@ er , and I told him that wh@@ er@@ ever he had his vi@@ o@@ li@@ n , and wh@@ er@@ ever I had m@@ ine , I would play a l@@ es@@ son with him ."
"And on the many times I saw Na@@ th@@ anie@@ l on S@@ kid R@@ ow , I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed how music was able to bring him back from his very dar@@ k@@ est mom@@ ents , from what seem@@ ed to me in my un@@ tra@@ ined ey@@ e to be the begin@@ n@@ ings of a s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ eni@@ c e@@ pis@@ od@@ e ."
"P@@ la@@ ying for Na@@ th@@ anie@@ l , the music took on a de@@ e@@ per me@@ an@@ ing , because now it was about communi@@ cation , a communi@@ cation where words fai@@ led , a communi@@ cation of a mess@@ age that went de@@ e@@ per than words , that regi@@ ster@@ ed at a fundam@@ ent@@ ally pri@@ mal level in Na@@ th@@ anie@@ l &apos;s psy@@ ch@@ e , yet came as a true musi@@ cal of@@ fer@@ ing from me ."
"I found myself grow@@ ing ou@@ tra@@ g@@ ed that someone like Na@@ th@@ anie@@ l could have ever been hom@@ el@@ ess on S@@ kid R@@ ow because of his ment@@ al il@@ l@@ ness , yet how many ten@@ s of thousands of others there were out there on S@@ kid R@@ ow alone who had stories as tra@@ gi@@ c as his , but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the stre@@ ets ?"
"And at the very cor@@ e of this cri@@ sis of m@@ ine , I felt some@@ how the life of music had cho@@ s@@ en me , where some@@ how , per@@ haps possi@@ bly in a very na@@ i@@ ve sense , I felt what S@@ kid R@@ ow really needed was somebody like P@@ au@@ l F@@ ar@@ m@@ er and not another clas@@ si@@ cal musi@@ ci@@ an playing on B@@ un@@ k@@ er Hi@@ ll ."
"But in the end , it was Na@@ th@@ anie@@ l who show@@ ed me that if I was tru@@ ly pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the perfe@@ ct instru@@ ment to do it , that music was the bri@@ dge that conne@@ cted my world and his ."
"There &apos;s a beautiful quot@@ e by the R@@ om@@ an@@ tic G@@ er@@ man com@@ pos@@ er Rob@@ er@@ t S@@ ch@@ um@@ an@@ n , who said , &quot; &quot; To sen@@ d light into the dar@@ k@@ ness of men &apos;s hear@@ ts , such is the du@@ ty of the arti@@ st . &quot; &quot; And this is a parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly po@@ ig@@ n@@ ant quot@@ e because S@@ ch@@ um@@ an@@ n hi@@ m@@ self su@@ f@@ fer@@ ed from s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ enia and d@@ ied in as@@ y@@ lu@@ m ."
"And inspi@@ red by what I learned from Na@@ th@@ anie@@ l , I started an organiz@@ ation on S@@ kid R@@ ow of musi@@ ci@@ ans called St@@ re@@ et Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony , br@@ ing@@ ing the light of music into the very dar@@ k@@ est places , perform@@ ing for the hom@@ el@@ ess and ment@@ ally i@@ ll at sh@@ el@@ ters and c@@ lini@@ cs on S@@ kid R@@ ow , perform@@ ing for com@@ b@@ at ve@@ ter@@ ans with post@@ -@@ tra@@ um@@ atic stre@@ ss di@@ sor@@ der , and for the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated and those la@@ be@@ led as cri@@ min@@ ally in@@ s@@ ane ."
"A@@ f@@ ter one of our ev@@ ents at the P@@ at@@ ton St@@ ate H@@ o@@ spit@@ al in S@@ an B@@ er@@ nar@@ din@@ o , a woman wal@@ ked up to us and she had te@@ ars stre@@ am@@ ing down her face , and she had a pal@@ sy , she was sha@@ king , and she had this gor@@ ge@@ ous smi@@ le , and she said that she had never heard clas@@ si@@ cal music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a vi@@ o@@ li@@ n before , but that hear@@ ing this music was like hear@@ ing the su@@ n@@ sh@@ ine , and that no@@ body ever came to visi@@ t them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she stop@@ ped sha@@ king without medi@@ cation ."
"S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly , what we &apos;re fin@@ ding with these con@@ cer@@ ts , away from the st@@ age , away from the fo@@ ot@@ li@@ ghts , out of the tu@@ x@@ e@@ do ta@@ il@@ s , the musi@@ ci@@ ans become the con@@ du@@ it for deli@@ ver@@ ing the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts of music on the brain to an audience that would never have ac@@ cess to this room , would never have ac@@ cess to the kind of music that we make ."
"J@@ ust as medi@@ cine ser@@ ves to he@@ al more than the building blo@@ cks of the body alone , the power and beau@@ ty of music tran@@ scen@@ ds the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the mi@@ ddle of our be@@ lo@@ ved ac@@ ro@@ n@@ ym ."
Music tran@@ scen@@ ds the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic beau@@ ty alone .
"The syn@@ chro@@ ny of emoti@@ ons that we experience when we hear an op@@ era by W@@ ag@@ ner , or a sym@@ ph@@ ony by Bra@@ h@@ ms , or ch@@ am@@ ber music by Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven , compe@@ ls us to remember our sh@@ ared , common hum@@ ani@@ ty , the de@@ e@@ ply com@@ mu@@ na@@ l conne@@ cted con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness , the em@@ pa@@ th@@ ic con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness that neu@@ rop@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ st I@@ a@@ in M@@ c@@ G@@ il@@ ch@@ ri@@ st says is har@@ d-@@ wi@@ red into our brain &apos;s right he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here ."
"And for those living in the most de@@ hum@@ ani@@ z@@ ing con@@ di@@ tions of ment@@ al il@@ l@@ ness within hom@@ el@@ ess@@ ness and in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , the music and the beau@@ ty of music of@@ f@@ ers a ch@@ ance for them to tran@@ sc@@ end the world around them , to remember that they still have the ca@@ pac@@ ity to experience something beautiful and that hum@@ ani@@ ty has not for@@ got@@ ten them ."
"And the sp@@ ar@@ k of that beau@@ ty , the sp@@ ar@@ k of that hum@@ ani@@ ty trans@@ form@@ s into hope , and we know , whether we cho@@ ose the pat@@ h of music or of medi@@ cine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must in@@ still within our communi@@ ties , within our aud@@ ien@@ ces , if we want to inspi@@ re heal@@ ing from within ."
"I &apos;d like to end with a quot@@ e by Joh@@ n K@@ e@@ ats , the R@@ om@@ an@@ tic En@@ g@@ li@@ sh po@@ et , a very fam@@ ous quot@@ e that I &apos;m sure all of you know ."
"K@@ e@@ ats hi@@ m@@ self had also given up a car@@ e@@ er in medi@@ cine to pur@@ su@@ e po@@ e@@ try , but he d@@ ied when he was a year ol@@ der than me ."
"And K@@ e@@ ats said , &quot; &quot; Be@@ au@@ ty is tru@@ th , and tru@@ th beau@@ ty ."
"That is all y@@ e know on Earth , and all y@@ e need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) ( Applause )"
"Th@@ ank you so much everyone from TED , and Ch@@ ris and A@@ my in particular ."
I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
I have not s@@ lep@@ t in weeks .
"N@@ e@@ il and I were sitting there com@@ par@@ ing how little we &apos;ve s@@ lep@@ t in anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation for this . I &apos;ve never been so ner@@ v@@ ous — and I do this when I &apos;m ner@@ v@@ ous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organiz@@ ation called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ cia , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might jo@@ in in and do si@@ mi@@ lar things ."
"B@@ ack in about 2@@ 000 , I was living in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , I was trying to fin@@ is@@ h my first book , I was wan@@ der@@ ing around d@@ az@@ ed every day because I wro@@ te from 12 a@@ .@@ m@@ . to 5 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
So I would walk around in a da@@ ze during the day .
"I had no ment@@ al ac@@ u@@ ity to speak of during the day , but I had f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble hours ."
"In the B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od that I li@@ ved in , Par@@ k S@@ lo@@ pe , there are a lot of wri@@ ters — it &apos;s like a very high per ca@@ pi@@ ta r@@ ati@@ o of wri@@ ters to nor@@ mal people ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , I had grow@@ n up around a lot of teach@@ ers ."
"My mo@@ m was a teach@@ er , my si@@ ster became a teach@@ er and after colle@@ ge so many of my friends went into teach@@ ing ."
"And so I was always hear@@ ing them talk about their lives and how in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing they were , and they were really sort of the most har@@ d-@@ working and con@@ stan@@ tly in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing people I knew ."
"But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the stru@@ gg@@ les they were de@@ al@@ ing with ."
"And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teach@@ ing in city scho@@ ols were having t@@ rou@@ ble with their students ke@@ e@@ ping up at gra@@ de level , in their re@@ ading and writing in particular ."
"Now , so many of these students had come from hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds where En@@ g@@ li@@ sh isn &apos;t spo@@ k@@ en in the home , where a lot of them have different spe@@ cial needs , lear@@ ning dis@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies . And of course they &apos;re working in scho@@ ols which sometimes and very often are under@@ -@@ fun@@ ded ."
"And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bod@@ ies , more one@@ -@@ on-@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion , more hours , more exper@@ ti@@ se from people that have sk@@ il@@ ls in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh and can work with these students one@@ -@@ on-@@ one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them one@@ -@@ on-@@ one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five clas@@ ses of 30 to 40 students each ."
"This can le@@ ad up to 1@@ 50 , 1@@ 80 , 2@@ 00 students a day ."
How can we possi@@ bly give each stud@@ ent even one hour a week of one@@ -@@ on-@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to gre@@ at@@ ly mul@@ ti@@ ply the wor@@ kwe@@ ek and cl@@ one the teach@@ ers .
And so we started talking about this .
"And at the same time , I thought about this mas@@ sive group of people I knew : wri@@ ters , e@@ di@@ t@@ ors , jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sts , gra@@ du@@ ate students , as@@ si@@ st@@ ant prof@@ es@@ sor@@ s , you name it ."
"A@@ ll these people that had sort of f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble da@@ i@@ ly hours and an inter@@ est in the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh word — I hope to have an inter@@ est in the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh language , but I &apos;m not spe@@ aking it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clo@@ ck has got me ."
"But everyone that I knew had an inter@@ est in the pri@@ m@@ acy of the wri@@ t@@ ten word in terms of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing a de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y , n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing an en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed life ."
"And so they had , you know , their time and their inter@@ est , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a con@@ du@@ it that I knew of in my community to bring these two communi@@ ties together ."
"So when I mo@@ ved back to S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co , we ren@@ ted this building ."
"And the idea was to put M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s — M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s Q@@ u@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly , that we publi@@ shed t@@ wi@@ ce or three times a year , and a few other mag@@ az@@ ines — we were going to move it into an offi@@ ce for the first time ."
It used to be in my k@@ it@@ ch@@ en in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n .
"We were going to move it into an offi@@ ce , and we were going to actually share space with a tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter ."
"So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these wri@@ ters and e@@ di@@ t@@ ors and everybody — sort of a writing community — coming into the offi@@ ce every day any@@ way , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get ex@@ tra help on their wri@@ t@@ ten h@@ ome@@ work , so you have basically no bor@@ der between these two communi@@ ties ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . the students f@@ low in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you tra@@ de , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is ."
You give those hours in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on to the students in the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od .
"So , we had this place , we ren@@ ted it , the land@@ l@@ or@@ d was all for it . We did this mu@@ ral , that &apos;s a Ch@@ ris W@@ are mu@@ ral , that basically expla@@ ins the entire history of the prin@@ ted word , in mu@@ ral form — it takes a long time to di@@ gest and you have to stand in the mi@@ ddle of the ro@@ ad ."
So we ren@@ ted this space .
"And everything was great ex@@ cept the land@@ l@@ or@@ d said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is z@@ on@@ ed for re@@ ta@@ il ; you have to come up with something ."
You &apos;ve got@@ ta se@@ ll something .
"You can &apos;t just have a tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; H@@ a h@@ a ! Re@@ ally ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly to se@@ ll , but we did all the ne@@ cess@@ ary research ."
"It used to be a we@@ ight room , so there were ru@@ b@@ ber flo@@ ors be@@ low , ac@@ ou@@ stic ti@@ le ce@@ il@@ ings and flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent li@@ ghts ."
"We took all that down , and we found beautiful wo@@ o@@ den flo@@ ors , whi@@ te@@ wa@@ shed be@@ am@@ s and it had the look — while we were ren@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hu@@ ll of a ship . &quot;"
"And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should se@@ ll sup@@ pl@@ ies to the working bu@@ c@@ can@@ e@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody l@@ au@@ gh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that ."
Let &apos;s se@@ ll pi@@ r@@ ate sup@@ pl@@ ies . &quot; &quot; This is the pi@@ r@@ ate su@@ pp@@ ly stor@@ e .
"You see , this is sort of a sk@@ et@@ ch I did on a na@@ p@@ k@@ in ."
"A great car@@ pen@@ ter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pi@@ r@@ ate sup@@ pl@@ y@@ -@@ like ."
Here you see plan@@ ks s@@ old by the fo@@ ot and we have sup@@ pl@@ ies to com@@ b@@ at s@@ cur@@ v@@ y .
"We have the pe@@ g le@@ gs there , that are all hand@@ made and fi@@ t@@ ted to you ."
"U@@ p at the top , you see the e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ch disp@@ l@@ ay , which is the black col@@ um@@ n there for every@@ day use for your e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ch , and then you have the pa@@ ste@@ l and other col@@ ors for ste@@ pping out at night — spe@@ cial oc@@ ca@@ sions , b@@ ar mi@@ t@@ z@@ v@@ a@@ h@@ s and whatever ."
So we open@@ ed this place . And this is a v@@ at that we fi@@ ll with tre@@ as@@ ures that students di@@ g in .
This is re@@ plac@@ ement eyes in case you lo@@ se one .
These are some sig@@ ns that we have all over the place : &quot; P@@ rac@@ tical Jo@@ king with P@@ ir@@ ates . &quot;
"W@@ hi@@ le you &apos;re re@@ ading the sig@@ n , we pu@@ ll a rop@@ e behind the coun@@ ter and eight mo@@ p he@@ ads dro@@ p on your head ."
That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that dro@@ ps on people &apos;s he@@ ads .
"It became mo@@ p he@@ ads . And this is the fish the@@ ater , which is just a s@@ al@@ tw@@ ater t@@ ank with three se@@ ats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter ."
"So right there is the tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter , and then behind the cur@@ tain were the M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s offi@@ ces , where all of us would be working on the mag@@ az@@ ine and book e@@ di@@ ting and things like that ."
The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
"We set the place up , we open@@ ed up , we spent months and months ren@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place ."
"We had tab@@ les , cha@@ ir@@ s , compu@@ ters , everything ."
I went to a dot@@ -@@ co@@ m au@@ ction at a H@@ o@@ li@@ day In@@ n in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to and I b@@ ou@@ ght 11 G@@ 4@@ s with a stro@@ ke of a pad@@ d@@ le .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , we b@@ ou@@ ght &apos; em , we set everything up and then we wai@@ ted ."
"It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were wri@@ ters in the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
"And we s@@ at . And at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . we put a s@@ and@@ wi@@ ch bo@@ ard out on the front si@@ de@@ walk and it just said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree T@@ ut@@ or@@ ing for Y@@ our En@@ g@@ li@@ sh@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated and W@@ ri@@ t@@ ing@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated Ne@@ eds — J@@ ust C@@ ome In , It &apos;s All F@@ ree . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to stor@@ m the g@@ ates , they &apos;re g@@ on@@ na love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t ."
"And so we wai@@ ted , we s@@ at at the tab@@ les , we wai@@ ted and wai@@ ted ."
"And everybody was be@@ coming very di@@ sc@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed because it was weeks and weeks that we wai@@ ted , really , where no@@ body came in ."
"And then somebody al@@ er@@ ted us to the fact that maybe there was a tr@@ ust ga@@ p , because we were oper@@ ating behind a pi@@ r@@ ate su@@ pp@@ ly stor@@ e . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?"
"And so then , around that time , I per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed a woman na@@ med N@@ in@@ ev@@ e@@ h C@@ ali@@ gar@@ i , a lon@@ g@@ time S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co edu@@ cat@@ or — she was teach@@ ing in M@@ exi@@ co C@@ ity , she had all the experience ne@@ cess@@ ary , knew everything about education , was conne@@ cted with all the teach@@ ers and community mem@@ bers in the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od — I con@@ v@@ in@@ ced her to move up from M@@ exi@@ co C@@ ity where she was teach@@ ing ."
She took over as ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tive dire@@ ctor .
"I@@ m@@ medi@@ ately , she made the in@@ ro@@ ads with the teach@@ ers and the parents and the students and everything , and so sud@@ den@@ ly it was actually full every day ."
And what we were trying to of@@ f@@ er every day was one@@ -@@ on-@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion .
The go@@ al was to have a one@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ one r@@ ati@@ o with every one of these students .
"You know , it &apos;s been pro@@ ven that 3@@ 5 to 40 hours a year with one@@ -@@ on-@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion , a stud@@ ent can get one gra@@ de level high@@ er ."
"And so most of these students , En@@ g@@ li@@ sh is not spo@@ k@@ en in the home ."
"They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a ch@@ ur@@ ch pe@@ w that I b@@ ou@@ ght in a B@@ er@@ k@@ ele@@ y au@@ ction right there — the parents will sometimes wat@@ ch while their kids are being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"So that was the basi@@ s of it , was one@@ -@@ on-@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion ."
And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
"If you &apos;re on V@@ al@@ en@@ cia St@@ re@@ et within those few blo@@ cks at around 2 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big back@@ pac@@ ks , or whatever , actually ru@@ n@@ ning to this space , which is very str@@ ange , because it &apos;s school , in a way ."
But there was something psycho@@ logi@@ cal happening there that was just a little bit different .
"And the other thing was , there was no sti@@ g@@ ma ."
"K@@ i@@ ds wer@@ en &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; C@@ en@@ ter@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ K@@ i@@ d@@ s@@ -@@ Th@@ at@@ -@@ Ne@@ ed@@ -@@ Mo@@ re@@ -@@ H@@ el@@ p , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ cia ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it was a pi@@ r@@ ate su@@ pp@@ ly stor@@ e , which is in@@ s@@ ane ."
"And then secon@@ d@@ ly , there &apos;s a publi@@ sh@@ ing company in the back ."
"And so our inter@@ ns were actually working at the same tab@@ les very often , and sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , compu@@ ter@@ -@@ ne@@ x@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ computer with the students ."
"And so it became a tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter — publi@@ sh@@ ing cen@@ ter , is what we called it — and a writing cen@@ ter ."
"They go in , and they might be working with a high school stud@@ ent actually working on a no@@ vel — because we had very gi@@ f@@ ted kids , too ."
So there &apos;s no sti@@ g@@ ma .
They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a cre@@ ative en@@ de@@ av@@ or .
They &apos;re seeing ad@@ ul@@ ts . They &apos;re mode@@ ling their behavi@@ or .
"These ad@@ ul@@ ts , they &apos;re working in their fie@@ ld ."
"They can le@@ an over , ask a question of one of these ad@@ ul@@ ts and it all sort of fe@@ eds on each other ."
"There &apos;s a lot of cro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ pol@@ lin@@ ation . The only problem , es@@ pe@@ cially for the ad@@ ul@@ ts working at M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s who ha@@ dn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly b@@ ou@@ ght into all of this when they sig@@ ned up , was that there was just the one ba@@ th@@ room . ( Laughter ) Wi@@ th like 60 kids a day , this is a problem ."
"But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids fini@@ sh@@ ing their h@@ ome@@ work in a given day , working one@@ -@@ on-@@ one , getting all this at@@ ten@@ tion — they go home , they &apos;re fini@@ shed . They don &apos;t st@@ all ."
They don &apos;t do their h@@ ome@@ work in front of the T@@ V .
"They &apos;re allow@@ ed to go home at 5 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , en@@ jo@@ y their family , en@@ jo@@ y other h@@ ob@@ b@@ ies , get outside , play ."
And that makes a happy family .
A bu@@ n@@ ch of happy fam@@ il@@ ies in a neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od is a happy community .
A bu@@ n@@ ch of happy communi@@ ties t@@ ied together is a happy city and a happy world .
"So the key to it all is h@@ ome@@ work ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — one@@ -@@ on-@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion ."
"So we started off with about 12 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundre@@ d ."
"And we now have 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers on our ro@@ ster ."
And we make it incredi@@ bly e@@ asy to vol@@ un@@ te@@ er .
"The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a mon@@ th , those two hours sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , next to one stud@@ ent , con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated at@@ ten@@ tion , sh@@ ining this be@@ am of light on their work , on their thou@@ ghts and their self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , is going to be absolu@@ tely trans@@ form@@ ative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before ."
"So we said , &quot; &quot; E@@ ven if you have two hours one S@@ un@@ day every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s par@@ tly why the tu@@ tor cor@@ ps gre@@ w so f@@ ast ."
"Th@@ en we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . ? &quot; &quot; So we started br@@ ing@@ ing in clas@@ ses during the day ."
"So every day , there &apos;s a fie@@ ld tri@@ p where they together create a book — you can see it being ty@@ ped up ab@@ o@@ ve ."
This is one of the clas@@ ses getting way too exci@@ ted about writing .
"You just point a cam@@ era at a clas@@ s , and it always looks like this ."
So this is one of the boo@@ ks that they do .
"N@@ oti@@ ce the ti@@ tle of the book , &quot; The B@@ ook That W@@ as N@@ ever Ch@@ e@@ cked O@@ u@@ t : T@@ it@@ ani@@ c . &quot;"
"And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce there was a book na@@ med C@@ in@@ dy that was about the T@@ it@@ ani@@ c . &quot; &quot; So , me@@ an@@ while , there &apos;s an ad@@ ul@@ t in the back ty@@ ping this up , taking it completely seri@@ ously , which b@@ low@@ s their mind ."
So then we still had more tu@@ t@@ ors to use .
This is a sh@@ ot of just some of the tu@@ t@@ ors during one of the ev@@ ents .
The teach@@ ers that we work with — and everything is different to teach@@ ers — they tell us what to do .
"We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , completely mal@@ le@@ able . You &apos;re going to tell us ."
"The neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us ."
"The teach@@ ers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most us@@ e@@ ful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the scho@@ ols ?"
"Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly , who don &apos;t have really ac@@ tive parents that are br@@ ing@@ ing them in , or ar@@ en &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 people on our tu@@ tor ro@@ ster ."
"L@@ et &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teach@@ er will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tu@@ t@@ ors for the next five S@@ un@@ days ."
"We &apos;re working on our colle@@ ge es@@ says . S@@ end them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wi@@ re : 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 tu@@ t@@ ors ."
Wh@@ o@@ ever can make it sig@@ ns up . They go in about a half an hour before the clas@@ s .
"The teach@@ er tel@@ ls them what to do , how to do it , what their tra@@ ining is , what their project is so far ."
"They work under the teach@@ er &apos;s gu@@ i@@ de , and it &apos;s all in one big room ."
"And that &apos;s actually the bru@@ n@@ t of what we do is , people going stra@@ ight from their wor@@ k@@ place , stra@@ ight from home , stra@@ ight into the clas@@ s@@ room and working dire@@ ct@@ ly with the students ."
So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
"Th@@ en another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a clas@@ s@@ room and you can st@@ af@@ f it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the E@@ ver@@ et@@ t Mi@@ ddle S@@ cho@@ ol W@@ ri@@ ters &apos; Ro@@ om , where we de@@ cor@@ ated it in bu@@ c@@ can@@ e@@ er sty@@ le ."
It &apos;s right off the li@@ br@@ ary . And there we ser@@ ve all 5@@ 2@@ 9 kids in this mi@@ ddle school .
"This is their ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er , the &quot; &quot; S@@ tra@@ igh@@ t-@@ U@@ p N@@ ew@@ s , &quot; &quot; that has an on@@ going col@@ um@@ n from Ma@@ y@@ or G@@ av@@ in N@@ ew@@ so@@ m in both langu@@ ages — En@@ g@@ li@@ sh and S@@ p@@ ani@@ sh ."
"So then one day I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ len@@ de wro@@ te to us and said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why don &apos;t you as@@ sig@@ n a book with high school students ?"
"I want them to write about how to ach@@ ie@@ ve pe@@ ace in a viol@@ ent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Th@@ ur@@ good Mar@@ sh@@ all Hi@@ gh S@@ cho@@ ol , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment to the students ."
"And we said , &quot; &quot; I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ len@@ de is going to read all your es@@ says at the end ."
She &apos;s going to publi@@ sh them in a book .
She &apos;s going to spon@@ s@@ or the prin@@ ting of this book in pa@@ per@@ back form .
"It &apos;s going to be available in all the bo@@ ok@@ sto@@ res in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a and throu@@ gh@@ out the world , on A@@ ma@@ z@@ on and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audience , there was I@@ sa@@ be@@ l Al@@ len@@ de on the other end ."
I think we had about 1@@ 70 tu@@ t@@ ors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredi@@ bly well .
We had a big par@@ ty at the end .
This is a book that you can find any@@ where . So that led to a ser@@ ies of these .
"You can see A@@ my T@@ an spon@@ so@@ red the next one , &quot; I M@@ ight G@@ et S@@ ome@@ where . &quot;"
And this became an on@@ going thing . M@@ ore and more boo@@ ks .
Now we &apos;re sort of ad@@ di@@ cted to the book thing .
"The kids will work har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be per@@ man@@ ent , know it &apos;s going to be on a sh@@ el@@ f , know that no@@ body can di@@ min@@ is@@ h what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve hon@@ o@@ red their words , hon@@ o@@ red their thou@@ ghts with hundre@@ ds of hours of five dra@@ f@@ ts , six dra@@ f@@ ts — all this at@@ ten@@ tion that we give to their thou@@ ghts ."
"And once they ach@@ ie@@ ve that level , once they &apos;ve wri@@ t@@ ten at that level , they can never go back ."
It &apos;s absolu@@ tely trans@@ form@@ ative .
And so then they &apos;re all s@@ old in the stor@@ e . This is ne@@ ar the plan@@ ks .
We se@@ ll all the stud@@ ent boo@@ ks .
"W@@ here else would you put them , right ?"
"So we se@@ ll &apos; em , and then something we@@ ird had been happening with the sto@@ res . The stor@@ e , actually — even though we started out as just a ga@@ g — the stor@@ e actually made money ."
So it was pa@@ ying the r@@ ent .
"And maybe this is just a S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to ju@@ dge ."
But people would come in — and this was before the pi@@ r@@ ate mov@@ ies and everything !
"It was making a lot of money . N@@ ot a lot of money , but it was pa@@ ying the r@@ ent , pa@@ ying a fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time st@@ af@@ f member there ."
There &apos;s the ocean ma@@ ps you can see on the left .
And it became a g@@ ate@@ way to the community .
"P@@ e@@ ople would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?"
What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to s@@ we@@ ar on the we@@ b . ( Laughter ) Is that a ru@@ le ? I don &apos;t know .
"They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it ."
"And then right be@@ y@@ ond — there &apos;s usu@@ ally a little cha@@ in there — right be@@ y@@ ond , they would see the kids being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"This is a fie@@ ld tri@@ p going on . And so they would be sh@@ op@@ ping , and they might be more li@@ ke@@ ly to bu@@ y some lar@@ d , or mi@@ l@@ let for their par@@ ro@@ t , or , you know , a ho@@ ok , or ho@@ ok prote@@ ctor for ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time , all of these things we se@@ ll ."
So the stor@@ e actually did really well .
"But it brought in so many people — teach@@ ers , d@@ on@@ ors , vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , everybody — because it was stre@@ et level . It was open to the public ."
"It wasn &apos;t a n@@ on-@@ prof@@ it bur@@ ied , you know , on the 3@@ 0@@ th flo@@ or of some building dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n . It was right in the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od that it was ser@@ ving , and it was open all the time to the public ."
"So , it became this sort of we@@ ird , happy ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So all the people I used to know in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;"
"And a lot of them had been form@@ er edu@@ cat@@ ors or w@@ ou@@ l@@ d-@@ be edu@@ cat@@ ors , so they com@@ b@@ ined with a lot of local desig@@ n@@ ers , local wri@@ ters , and they just took the idea in@@ depen@@ d@@ ently and they did their own thing ."
They didn &apos;t want to se@@ ll pi@@ r@@ ate sup@@ pl@@ ies .
They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
"So , know@@ ing the cri@@ me@@ -@@ fi@@ gh@@ ting community in New York , they open@@ ed the B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n Su@@ per@@ her@@ o Su@@ pp@@ ly C@@ om@@ p@@ any ."
This is S@@ am Pot@@ ts &apos; great design that did this .
"And this was to make it look sort of like one of those ke@@ y@@ smi@@ th &apos;s sh@@ op@@ s that has to have every ser@@ vice they &apos;ve ever of@@ fer@@ ed , you know , all over there ."
"So they open@@ ed this place . In@@ side , it &apos;s like a C@@ ost@@ co for super@@ her@@ o@@ es — all the sup@@ pl@@ ies in kind of basi@@ c form ."
These are all hand@@ made .
"These are all sort of re@@ pur@@ posed other produ@@ cts , or whatever ."
All the pac@@ k@@ ag@@ ing is done by S@@ am Pot@@ ts .
"So then you have the vi@@ l@@ la@@ in con@@ tain@@ ment uni@@ t , where kids put their parents . You have the offi@@ ce ."
"This is a little v@@ au@@ l@@ t — you have to put your produ@@ ct in there , it goes up an electri@@ c li@@ ft and then the guy behind the coun@@ ter tel@@ ls you that you have to re@@ ci@@ te the v@@ ow of her@@ o@@ is@@ m , which you do , if you want to bu@@ y anything . And it li@@ mi@@ ts , really , their s@@ al@@ es ."
"P@@ er@@ son@@ ally , I think it &apos;s a problem ."
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
These are some of the produ@@ cts . These are all hand@@ made .
This is a se@@ cre@@ t iden@@ ti@@ ty k@@ it .
"If you want to take on the iden@@ ti@@ ty of S@@ ha@@ ro@@ n Bo@@ one , one American fe@@ m@@ ale marke@@ ting ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tive from H@@ ob@@ ok@@ en , New J@@ er@@ se@@ y . It &apos;s a full do@@ s@@ sie@@ r on everything you would need to know about S@@ ha@@ ro@@ n Bo@@ one ."
"So , this is the ca@@ per@@ y where you get fi@@ t@@ ted for your cape , and then you walk up these three ste@@ el@@ -@@ gra@@ ded ste@@ ps and then we turn on three hy@@ dra@@ uli@@ c f@@ ans from every side and then you can see the cape in action ."
"There &apos;s nothing wor@@ se than , you know , getting up there and the cape is bu@@ n@@ ching up or something like that ."
"So then , the se@@ cre@@ t door — this is one of the sh@@ el@@ ves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it s@@ low@@ ly open@@ s ."
You can see it there in the mi@@ ddle next to all the gra@@ p@@ pl@@ ing ho@@ o@@ ks .
It open@@ s and then this is the tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full effe@@ ct !
"But this is — I just want to em@@ p@@ ha@@ size — lo@@ cally fun@@ ded , lo@@ cally built ."
"A@@ ll the desig@@ n@@ ers , all of the buil@@ ders , everybody was local , all the time was pro@@ -@@ b@@ ono ."
"I just came and visi@@ ted and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five bo@@ rou@@ gh@@ s of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tu@@ tor@@ ing hours ."
"It &apos;s very bus@@ y . S@@ ame prin@@ ci@@ ples : one@@ -@@ on-@@ one at@@ ten@@ tion , comple@@ te de@@ v@@ oti@@ on to the students &apos; work and a b@@ oun@@ d@@ less op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m and sort of a possi@@ bility of cre@@ ati@@ vity and ideas ."
"And this s@@ wit@@ ch is f@@ lic@@ ked in their he@@ ads when they walk through those 18 fe@@ et of this bi@@ zar@@ re stor@@ e , right ?"
"So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school ."
"It &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly not school , even though they &apos;re working sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der on tab@@ les , pen@@ ci@@ ls and pa@@ per@@ s , whatever ."
"This is one of the students , K@@ hal@@ ed H@@ am@@ d@@ an ."
You can read this quot@@ e .
A@@ d@@ di@@ cted to video g@@ am@@ es and T@@ V . C@@ ouldn &apos;t con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate at home .
C@@ ame in . G@@ ot this con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated at@@ ten@@ tion .
And he couldn &apos;t es@@ cape it .
"So , so@@ on enough , he was writing . He would fin@@ is@@ h his h@@ ome@@ work early — got really ad@@ di@@ cted to fini@@ sh@@ ing his h@@ ome@@ work early ."
"It &apos;s an ad@@ di@@ ctive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it che@@ cked , and to know he &apos;s going to ach@@ ie@@ ve the next thing and be pre@@ par@@ ed for school the next day ."
"So he got ho@@ o@@ ked on that , and then he started doing other things ."
He &apos;s now been publi@@ shed in five boo@@ ks .
"He co@@ -@@ wro@@ te a mo@@ ck@@ um@@ ent@@ ary about fai@@ led super@@ her@@ o@@ es called &quot; &quot; Su@@ per@@ -@@ H@@ as@@ -@@ Be@@ ens . &quot; &quot; He wro@@ te a ser@@ ies on &quot; &quot; P@@ en@@ gu@@ in B@@ al@@ bo@@ a , &quot; &quot; which is a fi@@ gh@@ ting — a bo@@ x@@ ing — pen@@ gu@@ in ."
"And then he read al@@ ou@@ d just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony S@@ p@@ ace , at a b@@ en@@ ef@@ it for 8@@ 2@@ 6 New York . So he &apos;s there every day ."
He &apos;s ev@@ ang@@ e@@ li@@ cal about it . He br@@ ings his cou@@ s@@ ins in now .
There &apos;s four family mem@@ bers that come in every day .
"So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly ."
"This is L@@ .@@ A@@ . , The E@@ ch@@ o Par@@ k Ti@@ me T@@ ra@@ vel Mar@@ t : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en@@ ever You A@@ re , We &apos;re Al@@ ready Th@@ en . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven for time tra@@ v@@ el@@ ers ."
So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven would be .
Le@@ ech@@ es . M@@ am@@ mot@@ h ch@@ un@@ ks . They even have their own S@@ lu@@ r@@ pe@@ e mach@@ ine : &quot; &quot; O@@ u@@ t of O@@ r@@ der . C@@ ome B@@ ack Y@@ est@@ er@@ day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) An@@ y@@ way . So I &apos;m going to j@@ um@@ p a@@ head .
"These are sp@@ ac@@ es that are only af@@ fi@@ li@@ ated with us , doing this same thing : Wor@@ d St@@ . in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ fie@@ ld , M@@ as@@ s@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts ; In@@ k S@@ po@@ t in C@@ in@@ cin@@ nat@@ i ; Y@@ outh S@@ pe@@ ak@@ s , S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co , C@@ alifor@@ nia , which inspi@@ red us ; S@@ tu@@ di@@ o St@@ .

Now I &apos;m going to the TED W@@ is@@ h — is that o@@ kay ?
"A@@ ll right , I &apos;ve got a minu@@ te . So , the TED W@@ is@@ h : I wi@@ sh that you — you per@@ son@@ ally and every cre@@ ative individu@@ al and organiz@@ ation you know — will find a way to dire@@ ct@@ ly eng@@ age with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got inv@@ olved , so that within a year we have a thous@@ and exam@@ ples — a thous@@ and ! — of trans@@ form@@ ative part@@ ner@@ ships ."
Pro@@ found le@@ ap@@ s forward !
And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
"I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and inspi@@ re others on the we@@ b@@ site ."
We created a we@@ b@@ site .
"I &apos;m going to s@@ wit@@ ch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the at@@ ten@@ de@@ es of this con@@ fer@@ ence will us@@ her in a new era of parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation in our public scho@@ ols ."
We hope that you will take the le@@ ad in part@@ ner@@ ing your in@@ no@@ v@@ ative sp@@ ir@@ it and exper@@ ti@@ se with that of in@@ no@@ v@@ ative edu@@ cat@@ ors in your community .
Al@@ ways let the teach@@ ers le@@ ad the way .
They will tell you how to be us@@ e@@ ful . I hope that you &apos;ll ste@@ p in and help out .
There are a million ways .
You can walk up to your local school and con@@ sul@@ t with the teach@@ ers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
"So , this is with H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o in S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co , they did this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al job ."
"This we@@ b@@ site is already up , it &apos;s already got a bu@@ n@@ ch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce U@@ po@@ n a S@@ cho@@ ol , &quot; &quot; which is a great ti@@ tle , I think ."
"This site will do@@ cu@@ ment every story , every project that comes out of this con@@ fer@@ ence and around the world . So you go to the we@@ b@@ site , you see a bu@@ n@@ ch of ideas you can be inspi@@ red by and then you ad@@ d your own proje@@ cts once you get started ."
"H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o did a great job in a very ti@@ ght de@@ ad@@ line . So , visi@@ t the site ."
"If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our dire@@ ctor of national progra@@ ms . He &apos;ll be on the phone ."
"You e@@ ma@@ il him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possi@@ bly want ."
And he &apos;ll get you inspi@@ red and get you going and gu@@ i@@ de you through the process so that you can af@@ fe@@ ct change .
And it can be fun ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it need@@ n &apos;t be st@@ eri@@ le . It need@@ n &apos;t be bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ r@@ ati@@ cally un@@ ten@@ able .
You can do and use the sk@@ il@@ ls that you have .
The scho@@ ols need you . The teach@@ ers need you .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents and parents need you . They need your ac@@ tu@@ al person : your physi@@ cal per@@ son@@ ho@@ od and your open min@@ ds and open ear@@ s and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less comp@@ as@@ sion , sitting next to them , list@@ ening and no@@ d@@ ding and as@@ king questions for hours at a time ."
S@@ ome of these kids just don &apos;t pla@@ in know how good they are : how s@@ mar@@ t and how much they have to say .
"You can tell them . You can sh@@ ine that light on them , one human inter@@ action at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll jo@@ in us ."
Thank you so much .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
And I say &quot; &quot; th@@ ank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was sil@@ ent for 1@@ 7 years .
"And the first words that I spo@@ ke were in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , on the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth D@@ ay ."
And my family and friends had ga@@ ther@@ ed there to hear me speak .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audience , she j@@ um@@ ped up , &quot; H@@ al@@ le@@ lu@@ j@@ ah , Joh@@ n@@ ny ’ s talking ! &quot;"
"( Laughter ) I@@ mag@@ ine if you were qu@@ ie@@ t for 1@@ 7 years and your mother was out in the audience , say ."
"My d@@ ad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll expla@@ in that ."
But I turned around because I didn ’ t re@@ cogni@@ ze where my vo@@ ice was coming from .
"I ha@@ dn ’ t heard my vo@@ ice in 1@@ 7 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;"
"And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of l@@ augh@@ ed ."
"And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is c@@ razy . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this jour@@ ney ."
"And the jour@@ ney , I believe , is a me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or for all of our jour@@ ne@@ ys ."
"E@@ ven though this one is kind of un@@ usu@@ al , I want you to think about your own jour@@ ney ."
"My jour@@ ney began in 19@@ 7@@ 1 when I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed two oil tan@@ k@@ ers col@@ li@@ de b@@ ene@@ ath the G@@ ol@@ den G@@ ate , and a half a million gal@@ l@@ ons of oil sp@@ il@@ led into the b@@ ay ."
It di@@ st@@ urb@@ ed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in mot@@ ori@@ zed ve@@ hi@@ cles .
That ’ s a big thing in C@@ alifor@@ nia .
"And it was a big thing in my little community of Po@@ int R@@ eyes St@@ ation in In@@ ver@@ ness , C@@ alifor@@ nia , because there were only about 3@@ 50 people there in the win@@ ter – this was back in &apos; 7@@ 1 now ."
"And so when I came in and I started wal@@ king around , people — they just knew what was going on ."
"And people would dri@@ ve up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; Joh@@ n , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m wal@@ king for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re wal@@ king to make us look bad , right ?"
"You ’ re wal@@ king to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some tru@@ th to that , because I thought that if I started wal@@ king , everyone would fol@@ low ."
"Because of the oil , everybody tal@@ ked about the pol@@ l@@ lu@@ tion ."
"And so I ar@@ gu@@ ed with people about that , I ar@@ gu@@ ed and I ar@@ gu@@ ed ."
I called my parents up .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in cars . &quot; &quot; My d@@ ad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then ."
They ’ re back in P@@ h@@ il@@ a@@ de@@ l@@ phi@@ a .
"And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ thers are like that ."
"And so , on my 2@@ 7@@ th bir@@ th@@ day I decided , because I ar@@ gu@@ ed so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop spe@@ aking for just one day — one day — to give it a rest ."
And so I did .
I got up in the morning and I didn ’ t say a word .
"And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began list@@ ening — in a long time ."
"And what I heard , it kind of di@@ st@@ urb@@ ed me ."
"Because what I used to do , when I thought I was list@@ ening , was I would list@@ en just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I stop@@ ped list@@ ening ."
"And in my mind , I just kind of rac@@ ed a@@ head and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still fini@@ sh@@ ing up ."
And then I would la@@ un@@ ch in .
"Well , that just en@@ ded communi@@ cation ."
So on this first day I actually list@@ en@@ ed .
"And it was very sa@@ d for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been lear@@ ning ."
I was 2@@ 7 . I thought I knew everything .
I didn ’ t .
"And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I pro@@ mis@@ ed myself for a year I would keep qu@@ ie@@ t because I started lear@@ ning more and more and I needed to learn more ."
"So for a year I said I would keep qu@@ ie@@ t , and then on my bir@@ th@@ day I would reas@@ s@@ ess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again ."
"Well , that la@@ st@@ ed 1@@ 7 years ."
"Now during that time — those 1@@ 7 years — I wal@@ ked and I pla@@ yed the ban@@ j@@ o and I pain@@ ted and I wro@@ te in my jour@@ na@@ l , and I tr@@ ied to study the environment by re@@ ading boo@@ ks ."
And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
"I wal@@ ked up to A@@ sh@@ land , O@@ re@@ g@@ on , where they were of@@ fer@@ ing an environ@@ ment@@ al stud@@ ies de@@ gre@@ e ."
It ’ s only 500 miles .
"And I went into the Re@@ gi@@ stra@@ r ’ s offi@@ ce and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;"
I had a ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er cli@@ pping .
"&quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?"
You don ’ t … ?
We have a spe@@ cial program for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
"And in those two years , I gra@@ du@@ ated with my first de@@ gre@@ e — a bac@@ he@@ lor ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ."
"And my father came out , he was so pro@@ u@@ d ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , we ’ re really pro@@ u@@ d of you son , but what are you going to do with a bac@@ he@@ lor ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ?"
"You don ’ t ri@@ de in cars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hun@@ ched my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , I pi@@ cked my back@@ p@@ ack up again and I started wal@@ king ."
"I wal@@ ked all the way up to P@@ or@@ t T@@ ow@@ n@@ sen@@ d , W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , where I built a wo@@ o@@ den boat , ro@@ de it across P@@ u@@ get S@@ ound and wal@@ ked across W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton &#91; to &#93; I@@ da@@ h@@ o and down to M@@ is@@ s@@ ou@@ la , M@@ on@@ t@@ ana ."
I had wri@@ t@@ ten the Uni@@ versity of M@@ on@@ t@@ ana two years ear@@ lie@@ r and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
( Laughter ) And I was there . I show@@ ed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really hel@@ ped me .
There are two stories in M@@ on@@ t@@ ana .
The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sig@@ n I used a lot .
"And they said , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that . &quot; &quot; The dire@@ ctor of the program said , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome back tom@@ or@@ row . &quot; &quot; He gave me 1@@ 50 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Re@@ gi@@ ster for one cre@@ d@@ it ."
"You ’ re going to go to S@@ outh America , ar@@ en ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Ri@@ ver@@ s and l@@ ak@@ es , the hy@@ dro@@ logi@@ cal systems , S@@ outh America ."
So I did that .
"He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK Joh@@ n , now that you &apos;ve regi@@ ster@@ ed for that one cre@@ d@@ it , you can have a key to an offi@@ ce , you can mat@@ ri@@ cul@@ ate — you ’ re mat@@ ri@@ cu@@ lat@@ ing , so you can use the li@@ br@@ ary ."
"And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the prof@@ es@@ sor@@ s al@@ low you to go to clas@@ s ."
"They ’ re going to sa@@ ve your gra@@ de , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can regi@@ ster for that clas@@ s and they ’ ll give you the gra@@ de . &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , they don ’ t do that in gra@@ du@@ ate scho@@ ols , I don ’ t think ."
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
"They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way ."
"And during that time , I actually t@@ au@@ ght clas@@ ses without spe@@ aking ."
I had 1@@ 3 students when I first wal@@ ked into the clas@@ s .
"I expla@@ ined , with a friend who could inter@@ pre@@ t my sig@@ n language , that I was Joh@@ n Fran@@ c@@ is , I was wal@@ king around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here inter@@ pre@@ ting for me ."
All the students s@@ at around and they went ...
"( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the s@@ che@@ du@@ le , to see when they could get out ."
They had to take that clas@@ s with me .
"T@@ wo weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our clas@@ s ."
And I learned in that clas@@ s — because I would do things like this ...
"@@ and they were all ga@@ ther@@ ed around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear cu@@ tting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear cu@@ tting . &quot;"
"&quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear cu@@ tting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a hand@@ saw . &quot;"
"&quot; Well , you can ’ t c@@ lear@@ cut with a ... &quot;"
"&quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;"
"&quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about se@@ le@@ ctive fore@@ stry . &quot;"
Now this was a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion clas@@ s and we were having a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion .
"I just bac@@ ked out of that , you know , and I just kind of ke@@ pt the fi@@ sts from fl@@ ying ."
"But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sig@@ n and they said things that I absolu@@ tely did not mean , but I should have ."
"And so what came to me is , if you were a teach@@ er and you were teach@@ ing , if you wer@@ en ’ t lear@@ ning you probably wer@@ en ’ t teach@@ ing very well ."
And so I went on .
"My d@@ ad came out to see me gra@@ du@@ ate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really pro@@ u@@ d of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving and start talking ."
"What are you going to do with a ma@@ ster ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ? &quot; &quot; I hun@@ ched my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , I got my back@@ p@@ ack and I went on to the Uni@@ versity of W@@ is@@ consi@@ n ."
I spent two years there writing on oil sp@@ il@@ ls .
No one was interested in oil sp@@ il@@ ls .
But something happened — E@@ x@@ x@@ on V@@ al@@ de@@ z .
And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil sp@@ il@@ ls .
My d@@ ad came out again .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ri@@ de in cars , you don ’ t talk ."
"My si@@ ster said maybe I should leave you alone , because you se@@ em to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my back@@ p@@ ack again ."
"I put my ban@@ j@@ o on and I wal@@ ked all the way to the E@@ ast Co@@ ast , put my fo@@ ot in the At@@ lan@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States ."
"And on Earth D@@ ay , 199@@ 0 — the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth D@@ ay — that ’ s when I began to speak ."
"And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that t@@ ree in the fore@@ st fal@@ ling ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?"
"And I ’ m th@@ an@@ king you , and I &apos;m th@@ an@@ king my family because they had come to hear me speak ."
And that ’ s communi@@ cation .
And they also t@@ au@@ ght me about list@@ ening — that they list@@ en@@ ed to me .
"And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the sil@@ ence , the list@@ ening to each other ."
"R@@ e@@ ally , very important — we need to list@@ en to each other ."
"Well , my jour@@ ney ke@@ pt going on ."
"My d@@ ad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go ."
"I worked for the Co@@ ast@@ gu@@ ard , was made a U.@@ N@@ . Go@@ od@@ will Am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ or ."
"I wro@@ te regu@@ l@@ ations for the United States — I mean , I wro@@ te oil spi@@ ll regu@@ l@@ ations ."
"@@ 20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; Joh@@ n , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;"
"&quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; You just start wal@@ king e@@ ast ; get out of your car and just start wal@@ king e@@ ast . &quot; &quot; And as I wal@@ ked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and sh@@ u@@ t up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , bud@@ dy . &quot;"
"H@@ ow could that be , how could that be ?"
How could doing such a simple thing like wal@@ king and not talking make a difference ?
"Well , my time at the Co@@ ast G@@ u@@ ard was a really good time ."
"And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sa@@ il@@ boat and I sa@@ i@@ led down to the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , and wal@@ ked through all of the is@@ l@@ ands , and to V@@ ene@@ zu@@ el@@ a ."
"And you know , I for@@ got the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you ."
I started talking because I had stud@@ ied environment .
"I ’ d stud@@ ied environment at this form@@ al level , but there was this inform@@ al level ."
"And the inform@@ al level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are ."
And environment changed from just being about tre@@ es and bir@@ ds and en@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed species to being about how we tre@@ ated each other .
"Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we tre@@ at ourselves and how we tre@@ at each other ."
And so that ’ s the mess@@ age that I had .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to sp@@ read that mess@@ age . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sa@@ il@@ boat , sa@@ i@@ led all the way through the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an — it wasn &apos;t really my sa@@ il@@ boat , I kind of worked on that boat — got to V@@ ene@@ zu@@ el@@ a and I started wal@@ king ."
"This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ri@@ de in mot@@ ori@@ zed ve@@ hi@@ cles ."
"I was wal@@ king through E@@ l D@@ or@@ a@@ do — it &apos;s a pri@@ son tow@@ n , fam@@ ous pri@@ son , or in@@ fam@@ ous pri@@ son — in V@@ ene@@ zu@@ el@@ a , and I don ’ t know what pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed me , because this was not like me ."
"There I am , wal@@ king past the gu@@ ard g@@ ate and the gu@@ ard stop@@ s and says , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ a@@ por@@ te , pas@@ a@@ por@@ te , &quot; &quot; and with an M@@ 16 poin@@ ted at me ."
"And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ spor@@ t , hu@@ h ?"
I don &apos;t need to show you my pas@@ spor@@ t . It ’ s in the back of my p@@ ack .
I &apos;m D@@ r. Fran@@ c@@ is ; I &apos;m a U.@@ N@@ . Am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ or and I &apos;m wal@@ king around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started wal@@ king off .
What pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed me to say this thing ?
The ro@@ ad turned into the j@@ un@@ g@@ le .
I didn ’ t get sh@@ ot .
"And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree at last — th@@ ank God Al@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty , I ’ m f@@ ree at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?"
"It took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a pri@@ son@@ er ."
I was a pri@@ son@@ er and I needed to es@@ cape .
The pri@@ son that I was in was the fact that I did not dri@@ ve or use mot@@ ori@@ zed ve@@ hi@@ cles .
Now how could that be ?
"Because when I started , it seem@@ ed very appro@@ pri@@ ate to me not to use mot@@ ori@@ zed ve@@ hi@@ cles ."
"But the thing that was different was that every bir@@ th@@ day , I asked myself about sil@@ ence , but I never asked myself about my deci@@ sion to just use my fe@@ et ."
I had no idea I was going to become a U.@@ N@@ . Am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ or .
I had no idea I would have a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ .
"And so I realized that I had a respon@@ si@@ bility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change ."
"You know , we can do it ."
I was going to have to change .
"And I was af@@ ra@@ id to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just wal@@ ked ."
I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
But I know I needed to .
"I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today ."
"And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve got@@ ten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go ."
"And we kind of have to leave behind the secu@@ ri@@ ty of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are be@@ coming ."
"And so , I want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any pri@@ son that you might find yourself in , as comfor@@ table as it may be , because we have to do something now ."
We have to change now .
"As our form@@ er V@@ ice P@@ resi@@ dent said , we have to become acti@@ vi@@ sts ."
"So if my vo@@ ice can tou@@ ch you , if my ac@@ tions can tou@@ ch you , if my being here can tou@@ ch you , ple@@ ase let it be ."
And I know that all of you have tou@@ ched me while I ’ ve been here .
"So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this car@@ ing , this love , this re@@ spe@@ ct that we ’ ve sh@@ own each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world ."
"Because we are the environment , and how we tre@@ at each other is really how we ’ re going to tre@@ at the environment ."
So I want to th@@ ank you for being here and I want to end this in five secon@@ ds of sil@@ ence .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the lat@@ est e@@ pis@@ od@@ e of Indi@@ a &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — lon@@ gest ru@@ n@@ ning so@@ a@@ p op@@ era , which is cri@@ ck@@ et ."
"And may it run fore@@ ver , because it gi@@ ves people like me a living ."
"It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a nor@@ mal so@@ a@@ p op@@ era to want : It &apos;s got love , jo@@ y , happ@@ iness , s@@ ad@@ ness , te@@ ars , l@@ aughter , lots of de@@ ce@@ it , in@@ tri@@ gu@@ e ."
"And like all good so@@ ap@@ s , it j@@ um@@ ps 20 years when the audience inter@@ est chang@@ es ."
And that &apos;s exactly what cri@@ ck@@ et has done .
It &apos;s j@@ um@@ ped 20 years into 20@@ -@@ over g@@ ame .
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change le@@ ads to a very big re@@ v@@ olution ."
But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
C@@ ri@@ ck@@ et wasn &apos;t always this spe@@ ed@@ -@@ dri@@ ven gener@@ ations g@@ ame .
"There was a time when you pla@@ yed cri@@ ck@@ et , you pla@@ yed ti@@ me@@ less test mat@@ ch@@ es , when you pla@@ yed on ti@@ ll the g@@ ame got over ."
And there was this g@@ ame in Mar@@ ch 19@@ 3@@ 9 that started on the third of Mar@@ ch and en@@ ded on the 1@@ 4@@ th of Mar@@ ch .
"And it only en@@ ded because the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh cri@@ c@@ ke@@ ters had to go from D@@ urb@@ an to C@@ ap@@ e T@@ own , which is a two@@ -@@ hour tra@@ in jour@@ ney , to cat@@ ch the ship that left on the 1@@ 7@@ th , because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time ."
"So , the mat@@ ch was en@@ ded in between ."
"And one of the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh bat@@ s@@ men said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
A@@ no@@ ther half an hour and we would have won . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A@@ no@@ ther half an hour after 12 days .
"There were two S@@ un@@ days in between . But of course , S@@ un@@ days are ch@@ ur@@ ch days , so you don &apos;t play on S@@ un@@ days . And one day it ra@@ ined , so they all s@@ at around making friends with each other ."
But there is a reason why Indi@@ a fe@@ ll in love with cri@@ ck@@ et : because we had about the same p@@ ace of life .
"( Laughter ) The Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ har@@ ata was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?"
"You f@@ ou@@ ght by day , then it was su@@ n@@ set , so everyone went back home ."
"And then you worked out your strate@@ gy , and you came and f@@ ou@@ ght the next day , and you went back home again ."
"The only difference between the Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ har@@ ata and our cri@@ ck@@ et was that in cri@@ ck@@ et , everybody was ali@@ ve to come back and fi@@ ght the next day ."
"P@@ r@@ in@@ ces pat@@ ro@@ ni@@ ze the g@@ ame , not because they love the g@@ ame , but because it was a means of ing@@ r@@ ati@@ ating themselves to the Bri@@ ti@@ sh ru@@ l@@ ers ."
"But there is one other reason why Indi@@ a fe@@ ll in love with cri@@ ck@@ et , which was , all you needed was a plan@@ k of wood and a ru@@ b@@ ber ball , and any number of people could play it any@@ where ."
"T@@ ake a look : You could play it in the du@@ m@@ p with some ro@@ cks over there , you could play it in a little al@@ ley — you couldn &apos;t h@@ it squ@@ are any@@ where , because the b@@ at h@@ it the w@@ all ; don &apos;t for@@ get the air con@@ di@@ tion@@ ing and the c@@ able wi@@ res ."
( Laughter ) You could play it on the ban@@ ks of the G@@ ang@@ es — that &apos;s as cle@@ an as the G@@ ang@@ es has been for a long time .
"O@@ r you could play many g@@ am@@ es in one small pat@@ ch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which g@@ ame you were actually in ."
"( Laughter ) A@@ s you can see , you can play any@@ where ."
"But s@@ low@@ ly the g@@ ame mo@@ ved on , you know , finally ."
"You don &apos;t always have five days . So , we mo@@ ved on , and we started playing 5@@ 0-@@ over cri@@ ck@@ et ."
And then an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous ac@@ ci@@ dent took place .
"In Indi@@ an spor@@ t we don &apos;t make things happen , ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes ."
And we won this World C@@ up in 19@@ 8@@ 3 .
"And sud@@ den@@ ly we fe@@ ll in love with the 5@@ 0-@@ over g@@ ame , and we pla@@ yed it vi@@ r@@ tually every day ."
There was more 5@@ 0-@@ over cri@@ ck@@ et than any@@ where .
But there was another big d@@ ate .
19@@ 8@@ 3 was when we won the World C@@ up .
"@@ 199@@ 1 , &apos; 9@@ 2 , we found a fin@@ ance min@@ ist@@ er and a pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er wil@@ ling to let the world look at Indi@@ a , rather than be this great country of in@@ tri@@ gu@@ e and m@@ yst@@ ery in this clo@@ sed country ."
And so we allow@@ ed mul@@ t@@ in@@ ati@@ on@@ als into Indi@@ a .
"We cut cu@@ st@@ oms du@@ ties , we redu@@ ced im@@ port du@@ ties , and we got all the mul@@ t@@ in@@ ati@@ on@@ als coming in , with mul@@ t@@ in@@ ational bud@@ gets , who looked at per@@ -@@ ca@@ pi@@ ta in@@ come and got very exci@@ ted about the possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies in Indi@@ a , and were looking for a ve@@ hi@@ cle to re@@ ach every Indi@@ an ."
"And there are only two ve@@ hi@@ cles in Indi@@ a — one real , one sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ted ."
"The sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ted one is what you see in the mov@@ ies , the real one was cri@@ ck@@ et ."
"And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , R@@ av@@ i D@@ h@@ ari@@ wa@@ l from Pe@@ p@@ si , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world ."
"And Pe@@ p@@ si was this big re@@ v@@ olution , because they started taking cri@@ ck@@ et all over ."
And so cri@@ ck@@ et started be@@ coming big ; cri@@ ck@@ et started br@@ ing@@ ing ri@@ ch@@ es in .
"T@@ ele@@ vision started co@@ ver@@ ing cri@@ ck@@ et . F@@ or a long time tele@@ vision said , &quot; &quot; We won &apos;t co@@ ver cri@@ ck@@ et un@@ less you pay us to co@@ ver it . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en they said , &quot; &quot; OK , the next ri@@ ghts are s@@ old for 5@@ 5 million dollars ."
"The next ri@@ ghts are s@@ old for 6@@ 12 million dollars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a cur@@ ve , that ."
And then another big ac@@ ci@@ dent happened in our cri@@ ck@@ et .
"E@@ n@@ gl@@ and inv@@ en@@ ted 20 over@@ s cri@@ ck@@ et , and said , &quot; &quot; The world must play 20 over@@ s cri@@ ck@@ et . &quot; &quot; J@@ ust as En@@ gl@@ and inv@@ en@@ ted cri@@ ck@@ et , and made the rest of the world play it ."
Thank God for them .
"( Laughter ) And so , Indi@@ a had to go and play the T@@ 20 World C@@ up , you see ."
Indi@@ a didn &apos;t want to play the T@@ 20 World C@@ up .
But we were for@@ ced to play it by an 8@@ -@@ 1 mar@@ g@@ in .
And then something very dra@@ m@@ atic happened .
"We got to the fin@@ al , and then this moment , that will re@@ ma@@ in en@@ sh@@ r@@ ined fore@@ ver , for everybody , take a look ."
( C@@ row@@ d che@@ ering ) The P@@ ak@@ i@@ stan@@ i bat@@ s@@ man trying to clear the fie@@ l@@ der .
An@@ n@@ oun@@ cer : And Z@@ i@@ sh@@ an takes it ! Indi@@ a win@@ s !
What a mat@@ ch for a T@@ wen@@ ty@@ 20 fin@@ al .
"In@@ di@@ a , the world ch@@ am@@ pi@@ ons ."
"( Ch@@ e@@ ering ) Indi@@ a , T@@ 20 ch@@ am@@ pi@@ ons ."
"But what a g@@ ame we had , M@@ . S. D@@ h@@ oni got it right in the air , but M@@ is@@ ba@@ h@@ -@@ ul@@ -@@ Ha@@ q , what a pla@@ y@@ er ."
"A mas@@ sive , mas@@ sive suc@@ cess : Indi@@ a , the world T@@ T ch@@ am@@ pi@@ ons ."
H@@ ar@@ sh@@ a B@@ h@@ og@@ le : S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly Indi@@ a disco@@ vered this power of 20@@ -@@ over@@ s cri@@ ck@@ et .
"The ac@@ ci@@ dent , of course , there , was that the bat@@ s@@ man thought the bow@@ ler was bow@@ ling f@@ ast ."
"( Laughter ) If he had bow@@ led f@@ ast , the ball would have gone where it was me@@ ant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we sud@@ den@@ ly disco@@ vered that we could be good at this g@@ ame ."
And what it also did was it led to a certain pri@@ de in the fact that Indi@@ a could be the best in the world .
"It was at a time when inv@@ est@@ ment was coming in , Indi@@ a was feeling a little more con@@ fi@@ dent about itself ."
And so there was a feeling that there was great pri@@ de in what we can do .
"And th@@ an@@ k@@ fully for all of us , the En@@ g@@ li@@ sh are very good at inv@@ ent@@ ing things , and then the g@@ rac@@ i@@ ous people that they are , they let the world become very good at it ."
"( Laughter ) And so En@@ gl@@ and inv@@ en@@ ted T@@ 20 cri@@ ck@@ et , and allow@@ ed Indi@@ a to hi@@ j@@ ack it ."
"It was not like re@@ engine@@ ering that we do in medi@@ cine , we just took it stra@@ ight away , as is ."
"( Laughter ) And so , we la@@ un@@ ched our own T@@ 20 le@@ ag@@ ue ."
"S@@ i@@ x weeks , city ver@@ su@@ s city ."
"It was a new thing for us . We had only ever sup@@ por@@ ted our country — the only two are@@ as in which Indi@@ a was very pro@@ u@@ d about their country , re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing itself on the fie@@ ld ."
"One was war , the Indi@@ an ar@@ my , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often ."
The other was Indi@@ an cri@@ ck@@ et .
"Now , sud@@ den@@ ly we had to sup@@ port city le@@ ag@@ u@@ es ."
But the people getting into these city le@@ ag@@ u@@ es were people who were taking their cu@@ es from the W@@ est .
"A@@ m@@ eri@@ ca is a home of le@@ ag@@ u@@ es . And they said , &quot; R@@ ight , we &apos;ll build some g@@ lit@@ zy le@@ ag@@ u@@ es here in Indi@@ a . &quot;"
But was Indi@@ a ready for it ?
"Because cri@@ ck@@ et , for a long time in Indi@@ a was always organiz@@ ed ."
"It was never pro@@ mot@@ ed , it was never s@@ old — it was organiz@@ ed ."
"And look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family g@@ ame ."
"A@@ ll of a sud@@ den , you had that happening ."
( Music ) A@@ n open@@ ing cer@@ em@@ ony to mat@@ ch every other .
This was an Indi@@ a that was bu@@ ying C@@ or@@ ve@@ t@@ tes . This was an Indi@@ a that was bu@@ ying J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar .
This was an Indi@@ a that was ad@@ ding more mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones per mon@@ th than New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and &apos;s popul@@ ation t@@ wi@@ ce over .
"So , it was a different Indi@@ a ."
"But it was also a sli@@ gh@@ tly more or@@ th@@ od@@ o@@ x Indi@@ a that was very happy to be moder@@ n , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people ."
"And so , they were ag@@ ha@@ st when the che@@ er@@ le@@ ad@@ ers ar@@ ri@@ ved ."
"E@@ very@@ one se@@ cre@@ tly wat@@ ched them , but everyone c@@ la@@ im@@ ed not to ."
( Music ) ( Laughter ) The new ow@@ n@@ ers of Indi@@ an cri@@ ck@@ et were not the old prin@@ ces .
They were not bu@@ re@@ au@@ c@@ rat@@ s who were for@@ ced into spor@@ t because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who ran seri@@ ous comp@@ an@@ ies .
"And so they started pro@@ mot@@ ing cri@@ ck@@ et big time , started pro@@ mot@@ ing clu@@ b@@ s big time ."
And they &apos;ve started pro@@ mot@@ ing them with huge money behind it .
"I mean the I@@ P@@ L had 2@@ .@@ 3 billion dollars before a ball was bow@@ led , 1@@ .@@ 6 billion dollars for tele@@ vision re@@ ven@@ ue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars p@@ lu@@ s from all these f@@ ran@@ ch@@ is@@ es that were pu@@ tting in money . And then they had to ap@@ pe@@ al to their cities , but they had to do it like the W@@ est , right ? Because we are se@@ tting up le@@ ag@@ u@@ es ."
But what they were very good at doing was making it very lo@@ c@@ aliz@@ ed .
"So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not M@@ an@@ ch@@ est@@ er United sty@@ le pro@@ moti@@ on , but very M@@ um@@ ba@@ i sty@@ le pro@@ moti@@ on . T@@ ake a look ."
"( Music ) O@@ f course , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ybe they dance better than they play . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cri@@ ck@@ et ."
"A@@ ll along , if you wanted a young cri@@ c@@ ke@@ ter , you pi@@ cked him up from the by@@ lan@@ es of your own little lo@@ c@@ ality , your own city , and you were very pro@@ u@@ d of the system that produ@@ ced those cri@@ c@@ ke@@ ters ."
"Now , all of the sud@@ den , if you were to bow@@ l a sh@@ ot — if M@@ um@@ ba@@ i were to bow@@ l a sh@@ ot , for example , they need@@ n &apos;t go to K@@ al@@ ba@@ de@@ v@@ i or S@@ hi@@ v@@ aj@@ i Par@@ k or some@@ where to source them , they could go to T@@ r@@ ini@@ d@@ ad ."
"This was the new Indi@@ a , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can source from any@@ where as long as you get the best produ@@ ct at the best pri@@ ce ."
"And all of a sud@@ den , Indi@@ an spor@@ t had a@@ wa@@ k@@ en@@ ed to the re@@ ality that you can source the best produ@@ ct for the best pri@@ ce any@@ where in the world ."
"So , the M@@ um@@ ba@@ i Indi@@ ans f@@ le@@ w in D@@ wa@@ y@@ ne Bra@@ v@@ o from T@@ r@@ ini@@ d@@ ad and T@@ ob@@ a@@ go , over@@ night . And when he had to go back to re@@ present the W@@ est In@@ d@@ ies , they asked him , &quot; &quot; When do you have to re@@ ach ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I have to be there by a certain time , so I have to leave today . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . It &apos;s not about when you have to leave ; it &apos;s about when do you have to re@@ ach there ? &quot; &quot; And so he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to re@@ ach on d@@ ate X@@ . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine , you play to d@@ ate X , min@@ us one . &quot; &quot; So , he pla@@ yed in H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , went , stra@@ ight after the g@@ ame ,"
"@@ went from the st@@ ad@@ i@@ um to H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad air@@ port , s@@ at in a pri@@ v@@ ate cor@@ por@@ ate je@@ t — first re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing in P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al , second re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing in B@@ raz@@ il ; he was in W@@ est In@@ d@@ ies in time ."
( Laughter ) N@@ ever would Indi@@ a have thought on this scale before .
"N@@ ever would Indi@@ a have said , &quot; &quot; I want a pla@@ y@@ er to play one g@@ ame for me , and I will use a cor@@ por@@ ate je@@ t to sen@@ d him all the way back to K@@ ing@@ st@@ on , J@@ am@@ a@@ i@@ ca to play a g@@ ame . &quot; &quot; And I just thought to myself , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , we &apos;ve ar@@ ri@@ ved some@@ where in the world , you know ?"
"We have ar@@ ri@@ ved some@@ where . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started mar@@ ry@@ ing the two most important things in Indi@@ an cri@@ ck@@ et , which is cri@@ ck@@ et and the mov@@ ies in Indi@@ an en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment ."
There is cri@@ ck@@ et and the mov@@ ies .
And they came together because people in the mov@@ ies now started ow@@ ning clu@@ b@@ s .
"And so , people started going to the cri@@ ck@@ et to wat@@ ch P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta ."
They started going to the cri@@ ck@@ et to wat@@ ch S@@ ha@@ h R@@ u@@ k@@ h K@@ h@@ an .
And something very interesting happened .
We started getting s@@ ong and dance in Indi@@ an cri@@ ck@@ et .
And so it started re@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ling the Indi@@ an mov@@ ies more and more .
"And of course , if you were on P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta &apos;s team — as you will see on the cli@@ p that fol@@ low@@ s — if you did well , you got a hu@@ g from P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta ."
So that was the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate reason to do well . T@@ ake a look — everyone &apos;s wat@@ ching P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta .
( Music ) And then of course there was S@@ ha@@ h R@@ u@@ k@@ h playing the K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata c@@ row@@ d .
"We &apos;d all seen mat@@ ch@@ es in K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : S@@ ha@@ h R@@ u@@ k@@ h , with the B@@ eng@@ ali s@@ ong , getting the aud@@ ien@@ ces all worked up for K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata — not for Indi@@ a , but for K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata ."
But take a look at this .
( Music ) A@@ n Indi@@ an film st@@ ar hu@@ gg@@ ing a P@@ ak@@ i@@ stan@@ i cri@@ c@@ ke@@ ter because they &apos;d won in K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata .
C@@ an you imagine ?
And do you know what the P@@ ak@@ i@@ stan@@ i cri@@ c@@ ke@@ ter said ?
( Applause ) &quot; I wi@@ sh I was playing for P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta &apos;s team . &quot;
( Laughter ) But I thought I &apos;d take this opportunity — there &apos;s a few people from P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an in here .
"I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?"
"We can play cri@@ ck@@ et together , we can be friends ."
"So th@@ ank you very much for coming , all of you from P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an ."
"( Applause ) There was cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ sm too because they said , &quot; &quot; P@@ la@@ y@@ ers are being b@@ ou@@ ght and s@@ old ?"
A@@ re they gra@@ in ?
"A@@ re they cat@@ tle ? &quot; &quot; Because we had this au@@ ction , you see ."
How do you fi@@ x a pri@@ ce for a pla@@ y@@ er ?
"And so the au@@ ction that fol@@ low@@ ed liter@@ ally had people saying , &quot; B@@ an@@ g ! so many million dollars for so@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ so pla@@ y@@ er . &quot;"
There it is .
"( Music ) Au@@ cti@@ one@@ er : Go@@ ing at 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars . Ch@@ en@@ na@@ i ."
"S@@ h@@ ane W@@ ar@@ ne s@@ old for 4@@ 5@@ 0,000 dollars ."
"H@@ B : S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly , a g@@ ame which ear@@ ned its pla@@ y@@ ers 50 ru@@ pe@@ es a day — so 2@@ 50 ru@@ pe@@ es for a test mat@@ ch , but if you fin@@ is@@ h in four days you only got 2@@ 00 ."
"The best Indi@@ an pla@@ y@@ ers who pla@@ yed every test mat@@ ch — every one of the inter@@ n@@ ati@@ on@@ als , the top of the line pla@@ y@@ ers — stan@@ d@@ ard con@@ trac@@ ts are 2@@ 20@@ ,000 dollars in a whole year ."
"Now they were getting 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 for six days &apos; work ."
"Th@@ en An@@ dre@@ w F@@ lin@@ to@@ ff came by from En@@ gl@@ and , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or four weeks , I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than Fran@@ k L@@ am@@ par@@ d and Ste@@ ven G@@ er@@ r@@ ard , and I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than the fo@@ ot@@ bal@@ l@@ ers , wo@@ w . &quot; &quot; And where was he ear@@ ning it from ? F@@ ro@@ m a little c@@ lub in Indi@@ a ."
C@@ ould you have imag@@ ined that day would come ?
One and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
"That &apos;s not bad , is it ?"
"So , at 2@@ .@@ 3 billion dollars before the first ball was bow@@ led ."
"What Indi@@ a was doing , though , was b@@ en@@ ch@@ mar@@ king itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge br@@ and ."
L@@ al@@ it M@@ od@@ i was on the co@@ ver of B@@ us@@ iness T@@ od@@ ay .
"I@@ P@@ L became the bi@@ ggest br@@ and in Indi@@ a and , because our ele@@ ctions , had to be mo@@ ved to S@@ outh Africa , and we had to start the t@@ our@@ na@@ ment in three weeks ."
Mo@@ ve a whole t@@ our@@ na@@ ment to S@@ outh Africa in three weeks .
But we did it . You know why ?
"Because no country works as s@@ low@@ ly as we do ti@@ ll three weeks before an ev@@ ent , and no@@ body works f@@ ast as we do in the last three weeks ."
"( Applause ) O@@ ur popul@@ ation , which for a long time we thought was a problem , sud@@ den@@ ly became our bi@@ ggest as@@ set because there were more people wat@@ ching — the huge con@@ sum@@ ing clas@@ s — everybody came to wat@@ ch the cri@@ ck@@ et ."
"We &apos;d also made cri@@ ck@@ et the only spor@@ t in Indi@@ a , which is a pi@@ ty , but in Indi@@ a every other spor@@ t p@@ us@@ h@@ es cri@@ ck@@ et to become big , which is a bit of a tra@@ ge@@ dy of our times ."
"Now , this last minu@@ te before I go — there &apos;s a couple of side effe@@ cts of all this ."
"For a long time , Indi@@ a was this country of po@@ ver@@ ty , d@@ ust , be@@ gg@@ ars , s@@ na@@ ke char@@ m@@ ers , fil@@ th , D@@ el@@ h@@ i be@@ lly — people heard D@@ el@@ h@@ i be@@ lly stories before they came ."
"And , all of a sud@@ den , Indi@@ a was this land of opportunity ."
"C@@ ri@@ c@@ ke@@ ters all over the world said , &quot; You know , we love Indi@@ a . We love to play in Indi@@ a . &quot;"
"And that felt good , you know ?"
"We said , &quot; &quot; The dol@@ lar &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot; &quot; C@@ an you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dol@@ lar on view and there &apos;s no D@@ el@@ h@@ i be@@ lly in there any@@ more ."
"There &apos;s no fil@@ th , there &apos;s no be@@ gg@@ ars , all the s@@ na@@ ke char@@ m@@ ers have v@@ ani@@ shed , everybody &apos;s gone . This tel@@ ls you how the ca@@ pit@@ ali@@ st world ru@@ les ."
"R@@ ight so , finally , an En@@ g@@ li@@ sh g@@ ame that Indi@@ a us@@ ur@@ ped a little bit , but T@@ 20 is going to be the next mis@@ si@@ on@@ ary in the world ."
"If you want to take the g@@ ame around the world , it &apos;s got to be the shor@@ test form of the g@@ ame ."
"You can &apos;t take a ti@@ me@@ less test to China and si@@ t through 14 days with no resul@@ t in the end , or you can &apos;t take it all over the world ."
So that &apos;s what T@@ 20 is doing .
"H@@ op@@ e@@ fully , it &apos;ll make everyone ri@@ ch@@ er , hop@@ e@@ fully it &apos;ll make the g@@ ame bi@@ g@@ ger and hop@@ e@@ fully it &apos;ll give cri@@ ck@@ et com@@ ment@@ at@@ ors more time in the business ."
Thank you very much . Thank you .

"And th@@ an@@ ks to the people of Inter@@ face , I have become a re@@ co@@ ver@@ ing p@@ lu@@ n@@ der@@ er ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a F@@ or@@ tu@@ ne M@@ ag@@ az@@ ine wri@@ ter that some@@ day people like me would go to ja@@ il .
And that became the he@@ ad@@ line of a F@@ or@@ tu@@ ne arti@@ cle .
They went on to descri@@ be me as America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O .
"F@@ ro@@ m p@@ lu@@ n@@ der@@ er to re@@ co@@ ver@@ ing p@@ lu@@ n@@ der@@ er , to America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O in five years — that , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , was a pretty sa@@ d com@@ ment@@ ary on American C@@ E@@ O@@ s in 199@@ 9 ."
"A@@ sk@@ ed later in the C@@ an@@ ad@@ i@@ an do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ary , &quot; &quot; The C@@ or@@ por@@ ation , &quot; &quot; what I me@@ ant by the &quot; &quot; go to ja@@ il &quot; &quot; re@@ mar@@ k , I of@@ fer@@ ed that the@@ ft is a cri@@ me ."
And the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future would some@@ day be a cri@@ me .
"But I realized , for that to be true — for the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future to be a cri@@ me — there must be a clear , de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ble alter@@ n@@ ative to the tak@@ e-@@ mak@@ e-@@ wa@@ ste indu@@ stri@@ al system that so dom@@ in@@ ates our ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , and is the major cul@@ pr@@ it , ste@@ al@@ ing our children &apos;s future , by di@@ gg@@ ing up the ear@@ th and con@@ ver@@ ting it to produ@@ cts that quickly become wa@@ ste in a land@@ fi@@ ll or an in@@ cin@@ er@@ ator — in shor@@ t , di@@ gg@@ ing up the ear@@ th and con@@ ver@@ ting it to pol@@ lu@@ tion ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch and a wel@@ l-@@ known environ@@ ment@@ al impac@@ t equ@@ ation , impac@@ t — a bad thing — is the produ@@ ct of popul@@ ation , af@@ flu@@ ence and technology ."
"That is , impac@@ t is gener@@ ated by people , what they con@@ su@@ me in their af@@ flu@@ ence , and how it is produ@@ ced ."
"And though the equ@@ ation is lar@@ ge@@ ly sub@@ je@@ ctive , you can per@@ haps qu@@ anti@@ fy people , and per@@ haps qu@@ anti@@ fy af@@ flu@@ ence , but technology is ab@@ u@@ sive in too many ways to qu@@ anti@@ fy ."
So the equ@@ ation is con@@ cep@@ tu@@ al .
S@@ ti@@ ll it works to help us understand the problem .
"So we set out at Inter@@ face , in 199@@ 4 , to create an example : to trans@@ form the way we made car@@ pe@@ t , a pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um@@ -@@ inten@@ sive produ@@ ct for materi@@ als as well as energy , and to trans@@ form our technolog@@ ies so they di@@ min@@ i@@ shed environ@@ ment@@ al impac@@ t , rather than mul@@ ti@@ pl@@ ied it ."
"P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch &apos;s environ@@ ment@@ al impac@@ t equ@@ ation : I is equ@@ al to P times A times T : popul@@ ation , af@@ flu@@ ence and technology ."
I wanted Inter@@ face to re@@ write that equ@@ ation so that it read I equ@@ als P times A di@@ vi@@ ded by T@@ .
"Now , the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal@@ ly@@ -@@ min@@ ded will see im@@ medi@@ ately that T in the num@@ er@@ ator incre@@ ases impac@@ t — a bad thing — but T in the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator de@@ cre@@ ases impac@@ t ."
"So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the num@@ er@@ ator — call it T@@ 1 — where it incre@@ ases impac@@ t , to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator — call it T@@ 2 — where it redu@@ ces impac@@ t ?"
"I thought about the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ sti@@ cs of first indu@@ stri@@ al re@@ v@@ olution , T@@ 1 , as we prac@@ ti@@ ced it at Inter@@ face , and it had the fol@@ low@@ ing char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ sti@@ cs ."

We call it Co@@ ol C@@ ar@@ pe@@ t .
"And it has been a powerful marke@@ t@@ place differ@@ enti@@ ator , incre@@ as@@ ing s@@ al@@ es and pro@@ fi@@ ts ."
"Th@@ ree years ago we la@@ un@@ ched car@@ pe@@ t ti@@ le for the home , under the br@@ and F@@ lor , mis@@ spe@@ l@@ led F@@ -@@ L@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ R ."
You can point and cli@@ ck today at F@@ l@@ or@@ .@@ co@@ m and have Co@@ ol C@@ ar@@ pe@@ t deli@@ vered to your front door in five days .
"It is prac@@ tical , and pretty too ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We re@@ ck@@ on that we are a bit over hal@@ f@@ way to our go@@ al : zer@@ o impac@@ t , zer@@ o fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int ."
"We &apos;ve set 20@@ 20 as our tar@@ get year for zer@@ o , for re@@ ach@@ ing the top , the sum@@ m@@ it of M@@ oun@@ t Su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability ."
We call this M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o .
And this is per@@ haps the most important fac@@ et : we have found M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o to be incredi@@ bly good for business .
"A better business model , a better way to bi@@ g@@ ger pro@@ fi@@ ts ."
Here is the business case for susta@@ in@@ ability .
"F@@ ro@@ m real life experience , co@@ sts are down , not up , ref@@ le@@ cting some 4@@ 00 million dollars of av@@ o@@ i@@ ded co@@ sts in pur@@ su@@ it of zer@@ o wa@@ ste — the first face of M@@ oun@@ t Su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability ."
This has pa@@ id all the co@@ sts for the trans@@ form@@ ation of Inter@@ face .
"And this di@@ spe@@ ls a my@@ th too , this fal@@ se cho@@ ice between the environment and the econom@@ y ."
"O@@ ur produ@@ cts are the best they &apos;ve ever been , inspi@@ red by design for susta@@ in@@ ability , an u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted wel@@ l@@ sp@@ ring of in@@ no@@ vation ."
O@@ ur people are gal@@ v@@ ani@@ zed around this sh@@ ared high@@ er pur@@ pos@@ e .
You cannot be@@ at it for at@@ trac@@ ting the best people and br@@ ing@@ ing them together .
And the go@@ od@@ will of the marke@@ t@@ place is ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing .
"No amount of ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing , no cle@@ ver marke@@ ting cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , at any pri@@ ce , could have produ@@ ced or created this much go@@ od@@ will ."
"C@@ ost@@ s , produ@@ cts , people , marke@@ t@@ places — what else is there ?"
It is a better business model .
And here is our 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year recor@@ d of s@@ al@@ es and pro@@ fi@@ ts .
"There is a di@@ p there , from 200@@ 1 to 200@@ 3 : a di@@ p when our s@@ al@@ es , over a thre@@ e-@@ year per@@ i@@ od , were down 1@@ 7 percent ."
But the marke@@ t@@ place was down 3@@ 6 percent .
We liter@@ ally ga@@ ined market share .
We might not have survi@@ ved that re@@ ces@@ sion but for the adv@@ an@@ t@@ ages of susta@@ in@@ ability .
"If every business were pur@@ su@@ ing Inter@@ face pl@@ ans , would that sol@@ ve all our problems ?"
I don &apos;t think so .
"I re@@ ma@@ in t@@ rou@@ b@@ led by the re@@ vi@@ sed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch equ@@ ation , I equ@@ als P times A di@@ vi@@ ded by T@@ 2 ."
"That A is a ca@@ pi@@ tal A , su@@ gg@@ est@@ ing that af@@ flu@@ ence is an end in itself ."
But what if we re@@ fra@@ med E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch f@@ ur@@ ther ?
"And what if we made A a low@@ er@@ case &apos; a , &apos; su@@ gg@@ est@@ ing that it is a means to an end , and that end is happ@@ iness — more happ@@ iness with less stuff ."
"You know that would re@@ fra@@ me ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of econ@@ omi@@ cs , if not for our species , then per@@ haps for the one that suc@@ ce@@ eds us : the susta@@ in@@ able species , living on a fini@@ te ear@@ th , e@@ thi@@ cally , ha@@ p@@ pi@@ ly and e@@ co@@ logi@@ cally in bal@@ ance with nature and all her natural systems for a thous@@ and gener@@ ations , or 1@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations — that is to say , into the in@@ defini@@ te future ."
But does the ear@@ th have to wa@@ it for our ex@@ t@@ in@@ ction as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
"A@@ t Inter@@ face we really inten@@ d to bring this pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pi@@ cal susta@@ in@@ able , zer@@ o@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int indu@@ stri@@ al company fully into ex@@ ist@@ ence by 20@@ 20 ."
"We can see our way now , clear to the top of that m@@ oun@@ tain ."
And now the challen@@ ge is in ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tion .
"And as my good friend and ad@@ vi@@ s@@ er A@@ mor@@ y L@@ o@@ v@@ ins says , &quot; If something ex@@ ist@@ s , it must be possible . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible ."
"If we , a pe@@ tro@@ -@@ inten@@ sive company can do it , any@@ body can ."
"And if any@@ body can , it fol@@ low@@ s that everybody can ."
"H@@ aw@@ k@@ en fu@@ l@@ fil@@ led business and indu@@ stry , le@@ ading hum@@ an@@ kind away from the ab@@ y@@ ss because , with contin@@ u@@ ed un@@ che@@ cked dec@@ line of the bio@@ sp@@ here , a very de@@ ar person is at ri@@ sk here — f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , an un@@ ac@@ cep@@ table ri@@ sk ."
Wh@@ o is that person ?
N@@ ot you . N@@ ot I@@ .
But let me in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to the one who is most at ri@@ sk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this m@@ oun@@ tain clim@@ b .
"O@@ n a T@@ u@@ es@@ day morning in Mar@@ ch of 199@@ 6 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , br@@ ing@@ ing them along and often not know@@ ing whether I was conne@@ cting ."
"But about five days later back in At@@ lan@@ ta , I re@@ cei@@ ved an e@@ ma@@ il from G@@ len@@ n Th@@ om@@ as , one of my people in the C@@ alifor@@ nia me@@ e@@ ting ."
He was sen@@ ding me an ori@@ gin@@ al po@@ em that he had com@@ posed after our T@@ u@@ es@@ day morning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most up@@ li@@ f@@ ting mom@@ ents of my life .
"Because it told me , by God , one person got it ."
"H@@ ere is what G@@ len@@ n wro@@ te . And here is that person , most at ri@@ sk ."
"P@@ le@@ ase me@@ et &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s Chi@@ ld . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ th@@ out a name , an un@@ seen face , and know@@ ing not your time or place , T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , though yet un@@ born , I met you first last T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ n ."
A wi@@ se friend in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced us two .
"And through his sob@@ ering point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me ."
K@@ now@@ ing you has changed my thinking .
"For I never had an in@@ k@@ ling that per@@ haps the things I do might some@@ day , some@@ how thre@@ at@@ en you ."
"T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , my d@@ aughter , son , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;ve just be@@ gu@@ n to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should ."
"Be@@ g@@ in , I will ."
"The way the cost of what I squ@@ an@@ der , what is lost , if ever I for@@ get that you will some@@ day come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s Chi@@ ld &quot; &quot; has spo@@ k@@ en to me with one simple but pro@@ found mess@@ age , which I pre@@ su@@ me to share with you ."
"We are , each and every one , a part of the we@@ b of life ."
"The contin@@ u@@ um of hum@@ ani@@ ty , sure , but in a lar@@ ger sense , the we@@ b of life itself ."
"And we have a cho@@ ice to make during our br@@ ie@@ f , br@@ ie@@ f visi@@ t to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to h@@ ur@@ t it or to help it ."
"For you , it &apos;s your call ."
Thank you .
