"B@@ y the end of this year , there &apos;ll be ne@@ ar@@ ly a billion people on this planet that acti@@ vely use social net@@ working si@@ tes ."
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
"W@@ hi@@ le that might be a some@@ what mor@@ bi@@ d thought , I think it has some really pro@@ found im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations that are wor@@ th expl@@ or@@ ing ."
"What first got me thinking about this was a blo@@ g pos@@ t au@@ th@@ o@@ red ear@@ lie@@ r this year by D@@ er@@ ek K@@ . M@@ il@@ ler , who was a science and technology jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st who d@@ ied of can@@ cer ."
And what M@@ il@@ ler did was have his family and friends write a pos@@ t that went out shor@@ tly after he d@@ ied .
Here &apos;s what he wro@@ te in star@@ ting that out .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m de@@ ad , and this is my last pos@@ t to my blo@@ g ."
"In adv@@ ance , I asked that once my body finally sh@@ u@@ t down from the pu@@ ni@@ sh@@ ments of my can@@ cer , then my family and friends publi@@ sh this pre@@ par@@ ed mess@@ age I wro@@ te — the first part of the process of tur@@ ning this from an ac@@ tive we@@ b@@ site to an archi@@ ve . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st , M@@ il@@ ler &apos;s archi@@ ve may have been better wri@@ t@@ ten and more car@@ e@@ fully cur@@ ated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are cre@@ ating an archi@@ ve that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any pre@@ vi@@ ous gener@@ ation ."
Con@@ si@@ der a few stat@@ s for a moment .
R@@ ight now there are 4@@ 8 hours of video being up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed to Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be every single minu@@ te .
There are 2@@ 00 million T@@ wee@@ ts being post@@ ed every day .
And the a@@ ver@@ age F@@ ace@@ book us@@ er is cre@@ ating 90 pie@@ ces of cont@@ ent each mon@@ th .
"So when you think about your parents or your grand@@ parents , at best they may have created some ph@@ ot@@ os or home vi@@ de@@ os , or a di@@ ary that lives in a box some@@ where ."
"But today we &apos;re all cre@@ ating this incredi@@ bly ri@@ ch di@@ gi@@ tal archi@@ ve that &apos;s going to live in the cl@@ ou@@ d in@@ defini@@ tely , years after we &apos;re gone ."
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredi@@ bly in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing opportuni@@ ties for technologi@@ sts .
"Now to be clear , I &apos;m a jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st and not a technologi@@ st , so what I &apos;d like to do br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly is pa@@ int a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like ."
Now we &apos;re already seeing some ser@@ vi@@ ces that are desig@@ ned to let us deci@@ de what happens to our on@@ line pro@@ fi@@ le and our social media ac@@ coun@@ ts after we die .
"One of them actually , fi@@ t@@ t@@ ing@@ ly enough , found me when I che@@ cked into a de@@ li at a re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant in New York on f@@ our@@ squ@@ are ."
( Re@@ cor@@ ding ) A@@ d@@ am O@@ stro@@ w : H@@ el@@ l@@ o .
De@@ ath : A@@ d@@ am ?
A@@ O : Yeah .
"D@@ e@@ ath : De@@ ath can cat@@ ch you any@@ where , any@@ time , even at the O@@ r@@ gani@@ c ."
A@@ O : Wh@@ o is this ?
De@@ ath : G@@ o to i@@ fi@@ d@@ ie@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too l@@ ate .
"( Laughter ) A@@ d@@ am O@@ stro@@ w : K@@ ind of cre@@ e@@ py , right ?"
"So what that ser@@ vice does , quite simply , is let you create a mess@@ age or a video that can be post@@ ed to F@@ ace@@ book after you die ."
"A@@ no@@ ther ser@@ vice right now is called 1@@ ,000 Me@@ mor@@ ies ."
"And what this le@@ ts you do is create an on@@ line tri@@ bu@@ te to your lo@@ ved ones , comple@@ te with ph@@ ot@@ os and vi@@ de@@ os and stories that they can pos@@ t after you die ."
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
"Now a lot of you are probably fami@@ li@@ ar with De@@ b Ro@@ y who , back in Mar@@ ch , de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated how he was able to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze more than 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video ."
"I think as mach@@ ines &apos; ability to understand human language and process v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of data contin@@ u@@ es to impro@@ ve , it &apos;s going to become possible to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze an entire life &apos;s wor@@ th of cont@@ ent — the T@@ wee@@ ts , the ph@@ ot@@ os , the vi@@ de@@ os , the blo@@ g po@@ sts — that we &apos;re produ@@ cing in such mas@@ sive num@@ bers ."
"And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our di@@ gi@@ tal per@@ son@@ as to contin@@ ue to inter@@ act in the real world long after we &apos;re gone th@@ an@@ ks to the v@@ ast@@ ness of the amount of cont@@ ent we &apos;re cre@@ ating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all ."
Now we &apos;re already star@@ ting to see some experim@@ ents here .
"One ser@@ vice called My N@@ ex@@ t T@@ we@@ et an@@ al@@ yz@@ es your entire T@@ wit@@ ter stre@@ am , everything you &apos;ve post@@ ed on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , to make some pre@@ di@@ ctions as to what you might say next ."
"Well right now , as you can see , the resul@@ ts can be some@@ what com@@ i@@ cal ."
"You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our techni@@ cal cap@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies impro@@ ve ."
"T@@ aking it a ste@@ p f@@ ur@@ ther , M@@ I@@ T &apos;s media la@@ b is working on rob@@ ots that can inter@@ act more like hum@@ ans ."
But what if those rob@@ ots were able to inter@@ act based on the uni@@ qu@@ e char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ sti@@ cs of a speci@@ fic person based on the hundre@@ ds of thousands of pie@@ ces of cont@@ ent that person produ@@ ces in their li@@ fe@@ time ?
"F@@ in@@ ally , think back to this fam@@ ous scen@@ e from ele@@ ction night 200@@ 8 back in the United States , where C@@ N@@ N be@@ am@@ ed a live ho@@ lo@@ gra@@ m of hi@@ p ho@@ p arti@@ st wil@@ l@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ am into their studi@@ o for an inter@@ view with An@@ der@@ son Co@@ op@@ er ."
What if we were able to use that same ty@@ pe of technology to be@@ am a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of our lo@@ ved ones into our living ro@@ oms — inter@@ ac@@ ting in a very li@@ fe@@ like way based on all the cont@@ ent they created while they were ali@@ ve ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re produ@@ cing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both ex@@ p@@ and ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally .
"Now in clo@@ sing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our re@@ ality — and if so , what it means for a defini@@ tion of life and everything that comes after it ."
Thank you very much .

The second quot@@ e is from the head of the U@@ K F@@ in@@ an@@ cial S@@ er@@ vi@@ ces Au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , the answer is y@@ es ."
"Th@@ en , pre@@ di@@ ctions can be made and test@@ ed ."
So what do we know about comple@@ x systems ?
So the whole is liter@@ ally more than the su@@ m of its par@@ ts .
W@@ here are economic net@@ works ?
What we looked at in de@@ ta@@ il was ow@@ ner@@ ship net@@ works .
And we also as@@ sig@@ n a val@@ ue to the company given by the oper@@ ating re@@ ven@@ ue .
How are they organiz@@ ed ? A@@ re they is@@ ol@@ ated ?
"These are comp@@ an@@ ies that oper@@ ate in more than one country , and we found 4@@ 3@@ ,000 ."
Let me expla@@ in by gi@@ ving you this an@@ al@@ og@@ y .
"H@@ i . T@@ od@@ ay , I &apos;m going to take you through g@@ lim@@ p@@ ses of about eight of my proje@@ cts , done in col@@ labor@@ ation with D@@ ani@@ sh arti@@ st S@@ ore@@ n P@@ ors ."
"We call ourselves P@@ ors and R@@ a@@ o , and we live and work in Indi@@ a ."
"I &apos;d like to beg@@ in with my very first obje@@ ct , which I call &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was inspi@@ red by my un@@ cle &apos;s pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ha@@ bit of con@@ stan@@ tly as@@ king me to do things for him , almost like I were an ex@@ ten@@ sion of his body — to turn on the li@@ ghts or to bring him a gl@@ as@@ s of water , a p@@ ack of ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , it became wor@@ se and wor@@ se , And I started to think of it as a form of control ."
"But of course , I could never say anything , because the un@@ cle is a re@@ spe@@ cted figure in the Indi@@ an family ."
And the situ@@ ation that ir@@ ked me and m@@ yst@@ i@@ f@@ ied me the most was his use of a land@@ line tele@@ phone .
He would h@@ old on to the re@@ cei@@ ver and expe@@ ct me to di@@ al a number for him .
"And so as a respon@@ se and as a gi@@ ft to my un@@ cle , I made him &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requi@@ res two people to use it ."
It &apos;s exactly the way my un@@ cle uses a phone that &apos;s desig@@ ned for one person .
"But the problem is that , when I left home and went to colle@@ ge , I started mis@@ sing his com@@ man@@ ds ."
And so I made him a g@@ ol@@ den ty@@ pew@@ ri@@ ter through which he could disp@@ en@@ se his com@@ man@@ ds to ne@@ p@@ he@@ ws and nie@@ ces around the world as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So what he had to do was take a piece of pa@@ per , ro@@ ll it into the car@@ ri@@ age , ty@@ pe his e@@ ma@@ il or comm@@ and and pu@@ ll the pa@@ per out ."
This de@@ vice would au@@ tom@@ ati@@ cally sen@@ d the inten@@ ded person the let@@ ter as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So here you can see , we em@@ be@@ d@@ ded a lot of ele@@ c@@ tro@@ ni@@ cs that under@@ stan@@ ds all of the mechani@@ cal ac@@ tions and con@@ ver@@ ts it to di@@ gi@@ tal ."
So my un@@ cle is only de@@ al@@ ing with a mechani@@ cal inter@@ face .
"And of course , the obje@@ ct had to be very gr@@ and and have a sense of ri@@ tu@@ ali@@ sm , the way my un@@ cle li@@ k@@ es it ."
"The next work is a soun@@ d-@@ sen@@ si@@ tive in@@ stal@@ l@@ ation that we af@@ fe@@ cti@@ on@@ ately call &quot; &quot; The P@@ y@@ g@@ mie@@ s . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a noti@@ on of being sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sen@@ si@@ tive and s@@ we@@ et cre@@ at@@ ures ."
"So how it works is we have these pan@@ els , which we have on the w@@ all , and behind them , we have these little cre@@ at@@ ures which hi@@ de ."
"And as so@@ on as it &apos;s sil@@ ent , they sort of cre@@ ep out ."
"And if it &apos;s even more sil@@ ent , they stre@@ t@@ ch their ne@@ cks out ."
"And at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hi@@ de back again ."
So we had these pan@@ els on three wal@@ ls of a room .
And we had over 500 of these little py@@ g@@ mie@@ s hi@@ ding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pe .
"So when it &apos;s qu@@ ie@@ t , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the pan@@ els ."
"And they hear like hum@@ ans do , or real cre@@ at@@ ures do ."
So they get im@@ mu@@ ne to sounds that sc@@ are them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t re@@ act to back@@ ground sounds .
You &apos;ll hear a tra@@ in in moment that they don &apos;t re@@ act to .
( N@@ o@@ ise ) But they re@@ act to fore@@ ground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( W@@ hi@@ st@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as li@@ fe@@ like as possible .
"So each py@@ g@@ my has its own behavi@@ or , psy@@ ch@@ e , mo@@ od s@@ w@@ ings , per@@ son@@ ali@@ ties and so on ."
So this is a very early pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pe .
"O@@ f course , it got much better after that ."
"And we made them re@@ act to people , but we found that people were being quite pla@@ y@@ ful and chil@@ d@@ like with them ."
This is a video in@@ stal@@ l@@ ation called &quot; &quot; The M@@ is@@ sing P@@ er@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with playing with the noti@@ on of in@@ visi@@ bility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of in@@ visi@@ bility ?
"So we worked with a company that speci@@ aliz@@ es in cam@@ era sur@@ ve@@ il@@ l@@ ance , and we asked them to develo@@ p a piece of so@@ f@@ tw@@ are with us , using a cam@@ era that could look at people in the room , tr@@ ack them and re@@ place one person with the back@@ ground , ren@@ der@@ ing them in@@ visi@@ ble ."
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pe .
"O@@ n the right side you can see my colle@@ ag@@ ue S@@ ore@@ n , who &apos;s actually in the space ."
"And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the pro@@ cess@@ ed video where the cam@@ era has made him in@@ visi@@ ble ."
S@@ ore@@ n en@@ ters the room . Po@@ p ! He goes in@@ visi@@ ble .
And you can see that the cam@@ era is trac@@ king him and er@@ as@@ ing .
"It &apos;s a very early video , so we ha@@ ven &apos;t yet de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty so@@ on , later ."
"So how we used it was in a room where we had a cam@@ era looking into the space , and we had one mon@@ it@@ or , one on each w@@ all ."
"And as people wal@@ ked into the room , they would see themselves in the mon@@ it@@ or , ex@@ cept with one difference : one person was con@@ stan@@ tly in@@ visi@@ ble wh@@ er@@ ever they mo@@ ved in the room ."
"So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Su@@ n S@@ ha@@ do@@ w . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sh@@ e@@ et of pa@@ per , like a cu@@ t@@ out of a chil@@ d@@ like d@@ raw@@ ing of an oil spi@@ ll or a su@@ n ."
"And from the front , this obje@@ ct ap@@ pe@@ ared to be very stron@@ g and rob@@ ust , and from the side , it almost seem@@ ed very we@@ ak ."
"So people would wal@@ king into the room and they &apos;d almost ig@@ nor@@ e it , thinking it was some c@@ ra@@ p la@@ ying around ."
"But as so@@ on as they pas@@ sed by , it would start to clim@@ b up the w@@ all in j@@ er@@ k@@ y fas@@ hi@@ on ."
"And it would get ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ed , and it would col@@ lap@@ se every time ."
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ i@@ c@@ ature of an up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down man .
"H@@ is head is so he@@ av@@ y , full of he@@ av@@ y thou@@ ghts , that it &apos;s sort of fal@@ le@@ n into his h@@ at , and his body &apos;s grow@@ n out of him almost like a pl@@ ant ."
Well what he does is he mo@@ ves around in a very dru@@ n@@ k@@ en fas@@ hi@@ on on his head in a very un@@ pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able and extre@@ me@@ ly s@@ low movement .
And it &apos;s kind of con@@ stra@@ ined by that cir@@ cle .
"Because if that cir@@ cle wer@@ en &apos;t there , and the flo@@ or was very even , it would start to wan@@ der about in the space ."
And there &apos;s no wi@@ res .
"So I &apos;ll just show you an in@@ stance — so when people enter the room , it acti@@ v@@ ates this obje@@ ct ."
"And it very s@@ low@@ ly , over a few minutes , sort of pain@@ fully goes up , and then it ga@@ ins mom@@ entu@@ m and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to f@@ all ."
"And this is an important moment , because we wanted to in@@ still in the vie@@ wer an in@@ st@@ in@@ ct to almost go and help , or sa@@ ve the sub@@ je@@ ct ."
"But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ages to pu@@ ll itself up ."
"So this work was a real techni@@ cal challen@@ ge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechani@@ cs right and the e@@ qui@@ li@@ bri@@ um and the dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs ."
"And it was very important for us to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh the ex@@ act moment that it would f@@ all , because if we made it in a way that it would top@@ ple over , then it would dam@@ age itself , and if it didn &apos;t f@@ all enough , it wouldn &apos;t in@@ still that f@@ at@@ ali@@ sm , or that sense of wan@@ ting to go and help it ."
So I &apos;m going to show you a very qui@@ ck video where we are doing a test scen@@ ari@@ o — it &apos;s much f@@ ast@@ er .
That &apos;s my colle@@ ag@@ ue . He &apos;s let it go .
"Now he &apos;s getting ner@@ v@@ ous , so he &apos;s going to go cat@@ ch it ."
"But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ages to li@@ ft itself up on its own ."
"So this is a work that we were very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with , working with the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic of fu@@ r em@@ be@@ d@@ ded with thousands of t@@ iny different si@@ z@@ es of fi@@ ber op@@ ti@@ cs , which tw@@ in@@ k@@ le like the night sk@@ y ."
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sk@@ y .
"So we w@@ ra@@ pped this around a blo@@ b@@ -@@ like form , which is in the sha@@ pe of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which was h@@ ang@@ ing from the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
"And the idea was to sort of con@@ tra@@ st something very c@@ old and di@@ st@@ ant and ab@@ strac@@ t like the universe into the fami@@ li@@ ar form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which is very comfor@@ ting and in@@ ti@@ m@@ ate ."
"And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar and you would almost per@@ cei@@ ve it to be a ho@@ le in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling night sk@@ y ."
"So this is the last work , and a work in pro@@ gre@@ ss , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ace F@@ il@@ ler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the mi@@ ddle of the room , and as you appro@@ ach@@ ed it , it tr@@ ied to in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ate you by grow@@ ing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s t@@ wi@@ ce its he@@ ight and &#91; eight &#93; times its v@@ olu@@ me ."
And so this obje@@ ct is con@@ stan@@ tly ex@@ pan@@ ding and con@@ trac@@ ting to create a dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a se@@ cre@@ t within its se@@ am@@ s or something .
"So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gi@@ ves us a lot of pa@@ in in our work over years and years ."
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to ex@@ pre@@ ss the emoti@@ ons and behavi@@ or@@ al pat@@ ter@@ ns in these cre@@ at@@ ures that we create .
"And once a cre@@ ature po@@ ps into our min@@ ds , it &apos;s almost like the process of cre@@ ation is to disco@@ ver the way this cre@@ ature really wan@@ ts to exi@@ st and what form it wan@@ ts to take and what way it wan@@ ts to move ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I love the Inter@@ net .
It &apos;s true .
Th@@ in@@ k about everything it has brought us .
"Th@@ in@@ k about all the ser@@ vi@@ ces we use , all the conne@@ cti@@ vity , all the en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , all the business , all the comm@@ er@@ ce ."
And it &apos;s happening during our li@@ fe@@ times .
"I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history boo@@ ks hundre@@ ds of years from now . This time our gener@@ ation will be re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed as the gener@@ ation that got on@@ line , the gener@@ ation that built something really and tru@@ ly global ."
"But y@@ es , it &apos;s also true that the Inter@@ net has problems , very seri@@ ous problems , problems with secu@@ ri@@ ty and problems with pri@@ vac@@ y ."
I &apos;ve spent my car@@ e@@ er fi@@ gh@@ ting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is Bra@@ in .
This is a flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k — five and a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ ch flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k in@@ fe@@ cted by Bra@@ in@@ .@@ A@@ .
It &apos;s the first vi@@ ru@@ s we ever found for P@@ C compu@@ ters .
And we actually know where Bra@@ in came from .
We know because it says so inside the c@@ od@@ e .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
"That &apos;s the bo@@ ot se@@ ctor of an in@@ fe@@ cted flo@@ pp@@ y , and if we take a clo@@ s@@ er look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on . &quot; &quot; And then it contin@@ u@@ es , saying , 19@@ 8@@ 6 , B@@ a@@ si@@ t and Am@@ j@@ ad ."
"And B@@ a@@ si@@ t and Am@@ j@@ ad are first na@@ mes , P@@ ak@@ i@@ stan@@ i first na@@ mes ."
"In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an ad@@ dre@@ ss in P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) Now , 19@@ 8@@ 6 ."
Now it &apos;s 20@@ 11 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The P@@ C vi@@ ru@@ s problem is 25 years old now .
"So half a year ago , I decided to go to P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an myself ."
"So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of ph@@ ot@@ os I took while I was in P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an ."
"This is from the city of L@@ a@@ hor@@ e , which is around 3@@ 00 kilome@@ ters s@@ outh from A@@ b@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where B@@ in L@@ a@@ den was ca@@ u@@ ght ."
Here &apos;s a ty@@ pi@@ cal stre@@ et view .
"And here &apos;s the stre@@ et or ro@@ ad le@@ ading to this building , which is 7@@ 30 Ni@@ z@@ am blo@@ ck at Al@@ l@@ ama I@@ q@@ b@@ al T@@ own ."
And I k@@ noc@@ ked on the door .
( Laughter ) You want to gu@@ ess who open@@ ed the door ?
B@@ a@@ si@@ t and Am@@ j@@ ad ; they are still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is B@@ a@@ si@@ t .
S@@ it@@ ting down is his bro@@ ther Am@@ j@@ ad .
These are the guys who wro@@ te the first P@@ C vi@@ ru@@ s .
"Now of course , we had a very interesting di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion from lear@@ ning that both B@@ a@@ si@@ t and Am@@ j@@ ad had had their compu@@ ters in@@ fe@@ cted do@@ z@@ ens of times by completely un@@ re@@ lated other vi@@ rus@@ es over these years .
So there is some sort of ju@@ sti@@ ce in the world after all .
"Now , the vi@@ rus@@ es that we used to see in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s and 199@@ 0s obvi@@ ously are not a problem any more ."
So let me just show you a couple of exam@@ ples of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m ru@@ n@@ ning here is a system that en@@ ab@@ les me to run ag@@ e-@@ old progra@@ ms on a moder@@ n computer .
So let me just m@@ oun@@ t some dri@@ ves . G@@ o over there .
What we have here is a li@@ st of old vi@@ rus@@ es .
So let me just run some vi@@ rus@@ es on my computer .
"For example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de vi@@ ru@@ s first ."
"And you can see at the top of the scre@@ en , there &apos;s a cen@@ ti@@ pe@@ de sc@@ rol@@ ling across your computer when you get in@@ fe@@ cted by this one ."
You know that you &apos;re in@@ fe@@ cted because it actually shows up .
"H@@ ere &apos;s another one . This is the vi@@ ru@@ s called C@@ ra@@ sh , inv@@ en@@ ted in R@@ us@@ si@@ a in 199@@ 2 ."
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
"( S@@ i@@ re@@ n no@@ ise ) And the last example , gu@@ ess what the W@@ al@@ k@@ er vi@@ ru@@ s does ?"
"@@ Yes , there &apos;s a guy wal@@ king across your scre@@ en once you get in@@ fe@@ cted ."
"So it used to be fa@@ ir@@ ly e@@ asy to know that you &apos;re in@@ fe@@ cted by a vi@@ ru@@ s , when the vi@@ rus@@ es were wri@@ t@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ by@@ ist@@ s and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , they are no longer being wri@@ t@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ by@@ ist@@ s and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , vi@@ rus@@ es are a global problem ."
"What we have here in the back@@ ground is an example of our systems that we run in our lab@@ s , where we tr@@ ack vi@@ ru@@ s in@@ fe@@ ctions wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blo@@ cked vi@@ rus@@ es in S@@ we@@ den and T@@ a@@ i@@ wa@@ n and R@@ us@@ si@@ a and el@@ se@@ where .
"In fact , if I just conne@@ ct back to our la@@ b systems through the W@@ e@@ b , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many vi@@ rus@@ es , how many new exam@@ ples of mal@@ w@@ are we find every single day ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s the lat@@ est vi@@ ru@@ s we &apos;ve found , in a fi@@ le called S@@ er@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e@@ ."
"And we found it right over here three secon@@ ds ago — the pre@@ vi@@ ous one , six secon@@ ds ago ."
"And if we just sc@@ ro@@ ll around , it &apos;s just mas@@ sive ."
"We find ten@@ s of thousands , even hundre@@ ds of thousands ."
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of mal@@ w@@ are every single day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
"Well today , it &apos;s the organiz@@ ed cri@@ min@@ al g@@ an@@ gs writing these vi@@ rus@@ es because they make money with their vi@@ rus@@ es ."
It &apos;s g@@ an@@ gs like — let &apos;s go to G@@ ang@@ sta@@ Bu@@ ck@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
This is a we@@ b@@ site oper@@ ating in M@@ os@@ c@@ ow where these guys are bu@@ ying in@@ fe@@ cted compu@@ ters .
"So if you are a vi@@ ru@@ s wri@@ ter and you &apos;re cap@@ able of in@@ fe@@ cting W@@ in@@ dow@@ s compu@@ ters , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can se@@ ll those in@@ fe@@ cted compu@@ ters — somebody else &apos;s compu@@ ters — to these guys ."
And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those compu@@ ters .
So how do these guys then mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze those in@@ fe@@ cted compu@@ ters ?
"Well there &apos;s mul@@ ti@@ ple different ways , such as ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your on@@ line ban@@ king ac@@ coun@@ ts when you do on@@ line ban@@ king , or ke@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers ."
"K@@ ey@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers sil@@ ently si@@ t on your computer , hi@@ d@@ den from view , and they recor@@ d everything you ty@@ pe ."
So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Go@@ og@@ le sear@@ ch@@ es .
E@@ very single Go@@ og@@ le sear@@ ch you ty@@ pe is sa@@ ved and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
E@@ very single e@@ ma@@ il you write is sa@@ ved and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
S@@ ame thing with every single pas@@ s@@ word and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are s@@ es@@ sions where you go on@@ line and do on@@ line pur@@ ch@@ ases in any on@@ line stor@@ e .
"Because when you do pur@@ ch@@ ases in on@@ line sto@@ res , you will be ty@@ ping in your name , the deli@@ very ad@@ dre@@ ss , your cre@@ d@@ it car@@ d number and the cre@@ d@@ it car@@ d secu@@ ri@@ ty co@@ des ."
And here &apos;s an example of a fi@@ le we found from a ser@@ ver a couple of weeks ago .
"That &apos;s the cre@@ d@@ it car@@ d number , that &apos;s the ex@@ pi@@ r@@ ation d@@ ate , that &apos;s the secu@@ ri@@ ty c@@ od@@ e , and that &apos;s the name of the ow@@ ner of the car@@ d ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you ga@@ in ac@@ cess to other people &apos;s cre@@ d@@ it car@@ d information , you can just go on@@ line and bu@@ y whatever you want with this information ."
"And that , obvi@@ ously , is a problem ."
We now have a whole under@@ ground marke@@ t@@ place and business e@@ co@@ system built around on@@ line cri@@ me .
One example of how these guys actually are cap@@ able of mon@@ e@@ ti@@ z@@ ing their oper@@ ations : we go and have a look at the p@@ ages of I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L and sear@@ ch for wanted per@@ s@@ ons .
"We find guys like B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ d@@ in , ori@@ gin@@ ally from S@@ we@@ den , and his part@@ ner in cri@@ me , also list@@ ed on the I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L wanted p@@ ages , M@@ r. S@@ ha@@ il@@ es@@ h@@ k@@ um@@ ar J@@ a@@ in , a U.@@ S. ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ."
"These guys were ru@@ n@@ ning an oper@@ ation called I@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ U@@ . , a cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me oper@@ ation through which they net@@ ted mi@@ llions ."
They are both right now on the run .
N@@ ob@@ ody know@@ s where they are .
"U@@ .@@ S. offi@@ ci@@ als , just a couple of weeks ago , f@@ roz@@ e a S@@ wi@@ ss b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t be@@ lon@@ g@@ ing to M@@ r. J@@ a@@ in , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.@@ S. dollars on it ."
So the amount of money on@@ line cri@@ me gener@@ ates is sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant .
And that means that the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als can actually af@@ for@@ d to inv@@ est into their att@@ ac@@ ks .
"We know that on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are hi@@ ring progra@@ m@@ m@@ ers , hi@@ ring test@@ ing people , test@@ ing their c@@ od@@ e , having back@@ -@@ end systems with S@@ Q@@ L d@@ at@@ ab@@ ases ."
And they can af@@ for@@ d to wat@@ ch how we work — like how secu@@ ri@@ ty people work — and try to work their way around any secu@@ ri@@ ty pre@@ ca@@ u@@ tions we can build .
They also use the global nature of Inter@@ net to their adv@@ an@@ t@@ age .
"I mean , the Inter@@ net is inter@@ national ."
That &apos;s why we call it the Inter@@ net .
"And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the on@@ line world , here &apos;s a video built by C@@ lar@@ i@@ f@@ ied N@@ et@@ works , which il@@ lu@@ str@@ ates how one single mal@@ w@@ are family is able to move around the world ."
"This oper@@ ation , belie@@ ved to be ori@@ gin@@ ally from E@@ st@@ on@@ ia , mo@@ ves around from one country to another as so@@ on as the we@@ b@@ site is tr@@ ied to sh@@ u@@ t down ."
So you just can &apos;t sh@@ u@@ t these guys down .
"They will s@@ wit@@ ch from one country to another , from one ju@@ ri@@ s@@ di@@ ction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability to glob@@ ally poli@@ ce oper@@ ations like this ."
So the Inter@@ net is as if someone would have given f@@ ree pl@@ ane ti@@ c@@ ke@@ ts to all the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als of the world .
"Now , cri@@ min@@ als who wer@@ en &apos;t cap@@ able of re@@ ach@@ ing us before can re@@ ach us ."
So how do you actually go around fin@@ ding on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als ?
How do you actually tr@@ ack them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one ex@@ plo@@ it fi@@ le .
"H@@ ere , I &apos;m looking at the H@@ e@@ x du@@ m@@ p of an image fi@@ le , which con@@ ta@@ ins an ex@@ plo@@ it ."
"And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image fi@@ le on your W@@ in@@ dow@@ s computer , it actually takes over your computer and ru@@ ns c@@ od@@ e ."
"Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image fi@@ le — well there &apos;s the image he@@ a@@ der , and there the ac@@ tu@@ al c@@ od@@ e of the att@@ ack star@@ ts ."
"And that c@@ od@@ e has been en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted , so let &apos;s dec@@ ry@@ pt it ."
It has been en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted with X@@ O@@ R fun@@ ction 9@@ 7 .
"You just have to believe me , it is , it is ."
And we can go here and actually start dec@@ ry@@ p@@ ting it .
Well the y@@ el@@ low part of the c@@ od@@ e is now dec@@ ry@@ p@@ ted .
"And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the ori@@ gin@@ al ."
But just keep star@@ ing at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a W@@ e@@ b ad@@ dre@@ ss : uni@@ on@@ se@@ ek@@ .@@ co@@ m / d / i@@ o@@ o@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to dow@@ n@@ lo@@ ad and run that program .
And that &apos;s a back@@ door which will take over your computer .
"But even more interest@@ ing@@ ly , if we contin@@ ue dec@@ ry@@ p@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this m@@ yst@@ eri@@ ous str@@ ing , which says O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
That c@@ od@@ e is there under@@ ne@@ ath the en@@ c@@ ry@@ ption as some sort of a sig@@ nature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
"And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means ."
So obvi@@ ously I Go@@ og@@ led for it .
I got zer@@ o hi@@ ts ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I spo@@ ke with the guys at the la@@ b .
"And we have a couple of R@@ us@@ si@@ an guys in our lab@@ s , and one of them men@@ tion@@ ed , well , it en@@ ds in R@@ U@@ S like R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
And 7@@ 8 is the city c@@ od@@ e for the city of St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
"For example , you can find it from some phone num@@ bers and car li@@ cen@@ se pl@@ ates and stuff like that ."
"So I went looking for cont@@ ac@@ ts in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , and through a long ro@@ ad , we ev@@ en@@ tually found this one particular we@@ b@@ site ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s this R@@ us@@ si@@ an guy who &apos;s been oper@@ ating on@@ line for a number of years who ru@@ ns his own we@@ b@@ site , and he ru@@ ns a blo@@ g under the popul@@ ar Li@@ ve J@@ our@@ na@@ l ."
"And on this blo@@ g , he blo@@ gs about his life , about his life in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g — he &apos;s in his early 20@@ s — about his c@@ at , about his gir@@ l@@ friend ."
And he dri@@ ves a very nice car .
"In fact , this guy dri@@ ves a M@@ er@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ B@@ en@@ z S@@ 6@@ 00 V@@ 12 with a si@@ x@@ -@@ li@@ ter eng@@ ine with more than 4@@ 00 hor@@ se@@ power ."
Now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20@@ -@@ something year@@ -@@ old kid in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he blo@@ gg@@ ed about the car .
He actually had a car ac@@ ci@@ dent .
"In dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , he actually c@@ ra@@ shed his car into another car ."
And he put blo@@ gg@@ ed images about the car ac@@ ci@@ dent — that &apos;s his M@@ er@@ ce@@ des — right here is the L@@ ada S@@ am@@ ar@@ a he c@@ ra@@ shed into .
And you can actually see that the li@@ cen@@ se pl@@ ate of the S@@ am@@ ar@@ a en@@ ds in 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S .
"And if you actually take a look at the scen@@ e picture , you can see that the pl@@ ate of the M@@ er@@ ce@@ des is O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
"Now I &apos;m not a la@@ wy@@ er , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are ca@@ u@@ ght ?"
Well in most c@@ ases it never gets this far .
"The v@@ ast maj@@ ori@@ ty of the on@@ line cri@@ me c@@ ases , we don &apos;t even know which contin@@ ent the att@@ ac@@ ks are coming from ."
"And even if we are able to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als , quite often there is no out@@ come ."
"The local poli@@ ce don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evi@@ dence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down ."
I wi@@ sh it would be e@@ as@@ ier ; un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely it isn &apos;t .
But things are also chang@@ ing at a very ra@@ pi@@ d p@@ ace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like S@@ tu@@ x@@ net .
So if you look at what S@@ tu@@ x@@ net did is that it in@@ fe@@ cted these .
"That &apos;s a S@@ ie@@ men@@ s S@@ 7@@ -@@ 4@@ 00 P@@ L@@ C , progra@@ m@@ m@@ able logi@@ c &#91; contro@@ l@@ ler &#93; ."
And this is what ru@@ ns our in@@ fra@@ structure .
This is what ru@@ ns everything around us .
"P@@ L@@ C &apos;s , these small bo@@ x@@ es which have no disp@@ l@@ ay , no ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard , which are progra@@ m@@ med , are put in place , and they do their job ."
"For example , the ele@@ v@@ at@@ ors in this building most li@@ ke@@ ly are contro@@ l@@ led by one of these ."
"And when S@@ tu@@ x@@ net in@@ fe@@ cts one of these , that &apos;s a mas@@ sive re@@ v@@ olution on the kinds of ri@@ sk@@ s we have to wor@@ ry about ."
Because everything around us is being run by these .
"I mean , we have cri@@ tical in@@ fra@@ structure ."
"You go to any fac@@ t@@ ory , any power pl@@ ant , any chemi@@ cal pl@@ ant , any food pro@@ cess@@ ing pl@@ ant , you look around — everything is being run by compu@@ ters ."
E@@ very@@ thing is being run by compu@@ ters .
E@@ very@@ thing is reli@@ ant on these compu@@ ters working .
"We have become very reli@@ ant on Inter@@ net , on basi@@ c things like electri@@ city , obvi@@ ously , on compu@@ ters working ."
And this really is something which cre@@ ates completely new problems for us .
We must have some way of contin@@ u@@ ing to work even if compu@@ ters fa@@ il .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So pre@@ par@@ ed@@ ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for gran@@ ted ar@@ en &apos;t there .
"It &apos;s actually very basi@@ c stuff — thinking about contin@@ u@@ ity , thinking about bac@@ ku@@ ps , thinking about the things that actually matter ."
Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Inter@@ net . I do .
Th@@ in@@ k about all the ser@@ vi@@ ces we have on@@ line .
"Th@@ in@@ k about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another ."
"I see beau@@ ty in the future of the Inter@@ net , but I &apos;m wor@@ ried that we might not see that ."
I &apos;m wor@@ ried that we are ru@@ n@@ ning into problems because of on@@ line cri@@ me .
O@@ n@@ line cri@@ me is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life def@@ ending the N@@ et , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fi@@ ght on@@ line cri@@ me , we are ru@@ n@@ ning a ri@@ sk of lo@@ sing it all ."
"We have to do this glob@@ ally , and we have to do it right now ."
"What we need is more global , inter@@ national la@@ w en@@ for@@ c@@ ement work to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ al g@@ an@@ gs — these organiz@@ ed g@@ an@@ gs that are making mi@@ llions out of their att@@ ac@@ ks ."
That &apos;s much more important than ru@@ n@@ ning anti@@ -@@ vi@@ rus@@ es or ru@@ n@@ ning fi@@ re@@ wal@@ ls .
"What actually mat@@ ters is actually fin@@ ding the people behind these att@@ ac@@ ks , and even more import@@ an@@ tly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this on@@ line world of cri@@ me , but ha@@ ven &apos;t yet done it ."
"We have to find the people with the sk@@ il@@ ls , but without the opportuni@@ ties and give them the opportuni@@ ties to use their sk@@ il@@ ls for good ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is chang@@ ing with really re@@ mark@@ able speed .
"If you look at the char@@ t at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 20@@ 25 , these G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s proje@@ ctions su@@ ggest that the Chin@@ ese econom@@ y will be almost the same size as the American econom@@ y ."
"And if you look at the char@@ t for 20@@ 50 , it &apos;s proje@@ cted that the Chin@@ ese econom@@ y will be t@@ wi@@ ce the size of the American econom@@ y , and the Indi@@ an econom@@ y will be almost the same size as the American econom@@ y ."
And we should be@@ ar in mind here that these proje@@ ctions were d@@ raw@@ n up before the W@@ est@@ er@@ n fin@@ an@@ cial cri@@ sis .
"A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the lat@@ est proje@@ ction by B@@ N@@ P P@@ ari@@ b@@ as for when China will have a lar@@ ger econom@@ y than the United States ."
G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s proje@@ cted 20@@ 2@@ 7 .
The post@@ -@@ cri@@ sis proje@@ ction is 20@@ 20 .
That &apos;s just a dec@@ ade away .
China is going to change the world in two fundam@@ ent@@ al re@@ spe@@ cts .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s a huge develo@@ ping country with a popul@@ ation of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people , which has been grow@@ ing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year ."
"And within a dec@@ ade , it will have the largest econom@@ y in the world ."
"N@@ ever before in the moder@@ n era has the largest econom@@ y in the world been that of a develo@@ ping country , rather than a develo@@ ped country ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , for the first time in the moder@@ n era , the dom@@ in@@ ant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the W@@ est and from very , very different ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ational ro@@ ots ."
"Now , I know it &apos;s a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad as@@ sum@@ ption in the W@@ est that as countries moder@@ ni@@ ze , they also we@@ ster@@ ni@@ ze ."
This is an il@@ lu@@ sion .
"It &apos;s an as@@ sum@@ ption that moder@@ ni@@ ty is a produ@@ ct simply of compe@@ ti@@ tion , marke@@ ts and technology ."
It is not . It is also sha@@ ped equ@@ ally by history and culture .
"Ch@@ ina is not like the W@@ est , and it will not become like the W@@ est ."
It will re@@ ma@@ in in very fundam@@ ent@@ al re@@ spe@@ cts very different .
"Now the big question here is obvi@@ ously , how do we make sense of China ?"
How do we try to understand what China is ?
"And the problem we have in the W@@ est at the moment , by and large , is that the con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal appro@@ ach is that we understand it really in W@@ est@@ er@@ n terms , using W@@ est@@ er@@ n ideas ."
We can &apos;t .
"Now I want to of@@ f@@ er you three building blo@@ cks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning ."
The first is this : that China is not really a n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state .
"O@@ kay , it &apos;s called itself a n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state for the last hundre@@ d years , but everyone who know@@ s anything about China know@@ s it &apos;s a lot ol@@ der than this ."
This was what China looked like with the vi@@ ct@@ ory of the Q@@ in D@@ y@@ na@@ sty in 2@@ 2@@ 1 B@@ .@@ C@@ . at the end of the war@@ r@@ ing@@ -@@ state per@@ i@@ od — the bir@@ th of moder@@ n China .
And you can see it against the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies of moder@@ n China .
"O@@ r im@@ medi@@ ately af@@ ter@@ ward , the H@@ an D@@ y@@ na@@ sty , still 2@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And you can see already it oc@@ cu@@ pie@@ s most of what we now know as E@@ ast@@ er@@ n China , which is where the v@@ ast maj@@ ori@@ ty of Chin@@ ese li@@ ved then and live now ."
"Now what is ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary about this is , what gi@@ ves China its sense of being China , what gi@@ ves the Chin@@ ese the sense of what it is to be Chin@@ ese , comes not from the last hundre@@ d years , not from the n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state per@@ i@@ od , which is what happened in the W@@ est , but from the per@@ i@@ od , if you like , of the ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ati@@ on-@@ state ."
"I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of cu@@ st@@ oms like an@@ c@@ est@@ ral wor@@ ship , of a very di@@ st@@ in@@ ctive noti@@ on of the state , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , a very di@@ st@@ in@@ ctive noti@@ on of the family , social relation@@ ships like gu@@ an@@ x@@ i , Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an val@@ u@@ es and so on ."
These are all things that come from the per@@ i@@ od of the ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ati@@ on-@@ state .
"In other words , China , un@@ like the W@@ est@@ er@@ n st@@ ates and most countries in the world , is sha@@ ped by its sense of ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , its ex@@ ist@@ ence as a ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ati@@ on-@@ state , rather than as a n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state ."
"And there &apos;s one other thing to ad@@ d to this , and that is this : O@@ f course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demo@@ gra@@ phi@@ cally and ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cally , with a popul@@ ation of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people ."
"What we often ar@@ en &apos;t really aw@@ are of is the fact that China is extre@@ me@@ ly di@@ verse and very p@@ lu@@ r@@ ali@@ stic , and in many ways very de@@ cen@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed ."
"You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing , even though we think this to be the case ."
It &apos;s never been the case .
"So this is China , a ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ati@@ on-@@ state , rather than a n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state ."
And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think it has all sor@@ ts of pro@@ found im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations ."
I &apos;ll give you two qui@@ ck ones .
"The first is that the most important poli@@ tical val@@ ue for the Chin@@ ese is uni@@ ty , is the ma@@ inten@@ ance of Chin@@ ese ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation ."
"You know , 2@@ ,000 years ago , Europ@@ e : bre@@ ak@@ down — the fra@@ g@@ ment@@ ation of the H@@ o@@ ly R@@ om@@ an E@@ m@@ pi@@ re ."
"It di@@ vi@@ ded , and it &apos;s re@@ ma@@ ined di@@ vi@@ ded ever since ."
"Ch@@ ina , over the same time per@@ i@@ od , went in exactly the op@@ posi@@ te dire@@ ction , very pain@@ fully hol@@ ding this huge ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ati@@ on-@@ state , together ."
"The second is maybe more pro@@ sa@@ ic , which is H@@ ong K@@ ong ."
Do you remember the h@@ an@@ do@@ ver of H@@ ong K@@ ong by Bri@@ tain to China in 199@@ 7 ?
You may remember what the Chin@@ ese con@@ stitu@@ ti@@ onal pro@@ posi@@ tion was .
"One country , two systems ."
And I &apos;ll l@@ ay a wa@@ ger that bar@@ ely any@@ one in the W@@ est belie@@ ved them .
&quot; &quot; W@@ in@@ do@@ w dre@@ s@@ sing .
"When China gets its h@@ ands on H@@ ong K@@ ong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ir@@ te@@ en years on , the poli@@ tical and leg@@ al system in H@@ ong K@@ ong is as different now as it was in 199@@ 7 ."
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
"We were wrong because we thought , natur@@ ally enough , in n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state ways ."
"Th@@ in@@ k of G@@ er@@ man uni@@ fi@@ cation , 199@@ 0 ."
What happened ?
"Well , basically the E@@ ast was s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed by the W@@ est ."
"One n@@ ation , one system ."
That is the n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state ment@@ ality .
"But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ati@@ on-@@ state , on the basi@@ s of one ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , one system ."
It doesn &apos;t work .
"So actually the respon@@ se of China to the question of H@@ ong K@@ ong — as it will be to the question of T@@ a@@ i@@ wa@@ n — was a natural respon@@ se : one ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , many systems ."
Let me of@@ f@@ er you another building blo@@ ck to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfor@@ table one .
"The Chin@@ ese have a very , very different con@@ cep@@ tion of rac@@ e to most other countries ."
"D@@ o you know , of the 1@@ .@@ 3 billion Chin@@ ese , over 90 percent of them think they be@@ long to the same rac@@ e , the H@@ an ?"
"Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most popul@@ ous countries ."
"In@@ di@@ a , the United States , In@@ d@@ one@@ si@@ a , B@@ raz@@ il — all of them are mul@@ ti@@ rac@@ i@@ al ."
The Chin@@ ese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only mul@@ ti@@ rac@@ i@@ al really at the mar@@ gin@@ s .
"So the question is , why ?"
"Well the reason , I think , essen@@ ti@@ ally is , again , back to the ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ati@@ on-@@ state ."
"A history of at least 2@@ ,000 years , a history of con@@ qu@@ est , oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ation , ab@@ sor@@ ption , as@@ si@@ mi@@ l@@ ation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this noti@@ on of the H@@ an em@@ er@@ g@@ ed — of course , n@@ ur@@ tu@@ red by a grow@@ ing and very powerful sense of cul@@ tu@@ ral iden@@ ti@@ ty ."
"Now the great adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of this histori@@ cal experience has been that , without the H@@ an , China could never have he@@ ld together ."
The H@@ an iden@@ ti@@ ty has been the c@@ ement which has he@@ ld this country together .
The great dis@@ adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of it is that the H@@ an have a very we@@ ak con@@ cep@@ tion of cul@@ tu@@ ral difference .
"They really believe in their own super@@ i@@ ori@@ ty , and they are dis@@ re@@ spe@@ ct@@ ful of those who are not ."
"H@@ ence their at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , for example , to the U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur@@ s and to the Ti@@ bet@@ ans ."
"O@@ r let me give you my third building blo@@ ck , the Chin@@ ese state ."
Now the relation@@ ship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the W@@ est .
Now we in the W@@ est over@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly se@@ em to think — in these days at least — that the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty and le@@ gi@@ ti@@ m@@ acy of the state is a fun@@ ction of de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y .
The problem with this pro@@ posi@@ tion is that the Chin@@ ese state en@@ jo@@ ys more le@@ gi@@ ti@@ m@@ acy and more au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty am@@ on@@ g@@ st the Chin@@ ese than is true with any W@@ est@@ er@@ n state .
"And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reas@@ ons , I think ."
"And it &apos;s obvi@@ ously got nothing to do with de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y , because in our terms the Chin@@ ese cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t have a de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y ."
"And the reason for this is , fir@@ st@@ ly , because the state in China is given a very spe@@ cial — it en@@ jo@@ ys a very spe@@ cial sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ance as the re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative , the em@@ bod@@ im@@ ent and the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an of Chin@@ ese ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , of the ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ati@@ on-@@ state ."
This is as close as China gets to a kind of spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al ro@@ le .
"And the second reason is because , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as in Europ@@ e and Nor@@ th America , the state &apos;s power is contin@@ u@@ ously challen@@ g@@ ed — I mean in the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an tra@@ di@@ tion , histori@@ cally against the ch@@ ur@@ ch , against other se@@ ct@@ ors of the ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ rac@@ y , against mer@@ ch@@ an@@ ts and so on — for 1@@ ,000 years , the power of the Chin@@ ese state has not been challen@@ g@@ ed ."
It &apos;s had no seri@@ ous ri@@ v@@ als .
So you can see that the way in which power has been con@@ stru@@ cted in China is very different from our experience in W@@ est@@ er@@ n history .
"The resul@@ t , by the way , is that the Chin@@ ese have a very different view of the state ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as we ten@@ d to view it as an in@@ tru@@ der , a str@@ ang@@ er , cer@@ tain@@ ly an or@@ g@@ an wh@@ ose pow@@ ers need to be li@@ mi@@ ted or de@@ fin@@ ed and con@@ stra@@ ined , the Chin@@ ese don &apos;t see the state like that at all ."
"The Chin@@ ese view the state as an in@@ ti@@ m@@ ate — not just as an in@@ ti@@ m@@ ate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch of the family ."
"This is the Chin@@ ese view of the state — very , very different to ours ."
It &apos;s em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the W@@ est .
"And I would su@@ ggest to you that actually what we are de@@ al@@ ing with here , in the Chin@@ ese con@@ te@@ xt , is a new kind of par@@ ad@@ ig@@ m , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past ."
K@@ now that China belie@@ ves in the market and the state .
"I mean , A@@ d@@ am S@@ mi@@ th , already writing in the l@@ ate 1@@ 8@@ th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chin@@ ese market is lar@@ ger and more develo@@ ped and more s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated than anything in Europ@@ e . &quot; &quot; And , a@@ part from the Ma@@ o per@@ i@@ od , that has re@@ ma@@ ined more or less the case ever since ."
But this is com@@ b@@ ined with an extre@@ me@@ ly stron@@ g and u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous state .
The state is every@@ where in China .
"I mean , it &apos;s le@@ ading fir@@ ms — many of them are still publi@@ c@@ ly ow@@ ned ."
"P@@ ri@@ v@@ ate fir@@ ms , h@@ ow@@ ever large they are , like L@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ o , de@@ p@@ end in many ways on state pat@@ ro@@ na@@ ge ."
T@@ ar@@ gets for the econom@@ y and so on are set by the state .
"And the state , of course , its au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty f@@ low@@ s into lots of other are@@ as — as we are fami@@ li@@ ar with — with something like the one@@ -@@ child poli@@ cy ."
"Mo@@ re@@ over , this is a very old state tra@@ di@@ tion , a very old tra@@ di@@ tion of st@@ ate@@ c@@ ra@@ ft ."
"I mean , if you want an il@@ lu@@ str@@ ation of this , the Gre@@ at W@@ all is one ."
"But this is another , this is the G@@ r@@ and C@@ an@@ al , which was con@@ stru@@ cted in the first in@@ stance in the fi@@ f@@ th century B@@ .@@ C@@ ."
and was finally comple@@ ted in the se@@ ven@@ th century A@@ .@@ D@@ .
"It went for 1@@ ,@@ 1@@ 14 miles , lin@@ king Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing with H@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou and S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i ."
"So there &apos;s a long history of ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary state in@@ fra@@ stru@@ ctu@@ ral proje@@ cts in China , which I sup@@ pos@@ e hel@@ ps us to expla@@ in what we see today , which is something like the Th@@ ree G@@ or@@ ges D@@ am and many other ex@@ pres@@ sions of state compe@@ ten@@ ce within China ."
"So there we have three building blo@@ cks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ati@@ on-@@ state , the noti@@ on of rac@@ e and the nature of the state and its relation@@ ship to society ."
"And yet we still in@@ si@@ st , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply d@@ raw@@ ing on W@@ est@@ er@@ n experience , looking at it through W@@ est@@ er@@ n eyes , using W@@ est@@ er@@ n con@@ cep@@ ts ."
If you want to know why we un@@ er@@ r@@ ing@@ ly se@@ em to get China wrong — our pre@@ di@@ ctions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are in@@ cor@@ re@@ ct — this is the reason .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , I think , I have to say that I think at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de towar@@ ds China is that of a kind of little W@@ est@@ er@@ ner ment@@ ality ."
It &apos;s kind of ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant .
"It &apos;s ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant in the sense that we think that we are best , and ther@@ e@@ fore we have the uni@@ vers@@ al meas@@ ure ."
"And secon@@ d@@ ly , it &apos;s ig@@ nor@@ ant ."
We ref@@ use to really ad@@ dre@@ ss the issue of difference .
"You know , there &apos;s a very interesting pas@@ s@@ age in a book by P@@ au@@ l Co@@ h@@ en , the American histori@@ an ."
And P@@ au@@ l Co@@ h@@ en ar@@ gu@@ es that the W@@ est thin@@ ks of itself as probably the most co@@ smo@@ po@@ lit@@ an of all cul@@ tu@@ res .
But it &apos;s not .
"In many ways , it &apos;s the most pa@@ ro@@ chi@@ al , because for 2@@ 00 years , the W@@ est has been so dom@@ in@@ ant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cul@@ tu@@ res , other ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations ."
"Because , at the end of the day , it could , if ne@@ cess@@ ary by force , get its own way ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as those cul@@ tu@@ res — vi@@ r@@ tually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far we@@ ak@@ er posi@@ tion , vi@@ s@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ v@@ is the W@@ est — have been ther@@ e@@ by for@@ ced to understand the W@@ est , because of the W@@ est &apos;s pre@@ sen@@ ce in those socie@@ ties ."
"And ther@@ e@@ fore , they are , as a resul@@ t , more co@@ smo@@ po@@ lit@@ an in many ways than the W@@ est ."
"I mean , take the question of E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a : J@@ ap@@ an , Kore@@ a , China , et@@ c . — a third of the world &apos;s popul@@ ation lives there ."
Now the largest economic regi@@ on in the world .
"And I &apos;ll tell you now , that E@@ ast A@@ si@@ an@@ ers , people from E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a , are far more know@@ le@@ d@@ ge@@ able about the W@@ est than the W@@ est is about E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"Now this point is very ger@@ m@@ ane , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id , to the present ."
"Because what &apos;s happening ? B@@ ack to that char@@ t at the beginning , the G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s char@@ t ."
"What is happening is that , very ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly in histori@@ cal terms , the world is being dri@@ ven and sha@@ ped , not by the old develo@@ ped countries , but by the develo@@ ping world ."
"We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G@@ 20 us@@ ur@@ ping very ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly the posi@@ tion of the G@@ 7 , or the G@@ 8 ."
And there are two con@@ sequ@@ ences of this .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the W@@ est is ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly lo@@ sing its in@@ flu@@ ence in the world ."
"There was a dra@@ m@@ atic il@@ lu@@ str@@ ation of this actually a year ago — C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en , clim@@ ate change con@@ fer@@ ence ."
Europ@@ e was not at the fin@@ al neg@@ oti@@ ating table .
When did that last happen ?
I would wa@@ ger it was probably about 2@@ 00 years ago .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
"And the second im@@ p@@ lic@@ ation is that the world will in@@ evi@@ t@@ ably , as a con@@ sequ@@ ence , become incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly un@@ fami@@ li@@ ar to us , because it &apos;ll be sha@@ ped by cul@@ tu@@ res and exper@@ ien@@ ces and histor@@ ies that we are not really fami@@ li@@ ar with , or convers@@ ant with ."
"And at last , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id — take Europ@@ e ; America is sli@@ gh@@ tly different — but Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans by and large , I have to say , are ig@@ nor@@ ant , are u@@ naw@@ are about the way the world is chang@@ ing ."
"S@@ ome people — I &apos;ve got an En@@ g@@ li@@ sh friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The contin@@ ent is sle@@ e@@ p@@ wal@@ king into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation ."
But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europ@@ e is incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly out of tou@@ ch with the world — and that is a sort of lo@@ ss of a sense of the future .
"I mean , Europ@@ e once , of course , once com@@ man@@ ded the future in its con@@ fi@@ dence ."
"T@@ ake the 19@@ th century , for example ."
"But this , al@@ as , is no longer true ."
"If you want to feel the future , if you want to ta@@ ste the future , try China — there &apos;s old Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us ."
This is a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation the li@@ k@@ es of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation .
This is the new &#91; W@@ u@@ h@@ an &#93; ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation for the high-@@ speed tra@@ ins .
China already has a bi@@ g@@ ger network than any other country in the world and will so@@ on have more than all the rest of the world put together .
"O@@ r take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tr@@ ied out shor@@ tly in a su@@ bur@@ b of Be@@ i@@ j@@ ing ."
"H@@ ere you have a me@@ g@@ ab@@ us , on the u@@ pp@@ er de@@ ck car@@ r@@ ies about 2@@ ,000 people ."
"It tra@@ v@@ els on ra@@ il@@ s down a su@@ bur@@ b@@ an ro@@ ad , and the cars tra@@ vel under@@ ne@@ ath it ."
And it does spe@@ eds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
"Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very speci@@ fic problem , which is different from Europ@@ e and different from the United States : China has huge num@@ bers of people and no space ."
"So this is a solution to a situ@@ ation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people ."
"O@@ kay , so how would I like to fin@@ is@@ h ?"
"Well , what should our at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de be towar@@ ds this world that we see very ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly develo@@ ping before us ?"
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
"But I want to ar@@ gu@@ e , ab@@ o@@ ve all , a bi@@ g@@ -@@ picture posi@@ tive for this world ."
"For 2@@ 00 years , the world was essen@@ ti@@ ally gover@@ ned by a fra@@ g@@ ment of the human popul@@ ation ."
That &apos;s what Europ@@ e and Nor@@ th America re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted .
"The ar@@ ri@@ v@@ al of countries like China and Indi@@ a — between them 3@@ 8 percent of the world &apos;s popul@@ ation — and others like In@@ d@@ one@@ si@@ a and B@@ raz@@ il and so on , re@@ present the most important single act of de@@ moc@@ r@@ ati@@ z@@ ation in the last 2@@ 00 years ."
"C@@ i@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and cul@@ tu@@ res , which had been ig@@ no@@ red , which had no vo@@ ice , which were not list@@ en@@ ed to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation in this world ."
"As hum@@ ani@@ sts , we must wel@@ come , su@@ re@@ ly , this trans@@ form@@ ation , and we will have to learn about these ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations ."
"This big ship here was the one sa@@ i@@ led in by Z@@ h@@ en@@ g He in the early 1@@ 5@@ th century on his great vo@@ y@@ ages around the S@@ outh China Se@@ a , the E@@ ast China Se@@ a and across the Indi@@ an O@@ ce@@ an to E@@ ast Africa ."
"The little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Ch@@ ri@@ stop@@ her Col@@ um@@ bu@@ s cro@@ s@@ sed the At@@ lan@@ tic ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ r , look car@@ e@@ fully at this sil@@ k sc@@ ro@@ ll made by Z@@ hu@@ Z@@ h@@ ou in 1@@ 3@@ 6@@ 8 ."
I think they &apos;re playing g@@ ol@@ f .
"Ch@@ ri@@ st , the Chin@@ ese even inv@@ en@@ ted g@@ ol@@ f ."
W@@ el@@ come to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to start a re@@ v@@ olution .
"Now before you get up in ar@@ ms , or you bre@@ ak into s@@ ong , or you pi@@ ck a fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te color , I want to def@@ ine what I mean by re@@ v@@ olution ."
"B@@ y re@@ v@@ olution , I mean a dra@@ stic and far@@ -@@ re@@ ach@@ ing change in the way we think and be@@ have — the way we think and the way we be@@ have ."
"Now why , Ste@@ ve , why do we need a re@@ v@@ olution ?"
We need a re@@ v@@ olution because things ar@@ en &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
And that makes me really sa@@ d because I &apos;m si@@ ck and ti@@ red of things not working .
"You know , I &apos;m si@@ ck and ti@@ red of us not living up to our poten@@ tial ."
I &apos;m si@@ ck and ti@@ red of us being last .
"And we are last place in so many things — for example , social fac@@ t@@ ors ."
We &apos;re last place in Europ@@ e in in@@ no@@ vation .
"There we are right at the end , right at the bot@@ tom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t val@@ ue in@@ no@@ vation ."
"We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of wel@@ l-@@ being ."
"And there we are , not just last in the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , we &apos;re last in Europ@@ e , at the very bot@@ tom ."
"And wor@@ st of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The E@@ con@@ omi@@ st ."
"We &apos;re the s@@ ad@@ d@@ est place on Earth , rel@@ ative to G@@ D@@ P per ca@@ pi@@ ta — the s@@ ad@@ d@@ est place on Earth ."
That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
W@@ here do we ran@@ k three weeks ago in another re@@ port by the O@@ E@@ C@@ D ?
"L@@ ast in re@@ ading , mat@@ h and science . L@@ ast ."
B@@ us@@ iness : The low@@ est per@@ cep@@ tion in the E@@ .@@ U@@ .
that ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s provi@@ de b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts to society .
"Wh@@ y as a resul@@ t , what happens ?"
The low@@ est per@@ cent@@ age of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s star@@ ting bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es .
And this is des@@ pi@@ te the fact that everybody know@@ s that small business is the eng@@ ine of econom@@ ies .
We hi@@ re the most people ; we create the most ta@@ x@@ es .
"So if our eng@@ ine &apos;s bro@@ k@@ en , gu@@ ess what ?"
L@@ ast in Europ@@ e G@@ D@@ P per ca@@ pi@@ ta .
L@@ ast .
"So it &apos;s no sur@@ pri@@ se , guys , that 6@@ 2 percent of Bu@@ l@@ g@@ ari@@ ans are not op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic about the future ."
"We &apos;re un@@ happy , we have bad education , and we have the wor@@ st bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es ."
"And these are fac@@ ts , guys ."
This isn &apos;t story t@@ ale ; it &apos;s not mak@@ e-@@ believe .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a con@@ spi@@ rac@@ y I have got against Bu@@ l@@ gar@@ ia . These are fac@@ ts .
"So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is bro@@ k@@ en ."
"The way we think , the way we be@@ have , our oper@@ ating system of be@@ having is bro@@ k@@ en ."
"We need a dra@@ stic change in the way we think and be@@ have to trans@@ form Bu@@ l@@ gar@@ ia for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future ."
How did this happen ?
Let &apos;s be posi@@ tive now . We &apos;re going to get posi@@ tive . How did this happen ?
I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be dra@@ stic to some of you — because we are h@@ an@@ di@@ ca@@ pping ourselves .
We &apos;re hol@@ ding ourselves back because we don &apos;t val@@ ue play .
"I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right ."
"In case some of you for@@ got what play is , this is what play looks like ."
"B@@ ab@@ ies play , kids play , ad@@ ul@@ ts play ."
We don &apos;t val@@ ue play .
"In fact , we de@@ val@@ ue play ."
And we de@@ val@@ ue it in three are@@ as .
Let &apos;s go back to the same three are@@ as .
S@@ o@@ cial : 4@@ 5 years of what ?
"O@@ f communi@@ sm — of val@@ u@@ ing the society and the state over the individu@@ al and squ@@ ash@@ ing , in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently , cre@@ ati@@ vity , individu@@ al self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion and in@@ no@@ vation ."
"And instead , what do we val@@ ue ?"
"Because it &apos;s sh@@ own the way we app@@ ly , gener@@ ate and use know@@ le@@ dge is af@@ fe@@ cted by our social and institu@@ ti@@ onal con@@ te@@ xt , which told us what in communi@@ sm ?"
To be seri@@ ous .
"To be really , really seri@@ ous ."
It did .
( Applause ) B@@ e seri@@ ous .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been sc@@ ol@@ ded in the par@@ k for le@@ tting my kids play on the ground .
"H@@ e@@ a@@ ven for@@ bi@@ d they play in the di@@ r@@ t , the k@@ al , or even wor@@ se , lo@@ k@@ v@@ i , water — that will ki@@ ll them ."
I have been told by b@@ ab@@ as and dy@@ ad@@ os that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is seri@@ ous and we need to tra@@ in them for the seri@@ ous@@ ness of life .
We have a seri@@ ous me@@ me ru@@ n@@ ning through .
It &apos;s a social gen@@ e ru@@ n@@ ning through us .
It &apos;s a seri@@ ous gen@@ e .
It &apos;s 4@@ 5 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; b@@ ab@@ a fac@@ tor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
"S@@ te@@ p one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a b@@ aby . I@@ sk@@ am b@@ aby . &quot; &quot; Ste@@ p two : we get the b@@ aby . W@@ o@@ o@@ ho@@ o !"
But then what happens in ste@@ p three ?
I want to go back to work because I need to f@@ ur@@ ther my car@@ e@@ er or I just want to go have co@@ f@@ fe@@ es .
I &apos;m going to give be@@ b@@ ko to b@@ ab@@ a .
But we need to remember that b@@ ab@@ a &apos;s been in@@ fe@@ cted by the seri@@ ous me@@ me for 4@@ 5 years .
So what happens ?
"S@@ he pas@@ ses that vi@@ ru@@ s on to b@@ aby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the re@@ d@@ wood tre@@ es — for that seri@@ ous me@@ me to get out of our oper@@ ating system ."
What happens then ?
"It goes into education where we have an anti@@ qu@@ ated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that val@@ u@@ es ro@@ te lear@@ ning , memor@@ i@@ z@@ ation and stan@@ dar@@ di@@ z@@ ation , and de@@ val@@ u@@ es self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , self-@@ expl@@ or@@ ation , questi@@ on@@ ing , cre@@ ati@@ vity and play ."
It &apos;s a c@@ ra@@ p system .
T@@ ru@@ e story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
We went to this pre@@ sti@@ gi@@ ous little school and they say they &apos;re going to study mat@@ h 10 times a week and science eight times a week and re@@ ading five times a day and all this stuff .
"And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and re@@ cess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ a . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the s@@ che@@ du@@ le . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a cri@@ me . What a cri@@ me ."
"And it &apos;s a cri@@ me that our education system is so seri@@ ous because education is seri@@ ous that we &apos;re cre@@ ating min@@ d@@ less , rob@@ oti@@ c wor@@ k@@ ers to put b@@ ol@@ ts in pre@@ -@@ dri@@ l@@ led ho@@ les ."
"But I &apos;m sor@@ ry , the problems of today are not the problems of the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ ev@@ olution ."
"We need ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ability , the ability to learn how to be cre@@ ative and in@@ no@@ v@@ ative ."
We don &apos;t need mechani@@ zed wor@@ k@@ ers .
"But no , now our me@@ me goes into work where we don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"We create rob@@ oti@@ c wor@@ k@@ ers that we tre@@ at like as@@ se@@ ts , to le@@ ver and just th@@ row away ."
What are qu@@ ali@@ ties of a Bu@@ l@@ g@@ ari@@ an work ?
Au@@ to@@ c@@ r@@ atic — do what I say because I &apos;m the che@@ f .
I &apos;m the b@@ os@@ s and I know better than you .
"U@@ n@@ tru@@ st@@ ing — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously a cri@@ min@@ al , so I &apos;m going to in@@ st@@ all cam@@ er@@ as ."
"( Laughter ) Con@@ tro@@ l@@ ling — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously an i@@ di@@ ot , so I &apos;m going to make a z@@ il@@ li@@ on little pro@@ cess@@ es for you to fol@@ low so you don &apos;t ste@@ p out of the box ."
"So they &apos;re re@@ stri@@ ctive — don &apos;t use your mo@@ bi@@ le phone , don &apos;t use your lap@@ top , don &apos;t sear@@ ch the Inter@@ net , don &apos;t be on I@@ .@@ M@@ ."
That &apos;s some@@ how un@@ prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal and bad .
"And at the end of the day , it &apos;s un@@ fu@@ l@@ fil@@ ling because you &apos;re contro@@ l@@ led , you &apos;re re@@ stri@@ cted , you &apos;re not val@@ u@@ ed and you &apos;re not having any fun ."
"In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , Ste@@ ve . What a du@@ m@@ b idea ."
It can &apos;t be because of play .
"J@@ ust play , that &apos;s a stu@@ pi@@ d thing . &quot; &quot; We have the seri@@ ous me@@ me in us ."
Well I &apos;m going to say no .
"And I will pro@@ ve it to you in the next part of the spe@@ e@@ ch — that play is the cat@@ al@@ y@@ st , it is the re@@ v@@ olution , that we can use to trans@@ form Bu@@ l@@ gar@@ ia for the better ."
P@@ l@@ ay : our bra@@ ins are har@@ d@@ wi@@ red for play .
"E@@ v@@ olution has se@@ le@@ cted , over mi@@ llions and bi@@ llions of years , for play in animals and in hum@@ ans ."
And you know what ?
"E@@ v@@ olution does a really , really good job of des@@ ele@@ cting tra@@ its that ar@@ en &apos;t adv@@ an@@ t@@ ag@@ e@@ ous to us and se@@ le@@ cting tra@@ its for compe@@ ti@@ tive adv@@ an@@ t@@ age ."
"N@@ ature isn &apos;t stu@@ pi@@ d , and it se@@ le@@ cted for play ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out the ani@@ mal k@@ ing@@ dom , for example : an@@ ts . An@@ ts play ."
Ma@@ ybe you didn &apos;t know that .

"R@@ ats play , but what you might not have known is that rat@@ s that play more have bi@@ g@@ ger bra@@ ins and they learn t@@ as@@ ks better , sk@@ il@@ ls ."
K@@ it@@ ten@@ s play . We all know k@@ it@@ ten@@ s play .
But what you may not know is that k@@ it@@ ten@@ s de@@ pri@@ ved of play are u@@ na@@ ble to inter@@ act so@@ cially .
"They can still hun@@ t , but they can &apos;t be social ."
B@@ ear@@ s play .
But what you may not know is that be@@ ars that play more survi@@ ve longer .
It &apos;s not the be@@ ars that learn how to fish better .
It &apos;s the ones that play more .
"And a fin@@ al really interesting study — it &apos;s been sh@@ own , a cor@@ rel@@ ation between play and brain size ."
"The more you play , the bi@@ g@@ ger the bra@@ ins there are ."

We &apos;re desig@@ ned by nature to play from bir@@ th to old age .
We &apos;re desig@@ ned to do that contin@@ u@@ ously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
It is a huge b@@ en@@ ef@@ it .
"J@@ ust like there &apos;s b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts to animals , there &apos;s b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts to hum@@ ans ."
"For example , it &apos;s been sh@@ own to sti@@ mul@@ ate neu@@ ral grow@@ th in the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a , in the area where it contro@@ ls emoti@@ ons ."
It &apos;s been sh@@ own to pro@@ mot@@ e pre@@ -@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x develo@@ pment where a lot of cogni@@ tion is happening .
"As a resul@@ t , what happens ?"
We develo@@ p more emoti@@ onal mat@@ u@@ ri@@ ty if we play more .
We develo@@ p better deci@@ si@@ on-@@ making ability if we play more .
These guys are fac@@ ts .
"It &apos;s not fi@@ ction , it &apos;s not story tal@@ es , it &apos;s not mak@@ e-@@ believe ; it &apos;s c@@ old , hard science ."
These are the b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts to play .
"It is a gen@@ e@@ tic bir@@ th@@ right that we have , like wal@@ king or spe@@ aking or seeing ."
"And if we h@@ an@@ di@@ ca@@ p ourselves with play , we h@@ an@@ di@@ ca@@ p ourselves as if we would with any other bir@@ th@@ right that we have ."
We h@@ old ourselves back .
L@@ it@@ tle ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
"I@@ mag@@ ine a world without the@@ ater , without the ar@@ ts , without s@@ ong , without dan@@ cing , without so@@ c@@ cer , without fo@@ ot@@ ball , without l@@ aughter ."
What does this world look like ?
It &apos;s pretty b@@ le@@ ak .
It &apos;s pretty g@@ lu@@ m .
Now imagine your wor@@ k@@ place .
Is it fun ? Is it pla@@ y@@ ful ?
O@@ r maybe the wor@@ k@@ place of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
Is it fun ? Is it pla@@ y@@ ful ?
"O@@ r is it c@@ ra@@ p ? Is it au@@ to@@ c@@ r@@ atic , contro@@ l@@ ling , re@@ stri@@ ctive and un@@ tru@@ st@@ ing and un@@ fu@@ l@@ fil@@ ling ?"
We have this con@@ cept that the op@@ posi@@ te of play is work .
We even feel gu@@ il@@ ty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
"&quot; Oh , my colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es see me l@@ augh@@ ing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hi@@ de because my b@@ os@@ s might see me ."
He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is back@@ war@@ ds .
The op@@ posi@@ te of play is not work . The op@@ posi@@ te of play
is de@@ pres@@ sion . It &apos;s de@@ pres@@ sion .
"In fact , play impro@@ ves our work ."
"J@@ ust like there &apos;s b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts for hum@@ ans and animals , there &apos;s b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts for play at work ."
"For example , it sti@@ mu@@ lat@@ es cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
It incre@@ ases our open@@ ness to change .
It impro@@ ves our ability to learn .
"It provi@@ des a sense of pur@@ pos@@ e and ma@@ st@@ ery — two key moti@@ v@@ ational things that incre@@ ase produ@@ cti@@ vity , through play ."
"So before you start thinking of play as just not seri@@ ous , play doesn &apos;t mean f@@ ri@@ vol@@ ous ."
"You know , the prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal a@@ th@@ le@@ te that lo@@ ves sk@@ i@@ ing , he &apos;s seri@@ ous about it , but he lo@@ ves it ."
"He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the gro@@ o@@ ve , he &apos;s in the f@@ low ."
"A do@@ ctor might be seri@@ ous , but l@@ aughter &apos;s still a great medi@@ cine ."
O@@ ur thinking is back@@ war@@ ds .
We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be feeling gu@@ il@@ ty .
We should be ce@@ le@@ br@@ ating play .
Q@@ u@@ i@@ ck example from the cor@@ por@@ ate world .
"F@@ ed@@ E@@ x , e@@ asy mot@@ to : people , ser@@ vice , prof@@ it ."
"If you tre@@ at your people like people , if you tre@@ at them great , they &apos;re ha@@ p@@ pie@@ r , they &apos;re fu@@ l@@ fil@@ led , they have a sense of ma@@ st@@ ery and pur@@ pos@@ e ."
"What happens ? They give better ser@@ vice — not wor@@ se , but better ."
"And when cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers call for ser@@ vice and they &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with happy people that can make deci@@ sions and are fu@@ l@@ fil@@ led , how do the cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers feel ? They feel great ."
"And what do great cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers do , gre@@ at@@ -@@ feeling cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ?"
"They bu@@ y more of your ser@@ vice and they tell more of their friends , which le@@ ads to more prof@@ it ."
"P@@ e@@ ople , ser@@ vice , prof@@ it ."
"P@@ l@@ ay incre@@ ases produ@@ cti@@ vity , not de@@ cre@@ ases ."
"And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; G@@ e@@ e , that can work for F@@ ed@@ E@@ x out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bu@@ l@@ gar@@ ia ."
"No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in Bu@@ l@@ gar@@ ia , you guys . T@@ wo reas@@ ons ."
"One , play is uni@@ vers@@ al ."
"There &apos;s nothing we@@ ird about Bu@@ l@@ g@@ ari@@ ans that we can &apos;t play , be@@ si@@ des the seri@@ ous me@@ me that we have to ki@@ ck out ."
"T@@ wo , I &apos;ve tr@@ ied it . I &apos;ve tr@@ ied at S@@ ci@@ ant ."
"When I got there , we had zer@@ o happy cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ."
N@@ ot one cu@@ st@@ om@@ er would ref@@ er us .
I asked them all .
We had mar@@ gin@@ al prof@@ it — I did .
"We had mar@@ gin@@ al pro@@ fi@@ ts , and we had un@@ happy st@@ ak@@ e@@ hol@@ ders ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh some basi@@ c change , change like impro@@ ving tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy , change like pro@@ mot@@ ing self-@@ dire@@ ction and col@@ labor@@ ation , en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing col@@ labor@@ ation , not au@@ to@@ c@@ rac@@ y , the things like having a resul@@ t@@ s@@ -@@ fo@@ cus ."
I don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
I care that your cu@@ st@@ om@@ er and your team is happy and you &apos;re organiz@@ ed with that .
Why do I care if you get in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck ?
B@@ a@@ si@@ cally pro@@ mot@@ ing fun .
"Th@@ rou@@ gh pro@@ mot@@ ing fun and a great environment , we were able to trans@@ form S@@ ci@@ ant and , in just three shor@@ t years — sounds like a long time , but change is s@@ low — every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er , from zer@@ o to every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er re@@ fer@@ ring us , ab@@ o@@ ve a@@ ver@@ age pro@@ fi@@ ts for the indu@@ stry and happy st@@ ak@@ e@@ hol@@ ders ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did wi@@ n , every year that we en@@ ter@@ ed , one of the ran@@ k@@ ings for best em@@ plo@@ y@@ er for small business ."
In@@ depen@@ dent an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s from an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es on their sur@@ ve@@ ys .
"It does , and it can , work in Bu@@ l@@ gar@@ ia ."
"There &apos;s nothing hol@@ ding us back , ex@@ cept our own ment@@ ality about play ."
So some ste@@ ps that we can take — to fin@@ is@@ h up — how to make this re@@ v@@ olution through play .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , you have to believe me ."
"If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something ."
"S@@ econ@@ d of all , if you don &apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to re@@ disco@@ ver play ."
"Wh@@ atever it was that as a kid you used to en@@ jo@@ y , that you en@@ jo@@ yed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that pro@@ moti@@ on you can &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y , because you feel like you have to be seri@@ ous , re@@ disco@@ ver it ."
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s m@@ oun@@ tain bi@@ king or re@@ ading a book or playing a g@@ ame .
"R@@ e@@ disco@@ ver that because you &apos;re the le@@ ad@@ ers , the in@@ no@@ vation le@@ ad@@ ers , the thought le@@ ad@@ ers ."
You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the offi@@ ce or talk to your friends and ig@@ ni@@ te the fi@@ re of change in the play re@@ v@@ olution .
"You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es , your em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es , ar@@ en &apos;t going to feel it ."
"You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m going to tr@@ ust you . &quot; &quot; W@@ e@@ ird con@@ cept : I hi@@ red you ; I should tr@@ ust you ."
"I &apos;m going to let you make deci@@ sions . I &apos;m going to em@@ power you , and I &apos;m going to de@@ leg@@ ate to the low@@ est level , rather than the top ."
I &apos;m going to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge con@@ stru@@ ctive cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ sm .
I &apos;m going to let you challen@@ ge au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty .
Because it &apos;s by challen@@ g@@ ing the way things are always done is that we are able to bre@@ ak out of the ru@@ t that we &apos;re in and create in@@ no@@ v@@ ative solu@@ tions to problems of today .
We &apos;re not always right as le@@ ad@@ ers .
We &apos;re going to er@@ ad@@ i@@ cate fe@@ ar .
F@@ e@@ ar is the ene@@ my of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like e@@ li@@ min@@ ate re@@ stri@@ ctions .
"You know what , let them use their mo@@ bi@@ le phone for per@@ s@@ onal cal@@ ls — he@@ a@@ ven for@@ bi@@ d ."
Let them be on the Inter@@ net .
Let them be on in@@ st@@ ant m@@ essen@@ g@@ ers .
Let them take long lu@@ n@@ ch@@ es .
L@@ un@@ ch is like the re@@ cess for work .
"It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you re@@ char@@ ge your brain , you me@@ et your friends , you have a be@@ er , you have some food , you talk , you get some sy@@ ner@@ gy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before ."
"L@@ et them do it . G@@ i@@ ve them some fre@@ e@@ dom , and in gener@@ al , let them play . Let them have fun at the wor@@ k@@ place ."
"We spend so much of our lives at the wor@@ k@@ place , and it &apos;s sup@@ posed to be , what , a mi@@ ser@@ able gr@@ ind , so that 20 years from now , we wa@@ ke up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this it ?"
Is that all there was ? &quot; &quot; U@@ n@@ ac@@ cep@@ table . Ne@@ pr@@ ie@@ m@@ li@@ v .
"( Laughter ) So in sum@@ mar@@ y , we need a dra@@ stic change in the way we think and be@@ have , but we don &apos;t need a wor@@ k@@ ers &apos; re@@ v@@ olution ."
We don &apos;t need a wor@@ k@@ ers &apos; re@@ v@@ olution .
What we need is a pla@@ y@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a pla@@ y@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a pla@@ y@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing .
"S@@ eri@@ ously , we need to b@@ and together . T@@ od@@ ay is the start of the u@@ pri@@ sing . But what you need to do is f@@ an the fl@@ am@@ es of the re@@ v@@ olution . You need to go and share your ideas and your suc@@ cess stor@@ ie@@ s@@ "
"@@ of what worked about re@@ in@@ vi@@ gor@@ ating our lives , our scho@@ ols , and our work with play ; about how play pro@@ mot@@ es a sense of pro@@ mi@@ se and self-@@ fu@@ l@@ fil@@ l@@ ment ; of how play pro@@ mot@@ es in@@ no@@ vation and produ@@ cti@@ vity , and , ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , how play cre@@ ates me@@ an@@ ing ."
"Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can trans@@ form Bu@@ l@@ gar@@ ia for the better ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by of@@ fer@@ ing you a f@@ ree no@@ -@@ te@@ ch life h@@ ack , and all it requi@@ res of you is this : that you change your po@@ stu@@ re for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little aud@@ it of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making your@@ selves s@@ mal@@ ler ?
S@@ ome@@ times we h@@ old on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we sp@@ read out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay at@@ ten@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really fas@@ cin@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly interested in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a smi@@ le , or a con@@ tem@@ p@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a hand@@ sha@@ ke ."
N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New York T@@ im@@ es .
"So obvi@@ ously when we think about n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavi@@ or , or body language — but we call it n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scienti@@ sts — it &apos;s language , so we think about communi@@ cation ."
"When we think about communi@@ cation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a v@@ ali@@ d way to look at this .
And we make s@@ wee@@ ping ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
"And those ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments can pre@@ di@@ ct really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we hi@@ re or pro@@ mot@@ e , who we ask out on a d@@ ate ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ in@@ i Am@@ bad@@ y , a resear@@ ch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts Uni@@ versity , shows that when people wat@@ ch 3@@ 0-@@ second soun@@ d@@ less cli@@ ps of real physi@@ ci@@ an@@ -@@ patien@@ t inter@@ ac@@ tions , their ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the physi@@ ci@@ an &apos;s ni@@ cen@@ ess pre@@ di@@ ct whether or not that physi@@ ci@@ an will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . R@@ ight ?"
"We are also in@@ flu@@ en@@ ced by our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ ghts and our feel@@ ings and our physi@@ o@@ logy ."
So what n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psycho@@ logi@@ st . I study pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , and I te@@ ach at a compe@@ ti@@ tive business school , so it was in@@ evi@@ table that I would become interested in power dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs ."
I became es@@ pe@@ cially interested in n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance .
And what are n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance ?
"So in the ani@@ mal k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about ex@@ pan@@ ding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically open@@ ing up ."
It &apos;s about open@@ ing up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ es@@ si@@ ca T@@ rac@@ y has stud@@ ied ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really powerful with us , we ten@@ d to make ourselves s@@ mal@@ ler . We don &apos;t mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavi@@ or in the clas@@ s@@ room , and what do I noti@@ ce ?"
"When they si@@ t down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ read out ."
"You have other people who are vi@@ r@@ tually col@@ lap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I noti@@ ce a couple of things about this .
So women are much more li@@ ke@@ ly to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ om@@ en feel chro@@ ni@@ cally less powerful than men , so this is not sur@@ pri@@ sing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A clas@@ s@@ room , because parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So business scho@@ ols have been stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ing ."
There &apos;s some evi@@ dence that they do .
"So , for example , we smi@@ le when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ ced to smi@@ le by hol@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ e@@ th like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bod@@ ies , but is it also true that our bod@@ ies change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the powerful ver@@ su@@ s the power@@ less look like ?
"So powerful people ten@@ d to be , not sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ dent , more op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to wi@@ n even at g@@ am@@ es of ch@@ ance .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ri@@ sk@@ s .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to stre@@ ss ."
"So do you want the high-@@ power lea@@ der that &apos;s dom@@ in@@ ant , high on test@@ ost@@ er@@ one , but really stre@@ ss re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"P@@ rob@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this evi@@ dence , both that the body can sha@@ pe the mind , at least at the fac@@ i@@ al level , and also that ro@@ le chang@@ es can sha@@ pe the mind ."
"So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ im@@ al level , like this t@@ iny m@@ ani@@ pul@@ ation , this t@@ iny inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the low@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re tou@@ ching your ne@@ ck , you &apos;re really prote@@ cting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experim@@ ent .
Here &apos;s what we find on test@@ ost@@ er@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these chang@@ es ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
"So it seem@@ s that our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als do gover@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bod@@ ies change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative situ@@ ations , like social thre@@ at situ@@ ations ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recor@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is wor@@ se than being he@@ ck@@ led ."
Pe@@ ople h@@ ate this .
"We then have these c@@ od@@ ers look at these ta@@ p@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis . They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the con@@ di@@ tions .
It &apos;s about the pre@@ sen@@ ce that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ e@@ ch .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the effe@@ ct , or medi@@ ating the effe@@ ct ."
"So I said , fak@@ e it ti@@ ll you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ post@@ or .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad car ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I was th@@ row@@ n out of a car , rol@@ led se@@ ver@@ al times ."
I was th@@ row@@ n from the car .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ied with being s@@ mar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of colle@@ ge , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ is@@ h colle@@ ge ."
I am an im@@ post@@ or .
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feeling ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , she can fak@@ e it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fak@@ e it ti@@ ll you make it ."
F@@ ake it ti@@ ll you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ ali@@ ze .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ iny t@@ we@@ ak@@ s can le@@ ad to big chang@@ es .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ wo minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your test@@ ost@@ er@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
"D@@ on &apos;t leave that situ@@ ation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .

To tem@@ pt us to act differ@@ ently with deli@@ gh@@ t@@ ful cre@@ ative sc@@ ra@@ ps .

A father and d@@ aughter se@@ par@@ ated from a bi@@ cy@@ cle by a m@@ yst@@ eri@@ ous w@@ all .

The woman who as a child had sk@@ i@@ pped with him through fie@@ l@@ ds and bro@@ k@@ en his heart .
"S@@ ure , she had aged a little ."
"In fact , she had aged a lot ."
But he felt all his old pas@@ sion for her re@@ turn .

"R@@ ight ? The brain takes me@@ an@@ in@@ gl@@ ess information and makes me@@ an@@ ing out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was us@@ e@@ ful to see in the past ."
"A@@ ll right ? Wh@@ ich means , when it comes to per@@ cep@@ tion , we &apos;re all like this fro@@ g ."
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s gener@@ ating behavi@@ or that &apos;s us@@ e@@ ful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : O@@ w ! O@@ w ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) B@@ L : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit an@@ no@@ yed , right ?"
"But we &apos;re talking about per@@ cep@@ tion here , right ?"
"And per@@ cep@@ tion under@@ p@@ ins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hop@@ es , our dre@@ am@@ s , the clo@@ the@@ s we we@@ ar , fal@@ ling in love , everything begin@@ s with per@@ cep@@ tion ."
"Now if per@@ cep@@ tion is gro@@ un@@ ded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever respon@@ ding ac@@ cor@@ ding to what we &apos;ve done before ."
"But actually , it &apos;s a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous problem , because how can we ever see differ@@ ently ?"
"Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differ@@ ently , and all new per@@ cep@@ tions beg@@ in in the same way ."
They beg@@ in with a question .
The problem with questions is they create un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"Now , un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ari@@ ly a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a pre@@ d@@ ator , it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
O@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) E@@ ven se@@ a@@ si@@ ck@@ ness is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"R@@ ight ? If you go down be@@ low on a boat , your in@@ ner ear@@ s are you tel@@ ling you you &apos;re moving . Y@@ our eyes , because it &apos;s moving in regi@@ ster with the boat , say I &apos;m standing still ."
"@@ Y@@ our brain cannot deal with the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of that information , and it gets i@@ ll ."
"The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous things you can do , because it takes you into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ."
"And yet , the i@@ ro@@ ny is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to ste@@ p into that space ."
"So how can we ever do anything new ? Well for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , ev@@ olution has given us an answer , right ?"
And it en@@ ab@@ les us to ad@@ dre@@ ss even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . R@@ ight ?
"It &apos;s e@@ asy to ask questions about how did life beg@@ in , or what ex@@ ten@@ ds be@@ y@@ ond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really ste@@ pping into that space ."
So what is ev@@ olution &apos;s answer to the problem of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . E@@ x@@ per@@ ts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
P@@ l@@ ay is one of the only human en@@ de@@ av@@ ors where un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is actually ce@@ le@@ br@@ ated . U@@ n@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is what makes play fun .
"R@@ ight ? It &apos;s ad@@ ap@@ table to change . R@@ ight ? It open@@ s possi@@ bility , and it &apos;s co@@ oper@@ ative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social b@@ on@@ ding , and it &apos;s in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ cally moti@@ v@@ ated . What that means is that we play to play . P@@ l@@ ay is its own re@@ ward ."
"Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the ex@@ act same ways of being you need in order to be a good scienti@@ st ."
S@@ cien@@ ce is not de@@ fin@@ ed by the meth@@ od se@@ ction of a pa@@ per .
"It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is cre@@ ative ."
"So if you ad@@ d ru@@ les to play , you have a g@@ ame ."
That &apos;s actually what an experim@@ ent is .
"So ar@@ med with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experim@@ ents are play , we asked , can any@@ one become a scienti@@ st ?"
And who better to ask than 25 e@@ igh@@ t@@ - to 1@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old children ?
"Because they &apos;re exper@@ ts in play . So I took my be@@ e ar@@ en@@ a down to a small school in D@@ ev@@ on , and the a@@ im of this was to not just get the kids to see science differ@@ ently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differ@@ ently . R@@ ight ?"
The first ste@@ p was to ask a question .
"Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get fun@@ ding for this study because the scienti@@ sts said small children couldn &apos;t make a us@@ e@@ ful con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to science , and the teach@@ ers said kids couldn &apos;t do it ."
So we did it any@@ way . R@@ ight ? O@@ f course .
"So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small pr@@ int so you wouldn &apos;t bo@@ ther re@@ ading it . Po@@ int is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basi@@ s of science publi@@ cation the last five to 15 years . R@@ ight ?"
So they were as@@ king questions that were sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant to exper@@ t scienti@@ sts .
"Now here , I want to share the st@@ age with someone quite spe@@ cial . R@@ ight ?"
"S@@ he was one of the young people who was inv@@ olved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youn@@ gest publi@@ shed scienti@@ sts in the world . R@@ ight ? She will now , once she comes on@@ to st@@ age , will be the youn@@ gest person to ever speak at TED . R@@ ight ?"
"Now , science and as@@ king questions is about cou@@ ra@@ ge ."
"Now she is the per@@ s@@ oni@@ fi@@ cation of cou@@ ra@@ ge , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all ."
"So A@@ my , would you ple@@ ase come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So A@@ my &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton Be@@ es Pro@@ je@@ ct , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go a@@ head , A@@ my ."
"A@@ my O &apos;@@ T@@ o@@ ole : Thank you , Be@@ a@@ u . We thought that it was e@@ asy to see the lin@@ k between hum@@ ans and ap@@ es in the way that we think , because we look ali@@ ke ."
"But we wonder@@ ed if there &apos;s a possible lin@@ k with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if hum@@ ans and bees thought si@@ mi@@ lar , since they se@@ em so different from us ."
So we asked if hum@@ ans and bees might sol@@ ve comple@@ x problems in the same way .
"R@@ e@@ ally , we wanted to know if bees can also ad@@ ap@@ t themselves to new situ@@ ations using pre@@ vi@@ ously learned ru@@ les and con@@ di@@ tions . So what if bees can think like us ?"
"Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an in@@ se@@ ct with only one million brain cells ."
"But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can re@@ cogni@@ ze a good f@@ low@@ er re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the time of day , the light , the we@@ a@@ ther , or from any ang@@ le they appro@@ ach it from . ( Applause ) B@@ L : So the next ste@@ p was to design an experim@@ ent , which is a g@@ ame . So the kids went off and they desig@@ ned this experim@@ ent , and so — well , g@@ ame — and so , A@@ my , can you tell us what the g@@ ame was , and the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le that you set the bees ?"
A@@ O : The pu@@ z@@ z@@ le we came up with was an i@@ f-@@ then ru@@ le .
"We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color f@@ low@@ er only when it &apos;s in a certain pat@@ ter@@ n ."
"They were only re@@ war@@ ded if they went to the y@@ el@@ low f@@ low@@ ers if the y@@ el@@ low f@@ low@@ ers were sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by the blue , or if the blue f@@ low@@ ers were sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by the y@@ el@@ low ."
"Now there &apos;s a number of different ru@@ les the bees can learn to sol@@ ve this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le . The interesting question is , which ?"
"What was really exci@@ ting about this project was we , and Be@@ a@@ u , had no idea whether it would work ."
"It was completely new , and no one had done it before , inclu@@ ding ad@@ ul@@ ts . ( Laughter ) B@@ L : In@@ clu@@ ding the teach@@ ers , and that was really hard for the teach@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s e@@ asy for a scienti@@ st to go in and not have a clu@@ e what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the la@@ b , but for a teach@@ er not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the cre@@ d@@ it goes to D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ wi@@ ck , who was the col@@ labor@@ ator on this project . O@@ kay ?"
"So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next ste@@ p is obser@@ vation . So here are some of the students doing the obser@@ v@@ ations . They &apos;re recor@@ ding the data of where the bees f@@ ly ."
( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ wi@@ ck : So what we &apos;re going to do — S@@ tu@@ dent : 5@@ C .
D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ wi@@ ck : Is she still going up here ? S@@ tu@@ dent : Yeah .
"D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ wi@@ ck : So you keep tr@@ ack of e@@ ach@@ .@@ S@@ tu@@ dent : H@@ en@@ ry , can you help me here ?"
"B@@ L : &quot; &quot; C@@ an you help me , H@@ en@@ ry ? &quot; &quot; What good scienti@@ st says that , right ?"
S@@ tu@@ dent : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
B@@ L : R@@ ight ? So we &apos;ve got our obser@@ v@@ ations . We &apos;ve got our data .
"They do the simple ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs , a@@ ver@@ ag@@ ing , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next ste@@ p .
So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to sub@@ m@@ it this for publi@@ cation . R@@ ight ? So we have to write it up .
"So we go , of course , to the pu@@ b . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is m@@ ine , o@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a pa@@ per has four different se@@ ctions : an in@@ tro@@ du@@ ction , a meth@@ ods , a resul@@ ts , a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
"The in@@ tro@@ du@@ ction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?"
"M@@ e@@ th@@ ods , what did you do ? R@@ es@@ ul@@ ts , what was the obser@@ vation ?"
"And the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion is , who car@@ es ? R@@ ight ?"
"That &apos;s a science pa@@ per , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a nar@@ r@@ ative , which means that this pa@@ per is wri@@ t@@ ten in ki@@ d@@ speak ."
"It &apos;s not wri@@ t@@ ten by me . It &apos;s wri@@ t@@ ten by A@@ my and the other students in the clas@@ s . A@@ s a con@@ sequ@@ ence , this science pa@@ per begin@@ s , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce upo@@ n a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The resul@@ ts se@@ ction , it says : &quot; &quot; T@@ ra@@ ining p@@ ha@@ se , the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le ... du@@ h du@@ h du@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ? ( Laughter ) And the meth@@ ods , it says , &quot; &quot; Th@@ en we put the bees into the f@@ ri@@ dge ( and made be@@ e p@@ ie ) , &quot; &quot; smi@@ ley face . R@@ ight ? ( Laughter ) This is a science pa@@ per . We &apos;re going to try to get it publi@@ shed ."
So here &apos;s the ti@@ tle p@@ age . We have a number of au@@ th@@ ors there .
All the ones in b@@ old are eight to 10 years old .
"The first au@@ th@@ or is B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton P@@ ri@@ mar@@ y S@@ cho@@ ol , because if it were ever re@@ fer@@ en@@ ced , it would be &quot; &quot; B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individu@@ al . So we sub@@ m@@ it it to a public ac@@ cess jour@@ na@@ l , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this ."
"&quot; &quot; I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id the pa@@ per fa@@ il@@ s our ini@@ tial qu@@ ality control che@@ cks in se@@ ver@@ al different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it star@@ ts off &quot; &quot; once upo@@ n a time , &quot; &quot; the figu@@ res are in c@@ ra@@ y@@ on , et@@ c . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it re@@ vie@@ w@@ ed . So I s@@ ent it to D@@ ale P@@ ur@@ ves , who is at the N@@ ational A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of S@@ cien@@ ce , one of the le@@ ading neuro@@ scienti@@ sts in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most ori@@ gin@@ al science pa@@ per I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it cer@@ tain@@ ly des@@ er@@ ves wi@@ de ex@@ pos@@ ure . &quot;"
"L@@ ar@@ ry M@@ al@@ on@@ ey , exper@@ t in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The pa@@ per is mag@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent ."
The work would be publi@@ sha@@ ble if done by ad@@ ul@@ ts . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We sen@@ d it back to the e@@ di@@ tor .
They say no .
"So we asked L@@ ar@@ ry and N@@ at@@ al@@ ie H@@ em@@ pe@@ l to write a com@@ ment@@ ary situ@@ ating the fin@@ dings for scienti@@ sts , right , pu@@ tting in the re@@ fer@@ ences , and we sub@@ m@@ it it to Bi@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters ."
"And there , it was re@@ vie@@ w@@ ed by five in@@ depen@@ dent re@@ fer@@ e@@ es , and it was publi@@ shed . O@@ kay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it publi@@ shed . ( Laughter ) Ty@@ pi@@ cal science , actually , right ? So this makes A@@ my and her friends the youn@@ gest publi@@ shed scienti@@ sts in the world ."
What was the fe@@ ed@@ back like ?
"Well , it was publi@@ shed two days before Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , dow@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed 3@@ 0,000 times in the first day , right ?"
"It was the E@@ di@@ t@@ ors &apos; Ch@@ o@@ ice in S@@ cien@@ ce , which is a top science mag@@ az@@ ine ."
It &apos;s fore@@ ver fre@@ ely ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble by Bi@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters .
It &apos;s the only pa@@ per that will ever be fre@@ ely ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble by this jour@@ na@@ l .
"L@@ ast year , it was the secon@@ d-@@ most dow@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed pa@@ per by Bi@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters , and the fe@@ ed@@ back from not just scienti@@ sts and teach@@ ers but the public as well ."
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; &quot; I have read &apos; B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton Be@@ es &apos; re@@ cent@@ ly . I don &apos;t have words to expla@@ in exactly how I am feeling right now .
"What you guys have done is real , true and amazing ."
"C@@ u@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty , inter@@ est , in@@ no@@ cen@@ ce and ze@@ al are the most basi@@ c and most important things to do science ."
Wh@@ o else can have these qu@@ ali@@ ties more than children ?
P@@ le@@ ase con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to con@@ clu@@ de with a physi@@ cal me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or .
"C@@ an I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , come on . Yeah ye@@ ah . O@@ kay ."
"Now , science is about taking ri@@ sk@@ s , so this is an incredible ri@@ sk , right ? ( Laughter ) F@@ or me , not for him . R@@ ight ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?"
"S@@ hi@@ m@@ on S@@ cho@@ ck@@ en : R@@ ight , but I like myself ."
B@@ L : This is the epi@@ t@@ ome of technology . R@@ ight . O@@ kay .
"Now ... ( Laughter ) O@@ kay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation , right ?"
"You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me c@@ la@@ pping . All right ?"
"( C@@ la@@ pping ) ( C@@ la@@ pping ) O@@ kay , how about if everyone over there sh@@ ou@@ ts . One , two , three ?"
"A@@ ud@@ ience : ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) Bri@@ lli@@ ant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time ."
E@@ very@@ one over there sh@@ out . ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) W@@ here &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
"R@@ ight ? We nor@@ m@@ ally walk through life respon@@ ding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to ste@@ p into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty . When he open@@ ed his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way ."
"That &apos;s what science of@@ f@@ ers us . It of@@ f@@ ers the possi@@ bility to ste@@ p on un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty through the process of play , right ?"
"Now , true science education I think should be about gi@@ ving people a vo@@ ice and en@@ ab@@ ling to ex@@ pre@@ ss that vo@@ ice , so I &apos;ve asked A@@ my to be the last vo@@ ice in this shor@@ t story ."
"So , A@@ my ?"
"A@@ O : This project was really exci@@ ting for me , because it brought the process of disco@@ very to life , and it show@@ ed me that any@@ one , and I mean any@@ one , has the poten@@ tial to disco@@ ver something new , and that a small question can le@@ ad into a big disco@@ very ."
Ch@@ ang@@ ing the way a person thin@@ ks about something can be e@@ asy or hard . It all depen@@ ds on the way the person feel@@ s about change .
"But chang@@ ing the way I thought about science was sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly e@@ asy . O@@ n@@ ce we pla@@ yed the g@@ am@@ es and then started to think about the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a bor@@ ing sub@@ je@@ ct , and that any@@ one can disco@@ ver something new ."
"You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of Be@@ a@@ u , and the B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton Be@@ e Pro@@ je@@ ct ."
Thank y@@ ou@@ .@@ B@@ L : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the bi@@ ggest problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tical En@@ viron@@ ment@@ ali@@ st &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good cho@@ ice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
"And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out p@@ en and pa@@ per because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that ."
So get out your p@@ en and pa@@ per .
"B@@ ot@@ tom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world ."
I &apos;m just going to li@@ st some of them .
There are 8@@ 00 million people star@@ ving .
There &apos;s a billion people without cle@@ an d@@ r@@ in@@ king water .
T@@ wo billion people without s@@ ani@@ tation .
There are se@@ ver@@ al million people dy@@ ing of HIV and AIDS .
The li@@ sts go on and on .
There &apos;s two bi@@ llions of people who will be se@@ ver@@ ely af@@ fe@@ cted by clim@@ ate change — so on .
"There are many , many problems out there ."
"In an ide@@ al world , we would sol@@ ve them all , but we don &apos;t ."
We don &apos;t actually sol@@ ve all problems .
"And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the econom@@ y s@@ es@@ sion — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start as@@ king ourselves , which ones should we sol@@ ve first ?"
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
"If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?"
"We iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ied 10 of the bi@@ ggest challen@@ ges in the world , and I will just br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly read them : clim@@ ate change , communi@@ c@@ able dise@@ ases , con@@ fli@@ cts , education , fin@@ an@@ cial in@@ st@@ ability , govern@@ ance and cor@@ ru@@ ption , mal@@ n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion and hun@@ ger , popul@@ ation mi@@ gr@@ ation , s@@ ani@@ tation and water , and sub@@ si@@ d@@ ies and tra@@ de bar@@ r@@ ier@@ s ."
We believe that these in many ways en@@ comp@@ as@@ s the bi@@ ggest problems in the world .
"The obvi@@ ous question would be to ask , what do you think are the bi@@ ggest things ?"
W@@ here should we start on sol@@ ving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in D@@ av@@ os in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
"But of course , there &apos;s a problem in as@@ king people to fo@@ cus on problems ."
Because we can &apos;t sol@@ ve problems .
Su@@ re@@ ly the bi@@ ggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
"But we don &apos;t have a technology to sol@@ ve that , right ?"
"So the point is not to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze problems , but the point is to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze solu@@ tions to problems ."
And that would be — of course that gets a little more comp@@ lic@@ ated .
To clim@@ ate change that would be like K@@ y@@ oto .
"To communi@@ c@@ able dise@@ ases , it might be health c@@ lini@@ cs or mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to ne@@ ts ."
"To con@@ fli@@ cts , it would be U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s pe@@ ac@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ ping for@@ ces , and so on ."
"The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 secon@@ ds — and I know this is in a sense an im@@ possible t@@ ask — write down what you think is probably some of the top pri@@ or@@ it@@ ies ."
"And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where econ@@ omi@@ cs gets evi@@ l — to put down what are the things we should not do , first ."
What should be at the bot@@ tom of the li@@ st ?
"P@@ le@@ ase , just take 30 secon@@ ds , per@@ haps talk to your neigh@@ b@@ or , and just figure out what should be the top pri@@ or@@ it@@ ies and the bot@@ tom pri@@ or@@ it@@ ies of the solu@@ tions that we have to the world &apos;s bi@@ ggest issu@@ es ."
"The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a sub@@ stan@@ tial amount of my time , right ?"
"I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did ."
"And I also stron@@ g@@ ly en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds , to think about , how do we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze ?"
"O@@ f course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a li@@ st never done before ?"
And one reason is that pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ation is incredi@@ bly un@@ comfor@@ table .
N@@ ob@@ ody wan@@ ts to do this .
"O@@ f course , every organiz@@ ation would love to be on the top of such a li@@ st ."
But every organiz@@ ation would also h@@ ate to be not on the top of the li@@ st .
"And since there are many more not@@ -@@ num@@ ber@@ -@@ one spo@@ ts on the li@@ st than there is number ones , it makes perfe@@ ct sense not to want to do such a li@@ st ."
"We &apos;ve had the U.@@ N@@ . for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundam@@ ent@@ al li@@ st of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?"
"So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ing — any deci@@ sion is a pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ation , so of course we are still pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ing , if only im@@ pli@@ ci@@ tly — and that &apos;s un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly to be as good as if we actually did the pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ation , and went in and tal@@ ked about it ."
"So what I &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situ@@ ation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of cho@@ i@@ ces ."
"There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the pri@@ ces , no@@ r the si@@ z@@ es ."
We have not had an idea .
"I@@ mag@@ ine going into a re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant and getting this big men@@ u car@@ d , but you have no idea what the pri@@ ce is ."
"You know , you have a pi@@ z@@ za ; you &apos;ve no idea what the pri@@ ce is ."
"It could be at one dol@@ lar ; it could be 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"It could be a fam@@ il@@ y@@ -@@ size pi@@ z@@ za ; it could be a very individu@@ al@@ -@@ size pi@@ z@@ za , right ?"
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s is really trying to do — to try to put pri@@ ces on these issu@@ es .
"And so basically , this has been the C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s &apos; process ."
"We got 30 of the world &apos;s best econom@@ ist@@ s , three in each area ."
So we have three of world &apos;s top econom@@ ist@@ s write about clim@@ ate change .
What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the b@@ en@@ ef@@ it of that ?
Li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se in communi@@ c@@ able dise@@ ases .
"Th@@ ree of the world &apos;s top exper@@ ts saying , what can we do ?"
What would be the pri@@ ce ?
"What should we do about it , and what will be the out@@ come ?"
And so on .
"Th@@ en we had some of the world &apos;s top econom@@ ist@@ s , eight of the world &apos;s top econom@@ ist@@ s , inclu@@ ding three N@@ obe@@ l L@@ au@@ re@@ ates , me@@ et in C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en in M@@ ay 200@@ 4 ."
We called them the &quot; &quot; dre@@ am team . &quot; &quot; The C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge Uni@@ versity pre@@ fe@@ cts decided to call them the Re@@ al M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d of econ@@ omi@@ cs .
"That works very well in Europ@@ e , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here ."
And what they basically did was come out with a pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed li@@ st .
"And then you ask , why econom@@ ist@@ s ?"
"And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question ."
"The point is , of course , if you want to know about mal@@ ar@@ ia , you ask a mal@@ ar@@ ia exper@@ t ."
"If you want to know about clim@@ ate , you ask a cli@@ mat@@ ologi@@ st ."
"But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do ."
That is what econom@@ ist@@ s do .
They pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze .
"They make that in some ways dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing t@@ ask of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds ?"
"So this is the li@@ st , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you ."
"O@@ f course , you can also see it on the we@@ b@@ site , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on ."
"They basically came up with a li@@ st where they said there were bad proje@@ cts — basically , proje@@ cts where if you inv@@ est a dol@@ lar , you get less than a dol@@ lar back ."
"Th@@ en there &apos;s fa@@ ir proje@@ cts , good proje@@ cts and very good proje@@ cts ."
"And of course , it &apos;s the very good proje@@ cts we should start doing ."
I &apos;m going to go from back@@ war@@ ds so that we end up with the best proje@@ cts .
These were the bad proje@@ cts .
A@@ s you might see the bot@@ tom of the li@@ st was clim@@ ate change .
"This of@@ f@@ en@@ ds a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t come back , either ."
"And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really cu@@ ri@@ ous ."
Why is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll dis@@ ag@@ ree with on the li@@ st that you wro@@ te down .
The reason why they came up with saying that K@@ y@@ oto — or doing something more than K@@ y@@ oto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very in@@ ef@@ fi@@ cient .
It &apos;s not saying that global war@@ ming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
"But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost ."
"What they basically show us , the a@@ ver@@ age of all m@@ ac@@ ro@@ economic mode@@ ls , is that K@@ y@@ oto , if everyone ag@@ re@@ ed , would cost about 1@@ 50 billion dollars a year ."
That &apos;s a sub@@ stan@@ tial amount of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the global develo@@ pment a@@ id that we give the Th@@ ird World every year .
Y@@ et it would do very little good .
All mode@@ ls show it will post@@ po@@ ne war@@ ming for about six years in 2@@ 100 .
So the guy in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h who gets a flo@@ od in 2@@ 100 can wa@@ it until 2@@ 10@@ 6 .
"Wh@@ ich is a little good , but not very much good ."
"So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good ."
"And just to give you a sense of re@@ fer@@ ence , the U.@@ N@@ . actually est@@ im@@ ate that for half that amount , for about 7@@ 5 billion dollars a year , we could sol@@ ve all major basi@@ c problems in the world ."
"We could give cle@@ an d@@ r@@ in@@ king water , s@@ ani@@ tation , basi@@ c health@@ care and education to every single human being on the planet ."
"So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend t@@ wi@@ ce the amount on doing very little good ?"
O@@ r half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it be@@ comes a bad project .
"It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it ."
"But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first pri@@ ori@@ ty ."
"The fa@@ ir proje@@ cts — noti@@ ce I &apos;m not going to com@@ ment on all these — but communi@@ c@@ able dise@@ ases , scale of basi@@ c health ser@@ vi@@ ces — just made it , simply because , y@@ es , scale of basi@@ c health ser@@ vi@@ ces is a great thing ."
"It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very co@@ st@@ ly ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , what it tel@@ ls us is sud@@ den@@ ly we start thinking about both si@@ des of the equ@@ ation ."
"If you look at the good proje@@ cts , a lot of s@@ ani@@ tation and water proje@@ cts came in ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , s@@ ani@@ tation and water is incredi@@ bly important , but it also co@@ sts a lot of in@@ fra@@ structure ."
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four pri@@ or@@ it@@ ies which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
The f@@ our@@ th best problem is mal@@ ar@@ ia — de@@ al@@ ing with mal@@ ar@@ ia .
The in@@ ci@@ dence of mal@@ ar@@ ia is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get in@@ fe@@ cted every year .
It might even cost up towar@@ ds a per@@ cent@@ age point of G@@ D@@ P every year for af@@ fe@@ cted n@@ ations .
"If we inv@@ est@@ ed about 1@@ 3 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that in@@ ci@@ dence down to half ."
"We could av@@ o@@ id about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 people dy@@ ing , but per@@ haps more import@@ an@@ tly , we could av@@ o@@ id about a &#91; million &#93; people getting in@@ fe@@ cted every year ."
"We would sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ tly incre@@ ase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global war@@ ming ."
This third best one was f@@ ree tra@@ de .
"B@@ a@@ si@@ cally , the model show@@ ed that if we could get f@@ ree tra@@ de , and es@@ pe@@ cially cut sub@@ si@@ d@@ ies in the U.@@ S. and Europ@@ e , we could basically en@@ li@@ ven the global econom@@ y to an ast@@ oun@@ ding number of about 2@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 billion dollars a year , half of which would ac@@ c@@ ru@@ e to the Th@@ ird World ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , the point is to say that we could actually pu@@ ll two to three hundre@@ d million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty , very radi@@ cally f@@ ast , in about two to five years ."
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to fo@@ cus on mal@@ n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion .
"N@@ ot just mal@@ n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion in gener@@ al , but there &apos;s a very che@@ a@@ p way of de@@ al@@ ing with mal@@ n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion , na@@ me@@ ly , the l@@ ack of mi@@ c@@ ron@@ u@@ tr@@ ien@@ ts ."
"B@@ a@@ si@@ cally , about half of the world &apos;s popul@@ ation is l@@ ac@@ king in i@@ ro@@ n , z@@ in@@ c , i@@ od@@ ine and vi@@ tam@@ in A@@ ."
"If we inv@@ est about 12 billion dollars , we could make a se@@ v@@ ere in@@ ro@@ ad into that problem ."
That would be the second best inv@@ est@@ ment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to fo@@ cus on HIV / AIDS .
"B@@ a@@ si@@ cally , if we inv@@ est 2@@ 7 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could av@@ o@@ id 2@@ 8 new million c@@ ases of HIV / AIDS ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , what this does and what it fo@@ c@@ uses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS ."
One is tre@@ at@@ ment ; the other one is pre@@ ven@@ tion .
"And again , in an ide@@ al world , we would do both ."
"But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we inv@@ est first ."
"And tre@@ at@@ ment is much , much more ex@@ pen@@ sive than pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"So basically , what this fo@@ c@@ uses on is saying , we can do a lot more by inv@@ est@@ ing in pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"B@@ a@@ si@@ cally for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in tre@@ at@@ ment , and 10 times as much good in pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"So again , what we fo@@ cus on is pre@@ ven@@ tion rather than tre@@ at@@ ment , at first r@@ ate ."
What this really does is that it makes us think about our pri@@ or@@ it@@ ies .
"I &apos;d like to have you look at your pri@@ ori@@ ty li@@ st and say , did you get it right ?"
O@@ r did you get close to what we came up with here ?
"Well , of course , one of the things is clim@@ ate change again ."
"I find a lot of people find it very , very un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly that we should do that ."
"We should also do clim@@ ate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem ."
"But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems ."
There are many problems out there in the world .
"And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually fo@@ cus on problems , that we fo@@ cus on the right ones ."
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
"And I think , actually — Th@@ om@@ as S@@ ch@@ el@@ ling , one of the parti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts in the dre@@ am team , he put it very , very well ."
"One of things that people for@@ get , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the clim@@ ate change impac@@ ts will be , people will be much , much ri@@ ch@@ er ."
E@@ ven the most p@@ es@@ si@@ mi@@ stic impac@@ t scen@@ ari@@ os of the U.@@ N@@ .
est@@ im@@ ate that the a@@ ver@@ age person in the develo@@ ping world in 2@@ 100 will be about as ri@@ ch as we are today .
"M@@ u@@ ch more li@@ ke@@ ly , they will be two to four times ri@@ ch@@ er than we are ."
"And of course , we &apos;ll be even ri@@ ch@@ er than that ."
"But the point is to say , when we talk about sa@@ ving people , or hel@@ ping people in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a po@@ or B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h@@ i ."
We &apos;re actually talking about a fa@@ ir@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ ut@@ ch guy .
"And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money hel@@ ping a little , 100 years from now , a fa@@ ir@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ ut@@ ch guy ?"
"O@@ r do we want to help real po@@ or people , right now , in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h , who really need the help , and wh@@ om we can help very , very che@@ ap@@ ly ?"
"O@@ r as S@@ ch@@ el@@ ling put it , imagine if you were a ri@@ ch — as you will be — a ri@@ ch Chin@@ ese , a ri@@ ch Bo@@ li@@ vi@@ an , a ri@@ ch Con@@ g@@ ol@@ ese , in 2@@ 100 , thinking back on 200@@ 5 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How od@@ d that they car@@ ed so much about hel@@ ping me a little bit through clim@@ ate change , and car@@ ed so fa@@ ir@@ ly little about hel@@ ping my grand@@ father and my great grand@@ father , wh@@ om they could have hel@@ ped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our pri@@ or@@ it@@ ies stra@@ ight ."
E@@ ven if it doesn &apos;t ac@@ cor@@ d to the ty@@ pi@@ cal way we see this problem .
"O@@ f course , that &apos;s ma@@ in@@ ly because clim@@ ate change has good pi@@ ctures ."
"We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The D@@ ay Af@@ ter T@@ om@@ or@@ row &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?"
"It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I cer@@ tain@@ ly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expe@@ ct E@@ m@@ mer@@ ich to c@@ ast Bra@@ d P@@ it@@ t in his next movie di@@ gg@@ ing lat@@ r@@ ines in T@@ an@@ z@@ ania or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie ."
"So in many ways , I think of the C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s and the whole di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion of pri@@ or@@ it@@ ies as a def@@ en@@ se for bor@@ ing problems ."
To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
"It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media at@@ ten@@ tion , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good ."
"The other obje@@ ctions , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m some@@ how — or we are some@@ how — posi@@ ting a fal@@ se cho@@ ice ."
"O@@ f course , we should do all things , in an ide@@ al world — I would cer@@ tain@@ ly ag@@ ree ."
"I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t ."
"In 19@@ 70 , the develo@@ ped world decided we were going to spend t@@ wi@@ ce as much as we did , right now , than in 19@@ 70 , on the develo@@ ping world ."
S@@ in@@ ce then our a@@ id has hal@@ ved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the pat@@ h of sud@@ den@@ ly sol@@ ving all big problems .
"L@@ i@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , people are also saying , but what about the I@@ ra@@ q war ?"
"You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?"
I &apos;m all for that .
"If any one of you guys can talk B@@ us@@ h into doing that , that &apos;s f@@ ine ."
"But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?"
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right pri@@ or@@ it@@ ies .
"I should just men@@ tion br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly , is this really the right li@@ st that we got out ?"
"You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best econom@@ ist@@ s , you in@@ evi@@ t@@ ably end up as@@ king old , white American men ."
"And they &apos;re not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world ."
So we actually in@@ vi@@ ted 80 young people from all over the world to come and sol@@ ve the same problem .
"The only two requi@@ re@@ ments were that they were stu@@ dy@@ ing at the uni@@ versity , and they spo@@ ke En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ."
"The maj@@ ori@@ ty of them were , first , from develo@@ ping countries ."
"They had all the same materi@@ al but they could go v@@ ast@@ ly outside the sc@@ op@@ e of di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion , and they cer@@ tain@@ ly did , to come up with their own li@@ sts ."
And the sur@@ pri@@ sing thing was that the li@@ st was very si@@ mi@@ lar — with mal@@ n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion and dise@@ ases at the top and clim@@ ate change at the bot@@ tom .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
"There &apos;s been many other se@@ min@@ ars and uni@@ versity students , and different things ."
They all come out with very much the same li@@ st .
"And that gi@@ ves me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a pat@@ h a@@ head to get us to start thinking about pri@@ or@@ it@@ ies , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?"
"O@@ f course , in an ide@@ al world , again we &apos;d love to do everything ."
"But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?"
I see the C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s as a process .
"We did it in 200@@ 4 , and we hope to as@@ se@@ m@@ ble many more people , getting much better information for 200@@ 8 , 20@@ 12 ."
Ma@@ p out the right pat@@ h for the world — but also to start thinking about poli@@ tical tri@@ age .
"To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; A@@ t the end of the day , you can dis@@ ag@@ ree with the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion of how we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze these , but we have to be hon@@ est and f@@ ran@@ k about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do ."
"If we wor@@ ry too much about some things , we end by not wor@@ ry@@ ing about other things ."
"So I hope this will help us make better pri@@ or@@ it@@ ies , and think about how we better work for the world ."
Thank you .
The year is 1@@ 8@@ 00 .
A cu@@ ri@@ ous little inv@@ en@@ tion is being tal@@ ked about .
It &apos;s called a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e .
"I@@ mag@@ ine what happened to the society when they realized that an En@@ g@@ li@@ sh mo@@ m in her te@@ ac@@ up actually was d@@ r@@ in@@ king a mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p , not very far from here . This is from Lon@@ don ."
F@@ ast forward 2@@ 00 years .
"You take a sta@@ in , like ac@@ ri@@ d@@ ine or@@ ange or a flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent sta@@ in or G@@ ie@@ m@@ sa , and a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e , and you look at them ."
They all have fac@@ es .
And that &apos;s pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly because sc@@ al@@ ability of the di@@ ag@@ no@@ sti@@ cs is completely out of re@@ ach .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem l@@ ies with the micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e itself .
"E@@ ven though the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of moder@@ n science , research micro@@ sc@@ op@@ es are not desig@@ ned for fie@@ ld test@@ ing ."
This picture is Ma@@ h@@ at@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i in the &apos; 4@@ 0s using the ex@@ act same se@@ tu@@ p that we actually use today for di@@ ag@@ no@@ sing T@@ .@@ B@@ . in his ash@@ ra@@ m in S@@ ev@@ ag@@ ra@@ m in Indi@@ a .
"T@@ wo of my students , J@@ im and J@@ am@@ es , tra@@ ve@@ led around Indi@@ a and T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , star@@ ting to think about this problem a lot ."
We saw all kinds of d@@ on@@ ated e@@ qui@@ pment .
We saw fun@@ g@@ us grow@@ ing on micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e len@@ ses .
And we saw people who had a fun@@ cti@@ onal micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
What gre@@ w out of that work and that tri@@ p was actually the idea of what we call F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es .
So what is a F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ e ?
"So , now you think , how is that possible ?"
"I &apos;m going to show you some exam@@ ples here , and we will run through some of them ."
It star@@ ts with a single sh@@ e@@ et of pa@@ per .
What you see here is all the possible com@@ pon@@ ents to build a fun@@ cti@@ onal bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ fie@@ ld and flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ence micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e .
"So , there are three st@@ ages : There is the op@@ tical st@@ age , the il@@ lu@@ min@@ ation st@@ age and the mas@@ k@@ -@@ hol@@ ding st@@ age ."
And there are mi@@ c@@ r@@ o op@@ ti@@ cs at the bot@@ tom that &apos;s actually em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the pa@@ per itself .
This pa@@ per has no instru@@ ctions and no langu@@ ages .
"There is a c@@ od@@ e , a color c@@ od@@ e em@@ be@@ d@@ ded , that tel@@ ls you exactly how to f@@ old that speci@@ fic micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e ."
"When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the fun@@ cti@@ on@@ ali@@ ties of a stan@@ d@@ ard micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e , just like an X@@ Y st@@ age , a place where a sam@@ ple sli@@ de could go , for example right here ."
"We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the stan@@ d@@ ard that &apos;s been op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed for over the years , and many health wor@@ k@@ ers are actually used to this ."
You po@@ p this in .
"So what &apos;s really interesting about this obje@@ ct , and my students h@@ ate when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this any@@ way , is these are ru@@ gg@@ ed de@@ vi@@ ces ."
I can turn it on and th@@ row it on the flo@@ or and really try to st@@ om@@ p on it .
And I &apos;m going to pi@@ ck one ran@@ dom@@ ly .
"I have these two micro@@ sc@@ op@@ es that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the w@@ all — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see ."
R@@ ight there .
All from the simple se@@ tu@@ p that I actually descri@@ bed .
So my wi@@ fe has been fie@@ ld test@@ ing some of our micro@@ sc@@ op@@ es by wa@@ sh@@ ing my clo@@ the@@ s wh@@ en@@ ever I for@@ get them in the d@@ ry@@ er .
"So it turns out they &apos;re wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this ."
This also shows you how the proje@@ ction sc@@ op@@ e works .
You get to see the be@@ am the way it &apos;s proje@@ cted and b@@ ent .
C@@ an we get the li@@ ghts back on again ?
"So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m ru@@ n@@ ning out of time , in terms of how much it co@@ sts for us to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture , the bi@@ ggest idea was rol@@ l-@@ to@@ -@@ ro@@ ll man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , so we built this out of 50 c@@ ents of par@@ ts and co@@ sts ."
Here is a sh@@ e@@ et of pa@@ per .
This is when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A@@ 4 sh@@ e@@ et of pa@@ per .
These are the three st@@ ages that you actually see .
So that &apos;s where the len@@ ses go .
There are some light sources .
"So here is another obvi@@ ous thing that we would do , ty@@ pi@@ cally , if I was going to show that these micro@@ sc@@ op@@ es are rob@@ ust , is go to the third flo@@ or and dro@@ p it from the flo@@ or itself ."
"There it is , and it survi@@ ves ."
We are at a st@@ age where we &apos;ll be making thousands of micro@@ sc@@ op@@ es .
"We &apos;ve started colle@@ cting data for mal@@ ar@@ ia , C@@ ha@@ gas dise@@ ase and gi@@ ar@@ di@@ a from patients themselves ."
And I want to leave you with this picture .
"I had not anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed this before , but a really interesting lin@@ k between hand@@ s@@ -@@ on science education and global health ."
What are the to@@ ols that we &apos;re actually provi@@ ding the kids who are going to fi@@ ght this mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p for tom@@ or@@ row ?
I would love for them to be able to just pr@@ int out a F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ e and car@@ ry them around in their po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts .
Thank you .
O@@ ur world has many super@@ her@@ o@@ es .
But they have the wor@@ st of all super@@ pow@@ ers : in@@ visi@@ bility .
"C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are car@@ ts built from wood or me@@ tal and found in se@@ ver@@ al stre@@ ets in B@@ raz@@ il , much like gra@@ f@@ fi@@ t@@ i and stre@@ et art ."
And this is how I first met these mar@@ gin@@ aliz@@ ed super@@ her@@ o@@ es .
"I am a gra@@ f@@ fi@@ t@@ i arti@@ st and acti@@ vi@@ st and my art is social , environ@@ ment@@ al and poli@@ tical in nature ."
"In 200@@ 7 , I took my work be@@ y@@ ond wal@@ ls and on@@ to the car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , as a new urb@@ an sup@@ port for my mess@@ age ."
"But at this time , gi@@ ving vo@@ ice to the cat@@ ad@@ o@@ res ."
"I met them in Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ ina , Chi@@ le , Bo@@ li@@ vi@@ a , S@@ outh Africa , T@@ ur@@ key and even in develo@@ ped countries such as the United States and J@@ ap@@ an ."
And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people jo@@ in the cause because it &apos;s a big challen@@ ge .
( Applause ) .
"But also , they also re@@ cei@@ ve sa@@ fe@@ ty sh@@ ir@@ ts , g@@ lo@@ ves , ra@@ in@@ co@@ ats and e@@ ye@@ gl@@ as@@ ses to see in high-@@ defini@@ tion the city , while their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are ren@@ o@@ v@@ ated by our incredible vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers ."
"And then they re@@ cei@@ ve sa@@ fe@@ ty i@@ tem@@ s , too : ref@@ le@@ ctive ta@@ p@@ es , hor@@ ns and mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r@@ s ."
"Th@@ en , finally , pain@@ ted by a stre@@ et arti@@ st and become part of part of this huge , amazing mo@@ bi@@ le art ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion ."
"But to me@@ et the de@@ m@@ and in other cities , inclu@@ ding outside of B@@ raz@@ il , we have created P@@ im@@ p@@ x , which is inspi@@ red by TE@@ D@@ x , and it &apos;s a sim@@ pli@@ f@@ ied , do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself , c@@ row@@ d@@ fun@@ ded e@@ di@@ tion of P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a ."

"Because of their pi@@ m@@ ped car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , they are able to fi@@ ght back to pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , incre@@ ase their in@@ come and their inter@@ action with society ."
"B@@ el@@ ie@@ ve it or not , there are over 20 million cat@@ ad@@ o@@ res wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
"So next time you see one , re@@ cogni@@ ze them as a vi@@ tal part of our society ."
( Applause ) .
"A@@ b@@ out a year and a half ago , Ste@@ ph@@ en L@@ aw@@ ler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 200@@ 7 on V@@ ir@@ tu@@ al Earth , brought me over to become the archite@@ ct of B@@ ing M@@ ap@@ s , which is Mi@@ cro@@ so@@ ft &apos;s on@@ lin@@ e-@@ ma@@ pping ef@@ for@@ t ."
"In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing the way ma@@ ps work on@@ line ."
And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of ma@@ pping and dire@@ ction site that one is used to .
"So , the first thing that you might noti@@ ce about the ma@@ pping site is just the flu@@ i@@ di@@ ty of the z@@ o@@ om@@ ing and the pan@@ ning , which , if you &apos;re fami@@ li@@ ar at all with Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , that &apos;s where it comes from ."
"M@@ app@@ ing is , of course , not just about car@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ y , it &apos;s also about imag@@ ery ."
"So , as we z@@ o@@ om@@ -@@ in be@@ y@@ ond a certain level this re@@ sol@@ ves into a kind of S@@ im C@@ i@@ ty@@ -@@ like vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al view at 4@@ 5 de@@ gre@@ es ."
"This can be vie@@ w@@ ed from any of the car@@ din@@ al dire@@ ctions to show you the 3@@ D structure of the city , all the fac@@ a@@ des ."

"If you cli@@ ck on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve la@@ un@@ ched ."
"So , for example , a couple of days after the disa@@ ster in Ha@@ it@@ i , we had an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ma@@ p that show@@ ed before and after pi@@ ctures from the sk@@ y ."

These little green bu@@ b@@ b@@ les re@@ present ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ ths that us@@ ers have made .
"I &apos;m not going to di@@ ve into them either , but ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ ths are inte@@ gr@@ ated into the ma@@ p ."
E@@ very@@ thing that &apos;s c@@ as@@ ed in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imag@@ ery on the ground as well .
"And so , when you f@@ ly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you f@@ ly down to the ground , and you see this kind of pan@@ or@@ ami@@ c imag@@ ery , the first thing that you might noti@@ ce is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal under@@ standing of this environment as there is of the thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal city from ab@@ o@@ ve , so if I cli@@ ck on something to get a clo@@ s@@ er view of it , then , the fact that that tran@@ si@@ tion looks as it does , is a fun@@ ction of all of that ge@@ ome@@ try , all of that 3@@ D under@@ standing behind this model ."
"Now , I &apos;ll show you a fun ap@@ p that — we &apos;ve been working on a col@@ labor@@ ation with our friends at F@@ li@@ ck@@ r ."
"This takes F@@ li@@ ck@@ r , ge@@ ore@@ gi@@ ster@@ ed imag@@ ery and uses ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ -@@ like pro@@ cess@@ es to conne@@ ct that imag@@ ery to our imag@@ ery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually me@@ ant to pu@@ ll up , but — ( Laughter ) But noti@@ ce — this is , of course , a popul@@ ar tou@@ ri@@ st site , and there are lots of ph@@ ot@@ os around here , and these ph@@ ot@@ os are all taken at different times ."
So this one was taken around five .
"So that &apos;s the F@@ li@@ ck@@ r ph@@ oto , that &apos;s our imag@@ ery ."
"So you really see how this kind of c@@ row@@ d-@@ sour@@ ced imag@@ ery is inte@@ gr@@ ating , in a very de@@ ep way , into the ma@@ p itself ."
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"There are se@@ ver@@ al reas@@ ons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time tra@@ vel ."
"And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful histor@@ ic imag@@ ery in here , but there are some with hor@@ ses and car@@ ri@@ ages and so on as well ."
"But what &apos;s cool about this is that , not only is it au@@ g@@ ment@@ ing this vi@@ su@@ al re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of the world with things that are coming in from us@@ ers , but it also is the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for au@@ g@@ men@@ ted re@@ ality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be show@@ ing you more of in just a moment ."
Now I just made a tran@@ si@@ tion in@@ do@@ ors . That &apos;s also interesting .
"O@@ K , noti@@ ce there &apos;s now a ro@@ of ab@@ o@@ ve us ."
We &apos;re inside the P@@ i@@ ke P@@ l@@ ace Mar@@ k@@ et .
"And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a back@@ p@@ ack cam@@ era , so , we &apos;re now not only imag@@ ing in the stre@@ et with this cam@@ era on top@@ s of cars , but we &apos;re also imag@@ ing inside ."
"And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sor@@ ts of regi@@ str@@ ation , not only of still images , but also of video ."
"So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , tru@@ ly , very f@@ ri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) OK .
"( R@@ ing@@ ing ) All right , guys , are you there ?"
( N@@ o@@ ise ) All right . I &apos;m hi@@ tting it . I &apos;m pun@@ ching play .
I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
"So , these are our friends in P@@ i@@ ke P@@ l@@ ace Mar@@ k@@ et , the la@@ b ."
( Applause ) So they &apos;re bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st@@ ing this live .
"O@@ K , G@@ e@@ or@@ ge , can you p@@ an back over to the cor@@ ner market ?"
Because I want to show poin@@ ts of inter@@ est .
"No , no . The other way ."
"@@ Yeah , ye@@ ah , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
"O@@ K , OK , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
"O@@ K , never mind ."
"What I wanted to show you was these poin@@ ts of inter@@ est over here on top of the image because what that gi@@ ves you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spo@@ t , you can think about this — this is taking a ste@@ p in ad@@ di@@ tion to au@@ g@@ men@@ ted re@@ ality ."
"What the he@@ ll are you guys — oh , sor@@ ry ."
"( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m h@@ ang@@ ing up now ."
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is to take that real ...
"( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and th@@ ank the team ."
They &apos;ve done a fanta@@ stic job of pul@@ ling this together .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to ab@@ an@@ don them now and walk back outside .
"And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just men@@ tion that here we &apos;re using this for tele@@ pre@@ sen@@ ce , but you can equ@@ ally well use this on the spo@@ t , for au@@ g@@ men@@ ted re@@ ality ."
"When you use it on the spo@@ t , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that me@@ t@@ ad@@ ata and information about the world to you ."
"So here , we &apos;re taking the ex@@ tra ste@@ p of also bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st@@ ing it ."
"That was being bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast , by the way , on a 4@@ G network from the market ."
"A@@ ll right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that Mi@@ cro@@ so@@ ft has given in the past se@@ ver@@ al years ."
"And that &apos;s C@@ ur@@ t@@ is W@@ ong , Wor@@ l@@ d@@ Wi@@ de T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e ."
"So , we &apos;re going to head over to the du@@ m@@ p@@ st@@ ers , where it &apos;s tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal , after a long day at the market , to go out for a bre@@ ak , but also st@@ are up at the sk@@ y ."
This is the inte@@ gr@@ ation of Wor@@ l@@ d@@ Wi@@ de T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e into our ma@@ ps .
"( Applause ) This is the cur@@ r@@ ent — th@@ ank you — this is the cur@@ r@@ ent time . If we sc@@ ru@@ b the time , then we can see how the sk@@ y will look at different times , and we can get all of this very de@@ ta@@ i@@ led information about different times , different d@@ ates : Let &apos;s move the mo@@ on a little high@@ er in the sk@@ y , maybe change the d@@ ate ."
I would like to kind of z@@ o@@ om in on the mo@@ on .
"So , this is an ast@@ ron@@ omi@@ cally comple@@ te re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of the sk@@ y inte@@ gr@@ ated right into the Earth ."
"A@@ ll right now , I &apos;ve over@@ run my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop ."
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
"I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back ."
And let me start with this .
"This is my bas@@ el@@ ine : This is the Me@@ di@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an co@@ ast with no fish , b@@ are ro@@ ck and lots of se@@ a ur@@ ch@@ ins that like to e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
S@@ ome@@ thing like this is what I first saw when I j@@ um@@ ped in the water for the first time in the Me@@ di@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an co@@ ast off S@@ pa@@ in .
"Now , if an al@@ ie@@ n came to ear@@ th — let &apos;s call him Jo@@ e — what would Jo@@ e see ?"
"If Jo@@ e j@@ um@@ ped in a cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f , there are many things the al@@ ie@@ n could see ."
"@@ V@@ ery un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly , Jo@@ e would j@@ um@@ p on a pri@@ st@@ ine cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f , a vi@@ r@@ g@@ in cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f with lots of cor@@ al , sh@@ ar@@ ks , cro@@ c@@ od@@ i@@ les , man@@ ate@@ es , grou@@ per@@ s , tur@@ t@@ les , et@@ c ."
"So , probably , what Jo@@ e would see would be in this part , in the gre@@ eni@@ sh part of the picture ."
"H@@ ere we have the extre@@ me with de@@ ad cor@@ als , mi@@ c@@ robi@@ al s@@ ou@@ p and je@@ l@@ ly@@ fish ."
"And where the di@@ ver is , this is probably where most of the re@@ ef@@ s of the world are now , with very few cor@@ als , al@@ ga@@ e over@@ grow@@ ing the cor@@ als , lots of bac@@ ter@@ ia , and where the large animals are gone ."
And this is what most mar@@ ine scienti@@ sts have seen too .
This is their bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what they think is natural because we started moder@@ n science with s@@ cu@@ ba di@@ ving long after we started de@@ gra@@ ding mar@@ ine e@@ co@@ systems .
"So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time mach@@ ine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like ."
"And let &apos;s start with this time mach@@ ine , the L@@ ine Is@@ l@@ ands , where we have con@@ du@@ cted a ser@@ ies of N@@ ational G@@ e@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c expe@@ di@@ tions ."
"This se@@ a is an archi@@ pe@@ la@@ go be@@ lon@@ g@@ ing to K@@ i@@ ri@@ bat@@ i that sp@@ ans across the equ@@ ator and it has se@@ ver@@ al un@@ in@@ ha@@ bi@@ ted , un@@ fi@@ shed , pri@@ st@@ ine is@@ l@@ ands and a few in@@ ha@@ bi@@ ted is@@ l@@ ands ."
"So let &apos;s start with the first one : Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as Is@@ land , over 5@@ ,000 people ."
"Mo@@ st of the re@@ ef@@ s are de@@ ad , most of the cor@@ als are de@@ ad — over@@ grow@@ n by al@@ ga@@ e — and most of the fish are s@@ mal@@ ler than the pen@@ ci@@ ls we use to coun@@ t them ."
We did 2@@ 50 hours of di@@ ving here in 200@@ 5 .
We didn &apos;t see a single sh@@ ar@@ k .
This is the place that C@@ ap@@ tain C@@ ook disco@@ vered in 1@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7 and he descri@@ bed a huge ab@@ un@@ dance of sh@@ ar@@ ks bi@@ ting the ru@@ dd@@ ers and the o@@ ars of their small bo@@ ats while they were going as@@ hor@@ e .
Let &apos;s move the di@@ al a little bit to the past .
"F@@ an@@ ning Is@@ land , 2@@ ,@@ 500 people ."
The cor@@ als are doing better here . L@@ ots of small fish .
This is what many di@@ ver@@ s would consi@@ der par@@ ad@@ ise .
This is where you can see most of the F@@ l@@ ori@@ da K@@ e@@ ys N@@ ational Mar@@ ine S@@ an@@ ctu@@ ary .
"And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your bas@@ el@@ ine ."
"If we go back to a place like P@@ al@@ my@@ ra At@@ ol@@ l , where I was with J@@ er@@ e@@ my J@@ ac@@ k@@ son a few years ago , the cor@@ als are doing better and there are sh@@ ar@@ ks ."
You can see sh@@ ar@@ ks in every single di@@ ve .
And this is something that is very un@@ usu@@ al in today &apos;s cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s .
"But then , if we shi@@ ft the di@@ al 2@@ 00 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the cor@@ als are absolu@@ tely health@@ y and gor@@ ge@@ ous , form@@ ing spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar stru@@ ctures , and where the pre@@ d@@ at@@ ors are the most con@@ spi@@ cu@@ ous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sh@@ ar@@ ks per di@@ ve ."
What have we learned from these places ?
This is what we thought was natural .
This is what we call the bi@@ om@@ as@@ s py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d .
"If we get all of the fish of a cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f together and we@@ i@@ gh them , this is what we would expe@@ ct ."
"Mo@@ st of the bi@@ om@@ as@@ s is low on the food cha@@ in , the her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , the par@@ ro@@ t@@ fish , the sur@@ ge@@ on@@ fish that e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
"Th@@ en the plan@@ kt@@ on fe@@ ed@@ ers , these little dam@@ sel@@ fish , the little animals flo@@ ating in the water ."
"And then we have a low@@ er bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , and a low@@ er bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of top head , or the sh@@ ar@@ ks , the large s@@ na@@ p@@ per@@ s , the large grou@@ per@@ s ."
But this is a con@@ sequ@@ ence .
This view of the world is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of having stud@@ ied de@@ gra@@ ded re@@ ef@@ s .
"When we went to pri@@ st@@ ine re@@ ef@@ s , we realized that the natural world was up@@ side down ; this py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d was in@@ ver@@ ted ."
"The top head does ac@@ coun@@ t for most of the bi@@ om@@ as@@ s , in some places up to 8@@ 5 percent , like K@@ ing@@ man Re@@ e@@ f , which is now prote@@ cted ."
"The good news is that , in ad@@ di@@ tion to having more pre@@ d@@ at@@ ors , there &apos;s more of everything ."
The size of these bo@@ x@@ es is bi@@ g@@ ger .
"We have more sh@@ ar@@ ks , more bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of s@@ na@@ p@@ per@@ s , more bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , too , like these par@@ ro@@ t fish that are like mar@@ ine go@@ ats ."
"They cle@@ an the re@@ e@@ f ; everything that grow@@ s enough to be seen , they e@@ at , and they keep the re@@ e@@ f cle@@ an and al@@ low the cor@@ als to re@@ pl@@ eni@@ sh ."
"N@@ ot only do these places — these an@@ cient , pri@@ st@@ ine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important com@@ pon@@ ents of the e@@ co@@ system like the gi@@ ant cl@@ am@@ s ; pa@@ v@@ em@@ ents of gi@@ ant cl@@ am@@ s in the la@@ go@@ ons , up to 20 , 25 per squ@@ are me@@ ter ."
"These have disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ared from every in@@ ha@@ bi@@ ted re@@ e@@ f in the world , and they fil@@ ter the water ; they keep the water cle@@ an from micro@@ be@@ s and pa@@ th@@ og@@ ens ."
"But still , now we have global war@@ ming ."
"If we don &apos;t have fi@@ sh@@ ing because these re@@ ef@@ s are prote@@ cted by la@@ w or their re@@ mot@@ en@@ ess , this is great ."
But the water gets war@@ m@@ er for too long and the cor@@ als die .
"So how are these fish , these pre@@ d@@ at@@ ors going to help ?"
"Well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during E@@ l N@@ in@@ o , year &apos; 9@@ 7 , &apos; 9@@ 8 , the water was too war@@ m for too long , and many cor@@ als b@@ le@@ ach@@ ed and many d@@ ied ."
"In Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , where the food we@@ b is really tri@@ m@@ med down , where the large animals are gone , the cor@@ als have not re@@ co@@ vered ."
"In F@@ an@@ ning Is@@ land , the cor@@ als are not re@@ co@@ vered ."
But you see here a big table cor@@ al that d@@ ied and col@@ lap@@ sed .
"And the fish have gra@@ zed the al@@ ga@@ e , so the tur@@ f of al@@ ga@@ e is a little low@@ er ."
"Th@@ en you go to P@@ al@@ my@@ ra At@@ ol@@ l that has more bi@@ om@@ as@@ s of her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , and the de@@ ad cor@@ als are cle@@ an , and the cor@@ als are coming back ."
"And when you go to the pri@@ st@@ ine side , did this ever b@@ le@@ ach ?"
"These places b@@ le@@ ach@@ ed too , but they re@@ co@@ vered f@@ ast@@ er ."
"The more in@@ t@@ act , the more comple@@ te , &#91; and &#93; the more comple@@ x your food we@@ b , the high@@ er the re@@ sil@@ ience , &#91; and &#93; the more li@@ ke@@ ly that the system is going to re@@ co@@ ver from the shor@@ t-@@ ter@@ m impac@@ ts of war@@ ming ev@@ ents ."
"And that &apos;s good news , so we need to re@@ co@@ ver that structure ."
We need to make sure that all of the pie@@ ces of the e@@ co@@ system are there so the e@@ co@@ system can ad@@ ap@@ t to the effe@@ cts of global war@@ ming .
"So if we have to re@@ set the bas@@ el@@ ine , if we have to p@@ us@@ h the e@@ co@@ system back to the left , how can we do it ?"
"Well , there are se@@ ver@@ al ways ."
"One very clear way is the mar@@ ine prote@@ cted are@@ as , es@@ pe@@ cially no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves that we set a@@ side to al@@ low for the re@@ co@@ very for mar@@ ine life ."
And let me go back to that image of the Me@@ di@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an .
This was my bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what I saw when I was a kid .
"And at the same time I was wat@@ ching J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u &apos;s shows on T@@ V , with all this ri@@ ch@@ ness and ab@@ un@@ dance and di@@ versity ."
"And I thought that this ri@@ ch@@ ness be@@ lon@@ g@@ ed to tro@@ pi@@ cal se@@ as , and that the Me@@ di@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an was a natur@@ ally po@@ or se@@ a ."
"But , little did I know , until I j@@ um@@ ped for the first time in a mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve ."
"And this is what I saw , lots of fish ."
"A@@ f@@ ter a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they e@@ at the ur@@ ch@@ ins , and then the al@@ ga@@ e gro@@ w again ."
"So you have this little al@@ g@@ al fore@@ st , and in the size of a lap@@ top you can find more than 100 species of al@@ ga@@ e , mo@@ st@@ ly micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic f@@ it hundre@@ ds of species of little animals that then fe@@ ed the fish , so that the system re@@ co@@ ver@@ s ."
"And this particular place , the Me@@ des Is@@ l@@ ands Mar@@ ine R@@ es@@ er@@ ve , is only 9@@ 4 he@@ ct@@ ar@@ es , and it br@@ ings 6 million e@@ u@@ ro@@ s to the local econom@@ y , 20 times more than fi@@ sh@@ ing , and it re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts 8@@ 8 percent of all the tou@@ ri@@ st re@@ ven@@ ue ."
So these places not only help the e@@ co@@ system but also help the people who can b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from the e@@ co@@ system .
So let me just give you a sum@@ mar@@ y of what no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves do .
"These places , when we prote@@ ct them , if we comp@@ are them to un@@ prote@@ cted are@@ as ne@@ ar@@ by , this is what happens ."
"The number of species incre@@ ases 2@@ 1 percent ; so if you have 1@@ ,000 species you would expe@@ ct 2@@ 00 more in a mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve ."
This is very sub@@ stan@@ tial .
"The size of organi@@ s@@ ms incre@@ ases a third , so your fish are now this big ."
"The ab@@ un@@ dance , how many fish you have per squ@@ are me@@ ter , incre@@ ases almost 1@@ 70 percent ."
"And the bi@@ om@@ as@@ s — this is the most spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar change — 4@@ .@@ 5 times gre@@ ater bi@@ om@@ as@@ s on a@@ ver@@ age , just after five to seven years ."
In some places up to 10 times lar@@ ger bi@@ om@@ as@@ s inside the re@@ ser@@ ves .
"So we have all these things inside the re@@ ser@@ ve that gro@@ w , and what do they do ?"
They re@@ produ@@ ce . That &apos;s popul@@ ation bio@@ logy 10@@ 1 .
"If you don &apos;t ki@@ ll the fish , they take a longer time to die , they gro@@ w lar@@ ger and they re@@ produ@@ ce a lot ."
And same thing for in@@ ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates . This is the example .
"These are e@@ g@@ g c@@ ases la@@ id by a s@@ na@@ il off the co@@ ast of Chi@@ le , and this is how many e@@ g@@ gs they l@@ ay on the bot@@ tom ."
"O@@ ut@@ side the re@@ ser@@ ve , you cannot even de@@ te@@ ct this ."
One point three million e@@ g@@ gs per squ@@ are me@@ ter inside the mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve where these s@@ na@@ il@@ s are very ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant .
"So these organi@@ s@@ ms re@@ produ@@ ce , the little lar@@ v@@ a@@ e ju@@ v@@ eni@@ les spi@@ ll over , they all spi@@ ll over , and then people can b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from them outside too ."
This is in the B@@ a@@ ha@@ m@@ as : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ per .
"H@@ u@@ ge ab@@ un@@ dance of grou@@ per@@ s inside the re@@ ser@@ ve , and the clo@@ s@@ er you get to the re@@ ser@@ ve , the more fish you have ."
So the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men are cat@@ ching more .
You can see where the li@@ mi@@ ts of the re@@ ser@@ ve are because you see the bo@@ ats lin@@ ed up .
"So there is spi@@ ll over ; there are b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts be@@ y@@ ond the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies of these re@@ ser@@ ves that help people around them , while at the same time the re@@ ser@@ ve is prote@@ cting the entire ha@@ bi@@ t@@ at . It is building re@@ sil@@ ience ."
So what we have now — or a world without re@@ ser@@ ves — is like a de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ t where we with@@ dra@@ w all the time and we never make any de@@ pos@@ it .
R@@ es@@ er@@ ves are like sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts .
"We have this prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al that we don &apos;t tou@@ ch ; that produ@@ ces re@@ turns , social , economic and e@@ co@@ logi@@ cal ."
"And if we think about the incre@@ ase of bi@@ om@@ as@@ s inside the re@@ ser@@ ves , this is like com@@ po@@ u@@ nd inter@@ est ."
"T@@ wo exam@@ ples , again , of how these re@@ ser@@ ves can b@@ en@@ ef@@ it people ."
"This is how much fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men get every@@ day in Ken@@ ya , fi@@ sh@@ ing over a ser@@ ies of years , in a place where there is no prote@@ ction ; it &apos;s a fre@@ e-@@ for@@ -@@ all ."
"O@@ n@@ ce the most de@@ gra@@ ding fi@@ sh@@ ing ge@@ ar , se@@ ine ne@@ ts , were re@@ mo@@ ved , the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men were cat@@ ching more ."
"If you fish less , you &apos;re actually cat@@ ching more ."
"But if we ad@@ d the no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ve on top of that , the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men are still making more money by fi@@ sh@@ ing less around an area that is prote@@ cted ."
A@@ no@@ ther example : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ per@@ s in Be@@ li@@ ze in the M@@ es@@ o@@ am@@ eri@@ can Re@@ e@@ f .
"This is grou@@ per se@@ x , and the grou@@ per@@ s ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate around the full mo@@ ons of De@@ c@@ em@@ ber and J@@ an@@ u@@ ary for a week ."
"They used to ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate up to the ten@@ s of thousands , 3@@ 0,000 grou@@ per@@ s about this big in one he@@ ct@@ are , in one ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ation ."
"F@@ i@@ sh@@ er@@ men knew about these things ; they ca@@ u@@ ght them , and they de@@ ple@@ ted them ."
"When I went there for the first time in 2@@ 000 , there were only 3@@ ,000 grou@@ per@@ s left ."
And the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men were au@@ th@@ ori@@ zed to cat@@ ch 30 percent of the entire sp@@ aw@@ ning popul@@ ation every year .
"So we did a simple an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s , and it doesn &apos;t take ro@@ ck@@ et science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fi@@ sh@@ ery is going to col@@ lap@@ se very quickly ."
"And with the fi@@ sh@@ ery , the entire re@@ produ@@ ctive ability of the species goes ex@@ t@@ in@@ ct ."
It happened in many places around the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an .
"And they would make 4@@ ,000 dollars per year , tot@@ al , for the entire fi@@ sh@@ ery , se@@ ver@@ al fi@@ sh@@ ing bo@@ ats ."
"Now , if you do an economic an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 di@@ ver@@ s one mon@@ th per year , the re@@ ven@@ ue would be more than 20 times high@@ er and that would be susta@@ in@@ able over time ."
So how much of this do we have ?
"If this is so good , if this is such a no@@ -@@ bra@@ in@@ er , how much of this do we have ?"
And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean &apos;s prote@@ cted .
"We &apos;re getting clo@@ s@@ er to one percent now , th@@ an@@ ks to the prote@@ ctions of the C@@ ha@@ go@@ s Ar@@ chi@@ pe@@ la@@ go , and only a f@@ rac@@ tion of this is fully prote@@ cted from fi@@ sh@@ ing ."
S@@ cien@@ ti@@ fic stud@@ ies re@@ comm@@ end that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be prote@@ cted .
The est@@ im@@ ated r@@ ange is between 20 and 50 percent for a ser@@ ies of go@@ als of bi@@ od@@ i@@ versity and fi@@ sh@@ ery en@@ h@@ an@@ c@@ ement and re@@ sil@@ ience .
"Now , is this possible ? Pe@@ ople would ask : How much would that cost ?"
"Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are pa@@ ying now to sub@@ si@@ di@@ ze fi@@ sh@@ ing : 3@@ 5 billion dollars per year ."
M@@ any of these sub@@ si@@ d@@ ies go to de@@ stru@@ ctive fi@@ sh@@ ing prac@@ ti@@ ces .
"Well , there are a couple est@@ im@@ ates of how much it would cost to create a network of prote@@ cted are@@ as co@@ ver@@ ing 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a f@@ rac@@ tion of what we are now pa@@ ying ; the government h@@ ands out to a fi@@ sh@@ ery that is col@@ lap@@ sing ."
Pe@@ ople are lo@@ sing their j@@ ob@@ s because the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies are col@@ lap@@ sing .
A cre@@ ation of a network of re@@ ser@@ ves would provi@@ de dire@@ ct em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment for more than a million people p@@ lu@@ s all the secon@@ d@@ ary j@@ ob@@ s and all the secon@@ d@@ ary b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts .
So how can we do that ?
"If it &apos;s so clear that these sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?"
And how can we re@@ ach that go@@ al ?
"Well , there are two ways of getting there ."
The tri@@ vi@@ al solution is to create really large prote@@ cted are@@ as like the C@@ ha@@ go@@ s Ar@@ chi@@ pe@@ la@@ go .
"The problem is that we can create these large re@@ ser@@ ves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social con@@ fli@@ ct , where the poli@@ tical cost is really low and the economic cost is also low ."
"And a few of us , a few organiz@@ ations in this room and el@@ se@@ where are working on this ."
"But what about the rest of the co@@ ast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fi@@ sh@@ ing ?"
"Well , there are three ma@@ in reas@@ ons why we don &apos;t have ten@@ s of thousands of small re@@ ser@@ ves : The first one is that people have no idea what mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ves do , and fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men ten@@ d to be really , really def@@ en@@ sive when it comes to regu@@ lat@@ ing or clo@@ sing an area , even if it &apos;s small ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , the govern@@ ance is not right because most co@@ ast@@ al communi@@ ties around the world don &apos;t have the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty to mon@@ it@@ or the re@@ sources to create the re@@ ser@@ ve and en@@ force it ."
It &apos;s a top down h@@ ier@@ archi@@ cal structure where people wa@@ it for government ag@@ ents to come and this is not effe@@ ctive . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough re@@ sources .
"Wh@@ ich takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more re@@ ser@@ ves , is that the fun@@ ding mode@@ ls have been wrong ."
"N@@ G@@ O@@ s and govern@@ ments spend a lot of time and energy and re@@ sources in a few small are@@ as , usu@@ ally ."
"So mar@@ ine con@@ ser@@ vation and co@@ ast@@ al prote@@ ction has become a sin@@ k for government or ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pi@@ c money , and this is not susta@@ in@@ able ."
So the solu@@ tions are just fi@@ x@@ ing these three issu@@ es .
"F@@ ir@@ st , we need to develo@@ p a global aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to inspi@@ re local communi@@ ties and govern@@ ments to create no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves that are better than what we have now ."
It &apos;s the sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts ver@@ su@@ s the de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ ts with no de@@ pos@@ its .
"S@@ econ@@ d , we need to re@@ design our govern@@ ance so con@@ ser@@ vation ef@@ for@@ ts can be de@@ cen@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed , so con@@ ser@@ vation ef@@ for@@ ts don &apos;t de@@ p@@ end on work from N@@ G@@ O@@ s or from government ag@@ en@@ cies and can be created by the local communi@@ ties , like it happens in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines and a few other places ."
"And third , and very important , we need to develo@@ p new business mode@@ ls ."
The ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ropy sin@@ k as the only way to create re@@ ser@@ ves is not susta@@ in@@ able .
"We really need to develo@@ p mode@@ ls , business mode@@ ls , where co@@ ast@@ al con@@ ser@@ vation is an inv@@ est@@ ment , because we already know that these mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ves provi@@ de social , e@@ co@@ logi@@ cal and economic b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts ."
"And I &apos;d like to fin@@ is@@ h with one thought , which is that no one organiz@@ ation alone is going to sa@@ ve the ocean ."
"There has been a lot of compe@@ ti@@ tion in the past , and we need to develo@@ p a new model of part@@ ner@@ ship , tru@@ ly col@@ labor@@ ative , where we are looking for comple@@ ment@@ ing , not sub@@ stitu@@ ting ."
The st@@ ak@@ es are just too high to contin@@ ue the way we are going .
So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Thank you En@@ ri@@ c .
En@@ ri@@ c S@@ ala : Thank you .
CA : That was a ma@@ ster@@ ful job of pul@@ ling things together .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , your py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d , your in@@ ver@@ ted py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d , show@@ ing 8@@ 5 percent bi@@ om@@ as@@ s in the pre@@ d@@ at@@ ors , that seem@@ s im@@ possible ."
How could 8@@ 5 percent survi@@ ve on 15 percent ?
"E@@ S : Well , imagine that you have two g@@ ear@@ s of a wat@@ ch , a big one and a small one ."
"The big one is moving very s@@ low@@ ly , and the small one is moving f@@ ast ."
That &apos;s basically it .
"The animals at the low@@ er par@@ ts of the food cha@@ in , they re@@ produ@@ ce very f@@ ast ; they gro@@ w really f@@ ast ; they produ@@ ce mi@@ llions of e@@ g@@ gs ."
"U@@ p there , you have sh@@ ar@@ ks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years ."
"They re@@ produ@@ ce very s@@ low@@ ly ; they have a s@@ low me@@ tab@@ o@@ li@@ sm ; and , basically , they just ma@@ in@@ tain their bi@@ om@@ as@@ s ."
"So , basically , the produ@@ ction sur@@ p@@ lu@@ s of these guys down there is enough to ma@@ in@@ tain this bi@@ om@@ as@@ s that is not moving ."
They are like ca@@ pac@@ it@@ ors of the system .
CA : That &apos;s very fas@@ cin@@ ating .
"So , really , our picture of a food py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d is just — we have to change that completely ."
E@@ S : A@@ t least in the se@@ as .
"What we found in cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s is that the in@@ ver@@ ted py@@ ra@@ mi@@ d is the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of the S@@ er@@ en@@ ge@@ t@@ i , with five li@@ ons per wil@@ de@@ be@@ est ."
"And on land , this cannot work ."
But at least on cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s are systems where there is a bot@@ tom com@@ pon@@ ent with structure .
We think this is uni@@ vers@@ al .
But we have started stu@@ dy@@ ing pri@@ st@@ ine re@@ ef@@ s only very re@@ cent@@ ly .
CA : So the num@@ bers you pre@@ sen@@ ted really are ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing .
You &apos;re saying we &apos;re sp@@ ending 3@@ 5 billion dollars now on sub@@ si@@ d@@ ies .
It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as mar@@ ine prote@@ cted are@@ as that actually give new living cho@@ i@@ ces to the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men as well .
"If the world was a s@@ mar@@ ter place , we could sol@@ ve this problem for neg@@ ative 1@@ 9 billion dollars ."
We &apos;ve got 1@@ 9 billion to spend on health care or something .
E@@ S : And then we have the under@@ -@@ perform@@ ance of fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies that is 50 billion dollars .
"So again , one of the big solu@@ tions is have the World T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ gani@@ z@@ ation shi@@ f@@ ting the sub@@ si@@ d@@ ies to susta@@ in@@ able prac@@ ti@@ ces ."
"CA : O@@ kay , so there &apos;s a lot of exam@@ ples that I &apos;m hear@@ ing out there about ending this sub@@ si@@ d@@ ies m@@ ad@@ ness ."
So th@@ ank you for those num@@ bers .
The last one &apos;s a per@@ s@@ onal question .
"A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oce@@ ans for a long time has just been seeing this de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting wor@@ se , de@@ pres@@ sing ."
T@@ al@@ k to me about the feeling that you must have exper@@ ien@@ ced of going to these pri@@ st@@ ine are@@ as and seeing things coming back .
E@@ S : It is a spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al experience .
"We go there to try to understand the e@@ co@@ systems , to try to meas@@ ure or coun@@ t fish and sh@@ ar@@ ks and see how these places are different from the places we know ."
"But the best feeling is this bi@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a that E@@ .@@ O@@ . W@@ il@@ son tal@@ ks about , where hum@@ ans have this sense of a@@ we and won@@ der in front of un@@ tam@@ ed nature , of ra@@ w nature ."
"And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a lar@@ ger thing or of a lar@@ ger global e@@ co@@ system ."
"And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could contin@@ ue doing this job ."
It would be just too de@@ pres@@ sing .
"CA : Well , En@@ ri@@ c , th@@ ank you so much for sh@@ aring some of that spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al experience with us all . Thank you ."
E@@ S : Thank you very much .
"So it &apos;s 199@@ 5 , I &apos;m in colle@@ ge , and a friend and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from Pro@@ vi@@ dence , R@@ h@@ od@@ e Is@@ land to P@@ or@@ t@@ land , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and u@@ ne@@ m@@ plo@@ yed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ ads through state par@@ ks and national fore@@ sts — basically the lon@@ gest rou@@ te we can possi@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the mi@@ ddle of S@@ outh D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 miles ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter I keep seeing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
My friend looks at me tot@@ ally bl@@ an@@ k@@ ly .
There &apos;s actually a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfe@@ ct imi@@ tation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sig@@ ns we keep seeing with the Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few mom@@ ents , and then she c@@ rac@@ ks up , because she figu@@ res out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight , the fam@@ ous Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter for pi@@ c@@ nic area . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situ@@ ations exactly like this — why we sometimes mi@@ su@@ n@@ der@@ stand the sig@@ ns around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ ris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might stri@@ ke you as a str@@ ange car@@ e@@ er move , but it actually has one great adv@@ an@@ t@@ age : no job compe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ o@@ id thinking about being wrong , or at least to av@@ o@@ id thinking about the possi@@ bility that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ strac@@ t .
We all know everybody in this room makes mist@@ ak@@ es .
"The human species , in gener@@ al , is fal@@ li@@ ble — o@@ kay f@@ ine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the belie@@ f@@ s I h@@ old , here in the present ten@@ se , sud@@ den@@ ly all of this ab@@ strac@@ t ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of fal@@ li@@ bility goes out the win@@ do@@ w — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the present ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family vac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and v@@ ot@@ e in the present ten@@ se .
"So effe@@ cti@@ vely , we all kind of wind up tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing through life , tra@@ pped in this little bu@@ b@@ ble of feeling very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individu@@ als , in our per@@ s@@ onal and prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us colle@@ cti@@ vely as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stu@@ ck inside this feeling of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you that it is possible to ste@@ p outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single gre@@ at@@ est mor@@ al , in@@ tel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al and cre@@ ative lea@@ p you can make ."
So why do we get stu@@ ck in this feeling of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emoti@@ on@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ re@@ ad@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ b@@ s down .
"E@@ m@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing . O@@ kay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ re@@ ad@@ ful , th@@ um@@ b@@ s down , em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing — th@@ ank you , these are great ans@@ w@@ ers , but they &apos;re ans@@ w@@ ers to a different question ."
You guys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be de@@ v@@ ast@@ ating , it can be re@@ v@@ el@@ at@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ ny , like my stu@@ pi@@ d Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter mist@@ ake ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an an@@ al@@ og@@ y .
Do you remember that L@@ o@@ ony T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ y@@ ot@@ e who &apos;s always ch@@ as@@ ing and never cat@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ ru@@ n@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every e@@ pis@@ od@@ e of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e is ch@@ as@@ ing the ro@@ ad@@ ru@@ n@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ ru@@ n@@ ner ru@@ ns off a cli@@ ff , which is f@@ ine — he &apos;s a bir@@ d , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e ru@@ ns off the cli@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ ny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e &apos;s tot@@ ally f@@ ine too .
He just ke@@ e@@ ps ru@@ n@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and realiz@@ es that he &apos;s in mi@@ d-@@ air .
That &apos;s when he fal@@ ls .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ot@@ e after he &apos;s gone off the cli@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in t@@ rou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ re@@ ct something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feel@@ s like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a stru@@ ctu@@ ral reason , why we get stu@@ ck inside this feeling of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness .
"Mo@@ st of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ na@@ l cu@@ e to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stu@@ ck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cul@@ tu@@ ral .
Th@@ in@@ k back for a moment to ele@@ ment@@ ary school .
"You &apos;re sitting there in clas@@ s , and your teach@@ er is h@@ an@@ ding back qui@@ z pa@@ per@@ s , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not m@@ ine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this pa@@ per ."
"It &apos;s the du@@ m@@ b kid , the t@@ rou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er , the one who never does his h@@ ome@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ zy , ir@@ respon@@ si@@ ble di@@ m@@ wi@@ ts — and second of all , that the way to suc@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any mist@@ ak@@ es ."
We learn these really bad l@@ ess@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct , es@@ pe@@ cially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just be@@ coming perfe@@ ct little A students , perfe@@ cti@@ on@@ ist@@ s , over@@ -@@ ach@@ ie@@ ver@@ s ."
"R@@ ight , M@@ r. C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ physi@@ ci@@ st , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ physi@@ ci@@ sts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so f@@ ine ."
E@@ x@@ cept that then we fre@@ ak out at the possi@@ bility that we &apos;ve got@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ si@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel s@@ mar@@ t and respon@@ si@@ ble and vi@@ r@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Be@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el De@@ ac@@ on@@ ess Me@@ di@@ cal C@@ enter for a sur@@ g@@ ery ."
Be@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ ost@@ on .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing ho@@ spit@@ al for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"S@@ he &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ zed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ch@@ es her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the re@@ co@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing seem@@ s to have gone f@@ ine .
"And she wa@@ k@@ es up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in b@@ and@@ ages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in b@@ and@@ ages because the sur@@ ge@@ on has perform@@ ed a major oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the vice pre@@ si@@ dent for health care qu@@ ality at Be@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el spo@@ ke about this in@@ ci@@ dent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or whatever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply felt that he was on the cor@@ re@@ ct side of the patien@@ t . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tru@@ st@@ ing too much in the feeling of being on the cor@@ re@@ ct side of anything can be very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ."
This inter@@ na@@ l sense of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a reli@@ able gu@@ i@@ de to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ na@@ l world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ining the possi@@ bility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like du@@ m@@ ping 2@@ 00 million gal@@ l@@ ons of oil into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ exi@@ co , or tor@@ pe@@ doing the global econom@@ y ."
So this is a huge prac@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Th@@ in@@ k for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your belie@@ f@@ s just perfe@@ ct@@ ly ref@@ le@@ ct re@@ ality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to expla@@ in all of those people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us expla@@ in those people the same way , by re@@ sor@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ."
The first thing we usu@@ ally do when someone dis@@ ag@@ re@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ig@@ nor@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have ac@@ cess to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still dis@@ ag@@ ree with us , then we move on to a second as@@ sum@@ ption , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right pie@@ ces of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and they are too mo@@ ro@@ nic to put them together cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty s@@ mar@@ t , then we move on to a third as@@ sum@@ ption : they know the tru@@ th , and they are deli@@ ber@@ ately di@@ stor@@ ting it for their own mal@@ ev@@ ol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ he .
This att@@ ach@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ke@@ e@@ ps us from pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing mist@@ ak@@ es when we absolu@@ tely need to and ca@@ uses us to tre@@ at each other terri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most b@@ af@@ f@@ ling and most tra@@ gi@@ c about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these perfe@@ ct@@ ly trans@@ lu@@ cent win@@ dow@@ s and we just ga@@ ze out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to ga@@ ze out of the same win@@ do@@ w and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The mi@@ rac@@ le of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 2@@ 00 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ tes said his fam@@ ous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St@@ . Au@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , s@@ at down and wro@@ te &quot; &quot; F@@ al@@ lor er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine under@@ sto@@ od that our ca@@ pac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing de@@ fe@@ ct in the human system , something we can er@@ ad@@ i@@ cate or over@@ come ."
It &apos;s tot@@ ally fundam@@ ent@@ al to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other animals , we are ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with trying to figure it out ."
"To me , this ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion is the source and ro@@ ot of all of our produ@@ cti@@ vity and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"L@@ ast year , for v@@ ari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found myself list@@ ening to a lot of epi@@ so@@ des of the P@@ u@@ bli@@ c R@@ ad@@ i@@ o show This American Li@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m list@@ ening and I &apos;m list@@ ening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the c@@ razy w@@ ron@@ g@@ ness l@@ ady .
"I just imag@@ ined it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a ch@@ ance to inter@@ view I@@ ra G@@ las@@ s , who &apos;s the ho@@ st of the show ."
"And I men@@ tion@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ af@@ f , we jo@@ ke that every single e@@ pis@@ od@@ e of our show has the same c@@ ry@@ p@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the c@@ ry@@ p@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra G@@ las@@ s , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mom@@ ents of sur@@ pri@@ se and re@@ vers@@ al and w@@ ron@@ g@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience mem@@ bers , as list@@ en@@ ers , as re@@ ad@@ ers , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot t@@ wi@@ sts and red her@@ r@@ ings and sur@@ pri@@ se en@@ dings .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h thought he was going to inv@@ ade I@@ ra@@ q , find a bu@@ n@@ ch of we@@ apo@@ ns of mas@@ s de@@ stru@@ ction , li@@ ber@@ ate the people and bring de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y to the Mi@@ ddle E@@ ast ."
And something else happened instead .
"And H@@ os@@ ni Mu@@ bar@@ ak thought he was going to be the di@@ ct@@ ator of E@@ g@@ y@@ pt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too si@@ ck and could pas@@ s the re@@ ig@@ ns of power on@@ to his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to gro@@ w up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ wee@@ the@@ art and move back to your h@@ ome@@ tow@@ n and ra@@ ise a bu@@ n@@ ch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredi@@ bly ner@@ dy book about a sub@@ je@@ ct everybody h@@ ates for an audience that would never materi@@ ali@@ ze .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for i@@ ll , we gener@@ ate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ es us ."
"No of@@ f@@ en@@ se , but this entire con@@ fer@@ ence is an un@@ belie@@ v@@ able mon@@ um@@ ent to our ca@@ pac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just spent an entire week talking about in@@ no@@ v@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ c@@ em@@ ents and impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents , but you know why we need all of those in@@ no@@ v@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ c@@ em@@ ents and impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d-@@ bog@@ gl@@ ing and wor@@ l@@ d-@@ alter@@ ing — TED 199@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) D@@ i@@ dn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"W@@ here &apos;s my je@@ t p@@ ack , Ch@@ ris ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We h@@ old another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disco@@ ver won@@ der , you need to ste@@ p outside of that t@@ iny , terri@@ f@@ ied space of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the v@@ ast@@ ness and comple@@ x@@ ity and m@@ yst@@ ery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."

"H@@ ow@@ ever , in every religi@@ on , in every popul@@ ation , you &apos;ll find a small per@@ cent@@ age of people who h@@ old so fer@@ v@@ ently to their belie@@ f@@ s that they feel they must use any means ne@@ cess@@ ary to make others live as they do ."
He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
"That day , the last bu@@ l@@ let I sh@@ ot h@@ it the small or@@ ange light that s@@ at on top of the tar@@ get and to everyone &apos;s sur@@ pri@@ se , es@@ pe@@ cially m@@ ine , the entire tar@@ get bur@@ st into fl@@ am@@ es ."
"They all seem@@ ed to get a really big l@@ au@@ gh out of that com@@ ment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully under@@ sto@@ od what they thought was so fun@@ ny ."
They thought they saw in me the same de@@ stru@@ ction my father was cap@@ able of .
These were the men I looked up to .
"B@@ y the time I turned 1@@ 9 , I had already mo@@ ved 20 times in my life , and that in@@ st@@ ability during my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od didn &apos;t really provi@@ de an opportunity to make many friends ."
"E@@ ach time I would beg@@ in to feel comfor@@ table around someone , it was time to p@@ ack up and move to the next tow@@ n ."
"Be@@ ing the per@@ pe@@ tu@@ al new face in clas@@ s , I was fre@@ qu@@ ently the tar@@ get of bu@@ ll@@ ies ."
"For those reas@@ ons , my social sk@@ il@@ ls were l@@ ac@@ king , to say the least , and grow@@ ing up in a bi@@ got@@ ed hou@@ se@@ h@@ old , I wasn &apos;t pre@@ par@@ ed for the real world ."
"I &apos;d been ra@@ is@@ ed to ju@@ dge people based on ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , like a person &apos;s rac@@ e or religi@@ on ."
So what open@@ ed my eyes ?
"Th@@ rou@@ gh a colle@@ ge pre@@ p program , I was able to take part in the N@@ ational Y@@ outh Con@@ ven@@ tion in P@@ h@@ il@@ a@@ de@@ l@@ phi@@ a ."
The mem@@ bers of our group came from many different wal@@ ks of life .
"A@@ no@@ ther major tur@@ ning point came when I found a sum@@ m@@ er job at B@@ us@@ ch G@@ ar@@ den@@ s , an am@@ us@@ ement par@@ k ."
"There , I was ex@@ posed to people from all sor@@ ts of fai@@ ths and cul@@ tu@@ res , and that experience pro@@ ved to be fundam@@ ent@@ al to the develo@@ pment of my char@@ ac@@ ter ."
"As ch@@ ance would have it , I had the opportunity to work with some of the g@@ ay perform@@ ers at a show there , and so@@ on found that many were the kin@@ d@@ est , least ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment@@ al people I had ever met ."
"Be@@ ing bu@@ l@@ lie@@ d as a kid created a sense of em@@ pa@@ th@@ y in me tow@@ ard the su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing of others , and it comes very un@@ natur@@ ally to me to tre@@ at people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be tre@@ ated ."
"I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be g@@ ay , but I &apos;m well ac@@ qu@@ a@@ in@@ ted with being ju@@ d@@ g@@ ed for something that &apos;s be@@ y@@ ond my control ."
"Th@@ en there was &quot; &quot; The D@@ a@@ i@@ ly S@@ how . &quot; &quot; O@@ n a ni@@ gh@@ tly basi@@ s , J@@ on Ste@@ war@@ t for@@ ced me to be in@@ tel@@ le@@ c@@ tually hon@@ est with myself about my own bi@@ got@@ ry and hel@@ ped me to realize that a person &apos;s rac@@ e , religi@@ on or se@@ x@@ u@@ al or@@ ien@@ tation had nothing to do with the qu@@ ality of one &apos;s char@@ ac@@ ter ."
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in des@@ per@@ ate need of one .
"In that in@@ st@@ ant , I realized how much neg@@ ative energy it takes to h@@ old that h@@ at@@ red inside of you ."
Z@@ ak E@@ bra@@ him is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end our conne@@ ction with my father and start a new life .
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I cho@@ ose to use my experience to fi@@ ght back against ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sm , against the bi@@ got@@ ry ."
"I do it for the vi@@ cti@@ ms of ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sm and their lo@@ ved ones , for the terri@@ ble pa@@ in and lo@@ ss that ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sm has for@@ ced upo@@ n their lives ."
"For the vi@@ cti@@ ms of ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sm , I will speak out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess ac@@ ts and con@@ de@@ m@@ n my father &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"And with that simple fact , I stand here as pro@@ of that violence isn &apos;t in@@ her@@ ent in one &apos;s religi@@ on or rac@@ e , and the son does not have to fol@@ low the ways of his father ."
I am not my father .
"Th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks a lot . ( Applause )"
I &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to be here .
"I &apos;m hon@@ o@@ red by the in@@ vi@@ tation , and th@@ an@@ ks ."
"I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , I s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t inter@@ est many other people ."
"F@@ ir@@ st off , my bad@@ ge says I &apos;m an ast@@ ron@@ om@@ er ."
"I would love to talk about my ast@@ ron@@ om@@ y , but I s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct that the number of people who are interested in radi@@ ative trans@@ f@@ er in n@@ on-@@ gra@@ y atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ es and po@@ lar@@ i@@ z@@ ation of light in Ju@@ pi@@ ter &apos;s u@@ pp@@ er atmo@@ sp@@ here are the number of people who &apos;d f@@ it in a bu@@ s sh@@ el@@ ter ."
So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
"( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 19@@ 8@@ 6 and 19@@ 8@@ 7 , when a computer h@@ ac@@ k@@ er is bre@@ aking into our systems over at L@@ aw@@ r@@ ence B@@ er@@ k@@ ele@@ y L@@ ab@@ s ."
"And I ca@@ u@@ ght the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the S@@ o@@ vie@@ t K@@ G@@ B , and ste@@ al@@ ing information and sel@@ ling it ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be fun — but , 20 years later ..."
"I find computer secu@@ ri@@ ty , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , to be kind of bor@@ ing ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science ."
"The second time , it &apos;s engine@@ ering ."
"A third time , it &apos;s just being a techni@@ ci@@ an ."
"I &apos;m a scienti@@ st . O@@ n@@ ce I do something , I do something else ."
"So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that ."
"N@@ or am I going to talk about what I think are obvi@@ ous stat@@ em@@ ents from my first book , &quot; &quot; S@@ i@@ lic@@ on S@@ na@@ ke O@@ il , &quot; &quot; or my second book , no@@ r am I going to talk about why I believe compu@@ ters don &apos;t be@@ long in scho@@ ols ."
I feel that there &apos;s a mas@@ sive and bi@@ zar@@ re idea going around that we have to bring more compu@@ ters into scho@@ ols .
My idea is : no ! No !
"G@@ et them out of scho@@ ols , and keep them out of scho@@ ols ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent is so obvi@@ ous to any@@ one who &apos;s hun@@ g around a f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de clas@@ s@@ room that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I gu@@ ess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said ."
So don &apos;t go back and read my dis@@ ser@@ tation .
It probably has l@@ ies in it as well .
"H@@ a@@ ving said that , I out@@ lin@@ ed my talk about five minutes ago ."
"( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the ma@@ in thing I wro@@ te on my th@@ um@@ b was the future ."
"I &apos;m sup@@ posed to talk about the future , y@@ es ?"
"O@@ h , right . And my feeling is , as@@ king me to talk about the future is bi@@ zar@@ re , because I &apos;ve got gra@@ y ha@@ ir , and so , it &apos;s kind of sil@@ ly for me to talk about the future ."
"In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologi@@ st , a scienti@@ st , a physi@@ ci@@ st ."
No ! D@@ on &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writing c@@ od@@ e .
"No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teach@@ er ."
They know .
"In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teach@@ er , ask an exper@@ ien@@ ced one ."
They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another gener@@ ation .
"I don &apos;t . N@@ or , I s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring ."
"C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there ."
"But to me , things ar@@ en &apos;t the future ."
"What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ ally good at te@@ xt mess@@ ag@@ ing and spend a huge amount of on-@@ scre@@ en time , but have never gone bow@@ ling together ?"
"Ch@@ ange is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in so@@ f@@ tw@@ are ."
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
"I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?"
Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . R@@ ight over here .
Is that visi@@ ble ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is one@@ -@@ si@@ ded things .
I would de@@ ar@@ ly love to talk about things that have one side .
"Because I love M@@ ob@@ i@@ us lo@@ op@@ s . I not only love M@@ ob@@ i@@ us lo@@ op@@ s , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les ."
"R@@ ight away , I hope that all of your eyes g@@ la@@ ze over ."
This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle .
"For those of you in the audience who know , you ro@@ ll your eyes and say , y@@ up , I know all about it ."
It &apos;s one si@@ ded . It &apos;s a bot@@ tle wh@@ ose inside is its outside .
It has zer@@ o v@@ olu@@ me . And it &apos;s n@@ on-@@ or@@ ien@@ table .
It has wonderful pro@@ per@@ ties .
"If you take two M@@ ob@@ i@@ us lo@@ op@@ s and se@@ w their common ed@@ ge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of gl@@ as@@ s ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : I &apos;ve got a c@@ old . ) H@@ ow@@ ever , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stan@@ ds for design ."
"J@@ ust two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medi@@ um and big K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les for the tra@@ de ."
"But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to show you , first time in public here ."
"This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle w@@ ine bot@@ tle , which , al@@ though in four di@@ men@@ sions it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be able to h@@ old any flu@@ id at all , it &apos;s perfe@@ ct@@ ly cap@@ able of doing so because our universe has only three sp@@ ati@@ al di@@ men@@ sions ."
"And because our universe is only three sp@@ ati@@ al di@@ men@@ sions , it can h@@ old flu@@ i@@ ds ."
So it &apos;s high@@ ly — that one &apos;s the cool one .
That was a mon@@ th of my life .
"But al@@ though I would love to talk about to@@ po@@ logy with you , I &apos;m not going to ."
"( Laughter ) In@@ ste@@ ad , I &apos;m going to men@@ tion my mo@@ m , who pas@@ sed away last sum@@ m@@ er ."
"H@@ ad colle@@ cted photograph@@ s of me , as mo@@ thers will do ."
C@@ ould somebody put this guy up ?
"And I looked over her al@@ bu@@ m and she had colle@@ cted a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 , in front of a bu@@ n@@ ch of di@@ als ."
"And I looked at it , and said , oh my go@@ d , that was me , when I was working at the ele@@ c@@ tro@@ nic music studi@@ o !"

"We &apos;re stu@@ dy@@ ing physi@@ cs , I &apos;m stu@@ dy@@ ing physi@@ cs , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do ."

You won &apos;t need to know tri@@ g .

We &apos;re going to be doing gen@@ u@@ ine physi@@ cs . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
"( H@@ igh@@ -@@ pit@@ ched t@@ one ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my clas@@ s — this is through the len@@ s , and one of the things we used a len@@ s for was to meas@@ ure the speed of light ."
"My students in E@@ l C@@ er@@ ri@@ to — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very be@@ at up os@@ ci@@ l@@ lo@@ sc@@ op@@ e — meas@@ u@@ red the speed of light ."
We were off by 25 percent . How many e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ ders do you know of who have meas@@ u@@ red the speed of light ?
"In ad@@ di@@ tion to that , we &apos;ve meas@@ u@@ red the speed of sound ."
I &apos;d love to meas@@ ure the speed of light here .
"I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; A@@ w man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to im@@ pos@@ e upo@@ n the pow@@ ers that be , and meas@@ ure the speed of light ."
"And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !"
And there &apos;s no time to do it .
"So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll meas@@ ure the speed of light !"
"But me@@ an@@ while , let &apos;s meas@@ ure the speed of sound !"
"Well , the obvi@@ ous way to meas@@ ure the speed of sound is to b@@ oun@@ ce sound off something and look at the ech@@ o ."
"But , probably — one of my students , Ar@@ ie@@ l &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , said , &quot; C@@ ould we meas@@ ure the speed of light using the wa@@ ve equ@@ ation ? &quot;"
And all of you know the wa@@ ve equ@@ ation is the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy times the wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th of any wa@@ ve ...
"@@ is a con@@ st@@ ant . When the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy goes up , the wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th comes down . W@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th goes up , fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy goes down . So , if we have a wa@@ ve here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the pit@@ ch goes up , things get clo@@ s@@ er , pit@@ ch goes down , things stre@@ t@@ ch out ."
R@@ ight ? This is simple physi@@ cs .
"A@@ ll of you know this from e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , remember ?"
"What they didn &apos;t tell you in physi@@ cs — in e@@ igh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ de physi@@ cs — but they should have , and I wi@@ sh they had , was that if you mul@@ ti@@ ply the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy times the wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th of sound or light , you get a con@@ st@@ ant ."
And that con@@ st@@ ant is the speed of sound .
"So , in order to meas@@ ure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy . Well , that &apos;s e@@ asy ."
I &apos;ve got a fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy coun@@ ter right here .
"S@@ et it up to around A , ab@@ o@@ ve A , ab@@ o@@ ve A@@ . There &apos;s an A , more or less ."
"Now , so I know the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy ."
It &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 ki@@ lo@@ her@@ t@@ z . I meas@@ ure its wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th .
"A@@ ll I need now is to fli@@ p on another be@@ am , and the bot@@ tom be@@ am is me talking , right ?"
"So any@@ time I talk , you &apos;d see it on the scre@@ en ."
"I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll noti@@ ce the spi@@ ral ."
"The s@@ lin@@ k@@ y mo@@ ves . We &apos;re going through different no@@ des of the wa@@ ve , coming out this way ."
"Th@@ ose of you who are physi@@ ci@@ sts , I hear you rol@@ ling your eyes , but be@@ ar with me . ( Laughter ) To meas@@ ure the wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th , all I need to do is meas@@ ure the di@@ stance from here — one full wa@@ ve — over to here ."
F@@ ro@@ m here to here is the wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th of sound .
"So , I &apos;ll put a meas@@ ur@@ ing ta@@ pe here , meas@@ ur@@ ing ta@@ pe here , move it back over to here ."
I &apos;ve mo@@ ved the micro@@ phone 20 cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ters .

"O@@ K , let &apos;s go back to M@@ r. E@@ l@@ mo ."
"And we &apos;ll say the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy is 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 ki@@ lo@@ her@@ t@@ z , or 1@@ 7@@ 60 ."

Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 times 0@@ .@@ 2 over here is 3@@ 5@@ 2 me@@ ters per second .

All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
G@@ o back to this picture of me a million years ago .

"I &apos;m as@@ king myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words in@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed upo@@ n the Ha@@ y@@ es H@@ all tow@@ er be@@ l@@ ls : &quot; &quot; All tru@@ th is one ."
"In this light , may science and religi@@ on en@@ de@@ av@@ or here for the ste@@ ady ev@@ olution of man@@ kind , from dar@@ k@@ ness to light , from nar@@ row@@ ness to bro@@ ad@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , from pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce to t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance ."
"It is the vo@@ ice of life , which cal@@ ls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much ."
"A few years ago , I bro@@ ke into my own house ."
"I had just dri@@ ven home , it was around mi@@ dni@@ ght in the de@@ ad of M@@ on@@ tre@@ al win@@ ter , I had been visi@@ ting my friend , J@@ ef@@ f , across tow@@ n , and the ther@@ mom@@ e@@ ter on the front por@@ ch read min@@ us 40 de@@ gre@@ es — and don &apos;t bo@@ ther as@@ king if that &apos;s C@@ el@@ si@@ us or F@@ a@@ h@@ ren@@ he@@ it , min@@ us 40 is where the two sc@@ al@@ es me@@ et — it was very c@@ old ."
"And as I sto@@ od on the front por@@ ch f@@ um@@ b@@ ling in my po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts , I found I didn &apos;t have my ke@@ ys ."
"In fact , I could see them through the win@@ do@@ w , l@@ ying on the din@@ ing room table where I had left them ."
"So I quickly ran around and tr@@ ied all the other do@@ ors and win@@ dow@@ s , and they were lo@@ cked ti@@ ght ."
"I thought about cal@@ ling a lo@@ ck@@ smi@@ th — at least I had my cel@@ l@@ phone , but at mi@@ dni@@ ght , it could take a while for a lo@@ ck@@ smi@@ th to show up , and it was c@@ old ."
"I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend J@@ ef@@ f &apos;s house for the night because I had an early f@@ light to Europ@@ e the next morning , and I needed to get my pas@@ spor@@ t and my su@@ it@@ case ."
"So , des@@ per@@ ate and fre@@ e@@ z@@ ing c@@ old , I found a large ro@@ ck and I bro@@ ke through the bas@@ ement win@@ do@@ w , c@@ lear@@ ed out the sh@@ ar@@ ds of gl@@ as@@ s , I c@@ raw@@ led through , I found a piece of car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard and ta@@ ped it up over the open@@ ing , fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing that in the morning , on the way to the air@@ port , I could call my con@@ trac@@ tor and ask him to fi@@ x it ."
"This was going to be ex@@ pen@@ sive , but probably no more ex@@ pen@@ sive than a mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ night lo@@ ck@@ smi@@ th , so I figu@@ red , under the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces , I was coming out even ."
"Now , I &apos;m a neuro@@ scienti@@ st by tra@@ ining and I know a little bit about how the brain perform@@ s under stre@@ ss ."
"It rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l that ra@@ is@@ es your heart r@@ ate , it mo@@ du@@ lat@@ es ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine le@@ v@@ els and it cl@@ ou@@ ds your thinking ."
"So the next morning , when I wo@@ ke up on too little sle@@ ep , wor@@ ry@@ ing about the ho@@ le in the win@@ do@@ w , and a ment@@ al not@@ e that I had to call my con@@ trac@@ tor , and the fre@@ e@@ z@@ ing temper@@ at@@ ures , and the me@@ et@@ ings I had up@@ coming in Europ@@ e , and , you know , with all the cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l in my brain , my thinking was cl@@ ou@@ dy , but I didn &apos;t know it was cl@@ ou@@ dy because my thinking was cl@@ ou@@ dy ."
"( Laughter ) And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the air@@ port che@@ ck@@ -@@ in coun@@ ter , that I realized I didn &apos;t have my pas@@ spor@@ t . ( Laughter )"
"So I rac@@ ed home in the s@@ now and ice , 40 minutes , got my pas@@ spor@@ t , rac@@ ed back to the air@@ port , I made it just in time , but they had given away my se@@ at to someone else , so I got stu@@ ck in the back of the pl@@ ane , next to the ba@@ th@@ ro@@ oms , in a se@@ at that wouldn &apos;t re@@ c@@ line , on an e@@ igh@@ t-@@ hour f@@ light ."
"Well , I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sle@@ ep ."
"( Laughter ) And I started wonder@@ ing , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will pre@@ v@@ ent bad things from happening ?"
"O@@ r at least if bad things happen , will min@@ imi@@ ze the li@@ ke@@ li@@ ho@@ od of it being a tot@@ al cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ he ."
"So I started thinking about that , but my thou@@ ghts didn &apos;t c@@ r@@ yst@@ al@@ li@@ ze until about a mon@@ th later ."
"I was having din@@ ner with my colle@@ ag@@ ue , D@@ an@@ ny K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man , the N@@ obe@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze win@@ ner , and I some@@ what em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ se@@ d@@ ly told him about having bro@@ k@@ en my win@@ do@@ w , and , you know , for@@ got@@ ten my pas@@ spor@@ t , and D@@ an@@ ny sh@@ ared with me that he &apos;d been prac@@ ti@@ cing something called pro@@ spe@@ ctive h@@ in@@ d@@ si@@ ght ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he had got@@ ten from the psycho@@ logi@@ st G@@ ary K@@ le@@ in , who had wri@@ t@@ ten about it a few years before , also called the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ tem ."
"Now , you all know what the post@@ mor@@ tem is ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever there &apos;s a disa@@ ster , a team of exper@@ ts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?"
"Well , in the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ tem , D@@ an@@ ny expla@@ ined , you look a@@ head and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to pre@@ v@@ ent those things from happening , or to min@@ imi@@ ze the dam@@ age ."
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre@@ -@@ mor@@ tem .
"S@@ ome of them are obvi@@ ous , some of them are not so obvi@@ ous ."
I &apos;ll start with the obvi@@ ous ones .
"A@@ round the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a place for things that are e@@ a@@ si@@ ly lost ."
"Now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our sp@@ ati@@ al memor@@ y works ."
"There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ pu@@ s , that ev@@ olved over ten@@ s of thousands of years , to keep tr@@ ack of the lo@@ c@@ ations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of f@@ ru@@ it tre@@ es , where the frien@@ d@@ ly and ene@@ my tri@@ be@@ s live ."
The hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ pu@@ s is the part of the brain that in Lon@@ don ta@@ x@@ i@@ ca@@ b dri@@ ver@@ s be@@ comes en@@ lar@@ g@@ ed .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allow@@ s squ@@ ir@@ re@@ ls to find their nu@@ ts .
"And if you &apos;re wonder@@ ing , somebody actually did the experim@@ ent where they cut off the ol@@ fac@@ t@@ ory sense of the squ@@ ir@@ re@@ ls , and they could still find their nu@@ ts ."
"They wer@@ en &apos;t using s@@ me@@ ll , they were using the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ pu@@ s , this ex@@ qui@@ si@@ tely ev@@ olved mechani@@ sm in the brain for fin@@ ding things ."
"But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around ."
So this is why we lo@@ se car ke@@ ys and re@@ ading gl@@ as@@ ses and pas@@ spor@@ ts .
"So in the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a spo@@ t for your ke@@ ys — a ho@@ ok by the door , maybe a de@@ cor@@ ative bow@@ l ."
"For your pas@@ spor@@ t , a particular d@@ raw@@ er ."
"For your re@@ ading gl@@ as@@ ses , a particular table ."
"If you desig@@ n@@ ate a spo@@ t and you &apos;re sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them ."
What about tra@@ vel ?
"T@@ ake a cell phone picture of your cre@@ d@@ it car@@ ds , your dri@@ ver &apos;s li@@ cen@@ se , your pas@@ spor@@ t , ma@@ il it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cl@@ ou@@ d ."
"If these things are lost or sto@@ le@@ n , you can fac@@ i@@ lit@@ ate re@@ plac@@ ement ."
Now these are some rather obvi@@ ous things .
"R@@ e@@ member , when you &apos;re under stre@@ ss , the brain rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l ."
"C@@ or@@ ti@@ so@@ l is to@@ x@@ ic , and it ca@@ uses cl@@ ou@@ dy thinking ."
"So part of the prac@@ ti@@ ce of the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ tem is to re@@ cogni@@ ze that under stre@@ ss you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place ."
And there &apos;s per@@ haps no more stre@@ s@@ s@@ ful a situ@@ ation than when you &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with a medi@@ cal deci@@ sion to make .
"And at some point , all of us are going to be in that posi@@ tion , where we have to make a very important deci@@ sion about the future of our medi@@ cal care or that of a lo@@ ved one , to help them with a deci@@ sion ."
And so I want to talk about that .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medi@@ cal con@@ di@@ tion .
"But this stan@@ ds as a pro@@ x@@ y for all kinds of medi@@ cal deci@@ si@@ on-@@ making , and in@@ de@@ ed for fin@@ an@@ cial deci@@ si@@ on-@@ making , and social deci@@ si@@ on-@@ making — any kind of deci@@ sion you have to make that would b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from a r@@ ational as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of the fac@@ ts ."
"So sup@@ pos@@ e you go to your do@@ ctor and the do@@ ctor says , &quot; I just got your la@@ b work back , your cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol &apos;s a little high . &quot;"
"Now , you all know that high cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol is as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated with an incre@@ as@@ ed ri@@ sk of car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cular dise@@ ase , heart att@@ ack , stro@@ ke ."
"And so you &apos;re thinking having high cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol isn &apos;t the best thing , and so the do@@ ctor says , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;d like to give you a dru@@ g that will help you low@@ er your cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol , a stat@@ in . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ve probably heard of stat@@ ins , you know that they &apos;re am@@ ong the most wi@@ de@@ ly pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed dru@@ gs in the world today , you probably even know people who take them ."
"And so you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Yeah ! G@@ i@@ ve me the stat@@ in . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s a question you should ask at this point , a st@@ ati@@ stic you should ask for that most do@@ ct@@ ors don &apos;t like talking about , and ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ tical comp@@ an@@ ies like talking about even less ."
It &apos;s for the number needed to tre@@ at .
"Now , what is this , the N@@ N@@ T ?"
It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a dru@@ g or under@@ go a sur@@ g@@ ery or any medi@@ cal pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re before one person is hel@@ ped .
"And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of c@@ razy st@@ ati@@ stic is that ?"
The number should be one .
My do@@ ctor wouldn &apos;t pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ be something to me if it &apos;s not going to help .
"But actually , medi@@ cal prac@@ ti@@ ce doesn &apos;t work that way ."
"And it &apos;s not the do@@ ctor &apos;s f@@ au@@ l@@ t , if it &apos;s any@@ body &apos;s f@@ au@@ l@@ t , it &apos;s the f@@ au@@ l@@ t of scienti@@ sts like me ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t figu@@ red out the under@@ l@@ ying mechani@@ s@@ ms well enough .
But G@@ la@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mi@@ th@@ K@@ line est@@ im@@ ates that 90 percent of the dru@@ gs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
"So the number needed to tre@@ at for the most wi@@ de@@ ly pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed stat@@ in , what do you sup@@ pos@@ e it is ?"
How many people have to take it before one person is hel@@ ped ?
3@@ 00 .
"This is ac@@ cor@@ ding to research by research prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers J@@ er@@ ome G@@ ro@@ op@@ man and P@@ am@@ el@@ a H@@ ar@@ t@@ z@@ b@@ and , in@@ depen@@ d@@ ently con@@ fir@@ med by B@@ lo@@ om@@ ber@@ g@@ .@@ com@@ ."
I ran through the num@@ bers myself .
"@@ 3@@ 00 people have to take the dru@@ g for a year before one heart att@@ ack , stro@@ ke or other ad@@ verse ev@@ ent is pre@@ ven@@ ted ."
"Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , one in 3@@ 00 ch@@ ance of low@@ ering my cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol ."
"Wh@@ y not , do@@ c ? G@@ i@@ ve me the pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ption any@@ way . &quot; &quot; But you should ask at this point for another st@@ ati@@ stic , and that is , &quot; &quot; T@@ ell me about the side effe@@ cts . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"So for this particular dru@@ g , the side effe@@ cts oc@@ cu@@ r in five percent of the patients ."
"And they inclu@@ de terri@@ ble things — de@@ bi@@ lit@@ ating mus@@ cle and jo@@ int pa@@ in , g@@ ast@@ ro@@ inte@@ st@@ in@@ al di@@ stre@@ ss — but now you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; F@@ i@@ ve percent , not very li@@ ke@@ ly it &apos;s going to happen to me , I &apos;ll still take the dru@@ g . &quot; &quot; But wa@@ it a minu@@ te ."
Re@@ member under stre@@ ss you &apos;re not thinking c@@ lear@@ ly .
"So think about how you &apos;re going to work through this a@@ head of time , so you don &apos;t have to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture the cha@@ in of reas@@ on@@ ing on the spo@@ t ."
"@@ 3@@ 00 people take the dru@@ g , right ? One person &apos;s hel@@ ped , five percent of those 3@@ 00 have side effe@@ cts , that &apos;s 15 people ."
You &apos;re 15 times more li@@ ke@@ ly to be har@@ med by the dru@@ g than you are to be hel@@ ped by the dru@@ g .
"Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the stat@@ in or not ."
I &apos;m just saying you should have this convers@@ ation with your do@@ ctor .
"M@@ e@@ di@@ cal e@@ thi@@ cs requi@@ res it , it &apos;s part of the prin@@ ci@@ ple of inform@@ ed con@@ s@@ ent ."
You have the right to have ac@@ cess to this kind of information to beg@@ in the convers@@ ation about whether you want to take the ri@@ sk@@ s or not .
"Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve pul@@ led this number out of the air for sho@@ ck val@@ ue , but in fact it &apos;s rather ty@@ pi@@ cal , this number needed to tre@@ at ."
"For the most wi@@ de@@ ly perform@@ ed sur@@ g@@ ery on men over the age of 50 , re@@ mov@@ al of the prost@@ ate for can@@ cer , the number needed to tre@@ at is 4@@ 9 ."
"That &apos;s right , 4@@ 9 sur@@ ger@@ ies are done for every one person who &apos;s hel@@ ped ."
And the side effe@@ cts in that case oc@@ cu@@ r in 50 percent of the patients .
"They inclu@@ de im@@ poten@@ ce , er@@ e@@ cti@@ le dy@@ s@@ fun@@ ction , ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence , re@@ ct@@ al te@@ aring , fe@@ cal in@@ contin@@ ence ."
"And if you &apos;re lu@@ ck@@ y , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two ."
So the idea of the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ tem is to think a@@ head of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will p@@ us@@ h the convers@@ ation forward .
You don &apos;t want to have to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture all of this on the spo@@ t .
And you also want to think about things like qu@@ ality of life .
"Because you have a cho@@ ice of@@ ten@@ times , do you I want a shor@@ ter life that &apos;s pain@@ -@@ f@@ ree , or a longer life that might have a great deal of pa@@ in towar@@ ds the end ?"
"These are things to talk about and think about now , with your family and your lo@@ ved ones ."
"You might change your mind in the he@@ at of the moment , but at least you &apos;re prac@@ ti@@ ced with this kind of thinking ."
"R@@ e@@ member , our brain under stre@@ ss rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bu@@ n@@ ch on systems sh@@ u@@ t down ."
There &apos;s an ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary reason for this .
"F@@ ace@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ face with a pre@@ d@@ ator , you don &apos;t need your di@@ g@@ esti@@ ve system , or your li@@ bi@@ do , or your im@@ mu@@ ne system , because if you &apos;re body is ex@@ pen@@ ding me@@ tab@@ o@@ li@@ sm on those things and you don &apos;t re@@ act quickly , you might become the li@@ on &apos;s lu@@ n@@ ch , and then n@@ one of those things matter ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , one of the things that goes out the win@@ do@@ w during those times of stre@@ ss is r@@ ational , logi@@ cal thinking , as D@@ an@@ ny K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man and his colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es have sh@@ own ."
So we need to tra@@ in ourselves to think a@@ head to these kinds of situ@@ ations .
I think the important point here is re@@ cogni@@ z@@ ing that all of us are fl@@ aw@@ ed .
We all are going to fa@@ il now and then .
"The idea is to think a@@ head to what those fai@@ lu@@ res might be , to put systems in place that will help min@@ imi@@ ze the dam@@ age , or to pre@@ v@@ ent the bad things from happening in the first place ."
"G@@ e@@ tting back to that s@@ nowy night in M@@ on@@ tre@@ al , when I got back from my tri@@ p , I had my con@@ trac@@ tor in@@ st@@ all a com@@ bin@@ ation lo@@ ck next to the door , with a key to the front door in it , an e@@ asy to remember com@@ bin@@ ation ."
"And I have to ad@@ m@@ it , I still have pi@@ les of ma@@ il that ha@@ ven &apos;t been sor@@ ted , and pi@@ les of e@@ ma@@ il@@ s that I ha@@ ven &apos;t gone through ."
"So I &apos;m not completely organiz@@ ed , but I see organiz@@ ation as a gra@@ du@@ al process , and I &apos;m getting there ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Go@@ od morning !
A@@ re you a@@ wa@@ ke ?
"They took my name ta@@ g , but I wanted to ask you , did any@@ one here write their name on the ta@@ g in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ?"
"A@@ n@@ y@@ one ! No one ? All right , no problem ."
"O@@ n@@ ce upo@@ n a time , not long ago , I was sitting in a re@@ st@@ au@@ r@@ ant with my friend , or@@ der@@ ing food ."
"So I looked at the wai@@ ter and said , &quot; Do you have a men@@ u ( A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ) ? &quot;"
"He looked at me str@@ ang@@ ely , thinking that he mi@@ sh@@ ear@@ d ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; S@@ or@@ ry ? ( En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The men@@ u ( A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ) , ple@@ ase . &quot; &quot; He re@@ pl@@ ied , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;"
What &apos;s the me@@ an@@ ing of saying &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ?
How could she speak that way ?
"A@@ t that moment , I started thinking ."
It made me ma@@ d .
It defini@@ tely h@@ ur@@ ts !
I &apos;m den@@ ied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
W@@ here could this happen ?
How did we get here ?
"Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would re@@ ach a st@@ age in their lives , where they inv@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ari@@ ly give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re moder@@ n and ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ed ."
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get all my culture , thou@@ ghts , in@@ tel@@ le@@ ct and all my memor@@ ies ?"
Ch@@ il@@ d@@ ho@@ od stories might be the best memor@@ ies we have of the war !
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get everything I learned in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c , just to con@@ form ?"
To be one of them ?
W@@ here &apos;s the logi@@ c in that ?
"D@@ es@@ pi@@ te all that , I tr@@ ied to understand him ."
I didn &apos;t want to ju@@ dge him with the same c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty that he ju@@ d@@ g@@ ed me .
The A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language doesn &apos;t s@@ ati@@ s@@ fy today &apos;s needs .
"It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties , a language we use in the wor@@ k@@ place , a language we re@@ ly on if we were to per@@ form an adv@@ an@@ ced research project , and it defini@@ tely isn &apos;t a language we use at the air@@ port ."
"If we did so , they &apos;d stri@@ p us of our clo@@ the@@ s ."
"W@@ here can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !"
"So , you want us to use A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c . W@@ here are we to do so ?"
This is one re@@ ality .
But we have another more important re@@ ality that we ou@@ ght to think about .
A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c is the mother ton@@ gu@@ e .
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch says that ma@@ st@@ ery of other langu@@ ages de@@ man@@ ds ma@@ st@@ ery of the mother ton@@ gu@@ e .
M@@ ast@@ ery of the mother ton@@ gu@@ e is a pr@@ er@@ e@@ qui@@ site for cre@@ ative ex@@ pres@@ sion in other langu@@ ages .
How ?
"G@@ i@@ bra@@ n K@@ h@@ ali@@ l G@@ i@@ bra@@ n , when he first started writing , he used A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ."
"A@@ ll his ideas , imag@@ in@@ ation and phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y were inspi@@ red by this little bo@@ y in the vi@@ ll@@ age where he gre@@ w up , s@@ me@@ l@@ ling a speci@@ fic s@@ me@@ ll , hear@@ ing a speci@@ fic vo@@ ice , and thinking a speci@@ fic thought ."
"So , when he started writing in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , he had enough b@@ ag@@ g@@ age ."
"E@@ ven when he wro@@ te in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , when you read his wri@@ t@@ ings in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , you s@@ me@@ ll the same s@@ me@@ ll , sense the same feeling ."
"You can imagine that that &apos;s him writing in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , the same bo@@ y who came from the m@@ oun@@ tain . F@@ ro@@ m a vi@@ ll@@ age on M@@ oun@@ t Le@@ ban@@ on ."
"So , this is an example no one can ar@@ gu@@ e with ."
"The G@@ er@@ m@@ ans , F@@ ren@@ ch , J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese and Chin@@ ese , all these n@@ ations are aw@@ are of this ."
That &apos;s why they le@@ gi@@ sl@@ ate to prote@@ ct their language .
They make it s@@ ac@@ red .
"That &apos;s why they use it in produ@@ ction , they pay a lot of money to develo@@ p it ."
Do we know better than them ?
"C@@ oun@@ tries that were once like us , but decided to stri@@ ve for develo@@ pment , do research , and cat@@ ch up with those countries , such as T@@ ur@@ key , M@@ al@@ a@@ ysi@@ a and others , they car@@ ried their language with them as they were clim@@ b@@ ing the l@@ ad@@ der , prote@@ cted it like a di@@ am@@ ond ."
They ke@@ pt it close to them .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local produ@@ ct .
"They &apos;d go back to being con@@ sum@@ ers , clu@@ el@@ ess con@@ sum@@ ers , like we are most of the time ."
"So , in order for them to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate and produ@@ ce , they had to prote@@ ct their language ."
"If I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , in@@ depen@@ dence ( A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ) , &quot; &quot; what does this re@@ mind you of ?"
"It doesn &apos;t ring a be@@ ll , does it ?"
"R@@ e@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the who , how and why ."
"L@@ ang@@ u@@ age isn &apos;t just for con@@ ver@@ sing , just words coming out of our m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"L@@ ang@@ u@@ age re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts speci@@ fic st@@ ages in our lives , and ter@@ min@@ o@@ logy that is lin@@ ked to our emoti@@ ons ."
"L@@ ang@@ u@@ age isn &apos;t one , two or three words or let@@ ters put together ."
"It &apos;s an idea inside that re@@ lat@@ es to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us ."
What is our in@@ tel@@ le@@ ct ?
How do you say whether this guy under@@ stan@@ ds or not ?
"So , if I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , in@@ depen@@ dence ( En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; D@@ ad , have you li@@ ved through the per@@ i@@ od of the fre@@ e@@ dom ( En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ) s@@ log@@ an ? &quot;"
How would you feel ?
"If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in v@@ a@@ in ."
The idea is that these ex@@ pres@@ sions re@@ mind us of a speci@@ fic thing .
I have a f@@ ran@@ cop@@ h@@ one friend who &apos;s mar@@ ried to a F@@ ren@@ ch man .
I asked her once how things were going .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing is f@@ ine , but once , I spent a whole night as@@ king and trying to trans@@ l@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of the word &apos; to@@ q@@ bor@@ ni &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The po@@ or woman had mist@@ ak@@ en@@ ly told him &quot; &quot; to@@ q@@ bor@@ ni , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to expla@@ in it to him ."
He was pu@@ z@@ z@@ led by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could any@@ one be this c@@ ru@@ el ?
D@@ o@@ es she want to comm@@ it su@@ i@@ ci@@ de ?
&apos;@@ Bu@@ ry me ? &apos; ( En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few exam@@ ples .
"It made us feel that she &apos;s u@@ na@@ ble to tell that word to her h@@ us@@ b@@ and , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different ."
"S@@ he said to me , &quot; &quot; He list@@ ens to F@@ a@@ i@@ ru@@ z with me , and one night , I tr@@ ied to trans@@ l@@ ate for him so he can feel what I feel when I list@@ en to F@@ a@@ i@@ ru@@ z . &quot; &quot; The po@@ or woman tr@@ ied to trans@@ l@@ ate this for him : &quot; F@@ ro@@ m them I ex@@ ten@@ ded my h@@ ands and sto@@ le you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pi@@ ck@@ le : &quot; And because you be@@ long to them , I re@@ turned my h@@ ands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )"
T@@ ran@@ sl@@ ate that for me .
"( Applause ) So , what have we done to prote@@ ct the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language ?"
"We turned this into a con@@ cer@@ n of the ci@@ vi@@ l society , and we la@@ un@@ ched a cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to pre@@ ser@@ ve the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language ."
"E@@ ven though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bo@@ ther ?"
F@@ or@@ get about this he@@ ad@@ ac@@ he and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
"The cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to pre@@ ser@@ ve A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c la@@ un@@ ched a s@@ log@@ an that says , &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ ply from the W@@ est . &quot;"
"And when someone tal@@ ks to me that way , I h@@ ate the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language ."
"We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our re@@ ality , and be con@@ v@@ in@@ ced in a way that ref@@ le@@ cts our dre@@ am@@ s , as@@ pi@@ r@@ ations and da@@ y@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day life ."
In a way that dre@@ s@@ ses like us and thin@@ ks like we do .
"So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ ply from the W@@ est &quot; &quot; has h@@ it the spo@@ t ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very e@@ asy , yet cre@@ ative and per@@ su@@ a@@ sive ."
"A@@ f@@ ter that , we la@@ un@@ ched another cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n with scen@@ es of let@@ ters on the ground ."
"You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a scen@@ e of a let@@ ter sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by black and y@@ el@@ low ta@@ pe with &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t ki@@ ll your language ! &quot; &quot; wri@@ t@@ ten on it ."
"Wh@@ y ? S@@ eri@@ ously , don &apos;t ki@@ ll your language ."
We really sh@@ ouldn &apos;t ki@@ ll our language .
"If we were to ki@@ ll the language , we &apos;d have to find an iden@@ ti@@ ty ."
We &apos;d have to find an ex@@ ist@@ ence .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
This is be@@ y@@ ond just mis@@ sing our ch@@ ance of being moder@@ n and ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ed .
Af@@ ter that we rele@@ as@@ ed ph@@ ot@@ os of guys and girls we@@ aring the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c let@@ ter .
P@@ hot@@ os of &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
We are very cool !
"And to wh@@ o@@ ever might say , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ! You used an En@@ g@@ li@@ sh word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I ad@@ op@@ t the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them obje@@ ct h@@ ow@@ ever they want , but give me a word that &apos;s nic@@ er and mat@@ ch@@ es the re@@ ality better ."
I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Inter@@ net &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wi@@ de we@@ b &quot; &quot; ( L@@ augh@@ s ) Because it doesn &apos;t f@@ it ! We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
C@@ re@@ ati@@ vity is the idea .
"A@@ t this moment , every one of you is a cre@@ ative project ."
C@@ re@@ ati@@ vity in your mother ton@@ gu@@ e is the pat@@ h .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
Let &apos;s write a no@@ vel or produ@@ ce a shor@@ t film .
A single no@@ vel could make us global again .
It could bring the A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c language back to being number one .
"So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !"
"But we have to know that , and be con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that a solution ex@@ ist@@ s , that we have a du@@ ty to be part of that solution ."
"In con@@ clu@@ sion , what can you do today ?"
"P@@ le@@ ase , I be@@ g of you , even though my time has fini@@ shed , either A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c , En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , F@@ ren@@ ch or Chin@@ ese ."
But don &apos;t write A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c with L@@ at@@ in char@@ ac@@ ters mi@@ x@@ ed with num@@ bers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a disa@@ ster ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be en@@ ter@@ ing a vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al world with a vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al language .
It &apos;s not e@@ asy to come back from such a place and ri@@ se .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
"S@@ econ@@ d , there are many other things that we can do ."
We &apos;re not here today to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce each other .
We &apos;re here to bring at@@ ten@@ tion to the ne@@ ces@@ sity of pre@@ ser@@ ving this language .
Now I will tell you a se@@ cre@@ t .
"S@@ u@@ sta@@ in@@ ability re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts the what , the where and the how of what is ca@@ u@@ ght ."
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my din@@ ner cho@@ i@@ ces .
I want to know how I impac@@ t them .
I want to know how they impac@@ t me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they re@@ ly on the water &apos;s b@@ oun@@ ty for their living .
U@@ n@@ der@@ standing all of this en@@ ab@@ les us to shi@@ ft our per@@ cep@@ tion of se@@ a@@ food away from a com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty to an opportunity to re@@ stor@@ e our e@@ co@@ system .
It allow@@ s for us to ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate the se@@ a@@ food that we &apos;re also so for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate to e@@ at .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ a@@ food .
"W@@ here susta@@ in@@ ability is the ca@@ pac@@ ity to en@@ du@@ re and ma@@ in@@ tain , re@@ stor@@ ative is the ability to re@@ pl@@ eni@@ sh and pro@@ gre@@ ss ."
"R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ a@@ food allow@@ s for an ev@@ ol@@ ving and dy@@ na@@ mi@@ c system and ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ ges our relation@@ ship with the ocean as a re@@ source , su@@ gg@@ est@@ ing that we eng@@ age to re@@ pl@@ eni@@ sh the ocean and to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge its re@@ sil@@ ien@@ cy ."
"It is a more hop@@ e@@ ful , it is a more human , and is a more us@@ e@@ ful way of under@@ standing our environment ."
W@@ al@@ let gu@@ ide@@ s — stan@@ d@@ ard issue by lots in the mar@@ ine con@@ ser@@ vation world — are very h@@ an@@ dy ; they &apos;re a wonderful to@@ ol .
"G@@ re@@ en , y@@ el@@ low and red li@@ sts &#91; of &#93; se@@ a@@ food species ."
"The as@@ so@@ ci@@ ation is very e@@ asy : bu@@ y green , don &apos;t bu@@ y red , think t@@ wi@@ ce about y@@ el@@ low ."
"But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just e@@ at green li@@ st ."
We can &apos;t susta@@ in this without the meas@@ ure of our suc@@ cess really chang@@ ing the f@@ ate of the species in the y@@ el@@ low and the red .
But what if we e@@ at only in the green li@@ st ?
You &apos;ve got po@@ le@@ -@@ ca@@ u@@ ght y@@ el@@ low@@ f@@ in tu@@ na here — comes from susta@@ in@@ able sto@@ cks .
Po@@ le ca@@ u@@ ght — no by@@ cat@@ ch .
Gre@@ at for fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men . L@@ ots of money . S@@ up@@ por@@ ting local econom@@ ies .
But it &apos;s a li@@ on of the se@@ a . It &apos;s a top pre@@ d@@ ator .
What &apos;s the con@@ te@@ xt of this me@@ al ?
A@@ m I sitting down in a ste@@ ak@@ house to a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of this ?
Do I do this three times a week ?
"I might still be in the green li@@ st , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oce@@ ans any fa@@ v@@ ors ."
"The point is that we have to have a con@@ te@@ xt , a g@@ au@@ ge for our ac@@ tions in all this ."
E@@ x@@ am@@ ple : I &apos;ve heard that red w@@ ine is great for my health — anti@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ dan@@ ts and min@@ er@@ als — heart health@@ y .
That &apos;s great ! I love red w@@ ine !
I &apos;m going to d@@ r@@ in@@ k so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so health@@ y .
"Well , how many bot@@ t@@ les is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?"
"Well fol@@ ks , we have a prote@@ in problem ."
"We have lost this sen@@ si@@ bility when it re@@ gar@@ ds our food , and we are pa@@ ying a cost ."
The problem is we are hi@@ ding that cost b@@ ene@@ ath the wa@@ ves .
We are hi@@ ding that cost behind the social ac@@ cep@@ t@@ ance of ex@@ pan@@ ding wa@@ ist@@ lin@@ es .
And we are hi@@ ding that cost behind mon@@ ster pro@@ fi@@ ts .
So the first thing about this idea of re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ a@@ food is that it really takes into ac@@ coun@@ t our needs .
"R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ a@@ food might best be re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted not by J@@ aw@@ s , or by F@@ li@@ pp@@ er , or the G@@ or@@ don &apos;s fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man , but rather , by the J@@ ol@@ ly Gre@@ en G@@ i@@ ant ."
V@@ e@@ ge@@ tab@@ les : they might yet sa@@ ve the oce@@ ans .
Sy@@ l@@ vi@@ a li@@ k@@ es to say that blue is the new green .
Well I &apos;d like to re@@ spe@@ ct@@ fully sub@@ m@@ it that bro@@ c@@ col@@ i green might then be the new blue .
"We must contin@@ ue to e@@ at the best se@@ a@@ food possible , if at all ."
But we also must e@@ at it with a ton of ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les .
The best part about re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ a@@ food though is that it comes on the hal@@ f-@@ sh@@ ell with a bot@@ tle of T@@ ab@@ as@@ co and le@@ m@@ on we@@ d@@ ges .
"It comes in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a bre@@ ad@@ ed with D@@ i@@ j@@ on mu@@ star@@ d and cri@@ sp@@ y , bro@@ i@@ led bre@@ ad@@ c@@ ru@@ m@@ b@@ s and a ste@@ am@@ ing pi@@ le of pe@@ can qu@@ in@@ o@@ a pi@@ la@@ f with c@@ ru@@ n@@ chy , g@@ ri@@ l@@ led bro@@ c@@ col@@ i so so@@ ft and s@@ we@@ et and char@@ red and smo@@ k@@ y on the outside with just a h@@ int of chi@@ li fl@@ ake ."
Wh@@ o@@ o@@ o !
This is an e@@ asy se@@ ll .
And the best part is all of those in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ ts are available to every family at the neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od W@@ al@@ mar@@ t .
J@@ am@@ ie O@@ li@@ ver is cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ning to sa@@ ve America from the way we e@@ at .
Sy@@ l@@ vi@@ a is cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ning to sa@@ ve the oce@@ ans from the way we e@@ at .
There &apos;s a pat@@ ter@@ n here .
F@@ or@@ get nuclear ho@@ lo@@ ca@@ ust ; it &apos;s the for@@ k that we have to wor@@ ry about .
We have ra@@ v@@ aged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sour@@ ced to h@@ an@@ di@@ ca@@ p ourselves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole e@@ ating thing wrong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expe@@ ct from our food .
Su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability is comp@@ lic@@ ated but din@@ ner is a re@@ ality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of movement re@@ cent@@ ly in gre@@ ening our food systems .
D@@ an Bar@@ ber and A@@ li@@ ce W@@ at@@ ers are le@@ ading pas@@ si@@ on@@ ately the green food De@@ li@@ ci@@ ous R@@ ev@@ olution .
But green fo@@ ods often re@@ present a way for us to dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard the respon@@ si@@ bility as e@@ at@@ ers .
J@@ ust because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can tre@@ at it with dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard on the pl@@ ate .
We have e@@ co@@ -@@ frien@@ d@@ ly sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any e@@ co@@ -@@ frien@@ d@@ ly al@@ l-@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ e@@ at sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p bu@@ f@@ f@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t work .
H@@ ear@@ t-@@ health@@ y din@@ ner is a very important part of re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ a@@ food .
"W@@ hi@@ le we try to man@@ age dec@@ lin@@ ing mar@@ ine popul@@ ations , the media &apos;s re@@ com@@ men@@ ding incre@@ as@@ ed con@@ sum@@ ption of se@@ a@@ food ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ies say that ten@@ s of thousands of American grand@@ mo@@ thers , grand@@ fa@@ thers , mo@@ thers and fa@@ thers might be around for another bir@@ th@@ day if we inclu@@ ded more se@@ a@@ food ."
That &apos;s a re@@ ward I am not wil@@ ling to pas@@ s up .
But it &apos;s not all about the se@@ a@@ food .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our pl@@ ates .
"As a che@@ f , I realize the e@@ as@@ ie@@ st thing for me to do is redu@@ ce the por@@ tion si@@ z@@ es on my pl@@ ate ."
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
"P@@ e@@ ople started bu@@ ying ap@@ pe@@ ti@@ z@@ ers and s@@ al@@ ads , because they knew they wer@@ en &apos;t going to fi@@ ll up on the ent@@ re@@ es alone ."
"P@@ e@@ ople spent more time eng@@ ag@@ ing in their me@@ als , eng@@ ag@@ ing with each other over their me@@ als ."
"P@@ e@@ ople got , in shor@@ t , more of what they came there for even though they got less prote@@ in ."
They got more cal@@ or@@ ies over the course of a di@@ ver@@ si@@ f@@ ied me@@ al .
They got health@@ ier . I made more money .
This is great .
"E@@ n@@ viron@@ ment@@ al consi@@ der@@ ation was ser@@ ved with every pl@@ ate , but it was ser@@ ved with a he@@ ap@@ ing m@@ ound of consi@@ der@@ ation for human interest@@ s at the same time ."
"One of the other things we did was beg@@ in to di@@ ver@@ si@@ fy the species that we ser@@ ved — small sil@@ ver@@ fish , an@@ cho@@ v@@ ies , m@@ ac@@ k@@ er@@ el , s@@ ar@@ din@@ es were un@@ common ."
"S@@ hel@@ l@@ fish , mus@@ sel@@ s , o@@ yst@@ ers , cl@@ am@@ s , ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a , ch@@ ar — these were the common species ."
"We were dire@@ cting ta@@ st@@ es towar@@ ds more re@@ sil@@ ience , more re@@ stor@@ ative op@@ tions ."
This is what we need to fa@@ v@@ or .
This is what the green li@@ st says .
But this is also how we can actually beg@@ in to re@@ stor@@ e our environment .
"But what of those big pre@@ d@@ at@@ ors , those fas@@ hi@@ on@@ able species , that green li@@ st tu@@ na that I was talking about ear@@ lie@@ r ?"
"Well , if you must , I have a re@@ ci@@ pe for you ."
"It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go ."
St@@ art with a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of big fish .
G@@ et a k@@ ni@@ fe . C@@ u@@ t it into four por@@ tions .
P@@ u@@ t it on four pl@@ ates .
"M@@ ound up those four pl@@ ates with ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les and then open up the very best bot@@ tle of Bu@@ r@@ g@@ un@@ dy you have , light the c@@ and@@ les and ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate it ."
C@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the opportunity you have to e@@ at this .
"In@@ vi@@ te your friends and neigh@@ b@@ ors over and re@@ pe@@ at once a year , maybe ."
I expe@@ ct a lot from food .
I expe@@ ct health and jo@@ y and family and community .
"I expe@@ ct that produ@@ cing in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ ts , pre@@ par@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es and e@@ ating me@@ als is all part of the communi@@ on of human interest@@ s ."
I was lu@@ ck@@ y enough that my father was a fanta@@ stic co@@ ok .
And he t@@ au@@ ght me very early on about the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge that e@@ ating re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts .
I remember well the me@@ als of my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od .
"They were reas@@ on@@ able por@@ tions of prote@@ in ser@@ ved with cop@@ i@@ ous qu@@ anti@@ ties of ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les and small amoun@@ ts of star@@ ch , usu@@ ally ri@@ ce ."
This is still how I lar@@ ge@@ ly e@@ at today .
I get si@@ ck when I go to ste@@ ak@@ h@@ ous@@ es .
I get the me@@ at s@@ we@@ ats .
It &apos;s like a h@@ an@@ go@@ ver from prote@@ in .
It &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing .
"But of all the di@@ re news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oce@@ ans , I have the un@@ for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate bur@@ den of deli@@ ver@@ ing to you possi@@ bly the very wor@@ st of it and that is this whole time your mother was right ."
E@@ at your ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les .
It &apos;s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward .
So what are we looking for in a me@@ al ?
"Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome in@@ gre@@ d@@ ien@@ ts that are good for my body ."
"For jo@@ y , I &apos;m looking for bu@@ t@@ ter and s@@ al@@ t and se@@ x@@ y things that make things ta@@ ste less like pen@@ ance ."
"For family , I &apos;m looking for re@@ ci@@ p@@ es that gen@@ u@@ f@@ le@@ ct to my own per@@ s@@ onal histor@@ ies ."
"For community though , we start at the very beginning ."
There &apos;s no es@@ ca@@ ping the fact that everything we e@@ at has a global impac@@ t .
So try and learn as best you can what that impac@@ t is and then take the first ste@@ p to min@@ imi@@ ze it .
"We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world b@@ ank ."
But it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our re@@ sources ; it &apos;s also the global ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y of the communi@@ on we call din@@ ner .
"So if we all take only what we need , then we can beg@@ in to share the rest , we can beg@@ in to ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate , we can beg@@ in to re@@ stor@@ e ."
We need to sa@@ v@@ or ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les .
We need to sa@@ v@@ or s@@ mal@@ ler por@@ tions of se@@ a@@ food .
And we need to sa@@ ve din@@ ner .
Thank you .
( Applause )
H@@ i . I am an archite@@ ct .
"I am the only archite@@ ct in the world making buil@@ dings out of pa@@ per like this car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard tu@@ be , and this ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion is the first one I did using pa@@ per tu@@ be@@ s ."
"@@ 19@@ 8@@ 6 , much , much longer before people started talking about e@@ co@@ logi@@ cal issu@@ es and environ@@ ment@@ al issu@@ es , I just started test@@ ing the pa@@ per tu@@ be in order to use this as a building structure ."
"It &apos;s very comp@@ lic@@ ated to test the new materi@@ al for the building , but this is much stron@@ ger than I expe@@ cted , and also it &apos;s very e@@ asy to wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and also , because it &apos;s indu@@ stri@@ al materi@@ al , it &apos;s also possible to fi@@ re@@ pro@@ of ."
"Th@@ en I built the tem@@ por@@ ary structure , 199@@ 0 ."
This is the first tem@@ por@@ ary building made out of pa@@ per .
"There are 3@@ 30 tu@@ be@@ s , di@@ am@@ e@@ ter 5@@ 5 &#91; cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ters &#93; , there are only 12 tu@@ be@@ s with a di@@ am@@ e@@ ter of 1@@ 20 cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ters , or four fe@@ et , wi@@ de ."
"As you see it in the ph@@ oto , inside is the to@@ i@@ let ."
"In case you &apos;re fini@@ shed with to@@ i@@ let pa@@ per , you can te@@ ar off the inside of the w@@ all . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very us@@ e@@ ful ."
"@@ Ye@@ ar 2@@ 000 , there was a big ex@@ po in G@@ er@@ many ."
"I was asked to design the building , because the the@@ me of the ex@@ po was environ@@ ment@@ al issu@@ es ."
"So I was cho@@ s@@ en to build the pa@@ vi@@ li@@ on out of pa@@ per tu@@ be@@ s , re@@ cy@@ cl@@ able pa@@ per ."
My go@@ al of the design is not when it &apos;s comple@@ ted .
"My go@@ al was when the building was demo@@ li@@ shed , because each country makes a lot of pa@@ vi@@ li@@ ons but after half a year , we create a lot of indu@@ stri@@ al wa@@ ste , so my building has to be re@@ used or re@@ cy@@ c@@ led ."
"A@@ f@@ ter , the building was re@@ cy@@ c@@ led ."
So that was the go@@ al of my design .
Th@@ en I was very lu@@ ck@@ y to wi@@ n the compe@@ ti@@ tion to build the second P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ enter in Fran@@ ce in the city of M@@ et@@ z .
"Because I was so po@@ or , I wanted to r@@ ent an offi@@ ce in Par@@ is , but I couldn &apos;t af@@ for@@ d it , so I decided to bring my students to Par@@ is to build our offi@@ ce on top of the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ enter in Par@@ is by ourselves ."
So we brought the pa@@ per tu@@ be@@ s and the wo@@ o@@ den jo@@ in@@ ts to comple@@ te the 3@@ 5@@ -@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ long offi@@ ce .
We sta@@ yed there for six years without pa@@ ying any r@@ ent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
"Because we were part of the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to bu@@ y a ti@@ ck@@ et to see me ."
That was the problem .
Th@@ en I comple@@ ted the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ enter in M@@ et@@ z .
"It &apos;s a very popul@@ ar mus@@ e@@ um now , and I created a big mon@@ um@@ ent for the government ."
"But then I was very disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ted at my prof@@ es@@ sion as an archite@@ ct , because we are not hel@@ ping , we are not working for society , but we are working for pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed people , ri@@ ch people , government , develo@@ per@@ s ."
They have money and power .
Th@@ ose are in@@ visi@@ ble .
So they hi@@ re us to vi@@ su@@ ali@@ ze their power and money by making mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al archite@@ cture .
"That is our prof@@ es@@ sion , even histori@@ cally it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same ."
"So I was very disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ted that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their h@@ ous@@ es by natural disa@@ st@@ ers ."
But I must say they are no longer natural disa@@ st@@ ers .
"For example , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es never ki@@ ll people , but col@@ lap@@ se of the buil@@ dings ki@@ ll people ."
That &apos;s the respon@@ si@@ bility of archite@@ cts .
"Th@@ en people need some tem@@ por@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing , but there are no archite@@ cts working there because we are too bus@@ y working for pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed people ."
"So I thought , even as archite@@ cts , we can be inv@@ olved in the re@@ con@@ stru@@ ction of tem@@ por@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing ."
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in disa@@ ster are@@ as .
"@@ 199@@ 4 , there was a big disa@@ ster in R@@ wan@@ da , Africa ."
"T@@ wo tri@@ be@@ s , H@@ u@@ tu and T@@ ut@@ si , f@@ ou@@ ght each other ."
O@@ ver two million people became re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
"But I was so sur@@ pri@@ sed to see the sh@@ el@@ ter , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p organiz@@ ed by the U.@@ N@@ ."
"They &apos;re so po@@ or , and they are fre@@ e@@ z@@ ing with bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ts during the ra@@ iny se@@ as@@ on , In the sh@@ el@@ ters built by the U.@@ N@@ . , they were just provi@@ ding a pla@@ stic sh@@ e@@ et , and the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es had to cut the tre@@ es , and just like this ."
But over two million people cut tre@@ es .
"It just became big , he@@ av@@ y de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation and an environ@@ ment@@ al problem ."
"That is why they started provi@@ ding al@@ um@@ in@@ um pi@@ p@@ es , al@@ um@@ in@@ um bar@@ rac@@ ks ."
"@@ V@@ ery ex@@ pen@@ sive , they th@@ row them out for money , then cu@@ tting tre@@ es again ."
"So I pro@@ posed my idea to impro@@ ve the situ@@ ation using these re@@ cy@@ c@@ led pa@@ per tu@@ be@@ s because this is so che@@ a@@ p and also so stron@@ g , but my bud@@ get is only 50 U.@@ S. dollars per uni@@ t ."
"We built 50 uni@@ ts to do that as a mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing test for the du@@ ra@@ bility and mo@@ i@@ stu@@ re and ter@@ mi@@ tes , so on ."
"And then , year af@@ ter@@ ward , 199@@ 5 , in K@@ ob@@ e , J@@ ap@@ an , we had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"N@@ early 7@@ ,000 people were kil@@ led , and the city like this N@@ ag@@ ata di@@ stri@@ ct , all the city was bur@@ ned in a fi@@ re after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
And also I found out there &apos;s many V@@ ie@@ t@@ na@@ m@@ ese re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing and ga@@ ther@@ ing at a C@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c ch@@ ur@@ ch — all the building was tot@@ ally de@@ stro@@ yed .
"So I went there and also I pro@@ posed to the pr@@ ie@@ sts , &quot; Why don &apos;t we re@@ build the ch@@ ur@@ ch out of pa@@ per tu@@ be@@ s ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you c@@ razy ?"
"A@@ f@@ ter a fi@@ re , what are you pro@@ pos@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; So he never tru@@ st@@ ed me , but I didn &apos;t give up ."
"I started com@@ mu@@ ting to K@@ ob@@ e , and I met the society of V@@ ie@@ t@@ na@@ m@@ ese people ."
They were living like this with very po@@ or pla@@ stic sh@@ e@@ ets in the par@@ k .
So I pro@@ posed to re@@ build . I ra@@ is@@ ed — did fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing .
"I made a pa@@ per tu@@ be sh@@ el@@ ter for them , and in order to make it e@@ asy to be built by students and also e@@ asy to demo@@ li@@ sh , I used be@@ er c@@ r@@ ates as a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
"I asked the K@@ ir@@ in be@@ er company to pro@@ pos@@ e , because at that time , the A@@ sa@@ h@@ i be@@ er company made their pla@@ stic be@@ er c@@ r@@ ates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the pa@@ per tu@@ be@@ s ."
The color co@@ ordin@@ ation is very important .
"And also I still remember , we were expe@@ cting to have a be@@ er inside the pla@@ stic be@@ er c@@ r@@ ate , but it came em@@ p@@ ty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting ."
"So during the sum@@ m@@ er with my students , we built over 50 uni@@ ts of the sh@@ el@@ ters ."
"F@@ in@@ ally the pr@@ ie@@ st , finally he tru@@ st@@ ed me to re@@ build ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you colle@@ ct money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks re@@ building the ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"It was me@@ ant to st@@ ay there for three years , but actually it sta@@ yed there 10 years because people lo@@ ved it ."
"Th@@ en , in T@@ a@@ i@@ wa@@ n , they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and we pro@@ posed to d@@ on@@ ate this ch@@ ur@@ ch , so we dis@@ man@@ t@@ led them , we s@@ ent them over to be built by vol@@ un@@ te@@ er people ."
It sta@@ yed there in T@@ a@@ i@@ wa@@ n as a per@@ man@@ ent ch@@ ur@@ ch even now .
So this building became a per@@ man@@ ent building .
"Th@@ en I won@@ der , what is a per@@ man@@ ent and what is a tem@@ por@@ ary building ?"
E@@ ven a building made in pa@@ per can be per@@ man@@ ent as long as people love it .
E@@ ven a con@@ cre@@ te building can be very tem@@ por@@ ary if that is made to make money .
"In 199@@ 9 , in T@@ ur@@ key , the big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , I went there to use the local materi@@ al to build a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"@@ 200@@ 1 , in W@@ est Indi@@ a , I built also a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"In 200@@ 4 , in S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ ka , after the S@@ um@@ at@@ ra ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ su@@ nami , I re@@ built Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men &apos;s vi@@ ll@@ ages ."
"And in 200@@ 8 , in Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u , S@@ i@@ ch@@ u@@ an area in China , ne@@ ar@@ ly 7@@ 0,000 people were kil@@ led , and also es@@ pe@@ cially many of the scho@@ ols were de@@ stro@@ yed because of the cor@@ ru@@ ption between the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty and the con@@ trac@@ tor ."
I was asked to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary ch@@ ur@@ ch .
I brought my J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students to work with the Chin@@ ese students .
"In one mon@@ th , we comple@@ ted n@@ ine clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , over 500 squ@@ are me@@ ters ."
"It &apos;s still used , even after the cur@@ r@@ ent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in China ."
"In 200@@ 9 , in I@@ tal@@ y , L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"And this is a very interesting ph@@ oto : form@@ er P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er M@@ r. A@@ so — you know , because we have to change the pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er ever year ."
"And they are very kind , af@@ for@@ ding my model ."
"I pro@@ posed a big re@@ building , a tem@@ por@@ ary music h@@ all , because L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a is very fam@@ ous for music and all the con@@ cer@@ t hal@@ ls were de@@ stro@@ yed , so musi@@ ci@@ ans were moving out ."
"So I pro@@ posed to the ma@@ y@@ or , I &apos;d like to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary au@@ di@@ t@@ ori@@ um ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lu@@ ck@@ y ."
"M@@ r. B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i brought G@@ 8 sum@@ m@@ it , and our form@@ er pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er came , so they hel@@ ped us to colle@@ ct money , and I got half a million e@@ u@@ ro@@ s from the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese government to re@@ build this tem@@ por@@ ary au@@ di@@ t@@ ori@@ um ."
"@@ Ye@@ ar 20@@ 10 in Ha@@ it@@ i , there was a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but it &apos;s im@@ possible to f@@ ly over , so I went to S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go , ne@@ x@@ t-@@ door country , to dri@@ ve six hours to get to Ha@@ it@@ i with the local students in S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go to build 50 uni@@ ts of sh@@ el@@ ter out of local pa@@ per tu@@ be@@ s ."
"This is what happened in J@@ ap@@ an two years ago , in nor@@ ther@@ n J@@ ap@@ an ."
"A@@ f@@ ter the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ su@@ nami , people had to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated in a big room like a g@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um ."
But look at this . There &apos;s no pri@@ vac@@ y .
Pe@@ ople su@@ f@@ f@@ er ment@@ ally and physi@@ cally .
"So we went there to build parti@@ tions with all the stud@@ ent vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with pa@@ per tu@@ be@@ s , just a very simple sh@@ el@@ ter out of the tu@@ be fra@@ me and the cur@@ tain ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , some of the fac@@ i@@ lity au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them ."
But it &apos;s really ne@@ cess@@ ary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough f@@ lat area to build stan@@ d@@ ard government sing@@ le@@ -@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing like this one .
"L@@ ook at this . E@@ ven ci@@ vi@@ l government is doing such po@@ or con@@ stru@@ ction of the tem@@ por@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing , so den@@ se and so mess@@ y because there is no stor@@ age , nothing , water is le@@ aking , so I thought , we have to make mul@@ ti@@ -@@ story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very comfor@@ table ."
So I pro@@ posed to the ma@@ y@@ or while I was making parti@@ tions .
F@@ in@@ ally I met a very nice ma@@ y@@ or in O@@ na@@ ga@@ wa vi@@ ll@@ age in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i .
He asked me to build thre@@ e-@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing on bas@@ e@@ ball &#91; fie@@ l@@ ds &#93; .
"I used the shi@@ pping con@@ tain@@ er and also the students hel@@ ped us to make all the building f@@ ur@@ ni@@ ture to make them comfor@@ table , within the bud@@ get of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfor@@ table ."
M@@ any of the people want to st@@ ay here fore@@ ver .
I was very happy to hear that .
"Now I am working in New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"A@@ b@@ out 20 days before the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake happened , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and many J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students were also kil@@ led , and the most important ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral of the city , the sym@@ bo@@ l of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch , was tot@@ ally de@@ stro@@ yed ."
And I was asked to come to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral .
So this is under con@@ stru@@ ction .
And I &apos;d like to keep building mon@@ um@@ ents that are be@@ lo@@ ved by people .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What is going on in this b@@ aby &apos;s mind ?
"If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , inclu@@ ding psycho@@ logi@@ sts , would have said that this b@@ aby was ir@@ r@@ ational , il@@ logi@@ cal , e@@ go@@ cent@@ ri@@ c — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspe@@ ctive of another person or understand cause and effe@@ ct ."
"In the last 20 years , develo@@ p@@ ment@@ al science has completely over@@ turned that picture ."
"So in some ways , we think that this b@@ aby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most bri@@ lli@@ ant scienti@@ sts ."
Let me give you just one example of this .
"One thing that this b@@ aby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other b@@ aby ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , one of the things that &apos;s har@@ d@@ est for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling ."
And maybe the har@@ d@@ est thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
An@@ y@@ one who &apos;s fol@@ low@@ ed poli@@ ti@@ cs can te@@ sti@@ fy to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if b@@ ab@@ ies and young children could understand this really pro@@ found thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
"B@@ ab@@ ies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year@@ -@@ old to tell you what he thin@@ ks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stre@@ am of con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness mon@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ e about po@@ nie@@ s and bir@@ th@@ days and things like that ."
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the se@@ cre@@ t was bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
"What we did — Be@@ t@@ ty R@@ ap@@ ach@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the b@@ ab@@ ies two bow@@ ls of food : one bow@@ l of ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bow@@ l of deli@@ ci@@ ous g@@ ol@@ d@@ fish c@@ rac@@ k@@ ers ."
"Now all of the b@@ ab@@ ies , even in B@@ er@@ k@@ ley , like the c@@ rac@@ k@@ ers and don &apos;t like the ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
( Laughter ) But then what Be@@ t@@ ty did was to take a little ta@@ ste of food from each bow@@ l .
And she would act as if she li@@ ked it or she didn &apos;t .
"So half the time , she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the c@@ rac@@ k@@ ers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i — just like a b@@ aby and any other s@@ ane person ."
"But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m , bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"I ta@@ st@@ ed the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i . M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the c@@ rac@@ k@@ ers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , y@@ u@@ ck , c@@ rac@@ k@@ ers ."
"I ta@@ st@@ ed the c@@ rac@@ k@@ ers . E@@ w@@ w , y@@ u@@ ck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the op@@ posi@@ te of what the b@@ ab@@ ies wanted ."
We did this with 15 and 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old b@@ ab@@ ies .
"And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; C@@ an you give me some ? &quot;"
"So the question is : What would the b@@ aby give her , what they li@@ ked or what she li@@ ked ?"
"And the re@@ mark@@ able thing was that 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old b@@ ab@@ ies , just bar@@ ely wal@@ king and talking , would give her the c@@ rac@@ k@@ ers if she li@@ ked the c@@ rac@@ k@@ ers , but they would give her the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"O@@ n the other hand , 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds would st@@ are at her for a long time if she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out ."
"But then after they star@@ ed for a long time , they would just give her the c@@ rac@@ k@@ ers , what they thought everybody must like ."
So there are two really re@@ mark@@ able things about this .
"The first one is that these little 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old b@@ ab@@ ies have already disco@@ vered this really pro@@ found fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing ."
"And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted ."
"E@@ ven more re@@ mark@@ ably though , the fact that 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds didn &apos;t do this su@@ gg@@ est@@ s that these 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds had learned this de@@ ep , pro@@ found fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old ."
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hundre@@ ds and hundre@@ ds of stud@@ ies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a shor@@ t time ?
"I mean , after all , if you look at b@@ ab@@ ies super@@ fi@@ cially , they se@@ em pretty us@@ el@@ ess ."
"And actually in many ways , they &apos;re wor@@ se than us@@ el@@ ess , because we have to put so much time and energy into just ke@@ e@@ ping them ali@@ ve ."
"But if we turn to ev@@ olution for an answer to this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of why we spend so much time taking care of us@@ el@@ ess b@@ ab@@ ies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer ."
"If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pri@@ mat@@ es , but also inclu@@ ding other m@@ am@@ m@@ als , bir@@ ds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like k@@ ang@@ aro@@ os and wom@@ bat@@ s , it turns out that there &apos;s a relation@@ ship between how long a chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od a species has and how big their bra@@ ins are com@@ par@@ ed to their bod@@ ies and how s@@ mar@@ t and f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble they are ."
And sort of the post@@ er@@ bir@@ ds for this idea are the bir@@ ds up there .
O@@ n one side is a New C@@ ale@@ d@@ oni@@ an cro@@ w .
"And c@@ row@@ s and other cor@@ vi@@ da@@ e , ra@@ ven@@ s , ro@@ o@@ ks and so for@@ th , are incredi@@ bly s@@ mar@@ t bir@@ ds ."
They &apos;re as s@@ mar@@ t as ch@@ im@@ pan@@ ze@@ es in some re@@ spe@@ cts .
And this is a bir@@ d on the co@@ ver of science who &apos;s learned how to use a to@@ ol to get food .
"O@@ n the other hand , we have our friend the dom@@ esti@@ c chi@@ ck@@ en ."
And chi@@ ck@@ ens and du@@ cks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ ke@@ ys are basically as du@@ m@@ b as du@@ m@@ ps .
"So they &apos;re very , very good at pe@@ c@@ king for gra@@ in , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else ."
"Well it turns out that the b@@ ab@@ ies , the New C@@ ale@@ d@@ oni@@ an cro@@ w b@@ ab@@ ies , are f@@ le@@ d@@ gl@@ ings ."
"They de@@ p@@ end on their mom@@ s to dro@@ p wor@@ ms in their little open m@@ ou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bir@@ d ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the chi@@ ck@@ ens are actually mat@@ ure within a couple of months .
So chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od is the reason why the c@@ row@@ s end up on the co@@ ver of S@@ cien@@ ce and the chi@@ ck@@ ens end up in the s@@ ou@@ p po@@ t .
There &apos;s something about that long chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od that seem@@ s to be conne@@ cted to know@@ le@@ dge and lear@@ ning .
Well what kind of ex@@ plan@@ ation could we have for this ?
"Well some animals , like the chi@@ ck@@ en , se@@ em to be beauti@@ fully su@@ i@@ ted to doing just one thing very well ."
So they se@@ em to be beauti@@ fully su@@ i@@ ted to pe@@ c@@ king gra@@ in in one environment .
"O@@ ther cre@@ at@@ ures , like the c@@ row@@ s , ar@@ en &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extre@@ me@@ ly good at lear@@ ning about l@@ aw@@ s of different environ@@ ments ."
"And of course , we human be@@ ings are way out on the end of the di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion like the c@@ row@@ s ."
We have bi@@ g@@ ger bra@@ ins rel@@ ative to our bod@@ ies by far than any other ani@@ mal .
"We &apos;re s@@ mar@@ ter , we &apos;re more f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble , we can learn more , we survi@@ ve in more different environ@@ ments , we mi@@ gr@@ ated to co@@ ver the world and even go to ou@@ ter space ."
And our b@@ ab@@ ies and children are depen@@ dent on us for much longer than the b@@ ab@@ ies of any other species .
My son is 2@@ 3 .
"( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 2@@ 3 , we &apos;re still po@@ pping those wor@@ ms into those little open m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"A@@ ll right , why would we see this cor@@ rel@@ ation ?"
"Well an idea is that that strate@@ gy , that lear@@ ning strate@@ gy , is an extre@@ me@@ ly powerful , great strate@@ gy for getting on in the world , but it has one big dis@@ adv@@ an@@ t@@ age ."
"And that one big dis@@ adv@@ an@@ t@@ age is that , until you actually do all that lear@@ ning , you &apos;re going to be hel@@ pl@@ ess ."
"So you don &apos;t want to have the ma@@ st@@ od@@ on char@@ g@@ ing at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A s@@ lin@@ g@@ sh@@ ot or maybe a spe@@ ar might work . Wh@@ ich would actually be better ? &quot;"
You want to know all that before the ma@@ st@@ od@@ ons actually show up .
And the way the ev@@ olu@@ tions seem@@ s to have sol@@ ved that problem is with a kind of di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
So the idea is that we have this early per@@ i@@ od when we &apos;re completely prote@@ cted .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
"And then as ad@@ ul@@ ts , we can take all those things that we learned when we were b@@ ab@@ ies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world ."
So one way of thinking about it is that b@@ ab@@ ies and young children are like the research and develo@@ pment di@@ vision of the human species .
"So they &apos;re the prote@@ cted blue sk@@ y guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re produ@@ ction and marke@@ ting ."
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
"A@@ no@@ ther way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of b@@ ab@@ ies and children as being like de@@ fe@@ ctive grow@@ nu@@ ps , we should think about them as being a different develo@@ p@@ ment@@ al st@@ age of the same species — kind of like cat@@ er@@ pi@@ l@@ lars and bu@@ t@@ ter@@ fl@@ ies — ex@@ cept that they &apos;re actually the bri@@ lli@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ fl@@ ies who are f@@ lit@@ ting around the gar@@ den and expl@@ or@@ ing , and we &apos;re the cat@@ er@@ pi@@ l@@ lars who are in@@ ching along our nar@@ row , grow@@ n@@ up , ad@@ ul@@ t pat@@ h ."
"If this is true , if these b@@ ab@@ ies are desig@@ ned to learn — and this ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary story would say children are for lear@@ ning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expe@@ ct that they would have really powerful lear@@ ning mechani@@ s@@ ms ."
"And in fact , the b@@ aby &apos;s brain seem@@ s to be the most powerful lear@@ ning computer on the planet ."
But real compu@@ ters are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a re@@ v@@ olution in our under@@ standing of mach@@ ine lear@@ ning re@@ cent@@ ly .
"And it all depen@@ ds on the ideas of this guy , the Re@@ ver@@ end Th@@ om@@ as B@@ a@@ y@@ es , who was a st@@ ati@@ sti@@ ci@@ an and ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ an in the 1@@ 8@@ th century ."
"And essen@@ ti@@ ally what B@@ a@@ y@@ es did was to provi@@ de a ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal way using prob@@ ability the@@ ory to char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ ze , descri@@ be , the way that scienti@@ sts find out about the world ."
So what scienti@@ sts do is they have a hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis that they think might be li@@ ke@@ ly to start with .
They go out and test it against the evi@@ dence .
The evi@@ dence makes them change that hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis .
Th@@ en they test that new hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis and so on and so for@@ th .
And what B@@ a@@ y@@ es show@@ ed was a ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal way that you could do that .
And that ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs is at the cor@@ e of the best mach@@ ine lear@@ ning progra@@ ms that we have now .
"And some 10 years ago , I su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed that b@@ ab@@ ies might be doing the same thing ."
"So if you want to know what &apos;s going on under@@ ne@@ ath those beautiful b@@ row@@ n eyes , I think it actually looks something like this ."
This is Re@@ ver@@ end B@@ a@@ y@@ es &apos;s not@@ e@@ book .
So I think those b@@ ab@@ ies are actually making comp@@ lic@@ ated cal@@ cul@@ ations with con@@ di@@ ti@@ onal prob@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies that they &apos;re re@@ vi@@ sing to figure out how the world works .
"A@@ ll right , now that might se@@ em like an even tal@@ ler order to actually de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate ."
"Because after all , if you ask even grow@@ nu@@ ps about st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs , they look extre@@ me@@ ly stu@@ pi@@ d ."
How could it be that children are doing st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs ?
So to test this we used a mach@@ ine that we have called the B@@ li@@ ck@@ et De@@ te@@ ctor .
This is a box that li@@ ghts up and pla@@ ys music when you put some things on it and not others .
"And using this very simple mach@@ ine , my la@@ b and others have done do@@ z@@ ens of stud@@ ies show@@ ing just how good b@@ ab@@ ies are at lear@@ ning about the world ."
"L@@ et me men@@ tion just one that we did with T@@ um@@ ar K@@ us@@ h@@ ner , my stud@@ ent ."
"If I show@@ ed you this de@@ te@@ ctor , you would be li@@ ke@@ ly to think to beg@@ in with that the way to make the de@@ te@@ ctor go would be to put a blo@@ ck on top of the de@@ te@@ ctor ."
"But actually , this de@@ te@@ ctor works in a bit of a str@@ ange way ."
"Because if you wa@@ ve a blo@@ ck over the top of the de@@ te@@ ctor , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to beg@@ in with , the de@@ te@@ ctor will actually acti@@ v@@ ate two out of three times ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as , if you do the li@@ ke@@ ly thing , put the blo@@ ck on the de@@ te@@ ctor , it will only acti@@ v@@ ate two out of six times ."
So the un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis actually has stron@@ ger evi@@ dence .
It looks as if the wa@@ ving is a more effe@@ ctive strate@@ gy than the other strate@@ gy .
"So we did just this ; we gave four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds this pat@@ ter@@ n of evi@@ dence , and we just asked them to make it go ."
"And sure enough , the four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds used the evi@@ dence to wa@@ ve the obje@@ ct on top of the de@@ te@@ ctor ."
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
"The first one is , again , remember , these are four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds ."
They &apos;re just lear@@ ning how to coun@@ t .
"But un@@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously , they &apos;re doing these quite comp@@ lic@@ ated cal@@ cul@@ ations that will give them a con@@ di@@ ti@@ onal prob@@ ability meas@@ ure ."
"And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evi@@ dence to get to an idea , get to a hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis about the world , that seem@@ s very un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly to beg@@ in with ."
"And in stud@@ ies we &apos;ve just been doing in my la@@ b , si@@ mi@@ lar stud@@ ies , we &apos;ve show that four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds are actually better at fin@@ ding out an un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis than ad@@ ul@@ ts are when we give them exactly the same t@@ ask ."
"So in these cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces , the children are using st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs to find out about the world , but after all , scienti@@ sts also do experim@@ ents , and we wanted to see if children are doing experim@@ ents ."
When children do experim@@ ents we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bu@@ n@@ ch of interesting stud@@ ies re@@ cent@@ ly that have sh@@ own this playing around is really a kind of experim@@ ent@@ al research program .
Here &apos;s one from C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine Le@@ g@@ are &apos;s la@@ b .
What C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine did was use our B@@ li@@ ck@@ et De@@ te@@ ct@@ ors .
"And what she did was show children that y@@ el@@ low ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she show@@ ed them an an@@ om@@ al@@ y ."
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little bo@@ y will go through five hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es in the space of two minutes .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) Bo@@ y : How about this ?
S@@ ame as the other side .
"A@@ li@@ son G@@ op@@ nik : O@@ kay , so his first hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis has just been fal@@ si@@ f@@ ied ."
"( Laughter ) Bo@@ y : This one li@@ gh@@ ted up , and this one nothing ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , he &apos;s got his experim@@ ent@@ al not@@ e@@ book out ."
Bo@@ y : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
A@@ G : E@@ very scienti@@ st will re@@ cogni@@ ze that ex@@ pres@@ sion of des@@ pa@@ ir .
"( Laughter ) Bo@@ y : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis two ."
Bo@@ y : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Now this is his next idea .
"He told the experim@@ enter to do this , to try pu@@ tting it out on@@ to the other lo@@ cation ."
N@@ ot working either .
"B@@ o@@ y : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here ."
"O@@ h , the bot@@ tom of this box has electri@@ city in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electri@@ city ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , that &apos;s a f@@ our@@ th hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis ."
Bo@@ y : It &apos;s li@@ gh@@ ting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , there &apos;s his fi@@ f@@ th hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis ."
"Now that is a parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly — that is a parti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly ad@@ or@@ able and arti@@ cul@@ ate little bo@@ y , but what C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine disco@@ vered is this is actually quite ty@@ pi@@ cal ."
"If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to expla@@ in something , what they really do is do a ser@@ ies of experim@@ ents ."
This is actually pretty ty@@ pi@@ cal of four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds .
"Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of cre@@ ature ?"
What &apos;s it like to be one of these bri@@ lli@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ fl@@ ies who can test five hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es in two minutes ?
"Well , if you go back to those psycho@@ logi@@ sts and phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ ers , a lot of them have said that b@@ ab@@ ies and young children were bar@@ ely con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous if they were con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous at all ."
And I think just the op@@ posi@@ te is true .
I think b@@ ab@@ ies and children are actually more con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous than we are as ad@@ ul@@ ts .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how ad@@ ul@@ t con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness works .
And ad@@ ul@@ ts &apos; at@@ ten@@ tion and con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness look kind of like a spo@@ t@@ light .
"So what happens for ad@@ ul@@ ts is we deci@@ de that something &apos;s rele@@ v@@ ant or important , we should pay at@@ ten@@ tion to it ."
"O@@ ur con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness of that thing that we &apos;re at@@ ten@@ ding to be@@ comes extre@@ me@@ ly b@@ right and vi@@ vi@@ d , and everything else sort of goes dar@@ k ."
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
"So what happens when we pay at@@ ten@@ tion is that the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x , the sort of ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tive part of our bra@@ ins , sen@@ ds a sig@@ na@@ l that makes a little part of our brain much more f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble , more pla@@ stic , better at lear@@ ning , and sh@@ u@@ ts down acti@@ vity in all the rest of our bra@@ ins ."
"So we have a very fo@@ c@@ used , pur@@ pos@@ e-@@ dri@@ ven kind of at@@ ten@@ tion ."
"If we look at b@@ ab@@ ies and young children , we see something very different ."
I think b@@ ab@@ ies and young children se@@ em to have more of a lan@@ ter@@ n of con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness than a spo@@ t@@ light of con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness .
So b@@ ab@@ ies and young children are very bad at nar@@ row@@ ing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
"And if you actually look in their bra@@ ins , you see that they &apos;re flo@@ od@@ ed with these neuro@@ trans@@ mi@@ t@@ ters that are really good at indu@@ cing lear@@ ning and pla@@ sti@@ city , and the in@@ hi@@ bi@@ t@@ ory par@@ ts ha@@ ven &apos;t come on yet ."
"So when we say that b@@ ab@@ ies and young children are bad at pa@@ ying at@@ ten@@ tion , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not pa@@ ying at@@ ten@@ tion ."
So they &apos;re bad at getting ri@@ d of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
"That &apos;s the kind of at@@ ten@@ tion , the kind of con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness , that we might expe@@ ct from those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ fl@@ ies who are desig@@ ned to learn ."
"Well if we want to think about a way of getting a ta@@ ste of that kind of b@@ aby con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness as ad@@ ul@@ ts , I think the best thing is think about c@@ ases where we &apos;re put in a new situ@@ ation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we f@@ all in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time ."
"And what happens then is not that our con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness con@@ trac@@ ts , it ex@@ p@@ ands , so that those three days in Par@@ is se@@ em to be more full of con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness and experience than all the months of being a wal@@ king , talking , fac@@ ul@@ ty me@@ et@@ ing@@ -@@ at@@ ten@@ ding z@@ om@@ bie back home ."
"And by the way , that co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , that wonderful co@@ f@@ fe@@ e you &apos;ve been d@@ r@@ in@@ king dow@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s , actually mi@@ mi@@ cs the effe@@ ct of those b@@ aby neuro@@ trans@@ mi@@ t@@ ters ."
So what &apos;s it like to be a b@@ aby ?
It &apos;s like being in love in Par@@ is for the first time after you &apos;ve had three d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ es@@ pres@@ so@@ s .
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fanta@@ stic way to be , but it does ten@@ d to leave you wa@@ king up c@@ ry@@ ing at three o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the morning . ( Laughter )"
Now it &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful b@@ ab@@ ies are .
It &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
We can do things like t@@ ie our sho@@ el@@ ac@@ es and c@@ ross the stre@@ et by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of ef@@ for@@ t into making b@@ ab@@ ies think like ad@@ ul@@ ts do .
"But if what we want is to be like those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ fl@@ ies , to have open@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , open lear@@ ning , imag@@ in@@ ation , cre@@ ati@@ vity , in@@ no@@ vation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the ad@@ ul@@ ts to start thinking more like children ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ner .
And this is the name of my cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n : S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
"In N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber of 200@@ 3 , I was in@@ vi@@ ted to take part in the la@@ un@@ ch of N@@ el@@ son M@@ an@@ de@@ la &apos;s 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation — that is his HIV / AIDS f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
And 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 is the number that M@@ an@@ de@@ la had when he was im@@ pri@@ son@@ ed in Rob@@ be@@ n Is@@ land .
"And that &apos;s me with Y@@ ous@@ s@@ ou N &apos;@@ D@@ our , on@@ st@@ age , having the time of my life ."
"The next day , all the arti@@ sts were in@@ vi@@ ted to jo@@ in M@@ an@@ de@@ la in Rob@@ be@@ n Is@@ land , where he was going to give a con@@ fer@@ ence to the world &apos;s pre@@ ss , standing in front of his form@@ er pri@@ son cell ."
You can see the bar@@ s of the win@@ do@@ w there .
It was quite a mom@@ ent@@ ous oc@@ ca@@ sion for all of us .
"In that moment in time , M@@ an@@ de@@ la told the world &apos;s pre@@ ss that there was a vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de taking place in his country ; that post@@ -@@ a@@ par@@ the@@ id R@@ a@@ in@@ b@@ ow N@@ ation , a thous@@ and people were dy@@ ing on a da@@ i@@ ly basi@@ s and that the front line vi@@ cti@@ ms , the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able of all , were women and children ."
"This was a huge impac@@ t on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I ha@@ dn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS pan@@ demi@@ c was dire@@ ct@@ ly af@@ fe@@ cting women in such a way ."
"And so I com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted — when I left S@@ outh Africa , when I left C@@ a@@ pe@@ tow@@ n , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about ."
"I have to ser@@ ve . &quot; &quot; And so , sub@@ sequ@@ ently I parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed in every single 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent that I could take part in and gave news con@@ fer@@ ences , inter@@ vie@@ ws , talking and using my pl@@ at@@ form as a musi@@ ci@@ an , with my com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment to M@@ an@@ de@@ la — out of re@@ spe@@ ct for the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous , un@@ belie@@ v@@ able work that he had done ."
"E@@ very@@ one in the world re@@ spe@@ cts N@@ el@@ son M@@ an@@ de@@ la , everyone re@@ ver@@ es N@@ el@@ son M@@ an@@ de@@ la ."
"But do they all know about what has been taking place in S@@ outh Africa , his country , the country that had one of the high@@ est in@@ ci@@ d@@ ents of trans@@ mis@@ sion of the vi@@ ru@@ s ?"
"I think that if I went out into the stre@@ et now and I told people what was happening there , they would be sh@@ oc@@ ked ."
"I was very , very for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate a couple of years later to have met Z@@ ac@@ kie A@@ ch@@ m@@ at , the f@@ oun@@ der of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , an incredible cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ner and acti@@ vi@@ st ."
I met him at a 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent .
He was we@@ aring a t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t like the one I we@@ ar now .
"This is a to@@ ol — this tel@@ ls you I am in so@@ li@@ dar@@ ity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV ."
"And in a way because of the sti@@ g@@ ma , by we@@ aring this t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue ."
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the clo@@ set . &quot; &quot; I became a member of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n and I &apos;m very pro@@ u@@ d to be a member of that incredible organiz@@ ation .
"It &apos;s a gra@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ots cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n with 80 percent mem@@ ber@@ ship being women , most of wh@@ om are H@@ I@@ V@@ -@@ posi@@ tive ."
They work in the fie@@ ld .
They have tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous ou@@ tre@@ ach to the people who are living dire@@ ct@@ ly with the effe@@ cts of the vi@@ ru@@ s .
They have education progra@@ ms .
They bring out the issu@@ es of sti@@ g@@ ma .
It &apos;s quite ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary what they do .
"And y@@ es , my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n has sup@@ por@@ ted T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n in the way that I have tr@@ ied to ra@@ ise aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess and to try to also ra@@ ise fun@@ ds ."
"A lot of the fun@@ ding that I have man@@ aged to ra@@ ise has gone dire@@ ct@@ ly to T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n and the incredible work that they do , and are still contin@@ u@@ ing to do in S@@ outh Africa ."
So this is my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to sup@@ port me .
I &apos;ve tra@@ ve@@ led all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
"H@@ ere I am in O@@ sl@@ o in Nor@@ way , getting a nice , f@@ at che@@ ck ; sing@@ ing in H@@ ong K@@ ong , trying to get people to ra@@ ise money ."
"In Joh@@ an@@ n@@ es@@ bur@@ g , I had the opportunity to play to a ma@@ in@@ ly white , mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ clas@@ s S@@ outh Afri@@ can audience who en@@ ded up in te@@ ars because I use film cli@@ ps that really tou@@ ch the heart , the whole nature , of this terri@@ ble tra@@ ge@@ dy that is taking place , that people are ten@@ ding to av@@ o@@ id , because they are f@@ ati@@ gu@@ ed , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solu@@ tions are ."
"A@@ aro@@ n M@@ ot@@ so@@ ale@@ d@@ i , the cur@@ r@@ ent health min@@ ist@@ er , at@@ ten@@ ded that con@@ cer@@ t and I had an opportunity to me@@ et with him , and he gave his absolu@@ te com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment to try to making a change , which is absolu@@ tely ne@@ cess@@ ary ."
This is in the S@@ c@@ ot@@ ti@@ sh Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent .
I &apos;ve sub@@ sequ@@ ently become an en@@ vo@@ y for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land and HIV .
"And I was show@@ ing them my exper@@ ien@@ ces and trying to , again , ra@@ ise aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess ."
"And once again , in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh with the wonderful Afri@@ can Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s Ch@@ o@@ ir who I simply ad@@ ore ."
"And it &apos;s children like this , many of wh@@ om have been or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed because of their family being af@@ fe@@ cted by the AIDS vi@@ ru@@ s ."
I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Mi@@ ch@@ el S@@ i@@ di@@ be — he &apos;s the dire@@ ctor of U@@ N@@ AIDS .
"And I &apos;m very hon@@ o@@ red by the fact that Mi@@ ch@@ el in@@ vi@@ ted me , only a few months ago , to become a U@@ N@@ AIDS am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ or ."
"And in this way , I &apos;ve been str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening my pl@@ at@@ form and bro@@ ad@@ ening my ou@@ tre@@ ach ."
The mess@@ age that U@@ N@@ AIDS are cur@@ r@@ ently sen@@ ding out to the world is that we would like to see the vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al e@@ li@@ min@@ ation of the trans@@ mis@@ sion of the vi@@ ru@@ s from mother to child by 20@@ 15 .
It &apos;s a very am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous go@@ al but we believe it can be ach@@ ie@@ ved with poli@@ tical will .
This can happen .
"And here I am with a pre@@ gn@@ ant woman , who is HIV posi@@ tive and we &apos;re smi@@ ling , both of us are smi@@ ling , because we &apos;re very con@@ fi@@ dent , because we know that that young woman is re@@ cei@@ ving tre@@ at@@ ment so her life can be ex@@ ten@@ ded to take care of the b@@ aby she &apos;s about to give bir@@ th to ."
"And her b@@ aby will re@@ cei@@ ve P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , which will mean that that b@@ aby can be born f@@ ree of the vi@@ ru@@ s ."
Now that is pre@@ ven@@ tion at the very beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to start looking at inter@@ ven@@ tion with the AIDS pan@@ demi@@ c .
"Now , I just would like to fin@@ is@@ h off to tell you the little story about A@@ ve@@ li@@ le ."
This is A@@ ve@@ li@@ le — she goes with me wh@@ er@@ ever I go .
I tell her story to everyone because she re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts one of mi@@ llions of HIV / AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans .
A@@ ve@@ li@@ le &apos;s mother had HIV vi@@ ru@@ s — she d@@ ied from AID@@ S@@ -@@ re@@ lated il@@ l@@ ness .
"A@@ ve@@ li@@ le had the vi@@ ru@@ s , she was born with the vi@@ ru@@ s ."
"And here she is at seven years old , we@@ igh@@ ing no more than a one year@@ -@@ old b@@ aby ."
"A@@ t this point in her life , she &apos;s su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing with fu@@ ll@@ -@@ b@@ low@@ n AIDS and had p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia ."
We met her in a ho@@ spit@@ al in the E@@ ast@@ er@@ n C@@ ap@@ e and spent a whole af@@ ter@@ no@@ on with her — an ad@@ or@@ able child .
The do@@ ct@@ ors and n@@ ur@@ ses were ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
They put her on very spe@@ cial n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ti@@ ous d@@ ie@@ t and took great care of her .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the ho@@ spit@@ al — because we fil@@ med her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survi@@ ve .
"So , it was obvi@@ ously — it was a very emoti@@ onal en@@ coun@@ ter and left us feeling very re@@ son@@ ant with this dire@@ ct experience , this one child , you know , that story ."
"F@@ i@@ ve months later , we went back to S@@ outh Africa to me@@ et A@@ ve@@ li@@ le again ."
And I &apos;m getting — the ha@@ ir@@ s on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the ha@@ ir@@ s on my ar@@ ms .
They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the trans@@ form@@ ation that took place .
I@@ sn &apos;t it ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ?
( Applause ) That round of ap@@ plause is actually for the do@@ ct@@ ors and n@@ ur@@ ses of the ho@@ spit@@ al who took care of A@@ ve@@ li@@ le .
And I take it that you ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate that kind of trans@@ form@@ ation .
"So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have ac@@ cess to good n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion and good medi@@ cal care , and you believe that the M@@ il@@ len@@ ni@@ um D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ pment Go@@ als , speci@@ fi@@ cally five and six , should be absolu@@ tely com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted to by all govern@@ ments around the world — es@@ pe@@ cially in sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa — could you ple@@ ase stand up ."
"I think that &apos;s fa@@ ir to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the h@@ all ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty years ago in the old S@@ o@@ vie@@ t Uni@@ on , a team of engine@@ ers was se@@ cre@@ tly moving a large obje@@ ct through a des@@ ol@@ ate coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
"Wi@@ th it , they were hop@@ ing to cap@@ ture the min@@ ds of people every@@ where by being the first to con@@ qu@@ er ou@@ ter space ."
The ro@@ ck@@ et was huge .
And pac@@ ked in its no@@ se was a sil@@ ver ball with two radi@@ os inside .
"O@@ n O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 4 , 19@@ 5@@ 7 , they la@@ un@@ ched their ro@@ ck@@ et ."
One of the R@@ us@@ si@@ an scienti@@ sts wro@@ te at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik .
"In the ol@@ den days , expl@@ or@@ ers like V@@ as@@ co da G@@ ama and Col@@ um@@ bu@@ s had the good for@@ tu@@ ne to open up the ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al g@@ lo@@ be ."
Now we have the good for@@ tu@@ ne to open up space .
"And it is for those in the future to en@@ v@@ y us our jo@@ y . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wat@@ ching s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts from &quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik , &quot; &quot; my fi@@ f@@ th do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ary fe@@ ature , which is just about comple@@ ted ."
"It tel@@ ls the story of S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik , and the story of what happened to America as a resul@@ t ."
"For days after the la@@ un@@ ch , S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik was a wonderful cu@@ ri@@ osi@@ ty ."
"A man@@ -@@ made mo@@ on visi@@ ble by ordin@@ ary ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , it inspi@@ red a@@ we and pri@@ de that hum@@ ans had finally la@@ un@@ ched an obje@@ ct into space ."
"But just three days later , on a day they called R@@ ed M@@ on@@ day , the media and the poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans told us , and we belie@@ ved , that S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik was pro@@ of that our ene@@ my had be@@ at@@ en us in science and technology , and that they could now att@@ ack us with hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en b@@ om@@ b@@ s , using their S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik ro@@ ck@@ et as an I@@ B@@ M mis@@ si@@ le ."
All he@@ ll bro@@ ke lo@@ ose .
S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik quickly became one of the three great sh@@ oc@@ ks to h@@ it America — histori@@ ans say the equ@@ al of P@@ ear@@ l H@@ ar@@ b@@ or or 9 / 11 .
It pro@@ vo@@ ked the mis@@ si@@ le ga@@ p .
It ex@@ plo@@ ded an ar@@ ms rac@@ e .
It began the space rac@@ e .
"Wi@@ th@@ in a year , Con@@ gre@@ ss fun@@ ded huge we@@ apo@@ ns incre@@ ases , and we went from 1@@ ,@@ 2@@ 00 nuclear we@@ apo@@ ns to 20@@ ,000 ."
And the re@@ ac@@ tions to S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik went far be@@ y@@ ond we@@ apo@@ ns incre@@ ases .
"For example , some here will remember this day , Ju@@ ne 19@@ 5@@ 8 , the N@@ ational C@@ i@@ vi@@ l D@@ ef@@ en@@ se D@@ ri@@ ll , where ten@@ s of mi@@ llions of people in 7@@ 8 cities went under@@ ground ."
"O@@ r the G@@ al@@ lu@@ p P@@ ol@@ l that show@@ ed that seven in 10 Ameri@@ cans belie@@ ved that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our popul@@ ation was going to be kil@@ led ."
But S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik pro@@ vo@@ ked wonderful chang@@ es as well .
"For example , some in this room went to school on sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship because of S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik ."
"S@@ up@@ port for engine@@ ering , mat@@ h and science — education in gener@@ al — bo@@ om@@ ed ."
"And V@@ int C@@ er@@ f poin@@ ts out that S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik led dire@@ ct@@ ly to A@@ R@@ P@@ A , and the Inter@@ net , and , of course , N@@ A@@ SA ."
My fe@@ ature do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ary shows how a f@@ ree society can be st@@ am@@ pe@@ ded by those who know how to use media .
"But it also shows how we can turn what ap@@ pe@@ ars at first to be a bad situ@@ ation , into something that was over@@ all very good for America ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik &quot; &quot; will so@@ on be rele@@ as@@ ed .

I &apos;ve been at M@@ I@@ T for 4@@ 4 years .
And the third is a little bit less obvi@@ ous .
"H@@ a@@ ve they all ag@@ re@@ ed ? No , not completely ."
I &apos;ll bu@@ y it . I have so much money .
"I have so much money , it takes me fore@@ ver ."
"I gre@@ w up in Bi@@ ha@@ r , Indi@@ a &apos;s po@@ ore@@ st state , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a car@@ t full of the most deli@@ ci@@ ous s@@ wee@@ ts at our do@@ or@@ ste@@ p ."
"My bro@@ thers and I du@@ g in , and that &apos;s when my father came home ."
"He was li@@ vi@@ d , and I still remember how we c@@ ried when that car@@ t with our hal@@ f-@@ e@@ at@@ en s@@ wee@@ ts was pul@@ led away from us ."
"L@@ ater , I under@@ sto@@ od why my father got so up@@ set ."
Th@@ ose s@@ wee@@ ts were a bri@@ be from a con@@ trac@@ tor who was trying to get my father to aw@@ ard him a government con@@ trac@@ t .
"My father was respon@@ si@@ ble for building ro@@ ads in Bi@@ ha@@ r , and he had develo@@ ped a fir@@ m stance against cor@@ ru@@ ption , even though he was har@@ as@@ sed and thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed ."
"H@@ is was a lon@@ ely stru@@ gg@@ le , because Bi@@ ha@@ r was also Indi@@ a &apos;s most cor@@ ru@@ pt state , where public offi@@ ci@@ als were en@@ ri@@ ching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than ser@@ ving the po@@ or who had no means to ex@@ pre@@ ss their ang@@ u@@ is@@ h if their children had no food or no scho@@ ol@@ ing ."
And I exper@@ ien@@ ced this most vi@@ sc@@ er@@ ally when I tra@@ ve@@ led to re@@ mot@@ e vi@@ ll@@ ages to study po@@ ver@@ ty .
"And as I went vi@@ ll@@ age to vi@@ ll@@ age , I remember one day , when I was fami@@ shed and ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ed , and I was almost col@@ lap@@ sing in a sc@@ or@@ ching he@@ at under a t@@ ree , and just at that time , one of the po@@ ore@@ st men in that vi@@ ll@@ age in@@ vi@@ ted me into his hu@@ t and g@@ rac@@ i@@ ously f@@ ed me ."
O@@ n@@ ly I later realized that what he f@@ ed me was food for his entire family for two days .
This pro@@ found gi@@ ft of gener@@ osi@@ ty challen@@ g@@ ed and changed the very pur@@ pos@@ e of my life .
I re@@ sol@@ ved to give back .
"L@@ ater , I jo@@ ined the World B@@ ank , which s@@ ou@@ ght to fi@@ ght such po@@ ver@@ ty by trans@@ fer@@ ring a@@ id from ri@@ ch to po@@ or countries ."
"My ini@@ tial work fo@@ c@@ used on U@@ g@@ an@@ da , where I fo@@ c@@ used on neg@@ oti@@ ating re@@ form@@ s with the F@@ in@@ ance M@@ in@@ ist@@ ry of U@@ g@@ an@@ da so they could ac@@ cess our lo@@ ans ."
"But after we dis@@ bur@@ sed the lo@@ ans , I remember a tri@@ p in U@@ g@@ an@@ da where I found ne@@ w@@ ly built scho@@ ols without te@@ x@@ t@@ boo@@ ks or teach@@ ers , new health c@@ lini@@ cs without dru@@ gs , and the po@@ or once again without any vo@@ ice or re@@ course ."
It was Bi@@ ha@@ r all over again .
Bi@@ ha@@ r re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts the challen@@ ge of develo@@ pment : ab@@ je@@ ct po@@ ver@@ ty sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by cor@@ ru@@ ption .
"G@@ lob@@ ally , 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people live on less than $ 1@@ .@@ 25 a day , and the work I did in U@@ g@@ an@@ da re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts the tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal appro@@ ach to these problems that has been prac@@ ti@@ ced since 19@@ 4@@ 4 , when win@@ n@@ ers of World W@@ ar I@@ I , 500 f@@ oun@@ ding fa@@ thers , and one lon@@ ely f@@ oun@@ ding mother , ga@@ ther@@ ed in New H@@ am@@ p@@ shi@@ re , USA , to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh the B@@ re@@ t@@ ton W@@ o@@ ods institu@@ tions , inclu@@ ding the World B@@ ank ."
"And that tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal appro@@ ach to develo@@ pment had three key ele@@ ments . F@@ ir@@ st , trans@@ f@@ er of re@@ sources from ri@@ ch countries in the Nor@@ th to po@@ ore@@ r countries in the S@@ outh , ac@@ comp@@ an@@ ied by re@@ form pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tions ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , the develo@@ pment institu@@ tions that ch@@ an@@ ne@@ led these trans@@ f@@ ers were op@@ a@@ qu@@ e , with little tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy of what they fin@@ an@@ ced or what resul@@ ts they ach@@ ie@@ ved ."
"And third , the eng@@ ag@@ ement in develo@@ ping countries was with a nar@@ row set of government e@@ li@@ tes with little inter@@ action with the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , who are the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ci@@ ar@@ ies of develo@@ pment as@@ si@@ stance ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , each of these ele@@ ments is open@@ ing up du@@ e to dra@@ m@@ atic chang@@ es in the global environment ."
"O@@ p@@ en know@@ le@@ dge , open a@@ id , open govern@@ ance , and together , they re@@ present three key shi@@ f@@ ts that are trans@@ form@@ ing develo@@ pment and that also h@@ old gre@@ ater hope for the problems I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed in U@@ g@@ an@@ da and in Bi@@ ha@@ r ."
The first key shi@@ ft is open know@@ le@@ dge .
"You know , develo@@ ping countries today will not simply ac@@ cept solu@@ tions that are h@@ an@@ ded down to them by the U.@@ S. , Europ@@ e or the World B@@ ank ."
"They get their in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation , their hope , their prac@@ tical know@@ -@@ how , from suc@@ cess@@ ful em@@ er@@ g@@ ing econom@@ ies in the S@@ outh ."
"They want to know how China li@@ f@@ ted 500 million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty in 30 years , how M@@ exi@@ co &apos;s O@@ portuni@@ da@@ des program impro@@ ved scho@@ ol@@ ing and n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion for mi@@ llions of children ."
"This is the new e@@ co@@ system of open@@ -@@ know@@ le@@ dge f@@ low@@ s , not just tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing Nor@@ th to S@@ outh , but S@@ outh to S@@ outh , and even S@@ outh to Nor@@ th , with M@@ exi@@ co &apos;s O@@ portuni@@ da@@ des today in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing New York C@@ ity ."
"And just as these Nor@@ th@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ S@@ outh trans@@ f@@ ers are open@@ ing up , so too are the develo@@ pment institu@@ tions that ch@@ an@@ ne@@ led these trans@@ f@@ ers ."
This is the second shi@@ ft : open a@@ id .
"R@@ e@@ cent@@ ly , the World B@@ ank open@@ ed its v@@ au@@ l@@ t of data for public use , rele@@ as@@ ing 8@@ ,000 economic and social indi@@ cat@@ ors for 2@@ 00 countries over 50 years , and it la@@ un@@ ched a global compe@@ ti@@ tion to c@@ row@@ d@@ source in@@ no@@ v@@ ative app@@ s using this data ."
D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ pment institu@@ tions today are also open@@ ing for public sc@@ ru@@ t@@ iny the proje@@ cts they fin@@ ance .
"T@@ ake G@@ e@@ o@@ Ma@@ pping . In this ma@@ p from Ken@@ ya , the red d@@ ots show where all the scho@@ ols fin@@ an@@ ced by d@@ on@@ ors are lo@@ c@@ ated , and the dar@@ k@@ er the sha@@ de of green , the more the number of out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ school children ."
"So this simple mas@@ h@@ up re@@ ve@@ als that d@@ on@@ ors have not fin@@ an@@ ced any scho@@ ols in the are@@ as with the most out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ school children , pro@@ vo@@ king new questions . Is develo@@ pment as@@ si@@ stance tar@@ ge@@ ting those who most need our help ?"
"In this man@@ ner , the World B@@ ank has now G@@ e@@ o@@ Ma@@ pped 3@@ 0,000 project acti@@ vi@@ ties in 1@@ 4@@ 3 countries , and d@@ on@@ ors are using a common pl@@ at@@ form to ma@@ p all their proje@@ cts ."
This is a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous lea@@ p forward in tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy and ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability of a@@ id .
"And this le@@ ads me to the third , and in my view , the most sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant shi@@ ft in develo@@ pment : open govern@@ ance . G@@ over@@ n@@ ments today are open@@ ing up just as ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens are de@@ man@@ ding vo@@ ice and ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability ."
"F@@ ro@@ m the A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing to the An@@ na H@@ az@@ are movement in Indi@@ a , using mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones and social media not just for poli@@ tical ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability but also for develo@@ pment ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability ."
A@@ re govern@@ ments deli@@ ver@@ ing ser@@ vi@@ ces to the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ?
"So for in@@ stance , se@@ ver@@ al govern@@ ments in Africa and E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Europ@@ e are open@@ ing their bud@@ gets to the public ."
"But , you know , there is a big difference between a bud@@ get that &apos;s public and a bud@@ get that &apos;s ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble ."
"This is a public bud@@ get . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble or under@@ stan@@ d@@ able to an ordin@@ ary ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en that is trying to understand how the government is sp@@ ending its re@@ sources ."
"To t@@ ac@@ k@@ le this problem , govern@@ ments are using new to@@ ols to vi@@ su@@ ali@@ ze the bud@@ get so it &apos;s more under@@ stan@@ d@@ able to the public ."
"In this ma@@ p from M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a , the green color shows those di@@ stri@@ cts that have low sp@@ ending on scho@@ ols but good edu@@ c@@ ational out@@ comes , and the red color shows the op@@ posi@@ te ."
"T@@ o@@ ols like this help turn a sh@@ el@@ f full of in@@ sc@@ ru@@ table do@@ cu@@ ments into a publi@@ c@@ ly under@@ stan@@ d@@ able vi@@ su@@ al , and what &apos;s exci@@ ting is that with this open@@ ness , there are today new opportuni@@ ties for ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens to give fe@@ ed@@ back and eng@@ age with government ."
"So in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines today , parents and students can give re@@ al@@ -@@ time fe@@ ed@@ back on a we@@ b@@ site , Ch@@ e@@ ck@@ my@@ scho@@ ol@@ .@@ or@@ g , or using S@@ M@@ S , whether teach@@ ers and te@@ x@@ t@@ boo@@ ks are show@@ ing up in school , the same problems I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed in U@@ g@@ an@@ da and in Bi@@ ha@@ r ."
"And the government is respon@@ sive . So for in@@ stance , when it was re@@ por@@ ted on this we@@ b@@ site that 8@@ 00 students were at ri@@ sk because school re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s had stal@@ led du@@ e to cor@@ ru@@ ption , the De@@ part@@ ment of E@@ du@@ cation in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines took s@@ wi@@ ft action ."
"And you know what &apos;s exci@@ ting is that this in@@ no@@ vation is now sp@@ re@@ ading S@@ outh to S@@ outh , from the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines to In@@ d@@ one@@ si@@ a , Ken@@ ya , M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a and be@@ y@@ ond ."
"In D@@ ar es S@@ al@@ a@@ am , T@@ an@@ z@@ ania , even an im@@ po@@ ver@@ i@@ shed community was able to use these to@@ ols to vo@@ ice its as@@ pi@@ r@@ ations ."
"This is what the ma@@ p of T@@ and@@ ale looked like in Au@@ g@@ ust , 20@@ 11 . But within a few weeks , uni@@ versity students were able to use mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones and an open@@ -@@ source pl@@ at@@ form to dra@@ m@@ ati@@ cally ma@@ p the entire community in@@ fra@@ structure ."
"And what is very exci@@ ting is that ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens were then able to give fe@@ ed@@ back as to which health or water poin@@ ts were not working , ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated in the red bu@@ b@@ b@@ les that you see , which together provi@@ des a gra@@ phi@@ c vi@@ su@@ al of the colle@@ ctive vo@@ i@@ ces of the po@@ or ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , even Bi@@ ha@@ r is tur@@ ning around and open@@ ing up under a com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship that is making government tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent , ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble and respon@@ sive to the po@@ or ."
"But , you know , in many par@@ ts of the world , govern@@ ments are not interested in open@@ ing up or in ser@@ ving the po@@ or , and it is a real challen@@ ge for those who want to change the system ."
"These are the lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors like my father and many , many others , and a key fron@@ t@@ ier of develo@@ pment work is to help these lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors jo@@ in h@@ ands so they can together over@@ come the od@@ ds ."
"So for in@@ stance , today , in G@@ h@@ ana , cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous re@@ form@@ ers from ci@@ vi@@ l society , Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent and government , have for@@ g@@ ed a co@@ ali@@ tion for tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent con@@ trac@@ ts in the oil se@@ ctor , and , gal@@ v@@ ani@@ zed by this , re@@ form@@ ers in Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent are now inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ating du@@ bi@@ ous con@@ trac@@ ts ."
"These exam@@ ples give new hope , new possi@@ bility to the problems I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed in U@@ g@@ an@@ da or that my father con@@ fron@@ ted in Bi@@ ha@@ r ."
"T@@ wo years ago , on Ap@@ ri@@ l 8@@ th , 20@@ 10 , I called my father ."
"It was very l@@ ate at night , and at age 80 , he was ty@@ ping a 7@@ 0-@@ p@@ age public inter@@ est li@@ ti@@ g@@ ation against cor@@ ru@@ ption in a ro@@ ad project ."
"Th@@ ough he was no la@@ wy@@ er , he ar@@ gu@@ ed the case in cour@@ t hi@@ m@@ self the next day . He won the ru@@ ling , but later that very ev@@ ening , he fe@@ ll , and he d@@ ied ."
"He f@@ ou@@ ght ti@@ ll the end , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate that to com@@ b@@ at cor@@ ru@@ ption and po@@ ver@@ ty , not only did government offi@@ ci@@ als need to be hon@@ est , but ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens needed to jo@@ in together to make their vo@@ i@@ ces heard ."
"These became the two bo@@ ok@@ en@@ ds of his life , and the jour@@ ney he tra@@ ve@@ led in between mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red the chang@@ ing develo@@ pment land@@ s@@ cape ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , I &apos;m inspi@@ red by these chang@@ es , and I &apos;m exci@@ ted that at the World B@@ ank , we are em@@ brac@@ ing these new dire@@ ctions , a sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant de@@ par@@ ture from my work in U@@ g@@ an@@ da 20 years ago ."
"We need to radi@@ cally open up develo@@ pment so know@@ le@@ dge f@@ low@@ s in mul@@ ti@@ ple dire@@ ctions , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers , so a@@ id be@@ comes tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent , ac@@ coun@@ table and effe@@ ctive , so govern@@ ments open up and ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens are eng@@ aged and em@@ power@@ ed with re@@ form@@ ers in government ."
We need to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate these shi@@ f@@ ts .
"If we do , we will find that the colle@@ ctive vo@@ i@@ ces of the po@@ or will be heard in Bi@@ ha@@ r , in U@@ g@@ an@@ da , and be@@ y@@ ond ."
We will find that te@@ x@@ t@@ boo@@ ks and teach@@ ers will show up in scho@@ ols for their children .
"We will find that these children , too , have a real ch@@ ance of bre@@ aking their way out of po@@ ver@@ ty ."
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
"So imagine that a pl@@ ane is about to c@@ ra@@ sh with 2@@ 50 children and b@@ ab@@ ies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?"
Now imagine that 60 plan@@ es full of b@@ ab@@ ies under five c@@ ra@@ sh every single day .
That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
6@@ .@@ 6 million children never make it to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
"Mo@@ st of these de@@ a@@ ths are pre@@ v@@ ent@@ able , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sa@@ d , it makes me ang@@ ry , and it makes me de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed ."
"D@@ i@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a and p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia are am@@ ong the top two kil@@ l@@ ers of children under five , and what we can do to pre@@ v@@ ent these dise@@ ases isn &apos;t some s@@ mar@@ t , new technologi@@ cal in@@ no@@ v@@ ations ."
It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s ol@@ d@@ est inv@@ en@@ tions : a b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p .
"W@@ ash@@ ing h@@ ands with so@@ a@@ p , a ha@@ bit we all take for gran@@ ted , can redu@@ ce di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a by half , can redu@@ ce re@@ sp@@ ir@@ at@@ ory in@@ fe@@ ctions by one third ."
"H@@ and@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p can have an impac@@ t on redu@@ cing f@@ lu , tr@@ ach@@ om@@ a , S@@ A@@ R@@ S , and most re@@ cent@@ ly in the case of ch@@ ol@@ era and E@@ b@@ ol@@ a out@@ bre@@ ak , one of the key inter@@ ven@@ tions is hand@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ."
H@@ and@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ke@@ e@@ ps kids in school .
It stop@@ s b@@ ab@@ ies from dy@@ ing .
H@@ and@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p is one of the most co@@ st@@ -@@ effe@@ ctive ways of sa@@ ving children &apos;s lives .
"It can sa@@ ve over 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 children every year ."
That &apos;s the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of stop@@ ping 10 j@@ um@@ bo je@@ ts full of b@@ ab@@ ies and children from c@@ ra@@ sh@@ ing every single day .
I think you &apos;ll ag@@ ree with me that that &apos;s a pretty us@@ e@@ ful public health inter@@ ven@@ tion .
So now just take a minu@@ te .
I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
Why don &apos;t you just sha@@ ke their h@@ ands .
P@@ le@@ ase sha@@ ke their h@@ ands .
"A@@ ll right , get to know each other ."
They look really pretty .
All right .
"So what if I told you that the person wh@@ ose h@@ ands you just sho@@ ok actually didn &apos;t wa@@ sh their h@@ ands when they were coming out of the to@@ i@@ let ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty any@@ more , right ?"
"P@@ re@@ t@@ ty y@@ u@@ ck@@ y , you would ag@@ ree with me ."
"Well , st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs are actually show@@ ing that four people out of five don &apos;t wa@@ sh their h@@ ands when they come out of the to@@ i@@ let , glob@@ ally ."
"And the same way , we don &apos;t do it when we &apos;ve got fan@@ cy to@@ i@@ le@@ ts , ru@@ n@@ ning water , and so@@ a@@ p available , it &apos;s the same thing in the countries where child mor@@ t@@ ality is really high ."
What is it ? Is there no so@@ a@@ p ?
"A@@ c@@ tually , so@@ a@@ p is available ."
"In 90 percent of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in Indi@@ a , 9@@ 4 percent of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in Ken@@ ya , you will find so@@ a@@ p ."
"E@@ ven in countries where so@@ a@@ p is the low@@ est , like E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , we are at 50 percent ."
So why is it ?
Why ar@@ en &apos;t people wa@@ sh@@ ing their h@@ ands ?
"Wh@@ y is it that Ma@@ y@@ ank , this young bo@@ y that I met in Indi@@ a , isn &apos;t wa@@ sh@@ ing his h@@ ands ?"
"Well , in Ma@@ y@@ ank &apos;s family , so@@ a@@ p is used for ba@@ thing , so@@ a@@ p is used for la@@ un@@ d@@ ry , so@@ a@@ p is used for wa@@ sh@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es ."
"H@@ is parents think sometimes it &apos;s a pre@@ ci@@ ous com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cu@@ p@@ bo@@ ard ."
They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t wa@@ ste it .
What &apos;s the resul@@ t of that ?
"Ch@@ il@@ dren pi@@ ck up dise@@ ase in the place that &apos;s sup@@ posed to love them and prote@@ ct them the most , in their hom@@ es ."
Th@@ in@@ k about where you learned to wa@@ sh your h@@ ands .
D@@ id you learn to wa@@ sh your h@@ ands at home ?
D@@ id you learn to wa@@ sh your h@@ ands in school ?
I think behavi@@ or@@ al scienti@@ sts will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the ha@@ bi@@ ts that you have had early in life .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , we all cop@@ y what everyone else does , and local cul@@ tu@@ ral nor@@ ms are something that sha@@ pe how we change our behavi@@ or , and this is where the pri@@ v@@ ate se@@ ctor comes in ."
"M@@ any women in Indi@@ a will tell you they learned all about hy@@ g@@ ie@@ ne , dise@@ ases , from this b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p from Li@@ fe@@ bu@@ o@@ y br@@ and ."
I@@ con@@ ic bran@@ ds like this one have a respon@@ si@@ bility to do good in the places where they se@@ ll their produ@@ cts .
"It &apos;s that belie@@ f , p@@ lu@@ s the scale of Uni@@ le@@ ver , that allow@@ s us to keep talking about hand@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p and hy@@ g@@ ie@@ ne to these mo@@ thers ."
Bi@@ g bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es and bran@@ ds can change and shi@@ ft those social nor@@ ms and make a difference for those ha@@ bi@@ ts that are so stu@@ b@@ born .
Th@@ in@@ k about it : Mar@@ ke@@ te@@ ers spend all their time making us s@@ wit@@ ch from one br@@ and to the other .
"And actually , they know how to trans@@ form science and fac@@ ts into compe@@ l@@ ling mess@@ ages ."
"J@@ ust for a minu@@ te , imagine when they put all their for@@ ces behind a mess@@ age as powerful as hand@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ."

"A hundre@@ d and e@@ igh@@ te@@ en years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about en@@ sur@@ ing that they have ac@@ cess to this b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop ch@@ ol@@ era from sp@@ re@@ ading ."
"I think this dri@@ ve for prof@@ it is extre@@ me@@ ly powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most com@@ mi@@ t@@ ted ch@@ ari@@ ty or government ."

"O@@ ver the last four years , business has grow@@ n d@@ ou@@ ble di@@ gi@@ ts , wh@@ il@@ st child mor@@ t@@ ality has redu@@ ced in all the places where so@@ a@@ p use has incre@@ as@@ ed ."
It may be un@@ comfor@@ table for some to hear — business grow@@ th and lives sa@@ ved some@@ how equ@@ ated in the same s@@ ent@@ ence — but it is that business grow@@ th that allow@@ s us to keep doing more .
"Wi@@ th@@ out it , and without talking about it , we cannot ach@@ ie@@ ve the change that we need ."
"L@@ ast week , my team and I spent time visi@@ ting mo@@ thers that have all exper@@ ien@@ ced the same thing : the death of a ne@@ w@@ born ."
I &apos;m a mo@@ m . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more pain@@ ful .
This one is from M@@ y@@ an@@ m@@ ar .
"S@@ he had the most beautiful smi@@ le , the smi@@ le , I think , that life gi@@ ves you when you &apos;ve had a second ch@@ ance ."
"H@@ er son , M@@ y@@ o , is her second one ."
"And next time you think of a gi@@ ft for a new mo@@ m and her family , don &apos;t look far : bu@@ y her so@@ a@@ p ."
It &apos;s the most beautiful inv@@ en@@ tion in public health .
I hope you will jo@@ in us and make hand@@ wa@@ sh@@ ing part of your da@@ i@@ ly lives and our da@@ i@@ ly lives and help more children like M@@ y@@ o re@@ ach their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
Thank you .
( Applause )
And it is quite possi@@ bly the largest ever disco@@ vered .
The inter@@ national cri@@ min@@ al tri@@ bu@@ na@@ l deli@@ vered a number of s@@ ent@@ ences for cri@@ mes against hum@@ ani@@ ty and gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de .
A@@ s much as gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de is about kil@@ ling .
Thank you very much .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0-@@ day challen@@ ges .
This was part of a challen@@ ge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ rou@@ s before I started my 3@@ 0-@@ day challen@@ ges .
It &apos;s aw@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun ."
( Applause )
"H@@ i . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in pro@@ gre@@ ss ."
"S@@ in@@ ce we are still realiz@@ ing these works , we are lar@@ ge@@ ly working within the re@@ al@@ m of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion and m@@ yst@@ ery , still ."
"A vie@@ wer sort of un@@ s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct@@ ing@@ ly wal@@ ks into the room , and cat@@ ch@@ es a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of these pan@@ els in a mess@@ y com@@ posi@@ tion on the w@@ all ."
( Laughter ) So this is the sk@@ et@@ ch of the two st@@ ates .
One is tot@@ al cha@@ os . The other is absolu@@ te order .
This also re@@ min@@ ded us of two very different pi@@ ct@@ ori@@ al tra@@ di@@ tions .
"One is the al@@ t@@ ar tab@@ le@@ ts of the 1@@ 5@@ th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , M@@ al@@ ev@@ ich &apos;s ab@@ strac@@ t com@@ posi@@ tions ."
So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
"To give you a sense of scale , the largest pan@@ el is about two me@@ ters high ."
That &apos;s about this much . And the s@@ mal@@ l@@ est one is an A@@ 4 .
"So a vie@@ wer en@@ ters the space , and they s@@ na@@ p to at@@ ten@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) So here it ap@@ pe@@ ars as if it &apos;s the vie@@ wer that &apos;s sort of in@@ sti@@ g@@ ating the sense of order am@@ ong the pan@@ els , but it could also be the other way around , that the pan@@ els are so stu@@ ck within their pre@@ con@@ di@@ tion@@ ed behavi@@ ors that they sort of th@@ r@@ ust the vie@@ wer with the ro@@ le of a ty@@ r@@ ant ."
"So this br@@ ings me to a qu@@ ie@@ ter , small work called H@@ and@@ he@@ ld ."
So this in@@ st@@ ability in the movement very clo@@ se@@ ly re@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ les the un@@ ste@@ ady nature of images seen through a hand@@ he@@ ld cam@@ era .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two tan@@ dem cli@@ ps .
One is through a still cam@@ era and the other is through a hand@@ he@@ ld cam@@ era .
And you im@@ medi@@ ately see how the un@@ ste@@ ady nature of the video su@@ gg@@ est@@ s the pre@@ sen@@ ce of an obser@@ ver and a sub@@ je@@ ctive point of view .
So we &apos;ve just re@@ mo@@ ved the cam@@ era and trans@@ fer@@ red that movement on@@ to the pan@@ el .
So here &apos;s a video .
You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
That sort of li@@ k@@ ens it to the amount of stra@@ in to be at the ser@@ vice of the obser@@ ver and present this piece of pa@@ per very de@@ lic@@ ately to the vie@@ wer in front of them .
The next work is De@@ co@@ y .
"This is a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard model , so the obje@@ ct is about as t@@ all as I am ."
"It has a ro@@ un@@ ded body , two ar@@ ms , and a very t@@ all , he@@ ad@@ -@@ like an@@ ten@@ na , and its so@@ le pur@@ pos@@ e is to at@@ trac@@ t at@@ ten@@ tion towar@@ ds itself ."
"So when a vie@@ wer pas@@ ses by , it sort of ti@@ l@@ ts from side to side , and mo@@ ves its ar@@ ms more and more f@@ ran@@ ti@@ cally as the person gets clo@@ s@@ er ."
So here is the first test scen@@ ari@@ o .
( Laughter ) So this is the fin@@ al f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ated body of the De@@ co@@ y .
It ap@@ pe@@ ars to be mas@@ s@@ -@@ man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ red like it came out of a fac@@ t@@ ory like vac@@ u@@ um cle@@ an@@ ers and wa@@ sh@@ ing mach@@ ines .
"Because we are always working from a very per@@ s@@ onal space , we like how this con@@ sum@@ er a@@ es@@ the@@ tic sort of de@@ per@@ son@@ aliz@@ es the obje@@ ct and gi@@ ves us a bit of di@@ stance in its ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance , at least ."
"And so to us this is a kind of sin@@ ist@@ er being which is trying to di@@ strac@@ t you from the things that actually need your at@@ ten@@ tion , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help ."
"The next work is an obje@@ ct , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instru@@ ment ."
Se@@ ated in this audience are 9@@ 9@@ 6 small figu@@ res .
"So when the vie@@ wer ste@@ ps in front of the audience , there will be a respon@@ se ."
"So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as its own obje@@ ct or its own organi@@ sm that &apos;s also got a sort of musi@@ cal@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it , an instru@@ ment ."
"So the vie@@ wer can play it by e@@ li@@ ci@@ ting quite comple@@ x and v@@ ar@@ ied , nu@@ an@@ ced musi@@ cal or sound pat@@ ter@@ ns , but cannot really pro@@ vo@@ ke the audience into any particular kind of respon@@ se ."
It also has an al@@ lu@@ ring and tra@@ p@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it .
So we can &apos;t wa@@ it to be en@@ gu@@ l@@ f@@ ed by 9@@ 9@@ 6 of them .
"O@@ kay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the F@@ ra@@ mer@@ un@@ n@@ ers ."
It comes out of the idea of a win@@ do@@ w .
So we used the same win@@ do@@ w v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ lar@@ y to con@@ stru@@ ct our own fra@@ me or g@@ ri@@ d that &apos;s s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded in the room and that can be vie@@ w@@ ed from two si@@ des .
This g@@ ri@@ d is in@@ ha@@ bi@@ ted by a tri@@ be of small figu@@ res .
"They &apos;re also made up of three different si@@ z@@ es , as if to su@@ ggest a kind of perspe@@ ctive or land@@ s@@ cape on the single pla@@ in ."
"So we like the idea of these figu@@ res sort of sk@@ i@@ pping along like they &apos;re ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and car@@ ef@@ ree and happ@@ y@@ -@@ go@@ -@@ lu@@ ck@@ y and cont@@ ent , until they sort of sense a movement from the vie@@ wer and they will hi@@ de behind the f@@ ast@@ est w@@ all ."
"So to us , this work also pre@@ sen@@ ts its own con@@ tra@@ di@@ ction ."
So you see they ex@@ trac@@ ted the moti@@ on co@@ gs from our anim@@ ations and created a wi@@ gg@@ le that inte@@ gr@@ ated the he@@ ad@@ -@@ b@@ ob@@ b@@ ing movement and the back@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ for@@ th movement .
So it &apos;s really quite small .
You can see it can f@@ it into the pal@@ m of my hand .
"So imagine our exci@@ tem@@ ent when we saw it really working in the studi@@ o , and here it is ."
( Applause )
"So in colle@@ ge , I was a government major , which means I had to write a lot of pa@@ per@@ s ."
"Now , when a nor@@ mal stud@@ ent wri@@ tes a pa@@ per , they might sp@@ read the work out a little like this ."
"So , you know — ( Laughter ) you get started maybe a little s@@ low@@ ly , but you get enough done in the first week that , with some he@@ a@@ vie@@ r days later on , everything gets done , things st@@ ay ci@@ vi@@ l . ( Laughter )"
And I would want to do that like that .
That would be the pl@@ an .
"I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the pa@@ per would come along , and then I would kind of do this ."
( Laughter ) And that would happen every single pa@@ per .
"But then came my 9@@ 0-@@ p@@ age s@@ eni@@ or the@@ sis , a pa@@ per you &apos;re sup@@ posed to spend a year on ."
"And I knew for a pa@@ per like that , my nor@@ mal work f@@ low was not an op@@ tion ."
It was way too big a project .
"So I plan@@ ned things out , and I decided I kind of had to go something like this ."
This is how the year would go .
"So I &apos;d start off light , and I &apos;d bu@@ m@@ p it up in the mi@@ ddle months , and then at the end , I would ki@@ ck it up into high ge@@ ar just like a little sta@@ ir@@ case ."
How hard could it be to walk up the sta@@ ir@@ s ?
"No big deal , right ?"
"But then , the fun@@ nie@@ st thing happened ."
Th@@ ose first few months ?
"They came and went , and I couldn &apos;t quite do stuff ."
So we had an aw@@ es@@ ome new re@@ vi@@ sed pl@@ an .
"( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then those mi@@ ddle months actually went by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and so we were here ."
"And then two months turned into one mon@@ th , which turned into two weeks ."
"And one day I wo@@ ke up with three days until the de@@ ad@@ line , still not having wri@@ t@@ ten a word , and so I did the only thing I could : I wro@@ te 90 p@@ ages over 7@@ 2 hours , pul@@ ling not one but two al@@ l-@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters — hum@@ ans are not sup@@ posed to pu@@ ll two al@@ l-@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters — sp@@ r@@ in@@ ted across cam@@ pu@@ s , do@@ ve in s@@ low moti@@ on , and got it in just at the de@@ ad@@ line ."
I thought that was the end of everything .
"But a week later I get a call , and it &apos;s the school ."
"And they say , &quot; &quot; Is this T@@ im U@@ r@@ b@@ an ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; We need to talk about your the@@ sis . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; It &apos;s the best one we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That did not happen . ( Laughter )
"It was a very , very bad the@@ sis . ( Laughter )"
"I just wanted to en@@ jo@@ y that one moment when all of you thought , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )"
"No , no , it was very , very bad ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , today I &apos;m a wri@@ ter@@ -@@ blo@@ g@@ ger guy ."
I write the blo@@ g W@@ a@@ it But Why .
"And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation ."
"My behavi@@ or has always per@@ ple@@ x@@ ed the n@@ on-@@ pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors around me , and I wanted to expla@@ in to the n@@ on-@@ pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors of the world what goes on in the he@@ ads of pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors , and why we are the way we are ."
"Now , I had a hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis that the bra@@ ins of pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors were actually different than the bra@@ ins of other people ."
"And to test this , I found an M@@ R@@ I la@@ b that actually let me s@@ can both my brain and the brain of a pro@@ ven n@@ on-@@ pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator , so I could comp@@ are them ."
I actually brought them here to show you today .
I want you to take a look car@@ e@@ fully to see if you can noti@@ ce a difference .
"I know that if you &apos;re not a tra@@ ined brain exper@@ t , it &apos;s not that obvi@@ ous , but just take a look , OK ?"
So here &apos;s the brain of a n@@ on-@@ pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator .
( Laughter ) Now ...
here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) There is a difference .
"B@@ ot@@ h bra@@ ins have a R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ si@@ on-@@ M@@ ak@@ er in them , but the pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator &apos;s brain also has an In@@ st@@ ant G@@ r@@ ati@@ fi@@ cation M@@ on@@ key ."
"Now , what does this mean for the pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator ?"
"Well , it means everything &apos;s f@@ ine until this happens ."
"@@ &#91; This is a perfe@@ ct time to get some work done . &#93; &#91; N@@ op@@ e ! &#93; So the R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ si@@ on-@@ M@@ ak@@ er will make the r@@ ational deci@@ sion to do something produ@@ ctive , but the M@@ on@@ key doesn &apos;t like that pl@@ an , so he actually takes the whe@@ el , and he says , &quot; &quot; A@@ c@@ tually , let &apos;s read the entire Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ age of the N@@ an@@ cy K@@ er@@ ri@@ g@@ an / T@@ on@@ ya H@@ ar@@ ding sc@@ and@@ al , because I just re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed that that happened ."
"( Laughter ) Th@@ en — ( Laughter ) Th@@ en we &apos;re going to go over to the f@@ ri@@ dge , to see if there &apos;s anything new in there since 10 minutes ago ."
"A@@ f@@ ter that , we &apos;re going to go on a Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be spi@@ ral that star@@ ts with vi@@ de@@ os of Ri@@ ch@@ ard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man talking about mag@@ ne@@ ts and en@@ ds much , much later with us wat@@ ching inter@@ vie@@ ws with Ju@@ st@@ in B@@ ie@@ ber &apos;s mo@@ m ."
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; All of that &apos;s going to take a while , so we &apos;re not going to really have room on the s@@ che@@ du@@ le for any work today ."
"S@@ or@@ ry ! &quot; &quot; ( S@@ i@@ gh ) Now , what is going on here ?"
The In@@ st@@ ant G@@ r@@ ati@@ fi@@ cation M@@ on@@ key does not se@@ em like a guy you want behind the whe@@ el .
He lives enti@@ re@@ ly in the present moment .
"He has no memor@@ y of the past , no know@@ le@@ dge of the future , and he only car@@ es about two things : e@@ asy and fun ."
"Now , in the ani@@ mal world , that works f@@ ine ."
"If you &apos;re a do@@ g and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than e@@ asy and fun things , you &apos;re a huge suc@@ cess !"
"( Laughter ) And to the M@@ on@@ key , hum@@ ans are just another ani@@ mal species ."
"You have to keep wel@@ l-@@ s@@ lep@@ t , wel@@ l-@@ f@@ ed and pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ating into the next gener@@ ation , which in tri@@ b@@ al times might have worked OK ."
"But , if you ha@@ ven &apos;t noti@@ ced , now we &apos;re not in tri@@ b@@ al times ."
"We &apos;re in an adv@@ an@@ ced ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , and the M@@ on@@ key does not know what that is ."
"Wh@@ ich is why we have another guy in our brain , the R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ si@@ on-@@ M@@ ak@@ er , who gi@@ ves us the ability to do things no other ani@@ mal can do ."
We can vi@@ su@@ ali@@ ze the future .
We can see the big picture .
We can make lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m pl@@ ans .
And he wan@@ ts to take all of that into ac@@ coun@@ t .
And he wan@@ ts to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s an over@@ la@@ p .
S@@ ome@@ times they ag@@ ree .
"But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are har@@ der and less ple@@ as@@ ant , for the s@@ ake of the big picture ."
And that &apos;s when we have a con@@ fli@@ ct .
"And for the pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator , that con@@ fli@@ ct ten@@ ds to end a certain way every time , lea@@ ving him sp@@ ending a lot of time in this or@@ ange z@@ one , an e@@ asy and fun place that &apos;s enti@@ re@@ ly out of the M@@ ak@@ es S@@ en@@ se cir@@ cle ."
I call it the D@@ ar@@ k P@@ la@@ y@@ ground .
"( Laughter ) Now , the D@@ ar@@ k P@@ la@@ y@@ ground is a place that all of you pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors out there know very well ."
It &apos;s where le@@ i@@ sure acti@@ vi@@ ties happen at times when le@@ i@@ sure acti@@ vi@@ ties are not sup@@ posed to be happening .
"The fun you have in the D@@ ar@@ k P@@ la@@ y@@ ground isn &apos;t actually fun , because it &apos;s completely u@@ ne@@ ar@@ ned , and the air is fil@@ led with gu@@ il@@ t , dre@@ ad , an@@ x@@ ie@@ ty , self-@@ h@@ at@@ red — all of those good pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator feel@@ ings ."
"And the question is , in this situ@@ ation , with the M@@ on@@ key behind the whe@@ el , how does the pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator ever get hi@@ m@@ self over here to this blue z@@ one , a less ple@@ as@@ ant place , but where really important things happen ?"
"Well , turns out the pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator has a gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an ang@@ el , someone who &apos;s always looking down on him and wat@@ ching over him in his dar@@ k@@ est mom@@ ents — someone called the P@@ ani@@ c M@@ on@@ ster ."
"( Laughter ) Now , the P@@ ani@@ c M@@ on@@ ster is d@@ or@@ m@@ ant most of the time , but he sud@@ den@@ ly wa@@ k@@ es up any@@ time a de@@ ad@@ line gets too close or there &apos;s d@@ ang@@ er of public em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ ment , a car@@ e@@ er disa@@ ster or some other sc@@ ary con@@ sequ@@ ence ."
"And import@@ an@@ tly , he &apos;s the only thing the M@@ on@@ key is terri@@ f@@ ied of ."
"Now , he became very rele@@ v@@ ant in my life pretty re@@ cent@@ ly , because the people of TED re@@ ach@@ ed out to me about six months ago and in@@ vi@@ ted me to do a TED T@@ al@@ k ."
"( Laughter ) Now , of course , I said y@@ es ."
It &apos;s always been a dre@@ am of m@@ ine to have done a TED T@@ al@@ k in the past .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the mi@@ ddle of all this exci@@ tem@@ ent , the R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ si@@ on-@@ M@@ ak@@ er seem@@ ed to have something else on his mind ."
"He was saying , &quot; &quot; A@@ re we clear on what we just ac@@ cep@@ ted ?"
Do we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
"We need to si@@ t down and work on this right now . &quot; &quot; And the M@@ on@@ key said , &quot; &quot; T@@ ot@@ ally ag@@ ree , but let &apos;s just open Go@@ og@@ le Earth and z@@ o@@ om in to the bot@@ tom of Indi@@ a , like 2@@ 00 fe@@ et ab@@ o@@ ve the ground , and sc@@ ro@@ ll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country , so we can get a better feel for Indi@@ a . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what we did that day . ( Laughter )"
"As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to rele@@ ase the spe@@ ak@@ ers ."
"And I open@@ ed up the we@@ b@@ site , and there was my face star@@ ing right back at me ."
And gu@@ ess who wo@@ ke up ?
"( Laughter ) So the P@@ ani@@ c M@@ on@@ ster star@@ ts lo@@ sing his mind , and a few secon@@ ds later , the whole system &apos;s in ma@@ y@@ h@@ em . ( Laughter )"
"And the M@@ on@@ key — remember , he &apos;s terri@@ f@@ ied of the P@@ ani@@ c M@@ on@@ ster — bo@@ om , he &apos;s up the t@@ ree !"
"And finally , finally , the R@@ ational De@@ ci@@ si@@ on-@@ M@@ ak@@ er can take the whe@@ el and I can start working on the talk ."
"Now , the P@@ ani@@ c M@@ on@@ ster expla@@ ins all kinds of pretty in@@ s@@ ane pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator behavi@@ or , like how someone like me could spend two weeks u@@ na@@ ble to start the open@@ ing s@@ ent@@ ence of a pa@@ per , and then mi@@ rac@@ ul@@ ously find the un@@ belie@@ v@@ able work e@@ th@@ ic to st@@ ay up all night and write eight p@@ ages ."
"And this entire situ@@ ation , with the three char@@ ac@@ ters — this is the pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator &apos;s system ."
"It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works ."
This is what I decided to write about on the blo@@ g a couple of years ago .
"When I did , I was amaz@@ ed by the respon@@ se ."
"L@@ i@@ ter@@ ally thousands of e@@ ma@@ il@@ s came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things ."
"These are people who were n@@ ur@@ ses , ban@@ k@@ ers , pa@@ inter@@ s , engine@@ ers and lots and lots of P@@ h@@ D students ."
"( Laughter ) And they were all writing , saying the same thing : &quot; I have this problem too . &quot;"
But what stru@@ ck me was the con@@ tra@@ st between the light t@@ one of the pos@@ t and the he@@ av@@ iness of these e@@ ma@@ il@@ s .
"These people were writing with inten@@ se f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation about what pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation had done to their lives , about what this M@@ on@@ key had done to them ."
"And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?"
Why are all of these people in such a dar@@ k place ?
"Well , it turns out that there &apos;s two kinds of pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation ."
"E@@ very@@ thing I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about today , the exam@@ ples I &apos;ve given , they all have de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es ."
"And when there &apos;s de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es , the effe@@ cts of pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation are con@@ ta@@ ined to the shor@@ t ter@@ m because the P@@ ani@@ c M@@ on@@ ster gets inv@@ olved ."
But there &apos;s a second kind of pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation that happens in situ@@ ations when there is no de@@ ad@@ line .
"There &apos;s also all kinds of important things outside of your car@@ e@@ er that don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve any de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es , like seeing your family or ex@@ er@@ ci@@ sing and taking care of your health , working on your relation@@ ship or getting out of a relation@@ ship that isn &apos;t working ."
"Now if the pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ator &apos;s only mechani@@ sm of doing these hard things is the P@@ ani@@ c M@@ on@@ ster , that &apos;s a problem , because in all of these n@@ on-@@ de@@ ad@@ line situ@@ ations , the P@@ ani@@ c M@@ on@@ ster doesn &apos;t show up ."
"He has nothing to wa@@ ke up for , so the effe@@ cts of pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation , they &apos;re not con@@ ta@@ ined ; they just ex@@ ten@@ d ou@@ tw@@ ard fore@@ ver ."
"And it &apos;s this lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m kind of pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation that &apos;s much less visi@@ ble and much less tal@@ ked about than the fun@@ nie@@ r , shor@@ t-@@ ter@@ m de@@ ad@@ lin@@ e-@@ based kind ."
It &apos;s usu@@ ally su@@ f@@ fer@@ ed qu@@ ie@@ tly and pri@@ v@@ ately .
"And it can be the source of a huge amount of lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m un@@ happ@@ iness , and re@@ gre@@ ts ."
"And I thought , that &apos;s why those people are e@@ ma@@ il@@ ing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place ."
It &apos;s not that they &apos;re c@@ ra@@ m@@ ming for some project .
"It &apos;s that lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation has made them feel like a spe@@ ct@@ ator , at times , in their own lives ."
The f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation is not that they couldn &apos;t ach@@ ie@@ ve their dre@@ am@@ s ; it &apos;s that they wer@@ en &apos;t even able to start ch@@ as@@ ing them .
So I read these e@@ ma@@ il@@ s and I had a little bit of an epi@@ ph@@ any — that I don &apos;t think n@@ on-@@ pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors exi@@ st .
That &apos;s right — I think all of you are pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors .
"Now , you might not all be a m@@ ess , like some of us , ( Laughter ) and some of you may have a health@@ y relation@@ ship with de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es , but remember : the M@@ on@@ key &apos;s s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ie@@ st tri@@ ck is when the de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es ar@@ en &apos;t there ."
"Now , I want to show you one last thing ."
I call this a Li@@ fe C@@ al@@ en@@ d@@ ar .
That &apos;s one box for every week of a 9@@ 0-@@ year life .
"That &apos;s not that many bo@@ x@@ es , es@@ pe@@ cially since we &apos;ve already used a bu@@ n@@ ch of those ."
"So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that cal@@ en@@ d@@ ar ."
"We need to think about what we &apos;re really pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ating on , because everyone is pro@@ c@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ating on something in life ."
We need to st@@ ay aw@@ are of the In@@ st@@ ant G@@ r@@ ati@@ fi@@ cation M@@ on@@ key .
That &apos;s a job for all of us .
"And because there &apos;s not that many bo@@ x@@ es on there , it &apos;s a job that should probably start today ."
"Well , maybe not today , but ..."
( Laughter ) You know .
S@@ ome@@ time so@@ on .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"There &apos;s a man by the name of C@@ ap@@ tain W@@ il@@ li@@ am S@@ wen@@ son who re@@ cent@@ ly was aw@@ ar@@ ded the con@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ onal M@@ ed@@ al of H@@ on@@ or for his ac@@ tions on Se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 8 , 200@@ 9 ."
"O@@ n that day , a col@@ um@@ n of American and Af@@ gh@@ an tro@@ op@@ s were making their way through a part of Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan to help prote@@ ct a group of government offi@@ ci@@ als , a group of Af@@ gh@@ an government offi@@ ci@@ als , who would be me@@ e@@ ting with some local vi@@ ll@@ age el@@ ders ."
"One of the people he re@@ s@@ cu@@ ed was a ser@@ ge@@ ant , and he and a com@@ ra@@ de were making their way to a me@@ de@@ v@@ a@@ c he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter ."
"And what was re@@ mark@@ able about this day is , by sh@@ e@@ er co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence , one of the me@@ de@@ v@@ a@@ c medi@@ cs happened to have a Go@@ P@@ r@@ o cam@@ era on his hel@@ met and cap@@ tu@@ red the whole scen@@ e on cam@@ era ."
It shows C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ wen@@ son and his com@@ ra@@ de br@@ ing@@ ing this w@@ oun@@ ded sol@@ d@@ ier who had re@@ cei@@ ved a g@@ un@@ sh@@ ot to the ne@@ ck .
"They put him in the he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter , and then you see C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ wen@@ son b@@ end over and give him a k@@ is@@ s before he turns around to re@@ s@@ cu@@ e more ."
"I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?"
"What is that ? That is some de@@ ep , de@@ ep emoti@@ on , when you would want to do that ."
"There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?"
"You know , in the mi@@ lit@@ ary , they give me@@ d@@ als to people who are wil@@ ling to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce themselves so that others may ga@@ in ."
"In business , we give b@@ on@@ uses to people who are wil@@ ling to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce others so that we may ga@@ in ."
We have it back@@ war@@ ds . R@@ ight ?
"So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?"
And my ini@@ tial con@@ clu@@ sion was that they &apos;re just better people .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re at@@ trac@@ ted to the mi@@ lit@@ ary .
These better people are at@@ trac@@ ted to this con@@ cept of ser@@ vice .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
"What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the ca@@ pac@@ ity to do these re@@ mark@@ able things , and more import@@ an@@ tly , others have that ca@@ pac@@ ity too ."
"I &apos;ve had the great hon@@ or of getting to me@@ et some of these , who we would call her@@ o@@ es , who have put themselves and put their lives at ri@@ sk to sa@@ ve others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?"
Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s this de@@ ep sense of tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation .
So tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation are really important here .
"The problem with con@@ cep@@ ts of tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation is that they are feel@@ ings , they are not instru@@ ctions ."
"I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; T@@ r@@ ust me , &quot; &quot; and you will ."
"I can &apos;t simply instru@@ ct two people to co@@ oper@@ ate , and they will ."
It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
So where does that feeling come from ?
"If you go back 5@@ 0,000 years to the P@@ ale@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic era , to the early days of H@@ om@@ o sa@@ pie@@ ns , what we find is that the world was fil@@ led with d@@ ang@@ er , all of these for@@ ces working very , very hard to ki@@ ll us ."
N@@ o@@ thing per@@ s@@ onal .
"W@@ he@@ ther it was the we@@ a@@ ther , l@@ ack of re@@ sources , maybe a s@@ ab@@ er@@ -@@ to@@ o@@ the@@ d ti@@ ger , all of these things working to redu@@ ce our li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an ."
"And so we ev@@ olved into social animals , where we li@@ ved together and worked together in what I call a cir@@ cle of sa@@ fe@@ ty , inside the tri@@ be , where we felt like we be@@ lon@@ g@@ ed ."
"And when we felt sa@@ fe am@@ on@@ g@@ st our own , the natural re@@ action was tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation ."
There are in@@ her@@ ent b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts to this .
It means I can f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep at night and tr@@ ust that someone from within my tri@@ be will wat@@ ch for d@@ ang@@ er .
"If we don &apos;t tr@@ ust each other , if I don &apos;t tr@@ ust you , that means you won &apos;t wat@@ ch for d@@ ang@@ er ."
B@@ ad system of survi@@ v@@ al .
The moder@@ n day is exactly the same thing .
"The world is fil@@ led with d@@ ang@@ er , things that are trying to f@@ ru@@ str@@ ate our lives or redu@@ ce our suc@@ cess , redu@@ ce our opportunity for suc@@ cess ."
"It could be the u@@ ps and dow@@ ns in the econom@@ y , the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of the sto@@ ck market ."
It could be a new technology that ren@@ ders your business model ob@@ so@@ le@@ te over@@ night .
O@@ r it could be your compe@@ ti@@ tion that is sometimes trying to ki@@ ll you .
"It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very min@@ i@@ mu@@ m is working hard to f@@ ru@@ str@@ ate your grow@@ th and ste@@ al your business from you ."
We have no control over these for@@ ces .
"These are a con@@ st@@ ant , and they &apos;re not going away ."
"The only v@@ ari@@ able are the con@@ di@@ tions inside the organiz@@ ation , and that &apos;s where le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship mat@@ ters , because it &apos;s the lea@@ der that se@@ ts the t@@ one ."
"When a lea@@ der makes the cho@@ ice to put the sa@@ fe@@ ty and lives of the people inside the organiz@@ ation first , to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce their comfor@@ ts and s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce the tan@@ gi@@ ble resul@@ ts , so that the people re@@ ma@@ in and feel sa@@ fe and feel like they be@@ long , re@@ mark@@ able things happen ."
"I was fl@@ ying on a tri@@ p , and I was wit@@ ness to an in@@ ci@@ dent where a pas@@ sen@@ ger at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted to bo@@ ard before their number was called , and I wat@@ ched the g@@ ate ag@@ ent tre@@ at this man like he had bro@@ k@@ en the la@@ w , like a cri@@ min@@ al ."
He was y@@ el@@ led at for at@@ tem@@ p@@ ting to bo@@ ard one group too so@@ on .
So I said something .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have tre@@ at us like cat@@ tle ?"
Why can &apos;t you tre@@ at us like human be@@ ings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ ir , if I don &apos;t fol@@ low the ru@@ les , I could get in t@@ rou@@ ble or lo@@ se my job . &quot; &quot; All she was tel@@ ling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel sa@@ fe . All she was tel@@ ling me is th@@ at@@ "
she doesn &apos;t tr@@ ust her le@@ ad@@ ers .
The reason we like fl@@ ying S@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ir@@ lin@@ es is not because they ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly hi@@ re better people .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fe@@ ar their le@@ ad@@ ers .
"You see , if the con@@ di@@ tions are wrong , we are for@@ ced to ex@@ p@@ end our own time and energy to prote@@ ct ourselves from each other , and that in@@ her@@ ently we@@ ak@@ ens the organiz@@ ation ."
"When we feel sa@@ fe inside the organiz@@ ation , we will natur@@ ally com@@ b@@ ine our tal@@ ents and our str@@ eng@@ ths and work ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly to face the d@@ ang@@ ers outside and se@@ i@@ ze the opportuni@@ ties ."
"The clo@@ s@@ est an@@ al@@ og@@ y I can give to what a great lea@@ der is , is like being a par@@ ent ."
"If you think about what being a great par@@ ent is , what do you want ? What makes a great par@@ ent ?"
"We want to give our child opportuni@@ ties , education , dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine them when ne@@ cess@@ ary , all so that they can gro@@ w up and ach@@ ie@@ ve more than we could for ourselves ."
Gre@@ at le@@ ad@@ ers want exactly the same thing .
"They want to provi@@ de their people opportunity , education , dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine when ne@@ cess@@ ary , build their self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dence , give them the opportunity to try and fa@@ il , all so that they could ach@@ ie@@ ve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves ."
"Ch@@ ar@@ lie K@@ im , who &apos;s the C@@ E@@ O of a company called N@@ ex@@ t J@@ um@@ p in New York C@@ ity , a te@@ ch company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consi@@ der la@@ ying off one of your children ?"
We would never do it .
Th@@ en why do we consi@@ der la@@ ying off people inside our organiz@@ ation ?
Ch@@ ar@@ lie im@@ ple@@ men@@ ted a poli@@ cy of li@@ fe@@ time em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment .
"If you get a job at N@@ ex@@ t J@@ um@@ p , you cannot get fi@@ red for perform@@ ance issu@@ es ."
"In fact , if you have issu@@ es , they will co@@ ach you and they will give you sup@@ port , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school ."
It &apos;s the comple@@ te op@@ posi@@ te .
"This is the reason so many people have such a vi@@ sc@@ er@@ al h@@ at@@ red , ang@@ er , at some of these ban@@ king C@@ E@@ O@@ s with their dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies and b@@ on@@ us stru@@ ctures ."
It &apos;s not the num@@ bers .
It &apos;s that they have viol@@ ated the very defini@@ tion of le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship .
They have viol@@ ated this de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ se@@ ated social con@@ trac@@ t .
"We know that they allow@@ ed their people to be s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ced so they could prote@@ ct their own interest@@ s , or wor@@ se , they s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ced their people to prote@@ ct their own interest@@ s ."
"This is what so of@@ f@@ en@@ ds us , not the num@@ bers ."
W@@ ould any@@ body be of@@ f@@ en@@ ded if we gave a $ 1@@ 50 million b@@ on@@ us to G@@ and@@ h@@ i ?
How about a $ 2@@ 50 million b@@ on@@ us to M@@ other T@@ er@@ es@@ a ?
Do we have an issue with that ? N@@ one at all . N@@ one at all .
Gre@@ at le@@ ad@@ ers would never s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce
the people to sa@@ ve the num@@ bers .
They would so@@ on@@ er s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce the num@@ bers to sa@@ ve the people .
"B@@ o@@ b C@@ ha@@ p@@ man , who ru@@ ns a large man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing company in the Mi@@ dw@@ est called Bar@@ ry@@ -@@ W@@ e@@ h@@ mi@@ l@@ ler , in 200@@ 8 was h@@ it very hard by the re@@ ces@@ sion , and they lost 30 percent of their or@@ ders over@@ night ."
"Now in a large man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer af@@ for@@ d their lab@@ or po@@ ol ."
"They needed to sa@@ ve 10 million dollars , so , like so many comp@@ an@@ ies today , the bo@@ ard got together and di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed la@@ y@@ of@@ f@@ s ."
And Bo@@ b ref@@ used .
"You see , Bo@@ b doesn &apos;t believe in head coun@@ ts ."
"B@@ o@@ b belie@@ ves in heart coun@@ ts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply redu@@ ce the heart coun@@ t ."
And so they came up with a f@@ ur@@ l@@ ough program .
"E@@ very em@@ plo@@ ye@@ e , from se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary to C@@ E@@ O , was requi@@ red to take four weeks of un@@ pa@@ id vac@@ ation ."
"They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it con@@ secu@@ ti@@ vely ."
But it was how Bo@@ b an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced the program that mat@@ ter@@ ed so much .
"He said , it &apos;s better that we should all su@@ f@@ f@@ er a little than any of us should have to su@@ f@@ f@@ er a lot , and mor@@ ale went up ."
"They sa@@ ved 20 million dollars , and most import@@ an@@ tly , as would be expe@@ cted , when the people feel sa@@ fe and prote@@ cted by the le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship in the organiz@@ ation , the natural re@@ action is to tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ate ."
"And quite spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously , no@@ body expe@@ cted , people started tra@@ ding with each other ."
Th@@ ose who could af@@ for@@ d it more would tra@@ de with those who could af@@ for@@ d it less .
Pe@@ ople would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
Le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship is a cho@@ ice . It is not a ran@@ k .
I know many people at the s@@ eni@@ or@@ most le@@ v@@ els of organiz@@ ations who are absolu@@ tely not le@@ ad@@ ers .
"They are au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ies , and we do what they say because they have au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty over us , but we would not fol@@ low them ."
"And I know many people who are at the bot@@ tom@@ s of organiz@@ ations who have no au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty and they are absolu@@ tely le@@ ad@@ ers , and this is because they have cho@@ s@@ en to look after the person to the left of them , and they have cho@@ s@@ en to look after the person to the right of them ."
This is what a lea@@ der is .
"I heard a story of some Mar@@ ines who were out in the@@ ater , and as is the Mar@@ ine cu@@ st@@ om , the offi@@ cer ate last , and he let his men e@@ at first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him ."
"And when they went back out in the fie@@ ld , his men brought him some of their food so that he may e@@ at , because that &apos;s what happens ."
We call them le@@ ad@@ ers because they go first .
We call them le@@ ad@@ ers because they take the ri@@ sk before any@@ body else does .
"We call them le@@ ad@@ ers because they will cho@@ ose to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce so that their people may be sa@@ fe and prote@@ cted and so their people may ga@@ in , and when we do , the natural respon@@ se is that our people will s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce for us ."
"They will give us their blo@@ od and s@@ we@@ at and te@@ ars to see that their lea@@ der &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?"
Why would you give your blo@@ od and s@@ we@@ at and te@@ ars for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
And isn &apos;t that the organiz@@ ation we would all like to work in ?

That is how I gre@@ w up : en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to see be@@ y@@ ond any li@@ mi@@ tation .

"D@@ ur@@ ing those tri@@ ps , my grand@@ mother used to re@@ ci@@ te a K@@ i@@ pl@@ ing po@@ em : &quot; &quot; S@@ ome@@ thing hi@@ d@@ den . G@@ o and find it ."
G@@ o and look behind the M@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins .
S@@ ome@@ thing lost behind the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins .
"L@@ o@@ st and wai@@ ting for you . G@@ o ! &quot; &quot; In the coming years , I became a medi@@ cal stud@@ ent ."
One of every hundre@@ d children born wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de has some kind of heart dise@@ ase .
There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can sol@@ ve — the part of this problem I have spent my life working on .
The problem star@@ ts during pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy .
The fe@@ tu@@ s needs to survi@@ ve inside the mother .
S@@ ur@@ vi@@ v@@ al depen@@ ds on communi@@ cation between the syst@@ e@@ mi@@ c and the pul@@ mon@@ ary blo@@ od .
"A@@ t the moment of bir@@ th , this communi@@ cation needs to stop ."
"If it doesn &apos;t close , the b@@ aby has a ho@@ le in the heart ."
It is ca@@ used by pre@@ mat@@ u@@ ri@@ ty and gen@@ e@@ tic con@@ di@@ tions .
But what we know today is that a l@@ ack of o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en is also one of the ca@@ uses .
"@@ V@@ ide@@ o : ( B@@ aby c@@ ry@@ ing ) When you look at patients with this con@@ di@@ tion , they se@@ em des@@ per@@ ate to bre@@ a@@ the ."
"To close the ho@@ le , major sur@@ g@@ ery used to be the only solution ."
"One night , my friend M@@ al@@ te , were cam@@ ping in the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on regi@@ on ."
The only thing that would not bur@@ n in the fi@@ re was a green av@@ o@@ ca@@ do bran@@ ch .
Th@@ en came a moment of in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation .
So we used the bran@@ ch as a mo@@ ld for our first inv@@ en@@ tion .
The ho@@ les in children &apos;s hear@@ ts can be clo@@ sed with it .
A co@@ il is a piece of wi@@ re w@@ ra@@ pped on@@ to itself .
"It maybe doesn &apos;t look so fan@@ cy to you now , but that was our first suc@@ cess@@ ful at@@ tem@@ pt to create a de@@ vice for this major problem ."
"In this video , we can see how a very t@@ iny ca@@ the@@ ter takes the co@@ il to the heart ."
The co@@ il then clo@@ ses the ho@@ le .
"A@@ f@@ ter that moment of in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation , there came a very long time of ef@@ for@@ t develo@@ ping a pro@@ t@@ oty@@ pe ."
In vi@@ tr@@ o and in vi@@ v@@ o stud@@ ies took thousands of hours of work in the la@@ b .
"The co@@ il , if it works , can sa@@ ve lives ."
"I re@@ turned from G@@ er@@ many to Bo@@ li@@ vi@@ a , thinking that wh@@ er@@ ever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference ."
"A@@ f@@ ter suc@@ cess@@ fully tre@@ ating patients with our co@@ il , we felt really en@@ th@@ usi@@ a@@ stic ."
"But we live in a place that is 1@@ 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et high ."
"And , the patients there need a spe@@ cial de@@ vice to sol@@ ve their heart con@@ di@@ tion ."
"The ho@@ le in al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de patients is different , because the ori@@ fi@@ ce between the ar@@ ter@@ ies is lar@@ ger ."
"Mo@@ st patients cannot af@@ for@@ d to be tre@@ ated on time , and they die ."
The first co@@ il could suc@@ cess@@ fully tre@@ at only half of the patients in Bo@@ li@@ vi@@ a .
The sear@@ ch started again .
We went back to the d@@ raw@@ ing bo@@ ard .
"A@@ f@@ ter many tri@@ als , and with the help of my grand@@ mother &apos;s indi@@ gen@@ ous friends in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins , we ob@@ ta@@ ined a new de@@ vice ."
We take this tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal meth@@ od of we@@ a@@ ving and make a design made by a s@@ mar@@ t materi@@ al that recor@@ ds sha@@ pe .
"It seem@@ s this time , the we@@ a@@ ving allow@@ s us to create a se@@ am@@ less de@@ vice that doesn &apos;t r@@ ust because it &apos;s made of only one piece ."
It can change by itself into very comple@@ x stru@@ ctures by a pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re that took de@@ ca@@ des to develo@@ p .
"As you can see , the de@@ vice en@@ ters the body through the natural ch@@ an@@ ne@@ ls ."
D@@ o@@ ct@@ ors have only to close the ca@@ the@@ ter through the ho@@ le .
"O@@ ur de@@ vice ex@@ p@@ ands , places itself and clo@@ ses the ho@@ le ."
We have this beautiful deli@@ very system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .
No open sur@@ g@@ ery was ne@@ cess@@ ary .
"( Applause ) A@@ s do@@ ct@@ ors , we fi@@ ght with dise@@ ases that take a long time and ef@@ for@@ t to he@@ al — if they do ."
"This is the child from before , after the pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re ."
"As you can see — ( Applause ) A@@ s you can see , once the de@@ vice is in place , the patien@@ t is 100 percent heal@@ ed ."
That &apos;s very re@@ war@@ ding from the medi@@ cal and human point of view .
"T@@ og@@ e@@ ther , we have only one idea : the best solu@@ tions need to be simple ."
We lost the fe@@ ar of cre@@ ating something new .
"The pat@@ h , it &apos;s not e@@ asy ."
M@@ any ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les ari@@ se all the time .
But we re@@ cei@@ ve str@@ eng@@ th from our patients .
Th@@ e@@ ir re@@ sil@@ ience and cou@@ ra@@ ge inspi@@ re our cre@@ ati@@ vity .
"O@@ ur go@@ al is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or ac@@ cess ."
So we have to start a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation with a one@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ one model .
We will give one de@@ vice for f@@ ree to make sure that every child is tre@@ ated .
"We are in many countries now , but we need to be every@@ where ."

"So I gre@@ w up in L@@ im@@ po@@ po , on the bor@@ der of L@@ im@@ po@@ po and M@@ pu@@ mal@@ ang@@ a , a little tow@@ n called M@@ ot@@ e@@ te@@ ma ."
"W@@ ater and electri@@ city su@@ pp@@ ly are as un@@ pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able as the we@@ a@@ ther , and grow@@ ing up in these t@@ ough situ@@ ations , at the age of 1@@ 7 , I was re@@ la@@ x@@ ing with a couple of friends of m@@ ine in win@@ ter , and we were su@@ n@@ ba@@ thing ."
The L@@ im@@ po@@ po su@@ n gets really ho@@ t in win@@ ter .
"So as we were su@@ n@@ ba@@ thing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , why doesn &apos;t somebody inv@@ ent something that you can just put on your sk@@ in and then you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ? &quot; &quot; And I s@@ at , and I was like , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , I would bu@@ y that , e@@ h ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very sh@@ oc@@ king st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs ."
O@@ ver 2@@ .@@ 5 billion people in the world today do not have pro@@ per ac@@ cess to water and s@@ ani@@ tation .
"F@@ our hundre@@ d and fi@@ f@@ ty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in S@@ outh Africa ."
"@@ V@@ ari@@ ous dise@@ ases th@@ ri@@ ve in this environment , the most dra@@ stic of which is called tr@@ ach@@ om@@ a ."
T@@ rac@@ hom@@ a is an in@@ fe@@ ction of the ey@@ e du@@ e to di@@ r@@ t getting into your ey@@ e . M@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple in@@ fe@@ ctions of tr@@ ach@@ om@@ a can leave you per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ ind .

"So after seeing these sh@@ oc@@ king st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cs , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to ba@@ the , I at least need to do it to try to sa@@ ve the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my tru@@ sty little ste@@ ed , my N@@ o@@ ki@@ a 6@@ 2@@ 3@@ 4 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a lap@@ top , I didn &apos;t have Inter@@ net much , ex@@ cept for the 20@@ -@@ ran@@ d-@@ an@@ -@@ hour Inter@@ net ca@@ fe — I did research on Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a , on Go@@ og@@ le , about l@@ oti@@ ons , cre@@ am@@ s , the com@@ posi@@ tions , the me@@ l@@ ting poin@@ ts , the to@@ x@@ i@@ cities — I did high school science — and I wro@@ te down a little for@@ mu@@ la on a piece of pa@@ per ,"
"@@ and it looked like the K@@ F@@ C spe@@ cial spi@@ ce , you know ?"
"So I was like , o@@ kay , so we &apos;ve got the for@@ mu@@ la ready ."
Now we need to get this thing into prac@@ ti@@ ce .
"F@@ ast forward four years later , after having wri@@ t@@ ten a 4@@ 0-@@ p@@ age business pl@@ an on the cell phone , having wri@@ t@@ ten my pat@@ ent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youn@@ gest pat@@ ent@@ -@@ hol@@ der in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more ba@@ thing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that .

"You liter@@ ally put it on your sk@@ in , and you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ."
"( Laughter ) So after having tr@@ ied to make it work in high school with the li@@ mi@@ ted re@@ sources I had , I went to uni@@ versity , met a few people , got it into prac@@ ti@@ ce , and we have a fully fun@@ cti@@ on@@ ing produ@@ ct that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually available on the market ."
So we learned a few l@@ ess@@ ons in comm@@ er@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ing and making D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath available .
One of the things we learned was that po@@ or communi@@ ties don &apos;t bu@@ y produ@@ cts in bu@@ l@@ k .
"They bu@@ y produ@@ cts on de@@ m@@ and . A person in A@@ le@@ x doesn &apos;t bu@@ y a box of ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes . They bu@@ y one ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te each day , even though it &apos;s more ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
So we pac@@ k@@ aged D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath in these in@@ no@@ v@@ ative little s@@ ac@@ he@@ ts .
"You just s@@ na@@ p them in half , and you squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze it out ."
"And the cool part is , one s@@ ach@@ et sub@@ stitu@@ tes one b@@ ath for five r@@ and ."
"A@@ f@@ ter cre@@ ating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of im@@ ple@@ ment@@ ing the produ@@ ct ."
We realized that even ri@@ ch kids from the su@@ bur@@ b@@ s really want D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath . ( Laughter ) A@@ t least once a week .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , we realized that we could sa@@ ve 80 million li@@ ters of water on a@@ ver@@ age each time they sk@@ i@@ pped a b@@ ath , and also we would sa@@ ve two hours a day for kids who are in ru@@ ral are@@ as , two hours more for school , two hours more for h@@ ome@@ work , two hours more to just be a kid ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seeing that global impac@@ t , we nar@@ row@@ ed it down to our key val@@ ue pro@@ posi@@ tion , which was cle@@ an@@ lin@@ ess and con@@ ven@@ ience ."
D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath is a ri@@ ch man &apos;s con@@ ven@@ ience and a po@@ or man &apos;s li@@ f@@ es@@ a@@ ver .
"H@@ a@@ ving put the produ@@ ct into prac@@ ti@@ ce , we are actually now on the ver@@ ge of sel@@ ling the produ@@ ct on@@ to a mul@@ t@@ in@@ ational to take it to the re@@ ta@@ il market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the gra@@ vel ro@@ ads of L@@ im@@ po@@ po , with an allow@@ ance of 50 r@@ and a week , I came up with a way for the world not to ba@@ the ."
What &apos;s stop@@ ping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
"And another key thing that I learned a lot throu@@ gh@@ out this whole process , last year Go@@ og@@ le na@@ med me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young min@@ ds in the world ."
"I &apos;m also cur@@ r@@ ently the best stud@@ ent ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur in the world , the first Afri@@ can to get that ac@@ col@@ ade , and one thing that really pu@@ z@@ z@@ les me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to ba@@ the . Thank you ."

"F@@ i@@ ve years ago , I was on a s@@ ab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal , and I re@@ turned to the medi@@ cal uni@@ versity where I stud@@ ied ."
"I saw real patients and I wor@@ e the white co@@ at for the first time in 1@@ 7 years , in fact since I became a man@@ ag@@ ement con@@ sul@@ t@@ ant ."
There were two things that sur@@ pri@@ sed me during the mon@@ th I spent .
"The first one was that the common the@@ me of the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions we had were ho@@ spit@@ al bud@@ gets and co@@ st@@ -@@ cu@@ tting , and the second thing , which really bo@@ ther@@ ed me , actually , was that se@@ ver@@ al of the colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es I met , form@@ er friends from medi@@ cal school , who I knew to be some of the s@@ mar@@ test , most moti@@ v@@ ated , eng@@ aged and pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cy@@ ni@@ cal , di@@ sen@@ g@@ aged , or had di@@ stan@@ ced themselves from ho@@ spit@@ al man@@ ag@@ ement ."
"So with this fo@@ cus on co@@ st@@ -@@ cu@@ tting , I asked myself , are we for@@ getting the patien@@ t ?"
M@@ any countries that you re@@ present and where I come from stru@@ gg@@ le with the cost of health@@ care .
It &apos;s a big part of the national bud@@ gets .
And many different re@@ form@@ s a@@ im at hol@@ ding back this grow@@ th .
"In some countries , we have long wai@@ ting times for patients for sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"In other countries , new dru@@ gs are not being re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , and ther@@ e@@ fore don &apos;t re@@ ach patients ."
"In se@@ ver@@ al countries , do@@ ct@@ ors and n@@ ur@@ ses are the tar@@ gets , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , for the govern@@ ments ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , the co@@ st@@ ly deci@@ sions in health care are taken by do@@ ct@@ ors and n@@ ur@@ ses ."
"You cho@@ ose an ex@@ pen@@ sive la@@ b test , you cho@@ ose to oper@@ ate on an old and fra@@ il patien@@ t ."
"So , by li@@ mi@@ ting the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom of physi@@ ci@@ ans , this is a way to h@@ old co@@ sts down ."
"And ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , some physi@@ ci@@ ans will say today that they don &apos;t have the full li@@ ber@@ ty to make the cho@@ i@@ ces they think are right for their patients ."
So no won@@ der that some of my old colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es are f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated .
"And so we took a ste@@ p back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to ach@@ ie@@ ve ? &quot;"
"U@@ l@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , in the health@@ care system , we &apos;re a@@ im@@ ing at impro@@ ving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a li@@ mi@@ ted , or af@@ for@@ d@@ able , cost ."
We call this val@@ u@@ e-@@ based health@@ care .
"O@@ n the scre@@ en behind me , you see what we mean by val@@ ue : out@@ comes that matter to patients rel@@ ative to the money we spend ."
This was descri@@ bed beauti@@ fully in a book in 200@@ 6 by Mi@@ cha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter and E@@ li@@ za@@ be@@ th T@@ e@@ is@@ ber@@ g .
"O@@ n this picture , you have my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by his three beautiful d@@ augh@@ ters ."
"When we started doing our research at B@@ C@@ G , we decided not to look so much at the co@@ sts , but to look at the qu@@ ality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fas@@ cin@@ ated us was the v@@ ari@@ ation we saw ."
"You comp@@ are ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extre@@ me@@ ly good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are v@@ ast@@ ly much wor@@ se ."
The differ@@ ences were dra@@ m@@ atic .
"E@@ ri@@ k , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w , he su@@ f@@ f@@ ers from prost@@ ate can@@ cer , and he probably needs sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"Now living in Europ@@ e , he can cho@@ ose to go to G@@ er@@ many that has a wel@@ l-@@ re@@ pu@@ ted health@@ care system ."
"If he goes there and goes to the a@@ ver@@ age ho@@ spit@@ al , he will have the ri@@ sk of be@@ coming in@@ contin@@ ent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start we@@ aring di@@ a@@ per@@ s again ."
You fli@@ p a co@@ in . F@@ i@@ f@@ ty percent ri@@ sk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
"If he instead would go to H@@ am@@ bur@@ g , and to a c@@ lin@@ ic called the Mar@@ t@@ ini@@ -@@ K@@ lini@@ k , the ri@@ sk would be only one in 20 ."
"E@@ i@@ ther you a fli@@ p a co@@ in , or you have a one in 20 ri@@ sk ."
"That &apos;s a huge difference , a se@@ ven@@ -@@ f@@ old difference ."
"When we look at many ho@@ spi@@ tal@@ s for many different dise@@ ases , we see these huge differ@@ ences ."
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
"And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exi@@ st ."
So going the ho@@ spit@@ al is a lot@@ tery .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope ."
"In the l@@ ate &apos; 7@@ 0s , there were a group of S@@ we@@ di@@ sh or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons who met at their an@@ nu@@ al me@@ e@@ ting , and they were di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing the different pro@@ ce@@ du@@ res they used to oper@@ ate hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"To the left of this sli@@ de , you see a v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of me@@ tal pie@@ ces , arti@@ fi@@ cial hi@@ ps that you would use for somebody who needs a new hi@@ p ."
They all realized they had their individu@@ al way of oper@@ ating .
"They all ar@@ gu@@ ed that , &quot; &quot; My techni@@ qu@@ e is the best , &quot; &quot; but n@@ one of them actually knew , and they ad@@ mi@@ t@@ ted that ."
"So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to meas@@ ure qu@@ ality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years de@@ b@@ ating , &quot; So what is qu@@ ality in hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery ? &quot;"
"&quot; Oh , we should meas@@ ure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should meas@@ ure that . &quot;"
And they finally ag@@ re@@ ed .
"And once they had ag@@ re@@ ed , they started meas@@ ur@@ ing , and started sh@@ aring the data ."
"@@ V@@ ery quickly , they found that if you put c@@ ement in the b@@ one of the patien@@ t before you put the me@@ tal sha@@ ft in , it actually la@@ st@@ ed a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on in their li@@ fe@@ time ."
"They publi@@ shed the data , and it actually trans@@ form@@ ed c@@ lini@@ cal prac@@ ti@@ ce in the country ."
E@@ very@@ body saw this makes a lot of sense .
"S@@ in@@ ce then , they publi@@ sh every year ."
"O@@ n@@ ce a year , they publi@@ sh the le@@ ag@@ ue table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bot@@ tom ?"
"And they visi@@ t each other to try to learn , so a contin@@ u@@ ous cy@@ cle of impro@@ v@@ ement ."
Now I found this prin@@ ci@@ ple really exci@@ ting .
"So the physi@@ ci@@ ans get together , they ag@@ ree on what qu@@ ality is , they start meas@@ ur@@ ing , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it ."
Con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ous impro@@ v@@ ement .
"Now , that &apos;s not the only exci@@ ting part ."
That &apos;s exci@@ ting in itself .
"But if you bring back the cost side of the equ@@ ation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have fo@@ c@@ used on qu@@ ality , they actually also have the low@@ est co@@ sts , al@@ though that &apos;s not been the pur@@ pos@@ e in the first place ."
"So if you look at the hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they com@@ par@@ ed the U.@@ S. and S@@ we@@ den ."
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on seven years after the first sur@@ g@@ ery .
"In the United States , the number was three times high@@ er than in S@@ we@@ den ."
We did a study where we looked at O@@ E@@ C@@ D data .
"O@@ E@@ C@@ D does , every so often , look at qu@@ ality of care where they can find the data across the member countries ."
"The United States has , for many dise@@ ases , actually a qu@@ ality which is be@@ low the a@@ ver@@ age in O@@ E@@ C@@ D ."
"Now , if the American health@@ care system would fo@@ cus a lot more on meas@@ ur@@ ing qu@@ ality , and ra@@ ise qu@@ ality just to the level of a@@ ver@@ age O@@ E@@ C@@ D , it would sa@@ ve the American people 500 billion U.@@ S. dollars a year ."
"That &apos;s 20 percent of the bud@@ get , of the health@@ care bud@@ get of the country ."
"This would be a par@@ ad@@ ig@@ m shi@@ ft in health@@ care , and I would ar@@ gu@@ e that not only can it be done , but it has to be done ."
"In my prac@@ ti@@ ce as a con@@ sul@@ t@@ ant , I me@@ et probably a hundre@@ d or more than a hundre@@ d do@@ ct@@ ors and n@@ ur@@ ses and other ho@@ spit@@ al or health@@ care st@@ af@@ f every year ."
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they ach@@ ie@@ ve in terms of qu@@ ality for their patients .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans are , like most of you in the audience , very compe@@ ti@@ tive ."
They were always best in clas@@ s .
We were always best in clas@@ s .
"And if somebody can show them that the resul@@ t they per@@ form for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to impro@@ ve ."
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physi@@ ci@@ ans have another char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ stic .
They actually th@@ ri@@ ve from pe@@ er re@@ cogni@@ tion .
"So it is , by meas@@ ur@@ ing and cre@@ ating tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy , you get a cy@@ cle of contin@@ u@@ ous impro@@ v@@ ement , which is what this sli@@ de shows ."
This is happening in re@@ ality .
"T@@ og@@ e@@ ther with two ac@@ a@@ demi@@ c institu@@ tions , Mi@@ cha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ iness S@@ cho@@ ol , and the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ sk@@ a In@@ stitu@@ te in S@@ we@@ den , B@@ C@@ G has form@@ ed something we call I@@ C@@ H@@ O@@ M ."
"You may think that &apos;s a s@@ ne@@ e@@ ze , but it &apos;s not a s@@ ne@@ e@@ ze , it &apos;s an ac@@ ro@@ n@@ ym ."
It stan@@ ds for the Inter@@ national Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um for H@@ e@@ alth O@@ ut@@ come Me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ ment .
"We &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing together le@@ ading physi@@ ci@@ ans and patients to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s , dise@@ ase by dise@@ ase , what is really qu@@ ality , what should we meas@@ ure , and to make those stan@@ dar@@ ds global ."
"They &apos;ve worked — four working grou@@ ps have worked during the past year : cat@@ ar@@ ac@@ ts , back pa@@ in , co@@ ron@@ ary ar@@ tery dise@@ ase , which is , for in@@ stance , heart att@@ ack , and prost@@ ate can@@ cer ."
The four grou@@ ps will publi@@ sh their data in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber of this year .
"That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be com@@ par@@ ing app@@ les to app@@ les , not only within a country , but between countries ."
"N@@ ex@@ t year , we &apos;re plan@@ ning to do eight dise@@ ases , the year after , 16 ."
"In three years &apos; time , we pl@@ an to have co@@ vered 40 percent of the dise@@ ase bur@@ den ."
C@@ om@@ p@@ are app@@ les to app@@ les . Wh@@ o &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
"F@@ i@@ ve months ago , I led a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p at the largest uni@@ versity ho@@ spit@@ al in Nor@@ ther@@ n Europ@@ e ."
"They have a new C@@ E@@ O , and she has a vision : I want to man@@ age my big institu@@ tion much more on qu@@ ality , out@@ comes that matter to patients ."
"This particular day , we s@@ at in a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p together with physi@@ ci@@ ans , n@@ ur@@ ses and other st@@ af@@ f , di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing le@@ u@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children ."
"The group di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed , how do we meas@@ ure qu@@ ality today ?"
C@@ an we meas@@ ure it better than we do ?
"We di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed , how do we tre@@ at these kids , what are important impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents ?"
"And we di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed what are the co@@ sts for these patients , can we do tre@@ at@@ ment more ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ tly ?"
There was an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous energy in the room .
"A@@ t the end of the me@@ e@@ ting , the cha@@ ir@@ man of the de@@ part@@ ment , he sto@@ od up ."
"He looked over the group and he said — first he ra@@ is@@ ed his hand , I for@@ got that — he ra@@ is@@ ed his hand , c@@ len@@ ched his fi@@ st , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
"Th@@ ank you .

Thank you .

I believe that the star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation is one of the gre@@ at@@ est form@@ s to make the world a better place .
"But if the star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation is so great , why do so many fa@@ il ?"
That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
"I &apos;d done well at school . E@@ x@@ pe@@ ct@@ ations for me were high , and I g@@ le@@ e@@ fully en@@ ter@@ ed the stud@@ ent life of le@@ ctures , par@@ ties and traf@@ fic c@@ one the@@ ft ."
"U@@ n@@ der@@ ne@@ ath , I was actually de@@ e@@ ply un@@ happy , in@@ secu@@ re and fundam@@ ent@@ ally f@@ ri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — f@@ ri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of other people , of the future , of fai@@ lu@@ re and of the em@@ p@@ t@@ iness that I felt was within me ."
"I was lea@@ ving a se@@ min@@ ar when it started , hum@@ ming to myself , f@@ um@@ b@@ ling with my ba@@ g just as I &apos;d done a hundre@@ d times before , when sud@@ den@@ ly I heard a vo@@ ice cal@@ m@@ ly obser@@ ve , &quot; She is lea@@ ving the room . &quot;"
"I looked around , and there was no one there , but the c@@ lar@@ ity and deci@@ si@@ ven@@ ess of the com@@ ment was un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able ."
&quot; She is open@@ ing the door . &quot;
This was the beginning . The vo@@ ice had ar@@ ri@@ ved .
"And the vo@@ ice per@@ si@@ st@@ ed , days and then weeks of it , on and on , nar@@ r@@ ating everything I did in the third person ."
&quot; She is going to a le@@ cture . &quot;
"It was neu@@ tra@@ l , im@@ pas@@ sive and even , after a while , str@@ ang@@ ely comp@@ ani@@ on@@ ate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , al@@ though I did noti@@ ce that its cal@@ m ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or sometimes sli@@ pped and that it oc@@ ca@@ si@@ on@@ ally mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red my own u@@ ne@@ x@@ pres@@ sed emoti@@ on ."
"So , for example , if I was ang@@ ry and had to hi@@ de it , which I often did , being very a@@ de@@ pt at con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing how I really felt , then the vo@@ ice would sound f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated ."
"A sub@@ tle con@@ di@@ tion@@ ing process had be@@ gu@@ n , the im@@ p@@ lic@@ ation that nor@@ mal people don &apos;t hear vo@@ i@@ ces and the fact that I did me@@ ant that something was very seri@@ ously wrong ."
I spent some time tel@@ ling the colle@@ ge G@@ .@@ P@@ .
"And to be fa@@ ir , I was des@@ per@@ ate for inter@@ est and help , and I began to tell him about my str@@ ange com@@ ment@@ ator ."
"For example , I was part of a stud@@ ent T@@ V st@@ ation that bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast news bu@@ l@@ let@@ ins around the cam@@ pu@@ s , and during an ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment which was ru@@ n@@ ning very l@@ ate , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , do@@ ctor , I &apos;ve got to go ."
It was at this point that ev@@ ents began to ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly over@@ take me .
"A ho@@ spit@@ al ad@@ mis@@ sion fol@@ low@@ ed , the first of many , a di@@ ag@@ no@@ sis of s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ enia came next , and then , wor@@ st of all , a to@@ x@@ ic , tor@@ ment@@ ing sense of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , hu@@ mili@@ ation and des@@ pa@@ ir about myself and my pro@@ spe@@ cts ."
"But having been en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to see the vo@@ ice not as an experience but as a sym@@ p@@ tom , my fe@@ ar and resi@@ stance towar@@ ds it inten@@ si@@ f@@ ied ."
"Now essen@@ ti@@ ally , this re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted taking an ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sive stance towar@@ ds my own mind , a kind of psy@@ chi@@ c ci@@ vi@@ l war , and in turn this ca@@ used the number of vo@@ i@@ ces to incre@@ ase and gro@@ w pro@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vely h@@ ost@@ ile and men@@ ac@@ ing ."
You see that gl@@ as@@ s of water ?
"In effe@@ ct , a vi@@ ci@@ ous cy@@ cle of fe@@ ar , av@@ o@@ i@@ dance , mi@@ str@@ ust and mi@@ su@@ n@@ der@@ standing had been est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed , and this was a bat@@ tle in which I felt power@@ less and in@@ cap@@ able of est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing any kind of pe@@ ace or re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ."
"T@@ wo years later , and the de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ation was dra@@ m@@ atic ."
"B@@ y now , I had the whole fr@@ en@@ z@@ ie@@ d re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re : terri@@ f@@ ying vo@@ i@@ ces , gro@@ te@@ squ@@ e vi@@ sions , bi@@ zar@@ re , in@@ trac@@ table de@@ lu@@ sions ."
"Now looking back on the w@@ re@@ ck@@ age and des@@ pa@@ ir of those years , it seem@@ s to me now as if someone d@@ ied in that place , and yet , someone else was sa@@ ved ."
"A bro@@ k@@ en and ha@@ un@@ ted person began that jour@@ ney , but the person who em@@ er@@ g@@ ed was a survi@@ v@@ or and would ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely gro@@ w into the person I was de@@ st@@ ined to be ."
"M@@ any people have har@@ med me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memor@@ ies gro@@ w p@@ ale and fa@@ int in com@@ par@@ is@@ on with the people who &apos;ve hel@@ ped me ."
I believe that E@@ le@@ an@@ or can get through this .
"S@@ ome@@ times , you know , it s@@ now@@ s as l@@ ate as M@@ ay , but sum@@ m@@ er always comes ev@@ en@@ tually . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ te@@ en minutes is not enough time to fully cre@@ d@@ it those good and gener@@ ous people who f@@ ou@@ ght with me and for me and who wai@@ ted to wel@@ come me back from that ag@@ oni@@ zed , lon@@ ely place ."
"Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the vo@@ i@@ ces ap@@ pe@@ ared so h@@ ost@@ ile and men@@ ac@@ ing , so in this re@@ spe@@ ct , a vi@@ tal first ste@@ p was lear@@ ning to se@@ par@@ ate out a me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ori@@ cal me@@ an@@ ing from what I &apos;d pre@@ vi@@ ously inter@@ pre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al tru@@ th ."
"So for example , vo@@ i@@ ces which thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to att@@ ack my home I learned to inter@@ pre@@ t as my own sense of fe@@ ar and in@@ secu@@ ri@@ ty in the world , rather than an ac@@ tu@@ al , obje@@ ctive d@@ ang@@ er ."
"Now at first , I would have belie@@ ved them ."
"I remember , for example , sitting up one night on gu@@ ard outside my parents &apos; room to prote@@ ct them from what I thought was a gen@@ u@@ ine thre@@ at from the vo@@ i@@ ces ."
"It was like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t m@@ ess with me ."
"I &apos;ve got a pla@@ stic for@@ k , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ate@@ gi@@ c ."
"It was ar@@ med with this know@@ le@@ dge that ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely I would ga@@ ther together my sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed self , each fra@@ g@@ ment re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted by a different vo@@ ice , gra@@ du@@ ally with@@ dra@@ w from all my medi@@ cation , and re@@ turn to psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry , only this time from the other side ."

I &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y .
O@@ r is it photograph@@ y ?
"Because , of course , this is a photogra@@ ph that you can &apos;t take with your cam@@ era ."
"@@ Y@@ et , my inter@@ est in photograph@@ y started as I got my first di@@ gi@@ tal cam@@ era at the age of 15 ."
"It mi@@ x@@ ed with my ear@@ lie@@ r pas@@ sion for d@@ raw@@ ing , but it was a bit different , because using the cam@@ era , the process was in the plan@@ ning instead ."
"And when you take a photogra@@ ph with a cam@@ era , the process en@@ ds when you pre@@ ss the tri@@ g@@ ger ."
So to me it felt like photograph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like any@@ one could do that .
"So I wanted to create something different , something where the process star@@ ts when you pre@@ ss the tri@@ g@@ ger ."
P@@ hot@@ os like this : con@@ stru@@ ction going on along a bus@@ y ro@@ ad .
But it has an u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted t@@ wi@@ st .
"And des@@ pi@@ te that , it re@@ ta@@ ins a level of reali@@ sm ."
"O@@ r ph@@ ot@@ os like these — both dar@@ k and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common go@@ al of re@@ ta@@ ining the level of reali@@ sm ."
"When I say reali@@ sm , I mean ph@@ ot@@ o@@ -@@ reali@@ sm ."
"Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tu@@ red some@@ how as a photogra@@ ph ."
P@@ hot@@ os where you will need a br@@ ie@@ f moment to think to figure out the tri@@ ck .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea than about cap@@ tur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the tri@@ ck that makes it look reali@@ stic ?
Is it something about the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s or the col@@ ors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What cre@@ ates the il@@ lu@@ sion ?
S@@ ome@@ times the perspe@@ ctive is the il@@ lu@@ sion .
"But in the end , it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a two@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal surface ."
"It &apos;s not really what is reali@@ stic , it &apos;s what we think looks reali@@ stic really ."
So I think the basi@@ cs are quite simple .
I just see it as a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of re@@ ality where you can take different pie@@ ces of re@@ ality and put it together to create alter@@ n@@ ate re@@ ality .
And let me show you a simple example .
"H@@ ere we have three perfe@@ ct@@ ly imag@@ in@@ able physi@@ cal obje@@ cts , something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal world ."
"But com@@ b@@ ined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal , like it could exi@@ st ."
"But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t ."
"So we tri@@ ck our bra@@ ins , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t ac@@ cept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense ."
And I see the same process with com@@ b@@ ining photograph@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about com@@ b@@ ining different reali@@ ties .
"So the things that make a photogra@@ ph look reali@@ stic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our da@@ i@@ ly lives ."
"But when com@@ b@@ ining photograph@@ s , this is really important to consi@@ der , because o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se it just looks wrong some@@ how ."
So I would like to say that there are three simple ru@@ les to fol@@ low to ach@@ ie@@ ve a reali@@ stic resul@@ t .
"As you can see , these images ar@@ en &apos;t really spe@@ cial ."
"But com@@ b@@ ined , they can create something like this ."
So the first ru@@ le is that ph@@ ot@@ os com@@ b@@ ined should have the same perspe@@ ctive .
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , ph@@ ot@@ os com@@ b@@ ined should have the same ty@@ pe of light ."
And these two images both fu@@ l@@ fi@@ ll these two requi@@ re@@ ments — sh@@ ot at the same he@@ ight and in the same ty@@ pe of light .
The third one is about making it im@@ possible to di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ h where the different images beg@@ in and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
M@@ ake it im@@ possible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed .
"So by mat@@ ching color , con@@ tra@@ st and bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photogra@@ phi@@ c de@@ fe@@ cts like de@@ p@@ th of fie@@ ld , des@@ atur@@ ated col@@ ors and no@@ ise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , des@@ pi@@ te the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundre@@ ds of la@@ y@@ ers basically ."
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a land@@ s@@ cape and the low@@ er part is what &apos;s m@@ ani@@ pu@@ lated .
But this image is actually enti@@ re@@ ly com@@ posed of photograph@@ s from different lo@@ c@@ ations .
"I per@@ son@@ ally think that it &apos;s e@@ as@@ ier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se with the ideas in your head ."
But it does requi@@ re a lot of plan@@ ning .
"And getting this idea during win@@ ter , I knew that I had se@@ ver@@ al months to pl@@ an it , to find the different lo@@ c@@ ations for the pie@@ ces of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le basically ."
"So for example , the fish was cap@@ tu@@ red on a fi@@ sh@@ ing tri@@ p ."
The sho@@ res are from a different lo@@ cation .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tu@@ red in a st@@ one p@@ it .
"And ye@@ ah , I even turned the house on top of the is@@ land red to make it look more S@@ we@@ di@@ sh ."
"So to ach@@ ie@@ ve a reali@@ stic resul@@ t , I think it comes down to plan@@ ning ."
"It always star@@ ts with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea ."
Th@@ en it &apos;s about com@@ b@@ ining the different photograph@@ s .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
"And if you do a good job cap@@ tur@@ ing the ph@@ ot@@ os , the resul@@ t can be quite beautiful and also quite reali@@ stic ."
"So all the to@@ ols are out there , and the only thing that li@@ mi@@ ts us is our imag@@ in@@ ation ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
The rele@@ ase of these pa@@ per@@ s from P@@ an@@ ama li@@ f@@ ts the ve@@ il on a t@@ iny piece of the se@@ cre@@ tive of@@ f@@ sh@@ ore world .
"Now , this has already started to have pretty im@@ medi@@ ate re@@ per@@ c@@ us@@ sions ."
The P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er of I@@ cel@@ and has re@@ sig@@ ned .
We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the bru@@ tal Sy@@ ri@@ an di@@ ct@@ ator B@@ as@@ ha@@ r Al@@ -@@ A@@ s@@ sa@@ d has also got of@@ f@@ sh@@ ore comp@@ an@@ ies .
"There &apos;s been al@@ leg@@ ations of a $ 2 billion money tra@@ il that le@@ ads back to P@@ resi@@ dent V@@ l@@ ad@@ imi@@ r P@@ ut@@ in of R@@ us@@ si@@ a vi@@ a his close chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od friend , who happens to be a top cel@@ li@@ st ."
And there will be a lot of ri@@ ch individu@@ als out there and others who will be ner@@ v@@ ous about the next set of stories and the next set of le@@ ak@@ ed do@@ cu@@ ments .
"Now , this sounds like the p@@ lot of a sp@@ y th@@ ri@@ l@@ ler or a Joh@@ n G@@ ri@@ sha@@ m no@@ vel ."
Why should we care about this ?
"But the tru@@ th is that if ri@@ ch and powerful individu@@ als are able to keep their money of@@ f@@ sh@@ ore and not pay the ta@@ x@@ es that they should , it means that there is less money for vi@@ tal public ser@@ vi@@ ces like health@@ care , education , ro@@ ads ."
And that af@@ fe@@ cts all of us .
"Now , for my organiz@@ ation G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this ex@@ pos@@ é has been ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al ."
We have the world &apos;s media and poli@@ tical le@@ ad@@ ers talking about how individu@@ als can use of@@ f@@ sh@@ ore se@@ cre@@ cy to hi@@ de and dis@@ gu@@ ise their as@@ se@@ ts — something we have been talking about and ex@@ pos@@ ing for a dec@@ ade .
"Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world b@@ af@@ f@@ ling and con@@ f@@ using , and hard to understand how this sort of of@@ f@@ sh@@ ore world works ."
"So you can have one company st@@ ac@@ ked inside another company , st@@ ac@@ ked inside another company , making it almost im@@ possible to really understand who is behind these stru@@ ctures ."
"It can be very difficult for la@@ w en@@ for@@ c@@ ement or ta@@ x au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ies , jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sts , ci@@ vi@@ l society to really understand what &apos;s going on ."
I also think it &apos;s interesting that there &apos;s been less co@@ ver@@ age of this issue in the United States .
"And that &apos;s per@@ haps because some pro@@ min@@ ent U@@ S people just ha@@ ven &apos;t figu@@ red in this ex@@ pos@@ é , in this sc@@ and@@ al ."
"Now , that &apos;s not because there are no ri@@ ch Ameri@@ cans who are st@@ ash@@ ing their as@@ se@@ ts of@@ f@@ sh@@ ore ."
"It &apos;s just because of the way in which of@@ f@@ sh@@ ore works , M@@ os@@ s@@ ack F@@ on@@ se@@ ca has fe@@ wer American cl@@ ien@@ ts ."
"I think if we saw le@@ ak@@ s from the C@@ a@@ y@@ man Is@@ l@@ ands or even from D@@ el@@ aw@@ are or Wy@@ om@@ ing or N@@ ev@@ ada , you would see many more c@@ ases and exam@@ ples lin@@ king back to Ameri@@ cans ."
"In fact , in a number of U@@ S st@@ ates you need less information , you need to provi@@ de less information to get a company than you do to get a li@@ br@@ ary car@@ d ."
That sort of se@@ cre@@ cy in America has allow@@ ed em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es of school di@@ stri@@ cts to ri@@ p off scho@@ ol@@ children .
It has allow@@ ed sc@@ am@@ m@@ ers to ri@@ p off v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able inv@@ est@@ ors .
This is the sort of behavi@@ or that af@@ fe@@ cts all of us .
"Now , at G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in prac@@ ti@@ ce ."
How does this actually work ?
So what we did is we s@@ ent in an under@@ co@@ ver inv@@ esti@@ gat@@ or to 1@@ 3 M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an la@@ w fir@@ ms .
"O@@ ur inv@@ esti@@ gat@@ or posed as an Afri@@ can min@@ ist@@ er who wanted to move s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct fun@@ ds into the United States to bu@@ y a house , a y@@ ach@@ t , a je@@ t ."
"Now , what was tru@@ ly sh@@ oc@@ king was that all but one of those la@@ wy@@ ers provi@@ ded our inv@@ esti@@ gat@@ or with su@@ gg@@ esti@@ ons on how to move those s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct fun@@ ds ."
"These were all pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary me@@ et@@ ings , and n@@ one of the la@@ wy@@ ers took us on as a cl@@ ien@@ t and of course no money mo@@ ved h@@ ands , but it really shows the problem with the system ."
It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individu@@ al c@@ ases .
This is not just about an individu@@ al la@@ wy@@ er who &apos;s spo@@ k@@ en to our under@@ co@@ ver inv@@ esti@@ gat@@ or and provi@@ ded su@@ gg@@ esti@@ ons .
It &apos;s not just about a particular s@@ eni@@ or poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an who &apos;s been ca@@ u@@ ght up in a sc@@ and@@ al .
"This is about how a system works , that en@@ tr@@ en@@ ch@@ es cor@@ ru@@ ption , ta@@ x ev@@ a@@ sion , po@@ ver@@ ty and in@@ st@@ ability ."
"And in order to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le this , we need to change the g@@ ame ."
We need to change the ru@@ les of the g@@ ame to make this sort of behavi@@ or har@@ der .
"This may se@@ em like do@@ om and g@@ lo@@ om , like there &apos;s nothing we can do about it , like nothing has ever changed , like there will always be ri@@ ch and powerful individu@@ als ."
"But as a natural op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st , I do see that we are star@@ ting to get some change ."
"O@@ ver the last couple of years , we &apos;ve seen a real p@@ us@@ h towar@@ ds gre@@ ater tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy when it comes to company ow@@ ner@@ ship ."
This issue was put on the poli@@ tical ag@@ en@@ da by the U@@ K P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er Davi@@ d C@@ am@@ er@@ on at a big G@@ 8 S@@ um@@ m@@ it that was he@@ ld in Nor@@ ther@@ n I@@ rel@@ and in 20@@ 1@@ 3 .
"And since then , the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on is going to be cre@@ ating cent@@ ral regi@@ st@@ ers at a national level of who really ow@@ ns and contro@@ ls comp@@ an@@ ies across Europ@@ e ."
"One of the things that is sa@@ d is that , actually , the U@@ S is l@@ ag@@ g@@ ing behind ."
"There &apos;s bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an le@@ gi@@ sl@@ ation that had been in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced in the H@@ ou@@ se and the S@@ en@@ ate , but it isn &apos;t making as much pro@@ gre@@ ss as we &apos;d like to see ."
"So we &apos;d really want to see the P@@ an@@ ama le@@ ak@@ s , this huge pe@@ ek into the of@@ f@@ sh@@ ore world , be used as a way of open@@ ing up in the U@@ S and around the world ."
"For us at G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this is a moment for change ."
We need ordin@@ ary people to get ang@@ ry at the way in which people can hi@@ de their iden@@ ti@@ ty behind se@@ cre@@ t comp@@ an@@ ies .
"We need business le@@ ad@@ ers to stand up and say , &quot; Se@@ cre@@ cy like this is not good for business . &quot;"
"We need poli@@ tical le@@ ad@@ ers to re@@ cogni@@ ze the problem , and to comm@@ it to chang@@ ing the la@@ w to open up this sort of se@@ cre@@ cy ."
"T@@ og@@ e@@ ther , we can end the se@@ cre@@ cy that is cur@@ r@@ ently allow@@ ing ta@@ x ev@@ a@@ sion , cor@@ ru@@ ption , money la@@ under@@ ing to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh ."
"Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Ju@@ li@@ an , wel@@ come ."
"It &apos;s been re@@ por@@ ted that Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s , your b@@ aby , has , in the last few years has rele@@ as@@ ed more clas@@ si@@ f@@ ied do@@ cu@@ ments than the rest of the world &apos;s media com@@ b@@ ined ."
C@@ an that possi@@ bly be true ?
"J@@ uli@@ an A@@ s@@ s@@ ange : Yeah , can it possi@@ bly be true ?"
It &apos;s a wor@@ ry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of acti@@ vi@@ sts is able to rele@@ ase more of that ty@@ pe of information than the rest of the world pre@@ ss com@@ b@@ ined .
CA : How does it work ?
How do people rele@@ ase the do@@ cu@@ ments ?
And how do you secu@@ re their pri@@ vac@@ y ?
"J@@ A : So these are — as far as we can tell — clas@@ si@@ cal wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us ."
"So we use this st@@ ate@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art en@@ c@@ ry@@ ption to b@@ oun@@ ce stuff around the Inter@@ net , to hi@@ de tra@@ il@@ s , pas@@ s it through leg@@ al ju@@ ri@@ s@@ di@@ ctions like S@@ we@@ den and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those leg@@ al prote@@ ctions ."
"We get information in the ma@@ il , the regu@@ lar post@@ al ma@@ il , en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted or not , v@@ et it like a regu@@ lar news organiz@@ ation , form@@ at it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about gi@@ ant d@@ at@@ ab@@ ases of information — rele@@ ase it to the public and then def@@ end ourselves against the in@@ evi@@ table leg@@ al and poli@@ tical att@@ ac@@ ks ."
"CA : So you make an ef@@ for@@ t to en@@ sure the do@@ cu@@ ments are le@@ gi@@ ti@@ m@@ ate , but you actually almost never know who the iden@@ ti@@ ty of the source is ?"
"J@@ A : That &apos;s right , ye@@ ah . V@@ ery r@@ are@@ ly do we ever know , and if we find out at some st@@ age then we de@@ stro@@ y that information as so@@ on as possible ."
( P@@ h@@ one ring ) God dam@@ n it .
( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the C@@ I@@ A as@@ king what the c@@ od@@ e is for a TED mem@@ ber@@ ship . ( Laughter )
"So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually ."
This is something you le@@ ak@@ ed a few years ago .
If we can have this do@@ cu@@ ment up ...
So this was a story in Ken@@ ya a few years ago .
C@@ an you tell us what you le@@ ak@@ ed and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ ro@@ ll Re@@ port .
This was a se@@ cre@@ t inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence re@@ port com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed by the Ken@@ y@@ an government after its ele@@ ction in 200@@ 4 .
"P@@ ri@@ or to 200@@ 4 , Ken@@ ya was ru@@ led by D@@ anie@@ l ar@@ a@@ p Mo@@ i for about 18 years ."
He was a so@@ ft di@@ ct@@ ator of Ken@@ ya .
"And when K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i got into power — through a co@@ ali@@ tion of for@@ ces that were trying to cle@@ an up cor@@ ru@@ ption in Ken@@ ya — they com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed this re@@ port , spent about two million po@@ un@@ ds on this and an as@@ so@@ ci@@ ated re@@ port ."
"And then the government s@@ at on it and used it for poli@@ tical le@@ ver@@ age on Mo@@ i , who was the ri@@ ch@@ est man — still is the ri@@ ch@@ est man — in Ken@@ ya ."
It &apos;s the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il of Ken@@ y@@ an jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sm .
"So I went there in 200@@ 7 , and we man@@ aged to get h@@ old of this just pri@@ or to the ele@@ ction — the national ele@@ ction , De@@ c@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 8 ."
"When we rele@@ as@@ ed that re@@ port , we did so three days after the new pre@@ si@@ dent , K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i , had decided to p@@ al up with the man that he was going to cle@@ an out , D@@ anie@@ l ar@@ a@@ p Mo@@ i , so this re@@ port then became a de@@ ad al@@ bat@@ ross around P@@ resi@@ dent K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i &apos;s ne@@ ck ."
"CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story shor@@ t — word of the re@@ port le@@ ak@@ ed into Ken@@ ya , not from the offi@@ cial media , but indi@@ re@@ ct@@ ly , and in your op@@ ini@@ on , it actually shi@@ f@@ ted the ele@@ ction ."
"J@@ A : Yeah . So this became front p@@ age of the G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an and was then prin@@ ted in all the sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding countries of Ken@@ ya , in T@@ an@@ z@@ ani@@ an and S@@ outh Afri@@ can pre@@ ss ."
And so it came in from the outside .
"And that , after a couple of days , made the Ken@@ y@@ an pre@@ ss feel sa@@ fe to talk about it ."
"And it ran for 20 ni@@ ghts stra@@ ight on Ken@@ y@@ an T@@ V , shi@@ f@@ ted the v@@ ot@@ e by 10 percent , ac@@ cor@@ ding to a Ken@@ y@@ an inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence re@@ port , which changed the resul@@ t of the ele@@ ction ."
"CA : W@@ ow , so your le@@ ak really sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally changed the world ?"
J@@ A : Y@@ ep .
( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a shor@@ t cli@@ p from this B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad air@@ stri@@ ke video .
"The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a shor@@ t cli@@ p ."
"This is — this is inten@@ se materi@@ al , I should war@@ n you ."
"R@@ ad@@ i@@ o : ... just fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up ."
"I see your ele@@ ment , u@@ h , got about four H@@ um@@ ve@@ es , u@@ h , out along ..."
You &apos;re clear . All right . F@@ ir@@ ing .
Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s sho@@ ot .

"@@ we need to move , time now !"
"A@@ ll right , we just eng@@ aged all eight individu@@ als ."
"@@ Yeah , we see two bir@@ ds &#91; he@@ lic@@ op@@ ters &#93; , and we &apos;re still fir@@ ing ."
R@@ og@@ er . I got &apos; em .
"T@@ wo@@ -@@ S@@ i@@ x , this is T@@ wo@@ -@@ S@@ i@@ x , we &apos;re mo@@ bi@@ le ."
"O@@ op@@ s , I &apos;m sor@@ ry . What was going on ?"
"G@@ od dam@@ n it , K@@ y@@ le . All right , ha@@ ha@@ h@@ a . I h@@ it &apos; em ."
"CA : So , what was the impac@@ t of that ?"
J@@ A : The impac@@ t on the people who worked on it was se@@ v@@ ere .
We en@@ ded up sen@@ ding two people to B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad to f@@ ur@@ ther research that story .
So this is just the first of three att@@ ac@@ ks that oc@@ cur@@ red in that scen@@ e .
"CA : So , I mean , 11 people d@@ ied in that att@@ ack , right , inclu@@ ding two Re@@ u@@ ters em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es ?"
"J@@ A : Yeah . T@@ wo Re@@ u@@ ters em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es , two young children were w@@ oun@@ ded ."
There were between 18 and 2@@ 6 people kil@@ led all together .
CA : And rele@@ as@@ ing this ca@@ used wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ou@@ tra@@ ge .
"What was the key ele@@ ment of this that actually ca@@ used the ou@@ tra@@ ge , do you think ?"
J@@ A : I don &apos;t know . I gu@@ ess people can see the g@@ ross disp@@ ari@@ ty in force .
"You have guys wal@@ king in a re@@ la@@ x@@ ed way down the stre@@ et , and then an Ap@@ ac@@ he he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter sitting up at one kilome@@ ter fir@@ ing 3@@ 0-@@ mi@@ lli@@ me@@ ter can@@ n@@ on sh@@ el@@ ls on everyone — looking for any ex@@ c@@ use to do so — and kil@@ ling people re@@ s@@ cu@@ ing the w@@ oun@@ ded ."
And there was two jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sts inv@@ olved that c@@ lear@@ ly wer@@ en &apos;t in@@ sur@@ g@@ ents because that &apos;s their fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time job .
"CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.@@ S. inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ence an@@ al@@ y@@ st , Bra@@ d@@ ley M@@ an@@ ning , ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed , and it &apos;s al@@ leg@@ ed that he con@@ f@@ ess@@ ed in a ch@@ at room to have le@@ ak@@ ed this video to you , along with 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 clas@@ si@@ f@@ ied U.@@ S. em@@ bas@@ sy c@@ ab@@ les ."
"I mean , did he ?"
J@@ A : We have den@@ ied re@@ cei@@ ving those c@@ ab@@ les .
"He has been char@@ g@@ ed , about five days ago , with ob@@ ta@@ ining 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 c@@ ab@@ les and rele@@ as@@ ing 50 ."
"Now , we had rele@@ as@@ ed , early in the year , a c@@ able from the R@@ ey@@ k@@ ja@@ vi@@ k U.@@ S. em@@ bas@@ sy , but this is not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly conne@@ cted ."
"I mean , I was a known visi@@ tor of that em@@ bas@@ sy ."
"CA : I mean , if you did re@@ cei@@ ve thousands of U.@@ S. em@@ bas@@ sy di@@ pl@@ om@@ atic c@@ ab@@ les ..."
"J@@ A : We would have rele@@ as@@ ed them . ( CA : You would ? ) J@@ A : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) J@@ A : Well , because these sort of things re@@ ve@@ al what the true state of , say , A@@ ra@@ b govern@@ ments are like , the true hum@@ an@@ -@@ ri@@ ghts ab@@ uses in those govern@@ ments ."
"If you look at de@@ clas@@ si@@ f@@ ied c@@ ab@@ les , that &apos;s the sort of materi@@ al that &apos;s there ."
CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more bro@@ ad@@ ly about this .
"I mean , in gener@@ al , what &apos;s your phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y ?"
Why is it right to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge le@@ aking of se@@ cre@@ t information ?
"J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can ach@@ ie@@ ve re@@ form ."
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
"So information that organiz@@ ations are sp@@ ending economic ef@@ for@@ t into con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing , that &apos;s a really good sig@@ na@@ l that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organiz@@ ations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are sp@@ ending work to con@@ ce@@ al it ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in prac@@ ti@@ ce , and that &apos;s what the history of jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sm is ."
"CA : But are there ri@@ sk@@ s with that , either to the individu@@ als con@@ cer@@ ned or in@@ de@@ ed to society at large , where le@@ aking can actually have an un@@ inten@@ ded con@@ sequ@@ ence ?"
J@@ A : N@@ ot that we have seen with anything we have rele@@ as@@ ed .
"I mean , we have a har@@ m im@@ muni@@ z@@ ation poli@@ cy ."
We have a way of de@@ al@@ ing with information that has sort of per@@ s@@ onal — per@@ son@@ ally iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ying information in it .
"But there are le@@ gi@@ ti@@ m@@ ate se@@ cre@@ ts — you know , your recor@@ ds with your do@@ ctor ; that &apos;s a le@@ gi@@ ti@@ m@@ ate se@@ cre@@ t — but we deal with wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers that are coming forward that are really sort of wel@@ l-@@ moti@@ v@@ ated ."
CA : So they are wel@@ l-@@ moti@@ v@@ ated .
"And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the par@@ ent of someone wh@@ ose son is out ser@@ ving the U.@@ S. mi@@ lit@@ ary , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an in@@ cen@@ tive to put out ."
It shows a U.@@ S. sol@@ d@@ ier l@@ augh@@ ing at people dy@@ ing .
"That gi@@ ves the im@@ pres@@ sion , has given the im@@ pres@@ sion , to mi@@ llions of people around the world that U.@@ S. sol@@ d@@ ier@@ s are in@@ human people ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How d@@ are you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?"
"J@@ A : Yeah , we do get a lot of that ."
"But remember , the people in B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad , the people in I@@ ra@@ q , the people in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day ."
So it &apos;s not going to change their op@@ ini@@ on . It &apos;s not going to change their per@@ cep@@ tion .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
"It will change the per@@ cep@@ tion and op@@ ini@@ on of the people who are pa@@ ying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope ."
CA : So you found a way to sh@@ ine light into what you see as these sort of dar@@ k se@@ cre@@ ts in comp@@ an@@ ies and in government .
L@@ ight is good .
"But do you see any i@@ ro@@ ny in the fact that , in order for you to sh@@ ine that light , you have to , yourself , create se@@ cre@@ cy around your sources ?"
"J@@ A : N@@ ot really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents yet ."
We don &apos;t have sources who are dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents on other sources .
"S@@ h@@ ould they come forward , that would be a tri@@ ck@@ y situ@@ ation for us , but we &apos;re pre@@ sum@@ ably ac@@ ting in such a way that people feel mor@@ ally compe@@ l@@ led to contin@@ ue our mis@@ sion , not to scre@@ w it up ."
"CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous as to the op@@ ini@@ on in the TED audience ."
"You know , there might be a couple of vie@@ ws of Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s and of Ju@@ li@@ an ."
"You know , her@@ o — people &apos;s her@@ o — br@@ ing@@ ing this important light ."
D@@ ang@@ er@@ ous t@@ rou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er .
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the her@@ o view ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous t@@ rou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er view ?
"J@@ A : Oh , come on . There must be some ."
"CA : It &apos;s a so@@ ft c@@ row@@ d , Ju@@ li@@ an , a so@@ ft c@@ row@@ d ."
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
"Now here &apos;s something that you ha@@ ven &apos;t yet le@@ ak@@ ed , but I think for TED you are ."
"I mean it &apos;s an in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?"
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a sam@@ ple of what we do sort of every day .
"So l@@ ate last year — in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber last year — there was a ser@@ ies of well b@@ low@@ ou@@ ts in Al@@ b@@ ania , like the well b@@ low@@ out in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ exi@@ co , but not quite as big ."
"And we got a re@@ port — a sort of engine@@ ering an@@ al@@ ysi@@ s into what happened — saying that , in fact , secu@@ ri@@ ty gu@@ ar@@ ds from some ri@@ v@@ al , v@@ ari@@ ous compe@@ ting oil fir@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked tru@@ cks there and b@@ low@@ n them up ."
"And part of the Al@@ b@@ ani@@ an government was in this , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
"And the engine@@ ering re@@ port had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extre@@ me@@ ly difficult do@@ cu@@ ment for us ."
We couldn &apos;t ver@@ i@@ fy it because we didn &apos;t know who wro@@ te it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of sk@@ e@@ p@@ tical that maybe it was a compe@@ ting oil fir@@ m just sort of playing the issue up .
"So under that basi@@ s , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , we &apos;re sk@@ e@@ p@@ tical about this thing ."
"We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?"
"The materi@@ al looks good , it feel@@ s right , but we just can &apos;t ver@@ i@@ fy it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a let@@ ter just this week from the company who wro@@ te it , wan@@ ting to tr@@ ack down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , we want to tr@@ ack down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more ."
"What do@@ cu@@ ment is it , pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly , you &apos;re talking about ?"
C@@ an you show that you had leg@@ al au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty over that do@@ cu@@ ment ?
Is it really y@@ ours ? &quot; &quot; So they s@@ ent us this scre@@ en sh@@ ot with the au@@ th@@ or in the Mi@@ cro@@ so@@ ft Wor@@ d I@@ D .
Yeah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
"This is like one of our meth@@ ods of iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ying , of ver@@ i@@ f@@ ying , what a materi@@ al is , is to try and get these guys to write let@@ ters ."
CA : Yeah . Ha@@ ve you had information from inside B@@ P ?
"J@@ A : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are under@@ going a sort of seri@@ ous fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing and engine@@ ering ef@@ for@@ t ."
So our publi@@ cation r@@ ate over the past few months has been sort of min@@ imi@@ zed while we &apos;re re@@ -@@ engine@@ ering our back systems for the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al public inter@@ est that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
"I mean , like any sort of grow@@ ing star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation , we are sort of over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by our grow@@ th , and that means we &apos;re getting en@@ or@@ m@@ ous qu@@ anti@@ ty of wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ er di@@ sc@@ lo@@ su@@ res of a very high c@@ ali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and v@@ et this information ."
"CA : So that &apos;s the key bot@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ ck , basically jour@@ n@@ ali@@ stic vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and / or the fun@@ ding of jour@@ n@@ ali@@ stic s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies ?"
"J@@ A : Y@@ ep . Yeah , and tru@@ st@@ ed people ."
"I mean , we &apos;re an organiz@@ ation that is hard to gro@@ w very quickly because of the sort of materi@@ al we deal with , so we have to re@@ structure in order to have people who will deal with the high@@ est national secu@@ ri@@ ty stuff , and then low@@ er secu@@ ri@@ ty c@@ ases ."
CA : So help us understand a bit about you per@@ son@@ ally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a kid you went to 3@@ 7 different scho@@ ols .
C@@ an that be right ?
"J@@ A : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cul@@ t , so the com@@ bin@@ ation between the two ..."
"( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psycho@@ logi@@ st might say that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ pe for bre@@ e@@ ding par@@ an@@ o@@ ia ."
"J@@ A : What , the movie business ?"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a h@@ ac@@ k@@ er at an early age and ran into the au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ies early on ."
"J@@ A : Well , I was a jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st ."
"You know , I was a very young jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st acti@@ vi@@ st at an early age ."
"I wro@@ te a mag@@ az@@ ine , was pro@@ secu@@ ted for it when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er ."
So you have to be car@@ e@@ ful with h@@ ac@@ k@@ er .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a meth@@ od that can be de@@ plo@@ yed for v@@ ari@@ ous things .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , at the moment , it &apos;s mo@@ st@@ ly de@@ plo@@ yed by the R@@ us@@ si@@ an ma@@ fi@@ a in order to ste@@ al your grand@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts ."
"So this ph@@ ra@@ se is not , not as nice as it used to be ."
"CA : Yeah , well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ al@@ ing any@@ one &apos;s grand@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t , but what about your cor@@ e val@@ u@@ es ?"
C@@ an you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some in@@ ci@@ dent in your life that hel@@ ped de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure about the in@@ ci@@ dent .
"But the cor@@ e val@@ u@@ es : well , cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create vi@@ cti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture vi@@ cti@@ ms ."
"And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men that have been in my life ."
"CA : C@@ ap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create vi@@ cti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture vi@@ cti@@ ms ?"
"J@@ A : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a com@@ b@@ ative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the n@@ ur@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing vi@@ cti@@ ms , which is to poli@@ ce per@@ pe@@ tr@@ at@@ ors of cri@@ me ."
And so that is something that has been in my char@@ ac@@ ter for a long time .
"CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minu@@ te , the story : what happened in I@@ cel@@ and ?"
"You basically publi@@ shed something there , ran into t@@ rou@@ ble with a b@@ ank , then the news ser@@ vice there was in@@ j@@ un@@ cted from ru@@ n@@ ning the story ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , they publi@@ ci@@ zed your side ."
That made you very high-@@ pro@@ fi@@ le in I@@ cel@@ and . What happened next ?
"J@@ A : Yeah , this is a great case , you know ."
I@@ cel@@ and went through this fin@@ an@@ cial cri@@ sis .
It was the har@@ d@@ est h@@ it of any country in the world .
I@@ ts ban@@ king se@@ ctor was 10 times the G@@ D@@ P of the rest of the econom@@ y .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , so we rele@@ ase this re@@ port in Ju@@ ly last year ."
"And the national T@@ V st@@ ation was in@@ j@@ un@@ cted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : in@@ j@@ un@@ ction lan@@ ded on the news des@@ k , and the news re@@ a@@ der was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;"
"Well , we just show the we@@ b@@ site instead , for all that time , as a fil@@ ler , and we became very fam@@ ous in I@@ cel@@ and , went to I@@ cel@@ and and spo@@ ke about this issue ."
"And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a resul@@ t , working with I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans and some other inter@@ national leg@@ al exper@@ ts , we put together a new sort of pac@@ k@@ age of le@@ gi@@ sl@@ ation for I@@ cel@@ and to sort of become an of@@ f@@ sh@@ ore ha@@ ven for the f@@ ree pre@@ ss , with the stron@@ gest jour@@ n@@ ali@@ stic prote@@ ctions in the world , with a new N@@ obe@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ e@@ ch ."
"I@@ cel@@ and &apos;s a Nor@@ di@@ c country , so , like Nor@@ way , it &apos;s able to ta@@ p into the system ."
"And just a mon@@ th ago , this was pas@@ sed by the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ am@@ ent un@@ anim@@ ously ."
CA : W@@ ow .
"( Applause ) L@@ ast question , Ju@@ li@@ an ."
"When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more li@@ ke@@ ly to be Bi@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther ex@@ er@@ ting more control , more se@@ cre@@ cy , or us wat@@ ching Bi@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther , or it &apos;s just all to be pla@@ yed for either way ?"
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
"I mean , there &apos;s en@@ or@@ m@@ ous pres@@ su@@ res to har@@ mon@@ i@@ ze fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ e@@ ch le@@ gi@@ sl@@ ation and tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy le@@ gi@@ sl@@ ation around the world — within the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , between China and the United States ."
Wh@@ ich way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
"That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of ef@@ for@@ t , we can shi@@ ft it one way or the other ."
"CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m ref@@ le@@ cting the audience &apos;s op@@ ini@@ on to say , Ju@@ li@@ an , be car@@ e@@ ful , and all power to you ."
"J@@ A : Thank you , Ch@@ ris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )"
I feel incredi@@ bly lu@@ ck@@ y to be from a country that &apos;s gener@@ ally consi@@ der@@ ed to be the best place in the world to be a woman .
"In 19@@ 7@@ 5 , when I was seven years old , women in I@@ cel@@ and went on a stri@@ ke ."
"They did no work that day , whether they he@@ ld prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal j@@ ob@@ s or had the work of the home ."
They mar@@ ched into the cen@@ ter of R@@ ey@@ k@@ j@@ av@@ í@@ k — 90 percent of women parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed — and pe@@ ace@@ fully and in so@@ li@@ dar@@ ity asked for equ@@ ality .
"N@@ o@@ thing worked in I@@ cel@@ and that day , because nothing works when women are not at work ."
"( Applause ) F@@ i@@ ve years later , I@@ cel@@ and@@ ers had the cou@@ ra@@ ge to be the first country in the world to de@@ moc@@ r@@ ati@@ cally ele@@ ct a woman as their pre@@ si@@ dent ."
"I will never for@@ get this day , that P@@ resi@@ dent V@@ ig@@ d@@ í@@ s , as we know her by her first name , ste@@ pped out on the bal@@ con@@ y of her own home , a single mo@@ m with her d@@ aughter by her side as she had won ."
"( Applause ) This woman was an incredible ro@@ le model for me and everyone grow@@ ing up at that time , inclu@@ ding bo@@ ys ."
"S@@ he fre@@ qu@@ ently sh@@ ar@@ es the story of how a young bo@@ y appro@@ ach@@ ed her after a couple of terms in offi@@ ce and asked , &quot; &quot; C@@ an bo@@ ys really gro@@ w up to be pre@@ si@@ dent ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) R@@ ole mode@@ ls really matter , but even with such stron@@ g ro@@ le mode@@ ls who I am so gr@@ ate@@ ful for , when I was en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to run for pre@@ si@@ dent , my first re@@ action was , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o am I to run for pre@@ si@@ dent ?"
Wh@@ o am I to be pre@@ si@@ dent ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less li@@ ke@@ ly to consi@@ der ru@@ n@@ ning than men .
"So a study done in the U@@ S in 20@@ 11 show@@ ed that 6@@ 2 percent of men had consi@@ der@@ ed ru@@ n@@ ning for offi@@ ce , but 4@@ 5 percent of women ."
"That &apos;s ga@@ p of 16 per@@ cent@@ age poin@@ ts , and it &apos;s the same ga@@ p that ex@@ ist@@ ed a dec@@ ade ear@@ lie@@ r ."
"And it really is a sha@@ me , because I am so con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that the world is in real need for women le@@ ad@@ ers and more prin@@ ci@@ ple@@ -@@ based le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship in gener@@ al ."
"So my deci@@ sion to run ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely came down to the fact that I felt that I had to do my bit , even if I had no poli@@ tical experience , to ste@@ p up and try to be part of cre@@ ating the world that will make sense and be susta@@ in@@ able for our kids , and a world where we tru@@ ly al@@ low both our bo@@ ys and girls to be all they can be ."
And it was the jour@@ ney of my life .
It was amazing .
The jour@@ ney started with poten@@ ti@@ ally as many as 20 can@@ di@@ d@@ ates .
"It bo@@ i@@ led down to n@@ ine can@@ di@@ d@@ ates qu@@ ali@@ f@@ ying , and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely the rac@@ e came down to four of us , three men and me ."
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not all the dra@@ ma yet .
"You may think you have dra@@ ma in the U@@ S , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can as@@ sure you we had our own dra@@ ma in I@@ cel@@ and ."
"So our sitting pre@@ si@@ dent of 20 years an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced ini@@ ti@@ ally that he was not going to run , which is probably what gave ri@@ se to so many can@@ di@@ d@@ ates consi@@ der@@ ing ru@@ n@@ ning ."
Th@@ en later he changed his mind when our pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er re@@ sig@@ ned fol@@ low@@ ing the in@@ fam@@ ous P@@ an@@ ama P@@ a@@ per@@ s that im@@ p@@ lic@@ ated him and his family .
"And there was a popul@@ ar prote@@ st in I@@ cel@@ and , so the sitting pre@@ si@@ dent thought they needed a tru@@ st@@ ed lea@@ der ."
"A few days later , rel@@ ations to his wi@@ fe and her family &apos;s comp@@ an@@ ies were also disco@@ vered in the P@@ an@@ ama P@@ a@@ per@@ s , and so he with@@ dre@@ w from the rac@@ e again ."
"Be@@ fore doing so , he said he was doing that because now there were two qu@@ ali@@ f@@ ied men who he felt could fi@@ ll his sho@@ es ru@@ n@@ ning for offi@@ ce ."
"So on M@@ ay 9 , 4@@ 5 days before ele@@ ction day , it was not looking too good for me ."
I did not even make the gra@@ ph in the ne@@ wsp@@ ap@@ er .
"The pol@@ ls had me at 1 percent , but that was still the high@@ est that any woman an@@ n@@ oun@@ cing her can@@ di@@ d@@ acy had ear@@ ned ."
"So it would be an under@@ stat@@ ement to say that I had to work extre@@ me@@ ly hard to get my se@@ at at the table and ac@@ cess to tele@@ vision , because the network decided that they would only inclu@@ de those with 2@@ .@@ 5 percent or more in the pol@@ ls in the first T@@ V de@@ b@@ ate ."
"I found out on the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on of the first T@@ V de@@ b@@ ate that I would parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate along with the three men , and I found out on live T@@ V that I came in at exactly 2@@ .@@ 5 percent on the day of the first T@@ V de@@ b@@ ate ."
"( Applause ) So , challen@@ ges ."
"The fore@@ most challen@@ ges I had to face and over@@ come on this jour@@ ney had to do with media , mus@@ cle and money ."
Let &apos;s start with media .
There are those who say gen@@ der doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to media and poli@@ ti@@ cs .
I can &apos;t say that I ag@@ ree .
It pro@@ ved har@@ der for me to both get ac@@ cess and air@@ time in media .
"As a matter of fact , the le@@ ading can@@ di@@ d@@ ate ap@@ pe@@ ared in bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast media 8@@ 7 times in the months le@@ ading up to the ele@@ ctions , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as I ap@@ pe@@ ared 3@@ 1 times ."
And I am not saying media is doing this con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously .
"I think lar@@ ge@@ ly this has to do with un@@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous bi@@ as , because in media , much like every@@ where else , we have both con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous and un@@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous bi@@ as , and we need to have the cou@@ ra@@ ge to talk about it if we want to change it ."
"When I finally got ac@@ cess to T@@ V , the first question I got was , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you going to qu@@ it ? &quot; &quot; And that was a hard one ."
"But of course , with 1 percent to 2@@ .@@ 5 percent in the pol@@ ls , maybe it &apos;s under@@ stan@@ d@@ able ."
"But media really mat@@ ters , and every time I ap@@ pe@@ ared on T@@ V , we saw and exper@@ ien@@ ced a ri@@ se in the pol@@ ls , so I know fir@@ s@@ th@@ and how much this mat@@ ters and why we have to talk about it ."
I was the only one out of the fin@@ al four can@@ di@@ d@@ ates that never got a front p@@ age inter@@ view .
I was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other can@@ di@@ d@@ ates and out of co@@ ver@@ age about the ele@@ ctions .
"So I did face this , but I will say this to comp@@ li@@ ment the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c media ."
I got few if any com@@ ments about my ha@@ ir and pan@@ t@@ su@@ it .
( Applause ) So ku@@ do@@ s to them .
But there is another experience that &apos;s very important .
"I ran as an in@@ depen@@ dent can@@ di@@ d@@ ate , not with any poli@@ tical par@@ ty or mus@@ cle behind me ."
"That l@@ ack of experience and l@@ ack of ac@@ cess to re@@ sources probably came at a cost to our cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , but it also allow@@ ed us to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate and do poli@@ ti@@ cs differ@@ ently ."
"We ran a posi@@ tive cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , and we probably changed the t@@ one of the ele@@ ction for others by doing that ."
"It may be the reason why I had less air@@ time on T@@ V , because I wanted to show other con@@ ten@@ ders re@@ spe@@ ct ."
"When ac@@ cess to media pro@@ ved to be so difficult , we ran our own media ."
I ran live F@@ ace@@ book s@@ es@@ sions where I took questions from v@@ ot@@ ers on anything and respon@@ ded on the spo@@ t .
And we put all the questions I got and all the ans@@ w@@ ers on an open F@@ ace@@ book because we thought tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy is important if you want to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh tr@@ ust .
"And when re@@ ach@@ ing young v@@ ot@@ ers pro@@ ved to be challen@@ g@@ ing , I became a S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at@@ ter ."
"I got young people to te@@ ach me how to do that , and I used every fil@@ ter on S@@ na@@ p@@ ch@@ at during the last part of the cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n ."
"And I actually had to use a lot of hu@@ mo@@ r and hu@@ mili@@ ty , as I was very bad at it ."
But we gre@@ w the fol@@ low@@ ing am@@ on@@ g@@ st young people by doing that .
So it &apos;s possible to run a different ty@@ pe of cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
"But un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , one cannot talk about poli@@ ti@@ cs without men@@ tion@@ ing money ."
"I am sa@@ d that it is that way , but it &apos;s true , and we had less fin@@ an@@ cial re@@ sources than the other can@@ di@@ d@@ ates ."
This probably was par@@ tly du@@ e to the fact that I think I had a har@@ der time as@@ king for fin@@ an@@ cial sup@@ port .
And maybe I also had the am@@ bi@@ tion to do more with less .
S@@ ome would call that very wom@@ an@@ ly of me .
"But even with one third the media , one third the fin@@ an@@ cial re@@ sources , and only an ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ u@@ ri@@ al team , but an amazing team , we man@@ aged to sur@@ pri@@ se everyone on ele@@ ction night , when the first num@@ bers came in ."
"I sur@@ pri@@ sed myself , as you may see in that ph@@ oto ."
"( Laughter ) So the first num@@ bers , I came in ne@@ ck to ne@@ ck to the le@@ ading can@@ di@@ d@@ ate ."
"( Ch@@ e@@ ers ) Well , too early , because I didn &apos;t quite pu@@ ll that , but I came in second , and we went a long way from the one percent , with ne@@ ar@@ ly a third of the v@@ ot@@ e , and we be@@ at the pol@@ ls by an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted mar@@ g@@ in , or 10 per@@ cent@@ age poin@@ ts ab@@ o@@ ve what the last po@@ ll came in at ."
"S@@ ome people call me the real win@@ ner of the ele@@ ction because of this , and there are many people who en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed me to run again ."
"But what really makes me pro@@ u@@ d is to know that I ear@@ ned pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately high@@ er per@@ cent@@ age sup@@ port from the young people , and a lot of people en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed my d@@ aughter to run in 20@@ 40 ."
"( Applause ) She is 1@@ 3 , and she had never been on T@@ V before ."
"And on ele@@ ction day , I obser@@ ved her on T@@ V re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly , and she was s@@ mar@@ t , she was self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dent , she was sin@@ c@@ ere , and she was sup@@ por@@ tive of her mother ."
This was probably the high@@ light of my cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
"These are pres@@ cho@@ ol girls out on a walk , and they found a post@@ er of me on a bu@@ s stop , and they saw the need to k@@ is@@ s it ."
A@@ ud@@ ience : A@@ w !
This picture was really enough of a wi@@ n for me .
"What we see , we can be ."
So scre@@ w fe@@ ar and challen@@ ges .
"( Applause ) It mat@@ ters that women run , and it &apos;s time for women to run for offi@@ ce , be it the offi@@ ce of the C@@ E@@ O or the offi@@ ce of the pre@@ si@@ dent ."
"I also man@@ aged to put an im@@ pres@@ sion on your very own &quot; &quot; New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er . &quot; &quot; I ear@@ ned a new ti@@ tle , &quot; &quot; A living emo@@ ji of sin@@ c@@ eri@@ ty . &quot; &quot; ( Ch@@ e@@ ers ) It is possi@@ bly my pro@@ ud@@ est ti@@ tle yet , and the reason is that women too often get pen@@ aliz@@ ed for using what I call their emoti@@ onal ca@@ pi@@ tal , but I know from experience that we become so good when we do just that ."
( Applause ) And we need more of that .
"We ce@@ le@@ br@@ ated as if we had won on ele@@ ction night , because that &apos;s how we felt ."
So you don &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly have to re@@ ach that offi@@ ce .
"You just have to go for it , and you , your family , your friends , everyone working with you , if you do it well , you will gro@@ w be@@ y@@ ond anything you will experience before ."
"So we had a good time , and I learned a lot on this jour@@ ney , probably more l@@ ess@@ ons than I can share here in the time we have today ."
"But rest as@@ su@@ red , it was hard work ."
I lost a lot of sle@@ ep during those months .
"It took re@@ sil@@ ience and per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance to not qu@@ it , but I learned something that I knew before on the one percent day , and that is that you can only be good when you are tru@@ ly , au@@ th@@ enti@@ cally list@@ ening to your own vo@@ ice and working in ali@@ gn@@ ment with that ."
"As a good si@@ ster of m@@ ine sometimes says , you may che@@ at on your in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion , but your in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion never che@@ ats on you ."
"I think it &apos;s also very important , and you all know this , that on any jour@@ ney you go on , it &apos;s the team you take along ."
"It &apos;s having people around you who share your val@@ u@@ es , your vision , but are different in every other way ."
"That &apos;s the for@@ mu@@ la for suc@@ cess for me , and I am bl@@ ess@@ ed with an amazing h@@ us@@ b@@ and , here today , an incredible family — ( Applause ) and great friends , and we came together as ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s in the poli@@ tical ar@@ en@@ a , and pul@@ led something off that everyone said would be im@@ possible ."
"As a matter of fact , the le@@ ading P@@ R exper@@ t told me before I made my deci@@ sion that I would do well to get seven percent ."
"I ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated his perspe@@ ctive , because he was probably right , and he was bas@@ ing it on val@@ u@@ able experience ."
"But on the one percent day , I decided here to show him that he was wrong ."
"It &apos;s very important to men@@ tion this , because I did lo@@ se a lot of sle@@ ep , and I worked hard , and so did the people with me ."
We can never go the di@@ stance if we for@@ get to take care of ourselves .
"And it &apos;s two things that I think are very important in that , in sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding yourself with people and prac@@ ti@@ ces that n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh you , but it &apos;s equ@@ ally important , maybe even more important , to have the cou@@ ra@@ ge to get ri@@ d of people and prac@@ ti@@ ces that take away your energy , inclu@@ ding the wonderful blo@@ gg@@ ers and com@@ ment@@ at@@ ors ."
"I took a lot of sup@@ port from others in doing this , and I made the deci@@ sion to go high when others went low , and that &apos;s par@@ tly how I ke@@ pt my energy going throu@@ gh@@ out all of this ."
"And when I lost my energy for a moment — and I did from time to time , it wasn &apos;t e@@ asy — I went back to why I decided to run , and how I had decided to run my own rac@@ e ."
"I called it a 4@@ G cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , the G &apos;s re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c words ."
"And the first one is called &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n . &quot; &quot; I ran to do good , to be of ser@@ vice , and I wanted ser@@ v@@ ant le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship to be at the cen@@ ter of how I worked and everybody else in the cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n ."
"S@@ econ@@ d one is &quot; &quot; G@@ le@@ ð@@ i , &quot; &quot; or jo@@ y ."
I decided to en@@ jo@@ y the jour@@ ney .
"There was a lot to be taken out of the jour@@ ney , no matter if the de@@ st@@ in@@ ation was re@@ ach@@ ed or not ."
And I tr@@ ied my ut@@ most to inspi@@ re others to do so as well .
Th@@ ird is &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n@@ s@@ æ@@ i . &quot; &quot; I was open to any questions .
"I ke@@ pt no se@@ cre@@ ts , and it was all open , on F@@ ace@@ book and we@@ b@@ si@@ tes ."
"Because I think if you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing your pre@@ si@@ dent , you des@@ er@@ ve ans@@ w@@ ers to your questions ."
"L@@ ast but not least , I don &apos;t need to expla@@ in that in this room , we ran on the prin@@ ci@@ ple of G@@ ir@@ l@@ power ."
"( Ch@@ e@@ ers ) I am incredi@@ bly gl@@ ad that I had the cou@@ ra@@ ge to run , to ri@@ sk fai@@ lu@@ re but re@@ cei@@ ve suc@@ cess on so many le@@ v@@ els ."
"I can &apos;t tell you that it was e@@ asy , but I can tell you , and I think my entire team will ag@@ ree with me , that it was wor@@ th it ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
P@@ at M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell : I &apos;m not le@@ tting you go yet . H@@ al@@ la T@@ ó@@ mas@@ d@@ ó@@ t@@ ti@@ r : What a great c@@ row@@ d . P@@ M : I can &apos;t let you go without saying
that probably everybody in the room is ready to move to I@@ cel@@ and and v@@ ot@@ e for you .
"But of course we probably can &apos;t v@@ ot@@ e there , but one thing we can get from I@@ cel@@ and and have always got@@ ten is in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation ."
"I mean , I &apos;m old enough to remember 19@@ 7@@ 5 when all the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c women wal@@ ked out , and that really was a very big fac@@ tor in la@@ un@@ ching the women &apos;s movement ."
You made a re@@ fer@@ ence to it ear@@ lie@@ r . I &apos;d love to bring the picture back up and just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a stan@@ d@@ still .
"And then what you may not know because our American media did not re@@ port it , the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c women wal@@ ked out again on M@@ on@@ day . R@@ ight ?"
"H@@ T : Yes , they did . P@@ M : C@@ an you tell us about that ?"
"H@@ T : Yes , so 4@@ 1 years after the ori@@ gin@@ al stri@@ ke , we may be the best place in the world to be a woman , but our work isn &apos;t done ."
"So at 2 : 3@@ 8@@ p@@ m on M@@ on@@ day , women in I@@ cel@@ and left work , because that &apos;s when they had ear@@ ned their day &apos;s s@@ al@@ ary ."
"( Applause ) What &apos;s really cool about this is that young women and men parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed in gre@@ ater num@@ bers than before , because it is time that we close the pay ga@@ p ."
"P@@ M : So I &apos;m not going to ask H@@ al@@ la to comm@@ it right now to what she &apos;s doing next , but I will say that you &apos;d have a very large vol@@ un@@ te@@ er ar@@ my should you deci@@ de to do that again ."
Thank you H@@ al@@ la .

"When I was a stud@@ ent here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , the future of the world was b@@ le@@ ak ."
The popul@@ ation ex@@ plo@@ sion was un@@ stop@@ p@@ able .
G@@ lob@@ al fam@@ ine was in@@ evi@@ table .
A can@@ cer epi@@ demi@@ c ca@@ used by chemi@@ cal@@ s in the environment was going to shor@@ ten our lives .
The ac@@ id ra@@ in was fal@@ ling on the fore@@ sts .
The des@@ er@@ t was adv@@ an@@ cing by a mi@@ le or two a year .
"The oil was ru@@ n@@ ning out , and a nuclear win@@ ter would fin@@ is@@ h us off ."
"N@@ one of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly , if you look at what actually happened in my li@@ fe@@ time , the a@@ ver@@ age per@@ -@@ ca@@ pi@@ ta in@@ come of the a@@ ver@@ age person on the planet , in real terms , ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ed for in@@ fl@@ ation , has tri@@ p@@ led ."
Li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an is up by 30 percent in my li@@ fe@@ time .
Chi@@ ld mor@@ t@@ ality is down by two@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ ds .
P@@ er@@ -@@ ca@@ pi@@ ta food produ@@ ction is up by a third .
And all this at a time when the popul@@ ation has d@@ ou@@ b@@ led .
"H@@ ow did we ach@@ ie@@ ve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?"
How did we ach@@ ie@@ ve that ?
How did we become the only species that be@@ comes more pro@@ sp@@ er@@ ous as it be@@ comes more popul@@ ous ?
"The size of the blo@@ b in this gra@@ ph re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts the size of the popul@@ ation , and the level of the gra@@ ph re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ts G@@ D@@ P per ca@@ pi@@ ta ."
"I think to answer that question you need to understand how human be@@ ings bring together their bra@@ ins and en@@ able their ideas to com@@ b@@ ine and re@@ com@@ b@@ ine , to me@@ et and , in@@ de@@ ed , to m@@ ate ."
"In other words , you need to understand how ideas have se@@ x ."
I want you to imagine how we got from making obje@@ cts like this to making obje@@ cts like this .
These are both real obje@@ cts .
One is an A@@ che@@ u@@ le@@ an hand ax@@ e from half a million years ago of the kind made by H@@ om@@ o er@@ e@@ ctu@@ s .
The other is obvi@@ ously a computer m@@ ou@@ se .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and sha@@ pe to an un@@ can@@ ny de@@ gre@@ e .
"I &apos;ve tr@@ ied to work out which is bi@@ g@@ ger , and it &apos;s almost im@@ possible ."
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both desig@@ ned to f@@ it the human hand .
"They &apos;re both technolog@@ ies . In the end , their si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ity is not that interesting ."
It just tel@@ ls you they were both desig@@ ned to f@@ it the human hand .
"The differ@@ ences are what inter@@ est me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty un@@ v@@ ar@@ ying design for about a million years — from one@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half million years ago to half a million years ago ."
"H@@ om@@ o er@@ e@@ ctu@@ s made the same to@@ ol for 3@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations ."
"O@@ f course there were a few chang@@ es , but to@@ ols changed s@@ low@@ er than sk@@ ele@@ t@@ ons in those days ."
"There was no pro@@ gre@@ ss , no in@@ no@@ vation ."
"It &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on , but it &apos;s true ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the obje@@ ct on the right is ob@@ so@@ le@@ te after five years .
"And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the obje@@ ct on the left is made from one sub@@ stance ."
"The obje@@ ct on the right is made from a con@@ fe@@ ction of different sub@@ stan@@ ces , from si@@ lic@@ on and me@@ tal and pla@@ stic and so on ."
"And more than that , it &apos;s a con@@ fe@@ ction of different ideas , the idea of pla@@ stic , the idea of a las@@ er , the idea of tran@@ si@@ stor@@ s ."
They &apos;ve all been com@@ b@@ ined together in this technology .
"And it &apos;s this com@@ bin@@ ation , this cu@@ mul@@ ative technology , that in@@ tri@@ gu@@ es me , because I think it &apos;s the se@@ cre@@ t to under@@ standing what &apos;s happening in the world ."
"My body &apos;s an ac@@ cu@@ mul@@ ation of ideas too : the idea of sk@@ in cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of li@@ ver cells ."
They &apos;ve come together .
"H@@ ow does ev@@ olution do cu@@ mul@@ ative , com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al things ?"
"Well , it uses se@@ x@@ u@@ al re@@ produ@@ ction ."
"In an as@@ ex@@ u@@ al species , if you get two different mu@@ t@@ ations in different cre@@ at@@ ures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other ."
One goes ex@@ t@@ in@@ ct for the other to survi@@ ve .
"But if you have a se@@ x@@ u@@ al species , then it &apos;s possible for an individu@@ al to in@@ her@@ it both mu@@ t@@ ations from different lin@@ e@@ ages ."
So what se@@ x does is it en@@ ab@@ les the individu@@ al to dra@@ w upo@@ n the gen@@ e@@ tic in@@ no@@ v@@ ations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not con@@ fin@@ ed to its own lin@@ e@@ age .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effe@@ ct in cul@@ tu@@ ral ev@@ olution as se@@ x is having in biologi@@ cal ev@@ olution ?
"And I think the answer is ex@@ change , the ha@@ bit of ex@@ chang@@ ing one thing for another ."
It &apos;s a uni@@ qu@@ e human fe@@ ature .
No other ani@@ mal does it .
You can te@@ ach them in the labor@@ at@@ ory to do a little bit of ex@@ change — and in@@ de@@ ed there &apos;s re@@ ci@@ pro@@ city in other animals — But the ex@@ change of one obje@@ ct for another never happens .
"As A@@ d@@ am S@@ mi@@ th said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a do@@ g make a fa@@ ir ex@@ change of a b@@ one with another do@@ g . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without ex@@ change ."
"You can have , as it were , as@@ ex@@ u@@ al culture ."
"C@@ hi@@ m@@ pan@@ ze@@ es , kil@@ ler wh@@ al@@ es , these kinds of cre@@ at@@ ures , they have culture ."
They te@@ ach each other tra@@ di@@ tions which are h@@ an@@ ded down from par@@ ent to of@@ f@@ sp@@ ring .
"In this case , ch@@ im@@ pan@@ ze@@ es teach@@ ing each other how to c@@ rac@@ k nu@@ ts with ro@@ cks ."
"But the difference is that these cul@@ tu@@ res never ex@@ p@@ and , never gro@@ w , never ac@@ cu@@ mul@@ ate , never become com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al , and the reason is because there is no se@@ x , as it were , there is no ex@@ change of ideas ."
Chi@@ m@@ pan@@ ze@@ e tro@@ op@@ s have different cul@@ tu@@ res in different tro@@ op@@ s .
There &apos;s no ex@@ change of ideas between them .
And why does ex@@ change ra@@ ise living stan@@ dar@@ ds ?
"Well , the answer came from Davi@@ d Ri@@ car@@ do in 1@@ 8@@ 1@@ 7 ."
"And here is a St@@ one A@@ ge ver@@ sion of his story , al@@ though he told it in terms of tra@@ de between countries ."
A@@ d@@ am takes four hours to make a spe@@ ar and three hours to make an ax@@ e .
O@@ z takes one hour to make a spe@@ ar and two hours to make an ax@@ e .
So O@@ z is better at both spe@@ ars and ax@@ es than A@@ d@@ am .
He doesn &apos;t need A@@ d@@ am .
He can make his own spe@@ ars and ax@@ es .
"Well no , because if you think about it , if O@@ z makes two spe@@ ars and A@@ d@@ am make two ax@@ es , and then they tra@@ de , then they will each have sa@@ ved an hour of work ."
"And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better A@@ d@@ am is going to get at making ax@@ es and the better O@@ z is going to get at making spe@@ ars ."
So the ga@@ ins from tra@@ de are only going to gro@@ w .
"And this is one of the beau@@ ties of ex@@ change , is it actually cre@@ ates the mom@@ entu@@ m for more speci@@ aliz@@ ation , which cre@@ ates the mom@@ entu@@ m for more ex@@ change and so on ."
A@@ d@@ am and O@@ z both sa@@ ved an hour of time .
"That is pro@@ sp@@ eri@@ ty , the sa@@ ving of time in s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying your needs ."
A@@ sk yourself how long you would have to work to provi@@ de for yourself an hour of re@@ ading light this ev@@ ening to read a book by .
"If you had to start from sc@@ rat@@ ch , let &apos;s say you go out into the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
You find a sh@@ e@@ ep . You ki@@ ll it . You get the f@@ at out of it .
"You ren@@ der it down . You make a c@@ and@@ le , et@@ c@@ . et@@ c ."
How long is it going to take you ? Q@@ u@@ i@@ te a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to ear@@ n an hour of re@@ ading light if you &apos;re on the a@@ ver@@ age wa@@ ge in Bri@@ tain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
"B@@ ack in 19@@ 50 , you would have had to work for eight secon@@ ds on the a@@ ver@@ age wa@@ ge to ac@@ qui@@ re that much light ."
"And that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds of pro@@ sp@@ eri@@ ty that you &apos;ve ga@@ ined since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds in which you can do something else , or you can ac@@ qui@@ re another good or ser@@ vice ."
"And back in 1@@ 8@@ 80 , it would have been 15 minutes to ear@@ n that amount of light on the a@@ ver@@ age wa@@ ge ."
"B@@ ack in 1@@ 8@@ 00 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to ear@@ n a c@@ and@@ le that could bur@@ n for an hour ."
"In other words , the a@@ ver@@ age person on the a@@ ver@@ age wa@@ ge could not af@@ for@@ d a c@@ and@@ le in 1@@ 8@@ 00 ."
"G@@ o back to this image of the ax@@ e and the m@@ ou@@ se , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The st@@ one ax@@ e was made by someone for hi@@ m@@ self ."
It was self-@@ su@@ f@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy .
We call that po@@ ver@@ ty these days .
But the obje@@ ct on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
T@@ ens ? H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds ? Th@@ ous@@ ands ?
"You know , I think it &apos;s probably mi@@ llions ."
"Because you &apos;ve got to inclu@@ de the man who gre@@ w the co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , which was bre@@ w@@ ed for the man who was on the oil ri@@ g , who was dri@@ l@@ ling for oil , which was going to be made into the pla@@ stic , et@@ c ."
"They were all working for me , to make a m@@ ou@@ se for me ."
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve ach@@ ie@@ ved as a species .
"In the old days , if you were ri@@ ch , you liter@@ ally had people working for you ."
That &apos;s how you got to be ri@@ ch ; you em@@ plo@@ yed them .
L@@ ou@@ is X@@ IV had a lot of people working for him .
"They made his sil@@ ly out@@ fi@@ ts , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his sil@@ ly ha@@ ir@@ sty@@ les , or whatever ."
He had 4@@ 9@@ 8 people to pre@@ p@@ are his din@@ ner every night .
"But a moder@@ n tou@@ ri@@ st going around the pal@@ ace of V@@ er@@ sa@@ il@@ les and looking at L@@ ou@@ is X@@ IV &apos;s pi@@ ctures , he has 4@@ 9@@ 8 people doing his din@@ ner ton@@ ight too ."
"They &apos;re in bi@@ stro@@ s and ca@@ f@@ es and re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts and sh@@ op@@ s all over Par@@ is , and they &apos;re all ready to ser@@ ve you at an hour &apos;s noti@@ ce with an ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent me@@ al that &apos;s probably got high@@ er qu@@ ality than L@@ ou@@ is X@@ IV even had ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other ."
We &apos;re able to dra@@ w upo@@ n speci@@ aliz@@ ation and ex@@ change to ra@@ ise each other &apos;s living stan@@ dar@@ ds .
"Now , you do get other animals working for each other too ."
An@@ ts are a clas@@ si@@ c example ; wor@@ k@@ ers work for qu@@ e@@ ens and qu@@ e@@ ens work for wor@@ k@@ ers .
"But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the col@@ ony ."
There &apos;s no working for each other across the col@@ on@@ ies .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a re@@ produ@@ ctive di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
"That is to say , they speci@@ ali@@ ze with re@@ spe@@ ct to re@@ produ@@ ction ."
The qu@@ e@@ en does it all .
"In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that ."
"It &apos;s the one thing we in@@ si@@ st on doing for ourselves , is re@@ produ@@ ction ."
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven in En@@ gl@@ and , we don &apos;t leave re@@ produ@@ ction to the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en ."
( Applause ) So when did this ha@@ bit start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think , probably , the ol@@ d@@ est ver@@ sion of this is probably the se@@ x@@ u@@ al di@@ vision of lab@@ or ."
But I &apos;ve got no evi@@ dence for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work m@@ ale for fe@@ m@@ ale and fe@@ m@@ ale for m@@ ale .
"In all hun@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ er socie@@ ties today , there &apos;s a for@@ ag@@ ing di@@ vision of lab@@ or between , on the whole , hun@@ ting mal@@ es and ga@@ ther@@ ing fe@@ mal@@ es ."
"It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a di@@ st@@ in@@ ction between speci@@ aliz@@ ed ro@@ les for mal@@ es and fe@@ mal@@ es ."
And the beau@@ ty of this system is that it b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts both si@@ des .
"The woman know@@ s that , in the Ha@@ d@@ z@@ as &apos; case here — di@@ gg@@ ing ro@@ ots to share with men in ex@@ change for me@@ at — she know@@ s that all she has to do to get ac@@ cess to prote@@ in is to di@@ g some ex@@ tra ro@@ ots and tra@@ de them for me@@ at ."
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ing hun@@ t and try and ki@@ ll a war@@ th@@ o@@ g .
And the man know@@ s that he doesn &apos;t have to do any di@@ gg@@ ing to get ro@@ ots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he kil@@ ls a war@@ th@@ o@@ g it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both si@@ des ra@@ ise each other &apos;s stan@@ dar@@ ds of living through the se@@ x@@ u@@ al di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
"When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do this ."
They were a high@@ ly co@@ oper@@ ative species .
They were a high@@ ly inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent species .
"Th@@ e@@ ir bra@@ ins on a@@ ver@@ age , by the end , were bi@@ g@@ ger than y@@ ours and m@@ ine in this room today ."
They were imag@@ in@@ ative . They bur@@ ied their de@@ ad .
"They had language , probably , because we know they had the F@@ O@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gen@@ e of the same kind as us , which was disco@@ vered here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d ."
And so it looks like they probably had lin@@ gu@@ i@@ stic sk@@ il@@ ls .
They were bri@@ lli@@ ant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als .
But there &apos;s no evi@@ dence of a se@@ x@@ u@@ al di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
There &apos;s no evi@@ dence of ga@@ ther@@ ing behavi@@ or by fe@@ mal@@ es .
It looks like the fe@@ mal@@ es were co@@ oper@@ ative hun@@ ters with the men .
"And the other thing there &apos;s no evi@@ dence for is ex@@ change between grou@@ ps , because the obje@@ cts that you find in Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al re@@ ma@@ ins , the to@@ ols they made , are always made from local materi@@ als ."
"For example , in the C@@ au@@ c@@ as@@ us there &apos;s a site where you find local Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al to@@ ols ."
They &apos;re always made from local ch@@ er@@ t .
"In the same val@@ ley there are moder@@ n human re@@ ma@@ ins from about the same d@@ ate , 3@@ 0,000 years ago , and some of those are from local ch@@ er@@ t , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ si@@ di@@ an from a long way away ."
"And when human be@@ ings began moving obje@@ cts around like this , it was evi@@ dence that they were ex@@ chang@@ ing between grou@@ ps ."
T@@ ra@@ de is 10 times as old as far@@ ming .
Pe@@ ople for@@ get that . Pe@@ ople think of tra@@ de as a moder@@ n thing .
E@@ x@@ change between grou@@ ps has been going on for a hundre@@ d thous@@ and years .
"And the ear@@ lie@@ st evi@@ dence for it cro@@ ps up some@@ where between 80 and 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ago in Africa , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and j@@ as@@ per and other things moving long di@@ stan@@ ces in E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia ."
You also see se@@ as@@ hel@@ ls — as disco@@ vered by a team here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d — moving 1@@ 25 miles in@@ land from the Me@@ di@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an in Al@@ g@@ eri@@ a .
And that &apos;s evi@@ dence that people have started ex@@ chang@@ ing between grou@@ ps .
And that will have led to speci@@ aliz@@ ation .
How do you know that lon@@ g@@ -@@ di@@ stance movement means tra@@ de rather than mi@@ gr@@ ation ?
"Well , you look at moder@@ n hun@@ ter ga@@ ther@@ ers like ab@@ ori@@ gin@@ als , who qu@@ ar@@ ried for st@@ one ax@@ es at a place called M@@ oun@@ t I@@ sa , which was a qu@@ ar@@ ry ow@@ ned by the K@@ al@@ k@@ ad@@ o@@ on tri@@ be ."
"They tra@@ ded them with their neigh@@ b@@ ors for things like st@@ in@@ gra@@ y bar@@ b@@ s , and the con@@ sequ@@ ence was that st@@ one ax@@ es en@@ ded up over a large part of Au@@ str@@ ali@@ a ."
"So lon@@ g@@ -@@ di@@ stance movement of to@@ ols is a sig@@ n of tra@@ de , not mi@@ gr@@ ation ."
"What happens when you cut people off from ex@@ change , from the ability to ex@@ change and speci@@ ali@@ ze ?"
"And the answer is that not only do you s@@ low down technologi@@ cal pro@@ gre@@ ss , you can actually th@@ row it into re@@ verse ."
A@@ n example is T@@ as@@ m@@ ania .
"When the se@@ a level ro@@ se and T@@ as@@ m@@ ania became an is@@ land 1@@ 0,000 years ago , the people on it not only exper@@ ien@@ ced s@@ low@@ er pro@@ gre@@ ss than people on the ma@@ in@@ land , they actually exper@@ ien@@ ced re@@ gre@@ ss ."
"They gave up the ability to make st@@ one to@@ ols and fi@@ sh@@ ing e@@ qui@@ pment and clo@@ thing because the popul@@ ation of about 4@@ ,000 people was simply not large enough to ma@@ in@@ tain the speci@@ aliz@@ ed sk@@ il@@ ls ne@@ cess@@ ary to keep the technology they had ."
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a des@@ er@@ t is@@ land .
"H@@ ow many of the things in our po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts could we contin@@ ue to make after 1@@ 0,000 years ?"
"It didn &apos;t happen in T@@ ier@@ ra de@@ l F@@ u@@ ego — si@@ mi@@ lar is@@ land , si@@ mi@@ lar people ."
"The reason : because T@@ ier@@ ra de@@ l F@@ u@@ ego is se@@ par@@ ated from S@@ outh America by a much nar@@ row@@ er stra@@ ight , and there was tra@@ ding cont@@ act across that stra@@ ight throu@@ gh@@ out 1@@ 0,000 years ."
The T@@ as@@ m@@ ani@@ ans were is@@ ol@@ ated .
"G@@ o back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it ."
"In the case of the st@@ one ax@@ e , the man who made it knew how to make it ."
But who know@@ s how to make a computer m@@ ou@@ se ?
"N@@ ob@@ ody , liter@@ ally no@@ body ."
There is no@@ body on the planet who know@@ s how to make a computer m@@ ou@@ se .
I mean this quite seri@@ ously .
The pre@@ si@@ dent of the computer m@@ ou@@ se company doesn &apos;t know .
He just know@@ s how to run a company .
"The person on the as@@ se@@ m@@ bly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to dri@@ ll an oil well to get oil out to make pla@@ stic , and so on ."
"We all know little bi@@ ts , but n@@ one of us know@@ s the whole ."
"I am of course quot@@ ing from a fam@@ ous es@@ say by Le@@ on@@ ard Re@@ ad , the econ@@ omi@@ st in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , called &quot; &quot; I , P@@ en@@ ci@@ l &quot; &quot; in which he wro@@ te about how a pen@@ ci@@ l came to be made , and how no@@ body know@@ s even how to make a pen@@ ci@@ l , because the people who as@@ se@@ m@@ ble it don &apos;t know how to m@@ ine gra@@ phi@@ te , and they don &apos;t know how to fe@@ ll tre@@ es and that kind of thing ."
"And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through ex@@ change and speci@@ aliz@@ ation , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand ."
It &apos;s not the same with language .
Wi@@ th language we have to trans@@ f@@ er ideas that we understand with each other .
"But with technology , we can actually do things that are be@@ y@@ ond our cap@@ abi@@ lit@@ ies ."
We &apos;ve gone be@@ y@@ ond the ca@@ pac@@ ity of the human mind to an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary de@@ gre@@ e .
"And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons that I &apos;m not interested in the de@@ b@@ ate about I@@ .@@ Q@@ . , about whether some grou@@ ps have high@@ er I@@ .@@ Q@@ .@@ s than other grou@@ ps ."
It &apos;s completely ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant .
"What &apos;s rele@@ v@@ ant to a society is how well people are communi@@ c@@ ating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re co@@ oper@@ ating , not how cle@@ ver the individu@@ als are ."
So we &apos;ve created something called the colle@@ ctive brain .
We &apos;re just the no@@ des in the network .
We &apos;re the neuron@@ s in this brain .
"It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the me@@ e@@ ting and mat@@ ing of ideas between them , that is ca@@ using technologi@@ cal pro@@ gre@@ ss , incre@@ ment@@ ally , bit by bit ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , bad things happen ."
"And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terri@@ ble things ."
There will be war@@ s ; there will be de@@ pres@@ sions ; there will be natural disa@@ st@@ ers .
"A@@ w@@ ful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolu@@ tely sure ."
"But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the conne@@ ctions people are making , and the ability of ideas to me@@ et and to m@@ ate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will adv@@ ance , and ther@@ e@@ fore living stan@@ dar@@ ds will adv@@ ance ."
"Because through the cl@@ ou@@ d , through c@@ row@@ d sour@@ cing , through the bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the e@@ li@@ tes but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them me@@ et and m@@ ate , we are su@@ re@@ ly ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating the r@@ ate of in@@ no@@ vation ."
Thank you .

Go@@ od af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .

My name is Am@@ it .
"And 18 months ago , I had another job at Go@@ og@@ le , and I pit@@ ched this idea of doing something with mus@@ e@@ um@@ s and art to my b@@ os@@ s who &apos;s actually here , and she allow@@ ed me to do it ."
And it took 18 months .
"A lot of fun , neg@@ oti@@ ations and stories , I can tell you , with 1@@ 7 very interesting mus@@ e@@ um@@ s from n@@ ine countries ."
But I &apos;m going to fo@@ cus on the de@@ mo .
There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
"I think my per@@ s@@ onal story is expla@@ ined very simply on the sli@@ de , and it &apos;s ac@@ cess ."
And I gre@@ w up in Indi@@ a .
I had a great education — I &apos;m not com@@ pla@@ ining — but I didn &apos;t have ac@@ cess to a lot of these mus@@ e@@ um@@ s and these ar@@ t@@ works .
"And so when I started tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing and going to these mus@@ e@@ um@@ s , I started lear@@ ning a lot ."
"And while working at Go@@ og@@ le , I tr@@ ied to put this de@@ si@@ re to make it more ac@@ ces@@ si@@ ble with technology together ."
"So we form@@ ed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this ."
I &apos;m going to probably get into the de@@ mo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since la@@ un@@ ch .
"So , simple : you come to Go@@ og@@ le@@ Ar@@ t@@ Pro@@ je@@ ct@@ .@@ com@@ ."
You look around at all these mus@@ e@@ um@@ s here .
"You &apos;ve got the U@@ f@@ fi@@ z@@ i , you &apos;ve got the Mo@@ M@@ A , the H@@ er@@ mi@@ t@@ age , the Ri@@ j@@ ks , the V@@ an G@@ og@@ h ."
"I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ tes , the Me@@ tro@@ po@@ lit@@ an M@@ us@@ e@@ um of Ar@@ t in New York ."
T@@ wo ways of going in — very simple .

"It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — B@@ om@@ b@@ ay , M@@ exi@@ co , it doesn &apos;t really matter ."

"You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or ."
K@@ e@@ ep going . Ha@@ ve fun .
E@@ x@@ pl@@ ore .
( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks . I ha@@ ven &apos;t come to the best part .
"( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te pain@@ t@@ ings , &quot; &quot; The H@@ ar@@ v@@ est@@ ers &quot; &quot; by P@@ ie@@ ter B@@ ru@@ e@@ ge@@ l at the M@@ et ."
I see this p@@ lu@@ s sig@@ n .
"If the mus@@ e@@ um has given us the image , you cli@@ ck on it ."
Now this is one of the images .
So this is all of the me@@ ta@@ -@@ data information .
"For those of you who are tru@@ ly interested in art , you can cli@@ ck this — but I &apos;m going to cli@@ ck this off right now ."
And this is one of these images that we cap@@ tu@@ red in what we call gi@@ ga@@ pi@@ x@@ el technology .
"So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ."
And I get a lot of people as@@ king me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
You can z@@ o@@ om around very simply .
You see some fun stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his ex@@ pres@@ sion is pri@@ cel@@ ess .
But then you really want to go de@@ ep .
"And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here ."
"And I was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ old on . That sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; W@@ ent in , and I started noti@@ cing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something ."
"I did a little research , spo@@ ke to a couple of my cont@@ ac@@ ts at the M@@ et , and actually found out that this is a g@@ ame called squ@@ all , which inv@@ ol@@ ves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a sti@@ ck on S@@ h@@ ro@@ ve T@@ u@@ es@@ day ."
And ap@@ par@@ ently it was quite popul@@ ar .
"I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it ."
"Now just to get really de@@ ep in , you can really get to the c@@ rac@@ ks ."
"Now just to give you some perspe@@ ctive , I &apos;m going to z@@ o@@ om out so you really see what you get ."
"H@@ ere is where we were , and this is the pain@@ ting ."
( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
"So now let &apos;s just quickly j@@ um@@ p into the Mo@@ M@@ A , again in New York ."
"So another one of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ tes , &quot; &quot; The St@@ ar@@ ry N@@ ight . &quot; &quot; Now the example I show@@ ed you was all about fin@@ ding de@@ ta@@ il@@ s ."
But what if you want to see br@@ us@@ h stro@@ k@@ es ?
And what if you want to see how V@@ an G@@ og@@ h actually created this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
You z@@ o@@ om in . You really go in .
"I &apos;m going to go to one of my fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te par@@ ts in this pain@@ ting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the c@@ rac@@ ks ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The St@@ ar@@ ry N@@ ight , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before ."
I &apos;m going to show you my other fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te fe@@ ature .
"There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time ."
This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Col@@ le@@ ctions .
"A@@ ny one of you , any@@ body — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re ri@@ ch , if you &apos;re po@@ or , if you have a fan@@ cy house — doesn &apos;t matter ."
You can go and create your own mus@@ e@@ um on@@ line — create your own colle@@ ction across all these images .
"@@ V@@ ery simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Pow@@ er of Z@@ o@@ om — you can just z@@ o@@ om around ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The Am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ ors , &quot; &quot; based in the N@@ ational G@@ al@@ l@@ ery ."
"You can an@@ not@@ ate the stuff , sen@@ d it to your friends and really get a convers@@ ation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these ma@@ ster@@ pie@@ ces ."
"So I think , in con@@ clu@@ sion , for me , the ma@@ in thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Go@@ og@@ le ."
"It doesn &apos;t , in my op@@ ini@@ on , even come from the mus@@ e@@ um@@ s ."
I probably sh@@ ouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these arti@@ sts .
And that &apos;s been my hum@@ b@@ ling experience in this .
"I mean , I hope in this di@@ gi@@ tal medi@@ um that we do ju@@ sti@@ ce to their ar@@ t@@ work and re@@ present it pro@@ per@@ ly on@@ line ."
"And the bi@@ ggest question I get asked now@@ ad@@ a@@ ys is , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you do this to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate the experience of going to a mus@@ e@@ um ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no ."
It &apos;s to su@@ pp@@ le@@ ment the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler .
"That &apos;s what I do in life — tel@@ ling stories , writing no@@ v@@ els — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ling and also some super@@ natural cre@@ at@@ ures called the d@@ j@@ in@@ ni ."
"But before I go there , ple@@ ase al@@ low me to share with you g@@ lim@@ p@@ ses of my per@@ s@@ onal story ."
"I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a ge@@ ome@@ tri@@ cal sha@@ pe , the cir@@ cle , so throu@@ gh@@ out my talk , you will come across se@@ ver@@ al cir@@ cles ."
"I was born in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ our@@ g , Fran@@ ce to T@@ ur@@ k@@ is@@ h parents ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , my parents got se@@ par@@ ated , and I came to T@@ ur@@ key with my mo@@ m ."
"F@@ ro@@ m then on , I was ra@@ is@@ ed as a single child by a single mother ."
"Now in the early 19@@ 7@@ 0s , in An@@ kar@@ a , that was a bit un@@ usu@@ al ."
"O@@ ur neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od was full of large fam@@ il@@ ies , where fa@@ thers were the he@@ ads of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , so I gre@@ w up seeing my mother as a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce@@ e in a pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch@@ al environment ."
"In fact , I gre@@ w up obser@@ ving two different kinds of wom@@ an@@ ho@@ od ."
"O@@ n the one hand was my mother , a wel@@ l-@@ edu@@ c@@ ated , se@@ cular , moder@@ n , we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zed , T@@ ur@@ k@@ is@@ h woman ."
"O@@ n the other hand was my grand@@ mother , who also took care of me and was more spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al , less edu@@ c@@ ated and defini@@ tely less r@@ ational ."
This was a woman who read co@@ f@@ fe@@ e gro@@ un@@ ds to see the future and me@@ l@@ ted le@@ ad into m@@ yst@@ eri@@ ous sha@@ p@@ es to f@@ end off the evi@@ l ey@@ e .
"M@@ any people visi@@ ted my grand@@ mother , people with se@@ v@@ ere ac@@ ne on their fac@@ es or war@@ ts on their h@@ ands ."
"E@@ ach time , my grand@@ mother would ut@@ ter some words in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c , take a red app@@ le and sta@@ b it with as many ro@@ se th@@ or@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to re@@ move ."
"Th@@ en one by one , she would en@@ cir@@ cle these th@@ or@@ ns with dar@@ k in@@ k ."
"A week later , the patien@@ t would come back for a fol@@ low@@ -@@ up exam@@ in@@ ation ."
"Now , I &apos;m aw@@ are that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of sch@@ ol@@ ars and scienti@@ sts , but the tru@@ th is , of all the people who visi@@ ted my grand@@ mother for their sk@@ in con@@ di@@ tions , I did not see any@@ one go back un@@ happy or un@@ heal@@ ed ."
I asked her how she did this . W@@ as it the power of pra@@ ying ?
"In respon@@ se she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , pra@@ ying is effe@@ ctive , but also be@@ w@@ are of the power of cir@@ cles . &quot; &quot; F@@ ro@@ m her , I learned , am@@ on@@ g@@ st many other things , one very pre@@ ci@@ ous l@@ es@@ son — that if you want to de@@ stro@@ y something in this life , be it an ac@@ ne , a b@@ le@@ mi@@ sh or the human s@@ ou@@ l , all you need to do is to sur@@ round it with thi@@ ck wal@@ ls ."
It will d@@ ry up inside .
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cul@@ tu@@ ral cir@@ cle .
We all do .
"We &apos;re born into a certain family , n@@ ation , clas@@ s ."
"But if we have no conne@@ ction wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever with the wor@@ l@@ ds be@@ y@@ ond the one we take for gran@@ ted , then we too run the ri@@ sk of d@@ ry@@ ing up inside ."
"O@@ ur imag@@ in@@ ation might sh@@ r@@ in@@ k ; our hear@@ ts might d@@ win@@ d@@ le , and our hum@@ an@@ ness might wi@@ ther if we st@@ ay for too long inside our cul@@ tu@@ ral co@@ co@@ ons ."
"O@@ ur friends , neigh@@ b@@ ors , colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es , family — if all the people in our in@@ ner cir@@ cle re@@ se@@ m@@ ble us , it means we are sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded with our mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r image ."
Now one other thing women like my grand@@ ma do in T@@ ur@@ key is to co@@ ver mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r@@ s with v@@ el@@ v@@ et or to h@@ an@@ g them on the wal@@ ls with their bac@@ ks fac@@ ing out .
It &apos;s an old E@@ ast@@ er@@ n tra@@ di@@ tion based on the know@@ le@@ dge that it &apos;s not health@@ y for a human being to spend too much time star@@ ing at his own ref@@ le@@ ction .
"I@@ ro@@ ni@@ cally , &#91; living in &#93; communi@@ ties of the li@@ ke@@ -@@ min@@ ded is one of the gre@@ at@@ est d@@ ang@@ ers of today &apos;s glob@@ aliz@@ ed world ."
"And it &apos;s happening every@@ where , am@@ ong li@@ ber@@ als and con@@ ser@@ v@@ ati@@ ves , ag@@ no@@ sti@@ cs and belie@@ ver@@ s , the ri@@ ch and the po@@ or , E@@ ast and W@@ est ali@@ ke ."
"We ten@@ d to form clu@@ st@@ ers based on si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ity , and then we produ@@ ce ster@@ e@@ oty@@ p@@ es about other clu@@ st@@ ers of people ."
"In my op@@ ini@@ on , one way of tran@@ scen@@ ding these cul@@ tu@@ ral gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is through the art of stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ling ."
"S@@ tor@@ ies cannot demo@@ li@@ sh fron@@ t@@ ier@@ s , but they can pun@@ ch ho@@ les in our ment@@ al wal@@ ls ."
"And through those ho@@ les , we can get a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of the other , and sometimes even like what we see ."
I started writing fi@@ ction at the age of eight .
My mother came home one day with a tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise not@@ e@@ book and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in ke@@ e@@ ping a per@@ s@@ onal jour@@ na@@ l .
"In re@@ tro@@ spe@@ ct , I think she was sli@@ gh@@ tly wor@@ ried about my s@@ ani@@ ty ."
"I was con@@ stan@@ tly tel@@ ling stories at home , which was good , ex@@ cept I told this to imag@@ in@@ ary friends around me , which was not so good ."
"I was an in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted child , to the point of communi@@ c@@ ating with co@@ lo@@ red c@@ ra@@ y@@ ons and apo@@ logi@@ z@@ ing to obje@@ cts when I bu@@ m@@ ped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my da@@ y@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day exper@@ ien@@ ces and emoti@@ ons ."
"What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terri@@ bly bor@@ ing , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened ."
And th@@ us began my li@@ fe@@ -@@ long pas@@ sion for writing fi@@ ction .
"So from the very beginning , fi@@ ction for me was less of an au@@ t@@ ob@@ i@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal m@@ ani@@ fe@@ st@@ ation than a tran@@ scen@@ d@@ ent@@ al jour@@ ney into other lives , other possi@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies ."
And ple@@ ase be@@ ar with me : I &apos;ll dra@@ w a cir@@ cle and come back to this point .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at .
"So from this small , super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous , mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ clas@@ s neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od of my grand@@ mother , I was z@@ o@@ om@@ ed into this pos@@ h , inter@@ national school &#91; in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d &#93; , where I was the only T@@ ur@@ k ."
"It was here that I had my first en@@ coun@@ ter with what I call the &quot; &quot; re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative fore@@ ig@@ ner . &quot; &quot; In our clas@@ s@@ room , there were children from all n@@ ati@@ on@@ ali@@ ties , yet this di@@ versity did not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly le@@ ad to a co@@ smo@@ po@@ lit@@ an , e@@ g@@ ali@@ t@@ ari@@ an clas@@ s@@ room de@@ moc@@ rac@@ y ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , it gener@@ ated an atmo@@ sp@@ here in which each child was seen — not as an individu@@ al on his own , but as the re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative of something lar@@ ger ."
"We were like a min@@ i@@ ature United N@@ ations , which was fun , ex@@ cept wh@@ en@@ ever something neg@@ ative , with re@@ gar@@ ds to a n@@ ation or a religi@@ on , took place ."
"The child who re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted it was moc@@ ked , ri@@ di@@ cu@@ led and bu@@ l@@ lie@@ d en@@ d@@ l@@ ess@@ ly ."
"And I should know , because during the time I at@@ ten@@ ded that school , a mi@@ lit@@ ary tak@@ e@@ over happened in my country , a g@@ un@@ man of my n@@ ati@@ on@@ ality ne@@ ar@@ ly kil@@ led the P@@ op@@ e , and T@@ ur@@ key got zer@@ o poin@@ ts in &#91; the &#93; Eu@@ ro@@ vision S@@ ong Con@@ test ."
( Laughter ) I sk@@ i@@ pped school often and dre@@ am@@ ed of be@@ coming a sa@@ i@@ lor during those days .
I also had my first ta@@ ste of cul@@ tu@@ ral ster@@ e@@ oty@@ p@@ es there .
"The other children asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Mi@@ dni@@ ght E@@ x@@ pre@@ ss , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they in@@ qui@@ red how many ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes a day I smo@@ ked , because they thought all T@@ ur@@ ks were he@@ av@@ y smo@@ k@@ ers , and they wonder@@ ed at what age I would start co@@ ver@@ ing my ha@@ ir ."
"I came to learn that these were the three ma@@ in ster@@ e@@ oty@@ p@@ es about my country : poli@@ ti@@ cs , ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes and the ve@@ il ."
"A@@ f@@ ter S@@ pa@@ in , we went to Jor@@ d@@ an , G@@ er@@ many and An@@ kar@@ a again ."
"E@@ very@@ where I went , I felt like my imag@@ in@@ ation was the only su@@ it@@ case I could take with me ."
"S@@ tor@@ ies gave me a sense of cen@@ ter , contin@@ u@@ ity and co@@ her@@ ence , the three big C@@ s that I o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se l@@ ac@@ ked ."
"In my mi@@ d-@@ tw@@ ent@@ ies , I mo@@ ved to I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , the city I ad@@ ore ."
"I li@@ ved in a very vi@@ br@@ ant , di@@ verse neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od where I wro@@ te se@@ ver@@ al of my no@@ v@@ els ."
I was in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l when the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake h@@ it in 199@@ 9 .
"When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that stop@@ ped me in my trac@@ ks ."
"There was the local gro@@ cer there — a gru@@ m@@ py , old man who didn &apos;t se@@ ll al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and didn &apos;t speak to mar@@ gin@@ als ."
He was sitting next to a trans@@ v@@ esti@@ te with a long black wi@@ g and mas@@ car@@ a ru@@ n@@ ning down her che@@ e@@ ks .
"I wat@@ ched the man open a p@@ ack of ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes with tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling h@@ ands and of@@ f@@ er one to her , and that is the image of the night of the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in my mind today — a con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative gro@@ cer and a c@@ ry@@ ing trans@@ v@@ esti@@ te smo@@ king together on the si@@ de@@ walk ."
"In the face of death and de@@ stru@@ ction , our mu@@ n@@ dane differ@@ ences ev@@ a@@ por@@ ated , and we all became one even if for a few hours ."
"But I &apos;ve always belie@@ ved that stories , too , have a si@@ mi@@ lar effe@@ ct on us ."
"I &apos;m not saying that fi@@ ction has the mag@@ ni@@ tu@@ de of an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but when we are re@@ ading a good no@@ vel , we leave our small , co@@ zy a@@ part@@ ments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and per@@ haps had even been bi@@ as@@ ed against ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , I went to a women &apos;s colle@@ ge in B@@ ost@@ on , then Mi@@ chi@@ g@@ an ."
"I exper@@ ien@@ ced this , not so much as a ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal shi@@ ft , as a lin@@ gu@@ i@@ stic one ."
I started writing fi@@ ction in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh .
"I &apos;m not an im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e or ex@@ ile — they ask me why I do this — but the com@@ mu@@ te between langu@@ ages gi@@ ves me the ch@@ ance to re@@ create myself ."
"I love writing in T@@ ur@@ k@@ is@@ h , which to me is very po@@ e@@ tic and very emoti@@ onal , and I love writing in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , which to me is very ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal and cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l ."
So I feel conne@@ cted to each language in a different way .
"For me , like mi@@ llions of other people around the world today , En@@ g@@ li@@ sh is an ac@@ qui@@ red language ."
"When you &apos;re a lat@@ e@@ com@@ er to a language , what happens is you live there with a contin@@ u@@ ous and per@@ pe@@ tu@@ al f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation ."
"As lat@@ e@@ com@@ ers , we always want to say more , you know , c@@ rac@@ k better jo@@ k@@ es , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a ga@@ p between the mind and the ton@@ gu@@ e ."
And that ga@@ p is very in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ating .
"But if we man@@ age not to be f@@ ri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed by it , it &apos;s also sti@@ mu@@ lat@@ ing ."
And this is what I disco@@ vered in B@@ ost@@ on — that f@@ ru@@ str@@ ation was very sti@@ mu@@ lat@@ ing .
"A@@ t this st@@ age , my grand@@ mother , who had been wat@@ ching the course of my life with incre@@ as@@ ing an@@ x@@ ie@@ ty , started to inclu@@ de in her da@@ i@@ ly pra@@ y@@ ers that I ur@@ g@@ ently get mar@@ ried so that I could se@@ t@@ tle down once and for all ."
"And because God lo@@ ves her , I did get mar@@ ried ."
"( Laughter ) But instead of se@@ t@@ t@@ ling down , I went to A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona ."
"And since my h@@ us@@ b@@ and is in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , I started com@@ mu@@ ting between A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona and I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l — the two places on the surface of ear@@ th that couldn &apos;t be more different ."
"I gu@@ ess one part of me has always been a n@@ om@@ ad , physi@@ cally and spi@@ ri@@ tually ."
"S@@ tor@@ ies ac@@ company me , ke@@ e@@ ping my pie@@ ces and memor@@ ies together , like an ex@@ ist@@ enti@@ al g@@ lu@@ e ."
"@@ Y@@ et as much as I love stories , re@@ cent@@ ly , I &apos;ve also be@@ gu@@ n to think that they lo@@ se their mag@@ ic if and when a story is seen as more than a story ."
And this is a sub@@ je@@ ct that I would love to think about together .
"When my first no@@ vel wri@@ t@@ ten in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh came out in America , I heard an interesting re@@ mar@@ k from a liter@@ ary cri@@ tic ."
"&quot; I li@@ ked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wi@@ sh you had wri@@ t@@ ten it differ@@ ently . &quot;"
( Laughter ) I asked him what he me@@ ant by that .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many S@@ p@@ ani@@ sh , American , Hi@@ sp@@ ani@@ c char@@ ac@@ ters in it , but there &apos;s only one T@@ ur@@ k@@ is@@ h char@@ ac@@ ter and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the no@@ vel took place on a uni@@ versity cam@@ pu@@ s in B@@ ost@@ on , so to me , it was nor@@ mal that there be more inter@@ national char@@ ac@@ ters in it than T@@ ur@@ k@@ is@@ h char@@ ac@@ ters , but I under@@ sto@@ od what my cri@@ tic was looking for ."
And I also under@@ sto@@ od that I would keep disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting him .
He wanted to see the m@@ ani@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of my iden@@ ti@@ ty .
He was looking for a T@@ ur@@ k@@ is@@ h woman in the book because I happened to be one .
"We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of iden@@ ti@@ ty poli@@ ti@@ cs af@@ fe@@ cts the way stories are being cir@@ cu@@ lated , read and re@@ vie@@ w@@ ed ."
"M@@ any au@@ th@@ ors feel this pres@@ sure , but n@@ on-@@ W@@ est@@ er@@ n au@@ th@@ ors feel it more he@@ avi@@ ly ."
"If you &apos;re a woman wri@@ ter from the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , like me , then you are expe@@ cted to write the stories of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women and , pre@@ fer@@ ably , the un@@ happy stories of un@@ happy M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"You &apos;re expe@@ cted to write inform@@ ative , po@@ ig@@ n@@ ant and char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ stic stories and leave the experim@@ ent@@ al and av@@ an@@ t-@@ gar@@ de to your W@@ est@@ er@@ n colle@@ ag@@ u@@ es ."
What I exper@@ ien@@ ced as a child in that school in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d is happening in the liter@@ ary world today .
"W@@ ri@@ ters are not seen as cre@@ ative individu@@ als on their own , but as the re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ati@@ ves of their re@@ spe@@ ctive cul@@ tu@@ res : a few au@@ th@@ ors from China , a few from T@@ ur@@ key , a few from Nigeri@@ a ."
"We &apos;re all thought to have something very di@@ st@@ in@@ ctive , if not pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ."
The wri@@ ter and com@@ mu@@ ter J@@ am@@ es B@@ al@@ d@@ wi@@ n gave an inter@@ view in 19@@ 8@@ 4 in which he was re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly asked about his hom@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ ality .
"When the inter@@ vie@@ wer tr@@ ied to pi@@ ge@@ on@@ ho@@ le him as a g@@ ay wri@@ ter , B@@ al@@ d@@ wi@@ n stop@@ ped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When iden@@ ti@@ ty poli@@ ti@@ cs tries to put la@@ be@@ ls on us , it is our fre@@ e@@ dom of imag@@ in@@ ation that is in d@@ ang@@ er ."
There &apos;s a fu@@ z@@ zy c@@ ate@@ g@@ ory called mul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral liter@@ ature in which all au@@ th@@ ors from outside the W@@ est@@ er@@ n world are lu@@ m@@ ped together .
"I never for@@ get my first mul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral re@@ ading , in H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard S@@ qu@@ are about 10 years ago ."
"We were three wri@@ ters , one from the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines , one T@@ ur@@ k@@ is@@ h and one In@@ d@@ one@@ si@@ an — like a jo@@ ke , you know ."
( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we sh@@ ared an arti@@ stic sty@@ le or a liter@@ ary ta@@ ste .
It was only because of our pas@@ spor@@ ts .
"M@@ ul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tu@@ ral wri@@ ters are expe@@ cted to tell real stories , not so much the imag@@ in@@ ary ."
A fun@@ ction is at@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted to fi@@ ction .
"In this way , not only the wri@@ ters themselves , but also their fi@@ cti@@ onal char@@ ac@@ ters become the re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ati@@ ves of something lar@@ ger ."
But I must quickly ad@@ d that this ten@@ den@@ cy to see a story as more than a story does not so@@ le@@ ly come from the W@@ est .
It comes from every@@ where .
And I exper@@ ien@@ ced this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and when I was put on tri@@ al in 200@@ 5 for the words my fi@@ cti@@ onal char@@ ac@@ ters ut@@ ter@@ ed in a no@@ vel .
"I had inten@@ ded to write a con@@ stru@@ ctive , mul@@ ti@@ -@@ la@@ y@@ er@@ ed no@@ vel about an Ar@@ m@@ eni@@ an and a T@@ ur@@ k@@ is@@ h family through the eyes of women ."
My mi@@ c@@ r@@ o story became a m@@ ac@@ r@@ o issue when I was pro@@ secu@@ ted .
"S@@ ome people cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed , others pra@@ is@@ ed me for writing about the T@@ ur@@ ki@@ sh@@ -@@ Ar@@ m@@ eni@@ an con@@ fli@@ ct ."
But there were times when I wanted to re@@ mind both si@@ des that this was fi@@ ction .
It was just a story .
"And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to be@@ little my work ."
"I want to love and ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate fi@@ ction for what it is , not as a means to an end ."
"W@@ ri@@ ters are enti@@ t@@ led to their poli@@ tical op@@ ini@@ ons , and there are good poli@@ tical no@@ v@@ els out there , but the language of fi@@ ction is not the language of da@@ i@@ ly poli@@ ti@@ cs ."
"Ch@@ ek@@ ho@@ v said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the cor@@ re@@ ct way of pos@@ ing the question are two completely se@@ par@@ ate things ."
And only the lat@@ ter is an arti@@ st &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility . &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ ti@@ ty poli@@ ti@@ cs di@@ vi@@ des us . F@@ i@@ ction conne@@ cts .
One is interested in s@@ wee@@ ping gener@@ aliz@@ ations .
"The other , in nu@@ an@@ ces ."
One d@@ raw@@ s b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies .
The other re@@ cogni@@ z@@ es no fron@@ t@@ ier@@ s .
I@@ den@@ ti@@ ty poli@@ ti@@ cs is made of so@@ li@@ d bri@@ cks .
F@@ i@@ ction is f@@ low@@ ing water .
"In the O@@ t@@ tom@@ an times , there were it@@ in@@ er@@ ant stor@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ ers called &quot; &quot; me@@ d@@ da@@ h . &quot; &quot; They would go to co@@ f@@ fe@@ e h@@ ous@@ es , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often impro@@ vi@@ sing ."
"Wi@@ th each new person in the story , the me@@ d@@ da@@ h would change his vo@@ ice , im@@ per@@ son@@ ating that char@@ ac@@ ter ."
"E@@ very@@ body could go and list@@ en , you know — ordin@@ ary people , even the sul@@ t@@ an , M@@ us@@ li@@ ms and n@@ on-@@ M@@ us@@ li@@ ms ."
"S@@ tor@@ ies cut across all b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies , like &quot; &quot; The T@@ al@@ es of N@@ as@@ re@@ dd@@ in H@@ od@@ ja , &quot; &quot; which were very popul@@ ar throu@@ gh@@ out the Mi@@ ddle E@@ ast , Nor@@ th Africa , the B@@ al@@ k@@ ans and A@@ si@@ a ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , stories contin@@ ue to tran@@ sc@@ end bor@@ ders ."
"When P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ an and Is@@ ra@@ e@@ li poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans talk , they usu@@ ally don &apos;t list@@ en to each other , but a P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ an re@@ a@@ der still re@@ ads a no@@ vel by a Je@@ wi@@ sh au@@ th@@ or , and vice ver@@ sa , conne@@ cting and em@@ pa@@ thi@@ z@@ ing with the nar@@ rat@@ or ."
Li@@ ter@@ ature has to take us be@@ y@@ ond .
"If it cannot take us there , it is not good liter@@ ature ."
"B@@ o@@ o@@ ks have sa@@ ved the in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted , ti@@ mi@@ d child that I was — that I once was ."
But I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the d@@ ang@@ er of fe@@ ti@@ shi@@ z@@ ing them .
"When the po@@ et and m@@ yst@@ ic , R@@ u@@ mi , met his spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al comp@@ ani@@ on , S@@ ha@@ ms of T@@ ab@@ ri@@ z , one of the first things the lat@@ ter did was to to@@ ss R@@ u@@ mi &apos;s boo@@ ks into water and wat@@ ch the let@@ ters dis@@ sol@@ ve ."
"The Su@@ f@@ is say , &quot; &quot; K@@ now@@ le@@ dge that takes you not be@@ y@@ ond yourself is far wor@@ se than ig@@ nor@@ ance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cul@@ tu@@ ral gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is not l@@ ack of know@@ le@@ dge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but know@@ le@@ dge that takes us not be@@ y@@ ond ourselves : it makes us e@@ li@@ ti@@ st , di@@ st@@ ant and dis@@ conne@@ cted ."
There &apos;s a me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or which I love : living like a d@@ raw@@ ing comp@@ as@@ s .
"As you know , one le@@ g of the comp@@ as@@ s is st@@ atic , ro@@ ot@@ ed in a place ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the other le@@ g d@@ raw@@ s a wi@@ de cir@@ cle , con@@ stan@@ tly moving ."
"L@@ i@@ ke that , my fi@@ ction as well ."
"One part of it is ro@@ ot@@ ed in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , with stron@@ g T@@ ur@@ k@@ is@@ h ro@@ ots , but the other part tra@@ v@@ els the world , conne@@ cting to different cul@@ tu@@ res ."
"In that sense , I like to think of my fi@@ ction as both local and uni@@ vers@@ al , both from here and every@@ where ."
"Now those of you who have been to I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l have probably seen T@@ op@@ ka@@ p@@ i P@@ al@@ ace , which was the resi@@ dence of O@@ t@@ tom@@ an sul@@ t@@ ans for more than 4@@ 00 years ."
"In the pal@@ ace , just outside the qu@@ ar@@ ters of the fa@@ v@@ ori@@ te con@@ cu@@ bin@@ es , there &apos;s an area called The G@@ a@@ ther@@ ing P@@ l@@ ace of the D@@ j@@ in@@ n ."
It &apos;s between buil@@ dings .
I &apos;m in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by this con@@ cept .
We usu@@ ally di@@ str@@ ust those are@@ as that f@@ all in between things .
"We see them as the dom@@ a@@ in of super@@ natural cre@@ at@@ ures like the d@@ j@@ in@@ n , who are made of smo@@ k@@ el@@ ess fi@@ re and are the sym@@ bo@@ l of e@@ lu@@ si@@ ven@@ ess ."
But my point is per@@ haps that e@@ lu@@ sive space is what wri@@ ters and arti@@ sts need most .
When I write fi@@ ction I ch@@ eri@@ sh e@@ lu@@ si@@ ven@@ ess and chang@@ e@@ ability .
I like not know@@ ing what will happen 10 p@@ ages later .
I like it when my char@@ ac@@ ters sur@@ pri@@ se me .
"I might write about a M@@ us@@ li@@ m woman in one no@@ vel , and per@@ haps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a hand@@ some , g@@ ay prof@@ ess@@ or in Nor@@ way ."
"As long as it comes from our hear@@ ts , we can write about anything and everything ."
"A@@ ud@@ re L@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; &quot; The white fa@@ thers t@@ au@@ ght us to say , &apos; I think , ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed , &quot; &quot; I feel , ther@@ e@@ fore I am f@@ ree . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful par@@ ad@@ ig@@ m shi@@ ft ."
"And yet , why is it that , in cre@@ ative writing cour@@ ses today , the very first thing we te@@ ach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?"
P@@ er@@ haps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
I@@ mag@@ in@@ ative liter@@ ature is not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly about writing who we are or what we know or what our iden@@ ti@@ ty is about .
We should te@@ ach young people and ourselves to ex@@ p@@ and our hear@@ ts and write what we can feel .
We should get out of our cul@@ tu@@ ral gh@@ et@@ to and go visi@@ t the next one and the next .
"In the end , stories move like wh@@ ir@@ ling der@@ vi@@ sh@@ es , d@@ raw@@ ing cir@@ cles be@@ y@@ ond cir@@ cles ."
"They conne@@ ct all hum@@ ani@@ ty , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of iden@@ ti@@ ty poli@@ ti@@ cs , and that is the good news ."
"And I would like to fin@@ is@@ h with an old Su@@ f@@ i po@@ em : &quot; &quot; C@@ ome , let us be friends for once ; let us make life e@@ asy on us ; let us be lo@@ ver@@ s and lo@@ ved ones ; the ear@@ th sh@@ all be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m J@@ ane M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a g@@ ame desig@@ ner .
We do ach@@ ie@@ ve more in g@@ ame wor@@ l@@ ds .
"So , so far , colle@@ cti@@ vely all the World of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al problems of A@@ zer@@ ot@@ h ."
"Now , that &apos;s not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly a bad thing ."
We &apos;re ev@@ ol@@ ving to be a more col@@ labor@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
And we actually build stron@@ ger social relation@@ ships as a resul@@ t .
F@@ i@@ ve million people use it every mon@@ th .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to sol@@ ve .
H@@ is work is bri@@ lli@@ ant .
"But it is not , by any means , an op@@ ti@@ mal situ@@ ation ."
We have to start making the real world work more like a g@@ ame .
"Be@@ fore we had aw@@ es@@ ome g@@ ame contro@@ ll@@ ers , we had sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les ."
Pe@@ ople were su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing . Pe@@ ople were fi@@ gh@@ ting .
This is really exci@@ ting .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al di@@ ce g@@ ame ."
"We want to imagine epi@@ c win@@ s , and then give people the means to ach@@ ie@@ ve the epi@@ c wi@@ n ."
We made this g@@ ame in 200@@ 7 .
This is an amazing story and ad@@ ven@@ ture for you to go on .
"We &apos;ve got a gra@@ phi@@ c no@@ vel , we &apos;ve got le@@ v@@ el@@ ing up in sk@@ il@@ ls like local in@@ si@@ ght , know@@ le@@ dge net@@ working , susta@@ in@@ ability , vision and re@@ sour@@ ce@@ fu@@ l@@ ness ."
"The &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; cre@@ w and I were called to a little tow@@ n in Col@@ or@@ a@@ do , called C@@ ra@@ i@@ g ."
It &apos;s only a couple do@@ z@@ en squ@@ are miles . It &apos;s in the R@@ oc@@ kie@@ s .
And the job in question was sh@@ e@@ ep ran@@ ch@@ er .
"My ro@@ le on the show , for those of you who ha@@ ven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple ."
"I &apos;m an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce , and I work with the people who actually do the j@@ ob@@ s in question ."
"And my respon@@ si@@ bi@@ lit@@ ies are to simply try and keep up and give an hon@@ est ac@@ coun@@ t of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life ."
The job in question : her@@ ding sh@@ e@@ ep . Gre@@ at .
We go to C@@ ra@@ i@@ g and we che@@ ck in to a hot@@ el and I realize the next day that ca@@ str@@ ation is going to be an absolu@@ te part of this work .
"So , nor@@ m@@ ally , I never do any research at all ."
"But , this is a tou@@ chy sub@@ je@@ ct , and I work for the D@@ is@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l , and we want to por@@ tra@@ y ac@@ cur@@ ately whatever it is we do , and we cer@@ tain@@ ly want to do it with a lot of re@@ spe@@ ct for the animals ."
"So I called the H@@ um@@ ane S@@ o@@ cie@@ ty and I say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , I &apos;m going to be ca@@ str@@ ating some l@@ am@@ b@@ s , C@@ an you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward . &quot; &quot; They use a b@@ and — basically a ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and , like this , only a little s@@ mal@@ ler ."
"This one was actually around the playing car@@ ds I got y@@ est@@ er@@ day , but it had a certain fami@@ li@@ ari@@ ty to it ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The b@@ and is ap@@ pl@@ ied to the ta@@ il , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
"And then another b@@ and is ap@@ pl@@ ied to the sc@@ ro@@ tu@@ m , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
B@@ lo@@ od f@@ low is s@@ low@@ ly re@@ tar@@ ded ; a week later the par@@ ts in question f@@ all off .
&quot; Gre@@ at — got it . &quot;
"O@@ K , I call the S@@ P@@ CA to con@@ fir@@ m this — they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"I also call P@@ E@@ T@@ A , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it — but they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"O@@ K , that &apos;s basically how you do it ."
So the next day I go out .
"And I &apos;m given a hor@@ se and we go get the l@@ am@@ b@@ s and we take them to a p@@ en that we built , and we go about the business of ani@@ mal h@@ us@@ b@@ and@@ ry ."
M@@ el@@ an@@ ie is the wi@@ fe of Al@@ ber@@ t .
Al@@ ber@@ t is the sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ d in question .
"M@@ el@@ an@@ ie pi@@ cks up the l@@ am@@ b — two h@@ ands — one hand on both le@@ gs on the right , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se on the left ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the pos@@ t , she open@@ s it up ."
Al@@ right . Gre@@ at .
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t goes in , I fol@@ low Al@@ ber@@ t , the cre@@ w is around ."
I always wat@@ ch the process done the first time before I try it .
"Be@@ ing an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce , you know , you do that ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t re@@ ach@@ es in his po@@ ck@@ et to pu@@ ll out , you know , this black ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and but what comes out instead is a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not ru@@ b@@ ber at all , you know ."
"And he kind of f@@ lic@@ ked it open in a way that ca@@ u@@ ght the su@@ n that was just coming over the R@@ oc@@ kie@@ s , it was very — it was , it was im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"In the space of about two secon@@ ds , Al@@ ber@@ t had the k@@ ni@@ fe between the car@@ ti@@ l@@ age of the ta@@ il , right next to the bu@@ t@@ t of the l@@ am@@ b , and very quickly the ta@@ il was gone and in the bu@@ ck@@ et that I was hol@@ ding ."
"A second later , with a big th@@ um@@ b and a well cal@@ l@@ ous@@ ed fore@@ fin@@ ger , he had the sc@@ ro@@ tu@@ m fir@@ m@@ ly in his gra@@ s@@ p ."
"And he pul@@ led it tow@@ ard him , like so , and he took the k@@ ni@@ fe and he put it on the ti@@ p ."
"Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , Mi@@ cha@@ el — you don &apos;t , OK ?"
"He s@@ ni@@ ps it , th@@ row@@ s the ti@@ p over his sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and then gra@@ b@@ s the sc@@ ro@@ tu@@ m and p@@ us@@ h@@ es it up@@ ward , and then his head di@@ ps down , ob@@ s@@ cur@@ ing my view , but what I hear is a s@@ lu@@ r@@ ping sound , and a no@@ ise that sounds like V@@ el@@ c@@ r@@ o being y@@ an@@ ked off a sti@@ ck@@ y w@@ all and I am not even ki@@ d@@ ding ."
C@@ an we ro@@ ll the video ?
No I &apos;m ki@@ d@@ ding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pi@@ ctures .
"So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; sho@@ ot , ever ."
"I say , &quot; &quot; Ti@@ me out . S@@ top . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two ."
"There &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ting , there &apos;s no n@@ on@@ sense ."
"We don &apos;t fo@@ ol around , we don &apos;t re@@ hear@@ se — we sho@@ ot what we get !"
"I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ top . This is nu@@ ts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know ."
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is c@@ razy .
"We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Al@@ ber@@ t &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are te@@ sti@@ cles in this bu@@ ck@@ et and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him expla@@ in , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ ands . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Li@@ ke the H@@ um@@ ane S@@ o@@ cie@@ ty ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the H@@ um@@ ane S@@ o@@ cie@@ ty ."
"L@@ et &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the l@@ am@@ b squ@@ e@@ al and b@@ le@@ ed — we &apos;re on in five contin@@ ents , du@@ de ."
"We &apos;re on t@@ wi@@ ce a day on the D@@ is@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he pul@@ ls out a ba@@ g of these little ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ ands ."
"M@@ el@@ an@@ ie pi@@ cks up another l@@ am@@ b , pu@@ ts it on the pos@@ t , b@@ and goes on the ta@@ il , b@@ and goes on the sc@@ ro@@ tu@@ m ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the ground , l@@ am@@ b takes two ste@@ ps , fal@@ ls down , gets up , sha@@ k@@ es a little , takes another couple ste@@ ps , fal@@ ls down ."
"I &apos;m like , this is not a good sig@@ n for this l@@ am@@ b , at all ."
"G@@ ets up , wal@@ ks to the cor@@ ner , it &apos;s qui@@ ver@@ ing , and it l@@ ies down and it &apos;s in obvi@@ ous di@@ stre@@ ss ."

"When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to f@@ all off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;"

"( Laughter ) And I was es@@ pe@@ cially re@@ min@@ ded of what an ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ously shor@@ t stra@@ w I had that day because now I had to do what Al@@ ber@@ t had just done , and there are like 100 of these l@@ am@@ b@@ s in the p@@ en , and sud@@ den@@ ly this whole thing &apos;s star@@ ting to feel like a G@@ er@@ man por@@ no , and I &apos;m like ...

"( Laughter ) Li@@ ke , how did — how did I get here ?"
How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those mom@@ ents where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and sud@@ den@@ ly , I &apos;m standing there , in the R@@ oc@@ kie@@ s , and all I can think of is the A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ e@@ li@@ an defini@@ tion of a tra@@ ge@@ dy ."

I went in and I took them .
"I took them like this , and I y@@ an@@ ked my face back ."
And I &apos;m standing there with two te@@ sti@@ cles on my ch@@ in .
( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t sha@@ ke the me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or .
"O@@ K , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; Po@@ e@@ ti@@ cs , &quot; &quot; in A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le , and I &apos;m thinking — out of now@@ here , two terms come c@@ ra@@ sh@@ ing into my head that I ha@@ ven &apos;t heard since my clas@@ si@@ cs prof@@ ess@@ or in colle@@ ge dri@@ l@@ led them there ."
And they are an@@ ag@@ n@@ ori@@ sis and per@@ i@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
A@@ na@@ gn@@ ori@@ sis and per@@ i@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
A@@ na@@ gn@@ ori@@ sis is the Gre@@ ek word for disco@@ very .
"L@@ i@@ ter@@ ally , the tran@@ si@@ tion from ig@@ nor@@ ance to know@@ le@@ dge is an@@ ag@@ n@@ ori@@ sis ."
It &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; is .
And I &apos;m up to my ne@@ ck in an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ es every single day .
Gre@@ at .
"The other word , per@@ i@@ pe@@ te@@ ia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tra@@ ge@@ d@@ ies , you know — Eu@@ ri@@ pi@@ des and S@@ op@@ ho@@ cles — the moment where O@@ e@@ di@@ pu@@ s has his moment , where he sud@@ den@@ ly realiz@@ es that ho@@ t chi@@ ck he &apos;s been sle@@ e@@ ping with and having b@@ ab@@ ies with is his mother . OK ."
That &apos;s per@@ i@@ pe@@ ty or per@@ i@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
And this me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or in my head — I got an@@ ag@@ n@@ ori@@ sis and per@@ i@@ pe@@ ti@@ a on my ch@@ in .
"( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great de@@ vice though ."
"When you start to look for per@@ i@@ pe@@ ti@@ a , you find it every@@ where ."
"I mean , B@@ ru@@ ce W@@ il@@ l@@ is in &quot; &quot; The S@@ i@@ x@@ th S@@ en@@ se , &quot; &quot; right ?"
"S@@ pen@@ ds the whole movie trying to help the little kid who se@@ es de@@ ad people , and then , bo@@ om — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m de@@ ad &quot; &quot; — per@@ i@@ pe@@ ti@@ a ."
You know ?
It &apos;s c@@ rus@@ h@@ ing when the audience se@@ es it the right way .
"N@@ e@@ o in &quot; &quot; The M@@ at@@ ri@@ x , &quot; &quot; you know ?"
"&quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s we@@ ird ."
"These disco@@ ver@@ ies that le@@ ad to sud@@ den realiz@@ ations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 2@@ 00 di@@ r@@ ty j@@ ob@@ s , I have them all the time , but that one — that one dri@@ l@@ led something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t pre@@ par@@ ed for ."
"And , as I sto@@ od there , looking at the happy l@@ am@@ b that I had just de@@ fi@@ led — but it looked OK ."
"L@@ o@@ o@@ king at that po@@ or other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was stru@@ ck by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a liter@@ al way , what other per@@ i@@ pat@@ e@@ tic mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tions might I be able to com@@ ment upo@@ n ?"
"Because , look , I &apos;m not a social an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logi@@ st but I have a friend who is ."
And I talk to him .
"( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey Mi@@ ke ."
"L@@ ook , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve sh@@ ot in every state ?"
"You &apos;ve worked in min@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in fi@@ sh@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in ste@@ el , you &apos;ve worked in every major indu@@ stry ."
"You &apos;ve had your back sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der to sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der with these guys that our poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans are des@@ per@@ ate to rel@@ ate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see H@@ il@@ lar@@ y doing the sh@@ ots of ry@@ e , dri@@ b@@ b@@ ling down her ch@@ in , with the ste@@ el wor@@ k@@ ers ."
"I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day ."
"&quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thou@@ ghts , colle@@ cti@@ vely , it might be time to think about it ."
"Because , du@@ de , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , te@@ sti@@ cles are on my ch@@ in , thou@@ ghts are b@@ oun@@ cing around ."
"And , after that sho@@ ot , D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , per@@ son@@ ally ."
"And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 19@@ 0 like it ."
"I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other noti@@ ons of work that I &apos;ve just been as@@ sum@@ ing are s@@ ac@@ ro@@ s@@ an@@ ct , and they &apos;re not ."
Pe@@ ople with di@@ r@@ ty j@@ ob@@ s are ha@@ p@@ pie@@ r than you think .
"As a group , they &apos;re the ha@@ p@@ pie@@ st people I know ."
"And I don &apos;t want to start wh@@ ist@@ ling &quot; &quot; L@@ ook for the Uni@@ on L@@ a@@ be@@ l , &quot; &quot; and all that happy wor@@ k@@ er c@@ ra@@ p ."
I &apos;m just tel@@ ling you that these are bal@@ an@@ ced people who do un@@ thin@@ k@@ able work .
Ro@@ ad@@ ki@@ ll pi@@ ck@@ er@@ -@@ up@@ per@@ s wh@@ ist@@ le while they work . I s@@ we@@ ar to God — I did it with them .
They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of sym@@ me@@ try to their life .
And I see it over and over and over again .
So I started to won@@ der what would happen if we challen@@ g@@ ed some of these s@@ ac@@ red c@@ ow@@ s .
F@@ ol@@ low your pas@@ sion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 3@@ 6 hours .
F@@ ol@@ low your pas@@ sion — what could possi@@ bly be wrong with that ?
P@@ rob@@ ably the wor@@ st ad@@ vice I ever got .
"( Laughter ) You know , fol@@ low your dre@@ am@@ s and go bro@@ ke , right ?"
"I mean , that &apos;s all I heard grow@@ ing up ."
"I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you fol@@ low your pas@@ sion , it &apos;s going to work out ."
"I can give you 30 exam@@ ples , right now — Bo@@ b C@@ om@@ b@@ s , the pi@@ g farm@@ er in L@@ as V@@ e@@ gas who colle@@ cts the u@@ ne@@ at@@ en sc@@ ra@@ ps of food from the c@@ as@@ in@@ os and fe@@ eds them them to his s@@ w@@ ine ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because there &apos;s so much prote@@ in in the stuff we don &apos;t e@@ at his pi@@ gs gro@@ w at t@@ wi@@ ce the nor@@ mal speed , and he is one ri@@ ch pi@@ g farm@@ er , and he is good for the environment , and he sp@@ en@@ ds his days doing this incredible ser@@ vice , and he s@@ me@@ l@@ ls like he@@ ll , but God bl@@ ess him ."
He &apos;s making a great living .
"You ask him , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you fol@@ low your pas@@ sion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d l@@ au@@ gh at you ."
"The guy &apos;s wor@@ th — he just got of@@ fer@@ ed like 60 million dollars for his far@@ m and turned it down , outside of V@@ e@@ gas ."
He didn &apos;t fol@@ low his pas@@ sion .
He ste@@ pped back and he wat@@ ched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
And I hear that story over and over .
"M@@ at@@ t F@@ ro@@ ind , a da@@ i@@ ry farm@@ er in New C@@ an@@ a@@ an , Con@@ ne@@ cti@@ cut , who wo@@ ke up one day and realized the c@@ ra@@ p from his c@@ ow@@ s was wor@@ th more than their mi@@ l@@ k , if he could use it to make these bio@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able f@@ low@@ er po@@ ts ."
"Now , he &apos;s sel@@ ling them to W@@ al@@ mar@@ t ."
F@@ ol@@ low his pas@@ sion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
"So I started to look at pas@@ sion , I started to look at ef@@ fi@@ cien@@ cy ver@@ su@@ s effe@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess — as T@@ im tal@@ ked about ear@@ lie@@ r , that &apos;s a huge di@@ st@@ in@@ ction ."
"I started to look at te@@ am@@ work and de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation , and basically all those pl@@ ati@@ tu@@ des they call &quot; &quot; suc@@ ces@@ sor@@ ies &quot; &quot; that h@@ an@@ g with that sch@@ mal@@ t@@ zy art in bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ oms around the world right now ."
That stuff — it &apos;s sud@@ den@@ ly all been turned on its head .
S@@ a@@ fe@@ ty — sa@@ fe@@ ty first ?
"G@@ o@@ ing back to , you know , O@@ S@@ H@@ A and P@@ E@@ T@@ A and the H@@ um@@ ane S@@ o@@ cie@@ ty : what if O@@ S@@ H@@ A got it wrong ?"
"I mean — this is her@@ es@@ y , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really sa@@ fe@@ ty third ?"
R@@ ight ?
"( Laughter ) No , I mean really ."
"What I mean to say is I val@@ ue my sa@@ fe@@ ty on these c@@ razy j@@ ob@@ s as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about sa@@ fe@@ ty first ."
"They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done ."
"And I &apos;ll never for@@ get , up in the B@@ ering Se@@ a , I was on a c@@ ra@@ b boat with the &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ lie@@ st C@@ at@@ ch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first se@@ as@@ on ."
"We &apos;re about 100 miles off the co@@ ast of R@@ us@@ si@@ a : 5@@ 0-@@ fo@@ ot se@@ as , big wa@@ ves , green water coming over the whe@@ el@@ house , right ?"
"Mo@@ st ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , las@@ h@@ ing the po@@ ts down ."
"So , I &apos;m 40 fe@@ et off the de@@ ck , which is like looking down at the top of your sho@@ e , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean ."
U@@ n@@ spe@@ ak@@ ably d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
"I sc@@ am@@ per down , I go into the whe@@ el@@ house and I say , with some level of incre@@ du@@ lity , &quot; C@@ ap@@ tain , O@@ S@@ H@@ A . &quot;"
"And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ S@@ H@@ A ? O@@ ce@@ an . &quot; &quot; And he poin@@ ts out there ."
"( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated in the low@@ er 4@@ 8 ."
It can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated on any fac@@ t@@ ory flo@@ or or any con@@ stru@@ ction site .
"But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ on &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he cal@@ ls me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; S@@ on , I &apos;m a cap@@ tain of a c@@ ra@@ b boat ."
My respon@@ si@@ bility is not to get you home ali@@ ve .
"My respon@@ si@@ bility is to get you home ri@@ ch . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home ali@@ ve , that &apos;s on you ."
"And for the rest of that day , sa@@ fe@@ ty first ."
"I was like — So , the idea that we create this fal@@ se — this sense of com@@ plac@@ en@@ cy when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility as though it &apos;s our own , and vice ver@@ sa ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ how , a whole lot of things ."
I could talk at len@@ g@@ th about the many little di@@ st@@ in@@ ctions we made and the en@@ d@@ less li@@ st of ways that I got it wrong .
"But , what it all comes down to is this ."
"I form@@ ed a the@@ ory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my re@@ ma@@ ining two minutes and 30 secon@@ ds ."
"It goes like this — we &apos;ve dec@@ lar@@ ed war on work , as a society , all of us ."
It &apos;s a ci@@ vi@@ l war .
"It &apos;s a c@@ old war , really ."
"We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t t@@ wi@@ st our mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he in some M@@ ac@@ hi@@ av@@ el@@ li@@ an way , but we &apos;ve done it ."
"And we &apos;ve wa@@ g@@ ed this war on at least four fron@@ ts , cer@@ tain@@ ly in H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood ."
The way we por@@ tra@@ y working people on T@@ V — it &apos;s l@@ au@@ g@@ ha@@ ble .
"If there &apos;s a p@@ lu@@ m@@ ber , he &apos;s 3@@ 00 po@@ un@@ ds and he &apos;s got a gi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ t c@@ rac@@ k . A@@ d@@ m@@ it it ."
You see him all the time .
"That &apos;s what p@@ lu@@ m@@ bers look like , right ?"
"We turn them into her@@ o@@ es , or we turn them into pun@@ ch lin@@ es ."
That &apos;s what T@@ V does .
"We try hard on &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t che@@ at ."
"But , we &apos;ve wa@@ g@@ ed this war on M@@ ad@@ is@@ on A@@ ven@@ ue ."
"I mean , so many of the comm@@ er@@ ci@@ als that come out there — in the way of a mess@@ age , what &apos;s really being said ?"
"@@ Y@@ our life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little ear@@ lie@@ r , if you could re@@ ti@@ re a little f@@ ast@@ er , if you could pun@@ ch out a little so@@ on@@ er — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again ."
W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton ? I can &apos;t even beg@@ in to talk about the de@@ als and poli@@ cies in place that af@@ fe@@ ct the bot@@ tom line re@@ ality of the available j@@ ob@@ s because I don &apos;t really know .
I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
"And right here guys , S@@ i@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ ley , I mean — how many people have an i@@ P@@ h@@ one on them right now ?"
How many people have their B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ r@@ ies ?
We &apos;re p@@ lu@@ gg@@ ed in ; we &apos;re conne@@ cted .
I would never su@@ ggest for a second that something bad has come out of the te@@ ch re@@ v@@ olution .
"G@@ o@@ od gr@@ ie@@ f , not to this c@@ row@@ d ."
( Laughter ) But I would su@@ ggest that in@@ no@@ vation without imi@@ tation is a comple@@ te wa@@ ste of time .
And no@@ body ce@@ le@@ br@@ ates imi@@ tation the way &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
"@@ Y@@ our i@@ P@@ h@@ one without those people making the same inter@@ face , the same cir@@ cu@@ i@@ try , the same bo@@ ard , over and over ?"
All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equ@@ ally as possible as the g@@ eni@@ us that goes inside of it .
"So , we &apos;ve got this new to@@ ol@@ box , you know ."
O@@ ur to@@ ols today don &apos;t look like sho@@ v@@ els and pi@@ cks .
They look like the stuff we walk around with .
And so the colle@@ ctive effe@@ ct of all of that has been this mar@@ gin@@ aliz@@ ation of lots and lots of j@@ ob@@ s .
"And I realized , probably too l@@ ate in this g@@ ame — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 2@@ 00 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can ."
"And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the te@@ sti@@ cles on my ch@@ in ."
I got a lot wrong .
"So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a P@@ R cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n for work , man@@ u@@ al lab@@ or , sk@@ il@@ led lab@@ or ."
S@@ ome@@ body needs to be out there talking about the for@@ got@@ ten b@@ ene@@ fi@@ ts .
"I &apos;m talking about grand@@ father stuff , the stuff a lot us probably gre@@ w up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little ."
Bar@@ ack wan@@ ts to create two and a half million j@@ ob@@ s .
The in@@ fra@@ structure is a huge deal .
"This war on work , that I sup@@ pos@@ e ex@@ ist@@ s , has c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ties like any other war ."
The in@@ fra@@ structure &apos;s the first one ; dec@@ lin@@ ing tra@@ de@@ -@@ school en@@ rol@@ l@@ ments are the second one .
"E@@ very single year : fe@@ wer electri@@ ci@@ ans , fe@@ wer car@@ pen@@ ters , fe@@ wer p@@ lu@@ m@@ bers , fe@@ wer wel@@ ders , fe@@ wer pi@@ pe@@ fi@@ t@@ ters , fe@@ wer ste@@ am@@ fi@@ t@@ ters ."
"The in@@ fra@@ structure j@@ ob@@ s that everybody is talking about cre@@ ating are those guys — the ones that have been in dec@@ line , over and over ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , we &apos;ve got two tri@@ llion dollars — at a min@@ i@@ mu@@ m , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the American S@@ o@@ cie@@ ty of C@@ i@@ vi@@ l En@@ gine@@ ers — that we need to ex@@ p@@ end to even make a dent in the in@@ fra@@ structure , which is cur@@ r@@ ently r@@ ated at a D min@@ us ."
"So , if I were ru@@ n@@ ning for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to make and the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to create ar@@ en &apos;t going to sti@@ ck un@@ less they &apos;re j@@ ob@@ s that people want ."
"And I know the point of this con@@ fer@@ ence is to ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate things that are ne@@ ar and de@@ ar to us , but I also know that cle@@ an and di@@ r@@ ty ar@@ en &apos;t op@@ posi@@ tes ."
"They &apos;re two si@@ des of the same co@@ in , just like in@@ no@@ vation and imi@@ tation , like ri@@ sk and respon@@ si@@ bility , like per@@ i@@ pe@@ ti@@ a and an@@ ag@@ n@@ ori@@ sis , like that po@@ or little l@@ am@@ b , who I hope isn &apos;t qui@@ ver@@ ing any@@ more , and like my time that &apos;s gone ."
"It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?"
( Applause )
"My big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lo@@ ck bi@@ llions of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ or@@ m@@ ant inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is sle@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of ty@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of sle@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved women .
"And I learned the hard way , the val@@ ue of sle@@ ep ."
"T@@ wo@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years ago , I fa@@ in@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sti@@ on ."
"I h@@ it my head on my des@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ ek@@ b@@ one , I got five sti@@ t@@ ch@@ es on my right ey@@ e ."
And I began the jour@@ ney of re@@ disco@@ ver@@ ing the val@@ ue of sle@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I stud@@ ied , I met with medi@@ cal do@@ ct@@ ors , scienti@@ sts , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produ@@ ctive , more inspi@@ red , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough sle@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new re@@ v@@ olution , this new fe@@ min@@ i@@ st issue ."
"We are liter@@ ally going to sle@@ ep our way to the top , liter@@ ally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely for men , sle@@ ep de@@ pri@@ vation has become a vi@@ ri@@ lity sym@@ bo@@ l ."
I was re@@ cent@@ ly having din@@ ner with a guy who bra@@ gg@@ ed that he had only got@@ ten four hours sle@@ ep the night before .
"And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had got@@ ten five , this din@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sle@@ ep de@@ pri@@ vation one@@ -@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re li@@ ke@@ ly to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck is too l@@ ate for me , but that &apos;s o@@ kay , I can get a g@@ ame of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence cal@@ ls and me@@ et you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly bus@@ y and produ@@ ctive , but the tru@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had bri@@ lli@@ ant le@@ ad@@ ers in business , in fin@@ ance , in poli@@ ti@@ cs , making terri@@ ble deci@@ sions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good lea@@ der , because the essen@@ ce of le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship is being able to see the i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g before it hi@@ ts the T@@ it@@ ani@@ c ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many i@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs hi@@ tting our T@@ it@@ ani@@ cs .
"In fact , I have a feeling that if Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ ist@@ ers , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) W@@ hi@@ le all the bro@@ thers were bus@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ conne@@ cted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a si@@ ster would have noti@@ ced the i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g , because she would have wok@@ en up from a se@@ ven@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or e@@ igh@@ t-@@ hour sle@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the mul@@ ti@@ ple cri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a per@@ s@@ onal level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , gr@@ ati@@ tu@@ de , effe@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own car@@ e@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ u@@ t your eyes and disco@@ ver the great ideas that lie inside us , to sh@@ u@@ t your en@@ gin@@ es and disco@@ ver the power of sle@@ ep ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Well , as Ch@@ ris poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the fun@@ ctions and structure of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a minu@@ te about what this ent@@ ail@@ s .
"H@@ ere is this mas@@ s of je@@ lly , thre@@ e-@@ po@@ u@@ nd mas@@ s of je@@ lly you can h@@ old in the pal@@ m of your hand , and it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ lar space ."
It can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fini@@ ty and it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate itself con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating on the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fini@@ ty .
"And this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar re@@ cur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the ho@@ ly gra@@ il of neuro@@ science , of neuro@@ logy , and hop@@ e@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this m@@ yst@@ eri@@ ous or@@ g@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little wi@@ sp@@ s of pro@@ top@@ las@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this acti@@ vity em@@ er@@ ges the whole spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of abi@@ lit@@ ies that we call human nature and human con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the fun@@ ctions of the human brain ."
"One appro@@ ach , the one we use ma@@ in@@ ly , is to look at patients with susta@@ ined dam@@ age to a small regi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gen@@ e@@ tic change in a small regi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard redu@@ ction in all your ment@@ al ca@@ pac@@ it@@ ies , a sort of blu@@ n@@ ting of your cogni@@ tive ability ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly se@@ le@@ ctive lo@@ ss of one fun@@ ction , with other fun@@ ctions being pre@@ ser@@ ved in@@ t@@ act , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ dence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how inv@@ olved in medi@@ ating that fun@@ ction ."
"So you can then ma@@ p fun@@ ction on@@ to structure , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ i@@ try &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular fun@@ ction ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king exam@@ ples of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m gi@@ ving you three exam@@ ples , six minutes each , during this talk ."
The first example is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ me called C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s syn@@ dro@@ me .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be@@ s , fron@@ tal lo@@ be@@ s , par@@ ie@@ tal lo@@ be@@ s , OK — the lo@@ be@@ s that con@@ stitu@@ te the brain ."
"And if you look , tu@@ cked away inside the in@@ ner surface of the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be@@ s — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s dam@@ aged , you can no longer re@@ cogni@@ ze people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still re@@ cogni@@ ze them from their vo@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even re@@ cogni@@ ze yourself in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you win@@ k and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really re@@ cogni@@ ze yourself as yourself ."
OK . Now that syn@@ dro@@ me is well known as ca@@ used by dam@@ age to the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are syn@@ dro@@ me , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few physi@@ ci@@ ans have heard about it , not even neuro@@ logi@@ sts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s de@@ lu@@ sion , and that is a patien@@ t , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ mal , has had a head in@@ j@@ ury , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ mal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ post@@ or ."
"S@@ he &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is perfe@@ ct@@ ly lu@@ ci@@ d and inte@@ lli@@ g@@ ent in all other re@@ spe@@ cts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his de@@ lu@@ sion ki@@ cks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pret@@ ation of this , which you find in all the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry te@@ x@@ t@@ boo@@ ks , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent ap@@ pl@@ ies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys ."
"When you &apos;re a little b@@ aby , a young b@@ aby , you had a stron@@ g se@@ x@@ u@@ al at@@ trac@@ tion to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ pu@@ s comple@@ x of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the stan@@ d@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you gro@@ w up , the cor@@ te@@ x develo@@ ps , and in@@ hi@@ bi@@ ts these lat@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges towar@@ ds your mother ."
"Th@@ ank God , or you would all be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally aro@@ used when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , dam@@ ag@@ ing the cor@@ te@@ x , allow@@ ing these lat@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to em@@ er@@ ge , fl@@ am@@ ing to the surface , and sud@@ den@@ ly and in@@ ex@@ p@@ lic@@ ably you find yourself being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally aro@@ used by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ post@@ or . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pret@@ ation that makes sense to your dam@@ aged brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent ."
"It &apos;s very ing@@ eni@@ ous , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same de@@ lu@@ sion , a patien@@ t having the same de@@ lu@@ sion , about his pe@@ t po@@ od@@ le . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ ctor , this is not F@@ i@@ f@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ i@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the lat@@ ent be@@ sti@@ ality in all hum@@ ans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to expla@@ in this cu@@ ri@@ ous di@@ sor@@ der , we look at the structure and fun@@ ctions of the nor@@ mal vi@@ su@@ al pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , vi@@ su@@ al sig@@ n@@ als come in , into the e@@ ye@@ bal@@ ls , go to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vision , and after pro@@ cess@@ ing all that , the mess@@ age goes to a small structure called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s , where you per@@ cei@@ ve fac@@ es ."
There are neuron@@ s there that are sen@@ si@@ tive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ lie@@ r .
"Now , when that area &apos;s dam@@ aged , you lo@@ se the ability to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that area , the mess@@ age c@@ as@@ ca@@ des into a structure called the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emoti@@ onal cor@@ e of the brain , and that structure , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a , g@@ au@@ ges the emoti@@ onal sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
Is it pre@@ y ? Is it pre@@ d@@ ator ? Is it m@@ ate ?
"O@@ r is it something absolu@@ tely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of lin@@ t , or a piece of chal@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? OK ?"
Wh@@ ich you can completely ig@@ nor@@ e .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a is exci@@ ted , and this is something important , the mess@@ ages then c@@ as@@ c@@ ade into the au@@ ton@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating f@@ ast@@ er .
You start s@@ we@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cular ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ tu@@ n@@ ate , because we can put two ele@@ c@@ tro@@ des on your pal@@ m and meas@@ ure the change in sk@@ in resi@@ stance produ@@ ced by s@@ we@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exci@@ ted or whether you &apos;re aro@@ used , or not , OK ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minu@@ te .
"So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an obje@@ ct , when he looks at his — any obje@@ ct for that matter , it goes to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as and , h@@ ow@@ ever , and it &apos;s pro@@ cess@@ ed in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and you re@@ cogni@@ ze it as a pe@@ a pl@@ ant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?"
"And then the mess@@ age c@@ as@@ ca@@ des into the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a , and then goes down the au@@ ton@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that wi@@ re that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emoti@@ onal cor@@ e of the brain , is cut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So because the fu@@ si@@ form is in@@ t@@ act , the cha@@ p can still re@@ cogni@@ ze his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wi@@ re is cut to the emoti@@ onal cen@@ ters , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? R@@ ight ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ ex@@ p@@ lic@@ able l@@ ack of emoti@@ ons ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some str@@ ange woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a scre@@ en , and meas@@ ure your gal@@ v@@ ani@@ c sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pi@@ ctures on the scre@@ en , I can meas@@ ure how you s@@ we@@ at when you see an obje@@ ct , like a table or an um@@ b@@ rel@@ la . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t s@@ we@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a li@@ on , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start s@@ we@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about nor@@ mal people — you start s@@ we@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be Je@@ wi@@ sh .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patien@@ t ?"
You take the patien@@ t and show him pi@@ ctures on the scre@@ en and meas@@ ure his gal@@ v@@ ani@@ c sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and cha@@ ir@@ s and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in nor@@ mal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the gal@@ v@@ ani@@ c sk@@ in respon@@ se is f@@ lat ."
"There &apos;s no emoti@@ onal re@@ action to his mother , because that wi@@ re going from the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as to the emoti@@ onal cen@@ ters is cut ."
"So his vision is nor@@ mal because the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as are nor@@ mal , his emoti@@ ons are nor@@ mal — he &apos;ll l@@ au@@ gh , he &apos;ll c@@ ry , so on and so for@@ th — but the wi@@ re from vision to emoti@@ ons is cut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this de@@ lu@@ sion that his mother is an im@@ post@@ or ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ vely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bi@@ zar@@ re , seem@@ ing@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble , neu@@ ral psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c syn@@ dro@@ me and say that the stan@@ d@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a pre@@ ci@@ se ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known neu@@ ral an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this patien@@ t then goes , and mother ph@@ ones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pi@@ cks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? W@@ here are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no de@@ lu@@ sion through the phone ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an hour , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate pa@@ th@@ way going from the hear@@ ing cen@@ ters in the brain to the emoti@@ onal cen@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been cut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So this expla@@ ins why through the phone he re@@ cogni@@ z@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ post@@ or ."
"O@@ K , how is all this comple@@ x cir@@ cu@@ i@@ try set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we appro@@ ach this problem by consi@@ der@@ ing another cu@@ ri@@ ous syn@@ dro@@ me called ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated , or a le@@ g is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated , for g@@ ang@@ ren@@ e , or you lo@@ se it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a seri@@ ous problem — you contin@@ ue to vi@@ vi@@ d@@ ly feel the pre@@ sen@@ ce of that mis@@ sing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ tom le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ tom with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ el@@ ie@@ ve it or not , even with inter@@ na@@ l vi@@ sc@@ era ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the u@@ ter@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — h@@ yst@@ er@@ e@@ ct@@ om@@ y — who have a ph@@ an@@ tom u@@ ter@@ us , inclu@@ ding ph@@ an@@ tom men@@ stru@@ al c@@ ra@@ m@@ ps at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stud@@ ent asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get ph@@ an@@ tom P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ je@@ ct ri@@ pe for scienti@@ fic en@@ qui@@ ry , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s by doing experim@@ ents ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s c@@ la@@ im that they can move the ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll wa@@ ve go@@ od@@ by@@ e ."
"These are very compe@@ l@@ ling , vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ s@@ ations ."
The patien@@ t &apos;s not de@@ lu@@ si@@ onal .
"He know@@ s that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s a compe@@ l@@ ling sen@@ sor@@ y experience for the patien@@ t ."
"But h@@ ow@@ ever , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But do@@ ctor , the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a c@@ len@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s ex@@ c@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pa@@ in will be re@@ lie@@ ved . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ?"
It sounds like an o@@ x@@ y@@ mo@@ ro@@ n .
"But when we were looking at the case sh@@ e@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s , the ori@@ gin@@ al ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ zed because of the per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ j@@ ury ."
"The ac@@ tu@@ al ner@@ ve sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m was se@@ vered , was cut , by say , a mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So the patien@@ t had an ac@@ tu@@ al ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ i@@ ded at@@ tem@@ pt to get ri@@ d of the pa@@ in in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ pu@@ t@@ ates the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m with the same pa@@ ins , right ?"
And this is a seri@@ ous c@@ lini@@ cal problem .
P@@ at@@ ien@@ ts become de@@ pres@@ sed .
"S@@ ome of them are dri@@ ven to su@@ i@@ ci@@ de , OK ?"
"So , how do you tre@@ at this syn@@ dro@@ me ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case sh@@ e@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tu@@ al ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m had been cut , and the ac@@ tu@@ al ar@@ m had been par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , and l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for se@@ ver@@ al months before the am@@ pu@@ tation , and this pa@@ in then gets car@@ ried over into the ph@@ an@@ tom itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was in@@ t@@ act , but par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , the brain sen@@ ds com@@ man@@ ds to the ar@@ m , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ i@@ try of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s , OK ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ e@@ b@@ bi@@ an , as@@ so@@ ci@@ ative lin@@ k , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ s@@ ation of a par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s car@@ r@@ ies over into your body image and into your ph@@ an@@ tom , OK ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"H@@ ow do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s , so you can re@@ lie@@ ve him of this ex@@ c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating , c@@ len@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now sen@@ d the comm@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ tom , but give him vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s obe@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ a@@ ybe you can re@@ lie@@ ve the ph@@ an@@ tom pa@@ in , the ph@@ an@@ tom c@@ ra@@ m@@ p ."
"H@@ ow do you do that ? Well , vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al re@@ ality ."
But that co@@ sts mi@@ llions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fun@@ ding ag@@ en@@ cies ."
( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r box .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard box with a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r in the mi@@ ddle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ tom — so my first patien@@ t , D@@ er@@ ek , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated 10 years ago .
"He had a brac@@ hi@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were cut and the ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m , ex@@ c@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r like that , in a box , which I call a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r box , right ?"
"And the patien@@ t pu@@ ts his ph@@ an@@ tom left ar@@ m , which is c@@ len@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and the nor@@ mal hand on the right side of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same po@@ stu@@ re , the c@@ len@@ ched po@@ stu@@ re , and looks inside the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ tom being re@@ sur@@ re@@ cted , because he &apos;s looking at the ref@@ le@@ ction of the nor@@ mal ar@@ m in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ tom has been re@@ sur@@ re@@ cted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wi@@ gg@@ le your ph@@ an@@ tom — your real fin@@ g@@ ers , or move your real fin@@ g@@ ers while looking in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vi@@ su@@ al im@@ pres@@ sion that the ph@@ an@@ tom is moving , right ?"
"That &apos;s obvi@@ ous , but the ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing thing is , the patien@@ t then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ tom is moving again , and the pa@@ in , the c@@ len@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m , is re@@ lie@@ ved . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patien@@ t who came in — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) My first patien@@ t came in , and he looked in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook at your ref@@ le@@ ction of your ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ g@@ gl@@ ing , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ pi@@ d . He know@@ s it &apos;s not real ."
"He know@@ s it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r ref@@ le@@ ction , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sor@@ y experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your nor@@ mal hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ tom . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your nor@@ mal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ tom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !"
And my pa@@ in is being re@@ lie@@ ved . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ lo@@ se your eyes . &quot; &quot; He clo@@ ses his eyes ."
&quot; And move your nor@@ mal hand . &quot;
"&quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s c@@ len@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;"
"&quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a kid in a can@@ dy stor@@ e ."
"So , I said , OK , this pro@@ ves my the@@ ory about learned par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s and the cri@@ tical ro@@ le of vi@@ su@@ al in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a N@@ obe@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely us@@ el@@ ess ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started realiz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s that you see in neuro@@ logy , like stro@@ ke , fo@@ cal d@@ yst@@ oni@@ as — there may be a learned com@@ pon@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple de@@ vice of using a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , D@@ er@@ ek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ ry@@ ing a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his pa@@ in — I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , D@@ er@@ ek , take it home and prac@@ ti@@ ce with it for a week or two ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe , after a per@@ i@@ od of prac@@ ti@@ ce , you can disp@@ en@@ se with the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s , and start moving your par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ar@@ m , and then , re@@ lie@@ ve yourself of pa@@ in . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ ake it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he ph@@ ones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ ctor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r box was gone ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ tom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human sub@@ je@@ cts , e@@ thi@@ cs and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ er@@ ek , does this bo@@ ther you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ b@@ ow pa@@ in , no c@@ len@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ tom fore@@ ar@@ m pa@@ in , all those pa@@ ins are gone away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers d@@ ang@@ ling from the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and your box doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my fore@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and e@@ li@@ min@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of mag@@ i@@ ci@@ an ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sen@@ sor@@ y con@@ fli@@ ct .
It &apos;s getting mess@@ ages from vision saying the ph@@ an@@ tom is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , mus@@ cle sig@@ n@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your mot@@ or comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this con@@ fli@@ ct , the brain says , to he@@ ll with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ tom , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of d@@ eni@@ al — it g@@ ates the sig@@ n@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars , the b@@ on@@ us is , the pa@@ in disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars because you can &apos;t have dise@@ m@@ bod@@ ied pa@@ in flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the b@@ on@@ us ."
"Now , this techni@@ qu@@ e has been tr@@ ied on do@@ z@@ ens of patients by other grou@@ ps in H@@ el@@ sin@@ ki , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a tre@@ at@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ tom pa@@ in , and in@@ de@@ ed , people have tr@@ ied it for stro@@ ke re@@ ha@@ bi@@ lit@@ ation ."
"S@@ tro@@ ke you nor@@ m@@ ally think of as dam@@ age to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some com@@ pon@@ ent of stro@@ ke par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s is also learned par@@ al@@ ysi@@ s , and maybe that com@@ pon@@ ent can be over@@ come using mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r@@ s ."
"This has also gone through c@@ lini@@ cal tri@@ als , hel@@ ping lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ wit@@ ch g@@ ear@@ s now to the third part of my talk , which is about another cu@@ ri@@ ous ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
This was disco@@ vered by Fran@@ c@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the n@@ in@@ e@@ te@@ en@@ th century .
He was a cou@@ si@@ n of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ wi@@ n .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the popul@@ ation , who are o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ mal , had the fol@@ low@@ ing pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ari@@ ty : every time they see a number , it &apos;s co@@ lo@@ red ."
"F@@ i@@ ve is blue , seven is y@@ el@@ low , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is indi@@ go , OK ?"
"Be@@ ar in mind , these people are completely nor@@ mal in other re@@ spe@@ cts ."
"O@@ r C sh@@ ar@@ p — sometimes , t@@ ones ev@@ o@@ ke color ."
"@@ C sh@@ ar@@ p is blue , F sh@@ ar@@ p is green , another t@@ one might be y@@ el@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a . G@@ al@@ ton called it syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a , a min@@ gl@@ ing of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are di@@ st@@ in@@ ct ."
These people mu@@ ddle up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two aspe@@ cts of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ru@@ ns in fam@@ il@@ ies , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a her@@ e@@ di@@ t@@ ary basi@@ s , a gen@@ e@@ tic basi@@ s ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the ma@@ in the@@ me of this le@@ cture , which is about cre@@ ati@@ vity — syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a is eight times more common am@@ ong arti@@ sts , po@@ ets , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al popul@@ ation ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ? What ca@@ uses it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ or@@ ies ."
One the@@ ory is they &apos;re just c@@ razy .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scienti@@ fic the@@ ory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther the@@ ory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ kie@@ s and po@@ the@@ ads , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tru@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an D@@ iego ."
"( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third the@@ ory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a . All right ?"
"So , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ al c@@ ross wi@@ ring between color and num@@ bers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding color , and that &apos;s why you get syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be cro@@ s@@ sed wi@@ res in some people ?
Re@@ member I said it ru@@ ns in fam@@ il@@ ies ?
That gi@@ ves you the clu@@ e .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ nor@@ mal gen@@ e , a mu@@ tation in the gen@@ e that ca@@ uses this ab@@ nor@@ mal c@@ ross wi@@ ring ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain regi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other regi@@ on , and these are tri@@ m@@ med down to create the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ stic mo@@ du@@ lar archite@@ cture of the ad@@ ul@@ t brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e ca@@ using this tri@@ m@@ ming and if that gen@@ e mu@@ t@@ ates , then you get de@@ fi@@ cient tri@@ m@@ ming between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ color syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and color , you get t@@ one@@ -@@ color syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pres@@ sed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is cro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ conne@@ cted ?"
"Well , think about what arti@@ sts , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and po@@ ets have in common , the ability to eng@@ age in me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ori@@ cal thinking , lin@@ king seem@@ ing@@ ly un@@ re@@ lated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the e@@ ast , and Ju@@ lie@@ t is the Su@@ n . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Ju@@ lie@@ t is the su@@ n , does that mean she &apos;s a gl@@ ow@@ ing ball of fi@@ re ?"
"I mean , s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ eni@@ cs do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"N@@ or@@ mal people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the su@@ n , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the su@@ n , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the su@@ n ."
"In@@ stan@@ tly , you &apos;ve found the lin@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this gre@@ ater c@@ ross wi@@ ring and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different par@@ ts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a gre@@ ater pro@@ pen@@ sity towar@@ ds me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ori@@ cal thinking and cre@@ ati@@ vity in people with syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"And , h@@ ence , the eight times more common in@@ ci@@ dence of syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a am@@ ong po@@ ets , arti@@ sts and no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ ren@@ ologi@@ cal view of syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
The last de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation — can I take one minu@@ te ?
"( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all syn@@ es@@ the@@ tes , but you &apos;re in d@@ eni@@ al about it ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s what I call Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t . J@@ ust like your al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"D@@ i@@ f@@ fer@@ ent sha@@ p@@ es for different ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , right ?"
"H@@ ere , you &apos;ve got Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t ."
"One of them is K@@ i@@ ki , one of them is B@@ ou@@ ba ."
Wh@@ ich one is K@@ i@@ ki and which one is B@@ ou@@ ba ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ i@@ ki and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ ba ? R@@ a@@ ise your h@@ ands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two mu@@ tan@@ ts ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ ba , that &apos;s K@@ i@@ ki ? R@@ a@@ ise your h@@ ands ."
N@@ in@@ e@@ ty@@ -@@ n@@ ine percent of you .
"Now , n@@ one of you is a Mar@@ ti@@ an . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ model syn@@ es@@ the@@ tic ab@@ strac@@ tion , me@@ an@@ ing you &apos;re saying that that sh@@ ar@@ p in@@ f@@ le@@ ction — ki@@ -@@ ki , in your au@@ di@@ t@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x , the ha@@ ir cells being exci@@ ted — K@@ i@@ ki , mi@@ mi@@ cs the vi@@ su@@ al in@@ f@@ le@@ ction , sud@@ den in@@ f@@ le@@ ction of that j@@ ag@@ g@@ ed sha@@ pe ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s tel@@ ling you is your brain is eng@@ ag@@ ing in a pri@@ mi@@ tive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a sil@@ ly il@@ lu@@ sion , but these ph@@ ot@@ ons in your ey@@ e are doing this sha@@ pe , and ha@@ ir cells in your e@@ ar are exci@@ ting the au@@ di@@ t@@ ory pat@@ ter@@ n , but the brain is able to ex@@ trac@@ t the common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator ."
"It &apos;s a pri@@ mi@@ tive form of ab@@ strac@@ tion , and we now know this happens in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s of the brain , because when that &apos;s dam@@ aged , these people lo@@ se the ability to eng@@ age in B@@ ou@@ ba K@@ i@@ ki , but they also lo@@ se the ability to eng@@ age in me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or ."
"If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that g@@ lit@@ ters is not g@@ old , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patien@@ t says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s me@@ tal@@ li@@ c and sh@@ iny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s g@@ old ."
"You have to meas@@ ure its speci@@ fic gra@@ vity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely mi@@ ss the me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ori@@ cal me@@ an@@ ing ."
"So , this area is about eight times the size in high@@ er — es@@ pe@@ cially in hum@@ ans — as in low@@ er pri@@ mat@@ es ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very interesting is going on here in the ang@@ ul@@ ar g@@ y@@ ru@@ s , because it &apos;s the cro@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ads between hear@@ ing , vision and tou@@ ch , and it became en@@ or@@ m@@ ous in hum@@ ans . And something very interesting is going on ."
"And I think it &apos;s a basi@@ s of many uni@@ qu@@ ely human abi@@ lit@@ ies like ab@@ strac@@ tion , me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"A@@ ll of these questions that phi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ ers have been stu@@ dy@@ ing for mi@@ l@@ len@@ nia , we scienti@@ sts can beg@@ in to expl@@ ore by doing brain imag@@ ing , and by stu@@ dy@@ ing patients and as@@ king the right questions ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) S@@ or@@ ry about that .

This story is about taking imag@@ in@@ ation seri@@ ously .
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I first en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed this ordin@@ ary materi@@ al , fi@@ sh@@ net , used the same way for cen@@ tur@@ ies ."
"T@@ od@@ ay , I &apos;m using it to create per@@ man@@ ent , bi@@ l@@ low@@ ing , v@@ olu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous form@@ s the scale of har@@ d-@@ ed@@ g@@ ed buil@@ dings in cities around the world ."
I was an un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly person to be doing this .
"I never stud@@ ied s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture , engine@@ ering or archite@@ cture ."
"In fact , after colle@@ ge I ap@@ pl@@ ied to seven art scho@@ ols and was re@@ je@@ cted by all seven ."
"I went off on my own to become an arti@@ st , and I pain@@ ted for 10 years , when I was of@@ fer@@ ed a F@@ ul@@ b@@ right to Indi@@ a ."
"P@@ ro@@ mis@@ ing to give ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions of pain@@ t@@ ings , I shi@@ pped my pain@@ ts and ar@@ ri@@ ved in Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ ali@@ pu@@ ra@@ m ."
The de@@ ad@@ line for the show ar@@ ri@@ ved — my pain@@ ts didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fi@@ sh@@ ing vi@@ ll@@ age was fam@@ ous for s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture .
So I tr@@ ied b@@ ron@@ ze ca@@ st@@ ing .
But to make large form@@ s was too he@@ av@@ y and ex@@ pen@@ sive .
"I went for a walk on the be@@ ach , wat@@ ching the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men bu@@ n@@ d@@ le their ne@@ ts into m@@ oun@@ ds on the s@@ and ."
"I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differ@@ ently — a new appro@@ ach to s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture , a way to make v@@ olu@@ me@@ tri@@ c form without he@@ av@@ y so@@ li@@ d materi@@ als ."
My first s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture was made in col@@ labor@@ ation with these fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men .
It &apos;s a self-@@ por@@ tra@@ it ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; Wi@@ de Hi@@ ps . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We ho@@ ist@@ ed them on po@@ les to photogra@@ ph .
I disco@@ vered their so@@ ft sur@@ fac@@ es re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed every ri@@ pp@@ le of wind in con@@ stan@@ tly chang@@ ing pat@@ ter@@ ns .
I was m@@ es@@ m@@ eri@@ zed .
"I contin@@ u@@ ed stu@@ dy@@ ing c@@ ra@@ ft tra@@ di@@ tions and col@@ labor@@ ating with arti@@ s@@ ans , next in Li@@ th@@ u@@ ania with l@@ ace mak@@ ers ."
"I li@@ ked the f@@ ine de@@ ta@@ il it gave my work , but I wanted to make them lar@@ ger — to shi@@ ft from being an obje@@ ct you look at to something you could get lost in ."
"R@@ e@@ tur@@ ning to Indi@@ a to work with those fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men , we made a net of a million and a half hand@@ -@@ t@@ ied k@@ n@@ ots — in@@ stal@@ led br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d ."
"Th@@ ous@@ ands of people saw it , and one of them was the urb@@ ani@@ st M@@ an@@ u@@ al S@@ ol@@ a@@ -@@ M@@ or@@ al@@ es who was re@@ desig@@ ning the wat@@ er@@ front in P@@ or@@ to , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al ."
He asked if I could build this as a per@@ man@@ ent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and pre@@ ser@@ ve my art .
"D@@ u@@ ra@@ ble , engine@@ er@@ ed , per@@ man@@ ent — those are in op@@ posi@@ tion to i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ c@@ r@@ atic , de@@ lic@@ ate and e@@ ph@@ em@@ er@@ al ."
"For two years , I sear@@ ched for a fi@@ ber that could survi@@ ve ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ra@@ ys , s@@ al@@ t , air , pol@@ lu@@ tion , and at the same time re@@ ma@@ in so@@ ft enough to move flu@@ i@@ d@@ ly in the wind ."
We needed something to h@@ old the net up out there in the mi@@ ddle of the traf@@ fic cir@@ cle .
"So we ra@@ is@@ ed this 4@@ 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ po@@ u@@ nd ste@@ el ring ."
We had to engine@@ er it to move g@@ rac@@ e@@ fully in an a@@ ver@@ age bre@@ e@@ ze and survi@@ ve in h@@ ur@@ ri@@ c@@ ane win@@ ds .
But there was no engine@@ ering so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to model something po@@ rou@@ s and moving .
I found a bri@@ lli@@ ant a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical engine@@ er who desig@@ ns sa@@ il@@ s for America &apos;s C@@ up rac@@ ing y@@ ach@@ ts na@@ med Pe@@ ter H@@ e@@ p@@ pe@@ l .
He hel@@ ped me t@@ ac@@ k@@ le the t@@ wi@@ n challen@@ ges of pre@@ ci@@ se sha@@ pe and g@@ ent@@ le movement .
I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand@@ -@@ t@@ ied k@@ n@@ ots wer@@ en &apos;t going to with@@ stand a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ c@@ ane .
"So I develo@@ ped a relation@@ ship with an indu@@ stri@@ al fi@@ sh@@ net fac@@ t@@ ory , learned the v@@ ari@@ ab@@ les of their mach@@ ines , and figu@@ red out a way to make l@@ ace with them ."
"There was no language to trans@@ l@@ ate this an@@ cient , i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ c@@ r@@ atic hand@@ c@@ ra@@ ft into something mach@@ ine oper@@ at@@ ors could produ@@ ce ."
So we had to create one .
"Th@@ ree years and two children later , we ra@@ is@@ ed this 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ squ@@ are@@ -@@ fo@@ ot l@@ ace net ."
"It was hard to believe that what I had imag@@ ined was now built , per@@ man@@ ent and had lost nothing in trans@@ l@@ ation ."
( Applause ) This inter@@ se@@ ction had been bl@@ and and an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I wal@@ ked under@@ ne@@ ath it for the first time .
"As I wat@@ ched the wind &apos;s cho@@ re@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y un@@ f@@ old , I felt sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed and , at the same time , conne@@ cted to li@@ mi@@ t@@ less sk@@ y ."
My life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these o@@ ases of s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture in sp@@ ac@@ es of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share two dire@@ ctions that are new in my work .
"H@@ i@@ stor@@ ic P@@ h@@ il@@ a@@ de@@ l@@ phi@@ a C@@ ity H@@ all : its pla@@ za , I felt , needed a materi@@ al for s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture that was li@@ gh@@ ter than ne@@ tting ."
"So we experim@@ en@@ ted with t@@ iny at@@ omi@@ zed water parti@@ cles to create a d@@ ry mi@@ st that is sha@@ ped by the wind and in test@@ ing , disco@@ vered that it can be sha@@ ped by people who can inter@@ act and move through it without getting w@@ et ."
I &apos;m using this s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture materi@@ al to tr@@ ace the pa@@ ths of sub@@ way tra@@ ins ab@@ o@@ ve ground in real time — like an X@@ -@@ ra@@ y of the city &apos;s cir@@ cu@@ lat@@ ory system un@@ fol@@ ding .
"N@@ ex@@ t challen@@ ge , the B@@ ien@@ ni@@ al of the Ameri@@ c@@ as in D@@ en@@ ver asked , could I re@@ present the 3@@ 5 n@@ ations of the W@@ est@@ er@@ n he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here and their inter@@ conne@@ c@@ te@@ d@@ ness in a s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ?"
"( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to beg@@ in , but I said y@@ es ."
I read about the re@@ cent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in Chi@@ le and the t@@ su@@ nami that ri@@ pp@@ led across the entire P@@ aci@@ fic O@@ ce@@ an .
"It shi@@ f@@ ted the Earth &apos;s te@@ ct@@ on@@ ic pl@@ ates , sp@@ ed up the planet &apos;s ro@@ tation and liter@@ ally shor@@ ten@@ ed the len@@ g@@ th of the day ."
"So I cont@@ ac@@ ted N@@ O@@ A@@ A , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the t@@ su@@ nami , and trans@@ lated it into this ."
I@@ ts ti@@ tle : &quot; &quot; 1@@ .@@ 2@@ 6 &quot; &quot; ref@@ ers to the number of micro@@ secon@@ ds that the Earth &apos;s day was shor@@ ten@@ ed .
"I couldn &apos;t build this with a ste@@ el ring , the way I knew ."
I@@ ts sha@@ pe was too comple@@ x now .
"So I re@@ plac@@ ed the me@@ tal ar@@ mat@@ ure with a so@@ ft , f@@ ine m@@ es@@ h of a fi@@ ber 15 times stron@@ ger than ste@@ el ."
"The s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture could now be enti@@ re@@ ly so@@ ft , which made it so light it could t@@ ie in to ex@@ ist@@ ing buil@@ dings — liter@@ ally be@@ coming part of the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the city ."
There was no so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that could ex@@ tru@@ de these comple@@ x net form@@ s and model them with gra@@ vity .
So we had to create it .
Th@@ en I got a call from New York C@@ ity as@@ king if I could ad@@ ap@@ t these con@@ cep@@ ts to T@@ im@@ es S@@ qu@@ are or the Hi@@ gh L@@ ine .
This new so@@ ft stru@@ ctu@@ ral meth@@ od en@@ ab@@ les me to model these and build these s@@ cul@@ p@@ tu@@ res at the scale of sk@@ y@@ sc@@ ra@@ per@@ s .
"They don &apos;t have fun@@ ding yet , but I dre@@ am now of br@@ ing@@ ing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed ."
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I sear@@ ched for beau@@ ty in the tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal things , in c@@ ra@@ ft form@@ s ."
"Now I com@@ b@@ ine them with hi@@ -@@ te@@ ch materi@@ als and engine@@ ering to create v@@ olu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous , bi@@ l@@ low@@ ing form@@ s the scale of buil@@ dings ."
My arti@@ stic h@@ ori@@ z@@ ons contin@@ ue to gro@@ w .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x .
"A@@ n at@@ tor@@ ney in the offi@@ ce who &apos;d never been interested in art , never visi@@ ted the local art mus@@ e@@ um , dra@@ gg@@ ed everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down under@@ ne@@ ath the s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ."
"There they were in their business su@@ its , la@@ ying in the gra@@ ss , noti@@ cing the chang@@ ing pat@@ ter@@ ns of wind be@@ side people they didn &apos;t know , sh@@ aring the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
