"When I was 11 , I remember w@@ a@@ king up one morning to the sound of jo@@ y in my house ."
"My father was lis@@ ten@@ ing to B@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws on his small , gr@@ ay radi@@ o ."
"There was a big s@@ mi@@ le on his face which was un@@ usu@@ al then , because the news mo@@ st@@ ly de@@ pr@@ essed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A morning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over Afgh@@ an@@ istan and made it il@@ leg@@ al for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I dr@@ essed as a bo@@ y to es@@ cor@@ t my ol@@ der s@@ ister , who was no longer al@@ lowed to be outside alone , to a secre@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be e@@ duc@@ ated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different rou@@ te so that no one would su@@ sp@@ ect where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our books in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would se@@ em we were just out sh@@ op@@ ping .
"The school was in a house , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small living room ."
It was co@@ z@@ y in win@@ ter but ext@@ rem@@ ely ho@@ t in sum@@ mer .
"We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the tea@@ cher , the students and our parents ."
"F@@ ro@@ m time to time , the school would sudd@@ en@@ ly be can@@ cel@@ ed for a week because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were su@@ sp@@ ici@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being fol@@ lowed ?
D@@ o they know where we live ?
"We were s@@ car@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very l@@ uc@@ ky to grow up in a family where education was pr@@ iz@@ ed and d@@ augh@@ ters were tre@@ a@@ su@@ red .
My grand@@ father was an extraordin@@ ary man for his time .
"A tot@@ al m@@ aver@@ ick from a rem@@ ote pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce of Afgh@@ an@@ istan , he ins@@ is@@ ted that his d@@ aughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was dis@@ ow@@ ned by his father ."
But my e@@ duc@@ ated mother became a tea@@ cher .
There she is .
"She re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for gir@@ ls and women in our neigh@@ bor@@ hood ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to re@@ ce@@ ive an education .
"There was no question that his children would re@@ ce@@ ive an education , inclu@@ ding his d@@ augh@@ ters , des@@ p@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , des@@ p@@ ite the ris@@ ks ."
"T@@ o him , there was gre@@ ater risk in not e@@ duc@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years , I remember there were times I would get so fr@@ ustr@@ ated by our life and always being s@@ car@@ ed and not seeing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , my d@@ aughter , you can lo@@ se everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be forc@@ ed to leave your home during a war .
"But the one thing that will always rem@@ ain with you is what is here , and if we have to s@@ ell our bloo@@ d to pay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was rais@@ ed in a country that has been des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed by dec@@ ades of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ y@@ ond high school , and had my family not been so comm@@ it@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"In@@ st@@ ead , I st@@ and here a pr@@ oud grad@@ u@@ ate of M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ bur@@ y C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ en I re@@ turned to Afgh@@ an@@ istan , my grand@@ father , the one ex@@ il@@ ed from his home for dar@@ ing to e@@ duc@@ ate his d@@ augh@@ ters , was am@@ ong the first to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate me ."
"He not only br@@ ag@@ s about my colle@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l ."
( Applause ) My family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ ams even bigg@@ er for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ b@@ ass@@ ad@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n to e@@ duc@@ ate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for gir@@ ls in Afgh@@ an@@ istan , a country where it &apos;s still ris@@ ky for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
The exc@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with ambi@@ tion gr@@ ab@@ b@@ ing at opportunity .
"And I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate for them , des@@ p@@ ite and even in the face of d@@ aun@@ ting op@@ position ."
"L@@ i@@ ke A@@ h@@ m@@ ed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ m@@ ed is the father of one of my students ."
"L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his d@@ aughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their village , and they literally m@@ iss@@ ed being kill@@ ed by a ro@@ ad@@ side b@@ om@@ b by minutes ."
"As he arri@@ ved home , the phone ran@@ g , a vo@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he sent his d@@ aughter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my d@@ aughter &apos;s future because of your old and back@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realiz@@ e about Afgh@@ an@@ istan , and this is something that is often dis@@ m@@ iss@@ ed in the W@@ est , that behind most of us who suc@@ ce@@ ed is a father who recogni@@ z@@ es the value in his d@@ aughter and who se@@ es that her succ@@ ess is his succ@@ ess ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mo@@ thers ar@@ en &apos;t key in our succ@@ ess .
"In fact , they &apos;re often the initi@@ al and conv@@ inc@@ ing ne@@ go@@ ti@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their d@@ augh@@ ters , but in the cont@@ ext of a society like in Afgh@@ an@@ istan , we must have the support of men ."
"@@ Un@@ der the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , gir@@ ls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hundreds — remember , it was il@@ leg@@ al ."
"But today , more than three million gir@@ ls are in school in Afgh@@ an@@ istan ."
( Applause ) Afgh@@ an@@ istan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Amer@@ ic@@ ans see the fr@@ ag@@ il@@ ity in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much be@@ y@@ ond the U.S. tro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in Afgh@@ an@@ istan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate for them , who encour@@ age them , I see a prom@@ is@@ ing future and l@@ as@@ ting change ."
"T@@ o me , Afgh@@ an@@ istan is a country of hope and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less possibil@@ ities , and every single day the gir@@ ls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"L@@ i@@ ke me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
And you &apos;ll now see the y@@ ol@@ k and the white have se@@ par@@ ated .
And sli@@ gh@@ tly more complex things app@@ ear .
That &apos;s tw@@ ice as long as humans have been on this planet .
"And de@@ ep bene@@ ath those oce@@ ans , at cr@@ ac@@ ks in the Earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , you &apos;ve got he@@ at see@@ ping up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great di@@ versity of el@@ ements ."
"But of course , life is more than just ex@@ o@@ tic chem@@ is@@ try ."
H@@ um@@ an be@@ ings start pu@@ tting each other into bo@@ x@@ es the second that they see each other — I@@ s that person danger@@ ous ? A@@ re they attr@@ active ?
A@@ re they a potenti@@ al m@@ ate ? A@@ re they a potenti@@ al net@@ working opportunity ?
We do this little inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation when we me@@ et people to make a mental res@@ u@@ me for them .
What &apos;s your name ? Wh@@ ere are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Th@@ en we get more pers@@ onal with it .
H@@ ave you ever had any dis@@ eas@@ es ?
H@@ ave you ever been di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed ?
D@@ o@@ es your bre@@ ath sm@@ ell bad while you &apos;re ans@@ wer@@ ing my inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation right now ?
What are you into ? Wh@@ o are you into ?
What g@@ end@@ er do you like to s@@ le@@ ep with ?
I get it .
We are neuro@@ log@@ ically har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to see@@ k out people like ourselves .
We start form@@ ing cli@@ ques as so@@ on as we &apos;re old enough to know what accep@@ t@@ ance fe@@ els like .
"We bon@@ d together based on anything that we can — music pre@@ fer@@ ence , r@@ ace , g@@ end@@ er , the bloc@@ k that we gre@@ w up on ."
We see@@ k out environ@@ ments that re@@ in@@ force our pers@@ onal cho@@ ices .
"S@@ ome@@ times , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s op@@ en@@ ing a tiny little box and as@@ king you to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze yourself inside of it ."
"Because the cat@@ eg@@ ories , I &apos;ve found , are too lim@@ iting ."
The bo@@ x@@ es are too n@@ ar@@ row .
And this can get really danger@@ ous .
"So here &apos;s a dis@@ cl@@ ai@@ mer about me , though , before we get too de@@ ep into this ."
I gre@@ w up in a very sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed environment .
"I was rais@@ ed in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an in the early 19@@ 8@@ 0s , two bloc@@ ks from the e@@ pic@@ enter of p@@ un@@ k music ."
I was shi@@ el@@ ded from the p@@ ains of bi@@ g@@ ot@@ ry and the social res@@ tr@@ ic@@ tions of a religi@@ ous@@ ly@@ -@@ based up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing .
"Wh@@ ere I come from , if you wer@@ en &apos;t a dra@@ g qu@@ e@@ en or a radic@@ al thin@@ ker or a performan@@ ce arti@@ st of some kind , you were the we@@ ir@@ do ."
"( Laughter ) It was an un@@ or@@ tho@@ do@@ x up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing , but as a ki@@ d on the stre@@ ets of New York , you learn how to tr@@ ust your own inst@@ inc@@ ts , you learn how to go with your own ideas ."
"So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a bo@@ y ."
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play bas@@ k@@ et@@ ball with them .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let gir@@ ls play .
"So I went home , and I sh@@ av@@ ed my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a bo@@ y . &quot; &quot; I mean , who kno@@ ws , right ?"
"When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that ."
"I didn &apos;t want any@@ one to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t ."
I ke@@ pt up the char@@ ade for eight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was pl@@ aying a ki@@ d nam@@ ed W@@ al@@ ter in a mo@@ vie called &quot; &quot; Ju@@ li@@ an P@@ o . &quot; &quot; I was a little stre@@ et tou@@ g@@ h that fol@@ lowed Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an S@@ later around and b@@ ad@@ g@@ ered him .
"S@@ ee , I was also a child act@@ or , which dou@@ bl@@ ed up the l@@ ay@@ ers of the performan@@ ce of my identi@@ ty , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really pl@@ aying a bo@@ y ."
"In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my tea@@ chers at school , not my friends , not the direc@@ tors that I worked with ."
K@@ ids would often come up to me in clas@@ s and gr@@ a@@ b me by the thro@@ at to ch@@ ec@@ k for an A@@ d@@ am &apos;s app@@ le or gr@@ a@@ b my cr@@ ot@@ ch to ch@@ ec@@ k what I was working with .
"When I would go to the b@@ ath@@ room , I would turn my sho@@ es around in the st@@ all@@ s so that it looked like I was pe@@ e@@ ing st@@ anding up ."
A@@ t s@@ le@@ e@@ po@@ vers I would have pan@@ ic att@@ ac@@ ks trying to brea@@ k it to gir@@ ls that they didn &apos;t want to k@@ is@@ s me without ou@@ ting myself .
It &apos;s wor@@ th m@@ enti@@ on@@ ing though that I didn &apos;t h@@ ate my body or my gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was per@@ form@@ ing this el@@ abor@@ ate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ed as trans@@ g@@ end@@ er .
"If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in ther@@ ap@@ y , they probably would have diagno@@ s@@ ed me as something like g@@ end@@ er dy@@ s@@ mor@@ ph@@ ic and put me on hor@@ mon@@ es to st@@ ave off pu@@ ber@@ ty ."
"But in my particular case , I just w@@ o@@ ke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again ."
"P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty had h@@ it , and I had no idea what being a girl me@@ ant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was ."
"When a ki@@ d behav@@ es like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?"
No one is exactly sh@@ oc@@ ked .
( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to def@@ ine myself by my parents .
"When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fall@@ en in love , it was the last thing on either of our min@@ ds to discus@@ s what the conse@@ qu@@ ences were of the fact that my first love was a girl ."
"Th@@ ree years later , when I f@@ ell in love with a man , ne@@ i@@ ther of my parents bat@@ ted an ey@@ el@@ ash either ."
"S@@ ee , it &apos;s one of the great bl@@ ess@@ ings of my very un@@ or@@ tho@@ do@@ x chil@@ d@@ hood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to def@@ ine myself as any one thing at any point ."
"I was just al@@ lowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment ."
"So four , almost five years ago , Pro@@ position 8 , the great mar@@ ri@@ age equ@@ ality de@@ b@@ ate , was rais@@ ing a lot of d@@ ust around this country ."
"And at the time , getting mar@@ ried wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about ."
"But I was struc@@ k by the fact that America , a country with such a tar@@ n@@ ished civi@@ l ri@@ ghts re@@ cord , could be re@@ pe@@ ating its mis@@ takes so bl@@ at@@ antly ."
"And I remember wat@@ ching the discus@@ sion on tel@@ ev@@ ision and thinking how interesting it was that the se@@ par@@ ation of ch@@ ur@@ ch and state was essenti@@ ally dra@@ wing ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ ical b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out this country , between places where people beli@@ ev@@ ed in it and places where people didn &apos;t ."
"And then , that this discus@@ sion was dra@@ wing ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ ical b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies around me ."
"If this was a war with two dispar@@ ate si@@ des , I , by def@@ au@@ l@@ t , f@@ ell on team g@@ ay , because I certain@@ ly wasn &apos;t 100 percent str@@ ai@@ ght ."
"A@@ t the time I was just beginning to emer@@ ge from this ei@@ gh@@ t-@@ year pers@@ onal identi@@ ty cr@@ is@@ is z@@ ig@@ z@@ a@@ g that saw me go from being a bo@@ y to being this aw@@ k@@ ward girl that looked like a bo@@ y in girl &apos;s clo@@ th@@ es to the op@@ pos@@ ite ex@@ tre@@ me of this super sk@@ imp@@ y , over@@ -@@ com@@ pens@@ ating , bo@@ y-@@ ch@@ as@@ ing gir@@ ly@@ -@@ girl to finally just a h@@ es@@ it@@ ant explor@@ ation of what I actually was , a tom@@ bo@@ y@@ ish girl who li@@ ked both bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls depend@@ ing on the person ."
"I had spent a year photograp@@ h@@ ing this new gener@@ ation of gir@@ ls , much like myself , who f@@ ell kind of bet@@ we@@ en-@@ the@@ -@@ l@@ ines — gir@@ ls who sk@@ at@@ e@@ bo@@ ar@@ ded but did it in l@@ acy under@@ w@@ ear , gir@@ ls who had bo@@ ys &apos; h@@ air@@ cu@@ ts but w@@ o@@ re gir@@ ly n@@ ail pol@@ ish , gir@@ ls who had ey@@ es@@ h@@ ado@@ w to mat@@ ch their s@@ cr@@ ap@@ ed k@@ ne@@ es , gir@@ ls who li@@ ked gir@@ ls and bo@@ ys who all li@@ ked bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls who all h@@ ated being bo@@ x@@ ed in to anything ."
"I lo@@ ved these people , and I ad@@ mi@@ red their fre@@ e@@ dom , but I wat@@ ched as the world outside of our u@@ t@@ op@@ ian bu@@ b@@ ble explo@@ ded into these r@@ ag@@ ing de@@ b@@ ates where p@@ un@@ d@@ its started lik@@ en@@ ing our love to bes@@ ti@@ ality on national tel@@ ev@@ ision ."
"And this powerful aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess ro@@ l@@ led in over me that I was a min@@ or@@ ity , and in my own home country , based on one fac@@ et of my char@@ ac@@ ter ."
I was leg@@ ally and in@@ dis@@ pu@@ tab@@ ly a secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en .
I was not an acti@@ vis@@ t .
I w@@ ave no fl@@ ag@@ s in my own life .
But I was pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed by this question : How could any@@ one v@@ ote to str@@ i@@ p the ri@@ ghts of the v@@ ast vari@@ ety of people that I knew based on one el@@ ement of their char@@ ac@@ ter ?
How could they say that we as a group were not des@@ er@@ ving of equ@@ al ri@@ ghts as somebody else ?
W@@ ere we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even consci@@ ously met a vic@@ ti@@ m of their dis@@ crimin@@ ation ?
D@@ id they know who they were v@@ ot@@ ing against and what the impact was ?
"And then it oc@@ cur@@ red to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were cas@@ ting into secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ ship it might make it har@@ der for them to do ."
It might give them p@@ ause .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same din@@ ner par@@ ty , so I figu@@ red out a way where I could intro@@ du@@ ce them to each other photograp@@ h@@ ically without any arti@@ fi@@ ce , without any li@@ gh@@ ting , or without any mani@@ pul@@ ation of any kind on my part ."
Because in a photograp@@ h you can exam@@ ine a lion &apos;s wh@@ is@@ kers without the fear of him ri@@ p@@ ping your face off .
"For me , photograp@@ h@@ y is not just about ex@@ pos@@ ing film , it &apos;s about ex@@ pos@@ ing the vie@@ wer to something new , a place they hav@@ en &apos;t gone before , but most import@@ antly , to people that they might be af@@ rai@@ d of ."
"L@@ i@@ fe mag@@ az@@ ine intro@@ duc@@ ed gener@@ ations of people to dis@@ tant , far@@ -@@ off cul@@ tures they never knew ex@@ is@@ ted through pic@@ tures ."
"So I decided to make a ser@@ ies of very simple por@@ trai@@ ts , mu@@ g@@ sh@@ ots if you will ."
"And I basically decided to photograp@@ h any@@ one in this country that was not 100 percent str@@ ai@@ ght , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a lim@@ it@@ less number of people ."
"( Laughter ) So this was a very large under@@ taking , and to do it we needed some help ."
"So I ran out in the fre@@ e@@ z@@ ing c@@ old , and I photograp@@ h@@ ed every single person that I knew that I could get to in F@@ e@@ bru@@ ary of about two years ago ."
"And I took those photograp@@ h@@ s , and I went to the H@@ R@@ C and I asked them for some help ."
And they fun@@ ded two weeks of sho@@ ot@@ ing in New York .
And then we made this .
"( Music ) V@@ ide@@ o : I &apos;m i@@ O T@@ ill@@ et@@ t W@@ right , and I &apos;m an arti@@ st born and rais@@ ed in New York C@@ ity . ( Music )"
S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is a photograp@@ hi@@ c re@@ cord of L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q America today .
My ai@@ m is to take a simple por@@ tr@@ ait of any@@ one who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent str@@ ai@@ ght or fe@@ els like they f@@ all in the L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q spec@@ tru@@ m in any way .
My go@@ al is to show the human@@ ity that ex@@ ists in every one of us through the simpl@@ ic@@ ity of a face .
( Music ) &quot; We hold these tru@@ ths to be self-@@ ev@@ id@@ ent that all men are created equ@@ al . &quot;
It &apos;s wr@@ it@@ ten in the D@@ ec@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ depend@@ ence .
We are fai@@ ling as a n@@ ation to u@@ ph@@ old the mor@@ als u@@ pon which we were f@@ oun@@ ded .
There is no equ@@ ality in the United States .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; What does equ@@ ality mean to you ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; M@@ arri@@ age &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ i@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ re@@ at every person as you &apos;d tre@@ at yourself &quot; &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that ."
The fi@@ ght for equ@@ al ri@@ ghts is not just about g@@ ay mar@@ ri@@ age .
"T@@ o@@ day in 2@@ 9 st@@ ates , more than half of this country , you can leg@@ ally be fi@@ red just for your sex@@ u@@ ality ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o is respon@@ sible for equ@@ ality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all respon@@ sible for equ@@ ality . &quot;
So far we &apos;ve sho@@ t 3@@ 00 fac@@ es in New York C@@ ity .
And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the gener@@ ous support of the H@@ um@@ an Ri@@ ghts C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n .
I want to take the project across the country .
"I want to vis@@ it 25 American cities , and I want to sho@@ ot 4@@ ,000 or 5@@ ,000 people ."
This is my contribu@@ tion to the civi@@ l ri@@ ghts fi@@ ght of my gener@@ ation .
I challenge you to look into the fac@@ es of these people and tell them that they des@@ er@@ ve less than any other human being .
"( Music ) &#91; &quot; &quot; S@@ el@@ f ev@@ id@@ ent tru@@ ths &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; 4@@ ,000 fac@@ es across America &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Music ) ( Applause ) i@@ O T@@ ill@@ et@@ t W@@ right : A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely nothing could have pre@@ par@@ ed us for what happened after that ."
"A@@ l@@ most 8@@ 5@@ ,000 people wat@@ ched that video , and then they started em@@ ail@@ ing us from all over the country , as@@ king us to come to their to@@ w@@ ns and help them to show their fac@@ es ."
And a lot more people wanted to show their fac@@ es than I had anti@@ cip@@ ated .
"So I changed my im@@ medi@@ ate go@@ al to 1@@ 0,000 fac@@ es ."
"That video was made in the s@@ pr@@ ing of 20@@ 11 , and as of today I have trav@@ el@@ ed to almost 20 cities and photograp@@ h@@ ed almost 2@@ ,000 people ."
"I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minute of just qui@@ et and have you just look at these fac@@ es because there is nothing that I can say that will ad@@ d to them ."
"Because if a picture is wor@@ th a thou@@ sand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary ."
"So after trav@@ eling and talking to people in places like O@@ k@@ la@@ hom@@ a or sm@@ all@@ -@@ to@@ wn T@@ ex@@ as , we found ev@@ id@@ ence that the initi@@ al pre@@ m@@ ise was d@@ ead on ."
V@@ is@@ i@@ bil@@ ity really is key .
F@@ am@@ ili@@ ar@@ ity really is the g@@ at@@ e@@ way dru@@ g to emp@@ ath@@ y .
"O@@ n@@ ce an issue po@@ ps up in your own back@@ y@@ ard or am@@ ong@@ st your own family , you &apos;re far more lik@@ ely to explo@@ re sym@@ p@@ ath@@ y for it or explo@@ re a new perspective on it ."
"O@@ f course , in my trav@@ els I met people who leg@@ ally di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed their children for being other than str@@ ai@@ ght , but I also met people who were Sou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ tis@@ ts who s@@ wit@@ ched ch@@ ur@@ ches because their child was a les@@ bi@@ an ."
S@@ par@@ king emp@@ ath@@ y had become the back@@ bone of S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths .
But here &apos;s what I was starting to learn that was really interesting : S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths doesn &apos;t er@@ ase the differ@@ ences between us .
"In fact , on the contr@@ ary , it high@@ li@@ ghts them ."
"It pres@@ ents , not just the complex@@ ities found in a proces@@ sion of different human be@@ ings , but the complex@@ ities found within each individual person ."
"It wasn &apos;t that we had too many bo@@ x@@ es , it was that we had too few ."
"A@@ t some point I realized that my mission to photograp@@ h &quot; &quot; g@@ ays &quot; &quot; was in@@ her@@ ently fl@@ aw@@ ed , because there were a million different sh@@ ades of g@@ ay ."
"H@@ ere I was trying to help , and I had per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated the very thing I had spent my life trying to av@@ o@@ id — yet another box ."
A@@ t some point I ad@@ ded a question to the rel@@ ease form that asked people to quanti@@ f@@ y themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent g@@ ay .
And I wat@@ ched so many ex@@ is@@ tenti@@ al cr@@ is@@ es un@@ f@@ old in front of me .
( Laughter ) P@@ eople didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been pres@@ ented with the op@@ tion before .
C@@ an you quanti@@ f@@ y your op@@ enn@@ ess ?
"O@@ n@@ ce they got over the sh@@ oc@@ k , though , by and large people op@@ ted for some@@ where between 70 to 9@@ 5 percent or the 3 to 20 percent mar@@ ks ."
"O@@ f course , there were lots of people who op@@ ted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much larg@@ er pro@@ por@@ tion of people identi@@ fi@@ ed as something that was much more nu@@ anc@@ ed ."
I found that most people f@@ all on a spec@@ tru@@ m of what I have come to re@@ f@@ er to as &quot; &quot; Gre@@ y . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that pre@@ fer@@ ence doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
"And I am not even going to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s the issue of cho@@ ice ver@@ sus biolo@@ gical im@@ per@@ ative , because if any of you happen to be of the beli@@ ef that sex@@ u@@ al ori@@ ent@@ ation is a cho@@ ice , I inv@@ ite you to go out and try to be gre@@ y ."
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human be@@ ings are not on@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal .
"The most important thing to take from the per@@ cent@@ age system is this : If you have g@@ ay people over here and you have str@@ ai@@ ght people over here , and while we recogni@@ ze that most people identi@@ f@@ y as some@@ where clo@@ ser to one b@@ in@@ ary or another , there is this v@@ ast spec@@ tru@@ m of people that ex@@ ist in between ."
And the reality that this pres@@ ents is a compl@@ ic@@ ated one .
"Because , for example , if you pas@@ s a la@@ w that allo@@ ws a bo@@ ss to fi@@ re an employ@@ ee for hom@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al behavior , where exactly do you dra@@ w the line ?"
"I@@ s it over here , by the people who have had one or two h@@ et@@ er@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al experi@@ ences so far ?"
O@@ r is it over here by the people who have only had one or two hom@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al experi@@ ences th@@ us far ?
Wh@@ ere exactly does one become a secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ?
A@@ no@@ ther interesting thing that I learned from my project and my trav@@ els is just what a poor b@@ in@@ ding ag@@ ent sex@@ u@@ al ori@@ ent@@ ation is .
"A@@ f@@ ter trav@@ eling so much and me@@ eting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many j@@ er@@ ks and s@@ wee@@ the@@ ar@@ ts and D@@ emo@@ cr@@ ats and Re@@ public@@ ans and j@@ oc@@ ks and qu@@ e@@ ens and every other pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation you can possi@@ bly think of within the L@@ G@@ B@@ T community as there are within the human r@@ ace ."
"A@@ side from the fact that we play with one leg@@ al hand ti@@ ed behind our b@@ ac@@ ks , and once you get past the shar@@ ed n@@ arr@@ ative of pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce and stru@@ gg@@ le , just being other than str@@ ai@@ ght doesn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily mean that we have anything in common ."
"So in the end@@ less pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of fac@@ es that S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is always be@@ coming , as it hop@@ e@@ fully appe@@ ars across more and more plat@@ form@@ s , b@@ us sh@@ el@@ ters , b@@ ill@@ bo@@ ards , F@@ ace@@ book p@@ ages , scre@@ en sav@@ ers , perhaps in wat@@ ching this proces@@ sion of human@@ ity , something interesting and us@@ e@@ ful will beg@@ in to happen ."
"H@@ op@@ e@@ fully these cat@@ eg@@ ories , these b@@ in@@ ar@@ ies , these over@@ -@@ simpl@@ ifi@@ ed bo@@ x@@ es will beg@@ in to become us@@ el@@ ess and they &apos;ll beg@@ in to f@@ all away ."
"Because really , they descri@@ be nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are ."
What we see are human be@@ ings in all their multi@@ pl@@ ic@@ ity .
And seeing them makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their human@@ ity .
A@@ t the very least I hope it makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their human ri@@ ghts .
"So is it me particul@@ arly that you would cho@@ ose to den@@ y the right to hou@@ sing , the right to adop@@ t children , the right to mar@@ ri@@ age , the fre@@ e@@ dom to sho@@ p here , live here , buy here ?"
"A@@ m I the one that you cho@@ ose to dis@@ own as your child or your bro@@ ther or your s@@ ister or your mother or your father , your neigh@@ b@@ or , your cou@@ s@@ in , your un@@ cle , the pres@@ id@@ ent , your police woman or the fi@@ rem@@ an ?"
It &apos;s too l@@ ate .
Because I already am all of those things .
"We already are all of those things , and we always have been ."
"So pl@@ ease don &apos;t gre@@ et us as str@@ ang@@ ers , gre@@ et us as your fel@@ low human be@@ ings , per@@ i@@ od ."
Thank you .

I &apos;m 1@@ 50 feet down an il@@ leg@@ al mine sh@@ af@@ t in G@@ h@@ ana .

"I got to clim@@ b out of that ho@@ le , and I got to go home , but they lik@@ ely never will , because they &apos;re tr@@ app@@ ed in sl@@ av@@ ery ."
"For the last 2@@ 8 years , I &apos;ve been doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ing indi@@ gen@@ ous cul@@ tures in more than 70 countries on six contin@@ ents , and in 200@@ 9 I had the great hon@@ or of being the so@@ le ex@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ or at the V@@ an@@ cou@@ ver P@@ ea@@ ce S@@ um@@ m@@ it ."
"A@@ mon@@ g@@ st all the as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing people I met there , I met a sup@@ porter of F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves , an N@@ G@@ O de@@ dic@@ ated to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ating moder@@ n day sl@@ av@@ ery ."
"We started talking about sl@@ av@@ ery , and really , I started learning about sl@@ av@@ ery , for I had certain@@ ly known it ex@@ is@@ ted in the world , but not to such a de@@ gre@@ e ."
"A@@ f@@ ter we fin@@ ished talking , I felt so hor@@ ri@@ ble and hon@@ est@@ ly ash@@ am@@ ed at my own l@@ ack of knowledge of this a@@ tro@@ city in my own li@@ fe@@ time , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?"
"It started bur@@ ning a ho@@ le in my st@@ om@@ ach , so within weeks , I f@@ le@@ w down to L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es to me@@ et with the direc@@ tor of F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves and off@@ er them my help ."
Th@@ us began my jour@@ ney into moder@@ n day sl@@ av@@ ery .
"O@@ dd@@ ly , I had been to many of these places before ."
S@@ ome I even consi@@ der@@ ed like my second home .
"But this time , I would see the sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons hi@@ dd@@ en in the clo@@ set ."
A con@@ serv@@ ative esti@@ m@@ ate tel@@ ls us there are more than 2@@ 7 million people en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed in the world today .
That &apos;s dou@@ ble the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans@@ -@@ A@@ t@@ l@@ an@@ tic sl@@ ave tra@@ de .
"A hundre@@ d and fi@@ f@@ ty years ago , an agricul@@ tural sl@@ ave cost about three times the ann@@ u@@ al sal@@ ary of an American wor@@ ker ."
"That equ@@ ates to about $ 5@@ 0,000 in today &apos;s money ."
"@@ Y@@ et today , entire famil@@ ies can be en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed for gener@@ ations over a de@@ b@@ t as small as $ 18 ."
"A@@ st@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly , sl@@ av@@ ery gener@@ ates prof@@ its of more than $ 1@@ 3 billion wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de each year ."
"M@@ any have been tr@@ ic@@ ked by f@@ al@@ se prom@@ is@@ es of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forc@@ ed to work without pay under the thre@@ at of violence , and they cannot walk away ."
"T@@ o@@ day &apos;s sl@@ av@@ ery is about commer@@ ce , so the go@@ o@@ ds that en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed people produce have value , but the people produc@@ ing them are dis@@ pos@@ able ."
"S@@ l@@ av@@ ery ex@@ ists every@@ where , ne@@ arly , in the world , and yet it is il@@ leg@@ al every@@ where in the world ."
"In India and N@@ ep@@ al , I was intro@@ duc@@ ed to the br@@ ick kil@@ ns ."
This str@@ ange and aw@@ es@@ ome si@@ ght was like wal@@ king into anci@@ ent E@@ gy@@ pt or D@@ ante &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
"En@@ velop@@ ed in tem@@ per@@ atures of 1@@ 30 de@@ gre@@ es , men , women , children , entire famil@@ ies in fact , were clo@@ a@@ ked in a he@@ av@@ y blan@@ k@@ et of d@@ ust , while me@@ chan@@ ically st@@ ac@@ king br@@ ic@@ ks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and car@@ r@@ ying them from the s@@ cor@@ ching kil@@ ns to truc@@ ks hundreds of y@@ ards away ."
"D@@ ea@@ den@@ ed by mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y and ex@@ h@@ aus@@ tion , they work sil@@ ently , doing this t@@ ask over and over for 16 or 1@@ 7 hours a day ."
"There were no brea@@ ks for food , no water brea@@ ks , and the s@@ ev@@ ere de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ conse@@ qu@@ enti@@ al ."
So per@@ vas@@ ive was the he@@ at and the d@@ ust that my cam@@ era became too ho@@ t to even tou@@ ch and ce@@ as@@ ed working .
"E@@ very 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cru@@ iser to cle@@ an out my g@@ ear and run it under an air condi@@ tion@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it , and as I s@@ at there , I thought , my cam@@ era is getting far better tre@@ at@@ ment than these people ."
"B@@ ack in the kil@@ ns , I wanted to cr@@ y , but the abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist next to me quickly gr@@ ab@@ bed me and he said , &quot; &quot; L@@ is@@ a , don &apos;t do that . J@@ ust don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very c@@ lear@@ ly expl@@ ained to me that emo@@ tional dis@@ pl@@ ays are very danger@@ ous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them ."
I couldn &apos;t off@@ er them any direc@@ t help .
"I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing ."
I wasn &apos;t a ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en of that country .
I could get them in a wor@@ se situation than they were already in .
"I &apos;d have to re@@ ly on F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves to work within the system for their liber@@ ation , and I tru@@ st@@ ed that they would ."
"As for me , I &apos;d have to w@@ ait until I got home to really feel my hear@@ t@@ brea@@ k ."
"In the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as , I found children car@@ r@@ ying st@@ one for miles down m@@ oun@@ t@@ ain@@ ous terr@@ ain to truc@@ ks w@@ ai@@ ting at ro@@ a@@ ds bel@@ ow ."
"The big sh@@ e@@ ets of sl@@ ate were he@@ av@@ ier than the children car@@ r@@ ying them , and the kids ho@@ is@@ ted them from their hea@@ ds using these hand@@ made har@@ n@@ esses of s@@ tic@@ ks and ro@@ pe and tor@@ n cl@@ ot@@ h ."
It &apos;s difficult to wit@@ ness something so over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing .
"H@@ ow can we aff@@ ect something so in@@ si@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ vas@@ ive ?"
"S@@ ome don &apos;t even know they &apos;re en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed , people working 16 , 1@@ 7 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives ."
They have nothing to comp@@ are it to .
"When these vill@@ ag@@ ers cl@@ aim@@ ed their fre@@ e@@ dom , the sl@@ av@@ e@@ hol@@ ders bur@@ ned down all of their hou@@ ses ."
"I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so pe@@ tri@@ fi@@ ed , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the c@@ enter r@@ al@@ li@@ ed for them to pers@@ ev@@ ere , and abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ists on the ground hel@@ ped them get a qu@@ arr@@ y lea@@ se of their own , so that now they do the same back@@ -@@ brea@@ king work , but they do it for themselves , and they get p@@ aid for it , and they do it in fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"S@@ e@@ x tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word sl@@ av@@ ery , and because of this wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work s@@ af@@ ely within this particular indus@@ try ."
"In K@@ ath@@ man@@ du , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had pre@@ vi@@ ously been se@@ x sl@@ aves themselves ."
"They us@@ her@@ ed me down a n@@ ar@@ row set of st@@ ai@@ rs that led to this dir@@ ty , di@@ m@@ ly flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent l@@ it bas@@ ement ."
"This wasn &apos;t a bro@@ the@@ l , per se ."
It was more like a rest@@ aur@@ ant .
"C@@ ab@@ in rest@@ aur@@ ants , as they &apos;re known in the tra@@ de , are ven@@ ues for forc@@ ed pro@@ stitu@@ tion ."
"E@@ ach has small , priv@@ ate ro@@ oms , where the sl@@ aves , women , along with young gir@@ ls and bo@@ ys , some as young as seven years old , are forc@@ ed to ent@@ ert@@ ain the cli@@ ents , encour@@ ag@@ ing them to buy more food and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ."
"E@@ ach cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le is dar@@ k and d@@ ing@@ y , identi@@ fi@@ ed with a pain@@ ted number on the w@@ all , and parti@@ tion@@ ed by pl@@ y@@ w@@ ood and a cur@@ t@@ ain ."
The wor@@ kers here often end@@ ure tr@@ ag@@ ic sex@@ u@@ al ab@@ use at the hands of their cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers .
"S@@ t@@ anding in the n@@ ear dar@@ k@@ ness , I remember feeling this qu@@ ick , ho@@ t fear , and in that inst@@ ant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be tr@@ app@@ ed in that h@@ ell ."
I had only one way out : the st@@ ai@@ rs from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back do@@ ors .
There were no win@@ do@@ ws large enough to clim@@ b through .
"These people have no es@@ cap@@ e at all , and as we take in such a difficult subj@@ ect , it &apos;s important to n@@ ote that sl@@ av@@ ery , inclu@@ ding se@@ x tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king , occu@@ rs in our own back@@ y@@ ard as well ."
"T@@ ens of hundreds of people are en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed in agricul@@ ture , in rest@@ aur@@ ants , in dom@@ es@@ tic serv@@ itu@@ de , and the l@@ ist can go on ."
"R@@ ec@@ ently , the New York T@@ im@@ es re@@ por@@ ted that between 10@@ 0,000 and 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 American children are sol@@ d into se@@ x sl@@ av@@ ery every year ."
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The tex@@ ti@@ le indus@@ try is another one we often think of when we hear about sl@@ ave lab@@ or .
I vis@@ ited vill@@ ages in India where entire famil@@ ies were en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed in the sil@@ k tra@@ de .
This is a family por@@ tr@@ ait .
"The dy@@ ed black hands are the father , while the bl@@ ue and red hands are his s@@ ons ."
"They mi@@ x dy@@ e in these big bar@@ re@@ ls , and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the sil@@ k into the li@@ qui@@ d up to their el@@ bo@@ ws , but the dy@@ e is to@@ x@@ ic ."
My inter@@ pre@@ ter told me their stories .
"&quot; &quot; We have no fre@@ e@@ dom , &quot; &quot; they said ."
"&quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get p@@ aid for our dy@@ e@@ ing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s esti@@ m@@ ated that more than 4@@ ,000 children are en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed on L@@ ake V@@ ol@@ ta , the larg@@ est man@@ -@@ made la@@ ke in the world ."
"When we first arri@@ ved , I went to have a qu@@ ick look ."
"I saw what se@@ em@@ ed to be a family f@@ ish@@ ing on a bo@@ at , two ol@@ der bro@@ thers , some youn@@ ger kids , makes sense right ?"
W@@ r@@ ong . They were all en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed .
"Ch@@ il@@ dren are taken from their famil@@ ies and tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ ked and v@@ an@@ ished , and they &apos;re forc@@ ed to work end@@ less hours on these bo@@ ats on the la@@ ke , even though they do not know how to s@@ wi@@ m ."
This young child is eight years old .
"He was t@@ rem@@ bl@@ ing when our bo@@ at appro@@ ach@@ ed , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed it would run over his tiny can@@ o@@ e ."
He was pe@@ tri@@ fi@@ ed he would be kno@@ c@@ ked in the water .
"The sk@@ el@@ et@@ al t@@ ree lim@@ b@@ s sub@@ mer@@ g@@ ed in L@@ ake V@@ ol@@ ta often cat@@ ch the f@@ ish@@ ing ne@@ ts , and w@@ ear@@ y , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed children are thro@@ wn into the water to un@@ te@@ ther the l@@ ines ."
M@@ any of them dro@@ wn .
"For as long as he can rec@@ all , he &apos;s been forc@@ ed to work on the la@@ ke ."
"T@@ er@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed of his mas@@ ter , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been tre@@ ated with cru@@ el@@ ty all his life , he pas@@ ses that down to the youn@@ ger sl@@ aves that he man@@ ages ."
"I met these bo@@ ys at five in the morning , when they were hau@@ ling in the last of their ne@@ ts , but they had been working since 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
"@@ in the c@@ old , win@@ dy night ."
And it &apos;s important to n@@ ote that these ne@@ ts we@@ igh more than a thou@@ sand pou@@ nds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to intro@@ du@@ ce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was res@@ cu@@ ed from a f@@ ish@@ ing village .
I met him at a sh@@ el@@ ter where F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves re@@ h@@ abil@@ it@@ ates vic@@ ti@@ ms of sl@@ av@@ ery .
"H@@ ere he &apos;s seen taking a bat@@ h at the well , pour@@ ing big b@@ uc@@ k@@ ets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , K@@ of@@ i has been re@@ un@@ ited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given to@@ ols to make a living and to keep their children sa@@ fe ."
K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of possibil@@ ity .
Wh@@ o will he become because someone took a st@@ and and made a difference in his life ?
"D@@ ri@@ ving down a ro@@ ad in G@@ h@@ ana with part@@ n@@ ers of F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves , a fel@@ low abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist on a mo@@ ped sudd@@ en@@ ly sp@@ ed up to our cru@@ iser and t@@ app@@ ed on the win@@ do@@ w ."
He told us to fol@@ low him down a dir@@ t ro@@ ad into the j@@ un@@ gle .
"A@@ t the end of the ro@@ ad , he ur@@ g@@ ed us out of the car , and told the dri@@ ver to quickly leave ."
"Th@@ en he poin@@ ted to@@ ward this bar@@ ely visible fo@@ ot@@ pat@@ h , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the pat@@ h , this is the pat@@ h . G@@ o . &quot; &quot; A@@ s we started down the pat@@ h , we p@@ us@@ h@@ ed as@@ ide the v@@ ines bloc@@ king the way , and after about an h@@ our of wal@@ king in , found that the tr@@ ail had become f@@ loo@@ ded by rec@@ ent r@@ ains , so I ho@@ is@@ ted the photo g@@ ear abo@@ ve my head as we desc@@ ended into these wat@@ ers up to my ch@@ est ."
"A@@ f@@ ter another two hours of hi@@ king , the win@@ ding tr@@ ail ab@@ ru@@ p@@ tly ended at a c@@ lear@@ ing , and before us was a mas@@ s of ho@@ les that could fit into the size of a fo@@ ot@@ ball field , and all of them were full of en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed people labor@@ ing ."
"M@@ any women had children str@@ app@@ ed to their b@@ ac@@ ks while they were p@@ ann@@ ing for g@@ old , w@@ ad@@ ing in water po@@ is@@ on@@ ed by mer@@ cur@@ y ."
Mer@@ cur@@ y is used in the extr@@ action process .
These min@@ ers are en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed in a mine sh@@ af@@ t in another part of G@@ h@@ ana .
"When they came out of the sh@@ af@@ t , they were so@@ a@@ king w@@ et from their own s@@ we@@ at ."
"I remember looking into their ti@@ red , bloo@@ d@@ sho@@ t eyes , for many of them had been under@@ ground for 7@@ 2 hours ."
"The sh@@ af@@ ts are up to 3@@ 00 feet de@@ ep , and they car@@ ry out he@@ av@@ y b@@ ag@@ s of st@@ one that later will be trans@@ por@@ ted to another area , where the st@@ one will be pou@@ n@@ ded so that they can extr@@ act the g@@ old ."
"A@@ t first gl@@ ance , the pou@@ n@@ ding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look clo@@ ser , we see some less for@@ tun@@ ate working on the fr@@ ing@@ es , and children too ."
"A@@ ll of them are vic@@ ti@@ m to in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , ill@@ ness and violence ."
"In fact , it &apos;s very lik@@ ely that this mus@@ cul@@ ar person will end up like this one here , rac@@ ked with tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ s@@ is and mer@@ cur@@ y po@@ is@@ on@@ ing in just a few years ."
"This is M@@ an@@ ur@@ u . Wh@@ en his father died , his un@@ cle tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ ked him to work with him in the min@@ es ."
"When his un@@ cle died , M@@ an@@ ur@@ u in@@ her@@ ited his un@@ cle &apos;s de@@ b@@ t , which fur@@ ther forc@@ ed him into being en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed in the min@@ es ."
"When I met him , he had been working in the min@@ es for 14 years , and the le@@ g in@@ j@@ ur@@ y that you see here is actually from a min@@ ing ac@@ cident , one so s@@ ev@@ ere doc@@ tors say his le@@ g should be am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated ."
"On top of that , M@@ an@@ ur@@ u has tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ s@@ is , yet he &apos;s still forc@@ ed to work day in and day out in that mine sh@@ af@@ t ."
"E@@ ven still , he has a dre@@ am that he will become free and become e@@ duc@@ ated with the help of local acti@@ vis@@ ts like F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves , and it &apos;s this sort of det@@ er@@ min@@ ation , in the face of un@@ imagin@@ able od@@ ds , that f@@ ills me with comple@@ te a@@ we ."
I want to sh@@ ine a light on sl@@ av@@ ery .
"When I was working in the field , I brought lots of c@@ and@@ les with me , and with the help of my inter@@ pre@@ ter , I im@@ par@@ ted to the people I was photograp@@ h@@ ing that I wanted to ill@@ um@@ in@@ ate their stories and their pl@@ ight , so when it was sa@@ fe for them , and sa@@ fe for me , I made these images ."
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
"I wanted them to know that we will be be@@ ar@@ ing wit@@ ness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives ."
"I tru@@ ly believe , if we can see one another as fel@@ low human be@@ ings , then it be@@ comes very difficult to t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate a@@ tro@@ cities like sl@@ av@@ ery ."
"These images are not of issu@@ es . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all des@@ er@@ ving of the same ri@@ ghts , dig@@ n@@ ity and resp@@ ect in their lives ."
"There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , m@@ ist@@ re@@ ated people I &apos;ve had the t@@ rem@@ end@@ ous hon@@ or of me@@ eting ."
"I hope that these images aw@@ a@@ ken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ign@@ ite a fi@@ re , and that fi@@ re will sh@@ ine a light on sl@@ av@@ ery , for without that light , the be@@ ast of bon@@ d@@ age can continue to live in the sh@@ ado@@ ws ."

The dec@@ or@@ ative use of w@@ ire in sou@@ ther@@ n Africa dat@@ es back hundreds of years .
"But mo@@ derni@@ z@@ ation actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of tel@@ e@@ phone w@@ ire ."
R@@ ural to urb@@ an mi@@ gr@@ ation me@@ ant that ne@@ w@@ found industri@@ al mater@@ i@@ als started to re@@ place har@@ d-@@ to-@@ com@@ e-@@ by natural gr@@ as@@ ses .
"So , here you can see the change from use — starting to use cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary mater@@ i@@ als ."
These pi@@ ec@@ es d@@ ate back from the &apos; 4@@ 0s to the l@@ ate &apos; 5@@ 0s .
"In the &apos; 9@@ 0s , my inter@@ est and pas@@ sion for tran@@ si@@ tional art form@@ s led me to a new form , which came from a squ@@ at@@ ter cam@@ p outside D@@ urb@@ an ."
"And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started develop@@ ing , really , and ment@@ or@@ ing them in terms of scale , in terms of the design ."
And the project so@@ on gre@@ w from five to 50 we@@ av@@ ers in about a year .
"S@@ o@@ on we had out@@ gro@@ wn the s@@ cr@@ a@@ p y@@ ards , what they could provi@@ de , so we co@@ er@@ c@@ ed a w@@ ire man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ rer to help us , and not only to suppl@@ y the mater@@ i@@ als on bo@@ b@@ b@@ ins , but to produce to our colo@@ r spec@@ i@@ fic@@ ations ."
"A@@ t the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibil@@ ity here to produce cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary produc@@ ts , away from the e@@ th@@ ni@@ c , a little bit more cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary ."
So I developed a whole r@@ ange around — m@@ ass@@ -@@ produc@@ ed r@@ ange — that obvi@@ ously f@@ it@@ ted into a much high@@ er@@ -@@ end dec@@ or market that could be ex@@ por@@ ted and also service our local market .
"We started experim@@ ent@@ ing , as you can see , in terms of sh@@ ap@@ es , form@@ s . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our p@@ et project . It &apos;s succ@@ ess@@ ful , it &apos;s been run@@ ning for 12 years . And we suppl@@ y the Con@@ ran sh@@ op@@ s , and D@@ onn@@ a K@@ ar@@ an , and so it &apos;s kind of great ."
"This is our group , our main group of we@@ av@@ ers ."
They come on a wee@@ k@@ ly bas@@ is to D@@ urb@@ an .
They all have b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts .
They &apos;ve all mo@@ ved back to the r@@ ural area where they came from .
It &apos;s a wee@@ k@@ ly tur@@ n@@ around of production .
This is the community that I origin@@ ally sho@@ wed you the sli@@ de of .
"And that &apos;s also mo@@ derni@@ zed today , and it &apos;s sup@@ port@@ ing work for 3@@ 00 we@@ av@@ ers ."
And the rest says it all .

"This will war@@ m up the sc@@ ented oil inside , and a particular sm@@ ell will be em@@ it@@ ted ."
"So during the course of the day , five different sm@@ el@@ ls are dis@@ pers@@ ed thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out that environment ."
An@@ y@@ one living in that house can tell the time just by the sm@@ ell .
You can see why I h@@ ate Chr@@ is .
One thing you have to know about me is I h@@ ate to lo@@ se .
This problem &apos;s been bu@@ gg@@ ing me for well over a dec@@ ade .
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why se@@ x is so good ."
"M@@ any years after the sol@@ ar power@@ ed c@@ loc@@ ks project , a young l@@ ad@@ y I knew sugg@@ es@@ ted maybe se@@ x is so good because of the five sen@@ ses ."
"And when she said this , I had an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any ."
"T@@ o do this , I dev@@ is@@ ed something called the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h ."
"A@@ long the y-@@ ax@@ is , you have a scale from z@@ er@@ o to 10 , and along the x@@ -@@ ax@@ is , you have , of course , the five sen@@ ses ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ time I had a mem@@ or@@ able experience in my life , I would re@@ cord it on this grap@@ h like a five sen@@ ses di@@ ary ."
"B@@ i@@ ke design@@ er : This is &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , cu@@ st@@ om bi@@ ke design@@ er ."
( M@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ le re@@ v@@ ving ) &#91; S@@ ound &#93; &#91; T@@ ou@@ ch &#93; &#91; S@@ ight &#93; &#91; S@@ m@@ ell &#93; &#91; T@@ as@@ te &#93; J@@ L : And that &apos;s how the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h works .
So here are some other resul@@ ts .
The first is for inst@@ ant no@@ od@@ les .
"Now obvi@@ ously , t@@ as@@ te and sm@@ ell are quite high , but no@@ tice sound is at three ."
"You know . ( S@@ l@@ ur@@ ps ) Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , I no longer d@@ ine with these people ."
"O@@ K , next , c@@ lu@@ b@@ b@@ ing ."
"A@@ ll right , and s@@ mo@@ king ."
"H@@ ere I found tou@@ ch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reas@@ ons is that s@@ mo@@ kers told me the sens@@ ation of hol@@ ding a ci@@ gar@@ ette and br@@ ing@@ ing it up to your li@@ ps is a big part of the s@@ mo@@ king experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of s@@ car@@ y to think how well ci@@ gar@@ ettes are design@@ ed by the man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ r@@ ers ."
"It would , of course , be a hor@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ al line along the top ."
"In fact , in the years that I ga@@ ther@@ ed data , only one experience came close to being the perf@@ ect one ."
"That is , of course , se@@ x . Gre@@ at se@@ x ."
R@@ es@@ pon@@ dents said that great se@@ x h@@ its all of the five sen@@ ses at an ex@@ tre@@ me level .
So the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory does help expl@@ ain why se@@ x is so good .
"Now in the middle of all this five sen@@ ses work , I sudd@@ en@@ ly rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed the sol@@ ar@@ -@@ power@@ ed c@@ loc@@ ks project from my y@@ ou@@ th ."
And I realized this the@@ ory also expl@@ ains why Chr@@ is &apos;s c@@ loc@@ k is so much better than mine .
"You see , my c@@ loc@@ k only foc@@ uses on si@@ ght , and a little bit of tou@@ ch ."
Here &apos;s Chr@@ is &apos;s c@@ loc@@ k .
It &apos;s the first c@@ loc@@ k ever that uses sm@@ ell to tell the time .
"In fact , in terms of the five sen@@ ses , Chr@@ is &apos;s c@@ loc@@ k is a re@@ volution ."
And that &apos;s what this the@@ ory t@@ au@@ ght me about my field .
"You see , up till now , us design@@ ers , we &apos;ve main@@ ly foc@@ used on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of tou@@ ch , which means we &apos;ve ig@@ no@@ red the other three sen@@ ses ."
Chr@@ is &apos;s c@@ loc@@ k shows us that even rais@@ ing just one of those other sen@@ ses can make for a br@@ illi@@ ant produc@@ t .
Here &apos;s three qu@@ ick ideas I came up with .
"We could call this &quot; &quot; the perf@@ um@@ ator . &quot; &quot; All right , next ."
"So I br@@ ush my te@@ et@@ h tw@@ ice a day , and what if we had a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush that t@@ as@@ tes like c@@ and@@ y , and when the t@@ as@@ te of c@@ and@@ y ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush ?"
"F@@ in@@ ally , I have a thing for the ke@@ ys on a flu@@ te or a cl@@ ar@@ in@@ et ."
"It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you pr@@ ess down on them ."
"Now , I don &apos;t play the flu@@ te or the cl@@ ar@@ in@@ et , so I decided to comb@@ ine these ke@@ ys with an in@@ stru@@ ment I do play : the tel@@ ev@@ ision rem@@ ote control ."
"Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll no@@ tice that the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these produc@@ ts but also the way they look ."
"Now , I realiz@@ e the five sen@@ ses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting ."
There &apos;s also the six emo@@ tions and that el@@ u@@ sive x@@ -@@ fac@@ tor .
M@@ ay@@ be that could be the t@@ op@@ ic of my next talk .
"@@ Un@@ til then , pl@@ ease have f@@ un using the five sen@@ ses in your own lives and your own design@@ s ."
"O@@ h , one last thing before I leave ."
And the best way to do that is with free c@@ and@@ y .
You guys ready ?
All right .

"When I was six years old , I re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed my gi@@ f@@ ts ."
My first gr@@ ade tea@@ cher had this br@@ illi@@ ant idea .
She wanted us to experience re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ing gi@@ f@@ ts but also learning the virtu@@ e of compl@@ im@@ ent@@ ing each other .
and three left .
And I was one of them .
And the compl@@ im@@ ents st@@ op@@ ped .
And the tea@@ cher was fre@@ a@@ king out .
And without the hu@@ mo@@ r .
There was nothing fun@@ n@@ y about that day .
"So that was one version of me , and I would die to av@@ o@@ id being in that situation again — to get re@@ j@@ ected in public again ."
That &apos;s one version .
Th@@ en fas@@ t-@@ forward eight years .
"B@@ ill G@@ ates came to my hom@@ et@@ own — B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , China — to spea@@ k , and I saw his message ."
I f@@ ell in love with that guy .
"I thought , w@@ ow , I know what I want to do now ."
"And I didn &apos;t make this up , I did wr@@ ite that let@@ ter ."
"And here it is — ( Laughter ) You don &apos;t have to read this through — ( Laughter ) This is also bad hand@@ wr@@ iting , but I did high@@ light some key words ."
You get the idea .
( Laughter ) So ...
that was another version of me : one who will con@@ quer the world .
"Well , then two years later , I was pres@@ ented with the opportunity to come to the United States ."
"I j@@ um@@ ped on it , because that was where B@@ ill G@@ ates li@@ ved , right ?"
( Laughter ) I thought that was the start of my entrepren@@ eur jour@@ ney .
"Th@@ en , fas@@ t-@@ forward another 14 years ."
I was 30 .
"N@@ ope , I didn &apos;t build that company ."
I didn &apos;t even start .
I was actually a mark@@ eting man@@ ager for a F@@ or@@ t@@ une 500 company .
And I felt I was st@@ uc@@ k ; I was st@@ ag@@ n@@ ant .
Why is that ?
Wh@@ ere is that 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year-@@ old who wr@@ ote that let@@ ter ?
One wanted to con@@ quer the world — make a difference — another was af@@ rai@@ d of re@@ j@@ ection .
And every time that si@@ x@@ -@@ year-@@ old won .
And this fear even pers@@ is@@ ted after I started my own company .
"When I was an entrepren@@ eur , I was pres@@ ented with an inv@@ est@@ ment opportunity , and then I was turned down ."
And that re@@ j@@ ection h@@ ur@@ t me .
It h@@ ur@@ t me so bad that I wanted to qu@@ it right there .
"But then I thought , h@@ ey , would B@@ ill G@@ ates qu@@ it after a simple inv@@ est@@ ment re@@ j@@ ection ?"
W@@ ould any succ@@ ess@@ ful entrepren@@ eur qu@@ it like that ?
No way .
And this is where it cli@@ c@@ ked for me .
"O@@ K , I can build a better company ."
I have to put him back in his place .
So this is where I went on@@ line and looked for help .
Google was my friend .
"Th@@ en I came up with a b@@ unch of &quot; &quot; ra@@ h@@ -@@ ra@@ h &quot; &quot; inspir@@ ational artic@@ les about &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t take it pers@@ on@@ ally , just over@@ come it . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o doesn &apos;t know that ?"
Th@@ en I found this we@@ b@@ site by l@@ uc@@ k .
It &apos;s called re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion@@ ther@@ ap@@ y@@ .@@ com@@ .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Re@@ j@@ ection Th@@ er@@ ap@@ y &quot; &quot; was this game invent@@ ed by this C@@ an@@ adi@@ an entrepren@@ eur .
H@@ is name is J@@ as@@ on Com@@ ely .
"And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for re@@ j@@ ection , and every day get re@@ j@@ ected at something , and then by the end , you des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ ze yourself from the pain ."
And I lo@@ ved that idea .
And so here &apos;s what I did .
This is what the blo@@ g looked like .
D@@ ay One ...
( Laughter ) B@@ or@@ row 100 dollars from a str@@ anger .
So this is where I went to where I was working .
I came do@@ w@@ n@@ st@@ ai@@ rs and I saw this big guy sitting behind a des@@ k .
He looked like a sec@@ ur@@ ity gu@@ ard .
So I just appro@@ ach@@ ed him .
"And I was just wal@@ king and that was the long@@ est walk of my life — h@@ air on the back of my nec@@ k st@@ anding up , I was s@@ we@@ ating and my heart was pou@@ n@@ ding ."
"( Laughter ) And he looked up , he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot;"
"And I just said , &quot; &quot; No ? I &apos;m sor@@ ry . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I turned around , and I just ran ."
I looked like this ki@@ d in &quot; &quot; The S@@ i@@ x@@ th S@@ en@@ se . &quot; &quot; I saw d@@ ead people .
( Laughter ) But then I saw this guy .
"You know , he wasn &apos;t that men@@ ac@@ ing ."
"He was a ch@@ u@@ b@@ by , lo@@ ve@@ able guy , and he even asked me , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; In fact , he inv@@ ited me to expl@@ ain myself ."
And I could &apos;ve said many things .
I didn &apos;t do any of that .
All I did was run .
"I felt , w@@ ow , this is like a micro@@ co@@ s@@ m of my life ."
"E@@ very time I felt the sli@@ gh@@ test re@@ j@@ ection , I would just run as fast as I could ."
And you know what ?
"The next day , no matter what happens , I &apos;m not going to run ."
I &apos;ll st@@ ay engag@@ ed .
"And by the way , I don &apos;t think they &apos;ve ever done bur@@ ger re@@ f@@ ill ."
( Laughter ) I think they &apos;re still there .
"But the life and death feeling I was feeling the first time was no longer there , just because I st@@ ay@@ ed engag@@ ed — because I didn &apos;t run ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , great , I &apos;m already learning things ."
This is where my life was turned up@@ side down .
I went to a K@@ ris@@ p@@ y K@@ re@@ me .
"I &apos;m sure they have some here , too ."
"And I went in , I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you make me dou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts that look like O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c sym@@ b@@ ols ?"
"B@@ as@@ ically , you inter@@ lin@@ k five dou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts together ... &quot; &quot; I mean there &apos;s no way they could say y@@ es , right ?"
The dou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut ma@@ ker took me so ser@@ i@@ ously .
And I was so tou@@ ched .
I just couldn &apos;t believe it .
And that video got over five million vie@@ ws on Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be .
The world couldn &apos;t believe that either .
And I became fam@@ ous .
"A lot of people started wr@@ iting em@@ ails to me and saying , &quot; &quot; What you &apos;re doing is aw@@ es@@ ome . &quot; &quot; But you know , f@@ ame and not@@ ori@@ ety did not do anything to me ."
"What I really wanted to do was learn , and to change myself ."
So I turned the rest of my 100 days of re@@ j@@ ection into this play@@ ground — into this research project .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I have this do@@ g that would di@@ g up anything I put in the back@@ y@@ ard ."
I don &apos;t want to was@@ te your flo@@ wer .
It &apos;s as if he &apos;s pu@@ tting all the dou@@ b@@ t on the flo@@ or .
P@@ eople were more lik@@ ely to say y@@ es to me .
And then I learned I could ful@@ f@@ ill my life dre@@ am ...
by as@@ king .
"This is me — you probably can &apos;t see , this is a bad picture ."
"You know , sometimes you get re@@ j@@ ected by li@@ gh@@ ting , you know ?"
"Wh@@ y ? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world , who change the way we live and the way we think , are the people who were met with initi@@ al and often viol@@ ent re@@ j@@ ec@@ tions ."
"P@@ eople like M@@ arti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r . , like M@@ ah@@ at@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i , N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ ela , or even J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ ris@@ t ."
These people did not let re@@ j@@ ection def@@ ine them .
They let their own re@@ action after re@@ j@@ ection def@@ ine themselves .
And they em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed re@@ j@@ ection .
"And we don &apos;t have to be those people to learn about re@@ j@@ ection , and in my case , re@@ j@@ ection was my cur@@ se , was my boo@@ ge@@ y@@ man ."
It has bo@@ ther@@ ed me my whole life because I was run@@ ning away from it .
Th@@ en I started em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing it .
I started tea@@ ching people how to turn re@@ j@@ ec@@ tions into oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties .
D@@ on &apos;t run .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So I gu@@ ess I was the l@@ uc@@ ky one .
My mother had 16 pre@@ gn@@ anci@@ es .
"F@@ ro@@ m 16 pre@@ gn@@ anci@@ es , five of us are ali@@ ve ."
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
I wanted to be a doc@@ tor to help women and children .
"So as a resul@@ t , my father sent me to America ."
I came to America .
"There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it ."
"So as so@@ on as I complet@@ ed my education , I brought my family to America ."
I ear@@ ned good money .
My family was here .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and sur@@ ve@@ y@@ ed and looked and looked .
He was a mul@@ la@@ h .
I was very happy . I was deli@@ gh@@ ted with the out@@ come of my work .
"@@ Ri@@ f@@ les on their sh@@ oul@@ ders , they bloc@@ ked the ro@@ ad ."
"My le@@ g was sh@@ a@@ king , and I got outside ."
"B@@ y the time I came to the off@@ ice , of course my tr@@ ain@@ ers were gone ."
"My bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard was the only one there , and my vo@@ ice was completely gone ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are the best tr@@ ain@@ ers ."
That tel@@ ls you that education transform@@ s people .
We were going every@@ where .
But you know what happened to my country .
But we want the same Afgh@@ an@@ istan we had before .
"We have one po@@ et , M@@ aw@@ l@@ ā@@ n@@ ā R@@ ū@@ m@@ ī ."
"This is where I live . I live in Ken@@ y@@ a , at the sou@@ th parts of the N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i N@@ ational Par@@ k ."
"Th@@ ose are my d@@ ad &apos;s co@@ ws at the back , and behind the co@@ ws , that &apos;s the N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i N@@ ational Par@@ k ."
"N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i N@@ ational Par@@ k is not f@@ enc@@ ed in the sou@@ th w@@ id@@ ely , which means w@@ il@@ d animals like z@@ e@@ br@@ as mi@@ gr@@ ate out of the par@@ k fre@@ ely ."
"So pre@@ dat@@ ors like lions fol@@ low them , and this is what they do ."
They k@@ ill our liv@@ es@@ to@@ ck .
"This is one of the co@@ ws which was kill@@ ed at night , and I just w@@ o@@ ke up in the morning and I found it d@@ ead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bul@@ l we had ."
"My community , the M@@ a@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from he@@ av@@ en with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much ."
So I gre@@ w up h@@ ating lions so much .
"The mor@@ ans are the w@@ arri@@ ors who prot@@ ect our community and the liv@@ es@@ to@@ ck , and they &apos;re also up@@ set about this problem ."
So they k@@ ill the lions .
It &apos;s one of the six lions which were kill@@ ed in N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i .
And I think this is why the N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i N@@ ational Par@@ k lions are few .
"So a bo@@ y , from six to n@@ ine years old , in my community is respon@@ sible for his d@@ ad &apos;s co@@ ws , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me ."
So I had to find a way of sol@@ ving this problem .
"And the first idea I got was to use fi@@ re , because I thought lions were s@@ car@@ ed of fi@@ re ."
"But I came to realiz@@ e that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even hel@@ ping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed ."
So I didn &apos;t give up . I continu@@ ed .
And a second idea I got was to use a s@@ car@@ ec@@ row .
I was trying to tr@@ ick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was st@@ anding n@@ ear the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed .
"But lions are very cl@@ ever . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the s@@ car@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he j@@ um@@ ps in and kill@@ s the animals ."
"So one night , I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed with a tor@@ ch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come ."
And I disco@@ vered that lions are af@@ rai@@ d of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
"S@@ in@@ ce I was a small bo@@ y , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took ap@@ art my mo@@ m &apos;s new radi@@ o , and that day she almost kill@@ ed me , but I learned a lot about electr@@ on@@ ics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car bat@@ ter@@ y , an in@@ dic@@ ator box . It &apos;s a small dev@@ ice found in a mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle , and it hel@@ ps mot@@ or@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . It bl@@ in@@ ks ."
"And I got a s@@ wit@@ ch where I can s@@ wit@@ ch on the li@@ ghts , on and off ."
And that &apos;s a small tor@@ ch from a bro@@ ken fl@@ ash@@ light .
So I set up everything .
"As you can see , the sol@@ ar pan@@ el ch@@ arg@@ es the bat@@ ter@@ y , and the bat@@ ter@@ y suppl@@ ies the power to the small in@@ dic@@ ator box . I call it a transform@@ er ."
And the in@@ dic@@ ator box makes the li@@ ghts fl@@ ash .
"As you can see , the bul@@ b@@ s face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from ."
And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
"The li@@ ghts fl@@ ash and tr@@ ick the lions into thinking I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed , but I was s@@ le@@ e@@ ping in my bed ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks .
"So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experi@@ enc@@ ed any problem with lions ."
And my neigh@@ bor@@ ing hom@@ es heard about this idea .
One of them was this grand@@ mother .
"She had a lot of her animals being kill@@ ed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the li@@ ghts for her ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the li@@ ghts . You can see at the back , those are the lion li@@ ghts ."
"S@@ in@@ ce now , I &apos;ve set up seven hom@@ es around my community , and they &apos;re really working ."
"And my idea is also being used now all over Ken@@ y@@ a for s@@ car@@ ing other pre@@ dat@@ ors like hy@@ en@@ as , le@@ o@@ par@@ ds , and it &apos;s also being used to sc@@ are el@@ e@@ ph@@ ants away from people &apos;s far@@ ms ."
"Because of this in@@ vention , I was l@@ uc@@ ky to get a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best scho@@ ols in Ken@@ y@@ a , B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ house Intern@@ ational S@@ cho@@ ol , and I &apos;m really exc@@ ited about this ."
My new school now is coming in and hel@@ ping by fun@@ d@@ rais@@ ing and cre@@ ating an aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess .
"I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing the li@@ ghts to the hom@@ es which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m tea@@ ching them how to put them ."
"So one year ago , I was just a bo@@ y in the sav@@ ann@@ a gr@@ ass@@ land her@@ ding my father &apos;s co@@ ws , and I used to see plan@@ es fl@@ ying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside ."
And here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plan@@ e for my first time for TED .
So my big dre@@ am is to become an air@@ cr@@ af@@ t engine@@ er and pil@@ ot when I grow up .
"I used to h@@ ate lions , but now because my in@@ vention is sav@@ ing my father &apos;s co@@ ws and the lions , we are able to st@@ ay with the lions without any conf@@ lic@@ t ."
"A@@ sh@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n . It means in my language , th@@ ank you very much ."
( Applause ) Chr@@ is An@@ der@@ son : You have no idea how exc@@ iting it is to hear a story like y@@ ou@@ rs .
So you got this sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p@@ .@@ Ri@@ ch@@ ard T@@ ur@@ ere : Y@@ ep .

"( Applause ) M@@ ay@@ a P@@ en@@ n : I &apos;ve been dra@@ wing ever since I could hold a cr@@ ay@@ on , and I &apos;ve been making anim@@ ated f@@ li@@ p books since I was three years old ."
"A@@ t that age , I also learned about what an anim@@ ator was ."
There was a program on T@@ V about j@@ ob@@ s most kids don &apos;t know about .
"When I underst@@ ood that an anim@@ ator makes the car@@ to@@ ons I saw on T@@ V , I im@@ medi@@ ately said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I want to be . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said it ment@@ ally or out l@@ oud , but that was a gre@@ at@@ ly defin@@ ing moment in my life ."
An@@ im@@ ation and art has always been my first love .
"It was my love for technology that s@@ par@@ ked the idea for &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ ici@@ ous D@@ ish@@ es . &quot; &quot; There was a virus on my computer , and I was trying to get ri@@ d of it , and all of a sudd@@ en , I just thought , what if vir@@ uses have their own little world inside the computer ?"
M@@ ay@@ be a rest@@ aur@@ ant where they me@@ et up and do vir@@ us@@ y things ?
"And th@@ us , &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ ici@@ ous D@@ ish@@ es &quot; &quot; was born ."
"A@@ t four years old , my d@@ ad sho@@ wed me how to take ap@@ art a computer and put it back together again ."
That started my love for technology .
"I built my first we@@ b@@ site myself in H@@ T@@ M@@ L , and I &apos;m learning J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt and P@@ y@@ th@@ on ."
I &apos;m also working on an anim@@ ated ser@@ ies called &quot; &quot; The P@@ oll@@ in@@ at@@ ors . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about be@@ es and other pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
"If pl@@ ants ar@@ en &apos;t pol@@ lin@@ ated by the pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors , then all cre@@ atures , inclu@@ ding ourselves , that de@@ pen@@ d on these pl@@ ants , would star@@ ve ."

I@@ de@@ as tru@@ ly are what make the world go r@@ ound .
"If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , medic@@ ine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives ."
"A@@ t eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called M@@ ay@@ a &apos;s I@@ de@@ as , and my n@@ on@@ prof@@ it , M@@ ay@@ a &apos;s I@@ de@@ as for the P@@ l@@ an@@ et ."
( Laughter ) And I make ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ end@@ ly clo@@ thing and acc@@ ess@@ ories .
"I &apos;m 1@@ 3 now , and al@@ though I started my business in 200@@ 8 , my arti@@ sti@@ c jour@@ ney started way before then ."
"I was gre@@ at@@ ly influ@@ enc@@ ed by art , and I wanted to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate it in everything I did , even my business ."
"I would find different fab@@ r@@ ics around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a s@@ car@@ f or a h@@ at , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for design@@ s ."
"I no@@ tic@@ ed when I w@@ o@@ re my cre@@ ations , people would stop me and say , &quot; W@@ ow , that &apos;s really cu@@ te . Wh@@ ere can I get one ? &quot;"
"And I thought , I can start my own business ."
Now I didn &apos;t have any business pl@@ ans at only eight years old .
I only knew I wanted to make pretty cre@@ ations that were sa@@ fe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
"My mo@@ m t@@ au@@ ght me how to se@@ w , and on my back por@@ ch , I would s@@ it and make little hea@@ d@@ ban@@ ds out of ri@@ b@@ bon , and I would wr@@ ite down the nam@@ es and the pr@@ ice of each it@@ em ."
"I started making more it@@ ems like h@@ ats , s@@ car@@ ves and b@@ ag@@ s ."
"S@@ o@@ on , my it@@ ems began sel@@ ling all over the world , and I had cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers in D@@ en@@ mar@@ k , I@@ tal@@ y , A@@ ustr@@ ali@@ a , C@@ an@@ ad@@ a and more ."
"Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like br@@ anding and mark@@ eting , st@@ aying engag@@ ed with my cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers , and seeing what sol@@ d the most and the least ."
"S@@ o@@ on , my business really started to take off ."
"Th@@ en one day , F@@ or@@ bes mag@@ az@@ ine cont@@ ac@@ ted me when I was 10 years old ."
( Laughter ) They wanted to fe@@ ature me and my company in their artic@@ le .
"Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ end@@ ly ?"
I &apos;ve had a pas@@ sion for prot@@ ec@@ ting the environment and its cre@@ atures since I was little .
My parents t@@ au@@ ght me at an early age about giving back and being a good ste@@ ward to the environment .
"I heard about how the dy@@ es in some clo@@ thing or the process of even making the it@@ ems was har@@ m@@ ful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I disco@@ vered that even after dy@@ e@@ ing has being complet@@ ed , there is a was@@ te issue that gi@@ ves a ne@@ g@@ ative impact on the environment ."
"For example , the gr@@ in@@ ding of mater@@ i@@ als , or the d@@ um@@ ping of dri@@ ed po@@ w@@ der mater@@ i@@ als ."
"These actions can pol@@ lu@@ te the air , making it to@@ x@@ ic to any@@ one or anything that in@@ h@@ ales it ."
"So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my it@@ ems had to be ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ end@@ ly , and 10 to 20 percent of the prof@@ its I made went to local and global ch@@ ari@@ ties and environ@@ mental organiz@@ ations ."
"( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new w@@ ave of entrepren@@ eurs that not only see@@ ks to have a succ@@ ess@@ ful business , but also a sust@@ ain@@ able future ."
I feel that I can me@@ et the needs of my cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers without com@@ prom@@ is@@ ing the ability of future gener@@ ations to live in a gre@@ en@@ er tom@@ or@@ row .
"We live in a big , di@@ verse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate to s@@ ave it ."
But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your hea@@ ds about the things that are happening in our world .
"It takes to get it through your hear@@ ts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when mo@@ v@@ ements are s@@ par@@ ked ."
"That is when oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties and innovation are created , and that is why ideas come to life ."
"Th@@ ank you , and p@@ ea@@ ce and bl@@ ess@@ ings ."
"( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) P@@ at M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell : So , you heard M@@ ay@@ a talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman . Wh@@ ere are they ?"
"P@@ lea@@ se , M@@ r@@ . and M@@ r@@ s@@ . P@@ en@@ n . W@@ ould you just — A@@ h !"
( Applause )
"You know , one of the inten@@ se pl@@ ea@@ su@@ res of trav@@ el and one of the deli@@ ghts of e@@ th@@ no@@ graphi@@ c research is the opportunity to live am@@ ong@@ st those who have not for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten the old ways , who still feel their past in the w@@ ind , tou@@ ch it in st@@ ones pol@@ ished by r@@ ain , t@@ as@@ te it in the b@@ it@@ ter le@@ aves of pl@@ ants ."
"J@@ ust to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still jour@@ ney be@@ y@@ ond the M@@ il@@ ky W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with me@@ an@@ ing , or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ a , the Bu@@ dd@@ his@@ ts still pur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the centr@@ al re@@ v@@ el@@ ation of an@@ thro@@ po@@ lo@@ gy , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some absolu@@ te sense , but is just one model of reality , the conse@@ qu@@ ence of one particular set of adap@@ tive cho@@ ices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it succ@@ ess@@ fully , many gener@@ ations ago ."
"And of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ atives ."
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through initi@@ ation r@@ ites .
"We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of death , so it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t sur@@ prise us that we all sing , we all d@@ ance , we all have art ."
"But what &apos;s interesting is the unique cad@@ ence of the s@@ ong , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every culture ."
"And whether it is the P@@ en@@ an in the for@@ es@@ ts of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in H@@ ai@@ ti , or the w@@ arri@@ ors in the K@@ ai@@ su@@ t des@@ ert of Nor@@ ther@@ n Ken@@ y@@ a , the C@@ ur@@ an@@ der@@ o in the m@@ oun@@ t@@ ains of the An@@ des , or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ ai in the middle of the S@@ a@@ har@@ a — this is in@@ cid@@ ent@@ ally the fel@@ low that I trav@@ el@@ ed into the des@@ ert with a mon@@ th ago — or in@@ de@@ ed a y@@ a@@ k her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ pes of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , E@@ ver@@ est , the go@@ dd@@ ess mother of the world ."
"A@@ ll of these pe@@ op@@ les te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing yourself in the Earth ."
"And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only f@@ ill you with hope ."
"Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a web of spir@@ itu@@ al life and cul@@ tural life that en@@ velop@@ s the planet , and is as important to the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the planet as in@@ de@@ ed is the biolo@@ gical web of life that you know as a bio@@ sp@@ here ."
"And you might think of this cul@@ tural web of life as being an e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here , and you might def@@ ine the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here as being the su@@ m tot@@ al of all thou@@ ghts and dre@@ ams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspir@@ ations , in@@ tu@@ i@@ tions brought into being by the human imagin@@ ation since the d@@ a@@ wn of consci@@ ous@@ ness ."
The e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here is human@@ ity &apos;s great leg@@ acy .
It &apos;s the sym@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qu@@ is@@ i@@ tive species .
"And just as the bio@@ sp@@ here has been s@@ ever@@ ely er@@ o@@ ded , so too is the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here — and , if anything , at a far gre@@ ater r@@ ate ."
"N@@ o biolo@@ g@@ ists , for example , would d@@ are sugg@@ est that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of ext@@ inc@@ tion because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most a@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic s@@ cen@@ ari@@ o in the re@@ al@@ m of biolo@@ gical di@@ versity — s@@ car@@ cel@@ y appro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most opti@@ mis@@ tic s@@ cen@@ ari@@ o in the re@@ al@@ m of cul@@ tural di@@ versity ."
"And the great in@@ dic@@ ator of that , of course , is language lo@@ ss ."
"When each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages spo@@ ken on the planet ."
"Now , a language is not just a body of vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gr@@ am@@ mati@@ c@@ al ru@@ les ."
A language is a fl@@ ash of the human spir@@ it .
It &apos;s a ve@@ hic@@ le through which the sou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
"E@@ very language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth for@@ est of the mind , a wat@@ er@@ sh@@ ed , a thought , an ec@@ o@@ system of spir@@ itu@@ al possibil@@ ities ."
"And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages , as we s@@ it here today in Mon@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of children ."
"They &apos;re no longer being t@@ au@@ ght to bab@@ ies , which means , effec@@ tiv@@ ely , un@@ less something changes , they &apos;re already d@@ ead ."
"What could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ velop@@ ed in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to spea@@ k your language , to have no way to pas@@ s on the w@@ is@@ dom of the anc@@ est@@ ors or anti@@ cip@@ ate the prom@@ ise of the children ?"
"And yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the pl@@ ight of somebody some@@ where on Earth rou@@ gh@@ ly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ri@@ es with him into the gr@@ ave the last sy@@ l@@ l@@ ables of an anci@@ ent t@@ on@@ gue ."
"And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spo@@ ke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at , let &apos;s make that language Yor@@ u@@ b@@ a . Let &apos;s make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ ese ."
Let &apos;s make it K@@ o@@ g@@ i . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll sudd@@ en@@ ly disco@@ ver what it would be like to be un@@ able to spea@@ k your own language .
"And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here , a bri@@ ef jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here , to try to beg@@ in to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost ."
"Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being ."
"T@@ ake , for example , this child of a B@@ ar@@ as@@ ana in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ ond@@ a who believe that my@@ tho@@ log@@ ically they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the e@@ ast in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red s@@ n@@ a@@ kes ."
"Now , this is a people who cogni@@ tiv@@ ely do not dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish the colo@@ r bl@@ ue from the colo@@ r green because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the for@@ est u@@ pon which the people de@@ pen@@ d ."
They have a curi@@ ous language and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called &quot; &quot; lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tic ex@@ o@@ gam@@ y : &quot; &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different language .
"And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ tho@@ log@@ ical past , yet the curi@@ ous thing is in these long hou@@ ses , where there are six or seven langu@@ ages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never hear any@@ one pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing a language ."
They simply l@@ ist@@ en and then beg@@ in to spea@@ k .
"O@@ r , one of the most fascin@@ ating tri@@ bes I ever li@@ ved with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ as@@ tern E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ace@@ fully in 19@@ 5@@ 8 ."
"In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , five mis@@ si@@ on@@ ar@@ ies at@@ temp@@ ted cont@@ act and made a cri@@ tical mis@@ take ."
"They dro@@ p@@ ped from the air 8 x 10 glo@@ ss@@ y photograp@@ h@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be fri@@ end@@ ly g@@ es@@ tures , for@@ getting that these people of the r@@ ain@@ for@@ est had never seen anything tw@@ o-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal in their lives ."
"They pic@@ ked up these photograp@@ h@@ s from the for@@ est flo@@ or , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the dev@@ il , so they spe@@ ar@@ ed the five mis@@ si@@ on@@ ar@@ ies to death ."
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just sp@@ ear out@@ si@@ ders .
They spe@@ ar@@ ed each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them spe@@ ar@@ ing each other .
"We tr@@ ac@@ ed gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gies back eight gener@@ ations , and we found two inst@@ ances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had g@@ ot@@ ten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ar@@ ed him any@@ way . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ ious knowledge of the for@@ est that was as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing ."
Th@@ e@@ ir hun@@ ters could sm@@ ell animal ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ aces and tell you what species left it behind .
"In the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , I had a really as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing as@@ sign@@ ment when I was asked by my profess@@ or at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard if I was interested in going down to H@@ ai@@ ti , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the secre@@ t soci@@ e@@ ties which were the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of D@@ u@@ val@@ ier &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ on@@ ton M@@ ac@@ ou@@ tes , and sec@@ ur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es ."
"In order to make sense out of sens@@ ation , of course , I had to understand something about this re@@ mark@@ able fai@@ th of Vo@@ dou@@ n . And Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black mag@@ ic cul@@ t ."
"On the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex met@@ ap@@ hy@@ s@@ ical wor@@ l@@ d@@ view ."
It &apos;s interesting .
"If I asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?"
"Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an@@ ity , Is@@ l@@ am , Bu@@ dd@@ his@@ m , Ju@@ d@@ ais@@ m , whatever ."
"There &apos;s always one contin@@ ent left out , the as@@ sum@@ ption being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa had no religi@@ ous beli@@ e@@ fs . Well , of course , they did and Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the dis@@ til@@ l@@ ation of these very prof@@ ound religi@@ ous ideas that came over during the tr@@ ag@@ ic D@@ i@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sl@@ av@@ ery era ."
"But , what makes Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relation@@ ship between the living and the d@@ ead ."
"So , the living give bir@@ th to the spir@@ its ."
"The spir@@ its can be in@@ vo@@ ked from bene@@ ath the Gre@@ at W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to mom@@ ent@@ ar@@ ily dis@@ place the sou@@ l of the living , so that for that bri@@ ef sh@@ in@@ ing moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te be@@ comes the go@@ d ."
That &apos;s why the Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; &quot; You white people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and spea@@ k about God .
"We d@@ ance in the temp@@ le and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are pos@@ s@@ essed , you are taken by the spir@@ it — how can you be har@@ m@@ ed ?"
"So you see these as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing dem@@ on@@ str@@ ations : Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ bers with imp@@ un@@ ity , a rather as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing dem@@ on@@ str@@ ation of the ability of the mind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ aly@@ zed in the state of ex@@ tre@@ me exc@@ itation ."
"Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordin@@ ary are the K@@ o@@ g@@ i of the S@@ i@@ er@@ ra N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a de S@@ ant@@ a Mar@@ ta in nor@@ ther@@ n C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a ."
"D@@ esc@@ end@@ ants of the anci@@ ent T@@ air@@ on@@ a civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation which once car@@ p@@ et@@ ed the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ as@@ t@@ al pl@@ ain of C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a , in the w@@ ake of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic mas@@ si@@ f that so@@ ars abo@@ ve the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ as@@ t@@ al pl@@ ain ."
"In a bloo@@ d@@ st@@ ained contin@@ ent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"T@@ o this day , they rem@@ ain r@@ ul@@ ed by a r@@ itu@@ al pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od but the tr@@ aining for the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is rather extraordin@@ ary ."
"The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their famil@@ ies at the age of three and four , se@@ ques@@ ter@@ ed in a sh@@ ado@@ w@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one hu@@ ts at the base of gl@@ ac@@ i@@ ers for 18 years : two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year per@@ i@@ o@@ ds deli@@ ber@@ ately cho@@ s@@ en to m@@ im@@ ic the n@@ ine months of g@@ est@@ ation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother ."
"And for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ ues of their society , val@@ ues that ma@@ int@@ ain the pro@@ position that their pr@@ ay@@ ers and their pr@@ ay@@ ers alone ma@@ int@@ ain the co@@ s@@ mi@@ c — or we might say the ec@@ olo@@ gical — bal@@ ance ."
"And at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they &apos;re sudd@@ en@@ ly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a su@@ n@@ r@@ ise . And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess of first light as the S@@ un beg@@ ins to b@@ a@@ the the s@@ lo@@ pes of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ingly beautiful land@@ s@@ cap@@ e , sudd@@ en@@ ly everything they have learned in the ab@@ str@@ act is aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ ory . And the pri@@ est ste@@ ps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you ."
"It is that beautiful . It is y@@ ou@@ rs to prot@@ ect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; el@@ der bro@@ thers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the youn@@ ger bro@@ thers , are the ones respon@@ sible for des@@ tro@@ ying the world ."
"Now , this level of in@@ tu@@ ition be@@ comes very important ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and land@@ s@@ cap@@ e , we either in@@ vo@@ ke R@@ ou@@ ss@@ eau and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; &quot; no@@ ble sav@@ age , &quot; &quot; which is an idea rac@@ ist in its simpl@@ ic@@ ity , or al@@ tern@@ ativ@@ ely , we in@@ vo@@ ke Th@@ ore@@ au and say these people are clo@@ ser to the Earth than we are ."
"Well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther senti@@ mental no@@ r wea@@ k@@ en@@ ed by no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a ."
"There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al s@@ w@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing win@@ ds of T@@ i@@ b@@ et , but they have , n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess , through time and r@@ itu@@ al , for@@ g@@ ed a tradi@@ tional my@@ sti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler in@@ tu@@ ition : the idea that the Earth itself can only ex@@ ist because it is bre@@ ath@@ ed into being by human consci@@ ous@@ ness ."
"Now , what does that mean ?"
It means that a young ki@@ d from the An@@ des who &apos;s rais@@ ed to believe that that m@@ oun@@ t@@ ain is an A@@ pu spir@@ it that will direc@@ t his or her des@@ tiny will be a prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly different human being and have a different relation@@ ship to that res@@ our@@ ce or that place than a young ki@@ d from Mon@@ t@@ ana rais@@ ed to believe that a m@@ oun@@ t@@ ain is a pi@@ le of ro@@ ck ready to be min@@ ed .
Wh@@ e@@ ther it &apos;s the ab@@ ode of a spir@@ it or a pi@@ le of o@@ re is ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or that defin@@ es the relation@@ ship between the individual and the natural world .
I was rais@@ ed in the for@@ es@@ ts of B@@ ri@@ tis@@ h C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those for@@ es@@ ts ex@@ is@@ ted to be cut .
"That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ ong@@ st the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those for@@ es@@ ts were the ab@@ ode of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked B@@ ea@@ k of H@@ e@@ av@@ en and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spir@@ its that d@@ w@@ ell@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the world , spir@@ its they would have to eng@@ age during their H@@ am@@ at@@ sa initi@@ ation ."
"Now , if you beg@@ in to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different re@@ ali@@ ties , you could beg@@ in to understand some of their extraordin@@ ary disco@@ ver@@ ies . T@@ ake this pl@@ ant here ."
It &apos;s a photograp@@ h I took in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pr@@ il .
"This is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active pre@@ par@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ ire ."
"What makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a fascin@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er ph@@ arm@@ ac@@ olo@@ gical potenti@@ al of this pre@@ par@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sour@@ ces : on the one hand , this w@@ oo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a ser@@ ies of bet@@ a-@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ d@@ ly h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic — to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of bl@@ ue h@@ az@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consci@@ ous@@ ness — but it &apos;s mi@@ x@@ ed with the le@@ aves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ ee family called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ dis ."
"This pl@@ ant had in it some very powerful tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine ."
"If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ ses , that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different set of species also cont@@ ains me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine ."
T@@ o have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your no@@ se is rather like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que pain@@ t@@ ings and l@@ anding on a se@@ a of electr@@ ic@@ ity . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the dist@@ or@@ tion of reality ; it cre@@ ates the dis@@ solution of reality .
"In fact , I used to ar@@ gue with my profess@@ or , Ri@@ ch@@ ard E@@ v@@ an Sh@@ ul@@ tes — who is a man who s@@ par@@ ked the psy@@ ch@@ ed@@ el@@ ic era with his disco@@ very of the mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s — I used to ar@@ gue that you couldn &apos;t clas@@ si@@ f@@ y these tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ines as h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the eff@@ ects there &apos;s no one home any@@ more to experience a h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ation . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ atu@@ red by an en@@ z@@ y@@ me found nat@@ ur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine ox@@ id@@ ase ."
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other chem@@ ical that den@@ atures the M@@ A@@ O .
"Now , the fascin@@ ating things are that the bet@@ a-@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ors of the pre@@ c@@ ise sort nec@@ ess@@ ary to potenti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine . So you ask yourself a question ."
"H@@ ow , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of vas@@ cul@@ ar pl@@ ants , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ olo@@ g@@ ically un@@ rel@@ ated pl@@ ants that when combin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chem@@ ical version of the whole being gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the parts ?"
"Well , we use that great eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism , &quot; &quot; tri@@ al and er@@ ro@@ r , &quot; &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be me@@ an@@ ing@@ less ."
"But you ask the In@@ di@@ ans , and they say , &quot; &quot; The pl@@ ants talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?"
"This tri@@ be , the C@@ of@@ an , has 1@@ 7 vari@@ e@@ ties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a , all of which they dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish a great dist@@ ance in the for@@ est , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our ey@@ e as one species ."
"And then you ask them how they est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish their ta@@ x@@ onom@@ y and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about pl@@ ants ."
"I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 vari@@ e@@ ties in the night of a full mo@@ on , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key ."
"Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ ens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the pl@@ ight of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ ain@@ t and col@@ or@@ ful but some@@ how re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , me@@ an@@ ing our world , mo@@ ves on ."
"Well , the tru@@ th is the 20@@ th century , 3@@ 00 years from now , is not going to be rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed for its w@@ ars or its technolo@@ gical innov@@ ations , but rather as the era in which we sto@@ od by and either activ@@ ely end@@ ors@@ ed or pas@@ si@@ v@@ ely accep@@ ted the mas@@ sive des@@ truc@@ tion of both biolo@@ gical and cul@@ tural di@@ versity on the planet .

All cul@@ tures through all time have const@@ antly been engag@@ ed in a d@@ ance with new possibil@@ ities of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The S@@ i@@ ou@@ x In@@ di@@ ans did not stop being S@@ i@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the b@@ ow and ar@@ row any more than an American st@@ op@@ ped being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ g@@ gy .
"It &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the in@@ te@@ gr@@ ity of the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here . It is power , the cru@@ de face of dom@@ in@@ ation ."

And you cannot understand the pain of T@@ i@@ b@@ et until you move through it at the ground level .
"I once trav@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 miles from Ch@@ eng@@ du in W@@ es@@ tern China over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ as@@ tern T@@ i@@ b@@ et to L@@ h@@ as@@ a with a young colle@@ ag@@ ue , and it was only when I got to L@@ h@@ as@@ a that I underst@@ ood the face behind the st@@ atis@@ tics you hear about : 6@@ ,000 sac@@ red mon@@ uments tor@@ n ap@@ art to d@@ ust and ash@@ es , 1@@ .@@ 2 million people kill@@ ed by the cad@@ res during the C@@ ul@@ tural R@@ evol@@ ution ."
This young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ ama .

H@@ is mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the cri@@ me of being we@@ al@@ thy .
He was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed into the j@@ ail at the age of two to hi@@ de bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t t@@ ails because she couldn &apos;t b@@ ear to be without him .

"One day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently st@@ ep@@ ped on an arm@@ b@@ and of M@@ a@@ o , and for that trans@@ gr@@ ession , she was given seven years of hard lab@@ or ."
"The pain of T@@ i@@ b@@ et can be impossible to b@@ ear , but the re@@ d@@ emp@@ tive spir@@ it of the people is something to beh@@ old ."

This is a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten we design@@ ed in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten to be a cir@@ cle .
It &apos;s a kind of end@@ less cir@@ cul@@ ation on top of the ro@@ of .
"If you are a par@@ ent , you know that kids love to keep making cir@@ cles ."
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we design this ?
"The princip@@ al of this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a hand@@ rai@@ l . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; But he ins@@ is@@ ted : &quot; &quot; How about having a n@@ et s@@ tic@@ king out from the ed@@ ge of the ro@@ of ?"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es po@@ p@@ ping through .
And we were al@@ lowed to call this ro@@ pe as a hand@@ rai@@ l .
"But of course , ro@@ pe has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the n@@ et .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times 40 children are around a t@@ ree .
"The bo@@ y on the br@@ an@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the t@@ ree so he is e@@ ating the t@@ ree ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they s@@ it on the ed@@ ge ."
It looks so ni@@ ce from under@@ ne@@ ath .
Mon@@ ke@@ ys in the z@@ o@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ e@@ ding time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g was@@ h@@ ing place — there are many kinds of water t@@ ap@@ s .
"You see with the fl@@ ex@@ i@@ ble tu@@ bes , you want to s@@ pr@@ ay water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in front is quite normal ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not was@@ h@@ ing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s pu@@ tting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this architecture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ oms .
So there is no ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ c b@@ arri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qui@@ et box , some of them get really ner@@ vous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ vous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary .
"And the princip@@ al says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to st@@ ay in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back even@@ tually , because it &apos;s a cir@@ cle , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of oc@@ cas@@ ion , usu@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ d@@ ly , we consi@@ der no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qui@@ et space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , these children show amazing concentr@@ ation in clas@@ s ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the j@@ un@@ gle with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not sup@@ posed to be in sil@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control ."
And you should know that we can go s@@ ki@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in win@@ ter .
In sum@@ mer you go s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing .
The sand is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
"And also , you should know that you are wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of ."
You never m@@ el@@ t in r@@ ain .
"So , children are sup@@ posed to be outside ."
So that is how we should tre@@ at them .
This is how they di@@ vi@@ de cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ oms .
They are sup@@ posed to help tea@@ chers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A cl@@ ass@@ room .
And a was@@ h@@ bas@@ in .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the cl@@ ass@@ room .
A mon@@ key trying to fish another mon@@ key from abo@@ ve .
( Laughter ) Mon@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each cl@@ ass@@ room has at least one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ ant@@ a C@@ l@@ au@@ s comes down at the time of Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ sh@@ ap@@ ed kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten ."
The building is only five met@@ ers t@@ all with seven flo@@ ors .
"And of course , the ce@@ il@@ ing he@@ ight is very low ."
So you have to consi@@ der s@@ af@@ ety .
"So , we put our children , a d@@ aughter and a son ."
They tried to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s o@@ kay . H@@ is sk@@ ul@@ l is quite str@@ ong .
He is res@@ il@@ ient . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to j@@ um@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ ff@@ ic j@@ am is aw@@ ful in T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in front , she needs to learn how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now these days , kids need a small do@@ s@@ age of d@@ anger ."
"And in this kind of oc@@ cas@@ ion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are lo@@ sing these days .
"Now , this dra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the mo@@ vement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
And the cir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence of this building is 18@@ 3 met@@ ers .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 met@@ ers in the morning ."
But the sur@@ prise is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 met@@ ers on average ."
And these children have the high@@ est ath@@ le@@ tic abil@@ ities am@@ ong many kin@@ der@@ gar@@ t@@ ens .
"The princip@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t train them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
J@@ ust like sh@@ e@@ ep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep run@@ ning . ( Laughter )
"My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t prot@@ ect them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble sometimes ."
They need to get some in@@ j@@ ur@@ y .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
"I think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people &apos;s lives ."
And this is one of the at@@ temp@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .

Here are some images of c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers of galax@@ ies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
"They are these huge collec@@ tions of galax@@ ies , b@@ ound together by their mu@@ tu@@ al grav@@ ity ."
"So most of the points that you see on the scre@@ en are not individual star@@ s , but collec@@ tions of star@@ s , or galax@@ ies ."
"Now , by sho@@ wing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that galax@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers are these beautiful obj@@ ects , but more than that , I think galax@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers are my@@ st@@ er@@ ious , they are sur@@ pris@@ ing , and they &apos;re us@@ e@@ ful ."
U@@ se@@ ful as the universe &apos;s most mas@@ sive labor@@ at@@ ories .
"And as labor@@ at@@ ories , to descri@@ be galax@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers is to descri@@ be the experim@@ ents that you can do with them ."
"And I think there are four maj@@ or types , and the first type that I want to descri@@ be is prob@@ ing the very big ."
"So , how big ?"
"Well , here is an image of a particular galax@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ er ."
"It is so mas@@ sive that the light pass@@ ing through it is being b@@ ent , it &apos;s being dist@@ or@@ ted by the ex@@ tre@@ me grav@@ ity of this c@@ lu@@ st@@ er ."
"And , in fact , if you look very care@@ fully you &apos;ll be able to see r@@ ings around this c@@ lu@@ st@@ er ."
"Now , to give you a number , this particular galax@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ er has a mas@@ s of over one million billion su@@ ns ."
It &apos;s just min@@ d-@@ bo@@ g@@ gl@@ ing how mas@@ sive these systems can get .
"But more than their mas@@ s , they have this ad@@ di@@ tional fe@@ ature ."
"They are essenti@@ ally is@@ ol@@ ated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down version of the entire universe ."
"And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large sc@@ ales , such as , how does grav@@ ity work ?"
might be ans@@ wer@@ ed by stu@@ d@@ ying these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very ho@@ t .
"O@@ kay , if I take an image of a galax@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ er , and I sub@@ tr@@ act away all of the star@@ light , what I &apos;m left with is this big , bl@@ ue blo@@ b ."
This is in f@@ al@@ se colo@@ r .
It &apos;s actually X@@ -@@ r@@ ay light that we &apos;re seeing .
"And the question is , if it &apos;s not galax@@ ies , what is em@@ itting this light ?"
"The answer is ho@@ t g@@ as , milli@@ on-@@ de@@ gre@@ e g@@ as — in fact , it &apos;s plas@@ ma ."
And the reason why it &apos;s so ho@@ t goes back to the pre@@ vi@@ ous sli@@ de .
"The ex@@ tre@@ me grav@@ ity of these systems is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating parti@@ cles of g@@ as to great spe@@ e@@ ds , and great spe@@ e@@ ds means great tem@@ per@@ atures ."
"So this is the main idea , but science is a r@@ ough dra@@ ft ."
"There are many bas@@ ic pro@@ per@@ ties about this plas@@ ma that still con@@ fu@@ se us , still pu@@ z@@ z@@ le us , and still p@@ ush our understanding of the phys@@ ics of the very ho@@ t ."
Th@@ ird thing : prob@@ ing the very small .
"Now , to expl@@ ain this , I need to tell you a very dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing fact ."
Mo@@ st of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of at@@ oms .
You were li@@ ed to .
"M@@ o@@ st of it is made up of something very , very my@@ st@@ er@@ ious , which we call dar@@ k matter ."
"D@@ ar@@ k matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to inter@@ act very much , excep@@ t through grav@@ ity , and of course we would like to learn more about it ."
"If you &apos;re a parti@@ cle phys@@ ic@@ ist , you want to know what happens when we sm@@ ash things together ."
And dar@@ k matter is no excep@@ tion .
"Well , how do we do this ?"
"T@@ o answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galax@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers col@@ li@@ de ?"
Here is an image .
"S@@ in@@ ce galax@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers are repres@@ ent@@ ative sli@@ ces of the universe , sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sions ."
"They are mo@@ st@@ ly made up of dar@@ k matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this bl@@ u@@ ish pur@@ ple ."
"The red repres@@ ents the ho@@ t g@@ as , and , of course , you can see many galax@@ ies ."
"What &apos;s happened is a parti@@ cle ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ator at a huge , huge scale ."
"And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small eff@@ ects that might be difficult to det@@ ect in the la@@ b , might be com@@ pou@@ n@@ ded and com@@ pou@@ n@@ ded into something that we could possi@@ bly obser@@ ve in nature ."
"So , it &apos;s very fun@@ n@@ y ."
F@@ our@@ th thing : the phys@@ ics of the very str@@ ange .
C@@ ert@@ ain@@ ly what I &apos;ve said so far is cr@@ az@@ y .
"O@@ kay , if there &apos;s anything str@@ anger I think it has to be dar@@ k energy ."
"If I thro@@ w a ball into the air , I exp@@ ect it to go up ."
What I don &apos;t exp@@ ect is that it go up at an ever@@ -@@ increas@@ ing r@@ ate .
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , co@@ s@@ mo@@ log@@ ists understand why the universe is exp@@ anding ."
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s exp@@ anding at an ever@@ -@@ increas@@ ing r@@ ate .
"They give the cause of this ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated exp@@ an@@ sion a name , and they call it dar@@ k energy ."
"And , again , we want to learn more about it ."
"So , one particular question that we have is , how does dar@@ k energy aff@@ ect the universe at the larg@@ est sc@@ ales ?"
"D@@ e@@ pend@@ ing on how str@@ ong it is , maybe structure form@@ s fas@@ ter or s@@ lo@@ wer ."
"Well , the problem with the lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ bly compl@@ ic@@ ated ."
Here is a computer simul@@ ation .
And we need a way to simpl@@ i@@ f@@ y it .
"Well , I like to think about this using an an@@ alo@@ gy ."
"If I want to understand the sin@@ king of the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little posi@@ tions of every single little piece of the bo@@ at that bro@@ ke off ."
The most important thing to do is to tr@@ ack the two bigg@@ est parts .
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the larg@@ est sc@@ ales by tr@@ ac@@ king its bigg@@ est pi@@ ec@@ es and those bigg@@ est pi@@ ec@@ es are c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers of galax@@ ies ."
"So , as I come to a close , you might feel sli@@ gh@@ tly che@@ ated ."
"I mean , I began by talking about how galax@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers are us@@ e@@ ful , and I &apos;ve given some reas@@ ons , but what is their use really ?"
"Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quot@@ e by H@@ en@@ ry F@@ or@@ d when he was asked about cars ."
"He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said fas@@ ter hor@@ ses . &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day , we as a society are fac@@ ed with many , many difficult problems ."
And the solutions to these problems are not obvi@@ ous .
They are not fas@@ ter hor@@ ses .
They will re@@ qu@@ ire an en@@ orm@@ ous amount of scientifi@@ c in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity .
"So , y@@ es , we need to foc@@ us , y@@ es , we need to concentr@@ ate , but we also need to remember that innovation , in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity , inspir@@ ation — these things come when we bro@@ ad@@ en our field of vision when we step back when we z@@ o@@ om out ."
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by stu@@ d@@ ying the universe around us . Th@@ an@@ ks .

"( D@@ r@@ um@@ s ) I &apos;m a single white ma@@ le , 4@@ 5 years of age ."
I love animals .
G@@ ain@@ fully employ@@ ed .
I &apos;m a people person .
I keep fit .
Wh@@ o am I looking for ?
I &apos;m looking for my idea m@@ ate .
A@@ re you that idea that mat@@ ches with who I really am ?
( V@@ ide@@ o ) R@@ on F@@ in@@ ley : How would you feel if you had no access to heal@@ thy food ?
G@@ ar@@ den@@ ing is the most ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic and de@@ fi@@ ant act you can do .
"R@@ W : W@@ ow , we sure are getting our fin@@ g@@ ers dir@@ ty for a first d@@ ate , hu@@ h ?"
"R@@ W : I love words , too — just as much as any l@@ ex@@ i-@@ ta@@ -@@ to@@ grap@@ her ."
"What if you love a word that you &apos;ve just made up , like — I don &apos;t know — &quot; &quot; s@@ cu@@ ber@@ fin@@ k@@ les &quot; &quot; ?"
B@@ eau L@@ ot@@ to : D@@ o you think you see reality ?
"R@@ W : Well , I &apos;m a little ne@@ ar@@ si@@ gh@@ ted , but y@@ eah ."
"B@@ L : Well , you can &apos;t — I mean , your brain has no access to this world ."
"In fact , even the sen@@ sor@@ y information that your eyes are re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ing , your ear@@ s are re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ing , is completely me@@ an@@ ing@@ less because it could mean anything ."
R@@ W : I &apos;m just curi@@ ous : D@@ o we have any conf@@ lic@@ t that needs man@@ ag@@ ing or social issu@@ es to res@@ ol@@ ve ?
"I@@ B@@ I : R@@ em@@ ember — you &apos;re on a d@@ ate with my idea , not me ."
You &apos;re not making the face .
You &apos;re making the &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not good at life &quot; &quot; face .
I am seeing other ideas . OK ?
I &apos;m d@@ ating around .
"@@ 3@@ .@@ 1@@ 4@@ 1@@ 5@@ 9@@ 2@@ 6@@ 5@@ 3@@ 5@@ 8@@ 9@@ 7@@ 9 — Re@@ g@@ gie W@@ at@@ ts : If we &apos;re going to do something , we &apos;ve got to just make a dec@@ ision ."
Because without a dec@@ ision we &apos;re left power@@ less .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ out power , we have nothing to suppl@@ y the ch@@ ain of those who are tru@@ ly curi@@ ous to sol@@ ve all of our cur@@ rent conditions ."
J@@ M : Yes !
"R@@ W : So , are we going D@@ u@@ t@@ ch ?"
9@@ 7@@ 1 ?
I@@ B@@ I : B@@ on@@ o@@ bo@@ s ! ( L@@ augh@@ s ) B@@ on@@ o@@ bo@@ s .
"R@@ W@@ at@@ ts : U@@ m , interested much ?"
R@@ W : I want to have your idea bab@@ y .
"R@@ W@@ at@@ ts : Well , you know what they say in R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
R@@ W : H@@ m ?
"T@@ en years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life ."
"A@@ t the time , I was car@@ di@@ olo@@ g@@ ist at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , spec@@ i@@ aliz@@ ing in car@@ di@@ a@@ c imag@@ ing techni@@ ques ."
The call came from a v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ an at the L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es Z@@ o@@ o .
A@@ n el@@ der@@ ly fem@@ ale ch@@ imp@@ anz@@ ee had w@@ o@@ ken up with a fac@@ ial dro@@ op and the v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were wor@@ ried that she &apos;d had a str@@ o@@ ke .
They asked if I &apos;d come to the z@@ o@@ o and image the animal &apos;s heart to look for a possible car@@ di@@ a@@ c cause .
"And oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally , on the very same day , I went on r@@ oun@@ ds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A M@@ e@@ dic@@ al C@@ enter and at the L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es Z@@ o@@ o ."
And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear foc@@ us for me .
"Now , I &apos;ve got a conf@@ ession to make ."
"E@@ ven though I stu@@ died compar@@ ative phy@@ si@@ olo@@ gy and evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary biolo@@ gy as an under@@ gr@@ ad — I had even wr@@ it@@ ten my sen@@ i@@ or th@@ es@@ is on D@@ ar@@ win@@ ian the@@ ory — learning about the signific@@ ant over@@ la@@ p between the dis@@ or@@ ders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed w@@ a@@ ke@@ -@@ up call for me ."
"So I started wonder@@ ing , with all of these over@@ l@@ ap@@ s , how was it that I had never thought to ask a v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ an , or con@@ sul@@ t the v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ary liter@@ ature , for in@@ si@@ ghts into one of my human patients ?"
"I mean , look , every single phys@@ ici@@ an accep@@ ts some biolo@@ gical conn@@ ection between animals and humans ."
"Now , maybe some of the sur@@ prise comes from the increas@@ ing se@@ par@@ ation in our world between the urb@@ an and the n@@ on@@ urb@@ an ."
"You know , we hear about these city kids who think that w@@ o@@ ol gro@@ ws on tre@@ es or that che@@ ese comes from a pl@@ ant ."
But I think there &apos;s an even de@@ e@@ per reason .
"P@@ hy@@ s@@ ici@@ ans and scientists , we accep@@ t int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tually that our species , H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , is mer@@ ely one species , no more unique or spec@@ ial than any other ."
"But in our hear@@ ts , we don &apos;t completely believe that ."
I feel it myself when I &apos;m lis@@ ten@@ ing to Mo@@ z@@ art or looking at pic@@ tures of the Mars R@@ over on my M@@ ac@@ Bo@@ ok .
"I feel that tu@@ g of human excep@@ tion@@ alis@@ m , even as I recogni@@ ze the scienti@@ fic@@ ally is@@ ol@@ ating cost of seeing ourselves as a super@@ i@@ or species , ap@@ art ."
"Well , I &apos;m trying these days ."
"And , might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient ?"
Here are a few exam@@ ples of the kind of exc@@ iting connec@@ tions that this kind of thinking has led me to .
F@@ ear@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed heart fai@@ lu@@ re .
"But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagno@@ s@@ is was ne@@ i@@ ther new , no@@ r was it uni@@ quel@@ y human ."
"@@ V@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans had been diagno@@ sing , tre@@ ating and even pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing emo@@ tion@@ ally in@@ duc@@ ed sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms in animals r@@ ang@@ ing from mon@@ ke@@ ys to fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , from to de@@ er to r@@ ab@@ b@@ its , since the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
How many human lives might have been sav@@ ed if this v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ary knowledge had been put into the hands of E@@ .@@ R@@ . doc@@ s and car@@ di@@ olo@@ g@@ ists ?
S@@ el@@ f-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ y .
S@@ ome human patients har@@ m themselves .
"S@@ ome pl@@ uc@@ k out pat@@ ches of h@@ air , others actually cut themselves ."
S@@ ome animal patients also har@@ m themselves .
There are bir@@ ds that pl@@ uc@@ k out f@@ ea@@ thers .
There are st@@ al@@ lions that re@@ peti@@ tiv@@ ely b@@ ite their fl@@ an@@ ks until they b@@ le@@ ed .
But v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have very spec@@ ifi@@ c and very effec@@ tive ways of tre@@ ating and even pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing self-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ y in their self-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ ing animals .
Sh@@ ouldn &apos;t this v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ary knowledge be put into the hands of psycho@@ ther@@ ap@@ ists and parents and patients stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with self-@@ in@@ j@@ ur@@ y ?
P@@ o@@ st@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pression and pos@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m psycho@@ s@@ is .
"S@@ ome@@ times , so@@ on after giving bir@@ th , some women become de@@ pr@@ essed , and sometimes they become ser@@ i@@ ously de@@ pr@@ essed and even psycho@@ tic ."
"They may ne@@ gl@@ ect their ne@@ w@@ born , and in some ex@@ tre@@ me cas@@ es , even har@@ m the child ."
"E@@ qu@@ ine v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans also know that oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally , a ma@@ re , so@@ on after giving bir@@ th , will ne@@ gl@@ ect the fo@@ al , re@@ f@@ using to n@@ ur@@ se , and in some inst@@ ances , k@@ ick the fo@@ al , even to death ."
But v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have dev@@ is@@ ed an inter@@ vention to deal with this fo@@ al re@@ j@@ ection syn@@ dr@@ ome that invol@@ ves increas@@ ing oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in in the ma@@ re .
"O@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in is the bon@@ ding hor@@ m@@ one , and this lea@@ ds to ren@@ e@@ wed inter@@ est , on the part of the ma@@ re , in her fo@@ al ."
Sh@@ ouldn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of o@@ b / gy@@ n &apos;s and family doc@@ tors and patients who are stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with pos@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pression and psycho@@ s@@ is ?
"Well , des@@ p@@ ite all of this prom@@ ise , un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely the g@@ ul@@ f between our fiel@@ ds re@@ mains large ."
"T@@ o expl@@ ain it , I &apos;m af@@ rai@@ d I &apos;m going to have to air some dir@@ ty l@@ aun@@ dr@@ y ."
S@@ ome phys@@ ici@@ ans can be real s@@ no@@ b@@ s about doc@@ tors who are not M@@ .@@ D@@ . &apos; s .
"I &apos;m talking about d@@ enti@@ sts and op@@ t@@ ome@@ tr@@ ists and psycho@@ log@@ ists , but maybe esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally animal doc@@ tors ."
"O@@ f course , most phys@@ ici@@ ans don &apos;t realiz@@ e that it is har@@ der to get into v@@ et school these days than medic@@ al school , and that when we go to medic@@ al school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , but v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ ans need to learn about health and disease in mam@@ m@@ als , am@@ ph@@ i@@ bi@@ ans , re@@ p@@ ti@@ les , fish and bir@@ ds ."
So I don &apos;t bl@@ ame the v@@ ets for feeling an@@ no@@ y@@ ed by my prof@@ ession &apos;s con@@ des@@ cen@@ sion and ign@@ or@@ ance .
But here &apos;s one from the v@@ ets : What do you call a v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ari@@ an who can only take care of one species ?
"And through Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity con@@ fer@@ ences , where we bring medic@@ al scho@@ ols together with v@@ et@@ er@@ in@@ ary scho@@ ols for collabor@@ tive discus@@ sions of the shar@@ ed dis@@ eas@@ es and dis@@ or@@ ders of animal and human patients ."
"And one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by p@@ aying close attention to how all the other patients on the planet live , grow , get s@@ ick and he@@ al ."
Thank you .
C@@ an ge@@ ograp@@ hi@@ c information make you heal@@ thy ?
In 200@@ 1 I got h@@ it by a train .
My train was a heart att@@ ack .
"I found myself in a hosp@@ ital in an inten@@ si@@ ve@@ -@@ care ward , re@@ cu@@ per@@ ating from emer@@ gen@@ cy sur@@ g@@ ery ."
And I sudd@@ en@@ ly realized something : that I was completely in the dar@@ k .
"I started as@@ king my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;"
&quot; C@@ ould my doc@@ tor have war@@ ned me ? &quot;
"So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the form@@ u@@ la for life and good health ."
"@@ G@@ en@@ e@@ tics , li@@ f@@ es@@ ty@@ le and environment ."
"That &apos;s going to sort of cont@@ ain our ris@@ ks , and if we man@@ age those ris@@ ks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good heal@@ thy life ."
"Well , I understand the gen@@ e@@ tics and li@@ f@@ es@@ ty@@ le part ."
And you know why I understand that ?
Because my phys@@ ici@@ ans const@@ antly ask me questions about this .
"H@@ ave you ever had to f@@ ill out those long , le@@ gal@@ -@@ size form@@ s in your doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice ?"
"I mean , if you &apos;re l@@ uc@@ ky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?"
"( Laughter ) D@@ o it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your li@@ f@@ es@@ ty@@ le and your family history , your medic@@ ation history , your sur@@ gical history , your all@@ er@@ gy history ... did I for@@ get any history ?"
"But this part of the equ@@ ation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my phys@@ ici@@ ans really get this part of the equ@@ ation ."
"What does that mean , my environment ?"
"Well , it can mean a lot of things ."
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
Wh@@ ile I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you li@@ ved ?
"J@@ ust think about that , you know , w@@ and@@ er through your life thinking about this ."
And you realiz@@ e that you spend it in a vari@@ ety of different places .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
"And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an air@@ plan@@ e a good por@@ tion of your time trav@@ eling some place ."
"So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody as@@ ks you , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?"
"And where do you ex@@ pose y@@ ourselves to ris@@ ks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclu@@ sion that I spend about 7@@ 5 percent of my time rel@@ ativ@@ ely in a small number of places ."
"And I don &apos;t w@@ and@@ er far from that place for a major@@ ity of my time , even though I &apos;m an ex@@ ten@@ sive global tre@@ k@@ ker ."
"Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little jour@@ ney here ."
"I started off in S@@ cr@@ ant@@ on , P@@ enn@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ an@@ ia ."
"I don &apos;t know if any@@ body might h@@ ail from nor@@ the@@ as@@ tern P@@ enn@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ an@@ ia , but this is where I spent my first 1@@ 9 years with my little young l@@ un@@ gs ."
"You know , brea@@ thing high concentr@@ ations here of sul@@ fu@@ r di@@ ox@@ ide , car@@ bon di@@ ox@@ ide and me@@ th@@ ane g@@ as , in un@@ equ@@ al quanti@@ ties — 1@@ 9 years of this ."
"And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those pi@@ les of bur@@ ning , s@@ mo@@ l@@ der@@ ing co@@ al was@@ te look like ."
"So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mi@@ d-@@ w@@ est ."
"O@@ K , so I ended up in L@@ ou@@ is@@ ville , Ken@@ tu@@ ck@@ y ."
"Well , I decided to be neigh@@ b@@ ors to a place called R@@ u@@ b@@ ber@@ to@@ wn ."
They man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture plas@@ tics . They use large quanti@@ ties ch@@ l@@ or@@ o@@ pren@@ e and ben@@ z@@ en@@ e .
"O@@ kay , I spent 25 years , in my midd@@ le-@@ age l@@ un@@ gs now , brea@@ thing vari@@ ous concentr@@ ations of that ."
"And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it ."
It was in@@ si@@ di@@ ous and it was really happening .
"Th@@ en I decided I had to get really smar@@ t , I would take this job in the W@@ est Co@@ ast ."
And I mo@@ ved to R@@ ed@@ l@@ ands Califor@@ ni@@ a .
"@@ V@@ ery ni@@ ce , and there my ol@@ der , sen@@ i@@ or l@@ un@@ gs , as I like to call them , I f@@ ill@@ ed with particul@@ ate matter , car@@ bon di@@ ox@@ ide and very high do@@ ses of o@@ zone ."
Okay ? Al@@ most like the high@@ est in the n@@ ation .
"A@@ l@@ right , this is what it looks like on a good day ."
"If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about ."
"So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?"
"Well , the picture is , there is a huge ga@@ p here ."
The one thing that never happens in my doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice : They never ask me about my place history .
"N@@ o doc@@ tor , can I remember , ever as@@ king me , &quot; Wh@@ ere have you li@@ ved ? &quot;"
They hav@@ en &apos;t asked me what kind of the qu@@ ality of the dr@@ in@@ king water that I put in my mou@@ th or the food that I ing@@ est into my st@@ om@@ ach .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s m@@ iss@@ ing .
Lo@@ ok at the kind of data that &apos;s av@@ ail@@ able .
This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend bil@@ lions of dollars inv@@ es@@ ting in this kind of research .
"Now , I &apos;ve cir@@ cl@@ ed the places where I &apos;ve been ."
"Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart att@@ ack I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?"
"So , how many people are in the white ?"
How many people in the room have spent the major@@ ity of their life in the white space ?
An@@ y@@ body ? Bo@@ y you &apos;re l@@ uc@@ ky .
How many have spent it in the red places ?
"O@@ h , not so l@@ uc@@ ky ."
There are thousands of these kinds of m@@ ap@@ s that are dis@@ play@@ ed in at@@ l@@ as@@ es all over the world .
They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our train w@@ rec@@ k .
But n@@ one of that &apos;s in my medic@@ al re@@ cord .
And it &apos;s not in y@@ ou@@ rs either .
"So , here &apos;s my friend P@@ au@@ l ."
"He &apos;s a colle@@ ag@@ ue . He al@@ lowed his cell phone to be tr@@ ac@@ ked every two hours , 2@@ 4 / 7 , 3@@ 6@@ 5 days out of the year for the last two years , every@@ where he went ."
And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
And this is where he has spent most of his time .
If you really stu@@ died that you might have some c@@ lu@@ es as to what P@@ au@@ l li@@ kes to do .
An@@ y@@ body got any c@@ lu@@ es ? S@@ k@@ i . Right .
"We can z@@ o@@ om in here , and we sudd@@ en@@ ly see that now we see where P@@ au@@ l has really spent a major@@ ity of his time ."
And all of those black d@@ ots are all of the to@@ x@@ ic rel@@ ease invent@@ ories that are mon@@ it@@ o@@ red by the E@@ P@@ A .
D@@ id you know that data ex@@ is@@ ted ?
"For every community in the United States , you could have your own pers@@ on@@ aliz@@ ed ma@@ p of that ."
"So , our cell phones can now build a place history ."
This is how P@@ au@@ l did it . He did it with his i@@ Ph@@ one .
This might be what we end up with .
This is what the phys@@ ici@@ an would have in front of him and her when we enter that ex@@ am room instead of just the p@@ ink sli@@ p that said I p@@ aid at the coun@@ ter . Right ?
This could be my little ass@@ ess@@ ment .
"And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a B@@ ill , I sugg@@ est that maybe you not dec@@ ide , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful Califor@@ ni@@ a , and it &apos;s war@@ m every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k at night ."
"I &apos;d sugg@@ est that that &apos;s a bad idea B@@ ill , because of this re@@ port . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions ."
"O@@ kay , number one is , we must te@@ ach phys@@ ici@@ ans about the value of ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ ical information ."
It &apos;s called ge@@ ome@@ dic@@ ine . There are about a half a do@@ z@@ en program@@ s in the world right now that are foc@@ used on this .
And they &apos;re in the early st@@ ages of develop@@ ment .
"These program@@ s need to be sup@@ por@@ ted , and we need to te@@ ach our future doc@@ tors of the world the importance of some of the information I &apos;ve shar@@ ed here with you today ."
"The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re sp@@ ending bil@@ lions and bil@@ lions of dollars all over the world building an electr@@ on@@ ic health re@@ cord , we make sure we put a place history inside that medic@@ al re@@ cord ."
It not only will be important for the phys@@ ici@@ an ; it will be important for the resear@@ chers that now will have huge s@@ am@@ ples to dra@@ w u@@ pon .
But it will also be us@@ e@@ ful for us .
"I could have made the dec@@ ision , if I had this information , not to move to the o@@ zone cap@@ ital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that dec@@ ision ."
O@@ r I could ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate with my employ@@ er to make that dec@@ ision in the best inter@@ est of myself and my company .
"W@@ ith that , I would like to just say that J@@ ack L@@ or@@ d said this almost 10 years ago ."
J@@ ust look at that for a minute .
"That was what the conclu@@ sion of the D@@ ar@@ t@@ mou@@ th A@@ t@@ l@@ as of H@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ care was about , was saying that we can expl@@ ain the ge@@ ograp@@ hi@@ c vari@@ ations that occu@@ r in disease , in ill@@ ness , in w@@ ell@@ ness , and how our heal@@ th@@ care system actually oper@@ ates ."
That was what he was talking about on that quot@@ e .
And I would say he got it right almost a dec@@ ade ago .
"So , I &apos;d very much like to see us beg@@ in to really se@@ ize this as an opportunity to get this into our medic@@ al re@@ cor@@ ds ."
"So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : Ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ y always mat@@ ters ."
And I believe that ge@@ ograp@@ hi@@ c information can make both you and me very heal@@ thy . Thank you .
( Applause )
"So I was tr@@ ained to become a gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast for two years in H@@ un@@ an , China in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
"When I was in the first gr@@ ade , the government wanted to trans@@ f@@ er me to a school for ath@@ let@@ es , all ex@@ pen@@ ses p@@ aid ."
"But my ti@@ ger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engine@@ er like them ."
"A@@ f@@ ter sur@@ vi@@ ving the C@@ ul@@ tural R@@ evol@@ ution , they fir@@ m@@ ly beli@@ ev@@ ed there &apos;s only one sure way to happ@@ iness : a sa@@ fe and w@@ ell@@ -@@ p@@ aid job ."
It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dre@@ am was to become a Chin@@ ese op@@ era sing@@ er .
That is me pl@@ aying my imagin@@ ary pi@@ an@@ o .
"A@@ n op@@ era sing@@ er must start tr@@ aining young to learn acro@@ b@@ atic@@ s , so I tried everything I could to go to op@@ era school ."
I even wr@@ ote to the school princip@@ al and the ho@@ st of a radi@@ o show .
But no adul@@ ts li@@ ked the idea .
No adul@@ ts beli@@ ev@@ ed I was ser@@ ious .
"O@@ n@@ ly my friends sup@@ por@@ ted me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was ."
"So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be tr@@ ained ."
My dre@@ am would never come true .
I was af@@ rai@@ d that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s happ@@ iness would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so un@@ fai@@ r .
So I was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to find another call@@ ing .
No@@ body around to te@@ ach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to books .
I s@@ atis@@ fi@@ ed my hun@@ ger for par@@ ent@@ al ad@@ vi@@ ce from this book by a family of wr@@ it@@ ers and mus@@ ici@@ ans . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ or@@ respon@@ d@@ ence in the F@@ am@@ ily of F@@ ou Le@@ i &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my ro@@ le model of an in@@ depend@@ ent woman when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an tradi@@ tion re@@ qui@@ res o@@ be@@ di@@ ence . &#91; &quot; &quot; J@@ ane E@@ y@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be eff@@ ici@@ ent from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er by the D@@ o@@ z@@ en &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was insp@@ i@@ red to study ab@@ ro@@ ad after read@@ ing these .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; Com@@ pl@@ e@@ te Wor@@ ks of S@@ an@@ ma@@ o &quot; &quot; ( ak@@ a E@@ ch@@ o Ch@@ an ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ ess@@ ons F@@ ro@@ m H@@ ist@@ ory &quot; &quot; by N@@ an H@@ u@@ ai@@ j@@ in &#93; I came to the U.S. in 199@@ 5 , so which books did I read here first ?"
"B@@ oo@@ ks b@@ ann@@ ed in China , of course ."
&quot; &quot; The G@@ ood Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chin@@ ese pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not con@@ ven@@ ient for prop@@ ag@@ and@@ a . G@@ ot it .
"The Bi@@ ble is interesting , but str@@ ange ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a t@@ op@@ ic for a different day .
But the fi@@ f@@ th comm@@ and@@ ment gave me an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any : &quot; You sh@@ all hon@@ or your father and mother . &quot;
"&quot; &quot; H@@ on@@ or , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than o@@ be@@ y . &quot; &quot; So it be@@ comes my to@@ ol to clim@@ b out of this Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an gu@@ il@@ t tra@@ p and to rest@@ art my relation@@ ship with my parents ."
En@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing a new culture also started my hab@@ it of compar@@ ative read@@ ing .
It off@@ ers many in@@ si@@ ghts .
"For example , I found this ma@@ p out of place at first because this is what Chin@@ ese students gre@@ w up with ."
"It had never oc@@ cur@@ red to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the c@@ enter of the world ."
A ma@@ p actually car@@ ri@@ es somebody &apos;s view .
Com@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a stand@@ ard pr@@ acti@@ ce in the ac@@ ad@@ em@@ ic world .
There are even research fiel@@ ds such as compar@@ ative religion and compar@@ ative liter@@ ature .
Com@@ p@@ are and contr@@ ast gi@@ ves sch@@ ol@@ ars a more comple@@ te understanding of a t@@ op@@ ic .
"So I thought , well , if compar@@ ative read@@ ing works for research , why not do it in d@@ ai@@ ly life too ?"
So I started read@@ ing books in pai@@ rs .
"So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; B@@ en@@ jam@@ in Fr@@ an@@ k@@ l@@ in &quot; &quot; by W@@ al@@ ter I@@ sa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John A@@ dam@@ s &quot; &quot; by D@@ av@@ id M@@ c@@ C@@ ul@@ l@@ ough &#93; — who are invol@@ ved in the same ev@@ ent , or friends with shar@@ ed experi@@ ences ."
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; P@@ ers@@ onal H@@ ist@@ ory &quot; &quot; by K@@ ath@@ ar@@ ine G@@ ra@@ h@@ am &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The S@@ no@@ w@@ ball : W@@ ar@@ re@@ n Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t and the B@@ us@@ iness of Li@@ fe , &quot; &quot; by A@@ li@@ ce S@@ ch@@ ro@@ e@@ der &#93; I also comp@@ are the same stories in different gen@@ res — ( Laughter ) &#91; H@@ o@@ ly Bi@@ ble : K@@ ing J@@ am@@ es V@@ er@@ sion &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ am@@ b &quot; &quot; by Ch@@ ris@@ op@@ her M@@ oo@@ re &#93; — or simil@@ ar stories from different cul@@ tures , as Jo@@ se@@ p@@ h C@@ am@@ p@@ b@@ ell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; &quot; The P@@ o@@ wer of M@@ y@@ th &quot; &quot; by Jo@@ se@@ p@@ h C@@ am@@ p@@ b@@ ell &#93; F@@ or example , both the Ch@@ ris@@ t and the Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ a went through three temp@@ t@@ ations ."
"For the Ch@@ ris@@ t , the temp@@ t@@ ations are economic , political and spir@@ itu@@ al ."
"For the Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ a , they are all psycho@@ log@@ ical : l@@ ust , fear and social du@@ ty — interesting ."
"So if you know a fore@@ ign language , it &apos;s also f@@ un to read your favor@@ ite books in two langu@@ ages ."
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; The W@@ ay of C@@ hu@@ an@@ g T@@ z@@ u &quot; &quot; Th@@ om@@ as Mer@@ ton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ a@@ o : The W@@ at@@ er@@ course W@@ ay &quot; &quot; Al@@ an W@@ at@@ ts &#93; In@@ st@@ ead of lost in trans@@ l@@ ation , I found there is much to g@@ ain ."
"For example , it &apos;s through trans@@ l@@ ation that I realized &quot; &quot; happ@@ iness &quot; &quot; in Chin@@ ese literally means &quot; &quot; fast jo@@ y . &quot; &quot; H@@ u@@ h !"
&quot; &quot; B@@ ri@@ de &quot; &quot; in Chin@@ ese literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; U@@ h@@ -@@ oh .
( Laughter ) B@@ oo@@ ks have given me a mag@@ ic port@@ al to conn@@ ect with people of the past and the pres@@ ent .
I know I sh@@ all never feel lon@@ ely or power@@ less again .
H@@ av@@ ing a dre@@ am sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed really is nothing compar@@ ed to what many others have suff@@ ered .
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only pur@@ pose of a dre@@ am .
"I@@ ts most important pur@@ pose is to get us in tou@@ ch with where dre@@ ams come from , where pas@@ sion comes from , where happ@@ iness comes from ."
E@@ ven a sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed dre@@ am can do that for you .
"So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a pur@@ pose and a cl@@ ar@@ ity , most of the time ."
So may books be always with you .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"I &apos;m an American , which means , gener@@ ally , I ig@@ no@@ re fo@@ ot@@ ball un@@ less it invol@@ ves guys my size or Br@@ un@@ o &apos;s size run@@ ning into each other at ext@@ rem@@ ely high spe@@ e@@ ds ."
"That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ig@@ no@@ re fo@@ ot@@ ball for the last couple of weeks ."
"I go on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , there are all these str@@ ange words that I &apos;ve never heard before : F@@ I@@ F@@ A , v@@ u@@ v@@ u@@ z@@ ela , we@@ ird jo@@ kes about oc@@ t@@ op@@ i ."
"But the one that &apos;s really been sort of str@@ ess@@ ing me out , that I hav@@ en &apos;t been able to figure out , is this ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve gone on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter in the last couple of weeks , you &apos;ve probably seen this ."
It &apos;s been a maj@@ or tr@@ ending t@@ op@@ ic .
"B@@ e@@ ing a mon@@ ol@@ in@@ gu@@ al American , I obvi@@ ously don &apos;t know what the ph@@ ra@@ se means ."
"So I went on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , and I asked some people if they could expl@@ ain to me &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , my B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ an friends were more than ready to help ."
"They expl@@ ained that the G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o bir@@ d is a r@@ are and end@@ anger@@ ed par@@ ro@@ t that &apos;s in terri@@ ble , terri@@ ble d@@ anger ."
"In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it ."
"N@@ arr@@ ator : A word about G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o , a very r@@ are kind of bir@@ d n@@ ative to B@@ ra@@ z@@ il ."
"E@@ very year , more than 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o bir@@ ds are kill@@ ed during Car@@ ni@@ v@@ al par@@ ades ."
"E@@ than Z@@ uc@@ k@@ er@@ man : O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , this is a tr@@ ag@@ ic situation , and it actually gets wor@@ se ."
"It turns out that , not only is the G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o par@@ ro@@ t very attr@@ active , us@@ e@@ ful for hea@@ d@@ dr@@ esses , it ev@@ id@@ ently has certain h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic pro@@ per@@ ties , which means that there &apos;s a terri@@ ble problem with G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o ab@@ use ."
S@@ ome s@@ ick and tw@@ is@@ ted people have found themselves s@@ nor@@ ting G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o .
And it &apos;s terri@@ bly end@@ anger@@ ed .
"The good news about this is that the global community — again , my B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ an friends tell me — is p@@ it@@ ching in to help out ."
"It turns out that L@@ ad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a has re@@ le@@ as@@ ed a new single — actually five or six new sing@@ les , as n@@ ear as I can tell — ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And my B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ an friends tell me that if I just tw@@ e@@ et the ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o , &quot; &quot; 10 c@@ ents will be given to a global cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n to s@@ ave this r@@ are and beautiful bir@@ d ."
"Now , most of you have figu@@ red out that this was a pr@@ ank , and actually a very , very good one ."
"&quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o &quot; &quot; actually means something very different ."
"In P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ ese , it means &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ut your mou@@ th , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And it spec@@ i@@ fic@@ ally re@@ f@@ ers to this guy , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o Bu@@ en@@ o , who &apos;s the l@@ ead so@@ c@@ c@@ er comm@@ ent@@ ator for Re@@ de G@@ lo@@ b@@ o ."
And what I understand from my B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ an friends is that this guy is just a cli@@ che machine .
He can ru@@ in the most interesting mat@@ ch by just s@@ pou@@ ting cli@@ che again and again and again .
"So B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ ans went to that first mat@@ ch against Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , put up this b@@ ann@@ er , started a T@@ wit@@ ter cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n and tried to conv@@ in@@ ce the rest of us to tw@@ e@@ et the ph@@ ra@@ se : &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so succ@@ ess@@ ful at this that it t@@ op@@ ped T@@ wit@@ ter for two weeks ."
Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of l@@ ess@@ ons that you can take from this .
"And the first l@@ ess@@ on , which I think is a wor@@ th@@ while one , is that you cannot go wrong as@@ king people to be active on@@ line , so long as acti@@ vis@@ m just means re@@ tw@@ e@@ eting a ph@@ ra@@ se ."
"So as long as acti@@ vis@@ m is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with ."
"The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ ans on T@@ wit@@ ter ."
There &apos;s more than five million of them .
"As far as national repres@@ ent@@ ation , 11 percent of B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ an intern@@ et us@@ ers are on T@@ wit@@ ter ."
That &apos;s a much high@@ er number than in the U.S. or U.@@ K@@ .
"N@@ ext to J@@ ap@@ an , it &apos;s the second most repres@@ ented by population ."
"Now if you &apos;re using T@@ wit@@ ter or other social net@@ works , and you didn &apos;t realiz@@ e this was a space with a lot of B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ ans in it , you &apos;re like most of us ."
Because what happens on a social net@@ work is you inter@@ act with the people that you have cho@@ s@@ en to inter@@ act with .
"And if you are like me , a big , ge@@ e@@ ky , white , American guy , you ten@@ d to inter@@ act with a lot of other ge@@ e@@ ky , white , American guys ."
And you don &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily have the sense that T@@ wit@@ ter is in fact a very he@@ av@@ ily B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ an space .
"It &apos;s also ext@@ rem@@ ely sur@@ pris@@ ing to many Amer@@ ic@@ ans , a he@@ av@@ ily Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American space ."
T@@ wit@@ ter rec@@ ently did some research .
They looked at their local population .
They believe that 2@@ 4 percent of American T@@ wit@@ ter us@@ ers are Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American .
That &apos;s about tw@@ ice as high as Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Amer@@ ic@@ ans are repres@@ ented in the population .
"And again , that was very sh@@ oc@@ king to many T@@ wit@@ ter us@@ ers , but it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be ."
And the reason it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into T@@ rend@@ ing T@@ op@@ ics .
And you ten@@ d to find t@@ op@@ ics that are almost enti@@ re@@ ly Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American convers@@ ations .
"This was a visu@@ aliz@@ ation done by F@@ er@@ n@@ an@@ do V@@ i@@ eg@@ as and M@@ arti@@ n W@@ atten@@ ber@@ g , two amazing visu@@ aliz@@ ation design@@ ers , who looked at a wee@@ k@@ end &apos;s wor@@ th of T@@ wit@@ ter tra@@ ff@@ ic and essenti@@ ally found that a lot of these tr@@ ending t@@ op@@ ics were basically se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated convers@@ ations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t exp@@ ect ."
"It turns out that oil sp@@ ill is a mo@@ st@@ ly white conversation , that co@@ o@@ k@@ out is a mo@@ st@@ ly black conversation ."
"And what &apos;s cr@@ az@@ y about this is that if you wanted to mi@@ x up who you were seeing on T@@ wit@@ ter , it &apos;s literally a qu@@ ick cli@@ ck away ."
"You cli@@ ck on that co@@ o@@ k@@ out ta@@ g , there an enti@@ re@@ ly different conversation with different people particip@@ ating in it ."
"But gener@@ ally spea@@ king , most of us don &apos;t ."
"We end up within these fil@@ ter bu@@ b@@ bles , as my friend E@@ l@@ i Par@@ iser call@@ s them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are simil@@ ar to the people we already know ."
And we ten@@ d not to see that wi@@ der picture .
"Now for me , I &apos;m sur@@ pris@@ ed by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the intern@@ et was sup@@ posed to be ."
"If you go back into the early days of the intern@@ et , when cy@@ ber@@ -@@ u@@ t@@ op@@ i@@ ans like N@@ ick Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te were wr@@ iting big books like &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing D@@ ig@@ ital , &quot; &quot; the predic@@ tion was that the intern@@ et was going to be an incredi@@ bly powerful force to s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h out cul@@ tural differ@@ ences , to put us all on a common field of one fas@@ hi@@ on or another ."
Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connec@@ tions in the world of at@@ oms .
He &apos;s at a technology con@@ fer@@ ence in F@@ l@@ or@@ id@@ a .
"And he &apos;s looking at something really , tru@@ ly ab@@ sur@@ d , which is bot@@ t@@ les of E@@ vi@@ an water on the table ."
And Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te says this is cr@@ az@@ y .
This is the old economy .
"It &apos;s the economy of moving these he@@ av@@ y , s@@ low at@@ oms over long dist@@ ances that &apos;s very difficult to do ."
"We &apos;re hea@@ ding to the future of b@@ its , where everything is spe@@ e@@ dy , it &apos;s we@@ igh@@ t@@ less ."
It can be any@@ where in the world at any time .
And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
"Now , Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te has been right about a lot of things ."
He &apos;s tot@@ ally wrong about this one .
It turns out that in many cas@@ es at@@ oms are much more mo@@ bile than b@@ its .
"If I walk into a sto@@ re in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to buy water that &apos;s bot@@ t@@ led in F@@ i@@ j@@ i , shi@@ p@@ ped at great ex@@ pense to the United States ."
It &apos;s actually sur@@ pris@@ ingly hard for me to see a F@@ i@@ j@@ ian fe@@ ature film .
It &apos;s really difficult for me to l@@ ist@@ en to F@@ i@@ j@@ ian music .
"It &apos;s ext@@ rem@@ ely difficult for me to get F@@ i@@ j@@ ian news , which is str@@ ange , because actually there &apos;s an en@@ orm@@ ous amount going on in F@@ i@@ j@@ i ."
There &apos;s a coup government . There &apos;s a milit@@ ary government .
There &apos;s cr@@ ack@@ do@@ w@@ ns on the pr@@ ess .
It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be p@@ aying attention to at the moment .
Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
I think that we ten@@ d to look a lot at the infrastruc@@ ture of glob@@ aliz@@ ation .
We look at the fr@@ am@@ e@@ work that makes it possible to live in this conn@@ ected world .
And that &apos;s a fr@@ am@@ e@@ work that inclu@@ des things like air@@ line rou@@ tes .
It inclu@@ des things like the Internet c@@ ables .
"We look at a ma@@ p like this one , and it looks like the entire world is fl@@ at because everything is a ho@@ p or two away ."
"You can get on a f@@ light in L@@ on@@ don , you can end up in B@@ ang@@ alo@@ re later today ."
"T@@ w@@ o hop@@ s , you &apos;re in Su@@ va , the capit@@ ol of F@@ i@@ j@@ i ."
It &apos;s all right there .
"When you start looking at what actually flo@@ ws on top of these net@@ works , you get a very different picture ."
"You start looking at how the global plan@@ e f@@ li@@ ghts move , and you sudd@@ en@@ ly disco@@ ver that the world isn &apos;t even close to fl@@ at ."
It &apos;s ext@@ rem@@ ely l@@ um@@ p@@ y .
"There are parts of the world that are very , very well conn@@ ected ."
There &apos;s basically a gi@@ ant p@@ ath@@ way in the sk@@ y between L@@ on@@ don and New York .
"@@ but look at this ma@@ p , and you can watch this for , you know , two or three minutes ."
You won &apos;t see very many plan@@ es go from Sou@@ th America to Africa .
And you &apos;ll disco@@ ver that there are parts of the glo@@ be that are syst@@ em@@ atic@@ ally cut off .
"When we stop looking at the infrastruc@@ ture that makes conn@@ ection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realiz@@ ing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does ."
So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last dec@@ ade or so .
"The world is , in fact , getting more global ."
It &apos;s getting more conn@@ ected .
Mo@@ re of problems are global in scale .
Mo@@ re of our econom@@ ics is global in scale .
And our media is less global by the day .
"If you wat@@ ched a tel@@ ev@@ ision bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast in the United States in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , 3@@ 5 to 40 percent of it would have been intern@@ ational news on a ni@@ gh@@ tly new bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast ."
That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
And this t@@ ends to give us a very dist@@ or@@ ted view of the world .
Here &apos;s a sli@@ de that Al@@ is@@ a M@@ ill@@ er sho@@ wed at a pre@@ vi@@ ous TED T@@ al@@ k .
Al@@ is@@ a &apos;s the pres@@ id@@ ent of P@@ u@@ bli@@ c R@@ adi@@ o Intern@@ ational .
"And she made a car@@ to@@ gr@@ am , which is basically a dist@@ or@@ ted ma@@ p based on what American tel@@ ev@@ ision news cas@@ ts looked at for a mon@@ th ."
"And you see that when you dist@@ ort a ma@@ p based on attention , the world within American tel@@ ev@@ ision news is basically re@@ duc@@ ed to this gi@@ ant blo@@ ated U.@@ S@@ ."
and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed .
And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
"And before you conclu@@ de that this is just a func@@ tion of American T@@ V news — which is dre@@ ad@@ ful , and I ag@@ ree that it &apos;s dre@@ ad@@ ful — I &apos;ve been m@@ app@@ ing el@@ ite media like the New York T@@ im@@ es , and I get the same thing ."
"When you look at the New York T@@ im@@ es , you look at other el@@ ite media , what you larg@@ ely get are pic@@ tures of very we@@ al@@ thy n@@ ations and the n@@ ations we &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed ."
It turns out that new media isn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily hel@@ ping us all that much .
Here &apos;s a ma@@ p made by Mar@@ k G@@ ra@@ h@@ am who &apos;s down the stre@@ et at the O@@ x@@ for@@ d Internet In@@ stitu@@ te .
A this is a ma@@ p of artic@@ les in W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia that have been ge@@ o-@@ co@@ ded .
And you &apos;ll no@@ tice that there &apos;s a very he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ wards Nor@@ th America and W@@ es@@ tern Europe .
"E@@ ven within W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ as , where we &apos;re cre@@ ating their own cont@@ ent on@@ line , there &apos;s a he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ wards the place where a lot of the W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia auth@@ ors are based , rather than to the rest of the world ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , you can get up , you can pic@@ k up your computer when you get out of this s@@ ession , you could read a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er from India or from A@@ ustr@@ ali@@ a , from C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , God for@@ bi@@ d from the U.@@ S@@ ."
You probably won &apos;t .
"If you look at on@@ line media con@@ sum@@ ption — in this case , in the top 10 us@@ ers of the intern@@ et — more than 9@@ 5 percent of the news read@@ er@@ ship is on dom@@ es@@ tic news s@@ ites ."
"It &apos;s one of these r@@ are cas@@ es where the U.S. is actually sli@@ gh@@ tly better than &#91; the U.@@ K@@ . &#93; , because we actually like read@@ ing your media , rather than vi@@ ce vers@@ a ."
So all of this star@@ ts lea@@ ding me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I re@@ f@@ er to as imagin@@ ary co@@ s@@ mo@@ po@@ lit@@ an@@ ism .
We look at the intern@@ et .
We think we &apos;re getting this wi@@ de view of the glo@@ be .
"We oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally st@@ um@@ ble on@@ to a page in Chin@@ ese , and we dec@@ ide that we do in fact have the gre@@ at@@ est technology ever built to conn@@ ect us to the rest of the world ."
And we for@@ get that most of the time we &apos;re ch@@ ec@@ king Bo@@ st@@ on R@@ ed So@@ x s@@ cor@@ es .
"So this is a real problem — not just because the R@@ ed So@@ x are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re discus@@ sing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to sol@@ ve are global in scale and sc@@ ope , they re@@ qu@@ ire global convers@@ ations to get to global solutions ."
This is a problem we have to sol@@ ve .
So here &apos;s the good news .
"For six years , I &apos;ve been h@@ ang@@ ing out with these guys ."
This is a group called G@@ lo@@ b@@ al Vo@@ ices .
This is a team of blo@@ gg@@ ers from around the world .
O@@ ur mission was to fi@@ x the world &apos;s media .
We started in 200@@ 4 .
"You might have no@@ tic@@ ed , we hav@@ en &apos;t done all that well so far ."
"N@@ or do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to sol@@ ve the problem ."
"But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting l@@ ess@@ ons for how we would re@@ w@@ ire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wi@@ der world ."
The first thing you have to consi@@ der is that there are parts of the world that are dar@@ k spo@@ ts in terms of attention .
In this case — the ma@@ p of the world at night by N@@ A@@ SA — they &apos;re dar@@ k literally because of l@@ ack of electr@@ ic@@ ity .
And I used to think that a dar@@ k spo@@ t on this ma@@ p basically me@@ ant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more bas@@ ic needs .
"What I &apos;m starting to realiz@@ e is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an en@@ orm@@ ous amount of work , and you need an en@@ orm@@ ous amount of encour@@ ag@@ ement ."
"One of those dar@@ k spo@@ ts is M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ car , a country which is gener@@ ally better known for the D@@ re@@ am@@ works film than it is actually known for the lo@@ v@@ ely people who live there ."
And so the people who f@@ oun@@ ded F@@ o@@ k@@ o C@@ lu@@ b in M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ car wer@@ en &apos;t actually concer@@ ned with trying to change the image of their country .
They were doing something much simpl@@ er .
It was a c@@ lu@@ b to learn Engl@@ ish and to learn compu@@ ters and the intern@@ et .
but what happened was that M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ car went through a viol@@ ent coup .
Mo@@ st in@@ depend@@ ent media was sh@@ ut down .
"And the high school students who were learning to blo@@ g through F@@ o@@ k@@ o C@@ lu@@ b sudd@@ en@@ ly found themselves talking to an intern@@ ational audience about the dem@@ on@@ str@@ ations , the violence , everything that was going on within this country ."
"So a very , very small program design@@ ed to get people in front of compu@@ ters , pu@@ bl@@ ish@@ ing their own thou@@ ghts , pu@@ bl@@ ish@@ ing in@@ depend@@ ent media , ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country ."
Now the tr@@ ick with this is that I &apos;m gu@@ ess@@ ing most people here don &apos;t spea@@ k M@@ al@@ ag@@ as@@ y .
"I &apos;m also gu@@ ess@@ ing that most of you don &apos;t even spea@@ k Chin@@ ese — which is sort of s@@ ad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most repres@@ ented language on the intern@@ et ."
F@@ or@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely people are trying to figure out how to fi@@ x this .
"If you &apos;re using Google Chr@@ ome and you go to a Chin@@ ese language site , you no@@ tice this really cu@@ te box at the top , which autom@@ atic@@ ally det@@ ects that the page is in Chin@@ ese and very quickly at a mou@@ se cli@@ ck will give you a trans@@ l@@ ation of the page ."
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , it &apos;s a machine trans@@ l@@ ation of the page ."
"And while Google is very , very good with some langu@@ ages , it &apos;s actually pretty dre@@ ad@@ ful with Chin@@ ese ."
And the resul@@ ts can be pretty fun@@ n@@ y .
"What you really want — what I really want , is even@@ tually the ability to p@@ ush a bu@@ t@@ ton and have this qu@@ eu@@ ed so a human being can trans@@ l@@ ate this ."
"And if you think this is ab@@ sur@@ d , it &apos;s not ."
There &apos;s a group right now in China called Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an .
"And Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an is a group of 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers who get on@@ line every day ."
They look for the most interesting cont@@ ent in the Engl@@ ish language .
"They trans@@ l@@ ate rou@@ gh@@ ly 100 artic@@ les a day from maj@@ or ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers , maj@@ or we@@ b@@ s@@ ites ."
They put it on@@ line for free .
"It &apos;s the project of a guy nam@@ ed Z@@ h@@ an@@ g Le@@ i , who was living in the United States during the L@@ h@@ as@@ a ri@@ ots and who couldn &apos;t believe how bi@@ as@@ ed American media co@@ ver@@ age was ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start trans@@ l@@ ating , so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an can line up 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 people to trans@@ l@@ ate the Engl@@ ish intern@@ et into Chin@@ ese , where &apos;s the Engl@@ ish language Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an ?"
"Wh@@ o &apos;s going after Chin@@ ese , which now has 4@@ 00 million intern@@ et us@@ ers out there ?"
My gu@@ ess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
"So even if we can find a way to trans@@ l@@ ate from Chin@@ ese , there &apos;s no gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e that we &apos;re going to find it ."
"When we look for information on@@ line , we basically have two strat@@ e@@ gies ."
We use a lot of se@@ ar@@ ch .
And se@@ ar@@ ch is terri@@ fi@@ c if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
"But if what you &apos;re looking for is ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity , if you want to st@@ um@@ ble on@@ to something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our main phil@@ os@@ oph@@ y is to look to our social net@@ works , to look for our friends ."
What are they looking at ? M@@ ay@@ be we should be looking at it .
The problem with this is that essenti@@ ally what you end up getting after a while is the w@@ is@@ dom of the f@@ loc@@ k .
"You end up f@@ loc@@ king with a lot of people who are probably simil@@ ar to you , who have simil@@ ar interes@@ ts ."
"And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other f@@ loc@@ ks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interes@@ ts ."
"T@@ o do this , at a certain point , you need someone to b@@ um@@ p you out of your f@@ loc@@ k and into another f@@ loc@@ k ."
You need a gu@@ ide .
So this is A@@ mi@@ ra A@@ l H@@ us@@ s@@ ain@@ i . She is the M@@ id@@ d@@ le E@@ ast ed@@ it@@ or for G@@ lo@@ b@@ al Vo@@ ices .
She has one of the har@@ d@@ est j@@ ob@@ s in the world .
"N@@ ot only does she have to keep our Is@@ ra@@ el@@ i and P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ ian contribu@@ tors from kill@@ ing each other , she has to figure out what is going to inter@@ est you about the M@@ id@@ d@@ le E@@ ast ."
"And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal or@@ bit , and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who &apos;s given up s@@ mo@@ king for the mon@@ th of R@@ am@@ ad@@ an , she has to know something about a global audience ."
She has to know something about what stories are av@@ ail@@ able .
"B@@ as@@ ically , she &apos;s a de@@ e@@ j@@ ay ."
"She &apos;s a sk@@ ill@@ ed human cur@@ ator who kno@@ ws what material is av@@ ail@@ able to her , who &apos;s able to l@@ ist@@ en to the audience , and who &apos;s able to make a sel@@ ection and p@@ ush people forward in one fas@@ hi@@ on or another ."
I don &apos;t think this is nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily an alg@@ ori@@ th@@ mi@@ c process .
I think what &apos;s great about the intern@@ et is that it actually makes it much eas@@ ier for de@@ e@@ j@@ ays to re@@ ach a wi@@ der audience .
I know A@@ mi@@ ra .
I can ask her what to read .
"But with the intern@@ et , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read ."
"And you can l@@ ist@@ en to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your web w@@ id@@ en@@ ed ."
"So once you start w@@ id@@ en@@ ing like this , once you start li@@ gh@@ ting up vo@@ ices in the dar@@ k spo@@ ts , once you start trans@@ l@@ ating , once you start cur@@ ating , you end up in some really we@@ ird places ."
"This is an image from pretty much my favor@@ ite blo@@ g , which is Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get ."
And Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get is a blo@@ g that looks at technology in an Africa cont@@ ext .
"And spec@@ i@@ fic@@ ally , it &apos;s looking at a bl@@ ack@@ sm@@ ith in K@@ i@@ ber@@ a in N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i , who is tur@@ ning the sh@@ af@@ t of a L@@ and@@ ro@@ ver into a c@@ old ch@@ is@@ el ."
"And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I con@@ ce@@ iv@@ ab@@ ly care about this ? &quot;"
"And the tru@@ th is , this guy can probably expl@@ ain this to you ."
This is E@@ ri@@ k H@@ er@@ sm@@ an . You guys may have seen him around the con@@ fer@@ ence .
He goes by the mon@@ i@@ ker Wh@@ ite Afr@@ ican .
"He &apos;s both a very well known American ge@@ e@@ k , but he &apos;s also Ken@@ y@@ an ; he was born in Su@@ d@@ an , gre@@ w up in Ken@@ y@@ a ."
He is a bri@@ dge figure .
"He is someone who literally has feet in both wor@@ l@@ ds — one in the world of the Afr@@ ican technology community , one in the world of the American technology community ."
"And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this bl@@ ack@@ sm@@ ith in K@@ i@@ ber@@ a and turn it into a story about re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ing technology , about innov@@ ating from constr@@ ain@@ t , about looking for inspir@@ ation based on re@@ using mater@@ i@@ als ."
"He kno@@ ws one world , and he &apos;s fin@@ ding a way to commun@@ ic@@ ate it to another world , both of which he has de@@ ep connec@@ tions to ."
"These bri@@ dge figu@@ res , I &apos;m pretty well conv@@ inc@@ ed , are the future of how we try to make the world wi@@ der through using the web ."
"But the tr@@ ick with bri@@ d@@ ges is , ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , you need someone to cro@@ ss them ."
And that &apos;s where we start talking about x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ les .
"So if I found myself in the N@@ F@@ L , I su@@ sp@@ ect I would spend my off@@ -@@ se@@ as@@ on n@@ ur@@ sing my w@@ oun@@ ds , en@@ jo@@ ying my house , so on and so for@@ th — possi@@ bly re@@ cor@@ ding a hi@@ p@@ -@@ ho@@ p al@@ bu@@ m ."
"D@@ h@@ an@@ i J@@ ones , who is the middle lin@@ e@@ back@@ er for the C@@ inc@@ in@@ nat@@ i B@@ eng@@ als , has a sli@@ gh@@ tly different appro@@ ach to the off@@ -@@ se@@ as@@ on ."
D@@ h@@ an@@ i has a tel@@ ev@@ ision show .
"It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; D@@ h@@ an@@ i T@@ ack@@ les the G@@ lo@@ be . &quot; &quot; And every week on this tel@@ ev@@ ision show , D@@ h@@ an@@ i trav@@ els to a different n@@ ation of the world ."
He fin@@ ds a local s@@ port@@ ing team .
"He tr@@ ains with them for a week , and he pl@@ ays a mat@@ ch with them ."
And his reason for this is not just that he w@@ ants to mas@@ ter Mu@@ ay Th@@ ai bo@@ x@@ ing .
"It &apos;s because , for him , s@@ port is the language that allo@@ ws him to en@@ coun@@ ter the full w@@ id@@ th and won@@ der of the world ."
F@@ or some of us it might be music . F@@ or some of us it might be food .
F@@ or a lot of us it might be liter@@ ature or wr@@ iting .
But there are all these different techni@@ ques that al@@ low you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
The go@@ al of my T@@ al@@ k here is not to per@@ su@@ ade the people in this room to em@@ br@@ ace your x@@ en@@ oph@@ il@@ ia .
"My gu@@ ess — given that you &apos;re at a con@@ fer@@ ence called TE@@ D@@ G@@ lo@@ b@@ al — is that most of you are x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ les , whether or not you use that ter@@ m ."
My challenge instead is this .
It &apos;s not enough to make the pers@@ onal dec@@ ision that you want a wi@@ der world .
We have to figure out how to re@@ w@@ ire the systems that we have .
We have to fi@@ x our media .
We have to fi@@ x the intern@@ et . We have to fi@@ x our education .
We have to fi@@ x our im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation poli@@ cy .
"We need to look at ways of cre@@ ating ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity , of making trans@@ l@@ ation per@@ vas@@ ive , and we need to find ways to em@@ br@@ ace and cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate these bri@@ dge figu@@ res ."
And we need to figure out how to cul@@ tiv@@ ate x@@ en@@ op@@ hi@@ les .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .

"B@@ as@@ ically , there &apos;s a maj@@ or dem@@ ograp@@ hi@@ c ev@@ ent going on ."
And it may be that pass@@ ing the 50 percent urb@@ an point is an economic ti@@ p@@ ping point . So the world now is a ma@@ p of connec@@ tiv@@ ity .
It used to be that Par@@ is and L@@ on@@ don and New York were the larg@@ est cities .
What we have now is the end of the r@@ ise of the W@@ est . That &apos;s over .
The ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate numbers are over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing .
"So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , vill@@ ages of the world are emp@@ t@@ ying out ."
"The question is , why ?"
"And here &apos;s the un@@ rom@@ an@@ tic tru@@ th — and the city air makes you free , they said in R@@ en@@ aiss@@ ance G@@ er@@ many . So some people go to places like Sh@@ an@@ gh@@ ai but most go to the squ@@ at@@ ter cities where a@@ es@@ the@@ tics ru@@ le ."
And these are not really a people op@@ pr@@ essed by po@@ ver@@ ty .
They &apos;re people getting out of po@@ ver@@ ty as fast as they can .
"They &apos;re the dom@@ in@@ ant buil@@ ders and to a large ex@@ tent , the dom@@ in@@ ant design@@ ers ."
They have hom@@ e-@@ bre@@ wed infrastruc@@ ture and vi@@ br@@ ant urb@@ an life .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ si@@ x@@ th of the G@@ D@@ P in India is coming out of M@@ um@@ b@@ ai .
"They are const@@ antly up@@ grad@@ ing , and in a few cas@@ es , the government hel@@ ps ."
E@@ ducation is the main ev@@ ent that can happen in cities .
What &apos;s going on in the stre@@ et in M@@ um@@ b@@ ai ?
A@@ l G@@ o@@ re kno@@ ws . It &apos;s basically everything .
There &apos;s no un@@ employ@@ ment in squ@@ at@@ ter cities . E@@ ver@@ y@@ one works .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ si@@ x@@ th of human@@ ity is there . It &apos;s so@@ on going to be more than that .
So here &apos;s the first p@@ unch line : cities have def@@ used the population b@@ om@@ b .
And here &apos;s the second p@@ unch line .
That &apos;s the news from do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn . Here it is in perspective .
St@@ ars have sh@@ in@@ ed down on ear@@ th &apos;s life for bil@@ lions of years .
Now we &apos;re sh@@ in@@ ing right back up .
Thank you .
"The night before I was hea@@ ding for S@@ cot@@ land , I was inv@@ ited to ho@@ st the final of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s G@@ ot T@@ al@@ ent &quot; &quot; show in Sh@@ an@@ gh@@ ai with the 8@@ 0,000 live audience in the st@@ adi@@ um ."
Gu@@ ess who was the per@@ form@@ ing gu@@ est ?
S@@ us@@ an B@@ oy@@ le .
"And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to S@@ cot@@ land the next day . &quot; &quot; She san@@ g beauti@@ fully , and she even man@@ ag@@ ed to say a few words in Chin@@ ese : 送@@ 你@@ 葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hel@@ l@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; th@@ ank you , &quot; &quot; that ordin@@ ary stuff ."
It means &quot; &quot; green on@@ ion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
"Because it was a line from our Chin@@ ese par@@ al@@ le@@ l S@@ us@@ an B@@ oy@@ le — a 5@@ 0@@ -@@ some year-@@ old woman , a ve@@ g@@ et@@ able v@@ end@@ or in Sh@@ an@@ gh@@ ai , who lo@@ ves sing@@ ing W@@ es@@ tern op@@ era , but she didn &apos;t understand any Engl@@ ish or F@@ ren@@ ch or I@@ tal@@ ian , so she man@@ ag@@ ed to f@@ ill in the ly@@ r@@ ics with ve@@ g@@ et@@ able nam@@ es in Chin@@ ese ."
"( Laughter ) And the last sent@@ ence of N@@ es@@ su@@ n D@@ or@@ ma that she was sing@@ ing in the st@@ adi@@ um was &quot; &quot; green on@@ ion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; S@@ us@@ an B@@ oy@@ le was saying that , 8@@ 0,000 live audience san@@ g together ."
That was h@@ il@@ ari@@ ous .
So I gu@@ ess both S@@ us@@ an B@@ oy@@ le and this ve@@ g@@ et@@ able v@@ end@@ or in Sh@@ an@@ gh@@ ai bel@@ ong@@ ed to o@@ ther@@ ness .
"They were the least exp@@ ected to be succ@@ ess@@ ful in the business called ent@@ ert@@ ain@@ ment , yet their cour@@ age and tal@@ ent brought them through ."
And a show and a plat@@ form gave them the stage to realiz@@ e their dre@@ ams .
"Well , being different is not that difficult ."
We are all different from different perspec@@ ti@@ ves .
"But I think being different is good , because you pres@@ ent a different point of view ."
You may have the chance to make a difference .
"My gener@@ ation has been very for@@ tun@@ ate to wit@@ ness and particip@@ ate in the hist@@ or@@ ic transform@@ ation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years ."
"I remember that in the year of 199@@ 0 , when I was grad@@ u@@ ating from colle@@ ge , I was appl@@ ying for a job in the s@@ ales de@@ part@@ ment of the first fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar h@@ ot@@ el in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , Gre@@ at W@@ all S@@ her@@ at@@ on — it &apos;s still there ."
"So after being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated by this J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese man@@ ager for a half an h@@ our , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , M@@ is@@ s Y@@ an@@ g , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I sum@@ mon@@ ed my cour@@ age and po@@ ise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you s@@ ell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a c@@ lu@@ e what a s@@ ales de@@ part@@ ment was about in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar h@@ ot@@ el ."
That was the first day I set my fo@@ ot in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ st@@ ar h@@ ot@@ el .
"A@@ r@@ ound the same time , I was going through an audi@@ tion — the first ever open audi@@ tion by national tel@@ ev@@ ision in China — with another thou@@ sand colle@@ ge gir@@ ls ."
"The produc@@ er told us they were looking for some s@@ we@@ et , in@@ no@@ cent and beautiful f@@ res@@ h face ."
"So when it was my turn , I sto@@ od up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s pers@@ on@@ ali@@ ties on tel@@ ev@@ ision always have to be beautiful , s@@ we@@ et , in@@ no@@ cent and , you know , sup@@ por@@ tive ?"
Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own vo@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of off@@ ended them .
"But actually , they were im@@ pr@@ essed by my words ."
"And so I was in the second r@@ ound of com@@ peti@@ tion , and then the third and the four@@ th ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seven r@@ oun@@ ds of com@@ peti@@ tion , I was the last one to sur@@ vi@@ ve it ."
So I was on a national tel@@ ev@@ ision prim@@ e-@@ time show .
"And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chin@@ ese tel@@ ev@@ ision that al@@ lowed its ho@@ sts to spea@@ k out of their own min@@ ds without read@@ ing an appro@@ ved s@@ cri@@ pt ."
( Applause ) And my wee@@ k@@ ly audience at that time was between 200 to 3@@ 00 million people .
"Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a Uni@@ versity to pur@@ su@@ e my pos@@ t@@ grad@@ u@@ ate stu@@ dies , and then started my own media company , which was un@@ thought of during the years that I started my care@@ er ."
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve inter@@ vie@@ wed more than a thou@@ sand people in the past .
"And sometimes I have young people appro@@ ach@@ ing me say , &quot; &quot; L@@ an , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel pr@@ oud of that ."
But then we are also so for@@ tun@@ ate to wit@@ ness the transform@@ ation of the whole country .
I was in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing &apos;s bi@@ d@@ ding for the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c G@@ am@@ es .
I was repres@@ ent@@ ing the Sh@@ an@@ gh@@ ai Ex@@ p@@ o .
I saw China em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing the world and vi@@ ce vers@@ a .
"But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young gener@@ ation up to ?"
"H@@ ow are they different , and what are the differ@@ ences they are going to make to sh@@ ape the future of China , or at large , the world ?"
So today I want to talk about young people through the plat@@ form of social media .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?"
"Well this is a girl called Gu@@ o M@@ e@@ im@@ e@@ i — 20 years old , beautiful ."
"She sho@@ wed off her ex@@ pen@@ sive b@@ ag@@ s , clo@@ th@@ es and car on her micro@@ blo@@ g , which is the Chin@@ ese version of T@@ wit@@ ter ."
And she cl@@ aim@@ ed to be the gener@@ al man@@ ager of R@@ ed C@@ ro@@ ss at the Ch@@ am@@ ber of Com@@ mer@@ ce .
"She didn &apos;t realiz@@ e that she st@@ ep@@ ped on a sen@@ si@@ tive ner@@ ve and ar@@ ous@@ ed national ques@@ tion@@ ing , almost a tur@@ mo@@ il , against the cre@@ di@@ bil@@ ity of R@@ ed C@@ ro@@ ss ."
"The contro@@ vers@@ y was so he@@ ated that the R@@ ed C@@ ro@@ ss had to open a pr@@ ess con@@ fer@@ ence to cl@@ ari@@ f@@ y it , and the investi@@ g@@ ation is going on ."
"So far , as of today , we know that she her@@ self made up that ti@@ tle — probably because she fe@@ els pr@@ oud to be associ@@ ated with char@@ ity ."
"A@@ ll those ex@@ pen@@ sive it@@ ems were given to her as gi@@ f@@ ts by her bo@@ y@@ friend , who used to be a bo@@ ard mem@@ ber in a sub@@ di@@ vision of R@@ ed C@@ ro@@ ss at Ch@@ am@@ ber of Com@@ mer@@ ce ."
It &apos;s very compl@@ ic@@ ated to expl@@ ain .
"But any@@ way , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it ."
It is still bo@@ il@@ ing .
"It shows us a gener@@ al mis@@ tr@@ ust of government or govern@@ ment@@ -@@ b@@ ac@@ ked institutions , which l@@ ac@@ ked trans@@ par@@ ency in the past ."
And also it sho@@ wed us the power and the impact of social media as micro@@ blo@@ g .
"M@@ icro@@ blo@@ g bo@@ om@@ ed in the year of 20@@ 10 , with vis@@ it@@ ors dou@@ bl@@ ed and time spent on it tri@@ pl@@ ed ."
"S@@ in@@ a@@ .@@ co@@ m , a maj@@ or news port@@ al , alone has more than 1@@ 40 million micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ers ."
"On T@@ enc@@ ent , 200 million ."
"The most popul@@ ar blo@@ gg@@ er — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a mo@@ vie st@@ ar , and she has more than 9@@ .@@ 5 million fol@@ low@@ ers , or f@@ ans ."
"A@@ bout 80 percent of those micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ers are young people , under 30 years old ."
"And because , as you know , the tradi@@ tional media is still he@@ av@@ ily contr@@ oll@@ ed by the government , social media off@@ ers an op@@ en@@ ing to let the st@@ ea@@ m out a little bit ."
"But because you don &apos;t have many other op@@ en@@ ings , the he@@ at coming out of this op@@ en@@ ing is sometimes very str@@ ong , active and even viol@@ ent ."
"So through micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ing , we are able to understand Chin@@ ese y@@ ou@@ th even better ."
So how are they different ?
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , most of them were born in the 8@@ 0s and 9@@ 0s , under the on@@ e-@@ child poli@@ cy ."
"And because of sel@@ ected abor@@ tion by famil@@ ies who fav@@ o@@ red bo@@ ys to gir@@ ls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women ."
"That could pose a potenti@@ al d@@ anger to the society , but who kno@@ ws ; we &apos;re in a glob@@ aliz@@ ed world , so they can look for gir@@ l@@ friends from other countries ."
Mo@@ st of them have fai@@ r@@ ly good education .
The ill@@ it@@ er@@ acy r@@ ate in China am@@ ong this gener@@ ation is under one percent .
"In cities , 80 percent of kids go to colle@@ ge ."
"But they are fac@@ ing an ag@@ ing China with a population abo@@ ve 6@@ 5 years old coming up with s@@ ev@@ en-@@ poin@@ t-@@ some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 20@@ 30 ."
"And you know we have the tradi@@ tion that youn@@ ger gener@@ ations support the el@@ ders financi@@ ally , and taking care of them when they &apos;re s@@ ick ."
So it means young cou@@ ples will have to support four parents who have a life exp@@ ect@@ anc@@ y of 7@@ 3 years old .
So making a living is not that easy for young people .
C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge grad@@ u@@ ates are not in sh@@ ort suppl@@ y .
"In urb@@ an areas , colle@@ ge grad@@ u@@ ates find the starting sal@@ ary is about 4@@ 00 U.S. dollars a mon@@ th , while the average rent is abo@@ ve $ 500 ."
"So what do they do ? They have to share space — squ@@ e@@ e@@ zed in very lim@@ ited space to s@@ ave money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tri@@ be of ants . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get mar@@ ried and buy their ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment , they figu@@ red out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to aff@@ or@@ d their first ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment ."
"That r@@ ati@@ o in America would only cost a couple five years to ear@@ n , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the sk@@ y@@ ro@@ ck@@ eting real est@@ ate pr@@ ice ."
"A@@ mon@@ g the 200 million mi@@ gr@@ ant wor@@ kers , 60 percent of them are young people ."
They find themselves sort of s@@ and@@ wi@@ ched between the urb@@ an areas and the r@@ ural areas .
"M@@ o@@ st of them don &apos;t want to go back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , but they don &apos;t have the sense of bel@@ ong@@ ing ."
"They work for longer hours with less in@@ come , less social w@@ el@@ f@@ are ."
"And they &apos;re more v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able to job lo@@ s@@ ses , subj@@ ect to in@@ fl@@ ation , ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing lo@@ ans from ban@@ ks , ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of the ren@@ min@@ b@@ i , or dec@@ line of dem@@ and from Europe or America for the produc@@ ts they produce ."
"L@@ ast year , though , an app@@ all@@ ing in@@ cident in a sou@@ ther@@ n O@@ E@@ M man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ r@@ ing com@@ pou@@ nd in China : 1@@ 3 young wor@@ kers in their l@@ ate te@@ ens and early 20@@ s comm@@ it@@ ted su@@ ici@@ de , just one by one like caus@@ ing a cont@@ ag@@ ious disease ."
But they died because of all different pers@@ onal reas@@ ons .
"But this whole in@@ cident ar@@ ous@@ ed a huge out@@ cr@@ y from society about the is@@ ol@@ ation , both physical and mental , of these mi@@ gr@@ ant wor@@ kers ."
"For those who do re@@ turn back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , they find themselves very w@@ el@@ come loc@@ ally , because with the knowledge , sk@@ ills and net@@ works they have learned in the cities , with the ass@@ ist@@ ance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more j@@ ob@@ s , up@@ gr@@ ade local agricul@@ ture and create new business in the less developed market ."
"So for the past few years , the co@@ as@@ t@@ al areas , they found themselves in a sh@@ or@@ t@@ age of lab@@ or ."
These di@@ agr@@ ams show a more gener@@ al social back@@ ground .
"The first one is the En@@ g@@ els co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent , which expl@@ ains that the cost of d@@ ai@@ ly nec@@ essi@@ ties has dro@@ p@@ ped its per@@ cent@@ age all through the past dec@@ ade , in terms of family in@@ come , to about 3@@ 7@@ -@@ some percent ."
"But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 3@@ 9 percent , in@@ dic@@ ating a ris@@ ing living cost ."
The G@@ in@@ i co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent has already pass@@ ed the danger@@ ous line of 0@@ .@@ 4 .
Now it &apos;s 0@@ .@@ 5 — even wor@@ se than that in America — sho@@ wing us the in@@ come in@@ equ@@ ality .
And so you see this whole society getting fr@@ ustr@@ ated about lo@@ sing some of its mo@@ bil@@ ity .
"And also , the b@@ it@@ tern@@ ess and even res@@ ent@@ ment to@@ wards the r@@ ich and the powerful is quite wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ."
So any acc@@ us@@ ations of cor@@ ru@@ ption or back@@ do@@ or de@@ al@@ ings between auth@@ ori@@ ties or business would ar@@ ou@@ se a social out@@ cr@@ y or even un@@ rest .
"So through some of the h@@ ot@@ test t@@ op@@ ics on micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ing , we can see what young people care most about ."
So@@ cial justice and government ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability r@@ uns the first in what they dem@@ and .
"For the past dec@@ ade or so , a mas@@ sive ur@@ ban@@ iz@@ ation and develop@@ ment have let us wit@@ ness a lot of re@@ ports on the forc@@ ed demo@@ li@@ tion of priv@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ty ."
And it has ar@@ ous@@ ed huge anger and fr@@ ustr@@ ation am@@ ong our young gener@@ ation .
"S@@ ome@@ times people get kill@@ ed , and sometimes people set themselves on fi@@ re to prot@@ est ."
"So when these in@@ cid@@ ents are re@@ por@@ ted more and more fre@@ qu@@ ently on the Internet , people cr@@ y for the government to take actions to stop this ."
"So the good news is that ear@@ li@@ er this year , the state coun@@ c@@ il pass@@ ed a new reg@@ ul@@ ation on house re@@ qu@@ is@@ ition and demo@@ li@@ tion and pass@@ ed the right to order forc@@ ed demo@@ li@@ tion from local govern@@ ments to the cour@@ t ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , many other issu@@ es concer@@ ning public s@@ af@@ ety is a ho@@ t t@@ op@@ ic on the Internet ."
"We heard about pol@@ lu@@ ted air , pol@@ lu@@ ted water , po@@ is@@ on@@ ed food ."
"And gu@@ ess what , we have fa@@ ked be@@ ef ."
"They have sor@@ ts of in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that you br@@ ush on a piece of ch@@ ic@@ ken or fish , and it turns it to look like be@@ ef ."
"And then l@@ ately , people are very concer@@ ned about co@@ o@@ king oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; re@@ fin@@ ing &#93; co@@ o@@ king oil from rest@@ aur@@ ant s@@ lo@@ p ."
So all these things have ar@@ ous@@ ed a huge out@@ cr@@ y from the Internet .
"And for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , we have seen the government respon@@ ding more tim@@ ely and also more fre@@ qu@@ ently to the public concer@@ ns ."
"Wh@@ ile young people se@@ em to be very sure about their particip@@ ation in public poli@@ cy@@ -@@ making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their pers@@ onal life ."
China is so@@ on to pas@@ s the U.S.
as the number one market for lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y br@@ ands — that &apos;s not inclu@@ ding the Chin@@ ese ex@@ pend@@ itures in Europe and el@@ se@@ where .
"But you know what , half of those con@@ sum@@ ers are ear@@ ning a sal@@ ary bel@@ ow 2@@ ,000 U.S. dollars ."
They &apos;re not r@@ ich at all .
They &apos;re taking those b@@ ag@@ s and clo@@ th@@ es as a sense of identi@@ ty and social stat@@ us .
And this is a girl expl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly saying on a T@@ V d@@ ating show that she would rather cr@@ y in a B@@ M@@ W than s@@ mi@@ le on a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
"But of course , we do have young people who would still pre@@ f@@ er to s@@ mi@@ le , whether in a B@@ M@@ W or &#91; on &#93; a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle ."
"So in the next picture , you see a very popul@@ ar ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called &quot; &quot; n@@ a@@ ked &quot; &quot; we@@ d@@ ding , or &quot; &quot; n@@ a@@ ked &quot; &quot; mar@@ ri@@ age ."
"It does not mean they will w@@ ear nothing in the we@@ d@@ ding , but it shows that these young cou@@ ples are ready to get mar@@ ried without a house , without a car , without a di@@ am@@ ond r@@ ing and without a we@@ d@@ ding ban@@ qu@@ et , to show their comm@@ it@@ ment to true love ."
"And also , people are doing good through social media ."
And the first picture sho@@ wed us that a truc@@ k c@@ ag@@ ing 500 hom@@ el@@ ess and k@@ id@@ n@@ app@@ ed do@@ gs for food proc@@ ess@@ ing was spo@@ t@@ ted and st@@ op@@ ped on the high@@ way with the whole country wat@@ ching through micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ing .
"P@@ eople were don@@ ating money , do@@ g food and off@@ ering vol@@ un@@ te@@ er work to stop that truc@@ k ."
"And after hours of ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation , 500 do@@ gs were res@@ cu@@ ed ."
And here also people are hel@@ ping to find m@@ iss@@ ing children .
A father pos@@ ted his son &apos;s picture on@@ to the Internet .
"A@@ f@@ ter thousands of res@@ ends in rel@@ ay , the child was found , and we wit@@ n@@ essed the re@@ uni@@ on of the family through micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ing ."
So happ@@ iness is the most popul@@ ar word we have heard through the past two years .
"H@@ app@@ iness is not only rel@@ ated to pers@@ onal experi@@ ences and pers@@ onal val@@ ues , but also , it &apos;s about the environment ."
P@@ eople are thinking about the fol@@ lo@@ wing questions : A@@ re we going to sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce our environment fur@@ ther to produce high@@ er G@@ D@@ P ?
"H@@ ow are we going to per@@ form our social and political re@@ form to keep p@@ ace with economic growth , to keep sust@@ ain@@ ability and st@@ ability ?"
"And also , how capable is the system of self-@@ correc@@ t@@ ness to keep more people cont@@ ent with all sor@@ ts of fr@@ ic@@ tion going on at the same time ?"
I gu@@ ess these are the questions people are going to answer .
And our youn@@ ger gener@@ ation are going to trans@@ form this country while at the same time being transform@@ ed themselves .
Thank you very much .

"@@ Y@@ our life as a complex human being is re@@ plac@@ ed by medic@@ al data : Y@@ our images , your exam@@ s , your la@@ b val@@ ues , a l@@ ist of medic@@ ines ."
D@@ oc@@ tors start spea@@ king a language which you don &apos;t understand .
They start poin@@ ting their fin@@ g@@ ers at your body and your images .
"P@@ eople start changing as well because they start de@@ al@@ ing with the disease , instead of with the human being ."
C@@ an I study ? C@@ an I make love ? C@@ an I be cre@@ ative ?
"And you won@@ der , &quot; &quot; What have I done to des@@ er@@ ve this ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I change something about my li@@ f@@ es@@ ty@@ le ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I do something ?"
"But they also are very used to having to deal with patients , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes lo@@ se the idea that this is tor@@ ture for you and that you become , literally , a patient — &quot; patient &quot; means &quot; the one who w@@ ai@@ ts . &quot;"
"But instead , you &apos;re forc@@ ed there to w@@ ait in the hands of a ser@@ ies of very professi@@ onal str@@ ang@@ ers ."
"It was really hard to ob@@ t@@ ain , because it &apos;s not common pr@@ acti@@ ce to ask for a picture of your own cancer ."
"I tal@@ ked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me ."
There &apos;s more to me .
"A cu@@ re , wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever it is , will have to deal with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the hosp@@ ital against medic@@ al ad@@ vi@@ ce ."
I was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to change my relation@@ ship with the cancer and I was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as dr@@ as@@ tic as a sur@@ g@@ ery .
"I &apos;m an arti@@ st , I use s@@ ever@@ al form@@ s of op@@ en-@@ source technologies and open information in my pr@@ acti@@ ce ."
"So my best b@@ et was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be acc@@ essed by any@@ one ."
"So I created a we@@ b@@ site , which is called La C@@ ur@@ a , on which I put my medic@@ al data , on@@ line ."
I actually had to h@@ ack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another spe@@ ech .
"( Laughter ) I chose this word , La C@@ ur@@ a — La C@@ ur@@ a in I@@ tal@@ ian means &quot; &quot; the cu@@ re &quot; &quot; — because in many different cul@@ tures , the word &quot; &quot; cu@@ re &quot; &quot; can mean many different things ."
"In our W@@ es@@ tern cul@@ tures , it means er@@ a@@ dic@@ ating or re@@ vers@@ ing a disease , but in different cul@@ tures , for example , a culture from A@@ si@@ a , from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an , from L@@ ati@@ n countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things ."
"O@@ f course , I was interested in the op@@ in@@ ions of doc@@ tors and heal@@ th@@ care provi@@ ders , but I was also interested in the cu@@ re of the arti@@ st , of the po@@ et , of the design@@ er , of , who kno@@ ws , the mus@@ ici@@ ans ."
"I was interested in the social cu@@ re , I was interested in the psycho@@ log@@ ical cu@@ re , I was interested in the spir@@ itu@@ al cu@@ re , I was interested in the emo@@ tional cu@@ re , I was interested in any form of cu@@ re ."
"And , it worked ."
The La C@@ ur@@ a we@@ b@@ site went vir@@ al .
"I re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed lots of media attention from I@@ tal@@ y and from ab@@ ro@@ ad and I quickly re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed more than 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 cont@@ ac@@ ts — em@@ ails , social net@@ working — most of them were a sugg@@ es@@ tion on how to cu@@ re my cancer , but more of them were about how to cu@@ re myself as a full individual ."
"For example , many thousands of vide@@ os , images , pic@@ tures , art performan@@ ces were produc@@ ed for La C@@ ur@@ a ."
"For example , here we see Fr@@ anc@@ esc@@ a F@@ in@@ i in her performan@@ ce ."
"O@@ r , as arti@@ st P@@ a@@ tr@@ ick Li@@ ch@@ ty has done : He produc@@ ed a 3@@ D s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture of my tu@@ mo@@ r and put it on s@@ ale on Th@@ in@@ gi@@ verse ."
"And together , we were able to form a strat@@ e@@ gy for my own cu@@ re in many langu@@ ages , ac@@ cor@@ ding to many cul@@ tures ."
"And the cur@@ rent strat@@ e@@ gy sp@@ ans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite re@@ mark@@ able for me ."
"@@ &#91; S@@ ur@@ g@@ ery &#93; The fol@@ low@@ -@@ up M@@ R@@ I@@ s sho@@ wed , l@@ uc@@ kil@@ y , little to no growth of the cancer ."
So I was able to take my time and cho@@ ose .
"I chose the doc@@ tor I wanted to work with , I chose the hosp@@ ital I wanted to st@@ ay in , and in the me@@ an@@ while , I was sup@@ por@@ ted by thousands of people , n@@ one of wh@@ om felt p@@ ity for me ."
What are the out@@ comes ?
"I &apos;m f@@ ine , as you can see , pretty f@@ ine ."
I have completely changed my life and my li@@ f@@ es@@ ty@@ le .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing I did was thou@@ gh@@ t@@ fully design@@ ed to get me engag@@ ed .
"@@ U@@ p until the very last few minutes of the sur@@ g@@ ery , which was very inten@@ se , a ma@@ tri@@ x of el@@ ec@@ tro@@ des was im@@ plan@@ ted in my brain from this side , to be able to build a func@@ tional ma@@ p of what the brain contr@@ ols ."
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , there were ."
&#91; O@@ p@@ en &#93; And this op@@ enn@@ ess was really the fundament@@ al part of La C@@ ur@@ a .
"Th@@ ou@@ sands of people shar@@ ed their stories , their experi@@ ences ."
D@@ oc@@ tors got to talk with people they don &apos;t usu@@ ally con@@ sul@@ t when they think about cancer .
"I &apos;m a self-@@ f@@ oun@@ ding , continu@@ ous state of trans@@ l@@ ation am@@ ong many different langu@@ ages , in which science me@@ ets emo@@ tion and conv@@ enti@@ onal research me@@ ets tradi@@ tional research ."
&#91; So@@ ci@@ ety &#93; The most important thing of La C@@ ur@@ a was to feel like a part of a really engag@@ ed and conn@@ ected society wh@@ ose w@@ ell@@ ness really depend@@ s on the w@@ ell@@ ness of all of its com@@ pon@@ ents .
This global performan@@ ce is my op@@ en-@@ source cu@@ re for cancer .
"And from what I feel , it &apos;s a cu@@ re for me , but for us all ."
Thank you .

"A big challenge is , how should the i@@ P@@ a@@ ds be used , and what app@@ s should we put on the i@@ P@@ a@@ ds ?"

"( F@@ l@@ our@@ ish ...

( Laughter )"
"M@@ ay@@ be we &apos;ll go into the next t@@ une , because I tot@@ ally lost where this is going ."

"( Music ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are com@@ mon@@ ly asked ; there are so many ."
"And ... Well , I gu@@ ess I could tell you a little of the history of the ther@@ em@@ in ."
"It was invent@@ ed around the 19@@ 20@@ s , and the invent@@ or , L@@ é@@ on Th@@ er@@ em@@ in — he also was a mus@@ ici@@ an bes@@ i@@ des an invent@@ or — he came up with the idea for making the ther@@ em@@ in , I think , when he was working on some sh@@ or@@ tw@@ ave radi@@ os ."

"And a lot of times , even kids no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , they &apos;ll make re@@ fer@@ ence to a ther@@ em@@ in by going , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ oo@@ -@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 5@@ 0s it was used in the sci@@ -@@ f@@ i hor@@ ro@@ r mo@@ vies , that sound that &apos;s like ...

"And sometimes if I have too much co@@ ff@@ ee , then my vi@@ br@@ a@@ to gets out of hand ."
You &apos;re really sen@@ si@@ tive to your body and its func@@ tions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
You have to st@@ ay so still if you want to have the most control .
"It re@@ min@@ ds me of the bal@@ anc@@ ing act ear@@ li@@ er on — what Mi@@ cha@@ el was doing — because you &apos;re fi@@ gh@@ ting so hard to keep the bal@@ ance with what you &apos;re pl@@ aying with and st@@ ay in t@@ une , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to foc@@ us so much on being in t@@ une all the time ; you want to be feeling the music ."
"And then also , you &apos;re trying to st@@ ay very , very , very still because little mo@@ v@@ ements with other parts of your body will aff@@ ect the p@@ it@@ ch , or sometimes if you &apos;re hol@@ ding a low n@@ ote — ( T@@ one ris@@ ing out of key ) — and brea@@ thing will make it ..."
( Laughter ) If I pas@@ s out on the next s@@ ong ... ( Laughter )
"I think of it almost like like a y@@ o@@ g@@ a in@@ stru@@ ment because it makes you so aw@@ are of every little cr@@ az@@ y thing your body is doing , or just aw@@ are of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re pl@@ aying ; you don &apos;t want to have any sudd@@ en mo@@ v@@ ements ."

It has been 1@@ 2@@ 8 years since the last country in the world ab@@ ol@@ ished sl@@ av@@ ery and 5@@ 3 years since M@@ arti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing pr@@ on@@ oun@@ c@@ ed his &quot; &quot; I H@@ ave A D@@ re@@ am &quot; &quot; spe@@ ech .
"But we still live in a world where the colo@@ r of our sk@@ in not only gi@@ ves a first impression , but a l@@ as@@ ting one that re@@ mains ."
I was born in a family full of col@@ ors .
My father is the son of a m@@ aid from wh@@ om he in@@ her@@ ited an inten@@ se dar@@ k cho@@ col@@ ate t@@ one .
He was adop@@ ted by those who I know as my grand@@ parents .
"The ma@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch , my grand@@ ma , has a por@@ cel@@ ain sk@@ in and cot@@ t@@ on-@@ like h@@ air ."
"My mother is a cin@@ nam@@ on-@@ sk@@ in d@@ aughter of a n@@ ative B@@ ra@@ z@@ ili@@ an , with a p@@ in@@ ch of h@@ az@@ el and hon@@ ey , and a man &#91; who is &#93; a mi@@ x of co@@ ff@@ ee with mil@@ k , but with a lot of co@@ ff@@ ee ."
She has two s@@ is@@ ters .
"One in a to@@ as@@ te@@ d-@@ pe@@ an@@ ut sk@@ in and the other , also adop@@ ted , more on the be@@ ig@@ e side , like a p@@ anc@@ ake ."
"( Laughter ) G@@ ro@@ wing up in this family , colo@@ r was never important for me ."
"O@@ u@@ t@@ side home , ho@@ w@@ ever , things were different so@@ on ."
C@@ olo@@ r had many other me@@ an@@ ings .
I remember my first dra@@ wing l@@ ess@@ ons in school as a b@@ unch of con@@ tra@@ dic@@ t@@ ory fe@@ el@@ ings .
It was exc@@ iting and cre@@ ative but I never underst@@ ood the unique fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ colo@@ red pen@@ c@@ il .
I was made of fl@@ es@@ h but I wasn &apos;t p@@ ink .
"My sk@@ in was bro@@ wn , and people said I was black ."
I was seven years old with a m@@ ess of col@@ ors in my head .
"L@@ ater , when I took my cou@@ s@@ in to school , I was usu@@ ally taken for the n@@ ann@@ y ."
"B@@ y hel@@ ping in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en at a friend &apos;s par@@ ty , people thought I was the m@@ aid ."
I was even tre@@ ated like a pro@@ stitu@@ te just because I was wal@@ king alone on the be@@ ach with Euro@@ pe@@ an friends .
"And many times , vis@@ iting my grand@@ ma or friends in up@@ per clas@@ s buil@@ dings , I was inv@@ ited not to use the main el@@ ev@@ ator ."
"Because in the end , with this colo@@ r and this h@@ air , I cannot bel@@ ong to some places ."
"In some way , I get to used to it and accep@@ t part of it ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , something inside of me ke@@ e@@ ps re@@ vol@@ ving and stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing ."
Y@@ ear@@ s later I mar@@ ried a S@@ pan@@ i@@ ard .
But not any S@@ pan@@ i@@ ard .
I chose one with the sk@@ in colo@@ r of a lo@@ b@@ st@@ er when su@@ n@@ bur@@ n@@ t .
"( Laughter ) S@@ in@@ ce then , a new question started to cha@@ se me ."
What will be the colo@@ r of your children ?
"But thinking about it , with my pre@@ vi@@ ous back@@ ground , my story led me to make my pers@@ onal ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise as a photograp@@ her ."
And that is how H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e was born .
"H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e is a pur@@ su@@ it to high@@ light our true col@@ ors , rather than the un@@ true white , red , black or y@@ el@@ low associ@@ ated with r@@ ace ."
It &apos;s a kind of game to question our co@@ des .
It &apos;s a work in progr@@ ess from a pers@@ onal story to a global history .
I por@@ tr@@ ay the subj@@ ects in a white back@@ ground .
"Th@@ en I cho@@ ose an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ pi@@ x@@ el squ@@ are from the no@@ se , pain@@ t the back@@ ground , and look for the cor@@ respon@@ ding colo@@ r in the industri@@ al pal@@ ette , P@@ ant@@ one ."
"I started with my family and friends , then more and more people jo@@ in@@ ed the ad@@ ven@@ ture , th@@ an@@ ks to public call@@ s coming through the social media ."
I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open concept that inv@@ ites everybody to p@@ ush the share bu@@ t@@ ton in both the computer and their brain .
The s@@ no@@ w@@ ball started to ro@@ ll .
"The project had a great w@@ el@@ come — inv@@ it@@ ations , ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions , physical form@@ ats , g@@ all@@ er@@ ies and mus@@ eu@@ ms ..."
just happened .
"And am@@ ong them , my favor@@ ite : when H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e occu@@ pi@@ es public sp@@ aces and appe@@ ars in the stre@@ et , it fo@@ st@@ ers a popul@@ ar de@@ b@@ ate and cre@@ ates a feeling of community ."
"I have por@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed more than 3@@ ,000 people in 1@@ 3 different countries , 1@@ 9 different cities around the world ."
"J@@ ust to men@@ tion some of them — from someone inclu@@ ded in the F@@ or@@ bes l@@ ist , to re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es who cro@@ ss@@ ed the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an by bo@@ at ."
"In Par@@ is , from the U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O H@@ ea@@ d@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters to a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
And students both in S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land and fav@@ el@@ as in Ri@@ o de J@@ an@@ e@@ ir@@ o .
"A@@ ll kinds of beli@@ e@@ fs , g@@ end@@ er identi@@ ties or physical imp@@ air@@ ments , a ne@@ w@@ born or termin@@ ally ill ."
We all together build H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e .
Th@@ ose por@@ trai@@ ts make us re@@ think how we see each other .
"When moder@@ n science is ques@@ tion@@ ing the r@@ ace concept , what does it mean for us to be black , white , y@@ el@@ low , red ?"
"I@@ s it the ey@@ e , the no@@ se , the mou@@ th , the h@@ air ?"
"O@@ r does it have to do with our orig@@ in , n@@ ation@@ ality or b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t ?"
This pers@@ onal ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise turned out to be a disco@@ very .
Su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I realized that H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e was us@@ e@@ ful for many people .
It repres@@ ents a sort of mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r for those who cannot find themselves re@@ fl@@ ected in any lab@@ el .
It was amazing that people started to share their thou@@ ghts about the work with me .
"I have hundreds of that , I will share with you , too ."
"A mother of 11 years — A mother of an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl wr@@ ote me , &quot; &quot; V@@ ery good for me as a to@@ ol to work on her confi@@ d@@ ence , as this past wee@@ k@@ end one of her gir@@ l@@ friends ar@@ gu@@ ed with her that she does not bel@@ ong and should not be al@@ lowed to live in Nor@@ way ."
"So your work has a very spec@@ ial place in my heart and it &apos;s very important for me . &quot; &quot; A woman shar@@ ed her por@@ tr@@ ait on F@@ ace@@ book and wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; All my life , people from across the glo@@ be had difficul@@ ties to place me in a group , a st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe , a box ."
P@@ er@@ haps we should stop .
"I &apos;m a D@@ om@@ in@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ D@@ u@@ t@@ ch , I gre@@ w up in a mi@@ x@@ ed family and I &apos;m a b@@ is@@ ex@@ u@@ al woman . &apos; &quot; &quot; B@@ es@@ i@@ des these un@@ exp@@ ected and tou@@ ching re@@ actions , H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e fin@@ ds a new life in a different vari@@ ety of fiel@@ ds ."
"J@@ ust to show you some exam@@ ples , ill@@ ustr@@ at@@ ors and art students using it as a re@@ fer@@ ence for their sk@@ et@@ ches and their stu@@ dies ."
It &apos;s a coll@@ ection of fac@@ es .
"R@@ es@@ ear@@ chers in the fiel@@ ds of an@@ thro@@ po@@ lo@@ gy , phys@@ ics and neuro@@ science use H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e with different scientifi@@ c appro@@ ach@@ es rel@@ ated to human e@@ th@@ n@@ ic@@ ity , op@@ t@@ op@@ hy@@ si@@ olo@@ gy , face recogni@@ tion or Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s ."
"One of the most important imp@@ ac@@ ts of the project is that H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e was cho@@ s@@ en to be the co@@ ver of F@@ ore@@ ign A@@ ff@@ ai@@ rs , one of the most rel@@ ev@@ ant political public@@ ations ."
"And talking about fore@@ ign aff@@ ai@@ rs , I found the perf@@ ect am@@ b@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors for my project ..."
tea@@ chers .
They are the ones that use H@@ um@@ an@@ a@@ e as a to@@ ol for e@@ duc@@ ational pur@@ pos@@ es .
"Th@@ e@@ ir pas@@ sion encour@@ ages me to go back to dra@@ wing clas@@ ses , but this time as a tea@@ cher myself ."
"My students , both adul@@ ts and kids , pain@@ t their self-@@ por@@ trai@@ ts , trying to disco@@ ver their own unique colo@@ r ."
"As a photograp@@ her , I realiz@@ e that I can be a chan@@ ne@@ l for others to commun@@ ic@@ ate ."
"As an individual , as An@@ g@@ é@@ lic@@ a , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sitting in front of a ther@@ ap@@ ist ."
"A@@ ll the fr@@ ustr@@ ation , fear and lon@@ el@@ iness that I once felt ..."
be@@ comes love .
"The last country — the last country in the world who ab@@ ol@@ ished sl@@ av@@ ery is the country where I was born , B@@ ra@@ z@@ il ."
"That re@@ mains a common pr@@ acti@@ ce wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de , and that will not dis@@ app@@ ear by itself ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
I &apos;m very for@@ tun@@ ate to be here .
I feel so for@@ tun@@ ate .
I &apos;ve been so im@@ pr@@ essed by the k@@ ind@@ ness ex@@ pr@@ essed to me .
"I called my wi@@ fe L@@ es@@ lie , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good ."
It fe@@ els like I &apos;ve land@@ ed in a col@@ on@@ y of ang@@ els . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true feeling .
But let me get to the talk — I see the c@@ loc@@ k is run@@ ning .
"I &apos;m a public school tea@@ cher , and I just want to share a story of my super@@ int@@ end@@ ent ."
"H@@ er name is P@@ am M@@ or@@ an in Al@@ b@@ em@@ ar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty , V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , the fo@@ o@@ th@@ ills of the B@@ lu@@ e Ri@@ dge M@@ oun@@ t@@ ains ."
And she &apos;s a very high@@ -@@ t@@ ech super@@ int@@ end@@ ent .
"She uses smar@@ t bo@@ ards , she blo@@ gs , she T@@ we@@ ets , she does F@@ ace@@ book , she does all this sort of high@@ -@@ t@@ ech stuff ."
She &apos;s a technology lea@@ der and in@@ struc@@ tional lea@@ der .
"But in her off@@ ice , there &apos;s this old w@@ oo@@ den , wea@@ ther@@ -@@ wor@@ n table , k@@ it@@ ch@@ en table — pe@@ eling green pain@@ t , it &apos;s kind of r@@ ick@@ ety ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ am , you &apos;re such a moder@@ n , cu@@ t@@ t@@ ing@@ -@@ ed@@ ge person ."
"Wh@@ y is this old table in your off@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I gre@@ w up in Sou@@ th@@ w@@ es@@ tern V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , in the co@@ al min@@ es and the f@@ arm@@ l@@ ands of r@@ ural V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , and this table was in my grand@@ father &apos;s k@@ it@@ ch@@ en ."
"And we &apos;d come in from pl@@ aying , he &apos;d come in from pl@@ o@@ wing and working , and we &apos;d s@@ it around that table every night ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , I heard so much knowledge and so many in@@ si@@ ghts and so much w@@ is@@ dom come out around this table , I began to call it the w@@ is@@ dom table ."
"And when he pass@@ ed on , I took this table with me and brought it to my off@@ ice , and it re@@ min@@ ds me of him ."
"It re@@ min@@ ds me of what goes on around an emp@@ ty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the World P@@ ea@@ ce G@@ ame , and essenti@@ ally it is also an emp@@ ty space ."
"And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 2@@ 1@@ st century w@@ is@@ dom table , really ."
It all started back in 19@@ 7@@ 7 .
"I was a young man , and I had been dro@@ p@@ ping in and out of colle@@ ge ."
"And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing inter@@ m@@ it@@ tent so@@ jour@@ ns to India on a my@@ s@@ tical qu@@ est ."
"And I remember the last time I came back from India — in my long white flo@@ wing ro@@ bes and my big be@@ ard and my John L@@ enn@@ on gl@@ as@@ ses — and I said to my father , &quot; D@@ ad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spir@@ itu@@ al en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , d@@ ad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they pl@@ ea@@ ded with me to get a de@@ gre@@ e in something ."
So I got a de@@ gre@@ e and it turned out to be education .
It was an experim@@ ent@@ al education program .
"It could have been d@@ enti@@ str@@ y , but the word &quot; &quot; experim@@ ent@@ al &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for ."
"And I went in for a job inter@@ view in the Ri@@ ch@@ mon@@ d P@@ u@@ bli@@ c S@@ cho@@ ols in V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , the cap@@ ital city , bou@@ ght a thre@@ e-@@ piece su@@ it — my conc@@ ession to con@@ vention — ke@@ pt my long be@@ ard and my a@@ fr@@ o and my plat@@ form sho@@ es — at the time it was the &apos; 7@@ 0s — and I wal@@ ked in , and I s@@ at down and had an inter@@ view ."
"And I gu@@ ess they were hard up for tea@@ chers because the super@@ vis@@ or , her name was An@@ n@@ a Ar@@ o , said I had the job tea@@ ching gi@@ f@@ ted children ."
"And I was so sh@@ oc@@ ked , so st@@ un@@ ned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , th@@ ank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) G@@ i@@ f@@ ted education h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t really taken hold too much ."
There wer@@ en &apos;t really many mater@@ i@@ als or things to use .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer sh@@ oc@@ ked me . It st@@ un@@ ned me ."
H@@ er answer set the t@@ empl@@ ate for the entire care@@ er I was to have after that .
"She said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question c@@ lear@@ ed the space ."
"There was no program direc@@ tive , no man@@ u@@ al to fol@@ low , no stand@@ ards in gi@@ f@@ ted education in that way ."
"And she c@@ lear@@ ed such a space that I end@@ e@@ av@@ o@@ red from then on to clear a space for my students , an emp@@ ty space , wh@@ er@@ e@@ by they could create and make me@@ an@@ ing out of their own understanding ."
"So this happened in 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and I was tea@@ ching many years later , and a friend of mine intro@@ duc@@ ed me to a young fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker ."
H@@ is name is Chr@@ is F@@ ar@@ in@@ a .
Chr@@ is F@@ ar@@ in@@ a is here today at his own cost .
"Ch@@ r@@ is , could you st@@ and up and let them see you — a young , visi@@ on@@ ary fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker who &apos;s made a film ."
( Applause ) This film is called &quot; &quot; World P@@ ea@@ ce and O@@ ther 4@@ th G@@ ra@@ de A@@ chi@@ ev@@ ements . &quot; &quot; He pro@@ posed the film to me — it &apos;s a great ti@@ tle .
"He pro@@ posed the film to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local T@@ V , and we can say h@@ i to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the film has really gone places ."
"Now it &apos;s still in de@@ b@@ t , but Chr@@ is has man@@ ag@@ ed , through his own sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce , to get this film out ."
"So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one tea@@ cher ."
It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a t@@ est@@ am@@ ent to tea@@ ching and tea@@ chers .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
"And the str@@ ange thing is , when I watch the film — I have the e@@ erie sens@@ ation of seeing it — I saw myself literally dis@@ app@@ ear ."
What I saw was my tea@@ chers coming through me .
"I saw my ge@@ ome@@ try tea@@ cher in high school , M@@ r@@ . R@@ uc@@ ell &apos;s wr@@ y s@@ mi@@ le under his hand@@ le@@ b@@ ar mu@@ st@@ a@@ che ."
That &apos;s the s@@ mi@@ le I use — that &apos;s his s@@ mi@@ le .
I saw J@@ an P@@ ol@@ o &apos;s fl@@ ash@@ ing eyes .
"And they wer@@ en &apos;t fl@@ ash@@ ing in anger , they were fl@@ ash@@ ing in love , inten@@ se love for her students ."
And I have that kind of fl@@ ash sometimes .
And I saw M@@ is@@ s E@@ the@@ l J@@ . B@@ an@@ ks who w@@ o@@ re pe@@ ar@@ ls and high@@ -@@ he@@ els to el@@ ement@@ ary school every day .
"And you know , she had that ol@@ d-@@ school tea@@ cher st@@ are ."
You know the one .
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that tea@@ cher ?"
"I didn &apos;t use that st@@ are very often , but I do have it in my re@@ per@@ to@@ ire ."
And M@@ is@@ s B@@ an@@ ks was there as a great ment@@ or for me .
"And then I saw my own parents , my first tea@@ chers ."
"My father , very inv@@ enti@@ ve , sp@@ ati@@ al thin@@ ker ."
That &apos;s my bro@@ ther M@@ al@@ col@@ m there on the right .
"And my mother , who t@@ au@@ ght me in four@@ th gr@@ ade in se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated scho@@ ols in V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , who was my inspir@@ ation ."
"And really , I feel as though , when I see the film — I have a g@@ es@@ ture she does , like this — I feel like I am a continu@@ ation of her g@@ es@@ ture ."
I am one of her tea@@ ching g@@ es@@ tures .
"And the beautiful thing was , I got to te@@ ach my d@@ aughter in el@@ ement@@ ary school , M@@ ad@@ el@@ ine ."
And so that g@@ es@@ ture of my mother &apos;s contin@@ ues through many gener@@ ations .
It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lin@@ e@@ age .
And so I &apos;m here st@@ anding on the sh@@ oul@@ ders of many people .
I &apos;m not here alone .
There are many people on this stage right now .
And so this World P@@ ea@@ ce G@@ ame I &apos;d like to tell you about .
"It started out like this : it &apos;s just a four@@ -@@ fo@@ ot by fi@@ ve@@ -@@ fo@@ ot pl@@ y@@ w@@ ood bo@@ ard in an in@@ ner@@ -@@ city urb@@ an school , 19@@ 7@@ 8 ."
I was cre@@ ating a l@@ ess@@ on for students on Africa .
"We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them sol@@ ve it ."
I didn &apos;t want to lec@@ ture or have just book read@@ ing .
I wanted to have them be im@@ mer@@ s@@ ed and learn the feeling of learning through their bo@@ dies .
"So I thought , well they like to play gam@@ es ."
I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say inter@@ active ; we didn &apos;t have that ter@@ m in 19@@ 7@@ 8 — but something inter@@ active .
"And so we made the game , and it has since evol@@ ved to a four@@ -@@ fo@@ ot by four@@ -@@ fo@@ ot by four@@ -@@ fo@@ ot P@@ l@@ ex@@ ig@@ l@@ ass structure ."
And it has four P@@ l@@ ex@@ ig@@ l@@ ass l@@ ay@@ ers .
There &apos;s an ou@@ ter space l@@ ay@@ er with black ho@@ les and s@@ at@@ el@@ lit@@ es and research s@@ at@@ el@@ lit@@ es and as@@ ter@@ o@@ id min@@ ing .
"There &apos;s an air and space level with cl@@ ou@@ ds that are big pu@@ ff@@ s of cot@@ ton we p@@ ush around and terr@@ it@@ ori@@ al air sp@@ aces and air forces , a ground and se@@ a level with thousands of game pi@@ ec@@ es on it — even an under@@ se@@ a level with sub@@ mar@@ ines and under@@ se@@ a min@@ ing ."
There are four countries around the bo@@ ard .
The kids make up the nam@@ es of the countries — some are r@@ ich ; some are poor .
"They have different as@@ se@@ ts , commer@@ cial and milit@@ ary ."
And each country has a c@@ ab@@ in@@ et .
"There &apos;s a P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ister , S@@ ec@@ ret@@ ary of St@@ ate , M@@ in@@ ister of De@@ f@@ en@@ se and a C@@ F@@ O , or Com@@ p@@ tr@@ oll@@ er ."
I cho@@ ose the P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ister based on my relation@@ ship with them .
"I off@@ er them the job , they can turn it down , and then they cho@@ ose their own c@@ ab@@ in@@ et ."
"There &apos;s a World B@@ ank , ar@@ ms de@@ al@@ ers and a United N@@ ations ."
There &apos;s also a wea@@ ther go@@ dd@@ ess who contr@@ ols a ran@@ dom st@@ oc@@ k market and ran@@ dom wea@@ ther .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
And then there &apos;s a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ page cr@@ is@@ is do@@ cu@@ ment with 50 inter@@ loc@@ king problems .
"So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes ."
"I thro@@ w them into this complex ma@@ tri@@ x , and they tr@@ ust me because we have a de@@ ep , r@@ ich relation@@ ship together ."
"And so with all these cr@@ is@@ es , we have — let &apos;s see — e@@ th@@ ni@@ c and min@@ or@@ ity ten@@ sions ; we have chem@@ ical and nuc@@ l@@ ear sp@@ ills , nuc@@ l@@ ear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s oil sp@@ ills , environ@@ mental dis@@ as@@ ters , water ri@@ ghts dis@@ pu@@ tes , bre@@ ak@@ away re@@ public@@ s , fam@@ ine , end@@ anger@@ ed species and global w@@ arm@@ ing ."
"If A@@ l G@@ o@@ re is here , I &apos;m going to s@@ end my four@@ th@@ -@@ grad@@ ers from A@@ g@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t and V@@ en@@ able scho@@ ols to you because they sol@@ ved global w@@ arm@@ ing in a week ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it s@@ ever@@ al times too . ( Laughter )
"So I also have in the game a s@@ ab@@ ot@@ eur — some child — it &apos;s basically a trou@@ bl@@ em@@ ak@@ er — and I have my trou@@ bl@@ em@@ ak@@ er put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to s@@ ave the world and their position in the game ."
But they &apos;re also trying to under@@ mine everything in the game .
"And they do it sec@@ ret@@ ly through mis@@ information and ambi@@ gu@@ ities and ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ anci@@ es , trying to cause everyone to think more de@@ e@@ pl@@ y ."
"The s@@ ab@@ ot@@ eur is there , and we also read from S@@ un T@@ z@@ u &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Ar@@ t of W@@ ar . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ grad@@ ers understand it — n@@ ine years old — and they hand@@ le that and use that to understand how to , not fol@@ low — at first they do — the pa@@ ths to power and des@@ truc@@ tion , the pat@@ h to war ."
"They learn to over@@ look sh@@ or@@ t-@@ si@@ gh@@ ted re@@ actions and im@@ pul@@ sive thinking , to think in a long@@ -@@ ter@@ m , more conse@@ qu@@ enti@@ al way ."
"S@@ te@@ w@@ art Br@@ and is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a Co@@ E@@ volution Qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly artic@@ le on a p@@ ea@@ ce force ."
"And in the game , sometimes students actually form a p@@ ea@@ ce force ."
I &apos;m just a c@@ loc@@ k wat@@ cher .
I &apos;m just a cl@@ ari@@ fier . I &apos;m just a fac@@ il@@ it@@ ator .
The students run the game .
I have no chance to make any poli@@ cy what@@ so@@ ever once they start pl@@ aying .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
( V@@ ide@@ o ) Bo@@ y : The World P@@ ea@@ ce G@@ ame is ser@@ ious .
You &apos;re actually getting t@@ au@@ ght something like how to take care of the world .
"S@@ ee , M@@ r@@ . H@@ un@@ ter is doing that because he says his time has mess@@ ed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fi@@ x that problem ."
"@@ John H@@ un@@ ter : I off@@ ered them a — ( Applause ) A@@ c@@ tually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer ."
And I ad@@ m@@ it the tru@@ th to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
"And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to di@@ g up the answer ."
And so I a@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze to them as well .
"I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sor@@ ry , bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls , but the tru@@ th is we have left this world to you in such a s@@ ad and terri@@ ble sh@@ ape , and we hope you can fi@@ x it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a s@@ inc@@ ere a@@ po@@ lo@@ gy , and they take it very ser@@ i@@ ously ."
Now you may be wonder@@ ing what all this complex@@ ity looks like .
"Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see ."
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) J@@ H : All right , we &apos;re going into ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations as of now . G@@ o ."
"( Ch@@ at@@ ter ) J@@ H : My question to you is , who &apos;s in char@@ ge of that cl@@ ass@@ room ?"
It &apos;s a ser@@ ious question : who is really in char@@ ge ?
I &apos;ve learned to ce@@ de control of the cl@@ ass@@ room over to the students over time .
There &apos;s a tr@@ ust and an understanding and a de@@ dic@@ ation to an ide@@ al that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning tea@@ cher : control every conversation and respon@@ se in the cl@@ ass@@ room .
"It &apos;s impossible . Th@@ e@@ ir collec@@ tive w@@ is@@ dom is much gre@@ ater than mine , and I ad@@ m@@ it it to them op@@ en@@ ly ."
So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some mag@@ ical things that have happened .
"In this game we had a little girl , and she was the De@@ f@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ ister of the po@@ or@@ est n@@ ation ."
And the De@@ f@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ ister — she had the t@@ ank corps and A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce and so for@@ th .
"And she was next do@@ or to a very we@@ al@@ thy , o@@ il@@ -@@ r@@ ich neigh@@ b@@ or ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ out pro@@ vo@@ c@@ ation , sudd@@ en@@ ly she att@@ ac@@ ked , against her P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ister &apos;s or@@ ders , the n@@ ex@@ t-@@ do@@ or neigh@@ b@@ or &apos;s oil fiel@@ ds ."
"She mar@@ ched into the oil field res@@ er@@ ves , sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded it , without fir@@ ing a sho@@ t , and sec@@ u@@ red it and hel@@ d it ."
And that neigh@@ b@@ or was un@@ able to con@@ duc@@ t any milit@@ ary oper@@ ations because their fu@@ el suppl@@ y was loc@@ ked up .
"We were all up@@ set with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?"
"This is the World P@@ ea@@ ce G@@ ame . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at n@@ ine years old , she hel@@ d her pi@@ ec@@ es and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; T@@ o her gir@@ l@@ friends she said that ."
That &apos;s a bre@@ ach there .
"And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cro@@ ss a n@@ ine year-@@ old girl with t@@ an@@ ks ."
( Laughter ) They are the tou@@ gh@@ est op@@ pon@@ ents .
And we were very up@@ set .
I thought I was fai@@ ling as a tea@@ cher . Why would she do this ?
"But come to find out , a few game days later — and there are turns where we take ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation from a team — actually there &apos;s a ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation per@@ i@@ od with all te@@ ams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day ."
So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this maj@@ or country was pl@@ ann@@ ing a milit@@ ary off@@ en@@ sive to dom@@ in@@ ate the entire world .
"H@@ ad they had their fu@@ el suppl@@ ies , they would have done it ."
She was able to see the v@@ ect@@ ors and tr@@ end l@@ ines and inten@@ tions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a phil@@ os@@ oph@@ ical dec@@ ision to att@@ ack in a p@@ ea@@ ce game .
"Now she used a small war to aver@@ t a larg@@ er war , so we st@@ op@@ ped and had a very good phil@@ os@@ oph@@ ical discus@@ sion about whether that was right , condi@@ tional good , or not right ."
"That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situ@@ ations ."
I could not have design@@ ed that in tea@@ ching it .
It came about s@@ pon@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously through their collec@@ tive w@@ is@@ dom .
"( Applause ) A@@ no@@ ther example , a beautiful thing happened ."
We have a let@@ ter in the game .
"If you &apos;re a milit@@ ary comm@@ and@@ er and you w@@ age tro@@ op@@ s — the little plas@@ tic to@@ ys on the bo@@ ard — and you lo@@ se them , I put in a let@@ ter ."
You have to wr@@ ite a let@@ ter to their parents — the fic@@ tional parents of your fic@@ tional tro@@ op@@ s — expl@@ aining what happened and off@@ ering your con@@ d@@ ol@@ ences .
So you have a little bit more thought before you comm@@ it to comb@@ at .
"And so we had this situation come up — last sum@@ mer actually , at A@@ g@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t S@@ cho@@ ol in Al@@ b@@ em@@ ar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty — and one of our milit@@ ary comm@@ and@@ ers got up to read that let@@ ter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; M@@ r@@ . H@@ un@@ ter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a par@@ ent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a par@@ ent vis@@ iting that day , just sitting in the back of the room ."
&quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mo@@ m to read the let@@ ter .
"It &apos;ll be more re@@ al@@ er if she re@@ a@@ ds it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she gam@@ ely pic@@ ked up the let@@ ter ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ ure . &quot; &quot; She started read@@ ing . She read one sent@@ ence .
She read two sent@@ ences .
"B@@ y the third sent@@ ence , she was in t@@ ear@@ s ."
I was in t@@ ear@@ s .
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body underst@@ ood that when we lo@@ se somebody , the win@@ n@@ ers are not glo@@ ating ."
We all lo@@ se .
And it was an amazing oc@@ curr@@ ence and an amazing understanding .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend D@@ av@@ id says about this .
He &apos;s been in many b@@ att@@ les .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ av@@ id : We &apos;ve really had enough of people att@@ ac@@ king .
"I mean , we &apos;ve been l@@ uc@@ ky &#91; most of &#93; the time ."
But now I &apos;m feeling really we@@ ird because I &apos;m living what S@@ un T@@ z@@ u said one week .
"One week he said , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose who go into bat@@ tle and win will want to go back , and those who lo@@ se in bat@@ tle will want to go back and win . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been w@@ inning b@@ att@@ les , so I &apos;m going into b@@ att@@ les , more b@@ att@@ les ."
And I think it &apos;s sort of we@@ ird to be living what S@@ un T@@ z@@ u said .
J@@ H : I get ch@@ ills every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of engag@@ ement you want to have happen .
"And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that ."
But it &apos;s self-@@ ev@@ id@@ ent ass@@ ess@@ ment .
We know that &apos;s an auth@@ enti@@ c ass@@ ess@@ ment of learning .
"We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go be@@ y@@ ond data with the real tru@@ th of what &apos;s going on ."
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend B@@ ren@@ n@@ an .
"We had play@@ ed the game one s@@ ession after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essenti@@ ally sol@@ ved all 50 of the inter@@ loc@@ king cr@@ is@@ es ."
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be sol@@ ved and every country &apos;s ass@@ et value has to be increas@@ ed abo@@ ve its starting point .
"S@@ ome are poor , some are we@@ al@@ thy . There are bil@@ lions ."
The World B@@ ank pres@@ id@@ ent was a th@@ ir@@ d-@@ grad@@ er one time .
"He says , &quot; &quot; How many z@@ er@@ os in a tr@@ il@@ lion ? I &apos;ve got to calcul@@ ate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was s@@ etting f@@ is@@ c@@ al poli@@ cy in that game for high school play@@ ers who were pl@@ aying with him ."
So the team that was the po@@ or@@ est had g@@ ot@@ ten even po@@ orer .
There was no way they could win .
"And we were appro@@ ach@@ ing four o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k , our cu@@ t-@@ off time — there was about a minute left — and des@@ p@@ air just s@@ et@@ t@@ led over the room ."
"I thought , I &apos;m fai@@ ling as a tea@@ cher ."
I should have g@@ ot@@ ten it so they could have won .
They sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be fai@@ ling like this .
I &apos;ve fai@@ led them .
And I was just feeling so s@@ ad and de@@ j@@ ected .
"And sudd@@ en@@ ly , B@@ ren@@ n@@ an wal@@ ked over to my ch@@ air and he gr@@ ab@@ bed the b@@ ell , the b@@ ell I r@@ ing to sign@@ al a change or a re@@ con@@ ven@@ ing of c@@ ab@@ in@@ ets , and he ran back to his se@@ at , ran@@ g the b@@ ell ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body ran to his ch@@ air : there was scre@@ am@@ ing ; there was y@@ elling , w@@ av@@ ing of their do@@ ssi@@ ers ."
They get these do@@ ssi@@ ers full of secre@@ t doc@@ uments .
They were g@@ esti@@ cul@@ ating ; they were run@@ ning around .
I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my cl@@ ass@@ room .
"P@@ r@@ in@@ cip@@ al wal@@ ks in , I &apos;m out of a job ."
The parents were looking in the win@@ do@@ w .
And B@@ ren@@ n@@ an r@@ uns back to his se@@ at . E@@ ver@@ y@@ body r@@ uns back to their se@@ at .
"He r@@ ings the b@@ ell again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 secon@@ ds left on the c@@ loc@@ k — &quot; &quot; we have , all n@@ ations , po@@ ol@@ ed all our fun@@ ds together ."
And we &apos;ve got 6@@ 00 billion dollars .
We &apos;re going to off@@ er it as a don@@ ation to this poor country .
"And if they accep@@ t it , it &apos;ll rai@@ se their ass@@ et value and we can win the game ."
W@@ ill you accep@@ t it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three secon@@ ds left on the c@@ loc@@ k .
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body looks at this pri@@ me min@@ ister of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And the game is won ."
"S@@ pon@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous compassion that could not be pl@@ ann@@ ed for , that was un@@ exp@@ ected and un@@ predic@@ table ."
E@@ very game we play is different .
"S@@ ome gam@@ es are more about social issu@@ es , some are more about economic issu@@ es ."
S@@ ome gam@@ es are more about war@@ f@@ are .
But I don &apos;t try to den@@ y them that reality of being human .
"I al@@ low them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a bloo@@ d@@ less way , how not to do what they consi@@ der to be the wrong thing ."
"And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves ."
"And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pic@@ k up a cri@@ tical thinking to@@ ol or cre@@ ative thinking to@@ ol from this game and l@@ ever@@ age something good for the world , they may s@@ ave us all ."
If only .
"And on be@@ half of all of my tea@@ chers on wh@@ ose sh@@ oul@@ ders I &apos;m st@@ anding , th@@ ank you . Thank you . Thank you ."
( Applause )
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small to@@ wn ki@@ d .
"I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story ."
He lives in a small village in sou@@ ther@@ n S@@ om@@ ali@@ a .
H@@ is village is n@@ ear Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u .
D@@ rou@@ ght dri@@ ves the small village into po@@ ver@@ ty and to the br@@ ink of star@@ v@@ ation .
"W@@ ith nothing left for him there , he le@@ aves for the big city , in this case , Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , the cap@@ ital of S@@ om@@ ali@@ a ."
"When he arri@@ ves , there are no oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties , no j@@ ob@@ s , no way forward ."
He ends up living in a tent city on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u .
"M@@ ay@@ be a year pas@@ ses , nothing ."
"One day , he &apos;s appro@@ ach@@ ed by a g@@ ent@@ l@@ em@@ an who off@@ ers to take him to l@@ unch , then to din@@ ner , to bre@@ ak@@ fast ."
"He me@@ ets this dy@@ nam@@ ic group of people , and they give him a brea@@ k ."
"He &apos;s given a bit of money to buy h@@ im@@ self some new clo@@ th@@ es , money to s@@ end back home to his family ."
He is intro@@ duc@@ ed to this young woman .
He even@@ tually gets mar@@ ried .
He star@@ ts this new life .
He has a pur@@ pose in life .
"One beautiful day in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , under an az@@ ure bl@@ ue sk@@ y , a car b@@ om@@ b goes off ."
"That small to@@ wn ki@@ d with the big city dre@@ ams was the su@@ ici@@ de b@@ omb@@ er , and that dy@@ nam@@ ic group of people were al S@@ hab@@ a@@ a@@ b , a terror@@ ist organiz@@ ation lin@@ ked to al Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a ."
So how does the story of a small to@@ wn ki@@ d just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blo@@ wing h@@ im@@ self up ?
He was w@@ ai@@ ting .
"He was w@@ ai@@ ting for an opportunity , w@@ ai@@ ting to beg@@ in his future , w@@ ai@@ ting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along ."
This was the first thing that pul@@ led him out of what we call w@@ ai@@ tho@@ od .
And his story re@@ pe@@ ats itself in urb@@ an cent@@ ers around the world .
"It is the story of the dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed , un@@ employ@@ ed urb@@ an y@@ ou@@ th who s@@ par@@ ks ri@@ ots in Joh@@ ann@@ es@@ bur@@ g , s@@ par@@ ks ri@@ ots in L@@ on@@ don , who re@@ ach@@ es out for something other than w@@ ai@@ tho@@ od ."
"For young people , the prom@@ ise of the city , the big city dre@@ am is that of opportunity , of j@@ ob@@ s , of we@@ al@@ th , but young people are not shar@@ ing in the pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity of their cities ."
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s y@@ ou@@ th who suff@@ er from the high@@ est un@@ employ@@ ment r@@ ates .
"B@@ y 20@@ 30 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 ."
"If we do not inclu@@ de young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provi@@ de them oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties , the story of w@@ ai@@ tho@@ od , the g@@ at@@ e@@ way to terror@@ ism , to violence , to g@@ ang@@ s , will be the story of cities 2@@ .@@ 0 ."
"And in my city of bir@@ th , Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , 70 percent of young people suff@@ er from un@@ employ@@ ment ."
"@@ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school ."
They pretty much do nothing .
"I went back to Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u last mon@@ th , and I went to vis@@ it M@@ ad@@ in@@ a H@@ o@@ sp@@ ital , the hosp@@ ital I was born in ."
"I remember st@@ anding in front of that bul@@ let@@ -@@ ri@@ dd@@ en hosp@@ ital thinking , what if I had never left ?"
What if I had been forc@@ ed into that same state of w@@ ai@@ tho@@ od ?
W@@ ould I have become a terror@@ ist ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
My reason for being in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u that mon@@ th was actually to ho@@ st a y@@ ou@@ th lea@@ der@@ ship and entrepren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship sum@@ m@@ it .
I brought together about 90 young S@@ om@@ al@@ i leaders .
We s@@ at down and br@@ ain@@ st@@ orm@@ ed on solutions to the bigg@@ est chall@@ eng@@ es fac@@ ing their city .
One of the young men in the room was A@@ den .
"He went to univers@@ ity in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , grad@@ u@@ ated ."
"There were no j@@ ob@@ s , no oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties ."
"I remember him telling me , because he was a colle@@ ge grad@@ u@@ ate , un@@ employ@@ ed , fr@@ ustr@@ ated , that he was the perf@@ ect tar@@ get for al S@@ hab@@ a@@ a@@ b and other terror@@ ist organiz@@ ations , to be re@@ cru@@ ited ."
They sou@@ ght people like him out .
But his story takes a different rou@@ te .
"In Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , the bigg@@ est b@@ arri@@ er to getting from point A to point B are the ro@@ a@@ ds ."
"T@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ three years of civi@@ l war have completely des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed the ro@@ ad system , and a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke can be the eas@@ i@@ est way to get around ."
A@@ den saw an opportunity and se@@ iz@@ ed it .
He started a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke company .
He began r@@ ent@@ ing out mot@@ or@@ bi@@ kes to local res@@ id@@ ents who couldn &apos;t nor@@ m@@ ally aff@@ or@@ d them .
"He bou@@ ght 10 bi@@ kes , with the help of family and friends , and his dre@@ am is to even@@ tually exp@@ and to s@@ ever@@ al hundre@@ d within the next three years ."
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to identi@@ f@@ y and se@@ ize a new opportunity .
"It &apos;s entrepren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship , and I believe entrepren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship can be the most powerful to@@ ol against w@@ ai@@ tho@@ od ."
It em@@ po@@ w@@ ers young people to be the cre@@ at@@ ors of the very economic oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties they are so des@@ per@@ ately see@@ king .
And you can train young people to be entrepren@@ eurs .
"I want to talk to you about a young man who attend@@ ed one of my me@@ et@@ ings , Mo@@ h@@ am@@ ed Mo@@ h@@ am@@ oud , a fl@@ or@@ ist ."
He was hel@@ ping me train some of the young people at the sum@@ m@@ it in entrepren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship and how to be innov@@ ative and how to create a culture of entrepren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship .
"He &apos;s actually the first fl@@ or@@ ist Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u has seen in over 2@@ 2 years , and until rec@@ ently , until Mo@@ h@@ am@@ ed came along , if you wanted f@@ low@@ ers at your we@@ d@@ ding , you used plas@@ tic bou@@ qu@@ ets shi@@ p@@ ped from ab@@ ro@@ ad ."
"If you asked someone , &quot; Wh@@ en was the last time you saw f@@ res@@ h f@@ low@@ ers ? &quot;"
"@@ for many who gre@@ w up under civi@@ l war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever . &quot; &quot; So Mo@@ h@@ am@@ ed saw an opportunity ."
He started a land@@ s@@ cap@@ ing and design fl@@ or@@ al company .
"He created a far@@ m right outside of Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , and started growing tu@@ li@@ ps and l@@ il@@ ies , which he said could sur@@ vi@@ ve the har@@ s@@ h Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u clim@@ ate ."
"And he began deli@@ ver@@ ing f@@ low@@ ers to we@@ d@@ dings , cre@@ ating gard@@ ens at hom@@ es and bus@@ in@@ esses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on cre@@ ating Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u &apos;s first public par@@ k in 2@@ 2 years ."
There &apos;s no public par@@ k in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u .
"He w@@ ants to create a space where famil@@ ies , young people , can come together , and , as he says , sm@@ ell the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ro@@ ses ."
"And he doesn &apos;t grow ro@@ ses because they use too much water , by the way ."
"So the first step is to insp@@ ire young people , and in that room , Mo@@ h@@ am@@ ed &apos;s pres@@ ence had a really prof@@ ound impact on the y@@ ou@@ th in that room ."
They had never really thought about starting up a business .
"They &apos;ve thought about working for an N@@ G@@ O , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a str@@ ong impact on them ."
He forc@@ ed them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
"He em@@ power@@ ed them to believe that they could be entrepren@@ eurs , that they could be change ma@@ kers ."
"B@@ y the end of the day , they were coming up with innov@@ ative solutions to some of the bigg@@ est chall@@ eng@@ es fac@@ ing their city ."
They came up with entrepren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al solutions to local problems .
"So inspir@@ ing young people and cre@@ ating a culture of entrepren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship is a really great step , but young people need cap@@ ital to make their ideas a reality ."
They need exper@@ ti@@ se and ment@@ or@@ ship to gu@@ ide them in develop@@ ing and l@@ aun@@ ching their bus@@ in@@ esses .
"C@@ onn@@ ect young people with the res@@ ources they need , provi@@ de them the support they need to go from ide@@ ation to cre@@ ation , and you will create cat@@ aly@@ sts for urb@@ an growth ."
"For me , entrepren@@ eu@@ r@@ ship is more than just starting up a business ."
It &apos;s about cre@@ ating a social impact .
Mo@@ h@@ am@@ ed is not simply sel@@ ling f@@ low@@ ers .
I believe he is sel@@ ling hope .
"H@@ is P@@ ea@@ ce Par@@ k , and that &apos;s what he call@@ s it , when it &apos;s created , will actually trans@@ form the way people see their city ."
A@@ den hi@@ red stre@@ et kids to help rent out and ma@@ int@@ ain those bi@@ kes for him .
He gave them the opportunity to es@@ cap@@ e the par@@ aly@@ s@@ is of w@@ ai@@ tho@@ od .
These young entrepren@@ eurs are having a t@@ rem@@ end@@ ous impact in their cities .
"So my sugg@@ es@@ tion is , turn y@@ ou@@ th into entrepren@@ eurs , in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate and n@@ ur@@ ture their in@@ her@@ ent innovation , and you will have more stories of f@@ low@@ ers and P@@ ea@@ ce Par@@ ks than of car b@@ omb@@ s and w@@ ai@@ tho@@ od ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"O@@ kay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play ."
I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
I didn &apos;t realiz@@ e there was going to be a little music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
"( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let &apos;s w@@ el@@ come M@@ r@@ . J@@ am@@ ire W@@ illi@@ ams on the dr@@ um@@ s , ( Applause ) B@@ ur@@ n@@ is@@ s Tr@@ av@@ is on the bas@@ s , ( Applause ) and M@@ r@@ . Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an S@@ ands on the pi@@ an@@ o . ( Applause )"
"So the b@@ and@@ st@@ and , as we call it , this is an incredible space ."
It is really a sac@@ red space .
"And one of the things that is really sac@@ red about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past ."
You really are ali@@ ve right here in this moment .
There are so many dec@@ is@@ ions being made when you walk on the b@@ and@@ st@@ and .
We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
"In the middle , we sort of made our way into a s@@ ong called &quot; &quot; T@@ it@@ i Bo@@ om . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one &apos;s lis@@ ten@@ ing . We &apos;re respon@@ ding .
You have no time for proj@@ ected ideas .
"So the idea of a mis@@ take : F@@ ro@@ m the perspective of a j@@ az@@ z mus@@ ici@@ an , it &apos;s eas@@ ier to talk about someone else &apos;s mis@@ take ."
"So the way I per@@ ce@@ ive a mis@@ take when I &apos;m on the b@@ and@@ st@@ and — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mis@@ take ."
The only mis@@ take lies in that I &apos;m not able to per@@ ce@@ ive what it is that someone else did .
E@@ very &quot; &quot; mis@@ take &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in j@@ az@@ z .
So it &apos;s hard to even descri@@ be what a fun@@ n@@ y n@@ ote would be .
"So for example , if I play@@ ed a colo@@ r , like we were pl@@ aying on a pal@@ ette , that sou@@ n@@ ded like this ..."
( Music ) So if Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an play@@ ed a n@@ ote — like play an F@@ . ( Music )
"S@@ ee , these are all right inside of the colo@@ r pal@@ ette ."
If you play@@ ed an E@@ .
"S@@ ee , these all lie right inside of this gener@@ al emo@@ tional pal@@ ette that we were pain@@ ting ."
"If you play@@ ed an F # though , ( D@@ iss@@ on@@ ance ) to most people &apos;s ear@@ s , they would per@@ ce@@ ive that as a mis@@ take ."
"So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second ."
And we &apos;re going to play on this pal@@ ette .
"And at some point , Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an will intro@@ du@@ ce this n@@ ote ."
And we won &apos;t re@@ act to it .
"He &apos;ll intro@@ du@@ ce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second ."
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this pal@@ ette .
( Music ) So someone could concep@@ tually per@@ ce@@ ive that as a mis@@ take .
The only way that I would say it was a mis@@ take is in that we didn &apos;t re@@ act to it .
It was an opportunity that was m@@ iss@@ ed .
So it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table . We &apos;ll pain@@ t this pal@@ ette again .
"He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll re@@ act to it , but something will change ."
"We &apos;ll all accep@@ t his ideas , or not ."
"( Music ) So you see , he play@@ ed this n@@ ote ."
I ended up cre@@ ating a m@@ el@@ o@@ dy out of it .
The tex@@ ture changed in the dr@@ um@@ s this time .
"It got a little bit more r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ c , a little bit more inten@@ se in respon@@ se to how I respon@@ ded to it ."
So there is no mis@@ take .
"The only mis@@ take is if I &apos;m not aw@@ are , if each individual mus@@ ici@@ an is not aw@@ are and accep@@ ting enough of his fel@@ low b@@ and mem@@ ber to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate the idea and we don &apos;t al@@ low for cre@@ ativ@@ ity ."
"So j@@ az@@ z , this b@@ and@@ st@@ and is absolu@@ tely amazing ."
It &apos;s a very pu@@ ri@@ f@@ ying experience .
And I know that I spea@@ k for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for gran@@ ted .
We know that to be able to come on the b@@ and@@ st@@ and and play music is a bl@@ ess@@ ing .
So how does this all rel@@ ate to behavi@@ or@@ al fin@@ ance ?
"Well we &apos;re j@@ az@@ z mus@@ ici@@ ans , so st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pic@@ ally we don &apos;t have a great relation@@ ship to fin@@ ance ."
"( Laughter ) An@@ y@@ way , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we hand@@ le it ."
And the other dy@@ nam@@ ic of it is that we don &apos;t m@@ ic@@ rom@@ an@@ age in j@@ az@@ z .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually lim@@ its the arti@@ sti@@ c possibil@@ ities .
"If I come up and I dic@@ t@@ ate to the b@@ and that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just j@@ um@@ p right in ..."
"@@ ready , just play some time ."
"One , two , one , two , three , four ."
( Music ) It &apos;s kind of cha@@ o@@ tic because I &apos;m bul@@ l@@ ying my ideas .
"I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to l@@ ist@@ en ."
This is a science of lis@@ ten@@ ing .
It has far more to do with what I can per@@ ce@@ ive than what it is that I can do .
"So if I want the music to get to a certain level of inten@@ s@@ ity , the first step for me is to be patient , to l@@ ist@@ en to what &apos;s going on and pul@@ l from something that &apos;s going on around me ."
"When you do that , you eng@@ age and insp@@ ire the other mus@@ ici@@ ans and they give you more , and grad@@ u@@ ally it buil@@ ds ."
"W@@ at@@ ch . One , two , a one , two , three , four ."
( Music ) T@@ ot@@ ally different experience when I &apos;m pul@@ ling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organ@@ ic . It &apos;s much more nu@@ anc@@ ed .
It &apos;s not about bul@@ l@@ ying my vision or anything like that .
"It &apos;s about being here in the moment , accep@@ ting one another and allo@@ wing cre@@ ativ@@ ity to f@@ low ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real chall@@ eng@@ es is to innov@@ ate fundament@@ ally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ thr@@ all@@ ed to in education ."
This one tea@@ cher didn &apos;t take it ser@@ i@@ ously .
"I want to say that really and tru@@ ly , after these incredible spe@@ e@@ ches and ideas that are being sp@@ read , I am in the aw@@ k@@ ward position of being here to talk to you today about tel@@ ev@@ ision ."
So most everyone wat@@ ches T@@ V .
We like it . We like some parts of it .
"H@@ ere in America , people actually love T@@ V ."
The average American wat@@ ches T@@ V for almost 5 hours a day .
Okay ?
"Now I happen to make my living these days in tel@@ ev@@ ision , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing ."
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
"They , in fact , ber@@ ate it ."
"They call it stu@@ pi@@ d , and wor@@ se , believe me ."
"My mother , growing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; i@@ di@@ ot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to de@@ b@@ ate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good T@@ V or bad T@@ V ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe tel@@ ev@@ ision has a con@@ science ."
"So why I believe that tel@@ ev@@ ision has a con@@ science is that I actually believe that tel@@ ev@@ ision direc@@ tly re@@ fl@@ ects the mor@@ al , political , social and emo@@ tional need st@@ ates of our n@@ ation — that tel@@ ev@@ ision is how we actually dis@@ sem@@ in@@ ate our entire value system ."
"So all these things are uni@@ quel@@ y human , and they all ad@@ d up to our idea of con@@ science ."
"Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad T@@ V ."
We &apos;re talking about popul@@ ar T@@ V .
We &apos;re talking about t@@ op@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated shows over the course of 50 years .
"H@@ ow do these N@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ en r@@ at@@ ings re@@ fl@@ ect not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collec@@ tive un@@ consci@@ ous , but how do these t@@ op@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated shows over 50 years re@@ fl@@ ect the idea of our social con@@ science ?"
"H@@ ow does tel@@ ev@@ ision evol@@ ve over time , and what does this say about our society ?"
"Now spea@@ king of evol@@ ution , from bas@@ ic biolo@@ gy , you probably remember that the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , inclu@@ ding humans , have four bas@@ ic prim@@ al inst@@ inc@@ ts ."
You have hun@@ ger ; you have se@@ x ; you have power ; and you have the ur@@ ge for ac@@ qu@@ is@@ iti@@ ven@@ ess .
"As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evol@@ ved over time to temp@@ er , or ta@@ me , these bas@@ ic animal inst@@ inc@@ ts ."
We have the capac@@ ity to l@@ aug@@ h and cr@@ y .
"We feel a@@ we , we feel p@@ ity ."
That is se@@ par@@ ate and ap@@ art from the animal k@@ ing@@ dom .
The other thing about human be@@ ings is that we love to be ent@@ ert@@ ained .
We love to watch T@@ V .
This is something that c@@ lear@@ ly se@@ par@@ ates us from the animal k@@ ing@@ dom .
"A@@ n@@ im@@ als might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch ."
So I had an ambi@@ tion to disco@@ ver what could be underst@@ ood from this uni@@ quel@@ y human relation@@ ship between tel@@ ev@@ ision program@@ s and the human consci@@ ous .
Why has tel@@ ev@@ ision ent@@ ert@@ ain@@ ment evol@@ ved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this car@@ to@@ on dev@@ il or ang@@ el sitting on our sh@@ oul@@ ders .
"I@@ s tel@@ ev@@ ision literally func@@ tion@@ ing as our con@@ science , temp@@ ting us and re@@ war@@ ding us at the same time ?"
"So to beg@@ in to answer these questions , we did a research study ."
We went back 50 years to the 19@@ 5@@ 9 / 19@@ 60 tel@@ ev@@ ision se@@ as@@ on .
We sur@@ ve@@ y@@ ed the t@@ op@@ -@@ 20 N@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ en shows every year for 50 years — a thou@@ sand shows .
"We tal@@ ked to over 3@@ ,000 individu@@ als — almost 3@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 — ag@@ ed 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emo@@ tion@@ ally ."
How did you feel wat@@ ching every single one of these shows ?
D@@ id you feel a sense of mor@@ al ambi@@ gu@@ ity ?
D@@ id you feel ou@@ tr@@ age ? D@@ id you l@@ aug@@ h ?
What did this mean for you ?
"So to our global TED audi@@ ences , I want to say that this was a U.S. s@@ am@@ ple ."
"But as you can see , these emo@@ tional need st@@ ates are tru@@ ly univers@@ al ."
"And on a f@@ actu@@ al bas@@ is , over 80 percent of the U.S. &apos; s most popul@@ ar shows are ex@@ por@@ ted around the world ."
So I really hope our global audi@@ ences can rel@@ ate .
"T@@ w@@ o ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ments before our first data sli@@ de : F@@ or inspir@@ ing me to even think about the idea of con@@ science and the tr@@ ic@@ ks that con@@ science can play on us on a d@@ ai@@ ly bas@@ is , I th@@ ank leg@@ end@@ ary r@@ ab@@ b@@ i , J@@ ack S@@ tern ."
"And for the way in which I &apos;m going to pres@@ ent the data , I want to th@@ ank TED community super@@ st@@ ar H@@ ans R@@ os@@ ling , who you may have just seen ."
"O@@ kay , here we go ."
"So here you see , from 19@@ 60 to 20@@ 10 , the 50 years of our study ."
"T@@ w@@ o things we &apos;re going to start with — the inspir@@ ation state and the mor@@ al ambi@@ gu@@ ity state , which , for this pur@@ pose , we defin@@ ed inspir@@ ation as tel@@ ev@@ ision shows that u@@ pl@@ i@@ ft me , that make me feel much more positive about the world ."
M@@ or@@ al ambi@@ gu@@ ity are tel@@ ev@@ is@@ ions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
"As we start , you see in 19@@ 60 inspir@@ ation is hol@@ ding st@@ ea@@ dy ."
That &apos;s what we &apos;re wat@@ ching T@@ V for .
M@@ or@@ al ambi@@ gu@@ ity star@@ ts to clim@@ b .
"@@ Right at the end of the 6@@ 0s , mor@@ al ambi@@ gu@@ ity is going up , inspir@@ ation is kind of on the wan@@ e ."
Why ?
"The C@@ u@@ b@@ an M@@ is@@ si@@ le C@@ ris@@ is , J@@ F@@ K is sho@@ t , the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l Ri@@ ghts mo@@ vement , r@@ ace ri@@ ots , the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar , M@@ L@@ K is sho@@ t , B@@ ob@@ by Ken@@ ne@@ dy is sho@@ t , W@@ at@@ er@@ g@@ ate ."
Lo@@ ok what happens .
"In 19@@ 70 , inspir@@ ation pl@@ um@@ me@@ ts ."
M@@ or@@ al ambi@@ gu@@ ity takes off .
"They cro@@ ss , but R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ ag@@ an , a tel@@ e@@ gen@@ ic pres@@ id@@ ent , is in off@@ ice ."
It &apos;s trying to re@@ co@@ ver .
"But look , it can &apos;t : A@@ I@@ D@@ S , I@@ ran@@ -@@ Con@@ tr@@ a , the Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ er dis@@ as@@ ter , Ch@@ er@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l ."
M@@ or@@ al ambi@@ gu@@ ity be@@ comes the dom@@ in@@ ant mem@@ e in tel@@ ev@@ ision from 199@@ 0 for the next 20 years .
T@@ ake a look at this .
This ch@@ art is going to do@@ cu@@ ment a very simil@@ ar tr@@ end .
"But in this case , we have com@@ fort — the bu@@ b@@ ble in red — social comm@@ ent@@ ary and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence in bl@@ ue and green ."
"Now this time on T@@ V you have &quot; &quot; B@@ on@@ anz@@ a , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t for@@ get , you have &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith , &quot; &quot; you have dom@@ es@@ tic shows all about com@@ fort ."
This is ris@@ ing . Com@@ fort st@@ ays whole .
I@@ r@@ re@@ ver@@ ence star@@ ts to r@@ ise .
So@@ cial comm@@ ent@@ ary is all of a sudd@@ en sp@@ i@@ king up .
"You get to 19@@ 6@@ 9 , and look what happens ."
"You have com@@ fort , ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence , and social comm@@ ent@@ ary , not only b@@ att@@ ling it out in our society , but you literally have two est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish@@ ment shows — &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ s@@ mo@@ ke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; G@@ om@@ er P@@ y@@ le &quot; &quot; — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 are the num@@ ber@@ -@@ tw@@ o@@ - and num@@ ber@@ -@@ thre@@ e-@@ r@@ ated tel@@ ev@@ ision shows ."
What &apos;s number one ?
"The soci@@ ally ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent hi@@ p@@ p@@ ie show , &quot; R@@ ow@@ an and M@@ arti@@ n &apos;s L@@ augh@@ -@@ In . &quot;"
"They &apos;re all living together , right ."
V@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ers had respon@@ ded dr@@ am@@ atic@@ ally .
Lo@@ ok at this green sp@@ i@@ ke in 19@@ 6@@ 6 to a b@@ ell@@ we@@ ther show .
"When you guys hear this indus@@ try ter@@ m , a bre@@ ak@@ out h@@ it , what does that mean ?"
"It means in the 19@@ 6@@ 6 tel@@ ev@@ ision se@@ as@@ on , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mo@@ thers B@@ ro@@ thers &quot; &quot; came out of no@@ where ."
"This was the first show that al@@ lowed vie@@ w@@ ers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can comment on how I feel about the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar , about the pres@@ id@@ ency , through tel@@ ev@@ ision ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a bre@@ ak@@ out show ."
"So then , just like the last ch@@ art , look what happens ."
"In 19@@ 70 , the d@@ am bur@@ sts . The d@@ am bur@@ sts ."
Com@@ fort is no longer why we watch tel@@ ev@@ ision .
So@@ cial comm@@ ent@@ ary and ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence r@@ ise thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the 7@@ 0s .
Now look at this .
The 7@@ 0s means who ? Nor@@ man L@@ ear .
"You have &quot; &quot; All in the F@@ am@@ ily , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ an@@ for@@ d and S@@ on , &quot; &quot; and the dom@@ in@@ ant show — in the t@@ op@@ -@@ 10 for the entire 7@@ 0s — &quot; M@@ A@@ S * H@@ . &quot;"
"In the entire 50 years of tel@@ ev@@ ision that we stu@@ died , seven of 10 shows ran@@ ked most high@@ ly for ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ence appe@@ ar@@ ed on air during the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar , five of the t@@ op@@ -@@ 10 during the N@@ i@@ x@@ on ad@@ min@@ istr@@ ation ."
"O@@ n@@ ly one gener@@ ation , 20 years in , and we disco@@ vered , W@@ ow ! T@@ V can do that ?"
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
"So to this very , very sav@@ v@@ y cro@@ w@@ d , I also want to n@@ ote the dig@@ ital fol@@ ks did not in@@ vent dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tive ."
Ar@@ ch@@ ie B@@ un@@ ker was sho@@ ved out of his easy ch@@ air along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
"This is a qu@@ ick ch@@ art . Here &apos;s another at@@ tribu@@ te : fantas@@ y and imagin@@ ation , which are shows defin@@ ed as , &quot; takes me out of my every@@ day re@@ al@@ m &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s m@@ app@@ ed against the red do@@ t , un@@ employ@@ ment , which is a simple Bu@@ re@@ au of L@@ ab@@ or De@@ part@@ ment st@@ ati@@ sti@@ c ."
"You &apos;ll see that every time fantas@@ y and imagin@@ ation shows r@@ ise , it m@@ ap@@ s to a sp@@ i@@ ke in un@@ employ@@ ment ."
D@@ o we want to see shows about people sav@@ ing money and being un@@ employ@@ ed ?
"N@@ o . In the 7@@ 0s you have the b@@ ell@@ we@@ ther show &quot; &quot; The Bi@@ on@@ ic W@@ om@@ an &quot; &quot; that ro@@ ck@@ et@@ ed into the t@@ op@@ -@@ 10 in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , fol@@ lowed by the &quot; &quot; S@@ ix M@@ illi@@ on-@@ D@@ oll@@ ar M@@ an &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ar@@ lie &apos;s An@@ g@@ els . &quot; &quot; A@@ no@@ ther sp@@ i@@ ke in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s — another sp@@ i@@ ke in shows about control and power ."
What were those shows ?
G@@ lam@@ or@@ ous and r@@ ich .
"&quot; D@@ all@@ as , &quot; &quot; F@@ ant@@ as@@ y Is@@ land . &quot;"
In@@ cre@@ di@@ ble m@@ app@@ ing of our national psy@@ che with some hard and fast fac@@ ts : un@@ employ@@ ment .
"So here you are , in my favor@@ ite ch@@ art , because this is our last 20 years ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther or not you &apos;re in my business , you have su@@ re@@ ly heard or read of the dec@@ line of the thing called the thre@@ e-@@ cam@@ era s@@ it@@ co@@ m and the r@@ ise of reality T@@ V ."
"Well , as we say in the business , X mar@@ ks the spo@@ t ."
"The 9@@ 0s — the big bu@@ b@@ bles of hu@@ mo@@ r — we &apos;re wat@@ ching &quot; &quot; F@@ ri@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fr@@ as@@ ier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ e@@ ers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; S@@ e@@ inf@@ el@@ d . &quot; &quot; E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing &apos;s good , low un@@ employ@@ ment ."
But look : X mar@@ ks the spo@@ t .
"In 200@@ 1 , the S@@ ep@@ t@@ ember 200@@ 1 tel@@ ev@@ ision se@@ as@@ on , hu@@ mo@@ r succ@@ um@@ b@@ s to ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment once and for all ."
Why not ?
We had a 2@@ 000 pres@@ identi@@ al el@@ ection decided by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
We had the bur@@ st@@ ing of the t@@ ech bu@@ b@@ ble .
We had 9 / 11 .
An@@ th@@ ra@@ x be@@ comes part of the social l@@ ex@@ ic@@ on .
Lo@@ ok what happens when we keep going .
"A@@ t the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality tel@@ ev@@ ision has taken hold ."
What do people want in their T@@ V then ?
I would have thought reven@@ ge or no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a .
G@@ ive me some com@@ fort ; my world is fall@@ ing ap@@ art .
"N@@ o , they want ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment ."

"So as dr@@ am@@ atic@@ ally different as these tel@@ ev@@ ision shows , pu@@ re ent@@ ert@@ ain@@ ment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one bas@@ ic inst@@ inc@@ t re@@ mains ."
"We &apos;re animals , we need our mom@@ s ."
"There has not been a dec@@ ade of tel@@ ev@@ ision without a defin@@ i@@ tive , dom@@ in@@ ant T@@ V mo@@ m ."
"The 19@@ 5@@ 0s : J@@ une C@@ le@@ ever in the origin@@ al com@@ fort show , &quot; &quot; Le@@ ave it to Be@@ av@@ er . &quot; &quot; L@@ uc@@ ille B@@ all ke@@ pt us l@@ augh@@ ing through the r@@ ise of social consci@@ ous@@ ness in the 6@@ 0s ."
"M@@ au@@ de F@@ ind@@ l@@ ay , the ep@@ it@@ ome of the ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent 19@@ 7@@ 0s , who t@@ ack@@ led abor@@ tion , di@@ v@@ or@@ ce , even men@@ op@@ ause on T@@ V ."
"The 19@@ 8@@ 0s , our first cou@@ g@@ ar was given to us in the form of Al@@ ex@@ is C@@ arr@@ ing@@ ton ."

"Now I don &apos;t know if this is the dev@@ il or the ang@@ el sitting on our con@@ science , sitting on tel@@ ev@@ ision &apos;s sh@@ oul@@ ders , but I do know that I absolu@@ tely love this image ."

But let me also th@@ ank the incredible cre@@ at@@ ors who get up every@@ day to put their ideas on our tel@@ ev@@ ision scre@@ ens thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out all these ages of tel@@ ev@@ ision .
"They give it life on tel@@ ev@@ ision , for sure , but it &apos;s you as vie@@ w@@ ers , through your collec@@ tive social consci@@ ences , that give it life , long@@ ev@@ ity , power or not ."
So th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause )
"Well we all know the World W@@ ide W@@ e@@ b has absolu@@ tely transform@@ ed pu@@ bl@@ ish@@ ing , bro@@ ad@@ cas@@ ting , commer@@ ce and social connec@@ tiv@@ ity , but where did it all come from ?"
"And I &apos;ll quot@@ e three people : V@@ ann@@ ev@@ ar B@@ ush , D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art and T@@ i@@ m B@@ er@@ ner@@ s-@@ Le@@ e ."
So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
This is V@@ ann@@ ev@@ ar B@@ ush .
V@@ ann@@ ev@@ ar B@@ ush was the U.S. government &apos;s chi@@ ef scientifi@@ c ad@@ vis@@ er during the war .
"And in 19@@ 4@@ 5 , he pu@@ bl@@ ished an artic@@ le in a mag@@ az@@ ine called A@@ t@@ l@@ an@@ tic Mon@@ th@@ ly ."
And the artic@@ le was called &quot; &quot; A@@ s We M@@ ay Th@@ ink . &quot; &quot; And what V@@ ann@@ ev@@ ar B@@ ush was saying was the way we use information is bro@@ ken .
We don &apos;t work in terms of li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies and cat@@ alo@@ g systems and so for@@ th .
The brain works by associ@@ ation .
"W@@ ith one it@@ em in its thought , it s@@ n@@ ap@@ s inst@@ antly to the next it@@ em ."
And the way information is struc@@ tu@@ red is tot@@ ally in@@ capable of ke@@ e@@ ping up with this process .
"And so he sugg@@ es@@ ted a machine , and he called it the mem@@ e@@ x ."
"And the mem@@ e@@ x would lin@@ k information , one piece of information to a rel@@ ated piece of information and so for@@ th ."
Now this was in 19@@ 4@@ 5 .
A computer in those days was something the secre@@ t services used to use for code brea@@ king .
And no@@ body knew anything about it .
So this was before the computer was invent@@ ed .
And he pro@@ posed this machine called the mem@@ e@@ x .
"And he had a plat@@ form where you lin@@ ked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will ."
"So sp@@ inning forward , one of the guys who read this artic@@ le was a guy called D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art , and he was a U.S. A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce off@@ ic@@ er ."
And he was read@@ ing it in their li@@ br@@ ary in the F@@ ar E@@ ast .
"And he was so insp@@ i@@ red by this artic@@ le , it kind of direc@@ ted the rest of his life ."
"And by the mi@@ d-@@ 6@@ 0s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the St@@ an@@ for@@ d R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch L@@ a@@ b in Califor@@ ni@@ a ."
He built a system .
"The system was design@@ ed to aug@@ ment human intelligence , it was called ."
"And in a pre@@ mon@@ ition of today &apos;s world of cl@@ oud compu@@ ting and so@@ f@@ tw@@ ar@@ es of service , his system was called N@@ L@@ S for o@@ N@@ -@@ L@@ ine S@@ y@@ st@@ em ."
And this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art .
He was giving a pres@@ ent@@ ation at the F@@ all Jo@@ int Com@@ pu@@ ter Con@@ fer@@ ence in 19@@ 6@@ 8 .
"What he sho@@ wed — he s@@ at on a stage like this , and he dem@@ on@@ str@@ ated this system ."
He had his head mi@@ c like I &apos;ve got .
And he works this system .
"And you can see , he &apos;s working between doc@@ uments and graph@@ ics and so for@@ th ."
"And he &apos;s dri@@ ving it all with this plat@@ form here , with a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ fin@@ ger ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard and the world &apos;s first computer mou@@ se , which he spec@@ i@@ ally design@@ ed in order to do this system ."
So this is where the mou@@ se came from as well .
So this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art .
The trou@@ ble with D@@ ou@@ g En@@ g@@ el@@ b@@ art &apos;s system was that the compu@@ ters in those days cost s@@ ever@@ al million pou@@ nds .
"So for a pers@@ onal computer , a few million pou@@ nds was like having a pers@@ onal j@@ et plan@@ e ; it wasn &apos;t really very pr@@ ac@@ tical ."
"But sp@@ in on to the 8@@ 0s when pers@@ onal compu@@ ters did arrive , then there was room for this kind of system on pers@@ onal compu@@ ters ."
"And my company , O@@ W@@ L built a system called Gu@@ ide for the A@@ p@@ ple M@@ ac@@ in@@ to@@ s@@ h ."
And we deli@@ vered the world &apos;s first hy@@ per@@ t@@ ext system .
And this began to get a head of st@@ ea@@ m .
"A@@ p@@ ple intro@@ duc@@ ed a thing called H@@ y@@ per@@ C@@ ard , and they made a bit of a f@@ us@@ s about it ."
They had a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ page suppl@@ ement in the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ n@@ al the day it l@@ aun@@ ched .
The mag@@ az@@ ines started to co@@ ver it .
B@@ y@@ te mag@@ az@@ ine and Com@@ m@@ un@@ ications at the A@@ C@@ M had spec@@ ial issu@@ es co@@ ver@@ ing hy@@ per@@ t@@ ext .
We developed a P@@ C version of this produc@@ t as well as the M@@ ac@@ in@@ to@@ s@@ h version .
And our P@@ C version became quite mat@@ ure .
These are some exam@@ ples of this system in action in the l@@ ate 8@@ 0s .
"You were able to deli@@ ver doc@@ uments , were able to do it over net@@ works ."
We developed a system such that it had a mark@@ up language based on h@@ t@@ m@@ l .
We called it h@@ m@@ l : hy@@ per@@ t@@ ext mark@@ up language .
"And the system was capable of doing very , very large doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ation systems over computer net@@ works ."
So I took this system to a tra@@ de show in V@@ ers@@ ail@@ les n@@ ear Par@@ is in l@@ ate No@@ v@@ ember 199@@ 0 .
"And I was appro@@ ach@@ ed by a ni@@ ce young man called T@@ i@@ m B@@ er@@ ner@@ s-@@ Le@@ e who said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you I@@ an R@@ it@@ ch@@ ie ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his pro@@ posed system called the World W@@ ide W@@ e@@ b ."
"And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pre@@ tenti@@ ous name , esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally since the whole system ran on his computer in his off@@ ice ."
But he was completely conv@@ inc@@ ed that his World W@@ ide W@@ e@@ b would take over the world one day .
"And he tried to per@@ su@@ ade me to wr@@ ite the bro@@ w@@ ser for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any graph@@ ics or fon@@ ts or l@@ ay@@ out or anything ; it was just pl@@ ain t@@ ext ."
"I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from C@@ E@@ R@@ N , he &apos;s not going to do this ."
So we didn &apos;t do it .
"In the next couple of years , the hy@@ per@@ t@@ ext community didn &apos;t recogni@@ ze him either ."
"In 199@@ 2 , his pap@@ er was re@@ j@@ ected for the H@@ y@@ per@@ t@@ ext Con@@ fer@@ ence ."
"In 199@@ 3 , there was a table at the con@@ fer@@ ence in S@@ e@@ at@@ tle , and a guy called Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ ess@@ en was dem@@ on@@ str@@ ating his little bro@@ w@@ ser for the World W@@ ide W@@ e@@ b ."
"And I saw it , and I thought , y@@ ep , that &apos;s it ."
"And the very next year , in 199@@ 4 , we had the con@@ fer@@ ence here in E@@ din@@ bur@@ g@@ h , and I had no op@@ position in having T@@ i@@ m B@@ er@@ ner@@ s-@@ Le@@ e as the ke@@ y@@ n@@ ote spea@@ ker ."
So that pu@@ ts me in pretty ill@@ us@@ tri@@ ous company .
There was a guy called D@@ ick R@@ o@@ we who was at D@@ ec@@ c@@ a R@@ ec@@ or@@ ds and turned down The Be@@ at@@ les .
"There was a guy called G@@ ary K@@ il@@ d@@ all who went fl@@ ying his plan@@ e when I@@ B@@ M came looking for an oper@@ ating system for the I@@ B@@ M P@@ C , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see B@@ ill G@@ ates ."
"And the 12 pu@@ bl@@ ish@@ ers who turned down J@@ .@@ K@@ . R@@ ow@@ ling &apos;s H@@ arr@@ y P@@ ot@@ ter , I gu@@ ess ."
"On the other hand , there &apos;s Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ ess@@ en who wr@@ ote the world &apos;s first bro@@ w@@ ser for the World W@@ ide W@@ e@@ b ."
"And ac@@ cor@@ ding to F@@ or@@ t@@ une mag@@ az@@ ine , he &apos;s wor@@ th 7@@ 00 million dollars ."
But is he happy ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
"In 199@@ 4 , I wal@@ ked into a pris@@ on in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , and I met a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year-@@ old bo@@ y who had been tor@@ tu@@ red and was den@@ i@@ ed access to coun@@ se@@ l ."
"And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of let@@ ters I had wr@@ it@@ ten for political pris@@ on@@ ers , that I would never have wr@@ it@@ ten a let@@ ter for him , because he was not a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year-@@ old bo@@ y who had done something important for any@@ body ."
He was not a political pris@@ on@@ er .
He was a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year-@@ old bo@@ y who had st@@ ol@@ en a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
"What I also realized at that point was that it was not only C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , but of the 1@@ 1@@ 3 develop@@ ing countries that tor@@ ture , 9@@ 3 of these countries have all pass@@ ed la@@ ws that say you have a right to a la@@ w@@ y@@ er and you have a right not to be tor@@ tu@@ red ."
And what I recogni@@ zed was that there was an incredible win@@ do@@ w of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end tor@@ ture as an investi@@ g@@ ative to@@ ol .
"We often think of tor@@ ture as being political tor@@ ture or res@@ er@@ ved for just the wor@@ st , but , in fact , 9@@ 5 percent of tor@@ ture today is not for political pris@@ on@@ ers ."
"It is for people who are in bro@@ k@@ en-@@ down leg@@ al systems , and un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely because tor@@ ture is the che@@ ap@@ est form of investi@@ g@@ ation — it &apos;s che@@ ap@@ er than having a leg@@ al system , che@@ ap@@ er than having a la@@ w@@ y@@ er and early access to coun@@ se@@ l — it is what happens most of the time ."
"I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a dec@@ ision , to come together and end tor@@ ture as an investi@@ g@@ ative to@@ ol in our li@@ fe@@ time , but it will re@@ qu@@ ire three things ."
"F@@ ir@@ st is the tr@@ aining , em@@ power@@ ment , and conn@@ ection of def@@ end@@ ers wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
The second is in@@ sur@@ ing that there is syst@@ em@@ ati@@ c early access to coun@@ se@@ l .
And the third is comm@@ it@@ ment .
"So in the year 2@@ 000 , I began to won@@ der , what if we came together ?"
C@@ ould we do something for these 9@@ 3 countries ?
And I f@@ oun@@ ded Intern@@ ational B@@ ri@@ d@@ ges to J@@ us@@ tice which has a spec@@ ifi@@ c mission of ending tor@@ ture as an investi@@ g@@ ative to@@ ol and impl@@ ement@@ ing du@@ e process ri@@ ghts in the 9@@ 3 countries by plac@@ ing tr@@ ained la@@ w@@ y@@ ers at an early stage in police st@@ ations and in cour@@ tro@@ oms .
"My first experi@@ ences , though , did come from C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , and at the time I remember first coming to C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia and there were , in 199@@ 4 , still less than 10 att@@ or@@ ne@@ ys in the country because the K@@ h@@ mer R@@ ou@@ ge had kill@@ ed them all ."
"And even 20 years later , there was only 10 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers in the country , so conse@@ qu@@ ently you &apos;d walk into a pris@@ on and not only would you me@@ et 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year-@@ old bo@@ ys , you &apos;d me@@ et women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; W@@ om@@ en would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my h@@ us@@ b@@ and comm@@ it@@ ted a cri@@ me , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no ru@@ le of la@@ w ."
"The first group of def@@ end@@ ers came together and I still remember , as I was tr@@ aining , I said , &quot; Okay , what do you do for an investi@@ g@@ ation ? &quot;"
"And there was sil@@ ence in the clas@@ s , and finally one woman sto@@ od up , &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ re@@ w , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; tea@@ cher . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have def@@ ended more than a hundre@@ d people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any investi@@ g@@ ation , because they all come with conf@@ es@@ sions . &quot; &quot; And we tal@@ ked about , as a clas@@ s , the fact that number one , the conf@@ es@@ sions might not be reli@@ able , but number two , we did not want to encour@@ age the police to keep doing this , esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally as it was now against the la@@ w ."
And it took a lot of cour@@ age for these def@@ end@@ ers to dec@@ ide that they would beg@@ in to st@@ and up and support each other in impl@@ ement@@ ing these la@@ ws .
"And I still remember the first cas@@ es where they came , all 25 together , she would st@@ and up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the ju@@ d@@ ges ke@@ pt saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the ex@@ act same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perf@@ ect case came , and it was a woman who was a ve@@ g@@ et@@ able sel@@ ler , she was sitting outside of a house ."
"She said she actually saw the person run out who she thin@@ ks st@@ ole whatever the j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her ."
She was pre@@ gn@@ ant at the time . She had ci@@ gar@@ ette bur@@ ns on her . She &apos;d mis@@ car@@ ried .
"And when they brought her case to the ju@@ dge , for the first time he sto@@ od up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no ev@@ id@@ ence excep@@ t for your tor@@ ture conf@@ ession and you will be re@@ le@@ as@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And the def@@ end@@ ers began to take cas@@ es over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia ."
But C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia is not alone .
"I used to think , well is it C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia ?"
O@@ r is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
"In B@@ ur@@ un@@ d@@ i I wal@@ ked into a pris@@ on and it wasn &apos;t a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year-@@ old bo@@ y , it was an 8@@ -@@ year-@@ old bo@@ y for ste@@ al@@ ing a mo@@ bile phone ."
"O@@ r a woman , I pic@@ ked up her bab@@ y , really cu@@ te bab@@ y , I said &quot; &quot; Y@@ our bab@@ y is so cu@@ te . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a bab@@ y , she was three ."
"And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was acc@@ used of ste@@ al@@ ing two di@@ ap@@ ers and an ir@@ on for her bab@@ y and still had been in pris@@ on ."
"And when I wal@@ ked up to the pris@@ on direc@@ tor , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out ."
"A ju@@ dge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my pris@@ on . E@@ igh@@ ty percent of the two thou@@ sand people here are without a la@@ w@@ y@@ er . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So la@@ w@@ y@@ ers began to cour@@ age@@ ously st@@ and up together to organiz@@ e a system where they can take cas@@ es ."
"But we realized that it &apos;s not only the tr@@ aining of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , but the conn@@ ection of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers that makes a difference ."
"For example , in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , it was that &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; did not go alone but she had 2@@ 4 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers with her who sto@@ od up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a f@@ res@@ h w@@ ind in the des@@ ert when we can come together . &quot; &quot; O@@ r in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , where I remember In@@ no@@ cent , after coming out of a pris@@ on where everybody sto@@ od up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a tr@@ aining together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people m@@ um@@ bl@@ ing@@ "
"@@ and gr@@ um@@ bl@@ ing — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the res@@ ources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the l@@ ack of res@@ ources is never an ex@@ cu@@ se for in@@ justice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he succ@@ ess@@ fully organiz@@ ed 6@@ 8 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers who have been syst@@ em@@ atic@@ ally taking the cas@@ es ."
"The key that we see , though , is tr@@ aining and then early access ."
"I was rec@@ ently in E@@ gy@@ pt , and was insp@@ i@@ red to me@@ et with another group of la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the stre@@ ets now . The police are one of the main reas@@ ons why we had the re@@ volution . They were tor@@ tur@@ ing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been t@@ ens of millions of dollars that have rec@@ ently gone in to the develop@@ ment of the leg@@ al system here ."
"What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the develop@@ ment ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es , and they were tr@@ aining pro@@ sec@@ u@@ tors and ju@@ d@@ ges , which is the normal bi@@ as , as op@@ posed to def@@ end@@ ers ."
And they sho@@ wed me a man@@ u@@ al which actually was an ex@@ cel@@ lent man@@ u@@ al .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m g@@ onn@@ a cop@@ y this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . L@@ aw@@ y@@ ers can come at the police st@@ ation . It was perf@@ ect ."
Pro@@ sec@@ u@@ tors were perf@@ ect@@ ly tr@@ ained .
"But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the pro@@ sec@@ u@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a p@@ ause , they said , &quot; They had been tor@@ tu@@ red . &quot;"
"So the pi@@ ec@@ es are , not only the tr@@ aining of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , but us fin@@ ding a way to syst@@ em@@ atic@@ ally impl@@ ement early access to coun@@ se@@ l , because they are the sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard in the system for people who are being tor@@ tu@@ red ."
"And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the fact that it sou@@ nds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , o@@ kay , it sou@@ nds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it sou@@ nds big ."
And there are many reas@@ ons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of cre@@ ating mi@@ rac@@ les because of their comm@@ it@@ ment .
"It &apos;s not only In@@ no@@ cent , who I told you about in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , but def@@ end@@ ers all over the world who are looking for these pi@@ ec@@ es ."
"We have a program called J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , and we realized there are people that are cour@@ age@@ ous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?"
So it &apos;s an on@@ line cont@@ est where it &apos;s only five thou@@ sand dollars if you come up with and innov@@ ative way of impl@@ ement@@ ing justice .
"And there are 30 J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the world , from S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ k@@ a to S@@ w@@ az@@ il@@ and to the D@@ R@@ C , who with five thou@@ sand dollars do amazing things , through S@@ M@@ S program@@ s , through par@@ al@@ eg@@ al program@@ s , through whatever they can do ."
"And it &apos;s not only these J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , but people we cour@@ age@@ ously see figure out who their net@@ works are and how they can move it forward ."
"So in China , for inst@@ ance , great la@@ ws came out where it says police cannot tor@@ ture people or they will be p@@ un@@ ished ."
"And I was sitting side by side with one of our very cour@@ age@@ ous la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is impl@@ ement@@ ed ?"
"This is fantas@@ tic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s o@@ kay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on D@@ ec@@ ember 4 , he organiz@@ ed three thou@@ sand mem@@ bers of the Y@@ ou@@ th Com@@ m@@ un@@ ist Le@@ ag@@ ue , from 14 of the top la@@ w scho@@ ols , who organiz@@ ed themselves , developed pos@@ ters with the new la@@ ws , and went to the police st@@ ations and began what he says is a non-@@ viol@@ ent leg@@ al re@@ volution to prot@@ ect ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ri@@ ghts ."
So I tal@@ ked about the fact that we need to train and support def@@ end@@ ers .
We need to syst@@ em@@ atic@@ ally impl@@ ement early access to coun@@ se@@ l .
But the third and most important thing is that we make a comm@@ it@@ ment to this .
"And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s w@@ il@@ d@@ ly ide@@ alis@@ tic ."
"N@@ ever going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end sl@@ av@@ ery , or end ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id ."
It began with a small group of people who decided they would comm@@ it .
"Now , there &apos;s one of our favor@@ ite po@@ ems from the def@@ end@@ ers , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; T@@ ake cour@@ age friends , the ro@@ ad is often long , the pat@@ h is never clear , and the st@@ a@@ kes are very high , but de@@ ep down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only def@@ end@@ ers , but also everyone in the system who is looking to@@ wards it , we can end tor@@ ture as an investi@@ g@@ ative to@@ ol ."
"I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . F@@ ir@@ st of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of V@@ ish@@ n@@ a , who actually was my inspir@@ ation for starting Intern@@ ational B@@ ri@@ d@@ ges to J@@ us@@ tice ."
"@@ V@@ ish@@ n@@ a was a 4@@ -@@ year-@@ old bo@@ y when I met him who was born in a C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ an pris@@ on in K@@ and@@ al Pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce . But because he was born in the pris@@ on , everybody lo@@ ved him , inclu@@ ding the gu@@ ards , so he was the only one who was al@@ lowed to come in and out of the b@@ ars ."
"So , you know , there &apos;s b@@ ars . And by the time that V@@ ish@@ n@@ a was getting bigg@@ er , which means what gets bigg@@ er ? Y@@ our head gets bigg@@ er ."
"So he would come to the first b@@ ar , the second b@@ ar and then the third b@@ ar , and then really s@@ low@@ ly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would gr@@ a@@ b my p@@ in@@ k@@ ie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go vis@@ it ."
"You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to vis@@ it all 1@@ 5@@ 6 pris@@ on@@ ers . And I would li@@ ft him , and he would put his fin@@ g@@ ers through ."
"O@@ r if they were dar@@ k cells , it was like ir@@ on cor@@ ru@@ g@@ ated , and he would put his fin@@ g@@ ers through ."
"And most of the pris@@ on@@ ers said that he was their gre@@ at@@ est jo@@ y and their su@@ n@@ sh@@ ine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s V@@ ish@@ n@@ a . He &apos;s a 4@@ -@@ year-@@ old bo@@ y ."
"He was born in a pris@@ on with almost nothing , no material go@@ o@@ ds , but he had a sense of his own her@@ o@@ ic jour@@ ney , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; Pro@@ bab@@ ly I can &apos;t do everything ."
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
"And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I th@@ ank you for having the pro@@ ph@@ e@@ tic imagin@@ ation to imagine the sh@@ ap@@ ing of a new world with us together , and inv@@ ite you into this jour@@ ney with us ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"And yet you accep@@ t the me@@ eting inv@@ itation , and you go ."
And I &apos;m talking about something far more val@@ u@@ able than off@@ ice fur@@ n@@ iture .
I &apos;m talking about time . Y@@ our time .
"And a w@@ ell@@ -@@ run me@@ eting can y@@ i@@ el@@ d really positive , acti@@ on@@ able resul@@ ts ."
And everybody le@@ aves very an@@ gr@@ y .
It &apos;s kind of fun@@ n@@ y .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) O@@ ur go@@ al today is to come to an ag@@ re@@ ement on a very important pro@@ pos@@ al .
"H@@ i , it &apos;s Jo@@ e . I &apos;m working from home today ."
"( Laughter ) H@@ i , Jo@@ e . Th@@ an@@ ks for jo@@ in@@ ing us today , great ."
O@@ ur go@@ al today is to come to an ag@@ re@@ ement on a very important pro@@ pos@@ al .
"@@ Yeah , it sou@@ nds famil@@ i@@ ar to me , too ."
"A couple of weeks after I put that on@@ line , 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 people in do@@ z@@ ens of countries , I mean do@@ z@@ ens of countries , wat@@ ched this video ."
"And three years later , it &apos;s still getting thousands of vie@@ ws every mon@@ th ."
&quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;
&quot; This is my life . &quot;
"One guy wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s fun@@ n@@ y because it &apos;s true ."
It made me l@@ aug@@ h until I cri@@ ed .
"And cri@@ ed . And I cri@@ ed some more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This poor guy said , &quot; My d@@ ai@@ ly life until re@@ ti@@ rement or death , sig@@ h . &quot;"
A common them@@ e run@@ ning through all of these comm@@ ents on@@ line is this fundament@@ al beli@@ ef that we are power@@ less to do anything other than go to me@@ et@@ ings and suff@@ er through these po@@ or@@ ly run me@@ et@@ ings and live to me@@ et another day .
"But the tru@@ th is , we &apos;re not power@@ less at all ."
"It &apos;s right at our fin@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ ps , literally ."
It &apos;s something that I call ¡ No M@@ A@@ S !
"It &apos;s o@@ kay , you &apos;re al@@ lowed , that &apos;s why it &apos;s there ."
It &apos;s right next to the accep@@ t bu@@ t@@ ton .
"O@@ r the maybe bu@@ t@@ ton , or whatever bu@@ t@@ ton is there for you not to accep@@ t im@@ medi@@ ately ."
And you can make more thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful dec@@ is@@ ions about accep@@ ting it .
P@@ eople might actually start s@@ ending out ag@@ end@@ as . I@@ mag@@ ine !
P@@ eople just might start to change their behavior because you changed y@@ ou@@ rs .
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
And even bl@@ ind bab@@ ies s@@ mi@@ le to the sound of the human vo@@ ice .
Let me show you what I mean .
There are bil@@ lions of inter@@ conn@@ ected neur@@ ons in an impossible t@@ ang@@ le .
But w@@ ait — what is an idea any@@ way ?
S@@ ir K@@ en R@@ ob@@ in@@ son — cre@@ ativ@@ ity is key to our kids &apos; future .
I@@ de@@ as are the most powerful force sh@@ ap@@ ing human culture .
"T@@ w@@ o , give your lis@@ ten@@ ers a reason to care ."
C@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
And I need you to be hon@@ est with the answer .
"C@@ an I ask you to pl@@ ease rec@@ all a time when you really lo@@ ved something — a mo@@ vie , an al@@ bu@@ m , a s@@ ong or a book — and you re@@ comm@@ ended it wh@@ ol@@ e@@ hear@@ te@@ d@@ ly to someone you also really li@@ ked , and you anti@@ cip@@ ated that re@@ action , you w@@ ai@@ ted for it , and it came back , and the person h@@ ated it ?"
"So , by way of intro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school mat@@ h ."
"I s@@ ell a produc@@ t to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forc@@ ed by la@@ w to buy it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a lo@@ sing pro@@ position ."
"So there &apos;s a us@@ e@@ ful st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about students that I see , a us@@ e@@ ful st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about you all ."
"I could give you guys an al@@ ge@@ br@@ a-@@ two final ex@@ am , and I would exp@@ ect no high@@ er than a 25 percent pas@@ s r@@ ate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call mat@@ h education in the U.S. today .
"T@@ o start with , I &apos;d like to brea@@ k mat@@ h down into two cat@@ eg@@ ories ."
One is compu@@ tation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ tor@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ r@@ atic@@ s with lea@@ ding co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ents gre@@ ater than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , provi@@ ded you have a really str@@ ong gr@@ oun@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the appl@@ ication of mat@@ h proc@@ esses to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to ret@@ ain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.@@ S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they won &apos;t ret@@ ain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a mat@@ h tea@@ cher ."
"So first , five sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms that you &apos;re doing mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your cl@@ ass@@ room ."
One is a l@@ ack of initi@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your lec@@ ture bloc@@ k and im@@ medi@@ ately you have five hands going up as@@ king you to re-@@ expl@@ ain the entire thing at their des@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ dents l@@ ack pers@@ ever@@ ance .
"They l@@ ack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find yourself re-@@ expl@@ aining concep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ale ."
"There &apos;s an aver@@ sion to word problems , which descri@@ bes 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the form@@ u@@ la to appl@@ y in that situation .
This is really des@@ truc@@ tive .
"D@@ av@@ id M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ ator of &quot; &quot; D@@ ea@@ d@@ w@@ ood &quot; &quot; and other amazing T@@ V shows , has a really good descri@@ ption for this ."
"He s@@ w@@ o@@ re off cre@@ ating cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary dr@@ ama , shows set in the pres@@ ent day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ resp@@ ect , it sh@@ ap@@ es the neur@@ al p@@ ath@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they exp@@ ect simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an im@@ pati@@ ence with ir@@ res@@ ol@@ ution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re im@@ patient with things that don &apos;t res@@ ol@@ ve quickly ."
"You exp@@ ect s@@ it@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ zed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three commer@@ cial brea@@ ks and a l@@ aug@@ h tr@@ ack ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very concer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and w@@ ell@@ -@@ being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our t@@ ext@@ books — particul@@ arly m@@ ass@@ -@@ adop@@ ted t@@ ext@@ books — te@@ ach mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and patient problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s func@@ tion@@ ally equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and call@@ ing it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a phys@@ ics t@@ ext@@ book .
It appl@@ ies equ@@ ally to mat@@ h .
"N@@ o@@ tice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pi@@ ec@@ es of information there , each of which will figure into a form@@ u@@ la some@@ where , even@@ tually , which the stu@@ dent will then compu@@ te ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the given information in adv@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ plus of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have suff@@ ici@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the t@@ ext@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s h@@ am@@ str@@ ing@@ ing students because , watch this , this is the pr@@ acti@@ ce problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the actu@@ al problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ w@@ app@@ ing out numbers and tw@@ ea@@ king the cont@@ ext a little bit ."
"And if the stu@@ dent still doesn &apos;t recogni@@ ze the st@@ am@@ p this was mo@@ l@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ fully expl@@ ains to you what s@@ am@@ ple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the form@@ u@@ la ."
"You could literally , I mean this , pas@@ s this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any phys@@ ics , just kno@@ wing how to dec@@ ode a t@@ ext@@ book . That &apos;s a sh@@ ame ."
So I can diagno@@ se the problem a little more spec@@ i@@ fic@@ ally in mat@@ h .
Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ pe using a sk@@ i li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate l@@ ay@@ ers , and I &apos;m curi@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate l@@ ay@@ ers and , particul@@ arly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pr@@ essed together and pres@@ ented to the stu@@ dent all at once , how that cre@@ ates this im@@ patient problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll def@@ ine them here : You have the visu@@ al .
"You also have the ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al structure , talking about gri@@ ds , mea@@ su@@ rem@@ ents , lab@@ els , points , ax@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ ste@@ ps , which all l@@ ead to what we really want to talk about : which sec@@ tion is the ste@@ ep@@ est ."
So I hope you can see .
"I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a comp@@ elling question , a comp@@ elling answer , but we &apos;re p@@ av@@ ing a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , str@@ ai@@ ght pat@@ h from one to the other and con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ating our students for how well they can step over the small cr@@ ac@@ ks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the visu@@ al , and I im@@ medi@@ ately ask the question : Wh@@ ich sec@@ tion is the ste@@ ep@@ est ?"
And this star@@ ts conversation because the visu@@ al is created in such a way where you can def@@ end two ans@@ w@@ ers .
"So you get people ar@@ gu@@ ing against each other , friend ver@@ sus friend , in pai@@ rs , journ@@ al@@ ing , whatever ."
And then even@@ tually we realiz@@ e it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the s@@ ki@@ er in the lo@@ wer le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the s@@ ki@@ er just abo@@ ve the mi@@ d line .
"And we realiz@@ e how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D lab@@ els to talk about them more eas@@ ily ."
"And then as we start to def@@ ine what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realiz@@ e it would be ni@@ ce to have some mea@@ su@@ rem@@ ents to really n@@ ar@@ row it down , spec@@ i@@ fic@@ ally what that means ."
"And then and only then , we thro@@ w down that ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al structure ."
"The mat@@ h ser@@ ves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the mat@@ h ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 clas@@ ses are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ pe , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then dev@@ el@@ op those sub@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"D@@ o you guys see how this , right here , compar@@ ed to that — which one cre@@ ates that patient problem sol@@ ving , that mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been obvi@@ ous in my pr@@ acti@@ ce , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ i@@ el@@ d the flo@@ or here for a second to E@@ inst@@ ein , who , I believe , has p@@ aid his du@@ es ."
"He tal@@ ked about the form@@ ul@@ ation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my pr@@ acti@@ ce , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t invol@@ ve them in the form@@ ul@@ ation of the problem ."
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fai@@ r@@ ly comp@@ elling el@@ ements of problems like this from my t@@ ext@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that sup@@ ports mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and patient problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water t@@ ank .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ ir@@ st things first , we el@@ im@@ in@@ ate all the sub@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents have to dev@@ el@@ op those , they have to form@@ ul@@ ate those ."
And then no@@ tice that all the information wr@@ it@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"N@@ one of it &apos;s a dis@@ tr@@ act@@ or , so we lo@@ se that ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents need to dec@@ ide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the colo@@ r of the val@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; S@@ uch an under@@ repres@@ ented question in mat@@ h curr@@ icul@@ um .
So now we have a water t@@ ank .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or cli@@ p art that you so often see in t@@ ext@@ books , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone f@@ ill@@ ing it up ."
"And it &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ing up s@@ low@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ingly s@@ low@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ dents are looking at their wat@@ ches , ro@@ l@@ ling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve b@@ ai@@ ted the ho@@ ok , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really f@@ un for me because , like the in@@ tr@@ o , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not j@@ oin a conversation about mat@@ h because someone else has the form@@ u@@ la ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the form@@ u@@ la better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stu@@ dent is on a level pl@@ aying field of in@@ tu@@ ition ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ one &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ed something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ them@@ atic@@ ally and convers@@ ation@@ ally in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated jo@@ in@@ ing the conversation ."
"We put nam@@ es on the bo@@ ard , att@@ ach them to gu@@ esses , and kids have bou@@ ght in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve descri@@ bed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the tea@@ cher &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion ."
"We , instead , just watch the end of the mo@@ vie ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ ore@@ tical mod@@ els that always work out in the answer key in the back of a tea@@ cher &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s s@@ car@@ y to talk about sour@@ ces of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ ore@@ tical does not mat@@ ch up with the pr@@ ac@@ tical ."
"But those convers@@ ations have been so val@@ u@@ able , am@@ ong the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ port some really f@@ un gam@@ es with students who come pre@@ -@@ inst@@ all@@ ed with these vir@@ uses day one of the clas@@ s .
"These are the kids who now , one sem@@ es@@ ter in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , tot@@ ally new , tot@@ ally fore@@ ign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so f@@ un ."
"We &apos;re no longer aver@@ se to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated by mat@@ h , because we &apos;re s@@ low@@ ly re@@ defin@@ ing what mat@@ h is ."
This has been a lot of f@@ un .
"I encour@@ age mat@@ h tea@@ chers I talk to to use multi@@ media , because it br@@ ings the real world into your cl@@ ass@@ room in high res@@ ol@@ ution and full colo@@ r ; to encour@@ age stu@@ dent in@@ tu@@ ition for that level pl@@ aying field ; to ask the sh@@ or@@ test question you possi@@ bly can and let those more spec@@ ifi@@ c questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because E@@ inst@@ ein said so ; and to finally , in tot@@ al , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the t@@ ext@@ book is hel@@ ping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ lig@@ ation , for patient problem sol@@ ving and mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an amazing time to be a mat@@ h tea@@ cher right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality curr@@ icul@@ um in our front po@@ ck@@ et .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous and fai@@ r@@ ly ch@@ ea@@ p , and the to@@ ols to distribu@@ te it fre@@ ely under open li@@ cen@@ ses has also never been che@@ ap@@ er or more u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous ."
"I put a video ser@@ ies on my blo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vie@@ ws in two weeks ."
"I get em@@ ails still from tea@@ chers in countries I &apos;ve never vis@@ ited saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , y@@ eah . We had a good conversation about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow ."
"I put this problem on my blo@@ g rec@@ ently : In a gro@@ cer@@ y sto@@ re , which line do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 1@@ 9 it@@ ems or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one it@@ ems ."
"And the lin@@ ear mod@@ eling invol@@ ved in that was some good stuff for my cl@@ ass@@ room , but it even@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; G@@ ood M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only conclu@@ de that people , not just students , are really hun@@ gr@@ y for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary for your own in@@ tu@@ ition .
"So I just really encour@@ age you , whatever your st@@ ake is in education — whether you &apos;re a stu@@ dent , par@@ ent , tea@@ cher , poli@@ cy ma@@ ker , whatever — ins@@ ist on better mat@@ h curr@@ icul@@ um ."
We need more patient problem sol@@ vers . Thank you . ( Applause )
"In@@ ter@@ pre@@ ter : P@@ i@@ an@@ o , &quot; &quot; p , &quot; &quot; is my favor@@ ite mus@@ ical sym@@ bo@@ l ."
It means to play so@@ f@@ tly .
"If you &apos;re pl@@ aying a mus@@ ical in@@ stru@@ ment and you no@@ tice a &quot; &quot; p &quot; &quot; in the s@@ core , you need to play so@@ f@@ ter ."
T@@ w@@ o p &apos;s — even so@@ f@@ ter .
F@@ our p &apos;s — ext@@ rem@@ ely so@@ ft .
"This is my dra@@ wing of a p@@ -@@ t@@ ree , which dem@@ on@@ str@@ ates no matter how many thousands u@@ pon thousands of p &apos;s there may be , you &apos;ll never re@@ ach comple@@ te sil@@ ence ."
That &apos;s my cur@@ rent defin@@ ition of sil@@ ence : a very ob@@ s@@ cu@@ re sound .
"I &apos;d like to share a little bit about the history of American S@@ ign L@@ ang@@ u@@ age , A@@ S@@ L , plus a bit of my own back@@ ground ."
So it has a history of about 200 years .
"I was born d@@ ea@@ f , and I was t@@ au@@ ght to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life ."
And I beli@@ ev@@ ed it to be true .
"@@ Y@@ et , I realiz@@ e now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all ."
"S@@ ound was very much a part of my life , really , on my mind every day ."
"As a D@@ ea@@ f person living in a world of sound , it &apos;s as if I was living in a fore@@ ign country , bl@@ ind@@ ly fol@@ lo@@ wing its ru@@ les , cu@@ st@@ oms , behavi@@ ors and nor@@ ms without ever ques@@ tion@@ ing them ."
So how is it that I understand sound ?
"Well , I watch how people be@@ have and res@@ po@@ nd to sound ."
"You people are like my l@@ ou@@ d@@ spea@@ kers , and am@@ pl@@ i@@ f@@ y sound ."
I learn and mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r that behavior .
"A@@ t the same time , I &apos;ve learned that I create sound , and I &apos;ve seen how people res@@ po@@ nd to me ."
"Th@@ us I &apos;ve learned , for example ..."
&quot; D@@ on &apos;t sl@@ am the do@@ or ! &quot;
&quot; D@@ on &apos;t make too much no@@ ise when you &apos;re e@@ ating from the po@@ tat@@ o-@@ chi@@ p b@@ a@@ g ! &quot;
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t bur@@ p , and when you &apos;re e@@ ating , make sure you don &apos;t s@@ cr@@ ape your u@@ ten@@ s@@ ils on the pl@@ ate . &quot; &quot; All of these things I ter@@ m &quot; &quot; sound e@@ ti@@ qu@@ ette . &quot; &quot; M@@ ay@@ be I think about sound e@@ ti@@ qu@@ ette more than the average hear@@ ing person does ."
I &apos;m hy@@ per@@ -@@ vi@@ g@@ il@@ ant around sound .
"And I &apos;m always w@@ ai@@ ting in e@@ ager ner@@ vous anti@@ cip@@ ation around sound , about what &apos;s to come next ."
"H@@ ence , this dra@@ wing ."
"T@@ B@@ D , to be decided ."
"T@@ B@@ C , to be continu@@ ed ."
"T@@ B@@ A , to be ann@@ oun@@ c@@ ed ."
And you no@@ tice the st@@ af@@ f — there are no not@@ es cont@@ ained in the l@@ ines .
That &apos;s because the l@@ ines already cont@@ ain sound through the sub@@ tle s@@ mu@@ d@@ ges and sm@@ ear@@ s .
"In D@@ ea@@ f culture , mo@@ vement is equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent to sound ."
This is a sig@@ n for &quot; &quot; st@@ af@@ f &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
A ty@@ p@@ ical st@@ af@@ f cont@@ ains five l@@ ines .
"@@ Y@@ et for me , sig@@ ning it with my th@@ um@@ b s@@ tic@@ king up like that doesn &apos;t feel natural ."
"That &apos;s why you &apos;ll no@@ tice in my dra@@ w@@ ings , I s@@ tic@@ k to four l@@ ines on pap@@ er ."
"In the year 200@@ 8 , I had the opportunity to trav@@ el to B@@ er@@ l@@ in , G@@ er@@ many , for an arti@@ st res@@ id@@ ency there ."
"P@@ ri@@ or to this time , I had been working as a pain@@ ter ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing this sum@@ mer , I vis@@ ited different mus@@ eu@@ ms and g@@ all@@ ery sp@@ aces , and as I went from one place to the next , I no@@ tic@@ ed there was no visu@@ al art there ."
"A@@ t that time , sound was tr@@ ending , and this struc@@ k me ..."
"@@ there was no visu@@ al art , everything was au@@ d@@ it@@ ory ."
Now sound has come into my art terr@@ it@@ ory .
I@@ s it going to fur@@ ther dist@@ ance me from art ?
I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
I actually know sound .
I know it so well that it doesn &apos;t have to be something just experi@@ enc@@ ed through the ear@@ s .
"It could be felt t@@ actually , or experi@@ enc@@ ed as a visu@@ al , or even as an idea ."
So I decided to re@@ cl@@ ai@@ m ow@@ ner@@ ship of sound and to put it into my art pr@@ acti@@ ce .
"And everything that I had been t@@ au@@ ght regar@@ ding sound , I decided to do away with and un@@ learn ."
I started cre@@ ating a new body of work .
"And when I pres@@ ented this to the art community , I was blo@@ wn away with the amount of support and attention I re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed ."
"I realized : sound is like money , power , control — social curr@@ ency ."
"In the back of my mind , I &apos;ve always felt that sound was your thing , a hear@@ ing person &apos;s thing ."
"And sound is so powerful that it could either dis@@ em@@ power me and my ar@@ t@@ work , or it could em@@ power me ."
I chose to be em@@ power@@ ed .
There &apos;s a mas@@ sive culture around spo@@ ken language .
"And just because I don &apos;t use my liter@@ al vo@@ ice to commun@@ ic@@ ate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a vo@@ ice at all ."
So I need to work with individu@@ als who can support me as an equ@@ al and become my vo@@ ice .
"And that way , I &apos;m able to ma@@ int@@ ain rel@@ ev@@ anc@@ y in society today ."
"So at school , at work and institutions , I work with many different A@@ S@@ L inter@@ pre@@ ters ."
And their vo@@ ice be@@ comes my vo@@ ice and identi@@ ty .
They help me to be heard .
And their vo@@ ices hold value and curr@@ ency .
"I@@ ron@@ ically , by bor@@ ro@@ wing out their vo@@ ices , I &apos;m able to ma@@ int@@ ain a tem@@ por@@ ary form of curr@@ ency , kind of like taking out a lo@@ an with a very high inter@@ est r@@ ate ."
"If I didn &apos;t continue this pr@@ acti@@ ce , I feel that I could just fa@@ de off into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on and not ma@@ int@@ ain any form of social curr@@ ency ."
"So with sound as my new art medi@@ um , I del@@ ved into the world of music ."
And I was sur@@ pris@@ ed to see the simil@@ ari@@ ties between music and A@@ S@@ L .
"For example , a mus@@ ical n@@ ote cannot be fully cap@@ tu@@ red and ex@@ pr@@ essed on pap@@ er ."
And the same hol@@ ds true for a concept in A@@ S@@ L .
They &apos;re both high@@ ly sp@@ ati@@ al and high@@ ly in@@ fl@@ ected — me@@ an@@ ing that sub@@ tle changes can aff@@ ect the entire me@@ an@@ ing of both sig@@ ns and sou@@ nds .
"I &apos;d like to share with you a pi@@ an@@ o met@@ ap@@ h@@ or , to have you have a better understanding of how A@@ S@@ L works ."
"So , en@@ vision a pi@@ an@@ o ."
A@@ S@@ L is bro@@ ken down into many different gr@@ am@@ mati@@ c@@ al par@@ am@@ et@@ ers .
"If you as@@ sig@@ n a different par@@ am@@ eter to each fin@@ ger as you play the pi@@ an@@ o — such as fac@@ ial ex@@ pression , body mo@@ vement , spe@@ ed , hand sh@@ ape and so on , as you play the pi@@ an@@ o — Engl@@ ish is a lin@@ ear language , as if one key is being pr@@ essed at a time ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , A@@ S@@ L is more like a ch@@ or@@ d — all 10 fin@@ g@@ ers need to come down simul@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously to ex@@ pr@@ ess a clear concept or idea in A@@ S@@ L ."
"If just one of those ke@@ ys were to change the ch@@ or@@ d , it would create a completely different me@@ an@@ ing ."
"The same appl@@ ies to music in regar@@ ds to p@@ it@@ ch , t@@ one and volu@@ me ."
"In A@@ S@@ L , by pl@@ aying around with these different gr@@ am@@ mati@@ c@@ al par@@ am@@ et@@ ers , you can ex@@ pr@@ ess different ideas ."
"For example , take the sig@@ n T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T ."
This is the sig@@ n T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T .
I &apos;m looking at you .
St@@ ar@@ ing at you .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Oh — bu@@ st@@ ed . ( Laughter )
U@@ h@@ -@@ oh .
What are you looking at ?
"A@@ w , stop ."
"( Laughter ) I then started thinking , &quot; What if I was to look at A@@ S@@ L through a mus@@ ical l@@ ens ? &quot;"
"If I was to create a sig@@ n and re@@ pe@@ at it over and over , it could become like a piece of visu@@ al music ."
"For example , this is the sig@@ n for &quot; &quot; day , &quot; &quot; as the su@@ n ris@@ es and se@@ ts ."
"This is &quot; &quot; all day . &quot; &quot; If I was to re@@ pe@@ at it and s@@ low it down , visu@@ ally it looks like a piece of music ."
All ... day .
I feel the same hol@@ ds true for &quot; &quot; all night . &quot; &quot; &quot; All night . &quot;
"This is A@@ L@@ L@@ -@@ N@@ I@@ G@@ H@@ T , repres@@ ented in this dra@@ wing ."
"And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of ni@@ ghts : &quot; last night , &quot; &quot; over@@ night , &quot; ( S@@ ings ) &quot; &quot; all night long . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I feel like the third one has a lot more mus@@ ic@@ ality than the other two . ( Laughter )"
This repres@@ ents how time is ex@@ pr@@ essed in A@@ S@@ L and how the dist@@ ance from your body can ex@@ pr@@ ess the changes in time .
"For example , 1@@ H is one hand , 2@@ H is two hand , pres@@ ent ten@@ se happens clo@@ s@@ est and in front of the body , future is in front of the body and the past is to your back ."
"So , the first example is &quot; &quot; a long time ago . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en &quot; &quot; past , &quot; &quot; &quot; used to &quot; and the last one , which is my favor@@ ite , with the very rom@@ an@@ tic and dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c no@@ tion to it , &quot; once u@@ pon a time . &quot;"
( Laughter ) &quot; Com@@ mon time &quot; is a mus@@ ical ter@@ m with a spec@@ ifi@@ c time sig@@ nature of four be@@ ats per mea@@ sure .
"@@ Y@@ et when I see the word &quot; &quot; common time , &quot; &quot; what autom@@ atic@@ ally comes to mind for me is &quot; &quot; at the same time . &quot; &quot; So no@@ tice R@@ H : right hand , L@@ H : left hand ."
We have the st@@ af@@ f across the head and the ch@@ est .
"@@ &#91; H@@ ead : R@@ H , F@@ l@@ ash cl@@ a@@ w &#93; &#91; Com@@ mon time &#93; &#91; Ch@@ est : L@@ H , F@@ l@@ ash cl@@ a@@ w &#93; I &apos;m now going to dem@@ on@@ str@@ ate a hand sh@@ ape called the &quot; &quot; fl@@ ash cl@@ a@@ w . &quot; &quot; C@@ an you pl@@ ease fol@@ low along with me ?"
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body , hands up ."
"Now we &apos;re going to do it in both the head and the ch@@ est , kind of like &quot; &quot; common time &quot; &quot; or at the same time ."
"@@ Yes , got it ."
That means &quot; &quot; to f@@ all in love &quot; &quot; in Intern@@ ational &#91; S@@ ign &#93; .
"( Laughter ) Intern@@ ational &#91; S@@ ign &#93; , as a n@@ ote , is a visu@@ al to@@ ol to help commun@@ ic@@ ate across cul@@ tures and sig@@ n langu@@ ages around the world ."
The second one I &apos;d like to dem@@ on@@ str@@ ate is this — pl@@ ease fol@@ low along with me again .
And now this .
This is &quot; &quot; col@@ on@@ iz@@ ation &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
( Laughter ) Now the third — pl@@ ease fol@@ low along again .
And again .
This is &quot; &quot; en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
So let &apos;s do all three together .
"&quot; F@@ all in love , &quot; &quot; col@@ on@@ iz@@ ation &quot; and &quot; &quot; en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot; &quot; G@@ ood job , everyone ."
"So it &apos;s amazing to see how A@@ S@@ L is ali@@ ve and th@@ ri@@ ving , just like music is ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , in this day and age , we live in a very audi@@ o-@@ cen@@ tri@@ c world ."
"And just because A@@ S@@ L has no sound to it , it autom@@ atic@@ ally hol@@ ds no social curr@@ ency ."
We need to start thinking har@@ der about what defin@@ es social curr@@ ency and al@@ low A@@ S@@ L to dev@@ el@@ op its own form of curr@@ ency — without sound .
And this could possi@@ bly be a step to l@@ ead to a more inclu@@ sive society .
"And maybe people will understand that you don &apos;t need to be d@@ ea@@ f to learn A@@ S@@ L , no@@ r do you have to be hear@@ ing to learn music ."
A@@ S@@ L is such a r@@ ich tre@@ a@@ sure that I &apos;d like you to have the same experience .
"And I &apos;d like to inv@@ ite you to open your ear@@ s , to open your eyes , take part in our culture and experience our visu@@ al language ."
"And you never know , you might just f@@ all in love with us ."
( Applause ) Thank you .
"D@@ en@@ ise K@@ ah@@ l@@ er@@ -@@ B@@ ra@@ at@@ en : H@@ ey , that &apos;s me ."

I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Qu@@ ad@@ r@@ o C@@ or@@ por@@ ation of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of plas@@ tic with a R@@ adi@@ o Sh@@ ack an@@ ten@@ n@@ a atta@@ ched to it .
So that &apos;s just a f@@ un little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ ort of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing comp@@ ati@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a Bu@@ ick hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ al@@ il@@ e@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his tel@@ esc@@ ope to S@@ at@@ ur@@ n ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the side of a gl@@ ass win@@ do@@ w in S@@ a@@ o P@@ au@@ l@@ o .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
"H@@ ere &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the back@@ side , which they started to wi@@ pe off ."
I was born and rais@@ ed in Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a .
"A@@ l@@ though my family const@@ antly stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ed against po@@ ver@@ ty , I was always lo@@ ved and car@@ ed for first , because I was the only son and the youn@@ g@@ est of two in the family ."
But then the great fam@@ ine began in 199@@ 4 .
I was four years old .
My s@@ ister and I would go se@@ arch@@ ing for fi@@ re@@ w@@ ood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after mid@@ night .
"I would w@@ and@@ er the stre@@ ets se@@ arch@@ ing for food , and I remember seeing a small child ti@@ ed to a mother &apos;s back e@@ ating chi@@ ps , and wan@@ ting to ste@@ al them from him ."
H@@ un@@ ger is hum@@ ili@@ ation . H@@ un@@ ger is hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
"For a hun@@ gr@@ y child , poli@@ tics and fre@@ e@@ dom are not even thought of ."
"On my n@@ in@@ th bir@@ th@@ day , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to e@@ at ."
"But even as a child , I could feel the he@@ av@@ iness in their hear@@ ts ."
"O@@ ver a million Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ ans died of star@@ v@@ ation in that time , and in 200@@ 3 , when I was 1@@ 3 years old , my father became one of them ."
I saw my father wi@@ ther away and die .
"In the same year , my mother dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed one day , and then my s@@ ister told me that she was going to China to ear@@ n money , but that she would re@@ turn with money and food so@@ on ."
"S@@ in@@ ce we had never been se@@ par@@ ated , and I thought we would be together fore@@ ver , I didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g when she left ."
It was the bigg@@ est mis@@ take I have ever made in my life .
"But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long go@@ od@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
I have not seen my mo@@ m or my s@@ ister since then .
"S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , I became an or@@ ph@@ an and hom@@ el@@ ess ."
"My d@@ ai@@ ly life became very hard , but very simple ."
My go@@ al was to find a du@@ st@@ y piece of bre@@ ad in the tr@@ ash .
But that is no way to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
"I started to realiz@@ e , be@@ gg@@ ing would not be the solution ."
So I started to ste@@ al from food car@@ ts in il@@ leg@@ al mark@@ ets .
"S@@ ome@@ times , I found small j@@ ob@@ s in ex@@ change for food ."
"O@@ n@@ ce , I even spent two months in the win@@ ter working in a co@@ al mine , 3@@ 3 met@@ ers under@@ ground without any prot@@ ection for up to 16 hours a day ."
I was not un@@ common .
"M@@ any other or@@ ph@@ ans sur@@ viv@@ ed this way , or wor@@ se ."
"When I could not f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep from b@@ it@@ ter c@@ old or hun@@ ger p@@ ains , I hop@@ ed that , the next morning , my s@@ ister would come back to w@@ ake me up with my favor@@ ite food ."
That hope ke@@ pt me ali@@ ve .
"I don &apos;t mean big , grand hope ."
"I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next tr@@ ash can had bre@@ ad , even though it usu@@ ally didn &apos;t ."
"But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die ."
H@@ ope ke@@ pt me ali@@ ve .
"E@@ very day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live ."
"A@@ f@@ ter three years of w@@ ai@@ ting for my s@@ ister &apos;s re@@ turn , I decided to go to China to look for her myself ."
I realized I couldn &apos;t sur@@ vi@@ ve much longer this way .
"I knew the jour@@ ney would be ris@@ ky , but I would be ris@@ king my life either way ."
"I could die of star@@ v@@ ation like my father in Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , or at least I could try for a better life by es@@ cap@@ ing to China ."
I had learned that many people tried to cro@@ ss the bor@@ der to China in the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time to av@@ o@@ id being seen .
Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ an bor@@ der gu@@ ards often sho@@ ot and k@@ ill people trying to cro@@ ss the bor@@ der without per@@ mission .
"Ch@@ in@@ ese sol@@ di@@ ers will cat@@ ch and s@@ end back Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ ans , where they face s@@ ev@@ ere p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment ."
"I decided to cro@@ ss during the day , first because I was still a ki@@ d and s@@ car@@ ed of the dar@@ k , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cro@@ ss during the day , I thought I might be able to cro@@ ss without being seen by any@@ one ."
"I made it to China on F@@ e@@ bru@@ ary 15 , 200@@ 6 ."
I was 16 years old .
"I thought things in China would be eas@@ ier , since there was more food ."
I thought more people would help me .
"But it was har@@ der than living in Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , because I was not free ."
I was always wor@@ ried about being cau@@ ght and sent back .
"B@@ y a mi@@ rac@@ le , some months later , I met someone who was run@@ ning an under@@ ground sh@@ el@@ ter for Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ ans , and was al@@ lowed to live there and e@@ at reg@@ ular me@@ als for the first time in many years ."
"L@@ ater that year , an acti@@ vis@@ t hel@@ ped me es@@ cap@@ e China and go to the United States as a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ."
"I went to America without kno@@ wing a word of Engl@@ ish , yet my social wor@@ ker told me that I had to go to high school ."
"E@@ ven in Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , I was an F stu@@ dent ."
( Laughter ) And I bar@@ ely fin@@ ished el@@ ement@@ ary school .
And I remember I f@@ ought in school more than once a day .
T@@ ext@@ books and the li@@ br@@ ary were not my play@@ ground .
"My father tried very hard to mo@@ tiv@@ ate me into stu@@ d@@ ying , but it didn &apos;t work ."
"A@@ t one point , my father gave up on me ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son any@@ more . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it h@@ ur@@ t me de@@ e@@ pl@@ y ."
"But n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess , my level of mo@@ tiv@@ ation still didn &apos;t change before he died ."
"So in America , it was kind of ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous that they said I should go to high school ."
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
"I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much ."
"But one day , I came home and my fo@@ st@@ er mother had made ch@@ ic@@ ken w@@ ings for din@@ ner ."
"And during din@@ ner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it ."
"When I looked down at my pl@@ ate , I saw the last ch@@ ic@@ ken wing , that my fo@@ st@@ er father had given me his ."
I was so happy .
I looked at him sitting next to me .
"He just looked back at me very w@@ arm@@ ly , but said no words ."
Su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed my biolo@@ gical father .
"My fo@@ st@@ er father &apos;s small act of love re@@ min@@ ded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hun@@ gr@@ y , even if he was star@@ ving ."
"I felt so suff@@ oc@@ ated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of star@@ v@@ ation ."
"My only w@@ ish that night was to co@@ ok a me@@ al for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to hon@@ or him ."
And my answer was to prom@@ ise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to hon@@ or his sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce .
"I took school ser@@ i@@ ously , and for the first time ever in my life , I re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed an ac@@ ad@@ em@@ ic aw@@ ard for ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ence , and made de@@ an &apos;s l@@ ist from the first sem@@ es@@ ter in high school ."
( Applause ) That ch@@ ic@@ ken wing changed my life .
( Laughter ) H@@ ope is pers@@ onal . H@@ ope is something that no one can give to you .
You have to cho@@ ose to believe in hope .
You have to make it yourself .
"In Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , I made it myself ."
H@@ ope brought me to America .
"But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"My fo@@ st@@ er father at that din@@ ner gave me a direction , and he mo@@ tiv@@ ated me and gave me a pur@@ pose to live in America ."
I did not come here by myself .
"I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough ."
M@@ any people hel@@ ped me along the way to get here .
Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ ans are fi@@ gh@@ ting hard to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
"They have to force themselves to sur@@ vi@@ ve , have hope to sur@@ vi@@ ve , but they cannot make it without help ."
This is my message to you .
"H@@ ave hope for yourself , but also help each other ."
"L@@ i@@ fe can be hard for everyone , wh@@ er@@ ever you live ."
My fo@@ st@@ er father didn &apos;t inten@@ d to change my life .
"In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the sm@@ all@@ est act of love ."
"A piece of bre@@ ad can s@@ atis@@ f@@ y your hun@@ ger , and having the hope will bring you bre@@ ad to keep you ali@@ ve ."
But I confi@@ d@@ ently believe that your act of love and car@@ ing can also s@@ ave another Jo@@ se@@ p@@ h &apos;s life and change thousands of other Jo@@ se@@ ph@@ s who are still having hope to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) A@@ dri@@ an H@@ ong : Jo@@ se@@ p@@ h , th@@ ank you for shar@@ ing that very pers@@ onal and spec@@ ial story with us ."
"I know you hav@@ en &apos;t seen your s@@ ister for , you said , it was almost exactly a dec@@ ade , and in the off chance that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to s@@ end her a message ."
Jo@@ se@@ p@@ h K@@ i@@ m : In K@@ ore@@ an ?
"A@@ H : You can do Engl@@ ish , then K@@ ore@@ an as well ."
"( Laughter ) J@@ K : Okay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in K@@ ore@@ an because I don &apos;t think I can make it without t@@ ear@@ ing up ."
"N@@ un@@ a , it has been already 10 years that I hav@@ en ’ t seen you ."
"I just wanted to say that I mis@@ s you , and I love you , and pl@@ ease come back to me and st@@ ay ali@@ ve ."
"And I — oh , go@@ s@@ h ."
I still hav@@ en &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
"I will live my life happ@@ ily and study hard until I see you , and I prom@@ ise I will not cr@@ y again ."
"( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day ."
And can I also make a small message to my mo@@ m ?
"A@@ H : S@@ ure , pl@@ ease ."
"J@@ K : I hav@@ en &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pr@@ ay for me and think about me ."
I just wanted to say th@@ ank you for l@@ etting me be in this world .
Thank you .
( Applause )
How many of you had to f@@ ill out some sort of web form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a dist@@ or@@ ted se@@ qu@@ ence of char@@ ac@@ ters like this ?
"H@@ ow many of you found it really , really an@@ no@@ ying ?"
"O@@ kay , out@@ st@@ anding . So I invent@@ ed that ."
( Laughter ) O@@ r I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
"And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the enti@@ ty f@@ ill@@ ing out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was wr@@ it@@ ten to sub@@ m@@ it the form millions and millions of times ."
"The reason it works is because humans , at least non-@@ visu@@ all@@ y-@@ imp@@ ai@@ red humans , have no trou@@ ble read@@ ing these dist@@ or@@ ted squ@@ ig@@ g@@ ly char@@ ac@@ ters , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as computer program@@ s simply can &apos;t do it as well yet ."
"So for example , in the case of T@@ ick@@ et@@ mas@@ ter , the reason you have to type these dist@@ or@@ ted char@@ ac@@ ters is to pre@@ vent sc@@ al@@ per@@ s from wr@@ iting a program that can buy millions of tic@@ k@@ ets , two at a time ."
C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are used all over the Internet .
"And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the pre@@ c@@ ise se@@ qu@@ ence of ran@@ dom char@@ ac@@ ters that is sh@@ own to the us@@ er is not so for@@ tun@@ ate ."
So this is an example from the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o reg@@ istr@@ ation page .
"The ran@@ dom char@@ ac@@ ters that happened to be sh@@ own to the us@@ er were W , A , I , T , which , of course , sp@@ ell a word ."
But the best part is the message that the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o help des@@ k got about 20 minutes later .
"T@@ ext : &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ p ! I &apos;ve been w@@ ai@@ ting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to w@@ ait ."
"This of course , is not as bad as this poor person ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A Pro@@ j@@ ect is something that we did here at Car@@ ne@@ gie M@@ ell@@ l@@ on over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used every@@ where ."
"L@@ et me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evol@@ ution of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"This is a project that we call re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , which is something that we started here at Car@@ ne@@ gie M@@ ell@@ on , then we turned it into a star@@ tu@@ p company ."
"And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually ac@@ qui@@ red this company ."
So let me tell you what this project started .
So this project started from the fol@@ lo@@ wing realiz@@ ation : It turns out that appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately 200 million C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are ty@@ ped every@@ day by people around the world .
"When I first heard this , I was quite pr@@ oud of myself ."
"I thought , look at the impact that my research has had ."
But then I started feeling bad .
"S@@ ee here &apos;s the thing , each time you type a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , essenti@@ ally you was@@ te 10 secon@@ ds of your time ."
"And if you multi@@ pl@@ y that by 200 million , you get that human@@ ity as a whole is was@@ ting about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 hours every day ty@@ ping these an@@ no@@ ying C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s ."
So then I started feeling bad .
"( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get ri@@ d of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s , because the sec@@ ur@@ ity of the W@@ e@@ b sort of depend@@ s on them ."
"But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this eff@@ ort for something that is good for human@@ ity ?"
"So see , here &apos;s the thing ."
"Wh@@ ile you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , during those 10 secon@@ ds , your brain is doing something amazing ."
Y@@ our brain is doing something that compu@@ ters cannot yet do .
So can we get you to do us@@ e@@ ful work for those 10 secon@@ ds ?
"A@@ no@@ ther way of pu@@ tting it is , is there some hu@@ mon@@ g@@ ous problem that we cannot yet get compu@@ ters to sol@@ ve , yet we can s@@ pl@@ it into tiny 10@@ -@@ second ch@@ un@@ ks such that each time somebody sol@@ ves a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A they sol@@ ve a little bit of this problem ?"
"And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; y@@ es , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now ."
"So what you may not know is that no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays while you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , not only are you auth@@ enti@@ c@@ ating yourself as a human , but in ad@@ di@@ tion you &apos;re actually hel@@ ping us to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books ."
So let me expl@@ ain how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of proj@@ ects out there trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books .
Google has one . The Internet Ar@@ chi@@ ve has one .
"A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , now with the K@@ ind@@ le , is trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books ."
B@@ as@@ ically the way this works is you start with an old book .
"You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Li@@ ke a book ?"
"( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you s@@ can it ."
Now sc@@ ann@@ ing a book is like taking a dig@@ ital photograp@@ h of every page of the book .
It gi@@ ves you an image for every page of the book .
This is an image with t@@ ext for every page of the book .
The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to dec@@ i@@ ph@@ er all of the words in this image .
"That &apos;s using a technology called O@@ C@@ R , for op@@ tical char@@ ac@@ ter recogni@@ tion , which takes a picture of t@@ ext and tries to figure out what t@@ ext is in there ."
Now the problem is that O@@ C@@ R is not perf@@ ect .
"E@@ spec@@ i@@ ally for ol@@ der books where the ink has f@@ ad@@ ed and the p@@ ages have turned y@@ el@@ low , O@@ C@@ R cannot recogni@@ ze a lot of the words ."
"For example , for things that were wr@@ it@@ ten more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recogni@@ ze about 30 percent of the words ."
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recogni@@ ze and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A on the Internet .
"So the next time you type a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , these words that you &apos;re ty@@ ping are actually words that are coming from books that are being di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed that the computer could not recogni@@ ze ."
"And now the reason we have two words no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to pres@@ ent it to you ."
"But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot gr@@ ade it for you ."
"So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer ."
"We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , pl@@ ease type both ."
"And if you type the correc@@ t word for the one for which the system already kno@@ ws the answer , it as@@ su@@ mes you are human , and it also gets some confi@@ d@@ ence that you ty@@ ped the other word correc@@ tly ."
"And if we re@@ pe@@ at this process to like 10 different people and all of them ag@@ ree on what the new word is , then we get one more word di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed acc@@ ur@@ ately ."
So this is how the system works .
"And basically , since we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed it about three or four years ago , a lot of we@@ b@@ s@@ ites have started s@@ wit@@ ching from the old C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people was@@ ted their time to the new C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people are hel@@ ping to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books ."
"So for example , T@@ ick@@ et@@ mas@@ ter ."
"So every time you buy tic@@ k@@ ets on T@@ ick@@ et@@ mas@@ ter , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"F@@ ace@@ book : E@@ very time you ad@@ d a friend or po@@ ke somebody , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"T@@ wit@@ ter and about 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 other s@@ ites are all using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"And in fact , the number of s@@ ites that are using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re di@@ gi@@ ti@@ z@@ ing per day is really , really large ."
"It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent of about two and a half million books a year ."
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people ty@@ ping C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s on the Internet .
"( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , fun@@ n@@ y things can happen ."
And this is esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally true because now we &apos;re giving people two r@@ and@@ om@@ ly cho@@ s@@ en Engl@@ ish words next to each other .
So fun@@ n@@ y things can happen .
"For example , we pres@@ ented this word ."
It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ ans &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
"But if you pres@@ ent it along with another r@@ and@@ om@@ ly cho@@ s@@ en word , bad things can happen ."
"So we get this . ( T@@ ext : bad ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ ans ) But it &apos;s even wor@@ se , because the particular we@@ b@@ site where we sho@@ wed this actually happened to be called The E@@ m@@ b@@ ass@@ y of the K@@ ing@@ dom of God ."
( Laughter ) O@@ op@@ s . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
Joh@@ n@@ E@@ d@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m ( T@@ ext : D@@ am@@ n liber@@ al ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on in@@ sul@@ ting people left and right every@@ day .
"Now , of course , we &apos;re not just in@@ sul@@ ting people ."
"S@@ ee here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re pres@@ ent@@ ing two r@@ and@@ om@@ ly cho@@ s@@ en words , interesting things can happen ."
"So this actually has given r@@ ise to a really big Internet mem@@ e that t@@ ens of thousands of people have particip@@ ated in , which is called C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A art ."
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
"I@@ mag@@ ine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A that you think is some@@ what p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar , like this C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A . ( T@@ ext : in@@ visible to@@ as@@ ter ) Th@@ en what you &apos;re sup@@ posed to do is you take a scre@@ en sho@@ t of it ."
"Th@@ en of course , you f@@ ill out the C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A because you help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book ."
"But then , first you take a scre@@ en sho@@ t , and then you dra@@ w something that is rel@@ ated to it ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
There are t@@ ens of thousands of these .
S@@ ome of them are very cu@@ te . ( T@@ ext : cl@@ en@@ ched it ) ( Laughter ) S@@ ome of them are fun@@ ni@@ er .
"( T@@ ext : st@@ on@@ ed f@@ oun@@ ders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like pal@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ log@@ ical sh@@ vis@@ le , they cont@@ ain S@@ no@@ op D@@ o@@ g@@ g . ( Laughter )"
"O@@ kay , so this is my favor@@ ite number of re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
So this is the favor@@ ite thing that I like about this whole project .
"This is the number of dist@@ inc@@ t people that have hel@@ ped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze at least one word out of a book through re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A : 7@@ 50 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has hel@@ ped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human knowledge ."
And it is numbers like these that mo@@ tiv@@ ate my research ag@@ end@@ a .
"So the question that mo@@ tiv@@ ates my research is the fol@@ lo@@ wing : If you look at human@@ ity &apos;s lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale ach@@ i@@ ev@@ ements , these really big things that human@@ ity has g@@ ot@@ ten together and done hist@@ or@@ ically — like for example , building the p@@ y@@ ram@@ ids of E@@ gy@@ pt or the P@@ an@@ ama C@@ an@@ al or pu@@ tting a man on the Mo@@ on — there is a curi@@ ous fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people ."
"It &apos;s we@@ ird ; they were all done with about 10@@ 0,000 people ."
"And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , co@@ ordin@@ ating more than 10@@ 0,000 people , let alone p@@ aying them , was essenti@@ ally impossible ."
"But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just sh@@ own you a project where we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten 7@@ 50 million people to help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human knowledge ."
"So the question that mo@@ tiv@@ ates my research is , if we can put a man on the Mo@@ on with 10@@ 0,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?"
"So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different proj@@ ects that we &apos;ve been working on ."
Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most exc@@ ited about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been sem@@ i-@@ qui@@ et@@ ly working on for the last year and a half or so .
It h@@ as@@ n &apos;t yet been l@@ aun@@ ched . It &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"S@@ in@@ ce it h@@ as@@ n &apos;t been l@@ aun@@ ched , sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h !"
"( Laughter ) Yeah , I can tr@@ ust you &apos;ll do that ."
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
"It started with me pos@@ ing a question to my grad@@ u@@ ate stu@@ dent , S@@ ever@@ in H@@ ack@@ er ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s S@@ ever@@ in H@@ ack@@ er ."
So I posed the question to my grad@@ u@@ ate stu@@ dent .
"B@@ y the way , you did hear me correc@@ tly ; his last name is H@@ ack@@ er ."
So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free ?
"O@@ kay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b ."
So right now the W@@ e@@ b is parti@@ tion@@ ed into multi@@ ple langu@@ ages .
A large fr@@ action of it is in Engl@@ ish .
"If you don &apos;t know any Engl@@ ish , you can &apos;t access it ."
"But there &apos;s large fr@@ actions in other different langu@@ ages , and if you don &apos;t know those langu@@ ages , you can &apos;t access it ."
"So I would like to trans@@ l@@ ate all of the W@@ e@@ b , or at least most of the W@@ e@@ b , into every maj@@ or language ."
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
"Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use compu@@ ters to trans@@ l@@ ate ?"
Why can &apos;t we use machine trans@@ l@@ ation ?
M@@ ach@@ ine trans@@ l@@ ation no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays is starting to trans@@ l@@ ate some sent@@ ences here and there .
Why can &apos;t we use it to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b ?
Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
It makes a lot of mis@@ takes .
"E@@ ven when it doesn &apos;t make a mis@@ take , since it makes so many mis@@ takes , you don &apos;t know whether to tr@@ ust it or not ."
So let me show you an example of something that was trans@@ l@@ ated with a machine .
A@@ c@@ tually it was a for@@ um pos@@ t .
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt .
It was trans@@ l@@ ated from J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese into Engl@@ ish .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
This person star@@ ts a@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ z@@ ing for the fact that it &apos;s trans@@ l@@ ated with a computer .
So the next sent@@ ence is is going to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to the question .
So he &apos;s just expl@@ aining something .
"R@@ em@@ ember , it &apos;s a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt ."
"( T@@ ext : A@@ t often , the go@@ at@@ -@@ time inst@@ all a er@@ ro@@ r is v@@ om@@ it . ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes the first part of the question ."
"( T@@ ext : How many times like the w@@ ind , a po@@ le , and the dr@@ ag@@ on ? ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes my favor@@ ite part of the question ."
"( T@@ ext : This in@@ sul@@ t to father &apos;s st@@ ones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the ending , which is my favor@@ ite part of the whole thing ."
"( T@@ ext : P@@ lea@@ se a@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze for your stu@@ pi@@ d@@ ity . There are a many th@@ ank you . ) ( Laughter ) Okay , so computer trans@@ l@@ ation , not yet good enough ."
So back to the question .
So we need people to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b .
"So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?"
We could pay professi@@ onal language trans@@ l@@ at@@ ors to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b .
We could do that .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , it would be ext@@ rem@@ ely ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
"For example , trans@@ l@@ ating a tiny , tiny fr@@ action of the whole W@@ e@@ b , W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia , into one other language , S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia ex@@ ists in S@@ pan@@ ish , but it &apos;s very small compar@@ ed to the size of Engl@@ ish ."
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of Engl@@ ish .
"If we wanted to trans@@ l@@ ate the other 80 percent into S@@ pan@@ ish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most explo@@ ited , out@@ sour@@ c@@ ing country out there ."
So it would be very ex@@ pen@@ sive .
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free .
"Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realiz@@ e you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big h@@ ur@@ d@@ les , two big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les ."
The first one is a l@@ ack of bil@@ in@@ gu@@ als .
So I don &apos;t even know if there ex@@ ists 100 million people out there using the W@@ e@@ b who are bil@@ in@@ gu@@ al enough to help us trans@@ l@@ ate .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a l@@ ack of mo@@ tiv@@ ation .
How are we going to mo@@ tiv@@ ate people to actually trans@@ l@@ ate the W@@ e@@ b for free ?
"N@@ orm@@ ally , you have to pay people to do this ."
So how are we going to mo@@ tiv@@ ate them to do it for free ?
"Now when we were starting to think about this , we were bloc@@ ked by these two things ."
"But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to sol@@ ve both these problems with the same solution ."
There &apos;s a way to k@@ ill two bir@@ ds with one st@@ one .
"And that is to trans@@ form language trans@@ l@@ ation into something that millions of people want to do , and that also hel@@ ps with the problem of l@@ ack of bil@@ in@@ gu@@ als , and that is language education ."
"So it turns out that today , there are over 1@@ .@@ 2 billion people learning a fore@@ ign language ."
"P@@ eople really , really want to learn a fore@@ ign language ."
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being forc@@ ed to do so in school .
"For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have p@@ aid over $ 500 for so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to learn a new language ."
"So people really , really want to learn a new language ."
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new we@@ b@@ site — it &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go — where the bas@@ ic idea is people learn a new language for free while simul@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
"So the way this works is wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re a just a beg@@ in@@ ner , we give you very , very simple sent@@ ences ."
"There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sent@@ ences on the W@@ e@@ b ."
"We give you very , very simple sent@@ ences along with what each word means ."
"And as you trans@@ l@@ ate them , and as you see how other people trans@@ l@@ ate them , you start learning the language ."
"And as you get more and more adv@@ anc@@ ed , we give you more and more complex sent@@ ences to trans@@ l@@ ate ."
"But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing ."
Now the cr@@ az@@ y thing about this me@@ th@@ od is that it actually really works .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , people are really , really learning a language ."
"We &apos;re mo@@ st@@ ly done building it , and now we &apos;re tes@@ ting it ."
P@@ eople really can learn a language with it .
And they learn it about as well as the lea@@ ding language learning so@@ f@@ tw@@ are .
So people really do learn a language .
"And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting ."
"Because you see with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , people are actually learning with real cont@@ ent ."
"As op@@ posed to learning with ma@@ de@@ -@@ up sent@@ ences , people are learning with real cont@@ ent , which is in@@ her@@ ently interesting ."
So people really do learn a language .
"But perhaps more sur@@ pris@@ ingly , the trans@@ l@@ ations that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just beg@@ in@@ n@@ ers , the trans@@ l@@ ations that we get are as acc@@ ur@@ ate as those of professi@@ onal language trans@@ l@@ at@@ ors , which is very sur@@ pris@@ ing ."
So let me show you one example .
This is a sent@@ ence that was trans@@ l@@ ated from G@@ er@@ man into Engl@@ ish .
The top is the G@@ er@@ man .
The middle is an Engl@@ ish trans@@ l@@ ation that was done by somebody who was a professi@@ onal Engl@@ ish trans@@ l@@ ator who we p@@ aid 20 c@@ ents a word for this trans@@ l@@ ation .
"And the bot@@ tom is a trans@@ l@@ ation by us@@ ers of D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , n@@ one of wh@@ om knew any G@@ er@@ man before they started using the site ."
"You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perf@@ ect ."
"Now of course , we play a tr@@ ick here to make the trans@@ l@@ ations as good as professi@@ onal language trans@@ l@@ at@@ ors ."
We comb@@ ine the trans@@ l@@ ations of multi@@ ple beg@@ in@@ n@@ ers to get the qu@@ ality of a single professi@@ onal trans@@ l@@ ator .
"Now even though we &apos;re combin@@ ing the trans@@ l@@ ations , the site actually can trans@@ l@@ ate pretty fast ."
"So let me show you , this is our esti@@ mat@@ es of how fast we could trans@@ l@@ ate W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia from Engl@@ ish into S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"R@@ em@@ ember , this is 50 million doll@@ ar@@ s-@@ wor@@ th of value ."
"So if we wanted to trans@@ l@@ ate W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia into S@@ pan@@ ish , we could do it in five weeks with 10@@ 0,000 active us@@ ers ."
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active us@@ ers .
"S@@ in@@ ce all the proj@@ ects that my group has worked on so far have g@@ ot@@ ten millions of us@@ ers , we &apos;re hop@@ e@@ ful that we &apos;ll be able to trans@@ l@@ ate ext@@ rem@@ ely fast with this project ."
Now the thing that I &apos;m most exc@@ ited about with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think this provi@@ des a fai@@ r business model for language education .
"So here &apos;s the thing : The cur@@ rent business model for language education is the stu@@ dent pays , and in particular , the stu@@ dent pays R@@ os@@ et@@ ta St@@ one 500 dollars ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the cur@@ rent business model .
The problem with this business model is that 9@@ 5 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
So it &apos;s ext@@ rem@@ ely un@@ fai@@ r to@@ wards the poor .
This is tot@@ ally bi@@ as@@ ed to@@ wards the r@@ ich .
"Now see , in D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , because while you learn you &apos;re actually cre@@ ating value , you &apos;re trans@@ l@@ ating stuff — which for example , we could char@@ ge somebody for trans@@ l@@ ations ."
So this is how we could mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze this .
"S@@ in@@ ce people are cre@@ ating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time ."
"But the mag@@ ical thing here is that they &apos;re p@@ aying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent any@@ ways learning the language ."
So the ni@@ ce thing about D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think it provi@@ des a fai@@ r business model — one that doesn &apos;t dis@@ crimin@@ ate against poor people .
So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
( Applause ) So here &apos;s the site .
"We hav@@ en &apos;t yet l@@ aun@@ ched , but if you go there , you can sig@@ n up to be part of our priv@@ ate bet@@ a , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks ."
We hav@@ en &apos;t yet l@@ aun@@ ched this D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"B@@ y the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is the work of a really aw@@ es@@ ome team , some of wh@@ om are here ."
So th@@ ank you .
( Applause )
"In O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , there was a fantas@@ tic doc@@ tor , who was very un@@ usu@@ al , nam@@ ed A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ w@@ art ."
"And A@@ li@@ ce was un@@ usu@@ al part@@ ly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty r@@ are in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s ."
"And she was br@@ illi@@ ant , she was one of the , at the time , the youn@@ g@@ est F@@ el@@ low to be el@@ ected to the R@@ oy@@ al C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge of P@@ hy@@ s@@ ici@@ ans ."
"She was un@@ usu@@ al too because she continu@@ ed to work after she got mar@@ ried , after she had kids , and even after she got di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed and was a single par@@ ent , she continu@@ ed her medic@@ al work ."
"And she was un@@ usu@@ al because she was really interested in a new science , the emer@@ g@@ ing field of e@@ pi@@ dem@@ i@@ olo@@ gy , the study of pat@@ tern@@ s in disease ."
"But like every scienti@@ st , she ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated that to make her mar@@ k , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and sol@@ ve it ."
The hard problem that A@@ li@@ ce chose was the ris@@ ing in@@ cid@@ ence of chil@@ d@@ hood c@@ anc@@ ers .
"M@@ o@@ st disease is cor@@ rel@@ ated with po@@ ver@@ ty , but in the case of chil@@ d@@ hood c@@ anc@@ ers , the children who were d@@ ying se@@ em@@ ed mo@@ st@@ ly to come from aff@@ lu@@ ent famil@@ ies ."
"So , what , she wanted to know , could expl@@ ain this an@@ om@@ al@@ y ?"
"Now , A@@ li@@ ce had trou@@ ble getting fun@@ ding for her research ."
"In the end , she got just 1@@ ,000 pou@@ nds from the L@@ ad@@ y T@@ at@@ a M@@ em@@ ori@@ al pr@@ ize ."
And that me@@ ant she knew she only had one sho@@ t at collec@@ ting her data .
"Now , she had no idea what to look for ."
"This really was a ne@@ ed@@ le in a h@@ ay@@ st@@ ack sort of se@@ ar@@ ch , so she asked everything she could think of ."
H@@ ad the children e@@ at@@ en bo@@ il@@ ed s@@ we@@ ets ?
H@@ ad they con@@ sum@@ ed colo@@ red dr@@ in@@ ks ?
D@@ id they e@@ at fish and chi@@ ps ?
D@@ id they have in@@ do@@ or or out@@ do@@ or pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
"And when her car@@ bon cop@@ i@@ ed ques@@ tionn@@ aire started to come back , one thing and one thing only j@@ um@@ ped out with the st@@ atis@@ tical cl@@ ar@@ ity of a kind that most scientists can only dre@@ am of ."
"B@@ y a r@@ ate of two to one , the children who had died had had mo@@ thers who had been X@@ -@@ ray@@ ed when pre@@ gn@@ ant ."
Now that fin@@ ding f@@ le@@ w in the face of conv@@ enti@@ onal w@@ is@@ dom .
"C@@ on@@ v@@ enti@@ onal w@@ is@@ dom hel@@ d that everything was sa@@ fe up to a point , a th@@ res@@ hold ."
"It f@@ le@@ w in the face of conv@@ enti@@ onal w@@ is@@ dom , which was huge en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m for the cool new technology of that age , which was the X@@ -@@ r@@ ay machine ."
"And it f@@ le@@ w in the face of doc@@ tors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who hel@@ ped patients , they didn &apos;t har@@ m them ."
"N@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess , A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ w@@ art r@@ us@@ h@@ ed to pu@@ bl@@ ish her pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary fin@@ dings in The L@@ anc@@ et in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"P@@ eople got very exc@@ ited , there was talk of the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze , and A@@ li@@ ce really was in a big h@@ ur@@ ry to try to study all the cas@@ es of chil@@ d@@ hood cancer she could find before they dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed ."
"In fact , she need not have h@@ ur@@ ried ."
It was fully 25 years before the B@@ ri@@ tis@@ h and medic@@ al — B@@ ri@@ tis@@ h and American medic@@ al est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish@@ ments ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed the pr@@ acti@@ ce of X@@ -@@ r@@ aying pre@@ gn@@ ant women .
"The data was out there , it was open , it was fre@@ ely av@@ ail@@ able , but no@@ body wanted to know ."
"A child a week was d@@ ying , but nothing changed ."
O@@ pen@@ ness alone can &apos;t dri@@ ve change .
So for 25 years A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ w@@ art had a very big fi@@ ght on her hands .
"So , how did she know that she was right ?"
"Well , she had a fantas@@ tic model for thinking ."
"She worked with a st@@ ati@@ sti@@ ci@@ an nam@@ ed Ge@@ or@@ ge K@@ n@@ ea@@ le , and Ge@@ or@@ ge was pretty much everything that A@@ li@@ ce wasn &apos;t ."
"So , A@@ li@@ ce was very out@@ going and soci@@ able , and Ge@@ or@@ ge was a rec@@ lu@@ se ."
"A@@ li@@ ce was very war@@ m , very emp@@ a@@ the@@ tic with her patients ."
Ge@@ or@@ ge fran@@ k@@ ly pre@@ fer@@ red numbers to people .
But he said this fantas@@ tic thing about their working relation@@ ship .
"He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to pro@@ ve D@@ r@@ . S@@ te@@ w@@ art wrong . &quot; &quot; He activ@@ ely sou@@ ght dis@@ con@@ fir@@ mation ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent ways of looking at her mod@@ els , at her st@@ atis@@ tics , different ways of cr@@ un@@ ching the data in order to dis@@ pro@@ ve her ."
He saw his job as cre@@ ating conf@@ lic@@ t around her the@@ ories .
"Because it was only by not being able to pro@@ ve that she was wrong , that Ge@@ or@@ ge could give A@@ li@@ ce the confi@@ d@@ ence she needed to know that she was right ."
It &apos;s a fantas@@ tic model of collabor@@ ation — thinking part@@ n@@ ers who ar@@ en &apos;t e@@ ch@@ o cham@@ bers .
"I won@@ der how many of us have , or d@@ are to have , such collabor@@ at@@ ors ."
A@@ li@@ ce and Ge@@ or@@ ge were very good at conf@@ lic@@ t .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of construc@@ tive conf@@ lic@@ t re@@ qu@@ ire ?
"Well , first of all , it re@@ qui@@ res that we find people who are very different from ourselves ."
"That means we have to res@@ ist the neuro@@ biolo@@ gical dri@@ ve , which means that we really pre@@ f@@ er people mo@@ st@@ ly like ourselves , and it means we have to see@@ k out people with different back@@ gr@@ oun@@ ds , different dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to eng@@ age with them ."
That re@@ qui@@ res a lot of pati@@ ence and a lot of energy .
"And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love ."
Because you simply won &apos;t comm@@ it that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
And it also means that we have to be pre@@ par@@ ed to change our min@@ ds .
"A@@ li@@ ce &apos;s d@@ aughter told me that every time A@@ li@@ ce went hea@@ d-@@ to-@@ head with a fel@@ low scienti@@ st , they made her think and think and think again ."
"&quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y a fi@@ ght , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a on@@ e-@@ to-@@ one relation@@ ship ."
"But it str@@ i@@ kes me that the bigg@@ est problems we face , many of the bigg@@ est dis@@ as@@ ters that we &apos;ve experi@@ enc@@ ed , mo@@ st@@ ly hav@@ en &apos;t come from individu@@ als , they &apos;ve come from organiz@@ ations , some of them bigg@@ er than countries , many of them capable of aff@@ ec@@ ting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives ."
So how do organiz@@ ations think ?
"Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t ."
"And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t ."
And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too af@@ rai@@ d of conf@@ lic@@ t .
"In sur@@ ve@@ ys of Euro@@ pe@@ an and American ex@@ ec@@ uti@@ ves , fully 8@@ 5 percent of them ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ed that they had issu@@ es or concer@@ ns at work that they were af@@ rai@@ d to rai@@ se ."
"A@@ f@@ rai@@ d of the conf@@ lic@@ t that that would pro@@ vo@@ ke , af@@ rai@@ d to get em@@ bro@@ il@@ ed in arg@@ uments that they did not know how to man@@ age , and felt that they were b@@ ound to lo@@ se ."
E@@ igh@@ ty@@ -@@ five percent is a really big number .
It means that organiz@@ ations mo@@ st@@ ly can &apos;t do what Ge@@ or@@ ge and A@@ li@@ ce so tri@@ um@@ ph@@ antly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
"And it means that people like many of us , who have run organiz@@ ations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mo@@ st@@ ly fai@@ l to get the best out of them ."
So how do we dev@@ el@@ op the sk@@ ills that we need ?
"Because it does take sk@@ ill and pr@@ acti@@ ce , too ."
"If we ar@@ en &apos;t going to be af@@ rai@@ d of conf@@ lic@@ t , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it ."
"So , rec@@ ently , I worked with an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive nam@@ ed Jo@@ e , and Jo@@ e worked for a medic@@ al dev@@ ice company ."
And Jo@@ e was very wor@@ ried about the dev@@ ice that he was working on .
He thought that it was too compl@@ ic@@ ated and he thought that its complex@@ ity created mar@@ g@@ ins of er@@ ro@@ r that could really h@@ ur@@ t people .
He was af@@ rai@@ d of doing dam@@ age to the patients he was trying to help .
"But when he looked around his organiz@@ ation , no@@ body else se@@ em@@ ed to be at all wor@@ ried ."
"So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t ."
M@@ ay@@ be he &apos;d look stu@@ pi@@ d .
"But he ke@@ pt wor@@ r@@ ying about it , and he wor@@ ried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he lo@@ ved ."
"In the end , Jo@@ e and I found a way for him to rai@@ se his concer@@ ns ."
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and dou@@ b@@ ts .
So now Jo@@ e had al@@ lies . They could think together .
"And y@@ es , there was a lot of conf@@ lic@@ t and de@@ b@@ ate and ar@@ gu@@ ment , but that al@@ lowed everyone around the table to be cre@@ ative , to sol@@ ve the problem , and to change the dev@@ ice ."
"@@ Jo@@ e was what a lot of people might think of as a wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ blo@@ wer , excep@@ t that like almost all wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ b@@ low@@ ers , he wasn &apos;t a cr@@ ank at all , he was pas@@ si@@ on@@ ately dev@@ ot@@ ed to the organiz@@ ation and the high@@ er pur@@ pos@@ es that that organiz@@ ation serv@@ ed ."
"But he had been so af@@ rai@@ d of conf@@ lic@@ t , until finally he became more af@@ rai@@ d of the sil@@ ence ."
"And when he dar@@ ed to spea@@ k , he disco@@ vered much more inside h@@ im@@ self and much more give in the system than he had ever imagin@@ ed ."
And his colle@@ ag@@ ues don &apos;t think of him as a cr@@ ank .
They think of him as a lea@@ der .
"So , how do we have these convers@@ ations more eas@@ ily and more often ?"
"Well , the Uni@@ versity of D@@ el@@ ft re@@ qui@@ res that its Ph@@ D students have to sub@@ m@@ it five stat@@ ements that they &apos;re pre@@ par@@ ed to def@@ end ."
"It doesn &apos;t really matter what the stat@@ ements are about , what mat@@ ters is that the can@@ di@@ dat@@ es are w@@ ill@@ ing and able to st@@ and up to auth@@ or@@ ity ."
"I think it &apos;s a fantas@@ tic system , but I think le@@ av@@ ing it to Ph@@ D can@@ di@@ dat@@ es is far too few people , and way too l@@ ate in life ."
"I think we need to be tea@@ ching these sk@@ ills to kids and adul@@ ts at every stage of their develop@@ ment , if we want to have thinking organiz@@ ations and a thinking society ."
The fact is that most of the bigg@@ est cat@@ astr@@ oph@@ es that we &apos;ve wit@@ n@@ essed r@@ ar@@ ely come from information that is secre@@ t or hi@@ dd@@ en .
"It comes from information that is fre@@ ely av@@ ail@@ able and out there , but that we are w@@ ill@@ fully bl@@ ind to , because we can &apos;t hand@@ le , don &apos;t want to hand@@ le , the conf@@ lic@@ t that it pro@@ vo@@ kes ."
"But when we d@@ are to brea@@ k that sil@@ ence , or when we d@@ are to see , and we create conf@@ lic@@ t , we en@@ able ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking ."
"O@@ p@@ en information is fantas@@ tic , open net@@ works are essenti@@ al ."
But the tru@@ th won &apos;t set us free until we dev@@ el@@ op the sk@@ ills and the hab@@ it and the tal@@ ent and the mor@@ al cour@@ age to use it .
O@@ pen@@ ness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .

"T@@ w@@ o years ago , I sto@@ od on the TED stage in Ar@@ us@@ h@@ a , T@@ anz@@ an@@ ia ."
I spo@@ ke very bri@@ e@@ fly about one of my pr@@ ou@@ d@@ est cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
"B@@ e@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in M@@ al@@ aw@@ i ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
"On the stage that day , I was so ner@@ vous ."
"My Engl@@ ish lost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by so many az@@ un@@ g@@ u , white people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"A@@ ll s@@ is@@ ters , excep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my d@@ ad when I was a little bo@@ y .
"B@@ e@@ fore I disco@@ vered the won@@ ders of science , I was just a simple far@@ mer in a country of poor f@@ arm@@ ers ."
"L@@ i@@ ke everyone else , we gre@@ w m@@ ai@@ ze ."
One year our for@@ t@@ une turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we experi@@ enc@@ ed an aw@@ ful fam@@ ine .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five months all M@@ al@@ a@@ wi@@ ans began to star@@ ve to death .
"My family ate one me@@ al per day , at night ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ sim@@ a for each one of us .
The food pas@@ ses through our bo@@ dies .
We dro@@ p down to nothing .
"In M@@ al@@ aw@@ i , the secon@@ d@@ ary school , you have to pay school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the hun@@ ger , I was forc@@ ed to dro@@ p out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those dr@@ y fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t accep@@ t .
"I felt very happy to be at the secon@@ d@@ ary school , so I was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to re@@ ce@@ ive education ."
So I went to a li@@ br@@ ary .
"I read books , science books , esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally phys@@ ics ."
I couldn &apos;t read Engl@@ ish that well .
I used di@@ agr@@ ams and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that knowledge in my hands .
It said a w@@ ind@@ mil@@ l could pu@@ m@@ p water and gener@@ ate electr@@ ic@@ ity .
"P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , a def@@ en@@ se against hun@@ ger , which we were experi@@ enc@@ ing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one w@@ ind@@ mil@@ l for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have mater@@ i@@ als to use , so I went to a s@@ cr@@ a@@ p y@@ ard where I found my mater@@ i@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , inclu@@ ding my mother , said I was cr@@ az@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) I found a tr@@ act@@ or f@@ an , sh@@ oc@@ k ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ pes ."
"@@ U@@ sing a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle fr@@ ame and an old b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle dy@@ nam@@ o , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four li@@ ghts , with s@@ wit@@ ches , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it bre@@ ak@@ er , mod@@ el@@ ed after an el@@ ec@@ tri@@ c b@@ ell ."
A@@ no@@ ther machine pu@@ m@@ ps water for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .
Qu@@ eu@@ es of people start lin@@ ing up at my house ( Laughter ) to char@@ ge their mo@@ bile phone .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the re@@ por@@ ters came too , which l@@ ead to blo@@ gg@@ ers and which l@@ ead to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an air@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ le@@ pt in a h@@ ot@@ el .
"So , on stage that day in Ar@@ us@@ h@@ a , my Engl@@ ish lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Afr@@ ic@@ ans , and the poor who are stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with your dre@@ ams ."
God bl@@ ess .
M@@ ay@@ be one day you will watch this on the Internet .
"I say to you , tr@@ ust yourself and believe ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever happens , don &apos;t give up ."
Thank you .

"In the 19@@ 8@@ 0s in the commun@@ ist E@@ as@@ tern G@@ er@@ many , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ wr@@ iter , you had to reg@@ ister it with the government ."
You had to reg@@ ister a s@@ am@@ ple sh@@ e@@ et of t@@ ext out of the ty@@ pe@@ wr@@ iter .
And this was done so the government could tr@@ ack where t@@ ext was coming from .
"If they found a pap@@ er which had the wrong kind of thought , they could tr@@ ack down who created that thought ."
"And we in the W@@ est couldn &apos;t understand how any@@ body could do this , how much this would res@@ tr@@ ic@@ t fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ ech ."
We would never do that in our own countries .
"But today in 20@@ 11 , if you go and buy a colo@@ r l@@ as@@ er prin@@ ter from any maj@@ or l@@ as@@ er prin@@ ter man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ rer and prin@@ t a page , that page will end up having s@@ light y@@ el@@ low d@@ ots prin@@ ted on every single page in a pat@@ tern which makes the page unique to you and to your prin@@ ter ."
This is happening to us today .
And no@@ body seems to be making a f@@ us@@ s about it .
"And this is an example of the ways that our own govern@@ ments are using technology against us , the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ."
And this is one of the main three sour@@ ces of on@@ line problems today .
"If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the on@@ line world , we can group the att@@ ac@@ ks based on the att@@ ack@@ ers ."
We have three main grou@@ ps .
We have on@@ line crimin@@ als .
"L@@ i@@ ke here , we have M@@ r@@ . D@@ im@@ i@@ try G@@ ol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of K@@ i@@ e@@ v in U@@ k@@ r@@ aine ."
And the mo@@ ti@@ ves of on@@ line crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
"They use on@@ line att@@ ac@@ ks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it ."
"We actually have s@@ ever@@ al cas@@ es of milli@@ on@@ aires on@@ line , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ aires , who made money with their att@@ ac@@ ks ."
Here &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir T@@ s@@ as@@ t@@ s@@ in form T@@ ar@@ tu in E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ ez .
This is S@@ te@@ ph@@ en W@@ at@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ d@@ in .
"This is M@@ at@@ the@@ w An@@ der@@ son , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ D@@ a@@ our and so on and so on ."
"These guys make their for@@ tu@@ nes on@@ line , but they make it through the il@@ leg@@ al means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts while we do on@@ line ban@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers to coll@@ ect our cre@@ dit car@@ d information while we are doing on@@ line sh@@ op@@ ping from an inf@@ ected computer ."
"The U.S. S@@ ec@@ re@@ t S@@ er@@ vi@@ ce , two months ago , fro@@ ze the S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t of M@@ r@@ . S@@ am J@@ ain right here , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was fro@@ z@@ en ."
M@@ r@@ . J@@ ain h@@ im@@ self is on the loo@@ se ; no@@ body kno@@ ws where he is .
And I cl@@ ai@@ m it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more lik@@ ely for any of us to become the vic@@ ti@@ m of a cri@@ me on@@ line than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvi@@ ous that this is only going to get wor@@ se .
"In the future , the major@@ ity of cri@@ me will be happening on@@ line ."
The second maj@@ or group of att@@ ack@@ ers that we are wat@@ ching today are not mo@@ tiv@@ ated by money .
"They &apos;re mo@@ tiv@@ ated by something else — mo@@ tiv@@ ated by prot@@ es@@ ts , mo@@ tiv@@ ated by an op@@ in@@ ion , mo@@ tiv@@ ated by the l@@ augh@@ s ."
G@@ rou@@ ps like An@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a maj@@ or play@@ er in the field of on@@ line att@@ ac@@ ks .
"So those are the three main att@@ ack@@ ers : crimin@@ als who do it for the money , h@@ ack@@ ti@@ vis@@ ts like An@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous doing it for the prot@@ est , but then the last group are n@@ ation st@@ ates , govern@@ ments doing the att@@ ac@@ ks ."
And then we look at cas@@ es like what happened in D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a pri@@ me example of what happens when govern@@ ments att@@ ack against their own ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens .
"D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate Au@@ th@@ or@@ ity from The Ne@@ ther@@ l@@ ands — or actually , it was ."
It was run@@ ning into ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ cy last f@@ all because they were h@@ ac@@ ked into .
S@@ ome@@ body bro@@ ke in and they h@@ ac@@ ked it th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly .
"And I asked last week in a me@@ eting with D@@ u@@ t@@ ch government repres@@ ent@@ atives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pl@@ au@@ sible that people died because of the D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar h@@ ack ."
And his answer was y@@ es .
So how do people die as the resul@@ t of a h@@ ack like this ?
Well D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .@@ A@@ .
They s@@ ell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
"Well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a we@@ b@@ site that has h@@ t@@ t@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ted services , services like G@@ m@@ ail ."
"Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ m@@ ail or one of their com@@ peti@@ tors , but these services are esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally popul@@ ar in tot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an st@@ ates like I@@ ran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use fore@@ ign services like G@@ m@@ ail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L connec@@ tions , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their discus@@ sions ."
Ex@@ cep@@ t they can if they h@@ ack into a fore@@ ign C@@ .@@ A@@ .
and issue ro@@ gue cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
"What about A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in E@@ gy@@ pt ?"
"Well in E@@ gy@@ pt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the hea@@ d@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of the E@@ gy@@ p@@ ti@@ an secre@@ t police in A@@ pr@@ il 20@@ 11 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of pap@@ ers ."
"A@@ mon@@ g those pap@@ ers , was this b@@ in@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And within that b@@ in@@ der were not@@ es from a company based in G@@ er@@ many which had sol@@ d the E@@ gy@@ p@@ ti@@ an government a set of to@@ ols for inter@@ cep@@ ting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens of the country ."
"They had sol@@ d this to@@ ol for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 Euro@@ s to the E@@ gy@@ p@@ ti@@ an government ."
The company hea@@ d@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters are right here .
So W@@ es@@ tern govern@@ ments are provi@@ ding tot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an govern@@ ments with to@@ ols to do this against their own ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens .
But W@@ es@@ tern govern@@ ments are doing it to themselves as well .
"For example , in G@@ er@@ many , just a couple of weeks ago the so@@ -@@ called St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by G@@ er@@ man government off@@ ici@@ als to investi@@ g@@ ate their own ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ."
"If you are a su@@ sp@@ ect in a crimin@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous , your phone will be t@@ app@@ ed ."
"But today , it goes be@@ y@@ ond that ."
They will ta@@ p your Internet conn@@ ection .
"They will even use to@@ ols like St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an to inf@@ ect your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ables them to watch all your communication , to l@@ ist@@ en to your on@@ line discus@@ sions , to coll@@ ect your pass@@ words ."
"Now when we think de@@ e@@ per about things like these , the obvi@@ ous respon@@ se from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sou@@ nds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really aff@@ ect me because I &apos;m a leg@@ al ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ."
Why should I wor@@ ry ?
"Because I have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot; &quot; And this is an ar@@ gu@@ ment , which doesn &apos;t make sense ."
P@@ ri@@ v@@ acy is impl@@ i@@ ed .
P@@ ri@@ v@@ acy is not up for discus@@ sion .
This is not a question between priv@@ acy against sec@@ ur@@ ity .
It &apos;s a question of fre@@ e@@ dom against control .
"And while we might tr@@ ust our govern@@ ments right now , right here in 20@@ 11 , any right we give away will be given away for good ."
"And do we tr@@ ust , do we bl@@ ind@@ ly tr@@ ust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?"
And these are the questions that we have to wor@@ ry about for the next 50 years .
We ret@@ ain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying m@@ un@@ d@@ ane sou@@ nds .
"This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble dr@@ y@@ er ."
"Now sound is my pas@@ sion , it &apos;s my life ."
( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to spea@@ k today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ ues .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally underst@@ ood that questions of mor@@ ality — questions of good and ev@@ il and right and wrong — are questions about which science off@@ ici@@ ally has no op@@ in@@ ion ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value ."
"And , conse@@ qu@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ stitu@@ tes a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to ar@@ gue that this is an il@@ lu@@ sion — that the se@@ par@@ ation between science and human val@@ ues is an il@@ lu@@ sion — and actually quite a danger@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ ues se@@ em to bel@@ ong to different sp@@ her@@ es ."
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ ption of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ ues are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of consci@@ ous cre@@ atures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ th@@ ical ob@@ lig@@ ations to@@ ward ro@@ c@@ ks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for ro@@ c@@ ks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ c@@ ks can suff@@ er . And if we &apos;re more concer@@ ned about our fel@@ low prim@@ ates than we are about insec@@ ts , as in@@ de@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ posed to a gre@@ ater r@@ ange of potenti@@ al happ@@ iness and suff@@ ering ."
"Now , the cru@@ cial thing to no@@ tice here is that this is a f@@ actu@@ al cl@@ ai@@ m : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ constru@@ ed the relation@@ ship between biolo@@ gical complex@@ ity and the possibil@@ ities of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of insec@@ ts ."
"And there &apos;s no no@@ tion , no version of human mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble to a concer@@ n about consci@@ ous experience and its possible changes ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ ues from religion , even if you think that good and ev@@ il ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely rel@@ ate to conditions after death — either to an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of happ@@ iness with God or an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of suff@@ ering in h@@ ell — you are still concer@@ ned about consci@@ ous@@ ness and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can pers@@ ist after death is itself a f@@ actu@@ al cl@@ ai@@ m , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to spea@@ k about the conditions of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a continu@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fai@@ led state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mo@@ thers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where str@@ ang@@ ers cannot find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ace@@ ful collabor@@ ation , where people are m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in@@ dis@@ crimin@@ ately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continu@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more id@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a con@@ fer@@ ence like this is even con@@ ce@@ iv@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ era to the water be a good idea ?
Pro@@ bab@@ ly not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the ev@@ il ey@@ e , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ ately bl@@ ame their neigh@@ b@@ ors ? Pro@@ bab@@ ly not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human communi@@ ties fl@@ our@@ ish , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And mor@@ ality rel@@ ates to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ ues we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our situation in the world can be underst@@ ood at many lev@@ els — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic systems and political arr@@ ang@@ ements ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being we are , of nec@@ ess@@ ity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ ici@@ de b@@ omb@@ er does get 7@@ 2 vir@@ g@@ ins in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his pers@@ on@@ ality — his rather un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate pers@@ on@@ ality — is the produc@@ t of his brain ."
"So the contribu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as in@@ de@@ ed it does , it changes us by changing our br@@ ains ."
"And so ther@@ e@@ fore whatever cul@@ tural vari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ our@@ ish can , at least in prin@@ ci@@ ple , be underst@@ ood in the cont@@ ext of a mat@@ ur@@ ing science of the mind — neuro@@ science , psycho@@ lo@@ gy , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m ar@@ gu@@ ing is that value &apos;s re@@ duc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the consci@@ ous experience of consci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can ther@@ e@@ fore visu@@ aliz@@ e a space of possible changes in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a mor@@ al land@@ s@@ cap@@ e , with p@@ ea@@ ks and val@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ res@@ po@@ nd to differ@@ ences in the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of consci@@ ous cre@@ atures , both pers@@ onal and collec@@ tive ."
"And one thing to no@@ tice is that perhaps there are st@@ ates of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being that we r@@ ar@@ ely access , that few people access ."
And these aw@@ ait our disco@@ very .
P@@ er@@ haps some of these st@@ ates can be appro@@ pri@@ ately called my@@ s@@ tical or spir@@ itu@@ al .
P@@ er@@ haps there are other st@@ ates that we can &apos;t access because of how our min@@ ds are struc@@ tu@@ red but other min@@ ds possi@@ bly could access them .
"Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to ma@@ p this space , or that we will have scientifi@@ c ans@@ w@@ ers to every con@@ ce@@ iv@@ able mor@@ al question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for inst@@ ance , that you will one day con@@ sul@@ t a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should b@@ om@@ b I@@ ran &apos;s nuc@@ l@@ ear fac@@ ili@@ ties , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the full cost of TED as a business ex@@ pense ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions aff@@ ect human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being then they do have ans@@ w@@ ers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ m@@ itting this — just ad@@ m@@ itting that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to the question of how humans fl@@ our@@ ish — will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our exp@@ ect@@ ations of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For inst@@ ance , there are 2@@ 1 st@@ ates in our country where cor@@ por@@ al p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment in the cl@@ ass@@ room is leg@@ al , where it is leg@@ al for a tea@@ cher to be@@ at a child with a w@@ oo@@ den bo@@ ard , hard , and rais@@ ing large bru@@ is@@ es and bl@@ is@@ ters and even brea@@ king the sk@@ in ."
"And hundreds of thousands of children , in@@ cid@@ ent@@ ally , are subj@@ ected to this every year ."
"The loc@@ ations of these en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed dis@@ tr@@ ic@@ ts , I think , will fai@@ l to sur@@ prise you ."
We &apos;re not talking about C@@ onn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut .
And the r@@ ation@@ ale for this behavior is expl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly religi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ ator of the universe h@@ im@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , l@@ est we spo@@ il the child — this is in Pro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the obvi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally spea@@ king , to subj@@ ect children to pain and violence and public hum@@ ili@@ ation as a way of encour@@ ag@@ ing heal@@ thy emo@@ tional develop@@ ment and good behavior ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any dou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the no@@ tion of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being is tru@@ ly un@@ defin@@ ed , and se@@ em@@ ingly per@@ pe@@ tually open to be re-@@ constru@@ ed ."
"And so , how ther@@ e@@ fore can there be an objec@@ tive no@@ tion of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ?"
"Well , consi@@ der by an@@ alo@@ gy , the concept of physical health ."
The concept of physical health is un@@ defin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from Mi@@ cha@@ el S@@ p@@ ec@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
Wh@@ en this stat@@ ue was car@@ ved the average life exp@@ ect@@ anc@@ y was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ dd@@ le with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to run a mar@@ ath@@ on at age 200 will be consi@@ der@@ ed a prof@@ ound dis@@ ability .
P@@ eople will s@@ end you don@@ ations when you &apos;re in that condi@@ tion .
"( Laughter ) No@@ tice that the fact that the concept of health is open , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely open for re@@ vision , does not make it v@@ ac@@ u@@ ous ."
The dist@@ inc@@ tion between a heal@@ thy person and a d@@ ead one is about as clear and conse@@ qu@@ enti@@ al as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to no@@ tice is there may be many p@@ ea@@ ks on the mor@@ al land@@ s@@ cap@@ e : There may be equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent ways to organiz@@ e a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize human fl@@ our@@ ish@@ ing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ mine an objec@@ tive mor@@ ality ?"
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be temp@@ ted to ar@@ gue to you that there must be one right food to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a r@@ ange of mater@@ i@@ als that con@@ stitu@@ te heal@@ thy food .
But there &apos;s n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess a clear dist@@ inc@@ tion between food and po@@ is@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ w@@ ers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not temp@@ t us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human nu@@ tri@@ tion ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a univers@@ al mor@@ ality would re@@ qu@@ ire mor@@ al pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ m@@ it of no excep@@ tions .
"So , for inst@@ ance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an excep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as mor@@ al tru@@ th ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , by an@@ alo@@ gy , the game of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to play good ch@@ ess , a prin@@ ci@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t lo@@ se your Qu@@ e@@ en , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its some excep@@ tions .
There are moments when lo@@ sing your Qu@@ e@@ en is a br@@ illi@@ ant thing to do .
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a dom@@ ain of perf@@ ect objec@@ tiv@@ ity ."
The fact that there are excep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this br@@ ings us to the sor@@ ts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the mor@@ al sp@@ here ."
Con@@ si@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ dies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can co@@ ver them up .
"Now , it is the position , gener@@ ally spea@@ king , of our int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ al community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Bo@@ st@@ on or P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , who are we to say that the pr@@ oud den@@ iz@@ ens of an anci@@ ent culture are wrong to force their wi@@ ves and d@@ augh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with l@@ eng@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or thro@@ w bat@@ ter@@ y ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they dec@@ line the priv@@ il@@ e@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pre@@ ten@@ d that we know so little about human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being that we have to be non-@@ ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental about a pr@@ acti@@ ce like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary w@@ ear@@ ing of a ve@@ il — women should be able to w@@ ear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concer@@ ned ."
"But what does vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary mean in a community where , when a girl gets rap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first im@@ pul@@ se , rather often , is to m@@ ur@@ der her out of sh@@ ame ?"
"J@@ ust let that fact det@@ on@@ ate in your brain for a minute : Y@@ our d@@ aughter gets rap@@ ed , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the ch@@ ances that repres@@ ents a p@@ ea@@ k of human fl@@ our@@ ish@@ ing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perf@@ ect solution in our own society ."
"For inst@@ ance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ st@@ and almost any@@ where in the civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ed world ."
"Now , gran@@ ted , for many men it may re@@ qu@@ ire a de@@ gre@@ e in phil@@ os@@ oph@@ y to see something wrong with these images ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the perf@@ ect ex@@ pression of psycho@@ log@@ ical bal@@ ance with resp@@ ect to vari@@ ables like y@@ ou@@ th and beau@@ ty and women &apos;s bo@@ dies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the opti@@ mal environment in which to rai@@ se our children ?"
"P@@ ro@@ bab@@ ly not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spec@@ tru@@ m between these two ex@@ tre@@ mes that repres@@ ents a place of better bal@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ haps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many p@@ ea@@ ks on the mor@@ al land@@ s@@ cap@@ e ."
But the thing to no@@ tice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a p@@ ea@@ k .
"Now the ir@@ on@@ y , from my perspective , is that the only people who se@@ em to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to mor@@ al questions are religi@@ ous dem@@ ag@@ o@@ gues of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ w@@ ers to mor@@ al questions because they got these ans@@ w@@ ers from a vo@@ ice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ w@@ ind , not because they made an intellig@@ ent analy@@ s@@ is of the cau@@ ses and condi@@ tion of human and animal w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ."
"In fact , the end@@ ur@@ ance of religion as a l@@ ens through which most people view mor@@ al questions has se@@ par@@ ated most mor@@ al talk from real questions of human and animal suff@@ ering ."
This is why we spend our time talking about things like g@@ ay mar@@ ri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or nuc@@ l@@ ear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or po@@ ver@@ ty or any other hu@@ g@@ ely conse@@ qu@@ enti@@ al issue .
But the dem@@ ag@@ o@@ gues are right about one thing : We need a univers@@ al concep@@ tion of human val@@ ues .
"Now , what st@@ ands in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to no@@ tice is that we do something different when talking about mor@@ ality — esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally sec@@ ular , ac@@ ad@@ em@@ ic , scienti@@ st types ."
Wh@@ en talking about mor@@ ality we value differ@@ ences of op@@ in@@ ion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
"So , for inst@@ ance the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ ama gets up every morning me@@ d@@ it@@ ating on compassion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ ping other human be@@ ings is an in@@ te@@ gr@@ al com@@ pon@@ ent of human happ@@ iness ."
"On the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy ; T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy was very fond of ab@@ duc@@ ting and rap@@ ing and tor@@ tur@@ ing and kill@@ ing young women ."
"So , we app@@ ear to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ in@@ ion about how to prof@@ it@@ ab@@ ly use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) Mo@@ st W@@ es@@ tern int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ als look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ ama to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real ar@@ gu@@ ment that potenti@@ ally fall@@ s within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He li@@ kes cho@@ col@@ ate , he li@@ kes v@@ an@@ il@@ la ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ ade the other . &quot; &quot; No@@ tice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
On the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a str@@ ing the@@ or@@ ist .
"If you ask the smar@@ test phys@@ ic@@ ists around who is the smar@@ test phys@@ ic@@ ist around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I sho@@ wed up at a phys@@ ics con@@ fer@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing the@@ ory is bo@@ g@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t res@@ on@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a phys@@ ic@@ ist ; I don &apos;t understand str@@ ing the@@ ory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy of str@@ ing the@@ ory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to bel@@ ong to any str@@ ing the@@ ory c@@ lu@@ b that would have me as a mem@@ ber .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ in@@ ions must be exc@@ lu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a dom@@ ain of exper@@ ti@@ se .
That is what it is for knowledge to coun@@ t .
"H@@ ow have we conv@@ inc@@ ed ourselves that in the mor@@ al sp@@ here there is no such thing as mor@@ al exper@@ ti@@ se , or mor@@ al tal@@ ent , or mor@@ al gen@@ i@@ us even ? How have we conv@@ inc@@ ed our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ in@@ ion has to coun@@ t ? How have we conv@@ inc@@ ed ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these subj@@ ects wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ?
D@@ o@@ es the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an have a point of view on phys@@ ics that is wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ign@@ or@@ ance any less obvi@@ ous on the subj@@ ect of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now ."
"It needs people like ourselves to ad@@ m@@ it that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to questions of human fl@@ our@@ ish@@ ing , and mor@@ ality rel@@ ates to that dom@@ ain of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for individu@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beli@@ e@@ fs and des@@ ires that reli@@ ab@@ ly l@@ ead to ne@@ ed@@ less human suff@@ ering ."
J@@ ust ad@@ m@@ itting this will trans@@ form our dis@@ course about mor@@ ality .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies between n@@ ations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world f@@ ill@@ ed with des@@ truc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ invent@@ ed ; it will always be eas@@ ier to brea@@ k things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It seems to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , pat@@ ently obvi@@ ous that we can no more resp@@ ect and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in no@@ tions of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being than we can resp@@ ect or t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in the no@@ tions about how disease sp@@ re@@ a@@ ds , or in the s@@ af@@ ety stand@@ ards of buil@@ dings and air@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must con@@ ver@@ ge on the ans@@ w@@ ers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ m@@ it that these questions have ans@@ w@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Chr@@ is An@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ bus@@ ti@@ ble material there ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther in this audience or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , hear@@ ing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ r@@ age thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ ang@@ u@@ age seems to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women dr@@ essed in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , spo@@ ken with a lot of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a cel@@ e@@ br@@ ation of fem@@ ale spec@@ i@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a resul@@ t of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is ar@@ gu@@ ab@@ ly a s@@ op@@ his@@ tic@@ ated psycho@@ log@@ ical view — &quot; that ma@@ le l@@ ust is not to be tru@@ st@@ ed . &quot;"
"I mean , can you eng@@ age in a conversation with that kind of woman without se@@ em@@ ing kind of cul@@ tural im@@ per@@ i@@ alis@@ t ?"
"S@@ am H@@ arr@@ is : Yeah , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a sent@@ ence , wat@@ ching the c@@ loc@@ k tic@@ king , but the question is : What is vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary in a cont@@ ext where men have certain exp@@ ect@@ ations , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to w@@ ear a ve@@ il , or a very fun@@ n@@ y h@@ at , or tat@@ too their face — I think we should be free to vol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily do whatever we want , but we have to be hon@@ est about the constr@@ ain@@ ts that these women are plac@@ ed under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ager to always take their word for it , esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re w@@ ear@@ ing a full bur@@ q@@ a ."
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of mor@@ al progr@@ ess .
But can you re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that ?
"I think I underst@@ ood you to say that you could re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimen@@ si@@ onal , where we all have to think the same ."
"P@@ ain@@ t your picture of what ro@@ l@@ ling the c@@ loc@@ k 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , bal@@ anc@@ ing mor@@ al progr@@ ess with ri@@ ch@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ m@@ it that we are on the pat@@ h to@@ ward understanding our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important det@@ ail , then you have to ad@@ m@@ it that we are going to understand all of the positive and ne@@ g@@ ative qu@@ ali@@ ties of ourselves in much gre@@ ater det@@ ail ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emo@@ tion like emp@@ ath@@ y and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that encour@@ age it — whether they &apos;re gen@@ e@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and in@@ so@@ far as we beg@@ in to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ab@@ ly going to con@@ ver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gr@@ ab@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my d@@ aughter from bir@@ th is just as good as tea@@ ching her to be confi@@ dent and w@@ ell@@ -@@ e@@ duc@@ ated in the cont@@ ext of men who do des@@ ire women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the br@@ ains of everyone invol@@ ved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
D@@ o people love their d@@ augh@@ ters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ w@@ ers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the resul@@ ts come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ par@@ ed to shi@@ ft your inst@@ inc@@ tive cur@@ rent ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these issu@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well y@@ eah , mod@@ ul@@ o one obvi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the cont@@ ext of a tru@@ ly del@@ u@@ si@@ onal beli@@ ef system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my g@@ ay son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a bo@@ y@@ friend , I ch@@ op@@ ped his head off . And that was the most compas@@ si@@ on@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts al@@ ign@@ ed , y@@ es I think you could probably be feeling the emo@@ tion of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about w@@ ell@@ -@@ being in a larg@@ er cont@@ ext ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ec@@ st@@ as@@ y and then blo@@ wing h@@ im@@ self up on a b@@ us ."
"C@@ A : S@@ am , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours ."
"We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED ."
S@@ H : Re@@ ally an hon@@ or . Thank you .

( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . It &apos;s a dist@@ inc@@ t priv@@ il@@ e@@ ge to be here .
"A few weeks ago , I saw a video on Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be of Con@@ gr@@ ess@@ woman G@@ ab@@ ri@@ elle G@@ i@@ ff@@ or@@ ds at the early st@@ ages of her re@@ co@@ very from one of those aw@@ ful bul@@ le@@ ts ."
"This one ent@@ ered her left h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere , and kno@@ c@@ ked out her B@@ ro@@ c@@ a &apos;s area , the spe@@ ech c@@ enter of her brain ."
"And in this s@@ ession , G@@ ab@@ by &apos;s working with a spe@@ ech ther@@ ap@@ ist , and she &apos;s stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing to produce some of the most bas@@ ic words , and you can see her growing more and more dev@@ as@@ t@@ ated , until she ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely brea@@ ks down into so@@ b@@ b@@ ing t@@ ear@@ s , and she star@@ ts so@@ b@@ b@@ ing wor@@ d@@ l@@ ess@@ ly into the ar@@ ms of her ther@@ ap@@ ist ."
"And after a few moments , her ther@@ ap@@ ist tries a new t@@ ack , and they start sing@@ ing together , and G@@ ab@@ by star@@ ts to sing through her t@@ ear@@ s , and you can hear her c@@ lear@@ ly able to en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate the words to a s@@ ong that descri@@ be the way she fe@@ els , and she s@@ ings , in one desc@@ ending scale , she s@@ ings , &quot; Let it sh@@ ine , let it sh@@ ine , let it sh@@ ine . &quot;"
"And it &apos;s a very powerful and po@@ ign@@ ant re@@ min@@ der of how the beau@@ ty of music has the ability to spea@@ k where words fai@@ l , in this case literally spea@@ k ."
"S@@ e@@ e@@ ing this video of G@@ ab@@ by G@@ i@@ ff@@ or@@ ds re@@ min@@ ded me of the work of D@@ r@@ . G@@ ot@@ t@@ fri@@ ed S@@ ch@@ l@@ au@@ g , one of the pre@@ em@@ in@@ ent neuro@@ scientists stu@@ d@@ ying music and the brain at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , and S@@ ch@@ l@@ au@@ g is a pro@@ pon@@ ent of a ther@@ ap@@ y called M@@ el@@ o@@ di@@ c In@@ t@@ on@@ ation Th@@ er@@ ap@@ y , which has become very popul@@ ar in music ther@@ ap@@ y now ."
"S@@ ch@@ l@@ au@@ g found that his str@@ o@@ ke vic@@ ti@@ ms who were ap@@ h@@ as@@ ic , could not form sent@@ ences of thre@@ e@@ - or four@@ -@@ word sent@@ ences , but they could still sing the ly@@ r@@ ics to a s@@ ong , whether it was &quot; &quot; H@@ app@@ y B@@ ir@@ th@@ day T@@ o You &quot; &quot; or their favor@@ ite s@@ ong by the E@@ ag@@ les or the R@@ oll@@ ing St@@ ones ."
"And after 70 hours of inten@@ sive sing@@ ing l@@ ess@@ ons , he found that the music was able to literally re@@ w@@ ire the br@@ ains of his patients and create a hom@@ olo@@ g@@ ous spe@@ ech c@@ enter in their right h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere to com@@ pens@@ ate for the left h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere &apos;s dam@@ age ."
"When I was 1@@ 7 , I vis@@ ited D@@ r@@ .

"But I had an ul@@ ter@@ i@@ or mo@@ tive of vis@@ iting G@@ ot@@ t@@ fri@@ ed S@@ ch@@ l@@ au@@ g , and it was this : that I was at a cro@@ ss@@ ro@@ a@@ ds in my life , trying to cho@@ ose between music and medic@@ ine ."
"I had just complet@@ ed my under@@ grad@@ u@@ ate , and I was working as a research ass@@ ist@@ ant at the la@@ b of D@@ enn@@ is S@@ el@@ k@@ o@@ e , stu@@ d@@ ying Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , and I had fall@@ en in love with neuro@@ science .

"I wanted to become a doc@@ tor like P@@ au@@ l F@@ ar@@ mer or R@@ ick H@@ o@@ des , these kind of f@@ ear@@ less men who go into places like H@@ ai@@ ti or E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia and work with A@@ I@@ D@@ S patients with multi@@ dru@@ g@@ -@@ res@@ ist@@ ant tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ s@@ is , or with children with dis@@ fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing c@@ anc@@ ers ."
"I wanted to become that kind of R@@ ed C@@ ro@@ ss doc@@ tor , that doc@@ tor without bor@@ ders ."
"On the other hand , I had play@@ ed the viol@@ in my entire life ."
Music for me was more than a pas@@ sion . It was ob@@ s@@ ession .
"It was oxy@@ g@@ en .

"And he said that there were still times when he w@@ ished he could go back and play the org@@ an the way he used to , and that for me , medic@@ al school could w@@ ait , but that the viol@@ in simply would not ."
"And after two more years of stu@@ d@@ ying music , I decided to sho@@ ot for the impossible before taking the M@@ C@@ A@@ T and appl@@ ying to medic@@ al school like a good In@@ di@@ an son to become the next D@@ r@@ .

"It was my first audi@@ tion , and after three days of pl@@ aying behind a scre@@ en in a tri@@ al week , I was off@@ ered the position ."
"And it was a dre@@ am .

"But a year later , I met another mus@@ ici@@ an who had also stu@@ died at Ju@@ illi@@ ard , one who prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly hel@@ ped me find my vo@@ ice and sh@@ ap@@ ed my identi@@ ty as a mus@@ ici@@ an ."
"N@@ ath@@ an@@ i@@ el A@@ y@@ ers was a dou@@ ble b@@ ass@@ ist at Ju@@ illi@@ ard , but he suff@@ ered a ser@@ ies of psycho@@ tic ep@@ is@@ o@@ des in his early 20@@ s , was tre@@ ated with th@@ or@@ az@@ ine at B@@ ell@@ ev@@ ue , and ended up living hom@@ el@@ ess on the stre@@ ets of S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es 30 years later ."

"And on the many times I saw N@@ ath@@ an@@ i@@ el on S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow , I wit@@ n@@ essed how music was able to bring him back from his very dar@@ k@@ est moments , from what se@@ em@@ ed to me in my un@@ tr@@ ained ey@@ e to be the beg@@ in@@ n@@ ings of a sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic ep@@ is@@ ode ."
"P@@ l@@ aying for N@@ ath@@ an@@ i@@ el , the music took on a de@@ e@@ per me@@ an@@ ing , because now it was about communication , a communication where words fai@@ led , a communication of a message that went de@@ e@@ per than words , that reg@@ is@@ ter@@ ed at a fundament@@ ally prim@@ al level in N@@ ath@@ an@@ i@@ el &apos;s psy@@ che , yet came as a true mus@@ ical off@@ ering from me ."
"I found myself growing ou@@ tr@@ ag@@ ed that someone like N@@ ath@@ an@@ i@@ el could have ever been hom@@ el@@ ess on S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow because of his mental ill@@ ness , yet how many t@@ ens of thousands of others there were out there on S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow alone who had stories as tr@@ ag@@ ic as his , but were never going to have a book or a mo@@ vie made about them that got them off the stre@@ ets ?"
"And at the very core of this cr@@ is@@ is of mine , I felt some@@ how the life of music had cho@@ s@@ en me , where some@@ how , perhaps possi@@ bly in a very n@@ ai@@ ve sense , I felt what S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow really needed was somebody like P@@ au@@ l F@@ ar@@ mer and not another cl@@ ass@@ ical mus@@ ici@@ an pl@@ aying on B@@ un@@ ker H@@ ill ."
"But in the end , it was N@@ ath@@ an@@ i@@ el who sho@@ wed me that if I was tru@@ ly pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the perf@@ ect in@@ stru@@ ment to do it , that music was the bri@@ dge that conn@@ ected my world and his ."

"A@@ f@@ ter one of our ev@@ ents at the P@@ att@@ on St@@ ate H@@ o@@ sp@@ ital in S@@ an B@@ er@@ n@@ ar@@ din@@ o , a woman wal@@ ked up to us and she had t@@ ear@@ s stre@@ am@@ ing down her face , and she had a pal@@ s@@ y , she was sh@@ a@@ king , and she had this g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous s@@ mi@@ le , and she said that she had never heard cl@@ ass@@ ical music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a viol@@ in before , but that hear@@ ing this music was like hear@@ ing the su@@ n@@ sh@@ ine , and that no@@ body ever came to vis@@ it them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she st@@ op@@ ped sh@@ a@@ king without medic@@ ation ."
"S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , what we &apos;re fin@@ ding with these concer@@ ts , away from the stage , away from the fo@@ ot@@ li@@ ghts , out of the tu@@ x@@ e@@ do t@@ ails , the mus@@ ici@@ ans become the condu@@ it for deli@@ ver@@ ing the t@@ rem@@ end@@ ous ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic bene@@ f@@ its of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room , would never have access to the kind of music that we make ."
"J@@ ust as medic@@ ine ser@@ ves to he@@ al more than the building bloc@@ ks of the body alone , the power and beau@@ ty of music trans@@ c@@ ends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our bel@@ o@@ ved ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m ."
Music trans@@ c@@ ends the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic beau@@ ty alone .
"The syn@@ ch@@ ron@@ y of emo@@ tions that we experience when we hear an op@@ era by W@@ ag@@ ner , or a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y by B@@ ra@@ h@@ ms , or cham@@ ber music by Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven , comp@@ els us to remember our shar@@ ed , common human@@ ity , the de@@ e@@ pl@@ y commun@@ al conn@@ ected consci@@ ous@@ ness , the emp@@ ath@@ ic consci@@ ous@@ ness that neuro@@ psy@@ chi@@ a@@ tr@@ ist I@@ ain M@@ c@@ G@@ il@@ ch@@ ris@@ t says is har@@ d-@@ wi@@ red into our brain &apos;s right h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere ."
"And for those living in the most de@@ human@@ iz@@ ing conditions of mental ill@@ ness within hom@@ el@@ ess@@ ness and in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , the music and the beau@@ ty of music off@@ ers a chance for them to trans@@ c@@ end the world around them , to remember that they still have the capac@@ ity to experience something beautiful and that human@@ ity has not for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten them ."
"And the s@@ par@@ k of that beau@@ ty , the s@@ par@@ k of that human@@ ity transform@@ s into hope , and we know , whether we cho@@ ose the pat@@ h of music or of medic@@ ine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must in@@ still within our communi@@ ties , within our audi@@ ences , if we want to insp@@ ire heal@@ ing from within ."
"I &apos;d like to end with a quot@@ e by John K@@ e@@ ats , the R@@ om@@ an@@ tic Engl@@ ish po@@ et , a very fam@@ ous quot@@ e that I &apos;m sure all of you know ."
"@@ K@@ e@@ ats h@@ im@@ self had also given up a care@@ er in medic@@ ine to pur@@ su@@ e po@@ e@@ try , but he died when he was a year ol@@ der than me ."
"And K@@ e@@ ats said , &quot; &quot; Be@@ aut@@ y is tru@@ th , and tru@@ th beau@@ ty ."
"That is all y@@ e know on Earth , and all y@@ e need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) ( Applause )"
"Th@@ ank you so much everyone from TED , and Chr@@ is and A@@ my in particular ."
I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
I have not s@@ le@@ pt in weeks .
"N@@ eil and I were sitting there compar@@ ing how little we &apos;ve s@@ le@@ pt in anti@@ cip@@ ation for this . I &apos;ve never been so ner@@ vous — and I do this when I &apos;m ner@@ vous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organiz@@ ation called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might j@@ oin in and do simil@@ ar things ."
"B@@ ack in about 2@@ 000 , I was living in B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ ly@@ n , I was trying to fin@@ ish my first book , I was wan@@ der@@ ing around d@@ az@@ ed every day because I wr@@ ote from 12 a@@ .@@ m@@ . to 5 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
So I would walk around in a d@@ az@@ e during the day .
"I had no mental ac@@ u@@ ity to spea@@ k of during the day , but I had fl@@ ex@@ i@@ ble hours ."
"In the B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ ly@@ n neigh@@ bor@@ hood that I li@@ ved in , Par@@ k S@@ lo@@ pe , there are a lot of wr@@ it@@ ers — it &apos;s like a very high per capit@@ a r@@ ati@@ o of wr@@ it@@ ers to normal people ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , I had gro@@ wn up around a lot of tea@@ chers ."
"My mo@@ m was a tea@@ cher , my s@@ ister became a tea@@ cher and after colle@@ ge so many of my friends went into tea@@ ching ."
"And so I was always hear@@ ing them talk about their lives and how inspir@@ ing they were , and they were really sort of the most har@@ d-@@ working and const@@ antly inspir@@ ing people I knew ."
"But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the stru@@ gg@@ les they were de@@ al@@ ing with ."
"And one of them was that so many of my friends that were tea@@ ching in city scho@@ ols were having trou@@ ble with their students ke@@ e@@ ping up at gr@@ ade level , in their read@@ ing and wr@@ iting in particular ."
"Now , so many of these students had come from hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds where Engl@@ ish isn &apos;t spo@@ ken in the home , where a lot of them have different spec@@ ial needs , learning dis@@ abil@@ ities . And of course they &apos;re working in scho@@ ols which sometimes and very often are under@@ -@@ fun@@ ded ."
"And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bo@@ dies , more on@@ e-@@ on-@@ one attention , more hours , more exper@@ ti@@ se from people that have sk@@ ills in Engl@@ ish and can work with these students on@@ e-@@ on-@@ one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them on@@ e-@@ on-@@ one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five clas@@ ses of 30 to 40 students each ."
"This can l@@ ead up to 1@@ 50 , 1@@ 80 , 200 students a day ."
How can we possi@@ bly give each stu@@ dent even one h@@ our a week of on@@ e-@@ on-@@ one attention ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to gre@@ at@@ ly multi@@ pl@@ y the wor@@ k@@ week and cl@@ one the tea@@ chers .
And so we started talking about this .
"And at the same time , I thought about this mas@@ sive group of people I knew : wr@@ it@@ ers , ed@@ it@@ ors , journ@@ alis@@ ts , grad@@ u@@ ate students , ass@@ ist@@ ant profess@@ ors , you name it ."
"A@@ ll these people that had sort of fl@@ ex@@ i@@ ble d@@ ai@@ ly hours and an inter@@ est in the Engl@@ ish word — I hope to have an inter@@ est in the Engl@@ ish language , but I &apos;m not spea@@ king it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That c@@ loc@@ k has got me ."
"But everyone that I knew had an inter@@ est in the prim@@ acy of the wr@@ it@@ ten word in terms of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing a demo@@ cr@@ acy , n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing an en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed life ."
"And so they had , you know , their time and their inter@@ est , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a condu@@ it that I knew of in my community to bring these two communi@@ ties together ."
"So when I mo@@ ved back to S@@ an Fr@@ anc@@ is@@ c@@ o , we r@@ ented this building ."
"And the idea was to put M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s — M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s Qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly , that we pu@@ bl@@ ished tw@@ ice or three times a year , and a few other mag@@ az@@ ines — we were going to move it into an off@@ ice for the first time ."
It used to be in my k@@ it@@ ch@@ en in B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ ly@@ n .
"We were going to move it into an off@@ ice , and we were going to actually share space with a tu@@ tor@@ ing c@@ enter ."
"So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these wr@@ it@@ ers and ed@@ it@@ ors and everybody — sort of a wr@@ iting community — coming into the off@@ ice every day any@@ way , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get extr@@ a help on their wr@@ it@@ ten hom@@ e@@ work , so you have basically no bor@@ der between these two communi@@ ties ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . the students f@@ low in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you tra@@ de , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is ."
You give those hours in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on to the students in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
"So , we had this place , we r@@ ented it , the land@@ l@@ or@@ d was all for it . We did this m@@ ural , that &apos;s a Chr@@ is W@@ are m@@ ural , that basically expl@@ ains the entire history of the prin@@ ted word , in m@@ ural form — it takes a long time to dig@@ est and you have to st@@ and in the middle of the ro@@ ad ."
So we r@@ ented this space .
"And everything was great excep@@ t the land@@ l@@ or@@ d said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is z@@ on@@ ed for ret@@ ail ; you have to come up with something ."
You &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ta s@@ ell something .
"You can &apos;t just have a tu@@ tor@@ ing c@@ enter . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; H@@ a h@@ a ! Re@@ ally ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily to s@@ ell , but we did all the nec@@ ess@@ ary research ."
"It used to be a we@@ ight room , so there were ru@@ b@@ ber flo@@ ors bel@@ ow , ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ c ti@@ le ce@@ il@@ ings and flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent li@@ ghts ."
"We took all that down , and we found beautiful w@@ oo@@ den flo@@ ors , wh@@ it@@ e@@ was@@ h@@ ed be@@ ams and it had the look — while we were ren@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the h@@ ul@@ l of a ship . &quot;"
"And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should s@@ ell suppl@@ ies to the working b@@ uc@@ can@@ e@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody l@@ aug@@ h , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that ."
Let &apos;s s@@ ell pir@@ ate suppl@@ ies . &quot; &quot; This is the pir@@ ate suppl@@ y sto@@ re .
"You see , this is sort of a sk@@ et@@ ch I did on a n@@ ap@@ k@@ in ."
"A great car@@ p@@ enter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pir@@ ate suppl@@ y-@@ like ."
Here you see plan@@ ks sol@@ d by the fo@@ ot and we have suppl@@ ies to comb@@ at sc@@ ur@@ v@@ y .
"We have the pe@@ g le@@ gs there , that are all hand@@ made and f@@ it@@ ted to you ."
"@@ U@@ p at the top , you see the ey@@ e@@ pat@@ ch dis@@ play , which is the black col@@ um@@ n there for every@@ day use for your ey@@ e@@ pat@@ ch , and then you have the pas@@ tel and other col@@ ors for st@@ ep@@ ping out at night — spec@@ ial oc@@ cas@@ ions , b@@ ar m@@ it@@ z@@ v@@ ah@@ s and whatever ."
So we op@@ en@@ ed this place . And this is a v@@ at that we f@@ ill with tre@@ a@@ su@@ res that students di@@ g in .
This is re@@ plac@@ ement eyes in case you lo@@ se one .
These are some sig@@ ns that we have all over the place : &quot; P@@ rac@@ tical Jo@@ king with P@@ ir@@ ates . &quot;
"Wh@@ ile you &apos;re read@@ ing the sig@@ n , we pul@@ l a ro@@ pe behind the coun@@ ter and eight mo@@ p hea@@ ds dro@@ p on your head ."
That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that dro@@ ps on people &apos;s hea@@ ds .
"It became mo@@ p hea@@ ds . And this is the fish the@@ ater , which is just a sal@@ tw@@ ater t@@ ank with three se@@ ats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tu@@ tor@@ ing c@@ enter ."
"So right there is the tu@@ tor@@ ing c@@ enter , and then behind the cur@@ t@@ ain were the M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s off@@ ices , where all of us would be working on the mag@@ az@@ ine and book ed@@ iting and things like that ."
The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
"We set the place up , we op@@ en@@ ed up , we spent months and months ren@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place ."
"We had t@@ ables , ch@@ ai@@ rs , compu@@ ters , everything ."
I went to a d@@ ot@@ -@@ co@@ m auc@@ tion at a H@@ o@@ li@@ day In@@ n in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to and I bou@@ ght 11 G@@ 4@@ s with a str@@ o@@ ke of a p@@ ad@@ d@@ le .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , we bou@@ ght &apos; em , we set everything up and then we w@@ ai@@ ted ."
"It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were wr@@ it@@ ers in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood ."
"And we s@@ at . And at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . we put a s@@ and@@ w@@ ich bo@@ ard out on the front si@@ de@@ walk and it just said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree T@@ u@@ tor@@ ing for Y@@ our Engl@@ ish@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated and W@@ r@@ it@@ ing@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated Ne@@ e@@ ds — J@@ ust Com@@ e In , It &apos;s All F@@ ree . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to st@@ or@@ m the g@@ ates , they &apos;re g@@ onn@@ a love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t ."
"And so we w@@ ai@@ ted , we s@@ at at the t@@ ables , we w@@ ai@@ ted and w@@ ai@@ ted ."
"And everybody was be@@ coming very dis@@ cour@@ ag@@ ed because it was weeks and weeks that we w@@ ai@@ ted , really , where no@@ body came in ."
"And then somebody al@@ er@@ ted us to the fact that maybe there was a tr@@ ust ga@@ p , because we were oper@@ ating behind a pir@@ ate suppl@@ y sto@@ re . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?"
"And so then , around that time , I per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed a woman nam@@ ed N@@ in@@ ev@@ e@@ h C@@ al@@ ig@@ ar@@ i , a long@@ time S@@ an Fr@@ anc@@ is@@ c@@ o e@@ duc@@ ator — she was tea@@ ching in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity , she had all the experience nec@@ ess@@ ary , knew everything about education , was conn@@ ected with all the tea@@ chers and community mem@@ bers in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood — I conv@@ inc@@ ed her to move up from M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity where she was tea@@ ching ."
She took over as ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive direc@@ tor .
"I@@ m@@ medi@@ ately , she made the in@@ ro@@ a@@ ds with the tea@@ chers and the parents and the students and everything , and so sudd@@ en@@ ly it was actually full every day ."
And what we were trying to off@@ er every day was on@@ e-@@ on-@@ one attention .
The go@@ al was to have a on@@ e-@@ to-@@ one r@@ ati@@ o with every one of these students .
"You know , it &apos;s been pro@@ ven that 3@@ 5 to 40 hours a year with on@@ e-@@ on-@@ one attention , a stu@@ dent can get one gr@@ ade level high@@ er ."
"And so most of these students , Engl@@ ish is not spo@@ ken in the home ."
"They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a ch@@ ur@@ ch pe@@ w that I bou@@ ght in a B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey auc@@ tion right there — the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"So that was the bas@@ is of it , was on@@ e-@@ on-@@ one attention ."
And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
"If you &apos;re on V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a S@@ tre@@ et within those few bloc@@ ks at around 2 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big back@@ p@@ ac@@ ks , or whatever , actually run@@ ning to this space , which is very str@@ ange , because it &apos;s school , in a way ."
But there was something psycho@@ log@@ ical happening there that was just a little bit different .
"And the other thing was , there was no sti@@ g@@ ma ."
"@@ K@@ ids wer@@ en &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; C@@ ent@@ er@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ K@@ id@@ s-@@ Th@@ at@@ -@@ Ne@@ ed@@ -@@ Mo@@ re-@@ H@@ el@@ p , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it was a pir@@ ate suppl@@ y sto@@ re , which is in@@ san@@ e ."
"And then secon@@ d@@ ly , there &apos;s a pu@@ bl@@ ish@@ ing company in the back ."
"And so our inter@@ ns were actually working at the same t@@ ables very often , and sh@@ oul@@ der@@ -@@ to-@@ sh@@ oul@@ der , compu@@ ter@@ -@@ n@@ ex@@ t-@@ to-@@ computer with the students ."
"And so it became a tu@@ tor@@ ing c@@ enter — pu@@ bl@@ ish@@ ing c@@ enter , is what we called it — and a wr@@ iting c@@ enter ."
"They go in , and they might be working with a high school stu@@ dent actually working on a nov@@ el — because we had very gi@@ f@@ ted kids , too ."
So there &apos;s no sti@@ g@@ ma .
They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a cre@@ ative end@@ e@@ av@@ or .
They &apos;re seeing adul@@ ts . They &apos;re mod@@ eling their behavior .
"These adul@@ ts , they &apos;re working in their field ."
"They can le@@ an over , ask a question of one of these adul@@ ts and it all sort of fe@@ e@@ ds on each other ."
"There &apos;s a lot of cro@@ ss@@ -@@ pol@@ lin@@ ation . The only problem , esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally for the adul@@ ts working at M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s who h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily bou@@ ght into all of this when they sig@@ ned up , was that there was just the one b@@ ath@@ room . ( Laughter ) W@@ ith like 60 kids a day , this is a problem ."
"But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids fin@@ ish@@ ing their hom@@ e@@ work in a given day , working on@@ e-@@ on-@@ one , getting all this attention — they go home , they &apos;re fin@@ ished . They don &apos;t st@@ all ."
They don &apos;t do their hom@@ e@@ work in front of the T@@ V .
"They &apos;re al@@ lowed to go home at 5 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , en@@ jo@@ y their family , en@@ jo@@ y other h@@ ob@@ bi@@ es , get outside , play ."
And that makes a happy family .
A b@@ unch of happy famil@@ ies in a neigh@@ bor@@ hood is a happy community .
A b@@ unch of happy communi@@ ties ti@@ ed together is a happy city and a happy world .
"So the key to it all is hom@@ e@@ work ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — on@@ e-@@ on-@@ one attention ."
"So we started off with about 12 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundre@@ d ."
"And we now have 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers on our ro@@ st@@ er ."
And we make it incredi@@ bly easy to vol@@ un@@ te@@ er .
"The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a mon@@ th , those two hours sh@@ oul@@ der@@ -@@ to-@@ sh@@ oul@@ der , next to one stu@@ dent , concentr@@ ated attention , sh@@ in@@ ing this b@@ ea@@ m of light on their work , on their thou@@ ghts and their self-@@ ex@@ pression , is going to be absolu@@ tely transform@@ ative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before ."
"So we said , &quot; &quot; E@@ ven if you have two hours one S@@ un@@ day every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s part@@ ly why the tu@@ tor corps gre@@ w so fast ."
"Th@@ en we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . ? &quot; &quot; So we started br@@ ing@@ ing in clas@@ ses during the day ."
"So every day , there &apos;s a field tri@@ p where they together create a book — you can see it being ty@@ ped up abo@@ ve ."
This is one of the clas@@ ses getting way too exc@@ ited about wr@@ iting .
"You just point a cam@@ era at a clas@@ s , and it always looks like this ."
So this is one of the books that they do .
"N@@ o@@ tice the ti@@ tle of the book , &quot; The Bo@@ ok That W@@ as N@@ ever Ch@@ ec@@ ked O@@ ut : T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot;"
"And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce there was a book nam@@ ed C@@ in@@ dy that was about the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot; &quot; So , me@@ an@@ while , there &apos;s an adul@@ t in the back ty@@ ping this up , taking it completely ser@@ i@@ ously , which blo@@ ws their mind ."
So then we still had more tu@@ tors to use .
This is a sho@@ t of just some of the tu@@ tors during one of the ev@@ ents .
The tea@@ chers that we work with — and everything is different to tea@@ chers — they tell us what to do .
"We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , completely mal@@ le@@ able . You &apos;re going to tell us ."
"The neigh@@ bor@@ hood &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us ."
"The tea@@ chers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most us@@ e@@ ful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the scho@@ ols ?"
"Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily , who don &apos;t have really active parents that are br@@ ing@@ ing them in , or ar@@ en &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 people on our tu@@ tor ro@@ st@@ er ."
"L@@ et &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A tea@@ cher will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tu@@ tors for the next five S@@ un@@ days ."
"We &apos;re working on our colle@@ ge ess@@ ays . S@@ end them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the w@@ ire : 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 tu@@ tors ."
Wh@@ o@@ ever can make it sig@@ ns up . They go in about a half an h@@ our before the clas@@ s .
"The tea@@ cher tel@@ ls them what to do , how to do it , what their tr@@ aining is , what their project is so far ."
"They work under the tea@@ cher &apos;s gu@@ ide , and it &apos;s all in one big room ."
"And that &apos;s actually the br@@ un@@ t of what we do is , people going str@@ ai@@ ght from their wor@@ k@@ place , str@@ ai@@ ght from home , str@@ ai@@ ght into the cl@@ ass@@ room and working direc@@ tly with the students ."
So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
"Th@@ en another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a cl@@ ass@@ room and you can st@@ af@@ f it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the E@@ ver@@ et@@ t M@@ id@@ d@@ le S@@ cho@@ ol W@@ r@@ it@@ ers &apos; R@@ o@@ om , where we dec@@ or@@ ated it in b@@ uc@@ can@@ e@@ er st@@ y@@ le ."
It &apos;s right off the li@@ br@@ ary . And there we ser@@ ve all 5@@ 2@@ 9 kids in this middle school .
"This is their ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er , the &quot; &quot; S@@ trai@@ gh@@ t-@@ U@@ p Ne@@ ws , &quot; &quot; that has an on@@ going col@@ um@@ n from M@@ ay@@ or G@@ av@@ in Ne@@ w@@ so@@ m in both langu@@ ages — Engl@@ ish and S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"So then one day Is@@ ab@@ el Al@@ l@@ en@@ de wr@@ ote to us and said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why don &apos;t you as@@ sig@@ n a book with high school students ?"
"I want them to wr@@ ite about how to ach@@ i@@ eve p@@ ea@@ ce in a viol@@ ent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Th@@ ur@@ good Mar@@ sh@@ all H@@ igh S@@ cho@@ ol , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that as@@ sign@@ ment to the students ."
"And we said , &quot; &quot; Is@@ ab@@ el Al@@ l@@ en@@ de is going to read all your ess@@ ays at the end ."
She &apos;s going to pu@@ bl@@ ish them in a book .
She &apos;s going to s@@ pon@@ s@@ or the prin@@ ting of this book in pap@@ er@@ back form .
"It &apos;s going to be av@@ ail@@ able in all the boo@@ k@@ st@@ or@@ es in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a and thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the world , on A@@ ma@@ z@@ on and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audience , there was Is@@ ab@@ el Al@@ l@@ en@@ de on the other end ."
I think we had about 1@@ 70 tu@@ tors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredi@@ bly well .
We had a big par@@ ty at the end .
This is a book that you can find any@@ where . So that led to a ser@@ ies of these .
"You can see A@@ my T@@ an s@@ pon@@ so@@ red the next one , &quot; I Mi@@ ght G@@ et S@@ ome@@ where . &quot;"
And this became an on@@ going thing . Mo@@ re and more books .
Now we &apos;re sort of ad@@ dic@@ ted to the book thing .
"The kids will work har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be per@@ man@@ ent , know it &apos;s going to be on a sh@@ el@@ f , know that no@@ body can di@@ min@@ ish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve hon@@ o@@ red their words , hon@@ o@@ red their thou@@ ghts with hundreds of hours of five dra@@ f@@ ts , six dra@@ f@@ ts — all this attention that we give to their thou@@ ghts ."
"And once they ach@@ i@@ eve that level , once they &apos;ve wr@@ it@@ ten at that level , they can never go back ."
It &apos;s absolu@@ tely transform@@ ative .
And so then they &apos;re all sol@@ d in the sto@@ re . This is n@@ ear the plan@@ ks .
We s@@ ell all the stu@@ dent books .
"Wh@@ ere else would you put them , right ?"
"So we s@@ ell &apos; em , and then something we@@ ird had been happening with the st@@ or@@ es . The sto@@ re , actually — even though we started out as just a ga@@ g — the sto@@ re actually made money ."
So it was p@@ aying the rent .
"And maybe this is just a S@@ an Fr@@ anc@@ is@@ c@@ o thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to ju@@ dge ."
But people would come in — and this was before the pir@@ ate mo@@ vies and everything !
"It was making a lot of money . N@@ ot a lot of money , but it was p@@ aying the rent , p@@ aying a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time st@@ af@@ f mem@@ ber there ."
There &apos;s the ocean m@@ ap@@ s you can see on the left .
And it became a g@@ at@@ e@@ way to the community .
"P@@ eople would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?"
What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to s@@ w@@ ear on the web . ( Laughter ) I@@ s that a ru@@ le ? I don &apos;t know .
"They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it ."
"And then right be@@ y@@ ond — there &apos;s usu@@ ally a little ch@@ ain there — right be@@ y@@ ond , they would see the kids being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"This is a field tri@@ p going on . And so they would be sh@@ op@@ ping , and they might be more lik@@ ely to buy some l@@ ard , or m@@ ill@@ et for their par@@ ro@@ t , or , you know , a ho@@ ok , or ho@@ ok prot@@ ect@@ or for ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time , all of these things we s@@ ell ."
So the sto@@ re actually did really well .
"But it brought in so many people — tea@@ chers , don@@ ors , vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , everybody — because it was stre@@ et level . It was open to the public ."
"It wasn &apos;t a non-@@ prof@@ it bu@@ ried , you know , on the 3@@ 0@@ th flo@@ or of some building do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn . It was right in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood that it was ser@@ ving , and it was open all the time to the public ."
"So , it became this sort of we@@ ird , happy ac@@ cident ."
"So all the people I used to know in B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ ly@@ n , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;"
"And a lot of them had been form@@ er e@@ duc@@ at@@ ors or w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be e@@ duc@@ at@@ ors , so they combin@@ ed with a lot of local design@@ ers , local wr@@ it@@ ers , and they just took the idea in@@ depend@@ ently and they did their own thing ."
They didn &apos;t want to s@@ ell pir@@ ate suppl@@ ies .
They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
"So , kno@@ wing the cri@@ me@@ -@@ fi@@ gh@@ ting community in New York , they op@@ en@@ ed the B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ ly@@ n Su@@ per@@ her@@ o Su@@ ppl@@ y Com@@ p@@ any ."
This is S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts &apos; great design that did this .
"And this was to make it look sort of like one of those ke@@ y@@ sm@@ ith &apos;s sh@@ op@@ s that has to have every service they &apos;ve ever off@@ ered , you know , all over there ."
"So they op@@ en@@ ed this place . In@@ side , it &apos;s like a Co@@ st@@ c@@ o for super@@ her@@ o@@ es — all the suppl@@ ies in kind of bas@@ ic form ."
These are all hand@@ made .
"These are all sort of re@@ pur@@ posed other produc@@ ts , or whatever ."
All the p@@ ack@@ ag@@ ing is done by S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts .
"So then you have the vill@@ ain cont@@ ain@@ ment un@@ it , where kids put their parents . You have the off@@ ice ."
"This is a little v@@ au@@ l@@ t — you have to put your produc@@ t in there , it goes up an el@@ ec@@ tri@@ c li@@ ft and then the guy behind the coun@@ ter tel@@ ls you that you have to rec@@ ite the vo@@ w of her@@ o@@ ism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . And it lim@@ its , really , their s@@ ales ."
"P@@ ers@@ on@@ ally , I think it &apos;s a problem ."
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
These are some of the produc@@ ts . These are all hand@@ made .
This is a secre@@ t identi@@ ty k@@ it .
"If you want to take on the identi@@ ty of S@@ har@@ on Bo@@ one , one American fem@@ ale mark@@ eting ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive from H@@ o@@ bo@@ ken , New J@@ er@@ se@@ y . It &apos;s a full do@@ ssi@@ er on everything you would need to know about S@@ har@@ on Bo@@ one ."
"So , this is the cap@@ ery where you get f@@ it@@ ted for your cap@@ e , and then you walk up these three ste@@ el@@ -@@ grad@@ ed ste@@ ps and then we turn on three hy@@ dr@@ au@@ li@@ c f@@ ans from every side and then you can see the cap@@ e in action ."
"There &apos;s nothing wor@@ se than , you know , getting up there and the cap@@ e is b@@ un@@ ching up or something like that ."
"So then , the secre@@ t do@@ or — this is one of the sh@@ el@@ ves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it s@@ low@@ ly op@@ ens ."
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grap@@ pl@@ ing ho@@ o@@ ks .
It op@@ ens and then this is the tu@@ tor@@ ing c@@ enter in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full eff@@ ect !
"But this is — I just want to em@@ ph@@ as@@ ize — loc@@ ally fun@@ ded , loc@@ ally built ."
"A@@ ll the design@@ ers , all of the buil@@ ders , everybody was local , all the time was pro@@ -@@ bon@@ o ."
"I just came and vis@@ ited and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tu@@ tor@@ ing hours ."
"It &apos;s very bus@@ y . S@@ ame princip@@ les : on@@ e-@@ on-@@ one attention , comple@@ te dev@@ o@@ tion to the students &apos; work and a b@@ oun@@ d@@ less opti@@ mis@@ m and sort of a possibil@@ ity of cre@@ ativ@@ ity and ideas ."
"And this s@@ wit@@ ch is f@@ lic@@ ked in their hea@@ ds when they walk through those 18 feet of this bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re sto@@ re , right ?"
"So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school ."
"It &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly not school , even though they &apos;re working sh@@ oul@@ der@@ -@@ to-@@ sh@@ oul@@ der on t@@ ables , pen@@ c@@ ils and pap@@ ers , whatever ."
"This is one of the students , K@@ hal@@ ed H@@ am@@ d@@ an ."
You can read this quot@@ e .
A@@ d@@ dic@@ ted to video gam@@ es and T@@ V . C@@ ouldn &apos;t concentr@@ ate at home .
C@@ ame in . G@@ ot this concentr@@ ated attention .
And he couldn &apos;t es@@ cap@@ e it .
"So , so@@ on enough , he was wr@@ iting . He would fin@@ ish his hom@@ e@@ work early — got really ad@@ dic@@ ted to fin@@ ish@@ ing his hom@@ e@@ work early ."
"It &apos;s an ad@@ dic@@ tive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it ch@@ ec@@ ked , and to know he &apos;s going to ach@@ i@@ eve the next thing and be pre@@ par@@ ed for school the next day ."
"So he got ho@@ o@@ ked on that , and then he started doing other things ."
He &apos;s now been pu@@ bl@@ ished in five books .
"He co@@ -@@ wr@@ ote a mo@@ ck@@ um@@ ent@@ ary about fai@@ led super@@ her@@ o@@ es called &quot; &quot; Su@@ per@@ -@@ H@@ as@@ -@@ Be@@ ens . &quot; &quot; He wr@@ ote a ser@@ ies on &quot; &quot; P@@ en@@ gu@@ in B@@ al@@ bo@@ a , &quot; &quot; which is a fi@@ gh@@ ting — a bo@@ x@@ ing — pen@@ gu@@ in ."
"And then he read al@@ oud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at S@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y S@@ p@@ ace , at a bene@@ fit for 8@@ 2@@ 6 New York . So he &apos;s there every day ."
He &apos;s ev@@ ang@@ el@@ ical about it . He br@@ ings his cou@@ s@@ ins in now .
There &apos;s four family mem@@ bers that come in every day .
"So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly ."
"This is L@@ .@@ A@@ . , The E@@ ch@@ o Par@@ k T@@ i@@ me Tr@@ av@@ el M@@ art : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en@@ ever You A@@ re , We &apos;re Al@@ ready Th@@ en . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7@@ -@@ E@@ l@@ even for time trav@@ el@@ ers ."
So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7@@ -@@ E@@ l@@ even would be .
Le@@ e@@ ches . M@@ am@@ mot@@ h ch@@ un@@ ks . They even have their own S@@ l@@ ur@@ pe@@ e machine : &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of O@@ r@@ der . Com@@ e B@@ ack Y@@ es@@ ter@@ day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) An@@ y@@ way . So I &apos;m going to j@@ um@@ p a@@ head .
"These are sp@@ aces that are only aff@@ ili@@ ated with us , doing this same thing : Wor@@ d St@@ . in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ field , M@@ ass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts ; In@@ k S@@ po@@ t in C@@ inc@@ in@@ nat@@ i ; Y@@ ou@@ th S@@ p@@ ea@@ ks , S@@ an Fr@@ anc@@ is@@ c@@ o , Califor@@ ni@@ a , which insp@@ i@@ red us ; S@@ tu@@ di@@ o St@@ .

Now I &apos;m going to the TED W@@ ish — is that o@@ kay ?
"A@@ ll right , I &apos;ve got a minute . So , the TED W@@ ish : I w@@ ish that you — you pers@@ on@@ ally and every cre@@ ative individual and organiz@@ ation you know — will find a way to direc@@ tly eng@@ age with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got invol@@ ved , so that within a year we have a thou@@ sand exam@@ ples — a thou@@ sand ! — of transform@@ ative part@@ ner@@ shi@@ ps ."
Pro@@ found le@@ ap@@ s forward !
And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
"I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and insp@@ ire others on the we@@ b@@ site ."
We created a we@@ b@@ site .
"I &apos;m going to s@@ wit@@ ch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the attend@@ e@@ es of this con@@ fer@@ ence will us@@ her in a new era of particip@@ ation in our public scho@@ ols ."
We hope that you will take the l@@ ead in part@@ ner@@ ing your innov@@ ative spir@@ it and exper@@ ti@@ se with that of innov@@ ative e@@ duc@@ at@@ ors in your community .
Al@@ ways let the tea@@ chers l@@ ead the way .
They will tell you how to be us@@ e@@ ful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
There are a million ways .
You can walk up to your local school and con@@ sul@@ t with the tea@@ chers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
"So , this is with H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o in S@@ an Fr@@ anc@@ is@@ c@@ o , they did this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al job ."
"This we@@ b@@ site is already up , it &apos;s already got a b@@ unch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce U@@ pon a S@@ cho@@ ol , &quot; &quot; which is a great ti@@ tle , I think ."
"This site will do@@ cu@@ ment every story , every project that comes out of this con@@ fer@@ ence and around the world . So you go to the we@@ b@@ site , you see a b@@ unch of ideas you can be insp@@ i@@ red by and then you ad@@ d your own proj@@ ects once you get started ."
"H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o did a great job in a very ti@@ ght d@@ ea@@ d@@ line . So , vis@@ it the site ."
"If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our direc@@ tor of national program@@ s . He &apos;ll be on the phone ."
"You em@@ ail him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possi@@ bly want ."
And he &apos;ll get you insp@@ i@@ red and get you going and gu@@ ide you through the process so that you can aff@@ ect change .
And it can be f@@ un ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it nee@@ dn &apos;t be st@@ er@@ ile . It nee@@ dn &apos;t be bure@@ au@@ crati@@ c@@ ally un@@ ten@@ able .
You can do and use the sk@@ ills that you have .
The scho@@ ols need you . The tea@@ chers need you .
"S@@ tu@@ dents and parents need you . They need your actu@@ al person : your physical pers@@ on@@ hood and your open min@@ ds and open ear@@ s and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less compassion , sitting next to them , lis@@ ten@@ ing and no@@ d@@ ding and as@@ king questions for hours at a time ."
S@@ ome of these kids just don &apos;t pl@@ ain know how good they are : how smar@@ t and how much they have to say .
"You can tell them . You can sh@@ ine that light on them , one human inter@@ action at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll j@@ oin us ."
Thank you so much .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
And I say &quot; &quot; th@@ ank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was sil@@ ent for 1@@ 7 years .
"And the first words that I spo@@ ke were in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , on the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth D@@ ay ."
And my family and friends had ga@@ ther@@ ed there to hear me spea@@ k .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audience , she j@@ um@@ ped up , &quot; H@@ all@@ el@@ u@@ j@@ ah , Joh@@ n@@ n@@ y ’ s talking ! &quot;"
"( Laughter ) I@@ mag@@ ine if you were qui@@ et for 1@@ 7 years and your mother was out in the audience , say ."
"My d@@ ad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll expl@@ ain that ."
But I turned around because I didn ’ t recogni@@ ze where my vo@@ ice was coming from .
"I h@@ ad@@ n ’ t heard my vo@@ ice in 1@@ 7 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;"
"And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of l@@ augh@@ ed ."
"And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is cr@@ az@@ y . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this jour@@ ney ."
"And the jour@@ ney , I believe , is a met@@ ap@@ h@@ or for all of our jour@@ ne@@ ys ."
"E@@ ven though this one is kind of un@@ usu@@ al , I want you to think about your own jour@@ ney ."
"My jour@@ ney began in 19@@ 7@@ 1 when I wit@@ n@@ essed two oil t@@ an@@ kers col@@ li@@ de bene@@ ath the G@@ ol@@ den G@@ ate , and a half a million g@@ allons of oil sp@@ ill@@ ed into the b@@ ay ."
It dis@@ tur@@ bed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in mot@@ or@@ iz@@ ed ve@@ hic@@ les .
That ’ s a big thing in Califor@@ ni@@ a .
"And it was a big thing in my little community of P@@ o@@ int R@@ eyes St@@ ation in In@@ vern@@ ess , Califor@@ ni@@ a , because there were only about 3@@ 50 people there in the win@@ ter – this was back in &apos; 7@@ 1 now ."
"And so when I came in and I started wal@@ king around , people — they just knew what was going on ."
"And people would dri@@ ve up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m wal@@ king for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re wal@@ king to make us look bad , right ?"
"You ’ re wal@@ king to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some tru@@ th to that , because I thought that if I started wal@@ king , everyone would fol@@ low ."
"Because of the oil , everybody tal@@ ked about the pol@@ l@@ lu@@ tion ."
"And so I ar@@ gu@@ ed with people about that , I ar@@ gu@@ ed and I ar@@ gu@@ ed ."
I called my parents up .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in cars . &quot; &quot; My d@@ ad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then ."
They ’ re back in Ph@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ ph@@ ia .
"And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ thers are like that ."
"And so , on my 2@@ 7@@ th bir@@ th@@ day I decided , because I ar@@ gu@@ ed so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop spea@@ king for just one day — one day — to give it a rest ."
And so I did .
I got up in the morning and I didn ’ t say a word .
"And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began lis@@ ten@@ ing — in a long time ."
"And what I heard , it kind of dis@@ tur@@ bed me ."
"Because what I used to do , when I thought I was lis@@ ten@@ ing , was I would l@@ ist@@ en just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I st@@ op@@ ped lis@@ ten@@ ing ."
"And in my mind , I just kind of rac@@ ed a@@ head and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still fin@@ ish@@ ing up ."
And then I would l@@ aun@@ ch in .
"Well , that just ended communication ."
So on this first day I actually lis@@ ten@@ ed .
"And it was very s@@ ad for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning ."
I was 2@@ 7 . I thought I knew everything .
I didn ’ t .
"And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I prom@@ is@@ ed myself for a year I would keep qui@@ et because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more ."
"So for a year I said I would keep qui@@ et , and then on my bir@@ th@@ day I would re@@ ass@@ ess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again ."
"Well , that l@@ as@@ ted 1@@ 7 years ."
"Now during that time — those 1@@ 7 years — I wal@@ ked and I play@@ ed the ban@@ j@@ o and I pain@@ ted and I wr@@ ote in my journ@@ al , and I tried to study the environment by read@@ ing books ."
And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
"I wal@@ ked up to A@@ sh@@ land , O@@ reg@@ on , where they were off@@ ering an environ@@ mental stu@@ dies de@@ gre@@ e ."
It ’ s only 500 miles .
"And I went into the Re@@ g@@ istr@@ ar ’ s off@@ ice and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;"
I had a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er cli@@ p@@ ping .
"&quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?"
You don ’ t … ?
We have a spec@@ ial program for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
"And in those two years , I grad@@ u@@ ated with my first de@@ gre@@ e — a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ."
"And my father came out , he was so pr@@ oud ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , we ’ re really pr@@ oud of you son , but what are you going to do with a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ?"
"You don ’ t ri@@ de in cars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hun@@ ched my sh@@ oul@@ der , I pic@@ ked my back@@ p@@ ack up again and I started wal@@ king ."
"I wal@@ ked all the way up to P@@ ort T@@ ow@@ n@@ s@@ end , W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , where I built a w@@ oo@@ den bo@@ at , ro@@ de it across P@@ u@@ get S@@ ound and wal@@ ked across W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton &#91; to &#93; I@@ d@@ ah@@ o and down to M@@ is@@ sou@@ la , Mon@@ t@@ ana ."
I had wr@@ it@@ ten the Uni@@ versity of Mon@@ t@@ ana two years ear@@ li@@ er and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
( Laughter ) And I was there . I sho@@ wed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really hel@@ ped me .
There are two stories in Mon@@ t@@ ana .
The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sig@@ n I used a lot .
"And they said , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that . &quot; &quot; The direc@@ tor of the program said , &quot; &quot; Com@@ e back tom@@ or@@ row . &quot; &quot; He gave me 1@@ 50 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Re@@ g@@ ister for one cre@@ dit ."
"You ’ re going to go to Sou@@ th America , ar@@ en ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Ri@@ vers and la@@ kes , the hy@@ dro@@ log@@ ical systems , Sou@@ th America ."
So I did that .
"He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK John , now that you &apos;ve reg@@ is@@ ter@@ ed for that one cre@@ dit , you can have a key to an off@@ ice , you can ma@@ tr@@ icul@@ ate — you ’ re ma@@ tr@@ icul@@ ating , so you can use the li@@ br@@ ary ."
"And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the profess@@ ors al@@ low you to go to clas@@ s ."
"They ’ re going to s@@ ave your gr@@ ade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can reg@@ ister for that clas@@ s and they ’ ll give you the gr@@ ade . &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , they don ’ t do that in grad@@ u@@ ate scho@@ ols , I don ’ t think ."
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
"They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way ."
"And during that time , I actually t@@ au@@ ght clas@@ ses without spea@@ king ."
I had 1@@ 3 students when I first wal@@ ked into the clas@@ s .
"I expl@@ ained , with a friend who could inter@@ pre@@ t my sig@@ n language , that I was John Fr@@ anc@@ is , I was wal@@ king around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here inter@@ pre@@ ting for me ."
All the students s@@ at around and they went ...
"( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the s@@ che@@ du@@ le , to see when they could get out ."
They had to take that clas@@ s with me .
"T@@ w@@ o weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our clas@@ s ."
And I learned in that clas@@ s — because I would do things like this ...
"@@ and they were all ga@@ ther@@ ed around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear cu@@ tting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear cu@@ tting . &quot;"
"&quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear cu@@ tting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a hand@@ saw . &quot;"
"&quot; Well , you can ’ t c@@ lear@@ cut with a ... &quot;"
"&quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;"
"&quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about sel@@ ec@@ tive for@@ es@@ try . &quot;"
Now this was a discus@@ sion clas@@ s and we were having a discus@@ sion .
"I just b@@ ac@@ ked out of that , you know , and I just kind of ke@@ pt the f@@ ists from fl@@ ying ."
"But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sig@@ n and they said things that I absolu@@ tely did not mean , but I should have ."
"And so what came to me is , if you were a tea@@ cher and you were tea@@ ching , if you wer@@ en ’ t learning you probably wer@@ en ’ t tea@@ ching very well ."
And so I went on .
"My d@@ ad came out to see me grad@@ u@@ ate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really pr@@ oud of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving and start talking ."
"What are you going to do with a mas@@ ter ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ? &quot; &quot; I hun@@ ched my sh@@ oul@@ der , I got my back@@ p@@ ack and I went on to the Uni@@ versity of W@@ is@@ cons@@ in ."
I spent two years there wr@@ iting on oil sp@@ ills .
No one was interested in oil sp@@ ills .
But something happened — Ex@@ x@@ on V@@ al@@ d@@ ez .
And I was the only one in the United States wr@@ iting on oil sp@@ ills .
My d@@ ad came out again .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ri@@ de in cars , you don ’ t talk ."
"My s@@ ister said maybe I should leave you alone , because you se@@ em to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my back@@ p@@ ack again ."
"I put my ban@@ j@@ o on and I wal@@ ked all the way to the E@@ ast Co@@ ast , put my fo@@ ot in the A@@ t@@ l@@ an@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States ."
"And on Earth D@@ ay , 199@@ 0 — the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth D@@ ay — that ’ s when I began to spea@@ k ."
"And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that t@@ ree in the for@@ est fall@@ ing ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?"
"And I ’ m th@@ an@@ king you , and I &apos;m th@@ an@@ king my family because they had come to hear me spea@@ k ."
And that ’ s communication .
And they also t@@ au@@ ght me about lis@@ ten@@ ing — that they lis@@ ten@@ ed to me .
"And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the sil@@ ence , the lis@@ ten@@ ing to each other ."
"@@ Re@@ ally , very important — we need to l@@ ist@@ en to each other ."
"Well , my jour@@ ney ke@@ pt going on ."
"My d@@ ad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go ."
"I worked for the Co@@ as@@ t@@ gu@@ ard , was made a U.@@ N@@ . Goo@@ d@@ will Am@@ b@@ ass@@ ad@@ or ."
"I wr@@ ote reg@@ ul@@ ations for the United States — I mean , I wr@@ ote oil sp@@ ill reg@@ ul@@ ations ."
"@@ 20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; John , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;"
"&quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; You just start wal@@ king e@@ ast ; get out of your car and just start wal@@ king e@@ ast . &quot; &quot; And as I wal@@ ked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and sh@@ ut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , bu@@ d@@ dy . &quot;"
"H@@ ow could that be , how could that be ?"
How could doing such a simple thing like wal@@ king and not talking make a difference ?
"Well , my time at the Co@@ ast Gu@@ ard was a really good time ."
"And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a s@@ ail@@ bo@@ at and I s@@ ail@@ ed down to the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , and wal@@ ked through all of the is@@ l@@ ands , and to V@@ en@@ e@@ z@@ u@@ ela ."
"And you know , I for@@ got the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you ."
I started talking because I had stu@@ died environment .
"I ’ d stu@@ died environment at this form@@ al level , but there was this inform@@ al level ."
"And the inform@@ al level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are ."
And environment changed from just being about tre@@ es and bir@@ ds and end@@ anger@@ ed species to being about how we tre@@ ated each other .
"Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we tre@@ at ourselves and how we tre@@ at each other ."
And so that ’ s the message that I had .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to sp@@ read that message . &quot; &quot; And I got in my s@@ ail@@ bo@@ at , s@@ ail@@ ed all the way through the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an — it wasn &apos;t really my s@@ ail@@ bo@@ at , I kind of worked on that bo@@ at — got to V@@ en@@ e@@ z@@ u@@ ela and I started wal@@ king ."
"This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ri@@ de in mot@@ or@@ iz@@ ed ve@@ hic@@ les ."
"I was wal@@ king through E@@ l D@@ or@@ a@@ do — it &apos;s a pris@@ on to@@ wn , fam@@ ous pris@@ on , or in@@ fam@@ ous pris@@ on — in V@@ en@@ e@@ z@@ u@@ ela , and I don ’ t know what pos@@ s@@ essed me , because this was not like me ."
"There I am , wal@@ king past the gu@@ ard g@@ ate and the gu@@ ard st@@ op@@ s and says , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ a@@ por@@ te , pas@@ a@@ por@@ te , &quot; &quot; and with an M@@ 16 poin@@ ted at me ."
"And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ ass@@ port , hu@@ h ?"
I don &apos;t need to show you my pass@@ port . It ’ s in the back of my p@@ ack .
I &apos;m D@@ r@@ . Fr@@ anc@@ is ; I &apos;m a U.@@ N@@ . Am@@ b@@ ass@@ ad@@ or and I &apos;m wal@@ king around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started wal@@ king off .
What pos@@ s@@ essed me to say this thing ?
The ro@@ ad turned into the j@@ un@@ gle .
I didn ’ t get sho@@ t .
"And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree at last — th@@ ank God Al@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?"
"It took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a pris@@ on@@ er ."
I was a pris@@ on@@ er and I needed to es@@ cap@@ e .
The pris@@ on that I was in was the fact that I did not dri@@ ve or use mot@@ or@@ iz@@ ed ve@@ hic@@ les .
Now how could that be ?
"Because when I started , it se@@ em@@ ed very appro@@ pri@@ ate to me not to use mot@@ or@@ iz@@ ed ve@@ hic@@ les ."
"But the thing that was different was that every bir@@ th@@ day , I asked myself about sil@@ ence , but I never asked myself about my dec@@ ision to just use my feet ."
I had no idea I was going to become a U.@@ N@@ . Am@@ b@@ ass@@ ad@@ or .
I had no idea I would have a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ .
"And so I realized that I had a respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change ."
"You know , we can do it ."
I was going to have to change .
"And I was af@@ rai@@ d to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just wal@@ ked ."
I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
But I know I needed to .
"I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today ."
"And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve g@@ ot@@ ten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go ."
"And we kind of have to leave behind the sec@@ ur@@ ity of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are be@@ coming ."
"And so , I want to encour@@ age you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any pris@@ on that you might find yourself in , as com@@ for@@ table as it may be , because we have to do something now ."
We have to change now .
"As our form@@ er V@@ ice P@@ res@@ id@@ ent said , we have to become acti@@ vis@@ ts ."
"So if my vo@@ ice can tou@@ ch you , if my actions can tou@@ ch you , if my being here can tou@@ ch you , pl@@ ease let it be ."
And I know that all of you have tou@@ ched me while I ’ ve been here .
"So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this car@@ ing , this love , this resp@@ ect that we ’ ve sh@@ own each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world ."
"Because we are the environment , and how we tre@@ at each other is really how we ’ re going to tre@@ at the environment ."
So I want to th@@ ank you for being here and I want to end this in five secon@@ ds of sil@@ ence .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the l@@ at@@ est ep@@ is@@ ode of India &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — long@@ est run@@ ning so@@ a@@ p op@@ era , which is cr@@ ick@@ et ."
"And may it run fore@@ ver , because it gi@@ ves people like me a living ."
"It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a normal so@@ a@@ p op@@ era to want : It &apos;s got love , jo@@ y , happ@@ iness , s@@ ad@@ ness , t@@ ear@@ s , l@@ aughter , lots of dec@@ e@@ it , in@@ tr@@ ig@@ ue ."
"And like all good so@@ ap@@ s , it j@@ um@@ ps 20 years when the audience inter@@ est changes ."
And that &apos;s exactly what cr@@ ick@@ et has done .
It &apos;s j@@ um@@ ped 20 years into 20@@ -@@ over game .
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change lea@@ ds to a very big re@@ volution ."
But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
C@@ r@@ ick@@ et wasn &apos;t always this spe@@ ed@@ -@@ dri@@ ven gener@@ ations game .
"There was a time when you play@@ ed cr@@ ick@@ et , you play@@ ed tim@@ el@@ ess test mat@@ ches , when you play@@ ed on till the game got over ."
And there was this game in Mar@@ ch 19@@ 3@@ 9 that started on the third of Mar@@ ch and ended on the 1@@ 4@@ th of Mar@@ ch .
"And it only ended because the Engl@@ ish cr@@ ick@@ et@@ ers had to go from D@@ urb@@ an to C@@ ape T@@ own , which is a tw@@ o-@@ h@@ our train jour@@ ney , to cat@@ ch the ship that left on the 1@@ 7@@ th , because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time ."
"So , the mat@@ ch was ended in between ."
"And one of the Engl@@ ish bat@@ sm@@ en said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
A@@ no@@ ther half an h@@ our and we would have won . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A@@ no@@ ther half an h@@ our after 12 days .
"There were two S@@ un@@ days in between . But of course , S@@ un@@ days are ch@@ ur@@ ch days , so you don &apos;t play on S@@ un@@ days . And one day it r@@ ained , so they all s@@ at around making friends with each other ."
But there is a reason why India f@@ ell in love with cr@@ ick@@ et : because we had about the same p@@ ace of life .
"( Laughter ) The M@@ a@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?"
"You f@@ ought by day , then it was su@@ n@@ set , so everyone went back home ."
"And then you worked out your strat@@ e@@ gy , and you came and f@@ ought the next day , and you went back home again ."
"The only difference between the M@@ a@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a and our cr@@ ick@@ et was that in cr@@ ick@@ et , everybody was ali@@ ve to come back and fi@@ ght the next day ."
"P@@ r@@ in@@ ces pa@@ tr@@ on@@ ize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of in@@ gr@@ ati@@ ating themselves to the B@@ ri@@ tis@@ h r@@ ul@@ ers ."
"But there is one other reason why India f@@ ell in love with cr@@ ick@@ et , which was , all you needed was a plan@@ k of w@@ ood and a ru@@ b@@ ber ball , and any number of people could play it any@@ where ."
"T@@ ake a look : You could play it in the d@@ um@@ p with some ro@@ c@@ ks over there , you could play it in a little al@@ ley — you couldn &apos;t h@@ it squ@@ are any@@ where , because the b@@ at h@@ it the w@@ all ; don &apos;t for@@ get the air condi@@ tion@@ ing and the c@@ able wi@@ res ."
( Laughter ) You could play it on the ban@@ ks of the G@@ ang@@ es — that &apos;s as cle@@ an as the G@@ ang@@ es has been for a long time .
"O@@ r you could play many gam@@ es in one small pat@@ ch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in ."
"( Laughter ) A@@ s you can see , you can play any@@ where ."
"But s@@ low@@ ly the game mo@@ ved on , you know , finally ."
"You don &apos;t always have five days . So , we mo@@ ved on , and we started pl@@ aying 5@@ 0@@ -@@ over cr@@ ick@@ et ."
And then an en@@ orm@@ ous ac@@ cident took place .
"In In@@ di@@ an s@@ port we don &apos;t make things happen , ac@@ cid@@ ents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes ."
And we won this World C@@ up in 19@@ 8@@ 3 .
"And sudd@@ en@@ ly we f@@ ell in love with the 5@@ 0@@ -@@ over game , and we play@@ ed it vir@@ tually every day ."
There was more 5@@ 0@@ -@@ over cr@@ ick@@ et than any@@ where .
But there was another big d@@ ate .
19@@ 8@@ 3 was when we won the World C@@ up .
"@@ 199@@ 1 , &apos; 9@@ 2 , we found a fin@@ ance min@@ ister and a pri@@ me min@@ ister w@@ ill@@ ing to let the world look at India , rather than be this great country of in@@ tr@@ ig@@ ue and my@@ st@@ ery in this clo@@ s@@ ed country ."
And so we al@@ lowed mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als into India .
"We cut cu@@ st@@ oms du@@ ties , we re@@ duc@@ ed im@@ port du@@ ties , and we got all the mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als coming in , with mul@@ tin@@ ational bu@@ d@@ gets , who looked at per@@ -@@ capit@@ a in@@ come and got very exc@@ ited about the possibil@@ ities in India , and were looking for a ve@@ hic@@ le to re@@ ach every In@@ di@@ an ."
"And there are only two ve@@ hic@@ les in India — one real , one s@@ cri@@ p@@ ted ."
"The s@@ cri@@ p@@ ted one is what you see in the mo@@ vies , the real one was cr@@ ick@@ et ."
"And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , R@@ av@@ i D@@ h@@ ari@@ w@@ al from P@@ ep@@ si , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world ."
"And P@@ ep@@ si was this big re@@ volution , because they started taking cr@@ ick@@ et all over ."
And so cr@@ ick@@ et started be@@ coming big ; cr@@ ick@@ et started br@@ ing@@ ing ri@@ ches in .
"T@@ el@@ ev@@ ision started co@@ ver@@ ing cr@@ ick@@ et . F@@ or a long time tel@@ ev@@ ision said , &quot; &quot; We won &apos;t co@@ ver cr@@ ick@@ et un@@ less you pay us to co@@ ver it . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en they said , &quot; &quot; OK , the next ri@@ ghts are sol@@ d for 5@@ 5 million dollars ."
"The next ri@@ ghts are sol@@ d for 6@@ 12 million dollars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a cur@@ ve , that ."
And then another big ac@@ cident happened in our cr@@ ick@@ et .
"En@@ gl@@ and invent@@ ed 20 o@@ vers cr@@ ick@@ et , and said , &quot; &quot; The world must play 20 o@@ vers cr@@ ick@@ et . &quot; &quot; J@@ ust as Engl@@ and invent@@ ed cr@@ ick@@ et , and made the rest of the world play it ."
Thank God for them .
"( Laughter ) And so , India had to go and play the T@@ 20 World C@@ up , you see ."
India didn &apos;t want to play the T@@ 20 World C@@ up .
But we were forc@@ ed to play it by an 8@@ -@@ 1 mar@@ g@@ in .
And then something very dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c happened .
"We got to the final , and then this moment , that will rem@@ ain en@@ sh@@ r@@ in@@ ed fore@@ ver , for everybody , take a look ."
( C@@ ro@@ w@@ d che@@ ering ) The P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an@@ i bat@@ sm@@ an trying to clear the fiel@@ der .
An@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ er : And Z@@ ish@@ an takes it ! India w@@ ins !
What a mat@@ ch for a T@@ w@@ ent@@ y@@ 20 final .
"In@@ dia , the world cham@@ pi@@ ons ."
"( Ch@@ e@@ ering ) India , T@@ 20 cham@@ pi@@ ons ."
"But what a game we had , M@@ . S. D@@ hon@@ i got it right in the air , but M@@ is@@ b@@ ah@@ -@@ ul@@ -@@ H@@ a@@ q , what a play@@ er ."
"A mas@@ sive , mas@@ sive succ@@ ess : India , the world T@@ T cham@@ pi@@ ons ."
H@@ ar@@ sh@@ a B@@ ho@@ gle : Su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly India disco@@ vered this power of 20@@ -@@ o@@ vers cr@@ ick@@ et .
"The ac@@ cident , of course , there , was that the bat@@ sm@@ an thought the bo@@ w@@ ler was bo@@ w@@ ling fast ."
"( Laughter ) If he had bo@@ w@@ led fast , the ball would have gone where it was me@@ ant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we sudd@@ en@@ ly disco@@ vered that we could be good at this game ."
And what it also did was it led to a certain pri@@ de in the fact that India could be the best in the world .
"It was at a time when inv@@ est@@ ment was coming in , India was feeling a little more confi@@ dent about itself ."
And so there was a feeling that there was great pri@@ de in what we can do .
"And th@@ an@@ k@@ fully for all of us , the Engl@@ ish are very good at invent@@ ing things , and then the gr@@ ac@@ ious people that they are , they let the world become very good at it ."
"( Laughter ) And so Engl@@ and invent@@ ed T@@ 20 cr@@ ick@@ et , and al@@ lowed India to hi@@ j@@ ack it ."
"It was not like re@@ engine@@ ering that we do in medic@@ ine , we just took it str@@ ai@@ ght away , as is ."
"( Laughter ) And so , we l@@ aun@@ ched our own T@@ 20 le@@ ag@@ ue ."
"S@@ ix weeks , city ver@@ sus city ."
"It was a new thing for us . We had only ever sup@@ por@@ ted our country — the only two areas in which India was very pr@@ oud about their country , repres@@ ent@@ ing itself on the field ."
"One was war , the In@@ di@@ an ar@@ my , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often ."
The other was In@@ di@@ an cr@@ ick@@ et .
"Now , sudd@@ en@@ ly we had to support city le@@ ag@@ ues ."
But the people getting into these city le@@ ag@@ ues were people who were taking their cu@@ es from the W@@ est .
"A@@ mer@@ ica is a home of le@@ ag@@ ues . And they said , &quot; Right , we &apos;ll build some g@@ lit@@ z@@ y le@@ ag@@ ues here in India . &quot;"
But was India ready for it ?
"Because cr@@ ick@@ et , for a long time in India was always organiz@@ ed ."
"It was never prom@@ ot@@ ed , it was never sol@@ d — it was organiz@@ ed ."
"And look what they did with our beautiful , ni@@ ce , simple family game ."
"A@@ ll of a sudd@@ en , you had that happening ."
( Music ) A@@ n op@@ en@@ ing cer@@ em@@ on@@ y to mat@@ ch every other .
This was an India that was bu@@ ying C@@ or@@ v@@ ettes . This was an India that was bu@@ ying J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar .
This was an India that was ad@@ ding more mo@@ bile phones per mon@@ th than New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and &apos;s population tw@@ ice over .
"So , it was a different India ."
"But it was also a sli@@ gh@@ tly more or@@ tho@@ do@@ x India that was very happy to be moder@@ n , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people ."
"And so , they were ag@@ h@@ ast when the che@@ er@@ leaders arri@@ ved ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ one sec@@ ret@@ ly wat@@ ched them , but everyone cl@@ aim@@ ed not to ."
( Music ) ( Laughter ) The new ow@@ n@@ ers of In@@ di@@ an cr@@ ick@@ et were not the old prin@@ ces .
They were not bure@@ au@@ cr@@ ats who were forc@@ ed into s@@ port because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who ran ser@@ ious companies .
"And so they started prom@@ ot@@ ing cr@@ ick@@ et big time , started prom@@ ot@@ ing c@@ lu@@ b@@ s big time ."
And they &apos;ve started prom@@ ot@@ ing them with huge money behind it .
"I mean the I@@ P@@ L had 2@@ .@@ 3 billion dollars before a ball was bo@@ w@@ led , 1@@ .@@ 6 billion dollars for tel@@ ev@@ ision reven@@ ue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars plus from all these fran@@ ch@@ is@@ es that were pu@@ tting in money . And then they had to appe@@ al to their cities , but they had to do it like the W@@ est , right ? Because we are s@@ etting up le@@ ag@@ ues ."
But what they were very good at doing was making it very loc@@ aliz@@ ed .
"So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not M@@ an@@ ch@@ es@@ ter United st@@ y@@ le prom@@ o@@ tion , but very M@@ um@@ b@@ ai st@@ y@@ le prom@@ o@@ tion . T@@ ake a look ."
"( Music ) O@@ f course , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ay@@ be they d@@ ance better than they play . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cr@@ ick@@ et ."
"A@@ ll along , if you wanted a young cr@@ ick@@ eter , you pic@@ ked him up from the b@@ y@@ l@@ an@@ es of your own little loc@@ ality , your own city , and you were very pr@@ oud of the system that produc@@ ed those cr@@ ick@@ et@@ ers ."
"Now , all of the sudd@@ en , if you were to bo@@ w@@ l a sho@@ t — if M@@ um@@ b@@ ai were to bo@@ w@@ l a sho@@ t , for example , they nee@@ dn &apos;t go to K@@ al@@ b@@ ad@@ ev@@ i or S@@ hi@@ v@@ a@@ j@@ i Par@@ k or some@@ where to source them , they could go to Tr@@ in@@ id@@ ad ."
"This was the new India , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can source from any@@ where as long as you get the best produc@@ t at the best pr@@ ice ."
"And all of a sudd@@ en , In@@ di@@ an s@@ port had aw@@ ak@@ en@@ ed to the reality that you can source the best produc@@ t for the best pr@@ ice any@@ where in the world ."
"So , the M@@ um@@ b@@ ai In@@ di@@ ans f@@ le@@ w in D@@ w@@ ay@@ ne Br@@ av@@ o from Tr@@ in@@ id@@ ad and T@@ ob@@ ago , over@@ night . And when he had to go back to repres@@ ent the W@@ est In@@ dies , they asked him , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en do you have to re@@ ach ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I have to be there by a certain time , so I have to leave today . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . It &apos;s not about when you have to leave ; it &apos;s about when do you have to re@@ ach there ? &quot; &quot; And so he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to re@@ ach on d@@ ate X@@ . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine , you play to d@@ ate X , min@@ us one . &quot; &quot; So , he play@@ ed in H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , went , str@@ ai@@ ght after the game ,"
"@@ went from the st@@ adi@@ um to H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad air@@ port , s@@ at in a priv@@ ate cor@@ por@@ ate j@@ et — first re@@ fu@@ eling in P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al , second re@@ fu@@ eling in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il ; he was in W@@ est In@@ dies in time ."
( Laughter ) N@@ ever would India have thought on this scale before .
"N@@ ever would India have said , &quot; &quot; I want a play@@ er to play one game for me , and I will use a cor@@ por@@ ate j@@ et to s@@ end him all the way back to K@@ ing@@ st@@ on , J@@ am@@ ai@@ c@@ a to play a game . &quot; &quot; And I just thought to myself , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , we &apos;ve arri@@ ved some@@ where in the world , you know ?"
"We have arri@@ ved some@@ where . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started mar@@ r@@ ying the two most important things in In@@ di@@ an cr@@ ick@@ et , which is cr@@ ick@@ et and the mo@@ vies in In@@ di@@ an ent@@ ert@@ ain@@ ment ."
There is cr@@ ick@@ et and the mo@@ vies .
And they came together because people in the mo@@ vies now started ow@@ ning c@@ lu@@ b@@ s .
"And so , people started going to the cr@@ ick@@ et to watch P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a ."
They started going to the cr@@ ick@@ et to watch Sh@@ ah R@@ u@@ k@@ h K@@ h@@ an .
And something very interesting happened .
We started getting s@@ ong and d@@ ance in In@@ di@@ an cr@@ ick@@ et .
And so it started res@@ embl@@ ing the In@@ di@@ an mo@@ vies more and more .
"And of course , if you were on P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a &apos;s team — as you will see on the cli@@ p that fol@@ lo@@ ws — if you did well , you got a hu@@ g from P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a ."
So that was the ul@@ tim@@ ate reason to do well . T@@ ake a look — everyone &apos;s wat@@ ching P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a .
( Music ) And then of course there was Sh@@ ah R@@ u@@ k@@ h pl@@ aying the K@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a cro@@ w@@ d .
"We &apos;d all seen mat@@ ches in K@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : Sh@@ ah R@@ u@@ k@@ h , with the B@@ eng@@ al@@ i s@@ ong , getting the audi@@ ences all worked up for K@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a — not for India , but for K@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a ."
But take a look at this .
( Music ) A@@ n In@@ di@@ an film st@@ ar hu@@ gg@@ ing a P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an@@ i cr@@ ick@@ eter because they &apos;d won in K@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a .
C@@ an you imagine ?
And do you know what the P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an@@ i cr@@ ick@@ eter said ?
( Applause ) &quot; I w@@ ish I was pl@@ aying for P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a &apos;s team . &quot;
( Laughter ) But I thought I &apos;d take this opportunity — there &apos;s a few people from P@@ ak@@ istan in here .
"I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?"
"We can play cr@@ ick@@ et together , we can be friends ."
"So th@@ ank you very much for coming , all of you from P@@ ak@@ istan ."
"( Applause ) There was cri@@ tic@@ ism too because they said , &quot; &quot; P@@ l@@ ay@@ ers are being bou@@ ght and sol@@ d ?"
A@@ re they gr@@ ain ?
"A@@ re they cat@@ tle ? &quot; &quot; Because we had this auc@@ tion , you see ."
How do you fi@@ x a pr@@ ice for a play@@ er ?
"And so the auc@@ tion that fol@@ lowed literally had people saying , &quot; B@@ an@@ g ! so many million dollars for so@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ so play@@ er . &quot;"
There it is .
"( Music ) A@@ uc@@ tion@@ e@@ er : G@@ o@@ ing at 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars . Ch@@ enn@@ ai ."
"S@@ h@@ ane W@@ ar@@ ne sol@@ d for 4@@ 5@@ 0,000 dollars ."
"H@@ B : Su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , a game which ear@@ ned its play@@ ers 50 ru@@ pe@@ es a day — so 2@@ 50 ru@@ pe@@ es for a test mat@@ ch , but if you fin@@ ish in four days you only got 200 ."
"The best In@@ di@@ an play@@ ers who play@@ ed every test mat@@ ch — every one of the intern@@ ation@@ als , the top of the line play@@ ers — stand@@ ard contr@@ ac@@ ts are 2@@ 20@@ ,000 dollars in a whole year ."
"Now they were getting 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 for six days &apos; work ."
"Th@@ en An@@ dre@@ w F@@ lin@@ to@@ ff came by from Engl@@ and , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or four weeks , I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than Fr@@ ank L@@ am@@ par@@ d and St@@ even G@@ er@@ r@@ ard , and I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than the fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all@@ ers , w@@ ow . &quot; &quot; And where was he ear@@ ning it from ? F@@ ro@@ m a little c@@ lu@@ b in India ."
C@@ ould you have imagin@@ ed that day would come ?
One and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
"That &apos;s not bad , is it ?"
"So , at 2@@ .@@ 3 billion dollars before the first ball was bo@@ w@@ led ."
"What India was doing , though , was ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge br@@ and ."
L@@ al@@ it Mo@@ d@@ i was on the co@@ ver of B@@ us@@ iness T@@ o@@ day .
"I@@ P@@ L became the bigg@@ est br@@ and in India and , because our el@@ ec@@ tions , had to be mo@@ ved to Sou@@ th Africa , and we had to start the tour@@ nam@@ ent in three weeks ."
Mo@@ ve a whole tour@@ nam@@ ent to Sou@@ th Africa in three weeks .
But we did it . You know why ?
"Because no country works as s@@ low@@ ly as we do till three weeks before an ev@@ ent , and no@@ body works fast as we do in the last three weeks ."
"( Applause ) O@@ ur population , which for a long time we thought was a problem , sudd@@ en@@ ly became our bigg@@ est ass@@ et because there were more people wat@@ ching — the huge con@@ sum@@ ing clas@@ s — everybody came to watch the cr@@ ick@@ et ."
"We &apos;d also made cr@@ ick@@ et the only s@@ port in India , which is a p@@ ity , but in India every other s@@ port p@@ us@@ h@@ es cr@@ ick@@ et to become big , which is a bit of a tr@@ age@@ dy of our times ."
"Now , this last minute before I go — there &apos;s a couple of side eff@@ ects of all this ."
"For a long time , India was this country of po@@ ver@@ ty , d@@ ust , beg@@ gar@@ s , s@@ n@@ ake char@@ m@@ ers , fil@@ th , D@@ el@@ h@@ i bel@@ ly — people heard D@@ el@@ h@@ i bel@@ ly stories before they came ."
"And , all of a sudd@@ en , India was this land of opportunity ."
"C@@ r@@ ick@@ et@@ ers all over the world said , &quot; You know , we love India . We love to play in India . &quot;"
"And that felt good , you know ?"
"We said , &quot; &quot; The doll@@ ar &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot; &quot; C@@ an you imagine , you &apos;ve got the doll@@ ar on view and there &apos;s no D@@ el@@ h@@ i bel@@ ly in there any@@ more ."
"There &apos;s no fil@@ th , there &apos;s no beg@@ gar@@ s , all the s@@ n@@ ake char@@ m@@ ers have v@@ an@@ ished , everybody &apos;s gone . This tel@@ ls you how the capit@@ alis@@ t world ru@@ les ."
"@@ Right so , finally , an Engl@@ ish game that India u@@ sur@@ ped a little bit , but T@@ 20 is going to be the next mis@@ si@@ on@@ ary in the world ."
"If you want to take the game around the world , it &apos;s got to be the sh@@ or@@ test form of the game ."
"You can &apos;t take a tim@@ el@@ ess test to China and s@@ it through 14 days with no resul@@ t in the end , or you can &apos;t take it all over the world ."
So that &apos;s what T@@ 20 is doing .
"H@@ op@@ e@@ fully , it &apos;ll make everyone ri@@ cher , hop@@ e@@ fully it &apos;ll make the game bigg@@ er and hop@@ e@@ fully it &apos;ll give cr@@ ick@@ et comm@@ ent@@ at@@ ors more time in the business ."

"So , imagine you &apos;re st@@ anding on a stre@@ et any@@ where in America and a J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Ex@@ cu@@ se me , what is the name of this bloc@@ k ? &quot;"

"S@@ tre@@ ets have nam@@ es ; bloc@@ ks are just the un@@ nam@@ ed sp@@ aces in between stre@@ ets . &quot; &quot; He le@@ aves , a little conf@@ used and dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted ."
"So , now imagine you &apos;re st@@ anding on a stre@@ et , any@@ where in J@@ ap@@ an , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Ex@@ cu@@ se me , what is the name of this stre@@ et ? &quot;"
"They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s B@@ loc@@ k 1@@ 7 and this is B@@ loc@@ k 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this stre@@ et ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , stre@@ ets don &apos;t have nam@@ es ."
B@@ loc@@ ks have nam@@ es .

The first house ever built on a bloc@@ k is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
"Th@@ ird is house number three . It &apos;s easy .

"So , for example , there are doc@@ tors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you heal@@ thy ."
"So , any mon@@ th you are heal@@ thy you pay them , and when you &apos;re s@@ ick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they fai@@ led at their job . They get r@@ ich when you &apos;re heal@@ thy , not s@@ ick ."
"( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the do@@ w@@ n@@ be@@ at , the beginning of the mus@@ ical ph@@ ra@@ se : one , two , three , four ."
"But in W@@ est Afr@@ ican music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the ph@@ ra@@ se , like the per@@ i@@ od at the end of a sent@@ ence ."
"So , you can hear it not just in the ph@@ r@@ as@@ ing , but the way they coun@@ t off their music : two , three , four , one ."
And this ma@@ p is also acc@@ ur@@ ate .
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the op@@ pos@@ ite is also true ."

D@@ om@@ o ar@@ ig@@ a@@ to go@@ z@@ ai@@ mas@@ h@@ it@@ a .
Wh@@ o b@@ omb@@ ed your house ?
Wh@@ o kill@@ ed your son ?
D@@ id the rest of your family make it out ali@@ ve ?
How are you cop@@ ing in your life in ex@@ ile ?
"What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the b@@ omb@@ s were explo@@ ding in your to@@ wn , and the arm@@ ed g@@ ang@@ s were appro@@ ach@@ ing your house ?"
A S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e bo@@ y I know told me that he didn &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate when his life was in im@@ min@@ ent d@@ anger .
"He took his high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a , and later he told me why ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I took my high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a because my life depend@@ ed on it . &quot; &quot; And he would risk his life to get that di@@ pl@@ om@@ a ."
"On his way to school , he would do@@ dge s@@ ni@@ per@@ s ."
"H@@ is cl@@ ass@@ room sometimes sho@@ ok with the sound of b@@ omb@@ s and sh@@ elling , and his mother told me , &quot; &quot; E@@ very day , I would say to him every morning , &apos; H@@ on@@ ey , pl@@ ease don &apos;t go to school . &apos; &quot; &quot; And when he ins@@ is@@ ted , she said , &quot; I would hu@@ g him as if it were for the last time . &quot;"
"But he said to his mother , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re all af@@ rai@@ d , but our det@@ er@@ min@@ ation to grad@@ u@@ ate is str@@ ong@@ er than our fear . &quot; &quot; But one day , the family got terri@@ ble news ."
It was time to f@@ le@@ e .
"And they would cro@@ ss the bor@@ der into Le@@ ban@@ on , where they would find p@@ ea@@ ce ."
But they would beg@@ in a life of gr@@ u@@ eling har@@ d@@ ship and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y .
"And that day , they jo@@ in@@ ed the bigg@@ est population of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es in the world , in a country , Le@@ ban@@ on , that is tiny ."
"It only has four million ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , and there are one million S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es living there ."
"There &apos;s not a to@@ wn , a city or a village that is not ho@@ st to S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
This is gener@@ os@@ ity and human@@ ity that is re@@ mark@@ able .
"Th@@ ink about it this way , pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately ."
"It would be as if the entire population of G@@ er@@ many , 80 million people , would f@@ le@@ e to the United States in just three years ."
"O@@ ver and well over three million people have cro@@ ss@@ ed the bor@@ ders and have found s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary in the neigh@@ bor@@ ing countries , and only a small pro@@ por@@ tion , as you see , have mo@@ ved on to Europe ."
What I find most wor@@ r@@ ying is that half of all S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es are children .
I took this picture of this little girl .
It was just two hours after she had arri@@ ved after a long tre@@ k from S@@ y@@ ri@@ a into J@@ or@@ d@@ an .
And most trou@@ bl@@ ing of all is that only 20 percent of S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children are in school in Le@@ ban@@ on .
"And yet , S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children , all re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives ."
Why ? Because it allo@@ ws them to think of their future rather than the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ ma@@ re of their past .
It allo@@ ws them to think of hope rather than h@@ at@@ red .
"I think she couldn &apos;t , because I think she must realiz@@ e that she repres@@ ents a lost gener@@ ation of S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children , a gener@@ ation is@@ ol@@ ated and fr@@ ustr@@ ated ."
"And yet , look at what they fl@@ ed : u@@ t@@ ter des@@ truc@@ tion , buil@@ dings , indus@@ tries , scho@@ ols , ro@@ a@@ ds , hom@@ es ."
H@@ any &apos;s home was also des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed .
"This will need to be re@@ built by archit@@ ects , by engine@@ ers , by electr@@ ici@@ ans ."
Com@@ m@@ uni@@ ties will need tea@@ chers and la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans interested in re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation and not reven@@ ge .
Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es have a lot of time to pre@@ p@@ are for their re@@ turn .
You might imagine that being a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e is just a tem@@ por@@ ary state .
Well far from it .
"W@@ ith w@@ ars going on and on , the average time a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e will spend in ex@@ ile is 1@@ 7 years ."
"H@@ any was into his second year in lim@@ b@@ o when I went to vis@@ it him rec@@ ently , and we con@@ duc@@ ted our entire conversation in Engl@@ ish , which he conf@@ essed to me he learned from read@@ ing all of D@@ an B@@ ro@@ wn &apos;s nov@@ els and from lis@@ ten@@ ing to American ra@@ p ."
We also spent some ni@@ ce moments of l@@ aughter and f@@ un with his bel@@ o@@ ved bro@@ ther A@@ sh@@ ra@@ f .
"He said to me , &quot; If I am not a stu@@ dent , I am nothing . &quot;"
H@@ any is one of 50 million people u@@ pro@@ ot@@ ed in this world today .
N@@ ever since World W@@ ar I@@ I have so many people been for@@ ci@@ bly dis@@ plac@@ ed .
"So while we &apos;re making s@@ wee@@ ping progr@@ ess in human health , in technology , in education and design , we are doing danger@@ ously little to help the vic@@ ti@@ ms and we are doing far too little to stop and pre@@ vent the w@@ ars that are dri@@ ving them from their hom@@ es ."
And there are more and more vic@@ ti@@ ms .
"E@@ very day , on average , by the end of this day , 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people will be for@@ ci@@ bly dis@@ plac@@ ed from their hom@@ es — 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people ."
They f@@ le@@ e across bor@@ ders like this one .
"We cap@@ tu@@ red this on the S@@ y@@ ri@@ an bor@@ der to J@@ or@@ d@@ an , and this is a ty@@ p@@ ical day ."
"O@@ r they f@@ le@@ e on un@@ s@@ ea@@ wor@@ thy and over@@ cro@@ w@@ ded bo@@ ats , ris@@ king their lives in this case just to re@@ ach s@@ af@@ ety in Europe ."
"H@@ ow about a place of heal@@ ing , of learning , and even opportunity ?"
"A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans and Euro@@ pe@@ ans have the impression that pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ally huge numbers of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es are coming to their country , but the reality is that 8@@ 6 percent , the v@@ ast major@@ ity of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , are living in the develop@@ ing world , in countries stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with their own insec@@ ur@@ ity , with their own issu@@ es of hel@@ ping their own popul@@ ations and po@@ ver@@ ty ."
So we@@ al@@ thy countries in the world should recogni@@ ze the human@@ ity and the gener@@ os@@ ity of the countries that are ho@@ st@@ ing so many re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
And all countries should make sure that no one f@@ le@@ e@@ ing war and pers@@ ec@@ ution arri@@ ves at a clo@@ s@@ ed bor@@ der .
( Applause ) Thank you .
We can help them th@@ ri@@ ve .
We should think of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps and communi@@ ties as more than just tem@@ por@@ ary population cent@@ ers where people langu@@ ish w@@ ai@@ ting for the war to end .
"R@@ a@@ ther , as cent@@ ers of ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ence , where re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es can tri@@ um@@ p@@ h over their tr@@ au@@ ma and train for the day that they can go home as ag@@ ents of positive change and social transform@@ ation ."
"It makes so much sense , but I &apos;m re@@ min@@ ded of the terri@@ ble war in S@@ om@@ ali@@ a that has been r@@ ag@@ ing on for 2@@ 2 years ."
And imagine living in this cam@@ p .
I vis@@ ited this cam@@ p .
"And I also thought , what a was@@ te ."
She should be and she is the future of S@@ om@@ ali@@ a .
"A bo@@ y nam@@ ed J@@ ac@@ o@@ b A@@ te@@ m had a different chance , but not before he experi@@ enc@@ ed terri@@ bly tr@@ age@@ dy ."
"He wat@@ ched — this is in Su@@ d@@ an — as his village — he was only seven years old — bur@@ ned to the ground , and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family were kill@@ ed that day ."
"But his life changed when he got the chance to be res@@ et@@ t@@ led to the United States , and he found love in a fo@@ st@@ er family and he was able to go to school , and he wanted me to share with you this pr@@ oud moment when he grad@@ u@@ ated from univers@@ ity ."
"( Applause ) I spo@@ ke to him on S@@ k@@ y@@ pe the other day , and he was in his new univers@@ ity in F@@ l@@ or@@ id@@ a pur@@ su@@ ing his Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . in public health , and he pr@@ ou@@ d@@ ly told me how he was able to rai@@ se enough fun@@ ds from the American public to est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish a health clin@@ ic back in his village back home ."
So I want to take you back to H@@ any .
"He wr@@ ote : &quot; &quot; I mis@@ s myself , my friends , times of read@@ ing nov@@ els or wr@@ iting po@@ ems , bir@@ ds and te@@ a in the morning ."
"My room , my books , myself , and everything that was making me s@@ mi@@ le ."
"O@@ h , oh , I had so many dre@@ ams that were about to be realized . &quot; &quot; So here is my point : N@@ ot inv@@ es@@ ting in re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es is a huge m@@ iss@@ ed opportunity ."
"L@@ e@@ ave them ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed , and they risk explo@@ itation and ab@@ use , and leave them un@@ sk@@ ill@@ ed and un@@ e@@ duc@@ ated , and del@@ ay by years the re@@ turn to p@@ ea@@ ce and pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity in their countries ."
I believe how we tre@@ at the u@@ pro@@ ot@@ ed will sh@@ ape the future of our world .
"The vic@@ ti@@ ms of war can hold the ke@@ ys to l@@ as@@ ting p@@ ea@@ ce , and it &apos;s the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es who can stop the cy@@ cle of violence ."
H@@ any is at a ti@@ p@@ ping point .
"We would love to help him go to univers@@ ity and to become an engine@@ er , but our fun@@ ds are pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed for the bas@@ ics in life : t@@ ents and blan@@ k@@ ets and mat@@ tr@@ esses and k@@ it@@ ch@@ en se@@ ts , food r@@ ations and a bit of medic@@ ine ."
Uni@@ versity is a lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y .
"But leave him to langu@@ ish in this mu@@ d@@ dy field , and he will become a mem@@ ber of a lost gener@@ ation ."
"H@@ any &apos;s story is a tr@@ age@@ dy , but it doesn &apos;t have to end that way ."
Thank you .

"B@@ eli@@ eve me or not , I come off@@ ering a solution to a very important part of this larg@@ er problem , with the re@@ qu@@ is@@ ite foc@@ us on clim@@ ate ."
"And the solution I off@@ er is to the bigg@@ est cul@@ pr@@ it in this mas@@ sive m@@ ist@@ re@@ at@@ ment of the ear@@ th by human@@ kind , and the resul@@ ting dec@@ line of the bio@@ sp@@ here ."
"That cul@@ pr@@ it is business and indus@@ try , which happens to be where I have spent the last 5@@ 2 years since my grad@@ u@@ ation from Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a T@@ ech in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"As an industri@@ al engine@@ er , cu@@ m as@@ pir@@ ing and then succ@@ ess@@ ful entrepren@@ eur ."
"A@@ f@@ ter f@@ oun@@ ding my company , In@@ ter@@ face , from s@@ cr@@ at@@ ch in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , 3@@ 6 years ago , to produce car@@ p@@ et ti@@ les in America for the business and institu@@ tion mark@@ ets , and sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ ding it through star@@ t-@@ up and sur@@ viv@@ al to pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity and global dom@@ in@@ ance in its field , I read P@@ au@@ l H@@ aw@@ ken &apos;s book , &quot; The E@@ colo@@ gy of Com@@ mer@@ ce , &quot; the sum@@ mer of 199@@ 4 ."
"In his book , P@@ au@@ l ch@@ arg@@ es business and indus@@ try as , one , the maj@@ or cul@@ pr@@ it in caus@@ ing the dec@@ line of the bio@@ sp@@ here , and , two , the only institu@@ tion that is large enough , and per@@ vas@@ ive enough , and powerful enough , to really l@@ ead human@@ kind out of this m@@ ess ."
And by the way he conv@@ ic@@ ted me as a pl@@ under@@ er of the ear@@ th .
"And I then chall@@ eng@@ ed the people of In@@ ter@@ face , my company , to l@@ ead our company and the entire industri@@ al world to sust@@ ain@@ ability , which we defin@@ ed as even@@ tually oper@@ ating our pe@@ tr@@ ol@@ eu@@ m@@ -@@ inten@@ sive company in such a way as to take from the ear@@ th only what can be ren@@ e@@ wed by the ear@@ th , nat@@ ur@@ ally and rapid@@ ly — not another f@@ res@@ h dro@@ p of oil — and to do no har@@ m to the bio@@ sp@@ here ."
T@@ ake nothing : do no har@@ m .
"I simply said , &quot; &quot; If H@@ aw@@ ken is right and business and indus@@ try must l@@ ead , who will l@@ ead business and indus@@ try ?"
"@@ Un@@ less somebody lea@@ ds , no@@ body will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ax@@ i@@ om@@ ati@@ c . Why not us ?"
"And th@@ an@@ ks to the people of In@@ ter@@ face , I have become a re@@ co@@ ver@@ ing pl@@ under@@ er ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a F@@ or@@ t@@ une M@@ ag@@ az@@ ine wr@@ iter that some@@ day people like me would go to j@@ ail .
And that became the hea@@ d@@ line of a F@@ or@@ t@@ une artic@@ le .
They went on to descri@@ be me as America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O .
"F@@ ro@@ m pl@@ under@@ er to re@@ co@@ ver@@ ing pl@@ under@@ er , to America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O in five years — that , fran@@ k@@ ly , was a pretty s@@ ad comm@@ ent@@ ary on American C@@ E@@ O@@ s in 199@@ 9 ."
"A@@ s@@ ked later in the C@@ an@@ adi@@ an doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary , &quot; &quot; The C@@ or@@ por@@ ation , &quot; &quot; what I me@@ ant by the &quot; &quot; go to j@@ ail &quot; &quot; remar@@ k , I off@@ ered that the@@ ft is a cri@@ me ."
And the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future would some@@ day be a cri@@ me .
"But I realized , for that to be true — for the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future to be a cri@@ me — there must be a clear , dem@@ on@@ str@@ able al@@ tern@@ ative to the ta@@ ke@@ -@@ ma@@ ke@@ -@@ was@@ te industri@@ al system that so dom@@ in@@ ates our civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation , and is the maj@@ or cul@@ pr@@ it , ste@@ al@@ ing our children &apos;s future , by di@@ gg@@ ing up the ear@@ th and con@@ ver@@ ting it to produc@@ ts that quickly become was@@ te in a land@@ f@@ ill or an inc@@ in@@ er@@ ator — in sh@@ ort , di@@ gg@@ ing up the ear@@ th and con@@ ver@@ ting it to pol@@ lu@@ tion ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch and a w@@ ell@@ -@@ known environ@@ mental impact equ@@ ation , impact — a bad thing — is the produc@@ t of population , aff@@ lu@@ ence and technology ."
"That is , impact is gener@@ ated by people , what they con@@ su@@ me in their aff@@ lu@@ ence , and how it is produc@@ ed ."
"And though the equ@@ ation is larg@@ ely subj@@ ec@@ tive , you can perhaps quanti@@ f@@ y people , and perhaps quanti@@ f@@ y aff@@ lu@@ ence , but technology is ab@@ u@@ sive in too many ways to quanti@@ f@@ y ."
So the equ@@ ation is concep@@ tu@@ al .
S@@ till it works to help us understand the problem .
"So we set out at In@@ ter@@ face , in 199@@ 4 , to create an example : to trans@@ form the way we made car@@ p@@ et , a pe@@ tr@@ ol@@ eu@@ m@@ -@@ inten@@ sive produc@@ t for mater@@ i@@ als as well as energy , and to trans@@ form our technologies so they di@@ min@@ ished environ@@ mental impact , rather than multi@@ pl@@ i@@ ed it ."
"P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch &apos;s environ@@ mental impact equ@@ ation : I is equ@@ al to P times A times T : population , aff@@ lu@@ ence and technology ."
I wanted In@@ ter@@ face to re@@ wr@@ ite that equ@@ ation so that it read I equ@@ als P times A di@@ vi@@ ded by T@@ .
"Now , the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ call@@ y-@@ min@@ ded will see im@@ medi@@ ately that T in the num@@ er@@ ator increas@@ es impact — a bad thing — but T in the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator dec@@ reas@@ es impact ."
"So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the num@@ er@@ ator — call it T@@ 1 — where it increas@@ es impact , to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator — call it T@@ 2 — where it re@@ du@@ ces impact ?"
"I thought about the char@@ acter@@ is@@ tics of first industri@@ al re@@ volution , T@@ 1 , as we pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed it at In@@ ter@@ face , and it had the fol@@ lo@@ wing char@@ acter@@ is@@ tics ."
Ex@@ tr@@ active : taking ra@@ w mater@@ i@@ als from the ear@@ th .
"L@@ in@@ ear : take , make , was@@ te ."
P@@ o@@ wer@@ ed by fo@@ ssi@@ l fu@@ el@@ -@@ der@@ iv@@ ed energy .
W@@ as@@ te@@ ful : ab@@ u@@ sive and foc@@ used on lab@@ or produc@@ tiv@@ ity .
Mo@@ re car@@ p@@ et per man@@ -@@ h@@ our .
"Th@@ in@@ king it through , I realized that all those at@@ tribu@@ tes must be changed to move T to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator ."
"In the new industri@@ al re@@ volution extr@@ active must be re@@ plac@@ ed by ren@@ e@@ w@@ able ; lin@@ ear by cy@@ cli@@ c@@ al ; fo@@ ssi@@ l fu@@ el energy by ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy , su@@ n@@ light ; was@@ te@@ ful by was@@ te@@ -@@ free ; and ab@@ u@@ sive by ben@@ ign ; and lab@@ or produc@@ tiv@@ ity by res@@ our@@ ce produc@@ tiv@@ ity ."
"And I reas@@ on@@ ed that if we could make those transform@@ ative changes , and get ri@@ d of T@@ 1 al@@ together , we could re@@ du@@ ce our impact to z@@ er@@ o , inclu@@ ding our impact on the clim@@ ate ."
"And that became the In@@ ter@@ face plan in 199@@ 5 , and has been the plan ever since ."
We have mea@@ su@@ red our progr@@ ess very ri@@ g@@ or@@ ously .
So I can tell you how far we have come in the en@@ su@@ ing 12 years .
N@@ et gre@@ en@@ house g@@ as em@@ is@@ sions down 8@@ 2 percent in absolu@@ te t@@ onn@@ age .
( Applause ) O@@ ver the same sp@@ an of time s@@ ales have increas@@ ed by tw@@ o-@@ th@@ ir@@ ds and prof@@ its have dou@@ bl@@ ed .
So an 8@@ 2 percent absolu@@ te re@@ duc@@ tion trans@@ l@@ ates into a 90 percent re@@ duc@@ tion in gre@@ en@@ house g@@ as inten@@ s@@ ity rel@@ ative to s@@ ales .
This is the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of the re@@ duc@@ tion the entire global tech@@ no@@ sp@@ here must realiz@@ e by 20@@ 50 to av@@ o@@ id cat@@ astr@@ op@@ hi@@ c clim@@ ate dis@@ ru@@ ption — so the scientists are telling us .
"F@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ el us@@ age is down 60 percent per un@@ it of production , du@@ e to eff@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es in ren@@ e@@ w@@ ables ."
"The che@@ ap@@ est , most sec@@ ure bar@@ re@@ l of oil there is is the one not used through eff@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
W@@ ater us@@ age is down 7@@ 5 percent in our wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de car@@ p@@ et ti@@ le business .
"D@@ own 40 percent in our bro@@ ad@@ loo@@ m car@@ p@@ et business , which we ac@@ qui@@ red in 199@@ 3 right here in Califor@@ ni@@ a , C@@ ity of In@@ d@@ us@@ try , where water is so pre@@ ci@@ ous ."
"R@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able or rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able mater@@ i@@ als are 25 percent of the tot@@ al , and growing rapid@@ ly ."
"R@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy is 2@@ 7 percent of our tot@@ al , going for 100 percent ."

"Th@@ ree years ago we l@@ aun@@ ched car@@ p@@ et ti@@ le for the home , under the br@@ and F@@ lo@@ r , mis@@ sp@@ ell@@ ed F@@ -@@ L@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ R ."
You can point and cli@@ ck today at F@@ l@@ or@@ .@@ co@@ m and have Co@@ ol Car@@ p@@ et deli@@ vered to your front do@@ or in five days .
"It is pr@@ ac@@ tical , and pretty too ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We rec@@ k@@ on that we are a bit over hal@@ f@@ way to our go@@ al : z@@ er@@ o impact , z@@ er@@ o fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t ."
"We &apos;ve set 20@@ 20 as our tar@@ get year for z@@ er@@ o , for re@@ ach@@ ing the top , the sum@@ m@@ it of M@@ oun@@ t Su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability ."
We call this M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o .
And this is perhaps the most important fac@@ et : we have found M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o to be incredi@@ bly good for business .
"A better business model , a better way to bigg@@ er prof@@ its ."
Here is the business case for sust@@ ain@@ ability .
"F@@ ro@@ m real life experience , co@@ sts are down , not up , re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ting some 4@@ 00 million dollars of av@@ o@@ ided co@@ sts in pur@@ su@@ it of z@@ er@@ o was@@ te — the first face of M@@ oun@@ t Su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability ."
This has p@@ aid all the co@@ sts for the transform@@ ation of In@@ ter@@ face .
"And this dis@@ p@@ els a my@@ th too , this f@@ al@@ se cho@@ ice between the environment and the economy ."
"O@@ ur produc@@ ts are the best they &apos;ve ever been , insp@@ i@@ red by design for sust@@ ain@@ ability , an un@@ exp@@ ected w@@ ell@@ s@@ pr@@ ing of innovation ."
O@@ ur people are gal@@ v@@ an@@ iz@@ ed around this shar@@ ed high@@ er pur@@ pose .
You cannot be@@ at it for attr@@ ac@@ ting the best people and br@@ ing@@ ing them together .
And the go@@ od@@ will of the mark@@ et@@ place is as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing .
"N@@ o amount of ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ing , no cl@@ ever mark@@ eting cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n , at any pr@@ ice , could have produc@@ ed or created this much go@@ od@@ will ."
"C@@ os@@ ts , produc@@ ts , people , mark@@ et@@ places — what else is there ?"
It is a better business model .
And here is our 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year re@@ cord of s@@ ales and prof@@ its .
"There is a di@@ p there , from 200@@ 1 to 200@@ 3 : a di@@ p when our s@@ ales , over a thre@@ e-@@ year per@@ i@@ od , were down 1@@ 7 percent ."
But the mark@@ et@@ place was down 3@@ 6 percent .
We literally g@@ ained market share .
We might not have sur@@ viv@@ ed that rec@@ ession but for the adv@@ ant@@ ages of sust@@ ain@@ ability .
"If every business were pur@@ su@@ ing In@@ ter@@ face pl@@ ans , would that sol@@ ve all our problems ?"
I don &apos;t think so .
"I rem@@ ain trou@@ bl@@ ed by the re@@ vis@@ ed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch equ@@ ation , I equ@@ als P times A di@@ vi@@ ded by T@@ 2 ."
"That A is a cap@@ ital A , sugg@@ es@@ ting that aff@@ lu@@ ence is an end in itself ."
But what if we re@@ fr@@ am@@ ed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch fur@@ ther ?
"And what if we made A a lo@@ wer@@ case &apos; a , &apos; sugg@@ es@@ ting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happ@@ iness — more happ@@ iness with less stuff ."
"You know that would re@@ fr@@ ame civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of econom@@ ics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ds us : the sust@@ ain@@ able species , living on a fin@@ ite ear@@ th , e@@ th@@ ically , happ@@ ily and ec@@ olo@@ g@@ ically in bal@@ ance with nature and all her natural systems for a thou@@ sand gener@@ ations , or 1@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations — that is to say , into the in@@ defin@@ ite future ."
But does the ear@@ th have to w@@ ait for our ext@@ inc@@ tion as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
"A@@ t In@@ ter@@ face we really inten@@ d to bring this prot@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ ical sust@@ ain@@ able , z@@ er@@ o-@@ fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t industri@@ al company fully into exist@@ ence by 20@@ 20 ."
"We can see our way now , clear to the top of that m@@ oun@@ t@@ ain ."
And now the challenge is in ex@@ ec@@ ution .
"And as my good friend and ad@@ vis@@ er Am@@ ory Lo@@ v@@ ins says , &quot; If something ex@@ ists , it must be possible . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible ."
"If we , a pe@@ tro@@ -@@ inten@@ sive company can do it , any@@ body can ."
"And if any@@ body can , it fol@@ lo@@ ws that everybody can ."
"H@@ aw@@ ken ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ed business and indus@@ try , lea@@ ding human@@ kind away from the ab@@ y@@ ss because , with continu@@ ed un@@ ch@@ ec@@ ked dec@@ line of the bio@@ sp@@ here , a very d@@ ear person is at risk here — fran@@ k@@ ly , an un@@ accep@@ table risk ."
Wh@@ o is that person ?
N@@ ot you . N@@ ot I@@ .
But let me intro@@ du@@ ce you to the one who is most at risk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this m@@ oun@@ t@@ ain clim@@ b .
"On a T@@ u@@ es@@ day morning in Mar@@ ch of 199@@ 6 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , br@@ ing@@ ing them along and often not kno@@ wing whether I was connec@@ ting ."
"But about five days later back in A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ a , I re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed an em@@ ail from G@@ l@@ en@@ n Th@@ om@@ as , one of my people in the Califor@@ ni@@ a me@@ eting ."
He was s@@ ending me an origin@@ al po@@ em that he had com@@ posed after our T@@ u@@ es@@ day morning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most u@@ pl@@ i@@ f@@ ting moments of my life .
"Because it told me , by God , one person got it ."
"H@@ ere is what G@@ l@@ en@@ n wr@@ ote . And here is that person , most at risk ."
"P@@ lea@@ se me@@ et &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ out a name , an un@@ seen face , and kno@@ wing not your time or place , T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , though yet un@@ born , I met you first last T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ n ."
A w@@ ise friend intro@@ duc@@ ed us two .
"And through his so@@ ber@@ ing point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me ."
K@@ no@@ wing you has changed my thinking .
"For I never had an in@@ k@@ ling that perhaps the things I do might some@@ day , some@@ how thre@@ at@@ en you ."
"T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , my d@@ aughter , son , I &apos;m af@@ rai@@ d I &apos;ve just beg@@ un to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should ."
"B@@ eg@@ in , I will ."
"The way the cost of what I squ@@ and@@ er , what is lost , if ever I for@@ get that you will some@@ day come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ d &quot; &quot; has spo@@ ken to me with one simple but prof@@ ound message , which I pres@@ u@@ me to share with you ."
"We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life ."
"The continu@@ um of human@@ ity , sure , but in a larg@@ er sense , the web of life itself ."
"And we have a cho@@ ice to make during our bri@@ ef , bri@@ ef vis@@ it to this beautiful bl@@ ue and green living planet : to h@@ ur@@ t it or to help it ."
"For you , it &apos;s your call ."
Thank you .
